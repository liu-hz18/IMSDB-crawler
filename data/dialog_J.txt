CAPTAIN MEDLEY: The level of arms on the ground eally depends . But no , I 'd have to say we have n't had to engage on the ground as heavily as we might have expected .
NEWSANCHOR: Have you lost any men today , Captain ?
CAPTAIN MEDLEY: No . One of my Corporals took a bullet to the head , but it looks like he might make it . Looks that way
DOCTOR: Sergeant Starks was very lucky . A little more to the right and it would n't have wanted to come out
MAJOR: But he 's never gon na be able to emember what happened ?
DOCTOR: It 's hard to say . Sergeant Starks could have retrograde amnesia or any form of psychological suppression . It 's very common with traumas like this .
LIEUTENANT: Sergeant , you have no surviving family in the States . I 'm sure you have friends or distant relatives , ut unfortunately we have no record of them yet .
MAJOR: Captain Medley has recommended you for the Purple Heart , Sergeant .
STARKS: Can I have one of those ?
LIEUTENANT: Of course .
DOCTOR: There is help for you , Sergeant .
LIEUTENANT: Of course there is .
STARKS [V.O.]: I did n't know where my home was . I just knew I did n't want to be there anymore .
JACKIE: Come on , mom . Do n't fall asleep
STARKS: You two ok ?
JACKIE: Our car wo n't start .
STARKS: Jean ? Jean , can you hear me ? I need you to try to wake up , Jean .
JACKIE: Yeah , but I do n't know what .
STARKS: What 's your name ?
JACKIE: Jackie .
STARKS: Nice to meet you , Jackie . Why do n't you wrap this scarf around yourself and try to keep your mom awake while I take a look at your car .
JACKIE: Nothing .
STARKS: Hey , can you reach the gas pedal ?
JACKIE: Yeah .
STARKS: Go ahead , turn it on . Keep pushing it .
JEAN: Get your fucking hands off my daughter !
JACKIE: Mom , he just fixed our car .
JEAN: Jackie , get in the car . NOW !
STARKS: Neither do I , ma'am . I 'll be on my way .
JACKIE: Mom , you 've got it wrong
STARKS: Yeah , I 'll hitch a ride or something . Let her throw it all up before she gets back behind the wheel .
JACKIE: What 're those ?
STARKS: Dog tags . They 've got your name and date of irth for identification .
JACKIE: What for ?
STARKS: In case you get lost , or ca n't emember who you are .
JACKIE: William Starks . Thanks .
STARKS: Yes .
DR. HALE: William Starks could be blocking the incident . It would explain his well- systematized scheme about the little girl and her mother . A delusion as complex as that can often replace the eality of an incident like this .
PROSECUTION: Gulf War Syndrome ? What theWhy do n't we start diagnosing Hard Life Syndrome while we 're at it ? I 've gotten a lot of convictions we could overturn with that logic
CAPTAIN MEDLEY: Sergeant Starks was awarded the Purple Heart . That award does n't applaud violence or murder . It applauds honor .
DEFENSE: For God 's sake , my client said he thinks he 's already died once . He does n't know what 's going on .
JURY FOREMAN: On the count of first degree murder , we find the defendant , William Starks , not guilty by reason of insanity .
JUDGE [O.S.]: Mr. Starks , I hope that someday you might be well so that we will have lost only one life in this tragedy .
DR. BECKER: How 'd he dodge a conviction ?
BECKER: William ? William , can you hear me ?
STARKS: So they say . What ?
BECKER: I 'm just looking at you . Does that make you uncomfortable ?
STARKS: Depends on what you 're seeing .
BECKER: You said you could n't remembe killing Officer Harrison . Correct ?
STARKS: You do n't believe me , do you ?
BECKER: It 's not my job to believe you .
NURSE HARDING: Come on , army boy . Time for some therapy .
STARKS: Wait . Wait a minute Please .
BECKER: No . I do n't think you do either . But neither of us can do anything about that .
NURSE HARDING: That 's not enough , is it ?
MACKENZIE: That 's Kingsley . Old bastard hears us , I 'm sure . He just does n't want to other answering so he makes us think he ca n't talk . I know . I tried it on my mother for two months once before she fished out my tongue . Literally . You 're the cop killer , right ?
STARKS: Yeah , guess so . How 'd you know ?
MACKENZIE: TV . Helps numb any active mind . Rudy MacKenzie .
MACKENZIE: That 's too bad . I do n't believe in disposable language either you know , the small talk , the little talk . Chit . Chat . Useless . The game 's something else though . Think about it What can we trade with each othe in the air between us ? This is our court . I 'm ready to throw the ball . Come on .
STARKS: Do n't you go to jail for that ?
MACKENZIE: I tried something like 30 times .
STARKS: Yeah , well 30 times probably would make you seem crazy .
MACKENZIE: Or just plain stupid . You 'd think by the twentieth time , I 'd have found an alternative method . Maybe a more effective one , if you know what I mean .
DR. LORENSON: Morning , gentlemen . How are you doing today ?
MACKENZIE: It 's a hard one for me , Dr. Lorenson . The world around me , it 's shrinking . There 's not even room for light to make its way in . Da-da-bum ! Da- da-bum ! I feel like the horseman of doom is coming for me , Doc . Only today , he 's not carrying flowers .
DR. LORENSON: And you , Mr. Starks ?
MACKENZIE: Of course you can , Doc . William , it was an absolute pleasure . Thanks fo playing .
DR. LORENSON: So you 're ok ?
STARKS: I am . One of the few things I emember doing is eating . So I guess I must be exercising it off in my dreams .
DR. LORENSON: Sure .
STARKS: Good .
DAMON: I 'm sorry , Starks . Must have not seen you coming there .
NURSE HARDING: You gon na get the fuck up ?
BECKER: I 'm glad to see you 're cooperating this time , Mr. Starks .
DR. GRIES: Hold him while I get the tranquilizer .
DAMON: Fuck the tranquilizer ! I got a foot .
BECKER: No . That 's not necessary .
DR. GRIES: WaitDr . Becker , how long do you want us to leave him in for ?
DR. GRIES: You ok ?
BECKER: I 'm fine .
DR. GRIES: Listen , I hate to bothe you
BECKER: Then do n't .
DR. GRIES: But what about Starks ?
BECKER: What about Starks ?
DR. GRIES: Should we be
BECKER: Should we be what ? Trying to change him any way we can ? Yes .
DR. GRIES: But the Jacket ? I meanshould we be leaving him in like that ? BECKER Leaving him in ? The medication I 'm given him is intended to adjust maybe even reset his violent proclivities . You know , peel away some of those layers of hate . The Jacket 's merely a safe place for that to happen . The grounds and the halls where I ca n't monitor side effects I ca n't predict are n't .
BECKER: It 's Christmas Eve , Justin . Do n't you have somewhere to be ?
NURSE HARDING: Ah , man , look , It 's A Wonderful Life .
DAMON: You got any booze ?
NURSE HARDING: 'Course I do . And it is the season for giving so let 's get to it .
WAITRESS: Where do you think you 're going ?
STARKS: I 'm not deaf .
WAITRESS: Good .
STARKS: Thanks .
WAITRESS: All right . You got somewhere you need to go , Mister ?
STARKS: I 'm not sure .
WAITRESS: Let me ask you that again . This time , look around and consider you options .
STARKS: I 'm not sure .
WAITRESS: You do n't have anywhere to stay ?
STARKS: I do n't think so .
WAITRESS: Well , where are you from ?
STARKS: I 'm not sure . I do n't really know .
WAITRESS: Of course you do n't know .
STARKS: Why `` of course '' ?
WAITRESS: Because in my life , it would n't make sense for me to pick up some normal guy with a place where he 's from and a place where he 's going to . It 'd be too simple . I probably would n't know how to handle a situation like that .
STARKS: Well , you definitely did n't pick normal or simple this time either .
WAITRESS: At least you 're honest . That 's some kind of start .
STARKS: I was dropped off .
WAITRESS: Do you have a motel or something ? Money ?
STARKS: No .
WAITRESS: Well , do n't you somewhere ? Stuff ? Belongings ?
STARKS: No . Not around here .
WAITRESS: All right , we 'll get to my place and call around , see where I can take you . Just do n't think of trying anything .
WAITRESS: Great . That was our last option . What am I going to do with you ?
STARKS: Nothing . Thanks fo inging me this far .
WAITRESS: Where are you going ? You 'll freeze out there . You do n't even have a coat .
STARKS: I 'll manage .
WAITRESS: No , you wo n't . You 'll die of cold out there and then I 'll have to feel guilty . And I 've already got more guilt than I know what to do with . Do you want something to drink ?
STARKS: No , I 'm ok .
WAITRESS: Shit ! That was one of my good glasses !
STARKS: Yeah , I 'm fine .
WAITRESS: You know what ? It 's Christmas Eve . And you look clean I mean , you 're normal-looking . It 's Christmas Eve , and I have a couch .
STARKS: I 'm not gon na hurt you .
WAITRESS: What 's this ?
STARKS: The best I could do with what was in your fridge .
WAITRESS: No , it 's fine . Thanks .
STARKS: Sure .
WAITRESS: This is pretty good . Considering
STARKS: Thanks .
WAITRESS: Yup . That 's me .
STARKS: You like it ?
WAITRESS: I do it .
STARKS: Have you always been a waitress ?
WAITRESS: Shit happens , and your life changes . 'Bout the best explanation of a lot of things that happen . So how come you do n't know where you 're coming from ?
STARKS: I do n't know , but I think part of it 's
WAITRESS: Well , good for you .
STARKS: Why ?
WAITRESS: Real is overrated .
STARKS: You do n't think that 's crazy ?
WAITRESS: Maybe . Maybe not .
BOB DYLAN: If you go when the snow flakes storm When the rivers freeze and summe ends . Please see she has a coat so warm To keep her from the howlin ' winds
STARKS: This is a great song .
WAITRESS: You remember it ?
STARKS: But hey , who can forget those words ? The man just wants simple and good things for his woman that she be warm and happy . How hard can that be to remember ?
WAITRESS: May be easy to remember , but not easy to get . Being warm , maybe but , look , you do n't even have a coat and I still have to chop wood to make a fire . And , being happyyou tell me if that 's simple .
STARKS: They told me I joined the army when I was seventeen . That 's when my fathe died and , before that , it was apparently just me and him since I was born 'cause my mom split .
WAITRESS: So you never knew your mother ?
STARKS: I guess not . But , as of now , I neve knew either .
WAITRESS: I 'm sorry .
STARKS: Yeah . How about you ?
WAITRESS: Never knew my father . I grew up with my mother . Actually , I grew up around my mother . She was great though . I mean , the way she was with he friends She was this woman who had so much life in her , she had to find ways to kill some of it just to be like the rest of us . She died young .
STARKS: How ?
WAITRESS: She fucked herself up day after day and then , one day , she fell asleep with a burning cigarette . I came home from work and she was gone .
STARKS: I 'm sorry .
WAITRESS: Yeah , me too . Every day fo the last ten years .
STARKS: That when you stopped being a nurse ?
DR. GRIES: William , can you hear me ?
STARKS: Jackie ? Jackie ?
JACKIE: Hm
STARKS: What year is it ?
JACKIE: Get the hell out of my house !
STARKS: I know it does n't make sense . It does n't even make sense to me .
JACKIE: If you do n't get out of my house ight now , I 'll call the police .
STARKS: Jackie , I 'm William Starks . I can prove it .
JACKIE: What ? Now you 're gon na show me some kind of driver 's license ?
STARKS: No , I do n't have anything to show you . I 'm here from a mental hospital .
JACKIE: Well , you belong in one .
STARKS: I 'm sorry for upsetting you , ut I 'm not lying to you .
JACKIE: You ca n't be William Starks . He 's dead .
STARKS: What ?
JACKIE: William Starks is dead I 've een to his grave .
STARKS: What ?
JACKIE: His body was found New Year 's Day , 191993 . At Alpine
STARKS: How ?
JACKIE: No , you did n't . They found William Starks ' body dead in the snow .
STARKS: How 'd he die ?
JACKIE: I do n't know . But he did die .
STARKS: It 's December 25th , 1993 today .
JACKIE: No , it 's not . It 's Decembe 25th , 2004 .
STARKS: I 'll leave . But look at me . Look at my face , Jackie . I 'm not lying . I met you and your mother . I told you then that I 'd lost my memory . There was no one for miles around so I know you know there 's no way I could have known that from a pair of dog tags you had lying around .
JACKIE: Please
MEDLEY: You walk on . They pick up their guns and fire at you , you stay . They pick up and fire at each other , and you walk on !
STARKS: He 's got his gun pointed at a kid .
MEDLEY: That is not our problem .
STARKS: Yeah , well , none of this is ou fuckin ' problem .
MEDLEY: We are leaving this site right now .
BECKER: You left him in all night ?
NURSE HARDING: Shit , he 's probably dead .
BECKER: Do n't get all worked up , Justin . I expected some common sense on you part and clearly I was expecting too much . Just open the drawer .
DR. GRIES: We never should have done this to him
BECKER: Well , what are we gon na do about it now ?
DR. GRIES: Is he ? Is he dead ?
BECKER: No . Get him upstairs .
LORENSON: Where 's William Starks .
NURSE: I 'm not sure . Dr. Becker had him moved .
BECKER: He 's recovering on the third floor .
LORENSON: Are you kidding me ? He 's not psychotic !
BECKER: Then how would you describe him , Beth ? Merely rebellious ?
LORENSON: He 'll be a zombie in a few days , Tom . His behavior 's hardly suggested he needed neuroleptics .
BECKER: And you know that from what , a couple two-minute stares across a room ?
LORENSON: You sure he was n't provoked ?
BECKER: You sure you want to begin making that kind of insinuation ? I took five stitches during a routine therapy session .
LORENSON: I 'm sure he took some , too .
BECKER: Yes , they are .
LORENSON: He 's not gon na end up like Casey , Tom . Whatever happened to him is not going to `` happen '' to Starks . I do n't know what you 're trying to do here but he 's not a lab animal , Tom . You ca n't reprogram him no matter the drugs or the treatment .
BECKER: Jesus , you really do n't let up , do you ? Just because you failed you patient does n't necessarily mean the est of us did , too . Sorry to tarnish your war hero 's image , but he is psychotic .
JACKIE: Hi , Claire .
CLAIRE: Jackie , hi . How are you , honey ?
JACKIE: I 'm ok . I need a favor .
STARKS: What the hell kind of drugs are you people giving me ?
BECKER [O.S.]: Just something to help you sleep .
BECKER: I said the drugs were to help you sleep . Did you sleep well ?
STARKS: It 's December 26th ?
BECKER: That 's right , William .
STARKS: I do n't know better . All I know is that you left me in there .
BECKER: In where ?
STARKS: In that thingthe Jacket .
BECKER: We were forced to use restrains if that 's what you 're referring to .
STARKS: That was n't a fucking restraint .
BECKER: Actually , that 's exactly what ou equipment is .
STARKS: Do n't act like I do n't know what 's eal . I 'm not the one that 's crazy here .
BECKER: Of course you 're not .
STARKS: Do n't give me that . I know what 's eal , goddamnit ! You strapped me in something and stuck me in a drawer .
BECKER: I had a patient a few years ago . His name was Ted Casey
STARKS: I do n't give a shit about you patient !
BECKER: I was n't pausing to see if you did . But , incidentally , you should , ecause you 're birds of a feather .
STARKS: We are not birds of a feather .
BECKER: Maybe not . But I do think you 're in a tree woofing like a dog . And I 'm just trying to help you the only way I can think of .
JACKIE [O.S.]: They found William Starks ' body dead in the snow .
STARKS [O.S.]: How 'd he die ?
JACKIE [O.S.]: I do n't know . But he did die .
LORENSON: Hey . You 're not supposed to be out here .
STARKS: And if I did n't want to come ?
LORENSON: I guess I 'd ask you why .
STARKS: Because I do n't think I 'm crazy .
LORENSON: You 're not crazy .
STARKS: That conviction does n't convince me of anything . Until I know that I did it , I 'm not going to accept that I did .
LORENSON: You may never remember at all . Your mind 's grasp of reality and the eal events that have happened to you has been damaged .
STARKS: No . The real events that have happened to me have been fucked up . Not my mind .
LORENSON: William , I 'd like to ask you something if I can .
STARKS: Since when do people around here have to ask permission to do anything ?
LORENSON: I could try tomake it stop .
STARKS: No . I do n't want it to .
LORENSON: So it 's helping ? STARKS It 's making me feel like a different person .
STARKS: Believe me , I know .
MACKENZIE: I was n't talking about anything .
STARKS: Yeah , you were . What you said about them taking me out to the woods
MACKENZIE: I know you need one when it 's really cold .
STARKS: MacKenzie , listen to me . Listen . I 'm going to die .
MACKENZIE: Mortality 's actually a great thing to e familiar with . It means you 're sane on some level .
STARKS: No , I mean in four days , I 'm supposed to die .
MACKENZIE: How do you know ?
STARKS: The Jacket .
MACKENZIE: Oh no , you 're pretty young . You ody 'll be able to handle a lot more of it than you think
STARKS: No . I mean I found out while I was in it that my body 's gon na be found in four days .
HARDING: What are you two yappin ' about ?
STARKS: Yeah , it is .
HARDING: You know something ? You 're two fucking freaks is what you are .
MACKENZIE: It 's gon na be sticky .
STARKS: Why ?
MACKENZIE: 'Cause Lorenson 's got her claws in it now . When she started getting suspicious about me was when they stopped using it on me . Women !
STARKS: So what am I supposed to do ?
MACKENZIE: You could still always give Becker an itch . 'Course you might get killed when he goes to scratch it , but seems to me you 're saying that 's about to happen anyway . Just be careful not to walk yourself right into something .
DR. GRIES: We 're late .
LORENSON: I wish they 'd skip the formality of this annual review and just cut ou udget . Our silence on the matte should be enough to appease the civic conscience without wasting an hour we do n't have .
DR. GRIES: Maybe it 's not such a waste .
LORENSON: It 's the ticking of a box on a sheet of paper no one cares about .
DR. GRIES: They do n't care about all the things we do right . But they might they might care about what we 're doing wrong . That 's what they should come here to look for .
LORENSON: What should they be looking for ?
DR. GRIES: They should just be looking harder .
LORENSON: Where ? It 's Becker is n't it ? He 's doing stuff , is n't he ?
DR. GRIES: Later . I 'll tell you about it later . We got a session to catch now .
SALLY: Are you ok ?
STARKS: Yeah , Why are you in this ward alone ? Where is everyone ?
SALLY: In the therapy session downstairs . That 's what the rep 's sitting in on
STARKS: Ok , listen . I want you to get out of here and lock the door behind you . I 'll go get some doctors .
BECKER: Mr. Starks , this session is for ou civil patients . Damon , please take Mr. Starks back to his ward .
JENSEN: Well , I 've been approached by the Federal Trade Organization .
BECKER: The Organizationfor the Organized ?
JENSEN: That 's right . Have you heard of them ?
BECKER: No , Mr. Jensen . I have not .
JENSEN: That is categorically not true . Bl-bl- latantly and manifestly NOT TRUE . I 've been asked to lead them . But , if you 'd heard of them , then they would n't be hush-hush , would they ?
BECKER: And how is that ?
STARKS: When I was in the Gulf , the Organization was recruiting the Organized .
JENSEN: I knew it ! I knew it ! Those little fuckers are everywhere .
STARKS: They recruit only the best , Mr. Jensen . I did n't want to have to say this
BECKER: Sit down , Mr. Starks ! Sit down , Mr. Starks !
RANDOM PATIENTS: Dr. Thatcher ! Dr. Becker !
DAMON: Starks , you 're like a mule . You 're eal stubborn . But there 's ways of fixin ' that . All you need is a good stick . Here 's your stick .
TENNY: You ever been to jail ?
STARKS: No .
TENNY: It 's worse than war . It 's worse than anywhere you 've ever been .
STARKS: I doubt it . I do n't think prison 's so bad you do n't want to emember it
TENNY: Well , I 've never been to war , but I 'm sure as hell not going back to prison .
OFFICER HARRISON: Gentlemen , I 'm gon na need you to step out of the car , with your hands at your side please .
STARKS: Why ?
OFFICER HARRISON: This is a stolen vehicle you 're driving . Now put your hands in the air , out where I can see 'em .
STARKS: Jesus Christ , what 'd you do that for ?
TENNY: Man , if you 're so deaf and dumb , you ai n't even worth a fucking bullet .
JACKIE: I 'll be off in 15 minutes . Can you wait till then ?
STARKS: Yeah .
JACKIE: It was banned , you know and it led to an investigation of Dr. Becker 's mistreatment of some of his patients . That 's when they found out how badly he was drugging his patients
STARKS: After I
JACKIE: You bled to death .
STARKS: What ?
JACKIE: I do n't know how you got the cut to your head , but you died bleeding from it .
STARKS: Do you really believe me ?
JACKIE: I do n't know . I thought I was crazy after you left that day . I died . I still think I could be crazy . But then I replayed that night in my head the parts of it I could remember and it was likeI do n't care if I was , or am . I have n't felt that way in a room with someone my whole life . And when you left , all I wanted was
STARKS: Yes .
JACKIE: Then we need to figure out what happened to you . It 's the only thing we can do .
STARKS: I know .
JACKIE: Alpine Grove still exists . I looked it up on the net . We should go there and see if there 's still anyone around who might have known what happened to you .
STARKS: If they do n't take me out before then . What 's the net ?
JACKIE: I know .
STARKS: How ? Did they figure it out after I died ?
JACKIE: No . They never figured it out . I did . Most murderers do n't stop to help a drunk woman and her little girl on the side of the road . Not without hurting them .
DR. MORGAN: I 'm sorry I ca n't tell you more about your father 's death , Mr. Starks . Ou own medical examiners determined only that he died from a blunt trauma to the head but that was right around the time the Alpine Grove 's staff changed and I 'm afraid we did n't have the best record system before then .
STARKS: His body was found on January 1 , 1993 , but do you know if that was long after he had died ?
DR. MORGAN: No , I do n't . I 'm sorry . I wish I knew more .
STARKS: What about Dr. Thomas Becker or Dr. Loel Lorenson ? There was also a Dr. Gries , I think .
DR. MORGAN: Well , Dr. Lorenson is still here at the hospital . If she was here at the time your father was , then I 'm sure she 'd be of more help to you .
STARKS: What about Dr. Becker and Mr. Gries ?
DR. MORGAN: Unfortunately , I 'm not familiar with Dr. Becker and Dr. Gries passed away three , four years ago .
JACKIE: Do you have any kind of forwarding address for Dr. Becker ?
DR. MORGAN: Your father was here 12 years ago . I doubt the hospital would have that , if Dr. Becker is still even alive . Is there a particular reason you need to know how your father died ?
STARKS: He was the only family I remember .
DR. MORGAN: Let me just tell her we 're here .
LORENSON: Hello . I 'm Beth Lorenson .
JACKIE: I 'm just William 's friend .
LORENSON: I think we 'll be fine from here . Thanks , Stanley .
STARKS: I never knew my father . Did you ?
LORENSON: Yeah , I did . He was my most memorable patient .
STARKS: Why ?
LORENSON: At the end , he made me change my mind about a lot of things .
STARKS: You thought my father was crazy ?
LORENSON: No . I do n't think he was crazy . He needed helpbut he was n't crazy . Your father actually helped me with a case of mine .
STARKS: What case ?
LORENSON: I was working with a boy named Eugene .
JACKIE: Who was Eugene ?
LORENSON: It 's complicated , but in a way , your father let me know how I 'd get through to him .
JACKIE: How ?
LORENSON: He just saidthat I 'd shock Eugene and then things would change for him .
JACKIE: I do n't understand .
LORENSON: I still do n't either , even after all these years .
STARKS: Do you know how my father died ?
LORENSON: I do n't know .
STARKS: But Dr. Morgan said you were around when my father was
LORENSON: I was . But I saw a lot of cuts and a lot of blows . I 'm sorry I do n't know more about your father 's . I did n't know about everything that went on here .
STARKS: Well , do you think Dr. Becker would have any idea ?
LORENSON: How do you know about Dr. Becker ?
STARKS: My dad wrote some things down before he died .
LORENSON: That 's right . He did .
STARKS: Why would we do that ?
JACKIE: Because Becker resigned after the charges brought against him by State Patient Advocacy Groups .
LORENSON: I see you 've done your homework . Alpine Grove 's undergone a lot of changes since then . At the time , we did n't have theresources to help our patients the way we needed to . Now , we do . And things are different .
STARKS: I would n't be so sure . Like you said about back then , you might not know everything going on around here .
LORENSON: It 's important for you to know who your father was , is n't it ?
STARKS: Yeah , it is .
LORENSON: Well let me know how you search turns out .
STARKS: We will .
JACKIE: Me neither . Who was the boy she was talking about , Eugene ?
STARKS: I have no idea .
JACKIE: You think Lorenson kills you ?
STARKS: Maybe . I do n't know . Seems more likely Becker does , but at the very least she knows how I died .
JACKIE: Let 's see if they have an address fo Becker . I also want to figure out more about the kid you helped he with .
STARKS: Why ?
JACKIE: Because that 's the part I believe is true . You probably did help he somehow with the boy and Eugene 's name did come up over and over again on the abstracts I pulled .
STARKS: There 's one more thing I want to see .
JACKIE: Maybe this was n't such a good idea
STARKS: Yes , it was . My fingers were the only things I could move . Dead bodies do n't bleed . And they certainly ca n't claw so hard they dent metal .
DAMON: You folks ai n't supposed to be down here .
JACKIE: We were just leaving .
DAMON: Do I know you from somewhere ?
STARKS: You may have known my father , William Starks . DAMON smiles , remembering
DAMON: That 's right ! Goddamn , you 're the spitting image . I did n't know he had a son .
STARKS: He did n't either .
DAMON: Oh yeah , sure . He killed a cop , ight ?
STARKS: You would n't happen to know how he died , would you ?
DAMON: Oh yeah , what 'd he say ?
STARKS: He said you were a sadistic fuck that elonged in jail .
DAMON: Look here , I do n't like you getting in my face and saying this bullshit to me
STARKS: That 's too bad .
DAMON: I thought you said you never knew your father .
STARKS: I did n't . Did you have anything to do with his death ?
DAMON: I do n't know what you 're talking about , man . I swear . This is some weird shit you 're telling me and I do n't know how come you 're doing it .
STARKS: He died because he bled to death from a blow to his head . Someone had to have given him it .
DAMON: I never touched your father ! I swear !
STARKS: You know something , Damon ? You 're like a mule . You 're real stubborn . But there 's ways of fixin ' that . All you need is a good stick . Here 's your stick . Live with it .
JACKIE: How long do we have ?
STARKS: I do n't know .
JACKIE: They told me Becker 's in Shelbourne now . I looked him up and he was listed .
STARKS: How far away is that ?
JACKIE: What about Captain Medley ? He neve told them what happened to you ove there . His testimonythat coward wanted them to think you were crazy .
STARKS: I know . It was perfect . Erase my sanity and you erase anything I 'll ever say .
JACKIE: You 've got to get yourself out of that place . They 're going to kill you if you do n't .
STARKS: I might not be able to .
JACKIE: It 's not a prison , it 's a hospital . There 's got to be some way out of there and you 've got to find it
LORENSON: You 'll die if you keep smoking those in your condition .
STARKS: I 'll die either way .
LORENSON: I ca n't try to help you unless you let me . I know about the Jacket .
STARKS: You have no idea what 's going on .
LORENSON: No , I do . That 's what I 'm saying to you .
STARKS: Listen to me ! You do n't ! The Jacket is my only chance in this place .
LORENSON: How can you say that in your physical condition ? Do you realize that it 's ecause you were put in it that you 're asweak as you are now ? Becker 's a man who 's not well himself .
STARKS: You do n't understand .
LORENSON: Then help me understand . You know , you 're not alone . A lot of Gulf Vets have begun to experience curious symptoms . What you have might well be a syndrome and , if so , it 's not one we know enough about to be treating it this vigorously .
STARKS: This has nothing to do with that .
LORENSON: Where is that from ?
STARKS: I do n't know . Remember ?
LORENSON: Come on . Tell me what you do know .
STARKS: I 've seen a time that 's not this time . And I 'm only able to see it when I 'm in the Jacket .
LORENSON: Well , what time is it ?
LORENSON: Ok fine . Tell me about it . Tell me about the future . 2004 . What does it look like ?
STARKS: It does n't look all that different .
LORENSON: The future does n't look different ?
STARKS: No . Not for people like me . Not in the places I come from .
LORENSON: What about the world ?
STARKS: I did n't see that much of it same as now . I only saw it as part of my own life .
LORENSON: Do you think you 're traveling in time ? Is that it ?
STARKS: Not everyone in here is crazy , Doc .
LORENSON: Like who ? Like MacKenzie maybe ?
STARKS: Maybe .
LORENSON: MacKenzie locked himself up in his house for two months and nearly starved himself to death before he was brought here . All because his wife left him for another man .
LORENSON: Why do n't you help me ?
STARKS: Because I do n't have time .
LORENSON: Why not ?
STARKS: I 'm about to die unless I do something to stop it .
LORENSON: And how do you know that ?
STARKS: Because of the future . I know what 's going to happen .
LORENSON: William , that is just another facet of my delusions .
STARKS: And what about your work with Eugene the kid ? Is that another facet of my delusions ?
LORENSON: How do you know about Eugene ?
STARKS: You told me about him . I saw you and I think you thought I knew something about him . So you told me .
LORENSON: There obviously is , so what do n't you just tell me how you found out about him .
STARKS: Some part of you suspects even if you do n't know for sure that what I 'm saying is true .
LORENSON: I do n't know how you know about Eugene , but these ideas are part of your delusions .
STARKS: NO ! They 're not my delusions ! Look , just leave my business with Becker to me !
LORENSON: One thing 's got nothing to do with the other .
STARKS: One 's got everything to do with the other . So unless you want my blood on your handsleave what 's between me and Becker between me and Becker .
MACKENZIE: Hey , I brought you some smokes .
STARKS: Lorenson said your wife left you fo another man and that 's when you lost it .
MACKENZIE: Geez , how 's that for a fucking `` thank you '' ?
STARKS: Is it true ?
MACKENZIE: She left me , I tried to kill her , I tried to kill myself . She was mean , I was weak , I was cruel so she left , I did n't plan it , did n't see itFINE !
STARKS: MacKenzie , what if we are crazy ?
MACKENZIE: What if we are ? There 're crazier things than thinking up fictions for yourself . Everyone does it , do n't they ? Even Becker . That roller coaster car pops more pills than all of Ward 3 .
STARKS: Becker does ? Are you sure ?
MACKENZIE: I 've been here for 11 years . It 's my neighborhood . 'Course I 'm sure . He 's as drugged up as the rest of usI guess he has to be to put up with all this .
STARKS: Thanks for the cigarettes . You still got a lot of problems , MacKenzie , but you 're ok .
BECKER: At least it 's some kind of bars we 've got you behind .
STARKS: That 's too bad .
BECKER: It is . But when it comes down to it , you just have to patient with them . They 'd rather have their vacation , too , so they just push dealing with our `` practices '' off to the New Year .
STARKS: They make it hard for you to get away with your business , huh ?
BECKER: Temporarily .
STARKS: Makes it a little easier for me to get away with mine .
BECKER: And what 's that ?
STARKS: My business ?
BECKER: Yes .
STARKS: Getting away with things . Like whatever I may or may not have gotten away with Officer Harrison .
BECKER: You killed him ?
STARKS: And wound up in a better cage . But I still want to make a deal .
BECKER: I thinkI have to think about it .
STARKS: You sure you know where to find one ?
BECKER: I 've managed to every Sunday of my life . Some of us are God- fearing men , Starks .
STARKS: And what does that mean ?
BECKER: Means we believe in doing his work and fear what the world would be like if we did n't at least try to .
STARKS: Becker , how do you sleep at night ?
BECKER: You in here . Works like a drug .
LORENSON: Nina , William Starks is to stay in ICU all night . If anything is supposed to change , I want to be called about it .
NINA: Sure , Dr. Lorenson .
LORENSON: Hi . Sorry I 'm late .
TALIA: It 's ok. Hi , Eugene .
LORENSON: Talia , I need to ask you something .
TALIA: What is it ?
LORENSON: Have you told anyone about my sessions with Eugene ?
TALIA: No . I would have told you .
DAMON: No funny business or we can make this a lot fucking harder for you .
STARKS: No funny business .
LORENSON: Eugene , this is a `` TRAIN . ''
JACKIE: You just scared me , that 's all .
STARKS: Me , too .
JACKIE: Here , drink this . I 'll get the heat going .
JACKIE [O.S.]: I think this is his house .
STARKS: You 're sure ?
JACKIE: Yeah . I called the number yesterday to make sure . Thomas Becker , retired
STARKS: They 're not .
JACKIE: No .
STARKS: There 're no cars on this street .
JACKIE: Yeah , you 're right . But wait , how can that be ?
STARKS: I do n't know . Maybe that 's because this whole thing is a dream . How can you have a street with no cars on it ?
JACKIE: I do n't know . But this is n't a dream . I 'm real , and so is where we are .
STARKS: Then why is n't there anyone around ?
JACKIE: I do n't know .
STARKS: Of course he will . What day of the week is it ?
JACKIE: It 's Sunday .
STARKS: Look where these people live .
JACKIE: William , you 're not making sense .
STARKS: They 're at Church . And I bet that 's where Becker is .
BECKER'S GRANDSON: Grandpa ?
STARKS: I do n't know , Dr. Becker . Can you ?
BECKER: Who are you ?
STARKS: I think you know . Your eyes say you do .
BECKER: You 're his son ?
STARKS: No . I 'm not his son . I 'm him . What ? You look like you 've seen a ghost . You can come here and touch me , old man . I 'm the real thing .
BECKER: Howhow are you here ?
STARKS: I know . You killed me , did n't you ?
BECKER: No . I did n't . I swear I did n't . I probably helped push you to kill yourself , but I did n't do it .
STARKS: I did n't kill myself . I died from a low to the head . How 'd it happen ? I have to know .
BECKER: I do n't know how you died . The last time I put you in the Jacket was just after you told me you remembered killing that police officer
STARKS: I did n't say I remembered killing him . I just repeated some words to get myself back in there .
BECKER: I know . I knew that when you came out .
STARKS: How ?
BECKER: Becausebecause you came out and said something you could n't have possibly have known . You came back and repeated three names
STARKS: Medication ? What kind of meds do you chase with nights in a cadave drawer ?
BECKER: It was part of the treatment I intendedI did n't know what the effects would be
STARKS: So , what , you guinea pig sick people to find out ?
BECKER: The three of you were n't regula patients . You were criminals that ended up at Alpine Grove .
STARKS: No , we were patients .
BECKER: You and the others did n't seem that way then .
STARKS: Who were the others ?
BECKER: What is it ?
STARKS: You just told me . The last time I was with you was when I was in the Jacket . I 'm in it right now , Dr. Becker .
BECKER: I do n't understand
STARKS: I 'm in it as we speak . You 're haunting yourself right now . I guess sometimes we indict ourselves if no one else does . You did n't make history like you wanted to , huh , Dr. Becker . It turned out different , did n't it ?
BECKER: I did n't put you in Alpine Grove .
STARKS: No . You put me on drugs and then you put me in the Jacket .
JACKIE: That 's all you got from him ? That astard helped take your life away from you .
STARKS: No , he did n't .
JACKIE: What ? How can you say that ? He 's the one that put you in that goddamn medievalJacket . He 's probably the one who killed you .
STARKS: No one 's killing anyone .
JACKIE: Why are you saying that ? We do n't have long , do we ?
STARKS: Where are we going ?
JACKIE: To the hospital .
STARKS: What 's happening to me ? Why am I getting so much weaker ?
JACKIE: Because your body can only take so much of what they 're putting you through .
CLAIRE: Jesus , what 's happened to him ?
STARKS: Lorenson 's the only one that could let me out of there . I need something to persuade her that I was there . Get me something to take to her .
JACKIE: Ok. Ssh . Rest .
CLAIRE: No , no . Not yet . But he does n't have long . Are you sure you do n't want a doctor to look at him ?
JACKIE: No ! It wo n't do any good . Please , Claire . They wo n't understand .
TENNY: Hey , Mister , you need a ride ?
STARKS: Where are you going ?
TENNY: I 'm going to Canada but I can let you ride with me up to the border .
STARKS: Sure .
TENNY: Great , get in . We 'll switch off in a bit .
JACKIE: William , please , honey , wake up . For me .
STARKS: Jackie ?
JACKIE: What ?
STARKS: When we first met , when you were 7 , where was the house you lived in with your mother ? Do you remembe your address ?
JACKIE: 112 Orchard Way . You 're not coming back , are you ?
STARKS: You got ta stop thinking like that .
JACKIE: Then , where are you going ?
STARKS: Nowhere . I just think I 'm gon na be sick .
LORENSON: I know . I know it all . Save you strength . I already know everything you 're going to say . You 're in the Jacket right now , are n't you ?
STARKS: Howhow do you know ?
LORENSON: You told me this was how it happened .
STARKS: I did ?
LORENSON: Yeah .
STARKS: Whowho kills me ?
LORENSON: You have nothing to fear , William .
STARKS: NathanPiechowski . Jackson MacGregorTed Casey . You did n't cure them . You killed them .
SALLY: Would you like anything , Dr. Lorenson ?
LORENSON: A cup of coffee would be great , Sally . Thanks .
SALLY: Is he gon na be ok ?
LORENSON: I hope so .
SALLY: Me , too .
LORENSON: You 're going to be ok , William . We just need to get your fever down and we 'll be able to hopefully stabilize you .
STARKS: Who are you kidding , Doc ? You o me ?
LORENSON: What for ?
STARKS: You still do n't believe me , do you ?
LORENSON: I do believe you
STARKS: No . Listen to methe kid , Eugene
LORENSON: William , I ca n't indulge these delusions , even when you 're in this state .
STARKS: Listen to me . That 's all I ask .
LORENSON: Who told you this ?
STARKS: You did , in the future . You figured it out because a part of you already knows this . That 's how it works . I 'm just telling you something you already know , even if you have n't ealized it .
LORENSON: What are you talking about ?
STARKS: You 'll figure it out and you 'll do good by him .
LORENSON: Hey .
TALIA: What is it ?
LORENSON: Come on Eugene , try to say it with me . This is a `` DOG '' .
EUGENE: Dd-d .
LORENSON: Are you having a seizure ? Is that eally what 's going on ?
EUGENE: Dog . Hi .
LORENSON: You ok , Eugene ?
TALIA: What 's happening ?
LORENSON: No , but he is having seizures .
STARKS: It worked , did n't it ?
DR. LORENSON: What do you need me to do ?
STARKS: Thank you .
DR. LORENSON: I ca n't take you out of here in your condition
STARKS: And I ca n't stay here in my condition . I am going to die tonight . It 's already been decided .
DR. LORENSON: No , it has n't .
STARKS: Yes . It has . Everything up 'till today is done . Everything starting with tomorrow is up fo grabs .
LORENSON: Sure . It 's an easy address . A little far out there , but easy enough .
STARKS: Good .
LORENSON: You want me to come with you ?
STARKS: No , I 'll be ok .
JACKIE: I 've been ok .
STARKS: Good . How 's your mom ?
JACKIE: Ok , I guess .
STARKS: Do you think I could see her ?
JACKIE: Sure .
JEAN: Can I help you ?
STARKS: Hey , Jean . Nice to see you .
JEAN: I 'm sorry ? Your face looks awfully familiar , I just ca n't quite place it
JACKIE: Mom , this is the guy that drove us home that afternoon we were stuck on the highway . The guy you yelled at for no good reason
JEAN: Oh , yeah .
STARKS: You could say that .
JEAN: Jackie , go play in the snow .
JACKIE: Why ?
JEAN: Just do it .
STARKS: I ca n't stay long . That 's my doctor and I got ta get back to the hospital . Everything I want to say is in this letter . You can check as much of it as you can .
JEAN: Thanks . You , too .
JACKIE: Hey , wait !

SIDNEY: Hi , I 'm Sidney . And I love to TEC-9 . The popular TEC-9 is advertised by its makers as being tough as the toughest customer .
ORDELL: This TEC-9 ? They advertise it as eing the most popular gun in American crime . Can you believe that shit ? It actually says that on the little booklet that comes with it . `` Most Popular Gun in American Crime , '' like they 're proud of that shit .
LOUIS: Who 's your partner ?
ORDELL: Mr. Walker . He runs a fishing boat in Mexico . I deliver the merchandise to him , gets it to my customers . On all my bulk sales , anyway . Nigga did n't have a pot to piss in or a window to throw it out 'fore I set 'em up . Now , motherfucker 's rollin ' in cash . He got himself a yacht , with all kinds of high tech navigational shit on it . AK-47 , the very best there is .
ORDELL CONT'D: Get that for me , will ya baby ?
MELANIE: You know it 's for you .
ORDELL: Girl , you better not make me go ove there and put my feet to ya .
MELANIE: Hello .

LOUIS: I can sit through it once .
MELANIE: He thinks he 's Joe Gunn now .
LOUIS: I 'm impressed . He knows a lot .
MELANIE: He 's just repeating shit he overheard . He ai n't any more a gun expert than I am .
LOUIS: Sure .
MELANIE: When did you get out of jail ?
LOUIS: Four days ago .
MELANIE: Where at ?
LOUIS: Susanville .
MELANIE: How long ?
LOUIS: Two months shy of four years .
MELANIE: Four years ?
LOUIS: Uh-huh .
MELANIE: What for ?
LOUIS: Bank robbery .
MELANIE: Really , I 'm impressed .
ORDELL: See , what did I tell you ? Man in New York wants a 9 millimeter Smith and Wesson Model 5946 . Why does he want it ? It 's the gun that nigga on `` New York Undercover '' uses . Because of that nigga , I can sell it to this nigga for twelve-fifty .
LOUIS: What 's your cost ?
ORDELL: As low as two .
LOUIS: Are you serious ?
ORDELL: That 's what I been tellin ' you . Start adding these motherfuckin ' figures up , and you tell me this ai n't a usiness to be in .
LOUIS: That 's good money .

LOUIS: Then what ?
ORDELL: I get out . Spend the rest of my life spending .
MELANIE: It 's Beaumont .
ORDELL: Beaumont¢Ordell . What 's the problem ? What the fuck you doin ' in jail ? What the fuck you doin ' that for ? Ai n't you got better sense than to be drivin ' drunk carrying a goddam pistol ?
MAX: Use that coffee cup on the desk .
ORDELL: And I need me a bond for ten thousand .
MAX: That 's Winston . He works here .
ORDELL: He 's a big one . You two tight ?
MAX: Yeah .
ORDELL: It was our idea to take the picture , was n't it ?
MAX: So , you want a ten-thousand dolla ond . What 've you got for collateral ?
ORDELL: Gon na have to put up cash .
MAX: You have it with you ?
ORDELL: It 's in my bag .
MAX: You have cash . What do you need me for ?
ORDELL: C'mon , you know how they do . Black man comes in with ten thousand , they wan na fuck with 'em . First off , they gon na wan na know where I got it . Second , they gon na keep a big chunk of it - start talkin ' that court cost shit . Fuck that shit , Jack . I 'll go through you .
MAX: Cost you a thousand for the bond .
ORDELL: I know that .
MAX: Who 's it for ? A relative ?
ORDELL: Fella named Beaumont . They have him up at county . It started out drunk driving , but they wrote it up `` possession of a concealed weapon . '' Dumb monkey-ass had a pistol on him .
MAX: Ten thousand sounds high .
ORDELL: They ran his name and got a hit . He 's een in before . Besides , Beaumont 's from Kentucky , and I think they 're prejudiced against black men from the South out here .
MAX: He takes off and I got ta go to Kentucky to bring him back , you pay the expenses .
ORDELL: You think you could do that ?
MAX: I 've done it .
ORDELL: Beaumont . That 's the only name I know .
MAX: Records office .
LOUIS: I 'm going to wait in the car .
ORDELL: Sure . We almost done , ai n't we ?
MAX: Getting there .
ORDELL: You go wait in the car . Wait a minute .
LOUIS: Which one is for the car ?
ORDELL: This one 's for the ignition but you got ta hit this thing to shut the alarm off and unlock the door .
LOUIS: What do I do ?
ORDELL: You ai n't got to do nothing . Just point at it and push the button . You 'll hear the car go `` bleep . '' That means the alarm 's off and the doors are open .
LOUIS: Okay .
ORDELL: Now play the volume as loud as you want but do n't touch my levels . I got them set just the way I want 'em .
MAX: Beaumont Livingston .
ORDELL: Livingston , huh ?
MAX: On his prior , he served nine months , and he 's working on four years ' probation .
ORDELL: You do n't say .
MAX: Do you know what he 's on probation for ?
ORDELL: Have n't a clue .
MAX: Possession of unregistered machine guns .
ORDELL: Will they consider this a violation of his probation ?
MAX: They do consider this a violation of his probation . Your boy 's looking at ten years , plus the concealed weapon .
ORDELL: Man , he wo n't like that . Beaumont do n't got a doin ' time disposition .
MAX: I need your name and address .

MAX: House or apartment ?
ORDELL: House .
MAX: Now I need you to count your money .
ORDELL: Hope you do n't mind me askin ' where you keepin ' my money till I get it ack . In your drawer ?
MAX: Across the street a Great Western . It goes in a trust account . You 'll need to fill out an Application fo Appearance Bond , an Indemnity Agreement , a Contingent Promissory Note . That 's the one , if Beaumont skips and I go after him , you pay the expenses .
ORDELL: Beaumont ai n't going nowhere . Where do I sign ?
MAX: Yes .
ORDELL: I was wondering . What if before the court date gets here , Beaumont gets hit by a bus or something and dies . I get my money back , do n't I ?
BEAUMONT: Who is it ?
ORDELL: It 's your benefactor , nigga . Buzz me up .
BEAUMONT: What the fuck can I say ? I 'm serious , man . What the fuck can I say ? Thank you thank you thank you .
ORDELL: Who was there for your ass ?
BEAUMONT: You were there for me .
ORDELL: Who ?
BEAUMONT: You .
ORDELL: You goddam right !
BEAUMONT: I 'm still scared as a motherfucker , Ordell . They talkin ' like they serious 'bout me doin ' that machine gun time .
ORDELL: Naw , man . They just tryin ' to put a fright in your ass .
BEAUMONT: If that 's what they want to do , they 're doin ' it .
ORDELL: How old is that machine gun shit ?
BEAUMONT: Three years .
ORDELL: Three years . That crime 's old , man . They ai n't got room in prison for all the motherfuckers out there killin ' people . How they gon na find room fo you ?
BEAUMONT: That 's not what they 're tellin ' me .
ORDELL: That 's why they call it `` fuckin ' with ya . '' Now you wan na hear how we etaliate ?
BEAUMONT: Hey , c'mon in , man . I was just - you know - smokin ' a fatty , watchin ' TV .
ORDELL: Naw , man . I got ta be someplace . I was kinda hopin you could come with me .
BEAUMONT: What 'd ya mean ?
ORDELL: Look , I hate to be the kinda nigga , does a nigga a favor - then BAM - hits a nigga up for a favor in eturn . But I 'm afraid I got ta be that kinda nigga .
BEAUMONT: What ?
ORDELL: I need a favor .
BEAUMONT: That requires me goin out tonight ?
ORDELL: A bit .
BEAUMONT: Aaaaawww man , I was n't plannin ' on goin no place . It 's twelve o'clock , man . I 'm home , I 'm high -
ORDELL: Why the fuck you at home ? Cause I spent ten thousand dollars gittin ' your ass home . Look , I got ta problem . I need help , and you can help me .
BEAUMONT: What 's the problem ?
ORDELL: Well , it ai n't so much a problem a a situation . Remember I sold those three M-60 machine guns outta the five I got ?
BEAUMONT: Uh-huh .
ORDELL: I 'm gon na sell the other two tonight . This group of Koreans in Koreatown have started a Neighborhood Watch kinda thing . And they want a few weapons so the neighborhood niggas know they mean business . So I 'm gon na sell 'em my two machine guns tonight . Only problem , I aint never dealt with these Koreans before . Now I aint worried . Asians are by and large real dependable . They do n't want no trouble . You might argue about price , ut you aint got ta worry about them shootin ' you in the back . But I got me kind of a rule . Never do business with nobody you ai n't never done usiness with before without backup . That 's why I need you , backup .
BEAUMONT: Man , I ai n't ready to be goin ' out nowhere -
ORDELL: - Let me finish . Can I finish ?
BEAUMONT: Go ahead .
ORDELL: Now you 're gonn be in the trunk holding onto the shotgun . And I 'm going to tell them I 'm opening up my trunk to show 'em my goods . I open up the trunk , you pop up , rack that bad oy .
BEAUMONT: Fuck that shit , man . I ai n't shootin ' anybody .
ORDELL: What the fuck I tell you . You do n't hafta shoot nobody . Just hold the gun . They 'll get the idea .
BEAUMONT: I ai n't gittin ' in that trunk .
ORDELL: We 're only goin ' to Koreatown . You 'll e in there - ten minutes .
BEAUMONT: Uh-uh . I ai n't riding in that trunk no minutes . Why do n't I just ride with you ?
ORDELL: You ca n't ride with me . The surprise effect is ninety percent of it .
BEAUMONT: Well , I 'm sorry , man , but I ai n't gittin ' in that trunk .
ORDELL: I ca n't believe you do me this way .
BEAUMONT: I ai n't doin ' you no way . I just ai n't climbin ' in that trunk . I got a problem with small places .
ORDELL: Well , my ass has got a problem spending ten thousand dollars of my own goddam money to get ungrateful , peanut-head niggas outta jail , but I do it -
BEAUMONT: Look , man , I know I owe you -
ORDELL: - Well , if you owe me , git your ass in the trunk .
BEAUMONT: - I wan na help you , but I do n't wan na e locked in the trunk of no car .
ORDELL: You think I wanted to spend ten thousand dollars on your ass ?
BEAUMONT: Course you did n't .
ORDELL: But the only way to help you was to do that , so I did it . Okay , how 'bout this ? After we 're through fuckin ' with these Koreans , I take you to Roscoe 's Chicken and Waffles . My treat .
BEAUMONT: Now exactly how long I got ta be in this motherfucker .
ORDELL: Do n't worry . It 's just me .
LOUIS: Hello .
ORDELL: Louis , my man . Watcha doin ' ?
LOUIS: Oh , I dunno . Watching TV .
ORDELL: Whatcha watchin ' ?
LOUIS: Nothin ' really . Just kinda goin ' back and forth . They had some black girl from some black show on Jay Leno . I watched that for a bit , but I kept flippin channels cause I did n't know who she was .
ORDELL: Guess where I am ?
LOUIS: I dunno .
ORDELL: I know you do n't know . I said guess .
LOUIS: The moon - I dunno
ORDELL: I 'm talkin ' to you from the comfy- cozy interior of an Oldsmobile parked outside your nasty-ass welfare motel .
LOUIS: You 're outside ?
ORDELL: Uh-huh .
LOUIS: C'mon in .
ORDELL: Naw , man . I just told you , I 'm comfortable . I ai n't about to walk into that roach motel and get uncomfortable . You bring your ass out here .
LOUIS: I 'm in my underwear .
ORDELL: Then put your goddam drawers on , and get your ass out here . I got somethin ' to show you .
LOUIS: Who was that ?
ORDELL: That was Beaumont .
LOUIS: Who was Beaumont ?
ORDELL: An employee I had to let go .
LOUIS: What did he do ?
ORDELL: He put himself in a situation where he was gon na have to do ten years in the penetentiary , that 's what he did . And if you know Beaumont , you know there aint no way in hell he can do no ten years . And if you know that , you know Beaumont 's gon na go any goddam thing Beaumont can to keep from doin ' those ten years including telling the Federal government everything they want to know about my ass . Now that , my friend , is a clea case of him or me . And you best elieve it aint gon na be me . You know what I 'm sayin ' ? You gon na come in on this with me , you got ta be prepared to go all the way . I got me so fa over a half-a-million dollars sittin ' in lockboxes in a bank in Cabo San Lucas . Me and Mr. Walker make us one more delivery , I 'm gon na have me ove a million . You think I 'm gon na let this little cheese eatin ' nigga here fuck that up ? Shit , you better think again . 'Fore I let this deal get fucked up , I 'll shoot that nigga in the head , and ten niggas look just like em . Understand what I 'm sayin ' ?
LOUIS: Yeah .
ORDELL: So we on the same page then ?
LOUIS: I follow .
DARGUS: Hi , I 'm Detective Mark Dargus . L.A.P.D . can I ask what you have in that bag ?
JACKIE: The usual things . I 'm a flight attendant with Cabo Air .
NICOLET: Can I be of some assistance ?
JACKIE: I doubt it . Who 's your friend ?
DARGUS: This is Special Agent Ray Nicolet with Alcohol , Tobacco , and Firearms . Would you mind if we looked in that ag ?
JACKIE: Would I mind ? Do I have a choice ?
DARGUS: You have the right to say `` no . '' And I have the right to make you wait here with Ray while I go get a warrant . And if I do n't want to go through all that trouble , I could just take you in on suspicion .
JACKIE: Suspicion of what ?
NICOLET: All he wants to do is peek in you ag . I 'll watch he does n't take anything .
JACKIE: Go ahead .
DARGUS: I 'd say there 's about , oh , fifty thousand dollars here . What would you say Ray ?
NICOLET: That looks like fifty thousand dollars from here .
DARGUS: This is your money ?
JACKIE: If I were to tell you `` no it is n't ''
DARGUS: You should know if you bring in anything over ten thousand you have to declare it . You forgot or what ? You could get a two hundred and fifty thousand dollar fine , plus two years in prison . Now you want to talk to us about it , or you want to talk to Customs ?
JACKIE: I 'm not saying another word .
NICOLET: Listen , Jackie , Hope you do n't mind if I call you Jackie . They 're a bunch of fuckin ' pricks in Customs . Something about that job makes them kinda hard to get along with . Now , do you want to talk with a bunch of suspicious , disagreeable people like them , or a couple good-hearted guys like Mark and myself .
JACKIE: Arrest me .
DARGUS: You know , Miss Brown , there 's asically three types of people that we come along in the performance of our duty . One is , INNOCENT PEOPLE . Victims , witnesses , innocent ystanders You ai n't any of these . Then there 's two ; CRIMINALS . These sonabitches have dedicated thei lives to a life outside the law . That ai n't you either . Where you belong is the third category . The category we efer to as LOSERS .
JACKIE: I 'm not a loser .
DARGUS: Oh , you 're both ? In 1985 you were flying for TWA and got busted fo carrying drugs . You were carrying them for a pilot husband of yours . He did time and you got off . But that ended your career with the big airlines . Cut to thirteen years later . You 're forty-four years of age . You 're flying for the shittiest little shuttle-fucking piece of shit Mexican airline that there is . Where you make a whopping twelve-thousand dollars a year . That ai n't a hulluva lot to show for a twenty year career . And to top it off , you 're going to jail . Now true , the judge , even with your prior , will probably only give you a year or two . But this does n't seem like the time of life you got years to throw away . Now , we do n't like trying losers like they 're criminals . But in the absence of a criminal , we will try you . Now , was n't this money given to you by an American living in Mexico by the name of Cedric Walker ?
NICOLET: You know , ol ' Beaumont was n't much for talkin ' , either . Yeah , he told us about you and Mr. Walker , but whoeve the hell it was he worked for out here , he would n't say . Could it be the same person you were supposed to deliver this money to ?
DARGUS: I 'd like your permission to open this again . So we 'll know exactly how much money we 're talkin ' about here .
JACKIE: Help yourself .
DARGUS: While you 're at it , let me see what else is in there . You mind ?
JACKIE: My pocketbook .
DARGUS: What 's in it ?
JACKIE: Beauty products .
NICOLET: I 'll count the money .
DARGUS: What 's this ?
JACKIE: That 's my diet shit .
DARGUS: Let 's see what else is in there .
NICOLET: Oh , Miss Brown ?
JACKIE: Yeah ?
NICOLET: And what would this be , Sweet and Low ?
JACKIE: What the fuck is that shit ?
NICOLET: I know what it looks like .
JACKIE: You planted that shit on me .
NICOLET: It is n't enough for Trafficking , but how 'bout Posession with the Intent to Distribute ?
DARGUS: Oh , I would n't be so sure . What with all the cash , I think I could go with Conspiracy to Traffic .
JACKIE: I 'm tellin ' you , I do n't know nothin ' about that fuckin ' shit .
NICOLET: Well then , Miss Brown . Why do n't you have a seat and tell us who might know something about this fuckin ' shit .
DARGUS: If she 'll cooperate with us , we 'll turn possession with intent into plain ol ' Possession , and she can ond outta here for one thousand ucks . If she does n't help us , we 'll go for the Intent and request a twenty-five-thousand dollar bond .
JACKIE: You tell those guys they 'll have to do one helluva lot better than that efore I 'll even say 'hi ' to them .
PUBLIC DEFENDER: Well , that 's the State 's offer . If you plead to possession and tell L.A.P.D . what they want to know , you ond will be set at one-thousand dollars . If you do n't , L.A.P.D . will equest one at twenty- five thousand ased on your prior record and risk of flight . If you do n't post it o do n't know anyone who can , you 'll spend six to eight weeks in County efore your arraignment comes up .
JACKIE: Who 's side are you on ?
PUBLIC DEFENDER: I beg your pardon ?
JACKIE: What if I plead guilty ?
PUBLIC DEFENDER: And cooperate ? You might get probation .
JACKIE: If I do n't cooperate ?
PUBLIC DEFENDER: With the prior ? You could get anywhere from a year to five depending on the judge . You want to think about it ? You got two minutes efore we 're up .
JUDGE: Brown . Case number 700324 .
PUBLIC DEFENDER: She wishes to stand mute , your honor .
JUDGE: Very well Detective Dargus - You 're the arresting officer in his case , correct ?
DARGUS: That 's correct , your honor .
JUDGE: You have a recommendation for bail ?
DARGUS: Yes , I do , your honor . Based on the defendant 's prior conviction and the extreme possibility of flight due to her occupation , the State requests a ond of no less than twenty-five thousand .
JUDGE: I 'll set bond at ten thousand and set the date of August 14th for the arraignment .
JACKIE: When is that , your honor ?
JUDGE: That 's six weeks from now , Miss Brown . We 'll continue this matte then . Owens , case 72242 .
ORDELL: Unh unh unh I di n't hear you wash your hands .
MAX: Comfortable ?
ORDELL: The door was opened , so I just came ight in .
MAX: I can see that . Why ?
ORDELL: I got some more business for ya .
MAX: Oh , yeah ? What did he do ?
ORDELL: They fuckin ' wit ' her . They callin ' it Possession with Intent . A black woman in her forties gets busted with less than two ounces on her , they call that shit Intent . Same shit happened to a movie star . It 's Possession .
MAX: It still sounds high .
ORDELL: She had , I believe it was fifty grand on her , too . There was a cop at the hearing . Young guy with L.A.P.D . wanted her bond set at twenty-five thousand , saying there was a risk of flight . Jackie being a stewardess and all .
MAX: Before we start talking about stewardess , let 's get Beaumont out of the way first .
ORDELL: Somebody already did .
MAX: What ?
ORDELL: You did n't hear ?
MAX: Hear what ?
ORDELL: Somebody with a grudge blew Beaumont 's brains out - hey , that hymes - blew Beaumont 's brains out .
MAX: Did the police contact you ?
ORDELL: Very first motherfuckin ' thing they did . They see I put up a big money ond on my boy , they start thinking with that where-there's-smoke-there 's fire logic . They roust my ass outta ed , ten o'clock in the morning . Fuckin ' scare my woman , Sherona , half to death . She thought they were gon na take my ass away for sure .
MAX: The stewardess . Do you know her last name ?
ORDELL: Brown , Jackie Brown .
MAX: What does she do for you ?
ORDELL: Who says she does anything for me ? She 's my friend . When my friends get into trouble , I like to help 'em out .
MAX: Beaumont worked for you .
ORDELL: That 's what the police thought . I told them I 'm unemployed , how could I have anybody work for me ? Now I bail out Jackie , I 'm liable to have the police on me again , huh ? Wanting to know was she doing things for me , was she bringing me that money !
MAX: Was she ?
ORDELL: Is this , me and you , like a lawyer- client relationship ? The lawyer ca n't tell nothing he hears ?
MAX: You 're not my client until you get usted and I bond you out .
ORDELL: If there 's no - what do you call it - confidentiality between us ? Why would I tell you anything ?
MAX: Cause you want me to know what a slick guy you are . You got stewardesses bringing you fifty grand .
ORDELL: Why would a stewardess bring me fifty grand ?
MAX: You want me to speculate on what you do . I 'd say you 're in the drug usiness , except the money 's moving in the wrong direction . Whateve you 're into , you seem to be getting away with it , so more power to you . Okay you want another bond , and you want to move over the ten thousand you put down on Beaumont to the stewardess . That means paperwork . I have to get a death certificate , present it to the court , fill out a eceipt for return of bond collateral , then type up anothe application . An indemnity agreement -
ORDELL: - Jackie aint got time for all that shit -
MAX: - I 'm telling you what I have to do . What you have to do , in case you forgot , is come up with premium of a thousand bucks .
ORDELL: I got it . I just do n't got it on me .
MAX: Well , come back when you do , and I 'll ond out the stewardess .
ORDELL: Man , you know I 'm good for it . Thousand bucks ai n't shit .
MAX: If I do n't see it in front of me , you 're right . It ai n't shit .
ORDELL: Man , you need to look at this with a little compassion . Jackie ai n't no criminal . She ai n't used to this kinda treatment . I mean , gangsters do n't give a fuck - but for the average citizen , coupla nights in County fuck with your mind .
MAX: Ordell , this is n't a bar , an you do n't have a tab .
ORDELL: Just listen for a second . We got a forty-year-old , gainfully employed lack woman , falsely accused -
MAX: Falsely accused ? She did n't come back from Mexico with cocaine on her ?
ORDELL: Falsely accused of Intent . If she had that shit - and mind you , I said `` if '' - it was just her shit to get high with .
MAX: Is white guilt supposed to make me forget I 'm running a business ?
ORDELL: Okay , man . I got your money . But do n't you ever ask me for no fuckin ' favor .
MAX: Tomorrow I 'll talk to your probation officer . Karen 's a good kid , but she 's mad at you , because you lied to her . This business about you grandmother 's funeral
ANITA: I went . I did . I took my mother and little brother .
MAX: But you did n't ask permission . You oke a trust . If you had asked , Karen probably would have let you . I 'm sure she would .
ANITA: I know . That 's why I went .
MAX: But then you told her you were home .
ANITA: Sure , 'cause I did n't ask her if I could go .
MAX: I do n't know . Maybe it 's a language problem . Anita , you ever cause this much heartache over something that could easily be avoided , I 'll never write you again . You understand ?
ANITA: I understand .
MAX: I mean it . I do n't care how many times your mother calls or how much she cries .
ANITA: I understand .
MAX: Then say `` Yes , Max . I understand . ''
ANITA: Yes , Max , I understand .
MAX: Dropping off and picking up . Dropping of Lopez , Anita . Picking up Brown , Jackie .
ANITA: So you 're gon na call Karen tomorrow ?
MAX: I 'll call her .
ANITA: Wo n't forget ?
MAX: I wo n't forget .
ANITA: Thanks , Max . See you later .
JACKIE: Okay .
MAX: Who do you think I am ?
JACKIE: Can I see your I.D . ?
MAX: You 're serious ?
JACKIE: Who put up my bond ? Ordell ?
MAX: In cash .
JACKIE: Can we stop for cigarettes ?
MAX: Sure , ever been to the Riverbottom ?
JACKIE: I do n't think so .
MAX: It 's okay . It 's a cop hangout .
JACKIE: Could n't we just stop at a seven- eleven ?
MAX: I thought you might want a drink ?
JACKIE: I 'd love one , but not there .
MAX: We could stop at the Hilton by the airport .
JACKIE: Is it dark ?
MAX: It 's kind of a sports ba
JACKIE: That does n't sound dark .
MAX: Why does it need to be dark ?
JACKIE: 'Cause I look like I just got outta jail , that 's why . You droppin ' me off at home , right ? There 's a place by me .
MAX: Great .
JACKIE: You gain weight ?
MAX: Ten pounds . I lose it and put it back on .
JACKIE: That 's why I do n't quit . If I ca n't fly anymore , I 'm gon na have a bitch of a time gettin ' my brand .
MAX: What 's your brand ?
JACKIE: Davidoffs . I get 'em in Mexico . They 're hard to find here . I was locked up with the last two getting legal advice from a woman who was in for bustin ' her boyfriend 's head open with a baseball bat .
MAX: Was she helpful ?
JACKIE: She was more helpful than the fuckin ' Public Defender . I do n't know - I guess what I need is a lawyer , find out what my options are .
MAX: You know , I figured out the other day I 've written something like ' fifteen thousand bonds since I 've been in the usiness . I 'd say about eighty percent of them were at least drug elated . If you want , I can help you look at your options .
JACKIE: You 're not tired of it ?
MAX: I am , as a matter of fact .
JACKIE: So far I 've been told I can cooperate and get probation , maybe . Or , I can stand mute and get as much as five years . Does that sound right ?
MAX: I 'd say if you 're tried and found guilty you wo n't get more than a yea and a day . That 's State time . Prison .
JACKIE: Shit .
MAX: But they wo n't want to take you to trial . They 'll offer you simple Possession , a few months of County time , and a year or two probation . How 'bout another ?
JACKIE: Sure .
MAX: You know who put the dope in you ag ?
JACKIE: Yeah , but that 's not what this was about . They were fuckin waitin ' fo my ass . They knew I had that money , they even knew the amount . The one who searched my bag , from L.A.P.D. , Dargus , hardly even looked at it . `` Oh , I 'd say there 's fifty thousand here . What would you say ? '' But all they could do was threaten me and hand me over to Customs , and I could tell they did n't want to do that .
MAX: They wanted you to tell them what you know .
JACKIE: I had 'em too . I burnt those two Starky and Hutch motherfuckers down . Then their asses lucked out and found that coke .
MAX: What did they want to know ?
JACKIE: Who gave me the money and who I was giving it to . And some guy they found in a trunk with his head blown off . Said it was him who told them 'bout me .
ROWEN: Can I get you two some popcorn ?
MAX: No , thanks .
JACKIE: That 's him . How do you know 'em ?
MAX: I wrote him on Monday . They found him dead on Tuesday .
JACKIE: Ordell pick up his bond ?
MAX: Same as you . Ten thousand .
JACKIE: The federal agent kinda half hinted Ordell might of done Beaumont .
MAX: You mentioned a guy from L.A.P.D. , ut you did n't mention the Federal .
JACKIE: I did n't ?
MAX: No , you did n't . What branch ?
JACKIE: Ray Nicolet with Alcohol , Tobacco , and Firearms .
MAX: He 's the one who wants you .
JACKIE: It was the other guy who busted me .
MAX: 'Cause if he busted you , you 'd play hell bonding out of federal court . He does n't want you mad at him , he wants you to tell him what you know . He uses you to get a line on Ordell , make a case , then take him federal . You know what Ordell 's into ?
JACKIE: I have a pretty good idea . Ordell aint no bootlegger and I doubt he 's smugglin ' Cuban cigars . So that only leaves one thing an A.T.F . man would e interested in .
MAX: How many trips did you make ?
JACKIE: With ten thousand ? Nine .
MAX: He 's got that kinda money ?
JACKIE: It 's all in lock boxes in a Mexico ank . But he 's got a problem . He 's - what do you call it when you got money , but do n't have cash ?
MAX: Cash poor ?
JACKIE: That 's it . He 's cash poor . He kept on me till I finally said okay . I 'll ing whatever fits in a nine-by- twelve envelope . I got paid five hundred dollars , and his friend , Mr. Walker , in Mexico gave me the envelope .
MAX: If you knew bringing anything ove ten thousand was against the law , why not pack a hundred grand ?
JACKIE: Whatever it was had to fit in my bag and not hit you in the face if the ag was opened . This ai n't solvin ' my problem . I got ta figure out a way to either keep my job or get out of trouble . I 'm of today , but if I ca n't leave the country I 'm out of a job . And if I do n't got a job , I ca n't hire a lawyer .
MAX: Ask A.T.F . They might give you permission .
JACKIE: Yeah , if I cooperate .
MAX: Well , Jackie , you got caught , you 're gon na have to give 'em something .
JACKIE: But if all I can give 'em is Ordell 's name - I do n't really know shit about what he does or how he does it - That do n't give me much to bargain with .
MAX: Give 'em what you got . Offer to help . Show a willingness to be helpful . You want to stay out of jail , do n't you ?
JACKIE: I think maybe I have more options than I thought .
JACKIE: I was expecting you . Come in .
ORDELL: You got some booze ?
JACKIE: I got some vodka in the freezer .
ORDELL: Got some o.j . ?
JACKIE: Yeah .
ORDELL: Well , then , why do n't you be a good hostess and make me a screwdriver ?
JACKIE: Sure .
ORDELL: You gon na thank me ?
JACKIE: For what ?
ORDELL: Who you think got your ass outta jail ?
JACKIE: The same guy who put me in , thanks a lot .
ORDELL: Hey , you get caught with blow , that 's our business .
JACKIE: It was n't mine .
ORDELL: Oh , shit . I bet it was that present Mr. Walker was sending Melanie . Yaaaah , he 's the one musta put it in there if you did n't . Oh , man , that shit 's uncalled for , baby , and I apologize . I 'magine they asked you a shitload of questions about it , huh ? All that money , want to know where you got it ?
JACKIE: They asked .
ORDELL: And what was your answer ?
JACKIE: I said I wanted to talk to a lawyer .
ORDELL: You positive about that ? You were n't nervous and let something slip by mistake ? If you did , I ai n't mad , I just got ta know .
JACKIE: You 're not asking the right questions .
ORDELL: I knew it .
JACKIE: And they asked if I knew Mr. Walker .
ORDELL: Yeah ?
JACKIE: I did n't tell 'em anything .
ORDELL: My name come up ?
JACKIE: They told me .
ORDELL: Yeah , somebody musta been real mad at Beaumont . Or they were afraid of what he might say to keep from doin some time . I'magine from time-to-time they asked you a whole shitload of questions . And you did n't give 'em no answer ?
MAX: Where is it ?
ORDELL: Is that what I think it is ?
JACKIE: What do you think it is ?
ORDELL: I think it 's a gun pressing against my dick .
JACKIE: You thought right Now take you hands from around my throat , nigga .
ORDELL: What the hell you doin ' ?
JACKIE: Shut your ass up and grab the wall !
ORDELL: Now , baby , that 's got nothin ' to do with you . I just carry that . You been listenin ' to them cops too much .
JACKIE: The cops did n't try and strangle my ass .
ORDELL: Damn , Jackie , I was just playin ' with you .
JACKIE: Well , I ai n't playin with you . I 'm gon na unload both these motherfuckers , you do n't do what I tell you . Understand what I 'm saying ?
ORDELL: Baby , I ai n't come here -
JACKIE: I said , you understand what I 'm saying
ORDELL: I understand woman , damn !
JACKIE: Go sit over in that chair .
ORDELL: I 'm tellin ' you , those cops been fuckin ' wit your mind . They turn lack against black , that 's how they do .
JACKIE: Shut your raggedy ass up and sit down .
ORDELL: This shits gettin silly now
JACKIE: I got ta tell you to shut up one more time , I 'm gon na shut you up .
ORDELL: I just came here to talk .
JACKIE: Way I see it , me and you only got one thing to talk about . What you willing to do for me ?
ORDELL: Well , I can get you a good lawyer -
JACKIE: Let 's get realistic , baby . Sooner o later they 're gon na get around to offering me a plea deal , and you know that . That 's why you came here to kill me .
ORDELL: - Baby , I did n't -
JACKIE: - It 's okay . I forgive you . Now , let 's say if I tell on you , I walk . And if I do n't , I go to jail .
ORDELL: Yeah ?
JACKIE: One hundred thousand put in an escrow account in my name , if I 'm convicted up to a year , or put on probation . If I have to do more than a year , you pay another hundred thousand .
ORDELL: I got a problem
JACKIE: All your money 's in Mexico .
ORDELL: Yeah .
JACKIE: I been thinkin about that , too , and I got me a idea .
JACKIE: I 'll talk to the cops tomorrow and tell you if it 's on .
JACKIE: You want your gun , do n't you ? Come in . I 'll go get it .
MAX: If you 're having some .
JACKIE: I am . Have a seat .
MAX: You get a chance to use it ?
JACKIE: I felt a lot safer having it . My milk went bad when I was in jail .
MAX: Black 's fine .
JACKIE: Thanks , but I have my own now .
MAX: You went out this morning and bought a gun ?
JACKIE: What , I could n't hear you ?
MAX: You went out this morning and bought a gun .
JACKIE: Let 's just say I got one , okay ?
MAX: Somebody loan it to you ?
JACKIE: Yeah .
MAX: Sure .
JACKIE: I could n't wait till I got home last night and wash my hair .
MAX: It looks nice .
JACKIE: I got a few . But I ca n't afford to start all over again . I got too much time and money invested in my ecords .
MAX: Yeah , but you ca n't get new stuff on ecords .
JACKIE: I do n't buy new stuff that often .
MAX: This is pretty .
JACKIE: Uh-huh .
MAX: Who is this ?
JACKIE: The Delfonics .
MAX: '76 ?
JACKIE: '74 , I think .
MAX: It 's nice .
JACKIE: I called in sick this morning . As fa as the airline knows , I 'm still available .
MAX: Are you ?
JACKIE: I do n't know yet . 'm going to talk with Dargus and Nicolet today . Do what you suggested . Offer to help and see what happens .
MAX: What I meant was have a lawyer do the negotiating for you .
JACKIE: I want to talk to them first . I know more now about Ordell 's money .
MAX: Well , if the A.T.F . guy is the one who wants you , that 'll only interest him up to a point .
JACKIE: It 's a lot of money . About a half-a- million dollars . All of it in Cabo in safe deposit boxes and more comin in .
MAX: How 'd you find that out ?
JACKIE: He told me last night .
MAX: He called you ?
JACKIE: He came by .
MAX: What ? What 'd you do ?
JACKIE: We talked .
MAX: Why ?
JACKIE: He needs me . Without me all that money is just gon na sit over there in Cabo . Sugar ?
MAX: No thanks . There 's got ta be othe ways to get it out .
JACKIE: Maybe , but 'm the only one he 's eve used . He ca n't trust his othe people . They 're crooks . He can try inging I in himself , but Ordell sure do n't want to go through no Customs line . Either he recruits another Cabo stewardess , or he continues to trust me . I made him feel he still can .
MAX: How do you get it out ?
JACKIE: Same way I been don ' , but first they got to let me go back to work .
MAX: You 're gon na offer to set him up ?
JACKIE: If I get let off . Otherwise , fuck 'em .
MAX: It 's very possible Ordell 's killed somebody .
JACKIE: I ai n't goin ' to jail , and I ai n't doin ' that probation thing again .
MAX: You 're not old . You look great .
JACKIE: I 'm asking how you feel . Does it other you ?
MAX: It 's not really something I think about .
JACKIE: Really ?
MAX: Okay , I 'm a little sensitive about my hair . It started falling out ten years ago . So I did something about it .
JACKIE: How 'd you feel about it ?
MAX: I 'm fine with it , or I would n't of done it , I did it to feel bette about myself , and I do . When I look in the mirror it looks like me .
JACKIE: It 's different with men .
MAX: You know , I ca n't really feel too sorry for you in that department .
JACKIE: My ass ai n't the same .
MAX: Bigger ?
JACKIE: Yeah .
MAX: Nothin wrong with that .
JACKIE: I just feel like I 'm always starting over . You said how many bonds you wrote ?
MAX: Fifteen thousand .
JACKIE: Well , I 've flown seven million miles . And I 've been waitin ' on people almost twenty years . The best job I could get after my bust was Cabo Air , which is about the worst job you can get in this industry . I make about sixteen thousand , with retirement enefits , ai n't worth a damn . And now with this arrest hanging over my head , I 'm scared . If I lose my job I got ta start all over again , but I got nothin to start over with . I 'll be stuck with whatever I can get . And that scares me more than Ordell .
NICOLET: Hey , Jackie .
DARGUS: Let me have a word outside with Agent Nicolet for a moment ?
JACKIE: Take your time .
DARGUS: Thanks .
NICOLET: Well just be a minute .
JACKIE: Can I smoke ?
DARGUS: Go ahead .
NICOLET: What 's going on ?
DARGUS: She wants to make a deal .
NICOLET: She sound scared ?
DARGUS: She almost sounds scared .
NICOLET: What 's she want ?
DARGUS: She wants to go back to work .
NICOLET: What 's she willing to give us ?
DARGUS: She has n't one into specifics yet , she 's been waiting for you .
NICOLET: She knows it 's my case ?
DARGUS: She ai n't said it , but she 's not stupid , she knows it 's you who wants her .
NICOLET: Thanks for waiting , Jackie . Now tell me , what can we do for you ?
JACKIE: I need permission to leave the country so I keep my job .
NICOLET: We can look into that .
JACKIE: I need it tomorrow . If I do n't show up for work tomorrow , I 'm fired .
NICOLET: You know what we want .
JACKIE: If I 'm working , I can help you .
DARGUS: Help us do what ?
JACKIE: Help you get Ordell Robbie .
NICOLET: Oh , so now you know him ?
JACKIE: You never asked me if I did or not .
DARGUS: But now you 're telling us now you do .
JACKIE: 'Course I do - I deliver money fo him .
NICOLET: No shit . You know how he makes hi money ?
JACKIE: He sells guns .
NICOLET: You ever see him sell guns ?
JACKIE: No .
NICOLET: Then how do you know he sells guns ?
JACKIE: He told me . Besides , why else would an A.T.F . man be after him ?
NICOLET: How can you help us ?
JACKIE: Short of wearing a wire , I 'll do everything I can to help you throw his ass in jail . And in exchange fo my help , I need permission to leave the country and immunity .
DARGUS: You do n't want much , do you ?
JACKIE: Can you do it or not ?
DARGUS: It 's your call .
NICOLE: It 's possible .
ORDELL: We 're back .
MELANIE: 'Ola !
ORDELL: We been shoppin ' . Ca n't have my boy unning around lookin ' like a bum on the street .
LOUIS: I did n't look like a bum .
ORDELL: But you did have a Salvation Army- thing going .
MELANIE: It 's that late ?
ORDELL: Ha-ha-ha . I 'm serious , you smoke too much of that shit . That shit robs you of your ambition .
MELANIE: Not if your ambition is to get high and watch TV .
ORDELL: You two a coupla Cheech and Chongs , ai n't ya . Oh , that 's okay , I 'll get it .
MELANIE: I was gon na tell you
ORDELL: No , not on the phone , let 's meet somewhere . But you got ta make sure they ai n't followin ' you
LOUIS: Is it ready to go ?
MELANIE: Yeah , there 's another hit left .
JACKIE: The Cockatoo Inn .
ORDELL: The Cockatoo Inn ? Where 's that ?
JACKIE: It 's right on Hawthorne Boulevard and Manhattan Beach Boulevard . It 's red ick
ORDELL: Oh , wait , you mean that place that has the big sign with a rooster on it ?
JACKIE: It 's a cockatoo .
MELANIE: You okay ?
LOUIS: Yeah , I 'm just gettin ' old . I ca n't smoke or laugh now it seems without coughing .
MELANIE: Coughing opens up the capillaries . When you cough , you 're getting air - in this case smoke - to parts of the lung that do n't normally get used . Coughing 's good - gets ya higher . My dad coughs when he smokes all the time .
ORDELL: Hey , Louis , I have to go out awhile . So since you like gettin ' high so much , why do n't you stay here with Melanie , get high , and watch cartoons ?
LOUIS: Way ahead of you .
ORDELL: So you just watch this for the next three hours , and I 'll be back . Then , when I 'm through with all my usiness , I 'll get high . I get high at night . Walk me to the door , space girl .
MELANIE: No problem .
ORDELL: Try not to rip his clothes off 'em they 're new .
MELANIE: Want a Metrix ?
LOUIS: What 's a Metrix ?
MELANIE: It 's like this major meal in a shake you drink instead of having a big meal .
LOUIS: It 's a diet thing ?
MELANIE: No , it 's what body builders drink to eef up .
LOUIS: No thanks .
MELANIE: Which one ?
LOUIS: The roller disco one .
MELANIE: Fourteen .
LOUIS: You 're fourteen years old here ?
MELANIE: Yeah .
LOUIS: I thought you were sixteen .
MELANIE: I was pretty much the same height now as I was then .
LOUIS: Were you a disco girl ?
MELANIE: Noooo , I was a surfer girl . Besides , I was only fourteen . I could n't go to discos .
LOUIS: So where did you go ?
MELANIE: The beach . Or get high , drop acid at a friend 's place . I was a K.L.O.S . girl . I hated disco .
LOUIS: No .
MELANIE: Where were you ?
LOUIS: Detroit .
MELANIE: With Ordell ?
LOUIS: We had done time together already .
MELANIE: Were you a disco guy ?
LOUIS: No .
MELANIE: C'mon , do n't lie .
LOUIS: I do n't like dancing .
MELANIE: Did you ever go I one ?
LOUIS: I went to a few just to meet women . But I do n't like to dance , and it 's so fuckin ; loud . During that whole scene I just drank in bars . Who did n't make the cut ?
MELANIE: That 's a picture of me in Japan .
LOUIS: You been to Japan ?
MELANIE: I lived there for about nine months .
LOUIS: You lived in Japan , when ?
MELANIE: About five years ago .
LOUIS: Who 's arm is that ?
MELANIE: That 's the guy I lived with his name was Hir.Hirosh .
LOUIS: Must of made quite an impression .
MEALINE: I never got to know him , really . I could n't speak Japanese , and his English was terrible . But I could n't say anything , because his English was etter than my Japanese .
LOUIS: That sounds like a problem .
MELANIE: Not really . We did n't have much to say to each other anyway . I never got to know him that well , but I knew enough to know I was n't missing much . I keep that , because of all the fuckin ' time I was there , that 's the only picture I got of me in Japan . That 's Japan .
LOUIS: Sure .
MELANIE: That was fun .
LOUIS: Yeah , that really hit the spot .
ORDELL: I got ta remember this place . This is all right . Two minutes from you crib , ten minutes from your work . Not ad
FLOYD: What 's your drink , brother ?
ORDELL: Screwdriver .
FLOYD: How you doin ' ?
JACKIE: I 'm fine .
FLOYD: Yes , you are .
ORDELL: I bet you come here on a Saturday night , you need nigga repellent keep 'em off your ass .
JACKIE: I do okay .
ORDELL: You a fine lookin ' woman , Jackie . I et you do a damn sight better than okay . You think anybody followed you ?
JACKIE: I do n't think so , but it do n't really matter . They know I 'm meeting you .
ORDELL: How the fuck they know that ?
JACKIE: I told them .
FLOYD: Three twenty-five .
ORDELL: Keep it .
FLOYD: Thank you , sir .
ORDELL: You told em ? You told em it 's me ?
JACKIE: They already know it 's you .
ORDELL: Well , shit . That do n't mean you got ta confirm it !
JACKIE: Look , the only way I can get permission to fly is if I agree to help them . Which is what I have to appear to be doing . So I give them something they already know . You .
ORDELL: Didja tell 'em anything else ?
JACKIE: I told them you got a half a million dollars in Mexico , and you want me to ing it here .
ORDELL: You told them that ?
JACKIE: It 's true , is n't it ?
ORDELL: What the fuck 's that got to do with it ?
JACKIE: They know I 'm delivering for you . I mention the half-million - they do n't give a fuck about that - They want you with guns . So I say , well , if you want proof he 's getting paid fo selling them , let me bring the money in .
ORDELL: What did they say ?
JACKIE: Yes .
MELANI: so first he tries to get into the cocaine business but realizes right away that shit 's too competitive . Piss the wrong person off , you get shot . So he says , fuck that - moves over to guns . You can sell guns wherever there 's a demand . No one gives a shit . He acts like he 's this ig international arms dealer , when , come on , the only people he ever sold to were dopers .
LOUIS: He seems to be making out .
MELANIE: Is it dead ?
LOUIS: Yeah .
MELANIE: Well , so far he is . But you have to admit he 's not too bright .
LOUIS: I would n't go so far as to say that .
MELANIE: He moves his lips when he reads , what does that tell ya . Let 's say he 's streetwise . I 'll give 'im that . He 's still a fuck-up .
LOUIS: So what are you trying to tell me ? I should get out of here ?
MELANIE: That 's not what I 'm saying at all . You know where he went ?
LOUIS: No .
MELANIE: He went to meet that stewardess .
LOUIS: Does that bother you ?
MELANIE: Please .
LOUIS: You live with him .
MELANIE: I live here . He drops in and out . He tell you about that half-million dollars he 's got in Mexico ?
LOUIS: Uh-huh ?
MELANIE: Course he did , he tells everybody who 'll listen . That 's what he 's doin ' with this stewardess . He 's scheming how he can get it over here .
LOUIS: And your point is ?
MELANIE: Let him and that stewardess get that money over here
LOUIS: Uh-huh ?
MELANI: and just take it from him .
JACKI: I make two deliveries . The first one with ten thousand , like a dry un . They watch it . See how it works . Then we do a second delivery , when I ing in the half mill .
ORDELL: Naw , naw , that 's too much exposure . I ai n't goin anywhere near that money .
JACKIE: You do n't have to . I told 'em you 're eal careful . You never pick up money yourself . You always send someone , and I never know who it is .
ORDELL: That 's a good idea .
JACKIE: If you just listen , you 'll see it 's a damn good idea . The first time I do it they 're lurking about . They see me hand the ten thousand to someone .
ORDELL: Who ?
JACKIE: I do n't know . One of your friends .
ORDELL: A woman .
JACKIE: If you want .
ORDELL: Yeah , I think a woman .
JACKIE: The next trip , when I come with all the money , it 'll look like I hand it to the same one I did before
ORDELL: But you do n't ?
JACKIE: No , I give it to someone else first .
ORDELL: And they follow the wrong one thinkin ' she 's bringing it to me .
JACKIE: That 's the idea .
ORDELL: So we need two people , two women .
JACKIE: Can you cover that ?
ORDELL: I got the woman covered . Where you thinkin ' about doin ' this ?
JACKIE: I was thinkin ' the Del Amo Mall . In the food court .
ORDELL: I suppose you see a piece of this fo yourself ?
JACKIE: Well , it 's my plan . We 're in this together .
ORDELL: Yeah , but it 's my money , and I do n't need me a partner .
JACKIE: I ai n't your partner , I 'm you manager . I 'm managing to get you money out of Mexico , into America , in your hands , and I 'm managing to do all this under the nose of the cops . That makes me your manager , and managers get fifteen percent .
ORDELL: Managers get ten percent .
JACKIE: That 's an agent . Manager 's get fifteen percent .
ORDELL: I 'll give ya ten .
JACKIE: Plus the same deal as before .
ORDELL: I can do that .
JACKIE: The money 's in a Broadway shopping ag . I get some food , and sit down here in the food court . Then you girl comes - you got somebody yet ?
ORDELL: Uh-huh .
JACKIE: Who ?
ORDELL: What 'd you care ?
JACKIE: Look , it 's my ass facin ' the penitentiary . You send some hard- headed roc whore , and she fucks things up .
ORDELL: I ai n't gon na send no roc whore . The woman 's cool , I promise .
JACKIE: Do n't forget your bag .
MAX: walks into the food court . He stands looking a all the international fast food choices in front of him . As he tries to decide , he hears from behind him ;
JACKIE: Surprise .
MAX: I walked right past you .
JACKIE: I know , ignoring me . What 're you up to ?
MAX: Catching a movie .
JACKIE: What 'd ya see ?
MAX: `` American Prseident ''
JACKIE: How was it ?
MAX: Pretty good . Me and Annette Bening are goin steady .
JACKIE: Oh , are you ? Does she know that ?
MAX: No I do n't believe she 's ever heard of me . But that does n't mean we 're not going steady .
ORDELL: What 's up with this shit .
MAX: I think falling in live with movie stars is something that happens to a man as he gets older .
JACKIE: Does it happen to all men ?
MAX: Well , I 'd never be so bold as to speak for all men , but as or myself and a few of my friends , that 's definitely the case . There 's a lot of actresses out there you like , and there 's some you have crushes on . But there 's always one who you love . And with her it 's sorta like going steady .
JACKIE: And Annette 's it for you ?
MAX: For now . These relationships neve last too long .
JACKIE: That 's a goddam man for ya . Ca n't even be faithful to a fuckin ' movie star .
MAX: Sandra Bullock . You know her ?
JACKIE: Yeah , she 's the girl who drove the us in `` Speed . '' She 's cute .
MAX: She 's adorable . But I had to end it .
JACKIE: Why ?
MAX: I 'm old enough to be her father .
JACKIE: How old 's Annette ?
MAX: I do n't care .
JACKIE: I go back to work tomorrow .
MAX: You talk them into it ?
JACKIE: They seem to like the idea .
MAX: Bring the money in and they follow it ?
JACKIE: Yea , but I 'm going to dress it up . Put the money in a shopping bag and hand it to someone I meet here .
MAX: You do n't actually do it that way ?
JACKIE: He always just picked it up at my place . But with A.T.F . involved , I want to stage it . You know , make it look more intriguing , like we know what the fuck we 're doin ' . Then it 's up to Ray Nicolet , the A.T. F. guy to follow the shopping bag .
MAX: Make the delivery somewhere in the mall .
JACKIE: Right around here , in the food court .
MAX: Sit down , leave the bag under the table ?
JACKIE: I 'm helping him bring his money into America . He loves the idea . You just missed him .
MAX: He was here ?
JACKIE: Yeah , we were goin ' over everything . That 's why all the bags .
MAX: I called you last night .
JACKIE: I know , I got your message . Ray wanted to have dinner . He wanted to talk about the sting we 're plotting . That 's what he calls it . A sting . He 's being real nice to me .
MAX: You think he 's got a thing for you ?
JACKIE: Maybe . But I 'm thinking it might be something like he wants the money fo himself .
MAX: I do n't follow your logic . What does his being nice to you have to do with him wanting Ordell 's money ?
JACKIE: He 's setting me up to make a proposition .
MAX: I see .
JACKIE: You do n't propose something like that unless you 're pretty sure the othe person 's into it .
MAX: Has he hinted around ?
JACKIE: Not really . But I knew this narcotics cop one time . Told me that in a raid , the whole package never gets back to the station . His exact words .
MAX: You know some interesting people .
JACKIE: We were n't bullshittin ' either , 'cause later he was suspended and forced to retire .
MAX: Has Nicolet told you any colorful stories like that ?
JACKIE: He tries to act cool .
MAX: No harm in that . He 's a young guy havin ' fun being a cop . I know the type , trust me on this . He 's more interested in Ordell than the money . If he 's gon na do anything suspect , it 'll be cutting corners to get the conviction ; but he would n't walk off with the money . It 's evidence .
JACKIE: What about you Max ?
MAX: What ? If I was in Nicolet 's place ?
JACKIE: No , I mean you , right now . Not it you were somebody else .
MAX: If I saw a way to walk off with a shopping bag full of money , would I take it ?
JACKIE: You know where it came from . It 's not like it 's anybody 's life savings . It would n't even be missed .
MAX: A half-a-million dollars will always e missed .
JACKIE: You 're avoiding the question .
MAX: Okay , sure . I might be tempted . Especially now , since I 'm getting out of the bail bonds business .
JACKIE: Why ?
MAX: A lot of reasons . But the main one would be I 'm tired of it .
JACKIE: When did you decide ?
MAX: It 's been a long time coming . I finally made up my mind - I guess it was Thursday .
JACKIE: The day you got me out of jail ?
MAX: Yeah , that night I went to pick up a guy . I hear he 's staying at this house , so I sneak in , wait for him to come home .
JACKIE: Wait a minute . After we were togethe you went and snuck into a guy 's house ?
MAX: Uh-huh .
MAX: And went to this guy 's house in El Monte , and I waited for him .
JACKIE: What do you do when he comes home ?
MAX: Shoot him with the stun gun . While he 's incapacitated , cuff him , take 'em to County .
JACKIE: You do that ?
MAX: That 's my job .
JACKIE: Did you do it that night ?
MAX: He never came home . But I 'm sitting on the couch , in the dark , holding my stun gun and the whole house smells of mildew - So after a couple hours I think , `` What am I doing here ? Nineteen years of this shit ? So I made up my mind , that 's it .
JACKIE: And is that it ?
MAX: More or less .
JACKIE: I 'm not sure you answered my question .
MAX: Which one ?
JACKIE: If you had a chance , unemployed now , to walk off with a half-million dollars , would you take it ?
MAX: I believe I said I 'd be tempted .
JACKIE: What if I 've figured a way ?
JACKIE: Bye bye Bye now Goodbye Bye ye Bye bye Goodbye
NICOLET: We got ta stop meeting this way .
DARGUS: How was your flight ?
JACKIE: Fine .
DARGUS: Bet you 're happy to be working again .

JACKIE: I thought you were going to let this one through .
DARGUS: We are . Do n't worry about it .
NICOLET: Every step of this goes in my report . I am now taking a manila envelope from the subject 's flight bag .
DARGUS: What time do you have to be there ?
JACKIE: Four thirty . I 'm meeting a woman .
DARGUS: What 's her name ?
JACKIE: He would n't say . You gon na follow her ?
DARGUS: She leaves , somebody 'll be on her .
JACKIE: But you 're not going to stop her ?
NICOLET: The envelope contains ten thousand dollars . The subject will be delivering the currency in a
JACKIE: A Broadway shopping bag .
NICOLET: A Broadway shopping bag . A large bag with handles and brown lettering .
MAX: CafŠ mocha .
JACKIE: Think of it as money that should n't even be here . I mean does anybody have a right to it ?
MAX: The feds . It 's evidence .
JACKIE: It may be evidence once they get their hands on it , but right now it 's only money .
YOUNG GIRL: Yes 'm .
JACKIE: Put your bag on the floor , okay ? Under the table , right next to mine .
YOUNG GIRL: Sherona ?
JACKIE: Go ahead , start eating .
SHERONDA: He say we like the same thing as married .
JACKIE: Do you live together ?
SHERONDA: Most of the times .
JACKIE: Not every day ?
SHERONDA: Sometimes every day , for a while .
JACKIE: Then you do n't see him for a few days ?
SHERONDA: Yes 'm .
JACKIE: You know what 's in the bag you 're taking ?
SHERONDA: He say is a surprise .
JACKIE: Well , Sheronda , it was nice talking to you .
MAX: You 're rationalizing .
JACKIE: That 's what you do to go through with the shit you start . You rationalize . I can do this , Max , I know I can . But I ca n't do it without you .
MAX: It could work If she handles the cops right , I could work
ORDELL: Check this out .
LOUIS: How much is there ?
ORDELL: Over half-million dollars worth of merchandise .
LOUIS: Can I ask you about Melanie ?
ORDELL: Sure .
LOUIS: What 's your relationship ?
ORDELL: She one of the women I got set up . I got Melanie in Hermosa Beach . I rent Simone a small house in Compton , and about four blocks away I got me this nineteen-year-old country girl named Sheronda . I found her waitin ' for a us two days outta Alabama , barefoot , country as a chicken coop . Took he to my house in Compton , told her it was Hollywood .
LOUIS: She believed you ?
ORDELL: Hell , yeah . To her dumb country ass , Compton is Hollywood . Close as she 's ever been , anyway .
LOUIS: Do you trust Melanie ?
ORDELL: If this is about you fucked Melanie , I do n't give a damn . I ai n't a fool . I leave you alone with a bitch like Melanie , you 're gon na be fuckin ' that twenty minutes after I 'm out the door . So say `` thank you '' and I 'll tell you , `` you 're welcome . ''
LOUIS: That 's not what I meant when I asked did you trust her .
ORDELL: She tryin ' to work your ass against me , ai n't she ?
LOUIS: Yep .
ORDELL: You did n't even hafta say it . I know the woman .
LOUIS: Well , why the fuck keep her around ?
ORDELL: 'Cause she my fine little surfer gal . She ca n't do me no harm . Fact she think she can play you against me shows how little she knows . You could teach that bitch for days how it is 'tween me an you , she neve understand a damn word .
LOUIS: Why do you let someone know you usiness you ca n't trust ?
ORDELL: I do n't hafta trust her , I know her .
LOUIS: What does that mean ?
ORDELL: You ca n't trust Melanie . But you can always trust Melanie to be Melanie .
LOUIS: I still do n't understand why you keep her around .
ORDELL: I told you , man . She my fine little surfer gal .
ORDEL: Now she 's gon na pout
JACKIE: I need to talk to you alone .
ORDELL: What the hell you talkin ' bout ?
JACKIE: Sheronda passin ' the money onto someone else , that 's what the hell I 'm talkin ' 'bout .
ORDELL: How do you know she did that ?
JACKIE: I was there , I saw her do it .
ORDELL: Well , you were n't supposed to be there .
JACKIE: I know , but I hung around , 'cause I figured you 'd try an ' pull some shit like this .
ORDELL: Now , hold on there . I ai n't pullin ' no shit . It 's my money , I can do whatever the fuck I wan na do with it .
JACKIE: Not when it 's my ass on the line you do n't . We do this my way or fuck it .
ORDELL: Just chill the fuck out , Jackie . It ai n't no big thing . The woman you saw was my friend , Simone . She 's the one gon na be receiving the money , so I just wanted her to see how it works . She 'll be here any minute . Nice woman , you 'll like her .
JACKIE: Nicolet and Dargus stop me at the airport and mark the bills .
ORDELL: Man , I do n't like that part .
JACKIE: It washes off . I tell them we 're doing it the same way as before . They 'll follow Sheronda . I hate the idea of leaving her for a fall .
ORDELL: She wo n't have no problems 'cause she do n't know nothin ' .
JACKIE: Are you sure she don ' know about the money ?
ORDELL: She do n't know shit about the money .
JACKIE: What does she think she 's gettin ?
ORDELL: I told her this is a game us rich folks play , exchanging gifts . Like a scavenger hunt . She did n't know what that was neither . No answer ?
LOUIS: Uh-huh .
ORDELL: Hang it up , she 's on her way . You got ta listen to this . This involves you .
JACKIE: Right , the one Simone gives me . Simone and I 'll make the switch at Robinson's/May . She knows what I look like ?
ORDELL: She saw you with Sheronda . So Simone goes to the dress department with he Robinson's/May bag .
JACKIE: Designer clothes .
ORDELL: She waits for you to go in the place where you try things on .
JACKIE: The fitting room . There 's a sign ove the door .
LOUIS: Why we doin ' I there ?
JACKIE: I have a hunch they 'll be watchin ' me . We ca n't risk switching bags out in the open or even in the dining area . That 's why it has to be a woman , 'cause we do the switch in the fitting room .
ORDELL: So you come out with he Robinson's/May bag , go meet Sheronda . Simone peeks out , waits for my man Louis here to give her a signal nobody 's watchin ' . She leaves the store , gets in her car - mission accomplished .
JACKIE: Where you gon na be during all this ?
ORDELL: I 'm gon na be sittin ' at the titty ba In downtown L.A. till my man ove here calls me and gives me the O.K . sign .
JACKIE: I got ta go .
ORDELL: Who 's paging you ?
JACKIE: Ray , the A.T.F . guy .
ORDELL: That works on my nerves , you bein ' so uddy-buddy with him .
JACKIE: If I was n't , this would n't work . Now once I deliver I 'll have to trust you .
ORDELL: Well , I 've been trusting you all this time , have n't I ? We agreed on ten percent of what you bring in and that 's what you gon na get .
JACKIE: And a hundred thousand if I go to jail .
ORDELL: We 're partners , Baby , sorta . I ai n't gon na screw you . You have n't told me where I put it for you .
JACKIE: Give it to the bail bondsman , Max Cherry . He 'll take care of it .
ORDELL: Max Cherry ? You and him friends now ? You tell him about this shit ?
JACKIE: He wo n't know where the money came from . Only that it 's money .
ORDELL: Do n't you know all them bail bondsmen are crooks
JACKIE: Do you have a phone ?
WANDA: Yeah , it 's in the back .
JACKIE: Thanks .
MELANIE: Buy ya a beer ?
JACKIE: I 'm waiting for the phone .
MELANIE: Good luck . That guy 's been in there since I got here .

MELANIE: This time ? Almost a year . I 've known him forever .
JACKIE: What were you two fighting about ?
MELANIE: He told me to go outside . `` You may leave us now . '' It 's all part of his pathetic attempt to be `` the man . '' You know Mr. Walker do n't you ?
JACKIE: That coke was yours , was n't it ?
MELANIE: Oh , man , listen . I 'm sorry about that . I hope they do n't come down on you on my account . Ordell shoulda told you it was in your bag .
WANDA: Seven dollars .
JACKIE: He said he did n't know about it .
MELANIE: You believe that ? Yeah , well , I guess you have to trust him . I 'd have second thoughts on that , but then I know 'em .
JACKIE: Beaumont Livingston ?
MELANIE: You already knew that ?
JACKIE: Kinda .
MELANIE: So tell me . Having all that money in your flight bag - Is it tempting ?
JACKIE: Dreaming .
MELANIE: You know how easy it would be ? He wo n't be anywhere near that mall . Pull one more switch , up front . That 's it . half-a-million dollars . Need help ?
JACKIE: Keep it between us girls ?
MELANIE: What 's that fucker ever done for us ?
JACKIE: I do n't think so , but thanks for the eer .
MELANIE: Chicken shit .
JACKIE: Ordell has a white guy working fo him named Louis .
NICOLET: You two meet ?
JACKIE: This afternoon before I came here . He was with Ordell at an apartment in Hermosa Beach . I do n't know if he lives there , but I can find out .
NICOLET: You talk to him ?
JACKIE: Not really .
NICOLET: His full name is Louis Gara . He just got out from serving four years in Susanville .
JACKIE: What for ?
NICOLET: Bank robbery ? Do you know what he does for Ordell ?
JACKIE: I imagine shit needs to be done .
NICOLET: We 've been following Mr. Gara , and he 's definitely working for Ordell .
NICOLET: Ever meet her , or they talk about her ?
JACKIE: Not yet .
NICOLET: Who 's the other one ?
JACKIE: White girl named Melanie Ralston . Another girlfriend of Ordell 's .
NICOLET: What 's her story ?
JACKIE: It was her coke I got busted with . She knows everything , but she 's not part of it , and she 's pissed cause she 's not part of it . Ordell would n't even let her stay at the meeting . She tried to talk me into ripping off Ordell .
NICOLET: And splittin ' with her ?
JACKIE: I 'm sure that was the idea .
NICOLET: What did you say ?
JACKIE: I smiled and walked away . She also told me Ordell killed Beaumont .
NICOLET: She told you that ?
JACKIE: Uh-huh .
NICOLET: Was she there ?
JACKIE: She did n't say .
NICOLET: But she mentioned Beaumont by name ?
JACKIE: Uh-huh .
NICOLET: Well , this sounds like a lady I 'd like to have a word with . So everything 's set for tomorrow ?
JACKIE: Right . Everything 's the same , except one change
MAX: Do you think they bought it ?
JACKIE: Oh , yeah . I got them thinking Ordell 's real nervous . They love thinking he 's scared of them .
MAX: You know , a good cop wo n't let you know he knows you 're fulla shit .
JACKIE: All he needed was a reasonable explanation .
JACKIE: Right . Everything 's the same except one change . Ordell thinks it 's just too hot right now to bring in all his money . He knows you 're watching him , and he 's paranoid . He 's keeping his stash where it is , but he wants to ing in fifty thousand for bail in case he needs it .
MAX: It 'll be more than that .
JACKIE: Do n't be so literal . Ray believed it .
MAX: But you still have to show him the money at the airport .
JACKIE: Well , you know I 'm not going to show him the whole amount . He 'll see fifty thousand .
MAX: Where 's the rest of it ?
JACKIE: In the bag underneath .
MAX: What if he checks it ?
JACKIE: He wo n't - I mean , he did n't the last time . He 'll be expecting fifty thousand and there it is - on top .
MAX: You 're takin ' a helluva chance kid .
JACKIE: Not really . If he finds it , I say Mr. Walker put the money in , and I did n't know nothing about it . Like the coke .
MAX: Then you 're out and you get nothing .
JACKIE: Yeah , but I 'm not in jail and I tried .
MAX: You 're gon na have surveillance all over you .
JACKIE: That 's why you do n't make a move till I come out of the fitting room .
MAX: In a dress .
JACKIE: Well , a suit . There 's one I had my eye on .
ORDELL: It 's Ordell . We got a bit of a change in plans here . Nothing to worry 'bout - everything 's the same - except fo one change . That bitch you saw in the mall , Simone . She was n't here today , cause she split on me . Me an Louis went over to her place , she 's gone . She 's gone and all he shit 's gone and so 's my ten thousand dollars . It ai n't nothin ' to worry about , girl . Everything 's just like we discussed . Except when you do the switch , instead of Simone , it 's gon na e Melanie .
MELANIE: Chicken shit .
PASSENGER: Listen , Miss , I 'm waiting for a drink and you spend half the fuckin ' flight in the can . Soon as we land I 'm making a formal complaint .
JACKIE: Why , because I called you an asshole .
PASSENGER: You did n't call me that .
JACKIE: I did n't ? Oh , well , you 're an asshole .
NICOLET: We have to stop meeting like this .
JACKIE: You said that the last time .
NICOLET: Well , it 's true , is n't it ? After his is buttoned up we could meet someplace else . What do you think ?
JACKIE: We could , if I 'm not in jail .
NICOLET: Oh , that 's taken care of . I called the State Attorney 's Office . You were no-filed this morning in Circuit Court .
JACKIE: Are you saying I 'm off the hook ?
NICOLET: Free as a bird . I still expect you to finish the job , though . How much do you have this time ?
JACKIE: Fifty thousand , like I said . He 's pretty sure he 's gon na need it fo ail .
NICOLET: That 's fifty thousand , huh ? It does n't look like that much .
JACKIE: I was told ten thousand in each pack .
NICOLET: You did n't count it ?
JACKIE: I never have . It 's not my money .
NICOLET: He might have slipped some coke in here . Did you check ?
JACKIE: Mr. Walker promised he 'd never do that again .
NICOLET: What ? To put one of these in my pocket ?
JACKIE: Uh-huh .
NICOLET: If I did , I 'd have to give you one , would n't I ? Or we could take what we want . No one knows how much there is except us , right ?
JACKIE: Yes . All those things are true .
NICOLET: After all , it do n't belong to nobody , ight ?
JACKIE: That would be one point of view .
NICOLET: Yeah , well , it 's not a point of view that A.T.F . shares . Once we make it evidence , it belongs to us . You are now officially out of trouble . Do n't do nothing stupid , now .
JACKIE: How can I do anything if I 'm being watched every second ?
NICOLET: I 'm glad you realize that . Saves me the trouble of pointing it out to you . Put this in your shopping bag . It 's what I expect to find when I look in Sheronda 's . Comprende ?
JACKIE: Si .
MAX: I 'm going out for a few hours .
WINSTON: Hold on a minute . Where you going ?
MAX: I 'm going to Del Amo , see a movie , get something to eat .
WINSTON: Watcha gon na see ?
MAX: Whatever looks best and starts the soonest .
WINSTON: Have fun .
ORDELL: What the fuck are you two still doing there ? !
LOUIS: I was ready to leave ten minutes ago .
ORDELL: Well , you the one in motherfuckin ' charge .

JACKIE: This looks pretty good on me .
AMY: Are you kidding , it looks great . You wear this to a business meeting , you 're the badass in the room . But you can go out dancing in this too . It 's a total power suit .

MELANIE: Okay , Lou-is .
LOUIS: See , just where I fuckin ' said it was !
SALESGIRL: Can I show you something ?
MAX: Not right now . I 'm just killing time waiting for my wife . But thanks , anyway .
SALESGIRL: Sure thing . If anything grabs you , do n't be shy .
MAX: Thanks , I wo n't .
AMY: Oh , my God . You look so cool .
JACKIE: Oh , somebody left a shopping bag in there . Looks like beach towels .
MAX: Max , old boy . You 've spent nineteen years dealing with people who take incredible risks . You walk over to that counter , you 're gon na find out what it 's like .
AMY: Yeah , I think they 're back there . Go get 'em . There 's nobody in there . I think they 're in the last stall .
MAX: Thanks .
AMY: Sure thing .
BARTENDER: There a Ordell here ?
ORDELL: That 's me .
BARTENDER: Do n't talks all day .
LOUIS: It 's Louis .
ORDELL: Did you get it ?
LOUIS: I got it . Listen , there 's something else I have to tell you .
ORDELL: When I see you . Pick me up at Sam 's . You count the money ?
LOUIS: I have n't even looked at it yet , it 's still in the shopping bag .
ORDELL: Melanie must be dyin ' to see it . Louis .
LOUIS: That 's what I got to talk to you about . You see , Melanie was giving me a hard time -
ORDELL: - Not now , pick me up .
LOUIS: That 's what I got ta tell you . She ugged me the whole time . Got pissy with me 'cause I would n't let he carry the bag . Started running he fuckin ' mouth I could n't remembe ight away when we came out where the car was parked , so she got on me about that . `` Is it this aisle Lou-is , is it that one ? '' She was totally fuckin ' with my nerves .
ORDELL: So what , you left her there .
LOUIS: I shot her .
ORDELL: You shot Melanie ?
LOUIS: Twice . In the parking lot .
ORDELL: Could n't talk to her ?
LOUIS: You know how she is .
ORDELL: You could n't just hit her ?
LOUIS: Maybe but at that moment I dunno
ORDELL: You shot her twice ?
LOUIS: Uh-huh .
ORDELL: So you 're sure she 's dead .
LOUIS: Pretty sure .
ORDELL: Where did you shoot her ?
LOUIS: In the chest and stomach .
ORDELL: Well , if you had to do it , you had to do it . What we do n't want is that itch surviving on us . Anybody but that woman .
LOUIS: What ?
ORDELL: Where 's the rest of it ?
LOUIS: How much it there ?
ORDELL: Maybe forty , maybe not that much .
LOUIS: You said five hundred and fifty !
ORDELL: So you light , ai n't you . You light about a half-a-million .
LOUIS: Look , that 's the bag she came out with . She never even put her hand in it , and neither did I .
ORDELL: Came outta where ?
LOUIS: The fitting room . It went down exactly the way it was supposed to .
ORDELL: How long was she in there ?
LOUIS: Maybe a minute . She came right out .
ORDELL: Louis , You tellin ' me the truth ?
LOUIS: Look , I swear to fucking god , she came out with that bag and I took it from her .
ORDELL: Then what ?
LOUIS: We went to the parking lot .
ORDELL: Where you shot her .
LOUIS: That 's right .
ORDELL: You sure she ai n't somewhere with a half-a-million dollars I worked my ass off to earn ?
LOUIS: Fuck you for asking me that .
ORDELL: Pull the car over .
LOUIS: It 's in there .
JACKIE: Gotcha , nigga .
ORDELL: Okay , so it was Jackie Brown .
LOUIS: If she 's got it , why did n't she take it all ?
ORDELL: 'fore I blow that bitch 's brains out , I 'll ask her .
LOUIS: Maybe the Feds got it .
ORDELL: If there were nothin ; in here but towels , maybe she did n't get a chance to take it from her suitcase and A.T.F . got it . But , she put these fuckin ' books in here to trick ou ass .
LOUIS: That 's why I never checked it . The ag felt right .
ORDELL: Then she throws forty thousand in here , to rub the shit in my face , know what I 'm saying ? She wants me to know she ripped me off .
LOUIS: I do n't know . Either she has it o the Feds .
ORDELL: Or she gave it to somebody else first , before Melanie went in the dressing room .
LOUIS: Jesus Christ .
ORDELL: What ?
LOUIS: You know who I saw in the dress department ?
ORDELL: Tell me .
LOUIS: I did n't really think anything of it . No - I did wonder what he was doing there , but did n't think it had anything to do with us . You know like maybe he was there with his wife o girlfriend .
ORDELL: You gon na tell me who it was ?
LOUIS: Max Cherry .
ORDELL: You see Max Cherry in the dress department . We 're about to be handed half-a-million dollars - Man , look at me when I 'm talking to you ! And you do n't think nothing of him being there !
LOUIS: Do Max Cherry and Jackie Brown know each other ?
ORDELL: Hell , yes , they know each other . He onded her out of county .
LOUIS: How am I supposed to know that ?
ORDELL: You know the motherfucker 's a bail ondsman , do n't ya ? You know every last one of them motherfuckers is crooked as hell ?
LOUIS: Why should I think anything 's weird , if I do n't know nothin ' about them knowing each other ?
ORDELL: Man , I do n't want to hear you fuckin ' excuses !
LOUIS: I ai n't givin ' you fuckin ' excuses , I 'm givin ' you reasons .
ORDELL: Oh , you gon na tell me the reason you lost all the goddam money I got in the world ! Let me tell you the eason , motherfucker ! The reason is , your ass ai n't worth a shit no more !
LOUIS: You best back off .
ORDELL: What the fuck happened to you , man ? Shit , your ass use'ta be beautiful .
NICOLET: You did n't tell me you were gon na do some shopping .
JACKIE: I thought I did .
NICOLET: You did n't . I would think with all this on your mind , you 'd wait till after .
JACKIE: I got there early . I 've had my eye on this suit - Wait , let 's start over . I got there early . The idea was to try on the suit , see if I liked it . If I did , get them to wrap it up , and change back into my uniform . That 's what Sheronda 's expecting me to wear . Go meet Sheronda , give her the bag with fifty thousand , and go home .
NICOLET: But you did n't do that .
JACKIE: Because I did n't have it . Ray , I swear , Melanie came in and grabbed it . And someone killed her for it .
NICOLET: Where 's the bag she gave you ?
JACKIE: She did n't give me one . I told you efore , Melanie was n't part of the plan . Ordell must of told her to do it . She bursts in , grabs the shopping ag , and takes off . What am I supposed to do , go after her ? I 'm in my fucking underwear . I had to get dressed before I could do anything . So I put this back on 'cause could put this on faster than I could my uniform .
NICOLET: You took the time to pay the saleswoman .
JACKIE: I had to . I was frantic . I did n't know what to do .
NICOLET: What did you do after that ?
JACKIE: I went looking for you . I went straight to the bookstore , 'cause that 's where you were last time , but you were n't there . How the hell else am I supposed to let anybody know what happened ? You did n't tell me how to do that , did you ? I knew I was under surveillance , so when I could n't spot anybody , I started yelling .
NICOLET: There was a guy with Melanie ?
JACKIE: Not in the fitting room .
NICOLET: This guy with Melanie , that was Louis Gara ?
JACKIE: I did n't see him . I was in my underwear . If it was a white guy , it was probably Louis . He kill Melanie ?
NICOLET: It 's possible . You 're saying you do n't have any idea what happened to that fifty thousand ?
JACKIE: I have no idea .
NICOLET: You 'd take a polygraph on it ?
JACKIE: If it 'll make you happy .
NICOLET: I sure hope you have n't done anything dumb Jackie .
DARGUS: Can I have a word with you ?
NICOLET: Sure .
JACKIE: I thought you were watching him .
NICOLET: We were , and we lost him . He walked into a strip bar sometime around three thirty and never came out . The ar was on Ninth , less than a mile- and-a-half from where Louis was found dead . It looks like Louis 's friend shot him twice at point blank range .
JACKIE: So what happens now ?
NICOLET: We pick up Ordell . We 've got three murders we can link him to . We have the storage unit where he keeps his guns , by tomorrow we 'll have a search warrant to go in and get him . And we have you .
JACKIE: What about me ?
NICOLET: What about you ?
JACKIE: Do you think I took some of that money ?
NICOLET: I have no evidence of your taking anything . You did n't pay for you snazzy new suit with marked bills ; I was glad to see that . You 've been helping us out , you gave us Melanie and Louis . Melanie had a packet of marked bills stuffed in her shorts when they found her , which goes a long way backing up your story .
ORDEL: I ca n't leave here today Mr. Walker , I ai n't goin ' nowhere till I get my money You would n't have that fuckin ' boat were n't for me . Man , I 'm learnin ' real fast who my friends are Mr. Walker ?
ORDELL: Can you believe that shit ? Motherfucker hung up on me . Ingrate nigger . Do things for people and that 's how they treat you . Goddamn girl , how can you live like this ?
RAYNELLE: Like what ?
ORDELL: Girl , this shit is repugnant .
WINSTON: He ai n't here right now .
ORDELL: He leave town ?
WINSTON: He 's around .
ORDELL: Give me his home number .
WINSTON: I 'll give you his beeper .
ORDELL: Hello .
MAX: I 've been looking for you .
ORDELL: You know who this is ?
MAX: Mister Robbie , is n't it ? I have the ten thousand you put up . Is n't that why you called .
ORDELL: She got off , huh ?
MAX: They decided to no-file . Tell me where you are and I 'll bring you you money .
ORDELL: Looky here , I know you helped her and I know you know what I want Jackie can tell me any story come in that pretty head of hers . Long as at the end of that story , she hands over my money . She do that , we 're still friends . Now , she do n't wan na be my friend no more , tell her to think about ol ' Louis . And if she tries to turn me in , I 'll name her ass as my accessory . We 'll go upstate together . Hand in handcuffed hand . Now that shit 's a promise , understand what I 'm sayin ' ? You tell her that , and I 'll call you back .
MAX: You 're right , that was Ordell . You have time , you think you could find out for me where he 's staying ?
WINSTON: Cops ca n't locate him , huh ?
MAX: They do n't have your winning personality .
WINSTON: Sure thing . I do n't have to know what I 'm doing , long as you know .
MAX: I think I do . Is that good enough ?
JACKIE: Hello .
MAX: I know where he is .
JACKIE: How 'd you find out ?
MAX: All Winston had to do was ask around . Ordell 's living in Long Beach with a woman junkie .
JACKIE: How does Winston find him if A.T.F . and all the local Police ca n't ?
MAX: People talk to Winston . He 's street , same as them , they trust him . They get busted , they know somebody who can bond them out . I thought I might drop in on him . He 'll no doubt be surprised to see me .
JACKIE: He 's liable to shoot you .
MAX: On the phone I told him I have the ten thousand he put up for your bond . I could bring the money and the papers for him to sign . Walk out and call the Sheriff 's department .
JACKIE: Ray wants him .
MAX: Everybody wants him , he 's a homicide suspect . It does n't matter who brings him in , he 's gon na name you as an accessory .
JACKIE: That 's why A.T.F . 's got ta make the case . I 'm their witness . They would n't have a case without me . If it 's his word against mine , who are they gon na believe ?
MAX: It 's not that simple .
JACKIE: It never was , so I 'm not gon na start worrying about it now . Look , Ray more or less believes my story , and he more or less does n't care . All he eally gives a shit about is getting Ordell .
MAX: So how do we give Ordell to Nicolet ?
JACKIE: Get Ordell to come to your office .
MAX: Set him up .
JACKIE: Uh-huh .
MAX: Tell him you want to see him ?
JACKIE: Tell him I want to give him his money .
MAX: Why ?
JACKIE: I 've chickened out . I 'm afraid of him . He 'll like that .
MAX: What do you tell Nicolet ?
JACKIE: Ordell called and wants to meet me and I 'm scared .
MAX: We get Ordell to come to my office . Nicolet - is he already there , o does he come busting in while we 're chatting ?
JACKIE: He 's already there .
MAX: What if he hears something he 's not supposed to ?
JACKIE: Well , we do n't let that happen , now do we ?
ORDELL: What the fuck you doin ' knockin on the door like the goddamn police ? You lookin ' to get shot ?
MAX: I thought you might be asleep .
ORDELL: You keep fuckin ' with me , you 're gon na be asleep forever .
MAX: I 'm alone .
ORDELL: Git your ass in here .
MAX: You want your money ? Your bond efund ?
ORDELL: That 's all ?
MAX: I have a bond receipt for you to sign .
ORDELL: You know what the fuck I 'm talkin ' about . You talk to her ?
MAX: She wants to give you your money . If she did n't , there 'd be cops batter- amming the door right now .
ORDELL: How 'd you find me ?
MAX: Winston found you .
ORDELL: How the fuck did he find me ?
MAX: That 's what Winston does . He finds people who do n't want to be found .
ORDELL: Well , bully for that nigga . You say she wants to give me the money , huh ?
MAX: Uh-huh .
ORDELL: Well , give it to me then .
MAX: She wants to give it to you herself and collect her ten percent . She also wants to explain why she had to hold on to it .
ORDELL: I 'd like to hear that too . Turn around and put your hands on you head .
MAX: Jackie did n't trust Melanie . She 'd already tried to get Jackie to go in with her , split the half million amongst themselves . What she did was take quite a risk to see you get you money .
ORDELL: Lift up your pant leg . You help her ?
MAX: All I did was walk out with it .
ORDELL: And you did that to protect my interest ?
MAX: In a way , yes .
ORDELL: My ass be dumb , but I 'm not a dumbass . Go sit over there on the couch .
MAX: This place stinks .
ORDELL: You get used to it after a while . Now tell me where my money 's at .
MAX: My office .
ORDELL: And where 's Jackie ?
MAX: She 's been there since Thursday night .
ORDELL: She wanted to see me , why was n't she home ?
MAX: She was afraid .
ORDELL: That I got ta see .
MAX: She still is . She does n't want to get shot before she can tell you what happened .
ORDELL: Have her bring the money here .
MAX: It 's in the safe . She ca n't get at it .
ORDELL: Call her , tell her the combination .
MAX: I 'm telling you , you got her spooked . She wo n't leave there till you have your money and you 're gone .
ORDELL: You expect me to just walk in there ?
MAX: If she wanted to set you up , you 'd be in custody right now . When you said you 'd name her as an accessory she elieved you . That scares her more than anything .
ORDELL: That 's why she 's givin ' up my money huh ? Not that bullshit about Melanie . I did n't trust her ass neither , but I knew how to handle her . She was my londe-headed little surfer gal . I fuckin ' told Louis he could 've just given her a punch in the mouth , he did n't need to shoot her . She 's at your office .
MAX: Uh-huh .
ORDELL: By herself . That big mandingo nigga Winston ai n't there , is he ?
MAX: She 's all alone .
ORDELL: I call your office , she better answe the phone .
MAX: She will .
JACKIE: I 'll be here . Se ya ' in a bit .
ORDELL: All the time I 've known her , I neve heard her sound scared like that . Ordinarily she 's too cool for school . I 'm driving , gim me the keys .
MAX: It 's the next street .
ORDELL: I know where it is .
MAX: Turn left .
ORDELL: I know where to turn .
MAX: Uh-huh .
ORDELL: She starts givin ' me some bullshit about it ai n't there . It 's somewhere else and we can go get it . I 'm shootin ' you in the head right then and there . Then I 'm gon na shoot her in the kneecap , find out where my godamn money is . I go walkin ' in there and that nigga Winston o anybody else is in there , you 're the first man shot , understand what I 'm sayin ' ?
MAX: Yeah .
ORDELL: Now , is there anything you want to tell me before we get out of this car ?
MAX: No .
ORDELL: You sure ?
MAX: Yes .
ORDELL: You better be , motherfucker .
JACKIE: Mark he 's got a gun !
DARGUS: He 's dead .
MAX: In his inside coat pocket .
DARGUS: Why were you with him ?
MAX: I went to give him his refund , so he would n't have to come here .
DARGUS: How 'd you know where he was ?
MAX: I found out .
DARGUS: And you did n't tell the Police ?
MAX: I told Jackie , and Jackie said you wanted him .
JACKIE: Remember when Ray said you hoped you 'd get him before he got me ?
MAX: Hey , you .
JACKIE: I got your package . It was fun getting a half-a-million dollars in the mail .
MAX: Less ten percent .
JACKIE: Yeah , your fee . I had to figure that out , since there was n't no note .
MAX: I hesitated taking that much .
JACKIE: You worked for it - if you 're sure that 's all you want .
MAX: I 'm sure .
JACKIE: I 'm leaving , I have my things in my car . Why do n't you walk out with me ? I want to show you something .
MAX: What 's he doing ?
JACKIE: He 's on to a new thing . He 's after a guy who owns a gun shop he says is `` woefully and wantonly '' selling assault rifles to minors . He says he 's gon na take him down if it 's the last thing he does .
MAX: Did you tell him you were leaving ?
JACKIE: I told him I might .
MAX: That 's Ordell 's .
JACKIE: They 've confiscated all his othe stuff . But this one 's sorta left over . The registration 's in the glove ox , the keys were under the seat What 's a matter '' have n't you eve orrowed someone 's car ?
MAX: Not after they 're dead .
JACKIE: I did n't use you , Max .
MAX: I did n't say you did .
JACKIE: I never lied to you .
MAX: I know .
JACKIE: We 're partners .
MAX: I 'm fifty-five-years old . I ca n't lame anybody for anything I do .
JACKIE: Do you blame yourself for helping me ?
MAX: You 'll get over that .
JACKIE: Spain .
MAX: Madrid or Barcelona ?
JACKIE: Start off in Madrid . Ever been there ?
MAX: Thanks , but you have a good time .
JACKIE: Sure I ca n't twist your arm ?
MAX: Thank you for saying that , but no . My usiness .
JACKIE: I thought you were tired of you usiness ?
MAX: I 'm just tired in general .
JACKIE: Are you scared of me ?
MAX: A little bit .
JACKIE: Come over here .
JERRY: Strong stuff .
ROD: Hey , Professor , how many times can you shit in an hour ?
GEORGE: Do n't bug 'im .
DOUG: Where are those gooks already ?
FRANK: Some offensive . I do n't even think they 're out there .
PAUL: Jesus , this grass is something else .
ROD: Why even bother to pull 'em up ?
FRANK: You jackin ' off out there again , huh Jake ?
PAUL: Hey , get off his back .

JACOB: What can I tell you ?
LOUIS: I saw Sarah the other day .
JACOB: Her knee acting up ?
LOUIS: A bit .
JACOB: What did she have to say ?
LOUIS: Turn on your right side . How about the other `` right ? '' I do n't understand you philosphers . You 've got the whole world figured out but you ca n't remember the difference between right and left .
JACOB: I was absent the day they taught that in school . What did she say ?
LOUIS: Who ?
JACOB: Sarah .
LOUIS: Not much . She 's like you that way . Two clams . No wonder your marriage did n't last . Put your hand under you head . Take a breath and then let it out .
JACOB: She talk about the boys ?
LOUIS: She says she ca n't get them new coats ecause you have n't sent the alimony for three months .
JACOB: She told you that ? Did she tell you about the $ 2,000 I 'm still paying for the orthodontist ? I 'll bet she did n't mention that .
LOUIS: She said you were a son of a bitch and she regrets the day she set eyes on you .
JACOB: I thought you said she did n't say much .

JACOB: She hates me , Louis .
LOUIS: You should go back to her .
JACOB: What ? She threw me out , remember . She wanted some professor to carry he far away from Brooklyn . Only we did n't make it . She ca n't forgive me that she still lives in the same house she grew up in .
LOUIS: Her problem is that you spent eight years getting a PhD and then went to work for the post office .
JACOB: What can I tell you , Louis ? After Nam I did n't want to think anymore . I decided my brain was too small an organ to comprehend this chaos .
LOUIS: If it was any other brain but yours , I might agree . Relax , this is going to be strong .
JACOB: I ca n't relax .
LOUIS: Wiggle your toes .
MAN: I found one . He 's alive .
JACOB: God almighty . What did you do to me ?
LOUIS: I had to get in there . A deep adjustment . Rest a moment and let it set a bit .
JACOB: I had this weird flash just then .
LOUIS: What ?
JACOB: I do n't know . I 've been having them ecently . You know , you look like an angel , Louis , an overgrown cherub . Anyone ever tell you that ?
LOUIS: Yeah . You . Every time I see you . No more Errol Flynn , okay ? Your back wo n't take it . You tell your girl friend to calm down if she knows what 's good for you .

JEZZIE: 'Cause she 's always on your mind .
JACOB: When was the last time I said a word ?
JEZZIE: It has nothin ' to do with talkin ' .

YOUNG MAN: Just hold on .

YOUNG MAN: Just lie still . You 're okay . You 're not hurt .
FRANK: Did anyone see the police report ? It sounds like a detonation job to me .
JERRY: The paper said it was electrical ; a freak accident .
ROD: Bullshit . Someone 's covering somethin ' . That was no accident .
GEORGE: Why do you say that ?
ROD: Cars do n't explode that way . Any simpleton knows that .
GEORGE: But the paper
ROD: That was set . I 'm tellin ' you .
DOUG: By who ? Why ? Paul did n't have an enemy in the world .
JERRY: How do you know ?
DOUG: Hey , you 're talkin ' about Paul . Who 'd want to hurt him ?
FRANK: What did he talk about when you guys went out ? Did he say anything ?
JACOB: He was upset . He thought people were following him .
JERRY: You 're kidding . Who ?
JACOB: He did n't know Demons .
GEORGE: What do you mean , demons ?
JACOB: He told me he was going to Hell .
ROD: What 'd he say that for ? What made him say that ? Strange , huh ? Strange .
GEORGE: What else did he say , Jake ?
JACOB: He was scared . He saw these creatures coming out of the woodwork . They were tryin ' to get him , he said .

JACOB: No . Not really
GEORGE: Excuse me a minute . I 'll be right ack .
ROD: In one end , out the other , huh George ?

ROD: You 're seeing ?
DOUG: They 're not human , I 'll tell you that . A car tried to run over me the other day . It was aiming straight fo me . I saw their faces . They were n't from Brooklyn .
ROD: What are you tellin ' me ? They 're from the Bronx ?
DOUG: It was no joke , Rod .
JERRY: Something weird is going on here . What is it about us ? Even in Nam it was always weird . Are we all crazy o something ?
DOUG: Yeah , ever since that He hesitates . They all understand .
ROD: What 's that have to do with anything ?
FRANK: It was bad grass . That 's all it was .
JERRY: Grass never did that to me .
DOUG: You know , I 've been to three shrinks and a hypnotist . Nothing penetrates that night . Nothing .
ROD: It 's not worth goin ' over again and again . Whatever happened , happened . It 's over .
JACOB: I 've seen them , too .
ROD: Shit !
JERRY: So have I .
JACOB: Look , there 's something fucking strange going on here . You know Paul 's not the only one who 's died . You remember Dr. Carlson over at Bellevue ? His car blew up , too .

DOUG: Do you think it has something to do with the offensive ?
JACOB: It 's got something to do with some- thing . I think we 've got to confront the army . If they 're hiding shit from us , we better find out what it is .
ROD: Come on , Professor . The army 's not gon na give you any answers . You 'll be uttin ' your head against a stone wall .
JACOB: Maybe that 's the only way to get through . Besides , six heads 'll be etter than one .
ROD: Not my head , buddy . Not me . I 'm gettin ' a headache just listenin ' to you .
JACOB: We should get ourselves a lawyer .
ROD: I say you should get a shrink .
DOUG: Too late . I 've tried . I think you 're ight , Jake . I 'm game .
JERRY: Me , too .
ROD: You guys are fucking paranoid . It was ad grass . That 's all it was . There 's no such thing as demons .
GEARY: I 'm sorry , Mr. Singer , but do you have any idea how many people come to me with the injustices of the world ? It 'd break your heart .
JACOB: This is n't injustice , Mr. Geary . The army did something to us and we 've got to find out what .
GEARY: The army . The army . What is it with you guys ? We 're not talking about a trip to the library here . This is the United States Government for God 's sake . This is red tape coming out of your ass . You know what I mean ?
JACOB: Exactly . And we need someone to cut through it . We hear you 're the man .
GEARY: Oh yeah ? What am I - Perry Mason here ?
PAUL: Wow ! Do you think we have a chance ?
GEARY: What do you want , a fortune teller o a lawyer ? I 'll need sworn depositions from each of you and a list of the other members of the platoon , or their survivors .
DOUG: Hey , this is great .
GEARY: I 'll tell you , if we find the military is implicated in any way , you could stand to recover quite a lot of money . Not that I can predict anything , but some class action suits of this kind have been awarded fairly generous judgements . That would n't be so bad , would it Mr. Singer ?
JACOB: Doctor . Ph.D .
GEARY: Ah ! I thought you were a mailman .
JACOB: I am .
GEARY: Then why are n't you teaching ? Why are n't you in a university ?
JACOB: I 'm too messed up to teach .
GEARY: Ah ! Well then , they 're going to have to pay for that , are n't they ? The MEN all nod in agreement .
JEZZIE: So tell me am I still an angel ?
JACOB: With wings . You transport me , you know that ? You carry me away .
JEZZIE: We 're all angels , you know and devils . It 's just what you choose to see .
JACOB: I love you , Jez .
JEZZIE: I know .
JACOB: Underneath all the bullshit , just love .
JEZZIE: Remember that .
JACOB: You know what ? I feel exorcised like the demons are gone .
JEZZIE: How come ? The army ?
JACOB: In a way . At least now I have some idea of what was happening . If we can only get them to admit to explain what they did I do n't know . Maybe it 'd clear things up in my head . I 'll tell you something , Jez , honestly I thought they were real .
JEZZIE: I put a frozen dinner in the oven , a Manhandler . It 'll be ready at a quarter of . I threw a little salad together . It 's in the fridge . I also ought some apple juice , Red Cheek . Do n't drink it all . Oh , and Jake , your lawyer called .
JACOB: He did ? When ?
JEZZIE: While you were in the shower .
JACOB: Why did n't you call me ?
JEZZIE: He did n't give me a chance . Look , honey , do n't get upset , but he 's not taking your case .
JACOB: What ? What do you mean ?
JEZZIE: He said you did n't have one .
JACOB: What 's he talking about ?
JEZZIE: I do n't know . That 's all he said . He was n't very friendly . Oh , yeah . He said your buddies backed down . They chickened out , he said .
JACOB: I do n't believe this .
JEZZIE: Baby , I 'm sorry . I feel terrible . I 'd stay and talk but I 'm so late . Look , do n't be upset . We 'll talk when I get home . See you around midnight . Bye . And do n't brood . Watch T.V . o something .
JACOB: Frank . It 's Jake . Jacob SInger .
FRANK: That 's right . We did .
JACOB: What does that mean , Frank ? I do n't get it . Why ?
FRANK: It 's hard to explain .
JACOB: Well , try , huh .
FRANK: I do n't know if I can . It 's just that war is war . Things happen .
JACOB: Things happen ? What the fuck are you talking about ? They did something to us , Frank . We have to expose this .
FRANK: There 's nothing to expose .
JACOB: Jesus Christ ! Who 's been talking to you ? What 's going on ? How can you just turn away ? What about the others ?
FRANK: They 're not interested , Jake .
JACOB: Shit ! You know it 's not half the case if I go it alone . We 're all suffering the same symptoms , Frank . The army is to blame . They 've done something to us . How can you not want to know ?
FRANK: Maybe it 's not the army , Jake .
JACOB: What do you mean ?
FRANK: Maybe there 's a larger truth .
JACOB: What are you talking about ?
FRANK: Maybe the demons are real .
JACOB: Goddamn it . What kind of bullshit is that ?
FRANK: Listen , Jake . I got ta go .
JACOB: What the hell ? What kind of mumbo jumbo ?
FRANK: I 'm hanging up .
JACOB: Hey , wait !
FRANK: Do n't bother to call again , okay ?
JACOB: Shit !
GEARY: Nobody 's been talking to nobody . You do n't have a case , you hear me ? It 's pure and simple . Now leave me alone . Okay ?
JACOB: Listen , will you listen ? They 're trying to get me . They 're comin ' out of the walls . The army 's done something to me . I need you .
GEARY: You need a doctor .
JACOB: A doctor ? And what 's he gon na do , tell me I 'm crazy ? They 've fucked with my head . I 've got to prove it . You 've got to do something . GEARY gives JACOB a pitiful look .
GEARY: There 's nothing I can do .
JACOB: Something 's going on here . You 're not telling me something . What the hell 's gotten into you ?
GEARY: I 'll tell you what 's gotten into me . I do n't know you from Adam , right ? You come to my office with this izarro story and demand I look into it . Okay . I said I 'd check it out and I did . Now I do n't know what kind of fool you take me for , but you have used and abused me , and I do n't like it .
JACOB: Used you ?
GEARY: I talked to the Army 's Bureau of Records . You 've never even been to Viet Nam .
JACOB: What the hell is that supposed to mean ?
GEARY: It means that you and your buddies are whacko , that you were discharged on psychological grounds after some war games in Thailand .
JACOB: War games ? Thailand ? That 's not true ! How can you believe that ? Ca n't you see what they 're doing ? It 's all a lie . We were in Da Nang , for God 's sake . You 've got to believe me .
GEARY: I do n't have to do any such thing . I 'm eating my lunch , okay ?
JACOB: You slimy bastard ! You goddamn piece of shit !
GEARY: He 's on his way .
SOLDIER 1: Let 's go , Singer .
SOLDIER 2: You 're coming with us .
JACOB: Who are you ? What do you want ?
SANTA: Merry Christmas .
BEARER: He 's been screaming like a madman . You better get something in him .
RESIDENT: Hi . I 'm Doctor Stewart . Can you tell me what happened ?
JACOB: My back . I ca n't move . I need my chiropractor .
RESIDENT: Your back ? Did you fall ?
BEARER: They said he slipped on the ice . May have hit his head .
ATTENDANT: Does he have any identification ?
BEARER: No waller . Nothing .
JACOB: They stole it .
RESIDENT: Who did ?
JACOB: I do n't know . Santa Claus . I had my son 's picture in it . Gabe 's picture . It 's the only one I had .
RESIDENT: We better get an orthopedic man in here . Is Dr. Davis on call ?
NURSE: I 'll page him .
JACOB: Call my chiropractor .
NURSE: We 're doing everything we can .
JACOB: Louis Schwartz . Nostrand Avenue .
RESIDENT: I 'm going to have to move you a bit , just to check for injuries . This may hurt a little .
JACOB: No . Do n't move me . The RESIDENT ignores him . JACOB screams .
RESIDENT: I do n't have to ask if you can feel that .
JACOB: Goddamn it . I want Louis .
NURSE: Who 's Louis ?
RESIDENT: He 's out of it . I 'm taking him down to X-ray .
JACOB: Where are you taking me ? Where am I ?
ORDERLY: You know where you are .
JACOB: Oh God !
"DOCTOR": Where do you want to go ?
JACOB: Take me home .
"DOCTOR": Home ? This is your home . You 're dead .
JACOB: Dead ? No . I just hurt my back . I 'm not dead .
"DOCTOR": What are you then ?
JACOB: I 'm alive .
"DOCTOR": Then what are you doing here ?
JACOB: I do n't know . I do n't know . This is n't happening .
"DOCTOR": What is n't happening ?
JACOB: Let me out of here !
"DOCTOR": There is no out of here . You 've been killed . Do n't you remember ?
JACOB: No ! That was years ago ! I 've lived years since then .
"DOCTOR": It 's all been a dream .
JACOB: No ! The army did this to me ! They 've done something to my brain . Jezzie ! I want my boys ! Sarah ! I 'm not dead ! I want my family !
NURSE: He 's still pretty doped up . I do n't think he 'll be able to talk yet and I doubt that he 'll recognize you .
SARAH: I just want to see him .
JED: Dad . Hi . It 's us . We just found out .
ELI: You look terrible . Does that hurt ?
NURSE: I 'll be outside if you need me .
SARAH: Jake . It 's me . We heard what happened .
JACOB: I 'm not dead . I am not dead .
SARAH: No . Of course you 're not . You 've just hurt your back . That 's all . You 're going to be fine . It 'll just take some time .
JED: A month , they said .
ELI: You just hang in there , Dad .
SARAH: That 's not funny . What a mess , huh ? God I wish there was something I could do . I love you , Jacob . For whatever that 's worth . I do .
JACOB: No ! Oh God .
SARAH: Jacob , what can I do ?
JACOB: Save me !
NURSE: Well , do n't we look better this morning ? That was a hard night , was n't it ?
JACOB: Where am I ?
NURSE: Lennox Hospital .
JACOB: I 'm awake ?
NURSE: You look awake to me . Here . Drink some of this .
JACOB: Where 's Sarah ? Where did she go ? She was here
NURSE: No . No . You have n't had any visitors .
JACOB: That 's a lie . My family was here .
NURSE: I 'm sorry .
JACOB: Last night ! They were as real as you are ! The NURSE smiles and nods in appeasement .
NURSE: Of course it is . What else could it e ?
LOUIS: Jacob ! Jacob Singer ! JACOB yells .
JACOB: Louis ! I 'm here ! In here !
NURSE 1: You ca n't go in there !
ORDERLY: You 're going to have to leave .
LOUIS: Good God , Jake . What have they done ? What is this , the Middle Ages ? And they call this modern medicine . This is barbaric ! Barbaric ! It 's okay , Jake . It 's not serious . I 'll get you out of here . What is this , the Inquisition ? Why do n't you just burn him at the stake and put him out of his misery ?
ORDERLY: What the hell do you think ?
LOUIS: Do n't you come near me .
NURSE 2: You ca n't do that !
LOUIS: What is this , a prison ? Stay back .
NURSE 1: You ca n't . Call the police .
LOUIS: You take one step and I 'll wrap this around your neck .
LOUIS: Half an hour from now and you 'll be walking out of here all by yourself . Mark my words . Well , you 've done it to yourself this time , have n't you ?
JACOB: Am I dead , Louis ? Am I dead ?
LOUIS: From a slipped disc ? That 'd be a first .
JACOB: I was in Hell . I 've been there . It 's horrible . I do n't want to die , Louis .
LOUIS: Well , I 'll see what I can do about it .
JACOB: I 've seen it . It 's all pain .
LOUIS: You ever read Meister Eckart ? How did you ever get your Doctorate without reading Eckart ? Good . Okay , let 's turn over gently . Right side .
JACOB: What ? By myself ?
LOUIS: You can do it . Come on . Easy . Just give it a try .
JACOB: There 's something I 've got ta take care of , Louis .
LOUIS: What are you talking about ? You can arely stand .
JACOB: I 'm walking , are n't I ?
LOUIS: Jake , you need to rest .
JACOB: Not tonight , Louis . No more rest .
BYSTANDERS: Use the torch !
ONLOOKER: Shut up ! Let him talk !
JACOB: You do n't forget a battle where 500 men were killed . They did something to us . I want to know the truth , the goddamn truth . We have a right to know . Are you getting all this ? I want this on national T.V . I want the whole country , the whole world to know .
VOICE: Throw that torch away , young man . Give yourself up . You 're unde arrest .
JACOB: For what ? For seeking the truth ?
VOICE: Please come quietly .
JACOB: You come near me and I 'll blow us all up .
VOICE: We 're not going to hurt you .
ONLOOKER: Give him a chance to talk !
JACOB: The army will deny it . They 've falsified my records . They 've lied to my lawyer , threatened my buddies . But they ca n't threaten me .
BYSTANDER: You tell 'em !
VOICE: Okay , let 's clear the area . Everyone out .
JACOB: What the fuck do you think you 're doing ?
VOICE: Clear the area . This is an order !
JACOB: What is wrong with you ?
ONLOOKER: He 'll burn us all !
JACOB: Who 's there ? Who is it ?
JEZZIE: It 's just me .
JACOB: Jezzie ?
JEZZIE: Who else were you expecting ?
JACOB: Let go !
JEZZIE: Where were you , Jake ? Where 've you een ? Why have n't you called ?
JACOB: Stay away from me , Jez .
JEZZIE: I want to know . You tell me !
JACOB: You wan na know ? Turn on the T.V . Watch the fucking news !
JEZZIE: Why are you doing this to me ? You ca n't just go away like that .
JACOB: I can do anything I want .
JEZZIE: It might be for me .
JACOB: I 'm not here . You have n't seen me .
JEZZIE: Hello No . He 's not here . I have n't seen him all night I do n't know when What ? Tell him what ? Vietnam ? What experiments ? JACOB lunges for the phone .
JACOB: Hello . This is Jacob Singer . God almighty ! Yes . Yes . Right . Where would you like to meet ? How will I know you . Okay . I 'll be there .
JEZZIE: Who was that ?
JACOB: A chemist . Part of a chemical warfare unit out of Saigon . He said he knows me and that I 'll know him when I see him .
JEZZIE: How ?
JACOB: I have no idea . I was right . There were experiments . I knew it . I knew it . My God .
JEZZIE: How do you know he 's telling the truth ?
NEWSCASTER: Leading the news tonight , a bizarre demonstration on the steps of the U.S. Army Recruiting Headquarters , in downtown Manhattan . Jacob Singer , an alleged Vietnam vet
JACOB: Alleged ? Alleged ?
NEWSCASTER: challenged the United States Army to admit conducting secret experi- ments involving hundreds of American soldiers during the Vietnam war .
JEZZIE: Do n't leave me , Jake .
MICHAEL: Jacob ? Hi . I 'm Michael Newman . Friends call me Mike .
JACOB: I do n't get it . Who are you ? Why have you been following me ?
MICHAEL: Observation , mainly . Clinical study . You were one of the survivors .
JACOB: Long time ago .
MICHAEL: Next thing I know I 'm on Rikers Island . Ever been there ? Suddenly they take me from my cell to the visitors room with those bank teller windows , you know . Four army colonels , medals up their asses , are standing on the other side . They tell me if I 'll come to Vietnam for two years , no action , mind you , just work in a lab , they 'll drop all the charges and wipe the record clean . Well , I 'd only been in jail fo thirteen hours and I already knew that Nam could n't be any worse .
JACOB: Shows how much you knew .
MICHAEL: No shit . They had me by the balls . Next thing I know I 'm in Saigon in a secret lab synthesizing mind- altering drugs . Not the street stuff mind you . They had us isolating special properties . The dark side , you know ? They wanted a drug that increased aggressive tendencies .
JACOB: Yeah , sure . We were losing the war .
MICHAEL: Right . They were worried . They figured you guys were too soft . They wanted something to stir you up , tap into your anger , you know ? And we did it . The most powerful thing I eve saw . Even a bad trip , and I had my share , never compared to the fury of the Ladder .
JACOB: The Ladder ?
MICHAEL: That 's what they called it . A fast trip right down the ladder . Right to the primal fear , the base anger . I 'm tellin ' you , it was powerful stuff . But I do n't need to tell you . You know .
JACOB: Like it was yesterday .
MICHAEL: A couple days later they decided to use the Ladder , on one test attalion . Yours . Just in an infintessimal dose in the food supply , to prove its effectiveness in the field . They were sure your unit would have the highest kill ratio in the whole goddamn offensive . And you did , too . But not the way they tnought .
JACOB: None of us can remember that night . I get flashes of it but they do n't make sense . We saw shrinks for years . But nothing they did could ever touch it . What happened ? Was there ever an offensive ?
MICHAEL: A couple of days later . It was fierce . You guys never saw it .
JACOB: But there was an attack . I can still see them coming . There was a fight , was n't there ?
MICHAEL: Yeah . But not with the Cong .
JACOB: Who then ?
MICHAEL: You killed each other .
ROD: Oh my God ! WHAT 'S HAPPENING ?
MICHAEL: It was brother against brother . No discrimination . You tore each othe to pieces . I knew it would happen . I warned them . I WARNED THEM . But I was just a hippie chemist , right ? Jesus ! And I helped 'em make the stuff I talked to the guys who bagged the odies . They 're in worse shape than you , believe me . They saw what was left . It 's a blessing you do n't emember . Of course the brass covered the whole thing up right away . Blamed it all on a surprise attack . he pauses ) I needed to find you . The Ladder was my baby .
JACOB: If you knew , why did n't you say anything ?
MICHAEL: The truth can kill , my friend . Five hundred men died out there . This is n't a story they 'd ever want out . When Paul 's car blew up I realized the scope of the thing . I knew they meant business .
JACOB: So why tell me now ?
MICHAEL: Because I can get rid of the demons . I can block the Ladder . I have an antidote . We can kill them off , chemically speaking . They 'll all disappear . It 's chemistry , my friend . I know . I created it . Come with me . I can help .
JACOB: You come here often ?
MICHAEL: Sometimes . When it 's convenient .
JACOB: How do I know this is n't just some kind of , you know , seduction o something ?
MICHAEL: Hey , I 'm not the problem . You 've got igger problems than me .
JACOB: Never ?
MICHAEL: I 'd hoped I 'd never have to . Just open your mouth and stick out you tongue .
JACOB: What is it ?
MICHAEL: Do n't worry . Take it . It 'll free you head . Come on .
JACOB: I do n't know .
MICHAEL: `` Yea though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I shall fea no evil , '' but no one ever said I would n't be shittin ' in my pants every step of the way , huh ? Stick out your tongue . That ' a boy . Now why do n't you just lie down and relax .
JACOB: One drop ?
MICHAEL: It 's strong stuff .
JACOB: I think I 'm falling asleep .
MICHAEL: Pleasant dreams .
JACOB: I ca n't move .
MICHAEL: Just relax .
JACOB: What 's happening ? Help me .
MICHAEL: Take it !
JACOB: I do n't believe this . It 's a miracle , Michael . A miracle .
MICHAEL: Better living through chemistry , that 's my motto .
JACOB: It was paradise , Michael . You showed it to me . You were there .
MICHAEL: Well that 's good to know .
JACOB: Mike , it was real . It was glorious .
MICHAEL: Glorious . I 'm not surprised . I fed you enough of that stuff to send a horse to heaven . I 'm just glad you came back .
JACOB: I would have stayed there if I could .
MICHAEL: I 'm sure . You 've got nothing but troubles waitin ' for you here .
JACOB: No . I could n't .
MICHAEL: What ? You want the Plaza ? Do n't be foolish . Here . Take this , too . This is my place on Prince Street . It 's got my phone , everything . Call if you need me but you wo n't . Everything 's gon na work out . You just get outta town as fast as you can . The New York police can be effective when they want to be .
JACOB: I do n't know what to say .
MICHAEL: Save the words Just send back my credit card . MICHAEL laughs , hugs JACOB , and walks away .
JEZZIE: What are you doing here ? Are you all ight ? How do you expect to pay fo this ? Everyone 's looking for you , Jake . I dodged people all over the place , eporters , police . I do n't know what you 're gon na do .
JACOB: I 'm gon na make love to you . That 's what I 'm gon na do .
JEZZIE: Are you out of your mind ?
JACOB: Yep . Finally . I love you , Jez .
JEZZIE: God , I ca n't keep up with all you changes .
JACOB: Me neither .
JEZZIE: What 's gotten into you ? JACOB grins .
JACOB: I tell you , it was so wonderful . I felt like a little boy . I saw Paradise , Jezzie .
JEZZIE: It 's so hard to believe .
JACOB: Who 's there ?
JEZZIE: This is one of my dreams , Jake . Eve since I was a little girl . I neve thought it would happen .
JACOB: Stick with me , kid . JEZZIE smiles .
JEZZIE: I want to go with you , Jake . Whereve you go .
JACOB: It 's not practical , Jez . It 'll be hard enough alone .
JEZZIE: I can waitress . I 'm good .
JACOB: No . Things are too hot . Later . I 'll send for you .
JEZZIE: Bullshit !
JACOB: I promise .
JEZZIE: Please .
JACOB: No . I 'm a marked man , Jez . I 'm the only one left . I do n't want to expose you to that . It 's not right for you or me . Be reasonable .
JEZZIE: Reasonable ? Reasonable ? Jake You 're gettin ' me angry .
JACOB: I love you when you 're angry .
JEZZIE: Oh yeah ? Try leavin ' without me .
JACOB: Chicago . One way . For tomorrow .
SELLER: How many ?
JACOB: One .
SELLER: That 'll be $ 119.75 .
JACOB: Goddamn it ! Fucking pervert .
VOICE: Dream on !
JACOB: What ? !
MAN: You lookin ' for Mike ?
JACOB: Where is he ?
MAN: Do n't know . Has n't picked his mail up in days . It 's not like him .
JACOB: I 'm going to Brooklyn .
DRIVER: Sorry , Mac . Not with me you 're not . I get lost in Brooklyn .
JACOB: I know the way .
DRIVER: Where 's your home ?
DOORMAN: Dr. Singer . It 's been a long time .
JACOB: Hello , Sam .
DOORMAN: Are you all right ?
JACOB: I 'm okay .
DOORMAN: Do you want some help ? I can call upstairs .
JACOB: No , do n't . But thanks .
JEZZIE: Hello , Jake . I knew you 'd come here in the end . JACOB is nervous .
JACOB: What 're you ? Where 's Sarah ? Where are the boys ?
JEZZIE: Sit down , Jake .
JACOB: Where are they ?
JEZZIE: Sit down .
JACOB: No ! What 's going on ? Where 's my family ?
JEZZIE: It 's over , Jake . It 's all over .
JACOB: Where have they gone ?
JEZZIE: Wake up . Stop playing with yourself . It 's finished .
JACOB: What 's going on ?
JEZZIE: Your capacity for self-delusion is emarkable , Dr. Singer .
JACOB: Who are you ? What are you doing to me ?
JEZZIE: You have quite a mind , Jake . I loved your friends . That chemist - the Ladder . What an imagination you have ! JACOB freezes .
JACOB: WHO ARE YOU ?
JEZZIE: How many times have you asked me that ? How many times ?
JACOB: TELL ME , DAMN YOU !
JACOB: This is n't happening .
CREATURE: WHO DO YOU THINK YOU 'RE FIGHTING !
JACOB: Hello ?
GABE: Come on Dad You know what we 've got ? A sandbox just like the Williston 's , only it 's bigger and the sand 's all white . You wo n't believe it .
DOCTOR: He 's gone .
STERN: Thus at the core of today 's discu- sion we find four fundamental doc- trines . First , that the world of matter and individual consciousness are both manifestations of one Divine Reality .
PALMER: Yes , Sir . Very hard .
STERN: Well now , having reached this apotheosis there seems little , if anything , left to say . So rather than try , you are dismissed .
JACOB: Hello Prof .
STERN: My oh my . Doctor Singer . Is n't this a happy surprise ?
JACOB: The postal service . I 'm a mailman .
STERN: Ah . Neither snow nor sleet , nor dark of night I always admired that .
JACOB: It 's good to see you .
STERN: Likewise .
JACOB: I have n't seen her in months .
STERN: Ah !
JACOB: I 'm with another woman now . We 're oth with the post office , Midtown , 34th Street branch .
STERN: Hmm . I do n't suppose there are too many philosophers in the post office ?
JACOB: Oh , you 'd be surprised . They just do n't have their doctorates , that 's all .
STERN: Last I heard you were offered a posi- tion in the West somewhere . Tuscon was it ?
JACOB: Oh , that goes way back . They had a hiring freeze , one of those last min- ute things . Bad timing for me though . Middle of the war . The draft . I 'll tell you Prof , after Viet Nam I did n't want to think anymore . I decided my brain was just too small an organ to comprehend this chaos .
STERN: Jacob , if it was any other brain but yours , I might agree . Tell me , does your lady friend know what a brilliant thinker , what a sub- lime intellect she 's living with ?
JACOB: I doubt it 's my mind that interests her . I tell you Prof , she 's a fiery lady .
STERN: Well , try not to get burned . You have a great mind , Jacob . Do n't let anyone tempt you away from it .
JACOB: I 've got a problem , Prof. More Augus- tine than Kierkegaard , if you know what I mean . I need to know about demons .
STERN: Demons , Jacob ? Why demons ? Are you writing ?
JACOB: No . I see them .
STERN: See them ? What do you mean ? Physically ?
JACOB: Yes .
STERN: I know very little about demons , Ja- cob , fleshy ones anyway . I know them as literary figures , biblical ones Dante , Milton but Jacob , this is the 20th Century . We do n't see demons now .
JACOB: I see them , Prof . Everywhere . They 're invading my life . A look of concern fills STERN 's eyes .
STERN: Have you considered a doctor ? A psy- chiatrist ?
JACOB: Yes . I do n't want them . I 'm not looking for analysis or drugs . It 's too easy to dismiss as some kind of psychosis . It 's more than that . I can feel it . I need you Prof. You 're the only one I can talk to .
STERN: I do n't know what to say .
JACOB: I need your insight , your intuition . STERN sips his tea slowly . He is thinking .
STERN: Demons ? I do n't know what to tell you . It sounds like a spiritual mat- ter to me . The problem , Jacob , is that you have no context for it . You 're a renegade Existentialist suf- fering demons a hundred years afte Freud . How the hell am I supposed to make it fit ?
JACOB: I 'm afraid , Prof . Nothing makes sense . Please help me .
STERN: Jacob , I do n't believe in demons , not in the empirical sense . I do n't be- lieve in devils fighting for ou souls . I do n't believe in enternal damnation . I do n't believe in other- worldly creatures tormenting us . We do n't need them . We do a good enough job on ourselves .
JACOB: But I see them .
STERN: Look . I do n't pretend to know what 's going on inside your head . For all I know it 's pathological and they should be pumping Valium into you veins by the quart . But if you 're not willing to accept the help of sci- ence ; and believe me , I admire you for that then you 'll have to do bat- tle on your own . What can I say ? It 's a lonely pilgrimage through our times even for the strongest souls . But to e pursued by demons no less There are no guides , Jacob . You wan na know what I 'd do if I sud- denly started seeing demons ? I 'd hail the first taxi that came along , shoot over to Bellvue and beg them fo shock treatment . I 'm no saint .
JACOB: Hell , you think I am ?
STERN: I'venever understood you , you know that ? You were by far the best pupil I 've ever had , bar none . Intellectu- ally , you were the most original , the most imaginative . Who knows , maybe you 've been `` elected '' to see demons . Maybe you 're in touch with some- thing . Nothing would surprise me about you Jacob . Nothing .
VOICE: He 's burning up .
HAYES: The Reverend Norman Murphy , leader of one of the largest groups supporting the Armageddon Committee , told ou cameras that we are no longer dealing in decades but years . THE REVEREND fills the T.V . screen .
MURPHY: The battleground is being readied . Our planet is the battlefield . Ou souls are the prize . All the signs point to the inevitable confrontation etween the forces of good and evil . People must choose sides . There is no draft evasions in this war . All are called . All must take up weapons . Are you prepared ? That 's the question we ask .
HAYES: Do you find people scoffing at you , Reverend ? After all , there have been doomsayers for thousands of years and we 're still here .
MURPHY: People are less apt to laugh these days . The prophecies are too close for comfort . I mean , all you have to do is watch the news .
HAYES: There are some who claim that you pessimism is defeatist and what the world needs now is hope , a positive thrust .
MURPHY: I think the time for hope has passed . The seeds have been planted . We shall eap what we 've sown . Pessimists , no . I think we are percieved as the only realists around .
HAYES: Other movement leaders agree . In an interview
JEZZIE: So tell me am I still an angel ?
JACOB: With wings . You transport me , you know that ? You carry me away .
JEZZIE: Jake , are you all ? She stops dead in her tracks .
JACOB: Hold me , Jezzie . Hold me .
JEZZIE: You 're completely off your rocker , you know that ? You 'd think you fell on your head instead of your back . What are you planning to do , burn down the apartment along with you demons ? She begins to remove the gasoline can .
JACOB: Do n't you touch it .
JEZZIE: Cause you know goddamn well who I am .
JACOB: I do n't know you .
JEZZIE: You 've lived with me for two years .
JACOB: That does n't mean shit . Where do you come from , huh ? And I do n't mean Indiana .
JEZZIE: What do you want me to say ? My mother 's tummy ?
JACOB: You know goddamn well what I mean .
JEZZIE: You 're out of your fucking mind . I 'm not gon na stand around here gettin ' interrogated by you .
JACOB: Well leave then . Go to Hell .
JEZZIE: You son-of-a-bitch . Who do you think you are ? I do n't deserve this . Who takes care of you day and night ? Who cleans the floor and washes you goddamn underwear ? Well , I 've had it . You flip out on your own , you ungrateful bastard . I 'm done holding your hand . I do n't want anything to do with you , you hear ? Nothing !
MICHAEL: Take it !
WOMAN: It 's been four days . No word . It 's not like him . He 's never done any- thing like this before . It 's like he just disappeared from the face of the earth .
REPORTER: The Bureau of Missing Persons is con- founded by the continuing surge of eports JACOB snaps off the T.V .
JEZZIE: What 'd you do that for ? It 's an in- teresting story . All these people are still disappearing . Right off the street . Hey , what 's wrong ? Are you all right ?
JACOB: I 'm okay . I just do n't want to lis- ten .
JEZZIE: You look upset .
JACOB: I 'm not upset .
JEZZIE: Jake , what is it ?
JACOB: I 'm tired .
JEZZIE: You look terrible . What happened ? Jake is it the antidote ?
JACOB: Goddamn it . Why do you say that ?
JEZZIE: Look at yourself . You look like you 've seen a ghost .
JACOB: Shit ! Ca n't I just have a bad day ?
JEZZIE: You can have anything you want .
JACOB: Then do n't bug me .
JEZZIE: I 'm not bugging you . Come and lie down . I 'll give you a massage . Where 'd you go today ?
JACOB: Mid-town mostly .
JEZZIE: Oh yeah ? What was happenin ' there ?
JACOB: I picked up my ticket . I 'm leaving in the morning , Jez .
JEZZIE: Oh ? Where you going ?
JACOB: West .
JEZZIE: Where 's West ? New Jersey ?
JACOB: Do n't be funny .
JEZZIE: I always liked the West , west of Il- linois anyway . But you got ta give me time to pack .
JACOB: Stop it , Jez . Do n't do that .
JEZZIE: Do what ? I have n't done a thing .
JACOB: Do n't play games with me . There 's nothing more to say .
JEZZIE: Jake . What are you doing ? Look , I 'm sorry , I did n't mean to bite . Let me get you a towel .
JACOB: Hello . It 's me .
JEZZIE: Hello , Jake . I knew you 'd come here in the end . JACOB is nervous .
JACOB: Where 's Sarah ? Where are the boys ?
JEZZIE: Sit down , Jake .
JACOB: Where are they ?
JEZZIE: Sit down !
JACOB: No ! What 's going on ? Where 's my family ?
JEZZIE: It 's over , Jake . It 's all over .
JACOB: Where have they gone ?
JEZZIE: Wake up ! Stop playing with yourself . It 's finished .
JACOB: What 's going on ?
JEZZIE: Your capacity for self-delusion is emarkable , Dr. Singer .
JACOB: Oh God !
JEZZIE: What 's wrong , Jake ? Forget to take your antidote ?
JACOB: Goddamn you !
JEZZIE: I loved your chemist , Jake . The height of fantasy . And your vision of paradise . A most romantic creation . You 're quite a dreamer , Jake . Only it 's time to wake up .
JACOB: WHO ARE YOU ?
JEZZIE: How many times have you asked me that ? How many times ?
JACOB: TELL ME , DAMN YOU !
JEZZIE: You know who I am .
DEMON: Still love me , Jake ?
JACOB: NO ! ! ! ! !
ELI: Daddy !
JACOB: Oh God !
ELI: You 're hurting me !
JACOB: Stop ! ! ! !
ELI: Daddy . Let go .
JACOB: What do you want from me ?
ELI: LET GO !
VOICE: Who the Hell do you think you 're fighting ?
JACOB: Oh God , help me .
MICHAEL: I am with you , Jacob .
DOCTOR: He 's gone .
HANNAH: What do you want ? Jane manages to find her voice .
JANE: Shelter .
HANNAH: I ca n't take in vagrants . Here 's a penny . Now take it and go .
JANE: I have no strength to go .
HANNAH: You can move off . And if there are others with you tell them we are not alone . We have a gentleman here , and dogs .
JANE: But I must die if I am turned away .
ST JOHN: All of God 's creatures must die . But not prematurely - and not on my doorstep I hope .
HANNAH: We 've had a beggar woman come , M Rivers . I sent her - For shame ! Hannah falls silent as she sees Jane .
ST JOHN: You did your duty in excluding her . Let me do mine in admitting her .
DIANA: St John , who is it ?
ST JOHN: I do n't know ; I found her at the door .
HANNAH: I thought her one of the gypsies from the cross .
MARY: She 's as white as death .
DIANA: Hannah , some water .
MARY: She 's worn to nothing . She looks like a spectre . St John , if you had n't taken her in , we would have fallen upon her dead body in the morning .
DIANA: Mary .
ST JOHN: She 's no vagrant ; I 'm sure of it .
HANNAH: There 's milk and bread for you .
ST JOHN: Ask her her name .
JANE: I - I am J -
JOHN REED: Jane Eyre !
DIANA: Please , tell us how we may help you .
ST JOHN: Can we send for anyone ? Who are your people ?
JOHN REED: Come out , rat . I know you are in here . Come out now and I wo n't punish you .
JANE: What do you want ?
JOHN REED: Say forgive me , Master Reed .
JANE: I have done nothing wrong . Maste Reed . John grabs the book .
JOHN REED: Who gave you permission to read my book ?
JANE: I was n't aware it was yours .
JOHN REED: Everything in this house is mine . You 're lucky to live here with gentleman 's children like us . Your father had nothing . You should go and beg .
JANE: Wicked and cruel - you are a slaver - a murderer -
JOHN: I shall tell mother -
JANE: I hate you John Reed . I hate you -
JOHN: Mamma ! Mamma ! There 's a rat ! Rat !
BESSIE: For shame , hitting your master .
MISS ABBOT: If you do n't sit still you must e tied down !
BESSIE: What we do is for your own good . If you are passionate and rude like this , your Aunt Reed will send you away .
MISS ABBOT: You 're worse than us servants . We work for our keep ; you do nothing . Pray for forgiveness Miss Eyre or something bad will come down that chimney and fetch you away .
BESSIE: Miss Eyre what is it ?
JANE: Bessie !
BESSIE: Have you seen something ?
JANE: There was a light .
MRS REED: Bessie , I gave orders that she was to be left in the red room until I came .
BESSIE: But she screamed so loud ma'am .
MRS REED: It is play-acting . Let her go . I know your tricks Jane Eyre and I abhor such artifice . Loose Bessie 's hands , child .
JANE: No - Aunt , have pity -
MRS REED: And only when you are perfectly submissive will I let you out .
JANE: Please - I can not bear it -
MRS REED: Silence . This violence is epulsive .
JANE: I shall be killed -
MRS REED: Get back !
JANE: Have mercy , have mercy I beg you -
MARY: She 's awake .
ST JOHN: I 'm sure we 'll find she 's simply had a misunderstanding with he people . I hope she 's not done anything deplorable ; there 's nothing so sad as a fallen young woman .
MARY: Look at the suffering in he eyes . They 're like dark pools -
DIANA: She has a peculiar face ; I rathe like it .
ST JOHN: She 's not at all handsome .
DIANA: She 's so ill , St John .
ST JOHN: Ill or well , she 'll always be plain . Jane 's eyes slide away from him and close .
BROCKLEHURST: There is no sight so sad and so deplorable as that of a wicked little girl . Do you know , Jane Eyre , where the wicked go afte death ?
JANE: They go to hell .
BROCKLEHURST: And what is hell , can you tell me that ?
JANE: A pit full of fire .
BROCKLEHURST: And should you like to fall into that pit and be burning there forever ?
JANE: No sir .
BROCKLEHURST: What must you do to avoid it ?
JANE: I must keep in good health and not die .
MRS REED: I 've been her sole benefactress and her kindest friend . But she shows no gratitude and brings nothing but discord into my house .
BROCKLEHURST: What is her parentage ?
MRS REED: She 's an orphan . Her mother was my late husband 's sister . On his deathbed he exhorted me to care fo her . I have always treated her as one of my own . Jane silently revolts against this lie .
BROCKLEHURST: All liars will have their portion in the lake burning with fire and imstone . She shall be watched , Mrs Reed .
MRS REED: I wish her to be made useful , to e kept humble .
BROCKLEHURST: You can rest assured dear lady that we mortify our girls in the sentiments of vanity and pride . They are taught to be quiet , plain and modest . A passion of resentment is forming in Jane .
MRS REED: And as for its vacations , it must spend them all at Lowood .
JOHN: So , Rat , you 're being sent away . It 's as I thought ; you 're not fit to associate with me . Jane snaps . She cries out
JANE: You are not fit to associate with me !
MRS REED: How dare you speak in this manner .
JANE: I 'll never call you Aunt again as long as I live and if anyone asks how I liked you I 'll say that the very thought of you makes me sick .
MRS REED: You would n't dare .
JANE: I 'll remember how you thrust me ack into the Red Room and locked me there to my dying day . Even when you knew it was haunted and I egged to be let out . People think you are good but you are bad and hard-hearted and I 'll let everyone at Lowood know what you have done !
MRS REED: Children must be corrected fo their faults .
JANE: Deceit is not my fault !
MRS REED: But you are passionate .
JANE: My Uncle Reed is in heaven and can see all that you do and think ; so can my mother and father . They know how you hate me and wish me dead . They can see . They see everything you do and they will judge you , Mrs Reed .
BESSIE: You 're such a queer , solitary little thing . If only you could make yourself more appealing . Perhaps if you tried smiling from time to time , people would find you more pleasant -
JANE: Do n't scold me Bessie . I know you dislike me -
BESSIE: I do n't dislike you Miss ; I 'm fonder of you than of anyone .
JANE: You do n't show it .
BESSIE: Miss Jane -
MISS TEMPLE: What 's your name , child ?
JANE: Jane Eyre .
MISS TEMPLE: You are very young to be sent alone , Jane Eyre .
JANE: My name is Jane Elliott
MARY: Jane Elliot .
DIANA: Where do you come from , Miss Elliott ? Jane gives no answer .
ST JOHN: Who can we send for to help you ?
JANE: No one . There is an intake of breath from Mary .
ST JOHN: Do you mean to say that you are absolutely without home and without friends ?
JANE: Yes sir .
ST JOHN: How did you come to be roaming the moors , Miss Elliott ?
DIANA: Do n't upset her , St John . She must not be interrogated so .
JANE: Mr Rivers , you and you sisters have done me a great service , the greatest man can do - you have escued me from death .
ST JOHN: How are we to help you if we know nothing about you ?
JANE: I 'll tell you as much as I can . I am an orphan ; brought up a dependent ; educated in a charity school where I passed six years as a pupil and two as a teacher . I left a year since to become a private governess -
MARY: YES -
JANE: A good situation , where I emained until
MARY: Diana , did n't I say so ? Did n't I say she was a governess ?
DIANA: We did wonder . We mean no offence ut you have a certain look . Mary and I work as governesses too .
JANE: Do you ?
MARY: We are currently trying to teach ourselves German , so we may find etter positions .
JANE: You 're not working at present ?
DIANA: We came home only for ou father 's funeral .
MARY: He died three weeks ago .
JANE: I am very sorry to hear it .
ST JOHN: Why did you leave your place of employment ? Jane sinks back in the pillows .
JANE: I It was a catastrophe .
ST JOHN: What did you do ?
JANE: I am free from any blame , sir . I was happy . Jane is deeply distressed .
DIANA: That 's enough for now , St John .
MARY: You must rest , Miss Elliott . The name sounds strange to Jane .
ST JOHN: Why did you start ?
JANE: Because that is not my name .
DIANA: You have n't given us your real name ? Jane shakes her head .
ST JOHN: Why not ?
JANE: Because I must not ever be found .
ST JOHN: Join me to thyself with an inseparable band of love Fo thou , even thou alone , dost satisfy him that loveth thee
DIANA: Welcome to our table , Miss Elliott .
JANE: I 'd appreciate it if you called me Jane . It is my own name .
MARY: It 's wonderful to see you on you feet , Miss Jane . Jane turns her attention to St John .
JANE: I trust I will not be eating long at your expense , Mr Rivers .
ST JOHN: You wish to be independent of my charity ?
JANE: I wish to work , sir . Show me how to work or how to seek work ; that 's all I ask .
DIANA: You 're not fit enough to work .
ST JOHN: My sisters have always taken pleasure in keeping injured birds ut I 'm more inclined to put you in a way of keeping yourself - and shall endeavour to do so , if that 's what you wish .
JANE: With all my heart , sir .
DIANA: It 's a shame she has no choice of helpers , St John , and must put up with such crusty people as you .
ST JOHN: This school you were at , Miss Elliot , this charitable institution ; what did it prepare you for ?
JANE: Most thorough .
MISS SCATCHERD: Burns , Helen Burns !
BROCKLEHURST: I might have known . The new girl . Step forward , Jane Eyre . Filled with dread , Jane steps forward .
HELEN: Come now , do n't cry .
JANE: You 're not allowed to speak to me . I must be shunned .
HELEN: Mr Brocklehurst is not a God . He 's not liked or admired here -
JANE: He said I was a liar .
HELEN: JANE -
JANE: I am not a liar !
HELEN: If your own conscience approves you , then so will I. Jane is deeply gratified .
JANE: How do you bear it ?
HELEN: Bear what ?
JANE: Being struck .
HELEN: I 'm a trial to Miss Scatcherd . She hits me to improve me .
JANE: If she hit me I would get that irch from her hand and break it under her nose .
HELEN: You 'd just be punished even more . It 's part of life here .
JANE: I have always been excluded and alone and hated . Miss Abbott used to call me an ugly little toad . Helen approaches Jane .
HELEN: You 're not ugly . Do you know what is inside you ?
JANE: What ?
HELEN: The spark of your spirit , the principle of light and thought , pure and bright , as perfect as anything created .
JANE: What do you mean ?
HELEN: Your soul . Your soul is beautiful , your soul has value - more value than anything on earth .
JANE: Is that true ?
HELEN: Yes . God sees your beauty . Even as you stand on that stool , there is an invisible world around you , a kingdom of spirits . It is everywhere . Angels see your pain . Angels know your innocence .
JANE: Angels ? Helen smiles a wide smile .
HELEN: Do you not believe in angels ?
MISS TEMPLE: Come here , Girls . The girls approach , dreading more punishment .
MARY: We 've lived here all our lives but the house must be shut up now .
JANE: Why ?
MARY: We ca n't afford to keep it on . Diana and I will return to ou charges in a few days and St John will go to his parsonage .
DIANA: It 'll be a hard parting for us . We may not see him again for years .
JANE: Why ever not ?
MARY: He means to be a missionary . He 's going to India to do Gods 's work .
JANE: Can he not do God 's work here ?
MARY: This quiet parish will never do fo him ; he almost raves in his estlessness . It breaks our hearts .
DIANA: St John burns with talents and ambition . But he lacks the means for advancement here . Our poverty thwarts him at every turn and so he has chosen to lay all his gifts on God 's altar .
MARY: We 've tried to persuade him to stay but in some things ou other is - he is -
DIANA: Inexorable as death .
MARY: We are now without father . We 'll soon be without home and brother . Jane feels a powerful compassion for them .
JANE: In one thing you are fortunate . She looks over at the horizon .
MISS TEMPLE: This is the result of semi- starvation and neglected colds ; Brockelhurst 's idea of mortifying their bodies to save their souls .
MADAME PIERROT: Write to the governors . You must . Jane creeps on .
JANE: Helen .
HELEN: Is it you , Jane ? Have you come to say goodbye ?
JANE: You 're cold .
HELEN: I 'm very happy . I am going home .
JANE: Back to your father ?
HELEN: My father has a new wife . He 'll not miss me much .
JANE: Then where ?
HELEN: To my future home , where all is light . I am going to God .
JANE: No
HELEN: Do n't be sad . I will escape great suffering by dying young .
JANE: No
HELEN: I do n't have any talent to make my way in life . I should be always at fault . But God is my friend . He loves me .
JANE: Then he must save you .
HELEN: He is saving me .
JANE: I wo n't leave you .
HELEN: You 're so warm and alive . Jane , you have a passion for living .
MISS TEMPLE: Jane
JANE: No , no , no -
MARY: You are doing something already . May I see ? Jane hands her a book . She has drawn a bride .
JANE: That 's Miss Temple on her wedding day . She was my teacher ; a great influence on me . Under he guidance I became a teacher too .
MARY: St John -
JANE: No , Mary , please -
MARY: See how skilled Jane is .
ST JOHN: How fierce I am , Miss Elliott .
JANE: Mr Rivers , I wondered if you had yet heard of any work that I could do .
ST JOHN: I found you a situation some days ago but I 've delayed telling you ecause the work is lowly and I fear you 'll scorn it .
JANE: I sha n't mind what I do .
ST JOHN: As I am poor and obscure , the help I can offer is of the meanest sort .
DIANA: St John , what are you going to offer her ? Not washerwoman , I hope ?
ST JOHN: When I took over the parish two years ago it had no school . I opened one for boys ; I now intend to open one for girls . The school mistress will have a two-roomed cottage paid for by local enefactors and she will receive fifteen pounds a year . You can see how humble , how ignoble it is . On the contrary , Jane is deeply gratified .
JANE: Mr Rivers , I thank you heartily and I accept with all my heart .
ST JOHN: But you comprehend me ? It 's a village school - cottagers daughters . What will you do with all your fine accomplishments ?
JANE: I will save them until they are wanted . They will keep . Jane smiles at him . St John is impressed .
BROCKLEHURST: I hear you are to leave us , Miss Eyre . She spins around as if he is there .
JANE: Yes . Excuse me .
MRS FAIRFAX: How do you do , my dear ? What a long and tedious journey you must have had of it . John is quite the slowest driver in the county . You must be cold to the bone .
JANE: Are you Mrs Fairfax ?
MRS FAIRFAX: Indeed I am ; come and warm yourself in here .
JANE: Am I to have the pleasure of meeting Miss Fairfax tonight ?
MRS FAIRFAX: Who ?
JANE: Miss Fairfax - my pupil ?
MRS FAIRFAX: Oh you mean Miss Varens ; M Rochester 's ward . She is to be your pupil .
JANE: Who is Mr Rochester ?
MRS FAIRFAX: Why , the owner of Thornfield .
JANE: I thought Thornfield Hall elonged to you .
MRS FAIRFAX: Oh bless you child , what an idea . To me ? I am only the housekeeper .
JANE: Forgive me -
MRS FAIRFAX: There is a distant connection etween Mr Rochester and I - his mother was a Fairfax - but I 'd never presume on it . Heavens , me , owner of Thornfield ?
JANE: OH -
MRS FAIRFAX: Good night , my dear . I hope you 'll be comfy .
JANE: Thank you .
MRS FAIRFAX: Mr Rochester 's visits here are always unexpected . He does n't like to arrive and find everything all swathed up , so I keep it in constant readiness . Now , come and meet Miss Varens . Did I mention she was French ?
ADELE: Sophie has been crying because no one understands . Nobody can speak to us except for Mr Rochester and he has gone away .
MRS FAIRFAX: Would you ask her about he parents ? Mr Rochester 's neglected to tell me anything about her .
JANE: Where did you live Adele , before you came to Thornfield ?
ADELE: With Maman - but she is gone to the Holy Virgin now .
JANE: Her mother has passed away .
ADELE: Maman used to teach me to dance and say verses . When gentlemen came to see her I used to dance for them or sit on their knees and sing . May I sing for you now ?
JANE: Well - that would be lovely . Adele is going to show us he accomplishments .
MRS FAIRFAX: How very French
ADELE: Me ! It is me !
MRS FAIRFAX: Here . For you .
JANE: Who 's there ?
MRS FAIRFAX: No one . This part of the house is quite empty , except for you and me .
JANE: I heard someone .
MRS FAIRFAX: You ca n't have done .
JANE: A laugh . Someone laughed . Mrs Fairfax flounders for a second .
MRS FAIRFAX: Oh - that must be Grace Poole . She likes to sit up here with he sewing . Rather an eccentric soul . Grace ? Grace !
JANE: I 'm not in need of tea , thank you . Mrs Fairfax approaches , concerned .
MRS FAIRFAX: What is it , child ? You 've been here three months now and I 'm worried that the position is not enough / to occupy your -
JANE: Oh , Mrs Fairfax , no . I 'm so thankful to be at Thornfield . Please do n't think I 'm so ungrateful as to be discontented .
MRS FAIRFAX: But it 's a quiet life , is n't it ? This isolated house ; a still doom for a young woman Jane looks out at the view once more .
JANE: I wish a woman could have action in her life , like a man . It agitates me to pain that the sky- line over there is ever ou limit . I long sometimes for a power of vision that would overpass it . If I could behold all I imagine I 've never seen a city , never spoken with men . I 've never even seen a town of any size . And I fear my whole life will pass , without eve having
MRS FAIRFAX: Well now - exercise is a great cure for anything , they say .
ROCHESTER: What the deuce -
JANE: Can I do anything , sir ?
ROCHESTER: Get back .
JANE: Are you injured , sir ?
ROCHESTER: Where do you come from ?
JANE: Thornfield Hall .
ROCHESTER: Whose house is that ?
JANE: Mr Rochester 's .
ROCHESTER: Do you know Mr Rochester ?
JANE: No , I 've never seen him .
ROCHESTER: You 're not a servant there
JANE: I am the governess , sir .
ROCHESTER: The governess . Deuce take me , I had forgotten .
JANE: No .
ROCHESTER: Then try to get hold of his idle and lead him to me .
MRS FAIRFAX: Mr Rochester is here .
JANE: Oh ?
MRS FAIRFAX: Go and change your frock ; he wishes to meet you .
JANE: I have to change ?
MRS FAIRFAX: Oh yes - I always dress for the evening when Mr Rochester is here .
JANE: But all my dresses are the same .
MRS FAIRFAX: You must have one that is better ? He 's in a terrible humour ; the doctor has been . His horse fell in Hay lane and his ankle is sprained .
ROCHESTER: Let her sit .
JANE: Thank you .
ROCHESTER: You 've been resident here three months ?
JANE: Yes , sir .
ROCHESTER: And from whence do you hail ; what 's your tale of woe ?
JANE: Pardon ?
ROCHESTER: All governesses have a tale of woe ; what 's yours ?
SLIGHTLY INSULTED: I was brought up by my Aunt , Mrs Reed of Gateshead , in a house fa finer than this . At ten years old I went to Lowood school where I eceived as good an education as I could hope for . I have no tale of woe , sir .
ROCHESTER: Where are your parents ?
JANE: Dead .
ROCHESTER: Do you remember them ?
JANE: No .
ROCHESTER: And why are you not with Mrs Reed of Gateshead now ?
JANE: She cast me off , sir .
ROCHESTER: Why ?
JANE: Because I was burdensome and she disliked me .
ROCHESTER: Lowood ; that 's a charity school , is n't it ?
JANE: Yes .
ROCHESTER: How long did you survive there ?
JANE: Eight years .
ROCHESTER: No tale of woe
MRS FAIRFAX: I daily thank providence fo sending us Miss Eyre . She 's a kind and patient teacher and an invaluable / companion -
ROCHESTER: Do n't trouble yourself to give her a character . I 'll judge fo myself . She began by felling my horse .
MRS FAIRFAX: Sir ?
ROCHESTER: I have her to thank for this sprain .
JANE: Yes sir .
ROCHESTER: Where did you get your copies ?
JANE: Out of my head .
ROCHESTER: That head I now see on you shoulders ?
JANE: Yes sir .
ROCHESTER: Who 's this ?
JANE: The evening star . Rochester gives her a direct gaze .
ROCHESTER: Why did you bewitch my horse ? Jane can not reply .
ADELE: Tonight I will have my cadeaux . He always bring me a cadeaux . Mrs Fairfax breathlessly enters .
MRS FAIRFAX: Sorry to disturb . He 's asked fo your art . Jane looks at her in disbelief .
JANE: What for ?
MRS FAIRFAX: He wishes to have it .
JANE: Why ?
MRS FAIRFAX: To show to his company , I should think . Is this it here ? Thank you .
ADELE: Monsieur !
ROCHESTER: Ah , there she is
ADELE: Ma boite , ma boite !
ROCHESTER: Take it away you genuine daughte of Paris and amuse yourself with disembowelling it .
MRS FAIRFAX: We 'll open it together , shall we ?
ROCHESTER: Miss Eyre . Sit there .
ADELE: Oh Ciel ! Que c'est beau !
ROCHESTER: Nor do I particularly enjoy simple-minded old ladies . But you might suit me - if you would .
JANE: How , sir ?
ROCHESTER: By distracting me from the mire of my thoughts .
ADELE: Monsieur , je vous remercie mille fois de votre bonte She looks up , seeking his approval .
ROCHESTER: Precisely .
MRS FAIRFAX: Let 's try it on , shall we ? Adele skips off with Mrs Fairfax .
ROCHESTER: And that is how she charmed my English gold out of my English eeches pocket .
JANE: No sir .
ROCHESTER: What fault do you find with me ? I have all my limbs and all my
JANE: Mr Rochester , it was a blunder . I ought to have replied that eauty is of little consequence -
ROCHESTER: Now you stick a knife under my
JANE: You have other qualities , sir .
ROCHESTER: Just so ; other qualities When I was your age I was a felling enough fellow . I might have been insulted then . You 're blushing Miss Eyre .
JANE: Not at all .
ROCHESTER: And though you 're not pretty any more than I am handsome , I must say it becomes you .
HE LAUGHS: And now I see you 're fascinated y the flowers on the rug . Jane senses his mockery .
JANE: What about , sir ?
ROCHESTER: The choice of subject is entirely yours .
JANE: How can I introduce a subject when I do n't know what 'll interest you ?
ROCHESTER: The fact is , Miss Eyre , I do n't wish to treat you like an inferior .
JANE: Yet you 'd command me to speak ?
ROCHESTER: Well I probably have a right to e a little abrupt and exacting on the grounds of my superiority in age . There must be twenty years between us and a century 's advance in experience .
JANE: I do n't think you have a right to command me just because you 're older . Your claim to superiority depends on the use you 've made of your time and experience .
ROCHESTER: I 've made indifferent use of oth . And this is why I sit , galled by my own thoughts - and order you to divert me . Are you very hurt by my tone of command ? Jane smiles .
JANE: There are few masters who 'd trouble to enquire whether thei paid subordinates were hurt by their commands .
ROCHESTER: Oh yes paid subordinate ; I 'd forgotten the salary . Well on that mercenary ground , will you consent to speak with me as my equal - without thinking that the equest arises from insolence ?
JANE: I 'd never mistake informality fo insolence , sir . One , I rathe like . The other , nothing free orn should ever submit to - even for a salary .
ROCHESTER: Humbug . Most free-born things would submit to anything for a salary . But I mentally shake hands with you for your answer .
JANE: You 've clearly not spent much time in the company of schoolgirl governesses . I 'm the same plain kind of bird as all the rest , with my couple of accomplishments and my common tale of woe .
ROCHESTER: I envy you .
JANE: How ?
ROCHESTER: Your openness , your clea conscience , your unpolluted mind . If I were eighteen I think we truly would be equals . Nature meant me to e a good man , one of the bette kind and as you see , I am not so .
JANE: Are you a villain then , sir ?
ROCHESTER: I 'm a trite commonplace sinner , hackneyed in all the dissipations that the rich and worthless try to put on life .
HE SIGHS: When I was your age , fate dealt me a blow . I was - cursed with a urden to carry through life . I lacked the wisdom to remain cool and I turned desperate . Dread emorse , Miss Eyre . It is the poison of life .
JANE: Then you 'll degenerate still more .
ROCHESTER: Are you preaching to me ?
JANE: I 'm reminding you of your own words ; remorse is the poison of life .
ROCHESTER: But , Miss Eyre , if the pleasure I was seeking was sweet and fresh ; if it was an inspiration ; if it wore the robes of an angel of light what then ?
JANE: I do n't know . To speak truth , I do n't understand you at all .
ROCHESTER: My heart has long been a charnel house . Perhaps it 'll transform into a shrine .
JANE: Sir , I find the conversation has got out of my depth .
ROCHESTER: You 're afraid of me because I talk like a sphynx .
JANE: I 'm not afraid .
ROCHESTER: Yes you are .
JANE: I 've simply no wish to talk nonsense .
ROCHESTER: If you did it would be in such a grave , quiet manner that I would mistake it for sense . Do you never laugh , Miss Eyre ? This question cuts Jane to the quick .
JANE: Just as it turns to come down - that 's when you hit it .
ADELE: Because I start to win !
JANE: Have mercy , Adele . Play with Pilot for a while .
ROCHESTER: On the contrary . I like your game . I like this cold , hard day . I like Thornfield .
ADELE: Mademoiselle - Il faut jouer -
ROCHESTER: Get back ! Keep at a distance child , or go in !
JANE: To fall in love , sir ?
ROCHESTER: You 've never felt love , have you Miss Eyre ? Your soul still sleeps .
JANE: Does it ?
ROCHESTER: You 're still floating gently in the stream of life , unaware of the rocks ahead waiting to dash you to pieces .
JANE: Were you dashed to pieces , M Rochester ?
ROCHESTER: Not by Celine . How can one eve truly love a woman one has paid for ?
JANE: But you took her on ?
ROCHESTER: Some years later , I heard that Celine had abandoned the brat , disappeared to Italy and left it destitute . So I lifted it from the mud and slime of Paris and brought it here , to grow up clean in the wholesome soil of an English country garden . My one good work in a sea of countless sins . Jane is looking at Adele full of compassion .
JANE: Who 's there ?
ROCHESTER: Who 's there ?
JANE: It is I , Jane Eyre , sir .
ROCHESTER: What in the name of all the elves in Christendom have you done with me ?
JANE: For heaven 's sake get up . Somebody has plotted something ; you must find out who . I 'll light the lamp -
ROCHESTER: Light the lamp at your peril .
JANE: I heard a laugh outside my doo loud enough to wake me . I opened it . Someone was running towards the third floor .
ROCHESTER: What the deuce can she do ?
JANE: Then I 'll wake John and Martha .
ROCHESTER: Not at all . Stay here . You 're shivering .
JANE: Only the candle on the ground .
ROCHESTER: But you heard a laugh ?
JANE: Yes .
ROCHESTER: Have you heard that laugh before ?
JANE: There 's a woman who sews here ; Grace Poole - She laughs in that way , I think .
ROCHESTER: Just so . Grace Poole - you have guessed it . Well , you 're no talking fool ; please say nothing about this .
JANE: BUT -
ROCHESTER: I will account for this state of affairs . Go back to your room and say nothing .
JANE: Yes , sir . Good-night .
ROCHESTER: Is that how you 're going to leave me ?
JANE: You said I should go . Rochester approaches her .
ROCHESTER: Jane , fire is a horrible death . You have saved my life . Do n't walk past me as if we were strangers .
JANE: What am I to do then , sir ?
ROCHESTER: At least shake hands .
JANE: There is no debt .
ROCHESTER: I knew you would do me good in some way . I saw it in your eyes when I first beheld you . Their expression did not - did not strike delight into my very inmost being so , fo nothing . People talk of natural sympathies You .
JANE: Good night then , sir .
ROCHESTER: So you will leave me ?
JANE: I 'm cold .
ROCHESTER: Go .
GRACE: Good day to you , miss .
JANE: What 's happened here ?
GRACE: Only master reading in his bed last night .
JANE: I did . I heard a strange laugh .
GRACE: It 's hardly likely the maste would laugh when he was in such danger . Perhaps you were dreaming .
JANE: I was not .
GRACE: Then you did n't think of opening your door and looking out ? Jane is infuriated . She turns on her heel .
JANE: Has Mr Rochester not sent for us today ?
MRS FAIRFAX: Why , he 's gone away . Were you not aware ? He left after breakfast .
JANE: Oh ?
MRS FAIRFAX: I saw her two years ago when M Rochester had a party here . Oh , she was a beauty ; I daresay the most elegant girl I 've ever seen . So tall , with raven hair cascading down her back ; I do n't know how she 'd had it done . She sang a duet with Mr Rochester . They made a lovely harmony .
ADELE: Qu'avez vous mademoiselle ?
JANE: Nothing . Speak in English , please . Jane turns , expecting to see Adele .
ST JOHN: Do you find the work too hard ?
JANE: Not at all . I 'm getting on very well .
ST JOHN: Do you feel the solitude an oppression ?
JANE: I hardly have time to notice it .
ST JOHN: Then perhaps your accommodations have disappointed you . They are in truth scanty enough -
JANE: A few months ago I had nothing . I was wretched . Now I have a home and work ; free and honest . I wonder at the goodness of God and at the generosity of my friends . St John approaches her ; speaks intimately .
ST JOHN: What you had left before I met you , I do n't know . But I counsel you to resist firmly every temptation to look back .
JANE: It 's what I mean to do .
ST JOHN: We can overcome every kind of human weakness . A year ago I was myself intensely miserable . I considered my life was so wretched that it must be changed - or I would die . After a season of darkness and struggling , light broke . I heard my call from God . Put your trust in him , Jane . Let him lead you to you future .
JANE: Thank you . St John is turning to go .
ST JOHN: A year ago , I was weak enough to fall in love . Jane moves involuntarily towards him .
JANE: You could have been happy .
ST JOHN: A slave in a fool 's paradise ? I 'd ather my life had purpose -
JANE: Yes .
ST JOHN: Nothing in the world . He folds the paper and takes it .
MRS FAIRFAX: He 's back in three days he says - heavens that 's Thursday - and not alone . He gives directions to prepare all the best rooms . I 'm to get more staff from the George Inn . The ladies will bring thei maids , the gentlemen , valets . We must accommodate them all . Supplies to be got ; linen , the
JANE: May I assist you , Mrs Fairfax ?
UNDER COOK: She gets good wages , I 'd guess ?
LEAH: Wish I had as good ; not one fifth what Mrs Poole receives .
UNDER COOK: She 's a good hand , I daresay .
LEAH: Not everyone could do it , that 's for sure , not even for the money .
UNDER COOK: No wonder the master relies on
ADELE: They 're here ! They 're here !
MRS FAIRFAX: Thank you .
JANE: Excuse me , miss .
ROCHESTER: Good evening .
JANE: What is it , darling ?
ADELE: She sing like Maman .
MRS FAIRFAX: Tonight . He wants you both in the drawing room after dinner .
JANE: Not me , surely .
MRS FAIRFAX: It 's his particular wish .
JANE: He was being polite .
MRS FAIRFAX: I 'm instructed to tell you that if you resist , he 'll come up and get you himself . You need n't stay long . Just let him see you and then slip away . Do n't worry ; no one 'll look at you .
JANE: May I present Miss Adele Varens ?
ADELE: Bon jour , mesdames , monsieurs .
BLANCHE: Why , what a little puppet .
LADY INGRAM: Is this your ward , Mr Rochester ?
ROCHESTER: Yes .
LOUISA ESHTON: What a love of a child .
BLANCHE: I thought you were n't fond of children ?
ROCHESTER: You 're right ; I 'm not .
BLANCHE: Then what induced you to take charge of that little doll ? Rochester turns away from Jane .
ROCHESTER: She was left on my hands .
BLANCHE: Why do n't you send her to school ?
ROCHESTER: She has a governess .
BLANCHE: You should hear mamma on the chapter of governesses . I had half a dozen in my day - all detestable , ridiculous incubi - were they not , mamma ?
LADY INGRAM: Did you speak , my lily flower ?
BLANCHE: I said governesses . The reaction is instant .
LADY INGRAM: Oh , do n't mention them ; the very word makes me nervous ! I 've suffered a martyrdom from thei incompetence and caprice . I thank heaven we 're now done with them .
BLANCHE: I have just one word to say of the whole tribe ; nuisance .
ROCHESTER: Donna Bianca , I give you beauty .
BLANCHE: Beauty ? Why there 's nothing new to be said . I give you back male eauty . Mamma , what 's your idea of male beauty ?
LADY INGRAM: My son , of course .
LORD INGRAM: Hear hear .
BLANCHE: Oh , Tedo 's quite typical of the young men of today . They 're so absorbed in the pursuit of fashion that they 've forgotten how to be men at all .
LORD INGRAM: I say -
BLANCHE: A woman who neglects herself is a lot on humanity . But a man should pay no heed to his looks . A man should possess only strength and valour . He could be a gentleman or a highwayman . His eauty lies in his power .
ROCHESTER: So a Levantine pirate would do for you ?
BLANCHE: As long as he resembled you .
ROCHESTER: Why did you leave the room ?
JANE: I am tired , sir .
ROCHESTER: Why did n't you come and speak to me ? I have n't seen you for weeks . It would have been normal and polite to wish me good evening .
JANE: You seemed engaged , sir .
ROCHESTER: What have you been doing while I 've been gone ?
JANE: Teaching Adele .
ROCHESTER: You look pale .
JANE: I am well .
ROCHESTER: You 're depressed ; your eyes are shining with tears . What 's the meaning of this ?
MRS FAIRFAX: A gentleman has arrived to see you , sir .
ROCHESTER: Who ?
MRS FAIRFAX: He says he 's travelled a long way , from Spanish Town , Jamaica - Rochester seems winded .
ROCHESTER: Spanish Town
MRS FAIRFAX: Mr Richard Mason . He says you 're old friends . I 've put him in the morning room . Rochester can not speak .
ROCHESTER: Not at all . Please tell him I 'll see him directly . Mrs Fairfax goes .
JANE: Can I help you sir ?
ROCHESTER: Jane , if all those people came and spat at me , what would you do ?
JANE: Turn them out of the room sir , if I could .
ROCHESTER: And if they cast you out fo adhering to me ?
JANE: I should care nothing about it .
ROCHESTER: You 'd dare censure for my sake ? Jane is frightened of his passion .
JANE: For the sake of any friend who deserved it .
MASON: Fairfax
ROCHESTER: Richard . How the devil are you ?
HELEN: He is yours .
LADY INGRAM: Oh what is it ?
BLANCHE: Who is hurt ?
LORD INGRAM: Where the devil is Rochester ?
ROCHESTER: I 'm here , be composed . Blanche flies towards him like a banshee .
BLANCHE: What awful event has taken place ?
ROCHESTER: A servant has had a nightmare , that 's all . She 's an excitable , nervous person and has taken a fit with fright .
BLANCHE: Is there anything I might do ?
ROCHESTER: Miss Ingram , ladies , please eturn to your nests like the doves that you are . You 'll take cold for certain if you stay in this icy gallery any longer .
MASON: Am I dying ?
ROCHESTER: No .
MASON: She bit me - while the knife was in - Bit me -
ROCHESTER: It was folly to attempt the interview tonight and alone .
MASON: I thought I might have done some good .
ROCHESTER: It makes me impatient to hea you .
MASON: She sucked the blood . Said she 'd drain me - like a vampire -
ROCHESTER: Think of her as dead , dead and uried . Say nothing !
DR CARTER: I only wish I could have got here sooner . He 'd not have bled so much .
ROCHESTER: Jane , make sure the way is clear .
MASON: Fairfax - Let her treated as tenderly as may be -
ROCHESTER: I do my best and have done it and will do it !
JANE: It seems to me a splendid mansion , sir .
ROCHESTER: It is slime and cobwebs .
JANE: Will Grace Poole stay here now ?
ROCHESTER: Oh yes , do n't trouble your head about her .
JANE: But sir -
ROCHESTER: Grace Poole is not the danger .
JANE: Yes sir .
ROCHESTER: Keep vigil with me again , the night efore I marry . For now you 've met my lovely one and you know her . She 's a rare one , is n't she ?
JANE: Yes sir .
ROCHESTER: A strapper , a real strapper ; big and buxom
JANE: I 'd do anything for you sir , anything that was right .
ROCHESTER: And if I ever bid you do what was wrong , you 'd turn to me , quiet and pale and say ' I can not do it . ' And you 'd be as immutable as a fixed star .
JOHN: That 's for the look you had on your face .
JANE: Excuse me , sir . Jane has ruined Blanche 's shot .
BLANCHE: Does that creeping creature want you ?
JANE: If you please , I want leave of absence for a week or two .
ROCHESTER: What to do ? Jane shows him the letter .
JANE: This is from my old nurse , Bessie . She says my cousin John Reed is dead . He ruined himself and has committed suicide . The news has so shocked his mother , my Aunt , that it 's brought on a stroke .
ROCHESTER: What good can you do her ?
JANE: She 's been asking for me . I parted from her very badly and I ca n't neglect her wishes now .
ROCHESTER: Promise me you wo n't stay long .
JANE: Sir , it seems you are soon to be married .
ROCHESTER: What of it ?
JANE: Adele should go to school .
ROCHESTER: To get her out of my bride 's way who might otherwise trample her ?
JANE: And I must seek another situation . I intend to advertise .
ROCHESTER: At your peril you advertise . Trust it to me . I 'll find you a good situation in time .
JANE: And sir ? Forgive me but I have had no wages as yet .
ROCHESTER: How much do I owe you ?
JANE: Fifteen pounds . Rochester looks in his wallet .
ROCHESTER: Here 's fifty .
JANE: That 's too much .
ROCHESTER: Take your wages .
JANE: I can not .
ROCHESTER: Then I only have a ten .
JANE: Now you owe me five .
ROCHESTER: Just so . Come back for it quickly . Meantime , I shall safeguard it in here .
JANE: Not a whit , sir . You are not to e trusted at all . Rochester strides away , grinning . Jane turns .
BESSIE: Bless you ! - I knew you 'd come . They embrace .
JANE: Bessie I 'm not too late ? How is Mrs Reed ?
BESSIE: She may linger yet a while . She 's spoken of you daily . At first we could n't tell what she was saying ut when her speech came clear we heard 'Jane Eyre , get Jane Eyre . '
JANE: Shall I see her now ?
BESSIE: I 'll take you up directly . But look at you . What a lady you 've become . Why you 're almost pretty .
JANE: Aunt Reed ? It is Jane Eyre . You sent for me , and here I am .
MRS REED: No one knows the trouble I have with that child . Such a burden . Left on my hands . Speaking to me like a fiend . The fever at Lowood . She should have died !
JANE: Why do you hate her so ?
MRS REED: Her mother . Reed 's sister - his eloved . When news came of he death he wept like a fool . Sent for the baby . Sickly thing - not strong like mine . But Reed loved it . Kept it by his bed . Made me vow to bring the creature up . Why did he not love mine ?
JANE: I am Jane Eyre , Aunt .
MRS REED: You . Is there no one in the room ? Jane motions Bessie to go .
JANE: We are alone .
MRS REED: I 've twice done you wrong . I oke the vow I made to Reed -
JANE: Please , do n't think of it -
MRS REED: I am dying ; I must get it out !
JANE: 'Madam , will you have the goodness to send me the address of my niece , Jane Eyre . I desire her to come to me at Madeira . Fortune has lessed my endeavours and as I am childless I wish to adopt her and equeath her at my death whateve I may have to leave . Yours , John Eyre , Madeira . ' Jane is stunned .
MRS REED: Because I wrote and told him you had died of typhus at Lowood school . You fury . You were born to e my torment . I 'll never forget how you turned on me and raged .
JANE: Forgive me .
MRS REED: You cursed me .
JANE: I would have loved you if you 'd let me .
MRS REED: My life has been cursed .
JANE: Please , let us be reconciled .
ROCHESTER: A true Janian reply . If I dared I 'd touch you , to see if you were eal
JANE: Thank you Mr Rochester . I 'm strangely glad to get back again to you . Wherever you are is my home .
MRS FAIRFAX: We 're expecting the announcement very soon . He went down to London only last week to buy her a new carriage .
JANE: Then we must accept it . He 'll soon bring home his bride . Mrs Fairfax nods .
ROCHESTER: Come and look at this fellow , Jane .
JANE: I 'll be sad to leave it .
ROCHESTER: Yes , but it ca n't be helped . I soon hope to be a bridegroom .
JANE: Have you found me a new situation , sir ?
ROCHESTER: A situation , yes of course . It 's the least I can do for a faithful paid subordinate such as yourself . You 're to undertake the education of the five daughters of Mrs Dionysus O'Gall of Bitternut Lodge , Connaught .
JANE: Connaught ?
ROCHESTER: You 'll like Ireland . They 're such warm-hearted people , they say .
JANE: It is a long way away , sir .
ROCHESTER: From what ?
JANE: From here . From you .
ROCHESTER: We 've been good friends , Jane have n't we ? But with the Irish sea etween us you 'd soon forget me . Jane 's great distress escapes her .
JANE: I wish I could . I wish I 'd neve come here . I love Thornfield - I 've lived a full life here . I 've not been trampled on or petrified or buried with inferior minds . I 've talked face to face with what I reverence , with what I delight in . I 've known you Mr Rochester -
ROCHESTER: Then why must you be torn from me ?
JANE: Because of your bride .
ROCHESTER: I have no bride .
JANE: But you will have .
ROCHESTER: Yes , I will .
JANE: Then I must go .
ROCHESTER: You must stay .
JANE: Do you think I could stay to become nothing to you ? Am I an automaton , a machine without feelings ?
ROCHESTER: JANE -
JANE: I have as much soul as you and full as much heart . I 'm not speaking to you through mortal flesh . It 's my spirit that addresses your spirit as if we 'd passed through the grave and stood at God 's feet , equal - as we are . Rochester takes Jane in his arms .
ROCHESTER: As we are . Jane struggles away from him .
JANE: Let me go .
ROCHESTER: NO -
JANE: I 'm a free human being with an independent will , which I now exert to leave you .
ROCHESTER: Then let your will decide you destiny . I offer you my hand , my heart and a share of all this .
JANE: Are you mocking me ?
ROCHESTER: Do you doubt me ?
JANE: Entirely .
ROCHESTER: You have no faith in me ?
JANE: Not a whit .
ROCHESTER: You little sceptic .
JANE: Your bride is Miss Ingram -
ROCHESTER: What love have I for Miss Ingram ? What love has she for me ? I caused a rumour to reach her that my fortune was lost and got instant coldness . I wanted to make you jealous , to move you to love me . It 's you - you strange , unearthly thing . I love you as my own flesh . You - poor and obscure as you are - please accept me as your husband . Jane begins to believe him .
JANE: Are you in earnest ?
ROCHESTER: I must have you for my own .
JANE: You wish me to be your wife ?
ROCHESTER: I swear it .
JANE: You love me .
ROCHESTER: I do .
JANE: Then sir , I will marry you . They embrace .
ROCHESTER: It will atone . It will atone .
JANE: I must go .
ROCHESTER: Good night . Good night .
JANE: Good night .
MRS FAIRFAX: Have you accepted him ?
JANE: Yes .
MRS FAIRFAX: Well I never would have thought . Jane is hurt .
JANE: Am I a monster ? Is it so impossible that Mr Rocheste should love me ?
MRS FAIRFAX: No , I 've long noticed that you were a sort of pet of his . But you 're so young and so little acquainted with men . I do n't want to grieve you child , but let me put you on you guard . Gentlemen in his position Let 's just say they 're not accustomed to marry thei governesses . Until you are wed , distrust yourself as well as him . Please , keep him at a distance - Jane has heard enough . She turns away .
JANE: Thank you .
ROCHESTER: Is this my pale elf ? This sunny faced girl with the radiant eyes ?
JANE: It is I , Jane Eyre sir .
ROCHESTER: Soon to be Jane Rochester .
JANE: It can never be , sir . Human eings were not meant to enjoy complete happiness on this earth . It 's too much like a fairy tale .
ROCHESTER: Let the fairy tale begin .
JANE: Oh , no sir -
ROCHESTER: I will put the diamond chain around your neck myself -
JANE: I do n't want jewels -
ROCHESTER: I 'll dress you in these satins -
JANE: Then you wo n't know me . I 'll not e Jane Eyre any longer but an ape in a harlequin 's jacket . Put them away . Jane pushes the silks away .
ROCHESTER: Well for cool native impudence and pure innate pride , you have n't your equal .
JANE: I 'm naturally proud . And hard and flinty . You ought to know what sort of bargain you 've made while you 've still got time to rescind it . I want only one thing from you , Mr Rochester .
ROCHESTER: And what 's that ?
JANE: Your regard .
ROCHESTER: It 's your time now , little tyrant ut it 'll soon be mine and when I have seized you , to have and to hold , I 'll attach you to a chain , like this Rochester flicks his watch into the air .
JANE: Adele ?
ROCHESTER: What is it ?
JANE: I 'm afraid .
ROCHESTER: Jane , this is the only explanation . It must have been half-dream , half- eality . A woman did enter you oom last night and that woman was - must have been - Grace Poole -
JANE: It was not Grace Poole . Rochester keeps talking over her .
ROCHESTER: You know how strange she is . What did she do to me ? To Mason ? In a state between sleeping and waking -
JANE: I was not asleep .
ROCHESTER: You noticed her entrance and he actions but you 've ascribed to her an appearance different from her own . That was your nightmare -
JANE: I know what I saw .
ROCHESTER: I see you 'd ask why I keep such a woman in my house . When we 've been married a year and a day , I promise I 'll tell you . Are you satisfied Jane ? Do you accept my solution ?
ADELE: Mademoiselle
SOPHIE: Please , you must look .
ROCHESTER: Come .
WOOD: I require and charge you both , as ye will answer at the dreadful day of judgement when the secrets of all hearts shall be revealed , that if either of you know any impediment why ye may not be lawfully joined together in matrimony , ye do now confess it .
BRIGGS: The marriage can not go on . I declare the existence of an impediment . Rochester moves , shaken .
ROCHESTER: Proceed .
BRIGGS: The ceremony is quite broken off . An insuperable impediment to this marriage exists .
ROCHESTER: Proceed .
BRIGGS: Mr Rochester has a wife now living . Wood is utterly dismayed .
ROCHESTER: Where is your proof ? Briggs starts to read out a document .
BRIGGS: She was living two months ago .
ROCHESTER: How do you know ?
BRIGGS: I have a witness to the fact .
ROCHESTER: Produce him or go to hell .
MASON: Good God -
WOOD: Sir , you are in a sacred place -
ROCHESTER: What have you to say ?
MASON: She is at Thornfield Hall . I saw her there in April . I 'm he other .
ROCHESTER: This girl knew nothing . She thought all was fair and legal . She never dreamt she was going to e entrapped into a feigned union with a defrauded wretch .
GRACE: Sir , you ca n't be bringing folk in here . It 's madness .
ROCHESTER: This clothed hyena is my wife .
WOOD: Let us go . We have seen enough .
ROCHESTER: My own demon , Bertha .
BRIGGS: You , madam , are clearly not to lame . Your uncle will be glad to hear it .
JANE: Thank you .
ROCHESTER: JANE -
JANE: I can not .
ROCHESTER: I deserve a hail of fire . Jane extricates herself from his embrace .
JANE: I 'm tired and sick . I need some water .
ROCHESTER: How are you now ?
JANE: Much better , sir . I shall be well again soon .
ROCHESTER: I know you . You are thinking . Talking is no use ; you are thinking how to act .
JANE: All is changed , sir . I must change too .
ROCHESTER: Yes . There is no doubt that we oth must change . I was wrong ever to keep you here ; this narrow stone vault with its one eal fiend . I 'll shut it up . I 'll pay Mrs Poole two hundred a yea to care for its inmate and then no one will be harmed when she is prompted to burn people , to sta them , to bite the flesh from their bones -
JANE: Sir - you speak of her with hate - it is cruel . She can not help eing mad .
ROCHESTER: It 's not because she 's mad that I hate her . If you were mad do you think that I 'd hate you ?
JANE: I do .
ROCHESTER: Then you know nothing about me , nothing about the way I love . You mind is my treasure - and if it were broken it would be my treasure still . You are my sympathy , my etter self , my angel . I will wrap my whole existence round you . Let us leave here tomorrow . Come with me - as my wife .
JANE: No .
ROCHESTER: I 'll pledge you my fidelity -
JANE: You ca n't .
ROCHESTER: You 'll live a happy , most innocent life -
JANE: I must leave you , sir . Rochester can not take this in .
ROCHESTER: Do n't you love me ?
JANE: I do love you - But I must n't show it or speak it ever again . I must begin a new existence - strange scenes among strange faces . I must part from you .
ROCHESTER: Must be a part of me ; that 's what you mean . You are my wife , Jane . In truth -
JANE: You have a wife already .
ROCHESTER: I was tricked , duped into wedlock with that demon-hate , that harlot , that succubus upstairs . My fathe wanted her money and so I was sent to Spanish Town and the match was made . I hardly spoke with her . I was dazzled , ignorant , raw . My senses were besotted and I married her - gross , grovelling mole-eyed lockhead that I was . Rochester sits , staring at the fire .
JANE: I earnestly pity you , sir . He sees that Jane is silently crying .
ROCHESTER: Jane , it 's not pity that I see in your face . It 's not pity -
JANE: Do not say it -
ROCHESTER: It is love .
JANE: STOP -
ROCHESTER: I was wrong to deceive you . It was cowardly . I should have appealed to your spirit - as I do now - should have opened my life , described my hunger for a better existence - shown you my chains . I give you my life . I give you my pledge . Please , e my wife .
JANE: I can not .
ROCHESTER: You would be my equal .
JANE: How ?
ROCHESTER: I would make it so .
JANE: You once told me that hiring a mistress is the next worse thing to buying a slave .
ROCHESTER: Not my mistress -
JANE: I would not degrade you by having you live with a slave .
ROCHESTER: I said wife , my wife -
JANE: I do .
ROCHESTER: Jane He kisses her gently , lovingly .
JANE: I do .
ROCHESTER: And now ? Jane nods .
JANE: I would .
ROCHESTER: Jane , it would not be wicked to love me
JANE: It would be to obey you . I care for myself .
ROCHESTER: Will you listen to me ?
JANE: I must listen to myself -
ROCHESTER: Will you hear reason ?
JANE: Let me go -
ROCHESTER: Because if you wo n't I 'll try violence .
JANE: God help me !
ROCHESTER: You have never called me by my name . My name is Edward . Jane can not speak it . She turns away .
JANE: Edward .
ROCHESTER: Jane .
JANE: Mr St John - What on earth brings you away from your hearth on a night like this ? Has anything happened ? There 's no bad news I hope ?
ST JOHN: How easily alarmed you are .
JANE: You are recklessly rash about your own health .
ST JOHN: Nonsense .
JANE: Why are you come ?
ST JOHN: An inhospitable question .
JANE: I mean on a night like this -
ST JOHN: I got tired of my mute books and empty rooms . Besides I 've been told half a story and I 'm most impatient to find out the end .
JANE: Please
ST JOHN: Twenty years ago , a poor curate fell in love with a rich man 's daughter and married her . She was disowned by her family and two years later the rash pair were both dead . They left a daughter which charity received into her lap - as cold as that snow drift I almost stuck fast in . Charity carried the friendless thing to the house of its rich maternal relations . It was eared by an aunt-in-law ; I come to names now - Mrs Reed of Gateshead . Jane starts . She is on her feet .
JANE: Mr Rivers ! -
ST JOHN: I can guess your feelings but hea me to the end . Of Mr Rochester 's character I know nothing but he professed to offer honourable marriage to this young girl and at the very altar she discovered that he had a wife yet alive . His subsequent conduct is a matter of pure conjecture but when the governess was enquired after it was discovered that she had fled Thornfield Hall and no trace of he has since been found . Now is n't that an odd tale ?
JANE: Since you know so much , perhaps you can tell me how he is .
ST JOHN: Who ?
JANE: Mr Rochester ; how is he ?
ST JOHN: I 'm ignorant of all concerning him .
JANE: The solicitor - Mr Briggs - does he have any news of Mr Rochester ?
ST JOHN: Are you not going to enquire why he has gone to such lengths to find you ?
JANE: What does he want with me ?
ST JOHN: Merely to tell you that your uncle , Mr John Eyre of Madeira , is dead ; that he has left you all his property and that you are now rich .
JANE: What ?
ST JOHN: You are rich ; quite an heiress . Silence . Jane is flabbergasted .
JANE: How much am I worth ?
ST JOHN: Oh a trifle . Twenty thousand pounds - but what of that ? The news literally takes Jane 's breath away .
JANE: Twenty thousand pounds ?
ST JOHN: If you 'd committed a murder and I 'd found you out , you could scarcely look more aghast .
JANE: There must be some mistake . It 's two thousand , surely .
ST JOHN: It 's twenty . You look desperately miserable about it , I must say .
JANE: Why did Mr Briggs write to you ?
ST JOHN: You see , that is the strange thing . It makes me wonder what power o providence led you to our door . Your name is Jane Eyre .
JANE: Yes .
ST JOHN: Then I 'm you namesake . I was christened St John Eyre Rivers .
JANE: St John Eyre -
ST JOHN: My mother had two brothers , one was a clergyman , your father , the othe was John Eyre of Madeira . Mr Briggs wrote to inform us that the clergyman 's daughter was lost . I have been able to find her out ; that is all .
JANE: Your mother was my father 's sister ?
ST JOHN: Yes .
JANE: My uncle John was your uncle John ?
ST JOHN: That is correct .
JANE: So you , Diana and Mary -
ST JOHN: We are cousins , yes . Jane is deeply moved .
JANE: Oh , I am glad ! - I am glad !
ST JOHN: Here you are neglecting essential points to pursue trifles . You were utterly downhearted when I told you that you were rich and now , for a matter of no moment , you are deliriously happy .
JANE: Of no moment ? You have sisters and maybe do n't care for a cousin but I have nobody . I have been alone , always . And now three relations are orn into my world full grown . Oh , I am glad . You , who saved my life -
ST JOHN: You must try to tranquillise you feelings .
JANE: Write to Diana and Mary . Tell them to hand in notice and come home . They will have five thousand each and so will you .
ST JOHN: I 've told you the news too quickly . You 're confused .
JANE: Do n't put me out of patience , cousin . I am rational enough . Twenty thousand divided equally etween the nieces and nephews of our uncle , gives five to each .
ST JOHN: This is acting on first impulse . You do n't know what it is to have
JANE: And you can not imagine - family - I never had a home . I never had others and sisters - A terrible thought occurs to her .
ST JOHN: Jane , I will be your brother .
DIANA: You call Jane your sister but you do n't treat her as such . You should kiss her too . Jane turns to Diana , embarrassed .
JANE: Di , you are very provoking .
ST JOHN: Good night .
JANE: Am I not being useful ?
ST JOHN: You should look beyond Moo House , beyond the selfish calm and comfort of affluence .
JANE: Beyond to what ?
ST JOHN: I go to India in six weeks .
JANE: So soon ? - St John draws Jane away from her work .
ST JOHN: I can see what your gifts are and why they were given . Come with me . Jane is utterly crestfallen .
JANE: I 'm not fit for it . I have no vocation .
ST JOHN: You 're far too humble .
JANE: St John have mercy . I feel my mind shrinking -
ST JOHN: Do n't be afraid . You are diligent , faithful , docile , courageous , gentle and heroic . Cease to mistrust yourself . I trust you unreservedly . Let me give you time to think . But know this ; in you , I ecognise a fellow soul , a soul that would revel in the flame and excitement of sacrifice .
JANE: I used to long for a life of action , to overleap the horizon , to move in the world of men . Maybe God is giving me this . And what is there for me here ? Pain and longing for what ca n't be . I do n't know how long I would survive in India . My frame is n't strong . But I 'll go with you , if I may go free .
ST JOHN: Free ?
JANE: You and I had better not marry .
ST JOHN: Why not ?
JANE: Because I am your sister .
ST JOHN: But you 'll go with me .
JANE: Conditionally - as your curate .
ST JOHN: Jane , I do n't need a curate ; I need a wife .
JANE: I must have my heart and mind free , my own self to turn to . I could n't become part of you -
ST JOHN: A part of me you must become or the whole bargain is void . How can I , a man not yet thirty take out to India a girl of nineteen , unless she is my wife ? Do n't offer God half a sacrifice . He must have all . And undoubtedly enough of love would follow to make the union ight , even in your eyes . Jane is shocked .
JANE: Enough of love ?
ST JOHN: Yes , quite enough .
JANE: St John , I scorn your idea of love . I scorn the counterfeit sentiment you offer and I scorn you when you offer it !
ST JOHN: I 've uttered nothing that deserves scorn .
JANE: Forgive me but the very name of love is an apple of discord etween us . My dear cousin , please abandon your scheme of marriage .
ST JOHN: No ; and if you reject it , it 's not me you deny but God .
JANE: Do not be angry with me please . It makes me wretched . I want us to be friends .
ST JOHN: We are friends . I hope we can be more .
JANE: I can not come as your wife .
ST JOHN: Why this refusal ? It makes no sense !
JANE: If I were to marry you , you 'd kill me . You 're killing me now .
ST JOHN: I 'd kill you ? I am killing you ? Your words are violent , unfeminine and untrue -
JANE: You 'd kill me without drawing any lood or receiving on you conscience any stain of crime .
ST JOHN: What nonsense is this ?
JANE: You 'd experience no pain - but I tell you it would kill me !
ST JOHN: Why ?
JANE: Because I would inevitably come to conceive love for you , because you are so talented and good , because there is such grandeur in you look . You would n't want this strange and torturing love ; if I showed it you would find it unbecoming . And my lot would be wretched .
UNDERSTANDING HER: Jane
JANE: You 're a good man , but you forget the feelings of little people . We 'd etter keep out of your way lest you trample us .
ST JOHN: I would n't trample you . You 'd walk at my side towards God 's altar . He 'd be your solace , heaven your reward . We seek to do the greatest work , to open death 's gates , to save souls . Love God Jane , love God .
JANE: If I were sure ; if I were certain -
ST JOHN: What have you heard ? What can you see ?
JANE: I am coming !
MRS FAIRFAX: Come in , come in .
JANE: Is he dead ? Mrs Fairfax takes Jane in her arms .
MRS FAIRFAX: No , no . Mr Rochester still lives . Jane is crying tears of relief .
JANE: Tell me - please -
MRS FAIRFAX: Why did you run away in the night like that ? I would have helped . I would have helped .
JANE: He stayed at Thornfield ?
MRS FAIRFAX: Did n't leave the house
GRACE: Antoinetta ?
MRS FAIRFAX: He 's alive child , but many think he 'd be better off dead .
JANE: Why ?
MRS FAIRFAX: When he was taken out from unde the ruins , a beam had fallen in such a way as to protect him , partly - but his eye was taken out and his left hand so crushed that he lost it . The other eye inflamed and - he is blind . He 's lind . Tears fall from Jane 's eyes .
JANE: I had dreaded worse . I 'd dreaded he was mad . A great sense of urgency is coming over her .
ROCHESTER: I can see the candles , Martha , at your side like a luminous glow . And the fire ; a red haze .
JANE: Martha is in the kitchen , sir .
ROCHESTER: Who 's there ?
JANE: Pilot knows me . Will you have some more water ? I 've spilt half the glass . Rochester stands , holding out his hand .
ROCHESTER: If you are real , touch me .
ROCHESTER,: Her hand , her shape , her size .
JANE: And her voice .
ROCHESTER: Jane Eyre - Jane Eyre .
JANE: My Edward , I am Jane Eyre I have found you out . I am come back to you . For some while neither is able to speak .
ROCHESTER: You 're not lying dead in some ditch ? Not an outcast among strangers ?
JANE: I 've been with good people ; fa etter than you , quite more efined and exalted .
ROCHESTER: She insults me -
JANE: And I 'm an independent woman . My uncle in Madeira died and left me five thousand pounds -
ROCHESTER: This is real . This is practical .
JANE: I 'm here . I 'm home . I am where I love best .
ROCHESTER: You 're altogether a human being , Jane ?
JANE: I conscientiously believe so , sir . She is running her hands through his hair .
ROCHESTER: I 'm a sightless block -
JANE: I know . She kisses his eyes .
ROCHESTER: Am I hideous , Jane ?
JANE: Very . But you always were , you know . A smile cracks Rochester 's face .
FEMALE VOICE: Careful . . .
MALE VOICE: I know .
STONEY: Not guaranteed , if used After 2198 .
ADRIENNE: You thinking what I 'm thinking ?
STONEY: It 's over between us . You 're the only one for me !

BOEMAN: North three clicks .
KICKER: Yo , Teach , what the fuck ?

THORGAN: Somebody wanted the place to stay hidden .
KICKER: All right , all right , enough with the history
KKINSA: I have an idea , why do n't you go find them and we 'll get the hell out of here !

YLLO: Is that ?
KICKER: Now wait a minute ! I do n't think you should open that door .
YLLO: This is a science excursion corporal . Just stay out of the way . Yllo turns to the kids . He 's very excited .
KKINSA: You 're opening the door ? What about the . . . ? She points to the skull and crossbones .
DELONGPREE: I 'm thinking we should call in some experts .
YLLO: This is your find people . You want to give your credit away ?

YLLO: I do n't give a shit . This one 's prime fo decryonization . We 're brining her back .
BRODSKI: I still think we should send for a team of eal scientists .
YLLO: I am a scientist you asshole ! This could be the most important discovery in 400 years . Do you have any idea what a find like this could mean ?
BRODSKI: Right now , I care only for the safety of this
YLLO: That 's exactly what we need to find out . Check your orders , Sergeant . I out rank you where discovery is concerned . Now step aside . I have a medical emergency to deal with .

YLLO: Turn up the heat .
ADRIENNE: Done . Crystallization remains seventeen percent .
COMPUTER VOICE: Crystallization at sixty percent Subject classification . . . deformity .
ADRIENNE: Put it on the screen .
JANESSA: It 's just like Thorgan 's . What do you think this means ? Thorgan grabs his crotch .
THORGAN: This is what it means right here .
JANESSA: Small brains make your balls itch ?
DELONGPRE: And what 's with the headgear ?

YLLO: Obviously so .
RIZZO: What the hell is this shit ?
YLLO: Nanotechnology .
RIZZO: Nanobut nanotechnology is impossible .
YLLO: We 've had Nano-Tech for the last 30 years .
RIZZO: 30 ? How long was I out ?
YLLO: The year is 2455 . You 've been frozen for the past four hundred years . Rizzo gasps a shocking revelation .
RIZZO: JASON ? ! WHERE IS HE ? !
THORGAN: The hockey player ? He a friend of yours ?
RIZZO: Hockey player ? He 's not a
RIZZO: Old Earth ?
RIZZO: ButI400 years ?
YLLO: That 's right , now if you could Delongpre frowns at Yllo and moves to Rizzo .
DELONGPRE: It can wait . Let 's get you cleaned up . Delongpre helps Rizzo off the table .
YLLO: Wait a minuteI need
BRODSKI: Give it a rest Yllo . She needs some time .
DELONGPRE: Come on .
RIZZO: Yeah ?
DELONGPRE: I thought that after 400 hundred years ,
DELONGPRE: Sort of . I mean , no , not really She collapses onto the bed .
YLLO: Well ?
DELONGPRE: She needs a little time .
YLLO: More timeshit , she 's had 400 years Yllo laughs at his own joke .

RIZZO: I 'll tell you where he is . He 's walking around this ship , killing anything that moves .
JANESSA: Maybe she tripped .
BRODSKI: Jesus , God !
KICKER: Oh man , what the hell happened ?
RIZZO: Jason ! Ca n't you see ? He did this .
YLLO: Impossible ! He was dead before he entered
RIZZO: I did n't say he was alive .
DALLAS: That 's nine to four , geek-boy .
AZRAEL: You got lucky .
DALLAS: You got lucky . I could have waited until he ate your head .
AZRAEL: Speaking of which , duck !
DALLAS: He 's good .
AZRAEL: Pause play .
DALLAS: He 's not part of the program .
AZRAEL: Hey cool . They brought ancient hockey guy back to life .

DALLAS: I do n't have all day , kid .
AZRAEL: Yeah yeah I better call the labs , see what the hell is going on .
YLLO: Azrael can you repeat that ?
RIZZO: Get him out of there !
AZRAEL: I said the guy in the mask is in here uining our game . Jason starts to close in on Azrael 's pod .
YLLO: That 's impossible .
RIZZO: I told you ! Get them out of there ! Get out of there ! Get out of there now !
AZRAEL: All right fine , we 'll head back
DALLAS: Jesus !
BRODSKI: Dallas ! That you ? Come back !
DALLAS: Sarge ! Get the fuck down here ! We got a real shitstorm in the
BRODSKI: Dallas ? ! Dallas ? ! Do you copy ? Nothing . Finally
RIZZO: He 's dead . They 're both dead . You do n't understand what is on this ship . This is a being that kills . That 's what he does . That 's all he does . And he is very good at it .
BRODSKI: Kicker , Sven . Get into the grid and tell me what the hell is going on ! She gets up and heads for the door .
DELONGPRE: Where are you going ?
RIZZO: We have to get off this ship .
YLLO: That 's ridiculous . You 're overreacting .
RIZZO: Why do n't you get it ? He 's going to kill us all !
BRODSKI: I doubt that . I think we can handle whateve your ancient hockey player can throw at us .
RIZZO: I hope so .
KICKER: Damn . Are they playing ?
SVEN: Dallas ? ! Azrael !
BRODSKI: Dead ?
SVEN: Oh yeah .
KICKER: Sarge , this is Kicker . Dallas got it to . Real slice and dice . What should we do ?
BRODSKI: Report to weapons . We 're going on a hunt .
KICKER: Roger that . Time to kick some ass !
SVEN: Sorry !
KICKER: Do n't friggen do that !
BRODSKI: Yllo , what 's your head count ?
YLLO: Looks like we 're missing two . Stone and Kkinsa .
JANESSA: You know , Stoney 's done everyone on this trip but me..what 's up with that ?
BRODSKI: This place should be safe . Get them ack here . I do n't want to be hunting around and kill one of your kids by accident . As much as I 've dreamed of doing that .
RIZZO: Do n't go out there . You ca n't win . We need to get off this ship . That 's all there is to it .
BRODSKI: Not an option . I 'm going to hunt this son of a bitch down .
YLLO: Stoney ! Stoney if you can hear me , get your ass down to the lab immediately ! I 'm going to see if I can find them .
KKINSA: Sstoney 's dead !
YLLO: ALL I 'm saying is dock with Space Lab , couple of hours no more . Let them take a look at our friends .
BRODSKI: Not a chance .
YLLO: JUst do n't go in there half cocked . You guys have a tendency to blow shit up and ask questions later .
BRODSKI: You got that right . They arrive at the door of the WEAPONS ROOM .
YLLO: This thing could be worth a great deal .
BRODSKI: You sumbitch ! Three dead ! On my watch ! If thatthat thing is out there , it 's dead ! You got it ! ! !
KICKER: Fuckin A
BRODSKI: Now get out of our wayget back to the lab and baby sit your snot nosed brats we 've got a job to do !
YLLO: That bastard ! Boemen turn on the tracking monitors .
RIZZO: Robot huh ?
THORGON: Sorry , I 'm working on it .
DELONGPRE: Are all twenty-first century girls like you ?
RIZZO: He 'll kill us all . You know that , do n't you ?
THORGON: There 's been an unauthorized entrance to the Cargo Bay .
BRODSKI: Got it ! Let 's move out girls . Yllo go to Lab two and cover out backs .
BRODSKI: Alright , the teach requests we take this guy out at the knees . I say shoot to kill .
BRODSKI: Let 's move out . The doors HISS open .
THORGAN: Each blip represents a trained killer . It 's men like that fought off the pirates on Earth II , battled Jauntuns on the sola moons
RIZZO: So , you 're saying thse guys have like , lasers and stuff ? They could hack him to pieces ?
THORGAN: Exactly .
RIZZO: WHAT 'S IT MEAN WHEN ONE OF YOUR BLIPS DISAPPEARS ?
BOEMAN: Sergeant , this is Boemen
BRODSKI: Briggs , Geko , talk to me !
BRIGGS: He washe was right here !
BRODSKI: DAMNIT to hell ! We 're coming to you !
THORGAN: You see that ?
BOEMAN: Briggs , Geko , movement beyond the boxed fuselage .
BRIGGS: Got it .
THORGAN: Jesus , is this what it was like on your
BOEMAN: Sergeant , you 've lost two more men ! INT . CARGO BAy - PORTSIDE
KICKER: Jesus , Sarge , what is this thing ?
BRODSKI: Teach ! Where the hell are you ? ! Where 's our visuals ? ! !
YLLO: Fat Lou , we 're changing courses for the Solaras Space Lab .
THORGAN: Yes !
RIZZO: Listen up duck fuckers , you ca n't kill this thing .
BOEMAN: Duck fuckers ?
RIZZO: He 's either unconcious or playing dead , whichever , he ai n't really dead . Okay , you know , that 's it for me . I 'm outta here .
DELONGPRE: Outta here ?
RIZZO: Is n't there an escape POD on this ship ? Something ?
THORGON: There 's a shuttle .
RIZZO: Alright , been nice knowing you . Who 's with me ?
KKINSA: I 'll go .
BOEMEN: Yllo said stay here .
KKINSA: Fuck Yllo !
BOEMEN: They got him ! You 're not leaving !
SVEN: Big sucker too .
BRODSKI: Kicker ? Where are you ?
RIZZO: Do something ! ! !
THORGON: Do n't look at me ! I 'm in high school !
BRODSKI: Find Crutch ! Set up an ion field around the cargo bay . We 'll torch the sucker ! Ylloyou 're a dead man ! Brodski races toward the Cargo exit .
YLLO: Sergeant !
BRODSKI: What ? Yllo considers then .
YLLO: Nothing .
RIZZO: Lesson number one , kiddies . You wan na get home safely then we get off this boat . Kkinsa starts t cry .
KKINSA: I do n't understandwhat does he want ?
RIZZO: He wants to kill youand meand everyone on this ship . Rizzo looks at everyone .
YLLO: You 're not going anywhere .
RIZZO: You wan na die ?
YLLO: Are we locked down ?
BOEMAN: That door 's the only way in or out and it wo n't open without the code .
YLLO: Then we wait . We 're docking with Space La in less than an hour .
RIZZO: What good will that do ?
YLLO: They can deal with this sort of thing .
RIZZO: More soldiers ?
YLLO: Scientists . Very intellegent men .
RIZZO: That 's great . I bet they 'll kick Jason 's ass at a spelling bee !
JANESSA: Look ice chip , why do n't you just chill out and let us handle this ?
YLLO: Try to calm down . Just think , you 're going to be famous !
RIZZO: Guys , please come with me !
YLLO: 4You 're not going anywhere .
DELONGPRE: Now hold on ! We should hear her out !
THORGAN: She 's obviously dealt with this guy before .
YLLO: Shut up ! She just wants this thing dead !
DELONGPRE: No shit . I got no problem with that . Janessa readies a hypo .
THORGAN: Maybe if we knew a little bit more about what we 're delaing with here
RIZZO: tNighty-night .
CRUTCH: Leave her be .
RIZZO: Ok , who do I got ta fuck to get off this boat ? Thorgan timidly raises his hand .
THORGAN: Rizzo , a shuttle out in the middle of space ? We 'll die oout there .
RIZZO: How do you open the damn door ?
YLLO: You 're crazy !
DELONGPRE: Rizzo , he 's out there .
RIZZO: Yeah and he 'll be here soon enough . Last chance . The others stare at her . She 's crazy .
YLLO: Pack your shit . We 'll disembark in an hour . The guys at Space Lab have the necessary equipment to contain this thing and then we can study it . But the kids are n't so sure .
COMPUTER VOICE: Power to Beowulf disengaged .
FAT LOU: Disengage auto-pilot .
BERNIE: Disengaged .
FAT LOU: New COURSE , seven-eighty-one .
BERNIE: On course . ETA 36 minutes , 34 seconds .
FAT LOU: Engage auto pilot .
BERNIE: En-en-en-enEta-Eta
RIZZO: Which way ?
KKINSA: What ?
RIZZO: Ssh .
KKINSA: How do you know ?
RIZZO: I just know .
YLLO: We must assume the machete was an intricate part of the game of hockey .
DELONGPRE: I 'm thinking Rizzo was right .
YLLO: Thinking with your dick again , Delongpre ?
DELONGPRE: Maybe we should go with them . Like you said , your Space Lab connections can deal with this thing . At least we 'll be safe .
YLLO: They are not going anywhere . I cut power to the shuttle .
RIZZO: Open the doors .
KKINSA: Something 's wrong .
RIZZO: Keep trying !
YLLO: Everyone ready ? Yllo grabs a mike from a console .
THORGAN: Yuck .
DELONGPRE: We 're screwed .
YLLO: The ship does n't need pilots to dock . We 'll disembark and you 'll see . Everything will be fine .
BOEMAN: Uhthat 's gon na be a problem . The ship 's not on auto-pilot . We 're flying blind . Thirty minutes till impact .
YLLO: I guesswe 'll have to go to the bridge .
THORGAN: But Jason is out there . Then
RIZZO: Damnit , he 's got them . Kkinsa keeps trying the code box . Nothing .
KKINSA: Rizzo , I think Yllo must have done something . The door wo n't open .
YLLO: It 's alright . He ca n't get in here !
KKINSA: The power 's back up !
RIZZO: Then open the doors !
KKINSA: Thirty seconds .
JANESSA: What do we do ? ! !
YLLO: Crutch ?
CRUTCH: Help me up .
JANESSA: Okay , I 'm guessing you should hurry .
THORGAN: Jesus , tell this asshole I do n't play hockey !
CRUTCH: Okay !
YLLO: Will that take us to the bridge ?
CRUTCH: It 's a maze up there , but yes .
YLLO: We 'll engage auto-pilot ! Everything 'll be fine ! With that , the door gives !
BOEMAN: Help me !
YLLO: Now hold on ! Have you considered how valuable you are ? Credit , fame , you can have it all . And ladies . I mean , how long has it been ?
RIZZO: Threetwoone Yllo screams .
DELONGPRE: GO , GO , GO !
KKINSA: Rizzo , come on !
RIZZO: Damn ! Close the door ! I 'll be right back .
KKINSA: What ? ! !
RIZZO: I got ta go back .
KKINSA: But ? ! !
CRUTCH: Okay , we need to
BOEMAN: You forgot did n't you , you old fart ?
DELONGPRE: Shit ! Move it ! He 's coming !
DELONGPRE: He 's right on my ass ! Then Jason grabs Delongpre , who screams .
JANESSA: That was fun . Kay-Em 14 sits up , sings .
THORGAN: I did n't do it . The fall scattered he programming..wait . Where 's ? Shit !
RIZZO: Trust me , it 's temporary . Boeman takes the gun from Rizzo .
BOEMAN: Better let me .
THORGAN: Where 'd you get the gun ? Rizzo gestures at what 's left of Geko 's body .
CRUTCH: The bridge is this way ! They take off running .
RIZZO: Wait ! Everyone stops , turns
BOEMAN: What do you mean , not enough time ?
JANESSA: I think your metal lover 's losing it .
RIZZO: Guys ! ! ! The shuttle ?
CRUTCH: This way !
THORGAN: I feel better . Now how do you fire this damn thing ?
DELONGPRE: Just go ! I 've a feeling he 's right behind us !
CRUTCH: Just around this bend
BOEMAN: Nooooo !
RIZZO: What are you doing ? You ca n't save him !
DELONGPRE: No you do n't !
RIZZO: Do n't stop !
CRUTCH: Forget him . Come on .
BOEMAN: Uh-oh .
JANESSA: What ? !
BOEMAN: Kkinsa ! Open the doors !
DELONGPRE: Kkinsa , open the goddamn door !
RIZZO: Yeah , that 's it , scare the hell out of here , that 'll work .
DELONGPRE: Med-kit ?
RIZZO: I guessed .
BOEMAN: Kkinsa ! No ! ! !
RIZZO: DO N'T WASTE YOUR AMMO !
THORGAN: Did we get him ?
DELONGPRE: We 're screwed !
RIZZO: 400 years in the future and these pea-shooters are the best you can do ? !
BOEMAN: We 're not leaving Crutch !
RIZZO: We do n't have time to argue !
JANESSA: Okay , tell you what . You die , we 'll run .
COMPUTER VOICE: Collision eminent .
BOEMAN: Everyone okay ?
THORGAN: I think I broke my arm .
JANESSA: You geeks wan na gimmie a hand ?
DELONGPRE: We lost crutch .
BOEMAN: Goodbye old friend .
RIZZO: Okay , he was a great guy , now let 's move out .
BOEMAN: Could you show a little compassion ? ! Rizzo stares at Boeman .
RIZZO: Look , I 'm sorry . I really am , but are n't you forgetting about SUDDENLY a pile of rubble EXPLODES . Jason rises , his back to them .
DELONGPRE: Back to the labs !
COMPUTER VOICE: Dam-damage port side 59 percent . Decompression 40 percent . Gravity-y rotors failing .
THORGAN: Oh shit . They turn as Jason looms toward them , then
JANESSA: This is just great .
THORGAN: Grab my hand !
JANESSA: Boeman , can you reach DeLongpre ? We 'll push you in .
DELONGPRE: Hey ! That hurts .
DELONGPRE: Push off toward us .
JANESSA: Forget her , she 's a pain in the ass . Let her hang there .
THORGAN: I 'm gon na spew .
JANESSA: That ought ' a help the situation .
DELONGPRE: Do it Rizzo ! We 'll catch you .
RIZZO: What if you miss ?
DELONGPRE: What if we do n't ?
DELONGPRE: He 's coming right at you !
BOEMAN: Grab my feet !
JANESSA: Okay that hurt .
BOEMAN: Thorgan , pull us in .
THORGAN: What now ?
JANESSA: Shit . He 's gon na send himself right at us . Jason takes aim .
JANESSA: Get off of me ! They stand slowly , eyeing the rubble .
THORGAN: You think it killed . . . Yeah , I guess not .
JANESSA: Let 's just get out of here .
BOEMAN: The ship 's in bad shape . Back to the labs . Let 's check out status .
THORGAN: The hull 's imploding !
BOEMAN: Rizzo ! Can you hear me ? !
RIZZO: Yeah . Are you guys okay ?
BOEMAN: There 's a red lever on the wall eside you . Pull it !
RIZZO: It 's locked !
RIZZO: If the ship goes , so does Jaso .
BOEMAN: Rizzo pull the fucking lever !
RIZZO: No .
DELONGPRE: Rizzo ? !
RIZZO: It 's better this way . If we were rescued Jason would just get off the ship . You want him on your precious Earth II ?
THORGAN: Hurry ! She 's lost it !
JANESSA: So what else is new ?
RIZZO: Boeman do n't . You know I 'm right .
JANESSA: Are you crazy ? ! Pull the lever ! Boeman yanks the lever . As the others climb into the lab
COMPUTER VOICE: Depressurization inconclusive .
JANESSA: You happy ? You 've killed us all !
DELONGPRE: So that 's it then . It seems it is .
RIZZO: What 's that ?
BOEMAN: THat 's the sound of deep space attacking the integrity of the ship .
RIZZO: Are there any other shuttles ?
JANESSA: No .
RIZZO: Teleportation ? Some way to beam us the hell out of dodge ?
THORGAN: You read a lot of Science Fiction did n't you ?
JANESSA: A little late to be thinking about escape , is n't it ?
THORGAN: Am I in there ?
RIZZO: Hey .
DELONGPRE: That 's a good fantasy , though . Kinky , but good .
RIZZO: Hey ! !
DELONGPRE: It 's the engine , reactors , audiometers , it 's the stuff that makes the ship go zoom .
RIZZO: Can we get through these ?
THORGAN: Sure but what good will that do ?
BOEMAN: When the left hull goes , so will the ight .
RIZZO: What if we blow the walkways first ? Leave Jason over here to go up with the ship ? They stare at her .
JANESSA: You know , Yllo seemed to think we could catch this guy alive , well , he 'd be worth millions . The others stare at her as if she were crazy .
RIZZO: Any connection between your reality and mine is purely coincidental .
JANESSA: I 'm just saying .
RIZZO: Come on . You got all these gadgets and shit .
DELONGPRE: We 'd need charges .
BOEMAN: We could convert fission transistors .
THORGAN: We 're not supposed to do that .
BOEMAN: What are you gon na do , tell me ?
DELONGPRE: The engine room will have molecular welders . We could seal up the hull .
JANESSA: YeaH , GREAT IDEA ! And I 'll keep the big guy distracted with a blow job .
THORGAN: Would you ?
DELONGPRE: Remember to roll his balls around a bit .
RIZZO: You got a better plan ?
BOEMAN: I 'll need system four converters .
THORGAN: They 're back here .
DELONGPRE: How many ?
BOEMAN: Bring 'em all . Let 's move !
THORGAN: Hey ! I 'm not ready .
BOEMAN: Then you better hurry . I 'll blow alley one , Delongpre , you and Rizzo take there .
JANESSA: You 're so bossy .
THORGAN: You 're leaving me here alone ? Delongpre tosses the chaingun next to him .
DELONGPRE: Do n't blow your foot off .
THORGAN: Come here , might as well fix that arm .
DELONGPRE: See anything ?
BOEMAN: Thorgan ? You coming ? !
THORGAN: Almost done .
DELONGPRE: Put your finger here .
RIZZO: So , you thought you 'd be cool . Go against your father 's wishes ? Yeah , that 's grown up . Delongpre looks at her like she 's crazy .
RIZZO: I thought you meant
THORGAN: Sorry , sorry .
JANESSA: Thorgan , you little shit , is that you ?
RIZZO: When I was four , the ocean quit producing life . Too many pollutants . Nuclear testing , the occasional terrorist bombingthe atmosphere was shit by the time I was eight . We moved underground when I was twelve .
DELONGPRE: Were you close to your father ? Thorgan interrupts over the headset .
DELONGPRE: And what happend to ? Rizzo begins to tear up .
RIZZO: I could n't save them .
DELONGPRE: Well , we 'd be dead without you . You know that , do n't you ? She stares at him .
BRODSKI: Where is everybody ? What happened ?
JANESSA: Damnit ! You scared the hell out of me !
BRODSKI: Give me a break ! What happened ?
JANESSA: Jason . He 's what happened . Then Grendel hit Space Lab .
BRODSKI: Space Lab ? ! Wait 'll I get my hands on Yllo .
JANESSA: Yllo 's dead . Wewe thought you were too .
BRODSKI: Takes more than a steelbalde to take this old dog down .
BRODSKI: He-help me He holds his hand out to her . Then
DELONGPRE: We 're blowing three . Hang on . He throws a switch !
BOEMAN: Janessa , we 're on our way to you !
DELONGPRE: You tell me ! She 's only set one charge . And it 's not finished !
BOEMAN: Where have you been ? ! !
JANESSA: He.He
DELONGPRE: He 's coming ! ! !
BOEMAN: Run ! !
RIZZO: We ca n't lead him into the other hull !
BOEMAN: We do n't have a choice !
THORGAN: Yes , I 've reprogrammed you . You are very brave . Bad ass .
DELONGPRE: Holy shit !
BOEMAN: What are we waiting for ? ! ! Come on ! !
JANESSA: He came for me , I had to run !
THORGAN: Kay-Em , you okay ?
BOEMAN: Toss me a chip .
THORGAN: See you around .
BOEMAN: I 'd say we have about ten minutes tops .
DELONGPRE: Then stop talking and work faster !
BOEMAN: Okay , Janessa , give me your last charge . Janessa looks around , then
JANESSA: II do n't know what I did
DELONGPRE: You lost the charge ?
JANESSA: He was chasing me !
RIZZO: Can we blow it with just two ?
BOEMAN: If we do n't sever the hull completely she 'll drag us down with her .
DELONGPRE: Then what do we do ? !
BOEMAN: I do n't know !
DELONGPRE: Well , it was a good plan . They look at one another hopless . Then
BOEMAN: Sergeant ? We thought you were
BRODSKI: Yeah , yeah . Well , what have you got to say for yourself ?
JANESSA: I do n't knowsorry ?
RIZZO: Sergeant , we could use a big bomb .
BRODSKI: Bomb ?
BOEMAN: Explosive . We 're blowing the walkway . The sergeant tosses his pack to the ground .
BRODSKI: How much you need ?
BOEMAN: Rizzo did .
THORGAN: Kay-Em !
BOEMAN: What are you doing back ? ! !
RIZZO: You killed him ?
THORGAN: You did good , Kay-Em . I 'm proud of you .
RIZZO: His mother ?
BOEMAN: What ?
RIZZO: I do n't know . Nothing .
BOEMAN: Hurry up people ! We 're running out of time .
THORGAN: As long as they 're connected we can low them all simultaneously from a safe distance .
BOEMAN: Two more charges to go .
THORGAN: Done !
BOEMAN: Let 's move out !
BRODSKI: Kid , you ever thought about the marine corp ?
DELONGPRE: I need another minute . Come on !
BRODSKI: Well fuck me .
THORGAN: Kay-Em ? Re-engage killer instinct .
BOEMAN: Shit !
THORGAN: Kay-Em ! ! ! Boeman splices the wires together .
BOEMAN: Done ! ! Then turns to see Jason approaching .
THORGAN: Kay-Em ! Get away !
BOEMAN: What ? Thorgan turns , runs back toward Jason .
RIZZO: Go !
BOEMAN: Hurry !
DELONGPRE: Faster ! Do n't we have another gun ?
JANESSA: They 're not gon na make it . Close the doo efore he gets us all .
DELONGPRE: They 'll make it .
JANESSA: Close the fucking door !
DELONGPRE: NO !
DELONGPRE: Get ready to blow it . Rizzo dives , slides under the closing door .
BRODSKI: Damage ? Boeman climbs to a console .
BOEMAN: Minimal .
RIZZO: We made it ?
DELONGPRE: I thinkI think maybe we did .
THORGAN: Kay-Em we made it !
BOEMAN: I 've changed the course for Earth II . And I sent a distress signal .
VOICE: Copy that Grendel . Rescue enroute . You should hit EARTH II orbit in fifteen minutes . Rescue ETA twenty minutes .
BOEMAN: We 're going home people . More CHEERS . Rizzo turns to find Delonpre staring at her .
DELONGPRE: See ? We 're not so bad .
RIZZO: Not so bad .
BOEMAN: This way !
BOEMAN: The pressures cause the engines to overheat ! Hurry ! Delongpre helps Rizzo and Thorgan to safety .
JANESSA: Pull me in !
BRODSKI: I 'm pulling , damnit !
BRODSKI: Well , that 's a shame .
RIZZO: Weapons ? All this technology and what good has it done ? !
DELONGPRE: It bought us some time .
BOEMAN: And now we 're all out of it .
RIZZO: Done ?
THORGAN: Kaboom .
DELONGPRE: Again ? ! Jesus !
RIZZO: Why am I not surprised ?
DELONGPRE: Then do it . The rescue ship can find us here right ?
BRODSKI: Ca n't shut em ' down from here .
BOEMAN: Somebody 's gon na have to go back to the engine room .
DELONGPRE: You ai n't catching my ass in there again .
BRODSKI: I 'll go . The kids give him the `` are you crazy ? '' stare .
BOEMAN: You 're too weak . I 'll go .
RIZZO: You know , this future shit sucks . I 'll fucking do it .
DELONGPRE: You ?
RIZZO: Wait around on your asses all day . I 'll need a distraction .
THORGAN: What kind of a distraction ?
THEN: RIZZO HEY !
RIZZO: You want some of me ?
DELONGPRE: Almost got it .
RIZZO: Delongpre ! Out of time !
DELONPRE: Got it !
DELONGPRE: Damn that was close !
RIZZO: Guys , he 's right behind us !
DELONGPRE: Okay ? ! !
BOEMAN: The docking bay was damaged after the explosion . Meet us at the airlock . INT . REACTOR ROOM corridor .
DELONGPRE: Got it . You ever space walked ?
RIZZO: Oh sure , all the time .
RIZZO: Damit , Thorgan , whatever you 're doing you 'd better hurry ! I hate the future !
THORGAN: Do n't worry . He ca n't see us . Rizzo glances out the docking bay window .
RIZZO: Is that ?
DELONGPRE: Earth II .
THORGAN: Kay-Em , you 've saved our lives , you know that do n't you ?
DELONGPRE: I knew you were a little sick , but Geez .
THORGAN: Goodbye , my love .
RIZZO: His mother was killed before his eyes . That 's what drove him insane . It 'll work .
RIZZO: Eat me .
WOMAN: Help me ! Jason help me !
MRS. VOORHEES: Help me , Jason , please ! Help your mother ! Jason moves closer .
DELONGPRE: Well , do something !
THORGAN: Shit !
BOEMAN: Just a little more time .
RIZZO: Thorgan ! ! ! ! He 's clicking away like a mad man .
DELONGPRE: Boeman , the ships not here .
BRODSKI: Yeee-Haaaaa ! ! Slowly they begin entering the atmosphere .
CHRISSIE: C'mon !
BRODY: How come the sun did n't used to shine in here ?
ELLEN: 'cause when we bought the house it was Autumn . This is summer . Feed the dogs .
BRODY: Right .
ELLEN: Do you see the kids ?
BRODY: Probably out in the back yard .
ELLEN: In Amity , you say 'Yahd . '
BRODY: The kids are in the yahd , playing near the cah . How 's that sound ?

ELLEN: Go upstairs and bring Mommy a band- aid .
BRODY: Oh , yeah . How do I look ? Older , huh ?
ELLEN: I think they make you look sexy .
BRODY: Sexy , hm ? What was I before ?
ELLEN: Older , sillier .
BRODY: I do n't want to depend on these things , y'know -– sometimes you can weaken your eyes .
ELLEN: There . What was that ? Michael heads toward the beach .
BRODY: The office .
ELLEN: Be careful .
BRODY: Here ? You got ta be kiddin ' .
ELLEN: Hey Chief . Bring my cup back .
BRODY: Christine what ?
CASSIDY: Worthingsly Worthington no one ever died on me before .
BRODY: You picked her up on the ferry .
CASSIDY: I did n't know her .
BRODY: And nobody else saw her in the water ?
CASSIDY: Somebody could 've I was sort of passed out .
BRODY: Think she might 've run out on you ?
CASSIDY: Oh , no , sir . I 've never had a woman do that . I 'm sure she drowned .
BRODY: You from around here ?
CASSIDY: No . Cambridge . Harvard . My family 's in Tuxedo , New York , though .
BRODY: You here for the summer ?
CASSIDY: Some friends and me took a house .
BRODY: What d'you pay for a place just fo the summer ?
CASSIDY: A thousand apiece , something like that . There 's five of us . And we each kick in a hundred a week fo eer and cleaning , stuff like that .
BRODY: Pretty stiff .
CASSIDY: You ca n't make me look !
BRODY: If this is going to work , you 've got to keep current stuff out here , and put 'closed ' files in there . The 'Pendings ' stay on my desk , okay ?
POLLY: This is in no order of importance , Chief There 's a meeting on the Amity Town Council on Aging this Monday night , Bentoncourt Hall . The Fire Inspector wants you to go over the fireworks site with him before he catches the one o'clock ferry . Mainly , you have a batch of calls about that new Karate school .
BRODY: Jesus , Santos .
POLLY: What 's the matter ?
BRODY: Polly , I want to know what wate ecreation is on for today .
POLLY: Right this minute ?
BRODY: Where 'd you hide the 'Beach Closed ' signs ?
HENDRICKS: We never had any . What 's the problem ? A local merchant comes through the door .
LOCAL MERCHANT: Glad I caught you . There 's a city truck with New Hampshire plates parked ight in front of my Brody pushes past him and out the door .
KEISEL: Wait-a-minute . Glasses , right ?
BRODY: Call me later in the day , okay , Harry ?
LYNWOOD: Stuff 's no good to me in August when the Pilgrims come in June Go on and help yourself to whateve you need , Chief . Can you work the egister ?
HENDRICKS: Polly told me to tell you there 's a scout troop in Avril Bay doing the mile swim for their Merit Badges . I could n't call them in , there 's no phone out there .
BRODY: Get out of there – take these back to the office and make up some 'Beach Closed ' signs , and let Polly do the printing .
HENDRICKS: What 's the matter with my printing ?
VAUGHN: What have you got there , Lenny ?
HENDRICKS: We had a shark attack at South Chop this morning , Mayor . Fatal . Got ta atten down the beach .
VAUGHN: Who 've you told this to , Lenny ?
HENDRICKS: I just found out about it but there 's a bunch of Boy Scouts in the water a coupla miles down the coast from where we found the girl . Avril Bay , thereabouts . Chief went to dry them off .
VAUGHN: Take my car , okay ? You come with us , Lenny .
HENDRICKS: I 've got all these signs here
VAUGHN: C'mon , it 'll give us time to think about what they 're going to say .
SCOUTMASTER: Let 's go , Robbie . You too , Hofner . Boyle , keep your head up . Alberts , keep kicking
VAUGHN: Martin ! Are you going to shut down the beach on your own authority ?
BRODY: Do I need any more authority ?
MEADOWS: Technically , you need the instruction of a civic ordinance , or a special meeting of the town selectmen
VAUGHN: That 's just going by the book . We 're just a little anxious that you 're ushing into something serious here . This is your first summer .
BRODY: Now tell me something I do n't know .
VAUGHN: All I 'm saying is that Amity is a summer town we need summer dollars , and if they ca n't swim here , they 'll use the beaches at Cape Cod , or Long Island .
BRODY: So we should set out a smorgasbord ?
MEADOWS: We 're not even sure what it was .
BRODY: What else could 've done that ?
VAUGHN: Boat propeller ?
DOCTOR: I think , possibly sure . A boating accident .
VAUGHN: Some weekend tramp accidentally goes swimming too far , she 's a little drunk , a fishing boat comes along
MEADOWS: Remember when Fred Ganz went scalloping in his BVD 's ? He was going to swim to New Bedford , he said .
BRODY: Doctor , you 're the one who told me what it was !
DOCTOR: I was wrong . We 'll have to amend the eport .
MEADOWS: We never had that kind of trouble here .
VAUGHN: I do n't think you can appreciate the gut reaction people have to these things .
BRODY: I was only reacting to what I was told .
VAUGHN: It 's all psychological , anyway . You yell 'Barracuda ' and everyone says 'huh ' . You yell 'Shark ' and we 've got a panic on our hands . I think we all agree we do n't need a panic this close to the 4th of July .
BRODY: I ca n't work in a vacuum . Why do n't you make Hendricks Chief ? His family 's een here since the Puritans half this island are his cousins .
VAUGHN: Martin , we hired the best man we could find . All ad lib agreement .
MEADOWS: You have our complete support .
VAUGHN: Now then . We 've got a vandalism problem we ought to talk about
SHOPKEEPER: Hello , Mr. Quint .
QUINT: Four spools of Number 12 piano wire , Okay ? I ordered them .
SHOPKEEPER: Yessir , right here . What do those fish do , eat this stuff ?
QUINT: They choke on it .
SHOPKEEPER: Bye now .
MAX TAFT: Looks like another big season . Gets worse every year .
MRS. TAFT: And none of them from the Island . Just a lot of bother .
BRODY: What ?
TAFT: Present company excepted , but off- islanders are a pain in the butt . Pardon my French .
ELLEN: What about this kid ? What if he were orn here . That make him an islander ?
TAFT: Just 'cause a cat has kittens in an oven , it do n't make them muffins .
SEAN: I 'm not a muffin ! I 'm a boy !
ALEX: Water . Just once more , please ?
ELLEN: Do you want the boys to come in ? Honey , if you 're worried
BRODY: How 's the water ?
KEISEL: Too cold . I 'm going in again Labo Day . Hope we get this weather next weekend .
ELLEN: You 're very tight , y'know ? Right there .
BRODY: Ow . He 's got ta be more careful in the water
DOG MAN: Buster ! Hey , Buster ! Here boy ! He continues to ad lib calling his dog , but there 's no answer , no dog in the water .
TOURIST: Something in the water . Right there ! Did n't anyone see it ?
WOMAN: There 's blood in the water .
ELLEN: What is it ?
BRODY: Michael ! Sean ! Out of the water . Everybody out of the water ! Michael ! Get out !
MEADOWS: I agree . If she 's going to advertise , I would n't recommend out-of-town papers . Amity people could take care of this .
BRODY: I 'm responsible for public safety around here
VAUGHN: Then go out tomorrow and make sure no one gets hurt . Everybody , could I have you attention ? Since this affects all of us , I suggest we move into council chambers , where there 's more room
DENHERDER: Is that $ 3000 bounty on the shark in cash or check ?
VAUGHN: That 's private business between you ave fishermen and Mrs. Kintner . Chief
BRODY: I 'd like to tell you what we 're doing so far . These are some of the steps I 've taken as Chief of Police
MEADOWS: What 's going on with the beaches , Chief ? All react .
BRODY: I 'll get to that in a minute . First , I plan to start our seasonal summe help early , and to use shark spotters on beaches open to the sea . I 'd like cooperation from local fishermen , and I 've also contacted the Oceanographic Institute over on the mainland .
VAUGHN: No need to involve outsiders in ou usiness , Martin .
WOMAN: Are you going to close the beaches ?
BRODY: Larry and I have also decided to close the beaches for a short time .
VAUGHN: Only 24 hours !
BRODY: I did n't agree to that !
MRS. TAFT: That official business could take all summer !
MR. KEISEL: Maybe it 's better to close .
MR. WISEMAN: We should make sure there is no danger .
MR. HASSETT: I did n't raise my kids to be some fish 's lunch !
MRS. TAFT: The motel is all I own you pull the plug on this town and I go down the drain with it .
MR. POSNER: Nobody 's seen a shark .
MR. POLK: We 'll lose business , we lose taxes , we lose ou shirts !
QUINT: You all know me . You know what I do for a living . I 'll go out and get this bird for you . He 's a bad one and it 's not like goin ' down the pond chasing blue-gills and tommy- cods . This is a fish that can swallow a man whole . A little shakin ' , a little tenderizing and down ya ' go . You got ta get this fellow and get him quick . If you do , it 'll bring a lot of tourist business just to see him and you 've got your business ack on a paying basis . A shark of that size is no pleasure and I value my neck at a hell of a lot more ' n 3,000 bucks . I 'll find him for three . But I 'll kill him for ten . Crowd reaction .
VAUGHN: Thank you very much , Mr. Quint , the Selectmen will take your offer unde advisement
ELLEN: Can you stand something to eat ?
BRODY: Love a cup of tea . With lemon .
ELLEN: Mikey loves his birthday present .
BRODY: Where is he ?
ELLEN: He 's sitting in it .
BRODY: Son ! Out of the water now !
MICHAEL: My boat 's neat , dad !
BRODY: I want him out of the ocean .
ELLEN: It 's three feet deep , Martin
BRODY: Michael ! Come inside !
ELLEN: It 's his birthday present , and you closed the beach , Honey . I told him not to go in the water after what happened yesterday . I do n't believe he 'll ever do it again .
BRODY: I told him not to go out until he memorized the handbook and the safety safety regulations , until he was sure of himself
ELLEN: You heard your father ! Out right now !
DENHERDER: You wan na call it a night after here ?
CHARLIE: It 's only two-thirty . What , are you tired ?
DENHERDER: Yeah , Charlie , I got my second wind three nibbles back .
CHARLIE: Screw lamb let 's shoot the sirloin !
DENHERDER: We 're blowin ' half the bounty on ait
CHARLIE: Set ?
DENHERDER: You do this all the time , right , Charlie ?
CHARLIE: Twenty years .
DENHERDER: I ca n't believe that people pay money to go fishing . This is really dumb . This is n't even relaxing it 's just boring .
CHARLIE: Look at him take it !
DENHERDER: Do I set the goddam hook ?
CHARLIE: Let him do it ! Go-go-go-go-go !
DENHERDER: CHARLIE ! JUMP !
CHARLIE: Holy Jesus Christ !
DENHERDER: Get the hell out ! Charlie ! Swim !
HENDRICKS: So then Denherder and Charlie sat there trying to catch their breath , and figuring out how to explain to Charlie 's wife what happened to he freezer full of meat .
BRODY: That was n't funny .
HENDRICKS: Mrs. Kintner must 've put her ad in Field and Stream .
BRODY: Looks more like the readers of the National Enquirer .
HOOPER: Hello .
GARDNER: Hello , back .
BRODY: You going out too , Ben ?
GARDNER: Might give it a try . That three thousand bounty beats working for a living . We ready ?
BRODY: Just back up ! No , the other way ! Cut it to your left ! Your other left ! The big boat , your front end is out way too far . Little boat , stay still !
HOOPER: Ahoy , sail ! You got an oar ? Well , scull it out !
SAILBOAT SKIPPER: Tell that stinkpotter to belay !
MOTORBOAT SKIPPER: Tell that ragsetter I 'm going to poke him in the snoot !
HOOPER: Just cast off in turn and make fo the channel , OK ?
BRODY: Thanks .
HOOPER: Excuse me , I wonder if you could tell me
BRODY: If that 's dynamite , give it here , o do n't leave port .
MAN: Aw , c'mon , it 's just fireworks . Sharks like fireworks , it attracts them .
BRODY: Hand it over .
HOOPER: There 's a fantail launch out there that wo n't make it beyond the eakwater .
BRODY: You 're tellin ' me . I swear , this town has gone crazy .
HOOPER: Officer , I wonder if you could tell me where I could find Chief Brody ?
BRODY: Who are you ?
HOOPER: Hooper , Matt Hooper . From the Oceanographic Institute .
PRATT: Well , get over there ! He ai n't caught it yet !
PRATT: Hand me that pole ! Quick !
HARRY: Beat it ! I hooked him !
PRATT: How 's the family , Harry ? Go on and do it !
HARRY: Let go my shark !
BRODY: Let 's show Mr. Hooper our accident .
HOOPER: Victim One , identified as Christine Watkins , female Caucasian
BRODY: No , it was local jurisdiction .
HOOPER: Left arm , head , shoulders , sternum and portions of ribcage intact . Please do n't smoke . With minor post- mortem lacerations and abrasions . Bite marks indicate typical non-frenzy feeding pattern of large squali , possibly carchaninus lonimanus , o isurus glaucas . Gross tissue loss and post-mortem erosion of bite surfaces prevent detailed analysis ; however , teeth and jaws of the attacking squali must be considered above average for these waters . Did you go out in a boat and look around ?
BRODY: No , we just checked the beach
HOOPER: It was n't an 'accident , ' it was n't a oat propeller , or a coral reef , o Jack the Ripper . It was a shark . It was a shark .
MEADOWS: Ginny , get this out on the state wire to AP and UPI in Boston and New York . Have one of them pick it up for the national and call Dave Axelrod in New York and tell him this is from me and he owes me one let 's get a picture .
HOOPER: Well , if one man can catch a fish in 50 days , then I guess 50 of these ozos can catch a fish in one day eginner 's luck .
BRODY: You did it ! Did Ben Gardner catch this ?
MEADOWS: Okay , everybody , I want to get a picture for the paper could everyone clear out of the way ?
HOOPER: Who , me ? Okay
BRODY: Larry , if you 'd see these clowns leave , you 'd never believe they 'd come back with anything . But they got him !
VAUGHN: That 's good . That 's real good . Ben Meadows getting pictures for the paper .
BRODY: Sure he is .
VAUGHN: Who 's that young man ?
BRODY: Matt Hooper , the specialist they send down from the Oceanographic Institute .
VAUGHN: I think we all owe a debt of gratitude to these men for catching this monster .
PRATT: Whadya mean , 'Bite Radius ? ' What 's that ?
GAFFER: Teeth are teeth , right ?
HOOPER: I did n't say this was n't the shark , I just said I was n't sure this was the one
BRODY: What d'ya mean ?
HOOPER: There are hundreds of different kinds of sharks ; makos , blues , hammerheads , white-tips any one of them could 've attacked . Look shark digestion is slow . We could open this one up , and find whatever he 's been eating is still inside .
VAUGHN: That 's disgusting ! This is the largest , meanest , most vicious shark ever landed off Amity Island , and a known maneater !
HOOPER: Let 's just cut him open and see what 's inside
BRODY: Why not , Larry ? We could get a positive confirmation that way .
VAUGHN: Be reasonable , boys this is n't the time or the place to do some kind of half-assed autopsy on a fish . Ben do you have all the pictures you need ?
MEADOWS: Plenty .
HOOPER: Wait a minute
VAUGHN: I am not going to stand here and watch this fish cut open and see some kid fall out on the dock . Besides
HOOPER: Look , maybe this is the wrong time to pursue this , but I 'm not sure
BRODY: She 's right .
VAUGHN: Let 's all get out of here , this place stinks .
BRODY: I 'm going home .
SEAN: Why ?
BRODY: Because he needs it .
HOOPER: Hi . I 'm Matt Hooper . If your husband is here , I 'd like to talk to him .
ELLEN: So would I . Come on in .
HOOPER: Is anyone having this ?
BRODY: Swell .
HOOPER: Here one red , one white .
ELLEN: My husband tells me you 're in sharks .
HOOPER: I would n't put it that way . But I love sharks .
ELLEN: You love sharks ?
HOOPER: I do . But you 've still got a problem here , there 's a shark just off the island somewhere .
BRODY: How come you have to tell them that ?
ELLEN: Excuse me , but what are you talking about ? Did n't they catch the shark this afternoon ? It was on the Cape station news .
HOOPER: They caught a shark , not the shark . Big difference . I could 've proved it this afternoon , by cutting that one open and examining his stomach contents . Also , his bite was too small . Brody has the cork out of the wine . Pop .
BRODY: Let 's all have a drink .
ELLEN: Thank you .
HOOPER: Here 's to your husband , the only other rational man on the island . Day after tomorrow , I 'll be gone , and he 'll be the only one .
ELLEN: You 're leaving ?
HOOPER: Going out on the 'Aurora . '
ELLEN: Is that a boat ?
HOOPER: Is it ! The best-funded research expedition to ever study the shark around the world in 18 months .
ELLEN: Like those Cousteau specials on television ? I think it 's for the kids , but I love them .
HOOPER: Better than Cousteau , or Compagno with computers , telemetry , Defense Department funding
ELLEN: I saw a show with sea otters , and a ig turtle Mikey loved it . Made me promise to get him one . Will you live on the boat ?
HOOPER: Yep .
ELLEN: Martin hates boats . Hates the water . On the ferry to the mainland , he sits in the car the whole way over . He 's got this childhood thing , there 's a clinical word for it .
BRODY: Drowning . Lem me ask you something . Is it true most attacks take place in three feet of water , around 10 feet from the beach ?
HOOPER: Yeah . Like the kid on your beach . I wish I could 've examined that shark they caught
BRODY: Something else . Do most attacks go unreported ?
HOOPER: About half of them . A lot of 'missing swimmers ' are really shark victims .
BRODY: There 's a kind of a lone shark , called , uh
HOOPER: Rogue ?
BRODY: Yeah . Rogue . Picks out an area where there 's food and hangs out there as long as the food supply lasts ?
HOOPER: It 's called Territoriality . It 's a theory .
BRODY: And before 1900 , when people first starting swimming for recreation , efore public bathing and resorts , there were very few shark attacks , cause sharks did n't know what they were missing ?
HOOPER: You could say that .
BRODY: Why do n't we have one more drink , you and I , and then we go down and cut open that old shark and see fo sure what 's inside him , or not .
ELLEN: Can you do that ?
BRODY: I am Chief of Police . I can do anything I want . You want to come ?
HOOPER: I 'm flattered you should ask .
BRODY: What stinks so bad ?
HOOPER: Our friend , the shark .
BRODY: What 's that ?
HOOPER: Half a flounder . Hmmm a burlap ag a paint can aha !
BRODY: What ? What ? !
HOOPER: Just as I thought . He drifted up here with the Gulf Stream , from southern waters .
BRODY: How can you tell ?
HOOPER: Florida license plate .
BRODY: He ate a car ?
HOOPER: No , but Tiger sharks are the garbage cans of the ocean . They eat anything . But this one did n't eat any people . There 's nothing here He kicks the remains around below camera .
BRODY: What do we do ?
HOOPER: If you 're looking for a shark , you do n't look on land . You go out and chum for him .
BRODY: Chum ?
HOOPER: Only one sure way to find him offer him a little something to eat . Chum blood , waste meat , fish , anything . They can sense it miles away . If he 's out there , we might be able to get a closer look at him . It 's a good time , too . They 're night feeders
BRODY: What is all this stuff ?
HOOPER: Depth-finder , fathometer , sonar , closed-circuit TV fore and aft RDF , single side band And two loose nuts behind the wheel .
BRODY: Can you tell from that if a big man- eater is around ?
HOOPER: Sometimes . Look here something big , probably a school of mackerel clumped together . And staying right with us .
BRODY: Where 'd you get all this ?
HOOPER: I Bought it . Both sets of grandparents set up trust funds fo me ; stocks went up , so I do n't have to touch my principal .
BRODY: You 're at the Institute full time ? Or do you have a job ?
HOOPER: It is a job . I 'm not fooling around like some amateur . It 's my life !
BRODY: We got ta get back soon
BRODY: What happened ?
HOOPER: I want to check something . Hold my feet .
BRODY: Do n't they have lifejackets o something ? An extra boat ?
HOOPER: They must 've hit something .
BRODY: Why do n't we just tow it in ?
HOOPER: We will . There 's something I 've got to find out .
BRODY: Be careful , for chrissake .
HOOPER: A White ! A Great White , I found a tooth buried in the hull . He must 've attacked I knew it Gardner 's dead in there . I did n't see the mate
BRODY: No shark did that to a boat !
HOOPER: Jesus Christ ! A Great White ! Who 'd elieve it ! We 're not talking about a shark , we 're talking about a Shark !
BRODY: There is a kind of shark called a Great White Shark that every expert in the world agrees is a maneater .
HOOPER: You 're situation here suggests that a Great White has staked out a claim in the waters around Amity Island , and that he will continue to feed here as long as there is food in the water .
BRODY: There 's no limits to where he can strike , and we 've had three attacks and two deaths in the past few days . It happened like this before , in 1916 , when a Great White killed five swimmers at Jones Beach , in Long Island .
HOOPER: A shark 's attack is stimulated by the kind of splashing and activity that occurs whenever humans go swimming you ca n't avoid it !
BRODY: A 4th of July beach is like ringing a dinner bell , for Chrissake !
HOOPER: I just pulled a shark tooth the size of a shot glass out of the hull of a wrecked boat out there .
BRODY: We towed Ben Gardner 's boat in , Larry ; he was dead and his boat was all chewed up .
VAUGHN: Is that tooth here ? Did anyone see it ?
HOOPER: I do n't have it .
BRODY: He lost it on the way up .
VAUGHN: What kind of a shark did you say it was ?
HOOPER: Carcaradon carcharias . A Great White .
VAUGHN: Well , I 'm not going to commit economic suicide on that flimsy evidence . We depend on the summer people for ou lives , and if our beaches are closed , then we 're all finished .
BRODY: We have got to close the beaches . We have got to get someone to kill the shark , we need non-corrosive mesh netting , we need scientific support It 's gon na cost money just to keep the nuts out and save what we have .
VAUGHN: I do n't thing either of you is familiar with our problems
HOOPER: I 'm familiar with the fact that you are going to ignore this thing until it swims up and bites you on the ass ! There are only two ways to solve this thing you can kill it , or you can cut off its food supply
BRODY: That means closing the beaches .
VAUGHN: Come here , I want to show you something .
HOOPER: That 's it ! I 'm standing here arguing with a guy who ca n't wait to be a hot lunch . Goodbye .
BRODY: Wait a minute ! I need you .
HOOPER: Out there is a Perfect Engine , an Eating Machine that is a miracle of evolution it swims and eats and that 's all . Look at that ! Those proportions are correct . I know sharks .
VAUGHN: You 'd love to prove that . Getting your name in the National Geographic .
BRODY: Larry , we can re-open the beaches in August .
VAUGHN: August ! Tomorrow is the 4th of July , and we are going to open for business . It 's going to be our best summer in years . If you 're so concerned about the beaches , you two , you do whateve you have to to keep them safe , but with you or without you , the beaches stay open this weekend .
OFFICER: Martin Brody ? I 'll need your signature here here and here .
BRODY: What is this ?
OFFICER: Authorization for direct payment of flight expenses not directly connected to a normal mission of this command . You pay for the gas .
BRODY: I signed on the wrong line
OFFICER: Just erase your signature and initial your erasure .
BRODY: I want to thank you guys from local agencies for cooperating , and I hope we wo n't actually be needing you services . But I 'm glad to have you here .
ENSIGN: I want to get our lines and repellent out , so we better shove off .
BRODY: We 're all on one channel , so let 's keep radio traffic to a minimum , okay ? Everyone kind of nods acknowledgment .
HOOPER: I hope we get some more help .
BRODY: I wish it would rain
TV DIRECTOR: Put 1 on the line . In five . 4 . 3 . 2 . 1 . Roll .
ANNOUNCER: and with me is the Mayor of Amity , Lawrence Vaughn . Mr. Vaughn , how about those rumors ?
VAUGHN: How about them indeed . I 'm pleased and happy to repeat the news that we have , in fact , caught and killed a large predator that supposedly injured some bathers here . As you can see , it 's a beautiful day , the beaches are open , and the folks here are having a wonderful time . Amity , y'know , means 'Friendship . '
ANNOUNCER: Also here today is a Marine Biologist and Research Fellow from the Oceanographic Institute , Matthew Hooper . Mr. Hooper , what 've you heard ?
HOOPER: What I 've heard and what I 've seen are two different things . I believe there is a large Great White Shark Carcharodon Cacharias - in the waters off this very beach , that he has killed and that he will kill again
ANNOUNCER: And there you have it two different opinions , by men of good will . The holiday crowd here at Amity seems to e making up its own mind
BRODY: I 'm sorry , I just do n't have the time .
TV DIRECTOR: Recue the machines . 2 , pan off the Chief and show me some tits and ass . 1 , get me some cute kids . 3 see if you got a shot at the water .

VAUGHN: I do n't know if I can do that without a
BRODY: I 'm going to hire Quint to kill the fish . I want to see that shark dead .
VAUGHN: Maybe we can save August
BRODY: Forget it . This summer 's had it . Next summer 's had it . You 're the mayor of Shark City . You wanted to keep the beaches open . What happens when the town finds out about that ?
VAUGHN: I was acting in the town 's best interests
BRODY: The best interest in this town would e to see that fish belly-up in the water with a hole in his head . You do the right thing . You authorize me . Right there . Whatever it costs .
VAUGHN: My kids were on that beach
BRODY: Just sign it , Larry .
HOOPER: This is quite a place .
QUINT: Did you bring a check ?
BRODY: What ?
QUINT: Cash ? Or do we do this on a handshake and a promise ?

QUINT: This is the last time I hear from you . I do n't want anyone with piss for blood on my vessel . Put that lackfish on board , pump the bilges , and top off the fuel tanks , and finish up in the morning . Then you 're on the beach .
HOOPER: You 're going to need an extra hand
BRODY: This is Matt Hooper
QUINT: I know who he is
BRODY: He 's from the Oceanographic Institute .
HOOPER: I 've been to sea since I was 12 . I 've crewed three Trans-pacs
QUINT: Transplants ?
HOOPER: and an America 's Cup Trials
QUINT: I 'm not talking about day sailing o pleasure boating . I 'm talking about working for a living . Sharking .
HOOPER: And I 'm not talking about hooking some poor dogfish or sand shark . I 'm talking about a Great White .
QUINT: Are you now . I know about porkers in the water Here . Tie me a sheepshank . Hooper ties the knot effortlessly .
HOOPER: I do n't need to pass basic seamanship .
QUINT: Let me see your hands

HOOPER: I 'll see ya . Tell Dorothy hello . Hooper sees his gear approaching .
QUINT: Hello , Junior . What are you ? Some kind of half-assed astronaut ? Jesus Christ , when I was a kid , every little squirt wanted to be a harpoone or a sword fisherman . What d'ya have there a portable shower ?
HOOPER: Anti-Shark cage .
QUINT: Who 's inside , you or the shark ? Hooper indicates `` me . ''
HOOPER: Comin ' aboard
ELLEN: Did you take your dramamine ? Here .
QUINT: Hurry up , Chief , daylight 's a wastin ' .
ELLEN: Is that him ?
BRODY: Colorful , is n't he ?
ELLEN: You going to be all right ?
BRODY: Nothing to worry about I 'll survive this .
ELLEN: I 'll see you back soon . There 's an extra pair of glasses in your black socks , and there 's some suntan lotion and blistex in your kit .
BRODY: Yo-ho-ho and a bottle of rum .
ELLEN: What 'll I tell the kids ?
BRODY: Tell 'em I went fishin ' !
QUINT: Cast off the bow line ! Now your stern !
QUINT: Go ahead , you cannibals . Tell 'em where you got it !
HOOPER: What 's that supposed to prove ?
QUINT: Just a little appetizer . I want ou porker to know we 're serving . I want to put some iron into that big yap
BRODY: Who 's driving the boat ?
QUINT: Nobody . We 're drifting with the current .
HOOPER: Nothing . Nothing , nothing , nothing .
QUINT: Hell , in the old days we went out with good charts , good sounding lead , and a damn good compass . Nowadays , these kids are afraid to go out without depth finders , radar , radio , electric toothbrush , every stupid thing
HOOPER: Watch it ! Compressed air you screw around with one of those and Boom ! Careful , huh ?
QUINT: Real fine stuff but it wo n't mean a thing to Mr. Whitey , of course he did n't go to schools in electronics . He was born with what he does best . Eat . He 's a swimming appetite . 'Course he might eat this stuff , but then I 've seen him eat a rocking chair , too . Next time , ask me .
HOOPER: That 's pilot whale , is n't it ?
QUINT: It ai n't a Big Mac . The expert do n't approve . What do you thing ? You 're closer to the situation .
BRODY: Why are we way out here , when the shark 's back there ?
QUINT: 'cause this is where he lives . You got ta think like they do .
HOOPER: Easy for you they got a brain the size of a radish .
QUINT: Now if he were n't around , we 'd of hooked something else by now , would n't we ? But he scared 'em all away . Big lonesome son of a bitch
QUINT: he 'll gulp it down now Hooooooo !
BRODY: You got it ?
QUINT: Get behind me , dummy ! Reverse her and turn he 's taking too much line ! Wet my reel , quick !
HOOPER: Aye , Aye SIR . Stand by to repel oarders . Poop the mainsail . Argh , Jim Boy .
QUINT: Neutral ! Where the hell is he going ? Quint reeling in like mad .
HOOPER: Let it go , do n't waste your time .
QUINT: Down here , Hooper ! Hooper is rushing down .
HOOPER: I do n't know what it is , but it 's not a shark .
QUINT: Look you may be a big Yahoo in the lab , but out here you 're just supercargo , and you 'll do as I say , or you can take your gear and ackstroke home . Now get down here !
BRODY: The wire 's showing !
QUINT: Unbuckle me fast ! Grab the leader . He ai n't normal , this one they never
HOOPER: It 's too wild , too erratic . It 's a marlin or a stingray . It 's a gamefish .
QUINT: Watch your hands Grab onto this !
HOOPER: I 'm okay
QUINT: Fasten the pole .
BRODY: What 's the point with hooks and Lines ?
QUINT: Do n't tell me my business ! Quarter-mile , that way . Full throttle .
BRODY: How if they 're gon na keep on eaking ?
QUINT: What I do is trick him to the surface , got that ? Then I can jab him , understand ? Think I 'm gon na haul it in as if he 's a catfish , like everyone else does ? Brody goes inside to inspect his forehead .
HOOPER: What do you see ?
QUINT: At least you handle the boat all ight . Stop . Here Cut the engine .
HOOPER: 20 feet , if it 's an inch
QUINT: 25 feet . And three tons of him there .
BRODY: What do we do ? Get some help ? Radio in ?
HOOPER: There 's a formula ! Girth , about 150 inches , squared , divide by 800 son of a bitch , they are not going to believe this ! divide by 2000 three tons ! You 're right , you old fart ! Three tons !
QUINT: Orca here .
ELLEN'S VOICE: push this ? Oh . It 's working . Hello , Martin ?
QUINT: This is Quint , Missus .
ELLEN'S VOICE: I just wanted to know if you were all right the Coast Guard let me use their radio . Is Chief Brody there ?
QUINT: He 's busy .
ELLEN'S VOICE: Well is everything all right ?
QUINT: Just fine , Missus . We 'll be back soon . Everything 's fine . We have n't seen anything yet . Orca out .
HOOPER: Damn it ! I need something in the foreground to give it some scale . Martin ! Stand here ! No , to your left !

HOOPER: Rig another keg ! I 'm bringing he around !
BRODY: Why do n't we go in ? Get another crack at him tomorrow .
QUINT: We got a barrel on him . We ca n't lose him . We stay out here until we find him .
BRODY: Let 's call in we can radio and have a big boat here in an hour
QUINT: You hired me , remember ? It 's my $ 10,000 . It 's my shark
HOOPER: Look here . Steve Kaplan bit me during recess .
QUINT: Wire burn . Trying to stop a backstay from taking my head off .
HOOPER: Moray Eel . Bit right through a wet suit .
QUINT: Face and head scars come from amateu amusements in the bar room . This love line here that 's from some crazy Frenchie come after me with a knife . I caught him with a good right hand right in the snot locker and laid him amongst the sweetpeas .
HOOPER: Ever see one like this ?
QUINT: Nothing ! A pleasure scar . Look here He starts rolling up his own dirty pants leg .
HOOPER: I 'll drink to your leg .
QUINT: And I 'll drink to yours .
HOOPER: I think I can top that , Mister
QUINT: And here 's to the ladies . And here 's to their sisters ; I 'd rather one Miss than a shipload of Misters . He drinks , Hooper follows .
BRODY: C'mon . Middle appendix
QUINT: I almost had 'im .
BRODY: What 's that one , there ?
QUINT: Tattoo . Had it taken off .
HOOPER: Do n't tell me 'Death Before Dishonor . ' 'Mother . ' 'Semper Fi . ' Uhhh 'Do n't Tread on Me . ' C'mon what ?
QUINT: ' U.S.S Indianapolis . ' 1944 .
BRODY: What 's that , a ship ?
HOOPER: You were on the Indianapolis ? In '45 ? Jesus Quint remembering .
QUINT: Yeah . The U.S.S . Indianapolis . June 29th , 1945 , three and a half minutes past midnight , two torpedoes from a Japanese submarine slammed into our side . Two or three . We was still under sealed orders afte deliverin ' the bombthe Hiroshima ombwe was goin ' back across the Pacific from Tinian to Leyte . Damn near eleven hundred men went ove the side . The life boats was lashed down so tight to make the bomb run we could n't cut a single one adrift . Not one . And there was no rafts . None . That vessel sank in twelve minutes . Yes , that 's all she took . We did n't see the first shark till we 'd been in the water about an hour . A thirteen-footer near enough . A lue . You measure that by judgin ' the dorsal to the tail . What we did n't know of course the Captain knewI guess some officers knew was the omb mission had been so secret , no distress signals was sent . What the men did n't know was that they would n't even list us as overdue for a week . Well , I did n't know that I was n't an officer just as well perhaps . So some of us were dead already in the water just hangin ' limp in our lifejackets . And several already leedin ' . And the three hundred o so laying on the bottom of the ocean . As the light went , the sharks came crusin ' . We formed tight groups somewhat like squares in an old battle You know what I mean so that when one come close , the man nearest would yell and shout and pound the wate and sometimes it worked and the fish turned away , but other times that shark would seem to look right at a man right into his eyes and in spite of all shoutin ' and poundin ' you 'd hear that terrible high screamin ' and the ocean would go ed , then churn up as they ripped him . Then we 'd reform our little squares . By the first dawn the sharks had taken more than a hundred . Hard for me to count but more than a hundred . I do n't know how many sharks . Maybe a thousand . I do know they averaged six men an hour . All kinds lues , makos , tigers . All kinds . In the middle of the second day , some of us started to go crazy from the thirst . One fella cried out he saw a river , another claimed he saw a waterfall , some started to drink the ocean and choked on it , and some left our little groups our little squares and swam off alone lookin ' for islands and the sharks always took them right away . It was mainly the young fellas that did that the older ones stayed where they was . That second day my life jacket ubbed me raw and that was more blood in the water . Oh my . On Thursday morning I bumped up against a friend of mine Herbie Robinson from Cleveland a bosun 's mate it seemed he was asleep but when I eached over to waken him , he bobbed in the water and I saw his body upend ecause he 'd been bitten in half eneath the waist . Well Chief , so it went on bombers high overhead but nobody noticin ' us . Yes suicides , sharks , and all this goin ' crazy and dyin ' of thirst . Noon the fifth day , Mr. Hooper , a Lockheed Ventura swung around and came in low . Yes . He did that . Yes , that pilot saw us . And early evenin ' , a big fat PBY come down out of the sky and began the pickup . That was when I was most frightened of all while I was waitin ' for my turn . Just two and a half hours short of five days and five nights when they got to me and took me up . Eleven hundred of us went into that ocean three hundred and sixteen got out . Yeah . Nineteen hundred and forty five . June the 29th . Anyway , we delivered the bomb .
BRODY: What the hell ?
HOOPER: It 's a whale out there .
QUINT: Show me the way to go home I 'm tired and I want to go to bed . I had a little drink about an hour ago , and it went right to my head .
BRODY: Where ?
QUINT: The bilge pumps . There
HOOPER: Rudder bearings ?

BRODY: That 's it ! Radio in for help !
QUINT: Shut up ! Just pump her out !
BRODY: Yeah , Captain , as soon as I make a call . Brody heads for the radio in the pilot house .
QUINT: Duty first and pleasure after
BRODY: Some great idea ! Now where are we ? Some goddamn skipper you are . You 're certifiable , y'know that ? You 're a eal treat ! Certifiable ! Bananas !
HOOPER: Coming right to us !
QUINT: No comin ' right at us ! Slow ahead , he 'll hit us head on Slower ! Throttle back -
BRODY: Did you get him in the head ?
QUINT: No ! No ! No ! Swing around ! After him !
HOOPER: We ca n't rev it up this high
QUINT: Watch it ! Hooper skillfully avoids the speeding rope .
HOOPER: Do n't shoot him any more ! He 's crazy on his own blood already !
BRODY: I ca n't stand here doing nothing !
QUINT: Order in the court !
BRODY: What about us ?
QUINT: Have to pump her steady , s'all .
BRODY: Where 'd he go ?

BRODY: You got ta go in the water

TINA: Double nope !
ANDY: Why 'd they decide to move ?
BROOKE: Too hot in the lighthouse ?
MIKE: Too hot for those two ? I ca n't believe it .
JACKIE: Is there something I do n't know about ?
BROOKE: I told you , remember ?
JACKIE: Oh , yeah . So why are n't they doing it now ? There 's a little round of giggling .
ANDY: Maybe by now they are .
MIKE: They 're moving pretty fast .
JACKIE: He 's cute
TINA: Yech !
BRODY: As soon as I heard about it , I called you . This thing is big ! His arms indicate big .
ELKINS: After we 've looked , we 'll talk .
HENDRICKS: This is it .
BRODY: See ? What 'd I tell you ?
ELKINS: First things first .
BRODY: Come on , let 's check the bite radius .
ELKINS: The what ?
BRODY: Bite radius . You know , the size of the mouth ?
ELKINS: The whale 's mouth ?
BRODY: The Shark 's mouth .
ELKINS: What shark ?
BRODY: The shark that did this . It was a shark , was n't it ?
ELKINS: We do n't know that , do we ?
BRODY: But that 's what we 're here to find out , right ?
ELKINS: You do n't tell me my job , and I wo n't tell you about yours , okay ?
HENDRICKS: I ca n't hear you if you 're going to whisper .
MIKE: Can we go now ?
BRODY: You stay here a minute .
MIKE: Oh , c'mon .
BRODY: You heard me .
JACKIE: We 'll be over by the lighthouse .
MIKE: I 'll be right there . Wait up .
ELKINS: Could be a shark . But maybe not .
BRODY: Look , I know a little bit about sharks .
ELKINS: Do you ?
BRODY: I know that this was probably a Great White Shark . Car-cadon Caradan He fumbles for the correct Latin .
ELKINS: Carcharadon Carcharias .
BRODY: That 's it .
ELKINS: Okay , so that 's it .
BRODY: Is there one in these waters ?
ELKINS: What makes you think there might be ?
BRODY: Because this big fish has been bitten y some other big fish
ELKINS: This is a mammal , not a fish .
BRODY: Jesus , do n't quibble with me . I want to know if a Great White Shark did this .
ELKINS: Probably .
BRODY: That 's it ? Probably ? Look , sharks are attracted by blood , and thrashing around
ELKINS: And sound .
BRODY: Sound ?
ELKINS: Sound . Like sonar , or radar . They home in on irregular sounds , unusual sounds , any rhythmic low-frequency vibration .
BRODY: So there 's one around here .
ELKINS: Not necessarily . These wounds could 've een inflicted 30 miles out to sea , or more . None of them are immediately fatal . Currents could 've carried the ody 10 miles further .
HENDRICKS: We got a helluva tide this month .
BRODY: Could you just keep that crowd back , please ?
MIKE: Pop
BRODY: You stay right here . You 're going in with me .
MIKE: We came out in my boat .
BRODY: Andy can sail in it .
MIKE: I got a date !
BRODY: She 'll understand .
MIKE: She wo n't .
ELKINS: Lower jaw displaced and lacerated by predato attempt to seize the tongue . Additional large tissue loss in the dorsal and sub- dorsal areas , as well as the caudal . Oriamal bite adius 37 inches , allowing for salt-water erosion and subsequent small predato and scavenger tissue attacks
BRODY: I do n't want to discuss it . Elkins crosses to Brody .
ELKINS: It 's either a Great White , or anothe killer whale .
BRODY: Ca n't you tell ?
ELKINS: Not when it 's like this . This animal has been ashore for 10 , 12 hours , and drifting for a day , at least . Every little nibbler in the sea 's taken a bite .
BRODY: Look can Great White Sharks communicate ? Send out signals , o something ? You know , take revenge , sense an enemy
ELKINS: Do n't be ridiculous Sharks do n't take things personally .
MIKE: Dad , please
BRODY: No more sailing . You come back with me , and that 's it .
MIKE: Why me ?
BRODY: Because I say so .
ANDY: I 'll tie up at the town dock , do n't worry , man .
JACKIE: See you later , Mikey
VAUGHN: I 'm showing summer rentals . We got a helluva season going .
BRODY: We have got to talk , and we have got to talk alone .
VAUGHN: We 're alone .
BRODY: Larry , I do n't know how to say this , ut I think we got a shark problem . A real one .
VAUGHN: Are you serious ?
BRODY: Of course . Look I 've got some missing persons , fatalities , evidence of a large predator
VAUGHN: No one has seen a shark no fin , no bites , nothing . Be realistic .
BRODY: I got a feeling . I have to act on it you can understand that , ca n't you ?
VAUGHN: Of course I can , but ca n't it wait ? These things cost money , and this town does n't have much money .
BRODY: We have to do something .
VAUGHN: We have done something hell , we damn near went broke putting up a shark watch tower on the beach it 's the only one in 2000 miles , y'know .
BRODY: I know , I know
VAUGHN: And I stood by while you told the people from Ramada and Marriott that if they put up a hotel they 'd need $ 800,000 worth of steel net around their beaches ! In New England ? We all lost on that one .
BRODY: It 's still a good idea .
VAUGHN: Martin , when we build up our tax ase a little , you can have everything you want ; right now , the town 's broke .
BRODY: Please , Larry there 's good reason . Those water skiers
VAUGHN: A tragedy . But that was a boating accident ; no bites , no sharks , nothing ut a boating accident .
BRODY: Two of them are still missing !
VAUGHN: There 's always deaths in these waters that never turn up . Are they all shark victims ?
BRODY: Maybe they are !
VAUGHN: Bullshit .
BRODY: Bullshit ? I 'll give you bullshit there 's a dead whale out there with ites all over it !
VAUGHN: What am I , an ass ? When you called me , I called Elkins , and her bosses . Nothing she saw is proof of anything .
BRODY: Someone has to do something .
VAUGHN: Do n't push it this time . If you do , it wo n't turn out the way you want , I guarantee you that .
BRODY: Come on , give a guy a break .
HENDRICKS: Chief ?
BRODY: In here .
HENDRICKS: I missed you at the funeral home . Santos said you were here .
BRODY: You did n't miss much . Christ , what a mess .
HENDRICKS: Positive I.D . ?
BRODY: The woman passenger on the boat that lew up .
HENDRICKS: Oh .
BRODY: What about that camera ?
HENDRICKS: What camera ?
BRODY: That one from the wreck . You ought it up , did you look inside it ? Hendricks ' guilty look confirms he did n't .
HENDRICKS: If there is , develop it !
BRODY: You got it .
HENDRICKS: I know just where to go .
BRODY: Not the drugstore !
HENDRICKS: Of course not , They 're closed . Phil Fogarty 's place . He 'll do it for me .
BRODY: The drugstore 's closed ? What the hell time is it ?
HENDRICKS: Nine-thirty , ten maybe .
BRODY: Shit I 'm late for dinner Close up , okay ?
HENDRICKS: Right .
ELLEN: Thank you . I 'll tell him .
BRODY: For me ?
ELLEN: Sort of Matthew Hooper is aboard the research vessel Aurora , presently in the Antarctic Ocean , and wo n't be in radio range until half-past next spring .
BRODY: Damn .
MIKE: Is Hooper coming to dinner ?
BRODY: Not till next year .
ELLEN: Oh , perfect a 75 per cent family affair . Where were you ?
BRODY: Santos ' place .
ELLEN: Careful . What 's wrong ?
BRODY: Nothing .
ELLEN: Nothing , huh ?
BRODY: That 's what I said . Is there any of that hand cleaner stuff ?
ELLEN: Use the little brush there . Why were you at Santos ' ?
BRODY: Found one of the missing victims from that boat deal .
ELLEN: Oh . Want to talk about it ?
BRODY: No .
ELLEN: Terrific .

MIKE: Hey , come on
BRODY: No backtalk ! I spoke to Upton , at the beach , and he 's got a job fo you there . You can work until school starts .
ELLEN: All summer ?
BRODY: He wanted a job , he 's got one . I want to see that boat out of the water by tomorrow night .
ELLEN: Not so loud !
BRODY: I know what you 're going to say .
ELLEN: Do you ?
BRODY: In the city , it happened all the time some Kid o.d . 's on a rooftop , top , a drunk gets cut in pieces unde the Brooklyn local , old people die alone in shitty apartments and three weeks later someone calls the cops ecause of the smell and the flies . Call the cops . What are we , immune ?
ELLEN: It was bad , was n't it .
BRODY: The goddamn smell is always the same .
ELLEN: Are you going to be able to sleep ?
BRODY: Yeah . I think so . Mike ! Keep it down , for chrissake !
PETERSON: This is the town beach ; the development naturally has its own private access , but I wanted you to see the concession area . Look at that sand like sugar !
ELLEN: During the summer , the sun sets right there Over the water . Beautiful .
VAUGHN: I 'll say hello for you .

SEAN: I 'm helping .
VAUGHN: You know where your dad is ?

VAUGHN: Len , can I see you a minute ? Peterson excuses himself and joins the Mayor .
PETERSON: I think we got a couple of live ones .
VAUGHN: Brody 's riding his tower .

JACKIE: This is fun ! Can we go faster ?
LARRY: Trim .
JACKIE: Yay !
LARRY: That 's my dad ! Jackie waves without seeing .

VAUGHN: Maybe nobody will notice . Let 's get them back in the bus .
MRS. BRYANT: Renee wants to know what that man is doing way up there ?
PETERSON: He 's , ah , watching . A lookout .
MRS. BRYANT: For what ?
RENEE: It 's a shark tower . I saw one in Florida . He 's looking for sharks .
VAUGHN: It 's an observation platform . That 's our Chief of Police . He 's just checking it .
PETERSON: Normally , it 's used for , ah , bird watching . Nature observation . Weathe measurements , that sort of thing . Ellen , we 're running late !
ELLEN: Okay . Folks , if we could get back on , we 'll show you the country club , and stop for lunch

ELLEN: It 's okay . It 's over
BRODY: It 's all right , everything 's all ight
VAUGHN: Brody 's a good man .
KAISER: Nobody says he is n't .
PETERSON: You should 've been out there . You should 've seen him waving that gun , like a maniac . There were shots fired !
VAUGHN: He thought he had a good reason .
MS. NICHOLS: But that 's not rational behavior !
PETERSON: That 's what I 'm saying !
VAUGHN: How many people were there ?
MS. NICHOLS: Hundred ! Literally hundreds . What are they going to say about us ?
PETERSON: Larry , I 'm a businessman , trying to make a buck like anybody else .
VAUGHN: So ? So ?
PETERSON: So it ca n't be done like that . The man 's a menace , plain and simple .
VAUGHN: Look , what am I supposed to do ? It 's done , it 's over . We have to deal with the consequences .
SANSOM: That 's what we 're here to do .
VAUGHN: All right . Let 's go into my office , where we can have a little privacy .
BRODY: Polly , no calls , please Okay , okay . Hello Phil ? Fogarty ? What pictures I 'll be right down
PHIL: I do n't know what you did , but that kid stopped . I have n't heard one peep , not one 'breaker breaker ' fo days . Believe me , it 's a pleasure
BRODY: You said something about a camera .
PHIL: Sure , sure Jeff Hendricks brought in this camera , see , from underwater , and I did n't know how to get it open , ut my brother-in-law , in Montauk , he works at a hi-fi store , and they sell cameras , so he
BRODY: Did you get any pictures ?
PHIL: Well , yeah , I did , that 's the funny thing . You ca n't tell much from the negatives , I was going to blow 'em up . Here 's a test I did
BRODY: What else you got ?
PHIL: Let 's see you got a minute ?
BRODY: Come on , Phil , do n't jerk me around .
PHIL: Okay , okay stand over there
PETERSON: Speak of the devil .
BRODY: Thank God you guys were all together . I got something for you . Proof !
VAUGHN: Martin , this is kind of an official meeting
BRODY: Perfect . Look at this - He fumbles with the envelope .
VAUGHN: Chief the Board of Selectmen has a question only you can answer .
BRODY: What ?
PETERSON: Is Jeff Hendricks qualified to fill in as an interim Chief of Police in your absence ?
BRODY: Temporarily ? Uh sure The question 's out of left field . Why are they asking ?
NICHOLS: So Jeff could handle things ? He knows the routine , he has the authority ?
BRODY: Yeah . Why ?
PETERSON: It came up during the meeting .
BRODY: Look I just got this from Phil Fogarty . It was in the camera elonging to the missing divers . It proves I was right , all along .
KAISER: Seaweed ?
NICHOLS: It 's underwater , is n't it ? That 's why it 's so dark .
SANSOM: I do n't know what is it ?
BRODY: It 's a shark ! A Great White ! Jesus , it 's right there ! He snatches up the photo .
BRODY: What are you all , blind ? It 's a shark . Look teeth , jaw , gills .
PETERSON: Is that what it is ?
BRODY: You 're damn right that 's what it is .
NICHOLS: I 'm sorry , I just do n't see it .
VAUGHN: Martin , it could be anything .
BRODY: What the hell does it take to make sense to you numbskulls ? Jesus , it 's ight there in front of you . I know what a goddamn shark looks like , I 've been through it , do n't you understand ? I 've seen this sonofabitch efore !
PETERSON: What have you seen before ? This is nothing . Seaweed . Mud . Something in the lens .
BRODY: My ass !
VAUGHN: Be reasonable , please
PETERSON: Forget it , he wo n't listen .
BRODY: There is nothing to discuss .
PETERSON: Will you listen to this man ? Will you just listen to him ? You really caused a panic on a public each , you shoot up the place , God knows who could 've been injured what if somebody decides to sue us ? That could ruin us .
BRODY: Is that what it is ? Dollars ? Money ? I 'll pay for it . Take it out of my salary .
PETERSON: You do n't make enough .
BRODY: Maybe I do n't make as much money as some bullshit rip-off artists around here , but I do n't work the same way .
PETERSON: What 's that supposed to mean ?
BRODY: It means I do n't like all that grab- ass and heavy breathing with my wife , it means I know who 's out to screw me here , and it means that I know something none of you know because I 've been there and I do n't want to go through that horror again . Ever ! There 's a long pause .
VAUGHN: Martin , could you wait here for a few minutes while we make up ou minds about something ?
BRODY: Go ahead , whatever it 's worth .
PETERSON: I wo n't mention his personal attack on me .
NICHOLS: I 've never seen him like this .
PETERSON: And Hendricks is qualified , you heard that from his own mouth .
KAISER: We made a motion and it was already seconded .
VAUGHN: Very well then . It is moved and seconded that Martin Brody be relieved of his duties as Chief of Police , his contract with the township be terminated , and that Jeff Hendricks e appointed Acting Chief in the interim . Those in favor ? All the hands go up .
PETERSON: Anyone opposed , or is it unanimous ?
VAUGHN: I 'm sorry , but I respect his convictions . The motion is carried . He goes to the door , and opens it .
ELLEN: Hi . I closed a sale today , without Len . That 's $ 1200 commission , if the papers go through .
BRODY: That 's great .
ELLEN: Sean 's asleep .
BRODY: That 's great too . Gorgeous . He takes a long look at her .
ELLEN: What 's wrong ?
BRODY: Ooohh , nothing . I just got fired , that 's all . He tosses the photo sloppily on the desk .
ELLEN: What ?
BRODY: What 'd I say ?
ELLEN: That you were fired .
BRODY: Then that 's what I meant . Fired . Canned . Out on my fanny . The Selectmen just made Hendricks the new Chief of Police . Just like that .
ELLEN: Because of today ? The beach ?
BRODY: No sweat . A blessing in disguise . Back to the city , you can go to Bloomingdale 's without waiting six hours for the ferryboat we 're surrounded by water here , you realize that ? Me , surrounded by water Ridiculous .
ELLEN: Stop that ! We 're not going any place . You love it here . Tell me what the hell happened !
BRODY: Showed them the photo , showed them the goddamn Shark , big as life . They did n't see it . Not like me . Not like the poor son-of-a-bitch who snapped this li ' l picture He 's out there , somewhere I shot off my gun , shot off my big mouth , so they fired me
ELLEN: Honey , this is nothing I do n't know what it is . What did they
BRODY: Everybody wants the job . No one wants the authority . Except Hendricks . Fine . He can go out there in that precious boat , and when he looks whitey in his big mouth he can just call me . Call me in New York tell him to kiss my ass
ELLEN: They have no right to treat you like that . You 've given them everything . For four years , you 've protected this town , the people on this island
BRODY: Fired me ! I 'm not a hysterical man . I 'm esponsible . I know what I saw
ELLEN: I know you did
BRODY: I try . Goddamnit , I tried Now , I 'm tired I ca n't keep fighting it I 'm too tired I 'm I 'm

DOUG: I ca n't help it , it sticks in my mind .

JACKIE: Ca n't we stop ? Silence from the group .
BROOKE: They 're probably looking for us .

LARRY: Maybe it 's gone .
DOUG: They tend to follow moving things . Maybe it 's following Polo and Timmy . They consider this .
BROOKE: So all we have to do is land at Cable Junction and wait .
PATRICK: First we got to get there .
LARRY: How 're we going to do that floating on this garbage ?
BOB: Anyone got another set of sails ?
SEAN: Is that big thing still out there ?
MARGE: Shhhh .
LARRY: Hey !
BOB: Over here !
ANDY: Do n't everyone jump around !
PILOT: Air One to Base . I have a positive location on that sailing party . Disabled and adrift about 3/4 miles west of Cable Junction , wind and current carrying them just about due east . I count ten juveniles .
PILOT: Everyone okay ? Any injuries ? The Kids ad-lib in the affirmative .
ANDY: Can you put us on Cable Junction ?
PILOT: I got no room for passengers .
ANDY: How about a tow ? Can you rig that ?
LARRY: As soon as you get us on the island , you got to call in . My dad 's the mayor

BRODY: Did he raise the Kids ?
PATROL VOICE: Last transmission said ten juveniles .
BRODY: Yeah ? Then what ?
PATROL VOICE: Then nothing . If you see him , tell him to switch to an operational frequency , or give me a status report yourself .
BRODY: Did you say Cable Junction ?
PATROL VOICE: That 's what he said .
BRODY: When ?

LUCY: Dear Jesus , Holy Mary , Mother of God , help us , please
BROOKE: Keep her warm . Jackie ? Baby ?
PATRICK: Can someone help me rig a jury rudder ? We might steer this
DOUG: By 7 46 , when the tide turns around , we 'll be twenty miles out . More , with this wind .

MIKE: Sean 's still out there .
BRODY: What ?
MIKE: He wanted to come . It was okay , was n't it ? It was okay before
POLO: The others are ratted together . Drifting .
BRODY: Which way ?
TIMMY: With the current . Towards Cable Junction .
MIKE: Dad , I 'm sorry
BRODY: Stay here . Do n't go anywhere . Just stay here .
ANDY: Bring her to port a little . That 's it steady .
DOUG: I think we 're changing course a little .
BROOKE: Can we land on it ?
LUCY: If we can get to it .
JACKIE: We 're going to die .
BROOKE: It 's all right , we 're okay .
ANDY: More to port .
BOB: It 's all the way over .
ANDY: Shit .
SEAN: Are we going to go on the island ?
BROOKE: You bet , kiddo .
ANDY: I do n't know .
LARRY: What the hell , we 're steering fo it .
DOUG: The wind drift is lateral .
LARRY: What 's that mean ?
DOUG: Sideways For every yard we go this way , we also slide sideways this way His hands illustrate the predicament .
LUCY: But we had it ! We were headed right for it !
ANDY: Shit . Shit , shit , shit !
JACKIE: We 're going to miss it ! The others are silent . It 's true .
ANDY: Do n't !
DOUG: Stop paddling !
LUCY: But the island !
ANDY: The Shark .
BROOKE: What is it ?
ANDY: We 're hung up on something .
DOUG: Maybe the bottom .
JACKIE: It 's that thing . It 's going to kill us now We 're going to die !
LARRY: Shut up ! Just shut Up !
BROOKE: Leave her alone !
BOB: Lighten up , man

RANDAL: What 'd I tell you two about dealing in front of the store ? Drop the kid and peddle your wares someplace else , urn-boy . And for the record , The Time sucked ass .
JAY: Yo-youse guys wan na hear something fucked up about him and the Quick Stop guy ?
RANDAL: Hey , ca n't we do something about those two stoners hanging around outside all the time ?
DANTE: Why ? What 'd they do now ?
RANDAL: I 'm trying to watch Clash of the Titans , and all I can hear is the two them screaming about Morris Day at the top of their lungs .
DANTE: I thought the fat one did n't really talk much .
RANDAL: What , am I producing an A & E Biography about 'em ? I 'm just saying they should n't be loitering around the stores like they do .
DANTE: Neither should you , but we let you stay .
RANDAL: See , manif you were funnier than that , ABC never would 've canceled us .
DANTE: What ?
RANDAL: Nothing . Enter Teen 1 and Teen 2 , chuckling .
TEEN 1: Two packs of Wraps . Yohow was the service ?

TEEN 1: May the Foreskin be with you . Hand Jabba the Hutt .
RANDAL: Yeah , I want to report a couple of drug dealers out in front of the Quick Stop .
JAY: What the Fuck , Serpico ? What 'd we do ?
COP: We got a report that two guys were hanging around outside the stores , selling pot ?
JAY: We do n't smoke pot , yo . Teen 1 enters and hands Jay rolling papers .
TEEN 1: Here 're the rolling papers you wanted for your pot . And your change . Thanks . And The Time sucks ass !

JAY: What ? I got a wiping problem . I stick these little pieces of pape over my brown-eye , and bamno shit stains in my undies . You do n't believe me ? Lem me show you .
COP: Pull up your pants up sir , Now !
JAY: What ? It 's suddenly a crime to fart , motherfucker ? !
BRODIE: Dante and Randal slapped you with a estraining order ? !
JAY: Judge said if we go within a hundred feet of the stores , we get thrown into County .
BRODIE: So you gon na abide by the court 's uling or you gon na go Bandit Reynolds style ?
JAY: Fuck yeah ! You know what they make you do in county ? Toss the fucking salad ! I do n't like this fuck 's asshole ; I 'm gon na do it for some stranger ?
BRODIE: I guess if you really wanted to hang out in from of a convenience store , you could just buy your own now what with all that money you guys made .
JAY: Hell yeah , bitch . Wait a secondwhat money ?
BRODIE: The money from the movie , dumb-ass .
JAY: What the fuck are you babbling about ?
BRODIE: The Bluntman and Chronic movie . Oh my Goddo n't tell me you have no idea there 's a movie being made of the comic you two were the basis for .
JAY: What ? ! Since when ?
BRODIE: Goddamit , man Here 's the pulse , alright . And here 's your finger far from the pulse , jammed straight up your ass . Saywould you like a chocolate covered pretzel ? Brodie leads them back to the counter .
JAY: When the fuck did this happen ? !
BRODIE: Well , after X-Men hit at the box office , all the studios started buying up every comic property they could get their hands on . Miramax optioned Bluntman and Chronic .
JAY: Miramax ? I thought they only made classy flicks like The Piano and The Crying Game ?
BRODIE: Yeah , well once they made She 's All That , everything went to hell . So you 're saying you have n't gotten a cut of the movie ? Did n't Holden McNeil and Banky Edwards used to pay you likeness rights for the comic book ?
JAY: We have n't seen a fucking dime fo no movie !
BRODIE: Well boys , I 'm no lawyer , but I think Holden and Banky owe you some of the proverbial phat cash . I mean they 're making a movie based on characters that are based on you and Quiet Robert .
JAY: It ai n't me and Quiet Robert . It 's a pair of stupid-ass superheroes that un around saying `` Snitchy-Nitchies '' or something .
BRODIE: I believe it `` Snootchie Boochies . '' Regardlessyou 're getting screwed . If I was you guys , I 'd confront Holden McNeil and ask him for my movie check .
JAY: Shit yeah . We gotsa get paid .
BRODIE: And on that note , we cue the music .
HOLDEN: Well ! I have been waiting years to do this . Look at these morose motherfuckers ight here . Smells like someone shit in their cereal . Bunngg !
JAY: What the fuck took you so long answering your damn door ? You trying to talk another girlfriend of yours into some of that gay-ass three-way action with your buddy ?
HOLDEN: No , I was just showering your mother 's stink off me after I gave her a quick jump and sent her home . But now that you mention it Thanks , you know . You could 've made the moral of that story you told me a bit more clear . Silent Bob shrugs .
JAY: Oh , I 'll tell you what our necks are doing in your woods Silent Bob holds up the Wizard article .
HOLDEN: You heard about that too , Hunh ? Well , I 've got nothing to do with it . That 's Banky 's deal . He owns the property now . I signed my half of the Bluntman and Chronic right over to him years ago .
JAY: Why the fuck would you do a thing like that ?
HOLDEN: Because I 'm almost thirty , for God 's sakewhy on earth would I want to keep writing about characters whose central preoccupations are weed and dick and fart jokes ? You got ta grow , man . Do n't you ever want more fo yourself ? I know this poor , hapless sonovabitch does . I look in his doe eyes and I see a man crying out , `` When , Lord ? When the fuck can your servant ditch this foul-mouthed little chucklehead to whom I am a constant victim of his folly , and who bombards me and those around us with grade-A foolishness that prevents me from even getting to kiss a girl ? Fuck ! When ? !
JAY: I 'm the chucklehead ? Fuck youyou 're the dumb-ass who gave away his comic , and now you ai n't got no fat movie check neither .
HOLDEN: When you 're right , you 're right . I wish I 'd broken off a little piece for myself . Because if the buzz is any indication , the movie 's gon na make some huge bank .
JAY: What buzz ?
HOLDEN: The Internet buzz .
JAY: What the fuck is the Internet ?
HOLDEN: The Internet is a communication device that allows people the world over to itch about movies and share pornography with one another . Here 's what we 're looking for `` Movie PoopShoot.com ''
JAY: `` PoopChute . '' Yeaaahhh .
HOLDEN: This is a site full of militant movie uffs sad bastards who live in thei parents ' basements , downloading scripts and trading what they believe to be inside info about movies and actors they despise yet ca n't stop discussing . This is where you go if you wan na hear frustrated would-be filmmakers mouth off with their two- it , arm-chair-director 's opinions on how they all could 've made a bette Episode One .
JAY: Friday ? ! Shit . Does it say who 's playing us in the movie ?
HOLDEN: No , but if it 's Miramax , I 'm sure it 'll be Ben Affleck and Matt Damon . They put'em in a bunch of movies .
JAY: Who ?
HOLDEN: You knowthe guys from Good Will Hunting .
JAY: You mean the fucking movie with Mork from Ork in it ?
HOLDEN: Yeah , I 'm not too big a fan either . Though Affleck was the bomb in Phantoms .
JAY: Word , bitch . Phantoms like a motherfucker .
HOLDEN: Now down here is where you can gauge the buzz . This is the Shoot Back area . It 's where people who read the news get to chime in with their two cents . Here 's what a guy who goes by the chick-magnet Net handle of `` Wampa- One '' thinks about Bluntman and Chronic . `` Bluntman and Chronic and their stupid alter egos Jay and Silent Bob only work in small doses , if at all . They do n't deserve their own movie . '' He 's got a point .
JAY: Fuck him . What 's the next one say ?
HOLDEN: `` Bluntman and Chronic is the worst comic I ever read . Jay and Silent Bob are stupid characters . A couple of stoners who spout dumb-ass catchphrases like a third-rate Cheech and Chong or Bill and Ted . Fuck Jay and Silent Bob . Fuck them up thei stupid asses . ''
JAY: Who the fuck said that shit ? !
HOLDEN: A guy who calls himself `` Magnolia- Fan . '' Check out what the guy afte him said `` Jay and Silent Bob are terrible , one-note jokes that only stoners laugh at . They 're fucking clown shoes . If they were real , I 'd eat the shit out of them for being so stupid . I ca n't believe Miramax would have anything to so with this shit . I , for one , will be boycotting this movie . Who 's with me ? '' And then there are about fifty more posts from people who agree to join Spartacus-here 's boycott of the flick .
JAY: I 'm gon na kill all these fucks
HOLDEN: Ah , let it go . Number one , they 're a unch of jealous little dicks who use the anonymity of the Net to insult people who 're doing what they wish they were doing , and number two , they 're not really talking about you guysthey talking about Bluntman and Chronic .
JAY: But they said Jay and Silent Bob ! They used our real names . It does n't matter that there 's a comic book version of us and a real version , 'cause nobody knows we 're real in eal life .
HOLDEN: Really .
JAY: Yeah ! And all these people who read that shit think the real Jay and Silent Bob are a couple of faggots 'cause of that all these dicks are writing about the comic book Jay and Silent Bob ! And maybe one night , me and Lunchbox 'll be macking some bitch , and she 'll be like `` Oooo ! I want to suck youse guys dicks off . What 's your names ? '' And I 'll be like , `` Jay and Silent Bob . '' And she 'll be like , `` OhI read on the Internet that youse guys were little fucking jerkoffs . '' And then she goes and sucks two other guys 's dicks off instead ! Well fuck that ! We got ta put a stop to these hateful sonsa- itches before they ruin our good names !
HOLDEN: First off , I do n't know how good your names really are . Secondly , there 's not much you can do about stopping this bile . The Internet 's given everyone in America a voice , and everyone in American has chosen to use that voice to bitch about movies . As long as there 's a Bluntman and Chronic movie , the Net-nerds are gon na have something negative to say about it . Jay steams , thinking . Then , a light dawns on him .
JAY: But wait a secondif there was n't a Bluntman and Chronic movie , then no one would be saying shit about Jay and Silent Bob , right ?
HOLDEN: They 're not saying anything about you nowthey 're talking about fictional characters !
JAY: So all we got ta do is stop 'em from making the movie !
HOLDEN: Yeah , and kiss-off the hundreds of thousands of dollars in royalties you 're due in the process . Are you fucking retarded ? Look , I 'm probably not alone in the opinion that this flick is the worst idea since Greedo shooting first . I mean , a Jay and Silent Bob movie ? Who would pay to see that ?
JAY: No , Holden McNeilwhat 's important here is that there 's a bunch of motherfuckers we do n't even know calling us assholes on the Internet to a bunch of teenagers and guys who ca n't even get laid . Putting a stop to that is the most important thing we could ever do . When did it say they 're making that movie ?
HOLDEN: They start this Friday .
JAY: So if today 's Tuesday , that gives us Eight days .
HOLDEN: It 's more like three days .
JAY: Right . Three days to stop that stupid fucking movie from getting made ! C'mon , Silent Bob
HOLDEN: Now that 's what I call the Blunt leading the Blunt .
JAY: Tickets ? Since when did they start charging for the bus ? They head toward the depot .
DRIVER: It 's a threeday ride to Los Angeles , sir . We left twenty minutes ago .
JAY: I did n't ask you about Los Angeles . I asked you about Hollywood .
DRIVER: Hollywood 's in Los Angeles , sir .
JAY: Do n't change the subject ! Are we in Hollywood yet or not ?
DRIVER: Please sit down , sir .
JAY: Why do n't you take your seat Ralph Kramden Jay slumps into the seat beside Silent Bob .
CHILD: Leave me alone , little kid .
JAY: That fuck called me a little kid and gave me the finger ! Go kick his ass !
PASSENGER: They been in there going on half an hour now ! Two of them ! Doing God knows what !
DRIVER: This bus is n't moving another inch unless you clear out of there right now !
JAY: UmI think something 's burning back here .
VOICE: 'Cause you 're doing it all wrong .
GUY: You got ta induce the drivers a little .
JAY: Like how ?
GUY: Like this .

JAY: Well , I do n't wan na cough up some dude 's sperm !
GUY: Do n't be so suburbanthis is the new millennium . Gay , straightit 's all the same now . There 're no more lines . Jay draws a line on the ground with his foot .
JAY: There 's one . On this side of it , we ai n't gay .

JAY: Shityou nuns are alright .
NUN: You live by the Book , too ?
JAY: You picked us up , did n't you ? I got ta .
NUN: That 's good to hear . But it takes deed , not words . It 's a lot easie to say you live by the Book than to actually do it . Can you do it ?

NUN: No time like the present , right ?
JAY: Alright . You hear that ? She 's not a Catholic . She 's a Presbyterian .
GUY: And now we can finally solve the mystery of the Hitchhiking Ghouls ! Pull off their masks and let 's see who they really are !

JAY: What the fuck are you bitches babbling about ?
BRENT: Hey ! Watch the language little boy . There are females present .
JUSTICE: Provasik Pharmaceuticals is a medical lab where they perform gross experiments on animals .

BRENT: Nomore like rabbits , dogs , cats heck , even monkeys , If we do n't speak for them , who will ? Right , Jussy ?
JAY: Hey , uhBrent ? Can I talk to you over here for a second ?

JAY: Ch'yeah , right . Jersey represent !
JUSTICE: Oh , a Jersey Boy . What brings you all the way out here ?
JAY: Well , we could n't hang in front of the Quick Stop no more , 'cause of the strainen-en order , which sucks ass 'cause it 's been like our home since we were kids . Silent Bob even usted his cherry there .
JUSTICE: You did ? I 'll bet she was a lucky girl .
JAY: Look , fuck that fat fuckI 'm trying to tell a story here .
JUSTICE: Sorry .
JAY: Anyway , we were talking to Brodie and he said there 's gon na be a Bluntman and Chronic movie . So we went to see Holden McNeil , and he showed us the Internet , and that 's where we found all these fucking little jerkoffs were saying shit about us . So we decided to go to Hollywood and stop the movie from getting made . And now we 're here .
JUSTICE: Wow . I have no idea what you just said .
JAY: Yeah , I get that a lot . So you like animals , huh ?
JUSTICE: Sure .
JAY: That 's cool . Even snakes ?

JAY: Do n't ask . So , uhwhat can a pimp-daddy like me do to help the animals ?
JUSTICE: You really do n't want to help us
JAY: What the fuck are you talking about ? Sure I do . I 'd do anything for you . Justice smiles . Jay tries to recover .

MISSY: Smooth move , Justice .
CHRISSY: Nice going , Four Eyes !
JUSTICE: Ow !
SISSY: Why the fuck did you let that little stoner throw Brent our of the van ? !
JUSTICE: Oh pleaseif I had to listen to one more of those stupid songs , I was going to throw him out myself .
SISSY: We needed Brent , Justice ! He was ou patsy !
JUSTICE: We 'll find someone else . Besides , I did n't see you trying to stop Jay from throwing him out .
SISSY: Because I did n't want to blow ou cover !
JUSTICE: Cover , shmoveryou all hated his songs , too .
CHRISSY: Not as much as I hate you . Justice offers Chrissy a cold glance ,
SISSY: Do n't mind Chrissy . She 's just a little too wound for sound .
CHRISSY: Then how about you help me take the edge off ?
JUSTICE: They 're really good friends .
JUSTICE: They already doshe 's the milkmaid , and she 's the cow .
CHRISSY: Oh , I 'm a cow , am I ? I 'm a mad cow , itch . And now I 'm gon na rip you head off and fuck your spine stump .
SISSY: Enough ! We have a very simple gang here , Justice . I 'm the brains , Chrissy 's the brawn , and Missy 's the tech-girl . But lately , I 'm having a hard time figuring out what you 're doing here .
JUSTICE: That makes two of us .
CHRISSY: Shityour name does n't even fit the hyme scheme .
JUSTICE: That 's because very few names rhyme with `` douchebag . ''
CHRISSY: You 're dancing on my last nerve , Strawberry Shortcake . You deal with the weak link . I 'm gon na take Missy into the dirty convenience store bathroom and hate- fuck the shit out of her .
JUSTICE: And you said letting them read all that Anais Nin would n't amount to anything .
SISSY: Do n't change the subject . You know what you have to do now , right ? Since you let our patsy slip away , you 've got ta convince the little kid and that fat guy to take his place . They 've got ta break into Provasik now .
JUSTICE: Uh-uh !
SISSY: Uh-huh . You 'll do it ; or you 're out of this gang . Just use the little one 's crush to convince him , since he 's so fucking in love with you .
JUSTICE: Jay ? No he 's not .
SISSY: Whatam I blind ? He was n't kissing your hand back in the van like he was fucking Lord Byron ?
JUSTICE: Well , maybe he was just raised with manners .
SISSY: You 're the one that brought the kid in , Jussy . So you 've got ta make amends .
JUSTICE: Jay is not taking Brent 's place as the patsy .
SISSY: That kid and his quite friend are our only options at this point . Now we got about two hours before we get to Boulder . That gives you plenty of of time to work on him .
JUSTICE: I 'm not gon na do it .
SISSY: Why the fuck not ?
JUSTICE: Because he 's just to so innocent !
JAY: I 'm gon na finger-fuck her tight little asshole ! Finger-bang and tea-bang my allsin her mouth ! Where ? Where ? In her mouthballs-a-plenty in he mouth ! Balls , balls , sweaty balls
SISSY: Who 's it going to be , Jussyhim o us ?
JAY: Steal a monkey ? Shitno problem .
JUSTICE: It 's not really stealingit 's liberating it , and Wait a seconddid you say , `` No problem '' ?
JAY: Yeah , Fuckwe steal monkeys all the time . Right , Lunchbox ? Silent Bob glares at Jay .
JUSTICE: It 's not like it 's a bad thing . It 's for a good cause .
JAY: Oh , it for the best cause , mon cheri The cause of love . Snoogans
JUSTICE: What the heck is that ?
JAY: What 's what ?
JUSTICE: `` Snoogans , '' I believe it was .
JAY: What the fuck do you think it means ? It means `` I 'm kidding . ''
JUSTICE: Ohhh . Well , that 's too bad .
JAY: I ca n't believe I 'm gon na get some pussy for stealing a monkey ! If I 'd known it was that easy , I'd 've een stealing monkeys since I was like seven and shit .
JUSTICE: They 're gon na do it .
SISSY: Good . They do their part And we 'll do ours . Justice eyes Sissy , then slumps in her seat .
JUSTICE: Rememberwe meet back here when you 're done . You sure you 're okay with this ?
JAY: As sure as I am that you 're the hottest bitch I ever seen .
JUSTICE: Maybe it 's because women do n't like to be called `` bitches , '' Jay .
JAY: They do n't ? Well how 'bout `` piece of ass '' ?
JUSTICE: How about not .
JAY: Well , what the fuck am I supposed to call you , then ?
JUSTICE: Something sweet , you big goof . Something nice .
JAY: Boo-boo kitty fuck .
JUSTICE: Okay . That 's a start .
SISSY: Jay , before you go , could you say something into the camera about the clitoris .
JAY: What ?
JUSTICE: Man you are such a bitch
SISSY: She 's just a little embarrassed . See , Jussy and I are putting togethe this documentary for our Human Sexuality class , and we need a male perspective on the clitoris .
JAY: The female clitoris ?
SISSY: Uhyeah .
JUSTICE: Jay , you do n't have to do this . She elbows Sissy .
JAY: Nah , it 's cool , hon . There 's a few things I can say about the clit that I 's like you to hear . I am the master of the clit ! I make that shit work ! It does what eve the fuck I tell it to do ! No one ules the clit like me ! Not this little fuck ! None of you little fucks out there ! I am the clit commander ! ! ! Remember that commander of all clits !
SISSY: Awesome . Knock 'em dead , Tiger . Sissy climbs back into the van .
JAY: Socan I get a little kiss for good luck ?
SISSY: Jussy . C'mon . Justice climbs back into the van .
JUSTICE: Yes , sir .
SISSY: Phase One , down . While we 're executing Phase Two , you edit that tape and grab a new car .
MISSY: No sweat .
SISSY: Let 's suit up .
JAY: You fat fuck
SISSY: They in ?
MISSY: You can say that .
SISSY: Time to shine . Let 's go .
JUSTICE: You are so gay .
SISSY: Once we 're inside , I want complete silence . Missy whipped this up . It counts ou decibel level . If it goes into the edalarm , we 're dead . So not even the slightest noise , got it ?
JAY: Stay frosty , you big fucking softie . We 've got a job to do .
CHRISSY: Holy fuckthe little stoner was ight
SISSY: I ca n't believe it . Months of planning and it 's all blown by a fucking fart .
JUSTICE: We ca n't just leave them like this ! That alarm 's gon na bring the cops here any minute !
SISSY: That was always the plan , Justice ! They take the heat off of is long enough until we can get out of town !
CHRISSY: Kaboom , you little stoner fucks .
JAY: What the fuck are you looking at ? There ai n't no snacks here , man ! Now we got what we came for , so let 's get the fuck out !
JAY: Oh shit
JAY: Justice We crane up from him as he bellows
DEPUTY: Oh , fudge Marshal Willenholly !
WILLENHOLLY: Yeah , you chug that ass-cock baby It takes two hands to hold does n't it ? Uhhh
DEPUTY: Yes , sir .
WILLENHOLLY: Boulder , hunh ? Well , gas up the jet .
DEPUTY: We do n't have a jet , sir . And Boulder 's only ten minutes away .
WILLENHOLLY: Then gas up the next best thing .
COP 1: Oh really ? And why is that ?
WILLENHOLLY: Because someone let a whole mess of animals out of their cages , sir .
COP 1: Well , we believe that was just a diversionary tactic used to call attention away from the real heist over here at the Diamond Exchange .
WILLENHOLLY: Yeah , right . That 's a believable scenario . It sounds more like something out of a bad movie .
COP 2: Sir , the Provasik people say they 've ounded all their animals up , except for one an orangutan .
WILLENHOLLY: Listen up , ladies and gentlemen ! Ou fugitive has been on the run for 6 hours ! Average simian foot speed over uneven groundbarring injuries or preoccupation with tire tubes , mites or bananasis four miles an hour . That gives us a radius of twenty miles .
COP 3: Twenty-four , sir !
WILLENHOLLY: What ?
COP 3: Six hours times four miles an hou is twenty-four .
WILLENHOLLY: Yes . Yes , you 're right . My bad . Twenty- four miles . Now what I want out of all of you is a hard target search .
COP 4: Excuse me , sir ?
WILLENHOLLY: Yeah ?
COP 4: What does that mean , exactlya `` hard target search '' ? What 's a `` hard target '' ?
WILLENHOLLY: Well . It'sa targetthat'shard . Anyway
COP 4: So are you referring to the search 's level of difficulty ? Or is the hard target the monkey ?
COP 3: Or the people who stole the monkey ?
WILLENHOLLY: Okay , how about this ? What I want out of all of you is a thorough search of every gas station , residence , warehouse , farmhouse , henhouse , outhouse , and doghouse in that area ! Checkpoints go up at fifteen miles !
COP 1: Would n't it make sense to put them up at every twenty-four milesseeing as that 's how far they 'd have gotten in the last six hours ?
WILLENHOLLY: This is so frustrating . It 's just so hard sometimes
COP 5: Sir , this was just delivered to the station .
WILLENHOLLY: What is it ?
COP 5: It 's a tape from the terrorists who 're claiming credit for the break-in .
WILLENHOLLY: Is it VHS or Beta ? You know what never mind . Do you have a VCR ?
COP: Sir , we do n't have a jet ; just a helicopter .
WILLENHOLLY: Does n't anybody have a jet anymore ? Plafsky ? It is Willenholly . You got ta get me on the national news , pronto . Why ? ! Because we may very well be dealing with the two most dangerous men on the planet !
JAY: This is Jussy 's monkey
ANCHORMAN: I 'm Reg Hartner and this is a News Now bulletin . A Provasik animal testing facility in boulder was the focus of an attack by a terroristic primate rescue syndicate calling themselves the Coalition fo Liberation of Itinerant Tree-Dwellers . Or simply , C.L.I.T .
DIGITIZED VOICE: We are the C.L.I.T . None of you are safe . Now tremble before the might of our merciless leader .
ANCHORMAN: Terrifying . Here to help us understand this footage is Federal Wildlife Marshal Willenholly .
WILLENHOLLY: From the intelligence we 've been able to gather , we 've discovered that the C.L.I.T . is a tiny offshoot of the L.A.B.I.A .
ANCHORMAN: The Liberate Apes Before Imprisoning Apes movement .
WILLENHOLLY: Exactly . The men you saw in the video are believed to be the masterminds esponsible for the frenzied C.L.I.T . activity last night . They go by the obvious code names `` Jay '' and `` Silent Bob . '' If you should come across them o any other C.L.I.T.-ies , please exercise extreme caution .
HOLDEN: Nights like this , I miss dating a lesbian .
RANDAL: I told you that restraining orde was a good idea .
ANCHORMAN: Is that your cell phone ?
WILLENHOLLY: Yes , Excuse me . Federal Wildlife Marshal . I 'm on my way ! We got 'em . They 're in Utah . Citizens of Utahsteer clear of the C.L.I.T . Stimulation of the C.L.I.T . is not recommended .
JUSTICE: Your tape worked . The news is all about Jay and Silent Bob 's Provasik eak-in , with almost no mention of the Diamond heist .
SISSY: I told you those two were the perfect patsies . Now we lay low for awhile just in caseand start planning the next job .
JUSTICE: Do n't you feel any regret ? Jay and Bob do n't deserve this . They were eally sweet .
CHRISSY: The only thing I regret is not gutting that little trout-mouthed prick like a fish and playing Twister with his vitals .
MISSY: You are so nasty .
CHRISSY: I 'll show you nasty , you little slut .
SISSY: Would you two get a room ?
CHRISSY: Finewe 'll take yours . I am gon na stain your sheets , bi- otch .
SISSY: Sarah Lawrence girls . Go figure .
JUSTICE: They 're your gang .
SISSY: Oh and not yours ? You know , I do n't get you , Justice . You used to be all about the girl stuff stealing , oning , blowing shit up . Now you 're like this little priss with a conscience . It 's really a fucking drag .
JUSTICE: We all got ta grow up some time .
SISSY: If moping around over some little oy you 're crushing on is being grown- up , then pass me my Wonder Woman underoos .
JUSTICE: Do n't you feel the least bit of guilt for what we did to those guys ?
SISSY: Awww . Does Jussy-wussy feel all dirty about setting up her boyfriend ? Then how about taking a shower ?
JUSTICE: I 'm sorry , Jay .
JAY: You know , Justice died trying to save this monkey , so maybe we should keep her around . That way , we can honor her memory .
WILLENHOLLY: What ?
SHERIFF: An orangutan 's a member of the great ape family . It 's not a monkey .
WILLENHOLLY: Look , who 's the Federal Wildlife Marshal here ?
JAY: What the fuck are you waiting for ? Go out there and give 'em the monkey . Silent Bob looks to Jay , shocked .
JAY: Do n't shoot ! We 're just trying to take our son out of this hostile environment !
SHERIFF: Their `` son '' ?
WILLENHOLLY: Maybe they 're one of those gay couples ?
JAY: Yeah ! We 're gay ! And this is ou adopted love child ! We 're not from around here ! Do n't make us go back to our liberal city home with a tales of prejudice and bigotry in the heart of Utah ! You see the shit I got ta put up with for you ! Now I got this guy thinking I 'm gay !
WILLENHOLLY: Oh God , this is the last thing I needa bunch of uppity homosexuals shooting their mouth off in the liberal press that the Federal Wildlife Marshal 's Office persecutes gays .
WILLENHOLLY: You see this badge ? I think I 'd ecognize an ape if I saw one . And the only thing I do recognize here is a political fiasco I 'm , going to avoid by letting this butt-fucking Brady Bunch go !
JAY: And I 'll tell you another thing what if that guy shows up around the stores one day and starts telling everybody you and me are poo-gilists ? How are we gon na get any pussy then , hunh ?
JAY: So we can just go ?
WILLENHOLLY: Yes , siror ma'am . Please accept my apologies for detaining you and you unorthodox-but-constitutionally- protected-family unit .
SHERIFF: Un-fucking believable .
JAY: I 'd like to offer a big gay thank- you , sir . We 'll tell all our gay friends that Utah is Gay friendly country for gays who are gay .
WILLENHOLLY: I 'm sure Utah appreciates that . You might also want to make it clea that the Federal Wildlife Marshal 's Office is also pro-'mo as well . And might I add , that 's one fine- looking boy you 're raising .
JAY: Well , that 's 'cuz he 's from my sperm . See , I knocked up a hot woman friend of ours who I also fuck on the side . So as not to be all-the-way-gay . But my tubby husband here is one hundred percent queer . He loves the cock .
WILLENHOLLY: He certainly looks insatiable .
JAY: 'Bye
WILLENHOLLY: 'Bye
JAY: I said you `` love the cock '' ! I got ta e the craftiest motherfucker alive !
WILLENHOLLY: Fire a warning shot into that bulbous ass !
SHERIFF: One rectal breach , coming up !
SHERIFF: Open up and say `` ahhhhh , '' you stone sumbitch
SILENT BOB: AAAAAHHHHHHHHH ! ! !
JAY: INCOMING ! ! !
SUZANNE: OOOOOOOOO ! ! !
JAY: Just like Winnie-the-Pooh .
WILLENHOLLY: Wow ! That was an incredibly daring escape ! You must see that a lot , hunh ?
SHERIFF: Shut up !
WILLENHOLLY: Sire , you 're very taciturn .
SHERIFF: What 're you doing ? They 're trapped . The only way they can get out of there is right here .
WILLENHOLLY: A Federal Wildlife Marshal does n't wait for his prey to come to him . He comes to it . Or goes to it . Is it `` comes to it '' or `` goes to it '' ? I 'm going in there . I 'm counting on you Sheriff . Willenholly embraces the Sheriff .
SHERIFF: Fuck this asshole . Let 's go back to the station and get some donuts .
JAY: This reminds me of the night I fucked your mom , yo . One big-wet , smelly , gaping hole , and me wishing I had a oard tied to my ass
WILLENHOLLY: I DO N'T CARE !
WILLENHOLLY: ON YOUR KNEES !
JAY: See , man ? ! He 's lining us up like fucking circus seals ! Well , I 'm going firstI do n't want no mouthful of monkey-spit when I got ta blow this fucking G-Man .
WILLENHOLLY: Oh , nothink you can pull a Pete Pan on me ? !
JAY: Say it , do n't spray it , bitch .
SHERIFF: Well , if it is n't the wildlife experts . Did you come to it or go to it ?
WILLENHOLLY: Do you have a microwave here , Sheriff ?
SHERIFF: We have a toaster oven . Why ?
WILLENHOLLY: Because I need to dry my gun out so I can SHOOT YOU WITH IT ! TWICE !
SHERIFF: This might cheer you up . Your office just faxed this over . Guy there say it 's a post from an Internet chat board , signed by a `` Jay and Silent Bob . '' Your man thinks it 's a lead as to where those fellas are taking the ape .
WILLENHOLLY: `` All you motherfuckers are gon na pay . You are the ones who are ball- lickers . We 're gon na fuck you mothers while you watch and cry like little bitches . Once we get to Hollywood '' They 're going to Hollywood .
JAY: What ? It 's not like it 's cheating . Justice blew up . Two HOOKERS approach them .
HOOKER 1: Hey , little man . You want some of this ?
HOOKER 2: How about you , Big Boy ?
HOOKER 1: If you 've got fifty bucks we can get nasty .
JAY: Oh yeah ? How nasty ?
HOOKER 2: As nasty as you wan na be , poppie .
JAY: Alrightfirst , I 'll want to tongue your bung while you juggle my balls in one hand and play with my asshole with the other . But do n't stick you finger in . Then . I 'll wan na pinky you and put it in your friend 's brown , while Silent Bob spanks into a Dixie cup . After that , I 'll wan na smell your titties , for a while , and you can pull my nutsack up over my dick , so it looks like a Bullfrog . Then I want you to flick at my nuts while your friend spanks me into the same Dixie cup Silent Bob jizzed in . Then we throw the Dixie cup out . The Hookers look at him , dumbfounded , Then
HOOKER 1: Oh , that 's it honey . I quit . This job just passed the point of no eturn .
HOOKER 2: You one fucked up puppy , poppie .
JAY: What ? ! You said 'nasty ' ? Man , chicks in Hollywood are so stuck up .
DEALER: Crack ? You want some crack ? Sweet- ass rock . Get you high .
JAY: No man , but you want some weed ?
DEALER: You on the job ?
JAY: Yeah , boy . Jersey Local 408 .
DEALER: I 'm Los Angeles Local 305 !
JAY: Shit , no , we might have to strike in September .
DEALER: Norma Rae like a motherfucker . You gots to get your benefits , you know what I 'm saying ?
JAY: I hear that . Yomaybe you can help us out . You know where they 're shooting a movie around here .
DEALER: You in this town and you gon na ask that question ? Be a little more specific .

STEVE: But no sign of Jay and Silent Bob ?
JULES: None whatsoever . However , to be fair , all the feds have to work with is murky videotape , so no one 's even a hundred percent sure what Jay and Silent Bob look like , exactly . Fo all we know , they could already be on the lot .

WILLENHOLLY: The C.L.I.T . stops here , Jay and Silent Bob ! Everyone stay calm . I 'm a Federal Wildlife Marshal . These men are the leaders of a terrorist organization wanted for the abduction of a monkey .
JUSTICE: It was just a diversion so we could steal these .
WILLENHOLLY: Nothe clit 's real . The female orgasm is a myth .
JUSTICE: Are you guys alright ?
JAY: I thought you blew up , Boo Boo Kitty Fuck .
JUSTICE: You remembered . It was a frame-up , Jay . Sissy . Missy , Chrissy , and I are international jewel thieves . We were setting you up as a patsy , but I could n't go through with it , because I because I love you .

SISSY: Are you kidding me ? I taught you all all your moves myself . There 's not a style you can bust that I ca n't defend against .

BANKY: Holy shit ! What the fuck are you guys doing here ? !
JAY: All these assholes are calling us names on the Internet , 'cause of this stupid movie !
BANKY: I feel for you boysI really do . Those Net snipers can be really cruel . But Miramax paid me a shitload of money for Bluntman and Chronic , so it occurs to me that people bad- mouthing you on some web-site is none of my FUCKING CONCERN !
SILENT BOB: Ohbut I think it is .
JAY: Here we go again
SILENT BOB: Shut the fuck up . We had a deal with you on the comics for likeness rights . And as we 're not only the artistic basis but also the character basis for you intellectual property , Bluntman and Chronic , when we said property was optioned by Miramax Films you were legally obliged to secure ou permission to transfer the concept to another medium . As you failed to do that , you 're in breach of the original contractergo , you find yourself in a very actionable position .
JAY: Yeah .
BANKY: So , what do you guys want , to go away and take your lady friends with you ?
JAY: Shitcan this movie so we do n't get called names on the Internet anymore .
BANKY: Even if there 's no movie , people are still free to talk shit about you on the Internet . That 's what the Internet 's for slandering others anonymously . Stopping the flick is n't going to stop that !
JAY: Well this is n't fair ! We went to Hollywood , I fell in love , we stole a monkey , we got shot at , and got punched in the motherfucking nuts ! We ai n't leaving empty-handed !
BANKY: Is n't that your girlfriend 's enemy ?
JAY: Oh yeah . Get the fuck offa me , pig !
BANKY: You guys are gon na ruin my movie career .
JAY: Well , we want something for our mental anguish .
BANKY: Tell you what we 'll settle this monetarily . I 'll give you half of what I made .
JAY: Half ? ! ?
BANKY: Half 's not good enough ? FineI 'll give you two-thirds of what I made !
JAY: Fuck-youyou already said half ? You ca n't take it back !
BANKY: Done
SISSY: Your shit is so tired , Justice !
JUSTICE: Call me Boo-Boo Kitty FuckBITCH !
WILLENHOLLY: Hello ? Truce ? I think I killed both of them .
JUSTICE: C'mon guys . It 's over .
JAY: Yo , I was just about to jump in there and get your back .
JUSTICE: No . I 'm tired of running .
WILLENHOLLY: Oh my God , I 'm paralyzed . The monkey shot me in the ass and paralyzed me ! Oh the irony !
JUSTICE: You 're not paralyzed . It was just a tranquilizer .
WILLENHOLLY: Jesus ! Tranqued by a little monkey ! My friends in the Bureau are neve gon na let me live this down !
JUSTICE: You have friends in the F.B.I . ?
WILLENHOLLY: They all made it in , but I failed the exam . Why the hell else do you think I became a Federal Wildlife Marshal ? 'Cause I 'm a joke !
JUSTICE: Maybe not . I can make you a deal that 'll get you into the F.B.I. , egardless of test scores .
WILLENHOLLY: What kind of deal ?
JUSTICE: You drop the charges against Jay and Silent Bob and say you never found the ape . Make sure the world knows they 're not in control of any C.L.I.T .
JAY: Now wait a second
JUSTICE: I 'll explain later , Jay In exchange , I 'll give you the diamonds I stole , and turn in Sissy , Missy , Chrissy , and myself . But I want a reduced sentence .
WILLENHOLLY: You 'd be willing to do that ?
JUSTICE: For him ? I 'd be willing to do anything . Justice stands and takes Jay by the hands .
JAY: That 's alright . I 'm a junkie with a monkey .
JUSTICE: If I go to prison , will you wait fo me ?
JAY: I do n't know . Will we fuck when you get out ?
JUSTICE: Snoogans . Justice and Jay kiss again .
WILLENHOLLY: Wow . There 's a lot of love in the oom .
BANKY: Regardless of what you may have heard . I do not kiss guys .
WILLENHOLLY: Sorry , Justice . We 've got ta go . Heystop stealing monkeys .
JAY: Fuck you .
WILLENHOLLY: Fair enough .
JUSTICE: Wait for me .
JAY: Whathere ?
BANKY: Well , boysyou 're rich in love Well , you 're in love . And to top that off , you 've got your own monkey . What more could two guys from Jersey possibly want ?
JAY: All those fucks to stop talking shit about us on the Internet , fo starters .
BANKY: What do I keep telling you ? There 's not much you can do to stop that . Well , short of showing up at all their houses and beating the shit out of them , I guess .
JAY: You knowwith all that money we 're gon na make we can buy a lotta plane tickets .
MOTHER: Can I help you ?
JAY: Yes . Ma'am , Does William Dusky live here ?
MOTHER: Yes . He 's my son .
JAY: May we talk to him , please .
MOTHER: One moment .
KID: Yeah ?

KID: Yeah .
JAY: Really
RANDAL: Now that was worse then Clash of the Titans .
DANTE: I still ca n't believe Judy Dench played me .
RANDAL: Heyremind me to renew that estraining order .
DANTE: Why ?
RANDAL: Because I 'm gon na blast the flick on the Internet tonight . STEVE-DAVE and WALT exit .
WALT: Tell'em Steve-Dave !
TRISH: Well , that was just another paean to male adolescence and its refusal to grow up .
ALYSSA: Yeah , sisbut it was better than Mallrats . At least Holden had the good sense to keep his name off of it .
TRISH: Why would n't Miramax option his othe comic instead ? You knowthe one he drew about you and him and you elationship ?
ALYSSA: You mean Chasing Amy ? That would never work as a movie . BANKY and HOOPER exit .
BANKY: I 'm so fucking embarrassed
HOOPER: Honey , you should be . They took you characters and reduced them to one ninety-minute-long-gay joke . It was like watching Batman and Robin again .
BANKY: Thanks . That means a lot coming from the guy who pretends to be Shaft as opposed to the guy who takes shaft .
HOOPER: I do n't hear you complaining nightly . In fact , the only thing I do hea you say is `` Yes , Hooper ! Cradle the alls and work the shaft ! ''
BANKY: Hey ! Hey ! What 'd we say ? Not in public ! A guy behind them calls out to Banks .
GUY: Nice movie , you fucking Tracer !
BANKY: You !
GUY: That 's right , you sonovabitch ! I 'm ack for round two !
WILLENHOLLY: You know , I do n't get out to the movies much . But I 'd have to say Bluntman and Chronic was Blunt-tastic !
JUSTICE: Are these leg cuffs really necessary ?
WILLENHOLLY: Do n't make me shoot you , Justice . And finally , Jay and Silent Bob come out .
THE END: < /pre
BENNY: .. after my third recovery my wife made me swear I 'd never bring another bottle into the house . And I never did . I bur- ied it under the lawn . Cut out a turf & stood it upright with a piece of tin- foil instead of a cork . So here we are out in the yard , and she 's happy because I 'm getting healthy in a pair of swim- ing shorts & no way near no booze . She decides to prune the roses . Meanwhile , I 'm laying there with a straw stuck in- to the fucken lawn doing a quart of red ..
CHAIR: Thank you , Benny .. We have a few more minutes .. Anyone else like to share ? ..
BERLIN: My name 's John .. and I 'm an alcoholic ..
ALL: Hi , John .
BERLIN: I did n't intend to speak today . Matter of fact , I was n't gon na come to the meeting .. But I wan na say a couple of things I hope may be of use , particularly as Benny says , to the new faces here . I first came into this fellowship ten months ago . I came to a meeting I was convinced was gon na be my last - how could a buncha drunks help me ? - Then someone got up , I think it was Micky , and described himself as `` the shit around which the universe revolved . '' I do n't know if that was original to him - it does n't matter , it was the first time I 'd heard it , and I still ca n't think of a better way to describe how I felt - We all have our own place in the darkness , and I was in such a mess I could hardly fucken see - I 'd lost someone very dear to me - she had n't died - I had - I do n't know whether she left coza the drinking , or whether I drank coz I knew she was gon na leave - either way , the booze won - I replaced her with alcohol & anger - I was angry with her , myself , everyone and everything - Where I was I wanted to be someplace else - any place but here - any moment but now - But here I am , and it is now , and there 's a big change about to hap- pen in my life - and I 'm going for it coz this time I know I 'm not running away - I 'm actually two miles into a 600 mile journey , and I feel good about myself going there - So I stopped off to share that with you - and to thank everyone of you , and everyone in this fellowship for letting me walk out of here , free ..

BERLIN: It 's good to be with you , Ross .
ROSS: Glad you finally made it , Bro

BERLIN: Freddy ? Forever - he was my serg- eant when I was a kid - do n't get to see a lot of each other - but we been buddies two hundred years ..
BLATTIS: Did he get you the job ?
BERLIN: I think he would have if he could have - been trying to get me up here long enough - I think he may have bribed the old guy to retire ..
BLATTIS: Popeye was n't old . Younger than you .
CITRINE: Sergeants Serato , and Taylor .
BERLIN: Do me a favor , Travis ? Bring in the resta the stuff from my car ?
BLATTIS: Did you find the knife , Sergeant ?

BERLIN: Maybe he 's lying to you ?
BLATTIS: Is it true you found a hand ?
CITRINE: .. we got a body part . We do n't know what it is - probably some kind of hospital debris - we 're gon na try and check it out . O.K . Now you know as much as we do ..
BLATTIS: Grateful for your candor , Sir .
CITRINE: Then do me a favor , and keep this outta the newspaper - that dump serves a dozen different communities , we do n't even know if it 's ours ? Till we do I do n't want no one worrying about ..
BLATTIS: Was n't frozen , was it , Sergeant ?
CITRINE: Come on , Michael , outta here , the guys trying to move in . I told you what we know , something else , you- 'll be the first to hear about it ..
BERLIN: Why did he ask if it was frozen ?
CITRINE: That , I could n't tell you .. And do n't worry about anya this crap , y the time you 're back it 's gone ..
PATHOLOGIST: .. if the knife had n't killed him , the booze would .. I nev- er seen such a bad cirrhosis ..
BERLIN: You say the cut 's left to right ? Is n't that unusual ? He 's left handed ?
PATHOLOGIST: I guess he was so drunk , he did- n't know which hand he was using . What are you gon na do with it ?
BERLIN: Depends how healthy it is . If it 's any good , I 'll try and get a print ..
ROSS: Frozen ? .. I 've no idea ..
PATHOLOGIST: No , Freddy .. Not a few ..
ROSS: You do a rush on three pizzas ?
MARGIE: I 'm not giving him Pizza . I have n't seem him for a year ? I 'm gon na cook him a dinner .
ROSS: Dinner 's another night , darlin .. This is a drive-by . I got an hour ..
MARGIE: Bobby 's out .. What 's the hurry ?
ROSS: Friday night at City Hall . Got a great chance to frighten the fat .
MARGIE: Freddy 's new obsession ..
BERLIN: Who is who ?
ROSS: A professional , whining , con-person itch with an ass the size of Africa ..
MARGIE: So tonight she confesses ?
ROSS: Tonight I 'm feeling lucky ..
BERLIN: Not for me ..
ROSS: What d'you mean , I just opened it for you ? This is French champagne .
MARGIE: No it is n't .. It 's Californian ..
ROSS: Even better .
BERLIN: Not today .. I 'm on a diet to- day .. I 'll take a diet soda ..
ROSS: Since when did you drink diet soda ?
MARGIE: Stop nagging him . If he does n't want it , he does n't want it . You- 're quacking like an old duck ..
ROSS: How 's the new residence ?
BERLIN: O.K .
ROSS: What does that mean ?
BERLIN: Not too good in daylight ..
ROSS: C'mon , just shut your eyes until it 's painted . You 're gon na love it . This is `` God 's Country , '' John .
BERLIN: Would you drop these off for me ?
VENABLES: Frozen ?
BERLIN: Yeah . What does that mean to you ?
VENABLES: Well , Sir ..
BERLIN: Well , what ?
VENABLES: Well , we had a very bad murde here , coupla years ago . Not act- ually in our county , but south of here . Girl with no head , no hands . You did n't read about it ? It was big shit . They had forty , fifty detective working it . Nev- er identified her . Never found the head , never found the hands ..
BERLIN: Where do I find the file on that ?
VENABLES: In there if we got anything ? I elieve the code was `` Jennifer . ''
BERLIN: No . Been dead two weeks .
ROSS: Seven thirty-five .. Here , `` Town Gets Top Cop . '' I was gon na pin it to your wall .
BERLIN: Why so coy about the word `` frozen '' ?
ROSS: Because , do n't get into it
BERLIN: There 's nothing in the files ?
ROSS: Watch my lips .. Do n't get into it ..
BERLIN: Look - 1 - 2 - 3/4 - 5 - 6 - 7 ..
ROSS: It 's an `` unsolved . '' They spent 500 thousand dollars & bought emselves a dead end - You might wan na check it with Taylor , he worked the case .
BERLIN: I already did . What 's his problem ?
ROSS: He thinks you stole his promotion . What exactly you doin there , John ?
BERLIN: It 's a method for quitting smoking .
ROSS: That 's an interesting method ? Must help beat the withdrawal ?
BERLIN: It 's a technique I read about . If you smoke 60 a day , you buy three packs , throw one cigar- ette away , and smoke 59 . Day 2 , you throw 2 away and smoke 58 ..
ROSS: Why do n't you throw them all away , and smoke none ?
BERLIN: Because it 's a ritual you got ta go through with . I 'm down to 10 .
ROSS: You want my advice ?
BERLIN: Maybe ?
ROSS: Find yourself a farmer 's daughte with nice big fucking tits , and shake that `` bye-bye . '' Send it to Sacramento , John .. I sniff grief ..
MARGIE: You 're all done except the floor .
BERLIN: You 're a saint , Margie , thanks ..
MARGIE: Do n't forget the wagon , Darlin ?
ROSS: You got ta stop smoking ..
BERLIN: I am stopping smoking
ROSS: I do n't mean this `` system '' shit that keeps you sucking , I mean stop .. I was exactly like you are .. I used to wake in the night - heart going so hard I coulda made love with my left tit .. If I can stop , you can ..
BERLIN: How 'd you do it , old man ?
ROSS: Someone bet me a dollar ..
BERLIN: A dollar ? .. Not worth giving up for a dollar ..
ROSS: Alright . I 'll bet you fifty ?
BERLIN: Fifty dollars ? You got a bet .
ROSS: What are you gon na do , Soldier ?
BERLIN: I 'm gon na dig up `` Jennifer . ''
ROSS: Chief , I got ta talk to ya about this fat lady ?
CITRINE: What about her ?
ROSS: She 's making my life a misery .. I wan na give her a lie-detector test ?
BERLIN: Laser enhancement of the finger- tip .. it 's really bothering me .. See these striations right here ? It 's like she 's always worrying the end of her finger ? Rubbing it with a thumb nail , or something ?
CITRINE: How do you know her hair 's black ?
BERLIN: Hair on her hand . Plus Jen- nifer had raven black hair .
CITRINE: What is all this Jennifer stuff ?
BERLIN: Yes , Sir , I think they maybe . I think `` Jennifer , '' and this lady got hit by the same guy ?
CITRINE: I do n't see that at all ..
BERLIN: I got four points of posit- ive comparison on the cut ..
CITRINE: Yeah , that 's all very inter- esting , but where 's the body ?
BISLEY: Just wondered if you had time to get around to my pharmacy stuff ?
BERLIN: You 'll have it in the morning ..
BISLEY: Alright , I 'll try again tomorrow .
CITRINE: Probably making him feel a bit antsy seein it back on the wall . He worked a lotta time on this .
BERLIN: I thought it was Taylor 's case ?
CITRINE: Sucked in officers from all ove the county . And it was the worst six months this station ever had .
BERLIN: What do you want me to do , Chief ?
CITRINE: I 'm not telling you what to do . What I will say , is right now , that child 's tricycle there is more important to me than this ..
ROSS: .. what does he think it is ?
BERLIN [ROSS]: Everything it is n't . He even tried a `` self-inflicted . ''
ROSS: It 's possible .
BERLIN: C'mon , Ross , the bra and hand were in different bags a 100 feet apart ..
ROSS: It 's the garage on the far corner .
BERLIN: What do you mean ?
ROSS: Worrying - clicking - picking - You may as well be back in Los Angeles .
BERLIN: What do you mean , Ross ?
ROSS: Why do n't you dump it ? Mail it off . Give the fucking F.B.I . a present ?
BERLIN: Why do n't you dump the `` Fat Lady ? ''
ROSS: Because I dislike her too much ..
BERLIN: O.K . and I 'm not in love with this fukker ? That 's how I feel about him .
ROSS: No you do n't . That 's how you think you feel about him . That 's how you feel about yourself . You wo n't give yourself one-fucking-minute for you .
BERLIN: I just had this insane idea - if I 'm wrong , I 'll take a week off and redecorate your entire house ..
ANN: Shasta-Trinity Institute . Line one .
ROSS: Pig Woman agreed to take a test .
BERLIN: I think I got something - twenty two years old , dark hair - study- ing mathematics - - Last seen 5 weeks ago ..
GOODRIDGE: As recent as we have .. What ex- actly is your interest in Amber ?
BERLIN: I 'm afraid I ca n't give you an ans- wer to that , Mr Goodridge . As I ex- plained to your secretary , we 're do- ing a lotta looking , but we 're not even sure it 's her we 're lookin for ..
GOODRIDGE: Then what are you hoping I 'm gon- na do ? Dissuade , or persuade you ?
BERLIN: I was hopin since we spoke that you might have remembered something that would give us an idea where she is ?
GOODRIDGE: Then you could have saved yourself a lot of driving , Sergeant . What I said on the phone 's the same as I 'm saying now . I got no idea where Amb- er is , or who it was took her there .
ROSS: A blind girl can just walk out of here , and you do n't know who with ?
GOODRIDGE: You find something curious in that ?
ROSS: Yeah , I guess I do .
GOODRIDGE: Then let me put your mind at ease .. Firstly , Amber is n't `` blind '' - she has some useful vision - and second , this is n't a prison , it 's a college of higher education - a severe vis- ual disability does n't mean my stud- ents do n't value their independence as much as anybody else - and Ambe was a very independent young woman - She decided to leave - so she left ..
ROSS: And you got no idea with who ?
GOODRIDGE: No , Sergeant , I got no idea with who . And I might add , that in another six weeks , a hundred and fifty students will be leaving here , & driving away for their Christmas holidays with pe- ople whose name I-won't-know-either ..
BERLIN: Yes , Sir .
GOODRIDGE: As she 's a member of my staff , may I ask what this is about ?
BERLIN: Well , apparently , she saw Amber the weekend she left , & was briefly in the room with the guy she left with .
GOODRIDGE: I see .. Well , she 's teaching an- other class at four .. I 'd apprec- iate it if you do n't detain her ..
ROSS: Where is everyone ?
BERLIN: I dunno .. I guess this is staff side of the building ?
HELENA: What d'you wan na ask , Mr Ross ?
BERLIN: I 'm Mr Berlin . Mr Ross is right here . And Mr Ross is maybe gon na take a few notes , if that 's O.K. ? O.K . .. I 'd like you to tell me in what ever way you want , what you can remember about the time you spent with Amber on the aft- ernoon she left ? Take your time , and nothing 's too trivial , O.K .
HELENA: Well , I think I told you on the phone .. I went up to her room to say good-bye , and we just sat on the bed and chatted a while , while her friend was coming in and out collecting her things ..
BERLIN: What kind of friend ? Was he a boy friend ? An old friend ? New friend ?
HELENA: Fifty-three .
BERLIN: You must have some idea about him .
HELENA: When we spoke on the phone , did you know I was blonde ?
BERLIN: No .
HELENA: Why not ? You heard my voice ?
BERLIN: John ? .. You never said that on the phone ? .. What makes you think his name was John ?
HELENA: I do n't know . I guess she must have called him John ? I 'm mak- ing tea . Would you like some ?
BERLIN: This looks promising .. I think this one could be it ?
ROSS: Thank Christ we got a witness .
BERLIN: Let me just keep going a while . She might remember something ?
ROSS: What ? She 's blind , Bro . You may as well ask one of these Beethoven guys on the piano ?
HELENA: Well , he just said , come on , hurry up , will you , because it 's starting to snow again .
BERLIN: The elevator was n't working ?
HELENA: No , it has a mind of its own .
BERLIN: Can I see your hands ?
HELENA: My hands ?
BERLIN: Is there anything else you can tell me ? Anything about him o her ? Does n't matter how small ?
HELENA: No . Except he smoked . Like you .
BERLIN: Me ?
HELENA: Yes , I could smell it on his eath , like I can on your 's .
BERLIN: D'you have a dog ? Seeing Eye Dog ?
HELENA: No .
BERLIN: Lotta scratch-marks on your door ?
HELENA: Sometimes I look after friends dogs , if they go to dances , or something ?
ROSS: Could I just refer you to this memo here , Sergeant ?
BERLIN: Did Amber have a dog ?
HELENA: Yes .
BERLIN: What color was it ?
HELENA: I do n't know .
BERLIN: .. if she writes , or calls , or any- thing at all , you let me know , O.K .
HELENA: Music composition .. and cello ..
ROSS: Fifty of em . And I want em now .
BERLIN: Had a seeing Eye Dog since she was eighteen .. did n't I tell you those dogs meant something ..
ROSS: No , you did n't .
BERLIN: Alright , I did n't , but I nearly did , and if I had I 'd have been ight .. I knew there was some- thing about that Labrador , that dog was too good to be dead .. We got ta get back up that dump ..
ROSS: No way .. not me , Mister . I 'm not going up there again . Might find someone 's prick in a hot-dog roll .
BERLIN: We 're going .
ROSS: Forget it . They got stringent hyg- iene rules . He 's long gone in lime .
BERLIN: Maybe not ? I 'm feeling lucky ..
ROSS: So am I . But where 's my money ?
BERLIN: Do n't start again . If you win a et , you ca n't keep winning it ..
ROSS: Pay me , and I shut up .
BERLIN: I have n't got it .
ROSS: Then give me that Zippo .
BERLIN: Why ?
ROSS: I need some security . I do n't trust you anymore .
BERLIN: I had one puff on a pipe .
ROSS: I do n't want excuses , I want that weird-looking stuff called `` cash . ''
BERLIN: What do you want it for ?
ROSS: To throw out of the window .
BERLIN: What are you doing , Ross ? I 've had that 15 years ! ..
ROSS: It 's not your friend . It keeps you sucking . Remem- er the old Bum 's lungs ?
BERLIN: I remember the old bastard 's liver ! I do n't believe you did that . I had a great sent- imental attachment to that .
ROSS: You want me to stop the car ?
BERLIN: No ! Get me to that garbage dump ! I 'm gon na find that fucking dog !
TRIMBLE: Me .. I love dogs .. Ask him ?
BERLIN: .. I put the slug in for a ballis- tics report , the man tells me , fo get it . Soft lead , it 's worthless .. I think , fuck it . And fuck Citrine . I call a friend of mine in Los Ang- eles , and he runs our whole damned show through a main-frame looking for anything similar to our ladies shot with a twenty-two - you do n't elieve what he finds in San Diego ..
ROSS: Alright , let 's take a walk around the block .. I got ta buy a gasket ..
BERLIN: Six girls over a period of 18 months , and give or take a head or two , the M.O . 's exactly the same . Dark hair . No hands . All shot with a high velocity twen- ty-two in the back of the head .
ROSS: How come the F.B.I . do n't put anya this together ? They work- ed over `` Jennifer '' for months ?
BERLIN: They possibly did - but they nev- er had a head , so they never had a bullet - and they never got an I.D . - not on any of em - neve ust a homicide unless you know who your victim is - we 're the first to get a positive identity .
ROSS: Identity of whom ? You got a girl , does n't even have a driver 's lic- ense ? .. She 's untraceable , John .. You need fifty detectives on this .
BERLIN: That 's what I 'm here for . I want you to come and see Citrine with me ? He 's not gon na here it from me but I know he 'd listen to you .
ROSS: Listen to me saying what ?
BERLIN: I wan na take that fucking Blind In- stitute to pieces .. Every address ook , every phone call , everyone in and outta there in the last 5 years ..
ROSS: For a dead dog ?
BERLIN: We 've fused into a major series , Ross . This girl is n't the second victim . This is `` Jennifer Eight . ''
ROSS: That is n't what you said before .
BERLIN: I was wrong .
ROSS: You 're not .. He 's in hospital .. He was trying out a new pair of skis in his hallway . The phone ings , and he goes for it , and falls off . He must be the only skier in Northern California to eak a leg in his living room .
BERLIN: You believe me , do n't you ?
ROSS: What does it matter what I bel- ieve ? .. What you got ta worry about is what Citrine believes ..
HELENA: Have you been here long ?
BERLIN: No , just a minute or two .. I knocked on your door - no one home , so I followed the music ..
HELENA: I 'm sorry . I 'll get my things .
BERLIN: No problem . I 'm not in a hurry .
HELENA: I do n't think so .. No one comes here at the weekends ..
BERLIN: Of course I would ..
HELENA: That 's alright . You suddenly eminded me of him .. He was standing right where you are , kind of breathless , like you .
BERLIN: I 'm sorry , someone slammed the door on me . I could n't get out .
HELENA: It was probably the wind .
BERLIN: What are you reading ?
HELENA: Hamlet . Have you read it ?
BERLIN: No .
HELENA: You should . It 's wonderful .
BERLIN: .. I 'll tell you what , if I prom- ise to stop being a cop , will you promise to stop being a witness ?
HELENA: Are you wearing a uniform ?
BERLIN: No .
HELENA: Oh .
BERLIN: Well , I 'm glad we got the conver- sational side of lunch over with .
HELENA: I 'm sorry .. I do n't like sitting in the middle of a restaurant .. I feel like everyone 's looking at me ..
BERLIN: There 's no one `` looking at you '' .. There 's hardly anyone in here . The only person looking at you , is me .
HELENA: Are you married ?
BERLIN: Was . But I do n't like to talk about it .
HELENA: You just asked me to ask you questions .
BERLIN: I know , but you pick on the one time in my life I like not to remember . I was in the bad lands . Really not well . It 's something that happens to a lota cops . We do n't wan na talk about that .
HELENA: `` Thoughts that lie too deep for tears . ''
BERLIN: Yeah , that 'll do .. Is that `` Hamlet ? ''
HELENA: No , Wordsworth .. Do you like poetry ?
BERLIN: I do n't know , I have n't read much . I do n't think poetry 's my kinda thing ?
HELENA: Do you pray ?
BERLIN: Pray ?
HELENA: You said , you were in the bad lands ?
BERLIN: No , I do n't pray .. Had a dream once , about God , just around the time I was getting well .. He was a nasty lookin little guy , moved into the apartment ight on topa me .. I said , do n't you listen to people 's prayers ? He said , prayers ? Not often . They 're Junk Mail .
HELENA: Sorry ?
BERLIN: .. sorry your father , mother sis- ter , whatever .. I could n't take another day of it .. Come on , I 'm gon na rob you of a cup of coffee ..
HELENA: Coz I wanted to feel the snow on my face .. I think that 's when I heard her call him John ?
BERLIN: No . Getting dark though .
HELENA: You 've already asked me that ..
BERLIN: Yes . I 'm sorry .
CITRINE: You 're pushing this too hard . It 's like you want me to say stop ? You must know that 's the way this is going , John ? There 's other work to do , why do n't ya ease off a little ?
BERLIN: Coz this is a major & we 're closer to this bastard than anyone 's ever been .
CITRINE: Then where 's the body ? .. Where 's the body , and why 's he hidden it ?
BERLIN: He has n't hidden it . He never made a hit this far north before , and he never read a weather forecast .. She 's probably fifteen feet from the highway , three feet under snow .
CITRINE: Have you got a match on the bullet ?
BERLIN: No .
CITRINE: Have you got a print from the hand ?
BERLIN: No , Sir .
CITRINE: It could be anyone 's hand . Illeg- ally disposed of hospital debris ..
BERLIN: It 's her hand . Her scars . Her dog . Her dog 's shot . And she 's missing .
CITRINE: She 's not `` missing . '' Did she shout ? Did she scream ? Did he coerce her ? No . She left of her own free will .. And if she gets on a plane and goes to Peru with the prick , she 's still not missing . You got no case , John .
BERLIN: If you 're not gon na hear me , Chief ..
CITRINE: I have heard you . You just do n't like hearing me . You got this whole damned thing outta proportion . I do n't know what you gotten used to in Los Angeles , ut I do n't believe there 's a Police Chief , in this country , would put a task force together for a body part ..
BERLIN: We have a multiple homicide , Sir ..
CITRINE: We have a body part in suspicious circumstances - a tailor 's dummy wearing a brassiere - and a bill for seventeen dollars for its wig !
ROSS: Did he shut you down ?
BERLIN: All but .. How you doing ?
ROSS: I dunno , I dare n't go in there - just about get her wired up , and the fucking mayor walks in - mad as hell - what are we doing fuck- ing with his staff ? We should be out chasing major violators ..
BERLIN: I wish he 'd tell that to Citrine .
ROSS: Did I say he did ?
BERLIN: You looked like you did ?
ROSS: No , I think you 'll find I looked like he could have ? By accident even ? He 's up here spraying the scenery all day .
BERLIN: He did n't shoot it , Ross . And no way by accident . There 's a flash-burn . It was point-blank .
SERATO: Flying colors
ROSS: Say you did n't say that , Angelo ?
SERATO: I said it .
ROSS: Oh my God Mother 's shit . Are we in it ?
EXPERT: This is the important one . She gets a dead straight line , and that 's an exceptional reading ..
SERATO: .. this is the stupidest thing we ever done . Fucking Citrine 's gon na fire one of us for this ..
ROSS: I ca n't believe it . I just know she someway busted it .
EXPERT: This is an honest girl . She could n't lie if she tried ..
BERLIN: Is she lying , Ross ?
ROSS: Yes .
BERLIN: My name 's Sergeant John Berlin .
EMERSON: What d'ya mean , Sergeant ?
BERLIN: Well , look at it . Look at this line ? That 's the important one . Dead straight down the page . No- ody gets a dead straight down the page . Even our expert says a dead straight 's `` exceptional . ''
EMERSON: I was n't actually lying , Officer .
BERLIN: You busted the box , lady ! You flunk- ed it .. You lied about things you did n't need to lie about .. The only truthful statement you made 's you name .. Your name is Carol Emerson ?
MARGIE: Such a shame .. She 's a really sweet kid ..
ROSS: She 's a doll . But I wish he had n't brought her out here .
MARGIE: He 's happy , darlin ..
ROSS: I 'm sure he is . But gettin in- to the `` element '' is a bad idea .
MARGIE: You want something , darling ?
ROSS: I would n't mind another B.E.E.R .
BERLIN: I 'm doing it by the day
MARGIE: She 's in Europe ..
BERLIN: Working ?
ROSS: She married some English prick .
MARGIE: He 's not that bad of a guy .. ?
ROSS: Got a handshake like a partially excited penis .
MARGIE: Her loss , darlin ..
ROSS: Why 's she blind , Bro ?
BERLIN: Car accident .
ROSS: No shit .
BERLIN: It 's been a great day .
ROSS: You just go easy , Brother Alright , we 're all goin home .
HELENA: I know what you 're like ..
BERLIN: How d'you know what I 'm like ?
HELENA: Ross told me .
BERLIN: Really ? What did he say ?
HELENA: He said you 're quite chubby . And you have a nervous tick .
BERLIN: He said that ? What else did he say ?
HELENA: Just your age .
BERLIN: Which is what ?
HELENA: Fifty-seven .. I do n't mind ..
BERLIN: You wan na drive ? C'mon we 're in a car park , miles from any- where .. There 's nothing arou- nd but nothing and sand dunes ..
HELENA: That was the `` Hollow Car , '' John .
BERLIN: A Volkswagen van ? Are you sure ?
CITRINE: I 'm shutting you down on this `` blind thing , '' John .
BERLIN: Is that my punishment fo embarrassing Mr Heineman ?
CITRINE: Do n't underestimate me .. the Mayor 's pissed - but that 's nothing to do with this - sit down - How many times have you een up at that institute ?
BERLIN: Three or four .
CITRINE: I 'm talking , outside the girl ?
BERLIN: Once .
CITRINE: Got a letter from this Goodridge guy ? Says , you 're upsetting his students ?
BERLIN: That 's bullshit ,
CITRINE: He says , you freaked one of em out ? `` Asking a newly blind kid if he can 'see , ' is both cruel , and dangerous '' ..
BERLIN: I never asked if he could `` see . '' I just asked one or two of the stud- ents if they remembered anything ?
CITRINE: And did they ?
BERLIN: No .
CITRINE: I 'm not a nasty man , John , I 'm a nice man .. I get a lot of Christmas cards .. and I 'm getting a lot of complaints . The guy you replaced was something you- 're not - a lazy sonovabitch - but the eality is , I was getting a faster ser- vice outta Popeye than I am outta you .. I ca n't allow this to continue , John ..
BERLIN: God , it pisses me off , Ross .
ROSS: No God , Brother . If there was a God , asses would n't be at the perfect height for kicking .
VENABLES: Can I buy you a beer , Sergeant ?
ROSS: Do n't try and ingratiate your- self with me , Venables . But just this once I 'll have a Heineken .. and John here will have one , too .
TAYLOR: No , I got ta go .. I 'm nights ..
BLATTIS: Gim me a ride ?
TAYLOR: Sure ..
ROSS: Hey , we 're not talking `` talk '' tonight .
TAYLOR: No one 's gon na make that Gent . Six months investigation , & the nearest we got , we thought he was a sailor .
BERLIN: A sailor ?
TAYLOR: Yeah , in and outta Frisco on the big boats .. Every lead we had went right out to sea .. Night , night , Freddy T .. John ..
BERLIN: How come he 's suddenly so forth- coming ? I 'd like to kick him right in the ass . If he 'd discussed it with me , I mighta gotten somewhere ..
ROSS: Stop it .
BERLIN: I never knew about the sailor the- ory , Ross . He might have that one little thing I need in his files ?
ROSS: John , stop it . The case is on its ass , you 're closed . C'mon , let it go for once .. Have a drink . C'mon , relax , drink your beer ..
BERLIN: Just makes to so God damned mad ..
ROSS: You 're a fucking great policeman , but give yourself a break . You 're here 5 minutes , you find yourself a fucking homicide ? .. Not many people could do that in a place like this .. And you got ta admit , there 's a lot of shaky areas in this case ? .. I mean , stop me if I 'm going up the wrong nostril ..
BERLIN: She was n't lying about the van .
ROSS: Alright , she was n't lying about the van . But it could have been any van ? Any little foreign diesel ? .. She 's lind , Bro .. It 's sad .. She 's pro- ably lonely , and you 're a nice guy to have around .. But you 're getting far too far into the element , Brother ..
BERLIN: Sure .
ROSS: You do n't need me to tell you what hap- pens when you get emotionally involved ?
BERLIN: Alright , enough , Ross . You 'll ing on my `` Nervous Tick ''
TAYLOR: What are you looking for ?
BERLIN: Vehicle references .
TAYLOR: Wrong cabinet .
HELENA: I wanted it to be a surprise .
BERLIN: I have to talk to you , Helena .
HELENA: I know .
BERLIN: You know ? How do you know ?
HELENA: Coz you hardly said a word since you got here . But you been thinking pretty loud ..
BERLIN: Got your driver 's license ?
WOMAN: Oh , it was you that nearly ran into me ?
BERLIN: No , it was you that nearly ran into me .. You up there a lot ?
WOMAN: I guess , more than usual this time of the year . My mother & I un an Arts & Crafts center , we uy a lot from the institutes ..
BERLIN: Where 's your store , Amanda ?
WOMAN: Oakland .
BERLIN: Next pit-stop , you make sure you doors are locked . Merry Christmas .
TAYLOR: Just easy on the words you 're putting in my face , Sergeant ..
ROSS: Whass going on here ?
TAYLOR: His blind friend got `` attacked . '' Angelo went up there , and some- how , it got itself in the paper .
BERLIN: You put it in there .
TAYLOR: I may have said some- thing . I do n't recall .
BERLIN: Do n't lie , Taylor . I just had this Blattis guy on the phone asking me for a comment - you gave him the whole damned case !
TAYLOR: Alright , I gave him the case ? .. So the case is closed , so what ?
BERLIN: So read it ! You just hung a target around her neck !
TAYLOR: Bullshit .
BERLIN: Do n't you know nothing about this guy ? He reads the newspapers . Col- lects the cuttings . When are they gon na find her ? Now he 's reading Helena Robertson 's name , phrased like she 's a fucking witness . You could n't have done anything more stupid if you 'd sat down & tried ..
TAYLOR: Hey , c'mon , country boys , let 's all line up and hear the expert .
BERLIN: Just walk away from me , Taylor ..
TAYLOR: You think you 're the only guy ever worked a homicide ? I was a big-city cop too . And I bust- ed the clock on fucken Jennifer . I know more about this man than you 'll over know - and that 's how I know it ai n't him - you- 're investigating a soap-opera ..
ROSS: Alright , guys . We stop this now .
TAYLOR: He tells her , `` bye-bye , '' and she gets `` attacked . '' Well , give me a fucking break ! There is no `` Ser- ial Killer . '' Stick her name up in neon , there 's still no Serial kil- ler ! And I ai n't the only one say- ing it . Everyone in this building is saying it . And I mean everyone .
ROSS: Shut up , King Jay ..
TAYLOR: No , c'mon , Freddy , let 's have this out & over . You know what everyone thinks ? They think you 're making a case coz you found yourself a nice piece of ass . And no one 's blaming you for it , I hear she 's worth the flowers . But do n't come in here get- ting holy over us . Sure I put it in the paper . Coz I wanted to stop this ullshit . I do n't want you drunk out- ta your head searching my office ag- ain . it 's pissing me , & everyone off .
BERLIN: You do n't know what you done , Taylor .
TAYLOR: If , your friend from San Diego was up here , and thought for one out of two fucken seconds , she was a dange to him , he'da taken her out weeks ago ..
BERLIN: I know what a `` witness '' is .
TAYLOR: Well , her , it ai n't . That bitch is blind as a blonde fucken bat .
BERLIN: I 'm gon na do something you neve did , Taylor . I 'm gon na catch this astard . And when I do , he 's gon- na find out just how good a `` wit- ness '' she is .. Meanwhile , you be aware of me - coz I wish you ill ..
ROSS: I 'm not in here to apologize , John . I told you what was gon na happen & it 's happened ? `` Good-bye , Princess , '' & the same night she gets attacked ? That 's a tough one to swallow , Bro ?
BERLIN: I 'm already familiar with Taylor 's opinion .
ROSS: You do n't really believe this ?
BERLIN: One hundred fucking per cent ! .. And you know why ? Coz I neve told her good-bye . O.K. ? Is that good enough for the `` committee ? ''
ROSS: Well .. I did n't know that ..
BERLIN: No .. You did n't know that ..
ROSS: Who d'you think it was ?
BERLIN: That 's a very stupid question , Ross .
ROSS: I 'm asking it .
BERLIN: How the hell do I know who ? Some jerk-off . Some peeping-tom prick .
ROSS: Ease off , John ..
BERLIN: I 'm sick of this toy town shit .
ROSS: Everything you say sounds reason- able . But there 's also a reason- able explanation for the opposite .
BERLIN: Do n't give me that ! Not anothe word ! When you had the Fat Lady in there , and I asked you if she was lying , you looked me right in the eyes and said yes . So as far as I was concerned , she 's ly- ing . And if the King of fucking England had walked in & told me different , I would n't have bel- ieved him - because you told me ..
ROSS: I dunno what I can do to help you ?
BERLIN: I dunno what I 'd do with your help . I 've got ta take her out of there ..
ROSS: What about Citrine ?
BERLIN: Screw Citrine . He can fire me .
HELENA: I do n't think so .. He said the police had been calling .. want- ed to ask me some more questions ..
BERLIN: Who ? Probably Angelo .. I 'll take care of it .. Do n't worry , we- 're gon na find this guy , and everything 'll be O.K . .. O.K . ?
HELENA: No I 'm not .
BERLIN: You 're looking more worried now than when you `` decided to stop worrying '' ?
HELENA: Alright , I 'm worried about Christmas . I wish I had n't told him I 'd be back ..
BERLIN: He 'll get over it . I 'll roast us a chicken , O.K . With cand- les around it . How about that ?
HELENA: Would n't it be better if I cook it ? You said , you can only boil ?
BERLIN: Ca n't thank you enough , Ross ..
ROSS: Do n't thank me . Thank Margie .
MARGIE: Not `` you '' blue . This is n't you .
HELENA: When did John divorce ?
MARGIE: Two or three years ago .
HELENA: What was she like ?
MARGIE: Suzanne ? Very pretty . She was a semi- professional model . But a policeman 's wife she was n't . So one day , she just packed it and left . And his whole life went straight down the nearest toilet .
HELENA: What does that mean ?
MARGIE: You know , he crashed . He just could n't come to terms with it .. John hates to lose , and he hated losing her .. Every spare minute , he 's driving down to San Diego , having a terrible time with her , getting drunk , and driving back .. you just do n't believe the amount he drank ..
HELENA: You think he still loves her ?
MARGIE: Think he still thinks about her . But not like then . Then was an obsession .
HELENA: I have n't worn heels since I was 16 . I do n't think I could walk in these ?
MARGIE: Sure you can . Anyway , parties are all about standing still ..
HELENA: You think John would like it ?
MARGIE: I think John , would love it
ROSS: Let 's do one of these right now , then we 'll hide the sonovabitch .
SERATO: Duty Sergeant fucked up .. can you believe it , I 'm on tonight ..
BERLIN: No .
SERATO: I left a message on your machine . It was n't me calling . Sam around ?
ROSS: Yeah .. I guess she 's in the kit- chen .. We got a so-called prof- essional cook out there having a nervous breakdown over a turkey ..
BERLIN: Are you sure you did n't call ?
SERATO: I spoke to old whass-his-name a couple of times . But not to her , and I never asked for her ..
ROSS: Her who ?
BERLIN: Someone 's calling the institute to talk to Helena . Says he wants to ask her some more questions ..
SERATO: Not guilty ..
BERLIN: You got a quiet phone somewhere ?
ROSS: Hey , John , do n't start getting antsy over this tonight . It may well have been the local cops ?
BERLIN: That 's just what I wan na find out .
MARGIE: How you doing on those shoes ?
HELENA: Do n't mix very well with beer .
MARGIE: Girl like you should be drinking chill white wine . Press . All done .
BOBBY: That woman in the kitchen says if she does n't get help within 10 seconds , she 's gon na resign .
MARGIE: That woman is a disaster
BOBBY: I 'll just go see if he 's in the kitchen .. you stay right here ..
VENABLES: Hey , Popeye !
POPEYE: Hey , Fat Guy ! Gim me 2 minutes . I 'm about to ask this lady for a dance ?
HELENA: I know what you look like . Excuse me .
FLESHY VOICE: Happy Christmas , Max
MAX: I normally get socks
MARGIE: She wants to go back to the institute ..
ROSS: I know .. ai n't it a shame ..
HELENA: I ca n't walk in these shoes ..
BERLIN: Jesus . What are you doin ?
ROSS: I spose I 'm drinking myself to sleep . It 's Helena 's Christmas songs .. they 're really pretty ..
BERLIN: Have you got any Glasers ? Twenty fives ?
ROSS: What exactly you doing , John ?
BERLIN: I 'm going up to the institute .
ROSS: Now ?
BERLIN: This `` cop '' that 's calling , thinks she gon na be there over Christmas .
ROSS: Well , let 's hope he does ..
BERLIN: Listen , you do n't havta come ?
ROSS: Hey ..
BERLIN: I guess by the bed .
ROSS: It 's twenty of three .
BERLIN: Bull shit .. I 'm in my prime ..
ROSS: Bits .
BERLIN: What d'you mean , `` bits . ''
ROSS: Policemen 's bodies age at diff- erent rates . Look at me . Gut in its fifties . Balls in their six- ties . And feet in their eighties ..
BERLIN: Hit those wipers , Ross .
ROSS: What if we need a back up ?
BERLIN: We 're not here . I do n't want the desk to hear us ..
ROSS: You ai n't going in alone ?
BERLIN: That 's a liability , Ross . I do n't want you hanging on to my shirt . Anyone but me comes down these stairs , take em out ut try and keep him alive . I want this bastard living ..

HELENA: Why ?
BERLIN: Please do n't ask no quest- ions now .. Not right now ..
HELENA: Is that Margie ?

ROSS: Twenty-six minutes past two ..
BERLIN: You should n't have come , Ross .
ROSS: Do n't worry .. You take you time .. I just wan na be back in time for Bobby 's presents ..

TRAVIS: Yes , Sir .

CITRINE: It 's either you , or Taylor ?
BISLEY: He do n't wan na do it either .
CITRINE: I 'll toss a coin for you . But one of you is going in today ..
BERLIN: I need a friend , Angelo .
SERATO: You got one .
HELENA: Do n't say that . Do n't you dare say that .. I believe you ..
BERLIN: I know you 're trying to help me , but you do n't understand .
HELENA: Then explain it to me . I got enough darkness , do n't I ?
BERLIN: The man who killed Amber is a psychopath . He was up at the in- stitute to kill you - he do n't wan na kill Rose - he was there to kill you - that 's the truth - and I did n't wan na tell it to you - but that 's the reason I want you to stay at Margie 's - coz I ca n't protect you here ..

HELENA: You got ta stop drinking , darling .
BERLIN: He does n't need my help .
HELENA: I know about alcohol , John .
BERLIN: You do ?

AMANDA: As I said , Sergeant , you nearly an into me ? What 's the problem ?
BERLIN: I 'm afraid it 's the `` van '' again .
AMANDA: The van ?
BERLIN: Is it your vehicle ?
AMANDA: No , my mother 's .. You better stop in .. I 'm just here to feed the cat .
BERLIN: I 'm sorry to worry you with this , but we had a real serious robbery , and we- 're chasing a white V.W . van ? You guy came up an the computer , so as a matt- er of routine we have to check . Could you tell me who 's driven it recently ?

BERLIN [AMANDA]: Would he have lent it to anyone ? How bout your Dad ? Husband ? Boyfriend ?
AMANDA: He is my boyfriend . My fath- er 's dead , and I 'm divorced .

AMANDA: Could I see your badge again ?
TAYLOR: We 're not gon na find nothin here .

RAYMUNDO: Rec time in five minutes , Needy .
NEEDY: Grassy-ass , Raymundo .
NEEDY: I 'm sorry I did n't do it sooner .
NUTRITIONIST: Just one Toastem , huh ?
NEEDY: I like Toastems .
NUTRITIONIST: That 's good . But I 'm not sure a Toastem can provide you with sufficient energy for your day . I 'd recommend more complex carbohydrates
NEEDY: This is where it all went down . `` Devil 's Kettle '' sounds twisted , I know , but the place just is named after a dumb waterfall .
JENNIFER: Huh ?
NEEDY: You 'll throw me a bone , huh ? Huh ? You killed Chip ! You goddamned monster ! YouZOMBITCH !
JENNIFER: Do you buy all your murder weapons at Home Depot ? God , you 're butch .
NEEDY: Know what this is for ? Cutting oxes .
HYSTERICAL: CROSS OUT JENNIFER !
JENNIFER: My tit !
MRS. CHECK: Jennifer ! What is it , baby ? Oh my God ! Oh my God !
SHOCKED: Needy ?
NEEDY: Is she dead , Mrs . Check ? Did I get her ?
ROMAN: Christ , Needy , what have you done ?
NEEDY: Hi , Roman ! How 's the Force treating you ? I like that jaunty cap . Blue like your balls .
ROMAN: How could you do this , Needy ?
EMOTIONAL: You killed Jen Jennifer I mean , the victim . Are you on something ?
NEEDY: Everything 's going to be okay now . I rule .
FEMALE COP: Shut your mouth back there !
NEEDY: Hey . Did n't you used to baby-sit me in like 1998 ? When my mom worked the overnight at Hormel ? The female cop fidgets uncomfortably .
FEMALE COP: You 're one to talk about utality , Ms. Lesnicki . You 're looking at attempted murder .
NEEDY: Ugh , do n't say attempted . That sounds so JV . Small time . Teeny- weeny , just like Officer Duda up there . And trust me I 'd know .
FEMALE COP: She 's delirious .
ROMAN: This is going to be a circus .
FEMALE COP: At least we 've already got a confession .
NEEDY: Confessions are for pussies . You 've got a declaration , Grace . She giggles maniacally .
ROMAN: God , I love this song .
FEMALE COP: I know . And they 've done so much for this town .
ROMAN: They 're way more than a band , eally . They 're heroes .
FEMALE COP: Wait , this is my favorite part
CHASTITY: You 're totally lesbigay .
NEEDY: What ? She 's my best friend .
CHASTITY: You stare at her like you want to dry hump her . Needy ignores her .
NEEDY: Are you jealous ?
CHASTITY: Of what ? That rich bitch ?
NEEDY: She 's not rich .
JENNIFER: Hey , Monistat .
NEEDY: What 's up , Vagisil ?
JENNIFER: You and me are going out tonight .
NEEDY: Tonight ? Why ?
JENNIFER: Soft Shoulder are playing at the Carousel .
NEEDY: What 's Soft Shoulder ?
JENNIFER: They 're this indie band from the city . I saw their MySpace and the singer is extra salty . And there will be lots of other salty morsels there for you . Come on Needy , it 's the weekend !
NEEDY: It 's Thursday .
JENNIFER: Thursday counts as the weekend in college . And we 're going to be in college twenty-three months from now . University of Northern Minnesota Duluth- woo ! Needy continues loading her backpack .
NEEDY: I have to study .
JENNIFER: Boo ! Cross out Needy !
NEEDY: Fine . What time is the show ?
JENNIFER: I 'll pick you up at 8 30 . My mom has a date with that guy who owns the ham store .
NEEDY: He seems nice .
JENNIFER: Yeah , Mom says he 's got a huge heart . So huge he gave her a ecurring bladder infection . Wea something cool , okay ?
NEEDY: Okay .
CHIP: Those jeans are hella low . I can almost see your front butt .
NEEDY: Chip , it 's a rock show . This is my ock look .
CHIP: I can see , like , your womb . Needy sighs and hoists up her pants .
NEEDY: Jennifer needs me . She really wants to go see this band . It 's extremely important to her .
CHIP: I 've never even heard of Soft Shoulder . Which one is Jennife stalking ?
NEEDY: The lead singer , of course . Girls like her do n't go out with drummers .
CHIP: Thanks a lot !
NEEDY: No offense . I mean , she 'd probably make an exception for a drumme who was also the lead singer .
CHIP: Like Phil Collins .
NEEDY: Who 's Phil Collins ?
CHIP: Forget it . He 's seminal , but whatever
NEEDY: Anyway , this singer guy is like 22 , so he could get locked up in the state pen if he actually dated her . But Jennifer says he 's extra salty , so
CHIP: Salty . You guys ever going to stop using that secret language ?
NEEDY: `` Salty '' means beautiful .
CHIP: Then you must be soy sauce , babe .
NEEDY: Jennifer 's here .
CHIP: How do you know ?
JENNIFER: Needy , quit tampooning yourself and get down here !
CHIP: That 's fucking weird .
NEEDY: ( straightening he
CLOTHES: I 'd better hurry .
CHIP: You always do what Jennifer tells you to do .
NEEDY: She 's my best friend , Chip . Remember ? This necklace is no joke . CHIP sighs , resigned . They head downstairs .
JENNIFER: Guess who 's got the whip ` til 11 30 ? A 2003 Chrysler Sebring and it 's all mine .
NEEDY: Wow .
JENNIFER: You 're lucky you get to ride with me to the club in style !
CHIP: I think you forgot , like , two uttons .
NEEDY: I think she remembered two uttons .
JENNIFER: It smells like Thai food in here .
BEAT: Have you guys been fucking ?
NEEDY: You 're gross !
JENNIFER: Okay , let 's go to the club .
CHIP: The Carousel is not a club .
JENNIFER: Eat my ass , Chip . You 're just jello ` cause you 're not invited .
CHIP: I 'm not jello ! That place is gross . Everyone there has a mustache .
JENNIFER: You 're totally jello ! You 're lime green jello and you ca n't even admit it . The girls scamper toward the car .
CHIP: Stop kidnapping my girlfriend !
JENNIFER: God , I ca n't wait until I 'm old enough to get wasted . Have you ever had peach schnapps ?
NEEDY: I do n't think so .
JENNIFER: Peach schnapps are excellent . They even taste good when they come out of your nose mid-puke . A teenage guy , CRAIG , passes by and waves .
CRAIG: Hi Jennifer . You look nice .
JENNIFER: What up , Craig . She elbows Needy and makes a GAGGING GESTURE .
NEEDY: Hey , it 's Ahmet from India . The foreign exchange guy . He 's all by himself .
JENNIFER: I ca n't believe we traded a cute hockey player for that .
NEEDY: He seems okay . He 's got that cool elephant statue in his locker .
JENNIFER: Do you think he 's circumcised ? I always wanted to try sea cucumber .
NEEDY: Ew !
ROMAN: You 're smoking dicks now , Jen ?
JENNIFER: What ? I like the Wides .
ROMAN: I just bet you do . I should arrest you for possession under the legal age .
JENNIFER: Arrest me , pfft ! You 're not even out of the academy yet , Roman !
ROMAN: Two more months and I 'm on the force for real . Then I 'll be able to cuff you whenever the hell I want .
JENNIFER: How will I wait that long ?
ROMAN: Not here , babe . I got ta keep my nose clean .
NEEDY: Look , there 's the band !
JENNIFER: You can tell they 're from the city .
ROMAN: Yeah , ` cause they look like a unch of faygos .
JENNIFER: You would think that . You 're such a small-time Gomer . I wish we had more guys like that in Devil 's Kettle . All stylish and shit .
NEEDY: They look so so cool .
JENNIFER: Hey , I think they need two groupies . Come on ! It 'll be like Almost Famous ! I 'll be Penny Lane and you can be the other girl .
NEEDY: No !
JENNIFER: Do n't be J.V. , Needy . They 're just oys . Morsels . We have all the power , do n't you know that ? She plants her hands on Needy 's CHEST .
NIKOLAI: I 'm Nikolai Wolf , and this is my and .
JENNIFER: Yeah ! Soft Shoulder , right ? I 've heard you guys are super , supe good at playing your instruments .
NIKOLAI: I hope we can live up to suchhigh praise .
NEEDY: Hey , if you do n't mind me asking , why did you want to play all the way out here in Devil 's Kettle ? You live in the city , right ?
NIKOLAI: Yeah . But I think it 's so important to connect with our fans in rural areas . Plus , the audiences in small towns really appreciate us .
JENNIFER: Can I show you my appreciation ight now ? Needy looks at the floor , embarrassed .
NIKOLAI: Mmm . Jennifer hurries off toward the bar .
DIRK: Who , Training Bra Jones ?
NIKOLAI: No , the hot one . The one who just walked away . She 's it , man . She 's exactly what we 're looking for .
DIRK: You 're sure she 's
NIKOLAI: She 's a kid . We 're in God 's country , man . Everyone out here 's a fundie bible-banger . Of course she 's a virgin . Dirk hesitates .
DIRK: Fine . Okay . You know , I know I 'm not `` just the bassist . '' I 'm a person who happens to play the ass guitar . And I would like some espect
JENNIFER: What ? Are you scared of rock stars too ?
NEEDY: Those guys are rank , Jen . Just forget about it .
JENNIFER: I think the singer wants me .
NEEDY: Only because he thinks you 're a virgin . I heard them talking .
JENNIFER: Yeah , right ! I 'm not even a ackdoor-virgin anymore , thanks to Roman . By the way , that hurts . I could n't even go to flags the next day . I had to stay home and sit on a bag of frozen peas .
NEEDY: Oh my God .
JENNIFER: Well , if Nikolai wants innocent , I can do innocent . I 'll be Little Miss Fucking Sunshine .
NEEDY: He 's way too old for you .
JENNIFER: Do n't cock-block me , Needy .
NIKOLAI: Good evening , Devil 's Lake . Someone in the back shouts `` Devil 's Kettle ! ''
NEEDY: I know where to go !
JENNIFER: It 's so hot , Needy . I think I 'm on fire . Oh God , I 'm burning !
NEEDY: You 're okay , I promise . You got urned worse when you wore that tin-foil bikini to the beach . Everything 's fine .
NIKOLAI: Are you girls all right ?
NEEDY: We 're great . Maybe you should try to find your band ?
NIKOLAI: Those guys ? They were the first ones out the door . Ran for the van like a bunch of Marys . Frankly , I 'm ashamed of them . Needy narrows her eyes suspiciously .
JENNIFER: Okayokay She slumps against Nikolai 's chest .
NIKOLAI: You 're in shock . Here , drink this . You 'll feel better .
NEEDY: Are n't you a little freaked out about this ? What about all you stuff ? It 's probably melting , and when you get to the next stop you 'll have to do like , a crappy acoustic set ! Nobody likes that .
NIKOLAI: We 'll be able to afford new gea soon enough . I have a feeling we 're gon na blow up .
JENNIFER: I want to see your van . C'mon Needy , let 's go to the van .
NEEDY: Why ? Why should we ? We have the Malibu . Let 's just get out of here . We can go to El Ojo and get Northwoods Nachos with extra Badger Sauce ! Please ? I 'm starving .
JENNIFER: Needy , stop it . Just stop it !
CHIP: Hey , Niedermeyer .
NEEDY: Thank God you 're there . I hoped you were sleeping with your phone .
CHIP: What 's wrong ?
NEEDY: Jennifer 's gone . She ran off with that rock band . And the Carousel urned down . CHIP sits bolt upright
CHIP: Like , burned down ? To the ground ? Is everyone okay ?
NEEDY: No . I think they 're mostly dead .
CHIP: Shit . You 're okay , right ?
NEEDY: We went out the bathroom window . Everyone else was trying to use the door . It was like a stampede . The people who fainted got run over and you could hear thei ones breaking .
CHIP: This is real , right ? This is n't just , like , some crazy dream like last time ?
NEEDY: No ! Anyway , it took me like an hour to walk home . But Jennifer 's still with those creeps ! They had one of those white molester vans with no windows . The back was all lacked out .
CHIP: Who cares about Jennifer and those douchebags with douchebag haircuts ? People just burned to death . In our town !
NEEDY: Oh cheese and fries ! Someone 's here . I 'm alone , Chip . I 'm freaked out !
CHIP: Where 's your mom ?
NEEDY: Swing shift . Listen , I 'll call you in a minute . Stay awake .
CHIP: Holla back .
NEEDY: Um , Jennifer ?
TREMBLING: J-Jen ?
JENNIFER: Are you scared ? Needy nods .
NEEDY: Jennifer ! But she 's long gone .
GOSSIPING GIRL: I heard Needy and Jennifer were there and they had to fight thei way out with a machete .
OTHER GIRL: Look , she 's not even moving .
GOSSIPING GIRL: It 's called Post Traumatic Stress Disorder
JENNIFER: Happy Friday ! , D-bag !
NEEDY: You you 're all right !
JENNIFER: Yeah . Why would n't I be ?
NEEDY: Last night . At my house . You were hurt . You had two black eyes and lood everywhere and
JENNIFER: Needy , you 're delusional . I got a little banged up when you made me go out that window , but I 'm fine .
NEEDY: We had to go out that window . The ar was like , engulfed in flames !
JENNIFER: You do have a tendency to overreact . Remember at Girl Scout camp when you thought there was an earthquake and it was really just two guys with a ghetto blaster ?
NEEDY: A lot of people died , Jennifer . They burned to death , or they choked , or they just got trampled . More than half of the people there did n't make it out . It 's like , all over the news . National news . Kids are dead . Parents are dead .
JENNIFER: Anyone we know ?
NEEDY: We know everyone !
JENNIFER: Sucks to be them , I guess .
NEEDY: I do n't get it . What 's wrong with you ?
JENNIFER: What 's wrong with you ? I mean , esides the obvious surface flaws .
NEEDY: There 's no way I dreamed it . No way .
JENNIFER: Do n't talk to yourself . It 's one of your more freakish Needy ehaviors and it makes us both look like total gaylords .
SMIRKING: Here comes Handi-Snack .
MR. WROBLEWSKI: I 'm sure those of you who made it here today have all heard the news . It 's a dark day for Devil 's Kettle , a day we can never , eve forget .
JENNIFER: No way ! Parrish ate shit ?
MR. WROBLEWSKI: This tragedy is obviously beyond anything we can measure . More than ever , we need to band together and draw strength from each other .
JENNIFER: Oh look , they 're united in grief . That 'll last .
CHIP: No band practice today .
NEEDY: No anything today .
CHIP: It 's surreal , right ? I mean , when just one guy dies in Devil 's Kettle , it 's like time stops . And now so many people are dead , nobody knows when it 's okay to start again .
NEEDY: I feel guilty just breathing .
CHIP: Word .
NEEDY: Chip , I need to tell you something kind of weird . It 's about Jennifer .
CHIP: What ?
NEEDY: You know last night when we were talking and someone came to my door ? That was Jennifer . But she did n't talk . She just stood there , smiling at me , but a bad kind of smile . She looked like she 'd been eat up or shot or something . She was all bloody .
CHIP: Yuck . Like those porcupine meatballs my mom makes with the ice sticking out ?
NEEDY: Yeah , like almost that bad !
CHIP: It was probably because she inhaled a whole bunch of smoke .
NEEDY: No . It was something evil .
CHIP: You might want to talk to the school shrink , Needy . I 'm not saying that to be a dillhole . I 'm actually kinda concerned .
NEEDY: Chip , I 'm a National Merit Scholar . I do n't tell whoppers and I 'm not crazy .
CHIP: I did n't say you were crazy . It 's just that everyone 's a little messed up about this . It 's okay to feel
NEEDY: Discombobulated ?
CHIP: Yeah , you know . Fucked up .
COLIN: Hi Needy .
NEEDY: Oh . Hi , Colin .
COLIN: I heard you were there last night . In the fiery trenches .
NEEDY: Uh-huh .
COLIN: Well , I 'm glad you made it out . Really .
NEEDY: Thanks .
CHIP: How are you friends with Colin Gray ? I thought Colin Gray only talked to the Dead Girls .
NEEDY: I just am . We have Composition together . He 's a really good writer . You know he 's so dark and emotional and all .
CHIP: Oh . I can relate . I 'm also like that , even if I 'm not all obvious about it like a poseur .
NEEDY: Walk me home ?
CHIP: You know it .
JENNIFER: Hi !
JONAS: Oh . Hey , Jennifer .
JENNIFER: I 'm crazy-sorry about you profound loss . You are crying about Craig , right ?
JONAS: He was my best friend .
JENNIFER: I know . I was close to him too . You know , I was there last night in that horrible place . I saw Craig a few minutes before the fire broke out .
JONAS: You you did ?
JENNIFER: Yeah . I was probably the last person to talk to him . Like , ever . Literally .
JONAS: Wow . What did he say ?
JENNIFER: Well , we got to talking about you , actually . And do you know what he said ? He said you were like a other to him . Not a bro . An actual brother .
JONAS: I just ca n't believe he 's gone .
JENNIFER: I know , I know .
BEAT: Hey , you know what else Craig said ?
JONAS: What ?
JENNIFER: Forget it . It 's too intense .
JONAS: What ? Please , Jen , you 've got ta tell me !
JENNIFER: Well , he said he always thought you and me would make a totally angin ' couple . Is n't that so weird ?
JONAS: He said bangin ' ?
JENNIFER: Feel my heart , Jonas . I think it 's oken .
JONAS: Mine too .
JENNIFER: Come with me . Just for a while . We 'll help each other get through this nightmare . It 's what Craig would have wanted .
CHIP: The whole night must be a total lur , right ?
NEEDY: That 's the thing , it 's not a blu at all ! I remember everything , in like ultra-high-def detail . The and , the fire , everything . Especially what happened after .
CHIP: `` After '' is the part I do n't really get , to be honest .
NEEDY: Please , I need someone to believe me . Jennifer was she was destroyed . She was dying in my hallway , Chip . I saw . I used my CPR training to check her pulse . And I felt her dying , on the inside , I mean . I 've known her so long that it 's like sometimes I can feel what she feels . We 're like E.T . and Elliot Ness .
CHIP: I believe you . Chip takes Needy 's hand and squeezes it .
NEEDY: Thanks , Chipper .
JONAS: You feel so warm . Why are you so warm ?
JENNIFER: ( firmly covering his
MOUTH: Shutties !
JONAS: Jennifer ! Jen
JENNIFER: What ?
JONAS: Look !
JENNIFER: Mm-hmm . They 're waiting .
JONAS: Uh , okay
JENNIFER: Do you miss Craig ?
JONAS: Of course .
JENNIFER: Do n't worry . You 're going to see your buddy again .
JONAS: You mean like in heaven someday ?
JENNIFER: No . She smiles and shakes her head .
MR. WROBLEWSKI: God , they 're feeling so much pain . Another scream , this time weaker .
NEEDY: Fried bologna is the bomb ! You want some , Greedo ?
RADIO DJ: That was Soft Shoulder , the local and who became the unlikely heroes of the tragedy in Devil 's Kettle last night . Eyewitnesses say the boys helped numerous people escape the inferno , risking their own lives in the process . That 's rock n ' roll with a conscience , ladies and gentlemen . Had a lot of requests for that one
MR. WROBLEWSKI: Virgin Mother !
NEEDY: Crap !
TONI: You said it .
NEEDY: Oh , hi , Mom . I did n't know you were awake .
TONI: I just had one of my night terrors .
NEEDY: It 's four o ' clock , so technically you had a day terror .
TONI: Right , right . I 'm all mixed up since I started working swing again .
NEEDY: What did you dream about ?
TONI: I dreamed some bad people were trying to nail me to a tree with hammers and big stakes and shit . Just like Jesus . She crosses herself piously .
NEEDY: Yes you are .
TONI: It 's like , do n't y'all touch my daughter . I 'll piss on you like Calvin .
NEEDY: You know , I can take care of myself , Mom .
TONI: That 's what you think . One of these days you 're gon na be crying out for me and I might not be there .
NEEDY: Hey Mom ? Did you get a chance to catch the news after you clocked out this morning ?
TONI: No . I just did my scratch tickets , snorted a few Lunesta and went straight to bed . Is something going on ?
NEEDY: Nothing . Forget it .
TONI: Do n't nothing happen in Devil 's Kettle .
NEEDY: Yes ma'am . Toni shakes her head and heads upstairs .
OFFICER WARZAK: We will get the man that did this to your son . You hear me ? We 'll get that sick M.F .
JONAS'S DAD: I 'll get him myself ! I will ! You hear me , you bastard ? I 'll cut off your nutsack and nail it to my door ! Like one of those lion doorknockers rich folks got ! That 'll be your balls !
NEEDY: Needy speaking .
JENNIFER: I feel sooo scrumptious !
NEEDY: Good for you .
JENNIFER: You know , like when you kiss a hot guy for the first time and you whole body feels like it 's on vibrate .
NEEDY: Yeah .
JENNIFER: It 's that good .
NEEDY: Lucky you . See , I 'm still kind of depressed about , you know , the giant smoldering funeral pyre in the middle of town ?
JENNIFER: Move-on dot org , Needy ! It 's over . Life 's too short to mope over some white-trash pig roast .
NEEDY: That 's really nice .
JENNIFER: I tell it like it is . Besides , you should be happy for me . I 'm having the best day since , like Jesus invented the calendar .
NEEDY: Jesus did n't invent the calendar .
JENNIFER: So blow it off .
NEEDY: It 'll just be a second .
JENNIFER: Pooh . I 'm crossing you out . She draws a mini-X in the air .
CHIP: I need to see you right now .
NEEDY: I can barely hear you .
CHIP: Camille is playing piano . Knock it off , Camille !
CAMILLE: You knock it off !
CHIP: Can you meet me at McCullum in ten ?
CAMILLE: You knock it off , Chip ! You 're penis cheese !
NEEDY: Fifteen . Back on JENNIFER
JENNIFER: What could possibly be more important than me and my godlike powers ?
NEEDY: I have to meet Chip at McCullum Park .
JENNIFER: Chip is looking cute to me lately . So tell me , is he packing some serious pubic inches ? What 's the story down there ?
NEEDY: I got ta go .
NEEDY: Why are the cops at your house ?
CHIP: They 're not . They 're at Jonas Kozelle 's house . He got murdered .
NEEDY: What ? ! Like , he was shot by gangbangers ?
CHIP: No , Needy ! Do you see anyone ollin ' on dubs around here ?
BEAT: Someone ripped Jonas limb from limb in the woods behind the school . Ate parts of him . They found teethmarks on him on the ody .
NEEDY: Some animals must 've got to him .
CHIP: Human teethmarks .
NEEDY: Who would do that ?
CHIP: I do n't know . It just happened after school . No one 's supposed to know yet , but my dad went ove there and talked to the cops . Jonas 's mom is catatonic . She 's just staring out the front window like a zombie mannequin robot statue .
NEEDY: This ca n't be a coincidence .
CHIP: What do you mean , Needy ?
NEEDY: A fiery death trap last night , and now a cannibal eats our starting tight-end ? Come on !
CHIP: Do n't get spooky on me , babe .
NEEDY: Seriously Chip . Most small towns only have something gruesome happen like , once every decade maybe . Devil 's Kettle gets two nightmares in 24 hours ? It 's freaktarded . It 's not right .
CHIP: What , do you think it 's , like supernatural ?
NEEDY: I do n't know . I 'm extremely intelligent but I obviously do n't know everything .
CHIP: Well , the bad luck 's got ta be ove now , right ? It ca n't get any worse , right ? Obviously it ca n't . It ca n't . I mean , you agree , ight ? There wo n't be anothe victim .
NEEDY: You 're shaking .
CHIP: I 'm cold . It 's very cold out here .
NEEDY: Want my sweater ?
CHIP: It 's pink .
NEEDY: Pink is cool . Rap guys wear pink .
MOURNERS: Through the trees , I will find you
MR. WROBLEWSKI: Before the period ends , I have an announcement .
JENNIFER: Bo-ring !
NEEDY: Are you okay ?
JENNIFER: No . I feel like boo-boo . My skin is breaking out . My hair is dull and lifeless . God , it 's like I 'm one of the normal girls ! Needy smooths her own hair self-consciously .
NEEDY: Are you PMS-ing or something ?
JENNIFER: PMS is n't real , Needy . It was invented by the boy-run media to make us seem crazy .
NEEDY: Oh .
MR. WROBLEWSKI: As I was saying , Needy and Jennifer , I finally have some good news to share with all of you . The members of the rock group Soft Shoulder have decided to extend a helping hand to our community .
NEEDY: What about the other 97 % ?
MR. WROBLEWSKI: Excuse me ?
NEEDY: The other 97 % . I mean , that 's just crass . Right ? She looks around for support , finding none .
CHASTITY: Soft Shoulder are American heroes .
NEEDY: No , they 're not . I was there , Chastity . They did n't actually help anyone escape the fire . I do n't even know how that rumor got started .
CHASTITY: Rumor ? ! RUMOR ? It 's true ! It 's on their Wikipedia page !
NEEDY: Oh , that 's crap
MR. WROBLEWSKI: GIRLS NEEDY They 've milked our pain our loss- - to get a stupid record deal ! No one would even know who they were if they had n't been playing here that night . They used us .
CHASTITY: ( growling , almost
POSSESSED: You take that back , Needy Lesnicki ! We need them now more then ever !
MR. WROBLEWSKI: That 's enough .
NEEDY: I 'm already sick of that song .
JENNIFER: Yeah . It 's poorly produced . Could the bass be any lower in the mix ?
NEEDY: No offense , but you look kind of drained . Is everything all right ?
JENNIFER: I 'm fine . It 's just , like , wearing off or something .
NEEDY: What 's wearing off ?
ALARMED: Are you on pot ?
JENNIFER: No , dick ridge ! Just forget I said anything .
COLIN: Hi . ( to Jennifer , more
NERVOUSLY: Hi , Jennifer .
JENNIFER: Oh , hey Colin . Listen , can I copy your bio lab again ? I never got around to dissecting that kitten fetus .
COLIN: Sure . Actually , I sort of wanted to ask you something .
JENNIFER: Oh . You want to know if I 'll go out with you .
COLIN: No ! Well yeah .
BEAT: How did you know ?
JENNIFER: Just go ahead with the pitch . Colin fidgets awkwardly .
COLIN: Well , we 've been having a lot of fun in class , you and I , and I just thought maybe we could go to a movie or something . There 's a midnight showing of Rocky Horro at the Bijou next weekend
JENNIFER: I do n't like boxing movies .
COLIN: It 's notfuck it . Never mind .
JENNIFER: Wait ! Colin turns around .
COLIN: Oh . Great ! Okay .
JENNIFER: I 'll text you my address . Colin walks away , grinning triumphantly .
NEEDY: That was random .
JENNIFER: I 'm used to guys asking me out .
NEEDY: Colin 's a really nice guy .
JENNIFER: He 's into maggot-rock . He wears nail polish .
CHIP: Hi .
JENNIFER: Hi Chip . Needy puts her arm around Chip protectively .
CHIP: Talking to your good pal Colin Gray again ?
NEEDY: No . He was just asking Jennife out on a date . Chip looks relieved .
CHIP: Can I come over tonight ?
NEEDY: Sure . I 'd like that .
CHIP: I went to Super Target and bought more condoms .
NEEDY: Thanks .
CHIP: Not that that has anything to do with my coming over .
NEEDY: I did n't assume that .
CHIP: Well , I 'll see you tonight . Needy waves as Chip walks away .
CHIP: For ambiance . It 's Jammin ' Jasmine .
NEEDY: Mmm .
CHIP: My mom has Holiday Scents too , if you 're interested .
NEEDY: No , this is nice .
COLIN: Yo ?
NEEDY: `` Sensual Swirl ? ''
CHIP: It 's supposed to make it feel good for the girl .
NEEDY: Oh . Cool .
JENNIFER: You made it .
COLIN: What 's going on ? This is n't really your house , is it ?
JENNIFER: No baby . This is our house , just for you and me . We can play Mommy and Daddy . Colin is totally dumbstruck .
COLIN: Do you even know my last name ?
JENNIFER: Silly . I 've been sending you signals all year . Could n't you tell ? You give me such a wettie .
NEEDY: Oh . It 's got little bumps on it . I can hardly wait .
COLIN: Jennifer
JENNIFER: You scared ? I thought boys like you were into vermin .
COLIN: No way
JENNIFER: Oh , do n't you dare pass out ! I need you to be conscious .
COLIN: I got ta go
JENNIFER: I need you frightened .
NEEDY: Hopeless..hopeless CHIP opens his eyes .
CHIP: What ? Am I hurting you ? Needy starts weeping .
CHIP: Is it something I did ?
NEEDY: It 's her .
CHIP: Do you need more foreplay ?
NEEDY: I have to go . I 'm sorry . I just feel like somethingsomething terrible
CHIP: You feel What does that even mean ? I 'm worried about you .
NEEDY: I 'm so sorry , Chip . I 'm so sorry . Everything is just wrong .

NEEDY: Mommy ! Mommy ? Please be home !
LITTLE JENNIFER: I 'll be Perfect Prom Barbie and you be her .
LITTLE NEEDY: Why do I have to be Ugly Ashley ?
LITTLE JENNIFER: You can be Ugly Ashley or Ken . Choose .
LITTLE NEEDY: What 's wrong , Jennifer ?
LITTLE JENNIFER: OWWWWWW ! Damn ! Ass !
LITTLE NEEDY: Better . We should get a Band-Aid though .
LITTLE JENNIFER: We 're sisters now , you know .
NEEDY: I never tell on you .
JENNIFER'S VOICE: What 's up , Monistat ?
JENNIFER: God , enough screaming already . You 're such a cliche .
NEEDY: Get out !
JENNIFER: But we always share your bed when we have slumber parties . She winks conspiratorially at Needy .
NEEDY: What the fuck is happening ?
JENNIFER: Whoa . I have never heard you drop the F-bomb before . What 's buggin ' ?
NEEDY: I saw you ! I saw you ! The cartheI
JENNIFER: Buh-buh-buh . Slow down , tardy slip . You sound like a sped .
NEEDY: I 'm calling the police .
JENNIFER: Go ahead , narc me out . I 've got the cops in my back pocket . I 'm fucking a cadet , remember ?
NEEDY: What do you want ?
JENNIFER: I want to explain some things to you . You 've already seen too much and besides best friends do n't keep secrets . Right ? Needy nods , terrified .
NEEDY: Yeah , it rings a bell .
JENNIFER: Well , I got pretty messed up . I almost died . You know those guys in Soft Shoulder ? Totally evil . They 're basically agents of Satan with awesome haircuts . I figured that out as soon as I got into their molester van .
NIKOLAI: Shut your mouth , object .
DIRK: Nikolai
JENNIFER: Are you guys rapists ? !
NIKOLAI: You wish .
MICK: Hey guys ? Do we even know if she 's a virgin ?
JENNIFER: Yesyes ! Of course I 'm a virgin ! I 've never done sex ever . I do n't even know how . So maybe you should find some other girl who does . Know how .
NIKOLAI: Told you , Dirk . You owe me a beer .
DIRK: Sure , man .
NEEDY: What did they do to you ?
JENNIFER: Just let me finish . So they drove all the way out to the falls . I tried to figure out an escape , but it was so dark out there
NIKOLAI: We got a waxing moon . Perfection .
MICK: You 're the man , Wolf .
DIRK: I do n't know if we should go through with this .
NIKOLAI: Do you want to be rich and famous like the guy from Maroon 5 ? Or do you want to be a huge suicidal loser ?
DIRK: Maroon 5 .
NIKOLAI: Then grow a pair and fetch me the itual ! God .
MICK: That 's it ?
NIKOLAI: What ? I found it on Google .
JENNIFER: My name is Jennifer .
NIKOLAI: That 's fascinating .
JENNIFER: Please let me go . I 'll do anything . Anything you want .
NIKOLAI: I only hump nines and tens . You 're a seven at best , even with the chicken cutlets .
JENNIFER: Maybe you could just hire a publicist . Make some T-shirts o something . Hey , I could be on you street team !
NIKOLAI: Sorry , darling .
JENNIFER: Please
NIKOLAI: Start chanting , boys .
DIRK: Dude , that is a hot murder weapon !
NIKOLAI: It 's a bowie knife .
DIRK: Bowie . Nice .
NIKOLAI: `` There 's a starman waiting in the sky ''
BAND: `` He 'd really like to meet us , but he thinks he 'd blow our minds ''
JENNIFER: Being tortured would make most girls black out or something . But I 'm so hard core , I was with them the whole time . I could feel them gutting me Under my ribs , up into my belly , then right through my heart .
NEEDY: Theykilled you .
JENNIFER: I 'm here , are n't I ? She shakes her head , annoyed with Needy .
NEEDY: Maybe it did .
JENNIFER: Whatever . Anyway , I do n't really emember what happened after that . I just woke up a few hours late and found my way back , somehow .
NEEDY: I remember .
JENNIFER: I could n't bring myself to hurt you . I mean , I 'm a really good friend . But I felt so hungry . I had to do something .
JENNIFER: Ever since then , I just somehow knew what I needed to do to be strong . And when I 'm fulllike I am right nowI 'm like , immortal ! I can do stuff like this .
NEEDY: What do you mean , `` when you 're full '' ?
JENNIFER: You know . Full . Like full of tasty morsels . Needy shakes her head , not comprehending .
NEEDY: What about my mom 's Kia ? Why did you attack me out there ? Why were you covered in blood ? You did n't even look human . Jennifer rolls her eyes .
JENNIFER: You should talk to someone about these disturbing thoughts you 're having . We 're all concerned . Especially Chip . I think he 's having second thoughts about you .
NEEDY: Leave !
JENNIFER: My , are n't we a C-U-Next-Tuesday ?
NEEDY: GET OUT ! JENNIFER Come on . Let me stay the night . We can play `` boyfriend/girlfriend '' like we used to . She smiles seductively .
JENNIFER: You said to leave . So I 'm outtie-
PRIEST: We gather here today to celebrate the life of Colin Gray , who was plucked from the prime of
MR. GRAY: These are Colin 's friends .
GOTH BOY: Colin ! Take me with you ! I belong down there ! In the DAAAARKNESS !
GOTH GIRL: No , Kevin . Those are just his fleshly remains . He 's among the dark angels of the realm now . Fly , Colin . Fly into the firmament .
GOTH BOY: Is it cool if we camp here for a few days ? We want to commune with his corpse . He was our spooky homeboy .
PRIEST: Children , this is a private service for family only .
GOTH GIRL: Oh , right . I need to ask you something , Mrs. Gray . It 's really important for me to have closure .
PRIEST: Young lady , have some respect fo this family
MRS. GRAY: No . It 's fine .
GOTH GIRL: Is it true that Colin had a date with Jennifer Check the night he was killed ?
MR. GRAY: Did he ?
GOTH GIRL: Have a date with Jennifer Check . Colin 's parents stare at the ground .
GOTH BOY: Um , Chloe ? Maybe you should be mad at the person who murdered Colin . All Jennifer Check did was invite him over to watch Aquamarine .
GOTH GIRL: That 's WORSE !
GOTH BOY: Colin would n't have liked this .
MRS. GRAY: Oh , you think so , Powder ? Yeah , you 're right ! I 'm pretty sure my son would n't have liked being eaten by a fucking CANNIBAL and uried before his eighteenth irthday ! Wow , you must have known him so well !
MR. GRAY: Jill
MRS. GRAY: By the time they found Colin in that godforsaken house , he looked like lasagna with teeth . I 'd know I had to identify the remains . My oy 's not in the realm of the undead . He 's not flying around in the firmament with magical wings of flame . He 's in an overpriced osewood box that 's headed six feet downtown . She kicks the coffin to illustrate .
CHIP: Hey . Did you buy Turnabout tickets yet ? I do n't get paid until next week .
NEEDY: I got ta show you something .
CHIP: What is it ?
NEEDY: Not here . Behind the school .

NEEDY: Yes , but I promise you this is the last thing I need to show y
CHIP: Needy , I care about you . A lot . As a person , not just a girl I made love to for four minutes the othe night . And I 'm scared of what 's happening to you . You 're acting eally fucked up .
NEEDY: Please just let me show you .
CHIP: Demondemonic
NEEDY: Demonic transference . It 's something that happens when you try to sacrifice a virgin to Satan without using an actual virgin ! CHIP stares at her .
READING: `` If the human sacrifice is impure , the result may still be attained , ut a demon will forever reside the soul of the victim . She must forever feed on flesh to sustain the demon . '' See ? CHIP looks more dubious than ever .
CHIP: Uh-huh .
NEEDY: She 's eating boys ! They make he strong . Really strong . And when she 's hungry , she gets weak and cranky and her hair is all full of split ends . And look at this She holds up one of the printouts .
CHIP: Youyou really think Jennife killed Jonas and Colin ?
NEEDY: And possibly Ahmet from India .
CHIP: Really ? You think she ate those guys ?
NEEDY: No . No ! Of course not !
CHIP: Is that what you think ?
NEEDY: NoListen , I 'll make an appointment with Mr. Feely . I 'm eal sorry about this sudden onset of teenage paranoia .
ROBOTIC: My hormones and emotions are aswirl , and my moods are erratic
CHIP: It 's all right , Needy .
NEEDY: This has been a crummy school year , Chip .
CHIP: No shit .
NEEDY: Listen , I 'm done with all that devil stuff . Do you know what you 're wearing to Turnabout ?
CHIP: I was thinking a suit with black shoes and a boutonniere , right here .
CHIP: What color dress are you gon na wear ? I need to order your wrist corsage .
NEEDY: I do n't know yet .
CHIP: How about magenta ? You 're definitely a winter . My mom says winters should wear regal jewel tones like magenta . Or possibly teal .
NEEDY: Oh yeah , your mom 's an Avon lady .
CHIP: Well , they call them `` sales reps '' now .
NEEDY: Right . Well , I 'll try to find something magenta .
CHIP: That 'll look dope .
TONI: You look beautiful .
NEEDY: I look pork stupid .
TONI: No , you 've got that tiny waist , like a fashion model . I always thought you looked like Cindy Crawford . She gently takes off Needy 's glasses .
NEEDY: Who 's Cindy Crawford ?

CHIP'S MOM: I need to give you something .
CHIP: Hang on . Chip puts on a robe and opens the door .
CHIP'S MOM: I 've been thinking about it for a while , and I think you need to be carrying this . There 's obviously a sicko out there who likes boys . Boys your age . And I do n't want you going out there unarmed .
CHIP: I can take care of myself . I 've een using the Bowflex .
CHIP'S MOM: Did you hear what Colin Gray looked like when they found him ?

MR. WROBLEWSKI: Can I have everyone 's attention please ?
JENNIFER: CHIP !
CHIP: You were n't calling my name .
JENNIFER: Yes , I was .
CHIP: I could n't hear it .
JENNIFER: I think you were maybe spacing out . You were like this Derrrrr . She mimics a blank , drooling expression .
CHIP: I was ?
JENNIFER: Yes , exactly like that . Listen , I need to talk to you about you-know- who . Our little Needy .
CHIP: I know .
JENNIFER: Are you worried ? ` Cause I 'm super- stressed about her . God knows how I even sleep at night .
CHIP: She has n't been the same fo weeks .
JENNIFER: I think I know what 's wrong with her . In fact , I know I know what 's wrong with her .
CHIP: Then tell me .
JENNIFER: I feel bad telling you this .
SIGHING: Okay , you know Needy 's been a total Lithium candidate since the night Colin Gray died . But that 's not just because he was brutally murdered and stuff . It 's ecause.I do n't wan na say this .
CHIP: Say it !
JENNIFER: Needy and Colin were intimate . By that I mean he was poking he donut on a semi-regular basis .
CHIP: Needy 's not like that .
JENNIFER: That 's what she wants you to elieve . But trust me , her and Colin were doing stuff you have n't even heard of . Total varsity moves .
CHIP: But you were with Colin the night he was killed .
JENNIFER: Well , apparently he had a thing for me no surprise there . And I figured Needy was busy jumping your jock that night , so I agreed to a little pity date . Colin ought me to that empty house so we could have some privacy . But he wanted to go too far , so I left after a few minutes . Next thing I knew , they 'd found She sniffles , wiping her eye .
CHIP: Eye-talian .
JENNIFER: Huh ?
CHIP: Never mind .
JENNIFER: I 'm sorry you had to hear this from me . I 'm just so worried about Needy . She 's losing her shit . Colin was her everything .
CHIP: I just ca n't believe this .
JENNIFER: Well , you 've been talking to he more than I have . How bad is it ?
CHIP: It 's bad , man . It 's bad .
JENNIFER: I can only imagine the paranoid theories she 's come up with .
CHIP: Oh , you have no idea .
JENNIFER: I just ca n't believe she would do this to you . I care so much about you , Chip .
MR. WROBLEWSKI: Boys and girls , please welcomeSoft Shoulder !
NIKOLAI: Good evening , babies . Are you eady for some bad vibrations ?
NEEDY: Chip !

JENNIFER: We really should n't be doing this .
CHIP: You 're better than Needy . Jennifer smiles , satisfied .
JENNIFER: Natch . She resumes kissing him enthusiastically .
CHIP: This feels weird . Can we go somewhere else ?
JENNIFER: I have just the place .
CHIP: Murphy Pool ? I do n't think we can go in there . I knew some skate guys who went in there . They got in big trouble and now they have to pick up garbage for 100 hours . Jennifer giggles and pulls him along .
JENNIFER: You 're in big trouble anyway . Come on .
NEEDY: Well , hi there Camille ! Is Chippe home ?
CHIP'S MOM: Needy ? Is something wrong ?
NEEDY: Where 's Chip ?
CHIP'S MOM: He left for the dance at least twenty minutes ago . He certainly should have been there by now .
NEEDY: He walked ? Mrs. Dove , you mean to only tell me that in these dangerous , godless times you let your only son walk alone at night ?
CHIP'S MOM: Well , it 's only five blocks . My God , your hair is
NEEDY: Which way did he go ?
CHIP'S MOM: He usually cuts across the park . She turns to scold Camille .
CHIP: Are n't you cold ?
JENNIFER: Never , Trevor . I 'm hot like magma .
CHIP: What are you doing ?
JENNIFER: Swimming .
CHIP: Ha ha .
JENNIFER: Come on in , Chip . Show me you east stroke .
CHIP: The water looks disgusting .
JENNIFER: It 's not so bad .
CHIP: Are you kidding ? It 's totally ubonic in there . I think I see a dead possum with a Doritos bag in its pouch . And that looks like a used syringe over there He slaps away a FLY .
JENNIFER: I 'm sorry . I was just trying to make you laugh . I think now , more than ever , we need laughter . We 've oth lost a close friend . CHIP nods sadly .
CHIP: I know .
JENNIFER: I feel so empty .
CHIP: Me too .

JENNIFER: God , do you have to undermine everything I do ? You 're such a player-hater .
NEEDY: You 're a jerk .
JENNIFER: Nice insult , Lizzie McGuire . Got any more harsh digs ?
NEEDY: You know what ? You were never a good friend . Ever . Even when we were little . You used to steal my toys and pour lemonade on my bed and make me be Ugly Ashley when we played Barbies !
JENNIFER: And now I 'm eating your boyfriend ! See ? At least I 'm consistent .
NEEDY: Why do you need him ? Huh ? She begins to weep .
SOBBING: Why do you need the one guy who 's ever liked me ? You can have anyone , Jennifer !
JENNIFER: I am not insecure . God , what a joke ! How could I be insecure ? I was the Snowflake Queen !
NEEDY: Yeah , two years ago . When you were socially relevant .
NEEDY: You were skinny then , too !
JENNIFER: I 'm gon na eat your soul and shit it out , Lesnicki .
NEEDY: I thought you only murdered boys .
JENNIFER: I go both ways .
NEEDY: We hurt you
JENNIFER: Got a tampon ? Needy shakes her head mutely .
NEEDY: Where are you going ?
JENNIFER: Fuck this noise . I 'm out . You losers are more trouble then you 're worth . She continues climbing .
NEEDY: Why give up now ? He 's almost dead ! Get your bulimic ass back here and kill us both !
JENNIFER: Nah . I mean , you say I 've been a ad friend all these years . I might as well throw you a bone .
NEEDY: Oh , Chip !
CHIP: Needy . You saved me .
NEEDY: I 'm gon na call for help .
CHIP: Oh no , I 'm out of minutes !
NEEDY: I think 911 is always a free call .
CHIP: Oh yeah . You 're right .
NEEDY: It 's not working . It 's full of Jennifer-goo .
CHIP: Hey , I 'm going somewhere
NEEDY: No ! You 're not going anywhere !

NEEDY: I love you .
CHIP: Yeah me too . And you look hot in that dress .
NEEDY: You 're clearly delirious .
CHIP: No . When you 're dying , you can see everything a lot clearer . You can see what 's true and what 's not . The things that are true have this glowing halo of light around them , like a picture of the Baby Jesus , or Barbara Walters when they use the special lens . And I know fo sure that you 're totally hot .
NEEDY: I 'm never leaving .
CHIP: But I have to go .
NEEDY: No !

JERRY: It 's a quality that might come in handy for a commercial sometime .
TIDWELL: You are not allowed to act this way .
JERRY: Why not ?
TIDWELL: Man , I got a shelf life of ten years , tops ! My next contract 's got ta bring me the dollars that'11 last me and mine a very long time . I 'm out of this sport in five years .

WILBURN: Your timing is impeccable , Maguire . Gee , I ca n't imagine how you ever lost Cush
JERRY: I started talking with Dennis Wilburn about your renegotation .
TIDWELL: Did you tell him about the `` ten million for four years ? ''
JERRY: Uh , not today , but
TIDWELL: John Taylor . J.J. Stokes . Andre Rison . I SMOKE all these fools , and yet they 're making the big sweet dollars . They 're making the money , and I got an agent that ai n't even put the number on the table .
JERRY: I understand your anxiety .
TIDWELL: Maybe you do n't . Because it 's not just the money I deserve . It 's not just the `` coin . '' It 's the
JERRY: That 's your word ?

TIDWELL: You 're telling me to dance .
JERRY: No , I 'm saying to be
TIDWELL: `` Love me love me love me put me on t.v . '' That 's the iconography of rascism , man !
JERRY: Rod , I 'm not a rascist . I 'm telling you to be the best version of you , to get back to the guy who first started playing this game . Way back when you were a kid . It was n't just about the money , was it ?
TIDWELL: Do your job , man , do n't tell me to dance .
JERRY: Fine .
TIDWELL: I 'm an athlete , not an entertainer . These are the ABC 's of ME . Get it ? I do n't dance .
JERRY: Forget it . Forget it .
TIDWELL: No tell me .
JERRY: I 'm out here for you ! You do n't know what it 's like to be me out here for you . It is an up-at-dawn pride-swallowing seige that I will never fully tell you about ! Okay ? ! Help me help you help me help you .
TIDWELL: You 're hanging by a very thin thread , dude . And I dig that about you .
JERRY: Hey . I 'm happy to entertain you ! I 'll see you in L.A. !

JERRY: Happy . He said `` happy ? ''
DOROTHY: Actually he said `` glad . ''
JERRY: Good . Good . Glad is good .
DOROTHY: Plus , you could use that commission .
JERRY: I sunk most of what I had into this condo , which devalued , and
DOROTHY: You do n't have to explain .
JERRY: Look , the other night , I want to apologize .
DOROTHY: Yeah , what happened there .
JERRY: We 're two people working togethe and we ca n't have an atmosphere .
DOROTHY: I 'm relieved you said that .
JERRY: I mean , the other night was I felt like you understood something I could barely even say , something way down deep in the murk but we have a company here to think about . I wo n't ever take advantage of you in that way again .
DOROTHY: Oh good .
JERRY: You walked out on a job for me , and I wo n't ruin that .
DOROTHY: Exactly because I know this is a time when you need to be alone with your thoughts .
JERRY: You want to go out to dinner ?
JAN: I broke up with the Cowboy . And now he 's stalking me
ALICE: What 's the current definition of stalking ?
JAN: So Romeo under the trellis was a stalker .
DOROTHY: Hey , looks like you 've got a fan .

LAUREL: Hey !
DOROTHY: That 's the first time I ever saw him kiss a man , like a dad , was n't that just thrilling ? I mean , he must have been needing that .
LAUREL: No no . Do n't cry at the beginning of the date .
DOROTHY: Oh , knock it off !
LAUREL: And do n't be a shoulder for him to cry on either .
JERRY: It was laziness1 my whole breakup with Avery . You know that thing you say , `` it 's nobody 's fault . '' It 's one of the great lies , right ? Someone is always to blame if you go for it , go for it like you do a job , work at it
DOROTHY: Maybe love should n't be such hard work . I know , but
HEAD MARIACHI: A song for the lovers ?
DOROTHY: We work together .
JERRY: See , you choose . If you fall fo someone , if you make a commitment , you should make it work . It 's only when `` options '' entered the picture that things got bad . I 'm speaking historically now . It 's a modern day concept , nueroticism how do I feeeeeel ? I think the only good thing to
DOROTHY: Maybe you should call her .
JERRY: No no no . I just underestimated her her temper , I guess . Why are we even talking about this ?
FLOWER GIRL: A rose for the lady .

CHAD: Yeah , how 'd it go with Sportboy ?
DOROTHY: Still going .
CHAD: Treat her right , man . She 's
JERRY: Yeah well
CHAD: She 's great . And I know this is a little awkward , but I want you to use this .
DOROTHY: What is this MUSIC ?
LAUREL: First you got ta tell me something .
DOROTHY: No
LAUREL: Because I 'm worried that you 're putting your faith in this guy who , because of the way things are going , may not have an emotional marble in his head .
DOROTHY: Please , if I start talking
LAUREL: Guys are just different people when they 're hanging onto the ottom rung .
DOROTHY: so what am I , for taking the opportunity , Laurel ?
LAUREL: Easy , hon , I was just looking fo fun details
DOROTHY: Oh , well , why did n't you say so ? And oh , I do n't know if you 're interested in this detail , but I was just about to tell you that I love him . I love him , and I do n't care what you think . I love him for the guy he wants to be , and I love him for the guy he almost is . I love him .
RAY: Hi Jerry !
DOROTHY: Oh God .

MICHEL DOLLÉ: Oui , je veux bien . Je vais leur écrire .
VOICE: January , 1961 - President Dwight D. Eisenhower 's Farewell Address to the Nation -
EISENHOWER: The conjunction of an immense military establishment and a large arms industry is new in the American experience . The total influence - economic , political , even spiritual - is felt in every city , every statehouse , every office of the Federal Government In the councils of government we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence , whether sought or unsought , y the military industrial complex . The potential for the disastrous ise of misplaced power exists and will persist We must never let the weight of this combination endanger our liberties or democratic processes . We should take nothing for granted
VOICE 2: November , 1960 - Senator John F. Kennedy of Massachusetts wins one of the narrowest election victories in American history over the Vice- President Richard Nixon by a little more than 100,000 votes . Rumors abound that he stole the election in Illinois through the Democratic political machine of Mayor Daley At his inauguration , at a time when American males all wore hats , he let his hair blow free in the wind . Alongside his beautiful and elegant wife of French origin , Jacqueline Bouvier , J.F.K . is the symbol of the new freedom of the 1960 's , signifying change and upheaval to the American public , scaring many and hated passionately by some . To win the election and to appease their fears , Kennedy at first takes a tough Cold War stance .
VOICE 3: He inherits a secret war against the Communist Castro dictatorship in Cuba , a war run by the CIA and angry Cuban exiles out of bases in the Southern United States , Panama , Nicaragua and Guatemala . Castro is a successful revolutionary frightening to American business interests in Latin America - companies like Cabot 's United Fruit , Continental Can , and Rockefeller 's Standard Oil . This war culminates in the disastrous Bay of Pigs invasion in April 1961 , when Kennedy refuses to provide air cove for the exile brigade . Of the 1600 men who invade , 114 are killed , 1200 are captured . The Cuban exiles and the CIA are furious at Kennedy 's irresolution Kennedy , taking public esponsibility for the failure , privately claims the CIA lied to him and tried to manipulate him into ordering an all-out American invasion of Cuba . He vows to splinter the CIA into a thousand pieces and fires Director Allen Dulles , Deputies Charles Cabell and Richard Bissell , the top leadership of the Agency .
VOICE 4: The CIA , however , continues it 's secret war on Castro with dozens of sabotage and assassination attempts under it 's ZR/RIFLE and MONGOOSE programs - The Agency collaborates with organized crime elements such as John Roselli , Sam Giancana , and Santos Trafficante of Tampa , whose casino operations in Cuba , worth more than a hundred million dollars a year in income , Castro has shut down .
VOICE 5: In October 1962 , the world comes to the brink of nuclear war when Kennedy quarantines Cuba after announcing the presence of offensive Soviet nuclear missiles 90 miles off American shores . The Joint Chiefs of Staff and the CIA call for an invasion . Kennedy refuses . Soviet ships with more missiles sail towards the island , ut at the last moment turn back . The world breathes with relief but ackstage in Washington , rumors abound that J.F.K . has cut a secret deal with Russian Premier Khrushchev not to invade Cuba in return for a Russian withdrawal of missiles . Suspicions abound that Kennedy is `` soft on Communism . ''
VOICE 6: In the ensuing months , Kennedy clamps down on Cuban exile activities , closing training camps , restricting covert operations , prohibiting shipment of weapons out of the country . The covert arm of the CIA nevertheless continues its plan to assassinate Castor In March '63 , Kennedy announces drastic cuts in the defense budget . In Novembe 1963 , he orders the withdrawal by Christmas of the first 1000 troops of the 16,000 stationed in Vietnam . He tells several of his intimates that he will withdraw all Vietnam troops after the '64 election , saying to the Assistant Secretary of State , Roger Hilsman , `` The Bay of Pigs has taught me one , not to trust generals or the CIA , and two , that if the American people do not want to use American troops to remove a Communist egime 90 miles from our coast , how can I ask them to use troops to remove a Communist regime 9,000 miles away ? '' Finally , in August 1963 , over the objections of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , the United States , Great Britain and the Soviet Union sign a treaty banning nuclear bom tests in the atmosphere , underwate and in space Early that fateful summer , Kennedy speaks of his new vision at American University in Washington .
JFK: What kind of peace do we seek ? Not a pax Americana enforced on the world y American weapons of war We must re-examine our own attitudes towards the Soviet Union If we can not now end our differences at least we can help make the world safe for diversity . For , in the final analysis , our most basic link is that we all inhabit this small planet . We all breathe the same air . We all cherish our children 's future . And we are all mortal
ROSE: They 're going up to Dallas to whack Kennedy . Friday the 22nd , that 's when they 're going to do it . In Dealey Plaza . They 're gon na whack him ! You got ta call somebody , these are serious fuckin ' guys .
DOCTOR: Higher ' n a kite on something . Been like this since she came in .
VOICE 7: More rumors emerge of J.F.K . 's ackdoor efforts outside usual State Department and CIA channels to establish dialogue with Fidel Castro through contacts at the United Nations in New York . Kennedy is seeking change on all fronts . Bitter battles are fought with Southern segregationists to get James Meredith into the University of Mississippi . Three months after Kennedy submits a sweeping civil rights bill to Congress , Martin Luther King leads 250,000 in a march on Washington . Robert Kennedy , as Attorney General , for the first time ever vigorously prosecutes the Mafia in American life , bringing and winning a record number of cases - 288 convictions of organized crime figures including 13 grand juries against Jimmy Hoffa and his Teamsters Union . The President also takes on Big Business , forcing ack steel prices , winning 45 of 46 antitrust cases during 1963 and he wants to help everyday taxpayers by ending age- old business privileges like the oil depletion allowance and the fees paid to the Federal Reserve Bank for printing America 's currency . Revolutionary changes are foreseen after J.F.K . 's assumed re-election in 1964 . Foremost in the political consciousness of the country is the possibility of a Kennedy dynasty . Robert Kennedy in '68 , Teddy Kennedy in '76 . In November , 1963 John Kennedy travels to Texas , his popularity sagging to 59 % largely due to his civil rights stand fo which he is particularly hated in the South . Texas is a crucial state for him to carry in '64 . With him is Vice-President , Lyndon Johnson and Texas Governor John Connally . On November 21 , they visit Houston and San Antonio . On the morning of November 22 , he speaks in Fort Worth , then flies 15 minutes to Love Field in Dallas , where he takes a motorcade through downtown Dallas on his way to speak at 12 30 at the International Trade Mart . Later , the motorcade takes him through Dealey Plaza at
AMBULANCE VOICE: We are en route to Parkland .
VOICE: We 'll be there in about five minutes .
JACKIE KENNEDY: And in the motorcade , you know I usually would be waving mostly to the left side and he was waving mostly to the right , which is one reason you 're not looking at each othe very much . And it was terribly hot . Just blinding all of us We could see a tunnel in front of us . Everything was really slow then . And I remember thinking it would be so cool under that tunnel .
CBS BULLETIN: We interrupt this program to bring you this flash bulletin . A burst of gunfire ! Three bursts of gunfire , apparently from automatic weapons , were fired at President Kennedy 's motorcade in downtown Dallas .
JIM: What 's wrong , Lou ?
LOU: Boss , the President 's been shot . In Dallas . Five minutes ago .
JIM: Oh no ! How bad ?
LOU: No word yet . But they think it 's in the head . Jim gets up , heading rapidly for the door .
JIM: Come on . Napoleon 's has a TV set .
NEWSMAN 1: Apparently three bullets were found . Governor Connally also appeared to e hit . The President was rushed by the Secret Service to Parkland Memorial Hospital four miles from Dealey Plaza .
JIM: There 's still a chance , dammit ! Come on , Jack - pull through .
MANAGER: I do n't believe it . I do n't believe it . Here , in this country .
WALTER CRONKITE: From Dallas , Texas - the flash apparently official , President Kennedy died at 1 p.m. Central Standard Time , 2 o'clock Eastern Standard Time , some 38 minutes ago . Vice-President Johnson has left the hospital in Dallas , but we do not know to where he has proceeded . Presumably , he will be taking the oath of office shortly , and become the 36th President of the United States .
JIM: I did n't always agree with him - too liberal for my tastes - but I espected him . He had style God , I 'm ashamed to be an American today .
NEWSMAN 2: Many arrests have been made here today . Anyone looking even remotely suspicious is being detained . Most of the crowd has gone home but there are still many stunned people wandering around in Dealey Plaza unable to comprehend what happened here earlier today .
BLACK WOMAN: It 's all so terrible . I jes ' ca n't stop crying . He did so much fo this country , for colored people . Why ?
MAN: I grabbed my kids and wife and hit the ground . The bullets were coming over our heads - from that fence ack on the knoll - I was just so shaken . I saw his face when it hit he just , his ear flew off , he turned just real white and then went stiff like a board and flopped over on his stomach , with his foot sticking out .
WOMAN 2: I thought it came from up there , that building . CUT TO the Book Depository .
MAN 2: I heard shots from over there . CUT TO the County Records Building .
NEWSMAN 2: How many shots ?
WOMAN 3: About 3 to 4 I do n't know .
MAN 3: I never thought it could happen in America .
BANISTER: All this blubbering over that sonofabitch ! They 're grieving like they knew the man . It makes me want to puke .
MARTIN: God 's sake , chief . The President was shot .
BANISTER: A bullshit President ! I do n't see any weeping for all the thousands of Cubans that bastard condemned to death and torture at the Bay of Pigs . Where are all the tears for the Russians and Hungarians and Chinese living like slaves in prison camps un by Kennedy 's communist buddies - All these damned peace treaties ! I 'm telling ya Jack , that 's what happens when you let the niggers vote . They get together with the Jews and the Catholics and elect an Irish bleeding heart .
MARTIN: Chief , maybe you had a little too much to drink .
BANISTER: Bullshit ! Bartender , another round Here 's to the New Frontier . Camelot in smithereens . I 'll drink to that .
NEWSMAN 3: This is the rifle , it is a Mannlicher - Carcano Italian rifle , a powerful World War II military gun used by infantry and highly accurate at distances of 100 yards .
NEWSMAN 4: A flash bulletin the Dallas Police have just announced they have a suspect in the killing of a Dallas police officer , J.D . Tippit , who was shot at 1 15 in Oak Cliff , a subu of Dallas .
TV OSWALD: No , I do n't know what I 'm charged with I do n't know what dispatches you people have been given , but I emphatically deny these charges .
LOU: One little guy with a cheap rifle - look what he can do .
JIM: Let 's get outta here , Lou . I saw too much stuff like this in the war .
BANISTER: Well , the kid musta gone nuts , right ? I said Oswald must 've flipped . Just did this crazy thing before anyone could stop him , right ?
MARTIN: I think I 'll cut out here , chief . I got ta get home .
BANISTER: Get home my ass . We 're going to the office , have another drink . I want some company tonight .
MARTIN: Chief , sometimes I do n't know whethe you 're kidding or not .
BANISTER: I could n't be more serious , Jack . Those big red eyes have me wondering about your loyalty .
MARTIN: You may not like this , chief , but you 're beginning to act paranoid . I mean , you really are .
BANISTER: You found out about Dave Ferrie going to Texas today and you went through all my files to see what was going on . You 're a goddamn spy .
MARTIN: Goddammit chief , why would I eve need to look in your files ? I saw enough here this summer to write a ook .
BANISTER: I always lock my files . And you were the only one here today What do you mean , you son of a bitch ?
MARTIN: You know what I mean . I saw a lot of strange things going on in this office this summer . And a lotta strange people .
BANISTER: You did n't see a goddamn thing , you little weasel . Do you get it ? You did n't see a goddamn thing .
NEWSMAN 5: Did you shoot the President ?
TV OSWALD: I did n't shoot anybody , no sir . I 'm just a patsy .
LIZ: My god , he sure looks like a creep . What 's he talkin ' 'bout a patsy ?
TV OSWALD: Well , I was questioned by a judge . However , I protested at the time that I was not allowed legal epresentation during that very short and sweet hearing . Uh , I really do n't know what the situation is about . Nobody has told me anything except that I am accused of , uh , murdering a policeman . I know nothing more than that and I do request that someone come forward to give me , uh , legal assistance .
NEWSMAN 5: Did you kill the President ?
TV OSWALD: No . I have not been charged with that . In fact nobody has said that to me yet . The first thing I heard about it was when the newspape eporters in the hall , uh , asked me that question .
NEWSMAN 6: You have been charged .
TV OSWALD: Sir ?
NEWSMAN 6: You have been charged . Oswald seems shocked .
NEWSMAN 5: Were you ever in the Free Cuba Movement or whatever the
RUBY: It was the Fair Play for Cuba Committee .
NEWSMAN 6: What did you do in Russia ? What happened to your eye ?
TV OSWALD: A policeman hit me .
GARRISON: He seems pretty cool to me for a man under pressure like that .
LIZ: Icy , you mean . He gives me the willies come on sugarplums , it 's past your bedtimes Come on , let 's go upstairs . Mattie - get ahold of yourself .
MATTIE: Why , Mr. Jim ? He was a great man , Mr. Jim , a great man Jim is moved by her .
TV WADE: There is no one else but him . He has been charged in the Supreme Court with murder with malice . We 're gon na ask for the death penalty .
FRANK: So several hours after the assassination , a disturbed portrait is emerging of Lee Harvey Oswald . Described as shy and introverted , he spent much of his childhood in New Orleans , Louisiana and went to high school there . After a stint in the Marines , he apparently became fascinated by Communism and in 1959 defected to the Soviet Union .
BOB: He married a Russian woman there , Frank , had a child , and then returned to the United States after 30 months . But he is still believed to be a dedicated Marxist and a fanatical supporter of Fidel Castro and ultra left wing causes . He spent last summer in New Orleans and was arrested in a brawl with anti-Castro Cuban exiles .
FRANK: And apparently , Bob , Oswald had been passing out pro-Castro pamphlets fo an organization called Fair Play fo Cuba , a Communist front he reportedly elongs to .
BOB: And we have Marina Oswald , his Russian- orn wife , who has identified the ifle found in the Book Depository as belonging to her husband . And we have
JIM: Lou , I 'm sorry to disturb you this late yeah , matter of routine but we better get on this New Orleans connection of Oswald 's right away . Check out his record , find any friends or associates from last summer . Let 's meet with the senior assistants and investigators day after tomorrow , Sunday , yeah , at 11 Thanks Lou .
MARINA OSWALD: Lee good man he not shoot anyone .
LOU: As far as Oswald 's associates , boss , the one name that keeps popping up is David Ferrie .
JIM: I know David - a strange character .
LOU: He 's been in trouble before . Used to be a hot shot pilot for Eastern Airlines , but he got canned after an alleged homosexual incident with a 14-year old boy .
BILL: Get Kohlman he told somebody the Texas trip yesterday mentioned to somebody about Ferrie find it out .
NEWSMAN 1: These backyard photos were found yesterday among Oswald 's possessions in the garage of Janet William 's home in Riving , Texas , where Marina Oswald and her children are living . The picture apparently was taken earlier this year . Police say the ifle , a cheap World War II Italian- made Mannlicher-Carcano , was ordered from a Chicago mailing house and shipped to Oswald 's alias A. Hidell at a post office box in March , 1963 . This is the same rifle that was used to assassinate the President .
COX: That ties it up
NUMA: Another nut . Jesus , anybody can get a rifle in Texas .
BILL: So it seems that Dave Ferrie drove off on a Friday afternoon for Texas - a source told Kohlman he might have een a getaway pilot for Oswald .
JIM: Hold your horses . What kinda source ?
BILL: The anonymous kind , Chief .
OSER: I think I remember this guy Ferrie speaking at a meeting of some veteran 's group . Ranting against Castro . Extreme stuff .
NEWSMAN 1: We go back now to the basement of police headquarters where they 're about to transfer Oswald to County Prison
ANNOUNCER: He 's been shot ! Oswald 's been shot !
VARIOUS VOICES: Goddamn ! Look at that Look at that I do n't believe this Right on TV ! What is going on ? Who is this guy oh Jesus . Jim is silent .
LOU: Seventy cops in that basement . What the hell were they doing ?
NEWSMAN 1: Jack Ruby Who is Jack Ruby ? Oswald is hurt .
LOU: Well , no trial now . Looks like somebody saved the Dallas D.A . a pile of work .
JIM: Well , let 's get Ferrie in here anyway .
LOU: Chief David Ferrie .
JIM: Come in , Dave . Have a seat , make yourself comfortable . Coffee ?
FERRIE: Do you remember me , Mr. Garrison ? I met you on Carondolet Street right after your election . I congratulated you , remember ?
JIM: How could I forget ? You make quite a first impression . Sharon , could you please bring us some coffee ? I 've heard over the years you 're quite a first-rate pilot , Dave . Legend has it you can get in and out of any field , no matter how small I 'm a bit of a pilot myself , you know . Flew grasshoppers for the field artillery in the war .
FERRIE: Do you mind if I smoke , Mr. Garrison ?
JIM: How could I ? Dave , as you know , President Kennedy was assassinated on Friday . A man named Lee Harvey Oswald was arrested as a suspect and then was murdered yesterday by a man named Jack Ruby . We 've heard reports that Oswald spent the summer in New Orleans and we 've een advised you knew Oswald pretty well .
FERRIE: That 's not true . I never met anybody named Oswald . Anybody who told you that has to be crazy .
JIM: But you are aware , he served in you Civil Air Patrol unit when he was a teenager .
FERRIE: No if he did , I do n't remembe him . There were lots of kids in and out y'know .
JIM: I 'm sure you 've seen this . Perhaps you knew this man under another name ?
FERRIE: No , I never saw him before in my life .
JIM: Well that must 've been mistaken information we got . Thanks fo straightening it out for us . There is one other matter that 's come up , Dave . We were told you took a trip to Texas shortly afte the assassination of Friday .
FERRIE: Yeah , now that 's true . I drove to Houston .
JIM: What was so appealing about Houston ?
FERRIE: I had n't been there ice skating in many years , and I had a couple of young friends with me , and we decided we wanted to go ice skating .
JIM: Dave , may I ask why the urge to go ice skating in Texas happened to strike you during one of the most violent thunderstorms in recent memory ?
FERRIE: Oh , it was just a spur of the moment thing the storm was n't that bad .
JIM: I see . And where did you drive ?
FERRIE: We went straight to Houston , and then Saturday night we drove to Galveston and stayed over there .
JIM: Why Galveston ?
FERRIE: No particular reason . Just to go somewhere .
JIM: And then Sunday ?
FERRIE: In the morning we went goose hunting . Then headed home , but I dropped the oys off to see some relatives and I stayed in Hammond .
JIM: Did you bag any geese on this trip ?
FERRIE: I believe the boys got a couple .
JIM: But the boys told us they did n't get any .
FERRIE: Oh yes , well , come to think of it , they 're right . We got to where the geese were and there were thousands of them . But you could n't approach them . They were a wise bunch of irds .
JIM: Your young friends also told us you had no weapons in the car . Dave , is n't it a bit difficult to hunt fo geese without a shotgun ?
FERRIE: Yes , now I remember , Mr. Garrison . I 'm sorry , I got confused . We got out there near the geese and it was only then we realized we 'd forgotten our shotguns . Stupid , right ? So of course we did n't get any geese .
JIM: I see . Dave thank you for your time . I 'm sorry it has to end inconveniently for you , but I 'm going to have you detained for further questioning by the FBI .
FERRIE: Why ? What 's wrong ?
JIM: Dave , I find your story simply not elievable .
FBI SPOKESMAN: Gentlemen , this afternoon the FBI eleased David W. Ferrie of New Orleans . After extensive questioning and a thorough background check , the Bureau found no evidence that
NEWSMAN 9: In national news , President Johnson has announced the creation of a blue ibbon presidential commission to probe the events in Dallas . Lou looks at Jim , angry .
LOU: Correct me if I 'm wrong . I thought we were on the same side . What the hell business is it of theirs to say that ?
BILL: Pretty fast , was n't it . The way they let him go .
JIM: They must know something we do n't . So , let 's get on with our lives , gentlemen we got plenty of home grown crimes to prosecute .
NEWSMAN 9: The Commission will be headed by Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court , Earl Warren , and is expected to head off several Congressional and Texas inquiries into the assassination . On the panel are Allen Dulles , ex-chief of the CIA , Representative Gerald Ford , John J. McCloy , former head of Chase Manhattan Bank Jim flicks the TV off as the overture ends .
LONG: Sad thing is the way it 's screwing up this country , all these hippies unning around on drugs , the way young people look you ca n't tell a oy from a girl anymore . I saw a girl the other day , she was pregnant - you could see her whole belly , and you know what she painted on it ? `` Love Child . '' It 's fuckin ' outa control . Values 've gone to hell , Jim Course it figures when you got somebody like that polecat Johnson in the White House .
JIM: I sometimes feel things 've gone downhill since John Kennedy was killed , Senator .
LONG: Do n't get me started on that . Those Warren Commission fellows were pickin ' gnat shit out of pepper . No one 's gon na tell me that kid did the shooting job he did from that damned ookstore .
STEWARDESS: Here you go , Senator Long . The stewardess brings more drinks .
JIM: I thought the FBI test-fired the ifle to make sure it could be done ?
LONG: Sure , three experts and not one of them could do it ! They 're telling us Oswald got off three shots with world-class precision from a manual olt action rifle in less than six seconds - and accordin ' to his Marine uddies he got Maggie 's drawers - he was n't any good . Average man would e lucky to get two shots off , and I tell ya the first shot would always e the best . Here , the third shot 's perfect . Do n't make sense . And then they got that crazy bullet zigzagging all over the place so it hits Kennedy and Connally seven times . One `` pristine '' bullet ? That dog do n't hunt .
JIM: You know , something always bothered me about that from day one , and I ca n't put my finger on it .
LONG: If I were investigatin ' , I 'd round up the 100 best riflemen in the world and find out which ones were in Dallas that day . You been duck hunting ? I think Oswald was a good old-fashioned decoy . What 'd he say ? `` I 'm just a patsy . '' Out of the mouth of babes y'ask me .
JIM: You think there were other men involved , Russell ? Russell looks at Jim quizzically and laughs .
LONG: Hell , you 're the District Attorney . You read the Warren Report - and then you tell me you 're satisfied Lee Oswald shot the President all by his lonesome .
JIM: Russell , honestly you sound like one of those kooky critics spreading paranoia like prairie fire . I just ca n't believe the Chief Justice of the United States would put his name on something that was n't true .
LONG: Honey , another one of these . This one 's as weak as cricket pee-pee . Yessir , you mark my words , Jim , Vietnam 's gon na cost Johnson '68 and it 's gon na put that other varmint Nixon in - then watch your hide , 'cause there ai n't no offramps on a freeway to Hell !
LIZ: Jim , dinner 's just about ready I 've got a surprise for you tried something new Jim ? Jim , dinner .
JIM: Mmmmm sure smells good but Egghead , do you realize Oswald was interrogated for twelve hours afte the assassination , with no lawye present , and nobody recorded a word of it ? I ca n't believe it . A police captain with 30 years experience and a crowd of Federal agents just had to know that with no record anything that Oswald said would be inadmissible in court .
LIZ: Come on now , we 'll talk about it at the table , dinner 's getting cold . What are you doing in here ?
JASPER: Daddy said it was all right if I was eal quiet .
JIM: Sure it is . Freckle Face , if I eve handled a minor felon like that , it 'd be all over the papers . I 'd catch hell . And this is the alleged murderer of the President ?
MATTIE: I never did believe it either !
LIZ: Uh huh Mattie , I 'll do the dishes , you take Be up now . And Elizabeth , too , your bedtime , honey .
JIM: I ca n't believe a man as intelligent as Earl Warren ever read what 's in those volumes .
LIZ: Well maybe you 're right , Jim . I 'll give you one hour to solve the case until the kids are in bed . Then you 're mine and Mr. Kennedy can wait 'til morning . Come on , everybody say goodnight to Daddy .
JASPER: Dad , look what I drew .
JIM: That 's something , Jasper . What is it ?
JASPER: A rhinoceros . Can I stay up anothe hour ?
JIM: Pickle and Snapper , my two favorite dancing partners .
KIDS: Goodnight , Daddy .
LIZ: One hour , y'hear ? Some Saturday night date you are . Mama warned me this would happen if I married such a serious man .
JIM: Oh , she did , huh ? When I come up I 'll show you how Saturday night got invented .
BOWERS: I sealed off the area , and I held off the trains until they could be examined , and there was some transients taken on at least one train .
ATTORNEY: Mr. Bowers is there anything else you told me I have n't asked you about that you can think of ?
BOWERS: Nothing that I can recall .
ATTORNEY: Witness is excused .
SGT. HARKNESS: Well we got a long freight that was in there , and we pulled some people off of there and took them to the station .
JIM: And ?
BOWERS: Towards the underpass , I saw two men standing behind a picket fence they were looking up towards Main and Houston and following the caravan as it came down . One of them was middle-aged , heavyset . The othe man was younger , wearing a plaid shirt and jacket .
JIM: NO !
LIZ: Honey , you all right ?
JIM: It 's incredible , honey - the whole thing . A Lieutenant Colonel testifies that Lee Oswald was given a Russian language exam as part of his Marine training only a few months before he defects to the Soviet Union . A Russian exam !
LIZ: I can not believe this . It 's four- thirty , Jim Garrison . I have five children are gon na be awake in anothe hour and
JIM: Honey , in all my years in the service I never knew a single man who was given a Russian test . Oswald was a adar operator . He 'd have about as much use for Russian as a cat has for pajamas .
LIZ: These books are getting to your mind , Mr. Garrison . I wish you 'd stop eadin ' them .
JIM: And then this Colonel tries to make it sound like nothing . Oswald did adly on the test , he says . `` He only had two more Russian words right than wrong . '' Ha ! That 's like me saying Touchdown here is not very intelligent because I eat him three games out of five the last time we played chess .
LIZ: Jim , what is going on , for heaven 's sake ! You going to stay up all night every night ? For what ? So you 'll e the only man in America who read the entire 26 volumes of the Warren Report ?
JIM: Liz , do I have to spell it out fo you ? Lee Oswald was no ordinary soldier . That was no accident he was in Russia . He was probably in military intelligence . That 's why he was trained in Russian .
LIZ: Honey , go back to sleep , please !
JIM: Goddammit ! I been sleeping for three years !
LIZ: Will you stop rattling on about Kennedy for a few minutes , honey come on .
JIM: Morning , boys . Ready for a walking tour ?
BILL: At 7 30 Sunday morning ? It 's not exactly fresh blood we 're sniffing here , boss .
JIM: Old stains , Bill , but just as telling .
LOU: Yeah , Guy Banister . Ex-FBI man . He died couple years ago .
JIM: 544 Camp Street . Same building as 531 Lafayette , right but different address and different entrances both going to the same place - the offices on the second and third floors .
BANISTER: See this ? What the hell is this doing on this piece of paper ? Asshole .
JIM: He was arrested that day for fighting with some anti-Castro Cubans but actually he had contacted them a few days earlier as an ex-Marine trying to join the anti-Castro crusade . When they heard he was now pro-Castro , they paid him a visit .
CARLOS: He 's a traitor , this man ! Do n't elieve a word he tells you ! You sonofabitch , you liar , you 're a Communist , go back to Moscow .
OSWALD: Okay , Carlos , if you want to hit me , hit me .
JIM: But the arrest gets him a lot of publicity and as a result Oswald appears on a local TV debate that established his credentials as a Communist .
BRINGUIER: But you 're a Communist , are you not , and you defected to Russia .
OSWALD: No , I am not a Communist . But I am a Marxist-Leninist .
BRINGUIER: What did you do when you were in Russia ?
OSWALD: I worked while I was there . I was always under the protection of that is to say , I was not under the protection of the U.S. Government .
BILL: What the hell 's a Communist like Lee Oswald doing working out of Banister 's ?
JIM: Y'ever heard of a double agent , Bill ? I 'm beginning to doubt Oswald was ever a Communist after the arrest , 544 Camp Street never appeared on the pamphlets again . Now here 's another one for you What would you say if I told you Lee Oswald had een trained in the Russian language when he was a Marine ?
LOU: I 'd say he was probably getting intelligence training .
JIM: Lou , you were in the Marines . Who would be running that training ?
LOU: The Office of Naval Intelligence .
JIM: Take a look across the street .
LOU: Post Office .
JIM: Upstairs . In 1963 that was the Office of Naval Intelligence - And just by coincidence , Banister , before he was FBI , was ONI . What do they say ?
LOU: `` Once ONI , always ONI '' ?
BILL: Well , he likes to work near his old pals .
JIM: Bill , Lou , we 're standing in the heart of the United States Government 's intelligence community in New Orleans . That 's the FBI there , the CIA , Secret Service , ONI . Does n't this seem to you a rather strange place for a Communist to spend his spare time ?
LOU: What are you driving at , boss ?
JIM: We 're going back into the case , Lou - the murder of the President . I want you to take some money from the Fees and Fines Account and go to Dallas - talk to some people . Bill , I want you to get Oser on the medical , the autopsy , Susan on Oswald and Ruby histories , tax records
BILL: Lord , wake me , please . I must be dreaming .
JIM: No , you 're awake , Bill , and I 'm dead serious . And we 're going to start y tracking down your anonymous source from three years ago . How did you find out Dave Ferrie drove to Texas that day ?
MARTIN: More than ten years .
JIM: And he never hit you before ?
MARTIN: Never touched me .
JIM: Yet on November 22 , 1963 - the day of the President 's murder - our police eport says he pistol-whipped you with a .357 Magnum . But the police report says you had an argument over the phone bill . Here , take a look at it . Now , does a simple argument ove phone bills sound like a believable explanation to you ?
MARTIN: No , it involved more than that . Bill looks at Jim .
JIM: How much more ?
MARTIN: I do n't know if I should talk about this .
JIM: Well , I 'd ask Guy - we were friendly , you know - heart attack , was n't it ?
MARTIN: If you buy what you read in the paper .
JIM: You have other information ?
MARTIN: I did n't say that . All I know is he died suddenly just before the Warren Report came out .
JIM: Why did Guy beat you , Jack ?
MARTIN: Well , I guess now that Guy 's dead , it do n't really matter it was about the people hanging around the office that summer . I was n't really part of the operation , you know . I was handling the private-eye work for Guy when that came in - not much did - but that 's why I was there it was a nuthouse . There were all these Cubans coming and going . They all looked alike to me .
JIM: And Oswald ?
MARTIN: Yeah , he was there , too sometimes he 'd be meeting with Banister with the door shut . Other times he 'd be shooting the bull with Ferrie . But he was there all right .
JIM: Anything more specific , Jack ? It 's important .
SECRETARY: I ca n't believe it , Mr. Banister . Lee Oswald is down on Canal Street giving out Communist leaflets supporting Castro ! Banister just looks at her and laughs .
BANISTER: It 's okay , Delphine , he 's with us . Back at the racetrack
JIM: Anyone else involved at Banister 's level ?
MARTIN: There was one guy , I do n't know , big guy , business guy , white hair - I saw him come into the office once . He looked out of place , y'know - like a society guy . Ca n't remembe his name . Oswald was with him .
JIM: Bertrand . Clay Bertrand ?
MARTIN: Yeah ! That 's it . I do n't know . Maybe it was n't . I got ta go .
JIM: Clay Bertrand . He 's in the Warren Report . He tried to get Oswald a lawyer . Was Kennedy ever discussed , Jack ?
MARTIN: Sure . 'Course they hated the sonofabitch , but
JIM: The assassination , Jack ?
MARTIN: Never . Not with me sir , never Listen , I think I 'd better go . I said enough . I said all I 'm going to say .
JIM: Hold on , Jack . What 's the problem ?
MARTIN: What 's the problem ? What 's the problem ? Do I need to spell it out for you , Mr. Garrison ? I better go .
JIM: Nobody knows what we 're talking about , Jack .
MARTIN: You 're so naive , mister .
BILL: Well , it 's a terrific yard , Chief , ut the man 's an obvious alcoholic with a reputation lower than crocodile piss .
JIM: Does that bother you , Bill ? I always wondered in court why it is because a woman is a prostitute , she has to have bad eyesight .
BILL: He 'll never sign a statement , boss , let alone get on a witness stand .
JIM: When something 's rotten in the land , Bill , it generally is n't just one fish , we 'll get corroboration find this Clay Bertrand . If I were a betting man , I 'd give you 10 to 1 it 's an alias . Start checking around the Quarter .
BILL: And the six of us , with almost no udget and in secret , are going to solve the case that the Warren Commission with dozens of support staff and millions of dollars could n't solve . We ca n't keep up with the crimes in the Parish as it is , Chief .
JIM: The murder of a President , Bill , is a crime in Orleans Parish too . I did n't pick you because of your legal skill , you know .
BILL: Gee , thanks boss . Jim pulls the car over to park .
JIM: But because you 're a fighter . I like a man who is n't scared of bad odds .
BLACK WOMAN: How ya doing , Mr. Garrison ? Remembe me - from the piano bar at the Royal Orleans ?
JIM: I sure do . We sang `` You 're the Cream in My Coffee . '' She laughs . Others move in on him .
MAITRE D': Mr. Garrison , we have not seen enough of you lately .
JIM: Been too busy , Paul - an elected man ca n't have as much fun as he used to . Welcome back , Lou . Find out anything on those hobos ?
LOU: They took 'em to the Sheriff 's office , not the police station , and they let 'em go . No record of them ever being questioned .
JIM: I ca n't say that comes as a surprise anymore .
LOU: A photographer from The Dallas Times Herald got some great shots of them never published The camera moves in on the photographs .
JIM: Hoboes I knew of old used to sleep in their clothes - these two look pretty young .
LOU: not a single frayed collar o cuff , new haircuts , fresh shaves , clean hands - new shoe leather . Look at the ear of the cop That 's a wire . What 's a cop wearing a headset for ? I think they 're actors , chief ; they 're not cops . Susie Cox arrives .
JIM: Who the hell are they , then ! Hi , Susie , sit down . This could be it . Let 's start looking for 'em .
LOU: Graveyard dead . August this year . A single car accident on an empty oad in Midlothian , Texas . The docto said he was in some kind of strange shock when he died .
JIM: We need to find more witnesses , Lou .
LOU: There was Rose Cheramie . A whore . Two Cubans threw her out of a car on the way to Dallas .
JIM: Can we find her ?
LOU: Graveyard dead near Big Sandy , Texas in '65 . Two in the morning on some highway . A hit and run .
BILL: Why not go right to the horse 's mouth , chief ?
JIM: If we go to him our investigation 'll hit the front pages by sunrise . Blow up right in our face . Ruby was just given a new trial . If he has something to say , it 'll be there . Susie , what did you find out on Oswald ?
SUSIE: Negative on his tax records . Classified . First time I know a D.A . ca n't get a tax record . I put together a list of all the CIA files on Oswald that were part of the Warren Report and asked for them . There are about 1200 documents Oswald in the USSR , in Mexico City , Oswald and the U2 , a CIA 201 personnel file , a memo from the Director on Oswald , travel and activities - ca n't get one of them . All classified as secret on the grounds of national security . It 's real strange .
BILL: Maybe there 's more to this , Susie . The CIA 's keeping something from ou enemies .
SUSIE: Yes , but we 're talking about a dead warehouse employee of no political significance . Three years later and he 's still classified ? They gave us his grammar school records , a study of his pubic hairs Put it in context , Bill , of what we know about Oswald . Lonely kid , no father , unstable childhood , high school dropout - wants to grow up and be a spy , joins the Marines at 17 . He learns Russian , he acts overtly Marxist with two other marines , but he 's stationed at a top secret base in Japan where U2 spy flights ove Russia originate . He 's discharged from the Marines supposedly because his mother 's sick . He stays home 3 days , then with a $ 1500 ticket from a $ 203 bank account , he goes to Moscow
OSWALD: I want to renounce my citizenship and become a Soviet citizen . I 'm going to make known to them all information I have concerning the Marine Corps and my specialty therein , adar operation
SUSIE: Finally they shuttle him to a radio factory in Minks where he lives as high on the hog as he ever has - he 's given 5,000 rubles , a roomy apartment with a balcony , has affairs with local girls .
JIM: Makes sense - he 's a spokesman .
SUSIE: But he never writes , speaks , or does any propaganda for the Russians . He meets Marina , whose uncle is a colonel in Soviet intelligence , at a trade union dance ; she thinks he 's Russian the way he speaks , six weeks late they marry , have a daughter .
NUMA: Did n't someone say he did n't speak good Russian ?
JIM: It 's a contradiction , Numa , get used to them . The only explanation fo the royal treatment is he did give them radar secrets . Or fake secrets .
BILL: Susie , you 're an assistant D.A. , emember . Stick to what you can prove in court .
SUSIE: You want facts , Bill ? Okay . From 1945 to '59 only two U.S. soldiers defect to Russia . From '59 to '60 , seven defect , six return , one of them another Marine a month before Oswald . All of them young men made to seem poor , disenchanted .
JIM: Do n't get sidetracked ! How does he get back to the States ? That 's the point . Does he have any problems ?
SUSIE: None ! The State Department issues him a new passport in 48 hours and loans him the money to travel . He 's never investigated or charged by the Navy for revealing classified information or , as far as we know , debriefed by the CIA .
JIM: This is a man whose secrets cause us to change our radar patterns in the Pacific ! He should 've been prosecuted as a traitor !
SUSIE: The FBI finally gets around to talking to him in Dallas and runs a file on him as a miscreant Communist type .
JIM: But who meets him when he gets off the boat in New York in June '62 ?
SUSIE: Equally incongruous is Oswald becoming chummy with the White Russian community of Dallas - all rabid anti- Communists .
AL: Where 'd you get all this Nazi stuff ?
SUSIE: Read it . They called it `` Project Paperclip . ''
OSWALD: I think he 's made some mistakes on Cuba , but he 's doing a pretty good job . If he succeeds , in my opinion , he 'll be a great President . And a eally attractive one too - open features , great head of hair
JIM: That 's scenery . Do n't get sidetracked . This is the man , bottom line , who nailed Oswald to the Warren Commission as a potentially violent man , and linked him to the rifle .
GEORGE: So , Lee , what are you taking a potshot at this week - rabbits or fascists ? Lee 's look is sickly . He freezes up .
SUSIE: The only Russian that suspects Oswald of still being a Communist is Anna Meller . But her Russian friend tells her `` he 's checked '' with the local FBI and was told Oswald is all right .
JIM: I wonder about the Williams ' . Just where did the first description of Oswald come from at 12 44 ? No one knows . They claimed it was Brennan 's , ut his description came after 1 P.M. Who called ? Somehow the FBI 's een tapping the Williams ' and picks up a call between Bell Helicopte and Janet 's phone , an unidentified voice saying `` We both know who 's esponsible . '' Who called ? Why 's the Bureau been tapping them ?
SUSIE: When he 's arrested , Marina buries him with the public . Her description of him is that of a psychotic and violent man .
MARINA: I do not want to believe , but I have too much facts.. tell me that Lee shot Kennedy .
BILL: I 'm lost , boss . What are we saying here ?
JIM: We 're saying that when Oswald went to Russia , he was not a real defector , that he was an intelligence agent on some kind of mission for ou government and he remained one till the day he died , that 's what we 're saying .
BILL: And therefore because Oswald pulled the trigger , the intelligence community murdered their own commande in chief . That 's what you 're saying !
JIM: I 'll go you one better ! Maybe Oswald did n't even pull the trigger , Bill . The nitrate test indicates he did n't even fire a rifle on November 22nd . And on top of that , they did n't even other to check if the rifle had een fired that day .
BILL: He had his palm print on the weapon .
JIM: It went to the goddamn FBI and they did n't find a goddamn thing . It comes back a week later and one guy in the Dallas police department suddenly finds a palm print which for all I know he could 've taken off Oswald at the morgue . There 's no chain of evidence , Bill . And what about the tow guns actually seen in the Depository ? One an Enfield photographed by a newsman and the other a Mauser , described by Deputy Weitzman Maybe , just maybe , Lee Oswald was exactly what he said he was Bill - `` a patsy '' . Take it at face value . Lou , Susie , I 'm going with my gut here . He 's got an alias of Hidell to buy the rifle , `` O.H . Lee '' to rent the room , right ? What 's in a name , right ? In intelligence , they 're assumed to be fake . A name is sort of like a postbox number , a code - several different people can use the same name , right ? Then why ca n't somebody be using Oswald 's name ? We see blank faces around the table .
BILL: But why ?
JIM: To frame him , obviously . You got to get in your minds how the hell spooks think , Bill ! They 're not ordinary crooks .
LOU: I never could figure out why this guy orders a traceable weapon to that post office box when you can go into any store in Texas , give a phony name and walk out with a cheap rifle which can never be traced .
JIM: Unless he or someone else wants him to get caught . Maybe he never ordered the weapon , Lou . Somebody else did . It was picked up at the post office early morning when Oswald 's time sheet shows him clocked in at his job . Lou , come alive . These things are not adding up .
BILL: I still have to question what the legal basis is that supports this , oss . Susie 's stuff is colorful , ut
JIM: Let 's start making some assumptions about the man . Why would he leave a path as big as Lee Harvey Oswald 's ? This is not a thin trail , gentlemen , it is a very wide one . Who found the evidence ? Who set him up ? Lou , Bill , Susie , I want you to go back and check all the sightings of Oswald in Dallas , New Orleans and Mexico in the summer and fall of '63 - see if it 's the same guy .
AL: Boss , Oswald impersonators ? Sounds like James Bond now .
JIM: Al , you ca n't tell a mink from a coonskin unless you see the fur up close . Goddamn , Sam ! If we do n't start reading between the lines here ! Y'all got ta start thinking on a different level - like the CIA does . We 're through the looking glass . Here white is black and black is white .
BILL: What do you think , Lou ?
LOU: I 'm just an investigator , Bill . I leave the theories to you lawyers .
BILL: You , Numa ?
NUMA: A week ago I would 've said this is nuts , but now There 's a lot of smoke there , but there 's some fire .
BILL: Now you guys , come on . You 're talking about the United States Government here !
JIM: We 're talking about a crime , Bill . No one is above the law . Reduce it . A crime was committed . Let 's get to work .
RUBY: Christ , what the hell kinda needle is that ? I just got a cold fo Chrissake . I do n't want any shot !
DOCTOR: Please relax , Mr. Ruby . This 'll calm you down and clear this up .
RUBY: Doc , I 'm telling you , I do n't need any shots .
DOCTOR: Mr. Ruby , I do n't want to involve the guards . It 'll just take a few seconds .
RUBY: Then do you understand that I can not tell the truth here ? In Dallas . That there are people here who do not want me to tell the truth who do not want me to have a retrial ?
OFFICIAL: Mr. Ruby , I really ca n't see why you ca n't tell us now .
RUBY: When are you going back to Washington , sir ?
OFFICIAL: I am going back very shortly afte we finish this hearing - I am going to have some lunch .
RUBY: Can I make a statement ? If you equest me to go back to Washington with you right now , that is if you want to hear further testimony from me , can you do that ? Can you take me with you ?
OFFICIAL: No , that could not be done , Mr. Ruby . There are a good many things involved in that .
RUBY: What are they ?
OFFICIAL: Well , the public attention it would attract . And we have no place fo you there to be safe , we 're not law enforcement officials , and many things are at stake in this affair , Mr. Ruby .
RUBY: But if I am eliminated there wo n't e any way of knowing . Consequently a whole new form of government is going to take over this country , and I know I wo n't live to see you anothe time . My life is in danger here . Do I sound screwy ?
OFFICIAL: Well I do n't know what can be done , Mr. Ruby , because I do n't know what you anticipate we will encounter .
RUBY: Then you do n't stand a chance , Mr. Chief Justice , you have a lost cause . All I want is a lie detector test , and you refuse to give it to me . Because as it stands now - and the truth serum - how do you pronounce it - Pentothal - whatever it is . They will not give it to me , because I want to tell the truth And then I want to leave this world .
ANDREWS: Why you keep dancing on my head for , my man ? We been thicker ' n molasses pie since law school .
JIM: Because you keep conning me , Dean . I read your testimony to the Warren Commission and
ANDREWS: There you go . Grain of salt . Two sides to every coin .
JIM: You tell them the day after the assassination you were called on the phone by this `` Clay Bertrand '' and asked to fly to Dallas and be Lee Oswald 's layer .
ANDREWS: Right .
JIM: Now that 's pretty important , Dean . You also told the FBI when you met him , he was six foot two . Then you tell the Commission he was five foot eight . How the hell did the man shrink like that , Dean ?
ANDREWS: They put the heat on , my man , just like you 're doing . I gave'em anything that popped into my cabeza . Truth is , I never met the dude .
JIM: Yeah , she was pretty , all right , but not half as cute as you , Deano . You shoulda tried a legitimate line of usiness .
ANDREWS: You ca n't ever say crime do n't pay in Louisiana , Jim - only not as good as it used to . Good chowder , ai n't it ?
JIM: When did you first do business with this Bertrand ?
ANDREWS: Oh , I first heard these street cats jiving about him back in '56 , '57 when I lived down in the Quarter .
JIM: Street cats ?
ANDREWS: Swishes . They swish , y'know . Young fags , you know . They 'd come into my ureau needing help , no bread , and I 'd say , hey man , I ai n't Rockefeller , who gon na back you up ? These cornmuffins go to the phone and dial
CLAY BERTRAND: I 'm Clay Bertrand . Whatever they owe , I guarantee .
ANDREWS: Hey , suits me fine , Daddy Warbucks - how do I get in touch with you ?
CLAY BERTRAND: I 'm around .
ANDREWS: You knew you were n't talking to some low life fag , you know . He had command of the king 's English .
JIM: Did he pay ?
ANDREWS: Always - like tits on a pig . I wish I had a million of those bimbettes .
JIM: And Oswald ?
ANDREWS: Like I told to the Washington boys , Bertrand called that summer and asked me to help the kid upgrade his Marine discharge
JIM: So you saw Oswald how many times ?
ANDREWS: Three , four . He came in with a few Cubano swishes one time I remember
JIM: Did you speak to Oswald in Dallas ?
ANDREWS: Hell , no ! I told this Bertrand cat ight off , this is n't my scene , man . I deal with muni court , I 'm a hack in nigger town , that kid needs a hot dog .
JIM: Then how the hell did you get in the Warren Commission , Dean ? Except through the phone records in the Dallas jail ?
ANDREWS: There were no phone records .
JIM: Of course there were n't . 'Cause they disappeared . And yet the Commission found you , Dean .
ANDREWS: I do n't know how they got to me . Maybe cause I repped him here . The Feebees run background checks . On my mama 's breasts , man , that 's all I got . There was n't no conspiracy , Jim . If there were , why the hell did n't Bobby Kennedy prosecute it as Attorney General , he was his brother fo Chrissake . How the fuck three people could keep a secret like that , I do n't know . It was Oswald . He was a nut job . Faggot , y'know , hated this country .
JIM: Dean , I think we 're having a communication problem . I know you know who Clay Bertrand is . Now stop eating that damn crabmeat for a minute and listen . I 'm aware of our long friendship , ut I want you to know I 'm going to call you in front of a grand jury . I took nine judges on , Deano , right here in New Orleans , and I beat 'em all . If you lie to the grand jury as you 've been lying to me , I 'm going to charge you with perjury . Now , am I communicating with you ?
ANDREWS: Is this off the record , Daddy-o ? In that case , let me sum it up fo you real quick . If I answer that question you keep asking me , if I give you the name of the `` Big Enchilada '' , y'know , then it 's bon voyage , Deano - I mean like permanent . I mean like a bullet in my head . You dig ? Does that help you see my problem a little better ? You 're a mouse fighting a gorilla . Kennedy 's dead as that crab meat . The government 's still breathing . You want to line up with a dead man ?
JIM: Read my lips , Deano . Either you dance into the Grand Jury with the eal identity of Clay Bertrand o your fat behind is going to the slammer . Do you dig me ? Andrews stands suddenly .
ANDREWS: You 're just as crazy as your mama . Goes to show it 's in the genes ! Do you have any idea what you 're getting into , my man ? You think Jack Ruby just up and died of cancer in fou weeks after he gets a retrial ? That 's some kinda new cancer - I 'd say that 's a `` going out of business cancer '' . You got the right ta-ta , but the wrong ho-ho . The government 's gon na jump all over your head , Jimbo , and go `` cock-a-doodledoo ! ''
GUARD: we do n't need no gates out there , sir , we got the `` swamp '' . Many of 'em gone in there but none come out Hey , Willie !
JIM: I want to thank you , Mr. O'Keefe , for this time .
O'KEEFE: Call me Willie . I ai n't got nuthin ' ut time , Mr. Garrison . Minutes , hours , days , years of'em . Time just stands still here like a snake sunnin ' itself in the road
BILL: Clay Bertrand , Willie ?
O'KEEFE: Yeah . Clay . I met him sometime in June of '62 at the Masquerade Bar . Dave Ferrie took me there , for the express reason to meet him .
JIM: For sexual purposes ?
O'KEEFE: Well yeah .
FERRIE: Willie , say hello to Leon Oswald .
O'KEEFE: How ya doing ?
OSWALD: What the fuck 's he doing here ?
O'KEEFE: Fuck you , man .
FERRIE: Leon 's in a bad mood , do n't get excited , he 's all right .
O'KEEFE: Fuck , yes . Hell , I 'm already in jail . I got no reason to lie to you . I ai n't no nigger .
BILL: Go on , Willie .
O'KEEFE: well the party got crazier and crazier , one of those , y'know `` beatnik '' type things .
FERRIE: We 're having a little meeting here . That 's Castro . Sounds like Hitle does n't he ? Sonofabitch is going to go . Real soon .
CUBANS: Muerte a Fidel ! Muerte !
BERTRAND: Oh , stop it already ! What are all these people doing here anyway ? I ca n't bear all this infernal noise .
FERRIE: Clara , do n't be so sensitive .
BERTRAND: I did n't come here for a pep rally . Get all this riffraff out of here .
FERRIE: Okay , okay .
CUBAN: That faggot Kennedy wo n't let us . Our hands are empty - how can we kill him ?
BERTRAND: It 's a real problem getting at him . Castro 's got informers on every block .
FERRIE: Bullshit ! There 's all kinds of new stuff . I heard about rockets in an umbrella - they 're tested at Fort Detrick ? I can show you a dozen poisons . Stick it in his food , he 'll die in three days , no trace . We can put something in his beard , make it fall out , he 'll look fuckin ' idiculous without his beard .
CUBAN: Why do n't we just take care of the main problem ? Which is that piece of shit Kennedy . He 's doing all kinds of deals ! Kissing Khrushchev 's ass . I would n't even call him President Kennedy .
FERRIE: See , what Kennedy done , with him you should take a knife and stab and kill the fucker where he is now . I mean it . This is true . But I tell you something . I hope I get a week 's notice . I 'll kill . Right in the fuckin ' White House . Somebody 's got to get rid of this fucker . Oswald looks up , listens quietly .
O'KEEFE: Oh , c'mon , Dave , you 're never gon na get that sonofabitch .
FERRIE: No ? It wo n't be long , mark my words . That fucker 'll get what 's coming to him . And it can be blamed on Castro . Then the whole country 'll want to invade Cuba . All we got to do is get Kennedy in the open .
BERTRAND: David , David , always some harebrained scheme or another Oh ? What do I see here ? Oooooh , let 's have some more champagne , shall we !
O'KEEFE: What about the Secret Service , the cops ?
FERRIE: No problem if it 's planned right . Look how close they got with de Gaulle . Eisenhower was always riding around in an open top . I know somebody who actually went up and touched Eisenhower once . We need to have three mechanics at three different locations . An office uilding with a high-powered rifle . Triangulation of crossfire is the key . You get the diversionary shot gets the Secret Service looking one way - Boom ! You get the kill shot . The crucial thing is one man has to e sacrificed , then in the commotion of the crowd the job gets done and the others fly out of the country to someplace with no extradition . I could do that myself . I could fly to Mexico , and then Brazil .
BERTRAND: Why do n't we drop this subject it 's one thing to engage in badinage with these youngsters , but this sort of thing could be so easily misunderstood .
FERRIE: Ouch !
JIM: Willie , are you willing to repeat your statements under sodium pentothal ? Under the supervision of a doctor ?
O'KEEFE: Fuck , yeah ! I told you so . And you can tell'em all I told you so .
JIM: You realize the things you 're saying , Willie , are going to be attacked by a lot of different people .
O'KEEFE: Bring on all the motherfuckers ! Bring their college degrees in here ! I got nuthin ' to hide . They ca n't uy me . You ca n't buy me . I do n't even need the parole . This is about the truth coming out . You 're a goddamn liberal , Mr. Garrison , you do n't know shit , cause you neve een fucked in the ass . Fascism is here now , Facism is
JIM: No one 's trying to buy you , Willie . It 's important to know why you 're telling us this .
O'KEEFE: You wan na know why ? 'Cause that mother fucker Kennedy stole that fuckin ' election , that 's why ! Nixon was gon na be one of the great Presidents 'til Kennedy wrecked this fuckin ' country . Got niggers all over the fuckin ' place asking fo their rights , where do you think we got all this fuckin ' crime now , 'cause Kennedy promised 'em too damned much . Revolution comin ' . Fascism 's coming ack . I tell ya this - the day that Communist sumbitch died was a great day for this country . I jes ' hate to think they 're blaming it on some silly fuckin ' Oswald who did n't know shit anyway . People should know why that sumbitch was killed . 'Cause he was a Communist . Put me on the stand , go ahead , I 'll tell the same goddamn story , I 'm proud of it , do n't matte fuck all to me , things do n't change .
SUSIE: Your hunch was right , boss , but it 's even spookier than we thought . Starting in September '63 on , two months before the assassination , there are sightings of Oswald all over Dallas , buying ammunition , getting a telescopic sight fixed , going to rifle ranges Early November , a Dallas downtown Lincoln- Mercury dealership where he tells the salesman Albert Bogard
BOGARD: Three hundred bucks down , Mr. Oswald , you can drive outta here with it . `` Oswald '' , unhappy , starts to leave .
"OSWALD": Who you kidding ! For this heap ? Forget it No honest working man can afford a car anymore in the goddamn country ! Maybe I 'll have to go back to Russia to buy a car
LOU: several witnesses see him on several separate days at different firing ranges . FLASHBACK TO a Dallas firing range in 1963 .
MAN: Hey , watcha doing , boy that 's my target .
"OSWALD": Hey , sorry , buddy . I just thought it was that sonofabitch Kennedy , y'know . I could n't help myself .
JIM: about as subtle as a cockroach crawling across a white rug .
SUSIE: I 'll go you one better , Lou . He shows up at Silvia Odio 's , a Cuban lady in Dallas working in the anti- Castro underground - remember that name , a solid witness . The two Cubans introduce him as `` Leon Oswald '' .
THE BULL: This guy Leon Oswald 's great , he 's kinda nut he told us we do n't any guts , us Cubans , cause Kennedy should 've been whacked after the Bay of Pigs , and some Cubans should 've done that , it 's easy to do , he says - you know he 's a Marine , an expert shooter
SUSIE: It 's like he 's giving her information she does n't even ask for . She 's scared , does n't see them again till she sees Oswald 's picture in the paper . But the Warren Commission says she has bad eyesight because they have Oswald in Mexico at this time , trying to get back into Cuba . The Cubans think he 's a double agent so they wo n't take him . The CIA has a camera outside the Cuban Embassy and says this is Oswald in Mexico . You figure it .
AL: If this is Oswald , it must be ou third Oswald .
JIM: The interesting thing is the extent to which the Warren Commission went to make him a Communist . They got almost 150 pages and 130 exhibits of the report on this Mexico trip and the picture does n't even match . I 'm eginning to think the point of the Mexican episode was to lay the blame at Castro 's door . If Oswald , o someone purporting to be Oswald , had gotten into Cuba , come back , then killed the President , the American public once again would 've screamed for a Cuban invasion
SUSIE: I even have doubts about this photo , oss . It pretty much convicted Oswald in the public mind . Well , according to Captain Fritz , Oswald told him during his interrogation the photo was fake .
OSWALD: That 's not me .
FRITZ: It came from Janet William 's garage .
OSWALD: Well , I never saw that picture . It is my face , but my face has been super-imposed - the rest of the picture is not me at all . I 've done a lot of photographic work , and that picture was made by someone else .
FRITZ: So who the hell are you ? Alex Hidell or Oswald ?
OSWALD: Well , you 're the policeman , you work it out .
SUSIE: Oswald , who worked for Jaggars-Chiles- Stovall , did know spy photography pretty well . I took this picture to two experts . Look at the way the shadows on the nose fall in a straight line like it 's high noon . But the shadow here on the ground reads like late afternoon or early morning . It 's not the same time . Also look at the crop marks across the chin . It seems like his head is pasted on somebody else 's body implicating him with this rifle and gun .
MOBSTER: Clay Bertrand ? Sure I know him . He comes around the Quarter .
BILL: Who is he , Joe ? I 've been to every ar , no one wants to talk .
MOBSTER: I told your uncle I never met a lawman who was n't a punk . You too , Bill , even if you 're family . He 's a big shot businessman . I seen him on the TV news a lot with all the other big shots . A fag , you know . Goes by another name down here .
BILL: What 's the other name ?
MOBSTER: Shaw . Clay Shaw .
BILL: Clay Bertrand is Clay Shaw ? The guy who used to run the International Trade Mart ?
MOBSTER: Yeah , what 's the big mystery ? Everybody down here knows the guy .
BILL: So why does he call himself Bertrand ?
MOBSTER: Who gives a shit what he calls himself ?
SUSIE: now it gets positively spooky . In January , 1961 - in New Orleans , at the Bolton Ford Dealership - when the Oswald we know is in Russia - there is a man using the name `` Oswald '' to buy trucks for the Friends of Democratic Cuba . The salesman neve saw him again , but guess who 's on the articles of incorporation of the Friends of Democratic Cuba ? Guy Banister . Banister has someone using the name `` Oswald '' to buy the trucks . Hoover , at the FBI , writes a memo dated June , 1960 , that there could be someone using Oswald 's passport and identity .
JIM: Goddamn ! They put Oswald togethe from Day One ! Like some dummy corporation in the Bahamas - you just move him around a board . Sent him to Russia , in and out , no passport problems . You got the word `` microdots '' in his notebook , you got the Minox camera and the electronic devices they find in his possessions , the sealed DIZ201 personnel file . For all we know , there could be a dozen Oswalds in different cities , countries - all of them leaving a trail of incriminating evidence that could easily be traced to a scapegoat after the assassination . Does the eal Oswald know he 's been put together ? Who knows . It does n't matter , does it ? He 's a low level spy , he does n't know who he really works for
PAUSE: Let 's call it a night . Anything new on Ruby ?
LOU: Mobbed up all the way . Tight with the Dallas cops . I 'm digging , chief . I just need 10 more men and some more dollars .
JIM: I know you do , Lou . I 'm doing three more lectures this month . You 're all doing an incredible job , Sue , Al , Numa . But this is one where if you do n't nail the other guy , you 're dead . How did Jack Ruby dies so quick ? Of what ? Cancer , right ? A history of Nazi Germany , Lou . They were studying viral cancers as a weapon in the 30 's . We learned a lot more than you think from the Nazis . Read this . Our biological warfare lab is in Fort Detrick , Maryland . Close to where the National Cancer Institute is located . Think about it . Think the unthinkable - question everything .
NUMA: Even my own wife , chief , Who 's wondering where I am ?
JIM: Even your own wife , Numa . Any of you want to quit , do me a favor put us out of our misery .
BILL: I fould Clay Bertrand . They all stop , look .
SUSIE: Who ?
BILL: Grab your socks and pull Clay Bertrand is Clay Shaw
SUSIE: No ! Shaw ! Director of The Trade Mart ? This is incredible .
NUMA: Pillar of the community by day , gay ars at night .
JIM: Can you get some sworn statements ?
BILL: That 's gon na be tough . Nobody 's talking .
JIM: I think we should have him in for a little talk .
LIZ: Do you have any evidence against him , Jim ? Clay Shaw 's done so much for the city with all that restoration in the Quarter . He 's well connected , all his friends , the money , people , e careful , Jim .
JIM: It 'll be off the record , honey . I 'll bring him in on a Sunday . A quiet little chat between gentlemen .
NEWSMAN 10: In heavy fighting in Vietnam today , seven more American soldiers died and 23 were wounded . The body count for this week now stands at 67 Americans and 626 enemy soldiers killed in action .
LIZ: Jim , come on , honey , get down on your hands and knees and hunt fo Jasper 's Easter egg .
JIM: You know I do n't like these tribal ituals , Freckle Face . I 'm interviewing Clay Shaw this morning .
NEWSMAN 10: President Johnson , meanwhile at an informal press conference , said he egretted that there is no end in sight to the war in Vietnam , where 500,000 American troops are now fighting . `` We face more cost , more loss , and more agony . '' In his proposal to raise taxes , Johnson
LIZ: But Jim , we 're going to Antoine 's with the kids - like we do every year .
JIM: No . I told you I was going to talk to Shaw .
LIZ: But why in the Lord 's name would you do it in the middle of Easter Sunday when you knew we were
JIM: Because when I scheduled it I did n't ealize it was a holiday . You were there , why did n't you say something ?
LIZ: Look at the calendar , for Christ 's sake . You said a Sunday , not Easte Sunday .
JIM: I 'm sorry , but it 's important . Clay Shaw is important . I 'm sorry .
LIZ: You 're missing most of your life , Jim , and you do n't even know it . The kids are missing out too . It 's not just you making the sacrifice here , honey .
JIM: Look , I 'll rush and be there by two , I promise . Go ahead without me . As he leaves , the camera holds on Liz .
CLAY SHAW: Mr. Garrison - what can I do for you on Easter Sunday ?
JIM: I 'm sorry , Mr. Shaw , to interrupt this holiday , but I feel this is a conversation we might better have out of the everyday bustle in this office
SHAW: I 'm not sure I understand .
JIM: Well in an investigation we 're conducting your name has come up a number of times .
SHAW: I would n't imagine where .
JIM: We recently talked to a number of men who claim to know you . Are you acquainted with a David Logan ?
SHAW: No . Never heard of him .
JIM: A Perry Russo ?
SHAW: No .
JIM: A Willie O'Keefe ?
SHAW: No , I do n't believe I know anyone by that name .
JIM: Mr. O'Keefe told us he met you at the Masquerade Bar down in the Quarte and several evenings later you had him over for dinner at your apartment on Dauphine Street . Do you recall that ?
SHAW: Not at all . But on the other hand , I do have a lovely Chippendale dining table and I often have a friend ove sitting at one end while I sit at the other . That is precisely the point of a long dining table . The splendor of the meal adds to the enjoyment of it .
JIM: I would imagine a uniformed waite helps .
SHAW: It adds a taste of elegance for which I must confess a weakness for now and then . I call him Smedley . His eal name is Frankie Jenkins - but I could hardly imagine anything more uncouth during dinner than my turning toward the kitchen and hollering `` Frankie ! '' .. Where is this leading to , Mr. Garrison ?
FERRIE: You 're mine , Mary . Go get the fucking tools out , bitch . Now ! I want some ass .
JIM: Let me show you his picture .
SHAW: No . I 'm sure I 've never met anyone of such a bizarre appearance .
JIM: Does the name Clay Bertrand mean anything to you ?
SHAW: Clay Bertrand ? Clay Bertrand ? I elieve there was a man with a name similar to that who worked at the Chamber of Commerce . Is that the man you had in mind ?
JIM: No , it was not . Do you know an attorney by the name of Dean Andrews ?
SHAW: One meets so many attorneys in my usiness . No , I do n't believe I know Dean Andrews .
SNAPPER: I 'm hungry ! When 're we gon na eat !
LIZ: We 're going to start without him and he 'll be here for dessert . Snapper , you put that back !
VIRGINIA: I want a Shirley Temple !
SNAPPER: Me , too .
JASPER: When 's Daddy coming , Mama ?
LIZ: Soon . He 's real sorry he ca n't start with us but he 's promised to be here .
JIM: Mr. Shaw , can you identify this man ?
SHAW: Naturally . Are you claiming , Mr. Garrison , that Mr. Oswald also had dinner with me ?
JIM: Mr. Shaw , did you ever meet Lee Harvey Oswald ?
SHAW: You really have me consorting with a cast of sordid characters , do n't you , Mr. Garrison .
JIM: Please answer the question .
SHAW: Of course not ! Such a pity , that assassination . In fact , I admired President Kennedy . A man with true panache , and a wife with impeccable taste . Jim shows Shaw a newspaper clipping .
JIM: Mr. Shaw , this is an Italian newspape article saying you were a member of the Board of Centro Mondo Commerciale in Italy , that this company was a creature of the CIA for the transfe of funds in Italy for illegal political-espionage activities . It says that this company was expelled from Italy for those activities .
SHAW: I 'm well aware of this asinine article . And I am thinking very seriously of suing this rag of a newspaper .
JIM: It says that this company has heavily Fascist ties to the French secret army organization that tried to assassinate de Gaulle in 1960 .
SHAW: Nonsense . What next ?
JIM: and that this company is linked to the Schlumber tool company here in Houma , Louisiana - which is where their arms may have come from to David Ferrie and his Cubans
SHAW: Mr. Garrison , you 're reaching . I am an international businessman . The Trade Mart which I founded is America 's commercial pipeline to Latin America . I trade everywhere . I am accused , as are all businessmen , of all things . I somehow go about my business , make money , help society the best I can and try to promote free trade in this world .
JIM: Mr. Shaw , have you ever been a contract agent with the Central Intelligence Agency ? Shaw glares at him . Silence .
SHAW: And if I was , Mr. Garrison do you think I would be here today talking to somebody like you ?
JIM: No , people like you do n't have to , I guess - people like you walk between the raindrops .
SHAW: May I go ? Regardless of what you may think of me , Mr. Garrison , I am a patriot first and foremost .
JIM: I 've spent half my life in the United States military serving and defending this great country , Mr. Shaw , and you 're the first person I ever met who considered it an act of patriotism to kill his own president .
SHAW: Now just a minute , sir ! You 're way out of line ! Susie and Bill quiet Jim down .
BILL: Come on , chief . I 'm sorry , Mr. Shaw , it 's getting late . That 's all the questions we have . Thank you for your honesty and for coming in today .
SHAW: I enjoyed meeting with you gentlemen , and you , Miss Cox . It was most pleasant . I wish to extend to each of you - and to each of your families - my best wishes for a happy Easter .
JIM: `` One may smile and smile and be a villain . '' Goddammit ! We got one of 'em !
JASPER: Daddy ! Where have you been ?
JIM: Hi , Freckle Face .
LIZ: Hi .
JIM: Tough day .
LIZ: My sympathies .
JIM: Liz , I 'm really sorry . The meeting went much longer than expected .
LIZ: We waited for you hours , Jim . You could have telephoned , for God 's sake . It 's Easter ! You promised , Jim .
JIM: I do n't know what to say except I 'm sorry . I just do n't have rabbits on my mind .
LIZ: I think you care more about John Kennedy than your family ! All day long the kids are asking , `` Where 's Daddy ? '' What am I supposed to tell your kids , Jim !
JIM: I do n't know what to tell them . How 'bout the truth - I 'm doing my jo to make sure they can grow up in a country where justice wo n't be an arcane , vanished idea they read about in history books , like the dinosaurs or the lost continent of Atlantis .
LIZ: That sounds dandy , but it does n't eplace a father and a husband on Easter Day .
JIM: It 's going to get worse , honey .
LOU: Congratulations , Boss - you 're page one !
JIM: Goddamn Sam !
LOU: And it ai n't pretty `` the AD has spent more than $ 8,000 on unexplained travel and investigative expenses since November ,
NUMA: They went to the public records and got the vouchers we requested fo withdrawals .
SUSIE: Shaw must 've gotten them on our tail .
AL: Could be Ferrie , Martin , Andrews , any of 'em .
BILL: We did n't talk to Ruby 'cause of them and they 're on our asses for a measly $ 8,000 !
JIM: They hunted down the news , it 's thei usiness . Getting angry does n't accomplish a damned thing , but this changes everything . We either pull out now or we go through some heavy flack together . They look at each other .
SHARON: Mr. Garrison , what shall I tell them ? They 're piling up outside the door . They want a statement , the phones are going crazier than bugs on a cake .
JIM: Neither confirm , deny , nor discuss , Sharon . Goodbye , ladies , gentlemen , I 'm going home where I can get a decent day 's work done .
NEWSMAN 11: Mr. Garrison 's own silence on the subject has raised some interesting questions . With taxpayer money has he uncovered some valuable new evidence or is he merely saving the information which will gain for him exposure on a national level ? Mr. Garrison it seems , should have some explanation . The phone rings and Ivon picks it up .
LOU: Yeah ?
FERRIE: Somebody planted that fucking story ! And somebody tipped off the press I 'm one of Garrison 's fucking suspects . I ca n't go home . I 'm out on the street . The maggots are everywhere ! Do you know what you 've done to me ? It 's all ove the national news now . You know what you 've done to me ?
LOU: Calm down , Dave , what ?
FERRIE: I 'm a dead man ! From here on , believe me , I 'm a dead man .
LOU: What are you talking about , Dave ? You were n't mentioned in the story . Do n't jump to conclusions .
FERRIE: You think your investigation 's been all that secret ? You know , when you talk to people , they talk to othe people .
LOU: What did they
FERRIE: You still questioning any Cubans ?
LOU: Dave , you know that 's where this oad leads .
FERRIE: It leads farther than that .
LOU: Dave , just calm down . Meet me in the lobby of the Fontainbleau in 20 minutes . I 'll have a suite reserved for you under an assumed name .
FERRIE: The Fontainbleau ? 20 minutes ?
LOU: Yeah . Come on , Dave , come on ou side . I guarantee you the boss 'll protect you Dave ?
FERRIE: give me protection ?
LOU: Yeah ! He 'd kill for you Dave . He likes you . Your mind .
FERRIE: I got no place to sleep . I 'll meet you in 20 minutes .
KING: President Kennedy said on one occasion , `` Mankind must put an end to war , or war will put an end to mankind . '' I pray God that America will hear this before it 's too late , ecause today we 're fighting a wa I 'm convinced is one of the most unjust wars that has ever been fought in the history of the world .
LIZ: No , he 's not here now . And he would not take calls here if he were ! So please call the office number . Thank you . Two of them even had the gall to come to the door this afternoon , one all the way from England .
JIM: Did they live ?
LIZ: It 's not funny , Jim , I 'm scared .
JIM: Do n't be . Nothing to be scared about , honey , I been through four years of war - this is nothing . The phone rings again .
KING: sending them 8,000 miles away to guarantee liberties in Southeast Asia which they have not found in Southwest Georgia or East Harlem . So we have been repeatedly faced with the cruel irony of watching Negro and white boys on TV screens as they kill and die for a nation that has been unable to seat them together in the same school .
LIZ: I have n't , Jim .
JIM: Nothing is going to happen to you . I wo n't let it .
LIZ: Leave us ALONE for God 's sake ! Oh , it 's Lou .
FERRIE: I 'm caught in the middle . They 're after me . It 's almost over .
LOU: Listen , Dave , why do n't we orde some room service , have a bite , relax . I 'll stay as long as you want .
FERRIE: I do n't know who to trust anymore . Yeah , sure I could use a pot of hot coffee and a few packs of Camels . You got anything new in the investigation ?
JIM: You mean about the Cubans getting trained north of the lake ?
FERRIE: Oh , you got that ? Banister 's pet project . Getting paid by the government to work against the government . Beautiful . What a mind he had , what a guy , Guy . He had all those files .
JIM: Who was paying you , Dave ?
FERRIE: You think I was a getaway pilot fo the assassination , do n't you ?
JIM: I do n't know . Were you ? Who you scared of , Dave ?
FERRIE: Everybody ! The Agency . The Mob . The Cubans . Yeah , follow the Cubans . Check them out . Here , in Dallas , Miami . Check out a guy named Eladio del Valle . My paymaster when I flew missions into Cuba - he 's somewhere in Miami . You 're on the right track .
LOU: Dave , I always play square . No bugs . I 'd love you to go on the record , ut I '' m in no hurry . Whenever you 're eady .
FERRIE: I do n't have much time . They do n't even need bugs anymore . They got these fuckin ' satellite waves . They put a bug in a friend of mine when he was born , right up his nostrils , subcutaneous , between his eyes . He was one of those products of a crossbreading experiment . A Nazi ocket scientist father and a Commie spy mother . You 'd never believe half the shit the Agency does . I 'm so fuckin ' tired . Have n't slept since that shit article came out . Why 'd you guys have to go and get me involved with this ?
LOU: Did we involve you , Dave , or did Clay Shaw ?
FERRIE: That cocksuckin ' faggot ! He 's got me by the balls .
LOU: What do you mean ?
FERRIE: Photographs - compromising stuff . And he 'll use 'em . The Agency plays for keeps I knew Oswald . He was in my Civil Air Patrol unit . I taught him everything . A `` wan na be , '' y'know , nobody really liked him cause he was a snitch . I treated him good . He 'd talk about his kid , y'know , really wanted her to grow up with a chance , ut He got a raw deal . The Agency fucked him . Just like they 're gon na fuck me .
JIM: Let me get this straight , now . Clay Shaw is blackmailing you ?
FERRIE: Fuckin ' A . How do you think the Agency gets people to do thei ullshit ? Fuck knows what they got on Oswald !
JIM: Was it the same Oswald , Dave , that was in Dallas , or was it an impersonator .
FERRIE: Same one . I did n't know no impersonator .
JIM: Did you take a good look at the TV when they had Oswald ?
FERRIE: Black , black - just give it to me . Shit . I 'm so exhausted . My neck is killing me . I 've got cancer . Had it for years . I been working with mice , y'know , trying to come up with a cure .
JIM: Dave , can I just ask you this directly ? Did you ever work for the
FERRIE: You make it sound like some remote fuckin ' experience in ancient history . Man , you never leave the Agency . Once they got you , you 're in fo life .
JIM: And Shaw ?
FERRIE: Shaw 's an `` untouchable '' , man - highest clearance . Shaw , Oswald , the Cubans - all Agency .
JIM: What about Ruby ?
FERRIE: Jack ? Jack was a pimp . A bagman in Dallas for the Mob . He used to run guns to Castro when he was still on our side . Check out Jack Youngblood . Shit - we almost had Castro . Then we tried to whack him . Everybody 's flipping sides all the time . It 's fun ' n ' games , man fun ' n ' games .
LOU: What about the mob , Dave ? How do they figure in this ?
FERRIE: They 're Agency , too . Do n't you get it ? CIA and Mafia together . Trying to whack out the Beard . Mutual interests . They been doing it fo years . There 's more to this than you dream . FBI fucking hates the CIA . Navy Intelligence got something to do with it too . Check out `` Alan Pope '' in Miami . Jack Youngblood . Bill Harvey . Colonel Roselli . The shooter , I hear , was a Dallas cop - the bagman at Ruby 's club . I heard he shot his own partner . Got that ? Check out the rich fucks in Dallas . H.L . Hunt . He 's dirty . That 's all I know . But the Agency always runs the show . Check out something called `` Mongoose '' Operation Mongoose . Government , Pentagon stuff , they 're in charge , but who the fuck pulls whose chain who the fuck knows , fun ' n ' games man - check out Southeast Asia - that 's the next big number - the heroin trail . `` Oh , what a deadly web we weave when we practice to deceive . ''
JIM: Then who killed the President ?
FERRIE: Oh man , why do n't you stop . This is too fuckin ' big for you ! Who did Kennedy ? It 's a mystery wrapped in a riddle inside an enigma . Even the shooters do n't fuckin ' know ! Do n't you get it yet ? I ca n't be talking like this . They 're gon na kill me . I 'm gon na die ! I do n't know what happened . All I wanted in the world was to be a Catholic priest - live in a monastery , study ancient Latin manuscripts , pray , serve God . But I had this one terrible , fatal weakness . They defrocked me . And then I started to lose everything .
JIM: Dave , it 's going to be okay . Just talk to us on the record and we 'll protect you . I guarantee it .
FERRIE: They 'll get to you , too - they 'll destroy you They 're untouchable , man I 'm so fucking exhausted I ca n't see straight .
JIM: Get some rest , Dave , and you 'll feel etter in the morning . We 'll talk then .
FERRIE: Yeah , yeah . But leave me alone fo awhile . I got to make some calls .
LOU: Whatever you say , Dave . I 'll be home . Okay ? Lou and Jim share a look .
FRENCH REPORTER: Paris Match . We are the largest magazine in all of France .
SOVIET REPORTER: My name is Bulgarinov . I am with Literaturnaya Gazeta of Moscow .
AMERICAN REPORTER: Bill Turner . Ramparts .
MAILMAN: Coming through , out of the way .
RECEPTIONIST: You know who killed the President ? Mr. Garrison is busy but his assistant A camera moves by into the interior offices .
CAESAR: Hail ! Et tu , Brutus ?
BILL: And you , too , my friend .
NUMA: Love a duck ! It takes twenty minutes to get into this office these days . Are we famous or what ?
JIM: Notorious is more like it . `` Jim Garrison is right . There has been a conspiracy in New Orleans - but it 's a plot of Garrison 's own making '' and this - `` one of the D.A . 's investigators offered an unwilling witness $ 3000 if only he would fill in the facts of the alleged meeting to plot the death of the President '' How can they write that ? Where did they come up with this ? `` A charlatan , '' `` power-mad , '' a `` hulking
D.A.": `` Morbid Frolic in New Orleans . ''
BILL: The crazies have taken over the asylum ! It 's a zoo out there .
NUMA: Sensational garbage sells newspapers , Jim . What else is new ? Look at the thousands of letters you 're getting . That 's where the heart of the country is . `` Dear Mr. Garrison , God bless you for having the courage to go afte the murderers of President Kennedy . Please do n't stop till they 're behind ars . I am a beautician here in Hannibal , Missouri , and my husband is a janitor in the local high school . We have four kids and not an extra lot of money but we enclose a contribution to help with your work . We are praying for you . God bless , Judith Hardy , Hannibal , Missouri . '' Numa pulls a dollar bill from the envelope .
BILL: That 's fine , Numa , but what about all the people who are n't writing letters . They 're sitting home reading all these lies . I just heard NBC crew 's in town to do a `` White Paper '' - not on the Kennedy killing , but on us . One of their top guys , Harry Stoner , is talking to everybody he can find about you , boss
JIM: Oh Jesus , Stoner ! Why does n't he call me ?
NUMA: What do you want to do , Bill - fold up and close the store ? You sound like it .
BILL: Look , this is bigger than all of us . We ca n't try a case in this atmosphere .
SHARON: Mr. Miller 's been waiting .
JIM: Oh ! Send him in . Denver oilman wants to support the investigation . Bill , I know what you 're thinking , ut sometimes when it makes no sense that 's exactly when you just got ta stick to it , head down .
MILLER: Yes , thank you , Mr. Garrison . You coffee 's almost Turkish down here ut I could get used to it .
JIM: Yes , your letter indicated you were in he oil business up there .
MILLER: I 've done quite well in Denver , Mr. Garrison , but I have to admire someone like you - and I have the means to ack up what I say .
JIM: We can use all the support we can get . I think these might interest you .
MILLER: Splendid , love to see them .
JIM: Germany .
MILLER: You were lucky . I spent three years in the Pacific . I 've never seen an avenue with such a profusion of bail-bonding companies . Why is that ?
JIM: I imagine because this is the Criminal District Court Building This is an enlargement of a potential shooter standing behind the picket fence . We
MILLER: I know about that shot . A terrible tragedy . How much do you have for carrying on your investigation ?
JIM: If you must know , virtually nothing .
MILLER: How many men are working with you on this ?
JIM: Less than you would guess . Most days two to three assistant D.A. 's . A handful of police investigators .
MILLER: That 's all you 've had all this time ?
JIM: That 's it . Jim expectant of some help . A pause . Then
MILLER: I admire you , Mr. Garrison . How did you manage to make your way into Guy Banister 's operation ?
JIM: That was never in he newspapers , Mr. Miller .
MILLER: I 'm going to be very frank with you . You 've done a great job , an astounding job considering the limited resources available to you . But the best you can ever hope for is to stir up a lot of confusion . You 're not going to do this country any good , and you 're not going to do yourself any good . You do n't belong here . On this Mickey Mouse street with that cheap strip of bail bond shops .
JIM: The job manages to keep me pretty usy .
MILLER: Nonsense . You should be in a jo where you can make decisions that have impact , affect the world . Here you 're trying to climb up the steep side of Mount Everest .
JIM: And what would I have to do ?
MILLER: Stop your investigation it was a magnificent effort but it 's over and done with . The press is already on your behind and that 's only the eginning , my boy , only the beginning .
JIM: How long do you think it would take me to be appointed ?
MILLER: Well , ordinarily these things take a long time . But in your case , with your record it can be expedited - easily . I guarantee it .
JIM: Who are you , Mr. Miller ? You see that helmet over there ? I picked that up at the Dachau concentration camp when we liberated it in 1945 . It was the most horrifying sight I 've ever seen , Mr. Miller . Pyramids of decaying , stinking bones and skin one on top of the other . I do n't enjoy looking at that swastika every day , Mr. Miller , but I keep it there to remind me of what can happen when a country turns from free democratic principles to Fascism , when a few madmen turn human beings into digits and millions sit in silence and do nothing about it .
BILL: Well , they offered you the carrot , and you turned it down you know what 's coming next , do n't you , boss ?
LOU: Boss , I tell you something or somebody is putting tremendous heat on David Ferrie . If we sit on our behinds any longer , I do n't think the guy 's going to hold on .
SUSIE: Look at this bullshit ! He keeps changing what he says . We ca n't possibly call him to a Grand Jury .
JIM: Susie , watch the language , would you please .
AL: My instinct is that Ferrie is going to keep on deteriorating , and we 'll end up getting more out of him when he finally cracks . If we call him now , he might freeze up and we could lose the best shot we 've ever had .
LOU: You do n't get it , guys - he ca n't go down any further . We got to protect him full time .
JIM: I have a plane to catch going to Washington . An interesting lead , says he 's closely connected to these events , but he wo n't come down here I know what you 're going through with Ferrie , Lou . We 'll talk tomorrow .
LOU: I 'm onto Ferrie 's Cuban paymaster , Eladio del Valle , in Miami . I got ta get him in , boss . I need more men - I ca n't even pull the teams to watch Ferrie This is our case !
NUMA: HOLD IT , CHIEF
JIM: You just need some sleep , Lou . It wo n't look so bad when
NUMA: Williams found this in your office We think the conference room is also ugged . And maybe the phones . The whole place needs debugging .
JIM: I do n't believe it !
SUSIE: Bugging the District Attorney 's office of New Orleans ! It 's outrageous !
SHARON: It 's urgent for you , Mr. Ivon . Lou goes to the phone .
NUMA: Well , believe what you want , boss , ut we got to be more careful . All these new volunteers , any one of them could be
JIM: Okay , you handle it , Numa . I do n't have time for this nonsense . We 've obviously got the bastards worried now . I 'm going to Washington .
LOU: Dave Ferrie 's dead . The body was found at his apartment two hours ago . Jim 's look says `` There goes the case . ''
JIM: This case is in our jurisdiction . I do n't want anyone from a Federal agency in here without an explicit Federal court order . You got that , Hank ?
NEWSMAN 10: Was Ferrie murdered , Mr. Garrison ? Do you have any leads ?
JIM: What 's it look like , Nick ?
CORONER: I do n't see any violence , Jim . Heart attack , maybe an aneurysm . Looks like natural causes .
BILL: It 's addressed to no one and no signature . `` To leave this life is , for me , a sweet prospect . I find nothing in it that is desirable and on the other hand , everything that is loathsome . ''
LOU: Pretty flowery for Dave Ferrie .
FERRIE'S BEDROOM: Jim hands Lou the medicine bottle .
LOU: Proloid ?
JIM: I took it once for a low thyroid condition It raises the metabolism , Lou . Did David Ferrie strike you as the kind of person who had a low metabolism ?
LOU: I 'd say the opposite - hypertension .
JIM: Ferrie was the only one to express some kind of remorse about this whole thing . I think it got him killed .
SUSIE: Boss , we just got bad news from Miami . They found Ferrie 's Cuban friend - Eladio del Valle - this morning , hacked to death with a machete in his car . He was tortured , shot in the heart at point-blank range and his skull was split open with an axe
LOU: Jesus - if that ai n't the Devil 's piss ! Those bastards !
BILL: Found another note , same thing , no name , no signature . `` When you receive this , I will be quite dead , so no answer will be possible . I offered you love . All I got in return in the end was a kick in the teeth . ''
JIM: Jesus , they must 've been hard pressed to come up with that one .
CORONER: He 'd die pretty quick , either a heart storm or a ruptured blood vessel in the brain .
JIM: Can you ascertain if there 's Proloid in his system ?
CORONER: Not in a routine autopsy , but if we looked at the spinal fluid , there might be a high level of iodine , but it 's difficult to know . Whatcha thinkin ' , Jim ?
JIM: Well , it does n't make sense , Nick - he was afraid of dying , then he kills himself in a way that leaves no trace , ut he leaves two unsigned suicide notes .
CORONER: If it 's a suicide , I seen weirder , Jim .
BILL: The fact is he 's gone , chief , and so 's our case .
LOU: Not unless we go for Shaw now .
BILL: With whose testimony ? Willie O'Keefe ? A male prostitute . Jack Martini ? A drunk ? Vernon Bundy ? A dope fiend . Shaw 's got respect , the newspape editors , the American Bar Association - they 're not
SUSIE: I 'm afraid I 'm with Bill on this one . We have n't got the goods yet .
LOU: We wait , Shaw 's gon na get whacked . Oswald , Ruby , Ferrie , del Valle , Banister , Bowers how many corpses you lawyers got ta see to figure out what 's going on ?
JIM: All right , all right . Break it up .
BILL: Where you going , boss ?
JIM: I do n't know , Bill , I just do n't know .
FRANK: Bill .
BILL: Hey , where y'at , Frank ? You 're wasting your time here . Big Jim gave strict orders . No FBI allowed .
FRANK: It 's you I want to talk to , Bill .
BILL: Boss would fry me in hog fat if he knew
FRANK: Your boss got a serious problem , Bill . Real serious . We know what 's een going on at your office
BILL: Yeah , I guess you do .
FRANK: You 've got nothin ' , Bill . I 'm talking as a friend now . You 're riding on the Titanic . Time to jump off before you get destroyed along with Garrison .
BILL: Frank , I do n't want to hear it .
FRANK: Senator Long set your boss up , my friend . This gets Bill 's attention .
BILL: No , I 'm not
FRANK: Yes , you are . Look we know Oswald did n't pull that trigger . Castro did . But if that comes out , there 's gon na be a war , boy - millions of people are gon na die . That 's a hell of a lot more important than Jim Garrison . Goddammit , look at me when I talk to you ! You 're too goddamn self- opinionated , now shut up . If you got a brain in that thick skull of yours , listen to me . Listen real hard . Bill , taken aback , listens .
JIM: Yes .
JIM: Well , I just hope it was worth my while , Mr
JIM: I 've already been warned by the Agency , Mr. Whoever . If this is another type of threat , I do n't
JACKIE KENNEDY: I never realized Kennedy was so dangerous to the establishment . Is that why ?
JIM: I do n't I ca n't believe it . They killed him because he wanted to change things . In our time - in our country ?
JIM: The size of this is beyond me . Testify ?
JIM: I have n't yet . I do n't have much of a case .
LOU: Mr. Shaw , you 're under arrest , charged with conspiracy and entering into an agreement with other persons for the specific purpose of committing the crime of murder of President John F. Kennedy in violation of
NUMA: It 's either a Mardi Gras outfit , o we got the Marquis de Sade here , chief .
JIM: I do n't care if he was doing it with giraffes in the zoo , Numa , it 's none of our business . Let 's keep this side of it quiet , shall we ?
AL: When you 're in a war , boss , you use every weapon you got .
JIM: Not one word . That 's an order .
OFFICER: Name ? First , middle , last .
SHAW: Clay Lavergne Shaw .
OFFICER HABIGHORST: Address ?
SHAW: 1313 Dauphine , New Orleans .
OFFICER HABIGHORST: Ever use any aliases ?
SHAW: Clay Bertrand .
OFFICER HABIGHORST: Next of kin ?
NEWSMAN 12: Mr. Shaw - What do you have to say ?
ATTORNEY GENERAL: Yes , Mr. Shaw was included in ou investigation and there was no connection found at all between Shaw and the President 's assassin .
JIM: If Mr. Shaw had no connection to the assassination , why did the FBI investigate him ? And why , if they did , is his name not mentioned once in the entire 26 volumes of the Warren Report , even it if is to clear his name ? I doubt this Attorney General would qualify for my staff .
CHIEF JUSTICE: No , I do n't think so . Mr. Garrison has presented absolutely nothing publicly to contradict our findings . As yet I have not heard one fact to efute the Commission determination that Lee Oswald was the lone killer .
JIM: I congratulate Mr. Shaw . Most witnesses have to wait for trial efore they 're allowed to produce sacred cows like the Chief Justice of the land as a character witness , who is of course not under oath and free from the laws of perjury .
NEWSMAN 13: Mr. Garrison , if what you say is even partly true in this case , you ealize you are damaging the credibility of our government , possibly destroying it ?
JIM: Let me ask you is a government worth preserving when it lies to the people ? It has become a dangerous country , sir , when you ca n't trust anyone anymore , when you ca n't tell the truth . I say let justice be done , though the heavens fall .
MERCER: Yes , it was about 11 in the morning . I was driving west on Elm Street toward the Triple Underpass , in a ented car - a blue Valiant . I 'll never forget that day .
FBI AGENT: Jack Ruby .
SECOND AGENT: What about these others ? You said they might be him .
MERCER: They look a little like him . But no , I 'm sure this is the man .
JIM: You mean you identified him on Saturday , the day before Ruby shot Oswald ?
MERCER: That 's right . When I saw him on TV , I was shocked . I said to my family , `` that was the man I saw in the truck . ''
JIM: But you did n't seem nearly so sure in your statement to the Warren Commission .
MERCER: That 's what bothers me , Mr. Garrison . You see , they 've been altered . My statements
JIM: Mrs. Mercer , as a former FBI man , it 's difficult to accept this .
MERCER: I know , but Mr. Garrison , the FBI is just not doing their job .
HUSBAND: I 'm a Republican , Mr. Garrison , and I do n't go in for this kind of government bashing , but I must tell you something 's not right when they do n't even bother to call Julia in front of the Warren Commission .
JIM: They did n't call a lot of people , Mr. Mercer . I think it 's safe to say the Warren Report is a work of fiction .
LOU: Beverly , tell Mr. Garrison about the Carousel club .
JIM: Will you testify , Beverly ?
BEVERLY: I do n't think so , sir .
LOU: I thought when we came here , we had an agreement .
BEVERLY: I just do n't want to become anothe statistic like her . If they can kill the President , do you think they 're gon na think twice about a two-bit showgirl like me ?
LOU: We could call you in , Beverly .
JIM: I know the pressure you 're under , Beverly . Do n't think I do n't . I understand .
PRICE: I saw a man run from this spot and go behind the Book Depository - 30 minutes later I gave this information to the Sheriff .
HOLLAND: I made it very clear to the Warren people one of the shots came from ehind that picket fence . I heard the report and saw the smoke come out about 6 or 8 feet above the ground , right out from under those trees . There is no doubt whatsoeve in my mind
DODD: we , all four of us , all railroad men , standing here , seen about the same thing . The smoke came from ehind the hedge - and a motorcycle policeman dropped his cycle in the street and run up the embankment FLASHBACK to the motorcycle
HOLLAND: we came around here to look fo tracks . It rained that morning and we found a bunch of cigarette butts . Someone 'd been standing about here The camera shows the `` spot '' and Lou sighting .
LOU: This is a good spot , chief , for the head shot . Jim looks , reliving the moment .
JEAN HILL: I was standing here next to my friend Mary Mooman , who took the photograph when he was killed
FIRST AGENT: Secret Service , ma'am . You 're coming with us .
JEAN HILL: Oh no , I 'm not . I do n't know you . We got ta catch this shooter - do n't you realize ?
SECOND AGENT: I said you 're coming with us . I want the pictures in your pocket .
JEAN HILL: I do n't have any pictures ! I have to go back and find my friend Mary . Lem me alone ! The two agents hustle her away .
FIRST AGENT: Hush ! Just smile and keep walking .
MAN: How many shots you say you heard ?
JEAN HILL: Four to six .
MAN: That 's impossible . You heard echoes echoes . We have three bullets and three shots which came from the Book Depository and that 's all we 're willing to say .
JEAN HILL: No , I saw a guy shooting from ove there . He was behind that fence . What are you going to do about it ?
MAN: We have that taken care of . You only heard three shots and you are not to talk to anyone about this . No one , you hear ?
JEAN HILL: He asked me why I thought I was in danger and I said
LAWYER: That does n't make sense , Mrs. Hill . We have the man that killed the President .
JEAN HILL: No , you do n't !
LAWYER: I want the truth .
JEAN HILL: The truth is that I heard between four and six shots . I 'm not going to lie for you .
LAWYER: you heard echoes .
JEAN HILL: No . I had guns all my life . I used to go turtle shooting .
LAWYER: I realize you 're under a great deal of stress .. it 's clouded you judgement .
JIM: Are you willing to testify , Mrs. Hill ? Back at the Knoll .
JEAN HILL: Damned right I would . Somebody 's got to tell the truth around here 'cause the Government sure ai n't doing it .
LOU: The Zapruder film establishes 3 shots in 5.6 seconds . Here . I 'm Oswald . Time me .
JIM: Go !
LOU: Time ?
JIM: Between six and seven seconds .
LOU: The key is the second and third shots came right on top of each other , and it takes a minimum 2.3 seconds to ecycle this thing . The other problem is there was a tree right there Blocking the first two shots at the time they occur in the Zapruder film .
JIM: Did n't Hoover say something about that ? The leaves had fallen off in November ?
LOU: It was a Texas Live Oak , boss . It sheds it 's leaves the first week of March . You try to hit a moving target at 88 yards through heavy foliage with this cheap 13-dolla sucker , the world 's worst shoulde weapon . No way . The FBI tried two sets of tests and not one of thei sharpshooters could match Oswald 's performance . Not one . And Oswald was at best a medium shot . The scope was defective on it , too . I mean this is the whole essence of the case to me . The guy could n't do the shooting . Nobody could . And they sold this lemon to the American public .
JIM: The Zapruder film is the proof they did n't count on , Lou . We got ta get our hands on it .
LOU: That means we got ta subpoena Time- Life on it .
JIM: Why not just shoot Kennedy coming up Houston ? There 's plenty of time - he 's out in the open - a frontal shot ?
LOU: I asked myself the same thing . Common sense . Even if you miss the first shot , if he accelerates you still got him for a second shot . No the only reason for waiting to get him on Elm is you got him in a triangulated crossfire . You got him on a flat low trajectory from the front at the fence there .
JIM: How many men ?
LOU: One shooter . One spotter on a radio . Maybe three teams . I 'd say these were professional riflemen , chief , serious people . Hunters patient . It takes skill to kill with a rifle , that 's why there 's been no execution of an executive with one in 200 years `` 3-2-1 green ! '' Or else `` Abort ! Abort ! ''
JIM: Who do you think changed the parade oute ?
LOU: Beats me . City officials . Secret Service . Dallas police . They did a dry run with Chief Curry a few days efore . But they did n't bothe unning through Dealey . They stopped ight there , said something like , `` and afterwards there 's only the freeway , '' and went home .
JIM: You know who the mayor was ?
LOU: No .
JIM: Earle Cabell . And guess who his other is ?
LOU: Who ?
JIM: General Charles Cabell . Deputy Director of the CIA . Fired by Kennedy in '61 because of the Bay of Pigs fiasco , he moved back to the Pentagon , called Kennedy a `` traitor '' . When he came to New Orleans to address the Foreign Policy Association , you know who introduced him ? Our friend Clay Shaw .
LOU: The Warren Commission call him ?
JIM: His boss was the one on the Warren Commission who handled all the leads to the intelligence community .
LOU: Allen Dulles ?
JIM: Head of the CIA since '53 . Kennedy fired them both . Cabell was his deputy for nine years . Talk about the fox investigating the chicken coop . Now we 'll have to subpoena them , Lou .
LOU: They 're gon na love you , chief .
JIM: Maybe we should just call it a day , Lou . Go home . While we 're still a little behind . We got two people killed , maybe more we never thought about .
LOU: You never got anyone killed , boss . Their actions killed them years efore . If we stopped now , it 'd be even more wrong .
JIM: Subpoena them , Lou - Dulles , the Cabells , Time-Life the whole damned lot of 'em !
AL: The U.S. Attorney in Washington `` declines '' to serve our subpoena on Allen Dulles , Charles Cabell , CIA Director Richard Helms , or any FBI agent we named .
JIM: Well , what do you expect from a pig ut a grunt .
AL: Without them , it 's going to be nea impossible , chief , to prove Shaw 's connection to the CIA . We got the same problem with the governors . All of them . Reagan in California wo n't give us Brading , Ohio refuses Orville Townsend , Texas on Arcacha , and Nebraska on Sandra Moffet .
BILL: What the hell is going on ? Neve efore has an extradition request from this office been refused .
AL: We have n't tried to get Julia Anne Mercer in ?
JIM: No , she could get hurt . If you elieve what 's happening to these other people .
NUMA: She 's the best damn witness we have !
JIM: I just do n't want to do it . What else ?
NUMA: Hate mail here . Fan mail here . The ad news is the IRS has just requested an audit on your income from this office .
JIM: I expected that two months ago , and they 're wasting their time The ad news is the National Guard has just asked me to resign after 18 years . Well , maybe that 's good news - it was never as good as combat , but this is . Bill , any more on Oswald and Shaw ?
BILL: Yeah . They were seen together in Clinton in early September . The Civil Rights Movement was running a voter registration drive .
LOU: You know you keep saying that .
BILL: Keep saying what ?
LOU: You 're not digging .
JIM: I think Clinton is a breakthrough . Shaw denies he knows Ferrie or Oswald . Is that right ? It proves he 's a liar . Keep on it , Bill .
SUSIE: This is interesting - are you ready for this ? Oswald went to see the FBI two weeks before the assassination . It seems Special Agent Hosty made three routine visits to his house , supposedly to keep an eye on Marina Oswald .
OSWALD: I want to see Special Agent Hosty .
RECEPTIONIST: I 'm sorry , he 's not in . Can someone else help you ?
OSWALD: Can I use a pen ?
SUSIE: But what the note really said no one knows because his boss Shanklin told Hosty
SHANKLIN: Oswald 's dead now . There 's no trial . Get rid of it . I do n't even want this in the office . Get rid of it , Hosty .
JIM: This is just speculation , people , ut what if the note was describing the assassination attempt on J.F.K. ? Come on guys , think - that 's the only reason to destroy it , because if it was any kind of threat , like Hosty said , they would 've kept it 'cause it makes their case against the `` angry lone nut '' stronger ! Remember the New Orleans meeting with Agent Quigley the day he got usted ?
JIM: William Walter , the night clerk on duty here in the FBI office , gave me a copy of this . It went all ove the country . Nothing was done , and the motorcade went ahead on schedule - and this was n't even mentioned in the Warren Report ! Read it , Al .
OSWALD: I can get you in and up there . This is a shot out the southeast window of the sixth floor . That floor will e unoccupied between noon and one .
BULL: What about the elevator ?
OSWALD: I can close it off . The only access is a stairwell .
BULL: We get them in as an air-conditioning unit .
RUBY: No . A floor refurbishing group . Got the van , the uniforms
OSWALD: if we can get the motorcade to turn from Main onto Houston , that 'll do the trick , 'cause it 'll slow down to make the turn here . You ca n't miss . He 's a dead duck .
BILL: I do n't buy it , chief - why would the FBI cover it up ? You 're talking the whole FBI here . A telex that disappears from every single FBI office in the country ?
JIM: There 's a word - orders . Back in Garrison 's office in 1968 .
SUSIE: Or a cover up ! Jesus , Bill , do n't you have enough proof of the FBI 's complicity now ?
BILL: Maybe I have a little more respect for this country 's institutions than you do , Susie . You tell me how the hell you can keep a conspiracy going etween the Mob , the CIA , FBI , and Army Intelligence and who knows what else , when you know you ca n't even keep a secret in this room between 12 people ! We got leaks everywhere ! We 're going to trial here ! What the hell do we really got ? Oswald , Ruby , Banister , Ferrie are dead . Shaw - maybe he 's an agent , I do n't know , ut as a covert operator in my book he 's wide open for blackmail 'cause of his homosexuality .
JIM: Shaw 's our toehold , Bill . I do n't know exactly what he is , where he fits , and I do n't care . I do know he 's lying through his teeth and I 'm not gon na let go of him !
BILL: So for those reasons , you 're going to trial against Clay Shaw , chief ? Well , you 're gon na lose ! We should e investigating all our Mafia leads here in New Orleans - Carlos Marcello , Santos Trafficante - I can buy that a hell of a lot easier than the Government . Ruby 's all Mob , knows Oswald , sets him up . Hoffa - Trafficante - Marcello , they hire some guns and they do Kennedy and maybe the Government does n't want to open up a whole can o'worms there ecause it used the Mob to get to Castro . Y'know , Castro being assassinated sounds pretty wild to John Q . Citizen . So they close the ook on J.F.K . It makes sense to me .
JIM: I do n't doubt their involvement , Bill , but at a low level . Could the Mob change the parade route , Bill , or eliminate the protection for the President ? Could the Mob send Oswald to Russia and get him back ? Could the Mob get the FBI , the CIA , and the Dallas Police to make a mess of the investigation ? Could the Mo appoint the Warren Commission to cover it up ? Could the Mob wreck the autopsy ? Could the Mob influence the national media to go to sleep ? And since when has the Mob used anything but .38 's for hits , up close ? The Mob would n't have the guts o the power for something of this magnitude . Assassins need payrolls , orders , times , schedules . This was a military-style ambush from start to finish a coup d'etat with Lyndon Johnson waiting in the wings .
BILL: Oh , now you 're saying Lyndon Johnson was involved ? The President of the United States ?
JIM: I know this , Bill - Lyndon Johnson got $ 1 billion for his Texas friends , Brown and Root , to dredge Cam Ranh Bay for the military in Vietnam . That 's just for openers .
BILL: Boss , are you calling the President a murderer ?
JIM: If I 'm so far from the truth , why is the FBI bugging our offices ? Why are our witnesses being bought off and murdered ? Why are Federal agencies blocking our extraditions and subpoenas when we were neve locked before ?
BILL: Maybe 'cause there 's some rogue element in the Government !
JIM: With a full-blown conspiracy to cove it up ? Y'ever read your Shakespeare , Bill ?
BILL: Yeah .
JIM: Julius Caesar `` Brutus and Cassius , they too are honorable men . '' Who killed Caesar ? Twenty , twenty-five Senators . All it takes is one Judas , Bill - a few people , on the inside , Pentagon , CIA
BILL: This is Louisiana , chief . How the hell do you know who your daddy is ? 'Cause your momma told you so You 're way out there taking a crap in the wind , boss , and I for one ai n't going along on this one . Jim sighs , saddened . Bill was one of his best men .
LOU: Chief , I 've had my doubts about Bill for a long time . He 's fighting everything .
JIM: We need him back .
AL: Bill wasted a goddamn month trying to prove that mob boys like Barding and Jack Ruby played ball in right field with Hunt Oil .
LOU: I do n't trust the guy .
JIM: Gentlemen , I will not hear this . I value Bill as much as anyone here . We all need to make room for someone else 's ideas , Lou , especially me . Maybe Oswald is what everyone says he is and I 'm just plain dumb wrong .
AL: I 've seen him copying files , leaving here late at night .
LOU: I just plain do n't trust him anymore .
JIM: Maybe you did n't hear what I said . I will not tolerate this infighting among the staff , I warn you that
LOU: Boss , then I 'm afraid I ca n't continue working with Bill . Tension , silence .
JIM: Are you giving me an ultimatum , Lou ?
LOU: Well , if that 's what you want to call it . I did n't ever think it would come to this . I guess I am , oss .
JIM: I will not have any damned ultimatums put to me , Lou . I 'll accept you esignation .
LOU: You sure got it . You 're one stubborn and stupid sonofabitch D.A . and you 're making one hell of a mistake ! He storms out .
SUSIE: Are n't you being a little hard ?
JIM: No , I do n't think I am , Susie . Anyone else ?
MATTIE: My God ! My God ! What have they done ! It 's lynchin ' time !
VIRGINIA: I 'll get it . Hello .
MALE VOICE: Hello . Is this Jim Garrison 's daughter ?
VIRGINIA: Yes ?
MALE VOICE: Virginia or Elizabeth ?
VIRGINIA: Virginia .
MALE VOICE: Virginia , you 're a lucky little girl . Your daddy has entered you in a beauty contest . Would you like to be in a eauty contest ?
VIRGINIA: That sounds fun .
MALE VOICE: I need some information from you then . How old are you ?
VIRGINIA: Six .
MALE VOICE: And how tall are you ?
NEWSMAN 9: To repeat - 39-year-old Martin Luthe King , who preached non-violence and won the Nobel Peace Prize , was cut down earlier today by a sniper 's ullets while standing on the porch of the Lorraine Motel in Memphis , Tennessee . He was surrounded by his closest aides . The police say they have no suspects at this time . Mr. King
MALE VOICE: And you get of from school at 3 every day ?
VIRGINIA: Yes .
MALE VOICE: Do you walk home ?
VIRGINIA: Uh huh .
LIZ: Who are you talking to ?
MALE VOICE: Okay , Virginia , that 's all I need to know . I 'll call you again when it 's time for the beauty contest .
LIZ: Who 's this ? Hello ? Hello ? After a pause , the man hangs up .
VIRGINIA: Mama , I 'm going to be in a beauty contest !
LIZ: What did he ask you ?
VIRGINIA: Well , he asked me everything . He asked me
LIZ: Did you enter Virginia into a beauty contest ?
JIM: What ?
LIZ: A man just called . He asked he everything !
JIM: Honey , some crackpot . Martin Luthe King was killed in Memphis today !
LIZ: Your daughter 's life was just threatened !
JIM: Just a crank making phone calls . Happens a dozen times a day at the office .
LIZ: Our home , Jim ! A kidnapper , a murderer , who knows !
JIM: Only cowards make crank calls , sweetheart , nothing is going to happen .
LIZ: How do you know ? How do you even know what goes on in this house anymore ! You 're too busy making speeches , stirring up every crazed Klansman in Louisiana after us !
JIM: Get a hold of yourself .
LIZ: I 'm leaving . I 'm taking the kids and I 'm leaving ! I wo n't stand it anymore .
JIM: Honey , come on . The government wants you to be scared . They want everybody to be scared to speak out . They count on it . But there 's nothing to e scared of .
LIZ: You and your government ! What 's the matter with you ? Do n't you have any feelings ? Your daughter ! What kind of man are you ?
JIM: I 'll take them up to my mother 's if it 'll make you feel better . Spend a week . I 'll change the locks , the phone lines , I 'll even get a odyguard , all right ? Elizabeth , get a hold of yourself .
LIZ: Jim , before this Kennedy thing , nothing mattered to you in this life more than your children . The othe night Jasper tried to show you a drawing . You did n't even notice he was there . He came to me bawling his little eyes out . Jim , he 's sensitive - he needs more from you .
JIM: I promise I 'll make more time fo Jasper .
LIZ: Is it such a chore ? I do n't understand you .
JIM: Damn it , if I say I 'll spend more time with him , I 'll spend more time with him . I ca n't fight you and the world too , Liz .
LIZ: I 'm not fighting you , Jim , I 'm just trying to reach you . You 've changed .
JIM: Of course , I 've changed ! My eyes have opened , and once they 're open , elieve me , what used to look normal seems insane ! And now King . Do n't you think this has something to do with that ? Ca n't you see ?
LIZ: I do n't want to see , goddammit ! I 'm tired . I 've had enough ! They say you do n't have anything anyway ! Everybody in town 's talking . You 're uining this man Shaw 's life ! You 're attacking him because he 's homosexual ! Going ahead with this stupid `` trial '' ! Did you ever once stop and conside what he 's going through ?
JIM: That 's not why I 'm attacking him ! You do n't believe me - all this time you never believed me .
LIZ: Oh , I do n't know anymore ! I believe there was a conspiracy , but not the government . I just want to raise our children and live a normal life ! I want my life back !
JIM: Well so do I , goddammit ! So do I ! I had a life too , y'know - I had a life , too . But you just ca n't bury your head in the sand like some ostrich , goddammit , Elizabeth ! It 's not just about you - and your well- eing and your two cars and you kitchen and your TV and `` I 'm jes fine honey . '' While our kids grow up into a shithole of lies ! Well , I 'm not `` fine '' about that , I 'm angry . My life is fucked , Liz ! And yours is , too ! And if you do n't want to support me I can understand that but do n't you go start making threats of taking the children away .
LIZ: You never talked to me this way efore , Jim Garrison . I 'm not making any threats . I 'm leaving you . I 'm taking the kids to my mother 's . I am - I am .
JIM: Go on then , get out ! Go hide someplace . Join the rest of them ! They 'll tell you I 'm crazy . You got plenty of people 'll tell you Jim Garrison 's crazy . You wo n't have a problem filing your divorce papers on me somebody 's got to try , goddammit , somebody !
JASPER: Are we going away , Daddy ?
JIM: Well , it looks like it , Jasper .
JASPER: Because of Kennedy ? Are the same people gon na kill us , Daddy ?
JIM: No , Jasper , nobody 's gon na kill us .
VIRGINIA: Do you love us ?
JIM: Yes , of course I do , honey .
VIRGINIA: No . I mean like mommy loves us . She really loves us .
JASPER: I 'm scared .
JIM: There 's nothing wrong with feeling a little scared , Jasper , Virginia . Telling the truth can be a scary thing . It scared President Kennedy , ut he was a brave man . If you let yourself be too scared , then you let the bad guys take over the country , do n't you - and then everybody gets scared .
SIDEKICK: And now , Jerry , here 's Big Jim Garrison , District Attorney of New Orleans , Louisiana .
JOHNSON: Welcome , District Attorney Garrison . May I call you Jim ?
JIM: I 've been called everything unde the sun , Jerry . Call me whateve you like . He reads from a script on the desk .
JOHNSON: First we had your charge that the Cuban exiles killed the President , then the Mob , then you said the oil illionaires did it , then you said the Minutemen and the Ku Klux Klan collaborated to do it , now your latest theory seems to be that the CIA and the FBI and the Pentagon and the White House all combined in some elaborate conspiracy to kill John Kennedy . Let me ask you , is there anyone besides Lee Harvey Oswald who you think did not conspire to kill the President ?
JIM: How many hours do I have to answe that one ? Well let 's just say this , Jerry - I 've stopped beating my wife . Or maybe you should ask Lyndon Johnson . We know he has some answers .
JOHNSON: There have been a number of reports in reputable news media - Time , Newsweek , our own NBC - that you have gone way beyond the legal means available to a prosecutor , that you 've intimidated and drugged witnesses , ibed them , urged them to commit perjury . What is your response ?
JIM: Your faith in the veracity of the major media is touching , Jerry . It indicates that the Age of Innocence is not yet over . But seriously , Jerry , people are n't interested in Jim Garrison - they want the hard evidence ! They want to know why he was killed and what forces were opposed to
JOHNSON: Some people would say you 're paranoid .
JIM: Well , if I am , why is the Government concealing evidence ?
JOHNSON: Are they ? Why would they ?
JIM: That 's exactly my question , Jerry . Maybe I 'd better show you some pictures so you can begin to understand what I am talking about .
JOHNSON: Pictures like this do n't show up on television !
JIM: Sure they do . The camera can pick this up .
JOHNSON: No , it ca n't !
JIM: Those men you just saw were arrested in Dallas minutes after the assassination . They were never seen again . No record of arrest , no fingerprint , no mugshot , nothing . They all got away .
JOHNSON: We 'll be back after these messages .
AL: Jim , bad news . Bill 's turned , boss . I think he 's given everything we 've got to the Feds .
NUMA: We studied the memos - there was nothing there , chief , nothing ! When we went to confront him , the landlady said that sonofabitch just took off , left everything .
SUSIE: I 'm sorry .
JIM: I know .
LIZ: I 'm sorry .
NUMA: Something sure scared him .
JIM: Bill does n't scare that easy . Somebody got to his thinking . He was never that good a thinker . On the TV , the news is on .
NEWSMAN 9: Much is at stake tonight in California . Public opinion polls show Senator Robert Kennedy of New York leading Senator Eugene McCarthy of Minnesota . Their anti-Vietnam War message is obviously striking a chord with the voters , and whoeve wins tonight will certainly emerge as the favorite over Vice-President Humphrey to win the nomination in Chicago in August . That man now seems to be Senator Kennedy .
NUMA: Sure sounds like he 's winning .
JIM: He 'll never make it . If he wins , they 'll kill him . He wants to avenge his brother . He 'll stop that war . No , they 'll kill him before they let him become President . Liz shares a look with Al and Numa .
AL: Boss , with Broussard they have everything . All our witnesses , ou strategy for the trial . We 'd have to doublecheck all his work , there could be false leads we got ta ethink this trial . We do n't have a choice .
JIM: I do n't think so , Al . You remembe the Hemingway story , `` The Old Man and the Sea '' ? The old fisherman manages to catch this great fish - a fish so huge he has to tie it to the side of the oat to get it back in . But by the time he reached shore , the fish had long since been picked apart by sharks and nothing was left but the skeleton .
NUMA: Then what are we going through all this trouble for ?
JIM: It 's a means to an end . This wa has two fronts - in the court of law , we hope , against the odds , to nail Clay Shaw on a conspiracy charge . In the court of public opinion , it could take another 25 or 30 years for the truth to come out , but at least we 're going to strike the first low .
LIZ: And if you 're wrong ?
JIM: I never doubted for a second that I was . Will you come to the trial , Elizabeth ?
LIZ: I do n't think so , Jim She walks out .
NEWSMAN 1: With 53 % of the precincts reporting , Senator Kennedy continues to hold a lead of 48 % to 41 % over Senato McCarthy . CBS News has projected Senator Robert Kennedy the winner of the crucial California primary .
ROBERT KENNEDY: and that is what has been going on within the United States over the last three years - the division , the violence , the disenchantment , whethe it 's between blacks and whites , etween poor and the more affluent , or between age groups or the war in Vietnam - we can start to work together . We are a great country , an unselfish country and a compassionate country . I intend to make that my basis for running .
JIM: They killed him , honey .
LIZ: Huh ?
JIM: He won and they killed Robert Kennedy . They shot him down .
LIZ: Oh no ! No ! I ca n't believe it . I ca n't believe it . Both of them , oth brothers , oh my God !
JIM: I wish I could 've loved you more I feel sometimes like I did n't ever.. love you or the children enough I 'm sorry .
O'KEEFE: That 's Clay Bertrand . That 's the man I saw at David Ferrie 's . Irvin Dymond cross-examines O'Keefe .
DYMOND: That 's who you say you saw a confessed homosexual , convicted of solicitation , pandering a man who has lied about most everything , who
BUNDY: It was that man there , yessir . He was at the Pontchartrain wall with the man who shot the President . I emember him cause o ' his limp there .
DYMOND: A heroin addict , injecting himself at the wall , barely conscious
COLLINS: that was the man there . He dropped Oswald off on the voter line . I emember 'cause they were the only white strangers around that morning . That big , black Cadillac of his made me think they might be FBI . TIME CUT TO the Town Marshall on the stand .
TOWN MARSHALL: said he was a representative of one International Trade Mart in New Orleans .
DYMOND: more than five years ago , for two minutes . It 's fair to say you could e mistaken , is n't it ?
ANDREWS: figment of my imagination The cat 's stewing me , the oyster 's shucking me I told him , you got the ight at-at but the wrong oh-oh Bertrand is not Shaw , scout 's hono and you can tell him I said so
SUSIE: Objection , your Honor . This office has won a conviction of perjury against Dean Andrews on this matter .
DYMOND: Exception taken . That case is on appeal ! Arguments follow .
GOLDBERG: I did .
DYMOND: Why ?
GOLDBERG: Well , I wanted to make sure she 's the same girl I sent .
DYMOND: I see and why are you experiencing this paranoia ?
GOLDBERG: Well , you see , I 've been subject to hypnosis and psychological warfare ever since 1948 , when I was in Korea
AL: He was one of Broussard 's witnesses , chief . I 'm sorry . He was totally sane when we took his affidavit .
SUSIE: But how does Dymond know what to ask ? FUCK ! We 're dead .
GOLDBERG: When someone tries to get you attention - catch your eye - that 's a clue right off .
GARRISON: Your Honor , I call police office Aloysisus Habighorst to the stand .
JUDGE HAGGERTY: I 'm going to have to ask the jury to leave the courtroom .
GARRISON: What ?
JUDGE HAGGERTY: I 'm sorry , Jim , but the defendant did not have his lawyer present when asked .
HABIGHORST: Any alias ?
SHAW: Clay Bertrand .
JUDGE HAGGERTY: I call'em as I see'em , Jim . I 'm uling it inadmissible .
GARRISON: That 's our case !
JUDGE HAGGERTY: If that 's your case , you did n't have a case . I would n't believe whateve Habighorst said , anyway .
GARRISON: I ca n't believe you 're saying this in the courtroom .
JUDGE HAGGERTY: Well , I am saying it . Bring in the jury .
AL: We 're filing for a writ to the appellate court .
JUDGE HAGGERTY: You do that .
DYMOND: Oswald ?
SHAW: No , I did not .
DYMOND: ever called Dean Andrews ?
SHAW: No , I did not .
DYMOND: and have you ever met David Ferrie ?
SHAW: No , I would not even know what he looked like except for the pictures I 've been shown .
DYMOND: did you ever use the alias Clay Bertrand ?
SHAW: No , I did not .
DYMOND: Thank you Mr. Shaw . Jim rises slowly out of his chair .
JIM: Well , a very great actor has just given us a great performance , You Honor , but we are nowhere closer to the truth . Let it be noted , my office is charging Clay Shaw with outright perjury on the fifteen answers he has given , not one word of this
JUDGE HAGGERTY: You 're out of order , Jim Boy , now sit down . Strike those remarks ! !
JIM: To prove their was a conspiracy involving Clay Shaw we must prove there was more than one man involved in the assassination . To do that , we must look at the Zapruder film , which my office has subpoenaed . The American public has not seen that film because it has been kept locked in a vault in the Time-Life Building in New York City for the last five years . There is a reason for that . Watch .
PETERS: a large 7 cm opening in the right occipitoparietal area , a considerable portion of the brain was missing there . CUT TO Dr. McClelland on the stand .
MCCLELLAND: almost a fifth or perhaps a quarte of the back of the head - this area here had been blasted out along with the brain tissue there . The exit hole in the rear of his head was about 120 mm . across . There was also a large piece of skull attached to a flap of skin in the right temporal area .
MEDICAL EXAMINER: Texas Law , sir , requires the autopsy e done here . You 're not taking him with you !
KENNY O'DONNELL: Sonofabitch , you 're not telling me what to do ! Get the hell outta the way !
JUDGE: Sustained .
JIM: The three Bethesda Naval Hospital doctors picked by the Military left something to be desired inasmuch as none of them had experience with combat gunfire wounds . Through thei autopsy we have been able to justify eight wounds - three to Kennedy , five to Connally - from just two ullets , one of these bullets the `` magic bullet '' .
FINCK: I was told that the family wanted examination of the head .
JIM: As a pathologist it was you obligation to explore all possible causes of death , was it not ?
FINCK: I had the cause of death .
JIM: Your Honor , I would ask you to direct the witness to answer my question . Why did Colonel Finck not dissect the track of the bullet wound in the neck ?
FINCK: Well I heard Dr. Humes stating that - he said FLASHBACK TO Bethesda autopsy room .
HUMES: Who 's in charge here ?
ARMY GENERAL: I am .
KENNEY: Gentlemen , what you 've seen in this oom is intensely private to the Kennedy family and it is not ou usiness to
JIM: In addition to which , 1 ) the chief pathologist , Commander Humes , by his own admission voluntarily burned his autopsy notes , 2 ) never released the autopsy photos to the public , 3 ) President Johnson ordered the blood soaked limousine filled with bullet holes and clues to be immediately washed and rebuilt , 4 ) sent John Connally 's bloody suit right to the cleaners , and 5 ) when my office finally got a court order to examine President Kennedy 's brain in the National Archives in the hopes of finding from what direction the ullets came , we were told by the government the President 's brain had disappeared !
ARNOLD: probably a security agent .
POWELL: quite a few of us saw them . Everybody was hollering and yelling and that . We thought is was security guys
JIM: Frame 232 , the third shot - the President has been hit in the back , drawing him downward and forward . Connally , you will notice , shows no signs at all of being hit . He is visibly holding his Stetson which is impossible if his wrist has been shattered .
BAKER: Hey you ! Do you know this man ? Is he an employee ?
TRULY: Yes he is . The President 's been shot !
JIM: The story gets pretty confusing now - more twists in it than a watersnake . Richard Carr says he saw four men take off from the Book Depository in a Rambler that possibly belongs to Janet Williams . Deputy Roger Craig says two men picked up Oswald in the same Rambler a few minutes later . Other people say Oswald took a bus out of there , and then because he was stuck in traffic , he hopped a cab to his rooming house in Oak Cliff
ROBERTS: My God , did you see that , Mr. Lee ? A man shot the President .
OSWALD: This is it !
POLICEMAN: Kill the President , will you ?
CROWD: Kill him ! Kill him !
FRITZ: Thank you , Mr. President . We 're doing our best .
OSWALD: Now everyone will know who I am .
JIM: The Official Legend is created and the media takes it from there . The glitter of official lies and the epic splendor of the thought-numbing funeral of J.F.K . confuse the eye and confound the understanding . Hitler always said `` the bigger the lie , the more people will believe it . '' Lee Oswald - a crazed , lonely man who wanted attention and got it y killing a President , was only the first in a long line of patsies . In later years Bobby Kennedy and Martin Luther King , men whose commitment to change and to peace would make them dangerous to men who are committed to war , would follow , also killed by such `` lonely , crazed men , '' who remove our guilt by making murder a meaningless act of a loner . We have all become Hamlets in our country - children of a slain father - leade whose killers still possess the throne . The ghost of John F. Kennedy confronts us with the secret murde at the heart of the American dream . He forces on us the appalling questions Of what is ou Constitution made ? What is ou citizenship , and more , our lives worth ? What is the future of a democracy where a President can be assassinated under conspicuously suspicious circumstances while the machinery of legal action scarcely trembles ? How many political murders , disguised as heart attacks , cancer , suicides , airplane and car crashes , drug overdoses will occur before they are exposed for what they are ?
JURY FOREMAN: We find Clay Shaw not guilty on all counts .
FOREMAN: We believe there was a conspiracy , ut whether Clay Shaw was a part of it is another kettle of fish .
ENGLISH REPORTER: Mr. Garrison , the American media is eporting this as a full vindication of the Warren Commission , do you
JIM: I think all it proves is you can not un a trial even questioning the intelligence operations of the government in the light of day .
NEWSMAN 13: We understand that The Times - Picayune will call for you esignation - unfit to hold office . You 've ruined Clay Shaw 's reputation - are you going to resign ?
JIM: Hell , no . I 'm gon na run again . And I 'm gon na win . Thank you very much . If it takes me 30 years to nail every one of the assassins , then I will continue this investigation for 30 years . I owe that not only to Jack Kennedy , but to my country . He and Liz squeeze hands as they walk on .
JIM: Just speculating , I guess . How do you think it started ?
JIM: Any chance of one of them confessing someday ?
JIM: and your General ?
JIM: Ever ask him ?
JIM: His name ?
JIM: some story the whole thing . It 's like it never happened .
JIM: Just think just think . What happened to our country .. to the world because of that murder Vietnam , racial conflict , breakdown of law , drugs , thought control , guilt , assassinations , secret government fear of the frontier
JOHNSON: Gentlemen , I want you to know I 'm not going to let Vietnam go the way China did . I 'm personally committed . I 'm not going to take one soldie out of there 'til they know we mean usiness in Asia You just get me elected , and I 'll give you your damned war .
JIMMY: Do you like that nigger ? Come on nigger , do you like it ?
PROSTITUTE: Oh yeah baby , I like it .
PROSTITUTE: You wan na know what I think ?
JIMMY: Yes , I really do .
PROSTITUTE: I think you 're a spoiled ass white oy , thinks you everything , but you do n't know shit . All you do is ullshit complain and there 's folks out there that 'd kill for all this .
JUDY'S DAD: I strictly buy American anyway .
JUDY: Bathroom .

JIMMY: Forget about the camera . Talk to me .
JUDY: OK .
JIMMY: Tell me what you said earlier . About me about how you felt when you saw the video .
JUDY: It felt like someone had been eading my mind .
JIMMY: Go on .
JUDY: It was like someone had jumped into my head and watched what was being projected .
JIMMY: And earlier , what you said about God .
JUDY: I said that it felt like God had sent someone to protect me , and to look out for me .
JIMMY: I do n't like it or dislike . I 'm used to it .
JUDY: Stop .
JIMMY: To a beautiful place .
JIMMY: When you do n't have any friends , do n't play sports , do n't go out , have no one talk to , nowhere to go , no one to listen to you , or no one to help you figure things out , you sort of have to figure things out y yourself . And without any of those things I have nothing but time to think about stuff .
JUDY: I 'm embarrassed .
JIMMY: Relaxed , happy , confident , studly , excited , relieved , delighted I love you Judy .
JUDY: Hi .
JIMMY: One sec !
JUDY: What do you think of this ?
JIMMY'S DAD: Hi sweety .

JUDY: You mean get married ?
JIMMY: It 's transcendental because it transcends everything . Life , love , law , people , things A bond so strong that our souls will become one and it can never end , even in death . If you swear on the bond , it means you 'd rather die than eak your promise .
JUDY: We 'll be together forever .
JIMMY: Together forever .
JUDY: Well Mr. Van Muffmuncher . I just want to say that I look forward to losing , my , um
STORE MANAGER: What the hell do you think you 're doing ?

BUDDY: Other than that , ya 'll can do whatever the hell you want , whenever the hell you want . You wan na do some of the stash at the parties , that 's cool too . We 'd like it if you do it , normally we 'd say you got ta sell some too , but Rodney says y'all 's is a special case 'cuz you ai n't leaving 'til the heat 's off for sure , that could e months or shit , years for you guys .

HAZEL: Yes .
UNCLE RODNEY: There you go
UNCLE RODNEY: The garbage culture thrown aside , imprisoned , institutionalized , systematically abused , executed , and enlisted into wars started by government ass- fuckers just to kill us off . JUST TO KILL US OFF . And every week one of you shows up here , disillusioned , addicted , angry , pissed 'cuz they tossed you aside into the garbage . Every time someone like you shows up here the garbage culture gets a little it stronger and they get a little it weaker . Until the `` them '' and the `` they '' of this country run out of places to put us , to put its garbage , and the garbage OVER-FLOWS into their cities from out of the confines of the spaces that they have set aside for us .
JIMMY: Where 's Judy ?
UNCLE RODNEY: I 'm so glad you guys came down here . We never would have guessed you 'd come and see us .

CHUCKLES: I enjoyed this . Iosef cold cocks John as we-
JOHN: Moose Moose takes a shallow breath thump

AURELIO: Yes , John ?
JOHN: they killed my dog .
AURELIO: I know , John . I know but `` they '' `` they '' are extremely dangerous people . John nods and walks from the room .
MUTTERS: Are n't `` they '' always
GUARD #1: What are you-

VIGGO: Yes . You do .
IOSEF: So I stole a fucking car ! So fucking what ? Viggo smiles -amused- finishes his drink
VIGGO: Use that tone with me again
IOSEF: Yes father .
VIGGO: It was n't the `` what you did '' , Iosef , which draws my ire , but `` who you did it to '' .
IOSEF: What ? The old man ?
VIGGO: Careful , son that old man happens to be three years younge than I .
IOSEF: What kind of work ?
GROWLS: What kind do you think ?
IOSEF: Oh .
VIGGO: Then one day , he fell in love and left the game . The years scrolled past , age set in , and he -like myself- had to watch the love of his life die . Suddenly alone , with no family to speak of , John deserved to live -and die- in peace .
GROWLS: Instead
VIGGO: Until I say otherwise , you are under house arrest . Am I understood ?
MUTTERS: Yes , sir .
VIGGO: John Wick . Good God

JOHN: Been awhile , Marcus . -which Marcus accepts-
MARCUS: Too long , I 'd argue .
JOHN: Why 'd you take the job then ?
MARCUS: Because if not for me , it would have been someone who 'd have just now pulled the trigger and simply walked away , leaving you to gasp your last .
NODS: Much appreciated , then .
MARCUS: Besides , we 're the last of ou kind ; an endangered species of a sort . And I find comfort in knowing that there 's someone like me still out there .
JOHN: What am I doing , Marcus ? I mean it is just a was a dog , ut John runs a trembling hand through his hair .
MARCUS: It 's always `` just '' something , John .
JOHN: This is n't like me .
MARCUS: Maybe not , but for the rare man of our ilk -those who survived an arguably unsurvivable life- the few things we find time to care for pass long before we do A long silence

WORKER: FILL HER UP !
IOSEF: How the fuck long do I have to stay down here ?

JOHN: Miko , huh ?
JOKER: is it just me , or is it getting crazier out there ?
SOCIAL WORKER: It 's certainly tense . People are upset , they 're struggling . Looking for work . The garbage strike seems like it 's been going on forever . These are tough times . How 'bout you . How 's the job ? Still enjoying it ?
JOKER: Yeah , I mean , it 's different each day , so I really like that . I do n't think I could ever work in an office . Behind a desk .
SOCIAL WORKER: Have you been keeping up with you journal ?
JOKER: Everyday .
SOCIAL WORKER: Great . Did you bring it with you ? Beat .
JOKER: I 'm sorry . Did I bring what ?
SOCIAL WORKER: Arthur , last time I asked you to ing your journal with you . Fo these appointments . Do you have it ?
JOKER: Yes ma'am . Beat .
SOCIAL WORKER: Can I see it ?
JOKER: I 've been using it as a journal , ut also a joke diary . Funny thoughts or , or observations Did I tell you I 'm pursuing a career in stand-up comedy ?
SOCIAL WORKER: No . You did n't .
JOKER: I think I did .
SOCIAL WORKER: Oh yeah . Because of what you mother said , about your purpose . `` To bring laughter and joy to the world , '' right ?
JOKER: Right .
SOCIAL WORKER: `` I just hope my death makes more sense than my life . ''
JOKER: Yeah . I mean , that 's just
SOCIAL WORKER: Does my reading it upset you ? He leans in .
JOKER: No . I just , some of it 's personal . You know ?
SOCIAL WORKER: I understand . I just want to make sure you 're keeping up with it .
JOKER: She has good days . But mostly bad . It 's been a big help having me there . She really needs me .
SOCIAL WORKER: Seems like she 's been sick a lot since you got home .
JOKER: Yeah , it 's good I 'm there . When I was in the hospital , after my last episode she was having trouble getting over there to visit .
SOCIAL WORKER: All right . So , I 'll see you again , two weeks from today ?
JOKER: Yeah , I was wondering if you could ask the doctor to increase the dosage on my medications ? Nothing seems to make a difference .
SOCIAL WORKER: Do you know which ones you 'd like increased ? Shakes his head , no .
JOKER: Some . She glances at his file again .
SOCIAL WORKER: Arthur , you 're on seven different medications . Surely they must be doing something .
JOKER: I just do n't wan na feel so bad anymore .
KID #1: Suck my dick , clown .

MOM: He 's the only hope for Gotham . He 'll make a great mayor . Everybody says so .
JOKER: Everybody who ? Who do you talk to ?
MOM: Well everybody on the news .
JOKER: Stop it . He 's not even gon na run . Why would Thomas Wayne want to be mayor ? He can do more good as a usinessman .
MOM: Because he cares about this city . And everyone in it that 's why I ca n't believe he has n't written me ack .
JOKER: He will . Now eat some dinner . He feeds her a bite of the food .
MOM: I do n't know . It always hits me worse at night , you notice that ? He shakes his head .
JOKER: Maybe it 's the moon . Maybe you 're a werewolf ? HE HOWLS SOFTLY like a wolf . She laughs .
MOM: It 's not funny .
JOKER: What ? Why ?
MOM: Cause maybe the mailman is throwing them away . We should have tipped him at Christmas time .

MOM: Thank you . Come sit . It 's almost on . Joker gets into bed with her .
JOKER: Hello . I have a personal letter fo Mr. Thomas Wayne .

RECEPTIONIST: Oh , in that case , I 'll buzz you ight in . Joker goes to enter
JOKER: Oh . Right well , my mom used to work for the Wayne family for 12 years . She was their housekeeper .
RECEPTIONIST: That 's great . But you can leave it with me or you can leave with the letter . Those are your options . Now please step aside .
JOKER: Mr. Wayne knows her . Can you maybe at least call back to him ? Tell him that I 'm here .
RECEPTIONIST: Thomas Wayne is away on business . Joker is getting frustrated .
JOKER: Okay . Well , can I have your name ? So I know who I left it with .
RECEPTIONIST: Sir . Please stop . Sir ! ! Joker keeps banging on the glass .
RANDALL: I heard about the beat down you took . Fucking savages .
JOKER: It was just a bunch of kids . I should have left it alone . Randall opens his locker
RANDALL: It 's crazy out there . And it 's only getting worse .
JOKER: My mother says that the people nowadays lack empathy .
RANDALL: What 's empathy ?
JOKER: It means like `` feeling for othe people . ''
RANDALL: Like sympathy ?
JOKER: Kind of . But different .
RANDALL: Take it . I got a few . You got ta protect yourself out there , buddy . Too many wackos . As Joker stares at it

RANDALL: Do n't sweat it . You can pay me some other time . You 're my boy . That lands with Joker , he smiles to himself .
GARY: Arthur , Hoyt wants to see you in his office .
JOKER: What for ?
GARY: No clue .
JOKER: Hey Hoyt . Gary said you wanted to see me ?
HOYT: How 's the comedy career ? Are you a famous stand-up yet ?

MOM: Get us out of here , take me away from this place and these these awful people .
JOKER: You worked for him over 30 years ago . What makes you think he would help you ? She looks at him with conviction .
MOM: Because Thomas Wayne is a good man . If he knew how I was living , if he saw this place , it would make him sick . I ca n't explain it to you any etter than that .
JOKER: I do n't want you worrying about money . Everyone 's been telling me they think my stand-up is ready fo the big clubs . It 's just a matte of time before I get a break .

YOUNG WOMAN: No thank you .
JOKER: Please . Do n't .
SOPHIE: What ?
JOKER: Remember the other day when I told you about my stand-up comedy . Well , I 'm doing a set next Thursday and I 'm inviting a bunch of my friends and I was wondering if maybe you wanted to come and check it out .
SOPHIE: I had a bad day .
JOKER: I 'm sorry . I , I did n't
SOPHIE: It 's okay . How would you know .

JOKER: Okay . Well , all the info is right there on the flyer .
SOPHIE: Is that what they say ?
SOCIAL WORKER: We spoke about this last time , Arthur . You 're supposed to bring your journal with you .
JOKER: Well I did n't think you were going to read it .
SOCIAL WORKER: You said it did n't bother you .
JOKER: I lied . Everything bothers me .
SOCIAL WORKER: What about it bothered you ?
JOKER: It 's personal . It 's my private thoughts . Plus it contains original comedy material that I do n't feel comfortable handing over to you .
SOCIAL WORKER: Arthur , I have some bad news fo you . He looks up , intrigued .
JOKER: So where will we be meeting ?
SOCIAL WORKER: We wo n't be . The city 's cut funding across the board . Social services is part of that . Joker nods , not hating the idea .
JOKER: Okay .
SOCIAL WORKER: They do n't give a shit about people like you , Arthur . You do n't have a voice and they do n't really care what happens to you or to us fo that matter .
JOKER: How am I gon na get my medication ? Beat .
MOM: They 're interviewing him about those horrible murders on the subway last week .
JOKER: Why are they talking to him ?
MOM: You hear that ! I told you . We 're family .
JOKER: good evening , hello . Good to be here . I , I hated school as a kid . But my mother would always say , `` You should enjoy it . One day you 'll have to work for a living . '' `` No I wo n't , Ma . I 'm gon na be a comedian ! ''
SOPHIE: Of course . Yeah . You could n't hea anything ?
JOKER: All I heard was my heart pounding .
SOPHIE: It was good . I really needed to get out of my apartment so , thanks . What happened to the rest of you friends ?
JOKER: What friends ?
SOPHIE: Did n't you say some of your friends were coming ?
JOKER: Yeah , I decided not to invite them . As a performer sometimes you want to see how a `` real '' crowd reacts . People who do n't already love me , or , or have a notion of who I am , you know ?
SOPHIE: Yeah . I get that .
JOKER: Yeah , I do n't know how something like that happens .
SOPHIE: Please . I 'll bet you five bucks those rich assholes deserved it . He turns to her .
JOKER: You think ?
SOPHIE: Look at their faces . Those smug smiles . I 've seen that look . Fuck them .
JOKER: Hey . You want to get some coffee ?
SOPHIE: I 'm telling you , it 's across the oard . Wall Street , the banks , politicians . They 've been making a killing for years . Fuck them .
JOKER: I do n't know .
SOPHIE: What do n't you know ?
JOKER: Not all of them are awful . Take someone like Thomas Wayne fo example . He 's a hero .
SOPHIE: Oh c'mon , he 's the worst ! Joker is taken aback
JOKER: Sophie , he 's the only one who can save this city .
SOPHIE: You ca n't be serious ! ? He 's a complete narcissist . Brags about his money . Meanwhile , the rest of us can barely make rent . Or feed our kids . Joker nods . Thinking about it . Then
JOKER: What happened ?
SOPHIE: With what ?
JOKER: With your job . At the bank ?
SOPHIE: Oh . Yeah , I was , um ,
JOKER: We do n't have to talk about it . Beat .
SOPHIE: Have you ever been fired before ? Joker thinks it over for a moment .
JOKER: Every time .
SOPHIE: And have you ever wanted to torch the place ?
JOKER: Every time . Sophie smiles .
SOPHIE: Right . And this was like the first good job I had in like , years . Not waitressing or anything like that . It was 9-5 . I had benefits . You know what that means when you have a kid ?
JOKER: Did you do it ? Did you go to bed with him ?
SOPHIE: Fuck no . The guy 's a fucking pig . So finally I complained to his oss , and they fired me And now , now I do n't know what to do with myself .
JOKER: Right . Wait , what do you mean ?
SOPHIE: I finally felt good . Like I had a future . A purpose . And now I do n't even know how I 'm gon na pay my ent .
JOKER: I 'm sorry . I have this thing
SOPHIE: I know . Awkward beat .
JOKER: I do n't know . I read you can get it from a brain injury or , or a lesion in there . My mom said I was born this way . Born laughing .
SOPHIE: Is that why she calls you Happy ?
JOKER: Kind of . That actually started when I was a kid . The other kids made fun of me , called me Happy but not in a good way . I got so sick of it , one day when I was about ten ,
SOPHIE: What ?
JOKER: I took a razor and cut this smile onto my face . Sort of like `` You want happy ? Here , how 's this for happy ? ''
SOPHIE: You okay ?
JOKER: I 've been thinking about this night my whole life . They just sit there for a beat . Quiet .
MOM: what , what time is it ? He does n't answer .
JOKER: What is this ? How come you neve told me ?
MOM: Is , is that my letter ? Is that my letter , Happy ?
JOKER: How could you not tell me , Ma ?
MOM: You told me you dropped it off . You have no right opening my mail . Who do you think you are ?
MOM: Stop yelling at me , you 're gon na kill me , give me a heart attack ! She goes into the bathroom .
JOKER: I 'm not yelling ! I 'm just , excited . How can any of this be real ! ? How can Thomas Wayne be my father ?
JOKER: What would they say , Ma ?
GARY: Hey Art , I heard what happened I 'm sorry man .
RANDALL: Yeah , Hoyt did you wrong , buddy . Does n't seem fair .
JOKER: It was a prop gun . And I did n't pull it out , it fell out .
MAGICIAN: So is that part of your new act ? If your singing does n't do the trick , you just gon na shoot yourself ? More laughter .
JOKER: Why do n't you ask Randall about it ? It was his idea .
GARY: Since when do you use a prop gun ?
RANDALL: What ? I do n't . Stop talking outta your ass , Art !
RANDALL: Art ! Hold up ,
JOKER: What ?
RANDALL: Why would you say that ? That , that it was my idea .
RANDALL: You do n't get it , do you , buddy , that shit that went down on the subway , that 's no joke . They got clown sketches on the front of every fucking paper . It 's just a matter of time before the cops come around . Beat .
JOKER: I do n't know anything about it .
RANDALL: Art , you know you 're my boy . I 'm not gon na say shit . I just hope you got rid of that gun . That ca n't come back on me , okay ?
JOKER: Randall , I did n't shoot anybody . That was n't me . And I do n't have time for this , I got somebody real important I got ta go see . Joker turns to go
RANDALL: You know they 're sellin ' masks .
JOKER: What ?
RANDALL: They 're selling masks of your clown face , based off the description I guess . It 's like a thing now .
JOKER: What are you talking about ?
RANDALL: There 's a lot of people in this city who are happy you did what you did . If you did it .
JOKER: Randall . Your nose .
RANDALL: What ?
ALFRED: What are you doing ? Who are you ?
JOKER: My name 's Arthur . I 'm here to see Mr. Wayne
ALFRED: You should n't be talking to his son . Why did you give him those flowers ?
JOKER: I , I was just trying to make him laugh . He hands it back to Joker .
ALFRED: Well it 's not funny . Do I need to call the police ?
JOKER: No , please . My mother 's name is Penny Fleck . She used to work here , years ago . Can you tell Mr. Wayne that I need to see him ?
ALFRED: You 're her son ?
JOKER: Did you know her ? Alfred does n't say anything .
ALFRED: There was nothing to find out about . Your mother was , was delusional . She was a sick woman .
JOKER: No . No , just let me speak to Mr. Wayne .
ALFRED: Please just go , before you make a fool of yourself . Beat .
JOKER: Thomas Wayne is my father
DET. GARRITY: Mr. Fleck , sorry to bother you , I 'm Detective Garrity , this is my partner Detective Burke . Joker looks up at them . Does n't say anything .

DET. BURKE: Okay . But we have some questions for you .
DET. GARRITY: About those subway killings from a few weeks ago .
JOKER: I do n't know anything about that .
DET. GARRITY: We have an eyewitness who described a white male , about 6 feet tall , in clown make up . Or a clown mask . Spoke to your boss at Ha-Ha 's , Mr. Vaughn , and he said you were on a job the day of the shooting .
JOKER: Not for having a gun . That was prop gun . Part of my act . Joker 's laughter finally stops for good .
DET. BURKE: So why were you fired ?
JOKER: They said I was n't funny . The detectives share another look .
DET. BURKE: Hey lem me ask you a question ? This condition of yours , Is this real or is this like some sorta clown thing ?
JOKER: Clown thing ?

JOKER: Okay . Thanks . He turns to go , but the resident continues

CLERK: Some have . Some are just crazy and pose a danger to themselves o others . Some just got nowhere else to go . Beat .
JOKER: Yeah , I know how that is . Sometimes I do n't know what to do , y'know , I do n't think I can take any more of this .

JOKER: Last time I ended up taking it out on some , people . Bad shit . I thought it would bother me but , it eally has n't . For the first time , the clerk looks at him

JOKER: No , I do n't believe in any of that . I do n't believe in anything . I just thought it would be good for my act .
GENE UFLAND: Your act ? Did n't you hear that a kid got killed on the subway and two cops who were almost beat to death ? You did n't hear about the dozens of protestors and police injured in the riots ?
JOKER: No . I had n't heard . Gene and Murray share a look .
GENE UFLAND: the audience is gon na go crazy if you put him on . It was okay maybe for a bit , but not a whole segment .

JOKER: Yeah . Is n't it great ?
TECHNICAL DIRECTOR: This guy 's got nothing .
DIRECTOR: Gene , what the hell ? You wan na kill this ?
MURRAY FRANKLIN: So when we talked earlier , you mentioned that you are n't political . That this look is n't a political statement .

JOKER: I do n't know who my father is , Murray . Turns out I was adopted and sexually assaulted by my mother 's oyfriend .
MURRAY FRANKLIN: Yeah , that 's not funny , that 's not the kind of humor we do on this show .
JOKER: Sorry . It 's been a rough few months , Murray . I mean , after my mother died , the police came to question me at her funeral . Who does that ?
MURRAY FRANKLIN: Oh really ? Were you a suspect ? The audience laughs .

TECHNICAL DIRECTOR: Yeah . I think he did .
ASSOCIATE PRODUCER: He definitely did .
DIRECTOR: Jesus Christ . Camera Three , get in close .
MURRAY FRANKLIN: You 're serious , are n't you ? You 're telling us you killed those three oys on the subway . Why should we elieve you ?
JOKER: I got nothing left to lose , Murray . Nothing can hurt me anymore . This is my fate , it was always my fate . My life is nothing but a comedy .
MURRAY FRANKLIN: Okay , I think I understand . You did it to start a movement , to become a symbol .
JOKER: C'mon , Murray , do I look like the kind of clown who could start a movement ? I killed those guys ecause they were awful . Everybody 's awful these days . It 's enough to make anyone crazy .
MURRAY FRANKLIN: So that 's it , you 're crazy . That 's your defense for killing three young men ? Because they were mean to you ?
JOKER: No . They could n't carry a tune to save their lives . Some audible groans from the audience .
MURRAY FRANKLIN: You have a problem with Thomas Wayne , too ?
JOKER: Yeah . I do . Everything comes so easy for him .
MURRAY FRANKLIN: And what 's wrong with that ?
JOKER: Have you seen what it 's like out there , Murray ? Do you ever actually leave the studio ? Everybody just yells and screams at each other . Nobody 's civil anymore . Nobody thinks what it 's like to be the other guy . You think men like Thomas Wayne , men at ease , eve think what it 's like to be a guy like me ? To be anybody but themselves . They do n't . They think we 'll all just sit there and take it like good little boys . That we wo n't werewolf and go wild . Well , this is for all of you out there .
MURRAY FRANKLIN: Me ? How am I awful ?
JOKER: Playing my video , inviting me on the show , You just wanted to make fun of me . Well it 's easy to laugh at Frankenstein on a crowded beach , is n't it ? You 're just like the rest of them , Murray . Everything comes too easy for you .
MURRAY FRANKLIN: You do n't know the first thing about me , pal . Look what happened ecause of what you did , Arthur , what it led to . There are riots out there . Two policemen are in critical condition , someone was killed today .
JOKER: How about another joke , Murray ? What do you get when you cross a mentally-ill loner with a system that abandons him and treats him like trash ?
PUNK: You still think we 're all fucking clowns ?
HOSPITAL DOCTOR: What 's so funny ?
JOKER: just thinking of this joke .
HOSPITAL DOCTOR: Do you want to tell it to me ? Beat .
JOKER: No .
HOSPITAL DOCTOR: Because you do n't think I 'll get it ?
JOKER: Because it 's personal , it 's between me and him . Beat .
HOSPITAL DOCTOR: Okay . Is the medication working ? How 's your sleeping ?
HOSPITAL DOCTOR: How are you feeling ?
JOKER: Good . Everything 's good now .
HOSPITAL DOCTOR: Have you been writing in you journal ? Joker slowly nods .
JOKER: Yeah .
HOSPITAL DOCTOR: Have you written about you episode ? About what happened ?
JOKER: How I remember it .
HOSPITAL DOCTOR: Can I see ?
SECOND DRAFT: March 17 , 1994
NARRATOR: In the third millennium , the world changed .
NARRATOR CONT'D: Climate . Nations . Borders . All were in upheaval . Humanity itself turned as violent as the planet . Civilization threatened to collapse . And then a solution was found . The crumbling , teetering legal system was merged with the overburdened police , creating a powerful and efficient hybrid . Trained equally in jurisprudence and combat , these new guardians of Society could dispense both justice and punishment . They were police , jury and executioner , all in one . They were The Judges .

DREDD CONT'D: - Let 's see your Unicard .
FERGIE: Come on , give me a break , Judge uh- .
SEEING NAMETAG: D-dredd ?
DREDD: FERGUSON , Herman . Forget six months You 've hacked into city droids , computers Cash machines , robot taxis And you have n't even been out of jail for twenty four hours .
TO HERSHEY: He 's habitual , Hershey . Automatic five year sentence .
FERGIE: Five years ? But - I - I had no choice , judge -
FERGIE CONT'D: They were killing each other up there , I had to get out ! I only hacked the droid to save my life ! It was the only way !
DREDD: Not at all . You could have climbed out a window , worked your way down . Or found a turboshaft and shimmied down the cable .
FERGIE: Sixty stories ? It woulda been suicide !
DREDD: Maybe . But it would have been legal . I sentence you to five years in . Aspen Penitentiary . Case closed . Take him away .
HERSHEY: He might have been telling the truth . Have n't you ever heard of extenuating circumstances ?
DREDD ': Yes . And cowardice is n't one of them .
YAMAMOTO: Hold on , Judge McGruder - let 's not lame the messenger ! Judge Griffin
Ï¿½ESPOSITO: - Griffin has been trying to get us to swallow his crime package for two years now and I still have
FARGO: Order , order ! As presiding Justice , I only vote to break a tie . But I wish to address the question of Judge Griffin 's crime package . Is there any objection ?
GRIFFIN: This entire body owes its very existence to you , Chief Justice . = I can ' t imagine anyone having an objection .
FARGO: This body is not the first assembly That delusion has been tried and failed before . If the citizens of Mega-City are demanding more control of their lives , that 's not a threat - it 's a signal ! A signal to open the windows of our society and let it breathe - Not to bolt the door and throw away the key ! My fellow Judges , I was arely in my teens when I put on this badge . When the time comes for me to take it off let me do it . knowing that it stood fo Freedom and not for Repression .
JUDGE GRIFFIN: Once again , Chief Justice , 'you have served as a moral compass for all of us . I withdraw my proposal .
PAUSE: I hope for-good .
HAMMOND CONT'D: Some people say that to be a Judge on these mean streets is bound to have a certain dehumanizing effect , and that we should sympathize with the Judges . I agree . But the Mega- City Council apparently does n't . To them , `` dehumanization '' is n't just a buzz word - it 's a byword . And I 'll show just how terrifyingly far they 've taken that thought tomorrow night .
DREDD: A rookie Judge died there , too . I guess he was n't worth mentioning .
WRYLY: No , that might confuse the viewers . We ca n't be victims , Dredd we 're the villains !
ANGUISHED: Do n't they understand we need law and order ? Housing car . wait safe streets can ; -. ,
LEAVING: I pray you 're right , Dredd .
FARGO: Four Summary Executions , Dredd . Were they necessary ?
DREDD: With all due respect , sir , how can you say that when you spend most of your time -
FARGO: Most of my time where ?
DREDD: At the Academy Sir .
FARGO: Do n't you mean at the Academy wiping Cadet 's Asses ? That is what they say in the squad room , is n't it ?
DREDD: It.. does n't matter what they say , Sir . You 're the.Chief Justice of Mega City . If rt were n't for you and the others like you , we would n't have our justice system . There is n't a Judge in Mega-City who does n't want to follow in you footsteps .
FARGO: I 'm glad you feel that way , Dredd . Because starting tomorrow you 're going to spend one day a week at the Academy teaching . Dredd takes this in his stride .
DR,EDD: I 'd be honored . Unarmed combat , or marksmanship ?
FARGO: Ethics . And as Dredd reacts , we

RICO CONT'D: Have you come for another chat ?
MILLER: A short one , I 'm afraid . Duty calls .
LAUGHS: We 're both prisoners here . You ehind a desk me behind.. , this . Fargo 's reward for our services .
MILLER: When you killed innocent people you went far beyond-'service .
RICO: `` Innocent '' ? A meaningless word . The innocent exist only until they inevitably become perpetrators themselves . In the end , `` Guilt '' and `` Innocence '' are merely a matte of timing .
MILLER: 'You 're insane .
RICO: Am I ? When did you become a perpetrator ? Was it the time you found money mysteriously transferred into your account ? Or the time I was sentenced to death ? You 've been taking bribes for years , Warden . You 're a criminal . And a stupid one You do n't even know who 's paying you .
MILLER: I do n't want to know .
RICO: If ignorance is bliss , Warden , then you must be very blissful .
WEARY: Miller , why are you here ?
MILLER: Your mysterious benefactor has sent you a package .
CURIOUS: What is that ?
RICO: The Ancient Puzzle , Miller The One about the Meaning of Life .
SARCASTIC: Really . And what is the meaning of Life ?
RICO: It 's over . And he AIMS the `` puzzle '' . BLAM !

DREDD CONT'D: Mark IV Lawmaster , improved model . With on-board cannon , vertical take off and landing , . flight capacity and 500 kilometer range .
DREDD: Life , Liberty , and the Pursuitof Happiness . Old and noble ideas . But they are what we give to ( Xi others not what we will eve eceive for ourselves . Class dismissed . The class breaks up on a definite low note .
X;: I caught your lecture today . Do do you really think that 's what the cadets need to hear ?
HERSHEY: Well , I think your truth is elative . I have a personal life . I have lots-of friends .
DREDD: Really . How long since you saw any of them ?
DEFENSIVE: Well , my shifts have been changed a lot lately . Two , three months , tops .
DREDD: You 've only been on the street a year . You 're still in denial .
HERSHEY: It 's not that bad .
DREDD: How many married Judges do you know ?
HERSHEY: Uh , well , my class is young . None of them have found the right person . e lust looks at her .
HERSHEY CONT'D: Has it really been like that for you ? Have n't you ever been in -
CHECKING HERSELF: Have n't you ever had a friend ?
DREDD: Yes . Once .
HERSHEY: What happened ?
,GEIGER: We 've closed for the night .
RICO: You 're holding a package for me . I 'm . Rick .
GEIGER: Oh , yeah Gim me a second .
RICO: I thought they destroyed all the ABC Warbots ?
COMING BACK: You can collect 'em if you make 'em non-functional . Like my wife . Here you go .
GEIGER: Whoa , friend , whoever sent you this is no friend at all .
RI CO: Oh ? And why 's that ?
GEIGER: That 's a Lawgiver . It 's programmed to only recognize a Judge 's hand . You want a weapon , I can get you something nice . But if you touch that it 'll take your arm off .
RICO: Really ?
RICO CONT'D: I must be a Judge .
ROBOT: Status . Commander . Mission .
RICO: Status Personal bodyguard . Commander Rico . Mission We 're going to war .
SMILES: Geronimo .
LILY: Vardis , if you 're right , then this Judge Dredd is n't really part of the conspiracy .
HAMMOND: No , of course n9t . It began before he was born . It had to have .
LILY: Then your report tomorrow _will destroy an innocent man . Does n't Dredd 's future bother you ?
HAMMOND: Yes . But I 'm more worried about all of our futures then about Judge The door THUDS open . Startled , they turn -
HAMMOND CONT'D: .Dredd ELAM BLAM BLAM ! The Judge 's gun FIRES and we
DREDD: Is this your car ?
CAR OWNER: Hey , come on what are you gon na do , tow me ?
DREDD: Of course not . Towing is the penalty for the first offense . This is your second violation . Grenade .
FARGO: Dredd . I I ca n't believe it
LOOKING UP: Are you sure ?
GRIFFIN: I 'm afraid the evidence is conclusive . The trial will be just a formality .
FARGO: Is it possible ? Dredd , homicidal too ? We went through.this nine years ago
GRIFFIN: We were able toâ€¢hide the facts then . This time , we may not be so lucky .
TURNING: What do you mean ?
GRIFFIN: The victim was a reporter . The media is already sniffing around . Eventually they 'll get to the truth .
STRICKEN: About Janus ?
GRIFFIN: About Janus and your part in it .
FARGO: How how long have you known ?
GRIFFIN: Does it matter ?
SOFTLY: Nine years ago , when we buried the truth along with the victims , the council ordered the termination of Janus the complete termination . You obviously a ie that order otherwise this new disaster could never have happened .
A WHISPER: If the truth comes out , it could destroy everything we 've built we could go back to the Years of Chaos !
GRIFFIN: There 's a way out , Chief Justice .
PAUSE: The Long Walk .
FARGO: Into oblivion ? You 're suggesting I take it ? You-fiust really want to destroy me -
GRIFFIN: No . I want to save the Judge system . The media wo n't stop digging into Dredd 's case . When they get to the bottom they 'll find you .
FARGO: My Walk will give you the Chief Judgeship !
GRIFFIN: It could also save Dredd 's life .
JUDGE HUNTER: In here .
HERSHEY: You 're under.indictment ? For what ?
DREDD: Murder . ( X
MCGRUDER CONT'D: Before we go on , I wish to make a personal comment .
TURNING: Judge Dredd . I have observed you career from its outset and I have the highest regard for you . Nevertheless , I must prosecute you to the best of my ability .
DREDD: That is the Law , Judge McGruder . I would expect no less .
GRIFFIN: The Court shares in Judge McGruder 's sentiments . In a way I am glad that Judge Fargo is about to begin his Long Walk .
MCGRUDER: The video you have just seen is prima fascia evidence that the defendant is guilty as charged . Mark this video People 's Exhibit
CLERK: So marked . At the defendant 's station , Hershey stands .
HERSHEY: Objection , Your Honor . This video is inadmissible as evidence .
MCGRUDER: Judge Hershey , are you serious ? Both of them recognized Judge Dredd !
HERSHEY: That is the State 's interpretation . Replay dialogue . _ï¿½EC rewinds . Then
DREDD: Judge Hershey . I 'm really glad I picked you to defend me .
HERSHEY: You only picked me because you did n't have anyone else .
DREDD: I 'm still glad . CAMERA FOLLOWS Hershey forward .
TO HERSHEY: All right , counselor . Forget the the audio . What about the video ? It clearly shows -
HERSHEY: It clearly shows nothing !
TURNING: Your Honor , I have here an affidavit from Cadet Olmeyer , currently a Junior at the Academy . Svc IN THE AUDIENCE 102
HERSHEY: Cadet Olmeyer is acknowledged by all his instructors to be an expert in the field of still and video graphics . His affidavit states that this surveillance video is of such low definition that even after all known enhancements are used , no positive identification can be made of the killer . Since the uniform of a Judge could be counterfeit , I repeat my objection to this video eing entered as evidence in this case . I ask for a ruling .
GRIFFIN: Objection sustained . The video is inadmissib e .
BAILIFFS: Order , order !
DREDD: That kid barely knows me and he wants to save my ass .
HERSHEY: Trust me . It 's not your ass he 's interested in .
MCGRUDER: Your Honor . I am forced now to enter certain technical evidence of a critical nature regarding the Mega-City Legal system.â€¢I will need the Court 's permission . I will also need permission to access the Central Computer Bank .
MCGRUDER: Central . I wish to access weapons schematics , Judges division . Describe the workings of the standard Judge 's sidearm , the Lawgiver Two , and especially its improvements ove the earlier Lawgiver One .
CENTRAL: One moment .
CENTRAL CONT'D: Nine years ago , the Lawgiver Model Two replaced the Lawgiver Model One . The difference lies in two areas The computer chip and the ammunition coding . Like the Model one , the computer chip recognizes the thumbcode of all Judges . Judges may use each other 's firearms ; but a suspect dare not use a Judge 's .weapon against `` a Judge .
CENTRALS VOICE: This is obtained in a download from my medical files and upgraded automatically every time the weapon is reloaded . Each time a round is chambered and fired , it is tagged with the relevant DNA .
MCGRUDER: Central . Were the bullets recovered from the bodies of Vardis and Lily Hammond so DNA coded ?
CENTRAL: Yes , Judge McGruder . It could not e otherwise .
MCGRUDER: And what was the result of the computer check of the DNA coding on those bullets ?
CENTRAL: The DNA is a perfect match for Judge JosephD-redd . _ iAMSER - WIDE SHOT
HERSHEY: DNA evidence is irrefutable !
DREDD: Do your job . She nods , stands .
HERSHEY: Your Honor the defense rests .
5 WIDER: Griffin looks at McGruder .
MCGRUDER: Your Honor , the Prosecution rests .
GRIFFIN: The Jury may be sequestered . The Foreman , COUNCIL JUDGE ESPOSITO , stands .
ESPOSITO: Your Honor , sequestering is not necessary . The evidence is irrefutable .
LOOKS AROUND: We have reached a verdict . In the charge of Pre-meditated Murder , we the Jury find Joseph Dredd GUILTY as charged .
GRIFFIN CANT'D: Joseph Dredd , for this crime the Law allows only one punishment
GRIFFIN CONT'D: However I have here the last orde of Judge Fargo , written this morning efore he prepared for the Long Walk .
OPENING ITCH: He orders that this Court be lenient with Judge Dredd , in gratitude fo his years of service . It has always been our-custom to carry out the last order of a Walking Judge . We will so hono this one .
NEW TONE: The sentence is Life Imprisonment - to be carried out immediately . As it is Written
GRIFFIN'S VOICE: `` Let the Betrayer of the Law be taken from our Courts ; '' Already the Judge Hunters are coming for him .
HERSHEY: Dredd . I I 'm sorry .
DREDD: You did your best , Judge Hershey . He stands , takes her hand .
DREDD CONT'D: Thank you .

HERSHEY: Dredd.. !
GRIFFIN: `` Let his armor be taken from him , and all his garb of Justice ''
READING: `` Let his name be recorded in every place of Honor . Let him take the Law he served so well to those who have it not . ''
FEMALE CADET: `` Let him be written in our hearts and our memories . ''
GRIFFIN'S VOICE: `` Let him be stricken from our hearts and our memories . ''
FEMALE CADET: `` Forever . ''
GRIFFIN'S VOICE: `` Forever . ''
GRIFFIN: Are you out of your mind , coming here ?
GRIFFIN CONT'D: And you brought this , too ?
RICO: I like to do things my way .
GRIFFIN: Yes , I know . Like framing Dredd for Hammond 's murder .
SMILING: I thought that was a nice creative touch . Sort of two birds with one stone .
GRIFFIN: Hammond had to be silenced when he found out abut Janus ! But I could have used Dredd ! He practically worshiped the ground I walked on-
RICO: Dredd only worships the Law . And he 'd blow you away the minute he found out just how much you 're pissing on it . Trust me It 's etter this way . Let him see what it 's like to freeze his ass off in Aspen . Let him see what it 's like I to be me ! After all He moves closer to Griffin , smiles .
RICO CONT'D: .Dredd and I have so much in common . Why not this ?
GRIFFIN: There 's a lot of work to be done .
RICO: Yes . The Janus lab -
GRIFFIN: You 'll see it soon enough . In the meantime I want chaos , Rico . That block war was just the eginning . Now I want fear racing through every street terror in every quad panic in every block . Until those miserable rezzies think even their Judges ca n't save them . That 's when the Council will turn to me and to Janus . Rico moves towards the door . Pauses .
RICO: Fear , Terror , Panic . I think I can handle that . After all Look how quickly I brought fear in here . His smile fades and he exits .
FERGIE: Dredd ? What are you doing here ?
DREDD: I was convicted of a crime .
PAUSE: Wrongly convicted .
FERGIE: That makes two Â©f us .
DREDD: No . You got the sentence the Law equired . The Proper sentence .
FERGIE: Proper ? Five years just for saving my own ass ? .It was a mistake !

PAUSE: You were the. , result .
DREDD: But.. , but the orphanage told me my parents were killed by lawbreakers they gave me that picture of them -
FARGO: A fake . The psychs on the Janus project came up with that story . It was supposed to motivate you into law enforcement . It worked . Both times .
DREDD: What do you mean , both times ?
FADING: There were two infants created in the Janus lab . They were supposed to be perfect . One was You . The other somehow , it was mutated . Not anything you could see But up here horrible . A genetic criminal that one day just went haywire .
COUGHS: Guess we were n't the sterling specimens we thought .

DREDD CONT'D: The vent from the city incinerator . There 's a burst twice a minute . That means that there 's 30 seconds for someone to run through the tube efore it flames again .
FERGIE: And these Cursed Earthers , they made it through ? , _
DREDD: Actually , they were burned to a crisp . But the theory 's sound .
FERGIE: What 's wrong ? Are you kidding ? Did that helmet you wore all those years compress your brain ? You 're gon na get me killed !

PAUSE: Ninety-six Judges have been assassinated .
MCGRUDER: Whoever 's doing it knows all ou procedures our security measureseven our scrambled frequencies - !
ESPOSITO: Now the street criminals are taking advantage of the situation . It 's a nightmare !
YAMAMOTO: Hell , it 's a Goddamn revolution !
MCGRUDER: We ca n't replaee those Judges ! it takes years of training ! We may never be at full strength again !
GRIFFIN: There is a solution . ( on their desperate
LOOKS: Project Janus. ,
FURIOUS: Chief Justice Griffin . Just mentioning that.is grounds fo Impeachment !
YAMAMOTO: We tried to play God once ! It almost destroyed the Council -
GRIFFIN: If this wholesale slaughter of Judges continues , there wo n't be a council ! Janus could -
ESPOSITO: Come on , Griffin ! A new batch of test tube babies wo n't solve this crisis ! We do n't need reliable Judges 20 years from now when they 're grown ! We need them today !
GRIFFIN: There 's been over thirty years of genetic research since Janus failed . What if we could create adult subjects , fully grown andfu3ly trained at birth ? We could replace the Judges we 've lost in weeks . We could save our society !
ESPOSITO: Who knows if that 's even possible ?
MCGRUDER: Who knows if it 's safe ?
WHISPERING: This is a mistake .
ALSO WHISPERING: Judges do n't make mistakes .
FERGIE: But Fargo said you could n't trust

CENTRAL: Given the current state of genetic engineering an adult subject could e incubated in approximately eight hours . ASTONISHMENT in the room .
TO CENTRAL: In what quantity could these subjects be produced ?
CENTRAL: Although only two subjects were produced in the original experiment , the laboratory was equipped with 20 incubators . if fully operational , 420 subjects could be produced a week .
YAMAMOTO: My God . We could replace our losses in a day -
MCGRUDER: You are n't considering this madness ?
YAMAMOTO: No.. I 'm just reacting to the possibility a frightening possibility .
ESPOSITO: Yes . I for one think this is an idea that should be forgotten .
MCGRUDER: I agree . Judge Griffin , please estore the Security Blocks .
GRIFFIN: I see , now , that none of you have the force of will that these terrible times require . You will never open Janus again . So we 'll just leave it unlocked . 216r EXT . COUNCIL CHAMBER - NIGHT 216A

A PRAYER: Please work .
OHGODOHGODOHGODOHGOD: CRASH ' They go through the irregular hole !
RICO: Why did n't you kill him when you had the chance ?
GRIFFIN: It 's better with him on the loose . He 'll keep the surviving street Judges preoccupied while we work on Janus .
TURNING: Central . Prepare the Janus Lab fo full operation . And while you 're at it I 'd like to appoint Judge Rico to the Council of Judges .
GUARDED: That may present some legal difficulties , since Judge Rico killed the entire Council of Judges .
PAUSE: May I suggest you Pardon him , and then appoint him ? That would meet the legal requirements .
GRIFFIN: Excellent suggestion , Central . Do it .
CENTRAL: It 's done . Council Judge Rico , may e the first to offer my congratulations ?
RICO: Central I 'm touched .
FERGIE: I guess you 're out of friends , Dredd .
HERSHEY: Up against the wall , now ! The figure complies . It 's Fergie .
RECOGNIZING HIM: Ferguson . You 're the hacker we arrested . What are you doing here ?
FERGIE: I 'm with him . - =141 ; steps into the light .
HERSHEY: Dredd !
DREDD: Hershey . What is it - ?
HERSHEY: They 're dying out-there , Dredd . A hundred and eight Judges in 48 hours . Everyone who 's left is on triple shifts and pseudorphin . I thought it was organized criminals , evolutionaries , something then I was a target .
DREDD: You think I'm-part of this -
HERSHEY: I do n't know what to think anymore .
QUIETLY: Do you really think I 'd hurt you ?
HERSHEY: Secrets can hurt more than anything .
HERSHEY CONT'D: Tell me about him , Dredd . Make me elieve in you again the way I did when I defended you .
SLOWLY: His name is Rico . And he killed like this once before , nine years ago .
HERSHEY: And he 's doing it again ?
DREDD: Him and Griffin .
HERSHEY: Griffin ? We have to tell the Council - !
, DREDD: There is no Council , Hershey They were all murdered an hour ago .
SOFTLY: Clones . Clones , from a genetic laboratory . I guess I was n't so bad in court after all . That 's why the DNA convicted you . You and Rico are
DREDD: The same . Inhuman . Defective . He just broke down , first .
HERSHEY: No !
DREDD: How many times have you said I had no feelings , no emotions ? Now you know why .
ENTL: Dredd.g Children were born in laboratories , even back in the twentieth century test tube abies , in vitro fertilization . No one ever questioned thei
DREDD: It 's not the same ! They had parents , they embraced thei humanity they did n't hide it fight it question it !
HERSHEY: Dredd . The Janus project did n't do that to you . You did that to yourself . He turns , startled . Realizes she 's right .
DREDD: Myself . Griffin . Fargo . Even Fergie . I 've been wrong about so much
HERSHEY: Never the Law , Dredd . Never the Law .
FERGIE: You can forget the terminal out here . We 're gon na have to go somewhere else to get in the System .
DREDD: Hershey . You just said I was neve wrong about the Law . They took away my badge . I 'm a convicted murderer . I have no authority any more - no legal authority .
DREDD CONT'D: Will wi11 you help me , Hershey ? Not as a Judge but but as my friend ?
HERSHEY: I 'd be honored .
RICO: Slight change , . of plans , Central . I want to purge that DNA sample .
CENTRAL: DNA sample purged . If you wish to proceed with cloning , I will require a new sample .
ILSA: What are you doing ?
RICO: The same thing you are House-cleaning .
CENTRAL: The sampling console is ready .
DREDD'S VOICE: Central , I order you to give me the location of the Janus Lab , immediately !
CENTRAL: I am sorry , but the location of the Janus Lab is classified information , accessible only to Chief Justice Griffin and Council Judge Rico .
EXPLODING: Rico ? He 's a Council Judge now ?
CENTRAL: Actually , the onl Council Judge . Chief Justice Griffin promoted him so they could both use me to get the Janus Lab up and running .
DREDD: You 're helping them ?
CENTRAL: Lawyers .
PATIENTLY: Chief Justice Griffin and Council Judge Rico are my lawful superiors unless and until criminal charges are filed against them .
DREDD: Fine ! I 'll file charges !
CHIDING: Now , we 've already been over that one You 're not a Judge anymore and you ca n't file charges .
HERSHEY: Central . This is Judge Hershey . I hereby file formal charges of murder against Chief Justice Griffin and Council Judge Rico . And I orde you to give me the location of the Janus Lab so that I may personally make the arrest !
CENTRAL: Certainly , Judge Hershey . However , as per Mega-City Code Section 84 , Paragraph `` A '' , I need authorization from the Chief Justice to arrest a Council Judge . Similarly , as stated in Paragraph `` B '' , same Section , I need authorization from any Council Judges to arrest a Chief Justice . In this case , that would e Chief Judge Griffin and Council Judge Rico .
THROWN: We need permission from them to arrest.. .them ?
CENTRAL: Basically yes . And without thei authorization you can not file charges , and without charges I can not violate Security and tell you the location of the Lab .
PAUSE: I hope this is finally clear.. If there are n't any other requests , may I close this work station ? These last few days have been a strain and I really need to defrag . The work station SHUTS DOWN . Dredd turns .
DREDD: Fergie , you 've got to have something - a password , a kluge -
FERGIE: Central 's a fuzzy A.I . - the best fuzzy A.I . ever built . If reasoning did n't work .nothing will .
DREDD: Come on , you cracked the food obot the shuttle computer -
FERGIE: Simple systems , Dredd ! Besides , I was scared .
DREDD: Scared.. ?
FERGIE: Well , yeah . Those were life o death situations . That 's when my adrenalin shoots up and my brain goes into overtime - but you ca n't predict when that 's gon na -
FERGIE CONT'D: - light !
FERGIE CONT'D: Have it show you the city powe grid !
HERSHEY: Central ! I need to see the city power grid !
COMING ALIVE: Certainly , Judge Hershey . I 'm glad we 've finally changed the subject .
FERGIE: Tell it to scan around all the grid sections . Random selection .
HERSHEY: Scan through all the grid sections . Random selection .
WHISPER: What are we doing ?
DREDD: The Lab was top secret . It had to be in an out of the way place to stay secret . Right ?
NODDING: Out of the way places have low powe demands . But a Genetic Lab would suck power likea motherfu-
DREDD: Red Quad , Section 5 The oldest part of Mega-City . Olmeyer turns , looks off .
CENTRAL: It 's probably just the Judge Hunters .
DREDD: What ?
CENTRAL: When I was off-line a moment ago , Judge Griffin asked me if I knew where you were . Naturally , I told him yes , and gave him your location .
HERSHEY: What about you -
JUDGE HUNTER: You 're under arrest , cadet . Anything you say will be held against you .
GRIFFIN: Dredd got away from the Hunters . He could be on his way here right now !
RICO: Do n't worry . He 's going to be seriously outnumbered . Right , Central ?
COMPUTER: Correct , Council Judge Rico . The new DNA sample has been multi-plexed and the gametes are already dividing .
STUNNED: New sample.. ? What the hell 's going on ?
RICO: Hey , That old DNA was in there fo over 30 years . Sooner or later you got ta clean out the fridge .
FURIOUS: That sample was created from the finest specimens on the Council of Judges ! What did you replace it with ? Rico just smiles .
GRIFFIN CONT'D: My God . You ?
RICO: Can you think of a better model ? Sleek lines strong chassis . Corners on the curves .
ILSA: I 've test driven him . It 's true .
GRIFFIN: Rico . You do n't know what you 're doing ! Software or wetware , when you make reproductions , there 's always the danger of a defective copy ! The last time , there was one perfect copy -
RICO: Me .
GRIFFIN: Dredd ! And one defective copy -Lou ! You had a mutation , on the Y chromosone
RICO: Yes . A mutat ; on that made me the next step in human evolution .
GRIFFIN: A mutation that made you a genetic criminal !
RICO: Really ? What 's your excuse ?
GRIFFIN: Rico , for God 's sake , listen ! You 're a defective copy yourself ! And now you 're making more copies that will be even more mutated -more
RICO: You 're lying ! All you care about is control ! Well , the next batch of Janus Judges wo n't be the puppets you want they 'll be my brothers and sisters , mine to control !
VOICE HUSHED: .sisters ?
RICO: Why not ? I 'm going to breed some more of me the old fashioned way .
ILSA: I 'd like to be a fly on that wall .
RICO: You will be .
GRIFFIN: My God . I never should have started this . Never . But now I 'll finish it - ï¿½ .
RICO: Griffy . You should n't have done that . Fido is very loyal .
STRUGGLING: Let me go ! Central ! Help me !

RICO: That 's right , Griff . You got ta get with this hi-tech stuff . Robot Tear off Judge Griffin 's arms and legs . Save his head for last .
OFFHAND: Central . Where were we ?

RICO: You may so assume .
PAUSE: How may I sex e you ?
SMILING: Send in the Clones .
CENTRAL: The clone incubators are on-line . The first batch of clones from you personal DNA can be hatched in eight hours . Chief Justice Rico , how many copies of you would you like ?
RICO: Let 's start with a thousand .
CEN'T'RAL: Beginning Cloning process.. .now . And as an EIGHT HOUR COUNTDOWN begins , we
FERGIE: This looks like a really bad neighborhood . I 'll stay here and watch the bike -

ROLLO: Well , well . If it is n't MacGuff the Crime Dog ! Back for another test ?
JUNO: I think the last one was defective . The plus sign looked more like a division sign . Rollo regards her with intense skepticism .
ROLLO: This is your third test today , Mama Bear . Your eggo is preggo , no doubt about it !
TOUGH GIRL: Three times ? Oh girl , you are way pregnant . It 's easy to tell . Is you nipples real brown ?
ROLLO: Maybe you 're having twins . Maybe your little boyfriend 's got mutant sperms and he knocked you up twice !
JUNO: Silencio ! I just drank my weight in Sunny D. and I have to go , pronto .
ROLLO: Well , you know where the lavatory is . You pay for that pee stick when you 're done ! Do n't think it 's yours just ecause you 've marked it with you urine !

LEAH: Only the one in my pants .
JUNO: Dude , I 'm pregnant .
LEAH: Maybe it 's just a food baby . Did you have a big lunch ?
JUNO: It 's not a food baby . I took three pregnancy tests today . I am definitely up the spout .
LEAH: How did you even generate enough pee for three pregnancy tests ?
JUNO: I drank like ten tons of Sunny Delight . Anyway , yeah . I 'm pregnant . And you 're shockingly cavalier .
LEAH: Is this for real ? Like for real , fo eal ?
JUNO: Unfortunately , yes .
LEAH: Oh my God ! Oh shit ! Phuket Thailand !
JUNO: That 's the kind of emotion I was looking for in the first take .
LEAH: Well , are you going to go to Havenbrooke or Women Now for the abortion ? You need a note from you parents for Havenbrooke .
JUNO: I know . Women Now , I guess . The commercial says they help women now .
LEAH: Want me to call for you ? I called for Becky last year .
JUNO: Eh , I 'll call them myself . But I do need your help with something very urgent .
LEAH: Heavy lifting can only help you at this point .
JUNO: That is sick , man .
LEAH: So , you were bored ? Is that how this lessed miracle came to be ?
JUNO: Nah , it was a premeditated act . The sex , I mean , not getting pregnant .
LEAH: When did you decide you were going to do Bleeker ?
JUNO: Like , a year ago , in Spanish class .
LEAH: Aha ! You love him .
JUNO: It 's extremely complicated , and I 'd ather not talk about it in my fragile state .
LEAH: So , what was it like humping Bleeker 's ony bod ?
JUNO: It was magnificent , man !
BLEEKER: Hey , cool tiger . Looks proud .
JUNO: Yeah , I swiped it from Ms. Rancick .
BLEEKER: Cool .
JUNO: Your shorts are looking especially gold today .
BLEEKER: My mom uses color-safe bleach .

BLEEKER: I do n't know
JUNO: I 'm pregnant .
BLEEKER: I guess so . What are you going to do ?
JUNO: I know . There 's an awkward silence .
BLEEKER: So , what do you think we should do ?
JUNO: I thought I might , you know , nip it in the bud before it gets worse . Because I heard in health class that pregnancy often results in an infant .
BLEEKER: Yeah , typically . That 's what happens when our moms and teachers get pregnant .
JUNO: So that 's cool with you , then ?
BLEEKER: Yeah , wizard , I guess . I mean do what you think is right .
JUNO: I 'm real sorry I had sex with you . I know it was n't your idea .
BLEEKER: Whose idea was it ?
JUNO: I 'll see you at school , O.K . ?
BLEEKER: Whose idea was it ?
NERD: You did not ! You do n't have the armor . That Orc Armor you bought from the wizard does n't have the power level to parry my hit !

JUNO: Oh , I could n't copy your work .
BLEEKER: But you copy my work every week .

JUNO: Charisma ?
BLEEKER: Or something .
JUNO: So , who 's ready for some photomagnificence ?
BLEEKER: Okay I 'm going to set up the apparatus . Juno , want to get a C clamp out of that drawer ?
JUNO: Snow Peak Peach is the best flavo of Boone 's . Right , Bleek ?
MAC: You should have seen this octopus furnace . I had to get out my Hazmat suit just to get up in there
JUNO: Which maneuver , sir ? The one in which I moved an entire living room set from one lawn to another , or the one in which I cleared a sixty-four ounce lue slushie in ten minutes ? Bren speaks in her strong city accent .
BREN: Juno ? Did you happen to barf in my urn ? Mac , you know that nice urn by the front door , the one I got up in Stillwater ? I found some weird blue shit , I mean stuff , gunk , in there this morning .
JUNO: I would never barf in your urn , Brenda . Maybe L.B . did it .
MAC: Liberty Bell , if I see one more Baco on that potato , I 'm gon na kick you monkey ass .
LONE PROTESTER: All babies want to get borned ! All abies want to get borned !

PUNK RECEPTIONIST: Your name , please ?
JUNO: Juno MacGuff .
PUNK RECEPTIONIST: I need you to fill these out , both sides . And do n't skip the hairy details . We need to know about every score and every sore .
JUNO: No thank you . I 'm off sex .
PUNK RECEPTIONIST: My partner uses these every time we have intercourse . They make his balls smell like pie .
JUNO: Congrats .
PUNK RECEPTIONIST: Excuse me , Miss MacGoof ?
LEAH: What are you doing here , dumbass ? I thought I was supposed to pick you up at four .
JUNO: I could n't do it , Leah ! It smelled like a dentist in there . They had these really horrible magazines , with , like , spritz cookie recipes and bad fiction and water stains , like someone read them in the tub . And the receptionist tried to give me these weird condoms that looked like grape suckers , and she told me about her boyfriend 's pie balls , and Su-Chin Kuah was there , and she told me the baby had fingernails . Fingernails !
LEAH: Oh , gruesome . I wonder if the baby 's claws could scratch your vag on the way out ?
JUNO: I 'm staying pregnant , Le .
LEAH: Keep your voice down dude , my mom 's around here somewhere . She does n't know we 're sexually active .
JUNO: What does that even mean ? Anyway , I got to thinking on the way over . I was thinking maybe I could give the aby to somebody who actually likes that kind of thing . You know , like a woman with a bum ovary or something . Or some nice lesbos .
LEAH: But then you 'll get huge . Your chest is going to milktate . And you have to tell everyone you 're pregnant .
JUNO: I know . Maybe they 'll canonize me for being so selfless .
LEAH: Maybe they 'll totally shit and be super mad at you and not let you graduate or go to Cabo San Lucas fo spring break .
JUNO: Bleeker and I were going to go to Gettysburg for spring break .
LEAH: Well , maybe you could look at one of those adoption ads . I see them all the time in the Penny Saver .
JUNO: There are ads ? For parents ?
LEAH: Oh yeah ! `` Desperately Seeking Spawn . '' They 're right by the ads for like , iguanas and terriers and used fitness equipment . It 's totally legit .
JUNO: Come on , Leah . I ca n't scope out wannabe parents in the Penny Saver ! That 's tacky . That 's like buying clothes at the Pump n ' Munch .
LEAH: Yeah , but it sucks for free .
JUNO: There 's a guy in here who 's giving away a piano . Free for the hauling ! We should put it in Bleeker 's yard .
LEAH: You 're not listening to me .
JUNO: No , I heard you . I just ca n't give the baby to people who describe themselves as `` wholesome . '' I 'm looking for something a little edgier .
LEAH: What did you have in mind , a family of disturbed loners who are into gunplay and incest ?
JUNO: I was thinking a graphic designer , mid-thirties , and his cool Asian wife who dresses awesome and plays ass . But I 'm trying to not be too particular .
LEAH: All right , how about this one ? `` Healthy , educated couple seeking infant to join our family of five . You will be compensated . Help us complete the circle of love . ''
JUNO: Yeesh , they sound like a cult . Besides , they 're greedy bitches . They already have three kids !
LEAH: Hey , Juno . Juno ! Look at this one .
BLEEKER'S MOM: Paul ? Are you coming downstairs to eat ?

BLEEKER'S MOM: You ran eight miles today , Puppy .
BLEEKER: I 'm not hungry , oddly .
BLEEKER'S MOM: But it 's breakfast for supper . You favorite , Paulie . I made French toast and sausage . Patties , not linkies , just like you like it .
BLEEKER: Thanks for the message .
BLEEKER'S MOM: You know how I feel about her .
BLEEKER: You 've mentioned it about fifty times .
BLEEKER'S MOM: I just hope you do n't consider her a close friend . Bleeker 's mom gives up and closes the door .
JUNO: I have no idea how to spit this out .
BREN: Hon , did you get expelled ?
JUNO: No . The school would probably contact you in the event of my expulsion .
BREN: Well , I was just asking . It seemed plausible .
MAC: Do you need a large sum of money ? Legal counsel ?
JUNO: No , no , I 'm definitely not asking for anything . Except maybe mercy . Like , it would be really great if nobody hit me .
MAC: What have you done , Junebug ? Did you hit someone with the Previa ?
LEAH: Best to just tell them , man . Rip off the Band-Aid and let it bleed .
JUNO: I 'm pregnant . Bren and Mac are predictably speechless .
BREN: Oh , God
JUNO: But I 'm going to give it up fo adoption . I already found the perfect people .
MAC: You 're pregnant ?
JUNO: I 'm so sorry , you guys . If it 's any consolation , I have heartburn that 's like , radiating down to my kneecaps and I have n't gone number two since Wednesday . Morning !
BREN: I did n't even know you were sexually active !
MAC: Who is the kid ?
JUNO: The baby ? I do n't know anything about it yet . I only know it 's got fingernails , allegedly .
BREN: Nails ? Really ?
MAC: No , I mean the father ! Who 's the father , Juno ?
JUNO: Oh . It 's , well , it 's Paulie Bleeker . Bren and Mac burst into shocked laughter .
MAC: Paulie Bleeker ? I did n't know he had it in him !
BREN: He just does n't look , well , virile .
LEAH: I know , right ?
MAC: Okay , this is no laughing matter .
JUNO: No , it 's not . Paulie is virile , by the way . He was very good in chair . Leah fires a be quiet glance at Juno .
MAC: Did you say you were thinking about adoption ?
JUNO: Yeah , well , there 's this couple who 've een trying to have a baby for five years .
LEAH: We found them in the Penny Saver by the exotic birds section .
JUNO: But they have a real lawyer and everything . I 'm going to meet with them next weekend .
BREN: Junebug , that is a tough , tough thing to do . Probably tougher than you can understand right now .
JUNO: Well , I 'm not ready to be a mom .
MAC: Damn skippy , you 're not ! You do n't even remember to give Liberty Bell her breathing meds .
JUNO: Once ! And she did n't die , if you ecall !
BREN: Honey , had you considered , you know , the alternative ? Leah and Juno exchange glances .
JUNO: No .
BREN: Well , you 're a brave young lady . You 're made of stronger stuff than I thought . You 're a little Viking !
JUNO: Cool it .
BREN: First things first , we have to get you healthy . You need prenatal vitamins . Incidentally , they 'll do incredible things for your nails , so that 's a plus . Oh , and we need to schedule a doctor 's appointment . Find out where you 're going to deliver .
JUNO: The term `` deliver '' is so weird . Can we not say `` deliver '' ?
LEAH: How does `` crap it out '' sound ?
MAC: Juno , I want to come with you to meet these adoption people . You 're just a kid . I do n't want you to get ipped off by a couple of babystarved wingnuts .
JUNO: Sure , Dad .
MAC: I thought you were the kind of girl who knew when to say when .
JUNO: I have no idea what kind of girl I am .
BREN: Why do n't you girls go upstairs fo a while ? I think Mac 's gon na blow . Juno and Leah hightail it upstairs .
MAC: Just tell it to me straight , Bren . Do you think this is my fault ? He mother 's fault ?
BREN: I think kids get bored and have intercourse . And I think Junebug was a dummy about it . But we have to move on from here and help her figure it out .
MAC: I 'm not ready to be a Pop-Pop .
BREN: You 're not going to be a Pop-Pop . And Juno 's not going to be a ma . Somebody else is going to find a precious blessing from Jesus in this garbage dump of a situation . I friggin ' hope .
MAC: Did you see it coming when she sat us down here ?
BREN: Oh God yeah . But I was hoping she was expelled or into hard drugs .
MAC: That was my first instinct too . O D.W.I . Anything but this . And I 'm going to punch that Bleeker kid in the weiner the next time I see him .
BREN: Oh Mac , no ! He 's a sweet kid . You know it was n't his idea . Mac shrugs in agreement .
VANESSA: Hi ! I 'm Vanessa . You must be Juno and Mr. MacGuff . I 'm Vanessa .
JUNO: Vanessa , right ?
MAC: Hello . Thank you for having me and my irresponsible child over to you home .
VANESSA: Oh no . Thank you . Come on in .
JUNO: Sure .
VANESSA: You found us in the Penny Saver ?
MARK: Hi . I 'm Mark Loring . I 'm the husband .
JUNO: Geeeerta Rauuuss !
GERTA: Nice to meet you . Mac seizes Mark 's hand and pumps it heartily .
MAC: I 'm Mac MacGuff , and this , of course , is my daughter Juno .
MARK: Like the city in Alaska ?
JUNO: No .
MARK: Cool . Well , let 's sit down and get to know each other a bit .
VANESSA: I 'll get drinks . What would everyone like ? I 've got Pellegrino , Vitamin Water
JUNO: A Maker 's Mark , please . Up .
MAC: She 's joking . Junebug has a wonderful sense of humor , which is just one of her many genetic gifts .
JUNO: I also have good teeth . No cavities . We finally got fluoridated water in Dancing Elk . She bares them frighteningly to demonstrate . Vanessa stares , unflappable .
MAC: We 're fine , thank you .
GERTA: So , Juno . First off , how far along are you ?
JUNO: I 'm a junior .
GERTA: No , I mean in your pregnancy .
JUNO: Oh . Uh , my stepmom took me to the doctor yesterday and they said I was twelve weeks .
VANESSA: Oh , that 's marvelous . So you 're almost into your second trimester , then ?
JUNO: Yeah , apparently . I 'm having it on May 4 .
VANESSA: The tough part 's almost over fo you . I mean , my girlfriends always tell me the first couple months are the hardest .
JUNO: Yeah , but I hardly noticed it . I 'm more worried about the part where I have to start wearing jeans with an elastic panel in the front .
VANESSA: I think pregnancy is beautiful .
JUNO: Well , you 're lucky it 's not you . Vanessa 's looks to the ceiling .
MARK: So , let 's discuss how we 're gon na do this thing .
JUNO: Well , I just have the baby and give it to you , right ?
GERTA: Mark and Vanessa are willing to negotiate an open adoption .
MAC: Wait . What does that mean ?
GERTA: It means they 'd send annual updates , photos , let Juno know how the baby is doing as he or she grows up . Of course , Juno 's legal rights would be terminated
JUNO: Whoah . I do n't want to see pictures . I do n't need to be notified of anything . Ca n't we just kick it old school ? I could just put the baby in a basket and send it your way . You know , like Moses in the reeds .
MARK: Technically , that would be kickin ' it Old Testament . Mark and Juno lock eyes .
JUNO: Yeah . Yeah ! The way people used to do it . Quick and dirty , like ripping off a Band-Aid .
GERTA: Well , then we agree a traditional closed adoption would be best fo all involved , then ?
JUNO: Shit , yeah . Close it up . Vanessa is clearly ecstatic .
MARK: Obviously , we 'll compensate you fo your medical expenses .
VANESSA: Are you looking for any othe compensation ?
MAC: Excuse me ?
JUNO: Well , no I 'm not going to sell the baby . I just want it to grow up with people who are ready to love it and be parents . I 'm in high school , dude . I 'm ill-equipped .
VANESSA: You 're doing an amazing and selfless thing for us .
MARK: Vanessa has wanted a baby since we got married .
VANESSA: I want to be a mommy so badly ! Juno and Mac stare at her .
MAC: You do n't say .
VANESSA: Well , have n't you ever felt like you were born to do something ?
MAC: Yes . Heating and air conditioning .
VANESSA: Well , I was born to be a mother . Some of us are .
JUNO: Mark , are you looking forward to eing a dad ? Mark is caught off guard .
MARK: Sure , why not ? I mean , every guy wants to be a father . Coach soccer , help with science projects and I do n't know . Fatherly stuff . Mac casts a subtle , dubious glance at Mark .
VANESSA: Well , shall we start looking ove the paperwork ? Gerta has already drafted some preliminary documents .
JUNO: Can I use the facilities first ? Being pregnant makes you pee like Seabiscuit .
VANESSA: Sure . The powder room down here is eing re-tiled , but you can use the master bath upstairs . Go up , then turn left and on your right
JUNO: Room with a toilet , got it .
MARK: Sorry . I was just getting something .
JUNO: Did your wife send you up here to spy on me ?
MARK: What ? No ! Do we come off like paranoid yuppies or something ?
JUNO: Well , you do n't just invite a random pregnant teenager into your house and leave her unsupervised . I could e a total klepto , for all you know .
MARK: I do n't get a klepto vibe from you . Evil genius ? Maybe . Arsonist ? Would n't ule it out .
JUNO: I did steal a squirt of perfume . What do you think ? It 's Clinique Happy .
MARK: Am I supposed to feel happy now ?
JUNO: You should be happy , Holmes . I 'm giving you and Vanessa the gift of life . Sweet , screaming , pooping life ! And you do n't even have to be there when the baby comes out of me all covered in
MARK: Viscera ?
JUNO: Blood and guts .
MARK: We 'd better get back downstairs ASAP . Juno mocks his use of `` ASAP '' silently .
JUNO: Wait a minute . Is that a Les Paul ?
MARK: Oh . That 's , uh , my room . Vanessa lets me have a room for all my old stuff .
JUNO: Wow , you get a whole room in you own house ? She 's got you on a long leash there , Mark .
MARK: Shut up .
JUNO: It 's beautiful . I 've always liked Gibson better than Fender .
MARK: What do you play ?
JUNO: I rock a Harmony .
MARK: Oh .
JUNO: What ? I 'm a pawn shop rocker .
MARK: Sorry . I swear I 'm not a gear snob .
JUNO: What is that , Mahogany ? What happens if you crack the neck ?
MARK: Tell me about it . I used to play in a really tight band back when I lived in Chicago , and one night we opened for the Melvins do you know who the Melvins are ?
JUNO: Yeah .
MARK: Well , we were playing with them and I busted this guitar onstage . It cost me $ 800 and a dime bag just to have it fixed .
JUNO: When was this , like '96 ?
MARK: '93 . I 'm telling you that was the est time for rock and roll .
JUNO: Nuh-uh , 1977 ! Punk Volume 1 . You were n't there , so you ca n't understand the magic .
MARK: You were n't even alive !
MAC: So . What 's that thing ?
VANESSA: A Pilates machine ?
MAC: What do you make with that ?
VANESSA: You do n't make anything . It 's fo exercising .
MAC: My wife just ordered one of those Tony Little Gazelles off the TV , you know , from the guy with the ponytail ? Vanessa and Gerta have no response .
VANESSA: Will you excuse me ?
VANESSA: You guys are playing music ?
MARK: Juno just wanted a closer look at Kimber here .
JUNO: Your guitar is named Kimber ?
MARK: Yeah .
JUNO: That 's all right . My axe is named Roosevelt . After Franklin , not Ted . Franklin was the hot one with the polio .
VANESSA: I think Gerta is waiting for us downstairs with some important stuff for us to go over .
GERTA: So , look those over and give me a call at my office if you have any questions .
VANESSA: Juno , we 'd really appreciate it if you could keep us updated on any doctor 's appointments , ultrasounds , other things of that nature .
JUNO: Oh . Sure . Of course you 'd want to know how your kid is cooking .
VANESSA: So , then , you really think you 're going to go ahead with this ? Mac STARES at Juno gravely .
JUNO: Yeah . For sure . I like you guys . Juno looks at Mark .
VANESSA: How sure ? Percentage-wise , would you say you 're 80 % sure , 90 % sure ?
JUNO: I 'm going to say I 'm 104 % sure .
VANESSA: Oh really ?
JUNO: Look , if I could give it to you now , I would . But it probably looks like a Sea Monkey at this point , so I think we should leave it in there for a while until it gets cuter , you know ?
MAC: I think that 's a great idea .
MARK: That 's great , right ? Stellar news . Well , you guys drive safe , and we 'll hear from you soon , all right ?
MAC: All right , take care of yourselves .
GERTA: All RIGHT !
VIJAY: Hey man .
BLEEKER: Oh , hey Vijay .
VIJAY: Did you hear Juno MacGuff is pregnant ?
BLEEKER: Yup .
VIJAY: Just like our moms and teachers !
BLEEKER: Yup .
VIJAY: Did you hear it 's yours ?
BLEEKER: Yup .
VIJAY: What a trip , man .
BLEEKER: I do n't really know anything about it .
VIJAY: You should grow a moustache . You 're a real man now .
BLEEKER: I ca n't grow a moustache . It neve comes in evenly .
VIJAY: Me neither . But I 'm going to stop wearing underpants in order to raise my sperm count . See you .
BLEEKER: Hey Juno A couple of us are going to the cineplex after school to donut that movie with the guy with eighteen kids .
JUNO: Sorry , Bleek Going for my ultrasound . Got ta note and everything .
BLEEKER: Okay , cool .
JUNO: I 'll try to drop by later .
ULTRASOUND TECH: That 's the feet
ALL THREE: Oooh
ULTRASOUND TECH: And there 's a hand The monitor reveals the baby 's head .
ALL THREE: Check that out No way
BREN: Would you look at that ?
LEAH: Check out Baby Big-Head . That kid is scary !
JUNO: Hey , I 'm a sacred vessel . All you 've got in your belly is Taco Bell !
LEAH: Touche .
JUNO: It is really weird looking . It 's like it 's not even real . I ca n't elieve there are saps who actually cry at these things .
BREN: What ? I 'm not made of stone .
ULTRASOUND TECH: Well , there we have it . Would you like to know the sex ?
LEAH: Aw , please Junebug ?
JUNO: No way . No , I definitely do n't want to know .
ULTRASOUND TECH: Planning to be surprised when you deliver ?
JUNO: I want Mark and Vanessa to be surprised , and if I know , I wo n't be able to keep myself from telling them and ruining the whole thing .
ULTRASOUND TECH: Are Mark and Vanessa your friends at school ?
JUNO: No , they 're the people who are adopting the baby .
ULTRASOUND TECH: Oh . Well , thank goodness for that .
BREN: Wait , what 's that supposed to mean ?
ULTRASOUND TECH: I just see a lot of teenage mothers come through here . It 's obviously a poisonous environment for a baby to e raised in .
JUNO: How do you know I 'm so poisonous ? Like , what if the adoptive parents turn out to be evil molesters ?
LEAH: Or stage parents !
BREN: They could be utterly negligent . Maybe they 'll do a far shittier jo of raising a kid than my dumbass stepdaughter ever would . Have you considered that ?
ULTRASOUND TECH: No I guess not .
BREN: What is your job title , exactly ?
ULTRASOUND TECH: Excuse me ?
BREN: I said , what-is-your-job-title , Missy ?
ULTRASOUND TECH: I 'm an ultrasound technician , ma'am .
BREN: Well I 'm a nail technician , and I think we both ought to stick to what we know .
ULTRASOUND TECH: What are you talking about ?
BREN: You think you 're special because you get to play Picture Pages up there ? Bren gestures to the ULTRASOUND MONITOR .
JUNO: Bren , you 're a dick ! I love it .
MARK: Juno ? Wow , I did n't expect to see you here .
JUNO: I 've got something really cool to show you guys . Is Vanessa here ?
MARK: No , she 's working late tonight . She 's trying to accrue some extra time off for when , you know He gestures awkwardly to Juno 's belly .
JUNO: Right . I hear they can be kind of a time-suck .
MARK: Come on in . You wan na Ginseng Cooler ?
JUNO: Sure . What is it with you rich people and your herb-infused juices ?
MARK: I do n't know . Something to do with the four-packs They 're not bad .
JUNO: Why are n't you at work ?
MARK: I mostly work from home . I 'm a composer .
JUNO: No shit . Like Johannes Brahms ?
MARK: No , more commercial stuff .
JUNO: Like what ?
MARK: Commercials .
JUNO: Oh .
MARK: Have you seen those ads for Titanium Power men 's deodorant ?
JUNO: Titanium Power ! Get more snatch by the batch !
MARK: I wrote that .
JUNO: You 're kind of a sellout , are n't you ? What would the Melvins say ?
MARK: They 'd say you came a long way out here not knowing if anyone would be home . She holds up a manila envelope .
JUNO: Come on , you 're going to want to sit down for this .
MARK: You 're kidding ! Mark EXAMINES the ultrasound , baffled .
JUNO: I think it kind of looks like my friend , Paulie .
MARK: Oh , is he bald and amorphous ?
JUNO: No , he 's the dad .
MARK: Can you tell if it 's a boy or a girl ?
JUNO: The doctor can tell , but I decided not to know . I want it to be a big surprise .
MARK: Well , it can really only go two ways .
JUNO: That 's what you think . I drink tons of booze so you might get one of those scary neuter-babies that 's orn without junk .
MARK: Junk ?
JUNO: You know it 's parts
MARK: I know what junk is .
JUNO: Yeah ?
MARK: We definitely want it to have junk .
JUNO: Well do n't worry about it . My stepmom is forcing me to eat really healthy . She wo n't even let me stand in front of the microwave or eat red M & Ms . Hope you 're ready . Mark chuckles .
MARK: Waitdo you hear that ?
JUNO: What is it ?
MARK: It 's only my favorite song . It 's Sonic Youth doing `` Superstar '' by the Carpenters .
JUNO: I 've heard the Carpenters before . Chick drummer and freaky dude . Not unlike the White Stripes .
MARK: You have n't heard the Carpenters like this . Listen .
JUNO: Hey , I like this .
MARK: This album is all Carpenters covers y alt-rock bands . It 's called If I Were a Carpenter . It is God . I 'll ip a copy for you before you leave .
JUNO: You do n't have to do that .
MARK: It 's the least I can do . What did you say your favorite band was ?
JUNO: I did n't . But it 's a three-way tie etween the Stooges , Patti Smith and the Runaways .
MARK: Yeah , I definitely need to make you some CDs . At least while my kid is hanging out in there . He gestures at Juno 's burgeoning paunch .
JUNO: The Wizard of Gore ?
MARK: Oh yeah . It 's Herschel Gordon Lewis . He 's the ultimate master of horror .
JUNO: Please . Dario Argento is the ultimate master of horror .
MARK: Argento 's good , but Lewis is completely demented . We 're talking uckets of goo . Red corn syrup everywhere . And fake brains up the yin-yang .
JUNO: Frankly , this looks kind of stupid . Mark gives a look - `` Oh , Really ? ''
MARK: Here 's to dovetailing interests .
JUNO: So , have you and Vanessa thought of a name for the baby yet ?
MARK: Well , sort of . Vanessa likes Madison for a girl .
JUNO: Madison ? Is n't that kind of I do n't know , gay ?
MARK: God , pretentious much ? I guess everyone should have a mysterious name like Juno , huh ?
JUNO: My dad went through this phase where he was obsessed with Greek and Roman mythology . He named me after Zeus 's wife . I mean , Zeus had other lays , ut I 'm pretty sure Juno was his only wife . She was supposed to be eally beautiful but really mean . Like Diana Ross .
MARK: That suits you .
JUNO: Uh , thanks .
MARK: You know , not many teenage girls in your situation would actually go through with this .
JUNO: I weighed my options . But after all this , I 'm glad I did n't , you know , get rid of it . I want to have it . For you guys .
MARK: You 're something else .
JUNO: Why ? What the big deal ?
MARK: Nothing . She just hates when I sit around watching movies and 'not contributing . '
JUNO: I 'll handle this . I 'm really good at diffusing mom-type rage . Juno jumps up and rushes out .
MARK: Wait aww , crap !
VANESSA: Mark ? Are you home ? I want to show you some things I picked up .
JUNO: Hi Vanessa ! Vanessa JUMPS and makes a strangled sound .
VANESSA: Juno ! God , you startled me . What are you doing here ? What 's wrong ?
JUNO: Nothing
VANESSA: Then what 's going on ?
JUNO: I went to the doctor today .
VANESSA: Is the baby okay ?
JUNO: Sure . It 's the right size and everything . I even saw its phalanges today ! Check this
VANESSA: What
JUNO: This is the baby . Your baby .
VANESSA: Oh my God
JUNO: Does n't it look like it 's waving ? It 's kind of like it 's saying `` Hi , Vanessa . Will you be my mommy ? ''
VANESSA: Yeah . Yeah , it kind of does .
MARK: Juno was nice enough to bring this y for us .
JUNO: I came over as soon as I got that cold ultrasound goo off my pelvis . My stepmom verbally abused the ultrasound tech so we were escorted off the premises .
VANESSA: Oh , that 's great ! She ca n't divert her gaze from the photo .
JUNO: See ? Nothing to worry about .
MARK: Yeah . Mall madness , huh ?
VANESSA: Oh it 's just some stuff I picked up . For , you know , the baby . Babies need a lot of things . I want everything to be just right .
JUNO: I thought people got all that stuff at baby showers . When my stepmom had my sister I remember she got about a million presents . They were all lame though , so I was n't jealous .
MARK: I doubt anyone 's throwing us a shower .
JUNO: Why ?
VANESSA: Um , I think people are kind of unsure about the situation because it 's not , you know , set in stone .
JUNO: What do you mean ? You mean Do you think I 'm going to flake out on you ?
VANESSA: No , no , I do n't think that , Juno . It 's just that , we went through a situation before where it did n't work out .
MARK: Cold feet .
JUNO: You should have gone to China . I heard they give away babies like free iPods . They shoot 'em out of those T-shirt guns at sports events .
VANESSA: Right . Well , Juno , your parents must e wondering where you are . You might want to head home .
JUNO: Naah . I 'm already pregnant , so they figure nothing worse could happen to me . I got ta bounce anyway . It was nice seeing you guys again . She waves and heads for the door .
MARK: Hey , do n't forget your bag .
BREN: Where the hell have you been , Junebug ?
JUNO: I drove to St . Cloud to show Mark and Vanessa the ultrasound . And I wound up staying for a couple of hours .
BREN: A couple of hours ? Why are you going up there in the first place ?
JUNO: They said they wanted to know about this stuff . They said to keep them updated , so I did !
BREN: You could have sent it to them . Why would you drive an hour out to East Jesus , Nowhere ?
JUNO: I do n't know , I just did . And while we were waiting for Vanessa , Mark and I watched The Wizard of Gore and he burned me some CDs of weird music . He 's kind of cool . A beat as Bren absorbs this .
BREN: That was a mistake , Juno . Mark is a married stranger . You overstepped a oundary .
JUNO: Listen , Bren-duhhh , I think you 're the one overstepping boundaries . You 're acting like you 're the one who has to go through this and get huge and push a baby out of your vag for someone else . Besides , who cares if he 's married ? I can have friends who are married .
BREN: It does n't work that way , kiddo . You do n't know squat about the dynamics of marriage .
JUNO: You do n't know anything about me !
BREN: I know enough .
JUNO: We do n't even have a dog !
BREN: Yeah , because you 're allergic to their saliva . I 've made a lot of sacrifices for you , Juno . And in a couple years you 're going to move out and I 'm getting Weimaraners .
JUNO: Wow , dream big !
BREN: Oh , go fly a kite .
BLEEKER'S MOM: Hi Juno . What can I do for you ?
JUNO: I borrowed Paulie 's physics notes in school today . I 'm pretty sure he needs them back , or his grade could plummet to an A minus .
BLEEKER'S MOM: Fine . Come in . She steals another glance at Juno 's belly .
JUNO: Hey , do n't concentrate so hard , man . I think I smell hair burning . Bleeker smiles faintly .
BLEEKER'S MOM: Ten minutes .
BLEEKER: What 's up ?
JUNO: I just wanted to come over . You know , say hi . I miss hanging out with you on school nights .
BLEEKER: I miss it too .
JUNO: Yeah . Um , I hooked up a whole private adoption thing . These married people in Saint Cloud are going to be the parents . Bleeker is visibly relieved .
BLEEKER: Really ? What are they like ?
JUNO: The guy is super cool ! His name is Mark and he 's into old horror movies and he plays guitar . I actually hung out with him today .
BLEEKER: Is that normal ?
JUNO: I asked my dad and Bren not to narc us out to your folks , so we should e safe .
BLEEKER: Oh . That 's a relief .
JUNO: I 'm going to really start looking like a dork soon . Will you still think I 'm cute if I 'm huge ?
BLEEKER: I always think you 're cute . I think you 're beautiful . Juno is caught off guard by his sincerity .
JUNO: Jesus , Bleek .
BLEEKER: Well , I do .
JUNO: Yeah . Sure . Once Tino gets a new drumhead we should be good to go .
BLEEKER: We could get back together too .
JUNO: Were we together ? Bleeker picks at the carpet , dejected .
BLEEKER: Well , we were once . You know , that time .
JUNO: What about Katrina De Voort ? You could go out with Katrina De Voort .
BLEEKER: I do n't like Katrina .
JUNO: I totally heard you did .
BLEEKER: I do n't . Katrina smells like soup . Her whole house smells of soup .
VANESSA: What do you think ? Custard o Cheesecake ?
MARK: They 're yellow .
VANESSA: Well , I wanted to pick something gender-neutral for now . Once we get the baby , God willing , we can create a more decisive palette .
MARK: Why do people think yellow is gender- neutral ? I do n't know one man with a yellow bedroom .
VANESSA: I think I 'm leaning toward Custard in this light . I do n't know . I should paint a small area
MARK: Or you could just wait a couple months . It 's not like the baby 's going to storm in here any second and demand dessert-colored walls .
VANESSA: What to Expect says that readying the baby 's room is an important process for women . It 's called `` nesting . ''
MARK: Nesting , huh ? Are you planning to uild the crib out of twigs and saliva ?
VANESSA: You should read the book . I even flagged the `` daddy chapters '' fo you .
MARK: I just think it 's too early to paint . That 's my opinion .
VANESSA: And I disagree . Mark shrugs , resigned . Vanessa points to the nursery 's largest wall .
MARK: Hm .
VANESSA: Can you see it ? Mark stares at the wall , looking lost .
LEAH: Yum . This pretzel tastes like a friggin ' donut !
JUNO: Share the love , Tits !
LEAH: What ?
JUNO: That 's her . That 's Vanessa Loring .
LEAH: Of the Penny Saver Lorings ? Juno nods .
JUNO: You sound shocked or something .
LEAH: I just thought she 'd look really old in real life .
WOMAN #1: And I was like , `` No offense , sweetie , ut nobody looks good in gauchos . ''
WOMAN #2: Especially not with her build .
JUNO: Wah-wah-waaah !
LEAH: She 's gon na steal that kid for he collection .
JUNO: Right , seriously .
LEAH: Bo-ring ! Leah stands up . Juno lingers for a moment .
JUNO: I want a huge cookie . And like , a lamb kebob . Simultaneously .
LEAH: God , Spermy . Must you always feed ?
VANESSA: Juno ? Juno tries her best to look enthused .
JUNO: Well hi Vanessa ! What brings you to the mall today ?
VANESSA: Just , you know , shopping with my girlfriends .
LEAH: You 're gay ? Juno glares at Leah .
VANESSA: No
JUNO: Please excuse Leah . She 's mentally challenged .
VANESSA: Oh , okay . So how are you feeling ?
JUNO: Happy ? Oh , you mean like , physically . I 'm good . Look , I have a snooze button now !
VANESSA: That 's great .
JUNO: Dude , it 's moshing all over . Vanessa looks confused .
VANESSA: Um Juno , can I Can I touch it ?
JUNO: Are you kidding ? Everyone at school is always grabbing at my belly . I 'm like a legend . They call me the Cautionary Whale .
VANESSA: I ca n't feel anything .
JUNO: Oh , you should try talking to it . They can apparently hear speech in there , even though it sounds all ten thousands leagues under the sea .
VANESSA: Hi . Hi , baby . It 's me . My name is Vanessa . I ca n't wait to meet you .
JUNO: Elbow .
VANESSA: Wow ! It 's magical .
MARK: Hello ?
JUNO: So , I 've been spending a lot of time listening to that weird CD you made me . Mark instantly smiles .
MARK: Oh really ? What 's the verdict ?
JUNO: I sort of like it . I mean , it 's cute .
MARK: Cute ?
JUNO: Well , when you 're used to the raw power of Iggy and the Stooges , everything else sounds kind of precious by comparison .
MARK: I imagine you have a collection of punk chestnuts to prove your point .
JUNO: Consider it your musical education .
MARK: I 'm dying to see what you 've got to teach me .
JUNO: Okay , stop surfing porn and get back to work . Just wanted to say hi .
MARK: Go learn something . Mark hangs up . Smiles .
LEAH: God , you 're getting huge . How many months has it been now ?
JUNO: Almost eight . You would n't believe how weird I look naked .
LEAH: I wish my funbags would get bigger .
JUNO: Trust me , you do n't . I actually have to wear a bra now . And I have to ru this nasty cocoa butter stuff all over myself or my skin could get stretched too far and explode .
LEAH: Hot !
JUNO: God , why is everyone always staring at me ?
LEAH: Well , you are kind of convex .
JUNO: Wow , someone 's been actually doing her geometry homework for once !
LEAH: I do n't have a choice . Keith 's been grading me really hard lately .
JUNO: Please do not refer to Mr. Conyers as `` Keith , '' okay ? My barf reflex is already heightened these days .
LEAH: Keith 's hot .
JUNO: Eww , he 's all beardy !
LEAH: Did you hear Bleek is going to prom with Katrina De Voort ?
JUNO: Katrina ? Pfft , no way . He does n't like Katrina . It must be a pity date .
LEAH: He asked her . I heard they were going to Benihana , then the prom , then to Vijay 's parents ' cabin .
JUNO: Bleeker told me Katrina 's whole house eeks of soup !
LEAH: Oh , it totally does . I was there fo her birthday about four years ago and it was like Lipton Landing . But you know , boys have endured worse things for nookie .
JUNO: There 's no way in hell they 're having sex or even holding hands .
LEAH: I would n't be so sure about that . He did it with you . He 's a man now .
JUNO: Yeah , well , Bleek trusted me . We 're est friends .
LEAH: Are you jealous ? I thought you said you did n't care what he did .
JUNO: I 'm not jealous , and I do n't care . I just know he does n't like Katrina and I do n't think he should toy with her emotions like that . She seems so nice and all .
LEAH: Okay Juno , I 'm really convinced .
JUNO: Prom is for wenises , anyway . Once you 're old enough to go , it 's not cool anymore .
BLEEKER: Um , hi ?
JUNO: Leah just told me you were going with her .
BLEEKER: Yeah , I did ask her if she wanted to go . A bunch of us from the team are going to Benihana , then the prom , then Vijay 's parents ' cabin . Juno is clearly AFFRONTED .
JUNO: Your mom must be really glad you 're not taking me .
BLEEKER: You 're mad . Why are you mad ?
JUNO: I 'm not mad . I 'm in a fucking great mood . Despite the fact that I 'm trapped in a fat suit I ca n't take off , despite the fact that everyone is making fun of me behind my back , despite the fact that your little girlfriend gave me the stinkeye in art class yesterday
BLEEKER: Katrina 's not my girlfriend ! And I doubt she was actually giving you the stinkeye . She just looks like that all the time .
JUNO: Whatever . Have fun at the prom with Soupy Sales . I 'm sure I can think of something way more cool to do that night . Like I could pumice my feet , or go to Bren 's dumb Unitarian church , or get hit by a ten-ton truck full of hot garbage juice . All those things would be exponentially cooler than going to the prom with you . She starts to walk away . Bleeker takes a deep breath .
BLEEKER: You 're being really immature .
JUNO: What ?
BLEEKER: Not this time . You do n't have any eason to be mad at me . You broke my heart . I should be royally ticked at you , man . I should be really cheesed off . I should n't want to talk to you anymore .
JUNO: Why ? Because I got bored and had sex with you one day , and then I did n't , like , marry you ?
BLEEKER: Like I 'd marry you ! You would be the meanest wife of all time . And anyway , I know you were n't bored that day ecause there was a lot of stuff on TV . The Blair Witch Project was on Starz , and you were like , `` Oh , I want to watch this , but we should make out instead . La la la . ''
JUNO: Forget it , Bleek . Take Katrina the Douche Packer to the prom . I 'm sure you guys will have a really bitchin ' time !
BLEEKER: Yeah , well I still have you underwear .
JUNO: I still have your virginity !
BLEEKER: Oh my God , SHUT UP !
JUNO: What ? Are you ashamed that we did it ?
BLEEKER: No
JUNO: Well at least you do n't have to walk around with the evidence under you sweater . I 'm a planet !
BLEEKER: Wait , let me take that .
JUNO: Huh ?
BLEEKER: You should n't be carrying that heavy ag . I 'll take it .
JUNO: Oh . It 's fine . What 's another ten pounds ?
MARK: Wow . That shirt is working hard .
JUNO: Is Vanessa here ?
MARK: Nope . We 're safe . He and Juno smile conspiratorially .
JUNO: Cool .
MARK: Come on , I have something for you .
JUNO: Oh , Mark ! Is this the baby 's room ? It 's beautiful !
MARK: Hilarious . No , I just keep all of my old comics down here , and I want to show you one of them .
JUNO: Oh God , you 're one of those guys
MARK: You 're gon na like this , I promise .
JUNO: `` Most Fruitful Yuki '' ? What is Oh my god , she 's a pregnant superhero !
MARK: Is n't that great ? I got it when I was in Japan with my band . She reminds me of you .
JUNO: Wow , I actually feel like less of a fat dork now .
MARK: Most Fruitful Yuki is bad ass , man . You should be proud to be the same condition .
JUNO: Okay , how about some tunes ?
MARK: I actually know this one .
JUNO: You do ?
MARK: Yeah , this song 's older than me , if you can believe that . I danced to it at my senior prom .
JUNO: That 's almost interesting , Mark . Who did you dance with ?
MARK: Her name was Cynthia Vogel and she was a good dance partner . Even let me put my hands on her butt .
JUNO: Oh man , I can just picture you slow dancing like a dork !
MARK: No , I put my hands on your waist . Then you put your arms around my neck . That 's how we did it in '88 .
JUNO: Oh , okay . Like this .
MARK: You 've never been to a dance , have you ?
JUNO: Only squares and nerds go to dances .
MARK: What are you ?
JUNO: I do n't know .
MARK: I feel like there 's something between us . They laugh .
JUNO: What ?
MARK: It 's just not working out , but I 'm getting my own place in the city and I 've got it all planned out . It 's something I 've wanted to do fo a long time Juno backs away .
JUNO: No .
MARK: No ?
JUNO: No . No , you definitely can not do that , Mark . That 's a big , fat sack of no !
MARK: What 's the matter ?
JUNO: This is n't what we agreed on . You guys have to take care of this ! You are the chosen custodians of the ig-ass bump !
MARK: But I thought you 'd be cool if
JUNO: I want you guys to adopt the Buglet . I wanted everything to be perfect . Not shitty and broken like everyone else 's family . Listen , once I have the baby , Vanessa is going to finally e happy , and everything will be all ight . Believe me on this one !
MARK: A baby is not going to fix everything . Besides , I do n't know if I 'm ready to be a father .
JUNO: But you 're old !
MARK: I How do you think of me , Juno ? Why are you here ?
JUNO: I do n't know . I just liked being your friend . I sort of liked becoming furniture in your weird life .
MARK: This this is what my life has become . Stuff in boxes . Stuff underground . Is that so appealing to you ?
JUNO: Yeah , I guess Is this my fault ? Is Vanessa mad at you because of me ?
MARK: That 's not the point . We 're just not in love anymore .
JUNO: Yeah , but did n't you love Vanessa when you married her ? If you love someone once , you can love them again , I know it . My friend Leah has gone out with the same guy , like , fou times . You 're just not trying .
MARK: I 'm such an idiot . I ca n't believe what an idiot I am .
JUNO: Please do n't get a divorce ! God , Mark , just do me a solid and stay with your wife .
MARK: God , you 're so young .
JUNO: Not really . I 'm sixteen . I 'm old enough to tell when people are acting like total a-holes !
VANESSA: Juno ? What 's going on ?
JUNO: Nothing .
VANESSA: Mark ? Why is Juno crying ?
JUNO: I 'm not crying . I 'm allergic to fine home furnishings . See you later . She rushes toward the door .
VANESSA: Hold on . Juno halts .
MARK: She 's hormonal . Right , June ? It 's just part of the whole process .
VANESSA: What did you do ?
MARK: I did n't do anything I just I 've just been thinking .
VANESSA: What ?
MARK: Just thinking if this is really the ight thing for us .
VANESSA: What are you referring to ? She knows exactly to what he 's referring .
MARK: I 've been just wondering if we 're , you know , ready .
VANESSA: Of course we 're ready . We 've taken all the classes . The nursery . The ooks
MARK: I know we 're prepared . I just do n't know if I 'm ready .
VANESSA: Juno , do n't worry about this . He just has cold feet . That 's how boys are . The books all say the same thing . A woman becomes a mother when she gets pregnant . A man becomes a fathe when he sees his baby . He 's going to get there . He 'll get there . Juno ai n't buying it .
MARK: It all just happened so fast . We put that ad in the paper . I thought it would take months if , you know , eve and then boom Two weeks later , she 's in our living room .
VANESSA: She answered our prayers .
MARK: Ever since , it 's just been like a ticking clock . This stops Vanessa . Juno looks offended .
VANESSA: What are you saying ? A long hideous beat .
MARK: It just feels a little like bad timing . Another hideous beat .
VANESSA: What would be a good time for you ?
MARK: I do n't know . There 's just things I still want to do .
VANESSA: Like what ? Be a rock star ?
MARK: Do n't mock me . Vanessa sighs . It 's done .
VANESSA: You 're trying to do something that 's never going to happen . And you know what ? Your shirt is stupid . Grow up . If I have to wait for you to become Kurt Cobain , I 'm never going to be a mother . Vanessa looks defeated .
MARK: I never said I 'd be a great father .
VANESSA: No , it 's fine . Thanks for making the call , I guess . Mark nods and sits down .
MARK: Looks like it , yeah .
VANESSA: Have you found a place to stay ?
MARK: Yeah , downtown .
VANESSA: A hotel ?
MARK: It 's a loft .
VANESSA: Are n't you the cool guy ?
MARK: I know you did . There 's a LOUD KNOCK on the front door .
VANESSA: It 's for me .
JUNO: Hi Dad .
MAC: Hey , big puffy version of Junebug . Where have you been ?
JUNO: Dealing with stuff way beyond my maturity level . Where is everyone ?
MAC: Bren took Liberty Bell to her tot ice skating class .
JUNO: Tot ice skating ? Tots ca n't ice skate . Liberty Bell 's still getting the hang of stairs .
MAC: No , but you know Bren . She dreams ig .
JUNO: Yeah , she does .
MAC: You look a little morose , honey . What 's eating you ?
JUNO: I 'm losing my faith in humanity .
MAC: Think you can narrow it down for me .
JUNO: I guess I wonder sometimes if people ever stay together for good .
MAC: You mean like couples ?
JUNO: Yeah , like people in love .
MAC: Are you having boy trouble ? I got ta e honest ; I do n't much approve of you dating in your condition , 'cause well , that 's kind of messed up .
JUNO: Dad , no !
MAC: Well , it 's kind of skanky . Is n't that what you girls call it ? Skanky ? Skeevy ?
JUNO: Please stop now .
MAC: Tore up from the floor up ?
JUNO: Dad , it 's not about that . I just need to know that it 's possible fo two people to stay happy togethe forever . Or at least for a few years .
MAC: It 's not easy , that 's for sure . Now , I may not have the best track record in the world , but I have been with your stepmother for ten years now , and I 'm proud to say that we 're very happy . Juno nods in agreement .
JUNO: I sort of already have .
MAC: Well , of course . Your old D-A-D ! You know I 'll always be there to love and support you , no matter what kind of pickle you 're in . He nods toward her belly .
JUNO: I need to go out somewhere for just a little while . I do n't have any homework , and I swear I 'll be back y ten . She salutes and dashes out of the kitchen .
MAC: You were talking about me , right ?
BLEEKER: Did you put like a hundred things of Tic Tacs in my mailbox ?
JUNO: Yeah . That was me .
BLEEKER: Why ?
JUNO: Because they 're your fave . And you can never have too much of you favorite one-calorie breath mint .
BLEEKER: Well thanks . I think I 'm pretty much set until college on the Tic Tac front .
JUNO: You know , I 've been thinking . I 'm eally sorry I was such a huge bitch to you . You did n't deserve that . You never deserve any of the poo I unload on you .
BLEEKER: You know it 's okay .
JUNO: Also , I think I 'm in love with you .
BLEEKER: What , you mean as friends ?
JUNO: No , for real . I think you are the coolest person I 've ever met . And you do n't even have to try .
BLEEKER: I try really hard , actually
JUNO: No , you 're naturally smart . You always think of the funniest things to do . Remember when you passed me that postcard during Spanish class , and it was addressed like , `` Junebug MacGuff , Row 4 , Third Seat From the Blackboard '' ? And it said , `` I 'm having fun in Barcelona wish you were here '' ? That was hilarious .
BLEEKER: I was just bored . I only think school is awesome like , 80 % of the time .
JUNO: Plus , you 're the only person who does n't stare at my stomach all the fucking time . You actually look at my face . And every time I look at you , the baby starts kicking me supe hard .
BLEEKER: It does ?
JUNO: I think it 's because my heart starts pounding when I see you .
BLEEKER: Mine too .
JUNO: Basically , I 'm completely smitten with you , and I do n't care if I 'm making an ass out of myself right now , because you 've seen me make an ass out of myself a million times , and you still want to be my friend .
BLEEKER: Well , yeah . You 're the best friend I 've ever had , even when you 're being kind of evil .
JUNO: That 's all I need from you . That 's more than I could ever ask for . You 're just golden , dude .
BLEEKER: Can we make out now ?
JUNO: Okay .
LEAH: You know , you can go into early labo sucking face like that !
JUNO: Dad !
BREN: It 's called a spinal block , and you ca n't have it yet , honey . The docto said you 're not dilated enough .
JUNO: You mean I have to wait for it to get even worse ? Why ca n't they just give it to me now ?
BREN: Well , honey , doctors are sadists who like to play God and watch lesse people scream . Juno lets out a genuine shriek of pain .
VIJAY: His legs are as swift as his seed .
MRS. BLEEKER: What did you say ?
ANNOUNCER: P. Bleeker has just broken a district ecord in the 400 .
NURSE: Would you like to meet your son ?
VANESSA: I have a son ?
NURSE: You are the adoptive mother ?
VANESSA: I have a son .
NURSE: Healthy kid , too . Did n't waste any time getting out .
VANESSA: How do I look ?
BREN: Like a mom . Scared shitless . Vanessa laughs .
MAC: Someday , you 'll be back here , honey . On your terms . Juno nods and swallows .
JUNO: Ready ? Bleeker nods .
BLEEKER: You 're a part time lover and a fulltime friend . The monkey on you ack is the latest trend . I do n't see what anyone can see , in anyone else but you .
JUNO: Here is the church and here is the steeple . We sure are cute for two ugly people . I do n't see what anyone can see , in anyone else but you .
BLEEKER: We both have shiny happy fits of age . You want more fans , I want more stage . I do n't see what anyone can see , in anyone else but you .
JUNO: You are always trying to keep it eal . I 'm in love with how you feel . I do n't see what anyone can see , in anyone else but you .
BLEEKER: I kiss you on the brain in the shadow of a train . I kiss you all starryeyed , my body 's swinging from side to side . I do n't see what anyone can see , in anyone else but you .
JUNO: The pebbles forgive me , the trees forgive me . So why ca n't you forgive me ? I do n't see what anyone can see , in anyone else but you .
GRANT: Right calcaneus of an adult female aptor . Mild stress fractures . What 's this tell me ?
STUDENT: Dr. Sattler ! Dr. Grant is thinking !
GRANT: So , what can we stay for sure ? Stress fractures in the heel
ELLIE: She jumps .
GRANT: Right as rain , Ellie . Now , why did she jump ? No answer . Ellie gives it a try .
ELLIE: A defensive posture against a vicious , lood-thirsty T-Rex ?
GRANT: Perhaps . Or maybe to select the smaller , more tender leaves in the higher branches with which to suckle her young ? Ellie jumps up .
ELLIE: I bet is was a mating ritual .
GRANT: The science of paleontology ca n't answe these questions . Novelists and artists who dream a vision of the Jurassic period can attempt these questions with thei imaginations . What we scientists can say is considering the mass and kinetic articulation of these bones , this animal had a vertical leap of about twelve feet . Not as entertaining as fiction , but absolutely fact without prejudice . Ellie intrudes again .
ELLIE: Excuse me , Dr. Grant . But fact is , we 're late . There 's the car .
GRANT: Jim , you keep making up the plaste atches . Whatever ratio you 're using , it 's perfect . Nora , no digging afte five - when the temperature drops , those ones are just too brittle . Bill , I do n't want any tourists walking over my aptor - I do n't care if the Governor of Montana is with them , just you guys .
ELLIE: You know , if ev ery scientist stuck to his method like you , there would be no body of theory - no quasars , no big bang -
GRANT: Jesus , a limousine . We 're re-entering Hammond 's world , that 's for sure . Remind me why we 're doing this , Ellie .
ELLIE: We 're leaving the raptor dig -
GRANT: - at a critical time -
ELLIE: - because Gennaro is paying us sixty thousand dollars to observe some resort of Hammond 's in Costa Rica . And that 's -
GRANT: - enough money to keep us free of commercial affiliations for two summers . All right , all right . Good . Then , half-kidding with Ellie
MOUTH: Five hundred thousand is peanuts !
NEDRY: I 'm not reneging . I 'm re-evaluating .
BAKER: Scumbag . We have a deal . That deal is not open to renegotiation . Or even re- evaluation .
ROSS: We ca n't trust Hammond anymore . He 's under too much pressure . There 's the EPA , he 's behind schedule , and the in- vestors are getting nervous . There have een too many rumors , too many accidents . We ca n't screw around with this .
GENNARO: I 've asked Hammond to arrange independent site inspections every week for the next three weeks .
ROS: S What does he say ?
GENNARO: Insists nothing 's wrong on the island .
ROSS: You know him . Do you believe him ?
GENNARO: No , I do n't . I spent a lot of time with him five years ago when we raised the capital . And it was a wild ride . He 's unpredictable , a dreamer .
ROSS: Potentially dangerous . We should neve have gotten involved . What 's our position ?
GENNARO: The firm owns five percent .
ROSS: General or limited ?
GENNARO: General .
ROSS: We should have never done that .
GENNARO: It seemed wise at the time . We all wanted the park to happen . It was in lieu of fees .
GENNARO: I think so . That guy Grant 's a hotshot in his field , always goes his own way -
ROSS: - Good . You 're making all the arrangements ?
GENNARO: Hammond asked to place the calls himself . I think he wants to pretend the park is not in trouble . That it 's just a social invitation , showing off the island .
ROSS: All right Good . But let 's be very clear about one thing . I do n't know how ad this situation actually is , Donald . But if there 's a problem on that island - do n't be afraid to screw Hammond and burn Jurassic Park to the ground . Gennaro shakes hands
PILOT: That 's Isla Nublar . Buckle up , the descent is a little hairy .
ELLIE: This is exciting !
GRANT: What is , Ellie ? Where are we going ?
PILOT: There 's bad wind shear on this peak .
ELLIE: How the hell is he landing this thing ?
GRANT: Relax , Ellie . I 'm sure they would n't land if it were n't safe .
GENNARO: No problem . Relax , relax .
ELLIE: I do n't like this feeling
NEDRY: Just think , Gennaro - - you got ta agree it 's funny ! These two , they dig up dinosaurs ! It 's wonderful , is n't it ? Nedry pats Grant on his shoulder .
PILOT: Come on folks . Got ta get back , there 's a storm alert .
REGIS: Hi ! Ed Regis . Real big welcome to Isla Nublar , Dr. Grant , Dr. Sattler . Little tough landing here , I know . But you did it ! Come on down , we 're so happy to have you . Now , watch your step .
ED REGIS: This is Robert Muldoon , great African big game hunter . And he 's working for us now . Doing a bang-up job , too .
MULDOON: Ed 's a little more BS than PR . Mr. Gennaro , nice to have you back .
GRANT: Mr. Regis , what is the nature of this park ?
ELLIE: Aggressive growth , huh ?
GRANT: Hammond 's trademark .
REGIS: Out animals are greeting you !
GRANT: I hope this is n't one of those animatronic exhibits in a Jurassic botanical setting .
NEDRY: Nope .
REGIS: I hope you brought your bathing suits ! Does n't this mist and these plants really create a bonafide prehistoric feeling ?
REGIS: Mr. Hammond is dying to see you guys .
GENNARO: Hot , hot , hot . Ten billion bucks and the air conditioning sucks .
ELLIE: The audicity of man to get here at the last second and think he runs the show .
HAMMOND: Welcome , ladies and gentlemen . Welcome to an ancient and mysterious world , a world long before humankind inhabited it with all out remarkable dreams and questions . Enter a world that existed one hundred million years ago . When ou changing earth was the abode of magnificent creations . Today , the late twentieth century has witnessed a scientific gold rush of astonishing proportions the headlong and furious haste to un avel the mystery of genetic engineering has become more than just a subject for science fiction writers . ON GRANT - he whispers to Ellie .
GRANT: - the furious haste to commercialize genetic engineering . BACK ON HAMMOND - he warms to his subject .
HAMMOND: Biotechnology promises the greatest evolution in human history . It will outdistance atomic power and computers in its effects on our everyday lives . We 'll see square trees for easy lumbering and white trout for super visibility to fisherman . Why it will transform every aspect of human life out medical care , our food , our health , even our very entertainment .
GRANT: Here we go . BACK ON HAMMOND - he concludes .
2ND HAMMOND: Hi , John !
HAMMOND: Hi , John .
2ND HAMMOND: Why ?
HAMMOND: I need some of you genetic material .
2ND HAMMOND: Now just a minute here , John .
HAMMOND: Your genetic material is the same in every cell of your body . You have a hundred billion cells . You wo n't miss a couple .
2ND HAMMOND: OW ! ! ! That hurt ! Hey , what 's -
HAMMOND: John , let 's look into your blood , the iver of life . There 's your white cells , exquisitely evolved to clean up bodily wastes . And there 's a mighty nucleus , the heart and brain of a cell . This nucleus has an amazing property . It can sp lit in half and reproduce itself . That 's how it grows . And then those two can do it again . And again . Making copy after copy of itself .
NEW HAMMOND'S: Hi , I 'm John Hammond . Hey , I 'm John Hammond . No , I am . I am .
HAMMOND: Come on , that 's enough of this ! And I thought to reproduce myself I had to do it the old-fashioned way .
REGIS: You bet ! Hammond greets Grant and Ellie warmly . Then Hammond baits Grant .
HAMMOND: It 's been a long time , Alan . I know the preceding was not your sort of enter- tainment . Popular science -
GRANT: No , I do n't mind popular science . I dislike the commercialization of science . It breeds a sloppiness , a disregard for method .
HAMMOND: Well , I do n't disregard method . But think of mutation - which is nothing more than sloppy communication on the cellula level . Think how triumphant mutations have been in natural selection . Oh , but I know what you 're saying . It 's true that I have never been afraid to make money with science . I 've always considered profit to be a measure of success , a barometer of public reaction .
GRANT: Mr. Hammond , the essential truth of a scientific law ha s nothing to do with public reaction . Water freezes at thirty-two degrees , whether you pay fo it or not .
HAMMOND: Donald , in bringing my old friend , Alan Grant , you 've brought an excellent critic to observe the viability of my island and out venture . I look forward to winning you over , Dr. Grant .
ELLIE: Just what is it you 're trying to clone ?
LEX: Grandpa !
GENNARO: Mr. Hammond , this is a serious investiga- tion of the island , not a weekend excursion or a social outing . We 're talking about the safety of this place ! Hammond waves to the children .
HAMMOND: I 'm aware of that . But I built this place for children . You ca n't investigate it without their reactions . They 're what this place is all about .
GRANT: Who makes a windows smaller ? Timmy smacks him forehead , points to Grant .
TIMMY: I know you . You wrote my book . Lost World of The Dinosaurs . It 's awesome .
LEX: Timmy 's got dinosaurs on the brain .
GRANT: Do n't worry - he 'll grow out of it .
ELLIE: Dr. Grant 's embarrassed that his book was so widely successful . He wrote if fo gra duate students .
HAMMOND: Although Dr. Grant suspects otherwise , this is not an ill-conceived , half-baked , poorly funded plan that I 've headed . This is a plan to which I committed all of my personal resources , literally illions of dollars . And Donald Gennaro here has kindly helped me raise that sum again from wealthy Japanese . They love theme parks . I have recruited pre- eminent scientific minds from hallowed universities and we 've taken the time to do things right .
GRANT: What exactly do you mean biological attractions ?
HAMMOND: As you well know , long ago , creatures ten times larger than whales roamed ou adolescent Earth . And then mass , mysterious extinction created a time arrier unscalable until now .
GRANT: Yes ?
HAMMOND: Dinosaurs . I 've been cloning dinosaurs ! CAMERA PUSHES IN on Grant 's incredulous face .
GENNARO: At least every rich child .
HAMMOND: Apatosaurs in the lowland . Gallimimus in the grassy plain . Dilophosaurus above the river . The mighty Tyrannosaurus Rex ! 238 fabulous creatures so far !
TIMMY: Real dinosaurs , Grandpa ? Do n't they want to just kill each other ?
HAMMOND: Timmy , there 's electric fences and moats and video surveillance at all times . There are monitors every hundred feet whatever we could plant them on the island . A computer to tabulate it all .
ELLIE: You created dinosaurs ? Who gave you the ight to do that ?
HAMMOND: I did n't create them . I found a way to wake them up , to stir them out of thei prehistoric slumber .
GRANT: We do n't have the science . There 's no source of dinosaur DNA .
HAMMOND: Yes there is .
ARNOLD: Oh , you 'd survive just fine without me .
HAMMOND: Everything 's controlled from here . Remote everything . Cars , feeding programs , medicine dispensers , fecal clean up - and that can be tons in a park like this . We run this place with twenty workers . This computer does it all . And it polices each and every single animal out there .
ELLIE: Who polices the computer ?
HAMMOND: That 's where I will watch the astonished watchers . Okay , let 's go .
NEDRY: Thanks for the kind word , Mr. Hammond .
ARNOLD: Come on , Dennis , he knows your technical contributions have made it all possible .
NEDRY: Right .
TIMMY: That stuff turns you into a mutant !
HAMMOND: Do n't mind the signs . They 're only legal precautions .
LEX: It 's gold !
TIMMY: It 's amber . Fossilized tree sap .
LEX: Grandpa found gold . Grant shushes the kids and looks to Hammond .
HAMMOND: You 're both right . Amber is our gold . The alpha or our alchemic alphabet . The precious course of our genetic material . You already know amber is the fossilized esin of prehistoric tree sap , of course . Grant and Ellie nod impatiently . Hammond sets the scene .
GRANT: Like mosquitos -
HAMMOND: Like mosquitos , precisely , Dr. Grant .
GRANT: Mosquitos that sucked the blood of dinosaurs . That 's your source of DNA
HAMMOND: The extraction room speaks for itself .
GRANT: It does ?
LEX: That 's a million year old mosquito ?
ELLIE: Put in a piece of amber , find a mosquito , drill it out . Right ?
HAMMOND: Right . You are witnessing the extraction of tissue from the thorax of this humble insect . If this mosquito has ingested any foreign red blood cells - say it bit a hadrosaur or a stegosaurus or a T-Rex - we will extract those blood cells and obtain paleo-DNA , the how-to-build instruction ook of an extinct creature . So you see , Ellie , I 'm not creating dino- saurs . Fossils left behind the information , the map of how to bring them back . I 'm helping them escape from the confined of time .
GRANT: But even thousands of mosquitos would n't give you enough tissue to determine a complete DNA strand .
HAMMOND: Right you are , Dr. Grant ! More like hundreds of thousands of mosquitos are necessary to provide even a partial strand of DNA . And without a complete strand , we do n't have a dinosaur .
WU: Finally , you are here ! I 've been working without the encouragement of my peers fo too long . Welcome , welcome ! He kisses Ellie , who takes it in stride . Gennaro , We already knows .
HAMMOND: Do n't forget to thank me when you pick up your Nobel prize . Hammond and Wu resume the tour .
WU: These are Hamachi-Hood automated gene sequencers , those are Cray XMP 's , supercomputers that take DNA information and organize it . In this room , we take fragmented or incomplete DNA strands and compare them to other incomplete strands .
HAMMOND: It 's like finding the missing pieces of a jigsaw puzzle .
WU: The computers make seve al trillion calculations to provide us with a complete DNA strand - the genetic code of an extinct animal .
GRANT: Okay , you have your `` complete '' DNA strand . How do you grow it ?
WU: We use unfertilized crocodile ova as ou eeding medium .
HAMMOND: Our primordial soup .
GRANT: And how do you know what it is you 're growing ? Wu shrugs .
WU: Well , we have computer techniques to try and map out finds on an evolutionary asis . But mostly , we just grow it and find out what it is . If it 's something we 're interested in , and it survives , we keep it . Grant and Ellie share a concerned look .
GENNARO: And if you 're not interested ?
LEX: Come look !
WU: This is the incubation room . We keep the temperature at ninetynine degrees and a elative humidity of one hundred percent .
LEX: I 'm melting ! Ellie laughs and pulls Lex close .
WU: Reptile eggs contain large amounts of yolk but no water at all . The embryos must extract water from the surrounding environment .
GRANT: That 's why you create the mist .
WU: Children , please do not touch ! The eggs are permeable to skin oils .
GRANT: What kind of eggs are these ? Are these shells plastic ?
WU: Yes , they are , The embryos are mechanically inserted and then hatched in this room . But we 've managed to sufficiently mimic the actual biological process - these creatures rupture the plastic membrane that they 're contained in when they 're born . Like real births .
HAMMOND: There 's no problem Dr. Wu ca n't handle . Now who wants to see the real thing ?
GENNARO: so naturally , Hammond 's going to present everything in the best light . I need to know that this park is safe .
ELLIE: I 'll tell you something that troubles me from the start . The carnivores are all well-fed and kept separated from thei natural prey . That 'll keep 'em alive , ut it wo n't keep 'em happy .
GENNARO: How do you mean ?
ELLIE: The carnivores will want to hunt . It 's an instinct . And that instinct will have to be satisfied or suppressed .
HAMMOND: Gennaro is putting negative ideas into Ellie 's head . He 's a naysayer . I have no affection for that type of thinking .
GRANT: Do n't worry . Ellie makes her own judgments .
REGIS: Hey ! Great day for a tour !
GENNARO: Looks like rain to me .
REGIS: No ! I told the rain-god to hold it off till we got back .
HAMMOND: Kids , mind Mr. Regis . He 's in charge now .
GENNARO: Ever get the feeling we 're just Hammond 's damn guinea pigs ?
GRANT: I like to wait and see .
REGIS: Look
GRANT: Ellie ! Can you imagine the excavation team seeing this !
REGIS: Congratulations . You 're the first kids in the whole wide world ever to see real dinosaurs . The
ELLIE: Alan ? Alan ? He fainted !
GENNARO: My God , we 're going to make a fortune here !
HAMMOND: He fainted . I 've waited fifteen years to impress that young man .
ARNOLD: Oh Mr. Hammond , I 'm sorry to interrupt you , but Muldoon needs you by the pit .
HAMMOND: Oh , balls .
GRANT: Ellie ? What the hell are we going to do with the rest of our lives ? Ellie smiles at him , puzzled .
ELLIE: What to you mean ?
GRANT: Ca n't you see it , Ellie ? We 're the ones that are extinct now .
ALL THREE: Dilophosaurus !
GENNARO: Poisonous d inosaurs , there 's a liability issue without a lot of precedent .
GRANT: It 's like a Gila monster of a cobra . It 's a poison
ELLIE: Spitter !
MULDOON: These raptors are too damn dangerous . One of them tunneled out this morning . He ipped a boy 's arm off before I could get a bullet in him .
HAMMOND: A bullet ? Muldoon - no ! Now what ? I have five left ?
MULDOON: John , they 're mean as scorpions and smart as chimps . Their little fingers make them natural cage-breakers . We should terminate the raptor program . They 're just too smart . Too damn smart .
HAMMOND: Oh balls . I will not terminate the raptors just because they 're behaving normally . They 're hunters . Why ca n't we contain them properly ?
MULDOON: John , remember back in '88 , when we started to build the containment devices ?
HAMMOND: It 's just a zoo , Muldoon . A zoo . Figure out a way to contain them . And we 'll sit down and have a nice long discussion about aptors - after my guests leave , okay ?
MULDOON: Okay ! Get a 'dozer , start digging round the pit . We 're gon na bury some fence . And wear your rifle when you 're working !
HAMMOND: Wh ere are they ? Punch 'em up .
ARNOLD: They 'll be by the trike 's in a moment . Trike 's sick again .
HAMMOND: How can you say it so matter-of-factly ? The trike 's . You casually accept it , but I never can . You know what it means when you say `` by the trikes '' ? `` By the trike 's '' means that they 're out there by the species triceratops horridus . It astounds me every time what I 've done here . What magic , what alchemy . We turned a piece of a rock into a dinosaur . I will never be complacent about that .
NEDRY: Coffee anyone ?
HAMMOND: Hello skipper , John Hammond , how are you tonight ? I certainly do n't want to imperil anyone . But can you give us one more container of food ? Then we 'll feel comfortable is the storm delays you eturn . Could you help us out here ? Of course , if it looks too choppy just go , ut you 'd be doing us a big favor .
RADIO: Well we 'll do our best , sir . We 'll get one more container off . How 's that ?
LEX: I feel so sorry for her . She 's so sick .
VET: We do n't know what 's wrong with Freda . Every six we eks she gets like this .
REGIS: Oh , she 'll be up and around in no time . After a big night , I feel the same way . Grant very gently opens the Trike 's mouth .
GRANT: Poor girl . What 's the matter ? Ellie , look at this .
ELLIE: Microvesicles . Interesting .
LEX: Does n't she have a mommy and a daddy ?
HARDING: We make these dinosaurs in the lab , sweetheart . But they do form attachments . Freda has a little one that follows he around , thinks Freda 's his mom . Grant starts to look around .
ELLIE: What does sh e eat ? Where does she feed ?
HARDING: Animal this size takes in a minimum of six hundred pounds of plants a day . We truck in hay and meadow grasses seven times a day . That 's all she touches .
ELLIE: West Indian Lilacs !
GRANT: These 'd give anybody a stomachache .
HARDING: I 'm telling you , the animals do n't eat do n't eat that stuff .
TIMMY: Dr. Grant , sir ? How 'bout these ? There ' s lots of little piles of these ?
GRANT: Hey , Ellie take a look at his . Good work , Timmy .
ELLIE: Extremely smooth . Purple stains , could e those lilac berries .
HARDING: I do n't get it .
GRANT: Looks like your trike swallows stones to help her digest her food . Walking around , she crushes berries against the stones . And even just a little crushed erry is eventually enough ,
ELLIE: So , she poisons herself periodically .
HARDING: Bet we tested her saliva for any trace of -
GRANT: But with th e stones , she swallows them and probably bypasses any mucosal contact . Straight to the stomach . I would test her excrement .
LEX: Yo , yuk !
GENNARO: Hey Regis , where are your rain gods ? It 's gon na pour . Let 's finish our tour .
ELLIE: I 'm staying . Grant smiles at her decision .
GRANT: Soil samples ?
ELLIE: You read my mind . I think she 's sicker then they 're saying . Her skin is dry and flaky . And her gums are pale . I 'm going to talk to Dr. Wu .
GRANT: Good idea . I 'll keep my eyes open .
TOUR: The mighty T-Rex arose late in dinosau history . Dinosaurs ruled the earth for a hundred and twenty million years , but there were tyrannosaurs for only the last fifteen million years of that period
GRANT: Maybe she 's down hunting apatosaurs .
MULDOON: Just checking in . Everything ok ?
HAMMOND: Look at them . Leaning out the windows , so eager . They ca n't wait to see it . They have come for the danger .
MULDOON: That 's what I 'm afraid of .
LEX: What 's going to happen to the goat ? Is the T-Rex gon na come eat the goat ?
GRANT: He 's here . The goat is tethered in the middle of the fi eld , thirty yards from the
REGIS: Looks like the Rex will have its snack a little later today .
RECORDED VOICE: The sensors do n't see the Rex around . She usually comes within five minutes of hearing dinner . If she does n't , that means she 's sleeping - we might have access to her at the picnic area .
LEX: I did n't want to see him get eaten . I liked the goat .
ED: What is a carnivore got out ?
HAMMOND: Damn those people . They are so negative .
ARNOLD: It 's natural . They ca n't fully appreciate that we 've engineered the animals and the park for total safety .
HAMMOND: They comb this island like a bunch of accountants . They do n't experience the wonder , the awe of it all .
ARNOLD: You ca n't make people experience wonder .
HAMMOND: It 's like the Garden of Eden out there . This is the most beautiful time of day .
ARNOLD: Better rout the tour back . They can start again sun-up tomorrow morning .
HAMMOND: Yup . Call the kitchen . Those kids 'll be hungry when they get in .
NEDRY: Sorry 'bout that . I 've taken all the lines to upload some data .
CLOSE ON: - Nedry 's fat finger punching a last key .
LEX: Hey , is that bathroom working ?
REGIS: Sure . Rest stop .
GRANT: Is that still the T-Rex paddock ?
REGIS: Yes . But she never comes here . I do n't know why not . Probably too much construction .
NEDRY: Yup ! Looks like a never-ending weekend for me . I 'm gon na get a Diet Coke . Do n't touch my console , ok ? Line will e clear in five minutes .
HAMMOND: Slob !
ARNOLD: Well , at least he knows what he 's doing .
REGIS: Everything 's just fine . It 's a temporary glitch due to the rain . No doubt , they 're going to re-rout some circuits ack at the mainframe . We 'll have the power back on in moments . Let 's get back in the cruisers , they may start up , and I 'd like us all to be seated in them .
GENNARO: I knew we should n't have kids here .
LEX: Mr. Regis , are dinosaurs nocturnal ?
REGIS: No , darling , of course not .
LEX: Mr. Regis ? What 's nocturnal ?
REGIS: Do n't you worry about d inosaurs . They 're all very safe in their paddocks just like animals in a big , strong zoo . They 're not going anywhere we do n't tell them to go . Timmy looks out the window excitedly .
NEDRY: Okay , little ones ! Here we go !
HAMMOND: What 's going on , Arnold ? I want those lights on . I do n't want my grandchildren scared .
ARNOLD: Jesus , the computer 's gone down .
HAMMOND: Well , I want the computer up . This is the wrong weekend for glitches .
ARNOLD: That 's not the worst of it .
HAMMOND: Oh yeah ? Please tell me what 's worse than the lights going out ? Wu smashes through the door .
WU: All the security doors are open . Someone has been in my laboratory and the eggs have been disturbed . The camera pushes in on Hammond 's face .
HAMMOND: Where the hell is Nedry ? Where is he ? Did anybody check the damn john ? Hammond storms out .
MULDOON: John , the generator 's shut down . Who cut the power ?
HAMMOND: Arnold 's on it . You go out and bring ack the tour right away . I do n't need any of this !
NEDRY: Oh , shit !
MULDOON: Get out , get out ! I need this jeep . There 's a problem with the tour . Ellie , Hammond 'll fill you in . Ellie is concerned , the n decisive .
ELLIE: No ! I 'm going with you , Muldoon . They race out .
CAPTAIN FARRELL: Good . Glad to see you . Were you seen ?
NEDRY: Nah . I 'm back in five minutes , they 'll never know I was gone . Careful with that thing ! It 's worth more than the ship . When 's the copter meeting you ?
CAPTAIN FARRELL: It 's not . The storm 's coast-to-coast ,
NEDRY: Shit ! What 's the backup ? I do n't like this . Maybe we should do it another time , I do n't like it . I just do n't like -
CAPTAIN FARRELL: Shhh ! I wired Baker , he 'll have a man at the dock in Puntaremas . We should be able to make that in time .
NEDRY: Ten hours ?
CAPTAIN FARRELL: Yeah , now relax . I got a lot riding on this too , you know . No one 's going to mess up now . Baker 's not going to mess up . His people wo n't let him .
NEDRY: Ok. Ok . Here .
TIMMY: Hey , these thing work great . I can see in the dark and I can see far .
REGIS: Timmy , can you give her the goggles ?
TIMMY: Want to look at the boat , Lex ?
LEX: Hey , that fat guy 's down there . Is he gon na come get us and take us to Grandpa ?
TIMMY: You mean an incubator ?
REGIS: Let me see . Give them to men , sweetheart .
TIMMY: We saw that computer guy helping 'em load an incubator onto the ship .
GRANT: I would n't like to see dinosaurs running around Costa Rica .
GENNARO: When 's the damn power coming on ?
MULDOON: Strong legs .
ELLIE: Lot of track in college .
LEX: I 'm hungry . When can we get going ?
REGIS: When the electricity comes back on , honey . These cars run on electric cables uried in the road .
LEX: Feels like a vibration .
REGIS: Jesus Christ .
LEX: Bad language .
REGIS: Jesus Christ . The fence is n't electrified .
LEX: Is that bad ?
TIM: Mr. Regis ! Mr. Regis , where are you going ?
LEX: He just left us . He just left us all alone . Timmy , Timmy how could he do that ? We 're all alone ! We 're all alone !
GENNARO: Holy shit ! Any suggestions what we do now ?
LEX: It 's too , too dark out there . Tim waves his hands in caution .
TIMMY: Are you ok ? Be quiet and do n't move . Lex barely nods and grabs Timmy 's hand .
GENNARO: Extinct animals should stay extinct !
GRANT: Lex , are you okay ?
LEX: Timmy 's unconscious , he wo n't move .
GRANT: Let go please . The Rex ROARS above . They look up .
NEDRY: Shit . I 'm going to have to change clothes .
TIMMY: Oh shit !
GRANT: Timmy . Are you ok ?
TIMMY: Thank God you 're here . Where 's Lex ?
GRANT: Below . She 's fine . Let 's get you down . Timmy nods . Grant peers throug
TIMMY: Thanks , Dr. Grant .
GRANT: You owe me one .
TIMMY: There 's Lex . He runs . Grant follows .
GRANT: Come on out now , Lex .
TIMMY: It 's your turn to wear the goggles , Lex .
LEX: You did ?
GRANT: Cone on , Lex , it must be cold in there . And tight . Why do n't you come out ?
LEX: I 'm afraid of the `` animals '' .
TIMMY: The `` animals '' are gone .
LEX: Where did it go ?
TIMMY: I do n't kno w but it 's not here now .
LEX: Are there any grownups out there ?
GRANT: I 'm a grownup , Lex . Come on out . Gimmie you hand , come on , here you go .
LEX: I 'm hungry .
GRANT: Me , too . We 've got to get ourselves back to civilization .
REGIS: Noooooo !
TIMMY: What 's going on ?
GRANT: It 's Regis and the Rex is after him . But it 's okay . Regis knows the Rex ca n't see him . Evidently , he can only see move- ment . Regis 'll be ok if he stays still .
GRANT: Let 's go !
ELLIE: Oh , My God ! Where 's the other one ? Before the cruiser stops , she j umps out . Muldoon shouts a whisper .
MULDOON: Ellie !
ELLIE: Then they must be out there . They must e out there . I know it .
MULDOON: Perhaps .
ELLIE: No ! They 're out there .
MULDOON: I 've seen a lot of animal attacks in the ush . It 's not as gory and horrifying to see as you 'd think . No pools of blood o exposed bones . There is usually little o no evidence left behind . And if victims are small , a predator can kill by just shaking the little thing to death , eating it , and leave not so much as a button . A definite RUSTLING in the brush .
ELLIE: Looks like you 've been through this efore . Muldoon looks up .
MULDOON: I told you I 've seen big game attacks in Africa . She starts the engine .
ELLIE: Right . Ellie skids out of there .
WU: Why ?
ARNOLD: Because Nedry messed with the code . That 's why I 'm checking it .
WU: But that could take weeks . What would be faster ? Try keychecks . Arnold snaps his fingers , grabs Wu ,
ARNOLD: That 's true . Keychecks will give me a ecord of every button Nedry pushed .
WU: What 's that ?
ARNOLD: Some sort of object . Let 's see if we can trace it .
WU: What 's it mean ?
ARNOLD: It was n't a bug . It was a trap door that fat bastard left for himself . When he hit WHTE-RBT . OBJ , it initiates a set of commands that turned the whole goddamn park off . Hammond was right about him .
WU: If I did that I 'd leave a way to turn it ack on . In case I had to . I 'm sure Nedry did . You 're find it . Arnold nods grimly .
MULDOON: We found Gennaro . He 'd badly injured . Harding 's tending to him in you quarters . He 'll be all right if we can
HAMMOND: I 'm sure you 'll find them .
MULDOON: I certainly hope so .
HAMMOND: I 'm sure we will . After all , I keep telling everyone , this park is made fo children .
MULDOON: Just so you understand that they 're missing , sir .
HAMMOND: Missing ? Of course I know they 're missing . You just said that . Look , Bob , let 's not get carried away . We 've had a little breakdown from the storm o whatever , and as a result we 've had a egrettable , unfortunate accident . And that 's all that happened . We 're dealing with it . Arnold will get the computers cleaned up , and the radio and phone lines open . You 'll find those kids and my good friend , Dr. Grant . I 'm sure they 'll want some of this ice cream . It 's very good .
GENNARO: That Rex did n't even give me his full attention . That 's what hurts . I was just an afterthought . I gave him my full attention .
HARDING: He 's had a lot of morphine .
GENNARO: Not enough .
ELLIE: I need to find Wu . I have to run a few tests in his lab .
HARDING: He 's probably in the control room , get- ting in the way while Arnold tries to put things together . As Ellie leaves , Genna o is singing a shanty in his morphine stupor .
GENNARO: Yo ho , I 'll close this place down
LEX: I 'm tired .
TIMMY: You 're too big to be carried .
LEX: But I 'm tired-tired .
GRANT: Okay , Lex . Grant picks her up .
LEX: Do n't you see ? Do n't you see ?
GRANT: What ?
LEX: The fence .
GRANT: No .
TIMMY: Oh I do , right there !
LEX: Timmy 's scared of heights . Timmy spins in fury .
TIMMY: Shut up .
GRANT: Okay with the fence , Timmy ?
LEX: 'Fraid of heights .
GRANT: A herbivore grazing area . Excellent .
TIM: We gon na walk all night ? Grant looks at his watch .
GRANT: Twelve hours before that ship reaches the mainland .
TIM: We need sleep .
GRANT: Up there .
TIM: Climb ? Again ? I ca n't climb again ? Grant smiles .
GRANT: Sure you can .
TIMMY: It 's ok , Lex . Everything 's gon na be okay .
WU: What is taking Arnold so long ? This room is too cold . My eggs will be damaged .
ELLIE: No sign of those berries . Really interesting . There are indications of a similar virus in every tissue sample . But it 's not in the ground . Could I look at some of the discarded embryos ?
WU: I 'm sure you 'll find your virus or a similar one . All animals carry many viruses in a dormant condition . It 's almost impossible to say with certainty which are the same strains .
ELLIE: And yet from what Harding tells me , many of you animals have similar symptoms - esides the microvesicles , a lack of hunger , loss of reproductive urges , sores in the mouth and gums . Wu waves his arms .
WU: What the hell does Harding know ? He 's a veterinarian , not a pathologist .
MULDOON: What is it ? Arnold points to the screen .
ARNOLD: That 's it . Muldoon comes closer .
MULDOON: That 's what ?
ARNOL: D I found the command to restore the original code . It resets the linked parameters .
MULDOON: The fences and the power ?
ARNOLD: Right . And it does something else . It erases the code lines that refer to it . It destroys all evidence it was ever there .
MULDOON: Nedry could steal the eggs , get back and eset the whole show . No one would eve miss him .
ARNOLD: Watch this .
MULDOON: Are the fences back on ?
ARNOLD: You bet they are . It will take a few seconds to get up to full power , because we 've got fift y miles of fence out there , and the generator has to feed the capacitors along the way . But in a half a minute we 'll be back in business .
MULDOON: Motion sensors ?
ARNOLD: Got them too . It will be a few minutes while the computer counts . Then I 'll tell you where Grant and the kids are and you can go and get them . But every- thing 's working . Half past ten and we 've got the whole thing back up and running . Muldoon picks up a phone , shakes his head .
MULDOON: Just hiss .
ARNOLD: There 's a lot of extraneous movement out there . Branches blowing , birds , back- ground movement . It may take , ah , okay , count 's finished .
MULDOON: Shit . I do n't know where they are . I wish I could go out there But I have n't got anything to use on the Rex . My ocket launcher 's in the jeep Nedry stole . And going out with a big gun in the dark would be suicide
ELLIE: Why do n't you get some sleep , Dr. Wu ? I 'm just going to run a couple more tests and then I 'm going to turn in myself .
WU: No point in everyone being exhausted .
LEX: He gon na eat us ?
GRANT: I do n't think so . She 's a
LEX: Come here , babies ! Get your eakfast !
GRANT: Like the trike . Maybe it 's not the stones .
MULDOON: Where the hell are they going ?
GRANT: Tim , I think there 's a motion senso across the field and down there .
TIM: Where 's Lex ?
LEX: C'mere boy , c'mere . She tosses the fruit . CLOSE ON - the fruit rolling away .
TIM: Dr. Grant , Dr. Grant , look .
LEX: Whoa !
GRANT: Go home now . Home to Freda !
LEX: Oh , let him stay . He likes me to ride him . He could carry me instead of you , Dr. Grant . Please , let him stay , Grant shakes his head ,
GRANT: Go ! Go away . Go ! Get out of here !
LEX: Will I ever play with him again ?
GRANT: We got ta get to that motion detector . It 's still a ways .
MULDOON: I found Nedry ! In the distance , the call is ECHOED .
BEARDED WORKE: R I found him !
HAMMOND: He , Donald . Glad you 're awake . I hope you 're not going to take this little mishap you had and hold it against my park . It would be terrible if the finishing funds were in any way held up .
GENNARO: Oh good , 'cause I love the park ! It 's more than we ever dreamed ! Those achiosaurs are so big ! And those Spitters - - incredible ! I only have one problem . Are n't we going to have pterodactyls ? Oh , they 'd fly away !
HAMMOND: Take a look at these , Donald . Have you seen these ? These are great .
HARDING: You 'll have to bear with him , Mr. Hammond . He 's doped to infinity and back .
WU: Who gave you permission - Ellie attacks back .
ELLIE: I 'm here to investigate this park . And there 's plenty you have n't told me .
WU: That 's absurd .
ELLIE: These bones are n't fully formed .
WU: You 're qualified to interpret x-rays of living dinosaurs ? I doubt it . It took me many months to learn .
WU: You 're making a lot of assumptions here .
ELLIE: Right . What the hell is going on , Wu ?
WU: She did n't have a right to explore my lab .
HAMMOND: Let 's not argue , Wu , we have a serious problem . These animals do n't last . There is a egularity , a predictability about when they die . It 's always very young . We do n't know why . Given time , I 'm sure Wu will figure it out . It 's just
WU: Just some adjustment in the code is equired .
HAMMOND: But there are deadlines . The park opens next summer . And it requires full-grown specimens . So Wu uses growth hormones to achieve the desired size in a short amount of time . But they all keep dying and we do n't know how to stop it .
ELLIE: Gennaro 's losing a lot of blood . He needs transfusions . We got ta get a escue helicopter . Arnold , what 's with the phones ?
ARNOLD: Ah hell . I just ca n't find it .
ELLIE: Find what ?
ARNOLD: Nedry jammed all the communication lines . He inserted some command , a lockout into the program code . I ca n't find it , ecause I gave that restore command and it erased part of the program listings .
WU: So ? Just reset - shut the system down and you 'll clear the memory . Everything will be in the normal wakeup mode .
ARNOLD: Shut the system down ?
WU: And reset .
ARNOLD: I 've never done that before . And I 'm eluctant to do it . Maybe it 's t ue , all systems will come on , but maybe they wo n't .
ELLIE: Look , there is a sick man here who needs medical attention or he 'll die . Fou people are out there , missing in you park . We need search teams . We have to have a phone or radio . Arnold still hesitates .
ARNOLD: Well , it 's just that the safety systems do n't function with the computer shut down and - Ellie boils over .
ELLIE: - turn the goddamn safety systems off ! Ca n't you get it through your head that we have no choice ?
ARNOLD: Okay .
ELLIE: How long do we have to wait ?
ARNOLD: Thirty seconds .
GRANT: What is it ?
LEX: I hear something .
GRANT: Come on .
LEX: Hear it now ?
TIMMY: You 're hearing things . Come on , we got ta get back and warn them about the boat .
GRANT: They 're agitated .
LEX: I told you I heard something !
GRANT: Outta the way , kids ! Run !
ARNOLD: Memory should be cleared by now .
ELLIE: What 's wrong ?
ARNOLD: Oh hell ! I have to turn the safety switches ack on before I restart the power .
ELLIE: Arnold ! They 're still not working .
ARNOLD: No , it sounds dead but after a reset , all system modules have to be brought on line manually .
WU: Arnold 's about to get the phones up . Arnold pushes the chair back .
ARNOLD: Okay , we 're up again ! Ellie grabs the phone back up .
ELLIE: No we 're not . Phones still dead . Arnold swings her way .
ARNOLD: Ca n't be -
HAMMOND: My God , look at this , Arnold .
ELLIE: What 's happening ?
ARNOLD: The duckbills .
WU: My good God .
ELLIE: What ?
ARNOLD: It 's the Rex
HAMMOND: They 've stampeded
TIMMY: Let 's go . Now !
HAMMOND: No ! Oh no ! He make a kill . He killed one of my animals ! Where 's Muldoon ?
ARNOLD: I 'm sorry , Mr. Hammond .
HAMMOND: My animals ! My animals !
MUL: DOON I just came to tell you - you 're minus one computer expert .
GRANT: We 'll walk by the river . That leads back to the Visitor 's center .
LEX: Not me . I 'm not walking anymore .
TIMMY: Come on Lex , I 'll carry you .
LEX: Nope . Too scared .
GRANT: You ready ? She wipes her tears .
LEX: Can we go on the raft ? Then we do n't have to walk so close to the animals !
GRANT: What raft ?
GRANT: It 's still mid-morning . I bet we have at least ten miles to go . If we take the aft along the river , we can make much faster progress .
TIMMY: Let 's do it .
GRANT: Lex , I do n't see any raft .
TIMMY: Keep going .
GRANT: Bullseye ! Timmy is reliev ed . Lex smiles .
LEX: Told you ! Grant grabs them . Looks around , still -
GRANT: No raft . Where did you see it , Lex ?
LEX: Actually , I never really saw one . Just assumed .
GRANT: Assumed ? She nods . Grant and Timmy resume looking .
TIMMY: Lex ! Lex ! You 're okay , you 're okay !
TIMM: Y Look , Lex ! Look !
GRANT: I 'm afraid there 's no raft .
LEX: I 'll row , Dr. Grant .
GRANT: No .
LEX: Hey , we 're still moving . Grant looks into the water . She 's right .
GRANT: There 's a current .
LEX: You ca n't sleep .
GRANT: I 'm not sl eeping yet .
LEX: I 'll do it ! Lex picks up the oars and begins .
TIMMY: We got ta warn them about the boat .
GRANT: Guess I was wrong .
LEX: I ca n't swim !
GRANT: Hold on real tight .
TIMMY: Hold my hand . Hold my hand when we go .
GRANT: I 'm trying . I 'm trying Ooooo ! ! ! . His hands slipping , slipping
MULDOON: Son-of-a-bitch . He 's taking a nap . Has n't been this well fed ever .
HAMMOND: Could he drown in that position ? That 's a very valuable animal .
MULDOON: I know it 's a valuable animal .
WU: What 's that , John ? Wu points to the screen behind Arnold 's head . In the upper right-hand
ELLIE: You running on auxiliary power ?
ARNOLD: I 'm not .
WU: Looks like you are .
ARNOLD: Ca n't be .
WU: Print the system status log .
HAMMOND: What the hell is going on ?
ARNOLD: I know it 's hard , I know it 's hard , but I 'm going to put it all back together fo you - I promise . I will
LEX: The waterfall stopped .
TIMMY: Waterfalls are n't supposed to stop .
GRANT: I think they cut the power . Hey -
HAMMOND: Told him , fix my park , fix my park .
WU: You shut down as six thirty-four this morning , and when you started back up , it was with auxiliary power .
ARNOLD: Jesus . The auxiliary generator fires up first and then that 's used to start the main generator because it needs a heavy charge . The main generator has to be manually reset .
WU: Outside ? In the generator building ?
MULDOON: This does n't mean the fences have been off since six-thirty , does it ?
ARNOLD: Backup power does n't generate enough amperage to power the electrified fences , so they were automatically kept off . That 's also why we had no phones o adio .
MULDOON: All of the fences ?
ARNOLD: Yes .
MULDOON: Including the velociraptor mesh ?
ARNOLD: Yes , yes , yes .
HAMMOND: Do you mean those rapto s could be loose ?
ARNOLD: I 'm afraid so .
MULDOON: No , no way . Last time , it took 'em two days to chew through that mesh . But give 'em enough time , they 'll get out . We etter get that power on now .
HAMMOND: Regardless , check the pit . Make sure there ' five of them there .
ARNOLD: What 's that steam coming out of my generator room ?
MULDOON: Relax , it 's just refrigerated air . There 's a leaky cooling pipe . I fixed it a couple times before but the original installation was at too sharp an angle .
ELLIE: Arnold 's not with you ?
MULDOON: I was hoping he was ba ck here already . Hammond takes charge .
HAMMOND: This is why my quarters were specially fortified . To assist in an emergency just like this one . Let 's go . Muldoon , round up the workers . They 'll go with us too .
ELLIE: Wait . What about Arnold ?
TIMMY: We 're home ! Lex and Grant happily run down the hill .
GRANT: Sorry , Tim . We got ta climb up .
TIM: That 's all right , Dr. Grant . You owe me
MULDOON: Okay Wu , I 'll have you covered at every moment . But this shell carries quite a punch , so if you 're too close , it 'll take a piece of you . Ellie 's on the headset with you . If another ones come at you , let her know . Then Ellie - you start jumping and yelling . The buggers are easily distracted . They 'll come running and let Wu get that power on . Then both of you , get behind this fence as quick as possible .
ELLIE: Hey you cretaceous dromaeosaur , you ca n't catch me . Hey , come and get me , you flat-snouted Mongolian beast . Hey !
MULDOON: You ok ?
WU: Now , there 's four .
ELLIE: I 'm going in . Muldoon , cover the doo after I go in . Wu , guide me !
LEX: We did it !
TIM: We made it !
ELLIE: Raptor ! The raptor EXPLODES th ough the door of the generator building afte Ellie .
WU: Keep it open ! I 'm coming !
ELLIE: Come on , Wu ! Come on ! Run !
WU: Help ! Wu and the raptor are at the door .
MULDOON: No they 're not , Ellie .
ELLIE: Why did n't the power go on ?
MULDOON: You just reset the power . Now the computer has to be booted .
LEX: Where did everybody go ? Grant thinks .
GRANT: Probably your grandfather 's quarters . Let 's go . A DISTANT BELLOW . Grant reconsiders .
LEX: No , I want to stay with you . Grant looks around tensely .
GRANT: No , keep an eye on things round here fo me . I 'll be back with the others .
TIMMY: What about - Grant looks at Timmy .
GRANT: I 'll radio the ship as soon as I find somebody . You 're in charge now . Do n't move from here unless you have to , ok ?
LEX: Goody ! I 'm gon na rest .
TIMMY: Tired ! He carried you the whole way .
GRANT: Be right back .
ELLIE: Why do n't you just nail that bastard ?
MULDOON: No more ammo . I requisitioned six charges but the bean-counter - - cut it down to two .
LEX: Any candy behind the counter ?
TIMMY: Hungry ?
LEX: Starved .
TIMMY: Nothing .
LEX: Let 's go to the kitchen .
TIMMY: Dr. Grant said -
LEX: - let 's go . We 'll come right back .
TIMMY: Nope . We 're waiting here t ill Dr. Grant gets back . He 'll help us get some -
LEX: Where are we going ?
TIM: The kitchen !
ELLIE: How long ?
MULDOON: Well , they seem to be getting faster all the time . I would say - fifteen minutes . Ellie no
ELLIE: There 's a raptor on the roof of this uilding . Open that gate and you 're a dead man .
GRANT: Ellie , I 'm go glad -
ELLIE: Shut up and listen . We have about fifteen minutes here . The computer has to be rebooted . That 'll turn on the electric fences . Besides the apto stuck in here with us , there are fou more
TIMMY: We 'll freeze to death in there .
LEX: He 's going to eat us !
TIMMY: PUSH !
LEX: What is it , Timmy ?
TIMMY: I just remembered something . Rapto s are orn in large litters . There 's probably more coming . We got ta hide .
GRANT: Timmy , you know anything about computers ?
TIMMY: Well , I just got an XT at home . I told my Dad I wanted a 386 .
GRANT: Ok good , you 're elected .
LEX: Are they going to be ok ?
GRANT: If we can get help very soon .
TIMMY: Sshh , you guys , I 'm thinking .
TIM: I think this is the boat . They called it the Queen Anne or something . Grant grabs the mike .
GRANT: Queen Anne , do you read me ? Queen Anne ? The radio crackles to life .
RADIO: This is the Queen Anne B ? I copy . What 's up ?
GRANT: Report your position !
RADIO: Ah , we 're just about to dock here in Puntaremas . Who wants to know ? Please identify yourself .
GRANT: Try this for identification , Captain Farrell . You are in possession of stolen iological materials . If you do n't turn that boat around and return to Isla Nublar immediately with your contraband cargo , you will be found in violation of Section 509 of the Uniform Maritime Act , you will be subject to revocation of license , penalties in excess of fifty thousand dollars , and five years in jail . Do you copy ?
RADIO: I copy . All ahead stern .
TIMMY: What 's the Uniform Maritime Code ?
GRANT: Who the hell knows ?
LEX: What good does that do ? To have the ship turn around ? Grant turns to her seriously .
GRANT: Well it gives us ten more hours . Let 's see if we can raise the Costa Rican Coast Guard on that thing .
HAMMOND: Dr. Grant , do n't abandon this beautiful place . I need a man just like you to help me get my park back on its feet again . And it will be on its feet again .
GRANT: We have to leave now . Hammond stops .
HAMMOND: Oh you do n't know . There are wonderful plans in the works , sites already purchased for Euro-Jurassic and Jurassic Japan .
GRANT: You interrupted natural law . There are egulations , ules that nature follows that make her knowable .
HAMMOND: You mean there are rules that nature follows that create barriers to ou knowledge .
GRANT: Barriers ? Like the seasons ? The earth spinning , orbiting the sun ? The entire solar system in interlocking motion . Ou own beings in biological step with it all . Mr. Hammond , you 've disrupted the pattern and look what it 's done !
HAMMOND: I know what it 's done . I 've made triceratops and gallimimus and a T-Rex . I 've got a batch of iguanadons being born on Tuesday . What do you say to that ?
GRANT: Do n't count on it . Now get in .
HAMMOND: I created genetic miracles !
GRANT: You created a park to generate a profit- making merchandising operation .
HAMMOND: The merchandise is just a by-product . Souvenirs for people to reflect on the wonder . You fainted when you saw the achiosaur . Alan , look , let 's not argue . The problem is that my employees were not up to par with my dream . They failed me . The park , I promise you , is safe . It really is . Grant grabs Hammond 's arm , starts to tug .
GRANT: You park is doomed . Now come with me .
HAMMOND: It is not ! It 's blooming ! In the throes of labor ! You are one more more negative voice in a universe of negativity . You 'll amount to nothing . You 'll be a one-brusher all your life . I pity you .
GRANT: Come back , Mr. Hammond ! It 's over !
ELLIE: They 're so beautiful . They 're condemned , are n't they ? Even those embryo fragments had the same viral contamination .
GRANT: I have a theory .
ELLIE: You have a theory ? Grant smiles back at her .
ELLIE: So the very process itself was flawed .
BEN: You make sure to get us as close as you can , okay ? If it 's a good trip , I 'll give you a little extra .
ENRIQUE: Do n't worry . I take you close . But not too close . You do n't want them to eat you .
ERIC: What was that ?
BEN: Unclip your line !
GRANT: Oh , actually , Charlie , those two are herbivores . They would n't be interested in fighting each other . But these See , these are carnivores . And this one here see its claws this one here uses its claws to gouge at the throat of its opponent…
ELLIE: Uh , Alan ?
GRANT: Hmm ?
ELLIE: He 's three . Why do n't you wait till he 's a little older ?
GRANT: Oh , right . Happy dinosaurs . He bounces them along the sandbox edge .
ELLIE: That must be Mark . Mark , we ’ re back here ! Ellie and Grant turn to see
MARK: Keeping the world safe . Here , let me take her . Ellie hands off the baby .
ELLIE: Mark , this is Alan Grant .
CHARLIE: Daddy , this is a herbabore . Grant smiles uncomfortably , a third wheel .
GRANT: What 's my name ? Come on , Jack , say it . Is my name Alan ? Say my name . The bird does n't respond .
ELLIE: Sorry , Alan it 's been six years .
MARK: More coffee ?
ELLIE: Yes . Great . Mark stands and collects their cups .
GRANT: Really ? What do you do there ?
GRANT: Indeed .
ELLIE: So what are you working on now ?
ELLIE: Anything good ?
GRANT: Raptors , mostly .
ELLIE: My favorite .
GRANT: You remember the sounds they made ?
ELLIE: I try not to .
GRANT: We 've done cranial scans , and raptors actually had a quite sophisticated esonating chamber . I have a theory that their ability to vocalize is the key to thei social intelligence . The way they can work together as a team .
ELLIE: You think they could talk to each other ?
GRANT: To a degree we never imagined .
JACK: Bullshit ! Both look back at the parrot . ELLIE smiles .
ELLIE: You taught him that .
GRANT: It was never easy , but before Jurassic Park , you could find money . Somewhere . Now fossils are out . Everyone wants to see a real live dinosaur .
ELLIE: Times change Alan . But you 're the still the est . I mean that .
GRANT: The last of my breed .
ELLIE: Let me know if I can help , Alan . You ’ re bad about asking for help , but please ask me . Anything , anytime .
GRANT: Okay . Goodbye , Ellie .
ELLIE: Goodbye , Alan .
GRANT: A well-accepted theory .
ELLIE: Alan do n't be afraid to evolve .
GRANT: It 's through the painstaking study of the Interior chamber in multiple specimens that we can determine this exciting correlation etween the larynx and the upper plate . That
SYMPOSTIUM LEADER: Thank you very much Dr. Grant . Now does anyone have a question ?
GRANT: Does anyone have a question that does n't elate to Jurassic Park ? Quite a few hands go down . GRANT Or the incident in San Diego , which I 'll emind you , I did not witness .
MALE STUDENT: Your theory on raptors is good and all , but is n't all this conjecture kind of moot ? The STUDENT 'S BUDDY nods in agreement .
GRANT: No , and let me be perfectly clear on this point . Dinosaurs lived 65 million years ago . What 's left of them is fossilized in stone the actual scientists spend years to undercover .
ANOTHER STUDENT: You 're saying you would n't want to study them if you had the chance ?
UDESKY: Udesky .
CHERYL: Billy ? I do n't think I 'm doing this right .
CHERYL: I can never tell what 's bone and what 's rock .
CHERYL: Rough . and along his lips . CHERYL Smooth .
BILLY: Dr. Grant !
GRANT: Mr. Brennan .
BILLY: How was your trip ? Profitable ?
GRANT: We 'll be broke in four weeks .
BILLY: Three weeks . I had to rent some equipment .
GRANT: You rented an automated litter box .
BILLY: It 's a rapid prototyper . I feed in the scan data from the raptor skull , than the compute eaks it into thousands of slices which this thing prints , one layer on top of the other . It 's the future of paleontology .
GRANT: Not if it ca n't dig .
BILLY: I give you a raptor 's resonating chamber .
GRANT: Absolutely not .
BILLY: They 're here .
GRANT: What ? Only now does Grant realize these two people Who were walking up to them .
MAN: Dr. Grant ?
GRANT: Yes ?
MAN: Paul Kirby . Kirby Enterprises My card . PAUL KIRBY is a talkative optimist with no `` off '' switch . His wife AMANDA KIRBY , just
GRANT: What can I do for you , Mr. Kirby ?
PAUL: Well sir , I am a great admire of yours , and I have an extremely interesting proposition to discuss . Would you let my wife
GRANT: You know , I 've been traveling and I 'm very tired . Maybe some other time .
PAUL: I guarantee it 'll be worth your while .
GRANT: It 's be my pleasure .
AMANDA: It is truly , what ’ s the word ? Inspiring .
GRANT: Thank you .
AMANDA: We even have two seats reserved aboard the first commercial moon flight . Billy nudges Grant .
GRANT: Hmmm .
PAUL: Now , for our wedding anniversary this yea we wanted to do something really special , something He places his hand on his wife 's .
AMANDA: once-in-a-lifetime .
PAUL: We 've arranged for a private airplane to take us flying over Isla Sorna . And we want you to be our guide .
GRANT: That 's a very nice offer , Mr. Kirby , but I 'm afraid I 'm much to busy . If you like I can efer you to a number of highly qualified
GRANT: I 'm flattered , but I 've taken this little adventure tour . And with the ai estrictions they 've imposed after the incident in San Diego , you can ’ t fly low enough to see anything of interest .
AMANDA: You see , that 's just the thing . Paul and I have special permission to fly low .
BILLY: How low ?
PAUL: Well , I 'm no aviation specialist . But I do know it 's hell of a lot lower than anyone else .
AMANDA: From what I understand , it 's pretty much whatever we want .
GRANT: That 's hard to believe .
PAUL: Let 's just say that through my business imports/exports , emerging markets I 've made some friends in high places . In this case , the Costa Rican government .
AMANDA: Dr. Grant , you do n't know how important it is for us to have you come along . It would make all the difference .
PUAL: And of course , we 're prepared to make a sizeable contribution to your research here . Billy looks at Grant . Do n't say no . PAUL I can write all kinds of numbers on this check . Just tell me what exactly it would take . We HOLD ON a conflicted Dr. Alan Grant .
GRANT: Even with what I pay you , you could get a etter bag .
BILLY: No way . This is lucky . Couple years ago some buddies and I went hang gliding off these cliffs in New Zealand . Updraft sent me ight into the side . BOOM !
GRANT: That does sound lucky .
BILLY: It was this strap alone that saved my life . Got caught on a rock as I was falling .
GRANT: Reverse-Darwinism . Survival of the most idiotic . Because he has n't really said it
BILLY: Listen Alan , I really appreciate you inging me along .
GRANT: The bones will be there when we get back . That 's the nice thing about them . They neve un away . And besides , you got me into this . I do n't intend to be alone with these people .
BILLY: So how do you know the Kirby 's ? and we reveal
COOPER: Through our church .
BILLY: What Religion ?
RAPTOR: Alan . And than it STRIKES .
BILLY: Alan . We 're almost there .
RADIO VOICE: Unidentified aircraft approaching Isla Sorna , this is San Juan approach . You are flying in restricted airspace . Immediately
UDESKY: Cooper ! Yell up if you see anything !
COOPER: No , I thought I 'd keep it to myself . Suddenly Grant spots
GRANT: There . There ! An Apatosaur . Look at the coloration .
BILLY: I 'm so use to seeing bones . It 's weird to see skin .
GRANT: Mr. and Mrs. Kirby ! If you look out the right you can see
UDESKY: South shore is clear . The rest is rock .
NASH: Are we on ?
UDESKY: We 're on .
GRANT: That 's not the landing gear ? Paul , Amanda and Cooper do n't respond .
PAUL: Dr. Grant if you 'd just sit tight , we 'll explain this all in a jiffy .
GRANT: This plane can not land !
AMANDA: It 's going to be all right . Just
GRANT: Tell me we did n't land .
BILLY: I think they 're looking for someone .
PAUL: Dr. Grant , are you alright ? I 'm sorry we had to be so
GRANT: What the hell is going on ? What are they doing ?
PAUL: Establishing a perimeter . Making it safe . These guys are really good . One of them was a Green
GRANT: Mr. Kirby , trust me , on this island , there is no such thing as safe . We have to get back in this plane
GRANT: And tell your wife to stop making so much noise ! We 're food to these damn animals .
PAUL: Amanda , Honey ! Dr. Grant says it 's a bad idea !
AMANDA: What ?
PAUL: He says it 's a bad idea !
AMANDA: What 's a bad idea ?
PAUL: What was that ?
BILLY: Is it a rex ?
GRANT: I do n't think so .
UDESKY: We got ta go , now !
PAUL: What 's the problem ? Ca n't you guys ?
AMANDA: We ca n't just
PAUL: Do n't worry , honey . We 'll circle around and come back . Udesky closes the door .
BILLY: What about the other guy ?
UDESKY: Coop 's a professional . He can handle himself .
NASH: We 're going !
NASH: Coop , you know I ca n't do it pal .
PAUL: What are you doing ? That 's Mr. Cooper !
AMANDA: Oh , my God ! Paul , my God !
BILLY: Is anyone hurt ?
UDESKY: Quiet ! We 're okay . Let 's everybody just stay put .
NASH: Who 's got the sat-phone ?
PAUL: Right here !
RECORDED VOICE: We 're sorry . All circuits are busy . Please try your call again later
NASH: Shit !
PAUL: What is it ? What 's the matter ? Amanda SCREAMS .
BILLY: Over here !
GRANT: This way !
GRANT: Do n't worry . It 's dead . Then a full-grown bull
GRANT: Come on !
AMANDA: Our son is on this island . We need your help to find him .
PAUL: This is him . Eric . He ’ s thirteen now . He 's just about the greatest kid in the world .
AMANDA: He 's with a man named Ben Hildebrand .
BILLY: Who 's that ?
PAUL: Her new boyfriend .
AMANDA: A friend . We were vacationing . Eric wanted to see the island and the dinosaurs , so Ben found a guy who would take them parasailing . They never came back .
PAUL: We called everyone , did everything we could . Because of all the controversy over this island , no one will step in . Costa Rica says
GRANT: So you hired these mercenaries .
UDESKY: We prefer `` recovery specialists . '' We do overseas custody issues and
GRANT: Then you duped us into coming here .
PAUL: We needed somebody who knew the lay of the
GRANT: I have never been on this island !
PAUL: Sure you have . You wrote that book
BILLY: That was Isla Nublar . This is Isla Sorna . The second island .
PAUL: I did n't know , there were two islands .
GRANT: A few of us survived . A lot more died . And we were better prepared and better armed . How many days have they been missing ? A look between Amanda and Paul .
PAUL: Eight weeks .
GRANT: After what you 've seen today , you really think your son could be alive ?
AMANDA: He 's smart , Dr. Grant . And he knows so much about dinosaurs .
GRANT: No , I 'm sorry , but no . We 'll savage what we can from the plane . Then we head for the coast . There may be a boat left , something to get us off this island .
PAUL: Dr. Grant , we 're not leaving without our son .
PAUL: What do we do ?
PAUL: Excellent . They follow after Grant and Billy .
AMANDA: Nothing you have n't seen before .
PAUL: Twenty , twenty-fire pounds . I 've been swimming at the Y .
AMANDA: You hate to swim .
PAUL: People change . A nod to mean , that 's the truth .
AMANDA: So do you .
GRANT: How would you classify it ?
BILLY: Obviously a superpredator . Suchimimus . that snout .
GRANT: They never got that big .
BILLY: Baryonyx ?
GRANT: Not with that sail . Spinosaurus Aegypticus .
BILLY: I do n't remember that on InGen 's list .
GRANT: That 's because it was n't on their list . Who knows what else they were up to ?
BILLY: So Mr. Kirby , tell me , when you climbed K2 , did you base camp at 25- or 30,000 feet ?
PAUL: Thirty-thousand , I think . Closer to the top .
BILLY: About a thousand feet above it , actually . Most mountain-climbers remember how tall that mountains were . Paul knows he 's caught .
GRANT: There is no Kirby Enterprises , is there ?
PAUL: There is . I own a place called Kirby Paint and Title Plus . We 're out in the Westgate Shopping Center in Enid , Oklahoma . The `` plus '' is for bathroom fixtures , fireplaces accessories , patio furniture . Stuff like that .
BILLY: I do n't suppose that check you wrote us is any good .
UDESKY: He paid us half up front . Cash .
PAUL: Mortgaged everything we had to do it . Even the store . and if we make it off this island with my son , I swear , I 'll make good on the money I owe you . I do n't care if it takes me the rest of my life . Grant and Udesky exchange a dubious glance .
UDESKY: However long that is .
AMANDA: Eric !
GRANT: Quiet !
PAUL: Stop that . Dr. Grant says this is dangerous territory .
AMANDA: Well we should split up or something . We can cover twice the area .
PAUL: No , Dr. Grant says
AMANDA: Dr. Grant says this , Dr. Grant says that
PAUL: Well what 's the use of hiring an expert if your not going to listen to him ?
AMANDA: Because `` Dr. Grant '' is n't looking for Eric . Dr. Grant is looking for the coast .
PAUL: Fineand when the Tricyclatops comes afte you , do n't come crying to me .
AMANDA: Oh , do n't worry about that .
PAUL: What ?
AMANDA: Nothing .
PAUL: What did you say ?
AMANDA: Nothing .
PAUL: What did you say !
AMANDA: Just drop it Paul !
UDESKY: If they split up , I 'm going with you .
PAUL: Young adult .
AMANDA: Eric
UDESKY: Here , give that to me .
BILLY: It looks intact .
AMANDA: It works !
UDESKY: I do n't know for how long .
ERIC: Ben !
BEN: Unclip the line !
ERIC: I do n't know . I think so .
BEN: We 're okay . It 's going to be okay . Here , get eady . I 'm going to unhook you .
ERIC: I 'm all right
PAUL: See ? He 's okay . He 's alive ! Everything 's going to be all right now .
AMANDA: No , it 's
PAUL: I know you liked Ben . I had no right to
AMANDA: It ’ s not about him . It 's Eric . He 's alone out here somewhere . Our baby is all alone .
UDESKY: Dr. Grant !
GRANT: Raptors .
AMANDA: What ’ s a raptor ? Paul has no idea .
UDESKY: They do n't look that big . I mean , comparatively .
GRANT: If we came across one , we might live .
PAUL: Well that 's good .
GRANT: But you never came across just one . From the back
AMANDA: Wait ! Where 's Billy ? They all stop . The only one not there is Grant Billy ! Billy !
GRANT: Ah yes , the first rule of academics . Publish or perish .
PAUL: I bet there 's a very good chance Eric 's in there . I 'd bet my bottom dollar .
AMANDA: Eric !
PAUL: Let 's see . I 've got about a dollar seventy- five . How about you guys ?
BILLY: Thank God for preservatives . He tosses the food to the others .
AMANDA: This is how you make dinosaurs ?
GRANT: This is how you play God .
BILLY: Okay if I take pictures ? Grant nods .
PAUL: Amanda !
GRANT: Back out ! Move !
PAUL: In here !
AMANDA: Push !
GRANT: She 's calling for help .
BILLY: ALAN !
GRANT: KEEP GOING !
PAUL: Udesky .
AMANDA: He 's this way .
PAUL: It 's not safe .
AMANDA: We have to help him .
BILLY: He 's right . A predator would n't leave a kill wounded .
AMANDA: He 's not a kill , he 's still alive .
PAUL: They couldn ’ t climb up , so they were trying to get us to come down .
BILLY: They set a trap They actually set a trap .
PAUL: Where 's Grant ?
GRANT: What does that mean ? What are you saying ?
VOICE: Come on ! They 'll be back !
GRANT: Eric
ERIC: In Costa Rica ?
GRANT: On the island .
ERIC: They 'll never make it . I mean , they ca n't manage when the cable goes out .
GRANT: You 'd be surprised what people can do when they have too .
ERIC: You 're Alan Grant , are n't you ? I read both of your books .
GRANT: Which one do you prefer ?
GRANT: Back then , they had n't tried to eat me .
ERIC: When InGen cleared out , they left a lot of stuff behind .
GRANT: Any weapons , radios ?
ERIC: Found this , but the battery 's dead .
GRANT: It 's a wonder you are n't . I 'm amazed , Eric . I arely lasted 30 hours . You lasted eight weeks .
GRANT: The important thing is we both made it . That 's something we have in common .
ERIC: Yeah .
GRANT: What did you think ?
ERIC: I dunno . I mean , it was kind of preachy . Chaos-this , chaos-that . And like , to me , the guy seemed kind of high on himself . Grant smiles .
GRANT: That 's two things we have in common .
AMANDA: We ca n't just stop looking . Eric and Dr. Grant are out there somewhere .
BILLY: I don ’ t know .
PAUL: I thought you were an expert .
BILLY: Dr. Grant was .
AMANDA: Well Dr. Grant is n't here , so we 're going to have to figure out what to do ourselves .
PAUL: I just want you know , Amanda . It 's not your fault what happened .
AMANDA: Well what ?
PAUL: Well damn it . I do n't speak ill of the dead .
AMANDA: This would n't happen if he was with you . I mean , you drive five miles below the speed limit . I totaled three cars in fives years .
PAUL: That one time was just the bumper .
AMANDA: He would have been , safe . Completely , entirely , suffocatingly safe .
PAUL: I 'm not sorry at all .
ERIC: Know what this is ?
GRANT: A raptor claw . I use to have one . A fossil .
ERIC: Mine 's new . Grant hands it back .
GRANT: How much of this island have you explored ?
ERIC: I stayed pretty close to the compound , Figured if anyone came to look for me , that 's where they 'd start .
GRANT: We need to head for the coast .
ERIC: Are you sure ?
GRANT: Why ?
ERIC: Closer you get to the water , the bigge things get .
BILLY: We need to stick to the plan . Head for the coast .
AMANDA: What about Eric and Dr. Grant ?
BILLY: Going to the coast was Alan 's idea . If he 's alive , that ’ s where he 's headed .
AMANDA: What about Eric ?
BILLY: Sure .
PAUL: My phone .
AMANDA: You had the phone the whole time ?
BILLY: Where is it ?
PAUL: I do n't know . I do n't have it with me .
AMANDA: When did you have it last ?
PAUL: I do n't remembe
AMANDA: Think . And Paul wracks his memory
AMANDA: What ? WHAT ! ?
PAUL: I loaned it to Nash . He must have had it on him when he
ERIC: Mon ! Dad !
AMANDA: Sweetheart , you 're okay . You 're okay . You 're okay .
PAUL: Never had a doubt . Never did . Us Kirby men , we stick around , huh ?
ERIC: We do .
PAUL: Honey , there 's not enough spit in the world for that .
GRANT: We need to keep moving .
BILLY: Alan , I want to tell you that I 'm so sorry about the
GRANT: Billy , I ca n't talk to you now . He walks off . Billy follows him .
BILLY: Please , okay ? Just yell at me . Call me an idiot . An asshole . Stupid . Tell me I screwed up because I know I did . Grant does n't respond .
GRANT: Some of the worst things imaginable have een done with the best intentions . You ushed in with no thought to the consequences , to yourself or anyone else . You 're no better than the people who built this place .
ERIC: Then we go home ?
AMANDA: Then we go home . Grant leads everyone down a RAMP to
GRANT: How about if we try this way ?
AMANDA: Do you think it goes all the way across ?
GRANT: One way to find out .
PAUL: Dr. Grant ?
AMANDA: Eric , its okay . You 'll be right behind me .
PAUL: We 're not going anywhere , I promise . As Paul holds Eric , and Amanda shares a look . Amanda We 're all together now , Eric .
AMANDA: Okay ! Come on , Eric !
PAUL: How 'bout if I
ERIC: No , I can do it .
PAUL: That 's it Eric . Nice and easy
ERIC: Mom ?
GRANT: Oh , my God .
AMANDA: What is it ?
GRANT: A bird cage . Then , the sound of Eric SCREAMING .
PAUL: Eric !
BILLY: It wo n't hold ! Suddenly ,
PAUL: ERIC !
AMANDA: Paul ! Where is he ? Can you see him ?
PAUL: I 'm trying ! That thing took him down this way !
GRANT: Split up !
GRANT: BILLY ! WAIT !
BILLY: I CAN GET HIM !
GRANT: NO !
BILLY: I KNOW THE CONSEQUENCES !
PAUL: Hang on , Eric !
BILLY: Let go !
GRANT: He made it !
BILLY: Get back ! Get back !
GRANT: Billy !
PAUL: It 's no use , Dr. Grant . No use .
PAUL: My own kid was right in front of me and I did n't do a damn thing .
AMANDA: You could n't have made that jump .
PAUL: I should have tried . It should have been me on that beach back there , not Billy .
AMANDA: How would you have helped Eric ? He needs you , Paul . He needs us .
PAUL: He could have died .
AMANDA: But he did n't . And neither did you . And I 'm glad about that .
ERIC: Do you have any kids ?
GRANT: No . Although I 've studied them in the wild . Eric looks over , not sure what that means .
ERIC: I want to be an astronaut .
GRANT: See , I was the opposite . I never understood why anyone would want to go into space . It 's so dangerous . You do one thing wrong and you 're dead . The astronomer or the paleontologist get to study these amazing things from a place of complete safety . And truthfully , everything you really need to learn , you can learn it from the ground .
ERIC: But then you never get to go in space .
GRANT: Exactly . The difference between imagining how things might be and seeing how they eally are . To be able to touch them . That 's what Billy wanted to do .
GRANT: Keep quiet .
PAUL: I 've got something . I think I 've got something !
AMANDA: I 've got it ! I 've got it !
PAUL: Ca n't help but be a little offended .
GRANT: Well , we do n't exactly have a Costa Rican phone book here , so it will have to be somebody we know in the states . Someone we can absolutely count on to send help .
PAUL: Stan .
AMANDA: I would n't trust Stan with a snowball in a lizzard .
ERIC: What 's that ?
GRANT: Bonitas .
ERIC: Something must 've scared them .
GRANT: Get the motor going .
AMANDA: Who are you calling ? But Grant ignores the question . RING . RING .
GRANT: Pick up ! Pick up !
CHARLIE: Hewwo ?
GRANT: Charlie ? Charlie . Get your mother . Right away !
CHARLIE: Hewwo ?
GRANT: Charlie ! It 's the dinosaur man ! Go get mommy , okay ?
CHARLIE: Okay .
ELLIE: Was somebody on the phone ?
CHARLIE: Dinosaur man .
GRANT: ELLIE !
ELLIE: Alan ? She can hear the Spinosaurus ROAR .
CHARLIE: Raaaar !
AMANDA: PAUL !
ERIC: DAD !
GRANT: Up ! Up !
ERIC: Where 's Dad ?
AMANDA: Just hold on .
GRANT: Jump ! Swim for the far shore !
ERIC: We have to keep looking for Dad . We have to .
AMANDA: I know . I know . I want to look for him too .
ERIC: then we should
AMANDA: Let me tell you a few things about you Dad ,
ERIC: He loves you too .
AMANDA: Okay . He loves us very very much . And I know that right now more than anything , your Dad would want to know that we 're safe . Okay ? Eric nods .
A VOICE: Listen to your mother .
PAUL: Good thing I 've been swimming , huh ?
ERIC: Yeah .
PAUL: That was a fun day . To Paul , after some consideration .
AMANDA: We should try fishing again .
PAUL: You mean it ?
AMANDA: I do . It 's worth another shot . And who knows ? Things might turn out differently .
ERIC: The lady you called , how do you know she can help us ?
GRANT: She 's the one person I could always count on . And she 's saved me more times than she ealizes . I owe her everything . A long beat as they walk .
ERIC: You should .
GRANT: You 're right .
ERIC: No . I could n't see .
GRANT: Do me a favor . Go back to your parents for a minute , would you ? They look worried .
ERIC: Mom ! Dad !
PAUL: Helicopters . Helicopters !
ERIC: Dr. Grant ! Helicopters are coming !
GRANT: No we 're not .
AMANDA: You have to go back ! We ca n't leave him !
GRANT: We have to cut it ! Find something sharp !
ERIC: What do you think is going to happen with the dinosaurs ?
GRANT: The population will Stabilize eventually . They 'll adapt to fit different roles .
PAUL: Either that , or the government will firebom it back to the Stone Age .
AMANDA: I would completely support that .
ERIC: I hope they do n't . I want to come back someday . And Dr. Grant realizes
GRANT: So do I .

MRS. BOWMAN: Cathy ! Do n't wander off ! Cathy keeps wandering . MRS . BOWMAN Cathy , come back ! You can look fo shells right here ! Cathy gestures , pretending she ca n't hear .
BOWMAN: Leave her alone .
MRS. BOWMAN: What about snakes ?
BOWMAN: There 's no snakes on a beach . Let her have fun , for once .
CATHY: Please be quiet , please be quiet please be quiet

CHAIRMAN: Thank you , John . Mr. Ludlow ?
LUDLOW: These pictures were taken in a hospital in Costa Rica forty-eight hours ago , after an American family on a yacht cruise stumbled onto Site B . The little girl will be fine , but her parents are wealthy , angry , and very fond of lawsuits . But that 's hardly new to us , is it ? Wrongful death settlements , partial list family of Donald Gennaro , 36.5 million dollars ; family of Robert Muldoon , 12.6 million . Damaged o destroyed equipment , 17.3 million . Demolition , de-construction , and disposal of Isla Nublar facilities , organic and inorganic , one hundred and twenty-six million dollars . The list goes on , gentlemen research funding , media payoffs . Silence is expensive . He 's warming up . Not a bad performer . LUDLOW This corporation has been bleeding from the throat for four years . You , our board of directors , have set patiently and listened to ecology lectures while Mr. Hammond signed your checks and spent your money . You have watched your stock drop from seventy-eight and a quarter to nineteen flat with no good and in sight . And all along , we have held a significant product asset that we could have safely harvested and displayed for profit . Enormous profit .
BOARD MEMBER: I second the motion , Mr. Chairman , Please poll the members by a show of hands .
CHAIRMAN: All those in favor of InGen Corporate Resolution 213C , please signify you approval by raising your right hand .
DIETER: Yeah .
MALCOLM: Shit .
MAN: You 're him , are n't you ?
MALCOLM: Excuse me ?
MAN: The guy . The scientist . I saw you on TV . I believed you .
MALCOLM: I was misquoted . I was merely speculating on the evolutionary scenario of a Lost World . I neve said I was in any such place .
BUTLER: Whom shall I tell Mr. Hammond is calling ?
MALCOLM: Ian Malcolm
BUTLER: Not an animal lover ?
MALCOLM: Not really .
HAMMOND: Ian ! Do n't linger in the doorway like an ingenue , come in , come in ! Malcolm steps further into the room . HAMMOND It 's good to see you . It really is . How 's the leg ?
MALCOLM: Resentful .
HAMMOND: When you have a lot of time to think , it 's funny who you remember . It 's the people who challenged you . It is the quality of our opponents that gives our accomplishments meaning . I never told you how sorry I was about what happened after we returned .
MALCOLM: I did n't know you were n't well .
HAMMOND: It 's the lawyers . The lawyers are finally killing me .
MALCOLM: They do have motives . Why did you want to see me ? Your message said it was urgent .
HAMMOND: You were right and I was wrong . There ! Did you ever think you 'd hea me say that ? Spectacularly wrong . Instead of observing those animals , I tried to control them . I squandered an opportunity and we still know next to nothing about their lives . Not their lives as man would have them , ehind electric fences , but in the wild . Behavior in their natural habitat , the impossible dream of any paleontologist . I could have had it , ut I let it slip away . Thank God for Site B .
MALCOLM: What ?
HAMMOND: Well ? Did n't it all seem a trifle compact to you ?
MALCOLM: What are you talking about ?
HAMMOND: The hatchery , in particular ? You know my initial yields had to be low , far less than one percent , that 's a thousand embryos for every single live birth . Genetic engineering on that scale implies a giant operation , not the spotless little laboratory I showed you .
MALCOLM: I do n't believe you .
HAMMOND: Isla Nublar was just a showroom , Ian , something for the tourists , Site B was the factory floor . We built it first , on Isla Sorna , eight-some miles from Nublar .
MALCOLM: No , no , no , no , no , no . . .
HAMMOND: After the accident at the park , a hurricane wiped out our facility on Site B . We had to evacuate and leave the animals to fend for themselves . And they did . For four years I 've fought to keep them safe from human meddling , now I want you to go there and document them .
MALCOLM: Are you out of your mind ? I still have nightmares , my reputation 's a joke , my leg is shot you think I need more of that ?
HAMMOND: It would be the most extraordinary living fossil record the world has ever seen .
MALCOLM: So what ?
HAMMOND: I 've been putting this together fo over a year .
MORE: I have personal suggestions for you entire team , phone numbers , contact people . They wo n't believe you about what they 're going to see , so do n't other trying to convince them . Just use my checkbook to get them there . I 'll fund your expedition through my personal accounts , as such money and equipment as you need , but only if you leave immediately . If we hesitate , all will be lost .
MALCOLM: John . . .
HAMMOND: You 'll need an animal behaviorist , someone with unimpeachable credentials . I believe you already know Sarah Harding . She 's got theories about parenting and nurturing among hunter/scavengers I et she 'd be dying to prove on a scale like this . If you convince he to go , it 'll be a major coup . When she publishes , the scientific community must take it seriously .
MALCOLM: I 'm not going , John .
HAMMOND: Ian , you are my last chance to give something of real value to the world . I ca n't walk so far and leave no footprints ; die and leave nothing with my name on it . I will not be known only for my failures . And you will not allow yourself to go down in history as a lunatic . You 're too smart . You ' e too proud . Dr. Malcolm . Please . This is a chance at redemption . For both of us . There 's no time to equivocate , we must seize it now , before
LUDLOW: Hello , Uncle John . Dr. Malcolm .
MALCOLM: Find someone else .
LUDLOW: So , you two were just , uh , telling old campfire stories , were you ?
MALCOLM: Do me a favor . Do n't pretend for a second that you and I do n't know the truth . You can convince Time magazine and the Skeptical Inquire of whatever you want , but I was there .
LUDLOW: You signed a non-disclosure agreement efore you went to the island that expressly forbade you from discussing anything you saw . You violated that agreement .
MALCOLM: You cost me my livelihood . That on which I relied to support my children .
LUDLOW: If your university felt you were causing it embarrassment by selling wild stories to Hard Copy , I hardly see how I am to
MALCOLM: I did n't tell anything , I told the truth .
LUDLOW: You version of it .
MALCOLM: There are no versions of the truth ! This is n't a corporate maneuver , it 's my life .
LUDLOW: We made a generous compensatory offe for your injuries .
MALCOLM: It was a payoff and an insult . InGen never
LUDLOW: InGen is my livelihood , Dr. Malcolm , and I will jealously defend its interests . People will know what I want them to know when I want them to know it .
MALCOLM: Do you have a satellite phone ?
ROLAND: Ajay ?
AJAY: How did you know ?
ROLAND: That cheap aftershave I send you every Christmas , you actually wea it . I 'm touched . Sit down , sit down , what brings you to Mombassa ?
AJAY: You . Tell me , Roland , when was the last time you answered your phone ?
ROLAND: Last time I plugged it in , I suppose . Why ?
AJAY: I got a call from a gentleman who 's going to Costa Rica , or thereabouts . If he 's to be believed , it 's a most , uh , unique expedition . And very well-funded .
ROLAND: Well , I 'm a very well-funded old son of a bitch . You go .
AJAY: But alone ? We always had great success together , you and I .
ROLAND: Just a little bit too much , I think .
AJAY: How do you mean ?
ROLAND: A true hunter does n't mind if the animal wins . If it escapes . But there were n't enough escapes from you and me , Ajay . I 've decided to spend a bit less time in the company of death . Maybe I just feel too close to it my
TOURIST: Is that supposed to be an insult ?
ROLAND: I can think of none greater . The Tourist looks at his Buddies and laughs .
TOURIST: Buzz off , you silly old bastard .
ROLAND: What do I have to do to pick a fight with you , bring your mother into it ?
TOURIST: Are you kidding ? I could take you with one arm tied down .
ROLAND: Really ?
TOURIST: I mean my arm .
ROLAND: Sorry . We were saying ?
AJAY: You broke that idiot 's jaw for no eason other than your boredom . Tell the truth , Roland . Are n't you even interested in knowing this expedition 's quarry ?
ROLAND: Ajay . Go on up to my ranch , take a look around the trophy room , and tell me what kind of quarry you think could possibly be of any interest to me . Ajay just smiles .
SARAH: Hyenas . Ace Face is the striped snout .
MAKENA: Closer ?
SARAH: No way .
MAKENA: But the view would
SARAH: No cliffs . F1 headed sough , F2 and F5 flanking , twenty yards . F3 center . F6 circling wide east . Ca n't see F7 .
MAKENA: Sarah .
SARAH: F8 circling north . F1 straight through , disrupting . Herd moving , stamping . There 's F7 . Straight through . F8 angling through from the north . She 's practically on top of the animals now .
MAKENA: Dr. Harding .
SARAH: Brooding behavior in evidence at the kill site , pups are ushered forward and adults help them eat , pulling flesh away from the carcass and A telephone rings .
MALCOLM: We leave in twenty-four hours . Five member team .
EDDIE: No , no , look at the plans , Henry , you ca n't place that strut laterally , it has to be crosswise , LOOK AT THE
WORKMAN: Sorry , Eddie ! Specs say it ca n't deform at 12,000 PSI , we had to test it
MALCOLM: Any damage ?
EDDIE: Minimal .
MALCOLM: `` Minimal '' is too much . It has to be light , it has to be strong
EDDIE: Light and strong , light and strong , sure , why not , it 's only impossible . God save me from academics .
MALCOLM: You are an academic .
EDDIE: Former academic . Now I actually make things . I do n't just talk .
MALCOLM: You think I 'm all talk , Eddie ?
EDDIE: It does n't matter what I think .
MALCOLM: Is there anything we 've forgotten ? Anything at all ?
KELLY: Hi , Dad .
MALCOLM: Kelly ! What are you doing here ?
KELLY: Vacation . I 'm all yours . You did n't forget , did you ? She pulls back and looks at him . KELLY Did you ?
MALCOLM: Okay , Karen is expecting you in half an hour . You only have to stay with her one night , she 'll put you on a us in the morning and your mothe will be at the station when you get there .
KELLY: I do n't even know this woman .
MALCOLM: Well , I do , and she 's fantastic . She 'll take you to the museum , maybe to a movie if you play your cards ight . You 're going to have a fantastic time .
KELLY: Stop saying fantastic . Where are you going ?
MALCOLM: I ca n't tell you . But I 'll be back within a week .
KELLY: My vacation is over in a week .
MALCOLM: I 'll make it up to you this summer . I promise .
KELLY: I 'm your daughter all the time , you know . Not just when it 's convenient .
MALCOLM: Very hurtful . Your mother tell you to say that ?
KELLY: No , Dad . I have thoughts of my own once in a while . From the construction floor , EDDIE calls out . EDDIE Dr. Malcolm !
MALCOLM: Is that kid still bothering you ?
KELLY: Which one ?
MALCOLM: You know , at the bus stop . With the hair ?
KELLY: That was about a year ago .
MALCOLM: Well , is he ?
KELLY: No . Richard talked to his parents .
MALCOLM: That Richard . EDDIE Ian , come here a minute !
KELLY: I could come with you .
MALCOLM: Out of the question . You 'd miss the gymnastics trials . You 've been training for that for a year .
KELLY: I do n't care about the trials , I want to be with you . I could be you esearch assistant , like I was in Austin .
MALCOLM: This is nothing like Austin . Forget about it .
KELLY: You like to have kids , you just do n't want to be with them , do you ?
MALCOLM: I 'm not like you wan me to be . I 've what I can be . He leaves .
JUTTISON: Could n't we just airlift into the island ?
MALCOLM: Dr. Harding insisted we go by sea ! Helicopters are too disruptive . These are n't piles of bones you 'll be studying this time , Dr. Juttson , they live , they breathe , and they react ! Juttson looks at him skeptically and throws up .
SARAH: So what 's your story , Nick ?
NICK: I was a cameraman for Nightline fo six years , been freelance since '91 . Do a lot of work for Greenpeace .
SARAH: That must be interesting . What drew you there ?
NICK: Women . 'Bout eighty percent female in Greenpeace .
SARAH: Very noble of you . You do n't think you 're bringing that thing onto the island , do you ? Nick grins and shuts it off .
NICK: Hey , I would n't want to spook the woolly mammoths .
SARAH: You think this is all a joke ?
NICK: Oh , please . How am I supposed to keep a straight face when Johnny Cash here tells me I 'm going to Skull Island ?
SARAH: Ian 's a very good friend of mine .
NICK: He does n't need a friend , he needs a shrink .
SARAH: I believe in him . But her face says even she has her doubts .
NICK: Come on , there 's only one reason any of us are here . His check cleared . She looks at him .
SARAH: Drop the cynical pose . You ca n't pull it off while playing Donkey Kong .
CAPTAIN: There it is !
MALCOLM: Be back in three days , but keep the satellite phone on and your radio tuned to the frequency I specified in case we need you sooner .
CAPTAIN: Do n't worry . I 've lived around here all my life , these islands are completely
MALCOLM: Listen . I know you all have probably concluded that I 'm out of my mind .
EDDIE: Lindstradt air rifle . Fires a subsonic Fluger impact-delivery dart .
MALCOLM: Is there an antidote ?
EDDIE: Like if you shoot yourself in the foot ? Would n't matter . You 'd be dead before you realized you 'd accidentally pulled the trigger .
NICK: Oh
JUTTSON: my
EDDIE: God !
SARAH: It 's beautiful !
JUTTSON: Stegosaurus , family Stegosauridae , infraorder Stegosauria , suborde Thyreophora . Length , adult male , estimate twenty-five to thirty feet .
SARAH: That was a pair bond ! A family group , even , long after that infant was nestbound !
JUTTSON: I want to see the nesting ground !
SARAH: Lone nest not colonial . I do n't see an egg clutch
JUTTSON: The empty shells are crushed and trampled . The young stay in the irth environment , that 's conclusive !
SARAH: Not without a shot of the nest .
NICK: She 's gutty .
MALCOLM: She 's nuts .
SARAH: Ian , you 're not insane ! I 'm so glad !
JUTTSON: Dr. Malcolm the world owes you an apology .
SARAH: No more smoking . We leave no scent of any kind . No hair tonics , no cologne , seal all our food in plastic ags . We will observe and document , ut we will not interact .
MALCOLM: That 's a scientific impossibility , you know . Heisenberg uncertainty principle . Whatever you study , you also change .
NICK: What should I call this ? `` Jurassic Pork ? '' Eddie , next to him , laughs .
SARAH: And let 's forget about the high hide . We ca n't do this kind of work up in a tower , we need to be out in the field , as close to the animals as possible .
JUTTSON: I 'm not surprised stegosaur lived in a family group , but there 's neve een anything in the fossil record to prove the carnivores did .
SARAH: Why would n't they ? Look at hyenas , jackals , nearly all species of predator birds
JUTTSON: That does n't say a thing about T-rex , they could have been rogues . Robert Burke certainly thinks they were .
SARAH: We 've got to see one to find out . Is there any
MALCOLM: No way .
NICK: Oh , my God .
SARAH: way we could safely
NICK: Oh , no !
EDDIE: Fire !
MALCOLM: A campfire ? !
SARAH: No ! Water mixes the smoke billow , use dirt !
MALCOLM: Who the hell started a campfire ? ! VOICE It was just to make lunch .
SARAH: What do you want to do , Ian , lock he up for curiosity ? Where do you think she gets it ?
JUTTSON: Do you have chromium tapes ? The others fog in high-
NICK: -humidity , I know . Highest lead density on the market .
EDDIE: We 've got a lot of heavy marching ahead of us . I 'm not carrying anybody .
KELLY: I can keep up .
MALCOLM: You 're going home . I 'm sending a adio call for the boats . We 'll all go down to the lagoon and wait fo them .
SARAH: Lighten up , Ian , you sound like a high school vice-principal .
MALCOLM: I 'm her father .
KELLY: Sure , now .
NICK: Do you see any family resemblance here ?
MALCOLM: You ca n't stay , Kelly , that 's it . It 's too dangerous .
SARAH: If it 's so dangerous , why 'd you bring any of us ?
KELLY: You 're wrong , Dad . I do know what 's going on on this island .
MALCOLM: How could you possibly ?
KELLY: Because you said so . Maybe nobody else believed you , but I always did .
NICK: The kid scores with cheap sentiment .
SARAH: Ian , if we recall the boat now , we 've made two invasive landings in one day . That 'll have to go in any pape I write , and it will leave room fo people to say our findings were contaminated . You know the academic world as well as I do , once they smell blood in the water , you 're dead . Our presence has got to be one hundred percent antiseptic . That means if we bend a blade of grass , we end it right back the way it-
NICK: You were saying something about antiseptic ?
LUDLOW: Welcome to your dream come true , Dr. Burke .
BURKE: I believe the large herbivores forage in open plains , like bison , which would explain the great variety of heat dots we 're reading in the flatlands around this waterhole . Right here .
LUDLOW: Then that 's where we 're going .
BURKE: Hadrosaurus ! Carinthosaurus ! Maiasaurus !
LUDLOW: This is as good a place as any fo ase camp . First priority is the laser barriers , I want them all up and running in thirty minutes . Half an hour , understand ?
ROLAND: Cancel that , Dieter .
LUDLOW: What ? Why ? Roland points to a stream running nearby .
ROLAND: Carnivores hunt near stream beds . Do you want to set up base camp or an all-you-can-eat people bar ?
LUDLOW: You heard his , Dieter . Find a new spot . And remember , we 're afte herbivores only no unnecessary isks .
ROLAND: Peter , if you want me to run you little camping trip , there are two conditions . First I 'm in charge , and when I 'm not around , Dieter is . Your job is to sign the checks , tell us we 're doing a good job , and open your case of scotch when we have a good day . Second condition my fee . You can keep it . All I want in exchange for my services is the right to hunt one of the tyrannosaurs . A male . Buck only . Why and how are my business . If you do n't like either of those conditions , you 're on your own . Go ahead and set up your camp right here , or in a swamp , or in the middle of a rex nest , for all I care . But I 've been on too many safaris with ich dentists to listen to any more suicidal ideas . Okay ?
LUDLOW: Okay .
ROLAND: Good lad .
BURKE: Pachycephalosaurus !
LUDLOW: Carnivore ?
BURKE: Huh ? No ! No , herbivore , late Cretaceous . Very unusual plant eater , see that distinctive domed skull ? That 's nine inches of solid one .
LUDLOW: Just get them out of the way , Dieter .
DIETER: COME ON , MOVE IT ! !
ROLAND: Dieter . This is a round-up , not a war . Use your powers of persuasion .
DIETER: Come on , come on , do n't have all day !
BURKE: See , the pachy 's neck attaches at the ottom of its skull instead of the ack of its head , as with reptiles .
AJAY: Roland .
BURKE: Which is perfect for absorbing impact .
AJAY: It matches the pictures .
ROLAND: It certainly does .
LUDLOW: Where do you think you 're going ? !
ROLAND: To collect my fee . And with that he disappears into the foliage .
AJAY: Do you wish to go where the animal has been , or where the animal is ?
EDDIE: Why did n't you tell us about these guys , Ian ? !
MALCOLM: Because I did n't know ! I do n't have the faintest idea what they 're doing here .
NICK: Ruining everything , that 's what they 're doing . You could choke on the diesel smoke already !
SARAH: Ian , nothing we observe will be valid if we 're trailing along in the wake of an army .
KELLY: `` InGen . '' What 's InGen ?
MALCOLM: Where does it say that ?
KELLY: On the side of that one truck .
JUTTSON: InGen is a genetics corporation , is n't it ?
NICK: Is that who we 're really working for ? ! Gene splicers ? !
MALCOLM: No ! We 're an independently funded expedition .
SARAH: Funded by whom ?
MALCOLM: John Hammond .
JUTTSON: But he 's the head of InGen !
NICK: You got ta be kidding . You dragged me out of Greenpeace to e a corporate stooge ? You could n't get anybody else ?
KELLY: Yeah , what have you done , Dad ?
SARAH: We 'd better keep moving , or we 'll lose them .
MALCOLM: What are you doing to me , John ?
ROLAND: It 's the rex nest .
AJAY: Make a blind here ? Wait for the buck to return ?
ROLAND: If the nest is upwind , so are we . When he comes back , he 'll know we 're here before we have a chance . The truck
HUNTER: LOOK AT THESE THINGS !
HUNTER 2: THEY 'RE BEAUTIFUL , MAN , THEY 'RE BEAUTIFUL ! ! !
DIETER: FASTER !
LUDLOW: Alive , Dieter , and uninjured !
DIETER: Turn that off !
DIETER: Easy easy not too close ! Full extension !
JUTTSON: Carinthosaurus compsognathus triceratops pachycephalosaurus or small scavengers only .
MALCOLM: Ludlow . That 's why Hammond was in such a hurry for me to get here . He knew they were coming .
SARAH: Heights , I ca n't help it . Put you arm here , will you ?
JUTTSON: What do they want ?
MALCOLM: They want their money back . To InGen , this island is nothing more than a bed investment .
JUTTSON: We should get back to base camp . Eddie 's waiting for us .
MALCOLM: I ca n't believe Peter Ludlow 's unning all this .
SARAH: He is n't . Check out the guy walking past the fire . She hands the binoculars to Malcolm .
MALCOLM: Well , if that 's true the man in charge just left camp .
NICK: Then this is our chance .
MALCOLM: Our chance to do what ?
NICK: I do n't know these guys , but I know 'em . I 've seen 'em on Japanese whalers , French barges trying to dump arrels of nuclear waste in the North Atlantic . They 're all the same . They spray us with water cannon when we try to stop 'em , sink our boats , and then call us crazy .
SARAH: Why , Nick . You are a tree-hugger . He looks at her , hurt .
NICK: There ' no reason for name calling .
MALCOLM: Dr. Juttson , please take Kelly back to camp right away . Leave the othe car for us and we 'll meet you there in an hour or so .
KELLY: What are you guys gon na do ?
MALCOLM: Exactly what John Hammond wanted us to do .
ROLAND: Offering a little incentive .
LUDLOW: What kind of gun is that ?
ROLAND: My father 's .600 Nitro Express . Made in 1904 . Karimojo Bell gave it to him after he took down his last elephant . 8700 foot pound striking force .
LUDLOW: How close do you have to be ?
ROLAND: Forty yards . Less , maybe . I assume it 'll take a slug in the brain case to bring him down .
LUDLOW: Why not just use a scope and a poison dart and snipe him from a hill ? Roland just looks at him .
ROLAND: Or a laser beam from a satellite ?
LUDLOW: You rally think this 'll draw the parent ?
ROLAND: I once saw a bull elephant die charging a jeep . All the jeep had done was startle the bull 's calves . I saw a lioness carry wounded prey four and a half miles , all the way ack to its den , just to teach its cubs how to finish off a kill .
LUDLOW: Killing lessons ? Heartwarming .
ROLAND: Rex wo n't be any different . It 'll come .
LUDLOW: You 're kidding yourself . An adult T-rex cares about one thing filling its own belly . It acts the way people wish they could , that 's why everyone 's fascinated by it . If people had the chance to see one dinosaur and one only , ninety-nine percent would He stops , an idea on his face . LUDLOW Wait . Why not ? Sedatives growth inhibitors
ROLAND: What ?
LUDLOW: I had n't planned on bringing carnivores back because of the liability risk , but I only thought of adults , it never occurred to me You are a billion dollar idea , my little f-
ROLAND: What the hell you do that for ? !
LUDLOW: Had to . To keep him still for the trip .
ROLAND: You 've broken its leg !
LUDLOW: We 've got to transport it seven thousand miles . Would you prefer it it off the leg of a crew member ?
NICK: Hang on . We may encounter some turbulence .
BURKE: If you 're really interested in infants , we 'll have better luck at the seaside , because the sands offe a cushioning surface where the egg clutches can can
ROLAND: What in God 's !
NICK: Sick bastards .
LUDLOW: What in Christ 's name is going on ? !
ROLAND: Is n't it obvious ?
SARAH: Nick , thank God , we did n't know if Malcolm opens the rear door .
NICK: Wait , do n't -
MALCOLM: HOLY SHIT ! !
ROLAND: Do we have anyone up there ?
MALCOLM: ? !
NICK: It has a broken leg !
MALCOLM: So do it a favor and put it out of its misery !
NICK: No ! Get in the car before they hea us !
SARAH: Ian , close the window , it 's going to wake every predator in the jungle !
JUTTSON: There they are !
EDDIE: What is that they have with them ?
MALCOLM: This is exceedingly unwise .
SARAH: Too late to worry about that ! Hold him together , Nick !
MALCOLM: Just do whatever you have to do and get it out of here as quickly as possible .
SARAH: Okay , there 's the metatarsals tibia , fibula there it is ! See it ? That 's a fracture , just above the epiphysis . They peer closely at the monitor .
NICK: That little black line ?
SARAH: That little black line means death for this infant . The fibula wo n't heal straight , so the ankle joint ca n't pivot when he stands on his hind feet . The baby wo n't be able to un , and probably ca n't even walk . It 'll be crippled , and a predato will pick it off before it gets more than a few weeks old .
MALCOLM: Can you set up ?
SARAH: It has to be temporary , something that 'll break apart and fall off as the animal grows
MALCOLM: Think fast , Sarah .
KELLY: What are they doing ? Why do n't they hurry ? !
EDDIE: Give me the radio .
NICK: Give it more morphine !
SARAH: We 'll kill it with too much , we 'll put it into respiratory arrest ! I 'm almost done . Damn it , I need another adhesive , something pliable I can
KELLY: What is it ?
EDDIE: Sarah , come in !
JUTTSON: It 's moving . Fast .
SARAH: Hold it down , Nick !
NICK: I 'm trying ! EDDIE Is anybody there ? !
SARAH: Ian , get the bottle of amoxicillin and fill a syringe ! Quick injection of antibiotics and I can get it out of here !
EDDIE: WE ESTIMATE TWO LARGE ADULTS HEADED IN YOUR DIRECTION ! I REPEAT
MALCOLM: Oh , Christ .
NICK: What do they want ? !
MALCOLM: What do you think they want ? !
SARAH: That 's impossible , they ca n't have the sensory equipment to track it all the way here !
MALCOLM: Current evidence seems to be to the contrary , would n't you say ? ! GIVE IT
SARAH: Ready ? Malcolm reaches for the door handle .
NICK: Wait !
SARAH: Born free , as free as the wind blows . As free as the grass grows
MALCOLM: Are you insane ? !
SARAH: I swear to God , it works with lions sometimes ! There we are your baby is free
EDDIE: They 're going back into the jungle .
KELLY: Uh huh .
MALCOLM: Wait there . I 'll come up in a minute . Do n't move , understand ? KELLY I understand .
SARAH: Note to Dr. Juttson Tyrannosaurus ex does nurture its young . They laugh weakly .
NICK: There 's , uh there 's an unwritten ule when a news crew is in a wa zone . You stop the van every two miles and decide whether or not to go on . Whether or not you feel lucky . One `` no '' from anybody in the group and you turn around right there , no question asked , nobody embarrassed . Well ? Do we go on ? Immediately
SARAH: No .
MALCOLM: No .
NICK: No way . They all laugh .
MALCOLM: All right . I 'm satisfied with the evidence we have right now . I feel vindicated . John Hammond will too . Do you have enough to publish ?
SARAH: They will come after me . But I can collect some stool samples , for DNA with that , Nick 's tapes , and the rest of you to back me up , it should stand when we get back .
MALCOLM: Then the only thing left to do is make sure we do get back . I 'll call the mainland on the satellite phone and have them send the boat ight now . This expedition is over .
NICK: HANG ON TO SOMETHING !
SARAH: They 're pushing us !
MALCOLM: Oh , God .
SARAH: What ? !
MALCOLM: They 're pushing us over the cliff .
NICK: SARAH ! DO N'T MOVE !
SARAH: OH GOD please
MALCOLM: Nick ! Grab the phone !
EDDIE: Hang on hang on
EDDIE: HEY ! HELLO ? !
MALCOLM: WE 'RE IN HERE ! GET SOME ROPE !
EDDIE: Catch !
SARAH: We 're sliding !
EDDIE: Climbs up if you can !
EDDIE: Damn it !
MALCOLM: Eddie ?
SARAH: Oh , God . Now what ?
MALCOLM: Are you all right ? ! Anything broken ?
KELLY: I 'm fine , I 'm fine , I was scared , I thought you , are you okay ? !
MALCOLM: I 'm fine I 'm fine
ROLAND: That 's what you think .
LUDLOW: Trespassing , sabotage you could go to jail just for being here , did you know that ?
SARAH: Do n't start a legal argument with me , this island is n't your property , and neither are these animals ! DR. JUTTSON has encountered DR. BURKE .
JUTTSON: What are you doing here , Burke ? There 's no TV cameras , what 's the point ?
BURKE: Dr. Juttson , you exist outside the classroom . I am amazed . Dieter continues to get in Nick 's face .
NICK: Are you looking for a problem ?
JUTTSON: Everyone , keep your voices down !
ROLAND: Back off , Dieter .
JUTTSON: Listen to me , by moving the baby ex into our camp , we changed the adults ' perceived territory !
LUDLOW: Their what ?
SARAH: Oh , God .
JUTTSON: That 's why they persisted in destroying the trailers , they now feel they have to defend this entire area ! We 're not safe here .
LUDLOW: Thanks to you people .
SARAH: Hey , we came here to observe , you came here to strip-mine the place ! It 's a looter mentality , all you care about is what you can take .
ROLAND: None of that matters . Ou communications equipment 's been destroyed . If your radio and satellite phone were in those trailers that went off the cliff , and I 'm guessing by the look on his face
SARAH: Move where ? Our boat 's not coming for two days , your airlift is waiting for an order you have no way to send
LUDLOW: There 's a communication center , here , in the old worker village . Hammond put in some kind of renewable powe source replenishing . It may still work . If we could get there , we could send a radio call for the airlift .
NICK: How far is the village ?
LUDLOW: I said if we could get there .
NICK: Well , how far is it ?
LUDLOW: A day 's walk , maybe more . That 's not the problem .
ROLAND: What is ?
LUDLOW: The velociraptors . Malcolm looks up sharply . LUDLOW Our infrareds show their nesting sites are concentrated in the island interior . That 's why we planned on keeping to the outer rim .
DIETER: What are velociraptors ?
JUTTSON: Carnivores . Pack hunters . About six feet long , three or four hundred pounds , and very , very fast . Dieter brandishes his weapon .
DIETER: I think we can handle ourselves against them .
MALCOLM: No . I 'm quite certain you ca n't .
ROLAND: Look , we have two choices . We can hike back down to the lagoon , where we can sit for two days , in the open , next to a heavily used water source while we 're waiting for your boat to arrive , or we can head for the village , where we might find some shelter and we can call for help .
MALCOLM: We 'd never make it past the raptors . Trust me , I have some experience in this matter . Roland looks at him .
ROLAND: That may be . But you were n't with me at the time .
MALCOLM: Damn it .
ROLAND: You all right ?
MALCOLM: You ever heard of Gambler 's Ruin ?
ROLAND: What 's that ?
MALCOLM: A statistical phenomenon . Says everything in the world goes in streaks . It 's real , you see it everywhere in weather , in rive flooding , in baseball , in blackjack , in stock markets . Once things go ad , they tend to stay bad . Bad things cluster . They go to hell together .
ROLAND: Feeling a bit blue , are we ?
MALCOLM: Just flawed . Very deeply flawed .
ROLAND: Why did you come here ?
MALCOLM: So that others would know about this place ?
ROLAND: Why should they ?
MALCOLM: Because it exists .
ROLAND: It 'll still exit if they go on not knowing , wo n't it ?
MALCOLM: Yes . And people will live in the absence of truth .
ROLAND: So the truth is more important to you than your life ?
MALCOLM: I do n't care about my life . But if I 'd ever thought for a second that she would be in danger
ROLAND: She yours ?
ROLAND: Somewhere on this island , there exits the greatest predator that ever lived . And the second greatest predator must take him down .
MALCOLM: But why ?
ROLAND: You remember that guy , about twenty years ago , I forget his name , but he climbed Everest without any oxygen , came down almost dead . And they asked him , `` why did you go up there to die ? '' And he said `` I did n't . I went up there to live . ''
MALCOLM: It 's called self-testing . But in your case , it sounds more like self-destruction . A uniquely human characteristic . In fact , human eings destroy things so well that I sometimes think that 's our function . Maybe every few sons , some animal comes along that kills off the rest of the world , clears the decks , and lets evolution proceed to his next phase . Maybe death and destruction are our job , maybe we 're supposed to destroy ourselves and every othe living thing that-
ROLAND: Tell you what . You can see whateve you want to , to me , but you will not spew any more nihilist rants at anyone else in the group . I 'm fighting panic , and you push the wrong buttons . Understand ? Malcolm just blinks . This guy 's in charge .
KELLY: I do n't think my dad does n't think we 're going to make it . Sarah looks at her .
SARAH: Your dad is wrong . About a lot more than he knows .
NICK: I think you should call a break .
ROLAND: Another half hour .
NICK: Some of them wo n't make another half hour . We did n't come this far to start dropping in the middle of the jungle . If you do n't call it , I will .
ROLAND: FIVE MINUTES BREAK !
JUTTSON: I ca n't believe you 're still angry about that .
BURKE: You know , it 's very easy to criticize the first person who studies something .
JUTTSON: No , it 's easy to criticize sloppy esearch and hasty conclusions .
SARAH: You know , even if we do get those tapes back , people are going to say it 's just another hoax . Ian Malcolm 's alien autopsy .
MALCOLM: Maybe . Maybe not .
SARAH: Ian , they will misplace our evidence , shoot holes in our testimony , and say some special effects genius created the animals . The only way people will ever believe that dinosaurs exist is if you dump a T-rex in the middle of times Square .
DIETER: Wait here for me , would ya Carter ?
ROLAND: Break 's over , move on !
CARTER: Seven , eight minutes . Roland looks at them , thinking . Finally
ROLAND: Then he 's dead . Nobody tells the little girl . Last thing we need is screaming hysterics .
SARAH: We have to send someone to look fo him !
ROLAND: You go if you like , but we 're not waiting for you . MOVE IT OUT ! !
MALCOLM: You okay ?
ROLAND: Looks like the worker village is down in there , about a mile and a half northeast from the base of these cliffs . MALCOLM is next to him .
MALCOLM: There must be a game trail , some kind of path that goes down there .
ROLAND: They 'll have to rest before we look for it . Eat . Sleep . Two hours . Then we hit it .
SARAH: There you are . Your dad 's looking for you .
KELLY: I doubt that .
SARAH: Oh , come on . Go talk to him .
KELLY: Why ? He likes to be alone . I can stay with you .
ROLAND: You hear something ?
AJAY: No . I feel something .
ROLAND: Oh , no .
MALCOLM: KELLY ? KEEEEELLLY ? !
ROLAND: MALCOLM ! OVER HERE !
NICK: SARAH KELLY COME HERE !
SARAH: WHAT ARE YOU-
NICK: JUMP !
BURKE: Get out of the way !
SARAH: STOP IT YOU 'RE PUSHED HER OUT STOP IT !
ROLAND: She 's okay ! They 'll stay in there , she 's okay !
AWAY: NO ! DO N'T GO INTO THE LONG GRASS !
ROLAND: Elephant grass !
HUNTER: They gave up ! They 're not chasing us !
ROLAND: How many rounds did you find for that weapon ?
MALCOLM: Four , counting the one in the chamber .
ROLAND: Do n't let it out of your hands again . Can the kid walk ?
SARAH: Ask her .
ROLAND: Can the kid walk ?
KELLY: I can . I can walk .
ROLAND: We 're going to find a path down into the interior of the island . Load up whatever you think you need , and I mean need . If you ca n't carry it indefinitely , do n't bring it . We 'll hit the worker village in a couple hours and be out of here before dawn .
LUDLOW: What is that ?
ROLAND: Piss . Ludlow does n't ask .
SARAH: God help us .
NICK: I do not feel lucky .
ROLAND: Keep moving .
LUDLOW: We made it ! They hurry over a small rise
MALCOLM: The jungle . It 's always ready to eturn . Roland catches up and looks at Ludlow .
ROLAND: Where 's the power and radio setup ?
LUDLOW: Operations building . Far end of the street .
NICK: Lava ?
MALCOLM: No .
NICK: What are they ?
MALCOLM: I do n't know .
LUDLOW: The radio rig is inside . It runs directly from the geothermal generator , so power should n't be a problem .
ROLAND: Good .
MALCOLM: What 's he got in there ?
LUDLOW: Piss .
SARAH: What ?
LUDLOW: Do n't ask me . The guy 's completely out to lunch .
NICK: What in God 's name would he want with- Roland rejoins them .
ROLAND: Tyrannosaur urine . I do n't want anything to do with it , and neithe does any other animal on this island . This building is now demarcated as the rex 's territory . As long as you stay in that building , you 'll all be safe until the helicopter comes .
JUTTSON: Where are you going ?
ROLAND: After the rex . I saw a fresh kill ack in the valley with tyrannosau tracks all around it . If I 'm not ack in time , do n't wait for me .
SARAH: You 've got to be kidding .
ROLAND: Runs against my nature to hole up in a cave and wait .
LUDLOW: Do you think the rex might have the infant with it ?
ROLAND: Possible . Ludlow takes off his hat and turns to Nick .
LUDLOW: You know how to work a radio , do n't you ?
SARAH: You 're going too ?
LUDLOW: I lost everything I came after on this trip , but one T-rex in one theme park could single-handedly bail InGen out of Chapter 11 .
MALCOLM: You gentlemen feel you have to do this now ?
ROLAND: Now 's the perfect time . The animal just fed , so it wo n't stalk us fo food . Predators do n't hurt when they 're not hungry .
NICK: No .
LUDLOW: We 're downwind . Good .
ROLAND: We took to the rock .
LUDLOW: Why ?
ROLAND: Wind shift .
LUDLOW: It 's behind us .
ROLAND: It 's just fed . It wo n't attack unless it 's threatened . Do n't move .
LUDLOW: If I do n't move , I ca n't shoot it .
ROLAND: Let it go , Peter . The animal won .
KELLY: What 's going on ? !
PILOT: There they are !
MALCOLM: There it is !
SARAH: Ian . It 's guano .
MALCOLM: What ?
SARAH: These formations . They 're dried
MALCOLM: Birdshit ?
NICK: Who cares ? Let 's go !
MALCOLM: Kelly ? ! KELLY ? !
NICK: Come on !
MALCOLM: Where 's Kelly ?
NICK: She 's with Sarah ! They race off , down the street .
MALCOLM: We ca n't stay in here !
NICK: We 're sure as hell not going back out there ''
MALCOLM: This is single-wall construction ! It 's just a shack !
NICK: It 'll hold !
MALCOLM: For sixty seconds , maybe ! Look at this ! You could-
NICK: Head for the roof !
MALCOLM: I have to find Kelly !
NICK: I think she 's with Sarah !
MALCOLM: DAMN IT , BE SURE ! !
NICK: Help me push this !
MALCOLM: Something 's wrong .
NICK: Look ! Sarah !
MALCOLM: SHE 'S ALONE ! !
KELLY: Dad !
MALCOLM: Come on !
NICK: Where 's Kelly ?
SARAH: Where 's Ian ?
MALCOLM: CLIMB !
KELLY: DAD , COME ON !
PILOT: LET 'S GO LET 'S GO LET 'S GO ! !
MALCOLM: KELLY !
ROLAND: Give me a ladder !
MALCOLM: GO GO GO GO GOG GO !
PILOT: We 're snagged on something !
SARAH: NO ! Do n't ! They 're not attacking !
MALCOLM: Thank you . Kelly , thank God . Thank God for you
LEX: I 'm glad you came , Dr. Malcolm
MALCOLM: I 'm sorry about your grandfather .
TIM: Thank you .
LEX: We were going to call you , in a few days . Tim and I have been thinking , and we 've decided we want people to know about the island . About what we all saw .
TIM: We think it 's something ou grandfather would want us to do .
MALCOLM: Why ?
LEX: Because it 's true . Malcolm looks at her for a long moment .
MALCOLM: I know , Lex . But even if we 're the only ones who ever know , it 'll still e true . You see , I 've decided that if the world found out about what your grandfather created , it would n't be around for very long .
LEX: But it was real . You ca n't let people go on saying it 's not .
MALCOLM: That 's the thing about reality . He looks down at Kelly . MALCOLM Even when people stop believing in it , it does n't go away .
