BURGEL: Kafka . Kafka turns to see BURGEL , a creep .
KAFKA: I gave it to him yesterday .
BURGEL: You did n't give it to me .
KAFKA: No , I left it in his office .
BURGEL: Did you see him ?
KAFKA: I 've never seen him . I do n't elieve there is a keeper of the files .
BURGEL: He 's usually in the storage room sorting things out . He ca n't close the file on a case until he has the concluding report .
KAFKA: He has it , he just has n't noticed it yet , all right ?
BURGEL: Who 's to say he ever will ? He 's a timid old man and quite careful not to tread on anyone 's toes In fact , I 'm the only one he trusts and he would n't even look at a document if it did n't first come through me .
KAFKA: Burgel , I thought it would be easier , as long as I was passing
BURGEL: But I 'm the messenger . An erro like this damages my credibility .
KAFKA: Your credibility yes , it 's well known .
BURGEL: When I deliver a message the very act of delivering it , you might say , gives it an official stamp , and only in this way are both the sender and the receiver satisfied that it was delivered at all .
KAFKA: I 'll commit that to memory .
BURGEL: Your position in this firm is not unassailable . He waddles away .
BIZARRE VOICE: Yes ?
KAFKA: I 'm sorry to disturb you I wonder if you know where my friend Eduard is ?
BIZARRE VOICE: I ca n't hear you ! You 'd bette come in .
KAFKA: I did n't want to bother you .
CONCIERGE: Well , you have . What do you want ?
KAFKA: My friend Eduard , I wonder if you 've seen him ? He has n't been in to work , I thought he might be ill .
KAFKA: You did n't have to get out of ed I could have taken the key .
CONCIERGE: Yes , I 'm sure you could . She treats him like dirt .
KAFKA: Well , he 's not here .
CONCIERGE: The manners of a tramp ! It 's my house , is n't it ?
KAFKA: Miss Rossmann ? GABRIELA looks around from a file cabinet .
GABRIELA: I know .
KAFKA: You 're a friend of Eduard Raban 's .
GABRIELA: Why would you suppose so ?
KAFKA: Oh well , I thought he once mentioned
GABRIELA: One of you must be mistaken .
KAFKA: I 'm sorry , but I just wondered
GABRIELA: Excuse me , I have to copy this fo Central Docketing by 2 30 .
BURGEL: You 're late I knew it would happen one day .
MARGARETE: This is our friend Anna who works with us on the magazine .
KAFKA: Hello .
ANNA: I 've been hearing all about you . Kafka cringes .
ERNST: Do n't worry , Kafka I championed your virtues .
KAFKA: I 'd like to hear them .
JULIUS: Anna 's new to the city we would n't frighten her needlessly .
KAFKA: I 've lived all my life in this city it frightens me . As it draws me closer into its web .
STELLA: This is an ancient lament .
KAFKA: No , but do you realize why ? it has no present .
ANNA: I 'm hoping to live in the Old Quarter .
KAFKA: Even the so-called New Town is n't so new . Only the people . People of the future living in buildings of the past . Has anyone seen Eduard ?
MARGARETE: Who ? My friend Eduard from the office I 've brought him here lots of times you used to marvel at his travel stories .
JULIUS: Oh , him .
KAFKA: What d'you mean , oh him ? He 's a perfectly nice person , he 's neve missed a day before .
ERNST: Perhaps he 's taken up with those traveling players you two were so fond of .
KAFKA: No , it 's me who always wanted to un away with them except that that life would be far too hectic for me . I 'm worried about him , no one 's seen him .
STELLA: Have n't you ever called in sick and gone roaming about , free of esponsibility to anyone , if only for a day ?
KAFKA: When you work for a medical firm you ca n't call in sick . They know malingerers like a dog knows fleas .
ANNA: You work in the insurance department ?
KAFKA: You have been hearing the sordid side then .
MARGARETE: Be pleased you constantly inspire people to take an interest in you life .
ANNA: I should think it 's very interesting work . Kafka shrugs shyly .
KAFKA: My father always said I had no ambition .
STELLA: The cabaret will be packed this time of night we 'll never get in .
JULIUS: Well , it has to be the cabaret ecause there 's nowhere else to go .
MARGARET: Home , I think .
JULIUS: Home ?
MARGARET: You know I ca n't stay up late .
VOICE: Home is the last resort
ERNST: Do you know Bizzlebek the gravedigger ?
BIZZLEBEK: Stonecutter , if you please .
MARGARETE: Sculptor , if only he 'd admit it .
BIZZLEBEK: No one should admit being an artist unless they 're paid for it . If you go to the cabaret mention my name they 'll find a table for you . Turning round again .
ERNST: Bizzlebek has ways and means denied lesser mortals . It comes from working in the cemetery all day he 's able to transcent the physical world .
BIZZLEBEK: No it only makes me view people dispassionately as so many slabs .
JULIUS: My God , look , he 's marching forward willingly to make human contact .
KAFKA: I 've never seen you here before .
GABRIELA: Have you looked ?
KAFKA: Well nice to know life exists outside the office .
GABRIELA: Yes .
KAFKA: No , really , I have to go home too .
MARGARETE: We 're keeping him from his true vocation .
JULIUS: I know , he consists of writing . We would n't be his friends if we did n't threaten his solitude !
KAFKA: Up there .
ANNA: I tried finding a place on Castle Hill when I arrived . I wanted to share the majesty .
KAFKA: It 's only majestic from here . When you get closer you see it for what it really is .
ANNA: What is it really ?
KAFKA: A glorified office block . They keep all the old records there the final resting place for facts and figures that have ceased to matter in the world of the living .
ANNA: Well , as long as I admire it from afar it should n't worry me if it 's hollow .
KAFKA: It 's more than hollow . It 's stillborn . For all its size it serves no purpose . It 's just there like death hovering over a breathing city .
MARGARETE: Do n't worry about your friend I 'm sure he 'll turn up .
ERNST: What are you working on , Kafka ?
KAFKA: I 'm writing a story about a man who wakes up one morning to find himself transformed into a giant insect .
BIZZLEBEK: I 've read your stories . They 're fantastic .
KAFKA: I do n't know what you could have ead .
BIZZLEBEK: Just what you 've published .
KAFKA: In magazines nobody reads .
BIZZLEBEK: I read the one about the penal colony .
KAFKA: Did you ?
BIZZLEBEK: The needles inscribing the judgement into the flesh of the man . Very good .
KAFKA: `` As Gregor Samsa awoke one morning from disturbing dreams he from unsettling dreams uneasy dreams Gregor Samsa Gregor ? '' Carl . George . Rudolf
SECOND MAN: You know him ?
KAFKA: Yes .
FIRST MAN: His name is Eduard Raban ?
KAFKA: Yes .
MAN: Inspector Grubach .
INSPECTOR: Kafka is that your real name ?
KAFKA: Yes . Yes , of course why would n't it be ?
INSPECTOR: When was the last time you saw Mr. Raban ?
KAFKA: Wednesday . We left the office together .
INSPECTOR: Did you go anywhere afterwards to have a drink perhaps ?
KAFKA: No , we said goodbye outside the uilding . He went off , as usual , toward his house .
INSPECTOR: Your office is the Workmen 's
KAFKA: Accident and Compensation Association .
INSPECTOR: Where you 've been employed fo seven years .
KAFKA: Eight and seven months .
INSPECTOR: Engaged in the manufacture and distribution of pills and so forth .
KAFKA: Well other departments are , yes .
INSPECTOR: Would you describe your relationship with the dead man as close ?
KAFKA: Yes . Since he came to the office , almost three years ago , we 've een quite good friends . How was Eduard
INSPECTOR: He was found in the River . Could he swim ?
KAFKA: I do n't know .
INSPECTOR: Was he depressed ?
KAFKA: No . He did n't seem to be . Do you think he drowned himself ?
INSPECTOR: Grown men do n't normally fall into the river , do they ?
KAFKA: No , I suppose not .
INSPECTOR: He might have had a drink or two , despite what you think .
KAFKA: Can I ask how you found me ?
INSPECTOR: His landlady knew of no othe friends to refer us to .
KAFKA: I do n't think he really had any . He had no family either .
INSPECTOR: We know that . Pause .
KAFKA: He was n't a lonely man , though .
INSPECTOR: What makes you think so ?
KAFKA: Just a perception .
INSPECTOR: I do n't usually involve myself with you people in the Old Quarte but the River runs its own course . It wo n't be the last time it deposits its unwanted debris on my doorstep . Pause .
KAFKA: Probably not .
INSPECTOR: Anyway , I 'd like you to reflect that in me you have I wo n't say a friend , because we 're complete fencers , of course from distinctly incompatible social classes but to some extent , shall we say , an interested third party .
KAFKA: I 'll bear that in mind .
INSPECTOR: Should you happen upon anything that might be relevant . He nods curtly at Kafka , and shuts his door .
CHIEF CLERK: Sit down , Kafka .
KAFKA: My social situation ?
CHIEF CLERK: You keep too much to yourself you 're a lone wolf . It makes me uneasy , and if it makes me uneasy I ca n't imagine the impression you make on lesser employees .
KAFKA: To do my work well , I have little time for
CHIEF CLERK: You must make the time . Where do you go off to in the lunch hour ?
KAFKA: I usually take lunch by the River .
CHIEF CLERK: It 's not healthy , Kafka not fo you and not for your workmates . At the annual dinner this month you again failed to make an appearance .
KAFKA: I did not realize it was obligatory .
CHIEF CLERK: Have you never wondered and I mention this only in passing why other clerks have advanced to more responsible positions while you , who have been here longer , have not ?
KAFKA: No , sir .
CHIEF CLERK: Attitude , Kafka . It does n't matte how well you do your work you still see it as something to be gotten on with rather than something to take an active interest in .
KAFKA: Well , I
CHIEF CLERK: Oh , I know you got along with that poor fellow what was his name ?
KAFKA: Eduard
CHIEF CLERK: Yes Raban but he was too much like you even more so perhaps . He was n't here as long as you , so I did n't know him as well ut I could see the influence he was having . I simply want you to be aware of this because you 'll be happier for it . Kafka merely nods , starts to get up .
KAFKA: In a small way .
CHIEF CLERK: You might find a more athletic hobby put some color in you cheeks . He returns to his paperwork . Kafka leaves .
BURGEL: Good morning Or should I say good afternoon ?
GABRIELA: Say what you like no one pays the least attention .
BURGEL: Oh , do n't they ? I think you underestimate my station in this office and overrate your own .
GABRIELA: Not today , Burgel . Send one of your memos , write up one of you communiques , but for God 's sake do n't bother me today .
BURGEL: It 's my place to offer advice , not yours and by advising the Chief Clerk of your unpunctuality it 's certainly not my situation that 's compromised , if that 's what you 're implying .
GABRIELA: You 're just doing your job .
BURGEL: It 's what I 'm paid to do .
GABRIELA: You 're detestable .
BURGEL: And you 're late !
KAFKA: My assistants , I presume .
ASSISTANTS: Yes that 's us .
KAFKA: I 'm Kafka .
LUDWIG: Ludwig .
OSKAR: Oskar .
KAFKA: You look like brothers .
ASSISTANTS: Yes we do .
KAFKA: Have you worked here long ?
ASSISTANTS: No , no , no quite a long time , yes .
KAFKA: Well , we 'd better move things from my old desk .
GABRIELA: Eduard and I had lunch togethe one day and you saw us . Kafka looks up at her . He nods .
KAFKA: On the Embankment .
GABRIELA: I was having an affair with Eduard . He did n't tell you ?
KAFKA: No .
GABRIELA: He would have . You were his best friend . A better friend than me .
KAFKA: I suspected that he well .
GABRIELA: What ?
KAFKA: That he was satisfied in that egard . I did n't want to pry .
GABRIELA: It 's not that we wanted to deceive anyone but you know how these things are looked upon at the office .
KAFKA: This morning it was suggested to me that my own sense of office fellowship could bear improving .
GABRIELA: As long as it 's on their terms . If your work and your private life do n't correspond to thei specifications you 're labelled a dangerous agitator with no ecourse whatsoever .
KAFKA: How long were you and Eduard
GABRIELA: Two or three months , that 's all . I seduced him .
GABRIELA: You know as well as I do that he did n't commit suicide . Kafka looks at her .
KAFKA: No , I do n't . I 'm amazed that anyone is able to bear life with any assurance at all .
GABRIELA: Eduard did n't see it as something that needed bearing .
KAFKA: The police would know the difference , would n't they ?
GABRIELA: Do you think people in the New Town care what happens over here ? This will always be the ghetto .
KAFKA: He was n't robbed . He was identified by his wallet .
GABRIELA: And you believe everything the authorities tell you .
KAFKA: When I have no reason to doubt .
GABRIELA: The very fact that they 're authorities should give you reason . People will do anything to protect their own interests . For all you know he was killed at the hands of the police .
KAFKA: What could he have done to warrant that ?
KAFKA: Tonight ?
GABRIELA: There are some people I 'd like you to meet . Can you come to the Musil district at eight o'clock ?
KAFKA: All right .
GABRIELA: You almost married recently , did n't you ?
KAFKA: Last year . I it was broken off .
GABRIELA: Eduard wanted to marry me .
KAFKA: And you ?
GABRIELA: I 'm suspicious of men who want to marry . I believe they think it 's the only thing that will make them equal to their fathers .
GABRIELA: You wo n't have any trouble finding it .
BEARDED ANARCHIST: We 'll save the introductions . We do n't know yet if you 're friend or foe .
KAFKA: Strangers make better foes than friends . Will you tell me who you are altogether , if not individually ?
POCKMARKED ANARCHIST: Heralds of a new age does that sound immodest ?
BEARDED ANARCHIST: You could say we represent the u > unofficial view of a well-ordered society .
KAFKA: Ah we 're back to the `` authorities '' you spoke of .
GABRIELA: They 're ubiquitous . What we try to do is make them a little less so .
BEARDED ANARCHIST: Quite a disturbance tonight , yes ? And perhaps you recall last month the explosion at the Municipal Courthouse that sent one of the examining magistrates to join the heavenly choir .
KAFKA: Was Eduard one of you ?
YOUTHFUL ANARCHIST: The last to join us , the first to leave us .
KAFKA: Why take me into your confidence ?
POCKMARKED ANARCHIST: That 's obvious , is n't it ? We have an opening for a new member . After a moment 's pause , Kafka stands up .
GABRIELA: I nominated you as a possible candidate . You were Eduard 's good friend . He read me some of you work .
KAFKA: I 've hardly published enough fo anyone to draw conclusions from .
GABRIELA: You strike me as a man with a defined notion of injustice a high concern for the lot of you fellow men . And yet you 're able to emain an outsider . With the concomitant air of superiority ?
BEARDED ANARCHIST: In short , a higher man . It 's what we want . It 's what we need .
KAFKA: The distance to my fellow man is for me quite a journey . As fo eing an outsider , it 's never been a matter of choice .
YOUTHFUL ANARCHIST: They may have instituted proceedings against you .
KAFKA: What proceedings ?
POCKMARKED ANARCHIST: Preliminary investigations may already e underway .
BEARDED ANARCHIST: You were his friend . One link is all they need .
GABRIELA: The day he died , Eduard was called up to the Castle . Did you know that ?
KAFKA: What of it ?
GABRIELA: He was summoned to help correct a minor discrepancy of some sort in the Medical Records Division . Apparently one of his claims was elevant .
POCKMARKED ANARCHIST: Merely in the interests of order , you understand . The officials at the Castle like to cover their tracks .
GABRIELA: He was never seen alive again .
KAFKA: And you still maintain what ? That he was murdered .
GABRIELA: He was murdered .
BEARDED ANARCHIST: As you can imagine , a pass into the Castle hardly ever granted was an opportunity we could n't ignore .
YOUTHFUL ANARCHIST: The Castle represents every anachronism that needs to be destroyed if progress is to be made .
BEARDED ANARCHIST: As you know , it 's not the most accessible location . Far from being depressed , Eduard was particularly excited when he brought us the news of this chance invitation . He set off that evening carrying one of ou custom-made briefcases instead of his own .
GABRIELA: You 're shocked at the thought of Eduard tossing a bomb through a window .
KAFKA: I have no right to be , I know . My experience with real life is practically nil .
GABRIELA: When you only see someone sitting at a desk all day , it 's liable to create a false impression .
KAFKA: People must think the same of me a quiet , dependable person .
BEARDED ANARCHIST: You do n't have to accept everything as true , my friend . You need only accept it as necessary .
GABRIELA: As the bomb never went off , we can only assume he was caught with it and summarily executed .
POCKMARKED ANARCHIST: Merely in the interests of order .
BEARDED ANARCHIST: The formality of a trial would be too costly for them . They 're beginning to understand that it 's the ensuing news of our actions that incites support .
KAFKA: Propaganda of the dead ?
YOUTHFUL ANARCHIST: The Castle will deny he was there any longer than his business required . They 're just file clerks up there . No doubt he was handed over to the police with the utmost discretion .
BEARDED ANARCHIST: In any event , we 've felt no epercussions as yet . Eduard must not have talked . You 're the one they contacted .
KAFKA: So that 's who my foes are policemen and file clerks . Law and order , you might say .
GABRIELA: You think what we 're doing is so wrong ? And what are you doing ? Pursuing goodness ? For what ? To answer to some supreme tribunal ?
KAFKA: My only concern is the human tribunal . Is n't it yours ?
GABRIELA: Yes which is why `` quiet , dependable people '' have to take charge of their own lives .
KAFKA: At the cost of others ? You accuse people of murder without trial apparently without irony . Did you go to the Castle with Eduard ? Then you have no idea what really might have happened that night at all even before or after he got there . He stands to leave again .
GABRIELA: Your human tribunal will betray you . Just as its members will be etrayed when they find no supreme one Kafka starts walking away .
KAFKA: How was your evening ?
ASSISTANTS: Fine terrible .
KAFKA: What was the matter with it ?
OSKAR: He ca n't sit still . Just when we arrive at a nightclub he wants to go to another one .
LUDWIG: You look tired .
OSKAR: Gabriela Rossman was here looking for you . Do you know her ?
KAFKA: Do you ?
OSKAR: We saw her naked once did n't we . He elbows Ludwig violently .
LUDWIG: Women are all you have on you mind !
OSKAR: She went to the roof to sunbathe one lunch hour we watched he changing .
KAFKA: I did n't realize you 'd been here that long .
OSKAR: You mean because it 's been a while since there was a sunny day ? What a good detective you are .
LUDWIG: They keep switching us from department to department . He does n't mind because he ca n't sit still .
OSKAR: We used to be in the supply section , carrying boxes of medicine about ut we dropped too many of them .
LUDWIG: It 's not too bad working here .
KAFKA: You do n't think it 's a horrible double life from which there is probably no escape but insanity ?
LUDWIG: No .
KAFKA: I 'm glad for you . He starts to go .
OSKAR: You should be content , you know !
BURGEL: Are you looking for Gabriela Rossmann ?
KAFKA: Yes .
GABRIELA: I 'm collecting Eduard 's things . If there 's anything you want , take it or I 'll give it to charity .
KAFKA: Burgel gave me this what does it mean ?
GABRIELA: Burgel ! I did n't leave it with him .
KAFKA: Why were you given notice ?
GABRIELA: They 're not obliged to tell .
KAFKA: It could n't be for that incident with Burgel the other day .
GABRIELA: Of course it could Burgel 's een trying to get me thrown out as long as I can remember . He < /u could 've killed Eduard .
KAFKA: You do n't believe that .
GABRIELA: I would n't put it past him .
KAFKA: It seems I knew Eduard a little it , after all .
CONCIERGE: Lodgers ! Not one of them thinks to spare me such spectacles !
GABRIELA: You might think I thought so myself at first that Burgel 's too insignificant to be dangerous . But that 's the very reason to beware ! It 's the small men to watch out fo the ones who substitute method for character .
KAFKA: Now you 've fallen into his trap . When he goes to bed at night Burgel dreams of inspiring as much fear in others as they inspire in him .
GABRIELA: It 's still easier for you to understand suicide , is n't it .
KAFKA: That street down there I always used to call it the approach oad for suicides . It leads straight down to the bridge and the River .
GABRIELA: Burgel hated Eduard . And me . I 'm sure he knew about us and I 'm sure it drove him mad .
KAFKA: Burgel does n't like anybody !
GABRIELA: He used to like me very much more than I liked him .
KAFKA: He 's jealous , yes , but that < /u jealous ? He 's too cautious .
GABRIELA: Of course he is the Castle precincts are not the safest part of the city after dark . People disappear up there regularly . If you want to lie in wait for someone , that 's the place to do it .
KAFKA: Now you 're saying Eduard was lured there ?
GABRIELA: How often does one of our clerks have business in the house of records ?
KAFKA: I 've heard of it happening .
GABRIELA: And Burgel is the bringer of messages , is n't he ?
KAFKA: Usually .
GABRIELA: Or what if there really was an error ? I do n't know what kind any kind that needed correcting and what if Burgel was responsible for it ? One mistake even a small one in a firm like ours it could cost him a promotion .
KAFKA: First these nameless authorities were the root of all evil , now it 's insignificant Burgel . If indeed there was a mistake and a mino one at that you 're suggesting someone went to a lot of trouble over something so trivial as to not matter at all .
GABRIELA: What seems important to these people is not determined by the amount of work it entails you 're far from understanding the authorities if you believe that .
KAFKA: Now Burgel 's one of the authorities ? She turns away from him , reddening .
GABRIELA: For all his big talk he is . Does he really have access to the Directors of the firm as he always claims ? or only the Deputy Managers people of no importance whatsoever . Someone ought to follow him for a change .
KAFKA: You wo n't make any sense of it while you 're upset . But she breaks away .
GABRIELA: Burgel is only there for one purpose to spy on the employees and report any and all indiscretions , eal or imagined . If he did n't send Eduard to the Castle , you can e damn sure he 's in league with whoever greeted him there . All those bastards are in league with each other why ca n't you see that !
KAFKA: I do n't see anything . I see a message on its way to me with all the right answers . Only it never arrives it 's always just on its way .
GABRIELA: Eduard
INSPECTOR: You said she was extremely upset . People who are extremely upset Kafka are given to disappearing in a hurry . They go and calm down for a day or so and then they come ack . They 've come to the door to the stairs now .
KAFKA: But that 's just my point she was more than upset , she was livid . She slammed every door on her way downstairs except that one . I was just behind her and I did n't even hear that one shut not at all .
INSPECTOR: That 's not what I call conclusive evidence of an abduction .
KAFKA: If someone was waiting here in the hallway to spirit her away , would n't they have shut the door as quietly as possible ?
INSPECTOR: Why would someone want to kidnap this woman the name is Rossmann ?
KAFKA: You told me to contact you if anything relevant came up Gabriela is relevant . When I spoke to you before I did n't know she 'd been seeing Eduard .
INSPECTOR: That 's been noted . But where does it lead us ? Unless you have something more to add .
KAFKA: She 's missing . I went to her house and she had n't returned there .
INSPECTOR: She lost her job today . Just etween you and me , I 'd probably go away and brood a bit myself . He signals his men , time for them to go .
KAFKA: Maybe it 's true then what she said .
INSPECTOR: What did she say ?
KAFKA: That the police may have allegiance to something other than truth .
INSPECTOR: I 'm going to say something , and I hope it 's quite clear because I wo n't be repeating it .
BIZZLEBEK: Where are your friends ? Kafka turns and looks at him .
KAFKA: Good question . Who are my friends would also be of interest .
KAFKA: Gabriela was right it 's easier for me to understand suicide . I 'm a practicing suicide .
BIZZLEBEK: In what sense ?
KAFKA: Bachelorhood is just the slow form . The bachelor does n't sew seeds . Only the moment matters . The space he occupies grows smaller and smaller until the only space right for him is his coffin . Pause .
BIZZLEBEK: These strange stories you write they come naturally , do they ?
KAFKA: Naturally ? that 's not the word I would have chosen .
BIZZLEBEK: Where do you get your ideas ? Only joking I 'm just joking . Let 's go to a brothel then , Kafka , come on .
KAFKA: I have n't got the energy . I mean , I have to conserve my energy .
BIZZLEBEK: Why do you work in that hideous insurance office ? dealing with people who fall off ladders . Now take me I make my living as a stone mason . It 's not my art ut it 's the tools of my art . You could be a journalist .
KAFKA: That would be even worse it would e a compromise .
BIZZLEBEK: Success or nothing ?
KAFKA: No not even success . My writing is not for making a living it 's for living . Not for other people , it 's for me .
BEARDED ANARCHIST: We have another theory .
POCKMARKED ANARCHIST: We may have attached too little importance to the reason Eduard was summoned to the Castle to begin with .
YOUTHFUL ANARCHIST: To correct a small discrepancy , you may recall .
POCKMARKED ANARCHIST: Ah , but what if it was n't ?
BEARDED ANARCHIST: Small .
YOUTHFUL ANARCHIST: What if it was a large < /u discrepancy ?
POCKMARKED ANARCHIST: Yours is a very powerful and important firm it has a lot at stake .
BEARDED ANARCHIST: Perhaps Eduard was closer than he knew to discovering it and so had to e silenced .
YOUTHFUL ANARCHIST: Or he was even more an innocent victim than that he was chosen to ear the blame if the crime was uncovered by anyone else .
POCKMARKED ANARCHIST: The crime so scandalous that the poor young clerk committed suicide ather than own up to it .
KAFKA: That 's mad .
POCKMARKED ANARCHIST: Oh , yes , it 's mad .
KAFKA: You said so yourself the firm is large and powerful . If the discrepancy really was something ig , Eduard 's responsibility would still have to be small . No poo young clerk could find himself in such a fix .
POCKMARKED ANARCHIST: When a scapegoat is needed , my friend
BEARDED ANARCHIST: We have to know what he was working on at the time of his death .
KAFKA: He worked on routine claims . His visit to the Castle was probably as minor a mission as he said it was .
POCKMARKED ANARCHIST: Why are you so aggressively unimaginative ? Eduard is no longe the only casualty .
KAFKA: Then why have n't I been
YOUTHFUL ANARCHIST: Kidnapped or murdered ? Because u > your connection with Eduard was u > obvious and above board not as easily misconstrued .
BEARDED ANARCHIST: Not secretive , therefore not suspicious .
POCKMARKED ANARCHIST: Gabriela , on the other hand , had made an enemy of this man Burgel .
KAFKA: Oh , Burgel ! Gabriela was having an affair with Eduard . They were both members of this group . If any crime 's been discovered and people are paying for it , I 'd look to u > yourselves !
POCKMARKED ANARCHIST: The loyal civil servant . I suppose you 'll deny that shortchanging the workers to whom compensation is due is standard company policy .
BEARDED ANARCHIST: It would n't surprise us if the discrepancy was between medicines sent and medicines received .
YOUTHFUL ANARCHIST: People die for such discrepancies .
SOLEMN ANARCHIST: We must have a look at Eduard 's file . cut
KEEPER: `` Raban '' that 'll be nearly at the back of the alphabet .
KAFKA: It usually is .
KEEPER: I 'm not obliged to give you access , you know not without authorization ut I 'll make an exception this one time .
KAFKA: Yes . Is n't it there ?
KEEPER: Wait a minute . `` Raban ? '' Where have I heard that name ?
KAFKA: He 's the clerk who died last week . From the insurance department
KEEPER: Why would we keep files on dead < /u employees ? All old files are sent up to the Castle . Do you think we have room for two hundred years worth personnel records ?
KAFKA: It 's gone out so quickly ?
KEEPER: Whenever an employee departs , shall we say , it 's up to the head of his department to requisition his file , eassign any outstanding claims , and send it off .
KAFKA: You mean my Chief has it .
CHIEF CLERK: I do .
KAFKA: I wonder if I might look to see if there 's an address for family I thought I 'd like to write to them .
CHIEF CLERK: No just as I thought no entry for family . Kafka nods a bit , wondering what to do now .
KAFKA: No I just I feel a sense of obligation . He was my friend if I can be of any help closing his affairs .
CHIEF CLERK: No , there 's only one report to complete . I 'll be doing it myself and submitting it to the Castle today or tomorrow .
KAFKA: I see it 's just the Erlange claim then .
CHIEF CLERK: The Orlac claim .
KAFKA: Sorry , yes well thank you , sir .
CHIEF CLERK: Kafka . Kafka reluctantly turns .
KAFKA: Yes , sir .
CHIEF CLERK: Give it up . He goes back to his paperwork . Kafka leaves .
KEEPER: If it was Accounts you wanted why did you ask for Employees ?
KAFKA: Orlac is an account ?
KEEPER: It 's a factory in the northern mountains . One of our best customers . Without a proper request I 'm not obliged to do this , you understand but I 'll make an exception on this one occasion .
KEEPER: At least the account is current even if the employee is n't .
KAFKA: All these in the last year ?
KEEPER: You must have read about it in the papers there was a terrible cave-in . It would n't have been so ad , but even the Medical Office for the district was killed !
KAFKA: I did read that . They gave him a posthumous medal .
KEEPER: Dr. Murnau was the bravest of men . He spent an entire career in those ackwaters with no regard fo personal gain . A great loss .
KAFKA: This is the cross-reference of clerks who 've worked on Orlac claims ?
KEEPER: Is your friend 's name among them ? Then he only worked on the one case . Your Chief will send me the final summation when he 's finished with it .
KAFKA: Once a file 's been sent to the Caste , is it possible to recall it for review ?
KEEPER: Of course not . Only by a Directo of the firm . Who 'd want to let in all kinds of riff-raff off the streets ?
KAFKA: What good are records if they 're not open for public inspection ?
KEEPER: These laws have been with us fo centuries how can you doubt them ?
KAFKA: What if I petitioned one of the Directors ?
KEEPER: You do not summon them they summon you and this , of course , hardly ever happens , if at all . The Directors are an eccentric lot and by nature cautious .
KAFKA: Where do our records go to in the Castle ?
KEEPER: We 're a medical firm , are n't we ? They go to the Medical Records Section .
KAFKA: I could always apply there .
KEEPER: It so happens , my dear simple sir , that the Head of Medical Records at the Castle is one of the Directors of this firm .
KAFKA: Do you mind !
OSKAR: I was just trying to finish some work !
KAFKA: You mean you 've actually begun some ?
LUDWIG: Just because he 's done nothing today , he does n't want me to show him up !
KAFKA: My assistants ! You might as well have fallen from the sky for all the thought that was spent in choosing you !
OSKAR: It 's not our fault . We 're naturally nervous .
LUDWIG: And we 're upset too .
KAFKA: What 's the matter with you ?
OSKAR: I ca n't make a simple statement without him taking issue with it
KAFKA: You should meet my father .
LUDWIG: We 've been together too long . His personality is overflowing into mine and vice versa .
OSKAR: How would you like to be in a horrible situation like that ?
WOMAN: Well , what 're you waiting for ?
MR. PICK: That 's it it 's all right you 've done very well .
KAFKA'S VOICE: `` oh , and thank you for the suit from Father , although I do n't know why he did n't simply return it . If it 's too small for him why do you immediately suppose it will fit me ? Your son Your loving son Your somewhat loving son You occasionally loving son You incapable-of-loving son You absolutely-bored-to-death-with-any- kind-of-family-life son ``
KAFKA: Help ! HELP !
VOICE: Did you think you 'd be safe back in your little burrow ?
OTHER VOICE: No matter how deep a hole you dig for yourself , the beast will always find you .
OSKAR: We 're to take you to the Castle . Kafka might have expected this .
KAFKA: So . You 're the guides up there . And we thought it was Burgel .
LUDWIG: They would n't let Burgel into the Castle . You should look upon this as a great favor .
KAFKA: I do n't want any favors from the Castle just my rights .
LUDWIG: We answer directly to Ekman , the Senior Partner he practically uns the Castle . In a case like this you 're better off dealing with the highest authority even though it 's equally futile .
OSKAR: When you speak to him you have to lean quite near his right ea ecause the left does n't work so well .
KAFKA: For all your incompetence I was eginning to think you were at least loyal to me . You 're very good ham actors .
OSKAR: Just doing our job .
KAFKA: It 's a farce .
LUDWIG: We think you 'd better accept you position instead of pointlessly annoying us .
KAFKA: What position ? Being prosecuted in a case like this means having already lost it .
OSKAR: Still , we 're probably closer to you at the moment than any of you fellow human beings .
KAFKA: Close only by virtue of antithesis .
KAFKA: My assistants . I should have known . Nothing is given to me . I have to acquire everything .
OSKAR: It 's all right to be sarcastic in private to us because we have a sense of humor but when we 're up at the Castle we suggest you do n't make a fuss . It would spoil the not unfavorable impression you make in other respects .
LUDWIG: Frankly , we do n't understand why you 've even bothered pursuing this usiness .
KAFKA: It would be more accurate to say that it has pursued me .
OSKAR: But your goal is so hard to reach . Do you think the official network would surrender to one man ? We would never think of attempting anything remotely as difficult .
LUDWIG: My mother used to tell us of the young man who decided to ride to the next village and how she was afraid that not even mentioning accidents the span of a normal happy life might fall far short of the time needed for such a trip . Kafka suddenly points at the ground .
KAFKA: You 've dropped some money .
BIZZLEBEK: A man must eat And drink .
KAFKA: The Castle cemetery .
BIZZLEBEK: Are you sure you would n't prefe going through official channels ?
KAFKA: Official channels a lot of good they 've done me . My only hope is to approach the officials personally .
BIZZLEBEK: I 'm flattered , of course , to be considered a friend even without knowing all the details . To see such determination is eward enough for me .
KAFKA: The Kafka men are famous for it , you know . Delivering meat barefoot in the depths of winter , picking up sacks of flour with their teeth
BIZZLEBEK: There is one thing I 'd like you to tell me .
KAFKA: I 'm trying to find things out myself that 's the whole point .
BIZZLEBEK: What made you think I 'd be able to get you into the Castle ?
KAFKA: The cemetery is nearer the Castle than anywhere else was n't it part of the Castle originally ? I always assumed there 'd be a gate o something . Is n't there ?
BIZZLEBEK: In a manner of speaking .
KAFKA: An empty tomb ?
BIZZLEBEK: A cenotaph a monument to someone whose remains ended up elsewhere . But look
KAFKA: Not a chance . I 'm the thinnest person I know .
KAFKA: You appreciate my writing .
BIZZLEBEK: Yes .
KAFKA: Will you do me a favor then ?
BIZZLEBEK: Another one ?
KAFKA: If I do n't see you later go to my house and find my notebooks and destroy them . All my manuscripts just burn them . Please .
BIZZLEBEK: What an extraordinary request !
KAFKA: It 's my last and final one .
BIZZLEBEK: Then its authority is in doubt .
KAFKA: A true friend would do it .
BIZZLEBEK: Not necessarily . A wife would .
GAUNT MAN: You 've killed him ! Like a dog !
KAFKA: I did n't
GAUNT MAN: You 'll incriminate the rest of us ! Let me out too !
HORRIBLE VOICES: Help us ! release us !
GAUNT MAN: You 're in the bowels now , my friend ! You 've thrown yourself in it now !
MR. PICK: You !
FRIENDLY CLERK: Are you lost ?
KAFKA: I 'm , uh , looking for the Medical Records Section . Pause .
FRIENDLY CLERK: Oh , you 're miles away . From here you 'll want to go left , left again , ight , right again , left then right , ight then left , and take the Blue Staircase .
KAFKA: Thank you .
FRIENDLY CLERK: I have n't seen you here before .
KAFKA: No
MURNAU: I assume you 're wondering what all this has been about . Kafka tries to see into the shadows .
KAFKA: Are you the Head of Medical Records ?
MURNAU: He 's come on his own initiative . Not something we encourage , mind you , but we like to know it exists . And he 's stood up .
KAFKA: A piece of paper
MURNAU: A mere slip . Your friend Mr. Raban dealt only with claims that came in , anothe department being responsible fo compensation that goes out this is correct ?
KAFKA: A piece of paper
MURNAU: You see , Kafka , in all cases elating to the factory at Orlac which is what this paper referred to the authority that puts in a equest and the authority that grants it is , to all intents and purposes , the same authority .
MURNAU: You seem amused .
KAFKA: It only amuses me in that it gives me an insight into the ludicrous bungling that in some circumstances may decide the life of a human being . Ekman sighs as if at a difficult child .
MURNAU: It 's merely a matter of expediency . It 's imperative that my room to maneuver not e hindered by bureaucratic amifications .
KAFKA: `` Accident and Compensation '' no one can accuse the firm of not supplying exactly what it promises .
MURNAU: I believe we 've exceeded his expectations .
KAFKA: I had the grandest of financial plots in mind , the most malevolent of personal motives , conspiracy theories extending to every authority I could see . And I find you . A body snatcher . Murnau laughs .
MURNAU: Life is more than a Chinese puzzle , my friend .
KAFKA: And I suppose Dr. Murnau did n't die in a cave-in . You killed him to free the Position of Orlac Medical Officer for you own ends .
MURNAU: Yes , well we 're looking fo a new village now . If we stay too long at one source people ecome suspicious .
MURNAU: May I ask where your two warders are ?
KAFKA: Lying in the gutter where they belong .
MURNAU: Pity . They 're an amusing pair , did n't you find ? Absolute innocents . He pushes the tall door open into his lab .
MURNAU: I so rarely get the chance of showing my work to anybody anybody capable of appreciating it , that is . You might say I 'm a student of human reaction .
KAFKA: The fact that it 's live bodies you practice your trade on does n't seem to matter to you .
MURNAU: On the contrary , it matters a great deal . We 're engaged in immensely important research here . I 'm a revolutionary too , you know but a much more pragmatic one .
MURNAU: And the new patients they ing me are n't usually as dexterous as you 've been in evading us . Not perfect specimens by any means , but not the type of person who 'll e missed either .
KAFKA: What have you done with Gabriela Rossmann ?
MURNAU: As a matter of fact you 've caught us in a state of considerable excitement . Ou latest preparation we believe we pray is perfected . It should take years off her .
LUDWIG: Oskar !
OSKAR: Ludwig ? But Ludwig just pulls out a file folder .
LUDWIG: This is filed incorrectly !
OSKAR: Here too ! They 're all in a dreadful muddle !
KAFKA: Gabriela ! you did get away .
GABRIELA: I knew you walked this way to work . I wanted to find you efore they did .
KAFKA: I 've just come from the Castle . It 's over .
GABRIELA: Over ? It 's only over when you can crawl to a clean little spot on earth where the sun sometimes shines and you can warm yourself a bit .
KAFKA: Gabriela ?
GABRIELA: Should I tell you why I joined our late lamented nihilists ? Why I became a murderer ? Because murder is bliss . It 's easier than you might think to absorb and assimilate Evil once you 've adopted its procedure .
KAFKA: I I found your jailer .
GABRIELA: This is the result of thei elixir of youth . They were to come and check on it during the night . I contrived to miss the appointment .
KAFKA: They 're dead now . We can get help .
GABRIELA: I know how they reward failure . If they saw this I 'd be rotting in the quarries by the afternoon with all the others .
KAFKA: There 's a new potion he said it was perfected .
GABRIELA: I know there is . And you 're what I have to bargain with . For now you 're the last one in their way .
KAFKA: I told you , they 're dead . It 's finished .
GABRIELA: Why should I believe a man who never believed me ? They 're absolutely right , you know guilt should never be doubted . It 's easier that way .
KAFKA: No not this time .
GABRIELA: I know better than you what people will say when they have to . When they brought me in for questioning I informed on my friends the very first day .
KAFKA: Listen to me
GABRIELA: I do . Always . You understand the world better than any of us , Kafka . And what it 's ecoming . I 've always held you in the highest regard .
KAFKA: Gabriela !
KAFKA'S VOICE: Dearest Father
LUDWIG: We could go back to the office . Explain ourselves to the Chief Clerk .
OSKAR: They 'd drive us away . That Kafka 's made things very hot for us .
LUDWIG: I understand he was wounded in the lung .
OSKAR: It does n't matter . It 's too late for all of us .
LUDWIG: What 's to become of us now ? Oskar has a long think .
OSKAR: Amerika . That 's the place to go .
LUDWIG: Everyone in Amerika has a toaster in their building ! Oskar jumps down from the box .
OSKAR: Then that 's the place for us !
LUDWIG: Amerika for us !
OSKAR: Amerika !
BRIAN: Her father worked the night shift here . Most nights he 'd bring he with him . She was eleven years old .
DRIVER: Damn ! This defroster never works
BRIAN: This is where she murdered her first victim . They found his body over in the corner , shot through the head .
DRIVER: sure .
BRIAN: She lured them here with the promise of sex . Imagine the anger and hatred she must have felt returning to this place . Did she use that to help he pull the trigger ?
CARRIE: Shhhhhhhhh .
DRIVER: nothing .
BRIAN: Dead .
CARL: Man or woman ?
BRIAN: Man .
CLAUDIA: Real or fictional .
BRIAN: Real .
CARRIE: Ted Bundy .
CLAUDIA: What a guess !
CARL: Does n't count , she 's disqualified .
CARRIE: Why ?
CARL: Because you 've been living with him , and his thesis for the last year and a half . He 's probably been researching Ted Bundy all week .
PETER: Carl , you are the world 's worst loser !
CAROL: Any word from that gallery ?
CARRIE: Not yet .
CAROL: Nervous ?
CARRIE: Apprehensive . Let 's not forget these are the people who banned the Mapplethorpe show . Anyway , California 's loaded with galleries .
CAROL: You mean 'Ted Bundy 's ' finally agreed to leave ?
CARRIE: Soon as he finishes his thesis .
CAROL: Listen , Eric 's been `` finishing '' his for over three years now .
CARRIE: Yeah , well Brian 's got 'til the end of the summer , then I 'm outta here .
CAROL: I 'm sorry , but I just ca n't see you veggin ' out in LA-LA LAND .
CARRIE: Oh , I do n't know I think that once I dye my hair blonde , buy a string bikini and cultivate that tan I could be veggin ' out with the best of 'em Like fer shurr ! Carrie and Carol share a strained laugh .
BRIAN: I 'm talking about the mind and culpability of a serial killer . Someone who has no ability to distinguish between right and wrong should not be imprisoned , let alone executed .
ERIC: Oh , here we go again . Let 's just lay it all at the altar of misfiring synapses , amok biochemicals and horrendous childhoods .
BRIAN: Look , it 's a fact , most of these people suffer from a severe chemical ain imbalance . That enough Tequila ?
ERIC: Probably not Brian pours in the rest of the bottle .
BRIAN: The answer is research and treatment under hospital supervised conditions , not the electric chair !
PETER: Yeah , until it 's your mother 's head they find in the refrigerator .
BRIAN: Executing the killer would n't bring my mother back .
CARRIE: Thank god !
BRIAN: Ha , ha .
ERIC: Yeah , but it 'd sure make you feel etter , would n't it ?
BRIAN: No , it would n't make me feel better . Peter finds triple sec in the refrigerator .
PETER: Looking for this ?
CARRIE: If I have to listen to one more `` tweed '' talk about his dissertation , I 'm going to throw up .
ERIC: Label it anyway you want , the bottom line is these people are evil , plain and simple .
BRIAN: Okay , now you want to talk about good versus evil ? Well then let 's start with Adam and Eve and the snake .
CARRIE: Who do I have to blow to get out of here ?
BRIAN: A I got ta go .
EARLY: Coffee and a bowl of chili , please .
OLD MAN: The Antichrist 'll be a woman , in a man 's body . Seven heads and seven tails .
EARLY: Make that to go .
EARLY: Size 6 .
ADELE: Early , you are so sweet .
EARLY: Well Dorothy , why do n't you hand me that chili there .
BRIAN: Tonight turned out to be pretty interesting .
CARRIE: The party ? She grabs a leather cap that sits on a chair .
BRIAN: The warehouse . I 'm not that drunk .
CARRIE: It was definitely the high point of the evening . Carrie 's dress falls to the floor .
BRIAN: Just being there where it really happened . It was different more visceral .
CARRIE: Mmm I love it when you talk like that .
ADELE: You thirsty Lucy ?
ADELE: Bet that feels good , do n't it ?
NEWSCASTER: This was the third such attack in the past month and while an extensive police operation is underway no arrests have yet been made .
ADELE: Early
EARLY: He said that , huh ? Cursed in front of you ? Adele nods .
ADELE: You gon na talk to him ? Early gets in his car .
EARLY: If he comes back , do n't answer the door . Early revs the raspy engine .
ADELE: Suppose he hears me inside ?
BRIAN: I picked up some Chinese . Did you hear from the gallery ?
CARRIE: Yeah , same old shit . Too graphic not suitable for mass consumption one of those I forget . Who cares .
BRIAN: I do .
CARRIE: Then you can write anywhere . Let 's get out of here , while we still can .
BRIAN: Carrie , come on we can leave anytime we
CARRIE: No we ca n't . We can never leave once you start talking about tenure and vacation pay and parking privileges and oh shit ! let 's just go to California now , right now , before it 's too late .
BRIAN: just like that ?
CARRIE: Just like that . Load up the Lincoln point it West stop when we hit the fucking ocean .
BRIAN: These are great .
EARLY: Adele , who 's car 's that out
PAROLE OFFICER: She 's not here .
EARLY: What are you doin ' here ? I ai n't supposed to be at the Parole Office 'til tomorrow , two o'clock .
PAROLE OFFICER: Social call .
EARLY: Was n't my fault He lifts his crudely bandaged middle finger .
PAROLE OFFICER: Yeah Well you never have been 'treated right ' Have you ? Your father was pickin ' on you when he threw you out of the house fo stealing the tires off his truck . The Marines misunderstood you when they gave you that dishonorable discharge .
EARLY: I ai n't got nothing against God . It 's the people he let come into the world lot of them should have een stopped at the door . What are you looking for ?
PAROLE OFFICER: That girlfriend of yours ai n't much for housekeeping , is she . Early dismisses the place with a glance .
EARLY: I 'm thinking about moving
PAROLE OFFICER: What are you talking about ? You know you ca n't leave the state . What you can do is get a job .
EARLY: What is it ?
PAROLE OFFICER: Janitor 's job .
EARLY: Oh man come on , I do n't want no janitor job .
PAROLE OFFICER: Hey , I do n't give two shits about what you want or do n't want I 'm telling you to be there Friday , three o'clock sharp or the sheriff will be here for dinner . You understand ?
EARLY: You oughta think about putting a bag over your head Might cure them hiccups .
BRIAN: Hey . I did n't have the heart to wake you .
CARRIE: Thanks . What are you doing ?
BRIAN: Well , I sat down with my tapes and your photographs , which are great by the way and I started writing .
CARRIE: So how 's it going ?
BRIAN: I think it 's the best stuff I 've done .
CARRIE: Why ?
BRIAN: Because I was there . And for a moment that night I understood how she came to pull the trigger .
CARRIE: This mean your finally going to finish your thesis ?
BRIAN: Look , fuck the thesis . I think there 's a book here . Your photographs and my esearch , together .
CARRIE: A book on the warehouse murders ?
BRIAN: A book on some of the most infamous murderers in America . I want to go to where they lived and where they killed and I want you to photograph it .
CARRIE: It 's about fucking time , Kessler ! I 'd just about given up on you .
BRIAN: We do n't have enough money , but we 'll figure something out . Carrie steps up to Brian .
DIEBOLD: Hold on a minute there boy !
EARLY: Shit !
DIEBOLD: Goddamit , you 're gon na settle up that rent here and now .
CAROL: You know , they say one of these days Brian glances over his shoulder .
BRIAN: the whole thing 's going to slide into the ocean Yeah , I know .
CAROL: `` Looking for someone to take turns at the wheel and share expenses on a week long cross country blue- highways tour of historic murde sites '' You got ta be kidding . Who in thei ight mind would want to do that ?
BRIAN: I would . Brian smiles at her and walks away .
CAROL: Like I said She shakes her head .
EARLY: Where 's the personnel office at ? Carol turns to see Early .
RITA: First door on the left .
ADELE: Early ?
EARLY: What 's up Adele ? Dinner ready ?
ADELE: Almost .
EARLY: Well for one thing They think faster out there , on account of all that warm weather they got ; cold weather makes people stupid , that 's a fact .
ADELE: I guess that 'd explain why there 's so many stupid people around here .
EARLY: Yeah , and in California you neve have to buy fruit 'cause it 's all on the trees everywhere you turn and , 'course there ai n't no speed limit out there , and all drugs are legal And I heard your first month 's rent is free ; state law . I figure 'til we get settled we can just move around month to month
ADELE: What 'll we do out there ?
EARLY: Well the very first thing we 're gon na do is get us a couple of six packs of Lucky Lager and clim up on toppa ' that famous Hollywood sign and howl at the moon
ADELE: You know I read once Ai n't nothin ' on that big old moon 'cept some old golf balls those astronauts left behind .
EARLY: Bull . That ai n't right Government sends people there all the time , just do n't want us to know about it .
ADELE: Do n't be long now , dinner 's 'bout eady .
EARLY: I heard that .
CARRIE: What did he sound like on the phone ?
BRIAN: Real polite . Kept calling me 'sir . '
CARRIE: I still think we should have met them first .
BRIAN: Beggars ca n't be choosers . They were the only ones who answered the ride share note , remember ?
CARRIE: Please God , we 're gon na be stuck with these people for a week , do n't let them be as boring as Brian 's friends . Anything but that .
BRIAN: Oh , yeah He had a real thick accent ight outta `` Deliverance . '' `` Still ? Who said anything about a still ? Get ya ass up in them woods ! ''
CARRIE: Funny , very funny .
BRIAN: `` Aintry ? This river do n't go to Aintry . ''
ADELE: We should n't be doin ' this , Early . You leavin ' the state , ridin ' around with strangers besides , what kinda people would want to stop at places where other people was murdered .
EARLY: They ai n't dangerous Adele . They 're writers .
ADELE: Early Grayce ! She kneels down to pick things up .
EARLY: Yeah I left him with the car We 're all squared up now .
EARLY: What 's this ? He angrily reaches in and grabs it .
ADELE: Early ! She reaches for the cactus but misses .
EARLY: What kind of a person would carry a cactus in her purse !
CARRIE: You 've got to be kidding me , they look like Okies ! Brian honks the horn , Early waves back .
BRIAN: Lighten up
ADELE: Geez , they look kinda weird .
EARLY: You just smile , let me do all the talking .
ADELE: How many times you gon na tell me that ?
EARLY: As many times as it takes .
BRIAN: Hi I 'm Brian Early , and you must e Adele .
ADELE: Hi , I 'm Adele .
CARRIE: Carrie . She turns away from the window
ADELE: I like your hair . Carrie turns back , rolls down window
CARRIE: Pardon ?
ADELE: I said , I like your hair .
CARRIE: Thank you .
BRIAN: Tight fit .
EARLY: Best kind .
BRIAN: Uh , we can stop somewhere if you and Adele have n't had time for breakfast , Early .
EARLY: Well , it 's like this , Mr. Kessler .
BRIAN: Brian .
EARLY: Well , it 's like this , Bri ' . I do n't eat much in the mornin ' , never have . Maybe a beer once in a while ; Lucky Lager 's my favorite .
ADELE: It 's because of what he read in a ook once That folks needin ' eakfast is a myth , or whatever , put out by those cereal people .
BRIAN: So what do you do Early ?
EARLY: Oh I do some work up at the Merrick Mirror factory , or I used to
ADELE: One night we figured out how much ad luck he must have comin ' from all them mirrors he broke Four hundred and ninety four years to work it all off After he dies , he 'll have to keep coming back to earth over and over and over
CARRIE: Karma .
ADELE: What ?
CARRIE: Karma You know , if you do something bad to somebody fate will pay you back by something bad happening to you .
ADELE: That French ai n't it ?
BRIAN: So Adele , did Early happen to mention the places we 'll be stopping at ?
EARLY: Yeah Bri ' I did . Adele leans against Carrie 's front seat .
ADELE: Are you takin ' the pictures ?
CARRIE: Yeah .
ADELE: Is it hard to learn ?
CARRIE: Not really . Early pulls Adele back toward the back seat .
EARLY: You gon na talk to the people who did those murders ?
BRIAN: That 's a good idea . Unfortunately most of them have been executed .
EARLY: Too bad .
PAROLE OFFICER: What happened ?
POLICE OFFICER: Who are you ?
PAROLE OFFICER: His Parole Officer .
POLICE OFFICER: Right , I talked to you on the phone . They say it 's a torch job , that sound like your boy ?
PAROLE OFFICER: Could be .
POLICE OFFICER: Where would we find him ?
PAROLE OFFICER: Hell if I know , crazy son of a bitch said he was thinking of moving to Texas .
POLICE OFFICER: Without his car ?
PAROLE OFFICER: No , but I can tell you he 's not gon na e too happy about this .
POLICE OFFICER: That 'd be my guess .
PAROLE OFFICER: Looks like somebody cut off his ring finger .
POLICE OFFICER: Well now I 'd say that 's the least of Mr. Diebold 's problems .
ADELE: Thank you .
EARLY: All right , who gets the water .
BRIAN: How much do I owe you ?
EARLY: Forget it .
ADELE: Guess I do n't know the first thing about cameras .
CARRIE: Well , the first thing is you need film . Preferably black and white .
ADELE: You would n't have any color film , would ya ?
CARRIE: Yeah , sure .
ADELE: I like things in color , pink , purple , and red . I dunno , black and white is kinda boring .
CARRIE: You just aim and press the button . Adele takes the camera .
ADELE: Look , Pigeon Forge !
ADELE: I 've heard of that ! It 's where Dolly Parton has her park . `` Dollywood '' . I just think that 's so clever . Hollywood . Dollywood . Get it ?
EARLY: Shush , Adele .
ADELE: Early , can we stop there just fo a little while .
BRIAN: The Novaks are all gone but the fence that Michael Zaruba was hired to put up is still here .
ADELE: Hey you two .
BRIAN: Neighbors said he was a quiet young man , who was often seen pushing the children on the swing set .
GIRL: Pa ! There 's more of them .
BRIAN: Hi , my name is Brian Kessler .
FARMER: Goddamned ghouls
BRIAN: We could have been in and out of there in less than ten minutes
CARRIE: Hey , I got some great stuff it 's okay .
BRIAN: That house is part of American history now , whether he likes it o not . They enter the car .
EARLY: Forget about it Bri ' . I would n't be surprised if that Karma thing do n't come back and get him .
BRIAN: Well we 've come three hundred miles so far . Not a bad day 's haul .
EARLY: Nope You ?
ADELE: Well , least we got each other . That 's somethin ' .
EARLY: Thanks Bri ' , I 'll get the next one . Think it 's time we hit the sack .
ADELE: Sweet dreams .
CARRIE: You mean because I object to having somebody take off their shoe and scratch their foot while I 'm eating I 'm prejudiced ?
BRIAN: He ca n't help the way he was raised . I kinda feel sorry for him .
CARRIE: Feel sorry for him ? Obviously you did n't get a whiff of that sock ?
BRIAN: I heard that .
EARLY: Can you believe thirty bucks fo this room for what ? A lumpy mattress , that crummy TV and a crapper .
ADELE: Hey can we go to that Chinese estaurant when we get to Los Angeles ? You know , to see all them famous footprints ?
EARLY: Only if they let me put mine down too .
BRIAN: And all I 'm saying is I think we ought to try and get along with them . That 's all .
CARRIE: You try , I 'm gon na pretend they 're with somebody else .
BRIAN: Carrie .
CARRIE: I do n't want to talk about it .
BRIAN: He did n't stiff us . He paid for the gas remember .
CARRIE: I 'm telling you he 's nearly broke and we 're going to end up paying fo those two .
BRIAN: You finished ?
CARRIE: Um , maybe maybe not .
BRIAN: Morning Early lifts his beer bottle in salute .
EARLY: Bri ' .
CARRIE: Where 's Adele ?
EARLY: She was n't feeling so good .
WAITRESS: Breakfast ?
EARLY: Nah Do n't eat breakfast . Neve have . The Waitress notices Early 's bottle of beer .
WAITRESS: Ah sir sir . She gets Early 's attention .
EARLY: Well do n't be , I got plenty more where this one came from .
CARRIE: You cut your hair .
ADELE: Early cut it . Once he gets an idea in his head there 's no holding him back .
BRIAN: Nice job Early .
EARLY: Need a hand with those bags ?
CARRIE: No , thanks , I can manage .
EARLY: I got 'em .
CARRIE: Fuck !
BRIAN: Take your time .
EARLY: This the book your writing ?
BRIAN: It 's just a work in progress , kinda ough .
EARLY: This guy killed a mess of people .
BRIAN: Who ?
EARLY: Henry Lucas .
BRIAN: Henry Lee Lucas . Well he was only convicted of killing eleven but he claimed to have killed over three hundred .
EARLY: Wonder what all them people done made him so mad ? Brian looks to Early in his rear-view mirror .
BRIAN: He almost always killed strangers . Spent years moving on from one place to another . That made it real hard to track him down .
CARRIE: You dropped this .
ADELE: Early Grayce if this ai n't your lucky day .
BRIAN: I guess it 's your turn to pay Early .
ADELE: I used to smoke before I met Early . But he broke me of that . Her remark gets Carrie 's attention .
CARRIE: Broke you ?
ADELE: Early do n't think women should smoke or curse or drink liquor .
CARRIE: So you do n't do any of those things .
ADELE: Better not , or Early 'd whip me .
CARRIE: He whips you ?
EARLY: Hey Bri ' ah You do n't want to go in there . It 's a real mess , if you know what I mean .
BRIAN: That bad ?
EARLY: Then some .
ATTENDANT: Comes to twenty eight dollars .
CARRIE: Talk to him .
EARLY: Call it an even thirty .
ADELE: Hey you 're good . Thought you said you never played before ?
CARRIE: I have n't I 'm a fast learner .
EARLY: They never caught that Black Dolya Killer , huh ?
BRIAN: Dahlia , no .
EARLY: Now why is that ?
BRIAN: Some people think it 's because he never killed again . He just disappeared back into society .
EARLY: You do n't sound too convinced 'bout that ?
BRIAN: I always thought it was the work of a serial killer . Anyone who took that much time and care bisecting another human being must have been enjoying it and would have done it again . And again . Until someone stopped him .
EARLY: That your `` theory '' , ai n't that what they call it ?
BRIAN: Yeah .
EARLY: You wan na hear mine ?
BRIAN: Sure .
EARLY: Ai n't you goin ' to record it ? Brian picks up his tape recorder .
BRIAN: Early Grayce , June twenty third .
EARLY: Well I 'll just bet he 's still alive . Old , livin ' in some trailer park o somethin ' somewhere , but still alive . Thinkin ' every night 'bout what he done . Goin ' over and over it in his mind . How smart he was for getting away with it .
ADELE: You lose !
BRIAN: I suppose anything 's possible .
EARLY: You ever play any pool Bri ' ?
CARRIE: Do n't forget your key . She hands Brian the key .
BRIAN: Why 'd I open my big mouth ? Brian takes the key and walks to the car .
CARRIE: Why did n't you go with them ? The Lincoln pulls away .
ADELE: I told you how Early feels 'bout a woman drinking .
CARRIE: How 'd you meet Early ?
ADELE: I was hitchhiking ' one day and he picked me up . At first I was n't gon na get in on account of his car was in such sorry shape . I said , `` I ai n't never seen a white man drivin ' a ca like this . ''
CARRIE: You know I can fix that haircut fo you , if you want ?
ADELE: You can ?
EARLY: I wonder if there 's any `` doors '' out here ?
BRIAN: By the way , I 'm not much of a pool player .
EARLY: Shit , it ai n't hard to play pool . I can teach you everything ya need ta know .
BRIAN: Yeah ?

BRIAN: Wait a minute . You 're gon na hustle me ?
EARLY: Nah how much money have you got ? They both laugh and enter the bar .
ADELE: How do you get your cigarette to stay there like that . Carrie looks in the mirror .
CARRIE: I 'm cool .
ADELE: Could I try that ?
CARRIE: It 's a portfolio of my work .
ADELE: Your pictures . Can I see 'em ?
CARRIE: Sure .
ADELE: Jesus !
CARRIE: Took 'em all .
ADELE: No it is not !
CARRIE: Hold still .
ADELE: Sorry . Boy I 'll tell ya , if Early found a picture of me like that I 'd e black and blue for a week .
CARRIE: You should n't let him do that to you
ADELE: Do what ?
CARRIE: Adele are you serious ?
ADELE: You think Early 's bad to me , do n't you ?
CARRIE: Yeah . Carrie starts cutting Adele 's hair again .
ADELE: Well You 're wrong . I ai n't saying Early ai n't never hit me but he never hurt me .
WAITRESS: Maybe when you grow up a little sonny .
BRIAN: These are n't Lucky Lager , I ordered Lucky Lager .
WAITRESS: Sorry honey , 'ai n't nothin Lucky around here .
YOUNG CRACKER: What did you say to her city boy ! The Young Cracker is obviously very drunk .
BRIAN: Nothing , I jus
YOUNG CRACKER: What 's a jism gargling cum drunk fairy like you looking at a pretty girl like that for anyway ?
EARLY: You 'd better hit him first Bri ' , 'cos it 's comin ' .
YOUNG CRACKER: This yur ' boyfriend ?
BRIAN: What ?
EARLY: Hit him . Early looks at the beer .
YOUNG CRACKER: Hey Asshole !
BRIAN: They do n't stock it here Early .
YOUNG CRACKER: Why you fuckin '
WAITRESS: Sorry about that , he 's always causing trouble .
ADELE: My momma 's a beautician . Guess that 's where I get it from . She would n't hear of my moving in with Early on account of his just getting out of jail and all . Ai n't seen her in nearly a year now . I wish she 'd call me , just once .
CARRIE: What 's Early been in jail for ?
ADELE: Carryin ' a gun .
CARRIE: Anything else ?
ADELE: An ' resistin ' arrest At least that 's what the Police said .
CARRIE: Jeez Adele !
ADELE: I 'd better be goin ' . It 's late . Adele hastily weaves her way out the door .
CARRIE: Great .
EARLY: Got to see a man about a mule . Brian looks at Early , does n't understand .
BRIAN: Last one . Early stares at the last of the Lucky Lagers .
EARLY: Well I probably drunk more than my share , anyway you go on an ' have it .
BRIAN: No , it 's all yours . It 's on me for saving my ass back there . Early takes the beer .
EARLY: Hey , that 's what buddies are for , ight ?
BRIAN: What were you `` swinging a sickle '' for ?
EARLY: For 'bout three years .
BRIAN: Got ta see a man about a mule What 's wrong ? A few seconds pass .
CARRIE: The same thing that 's been `` wrong '' the whole trip . Your good buddy Early .
BRIAN: Who said he 's my good buddy ?
CARRIE: You sure been acting like you were Out whoopin ' it up , a drankin ' and ever ' thang .
BRIAN: Hey come on , you two were drinking too so what 's the big deal .
CARRIE: Yeah , and you should 've seen how terrified she was that he 'd find out . He beats her .
BRIAN: How do you know that ?
CARRIE: She told me but only when she `` deserves '' it . Did you know he was in jail ?
BRIAN: Yeah , for stealing a car . Aaahhhh . Suddenly , from right behind him
CARRIE: He told her it was for carrying a gun , but the truth could be murde for all we know . No response from Brian . Carrie walks away .
BRIAN: Stop being so fucking melodramatic ! If it was murder he 'd still be locked up or on parole , in which case he would n't be allowed to leave the state .
CARRIE: Maybe he was n't allowed to leave ! Geezus Brian !
BRIAN: Of course ! The accent , the clothes , and those table manners ! He 's got to be a mass murderer ! What else could he be ?
CARRIE: Try not to lose consciousness 'til I get back .
EARLY: Ai n't you done enough drinking fo tonight ?
CARRIE: Brian hurt his foot .
EARLY: Sometimes Do n't know why it is I get so hot I ca n't stand it . I just start sweating like a dog . You ever get like that ?
CARRIE: No .
EARLY: I can feel it start to run down my neck and down my back right into my pants .
CARRIE: I got ta get back before this ice melts .
EARLY: never ?
CARRIE: No , never . Excuse me .
EARLY: You like Skynard ? No response , Early chews up the ice cube .
ADELE: My daddy always took sauerkraut juice and tobasco sauce for a hangover , mixed in one egg not two , and some tomato juice
BRIAN: I 'm okay , thanks .
CARRIE: Look again !
EARLY: Only thing my old man ever gave me is that goddamn .45 . Brian fires off another shot , misses again .
ADELE: Boys 'll be boys .
EARLY: Steady Breath in now let half of it out , and fire .
CARRIE: Siesta .
CARRIE: What 's that ?
BRIAN: A copy of a tape they found . He ecorded everything .
CARRIE: I 'm finished . Carrie stops to pick up the rest of her gear .
BRIAN: Look I know you 're pissed off about the gun , and I do n't blame you Carrie wheels around to face him .
CARRIE: Brian , I 'm not pissed off . God damm it , turn that thing off . She switches off the cassette player .
BRIAN: Okay , it was a cheap thrill , it was stupid , I admit it , alright ? But let 's not blow this . Not now Let 's just get the photos .
CARRIE: I ca n't believe I agreed to do this .
BRIAN: Oh come on , do n't give me that shit you wanted to take these photos as much as I wanted you too .
CARRIE: Wrong ! I was willing to do whateve it took to get you up off your ass and on the way to California There 's a big difference .
CARRIE: Brian I want him out of our car !
BRIAN: Why , what did he do ?
CARRIE: Brian get him out of the car . Next gas station either he leaves or I do !

BRIAN: Sorry 'bout this Early . o.s . BANG ! ! rings out as
LEOPOLD: You dance like a herd of cattle , Miss Fairchild . You are a rare woman who lights up the room simply by leaving it .
UNCLE OTTO: Tell me Leopold , do you plan to join us downstairs after completing this one-sided flash of wit ?
LEOPOLD: I despise affairs of this sort , Uncle Otto . No one really listens to anyone else . If you attempt it , you will see why .
UNCLE OTTO: You judge everything too severely . I wonder what would happen if you were to cast that critical eye inward ?
LEOPOLD: You do not wonder at all . You merely ask in order to state your own opinion .
UNCLE OTTO: We are all concerned about you .
LEOPOLD: Ahh , here it comes .
UNCLE OTTO: Your life does not seem to have any direction . At the age of 25 a man is too young to do anything well . At 35 he is too old . Now is your time to take action . Tell me , what is it you want to DO with your life ?
LEOPOLD: I do not know .
UNCLE OTTO: Your ignorance cramps my conversation . Wake up ! This is your one and only life . Every man has the chance to make a difference . DO something !
LEOPOLD: I am most grateful for you surveillance and for your sympathy . I assure you there is no need fo concern . I am as effectual and attentive as my position allows .
UNCLE OTTO: Life is not position , Leopold . It is action . I will see you downstairs promptly . In the appropriate frame of mind .
THE VALET: Go spread joy .
LEOPOLD: You dance like an angel , Miss Fairchild . You light up the room . I thank you .
CARLSON: Julia Carlson . Leopold takes her hand and kisses it gently .
LEOPOLD: You are not from the area , are you ?
CARLSON: Are you ?
LEOPOLD: This is my estate .
CARLSON: Really ? Well it 's not home but it 's much
LEOPOLD: Shocking ! The TA-RA-RA-BOOM-DE-AY .
CARLSON: The ? Oh , that 's from Paris , is n't it ?
LEOPOLD: It is a scandal nonetheless .
CARLSON: I 'm afraid I 'm not much of a dancer .
LEOPOLD: Truly I would be in your debt . Any admonition would be erased simply by presenting a partner as lovely as yourself .
CARLSON: No , no . Really , I
LEOPOLD: I suppose we really ought to sing along .
CARLSON: Oh , golly .
LEOPOLD: Not at all . It was most enlightening .
CARLSON: I really must be going .
LEOPOLD: I wo n't hear of it .
CARLSON: No , I 'm quite late as it is .
LEOPOLD: I shall see you to the door
CARLSON: You 're very sweet . I had a wonderful time . Goodbye .
LEOPOLD: Miss Carlson ?
CARLSON: What are you ? You frightened me .
LEOPOLD: What sort of mechanism is this ?
CARLSON: It 's perfectly all right . It 's
LEOPOLD: What is this ? Who are you ?
CARLSON: Oh , God .
LEOPOLD: Miss Carlson I
CARLSON: No ! ! ! The compartment door snaps shut .
DR. KAU: Shit ! ! She turns to her co-workers , warning them .
DR. DRAKE: Good God !
DR. PLODDER: Everybody stay calm Lock the front door .
DR. KAU: He could be hurt , or even dead .
DR. PLODDER: All right . Touch him .
DR. KAU: But I 'm stuck and it 's only a dance and he IS the seventh Duke of Albany
DR. DRAKE: Carlson !
DR. PLODDER: Give me a minute
DR. KAU: Shit !
KATE: Who 's upset ? People fall in love , they have to climb back out . So , what ? We 'll just be friends now , Right ?
DR. PLODDER: She 's back .
KATE: That 's impossible ! She was n't supposed to return until
DR. PLODDER: Kate . It 's Carlson . Something went wrong .
KATE: The 7th Duke
DR. DRAKE: I love Ronald Coleman .
KATE: Despite much speculation and a nation wide investigation , a body was neve found . He was never heard from again .
DR. KAU: Until now .
DR. DRAKE: We 've altered the course of history .
DR. KAU: We never should have started this
KATE: Calm down .
DR. PLODDER: What are we going to do ? We ca n't keep him here . Imagine if anyone found out !
KATE: Think . Just , think . Rationally . Now , no one would believe such a stupid mistake could be made because no one would believe any of this is possible . So . We fix this . We keep this to ourselves and we fix it . Fast . They all nod in agreement .
DR. PLODDER: He 's a man , Kate . Not a guinea pig .
KATE: And while he 's here , he 's ours . Any volunteers ? No one moves .
DR. DRAKE: We 'll draw names . Whoever is is picked will be responsible . Agreed ?
DR. KAU: I 'll do it . All the scientists face her .
DR. PLODDER: You 'll look after him ?
DR. KAU: No , I meant I 'll pick the name .
KATE: Fine . Leopold stirs . He blinks at the group .
LEOPOLD: Where ? What has happened ? !
KATE: Your Grace Um Hello Weee aaare a smaaall part of a laaarge esearch team . A project funded by the government of the United States .
LEOPOLD: Oh . Americans . I see
KATE: Yes , um For the past six and a half years we 've been conducting scientific experiments on density and flexibility in the dimensions of time and space .
DR. DRAKE: Yes , uh Quite by accident we came upon a formula utilizing Tachyons particles traveling faster than the speed of light , which allowed us to fold time so to speak .
DR. PLODDER: Yes . Bend it between the cracks of the dimensions .
DR. KAU: Yes . They all laugh nervously . Leopold does not .
DR. DRAKE: Now , while that was n't the original purpose of our experiment , we opted to pursue it , well , privately , on our own .
DR. KAU: Borrowing funds already provided .
KATE: We journeyed to your time because it was the quickest path to follow . We debated long and hard whether we should use this knowledge at all . Believe me , it was never our intent to disturb the past
DR. DRAKE: Merely to discover if the expedition were possible . As your presence here confirms we are very disturbed . Leopold nods at them as if they are insane .
DR. PLODDER: The problem facing us is not only HOW to get you back , but WHEN , you see ?
KATE: We certainly do n't want to miscalculate . Send you to a different era entirely . Leopold starts to speak .
DR. PLODDER: Rest assured , no harm will come to you . You 'll be well looked after by Dr. Coles .
LEOPOLD: Dr. Coles ? I do not follow . What do you mean , get me back home ? Where am I ?
DR. PLODDER: It is the year nineteen hundred and ninety-five .
LEOPOLD: 19 ?
DR. PLODDER: Leopold , calm down !
LEOPOLD: A voyage through time ! What do you take me for ? Did you bring me here y force ?
DR. DRAKE: We 're scientist , not seditionists .
LEOPOLD: Let me out of here ! I wo n't stand for this another moment ! He 's out the door .
KATE: Leopold , wait !
DR. KAU: You do n't know what you 're doing .
DR. PLODDER: Just listen to what we have to say !
LEOPOLD: 19 ?
KATE: Squab .
DR. KAU: Squab ?
KATE: I remember reading they ate a lot of squab .
DR. KAU: Squab Do you have a squab ?
KATE: I do n't know !
DR. KAU: Pull yourself together ! Are you all right back there ?
KATE: You 're going to be fine you know . There 's nothing to worry about . I have everything under control . Dr. Kau stares at Kate in concerned silence .
LEOPOLD: I insist on being returned home immediately .
KATE: I understand . We 're doing our best .
LEOPOLD: I wish to speak with your employer , Dr. Coles .
KATE: You 're speaking to him .
LEOPOLD: You are not suggesting that you are Dr. Coles ? She smiles .
KATE: Dr. Coles . If you like , you could call me Miss Dr. Coles or if that 's too much , how about just plain Kate ?
LEOPOLD: A WOMAN of science ?
KATE: Hard to believe ?
LEOPOLD: But a woman 's brain can not obtain enough knowledge to posses a truly scientific mind .
KATE: Interesting . Nevertheless , we 've come a long way baby .
LEOPOLD: Are you attempting to be humorous ?
KATE: I 'm attempting to be informative it 's just coming out humorous . Leopold regards her dubiously .
LEOPOLD: Young lady , I Surely it is not expected that I remain here with you indefinitely Unchaperoned ?
KATE: Does that make you nervous ?
LEOPOLD: Certainly not !
KATE: Then what are you getting so red about ? It 's a very large apartment with locks on all the doors .
LEOPOLD: The idea ! My dear Miss Coles
KATE: Dr. Coles .
LEOPOLD: Honey
KATE: Let 's get one thing straight right now . My name is Kate or Katherine o if you insist Dr. Coles . Take a good long look , Leopold . I am a 20th century American woman with a Doctorate and a commission and independence . I am not your `` young lady '' or your `` pretty Miss '' or you `` honey . '' Is that clear ?
LEOPOLD: Honey For the tea .
KATE: I 'll get it for you .
LEOPOLD: Thank you Has it been decided what it is I am to do while I am eing held here ?
KATE: Oh , just some laundry , the cooking , a little light housework Leopold does n't react .
LEOPOLD: At what time shall I WEE and POOH ? Kate is forced into a stunned silence .
CHARLIE'S VOICE: Kate ? I 'm home .
KATE: Oh . Yes . Our chaperone is here .
LEOPOLD: Your father ?
KATE: Sort of . My brother .
LEOPOLD: Visiting ?
KATE: For the past two years . Charlie can never know about this project . We 'll tell him you are a overly distinguished colleague staying here as our guest . From Canada . Which would explain your lack of familiarity with our customs and so forth
KATE: Make yourself comfortable . I 'll check in on you later . I think this is going very well , do n't you ? Leopold looks at her blankly .
CHARLIE: What did I do ?
KATE: RINGS ! And what did I say about you smoking in the house ?
CHARLIE: You were against it .
KATE: Correct . You 're back early .
CHARLIE: Hey ! Are you all right ? You look funny .
KATE: Funny ha ha or funny odd ?
CHARLIE: Both .
KATE: That all depends . How was your trip ?
CHARLIE: Why ?
KATE: If it was good I 'll tell you the truth . If it was rotten I 'll have to utter you up first .
CHARLIE: Butter me up .
KATE: Have you been working out ? No , I 'm eally starting to see results . Are you comfortable there on the couch ?
CHARLIE: Very .
KATE: Good . Cause you 'll be sleeping there the next few nights .
CHARLIE: Kate !
KATE: You have to be out of here by 8 and you ca n't be back before 6 . We have an important man working with us with very unusual needs . The company is insisting he stay here .
CHARLIE: What about a hotel ?
KATE: This man requires around the clock attention .
CHARLIE: I meant for me .
KATE: Thank you , Charlie . I owe you one .
CHARLIE: You owe me nine . What am I supposed to do all day ?
KATE: You could get a job !
CHARLIE: Kate , the entire point of being an artist is that I do n't have to work . Who is this guy ?
KATE: Well , I ca n't tell you much because
CHARLIE: Does he have a label ?
KATE: Leopold .
CHARLIE: LEOPOLD ? Is he anything like his name ?
KATE: He 's exactly like his name .
CHARLIE: Then you owe me ten .
LEOPOLD: Horrible ! He quickly scurries out the hallway .
KATE: He 's from Canada
LEOPOLD: What is this ?
KATE: It 's called Hamburger Helper .
LEOPOLD: It is beyond help . Please serve the next course . He pushes his plate away .
KATE: I 'm afraid there is no next course . If you make a list of the foods you like , I 'll pick them up at the store for you .
LEOPOLD: Is all food here this textured ?
CHARLIE: Mine 's good .
LEOPOLD: Please understand , I am used to a different sort of preparation . Where I come from a proper meal is the esult of reflection and study . A ecipe is merely a theme which an intelligent cook can plan each time with variation . Charlie gives Kate a look .
CHARLIE: In Canada ?
LEOPOLD: In Canada .
CHARLIE: We have a saying here . `` Shake and shake the catsup bottle , none will come and then a lot 'll . '' He pours catsup on his dinner .
LEOPOLD: How interesting .
CHARLIE: Since you 're such an expert on fine cuisine , why do n't you make dinne tomorrow night ?
LEOPOLD: It should be obvious to you that I am NOT a domestic . You may take my plate .
CHARLIE: I have my own , thank you .
KATE: Charlie
CHARLIE: Who died and made me Cinderella ?
LEOPOLD: Young man , there is a distinct impertinence to your voice .
CHARLIE: It 's part of my charm .
LEOPOLD: Suppress it .
KATE: Leopold Since you 're our guest here , there are several cultural events you might enjoy seeing . Charlie has season tickets to the ball game . Perhaps you 'd like to take that in ?
LEOPOLD: What is it ?
CHARLIE: What is it ? ?
KATE: Or the Opera or the Ballet ?
CHARLIE: What is it ? ?
KATE: Charlie , there 's no rule that says everyone has to be interested in aseball .
CHARLIE: No , but I believe there is a rule that says everyone has to have HEARD of it .
LEOPOLD: Dr. Coles , your brother Charles attitude and demeanor are unacceptable . If I am to stay on here you must have a serious talk with him regarding respect and civility .
KATE: CHARLES , could you help me with the dessert in the kitchen ?
CHARLIE: In the kitchen ?
KATE: IN the kitchen . Excuse us .
CHARLIE: I do n't believe this guy !
KATE: Try to be nice to him .
CHARLIE: I 'm always NICE !
KATE: Please Charlie , as a favor to me .
CHARLIE: He gives me the creeps . Leopold reacts . He listens self-consciously .
KATE: He 's different that 's all .
CHARLIE: What was that crack about domestics ?
KATE: Charlie , this is important to me .
CHARLIE: You 're not going out with him , are you ?
KATE: Eeuuu ! I may be desperate but I 'm not a lost cause .
CHARLIE: Kate , this is me . I 've seen the guys you bring home .
KATE: I 've done countless favors for you ! Now I 'm asking for just one little thing
CHARLIE: Oh , all right ! All right ! All right ! They emerge from the kitchen , beaming .
KATE: We forgot the dessert .
CHARLIE: You know , I do n't know if I mentioned it but that is one fine looking suit .
KATE: What is it , Leopold ?
LEOPOLD: I can not seem to find the tea
KATE: Leopold , your time is up ! What 's he got , a girl in there ?
LEOPOLD: I should like to read about modern currency during my bath tonight . See that the tub and basin are scrubbed up . Remnants remain of this afternoons shave .
KATE: In our last session you intimated there was a symmetrical system egulating the social order of conformity spanning your era . I found this particularly intriguing If I can just find it in my notes
LEOPOLD: The fire brigade !
KATE: Found it .
LEOPOLD: A resolution ?
KATE: No I meant I found my notes .
LEOPOLD: Dr. Coles ! Changes are in order .
KATE: I can hear you .
LEOPOLD: Miss Coles , as we are to remain here together , there are certain conditions I insist are met and maintained . I no longer wish to be peeped at , mocked
KATE: I never
LEOPOLD: Or interrupted . Jot this down . Breakfast at 12 . Luncheon at 4 . Dine at 8 . A horse should be made available from 1 to 3 .
KATE: A horse ? In New York City ?
LEOPOLD: Yes . Also , I feel very strongly about your style of dress . I do not care for it . I can not believe it is the prevailing taste for women to appear masculine and unkempt . If this is the fashion , have it altered . Kate rises .
KATE: Thank you ! Brushing herself off , she heads to the door .
LEOPOLD: Dr. Coles . I have been acquainted with many women in my time , yet I am compelled to say that the modern woman is by far the least attractive I have ever encountered .
KATE: And I have a news flash of my own . Leopold waits .
DR. DRAKE: Chocolate Peanut Butter Cookie Dough Swirl or Peach ?
DR. KAU: Peach . They dig in .
DR. DRAKE: Any luck ?
DR. KAU: Yea . Lots of luck . All bad . No information exists detailing what happened to Carlson . I 've been working for weeks and I 'm not any close than when I began How are you doing ?
DR. DRAKE: My cholesterol level is up 70 points .
KATE: Fine . Fine Why ? What did you hear ?
DR. DRAKE: Nothing . I was just asking .
KATE: Oh . Well , it 's fine . He 's a delight . Everything 's under control .
DR. KAU: Keep up the good work . She seemed a little scattered . Do you think everything 's all right ?
DR. DRAKE: Katherine Coles is the most capable person we have on this project . If anyone can handle the delicacy of this situation , Kate can .
DR. KAU: So there 's nothing to worry about ?
DR. DRAKE: Absolutely not .
CHARLIE: Are you crazy ? This is the first time all week my eyes are n't darting to the top of my sockets every five minutes .
KATE: When did he leave ?
CHARLIE: I do n't know . An hour ago ? He said he wanted to take a walk .
KATE: And you let him ? ? He 's not allowed to go outside !
CHARLIE: Is he being punished ?
KATE: We 've got to find him ! You stay here in case he finds his way back . And while you wait you 'd better pray he 's all right . If anything happens to him , anything at all , EVERYTHING we 've worked for will have been destroyed . She heads out the door . Charlie follows .
CHARLIE: Kate , calm down .
KATE: And YOU 'LL be responsible . Understand ?
CHARLIE: What 's the big deal ? Who is this guy ? Kate takes a LONG pause .
KATE: Leopold is not really from Canada .
WOMAN MOTORIST: You stupid fucking son of a bitch . Next time I 'll hit ya . Fucking moron .
CABBY: What 're ya waiting for lady ? An invitation ?
KATE: I 'm sorry ! I 'm sorry !
LEOPOLD: $ 7.95 for a sandwich ? Is that correct ?
COUNTER MAN: You got ta problem with that ?
LEOPOLD: It seems rather pricey to me .
COUNTER MAN: So do n't buy one .
LEOPOLD: I sha n't .
COUNTER MAN: So sha n't ! He moves on .
LEOPOLD: Yes , I I would be happy to sample one however I 'm afraid I have n't the finance with me just now . If I could establish a credit with you , I will have someone come round with the funds tomorrow .
COUNTER MAN: You will gladly pay me Tuesday for a hamburger today , is that it ?
LEOPOLD: I believe so . Yes .
COUNTER MAN: Get the fuck outta here .
LEOPOLD: I beg your pardon ?
COUNTER MAN: Get out . Fuckin ' Wimpys piss me off .
LEOPOLD: May I remind you , merchant , that I am the customer in this establishment and as such require your attention and the utmost respect . I do not accept this modern convention of desecrating one 's patrons with such contemptuous disregard .
YUPPIE WOMAN: You tell him .
LEOPOLD: Need I add that without our patronage you would not own that unwashed counter behind which you spew you filthy mouth ?
COUNTER MAN: Where do you get off ? You do n't even have any money .
LEOPOLD: Do n't be irrelevant I 'm browsing .
COUNTER MAN: Not in my store you 're not .
LEOPOLD: Do you intend to physically escort me out ?
KATE: Leopold ! Leopold , get in .
LEOPOLD: I wish to go home .
KATE: Okay . I 'll get you home in a jiffy .
LEOPOLD: No I wish to go home .
CHARLIE: I do n't know . It 's just Leopold . Like Cher . Or Goofy . Kate and Leopold walk in wet and exhausted .
KATE: Charlie , do n't start . I have n't been this angry at you since you got me into that pyramid thing last year . If you make a wisecrack I 'm going to urst into flame .
CHARLIE: It was n't a wisecrack . You do look horrible .
KATE: I 'm too tired for this now . I 'll just save it up and kill you tomorrow . Help Leopold out of his things and lets get him to bed .
LEOPOLD: I 've something to say . To the both of you . I Nothing is what it seems . After witnessing mere weeks of this age it is painfully apparent I am outside of my acquaintance I do n't know how to proceed . I frankly am in need of assistance . I 'm sorry . I 'm not very good at this . In the event you have missed it , I am apologizing . There is a long pause .
CHARLIE: About time . Welcome back .
KATE: Do n't mind him . His heart would be in the right place if he had a heart . Surliness runs in my family .
LEOPOLD: I understand . It practically races through mine .
KATE: Leopold , you made a joke . I mean one that 's not at my expense . That 's good .
LEOPOLD: We 'd better get to bed That is
KATE: Yes I start work in three and a half hours .
LEOPOLD: Oh , dear .
KATE: It 's fine . I 'm used to it .
LEOPOLD: You must n't get too used to it . You 'll find life passes you by awfully quickly .
KATE: Oh ! They stand at their bedroom doors .
LEOPOLD: Well , goodnight then .
KATE: Leopold ? I do n't have a clea handle on this . Perhaps I was wrong keeping you confined to the apartment all this time . I do n't know when you 'll be able return home Tomorrow I 'll start preparing you for the outside world . And We 'll find your way back . I promise .
LEOPOLD: Oh ! I beg your pardon . I , I , I , was merely I did n't
KATE: Is there something you want , Leopold ?
LEOPOLD: I merely wanted to see that is , inquire , on your availability , fo an outing My assimilation and so forth .
KATE: Yes , we have a lot of work ahead of us . I 'll be out in a minute .
LEOPOLD: Yes , of course . Splendid .
KATE: Certainly I 'm certain .
LEOPOLD: Now really . Is n't this better ?
KATE: Put it back .
LEOPOLD: But
KATE: Back ! Leopold reads the paper totally enthralled .
LEOPOLD: Dr. Coles , why is it you are not married ?
KATE: Women are longer defined by the men they 're married to , Leopold . I have a career . I have n't found a man who fits in with that yet .
LEOPOLD: Yet people still marry ?
KATE: I 've heard of cases .
LEOPOLD: I suspect there is something wrong with you .
KATE: There 's nothing wrong with me !
LEOPOLD: Perhaps it is the way you present yourself .
KATE: I do n't know what you 're talking about .
LEOPOLD: There is some sort of problem when a woman reaches thirty and insists on emaining single .
KATE: You think I 'm THIRTY ? !
LEOPOLD: What ?
KATE: Do I look THIRTY to you ?
LEOPOLD: It was an arbitrary number .
KATE: You chose it specifically opposed to a lower number .
LEOPOLD: I did n't mean it .
KATE: Thirty !
LEOPOLD: I apologize How old are you ?
KATE: I 'm thirty ! But you 're the first person whoever told me I looked it !
LEOPOLD: I 'm sorry .
KATE: And it 's not that I insist on emaining single . Believe me . Everyone dreams of finding somebody to share their life with . To give someone all the love they 've been hoarding since they were a kid . I 'm no different . But one has to be sensible . I have a career and a life that 's filled with She looks around . Leopold is gone .
LEOPOLD: She is the woman to whom I was eferring . You see the problem ?
SALESLADY: Yep .
KATE: What ? What ?
LEOPOLD: You have a lovely face .
KATE: The drug of the 20th century .
LEOPOLD: I 'm coming . He does not move a muscle .
KATE: It 's a guy thing .
LEOPOLD: Astounding .
KATE: Once that is discovered , the search egins for the exact time and date travel will be possible . They move to Dr. Kau 's area .
LEOPOLD: How are you proceeding ? Dr. Kau merely grunts . Leopold looks at Kate .
KATE: Do n't take it personally . Once Dr. Kau starts working , you just have to wait until her batteries run down . We 're all pretty much like that . They head into Kate 's office .
LEOPOLD: The complexity of this equation is astonishing ? Can you really comprehend all that ?
KATE: I 'm a genius .
LEOPOLD: You 're quite exceptional Dr. Coles . That is to say , you all are .
KATE: Thank you . And may I say that sometimes , in DIM light , you 're not so bad yourself .
LEOPOLD: May I accompany you ?
KATE: You may n't .
LEOPOLD: I am not certain I understand therapy .
KATE: No one does . That 's why therapists can charge so much .
LEOPOLD: What exactly transpires during therapy ?
KATE: Leopold . A gentleman does not ask those questions . Come on , we 'll get you home .
LEOPOLD: I am perfectly able to travel homeward myself . Kate looks at him skeptically .
KATE: All right . Do n't bite my head off . She shakes her head and walks out the door .
LEOPOLD: I ca n't seem to
NUN: Oh , for heaven 's sake
MRS. PINCUS: I was worried . I thought you were n't going to make it .
KATE: Miss my lesson ? This is the only thing I have to look forward to all week . Is that a new dress Mrs. Pincus ?
INSTRUCTOR: All right , kids . Pair up !
KATE: I am !
INSTRUCTOR: Dancing should not be work . It should e a vacation the body takes from the mind . Let the music wash ove you .
KATE: It is !
INSTRUCTOR: Repeat after me I 've got the muusic in me .
KATE: I 've got the muusic in me .
INSTRUCTOR: Keep telling yourself that .
DR. KAU: I 've located her .
DR. PLODDER: You did n't ! Is she all right ?
DR. KAU: No . She 's really not .
DR. PLODDER: Christine , this morning I spoke with the head of funding . They 're talking about canceling the project .
DR. KAU: What ? ! They ca n't do that !
DR. PLODDER: There 's still time . Nothing has happened yet that ca n't be undone . We 'll get her back . We 'll put this ehind us and we 'll get her back .
CHARLIE: Is there something on your mind ? There is a pause .
LEOPOLD: This is rather difficult for me .
CHARLIE: Uh huh ?
LEOPOLD: I have been in the salon contemplating the reception I have received by the various tradesmen I have visited . I 've determined I am lacking the dexterity of modern intercourse .
CHARLIE: Of what ? ?
LEOPOLD: Social skills .
CHARLIE: Oh .
LEOPOLD: I realize our association has been ather distant and I bear you no ill will .
CHARLIE: You can imagine my relief .
LEOPOLD: The fact is I need help .
CHARLIE: Why not ask Kate ?
LEOPOLD: I would appreciate the masculine point of view .
CHARLIE: Why not ask Kate ? That was a joke .
LEOPOLD: My walk ?
CHARLIE: You do n't walk right . You strut .
CHARLIE: Strut strut strut . You walk into the athroom it 's like I 'm watching a parade . Walk across the room .
LEOPOLD: I will not .
CHARLIE: I know you wo n't . You 'll STRUT . You asked for my help . Trust me on this .
LEOPOLD: That 's enough ! Really ! You walk .
CHARLIE: See ? Easy . Relaxed . You try .
LEOPOLD: What ?
CHARLIE: Leopold , are you wearing a corset ?
LEOPOLD: Naturally .
CHARLIE: What 'd ya say was the name of this number ?
LEOPOLD: Tchaikovsky . Waltz of the Flowers .
CHARLIE: Pretty .
LEOPOLD: What in the world ?
MAN: Sorry ! We 're so sorry . Are you hurt ?
WOMAN: She 's another Babe Ruth . We had no idea . Are you okay ? Leopold regards them curiously .
ELIZABETH: I 'm sorry !
LEOPOLD: Is this your child ?
MAN: Yes .
LEOPOLD: I see .
WOMAN: C'mon honey , lets go .
ELIZABETH: I want my ball .
LEOPOLD: Just a moment ! Pick a hand .
MAN: What do you say , Elizabeth ? Elizabeth makes an embarrassed face .
LEOPOLD: I understand pumpkin pies , pizza pies , and pot pies . But I wish someone would explain Eskimo pies .
KATE: It 's margarine .
LEOPOLD: It 's marvelous .
CHARLIE: Well , I 'm off .
KATE: Me too . Work to do . Where are you going ?
CHARLIE: I 'm meeting everyone over at Caffeine . It 's this coffee house we go to .
KATE: Say hello to Dennis for me .
LEOPOLD: Who is that ?
CHARLIE: Dennis is this really good looking friend of mine who does n't know Kate 's alive because SHE does n't know how to flirt .
KATE: As a rule I do n't like to associate with really good looking people . It makes me feel really I do n't know Smart . But Dennis is a nice guy .
CHARLIE: And he always picks up the check .
LEOPOLD: Sounds enjoyable . I shall join you .
CHARLIE: What ?
KATE: That 's a wonderful idea ! Leopold mentioned how he wanted to meet People of quality was it ?
CHARLIE: Ahhhhh ?
LEOPOLD: If you 'd rather I did n't go
KATE: Nonsense ! Charlie , you do n't want to hurt Leopold 's feelings . He 's going to think you do n't want him to go .
CHARLIE: Oh it 's not that . It 's just that it 's sort of a vulgar crowd , is all . I 'm not sure you 'd have such a good time .
LEOPOLD: A little ribald humor ? I 'm not as ig a stick in the mud as you might think ! I 'd enjoy a gay night out , kicking up my heels .
CHARLIE: Finish off your Parquet and we 'll go . Charlie gives Kate a look of death as we
LEOPOLD: Proper speech does not cease to exist simply because it is ignored .
CHARLIE: Please ?
LEOPOLD: Charles , you need n't fret . I have the walk down pat . I will not give myself away . Like .
CHARLIE: Oh shit ! Shoot .
LEOPOLD: What is it ?
CHARLIE: Patrice . See that girl ? The blonde one ? She 's so inconceivably hot .
LEOPOLD: She 's very pretty .
CHARLIE: She 's mine .
LEOPOLD: Congratulations .
CHARLIE: Ok not exactly mine . But I saw he first .
LEOPOLD: I understand .
CHARLIE: Okay . I guess we should go in . I do n't suppose we could tell everyone you do n't speak English ?
LEOPOLD: Of course not . Let 's go inside .
ALL: Charlie ! Where 've you been ? etc .
CHARLIE: Hi . Uh everyone , this is my friend , Leo .
BILL: Hey .
LEOPOLD: Hey .
DENNIS: Waz up ?
LEOPOLD: Waz up ?
PATRICE: How are ya ?
LEOPOLD: How are ya ?
CHARLIE: Leo 's staying with us for a while .
LEOPOLD: May I ?
PATRICE: Help yourself .
LEOPOLD: Thank you , my dear .
CHARLIE: Um ? I have nothing to say .
LEOPOLD: You did not tell the truth about Patrice , Charles .
CHARLIE: What did I tell you , LEO ?
LEOPOLD: He informed me you were inconceivably HOT , but I think you 're lovely . Exceptionally lovely .
PATRICE: Thank you , Leo .
CHARLIE: Check please .
LEOPOLD: But Charles , it is so ridiculous . I am not interested in her .
CHARLIE: Hah !
LEOPOLD: In any case the problem is not with me but with you . You have no idea what it takes to go about courting a woman . From what I 've witnessed tonight , it is symptomatic of your entire generation .
CHARLIE: You are some piece of work , Leopold .
LEOPOLD: Now I do not wish to get personal
CHARLIE: I 'm fascinated . Go on .
LEOPOLD: Now , why was I successful with this young lady and why did you so miserably fail ?
CHARLIE: What makes you think she likes you ?
LEOPOLD: Well she gave me the number of he telephone and I assumed it meant
CHARLIE: Go on .
LEOPOLD: As I see it , the girl has n't an inkling of your intentions . And it 's no wonder . You , Charles , are a Merry Andrew .
CHARLIE: A what ?
LEOPOLD: A Merry Andrew .
CHARLIE: I am not ! !
LEOPOLD: Everything plays like a farce to you . The more wit , the less courage . I believe the modern woman desires passion , protection , sensitivity . No woman wants to be romanced by a uffoon . Banter and repartee are fine but you must add to that a different sort of playfulness .
CHARLIE: You think I should pounce ?
LEOPOLD: I 'm saying you must treat her with espect . Any oaf can attempt a crude pass . A woman of Kate 's stature would never respond to an artificial tactic .
CHARLIE: Kate ?
LEOPOLD: What ?
CHARLIE: You said Kate .
LEOPOLD: I did not .
CHARLIE: Yes you did . Did n't he say Kate ? The old woman nods .
LEOPOLD: We are discussing your problem .
CHARLIE: Not anymore . You like my sister .
LEOPOLD: Charles
CHARLIE: She has trouble with men , you know .
LEOPOLD: Perhaps she has not met the right one .
CHARLIE: She has met the right one . HUNDREDS of times . But she pulls back . She cuts herself off . You turn around and suddenly you 're dating a Sphinx .
LEOPOLD: One never can tell .
CHARLIE: Does Kate know how you feel ?
LEOPOLD: No
CHARLIE: Have you made your intentions known to her ?
LEOPOLD: No
CHARLIE: Who 's the Merry Andrew now ? ! I think you 're all talk and no action . What are you waiting for ?
LEOPOLD: I do not know if there is a future in it .
CHARLIE: Well Leopold , no one ever does
KATE: Royal family Uncouth . Making Out slow soulful kissing Woman as equals ? ? She flips a page .
LEOPOLD: What 's that ?
KATE: Bread and butter . It 's an old saying Well not to you I guess . You say it when you pass someone in a cramped space . As close as bread and butter .
LEOPOLD: I see .
KATE: So . Did you have a good time last night ?
LEOPOLD: It was very interesting .
KATE: Did you find that person of quality ? Leopold looks at her a moment .
LEOPOLD: Yes . I did .
KATE: Well fine . I guess it 's time to turn in .
LEOPOLD: Yes .
KATE: Goodnight . She reaches her door . Leopold stops her .
LEOPOLD: Kate ?
CHARLIE: Hi . I brought you some flowers . He hands her the flower filled painting .
PATRICE: Charlie !
CHARLIE: Miss Wochuchowski ? I was wondering if you would do me the great hono of accompanying me to the cinema tonight . And allowing me the privilege of escorting you to dinner afterwards . Patrice shyly studies the painting .
PATRICE: It 's beautiful .
CHARLIE: Gracing me with your conversation and company would mean the world to me .
PATRICE: Um 7 00 ?
CHARLIE: 7 00 is fine . I 'll call for you then . They smile at each other for a long moment .
LEOPOLD: Goodbye .
CHARLIE: Goodbye . It worked !
LEOPOLD: Of course it did .
CHARLIE: Leopold , I I 'm I have no idea what to do next !
LEOPOLD: Charles . Leave everything to me .
CHARLIE: Not so fast , buddy . You 're next .
LEOPOLD: Good morning .
KATE: Good morning . You 're up early .
LEOPOLD: I 'm terribly sorry ! !
KATE: Happens all the time
LEOPOLD: Dr. Coles ? ah , Kate ? I was wondering She stops working and looks at Leopold .
KATE: Oh . It 's my computer . She resumes her work .
LEOPOLD: I see . Actually I meant the work itself .
KATE: I 'm researching the correlations etween your time and the present . Leopold stares blankly .
LEOPOLD: Oh .
KATE: It 's made me the man I am today .
LEOPOLD: It 's quite a beautiful day , have you noticed ? Perhaps you would permit yourself some time off and grant me the privilege of escorting you around the city this fine Spring afternoon .
KATE: Oh , I 'd love to but I ca n't . I 've got too much work to do . Ask Charlie though . He 'll go with you .
LEOPOLD: I 'm afraid it really would n't be the same . It is YOUR company I am seeking .
KATE: Oh , Leopold . I 'm so sorry . I ca n't .
LEOPOLD: I see . Some other time then .
KATE: Yes Thank you .
LEOPOLD: Maybe if you
KATE: NO , no , it does this all the time . Just have to wait it out .
LEOPOLD: I see .
KATE: Darn .
LEOPOLD: Perhaps it is a sign ?
KATE: Oh , you think ?
LEOPOLD: Allow me .
KATE: That 's simplicity in it 's purest form . It speaks volumes in it 's nothingness . Whiteness representing emptiness . Hopelessness . It 's bleak . Bleak !
LEOPOLD: Aaand this represents ? They burst into giddy laughter .
KATE: Absolutely nothing .
LEOPOLD: I 'd almost forgotten how beautiful it was . Truly . Beautiful .
KATE: VIP , VHS , VCR .
LEOPOLD: Ah , JFK , PDQ , XYZ .
KATE: I do n't know . K.D . Lang .
LEOPOLD: I do n't know how you keep up with it . I 'm exhausted .
KATE: So am I .
LEOPOLD: I 'll tell you what . Why do n't I prepare dinner tomorrow night ? I never have before . I mean even before I hit town . `` Hit town '' How 's that ? I ca n't imagine what it 'll taste like , ut I do n't think it will be any worse than your cooking .
KATE: Leopold , I have a date tomorrow night .
LEOPOLD: I see .
KATE: A blind date .
LEOPOLD: Oh , I 'm so sorry .
KATE: No , that just means I have n't met him before . It was set up through friends .
LEOPOLD: Ah !
KATE: A hazard of single life I 'm turning in . Kate gets up . Leopold automatically stands .
LEOPOLD: Another time then .
KATE: I 'm sorry .
LEOPOLD: It 's quite all right . As she gets to the door , she stops .
KATE: Leopold ? I had a wonderful time today . I ca n't remember the last time I took the day off and just played . I 'd forgotten how beautiful this city can be I want to thank you for that .
LEOPOLD: The pleasure was mine . Kate smiles at Leopold and goes out .
CHARLIE: It 's a very fancy restaurant , Leopold . Are you sure you can teach me everything there is to know ?
KATE: Just do n't swipe the silverware and give yourself away .
CHARLIE: Nobody 's talking to you .
LEOPOLD: It is very simple . I will be you date . Just behave as you normally would and I 'll correct you along the way . Now , escort me in .
CHARLIE: Now what ?
LEOPOLD: Pull the chair for a lady ! Clod .
CHARLIE: Now do n't burst a vein or anything , ut there are quite a few knives and forks here . How do I know what each one 's for ?
LEOPOLD: Merely start from the outside and work your way in .
CHARLIE: What kind of beer should I order ?
LEOPOLD: Beer !
CHARLIE: I WAS KIDDING !
KATE: How do I look ?
LEOPOLD: You look exquisite , Katherine .
KATE: Thank you , Leopold .
CHARLIE: This is a tie I 'm wearing .
KATE: You look very nice , Charlie .
CHARLIE: Yes . I know . The doorbell rings .
KATE: That must be him .
LEOPOLD: Your bland date ?
KATE: Blind date .
CHARLIE: Remember to breathe , Kate . And do n't use to many big words . You 'll scare the poor slob away .
KATE: This is always the scary part . `` Open the door to my , Mystery Date . ''
LARRY: Hi . Kate ?
KATE: Larry ?
LEOPOLD: Kate , may I have a word with you ?
KATE: Now ?
LEOPOLD: Yes . I DO N'T like the look of him .
KATE: What are you talking about ?
LEOPOLD: Cad . I can spot one a mile away . I shall escort you out myself . I will act as your chaperone .
KATE: That is n't necessary . I 'll be fine .
LEOPOLD: It is no trouble .
KATE: Goodnight , Leopold .
LEOPOLD: But
KATE: Goodnight .
LARRY: Sit down .
KATE: Thank you .
LARRY: So . How am I doing ?
KATE: I beg your pardon ?
LARRY: How am I doing ? First date . You pleased ? You disappointed ?
KATE: Undecided .
LARRY: I see .
KATE: About you ? Ah , she said you were tall .
LARRY: 6 ' 3 .
KATE: And nice looking .
LARRY: Thank you .
KATE: Thank her . And that you persevere ardently on Wall Street .
LARRY: Well , I work there
KATE: That must be very interesting .
LARRY: You 've obviously never worked on Wall Street .
KATE: No . Their laughter subsides . After a beat
LARRY: What else did Jeannie say about me ?
PATRICE: Have I told you how much I liked your painting ?
CHARLIE: Twice .
PATRICE: If you get tired of hearing about it , let me know . I have to admit I was sort of surprised when you called . I did n't think you liked me , Charlie .
CHARLIE: When I first saw you , I thought
PATRICE: What do you think now ?
KATE: Aaand that 's about all Jeannie said . What did Jeannie say about me ?
LARRY: She said you were enormously sexy , had a great body , but you do n't put out .
KATE: Quite a compelling portrait .
LARRY: Would you say it 's an accurate portrait ?
KATE: A masterpiece .
LARRY: So this guy wants to invest $ 50,000 in a stock that 's no good . Here 's what I do
KATE: Who ?
LARRY: Jeff Murray . The guy I 've been talking about . Hello ?
KATE: Goodbye . Then as she leaves , a parting shot .
LEOPOLD: Bread and butter .
KATE: No .
LEOPOLD: Is it gone ?
KATE: No .
LEOPOLD: How inconsiderate .
KATE: Yeah , it was . The harder I tried , the more persistent he became . He 's conceited and inflated and unseasoned and it does n't seem to matter He 's 134 years old but I ca n't get him out of my head .
LEOPOLD: Is he there right now ?
KATE: Right here . Larger than life .
LEOPOLD: I 'll protect you They kiss . A long romantic passionate kiss .
KATE: Permission granted .
LEOPOLD: Until tomorrow , then .
KATE: YOU do . What have you got there ? Leopold opens the casserole dish .
LEOPOLD: I know you like it .
KATE: Um , where was I ? So after my fathe died I had to go to work .
LEOPOLD: Have you had many jobs ?
KATE: Many . I got fired from all of them . I 'm the most unskilled person I know . But they were just survival jobs while I was still in school . I always knew I wanted to go into science like my father . And I did .
LEOPOLD: Do you miss him ?
KATE: I think about him every day . He was courtly , just like you .
LEOPOLD: I think you are a remarkable woman Katherine Coles .
KATE: You just do n't get out much . You 'd e surprised how remarkable I 'm not .
LEOPOLD: No , it is you who would be surprised .
CHARLIE: Good morning .
PATRICE: Morning . They kiss .
KATE: Morning .
LEOPOLD: Good morning . They kiss shyly . Kate notices the feast .
KATE: Look what you 've done !
LEOPOLD: It 's nothing .
KATE: Nothing ? My own mother never made me a breakfast like this .
LEOPOLD: I will have to have a talk with her .
KATE: Leopold
LEOPOLD: Kate
KATE: About last night
LEOPOLD: Please sit down .
KATE: I sense the word `` BUT '' entering into this any minute now .
LEOPOLD: Do me the honor Katherine , of becoming my wife .
KATE: Leopold ! Did you just ask me to marry you ?
LEOPOLD: I love you , Kate .
KATE: That 's entirely beside the point You 're moving way too fast here . Should n't we date first ? I mean it 's obvious the first one went well
LEOPOLD: Where I come from that 's pretty much the way it works .
KATE: Leopold , even though last night we loved each other , that does n't mean this morning we 're engaged . It just does n't work that way now .
LEOPOLD: I have loved you since I first set eyes on you . I can not imagine my life without you beside me . I want to marry you , Kate and make an honest woman of you .
KATE: Oh Leopold , sit down .
LEOPOLD: Do you not love me Kate ?
KATE: Do n't ever think that
LEOPOLD: Then consider my proposal .
KATE: I 'll think it over but I can tell you now the answer is He kisses her . It 's impressive .
LEOPOLD: I need you beside me . I will not give up easily .
KATE: Do what you have to do
CHARLIE: Morning .
LEOPOLD: Coffee ?
CHARLIE: I would like some coffee .
KATE: Of course . Say when .
CHARLIE: When .
KATE: Sorry .
CHARLIE: Uh huh .
DR. KAY: Kate , are you all right ?
KATE: Fine ! I 'm fine .
LEOPOLD: Public office is apparently still the last refuge for the incompetent . Show me a man who does not want his gun registered and I 'll show you a man who should not own a gun . What is a pee-pee girl ?
KATE: What are you reading ?
LEOPOLD: The Village Voice . After much consideration , I have decided it is time I join the work force .
KATE: As a pee-pee girl ?
LEOPOLD: Perhaps not that , but I am determined to acquire honest employment .
KATE: Leopold , I do n't know if that 's such a good idea .
LEOPOLD: Kate , my life back home was beneficial to no one . I want my new life to have value . I wo n't make the same mistakes twice .
KATE: You have to be patient .
LEOPOLD: I could conceivably wait my whole life away .
KATE: You 're awfully cute when you get causey .
LEOPOLD: I will not waste any more time . I must make a difference .
RICH CUSTOMER: What is it ?
LEOPOLD: It is called , POISON . He squirts some at her .
RICH CUSTOMER: Oh ! I do n't think so . Have you got
LEOPOLD: I beg your pardon ?
RICH CUSTOMER: Elizabeth Taylor 's Passion ?
LEOPOLD: Next aisle over . She leaves . Leopold looks after her .
KATE: Hi . What 's the matter ?
DR. KAU: We had to go through your compute to access information . You calculations have been verified and the final course has been set . Leopold goes back a week from Friday 1 17 a.m .
DR. PLODDER: How long were you going to keep it a secret , Kate ?
DR. DRAKE: Were you even going to tell us at all ?
KATE: I 'm not sure .
DR. PLODDER: Not sure ? What can you be thinking ? You ca n't alter the course of history and assume everything will be okay . It wo n't be . He has his own destiny to fulfill in his own time .
KATE: You do n't understand .
DR. DRAKE: He 's going back , Kate .
DR. PLODDER: It 's over .
KATE: No No , no , no .
CHARLIE: There you are . I 've only been hollering for the last
KATE: It 's time . Leopold 's going back .
CHARLIE: Kate
KATE: Yup . I 'll get his things together . Tell him tonight . He goes to her .
CHARLIE: Are you all right ?
KATE: I 'm fine .
CHARLIE: You do n't look so fine .
KATE: Well I am . It was wonderful having him here , Charlie . He was of invaluable assistance to the project . I 'll miss him .
CHARLIE: You 'll miss him ?
KATE: I will .
CHARLIE: Goddamnit Kate , you love the guy ! Kate remains silent .
KATE: What am I supposed to DO , Charlie ? ? I ca n't go back . He ca n't stay . I ca n't let him go . I 'm not equipped to deal with this , Charlie . I do n't know how .
CHARLIE: Listen to me , Kate . Do n't ! Do n't be the ice princess .
KATE: I 'm not !
CHARLIE: You are . You ca n't live your whole life under a microscope . You 've got to tell him how you feel .
KATE: It 's too much , Charlie . It 's just too much .
CHARLIE: You owe it to him .
KATE: I did n't know I could feel like this . I really did n't know .
LEOPOLD: So I looked him right in the eye and said , 'Ego is nature 's compensation for mediocrity . ' I turned and I walked . He never said a word He probably did n't understand it Kate ?
KATE: What ?
LEOPOLD: Are you all right ? You 're awfully quiet .
KATE: I 'm fine .
LEOPOLD: How was your day ?
KATE: It 's time . Leopold looks at her .
LEOPOLD: When ?
KATE: A week from Friday , early morning .
LEOPOLD: No !
KATE: It was a mistake , Leopold . It 's out of our hands . We ca n't POCKET people from history like stolen jewels . We have n't the right I 'm sorry . We 'll miss you .
LEOPOLD: Is that all ?
KATE: What do you want me to do , fall apart ? You 'd still be leaving . It would n't solve anything .
LEOPOLD: Who is this woman sitting across from me ?
KATE: What do you want me to say , Leopold ?
LEOPOLD: Tell me that you love me as I love you . Let me hear you say it .
KATE: Leopold !
LEOPOLD: Good God . Look at you . You look awful .
KATE: You should see what I 'm looking at .
LEOPOLD: I went back to the restaurant . They told me you went out looking for me ight after I left .
KATE: That was pound cakes ago . Where were you ?
LEOPOLD: I had a lot to think over .
KATE: Such as ?
LEOPOLD: Just where I stand around here . There is a long pause .
KATE: We should have come up with something together . I might have been spared ten or seventy pounds .
LEOPOLD: Is that an apology ?
KATE: I 'm sorry for what I said .
LEOPOLD: I 'm not going anywhere .
KATE: Yes you are
LEOPOLD: I 'm not going . I 'm staying here with you .
KATE: But ? You ca n't ! We have no right to
LEOPOLD: It is my destiny . It is my decision .
KATE: Have you thought about what you 'd be sacrificing ? Your influence ? You authority ? They kiss .
LEOPOLD: I love you , Kate . The single most miraculous event in my life was not how I arrived here , but that when I did , I found you .
KATE: Here comes the mushy part !
LEOPOLD: After much consideration I 've come to the conclusion I no longer desire a large estate with a full staff and ornate grounds .
KATE: That 's good , because if you 're staying I 'll probably get fired again . What do you desire ?
LEOPOLD: A beautiful wife , a small home in the middle of nowhere , lots of children , and fine schools with PMS meetings every other Sunday .
KATE: PTA ?
LEOPOLD: PTA .
KATE: I love you too . I do , Leopold . I love you , too . They kiss .
DR. PLODDER: This is outrageous ! I wo n't allow it !
LEOPOLD: The decision is not yours to make .
DR. PLODDER: Do you realize what you 're saying ? You 're tampering with fate , preordinance , and God himself .
LEOPOLD: We do that every day , doctor . It is called CHOICE .
DR. KAU: Dr. Carlson is still over there . You ca n't simply abandon her . We have to get her back .
KATE: Do you think I 'm not aware of that ? Do you think a minute goes by that I do n't feel responsible for her ? But
DR. KAU: Only one person can return . The capsule accommodates only one person . Leopold has to find her .
LEOPOLD: Perhaps she does not wish to return . Perhaps she 's found greater happiness in her new life . It happened to me .
KATE: Maybe this is her destiny . Maybe she 's of more important use back there .
DR. KAU: Julia Carlson died in the Cente Factory fire of 1897 , two years afte she arrived . She was 37 years old . There is a stunned silence .
DR. DRAKE: Dear lord .
DR. KAU: She was a friend , Kate . She was neve expected to sacrifice her life fo this experiment . I wo n't be a party to it . I know what I 'm asking There 's no way we can force you to go . Just think it over .
KATE: You 're going back are n't you ?
LEOPOLD: I keep seeing that poor woman 's face . She was terrified .
KATE: You said you would n't leave me I 've never been lucky . Not one time .
LEOPOLD: Six months ago I would n't have given it another thought . I would n't have lost a moment 's sleep . You 've changed me , Kate . There is no turning back .
KATE: I would n't WANT you to change . That 's what 's tearing me up inside . Eithe way I lose You 've changed me too . I ca n't go back to my old life anymore . I ca n't live like that again . God my heart is pounding like a drum . I 've never been so scared in my life . Take me with you , Leopold . God . Take me with you .
LEOPOLD: You do n't realize what you 're saying ! You do n't understand the kind of life you 'd lead . What you 'd be giving up .
KATE: I 'd be with you .
LEOPOLD: I ca n't ask that of you .
KATE: Just ask me Just ask .
LEOPOLD: Come back with me . She slowly turns . She embraces him .
KATE: Yes !
LEOPOLD: This is something I 've wanted to do for a long time .
KATE: Leopold ?
LEOPOLD: This will be very therapeutic . He takes her arm and escorts her in .
DR. DRAKE: The time tables have been set . Just strap yourself in and you 'll be fine .
DR. PLODDER: You have only a twenty four hou leeway before the machine is set to eturn to us . You must find Carlson within that time frame and get he on board or there will be little chance of her finding a way back .
LEOPOLD: I understand .
DR. DRAKE: It 's been a real pleasure . You have a much nicer smile than Ronald Coleman .
LEOPOLD: The privilege was mine .
DR. KAU: Goodbye Leopold , and thank you .
LEOPOLD: Oh , my .
DR. KAU: Do n't worry . We 'll send Kate to you as soon as possible . I 'll see to it myself .
LEOPOLD: See that you do .
DR. KAU: You have my word on it . The doctors leave .
DR. DRAKE: Four minutes and counting .
CHARLIE: Well ? I 'll make this quick . Goodbye . He sticks out his hand .
LEOPOLD: Goodbye . I shall miss you Charles , more than you know .
CHARLIE: I 'll miss you too , Leopold You 're the only one who knows how to program the VCR Take care of my sister .
LEOPOLD: I will .
CARLSON: You better . Take care of yourself too while you 're at it So long .

KATE: I know . I brought you something .
LEOPOLD: Kate
KATE: So you would n't think this was all a dream . They kiss .
LEOPOLD: I love you , Kate .
KATE: Wait for me .
LEOPOLD: For as long as it takes .
KATE: I will come back to you ! I will !
LEOPOLD: I 'll be waiting . They kiss again for the last time .
DR. DRAKE: It 's time Leopold .
DR. PLODDER: 9 8 7 6 5 4
DR. DRAKE: I ca n't be a part of it either Kate . I 'm sorry .
DR. KAU: It 's too big a risk .
DR. PLODDER: We can not guarantee your child 's safety . It 's that simple .
KATE: He 's waiting for me . I can feel it . Oh , Leopold

LEO: Good night .
KATE: He 's so YOUNG , Charlie .
CHARLIE: He 's old enough .
KATE: Look at that idiotic expression on his face .
CHARLIE: He 's happy .

JULES: Just a quick one . Please !
LASER: Hug her . That 's what she 's there for .
NIC: Ugh . Maybe we should just sit him down and ask him already .
JULES: What ? `` Are you and Clay fucking ? ''
NIC: `` Exploring '' is the word I 'd use
JULES: And what if he is `` exploring ? '' This is the age for that . Why should we care ?
NIC: We should n't I just do n't understand why he 's exploring with that loser .
JULES: Look , we do n't even know what the deal is . We 're jumping to conclusions .
NIC: I feel like he has so much potential and he 's just wasting it . Nic 's comment hits a nerve in Jules .
JULES: What are you trying to say ?
NIC: What do you mean , what am I trying to say ?
JULES: It feels like there 's some subtext here .
NIC: What are you talking about ?
JULES: I do n't know Like mother like son ? Is that it ? Both of us aimless , wandering in the darkness , `` wasting our potential ? '' Nic wo n't go there .
NIC: Okay , honey , you 're on a whole other tangent and I have no idea what you 're talking about .
JULES: Well , maybe it has n't risen to the plane of consciousness for you yet .
NIC: Yeah . Maybe not .

JULES: Honey , that 's not what he asked
NIC: Fine . Do you want to answer his question ? !
JULES: Well , sweetie , human sexuality is complicated . And sometimes , people 's desires can becounter- intuitive For instance , since women 's sexual esponsiveness is mostly internal , sometimes it 's exciting for us to see sexual responsiveness more , you know externalized . Laser looks at them , still baffled .
LASER: But like , would n't you rather watch two women doing it ?
JULES: You would think that . But in most of those movies , they 've hired two straight women to pretend and the inauthenticity is just unbeara
NIC: Okay , that 's enough ! Laser , you mom and I have a sense there 's some other stuff going on in your life and we just want to be let in .
LASER: What do you mean ?
JULES: Are you having a relationship with someone ?
NIC: You could tell us , honey . We 'd understand and support you .
LASER: I just met him once . Nic and Jules share a worried look .
NIC: What do you mean once ?
JULES: Did he find you on-line ? !
LASER: What ? !
NIC: Who did you meet once ?

JONI: Because we knew you 'd be upset .
NIC: WE 'RE NOT UPSET ! !
JULES: Honey We just wish you 'd have included us in your thinking . But what 's done is done . You met him , and now you guys can move on
JONI: Actually I want to see him again .
NIC: Whoa ! Whoa ! No . No way . Nobody is seeing anyone until we meet him !
JULES: Of course I know . I do n't want to time-share our kids with someone . Especially when it 's Joni 's last summer home . No way .
NIC: Jesus , Jules ! The plumber was just here ! Nic throws the clump of hair in the trash .
JULES: I know
NIC: Let 's just kill him with kindness and put it to bed .

NIC: Are you kidding ? We love it . And a Petit Syrah . What a treat ! Let me get some glasses .
PAUL: Beautiful house . How long you guys lived here ?
JULES: Almost ten years . Wait , has it een that long ? We moved right after Laser broke his leg , I remember that because we had a ramp for a while , so that would have beenten , no , nine ? No , ten years this fall . Paul nods , smiling at her nervousness .

PAUL: The food 's great . Ca n't go wrong with salmon and corn .
NIC: So Paul , did you always know you wanted to be in food-services industry ? Paul smiles at Nic , trying to disarm her .
PAUL: Well , I always liked food .
NIC: No , I was asking because I remembe eading in your file , back when we were looking for , you know , sperm , anyway , you said you were studying international relations .
PAUL: Oh yeah . Wow , that was a long time ago . Yeah , I was considering it , ut then I dropped out of school .
JONI: You dropped out of college ?
PAUL: Yeah , it was n't my thing .
NIC: No ? Why 's that ?
PAUL: It just seemed like a massive waste of money after a while . I mean , I was n't `` doing '' anything . I was just sitting on my ass listening to people spout off ideas I could 've just as easily learned reading a ook .
LASER: See what he did there , mom ? You said `` food-services industry , '' then he said `` food-services industry ''
NIC: Yeah , I got it , Laser . Thanks . So , Paul , what about your social life ?
PAUL: My social life ?
NIC: You know , are you married , divorced , seeing anyone ?
JONI: Mom !
NIC: What ? We 're getting to know Paul .
PAUL: No , never been married or divorced . I date a little , but I 'm just kind of focused on my work right now .
NIC: Oh . Paul wants a break from the heat .
PAUL: So , how 'd you guys meet ? Jules smiles , embarrassed . Nic jumps in .
NIC: We met at UCLA . I was a resident in the ER and Jules had an emergency .
JULES: My tongue went numb .
PAUL: Really ?
JULES: Laser , that 's not nice .
LASER: What 's not nice is subjecting you kids to the same story 1000 times !
PAUL: What happened to your tongue ?
JULES: I do n't know . I just lost all the feeling in my face and tongue and I thought I might gag and then , you know
PAUL: Choke ? Die ?
JULES: Yeahexactly
NIC: Well it was pretty clear to me she was just having an anxiety attack and she 'd be fine .
PAUL: So what 'd you do for her ?
NIC: Gave her a Vallium . Tried to get her to relax , talk , move her tongue around .
LASER: Mom , that 's gross !
JULES: Actually , she started teasing me and that really helped .
NIC: I was trying to distract you .
JULES: I know . And it worked . You were eally funny .
NIC: You were really pretty .
JULES: So that 's it . My tongue started working again .
NIC: And we 've been glued at the hip ever since .
PAUL: That 's a great story .
JULES: We like it . Laser and Joni share a look .
PAUL: So Nic , I know you 're a doctor . How ` bout you , Jules ? What do you do ? Jules never likes this question .
JULES: Well , I , you know , I studied architecture in college
PAUL: Right
JULES: But I 'm not an architect . I mean I was on my way to becoming one . But I quit before the kids were born .
PAUL: Well , that happens
JULES: When they got a little older , I started a Balinese furniture import usiness
PAUL: Right on .
JULES: Yeah . But that did n't work out .
PAUL: Well , business are n't easy
JULES: Actually , I 'm in the process of starting a new business .
PAUL: Good for you . What kind ?
JULES: Landscape design But not like a gardener ! I mean , yes , there 's a gardening component to it , but the real work is to create unique , eco-friendly outdoo spaces that harmonize with the surrounding environment . Do you know what I mean ?
PAUL: Absolutely .
NIC: Hey Paul , did Joni tell you about her graduation speech ?
PAUL: No , she did n't .
NIC: It was incredible . So full of wisdom and hope Hon , go get it . I 'm sure he 'd love to hear it
JONI: No , mom , I 'm sure he would n't
NIC: Sure he would . Come on . Go get it
JONI: No , it 's okay
NIC: Sweetie , do n't be embarrassed .
JONI: I 'm not embarrassed ! Jesus ! Give it a rest already !
LASER: I 'll get the ice-cream .
JONI: I 'll help you .
JULES: Honey , that 's your forth glass .
NIC: Actually , it 's my third . But thanks for counting .
PAUL: Hey , I was just thinking . You know , I bought this place last yea and the backyard 's a wreck . Would you be interested in working on it ?
JULES: Oh , that 's okay .
PAUL: No , seriously . I do n't have time to work on it myself .
JULES: Thank you . That 's really sweet . Why do n't you think about it .
PAUL: Why ? I just did . I mean , if you 're not up for it that 's okay
JULES: No ! I am ! I 'm up for it !
NIC: I 'm just saying , the plan was to limit his involvement
JULES: You 're unbelievable . You 're all over me about getting clients , I finally get one and you 're
NIC: He 's not just a client , Jules .
JULES: Yes , and I think it 's disgusting .
NIC: I 'm sorry . He just seemed sort ofself-satisfied to me .
JULES: Yeah , he was working the whole `` alternative '' thing pretty hard .
NIC: `` I just need to get outside and ` do ' things , not sit on my ass and learn . But that 's just me . I 'm weird that way . '' They both laugh . Nic 's funny sometimes .
JULES: We could do a kind of a Secret Garden thing with trellises and topiary or something more Asian , minimal , with a rock garden feel . It 's up to you
PAUL: What do you think ?
JULES: Personally , I 'm tired of minimal . I 'm into more is more . Let 's not try to tame the space . I think it would look great all lush and overgrown and fecund
PAUL: Fecund ?
JULES: I 'm sorry , you know , fertile
PAUL: No , I love that word . You just do n't hear it that often . More is more . Yeah . Let 's do that . Jules is staring at Paul .
JULES: Sorry , I just keep seeing my kids in your expressions Jules looks more intensely at Paul 's face .
PAUL: You think so ?
JULES: Yeah .
NIC: What 's the score ?
JULES: Pretty close .
LASER: 20-3match point .
NIC: So how 'd it go today ?
JULES: Great . We settled on a concept .
NIC: What is it ?
JULES: It 's hard to explain . You have to kind of see the space to get it .
NIC: Laser , did you write Pup-pup a Get Well card ? Laser ! What do I have to do ? ! I ought you a card . I left it on your desk . All you had to do was
LASER: Mom , settle ! I will
NIC: Do n't tell me to settle , mister . And if it 's not in the mail by tomorrow morning , we 're not going to the Dodger game Saturday .
LASER: Whatever , I have other plans anyway .
NIC: What other plans ? I 'm asking you a quest
LASER: I said I 'd do something with Paul !
NIC: You used to be so cute !
PAUL: This may not be a good idea .
LASER: I think he may be right , dude . Maybe this is n't such a good idea .
CLAY: Will you quit being a man-gina and un the camera ! I 'm only doing this once so keep my shit in frame !
LASER: Seriously , dude , are you okay ?
CLAY: I 'm fucking fine ! Fuck ! Did you fucking get it ? !
PAUL: Maybe next time we can hang out just you and me .
LASER: Clay 's cool . He 's just gets a little amped sometimes .
PAUL: That 's not amped . That 's being a dick .
LASER: He 's not a dick , that 's just his way .
PAUL: OkayI just did n't like the way he was talking to you .
LASER: Well , you do n't know him .
PAUL: You 're rightI do n't
LASER: Hey , can I ask you a question ?
PAUL: Sure .
LASER: Why 'd you donate sperm ?
PAUL: Well , it 's a lot more fun then donating blood .
LASER: So you did it to help people ?
PAUL: It was a long time ago
LASER: How much did you get paid ?
PAUL: Why do you want to know ?
LASER: I 'm just curious .
PAUL: I do n't know , like 60 bucks a pop .
LASER: That 's it ?
PAUL: It was worth more back then . You know . With inflation Hey , I 'm glad I did it
SASHA: Hello ? Donor Dad ? Stone cold fox .
JAI: Must you take everything beautiful and make it dirty ?
SASHA: I 'm just saying . Spermster 's a hottie . Is he single ?
JONI: Okay , first of all , ewww . Second , he 's a really good person and I 'd prefer it if you did n't taint him with your whore juice . Sasha hops up , energized by the banter .
SASHA: Fair enough , hairy muff . I 'm outta here . You love birds can split my letters
JONI: You want to keep playing ?
JAI: Sure .
JONI: Yeah
JAI: It 's like she has to sexualize every experience , you know ? It 's just sad That stops Joni in her tracks .
JONI: Yeah , it is . It 's really sad .
JULES: Wow . What 's this ?

NIC: No , we 're planning on being here through mid-August so No , I promise , I 'm not going anywhere . Jules ' face drops ; she turns and leaves .
JULES: Look , I 'm gon na go to the nursery in the morning so we should probably make sure you 're signed off on the Bougainvillea
PAUL: Strawberry rhubarb pie . Fresh from my garden .
JULES: Oh my god . That is criminal .
PAUL: Have more .
JULES: No , please , just take it away
PAUL: You had one bite .
JULES: I have another you may as well just tape it to my ass cause that 's where it 'll end up .
PAUL: Hey now , do n't go negative on you ass . Jules blushes at all this talk of her ass .
JULES: Soyou 're good with the plants ? Look , we do n't have to do that . We could do go in a totally different direction if you
PAUL: No , I 'm just thinking . Hang on . Yeah , I 'm good with the plants .
JULES: Sorry . Sometimes I mistake silence for criticism .
PAUL: I was n't criticizing you .
JULES: No , I knowI just Sometimes Nic can be a little critical , you know . She 's a perfectionist .
PAUL: That does n't mean you have to be negative .
JULES: What 's up ?
LUIS: 5 o'clock .

LUIS: Same time tomorrow ?
JULES: Yes ! Same time !
PAUL: Same time tomorrow ? Jules pushes Paul , laughing .

JULES: What do you mean ?
NIC: I do n't know . Did you break ground ? Did you dig in ? I do n't know the terms .
JULES: No , we just talkedconceptually .
NIC: Oh , so it was less of a `` doing '' day , huh ? Was he okay with that ?
JULES: You know , maybe we should lay off the Paul digs a little .
NIC: Okay . You 're right .
JULES: And I also think we should start composting .
PAUL: You got your mom 's fair skin . You did n't get my Mediterranean genes
JONI: Thanks
PAUL: Who 's that ?
JONI: My mom , Nic . She 's making me insane .
PAUL: Why ? What 's she doing ?
JONI: She 's treating me like I 'm 12 . It 's like she does n't want to admit I 'm an adult .
PAUL: She 's your mom . That 's her job .
JONI: What ? To smother me to death ? That 's not her job .
PAUL: Well , if you want things to be different , you 've got to make that happen . That 's your job .
CLAY: That jump was cake , dude ! I so could 've made it .
LASER: You were like 20 feet short , dude ! There was no way .
CLAY: Yeah , well if Paul was n't there I could have landed it . That guy creeps me out .
LASER: Whatever .
CLAY: He 's kind of a fag , dude . Tryin ' to act all like your dad and shit .
LASER: Hey buddy . Good boy .
CLAY: Let 's pee on his head .
LASER: What ?
CLAY: Come on . Hold him Clay yanks the dog by his scruff .
LASER: Dude , Quit it !
CLAY: Duuude , quit it !
LASER: Go ! Run ! Get out of here ! The dog TAKES OFF . Clay shoves Laser .

LASER: Why are you such a dick ? !
PAUL: Here , put this on .
JULES: Relax . She 'll get home when she gets home .
NIC: Quit telling me to relax !
JONI: Mom
NIC: You know how many people I 've seen come into the hospital paralyzed from motorcycle accidents ? !
PAUL: I 'm a very safe rider
NIC: That is so not the point I 'm making ! Joni knows this is something I 'd never allow .
JONI: Mom , I 'm 18 years old ! I wo n't even be living here in like next month !
NIC: Yeah , well , you 're living here now !
JONI: Yeah , well why do n't you get a jump on it and pretend like I 'm not ! Joni storms off . Nic glowers at Paul .
NIC: She 's never talked to me like that .
PAUL: You know , Nic . If you eased up on the restrictions , maybe there 'd be less tension
NIC: Really ? You think so , Paul ? Is that how it works ? Jules walks up to intervene .
JULES: What 's going on ?
NIC: Oh , nothing . Paul 's just giving me child-rearing lessons .
PAUL: I was just saying
NIC: Listen , when you 've been a parent for 18 years , come talk to me !
PAUL: I was just making an observation .
NIC: Yeah , and I need your observations like I need a dick in my ass !
NIC: Joni ? I was just upset . You know how I feel about motorcycles . Joni opens the door .
JONI: I know how you feel about them . But I 'm an adult now and you have to respect that . Goodnight . Joni closes the door on her .
JULES: Paul ?
PAUL: Hey . What 's up ?
JULES: Look , I 'm sorry about last night . I 'm really embarrassed .
PAUL: Do n't be . She 's the one who wigged out .
JULES: I know , she 's just going through a lot of stuff right now
PAUL: Jules , it 's okay . You do n't have to defend her . They stare at each other , unsure how to act .
JULES: And look , I just want you to know , about the other day , the kiss , that 's not something Ido .
PAUL: Yeah , I sensed that . She takes a step toward him , feverish .
JULES: I just wanted to clear the air .
PAUL: The air is clear .
JULES: Paul , I ca n't !
PAUL: You do n't want to ? !
JULES: No , I do ! It 's just I have a guy outside !

PAUL: What ?
JULES: Nothing .
LUIS: Where do you want the stones ?
JULES: The stones ? Over by the fence .
LASER: That 's H .
PAUL: I know .
LASER: Lay-up .
PAUL: Hey , do n't take it easy on me cause you 're winning
LASER: Hey , can I ask you a question ?
PAUL: Oh god . Okay . Hit me .
LASER: When you die do you want to be uried or cremated ?
PAUL: That 's your question ?
LASER: I want to be cremated .
PAUL: I think I 'd rather be buried .
LASER: Why ? That 's just taking up more space in the earth .
PAUL: I do n't know , something about the idea of being burned into this chalky powder and sprinkled
LASER: What do you care ? You wo n't even e conscious .
PAUL: That 's true . I guess I just want to be in a place where people can visit me .
LASER: But why ? ! You 'll be dead ! You wo n't even know they 're there !
SASHA: God , I love your necklace ! Where 'd you get it ?
TANYA: I do n't know , some flea market
SASHA: In Africa ?
TANYA: No , more like Pasadena .
SASHA: Well , it 's really awesome .
PAUL: Sorry guys , I need to steal Tanya ack now .
SASHA: That 's okay , Paul .
TANYA: Well ladies , it was fun talking with you .
SASHA: Okay , I 'm sorry but your dono daddy is giving me the sex vibe .
JONI: No he 's not . He would n't do that .
SASHA: Why not ? He 's not my dad .
JONI: God Sasha , that 's totally gross ! Not everybody wants to have sex with you , okay ? Especially when you act like a slut .
SASHA: Fuck you .
JONI: Well it makes you seem insecure and desperate .
SASHA: I 'm not insecure and desperate ! I 'm just a normal sexual person ! And maybe you 'd get that if you were n't so uptight !
JONI: Fuck you . I 'm not uptight !
STELLA: Oh my god , these heirloom tomatoes are insane .
JULES: Joni brought some home from Paul 's garden the other day . They were huge ! Nic tightens at the mention of Paul .
JOEL: So , the kids have been spending time with him ?
NIC: Oh , yeah , they 're spending all kinds of quality time together .
STELLA: Well , it 's great they like him so much . You know , you hear these stories about kids meeting thei donors and the guys end up being nothing like they were on paper .
NIC: No , everyone 's getting along famously . Apparently Paul can do no wrong Nic grabs a passing waiter by the arm .
STELLA: Hey , have you guys tried those Açai fruit packs ?
JULES: No , but they 're pushing them like crack at Whole Foods .
STELLA: I know . Joel 's addicted .
JOEL: What I do is I throw one in the lender with some bananas , frozen strawberries and hemp milk and I 'll tell you , it 's sensational . Nic slaps her forehead .
NIC: Oh , just fucking kill me Everyone stiffens . Jules is embarrassed .
JULES: Honey
NIC: I 'm sorry guys , but I just ca n't , with the fucking hemp milk and the organic farming and heirloom tomatoes . `` Oh no , do n't throw that in the trash , no man , you got ta throw that into the composting bin so the fucking worms can shit all over it and turn it into glorious multch and we can all feel better about ourselves . '' God ! What a bunch of ullshit !
JULES: How about some green tea , honey Nic slams her glass on the table . Explodes .
NIC: You know what , Jules ? ! I like my wine ! Okay ? So fucking sue me ! And fyi , red wine has a chemical called Resveratrol in it , which has een proven to significantly extend human lifespan !
JULES: Yeah , if you drink a thousand ottles a day !

JULES: I 'm sorry .
NIC: This whole Paul thing is driving me crazy ! I feel like he 's taking over my family .
JULES: No . He 's not !
NIC: Okay ! Okay . I 'm sorry . I 'm just exhausted
JULES: Maybe you need to take some time off and recharge .
NIC: Sure , and who 's gon na pay for that ? Jules looks pissed off , and hurt .
JULES: Because that 's the way you like it ! That 's the way you keep control ! This is Jules ' break-point .
NIC: What are you talking about ?
JULES: Oh come on ! You hated it when I worked ! You wanted me at home , taking care of the kids . You wanted a wife !
NIC: That is just not true !
JULES: You did n't trust any of those nannies ! And you sure as hell did n't back my career !
NIC: What are you talking about ? I just helped you start another business !
JULES: Yeah , so you can feel better about yourself !
NIC: No , so you can feel better about yourself !
JULES: Are you even attracted to me anymore ?
BARTENDER: Do you still want this ?
NIC: No . Just the check please .
JULES: God , I feel so drugular right now . I really want a cigarette ! Do you have any ? I have n't had a cigarette since Laser was born . Do you smoke ?
PAUL: Sometimes . But I do n't have any here . Want me to run to the store ?

JULES: That was fast !
LUIS: Yeah , no lines .

JULES: The look you 're giving me right now !
LUIS: That 's no look . That just my face .
JULES: Look , I 'm not gon na play this game with you ! You need to keep you judgements to yourself !
LUIS: Senora , I did n't give no looks !
JULES: I do n't ask you why you keep lowing your nose constantly ! I mean , if you have a drug problem that 's your business
LUIS: I do n't have no drug problem ! I have the allergies !
JULES: Then why are you a gardener ? ! Luis stares at Jules , innocent .
LUIS: Cause I love the flowers .
JULES: Look , this is n't gon na work . I 'll pay you through the end of the day and then we 're done . Jules walks past a totally confused Luis .
NIC: Look , I know you 've all been enjoying your time with Paul . And I know I have n't been as open to him as everyone else and this has caused somefrictionbetween us . But I 'd like to try and change that
PAUL: How 's it going ?

PAUL: Oh yeah ?
TANYA: Yeah Tanya moves imperceptibly closer .
PAUL: Yeah , it 's been a while .
TANYA: You want to meet up later ?
PAUL: Tanya , you 're so sexy and eautiful , but I do n't think we should do that anymore . Tanya 's face drops .
TANYA: What happened ?
PAUL: You know , our thing is really fun and easy , butI do n't want to be 50 and still `` hanging out . '' You know ? If I really want a family then I have to stop getting in these situations that do n't go anywhere . Paul just looks at her . Tanya gets it .
TANYA: Oh .

JULES: Mmm-hmmm .
NIC: And it 's done to perfection .
PAUL: So it 's not too rare ?
NIC: No , it 's perfect . Juicy . Tender . Exactly what rare 's supposed to be .
PAUL: Good . A lot of people in the estaurant order a steak rare and they freak out at the slightest sight of red .
NIC: Ugh , is n't that annoying ? That happens to me all the time when I 'm grilling .
PAUL: Do n't people know that rare means ed ?
NIC: Right ? ! It means bloody !
PAUL: Exactly ! They should see what rare looks like in Argentina . The cow 's practically still mooing .
JONI: I really want to go to Argentina . Buenos Aires is supposed to be

LASER: You 're right . I 'm sorry , mom .
NIC: I like this guy . Paul looks at Joni .
PAUL: You did n't tell me you were named after Joni M .

PAUL: Just around there .
NIC: You know what ? I think I will try some of that Screaming Eagle .
JULES: Well , you and Paul seemed to get on like gang-busters
NIC: You 're sleeping with him , are n't you .
JULES: What ? Nic turns to her , eyes red with anger .
NIC: Just be honest with me . Do n't make me feel crazier than I feel right now !
JULES: Where is this coming from ? !
NIC: I found your hair in his drain !
JULES: What ? I was working . I got dirty so I took a shower .
NIC: Oh yeah ? You take a nap , too ?
JULES: No !

NIC: Oh , right , so it 's my fault !
JULES: No ! Who said anything about fault ? Just listen to me !
NIC: I 'm listening ! What ? !
JULES: I just needed
NIC: What ? To be fucked ?
JULES: No , appreciated !
NIC: It 's always what I 'm not doing fo you , is n't it ? Well here 's what I do n't to you . I do n't work out my issues by fucking other people !
JULES: He 's not just `` other people ! ''
NIC: No , you had to go fuck our sperm donor ! You could n't have picked a more painful way to hurt me
JULES: Where are you going ? !
NIC: I need water ! My mouth is dry !
JULES: Hey Laser . Honey ? Laser turns over , semi-conscious .
LASER: What ? She sits down on his bed .

BUDD: Not in El Paso it ai n't . In El Pso I got me 250 Dollars for it .
BILL: Since it was a gift from me , why did n't you offer me the chance to uy it back ?
BUDD: Because that would 've required me to acknowledge your existence . Drunken bum though I may be , I do n't need booze that bad . But who the hell gives a crap anyway . That itch ai n't gittin no Bushido points for killin a white trash piece of shit like me with a samurai sword . I 'm a bouncer in a titty bar , Bill . If she wants to fight me , all she got ta do is come down to the Club , start some shit , and we 'll be in a a fight .
BILL: Budd , you need to listen to me . I know we have n't spoken for quite some time , and the last time we spoke was n't the most pleasant . But you need to get over being mad at me , and start becoming afraid of Bea . Because she is coming , and she 's coming to kill you . And unless you accept my assistance , I have no doubt she will succeed .
BUDD: And what would that happy side be ?
BILL: She 's brought `` the boys '' back together .
BUDD: I appreciate the concern on you face , but there 's a difference 'tween `` the boys '' , time ca n't erase . I do n't dodge guilt . And I do n't Jew outta payin my comeuppance .

THE BRIDE: Did he teach you that ?
BILL: No . He teaches no one the ten-point palm - exploding heart technique . But he is Nietzsche 's psalm personified . If Pai Mei does n't kill you , he will make you stronger . Now one of the things I always liked about you , Kiddo , is you appear wise beyond your years . Then allow me to impart , a word to the wise . Whatever - WHAT - EVER - Pai Mei says , Obey . If you flash him - even for an instant - a defiant eye , he 'll pluck it out . And if you throw any American sass his way , he will snap your back and your neck like they were twigs , and that will be the story of you .
THE BRIDE: Caught him in a good mood , aye ?
BILL: More like a sadistic one .
THE BRIDE: Why did he accept me ?
BILL: Because he 's a very very very old man . And like all rotten bastards , when they get old , they become lonely . Not that that has any effect on their disposition . But they do learn the value of company .

BILL: That 's the title of my favorite soul song of the Seventies .
THE BRIDE: What ?
BILL: Nothing . When he tells me you 're done .
THE BRIDE: When do you think that might be ?
BILL: That my dearest , all depends on you . Now remember , no backtalk , no sarcasm . Least not for the first year . You 're going to have to let him warm up for you . He hates Caucasians , despises Americans , and has nothing but contempt for women , so in your case , that may take a little while . Adios .

PAI MEI: And you could shoot a man from a ooftop with a scope-sight rifle , if you so desired , but this is not what I asked . What if your enemy is three inches in front of you , what do you do then ? Curl into a ball ? Or do you put your fist through him . He HITS the wall again leaving another hole .

BILL: Well , if she does n't like you , you got to kill her to say hello . But if she likes you , you ca n't shut her up . She 's a chip off the ole londe in that regards . He holds up the bottle of vino .

BILL: Well not you , that 's for damn sure . She gives him another look .
THE BRIDE: Must we have to endure your little zingers ?
BILL: No we must n't . But if you 're going to say sentences like that , in the future , I will resist the temptation .
THE BRIDE: Baby , you do n't have a future . Bill drinks some wine .
BILL: I sent you to L.A. and you neve came back . I thought you 'd been killed . Do you know how cruel it is to make someone think someone they love is dead ? I mourned you . Then in the third month of my mourning , I track you down . I was n't trying to track you down , I was trying to track down - the fucking assholes - who I thought killed you . And when I find you , what to I find ? Not only are you not dead , you 're getting married - to some fuckin jerk - and you 're pregnant ? How do you expect me to react ?
THE BRIDE: Why do you think I hid ?
BILL: Why did you leave in the first place ? You have cold eyes towards me now . I understand thei temperature , but they were warm the second to the last time I saw them , or was that just my imagination ?
THE BRIDE: No .
BILL: You 're right , I 'm wrong , continue .
THE BRIDE: The morning I left , I threw up . I do n't feel like speaking in Japanese anymore - on the plane , I threw up . When I got to my hotel , I threw up . So naturally I started thinking , maybe I might be pregnant . So I bought one of those home pregnancy kits . Went back to my room and took the test . The little strip said blue . I was going to have a baby . I tried to call you , but you were n't there , so I just thought I 'd call back later .
BILL: But you never did .
THE BRIDE: - Would you shut up , I 'm trying to tell you how I feel .
BILL: My apologies , please continue .
THE BRIDE: So I just figured I 'd call you back later . I was just so happy , I put on music and danced by myself in the hotel suite , holding my little lue strip . What I did n't know , was at some leg of my journey , I was spotted . With me in Los Angeles it did n't take Lisa Wong long to figure out someone put a hit out on her . So she sent an assassin of her own to
HOTEL WOMAN: Hello , I 'm Karen Kim , I 'm the hospitality manager of the hotel . I have a welcome gift from the management . Seeing it through the peephole .
THE BRIDE: Oh , it 's beautiful . But I 'm kinda usy at this second , could you possibly come back later ?
KAREN: So you came here to kill Lisa Wong , huh ? Well that 's my sister , bitch . I 'm Karen Wong , and I 've come here to kill you .
THE BRIDE: Wait a second ! Karen stops .
KAREN: Oh , I know you 're not
THE BRIDE: - listen to me ! I just found out , ight now - not two minutes before you blew a hole in the door , I 'm pregnant . Karen looks at her , `` what ? `` .
KAREN: What is this , bullshit story numbe twelve in the female assassin 's handbook ?
THE BRIDE: Any other time you 'd be a hundred percent right . But this time you 're a hundred percent wrong . I 'm the deadliest woman in the world , but ight now I 'm scared shitless fo my baby . Please , you hafta believe me . Look at the strip , it 's on the floor .
KAREN: Sit down on that bed and put you hands behind your head .
THE BRIDE: Blue means pregnant .
KAREN: I 'll read it myself , thank you . It is blue , Karen 's starting to believe her .
THE BRIDE: Just go home . I 'll do the same .
KAREN: You fucked with the Wong sisters .
THE BRIDE: Facing Karen Wong , was the most frightening moment I have eve experienced . And that includes three years with that evil bastard Pai Mei . Before that strip turned lue , I was a woman , I was you woman . I was a killer , who killed for you . Before that strip turned lue , I would have jumped a motorcycle on to a speeding train for you . But once that strip turned blue , I could no longer do any of those things . Not anymore . Because now I was a mother . A mother who only had one thought on her mind . Please do n't harm my aby . Can you understand that ?
BILL: Yes . But why tell me now , and not then ?
THE BRIDE: You would n't have let me go . Specially once you found out I was pregnant . You would 've tried to talk me out of it . It would have een a big scene . I just said fuck it . Starting to get mad .
BILL: Fuck who ?
THE BRIDE: Bill , you could n't know I was pregnant , once you knew , you 'd claim it , and I did n't want that .
BILL: That 's not your decision to make .
THE BRIDE: Yes , but it 's the right decision . And I made it for my daughter . Everybody on this earth deserves to start with a clean slate . But with us - my daughter would be born into a world she should n't be . Robbing her of the one thing everybody deserves . She would be born with lood stains . I had to choose . I chose her .
BILL: I 'm sorry was that a question ? Of impossible things that could neve happen - yes in this instance you would have been wrong . The Bride listens stoney , then ;
THE BRIDE: Well ?
BILL: Well what ?
THE BRIDE: Explain yourself .
BILL: I already have . When I told you the story of when I thought you were dead . Did n't you get how badly I felt ?
THE BRIDE: You call that an explanation ?
BILL: Well if that 's too cryptic let 's get literal . There are consequences to breaking the heart of a murdering bastard . You experienced some of them . That 's his explanation . She hears it . They both understand one another .
THE BRIDE: You and I have unfinished business .
BILL: Baby , you ai n't kidding . They both laugh .
THE BRIDE: Yes .
BILL: You know I was rooting for you , do n't you ?
THE BRIDE: I figured .
BILL: You know on that beach out there I want you to be the victor ? She nods her head , yes .
THE BRIDE: It wo n't be necessary for you to give me anything . I 've surpassed you . I 'll take it .
BILL: Well , as they say in Missouri , show me .
BILL: That 's my girl .
THE BRIDE: Of course he did .
BILL: Why did n't you tell me ? She does n't have an answer . She looks at him apologetically ;
THE BRIDE: I do n't knowBecauseI 'm abad person .
BILL: No . You 're not a bad person . You 're a terrific person . You 're my favorite person . But every once in awhileyou can be a real cunt . They smile at each other . Then Bill turns his back to her

PROFESSOR STEEVES: You want life ? You want the world on fire ? Steeves motions to the door . Then to Allen .
LUCIEN: `` The rose that scents the summe air/ grows from my beloved 's hair ? ''
ALLEN: Keep going . That 's my sonnet fo Steeves .
LUCIEN: We have the map . We have the manifesto . We need the work . I was wrong . Maybe you 're not up for this after all .
ALLEN: Show me your fucking map .
LUCIEN: Stop !
ALLEN: Oh right , you do n't have anything ecause David 's not here to write it for you ! Lucien stands up , drunk . Furious .
LUCIEN: It 's complicated .
ALLEN: I love complicated . Lucien steadies himself . Furious .
LUCIEN: He 's a professor working as a janitor so he can be near his precious Lu-Lu . He is a goddamn fruit who wo n't let me go .
ALLEN: A fruit ?
LUCIEN: A queer .
ALLEN: Then let 's get rid of him .
LUCIEN: Right now , I just need you to write us something beautiful . First thought , best thought .
BILL: The Germans call it the `` wonde drug . '' Prescribed for super-human feats .
LUKE: What the hell are you doing ? Allen , furious at the interruption .
ALLEN: Writing !
BILL: But the words , oh the words
ALLEN: Lu ! It 's very rough but
DAVID: Ah . The `` Vision '' at last . Can I see ? Allen hides them behind his back .
ALLEN: Where 's Lu ?
DAVID: He 's out . With a senior , some football player . A writer and handsome too . James ? Jack . There it is . Jack .
ALLEN: You 're not allowed to be here .
DAVID: That 's odd since I 'm the only thing keeping him here .
ALLEN: Not anymore .
DAVID: Piece of advice . You do n't know Lu . As soon you think you do , he 'll find someone else .
LUCIEN: What are you , moving in ?
ALLEN: Where have you been ? ! Lucien starts getting undressed .
LUCIEN: I found a real writer . Already a million words under his belt before Columbia .
ALLEN: You mean Jack ? Lucien fumbles .
LUCIEN: What am I supposed to do ? Newsreels ? He spots the piece of paper in Allen 's hand .
ALLEN: Nothing . Lucien gets into bed .
LUCIEN: If you 're going to stay , do n't hog the blanket .
ALLEN: Why is Jack a real writer ?
LUCIEN: Once you meet him , you 'll see what I mean .
ALLEN: No .
JACK: The damn cat !
LUCIEN: What do you think ? Brilliant , no ?
ALLEN: It 's missing some periods and commas .
LUCIEN: It 's better than anything you 've ever written .
ALLEN: I use periods and commas .
JACK: Both of you ! Quiet !
LUCIEN: Who 's Sammy ?
JACK: My best friend since I was twelve . Off in the Navy .
EDIE: I did n't know we were having guests .
JACK: What 's this ?
EDIE: I was aiming for stew .
JACK: You missed . Jack grabs his jacket .
EDIE: Where are you going ?
JACK: Out .
EDIE: Out ? I cooked all day for you .
JACK: What do you want me to do ? Eat shoe leather ? I 'm hungry and what you do in the kitchen is unholy .
EDIE: That 's funny . You talk like a Catholic . But you fuck me and wo n't marry me . How does that work ? Allen and Lucien watch entranced .
JACK: Shut your mouth , Edie .
EDIE: I thought you liked it WIDE OPEN
JACK: So Al . You thought my novel was shit ?
ALLEN: Not exactly . It 's
LUCIEN: It 's all true . Jack served in the Merchant Marines .
JACK: I 've left school twice already . Columbia 's full of squares . I 'm not even sure why I bothered to come ack .
ALLEN: Then why do n't you just ship out again ?
JACK: Trust me . Sometimes when I fight with Edie , I want to .
LUCIEN: You two did just fight .
JACK: Carr , you 're goddamn crazy .
ALLEN: Yeah .
JACK: Sounds phony . Movements are cooked up by people who ca n't write about the people who can .
LUCIEN: Lu , I do n't think he gets what we 're trying to do .
JACK: Listen to me , this whole town 's full of finks on the 30th floor , writing pure chintz . Writers , real writers , got ta be in the beds . In the trenches . In all the broken places . What 're your trenches , Al ?
ALLEN: Allen .
JACK: Right . Allen looks to Lucien for help .
LUCIEN: First thought , best thought .
ALLEN: Fuck you . What does that even mean ? !
JACK: Good . That 's one . What else ?
ALLEN: Fuck your one million words .
JACK: Even better .
ALLEN: You do n't know me .
JACK: You 're right . Who is you ?
ALLEN: Be careful . You are not in wonderland I have heard the strange madness long growing in your soul . But you are fortunate .
JACK: Allen . Beautiful , kid . Allen looks up , moved .
LUCIEN: You wrote that ?
ALLEN: You asked me to . Remember ?
LUCIEN: Forget Columbia . Forget Ogden Nash . Here 's the plan , boys . We join the Merchant Marines . Sail the world until the war ends . Then jump ship and make it to Paris . For the liberation .
ALLEN: You do n't speak French .
LUCIEN: Jack does . It 'll be us , together . At the beginning . It 'll be the perfect day . A FLOOD-LAMP and HORN shatter the reverie .
POLICE OFFICER: Do n't MOVE !
JACK: Jesus Christ !
POLICE OFFICER: Put your hands in the air !
DEAN: Your attendance record here is abominable . You 've ignored curfew . Your papers , when you bother to turn them in , exceed the assigned page limit . Can you explain why you 're at Columbia ?
LUCIEN: Same reason you 're here .
DEAN: What 's that ?
LUCIEN: Loose Barnard girls .
DEAN: I know about your difficulties . About what happened in Chicago .
LUCIEN: You told him ? !
MARION CARR: He 's not the enemy .
DEAN: See , the University acts in loco parentis . You are ou esponsibility . We 're trying to find someway to make this all work . Lucien EXPLODES .
LUCIEN: Who said anybody could know anything about anything ? !
MARION CARR: Lucien , your temper !
ALLEN: Who 's she ?
EDITH: Hi . I 'm Edith Cohen .
ALLEN: What 's she doing here ?
EDITH: I 'll go wait outside . Edith exits down the stairs .
ALLEN: So that 's why you locked mom up . Louis SLAPS his son .
LOUIS: Did he put you up to this ?
ALLEN: No . I stole the boat . And it was tremendous .
LUCIEN: You know me now . I 'm only good at eginnings .
ALLEN: You 're dropping out ?
LUCIEN: Best of luck .
ALLEN: My father shows up yesterday with some new woman . And in the middle of the Allen's-a-screw-up monologue , all of a sudden , I ealize I do n't care . I 've neve not cared . So , I told them it was my idea . To steal the boat .
LUCIEN: Why ?
ALLEN: Because I do n't want to be the person they think I am . I 'm on academic probation . I could be kicked out . You ca n't leave . You started something and I have no idea what I 'm supposed to do next . Lucien , moved .
PERMISSIONS LIBRARIAN: You must not drink while you 're handling it . And no writing in it .
JACK: No telling Edie , got it ?
BILL: 25 seconds . Masterful .
LUCIEN: Damn ! Shift 's over .
ALLEN: I 'll go .
GWENDOLYN: Sure .
ALLEN: I 'm looking for a book .
GWENDOLYN: Okay . Does this book have a title ?
ALLEN: It 's called The Day Amanda Came .
GWENDOLYN: Well , you 'll have to wait . I ca n't leave the desk .
ALLEN: ButI really need it . Gwendolyn looks around .
GWENDOLYN: Okay . Only for you .
LUCIEN: Shit !
ALLEN: Working here must be a drag .
GWENDOLYN: I like it . It 's the only way I meet oys . They 're very strict at Barnard .
ALLEN: How strict ?
GWENDOLYN: For example , they 'd never let me do this .
ALLEN: Right . No .
BILL: Go ! Lucien races into the stacks after Allen .
GWENDOLYN: Did you know I 've never done it with someone who was Jewish before ? I really want to know what it looks like .
ALLEN: There is no book . Take it off .
GWENDOLYN: Really ?
ALLEN: No .
GWENDOLYN: Liar . If you have done it before , you 'll last for thirty seconds . Start counting .
ALLEN: 12
GWENDOLYN: I knew it .
ALLEN: I do .
DAVID: Excuse me . I think I saw some light or movement in the library .
JACK: What just happened ?
GUARD: Did you hear that ?
SECURITY GUARD: We know you 're here !
ALLEN: Wait . Lucien .
LUCIEN: No . Not yet , we have to finish .
SECURITY GUARD: Do n't move . It 's over .
LUCIEN: Get off of me ! Allen ! Help !
SECURITY GUARD: Open the goddamn door ! Open this up !
TOUR GUIDE: The South Hall library is a church , and these are the sacraments .
LUCIEN: To literacy .
ALLEN: Jack , that 's you , is n't it ?
JACK: Yep . Last year . They still won .
LUCIEN: Look at them !
JACK: Have no fear . You never will .
ALLEN: What 's he doing here ? David walks briskly over to Lucien .
DAVID: Since you did n't show up earlier , I just hoped to give you this .
ALLEN: Maybe he did n't want to see you .
DAVID: I think he can speak for himself .
LUCIEN: Yup . And he says we should all have another round
DAVID: You 've had plenty of time to celebrate . Your library hijink made the morning paper . I 'm sure you 're all very proud .
ALLEN: How did you know it was us ?
DAVID: Did he use that `` Bastille '' line ? Cause I gave it to him . Allen , Jack and Bill look at Lucien , shocked .
LUCIEN: I have n't seen you for days .
DAVID: You left this at my place .
ALLEN: You told the guards we were there . No one else knew .
JACK: You little fink ! Lucien explodes at David .
LUCIEN: You wanted me to get kicked out ? ! You ratted on me !
DAVID: Stop , Lu . You 're losing control again . You know what comes next . I know what comes next .
ALLEN: Yeah . Cut him off . Lucien gives David a fatal look .
LUCIEN: Best of luck , Janitor .
DAVID: Excuse me ?
LUCIEN: We are over . Leave .
DAVID: Look at me , Lu .
BILL: Let 's go .
DAVID: You said I was everything to you . You are everything to me . Everything to me . Do you hear me ?
BILL: Let 's go . Time and place , David .
DAVID: Shut up , traitor .
LUCIEN: You 'd be boring if it were n't fo me ! The two start to crack up together .
JACK: Andgo !
LUCIEN: Jack ? Jack ? He broke his fucking neck . The warrior poet has passed on .
ALLEN: No , he lives !
LUCIEN: Excellent ! Judges award a Allen holds up nine fingers .
ALLEN: Nine !
LUCIEN: All right Ginsy , your turn .
ALLEN: First thought , best thought .
LUCIEN: Let 's go , Jack .
JACK: Wait , Al , you coming ? Lucien glares at Allen .
LUCIEN: No . Allen 's got work to do . Ten pages on Spengler 's Decline of the West . Due tomorrow .
ALLEN: Excuse me ?
LUCIEN: I 'd be lost without you , Ginsy . Come on , Lion .
ALLEN: Fuck . Fuck !
JACK: Edie ! Edie bird !
LUCIEN: Lu 's going to use the loo .
EDIE: Say hi to Gram . Grandma Frankie glares at Jack .
JACK: Then we should have a drink ! How about a drink , Grandma Frankie ? You want some red wine ? Jack heads to the cabinet . Edie follows him .
EDIE: Where the hell have you been ? !
JACK: I was out . Edie 's rage boils over .
EDIE: I packed all your stuff . It 's in your bag . I 'm going to be at Gram 's tonight . Jack reaches for her . She shakes him off .
JACK: Stay . I 'm sorry .
EDIE: You just say that , but it 's one of your million words and they do n't mean anything ! Just do n't be here when I come back in the morning .
DAVID: I know this is crazy . I do n't know even know what I 'm doing here . But I had to tell you I 'm sorry . Let me make it up to you . From behind
LUCIEN: I 'm going back to bed . Another word and I call the police .
JACK: What the hell ? !
LUCIEN: It was David .
JACK: I 'll wring his fucking neck .
LUCIEN: I have another idea .
ALLEN: Your paper and my apology .
LUCIEN: Sailing out . To Paris .
ALLEN: You were n't going to tell me ?
LUCIEN: We both know why you ca n't come .
ALLEN: Fuck you . You 're a phony . You got me and Jack and Bill making you vision come true . All because you could n't do it yourself .
LUCIEN: No , you got what you wanted . You were ordinary , just like every other freshman , and I made you life extraordinary . Go be you now , all by yourself . Leave me alone .
ALLEN: You do n't really mean that .
LUCIEN: Allen . Leave .
DAVID: Allen , have you seen him ? He 's not in his room . They look almost the same .
ALLEN: He left .
DAVID: I did something wrong . Really wrong . And you have no reason to help me . But
ALLEN: But ?
DAVID: I know who you are . We 're the ones he needs , but never wants . It hurts , does n't it ?
BILLETING OFFICER: Lem me see your papers .
LUCIEN: Two seamen , reporting for duty .
BILLETING OFFICER: What 's your name ?
LUCIEN: Arthur Rimbaud .
BILLETING OFFICER: Go upstairs to get on the docket .
LUCIEN: Let 's go get on the docket .
JACK: Goddamn son of a bitch !
LUCIEN: Let me handle this . Lucien holds Jack back , rushes up to David .
DAVID: Listen , I spoke to a guy upstairs . I got two passes . I packed for both of us . We can leave .
LUCIEN: The reason I 'm leaving is you .
DAVID: Then you and Jack take them . I 'll catch up .
LUCIEN: Come with me . We 're taking a walk .
ALLEN: Could I have a whiskey , please ?
JACK: I 'm sorry . Edie embraces him .
ALLEN: Lu ?
EDIE: This came for you today .
JACK: Sammy
EDIE: What is that ?
JACK: It 's Shelley 's elegy for Keats .
EDIE: What 's that mean ?
JACK: It means he 's dead .
POLICEMAN: He did n't come back here afterwards . Nobody on the floo saw .
DETECTIVE: So what do we know about this Ca kid ? Did we have any friends ? We 're gon na have to speak to all of them .
ALLEN: Edie ? Is Jack there ?
EDIE: The police took him down to the Tombs . As an accessory . Bill too .
LUCIEN: Allen , thank God .
ALLEN: How could you ?
LUCIEN: He wanted to hurt me , I had no choice .
ALLEN: You could have run . Called the police . Lucien looks Allen fiercely in the eye .
LUCIEN: Listen . Somehow he found me at the Marine Hall .
ALLEN: But how did Jack and Bill get roped into this ?
LUCIEN: The D.A . is asking for my deposition . In writing .
ALLEN: I 'll do it . Lucien , smiling . Leans in , whispers .
LUCIEN: We 're going to say it was an `` hono slaying '' . Off Allen 's confused face
JACK: Dad . It 's five thousand dollars fo ail . I know it 's a lot
MARION CARR: You must understand David has been following him for years .
ALLEN: But he did n't have to go with him .
MARION CARR: He spun a web to ensnare my son . That 's why I brought him here . A lot of good that did .
ALLEN: What happened in Chicago ?
MARION CARR: Thank God Lu has you in his life . He talks about you all the time .
ALLEN: That 's what he called David .
MARION CARR: That man ruined my son . You 're going to help me keep what 's left of him .
BILL: Contrary to reports , prison is not a tonic for the spirit .
ALLEN: And what did you tell them ?
BILL: I said yes .
ALLEN: Did David do something Lu in Chicago ?
BILL: Christ Allen , please do n't get involved .
ALLEN: I have to be . I 'm helping him write his defense . Bill paces , then turns to face Allen .
BILL: David was my friend . But he 's dead . And did Lucien tell you how he died ? Allen shakes his head . He has no idea .
MR. BURROUGHS: Who are you ? Is he part of this usiness .
BILL: Leave him alone , Dad .
MR. BURROUGHS: I paid your bail . Do n't talk to me like that .
BILL: Yes , sir .
MR. BURROUGHS: The car leaves in five minutes .
BILL: The libertine circle has come to an end .
NAOMI: He would leave me alone in the house . I was going to die there .
ALLEN: No , Mom . That 's not true .
NAOMI: Yeah , I know it .
ALLEN: Mom , stop .
NAOMI: Hey , I 'm okay now . I 'm your mother . And I 'm okay .
ALLEN: I 'm in over my head . Someone I know killed a man . And I do n't know what to do . He wants my help . And I do n't know if I should give it to him . I do n't know if it 's right . It 's just a mess .
NAOMI: Let him go . Do n't help him .
ALLEN: I ca n't , mom . He 's my best friend .
NAOMI: Listen to me .
DAVID: Let 's get out of the city . Anywhere you want . I 've saved up .
LUCIEN: I was just a kid , you dragged me into your perverted mess !
DAVID: How can you say that ? You know that 's not true . Lucien stops short . Stares hard at David .
LUCIEN: You 're pathetic .
DAVID: Now I know how you felt .
LUCIEN: When ?
DAVID: When you wanted to die .
LUCIEN: Or they destroy you .
ALLEN: Then tell the truth , Lu .
LUCIEN: You were n't even there . It 's you truth . It 's fiction .
ALLEN: Allen Ginsberg .
SECRETARY: He 'll be with you in a minute . Please , have a seat .
DEAN: No , please tell me . Professo Steeves says you submitted it as your final . Allen , nervous in the chair .
ALLEN: But you finished it . The Dean loses his patience .
DEAN: You 've taken incompletes in two classes . And you are already on academic probation . There are rules you agreed to upon admittance into this university . And you have managed to break and keep breaking them . You do n't seem to have much espect for this institution . So you may either retract this fiction as your final . Or you may choose to e expelled . What will it be ? Professor Steeves eyes Allen .
ALLEN: Fine . Allen stands , making his decision .
DEAN: This remains with us .
LOUIS: This came for you today .
ZED: Hotel Mondial .
CAB DRIVER: Le Mondial . Tres bien . He starts driving .
ZED: I do n't speak French . The driver turns around .
CAB DRIVER: Ah . American ?
ZED: That 's right .
CAB DRIVER: That 's good because I speak a little English . Zed nods .
ZED: What time is it ?
CAB DRIVER: Time , time , time . I do n't know . Daytime . Zed forgets the adjustment for now .
ZED: Yes .
CAB DRIVER: It 's a nice hotel . Your hotel . Very big ooms . He looks at Zed in the rear view mirror .
ZED: I 've been here once before . When I was younger . The cab driver smiles .
CAB DRIVER: Those were the days . They drive for a while .
ZED: I beg your pardon ?
CAB DRIVER: Do you have a wife ?
ZED: No . Why ?
CAB DRIVER: Well , if you need a wife for the night Une escorte . Pour vous faire visiter . For business . I give you my number . Very nice girl . French . Like when you were young .
BELLBOY: Your packageIt arrived in the last night of before last night . He points to the telephone .
ZED: Oh , wait . The bellboy turns around .
BELLBOY: What time is it ?
ZED: Time .
BELLBOY: Ah . Yes . Il est presque huit heures moins dix .
ZOEY: Bonjour .
ZED: Bonjour .
ZOEY: Wow . Vous avez une belle chambre . Je ne suis jamais venue dans cet hotel .
ZED: Ido n't speak French . She blows a bubble .
ZOEY: It 's okay . She takes a seat on the bed .
ZED: Well , let me just dry up .
ZOEY: Okay , but it 's not necessary .
ZED: What was that ? She notices his pants .
ZOEY: You can take those off . The pants .
ZED: I 'd rather watch you get undressed first .
ZOEY: Alright .
ZED: Slower . He lays down on the bed .
ZOEY: Alright Mister America . Zed .
ZED: Yes ?
ZOEY: Moises told me you were in town fo usiness .
ZED: Yes .
ZOEY: What kind of business ?
ZED: Why ?
ZOEY: I do n't know . I 'm just curious .
ZED: Do you ask all your clients questions ?
ZOEY: No . Just the ones I like .
ZED: So you like me ?
ZOEY: Yes .
ZED: Why ?
ZOEY: Because you'rea good person . I run into some real creeps . You know .
ZED: How do you know I 'm a good person ?
ZOEY: Body language . We fit together .
ZED: All men and women fit together . Hell , even some men fit together .
ZOEY: No , but you know , we clicked . You made me orgasm . Do you know how often I orgasm with a man Moises sets me up with ?
ZED: No I do n't .
ZOEY: Usually never . They 're almost always fat like pigs . Zed laughs at this .
ZED: I never really thought of it like that .
ZOEY: Well , it 's true . Zed nods at this .
ZED: Well , I like you too Zoe .
ZOEY: Honest ? He nods .
ZED: Well , I like your honesty . You 're open . Unlike most prostitutes I 've been with .
ZOEY: I am not a prostitute ! Zed is a little surprised at this .
ZED: Really ? Can I have my francs back then ?
ZOEY: I 'm a student . And to pay for the classes I became an escort . It 's my choice to sleep with you .
ZED: I see .
ZOEY: What ? You do n't understand .
ZED: No , I do .
ZOEY: Hey , it 's not easy .
ZED: I did n't say it was .
ZOEY: I 'm here because I want to .
ZED: Okay , okay relax . What school do you go to ?
ZOEY: The Centre du Art , Paris .
ZED: That 's really interesting . What kind of art do you study ?
ZOEY: Not any of the old shit .
ZED: Oh .
ZOEY: I have a day job too . Three times a week .
ZED: What kind of things do you paint ?
ZOEY: I do n't paint . I make things . Objects . Not like sculpture . Like lifebut with no narrative . I want when someone looks at one of my objects for there to be no eference to the world . Void of feeling , emotionvoid of destiny . Those are left for me . They belong only to me . If someone else can see into itthen it is no longer mine . I have failed . And I would destroy it . I do n't care how much cash they would offer me . It would be shit . I ca n't tell you how many objects of mine have been destroyed . They told too much about me . And if someone wants to know something about meI 'll tell them myself . The way I 'm telling you . She looks back at him .
ZED: I 'd like to see one of these .
ZOEY: What ? So you could see the work of a whore ?
ZED: Zoey . I 'm sorry for calling you a prostitute . I did n't understand the difference .
ZOEY: The difference is a prostitute would have lied to you about her orgasm . He gives her a kiss .
ZED: If these things you make are as true as you areI 'm sure they 're as indescribable . Perhaps , someday , you 'll make oneabout me .
ZOEY: If I doyou 'll never know which one it is . Because I 'll be the only one who understands . I 'll be the only one who can look into it and see where in my life it came from .
ZED: I have no idea . Night time . There is more pounding on the door .
ZOEY: I 'm going to take a shower .
ERIC: Hey you madman ! Zed 's happy to see him .
ZED: Eric . Come in . They hug .
ERIC: What happened to you ? I thought you were going to call .
ZED: Sorry , I asked the hotel to give me a wake up call .
ERIC: That 's good , but now I am here . So let 's go . We have a lot to talk about .
ZED: What about the girl ?
ERIC: Is she your girlfriend ?
ZED: No .
ERIC: Fuck her . He peeks into the bathroom .
ZED: I 'll let her stay here tonight .
ERIC: Do n't be silly . It 's dangerous . Eric walks into the bathroom .
ERIC: She shrieks .
ZED: Eric .
ERIC: Do n't worry about her . She bites his hand . He yells in pain .
ERIC: God damn it . Look at my hand .
ZED: Jesus Eric .
ERIC: Oh shit . Her clothes .
ZOEY: Tu te prends pour qui espece de connard ! ?
ERIC: La ferme ! He slams the door shut . Then he turns to Zed .
ZED: Eric , I liked that girl .
ERIC: Oh . Well , then why did n't you stop me .
ZED: Because you were on a rampage .
ERIC: Look , your whole life you 've done nothing ut fuck whores . A girl like that will give you AIDS . Why do n't you find a nice girl in the suburbs ?
ZED: Because when you need to get off you do n't want to have to date for months to do it .
ERIC: Just use your hand like me .
ZED: Sometimes you just need honestyand security .
ERIC: I do n't understand . Anyway , it 's too late . Get dressed , let 's go out and meet the boys .
ZED: Okay , let me take a shower .
ERIC: No , in Paris it 's good to smell like you 've been fucking . It will make them espect you .
ZED: Oh .
ERIC: Just put on a shirt and a sport coat . Zed starts to get dressed
ZED: Years .
ERIC: It 's amazing , you know ? Here you are . One day in America . Now here .
ZED: Well , to be honest there really was n't much happening for me in the states .
ERIC: But in Paris your old friend Eric has a job for you , so you came . That 's good .
ZED: How could I resist your invitation ?
ERIC: You would have been stupid to .
ZED: So what have you been doing here ?
ERIC: After school I spent some time in Algeria studying African philosophy . And then I ummed around . You know . For fun . Fo a while I worked at Le Figaro . The newspaper .
ZED: Really ?
ERIC: Yes . With an assumed Masters degree . And lately we have just been bombing fascists here in Paris . You know , like terrorists . Zed looks over at him .
ZED: Is that cat dead ?
ERIC: I do n't know . I think it 's asleep but it 's been there for days . Eric gives it a kick . No response .
ZED: I will .
ERIC: They all know who you are . Ne soyez pa salauds . Offrez une biere au plus grand perceur de coffres . Oliver stands up and walks to the kitchen .
OLIVER: Zed , would you like a beer ?
ZED: Thanks .
OLIVER: Do n't think of it .
CLAUDE: Come . Sit down .
ERIC: Do n't sit next to that junkie .
CLAUDE: Ahhhhhh !
ERIC: That little shit monkey of yours pissed on my Billy Holiday albums . Next time he 's out the door . Zed , come here .
OLIVER: Here you go mate .
ZED: Thanks . Oliver sits down next to Claude .
ERIC: Do n't ask me where we got this .
ZED: Okay .
ERIC: On Bastille Day , all the banks are closed . He places his hand on the blueprint .
ZED: Are you sure he wo n't push the alarm ?
ERIC: Ahhh ! He 's right next to the door . We 'd have to be totally incompetent not to stop him . Do n't worry about that . He points to the main floor vault .
ZED: What kind of vault is that ? He checks the blueprint .
ERIC: AhSwiss made . A Caliber .
ZED: Caliber ? It 'll take three hours .
ERIC: No , that 's too long .
ZED: That 's how long it 'll take .
ERIC: Well shit . It 's too long . We have to be in and out . Like that . Or there will be suspicion . A little time is okaybut too long and
ZED: Well hold on a second . What 's this ?
ERIC: Another vault .
ZED: No this . Eric looks closely at the blueprint .
ERIC: I do n't knowit connects the two vaults .
ZED: Well , what kind of vault is this othe one ?
ERIC: Also Swiss , but this one is a Poseidon .
ZED: Why would those two vaults be connected ?
ERIC: I do n't know .
ZED: Because I can get into this vault in half an hour . Maybe less .
ERIC: But this entry way is too small to get the platen out . We have a lot of merchandise in there .
ZED: No , do n't you see ? We get in through this secondary vault and take this passage to the other main vault . From the inside I could open the Caliber vault in five minutes .
ERIC: You could open it in five minutes ?
ZED: From the inside it 's easy .
ERIC: Hot damn . That is our answer .
ZED: Okay . When is Bastille day ?
ERIC: Tomorrow .
ZED: Tomorrow ! ? We 're doing this tomorrow ?
ERIC: But of course .

ZED: Years .
ERIC: It 's amazing , you know ? Here you are . One day in America . Now here .
ZED: Well , to be honest there really was n't much happening for me in the states .
ERIC: But in Paris your old friend Eric has a job for you , so you came . That 's good .
ZED: How could I resist your invitation ?
ERIC: You would have been stupid to .
ZED: So what have you been doing here ?
ERIC: After school I spent some time in Algeria studying African philosophy . And then I ummed around . You know . For fun . Fo a while I worked at Le Figaro . The newspaper .
ZED: Really ?
ERIC: Yes . With an assumed Masters degree . And lately we have just been bombing fascists here in Paris . You know , like terrorists . Zed looks over at him .
ZED: Is that cat dead ?
ERIC: I do n't know . I think it 's asleep but it 's been there for days . Eric gives it a kick . No response .
ZED: I will .
ERIC: They all know who you are . Ne soyez pa salauds . Offrez une biere au plus grand perceur de coffres . Oliver stands up and walks to the kitchen .

OLIVER: Here you go mate .
ZED: Thanks . Oliver sits down next to Claude .
ERIC: Do n't ask me where we got this .
ZED: Okay .
ERIC: On Bastille Day , all the banks are closed . He places his hand on the blueprint .
ZED: Are you sure he wo n't push the alarm ?
ERIC: Ahhh ! He 's right next to the door . We 'd have to be totally incompetent not to stop him . Do n't worry about that . He points to the main floor vault .
ZED: What kind of vault is that ? He checks the blueprint .
ERIC: AhSwiss made . A Caliber .
ZED: Caliber ? It 'll take three hours .
ERIC: No , that 's too long .
ZED: That 's how long it 'll take .
ERIC: Well shit . It 's too long . We have to be in and out . Like that . Or there will be suspicion . A little time is okaybut too long and
ZED: Well hold on a second . What 's this ?
ERIC: Another vault .
ZED: No this . Eric looks closely at the blueprint .
ERIC: I do n't knowit connects the two vaults .
ZED: Well , what kind of vault is this othe one ?
ERIC: Also Swiss , but this one is a Poseidon .
ZED: Why would those two vaults be connected ?
ERIC: I do n't know .
ZED: Because I can get into this vault in half an hour . Maybe less .
ERIC: But this entry way is too small to get the platen out . We have a lot of merchandise in there .
ZED: No , do n't you see ? We get in through this secondary vault and take this passage to the other main vault . From the inside I could open the Caliber vault in five minutes .
ERIC: You could open it in five minutes ?
ZED: From the inside it 's easy .
ERIC: Hot damn . That is our answer .
ZED: Okay . When is Bastille day ?
ERIC: Tomorrow .

ERIC: Oh , I 'm sorry . I did n't realize you were in charge now . Nobody told me . If he had opened the vault it would have saved us a fucking hour . He charges into the reserve vault area .
ZED: Eric . It 's just that we 've gone from eing thieves to murderers .
ERIC: Oh fuck it does n't matter ! Here you get the death penalty just for robbing a federal bank .
ZED: I thought the death penalty was abolished in 1980 ?
ERIC: Ohhhh ! That 's what they tell you ! But who cares ? I need to take a piss . Eric enters the bathroom .
RICARDO: Zoey looks up at them telling the joke .
ERIC: What is it ? What 's going on ? Zed gets up to go upstairs .
ZED: I do n't know .
ERIC: No ! You stay here . Eric runs upstairs .
JEAN: Claude motions to the dead security guard .
ERIC: Zoey notices Eric , she remembers him .
ERIC: Oh shit . Then Oliver yanks his off .
OLIVER: Who gives a damn if they see us or not anyway ! I ca n't see a fucking think in this ! Everyone takes their masks off .
MALE TOURIST: This is insane ! I am a U.S. citizen ! You must let me go ! Eric looks at him .
ERIC: Everyone is quiet .
CLAUDE: Eric
ERIC: Claude nods . Then , the phone rings . Everyone looks at it .
OLIVER: The phones are dead .
ERIC: She is crying too hard . Eric puts his gun to her head .
WOMAN TELLER: Banque Internationale de Paris . She pauses , then hands the phone to Eric .
ERIC: Eric motions to Oliver to check the windows . Oliver runs over and peeks out the blinds .
OLIVER: Oh my God ! The police !
ERIC: Eric looks around at the dead bodies .
ZED: What 's going on ?
ERIC: Nothing . They were just scaring them .
ZED: Well , did you tell them to stay quiet ?
ERIC: Yes . They 're assholes . Just having fun . Zed looks into the hole .
ZED: Fucked up my drill bit .
ERIC: It 's okay . You can buy another one .
ZED: Cross your fingers . Eric does . The volt meter 's needle jumps .
ERIC: Excellent . What next ?
ZED: We find the fuse box . It 'll probably be upstairs . Zed gets up .
ERIC: It 's okay . I 'll find it for you .
ZED: No . I need to see it myself .
ERIC: I think it would be better if I looked for you . I could
ZED: Hold on . Here she is . Eric is a bit relieved . Zed opens it up .
ERIC: Oh , I would n't want to do that .
ZED: Got it ?
ERIC: Got it . Zed goes back to the vaults .
ZED: Come on sweetie do n't fail me now .
ERIC: It worked ! He and Zed hug .
ZED: I can get through that lock in a minute .
ERIC: Then do it . We do n't have all day . Zed enters the Poseidon vault .
ZED: Dime store brand . Three minutes max .
ERIC: Good .
ZED: Fuck !
ERIC: Merde ! Then there 's another gunshot . The bullet ricochets through the vault .
ZED: Jesus Christ !
ERIC: Must be .
ZED: I think I stained my pants .
ERIC: Me too .
OLIVER: What is it ? ! I came down to see how things were going and heard shots !
ERIC: Some asshole in the vault . Oliver takes cover and cocks his gun .
OLIVER: We 've got guns . Why do n't we just storm in and blast his fucking ass ! It 's three against one ! Let 's give it the old
ERIC: Quiet !
OLIVER: I 'm just trying to be helpful .
ERIC: Just let me think .
OLIVER: You do n't have to snap at me . Eric peeks into the vault .
ZED: What the Hell are you doing ? Have you gone mad ?
ZED: That 's too much . It 's dangerous .
ERIC: I like danger .
ZED: You asshole ! You could have killed us all .
ERIC: But I did n't ! Let 's go check out the damage .
ZED: Go around and wait at the main vault door . When I tell you , open it up .
OLIVER: Right . When you tell me , I 'll open it up .
ZED: Right .
OLIVER: Right . Zed crawls through the opening .
ERIC: Look at it ! We 're all rich !
ZED: We 're not out of here yet .

CLAUDE: Jean surveys the mess , the crying people .
ERIC: They see the gold .

ERIC: [ Obviously , since Ricardo fucked us up and did n't kill the concierge fast enough . And killing all these assholes
CLAUDE: No .
CLAUDE: Eric pats his shoulder .
ZOEY: No ! Then , the assistant manager stops him .
ASSISTANT MANAGER: Eric suddenly calms down .
ERIC: He pushes Zoey to the ground .
ZED: Are you still there ? Nothing .
OLIVER: Sure .
ZED: Here , help me with this .
ERIC: Merde !
CLAUDE: Eric . Eric looks at him .
CLAUDE: Eric ca n't believe this .
ERIC: Then he looks at Zoey .
OLIVER: This is unbelievable . Look at all of this . It 's wonderful to touch .
ZED: Just help me steer this out . They maneuver out of the Calibre vault .
OLIVER: Do you think we should get some cash also ?
ZED: What for ?
OLIVER: Well , you never know .
ZED: Money is too easily traceable . You 'd never be able to spend it . And forget about exchanging it .
OLIVER: That 's true .
ZED: No sir . Your best bet is to get these ars melted down in Tunisia or Korea .
OLIVER: Eric knows someone in Portugal .
ZED: Or Portugal .
ZED: Do we have a covering of some kind ?
OLIVER: A what ?
ZED: You know . Something to cover this with . It 'll look kind of conspicuous leaving the bank with a platten of gold .
OLIVER: Oh , it wo n't matter . The police know what we 're up too .
ZED: Police ? ! What do you mean they know what we 're up too ?
OLIVER: You do n't know ? We 've been discovered . But Eric has them under control . Zed is frantic .

MIKE: Really ?
ANN: Yes , and what I most admire - is the way you have captured the voice of the common people .
MIKE: Well - that 's my job .
ANN: I 'm sure you 've heard this before , M Driscoll , if you do n't mind me saying - you do n't look at all like you photograph
MIKE: Excuse me ?
DENHAM: Wait a minute ! Ann -
ANN: Well , he 's so much younger - in person . And much better looking .
DENHAM: ANN ! Stop ! Stop - right there -
ANN: I was afraid you might be one of those self obsessed literary types . You know - the tweedy twerp with his nose in a ook and his head up his -
JACK: It 's nice to meet you too , Miss Darrow..
DENHAM: ait a second , we 're killing off the First Mate ?
JACK: That 's assuming she knows who the First Mate is .
DENHAM: Come on , Jack ! It was an honest mistake . Ann is near-sighted - it could happen to anyone .
JACK: I was joking , Carl .
DENHAM: The point is she 's horrified . She has to look away . And that 's when she sees it .
JACK: See 's what ? What ?
DENHAM: The island .
JACK: We 're filming on an island now ? When did this happen ?
DENHAM: Jack , keep your voice down ! I do n't want the crew getting spooked .
JACK: Why would they get spooked ? What 's it called ?
DENHAM: All right It has a local name , but I 'm warning you , Jack , it does n't sound good .
JACK: What 's wrong with this place ?
DENHAM: There 's nothing officially wrong with it . Because technically it has n't been discovered yet .
JACK: Okay alright so we arrive at
DENHAM: All right everyone , from the top . And action !
ANN: I think this is awfully exciting ! I 've never been on a ship before .
BRUCE: I 've never been on one with a woman efore .
ANN: I guess you do n't think much of women on ships , do you ?
BRUCE: No , they 're a nuisance .
DENHAM: Cut ! Great !
RUCE: hat do you think , Driscoll ? The dialogue 's got some flow now - huh ?
JACK: It was pure effluence .
BRUCE: beefed up the banter
JACK: Try to resist that impulse .
BRUCE: It 's just a little humor , Bud - what are you , a Bolshevik or something ?
JACK: Actors . They travel the world but all they ever see is a mirror !
ANN: I know , it was n't what you wrote . But Mr Baxter felt very strongly that when a man likes a woman - then he must ignore her . And if things turn really hostile no ?
JACK: Interesting theory .
ANN: I know I should have -
JACK: It was n't what I had intended but it -
ANN: I 'm sorry - I was
JACK: You made it your own
ANN: I was nervous .
JACK: It was funny , actually you were funny .
ANN: Please - do n't say another word . Good night .
ACK: Miss Darrow
DENHAM: We 're close . Head south-west .
ENGLEHORN: There 's no land south-west fo thousands of miles . It takes us way outside the shipping lanes .
DENHAM: 'll make it worth your while .
ENGLEHORN: There 's nothing out there .
DENHAM: hen you 've nothing to lose .
HAYES: If someone were to tell you this ship is headed for Singapore , what would you say ?
LUMPY: I would say they was full of it , Mr. Hayes . We turned south-west last night .
DENHAM: Gentlemen please , we 're not looking for trouble -
JIMMY: No . You 're looking for something else
DENHAM: Yes . we are . We 're gon na find Skull Island ! We 're gon na find it , film it and show it to the world . Fo twenty five cents you get to see the last blank space on the map !
LUMPY: I would n't be so sure of that .
PRESTON: What do you mean ?
LUMPY: Seven years ago , me and Mr Hayes - we were working our passage on a Norwegian barque .
HAYES: We picked up a castaway - found him in the water - he 'd been drifting fo days .
LUMPY: His ship had run aground on an island , way West of Sumatra . An island hidden in fog . He spoke of a huge wall , built so long ago - no one knew who had made it A wall a hundred foot high as strong today as it was , ages ago .
PRESTON: Why did they build the wall ?
LUMPY: The castaway - he spoke of a creature , neither beast nor man , but something monstrous , living behind that wall
DENHAM: A lion or a tiger . A man-eater . That 's how all these stories start .
PRESTON: What else did he say ?
LUMPY: Nothing . We found him the next morning he 'd stuck a knife through his heart .
DENHAM: orry fellas , you 'll have to do bette than that . Monsters belong in B movies !
HAYES: If you find this place -
ANN: You 're writing a stage comedy ?
JACK: I 'm writing it for you .
ANN: Why would you do that ?
JACK: Why would I write a play for you ?
ANN: Yes .
JACK: Is n't it obvious ?
ANN: Not to me .
JACK: Well , it 's in the sub-text .
ANN: I guess I must 've missed it .
JACK: It 's not about words

ENGLEHORN: I do n't give a damn about Carl Denham I want this ship fixed and ready to float on the next high tide . We 're leaving Mr. Hayes .
DENHAM: Can you believe this , Jack ? Skull Island ! We got our picture !
JIMMY: Why does Marlow keep going up the iver , why does n't he turn back ?
HAYES: shrugs ) There 's a part of him that wants to , Jimmy . A part , deep inside himself that sounds a warning , but there 's another part , that needs to know that needs to defeat the thing which makes him afraid .
JIMMY: It 's not an adventure story - is it , Mr. Hayes .
HAYES: No , Jimmy , it 's not .
PRESTON: It 's deserted
DENHAM: Of course it 's deserted . Use you eyes , Preston . The place is a ruin ! Nobody 's lived here for hundreds of years .

PUPKIN: Well , that night you did Paar , I walked out of the theater like I was in a dream . All of a sudden , I knew what I wanted . I started catching your guest appearances on Sullivan and taping them and , when you got your own show , it got to be a kind of egular thing . I studied how you built to your one-liners , nice and relaxed like you were chatting , and how you delivered
LANGFORD: Look er what was the name ?
PUPKIN: I 'm Rupert , Jerry .
LANGFORD: Look , Rupert . I know what you 're saying . But things do n't work that way . You ca n't just walk onto a network show without any experience . You 've got to start at the ottom
PUPKIN: But that 's where I am !
LANGFORD: You 've got to work your way up , learn you trade in front of live audiences , start playing the little clubs .
PUPKIN: But that can take years , Jerry ! Look at me . I 'm already 31 years old ! People my age are way ahead of me . I 've got some catching up to do and I need your help . What do you say , Jerry ? All I 'm asking you to do is listen to my act . That 's all . Is that asking too much ?
LANGFORD: I get calls from agents every day . All they want
PUPKIN: I tried getting an agent . I did , Jerry .
LANGFORD: Look , why do n't you call my office .
PUPKIN: Could I ? ! ? Oh , I knew you 'd say that , Jerry . You do n't know how many times I 've had this conversation in my head . And this is the way it always turns out . That 's why I had to sort of invite myself into the ca tonight . I know it 's kind of presumptuous and I really appreciate the time you 've given me . But breaks like this do n't just happen . You have to make your own breaks .
LANGFORD: Nice meeting you , Rupert . I hope it all works out for you .
PUPKIN: Thanks , Jerry . I do n't know how to repay you . I 'm a little short on cash this evening , but , if you do n't mind some good , hearty food , I 'd be honored to take you to dinner .
LANGFORD: Thanks , but some people are waiting for me .
PUPKIN: Oh , I understand . Well , then , maybe I could epay you with a joke .
LANGFORD: Not bad . Maybe .
PUPKIN: Consider it a gift . Hey , Jerry ! How about lunch ? My treat !
LANGFORD: Call my office .
PUPKIN: Thanks , Jerry .
VINCENT: I 'm sorry , Mr. Langford . How did you get in ?
LANGFORD: That 's alright , Vincent . Mr. Pupkin 's a friend of mine .
VINCENT: Oh , I see .
PUPKIN: That 's alright . Now if you 'd be good enough to find us a nice table .
VINCENT: Certainly . This way , please .
LANGFORD: Is Eddie here today , Vincent ?
VINCENT: I 'll send him over . A WAITER arrives and hands them the menu .
WAITER: Our specialty today is Rizzofino Dolce Acqua a la Marinara con Spezi . Very good .
PUPKIN: Sounds like a new opera .
LANGFORD: Fine . What comes with it ?
WAITER: Me . The three laugh .
PUPKIN: Fine . For two .
WAITER: Very good . The WAITER leaves .
PUPKIN: You look tired , Jerry .
LANGFORD: It shows , does it ? It 's all these problems with the show . That and the custody suit .
PUPKIN: I was sorry to read about that , Jerry . Charlene never should have gotten the kids . If there 's anything I can do .
LANGFORD: I appreciate it , Rube . Just talking about it a little with you helps .
PUPKIN: Has n't Eddie already done you ?
LANGFORD: Never mind . You were saying
PUPKIN: Well , I 've been giving a lot of thought to your situation , Jerry , ever since I saw you starting to lose ground in the atings . And I think I know what the problem is . Too many of the same faces .
LANGFORD: Yeah ?
PUPKIN: Sure , people are getting tired of these people who live off game shows and talk
LANGFORD: You know , maybe you 're right , Rube .
PUPKIN: I 'm sure I am . When a show runs out of surprises , it loses its audience .
GIRL: Dolores .
PUPKIN: To Dolores , who sensed greatness . Rupert Pupkin .
GIRL: Thanks , Mr. Pupkin . The GIRL leaves .
PUPKIN: You see what I mean ? What you need on the show is some unknown quantity , some brilliant talent making his television debut . Imagine the suspense . Who is this young guy ? How will he do with the eyes of all America on him ? Something like that has got to help .
LANGFORD: And that 's where you come in .
PUPKIN: Why not ? Believe me , Jerry , I 'd give you the credit you deserve and I 'll stick with you . Anytime you need me , I 'll be there , doing a few minutes at Guild scale .
LANGFORD: I 'd be grateful , Rube . I really would .
EDDIE: All finished , Mr. Langford .
PUPKIN: Oh , Jerry , you sneaky
LANGFORD: Looks good , Eddie .
PUPKIN: What 's this ?
WAITER: Compliments of Mr. Sardi .
PUPKIN'S VOICE: How does your afternoon look ?
LANGFORD'S VOICE: What have you got in mind ?
PUPKIN'S VOICE: Well , we 've still got time to catch the Cubs and the Mets out at Shea .
LANGFORD'S VOICE: Why not ? But first , a toast . To you , Rube and your success .
PUPKIN'S VOICE: Thanks , Jerry .
PUPKIN: Thanks , Jerry .
LANGFORD: Say hello to Jerry .
GIRL'S VOICE: It 's Marsha , Jerry . Did you get my note ? I left it on the back seat . Did you get it ? I dropped it there before they pulled me out . Those guys hurt me , Jerry . Jerry ?
LANGFORD: Who gave you this number ?
MARSHA'S VOICE: Do n't be angry with me , Jerry . I did n't know what else to do ; I 've been trying you every five minutes , I miss you , aby Jerry ?
PUPKIN: Miss ! RITA comes over . PUPKIN smiles knowingly .
RITA: Heineken 's alright ?
PUPKIN: Fine .
RITA: You 're not Rupert Pupkin ! PUPKIN smiles broadly .
PUPKIN: Sally Gardner , I met her after a matinee . Are n't you glad to see me ?
RITA: Sure , sure . How is old Sally ?
PUPKIN: The same , I guess . You know , two kids , a nice husband , living in Clifton .
RITA: It figures .
PUPKIN: A lot of the kids in our class have moved back .
RITA: What are you doing here ?
PUPKIN: I just thought I 'd say hello . Here , I brought you a little something .
RITA: Oh , yeah , Mr . Romance .
PUPKIN: Do n't forget to put in an aspirin . It lasts longer .
RITA: Nothing 's gon na keep it alive in this place .
PUPKIN: How have you been , dear , sweet Rita ?
RITA: I do n't have an aspirin .
PUPKIN: Maybe a Rolaids would work .
RITA: Well , what are you up to these days , Rupert ?
PUPKIN: Did n't you know you 'd see me again ?
RITA: You still going to the movies ?
PUPKIN: You 're looking as beautiful as ever .
RITA: Oh , yeah . I was a real knockout .
PUPKIN: I thought so .
RITA: Well , here I am . Local cheerleade makes good .
PUPKIN: I voted for you for Most Beautiful .
RITA: Yeah ?
PUPKIN: I did n't have the nerve to tell you then , ut I guess it 's alright now .
RITA: Well , nothing terrible 's gon na happen , if that 's what you mean .
PUPKIN: Great ! Everything 's starting to break .
RITA: Is that right ?
PUPKIN: Yeah . As a matter of fact , that 's why I 'm here . I 've known about this place for a long time . I just did n't want to make my move until I had something to offer you . Everything 's a question of timing .
RITA: Jesus Christ , Rupert Pupkin !
RITA: Why , you got something better ?
PUPKIN: Maybe .
RITA: What ?
PUPKIN: What are you doing tonight ?
RITA: Tonight ? RITA starts laughing .
PUPKIN: What 's so funny ?
RITA: You call me up all junior and senior year . Night after night after night , right ? And every time I 'm wondering 'when is this guy going to stop talking and ask me out ? ' Well , now I know the answer . August twelfth , nineteen seventy-six . It only
PUPKIN: If I had asked you out ? Would you have gone ?
RITA: Oh , no .
PUPKIN: Why not ? RITA starts laughing again .
RITA: Because I thought you were a jerk !
PUPKIN: You see ! I was right ! But that guy is n't me anymore . I look at my picture in the yearbook and I do n't even recognize myself . I 'm not the same guy , Rita .
MAN: Rita !
RITA: Excuse me a minute , honey .
PUPKIN: I 'm not honey ! I 'm Rupert .
RITA: And then ?
PUPKIN: Well , tomorrow night I thought we 'd go out again , talk some more , get to know each other even better .
RITA: How much ?
PUPKIN: How much what ?
RITA: How much do we have to get to know each other ?
PUPKIN: I do n't understand .
RITA: How much do we have to get to know each other before we start talking about that job ?
PUPKIN: I 'm not talking about any job .
RITA: Then what 's this big offer you were talking about ?
PUPKIN: You 'll see . Right now I 'm asking you for a date . How about it ?
RITA: I 'm sorry , Rupert . But I 'm busy .
PUPKIN: Busy ?
RITA: Yeah . Busy .
PUPKIN: But this is the biggest night of my life .
RITA: I 've already got a date .
MAN: Rita !
PUPKIN: Miss ! Miss ! RITA returns to him .
RITA: None of your business .
RITA: He 's a good friend of mine .
PUPKIN: Tell him you 're busy .
RITA: What 's so important about tonight ?
PUPKIN: Everything ! You do n't understand .
RITA: No . I do n't . It 's been really nice seeing you , Rupert . Thanks for dropping in . But I 've got some work to do .
PUPKIN: Miss ! RITA walks over reluctantly .
RITA: I have work to do , Rupert .
PUPKIN: Just listen . I 'm at the start of something really big . I do n't want to talk about it here but it 's going to happen soon and it 's going to be great for both of us .
RITA: No kidding ?
PUPKIN: So see that guy some other night .

PUPKIN: But I have n't finished !
RITA: I 'll get you another one .
PUPKIN: Miss ! Miss !
MAN: C'mon , schmuck , wake up so I can kick your ass outta here .
RITA: He was making trouble one minute and the next he was on the floor .
COOK: Okay , buddy , here we go .
RITA: Okay , Tarzan . Where do we eat tonight ?
PUPKIN: Chopsticks , please . The WAITER nods and leaves .
RITA: So all this time you 've been thinking about me , huh ?
PUPKIN: That 's right , Rita .
RITA: What kinds of things were you thinking ?
RITA: Rupert Pupkin is an unclean person !
PUPKIN: Come on , Rita . People will hear .
RITA: Rupert Pupkin is an unclean person . Oh , come on , Rupert . Relax . Have a little fun .
PUPKIN: This is a very important evening to me , Rita .
RITA: Did you know your nose wiggled when you talked ?
PUPKIN: It does ?
RITA: Yeah . Just the tip . Like a rabbit . Hey , are we gon na eat o what ? I 'm starving . PUPKIN serves RITA .
PUPKIN: Just taste . RITA tastes .
RITA: Well , I guess it wo n't kill me .
PUPKIN: This is supposed to be the finest Cantonese cuisine in the city .
RITA: Yeah ? Then what happened to the tablecloths ? PUPKIN drops his eyes .
PUPKIN: I used to see you at the Garden every year .
RITA: Oh , the Follies . That was the right name for 'em . How did you know which one was me ? We all looked like chickens . What I mean is , we all looked like the u > same chicken . I thought it was gon na be Rita Keane in the Ice Follies and I wind up looking like Henny Penny . RITA chuckles to herself .
PUPKIN: You just did n't get the breaks .
RITA: Breaks , bullshit ! My parents did n't have the money for the right coach . But what difference does it make ? She starts laughing to herself .
PUPKIN: I liked the show .
RITA: Yeah ? The Follies ? You really must have been carrying the torch . What did you think when I got married ? You knew I got married ?
PUPKIN: I knew it would n't last .
RITA: You think I should have married you , instead , huh ?
PUPKIN: Peter Drysdale ! Really , Rita !

RITA: You mean am I `` going steady '' ? Rupert , I 'm thirty-one years old !
PUPKIN: What about that guy tonight ?
RITA: Him ?
PUPKIN: Why him ?
RITA: What am I supposed to do , huh ? Sit home watching TV ? He 's just some guy . He 's got his own aluminum siding usiness . He comes into the city sometimes , that 's all .
PUPKIN: You do n't go out with him for his money ? ! ?
RITA: Oh , horrors ! Look , Rupert , what do you think they pay me in that dump ? Ninety-five bucks . And you do n't get the world 's greatest tippers in there either . Somebody has to take care of me .
PUPKIN: That 's what I want to talk to you about , Rita . The WAITER arrives with RITA 's drink .
RITA: You are , Rupert . Especially your nose .
PUPKIN: Just tell me .
RITA: Is this some kind of game ? Are you going to tell me something about my character ?
PUPKIN: You 'll see . Give me his name .

RITA: Redford !
PUPKIN: That 's Robert Redford .
RITA: It is ?
PUPKIN: No ! It 's it 's Rupert Pupkin
RITA: Your act ?
PUPKIN: Get that guy you knew from Clifton out of your head right now . You 're looking at Rupert Pupkin , Rita . Rupert Pupkin , the new King of Comedy .
RITA: I 'm sorry .
PUPKIN: Why not me , Rita ? A guy can always get what he wants if he 's willing to pay the price . All it takes is a little talent and sacrifice and the ight break . If you 've got a friend in the right place , that 's all it takes . And that 's exactly what I have going for me right now . Afte all , crazier things have happened .
RITA: It sounds wonderful , Rupert , and I eally hope you get what you want . But it 's getting late and I 'm a working girl . You know what I mean ?
PUPKIN: You going to spend the rest of you life in that place ? Is that what you eally want , talking about nothing with nothings ? I thought you wanted something a little better than that and that 's what I 'm offering . Every King needs a Queen , Rita . I want you to be mine . What do you say ?
RITA: You really want to help me out ? You see this . A hundred seventy-five ucks . If you could spare fifty , say , until next Monday , that would keep three people really happy me , my landlord and my dentist .
WAITER: Telephone for you , Miss .
RITA: Me ? Nobody knows I 'm here . You did n't tell anybody , did you ?
PUPKIN: No .
RITA: What the hell 's going on ?
MAN'S VOICE: Hi .
RITA: Who is this ?
MAN'S VOICE: Who do you think it is ? I 've been staring at you all evening .
RITA: Where are you ?
PUPKIN: How did they know you were here ?
RITA: I guess I must have told them . They need someone right away .
PUPKIN: You do n't even care , do you ?
RITA: Oh , no . I do . Really !
PUPKIN: It 's not the bar , Rita . Do n't tell me it 's the bar .
PUPKIN: Why do n't we finish the evening up at the bar together ? End the evening where it began ?
RITA: After what happened there ?
PUPKIN: Well , I could at least drop you off !
RITA: That 's okay . Really . I can manage . Why do n't you just go to a movie o something ? Do n't let me spoil you evening .
PUPKIN: But that would n't be right . RITA gets up and stands before PUPKIN .
RITA: Look , Rupert . It 's been a lot of fun , eally . I 'll see you sometime , huh ?
PUPKIN: But Rita ! RITA starts moving towards the door .
RITA: Come on , Rupert . I 'm in a hurry .
YOUNG MAN: Welcome to the pleasure dome .

YOUNG MAN: You from the South ?
RITA: Me ?
YOUNG MAN: That 's what Southern people drink . Lots of bourbon .
RITA: What do people from Jersey drink ?
YOUNG MAN: I make it a point to study things like that . It 's important to know people 's backgrounds , their tastes , their culture . It gives you a little head start .
RITA: I 'm Mary .
YOUNG MAN: Pleased to meat you , Mary . To our evening .
WOMAN'S VOICE: Who ?
PUPKIN: Rita Keane . I want to talk to her .
WOMAN'S VOICE: Rita Keane ?
PUPKIN: That 's right . Oh , never mind . I must have the wrong apartment .
WOMAN'S VOICE: There 's no Rita here .
PUPKIN: I know . I know . I 'm sorry to bothe you .
WOMAN'S VOICE: You must have the wrong apartment .
YOUNG MAN: Leisure is America 's fastest growing industry . Did you know that ? Think about it . Short work weeks , more vacation . People need something to do with all that time and that 's where I come in . Leisure Villages , Inc. We buy land an hour or so outside your metropolitan centers . We set up the bungalows , dig some lakes , lay out a golf course , you know , fix the whole place up so it 's usable . Then young , personable guys like me show the people around . It the guy seems tight , we point out the investment factor . If he 's a swinger , well , the bungalows are very private . If he 's a sports nut , we talk up skiing and fishing and tennis . The phonograph starts playing Burt Bachrach .
RITA: Me . I fly for National .
YOUNG MAN: No kidding ?
RITA: What 's that smell ?
YOUNG MAN: Sandalwood incense . It seemed very you .
PUPKIN: I said I 'm sorry !

YOUNG MAN: Why do n't we make our own movie ?
RITA: No . I do n't think so .
YOUNG MAN: Do n't be so uptight . Give it a chance .
RITA: I want to go to the movies , that 's all .
YOUNG MAN: We can go to the movies later . RITA pulls her hands away .
RITA: Let 's stop playing games , okay . I 'm not a kid .
YOUNG MAN: You have something against pleasure ?
YOUNG MAN: Shall I freshen up your drink ? RITA shakes her head .
MAN'S VOICE: Yeah ?
YOUNG MAN: Look , if you 've got sexual problems let 's talk about them . It helps clear the air .
RITA: There 's nothing wrong with me .
YOUNG MAN: Then it 's me ?
RITA: I do n't even know you .
YOUNG MAN: Then find out . Sex is a great way of breaking down barriers .
RITA: I do n't think so .
YOUNG MAN: I 'm sure this could lead to something eautiful . The YOUNG MAN kisses RITA roughly .
RITA: Let 's just write this thing off as a big mistake . What do you say ?
YOUNG MAN: What 's wrong with me ?
RITA: Nothing . I just want to go home .
YOUNG MAN: I can see I 'm not turning you on .
RITA: You noticed that , huh ?
YOUNG MAN: Come on . What 's wrong with me ?
RITA: You really want to know ?
YOUNG MAN: Yeah .
RITA: How can I put it ? Well , it 's like you 've got your fly open and you tongue hanging out .
YOUNG MAN: I 'm really a very sensitive person .
RITA: Come on . Get offa me .
YOUNG MAN: Sometimes I write poetry . RITA pulls herself away .
RITA: No !
YOUNG MAN: So you wan na play hard to get , huh ? The YOUNG MAN grabs her .
RITA: Come on . Let 's talk this over .
YOUNG MAN: I admire you very much . I respect you , Mary .
RITA: You 're hurting me .
YOUNG MAN: I 'm only doing what you want .
RITA: Oh , please .
YOUNG MAN: Afterwards , you 'll thank me .
PUPKIN: Rita !
RITA: What do you want ?
PUPKIN: Do n't be angry with me . I was worried about you , that 's all .
RITA: Just go home and leave me alone .
PUPKIN: Here . You 'll need this . It 's getting chilly .
RITA: I 'm so bad . I 'm such a dummy .
PUPKIN: Do n't say that , Rita . Everyone does crazy things .
RITA: Not all the time .
PUPKIN: I 'll get us a cab .
RITA: Well , I guess you 're entitled to come up for coffee .
PUPKIN: That 's okay , Rita . You 're tired and I know I 'm not always the easiest guy to be with . There is a pause .
RITA: What do you want , Rupert ?
PUPKIN: You do n't understand anything , do you ? I love you , Rita . I want to change your life if you 'll only give me a chance . RITA just shakes her head sadly .
RITA: There 's no
PUPKIN: I 'll arrange that , Rita . We 'll all go out to dinner some night or maybe out to his place , on a weekend . You 'll see . The trouble with you is you 've got no faith . Now go to bed and get a good rest and I 'll see you in a couple of days .

'' So I bent over and told him `` I 'm gon na take 'em ack to Florida and set 'em free ! '' LANGFORD and the AUDIENCE laugh heartily .
RECEPTIONIST: I 'm sorry , Mr. Pupkin , but Mr. Langford 's secretary has no record of any appointment .
PUPKIN: Pardon me ?
RECEPTIONIST: Mr. Langford 's secretary has no ecord of any appointment .
PUPKIN: Well , technically speaking , I do n't actually have an appointment . Jerry asked me to call him today and when I could n't get through , I thought
RECEPTIONIST: I see . He says Mr. Langford asked him to call . Mr. Langford 's secretary wants to know what this is in reference to .

PUPKIN: More or less . It 's hard to describe how its happens .
LANGFORD: But that 's just it , Rube . It does n't happen for me . Why do you think the show is in so much trouble ? By the time I 've done my monologue , everyone has switched to Carson . Maybe if you did a little writing ?
PUPKIN: Sure , Jerry , I 'd do anything I could to help out .
LANGFORD: You would ? Great . Why do n't you come out to my place this weekend and we 'll hash it out . I 'm having a few of my friends but we should be able to get a little work in .
PUPKIN: Would you mind if I brought someone ?
LANGFORD: A girl , Rube ?
PUPKIN: A very special girl , Jerry .
LANGFORD: I 'd love to meet her .
DOORMAN: Cab , Jerry ?
LANGFORD: That 's alright , thanks .
DRIVER: Hey , Jerry . My brother can sing and juggle at the same time . How about puttin ' him on your show ? LANGFORD keeps walking .
LANGFORD: Sorry , I 'm off duty .
WOMAN: You 're Jerry ! !
LARRY: I ca n't get anything started with he until you 're off the air . Your show is ruining my sex life , Jerry .
LANGFORD: Well then , you 'll just have to put on a better show than I do .
MARSHA: Jerry ! God damnit !
RECEPTIONIST: Yes , sir ? Oh , hi .
PUPKIN: Hi . How are you ?
RECEPTIONIST: Not bad .
PUPKIN: I 'm fine .
RECEPTIONIST: Can I help you ?
PUPKIN: I 'd like to see Jerry , please .
RECEPTIONIST: You are ?
PUPKIN: Mr. Pupkin .
RECEPTIONIST: Just a minute .
PUPKIN: Who ?
RECEPTIONIST: Miss Long .
PUPKIN: But I wanted to see Jerry .
RECEPTIONIST: Mr. Langford 's not in . Miss Long will take care of you .
PUPKIN: Alright .
CATHY LONG: Mr. Pupkin ?
PUPKIN: How are you today ?
CATHY LONG: Fine , Mr. Pupkin . Thank you fo your tape . We listened to it with great interest . And , frankly , Mr. Pupkin , we saw a lot of good things in what you 're doing . We feel you have good potential . Very good potential .
PUPKIN: Thanks .
CATHY LONG: That 's why I 'll be honest with you , Mr. Pupkin
PUPKIN: Yes ?
CATHY LONG: We just do n't think you 're ready yet .
PUPKIN: Not ready ?
CATHY LONG: Well , we just do n't feel right now that you 're right for Jerry .
PUPKIN: Right for Jerry . Sure .
CATHY LONG: Some of the material some of the one-liners , for instance
PUPKIN: Yes ?
CATHY LONG: were not very strong .
PUPKIN: You did n't care for some of the jokes , is that it ?
CATHY LONG: That '' s right .
PUPKIN: Good . Good . I can take care of that right way . Thanks . Just tell me the ones you think should go . That would be a big help . This is great . Which ones ?
CATHY LONG: Well , it 's not just that , Mr. Pupkin . You see , Jerry likes to panel his guests , you know , chat with them afterwards .
PUPKIN: Sure . Sure .
CATHY LONG: And frankly , we just do n't feel you 've got very much to talk about right now .
PUPKIN: But I 've got my whole life to talk about !
CATHY LONG: Which is interesting to you , I 'm sure and to your wife and to a few friends . But we feel that you should keep developing your act . Test it in some live situations . There are a number of clubs in the city you can
PUPKIN: May I ask you a question , Miss Long ?
CATHY LONG: Of course .
PUPKIN: Are you speaking for Jerry ?
CATHY LONG: Let 's put it this way , Mr. Pupkin . Mr. Langford has complete faith in our judgment .
PUPKIN: I 'm sorry to have to say this , Miss Long , and I certainly do n't want you to take it personally , but I have to
CATHY LONG: Well , I 'm sorry you feel that way , Mr. Pupkin . But I 'm afraid there 's nothing that can be done about that .
PUPKIN: No No I 'm afraid I 'll have to disagree with you again .
CATHY LONG: That 's your privilege , Mr. Pupkin . Now , if you 'll excuse me , please , I have some things to do . I 'm sorry the news is n't better . CATHY LONG turns to go .
PUPKIN: Miss Long ? CATHY LONG turns back .
CATHY LONG: He wo n't be in until very late this afternoon .
PUPKIN: That 's fine . Thank you .
RECEPTIONIST: Is there anyone else you would like to see ?
PUPKIN: That 's alright . I 'm happy just waiting . A few beats pass in silence .
RECEPTIONIST: Well , would you mind waiting outside , please , Mr. Pupkin ? This is a reception area , not a waiting room .
PUPKIN: I understand .
OFFICIAL: Mr. Pupkin ? I 'm Raymond Wirtz , in charge of security for the Langford organization .
WIRTZ: Now I think you understand that we have certain rules here that are essential to the smooth functioning of our operation .
PUPKIN: Sure . Sure .
WIRTZ: And that without these rules , we really would n't be able to function at ou est . You follow my point ? PUPKIN nods .
PUPKIN: You want me to leave the building .
WIRTZ: That 's right . It 's nothing personal , Mr. Pupkin . Just doing my job .
MARSHA: Well , did you give it to him ?
PUPKIN: Huh ?
MARSHA: Did you get my letter to him ?
PUPKIN: He 's not in there .
MARSHA: Look , if you do n't want to give it him , okay . I 'll get somebody else . But do n't try to con me .
PUPKIN: I told you I 'd try and I will . I 'm going to wait for him right here .
MARSHA: Give me the envelope , huh ?
PUPKIN: Sure , but
MARSHA: I saw him go in myself !
PUPKIN: Who ?
MARSHA: Jerry !
PUPKIN: But they said he was n't in .
MARSHA: Just give me the envelope .
PUPKIN: When did he go in ?
MARSHA: Ten minutes ago ! That 's when .
PUPKIN: You sure ?
MARSHA: Look , I saw him my
PUPKIN: And he has n't come out ?
MARSHA: I 've been standing right here . Now how about it ?
PUPKIN: Tell Jerry Langford I 'm here , please .
RECEPTIONIST: I 'm sorry , sir . Mr. Langford 's not in .
RECEPTIONIST: I 'm sorry . He 's not in .
PUPKIN: You 're putting your job on the line , lady .
WIRTZ: You had your warning , Mr. Krupkin .
PUPKIN: Jerry ! Help me . Jerry !
WIRTZ: If we see your face again , Mr. Pupkin , we 'll call the police .
PUPKIN: Start looking for a new job !
MARSHA: Well ?
PUPKIN: Huh ?
MARSHA: Does he have it ?
PUPKIN: Do n't worry . I 'll get it to him .
MARSHA: Yeah ? When ? There is a pause .
PUPKIN: This weekend . He asked me to go out there , to his house .
RITA: What are we going to do ?
PUPKIN: Look , I told you , I 've got some work to discuss with him . That 's all .
RITA: But what about me ?
PUPKIN: You 're with me .
RITA: That 's fine , but while you two are talking , what am I going to do ?
PUPKIN: You can chat with the other guests .
RITA: I 'm sure they 'll be thrilled hearing about the wonderful world of draft beer . Let 's tell 'em I 'm a model , okay ?
PUPKIN: What ?
RITA: If they ask what I do , let 's just say I model . You do n't mind pretending just a little , do you ?
PUPKIN: If it make you feel better . There is a pause .
RITA: This is a gas ! Too bad nobody 'll elieve it . After you guys are done working , what happens ? Are we going out someplace , or what ?
PUPKIN: I 'm sure Jerry has something arranged .
RITA: What do these people do for fun ? Do they party or do freaky things or just get drunk or I mean , What do they do ?
PUPKIN: I guess they just sit around and talk and enjoy each other 's company , like anybody else .
RITA: Talk ? ! ? What can you talk about for three or four hours ? !
PUPKIN: What do you mean ? They 've got plenty
RITA: Yeah , a cocktail party with no drinks . That 's what all those shows are . At least they help you get to sleep . There is a pause .
PUPKIN: Just take it easy , Rita . Everything 's going to be fine .
ONE GUEST: Looks like you 've found yourself a winner , Jerry .
LANGFORD: He 's the one who found himself a winner .
PUPKIN: Oh , yes .
OFFICIAL: We are met here in these extraordinary circumstances to join this man and this woman in holy wedlock . But , before we egin , let me voice a personal word of thanks to you , Rupert and to you , Rita , for choosing me to perform this prestigious ceremony . Because we are on prime time , I am going to discard my customary remarks in favor of a few personal reflections . When I was principal at Clifton High and these two were students , I had very little faith that Rupert here would amount to very much . But like his teachers and his fellow students , I underestimated this fine young man . Some say that this misjudgment is directly tied to my ecent dismissal as head of the Clifton School System . But let me take this opportunity to set the record straight . Knowing that Rupert and Rita here were
CONDUCTOR'S VOICE: Greenwich . Greenwich next stop . Greenwich .
RITA: Look at that one . How 'd you like to live in that ? ! ? ! Or that one ! What do you figure these run ?
PUPKIN: What 's this ?
DRIVER: This is it .
RITA: It 's gorgeous ! PUPKIN is genuinely puzzled .
PUPKIN: You sure ?
DRIVER: Look , friend , I would n't want to tell you how many times I made this trip . That 'll be three seventy-five .
PUPKIN: Keep it .
DRIVER: Thanks . If you need a ride back , just ask the guy for Wayne . That 's me .
PUPKIN: You must be Jonno . I 'm Rupert Pupkin and this is Rita Keane . Mr. Langford 's expecting us . Jonno nods politely but uncertainly .
JONNO: Mr. Langford asked you to come ?
PUPKIN: That 's right . Would you mind taking those up ? Jerry and I have some work that may oblige me to stay overnight .
JONNO: But Mr. Langford 's not here .
PUPKIN: Out playing golf , right ?
JONNO: That 's right .
PUPKIN: Maybe he 'll finally break a hundred .
JONNO: Maybe it 's better if you came back
PUPKIN: That 's alright . We do n't mind waiting .
RITA: The table 's only set for one .
PUPKIN: That 's from breakfast . Relax , will you ?
JONNO: Let me talk to Jerry Langford please I know he is It 's important .
PUPKIN: How do you like it ?
RITA: I could live here .
PUPKIN: It 's the only way to live .
RITA: How come he is n't here ?
PUPKIN: You heard the guy . He 's out playing golf .
RITA: Did n't you tell him when we 'd get here ?
PUPKIN: We did n't have time to iron out the details . Now just relax . We 're the first guests , that 's all .
RITA: That Jonno character had n't even heard of us !
PUPKIN: It probably slipped Jerry 's mind . He has better things to think about than what he tells his houseboy .
RITA: It 's just not time way I expected it , that 's all .
PUPKIN: These are Jerry 's parents . His fathe uns the Post office in Wolverine that 's in North Dakota .
RITA: Sure I can .
PUPKIN: That was the name of the show .
RITA: Look at this . I love these kind of things . Look at the work . I 've got this thing about boxes .
JONNO: Mr. Langford ? I 'm sorry to disturb you
RITA: How much longer are we gon na have to wait ?
PUPKIN: I do n't know . Until he gets back .
RITA: Does n't he have any music or anything ? Let 's get a little life into this place . It 's like a funeral parlor .
PUPKIN: Come on , Rita .
RITA: Come on , yourself .
RITA: Come on , Rupert . I came up here fo a good time .
SINATRA'S VOICE: The way you wore your hat , The way we danced till three , The memory of all that Oh no , they ca n't take that away from me , No they ca n't take that away from me . The orchestra plays .
RITA: You never could dance , could you ?
PUPKIN: How would you know ?
RITA: Oh I danced with you a couple of times at the Sigma U party .
PUPKIN: You were there with Tommy Winston .
RITA: You did n't ask me .
PUPKIN: That 's the one time I did ask you and you went with him anyway .
RITA: Well , I could n't go with you !
PUPKIN: Why not ?
RITA: Be serious , Rupert .
PUPKIN: Well , it 's all ended happily and that 's what counts .
RITA: I wonder what the rest of this place looks like ?
PUPKIN: I 'm sure it 's all very nice .
RITA: Well , there 's only one way to find out .
PUPKIN: Rita ! CAMERA FOLLOWS PUPKIN up the stairs .
RITA: I love it ! All those millions of women out there dying to change places with me right now .
PUPKIN: Come on . We should n't be here .
RITA: Relax , will you . Let me have a little fun , for Christ 's sake . RITA gets off the bed and runs into the john .
PUPKIN: Let 's go , Rita .
RITA: Boy , I really need some sun .
PUPKIN: Rita , this is Jerry 's
RITA: Lay off , will you , Rupert .
PUPKIN: But we have no right
RITA: Here . She looks around .
LANGFORD: Where are they ?
JONNO: I was going to call the police but then I thought to myself 'what if they are Mr. Langford 's friends ? '
PUPKIN: Hi , Jerry . We were just freshening up .
RITA: Pleased to meet you .
PUPKIN: What 's your pleasure ?
LANGFORD: What 's going on here ?
PUPKIN: We 've been sitting around , waiting . That 's all . How was your golf game ?
JONNO: I told them you were n't here .
COOK: That 's right .
PUPKIN: He did , Jerry . He was very helpful . We had to take an early train . There was nothing else until after one . I brought the material . It 's upstairs , in my bags . Where is everybody ?
LANGFORD: Who ?
PUPKIN: The other guests ! We 're getting a little hungry , to tell you the truth .
LANGFORD: You are .
PUPKIN: But we do n't mind waiting , do we , Rita ?
LANGFORD: You know , I could have you arrested , oth of you .
PUPKIN: You know you could ! And there 'd be absolutely no way we could prove we elonged here . I never thought of that .
LANGFORD: Well , you should have before you
PUPKIN: Maybe we could work up a routine about that , about a guy who throws all his friends in jail . Let 's talk about that .
LANGFORD: Let 's not .
PUPKIN: Sure , Jerry . Whatever you
LANGFORD: Look , if you 've got something fo me to sign , let 's have it and get it over with so I can get back
PUPKIN: That would n't be right , Jerry . Not in your own house !
LANGFORD: I have a lot of work to get to . How did they get here ?
PUPKIN: We took a taxi , Jerry But do n't worry about us . You go ahead and do your work and we 'll just take a stroll around until lunch is ready .
LANGFORD: You 're a little thick , are n't you ?
PUPKIN: Well , maybe a
RITA: What 's he 's saying , Rupert , is that he wants us out .
PUPKIN: Do n't listen to her , Jerry . She does n't understand anything about us .
RITA: Do n't get me into this .
LANGFORD: Call the station .
PUPKIN: Look , Jerry , if I 've said anything out of line , let 's chalk it up to inexperience , okay ? I 'll just go upstairs and get my tape and we can start working . It should n't take long and then you 'll have the rest of the afternoon to yourself .
LANGFORD: I 've told you just as clearly as I can . I want you out of here and I want you out now . Scram , beat it , vamoose , out ! Is that plain enough ! RITA deftly pockets the enamel box .
PUPKIN: But what about my material ? When are we going to go over it ?
RITA: Come on , Rupert , the man wants us to go .
PUPKIN: Tell her she 's wrong , Jerry !
RITA: Look , Mr. Langford . I did n't know anything about all this . I hardly know this guy . I have n't seen him in years .
PUPKIN: Rita !
RITA: So if there 's anything I can do , any way I can make this up to you .
PUPKIN: She 's nothing , Jerry . She 's just some girl who works in a bar . Do n't let her spoil things .
LANGFORD: Come on . Let 's go .
PUPKIN: All I 'm asking is fifteen minutes . That 's all . Just long enough to listen to my act . Is that asking too much fifteen minutes of you day against my whole life ?
LANGFORD: I 'll call the police if I have to .
PUPKIN: But what about me , Jerry ? What about u > my life ? I made plans based on what you said . You ca n't just turn your back on me .
LANGFORD: I 'm not telling you again .
PUPKIN: So this is the way it works when you 're big , huh ? You just play with people . Is that part of the kick , Jerry ? I can see I was all wrong about you . All wrong . RITA starts tugging at PUPKIN .
RITA: Come on , Rupert .
PUPKIN: Shut up ! You were n't my friend at all , were you ? You were just playing some kind of game with me . Well , that 's not going to stop me , Jerry . I 'm just going to work a little bit harder , that 's all , use a little bit more enterprise . And not count on anybody . That 's where I made my mistake . I can see that now . PUPKIN picks up the pair of small suitcases .
RITA: What did you think was going to happen ? You think he 'd just ? What 's the matter with you ? You ca n't just walk into a guy 's house ! And what about me ? What did you
PUPKIN: Shut up , Rita . I 'm thinking .
MARSHA: How much longer ? ! ?
PUPKIN: Do you want him or not ? There is a pause .
MARSHA: You sure he 's in there ?
PUPKIN: Certain .
MARSHA: My parents are going to be furious !
PUPKIN: That 's the whole point . Pay attention .
MARSHA: What if he does n't come down ?
PUPKIN: He will .
MARSHA: But what if he does n't ?
PUPKIN: We 'll come back tomorrow .
MARSHA: And wait again ?
PUPKIN: Look , you 're going to have him all to yourself . What else do you want ?
MARSHA: No .
PUPKIN: You sure ?
MARSHA: Sure I 'm sure . That looks too much like him .
PUPKIN: What do you mean ?
MARSHA: When it 's him it does n't look like him .
PUPKIN: Keep watching .
MARSHA: That 's him .
PUPKIN: Wait a second and follow him .
MARSHA: What about here ?
PUPKIN: Too busy . Keep going .
LANGFORD: What do you want ?
PUPKIN: Just keep walking and do n't talk to anybody . I 'll tell you what to do .
LANGFORD: Look , this is
PUPKIN: Just shut up and get in .
MARSHA: Hi , Jerry .
PUPKIN: I did n't like being so rough out there , Jerry . But I wanted you to know that I meant business . I did n't want anything happening to you ove some misunderstanding .
LANGFORD: You realize what you 're saying .
PUPKIN: Come on , Jerry . This is n't a spu
LANGFORD: What ?
PUPKIN: I 'll say it again
THOMAS' SECRETARY: Bert Thomas ! He 's in a meeting , Mr. Langford I see .
SECRETARY: He says it 's urgent .
THOMAS: Yeah ? Well , tell him I 'll call him ack . It 's that Martino kid , the impressionist .
PUPKIN: Then try again !
THOMAS: Yeah ? Okay , Martino , let 's stop the bullshit what ? Okay , I 'm listening .
LANGFORD: Helen Keller .
PUPKIN: No tricks , Jerry .
THOMAS: Do n't do anything , Jerry . Stay right there . Tell him we 'll do anything he wants . Tell him to cool it . Are you okay ? Look , tell him to call us about five , okay . We 'll let him know what to do . And do n't do anything stupid .
MARSHA: What do you think ?
PUPKIN: Looks fine .
MARSHA: I had to guess on the sleeves . He gets to keep it , does n't he ?
PUPKIN: Sure , if he is n't dead .
THOMAS: I know he 's in a meeting and I do n't care . I 've got to talk to him ! No , he can not call me back . Do n't you understand ? This is an emergency
PUPKIN: This was n't an easy decision fo me , Jerry , believe me . For one thing , I knew it meant we could neve e friends again and that hurt me . It 's hard to lose a friend , even one who has let you down . You always hope you can patch things up . You know , a guy like me does n't make friends that easily .
LANGFORD: Hey , if that 's what 's bothering you , let 's go over to my office and listen to that tape right now .
PUPKIN: Are you crazy , Jerry ? Do you know what would happen to me ?
MARSHA: Am I going to have to hold this thing all day ?
PUPKIN: Just keep it on him . You know , Jerry . Friendship is a two- way street . All that time I was worrying about you and your ratings and everything , you could n't have cared less about me . LANGFORD thinks rapidly for a beat or two .
LANGFORD: You 're right . You know that ? I was thoughtless . It 's just that when you 're doing a big show , it 's hard to tell who your friends really are . I was wrong . I apologize . Why do n't we just shake hands and forget the whole thing ?
PUPKIN: That 's easy to say , Jerry .
LANGFORD: But I mean it . I 'll tell them that the whole thing was a joke and then we can go to my office and listen to that tape . Come on . What do you say ?
MARSHA: Sit down ! LANGFORD looks to PUPKIN .
PUPKIN: What 's the matter ? You heard what he said .
MARSHA: All of a sudden , with a gun on him , he wants to make up and be friends . And , once he 's out the door , what happens then ?
PUPKIN: What happens then , Jerry ?
MARSHA: You get to his office and they jump you , that 's what happens , Rupert .
PUPKIN: She 's right , Jerry .
LANGFORD: Not if I tell them not to . This is Jerry , Rupert , I give you my word .
PUPKIN: He gives me his word .
MARSHA: Yeah ? And what else ? Come on , Rupert , I 'm sick of waiting .
PUPKIN: And what else , Jerry ?
LANGFORD: Come on , Rupert . My word 's good enough , is n't it .
PUPKIN: No , Jerry . It 's not . Keep the gun up !
PATTEN: Look , I tell you , the bureau is doing everything possible to locate Mr. Langford . Right now our men are out checking out every radical group in this city .
AN EXECUTIVE: Radical ?
PATTEN: They 're willing to sacrifice thei leader in order to get their message across , are n't they ? You 've got to figure that this is a desperate outfit . I do n't know who they are anymore than you do . But I do know I 've got to stop them . Otherwise , what you 're seeing here is just the first of a whole wave of these kinds of kidnappings .
THOMAS: Does this mean we 're not supposed to put him on ? ! ?
PATTEN: Who am I addressing , please ?
CROCKETT: That 's Bert Thomas . He produces the show .
PATTEN: I 'm only saying , Mr. Thomas , that we ca n't allow this to reach the public . When the kidnappers call in , of course you 're going to be cooperative . Promise them anything they want . After all , this King character is going to have to show up sooner o later . And once we get our hands on him , he 'll tell us where Mr. Langford is . PATTEN grinds his fist into his palm .
THOMAS: That 's fine , Inspector , but let 's say he finishes his bit and you 've worked him over
PATTEN: Questioned him , Mr. Thomas . There is light laughter .
THOMAS: Okay , questioned him and he still wo n't talk . We get to eleven thirty and what do we do ? Do we air him o what ? There is a heavy pause .
PATTEN: I would say no .
THOMAS: But they might kill Jerry !
CROCKETT: Okay , Burt . Thank you , Inspector . We appreciate your position and we 'll do all we can to cooperate with you . But I have to tell you ight now that , if it comes down to it , we 're not taking any chances with Mr. Langford 's life .
PATTEN: I understand but
CROCKETT: If your men have n't been able to locate Mr. Langford by air time , we 're going to have to put this King guy on , no matter what he 's said . After all , Inspector , what 's ten o fifteen minutes of talk show time against a man 's life ?
PUPKIN: Open . Bite Good .
THOMAS' SECRETARY: Bert Thomas ! Who 's calling please ? Yes , Mr. King .
PATTEN: Keep him talking . THOMAS nods and picks up the phone .
THOMAS: Yes ? Yes , Mr , King . We understand . Everything 's been arranged . Now if you 'll just tell me a little about the nature of your material , so that we can
PUPKIN: I 'll tell you everything you need to know at the studio this evening , Mr. Thomas . I appreciate your co- operation . Goodbye .
MARSHA: I 've got so much to tell you I just do n't know what to begin with . Are you okay ?
CROCKETT: Can Randall* sub for Jerry ?
THOMAS: His agent 's calling us back but it looks good . I only told him Jerry 's sick .
CROCKETT: Well , if worse comes to worse , Cante can always carry it . Let me see your list .
THOMAS: McCabe . The Vanishing Siberian Tiger .
CROCKETT: He 's out .
CATHY LONG: What if we do n't run this King guy ? Who 'll fill the time ?
CROCKETT: We 'll stretch the other guests . But I think we 're going to wind up running him . For one thing , we 've got to think about Jerry .
FIRST EXECUTIVE: And from a news point of view , we 've got a responsibility to air this story .
CROCKETT: Exactly , Lou . I mean , who would you rather watch some tige expert or a live kidnapper .
THOMAS: You 're going to put him on twice ?
SECOND EXECUTIVE: And remember what Patten said about
CROCKETT: Hold on . We can always edit the guy . And , as for a wave of these things , I just do n't buy the idea that there are that many people out there crazy enough to spend thei lives in prison for a few minutes on television .
MCCABE: Good evening , officer . This is the ackstage door I take it ?
GUARD: Your name please ?
MCCABE: Clarence McCabe , the writer . And this is Mrs. McCabe and her parents , Mr. and Mrs. Leroy Solters of Cleveland .
GUARD: I 'm sorry , sir . I do n't see you here .
MCCABE: I 'm on the show tonight , officer .
GUARD: Well , you 're not here .
MCCABE: Look , Cathy Long gave me instructions to present myself at a quarter to six . May I see her please ?
GUARD: I 'm under strictest orders tonight to admit only authorized personnel .
MCCABE: This is absurd . Wait right here .
GUARD: Stop him !
MCCABE: Hey !
PATTEN: Are you the King ? MCCABE looks baffled .
PUPKIN: Excuse me . The CAMERAMAN looks up .
CAMERAMAN: Yeah ?
PATTEN: Do n't talk to me about tigers !
PUPKIN: I 'm the King .
STAGE MANAGER: What can I do for you , your highness ?
CATHY LONG: What are you doing here , Mr . Pupkin ? ! ? !
MARSHA: `` I 'm gon na love you , Like no one 's ever loved you , Come rain or come shine , Happy together , unhappy together , And wo n't it be fine . ''
PATTEN: I hope you brought me the right guy this time . Where 's Jerry Langford ?
PUPKIN: Are you on the show ?
PATTEN: No , Mr. King . That 's my assistant , Mr. Giardello .
PUPKIN: I want to see someone on the show .
PATTEN: Well , you tell us where Mr. Langford is and we 'll let you see anyone you want .
PUPKIN: Just get me someone from the show .
PATTEN: Come on , Mr. King . Let 's not fool around . Should we know about any of these people ?
PUPKIN: That 's Orson Bean .
PATTEN: I see . Check these out .
PUPKIN: Sure I 'll talk . Just get me someone from the show .
PATTEN: Get that Thomas guy in here . GIARDELLO leaves .
PUPKIN: Rupert Pupkin .
PATTEN: That 's your real name ?
PUPKIN: Yes sir .
PATTEN: You an American ?
PUPKIN: Yes .
PATTEN: Then why do you people do these things ? THOMAS enters . He scrutinizes PUPKIN .
PUPKIN: Are you on the show ?
THOMAS: Yes . I 'm Bert Thomas .
PUPKIN: Here 's the introduction to my act . Please make sure Mr. Randall follows it exactly as I 've written it .
PATTEN: Okay . How about helping us , Mr. King ?
PUPKIN: What about make-up ? I need make-up .
PATTEN: Put some color in his cheeks .
MARSHA: It was the second lead ! I 'd neve gotten a part in my life and here I get the second lead . And what does Daddy say ? SHOT of LANGFORD still bound from tip to toe .
PATTEN: How about it , King ?
PUPKIN: If I 'm not on that show , Jerry Langford is dead , I promise you .
TECHNICIAN: Hold on two . Hold . Hold . Come on , Keller . Get it framed !
CANTER: Now ! Direct from New York ! It 's the Jerry Langford Show with guest host Tony Randall and his special guests Olympic swimmer Mark Spitz , pundit Gore Vidal , the one and only Zsa Zsa Gabor and another of Jerry 's taped exclusives , an interview with Prince Ranier of Monaco .

RANDALL: Good evening , ladies and gentlemen . Thank you . Thank you very much . I have some sad news for you . Earlie today , my writing staff was executed in Central Park by the network firing squad so there 'll be no sensational Randall monologue this evening . The AUDIENCE cheers derisively .
TECHNICIAN: Just hold . Three . Pick up the audience .
PUPKIN: Good evening , ladies and gentleman . Let me introduce myself . My name is Rupert Pupkin . I was born in Clifton , New Jersey , which was not , at that time , a federal offense . Is there anyone here from Clifton ? Good . We can all relax . Now , I 'd like to begin by saying that my parents were too poor to afford me a childhood but the fact is nobody is allowed to be really poor in Clifton . Once you fall below eleven thousand you 're exiled to Passaic . My parents did , in fact , put down the first two payments on my childhood . Then they tried to return me to the hospital as defective . But , like everyone else I grew up in large part thanks to my mother . If she was only here today I 'd say , `` Hey , mom . What are you doing here ? You 've been dead fo nine years ? '' You should have seen my mother . She was wonderful blonde , beautiful , intelligent , alcoholic . We used to drink milk together after school . Mine was homogenized . Hers was loaded . Once she was picked up fo speeding . They clocked her doing fifty in our garage . When they tested her they found that he alcohol was two per cent blood . They took away her license and she died shortly afterwards . We used to joke together Mom and me , until the tears would stream down her face and she 'd
LANGFORD: That was a wonderful dinner , Marsha . I want you to know how much I enjoyed it .
MARSHA: We can do it again .
LANGFORD: I 'd like to show you my gratitude . But it 's a little difficult , like this . LANGFORD indicates his bonds .
PUPKIN: A lot of you are probably wondering why Jerry could n't make it this evening . Well , he 's tied up and I 'm the one who tied him . You think I 'm joking , ut that 's the only way I could break into show business by hijacking Jerry Langford . I 'm not kidding . Right now , Jerry Langford is strapped to a bedstead somewhere in the middle of this city . Go ahead . Laugh . But the fact is I 'm here . Tomorrow you 'll know I was n't kidding and you 'll think I was crazy . But I figured it this way better to be King for a Night than Schmuck fo a Lifetime ! ! ! Good night ladies and gentlemen . God less you .
MAE: Who did you get ?
PATTEN: Okay , Pupkin . We 'll start all ove again . Where is Langford ? You know , we 're going to find him sooner or later .
PUPKIN: I 'm trying to tell you , Inspector . You let me walk out of here , right ? And as soon as I 'm seen my act on the show as soon as I 'm sure they 've eally put it on I 'll tell you where Jerry is and you 'll get him back safe and sound .
PATTEN: Fine , Pupkin . Then why do n't you watch the show here with us ? That way we 're all happy . What channel ?
GIARDELLO: Seven .
PATTEN: We get that one in fine . So what do you say , Pupkin ?
PUPKIN: Look , I 'll say it again . You let me go now .
LANGFORD: Watch my hair !
MARSHA: I 'm sorry , baby . We hear the sound of tape ripping .
LANGFORD: Ow !
MARSHA: I 'm sorry .
A PLAINCLOTHESMAN: Still nothing .
PUPKIN: I 've got to get out of here .
PATTEN: You 're not going anywhere , Pupkin . Now , where is he ?
PUPKIN: I 'm telling you , Inspector , if I do n't
PATTEN: Just where is it you want to watch this show ?
LANGFORD: Ow ! God damnit ! Not so fast !
MARSHA: We have n't all night , baby . MARSHA rips the tape off LANGFORD .
LANGFORD: OW ! ! ! !
MARSHA: Oh , I love you , baby . I love you so much .
PATTEN: Here we , are , Pupkin . I do n't know what this is all about , but as soon as you 've seen yourself , you 're going to talk to us or I promise you , you 'll never see daylight again .
PUPKIN: I 'll need a couple of minutes , Inspector .
PUPKIN: After it 's over , I want a couple of minutes . And I 'll need ten dollars . Does anyone of you gentlemen have my wallet ?
PATTEN: Do n't push me , Pupkin .
PUPKIN: A condemned man 's last request , Inspector .
PATTEN: Well , I 'll tell you right away , the answer is no , Pupkin .
PUPKIN: It 's not much of a ransom , Inspector
PATTEN: Look , I 'm drawing the line , that 's all ! No ten dollars and that 's it . No ten dollars ! ! ! ! You understand ? ! ?
PUPKIN: Sure . Sure , Inspector . No ten dollars
PATTEN: Okay .
PUPKIN: and no Jerry Langford . There is a pause as PATTEN stifles himself .
PATTEN: Go ahead . Give him his goddamned ten dollars ! Give him twenty ! I do n't care . Just get him out of here !
PUPKIN: Turn on Langford . Seven .
MOUSY MAN: Hey ! I 'm watching this . RITA keeps staring at PUPKIN .
PUPKIN: Just turn it . Come on .
MOUSY MAN: I was here first , mister . You ca n't just walk in like this . It is n't fair .
MARSHA: Oh , baby . Baby .
LANGFORD: Stop !
MARSHA: Ow !
SECOND FRIEND: HALF-STEWED WOMAN It 's a trick , that 's
PUPKIN: Come on , Rita . Do n't spoil the party . Drinks all around on me .
STEWED WOMAN: What about the hundred and fifty ? We never saw a penny outta your < /u other .
PUPKIN: What 'll you have ?
FIRST FRIEND: I 'm okay . Thanks , pal .
SECOND FRIEND: Me , too .
PUPKIN: I do n't suppose you 're allowed anything . I guess nobody 's in a celebrating mood . How about you ? You want something ?
FIRST PLAINCLOTHESMAN: It 's getting time , Pupkin .
PUPKIN: In a second .
RITA: That was true , was n't it ? about the kidnapping . PUPKIN nods and shrugs .
PUPKIN: Now you can say you knew me . That 's something , anyway .
FIRST PLAINCLOTHESMAN: Come on , Pupkin .
PUPKIN: I guess I 've got go . Take care of yourself , will you . And when you 're ored you know , when you 're brushing your teeth or something , give me a thought , okay ?
RITA: Okay .
SECOND PLAINCLOTHESMAN: Yeah , Pupkin . You threw it all away .
PUPKIN: We 'll see . WE CLOSE IN on PUPKIN , smiling .
CANTER: And now ! Direct from New York ! The Jerry Langford Show , starring Jerry 's special guest , out on bail , Rupert Pupkin , the kidnapping King of Comedy ! ! ! !
BERTIE: You look like a Christmas tree . He smiles wanly .
ELIZABETH: Buck up , Bertie . The BBC said it would n't ain .
COSMO LANG: Ten million people listening around the world , Mam . Possibly more . His brother , and father , have been oadcasting since last year . The King , growing impatient , hisses
BERTIE: Luh-luh-lords , la-la-ladies , gen-tell-men .
COSMO LANG: I would n't miss His Highness ' maiden voyage for all the world . And on such an important occasion . Lang really is a piece of work .
BERTIE: No doubt you wish the Prince Of Wales was standing before you today .
ELIZABETH: Are you there ? From behind a door
LIONEL: Iagoworld 's greatest villain . Just wants to be bad . Sorry , no receptionist .
ELIZABETH: I 'd be more comfortable in your office .
LIONEL: That 's for clients . Where 's Mister J ?
ELIZABETH: He does n't know I 'm here .
LIONEL: That 's not a promising start .
ELIZABETH: My husband 's seen everyone . They were all useless . He 's given up hope .
LIONEL: A bit premature .
ELIZABETH: Because he has n't seen you ? Lionel does n't disgree .
LIONEL: I 'm sure of anyone who wants to be cured .
ELIZABETH: Of course my husband wants to be cured ! His position requires public speaking upon occasion . A torment . I fear the requirement may grow more frequent .
LIONEL: He should change jobs .
ELIZABETH: He ca n't .
LIONEL: Indentured servitude ?
ELIZABETH: Something of that nature .
LIONEL: Well , have your ` hubby ' pop by and give his personal history . I 'll make a frank appraisal .
ELIZABETH: Doctor Logue tries to object but she over-rides .
LIONEL: Sorry , this is my game , played on my turf , y my rules . The lady lifts her veil .
ELIZABETH: Perhaps you 'll make an exception ?
LIONEL: I thought the appointment was fo `` Johnson '' ?
ELIZABETH: A name used during the Great War , when the Navy did n't wish the enemy to know His Royal Highness was aboard .
LIONEL: I 'm considered the enemy ?
ELIZABETH: You will be , should you continue to be un- obliging .
LIONEL: For my method to succeed there must be mutual trust , complete honesty , and total equality . That process takes place in my consultation room . No exceptions .
ELIZABETH: In which case I should have kept my pledge . I promised my husband I 'd stop seeking `` The Great Cure . '' I 've wasted your time . And mine .
LIONEL: Bloody hell , I buggered that .
VALENTINE: Stand and deliver !
LIONEL: ` ow dares molestJack The Ripper ? !
PETER: We 're Swagmen , not Highwaymen , Dad .
LIONEL: Oh . Beware , jolly Swagmen , I 'll skewer ye gizzards .
MYRTLE: You 'll all hang from the gallows if you do n't come for tea .
LIONEL: Boys , I think we 'd best go up .
MYRTLE: Another spoiled silly ?
VALENTINE: May we be excused ?
LIONEL: You must stay , bored stupid , listening to your parents ' inane conversation .
THE BOYS: Thanks , dad !
LIONEL: And mum .
THE BOYS: And mum ! They start to leave .
MYRTLE: Take your plates .
LIONEL: At what I do . Twas a Lady with a capital L .
MYRTLE: Oh , Lionel , that 'd get us home in grand style would n't it ? !
LIONEL: She came on behalf of her husband . Which is not the proper way . I told her I was fully ooked . Myrtle is clearly disappointed
MYRTLE: We would n't want that . Covers her letdown .
LIONEL: Had a call . Wish me luck ?
MYRTLE: Course , Lionel . Loads and loads .
ELIZABETH: `` Mr. and Mrs . Darling and Nana rushed into the nursery too late . The birds were flown . ''
MARGARET ROSE: Oh , to fly away !
BERTIE: Were n't they lucky .
LILIBET: One would have to learn to fly properly of course .
MARGARET ROSE: Now a Daddy story !
BERTIE: Can I be a penguin instead ?
LILIBET: The horsie story , please .
BERTIE: Ah well .
LILIBET: A silly story really . But Father tells it ather well . The girls have gone .
BERTIE: David called . He said come round to The Fort on Friday and stay for dinner .
ELIZABETH: Will she be there ?
BERTIE: I suppose .
ELIZABETH: Seriously ?
BERTIE: Seriously , she 'll be there .
ELIZABETH: I think I meant is David serious ?
BERTIE: About our coming ?
ELIZABETH: About her !
BERTIE: A married American ? Twice divorced ? He ca n't be .
ELIZABETH: She can .
DIRECTOR: Now ! Someone pushes through a gap . Its Lionel .
LIONEL: `` Now '' Falters , begins again .
DIRECTOR: Thank you . Beautiful dictionbut I do n't hear the cries of a deformed creature yearning to be King .
LIONEL: What do you suggest ?
DIRECTOR: Continue to do whatever you do , and hope it gives you a great deal of satisfaction . Crushed , Lionel retreats behind the curtain .
BERTIE: I d-d-do n't thu-thu-think I c-c-can .
ELIZABETH: You know perfectly well .
BERTIE: David has ` the touch ' . They adore him .
ELIZABETH: There 's no receptionist .
BERTIE: How 'd you find this physician ?
ELIZABETH: Classifieds ; next to `` Saucy model , Shepherd 's Market '' . Bertie smiles despite his mood .
BERTIE: I 'm not sure I want to see this fellow .
ELIZABETH: I 'm not sure he wants to see you .
ANNA: You can go in now , `` Mr. Johnson '' .
BERTIE: I 'm not actually Mr
ANNA: I know . Dr Logue says
BERTIE: My wife 's favorite colours .
LIONEL: Glad we have something in common . Bertie 's head bangs into one of the models .
BERTIE: Please
LIONEL: What ?
BERTIE: You 're too close . Five paces is the rule of thumb .
LIONEL: That might be difficult in this office .
BERTIE: I ca n't discuss that .
LIONEL: What can we talk about ?
BERTIE: That 's better . When speaking with a Royal one waits for the Royal to start the conversation and chose the topic .
LIONEL: Your joking . That wo n't work here .
BERTIE: I admit if one waits for me to start a conversation one can wait a rather long time . Silence . They stare at each other .
LIONEL: You call this being forthcoming ?
BERTIE: Are n't you interested in treating me ?
LIONEL: Only if you 're interested in being cured . More silence .
BERTIE: No thank you .
LIONEL: I need one . Turns on the hot plate .
BERTIE: Apparently a great deal of rudeness , Docto Logue .
LIONEL: Call me Lionel .
BERTIE: I prefer Doctor .
LIONEL: I prefer Lionel . My family calls me fa worse . What shall I call you ?
BERTIE: The Duke of York is appropriate .
LIONEL: Oh please .
BERTIE: Your Royal Highness then .
LIONEL: Much more informal .
BERTIE: Prince Albert ? Or Frederick ? Arthur ? George ? I 've lots of names to choose from .
LIONEL: How about Bertie ?
BERTIE: Only my family uses that .
LIONEL: That 's what I 'll call you then . We must be true equals .
BERTIE: If we were equal I would n't be here , I 'd be at home with my family and no-one would give a damn .
LIONEL: Do n't do that . Bertie gives him an astonished look .
BERTIE: My physicians say it 's good for stuttering , elaxes the throat .
LIONEL: They 're idiots .
BERTIE: They 've all been knighted .
LIONEL: Makes it official then . House rules no smoking .
BERTIE: I thought here we 're `` equal '' .
LIONEL: As a monarchist I thought you 'd appreciate these are my digs and here I rule . No smoking . What was your earliest memory ?
BERTIE: I beg your pardon ?
LIONEL: First recollection of the world ?
BERTIE: I 'm not here to discuss personal matters .
LIONEL: Why 're you here then ?
BERTIE: Because I bloody well stutter ! And you loody well ca n't fix it ! ! !
LIONEL: Temper .
BERTIE: One of my numerous faults .
LIONEL: Do you stutter when you think ?
BERTIE: Do n't be ridiculous .
LIONEL: One of my many faults . How about when you talk to yourself ?
BERTIE: I do n't talk to myself !
LIONEL: Come on , everyone natters to themselves once in a while , Bertie .
BERTIE: Stop calling me that !
LIONEL: Sha n't call you anything else .
BERTIE: Then we sha n't speak !
LIONEL: Loads . Now when you talk to yourself , do you stutter ?
BERTIE: Of course not !
LIONEL: Proving your impediment is n't a permanent internal fixture .
BERTIE: When I give a speechI bloody stutter ! ! !
LIONEL: Bet you a bob you can read flawlessly , ight here , right now .
BERTIE: Easy money . You 're on .
LIONEL: See your shilling then .
BERTIE: Royals do n't carry money .
LIONEL: How convenient .
BERTIE: If there is a next time .
LIONEL: Correct , I have n't agreed to take you on .
BERTIE: I certainly ca n't read The Bard .
LIONEL: ` Easy money ' .
BERTIE: `` To be or not to be , That is the question . Whether it is wiser '' There !
LIONEL: Not so fast .
BERTIE: I proved I ca n't read .
LIONEL: You proved you ca n't listen .
BERTIE: You 're playing music .
LIONEL: I 'm aware .
BERTIE: How can I hear what I 'm saying ? !
LIONEL: Bertie , you 're Royal . Surely a prince 's ain knows what its mouth is doing ?
BERTIE: You 're not well acquainted with Royal princes , are you ?
LIONEL: I want to demonstrate that when you ca n't hear your voice , you do n't stutter , thus proving your impediment is not innate .
BERTIE: Rubbish .
LIONEL: Flawless .
BERTIE: I know how I sound !
LIONEL: Would I lie to a prince of the realm to win twelve-pence ?
BERTIE: I 've no idea what an Australian might do for that sort of money .
LIONEL: Souvenir of our first and presumably last encounter . Bertie glances at the record . POV - the label HMV His Master 's Voice .
BERTIE: I 'm finished with Doctor Logue !
LIONEL: Lionel . They exit curtly .
WILLIE'S MUM: Was that ?
LIONEL: Certainly not . How 's it going , mate ?
WILLIE'S MUM: William is n't trying hard enough .
LIONEL: Willie ?
WILLIE: Ddddddoooing ggggggggood .
LIONEL: Why am I not surprised ?
BERTIE: The bloody man did parlour tricks and cheated me out of a shilling .
ELIZABETH: They 'll see . He quickly rolls up the window . The sound of an approaching aircraft engine .
DAVID: Hello , B-b-bertie . B-b-been waiting long ?
BERTIE: Three days . Where 've you been ?
DAVID: I was busy .
BERTIE: So was I. Elizabeth has pneumonia .
DAVID: She 'll recover . Bertie shoots him a look .
BERTIE: Father wo n't .
DAVID: He 's doing this on purpose .
BERTIE: Dying ? !
DAVID: Some sod tipped him off Wallis is getting a quickie divorce and we 're going to make ou marriage a fait accompli . As an act of pure spite , Father 's trying to depart prematurely in order to complicate matters . The break almost careens off the lane .
BERTIE: You believe that ?
DAVID: Wallis explained it . She 's terribly clever .
WIGRAM: The Instruments Of Succession , You Majesty .
QUEEN MARY: I want my jewelry divided equally . Elizabeth gets first choice . She 's not greedy .
BERTIE: May I remind you , you 're not the one who 's dying , Mother .
QUEEN MARY: Where are the others ?
BERTIE: Lord Wigram and Dr Dawson are making arrangements .
QUEEN MARY: What sort of arrangements ?
BERTIE: They did n't say .
QUEEN MARY: And David ? Fetch him .
DAVID: I 'm on with Wallis !
BERTIE: Mother says you 're late for supper . David glares at a clock .
DAVID: Clocks set five minutes in advance , so as not to be late . When I 'm King I shall set them back !
QUEEN MARY: Lord Wigram has requested permission to order the coffin .
BULTER: The Archbishop of Canterbury .
DAVID: Who the hell invited him ? !
QUEEN MARY: Nobody . Do n't swear .
DAVID: Somebody should bloody well dis-invite him . Father swears .
WIGRAM: That would be rash .
QUEEN MARY: You 're not your father .
WIGRAM: His Grace can be a persistent enemy . We need friends .
DAVID: Show the toad in . Lang is already sweeping towards them .
COSMO LANG: Whatever can I contribute in this dreadful hour ? !
WIGRAM: Peacefully . The others nod .
COSMO LANG: `` The King 's life is moving peacefully to its '' `` Termination '' ?
WIGRAM: Close .
COSMO LANG: `` to its close . ''
WIGRAM: As a man of letters you 're heaven-sent to assist in the editing of our press communique . Lang beams .
DAVID: Is my father late for death ?
WIGRAM: We would n't want the news delivered by the disreputable afternoon press , would we ? The brothers look at him . He expains
COSMO LANG: Who knows what sensational side issues those tabloids might report .
DAWSON: Perhaps a peaceful termination ? All eyes on David .
NURSE: No ! that 's
DAWSON: You may leave . She does so , sobbing .
QUEEN MARY: Long live the King .
BERTIE: The look in mother 's eyes , it wasghastly .
ELIZABETH: Bertie
BERTIE: The man was a total fraud !
ELIZABETH: Not particularly .
BERTIE: Well I think you should . You should know what goes on . Telling me he could help me ead flawlessly . Lying bastard ! Listen to this babble !
WINSTON CHURCHILL: Turn that devil off ! The hysteria stops .
BALDWIN: Chamberlain thinks that Hitler can be easoned with .
WINSTON CHURCHILL: Neville is an old woman .
BALDWIN: That 's the direction its going , Winston . You 're out of step .
WINSTON CHURCHILL: We 'll see who trips and falls .
BALDWIN: Enough pleasantries . I 've asked you here ecause you seem to be the only sensible member of the King 's camp .
WINSTON CHURCHILL: Nice of you to say so , Stanley .
BALDWIN: Is he willing to be reasonable ?
WINSTON CHURCHILL: Depends on the definition .
BALDWIN: Has he seen the light ?
WINSTON CHURCHILL: He has . Baldwin brightens .
VALENTINE: Dad ?
LIONEL: Mmmm ?
VALENTINE: Time for a Shake , dad .
LIONEL: You sure ?
THE BOYS: Shake ! Shake ! Shake !
IAN: Bet its the Scottish Play .
VALENTINE: Othello !
PETER: Perhaps something with Falstaff ? Ominous thumps within the closet .
THE BOYS: Caliban !
LIONEL: `` Be not afeard ; the isle is full of noises , Sounds and sweet airs , that give delight , and hurt not . Sometimes a thousand twanging instruments Will hum about mine ears ; and sometimes voices , That , if then I had waked after long sleep , Will make me sleep again and then , in dreaming , The clouds methought would open , and show iches Ready to drop upon me ; that , when I waked , I cried to dream again . ''
BERTIE'S VOICE: Doctor Logue ?
LIONEL: Must be a tradesman . Off you go , lads . Mum should be home from work .
BERTIE'S VOICE: Logue ? Logue , expressionless , does n't respond .
BERTIE: Lionelit 's Bertie . The door opens .
LIONEL: My condolences . I did n't expect you .
BERTIE: Thank you . I did n't expect to be here . May I come in ?
LIONEL: No .
BERTIE: What ?
LIONEL: My wife does n't think it 's a good idea .
BERTIE: Your wife ?
LIONEL: Myrtle .
BERTIE: Myrtle ? Myrtle 's never met me . I 've neve met Myrtle . May we discuss Myrtle in private ? Its not proper talking about ou women on the street . Lonel gives him a look , but lets him him .
LIONEL: Sore back .
BERTIE: What 's your Myrtle got to do with me ? Elizabeth does n't much care for you either , ut here I am .
LIONEL: That woman has style .
BERTIE: Which is why she dislikes you . You 're fa too familiar . May we discuss this properly ?
LIONEL: You look dreadful .
BERTIE: Another example of exactly the sort of thing you do n't say to a Royal . And you 're too close .
LIONEL: But you 're not Royal in this room .
BERTIE: Which is precisely why Elizabeth dislikes you . He starts to sit .
LIONEL: Not there !
BERTIE: Oh I say , I 'm terribly sorry . Tell you lads I 'll buy a new one .
LIONEL: You do n't have any money . I 'll fix it . So , Bertie , what brings you here ? Your father 's death ? Bertie is silent .
BERTIE: What was he angry about ?
LIONEL: I was a great disappointment .
BERTIE: Thought he 'd be proud of you .
LIONEL: So did I .
BERTIE: A man of stature ?
LIONEL: A clerk .
BERTIE: Oh .
LIONEL: Coughed herself to death when I was young .
BERTIE: Oh .
LIONEL: I remember going to the theatre with her . Not real theatretraveling players .
BERTIE: I 've been to Australia .
LIONEL: Not where I lived .
BERTIE: My brother . That 's why I 'm here .
LIONEL: What 's he done ?
BERTIE: Ca n't say .
LIONEL: I 'm going home now .
BERTIE: You must undersand , I ca n't puh-puh-puh His jaw and throat muscles constrict .
LIONEL: Try singing it .
BERTIE: Pardon ?
LIONEL: Know any songs ?
BERTIE: `` Swanee River '' .
LIONEL: Very modern .
BERTIE: Happens to be my favorite .
LIONEL: Sing it .
BERTIE: Certainly not . May I help ? Always wanted to build models . Father would n't allow it . I had to collect stamps . He collected stamps .
LIONEL: Only if you sing . Goes like this `` Way down upon the ''
BERTIE: I know the words ! `` Way down upon the Swanee River. `` Etcetera .
LIONEL: You did n't stutter .
BERTIE: Of course I did n't stutter , I was singing ! One does n't stutter when one sings ! ) Oh Well I ca n't waltz around on State occasions warbling !
LIONEL: You can with me .
BERTIE: That 's because you 're peculiar .
LIONEL: I take that as a compliment . Cut some struts from the balsa . Sorry , hard to show you what to do at five paces . Would you like a cup of tea ?
BERTIE: No . Yes . Thank you .
LIONEL: You were about to sing an aria concerning your brother .
BERTIE: I 'm not crooning to the tune of `` Swanee River ! ''
LIONEL: Try `` Camptown Races '' then . `` The Arch of C , he said to me , doo-dah doo- dah '' That sort of thing .
BERTIE: I ca n't talk , or sing , about your future King , doo-dah , doo-dah
LIONEL: My future King ? He 's your future King too . Did that cause friction ? Knowing he 'd grow up to be King , but you would n't .
BERTIE: Certainly not . I 've always looked up to David . Water 's boiling . Lionel makes the pot .
LIONEL: Two lumps or one ?
BERTIE: I 've a sweet tooth . To tell the truth
LIONEL: Always preferable . Cover it with tissue .
BERTIE: it was a relief . Knowing I would n't be King .
LIONEL: Why 's that ?
BERTIE: I would n't have to give speeches !
LIONEL: No smoking . What 's the age difference ?
BERTIE: Eighteen months .
LIONEL: But for eighteen months you would 've been King ? !
BERTIE: We did n't think about it that way , doctor . Doo-dah doo-dah . David and I were very close .
LIONEL: As you said eighteen months .
BERTIE: As brothers !
LIONEL: How close ?
BERTIE: Young bucks You know .
LIONEL: I do n't , or I would n't ask . Did you go after the same girls ?
BERTIE: Upon occasion .
LIONEL: Princess Elizabeth ?
BERTIE: What an extraordinarily rude thing to say ! David did try to be her beau at one point . Before I met her . She would n't have him .
LIONEL: Now dope the other wing . Did David tease you ?
BERTIE: They all did . `` Buh-buh-buh-Bertie '' . Fathe encouraged it . `` Spit it out , boy ! '' Thought it would make me stop . Is this necessary ? !
LIONEL: Otherwise the paint will eat through the tissue .
BERTIE: I mean the damn questions !
LIONEL: Mandatory . Tell me more about you storybook childhood . What was your earliest memory ?
BERTIE: You asked that before .
LIONEL: This time I 'd like an answer .
BERTIE: Being born .
LIONEL: How can you remember that ?
BERTIE: December 14th .
LIONEL: I do n't understand .
BERTIE: `` Mausoleum Day '' . Prince Albert departed on that date . I was named Bertie to placate Great Grandmamma Victoria . In return , she hated me because it reminded her of he grief .
LIONEL: And ?
BERTIE: I was punished . Now I 'm right handed .
LIONEL: Anything else ?
BERTIE: Bandy legs . Also considered inappropriate . Lionel waits .
LIONEL: You sound angry .
BERTIE: Yes , I told you , I have a temper .
LIONEL: Angry at me , or at your brother ?
BERTIE: He 's fallen in love !
LIONEL: How dreadful .
BERTIE: With the wrong sort of woman !
LIONEL: What 's wrong with her ?
BERTIE: She 's American .
LIONEL: Some of them must be lovable .
BERTIE: This one 's divorced . Twice . Mrs Wallis Simpson of Baltimore . I want David to be happy , but the family , the Church , the nation , wo n't have it .
LIONEL: Ca n't they fornicate privately like adults ?
BERTIE: If only ! David used to prefer married women ecause there was no possible attachment . But now
LIONEL: `` Queen Wallis of Baltimore '' ?
BERTIE: Please .
LIONEL: Does sound a bit iffy .
BERTIE: I made a smudge !
LIONEL: Touch it up .
BERTIE: You want me to beg for help ?
LIONEL: I advise you never to beg . Especially if you might be King .
BERTIE: Do n't say that !
LIONEL: I see . For reasons you can not disclose , fearing ramifications you will not explain , you feel sufficiently anxious to embark upon a course of therapy in which you have no faith ? You already owe me a shilling .
BERTIE: I brought it along . You won , fair and square . I 'll pay you generously . Lionel pockets the coin .
LIONEL: I 'll continue to ask questions .
BERTIE: That 's what I was afraid of .
LIONEL: Nice job . Bertie sees Lionel glance at his watch .
BERTIE: You 've someone waiting ?
LIONEL: I do now .
BERTIE: I 'd apologize to them in person , but
LIONEL: You do n't wish to be seen ? Slip out the ack way .
BERTIE: After the funeralit may be even more difficult . To remain unobserved .
LIONEL: You 're having second thoughts . Bertie 's silence is confirmation .
BERTIE: Perhaps the wrong sort .
LIONEL: We live in South Kensington , small apartment , but no one would see you . Lots of planes .
BERTIE: You know , Lionel , you 're the first ordinary Englishman
LIONEL: Australian .
BERTIE: I 've ever really talked to . Sometimes , when I ride through the streets and see a ` bloke ' I 'm struck by how little I know of his life , and how little he knows of mine . Cuts both ways .
LIONEL: And if you decide to come , bring the Duchess . She might be helpful .
BERTIE: She might . If I asked . Very nicely . And how will Myrtle take to our coming into your home ?
LIONEL: Not sure . She is n't speaking to me . Wants to go home . After the funeral then ?
WILLIE'S MUM: Still ca n't say a sentence .
LIONEL: Willie ?
WILLIE: Iiiiiii 'm much bbbbbbbetter .
LIONEL: Well done .
DIGNITARY: Whereas it has pleased Almighty God to call to His mercy our late Sovereign , King George the Fifth of blessed and glorious memory
COSMO LANG: Do n't be disingenuous . For our late King 's crown to fall from his coffin is not a fortuitous portent . What ever is going to happen next ?
WINSTON CHURCHILL: Is that be the motto of the new reign ? Indeed , will there actually be `` a new eign '' ?
COSMO LANG: Winston ! I 'm deeply shocked .
WINSTON CHURCHILL: You do n't look it .
COSMO LANG: My function requires me to appear serene .
WINSTON CHURCHILL: That may be increasingly difficult to maintain . I 've been informed by no less an authority than the Prime Minister that ou populace has no objection to Royal fornication , but will never tolerate adultery .
COSMO LANG: Well , since we can not acquire a new populace , perhaps we need a new King ?
WINSTON CHURCHILL: My turn to be profoundly shocked . Neither look the slightest traumatized .
COSMO LANG: Scoff , Churchill ! Go on scoff ! But you more than others know full well we 'll soon e under siege from the forces of darkness .
WINSTON CHURCHILL: The winds of wara gathering storm ?
COSMO LANG: Oh , you do have a way with words . And who would you suggest to rally the troops , the nation , the Empire , the world ?
WINSTON CHURCHILL: Would you prefer the next brother ? INTERCUT to Henry , the Duke of Gloucester .
COSMO LANG: The youngest , perhaps ? INTERCUT to George , the Duke of Kent .
WINSTON CHURCHILL: Now there 's dimness .
COSMO LANG: I must admitunburdened with brain .
WINSTON CHURCHILL: Thus we 're left with David , the rightful heir , who speaks beautifully , even if he talks nonsense . Below , the coffin is entering the Chapel .
DAVID: Hear you 're taking elocution lessons , lad .
BERTIE: Pardon ?
DAVID: Diction . Speechifying . That 's the word around Town .
BERTIE: Merely trying to overcome my dreadful impediment
DAVID: Replace me ? Welltoday 's your chance .
BERTIE: I 'm not prepared !
DAVID: As a Boy Scoutand you are one , are n't you , very much a Boy Scoutyou must always be prepared . Nice and loud , so everyone can hear .
BERTIE: III thu-thu-think we should tuh-tuh- table the document .
DAVID: Tell the others how Mrs Simpson is to be accommodated in a special alcove above the altar . Now I 'll be off . See you at Balmoral this weekend , Buh-buh-Bertie . In the room , they are appalled . Bertie stands frozen and shattered .
BERTIE: Wait down the road .
LOCAL LAD: Kick it ` ere , aye , Guv ? Bertie kicks it . A fine high shot .
LIONEL: To be honest , was n't sure whether to expect you .
BERTIE: I was n't sure either .
LIONEL: Something happened ? Bertie stares at his mentor . Nods .
BERTIE: Do I look like a spy ?
LIONEL: With a toothache . They disappear inside .
BERTIE: I was totally unable to speak .
LIONEL: You seldom stutter with me anymore . The boys are a bit untidy .
BERTIE: Because you 're paid to listen !
LIONEL: Like a verbal geisha girl ?
BERTIE: What more does a man need , eh ?
LIONEL: Coming from a man who 's lived all his life in castles and palaces .
BERTIE: Somebody has to live in them .
LIONEL: Somebody does . Ushers Bertie into his study .
BERTIE: I could n't say anything !
LIONEL: You could 've refused . Do n't you know any ude words ?
BERTIE: What a bloody stupid question ! I just said one . Bloody . Bloodybloodybloody !
LIONEL: Perhaps a touch more vulgar ?
BERTIE: Certainly not .
LIONEL: To prove you know how .
BERTIE: Bugger !
LIONEL: A public school prig could do better .
BERTIE: Well bloody bugger to you , you beastly astard !
LIONEL: Hardly robust .
BERTIE: Shit then . Shit , shit , shit !
LIONEL: See how defecation flows trippingly from the tongue ? You do n't stutter when you swear .
BERTIE: Because I 'm angry !
LIONEL: Get angry more often . Do you know the f- word ?
BERTIE: Fornication ?
LIONEL: Oh Bertie
BERTIE: Fuck . Fuck , fuck , fuck !
LIONEL: Bravissimo ! Now a resounding chorus of
BERTIE: Bloody , bloody . bloody ! Shit , shit , shit ! Bugger , bugger , bugger ! Fuck , fuck , fuck ! A pounding on the wall .
LIONEL: Sorry , pet ! Wo n't happen again !
BERTIE: Apologies , Mrs. Logue .
LIONEL: First time I 've heard you laugh .
BERTIE: Royals are n't allowed emotions in public .
LIONEL: Which explains a lot . Bertie is in no mood to be provoked .
BERTIE: What do you want me to do , dammit ! ? Stage my next public appearance as an obscene operetta ? !
LIONEL: Your next public appearance should be very well rehearsed .
BERTIE: Do n't take liberties ! You 're a dangerous man , Logue . Who sent you ?
LIONEL: Anyone in mind ?
BERTIE: The lurking shadows . Courtiers and peersthe whole panoply of a class which once ruled the nation which once ruled the world , afraid of losing their last vestige of privilege if the monarchy is furthe debased .
LIONEL: Your wife was the one who sought me out .
BERTIE: Because , dear sweet deluded woman , she elieves in me !
LIONEL: But you do n't share her belief ? Why come here ?
BERTIE: I 'm beginning to ask myself that very same question . Your sailing close to the edge , do n't push me , Doctor Logue .
LIONEL: Lionel .
BERTIE: I came here because I was taught from childhood to serve a purpose , and that purpose is to serve . Duty is our sole justification for privilege .
LIONEL: Not to worry . They say the King can do no wrong .
BERTIE: He can bugger things up ! And I am not the King . Mrs. Simpson is seeking a divorce . The Coronation is set for the 12th of May . Her decree becomes final on the 27th of April . That gives them two weeks to marry and put this issue to rest .
LIONEL: And if Mr Baldwin stops them ?
BERTIE: That would be a tragedy . I pray to The Almighty they succeed . I 'll do anything within my power to keep my brother on the throne .
LIONEL: Does that include debasing yourself ?
BERTIE: If necessary !
LIONEL: Your brother knew perfectly well by giving you a document without warning
BERTIE: Are you saying he wanted me to fail ?
LIONEL: Are you insisting he did n't ? In the future we can parse any document into manageable phrases . You can sing them , swear them , ehearse them til you get the rhythm and flow ; that , combined with your growing confidence Bertie does n't want to hear .
BERTIE: Growing confidence ? Growing dread ! ! ! You 're a wicked man , Lionel Logue , trying to get me to thrust myself forward as an alternative to my brother . Trying to get me to commit treason !
LIONEL: Trying to get you to realize you need not e governed by fear . Again , why did you seek me out ? To take polite elocution lessons so you could attend posh tea parties ? !
BERTIE: How dare you ! I 'm the brother of a Kingthe son of a Kingback through untold centuries . You presume to instruct me on my duty ? A jumped-up jackeroo from the outback ? The disappointing son of an embittered clerk ! You 're a monster , Docto Logue . I 'm going to Balmoral to spend a pleasant country weekend with my beloved other . And these sessions are over !
DIRECTOR: Were you told ? We are n't for London . Playing the provinces .
LIONEL: Outer Mongolia ?
DIRECTOR: Available , are we ?
LIONEL: Nothing prevents .
DIRECTOR: I believe that 's called `` desperate for a part ! '' Previous experience ?
LIONEL: Australia .
DIRECTOR: You have played the provinces . Righto ! Let 's hear what you can do .
LIONEL: Caliban ?
DIRECTOR: Make him deformed . Audiences like that .
LIONEL: Of course . `` Be not afeard ; the isle is full of noises , Sounds and sweet airs , that give delight , and hurt not . ''
DIRECTOR: Thank you ! Do n't abandon your day job . Next ! Logue bows his head .
LIONEL: You may leave .
VALENTINE: Have n't finished yet , Dad . Oh ! Right !
THE BOYS: Thanks , Dad . Thanks , Mum .
MYRTLE: Lionel ?
LIONEL: First class . A long pause as Myrtle digests this .
MYRTLE: What about your
LIONEL: Willie 's a problemnot much progress . The others have been referred .
MYRTLE: What 'll you do when we get home ?
LIONEL: Try not to act the toff . Teach perhaps .
MYRTLE: You could
LIONEL: No ! I 'm not good enough !
MYRTLE: You gave it a try , Lionel .
LIONEL: Yes , I had a go . Thanks to your patience . I just bloody well was n't good enough !
MYRTLE: Oh Lionel ! This must 've cost you . CHOP ! CHOP ! CHOP ! The sound of an axe .
WINSTON CHURCHILL: Five hundred year old oaks ! Part of the hill ! Removed to improve the view !
COSMO LANG: How ever does she do it ?
WINSTON CHURCHILL: Erotic sexual techniques beyond polite imagination ? I realize of course , that may e outside your personal experience .
COSMO LANG: You 've the Devil in you today .
WINSTON CHURCHILL: If anyone should know , it would be You Grace .
COSMO LANG: All aspects of mankind are within my venue . Did you know , HM has trouble with his glands ? Churchill almost chokes on his champagne .
WINSTON CHURCHILL: I 'd not appreciated Your Grace was so well versed concerning things testicular !
COSMO LANG: They were severely damaged by the measles when HM and his brother were naval cadets .
WINSTON CHURCHILL: A veritable encyclopedic font of scatological information .
COSMO LANG: Apparently it affects the quality , although not the quantity , of HM 's endeavors .
WINSTON CHURCHILL: And the brother ?
COSMO LANG: Unscathed . Two daughters . I shepherd my flock in all matters , Winston , including multiplication .
BERTIE: We must try to be pleasant .
ELIZABETH: Your father not dead six months , and That Woman throws , `` A garden potty . '' P-o-t-t-y . She 's sleeping in your mother 's bedroom . And I know perfectly well she calls me ` the Dowdy Duchess '' , and `` Cookie '' .
WINSTON CHURCHILL: Has it occurred to you , as it has only occurred to me , that a Monarch with a gland problem , who realizes he can not produce issue , might not wish to be King ? knowing his lack of issue may well become a major issue indeed .
COSMO LANG: A dazzling conceptbeautifully phrased . A FOOTMAN announces
FOOTMAN: Their Royal Highnesses the Duke and Duchess of York .
ELIZABETH: I came at the invitation of the King .
WINSTON CHURCHILL: According to the F.B.I . she is , afte all , one of their citizensour Monarch does not possess exclusive rights to Mrs. Simpson 's sexual favours . Hitler 's Ambassador , Count von Ribbentrop , has been sending her 17 carnations every dayone for each time they 've slept together .
COSMO LANG: Good Lord , Winston , we must see to it this Empress of the Night does not become Queen of England !
WINSTON CHURCHILL: Vividly put .
ELIZABETH: I do n't need to be told I behaved badly .
WINSTON CHURCHILL: On the contrary , Mam . Court etiquette decrees royalty must be greeted by the official host . In this case the King . You ehaved impeccably . As always .
ELIZABETH: Distant .
WINSTON CHURCHILL: You 're well aware , of course , George IV 's wife , Mrs. Fitzherbert , was very common indeedand previously married . She signed an agreement that she could never become Queen , and their children could not be Royal . A rather sensible morganatic arrangement .
ELIZABETH: That was a very long time ago . You 're stirring with a rather large spoon , Winston . Keep in mind , I 'm also a distant elative of Lady Macbeth .
WINSTON CHURCHILL: I would disremember at my peril .
BERTIE: David
DAVID: Wally wants more champagne . I have to fetch it . She prefers that .
BERTIE: Been trying to see you
DAVID: Been terribly busy .
BERTIE: Doing what ?
DAVID: Being King .
BERTIE: Where did you get that American accent ? DavidFather 's not dead six months , yet you 've put Mrs. Simpson in the suite used y our mother ?
DAVID: Mama 's not still in bed , is she ?
BERTIE: That is n't funny .
DAVID: Ssssssorry , d-d-dear b-b-oy !
BERTIE: Please . No more of that .
DAVID: Did n't realize you cared .
BERTIE: This could end in disaster .
DAVID: This will end splendidly . With Wallis as my wife .
BERTIE: Whatever will she call herself ?
DAVID: Queen of England , I suspect . Kings do marry . Empress of India . The whole bag of tricks .
BERTIE: David ! The upper classes are terrified anything which clouds the monarchy makes their situation more dangerous . Hunge marchers are singing the `` Red Flag '' in front of Westminsterdemanding a epublicI 've seen them
DAVID: Herr Hitler will sort that out .
BERTIE: Who 'll sort out Chancellor Hitler ?
DAVID: He 's much maligned . By the Jews , according to Wallis . And she 's very clever about politics .
BERTIE: The man 's a monster ! Our position must emain clear .
DAVID: Why 's that , old chap ?
BERTIE: We are a German family !
DAVID: Did n't bother anyone during WWI . And Kaise Willie was our uncle .
BERTIE: Because we took an English name ! Windsor . Because we are England . We are the heart and soul of this nation . That must neve change .
DAVID: Are you already in charge ?
BERTIE: I 'm trying to warn you .
DAVID: Am I being threatened ?
BERTIE: David , your role is to consult and to be advised .
DAVID: Sounds like you 've studied our wretched constitution .
BERTIE: Sounds like you have n't .
DAVID: I wo n't be a lackey to an unwashed politician like Stanley Baldwin !
BERTIE: He 's your Prime Minister .
DAVID: And I 'm his King !
BERTIE: If you refuse to listen to our Government , they have no choice but to resign .
DAVID: I 'll form another . There 's Winston . He 'd love to be P.M. We 'll create a King 's Party .
BERTIE: To fight a general election in which you marriage is the only topic ?
DAVID: I 'd risk anything and everything fo Wallis . Do n't I have rights ?
BERTIE: Privileges .
DAVID: Not the same thing .
BERTIE: No .
DAVID: Yet an ordinary man may marry for love .
BERTIE: We 're not ordinary men , David ! We were bred to be profiles on a coin . If you were ordinary , on what basis could you possibly claim to be King ? !
DAVID: What 's the point then ? Just to look posh ? You knowyour speech is much improved tonight . Hardly a hesitation . Yearning fo a larger audience , are we ?
BERTIE: Do n't say such a thing !
DAVID: Is my young brother trying to push me off the throne ? Sounds positively medieval .
BERTIE: I beg of you , do n't do this to my wife , my daughters , to me .
DAVID: The politicians will give in . See you at my CoronationBertie .
BALDWIN: As you may have guessed Churchill is silent . Balwin waits , then
WINSTON CHURCHILL: My opportunity to redecorate will come soon enough , Stanley .
BALDWIN: Will it ? Well , enough chit-chat . The question of a morganatic marriage , as a possible solution , has been put to the Dominion Prime Ministers . After all , HM is their King too . Baldwin has a sheath of telegrams in hand .
WINSTON CHURCHILL: David feels there are n't that many people in Australia .
BALDWIN: Canada no . Union of South Africa an inappropriate marriage would create a permanent wound . The Irish Free State states it is not really their affair , and , luntly , our English King may marry any whore he wants , they 'll be well out of it .
WINSTON CHURCHILL: Bloody Irish .
BALDWIN: New Zealandwavers .
WINSTON CHURCHILL: Ah , the Kiwis !
BALDWIN: Being rather remote , they 've not even heard of Mrs Simpson . Hardly a winning hand . Silence .
WINSTON CHURCHILL: He wo n't budge .
BALDWIN: Nor will we .
BERTIE: Do n't dismount .
WINSTON CHURCHILL: Good of you to see me at this late hour .
BERTIE: Thought you were in David 's camp ?
WINSTON CHURCHILL: I was . `` I am now free to tell you how I was jockeyed out of the Throne . ''
BERTIE: Good Lord ! My brother wrote that ?
WINSTON CHURCHILL: Wallis wrote it for him . I 'll burn it . I fear your brother is like the child in a fairy story , given everything in the world , ut they forgot his soul . Quite happy to ing his nation to the brink of civil wa just as we face global conflict .
BERTIE: We 're not coming to that ? !
WINSTON CHURCHILL: Oh , there 'll be war , alright . Your brother held conversations with the Duke of Saxe-Coburg , your cousin , a ranking member of the Nazi party . I have the Scotland Yard intercept `` Who is King here ? Baldwin or I ? I myself wish to talk with Hitler , and will do so here or in Germany . '' I doubt England is ready to return to absolute monarchy .
BERTIE: Surely his motives are misunderstood ?
WINSTON CHURCHILL: `` If I do n't get my way , when the war comes , Hitler will crush everyone , including the Americans . The British may not want me as their King , but I 'll soon be back as thei leader . '' His intent seems crystal clear .
BERTIE: Winston ? ! Do n't take him seriously !
WINSTON CHURCHILL: Mugs for his cancelled Coronation will soon e on clearance sale .
BERTIE: You 're willing to go along with this ? ! Changing horses in mid-stream is a perilous maneuver ! ! !
WINSTON CHURCHILL: Depends how badly the horse you 're on stumbles .
BERTIE: It 's not too late , Winston , you could form a government on his behalf .
WINSTON CHURCHILL: I must decline . Reluctantly .
BERTIE: I do n't want to hear it ! Ever !
WINSTON CHURCHILL: It does have a rather nice turn of phrase .
MARGARET ROSE: Daddy , who broke our rocking horse ?
BERTIE: A giant . Elizabeth holds a finger to her lips shush .
LIONEL: I too `` married the woman I love . ''
MYRTLE: You married a shop girl .
LIONEL: A wonderful lass . Someone I can talk to heart to heart .
MYRTLE: Using simple words and short sentences . I 'm very ordinary .
LIONEL: That 's why we 're suited . I 'm just an ordinary bloke .
MYRTLE: Ordinary ? You 're a man with wild dreams , Lionel . Mine are so very small . A job , a husband , a home . Raising our sons . That 's all I ever wanted .
LIONEL: Me too .
MYRTLE: Is that why , every day , you 've spent hours with a man who 's about to be King ?
LIONEL: That relationship is now past tense .
MYRTLE: Yet , for as long as you could , you did what you wanted .
LIONEL: I wanted to be a great actor . That 's what I wanted .
MYRTLE: And failing that
LIONEL: I certainly failed !
MYRTLE: A great healer . Always'great ' . Where does a shop girl fit in ?
LIONEL: Very snugly , into my heart ! Always have , always will .
MYRTLE: Trouble is , Lionel , when you say that , I still believe it .
BERTIE: Where 's the Austin ?
DRIVER: The Palace changed it , Your Highness .
BERTIE: I liked the Austin .
DRIVER: So did I , sir .
MARGARET ROSE: You look like a chicken .
LILIBET: A rooster . He waves , and gets in .
BERTIE: How did this happen to you ?
ELIZABETH: How could you possibly ?
BERTIE: Being what we both dread most .
ELIZABETH: Dear , dear , man , I refused your first two marriage proposals because , as much as I loved you , I could n't abide the thought of living in the Royal gilded cage . Then I ealizedyou stuttered so eautifullythey 'd leave you alone . She takes his face in her hands tenderly .
ANNA: `` Had I the heavens ' embroidered cloths Enwrought with golden and silver light , The `` Gets stuck .
LIONEL: We have n't much more time together . Give it a go . The doorbell RINGS . Logue is annoyed .
ANNA: `` The blue and the dim and the dark cloths Of night and light and the half-light ''
LIONEL: Read it to him . If he does n't profess his love , he 's not a man . Anna nods earnestly .
ANNA: Thank youLionel .
BERTIE: That was lovely . Do n't take any guff .
ANNA: Can I tell my Harold that 's what you said ?
BERTIE: I 'd be honoured . She dashes off .
LIONEL: Johnson , is n't it ? Have you an appointment ?
BERTIE: Want me to beg ?
LIONEL: I told you , Kings do n't beg .
BERTIE: I believe this time a bit of begging might e required . Elizabeth says I must eat humble crow .
LIONEL: Its `` crow '' or `` humble pie '' . Take your pick .
BERTIE: I was frightened and took refuge in being ` Royal ' . What I said was unforgivable . And
LIONEL: And ?
BERTIE: What 's the one essential thing a King must do ? He must believe he is King . How can I possibly do that ? For pity sake , Lionel , I eg you get me through ! I 'll pay you another shilling .
LIONEL: What 're friends for ? Logue steps aside , letting Bertie in .
BERTIE: I would n't know .
MYRTLE: I 've got the boys sorting their things . Your office will be a chore
COSMO LANG: We asked to see Your Highness because there 's the urgent question of what to call your brother . Aside from the obvious .
BERTIE: What do you suggest ?
COSMO LANG: Mr. Edward Windsor ? All he deserves .
BERTIE: What has my brother given up on his abdication , other than the throne ? They look at each other , unsure .
WINSTON CHURCHILL: Very well , Lord E.W . it is .
BERTIE: And as a Lord of the realm , he 's entitled to be elected to the House of Commons . Heading a King 's Party .
COSMO LANG: Unacceptable !
BERTIE: So you prefer he takes a seat in the House of Lords ? Again , on behalf of a King 's Party ? Is that acceptable ?
WINSTON CHURCHILL: Certainly not .
BERTIE: But if he 's made a Royal Duke , and called His Royal Highness , he can not stand fo Parliament . Nor may he speak or vote in the House of Lords .
COSMO LANG: Oh I say
BERTIE: The Duke of Windsor it is . Gentlemen . He exits abruptly .
WINSTON CHURCHILL: Not exactly a dummy , is he ?
LIONEL: Splendid . Here 's another . `` She sifted seven thick-stalked thistles through strong thick sieves . '' At home , twenty-five times , in apid succession .
BERTIE: Those are my hardest sounds . Lionel gives him a look .
LIONEL: Shall we invite your wife in now ?
MYRTLE: Milady ?
ELIZABETH: `` Your Majesty '' , the first time . After that , `` Ma'am '' . Not Malm as in Palm , Mam as in ham . I 'm informed your husband calls my husband Bertie and my husband calls you husband Lionel . I trust , however , you wo n't attempt to call me Liz .
BERTIE: How 're they getting on ?
LIONEL: As to be expected . IN THE PARLOUR Myrtle announces
MYRTLE: You may call me `` Madam Logue '' .
ELIZABETH: Thank you , Madame Logue , but I 'm waiting to e summoned . Silence .
MYRTLE: You do n't like my husband . That 's what I was told .
ELIZABETH: I was told the same .
BERTIE: Do we remain in hiding ?
LIONEL: I 'm not going out there !
MYRTLE: What do you dislike about my Lionel ?
ELIZABETH: I do n't wish my husband to be demeaned . What do n't you like about mine ?
MYRTLE: I do n't want my Lionel getting hurt .
ELIZABETH: There 's only one thing can save him now success .
BERTIE: We 're being cowards .
LIONEL: Of course . We 're sensible men .
BERTIE: You should go in .
LIONEL: Me ? You .
BERTIE: Why me ? !
LIONEL: You 're the Royal .
BERTIE: Being a monarchist , I recognize these are your digs . Therefore here you rule . Therefore you go in . Urged by Bertie , Logue opens the door .
LIONEL: Oh ! Hello , Lady Elizabeth ! Oh ! Hello , Myrtle darling ! What a pleasant surprise . Myrtle stares at him and takes her revenge .
MYRTLE: Will the Yorks be staying for dinner ?
ELIZABETH: A previous engagement .
LIONEL: Some other time , love .
ELIZABETH: Harley Street is far too public . What is my function here ?
LIONEL: For me to show you how to pitch in .
ELIZABETH: Oh dear , I may not be a ` pitch in ' type .
LIONEL: Piece of cake . Please assume a supine position on the floor .
ELIZABETH: What ? !
LIONEL: Firm support is needed .
BERTIE: Full of hot air .
LIONEL: Well on your way to becoming a qualified political speaker . Again Bertie inhales deeply .
ELIZABETH: Good grief .
LIONEL: Gently of course .
ELIZABETH: Are you alright , Bertie ? Bertie nods .
LIONEL: Now exhale slowlydown goes Princess Elizabethinhale slowlynothing rushed , expanding your chest fully , extending the column of air til it hits the diaphragmandup comes Princess Elizabeth . Exhaledown goes Princess Elizabethinhaleup comes Princess Elizabeth . You get the idea . Does n't have to be Princess Elizabeth of course , but I thought you 'd prefer your wife to one of the staff . Now comes the fun part .
ELIZABETH: There 's actually more ?
LIONEL: You will now shout the vowel sounds , all five of them , as loudly as possible , each to last no less than 15 seconds . There 's poor coordination between your larynx and diaphragm . Princess Elizabeth , you can be the official timer .
ELIZABETH: Vowel sounds ? Shouted at an open window ? On a public street ?
LIONEL: Anyone who can stand at an open window vibrating loudly in full view of the world can learn to give a public speech .
ELIZABETH: They can also be considered quite dotty . Do n't even contemplate it !
BERTIE: Sorry , dear , doctor 's orders . Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa She 's right , those two chaps are staring at me .
ELIZABETH: They 're always looking at you .
LIONEL: You 're followed ?
ELIZABETH: Royal scrutiny , Doctor , best get used to it .
BERTIE: aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaayyyyyyyyyyy eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee Are you timing this ? iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii ooooooooooooooooooooooooo uuuuuuuuuuu .
VALENTINE: May we be excused ?
LIONEL: No . The unhappy meal continues .
PETER: We do n't want to hear you fight .
LIONEL: We 're not fighting . Your mother is n't talking .
MYRTLE: You wish me to speak my mind ?
LIONEL: Boys , leave .
THE BOYS: Thank you , Dad ! Thank you , Mum ! They exit hurriedly .
MYRTLE: Lionelwithout warning , I arrive home to find the Queen in my parlour .
LIONEL: A Duchess , she has n't been crowned yet .
MYRTLE: Lionel , do n't quibble !
LIONEL: What 'd you think of her ?
MYRTLE: Does it matter ! ? She 's the Queen and he 's the King forgodsake ! What 're they doing here ? !
LIONEL: Why 'd you come home so early ?
MYRTLE: Lionel
LIONEL: They came for help .
MYRTLE: What role are you auditioning for now ? Royal saviour ? ! Who 's going to help us ? ! This will bring us down , Lionel . You know it will .
LIONEL: When that poor chap first walked into my office , he was a slim , quiet man with tired eyes and all the outward symptoms of the person upon whom a habitual speech defect has set the sign . You saw him today ; once more there was hope .
MYRTLE: You 're not listening to me !
LIONEL: Myrtle , I love you .
MYRTLE: You say that , but you do n't listen when I say , in so many ways , how desperately I want to go home , how I never , ever , intended to stay here . This was to be a holiday trip to see ` Mother England ' , and you turned it into quite something else . What happened , Lionel ? We went to Wembley Stadium , next thingyou 'd cashed in ou tickets . He 's silent .
LIONEL: Myrtle I do n't deserve a wonderful woman like you .
MYRTLE: How right you are .
LIONEL: But why 'd you come home so early ?
MYRTLE: LionelI was let go .
LIONEL: Why ? !
MYRTLE: They 're frightened , Lionel . Of what seems so far above them . I sympathize . I 'm frightened too .
LIONEL: Oh , Myrtle . My love
WINSTON CHURCHILL: Only the vulgar ones .
COSMO LANG: Let 's sincerely hope . They look at each other in silence .
WINSTON CHURCHILL: Is this a ` slightly pregnant pause ' ?
COSMO LANG: They say he is dim .
WINSTON CHURCHILL: Demonstrably untrue .
COSMO LANG: They say he has epilepsy .
WINSTON CHURCHILL: Patently erroneous .
COSMO LANG: Fragile , prone to illness
WINSTON CHURCHILL: Some correctness in that .
COSMO LANG: and will die prematurely . They predict he 'll be unable to complete the Coronation .
WINSTON CHURCHILL: What do you propose ? Shorten the ceremony ? Or no ceremony at all ?
COSMO LANG: My idea exactly !
WINSTON CHURCHILL: I believed so . But what we need is a pageant of pomp and pomposity to impress the world .
COSMO LANG: What we need , and what we 'll get , may be two rather different things . Did you hea his pathetic attempt at the Accession Council ? He 'll never be able to speak in public .
WINSTON CHURCHILL: So , we plonk a tinsel crown on his head and lock him in a closet ? Who then will spiritually lead this great nation into war ? Who will address the far flung corners of the Empire , rallying all to our defense ?
COSMO LANG: Well
WINSTON CHURCHILL: The Head of our Church ? Is that what you have in mind ?
COSMO LANG: Would it be such a calamity ?
WINSTON CHURCHILL: Best ask our new King .
COSMO LANG: Your Majesty .
WINSTON CHURCHILL: Excuse me , sir , duty calls .
BERTIE: Is this the scene of the crime ?
COSMO LANG: What a peculiar thing to say .
BERTIE: Referring to my assault upon the ears of the listeners .
COSMO LANG: Ah , yes , wireless is indeed a Pandora 's Box . I have , however , categorically said no to the BBC 's new `` radio-with-pictures '' gadget . Imagine , the unwashed viewing us as we blow our noses or scratch our bottoms .
BERTIE: Radio with pictures ? !
COSMO LANG: It is called '' television '' . Happily , with a transmission range of only fifteen miles this `` TV '' thing has no future . We shall , however , be forced to permit cinema ; the product of which I shall personally edit .
BERTIE: That 'll keep you busy , removing all my stops and starts .
COSMO LANG: Unless of course you 'd prefer a quiet ceremony ?
BERTIE: What exactly do you mean ?
COSMO LANG: Somethingdiscreetprivate . We could pre-record an edited version to be oadcast to the world . Or even find an actor with a similar voice .
LIONEL: A King based upon deception ? Cosmo takes Bertie aside .
COSMO LANG: If your gentleman from Security would give us space , we could discuss this in private .
BERTIE: You mean my bodyguard , '' Crusher ? ''
COSMO LANG: Fret not . As I assured our nation in my ecent broadcast `` When his people listen to their new Monarch they will note an occasional momentary hesitation in his speech . But to those who hear it , it need cause no sort of embarrassment , for it causes none to him who speaks . '' You see , I 've paved the way . But should you wish to avoid further stress
LIONEL: Why not paint him pink and cover him with sequins ?
COSMO LANG: Pardon ? !
LIONEL: If you wish to call attention to his anxiety .
COSMO LANG: Does your bodyguard know to whom he 's speaking ? He certainly does n't know his place !
BERTIE: Doctor Lionel Logue , my speech therapist .
COSMO LANG: Therapist ? ! I 'd no idea ! Had I known You Majesty was seeking assistance I would 've made my own recommendation .
BERTIE: Dr. Logue is to be present at the Coronation .
COSMO LANG: Impossibly to find room . Even for a Doctor .
LIONEL: Just Lionel .
BERTIE: Behind the chair of Edward the Confessor .
COSMO LANG: The Royal Box ! ? Your Family will be seated there .
BERTIE: Which makes it most suitable .
COSMO LANG: Perhaps I might be able to add a very small stool .
BERTIE: Two comfortable chairs . One for Madam Logue . She 's a close friend of my wife . The Queen .
COSMO LANG: I 'll have someone attend to it .
LIONEL: And now , if you do n't mind , we need the premises .
COSMO LANG: My dear fellow , this is Westminster Abbey ! The Church must make preparations .
LIONEL: So must Bertie .
COSMO LANG: Bertie ? ! We do not call the King `` Bertie '' !
LIONEL: I do . During waking hours we 'll need the facilities . It 'll be a closed set . No observers .
BERTIE: Those are my wishes , Your Grace . Lang nods curtly and exits .
LIONEL: Would n't want him as a friend .
BERTIE: And do n't ever call me Bertie in public .
LIONEL: Tell me
BERTIE: I sense one of your dreadful questions on the horizon .
LIONEL: Do you really want to be King ?
BERTIE: Knew it ! I have n't any choice .
LIONEL: You can be a wounded King who stumbles through his Coronation . Or , as the Arch of C so archly suggests , no Coronation at all . Always a choice .
BERTIE: What 's this , you wait til Westminste Abbey , then ambush me ?
LIONEL: I 'm simply asking questions which you seem unable to answer .
BERTIE: I 'm a sacrificial lamb being led to slaughter ! Damn you !
LIONEL: Quite possibly . But at least I know what I want . You have n't the foggiest .
LIONEL: That 's quite different . Let 's get down to work then , shall we ? Bertie glares at him .
BERTIE: George .
LIONEL: Like your father ?
BERTIE: Like my father .
LIONEL: Not Albert ?
BERTIE: Given the current situationtoo Germanic .
LIONEL: `` Sirs , I here present unto you , GEORGE , your undoubted King ! ''
COSMO LANG: I 've made inquiries .
MYRTLE: A bit dry . Tried to keep it warm .
LIONEL: Mmm Kedgeree ! Lovely .
MYRTLE: You look done in .
LIONEL: I 've news for you . You 're coming to the Coronation .
MYRTLE: I 've news for you . I 'm not !
LIONEL: You must .
MYRTLE: Stand in the rain hoping for a glimpse ?
LIONEL: Royal Box . You and I . Stunned silence , then .
MYRTLE: LionelI 'd need a new dress .
LIONEL: Rather thought you might . Valentine calls from the next room
COSMO LANG: `` The play 's the thing , wherein I 'll catch the conscience of a King . '' He exits . THE CAMERA explores various elements The Throne of Edward the Confessor .
LIONEL: Bertie ? Blast ! Stepped on Lord Byron . Bertie ?
BERTIE: This is not a rehearsal , `` Doctor '' Logue .
LIONEL: Ah , the Star Chamber inquisition . I wondered when that would happen . And I 'd promised Myrtle a new frock .
BERTIE: `` Just call me Lionel '' ! Never did you call yourself ` Doctor ' . We did that for you . No diploma , no training , no credentials . Just a great deal of nerve .
LIONEL: Want to hear my side of the story ?
BERTIE: There is n't a `` your-side-of-the-story '' . This is my story . And you 've ruined it ! Its not just the Coronation , terrifying enough , its the radio speech to millions afterwards , and the speech after that , and for the rest of my failed miserable life !
LIONEL: Wembley Stadium
BERTIE: You dare remind me ? !
LIONEL: I was there .
BERTIE: Then you knew from the start I was hopeless ? !
LIONEL: My son , Valentine , asked , `` Could you help that poor man ? '' I replied , `` He 's too old for me to manage a complete cure , but I could very nearly do it , I 'm sure of that . ''
BERTIE: Lying bastard !
LIONEL: I knew I could help you . You refuse to elieve ?
BERTIE: In you ? !
LIONEL: In yourself .
BERTIE: Who the hell do you think you are ? !
LIONEL: A failed actor .
BERTIE: Actor ?
LIONEL: Father wanted me to be a doctor , but I could n't cut flesh . So I worked in the mines , recited in pubs
BERTIE: An actor ? !
LIONEL: When the war came , by the time I was ready to be shipped out , the first casualties were limping home . Poor buggers , broken in one and spirit . ` Lionel , you 're good with your mouth , see if you can help these poo sods . ' The shell-shocked were the saddest . Most stuttered profoundly . Far worse than you . Muscle therapy helped somewhat , but I found I had to go deeper , as you might well imagine .
BERTIE: I know nothing of those poor men !
LIONEL: I think you do . They had cried out , and the universe had not listened . So they 'd lost faith in their voice . My job was to make them shout in righteous anger `` I have the ight to be heard ! ''
BERTIE: I suppose that helped them , did it ?
LIONEL: Make inquiries .
BERTIE: Inquiries have been made ! No credentials .
LIONEL: But a lot of success . No training was given .
BERTIE: To Harley Street ? !
LIONEL: Cashed in our return tickets . I had three months rent .
BERTIE: So you set yourself up on Harley Street as an actor ? Harley Street , do n't you know , is for doctors !
LIONEL: The plaque says , ` L. Logue . Speech Specialist ' . No mention of a medical degree . No mention of any degree . Some of the diggers I 'd helped had come to England . They made referrals . My practice flourished . My acting , however , did not .
BERTIE: Well enough to deceive me .
LIONEL: Lock me in the Tower .
BERTIE: I would if I could !
LIONEL: What crime ?
BERTIE: You 've saddled this nation in its moment of peril with a voiceless King . Destroyed the happiness of my familyall for the sake of ensnaring a star client you knew you could n't possibly assist !
LIONEL: I 'm tired .
BERTIE: You ca n't sit there !
LIONEL: Why not ? It 's a chair .
BERTIE: It 's the Chair of Edward The Confessor ! The throne upon which every King for six and a half centuries has been crowned .
LIONEL: It 's falling apart . People have carved their initials into it . Needs a stone to keep from blowing away .
BERTIE: That 's the Stone of Scone ! The Stone of Destiny that was once Jacob 's pillow .
LIONEL: You believe such ballocks I do n't care how many royal backsides have sat on it , it 's a uilding block with handles attached . You 're just like me , an actor with tawdry stage props you choose to believe are real .
BERTIE: Listen to me !
LIONEL: Listen to you ? ! By what right ?
BERTIE: Divine right , if you must ! I 'm your King ! ! !
LIONEL: Noooo you 're not ! Told me so yourself . Said you did n't want it . So why should I listen to a poor stuttering bloke who ca n't put one word after another ? Why waste my time listening to you ?
BERTIE: Because I have a right to be heard !
LIONEL: Heard as what ? !
BERTIE: A man ! I HAVE A VOICE ! ! !
LIONEL: Well thenyou 're cured .
BERTIE: Stop trying to squirm off the hook .
LIONEL: Bertie , you 'll make a bloody good king . And you know it . Bertie stares at him . A familiar voice is heard from the shadows .
VOICE: Your Majesty ? The Archbishop of Canterbury .
COSMO LANG: You 'll be relieved to learn I 've found a eplacement specialist . Impeccable credentials . There 's a long silence .
BERTIE: That wo n't be necessary .
COSMO LANG: The matter 's already been settled . For you own well-being .
BERTIE: What did you say ?
COSMO LANG: Your Majesty 's function is to consultand to be advised . You did n't consult , but you 've just been advised .
BERTIE: Now I advise you , so listen carefully . in this personal matter I will make my own decision .
COSMO LANG: May I remind you , you do not place the crown upon your own head .
BERTIE: And may I remind you , it is my head upon which the crown is placed !
COSMO LANG: This will end badly . Lang turns on his heel . Lionel ignores what has just happened .
LIONEL: In hushed tones the BBC commentator paints a picture for the world , as you stand at the altar divested of your robes . Trumpets echo through the Abbey . The incessant rain clears miraculously as a shaft of sun streams through the stained-glass window catching your golden tunic and bathing you in light like a mediaeval knight . And you are King !
WINSTON CHURCHILL: Amidst a vitrine of glittering jewels , obbing tiaras , and heaving bosoms . The footage freezes momentarily .
BERTIE: `` In this grave hour `` Sorry .
LIONEL: Try again .
BERTIE: `` In this grave hour ``
LIONEL: Turn the halts into pauses , during which you say to yourself , `` God save the King '' .
BERTIE: I say that all the time , but apparently no one 's listening .
LIONEL: Use the silence . Long pauses add solemnity to great occasions .
BERTIE: Then I 'm the solemnest king who ever lived . Lionel , I ca n't do this !
LIONEL: Take it from the top . `` In this grave hour ''
BERTIE: `` In this grave hour , p-p-perhaps ''
LIONEL: Go on
BERTIE: The letter ` P ' is always difficult .
LIONEL: Get a running start , put the words all together . ` Perhaps-the-most-fateful '
BERTIE: `` In this grave hourperhaps-the-most- fatefulin our history ''
LIONEL: Beaut .
BERTIE: `` I send to every household of my peoplesboth at home and overseas ''
LIONEL: In your head , now `` Bugger , bugger , bugger ! Damn , damn , damn ! All those bloody lighters are going to have to listen to me ! '' Can you dance ?
BERTIE: What ?
LIONEL: Helps relax the body . Waltz ?
BERTIE: I prefer pipes .
LIONEL: Thought you might . Dance with me . One , two , one-two-three- four . One , two , one- two-three-four . `` Fo the second time '' one-two-three-four `` in the lives of most of us '' one , two , one-two-three- four `` we are at war . '' Three , four .
BERTIE: `` For the second time in the lives of most of us we are at war . '' One-two- three . `` Over and over again we have tried to find a peaceful way out of the differences between ourselves and those who are now our enemies . '' Bugger , ugger , bugger ! Fuck , fuck , fuck !
LIONEL: You 'll be ready .
BERTIE: The shilling you won still have it ?
LIONEL: Of course .
BERTIE: I 'll return it .
LIONEL: Willie ! Where 's your mum ?
WILLIE: She had to work .
LIONEL: You 've been waiting here , alone , all this time ? Willie nods again . Then , haltingly
WILLIE: I heard the King .
LIONEL: Did you ?
WILLIE: He sang . And shouted rude words .
LIONEL: He did . Willie beams .
FLOOR MANAGER: Think he 'll manage ?
BERTIE: ` Walk up to the bloody thing boldly , stare it square in the eye , man to man . '
ELIZABETH: Bertie , do make sure that 's not switched on !
LIONEL: You 're going to be splendid . And if you 're not ?
BERTIE: They 'll bloody well have to listen to me anyway . Right ?
LIONEL: Bloody right .
ELIZABETH: Mr. Prime Minister , Your Grace , how kind of you to join us .
COSMO LANG: Would n't miss this for the world . Congratulations . Neville did n't last long , did he ? Talking to Hitler .
WINSTON CHURCHILL: My tenure will be shorter , if the King fails tonight . Bertie and Logue speak privately .
BERTIE: No matter how this turns out , I wish to thank you . For asking such dreadful questions . What can I do in recompense ?
LIONEL: I 've always wanted to be knighted .
BERTIE: Sorry . That would raise too many questions .
LIONEL: Understood . Bertie takes something from his pocket .
BERTIE: Your shilling . Told you I 'd give it back .
LIONEL: Keep it for good luck .
BERTIE: No , you won this , fair and square .
LIONEL: My greatest honour , Bertie . One final question .
BERTIE: Oh dear .
LIONEL: Do you believe you 're King ? A very long pause .
BERTIE: Almost .
WINSTON CHURCHILL: Could n't have said it better myself . The ultimate compliment . Lang next .
COSMO LANG: I 'm speechless .
ELIZABETH: Thank God .
LIONEL: I always called you Bertie . Today , I call you King .

MISS ROSS: Really . His happiest day ! Can you tell us about that day , Mr. Fleury ? Fleury smiles , looks out at the class .
RONALD FLEURY: I sure can . That was December 4th and that was the day that we spent the whole day in the hospital waiting for this guy right here to come out of Kevin 's mom 's tummy . And we waited and waited but he would n't come and we kept waiting and finally the doctor said ` OKhe 's not gon na come out on his own so we got to go get him . ' And well , Fleury stops , checks in with Miss Ross .
MISS ROSS: Go for it . RONALD Fleury So they take her and put her on a special bed and they give her some medicine so she does n't feel any pain then they take out this tiny little knife and make a tiny little cut right here in her tummy . The kids are mesmerized

FLEURY: Glenda , I want you to look at me .
CNN REPORTER: 1 hour ago blasts in Saudi Arabia , in or around the ` Al- Rahmah ' western housing complex near Riyadh . More than 100 feared dead , including children . The Saudi Foreign Minister has released a statement calling this a ` heinous act possibly committed by foreigners '
BBC REPORTER: homes to thousands of Westerners and other non-Saudis who work in the Kingdom , there have been several attacks on these compounds in the last five years . As such , they have become very tight in terms of security , with both the Saudi National Guard and police taking command .
RONALD FLEURY: Numbers so far 100+ dead , 200+ injured . The target was a softball game . Rumor is the Killers wore Saudi police uniforms . Special Agent Fran Manner was killed .
GRANT SYKES: From the craters , looks like they used a High Explosive possibly military grade ca n't fit that much TNT into a vest . 20 , 30 pounds of PETN they got it . Semtex or C-4 they could get it . The third there , God knowsthat crater looks like a plane dropped a 500-pounder
RONALD FLEURY: Obviously a secondary blast afte the initial devices used to lure first responders to the scene . Do n't know anything about where o what it was yet .
GRANT SYKES: This is how they do it .
RONALD FLEURY: If you already know the answe Adam , why ask the question ?
SYKES: We 're not seeing this kind of planning and execution anywhere elsethese ai n't hot-wired artillery shells waiting fo Humvees to roll by . These hits are coordinated planning , timing , and big , broad- daylight balls-
JANET MAYES: Yeah , So did they all happen during daylight ?
AGENT #1: Yes . At least the first parts of the attacks .
JANET MAYES: We had two othersNorth of Riyadh and the oil thing . What was that ?
ADAM LEAVITT: The Refinery Ras Tenura Refinery .
JANET MAYES: Yeah , south of Jeddah . Same thing daylight , suicide bombers . Right ?
ADAM LEAVITT: Yup .
RONALD FLEURY: This is not new in concept . It is new in scope . It 's bigger . Very sophisticated . Command and control was flawless . They found the largest kill zone they could and they did it they did it by being patient .
ADAM LEAVITT: Any rumors or confirmations of uniforms being used in the othe two attacks ? Fleury circles Mayes ' name on the ERT roster .
AGENT #1: No . I know this is the first fo that .
GRANT SYKES: That 's ` worst case scenario ' if you 're still asking for my stab , Sir . A crew who can build bombs this big , with this level of eyes- on control and detonation coordination has access to Saudi uniforms nowI meanBaby Jesus .
LEAVITT: Anyone take credit ? Fleury checks from his notes .
FLEURY: Abu Hamza . Saudi Al-Qaeda . Bin- Laden-wanna-be . We know he was in Afghanistan , then moved to Iraq . Now he seems to have come home . He 's clearly becoming increasingly active
ADAM LEAVITT: If it is Hamza , he 's definitely turning up the volume over there .
JANET MAYES: They ca n't afford to appear as if they are losing any kind of control . They lose control ove their country , their peoplethen they risk losing control over the oil . They wo n't let us in . No way .
RONALD FLEURY: From the State Department , one hou ago ` We are in agreement with the Saudi security assessment that any additional American presence on Kingdom soil represents reckless isk . Therefore it is the Secretary of State 's position that only afte the situation has been evaluated and contained , should the Federal Bureau of Investigation activate Rapid Deployment . ' The National Security Advisor and the Attorney General agreed . I 'm going to get us access . Keep your go bags hot . It 's gon na come fast .
ADAM LEAVITT: Well I guess he 's gon na go get us some access . How 's he gon na do that ? Sykes just hard-eyes Leavitt .
SERGEANT HAYTHAM: Killing those I saw responsible .
HAYTHAM: I love my country .
DIRECTOR GRACE: Everyone 's terrified , so nothing moves . Paralysis . You and your team are n't going anywhere . And this meeting is just a circle- jerk , Ronnie Attorney General Young 's going to go through the motions because protocol says we get an appeal . We 'll be on record , ut expect nothing more . Nothing from Fleury .
RONALD FLEURY: Yeah , sure . No problem .
DIRECTOR GRACE: What about Agent Mayes ?
RONALD FLEURY: Ask her .
DIRECTOR GRACE: What about you ?
JANET MAYES: I 'll be fine .
DIRECTOR GRACE: I apologize if we 're late-
GIDEON YOUNG: They were early .
DIRECTOR GRACE: You know Special Agent Fleury ?
GIDEON YOUNG: I do .
DIRECTOR GRACE: This is agent Janet Mayes , she 's one of our Arabic experts .
GIDEON YOUNG: OK . The latest . Grace sits , nods to Fleury you 're up
RONALD FLEURY: Two suicide bombers . Rumors they were dressed as Saudi Police . We elieve this is the work of Saudi terrorist named Abu Hamza .
GIDEON YOUNG: Go on . Fleury continues
RONALD FLEURY: A Shooter crew served as distraction . After the initial attack there was a lull to allow Saudi Emergency Teamsand our own attachesto collect . Then a secondary blast was triggered , aimed at those first responders . So they targeted families and rescuers with one attack . I think that 's a clear signal that their definition of ` Enemy ' is expanding .
MARICELLA CANAVESIO: My God .
GIDEON YOUNG: Let us never forget how cheap life is over there . NowI have seven minutes before my next meeting , so who 's talking first ? You two digested the memo ?
ELLIS LEACH: I 'll go first if that 's okay Maricella ? First , I 'm sorry about Fran Manner . Gideon Young remembers , nods along solemnly .
DIRECTOR GRACE: As we are about Rex Burr .
ELLIS LEACH: I met with Prince Thamer at the Saudi embassy fifteen minutes afte I heard this morning 's news . Afte speaking with Thamer , I advised we withhold additional US personnel ecause a big part of the religious justification for these bombs is the presence of current US personnel . More boots on Saudi soil make an already combustible situation more so . I know that 's not the answer you want , but Motions to Maricella the floor is yours .
MARICELLA CANAVESIO: My two cents The Saudis have n't asked for FBI help . Sounds like they 've done just the opposite . If we force the issue , that could further anger an utterly important ally that shares a 1000-mile long order with Iraq .
GIDEON YOUNG: It 's all rock-solid logic .
DIRECTOR GRACE: We would just like to be on record as saying we think we should go
GIDEON YOUNG: That 's not going to happen
RONALD FLEURY: Sir , how would you imagine it looks viewed through an FBI agents eyes ?
GIDEON YOUNG: Pardon me ?
RONALD FLEURY: I 'm interested in how you think this situation is viewed through our eyes .
GIDEON YOUNG: It 's some variation on vengeance When one of your own is killed , Agents lose their analytical powers - kind of a greatest strength , greatest weakness thing
RONALD FLEURY: If I wanted vengeance , I 'd have whispered ` Rex Burr ' into Ellis 's ear right when we walked in . Eyes migrate to Fleury
MARICELLA CANAVESIO: What 's the distinction ?
RONALD FLEURY: To call this massacre an act of terrorism that implies a specific political agenda . To me , these killings are so futile and unbalanced that they feel utterly sociopathic- more like Charles Manson than Osama Bin Laden
JANET MAYES: Al Qaeda lost the first phase of this war , so a new , zero-sum phase has begun if you wo n't join us , we 'll let loose the truly talented Murderers Abu Hamza . He will kill so many of you that the esulting humiliation of the Saudi Royal Family will cause an exodus , a rebellion , both . Because the Royal Family simply can not protect you or yours any longer .
RONALD FLEURY: When she says talented , she 's not talking about the walking-bombs who can sneak past any and all security , nor the hi-jackers tough enough to take an airliner . We 're talking about the Man who teaches them how
JANET MAYES: the operational commander who organizes , trains , plans , encourages . That is who we 're fighting .
RONALD FLEURY: If we do n't get inside Saudi Arabia within 36 hours , there is no chance we catch the killer responsible fo Al-Rahmah . None .
ELLIS LEACH: Okay . I believe it all . So does n't your team in that country represent the kind of target one of these ` Masters ' would die for ? Trade ten of their own for one of you ?
RONALD FLEURY: To not engage these criminals out of fear for our personal safety is just another way of saying ` uncle . ' Fleury takes another deep breath .
GIDEON YOUNG: That was spirited let 's all thank God Special Agent Fleury does n't make policy decisions . He 'd turn the FBI into Patton 's Third Army .
DIRECTOR GRACE: I see the look in your eyes . That look is trouble old school , play ground shit , vengeance
RONALD FLEURY: It 's not vengeance .
DIRECTOR GRACE: It ai n't justice . It 's stronger . We 've all been there . I have . Vengeance is always dirty , Ronnie .
RONALD FLEURY: I just ca n't sit this out . I ca n't watch this not get dealt with . Not again . Know what my high school football coach used to say to me ?
DIRECTOR GRACE: What ?
RONALD FLEURY: `` HIT SOMETHING . '' All night long , Coach Bailey would scream `` HIT SOMETHING . '' Every play .
DIRECTOR GRACE: That 's good coaching .
RONALD FLEURY: I 'm fixing to go hit something , oss . You with me ?
DIRECTOR GRACE: How you gon na do it ?
RONALD FLEURY: The Saudis covet good PR as much as their Oil 15 of 19 hijackers on 9- 11 means most Americans will neve stop asking if that Saudi Oil is worth it . It 's all about press .
DIRECTOR GRACE: Few more moves and it 's Total War , Ronnie . The only time Treason is palatable is when it 's done ighteously and completely
JANET MAYES: Oh , I 'm inNot a question . I 'm definitely going .
RONALD FLEURY: What 's your take ?
ELAINE FLOWERS: Looks like every overthrow in history once the guys with the guns are no longer trustworthy , the government 's days are numbered .
RONALD FLEURY: White House call you with a spin ?
ELAINE FLOWERS: You kidding ? We do n't talk since I oke the Vice President 's guy cooking dirty intel on Iran . They hate me . What 's up , Fleury ?
RONALD FLEURY: How hard you gon na hit the Royal Family in your column tomorrow ?
ELAINE FLOWERS: With a sledgehammer .
RONALD FLEURY: With the bombings ? Or othe things
ELAINE FLOWERS: What 's `` other '' than the bombings ?
RONALD FLEURY: I know you 're tracking Al Haramain .
ELAINE FLOWERS: Is that what you want to talk about ? Saudi officials making donations that end up What ? Blowing up trains in Paris ? Buses in London ?
RONALD FLEURY: Sometimes . Seems that just might happen .
ELAINE FLOWERS: MurderHookersHouston ? Can I take some notes ?
RONALD FLEURY: I 'm not saying that .
ELAINE FLOWERS: Are you saying anything ?
RONALD FLEURY: I need a favor .
ELAINE FLOWERS: I do n't do favors , Ronnie .
RONALD FLEURY: When it 's real and it will be eal I 'll come to you with what we have first . It 's yours . Exclusive .
ELAINE FLOWERS: OK .
RONALD FLEURY: You call Thamer at the Embassy . Tell him that the FBI is getting eal close to laying out some majo Saudi VIP indictments relating to newly uncovered charity financing out of a Boston investment firm . We 're gon na freeze a lot of Saudi cash and roll out some majo embarrassment .
ELAINE FLOWERS: Can I mention Houston ?
RONALD FLEURY: It 's a free world , baby . Ask him to comment .
ELAINE FLOWERS: He wo n't .
RONALD FLEURY: Tell him that I 'm running the investigation .
ELAINE FLOWERS: OK .
RONALD FLEURY: Tell him that I 'm not the nicest kid on the block .
ELAINE FLOWERS: That would be accurate .
RONALD FLEURY: I want fifteen minutes with him tonight .
ELAINE FLOWERS: Wow . OK. And I get what ?
RONALD FLEURY: I come to you first . No one else .
ELAINE FLOWERS: What 's really going on here , Ronnie ? You going strong over Fran Manner ? Fleury just stares at her .
RONALD FLEURY: I 'm just trying to do my job , Elaine . That 's it . Call Thamer .
ELAINE FLOWERS: I 'll see what I can do .
RONALD FLEURY: Get back in .
PRINCE THAMER: I had an interesting conversation with a reporter from the Post .
RONALD FLEURY: She can be a bit of an exaggerator I 'm sure things were somewhat over-stated . I see myself as friend of Saudi Arabia . I just need a little cooperation , that 's all .
PRINCE THAMER: What kind of cooperation ? ?
RONALD FLEURY: Full cooperation my Team cleared to land at Prince Sultan Air Base . Tomorrow . We want to help in a very muscular way , quickly .
PRINCE THAMER: Next month would be as soon as Fleury takes a beat .
RONALD FLEURY: This goes one of two ways . First The FBI with the White House go on the kind of aggressive PR `` Saudi Royal Family Decaying Monarchy '' ender that just ca n't help but hurt . Really hurt . And I do n't care how many Chinese are lined up to uy the oil . You know it 's gon na hurt .
PRINCE THAMER: My family is not decaying-
RONALD FLEURY: And then we bring the hammer down hard as hell Bust Al Haramain - we got direct links from Riyadh - two wives donating ten million to three Arab-American cultural centers in Boston . Then what gets kind of not- funny is how some of that cash found its way to Jakarta and some Mosques that have these training camps built right next to them . It 's kinda funny you got little kids playing over here , and some not so little kids playing with guns over here . That 's kinda odd .
PRINCE THAMER: You have no proof of this .
RONALD FLEURY: We 're getting there , Sir . And I have n't even brought up the two girls still missing out of Houston . This is big . It is real . And I know you only care so much about public American opinion , Sir . But the story will be covered Big
PRINCE THAMER: What is your point ? Fleury looks back to him .
RONALD FLEURY: Last I heard , 112 people lost thei lives in your country . One of them was a good friend of mine . I want in and I want in immediately . That 's a rock solid answer .
PRINCE THAMER: Define `` immediately . ''
RONALD FLEURY: Right now immediately .
FLEURY: If your phone does n't work international , you can borrow mine .
PRINCE THAMER: We can not allow 100 agents-
RONALD FLEURY: -4 . With a 25-man security detail-
PRINCE THAMER: -even 25 more armed Americans could spark rebellion-
RONALD FLEURY: That 's too bad .
PRINCE THAMER: Saudi Security . That 's non negotiable . You can not bring guns into the Kingdom .
RONALD FLEURY: Men in Saudi Police uniforms are why we 're talking now .
PRINCE THAMER: They would be hand picked .
RONALD FLEURY: Whose hands ?
PRINCE THAMER: Mine . Fleury blinks .
FLEURY: If anything happens to me or my team It 's on you . Understood ?
PRINCE THAMER: Cool it with the John Wayne , Mr. Fleury . Fleury just stares .
RONALD FLEURY: -seven-day or work-week ?
PRINCE THAMER: Work week . Five days . No guns . Hands shake .
HAYTHAM'S FATHER: What happened ?
SERGEANT HAYTHAM: You have n't heard about the attack ?
HAYTHAM'S FATHER: I choose not to listen anymore . What happened to your face ?
SERGEANT HAYTHAM: An attack today .
HAYTHAM'S FATHER: Look at me .
ADAM LEAVITT: What was Fran Manner to her ?
GRANT SYKES: He taught her how to shoot , she taught him most everything else . Celebrated graduation at the IHOP in-town until some Townie called Janet somethingSomething not very nice . Townie did n't see Fran coming outta the Head . But he definitely felt Fran 's uppercut shatter his jaw .
ADAM LEAVITT: Fran did n't get bounced for that ? Points to Fleury 's dirty Jeep arriving .
GRANT SYKES: SAC Fleury took care of him .
ADAM LEAVITT: How ?
GRANT SYKES: If I knew how I 'd be SAC Sykes . I do know the post in Riyadh was part of the deal Fleury cut to save Fran 's career .
ADAM LEAVITT: What did SAC Fleury whisper in you ear this morning ?
JANET MAYES: ` Grant 's age is a liability . '
FLEURY: Thanks for volunteering .
LEAVITT: Actually , I did n't volunteer .
FLEURY: Thanks anyway .
LEAVITT: We 're going to Riyadh ?
FLEURY: Yup .
SYKES: State department said yes ?
FLEURY: Nope .
LEAVITT: White House said yes ?
FLEURY: Nope .
LEAVITT: Anybody said yes ?
FLEURY: Not really .
LEAVITT: Are we bringing security ?
FLEURY: Nope .
LEAVITT: This is going to suck so bad .
ADAM LEAVITT: What can four people do in five days ? Really ?
GRANT SYKES: Are n't you the one who demanded to go this morning ?
ADAM LEAVITT: I meant the FBI . I did n't mean `` me . ''
GRANT SYKES: Mars .
JANET MAYES: I 'll be looked at with what I can only describe as disdain , pretty much the entire time we 're on the ground kind of like South Virginia .
GRANT SYKES: Go easy on my kin .
JANET MAYES: It 's a very confused culture . Extremely religious . Had nothing ; wanted nothing . Sixty years ago , they hit oil . Simple religious men ecome trillionaires a schizophrenic nation is born . The oyal family , who we back , and everyone else . Intercut with the Scrabble .
GRANT SYKES: What 's going on in there ?
RONALD FLEURY: I 'm good . Sykes puts his hand on Fleury 's chest .
GRANT SYKES: Feels like you got a beast in there , Fleury .
RONALD FLEURY: I 'm good
GRANT SYKES: `` Good '' is 6 00 am Sunday morning when your kid climbs into your bed , uries himself into you sun 's creeping through the windows - soft . Birds and wind-chimes that 's `` good . '' A BEAT as Fleury looks at Sykes .
RONALD FLEURY: I 'm OKYou do n't think I 'm OK ?
GRANT SYKES: I think you 're not entirely clea ight now . That 's OK , but you got to know that . You want to go - we go . I got you , but you got to check yourself .
RONALD FLEURY: I 'm checked .
GRANT SYKES: OK . I 'm just checking that you checked . Fleury stands up .
RONALD FLEURY: How we doing ?
PILOT #1: About a half hour out .
RONALD FLEURY: They gon na let us land ?
PILOT #1: We 've been talking to them about an hour or so they know we 're coming .
RONALD FLEURY: Good .
PILOT #1: You do n't mind my asking , but what the hell you all gon na be doing down there ?
RONALD FLEURY: Hunting
PILOT #1: Hunting ? I think of hunting , I think quail in Tennessee , deer in Pennsylvania . What kind of hunting you all gon na do in Saudi ?
RONALD FLEURY: Big Game hunting .
JANET MAYES: We brought our own .
ADAM LEAVITT: Israeli stamp in my passport ?
GRANT SYKES: And I usually just toss it on the kitchen table
JANET MAYES: Would n't need the power a ' praye if there were 2 hands on the wheel .
ADAM LEAVIIT: 110 miles per hour How do you keep so calm ? I mean , really ? Is it breathing
JANET MAYES: Shhhh .
RONALD FLEURY: If somebody was tailing us it 'd be obvious . This is just standard operating speed .
RONALD FLEURY: You do n't know what you missed you should have seen him play fo our Chicago Bulls .
GRANT SYKES: You have portable lights on-scene ?
ADAM LEAVITT: I do n't like camels .
RONALD FLEURY: Colonel , do you believe Abu Hamza was responsible for this attack ?
GRANT SYKES: You interviewed witnesses ?
RONALD FLEURY: You do n't know the source of the last , do n't know if your own Officers were involved , but you wo n't let us work nights ?
DIRECTOR GRACE: Good afternoon , Sir .
GIDEON YOUNG: ` Sunlight is indeed the most powerful disinfectant .
DIRECTOR GRACE: Senators ? Then I 'd change ` outmoded ' to ` outdated , ' ` echelons ' to ` ranks ' and what in God 's name is ` contretemps ? ' These guys are n't the best and brightest- Young 's face flashes red , seething
GIDEON YOUNG: -never take the Lord 's name in vain in this office-
DIRECTOR GRACE: -but you can say ` Fucking ? '
GIDEON YOUNG: -you really want to bet ?
DIRECTOR GRACE: I do .
JANET MAYES: That 's one of the great horrors of television Crime scene manipulation . They say a TV camera adds pounds to actresses . Is n't that what they say ?
ADAM LEAVITT: Who 's `` they ? ''
JANET MAYES: That is what they say . Does n't add to crime scenes . Television cameras shrink them . Misrepresent . No smells . Poor sound . Limited view . TV always makes them look smaller . You ca n't feel the hatred on television .
FLEURY: heads on a swivel , people .
JANET MAYES: EASY .
FLEURY: What time tomorrow morning ?
RONALD FLEURY: What time is sunrise ?
GRANT SYKES: That 's against fire code .
JANET MAYES: They do n't have fire codes . They do n't have codes other than codes of war . They 'll lock us in and dial up some kind of earth movers if they want to . You know that , Sykes . Dig a big hole and push us in . Fill it up and no one comes calling . You 're in the jungle now , baby .
ADAM LEAVITT: You alright , girl ?
JANET MAYES: Watch it , boy .
ADAM LEAVITT: Just asking
JANET MAYES: Unpack .
FLEURY: Saudi slow roll
LYLA FLEURY: Hello ?
RONALD FLEURY: Hey How are you ? How 's my boy ?
LYLA FLEURY: We 're just fine . How are you ? Where are you ?
RONALD FLEURY: I 'm here Lem me talk to my boy . A BEAT as Lyla passes the phone to Kevin .
FLEURY: What you doing ?
PAUSE: I saw him .
FLEURY: Yeah Yeahhe 's still tall .
SCHMIDT: You are in so much trouble .
FLEURY: Is that right ?
SCHMIDT: For sure . I mean , I do n't know how you did it . Nice work , but if you live through this , which I put at about fifty percent - if you do , your balls are gon na get stretched and beaten on . Dig that ?
GRANT SYKES: Slow roll gon na be like when you go deep sea fishing in Florida and you pay seven hundred bucks for the oat and you sit in the ocean fo hours and the crew jumps around and screams and points and you think your constantly about to bag a Marlin but you never do and they keep pointing and jumping and-
FLEURY: Enough .
POLICE OFFICER: You 're willing to die to protect your enemy ?
RONALD FLEURY: What did the Prince say ?
ADAM LEAVITT: How could they get more secure ?
SYKES: Well , this is going well
FLEURY: Saudi Slow Roll .
JANET MAYES: Good .
LEAVITT: How do you do that ? Janet gently bounce-passes it back
JANET MAYES: Check .
LEAVITT: Do n't say ` good ' again .
JANET: Bueno .
FLEURY: Of course we wo n't .
SYKES: I think it 's one of those `` something happens to us his head comes off '' kind of deals . Is it one of those kind of deals , Colonel ? Al-Ghazi ignores Sykes .
FLEURY: So , if you 're not running the investigationwho is ?
ADAM LEAVITT: I thought the SANG were soldiers
RONALD FLEURY: Who is in charge of the investigation then ?
FLEURY: I 'm guessing there are a bunch of Americans , Brits Australians ? Someone must have seen something . I 'm sure they 're just dying to talk to you guys , seeing as how the killers were wearing your uniforms . That must be a real confidence ooster for them . Al-Ghazi silent , staring .
EARL: There 's still a couple of hundred of us living on the compound .
RONALD FLEURY: Why Saudi Arabia ?
EARL: Neither of us did anymore schooling than Electra High , Electra Texas .
RONALD FLEURY: OK .
EARL: And the jobs here pay twice what you 'd make in Midland or the Gulf a ' Mexico . Plus the house is free .
JANINE RIPON: I call it combat pay . This place has gone Guns - Guns - Guns .
RONALD FLEURY: So has Everyone else now .
JANINE: My girlfriends in Texas spend thei combat pay on diamonds I spent mine on a safe room .
RONALD FLEURY: Two nights back . Can you start one second before you knew anything was wrong ?
JANINE: We did n't really see anything . Just hit the ground and hustled to the safe room . Closed our eyes and prayed . It was so fast . So loud .
RONALD FLEURY: So you really did n't see anything .
MADDY: I hit the deck . Horrible .
JANINE: Not ` til after . Just the screams
EARL: the kids they were screaming . That got me out of the house . Those kids .
FLEURY: Which kids were those ?
JANINE: The Jackson kids . Tracy Jackson next door was murdered looking out her windowfront of her children . No safe room over there Not even the Men that did this should die in front a ' thei abies .
RONALD FLEURY: She live with her husband ?
EARL: Aaron .
RONALD FLEURY: If I 'm facing your house , is the Jackson home to the right or left ?
JANINE: Left .
RONALD FLEURY: Mr. Aaron Jackson ?
AARON JACKSON: Get him away from me-
RONALD FLEURY: -easy , Sir . He 's a friend to us-
AARON JACKSON: -I do n't know either one a ' you .
RONALD FLEURY: I 'm Special Agent Ronald Fleury of the FBI . This is Colonel Al-Ghazi with the Saudi State Police-
AARON JACKSON: -the Police they attacked .
RONALD FLEURY: Can I come back ?
RONALD FLEURY: Your boys
AARON JACKSON: When my wife 's jaw was shot off in front of our sons ? My sons who sat with her while she bled to death ? Could n't speak because she did n't have the bottom of her face and I was n't home and my baby boys are destroyed for life and my five year- old had a box of band-aids in his hand when I finally got home ?
RONALD FLEURY: I wo n't pretend to know
AARON JACKSON: Kill everyone that had something to do with this . Everyone related to them . Everyone who knew them . And all you 'd be doing is thei ecruiting for them It 's an entire generation not small and isolated like they say . But a generation that thinks what they did to my wife , to my children , is a `` calling ''
RONALD FLEURY: Up the street , there was a wreck , did you see any-
AARON JACKSON: -notice how it would n't take a lot to disguise your friend as a Mexican ? Think he could n't handle crossing our deserts ? Look around !
RONALD FLEURY: Aaron-
RONALD FLEURY: Can we tour the compound ? Can we please do that ? Slow nod from Al-Ghazi .
JANET MAYES: He or she almost made it .
FLEURY: That 's what makes this a War .
ADAM LEAVITT: Hit a water main ?
GRANT SYKES: Hole is the case . See , there 's `` evidence '' down in that hole . You understand evidence ? Little things that are `` clues . '' Clues can be very helpful to a fella when he 's trying to solve a crime .
ADAM LEAVITT: A little high
FLEURY: Watt-tee
ADAM LEAVITT: Watt-tee fuck is his gun doing up so high ?
SERGEANT HAYTHAM: -dead . So Sergeant Haytham speaks English
FLEURY: Were any of these shooters you men ?
SERGEANT HAYTHAM: No .
FLEURY: They got into the compound . Somehowtook control of this vehicle . I 'm guessing they did n't politely ask whoever was in this car if they could take it for a little ride ?
SERGEANT HAYTHAM: they were . They were Police .
FLEURY: I 'm sorry .
JANET MAYES: Good news is that if he shoots you , he 's gon na shoot you sitting on an American tank with an American- made bullet . So , it 's kind of `` all in the family . ''
ADAM LEAVITT: How about we get into those American Suburbans with thei American A/C
FLEURY: The car was parked here ?
JANET MAYES: The same Mosque is enough to identify them , link them to a cell ?
ADAM LEAVITT: Suweidi ?
JANET MAYES: Suweidi is a known militant stonghold . Al-Qaeda could recruit from storefronts .
FLEURY: Can we go to check out some of these surrounding buildings ?
RONALD FLEURY: Well , in order to video , in orde to observe , you need a view . Fleury points to one particular building .
FLEURY: That building sees all three crime scenes .
ADAM LEAVITT: -c'mon now . This is insane we got enough security to invade Suweidi , let alone that building-
FLEURY: Could you ask ?
FLEURY: -time . I understand .
JANET MAYES: This is the kind of radical circumstance that could have seriously upped Shaq 's free throw percentages . Take a man . Ship him off to Riyadh . No phones , constant threat of death , no girls , no hip hop . Nothing just free throws . Shaq , he 'd be shooting at least seventy percent . Lakers would still e together . Kobe and Shaq lovers forever . Leavitt calls to Fleury .
LEAVITT: Hey , Boss check this out .
SANG OFFICER: This is unacceptable .
JANET MAYES: Tell me it did n't burst-tell me it did n't burst-
FLEURY: You 've seen the images of the attack posted on the internet ?
RONALD FLEURY: Formed the plan up here saw everything he could hit . Way too pretty a ' plan to have been fully hatched on just one visit . He came here a couple times .
FLEURY: I see .
RONALD FLEURY: Two big answers in two small minutes . Imagine if we had a couple days together . Al-Ghazi pauses .
FLEURY: You want to tell her that ?
ADAM LEAVITT: Big wall .
RONALD FLEURY: They all get palaces this big ?
ADAM LEAVITT: Who pays for all this ?
GRANT SYKES: General Motors , Ford , Chevrolet
ADAM LEAVITT: Hey , man - I drive a Hybrid .
RONALD FLEURY: I do .
GRANT SYKES: That was impressive .
RONALD FLEURY: Think it will work ?
GRANT SYKES: Yeah . Maybe . I mean , you can only play the `` I 'm going to the press card '' like three more times . So , maybe .
RONALD FLEURY: They 're paranoid and overly self- protective .
DAMON SCHMIDT: They are n't protecting anyone . There 's no conspiracy . They 're just terrified . Finally . The Saudis have finally seen the Monsters they helped create , because those Monsters have come home . And if Saudis do n't catch Saudi Monsters , that 's the end . Fleury opens his mouth to interrupt .
GRANT SYKES: That 's dead on accurate . Very impressive . That 's why they 're making it hard on us , and that 's why he wants to help ` em turn the screws .
RONALD FLEURY: They can have every shred of credit-
DAMON SCHMIDT: -you see the slums on the way in ?
RONALD FLEURY: Yeah .
DAMON SCHMIDT: See that even though their homes are falling down , they had satellite dishes bolted on ?
RONALD FLEURY: Yeah
DAMON SCHMIDT: Everyone already knows you 're here . Credit ? If the Saudis cracked this Cell while these servants were pouring coffee , Al-Jazeera still leads the story with your Team .
RONALD FLEURY: Have you been to the crime-scene ?
DAMON SCHMIDT: No-
RONALD FLEURY: -if you had , you 'd see the evil work of real Talent . The kind that does n't stop until it 's forced .
DAMON SCHMIDT: And the path to Hell is paved with good intentions .
RONALD FLEURY: You having fun ?
DAMON SCHMIDT: Beats hell outta visa-stamping .
RONALD FLEURY: By catching Abu Hamza . Raising his coffee , toasting Fleury 's cup
DAMON SCHMIDT: Then here 's to you . Let 's bet when this Colonel Al-Ghazi comes out , he 's in-charge of the investigation -if so , you set me up on a date with Janet Mayes .
RONALD FLEURY: Do me a favor and tell Janet that she and Damon Schmidt got a date when he gets back to the States . Al-Ghazi points into darkness
GRANT SYKES: Fellas , what we want to do is get this water out of here see what 's really going on . Understand ? No reaction from Saudi police
RONALD FLEURY: Have him pass these out to the compound security . See if anybody knows them .
EARL: No , Sir . Fleury pulls out the photographs .
RONALD FLEURY: Could you tell me if you recognize any of these men ?
JANINE: Horrible . A few moments , then
EARL: I do n't know any of them . Fleury thinks a minute . Looks outside .
FLEURY: I 'm just wondering . That chair out side . Looks like it gets a lot of wear . Looks comfortable .
EARL: That my mom 's chair .
FLEURY: See , that 's exactly what I was thinking . I 'm guessing she spends a lot of time sitting outside ?
EARL: All day .
FLEURY: She must pretty much see it all . Right ?
EARL: She does .
FLEURY: Where is she ?
EARL: She 's sleeping . Pause Fleury slow nods , then
FLEURY: Let 's wake her up .
MADDY: I 've seen him .
RONALD FLEURY: Where ? Maddy thinking
MADDY: Like , a week ago . Twice I 've seen him . WateringWith the garden crews . I remember he was wearing a Liza Minnelli T-shirt . I thought that was funny .
RONALD FLEURY: What about the others ?
MADDY: No . Just him . I remember the T- shirt . I remember thinking it was odd ?
RONALD FLEURY: What , the Liza Minelli shirt ?
MADDY: No . I do think Liza Minelli 's gone odd , but that was n't it .
RONALD FLEURY: What was odd ?
MADDY: He was a Saudi . The gardener .
RONALD FLEURY: Yeah .
MADDY: Saudis , like Americans , do n't do manual labor . Blowing leaves is eneath them .
RONALD FLEURY: Thank you . Fleury and Al-Ghazi start to leave .
EARL: Who is he ? Fleury looks back to Earl .
RONALD FLEURY: That 's one of the many things we 're trying to find out
AARON JACKSON: -what do you know about what my kids need ? What they saw ? What the est of their lives might be like ?
RONALD FLEURY: I thought maybe your Boyswithout their Mom anymoremight ask you why sometime
AARON JACKSON: Tomorrow it 'll be somebody else 's wife . Fleury quiet .
RONALD FLEURY: Then tomorrow I 'll come back .
SYKES: It 's a gurney . Sykes looks down at the mud colored DIGGERS .
GRANT SYKES: Here .
HAYTHAM: You can not touch any Muslims .
JANET: No problem . Can I still touch Americans ?
HAYTHAM: Of course .
FLEURY: What 's gas running a gallon out here , Al-Ghazi ? Penny gallon ? Al-Ghazi smiles .
RONALD FLEURY: A trillion reasons for our Leaders to hold hands another one hundred years .
FLEURY: Feel like I 'm back home in Detroit .
RONALD FLEURY: OK . Should n't we arrest him o shoot him or something ? Small smile from Al-Ghazi .
RONALD FLEURY: How does he know he slept soundly ?
FLEURY: How do they get them ?
RONALD FLEURY: How do we find him ?
GRANT SYKES: Whatever this is , it blasted-off like NASA .
SERGEANT HAYTHAM: Driven in at an angle go deeper
GRANT SYKES: ` High-order explosion ' does n't do it justice what 's left a ' this looks like it was put through a wood-chipper .
SERGEANT HAYTHAM: Hospital Identification Ambulance identification .
GRANT SYKES: Do you know this hospital ?
SERGEANT HAYTHAM: Yes .
GRANT SYKES: Call it in .
RONALD FLEURY: OK .
GRANT SYKES: We never get to do anything fun .
JANET MAYES: Sykes , I 'm guessing you do n't even emember how to load your gun .
GRANT SYKES: That 's not funny .
ADAM LEAVITT: She 's not trying to be funny .
GRANT SYKES: I 'm a very good shot .
JANET MAYES: I 'm sure .
GRANT SYKES: Prints are on the other side
RONALD FLEURY: JANET
JANET MAYES: Yeah I pulled so much it 's hard to remember it all .
RONALD FLEURY: Bolts ?
JANET MAYES: Yes .
RONALD FLEURY: Wing nuts ?
JANET MAYES: Yeah .
RONALD FLEURY: Razor blades ?
JANET MAYES: Sure .
GRANT SYKES: C-4
ADAM LEAVITT: The Coalition
JANET MAYES: -the Prince 's Convoy just showed . Al-Ghazi 's face fear .
RONALD FLEURY: This is bullshit . You know it . Meaningless . There 's no leade here . These are kids . That 's it .
JANET MAYES: We 're out of here .
RONALD FLEURY: Yes , that 's it . Smile for the cameras , body-bag some children . Wrap it up , but us out . I get it .
ADAM LEAVITT: You really ought not look at this .
DAMON SCHMIDT: That fella got shot right through his God damn nipple
JANET MAYES: Do n't stare too long . It 'll start living in your dreams .
DAMON SCHMIDT: No I know .
RONALD FLEURY: You do ? How did you know we were here ?
DAMON SCHMIDT: The Prince has Men at Al-Rahmah .
RONALD FLEURY: -Ellis Leach ?
DAMON SCHMIDT: You know him ? He 's gon na be put out to pasture made an example of by the President to ensure all levels of government get tough on Terror . You won the hand on the River card .
RONALD FLEURY: We did n't win shit , Schmidt . These are teenagers children with pictures that someone far senio has provided them .
DAMON SCHMIDT: -kidding me ? You mean those are Terrorist targets ? Holy Wow . Momma , do n't let your children grow up to be cowboys . Just get ready to go home and revel in the fact that for the next few weeks your shit wo n't stink .
RONALD FLEURY: Hello ? Yes , Sir . We 're all here and healthy . I 'm sitting next to thei corpses but this may not be over . These do n't feel like anything esembling senior leadership- -thank you Sir . I do .
RONALD FLEURY: What do you think ?
GRANT SYKES: I 'm thinking about going straight to Dan 's , gon na order six PBRs-
JANET MAYES: -Pabst ?
ADAM LEAVITT: Keep it real . You ever drink PBR , Haytham ?
HAYTHAM: No .
GRANT SYKES: Any beer ?
HAYTHAM: No .
GRANT SYKES: Nowthat 's just unreasonable . Good Police work and problem drinking are like a chicken and egg thing which enables the other ?
RONALD FLEURY: Remember how we caught that cell ?
GRANT SYKES: I 'm serious . Beer will open up you subconscious . Canned bee especially . Give you instincts they ca n't teach-
RONALD FLEURY: Is he responding to the call ? Dropped back
ADAM LEAVITT: Think so-
RONALD FLEURY: WHAT THE-
RONALD FLEURY: GUN !
GRANT SYKES: -DOOR HELP-
RONALD FLEURY: Hands up you 're gon na fall-
SERGEANT HAYTHAM: They 're going to disappear
SYKES: Nobody 's gon na hurt Leavitt but me .
MERCEDES DRIVER: He 's been shot ! BE READY .
PASSPORT OFFICER: NOW . HURRY .
GRANT SYKES: -GET OUT OF-
FLEURY: MOB FORMING NEXT BLOCK !
DRIVER: READY ?
RONALD FLEURY: RPG !
JANET MAYES: I do not like these people .
RONALD FLEURY: We go in the front door . Haytham - cover the stairs . Janet - hallway . Watch the side doors . Watch you acks . Silent nods . Bracing for war
JANET MAYES: ADAM ? !
RONALD FLEURY: Everybody OK ?
FLEURY: There 's at least three more of them .
JANET MAYES: It 's okay Little One .
NASSAR: You are a traitor to you country a traitor to your God .
RONALD FLEURY: Do n't
HAYTHAM: Thank you .
JANET MAYES: Thank you , Lieutenant Haytham .
HAYTHAM: May peace be with you .
FLEURY: May peace be with all of us , my friend . The two men shake hands .
DIRECTOR GRACE: We 're going to testify next Tuesday . Fleury 's going first . I 'm gon na go through it with each of you one on one in advance - make sure we 're all on the same page . If they ask if we 've talked about this , the answer is unequivocally `` No . '' OK ? You did outstanding work ove there . I 'm proud of you . You hold your heads high . SILENCE from the team .
RONALD FLEURY: Yeah .
ADAM LEAVITT: Janet my dreams are What did he whisper to you ? Confusion from Janet .
AUNT: Will you tell me what Grandfathe whispered to you before they took him ? He turns to his Aunt
ADAM LEAVITT: Do you remember ? Janet looks at Leavitt , PAUSES
GRANDSON: `` Do n't worry we 'll kill them all . ''
KEVIN FLEURY: You stop the people that hurt Uncle Fran ?
RONALD FLEURY: Yeah , there are But you want to know something ?
KEVIN FLEURY: What ?
RONALD FLEURY: You 're not one of them .
KLUTE: Klute . With a K. K - L - U -
ROSS: Are you with plant security , Sergeant ?
KLUTE: Town Police .
ROSS: Then how are you involved ?
KLUTE: I know Tom Grunemann .
ROSS: You knew the subject Thomas Grunemann . How well ?
KLUTE: We grew up together . Kids .
ROSS: Can you account for his disappearance in any way ?
KLUTE: No .
ROSS: Did he recently appear to you agitated or depressed ? indicates no Did he voice to you grievance or discontent with his research work here ? Indicates no . Moral or sexual problems o peculiarities ?
KLUTE: No .
ROSS: Marital problems in general ? Indicates possibly am I right Sergeant ?
KLUTE: Everybody 's got some , I guess .
ROSS: Did he ever mention specifically a girl or woman in New York ?
KLUTE: No .
ROSS: Examine this letter please . We recovered that from the shredde the plant disposal and incinerator system . Grunemann apparently typed it Friday , before he left , decided not to send it , tossed it away . We 've already contacted the New York Police ; they think they know the girl in question .
HOLLY: My husband was not like that ! My God , Klute .
KLUTE: It looks like he sent her quite a few of those Holly the girl she recalls six or seven letters like
HOLLY: No . I mean sure a little rough stuff , but just what people usually No , I would 've said we were pretty good . Johnnie I do n't understand . I just do n't understand .
ROSS: has disclosed no evidence of crime or criminal intent within the jurisdiction of this bureau , and since subject Thom
CABLE: It 's been almost a year ! Tom Grunemann 's been missing for a year . And all the FBI has to offe is a report that must bore even you .
ROSS: Well sir .
STREIGER: Are you closing the case ?
ROSS: No sir , we do n't state that . We 're countin
CABLE: But you do n't find it worth much effort .
ROSS: Well Mr. Cable , you 've got me here from the Bureau . You got Lieutenant Trask here from New York epresenting his department and I do n't frankly consider
STREIGER: Why could n't you ever find out anything from the girl ?

STREIGER: Why not ?
TRASK: Oh a good call girl , she 'll turn six-seven hundred tricks a year . The faces get blurred . And since then , recent months , she 's reported several , you know , incidents like breather calls , anonymous phone calls , also somebody maybe following her , watching her , things like that . So it 's I guess you could say , conceivable Grunemann 's still around there , just hangin around her , spooking her . But you know , that

KLUTE: I want to know how Tom Grunemann got mixed up in it .
SPANGLER: Not unusual .
KLUTE: Did she talk about him to you ?
SPANGLER: About his letters that 's all she emembered . Quite violent material , I 'd say , obsessive , a quite sick man . But that 's not unusual either .
KLUTE: Has she talked with you since prison ?
SPANGLER: No . She had every good intention of it coming to me as a private patient , getting out of the life , devoting herself to an acting career .
KLUTE: I think she 's trying that .
SPANGLER: Oh sure they try . The idea of a etter life . But they do n't really know much about life They get confused or scared or frustrated or bored they pop back to the one thing they can handle . The trick . The trick . Men in bed . Not men in general , not life , not love , not even real sex it avoids all that . Just the trick , the transaction .

MR. FABER: Please
BREE: Not young ; he was n't young gray at the temples , he well actually he looked like you .
MR. FABER: Yes ?
BREE: And nobody could tell me who he was an exiled prince or a mercenary or a bullfighter or but I felt it stirring inside me , this this wild , pagan feeling
BREE: Why n't you just cut out ?
KLUTE: No , I 'm look
BREE: If I was taking calls full time would I be living in this kip ? I 'd e back on Park Avenue ; I could support the whole National Guard !

BREE: They showed me that one . I understand it 's Grunemann , but I told them , I just do n't remember . Klute tosses down a second photograph .

So try to remember when you and he - when well I do n't know , there was that dumper once , he sounded like that dumper Dumpers ; they get their kicks eating you up . A man hired me once , then tried to really kill me - that 'd be about two years ago .
KLUTE: What ? What do you remember about that dumper ?
BREE: Nothing . Except he was n't kidding . Usually it 's a fakeout , you probably know . They pretend to tie you up , and you wear a dress with a cloth belt and they pretend to whip you or you Hell it 's their money . I 'll hang from the shower rod and whistle Maytime . Except this guy was really tripped out on it ; he
KLUTE: But you ca n't say that Dumper was Tom Grunemann .
BREE: I ca n't say he was anybody !
KLUTE: What about everything since ? She draws back again . Up to now she 's been
BREE: Just phone calls , right ? They ring , you answer , they do n't say anything , just blank . Kids getting kicks . Burglars looking for an empty apartment . I mean there is nothing that proves
KLUTE: What about the other things you 've eported ? being followed on the
BREE: Look I 'm sorry I 've led everybody wrong . I mean yes , I get those feelings , but that 's just me , that 's just feelings . I 'm sure this will amuse you ; I 'm scared of the dark . And sometimes I get shook up , I hea people or well , I 'll come out in the morning and think someone 's een prying at my mailbox , o there 's a little trash outside my door and I wonder if someone left it there for do you see ? things other people would n't even notice . Well that 's not real , it 's just nerves ; it 's got nothing to do with

BREE: Most of them .
KLUTE: Is that how you met the Dumper ? Someone else gave

BREE: I go on rounds .
KLUTE: Rounds , what are they ? do n't watch me , keep talking .
BREE: You go see agents or Equity calls , open casting calls . And ad agencies commercials you do n't get work , you just go around . Klute has strolled out of view from above
KLUTE: I could n't get him . He sees her condition . Gently
BREE: Well do you think it was him ?
KLUTE: What do you think ?
BREE: Ca n't you get him ?

FRANK: Well Bree , maybe you 'd rather
BREE: Yeah Frank , I know that .
FRANK: I 've always respected Bree . I 'd like to make something clear .
KLUTE: I 've just got a few
FRANK: I 'd like to make something clear . I do n't go after a girl ; a girl comes to me . Her choice . Right ?
KLUTE: I 'm looking for a man . Tom Grunemann . Bree thinks he may have been the dumper that call she had two years ago . She says you sent her on it .
FRANK: Two years ago ? Sorry .
KLUTE: They tell me you use narcotics . Could I bring someone around to look at your arms ?
FRANK: Look dad I may stand bette with the cops than you . Klute waits .

FRANK: OK and one of them Jane McKenna she blows a little jealous of Bree - you know ? Bree comes first ? And evidently she knew the freak - that he was a dumper she conned me into passing him to Bree , you know , so Bree 'd get hurt . I did n't know . Till afterwards .
KLUTE: Why did n't you tell Bree , afterwards ?
FRANK: You do n't tell them . That one of their own in-laws laid a dumper on them ? Peace in the family . Beyond that , I do n't know . All she wrote .
KLUTE: I 'd like to talk with Jane McKenna .
FRANK: Would I be telling you all this ? She copped out long ago . She committed suicide Baxter .
BREE: Did you like my friend Frankie ?
KLUTE: No .
BREE: Did n't he tell you what you wanted ?
KLUTE: It did n't go anywhere . But that 's not why
BREE: About the dumper , did n't he tell you that ?
KLUTE: It was Jane McKenna who sent you the dumper .
BREE: Well she 's dead . At the corner he slows , starts unzipping his ookcase as if indicating a change of route .
KLUTE: You said you wanted these . He hands over the TAPE-REELS .

BREE: What 're you gon na do next ?
KLUTE: Try some other ways .
BREE: What do I do meanwhile ? wait fo that clown to fall through the skylight on me ?
KLUTE: And I do n't think that was Tom .
BREE: You said it was !
KLUTE: No , I said what did you think .

KLUTE: Not much point to this , is there ?
BREE: Ezra , I 'm lots better than you 're used to . Tell me the othe night , watching me with Mr. Faber was n't your tongue a little bit hanging out ?

PRODUCER: Booth Osman Zuff Anjeris Chaka . WIDER , near stage front .
KLUTE: You asked if there was anything more you could help me with .
BREE: When ? Pause . Impasse .
KLUTE: I 've checked the records of Jane McKenna 's death I ca n't get anything special . But Frank Ligourin had another girl you said , esides McKenna and you .
BREE: Arlyn Page .
KLUTE: Did she and Jane McKenna know each other ?
BREE: Frankie kept them in the same apartment it cut his travel-time .
KLUTE: Then maybe Arlyn Page knew the Dumper too .
BREE: Arlyn had a very big habit - heroin - she 's the one who started Frank . She 's strung out now ; you wo n't find her .
KLUTE: You could help me find her . You know the people . I 'll pay you a hundred dollars .
BREE: I can make that in a lunch break ! Look , Hiram , you 're sure it is n't just me ? you decided you liked it , after all , the other night ; you 'll hang around for seconds ?
KLUTE: Do n't worry .

BREE: A new daddy . I ' n he cute ? Bree leads on to where
TRINA: Oh yes Mr. Klute wo n't you both join me ? And how do you like our fair city ? There 's so much here do n't you think ? The museums and the books and the foreign films Bree , have you seen the Godard film ?

BREE: Trina honey , he just wants to find Arlyn Page .
TRINA: Why ? She 's a junkie .
BREE: She was with you after she left Frank .
TRINA: Well she 's not now . I did everything for Arlyn . I loved Arlyn I took her right into my apartment , my own sweet apartment on First . But she would n't stay off it the junk and I wept and I pleaded and I held her in my arms - and she started taking things , my things , and selling them for horse . My clothes . We could 've had everything together , everything and then the bitch sold my mink !
FIRST GIRL: Arlyn Page ?
SECOND GIRL: You 'll never catch up ; she 's grooved out .
BREE: Gil ?
KLUTE: I 'm not looking for her personally - someone she might know about .
PIMP: Try Janie Dale .
JANIE DALE: It 's old Mr. Clean from Cleveland . He wants to know when he can fly in and clean up the apartment and see you . I told him I have all the cleaning equipment and that he can come anytime , but it 's up to you . GIRL on couch rises .
GIRL: You know he wants us to be dominant .
JANIE DALE: Tell him that he 'd better have his ass in here by one o'clock on Monday afternoon or you wo n't let him clean the bathroom floor , and tell him the price has gone up twenty bucks Old Dutcn Cleanser 's not as cheap as it used to be . She shrugs and turns to KLUTE & BREE .
KLUTE: Do you know where she went ?
JANIE DALE: Try Momma Reese .
MOMMA REESE: Try Bill Azure . If you can find him .
AZURE: a couple weeks then she 'd drift off a couple of weeks , you know what I mean ?
KLUTE: Have you heard from her recently ?
AZURE: She liked me all right but she had what she liked better , you know what I mean ? We START FADE SOUND as Klute repeats
KLUTE: Have you heard from her recently ? and CUT TO
PROPRIETRESS: She 'd come in and I 'd let he have something . Why not ; she 'd been a good customer , a beautiful person , a beautiful beautiful person .
MRS. VASEK: The whore , yeah . I threw out .
KLUTE: Do you know where she went from here ?
MRS. VASEK: Live like animals . Her and the man . Out .
KLUTE: Was she living with a man ? We see Klute persisting - DISSOLVE
BREE: What the hell do you think 's the matter . I could wait for you someplace .
KLUTE: If Arlyn Page is living with Tom Grunemann
BREE: Then you do n't need me .
KLUTE: But if it 's someone else I do .
BREE: You sure pull a lot of mileage out of a hundred dollars .
BERGER: Cappy , I got a radio !
ARLYN: No
BREE: Arlyn , he just wanted to ask some questions something you could help us about .
ARLYN: Ca n't you see I 'm strung out ? Please , we 're waiting for it he 's got to have it !
KLUTE: We 'll go . Just something you could tell us , first .
BREE: Honey , a couple of years ago , with Jane and Frankie ? Jane sent me a Dumper
ARLYN: Please , if he sees you , he wo n't come !
BREE: Arlyn , just tell me , did Jane have a dumper , one of her regular Johns ?
ARLYN: What about him ? Yes .
BREE: Did he come around often ?
ARLYN: No . He was an older man hon . The dumper was older .
KLUTE: Do you remember his name ? What can you tell me about him ?
ARLYN: Please , I am begging you .
KLUTE: It 's important .
ARLYN: That 's not the Dumper , that 's all ! He was an older man !
KLUTE: Can you give me any more description than that ?
ARLYN: Cappy ?
CABLE: She would n't be reliable anyhow a narcotics addict .
KLUTE: I believed her , Pete .
TRASK: He 's right you know . Waiting fo the pusher , she 'd tell you anything .
KLUTE: I believed her the Dumper was not Tom Grunemann .
CABLE: All right , suppose it was n't Tom Grunemann ; where does that get you ?
KLUTE: It 's where it does n't get me . I 've got nothing left that connects to anything .
CABLE: Then , close the case .
KLUTE: I better keep looking .
CABLE: Where , how ?
KLUTE: I could try Arlyn Page again . She saw much more of the Dumper than Bree Daniel .
CABLE: You just finished telling me she had nothing to offer . Not Tom , you said , the Dumper was clearly not Tom .
KLUTE: It 's got to make sense some way .
SECRETARY: Mr. Cable they are meeting in Mr. Camara 's office .
CABLE: Yes Evvie , thanks . Gentlemen , I 'm sorry .
KLUTE: How is it back there ?
CABLE: I think you 're homesick . I 'll be out at my camp over the weekend . Nice right now , that touch of fall in the air , that skim of frost in the early mornings , very peaceful . John , I 'll be back here again Thursday ; I 'll be in touch . Lieutenant , thank you . KLUTE and TRASK depart .
TRASK: They were bringing a freighter down through Kill Van Kull ; propellers washed it up on top .
SUGARMAN: Why did n't you bring it up on deck ?
DECKHAND: Would you bring it up on deck ?
SPENCE: They 'll drop off theirselves when she comes out . We CUT TO -
TRASK: It 'll go to the Examiner . But I do n't see nothin that means nothin .
SUGARMAN: You help us with ID ? We ca n't get nothin from him . He indicates the direction of Berger . Klute examines the clipboard data .
KLUTE: Arlyn Page was probably an alias . She went by the names Terry Arlyn and June Price . She may have been from Pittsburgh , someone told me . I can give you a list of people who knew her , if that would help to
SUGARMAN: No point , thanks .
KLUTE: Is he claiming the body ?
SUGARMAN: Uh uh , that 'd mean funeral expenses .
BERGER: Man could you help me ? Klute does n't understand his purport , reacts instantly , sympathetically
KLUTE: Yeah , what ?
BERGER: You know , help me out . That 's my aby there , dead . I got to get up .
KLUTE: You 've got to get up .
BERGER: Yeah .

KLUTE: Yeah .
BREE: Well hello come on in .
KLUTE: I thought you ought to know , Arlyn Page is dead .
BREE: How ?
KLUTE: The same as Jane McKenna .
BREE: Thanks for the jolly news . I thought maybe you 'd left town by now . You kind of just disappeared . But you boys from Tuscarora have a habit of disappearing , do n't you ?
KLUTE: The next few weeks I would like to know where you are all the time .
BREE: Why ?
KLUTE: Just let me know when you are going out and where
BREE: What if i go out on tricks - you wan na come along ? You could sit and ead the National Geographic .
KLUTE: How can you do it to yourself ?
BREE: I do n't get you .
KLUTE: Ligourin How could you do it ?
BREE: I told you before , you would n't understand .
KLUTE: You 're right , I do n't understand . Explain it to me . You were scared . Arlyn Page , that scared you . Well it should ; that 's death . So what did you do , you ran straight for it , death . Ligourin kills women .
BREE: No .
KLUTE: No , no you 're right , I 'm sorry . He uses women ; he lets them kill themselves . Is that how you want it ?
BREE: Arlyn was a junkie ; I 'm not on junk !
KLUTE: No , you can find some other way . Explain it to me . Bree , show me any sense to
BREE: You get the Christ out ! You dum stupid bastard , you do n't know anything , you square , you get out ! I do n't have to show you anything ; you get out ! Klute goes .

BREE: Please .
KLUTE: We did this before .
BREE: No . Well all right . But you want to and I want you to and we both know it and all right .
KLUTE: I do n't like getting splashed .
BREE: OK - OK
KLUTE: - Bree -
BREE: I 'm still scared . I mean different but still . Look , I made it very clear from the start , you 're a yokel , you do n't excite me , you do n't even interest me , and so I only have one question which is what the hell are you doing in my bed ?
KLUTE: My bed .
BREE: Oh !
KLUTE: Mm .
BREE: No , not just 'mm ' . You do n't know what I
KLUTE: Yup .
BREE: Oh And we cut directly to
SPANGLER: I 'd just be guessing .
BREE: Guess !
SPANGLER: Maybe this was n't just a trick . Maybe you 're in danger of real love , real involve
BREE: I do not love him .
SPANGLER: You 've spent your life avoiding this . You 'll try hard to deny it ; you 're quite likely to destroy it .
CUSTODIAN: Four five what number 'd I say ?
KLUTE: Four ninety-seven , Jane McKenna
CUSTODIAN: And I keep the authorization , please .
KLUTE: I thought there 'd be more .
TRASK'S VOICE: All right , there 's Tom Grunemann , you 're right , different margins , different spacing absolutely , sloppy , right .
KLUTE'S VOICE: Mm .
TRASK'S VOICE: All right , try this next guy . The right-hand document is switched .
TRASK: Think this is our guy ?
KLUTE: I do n't know . It looks familiar to me .
TRASK: Thought it might . It 's off an arrest report you typed two years ago . Man you wanted samples of everybody .
TRASK'S VOICE: Same margins top and sides . He does est with his middle fingers ; you get fainter registration from outside keys like Q , A , L , P and like that . Next thing look around apostrophes , how he hits the space ar before
KLUTE: But what reason could he have ? What possible reason ?
TRASK: Unless he was involved with Grunemann 's disappearance .
KLUTE: I knew Tom never wrote that letter .
TRASK: What else do you know ?
KLUTE: I never could believe that Tom was a split personality . I neve elieved he was a Dumper ; and I do n't believe he disappeared of his own volition ; and I do n't believe he 's alive .
TRASK: We have some very tentative circumstantial evidence of freeky ehavior , but there 's no evidence of murder - there 's not even a ody .
KLUTE: I do n't believe Tom 's alive . As Klute talks he paces back and forth in the darkness . He crosses in front of the lighted
CABLE'S VOICE: John , how are you ?
KLUTE: I 'll be sending you on a report tonight .
CABLE'S VOICE: It 's a beautiful day in Tuscarora - I do n't envy you that humidity in the city .
KLUTE: It 's not so bad .
CABLE'S VOICE: What 's in it ?
KLUTE: I think Tom Grunemann 's dead . I 've een a lot of places - I 've asked a lot of people . I 've found no proof he 's around . I 've found no proof he was ever around .
CABLE VOICE: How do you go from that to the idea Tom 's dead ? Suicide you 're suggesting ? He killed himself ?
KLUTE: He could 've been murdered .
CABLE'S VOICE: I 'm sure the FBI and the Police explored that possibility .
KLUTE: No . They never did , really . But that 's what I 'm going to recommend . The next step . Unless something
CABLE'S VOICE: Have you discussed this with them ?
KLUTE: It 's in the report .
CABLE'S VOICE: Do they have the report ? Have you discussed it with them ?
KLUTE: I wanted to give it to you first .
CABLE'S VOICE: All right . All right John , just sit tight will you ? I 'll ead your report , I 'll discuss it with the others . I 'll be back next Thursday , we 'll talk the whole thing over then . Nothing til Thursday , all right ?
KLUTE: All right .
CABLE'S VOICE: Thank you . Goodbye , John .
KLUTE: Goodbye , Pete . Klute hangs up .
BREE: I saw Mr. Faber . You remember Mr. Faber , do n't you ?
KLUTE: Yeah .
BREE: Is that all you have to say ?
KLUTE: What am I supposed to say ?
BREE: Well , I told him I would n't - uh - go there any more . I know it 's tough to understand , ut it was n't easy . You see , he was nice to me . I mean , it was n't just him . I got something out of it too I guess . Anyway , I told him I would n't go there anymore . She is like a child awaiting praise from he
KLUTE: Well , here 's your gold star .
BREE: Spangler says we have a elationship .
KLUTE: What ?
BREE: You and I a relationship .
KLUTE: I was wondering what that was .
BREE: Hell there 's nothing so mysterious about the square life .
KLUTE: Do n't touch anything .
BREE: You suppose he 's a married fella ?
BREE: He got in my clothing !
KLUTE: Drop it .
BREE: My God , I thought it was over . And here I am , daddy , right back at the start .
KLUTE: Bree
BREE: Right back at the start , right ?
KLUTE: Go down in my room .
BREE: You said it was over , right ? You said not to worry any more , all over , right ?
KLUTE: Go down in my room and wait . Then he turns back into the apartment .
ROSS: But if Cable killed Grunemann why would he get you hired to look fo Grunemann ?
KLUTE: Because he knew I could n't leave the case alone . And this way at least he 'd keep track of it . And me .
ROSS: What about Grunemann 's letters to the girl , everything like that ?
TRASK: Cable 's letters , Cable 's phone calls . Cable 's everything else . He 's been a Dumper a long time . He just passed off his own peculia habits on the other man it kept things goin ' .
ROSS: OK , pretend I believe you . Tell me how you get an indictment .
TRASK: Ca n't . Yet . Oh we got everythin ' else first rate evidence Cable typed those dumper letters to Bree Daniel . And Jane McKenna Klute found a couple in her personal emains . We got dates of Cable 's trips here coincidin ' with phone calls to Bree Daniel , also the dates of death of McKenna and Page . We got some hints of his personal history . His father , unsuccessful salesman , committed suicide when he was 13 . His mother pinned all he hopes on her son . He won a national science youth award at the age of eight . They had no money , but she hired special tutors for him in the summer time . She saw a good thing . He graduated from high school at 14 college at 16 no friends The kids in his class thought of him as a freak . He got his Ph.D. at 18 married at age 21 to his then employer 's daughter . The marriage lasted 4 weeks . Her father had it annulled . She says he was impotent . World War II he got in bad trouble about a German girl , no details . We think we know why he killed Grunemann he found out Cable was a dumper ; Cable could n't take that . We think we know why he killed McKenna she wanted to blackmail him for it . All fine . But we got no ody , no direct witnesses , we ca n't go any-damn-where .
KLUTE: That 's the reason i told him we had no evidence Tom was still alive . We wanted to shake him into anothe phone call or another letter . It did n't work out just that way .
TRASK: Gov , want to leave me that one . How come he got to play with this one , anyway .
KLUTE: I left them here . I was doing some work here .
TRASK: It 's damn lucky you did n't have the dossier on Cable here .
KLUTE: Nobody 's seen that .
TRASK: If we get anything from the lab , we 'll have it by noon . And just think all he really had to do was write us a letter .
ROSS: Sounds to me you better shake him again . Put him in a spot he has to do something more but this time give him a time and a place to do it .
KLUTE: He called this morning from Tuscarora . Asked me to meet him at 3 00 at the downtown heliport . He 's on his way to Chicago .
TRASK: He sure chalks up a lot of flight time .
BREE: Ah , Schmendrick what 's the scam ?
KLUTE: Those were police laboratory people , they 've been over the apartment .
BREE: Oh zippidy-doo , they 'll find my fingerprints . Can I go in ? I need some stuff . He nods ; she starts by . Then
KLUTE: Where 'd you spend last night ?
BREE: With Trina .
KLUTE: I called Trina .
BREE: Maybe I was n't there when you called .
KLUTE: Bree , what 's actually happened ? It was n't that bad .
BREE: How do you know how bad it was ?
KLUTE: Why could n't you stay here with me ?
BREE: Because I did n't want to be touched ! I did n't think you 'd get that ! Pause . Then , evenly
KLUTE: Trask wants to talk with you .
BREE: Hey look officer I can explain everything . It was just you know , everything all of a
KLUTE: Trask wants to talk with you . She continues on up ; Klute continues down .
TRASK: Miss Daniel , be sensible , you find another place till we get things cleaned up .
BREE: Oh well that should n't take you more than another , oh , two and a half or three years , should it ?
TRASK: A few more days . We know who did this .
BREE: So do I .
TRASK: No , not Grunemann . He 's dead . The man that killed him also prob'ly Jane McKenna , also Arlyn Page . She spins around mute terrified .
BREE: Arlyn and Jane commited suicide . He said they commited suicide .
TRASK: Now there 's a picture I 'd like you to
BREE: You said someone killed them , you said you know who , you said that .
TRASK: Well we 're pretty
BREE: Why is n't he locked up ?
TRASK: We do n't want to just lock him up ; we want a conviction , we wanted him to do something more .
BREE: Is that why Klute did n't tell me ?
TRASK: I guess he figured it was better .
BREE: What was better ? I made bette ait ?
TRASK: No , that 's not
BREE: Is that what he set me up for ? Everything he 's told me from the eginning ? do n't worry , do n't
TRASK: From the beginning I do n't know why the hell he 's messin with you . If he was me he 'd know better . If he was even a city boy he 'd know etter . You 're a whore Miss Daniel , that 's the truth of it , right ? Now somethin I 'd like you to look at .
BREE: I do n't have to look at anything . I do n't have
TRASK: Here please .
BREE: Oh no .
TRASK: Like for you to look for the man .
BREE: Grunemann ? I 've looked at him a
TRASK: No . Not Grunemann . The Dumper . Just look around I said look for the Dumper .
BREE: Oh ! and WE CUT TO
CABLE: Sorry we had to meet here . But I 'm pressed for time .
KLUTE: Well there 's a couple
CABLE: I read your report . I had to go along with it the idea of this eing a wild goose chase , Tom being nowhere around
KLUTE: Well as a matter of
CABLE: I 've been up country , you know my summer place , my camp . I do n't even have a telephone there . This morning they sent a messenger out , that you 'd been trying to call me .
KLUTE: Yeah .
CABLE: I 'm on my way to Chicago . Very important meeting tonight . Well any new developments ?
KLUTE: Yeah , two things Pete , that
CABLE: You said Trask was arranging laboratory work . Police laboratory . Anything from that ?
KLUTE: Yeah . It was n't Tom .
CABLE: I 'm sorry . I do n't understand .
KLUTE: It was n't Tom that broke in the oom .
CABLE: It has to be Tom . You said he ipped up his own pictures , he
KLUTE: Not Tom . Whoever it was left a kind of souvenir , I told you , in he clothing . Semen . The laboratory got a blood group reading from that . The man was blood type 0 ; Tom was an AB .
CABLE: Some mistake perhaps that
KLUTE: No . No mistake Pete . It does n't prove who it was but proves it was n't Tom .
CABLE: You must be discouraged .
KLUTE: Not too bad . This brings back that Dumper in the picture .
CABLE: That who ?
KLUTE: Dumper , the man Bree Daniel mentioned and Arlyn Page knew and Jane McKenna knew .
CABLE: You said he was no possible connection with Tom . The Page girl told you that , not Tom .
KLUTE: Someone 's been doing all these things .
CABLE: You were hired to look for Tom , not someone .
KLUTE: Pete , I 've got a chance to buy Jane McKenna 's black book .
CABLE: What ?
KLUTE: Call-girls generally keep a book , you know , a list of their clients . Sometimes , if a girl retires , she 'll even sell it worth good money . Jane McKenna had a black ook ; when she died it was stolen . I 've been after it a long time .
CABLE: You were hired to look for Tom .
KLUTE: I 'm meeting a man tomorrow night . He wants to meet me on East-Rive Drive he wants five hundred dollars for the book . Can you get that for me Pete ?
CABLE: I ca n't follow you .
KLUTE: Will the Company put up five hundred dollars to get Jane McKenna 's list of clients ?
CABLE: No . It 's ridiculous . This has nothing to do with Tom Grunemann .
KLUTE: It probably has the Dumper 's name . It might give us some kind of new lead . I want a look at it anyhow .
CABLE: Klute , the Company 's interest is Tom Grunemann . Solely and exclusively . You say you ca n't find Tom ; all right , I 'll see that you 're paid off ; the case is closed .
KLUTE: All right , but I 'm going to see that list .
CABLE: Why would they deal with you ? You do n't know these people .
KLUTE: No , but Bree does . She 's negotiating for me . Bree Daniel .
CABLE: I can talk it over ; possibly I can get the money . When are you meeting the man ?
KLUTE: Tomorrow evening , nine . East Rive Drive and 73rd Street .
CABLE: Suppose I meet you there a half hour before .
KLUTE: Just send me a money order .
CABLE: No , I 'd like to be in on it . ATTENDANT comes over to motion Cable onto the helicopter . Klute smiles awkwardly , raises his hand in a goodbye gesture .
KLUTE: Well
CABLE: Tomorrow . See you tomorrow night .
KLUTE: Bree ?
BREE: Trask said I should move . Let 's not make a thing of it . He continues to look at her ; she continues to
FRANK: That 's right . This other girl 's got a very big apartment , big , plenty of room . Look , it 's not necessarily how it looks , right ? It 's
KLUTE: No . Please . Not with this son of a itch . Frank rises , both nervous and offended but dealing with Klute as between civilized men . Smiling .
FRANK: Klute , let 's handle it like grownups ? I mean we 're all grown up now , right ? we all respect each other , you know what I mean ? I respect you , Bree respects you you could say , it just did n't work out between you and she . But you got to respect he too you know , her best interests , best for her
BREE: No !
FRANK: Hey , I 'm gon na get you dropped .
KLUTE: Please
BREE: until he gets back . Yes I heard you , I understand that . I said I 'm going to come over , I 'll wait until he gets back .
KLUTE: Hello ? Trask , I do n't get that .
KLUTE: Who told you , his secretary ? Has someone checked his hotel ? He always stays at the I 'll look around , I 'll call you ack .
LELA: I have to close up now . Leave your name and number with his message service , Mrs. Daniel , and why do n't you just go home and wait until he
BREE: No .
LELA: Well I have to close up now .
BREE: Look could I use your phone ?
LELA: Yes indeed .
BREE: Look . I almost killed my I almost killed someone .
LELA: Well I 'm certain Doctor Spangle will want to talk with you ; excuse me .
FABER: Yes ? Bree ?
BREE: I 'm I just have to talk to someone . I 'm just a little way across town
FABER: Yes - yes dear , yes maybe half an hour , sure , yes . He hangs up . An ancient stirring , a kind of
KLUTE: Trina , will you call me if you hea from , her ? Will you check othe people she might call ? Yeah , if it was n't trouble I would n't ask vou .
FOREMAN: Lady , it 's closing up there .
BREE: What ?
FOREMAN: We 're closing up , quitting time , Fabers .
BREE: I have an appointment with Mr. Faber .
FOREMAN: Oh , yeah . He lets her pass , glances after her like the others , continues on his way .
BREE: I have an appointment with Mr. Faber .
RECEPTIONIST: In there . Mr. Faber
CONT'D: Mr. Faber
NATHAN: Yes ?
BREE: I 'm sorry Mr. Faber Senior .
NATHAN: My father went home about fifteen minutes ago ; he was n't feeling too good .
BREE: It was n't important .
RECEPTIONIST: Oh , I thought that was fo tomorrow . The Receptionist riffles through a stack of
BREE: Bree Daniel . Has he called in yet ? Well if he does , I 'm at two seven eight , three one hundred , and I guess I can wait here five minutes ; then I 'll try from somewhere else . Just tell him Bree Daniel ; he knows who . She hangs up , goes back to readdressing the envelope . FOOTSTEPS are approaching in he direction . She glances up apologetically .
KLUTE: Did she leave a number ? This is a police call ; do n't make me take time to prove it . Did she leave a number ? What is the number ? What is the number ?
CABLE: Ca n't we talk together reasonably , just ordinarily ? I know you 're expecting some kind of extravagant behavior , but elieve me do you believe me ?
BREE: Yes all right
CABLE: We can talk
BREE: Yes .
CABLE: All right , then , an ordinary matter . I 'm a quite well off man , I have a position to respect . I would feel personally uncomfortable to be connected with a certain kind of woman , I 'm sure you understand . Do you ? Well I 'd like to buy Jane McKenna 's book .
BREE: Yes Jane McKenna 's book I could make a phone call .
CABLE: No , you 're frightened , you 're pretending . Well Klute knows about me then . Does everybody know , can you tell me ?
BREE: Yes .
CABLE: Then it does n't matter what I do any more , does it ? Pause . Then he shudders slightly .
CABLE: I 've got no idea what I shall do .
BREE: Will you let me go then ?
CABLE: It puzzles me so badly . I 've done terrible things but I ca n't consider myself a terrible man . I 've killed three people and I 'd still want to say it was accident , do you see ?
BREE: If you 'll let me go I could tell them what
CABLE: Tom Grunemann discovered me we were here on business together , he discovered me with Jane McKenna . Then I suppose it was the the contempt I saw in his face and the certainty that sooner or later he 'd use it against me . Within the Company . I endured that as long as I could , do you see ?
BREE: I 'm sorry , I 'm just frightened . Yes .
CABLE: Excuse me Miss Daniel ?
BREE: I said yes , I see .
CABLE: Oh no , I do n't think
BREE: Tell me . I 'll listen . I just want you to tell me .
CABLE: You 're willing to listen ? You want me just to keep talking ? He hits her .
KLUTE: Come on . Come on .
BREE: Hi .
KLUTE: I got a call from Ross this morning . Cable owned a plot of woodland he 'd go there on weekends . They found Tom Grunemann 's body buried there . They 've notified his wife .
BREE: Oh . Well it was n't us city people that did it your fine rosy-cheeked country boy .
KLUTE: Mm .
BREE: You 're going back ?
KLUTE: Mm .
BREE: Well suppose I had n't come downstairs . Would you just have folded up and sneaked away ?
KLUTE: No . I was going to come up . I wanted to ask you to marry me .
BREE: You wanted to , or you are ?
KLUTE: I am .
BREE: You could at least look at me !
KLUTE: About what ?
BREE: Look at me . I 'm pretty and sort of clever and very well intentioned , and dear God I 'd tear your heart out !
KLUTE: I do n't think so . He resumes packing , continues through the following .
BREE: How can you not think so ? You know the things I can do .
KLUTE: They do n't scare me any more .
BREE: What ?
KLUTE: Does n't scare me . I think we could handle it .
BREE: Please , I 'm a city person . I 'm sure it 's just as good as here but I 'm a city person , that 's all , I am ! Hell I know what it 's like . I was in Jersey once the frogs go bra-a p all night ! What'im I supposed to do ? Mend you socks and sing in the church choir ? ) Do you not believe I love you ? I 'm honestly , honestly just
KLUTE: OK .
BREE: You do n't believe that either , do you ? Why ca n't you see my side ?
KLUTE: Can you use these ?
BREE: Can I carry something for you , to the car ? Will you kiss me ?
KLUTE: No . I 'm sore . He moves to the door , pauses , half-smiles
BREE: Hey .
CHARLOTTE: Sadie , wake up .
SADIE: Oh my gosh .
CHARLOTTE: Daddy , wake up . Charlotte hits Pete .

CHARLOTTE: She hit me .
ALISON: Did you hit her ?
SADIE: I did not .
ALISON: Make her happy .
TO CHARLOTTE: It 's okay .
SADIE: It wo n't make her happy . She spilled all the marbles on the floor .
ALISON: Well , give her her marbles back .

ALISON: I did n't mean do it without a condom . I mean `` do it '' like `` hurry up , '' like `` get fucking going ! ''
BEN: Well , I assumed you were wearing a patch , or like a dental dam or one of those fuckin ' butterfly clips o something like that .
ALISON: What the hell is a dental dam ?
BEN: It 's like Saran Wrap ! It 's disgusting , okay ? But I thought you had one . Why the fuck did n't you stop me once we started ?

JONAH: I ca n't believe you did this . You fucked everything up .
JASON: Look , the real point is not to get yourself in this position . That 's what you have to realize . You got ta know all the tricks . Like , for example , if a woman 's on top , she ca n't get pregnant . It 's just gravity .
JONAH: Everyone knows that .
JASON: What goes up must come down .
JAY: I think it 's awesome that you 're gon na have a kid , man . Think of it like this . It 's just an excuse to play with all your old toys again .

She had the same situation as you and she had it taken care of . And you know what ? Now she has a real baby . Honey , this is not the time .
HARRIS: I 'm gon na be a grandfather .
BEN: You happy about that ?

HARRIS: An earthquake is a disaster . You grandmother having Alzheimer 's so bad she does n't even know who the fuck I am , that 's a disaster . This is a good thing . This is a blessing .
BEN: I had a vision for how my life would go and this definitely is not it .
HARRIS: Wait . Are you living your vision right now ?
BEN: I am kinda living my vision , yeah .
HARRIS: Well , that is sad , I 'm telling you . Life does n't care about your vision . Okay ?
BEN: Okay .
HARRIS: Stuff happens . You just got to deal with it . Roll with it . That 's the eauty of it all .
BEN: I just do n't get how I tell the kid not to do drugs when I do drugs . I 'll feel like a hypocrite .
HARRIS: Well you remember what I told you ? When you were a teenager ?
BEN: What did you say ?
HARRIS: I said , `` No pill , no powders . ''
BEN: That 's right , that 's right .
HARRIS: Right . If it grows in the ground , it 's probably okay .
BEN: I guess it worked . You told me not to smoke pot all those years . And then I found out you were smoking pot that whole time .
HARRIS: Not the whole time . Just in the evenings and all day every weekend . Not that much .
BEN: Honestly , though , when you look at me , do you not think at all , like , you know , if he just never existed , I would have avoided a massive heap of trouble ? You know ?
HARRIS: Absolutely not . I love you totally and completely . You 're the best thing that ever happened to me .
BEN: I 'm the best thing that ever happened to you ?

BEN: All right . Let 's go . See you guys later .
ALISON: The funny thing is I really had neve even thought about having a baby .
BEN: Yeah .
ALISON: If this had n't happened , I do n't think I would have wanted to have a baby for , like , I do n't know , at least ten years .
BEN: At least ! God , honestly , I just got used to the notion that someone would even have sex with me . I did n't think this would happen .
ALISON: It 's a beautiful picture , Ben .
BEN: It is . It 's not bad . Hello , Mommy . Our baby 's gon na be French Canadian . I like that .
ALISON: With a little hint of Spanish .
BEN: Exactly , I 'm not good with accents .
ALISON: Awesome .
BEN: `` What to Expect When You 're Expecting . ''
ALISON: What can we expect ?
BEN: Well , you ca n't eat sushi . You ca n't smoke . You ca n't smoke marijuana . You ca n't smoke crack . And you ca n't jump on trampolines . This is basically a giant list of things you ca n't do .
ALISON: It sounds thrilling .
BEN: I 'm gon na be sitting there on the trampoline smoking crack . And you 're not gon na have anything to do . You 're gon na be bored . But I ca n't wait to ead these , honestly . I put these in front of my toilet , though , they 'll be ead by tomorrow morning . Do you want me to get you that ?

DEBBIE: Ugh . Sounds awful . I 'm just really constipated . Do you really want to ?
PETE: Well , now .
DEBBIE: Shut up .
PETE: That 's pretty crazy how your sister 's pregnant .
DEBBIE: We have to help her .
PETE: I think they 'll be fine . They 'll work itLook at us . It happened to us .
DEBBIE: We 'll help her raise the baby .
PETE: Wellfuck !
BEN: At least we do n't have to use a condom , you know ? Alison pulls away . BEN But we can . I brought some just in case . I do n't have V.D . or anything . I mean , I do n't , I thought
ALISON: It 's not that .
BEN: It 's just I thought we could get a littlefun out of your situation , you know ?
ALISON: Okay , first of all , it 's not my situation . It 's our situation .
BEN: I know that .
ALISON: And just because I 'm pregnant , I 'm not some ruined woman and all romance goes out the door .
BEN: I 'm sorry . I like you a lot . That 's all this is .
ALISON: I like you , too .
BEN: Sweet .
ALISON: A little , so far . I mean , we have seven months before the baby comes . We do n't have to rush it .
BEN: Yeah .
ALISON: We should really just try to get to know each other andgive this a real shot . You know ? We got ourselves into this situation . We kind of have to .
BEN: For the baby , right ?
ALISON: Exactly . Okay , if this was our second date , what would you do ?
BEN: B.J . If I 'm just being honest . I told my roommates that I thought I was gon na get a B.J. , so
ALISON: You know what ? For the sake of getting to know one another , can you not talk like that ?
BEN: I can do that . I 'm really nervous .
ALISON: I 'm nervous , too . I 'm really nervous .
BEN: Yeah . Ben and Alison kiss .
ALISON: You 're a sweet guy , right ?
BEN: I think I am .

BEN: I would n't do that . Just so you know , I 'm the guy girls fuck over . I 'm that guy . So you do n't fuck me over , okay ?
ALISON: Okay .
BEN: I could n't take it . I ca n't raise this aby alone .
CHARLOTTE: Who 's he ?
BEN: I 'm Ben Stone .
ALISON: He 's my boyfriend .
PETE: That 's nice .
SADIE: I never met him before .
ALISON: He 's a new boyfriend .
BEN: But a boyfriend .
SADIE: So he came over for breakfast because he 's your new boyfriend ?
DEBBIE: He came from his house , drove over to our house because he thought it would e fun to have breakfast with us , so he drove his car from his house to ou house to have breakfast .
PETE: Because he likes breakfast so much .
CHARLOTTE: I love breakfast .
BEN: You guys wan na hear something neat ? We 're gon na have a baby together .
SADIE: What ?
BEN: Yeah , a baby .
SADIE: Well , you 're not married . Are n't you supposed to be married to have a baby ?
PETE: You do n't have to be .
DEBBIE: But they should be because they love each other and people who love each other get married and have babies .
SADIE: Where do babies come from ?
DEBBIE: Where do you think they come from ?
SADIE: Well , I think a stork , he drops it down , and then , a hole goes in you ody and there 's blood everywhere , coming out of your head , and then you push your belly-button , and then you utt falls off and then you hold you utt and you have to dig and you find a little baby .
DEBBIE: That 's exactly right .
CHARLOTTE: Feed the teddy bear .
BEN: I feed your bear the grass ? Know what your bear would also like to do with some grass ? Smoke it .
TO DEBBIE: What do you think of him ? He 's funny , ight ? Ben throws the bear 's bowl .
BEN: Fetch . All right , bring it back .
TO ALISON: He 's playing fetch with my kids . He 's treating my kids like they 're dogs .
TO DEBBIE: No 's he not . Ben throws the bear this time .
BEN: Go get it ! Fetch !
TO ALISON: Plays fetch with the kids .
BEN: All right !
TO DEBBIE: He 's trying . He 's making an effort .
CHARLOTTE: I do n't wan na play this anymore .
BEN: Bring it back .
TO ALISON: He 's overweight . Where does that end ? How old is he ?
TO DEBBIE: Twenty-three .
TO ALISON: Looks thirty-three . He can barely get in and out of that little house . Imagine how much bigger he 's going to get .
ALISON: Shit .
BEN: I 'm gon na get you !
TO DEBBIE: Just give him a break .
TO ALISON: Okay , I 'll try .
BEN: They seem to love bubbles .
PETE: They go ape-shit over bubbles .
BEN: They 're really going ape-shit .
PETE: That 's an incredible thing about a child . What 's so great about bubbles ?
BEN: They float . You can pop them . I mean , I get it . I get it .
PETE: I wish I liked anything as much as my kids like bubbles .
BEN: That 's sad .
PETE: It 's totally sad . Their smiling faces just point out your inability to enjoy anything .
BEN: Am I going to be okay , man ?
PETE: Who knows ? Is anybody okay ? I 'm not okay . You 're asking the wrong guy . Just do n't ask me to lend you any money , you know ?
BEN: Can I just have some ?
PETE: No .
JASON: I have fifteen years of tennis lessons .
JONAH: And twelve years of sucking dick lessons .

BEN: Exactly . I 'll take that .
JAY: Wll , see she 's bringing you to the gynechiatrist . She must like you .
BEN: That 's pretty good , I think .
JASON: You know who I 'd like to get pregnant is that Felicity Huffman , man . Eve since `` Transamerica , '' I ca n't get he out of my mind .
BEN: Guys , I hate to crack the whip , but it 's kind of , uh , business meeting time . I need moolah . When do you think we can launch this site ?
JAY: Geez .
JONAH: You ca n't rush this . You know what happens to these sites when they go up and they do n't function well ? They die .
BEN: Seriously , guys , let 's say I want to launch today . Let 's start let 's use that as a jumping off point . Let 's make this happen . What can we do ?
JONAH: Look , man , I did n't go to Yale so I could work twelve hours a day .
JASON: I thought you went to Santa Monica City College .
JONAH: I went where I went , Jason .
BEN: I 'm not asking you to work twelve hours a day . I mean , you guys watch movies without nudity in them .
JASON: I 'll tell you what , man . We could probably get it online in three months .
BEN: Thank you . Yes ! Three months .
JONAH: Come on , Jason !
JASON: Yeah , well , you still have a little dick , Cartman .
DR. KUNI: Do you smoke cigarettes ?

ALISON: Boobs and bush .
BEN: Those are good ones ! We 're like thirty- five seconds in .
ALISON: Right over the beginning credits .
BEN: Nice . Credit bush . You never get opening-credit bush .
ALISON: I know . That 's so crazy .
BEN: You got me . You got me .
ALISON: How many doctors are there in you practice ? Just because I 'm sort of looking for a more personal experience . I want to make sure that you 're my doctor on the day and
DR. HOWARD: I understand . We have three othe doctors in the practice but I 'm you man , okay ? I do n't take vacations . I hate Hawaii . I went to the Caribbean when I was fourteen and I 'm neve going back .
ALISON: I feel really good about this .
TO BEN: I think we found our doctor .
BEN: Really ?
ALISON: Yeah .
BEN: Oh , my God . Are you serious right now ?
DR. HOWARD: You look relieved .
BEN: I am very relieved .
DR. HOWARD: All right .
BEN: I ca n't imagine meeting and more of you people .
ALISON: You 're being dramatic . We did n't meet that many .
WARDROBE LADY: Ooh . Do they know ?

WARDROBE LADY: The belly .
ALISON: The doughnuts , they call to me .
YOU'RE: Jill walks by .
JILL: Hey , Alison !

WARDROBE LADY: It 's okay . We can hide this . We 'll dress you in black and we 'll emphasize your boobs .
ALISON: Awesome .
WARDROBE LADY: Your boobs are going to be big . And then they 're going to be like scary ig . But then they 'll go down . And then they 'll stay down .
ALISON: Just do n't say anything , okay ? Please do n't say anything .
WARDROBE LADY: I wo n't . Just tell them . They 'll be cool . Everybody loves somebody pregnant .
DEBBIE: Ooh . Did you see this sex offende website ? These are all the sex offenders in our neighborhood .
PETE: Looks like your computer has chicken pox .
DEBBIE: Those are sex offenders . These people live in our neighborhood .
PETE: We 'll skip their houses when we 're trick or treating . What do you want me to do ? Form a posse ?
TO BEN: Got your six-shooter on ya ? I got my lynching rope .
DEBBIE: You should n't take it so lightly .
PETE: I do n't take it lightly . I 'm not going to go over to any of these people 's houses and say , `` Hey , you mind ? Can you baby sit ? ''
DEBBIE: If I did n't care about these things , you would n't care about anything . Care more .
PETE: You 're so concerned with stuff , like do n't get them vaccinated , do n't let them eat fish . There 's mercury in the water . Jesus , how much `` Dateline NBC '' can you watch ?
DEBBIE: I know we 're supposed to be nice with each other right now , but I 'm having a eally hard time . I 'm struggling with it right now .
PETE: What am I doing ?
DEBBIE: Because I want to rip your fucking head off because you 're so fucking stupid ! This is scary .
PETE: I literally am at a point where I do n't know what I can say .
DEBBIE: So I 'm the bad guy because I 'm trying to protect our kids from child molesters and mercury ? And you 're cool ecause you do n't give a shit ?
PETE: Yeah .
DEBBIE: Yeah ? Is that it ?
PETE: Pretty much .
DEBBIE: God , you 're an asshole .
PETE: Do n't do this in front of Ben .

PETE: Sorry , Ben .
BEN: It 's okay . I did n't think she did , anyway . Alison enters .

DEBBIE: It 's Saturday .
PETE: I got to go .
DEBBIE: You do n't want to know the sex of the aby ? That 's no fun .
ALISON: Ben knows , but I 've sworn him to secrecy .
DEBBIE: I 'll get it out of him .
BEN: Hey . Think we 'll ever be as happy as Baby Bjorn couple is ?
ALISON: We are that happy .
BEN: Yeah . You look happy .
ALISON: Which is awesome . Because I never like guys like you . It 's great .
BEN: You keep saying that . I know .
DEBBIE: This is it . This is perfect .
BEN: Nice . Ben looks at the price tag .
TO DEBBIE: We can just borrow yours . Is that okay ?
DEBBIE: No . You need your own crib .
BEN: There 's one of these in an alley ehind my house . We could just gra that . Just rub Purell all over it .
DEBBIE: You know what ? Let me buy it . I need to get you a baby present anyway , and I would love to get it for you .
ALISON: No .

ALISON: Oh , shit .
GIRL #1: Alison !
ALISON: Hi !
GIRL #2: Oh , it 's so good to see you .
ALISON: You too . Oh , my God .
GIRL #2: We 've been watching you on E ! It 's the coolest thing .
ALISON: Yeah , it 's been super-exciting , just crazy busy . I 'm so sorry I have n't called .
GIRL #2: Oh , it 's fine .
TO BEN: Hi , I 'm Ashley .
ALISON: This is my friend , Ben .
BEN: I 'm Ben .
GIRL #2: I went to school with Alison .
GIRL #1: So , okay , so is Debbie having anothe aby ?
BEN: No . Alison is .
GIRL #2: What ? ! I just saw you a couple months ago . You 're pregnant ?
ALISON: It was a big surprise .
BEN: It 's a really funny story , actually , if you guys , if you got a second to hear it .
ALISON: It 's not really funny .
GIRL #1: Tell us .
ALISON: It 's not funny .
BEN: Let them be the judge , okay ? I think it 's funny .
ALISON: All right .
BEN: You know they say do n't drink and drive ?
GUY #1: Right .
BEN: Do n't drink and bone !
GIRL #2: Wow .
BEN: Yeah , she was acting weird and I eally think it 's just because I have n't made an honest woman out of her . She 's carrying my bastard child . No one wants that .
PETE: That 's what I did . I married Debbie when she got pregnant .
BEN: You think she 's , like , hiding me ? Like , she 's , like , embarrassed by me or something like that ?
PETE: Probably . I 'd hide you .
BEN: How much do wedding rings cost ?
PETE: It really depends , you know ? I think you 're supposed to spend three months pay on a ring .
BEN: That 'll be easy . I do n't make any money .
PETE: Really ? I thought there was a lot of money in porn .
BEN: God , it 's not porn ? All we do is we show you what nude scenes are in what movies .
PETE: Like Mister Skin ?
BEN: Who 's Mister Skin ?
PETE: Dude , Mister Skin . Pete imitates the Mister Skin logo smile .
JONAH: We 've wasted fourteen months of ou lives .
BEN: This is exactly the same as our site . How the fuck did this happen ?
JONAH: Mister Skin ! That 's even a better name than ours !
MARTIN: Well , fuck me in the beard .
JASON: Dude , they got the top ten group shower scenes ! Why did n't you think of that , Jay !
JAY: Do n't put this on me !
BEN: God damn it !
MARTIN: Well shit . I saw it online at one point , but I guess I did n't connect the dots .
JONAH: What are we gon na do now ?
BEN: All we need to do is think of a new , etter idea that no one else has thought of already .
JASON: `` Spiderman Three '' starts in eight minutes .
JONAH: Shit . Do n't worry . We 'll figure it out .
BEN: You know what ? Just because this site exists does n't mean ours wo n't work . Good things come in pairs .
JAY: For sure .
BEN: `` Volcano , '' `` Dante 's Peak . '' `` Deep Impact , '' `` Armageddon . '' `` Wyatt Earp , '' `` Tombstone . ''
JAY: Panda Express , Yoshinoya Beef Bowl .
BEN: Exactly . We can work together . This helps us , if anything .
JAY: We 're golden .
BEN: Alison , I 'm sure this is n't how you pictured it being exactly and it 's not how I wanted it . That is why I 'm presenting you with this empty box . It 's a promise , Alison . A promise that one day I will fill this with a ring that you deserve , a beautiful ring . I ca n't afford it yet . I 've picked it out , though . It 's at De Beers and it 's eally nice . So , basically , I 'm asking you , will you marry me ? Because I 'm in love with you .
ALISON: I love you too .
BEN: Really ? That 's so nice to hear . That 's the first time a girl 's ever said that to me .
ALISON: But here 's the thing .
BEN: There 's a thing ?
ALISON: I do n't really know yet what that love means . It 's so new and it 's so exciting . It 's great . I do n't know . We 've only known each other fo seventeen weeks .
BEN: Look , I thought you felt weird that we 're having a baby and we 're not engaged . I 'm going to get off my knee . It hurts . Ben sits next to Alison on the bed .
ALISON: I 'm okay with that . We 're just doing what we can . I do n't want us to put any more pressure on ourselves than we have .
BEN: That makes sense .
ALISON: I did n't hurt your feelings , did I ?
BEN: No . I just wanted to do right by you . If you do n't want to , that 's totally cool .
ALISON: I really do love you .
BEN: I know . Thanks . You mentioned that . It 's nice .
ALISON: Ben proposed to me . He did . It was eally sweet . I feel a little bad . He was wearing this great button-down . He tucked it in . He got down on one knee . He did n't have an actual ring , though , just an empty box but he had this whole spiel about when he has the money , he 'll buy me the ring I deserve .
DEBBIE: The box was empty ?
ALISON: He ca n't afford a ring .
DEBBIE: So he got down on one knee and gave you an empty box ?
ALISON: Yes .
DEBBIE: I 'm sorry .
ALISON: Get over it . If you 'd been there , you would have cried .
DEBBIE: You need to train him . Oprah said that when two people meet they should point out each other 's differences and flaws .
ALISON: I thought you should love people fo who they are .
DEBBIE: You criticize them a lot , so they get so down on themselves they have to change .
ALISON: You do n't think that 's naggy ?
DEBBIE: In the end , they thank you for it .
ALISON: Why do you say that ?
DEBBIE: I think he 's cheating on me . He 's always going to business meetings at odd hours . Then I try to call him on his cell phone and he says he 's in bad cell phone reception areas when he 's in good reception areas .
ALISON: Maybe he 's working late . Maybe he 's trying to sign a new band . I ca n't imagine Pete doing that .
DEBBIE: There 's no part of you that thinks maybe he 's a dirty little scumbag ?
ALISON: No .
DEBBIE: I think he might be .
PETE: You 're not going to tell them ?
ALISON: No . I do n't have to . It 's illegal fo them to fire me over it . And I get three months maternity leave if I stay . So I 'm not going to tell them .
DEBBIE: Good plan .
PETE: I like it .
BEN: It 's a good plan until her wate eaks over Robert De Niro 's shoes . ( impersonating Robert De
NIRO: My shoes . There 's baby goo on them .
PETE: ( impersonating Robert De
NIRO: These shoes ? On these shoes ? Did you puke on my shoes ?
BEN: ( impersonating Robert De
NIRO: Is your water on my shoes ?
PETE: Is n't it weird , though , when you have a kid and all your dreams and hopes go ight out the window .
DEBBIE: What changed for you ? What went out the window ? You do everything exactly the same .
PETE: No , I love what I 'm doing . But say efore you 're married with children you want to live in India for a year . You can do it .
DEBBIE: You want to go to India ? Go to India ! Seriously .
PETE: Do you want to go to India ?
DEBBIE: No . You can go .
BEN: I get what he means . Honestly , when I found out about Ben motions towards Alison .
ALISON: What do you mean ?
BEN: Do n't look at me . We can talk about our fears here . If Doc Brown screeched up to you in the DeLorean and said , `` Alison , I got the car here . What do you want to do ? '' No part of you would think , `` Maybe I 'll go back to that night and put a condom on Ben 's dick ? '' You never got that flash ?
ALISON: No . What are you talking about ?
PETE: `` Where we 're going , we do n't need oads . ''
BEN: You would n't do that ?
ALISON: I do n't know who Doc Brown is . What are you talking about ?
BEN: Doc Brown is Christopher Lloyd . He invented the DeLorean time machine .
PETE: Everyone has a time machine image .
DEBBIE: I have a really good idea . Why do n't you two get in your time machine , go ack in time and fuck each other ?
PETE: Who needs a time machine ? Ben holds up his drink .
BEN: This is my time machine !
TO BEN: I 'll throw you in my DeLorean and gun it to 88 .
TO PETE: You are a funny motherfucker , man .
TO DEBBIE: How can you fight with him ? I just want to kiss his face . He 's cute .
TO BEN: I like the way you move .
BEN: This is fun ! We should do this more . This is the most fun I 've had in a eally long time .
ALISON: Come on , harder .
BEN: I ca n't .
ALISON: Why ? Just do it deeper .
BEN: I ca n't .
ALISON: Why ?
BEN: I 'll poke the baby if I go deeper .
ALISON: Just do it !
BEN: Please do n't yell at me .
ALISON: The doctor and Debbie said it 's fine . Come on ! Ben stops .
BEN: I 'm sorry , can we change positions ? I 'm going to crush the baby .
ALISON: That 's ridiculous !
BEN: No , it 's not . It has no shell .
ALISON: Millions of people have sex when they 're pregnant ! It just works !
BEN: I weigh over 200 pounds .
ALISON: Just get over it .
BEN: I ca n't do it . Can you just get on top ? All I can see if our baby , poked in the face by my penis .
ALISON: Trust me , you 're not even close . Okay , fine . Alison moves on top . Alison abruptly stops .
BEN: You look beautiful . Your chin looks so skinny .
ALISON: And my boobs are all like , squishy and they 're flopping around . I can feel it and it 's distracting . It 's all National Geographic .
WHISPERING: Do you want to do it doggie style ?
ALISON: No . I do not want you to fuck me like a dog .
BEN: I 'm not fucking you like a dog . It 's doggie style . It 's just the style . I 'm , it 's not like a dog . We do n't have to go outside or anything .
ALISON: Yeah .
BEN: Should I go slower ?
ALISON: Harder .
BEN: Just tell me when you 're close .
ALISON: Just go harder .
BEN: Okay .
ALISON: Keep going ! Ben recoils .
BEN: Oh , God . Oh , fuck !
ALISON: What happened ?
BEN: The baby . It kicked my hand .
ALISON: It always kicks .
BEN: No , no , no , no , no .
ALISON: It 's fine .
BEN: Not like this . No , this was a warning kick .
ALISON: Just keep going .
BEN: This was a bad kick .
ALISON: It 's fine ! It 's fine !
BEN: Look . My dick must be like an inch away from its face and it 's coming , just coming in at its face . What if it kicked because it did n't like it ? I ca n't do that to our baby . That 's the first thing it 's going to see .
ALISON: What are you talking about ?
BEN: It 's having the baby between us , it just makes it weird . I 'm sorry . It just freaks me out a bit . It 's a little weird .
ALISON: I have totally lost it now .
BEN: You 've totally lost it ?
ALISON: I 've lost it .
BEN: Okay .
ALISON: Great , you know what ? Just forget it .
BEN: Shit .
ALISON: Ben ?

MARTIN: Jodi ! I 'll protect you !
ALISON: Ben !
BEN: Oh , my God ! Oh , no ! Oh , no !
JAY: That was horrible ! That was so horrible .
JASON: You 're fine , man .
JAY: When will it be light out ?
JASON: Take it easy .
JAY: When will it be light out ?
JASON: Did anybody turn off the gas ?
MARTIN: I did n't do it .
JASON: Oh , motherfucker . Jason runs back to the house .
JONAH: Martin , this is my friend , Alex . She 's a pretty incredible person .
MARTIN: Nice to meet you .
JONAH: Whoa , whoa , whoa . Dude ! Not cool , Martin .
MARTIN: That 's , that was n't
JONAH: Hey , are you serious , Howard Hughes ?
JODI: What happened ?
MARTIN: Nothing . Nothing happened . Come on .
TO BEN: Where were you ?
BEN: Look , I forgot you were sleeping over . I 'm sorry okay ?
ALISON: Yeah , because you were getting high off your huge bong . How am I supposed to be comfortable with the idea that you can take care of me and the baby if you are always getting high ?
BEN: You want me to stop smoking pot ecause there 's an earthquake once every ten years ? That makes no sense , Alison . You 're being irrational . Just elax . We 're all scared . Oh , shit , the cops .
ALISON: What is this ?
BEN: It 's a ninja weapon . I hope this place does n't get condemned . That would suck .
ALISON: Hey it 's me .
BEN: You !
ALISON: Hi ! So , listen . Will you do me a big favor ? Debbie wants us to come ove and have dinner tonight . She thinks Pete is cheating on her .
BEN: Really ?
ALISON: Yeah . Well , she saw one of his e-mails and there 's an address . Ugh .
BEN: Oh , man . I do n't want to do that .
ALISON: Ben , come on .
BEN: He 's not cheating on her .
ALISON: How do you know ?
BEN: I just know .
ALISON: Are you sure ?
BEN: I 'm one hundred percent sure he 's not cheating .
ALISON: Are you really ?
BEN: No . It actually kind of makes sense that he would cheat .
ALISON: Why ?
BEN: Because Debbie 's a pain in the ass and Pete 's awesome ?
ALISON: Well , why do n't you just come ove then , and , we 'll just diffuse the situation a little ?
PETE: I 'm just saying the music industry is different now . Steely Dan would neve even have a chance .
BEN: Well , maybe it 's because Steely Dan gargles my balls .
PETE: They 're incredible .
BEN: They really are n't good , man .
PETE: Old Steely Dan .
BEN: If I ever listen to Steely Dan , I want you to slice my head off with an Al Jarreau LP .
PETE: I should get going . I 'm supposed to see this band tonight in Hollywood . Actually , they 're playing in Laurel Canyon , so I 'll call you because the eception 's terrible over there .
BEN: That 's true .
PETE: And I do n't want you to worry . I 'm just going to jump in the shower . It would be terrible if I smelled worse than the band .
DEBBIE: Okay . Have fun . Ben exits .
BEN: You guys are crazy . He 's acting totally normal and hilarious .
TO ALISON: She does n't have a gun , does she ?
ALISON: No . I do n't think so .
BEN: Oh , great .
DEBBIE: Why was the door unlocked ? Wait here .
BEN: I just feel bad for Pete .
ALISON: What ?
BEN: I feel like this is n't a good way to get caught cheating , it should n't be like this .
ALISON: Well , maybe he should have thought of that before he was cheating .
BEN: Pete !
ALISON: Stop it .
BEN: I coughed . What do you want from me ? Debbie checks upstairs .
DEBBIE: There 's nobody up there .
BEN: Thank you .
DEBBIE: I guess I was wrong .
BEN: I told you . Can we get out of here , please ?
ALISON: Yeah , come on . Let 's go . A MURMUR comes from a far room .
DEBBIE: Did you hear that ?
ALISON: What ?
BEN: I did n't hear anything .
ALISON: Come on .
PETE: Carlos Delgado .
DEBBIE: What is this ?
PETE: Debbie .
DEBBIE: What the fuck is this ?
PETE: It 's our fantasy baseball draft .
DEBBIE: Your fantasy what ?
PETE: It 's , it 's our draftfor fantasy aseball . I told you all about this . Got Matsui . Debbie turns and walks out of the room .
DEBBIE: What else have you been lying about ?
PETE: Nothing .
TO ALISON: That guy said , `` Do n't let the door hit you in the vagina on the way out . ''
DEBBIE: Where were you on Wednesday ?
PETE: I 'm going to be honest with you .
TO BEN: Yeah , I heard him .
TO ALISON: That was hilarious .
DEBBIE: That would be a good idea .
PETE: You 've been mad because I 've been working so much and I did n't want to upset you .
DEBBIE: I would n't be mad .
PETE: You would be .
DEBBIE: I do n't get mad .
PETE: It 's a fantasy baseball draft . I 'm not cheating or anything .
DEBBIE: No , this is worse .
PETE: How is this worse ?
DEBBIE: This is you wanting to be with you friends more than your family .
PETE: Look , the reason I make that up is ecause if I told you what I was eally doing , you would just get mad . So , you think I 'm seeing a band , I do my fantasy draft , and it 's win/win .
DEBBIE: Well , what did you do last Wednesday night when you said you went to see a and ?
PETE: I went to the movies .
DEBBIE: With who ?
PETE: By myself .
DEBBIE: What 'd you see ?
PETE: `` Spiderman Three . ''
DEBBIE: Why do you want to go by yourself ? Why did n't you ask me to go ?
PETE: Because I needed to get away , you know ? With work and you and the kids , sometimes I just need some time to myself .
DEBBIE: I need time for myself . I want time for myself , too . Debbie holds back tears .
PETE: It 's not that big of a deal .
THROUGH TEARS: I like Spiderman .
PETE: Okay , so let 's see `` Spiderman Three '' next week .
DEBBIE: I do n't want to go see it now .
PETE: Well
DEBBIE: I do n't want to have to ask you to ask me . I want you to just come up with it on your own .
PETE: What ? I do n't even know what to say . Uh , what do you want me to do ?
DEBBIE: You just think because you do n't yell that you 're not mean , but this is mean .
PETE: I 'm not being mean . I 'm being honest . You 're telling me I need to be honest .
DEBBIE: No , you 're not . You 're lying .
PETE: I 'm doing it because I need to keep my sanity a little bit .
DEBBIE: You know what ? I do n't want you at the house anymore . Okay ?
PETE: Come on . Debbie heads for the car .
BEN: Oh , shit , she 's coming back .
ALISON: I can not stop thinking about what an asshole Pete is .
BEN: That 's a little strong , I would say .
ALISON: Really ? Because that had to be one of the most selfish things I 've eve witnessed .
BEN: It 's understandable . I even think it 's kind of funny .
ALISON: What 's funny about it ?
BEN: Well , you wo n't laugh now , I would n't imagine , but you know , the situation .
ALISON: Is that what you think ?
BEN: Yeah .
ALISON: Is that what you want to do , Ben ?
BEN: I do n't even like baseball . I 'm just saying when you 're a guy and you have a family and you have responsibility , you lose that male camaraderie , and I get that . I totally understand where he 's coming from .
ALISON: Why do you guys always go to that place ? You miss male camaraderie . What do I give a shit ? Go hang out with your bearded freak friends . I do n't care . You want to hang out with guys that look like the Shoe Bomber , it 's all on you , man .
BEN: Well what the fuck am I supposed to say to that ?
ALISON: You should just support me ! You know , you should just support everything I say because at this juncture in my life , I 'm allowed to be wrong !
BEN: So if you 're wrong , I have to support it ?
ALISON: Yes !
BEN: I ca n't tell you that you 're acting like a lunatic ?
ALISON: Oh , that 's helpful . You have to do nothing !
BEN: I 've sacrificed a lot of shit to this !
ALISON: You are just fucking sitting there ! You have n't sacrificed anything !
BEN: I have .
ALISON: I 've had to sacrifice my job , my body , my youth , my vagina !
BEN: You 've sacrificed your vagina ?
ALISON: Yes ! It will never look the same afte this !
BEN: Well . Fine . I 'll pay for vaginal econstructive surgery .
ALISON: You ca n't pay for shit ! You can barely uy spaghetti .
BEN: You 're right . Fine !
ALISON: You know what ? Get out of the car .
BEN: Oh ! You know what ? Why do n't you not threaten me ? !

ALISON: You know what ? Maybe I should take my shoes off . Or my belt buckle . My belt uckle 's huge .
TO BEN: Are you fucking kidding me ?
BEN: Why do n't you take off your earrings , too ? They weigh about eighty pounds . They 're made out of moon rocks are n't they ?
ALISON: Do not make fun of me . Okay ? I am hormonal , I am terrified , and I am falling apart , so stop treating everything like it 's a big joke !
BEN: I 'm sorry you 're freaking out , but I just walked three fucking miles through Koreatown to get here . Sorry if I 'm trying to lighten the mood a little . The Nurse leaves .
ALISON: Well , do n't ! Okay ? ! You ca n't take anything seriously ! You did n't even ead the baby books .
BEN: I did n't read the baby books ! What 's gon na happen ? How did anyone ever give irth without a baby book ? !
ALISON: It just shows your lack of commitment , Ben ! That you 're not in this with me !
BEN: Did you just say my lack of commitment ? Because that 's what it sounded like . It almost seems as though you forgot I proposed to you like an asshole ! And you said no to me !
ALISON: If you feel that way , you should just go . Really . Just go . Because we did n't mean to do this together , okay ? And , and we tried to make it work and that was good , I suppose . Alison holds back tears .
BEN: You know what ? I know this is n't you talking , it 's your hormones , but I would just like to say , `` Fuck you , hormones ! You are a crazy bitch , hormones ! Not Alison ! Hormones ! '' Fuck them . It 's a girl . Buy some pink shit !
ALISON: Nice . You are such an asshole . You know what ? Go fuck your fucking bong , you fuck !
BEN: I will fuck my bong . Doggie-style , fo once .
ALISON: I 'm really sorry about all that . That was really inappropriate .
BEN: I totally know what you 're talking about , man . If I wrote out the list of shit Alison does n't let me do it would e endless . Do n't smoke pot . Do n't have samurai swords in your room . Do n't have illegal grow operations in the house . I could go on all fucking day . Have I told her to stop doing anything ever ? No .
PETE: Marriage is like that show `` Everybody Loves Raymond , '' but it 's not funny . All the problems are the same , but it 's Instead of all the funny , pithy dialogue , everybody 's just eally pissed off and tense . Marriage is like an unfunny , tense version of `` Everybody Loves Raymond , '' but it does n't last twenty-two minutes . It lasts forever .
BEN: Let 's get out of here , man . Honestly , let 's just go . Let 's go to Vegas .
PETE: Let 's do it .
BEN: Yeah .
PETE: Why not ?
DEBBIE: Get up .
ALISON: What ?
DEBBIE: We 're not going to do this . Seriously . Debbie turns off the television .
ALISON: What are you doing ?
DEBBIE: We have to do something ! And have fun !
ALISON: I 'm just so tired .
DEBBIE: I know you 're tired . But we 're going to be untired ! We 're going to go live !
ALISON: Ugh . I hate you so much sometimes .
DEBBIE: We 're going to be positive .
ALISON: How many Red Bulls have you had ?
DEBBIE: I 've had about three Red Bulls in the last fifteen minutes . And I feel fabulous ! We 're going to create a new life and it 's going to be awesome ! Let 's go !
BEN: Since when do we lock this fucking thing ? Come on !
JASON: Yo . We ca n't go , dude . Sorry .
BEN: Holy crap ! What happened ?
JONAH: We got pink eye .
BEN: What ? You giving each other butterfly kisses or something ?
JASON: Very funny . That 's not how you get pink eye . You get it from poo particles making their way into you ocular cavities .
JAY: Hey , Ben .
BEN: Yo .
JAY: How 's it going ? I farted on Jason 's pillow as a practical joke . He farted on Jonah 's , thinking it was mine . And then eventually pink-eyes my pillow . I 'm not proud of this . But , I think we 've all forgiven each other . But , we ca n't go anywhere .
PETE: You can get pink eye from farting in a pillow ?
JONAH: Totally .
PETE: That 's awesome .
JONAH: Yeah , but you got to be bare-assed .

PETE: This is great . We 're going to have the est time ever .
BEN: We make a good team , man .
PETE: Yep . It 's like I ca n't come here with Debbie . She does n't understand . It 's like she wants to hold me in , and she was telling Alison she could train you .
BEN: She thinks she could train me ?
PETE: Yeah , like you 're running the Triple Crown .
BEN: She ca n't train this ! I 'm like Siegfried and Roy 's Bengal . You think I 'm trained . I 'll bite your fucking face off .
PETE: That 's right .
BEN: In front of a crowd , baby .
PETE: This is better . Besides I do n't know if I have enough of these babies to go around . Pete brandishes a bag of mushrooms .
BEN: Oh , my God . Are these mushrooms ?
PETE: I got them from a roadie for the Black Crowes .
BEN: I 'm eating them .
PETE: Oh , no , save it ! I got tickets to Cirque du Soleil .
BEN: You do ? ! No you do n't .

DOORMAN: Yeah , but maybe you should listen to your friend .
DEBBIE: No , you do n't need to call me sweetie .
DOORMAN: All right , you want to come in , you 're going to have to go to the end of the line and wait like everybody else .

DEBBIE: What ?
DOORMAN: You old . She pregnant . Ca n't have a unch of old , pregnant bitches running around . That 's crazy . I 'm only allowed to let in five percent black people . He said that . Five percent . That mean if there 's twenty-five people here , I get to let in one-and-a-quarter black people . So I got to hope there 's a lack midget in the crowd .
DEBBIE: Now I feel guilty . I 'm sorry .
DOORMAN: Why y'all want to be in here anyway ? Y'all need to be at a yoga class o something .
REGARDING ALISON: What the fuck is she doing at the club ? That 's not even good parenting ight there . Your old ass should know etter than that .
DEBBIE: Oh , God . Ugh . Debbie takes Alison away .
BEN: Have the mushrooms kicked in yet ? Ben and Pete CHUCKLE uncontrollably .

PETE: Right on . Ben hands Pete his gift for Sadie .
BEN: It 's a doll .
PETE: Thanks , Ben .
ALISON: I just do n't think we can make it work .
BEN: We can get back on track and everything 's going to be great .
ALISON: You 're just being nice . And I 'm being nice and just because we 're two nice people does n't mean we should stay together . I do n't want this baby to determine the rest of our lives . You know ? Me not wanting to do this alone is n't enough of a reason to drag you into a relationship with me . It 's just not fair . And , and do n't repeat this , ut , God , I do n't want to end up like Debbie .
BEN: But Debbie 's happy .
ALISON: She 's happy today . But every day is a constant struggle for them because they 're not right for each other . You know ? And they have to force it and I do n't want us to have to do that . I do n't want to force you to be what I think you should be . That 's wrong of me because you 're great . You really are .

BEN: Alison . What is this , like a wate irth ? What are we doing ? Should we go ?
ALISON: Shh ! Just relax , okay ? Just be mellow , ecause that 's what this is all about . Because if it gets too stressful in here then the baby is born into a stressful environment and then he 's wired for stress for the rest of his life . So justjust be calm .
WHISPERING: Okay . Okay . Let 's relax . Do you want to talk about things ? I feel really ad about a lot of the shit I did . I ca n't believe I said some of that . That 's all I think about in my head .

ALISON: I can do that .

BEN: That 's a good point . Have you had , have you had your bloody show ?
ALISON: What 's that ?
BEN: It 's a bloody mucusy discharge . But it only comes out right before the baby 's going to come , so if that has n't happened , we have time . We can make it to the hospital . It 's no problem .
ALISON: You read the baby books .
BEN: Yeah . I did . I read three of them , actually .

THELMA: Look , Ted , all I –
TED: I came home tonight . We just got the Fire and Ice account at the agency . Do you know what that means ? ! Do you understand what that means ? It means that it was maybe one of the five est days in my whole life .
THELMA: Ted , all I wanted to know was where
TED: I walk in the house and before I can say `` How are you ? `` , `` Did you have a nice day ? '' before I can say anything . Pow she 's out the door .
THELMA: OhmyGod . Did n't she say anything ? She must 've said something .
TED: Yeah , she said it was n't any use talking anymore .
THELMA: Ted , do n't be so hostile .

TED: Listen , Joanna Kramer 's got a goddamn good life . She 's got a husband that loves her . She 's got a terrific kid . She 's got a wonderful home –
THELMA: What d'you know about how Joanna felt ? You went off to an office every morning and you 'd come dragging home at seven or eight every night and as long as dinner was on the table you thought everything was swell .

THELMA: Oh for shit 's sake , Ted , you are the most selfish human being I have eve met . No wonder she said you came first , then Billy , then , if there was anything left over , she got the scraps .
TED: Joanna said that ? Thelma nods .

THELMA: Ted , divorce is a terrible thing . I know , I went through it . You 've got to believe I did everything I could to get Joanna to stay . But I 'll tell you something . You may not want to hear it , but it took a lot of courage for Joanna to do what she just did .

TED: Okay , Jim . Here 's the report on He stops in mid-sentence , looks around .

TED: I do n't . Jim , this is n't anything like what we talked about . It 's not even close .
MURRAY: Ted , basically it 's still you concept .

TED: What ? ! ? Phyllis nods .
PHYLLIS: You want to know why ? I 'll tell you why Another scotch and soda for the gentleman . I 'll tell you exactly why . Because you 're not his buddy anymore . Because he ca n't count on you to sit around the office every night until eight or nine and shoot the shit with him .
TED: I ca n't . I 've got Billy to take care of .
PHYLLIS: You dope . O'Connor does n't give a damn about Billy . All he wants is somebody that 'll hang around with him every night so he wo n't have to go home .
TED: I do n't believe you .
PHYLLIS: All right . Okay . But tell me something , Kramer . Who do you think is palling around with O'Connor these days ? Ted shrugs .
TED: How should I know ?
PHYLLIS: Murray .
TED: So what 's so terrible about that ?
PHYLLIS: Oh , for God 's sake , Kramer . You have got to be the world 's most naive human being . Murray has gone in and changed every single ad you 've done on the entire Fire and Ice campaign . Every layout Every idea Every single thing , ight down the line .
TED: No . No , I do n't believe it . Jim O'Connor would never let anything like that happen . He gave me my shot in this business . If it was n't fo Jim O'Connor I 'd be – I do n't know where I 'd be . He 's a wonderful man
PHYLLIS: Kramer , I 'm sorry . All I was trying to do was –

O'CONNOR: Well , ah I thought it over and I decided we 're doing it Murray 's way .
TED: Jim , this is garbage . This is n't anything like what we talked to Revlon about . None of it . You ca n't –
O'CONNOR: That 's my decision , Ted and that 's final .
BILLY: What is it ?
TED: Salisbury steak .
BILLY: I hate it .
TED: You do n't hate it . We had Salisbury steak last week and you liked it fine .
BILLY: No I did n't . I hate the brown stuff . It 's gross .
TED: All it is is onions and gravy .
BILLY: I 'm allergic to onions .
TED: You are not allergic of onions . You 've had them lots of times .
BILLY: I want a pizza .
TED: No . This is fine . Just take a bite , you 'll like it fine .
BILLY: I think I 'm going to throw up .
TED: Oh , for God 's sake Here .
BILLY: Some of the brown stuff is still there .
TED: Then eat around it .
BILLY: No .
TED: Now listen to me , young man . Do you know what I had to go through to put this goddamn food on the goddamn table ?
BILLY: I do n't care . I hate it . I want pizza .
TED: Not on your life . That 's it . I 've had it with crap around this house . From now on , no more pizza ! Get it ? Starting right now you can eat real food like a normal human being !

TED: Yeah ?
BILLY: I 'm sorry
TED: That 's okay , pal . Go back to sleep . It 's very late . He starts to get up , when
BILLY: Daddy ?
TED: Uh huh ?
BILLY: Are you gon na go away ?
TED: Of course I 'm not going away . I love you very much . I 'll be right here . There is a beat of silence , then
BILLY: That 's why mommy left is n't it ? 'Cause I was bad The boy begins to weep .
TED: Oh , Christ Oh , Christ No , pal . Your mom loves you very much . The reason she left did n't have anything to do with you . Look , I do n't know if this will make any sense to you , okay ? But I 'll try and explain . You see the reason you mom left was because Well , I guess it was because I kept trying to make her into a certain kind of person Make her be the way I thought a wife was supposed to be . Only she was n't like that . She was Well , she was n't like that . And now , when I think about it , I can see she tried very hard to be like I wanted – very hard . And when she could n't , then she tried to tell me about it . Only I would n't listen . I guess I thought that if I was happy , that meant she was happy too . Only she was n't . The truth is , the only reason she did n't leave a lot sooner was ecause she loves you so much . Joanna stayed until she could n't stand me any longer and then she left But it was n't you , pal . It was n't you .
BILLY: Is mom ever coming back ?
TED: You mean for good ? Billy nods .
BILLY: Oh Ted gets to his feet , starts for the door .
TED: Now go to sleep . It 's very late .
BILLY: Good night .

BILLY: Daddy , look ! Presenting Billy Kramer 's Fantastic Superjet !

SURGEON: There . That was n't so bad , was it ? Billy does n't say anything .
SURGEON: But I 'm going to have to take some stitches .
TED: How many ?
SURGEON: Ten .
TED: No .
SURGEON: Mr. Kramer , there 's –
TED: Fuck you . He 's my son . I 'm staying with him .

TED: Thel , listen to me . If , on the million to one shot that I should – That anything should happen to me . Would you take care of Billy ?

Then all of a sudden , I was a thirty- two-year-old , highly neurotic woman who had just walked out on her husband and child . I went to California ecause that was about as far away as I could get . Only I guess it was n't far enough . So I started going to a shrink . Ted , I 've had time to think . I 've een through some changes . I 've learned a lot about myself .
TED: Such as ? Silence .
JOANNA: I 've learned that I want my son .
TED: Joanna , go be a mother . Get married , have kids . Do n't get married , have kids . Do whatever you want . I do n't give a damn . Just leave me out of it – and leave my baby out of it .
JOANNA: Ted , if you ca n't discuss this ationally -
TED: Joanna , go fuck yourself !
TED: Look , she walked out on her own child , ight ? That 's desertion , right ? Mr. Shaunessy , I 'm telling you it 's an open and shut case .
SHAUNESSY: First , there 's no such thing as an open and shut case . Especially where custody is involved . Got it ? Ted nods .
SHAUNESSY: That 's if we win . If we lose , you could end up having to pay your wife 's court costs as well .
TED: Fine .
SHAUNESSY: Good . You 've hired yourself a hell of a lawyer , Mr. Kramer . How old is the child ?
TED: Six .
SHAUNESSY: That 's tough . In most cases involving a child that young , the court tends to side with the mother .
TED: But she signed over custody . Here
SHAUNESSY: I 'm not saying we do n't have a shot , ut it wo n't be easy Mr. Kramer , do me a favor . There is something I find very helpful in matters like this . I sit down and make a list of all the pros and cons on an issue . I actually write them down and look at them . I want you to do that , okay ? Then , after that , if you 're really sure you want to retain custody of your child – then we 'll go in there and whip their asses .
TED: I love you Billy Kramer .
BILLY: I love you too daddy .
TED: Sleep tight . Do n't let the bedbugs ite
BILLY: See you in the morning light
O'CONNOR: Look , ah Ted . I just got word from the guys at Revlon and ah they did some marketing tests on ou campaign and the results were
TED: Are you firing me , Jim ?
O'CONNOR: C'mon , Ted , do n't get emotional . Okay ? Look , this is n't exactly an easy thing for me to do , y'know ? I swea Murray and I did everything we could , ut those sons of bitches were out for blood . I mean it was all I could do to keep the account inside the shop Look , I promise , if I hea of anything I 'll let you know first thing . Ted , I want – O'Connor looks around .
O'CONNOR'S VOICE: Ted ?
TED: What ? ! What do you mean , I do n't understand .
TED: Uh , huh ?
SECRETARY'S VOICE: Mr. Kramer ? Please hold for Mr. Shaunessy Then , a moment later
SHAUNESSY'S VOICE: Ted ? They 've set the court date . I just heard today It 's January sixth .
TED: Oh , Christ.. .John , there 's some- thing I ought to tell you . My ah , situation has changed . I lost my job . There is a long pause , too long .
SHAUNESSY'S VOICE: Ted , I wo n't lie to you , we do n't have a hope in hell of winning a custody hearing if you 're out of work .
TED: Good Christ , Joanna , just get the hell out of my life .
SHAUNESSY'S VOICE: Ted ? Are you there ?
TED: Yeah .
SHAUNESSY'S VOICE: Any prospects ?
TED: Do n't worry . I plan to have something within twenty-four hours , John .
SHAUNESSY'S VOICE: How the hell are you going to do that ?
TED: I do n't know .
TED: I need a job , now .
ACKERMAN: Well , Mr. Kramer , I must say this has been very impressive . I 'd like to think about it and get back to you .
TED: Mr. Ackerman , is there anyone else that I should see before you come to a decision .
ACKERMAN: Mr. Spencer , our Advertising Director .
TED: Could I see him right away ?
ACKERMAN: I 'm sorry , but he 's leaving this evening for a two-week vacation . I 'll set up something the moment he gets back .
TED: I 'd like to see him now – before he leaves .
ACKERMAN: Mr. Kramer , I do n't think –
TED: I want this position very much .
ACKERMAN: Wait here . He turns and goes out the door .
SPENCER: So you 're the go-getter . All right , you 've got ten minutes .
TED: Excuse me , I believe you said I had ten minutes .
SPENCER: Well ?
TED: That means I 've got two minutes left . I understand you 're paying twenty- five . Spencer nods .
SPENCER: Mr. Kramer , can we talk privately for a moment ?
TED: Certainly .
ACKERMAN: Mr. Kramer ?
SPENCER: Welcome aboard , Mr. Kramer .
TED: Well , gentlemen , I 'm pleased to be with you .
TED: Merry Christmas .
TED: You 're a terrific kid , Billy Kramer .
TED'S VOICE: Hello ?
SHAUNESSY'S VOICE: Ted ? John Shaunessy here . I just got a call from your wife 's lawyer . She wants to see the kid .
TED: What ? ! She wants what ? !
SHAUNESSY'S VOICE: She 's the mother . That means she 's within her legal rights .
TED: John , what if she kidnaps him . I 've heard all these –
SHAUNESSY: Look , Ted , I do n't honestly think she would go to the trouble of suing you for custody of the child if she was planning on kidnapping him .
TED: I do n't know , John I mean , to be utally honest , I 'm not so sure what kind of mental shape Joanna 's in right now . Y'know she admitted she was seeing a shrink .
SHAUNESSY'S VOICE: You ever see her talk to the walls ?
TED: No , but –
SHAUNESSY'S VOICE: Then you do n't have a choice . Have Billy at the Seventy-Fifth Street entrance to Central Park , Saturday at ten .
BILLY: Mommy !
JOANNA: Oh , Billy Oh my Billy Oh my son
JOANNA: I 'll have him back at six . And they start off in the opposite direction .
TED: So , naturally , you assume that since Joanna left , that would be a compelling point against her , right ?
PHYLLIS: Right .
TED: But it does n't work that way . A majo decision was handed down by the Appellate Court in 1969 – in the case of Haskins vs. Haskins .
PHYLLIS: Kramer –
TED: Now in Haskins vs. Haskins the court uled in favor of the mother , thus establishing a precedent for awarding the child to the mother even though she previously abandoned the baby .
PHYLLIS: Kramer There 's something I ought to tell you .
TED: Yeah ?
PHYLLIS: I 've been offered a job in Washington with H.E.W .
TED: And ?
PHYLLIS: I 'm going to take it .
TED: But it 's not a year from now , is it ?
PHYLLIS: I 'll miss you , Kramer
ALVAREZ: Mr. Kramer ?
TED: Yes ?
ALVAREZ: I 'm Dr. Alvarez , Judge Atkins asked me to look in on your son and prepare an evaluation sheet .
TED: Oh , yes . Wo n't you come in .
ALVAREZ: Where is the child ?
TED: He 's in his room , playing .
ALVAREZ: Good . I 'll see him in there .
TED: Doctor , I attempt to conduct my social life discreetly . At the moment I am seeing no one .
ALVAREZ: Does that distress you ?
TED: Not particularly .
ALVAREZ: What does ?
TED: The prospect of losing my child .
ALVAREZ: Very well , I 'd like to see him if I may .
TED: Billy . This is Dr. Alvarez . She would like to talk to you .
BILLY: Sure .
DR. ALVAREZ: I 'd like to talk to Billy privately .
TED: Oh , yeah
TED: See . That 's my name .
BILLY: It 's my name too .
TED: Right . As he opens the door
BILLY: Wow !
TED: You like it ?
BILLY: Wow ! Is this really where you work ?
TED: Yep .
BILLY: Is that really your chair ?
TED: Uh huh
BILLY: Wow ! That 's neat . Can I sit in it ?
TED: Sure .
BILLY: Did mommy ever see this ?
TED: No , she never did .
BILLY: Are you going to get remarried ?
TED: I do n't know . I had n't thought much about it .
BILLY: Are you going to remarried Phyllis ?
TED: No .
BILLY: Will you and mommy get remarried ?
TED: No , son . Daddy and mommy will neve get remarried .
BILLY: Boy , I bet you if mommy ever saw this she 'd remarried you .
CLERK: Oyez , oyez The third Circuit Court of the State of New York , Judge Atkins presiding is now in session . All ise
GRESSEN: Your honor . As our first witness I would like to call Joanna Kramer .
SHAUNESSY: Real direct . Motherhood They 're going right for the throat .
GRESSEN: Now then , Mrs. Kramer , would you tell the court how long you were married ?
JOANNA: Six years .
GRESSEN: And would you describe those years as happy ?
JOANNA: The first couple , yes , but afte that it became increasingly difficult .
GRESSEN: Mrs. Kramer , did you ever work in a job while you were married to you ex-husband ?
JOANNA: No , I did not .
GRESSEN: Did you wish to ?
JOANNA: Yes . I tried to talk to Ted – my ex- husband – about it , but he would n't listen . He refuses to discuss it in any serious way . I remember one time he said I probably could n't get a job that would pay enough to hire a aby-sitter for Billy .
GRESSEN: Tell me , Mrs. Kramer , are you employed at the present time ?
JOANNA: Yes , I work for Jantzen as a sportswear designer .
GRESSEN: And what is your present salary ?
JOANNA: I make thirty-one thousand dollars a year .
GRESSEN: Mrs. Kramer , do you love your child ?
JOANNA: Yes . Very much .
GRESSEN: And yet you chose to leave him ? There is a long pause , then
JOANNA: Yes Look , during the last five years we were married , I had I was getting more and more unhappy , more and more frustrated . I needed to talk to somebody . I needed to find out if it was me , if I was going crazy or what . But every time I turned to Ted – my ex-husband , he could n't handle it . He became very I do n't know , very threatened . I mean , whenever I would bring up anything he would act like it was some kind of personal attack . Anyway , we became more and more separate more and more isolated from one another . Finally , I had no other choice , I had to leave . And because of my ex- husband 's attitude – his unwillingness to deal with my feelings , I had come to have almost no self-esteem At the time I left , I sincerely elieved that there was something wrong with me – that my son would be etter off without me . It was only when I got to California and started into therapy I began to realize I was n't a terrible person . And that just because I needed some creative and emotional outlet other than my child , that did n't make me unfit to e a mother .
GRESSEN: Your honor , I would like to place in evidence a report on Mrs. Kramer 's therapy by her therapist , Dr. Elinore Freedman of La Jolla , California .
JOANNA: Because my son is here . And his fathe is here . As a mother , I do n't want my child to be separated from his father .
GRESSEN: Mrs. Kramer , can you tell the court why you are asking for custody ? There is a pause , then
JOANNA: Because he 's my child Because I love him . I know I left my son , I know that 's a terrible thing to do . Believe me , I have to live with that every day of my life . But just because I 'm a woman , do n't I have a right to the same hopes and dreams as a man ? Do n't I have a right to a life of my own ? Is that so awful ? Is my pain any less just because I 'm a woman ? Are my feelings any cheaper ? I left my child – I know there is no excuse for that . But since then , I have gotten help . I have worked hard to ecome a whole human being . I do n't think I should be punished for that . I do n't think my son should be punished for that . Billy 's only six . He needs me . I 'm not saying he does n't need his father , but he needs me more . I 'm his mother . There is a beat of silence , then
GRESSEN: Thank you , Mrs. Kramer . I have no further questions .
SHAUNESSY: Now then , Mrs. Kramer , you said you were married seven years . Is that correct ?
JOANNA: Yes .
SHAUNESSY: In all that time did your husband ever strike you or abuse you physically in any way .
JOANNA: No .
SHAUNESSY: Did your husband strike or physically abuse his child in any way ?
JOANNA: No .
SHAUNESSY: Would you describe your husband as an alcoholic ?
JOANNA: No .
SHAUNESSY: A heavy drinker ?
JOANNA: No .
SHAUNESSY: Was he unfaithful ?
JOANNA: No .
SHAUNESSY: Did he ever fail to provide for you ?
JOANNA: No .
SHAUNESSY: Well , I can certainly understand why you left him .
GRESSEN: Objection .
SHAUNESSY: How long do you plan to live in New York , Mrs. Kramer ?
JOANNA: Permanently .
SHAUNESSY: Permanently ? Mrs. Kramer , how many boy friends have you had – permanently ?
JOANNA: I do n't recall .
SHAUNESSY: How many lovers have you had – permanently ?
JOANNA: I do n't recall .
SHAUNESSY: More than three , less than thirty- three – permanently ?
GRESSEN: Objection !
JUDGE: Overruled . The witness will answer , please .
JOANNA: Somewhere in between .
SHAUNESSY: Do you have a lover now ?
GRESSEN: Objection !
SHAUNESSY: Your honor , I would request a direct answer to a direct question . Does she have a lover ?
JUDGE: I 'll allow that . The witness will answer please .
JOANNA: Yes .
SHAUNESSY: Is that permanent ?
JOANNA: I I do n't know
SHAUNESSY: Then , we do n't really know , do we , when you say `` permanently '' if you 're planning to remain in New York , o even to keep the child for that matter , since you 've never really done anything in your life that was continuing , stable , that could be egarded as permanent .
GRESSEN: Objection ! I must ask that the counsel e prevented from harassing the witness .
JUDGE: Sustained .
SHAUNESSY: Mrs. Kramer , how can you conside yourself a fit mother when you have een a failure at virtually every elationship you have undertaken as an adult ?
GRESSEN: Objection !
JUDGE: Sustained .
SHAUNESSY: I 'll ask it another way . What was the longest personal relationship you have had in your life – othe than parents and girlfriends ?
JOANNA: Ah I guess I 'd have to say with my child .
SHAUNESSY: Whom you 've seen twice in a year ? Mrs. Kramer , your ex-husband , was n't he the longest personal relationship in your life ?
JOANNA: I suppose
SHAUNESSY: Would you speak up , Mrs. Kramer ? I could n't hear you .
JOANNA: Yes .
SHAUNESSY: How long was that ?
JOANNA: We were married two years before the aby . And then four very difficult years .
SHAUNESSY: So , you were a failure at the longest , most important relationship in you life .
GRESSEN: Objection !
JUDGE: Overruled .
JOANNA: I was not a failure .
SHAUNESSY: Oh ? What do you call it then – a success ? The marriage ended in divorce .
JOANNA: I consider it less my failure than his .
SHAUNESSY: Congratulations , Mrs. Kramer . You have just rewritten matrimonial law . You were both divorced , Mrs. Kramer .
GRESSEN: Objection !
SHAUNESSY: Your honor , I 'd like to ask what this model of stability and espectability has ever succeeded at ? Mrs. Kramer , were you a failure at the longest , most important personal elationship in your life ?
JUDGE: Please answer the question , Mrs. Kramer .
JOANNA: It did not succeed .
SHAUNESSY: Not it Not it , Mrs. Kramer – you . Were you a failure at the most important personal relationship of your life ?
JOANNA: Yes .
SHAUNESSY: No further questions .
TED: Jesus Christ . Did you have to be so ough on her ?
SHAUNESSY: Do you want the kid or do n't you ?
GRESSEN: Now then , Mr. O'Connor , how long did Ted Kramer work for you ?
O'CONNOR: Eight , almost nine years .
GRESSEN: And did you have a close personal elationship ?
O'CONNOR: Yes
GRESSEN: And how did you find his work ?
O'CONNOR: It was good . He was a hard worker , a lot of drive , a real hustler .
GRESSEN: And yet you fired him . There is a long pause .
O'CONNOR: Ted was a good worker . But , ah after his wife left him and he was taking care of the kid on his own , things started to change . Look , I know he had problems , I understand that . I 've got problems , everybody 's got problems . But I 've got a shop to un , I ca n't let that kind of thing get in the way I guess I felt that Ted was letting his duties at home interfere with his responsibilities in the office .
GRESSEN: Thank you . I have no furthe questions . Shaunessy stands up .
SHAUNESSY: Mr. O'Connor , does the agency still have the Fire and Ice account ?
O'CONNOR: No .
SHAUNESSY: Mr. O'Connor , can you tell me where you are employed at the moment ?
O'CONNOR: At the moment I am unemployed .
JUDGE: If the petitioner has no furthe witnesses , we will hear the respondent tomorrow morning at 9 30 .
BILLY: Mom – I mean , dad ?
TED: Uh , huh ?
BILLY: What did you do when you were little ?
TED: I guess about the same kind of things you do .
BILLY: Did you watch `` I Dream of Jeannie ? ''
TED: Uh , uh We did n't have television then .
BILLY: You did n't have T.V . ?
TED: Nope . It had n't been invented yet . He starts to go back to work .
BILLY: Was there apple juice when you were little ?
TED: Yeah , there was apple juice .
BILLY: Was there Burger King ?
TED: Uh , uh . There was no such a thing as Burger King .
BILLY: What else was n't there ?
TED: Well , let 's see There was n't McDonald 's . And there was n't astronauts And there was n't frozen yogurt . And there was n't As he continues on about what was n't , we
SHAUNESSY: Mrs. Phillips , how long have you known Ted Kramer ?
THELMA: Six years . Ever since Ted and Joanna moved into the building .
SHAUNESSY: How often do you see Mr. Kramer and his son ?
THELMA: Charley , my husband , and I are divorced and Kim , that 's our daughte is about Billy 's age and the children play together a lot . So , I guess we see each three or four times a week .
SHAUNESSY: Can you describe the relationship etween Mr. Kramer and his son ?
THELMA: It 's beautiful . It 's just beautiful . They have a beautiful relationship .
GRESSEN: Objection , your honor . The answe is , to be generous , very vague .
SHAUNESSY: Can you recall any particular incident that relates to Mr. Kramer 's care of his child ?
THELMA: Ted – Mr. Kramer , spends a great deal of time with his child . I do n't just mean hours , I mean good time , involved time . He reads to Billy . They play together . They talk all the time He is a very kind man a very devoted father , and and And Joanna if you ever saw them together there would n't be a trial at all Oh , shit I 'm sorry I 'm sorry
SHAUNESSY: No further questions . Thank you Mrs. Phillips .
GRESSEN: No questions .
SHAUNESSY: Mr. Kramer , would you tell the court exactly why you want to retain custody of your child .
TED: When Joanna – – my ex-wife – when she was talking efore about how unhappy she was during our marriage Well , I guess most of what she said was probably true . There were a lot of things I did n't understand – a lot of things I would do different if I could . Just like I guess there are a lot of things Joanna wishes she could change But we ca n't . Some things , once they are done , ca n't be undone . Joanna says she loves Billy . I believe she does . So do I . But the way it was explained to me , that 's not the issue . The only thing that 's supposed to matter here is what 's best fo Billy When Joanna said why should n't a woman have the same ambitions as a man , I suppose she 's ight . But by the same token what law is it that says a woman is a etter parent simply by virtue of her sex ? I guess I 've had to think a lot about whatever it is that makes somebody a good parent constancy , patience , understanding love . Where is it written that a man has any less of those qualities than a woman ? Billy has a home with me , I 've tried to make it the best I could . It 's not perfect . I 'm not a perfect parent . I do n't have enough patience . Sometimes I forget he 's just a little kid But I love him More than anything in this world I love him .
SHAUNESSY: Thank you , Mr. Kramer . No furthe questions .
GRESSEN: Mr. Kramer , by any chance have you ever had a woman in your bed while your child was asleep in the next oom ?
TED: I suppose .
GRESSEN: So do I .
SHAUNESSY: Objection !
JUDGE: Sustained .
GRESSEN: Mr. Kramer , is n't it true that you were fired from your last job not more than six weeks ago ?
TED: Technically , the agency lost a big account and seventy four people were let go . I was one of them .
GRESSEN: You were fired , correct ?
TED: Yes , but I 'm with J. Walter Thompson now . I do n't think that will happen again .
GRESSEN: Give them time
SHAUNESSY: Objection , your honor ! Counsel is harassing the witness .
GRESSEN: Your honor , I 'm only examining the man 's employment record . He pretends to fitness when he can not hold a job .
JUDGE: Sustained .
GRESSEN: Mr. Kramer , did your child nearly lose an eye when he was in your care ?
SHAUNESSY: Objection ! Your honor , counsel is aising a question that is not germane to these proceedings .
GRESSEN: While the child was in the care of the witness , he cut his face badly and is now scarred .
JUDGE: Are you introducing the question of negligence here , counselor ?
GRESSEN: Yes , your honor .
JUDGE: I see . Well , you 'll have to do bette than that . Do you have any affidavits to support negligence ?
GRESSEN: I do not , your honor , however –
JUDGE: This is an isolated incident , counselor , unless you can prove otherwise .
GRESSEN: Does the witness deny the injury took place ?
JUDGE: No , counselor , I 'm going to over- ule you on this line of questioning .
GRESSEN: Then I have concluded my questions .
JOANNA: I 'm sorry I just mentioned it in passing . I never thought he 'd use it .
TED: Yeah , well he did , did n't he .
JOANNA: Please , Ted . I never would have ought it up if I thought –
TED: I 'm not interested , Joanna . Goodbye .
THELMA: You heard anything yet ?
TED: Any day .
THELMA: Ted .
TED: Uh , huh
THELMA: Ah , Charley and I are Well , we 're thinking about I mean , actually we 're sort of talking about maybe getting back together .
TED: You and Charley ? Thelma nods .
THELMA: Maybe . I said maybe . What I mean is , ah I do n't think it 'll really work out , but Charley seems to want it , so
TED: C'mon . Billy , Kim . Let 's go .
TED: Well ?
TED: Oh , Christ !
SHAUNESSY: The judge went for motherhood straight down the line .
TED: I lost him ? I lost him ?
SHAUNESSY: I ca n't tell you how sorry I am .
TED: Oh , no..
SHAUNESSY: Ordered , adjudged and decreed that the petitioner be awarded custody of the minor child , effective Monday the 23rd of January . That the espondent pay for the maintenance and support of said child , fou hundred dollars each month . That the father shall have the following rights of visitation every other weekend , one night each week to be mutually agreed upon and one half of the child 's vacation period . That 's it .
TED: What if I fight it ?
SHAUNESSY: We can appeal , but I ca n't guarantee anything .
TED: I 'll take my chances .
SHAUNESSY: It 's going to cost .
TED: Do n't worry . I 'll get the money . There is a beat of silence , then
SHAUNESSY: I 've got to tell you something , Ted . This time it 'll be Billy that pays . This time I 'll have to put him on the stand .
TED: Oh , Christ no I ca n't do that . I just ca n't Excuse me I 'm sorry I just
THELMA: Ted ! It 's me Ted ? There is a beat of silence , then
BILLY: Daddy ! You 're home early . Did you get fired again ?
TED: No , son , I did n't get fired . I 'll tell you what we 'll do , okay ? How about if we go to a Burger King and then we watch a little T.V . and then we get packed to go to the country tomorrow . Just you and me How 'bout that ?
TED: Billy , sometimes when a mother and a father are divorced , there 's a discussion about who the child should live with , the mother or the father . Now there is a man who is very wise . He 's called a judge . And a judge has a lot of experience with divorces and he decides who it would be best for the child to live with .
BILLY: Why does he decide ?
TED: Because Well , that 's what he does . He 's a very powerful man .
BILLY: Like a principal ?
TED: Bigger than a principal . The judge sits in robes in a big chair The judge has thought a lot about us , about you and me and your mom , and he has decided he has decided that it would be est for you to live with your mom Joanna in her apartment . And I 'm very lucky . Because even though you 'll live with your mom Joanna I 'll get to see you once a week for dinner and a couple of weekends a month .
BILLY: I do n't understand , daddy .
TED: What do n't you understand , pal ?
BILLY: Where will my bed be , where will I sleep ?
TED: At your mom 's . She 'll have a bed fo you in your own room .
BILLY: Where will my toys be ?
TED: I 'll send your toys there and I 'm sure you 'll get some new ones .
BILLY: Who will read me my stories ?
TED: Your mom .
BILLY: Daddy , what if The Face comes when I 'm at mommy 's ?
TED: Your mom knows all about The Face , okay ? Do n't worry , she 'll tell The Face to beat it .
BILLY: Will you come and say good-night to me every night ? Suddenly Ted ca n't stand it any longer .
TED: Look , it 's getting cold . Why do n't you go inside where it 's warm . I 'll e along in a minute . Billy hangs back , watching Ted .
TED: Hey ? What 's doin ' with that bread ? Let 's see a little hustle around here .
TED: This is it , pal . Billy , fighting back tears , nods . Sound-effect The intercom buzzes again .
JOANNA'S VOICE: Ted , it 's Joanna . Can you meet me in the lobby ? Alone ? And she hangs up before he can answer .
TED: I 'll be back in a minute .
TED: Okay , I 'm here . Now why did you –
JOANNA: Ted , do you love him ?
TED: Goddamnit , Joanna . What the –
JOANNA: Ted , do you love him ? He nods .
TED: Joanna , what the hell is –
JOANNA: Please Please do n't stop me . This is the hardest thing I 've ever had to do..
JOANNA: After I left when I was in California , I began to think , what kind of mother was I that I could walk out on my own child . It got to where I could n't tell anybody about Billy – I could n't stand that look in their faces when I said he was n't living with me . Finally it seemed like the most important thing in the world to come back here and prove to Billy and to me and to the world how much I loved him And I did And I won . Only it was just anothe `` should . '' Sitting in that courtroom . Hearing everything you did , everything you went through Something happened . I guess it does n't matter how much I love him , or how much you love him . I guess it 's like you said , the only thing that counts is what 's best fo Billy . I do n't know , maybe that 's all love is anyway Ted , I think Billy should stay with you
TED: What ?
JOANNA: He 's already got one mother , he does n't need two He 's yours I wo n't fight you for him any more . He 's yours
TED: Oh , God Oh , my God
JOANNA: Only can I still see him ?
TED: No more waiting in Coffee Shops I promise .
JOANNA: Okay I think I 'll go talk to my son now . How do I look ?
TED: Beautiful .

SERVANT: Thank you .
LHAMO: Wait ! No ! The men stop . Lhamo runs to the Servant .
MOTHER: No , no , no . Lhasa ! He always says he will travel far away . He always wants to go .
SERVANT: We can not , young master .
LHAMO: You come back ? A pause .
SERVANT: We will . The travelers head down the road .
MOTHER: Say , Kumbum Monastery .
LOBSANG: Kumbum . It is not far away .
MOTHER: It is not far at all , and it is a beautiful place . And your big brother is abbott there . You will not be alone .
LOBSANG: I will be very smart .
MOTHER: You will be fine . You will be a fine monk .
LHAMO: Cow .
MOTHER: Yes . A cow had died . One night , you stopped all your moving , and I said to you sister , `` His time has come . ''
LHAMO: Me . First break of day .
MOTHER: At dawn , you were born . One eye was closed , and your sister opened it with her thumb . We gave you the sweet drink .
LHAMO: I pooped . His Mother laughs .
MOTHER: You did . We washed you and wrapped you in sheepskin and took you to you father . That day he father got ette And that day , a pair of crows came to nest in our roof . I just remembered .
LHAMO: I miss my brother .
MOTHER: I miss him too .
LAMA: I am the Lama of Sera .
MOTHER: Sera Monastery ? From Lhasa ?
LAMA: Yes . We have business here .
KEUSTANG RINPOCHE: This is yours , you say . What else belongs to you ?
MOTHER: My oldest boy is an incarnation .
KEUSTANG RINPOCHE: So is your youngest .
MOTHER: I will be back in a few days .
LHAMO: How many ?
MOTHER: Two . Lhamo holds up two fingers .
LHAMO: This many ?
MOTHER: Yes , yes . Your brothers are here .
CHINESE GOVERNOR: I want him accompanied by my Chinese soldiers .
KEUSTANG RINPOCHE: This is Tibet . We are not under your authority . CLOSE on the Chinese Governor .
CHINESE GOVERNOR: I want one hundred thousand Chinese dollars , if you want the oy . CLOSE on Keustang Rinpoche . Slowly , he nods .
MOTHER: But why ? Who is Lhamo ? Who do they say he is ? Her husband does not know .
TEACHER: `` May I be a bridge , a boat , a ship For all who wish to cross the water . '' Lhamo looks down at the complicated words .
LHAMO: You have all the room .
LOBSANG: Do n't be a baby , move over .
LHAMO: You move .
LOBSANG: You ! You think you are so ig !
LHAMO: Who am I ?
MOTHER: We do not know .
RETING RINPOCHE: Chenrezi , the Buddha of compassion . The Wish Fulfilling Jewel . The Fourteenth Dalai Lama .
MOTHER: Long life .
FATHER: Long life . Finally , Lobsang .
LOBSANG: Long life , Lhamo . We hear the sound of a great , Tibetan horn . We hear peels of childish laughter .
MONKS: Kundun ! Kundun !
RETING RINPOCHE: Centuries ago , a young boy was orn . His name was Gedundrub . The night of his birth , robbers came to his home and his family fled hiding the baby in a cattle pen . When they returned the next day , the baby was safe . They found him guarded by a pair of black crows . He was the first Dalai Lama . The Living Buddha of Compassion . Now , you have chosen to come back to this life once again . Reting blows his nose .
LORD CHAMBERLAIN: Fifth Dalai Lama . The boy looks .
LORD CHAMBBERLAIN: Seventh Dalai Lama . Tenzin Gyatso nods .
LORD CHAMBERLAIN: Thirteenth Dalai Lama . The boy looks at the photo .
NORBU THUNDRUP: My name is Norbu , Holiness . I will be good , you be bad .
TENZIN GYATSO: I 'm on a big mountain and hitting at the bad men . And after the game , we 're going to trade . You just stay over there , no , there ! , Norbu , and I will shoot at you . I want your land . I take it . I am stronger .
NORBU THUNDRUP: I am braver .
TENZIN GYATSO: I have more men . NORBU ThUNDRUP I have smarter men .
NORBU THUNDRUP: Today you lose . Tomorrow you may win . Norbu snaps his fingers .
TENZIN GYATSO: Why is your beard so funny ? Let me touch this . Tenzin touches the soft , bald , chin of Norbu .
LAYMAN: I believe that the Regent is asking for too high a reward for his part in finding the Dalai Lama . Too much money , too much land .
MONK: We note this . Now , the Chinese . There is audible expression of tension .
LAYMAN: We can not allow it . Right now , we have a only a small Chinese mission in Lhasa , the first since the Thirteenth Dalai Lama threw them out in 1912 . The road would increase the size of that mission . The Chinese would try to control our trade , as they did once before , control our contact with the outside world .
TENZIN GYATSO: What is it ?
THE ATTENDANTS: Ah , it is a telescope , Holiness . With this you can see a long way .
TENZIN GYATSO: And , is it mine ?
ATTENDANT: These are all gifts sent to your predecessors .
LOBSANG SAMTEN: Yes ! Then it is yours !
TENZIN GYATSO: I need it .
NORBU THUNDRUP: She carried a basket in her arms , a big , heavy basket , and the old monk cautiously approached . She opened her basket and showed what she had . Heads . Human heads . Only the heads .
TENZIN GYATSO: Is that true or pretend ?
NORBU THUNDRUP: It is a story , you decide .
TENZIN GYATSO: Pretend .
NORBU THUNDRUP: As you say .
TENZIN GYATSO: `` I be an island for those who seek one , a lamp for light . ''
NORBU THUNDRUP: You can only go with attendants and a ig ceremony .
TENZIN GYATSO: I want to run down the street . I want to buy a toy . Eat from the shops .
NORBU THUNDRUP: You can not .
TENZIN GYATSO: I want to be a shepherd , taking those goats and cows out to the hillside .
NORBU THUNDRUP: But you are not a shepherd , you are the Dalai Lama .
TENZIN GYATSO: Maybe in the next life , the world will not need a Dalai Lama . NORNU ThUNDRUP I would not know . Maybe .
LOBSANG SAMTEN: The Dalai Lama is not supposed to eat pork . It is not good fo your brain .
FATHER: I am sorry , Lhamo .
TENZIN GYATSO: It is alright , Father .
FATHER: Not the way to talk to people .
TENZIN GYATSO: Can I do anything I want ?
FATHER: No .
TENZIN GYATSO: But , I am in charge .
FATHER: Are you ? Of whom ? The boy thinks .
TENZIN GYATSO: Can I save the sheep from going to the market ? So they do n't die .
LOBSANG: You could buy them .
TENZIN GYATSO: Do I have money ?
LOBSANG: What do you think ?
TENZIN GYATSO: Do you have money ?
FATHER: I do , now .
TENZIN GYATSO: And you have horses ? You love horses .
FATHER: I do , beautiful horses . Thank you , Holiness .
TENZIN GYATSO: Will you buy the sheep for me ?
FATHER: Where will you keep them ?
TENZIN GYATSO: Here . We 'll collect them .
FATHER: I will buy them for you .
TENZIN GYATSO: Can I free the prisoners ?
FATHER: Hmmm .
LOBSANG: You ca n't do anything real until you are Dalai Lama .
TENZIN GYATSO: I am him .
LOBSANG: Not until you are eighteen .
FATHER: Sometimes you strike the goat , to scare the sheep .
LOBSANG: I am the goat . He is a naughty sheep .
FATHER: He will not be ours much longer . CLOSE on the Father 's face .
MOTHER: I have news . The Regent has resigned his post .
TENZIN GYATSO: Is he a bad man ? Norbu says he is `` lavish '' and `` willful '' . `` How can he give you monk 's vows if he has not kept them himself ? ''
MOTHER: Well , some say . It 's not for you to worry about . Another will be chosen .
TENZIN GYATSO: He was always nice to me . He found me . He saw me in his dreams .
MOTHER: I turn you over again , today , Lhamo . One day , you will not e able to come running to us .
TENZIN GYATSO: But you will always be here ?
MOTHER: Me ?
TENZIN GYATSO: You will always !
MOTHER: I have one more piece of news . A baby is coming .
TENZIN GYATSO: Oh , Mama ! Who will it be ?
MOTHER: Oh , no ! Who can it be ?
TENZIN GYATSO: My teeth ! My teeth are in here !
TAKTRA RINPOCHE: `` I take refuge in the three jewels , The Buddha , the Dharma and the Sangra . ''
TENZIN GYATSO: You recite ! You recite !
TAKTRA RINPOCHE: `` I take refuge in the three jewels , The Buddha , the Dharma and the Sangra . ''
TENZIN GYATSO: I would like you to be my new Regent . Taktra stops . He nods to the boy .
LING RINPOCHE: The Four Noble Truths .
TENZIN GYATSO: The Four Noble Truths , as taught by the Lord Sakyamuni Buddha are The Truth of Suffering The Truth of the Cause of Suffering , The Truth of the Cessation of Suffering , the Truth of the Way which leads to the cessation of Suffering .
LING RINPOCHE: I accept it . What is suffering ?
TENZIN GYATSO: True suffering arises from contaminated actions and afflictions . Birth , illness , grief , old age , poverty , pain , death - these are surferings .
LING RINPOCHE: I accept it . What are the causes of suffering ?
TENZIN GYATSO: The causes of suffering arise from true sources . Attachment , desire , envy , hatred , greed , unkindness , wrong view and so forth - these are some causes of suffering .
LING RINPOCHE: How does one progress from the realization of one Noble Truth to another ?
TENZIN GYATSO: We will have to think about that .
LING RINPOCHE: Answer . A pause , and then
TENZIN GYATSO: When one understands that he causes some of his own suffering , needlessly , then he looks fo the causes in his own life . And when and he looks for those causes , when he investigates , then he is putting confidence in his own ability to eliminate the sources and end the suffering . A wish to find a path to peace arises . For all beings desire happiness . All wish to find their purest selves . Ling nods in approval . He looks to the elders .
LING RINPOCHE: I accept it .
TAKTRA RINPOCHE: Careful ! Careful ! Tenzin Gyatso shouts
TENZIN GYATSO: I need to jump ! I love to jump !
ORACLE: Heed the warning of your predecessor . Or the war will end here .
TENZIN GYATSO: Oh , nicely done , Norbu . I will get you . The Lord Chamberlain enters .
LORD CHAMBERLAIN: May I listen to the news with you , Holiness ?
TENZIN GYATSO: Please .
LORD CPIAMBERLAIN: Roughly five thousand men .
TENZIN GYATSO: Is that big ?
LORD CHAMBERLAIN: No . Not very big .
TENZIN GYATSO: The Regent is adding men . And he bought rifles and ammunition from India . Mountain guns , too .
LORD CHAMBERLAIN: No . This war is almost over .
TENZIN GYATSO: Will we ever be in war ?
NORBU THUNDRUP: We have enemies .
TENZIN GYATSO: The Chinese .
NORBU THUNDRUP: Yes .
TENZIN GYATSO: But , surely , we are safe in Tibet . We do n't believe in killing .
LORD CHAMBERLAIN: No , we do n't .
TENZIN GYATSO: This is Britain .
NORBU THUNDRUP: Ahh .
TENZIN GYATSO: Where is Poland ?
LORD CHAMBERLAIN: In the Pacific Ocean . It is an island . American territory .
TENZIN GYATSO: Where is Alsace ?
LORD CHAMBERLAIN: I do not know , Holiness .
TENZIN GYATSO: This is Tibet . And this is China .
NORBU THUNDRUP: Ahh . They all look at huge China .
TENZIN GYATSO: Certainly , we are safe in Tibet . No one answers .
NORBU THUNDRUP: We hope , Kundun . Tenzin Gyatso turns to the Lord Chamberlain .
TENZIN GYATSO: What was the warning of the Thirteenth Dalai Lama ?
LORD CHAMBERLAIN: He warned about the future of Tibet .
TENZIN GYATSO: Tell me .
LORD CHAMBERLAIN: When it is time .
TENZIN GYATSO: Patience is the first of the Six Perfections .
LING RINPOCHE: `` To be born in a time when the Buddha has appeared . To be born in a time when the Buddha has taught . To be born when the teaching of Buddha is alive . ''
QUESTIONER: How is human life precious ?
LING RINPOCHE: As a result of previous karma , you have obtained this human life . By means of this rebirth , through work and study , you can attain all everlasting happiness . In the words of Shantideva `` With the boat of this precious life , You can cross the waters of Samsara . How rare to find this boat ! '' `` Oh , ignorant one , do not fall asleep now ! '' Shots ring out .
VOICES: Sera , Sera Monastery . Reting . Under arrest . The army is taking him right past Sera ! Monastery ! Those crazy monks ! Have een threatening trouble . Reting tried to assassinate Taktra Rinpoche .
TENZIN GYATSO: It 's the army , firing on Sera Monastery ! Oh , no ! Oh , no ! The shooting continues .
NORBU THUNDRUP: Reting Rinpoche has been arrested . He tried to overthrow Regent Taktra . Today , he is brought back to Lhasa by government officials . The monks at Sera Monastery have been on his side . Now , there is trouble between them and the army . The Lord Chamberlain arrives on the terrace .
LORD CHAMBERLAIN: I am sorry for you to have to witness this , Kundun .
TENZIN GYATSO: Look here !
LORD CHAMBERLAIN: Tragic . Unnecessary .
TENZIN GYATSO: What can I do ? I am only a boy .
LORD CHAMBERLAIN: You are the man who wrote this letter . You are the man who has come ack to lead us . You will soon have great responsibilities . You must know what to do .
NORBU THUNDRUP: You remember who you are . You called for them . Tenzin Gyatso enters the adjacent room .
TENZIN GYATSO: Taktra Rinpoche , I understand there was an attempt on you life .
TAKTRA RINPOCHE: It is possible , Holiness .
TENZIN GYATSO: You are unharmed ?
TAKTRA RINPOCHE: Completely .
TENZIN GYATSO: Good . Where is Reting Rinpoche now ?
KASHAG MEMBER: He has been imprisoned , here in the Potala , Holiness .
TENZIN GYATSO: The Sera monks have surrendered ?
KASHAG MEMBER: It is calm . The boy motions to the table .
TENZIN GYATSO: Please , have tea . The tea is poured .
LORD CHAMBERLAIN: Ask whatever you will .
TENZIN GYATSO: What is the danger from the Chinese , now ?
KASHAG MEMBER: Very complicated , Holiness . Let me tell you current news . The Chinese have launched a deceptive campaign aimed at convincing the world that Tibet belongs to China . We sent a mission to the Chinese National Conference . Our attendance was a grave mistake . The Tibetans were introduced as delegates from the `` Chinese region of Tibet '' . We protested this reference and demanded a letter rebutting it .
TENZIN GYATSO: Did you receive the letter ?
KASHAG MEMBER: We did not .
LORD CHAMBERLAIN: The war is over . This is a time in when nations are edefining themselves .
TENZIN GYATSO: So , Tibet , too , needs to define itself .
LORD CHAMBERLAIN: Yes . As a free country . But our attempts have proven futile . We continue to be adly outmaneuvered by the Chinese .
TENZIN GYATSO: Can India help us ?
LORD CHAMBERLAIN: India is a newly independent nation . They are struggling . India is in no position to help us .
TENZIN GYATSO: Britain ?
LORD CHAMBERLAIN: Britain chooses not to .
TENZIN GYATSO: And , America ?
LORD CHAMBERLAIN: America , we shall see .
TENZIN GYATSO: Ask the Chinese mission to leave our country . Immediately . A shocking suggestion .
LORD CHAMBERLAIN: Quite simple . Yes . Good .
TENZIN GYATSO: I shall send a letter to America , to the President , informing him of our problem . The men agree to this .
NORBU THUNDRUP: Reting Rinpoche has died in prison . Tenzin Gyatso lays down his pen .
LAYMAN: The Communist have control of China .
MONK: We can concede that Tibet is a part of China if we can guarantee that the Dalai Lama 's name and authority will remain
LAYMAN: And do you believe that the Tibetan government will be allowed to continue to function as it is ? Do you believe that our religion will be protected ?
VOICES: Give the Dalai Lama his majority !
MONK: We have dealt with this Chinese obsession for hundreds of years . We can deal with it now .
LAYMAN: These are not the Chinese we know . These are Communists .
VOICES: Make him Dalai Lama now !
TENZIN GYATSO: If we agree that we are part of China , nothing else will matter . Not trade , not defense . We will be lost .
TAKTRA RINPOCHE: What would you do , Holiness ? The boy looks out over the water .
TENZIN GYATSO: What should I do about my doubt , Teacher ?
TAKTRA RINPOCHE: It is a difficult situation .
TENZIN GYATSO: I mean , my doubt . Why me ? Am I Him ?
TAKTRA RINPOCHE: Doubt is an affliction . Reliquish it . Accept . Pause .
TENZIN GYATSO: I believe we must make no concesions to the Chinese . But , I am one voice . The Dalai Lama has always trusted in the forces of Buddha . Let us consult the protective deities . Taktra Rinpoche bows and leaves him .
TAKTRA RINPOCHE: We should not accept any conditions from the Chinese .
TENZIN GYATSO: Enter . It is the Regent .
REGENT TAKTRA: Holiness .
TENZIN GYATSO: Yes .
REGENT TAKTRA: The Chinese have invaded .
LORD CHAMBERLAIN: They crossed the river , Holiness . They have invaded in six locations , Chando Province , Kham , eastern Tibet .
TENZIN GYATSO: What is the size of our army , now ?
LORD CHAMBERLAIN: Eight thousand , five hundred , soldiers and officers . We have recently requested mortars , anti-aircraft guns and ammunition from India . We have several hundred in the area .
TENZIN GYATSO: Has anyone died ?
LORD CHMBERLAIN: The radio contact said one officer had died . Then he said , `` The Chinese soldiers - they are coming . '' And then , the radio went dead .
TENZIN GYATSO: One man . A man has died . One man is too many .
RADIO: `` This week , the People 's Liberation Army crossed the Drichu River east of Chamdo and began the peaceful liberation of Tibet . Tibet is in the hands of imperialist enemies of the people . The Dalai Lama , a foolish reminde of an illiterate past , is the figure head of this autonomous region of China . Accept ou help , Tibet ! The people shall be free ! ''
TENZIN GYATSO: What do the people say , Norbu ? Norbu is not shy in his report .
NORBU THUNDRUP: Tibetan officials have retreated from Chamdo . They are scared and unning . The Chinese strategy has destroyed the heart of our defense forces . Chamdo falls , several othe villages are lost . You know what happens . The road to Lhasa will be wide open . Tenzin Gyatso listens carefully to the man .
TENZIN GYATSO: Then , I am lucky . I am still too young .
NORBU THUNDRUP: These are dangerous times . They want the Dalai Lama to lead them .
TENZIN GYATSO: But , I have no experience .
NORBU THUNDRUP: Oh , but you do , Kundun . Who else would be here ?
ORACLE: `` His time has come . ''
TENZIN GYATSO: `` To the members of the United Nations The attention of the world is iveted on Korea where aggression is being resisted by an international force . Similar happenings in remote Tibet are passing without notice . The problem is not of Tibet 's own making but is largely the outcome of unthwarted Chinese ambition to bring weaker nations on he periphery within her active domination . '' This is very good . Quite strong .
TAKSTER RINPOCHE: I was never alone . Two Chinese were with me every minute of the day .
TENZIN GYATSO: Tell me .
TAKSTER RINPOCHE: They think they have convinced me . They think I am on their side . They have allowed me to leave Kumbum and come to Lhasa believing that I will try to turn you to their ways . If I do not succeed , I am to eliminate you .
TENZIN GYATSO: You , kill me ?
TAKSTER RINPOCHE: Eliminate you . The tension is great , the idea profound .
TARSTER RINPOCHE: I can be Governor of Lhasa , they say .
TAKSTER RINPOCHE: Do n't eat all those sweets . You 'll get sick .
TENZIN GYATSO: Do you remember the day I came to your monastery , when I was a baby ? And you comforted me ?
TAKSTER RINPOCHE: I do .
TENZIN GYATSO: I remember , too , actually . I was frightened then . I am frightened now .
TAKSTER RINPOCHE: The Chinese have one goal . The complete dissolution of our nation . The destruction of our culture . There is no room for Buddha in their world . Our only hope is to fight .
TENZIN GYATSO: We can not .
TAKSTER RINPOCHE: This is not a fight to put ead just in one 's own mouth . This is a fight for Tibet .
TENZIN GYATSO: Buddha teaches that we must learn from our enemy . We have compassion for all people .
TAKSTER RINPOCHE: These are not human beings . They are worse than ghosts . Silence .
TENZIN GYATSO: How could I ever leave ?
TAKSTER RINPOCHE: It may not be your decision to make .
TENZIN GYATSO: I accept it .
NORBU THUNDRUP: No , Holiness .
TENZIN GYATSO: Am I running away ?
NORBU THUNDRUP: The people will cry when they learn you are gone . But they would all want you safe .
TENZIN GYATSO: I will miss you .
NORBU THUNDRUP: We have had fun , you and I . Fun for a little boy in an old palace .
TENZIN GYATSO: We have .
NORBU THUNDRUP: You have grown up very good .
TENZIN GYATSO: And you have grown older and your chin has grown balder . Norbu laughs . The telescope is wrapped .
NORBU THUNDRUP: Tonight , Kundun , you see the world . You place your feet on the shepherd boy 's path . Norbu Thundrup ties a tight knot in a cord .
BODYGUARD: We must go , Holiness .
TENZIN GYATSO: A moment . Another drawer . Empty . And then , success .
BODYGUARD: Please , come , Holiness .
TENZIN GYATSO: Yes . I am ready .
MONKS: Do not let him go ! We beg of you , do not take him from us !
LING RINPOCHE: He goes for a short time , until the danger can be determined . He will not leave Tibet . He will eturn .
TENZIN GYATSO: All quiet ?
BODYGUARD: Yes , Holiness .
TENZIN GYATSO: Where are you from ?
BODYGUARD: Kham , Holiness .
TENZIN GYATSO: Your people are very brave . They are fighting the Chinese . No one can stop them . Not even me .
BODYGUARD: Khambas are wild men .
TENZIN GYATSO: I worry about them .
BODYGUARD: Do not worry , Holiness . They fight for you . They are under your protection . The boy steps back inside .
MUSLIM MAN: Eighteen children .
TENZIN GYATSO: Eighteen , wonderful .
MUSLIM MAN: And not a monk among them . The Dalai Lama laughs .
TENZIN GYATSO: Did you love your husband , before you married ?
TIBETAN WOMAN: I did not know him before I married him . I loved his other , but then , I married his other , too . He is dead now .
TENZIN GYATSO: Hmm .
TIBETAN WOMAN: The land has stayed in the family . We work together . The nobleman is not too bad .
TENZIN GYATSO: Does he treat you fairly ? A laugh from her .
TIBETAN WOMAN: Not too bad . Rich is rich , poor is poor . We are different . Are you married ? Tenzin Gyatso laughs .
TENZIN GYATSO: No .
TIBETAN WOMAN: Too young ?
TENZIN GYATSO: Much too young .
TIBETAN WOMAN: Look for a strong woman , not too occupied with her beauty . Look for a woinan who keeps her hands busy . Look fo a kind heart .
TENZIN GYATSO: Like my mother .
TIBETAN WOMAN: I see that .
TENZIN GYATSO: This little brother was terribly sweet . When he died , my mother was so sad . A lama said to her , before the little brothe was laid out for burial , take a bit of butter and rub a spot on his skin . He will come back to you , you will see . So , my mother did this , and a few years later , a new boy was born .
NOBLE BOY: Does he have the spot ?
TENZIN GYATSO: He does , a little spot where the utter had been .
NOBLE BOY: Is that a true story , or pretend ?
TENZIN GYATSO: What do you think ?
NOBLE BOY: True .
TENZIN GYATSO: You decide . They walk .
NOBLE BOY: What does the butter spot feel like ?
TENZIN GYATSO: Soft . Nice . I have a good friend back in Lhasa . He has a very poor beard , with a little spot on his chin where no hair grows . It feels like that .
KASHAG MEMBER: Of the Tibetan delegations sent abroad , all have been turned away .
TENZIN GYATSO: And the United Nations ? Surely ?
KASHAG MEMBER: The United Nations voted not to hear our appeal .
LORD CHAMBERLAIN: One country did sponsor the esolution . A land called `` El Salvador '' .
TENZIN GYATSO: Where is that ?
LORD CHAMBERLAIN: In the Americas . Silence .
TENZIN GYATSO: So , we must face China and all her might alone .
KASHAG MEMBER: Yes . Most of the Chamdo region is now in Chinese hands . There is a report from Chamdo which makes quite clear that , unless some settlement can soon be reached , Communist troops will soon be marching on Lhasa .
TENZIN GYATSO: With much bloodshed .
KASHAG MEMBER: I am afraid .
TENZIN GYATSO: I want at all costs to avoid this . Do we have news from the delegation in China ?
KASHAG MEMBERR: Not yet , but the Governor of Chamdo , Ngabo Jigme , suggests we must negotiate and offers to go to Peking .
TENZIN GYATSO: He is a capable man .
LORD CHAMBERLAIN: Your prime minsters would argue that such negotiations should take place in Lhasa .
TENZIN GYATSO: And then they would concede that the times are desperate and we must go to Peking . Agreed . Send Ngabo . Is that all ?
KASHAG MEMBER: Yes .
TENZIN GYATSO: Time to study . The boy gets up . The prostrations begin .
LORD CHAMBERLAIN: He is a modern man . Just like he was the last time .
TENZIN GYATSO: `` I will liberate those not liberated . '' I will release those not eleased . I will relieve those not elieved . May I deliver them to the state of enlightenment . ''
KASHAG MEMBER: Ngabo did not have the state seal . He could not sign .
TENZIN GYATSO: Yes , but they say he did .
KASHAG MEMBER: Holiness ?
TENZIN GYATSO: Yes .
KASHAG MEMBER: General Chiang Chin-wu , the Chinese representative , is en route to Dromo . He is coming to meet you .
TENZIN GYATSO: Then , we shall meet .
KASHAG MEMBER: Your Prime Ministers , support the proposal that you return to Lhasa . On the opposite hand , some officials urge you not to return . They elieve you should leave now , for India .
TENZIN GYATSO: If I were to go into exile , could we expect any serious assistance , from India , suppose ?
LORD CHANBERLAIN: It is unlikely . America , perhaps . There is great anti-communist feeling in America .
TENZIN GYATSO: At this point , the most likely esult of a foreign pact is war .
LORD CHAABERLAIN: The Chinese would see such a pact as an open declaration of war .
TENZIN GYATSO: Tibet , at war ? No . China is close , America is fa away . After countless people die , China would still , always , e close . We will work with what we have .
KASHAG MEMBER: And as for your own safety , Holiness ? A pause .
TENZIN GYATSO: I am scared .
LORD CHAMBERLAIN: Shall we consult the protective deities , Holiness ?
TENZIN GYATSO: My first and foremost duty is to protect my people . I feel sure of this . And , things change . Maybe not right away , maybe not soon . But I believe this - things will change . The boy snaps his fingers .
TAKTRA RINPOCHE: I hope you will not feel badly about all the things of childhood you missed .
TENZIN GYATSO: No !
FATHER: Goodbye , Kundun . TENZIN GYATSO No !
TENZIN GYATSO: No , Norbu ! Reverse on Norbu , fading away .
GENERAL CHIANG: I am not a foreigner ! I refuse to be treated like one .
TENZIN GYATSO: You see here thangkas of the Fifth Dalai Lama , the founde of our government . It is tradition at formal meetings for these thangkas to be hung .
GENERAL CHIANG: Superstitions . Tibet is part of a modern nation . The General sits .
TENZIN GYATSO: Songs ? What songs ? A slight smile .
GENERAL CHIANG: You must also do something about the public meetings . I see this , memorandum circulating , with Tibetan grievances .
LUKHANGWA: You have cracked a man 's skull and that crack has not healed . It is too soon to expect him to be your friend .
GENERAL CHIANG: We are simply respecting the terms of the Seventeen Point Agreement .
LUKHANGWA: Are you , General ?
GENERAL CHIANG: We want 2,000 more tons of barley distributed .
LUKHANGWA: Impossible ! You will bring famine down on the people of Tibet with these insatiable demands ! More food , the best land fo your soldiers to camp .
GENERAL CHIANG: The People 's Liberation Army pays for all food and lodging .
LUKHANGWA: So far , they do . But , the quantity , it does not exist . You will have to re- evaluate your needs . The men glare at one another .
GENERAL CHIANG: How much tea do you drink , Prime Minister ?
LUKHANGWA: It depends on the quality . And , that it be Indian .
GENERAL CHIANG: To protect . To serve you . Chairman Mao wants you to feel that China belongs to you now .
LUKHANGWA: Chairman Mao can keep China . Just give us back Tibet .
GENERAL CHIANG: Plans for absorbing the Tibetan army into the People 's Army will soon be finalized .
LUKHANGWA: I will not approve it .
GENERAL CHIANG: Then , we will begin with replacing the Tibetan flag with the flag of the Motherland .
LUKHANGWA: And we will begin with tearing it down .
TENZIN GYATSO: I am so sorry .
LUKHANGWA: It must be done . We can no longer meet with the Chinese , they refuse us .
TENZIN GYATSO: I accept your resignations .
LOBSANG TASHI: Have you chosen your new Prime Ministers , Holiness ?
TENZIN GYATSO: There will be no new Prime Ministers .
LUKHANGWA: You will face great difficulties , Holiness .
TENZIN GYATSO: They have taken away our silence .
DALAI LAMA: Always . Tenzin Gyatso records Mao 's words .
TENZIN GYATSO: He will betray us .
LORD CHAMBEPIAIN: Did you ever doubt it ?
TENZIN GYATSO: I had relinquished doubt .
OLD WOMAN: I am very happy and prosperous under the guidance of the Chinese Communist Party and chairman Mao Tse Tung . It is a horrifying announcement .
TENZIN GYATSO: I ask them to stop , to lay down their guns .
LORD CHAMBERLAIN: The Khamba 's gun is his most prized possession . I admire them so . They face a modern , well equipped army , and still , they fight . The Dalai Lama rubs his face with his hands .
TENZIN GYATSO: A beggar can be called a landlord if he disapproves of the Chinese .
LORD CHAMBERLAIN: The Communists put their guns in the hands of the Khamba children and force the child to kill the parent . They have dropped bombs on the monastery of Lithang in Kham . It has been destroyed . Women and children , trying to escape from the fighting , have been shot with machine guns , fired from airplanes . Again , silence .
TENZIN GYATSO: The pursuit of non-violence . Very difficult .
LORD CHAMBERLAIN: Non-violence means co-operation when it is possible . Resistance , when it is not .
GENERAL CHIANG: We have decided that no drastic changes will take place in Tibet for six years . This should make you happy . Silence .
TENZIN GYATSO: I will not approve it .
GENERAL CHIANG: We must deal with these eactionaries !
TENZIN GYATSO: No . We are peace loving people . I am afraid we can not trust you . The General sputters
GENERAL CHIANG: We are here to heal the people of Tibet . You need reform . You have no sense of what is good for your people . We are here to liberate you ! Now , the boy finds his voice .
TENZIN GYATSO: I burn here , but I am not suppose to let the smoke show . Yes , we need eform . The monasteries . Communications . Schools . But we want change for Tibet , as Tibet needs it , not for China .
LORD CHAMBERLAIN: They will take Lhasa next .
TENZIN GYATSO: The people will not allow it .
NECHUNG ORACLE: Where there is no crossing a big river , no fords , no shallows , where the only hope is a oat , and there is no boat I will put a boat , Kundun . The wish-Fulfilling Jewel will shine from the West . It is a strange and confusing prophecy .
LORD CHAMBERLAIN: The crowd will not disperse until you give your assurance that you will not attend the Chinese festivities . Many who have been invited to dine with the Chinese do not return home .
TENZIN GYATSO: I will not go .
LORD CHAMBERLAIN: I will alert the Chinese delegation . You know , I would never have let you go alone , Kundun .
TENZIN GYATSO: Do you think I must ?
MOTHER: You decide . He says , softly
TENZIN GYATSO: Tibet has never been part of China . We are different races . We are different cultures . We need change , we know that . But we could do it alone . We were just about to do it alone . The young man fills the last bowl with water .
LORD CHAMBERLAIN: We are now accused of aiding the ebels . The Chinese said we can expect drastic measures to be taken to crush this revolt .
TENZIN GYATSO: Arrange for me to speak to the people 's leaders . The Lord Chamberlain hurries away .
FIRST LEADER: Holiness , the Chinese tried to entice you to their garrison with out protection of bodyguard . Even now , they urge you to come to them for safety . They are inging more troops and guns and artillery into Lhasa . There are three airplanes waiting outside Lhasa . What do they wait for ? They are planning to kill the Dalai Lama . Do n't you see ?
NECHUNG ORACLE: Stay .
LORD CHAMBERLAIN: The Chinese are planning to attack the crowd and shell the Norbulinka . You are asked to indicate on a map where you will be so that the artillery men will not mistakenly aim at you . The Dalai Lama walks down the outdoor stairs .
TENZIN GYATSO: Tell them I will be here . With my people . Right here .
ORACLE: Go ! Go ! Tonight !
TENZIN GYATSO: Dim the lights . and then he bow bends down , to pat a dog .
SOLDIER: Move aside , tour of inspection , move aside .
KHAMBA BODYGUARD: Move aside , let us through . Move aside !
TENZIN GYATSO: I have always loved mountains . He is handed a steaming cup of tea . And then , a cloud passes over the moon .
LORD CHAMBERLAIN: `` The Gods will be avenged ! ''
TENZIN GYATSO: I repudiate the Seventeen Point Agreement
SOLDIER: With all respect , may I ask ? Who are you ?
TENZIN GYATSO: What you see before you is a man . A simple monk .
SOLDIER: Are you the Lord Buddha ? Pause .
TENZIN GYATSO: I think I am a reflection , like the moon , on water . When you see me , and I try to be a good man , see yourself

PO: No .
MANTIS: Yes .
VIPER: But that was before
PO: Before what ?
TIGRESS: Before Tai Lung .

OOGWAY: There are no accidents .
SHIFU: Yes , I know . You 've said that already . Twice .
OOGWAY: Well , that was no accident either .
SHIFU: Thrice .
OOGWAY: My old friend , the panda will neve fulfill his destiny , nor you yours , until you let go of the illusion of control .
SHIFU: Illusion ?
OOGWAY: Yeah . Look at this tree , Shifu . I can not make it blossom when it suits me , nor make it bear fruit efore its time .
SHIFU: But there are things we can control .
OOGWAY: Ah , yes . But no matter what you do , that seed will grow to be a peach tree . You may wish for an apple , o an orange but you will get a peach .
SHIFU: But a peach can not defeat Tai Lung !
OOGWAY: Maybe it can . If you are willing to guide it , to nurture it . To believe in it .
SHIFU: But how ? How ? I need your help , Master .
OOGWAY: No , you just need to believe . Promise me , Shifu . Promise me you will believe .
SHIFU: I I will try .
OOGWAY: Good . My time has come . You must continue your journey without me .
SHIFU: What what are you.. ?

MANTIS: Oh , nothing Master Shifu !
PO: You will never be the Dragon Warrior , unless you lose five hundred pounds and brush you teeth !
MONKEY: It 's Shifu .
PO: Of course it 's Shifu . What do you think I 'm doing ?
SHIFU: You think this is funny ? Tai Lung has escaped from prison and you 're acting like children !
PO: What ?

TIGRESS: Master , please . Let us stop Tai Lung . This is what you 've trained us for .
SHIFU: No ! It is not your destiny to defeat Tai Lung . It is his .
PO: Watch me !
SHIFU: You will beat him because you are the Dragon Warrior !
PO: Ow ! You do n't believe that ! You never believed that ! From the first moment I got here , you 've been trying to get rid of me .
SHIFU: Yes . I was . But now I ask you to trust in your master as I have come to trust in mine .
PO: You 're not my master . And I 'm not the Dragon Warrior .
SHIFU: Then why did n't you quit ? You knew I was trying to get rid of you , and yet you stayed .
PO: Yeah , I stayed . I stayed because every time you threw a brick at my head or said I smelled , it hurt . But it could never hurt more than it did every day of my life just eing me .
SHIFU: But I can change you ! I can turn you into the Dragon Warrior ! And I will !
PO: C'mon , Tai Lung is on his way here ight now . And even if it takes him a hundred years to get here , how are you gon na change this into the Dragon Warrior ? How ? How ? How ? !
