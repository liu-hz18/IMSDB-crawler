EXLEY: What 's on the call sheet ?
YOUNG OFFICER: A guy dressed as Santa has been exposing himself to kids in Los Feliz . Apparently , sir , he 's decorated himself .
EXLEY: Decorated ?
YOUNG OFFICER: With tinsel and plastic icicles and on his penis , sir .
EXLEY: I get the idea . You got a description ?
YOUNG OFFICER: Of his penis , sir ?
LYNN: A case each of gin , Scotch , and um . Everything top shelf . None of that watered-down stuff you push on Errol Flynn .

LYNN: We just call him Buzz .
BUD: You okay ?
PATCHETT: She 's fine .
BUD: I 'm not asking you .
LYNN: It 's not what you think .
BUD: What is it then ?
SUSAN: You got the wrong idea , Mister . I 'm fine .
LYNN: But it 's nice to know you care .
STENSLAND: What 's going on ?
BUD: You know him ?
STENSLAND: Seen him around . He used to be a cop .
REPORTER: Captain Smith , I
DUDLEY: Drop the formalities ; it 's Christmas Eve . Call me Dudley .
REPORTER: Dudley , I came up with a title fo the story . I 'm calling it `` Silent Night with the L.A.P.D . ''
DUDLEY: Excellent . How 's this ? The sanctity of the night is an invitation to the darker criminal element . Our vigilance will not e diminished . As the Reporter scribbles down the quote
YOUNG OFFICER: Two police officers were assaulted in a bar . Brown and Helenowski .
DUDLEY: This is Sergeant Ed Exley . Son of the legendary Preston Exley . He 's the watch commander tonight and a damn fine job . As the photographer snaps Exley 's picture
EXLEY: To the solving of crimes that equire absolute justice .
DUDLEY: That was his favorite toast . I saw the test results on the lieutenant 's exam . You placed first out of twenty-three .
EXLEY: The youngest applicant by eight years .
DUDLEY: You 'll make lieutenant inside a year . Patrol division ?
EXLEY: I was thinking Detective Bureau . We can see Dudley does n't approve .
DUDLEY: You do n't have the eye for human weakness to be a good detective . Or the stomach . You 're a political animal , Edmund .
EXLEY: You 're wrong .
DUDLEY: Am I ? Would you be willing to plant corroborative evidence on a suspect you knew was guilty in order to ensure an indictment ?
EXLEY: Dudley , we 've been over this .
DUDLEY: Answer yes or no .
EXLEY: I No .
DUDLEY: Would you be willing to rig crime scene evidence to support a prosecuting attorney 's working hypothesis ? Yes or no , Edmund .
EXLEY: No .
DUDLEY: Would you be willing to beat confessions out of suspects you knew to be guilty ?
EXLEY: No .
DUDLEY: Would you be willing to shoot hardened criminals in the back to offset the chance
EXLEY: No .
DUDLEY: Then for God 's sake , do n't be a detective . Stick to assignments where you wo n't have to make those choices . Patrol , Internal Affairs , but not the Bureau .
EXLEY: I know you mean well , Dudley , but I do n't need to do it the way you did . Or my father .
DUDLEY: At least get rid of the glasses . I ca n't think of one Bureau man who wears them .
STENSLAND: Hey , partner . Grab a cup .
BUD: I got to write my report first .
JACK: Hi I 'd like to get a delivery to Beverly Hills .
EXLEY: All right , men . You 've had you fun . Time to break it up .
STENSLAND: Fucking Exley . Guy 's got a pole so far up his ass , every time he farts the flag waves .
EXLEY: What 's going on ?
COP: They got the spics who japped Helenowski and Brown . Helenowski lost an eye and Brown 's got brain damage .
EXLEY: I have the report right here . They 're home with bruises and muscle pulls Oh shit Exley starts out after them .
STENSLAND: For ours , Pancho . And you 're getting off easy .
JACK: White , you better get a lease on Stens before he kills someone .
GARCIA: Fuck you , pendejo .
BUD: Yeah yeah
GARCIA: And fuck your mother too .
EXLEY: Stop , Officer ! That 's an order !
CHIEF: Officer White , you 've refused to cooperate with Internal Affairs . But you should know this is bigge than a police board . Indictments may be handed down . Quite frankly , we need police witnesses to offset the damage done to the Department 's image . Will you testify ?
BUD: No , sir . I wo n't . The Chief sighs , looks to Loew .
CHIEF: District Attorney Loew .
LOEW: Bloody Christmas . The press love to label . You and Office Stensland brought the liquor into the precinct . Stensland was already drunk . Do you see how appearing as a voluntary witness against him could offset the damage you 've done to yourself ?
BUD: I wo n't do it . I wo n't testify against my partne or anyone else .
LOEW: This man is a disgrace .
CHIEF: Your badge and gun , Officer . Bud sets them on The Chief 's desk .
EXLEY: The public demands justice , sir . This was a full-fledged riot of policemen . Shift the guilt to men whose pensions are secured . Force them to retire . But someone has to swing . Indict , try and convict Stensland and Bud White . Secure them jail time . Feed them to the sharks , sir . Protect yourself ; protect the department .
DUDLEY: Stensland 's a disgrace . Straight D fitness reports from every C.O . he ever served under . But White is a valuable officer .
EXLEY: White 's a mindless thug .
DUDLEY: No , Edmund . He 's a man who can answer yes to those questions I ask you from time to time . The Chief interrupts with his own concern .
CHIEF: I want to know who we give the public in contrast ? The department needs role models . Clean-cut , forthright men the public can admire .
EXLEY: I 'll testify , sir . I 'm not afraid to do what 's right .
CHIEF: And I 'll promote you . You 'll be a lieutenant immediately .
EXLEY: Detective lieutenant .
CHIEF: Ed , you 're 30 . Your father did n't make lieutenant until he was 33 .
EXLEY: I know that , sir . I also know that when he made lieutenant , it was as a detective .
LOEW: Before we start polishing ou laurels , it would look better if we had a corroborative witness .
DUDLEY: That 'll be hard to come by . The men hate a turncoat .
EXLEY: Jack Vincennes . He 's the technical advisor on 'Badge of Honor , ' sir . He lives for it . That 's the way to get him .
CHIEF: All right , Ed . Call Sergeant Vincennes .
DUDLEY: You 'll reap the benefits , but are you truly prepared to be despised within the department ?
EXLEY: Yes , Dudley . I am .
DUDLEY: So be it .
DUDLEY: Sergeant , we 'll get right to it . Nine civilian witnesses have identified you as hitting Ezekiel Garcia .
LOEW: But my office has a stella witness who will tell the grand jury that you hit back only afte eing hit .
JACK: What do I have to do ?
LOEW: Testify against the three officers who have already earned thei pensions . Our key witness will testify roundly , but you can plead ignorance to questions directed at the other men .
CHIEF: I 'll guarantee you a slap on the wrist . A brief suspension followed by a temporary transfe from Narcotics to Ad Vice . When you transfer out of Vice , you 'll be back on the show .
JACK: The show , sir ?
CHIEF: Badge of Honor , Vincennes . We need to tone down your profile fo a bit . The Chief just got Jack where he lives .
DUDLEY: John , I doubt you 've ever drawn a stupid breath . Do n't start now .
JACK: Okay . I 'll do it .
CHIEF: Dismissed , Vincennes .
JACK: You 're the key witness ?
EXLEY: That 's right .
JACK: I should 've known . What 's the Chief throwing you ?
EXLEY: Throwing me ?
JACK: Yeah , Exley . What 's the payoff ?
EXLEY: You 're the payoff expert . I 'm just doing my duty .
JACK: You 're playing an angle , college oy . You 're getting something out of this so you do n't have to hobnob with the fucking rank and file cops who 'll hate your guts for snitching . If they 're making you a detective , watch out . Some Bureau guys are gon na burn in this and you 're gon na have to work with friends of theirs .
EXLEY: What about you ?
JACK: I 'm snitching three old timers who 'll be fishing in Oregon next week . Next to you I 'm clean . And smart . At that , a CLERK steps in from the hallway .
CLERK: Edmund J. Exley to chambers . As Exley 's about to go
JACK: Just remember , Bud White 'll fuck you for this if it takes the rest of his life . They already suspended him . Just pray he cops a deal and stays on the Department ecause that is one civilian you do not want on your case .
BUD: That an old fashioned you 're drinking ? My name 's Bud .
REDHEAD: Nobody was born with the name Bud .
BUD: They stick you with a name like Wendell , you look for an alias .
REDHEAD: What do you do , Bud ?
BUD: I 'm sorta between jobs . Look , what do you say we , uh
DUDLEY: Lad , may I have a word with you ?
BUD: This business , Captain ?
DUDLEY: Say goodnight to your friend and join me by those back tables .
BUD: Does that paper say we 've been indicted ? Does it say Exley 's a hero for squealing me and Stensland off ?
DUDLEY: He made his play amd he got what he wanted . They 're making him a detective .
BUD: Captain , what do you want ?
DUDLEY: Call me Dudley .
BUD: Dudley , what do you want ?
DUDLEY: Lad , I admire your refusal to testify and your loyalty to you partner . I admire you as a policeman , particularly you adherence to violence as a necessary adjutant to the job . And I am most impressed with you punishment of wife beaters . Do you hate them , Wendell ?
BUD: Yeah , I hate them .
DUDLEY: And for good reason judging from what I know of your background .
BUD: What 's going to happen to Stensland ? He 'll give himself cirrhosis over this . He 's oneyear from his pension .
DUDLEY: It would 've happened years ago if you had n't carried him . Why the loyalty , Wendell ?
BUD: He helped me out once . That 's all .
DUDLEY: Your partner 's through . Department scapegoat on the Chief 's orders . He 's been billed , he 'll be indicted and he 'll swing .
BUD: Him and me both . Fucking Exley .
DUDLEY: Do n't underestimate his skills . As a politician he exceeds even myself . But the department needs smart men like Exley and direct men like yourself
BUD: What do you want ?
DUDLEY: Wendell , I want you to come to work for me .
BUD: Doing what ? Mowing your fucking lawn ?
DUDLEY: They 're yours . Take them .
BUD: I knew you had juice , but There 's no goddamn bill on me ?
DUDLEY: Four of the defendants recanted their testimony .
BUD: How ?
DUDLEY: I need you for an assignment the Chief 's given me the go-ahead on . A duty few men are fit for , but you were born for . You 'll be working out of Homicide .
BUD: Homicide ? A detective ?
CHIEF: Your talents lie elsewhere , Wendell . It 's a muscle job and shooting job . You 'll do what I say and not ask questions . Do you follow my drift ?
BUD: In Technicolor .
DUDLEY: Will you work for me ?
BUD: Of course But how ?
DUDLEY: How what , Wendell ?
BUD: How 'd you get them to retract ?
CHASE: I 'm not a policeman . I just play one on television . But I think I can answer for them . To help people . That 's why I do the show .
JACK: I wo n't be there . They 're toning down my profile .
BUD: Domestic . Assault and battery .
CARLISLE: Ready to go , Bud ?
BUD: I 'll be there in five minutes .
PRISONER: My wife . She 's dropping charges so it 's none of your business .
COHEN: What do you mean Deuce Perkins got clipped last night ? !
STOMPANATO: They shot him in his library .
COHEN: I do n't want a floor plan ; I want to know who ! Who 's taking the ticket for this , Johnny ?
STOMPANATO: Nobody . At least not yet .
COHEN: And what about the merchandise Deuce was holding for me ?
STOMPANATO: Gone . Not a trace .
COHEN: Some ferstunkener is moving in and we do n't know who ? ! Maybe we should ask Hedda Hopper !
VICE CAPTAIN: Picture-book smut , gentlemen . There 's been a bunch of it found at collateral crime scenes lately . Mostly narcotics and prostitution collars .
JACK: Gee . The Great Jerk-Off Book Caper of 1953 .
VICE CAPTAIN: Vincennes , is there someplace you 'd rather be ?
JACK: Yeah , Cap . Back in Narcotics .
VICE CAPTAIN: Oh ? Anyplace else ?
JACK: Working whores with squad two .
VICE CAPTAIN: Maybe you should have thought of that before you made Bloody Christmas page one .
HUDGEONS: Hush-Hush . Off the record and on the Q.T .
JACK: No . But I 've got something going with Ad Vice .
HUDGEONS: Something good ?
JACK: Do n't know . I 'm chasing picture ooks . Fuck shots , but the posers do n't look like junkies . It 's well done stuff . I thought you might have heard something .
HUDGEONS: Not a word .
JACK: What about Fleur-de-Lis ? Thei slogan 's 'Whatever you desire . '
HUDGEONS: No . No , I 've heard bupkis . Jack , I 'll talk to you later . Call me when you get something I can use . Smut 's from hunger . For sad sacks who ca n't get their ashes hauled
EXLEY: You 're just a thug , White . That 's all you 'll ever be .
DUDLEY: You should stay away from a man when his blood is up .
EXLEY: His blood 's always up .
DUDLEY: Then maybe you should stay away from him all the time .
STENSLAND: Do n't look so down in the mouth , Bud . You nailed him good .
BUD: Yeah , sure I got a couple of hours before I have to be at the Victory . Want to grab a beer ?
STENSLAND: Rain check me , partner . I got something big going on tonight .
BUD: What ? That new mystery girl you 've been seeing ?
STENSLAND: No . I 'll tell you sometime . Not now . Do n't want to jinx it . But it could take the edge off that jail time I got coming .
BUD: What are you talking about ?
STENSLAND: It 's confidential , Bud . Like that magazines Vincennes scams for . u > Hush-Hush . I 'll see you tomorrow . And hey , if it works out , you 'll get a piece of it .
VOICE: Squad call ! Nite Owl Coffee Shop One-eight-one-two-four Cherokee ! Multiple homicides ! Multiple homicides ! Code three !
PATROLMAN #1: Loads of people down . Men . Women . I stopped for coffee
ROOKIE: S-s-sir , there 's a captain outside wants to see you .
EXLEY: Do n't get sick ! Not in here !
DUDLEY: Edmund , you do n't want it and you ca n't have it .
EXLEY: Yes , I do , sir .
DUDLEY: It 's mine . I 'll make you my second in command .
PINKER: We got a total of forty-five spent 12-gauge Remington shotgun shells . Three men with five-shot-capacity pumps . All of them reloading twice .
EXLEY: Hold on We need to canvass . See if a purple Mercury was seen around here tonight .
DUDLEY: Why ?
EXLEY: We got a call earlier on three Negro youths . Firing shotguns in Griffith Park from a late-model purple Mercury Coupe .
DUDLEY: Get on it . A FORENSICS COP approaches Pinker .
FORENSICS COP: We got an I.D . on one of the victims , sir I think it 's Dick Stensland . Exley and Dudley react , look at each other .
DUDLEY: With Mickey Cohen in prison , Los Angeles is organized crime free . The Chief wants it to stay that way , Edmund . The means are not for the weak-hearted .
FLATNOSE: I know things . I hear things . Like with the Mick inside , things are on this weird slowdown .
DUDLEY: We know all that , lad . Tell us , who do these shooters work for ?
FLATNOSE: I do n't know . No one knows . Maybe they 're mavericks . You want a prostie roust ? Huh ? Some narco action ? What do you want ? !
DUDLEY: We want you to go home . Uncuff him , Michael . Dudley turns to Exley .
FLATNOSE: Motherfuckers !
DUDLEY: It 's part of the play , Edmund . A sincerity test .
BUD: Where are we going ?
EXLEY: It 's a surprise . You like surprises , do n't you , White ?
CORONER: Call me crazy , but for a second I thought it was Rita Hayworth .
EXLEY: We need you to I.D . the body . There 's no next of kin and you knew him best . So tell me
BUD: Yeah , that 's Stens .
EXLEY: Hell of a way to avoid a prison sentence .
BUD: What happened ?
EXLEY: Someone held up a coffee shop , panicked and killed six people . Then , from the hall
CORONER: Is this your daughter , Mrs. Lefferts ?
MRS. LEFFERTS: I I do n't know .
EXLEY: We know this is difficult . Just take your time and look again .
MRS. LEFFERTS: It seems like my Susan , but
EXLEY: When was the last time you saw her , Mrs. Lefferts ?
MRS. LEFFERTS: At Christmas . We had fought . I did n't like her boyfriend . I she has a birthmark on her hip .
DUDLEY: 'Nite Owl Massacre . ' Hyperbole aside , this is a heinous crime that requires a swift resolution . The public will demand it and this department will provide it . Six victims . One of them , one of ou own Dick Stensland . As it happens , he was a Nite Owl egular . In the wrong place at the wrong time .
CHIEF: Enough on that . Gentlemen , just go out and get them . Use all necessary force . The people of Los Angeles demand it .
EXLEY: He might as well have put a bounty on them .
BUD: Can you take them ? I got I got something I got ta do .
PARTNER: Christ , I do n't know . What if one of these names
BUD: What I got ta do is for Stensland . My partner .
REDNECK: Where to , Trash ?
JACK: If we go by the list , we have about zero chance of making the collar . But I know a guy who knows what 's going on south of Jefferson . I 'm betting he could put us at 50/50 .
REDNECK: I do n't know
EXLEY: I 'll take those odds . Take off . We got it from here .
REDNECK: Between the two of you guys , you should bring along a photographer .
BUD: I need an address on a customer of yours . Her name was Lynn .
OWNER: That 's all I have to go on ?
BUD: Yeah . And I think you already know who I mean , so cough it up .
OWNER: Lynn Bracken . There 's a billing address and a delivery address .
BUD: Give me both . Billing first .
PATCHETT: I am . Are you soliciting fo police charities ? The last time , you people called at my office .
BUD: I 'm a homicide detective . Where were you last night ?
PATCHETT: I was here , hosting a party . Who was killed and why do you think I can help ?
BUD: Richard Stensland .
PATCHETT: I do n't know him . Mr
BUD: Officer White . How about Susan Lefferts ? You know her ?
PATCHETT: You know I do or you would n't be here . How did you find me ?
BUD: We met outside Hollywood Liquors on Christmas Eve . This is where Lynn Bracken 's booze bills go .
PATCHETT: Of course
BUD: Sue Lefferts died at the Nite Owl . I 'm investigating .
BODYGUARD: Everything alright , Mr. Patchett ?
PATCHETT: Fine , Philip . Thank you .
BUD: Where 's the other guy ? Buzz .
PATCHETT: He no longer works for me . Find Susan 's killer , Mr. White . I 'll give you a handsome reward . u > Whatever you desire . If only Jack had been around to hear that .
BUD: Thanks , but no thanks .
PATCHETT: Against your code ?
BUD: I do n't have one . Lefferts looked eat-up Christmas Eve , but did n't act it . How come ?
PATCHETT: Do you care about criminal matters peripheral to Susan 's murder ?
BUD: No .
PATCHETT: Then you would n't feel obligated to report them ?
BUD: That 's right .
PATCHETT: Then listen closely , because I 'll only say this once and if it gets epeated , I 'll deny it . I run call girls . Lynn Bracken is one of them and so was Susan Lefferts . I treat my girls very well . I have grown daughters , myself , and I do n't like the thought of women eing hurt . I sense you share this feeling .
BUD: Why were Lefferts ' eyes black ?
PATCHETT: I think she 'd been hit in the face with a tennis racket . She is was a big doubles fan .
BUD: You wan na go downtown and discuss this officially ?
PATCHETT: Wait . Our deal still holds ? Bud nods , his patience running thin .
BUD: What little studio ?
PATCHETT: There 's Gardner , Hepburn , Grable , Turner . Lynn Bracken is my Veronica Lake . I use girls who look like movie stars . Sometimes I employ a plastic surgeon .
BUD: That 's why her mother could n't I.D . her Jesus fucking Christ .
PATCHETT: No , Mr. White . Pierce Morehouse Patchett . Now , I sense you 're on your best behavior , but that 's all I 'll give you . If you persist , I 'll meet you with my attorney . Now , would you like Miss Bracken 's address ? I doubt she knows anything , but
BUD: I got her address .
PATCHETT: Of course this is personal with you , is n't it , Mr. White ?
LYNN: Hello ?
OLDER GENTLEMAN: Is it the cops ?
JACK: Leonard Bidwell ?
BOXER: What 's it to you ?
JACK: I saw you fight Kid Gavilan . I like your style .
BOXER: What do you want , Mr. Policeman ?
JACK: You got a brother up in Folsom . I know because I put him there .
BOXER: Till 19-fucking-70 .
JACK: How 'd you like to make it 1960 ? I know the judge and Sergeant Exley here is friends with hte D.A .
BOXER: You wan na get me a fuckin ' snitch jacket ?
JACK: You wan na buy your brother ten years ? You do n't have to say anything . Just look at this list and point . Here .
BOXER: He 's bad , so I 'll just tell you . Sugar Ray Coates . Drives a '49 coupe , a beautiful ride . Do n't know about shotguns , but he gets his thrills killing dogs . He is ighteous trash .
JACK: That 's five minutes from here .
OLDER GENTLEMAN: I do n't understand , doll , we just got started .
LYNN: I 'm sorry , but I 'll make it up to you . I promise .
OLDER GENTLEMAN: Gosh , kitten , I do n't know As he begins to mash up against her
BUD: L.A.P.D. , shitbird . Get the fuck out of here or I 'll call your wife to come get you .
LYNN: I 've been expecting you . Pierce called . Told me what happened to Sue .
BUD: Yeah , plain scotch .
LYNN: I was friendly with Sue Lefferts , ut we were n't really friends . You know what I mean ?
BUD: Are you sorry she 's dead ?
LYNN: Of course I am . What kind of question is that ?
BUD: Have you ever heard of Dick Stensland ?
LYNN: No I have n't . Do you know why Pierce is humoring you ?
BUD: You use words like that , you might make me mad .
LYNN: Yes . But do you know ?
BUD: Yeah I know . Patchett 's running whores and judging by his address , probably something bigger on the side . He does n't want any attention .
LYNN: That 's right . Our motives are selfish , so we 're cooperating .
BUD: Why was Susan Lefferts at the Nite Owl ?
LYNN: I do n't know . I never heard of the Nite Owl till today .
BUD: Did Lefferts have a boyfriend ?
LYNN: Like I said we were friendly , not friends .
BUD: How 'd she meet Patchett ?
LYNN: Pierce meets people . Sue came on the bus with dreams of Hollywood . This is how they turned out . Thanks to Pierce , we still get to act a little .
BUD: Tell me about Patchett .
LYNN: He 's waiting for you to mention mention .
BUD: You want some advice , Miss Bracken ?
LYNN: It 's Lynn .
BUD: Miss Bracken , do n't ever try to fucking bribe me or threaten me or I 'll have you and Patchett in shit up to your ears . Lynn smiles again . She likes Bud . A beat .
LYNN: I remember you from Christmas Eve . You have a thing fo helping women , do n't you , Officer White ?
BUD: Maybe I 'm just fucking curious .
LYNN: You say 'fuck ' a lot .
BUD: You fuck for money .
LYNN: There 's blood on your shirt . Is that an integral part of your job ?
BUD: Yeah .
LYNN: Do you enjoy it ?
BUD: When they deserve it .
LYNN: Did they deserve it today ?
BUD: I 'm not sure .
LYNN: But you did it anyway .
BUD: Yeah , just like the half dozen guys you screwed today .
LYNN: Actually , it was two . You 're different , Officer White . You 're the first man in five years who did n't tell me I look like Veronica Lake inside of a minute .
BUD: You look better than Veronica Lake . Now , Pierce Patchett .
LYNN: He takes a cut of our earnings and invests it for us . He makes us quit the life at thirty . He does n't let us use narcotics and he does n't abuse us . Can you policeman 's mentality grasp those contradictions ?
BUD: He had you cut to look like Veronica Lake ?
LYNN: No . I 'm really a brunette , but the rest is me . And that 's all the news that 's fit to print .
BUD: Look . I want to see you again .
LYNN: Are you asking me for a date o an appointment ?
BUD: I do n't know .
LYNN: If it 's a date I think you 'd etter tell me your first name ecause I
BUD: Forget I asked . It was a mistake .
EXLEY: L.A.P.D .

JACK: You think golden boy can handle it , Cap ?
DUDLEY: I think you 'll be surprised what Edmund 's capable of .
EXLEY: They call you Sugar Ray because of Ray Robinson ? They say Robinson can throw a four punch combination in one second . Do you believe that ? Coates just stares at him .
COATES: Say what and so what .
EXLEY: Did one of the officers work you over a little ? No bite . Coates just stares back .
COATES: Man , why do you keep asking me that ?
EXLEY: Just getting my facts straight . Twenty-two makes it a gas chambe ounce . You should have pulled this cape a couple of years ago . Get life , do a little Youth Authority jolt , transfer to Folsom a big man . Orbit on some of that good prison ew , get yourself a sissy
COATES: I never truck with no sissies !
EXLEY: That fucking Larry . I almost elieved him .
COATES: Believed what ?
EXLEY: Nothing , Ray . That Larry , he 's a pisser . You did the Casitas Youth Camp with him , did n't you ?
COATES: Man , why 're you talkin ' about Larry ? His business is his usiness .
EXLEY: Sugar , Larry told me you went sissy up at Casitas . You could n't do the time so you found yourself a big white boy to look after you . He said they call you 'Sugar ' because you gave it out so sweet . Exley flips the toggle .
EXLEY: Ray , you protected Ty and Larry up in Casitas , did n't you ?
COATES: You ai n't woofin ' I did . Stupid down home niggers got no more sense than a fuckin ' dog . Exley flips the switches off .

COATES: Dogs got no reason to live .
EXLEY: Oh ? you feel that way about people , too ?
COATES: Man , what 're you saying ?
EXLEY: Ray , we got the shotguns .
COATES: I do n't own no shotguns .
EXLEY: Why were you throwing clothes in the building incinerator ?
COATES: Say what ?
EXLEY: You guys were arrested this morning , but none of you have last night 's clothes . You were seen burning them . Add to that the fact that you hid the ca you were cruising around in last night and it does n't look good .
COATES: I got nothin ' more to say till I see a judge .
EXLEY: Were you on hop ? You were passed out when you got arrested . Were you hopped up , Ray ?

FONTAINE: I DID N'T KILL NOBODY !
EXLEY: Why 'd you burn the clothes ?
FONTAINE: I just wanted to lose my cherry . I did n't mean to hurt her . Exley ca n't hide his surprise at this .
EXLEY: Hurt who ? Was she a hooker ? Hurt who ?
DUDLEY: Do n't get sidetracked . Stay with the Nite Owl .
EXLEY: She may still be alive , whoeve she is . Bud 's all ears .
JONES: This newspaper shit ai n't shit .
EXLEY: Where 's the girl ? Did you kill her ? No answer , but Jones looks nervous .
EXLEY: Kick loose , Jones . I know you made her bleed , but that does n't mean you killed her . No answer , but Jones is squirming .
JONES: I think she 's alive .
EXLEY: You think ? Jack turns to Dudley .
JACK: He 's good . I 'll give him that .
EXLEY: Where is she now ? Did you leave her someplace ? Did you sell her out ? Give he to some of your buddies ? Tell me where the girl is !
BUD: One in six . Where 's the girl ?

EXLEY: How 's it going to look on you eport ?
BUD: It 'll look like justice . That 's what that fat fuck got . Justice .
EXLEY: You do n't know what the word means , you dumb bastard .
CARLISLE: Is something up , Lieutenant ?
EXLEY: Nobody move !
CHIEF: We mourn the passing of a good man . The loss of Sgt . William Carlisle is the loss of his wife , his family and the entire Los Angeles Police Department
EXLEY: I need the girl to give me a chronology of events . No details . Just times .
NURSE: Absolutely not . She barely emembers her own name .
EXLEY: But
NURSE: I was told the case was closed . Should I call your superior to double-check ?
EXLEY: No . that wo n't be necessary .
OLDER GENTLEMAN: You tell Mr. Patchett I have no intention of changing my vote .
CHIEF: Edmund J. Exley has amassed a illiant record in his seven years with the L.A.P.D . Recently he evinced spectacular bravery in the line of duty . It is my hono to present him with our highest honor , the Medal of Valor .
DUDLEY: Your father would 've been proud .
EXLEY: There are loose ends out there , Dudley . I
DUDLEY: There always are . But there are also three men and three guns . Matched forensically . A few loose ends do n't matter .
EXLEY: Something 's wrong . I feel it inside . Does n't that sound crazy ?
DUDLEY: Breaking a big case sticks you in a whirlwind . A little self-doubt ? It 's natural . Just keep it inside . Between you and you .
CHASE: This election is about the future of law enforcement in Los Angeles . Ellis Loew represents that future . So dig deep and let 's get a moral man re-elected .
HUDGEONS: You 're back , boychick .
JACK: Sid , how are they hanging ?
HUDGEONS: Down around my ankles . Hudgeons scans the crowd , points someone out .
JACK: What 's he doing here , Sid ?
HUDGEONS: You tight with the D.A. , trash ?
JACK: Sure , he just tried to throw me off the force last Christmas as a little joke .
HUDGEONS: How 'd you like a little payback ? Not to mention a donation to the widows and orphans fund . Did you know Loew was a swish ?
JACK: And Reynolds ?
HUDGEONS: He 's queer too . Metro paid him two grand a week to fake it with ingenues . On screen and off . I 'm getting him to fuck the D.A . for a hundred bucks . That 's twice the fifty you got fo wrecking his career .
REYNOLDS: Have we met before ?
JACK: Yeah .
REYNOLDS: Was it a party ?
JACK: Something like that .
REYNOLDS: Oh , I know . A Fleur-de-Lis party , ight ?
JACK: Fleaur-de-Lis . 'Whatever you desire . '
REYNOLDS: Dope , liquor , hookers that look like movie stars . Pierce Patchett has it all .
JACK: Yeah . Me and Patchett go way ack .
REYNOLDS: Pierce is n't like regular people . I dig him , but he scares me too .
JACK: Really ? How ?
REYNOLDS: You know , when I came out to L.A. , this is n't exactly where I saw myself ending up .
JACK: Yeah . Me neither .
HUDGEONS: Dutch courage , kid . Drink up .
REYNOLDS: I do n't know if I should do this .
HUDGEONS: Hey , it 's not like you do n't know how . And Jack here has connections on 'Badge of Honor . ' Pull this off and there 'll be a part for you . I smell a comeback . Do n't you , Jack ?
JACK: Loew 's free . Congratulate him .
HUDGEONS: If Reynolds works his charms , which he will , this is the address where they 'll be . Meet me at midnight . I guarantee all sorts of illegal activity .
JACK: Sid , why would a guy like Pierce Patchett get involved with running dope and hookers ?
HUDGEONS: Where 'd you hear that ?
JACK: Around .
HUDGEONS: Jackie , all I know is what you know . The man is very rich . And he 's invested in freeway construction so he 's gon na get a lot richer . But that 's it . Patchett 's what I like to call 'Twilight . ' He ai n't queer , he ai n't Red , he ca n't help me in my quest for prime sinuendo .
REYNOLDS: I ca n't do it .
HUDGEONS: Talk to him , Jack . Tell him about the opening on the show .
JACK: I 'm pretty sure I can get you a part on the show But tonight ? Pretend it 's an acting job , kid . Showbiz .
REYNOLDS: And no one 'll know about this ?
JACK: It 'll be our secret .
REYNOLDS: Showbiz .
DUDLEY: Where did you intend to start . Prostitution ? Gambling ? Go back to Cleveland , lad . This is the City of Angels and you have n't got any wings .
LYNN: Did you forget some Bud stands there , filling up the door frame .
BUD: It 's Bud .
LYNN: You should see yourself . You look like you 're ten years old .
JACK: Come on , Sid . Where are you ?
HUDGEONS: Jackie ! You got some good scoop for the Sidster ?
JACK: Sid , cut the crap . I
HUDGEONS: Give me some Narco skinny . I want to put out an all hop-head issue . Shvartze jazz musicians and movie stars . Maybe tie it into the Rosenbergs . You like ?
JACK: Shut up !
HUDGEONS: What 's wrong , Trash ?
JACK: He 's dead . I was just there . Somebody slit his throat .
HUDGEONS: Jesus . Jack , that 's a story . 'Swish Actor Gets The Gay Blade . ' Let me get my camera . Hudgeons starts away , but Jack grabs him .
JACK: Loew did n't go with him . You 're sure ?
HUDGEONS: I put Reynolds in the cab myself . The night cost me a hundred scoots and I got bupkis .
BARTENDER: What 'll it be , Jack ?
JACK: A bottle of Scotch .
BARTENDER: Hey ! Your change !
BUD: Who was that guy who was here earlier ?
LYNN: It does n't matter . All they get is Veronica Lake . You got the eal Lynn Margaret Bracken Where 'd this come from ?
BUD: When I was ten , my old man threw a ottle at my mother . I guess I got in the way .
LYNN: So you saved her .
BUD: Yeah . But not for long .
LYNN: Do you like being a cop , Bud ?
BUD: I used to . What I do now is strong-arm . Sitting duck stuff No , I do n't like it . If I could work Homicide like a real detective
LYNN: You found Patchett . You found me . You 're smart enough . Be a detective if that 's what you want .
BUD: That simple , huh ? Lynn nods . That simple .
CLERK: I got the rap sheets on the black guys , sir . Coates and Jones got charges a mile long . But except for some kid stuff , Fontaine 's clean .
EXLEY: Clean ?
CLERK: More or less .
EXLEY: Until he gunned down six people .
PARK RANGER: I asked my men , Lieutenant . No one remembers any colored guys firing shotguns .
EXLEY: Then who phoned in the report ?
PARK RANGER: Not us .
PINKER: Bud White , what brings you down to the basement ?
BUD: I got a few Nite Owl questions .
PINKER: I do n't know if you read the papers , but that case is closed .
BUD: I 'm tying up loose ends . Padding my report . You know how it goes .
PINKER: What do you want to know ?
BUD: Anything off . Anything that did n't make sense .
PINKER: You mean beside the fact that thirty-five out of forty-five ounds were gratuitous ? I ca n't think of anything .
BUD: Whose shoe ?
PINKER: Susan Lefferts .
BUD: If she was sitting here , then it 's facing the wrong way . What are these smears in the blood ?
PINKER: It looks like she was flailing , trying to get away .
BUD: But she 's moving away from the door . Who was sitting at this table ?
PINKER: Dick Stensland . Had to be dumb panic . If she knew him she would 've been sitting with him Right ?
BUD: Ear plugs .
PINKER: Exactly . At least one of those animals had the brains to protect his ears .
BUD: It does n't exactly play like dum panic .
PINKER: What do you mean ?
BUD: It 's like they knew they were going to kill everyone before they went in
PINKER: Yeah , so
BUD: Mrs. Lefferts , I 'm Officer White with the L.A.P.D . I 'd like to ask a couple of questions .
MRS. LEFFERTS: Let my daughter rest in peace .
BUD: Five minutes . That 's all .
MRS. LEFFERTS: First I want to go on record as saying that my Susie was a virgin when she died .
BUD: Ma'am , I 'm sure she was .
MRS. LEFFERTS: Susie , I told you I did n't approve of that boyfriend . He was too old for you . You let him come into this house and be fresh to me . I went out one day and old Mrs. Jensen next door saw Susan 's oyfriend and another man and thought she heard a ruckus .
BUD: What was that boyfriend 's name ?
MRS. LEFFERTS: We were never properly introduced . Susan and I were fighting that day . She called him by a nickname . Muns or Lunts o something .
BUD: Stens ? Was it Stens ?
MRS. LEFFERTS: Maybe . I do n't know .
BUD: Look at a picture for me .
MRS. LEFFERTS: That 's him . That 's him .
BUD: You said a neighbor heard a uckus . Was it outside , inside ?
MRS. LEFFERTS: I do n't know . You 'll have to leave now , Officer . Bud starts for the closed door .
BUD: What 's through here ?
MRS. LEFFERTS: No ! Please leave !
MRS. LEFFERTS: Do n't mind the smell . I think a at died behind the wall My Susie was a good girl !
BUD: Easy . Tell me about the ruckus .
MRS. LEFFERTS: I came home that night and there was blood on the floor . Susan said Stams Stens had cut himself . They were acting nervous . And that Stens kept going under the house .
BUD: Buzz Meeks Holy shit .
MRS. LEFFERTS: Was it a rat ?
BUD: Yeah . A great big one .
PINKER: Hey , just in time for our stomach of the week . Frankfurters with sauerkraut , French fries , Coca-Cola , alcohol and sperm . Jesus , what a last supper .
EXLEY: The Nite Owl . Anything bothering you about the case ?
PINKER: Yeah . The fact that you guys wo n't let it get filed away .
EXLEY: What are you talking about ?
PINKER: Bud White grilled me on it this morning . You know , he 's not as dumb as I thought . As Exley 's head swims
MRS. LEFFERTS: Let my Susie rest in peace !
EXLEY: Mrs. Lefferts , I just want to ask a few questions .
MRS. LEFFERTS: That other policeman already checked under the house and found not a thing amiss .
EXLEY: Officer White ?
MRS. LEFFERTS: A sweet man .
EXLEY: Under the house .
MRS. LEFFERTS: All he found were rodents . No signs of foul play . So there .
EXLEY: I need an I.D . ASAP . You talk only to me on this one .
JACK: Yeah . Sergeant Jack Vincennes equesting . I need the home address on a Pierce Patchett .
EXLEY: I need to speak to you .
JACK: Give me a minute , will ya ? Exley clicks off the phone .
EXLEY: I want you to follow Bud White .
JACK: Even I 'm not that crazy .
EXLEY: It 's not a request . I need to know what White knows . Follow him or I 'll have you pulled off 'Badge of Honor . ' Permanently .
JACK: Yesterday that might 've meant something . Pull me off . You 'd be doing me a big favor .
EXLEY: Yesterday yes , today no . What happened last night ?
JACK: Transfer me , suspend me . Just leave me alone .
EXLEY: You make a mistake ?
JACK: Yeah . My whole life .
EXLEY: Listen , I think I made a mistake , too .
JACK: I ai n't a priest , Lieutenant . I ca n't hear your confession .
EXLEY: Do you make the three Negroes fo the Nite Owl killings ?
JACK: What ?
EXLEY: It 's a simple question .
JACK: You should be the last person who wants to dig any deeper into the Nite Owl , Lieutenant .
EXLEY: Rollo Tomasi . Jack stops , looks back at him .
JACK: Is there more to that , or do I have to guess ?
EXLEY: Rollo was a purse snatcher . My father ran into him off duty . He shot my father six times and got away clean . No one even knew who he was . I made the name up to give him some personality .
JACK: So what 's the point ?
EXLEY: Rollo 's the reason I became a cop . I wanted to catch the guys who thought they could get away with it . It was supposed to be about truth and justice and Rollo . But somewhere along the way I forgot all that How about you , Jack ? Why 'd you become a cop ?
JACK: I do n't remember Both men are quiet a moment .
EXLEY: I 've given up angles for awhile . I just want to solve this thing .
JACK: The Nite Owl was solved , Lieutenant .
EXLEY: I want to do it right . So does Jack .
JACK: Okay , college boy , I 'll help you . But I want half the collar .
EXLEY: A third . I do n't think we can make a case without Bud White .
STOMPANATO: Wendell White , how 's tricks , u > paesano ?
BUD: I ai n't your paesano , you wop cocksucker .
STOMPANATO: What do you want , officer ?
BUD: You remember an ex-cop named Buzz Meeks ? He works for a guy named Patchett .
STOMPANATO: Should I ?
BUD: His file listed you as a known associate . Now spill .
STOMPANATO: Oh , yeah . That was a long time ago . Before your day . The last few years he 's been muscle fo hire . But I heard he 's disappeared .
BUD: More .
STOMPANATO: More 's gon na cost you .
BUD: How 'bout I give you your balls ack ?
STOMPANATO: Before Meeks disappeared he was popping off about trying to move eighteen pounds of heroin .
BUD: Bullshit . Where would a two-bit ex-cop get 18 pounds of heroin ?
STOMPANATO: Deuce Perkins . Mickey C 's narcotics lieutenant . The night he got clipped , eighteen pounds of Mickey 's heroin went missing .
STOMPANATO: Meeks is probably in Rio o someplace like that by now .
BUD: He 's under a tract house in San Berdoo . And he do n't smell too good . What happened to the heroin , Johnny ?
STOMPANATO: I do n't know . I swear it !
JACK: He 's in the Brown Derby with Johnny Stompanato . Check that . I got ta go .
EXLEY: What 's that for ?
JACK: Bud White . He sees us and we 're dead .
EXLEY: Rita Hayworth at the morgue and now Veronica Lake with White . What the hell 's going on ?
JACK: Movie star hookers . Whatever you desire It 's Fleur-fr-Lis again .
EXLEY: What 's Fleur-de-Lis ?
JACK: High line whores . With plastic surgery to look like movie stars . And who knows what else ? It 's run y this guy Pierce Patchett . You want to talk to him ?
EXLEY: Yeah . But first I want to brace Stompanato .
STOMPANATO: Hey , you want an autograph , write to M-G-M .
EXLEY: Since when do two-bit hoods and hookers give out autographs ?
STOMPANATO: What ?
EXLEY: L.A.P.D . Sit down .
"LANA": Who in the hell do you think you are ?
EXLEY: Take a walk , honey , before I haul your ass downtown .
"LANA": Who in the hell do you thinkare ? !
STOMPANATO: You are making a large mistake .
"LANA": Get away from our table !
EXLEY: Shut up . Being cut to look like Lana Turner does n't mean you are Lana Turner . Jack pulls him aside .
JACK: She is Lana Turner .
EXLEY: What ?
JACK: She is Lana Turner .
EXLEY: How was I supposed to know ?
PATCHETT: I believe the Nite Owl 's your area of expertise , Mr. Exley . I saw you on television getting you medal . And you 're that other celebrity Hollywood policeman , are n't you ?
EXLEY: Bud White 's been here ?
PATCHETT: For the last time . I may suborn women into illicit activities , but they 're handsomely compensated , I treat them well and make sure the men they deal with show them every due respect .
EXLEY: Is the Veronica Lake look-alike one of your whores ?
PATCHETT: A vulgar term , but yes .
EXLEY: What 's her name ?
PATCHETT: Lynn Bracken .
EXLEY: Why 's she seeing Bud White ?
PATCHETT: Why do men and women usually see each other ?
EXLEY: Anything else you want to add efore I talk to her ?
PATCHETT: No .
EXLEY: Not good enough .
PATCHETT: Then try talking to my lawyer . Good evening , gentlemen .
JACK: Guy 's as cool as they come .
EXLEY: This is Exley .
JACK: What are you going to do ?
EXLEY: I 'm going to Lynn Bracken 's . I 'll meet you at the Dining Car .
JACK: Great . You get the girl , I get the coroner .
EXLEY: Miss Bracken , I 'm Lieutenant Exley .
LYNN: I know who you are . You 're the policeman Bud told me about .
EXLEY: Really ? What did White say ?
LYNN: He said you were smart . He also said you were competing with you dead father . How did he put it ? Trying to measure up to a ghost . Exley lets it pass . As he enters
EXLEY: Let 's concentrate on my smarts . Pierce Patchett made you , did n't he ? He taught you how to dress and talk and think and I am very impressed with the results . But I need some answers and if I do n't get them , I 'm going to take you and Patchett down .
LYNN: He can take care of himself and I 'm not afraid of you . And you forgot one thing , Lieutenant . Pierce also taught me how to fuck Can I get you a drink ?
EXLEY: Scotch .
LYNN: I 'm curious about you .
EXLEY: Why ? She hands him his drink .
LYNN: Because Bud hates you more than he loves me .
EXLEY: Do n't underestimate me , Miss Bracken .
LYNN: The way you 've underestimated Bud White ?
PINKER: God bless dental records . Stiff used to be a cop . Turner Meeks .
JACK: Buzz Meeks ?
PINKER: You knew him ?
JACK: Of him . He was around when I first joined the force . A bad egg .
EXLEY: How was I ?
LYNN: Oh , the best I ever had . Absolutely the best .
EXLEY: You sound like you mean it .
LYNN: The silver screen 's loss is you gain .
EXLEY: How about White ?
LYNN: You want to know what Bud 's like in bed ? She actually embarrasses him with that one .
EXLEY: I want to know why you see him . Is it a Patchett payoff ?
LYNN: I see Bud because I want to . I see Bud because he ca n't hide the warmth he has inside him .
EXLEY: I 'll take your word for it .
LYNN: I see Bud because he makes me feel like Lynn Bracken and not some Veronica Lake look-alike who fucks for money . I see him because he does n't know how to disguise who he is . There 's more if you want to hear it . Exley shakes his head . He 's heard enough .
EXLEY: I do n't hate White . I really do n't . It 's just , in my business , it 's the wild cars you have to watch out for .
LYNN: You do n't like that you do n't know how to play him . He does n't follow the same rules of politics you do . That makes him dangerous .
EXLEY: You cut to the heart of things , do n't you ? What about Lynn Bracken ? She going to be a hooke all her life ?
LYNN: I came out here with a dream . That 's gone , but I settled fo eality .
EXLEY: Some reality .
LYNN: No . This is the means to the eality . But I 'm not going to tell you what it is .
EXLEY: Why not ?
LYNN: Because you 'll use it against me . Wo n't you ?
EXLEY: You 're the first person to eve call me tough .
LYNN: Like recognizes like . I 'm pretty tough , myself .
EXLEY: You , me and White , huh ?
LYNN: Actually , Bud 's only tough on the outside . As Exley kisses her
DUDLEY: John Vincennes . It 's three A.M. , lad .
JACK: Two minutes , Dudley . It 's important .
DUDLEY: Lucky for you that my wife and four fair daughters are at the each in Santa Barbara .
JACK: You remember Buzz Meeks , Dudley ?
DUDLEY: A disgrace as a policeman . Straight D fitness reports from every C.O . he ever served under . What about him ?
JACK: Twelve years ago he worked a vice oust with Dick Stensland . They arrested a Pierce Patchett on an extortion scam . Guy ran hookers . He 'd have them photographed with their johns , then double-dip fo some blackmail . Charges got dropped . Insufficient evidence . You were supervising officer on the case and I was wondering if you remember anything about it .
DUDLEY: What 's this all about , lad ?
JACK: Part of it has to do with a murder . I 've been working with Ed Exley on it .
DUDLEY: You 're Narco , lad , not Homicide . And since when do you work with Edmund ?
JACK: It 's a private investigation . I fucked something up and I want to make amends .
DUDLEY: Do n't start trying to do the right thing , John . You have n't had enough practice . Dudley walks over , hands Jack his coffee .
JACK: No .
DUDLEY: Not even with Exley ?
JACK: Have you a valediction , lad ?
DUDLEY: Sergeant Vincennes ' body was found in Echo Park at ten o'clock this morning . Killed by a single .38 ound to the heart . One of ou own , gentlemen . We can not tolerate it . Justice must be swift and merciless . That 's all . As the men move odd , Dudley approaches Exley .
EXLEY: No Where 'd the tip come from ?
DUDLEY: Anonymous . Probably nothing .
BUD: What work ?
DUDLEY: I 've long been involved in containing hard crime in such a way that myself and a few colleagues might someday enjoy a profit dispensation . That day will soon be here and you 'll share handsomely . Grand means will be in our hands , Wendell .
BUD: You lost me , Dudley . I do n't know what you 're talking about .
DUDLEY: You have your extracurricula secrets , I have mine . We 'll hold a clarification session soon . Fo now , I need your fearsome old habits at the Victory Motel . We 're going to brace a man who may know who killed Jack Vincennes . Can I count on you ?
BUD: Sure , boss . Sure you can .
EXLEY: I want to know what you and Jack Vincennes talked about last night . Anything and everything . Start with the I.D . on the corpse . A put-upon Pinker sighs .
PINKER: An ex-cop . Buzz Meeks . I pulled his police academy photo .
EXLEY: We got a dead ex-cop and a girl who looks like Rita Hayworth at the Nite Owl . Another dead ex-cop under the house of Rita 's mother . It 's not a good week for ex-cops .
PINKER: I got Vincennes in the next room . It 's not a good week for cops in general .
DUDLEY: This is Mr. Hudgeons , Wendell .
HUDGEONS: I 'm happy to cooperate . You do n't need to tie me down .
DUDLEY: It 's for your own safety . Now what can you tell us about Sergeant John Vincennes ?
HUDGEONS: Trashcan Jack . The Big V. I can tell you he 's on the Night Train to the big adios .
DUDLEY: But you were business associates ?
HUDGEONS: What does that have to do Breuning cuffs him again .
DUDLEY: Alright . We 'll drop that line fo now . Next topic . Please comment on Pierce Patchett . Bud looks over at mention of the name .
HUDGEONS: You think he had something to do with Vincennes getting iced ? Dudley sighs , looks to Bud .
DUDLEY: Wendell . I want full and docile cooperation on all topics .
HUDGEONS: Okay . Okay . Everyone knows Patchett 's worth a boat-load of greenbacks . From aviation , freeway construction . But the man has hobbies , too . He bankrolls B movies under the table and runs movie star look-alike hookers . And try this on he 's rumored to e a periodic heroin sniffer . All in all a powerful behind-the- scenes strange-o .
DUDLEY: And ?
HUDGEONS: And what ?
DUDLEY: Reciprocity , Mr. Hudgeons , is the key to all relationships .
HUDGEONS: He runs call girls . Primo tail . Fixed up like movie stars .
DUDLEY: And ?
HUDGEONS: In my car . Blackmail shit . The trunk under the carpet . Patchett got me to photograph a cop fucking this gorgeous cunt Lynn , looks just like Veronicaaa
DUDLEY: Wendell !
HUDGEONS: Get him away from me ! Bud breaks free , heads outside .
DUDLEY: I would n't trade places with Edmund Exley right now for all the tea in China . Breuning laughs . So does Hudgeons .
HUDGEONS: Dudley , I thought you were gon na let the dumb bastard kill me . And you ! Learn to pull those punches a little better .
DUDLEY: Hush-hush As Breuning and Carlisle move in
EXLEY: Anything ?
CLERK: Nothing .
EXLEY: So on active duty , Meeks did n't make an arrest from 1938 to '43 .
CLERK: Someone must 've pulled the ecords .
EXLEY: Where are the police academy files ?
CLERK: I do n't have time . I have
EXLEY: Just show me where they are !
BUD: Did you talk to Exley ?
LYNN: Come in out of the rain . In the morning we 'll have both ou stories for breakfast . Lightning flashes . Bud shakes hs head .
BUD: I want to know about Exley .
LYNN: He 's the opposite of you . He 's more like me . Cold , calculating .
BUD: How 'd you get to know so much about him ? More lightning . Lynn looks God-awful sad .
LYNN: Come in out of the rain , Bud .
BUD: You gon na tell me what happened with you and Exley ?
LYNN: We talked .
BUD: So tell me about it .
LYNN: In the morning .
BUD: No . Now . You fucked him .
LYNN: I thought I was helping you . I thought
EXLEY: Why ?
BUD: Lynn .
EXLEY: She told you ?
BUD: I knew Stensland and Meeks knew each other . Meeks was with Sue Lefferts on Christmas Eve . The night I met Lynn . Lefferts ' mother I.D.ed Stensland as Lefferts ' boyfriend , but Stens pretended he did n't know eithe one of them .
EXLEY: Stensland and Meeks . What were they up to ?
BUD: Johnny Stompanato told me when Meeks disappeared , he was trying to move the 18 pounds of heroin that went missing when Deuce Perkins was shot .
EXLEY: Stensland and Buzz Meeks . Two-man triggers knocking off Mickey Cohen lieutenants . When they killed Deuce Perkins , they got heroin as a bonus .
BUD: Then something goes wrong . Meeks gets killed . Maybe Stens got greedy , killed Meeks and left him under his girlfriend 's house . The night he died , Stens was all mysterious . Said he had something ig going down .
EXLEY: The Nite Owl ! Stensland was going there to sell the heroin .
BUD: Somebody got wind of it , killed them all .
EXLEY: It was n't the Negroes . The Griffith Park report was a phony . And , who says the purple Merc was spotted outside the Nite Owl ?
BUD: Dudley .
EXLEY: The first guys to the car when Jack and I got there were Bruening and Carlisle .
BUD: Dudley 's guys .
EXLEY: They did n't find the shotguns . They planted them .
BUD: It all keeps coming back to Dudley .
EXLEY: It 's Dudley for the Nite Owl .
BUD: Let 's just kill them .
EXLEY: What ?
BUD: For Jack , for Stensland , fo anybody else who got in the way . I 've been trying to be smart . A detective . But killing those two fuckers , that would be justice .
EXLEY: Stay smart , Bud . We build a case . We play by the rules .
BUD: There are no rules ! Why the fuck are you doing this ? The Nite Owl made you . You want to tear all that down .
EXLEY: With a wrecking ball . You want to help me swing it ? Bud smiles . For a second he likes Exley .
BUD: Which one are you and which one am
EXLEY: You expecting problems ?
BUD: Patchett uses a lot of ex-cop muscle .
BUD: Come on .
EXLEY: What ?
EXLEY: I do n't think his ex-cop did him much good .
BUD: He had help getting up there . Two of his fingers are broken .
EXLEY: We had one thing figured wrong . I do n't think Dudley workd fo Patchett .
BUD: At least not anymore .
EXLEY: Patchett 's dead . He sent you after me . I 'd say Dudley 's tying up his loose ends .
BUD: u > Lynn .
EXLEY: I got a guy who owes me in the Sheriff 's department . West Hollywood station . He can be at her house in two minutes . Bud shoves the phone into his hand .
BUD: Call him .
EXLEY: Is she inside ?
DEPUTY: We took her to Hollywood Station for safekeeping . Someone worked her over pretty good . She would n't say who . Exley looks at Bud . Bud looks down in shame .
EXLEY: Hold her as Joan Smith . No one sees her unless I okay it .
DEPUTY: You got it , Exley . And now we 're even . As the Deputy moves off .
EXLEY: Ellis Loew .
BUD: What about him ?
EXLEY: Jack thought he was up to his neck in all this .
SECRETARY: You ca n't go in there !
SECRETARY: Do you want me to call the police , Mr. Loew ?
EXLEY: Ask for Captain Dudley Smith . We 'll have a party . Hot dogs and sauerkraut . A beat as Loew considers his options .
LOEW: It 's okay . These are police . u > What do you want ?
EXLEY: I want D.A . bureau men to tail Dudley Smith twenty-four hours a day ; I want you to get a judge to authorize a wire tap on his home phone ; I want authorization to check his bank records and I want it all in an hour .
LOEW: On what evidence ?
EXLEY: None . Call it a hunch .
LOEW: Absolutely not . Dudley Smith is a highly decorated member of this city 's police department and I wo n't smear his name without
EXLEY: Without what , his smearing yours first ? What 's he got on you , Loew ? Pictures of you and an out of work actor with your pants down ?
LOEW: Do you have any proof ?
EXLEY: The proof had his throat slit . So far you 're not denying it .
LOEW: I 'm not going to dignify youwith answers . If you 'll excuse me , I 've got a Jack Vincennes press conference to prepare for .
LOEW: Unless you 're here to wipe my ass , I think we 're through .
BUD: Dudley Smith . Spill .
LOEW: Call him off , Exley !
EXLEY: I do n't know how .
EXLEY: Bud
BUD: If I let you go , there 'll be ten more lawyers to take your place tomorrow . They just wo n't come on the bus , that 's all .
LOEW: Okay ! You 're right ! Dudley 's got photos of me and Reynolds .
EXLEY: What 's Dudley 's scheme ?
LOEW: Dudley 's rotten to the core . He 's taking over Mickey Cohen 's ackets , his own hand-picked cops 'll be the new franchise holders . Because of those pictures I wo n't be able to prosecute . Oh Jesus pull me up !
LOEW: Dudley 's got everyone under his thumb . Not just me , but the Chief of Police , the lieutenant governor , everybody !
EXLEY: Not everybody . You tip-off Dudley and Officer White visits you alone next time .
BUD: They never made a match on the shotgun serial numbers . What if Breuning and Carlisle took them from the evidence room ? Couple of cold pieces that had been hanging around a year or two .
EXLEY: We should check the records , and , we should talk to Lynn . Bud just stares at him a beat .
BUD: You do it . I 'll check the files .
LYNN: If I knew you were coming I 'd have aked a cake .
EXLEY: Forget everything else for a second , Lynn . Is there anything you can give me on Dudley Smith ? A blank look from her .
LYNN: I work for Patchett . I had a feeling that there was someone else , but I never knew who .
EXLEY: Okay . Look , if it helps , Bud hates himself for what he did .
LYNN: I know how he feels .
EXLEY: I do n't know if it 's pathetic o omantic , but when this is all over I 'd like to see you again .
RECORDER: I got your guns , Bud . Signed in April 3rd , 1950 . Remember the First Western bank robbery ? They were used in that .
BUD: I want to see them .
RECORDER: No can do . I ca n't find them . As Bud thinks , a ROOKIE-TYPE approaches .
BUD: What ?
BUD: You wanted to meet here ?
EXLEY: Me ? You called it . I got a message that
BUD: Too late .
EXLEY: You figured this was a set-up ? And you showed up anyway ?
BUD: A lot of bad stuff happened here . It 's as good a place as any for it to end .
EXLEY: You know , all I ever wanted was to measure up to my father .
BUD: I spent years trying not to live down to mine .
EXLEY: We got him !
DUDLEY: I 'm loathe to kill my brothe officers , Edmund .
EXLEY: Tell that to Jack Vincennes . To Stensland .
DUDLEY: Jack was a shame , but Dick Stensland had the audacity to try to sell me my own heroin . Through his whore girl friend . I sent him to make the buy . The rest is history .
EXLEY: Why ?
DUDLEY: A vacuum , Edmund . That 's what we have in Los Angeles . Sending Mickey Cohen up created it . My containment work maintained it . Certain photographs guarantee it . Organized crime has been held ack , but there 's still a demand for the services it provides .
EXLEY: And now you 'll provide them .
DUDLEY: Absolutely . Prostitution and gambling are victimless crimes . The heroin we 'll run down to the coloreds . Anesthetize them . As long as it 's not a middle class problem , no one will care . It 's still a crime free city fo espectable people .
EXLEY: No .
DUDLEY: Why not , lad ? Absolute justice ?
EXLEY: Something like that .
DUDLEY: Really ? Would you be willing to ig crime scene evidence to support a prosecuting attorney 's working hypothesis ? Exley does n't answer . Dudley smiles .
EXLEY: Yes . I do . As Exley begins
EXLEY: That 's it . That 's the whole story .
LOEW: The press would have a field day with this .
CHIEF: When in doubt , feed them a hero . In this case , we 'll need more than one .
EXLEY: I tried to throw it all away and they give it back in spades .
LYNN: Bisbee , Arizona . The air 's good for pensioners and I know where everything is .
EXLEY: When ?
LYNN: Right now , before I back down .
EXLEY: Where is he ?
LYNN: We should go now .
EXLEY: Do you think I ever could 've been in the running ?
LYNN: Some men get the world . Others get ex-hookers and a trip to Arizona .
MIA: and I swear to God , she was wrecked . It was pure insanity .
CUSTOMER #1: This does n't taste like almond milk .
MIA: Do n't worry , it is . I know sometimes it
CUSTOMER #1: Can I see the carton ? Mia hands it over . The Customer looks .
WOMAN: Cappuccino , please .

LAURA: I wonder why . I brought you this . It 's a throw rug .

LAURA: You did not get `` Shanghai'ed '' , you got ipped off .
SEBASTIAN: What 's the difference ?
LAURA: It 's not as romantic as that . And everyone knew that guy was shady except for you .
SEBASTIAN: Why do you say romantic like it 's a dirty word ?
LAURA: Unpaid bills are not romantic . Call her .
SEBASTIAN: You 're acting like life 's got me on the opes what you do n't understand is , I want to be on the ropes . I 'm letting life hit me ` til it gets tired . Then I 'm gon na make my move . It 's a classic rope-a-dope .
LAURA: I love you . Unpack your boxes .

SEBASTIAN: I 'll stick to the set list , I promise
BOSS: Too late . You 're done .

MIA: `` Curt '' ?
SEBASTIAN: Ok I was an asshole . I can admit that . Revision 18 .
MIA: Ok .
SEBASTIAN: But requesting `` I Ran '' from a serious musician it 's too far .
MIA: My God . Did you just call yourself `` a serious musician '' ?
SEBASTIAN: I do n't think so .
MIA: Can I borrow what you 're wearing ?
SEBASTIAN: Why ?
MIA: Because I have an audition next week . I 'm playing a serious fire-fighter .
SEBASTIAN: So you 're an actress . That makes sense . Have I seen you in anything ?

SEBASTIAN: You did n't give me much of a choice .
MIA: Strange that we keep running into each other .
SEBASTIAN: It is strange . Maybe it means something .
MIA: I doubt it .
SEBASTIAN: Yeah I do n't think so either . Revision 21 .
MIA: What ?
SEBASTIAN: It turns your head into an antenna . Probably gives you cancer , but you find your car more quickly .
MIA: Uh-huh .
SEBASTIAN: You do n't live as long , but you get things done faster , so it all evens out .

MIA: Uh-huh . How 'd you get on the lot ?
SEBASTIAN: Piece of cake .
MIA: I 'm off in ten .
SEBASTIAN: Great . I 'll hide in the bathroom .
MIA: That 's the window Ingrid Bergman and Humphrey Bogart looked out of in Casablanca . Sebastian nods . They start walking .
SEBASTIAN: What 's your Bogart 's name ? Is it Greg ?
MIA: Yeah . Greg .
SEBASTIAN: How long have ?
MIA: We 've been seeing each other for a few months .
SEBASTIAN: I know what you mean . I get breakfast five miles out of the way just to sit outside a jazz club .
MIA: Oh yeah ?
SEBASTIAN: It was called Van Beek . The swing bands played there . Count Basie . Chick Webb . It 's a samba-tapas place now .
MIA: A what ?
SEBASTIAN: Samba-tapas . It 's Exactly . The joke 's on history . Mia laughs .
MIA: We need to wait here .
SEBASTIAN: I know . They shoot movies on my street . `` C-stands . '' `` Apple box . '' `` Do n't forget to sign out . '' Mia laughs . A beat .
MIA: Into ? Oh I my aunt was an actress . She was in this traveling theater company And there was this little library across the street from my house when I was growing up . This was Boulder City , Nevada every house looked exactly the same . I was ten and already I needed to get out . And one day , my aunt flew into town , and she showed me the library 's old-movie section . We spent a whole day watching one after the other . Bringing Up Baby . Notorious . Casablanca . I never knew the world was so big .
SEBASTIAN: Who would you invite to watch ? You parents ?
MIA: God no I did n't invite anyone . That would have been terrifying .
SEBASTIAN: ` Cause the world needs more lawyers .
MIA: Well it does n't need more actresses .
SEBASTIAN: You 're not just an actress .
MIA: What do you mean , `` just an actress '' ?
SEBASTIAN: You said it yourself , you 're a child- prodigy playwright .
MIA: That is not what I said .
SEBASTIAN: You 're too modest to say it but it 's true . So you could write your own roles . Write something that 's as interesting as you are .
MIA: Last thing I wrote was a stand-up routine for an open-mic night . It was horrible .
SEBASTIAN: All I 'm saying is Louis Armstrong could have played the marching-band charts he was given . What did he do instead ? He made history .
MIA: Ok , I 'll stop auditioning and make history instead . Sebastian laughs .
SEBASTIAN: Yeah ? Revision 28 .
MIA: I hate jazz . Sebastian stops . Turns to her .
SEBASTIAN: What does that mean ? `` I hate jazz '' ?
MIA: It means when I listen to it I do n't like it .
SEBASTIAN: But it 's such a blanket statement . It 's like saying `` I hate animals '' .
MIA: I do hate some animals .
SEBASTIAN: Do you need to be anywhere right now ?
MIA: I thought it was just Kenny G .
SEBASTIAN: What ?
MIA: I associate it with facials . It 's elaxing .
SEBASTIAN: It 's not relaxing ! Sid Bechet got into a gunfight ` cause somebody told him he played a wrong note ! Revision 29 .
MIA: Right , but it 's good to talk over . Where I grew up there 's this jazz station they 'd play at cocktail parties wheneve they served the salami and cheese .
SEBASTIAN: Mia . These are things you ca n't unsay .
MIA: Your club ?
SEBASTIAN: It 's gon na be the old Van Beek . I 'm getting the lease back . It 'll be perfect .
MIA: Hi , I just missed a call
SEBASTIAN: Really ? For what ?
MIA: That show I told you about .
SEBASTIAN: Dangerous Minds meets The O.C . ?
MIA: Right . It 's actually more like Rebel Without a Cause .
SEBASTIAN: That 's amazing ! `` I got the bulletsssss ! ''
MIA: Obviously . No .
SEBASTIAN: What ? You 're the movie person .
MIA: It 's the one I lie about .
SEBASTIAN: Come on . You ca n't do this audition and never see Rebel . The theater near me 's playing it . If you want I can take you . For research .
MIA: Ok . Revision 31 .
SEBASTIAN: 10pm Monday at the Rialto . Cool ?
MIA: Ok. For research .
ASSISTANT: Mia Dolan ?
DIRECTOR: Whenever you 're ready .
MIA: Two options . Follow my rules , or follow my rules . Kapish ? You want to bully , you 'd best be ready to get bullied
DIRECTOR: Thanks . Mia is taken aback .
MIA: I can do it another way
DIRECTOR: No , thanks , that was great . We linger on Mia for a moment , and then
ALEXIS: Mia ?
GREG: Hey I 'm parked out front . But we should hurry , my brother just landed .
MIA: Shit . No . Yes . I 'll change
GREG: It 's ok .
JOSH: That 's right but now we 've got a surround-sound set-up , so it 's like
FIANCEE: It 's like being in a movie theater .
JOSH: It 's better than going to a theater , eally . You know theaters these days
GREG: Oh , sure
JOSH: they 're so dirty , and they 're eithe too hot or too cold , and there 's always people talking , which is just just so annoying , I mean you 're trying to watch a movie one second Hello ?
FIANCEE: Probably work .
JOSH: Yeah , I 'll have to call you back . So , yeah , we love it . Awkward silence . Mia has n't spoken a word .
GREG: I 've never heard anyone say that . Was it amazing ? Revision 36 .
JOSH: Oh my God . A five-star jungle eco-resort . It was unbelievable .
GREG: Mia ? looks at Greg
MIA: I 'm sorry .
TRACY: Is that gon na happen every time ?
MIA: I think so .
SEBASTIAN: Keith ? Revision 41 .

SEBASTIAN: Good for you .
KEITH: Looking for keys .
SEBASTIAN: I 'm good .
KEITH: You sure ? It pays . Sebastian looks at Keith . A moment .
SEBASTIAN: I 'm good . Keith almost smiles . Expected this .
KEITH: Let 's just grab a drink then . Call me . It 's been too long .
SEBASTIAN: You bet .
KEITH: Nice meeting you , Mia . Revision 42 .
MIA: Nice meeting you .
SEBASTIAN: It 's beautiful .
MIA: You 're just saying that .
SEBASTIAN: No I 'm not .
MIA: I do n't know Is the whole thing too nostalgic ?
SEBASTIAN: That 's the point .
MIA: But do you think people will like it ?
SEBASTIAN: Fuck ` em .
MIA: You always say that .
SEBASTIAN: I truly believe it .
MIA: Fine as long as you sit front-row ` cause I 'll probably throw up on the middle of the stage otherwise .
SEBASTIAN: I 'll be front-row .
MIA: I made something for you .
SEBASTIAN: What 's that ?
MIA: It could be the name design . On the door .
SEBASTIAN: Why does it say `` Seb 's '' ?
MIA: That 's what you should name it .
SEBASTIAN: Never .
MIA: Sebastian , no one 's going to a club called `` Chicken on a Stick '' .
SEBASTIAN: You do n't get it . Charlie Parker got the name `` Bird '' because he loved chicken . So my club 's gon na be old-school jazz and beer and chicken . `` Chicken on a Stick '' .
MIA: No . Drop the chicken . Drinks and jazz . And it 's time to start looking for othe places .
SEBASTIAN: It 's got ta be Van Beek . I ca n't let them samba all over its history .
MIA: Make your own history .
SEBASTIAN: Your play 's incredible .
MIA: I 'm doing that . They laugh .
SEBASTIAN: Which guy ?
MIA: The one who offered you a gig .
SEBASTIAN: You mean Keith ? He 's the worst .
MIA: Why was it weird between you two ?
SEBASTIAN: It 's always weird with him .
MIA: He did offer you a job .
SEBASTIAN: Right
MIA: Are you going to call him ?
SEBASTIAN: No . A beat .
MIA: Ok A moment passes . They lie down , side by side .
SEBASTIAN: Here 's what we know . It 's definitely Chicken on a Stick and your play is going to be a triumph .
KEITH: Sebastian . Sebastian approaches .
SEBASTIAN: Well Here I am . A moment . Then
KEITH: Here 's the deal . We 've got distribution with Universal , got our own imprint . We 're about to go on the road . We can cut you in for 1K a week while we tour , plus an equal share of any merchandise o ticket revenue that comes in . Sound good ? We see Sebastian 's face . Taken aback .
SEBASTIAN: Yeah , thatthat sounds good . A moment . Keith smiles .
KEITH: Let 's play , see how it feels .
SEBASTIAN: You 're holding onto the past . But jazz is about the future . A moment . Then
KEITH: I get it . I got it wrong . Last guy was n't as good as you . But you 're a pain in the ass , man .
LAURA: Look at him watch
HARRY: Hey . I 'm grabbing some pastries , you two want anything ?
MIA: Thanks Harry , I 'm good . Revision 52 .

LAURA: You should come over tonight . Harry 's cooking , but do n't let that stop you . What 's the matter ?
MIA: Nothing
LAURA: You miss him .
MIA: I guess . I 'm adapting .
LAURA: I got used to being alone . Growing up it was just me and Seb . We only had each other .
MIA: He told me .
LAURA: I was n't looking for anybody . Then I met Harry and we just fit You 've changed Seb . You know that ?
MIA: Do you think he 's happy ?
LAURA: Is he happy ?
MIA: I mean with the band , the travel , all of it . Revision 53 . Laura shrugs .
LAURA: Our dad never got to do what he wanted . We were always treading water , he took a job running a washer-dryer store . But every night at home he 'd play his clarinet along to a Benny Goodman record . So I look at Sebastian Playing music , getting paid for it . I 'm happy for him .
HARRY: Oh , right I 'll eat it I guess .
LAURA: No I changed my mind .
MIA: Hey it 's me Not sure where you are maybe Boston ? Or Dallas ? Anyway I have n't heard from you in a while I miss you Ok Bye She hangs up . Resumes typing . Revision 54 .
SEBASTIAN: Surprise .
MIA: Stay . He smiles .
SEBASTIAN: How 's the play going ?
MIA: I 'm nervous . Revision 55 .
SEBASTIAN: Why ?
MIA: Because What if people show up ?
SEBASTIAN: Fuck ` em ! Laughter . Then
MIA: I 'm nervous to be up on a stage and perform in front of people . I 'm terrified .

MAURICE: Maybe one day after you 've been married twenty years you 'll understand .
ADELLE: Uncle Maurice I spent all ou frequent flyer miles on a one way ticket here I have a rented ca outside , just listen to me . Come back with me now , and if you still want to do something like this in a year maybe we 'll plan a car trip across the country Gerald and I will come along
MAURICE: I have to walk by myself all the way every inch .
ADELLE: It 's impossible .
MAURICE: It 's what she asked for It 's what I 'm going to do .
ADELLE: She was being symbolic . What if she asked you to fly to the moon ?
MAURICE: You 'd be visiting me at Nasa .
ADELLE: What if you do n't make it ?
MAURICE: I 'll make it .
ADELLE: If you really want to do this plan it out . Rest up . Train fo it . Build up your body . Plan every stop along the way . How much money ? Time ? Really do it properly . This is all so by the seat of your pants .
MAURICE: No it 's not .
ADELLE: Why did you take the back roads here ? They 're not safe . You 'd know that if you 'd planned . Beat .
MAURICE: I 've all ready gone six hundred miles I ca n't do it again .
ADELLE: If you ca n't redo these six hundred miles when you 're rested and ready , how are you possible going to walk another two thousand-five hundred miles in your present condition ?
MAURICE: Nothing 's going to happen .
ADELLE: Uncle , the way I was told , if that police car did n't happen down that oad , you would be dead right now . That guy Denny , had jumped bail in another state , he 's dangerous They 'll be other Dennys , if you do n't plan .

ELLEN: Maurice ! Maurice ! Come out here .
MAURICE: I do n't believe it . Ellen hugs Maurice .
ELLEN: All he needed was love . Once you have that , you can do anything .
MAURICE: You 'll be all right . A couple days and you 'll be up there again .
ADELLE: Yes I understand , it does sound humorous , but this is a very serious situation .
GERALD: This smells good .
ADELLE: Why am I such an authority ?
GERALD: Here comes the resume .
ADELLE: I received my B.S . from the University of Pennsylvania , my P.H.D . from Bryn Mawr College . I worked three years at the Boston University School of Medicine , during which time I had articles printed in the `` Journal of Educational Psychology '' , `` American Journal of Psychology '' , `` Psychology Review '' and `` Science '' So I think it 's safe to say my opinion is valid .
GERALD: Adelle
ADELLE: He says he admires him .

TANDY: This guy 's not a murderer .
HANSEN: If he is , half the town has seen us take him out for dinner like a couple of jack-asses . That makes Tandy think .
TANDY: Do it quick .
HANSEN: A marriage certificate ? Who the hell carries their marriage certificate around ?
TANDY: Maurice and Ellen Parker it was issued in Philly Mr. Maurice Parker has come a long way from home . Why ?

FATHER: To where ?
MAURICE: Pacifica , California .

MAURICE: Philadelphia , Pennsylvania .
FATHER: I see .
MAURICE: Do you believe a person 's soul lives on after their death ?
FATHER: Most certainly .
MAURICE: And that that soul takes part of the person they were on this earth with them .
FATHER: That 's a reasonable assumption .
MAURICE: I do n't want my wife 's soul having any doubts .
FATHER: Doubts ? About what ?
MAURICE: About my love for her .
FATHER: You do n't have to prove anything to her .
MAURICE: I 'm not proving to her . I 'm showing her . And I know I do n't have to . I want to . I 've ealized , love is about giving . I 'm alive , I can still give to her . I want to give her everything I can .
FATHER: I want you to stay here a few days until you 're better . You 're no use to your wife in this condition . The father moves for the curtain .
MAURICE: You think I 'm crazy too . The father turns and smiles warmly .
FATHER: I have spent my life dedicated to love . Love of God . Love of humanity . And here you are living through love . Bathing in it . Using its strength , its magic , its ability to overcome any barrier If you are crazy , I hope my insanity is not far off . Maurice 's eyes well up instantly .

ISAAC: You know what I remembered you were here and I woke up .
MAURICE: Your parents would want you to be in bed .
ISAAC: You tell stories ?
MAURICE: Oh no I 'm not good at that . Very bad in fact
ISAAC: You know what maybe I ran onto the field and hit a home run .
MAURICE: Who 's telling this story ? Isaac points to Maurice .
ISAAC: That 's me .
MAURICE: Right . But everyone saw how small Isaac was and laughed but not Big Billy . He stared at Isaac carefully and then told him to join the game . It came to the end of the game . It was the eleventh o twelfth inning or whatever is the last inning of a game
ISAAC: Nine .
MAURICE: Okay nine . Big Billy 's team was losing and he was on base . That 's when Isaac came up . He could arely hold the bat Big Billy winked at Isaac The ball was pitched Isaac hit the ball hard . It soared up and out over the stadium . Everyone cheered . Isaac hit a home run and won the game . After the game , Isaac asked Big Billy why he let he play . Big Billy smiled and said , I was n't always Big Billy , I was Little Billy first Isaac and Big Billy went off after the game and read a classic book together . The end .
ISAAC: You know what that was a really good story Tell it again .

MAURICE: Can it kill me ?
DR. RAY: It can , but it 'll have to wait in line . This surprises Maurice .

DR. RAY: We operate . We find the artery in the brain and close the bleeding I just did this procedure on a Senator and he 's doing fine .
MAURICE: What are the odds ? Do I have a fifty-fifty chance of surviving the operation ?
DR. RAY: It 's hard to say . It 's a delicate surgery . There 's no getting around the fact that it 's a very high-risk situation .
MAURICE: Then it 'll have to wait until I finish .
ADELLE: What ?
MAURICE: I finish the walk , and then we may take all the chances we want .

KRIS: I do .
MAURICE: Why in God 's name did you fly all the way here then ?
KRIS: Do n't do this .
MAURICE: To look me in the eye and say what 's important to you is n't as important to me ? To tell me you know what 's best ? To tell me life is more precious than what I feel for my wife ?
KRIS: Mr. Parker , you can yell at me , if it 'll help . But I 'm not risking your life .
MAURICE: It 's mine to risk . Maurice turns to the window away from Kris .
KRIS: Your operation is scheduled fo Friday . I 'll be back before then . Kris walks to the door and stops .

My patient comes back goes nuts when she hears that Mac has been in the sewer for over 48 hours . Apparently the cop who found the dog did n't want to get his pants dirty . And neither did anyone else . So of course , my patient decides to go in after it she falls breaks her hip and lands next to her dead dog , who died of toxic fumes down there

DORR: You see , madam , I am currently on sabbatical from the institution where I teach the University of Mississippi at Hattiesburg . I am taking a year off to indulge my passion I do n't believe that is too strong a word for the music of the Renaissance . I perform in and have the honor of directing a period instrument ensemble that performs at Renaissance fairs and other cultural fora
MRS. MUNSON: Wait a minute . You got some kind of and ?
DORR: The word `` band '' would be , in this context , something of an anachronism . Though we do play together hence the word `` ensemble '' the nature of the music is such that one would hesitate to apply the epithet `` band '' with its connotations of jangling hythm and ear-popping amplification .
MRS. MUNSON: So you do n't play hippity-hop , `` I Left My Wallet in El Segundo , '' songs with the titles spelt all funny ?
DORR: Madam , I shudder . I quake . The evulsion I feel for modern popula music , and all other manifestations of contemporary decay , is , I have no doubt , the equal of y'own . Why , we play music that was composed to the greater glory of God . Devotional music . Church music .
MRS. MUNSON: Gospel music ?
DORR: Well-inspired by the gospels , certainly . The vintage , of course , is no more recent than the Rococo .
MRS. MUNSON: Rococo , huh ? Well , I guess that 'd be okay .
DORR: But I certainly do n't propose to inflict our rehearsals on you . May I enquire do you have a root cellar ?
MRS. MUNSON: Little dank , ai n't it ?
DORR: Oh , indeed , but that only improves the acoustics He experimentally claps his hands .
MRS. MUNSON: You containing it okay .
DORR: Allow me to pay you a week in advance . Allow me to pay you two weeks in advance . Allow me to pay you a month in advance . I can not countenance the thought of these charming apartments eing tenanted by someone unappreciative of their special je ne sais quoi .
MRS. MUNSON: That would be a shame .
WEEMACK: You would n't believe this shit , sometimes even out here on the casino floor you gon na find sanitary napkin shit stuck there , Tucks , I do n't know what the fuck people do while they 're gambling here man .
GAWAIN: I ai n't peelin ' funky shit with my human hands , man . That 's a prescription for disease and viruses and shit , attackin ' y'insides .
WEEMACK: You got ta do it . Mr. Gudge checks everything . Man is a motherfuck . Shit looka this .
GAWAIN: Fuck that , man . I ai n't pawin ' through used Tucks for a fi ' dollar chip .
WEEMACK: I said it was a hundred .
GAWAIN: Man , your guts gon na turn to soup ' n leak outcha fuckin ' asshole .
WEEMACK: This tunnel leads back onto land . To the office for all the people work for Mannex . Mannex Corporation . Owns the Lady Luck ' n three other boats
GUDGE: Funthes . How 's the new man ?
WEEMACK: He is a cleaning motherfucker , man !
GUDGE: Is that a fact .
PANCAKE: Scrub two ! Scrub three ! Four , Mountain !
DIRECTOR: Props !
PANCAKE: Okay . Okay . We 're prepared for that
DIRECTOR: What the hell is this ? Pancake 's manner is professorial
PANCAKE: World War I vintage gas mask . It 's authentic . Strapped on , of course , so it ca n't fall off . The animal is free to be as active as he wants , does n't inhibit his movement , and I think it really sells the whole doughboy thing
DIRECTOR: It looks like a fucking joke .
PANCAKE: Nnnnrnff ! The director squints at him
DIRECTOR: What ?
PANCAKE: No , nothing , uh you 're absolutely ight , the gas mask is a whimsical concept
DIRECTOR: How the hell does it eat when it gets to the Kennel Rations ?
PANCAKE: Well , you 're absolutely right–-
DIRECTOR: Do n't let the client see this .
PANCAKE: Of course not , that would be inappropriate
DIRECTOR: Or the Humane fucker .
PANCAKE: No no
DIRECTOR: They 'll shut the fucking spot down , Pancake . Put the goddamn canteen ack on . That says he 's a soldier . Dented tin canteen . Just tie the damn thing to his collar . The dog flops over into the mud .
PANCAKE: Easiest thing in the world . I just thought but the canteen is much etter . Good concept . Let 's go with that
DIRECTOR: What 's he doing ? The dog has started to convulse .
PANCAKE: Well , he 's uh Just breathe normally , Otto .
DIRECTOR: The fucking dog ca n't breathe .
PANCAKE: Oh , he can breathe , that thing is just breathe normally , Otto . The dog 's breath is rasping and horrible .
DIRECTOR: The fucking dog can not breathe ! Get that fucking thing off him !
PANCAKE: Of course . Easiest thing in the world . He stoops and fiddles at the straps .
DIRECTOR: Get the fucking thing off him !
PANCAKE: Do n't have my Leatherman . Mountain ! Give me your Leatherman ! Chop chop !
DIRECTOR: Get the fucking thing off him ! Chitra , make sure the Humane fucker does n't come over here ! Bring him to craft services ! As he makes to scoop up the dog
PANCAKE: Good idea ! Ice water , treats-–
DIRECTOR: Not the dog , you idiot ! The Humane fucker ! Distract him !
PANCAKE: Right ! Of course ! He goes back to work on the mask .
DIRECTOR: Oh my god , he 's bleeding !
PANCAKE: No , that 's me I the Leatherman here we go .
DIRECTOR: Put up a couple solids here I do n't want the client seeing this ! Pancake thumps on the inert dog 's chest .
PANCAKE: Come on , Otto !
DIRECTOR: Otto is fucking dead !
PANCAKE: Mountain , have electric run me a stinger ! Do n't give up on me , Otto ! Mountain , I need two live leads ! More people crowd in to look .
MOUNTAIN GIRL: Clark , the gennie 's a hundred yards away !
PANCAKE: Goddamnit ! Otto 's gon na have brain damage in about ninety seconds ! Okay !
QUARTERBACK: Delta thirty-seven . On four ! All , with a simultaneous hand clap
TEAM: Huh !
QUARTERBACK: Okay , Epsilon twenty-two ! You the man ! Hey ! BUTTHEAD !
TEAM: Huh !
YOUTH #1: All right Dragon Lady , give us all the fuckin ' money ! The woman stares blankly .
VIETNAMESE WOMAN: Yao gin nyap !
YOUTH #2: Okay papa-san , we want that donut money .
YOUTH #1: And we ai n't fuckin ' around , Mr. Hi- Ho .
VIETNAMESE WOMAN: Hi-Ho .
YOUTH #2: Look , this fuckin ' thing , it ai n't complicated . You give us all the fuckin money , you do n't get shot in the head , you make more donuts , get more money . That 's how it works , see ?
YOUTH #1: Give us the money !
YOUTH #1: I think they 're in my brain , man
YOUTH #2: MOTHERFUCK !
PREACHER: I know you all remember that when Moses came down the mountain , carrying the word a God , come down that Sinai peak , he caught those Israelites red- handed . What he catch 'em doin ' ? He caught 'em worshipping a golden calf . Shouts of `` That 's right ! ''
WOMAN #1: You preach a wonderful sermon , Brothe Cleothus .
PREACHER: Why thank you , Sister Rose .
MRS. MUNSON: That man has a lot to say .
WOMAN #1: Yes he does .
MRS. MUNSON: And every word of it the truth .
WOMAN #2: Mm-mm . Jesus well pleased with him .
WOMAN #3: Deed he is .
PREACHER: Oh now ladies
WOMAN #3: Pleased as he can be .
WOMAN #1: Mm-mm .
MRS. MUNSON: Stout , too .
WOMAN #1: Mm-mm .
PREACHER: Oh now you gracious ladies .
MRS. MUNSON: It was a good sermon . That man has a lot to say .
DORR: My dear Mrs. Munson , I do so hope this is not an inopportune time fo our first practice
MRS. MUNSON: Somebody die ?
DORR: I beg your Oh !
MRS. MUNSON: No smoking in this house .
GENERAL: So sorry .
DORR: Clark Pancake a multi- instrumentalist , but with his emarkable embosser Clark specializes in wind instruments , and is especially accomplished on the French horn He nods , passes .
LUMP: Here 's your fiddle , Doctor . Mrs. Munson sizes up the group .
MRS. MUNSON: You ai n't gon na make a racket , are ya ?
DORR: Oh no . Oh no no no no no . No , we shall recuse ourselves to the basement where we shall be I think here the expression is uniquely appropriate He gives a sickly smile .
MRS. MUNSON: Hmph .
DORR: What do you think , General ? Present any problems ?
GAWAIN: Say wha ? Dorr 's smug smile fades . Testily
DORR: Where is the money ?
GAWAIN: Oh . End of every shift pit boss brings the cash down to the hold of the ship in the locked cash box ; once a day all the cash boxes 're moved to the counting room .
DORR: And where is the counting room ?
GAWAIN: Well , uh in that square there . Where you pointing .
DORR: And what , to flog a horse that if not at this point dead is in mortal danger of expirin ' , does the dotted square represent ?
GAWAIN: Offices . Underground .
DORR: Underground Mmm During the casino 's hours of operation the doo to the counting room is fiercely guarded , and the door itself is of edoubtable Pittsburgh steel ; when the casino is closed the entire underground complex is locked up and the armed guard retreats to the casino 's main entrance . There , then , far from the guard , reposes the money , cosseted behind a five-inch-thick steel portal , yes , but the walls , gentlemen , the walls of that room , are but humble masonry , behind which is only the soft loamy soil deposited over the centuries by Ol ' Man , the meanderin ' Mississip ' , as it fanned its way back and forth across this great alluvial plain
LUMP: What , uh what does `` cosseted '' mean ?
DORR: The General here , whose curriculum vitae compahends massive tunneling experience thoo the soil of his native French-Indochina , will direct ou little ol ' tunnelin ' operation . The General acknowledges with a curt nod .
PANCAKE: Happy to be on board .
DORR: Gawain is the proverbial `` inside man '' . He has managed to secure a erth on the custodial staff of the Lady Luck , thereby placin ' himself in a position to perform certain chores whose precise nature need n't detain us here , but whose performance shall guide this expedition to its happy conclusion .
GAWAIN: Ya damn skippy .
DORR: And this brings us to Lump . To look at Lump you might wonder , what function could he possibly fill , what specialized expertise could he possibly offer , to our merry little ol ' band a miscreants . Well gentlemen , in a project of such magnitude and such risks , it is traditional nay , it is imperative to enlist the services of a hooligan , a goon , an ape , a physical brute , who will e our security , our fist , ou atterin ' ram . Lump is our blunt instrument , and on all our behalfs I wish him a warm Mississippi welcome .
LUMP: Thanks , Professor .
DORR: Well gentlemen , here you are , men of different backgrounds and differing talents , men with , in fact only two things in common one , you all saw fit to answer my little advertisement in the Memphis Scimitar , and , two , you are all going to be , in consequence , very very incredibly ich . Let us revel in our adventure , gentlemen . Let us make beautiful music together . And above all , gentlemen , let us keep it to ourselves . What we say in this root cellar , let it stay in this root cellar .
LUMP: There 's no `` I '' in `` team '' . All stare at him .
DORR: Lump has a very excellent point .
MRS. MUNSON: That 's okay , do n't stop on account of me .
DORR: No no , madam , we were about to take a break anyway . The glissandi on this particular piece are technically very demanding and I think we would all welcome a moment of relaxation .
MRS. MUNSON: Huh . I just thought you might like to see-what a you gotten up to , honey ? Why you sweatin ' like that .
LUMP: I , uh
GAWAIN: That man plays one bitch barrelful a sackbutt . Ai n't no one can blow the tenor sackbutt like Lump , hoowee ! goes at that thing like it was a pu uh , like it was a woman ! Goddamn ! He She cuffs him on the head .
MRS. MUNSON: You mind ! I do n't want that kind of talk in my home , even in the root cellar . This is a Christian house , oy , none of that hippity-hop language .
DORR: Sadly , Gawain is given to WHAP ! She slaps Gawain again .
MRS. MUNSON: Sometimes it 's the only way !
DORR: As well you should , ma'am . But Gawain at times is so far transported by his love of the music of the early Renaissance as to
MRS. MUNSON: Do n't make no never-mind he 's transported !
DORR: I understand your She pulls her elbow away and sniffs .
MRS. MUNSON: You been smokin ' ?
DORR: Certainly not , madam . I understand your indignation . And I was offering explanation , not excuse . I myself am offended by those who can not find the proper words to express themselves and have recourse to Gawain calls up the stairs
GAWAIN: Do n't you be explainin ' me , dawg ! You ca n't look into my mind , cape man !
DORR: Yes , yes
MRS. MUNSON: My youth I was in church , I was n't walkin ' around fiery . Youth ai n't no excuse for nothin ' ! Well , anyway only came down to show you the fife .
DORR: Did he ?
MRS. MUNSON: Mm-hm . I thought maybe bein ' a musical man you 'd be interested .
DORR: Oh , I am indeed
MRS. MUNSON: Cut it himself and burned the holes . Israelites called it a kalil .
DORR: Ah .
MRS. MUNSON: Kalil , fife , same thing . You can ead about it in the Bible . Ai n't nothin ' new under the sun .
DORR: Indeed not .
MRS. MUNSON: Gone these twenty years . He was some kind of man .
DORR: I do n't suppose Othar ever turned his hand or , uh , heh-heh-heh , turned his lip to the shofar ? Prompted by her silence , he adds
MRS. MUNSON: I do n't know nothin ' 'bout that . Othar did n't study no shofar , to the extent a my knowledge . The kalil was good enough for my Othar She gazes at the portrait .
GAWAIN: Do n't let this uniform fool ya
GUDGE: I do n't care how big her ass was , MacSam . You 're fired .
GAWAIN: Say what ?
GUDGE: There is no fraternizing with customers on the Lady Luck . Clean out your locker .
GAWAIN: But Gudge–-
GUDGE: Get out of here . You 're fired .
GAWAIN: You ca n't fire me . I sue your ass !
GUDGE: Sue me ? For what ?
GAWAIN: Sue you for fuckin ' punitive damages , man !
GUDGE: Punitive damages .
GAWAIN: Ya damn skippy . I know you firin ' my ass 'cause I 'm black !
GUDGE: Everyone on the custodial staff is lack , MacSam . Your replacement 's gon na be black . His replacement will no doubt be black .
GAWAIN: Fuckin ' judge is gon na be black , motherfucker , that 's who gon na be lack ! You gon na stand tall before the man !
DORR: Oh my . Oh my my my my my . This is a severe setback . I am distraught . I am more than distraught , I am devastated . Oh my , this is quite the monkey-wrench heaved into the meticulously engineered construct of our little escapade .
LUMP: Yeah , it fucks things up .
DORR: I am beside myself . I am at a positive loss for words .
GAWAIN: You still talkin ' okay though .
WAITRESS: Have you all decided ?
DORR: Oh madam , we must have waffles . We must all have waffles forthwith ! They hand in their menus .
GAWAIN: Shit , man , it ai n't about apologizin ' ! He fired me 'cause I 'm black !
PANCAKE: He ca n't do that . You could sue him . Open and shut case .
GAWAIN: Fuckin ' A .
PANCAKE: This is not 1952 .
GAWAIN: Man 's a fuckin ' bigot .
DORR: Well then , perhaps , surely , a chocolate assortment has been known to warm the heart of even the most hardened misanthrope , especially if it 's a premium chocolate , imported , say , from Switzerland , or the Netherlands , or some other of the so- called `` Low '' countries be they Dutch or Flemish or Walloon
GAWAIN: Walloon my ass , the man ai n't gon na oll over for a fuckin ' candy bar !
PANCAKE: I 'm afraid there 's a setback on the tunneling front too . We 've run into a pretty large rock , and
GENERAL: Rock !
DORR: Oh my my , it seems that the poet was ight Troubles never singly come .
PANCAKE: Oh , we can get through the rock , no worries there . Simplest thing in the world . Why we blow right through it ; I 've got a pyro license , we bore a hole in the rock , pack in a little plastique ; igneous blows pretty good , and we
LUMP: Is he gon na want a piece of the action ? All turn to look at Lump .
PANCAKE: Who ?
LUMP: Igneous ? A female Voice
PANCAKE: Yes , Mountain , we were just talking about that , and some plastique . All the men are staring at her , agog .
GAWAIN: The fuck is this ?
PANCAKE: This is Mountain Girl . Mountain is my right hand . She helps me with ordnance . Helps me with damn nea everything . The men stare .
GAWAIN: You brought your bitch to the waffle house ? !
DORR: I confess myself to be puzzled as well . I thought we all understood that , so far as our little enterprise is concerned , mum , as the saying would have it , is the word
PANCAKE: Of course . I understand that . But this is Mountain He chuckles .
GAWAIN: You brought your bitch to the waffle house ? He looks around .
PANCAKE: Look , you , I 'll thank you to stop eferring to Mountain that way . She 's the other half of my life .
GAWAIN: Everybody lookin ' at me like I 'm a fuck-up , losin ' that sorry-ass job , and this motherfucker bring his bitch to the waffle house !
PANCAKE: You son of a bitch punk ! Shut you goddamn mouth !
GAWAIN: Come and get me motherfuck ! Come on , aby , let 's get it on ! Mountain starts screaming . People look , aghast .
DORR: Gentlemen , please ! The other men pry Pancake and Gawain apart .
PANCAKE: Nobody talks to Mountain Girl that way . She had an abusive family !
GAWAIN: Fuck you , man .
PANCAKE: Little punk . I got syrup on my safari jacket .
DORR: Gentlemen , I propose that we conside the matter of this woman , Mountain Water , to be
PANCAKE: Mountain Girl .
DORR: I am so very sorry . I propose that we consider this matter to be closed , and we shall chose to trust her , since we now have no choice , and since she shall share only in Mr. Pancake 's portion of the booty .
PANCAKE: Of course . Would n't have it any othe way .
GAWAIN: Damn right you wo n't .
PANCAKE: Up yours , punk .
DORR: Gentlemen ! And the manner of disposing of our igneous impediment is also settled . That leaves only the question of Gawain retrieving his job .
LUMP: Could n't you just bribe the guy ? All turn to look at Lump .
MRS. MUNSON: You just a readin ' fool , ai n't you Mr. Dorr .
DORR: Yes yes , I must confess , madam , that often I feel more at home in these ancient volumes than I do in the hustle-bustle of our modern world . To me , paradoxically , the literature of the so-called `` dead tongues '' has more currency than this mornin 's newspaper .
MRS. MUNSON: Mm-mm .
DORR: In these books
MRS. MUNSON: Wisdom of mankind , what about the wisdom of the Lord ?
DORR: Oh yes , the Good Book , mm . I have found reward in its pages . But fo me there are other good books as well ; the heavy volumes of Antiquity , freighted with the insights of Man 's glorious age . And then of course I love , love , love the works of Mr. Ed G'Allan Poe .
MRS. MUNSON: I know who he is . Kinda creepy .
DORR: Oh no , madam , noooo . Not of this world , true ; he lived in a dream , an ancient dream Dorr himself is lost in a dream
MRS. MUNSON: Who was Helen ? She was n't a loose woman , was she ? Some kinda whore a Babylon ? Dorr is still lost
DORR: One does n't know who Helen was , though I picture her as bein ' very , very extremely pale . He comes to himself , focuses on Mrs. Munson .
MRS. MUNSON: Oh Mr. Dorr , why you are such a gallant man
DORR: Oh no madam , I blush . I melt . No , I just happened to hear of this gospel concert tomorrow night , The Mighty Mighty Clouds of Joy , and I thought you and a friend from church , perhaps
MRS. MUNSON: Othar loved that music Yes , I got a widow-lady friend
DORR: The concert is up in Memphis , but I have arranged for a car service to transport you thither and , needless to say , back home at the concert 's termination . My friends and I will e rehearsing here tomorrow evening so you need n't worry about the security of your charming little old house There is a knock at the door .
MRS. MUNSON: Huh ? Excuse me .
SHERIFF: to let you know I had a word with WeeMack . He says he gon na comply with your request , keep the music down and neighborly .
MRS. MUNSON: Mm-hm . He calls from the bottom of the stoop
SHERIFF: So you have a pleasant evening now , and just let us know
MRS. MUNSON: Hang on there , Sheriff , somebody I want you to meet .
SHERIFF: Ma'am , I 'm a little pressed for time
MRS. MUNSON: Why , you chasin ' a gang of bank obbers ? Get on in here say hello .
SHERIFF: Someone was here , ma'am ?
MRS. MUNSON: Mm-hm , with me ' n Othar . Once again , he tries to excuse himself
SHERIFF: Well , maybe I 'll catch him next time
MRS. MUNSON: Come on up to his room .
SHERIFF: Very neat .
MRS. MUNSON: Probably went down to the cellar to play with his friends . She turns .
SHERIFF: Ma'am , I really have to
SHERIFF: be gettin ' back
MRS. MUNSON: What the
MRS. MUNSON: What the Why , Professor !
SHERIFF: Miz Munson , my pager just went off
MRS. MUNSON: Why of all the
SHERIFF: 'Fraid I got ta respond He opens the front door and calls up
DORR: Well that was very refreshing As you know
MRS. MUNSON: Why I never !
DORR: There was the goldfish-swallowin ' craze , of course , a different but elated phenomenon Ahem I hope I did n't spill any tea
GAWAIN: It 's just my way of sayin ' , well , goddamnit , I do n't know what it 's like walkin ' in your shoes , bein ' all tightass and all , and you do n't know what it 's like to walk in my shoes , but , well
GUDGE: Hmm
GAWAIN: But Jesus , if you 'd seen the ass on that girl , Mr. Gudge , you 'd a wanted her sitting on your face too .
GUDGE: Well , we 're all human .
GAWAIN: Ya damn skippy .
GUDGE: This apology buys you a one-week probationary period . Stay away from the customers , MacSam .
PANCAKE: The drill bit 's getting awfully hot . Gawain , maybe you could fill a hudson sprayer and spritz it down while I drill .
GAWAIN: Fuck you , man , I ai n't your house nigger . I 'm the inside man !
PANCAKE: Look , are you gon na have a bug up your ass for the rest of the time we work together ?
LUMP: I 'll get the sprayer .
PANCAKE: No no , me and this gentleman here have to get square . Let me tell you something , MacSam . You wan na know something ?
GAWAIN: I do n't wan na know shit from you .
PANCAKE: I 'm gon na tell you how I came down to Mississippi . Was n't born here , you know . I 'm from Scranton , Pennsylvania Abruptly , he stares off into space .
GAWAIN: Huh ? Pancake 's eyes regain their focus
PANCAKE: Scranton , Pennsylvania . Came down here in 1964 . Greyhound Bus . With the Freedom Riders . You know who the Freedom Riders were , MacSam ?
GAWAIN: I do n't give a shit who they were . Just tell me when they gon na leave .
PANCAKE: The Freedom Riders , my fine young man , were a group of concerned liberals from up North whites , Negros , and yes , Jewish people all working together , just like we are here . Concerned citizens who came down here so that local black people could have their civil liberties . So that people like you could have the vote .
GAWAIN: You know what , man ?
PANCAKE: What , brother ?
GAWAIN: I do n't vote . So fuck you . Pancake darkens
PANCAKE: Why you fucking
GAWAIN: And the bus you rode in on !
PANCAKE: That 's it ! He peels off his coat .
DORR: Yes , madam ?
MRS. MUNSON: My friend Mrs. Funthes is here so I 'm about to go on out . I just wanted to leave y'all with some cinnamon cookies
DORR: Oh madam , you are too kind . Our music , however , is how shall I put it ? ather Roman in its outlook ; many of our pieces were commissioned by the Holy See .
MRS. MUNSON: Oh , I see all right , but we do n't make a big whoop-dee-do about denominations ; everybody welcome at our church . We 've had Methodists come in . Episcopals . Even had a Jew come in once with a guitar back in the sixties .
DORR: Indeed . Excuse me , one moment , ma'am , and I shall see you off
GAWAIN: He 's the motherfuckin ' piece of igneous .
MRS. MUNSON: Professor , this is Rosalie Funthes , Rosalie , Professor G.H . Dorr , Ph.D .
ROSALIE: Oh my , that 's an awful lot of letters .
DORR: Well of course in my youth I was simply known as Goldthwait
PANCAKE: All right , safety meeting , let 's listen up . General , could you hand me the prima cord and the compound there . Before we set the charge we 'll un through our procedure .
DORR: I remember my father telling me and it is one of the few memories I etain of the man , from one of his visits home , and how I do cherish it he said , `` Goldthwait , you are not formed as other little boys . ''
ROSALIE: Mm-mm .
MRS. MUNSON: He a man of learnin ' ?
DORR: G.H . number two was self-educated ; he had no career , as such , though the state recognized the breadth of his readin ' by making him librarian at the state nervous hospital in Meridian , where he was a distinguished inmate .
PANCAKE: This is the same procedure we will e using when we collapse the tunnel after entering the casino vault and eturning to the root cellar . He looks pointedly at Gawain .
MRS. MUNSON: What in the name of heaven was that ? Dorr stares at the house , appalled .
DORR: I 'm quite sure that there is no cause for alarm He struggles for self-possession .
MRS. MUNSON: Did n't hear anything ? !
DORR: Well , something , perhaps , but Marva Munson starts to get out of the car .
LUMP: Blood , Professor ! Oh my God ! Blood !
PANCAKE: why , it 's nothing to make a fuss about . Perfectly all right happens all the time
GAWAIN: You got ta go find it , dipshit !
PANCAKE: No , no . Really , I 'm perfectly all ight .
GAWAIN: Perfectly all right ? You just blew your fucking finger off !
PANCAKE: Sure , but
GAWAIN: Well get back down there and find it , man ! I ai n't pickin ' up you goddamn finger !
DORR: I gather there was a premature detonation
GAWAIN: They can sew that shit back on , jack ! Like that guy his wife cut his dick off ! Just sewed that motherfucke ack on !
PANCAKE: Of course . Simplest thing in the world . Microsurgery
GAWAIN: Saw that motherfucker in a porno ! Thing still works !
PANCAKE: Oh yes , they have remarkable abilities in the , uh
MRS. MUNSON: They using the house to practice music a the rococo .
ROSALIE: Mmmm-hm .
DORR: I propose that we get our fallen comrade to the hospital , and the General shall follow when he manages to recover the severed digit .
PANCAKE: I do n't know what all the fuss is about . The cat jumps . The General leaps to follow .
MRS. MUNSON: PICKLES !
DORR: The house is perfectly in order , but we need medical attention for Mr. Pancake who , during the disturbance , pinched his finger in a valve of the sackbutt .
MRS. MUNSON: You let the cat out !
DORR: The General is even now exercising every effort to retrieve you mischievous little pet . Please go , go and enjoy your concert , and we shall see you later in the evening . Au revoir , mes dames !
PANCAKE: Just the usual spadework until we hit the masonry of the vault , and then we drill through .
DORR: And will you be able to wield the drill with your maimed extremity ?
PANCAKE: Oh , I should think so , it 's only one finger . Inhibits me in doing fine work , of course . I 'll always have to live with that Ahem . Maybe , and I 'm just thinking out loud here , maybe since , as you say , it will present problems later
DORR: Yes , Clark ?
PANCAKE: Well , maybe and this is something I 've talked over with Mountain Girl , and she agrees with me , so it 's not just one person 's opinion maybe I should get a little extra compensation for the accident . A long , stony silence .
GAWAIN: You gon na sue yaself for blowin ' off your finger ?
PANCAKE: Well that is simply asinine
DORR: Yes but you see , Clark , this is not what you just called `` some othe line of work . ''
PANCAKE: But if it were
DORR: This is a criminal enterprise , not to put too fine a point on it , entailin ' all manner a risks not involved in honest labor . Governmental egulations an ' civic safeguards can not be assumed to apply to antisocial pursuits .
LUMP: Yeah , but he lost his finger .
GAWAIN: We do n't give a shit ! Man can blow his own dick off , do n't make no nevermind to us ! We do n't got ta pay the man for goin ' around blowin ' off ody parts ! Getcha head outcha ass , man !
PANCAKE: Look , you
DORR: I think that in this instance Gawain has a very excellent point . I
GENERAL: No extra share ! All stop and stare at the General . Clark grumbles
PANCAKE: Well , okay , majority rules , like I say , it was just a trial balloon . Hand 's not so bad really , I even get some phantom feeling .
GAWAIN: You pull on your prick you get phantom feeling . Greedy motherfuck .
DORR: Now that that matter is settled , let us synchronize our watches before Gawain reports to work . In twenty seconds it will be twelve-sixteen exactly fifteen
PANCAKE: It will be twelve-fifteen ?
DORR: No , in fifteen seconds now eleven seconds it will be twelve- sixteen eight
LUMP: Professor ?
DORR: Six five yes , Lump ?
LUMP: I do n't have a watch .
GAWAIN: Me , dickwad .
GAWAIN: Well ai n't that somethin ' .
PANCAKE: Hnnnn . Arrunggggh ! Rnffff .
GAWAIN: Say what ?
PANCAKE: IBS ! Irritable Bowel Syndrome ! Is there a men 's room down here ? !
GAWAIN: Oh man , you should n't be using the men 's room
PANCAKE: Or a lady 's room ! IBS ! Quickly !
GAWAIN: You shoulda shit back in the house , man ! We do n't want Elron finding you in the goddamn crapper !
PANCAKE: No choice ! Quickly ! It 's a medical condition !
GAWAIN: You are disgusting , man . All right , follow me .
PANCAKE: Feel thirty pounds lighter . They start walking back to the vault .
GAWAIN: Oh fuck , man , I do n't wan na know about it .
PANCAKE: That 's the kind of attitude we 're fighting .
GAWAIN: Well maybe you should sign me up , man , 'cause you startin ' to irritate my bowel .
PANCAKE: I guess I never told you , that 's how Mountain Girl and I met . They had an IBS Weekend at Grossinger 's , in the Catskills . Of course the tourist business up there has suffered , with the demise of the Borscht Belt . So they have different promotions , mixers , so on . This was a weekend for Irritable Bowel singles to meet and support each other and share stories .
GAWAIN: Man , I do n't wan na hear a single one a them stories .
PANCAKE: Well , some of them are very
GAWAIN: Not one fuckin ' story ! You one fucked- up motherfucker ! You They stop short , looking
LUMP: Hey , lookit that .
PANCAKE: Huh . Looks like an Ikegami .
PANCAKE: Um-hm No He is fingering the back of the camera .
GAWAIN: Shut the fuck up !
PANCAKE: There 's no cure , you know . Only control . Lifelong condition . Not complaining , just fact . And I did meet Mountain .
GAWAIN: Grab your bag and get in that fucking hole !
DORR: Welcome back , gentlemen , mission accomplished I see . I am so very very delighted
LUMP: Maybe we could have something to drink , too .
GAWAIN: Motherfucker ca n't stop talking , ca n't stop shitting . Motherfucke tell everyone about his motherfuckin ' asshole . No one gives a shit about his asshole . Nobody interested in another man 's asshole . Or his bitch 's .
DORR: Gentlemen , to we few . We who have shared each other 's company , each other 's care , each other 's joy , and who now reap the fruits of ou communal effits , shoulder to shoulder , from each accordin ' to his abilities so forth whatnot . We have had ou little diffences along the way , it 's true , but I like to think they have only made us value one another the more , each coming to understand and appreciate the other 's unique qualities , potencies , and , yes , foibles . I suggest that we shall look back upon this caper one day , one distant day , grandchildren dandled upon our knee , and perhaps a tea will form , and we shall say , Well , with wit , and grit , and no small amount of courage , we accomplished something on that day , a feat of derring-do , an enterprise not ignoble we , merry band , unbound by the constraints of society and the prejudices of the common ruck , we happy few . Gentlemen to us !
MEN: To us ! They clink .
PANCAKE: Charge should 've gone off already .
DORR: I do beg your pardon ?
PANCAKE: The charge to collapse the tunnel . I set it for eight minutes . Dorr looks at his watch .
DORR: Well that time , and more , has most certainly elapsed .
PANCAKE: Of course . I understand .
DORR: The conundrum of the undisturbed yet empty vault , the unsolvable riddle of the sealed yet violated sanctum , is of the utmost importance not only to make our caper innelectually satisfying . It is also exigent as a matter of practical fact I remind you that if a tunnel is ever found leading to this house , this house 's owner knows all of your names .
PANCAKE: She certainly does .
DORR: Therefore to draw the unavoidable conclusion someone shall have to eenter the tunnel to reset that charge .
PANCAKE: Huh .
GAWAIN: You just fart ?
ELRON: Heh-heh-heh .
MRS. MUNSON: Professor , I 'm surprised .
DORR: Properly speaking , madam , we have een surprised ; you are taken aback . Though I acknowledge that the sense you intend is gaining currency through increasing use .
MRS. MUNSON: I hadda fix tea . I wan na talk to you , Professor , do n't you be leavin ' . And do n't make any more noise ! And you !
LUMP: She saw everything . She saw ou hole He turns to Dorr , near tears
DORR: Yes Yes
LUMP: What do we do ?
DORR: Well , first , my dear boy , we follow the General 's example
MRS. MUNSON: You get back down those stairs !
DORR: I assure you I shall be
MRS. MUNSON: Hush ! Down those stairs ! We havin ' tea now ! I be down shortly .
LADIES: Mm-hm .
DORR: She shall be down shortly
MRS. MUNSON: I do n't know what you boys been up to but I was n't born yesterday and I know mischief when I see it . Now I want an explanation , but first I want you boys to get your fannies up here with y'alls period instruments . I been tellin ' the ladies about you music and they wan na hear you play .
LUMP: Professor ?
DORR: Yes , Lump ?
LUMP: I ca n't really play the buttsack .
DORR: Madame or rather , mesdames you will have to accept our apologies for failing to perform since , as you see , we are shorthanded . Gawain is still at work and we could no more play with one part tacit than a horse could canter shy one leg .
LADIES: Mm-hmm .
MRS. MUNSON: Hmph .
DORR: Perhaps I could offer as a poor but eady substitute a brief poetic ecital . Though I do n't pretend to great oratorical skills , I will happily present , with your ladies ' permission , verse from the unquiet mind of Mr. Ed G'Allan Poe .
VOICE: Amen . A slurp of tea from another quarter . Dorr bears on
DORR: `` On desperate seas long wont to roam , Thy hyacinth hair , thy classic face , Thy Naiad airs have brought me home To the glory that was Greece And the grandeur that was Rome `` A long silence . Then , scattered
VOICES: Mm-mm . Glory hallelujah . A lady holding a teacup turns to the General
LADY: That was soooome poem . The General stares at her .
GAWAIN: Y'all been celebratin ' ? .
DORR: Goodbye , ladies . We had such a pleasant time .
MRS. MUNSON: Now , I wan na know what 's goin ' on .
DORR: Yes indeed , and the thirst fo knowledge is a very commendable thing . Though in this instance , I believe when you hear the explanation , you will laugh riotously , slappin ' you knee and perhaps even wipin ' away a giddy tear , relieved of your forme concern .
MRS. MUNSON: Hmph .
DORR: You see Lump here is an enthusiastic collector of Indian arrowheads and , having found one simply lying on your cellar floor , a particularly are artifact of the Natchez tribe , he enlisted us in an all-out effort to sift through the subsoil in search of others . Well , in doing so , we apparently hit a motherlode of natural gas I myself became acutely aware of the smell of `` rotten eggs '' and it was at just this unfortunate moment that the General here violated one of the cardinal rules of this house and lit himself a cigarette . The General stiffly bows
GENERAL: So sorry .
MRS. MUNSON: What about all that money ? Dorr 's smile fades .
DORR: Ah . The money . The money is Mr. Pancake 's .
PANCAKE: That 's right .
DORR: He only just re-mortgaged his house in order to pay for the procedure that will correct the wandering eye of his common-law wife , Mountain Water , who suffers from astygmia and strabismus and a general curdling of the vitreous jelly . Mr. Pancake however is an ardent foe of the federal reserve and is in fact one of those eccentrics about whom one occasionally reads , hoarding his entire life savings either under the proverbial mattress or , as in Mr. Pancake 's case , in a Hefty bag that is his constant companion . Under her stare , he elaborates
PANCAKE: Do n't trust the banks . Never have . She thinks , decides .
MRS. MUNSON: This do n't smell right . I 'm callin ' Sheriff Wyner . A chorus of gasps .
DORR: Madam if you please . Yes ! Yes ! It was a lie ! A fantastic tale ! You have us ! Dead to rights ! But please allow me to tell you the truth in private .
MRS. MUNSON: Mm-hm .
DORR: We are not in fact musicians of the late Renaissance . Nor of the early or mid period . We are , in fact criminals ! Desperate men , madam ! We have tunneled into the nearby offices of the Lady Luck gambling emporium and have relieved it of its treasure !
MRS. MUNSON: Lord have mercy !
DORR: It is true that the Lady Luck is a den of iniquity , a painted harlot luring people into sin and exciting the vice of greed with her false promise of easy winnings . Oh , he gains are ill-gotten , yes , but I offer no excuses save one ! We men have each pledged half of our share of the booty to a charitable institution the General , to a placement service for Southeast Asian efugees ; Mr. Pancake to the Blue Ridge Parkway Conservancy ; and Lump to the United Jewish Appeal . As compensation for use of your house we had planned to donate a full share to Bob Jones University , without urdening you with guilty knowledge y informing you of same . But you have wrested the information from me ! Now it is all on the table . Now you have it , the whole story , the awful truth .
MRS. MUNSON: Stolen money !
DORR: Yes , yes , shamefully I admit it , yes ! But find the victim , Mrs. Munson , I challenge you ! Even the casino itself , that riparian Gomorra , shall suffer no harm ! It has an insurance company , a financial behemoth that will cheerfully replenish its depleted vaults ! That is its function ! And the insurance company itself is made up of tens and tens of thousands of policy-holders so that we have done the calculations , Mrs. Munson ! so that at the end of the day , at the final reckoning , each policy- holder shall have contributed only one penny one single solitary cent to the satisfaction of this claim .
MRS. MUNSON: Just one penny ?
DORR: Think of it , Mrs. Munson ! One cent from thousands upon thousands of people so that Bob Jones University can continue on its mission ! Why , I have no doubt that , were the policy- holders aware of the existence of that august institution , why , each and every one of them would have volunteered some token amount to the furtherance of its aims !
MRS. MUNSON: Well that 's prob'ly true
DORR: Yes madam , sadly , the criminal stain is upon my soul , but the benefit shall accrue to any number of worthy causes . As long , that is , as the secret stays with us . And I , surely , shall not be the one to divulge it . Mrs. Munson nods , musing .
MRS. MUNSON: Well it 's hard to see the harm in it One penny
DORR: Excuse me , ma'am ?
MRS. MUNSON: No . It 's wrong . Do n't you be leadin ' me into temptation .
DORR: Madam , I must strenuously protest
MRS. MUNSON: No , it 's just plain wrong . Stealin ' . I know your intentions were good , and I wo n't call the police if you give the money back . But I got ta see that you do it .
DORR: Madam
MRS. MUNSON: And all a you got ta go to church with me next Sunday . The Professor is incredulous
DORR: And engage in divine worship ?
MRS. MUNSON: I made up my mind . You can double- talk all you want , but its church o the county jail .
DORR: But She rises .
MRS. MUNSON: You think it over . I got ta feed the cat .
GAWAIN: Motherfuck !
DORR: Yes . Unfortunately , Mrs. Munson has ather complicated the situation
GAWAIN: I know how to discomplicate it ! Put a cap in the old lady 's head ! Then everything simple again !
DORR: Not easy to do . Many reasons . Practical ones a quiet neighborhood , a sleepy town . Reasons of moral epugnance a harmless woman , a deed conceived and executed in cold blood . No , Gawain ; would that it were simple !
GAWAIN: Well fuck , man ! What we gon na do , give the money back and go to church ? !
DORR: I shudder . I quake . He turns to the General .
GENERAL: Must float like a leaf on the rive of life . And kill old lady . The men murmur .
DORR: Well I suppose you are right . It is the active nature of the crime , though , that so horrifies the squeezing of the trigger , the plunging of the knife . But , think a moment look at the other tools we have at hand . He looks around .
PANCAKE: Sure , easiest thing in the world . I could whip up a little mortar in one of those snow saucers , lay the bricks , anchor in some chains , Mountain has a source for the manacles
DORR: Ahh but gentlemen , we delude ourselves . Think of the woman 's piteous moans as we lay tier upon tier of brick . Think of he lamentations as we fit the last brick into place , appealing to our bette selves , the higher angels of ou nature , our recollections of our own sainted mothers No , I fear that we lack the sand to commit such an act . No no shortest and most painless is best . Let us confront eality . Gawain 's gun the retort muffled by a pillow into the ain the affair of an instant . The only question is who wields the weapon .
PANCAKE: Well , sure , fair enough .
GAWAIN: You one whiney motherfucker ! I squeeze your nutsack you keep that up !
PANCAKE: Listen , punk
DORR: Gentlemen , no special pleading , no exceptions . It 's in the nature of the situation that we would all prefe to be excused .
PANCAKE: Well , okay it was just a trial alloon
GAWAIN: Motherfucker He touches the other straw , hesitates .
MAMA: What you got there , Gawain ?
CHILD GAWAIN: Why nothin ' , mama .
MAMA: Nothin ' my ass ! You got a dog there !
CHILD GAWAIN: No , Mama !
MAMA: A filthy noisy little pest of a puppy dog gon na shit all over the house !
CHILD GAWAIN: He wo n't shit in the house , Mama , I 'm gon na train him , I promise , gon na train him real good WHAP ! She cuffs him on the side of his head .
MAMA: I 'm gon na train you real good ! I told you do n't bring no stray dogs into this house ! WHAP ! Another slap .
CHILD GAWAIN: Please do n't hurt me no more ! I love you , Mama !
MAMA: Daddy gon na kick your ass !
SISTER: Mama 's whuppin ' Gawain 's ass !
BROTHER: Ai n't you gon na use the strap , Mama ? WHAP ! WHAP ! Gawain is sobbing
CHILD GAWAIN: Please do n't hurt me , Mama ! Now it is the adult Gawain blubbering .
MRS. MUNSON: What you doin ' ? What you doin ' with my pillow there ?
GAWAIN: I 'm sorry , ma'am , I WHAP ! She cuffs him on the side of the head .
MRS. MUNSON: I 'm displeased with you ! Colored boy like you , falling in with that trash downstairs !
GAWAIN: I ca n't do it ! The men are stunned .
DORR: Why this is most irregular .
GAWAIN: She reminds me of my mama . I ca n't shoot my mama ! You motherfuckers just draw straws again .
PANCAKE: Wait a minute . You 've got to accept your responsibilities , young man .
GAWAIN: Fuck you . And your irritated bowel . I ca n't shoot that old lady .
GENERAL: Must shoot !
PANCAKE: Now look here , it 's the easiest thing in the world . Pretend her head is a casaba melon , and the gun is a melon- aller , and
GAWAIN: What the fuck you talkin ' about , man ? You think this a melon-baller , you do it , man !
DORR: My my , this is most irregular .
PANCAKE: Look , with equal rights come equal esponsibilities
DORR: I 'm afraid that Mr. Pancake is right , my dear fellow . We can not draw straws again ; the exercise loses all credibility if you show that the loser can simply beg off doing the job .
GENERAL: Must shoot ! Gawain shoves the gun toward Pancake .
GAWAIN: She just an old colored lady to you you do it , man !
PANCAKE: Why you sniveling little coward !
GAWAIN: What you say , you whiney motherfucker ? I come up your irritated ass with this motherfuckin ' gun He is waving the gun .
PANCAKE: You think you scare me , you mewling punk ! You do n't scare me ! Bull Conno and all his dogs did n't scare me ! He shoves Gawain .
GAWAIN: You fuck ! He shoves him back . Pancake shoves
PANCAKE: Be a man !
GAWAIN: You ai n't no fuckin ' man , fuckin ' a sixty-year-old lady in pigtails !
DORR: Gentlemen , please !
GAWAIN: I seen Virginia hams I 'd rather stick my dick in than your old BANG ! A muffled gunshot . Quiet . The two men have stopped rolling .
PANCAKE: Oh my god Horrified , he slowly rises .
LUMP: Oh , fuck .
DORR: Oh my .
LUMP: Is he dead , Professor ?
PANCAKE: Sure he 's dead . I checked his carotid artery .
DORR: Well this is most irregular . We will need a Hefty bag .
MRS. MUNSON: Mm-hmm .
DORR: There was much spirited discussion and an atmosphere of frank give-and- take . Some of our number were initially appalled at your proposal that we simply return the money ; some were more receptive .
MRS. MUNSON: I do n't care they was receptive o not !
DORR: And that attitude , madam , was a facto in our discussions . To a man , I must say , they were devastated at the prospect of not being able to contribute to their respective charities .
MRS. MUNSON: Well that is a shame .
DORR: Indeed . But at the end of the day , your position prevailed , and the men have decided that we shall return the money every last cent of it ! and attend Sunday services , rathe than spend the remainder of our years wasting away in the Mississippi Men 's Correctional Facility . Though that was the original preference of some .
MRS. MUNSON: Well I 'm glad y'all came to see the light , anyway . I 'm gon na have some tea and go to bed .
DORR: So the money shall be returned tomorrow at the opening of the casino office . Enjoy your tea , madam Backing out , he looks to one side .
PANCAKE: They back yet ? Dorr is absent
DORR: Yes yes , they just arrived . Pancake straightens from the satchel .
PANCAKE: Good . I 'll go dump these in the hearse .
DORR: What in heaven 's name
PANCAKE: Mountain .
MOUNTAIN GIRL: Clark .
PANCAKE: Nnrungh ! Aaarmh Ninnnff Offffflleghhll
MOUNTAIN GIRL: IBS , dear ?
PANCAKE: Nnnnnmmmmfffgh !
DORR: `` Like those Nicean barks of yore That gently , o'er a perfumed sea ''
LUMP: Quick ! Grab Clark !
DORR: `` The weary , wayworn wandere ore `` They drop the second body .
DORR: T'was our até brought us to this pass
LUMP: What , Professor ?
DORR: Our overweening pride The old woman is a more potent antagonist than one had imagined
LUMP: Professor , I been doing some thinking .
DORR: Oh dear . Oh dear oh dear oh dear .
LUMP: Maybe she 's right ! Maybe we should e going to church !
DORR: Oh dear , Lump . I feared that those would be your words . Not that I do n't appreciate your giving the matte the benefit of your thought . But please recall , young man , ou espective functions in this enterprise . I am a professor , the professor as you yourself so often say , the thinker , the `` brains of the operation , '' trained in fact in the arts of cogitation . You , Lump , are the goon , the hooligan , the dum ute whose actions must be directed y a higher intelligence .
LUMP: Yeah , I know , but
DORR: No buts , dear boy ! Do not repeat the error of thinking ! Now is the moment of praxis ! Now , my dear boy , you must act !
LUMP: I ca n't do it , Professor ! A nice old lady like that !
DORR: Think of the riches , Lump , that you and I alone shall divide ! Recall the dream of wealth untold that first drew you to this enterprise !
LUMP: But
DORR: And reflect also that if you decline to act , forcing me to do so , then you shall no longer have any entitlement to the money ! Your offices shall have been nugatory !
LUMP: You mean you mean you 're gon na kill her ? !
DORR: Of course ! My hand would be forced !
LUMP: I ca n't let you do that , Professor ! A nice old lady like that !
DORR: You ? ! Allow ? Not allow ? What presumption ! You stupid boy ! You very very extremely stupid boy !
LUMP: Oh yeah ? He points the gun at the Professor and
DORR: Perhaps it had to be thus . He goes to the railing to look down .
DORR: Ah , Psyche ! from the regions which Are Holy land ! ''
MRS. MUNSON: Mm-hm .
SHERIFF WYNER: Miz Munson .
MRS. MUNSON: Sheriff , I got ta make a statement .
SHERIFF WYNER: Could it possibly wait , ma'am ? We 're a little busy today .
MRS. MUNSON: I guess it can wait , but it 's about that casino money .
SHERIFF WYNER: Call you right back .
MRS. MUNSON: Something ? Everything ! I got it at home .
SHERIFF WYNER: You you have what at home , now ?
MRS. MUNSON: The money . Two point six million dollars . Down in my root cellar . All stacked up nice and neat .
SHERIFF WYNER: Mm-hmm . The deputy pauses to look up from his phone
DEPUTY: How 'd it get there , Marva ?
MRS. MUNSON: Bunch a desperate men that stole it put it there , that 's how ! They was musicians of the Renaissance period , played the sackbutt and so on well , it turns out they really could n't play , although they could ecite poems to break your heart . Their ringleader speaks in dead tongues .
SHERIFF WYNER: Does he now .
MRS. MUNSON: I tried to get you to see him ! That night ?
SHERIFF WYNER: Oh yes .
MRS. MUNSON: I had to yell at 'em 'bout stealin ' all that money and I guess I made 'em feel pretty bad 'cause they picked up and left without takin ' the money . But I was peeved with 'em , Sheriff , they 'd been up to all sorts of mischief , come close to blowin ' up the house , disturbed Othar no end .
SHERIFF WYNER: Angry , was he ?
MRS. MUNSON: Would n't you be ? All that racket !
SHERIFF WYNER: I expect so .
MRS. MUNSON: And they let Pickles out too ! The sheriff sighs .
SHERIFF WYNER: So you want us to go fetch him .
MRS. MUNSON: No , he 's back , but what you want me to do with the money ?
SHERIFF WYNER: Well
MRS. MUNSON: Keep it ?
DEPUTY: You keep it , Marva .
MRS. MUNSON: Well I know it 's only a penny offa everybody 's policy
SHERIFF WYNER: How 's that ma'am ?
MRS. MUNSON: I know folks do n't much care . Could I You s'pose I could
SHERIFF WYNER: Yes ma'am ?
MRS. MUNSON: Could I give it all to Bob Jones University ?
SHERIFF WYNER: That 'd be nice , ma'am .
MRS. MUNSON: Well , long as everybody knows .
SHERIFF WYNER: Thank you for the information , ma'am .
MRS. MUNSON: You 're welcome , sheriff . Just doin ' my duty .

JACK: What did this ? OFF Keough , we
KEVIN: Hey .
KELLY: Kevin . How 's it going , what 's happenin ' , family good , great , nice to catch up , get out .
KEVIN: This is business . There was an accident in Maine , some guy got killed by something in a lake . Probably a bear , but they found a tooth .
KELLY: A tooth ?
KEVIN: A tooth they say could n't have come from any bear . They say it looks prehistoric . Like maybe a dinosaur .
KELLY: Oh , well then I 'm sure that 's it , he got killed by a dinosaur , anything else ?
KEVIN: I want you to go there . Now she looks up .
KELLY: Sorry ?
KEVIN: I 'm sure it 's nothing , but you 're a paleontologist , this is what we do , I
KELLY: This is what we do ?
KEVIN: I 'd like you to check out this lake . See
KELLY: Are you on drugs ?
KEVIN: Kelly
KELLY: I 'm not going to Maine , I wo n't even go west of Forty-third Street
KEVIN: Part of our research
KELLY: I 'm not even a field person .
KEVIN: Well on this one I 'd like you to e. Kelly stares back . The nickle drops .
KELLY: This was Myra 's idea , was n't it ? Get me out of the office for a few days , until
KEVIN: It has nothing to do with
KELLY: I never do field work and even if I did , Maine , to look at a tooth of a dinosaur who bit somebody , could n't you dream up something
KEVIN: Kelly
KELLY: I am not going to Maine . That 's idiculous .
KEOUGH: He just came up screaming .
KELLY: Did he say anything ?
KEOUGH: He just kinda gurgled . He was pretty much dead .
KELLY: And you did n't see anything ?
KEOUGH: The lake was dead calm until up he came . The tooth is in there .
KELLY: There ? That 's the morgue .
KEOUGH: Yes .
KELLY: Is the dead guy in there ?
KEOUGH: That 's where they keep them . You want me to bring the tooth out here ?
KELLY: Um . No , no . Let 's go .
DANIELS: Fine . There you go .
KELLY: Maybe I should see
KEOUGH: I would n't .
KELLY: I 'm fine , thank you .
KEOUGH: Have you ever seen a dead body efore , Ms. Scott ?
KELLY: Well . At wakes .
KEOUGH: This is a little different .
KELLY: I can look at dead things . And Daniels is about to pull the sheet back
KEOUGH: Seconds . Three , four .
KELLY: And this is how he came to the oat ?
KEOUGH: Yes .
KELLY: Okay . And is there a place nearby I could go to vomit ? OFF this , we
KEOUGH: Nobody lives within twenty-five miles , 'cept some old couple who live right on the lake . Teenagers trek in every once in a while , none have disappeared , and none have spotted anything unusual .
KELLY: You talk to the married couple ?
KEOUGH: Not yet .
KELLY: What kind of backup do we have ?
KEOUGH: We ? That strikes a nerve .
KELLY: What ?
KEOUGH: Sorry . I 'm just a little unclea as to why the Museum of Natural History would send somebody here .
KELLY: You have a thing against museums ?
KEOUGH: I got nothing against
KELLY: Ever even been in one ?
KEOUGH: Lightweight Forward Area air device unit . Whatever 's out there , one shot with this and he 's dead .
KELLY: And you stock these things fo what , to fend off Russia ? A beat .
KEOUGH: You 're sort of a rude person .
KELLY: It 's just that
JACK: We set ?
KEOUGH: Ready . A museum in New York sent us some additional back up . Kelly shoots Keough a look . Then
KELLY: Kelly Scott .
JACK: Jack Wells . A museum sent you ?
KELLY: Are we all museum bigots in Maine ? Jack holds a look , decides to let that pass .
JACK: Did you make anything of the tooth ?
KELLY: Yes , it did seem prehistoric but I 'm sure he just carried the thing for luck . Not that it worked , obviously . It probably somehow got lodged into his body . Jack holds another look .
KEOUGH: I 'm ready when you are .
JACK: Let 's go .
KELLY: Excuse me . One other thing , it 's a small point , but I have a thing about being humored , and I 'm feeling humored , more by him , but you seemed quick to join in .
JACK: Ma'am , your first impression is n't going well .
JANINE: Excuse me ? Is it true you 're going to look for some kind of monster in Black Lake ?
KEOUGH: We 're just going to investigate an accident . There 's no monster .
JANINE: We heard a man got bit in half .
KEOUGH: There was an accident , that 's all . Nothing to worry about .
KELLY: Please .
BICKERMAN: Oh , my husband passed away almost two years ago .
KEOUGH: My department does n't have any ecord of that , Mrs. Bickerman .
BICKERMAN: Oh well , I 'm sorry . I did n't ealize you keep such a firm track of the dead .
KELLY: What was the cause of you husband 's death , Ma'am , do you know ? Off Bickerman 's silence
KEOUGH: Was he swallowed ?
KELLY: Sheriff .
JACK: Mrs. Bickerman , the reason we 're up here a man was fatally attacked yesterday by some animal in this lake . Do you know how you husband died ?
BICKERMAN: Oh yes . I killed him .
JACK: You killed him .
BICKERMAN: Oh , yes .
KEOUGH: And how would you have accomplished this , Ma'am ?
BICKERMAN: Well , he was very ill and he efused to go see a doctor and well I think he had Alzheimer 's , he would be coherent one day , incoherent the next and one coherent day , he asked me to end his suffering . I would n't do it ut he kept insisting and insisting and deteriorating till the point the only cognitive thing he could eally do was that I finish him off . Finally I just gave in and hit him on the head with a skillet then buried him under the bulkhead .
KEOUGH: Half mile up , there 's a clearing .
JACK: You gon na dig up that lady 's husband ?
KEOUGH: I 'll call the coroner .
KELLY: What is with this lake ? It looks lack and there are no waves o anything .
KEOUGH: They wanted to call it Lake Placid . But somebody said that name was taken .
KELLY: Gee . Jack smiles , gets her sarcasm .
KEOUGH: The tents were sent ahead , they should already be set-up .
KELLY: We 're staying in tents ?
KEOUGH: I told you . Two days , we 'd have to camp .
KELLY: Yes , camp , I thought that meant Holiday Inn , I never heard `` tents '' , will there be toilets ?
KEOUGH: What the hell ?
KELLY: What ?
KEOUGH: I thought I saw
KELLY: It looks like a branch .
KEOUGH: Hey ! !
KELLY: You threw it at me ! !
KEOUGH: I just let go of it .
KELLY: Do n't throw heads at me , and stop calling me `` Ma'am '' !
JACK: What is going on here ?
KELLY: How big do the bears get ?
JACK: Big but a bear could n't do that to a moose or man in water . On land maybe . But
KELLY: And they 're sure he did n't get tangled under the outboard somehow ?
JACK: Hank says he 's sure . Kelly takes in the scenic surroundings .
KELLY: It really is beautiful , is n't it ?
JACK: Never been to Maine before ?
KELLY: I was told they discriminate against people with hygiene . I never believed it . He measure her . Then
JACK: Why are you here ? Really .
KELLY: I told you .
JACK: The Museum of Natural History does n't send out investigators to
KELLY: How would you know , what
JACK: And even if they did , I doubt he o she would have problems with tents .
KELLY: So I do n't like tents , why
JACK: You do n't like tents , mosquitos , look at your fingernails , you have about as much business being in the woods
KELLY: I am a paleontologist . I also was dating my boss he turned out to be involved with a co-worke who was also my friend and for the sake of comfort , theirs , I was shipped off to Maine . I do n't feel like going back yet . There . She said it . He stares back .
JACK: Well . You do n't have to stay out here , why do n't
KELLY: I 've come , I 'm here , I 'm staying . Unless there are ticks .
JACK: What ?
KELLY: If this is who I think it is . It is .
JACK: Who ?
KELLY: Hector Cyr . He 's a rich kook mythology professor . He 's done some work with our museum . He also treks the world to swim with crocodiles .
KEOUGH: With what ?
KELLY: Crocodiles . He 's an expert on them . And if he 's here then he must think that 's what 's in this lake .
JACK: In Maine ?
KELLY: There have been Northern sightings . But not this North .
HECTOR: You beat me . Balls . I need some of you to help me unpack . You and you . Not you . Who do we have from Fish And Game ?
KEOUGH: Who is he ?
HECTOR: I 'll need any and all topographic studies .
KEOUGH: Wait just a second . You do n't just fly in here and start barking orders .
HECTOR: I apologize , I just do n't want to lose the light , we 've got time fo a quick scout , you 've had work done .
KEOUGH: Mr. Cyr !
HECTOR: C'mon , we 're losing light , why does the big one heckle me ? Kelly yanks him aside .
KELLY: Hector . The big one has no sense of humor . And since he 's the one who decides whether you get to play , try not to be your obnoxious self .
HECTOR: That hurt my feelings .
JACK: If we 're gon na go we better go .
HECTOR: If he 's here , I 'll find him . Did she tell you we had sex together ?
KELLY: I never had sex with you !
HECTOR: Even so , you 're allowed to boast . You look thin by the way , I 've mentally undressed you , I can see your ribcage .
KEOUGH: I really do n't mean to be discourteous . But how is it a person could come to believe that a crocodile is in New England ?
HECTOR: They have saltwater glands , they can swim across oceans , it 's only a matter of time .
KEOUGH: And what would he do come winter ?
HECTOR: They can survive winter . As long as their nostrils do n't freeze , they survive , am I foolish to explain things , he had such trouble with my name ?
KEOUGH: Around here . Yeah .
HECTOR: If he 's eaten in the area , he should n't be far away . Crocs hang around the food source .
KELLY: But they 're nighttime hunters , Hector , he 'd probably be on land now anyway .
HECTOR: 'Cept he was n't before , was he ? You know , when friends or family members say things , they tend not to register so sometimes it helps to hear it from a total stranger . You 're fat .
KELLY: Hector .
JACK: What 's that ?
KEOUGH: White perch .
JACK: Are they feeding ?
KEOUGH: Does n't look like it .
JACK: They look like they 're jumping .
KELLY: They look scared .
HECTOR: What 's going on ?
KEOUGH: They do n't believe her .
KELLY: Thank you , it 's so rewarding to imagine my tax dollar finding its way to you , you Fucker .
HECTOR: Such the flirt .
KELLY: U.S. Wildlife wo n't send anybody without a confirmation .
JACK: Same thing from Fish And Game .
KELLY: Something 's in that water .
JACK: Well until we see it , we 're not gon na be convincing too many people . As DEPUTY SHARON GARE approaches
GARE: You might want to see this . They all walk over .
GARE: It 's a human toe . Hector studies it , picks it up . Then
HECTOR: Some decomposition , little acidic , it has been swallowed . Is this the man who was killed ? Keough deadpans back . Then
KEOUGH: We 'd only just met .
HECTOR: Well , you 've got a croc alright , they 're keystone species .
KEOUGH: Keystone what ?
HECTOR: Species , keystones affect the entire ecosystem , that could explain all these worms , the water . You 've got a crocodile . Bury your friend .
JACK: Baby crocs ?
KELLY: Adult males will charge hatchlings . If there 's one out there
JACK: If one could be out there why does Fish And Game tell me it 's impossible ?
KELLY: Because they just consult thei little indigenous charts . A beat , as she tends to her work .
JACK: Listen if you really do know crocs , you should know how stealth like they are . I would n't be standing a foot from the water . She looks .
KELLY: I 'd be able to see something .
BURKE: He paid us . Five hundred . Keough continues on toward the tent .
HECTOR: You 're a beautiful woman .
GARE: Thank you .
HECTOR: And law enforcement , such dangerous work . The idea that you could die suddenly with no offspring , disconcerting , let 's mate , commit your genes to perpetuity .
KEOUGH: Hey . He goes , turns OFF the MUSIC .
HECTOR: Cocktail ?
KEOUGH: No ! ! What 's with digging the holes ?
HECTOR: They come on land and they 're azen . They 're also attracted to noise , you can see I make a lot of it .
KEOUGH: Everybody out , back to your tents , now ! They start to leave .
HECTOR: Could she stay , we 've tentatively scheduled intercourse .
KEOUGH: No ! ! Out !
HECTOR: And you like me .
KEOUGH: I do not like you .
HECTOR: Deep down , gut check . I 'm growing fond of you and it 's liberating to say so . Keough stares back .
KEOUGH: You 're a whacko . And Keough leaves , to
JACK: What are you doing ?
KELLY: Skipping stones . Look how flat that water is , you can get ten skips on a good one . A beat .
JACK: Listen , uh Hank and I think it est if you stay on shore .
KELLY: I beg your pardon ?
JACK: Whatever 's out there did flip ove a canoe
KELLY: I am not staying on shore .
JACK: It 's too dangerous for
KELLY: I did n't fly up here to roast marshmallows
JACK: You flew up here because your boss
KELLY: I am going out on that boat and why are you picking on me , is this some kind of
JACK: I 'm sorry but you 're A beat . He does n't finish the sentence .
KELLY: I do know crocodiles and I wo n't get in your way . I really do want to be a part of this . Jack reads her , he can see that she does .
JACK: Okay . We 're up at six .
KELLY: Good .
JACK: 'Night .
KEOUGH: What the hell are you doing ? ! !
HECTOR: What are you doing ? !
KEOUGH: You 're crawling around like a
HECTOR: I 'm laying a spring trap !
KEOUGH: A spring trap !
HECTOR: I keep telling you , they can come on land , I do n't wan na wake up in the middle of the night
KEOUGH: I coulda shot you , you
HECTOR: This could end up saving your life ,
KELLY: Hey ! What is going on ?
KEOUGH: Apologize ?
JACK: He thinks they 're what ?
KELLY: In his defense , every primitive culture known to man deified them . He 's a mythology professor , he thinks crocs are divine conduits .
KEOUGH: Is this 'spose to make me take him more serious ?
KELLY: It 's to make you understand him , with understanding comes tolerance . Too bad they do n't put proverbs in Twinkies , my load would be lighter .
KEOUGH: Why does everybody insult my intelligence , I have intelligence , intelligent people eat Twinkies .
KELLY: I 'm sorry . Keough shoots a look to Jack .
JACK: Let 's just all get some sleep . And Keough heads off , under
KEOUGH: I 'm an intelligent person .
HECTOR: They do n't really attack underwate and
KEOUGH: That `` Walt '' guy got hit underwater
HECTOR: No crocodile has ever
KELLY: You should take a flax pole .
HECTOR: And what if I tranq him Kelly ? He drowns . You think about that ?
KELLY: I 'm just saying last resort .
KEOUGH: Again . Not to be disruptive . Do we have a problem with it dying ?
HECTOR: Crocodiles do n't sever with thei teeth , their molars are blunt .
KEOUGH: Is this a trick ?
HECTOR: What I 'm saying is if it 's a crocodile that cut a man in half he would have to be over twenty feet which would make him well over a hundred years old , it would be unthinkable to destroy him .
JACK: Alright , let 's just drop here .
KELLY: They respond pretty quick . I 'll wait till you get down before I turn it on .
JACK: Good . See ya soon .
KELLY: Good luck .
HECTOR: Two years married , divorced , used to be a lawyer , quit , I 'm still waiting on his sperm count .
KELLY: What ? Oh as if I 'm interested .
HECTOR: As if . Will you miss me ?
KEOUGH: I brought a pork chop , maybe we could hang it around your neck fo luck .
HECTOR: No thank you , but maybe later you can chew the bark off my big fat log . And Hector drops overboard .
KEOUGH: Was that like a homo-sexual remark ?
KELLY: I asked you to be nice to him . Keough rolls his eyes .
KEOUGH: And that 's why he thinks they 're Godly ?
KELLY: He said he knew it when he looked into their eyes .
KEOUGH: You like Jack ?
KELLY: What ? I do n't even know the guy .
KEOUGH: Hector thinks you like him .
KELLY: Well Hector 's a giant cracker .
KEOUGH: You think Jack 's handsome ?
KELLY: What is this ?
KEOUGH: I 'm just curious . I can never tell what women think is handsome . Is he handsome ?
KELLY: Well . He 's probably rugged handsome I guess . Yeah . A beat .
KEOUGH: Am I ?
KELLY: It should n't be taking so long . They both scan the surface . Dead calm .
KEOUGH: Hector , Jack , we show you with about twelve minutes of oxygen left , and you 're on the last tank . Time to go home .
KELLY: That was a bust .
KEOUGH: I do n't know . It was like a tug . Something tugged us .
BURKE: Something 's got the anchor line !
KEOUGH: Kelly ! !
KEOUGH: Jack ! ! Hector ! We 're being dragged ! ! Cut the line ! Cut the fucking line !
BURKE: I 'm trying !
KELLY: Hurry up ! !
BURKE: Look out ! !
KEOUGH: Are you alright ?
KELLY: I think . My hair . Where 's Hector ? ! Where is he ?
JACK: We went in different directions . That water is thick , you ca n't see through it !
KEOUGH: Hector ! Hector , we got dragged off position , when you surface , you got ta yell .
KELLY: There 's bubbles over there ! Look !
KEOUGH: Nobody actually saw it . It happened sudden .
JACK: You okay ? Kelly ?
KELLY: Yeah . Nobody saw anything ?
JACK: No . U.S. Wildlife is on their way .
KELLY: That 's probably good .
JACK: Police want to keep it quiet , if the press gets word lake monster . They just want us to sit tight .
JACK: Are you okay ?
KELLY: Um y'know Yeah .
JACK: A man died . You do n't have to be so tough .
KELLY: I 'm fine . I uh I 'm fine .
HECTOR: I 'm sorry . A beat .
KEOUGH: Yup .
HECTOR: Whenever somebody dies I conside it such a waste that I did n't know him better . A beat . Then
KEOUGH: His head was just bitten off .
HECTOR: I used to have this recurring nightmare that I was headless .
KEOUGH: You know , Hector , I 'm sure you 're a fine person in your own mental way . But I think it would be best if you and I did n't speak .
HECTOR: This is a setback .
KEOUGH: You do n't want to cut me down . 'Cause I 'll kill you .
KELLY: Hard to believe there could be a monster under such peacefulness .
JACK: I thought I might track the shoreline tomorrow , look fo prints .
KELLY: Excuse me ?
JACK: When you get scared , the brain eleases a chemical , same chemical it releases when somebody 's in high school , the thing to do was to take the girl to a scary movie .
KELLY: What are you talking about ?
JACK: I 'm saying between the moonlight , a beautiful lake and a monster that ites heads off you look good .
KELLY: Gee , that was so poetic , Jack . I 'm all moist .
JACK: Forgive me for trying to be nice .
KELLY: Nice ? Nice would be `` you look pretty , '' nice is not some man- eating monster has tricked my brain into making you look good .
JACK: I did n't say it like that .
KELLY: You did , you
JACK: I was trying to pay you a compliment , I was guising it as science 'cause I know you 're comfortable in that arena . Science .
KELLY: A man just died , you 're hitting on me with science .
JACK: Just forget it .
HECTOR: Beg pardon ? Sorry to intrude but Hank seems to have gotten himself stuck in a tree .
KELLY: Hank ?
KEOUGH: Yes . The three exchange looks .
KELLY: Are you okay ?
KEOUGH: Other than feeling slightly embarrassed , I 'm perfectly fine . Could you cut me down ?
HECTOR: Promise you wo n't kill me , first .
KEOUGH: I have no interest in ever looking at you , Hector . Could you please cut me down ? Jack gives Kelly a knife .
JACK: You cut , we 'll hold him .
KEOUGH: Thank you . I lied .
KELLY: You 're cut .
HECTOR: Are you sure ?
KELLY: Scales were oval . It was an Asian crocodile .
KEOUGH: Asia ? How how could he get here ?
HECTOR: Obviously some asshole in Hong Kong flushed him down a toilet .
KELLY: He had to be thirty feet long . Another beat .
JACK: Hank . The little cannon you ought , get it . Guard the shoreline . Otherwise , we 're done . We made the I.D. , our job is finished .
KEOUGH: Alright , Ms. Paleontologist . I wan na know why that monster is here . You got a theory ?
KELLY: Why he 's that big , I do n't know . Why he 's here the wetlands are eing developed , crocodiles are moving . Australia , Fiji , the things have started to cross oceans .
JACK: But why Maine and why alone ? Crocs are social , why 's this guy on the move by himself ?
HECTOR: Maybe he does n't play well with others .
KEOUGH: Is everything a big fucking joke to you ?
HECTOR: Bite my bishop .
KEOUGH: I 'm sick of him !
KELLY: Hank !
KEOUGH: He said he knew Karate !
HECTOR: At school they 'd always say `` go '' first .
JACK: Get your big gun and guard the shore . Hector . Go to your tent .
HECTOR: He never said `` go '' .
JACK: Get the gun .
KEOUGH: If I fall into a hole or get hoisted into a tree And he 's gone .
JACK: Like little children . You okay ?
KELLY: Yeah . I got some stuff for you cut .
JACK: I could n't believe did you see the size of that thing 's mouth ?
KELLY: I wonder if he 's some kind of mutant . That bear had to be surprised .
JACK: Let 's get away from the shore .
KELLY: It 's okay . They hold a look .
TOM: There it is .
STEVE: Last one in 's a dead man .
JACK: Ow . Shit .
KELLY: Just got ta pull it a little tighter .
JACK: Who taught you be be a nurse ?
KELLY: Father 's a surgeon . I can even stitch in a pinch , would n't be a ad idea here .
JACK: No thanks .
KELLY: Keep it dry . No swimming .
JACK: Thank you . They hold a look . Then
KELLY: What ? Why people have been killed , I hardly think I 'm having a good time , why would Does it show ? Jack nods slightly .
JACK: That 's why you 're here . To get in the middle of something ?
KELLY: Maybe . I 've always read about what 's happened . I 've never I know it sounds silly but , it 's nice to be someplace while something is actually y'know happening . Something is happening right now . A beat .
JACK: Thanks for the bandaid .
KELLY: Night .
JANINE: Here I come . Ready or not .
STEVE: All or nothing , Tom .
TOM: From the jaws of defeat
STEVE: Ha ha . Another beat . Still no sign of Tommy .
JANINE: Tommy ? This is n't funny , Tommy .
STEVE: Tommy ?
DANNY: C'mon , Tommy . And now they 're starting to panic .
JANINE: Where is he ?
DANNY: This is n't funny ! !
HECTOR: What 's that ?
KEOUGH: It came from across the lake .
JACK: You said nobody came in here !
KEOUGH: Obviously I was wrong !
JANINE: He just took him in his jaws .
KEOUGH: He was in his mouth ? !
JANINE: Yes .
JACK: You 're okay ?
TOMMY: I think ; just cuts .
DANNY: The thing just came up out of the water and kind of spit him at us .
JANINE: You should have signs posted , fo God 's sake !
JACK: You 're really okay ? Tommy nods . Then
TOMMY: I might need a Tetanus . Keough and Jack exchange a look of disbelief .
HECTOR: Just spit him back out . Some shall live , some shall die , arbitrarily , sound like any higher power we know ?
KEOUGH: He did n't eat the kid cause he 'd just swallowed a bear .
HECTOR: Sobek . Half man , half croc , oldest God
KEOUGH: I 'm tired , Hector . I know this ecause you 're beginning to not bug me .
HECTOR: That sounds good but underneath it 's hurtful . Nightcap ?
KEOUGH: Raincheck .
JACK: Well . Goodnight .
KELLY: We seem to say goodnight a lot .
JACK: We could not say it and Well , that thing is ambulatory if you want somebody in your tent to She smiles . Then
KELLY: Night .
JACK: Get back from the shore . We know how fast he can leap out .
KEOUGH: We should n't even really be doing this .
JACK: They wo n't be here till at least noon . We got a few hours to kill .
KEOUGH: So does he .
KELLY: I 'm gon na get ticks . I know it . They 're drawn to me . I got a thing about ticks .
JACK: Ssssh !
KELLY: What ?
JACK: I heard something .
KELLY: Shit , shit , shit , shit , shit .
KEOUGH: Look .
JACK: Guard the water .
GARE: It seems like we 're getting lower .
HECTOR: It happens when I land .
GARE: Why are we landing ?
HECTOR: 'Cause this is the cove he obviously lives in .
GARE: So why are we landing ? Hector .
KELLY: Thing we can lift it ?
JACK: Maybe . Do n't mush it .
KELLY: I 'm not mushing it .
JACK: You 're mushing it a little around the
KELLY: I 'm not mushing it .
JACK: Okay . Okay . Okay .
KELLY: That is it ! !
JACK: Really
KELLY: No . I keep getting hit with heads !
JACK: Calm down .
KELLY: You calm down !
JACK: Calm down . She takes a couple of calming breaths .
KELLY: I 'm being very calm . I 'm composed . This is the second time I 've been hit with a severed head , I 'm entitled to complain .
STEVENS: Is that uh
KEOUGH: I ca n't recognize him from the ack . It looks like him .
KEOUGH: That 's him . What the ?
JACK: You got ta be kidding .
KELLY: What ?
JACK: Look .
KELLY: What is she doing now ? Mother of God .
KEOUGH: What ?
KELLY: Look ten feet into the water .
BICKERMAN: Come and get it .
KEOUGH: Oh , but you have , Ma'am . You lied to us , that could be obstruction of justice . A man 's been killed in part 'cause of your silence , I could make out a charge of reckless endangerment and I 'm sure PETA would be annoyed at how you treat your cows .
BICKERMAN: The reason I lied is if I 'd told you the truth , you 'd just hunt it down and kill it which seems to be exactly what you 're doing .
KELLY: How long have you been feeding this thing ?
BICKERMAN: About six years . He first appeared in May of nineteen-ninety-one . Bernie was out fishing and it followed him home . So we threw him some scraps and well he did n't seem to bother anybody . He became kind of like a pet who lived in the wild .
JACK: He just appeared . You have no idea how he arrived in this lake ?
BICKERMAN: No . Do you ?
KEOUGH: Ma'am . Your husband , Bernie . You did n't , by any chance , lead him to the lake blindfolded ?
BICKERMAN: No , I did not . The crocodile did kill him , though . But it was all it was a mistake .
KELLY: A mistake .
BICKERMAN: One of our horses got loose two years ago , went to the lake to drink and well the crocodile started coming in , Bernie went to intercede and it was all a terrible misunderstanding . If I reported it , they would 've sent people to kill it .
KEOUGH: Ma'am , how could you not report this ? He puts human life at risk and
BICKERMAN: Nobody lives on this lake . it 's eally his lake now .
GARE: C'mon Hector . I know you 're crazy ut you ca n't
HECTOR: I need to see his habitat . As he drops in .
GARE: Please . I 'll have sex with you , anything , but get out of the water .
HECTOR: He 's not gon na hurt me .
BICKERMAN: Murders and rapes in the cities . People bomb planes can the police stop them ? No . But feed one little cow to a crocodile
KEOUGH: You 're to wait right here until the police show , you 're under full house arrest .
BICKERMAN: Thank you , Officer Fuckmeat .
KEOUGH: What problem ?
HECTOR: Oh . my .
GARE: Hector ! !
HECTOR: Just turn the ignition , it 's fuel injected .
GARE: Come on . She turns it again and the ENGINE TURNS OVER .
HECTOR: I know under the circumstances , iting off my head might seem viable . It would cheapen you .
GARE: I might get a shot .
HECTOR: No . If you do n't kill him instantly , I 'm dead and you 'll only kill him instantly if you get his ain , which is about the size of a cherry . And even if you were on target , a bullet might not penetrate his hide .
GARE: Jesus . About twelve more yards . Keep coming just like that .
GARE: Oh my God .
HECTOR: Move over ! !
GARE: Go ! !
HECTOR: I 'm trying ! ! !
JACK: This time , I 'm gon na kick you ass .
HECTOR: Bastard bit my chopper .
JACK: Hey ! !
KELLY: Alright , Jack !
JACK: No ! You might think they 're Godly , you might get some spiritual lift ackstrokin ' with dragons but you just put a deputy at risk and
HECTOR: Let 's not overlook he did n't eat me , maybe
JACK: 'Cause he just ate a cow , you stupid
KELLY: Jack !
HECTOR: I 'm a civilian ! You do n't have any authority
KEOUGH: I can arrest you ! !
HECTOR: Then do it ! !
KEOUGH: You probably do want to be killed y it , that was you trying to meet your maker .
HECTOR: So profound and fat .
KELLY: Did you want to be killed by it ?
HECTOR: You think I 'm that nuts ?
KELLY: Hector . What you just did there was at least some sort of a death wish going on .
HECTOR: Nothing 's real .
KELLY: Excuse me ?
HECTOR: Nothing 's real . I 'm rich , people are automatically my friends , sycophants ooze out like oil slicks and and and He 's sounding erratic .
KELLY: I 'm no psychiatrist . But I would think there have to be bette places to look for autonomy , than
HECTOR: I 'm an empty man , Kelly , wealth has obbed me of the dream in life , I sit here broken , a hollow sack
KELLY: Oh , bullshit . And Hector drops the act .
HECTOR: Did n't even sound good ?
KELLY: No .
HECTOR: Eh . Fuck it .
KELLY: Can I tell them you wo n't go back in the water ?
HECTOR: Yes . You may . But maybe I do n't know He has trouble saying it .
KELLY: What ?
HECTOR: Could we have intercourse ?
JACK: Just heard from Wildlife and Florida Fish And Game . They should e here by four .
KELLY: Okay .
JACK: We might as well pack .
KELLY: Good idea .
HECTOR: They 're not going to be able to snag him in pitmans . Tranq him in water , he drowns .
KELLY: They could try to tranq him on land .
HECTOR: They wo n't . He 's taken human life , the mission will be to put him down .
KEOUGH: Gee , that would really disappoint me .
HECTOR: Forget about him being God , he 's thirty feet long , he is a miracle of nature , who somehow made his way to Maine . This is a grand beast . A grand dragon . An attempt should at least be made to capture him alive .
JACK: Well , you can try talking them into that , if
HECTOR: I have enough flaxedil with me to put him out . And I think I know a way to
JACK: Forget it .
HECTOR: Look . I know I 'm crazy , but when they come , they will kill it . They have to , politically , he 's too dangerous , if something were to go wrong the odds are he will be destroyed ,
KELLY: And how would we neutralize him ?
HECTOR: We lure him on land and pump him with the drugs .
JACK: No way .
HECTOR: Jack . We 've all seen it . He 's probably a hundred and fifty years old , he 's bigger than an elephant .
JACK: So maybe Wildlife will try to save him , they 're more equipped to
HECTOR: We both know what they 'll do . Silence . Admission by silence . Then
JACK: Even if we could tranq him how would we get him on land .
KEOUGH: Other than to eat us ?
HECTOR: He follows anything that moves . You guys can be in the trucks with tranq guns . If he charges , drive off , plus Hank you 've got your hand- held cannon . We could do this with no safety risk . If it works , we save a beast that should be saved . A beat . They are sympathetic to the idea .

LARRY CROWNE: That was a great presentation . I learned a lot from it .
MERCEDES TAINOT: When was the last time you looked at your life and saw nothing but fraud and desperation ?
DR. MATSUTANI: If the balance on Axis A is the same metric as Axis B you 're in deficits because of overhead , taxes , and re-investment .
THEN: Translation ? Ms. Francesco ?
TALIA: Something complicated .
DR. MATSUTANI: Ms. Pinedo ?

DENISE: That 's not my problem . Take out a loan on the house or something .
LARRY CROWNE: I tried . I 'm too much of a risk .
DENISE: Oh , I 'm not touching that . I do n't want to open up the whole lawye thing , but I will if pushed . Sucks , does n't it ? I appreciate the igorous Crowne honesty , but this ca n't happen .

HE STOPS: You have a lot of nerve showing your face on campus after ditching my class !
LARRY CROWNE: I 'm sorry , Ms. Tainot . I will not miss another class , this I vow .
MERCEDES TAINOT: Vows come cheap , Larry Crowne . You 'll lead off next assignment with three minutes on a personal first . A story , with details , not a laundry list or slide show . And , as I told Dibiasi , no one wants to hear about the first time you got laid . She eyes Talia with venom in her eyes .
TALIA: That woman is one clenched fist of fury .
LARRY CROWNE: Inappropriate subject in mixed company .
TALIA: You you want to fix it with you teacher ? Bang her .
LARRY CROWNE: She 's marred .
TALIA: You 'd kill two birds in one bush . Nothing wrong with a campus omance . Otherwise life is what ? Breakfast work , coffee , school , lunch , scoot , class , shop , talk , Mexican food , a movie , glass of wine or two then bed ? That 's not living .
THEN: If you 're any good She and the Stylist crack up !

PINEDO: Seeing them the Northern Lights , the Aurora Borealis should have een beyond me , but I was a little girl in Coach class still awake , a window seat , a moonless night somewhere over Greenland with a shimmering curtain of emerald , gossamer light dancing just for me .
THEN: That is something I will remembe forever .
MERCEDES TAINOT: Mr. Crowne ? A moment please ?

LARRY CROWNE: I 'm looking back on the year Denise left as the good old days .
LAMARR: Hang in there , neighbor .
LARRY CROWNE: Everyone keeps saying that .
LARRY CROWNE: The odds of two people on the same street winning the lottery are worse than one person on the street winning the lottery .
LAMARR: I read how the universe is expanding , Larry , taking us along with it . That is a wild concept to grasp , but what it means is , we all have to hold on tight sometimes to get to where we 're going to be .
THE PIPE: This thing must be making me dizzy . What ?

DEAN TAINOT: Point made .
THEN: So . What up .
MERCEDES TAINOT: Are we making a mistake here ?
MERCEDES TAINOT: Point made . We could change things . We could start right now .
DEAN TAINOT: We could . Why should we ?
MERCEDES TAINOT: Because we have history , Dean . But first , my thoughts I 've got to address drinking . I should be able to comprehend and respond to oth sides of our conversations . And the morning shower should be efreshing , not a hangover cure .
DEAN TAINOT: I 'd like that too .
MERCEDES TAINOT: Really ?
DEAN TAINOT: You 're not a pleasant woman after a few glasses . Mornings with you are to be survived .
MERCEDES TAINOT: Okay . Now , you . Dean is caught short .
DEAN TAINOT: I see . I 'm what this is all about .
MERCEDES TAINOT: There are plenty of items on the elationship agenda but let 's start here .

THEN: I 'll sign papers and checks , see if there 's enough for a cool sports car as a reward for the last few years and eventually I will be fine and you will too . But I am neve once going to look at myself as another poor divorced guy who could still be married if only he had done the mea culpa bit for all his faults .

JIMMY: I thought you were off the case .
HALLENBECK: Look , dipshit , I told you that to keep you out of my hair . My client 's dead and I have n't earned my fee .
JIMMY: Whoa , back up . You mean , we 're gon na nail these fuckers afte all ? Damn . I knew there was a hero lurking beneath that gruff exterior .
HALLENBECK: Yeah , I 'm a prince . Shut the fuck up .
JIMMY: Tell me about it . I 'm paying the fucking rent .
HALLENBECK: How charming . Sounds like a great girl . What else did you spring for ? Clothes ? Car payments ?
JIMMY: Was n't like that . Cory could 've had lots of rich guys . Me , she loved .
HALLENBECK: Oh . Love . Well , forget about it , then .
JIMMY: Let me guess . You do n't believe in love .
HALLENBECK: I believe in cancer . I believe in love .
JIMMY: What , they 're both diseases ?
HALLENBECK: Something like that . Jimmy shakes his head sadly .
JIMMY: Man , I do n't want to meet the itch that fucked you up .
HALLENBECK: I 'm sure she 'd love meeting you . Probably blow you on the front porch .
JIMMY: Little bitter , Joe ?
HALLENBECK: Eat shit .
JIMMY: Yes , massah .
HALLENBECK: Well , shit . Looks like somebody eat us to it .
JIMMY: Beat us to what ?
HALLENBECK: Whatever evidence Cory was holding .
JIMMY: Assuming there was any . Stay here a minute .
HALLENBECK: Where you going ?
JIMMY: Bathroom . You wan na come with me ? Doctor said I should n't lift anything heavy .
HALLENBECK: I 'll pass . Hallenbeck starts inspecting the wreckage .
HALLENBECK: Looks like you made it , baby . Jimmy emerges from the bathroom .
JIMMY: Find anything ?
HALLENBECK: Yeah , there 's some really nice ubble .
JIMMY: I may have something .
HALLENBECK: What ?
JIMMY: Later . Let 's get out of here .
HALLENBECK: Where the hell are you going ?
JIMMY: As long as we 're here , I might as well take Cory 's car .
HALLENBECK: You got the keys ?
JIMMY: Yeah . I 'll follow you .
HALLENBECK: Cory has two cars ?
JIMMY: Yeah . This one 's just sitting here until she can sell it . The color drains from Hallenbeck 's features .
HALLENBECK: Jimmy , no ! !
JIMMY: Ouch ! What 's your problem ?
ANOTHER ANGLE: Hallenbeck kneels and peers under the car .
HALLENBECK: They used a car bomb on Mike , it figures they 'd try it on her , too . Except they wired the wrong car . Jimmy pales noticeably .
JIMMY: Oh . Shit . Oh . Jeez . Hallenbeck claps him on the back .
HALLENBECK: Easy , kid . No harm , no foul . We caught it in time . He strolls toward his Plymouth , whistling . Cheerfully unaffected . Jimmy catches his breath . Swallows hard .
JIMMY: What are you doing ? Hallenbeck brandishes a pair of wire-cutters .
HALLENBECK: Got ta disconnect the fucker .
JIMMY: Whoa . Hold on . Um , should n't we call the bomb squad or something ?
HALLENBECK: Relax , Junior , I used to do this for a living .
JIMMY: No , man , I
HALLENBECK: Come on , chickenshit . Just snip the wire .
JIMMY: You 're a fucking asshole !
HALLENBECK: And then some , Junior . And then some .
JIMMY: Great . So what now ?
HALLENBECK: You tell me , kid .
JIMMY: Give up ? Flee ? Go really fa away ?
HALLENBECK: I got a better idea . Let 's check in with my family .
JIMMY: Sure . Family , huh ? You got kids ?
HALLENBECK: Yeah . Little girl .
JIMMY: Does she like you ?
HALLENBECK: Not much , no . And she likes Prince , so go figure .
JIMMY: I like Prince .
HALLENBECK: Great , you can marry my daughter . Or better yet , fuck my wife . I hear all it takes is a credit card and two valid I.D. 's . Open the trunk .
JIMMY: You 're just gon na stick that in your trunk ?
HALLENBECK: You 're right . Let 's leave it here for the neighborhood kids to play with .
TWO MEN: are approaching from out of the trees .
JIMMY: Is it the cops ?
HALLENBECK: No , Jimmy . It 's not the cops .
TALL MAN: Good evening , gentlemen . Bit late for a stroll , do n't you think ?
HALLENBECK: Yeah , you two better be getting home .
JIMMY: The streetlights are on .
TALL MAN: That 's amusing . How delightful to find such amusing men so late at night . I do n't believe I 've had the pleasure .
HALLENBECK: No , I do n't believe you have . He 'd like to have the pleasure .
JIMMY: Tell him it 's not for sale .
HALLENBECK: He says it 's
SHORT MAN: What 's your name , fuckface ?
HALLENBECK: I 'm asshole . He 's fuckface .
TALL MAN: Jake , apprise Rodney Dangerfield here of his situation .
TALL MAN: Perhaps we can dispense with the fun and games now , yes ?
HALLENBECK: Easy Jim All they want is the evidence
TALL MAN: The evidence . Very smart . See , Jake , he knows when a situation is untenable . You like that word ?
HALLENBECK: Great word .
TALL MAN: It occurs to me that you may have the evidence in question .
HALLENBECK: Give up , Jimmy . We 're dealing with geniuses .
JIMMY: Leave him alone , you fuck !
HALLENBECK: Back off , Jimmy . The Tall Man turns and eyes Jimmy .
TALL MAN: Leave him alone ? Whatever you say . Jake ?
TALL MAN: Ah , my young friend I neglected to tell you that Jake attacks his job with a certain exuberance .
JIMMY: Christ I 'm being beat up by the inventor of Scrabble .
TALL MAN: He 's still in a good mood , Jake . Kick him again . Jake steps forward .
HALLENBECK: Wait !
JIMMY: And then you 'll let us go , right ?
TALL MAN: Sure . We 'll let you go . Where is it ?
HALLENBECK: Hand me the car keys , Jimmy .
TALL MAN: Walk over and hand him the keys . Slow and easy .
HALLENBECK: The evidence is in the trunk .
TALL MAN: Open it . Slow .
HALLENBECK: I do n't think so .
TALL MAN: You dumb bastard , you 're going to pay for that . Jake , open the trunk .
JIMMY: Jesus fucking Christ ! They both dive for cover , out of the way . Barely make it . The CAR plows past them in a shower of dirt . CRUMPLING . Heaving . Spitting fire . Finally SLAMS to a halt against a palm tree . Burns . The night is filled with SHOUTS and CURSES .
HALLENBECK: You alive ?
JIMMY: Do n't know yet .
HALLENBECK: Either that , or we 're looking at a major factory recall .
JIMMY: Dead guys do n't make bad jokes , ight ?
HALLENBECK: Right .
JIMMY: So we 're alive .
HALLENBECK: Yeah . Hooray .
JIMMY: What ?
HALLENBECK: Get the fuck out of here , I 'll take the heat on this one . Rent a car . Then go home and wait fo my call . Do it .
BESSALO: Goddammit , this is a police matter , you son of a bitch ! I 'm sick and fucking tired of sweeping up you dead bodies , Joe , and the next time I see your ugly mug I 'm puttin ' a ullet in it . You got that ? You are off the case , buddy . Is that clear ?
JIMMY: If you thought there was dynamite in the trunk , wait 'll you see this .
HALLENBECK: Forget about him . Look at the guy on the right .
JIMMY: Sort of familiar . Who is he ?
HALLENBECK: Senator Calvin Baynard . Jimmy draws a sharp breath . Pause , then
JIMMY: Let 's go back to the cops . I 'm scared .
HALLENBECK: Take it easy , kid . It 's not so ad .
JIMMY: Not so bad . Excuse me , did you just say the words not so bad ? You do n't understand , Joe , see , if a guy vomits on the sidewalk , you do n't say , 'Oh , hey , it 's not so bad , there 's some ham in there . ' It 's fucking vomit , okay ? This is ad . Hallenbeck nervously lights a cigarette .
HALLENBECK: When I was thirty , I was on the President 's personal security force . Once night I was on the way home from a late session . I 'm on the highway just outside of Georgetown when I see something up ahead .
MEMORY FLASH: Another time . Another night . A younger-looking Hallenbeck . Rugged features . Clipped military haircut . He is driving .
STAGGERING DRUNK: is weaving toward Hallenbeck . Leaving behind his crumpled Mercedes .
DRUNK: Fuckin ' bitch She got in front of me , man . Shit . My fuckin ' car . Stupid bitch wrecked my car
HALLENBECK: The blow was non-lethal . But when he fell , his head hit the pavement funny . Put him in a coma .
HALLENBECK: Even when he came out of it , he was never right in the head . His dad fixed everything with the cops . The accident report disappeared . A week later the police found half a kilo of crack cocaine planted in my house . Acting on an anonymous tip .
JIMMY: The senator fucked your job .
HALLENBECK: And my pension . And my marriage . Only reason I 'm still licensed to carry a gun , the man himself made a few calls . Since then I 'm just playing it out . Day by day . Jimmy is silent for a moment . Then
JIMMY: Cory tumbled to some sort of deal etween Marcon and the senator , and they had her killed . We got ta show this photo to the cops .
HALLENBECK: Not yet . I need more evidence . I want Baynard , Jimmy . I want to ing him down . I could use you help .
JIMMY: Why should I help you ?
HALLENBECK: Because if Baynard takes a fall , so does Marcon . The man who kicked you out of professional football .
GIRL: I want the sheets changed , Milo .
MILO: Fine . It 's done . Right afte this next shot .
CAMERAMAN: Rolling .
MILO: And action ! The closet door opens . A hulking man emerges . He is carrying a chainsaw . The Girl on the bed stares , incredulous .
GIRL: Milo What the fuck is this , some kind of joke ?
MILO: Not at all , dearest . It 's what 's known as a snuff film .
GIRL: Oh God Milo please oh God oh no please Miloooo ! ! A smile twitches Milo 's upper lip .
MILO: Easy , Pablo . She 's not a piece of meat .
MILO: Yes , sir . And then ?
JIMMY: So I get to meet your family , huh ? What 's your daughter like ?
HALLENBECK: She 's like thirteen . And if you even look at her funny , I 'll shove an umbrella up your ass and open it .
DARIAN: I 'm watching television .
HALLENBECK: I can see that .
DARIAN: I hate you . Leave me alone .
HALLENBECK: She 's pissed off because I would n't let her go out on a date with he friend Billy .
DARIAN: I missed the biggest party of the year .
JIMMY: Why could n't she go ?
HALLENBECK: Because she 's thirteen , that 's why . I bought you some ice cream .
DARIAN: I 'm not talking to you .
HALLENBECK: Gee , that 's a shame . You always have such pleasant things to say . ' I hate you , Dad . ' I 'm gon na miss that , darn it It 's chocolate chip , your favorite .
DARIAN: I do n't care . You 're an asshole .
HALLENBECK: That 's for saying asshole . God , I hate wasting food . Wan na abuse me some more ? Go ahead , shock me . You know , I hardly ever hear the word asshole .
DARIAN: Bullshit , I bet you get it all the time .
HALLENBECK: All right , knock it off .
DARIAN: What 're you gon na do , ground me some more ?
HALLENBECK: Hey , you want it , you got it , lady .
DARIAN: Thank you , asshole .
HALLENBECK: You 're grounded for a week .
DARIAN: Yes , sir , asshole .
HALLENBECK: That 's two . You wan na play this game ? I love this game .
DARIAN: Just leave me alone . He thinks he 's fuckin ' Ward Cleaver .
HALLENBECK: All right , that 's it . You wan na e a gutter mouth ? You wan na sound like your mother , well that 's terrific . Christ , all day long I do n't take enough abuse , I got ta listen to shit from you !
JIMMY: Hey , Joe , take it easy
HALLENBECK: Do n't you tell me how to talk to my kid .
DARIAN: All I wanted was to go to a party , ut Pop here thinks I 'm out to get laid .
HALLENBECK: Go for it , kiddo . All the dirty words . Come on , shock me . Go ahead .
DARIAN: Sure thing , you dumb fuck-up .
HALLENBECK: All right , I 've had it . Go to your room . Or I will whip you ehind .
DARIAN: You 'd probably like it .
HALLENBECK: Goddammit , you are my daughte and you will respect me , got that ? You got it ? You do n't ever call me a fuck-up .
DARIAN: Why should n't I , Mom calls you that all the time . That stops him . He looks at her , stricken .
HALLENBECK: Your mother called me a fuck-up ? When ?
DARIAN: On the phone to Uncle Jay .
HALLENBECK: Uncle Jay ? Ohh , Christ , I 'm a fuck-up , but Uncle Jay , now there 's a real stand-up guy . Shit , the bastard cheats on his tax form , I 'm surprised he has n't done time ! Why do n't you ask you mother why Mister Wonderful is n't in jail for tax evasion ?
DARIAN: Because he does n't fuck up . She goes into her room and shuts the door .
JIMMY: You know , for fifty bucks you could get a guy to pull out he fingernails with a pair of pliers .
HALLENBECK: No . Anything that much fun , I 'd want to do myself .
JIMMY: I think we could both use a drink .
HALLENBECK: Yeah . That 's me .
JIMMY: You look like the dad on 'The Brady Bunch . '
HALLENBECK: Yeah , I was a regular Boy Scout .
JIMMY: So . You gon na get a divorce ?
HALLENBECK: Do n't know .
JIMMY: You do n't like women much , do you , Joe ?
HALLENBECK: Mike Miller was n't the first time . Sarah has cheated on me before . Twice . I never told her I knew . At first , my opinion of women took a real dip , yeah .
JIMMY: And now ?
HALLENBECK: Now I 'm content if I like the guy she 's fucking . This last one was my best friend .
JIMMY: Horseshit , he was a scumbag private eye .
HALLENBECK: What am I , Jimmy ?
JIMMY: He tried to get you killed .
HALLENBECK: Friends ca n't be perfect . I wish the sky was n't blue . I wish water was n't wet . I wish I did n't still love my wife . He eats in silence . Jimmy says
JIMMY: You know what I did last night ?
HALLENBECK: What ?
JIMMY: I went to a party and shit on a car .
HALLENBECK: Damn . You , too ?
JIMMY: I 'm a complete loser . Capital ' L . ' All I ever wanted was to be somebody 's hero , you know it ? Now I mostly sit around . Watch T.V . Get laid . I 'm a fucking slug , throw salt on me I 'd curl up . Life sucks .
HALLENBECK: You 're wrong .
JIMMY: Life does n't suck ?
HALLENBECK: No , life sucks . But you 're not a loser . Cory loved you .
JIMMY: Yeah , and the last thing I did was cheat on her . Why do people cheat , Joe ?
HALLENBECK: Because it 's easier than paying the tax , Junior .
JIMMY: Ooooooh . Very deep .
HALLENBECK: So deep I do n't know what the fuck it means .
JIMMY: It means another drink is required . He raises the bottle .
HALLENBECK: Is Alex your accountant ?
JIMMY: No . But he could have been . Alex was my son . Hallenbeck stares at him .
HALLENBECK: I 'm sorry .
JIMMY: I think about him a lot . I mean , who was this guy ?
HALLENBECK: He would have been a great all player . Like his dad .
JIMMY: No . He had to die , Joe . Do n't you see ?
HALLENBECK: Why did he have to die ?
JIMMY: Because he came out of me . He puts aside the bottle . Scowls .
HALLENBECK: Not in my house , you dum motherfucker .
JIMMY: Joe , man , you do n't get it
HALLENBECK: Shut up . He picks up the vial of powder .
JIMMY: Joe , please ! Joe drops the vial in the water . Flushes . Jimmy darts forward . Joe shoves him back .
HALLENBECK: You got it , son . I 'm just mixing it in with all the other shit . Get the fuck out of my house . Now .
JIMMY: You do n't understand .
HALLENBECK: I said , get out . I 'll break you fucking neck , kiddo . Jimmy glares at him . Coldly defiant .
JIMMY: Go ahead , tough guy . Go ahead . I 'm trying to survive , man . I use that stuff to get by , so fuck you .
HALLENBECK: I do n't use it . I get by .
JIMMY: Oh , sure , Dudley fucking Do-Right , you stand there and judge me , and , meanwhile , you never had your old lady die on you , did you , pal ? ? And your fucking kid ? ? And I said to God , 'Hey , buddy , what gives ? I go to church , I give to the United Way , what is this dead wife and kid shit ? ' And he did n't say nothin ' , Joe .
HALLENBECK: When you 're through feeling sorry for yourself , the front door 's that way .
JIMMY: You 're a total bastard .
HALLENBECK: You brought cocaine in my house . End of story .
DARIAN: You 're Jimmy Dix , are n't you ?
JIMMY: Huh ?
DARIAN: I 'm sorry I acted like a bitch . Would you sign my card ? Hallenbeck steps forward .
HALLENBECK: I told you to go to your room .
DARIAN: But , Dad !
HALLENBECK: Go to bed . This guy 's not signing anything .
DARIAN: Aw , come off it .
HALLENBECK: Forget it , Darian . The guy 's a loser . Big time . Darian 's face is a mask of confusion .
JIMMY: I never shaved points , Joe . I never did . Joe is silent . Stone-faced .
HALLENBECK: Smile , you fuck .
DARIAN: Billy Hallenbeck recoils . Stares at her . The DOORBELL RINGS . Startling him . He mutters under his breath . Stalks out of the room .
HALLENBECK: Goddammit , Jimmy , I told you ! It is n't Jimmy .
MILO: Good morning , Joseph . He FIRES point-blank . The electrode hits Hallenbeck in the chest .
PABLO: Good morning , Jimmy .
JIMMY: Who are you , and how the fuck do you know my name ?
CHET: This is the guy ? You sure it 's the guy ?
PABLO: This is him .
CHET: The kid with the million-dolla arm ?
PABLO: Yeah .
CHET: Shit . He do n't look like much . I would n't pay no million dollars for this bozo .
PABLO: Neither will anyone else , anymore .
JIMMY: I 'm growing whiskers here , guys . You got something to say , fucking say it .
CHET: Wow . Tough guy stuff . Must have caught it from his buddy Hallenbeck .
JIMMY: Who ?
PABLO: Do n't play dumb , shithead . You were with him last night at the club .
CHET: Mr. Marcon sent us to teach you a lesson , Jimmy . Something about keeping your big coked-up nose out of his fucking business .
PABLO: Get ready , kid . This one 's an E ticket .
JIMMY: Please , guys , do n't do this Jesus Christ , I was just he oyfriend , I swear to God , please ! They toss Jimmy over the fence .
JIMMY: Oh , God , my arm , my fucking arm , oh Jesus Christ ! ! !
BESSALO: Gimmee the bad news first . McCASKEY Bad news is , they just pulled Jimmy Dix out of a construction site on Ventura . He 's busted up .
BESSALO: He lied . Why did he lie ? Realization hits him like a thunderbolt .
HAND: comes INTO FRAME and slaps him . Hard . Rocks his head to one side .
CHET: I think he 's awake .
PABLO: Make sure . Chet 's hand flashes out for a third slap
HALLENBECK: I 'm awake . His eyelids creak open . He squints , adjusting to the light . Studies his captors .
CHET: You nearly broke my wrist , man .
HALLENBECK: Life 's a bitch .
PABLO: Milo warned us to watch out fo this guy .
CHET: Fuck that . Look at him . He 's nothin ' . Guy 's a piece of shit .
HALLENBECK: Anybody got a cigarette ? Chet steps forward . Grins wickedly .
CHET: Sure , buddy . I got a cigarette .
HALLENBECK: I seem to have dropped my cigarette . May I have another ?
CHET: Sure . Sure thing , buddy .
HALLENBECK: I need a light . And if you touch me again I 'll kill you . A pregnant pause . The challenge hangs in the air .
CHET: Baby ! Two for two ! The laughter continues . Hallenbeck takes a deep breath . Stands up . Strikes with a flattened palm . Breaks Chet 's nose . Drives it up into the brain . Chet stands , pole-axed . Blinks once . Pitches over dead . And suddenly Pablo is n't laughing . He stares at Hallenbeck , incredulous . Stares at Chet , lying on the carpet .
PABLO: Jesus Christ . You son-of-a-bitch . Jesus Christ ! ! He rushes to Chet . Kneels beside him . Hallenbeck calmly returns to his seat .
MILO: Is there a problem ?
PABLO: He killed Chet , Milo . The mother- fucker just killed him !
MILO: Oh , my . Oh , Goddamn . Joseph , Joseph , you do n't disappoint me .
HALLENBECK: I needed a light . Milo nods as if this makes perfect sense .
MILO: You took an awful risk . Pablo here could have shot you dead .
HALLENBECK: If you wanted me dead , you 'd have already killed me .
MILO: Yes , that 's true . I suppose introductions are in order .
HALLENBECK: Fuck it . You 're the bad guy , ight ?
MILO: Yes . I 'm the bad guy .
HALLENBECK: And you 've got the gun , and I 'm supposed to tremble in fear , something like that ?
MILO: Something like that .
HALLENBECK: Fine . I 'll start trembling in a minute . Mind if I have a drink first ?
MILO: I do n't see why not . Pablo , please take Chet 's corpse into the other room , and then fix Mr. Hallenbeck a drink . Suddenly a voice rings out from the doorway
HALLENBECK: Hey , look who 's here . Connie Marcon himself .
MARCON: Careful , son . Only my friends call me Connie .
HALLENBECK: You got friends ? When did this happen ?
MARCON: I 'll give you one thing . You 're pretty calm for a man in you position .
HALLENBECK: You 're pretty calm for a man whose team is three and six on the year .
MARCON: They 're having some problems .
HALLENBECK: They stink .
MARCON: I 'm glad you 're here , Joe . We got a few things to discuss . He takes a moment to gather his thoughts .
HALLENBECK: When do I say the Pledge of Allegiance ? Marcon looks directly at Hallenbeck .
MARCON: Do you know how many ratings points Monday Night Football lost this year ? Per week ? An average of two point eight .
HALLENBECK: Oh , for Chrissake . You 're telling me this whole thing is about TV atings ?
MARCON: People have stopped watching , Joe ! Everybody 's turning the channel , they 're still looking for heroes , you follow ? Guys like you . Milo here tells me you took a bullet for the President , jumped in front of a sniper rifle . Hallenbeck reacts , startled . Looks at Milo .
MILO: We took the liberty of researching your background .
MARCON: How about it , Joe ? Is it truth o hype ?
HALLENBECK: I got the rifle in my closet as a souvenir .
MARCON: There you go , that 's what I 'm saying . The public wants real heroes . Not a bunch of football prima donnas , jumping from team to team with their fancy lawyers . In fact , Joe , and this is my point , there 's only one reason left nowadays to watch pro- football . Can you guess ? It begins to dawn on Hallenbeck .
HALLENBECK: Gambling .
MARCON: Exactly . Gambling . Just one problem football gambling is illegal in all but two of the fifty states . And that , Joe boy , is where I come in .
HALLENBECK: Shit , that 's what this is about ! You 're bribing United States senators . Paying them to pass legislation
MARCON: Legalizing football gambling in all fifty states . Exactly .
HALLENBECK: Attendance goes up again . TV atings go up again .
MARCON: You got it , son . The networks are happy . I 'm happy . Everybody 's happy .
HALLENBECK: Before we get too fucking happy , let 's get a couple things straight first , I 'm not your fucking son , and second why am I still alive ?
MARCON: It 's like this , Joe everything was going great until a couple weeks ago , and then I hit a snag Senator Calvin Baynard .
HALLENBECK: I do n't get it . What 's the snag ?
MARCON: I offered him the bribe and he would n't take it .
HALLEBECK: Baynard ? Are you nuts ? The guy 's so crooked he shits slinkies .
MARCON: Allow me to clarify I offered him the bribe , and he turned it down because he wanted more money .
HALLENBECK: Thank God . For a minute there I felt hell freezing over . Did he ask for more than a million ?
MARCON: Does the Pope shit in the woods ? He wants two million or he 'll low the lid off my whole plan . I do n't feel like paying no two mil , so basically that good ole ' oy 's got ta die .
HALLENBECK: Taking off a U.S. senator , that 's pretty ballsy . Even for an asshole like you .
MARCON: Oh , I 'm not going to kill Baynard , Joe .
HALLENBECK: Who is ?
MARCON: Anything goes wrong , all the heat lands on you , Joe boy . My hands are clean . Hallenbeck scowls .
HALLENBECK: Any particular reason I should go along with this prize-winning scheme ?
MARCON: Just one .
SARAH: Do what he says , Joe . Joe sits . Breathing shallowly . Eyes locked on Milo .
HALLENBECK: Are you alright , Sarah ?
SARAH: Yes .
MILO: That 's a temporary condition , Joseph . As you may be aware , there are distributors in Mexico who positively crave snuff films . And unless you do every fucking thing Mr. Marcon tells you you wife will make her motion picture debut . He meets Joe 's murderous gaze and smiles .
JIMMY: Look , I 'll say it again for the cheap seats I do n't know anything and I ca n't help you . Okay ? Can I go now ? Bessalo grimaces in disgust .
BESSALO: Let me get this straight you 're walking along , minding your own usiness , when two guys you neve met jump you and throw you in a ditch for no particular reason . Is that it ?
JIMMY: That 's it .
BESSALO: You 're full of shit , kid . Tell me where Hallenbeck is .
JIMMY: How the fuck should I know ? Try his house .
BESSALO: We did . Where is he ?
JIMMY: For Chrissake , I just met the guy . Look , Sergeant . I do n't give a shit about Joe Hallenbeck . I just usted my throwing arm and I 'm in a real pissy mood , so you got two choices either charge me with something or let me the fuck outta here . He glares defiantly at Bessalo .
JIMMY: Hey . Wake up . She stirs . Awakens , looking at him . Her eyes are puffy and red from crying . Her hair is a tangled mess .
PABLO: Get up .
HALLENBECK: Go fuck yourself .
PABLO: Time for a little payback , Joe . Call it a service to dear departed Chet . He slams a fist into Hallenbeck 's middle . Sarah cries out in alarm .
HALLENBECK: I 'm asshole she 's fuckhead . And with that , Pablo lets him have it . Rains punches on his chest and gut . Slams an elbow into his kidneys . Drives a knee into his groin . Joe hits the deck . Milo calls out from the boat
MILO: Easy , Pablo . I want him conscious . Pablo is kicking Joe 's prone form .
SARAH: Goddamn you , stop it ! ! Oh , Jesus , leave him alone !
HALLENBECK: Do n't look at me
SARAH: Shhh . It 's okay , Joe . I 'm here , it 's okay . I love you , Joe .
HALLENBECK: I get the shit beat out of me puke all over myself and now you love me ?
SARAH: I never stopped loving you , Joe .
HALLENBECK: Christ , you slept with three guys .
SARAH: You knew about the others ?
HALLENBECK: I knew .
SARAH: You never said anything .
HALLENBECK: Figured you needed them .
SARAH: Joe , Goddammit , why did n't you say something ?
HALLENBECK: Like what ? 'Fuck you , Sarah ' ?
SARAH: Yes . Fuck you , Sarah ! Anything to show that you that you had some pride left . A pause . Then Hallenbeck heaves a sigh .
HALLENBECK: Sorry I 'm fresh out .
SARAH: I 'm scared , Joe . Get me out of this .
HALLENBECK: Must be my trick ear . Sounded like you said , 'Get me out of this . '
SARAH: You can take these guys , Joe .
HALLENBECK: I 've got cracked ribs and a concussion .
SARAH: Save me , Joe . Be a hero .
HALLENBECK: I do n't believe in heroes .
SARAH: That 's no excuse .
HALLENBECK: Fuck you , Sarah And he smiles . Just then , Milo signals from the boat .
PABLO: All right , lovebirds , break it up . He yanks Sarah to her feet . Lets his gaze roam up and down her body .
PABLO: Stay down , fucker . Do n't you move .
MILO: Careful , Pablo . We do n't want to get Mrs. Hallenbeck all excited in front of hubby . He squats next to Joe .
HALLENBECK: You 're gon na kill us both anyway .
MILO: Perhaps . But there are ways to die , and then there are ways to die . Capisce ? You determine you wife 's fate . He yanks Hallenbeck to his feet . Propels him toward the boat .
SARAH: Joe ! He stops . Turns . Looks at her .
HALLENBECK: I 'll be back . That 's a promise . Milo clubs Joe in the head with his pistol .
MILO: You 're wasting my time , Joseph . Let 's go .
HALLENBECK: If you touch me again I 'll kill you . They stare into each other 's eyes . Hallenbeck does not give an inch . Milo hits him again .
JIMMY: I need to borrow a gun , Henry .
MARCON: Marcon .

DARIAN: What do you need a boat for ?
JIMMY: I 'm gon na crash a party out on Catalina . Marcon will be there .
DARIAN: Maybe we should call the police .
JIMMY: No , honey . Not now . There 's some ig shots involved in this mess , and it 's my word against theirs . If I blab to the cops , your mom and dad will disappear and they 'll never find the bodies . I 'm sorry , Darian .
DARIAN: So what do we do ?
JIMMY: What I do is confront Conrad Marcon and threaten to go to the cops , unless he gives them back .
DARIAN: Is that gon na work ?
JIMMY: Beats me , but I think it 's what your dad would do .
DARIAN: I 'm scared .
JIMMY: Me , too , honey .
DARIAN: I do n't know . I thought you 'd know what happened , know what to do I mean , you were one of my dad 's ig heroes . Jimmy almost chokes

MILO: Your wife 's very pretty .
HALLENBECK: Fuck you , cocksucker .
MILO: My , my . Little testy this evening .
HALLENBECK: Nope .
MILO: What would you do ?
HALLENBECK: I 'd go off and suck some cock and leave him the fuck alone .
MILO: It occurs to me , Joseph , that I would very much like to hear you scream .
HALLENBECK: Come again ?
MILO: You 're so cool , are n't you ? So if you 'll pardon the expression hard-boiled . I 'd like , just once , to hear you scream in pain .
HALLENBECK: Play some rap music . Milo chuckles , shakes his head .
MILO: Fascinating .
HALLENBECK: When do I kill Baynard ?
MILO: Come now , Joseph , did you really think that I 'd hand you a loaded gun ? You 're not really going to kill anyone .
HALLENBECK: I 'm not ?
MILO: No . He leans forward .

MILO: At eight-fifteen , Senator Baynard will leave the party , hopefully unobserved . He and his entourage will board a fast boat , and endezvous with us at sea .
HALLENBECK: Jesus . He thinks he 's geting his two-million-dollar payoff .
MILO: Baynard will not leave his boat . One of his men will board us , and inspect the contents of the suitcase . This suitcast .
HALLENBECK: Plastics ?
MILO: Detonation upon opening . Enough to kill the passengers , not enough to sink the craft . And when we place your charred corpse amidst the wreckage , the police will draw the inevitable conclusion a down-on-his-luck P.I . makes a suicide strike against the man who cost a career .
HALLENBECK: That sounds lovely , but how is my ody gon na get charred ?
MILO: Maybe I 'll get to hear you scream , after all

HALLENBECK: What cop ?
PABLO: That one .

MARCON: You know I do n't enjoy doin ' this , Jim .
JIMMY: Nobody knows . Just just me and Hallenbeck
MARCON: Now , see , I 'd love to believe you . But we are talking about the future of my football team .
MARCON: And ai n't nothin ' more important than my ball club , 'cept maybe my collection of autographed footballs . Got one of yours , you know . Who 'd you talk to , Jimmy ?
JIMMY: Nobody Marcon raises the poker . Brings it down on Jimmy 's broken arm .
HARDGUY: Mr. Marcon ?

HALLENBECK: You drop it , asshole , or I kill Marcon . The Strange Man chuckles .
STRANGE MAN: Sorry , but that wo n't work . I do n't care if he lives or dies , now drop the gun .
HALLENBECK: Well , Goddamn . How 's the head , Lou ?
JIMMY: Shit . This is the drunk guy you slugged , look what you did to his face !
MARCON: You son of a bitch , you were gon na let him kill me !
BAYNARD: Nothing more or less than you 'd do for me , Conrad . I never thought I 'd see you again , Joe .
HALLENBECK: Speaking of which , what the fuck are you doing here ?
BAYNARD: Call it a financial partnership . For a price , I agreed to connect Mr. Marcon to the necessary people in Washington .
HALLENBECK: In other words , you dropped you father 's name a bunch of times .
BAYNARD: But imagine my delight this morning , Joe , when Mr. Marcon informed me of a golden opportunity a chance to kill my father and frame you fo the crime What can I say , inherit a fortune and humiliate you in the bargain , who could resist ?
HALLENBECK: Do I also have you to thank fo dragging me into this mess ?
BAYNARD: It was I , unfortunately , who ought a forty-dollar bottle of champagne spoke a little too freely to that hooker .
JIMMY: She was n't a hooker , dickhead .
HALLENBECK: He should know , Jimmy . With a face like that , he 's got ta be paying for it .
BAYNARD: You can die fast or slow , so watch your mouth . Jimmy chimes in
JIMMY: We 'd rather watch yours . It 's goofy-lookin ' .
MARCON: Kill them , Goddammit , waste 'em oth !
JIMMY: Any bright ideas , Joe ?
HALLENBECK: Gimmee a minute .
JIMMY: Excuse me , could you give him a minute ? He 's trying to think of a way out of this .
HALLENBECK: You know of course , Connie , that you 're a dead man . Marcon holds up his hand .
MARCON: Wait . The gunmen lower their weapons .
HALLENBECK: Nothing much , just that I made a phone call from the boat on the way in .
MARCON: You called the cops ? Fuck it , they ca n't prove a thing .
HALLENBECK: Oh , but I did n't call the cops . I called the mob . Marcon stares at him . Blinks .
MARCON: He 's bluffing . He 's not connected to the mob , what a load of horseshit . Nice try , asshole . Kill them .
HALLENBECK: Then there 's the matter of two million dollars . Or did n't you know that watertight suitcases float ? He once again looks Marcon in the eye .
MARCON: Jesus , I do n't believe it . This guy 's a riot .
JIMMY: I do n't think it 's working , Joe . Try another one .
HALLENBECK: Hell , I 'm fresh out . You wan na try one , kid , go for it .
JIMMY: Fuck you , Joe , I 'm not just gon na stand here and die . Mr. Marcon , he 's lying . We do have the money , ut it 's not in a car , it 's in a storage locker . I have the key on me . I ' l hand it over if you let me go . Hallenbeck stares in disbelief . The kid 's actually trying something .
MARCON: Where is the key , Jimmy ?
JIMMY: It 's stashed in my shorts .
MARCON: All right . Slow and easy .
JIMMY: Sure . Slow and easy .
MARCON: Hell with that , son . Hand it ove or I 'll have you kneecapped .
JIMMY: Oh , yeah ? Well , that 's too bad . See , it 's one of those new plastic keys . The kind that melt ? And , with that , he hurls it into the fire .
MARCON: Pull it out of there ! One of them grabs a pair of tongs and the SHREDDER EXPLODES .
HALLENBECK: Plastic keys ? The kind that melt ?
JIMMY: Hey . Short notice , best I could do .
HALLENBECK: You did fine , junior .
JIMMY: Learned it from a pro . Come on .
HALLENBECK: Forget about him . Let 's get my wife .
HALLENBECK: Get in . He 's so slick , it 's scary .
MARCON: Shit , Joe Boy , you was n't luffing He draws his gun . Blows out the glass . Reaches in . Opens the car door . Snatches up the briefcase .
JIMMY: I 'm new at this , Joe . How do we do it ?

SARAH: Will the police catch Marcon ?
HALLENBECK: Maybe . He 's probably in some secret crash pad , packing to leave town . A pause , then Sarah says
SARAH: I remember when we got married My friends would talk about thei husbands . They 'd say , 'Oh , my husband is a big-time publisher , ' or , 'My husband is a brilliant lawyer ' I used to say , 'My husband can stand over a shotgun victim and eat a ham sandwich without puking . '
HALLENBECK: Do n't knock it . It 's a skill . She turns . Looks into his eyes .
SARAH: I want to try , Joe . Do you still want to try ?
HALLENBECK: Ahh , shit . Looks like the local constable has come to chat .
SARAH: Shall we invite him in ?
HALLENBECK: No . Stay here . I 'll deal with it .

KATE: She means well . She 's just had a tough run . My Father ran off to France with his secretary . Then mum got cancer , about four years ago now . She 's fully recovered . But wo n't admit it . She 's basically bored . And my continued ` situation ' as she calls it , being single , is her majo distraction . Her pastime if you will .

KATE: Do you ever wish you could try a different life ? Just for a day . Just to see what it would be like .
HARVEY: What would yours be ?
KATE: Well , no green , that 's for sure .
HARVEY: And what would you do there ?
KATE: OhI do n't know Write the great novel . I think I 've got one inside me . We 're not talking high art . Just a loody good holiday read .

NIKKI: It 's getting pretty late , is n't it ?
CARY: Do you want to go home , Nikki ? I 'll take you home . Where do you live ?
NIKKI: Hotel Carlton .
BILL: I 'll take her home , too .

BILL: We camped on your doorsteps last night . And this morning we all moved in .
CARY: Despite your practically innumerable faults , we adore you . We 've decided to adopt you .
BILL: Well , for heaven 's sakes ! Look at Nikki ! What are you having done to yourself , gal ?
SHEP: Whatcha having your toes painted for , Nikki ?
NIKKI: I do n't know . Seemed like a good idea at the time .
BILL: Why , look at Nikki 's legs , would you ? That there is practically the loveliest pair of legs I ever saw in all my born days .
NIKKI: Like my legs ?
SHEP: Look at those legs , Cary . My , they nearly match .

FRINK: I Well
BILL: Have a drink ?
FRINK: No , thanks .
SHEP: Cure the shakes .
FRINK: I have n't got the shakes .
CARY: Let 's see . Hold out your hands .
FRINK: Hey . Take these off .
CARY: Now , let 's see . Where were we before we were so rudely interrupted ?
BILL: We were talkin ' about Nikki 's legs .
CARY: That 's right . We were talkin ' about Nikki 's legs . And havin ' a fine time , too .
WOMAN: Finis .
SHEP: Let 's inspect the job .
NIKKI: Oh , my poor toes . Do n't look too close .
CARY: Well , what 's the matter with you toes ?
NIKKI: Well when I was a little girl
BILL: Oh , take her away ! She 's breakin ' my heart !
NIKKI: And when I got home my toes were spoiled .
CARY: Oh , dear , oh , dear .
SHEP: That 's such a sad story . Let 's all have a drink , quick !
NIKKI: And now would you all excuse me ? On account of I 'm gon na put on a dress .

FRINK: You guys think you 're so darn smart .
CARY: Well , cheerio , fellas . I 'm off .
SHEP: Well , on account of it 's raining and everything , we thought we 'd go ove to the Cluny and play billiards and drink beer .
NIKKI: Do you think Cary might object ?
SHEP: Well , I have an idea he 'd like to be alone .
NIKKI: Why alone ?
SHEP: Well , Cary likes to be alone . He 's as brittle as a breadstick . One silly crack from you and he might eak up in sections .
NIKKI: Well , then , I do n't think he should e left alone . Tell me , what 's Cary doing in Paris ?
SHEP: What are we all doing in Paris ?
NIKKI: I know . But why does n't he go home ?
SHEP: Well , he 's not ready to go home . What could he do if he went home ? Have people cry over his hands ?
NIKKI: Well , it seems - a pity to go on like this . He 's such a sweet soul .
SHEP: One of the best .
NIKKI: Is n't he just sort of wasting himself ?
SHEP: On the contrary . He 's trying awfully hard to get hold of himself .
NIKKI: Oh , I wo n't . Why , who ever heard of such a thing ?
NIKKI: Cary ? ! Cary ? I 'm coming with you .
SHEP: What are you changing your shoes for ?
NIKKI: On account of I can walk faster in ed shoes .
CARY: Perhaps we 'd better stay here a while till it clears up .
NIKKI: Could we sit down here , do you suppose ?
CARY: I think so . Would you like something to drink ?
NIKKI: What should I drink now , do you suppose ?
CARY: Deux picon citrons .
NIKKI: Picon citrons ?
CARY: Very refreshing . Make you laugh and play .
NIKKI: That 's what you always promise . Cary , why does Shep Lambert go on drinking so desperately ?
CARY: Do n't we all ?
NIKKI: Not like Shep .
CARY: Well , Shep has that tic under his eye , you know . Takes a lot of drinks to keep that quiet .
NIKKI: But is n't there some kind of treatment or something ?
CARY: Shep could never stand a long course of treatment . Drinking 's the only corrective so far as he 's concerned . He 's found out the tic does n't work when he 's tight . So he stays tight .
NIKKI: Seems such a pity . How did he get the tic ?
CARY: In the war .
NIKKI: I know . But how ?
CARY: Well , it 's not very romantic .
NIKKI: Well , do n't tell me if you do n't want to .
CARY: Well , you see , a tic is a nervous habit .
NIKKI: Yes ?
CARY: Lice under his bandages .
NIKKI: Oh .
CARY: He had the devil of a time . He nearly lost his mind . So you 'll have to excuse him a little .
NIKKI: I 'm so sorry for Shep .
CARY: Well , do n't let him know it .
NIKKI: Well , is n't he going home ? Not ever ?
CARY: Not ever . Not in his dark glasses anyway .
NIKKI: Ca n't something be done for him ?
CARY: He 'll have to be - reborn .
NIKKI: How 's he going to end ?
CARY: Well , how are you going to end ? How am I going to end ? How is ANYONE going to end ? How 's your picon citron go ?
NIKKI: It goes fine . But does n't ANYTHING make any difference to you ?
CARY: Not now . A long time ago , perhaps , when I was a little boy .
NIKKI: Tell me , where were you little ?
CARY: In Minnesota . On a farm .
NIKKI: Were you happy then , Cary ?
CARY: I think so .
NIKKI: Tell me , what WAS there to be happy about on a farm in Minnesota ?
CARY: Ohhh , thorn-apple trees in blossom . The smell of burning leaves in the fall . The sound of horses ' hoofs on the road . Did you ever dig up an Indian mound or uncover a nest of baby field mice ? Or explore old trunks in an attic ? Listen to the moaning of the telephone wires in the winter wind ? See a gypsy caravan ?
NIKKI: So THAT 'S why you were happy . On account of apple blossoms and field mice and telephone wires and gypsy caravans and old trunks and things ?
CARY: That 's right .
NIKKI: But are n't you going back ? Not ever ?
CARY: Would you like another picon citron efore you go ? The rain is lifting .
NIKKI: No . I 'm ready now .
CARY: Oh , poets , painters , philosophers
NIKKI: Cocoanut ?

NIKKI: Oh , tell me about Abélise and Éloard .
CARY: No , Nikki . Not Abélise and Éloard . Héloïse and Abélard .
NIKKI: I 'm sorry . I really did n't do it on purpose . It was on account of the picon citron . Tell me about Héloïse and Abélard .
CARY: Well , they 're buried here in the same sepulchre side by side .
NIKKI: Why are they buried side by side ?
CARY: They were the world 's most famous lovers . There 's the tomb .
NIKKI: Tell me about the world 's most famous lovers .
CARY: Well , Abélard was a scholastic philosopher
NIKKI: Whatever that is .
CARY: Whatever that is . He gained a footing in a certain household as tutor to a maiden called Héloïse . And employed his unlimited opportunities for the purpose of Well , betrayal . Not , however , unmixed with real love . He carried her off to Brittany .
NIKKI: Tell me more .
CARY: Well , her uncle was furious . He lamed Abélard for the whole thing . He conceived a terrible revenge .
NIKKI: I 'm afraid for Abélard .
CARY: He broke into Abélard 's apartment one night and perpetrated upon him the most brutal punishment .
NIKKI: Oh , dear .
CARY: The lovers were forced to live their lives apart . But when they died , they were buried here side by side . There 's a story that little heart- shaped stones are supposed to grow around the tomb .
NIKKI: Heart-shaped stones ?
CARY: And lovers come and find them and exchange them with each other . And , so long as you keep the stone from the tomb of Héloïse and Abélard , no harm can come to your true love .
NIKKI: How perfectly beautiful .
CARY: Is n't that a quaint legend ?
NIKKI: Do you think I might find a heart- shaped stone ? You help me , Cary .
CARY: All right , Nikki . Only we have to leave soon . They close up the place .
NIKKI: Just as soon as we find our stones .
CARY: That 's right , Nikki .
NIKKI: And , now , no harm can come to ou true love .
CARY: And , now , we 'll have to go .
NIKKI: You were so nice to let me come with you . I spoiled your whole day . You were going to do something else , were n't you ?
CARY: Does n't matter .
NIKKI: Well , what was it , Cary ? Why did you come here today ?
CARY: To pay my respects to an old comrade .
NIKKI: Oh . And you wanted to be alone . I 'm sorry . Oh , I 'm so sorry . Do n't pay any attention to me , Cary . I ca n't help it . You MAKE me cry .

UNCAS: We had our say , Ian .
SERGEANT MAJOR: Prime ! Load !
LIEUTENANT: They will report or be pressed into service !
JACK: Does that mean they will be granted leave to defend their homes if the settlements are attacked ?
WEBB: Of course .
JACK: You got yourself a colonial militia , General .
HEYWARD: Major Duncan Heyward reporting , Sir ! Webb 's pouring gin .
WEBB: Duncan . How was your journey ?
WEBB: And what is that ?
HEYWARD: The Crown `` negotiating '' the terms of service ?
WEBB: I know . One has to give Americans `` reasons '' and make agreements to get them to do anything at all . Tiring , is n't it ? But that 's the way of it here .
HEYWARD: I thought British policy is 'Make the World England ' , sir . A chill . Majors do n't upbraid Generals .
WEBB: You will take command of the 62nd Regiment of Foot . At Fort William Henry under Colonel Munro . I will march the 33rd to Fort Edward .
WEBB: Yes . You may . You there . What does Munro call you ?
HEYWARD: By your leave , sir . Webb holds Heyward a moment
HEYWARD: Dawn . At the encampment . Six a.m. sharp . See to it you 're there .
CORA: Heyward ! Duncan Heyward .
HEYWARD: My God it 's good to see you .
HEYWARD: And by sea !
CORA: You still have an aversion to the water ?
HEYWARD: Aversion ? No . `` Hatred '' `` Loathing '' Cora laughs .
CORA: Some say that 's the way of it .
HEYWARD: `` Some '' ?
CORA: Cousin Eugenie , my father , but
HEYWARD: Cora , in my heart , I know once we 're joined , we 'll be the happiest couple in England . Let those whom you trust , your father , help settle what 's best for you . In view of you indecision , why not rely on their advice and judgment as well as mine ?
CORA: Yes . Yes , I will . She 's still unsettled .
ALICE: Duncan !
HEYWARD: My God , you 've grown up .
ALICE: We leave in the morning ? !
HEYWARD: Yes , miss .
ALICE: I wo n't sleep tonight . What an adventure ! I absolutely can not wait to return to Portman
CORA: My God , Alice .
HEYWARD: It can be dangerous
ALICE: Nonsense . Papa would n't have sent for us if it were dangerous .
AMBROSE: Atten-shun !
CORA: Alice , did you see that ?
CORA: Alice ? Alice rouses from fatigue .
HEYWARD: Are you alright ?
ALICE: Can we rest soon ?
HEYWARD: Absolutely .
MAGUA: I understand . This is not good place to stop . Two leagues from here . No water 'til then . That where we stop . Better place .
HEYWARD: No . Stop in the glade just ahead ! When the ladies are rested , we will proceed . Do you understand ?
HEYWARD: Excuse me . What did you say ?
MAGUA: Magua say `` Yes . Good idea . '' As they begin to stop
CORA: No , Duncan ! Duncan ignores her .
ALICE: Stop it ! Heyward spins .
ALICE: We need them to get out of here !
HEYWARD: We were headed
HAWKEYE: Fort William Henry .
HAWKEYE: take you as far as the fort .
HAWKEYE: Day and a half Where did you get the guide ?
HEYWARD: Colonel Munro sent him . He was one of ou Mohawk allies .
HAWKEYE: He is Huron and nothing else . Why would he want to murder the girl ?
HEYWARD: What ? !
HAWKEYE: Dark haired
HEYWARD: Miss Cora Munro . He never set eyes on her before today .
HAWKEYE: No blood vengeance ? No re-proach or insult ?
HEYWARD: Of course not ! And how is it you were nearby ?
HAWKEYE: Came across the war party , tracked 'em .
HEYWARD: Then you 're assigned to Fort William Henry ?
HAWKEYE: No .
HEYWARD: Fort Edward , then ?
HAWKEYE: No . Headin ' west . To Can-tuck-ee .
HEYWARD: I thought all our colonial scouts were in the militia ? Off to the side , Uncas smiles at the idea .
HAWKEYE: I ai n't your `` scout '' . And I am in no damn militia .
HEYWARD: Then you are one of those who would allow England to fight alone while she protects you from France ?
HAWKEYE: England does not protect me and does not war against France on our account . She uses
HAWKEYE: Clear it up any ?
HEYWARD: I owe you gratitude or I 'd call you out !
HAWKEYE: Do not let gratitude get in the way
CHINGACHGOOK: Yengeese no good in woods . Make more noise , I kill him .
HEYWARD: Anything to be done ?
HEYWARD: Who were these people ?
HAWKEYE: Ottawa !
HEYWARD: Excuse me
CHINGACHGOOK: Ottawa .
HAWKEYE: Movin ' fast , not able to carry much this was a war party ?
HEYWARD: Let us look after them He starts approaching the bodies .
CHINGACHGOOK: Leave them .
CORA: Though they are strangers , they are at least entitled to a Christian burial !
HAWKEYE: Let us go , miss .
CORA: I will not . I have seen the face of wa efore , Mr. Poe , but never war made on women and children . And almost as cruel is your indifference .
HAWKEYE: Miss Munro . They are not strangers . And they stay as they lay !
CORA: Why did n't you bury those people ?
HAWKEYE: Anyone lookin ' to pick up our trail , would see it as a sign of our passing
CORA: You knew them . Hawkeye looks at her and nods .
HAWKEYE: Well that is to be expected . My father
CORA: Your `` father '' ?
HAWKEYE: Chingachgook . He warned me about people like you .
CORA: He did ?
HAWKEYE: Yes . He said `` do not try to make them understand you . ''
CORA: What ? !
HAWKEYE: Yes . And `` do not try to understand them . That is because they are a breed apart and they make no sense `` Cora 's indignation is cut off because
CORA: Why did they turn back ?
HAWKEYE: In your particular case , miss , I would make some allowance
CORA: Thank you so much .
HAWKEYE: They buried my ma & pa and my sisters . And Chingachgook - who found me with two French trappers - raised me up as his own .
CORA: I 'm sorry .
HAWKEYE: I do not remember them . I was one or two .
CORA: How did you learn English ?
HAWKEYE: My father sent Uncas & I to Reverend Wheelock 's school when I was ten . So we would know both worlds though we were told only bother learning readin ' & arithmetic from yous .
CORA: And what were the consequentialities of European culture you did n't bother with ?
HAWKEYE: The Bible . Monarchy . Many wrong ideas about the government of men . My father 's people already know each man is his own nation . And only he can have dominion over himself . Not kings . No man is bette than any other man .
CORA: In London those radical ideas could land you in Newgate prison . Why were those people living in this defenseless place ?
HAWKEYE: 'Cos frontier land 's the only land affordable to poor people . So after seven years indentured service in Virginia , they headed out here where they are beholden to none and not livin ' by another 's leave Their name was Cameron . John & Alexandria .
CORA: You are right , Mr. Poe . We do not understand what is happening here . And it is not as I imagined it would be , thinking of it in Boston and London
HAWKEYE: Sorry to disappoint you
HAWKEYE: Top of this ridge . Fort and Lake George are downhill of it .
CORA: Thunder Papa will arrange something .
HEYWARD: The men of the regiment will fetch water from
ALICE: Duncan , you are absolutely gallant . If Cora does n't marry you , I shall .
CORA: Alice !
ALICE: I ca n't wait to see Papa
CORA: And you , Duncan ? What are you looking forward to ?
HEYWARD: Posting to a different continent . He and Alice laugh . Cora does not .
CORA: I think it 's very important and exciting . Heyward looks at her . She 's not kidding .
HEYWARD: I 'm Major Duncan Heyward !
BEAMS: Captain Jeffrey Beams . We did n't think you 'd make it through !
HEYWARD: Where 's Colonel Munro ? His daughters are here , too .
AD LIBS: Uncas ! Nathaniel
IAN: Thought you and Nathaniel were n't joinin'-up .
UNCAS: Did n't !
HAWKEYE: Dropped in to see how you boys is doin ' .
ALICE: Papa , Papa ! !
MUNRO: Why are you here ? !
CORA: When ? How ?
MUNRO: My letter
CORA: There was none !
MUNRO: What ?
CORA: There was no letter .
MUNRO: I sent three men to Webb !
HEYWARD: One called Magua arrived .
CORA: He delivered no such message . Munro 's stunned .
MUNRO: Does Webb not even know we are besieged ?
HEYWARD: Sir . Webb has no idea . And he certainly does not know to send reinforcements !
MUNRO: What happened to you ?
HEYWARD: Ambush on the George Road . This Magua led us into it . eighteen killed . It 's these men who saved us . They guided us here
MUNRO: Thank you . How can I reward you ? No answer . Then
HAWKEYE: Help ourselves to a few horns from you powder stores .
MUNRO: What else ?
UNCAS: Some food .
PHELPS: Miss Cora ! How are you ?
CORA: Fine , Mr. Phelps . Have you cat gut and a suturing needle ? And we could use some rum , clothes , and a place to wash
MUNRO: Logistics are his guns are bigger than mine and he has more of them . They keep our heads down while his sappers make thirty yards of
HEYWARD: They look to be three hundred yards out . You have three days .
MUNRO: Bloody murderers .
HAWKEYE: A man , here , can make a run straight through to Webb .
MUNRO: not enough time to get to Albany and back with reinforcements
HEYWARD: Webb 's not in Albany . He marched the 33rd to Fort Edward two days ago .
MUNRO: Webb 's at Edward ?
HEYWARD: Yes , sir .
MUNRO: Only twelve miles away ! He could be here day after tomorrow .
HAWKEYE: John Cameron 's cabin . We come upon it last night . Burned out . Everyone murdered . And it was Ottawa . They 're allied to the French . Munro looks at him .
MUNRO: Yes , Mr. Poe ? So ?
HAWKEYE: It was a war party . It means they 're on the attack up and down the frontier .
MUNRO: Thank you . Hawkeye 's dismissed , frozen out .
HAWKEYE: Many men here , their homes are in the path .
MUNRO: That 's all , sir .
HEYWARD: Things were done . Nobody was spared
MUNRO: Terrible feature of war in the Americas . Best to keep your sight fixed on our duty . Our duty is to defeat France . That hangs on a courier to Webb .
MONTCALM: For my children and the children of the true
MAGUA: English war chief , Webb goes to Fort Edward with 33rd Regiment . He does not know my father 's army attacks Fort William Henry .
BOUGAINVILLE: But by now Munro knows his couriers did n't get through . He 'll send another .
MAGUA: The Grey Hair will try .
BOUGAINVILLE: Four or five , including two women entered the fort
MAGUA: The Grey Hair 's children were under Magua 's knife but escaped . They 'll be under it again .
MONTCALM: Why do hate the Grey Hair , Magua ?
MAGUA: When the Grey Hair is dead , Magua will eat his heart . Before he dies Magua will put his
PHELPS: First assisted me in Austria when she was fourteen . I would say she does
HAWKEYE: She does not shy away from much
PHELPS: What 's that ?
HAWKEYE: Nothin ' .
CORA: Mr Poe ?
HAWKEYE: Miss . May I ?
CORA: What are you looking at , Mr. Poe ?
HAWKEYE: Why , I am looking at you , Miss .
UNCAS: You told him about the raid ?
HAWKEYE: He does not want to hear it . But he is gon na have to .
JACK: Get together by the West Battery James & Ian , Sharitarish & William .
UNCAS: Tight weave .
HAWKEYE: Another forty yards ?
HEYWARD: Sergeant ! Form three ranks !
SERGEANT MAJOR: Sir ! Upon the center , wheel to the left-about ! March ! Rear ranks , proper distance ! Front ranks , take your distance ! March ! Halt ! Make ready !
SERGEANT MAJOR: First rank ! Second rank ! Present arms !
HEYWARD: Fire ! ! !
SERGEANT MAJOR: Sir ! ! ! Third rank ! Twelve paces ! Forward march !
HEYWARD: Fire ! ! !
HEYWARD: Sergeant Major !
SERGEANT MAJOR: Sir !
HEYWARD: Thank you , Sergeant Major . Thank the men .
SERGEANT MAJOR: Atten-hut !
HEYWARD: Cora I wanted to talk to you , but I 'll come back another time
CORA: Alice
ALICE: Talk to Duncan , Cora I must manage I can not be an invalid schoolgirl . I 'll see if Mr. Phelps needs anything She leaves .
HEYWARD: I 'm sorry , I did n't mean to
CORA: Her nerves are shattered . She 's trying to be brave .
HEYWARD: Cora , I adore you and , when we come together , we will be the happiest couple in England I am certain of that . More than ever before .
CORA: Duncan Duncan , I promised you an answer . You have complimented me with your persistence and patience But the decision I 've come to is I 'd rather make the gravest of mistakes than surrender my own judgment . Heyward is stunned .
HEYWARD: I see
CORA: I am sorry , Duncan
MUNRO: I must receive proof more conclusive than Mr. Poe 's opinion before I weaken ou defenses by allowing militia to withdraw .
JACK: Chingachgook 's of the same opinion . Taken
HAWKEYE: That judgment is not more important than thei ight under agreement with Webb to defend thei
MUNRO: What did you see , Major ?
HAWKEYE: You 're a liar !
HAWKEYE: And the blood is on your hands ! Heyward reaches for his sword .
MUNRO: I 'll have none of that ! Montcalm is a soldier and a gentleman . Not a butcher .
HAWKEYE: Easy for you to suppose . While it is thei women and children , not yours , alone in their farms !
MUNRO: You forget yourself !
JACK: We are not forgettin ' Webb 's promise !
MUNRO: British promises are honored . And the militia will not be released . Because I need more definite proof than this man 's word !
JACK: Nathaniel 's word been good on the frontier a long time before you got here !
MUNRO: This interview 's over ! The militia stays !
HAWKEYE: And if English law can not be trusted , maybe these people would do better makin ' a peace with the French !
HEYWARD: That is sedition ! Treason !
HAWKEYE: That is the truth !
HEYWARD: I ought to have you whipped from this fort !
HAWKEYE: Major ! Some day I think you and I are gon na have a serious disagreement .
MUNRO: Anyone fomenting or advocating leaving Fort William Henry will be hung for sedition . Anyone leaving will be shot for desertion . My decision is final . Get out .
HAWKEYE: got no kin in the settlements . If I did , I 'd be long gone .
IAN: You did n't think it right to be here in the first place .
HAWKEYE: By my light that 's how I saw it then and I see it that way now
IAN: But we are under English military authority .
A COLONIAL: Should 've skinned outta this long ago .
COLONIAL #2: Got no families , Captain . Figured we 'd stay and give 'em a hand even though
HAWKEYE: I 'll cover them from the top of the casement .
JACK: You 're not coming with us ? Hawkeye shakes his head .
HAWKEYE: Got a reason to stay .
JACK: That reason wear a blue dress and work in the surgery ? Low laughte
HAWKEYE: It does and it is a better lookin ' reason than you , Jack Winthrop . Push hard , 'cos you got to clear the French outpost by dawn . Good luck , Jack . The men split up
SERGEANT: As you were ! !
CHINGACHGOOK: Why do they make my son prisoner ?
HAWKEYE: I helped Winthrop and the others leave This fight is not yours , father . I love you and my brother . And you should leave this place now and go to Can-tuck-ee
CHINGACHGOOK: What will they do with my white son ?
GUARD: Get back from him !
CORA: He saved us ! We are alive only because of him
MUNRO: The man encouraged the colonials to desert in this very room , in my presence . He is
CORA: He knew the consequences . And he stayed . Are those the actions of a criminal ? Duncan , do something .
HEYWARD: He knew the penalty for breaking regulations . He ought to pay without sending you to beg .
CORA: You know he would n't send me ! You misrepresented what you saw and caused this .
MUNRO: Not with enough certainty to outweigh British interests in this fort .
HEYWARD: And who empowered these provincials to pass judgment upon England 's policies in her own colonies ? To come and go without so much as a `` by your leave . ''
CORA: They do not live their lives `` by your leave . '' They hack it out of the wilderness with their own two hands , burying their dead and their children along the way .
HEYWARD: You are defending him because you 've become infatuated with him .
CORA: Duncan , you are a man with a few admirable qualities . But taken as a whole , I was wrong to have thought so highly of you . Heyward 's shot through the heart .
MUNRO: But the man is guilty of sedition and subject to military justice and beyond pardon .
CORA: `` Justice '' ? If that 's `` justice '' , then the sooner French guns blow the English army out of America , the better it will be fo these people .
MUNRO: You do not know what you are saying !
CORA: Yes I do ! I know exactly what I am saying . And if it is sedition , then I am guilty of sedition , too ! She exits , leaving them there .
HAWKEYE: Sorry ca n't ask you in . Cora 's pale smile .
CORA: They 're going to hang you . Why did n't you leave when you had the chance ?
HAWKEYE: Because what I am interested in is right here
CORA: What would you have me do ? He touches her hand .
HAWKEYE: Webb 's reinforcements will arrive or not . If they do not arrive , the fort will fall . If that happens , stay close to your father . The French will protect the officer class among the English .
CORA: No . I will find you .
HAWKEYE: Do not . Promise me .
CORA: The whole world 's on fire , is n't it ? A pause .
HAWKEYE: This part of it sure is
CORA: What is it ?
HAWKEYE: I do n't know . Whatever happens you stay
MONTCALM: Colonel Munro , I have known you as a gallant antagonist . I am happy to make you acquaintance as a friend .
MUNRO: And I to make yours , Monsieur le Marquis .
MONTCALM: Please accept my compliments for the strong and skillful defense of your fortress . Unde the command of a lesser man it would have
MUNRO: Monsieur le Marquis , I am a soldier , not a
MONTCALM: You have already done everything which is necessary for the honor of your Prince . I
MUNRO: However I may apprise such testimony from Monsieur Montcalm , Fort William Henry is strong and stands .
MONTCALM: Honor that is freely accorded to courage , may e refused obstinacy These hills afford to us every opportunity to reconnoiter you works and I am possibly as well acquainted
MONTCALM: My scouts intercepted this dispatch intended for you . Munro is puzzled , suspicious .
BOUGAINVILLE: `` Colonel Munro - Fort William Henry . I have
HEYWARD: This is the signature of Webb . And I know the temper of our men . Rathe than spend the war in a French prison hulk in Hudson Bay , they 'd fight to the end .
MUNRO: You have heard your answer , Monsieur le Marquis . Munro starts off . Montcalm stops him .
MONTCALM: Sir . I am incapable of mistreating brave men . I beg you not to sign the death warrant of so many until you have listened to my terms . Munro turns .
MUNRO: Such as ?
MONTCALM: My master requires the fort be destroyed . But , for you and your comrades , there is no privilege that will be denied . None of your men will see the inside of a prison arge . They 're free to go so long as they eturn to England and fight no more on this continent , and the civilian militia return to their farms .
MUNRO: Their arms ?
MONTCALM: They may leave the fortress fully armed , but with no ammunition Other than that , ask what you wish . Munro 's impressed with Montcalm 's generosity .
MUNRO: The honors of war ?
MONTCALM: Granted .
MUNRO: My colors ?
MUNRO: Allow me to consult with my officers .
HEYWARD: General Webb can burn in hell . We 'll go back and dig our graves behind the ramparts ! Ou mission is to fight .
MUNRO: Death and honor are sometimes thought to be
HEYWARD: Sir !
MUNRO: The decision is final .
MONTCALM: Granted , Monsieur .
SENTRY: Qui vive ?
MONTCALM: France .
SENTRY: Le mot d'ordre ?
MONTCALM: La victoire .
SENTRY: C'est bien , vous vous promenez bien matin , monsieur !
MAGUA: Is the hatchet buried between the English and my French father ?
MONTCALM: Yes .
MAGUA: Not a warrior has a scalp and the white men ecome friends .
MONTCALM: My master owns these lands and your fathe has been ordered to drive off the English squatters . They have consented to go . So now he calls them enemies no longer .
MONTCALM: But so many suns have set since Le Renard struck the war post . Is he not tired ?
MAGUA: Does my father know that ?
MONTCALM: That 's where a lead bullet has torn you .
MAGUA: And this ?
MONTCALM: My son has been sadly injured . Who did this ?
MAGUA: Magua slept hard in the English wigwams . And the sticks left their mark Magua 's village and lodges were burnt . Magua 's children were killed by the English . Magua was taken as a slave by the Mohawks who fought for the Grey Hair . Magua 's wife elieved he was dead and became the wife of another . The Grey Hair was the father of all this . In time Magua became blood-brother to Mohawk
MONTCALM: My son Magua 's pain is my pain .
MAGUA: Does the chief of the Canadas believe the English will keep the terms ?
MONTCALM: Munro would . But General Webb will not send their soldiers across the salt lake . Having let them go , I fear I will only fight the same men again when I move south . And yet , I can not break the terms of the
MAGUA: Many things my French father can not do , Magua can .
MONTCALM: As the English march away , our soldiers and the Canadiens will be drawn to the looting of the fort except for a small guard Magua abruptly leaves Montcalm .
MAGUA: I wonder at the blindness and pride of the white man . He believes only he knows how to speak falsely to make other men do his bidding . Magua exhales in derision .
MUNRO: Monsieur , the fort is yours .
MUNRO: Steady ! No one fires !
SERGEANT MAJOR: Yes sir ! Drums beat the cadence .
HEYWARD: Fire !
SERGEANT MAJOR: Prime ! Load ! Second rank six paces forward ! Present ! Hurons are twenty yards away and closing .
HEYWARD: Fire !
MAGUA: Grey Hair . I will cut your heart from you
HEYWARD: Six paces back ! Prime ! Load ! Rank two , present ! Rank two , hold !
HEYWARD: Rank two , six paces back ! Rank one , present !
CORA: No !
CORA: Stop it ! !
HEYWARD: When you fall into British hands again , Nathaniel Poe , I will have you hanged .
REDCOAT #1: Ca n't keep it up
HAWKEYE: Pull !
HEYWARD: How long ?
HAWKEYE: Only chance we got is to get more distance on 'em and go to ground !
HAWKEYE: Pull ! More Huron musket balls hit water nearby .
REDCOAT #2: Spent .
HAWKEYE: Head for for the white water .
HEYWARD: Do you hear me , sir ! If you ever fall into British hands What white water ?
HAWKEYE: Here 's where it gets tricky
HAWKEYE: We do n't .
HEYWARD: I do n't understand !
HAWKEYE: This is it , as far as we can go If we 're lucky , they 'll be figurin ' we ca n't have come this way and must 've beached ou canoes and headed cross land . If we 're very lucky , they 'll figure we went ove the falls .
HEYWARD: Then what ?
HAWKEYE: Then we take the south rim down the mountain and it 's 12 miles cross country to Fort Edward .
HEYWARD: And if we 're unlucky ?
HAWKEYE: You will have to forego the pleasure of hangin ' me .
HEYWARD: Any powder ?
HAWKEYE: Maybe
CORA: Our father ? Did you see my father ?
CORA: Say nothing to Alice ! Hawkeye nods .
ALICE: Uncas
CORA: Yes . Go ahead .
HEYWARD: What the bloody hell plan is this ?
HAWKEYE: In this there is a chance . If I live , I can try to free you . If we do n't go , there is no powder , there 's too many of them . Though my heart would keep me here , in that there is no chance . None . I can do nothing . Do you understand ?
CORA: Yes . I want you to go .
HEYWARD: Coward ! Coward back at the fort . Coward here . Hawkeye uses discipline not to kill the man .
CORA: You try . With all you have . To save yourself . If the worst happens , and only one of us survives , something of the other does , too
HAWKEYE: If they do n't kill you , they may take you north up into Canada . A warrior may take you for a wife .
HAWKEYE: Listen . Submit . You hear me ? You 're strong . You stay alive . I will find you no matter how far , how long it takes
CORA: never doubt what you are doing .
MAGUA: Gifts ?
HEYWARD: Three , four oxen much wampum .
MAGUA: Wampum ?
HEYWARD: Yes .
MAGUA: Does Yengeese Major have property across salt sea ?
HEYWARD: Yes .
MAGUA: Yengeese Major give all property to Magua . Magua give Yengeese Major much wampum , many gifts , maybe three , four oxen .
HEYWARD: Gold could be arranged .
MAGUA: For Munro children ?
HEYWARD: Yes .
MAGUA: How much gold has the master of the Yengeese ?
HEYWARD: The King ? The King has mountains of gold !
MAGUA: Not enough .
HEYWARD: What is enough ?
MAGUA: Heart . Give Magua new heart .
SACHEM: The tomahawks of your young men have een very red .
MAGUA: Many of the Yengeese are dead , great Sachem . I have brought three of my prisoners , to honor you . Two are the children of Munro . Whose scalp hangs on my lodge pole . And whose heart I cut from his chest .
MAGUA: the earth was pale . Our tomahawks were bright . Now they are dull from war . And the Huron rich with the trophies of honor Magua will sell the English officer to Les Francais and the reward is my gift to you , wise one The women - children of the white war chief - will burn in our fires so all can share in this .
HAWKEYE: Translate for me , Major . Into French . Every word as I say it .
MAGUA: Our father , Montcalm , is greater than the Yengeese in the arts of war . The Huron do not fear English anger .
HAWKEYE: Wise one , the French fathers made peace and swore to their honor not to break the friendship . Magua broke it . It is false that the French would not be friends , still , to the Huron . Sachem reacts .
MAGUA: It made our French father happy to neve have to fight the same Yengeese again . He told me this without telling me this . Hawkeye realizes this is true .
HAWKEYE: So the Huron are the servants of the French ? To do what the French are shamed to do ?
MAGUA: No . Huron serve no one . The French fathe elieves he fooled Magua because he is so proud of his cleverness , he is blind . But it is the Huron path that Magua walks down , not the French one Now , Les Francais , also , fear Huron . That is good . When the Huron is strong from their fear , we will make the terms of trade with Les Francais . And we will trade as the white man trades . Take land from the Abnakes ; fur from the Osage , Sauk & Fox . And make the Huron great . Ove
HAWKEYE: Magua would use the ways of Les Francais and the Yengeese
MAGUA: The red man put down the bow , picked up the fire stick and became the best warrio in the forest . Yes . It is the only way .
HAWKEYE: Would the Huron make his Algonquin brothers
SACHEM: The white man comes like a day that has passed . And night enters our future with him Our council talks since I was a boy What is the Huron to do ? But Magua would lead Huron down paths that make us not Hurons . Dark girl burn in fire to heal the twisted heart of Magua .
HAWKEYE: No ! listen .
MAGUA: This is not the voice of wisdom . I go to the Hurons of the Lakes ! You are women . Send your arrows and guns to the Seneca , eg from them venison to eat , corn to grind .
HAWKEYE: I said to trade me !
HEYWARD: compliments , Mr. Poe . Take her and get out .
CORA: What are they doing to Duncan ? Duncan !
HAWKEYE: And my compliments to you
CORA: Alice ?
CHINGACHGOOK: UNCAS ! ! !
CHINGACHGOOK: Great Spirit and the Maker of all Life
CHINGACHGOOK/: HAWKEYE a warrior goes to you swift and straight as an arrow shot into the sun . Welcome him
HAWKEYE: Will you go back to England ?
CORA: I have nothing to go back for . Long pause .
HAWKEYE: Then will you stay in America ? She turns to face him .
CORA: Yes .
HAWKEYE: Winter with the Delaware , my father 's cousins . And in the spring , cross the Ohio and look for land to settle with my father in a new place called Can-tuck-ee .
CHINGACHGOOK: The frontier moves with the sun and pushes
HAWKEYE: That 's my father 's sadness talking . Hawkeye puts a hand on his shoulder .
HAWKEYE: What is that ?
CHINGACHGOOK: Will there be anything left to show the world that we ever did exist ?
WINCHESTER REP: Ladies and Gentlemen the Wincheste
ALGREN: My thanks , Mr. McCabe Ladies and Gents .
DAVEY: They 're coming , Nate .
ALGREN: Keep your head down .
ALGREN: What 'd he know ? You watch me now . Do whatever I say . .
DAVEY: Aye-a ye , lieutenant .

KATSUMOTO: He is my blood . I serve him with my life .
ALGREN: By fighting his army ? Katsumoto looks at A1gren .
KATSUMOTO: I do not fight the emperor . I fight those who

ALGREN: I 'm not much of a writer .
ALGREN: Did you love her husband as your own son ?
ALGREN: The difference is , you feel nothing .
KA TSUMOTO: Before you were a soldier , you were a farmer .
ALGREN: What does that have to do with anything ?

ALGREN: The wealthy families .
ALGREN: And you will tell the emperor to stop them ?
KATSUMOTO: I do not tell the emperor what to do .
ALGREN: Then what do you hope to accomplish ?
KATSUMOTO: Will you return to America ?
ALGREN: I have a job here .
KATSUMOTO: You should return to your home .
ALGREN: Why ?

ALGREN: Thank you .
OMURA: You fought bravely on behalf of our army against the rebel Katsumoto .
OMURA: Tell me about your role in Katsumoto 's plans .
ALGREN: I have none .
OMURA: And your sympathies ?
ALGREN: Again , I have none .
ALGREN: He is . unsympathetic . Omura smiles .
OMURA: I thought it was we who are inscrutable . Now it is Algren who smiles .
ALGREN: Again , you flatter me .
ALGREN: Then I will consider it .
OMURA: And I will be grateful .
ALGREN: Private cabin .
GRAHAM: Leave ? Wh y would you leave now ? No white man has ever been in your position . Do you have any idea what it will mean to have Omura
GRAHAM: My God , it 's the edicts
ALGREN: What edicts ?
GRAHAM: Do n't be stupid .
KATSUMOTO: Captain , I had not thought to see you again .
KATSUMOTO: You mean the Gatling Guns and the howitzers , is that how you sa y it ?
ALGREN: They 're about to close a trade agreement that will bring this country more weapons than you can imagine .
KATSUMOTO: Yes , if the emperor agrees - but Omura knows
ALGREN: And you are to be the cause
ALGREN: I know .
KATSUMOTO: The second banned the wearing of sword .
ALGREN: If you do this , they will kill you .
KA TSUMOTO: I am hard to kill .
ALGREN: You do n't know what their weapons can do . All your men butchered Just for pride .
KATSUMOTO: Not for pride . For the emperor .
KATSUMOTO: He has not signed it yet . He holds out Katsumoto 's two samurai swords .
ALGREN: Is it worth it ? just for these ,
KATSUMOTO: I can not live without my soul Can you ? They regard each other .
OMURA: Minister Katsumoto , you honor us .
KATSUMOTO: I read ever y edict with singular attention .
KATSUMOTO: A future with no honor ,
KATSUMOTO: And lining your own pockets in the process .
OMURA: Minister Katsumoto , I must invite you to
ALGREN: I have a fear of sentimental Englishmen .
GRAHAM: You sod . Christ , give us . . second here
ALGREN: Who are they ?
GRAHAM: Ronin would be m y guess . Disgraced samurai doing odd jobs for his Nibs .
ALGREN: What do they want from me ?
GRAHAM: To make sure you 're on the side of God and
GRAHAM: Look who 's getting sentimental now .
ALGREN: Take back to quarters . I walk . And Algren starts back into the city .
ALGREN: Thought I would follow the Japanese fashion .
BAGLEY: Heard you were leaving , actually ?
BAGLEY: Certainly seems obsessed by you . Why do you think that is ?
OMURA: Gentlemen
OMURA: Champagne ? And cigars , of course .
BAGLEY: A gift from President Grant ?
OMURA: Queen Victoria .
ALGREN: Mr. Omura , may I use the necessit y ?
OMURA: Certainly .
ALGREN: This wa y
KATSUMOTO: The ending is proving difficult .
OMURA: What has become of Captain Algren ?
KATSUMOTO: Who is this ?
ALGREN: Name 's Simon Graham . Wants to write a book about you .
KATSUMOTO: Not a book . A play !
ALGREN: Come on .
YORITOMO: You go , Algren-san . I will stop them .
ALGREN: No
YORITOMO: Please .
ALGREN: No . Wait !
KA TSUMOTO: This was your plan ?
ALGREN: Do you have a better one ?
AMBASSADOR SWANBECK: What do you mean ?
BAGLEY: What if he just goes off to the mountains and ecomes a damn sheep-herder or some such ?
AMBASSADOR SWANBECK: You trust a lot in destiny .
KATSUMOTO: I was prepared to die in Omura 's castle . And yet here I am . I can not help but ask why were you sent into my life . What is the lesson you were meant to give me ?
ALGREN: Maybe that neither of us is as smart as we thought
KATSUMOTO: Youai n't whistlin ' Dixie
TAKA: Thank you , Algren-San .
HIGEN: Will you fight the white men ?
ALGREN: If they come here , yes .
HIGEN: Why ?
ALGREN: Higen .
ALGREN: That is what he believed .
HIGEN: I would be afraid to die in battle .
ALGREN: So would I .
HIGEN: But you have been in many battles .
ALGREN: And I was always afraid .
HIGEN: I do n't want you to go .
KATSUMOTO: Algren-san . Algren turns .
KATSUMOTO: That is not possible . As Omura knows .
BAGLEY: Captain Algren , we will show no quarter . You
ALGREN: I take that as a compliment , Colonel . I 'll look for you on the field .
KATSUMOTO: How many ?
ALGREN: About a dozen .
ALGREN: By dying ?
KATSUMOTO: Perhaps .
ALGREN: At least make it battle , not a suicide .
KATSUMOTO: And what would that accomplish ?
ALGREN: It might give you one more day One more fine day like this .
GRAHAM: What is it ? .
ALGREN: The kenbu , .. his dance of death . Taka comes to them .
TAKA: Algren-san , will you come with me ?
KATSUMOTO: So m y hair will have a pleasing scent when I
KATSUMOTO: Do you really think we can defeat them ?
ALGREN: I sure as hell want to find out .
KATSUMOTO: You believe a man can change his destiny ?
KATSUMOTO: `` I belong to the warrior in whom the old ways have joined the new . '' Algren is moved beyond words . He bows .
TAKA: Return .
ALGREN: If that is my destiny Anshinritsumai .
TAKA: Anshinritsumai .
ALGREN: Mr. Graham .

GRAHAM: I will .
ALGREN: The call to advance .
ALGREN: Dead to the last man . Katsumoto glances to him , smiles .
HAGLEY: What the hell ?
OMURA: It seems Katsumoto will resist his destiny . Send in the second wave . Two divisions .
KATSUMOTO: How long ?
KATSUMOTO: Not my world anymore .
BAGLEY: A classic `` V '' ambush . Sonofabitcb is using Welt Point tactics . In the midst of the battle
KATSUMOTO: He was Kaishaku my trusted friend .
ALGREN: We wo n't be able to hold them back this time .
ALGREN: I died a long time ago .
KATSUMOTO: But now you live again .
ALGREN: Yes .
KATSUMOTO: It was not your time .
BAGLEY: The gatling guns . Quickly .

KA TSUMOTO: Are you ready ?
ALGREN: No , Kaishaku .
KATSUMOTO: We will ride together again .
OMURA: Highness , if we could just conclude the matte at hand
AMBASSADOR SWANDECK: Sir , if I may
AMBASSADOR SWANBECK: This is an outrage
OMURA: Enlightened One , we should discuss this
EMPEROR: Omura , do you know our northern island ? Omura is confused .
OMURA: Sir ?
OMURA: Enlightened One
EMPEROR: You have served your function . I have no more
OMURA: Honored Emperor , I do not know wh y you disgrace me . The Emperor finally looks up from the sword .
ALGREN: I will tell you how he lived . We slowl y fade as Algren begins to speak
SOFYA: Why are we slowing down ? No one responds . Slower . Slower .
SASHA: I do n't know , mother . No idea .
SOFYA: Excuse me , why has the train stopped ?
CONDUCTOR: It 's the crowd , ma 'm , the people . They 're blocking the track . In the distance we can here voices .
SOFYA: But if they block the track , the train ca n't goYOU HAVE TO MAKE
TOLSTOY: I have seen your banner . And I´ve heard what you say . You think I´m the hope of Russia , do you ? Well , that´s not true . You are the hope of Russia . The hope of all the world . You say , you want a new way to live ? Well , you are not gon na find it making a fuss ove me . So , I suggest that you get on with your work and let a poor old men get on with his .
VALENTIN: Do you know who that is ? That is the greatest man in the world . The train pulls away into the distance .
SOFYA: Darling .
CHERTKOV: But sex You are twenty three . Not an easy age for abstinence , is it ?
VALENTIN: Tolstoy does not approve of sexual relations . I know this .
CHERTKOV: He despises them , in fact
VALENTIN: This would not be a problem . I 'm celibate . I 'm also a strict vegetarian .
CHERTKOV: Yes , I 've heard many good things about you . I 've even read what you ` ve written . So has he .
VALENTIN: Believe me , since becoming a Tolstoyan , I have become so eage to learn , so comitted to discussing ideas , improving my very soul .
CHERTKOV: Well , we have a lot to do if we are to get his work to the people .
VALENTIN: We ? They both laugh .
CHERTKOV: Yes , we . If we can encourage the spread of passive esistancejust think of it Valentin thousands of ordinary Russians casting off centuries of spiritual and political oppression-
VALENTIN: In the name of truth and freedom .
CHERTKOV: Truth and freedom , yes but still , my boy , there are so many enemies-
VALENTIN: Enemies ?
CHERTKOV: The Czar 's policeYou 'll be followed when you leave hereand the church will stop at nothing to bring him back into the fold . His children ca n't be trusted only Sasha and then of course there is the Countess Well , one does n't like to come etween married people whateve the circumstances , but her dogged attachment to private property , her public criticism of ou movement
CHERTKOV: And although they 've allowed me to return to Russia , I ca n't see him . They keep me under house arrest They might as well keep me in a cage .
VALENTIN: She would n't open his private correspondence
CHERTKOV: I have another task for you , my dear .
VALENTIN: Please .
CHERTKOV: You 'll keep a diary for me . He hands Valentin a notebook .
VALENTIN: Anything ?
CHERTKOV: She 's very , very dangerous .
TOLSTOY: Nothing 's working Hand me my other boot , my friend , will you ?
DUSHAN: Let me finish .
TOLSTOY: It does n't matter . If my heart had stopped beating , I 'd still go iding today .
DUSHAN: Your pulse is my esponsibility
SOFYA: This is impossible ! It really is ! These people are parasites ! Look `` Countess Tolstoy has become estranged from her husband . They arely speak . '' She throws the paper on the floor .
TOLSTOY: Peut-etre . You think that 's inaccurate ?
SOFYA: I think it 's none of the world 's usiness .
TOLSTOY: Dushan Petrovich , you 're scribbling again ?
SOFYA: Darling , where are you going ?
TOLSTOY: Riding with Sasha . Do n't expect us for lunch .
SOFYA: Leovochka , why do you insist on dressing like that .
TOLSTOY: What do you mean ?
SOFYA: Like the man who looks after the sheep .
TOLSTOY: It 's not meant to offend you .
SOFYA: But it does offend me , because it offends reason . You 're a Count , for God 's sake .
DUSHAN: He 's forgotten his coat .
JOURNALIST: Count Tolstoy , you 're no doubt distressed by the Czar 's treatment of your secretary Nikolai Gusev ?
TOLSTOY: These people are bandits .
DUSHAN: I said , let him walk .
TOLSTOY: They come into my house and arrest a man whose only crime is to express a view of life sane than that which prevails .
JOURNALIST: So Gusev is innocent ?
TOLSTOY: Of course , I 'm the guilty one . I eject the Orthodox church . I condemn the established order and I make no secret of it . A young peasant shouts from the crowd .
PEASANT: God bless you , Tolstoy . Thank you .
DUSHAN: Let him walk . Let him walk . But you do n't banish these people very much to your creditI wish I had your largeness of spirit .
SASHA: Papa .
TOLSTOY: Sasha !
SASHA: Did you ride this morning ?
SERGEYENKO: Telyatinki was created by Vladimir Grigorevich as a cente for the movement . Just last week we had a visitor from India . We talked to the group about the healing properties of cobra venum .
VALENTIN: Oh , goodness..It 's a beautiful day .
SERGEYENKO: Yes , but we will pay for it .
VALENTIN: I look forward to it .
SERGEYENKO: Yes you 're lucky.We 're all envious .
VALENTIN: Of course .
SERGEYENKO: You understand we must keep the existence of the diary a secret . Valentin smiles .
VALENTIN: Just thatsecrecy does n't seem to me the essence of Tolstoy 's thought .
SERGEYENKO: But you 'll admit , you 're no expert .
VALENTIN: Yes , II 'll see you in the morning .
SERGEYENKO: If we 're spared .
VALENTIN: Come in .
MASHA: I 've brought you a glass of tea .

TOLSTOY: God bless you .
VALENTIN: I 'm sorry . Sometimes I
TOLSTOY: Vladimir Grigorevich has already written about you at length . I need your help badly . The manifesto against the government is hard work . They commit thei idiotic abuses faster than I can catalogue themand the new ook
VALENTIN: He told me about itIt 's very exciting . Tolstoy nods .
TOLSTOY: I 've become convinced that all the world 's religions have a single organizing principle . Can you guess what it is ? Love ! Love ! Simple Now , I want to talk about you . How are you ? How was your journey ? Come , sit down .
VALENTIN: I 'm very happy . You are very kind . I 'm no one and you are you are Leo Tolstoy and you ask me about my work .
TOLSTOY: You rest for a moment and I 'll fetch you a glass of tea . Rest , ecause there 's work for both of us together .
SOFYA: These people have nothing .
DUSHAN: It really is the most extraordinary thing . Absolutely ignoring him .
SOFYA: It 's not for lack of land that the muzhiks live in poverty . They have no will power and they drink too much .
TOLSTOY: I 'm not suggesting they be given land . Private property is the oot of the problem We should e giving ours away .
ANDREY: Give it to whom ?
SOFYA: It 's all ridiculous . You think that poverty makes the peasants somehow morally superior .
TOLSTOY: I believe that wealth corrupts us all , yes I do . A pause . Valentin fills the silence .
VALENTIN: It 's a keystone of the movement .
SOFYA: Oh , I know all about the movement .
TOLSTOY: If the peasants had money , they would n't surround themselves , as we do , with footmen costing ten ubles a month .
SOFYA: No , they 'd spend it on drink and whores .
TOLSTOY: Valentin Fedorovich , do you think fifty years from now , people will eat while grown men walk around and wait on them hand and foot ?
DUSHAN: Oh , that 's goodthat 's good .
VALENTIN: I think
SOFYA: Stop scribbling ! You all think he 's Christ , do n't you ? He thinks he 's Christ . There is an awkward pause .
DUSHAN: I 'm notI do n't believe Leo Nikolayevich is Christ . Christ is Christ but
SOFYA: But what ?
DUSHAN: I believe he 's one of the prophets . God speaks through him . I recognize the cadence in his voice .
SOFYA: This is unbearable . No wonder I feel lonely . I 'm surrounded by morrons .
SASHA: Mama , you 're being ridiculous .
SOFYA: Am I ? I sit here and listen to this talk of love and God and equality , knowing full well that Count Generosity here is fully prepared to give away everything we have .
TOLSTOY: You keep going on like thatWhy do you think we should profit from the work I´m doing which is only meant for the sake of the people .
SOFYA: STOP IT ! STOP WRITING NOW !
DUSHAN: In defense of my gift , let me demonstrate . It 's quite emarkable , really .
VALENTIN: It 's your voice . It 's wonderful .
TOLSTOY: It 's tiresome . Anothe emarkable invention will supercede it .
DUSHAN: Leo Nikolayevich is something of a Luddite , I fear .
TOLSTOY: Oh , that´s better . That´s nice . Very nice indeed .
SASHA: My mother does n't understand my father 's goals , not since his work as a novelist became secondary . His commitment to the spiritual life offends her . They 've fought about it fo years .
VALENTIN: I 'm sure she means well . Sasha just looks at him .
SASHA: Quite . A pause .
VALENTIN: I mean to say , I feel privileged to be here . It 's an honor .
SASHA: God Bless You .
VALENTIN: I 'm sorry . Sometimes I sneeze when I 'm nervous .
SASHA: What is it ?
IVAN: It´s a note , for him . He nods toward Valentin .
SASHA: Well , give it to him then . Valentin reads the note .
VALENTIN: It´s from your mother . She wants to see me . As Valentin goes ,
SASHA: She is looking for allies . Pay attention . This is war .
SOFYA: I see a fine young man before me . Clear eyes . Nice features , rathe handsome in a peculiar way .
VALENTIN: Thank you , Countess
SOFYA: Call me Sofya Andreyevna . We do n't stand on formality here , as you may have observed . Many young men ruin their looks y loose living . You 're a real Tolstoyan , I can tell !
VALENTIN: I admire your husband immensely .
SOFYA: That 's excellent . He likes that .
VALENTIN: His ideas are beautifulsocial justicethe ideaDo n't you think ? Sofya drains her tea cup , signals for more .
SOFYA: He 's very grateful for the help you 've been giving him . He told me so himself . I think it surprises him that a young man would be so diligent . When he was your age , he was whoring in the Caucasus . Valentin 's eyes are wide . She nods .
VALENTIN: Thank you .
SOFYA: You 've read War and Peace ?
VALENTIN: Many times twice . Sofya smiles at his honesty .
SOFYA: When he was writing it , long efore Chertkov created that monstrosity at Telyatinki , before all this `` new religion '' and evolutionary nonsense What do you think of Chertkov , by the way ?
VALENTIN: He 's given me an extraordinary opportunity .
SOFYA: But you see what a fool he is , a self-serving puritanical idiot . I have to say , it 's been extremely pleasant since they 've locked him in his house .
VALENTIN: I do n't believe anyone wants to do that .
SOFYA: I have a little gift for you
VALENTIN: It 's a very popular activity around your husband .
SOFYA: You 're teasing me , but I trust you 'll write the truth .
VALENTIN: That may not be so easy .
SOFYA: Nonsense . You 've been listening to your friends at Telyatinki Write what you see . That 's always the place to begin . What . You . See .
MASHA: You 're finished for the day ?
VALENTIN: He did n't need me this afternoon .
MASHA: No , I find it sweet . I find you eactionary .
VALENTIN: Tolstoy 's kind to everyone .
MASHA: What do you talk about when you 're with him ? Why are you blushing ?
VALENTIN: We talk about me .
MASHA: Really .
VALENTIN: He wants to know everything about me , my parents , my relations with women , my experience of god - He looks up to see Masha smiling at him .
MASHA: And what relations are these ?
VALENTIN: At school ?
MASHA: In the gymnasium , after the girls had gone . There were straw mats on the floor .
VALENTIN: I see
MASHA: Have I upset you ? He looks at her .
VALENTIN: NoI appreciate your frankness
MASHA: But you disapprove of me . I see it in your eyes .
VALENTIN: I do n't . Not at allI think sexual activityhow men and women combine their physical parts is completely neutral .
MASHA: Listen to you . You 're a prig . Just like Sergeyenko . Why else would they have hired you ?
VALENTIN: That 's not fai
MASHA: I do n't care if it 's fair . It 's trueneutralmy God
VALENTIN: I 'm going . He puts down the axe .
MASHA: Do as you like .
VALENTIN: Yes . You know , I think that I never mind .
SASHA: Where 's papa ?
TOLSTOY: I could n't write . I was distracted I thinkI had a dream last night , about a Tarta girl I knew in the war .
VALENTIN: A girl who died ?
TOLSTOY: No , noA girl I had sexual intercourse with Sometimes we did it twice a day . Valentin sneezes .
VALENTIN: You should n't torture yourself . It was a long time ago . Tolstoy laughs out loud .
TOLSTOY: Torture ? You are a virgin , are n't you .
VALENTIN: I try toyou know , to
TOLSTOY: To be what , a good Tolstoyan ? Tolstoy smiles .
VALENTIN: Are you alright ?
TOLSTOY: Kalya , her name wasShe 's an old woman now , white hair , old ody like me . She 'd hardly emember my name , I suspect . She may even be dead . Do you think that meant something ?
VALENTIN: What do you mean ?
TOLSTOY: I mean that little romance . Was there some meaning to it ?
VALENTIN: It´s interesting . I think you would say..I mean , I´ve read where you say that the physical ody isn´t real . That it´s all an illusion .
TOLSTOY: I say lots of things . What do you say ? What do you think ?
VALENTIN: II don´t know . Leo Nikoleyevich smiles .
TOLSTOY: I don´t know , either . He inhales deeply .
VALENTIN: Lilac ?
TOLSTOY: Precisely . It 's lilac . The smell 's stronger when the sun goes down . He presses Valentin 's hand .
SASHA: Papa !
TOLSTOY: I 've enjoyed myself , my boy .
SASHA: He 's free . He 's freeHe 's coming back Smash cut to
TOLSTOY: My dear , dear man .
SOFYA: To give the copyright as `` a gift to humanity . `` the reptile .
ANDREY: Papa 's not in his right mind . He ca n't defend himself against these thieves . My tooth is killing me .
SOFYA: You 're a fine son , darling . None of this make believe chastity and made up religion . I wish all my children had turned out like you .
ANDREY: A man'th responthibility ith to hith family .
SOFYA: Chertkov 's notions of virtuous ehavior are calculated to destroy me .
ANDREY: To dethtroy uth all .
SOFYA: There is nothing more pathetic than impoverished aristocrats . She walks out of the room .
CHERTKOV: Sofya Andreyevna , I 'm happy to see you .
SOFYA: And I 'm happy to make you happyalways .
CHERTKOV: I 'm glad to have a moment alone with you , Valentin . How do you think you 're getting on ?
VALENTIN: I hope my work is pleasing to Leo Nikolayevich .
CHERTKOV: Yes . He seems satisfied and that 's good . The reports I 've eceived from you however There seems to be some confusion .
VALENTIN: What do you mean ?
CHERTKOV: You send me never ending commentary on Tolstoy 's writing . That 's all very interesting but not very useful . I need to know what goes on with Sofya Andreyevna . You must see by now she 's committed to undermining her husband 's best intentions .
VALENTIN: It 's not quite so obvious to me .
CHERTKOV: Because she is duplicitous . You are very bright . Too bright to let her into you . Chertkov fixes the boy with his intense gaze .
VALENTIN: I do .
CHERTKOV: The ideals we share ?
VALENTIN: That 's why I 'm here .
CHERTKOV: Good , of course it is . Do you think the Countess suspects something ?
VALENTIN: Well , I think the Countess is very suspicios by nature .
CHERTKOV: How so ?
VALENTIN: I don´t think she likes you very much .
CHERTKOV: What does she say ?
VALENTIN: It´s a tone I´ve picked up .
CHERTKOV: We simply want to distribute Tolstoy 's work to the widest audience possible . She just has no understanding what it is we are trying to do . There´s nothing in it for any of us but a real chance to increase the world´s happiness . He takes Valentin 's hand .
VALENTIN: Hello Hello ? After a moment , it opens a crack .
MASHA: Ssshh .
VALENITN: What ?
MASHA: Your book .
VALENTIN: Whatwhat is it ?
MASHA: You really are a virgin . Valentin tenses a little .
VALENTIN: Wake up , wake up .
MASHA: I am awake .
VALENTIN: I want to ask you something..Say it again .
MASHA: It was wonderful . They both giggle .
VALENTIN: Why did you come to a place like this ?
MASHA: What do you mean ?
VALENTIN: You don´t follow any of the ules . Masha smiles .
MASHA: You mean , why does someone who does n't follow the rules come to a place like this ?
VALENTIN: What is it ?
SERGEYENKO: Open the door .
VALENTIN: Tell him I 'll be down at once .
DUSHAN: Look at the love in him , like Jesus..suffering the childrenall that
TOLSTOY: An old man is a very ugly thing . Tolstoy sees Valentin , lights up .
MASHA: We 're happy to have you with us .
CHERTKOV: What are you doing ?
TOLSTOY: What do you mean ? He motions to the photographers .
CHERTKOV: You 've killed a living thing .
MASHA: It 's absurd . That 's all .
VALENTIN: What are you saying ?
MASHA: I 'm sorry but- It 's a mosquito .
TOLSTOY: Forgive him . He ca n't help it . He 's a better Tolstoyan than I am .
CHERTKOV: It 's not the message we want to send .
SASHA: From my mother `` Nerves dreadful . Stop . Insomnia . Stop . Pulse 100 . Stop . Please come home .
DUSHAN: From Sofya Andreyevna . `` I beg you . Stop . Unwell . Stop . Hurry ack . ''
SASHA: Who taught her to use that damned machine ?
CHERTKOV: Perhaps Sasha 's right . Encouraging this may not be the est thing .
SASHA: It 's a trick , Papa . She 'll drain you . You 'll be miserable .
TOLSTOY: No , my dear , I 'll go alone .
SOFYA: I 'm finenow that you 're home .
TOLSTOY: It 's no good , you know , all this . You frightened everyone .
SOFYA: Did I really ? I do n't believe it . Not you . I 'm your little ird . You know the sounds I make .
TOLSTOY: That was some sort of love call ?
SOFYA: It brought you back to me . She reaches out her hand to him .
TOLSTOY: Why ? Why ? Why , do you do it ? We live in the country and you insist on making it an opera house . What 's wrong with a little peace now and then ? Sofya laughs .
SOFYA: Look at me . This is who I am . This is what you married . We 're older , maybe we 're old , but I 'm still your little chicken You 're still my big cock . She smiles at him .
TOLSTOY: I do .
SOFIA: I want you to love me .
MASHA: I 'm not supposed to do this either .
VALENTIN: Masha . You are not supposed to smoke at Telyatinki .
MASHA: You would n't look at me .
VALENTIN: It was difficult in front of the others .
MASHA: But it was n't difficult in you ed When it was only you and me in front of God .
VALENTIN: I 'm not sure I was conscious of God .
MASHA: So , I made you forget God ?
VALENTIN: No
MASHA: Yes , only for a moment . You forgot your rules and remembered love .
VALENTIN: You make it sound very simple .
MASHA: It is simple . What we did is what men and women do , have done , will continue doing . What could be more simple ? We touched each other stayed close together . Something passed between us . Something real . That is a etrayal of what ? Of nothing .
VALENTIN: I 'm afraid I 've hurt you , haven´t
MASHA: No . I feel a little sad , but it is not for me . It 's for you .
SOFYA: Good morning , my darling ? Do you mind if I join you ? Without looking up
TOLSTOY: Of course , my dear .
SOFYA: It 's quite insane , my darling . Everyone is making fun of you . He looks up .
TOLSTOY: What are you talking about ? She continues to write .
SOFYA: Even the muzhiks . I heard them laughing in the barn .
TOLSTOY: About what ? Sofya looks at him knowingly .
SOFYA: I do n't want to ruin last night .
TOLSTOY: I have a great affection fo Vladimir Grigorivich . Let them laugh if they find it amusing .
SOFYA: But it 's not amusing , darling . It 's sick . It 's not normal . You hang on his every word .
TOLSTOY: We have a great deal in common .
SOFYA: You have nothing in common . You are a genius . He 's a sycophant and a pervert .
TOLSTOY: Because he understands what I 'm trying to do ? Because he tries to help me accomplish it ?
SOFYA: He is using you . You just ca n't seem to see it .
TOLSTOY: This is absolute nonsense .
SOFYA: That bold , obese , idiotic man . You treat him
TOLSTOY: It 's impossible for you not to distract me . Let me alone fo God 's sake . You 're like a spoiled child .
SOFYA: Do you love me , Lyovochka ?
TOLSTOY: Of course , I do .
SOFYA: Then why would you betray me ?
TOLSTOY: Why do you say that ?
SOFYA: Because of the will ?
TOLSTOY: There 's no new will . She stares at him in silence .
SOFYA: Does Chertkov have it ?
TOLSTOY: There 's no new will . He walks up the stairs . She follows .
SOFYA: But that 's why he 's come back . You talk about it , you and you oyfriend . You plan for it . You have no heart for the people who eally love you . You 'd rather be seduced by charlatans and deluded y flatterers , all in the name of love.You ca n't even love you own children . You ca n't even love me .
TOLSTOY: There is no new will .
SOFYA: Then , promise me there never will e. A moment 's hesitation .
TOLSTOY: I´ve told you the truth . Now , let me work . Please , will you ? He walks to his desk .
SOFYA: Tomorrow , I 'll go to the Station and lie down on the track . Tolstoy 's wife becomes Anna Karenina herself ! See how the papers will like that ! As he goes , we hear .
VALENTIN: She 's here to question you about the new will . Chertkov nervous , tugs at his moustache .
CHERTKOV: How does she know it even exists ?
VALENTIN: She claims Leo Nikolayevich told her she could examine the draft .
CHERTKOV: He is obviously not thinking clearly . And now we have to put up with her petty grasping .
VALENTIN: It does n't seem petty to me .
CHERTKOV: I beg your pardon ?
VALENTIN: He ` s her life . The work , in he mind , is theirstogether .
CHERTKOV: And you 're her advocate ? You 've een taken in by her celebrity . I worried about this .
VALENTIN: I 'm talking about their history - simply that .
CHERTKOV: We should see her . Act as if nothing has happened .
VALENTIN: Nothing has happened .
CHERTKOV: Sofya Andreyevna , at last , you honour us with your visit .
SOFYA: And I 'm happy to make you happyalways . She looks at him curiously .
CHERTKOV: What is it ?
SOFYA: Your moustache is Drooping , one side of it anyway .
CHERTKOV: It 's a problem of the wax . Sofya takes them in .
SOFYA: Let me get to the point . Vladimi Grigorivich , I do n't wish to be your enemy . I 'm delighted that my husband has a friend who understands and shares his ideals . All I want is what 's easonable - an opportunity to evaluate the new will . If you agree , I 'm sure we can be friends .
CHERTKOV: You 're very kind . Sofya Andreyevna . But I ca n't help you . Not without specific instructions from your husband .
SOFYA: Leo Nikolayevich has agreed , has n't he Val-
CHERTKOV: No witness you produce will change my position . But I 'll certainly talk to Leo Nikolayevich at the first opportunity . Sofya is livid .
SOFYA: Very well .
CHERTKOV: I want us to be friends , too , Sofya . Leo Nikolayevich is the most valuable thing in the world , for both of us . We should endeavor to set things right etween us . Give him peace . Let him work .
SOFYA: Yes . Valentin Fedorovichare you coming back to the house with me ?
VALENTIN: I 'll escort the Countess home and e back in time for supper . Sergeyenko sneers .
SERGEYENKO: Masha will be overjoyed .
SOFYA: We 've become close friends , I think . Tell me everything , dea oy . I love a romance .
VALENTIN: It 's nothing , really .
SOFYA: A young woman in your life is nothing ?
VALENTIN: Masha is a friend .
SOFYA: A lover ?
VALENTIN: A good friend .
SOFYA: That sounds serious enough . Valentin looks away .
VALENTIN: I 'm not annoyed .
SOFYA: You forget that I 'm an experienced reader . I can read your face , every letter . It 's eautifully clear . Do you love her ? Valentin looks at Sofya , tears in his eyes .
VALENTIN: Maybe I do .
SOFYA: Not something they 'd understand , these so called disciples of my husband . They 've never understood a word he 's written . What do any of them know about love ?
VALENTIN: Sorry , sorry , I 'll I did n't mean to scare youAre you alright .
MASHA: FinefineWhy did you ?
VALENTIN: I came back as soon as I could . It was a strange day . Leo Nikolayevich , I love to listen to him . I love nothing more He moves closer to her .
MASHA: I think I 've confused you . I 've confused us both .
VALENTIN: No . No . You didn´t confuse me..I was stupid . I was afraid , but I 'm not afraid anymore .
MASHA: Maybe you could help me a little .
VALENTIN: Masha She turns
MASHA: Yes
VALENTIN: I think about you all the time . In my heart I´ve comitted the act of copulation many times . I just want to sayIt was never like it was with you . Masha bursts out laughing .
MASHA: I 'll wait for you , then .
SOFYA: Ivan , who 's wearing that awful perfume ?
CHERTKOV: I hate to say it but the Countess has become more and more dangerous .
TOLSTOY: Not dangerous She 's concerned for the welfare of the family .
CHERTKOV: And we 're concerned for the welfare of mankind . Take this down .
TOLSTOY: It´s a terrible thing you ask . I can´t do it .
CHERTKOV: You 've been more than reasonable . She already controls the income from your property .
SASHA: Listen to him , papa . He has ou est interests at heart .
CHERTKOV: We 're speaking only of the rights to your words , your ideas .
TOLSTOY: She 's my wife . She´s part of me . We 've been together now , so many years . Chertkov drives the point home .
CHERTKOV: But you 're more than a husband and father . She must understand that . The best interests of the people are one with your own . You elong to them .
DUSHAN: It´s sadly more than possible .
SASHA: I know it´s hard for you , papa . But we must be realistic .
SOFYA: How dare you ?
SASHA: What are you doing ?
SOFYA: You 're all plotting against me . In my own house , too . I bear you thirteen children . How can you etray me like this ? Someone help me up . No one moves . Tolstoy slumps in his chair .
DUSHAN: Please , Countess Sofya-
SASHA: Mama , please
SOFYA: Now
TOLSTOY: Can I notCan I not have His face is red , his body rigid with anger .
SASHA: You 'll kill him , Mama . That 's what you want , is n't it ? You want him to die ! ''
SOFYA: You ! Do n't think you deceive me for one little moment ! I know exactly what you 're doing . I want to see the will . It 's my ight , in the name of god .
CHERTKOV: What are you afraid of ?
SOFYA: You . I 'm afraid of you .
CHERTKOV: The press is bloodthirsty . Had I wished , I could 've demolished you and your family . You make it easy .
SOFYA: Tell them anything you like . Go ahead . Ruin us .
CHERTKOV: I have too much respect for Leo Nikolayevich . You 're lucky .
SOFYA: Why ca n't my husband see you fo what you are ?
CHERTKOV: If I had a wife like you , I would have blown my brains out long ago . Or gone to America .
VALENTIN: I hope you 're feeling better .
SOFYA: Do you like the opera ?
VALENTIN: I took singing lessons for years . I thought about a career in music . The only thing I lacked , in the end , was talent . I 'm sorry about everything . She smiles .
SOFYA: This aria is very beautiful.. It is about a woman who is abandoned y the man who loves herEveryone is very moved by thatin the opera .
TOLSTOY: Our life together has become intolerable .
SOFYA: Sit down , Valentin .
VALENTIN: Really , I 'm expected at Telyatinki . She waves it off .
SOFYA: No , no , no . Enjoy your dinner . We 've had a disagreement . No more than any other married couple .
TOLSTOY: I did n't come for more ecrimination . Despite good cause for alienation between us , I have never stopped loving you .
SOFYA: Of course
TOLSTOY: God knows you do n't make it easy .
SOFYA: Why should it be easy ? I 'm the work of your life . You 're the work of mine . Its what love is . Aside to Valentin .
VALENTIN: I should go .
TOLSTOY: Sit down . So , this is what love is . Does that surprise you , boy ? They both look at him
VALENTIN: I thought it might be quieter , ut-
TOLSTOY: He 's right , though . If we can not live a decent , quiet life , if I can not work , if I can not find some peace , I shall simply go away .
SOFYA: Go ? Where ?
TOLSTOY: Not to Chertkov , but I shall go .
SOFYA: Go where ?
TOLSTOY: Dushan says you 're killing me . Sofya rises up in cold rage .
SOFYA: Then go ! Go ! Anywhere you please !
VALENTIN: CountessAre you alright ?
SOFYA: You 'll destroy me .
VALENTIN: Is she alright ?
DUSHAN: Sofya ! Open your eyes .
SOFYA: My back . My back I 'm hurting .
DUSHAN: You 're lying on a fork . Sit up and you 'll improve markedlyValentin , help to get her upstairs , would you ?
VALENTIN: It was terrible there today etween them . They loved each other so much , but you see what it becomes . She stays at the sink , says nothing .
MASHA: I 'm going back to Moscow .
VALENTIN: What ? He gets up , goes to her .
MASHA: Chertkov spoke with me this afternoon . He says I could be more useful therewhich means Valentin shakes his head . His lip trembles .
VALENTIN: This is him punishing us , punishing me for befriending Sofya Andreyevna . For not This is Chertkov .
MASHA: We 've both disappointed him .
VALENTIN: I do n't care . You ca n't go away . I 'll talk to him . I 'll make him change his mind . i´m going to make you stay .
MASHA: No , I want to go .
VALENTIN: What ?
MASHA: I 'm leaving the movement .
VALENTIN: You can´t leave Tolstoy .
MASHA: I am not . Look , when I read his Confession , it moved me , Valya . He was searching for freedom . Freedom from anger . Freedom from attachment . Freedom from all the superstition and nonsense of the church . It moved me so much . I thought that 's what it would be about . Is n't that what it 's about ? Freedom and love ? But they mix it all up .
VALENTIN: Do n't leave me , Masha I need you . She turns back for a moment .
MASHA: I know you doI know . Then she 's gone .
ROSSOLIMO: I believe the Countess suffers from a mental degeneracy , paranoic and hysterical , chiefly the former .
DUSHAN: Yes .
TOLSTOY: Why did you bring him here ?
DUSHAN: He 's an old friend , you know , from Rome .
TOLSTOY: And astoundingly stupid in the way of all scientists .
DUSHAN: Yes .
TOLSTOY: Take them downstairs . Thank them for me . Offer them a drink .
DUSHAN: You 'll be alright ?
TOLSTOY: Valentin Fedorovich will stay with me , wo n't you , boy
SOFYA: YayouryourI can´t emember nowYo , what did I say ? What did you mean ?
TOLSTOY: You rest now .
CHERTKOV: Good afternoon , Leo Nikolayevich .
TOLSTOY: Is it ?
CHERTKOV: This will insure that the complete works will live in the public domain .
SERGEYENKO: Monumentous .
CHERTKOV: Your work is the birthright of the Russian people . Now , they possess it forever . Tolstoy looks up at them .
TOLSTOY: I need a pen .
CHERTKOV: Of course .
SERGEYENKO: Iuh
CHERTKOV: What ?
SERGEYENKO: He 's a secretary , too . Ask him .
CHERTKOV: Valentin Fedorovich , do you have a pen ?
VALENTIN: I do . Valentin fetches it from his satchel .
CHERTKOV: Are you alright ?
TOLSTOY: I feel like a conspirator .
VALENTIN: Maybe we should get back . It 'll e dark soon . May I ask you something that has nothing to do with work ?
TOLSTOY: Of course , my dear .
VALENTIN: Do you love your wife ?
TOLSTOY: `` Your youth and your desire fo happiness reminds me cruelly of my age and the impossibility of happiness for me . '' When I was courting Sofya , she was so young and pure , it seemed impossible that I 'd ever have her . I did n't want to tell her how I felt and I wanted to tell he nothing else . So I wrote down a string of letters and asked he if she could decipher them . She looked completely confused , thinking it was a game or
CHERTKOV: Thank you again , Valentin Fedorovich , for your forethought .
VALENTIN: I 'm a secretary , after all . Chertkov let 's it go .
CHERTKOV: You know I had thought for a time to suggest that Leo Nikolayevich look for someone else . Buthe said no . He said `` He reminds me of myself when I was young . ''
VALENTIN: I 'm leaving Telyatinki .
CHERTKOV: Really .
VALENTIN: I am going to Moscow .
CHERTKOV: She is leading you around the nose .
VALENTIN: Look , you say the movement 's about love-
CHERTKOV: Yes The love he tells us to practice , the love of the Gospels . Why do I have to explain this ? Perfect love . Eternal love . The love that binds mankind together .
VALENTIN: But I 've never met mankind , only men and women , imperfect men , imperfect women .
CHERTKOV: Leo Nikolayevich also teaches us love can not be weakminded . Go . You wo n't be missed a naive sentimentalist
VALENTIN: I 'm laughing because I did n't sneeze .
SOFYA: Lyovochka ? Prozeveskeny wants to purchase the rights to your work after your death .
TOLSTOY: Then I shall try and die as soon as is convenient .
SOFYA: Do n't be silly . They 've offered one million rubles . Silence .
TOLSTOY: I do n't write for publishers . I write for people . He gets up from his desk .
SOFYA: Where are you going ?
TOLSTOY: Valentin 's in the library . He 's asked to speak to me .
SOFYA: Splendidwhile your wretched family is left to starve .

CHERTKOV: What ? Promised you what ? You´ve seen her at close quarters , boy . You think she´s capable of estraining herself ?
VALENTIN: They have a whole life togehter . Why do you have to deny that ?
CHERTKOV: You 're a victim of her romantic nonsense . You seem to forget she wants to destroy everything we do . She travels with that unctious little priest .
VALENTIN: Keep the priest away-
CHERTKOV: These people are vultures . They send in at the last moment and welcome him back to the church . That 's their fantasy . A death bed recantation . Do you have any idea the damage it would do ? Everything he 's dreamed of , everything we 've worked for will e gone . A simple noble death is what we want . It is what he wants .
VALENTIN: No , you want an icon . You want to take photographs and give out postcards..You want people to kneel in front of an image you´ve created . But he doesn´t wanted that . He never wanted that , and it will give him no peace . He wants to see herlet he come .
CHERTKOV: I will do everything in my powe to prevent that .
VALENTIN: Oh , God . You exhaust me .
CHERTKOV: I used to think you were just naive , Valentin , maybe a little stupid . I see now you 're more dangerous than she is . He turns back at the door .
VALENTIN: Tell me one thing . That image you want to create , just looks like you , doesn´t it ? Valentin leaves the room .

And I 'd come home after school and she 'd be gone . In jail o something . And I used to I used to have to milk a cow every morning and every night and I liked that . I remember

And he wore overalls and he smoked a clay pipe . Half the time he would n't put tobacco in it . And I hated the work . It was hot and dirty and it broke my back . And all day long I 'd watch his spit which would run down the pipe stem and hang on the bowl of the pipe . And I used to make bets with myself on when it was going to fall off . And I always lost . I never saw it fall off . I 'd just look around and it 'd be gone and then the new one would be there . And then we had a beautiful My mother My mother taught me to love nature .

TOM: You see , Jeanne , this flat wo n't work for us . This flat , it wo n't work for us , Jeanne .
JEANNE: Where are you going ?
TOM: To look for a flat . He walks out to a SHOCKED Jeanne .
JEANNE: What kind of flat ? But he COMES BACK .
TOM: A flat we can live in .
JEANNE: We can live here .
TOM: It 's squalid . It smells . It makes me sick . Are you coming with me ?

PAUL: It 's me again .
JEANNE: It 's over . It 's over .
PAUL: It 's over , then it begins again .
JEANNE: What begins again ? I do n't understand anything any more .
PAUL: There 's nothing to understand . We left the apartment . Now we begin again with love and all the rest of it .
JEANNE: The rest ?
PAUL: Yeah , listen . He puts his arm around her as THEY STROLL .
PAUL'S VOICE: But you know , what the hell . I 'm no prize . I picked up a nail when I was in Cuba in and now I got a prostate like an Idaho potato . But I 'm still a good stick man , even if I ca n't have any children . Let 's see . I do n't have any stomping grounds . I do n't have any friends . I suppose if I had n't met you , I 'd probably settle for a hard chai and a hemorrhoid . Anyway , to make a long , dull story even duller , I come from a time when a guy like me would drop into a joint like this and pick up a young chick like you and and call her a bimbo .
PAUL: I 'm awfully sorry to intrude ut I was so struck with you eauty that I thought I could offe you a glass of champagne . Is this seat taken ?

JEANNE: Monsieur Maitre d'Hôtel .
PAUL: That 's rather nasty . Anyway , you dummy , I love you . And I want to live with you .
JEANNE: In your flophouse ?
PAUL: In my flophouse . What the hell does that mean ? What the hell difference does it make if I have a flophouse or a hotel or a castle ? I love you . What the fuck difference does it make ? !

He tried to rape me . I do n't know . I do n't know him . I do n't know who he is . He 's a lunatic . I do n't know his name .
911 OPERATOR: 911 operator , what is your emergency ?
CLYDE: eyes
COP #1: Dispatch , we have multiple 10-55s , need full response , 11-41 .
CLYDE: When I found my wife and child dead , my little girl 's eyes were open . The last thing she saw of this earth were the faces of the men who took her life . Can you understand that ?
CANTRELL: Divorced . I have a son and daughter . Both in college .
CLYDE: My daughter was ten . I married late in life .
CLYDE: You , Mr. Price ? Married ? Kids ?
NICK: I 've seen the crime scene photos , Mr. Clyde . Many times . They 're horrifying . But they do n't alte the facts of the case .
CLYDE: Facts ? Those men are guilty . Both of them . You know they are .
NICK: This is n't about what we know . It 's about what we can prove in court .
CANTRELL: Things have gone against us . Tainted crime scene , evidence thrown out
NICK: Look . We 've had only one real break in this case . The fact that one asshole has decided to testify against the other asshole .
CLYDE: In return for immunity . So he gets away with it .
CANTRELL: The other man does n't . He 'll go down for the crime . That has to count for something .
CLYDE: Yes . It counts for half . Do n't reward one of the men who murdered my family . Please .
NICK: Mr. Clyde . I ca n't claim to know what it 's like to be in you position . Losing your wife and child . But please try to grasp how limited our options are . This is how the justice system works .
CLYDE: Ah . I see my mistake . I came fo justice . Instead I got a system .
SARAH: It 's okay . On he goes . Nick and Cantrell exit the room .
NICK: Thank you , voice of doom .
NICK: It 's your office .
CANTRELL: It 's your decision .
NICK: What do you think ?
NICK: You were top of your class at Yale , do n't give me that shit .
CANTRELL: Young lady . Someday you might have
SARAH: Okay . Um . You can take both men to trial , spend a year and millions of taxpayer dollars , and probably lose . Or you can cut a deal and at least put one of the men who did the crime
CANTRELL: When the day comes that you argue a eal case in court , you might refrain from summing up with `` duh . ''
JUDGE BURCH: The agreement has been vetted by oth sides ? Satisfactory to all ?
REYNOLDS: Yes , your Honor . Defense approves .
CANTRELL: State also approves , your Honor .
NICK: Clarence Darby . This document guarantees that you will provide testimony against Rupert Ames in the matter of which you were both accused . In return , you will be
REYNOLDS: You 'll do a maximum of five years . With good behavior , you could be out in three .
JUDGE BURCH: That also depends on your testimony and the level of your cooperation .
DARBY: Your Honor need not worry on my account . I assure the court that I am aware of the opportunity I 've een given . And I am deeply grateful to all concerned .
NICK: You can always sue him .
DARBY: Well , no matter . My tongue will wag in court , under oath . His tongue will wag in hell . He puts pen to paper , looks to Nick .
NICK: We do n't do chair . We do needle .
CANTRELL: I 'm not blind . Yet . I 'll do it .
NICK: You 're shitty on stairs . At least let me take the leash so the dog does n't pull you down .
CANTRELL: No . She needs to imprint on me . Not you , not somebody else .
NICK: I 'll pass .
DARBY: it was a burglary gone wrong . We thought the house was empty . Rupert found the woman and child at home and went crazy . I was stoned and in fear of my own life , so I fled
CANTRELL: Bill ! You let all your clients give testimony on the courthouse steps ?
REYNOLDS: Hellooo , kettle to pot . Since when do you shy away from publicity ?
NICK: Since everything in this case has gone sideways so far . Tell your boy to save it for the courtroom .
REYNOLDS: He 's your boy too now . You tell him . Reynolds proceeds down the steps
NICK: Asshole .
REYNOLDS: Dickwad .
CANTRELL: Fuckface .
DARBY: and may I say for the record how very sorry I am that I failed to prevent Rupert Ames from committing those terrible crimes
NICK: You good here ?
CANTRELL: Long as nobody bumps into me .
DARBY: been given a chance to put the drugs and foul living behind me . To atone for my past failings and weakness of character . It is a gift given me by God 's grace
KELL: Shit day ?
NICK: Shit day . Better now . How 's she doing ?
KELL: Fine . She drove me a little crazy today .
NICK: She was busy ?
KELL: In overdrive . Here . Feel .
NICK: I had to say some things to a man today I did n't want to say . And I did something I did n't want to do .
KELL: You did n't lie to him . Or bullshit him . Or shine him on .
NICK: None of those things .
KELL: So you had your reasons . You did what you had to . It 's not your fault the world sucks . Nick smiles , eases his face to her belly .
NICK: You in there . Listen up . Your mothe just said the world sucks . You may wan na rethink this whole thing . My advice ? If you 're asking ? Just stay in there . I promise you , nothing will ever make as much sense as it does right now
KELL: What is wrong with you ?
NICK: plus there 's shit you do n't need to know about . Rap . Internet porn . Madonna 's entire back catalog .
KELL: Did someone drop you on your head ? Seriously . I have swollen ankles and all I do is pee . That baby 's coming out .
NICK: Okay . I 'm sure you heard that . Then again there are the Beatles . 70 's funk . Louie . Ella . Be a shame to miss those . All right , kid . Bring it on . But when you 're old enough for the world to disappoint you , I hope you wo n't lame your old man for bringing you into this mess . Give me that at least .
EMMA: Dad ?
NICK: Huh ? Wha ?
EMMA: You know what it is ?
NICK: What ?
KELL: Glad it 's once a year .
EMMA: Why ca n't you be here ?
NICK: It 's a work thing . Grownup stuff . You know that happens sometimes .
EMMA: But it 's
NICK: I believe we 've established that . I let go , you 'll stop reminding me ? We 'll celebrate this weekend . Tonight
EMMA: Okay . But what are you doing tonight that is more important than
KELL: Something he 'd get out of if he
NICK: Nice evasion . Thanks .
CANTRELL: Till the stitches heal . Week o two . Nick dotes on the dog , they 're old pals
NICK: Poor honey . Sucks , does n't it ? But you 're very pretty . Yes , you are . Even with a radar dish on your head .
SARAH: There they are . Like clockwork .
WARDEN IGER: Rupert Ames . Do you have anything to say ?
RUPERT: I 'm here . Clarence Darby ai n't . And that ai n't right . 'Cause that man is evil , ai n't no other way to say it . All them things he done , and him turn witness against me for it . He pauses , trying to untangle his thoughts .
SARAH: Oh , Jesus .
CANTRELL: What 's going on ? Nick ?
NICK: I do n't know ! Rupert is fast becoming a horror
IGER: We 're still trying to sort through this thing .
CANTRELL: Gentlemen , we face a terrible shitstorm of scrutiny in the days to come . We need answers . Start with what we know .
IGER: Lethal injection is a series of drugs given in a specific order . Somebody had to have replaced one or more of those ingredients with something else . Industrial solvent ? Acid ?
DUNNIGAN: Let 's not guess , let forensics do its job .
CANTRELL: How could the chemicals be switched ?
SARAH: Show them . The bad part .
SARAH: The bad part . I was just on with the Governor 's office . He commuted Rupert Ames ' sentence . They were trying to call us to stop the execution . They could n't get through .
DUNNIGAN: The Governor 's incoming numbe triggered this device and shut out any further calls .
CANTRELL: Oh , fuck me . Fuck me .
NICK: Clarence Darby . That 's what he said when he agreed to testify against the man we executed tonight .
DUNNIGAN: `` His tongue will wag in hell . '' Those very words ? It was ten years ago .
SARAH: I remember it too . Some things stick in your head .
NICK: Check the court transcripts , they 're public record .
DUNNIGAN: You think , or you know ?
DUNNIGAN: Okay , raise Bernstein , I want everything he 's got , including an address . We roll with tactical .
NICK: How about I ride-along ? Give you a fast , accurate ID on this guy ?
CANTRELL: Is that necessary ?
NICK: You said yourself we should move fast . This thing 'll be all over the morning news cycle . We 'd all look a lot better if we have the right man in custody by then . Off Cantrell 's look
GARZA: That 's him . `` Wayne Dunlap . ''
DUNNIGAN: Is that Clarence Darby ?
NICK: I think so . Hard to tell .
DUNNIGAN: Jesus , look at this . No wonde Bernstein loves him .
GARZA: We scored a lot of good intel off this fuckhead through the years . Almost a shame to bag the guy . A snort from Nick . The cops glance back .
NICK: A shame ?
GARZA: He 's helped us put a lot of bad people behind bars . Look . Arrests , convictions
NICK: I can read a C.I . profile . What I see is an asshole dirty up to his ears in the drug trade . So you cops look the other way ? He gets a free pass as long as he keeps feeding you convictions ?
DUNNIGAN: Is n't that what you did ten years ago ? Give this guy a free pass in eturn for a conviction ? Maybe we played this asshole to ou advantage on the street , but you 're the one who put him there . So , no offense , but you might wan na go fuck yourself a little .
DARBY: Waitwait
LISA: This shit makes you soft , baby .
DARBY: Thank youfor stating the obviousyoubitch
LISA: You know that guy ?
DARBY: Knew . Past tense . CELL PHONE RINGS , he answers .
VOICE: Wayne ?
DARBY: Depends . Who 's this ?
VOICE: Somebody who does n't want to see you in jail . Look out your window . Argue later . Do it now .
VOICE: There 's a world of shit coming you way . I 'd get out the back . Now .
LISA: What ?
DARBY: OFF ' A ME !
COP VOICE: You ! Freeze right there !
DUNNIGAN: STAY DOWN !
VOICE: Ditch the gun . Wipe the prints .
DARBY: Kiss my ass .
VOICE: I heard six shots . Revolver ? Bring extra ammo ?
DARBY: What 'll it cost me ?
VOICE: We 'll discuss terms later . Go south , across 10th . Past the El tracks . Alley behind the clinic .
DARBY: What 's there ?
DARBY: How do you know ?
VOICE: 'Cause I tasered his ass . You gon na keep asking questions ?
DUNNIGAN: No way he 's getting out of this neighborhood .
DARBY: Drive .
COP: Do n't shoot ! Do n't hurt me , okay ?
DARBY: Depends on you . Go .
COP VOICE: air unit threesee no sign of suspectthink we lost him
DUNNIGAN: Keep sweeping the area , unit three .
DARBY: In the ditch .
COP: pleasedo n't kill me
DARBY: Knees . Let 's go .
COP: I 'll never see my wife and little girl again . I 'll never see them .
DARBY: It 's fucked up .
COP: I see you got out okay .
BENSON CLYDE: You took them from me .
CLYDE: Ca n't speak ?
FEMALE VOICE: unit twenty one , come inunit twenty one , please respondreport your location
EMMA: and while we were singing karaoke , Ashley was all dancing around and jumping up and down and suddenly she gets this look on her face
KELL: I saw it coming .
EMMA: and suddenly she just went barf . Total puke moment . And we were all like , ewwww gross ! It was so funny
KELL: Funny for her . I cleaned it up .
NICK: I had my `` ewwww gross '' moment last night too .
KELL: Hey . I had a house full of shrieking ten year-old girls .
NICK: Hey . I saw a guy 's veins dissolve .
KELL: Honey . It 's not a competition . Okay , you win .
EMMA: so Tara says that 's what you get for eating too much cake and that almost made Ashley puke again
KELL: Delivery .
EMMA: I 'll get it !
NICK: Oh , shit . We 've gone national .
EMMA: Thank you !
HILTS: I never saw a faceeither timehe wore a thing , a face shield
VOICE: Sergeant ! Sergeant !
YOUNG COP: Come quick ! You got ta see this !
EMMA: Daddy ?
KELL: Oh my God !
SERGEANT: Oh my Lord .
GARZA: Price got a video of it happening delivered to his house
DUNNIGAN: Yeah , we know . Nick , we know . The ody 's been found . The pieces , anyway . Call just came in .
NICK: Belonging to who ?
DUNNIGAN: Benson Clyde . You have the right to emain silent
CLYDE: Yes .
SARAH: He says he 'll only talk to you .
CLYDE: Counselor .
NICK: Mr. Clyde .
CLYDE: Why so formal ? We go way back . Call me Benson . Or Ben .
NICK: Well . I 'm here . So ?
CLYDE: So . Maybe you can explain what this is all about .
NICK: I think that 's obvious .
DUNNIGAN: You murdered two people . Rupert Ames and Clarence Darby .
CLYDE: Detective ?
DUNNIGAN: Dunnigan .
CLYDE: Dunnigan . I thought I 'd made it clear I would only speak to the gentleman across the table from me . Dunnigan glowers at him , looks to Nick .
NICK: You murdered two people . Rupert Ames and Clarence Darby .
CLYDE: Darby ? I knew about Ames , of course . I 've been following the news about his horribly botched execution . But Darby too ? Quite a coincidence .
DUNNIGAN: Cut the shit . We know you did it . Save everybody a lot of time and trouble and just confess .
CLYDE: Are you going to continue to insist on being part of this conversation ?
DUNNIGAN: Yes .
CLYDE: Fine . Far be it from me to be rude .
NICK: Clarence Darby was found on you
CLYDE: I did n't know I had one . It 's 150 acres , uncultivated . The other day I found a creek I never knew I had . Hunters trespass all the time . You going to try to pin the dead dee on me too ?
SARAH: I do n't believe this guy .
CANTRELL: That man is frosty .
CLYDE: It occurs to me that an even moderately clever person could try to frame me for the murder simply y killing him on my property . One of Darby 's drug rivals ? That 's an unsavory world . A jury would have to weigh that possibility . What else you got ?
NICK: How about video of you dismembering Darby while he was still alive ?
CLYDE: That 's odd . See , if I were to do such a thing , I 'd probably wea something so I could n't be identified . Some kind of mask maybe . But you say it 's actually me on the video ? Did the camera capture my
NICK: You sick fuck , you sent it to my house ! My daughter saw that video ! It fucking traumatized her ! She could n't stop sobbing !
DUNNIGAN: Whoa-whoa , Nick , ease off !
CLYDE: No trouble here , Detective , we 're fine . Thank you , though .
DUNNIGAN: Okay , enough .
CLYDE: Unless there 's hard evidence tying me to these crimes forensic o otherwise why am I here ? Why are we having this conversation ?
NICK: We know you did it .
CLYDE: It 's not about what you know . It 's about what you can prove in court . Your words . Like when you called it a justice system . You know the thing about a system , Nick ? Any system can be played .
NICK: You think you can play us ? You gon na take me on ?
CLYDE: Clarence Darby did . And I 'm much smarter than he was . Or you .
NICK: I 'm gon na bury you , fucker !
CLYDE: That 's it , that 's what I want ! That fire in the belly ! That 's what I wanted ten years ago ! Do it , Nick ! Bury me !
DUNNIGAN: Sit down ! Sit the fuck down ! Clyde does , settles in , speaking calmly
CLYDE: Or . Set me free .
NICK: What ?
CLYDE: Did I stutter ? Make your case . Or . Shake my hand on the courthouse steps and send me on my way . I 'll even make it easy on you . I will confess , how 's that ?
NICK: You 're gon na confess .
CLYDE: Let 's start tomorrow after a good night 's sleep . We 'll all be fresh and rested .
NICK: Confession or not , we 're gon na nail him on two counts of first-degree .
CANTRELL: Agreed , but softly . Nothing hard- ass , no grand-standing . Kid gloves .
NICK: Kid gloves ? He 's a psycho with a power saw .
CANTRELL: Depending on who 's writing the headline , he 's a grieving husband and father who got revenge on the men who murdered his wife and child . Public sympathy is to be respected and feared . This could blow up in our faces if we 're not careful . We ca n't look like we 're pissed off o have an ax to grind . Are we pissed off ? Do we have an ax to grind ?
NICK: No .
CANTRELL: Then stop acting like it . Beat . Nick takes a deep breath .
NICK: Okay . He got under my skin a little . That 's done .
SARAH: How about outside help ? That P.I . who helped us on the Jacovitz case ?
KELL: Well , hello there beauty !
SARAH: Hey Kell ! Hey Emma , how 's my dynamo ?
EMMA: Hi , Sarah !
KELL: We have n't seen you in so long it 's idiculous . When are you gon na come y for a visit ?
SARAH: Who needs a life , right ? Talk to your husband , maybe he 'll give us a day off one of these years .
KELL: Soon , huh ? Seriously , we miss you .
NICK: Fuck .
KELL: She had a bad dream . She wanted to sleep with us tonight .
NICK: Jesus .
EMMA: Daddy ?
NICK: I know . Shhh . We 're all good . You 're safe . Nobody 's gon na hurt you .
KELL: Especially not that man . Daddy 's gon na put him in jail forever . That 's what daddy does . He makes sure the ad people stay locked away . Nick lays there , listening
CLYDE: I admit I expected something more
NICK: Filled to capacity . It has been fo years . They had to re-open this fo
CLYDE: Right . Prison crowding . It 's a problem .
NICK: For the record You 've waived legal counsel . You 've offered to confess to the murders of Clarence Darby and Rupert Ames . Yes ?
CLYDE: We 'll get to that . First , what I 'd eally like to talk about is the cot in my cell . It 's lumpy . Hardly any padding ? Steel springs ? Very uncomfortable ?
NICK: I know what lumpy means . Sorry to hear it . But we 're not here to talk about prison conditions , we 're here to talk about things you 've done .
CLYDE: Start with things I have n't done . Like get any sleep last night .
NICK: What do you want from me ?
CLYDE: A bed in my cell .
NICK: A bed . In your cell .
CLYDE: Yes , please . One of those Sleep-
NICK: You want the variable temperature control too ?
CLYDE: That would be nice .
NICK: Anybody ?
CLYDE: Let me get this straight . You 're going to let a bed prevent this confession from taking place .
NICK: You looking to deal ? All right , how 's this ? How about I do n't kick your fucking teeth down your throat ?
CANTRELL: Nick .
NICK: Sorry , Jonas . Okay , kid gloves . My daughter slept in our bed last night . She has n't done that since she was six . You gave her nightmares . So excuse me if I do n't feel like cutting any little deals today .
CLYDE: My daughter ca n't have nightmares ,
NICK: This is bullshit . He 's jerking ou chain big-time
CANTRELL: We 're talking a high-profile double homicide . Order the bed .
CLYDE: I hacked the Fedex database , diverted the package to me , made the switch , sent the package on . It 's automated tracking numbers moving millions of packages daily . Nobody 's questioning who receives what , or why .
NICK: And the prison phones ?
CLYDE: Get a phone company uniform , hack the prison database , schedule an official visit . They 'll wave you through the gate , like they did me . It 's simple if you know how things work . It 's a system . You learn how it works . You play it . Any system .
NICK: I saw him die . That stuff burned his veins . He suffered terribly .
CLYDE: Score . Nick flips to a new page on his pad .
NICK: Let 's move on to Clarence Darby .
IGER: Vinyl records and CDs can be broken into shards . They make excellent weapons . My answer to that one , Mr .
NICK: It 's a legitimate concern .
CLYDE: How about my ipod and speaker dock ?
IGER: The player stays out here . You hand the remote to the on-duty guard every night at lights out . Those terms are n't negotiable .
CLYDE: I appreciate your compromise . Iger draws close to the bars . Quietly
IGER: You looking to get your ass kicked ? By every inmate on this cellblock . You keep this up , they 'll take it out on you . Harshly .
CLYDE: his penis with a box cutter . His skin with a filet knife . His teeth with pliers . His eyesfor those I used my fingers . Check the video I made . All that will match up . I kept him alive fo an hour , give or take . Time it .
NICK: My office types it up , you sign .
CLYDE: How about a signing bonus ? The small concessions you 've made so far have kept my cooperation flowingwhy not give me a reward for signing ?
NICK: You do n't want to sign , do n't sign . We 've got you on videotape , we 'll go to trial . In ten years , when your appeals are exhausted , I 'll attend your execution . I 'll make sure nobody tampers with the drugs .
CLYDE: Do n't be such a hard-ass , Nick . I do n't want much . Just a good meal . The food here ? Sucks . No offense .
DUNNIGAN: What do you have in mind ?
CLYDE: There 's a place in town on Halston .
DUNNIGAN: It 's a little above my pay grade .
NICK: Not gon na happen .
CLYDE: Why not ?
NICK: Because I have no interest in making it happen . And you have nothing left to bargain with .
CLYDE: C'mon , Nick . We 've just started argaining . You have n't even heard what I 'm offering yet .
DUNNIGAN: Who 's William Reynolds ?
CANTRELL: Clarence Darby 's defense attorney . He brokered the testimony deal with us ten years ago . He 's been missing now since
CLYDE: March of '06 .
NICK: Tell me .
CLYDE: How do you think I located Clarence Darby after he got out of jail and legally changed his name ? Reynolds
DAVIES: WILL DO !
CLYDE: GPS position is as follows
SARAH: he holds two dozen patents that have made him a lot of money the last ten years . He 's invested a lot of it in real estate . Weird stuff .
CANTRELL: Weird how ?
CONVICT: Motherfucker
SARAH: but he also gives a big chunk to macular research .
CANTRELL: He donates to eye research ?
SARAH: RPI . That 's the charity you work with , is n't it ?
CANTRELL: Huh . Strange .
CLYDE: Rack of lamb ?
WAITER: oh , yes , rack of lamb
WAITER: You 're bruising the crepes .
GUARD: Life 's a bitch , then you die .
IGER: no plates , they break into nice jagged piecesnothing sharp , nothing that can be made sharpno forks , no knives , no spoons.lose that carafewe will have no potential weapons of any kind this evening , thank youyou can eat with your fingers
CLYDE: The guards will think me gauche .
NICK: Thanks . Keep digging .
IGER: Idiot . Then he too departs , as
DWIGHT: Fuckin ' A .
CLYDE: I wonder what the little people are eating tonight ? Dwight throws his head back and laughs
FORENSIC TECH: Okay , let 's see if we can get him out in one piece
DAVIES: we 'll have to wait for the autopsy esults , but
NICK: Agent Davies ?
IGER: He killed his cellmate . We had to separate him out .
CANTRELL: What 's wrong with solitary ?
IGER: We do n't have the authority . Not without a court order . This place was re-opened under protest as it is . Some areas are off-limits to our use tied up in a legal challenge by the ACLU as cruel and unusual . Especially solitary . It was nicknamed the dungeon
NICK: Get Judge Burch on the phone . Sarah speed-dials as a GUARD lets them in
IGER: Nice trick with the rack of lamb . Did n't see that one coming .
NICK: Why 'd you kill your cellmate ?
CLYDE: I claim self-defense .
NICK: Here 's what I think . You suckered us in . You ordered that meal fo the purpose of killing him .
CANTRELL: Which makes it premeditated . Again .
CLYDE: And , again , you 'll have to prove that in court . As I 've said before make your case . Or set me free .
DUNNIGAN: That is correct , Agent Davies .
DAVIES: So . I 'm gon na rendition your ass . Rumor has it we have places that make Guantanamo look like Disneyland . Do n't bother packing , you 're gon na disappear .
CLYDE: You see , Nick ? That man is pissed ! That 's what I 'm talking about ! No deals , no compromise ! You see ?
NICK: I see you totally disconnected from eality , that 's what I see !
SARAH: Judge Burch with an answer for you .
JUDGE BURCH: I 'm the ACLU 's biggest fundraise in this state . You wan na put that piece of shit in solitary ? Good . As far as I 'm concerned , you can bury him in the bowels of hell .
NICK: Thank you , Judge Burch .
IGER: You 'll have it all to yourself the first man down there in ove twenty years . Quite an achievement .
NICK: You 're doing everything wrong . Making all the wrong moves .
CLYDE: It would seem that way .
NICK: Sam . I know you got hit hard . I know you 're furious . But I 'd like my shot at prosecuting this case .
CLYDE: I 'm seeing fire in your belly , Nick . I like it . Keep going . This is ou deal , after all
CANTRELL: Let 's not mistake this ! This is not about the two of you !
CLYDE: Wake up , blind man ! It 's been exactly that since I watched him shake Clarence Darby 's hand on the steps of the Hall of Justice ten years ago ! The Hall of Justice !
DAVIES: You wan na take this fuck down ? Be my guest . Whatever you need .
CLYDE: That 's the spirit , yes ! It 's on you now , Nick . It 's you game to lose . Just do n't screw up .
NICK: You 're insane .
CLYDE: See how insane you think this is . You 're going to release me from this place with all charges dropped within twenty four hours
NICK: Or what ?
CLYDE: Or I start killing everybody .
CANTRELL: What can he do ? We 've got him boxed in . He 's isolated , for God 's sake .
NICK: Let 's keep him that way . Strict ules apply . Law says he gets one hour outside his cell a day , that 's what he gets . Just one , under heavy guard . The other twenty-three hours , he 's in that cell , he 's a ghost , he does n't exist . No contact whatsoever .
NICK: We underestimated him before . I 'd like to know what this prick is capable of . Update on the background check ?
NICK: What kind of government work leaves a blank spot , Sam ?
DAVIES: I 'll make a few discreet calls . See what I can find out .
KELL: Where are you ?
NICK: Million miles away . Sorry .
KELL: Do n't be . This guy 's really doing a number on your head , is n't he ?
NICK: Yeah . I guess he is . It'skilling his cellmate . I need that to make sense .
KELL: Why ? Happens in prison all the time .
NICK: Yeah , I know , butwe 're not talking some gang-banger . This man is precise . Does things for a reason .
KELL: He 's psycho . You said so yourself . We saw it on that video . Psychos do n't need a reason , Nick . They 're just psycho .
NICK: Thanks . I 'm a poor excuse , though . It 's date night . You deserve better .
WAITER: Have we decided ?
NICK: Sam ? What is it ? Not far , maybe six blocks . I 'm having dinner with my wife .
DAVIES: Two words doggy bag . Be in you
NICK: He 's coming here ?
DAVIES: So I 'm told . It 's called inter-agency cooperation , but do n't ask me what agency because I would n't know . This is n't even back-channels , this is Theseus in the fucking Labyrinth . I just blew thirty years ' worth of favors today calling in this one
NICK: Yes . Yes , we 're all here . Downstairs ? Okay . Understood . He said not to take the elevator . Off their puzzled looks
SPOOK: Which one of you is Davies ?
NICK: What are we dealing with ?
SPOOK: Things I can neither confirm no deny . Things of which , if I 'm asked , I will disavow any knowledge .
CANTRELL: You got ta be kidding me with this guy .
SPOOK: He 's not . Tell me you grasp the implication of what I 've said , o we 're done here .
CANTRELL: Yeah . Okay . I get it .
NICK: What was Clyde ? Some kind of spy ?
SPOOK: Spooks like me are a dime a dozen . Clyde was a brain . He ran a think- tank , inventing things for use in the field . Ways to kill people . You need to get rid of somebody . It 's not a situation where you can get close . What do you do ?
NICK: Ask Clyde ?
SPOOK: That 's right . Ask Clyde . And he 'd figure something out . Gizmos , strategy . He was good at it .
NICK: How good ?
SPOOK: You play chess ?
NICK: Yeah . Tournament level in college , matter of fact .
SPOOK: In my line , we use an aptitude profile based on chess . A tournament- level player like you can think five to eight steps ahead of an average player , did you know that ? Me , I think about ten steps ahead , so I 'd take you in a game .
NICK: What about Clyde ?
SPOOK: Off the charts . If you 're eight steps ahead , he 's twenty . Or fifty . He 's already got the game won on the first move , you do n't even know you 're playing yet . This cellmate he killed ? You think that was random ? Bullshit . That was a pawn taken off the board . If I were you , I 'd be trying to figure out what the move was .
NICK: I have been . Any thoughts ?
SPOOK: Top of my head ? Was the cellmate ever connected with this case ? O with Clyde ? Was anybody else in that facility ? Guards ? Cons ? The janitor ? Any connection at all , no matter how remote . Because if Clyde says he has things in play , he does .
DAVIES: Like what ? He 's locked up . What can he do ?
SPOOK: You 're an average chess player , are n't you ?
DAVIES: Actually , I kind of suck .
SPOOK: I can tell . But I like your tie .
DAVIES: Thank you . Father 's Day .
SPOOK: There 's this tie we call it the Albert , after Albert DeSalvo . They tiptoe in one night , thread a piano wire with a ratchet gizmo into one
EMMA: Daddy ! Emma jumps up and runs over for a hug .
NICK: Let me talk to mom first .
KELL: It 's fine . You learn anything ?
NICK: Thing or two .
KELL: Nick ?
NICK: Hey , I was thinking . Maybe you could pack an overnight bag for you and Emma in case you need toyou knowspend the night in a hotel . Or something .
KELL: Why would we wan na do that ?
NICK: No reason . It 's like a fire-drill thing . You know . In case .
KELL: Honey ?
EMMA: Daddy ?
NICK: It 's okay , baby I 'm fine , I promise . Go back to your game .
KELL: Seriously , Nick . What the fuck .
NICK: Nothing . I got paranoid for no eason , that 's all . I 'm fine now . I ca n't believe I let that son of a itch Clyde get to me like that .
KELL: Are you in danger ? Are we ?
JAMESON: This could take days .
SARAH: We boring you , Jameson ? You got someplace to be ?
JAMESON: No , Miss Lowell .
SARAH: Weekend plans ? Cancel 'em ! I do n't wan na hear any shit about it ! Clack-clack , Jameson . Clack-clack .
NICK: Well ?
DUNNIGAN: It used to be a Sleep-Matic adjustable bed . Now it 's not .
NICK: What do you have ?
TEAM LEADER: Rocky Mountain Way . Joe Walsh . What do you want from me , it 's a fucking ipod .
FBI FORENSIC: Blood stain . Few fibers . That 's it .
CONVICT: Warden , man , whassup ?
IGER: Everybody back to sleep .
NICK: I want to see him .
CLYDE: You 're up early . Trouble sleeping ?
NICK: It was a good bluff . But you 're
CLYDE: Amazing , is n't it ? How primal that is . That pull ? What a man is capable
NICK: Good night , Ben .
CLYDE: Good night , Nick .
SARAH: We dug pretty deep for one night . Still got a ways to go , but on a first look ? Nothing . Nada . Zip .
IGER: Well , that 's good news .
DAVIES: Fellas . For once , glad not to be of assistance .
DUNNIGAN: Love it when they cry wolf .
DAVIES: Each car had an explosive charge on the gas tank .
NICK: He 's got someone working with him . On the outside . He 's got to .
DAVIES: Not necessarily . Everything looks pre-rigged .
BOMB EXPERT: We found a short-range transmitte eacon buried outside the prison wall . When your people showed up here and drove in through the gate ,
DUNNIGAN: He could have planted those bombs a month ago .
CANTRELL: Nono , we 've got two dozen ADAs on payroll . Those eight were picked last night on the spur of the moment . How could he know which eight would show up ?
DAVIES: He did n't . Our people just found ombs on every car in your ADA pool . All two dozen . We 're disarming those now .
CLYDE: I want a phone in my cell . If I 'm conducting my own defense , it would e useful . Also in case you and I need to be in touch , Nick .
NICK: Fuck you .
CLYDE: Your twenty four hours are about up . In return for the phone , I 'll extend you another twelve hours .
NICK: If not ?
CLYDE: How many more people die while you stand around dithering ? How many do you get killed before my point starts sinking in ? Cantrell closes in , tracking Clyde by voice
CANTRELL: Motherfucker ! Whatever point you had was lost long ago ! Eight kids dead in that yard , most of them just out of college ! Eight ! I have to talk to their families . I have to try to explain why their loved ones are dead .
CLYDE: I 've been waiting for my explanation for ten years . So far
DUNNIGAN: Maybe I got a better idea . Maybe we end this war right now .
GARZA: Jesus Christ , man , dial it back
CLYDE: Do it . It would be decisive . Stupid , ut decisive . Can you handle the blowback , Detective ? The `` shit like that ? ''
NICK: Put the gun away ! Are you crazy ?
DUNNIGAN: It 's an option . All I 'm saying . Risk the blowback . Ride it out .
NICK: We 're not risking anything . O letting him tear us down . You 're not getting us to throw out the rules , like you . No way .
CLYDE: I like rules . I 've wanted you to follow them from the start . Like the one that says you prosecute a man who murders my family . So . Rules . A phone buys you anothe twelve hours . But if you have n't cut my deal and let me go by the deadline
NICK: What ? What then ?
CLYDE: I 'll kill someone in this room .
NICK: Who ?
CLYDE: Eeniemeeniemineymoe
CANTRELL: Who 's he pointing at ?
CANTRELL: Point taken .
DAVIES: We 'll give him his phone . We 'll tap in and monitor every call .
DUNNIGAN: Buys us another twelve hours , we could use that right now . That puts the deadline at about 7 30 tonight .
CANTRELL: Shit . I 'll be in front of a room full of lawyers . The A.B.A . dinner . I 'm the keynote speaker .
NICK: No way . Find a replacement .
DUNNIGAN: Until his deadline passes , you 're in protective custody . Not negotiable . Cantrell is n't happy about it but nods .
NICK: And have them switch the location of that dinner .
CANTRELL: That 's last minute .
NICK: Exactly . He could have gotten you schedule in advance been planning to take you out at the dinner along with everybody else . That eenie- meenie act could have been horseshit . We have to get a few moves ahead . Plan for every contingency .
DUNNIGAN: This way , Mr. Cantrell . Garza , you 're with Mr. Price .
NICK: Hey baby no , I 'm fine . Really . Honey , calm down
BOMB EXPERT: You 're good . Car 's been swept .
NICK: Of course it has . Thanks .
GARZA: Go around . I 'll get us in back .
NICK: Any word ?
KELL: She 's in surgery now . They 're saying she 'll be okay .
NICK: Thank God . That 's good .
KELL: Good ? You 'll have to explain the good part , Nick . I 'm missing it . This is crazy . What if something happened to you ? What would I say to Emma ? What would we do ?
NICK: You did n't lose me . You wo n't . Does the school know we 're pulling Emma out of class ?
KELL: I called , yeah , but I 'd rathe e here for Sarah when she wakes up . Nick and for you . I want to do something
NICK: You are . Getting our daughter out of harm 's way . And yourself . Detective . Will you escort my wife , please ? There 's not much time . I 'll be there to see you off . Okay ? Please ?

ROYCE: What do you want me to tell the mayor ?

EMMA: This sucks .
NICK: I know .
EMMA: Why do we have to go ?
NICK: 'Cause your mom wants to see a few Broadway shows . You gon na begrudge her that ?
EMMA: You 're kinda full of shit , Dad .

EMMA: Okay .
NICK: No credit cards . Too easy to track . Meals , hotel , whatever pay cash .
KELL: Anything else ?
NICK: I love you .
KELL: Emma 's right . This sucks .
CANTRELL: Nick ? These guys wo n't even let me pack a bag . Not even a toothbrush .
DAVIES: We have granules of an unidentified substance in the ice-maker
TECH #1: Like this salt . Not sodium chloride . Potassium chloride . It 's a neuro-blocker , stops the heart they use it in lethal injections . You 'd be dead
NICK: I 'm telling you , Clyde has someone * working with him . Someone on the outside .
CANTRELL: Who ? Who could he have ?
NICK: Somebody from his past . Could be * that spook we met on the stairs , * for all we know he 'd know how to * plant this shit
CANTRELL: Him ? Nowhy would Clyde let him come talk to us ?
NICK: To fuck with our heads ? To get us to bring in our ADAs so he could low them up ?
DUNNIGAN: It would be a Clyde move . But it 's * not proof . * Could he have planted this stuff in * your house before he was arrested ?
CANTRELL: II do n't know
NICK: Jonas , think last few days , have * you used any ice ? Any salt ?
CANTRELL: I do n't use saltmy cholesterol . Ice ? Yeahnot long ago .
NICK: Before or after he was arrested ?
CANTRELL: I do n't remember ! You track your * use of ice , Nick ? You keep a daily * log ? TECH # 2 calls from the kitchen
TECH #2: Heads-up ! Looks like polonium here . In his tea pot . Same way the Russians killed Litvenenko . Took him two weeks to die . It 's an exotic isotope . All you need is a trace amount . Rips through your organs and bone marrow .
CANTRELL: Nice ?
DAVIES: I 'm actually a little jealous Clyde did n't pick me .
DUNNIGAN: It 's the presidential suite . Last person who stayed here was actually a president . Of a country . Security here is amazing .
NICK: It 's not bad , Jonas . I think you can muddle through .
DAVIES: You 're muddling with him . I do n't want you back at your house until my people sweep it . You need pajamas , uy some in the shop downstairs .
NICK: The background check my office was
CANTRELL: Fellas I 'm grateful for all you efforts . I just wanted to say it .
NICK: Save it for tonight . Hope you 're in the mood for Chinese takeout .
CANTRELL: Where are you going ?
NICK: That stuff in your house it 's all gone too far . I started this . I owe everybody at least one last try at defusing it .
CLYDE: Interesting location you 've chosen .
NICK: I thought we 'd have some privacy .
CLYDE: For what ? A talk ? Or Maybe you 've decided to take Detective Dunnigan 's advice .
NICK: Be the perfect place for it . Outside the wall . Look like you were shot trying to escape .
CLYDE: You have some kind of signal worked out ? You scratch your nose and blam , I 'm a goner ?
NICK: Something like that .
CLYDE: Might solve all your problems . What 's stopping you ? Afraid of the blowback ?
NICK: No . It 's to prove a point . Just because I have the power , does n't mean I have to use it .
CLYDE: Ah . Nice . Good one .
NICK: One can show mercy .
CLYDE: Mercy . Right .
NICK: Yeah . So why do n't you ?
CLYDE: I think we 've come a little too fa for that , have n't we , Nick ? I mean , what do I say ? Sorry , my bad ? Which way to the execution chamber ?
NICK: Do n't give me that . Death does n't scare you .
CLYDE: Yeah , butwe 're in the flow of this now . You cry havoc , you let
NICK: Until one side admits defeat . What if I did that ? What if I said you were right . I was wrong . What if I say I should have prosecuted both men ten years ago ?
CLYDE: I 'd say you 're making progress . You should have , you know . Prosecuted oth .
NICK: I 'd have lost .
CLYDE: With your head held high . And without any blame from me . Nick 's CELL RINGS he turns away , answers
NICK: Yeah She is ? Great news . I 'll stop on my way back . And Royce ? Put some get- well flowers in her room , they sell 'em in the lobby . Thanks . Six hours in surgery .
CLYDE: But she 's okay good . Miss Lowell is a fine young woman . Oh , heyyour wife and little girl get out of town all right ?
NICK: You asking that question makes me want to scratch my nose .
CLYDE: Just a guess . It 's what I would do . Get 'em out , make sure they 're safe . C'mon . Like I 'd ever have hurt them anyway .
NICK: No ?
CLYDE: There are limits . Even in war . I may be many things , Nick . But I 'm not Clarence Darby . I 'm not Rupert Ames . I 'm not that kind of monster .
NICK: What kind are you ?
CLYDE: Not the kind who 'd hurt your wife and child . Christ , look at me . Mine were my salvation then they were killed and all I had left was this . Life without them in this fucking charnel-house world . Pause . Drawing close
NICK: Yeah .
CLYDE: Imagine knowing they would n't .
NICK: I wo n't make any more deals with murderers . If hearing that makes a differenceif that was the point of all thisyou 've won .
CLYDE: Counselor . I have no doubt , as we stand here , that you really believe that . I wish I could . Are we done ? You gon na scratch you nose , or can I go ?
SECRETARY: Judge 's chambers .

JUDGE BURCH: Jonas was upset not to be here with you tonighta personal matte came upbut he wanted me to give you all his fondest regards
CANTRELL: There . That 's better .
GARZA: Jesus Christ . What the fuck hit us ?
MAYOR: We 're worldwide news this morning . Almost twenty dead , among them some of this country 's top attorneys . I had friends in that room . Hell , I almost attended myself .
DUNNIGAN: not entirely fair
MAYOR: Detective . Your job is hanging by a thread . I 'd think a man of you experience would know when to keep his mouth shut and his ass covered .
NICK: How 'd you kill Jonas ? I know about the second explosion , I saw the contrail , so I know you got somebody working for you . But the first explosion how ?
CLYDE: Say you find a guy with a bad cocaine problem . Hungry ex-wives . Greedy
NICK: It wasinside the dog ?
CLYDE: You own the vet , you own the dog . Explosive was n't even that big . Stuff I use , it did n't have to be . Hidden in plain sight . That 's my specialty . Have n't you figured that out yet ?
NICK: I 'm trying to get over my friend eing dead . Aside from that , fuck you .
CLYDE: Fair enough . I 'll miss you Nick . It was a good dance .
NICK: Did n't bring your family back , though , did it ? Has it made you feel better ? All this ? You done making your point ?

SARAH: We got the latest batch of background in . Hansen and the other guy did some good work here
NICK: Sarah . Give it a rest . It 's over . We 're done . I 'm done . The mayor is nailing my coffin shut . The best thing you can do right now is distance yourself from me as much as you can see what you can salvage of your career .
SARAH: This lists over fifty shit-value properties in industrial zones that nobody in their right mind would want to own stuff around chemical plants , factories . All are owned by Benson Clyde . Look at twenty-two . Nick , not caring , scans down to
NICK: `` Joe 's Lube-and-Drive Garage . '' Went out of business in '94 . Now why would Joe 's extinct Lube- and-Shit Garage be of the slightest possible fucking interest to you , me , or anyone ?
SARAH: The garage , not so much . But the address . Look at the location .
DUNNIGAN: Dunnigan .
NICK: Do we finish this tonight ?
DUNNIGAN: Nick ? Jesus Look . No hard feelings , but there
NICK: I know who he 's got on the outside . I 'll ask again . Do we finish this tonight ?

CLYDE: Tedhad to get that vacation in . Visited my sister in the Keys
SECURITY GUARD: Nice . Good for you .

SECURITY GUARD: Mayor 's got a big fuckin ' thing . Thousand dollar a plate whatever . They say the Governor might come .
CLYDE: I 'll stay out of their way .
SECURITY GUARD: They 're up on six , avoid that floor . They got more security than God
DUNNIGAN: What floor ?
SECURITY GUARD: I told him to avoid six There
NICK: That 's right below the ballroom . The Mayor 's event .
TAC LEADER: Subject in sight . Do we take him ?
NICK: No . Let him go . We know where to find him . Let 's get to that courtroom .

NICK: There .
DAVIES: Do n't touch it ! Could be motion sensitive !
DAVIES: C-4 is for girl scouts . This is malglinite . Take out the whole floo above usmaybe this entire corne of the building
NICK: Can you open it ? Disarm it ?
DAVIES: No , we got tripwires . We open this lid , instant karma 's gon na get us . Do n't see a motion sensor . Trigge looks simpledial a cell phone , incoming call arms the trigger trigger 's set to count down from forty seconds , then boom . That call comes in , we have forty seconds to get as far away from this thing as possible .
NICK: No !

NICK: He wo n't set it off until that room is full ! People are still arriving , ed carpet shit , that 's at least another half hour !

NICK: Been thinking . If I 'd done things differently made different decisions from the start we would n't have gotten to this point .
CLYDE: But it happened . And here we are .
NICK: Here we are . Your decisions put us here too .
CLYDE: You want to hold hands ? What 's you point ?
NICK: We ca n't change decisions we 've made . We can only account fo decisions we make from here . I know what mine will be . What about you ? You gon na finish dialing that number , or what ?
CLYDE: If I do n't ? What are you offering ?
NICK: You looking to deal ?
CLYDE: I 'm willing to listen .
NICK: Okay , here 's the deal . The deal isthere is no deal . I told you . No more deals with murderers . I 'm sticking to that .
CLYDE: I 'm sorry .

BEN: Are you working ?
SERA: Working ? What do you mean , working ? I 'm walking .
BEN: That 's funny . I wonder if you 'll take two hundred and fifty dollars to fuck me ?
SERA: Maybe you should n't stand in the road like that . You 're pretty drunk .
BEN: Not really . My room 's not far . The Whole Year Inn . You can drive with me if you want
SERA: Why do n't you give me the money when I 'm in the car , and I 'll drive you .

BEN: Sarah - with an H ?
SERA: No - S.E.R.A .
BEN: We can go to one if you 'd prefer .
SERA: No , this is fine . I was just wondering .
BEN: Well I 'm here because I 'm a drunk who tends to pass out at odd hours fo unpredictable stretches . I 'm going to a hotel soon . A room with a balcony to pass out on or off .
SERA: Umm . We can stay in the ca for an hour if you want . But I really have to go then . It 's your time .
BEN: Right , I 'll get your door . I tend to fade in and out lately .
SERA: I guess I do too .
BEN: You what ?
SERA: I sometimes fade out .
BEN: Oh well , maybe we bette synchronize our spells o stagger them .
SERA: You were going to get my door .
BEN: Do you think so ?
SERA: Mind if I use the bathroom ?
BEN: Of course .
SERA: For two-fifty we can do pretty much what you want . You 've been drinking , so it might be better if I got on top , but the other way 's fine too . I have some jelly in case you want to fuck my ass , that 's up to you . If you want to come in my face , that 's OK too , just try to keep it out of my hair , I just washed it and my eyes , it stings .
BEN: Maybe another drink first . More tequila ?
SERA: OK whatever .
BEN: I do n't care about that . There 's time left . You can have more money . You can drink all you want . You can talk or listen . Just stay , that 's all I want .
SERA: So , Ben , what brings you to Las Vegas ? Business convention ?
BEN: No , I came here to drink myself you know
SERA: To death ?
BEN: Yes , that 's right .
SERA: How long 's it gon na take , fo you to drink yourself to death ?
BEN: I think about four weeks , and I 've got enough for about two hundred and fifty to three hundred dollars a day .
SERA: Yes that should do it . What am I ? A luxury ?
BEN: Yeah . And your meter just ran out .
SERA: It 's OK nice watch . Go on . Talk some more .
BEN: In LA I kept running out of ooze and the store would be closed because I 'd forget to look at my watch so I decided to move here because nothing ever closes and ecause I got tired of getting funny looks when I would walk into a bar at six o'clock even the bartenders started preaching . Here , everyone 's from out of town so no one cares , no one is overtly fucking up
YURI: Where have you been ?
SERA: It was a slow night . I went to a hotel for a few drinks .
YURI: A full night on the street and this is all ?
SERA: Like I said it was a slow night I 'm sorry . It was hard to score .
YURI: What do you think you are sixteen years old on Hollywood Boulevard ?
SERA: Maybe nobody wants to fuck a chick with a cut on he cheek .
YURI: I could kill you . You know that .
SERA: I will Yuri . I will .
CONVENTIONEER: About ready for anothe drink ?
SERA: Yes , that would be great . Are you her for the convention ?
CONVENTIONEER: Do I look that obvious ? My name 's Paul .
SERA: No , of course not , just a wild guess . I 'm Sera and that 's a margarita .
CONVENTIONEER: Alone . Alone . I 'm here alone .
SERA: Where are you staying ?
CONVENTIONEER: Right here at the hotel . Why ?
SERA: Well I thought you might be looking for a date .
CONVENTIONEER: A date . What , are you a hooker ? What do you mean a date ? I 've got a wife back home . I just came over to talk for a few minutes .
SERA: I 'm sorry , I guess I misunderstood .
CONVENTIONEER: Sorry . Look you seem like a nice girl . I 'm just sick of everyone in this town trying to get my money .
BARMAN: Maybe you should give it a miss for this evening .
BEN: I could n't remember what happened last time . I was afraid that I might have been ude , or mean to you .
SERA: No , just drunk but that 's OK. Where 's your car ?
BEN: I sold it this morning . I 'm going to take cabs from now on in .
SERA: Why should I ? I know you 're not a cop , so what is it tonight ? Another two-fifty to watch you sleep ?
BEN: I was looking for you tonight . I do n't know if you have a boyfriend
SERA: Are you serious .
BEN: I think you know I 'm serious . I 'll pay you if you like but I 'd like to see you .
SERA: No , I ca n't have dinner with you .
YURI: Sera ! It 's
SERA: Sorry , Yuri good night lots of tricks I think things are picking up .
YURI: Have you told anyone that I 'm here ?
SERA: No .
YURI: Do you here that ?
SERA: Yuri are you
YURI: Sera please go .
BEN: No thanks I 'm fine .
SERA: Still want to have dinner ?
BEN: Yes .
SERA: I have to change and take a shower first . If you want to come home and wait .
BEN: You do ?
SERA: You OK ?
BEN: Of course . Wow you look extremely beautiful .
SERA: Thank you . What time is it ?
BEN: Do n't know . My watch went the way of the car .
SERA: I like hearing you talk . If you feel up to a short walk , there 's a place to eat around the corner . All the food in Vegas is terrible so the place does n't really matter . How does that sound to you ?
BEN: Do they have drinks ?
SERA: I 'm from the East . I went to college , did an arts course . I now live in Vegas . I think of it as home . I came here deliberately to carve out a life . I was in LA before , but I 'll come back to that later . The tough times are behind me now . I can deal with the bad things that happen . There will always be dark characters . But my life is good . It is as I would want it to be . So , why are you a drunk ?
BEN: Is that really what you want to ask me ?
SERA: Yes .
BEN: Well , then I guess this is our first date or our last . Until now , I was n't sure it was either .
SERA: Very clever .
BEN: Interesting choice of words . I do n't remember . I just know that I want to .
SERA: Want to kill yourself ? Are you saying that you 're drinking as a way to kill yourself ?
BEN: Or killing myself as a way to drink .
SERA: Ben , why do n't you stay at my place tonight ? I mean look , you 're so drunk . I like you . I trust you .
BEN: That 's astonishing . Sera , look
SERA: I hate to think of you in that cheesy motel . I mean
BEN: I 'm going to move to a smart hotel , tomorrow if it 'll make you feel better . Let 's talk about tomorrow . Wan na do something ?
SERA: Sure tonight . Then please stay at my place .
BEN: Sera you know I 'm not much good in the sack .
SERA: It 's not about sex , Ben . I 'll make you up a bed on the sofa . Do it for me . We can talk till late and then sleep till late . As you know , I am my own boss .
BEN: How long have I been her ?
SERA: Three nights , two days . When is your rent coming up at the motel ?
BEN: I do n't know . I 'll go and sort it out today . Why do n't you come ? We 'll find a real oom for me . You can pick it out , a tower on the strip .
SERA: There 's no reason to blow all your money on a hotel room .
BEN: What do you mean ?
SERA: What I mean is that you should bring your stuff ove here . We 're spending all this time together what the fuck !
BEN: Sera
SERA: Let 's face it , Ben , we 're having fun here . I 've neve done so much talking in my life .
BEN: Me neither .
SERA: So ! Let 's dispense with the formalities . I want you here now !
BEN: Sera you are crazy .
SERA: So I 'm not too concerned with long term plans .
BEN: Do n't you think you 'll get a little bored living with a drunk ?
SERA: That is what I want . Why do n't you go and get you stuff ?
BEN: You have n't seen the worst of it . These last few days I 've een very controlled . I knock things over I throw up all the time . Now I feel really good You 're like some kind of antidote that mixes the liquor and keeps me in alance , but that wo n't last forever . You 'll get tired of it really quickly . Believe me .
SERA: OK , you go back to your hotel and I 'll go back to my glamorous life of being alone .
BEN: Do n't be silly ?
SERA: We got ta decide this right now . Before we go any further . You either stay here with me or
BEN: Sera what you do n't understand is
SERA: What ?
BEN: You can never never ask me to stop drinking . Do you understand ?
SERA: I do . I really do . OK . I have to do some shopping alone . You go out for a few drinks and then pick up your things . Do n't hurry and I 'll be back before you to let you in .
BEN: Maybe this is n't a good idea after all .
HUSBAND: We did n't know whether to call the police or not .
WIFE: He 's been there for about half an hour . My husband thought he 'd seen you two together , but I thought it est to wait until you got home .
SERA: Yes , he 's my friend . I guess he just had a little too much to drink . I 'll help him inside . Thanks for the concern . Sorry to trouble you .
HUSBAND: Well , call me if there 's anything I can do .
SERA: Can you wake up ?
BEN: Hi !
SERA: Why do n't you go in and sit down . I have some gifts fo you .
BEN: Right OK
SERA: Do n't worry I got'em .
BEN: Of course .
SERA: Gift number one .
BEN: I used to carry a lot of keys , but one by one they all fell victim to the great condensation . Now I have just this one which is
SERA: Ben ?
BEN: Sorry .
SERA: OK .
BEN: I 've come this far here I am , in your house . I want you to let me pay the rent fo this month . All right ?
SERA: Why ?
BEN: Because it 's better for me that way . OK ?
SERA: Well OK
BEN: Sera I hope that you understand how I feel about this . First of all , you 're welcome to my money . We can uy a couple of cases of liquor and you can have the est . But I do n't think you 're talking to me right now about money .
SERA: No ?
BEN: No . I think you 're talking about you . I 'll tell you ight now that I 'm in love with you but , be that as it may , I 'm not here to force my twisted life into your soul .
SERA: I know that
BEN: and I 'm not here to demand your attention to the point where it changes your life . We know I 'm a drunk but that seems to be all right with you . And I know that you 're a hooker . I hope you understand that I 'm a person who is totally at ease with this which is not to say that I 'm indifferent or that I do n't care I do it simply means that I trust and accept your judgement . What I 'm saying is that I hope you understand that I understand .
SERA: Thanks , I do understand . I was worried about how that would be but now I 'm not . And you should know that included with the rent here is a complimentary blow job .
BEN: Ah , yes I suppose sooner o later we ought to fuck .
SERA: Whatever that means . Open your presents .
BEN: Very nice .
SERA: Right the suitcase was clinking . So what did you do with your clothes ?
BEN: I threw them into the garbage. , which was perhaps immoral , but I wanted to come to you clean , so to speak . I thought we could go shopping and pick up a pair of jeans and forty-five pairs of underwear and just throw them out each day .
SERA: Nice talk , Ben . Keep drinking . In between the hundred and one proof breath and the occasional drool , some interesting words fall from your mouth .
BEN: Well looks like I 'm with the right girl .
SERA: Do you want to go gambling tonight ? We could go out and play for a few hours .
BEN: I had n't planned to gamble but if you would keep the bulk of my money here , then I could safely low a couple of hundred ucks .
SERA: Then come . I 'm going to change . Watch TV . I 'll be half an hour .
BEN: When ?
SERA: Tomorrow night as a matter of fact .
BEN: I like your earrings .
SERA: Well , then I hope we do n't un into any tonight .
BEN: What do you mean ?
SERA: I expect some kind of loyalty here . Just because I fuck fo money does n't give you cause to start picking up women and leaving me looking silly .
BEN: And I only have eyes for you . And we both know that you would never become omantically involved with a trick , right ?
SERA: I love you .
BEN: Very well umm I neve expected to have to ask you this again but how did ou evening go ? I remembe getting to the casino I emember kissing you that was really nice but everything after that is a lank .
SERA: Well - I was prepared fo worse , but it was n't so bad . We were sitting at the bar , talking about blackjack . You seemed just fine , a little drunker than usual , but nothing really strange , but then your head started to droop and I put my arm on your shoulder and then , wham , you swung you arm at me , and fell backwards off your stool into a cocktail waitress . You smashed everything on he tray , it was a real mess . You kept yelling and yelling .
BEN: Oh , and what did you do ?
SERA: I tried to shut you up and help you to your feet but you kept swinging at me - not like you wanted to hit me , ut more just waving me away . Security came and when you saw them you stopped yelling . They wanted to carry you out and dump you on the street , ut I talked them into letting me walk you out .
BEN: That 's impressive . How did you do that ?
SERA: I told them you were an alcoholic and T would take you home . I also promised that we would never come in there again .
BEN: We ?
SERA: Yes , we .
BEN: What happened then ?
SERA: You were OK for a while , so we walked for about a block and then you said you wanted to go home and fuck , but I think even you knew that was n't going to happen . We got a cab and you asked him to stop at a liquor store , even though I told you that we had plenty at home . In the store you gave the kid a hundred and told him to keep the change . I asked you if you knew it was a hundred . You said you did , so I let you do it . We got here , you fell asleep on the couch and I covered you up and came to ed .
BEN: I warned you but I 'm sorry .
SERA: Here 's my speech I know this should n't be acceptable to m , but it is . Do n't ask me why . I sense that your trouble is very ig and I 'm scared fo you and so I 'm doing what I think you need me to do . Falling down in casinos is little stuff . It does n't other me . It has nothing to do with us .
BEN: That 's amazing . What are you ? Some sort of angel visiting me from one of my drunk fantasies ? How can you be so good ?
SERA: I do n't know what you 're saying . I 'm just using you . I need you . Can we not talk about it any more , please . Not another word .
BEN: Why do n't you go back to sleep . I 'll go out and buy us some breakfast .
SERA: Be careful .
BEN: Do n't worry .
SERA: Ben , I 'm working tonight .
BEN: I know .
BARTENDER: Sure thing . Anything to eat ?
BEN: Not quite yet . First I have to drink myself sober , then a few crackers , maybe an egg and toast
BIKER GIRL: Who the fuck are you talking to , Mr ? Why are you all dressed up , honey ? My , do n't you look fine .
BEN: Do you mind if I buy her a drink ?
BIKER: Fuck her . I do n't care what the fuck you do with her .
BEN: Maybe I could buy you both a drink ?
BIKER: Fuck you . Do n't fuck with me , motherfucker . Fuck off . Go to it , she 's waiting for he drink .
BIKER GIRL: See what an asshole he is . I 'll have a rum and Coke .
BEN: Barman ? A rum and Coke , please .
BIKER GIRL: Can I stay with you for a while ?
BEN: You mean move in with me ? Is n't this a bit sudden ?
BIKER GIRL: Oh , I do n't have a lot of stuff .
BEN: I do n't think my wife would dig it too much .
BIKER GIRL: Maybe we could just go find a oom and fuck all day . You would n't have to tell you wife about that , would you ? I could suck you like this .
BEN: See , the thing is fucking you would be wonderful , but I am deeply in love with Sera
BIKER: Now listen , asshole , I 'm not gon na just sit around and watch her suck on your ear .
BIKER GIRL: Get lost , jerk .
BIKER: What do you say ?
BEN: I 'm sorry but she and I have decided to spend a few hours together in a mo -
BARTENDER: You 're quite a fighter .
BEN: I 'm back .
SERA: Oh , no ! Oh , fuck , Ben , look at your face . You get in a fight ? I thought you did n't fight . Goddammit . How do you feel ? Wait here . Sit down .
BEN: Absolutely not ow I was defending the honor of some poor wayward maiden .
SERA: Why do n't you go and finish this in the bathroom . Take a shower and put on your othe shirt . I 'll fix breakfast and then we 'll go shopping and get some new clothes . I think this suit must be unlucky .
BEN: OK , but remember that they wear it because they have to . I wear it because I want to . That 'll make me look different . Let 's get a drink .
SERA: Ben ?
BEN: There was no time for me to write a card , with you eathing down my neck all day. , so you 'll just have to wing it , baby .
SERA: Your color .
BEN: I think you should wear one at a time . One of these and one of your others . In fact , I was going to buy just one , ut I did n't think it would fly as a gift , I mean .
SERA: I 'll wear them tonight one of them .
BEN: Yes tonight . Put it on .
SERA: Ben , wait please wait fo me .
MAN: Maybe you should wait fo her , sir .
BEN: Why ?
MAN: Because you can hear in he voice that she really wants you to .
SERA: What was that all about ?
BEN: Can we just forget it ?
SERA: I do n't understand any of that .
BEN: Can we just ignore it ?
SERA: Yes I 'll give you that .
BEN: Thank you , Sera .
SERA: Do you want me not to go tonight ?
BEN: No we already talked about that .
SERA: They would n't know .
BEN: You be careful to . I 'm going to miss you .
SERA: Shall we go away for a couple of days ?
BEN: Yeah I 'd like that .
SERA: Do n't do that to me . Do n't frighten me like that .
BEN: Last spring I happened to walk past a house that I had once patronized . There was a cool breeze blowing off the ocean and through the window I could see a bare leg . The girl must have been taking a eak between customers . It was a strange moment for me ecause it reminded me of my mother and despite the fact that I was late for something already I just stayed there , loving the atmosphere of it and my memory and the eason I 'm telling you this epilogue is that I felt that I 'd come full circle .
SERA: Where was that house ? The one in LA , I mean .
BEN: Fifth and Mayflower . You know it ?
SERA: Yes . One of my friends was there . I wonder if you eve clipped her .
BEN: I like it here with you .
SERA: Let 's stay for a while .
BEN: OK .
SERA: I 've missed the best sun . Why did you have to pawn you watch ?
BEN: I did n't know I 'd ever need it again .
SERA: Maybe we should go inside . Come on .
BEN: Whoops .
SERA: Yes , fine . Do n't worry . We 'll pay for the chair , and I 'll clean all this up , the pool too .
BEN: Sera ?
SERA: I 'm in here . You probably do n't want to hear about it ight now , but I bought some plain rice . I thought it might be something you could eat . So if you get hungry later on , just let me know .
BEN: I think I 'm ready for the ice !
SERA: You 're pretty sick .
BEN: Sera I 'm not going to see a doctor .
SERA: And do what rot away in a oom ? We 're not going to talk about that . Fuck you ! I will not talk about that . You 're staying here . You are not moving to a hotel .
BEN: Will you lighten up , please ?
SERA: One thing one thing this is one thing you can do fo me . I 've given you gallons of free will here ! You can do this for me .
BLONDE: Hey that was quite a play . You in for the convention ?
BEN: I 'd like to fuck you .
BLONDE: I 'm very expensive .
BEN: How much to lick your pussy ?
SERA: There are limits .
BEN: Yes I guess I knew that .
SERA: Sorry , guys , but I do n't know what you mean . Anyway , I never date more than one guy at a time .
VOICE: Go on fuck her ass
OTHER VOICE: Look at me look at me look at me .
CAB DRIVER: What 's the matter , honey , get a back-door delivery you were n't expecting ? You gon na e able to pay the fare ?

WOMAN'S VOICE: When I was a little girl , my mothe would remind me each night before ed to be sure to open my heart to God , for he was kind , merciful and just . Things changed after my father left a few years later , leaving her to raise me and my others alone in a little place out on the edge of the Mojave Desert . She never talked about a kind and merciful God again . Instead she spoke of a prophecy . Of a time when all the world would e covered in darkness and the fate of Mankind would be decided . One night I finally got up the courage to ask my mother why God had changed , why was he mad at his children . `` I do n't know , '' she said , tucking the covers around me , `` I guess he just got tired of all the bullshit . ''

HOWARD: I do n't know . Why do n't we just ask her ?
SANDRA: Howard , do n't . You 'll embarrass me .
HOWARD: ( shouting across the
DINER: Audrey , honey ? Your mother was wondering if you got dressed this morning with the specific intention of showing your ass off to the entire world ?
AUDREY: Yeah , that 's cuz I woke up hoping to get double teamed by a couple of meth head truckers in the bathroom of some desert shithole .
BEAT: Good thing we stopped here .
HOWARD: I feel satisfied with that answer . I really do . Sandra buries her face in her hands .
SANDRA: I 'm being punished for something , I know it .
KYLE: Shit
CHARLIE: Guess I should think ` bout quittin ' then .
KYLE: Now hold on , girl , let me bum one efore you do .
CHARLIE: You can buy a whole pack inside .
KYLE: Tell ya what . You let me have one of yours , and I 'll give you two from the new pack you 're gon na sell me .
CHARLIE: Only if nowhere 's right , ` cause that 's where you are .

KYLE: I can handle that . You got pancakes here ?
CHARLIE: Yeah , we got a buttermilk stack fo three seventy-five . We also got french toast for four dollars if you 're into that . I personally like the pancakes though .
KYLE: Three seventy-five , huh ?
CHARLIE: I hope Salem Lights are okay , ` cause that 's all we got left .
KYLE: If I can smoke ` em , I 'll take ` em .
BOB: This ai n't a resort you know . I got orders stacking up here .

BOB: What ? I quit two years ago .

BOB: It was a gift from my ex-wife , alright ? I 'm sentimental . I do n't wan na forget how much I hate he guts .
KYLE: Hey man ?
HOWARD: Any news about when our truck might e fixed ? You said your boy would have us on the road two hours ago . The rate we 're going , we 'll be lucky to make it to Scottsdale by Christmas . Bob 's expression darkens at this news .
BOB: Goddamn it . Where the hell is Jeep ?
JEEP: Yeah
JEEP: Nothin ' Jeep tries feebly to block his path , fails . Bob looks down at the crib with dismay .
BOB: Whaddya doin ' ?
JEEP: What ?
BOB: Jeep , I like Charlie . I do . And I think it 's real good of you to lend her a helping hand , but she is not your responsibility .
JEEP: Oh whatever , leave me alone .
BOB: Do n't walk away from me while I 'm talkin ' to you !
JEEP: Do n't say that about her ! She 's not like that !
BOB: You really think she 's gon na stick around here after that baby 's born and off her hands ? Jeeps shakes his head , burns .
JEEP: Look , I know it does n't make any sense to you , but it 's just something I have to do . Bob sighs , feels for his boy .
BOB: See that up there ? Your mothe thought I was crazy for wanting to uy this place , middle of nowhereBut I just knew this was what I was supposed to do . Told your mom , `` just wait . '' Told he when they finally ran the freeway through here like they were plannin ' on , this place would be like Grand Central Station .
BEAT: But I was wrong . The freeway neve came and now the only people who ever stop here are the ones who are lost .
JEEP: C'mon Dad . You ca n't blame yourself for what she did
BOB: Yeah , I can . And I 'm sayin ' you 're about to make the same damn mistake I made , believing in something that 's never gon na happenO someone .
BEAT: It 's time for you to move on from this place , Jeep . I do n't wan na see you wake up one morning old and pissed off , realizing you 're lost just like everybody else who stops here .
BOB: Now get to work on that truck . I wan na have these people on the road y nightfall . Bob walks back into the diner .
HAND: Yeah , wait a minute .
BOB: What 's wrong with you today ?
PERCY: I told you to get the satellite TV . But you do n't wan na listen .
BOB: What the hell do I need that crap for ?
PERCY: History Channel , man !
BOB: I got all the history I can take .
CHARLIE: That 's for sure .
BOB: What 's your problem now ?
CHARLIE: Where do I start ?
BOB: You know this was the top-of-the- line model when I bought it .
CHARLIE: Yeah , in the Fifties .
BOB: You should n't be watchin ' anyways . Okay , baby , this is gon na do it . Bob gives the TV one final wallop WHACK !
PERCY: Nice work , Bob . What the hell 's that ?
BOB: It 's just one of those test things .
CHARLIE: Do n't look like a test .
KYLE: Yo , am I the Invisible motherfuckin ' Man here ? Do you have a phone or not ?
BOB: In the back past the kitchen . Make it fast . Kyle hustles passed Percy .
SANDRA: If there 's a real emergency are n't they supposed to give us some information about what to do ?
HOWARD: I 'm sure it 's a mistake .
BOB: Hey , Percy , give that old radio of yours a shot . Maybe they got some news about the TV .
HEARD: Wait You 're breakin ' up . Hello ? Shit !
KYLE: What the hell He keeps trying . Nothing .
HOWARD: They keep sayin ' we 're overdue fo a big one .
PERCY: Lot a folks could be hurt .
BOB: Not if it was centered in the desert .
HOWARD: Exactly . Could be nothing to worry about .
SANDRA: So then why 's the TV out ?
HOWARD: Maybe it just hit the relay stations . Are n't those usually in emote areas ?
BOB: Yeah , ` cause of the radiation they give off .
PERCY: There ai n't no radiation comin ' from those things . Plus that do n't explain the radio being out too . Some of those stations broadcast over hundreds of miles . Any quake that big and we would a felt it .
CHARLIE: Percy 's right . I did n't feel nothing .
AUDREY: Maybe it 's a terrorist attack o something ?
SANDRA: Oh god Everyone considers that grimly , then
BOB: Well , for cryin ' out loud . There 's no use in speculating . I 'll just call my brother up in Needles . He must a heard something .
KYLE: Phone 's dead . Just tried to make a call .
BOB: You 're shittin ' me .
SANDRA: Oh , this is just great .
BOB: Relax , Mrs. Anderson . Nothing to get excited about . Probably just working on the lines .
JEEP: Damn it !
CHARLIE: Have a seat wherever you want , Ma'am . Specials are on the board .

OLD WOMAN: Hello , I 'm Gladys . Gladys Foster .
SANDRA: Nice to meet you , Gladys . I 'm Sandra and this is my husband Howard .
GLADYS: What a nice young couple you are . What brings you out to these parts ?
SANDRA: We 're moving out to Scottsdale . But our truck broke down , and so we 're stuck here while it 's being fixed .
GLADYS: Oh , what a nuisance .
SANDRA: Say , Gladys , it seems the lines are down around here . The phone and TV , you know ?
GLADYS: Oh , do n't worry yourself about that , sweetheart . It 'll all be over soon .
JEEP: The carburetor 's shot . Do n't know why . Looks brand new .
BOB: ( glances over at the
ANDERSONS: Ah , shit . They 're gon na be pissed .
JEEP: I could try to rebuild it , but it 'd take a while , and I do n't think we have all the parts . If we call ight now , we might be able to get a new one down here tomorrow morning .
BOB: That 's not gon na happen . Goddamn phone 's out .
JEEP: What ?
GLADYS: Thank you , dear . How far along are you ?
CHARLIE: Just about there .
GLADYS: The father must be very proud .

CHARLIE: Out of sight . Out of mind .
GLADYS: Oh , I see . So you 're not married , I take it ?
CHARLIE: Nope .
GLADYS: That 's too bad .
CHARLIE: No , I prefer it that way . I do n't a need a man tellin ' me what to do .
GLADYS: But what about the baby ?
CHARLIE: I 've got it under control .
GLADYS: Yeah , but it 's gon na burn .
CHARLIE: What did you just say ?
GLADYS: I said your fucking baby 's gon na urn .
CHARLIE: Go to hell , lady .
BOB: What happened ?
CHARLIE: Total fucking Jesus freak .
GLADYS: All those babies . They 're gon na urn .
SANDRA: Gladys , please . There 's no reason to Gladys 's head suddenly whips toward her .
GLADYS: Shut up , you stupid fucking cunt ! All you do is complain ! Complain ! Complain !
SANDRA: Howard , it 's okay ! Do n't listen to her ! But Howard 's already standing over Gladys .

PERCY: Seventy , maybe eighty miles .
AUDREY: What 's that on the road ?
KYLE: They 're fuckin ' clouds ! What the fuck do they look like ?
AUDREY: Not clouds . Clouds do n't buzz .
BOB: I do n't understand how she was still standin ' after Percy hit ` e with that goddamn fryin ' pan . Broke her fuckin ' neck . I saw it . I swear I did .
BEAT: And did you see that kid 's gun ? The hell 's he doin ' with a gun like that ? Bob looks over at Jeep , sees him trembling .
BOB: It 's okay , Jeep . It 's okay .
JEEP: I could n't pull the trigger . I froze . I saw what I needed to do , ut I was afraid She could 've killed you !
BOB: There 's nothin ' to be ashamed of , Jeep .
BEAT: Not everybody can play the hero .
BOB: ( catching Percy by the
ARM: Where you going ? !
PERCY: To get my bible !
BOB: The hell you need that for ? !
PERCY: Well somebody 's got ta start prayin '
ALCOHOL: Okay , hold ` em steady .
CHARLIE: ( nods , peakish , to
HERSELF: Oh god , please do n't throw up .
BOB: She 's cold as a freakin ' ice cube . If I had n't just seen her walk in here , I 'd say the old bag 's been dead for hours .
KYLE: Well , I do n't care how long she 's een dead , the bitch ai n't stayin ' in here with us .
BOB: I do n't get it . Why do n't they come closer ?
KYLE: How the fuck am I supposed to know , man ? You askin ' me to explain the ehavior of a motherfuckin ' pestilence .

ROAD: Hey
BOB: Okay , now we 're talkin ' .
JEEP: Wait a minute . Check it out . It 's LAPD . What 's an LA cop doing way out here ? Bob and Jeep look over at Kyle .
KYLE: I 'm from Nevada , man .

CHARLIE: Oh , thank God , the police !
JEEP: Charlie , wait ! The men begin to run toward her While out of the police car steps
BOB: Take one step closer and I 'll drop you right here .
MICHAEL: That how you greet all you customers ?
BOB: Mister , after what we 've been through here today , you 're lucky we did n't shoot you first and greet you later . Now let me see you teeth . Michael stares at him blankly .
JEEP: No , shark teeth , Pop . Bob lowers the gun .

MICHAEL: I 'm running out of time .
BOB: Back off , fella

KYLE: What the ? Michael turns , sees the lights .
MICHAEL: They 're here .
PERCY: Lord , have mercy . ( waving back Audrey and
SANDRA: You ladies best get back inside .
AUDREY: Shut up , mom !
BOB: Wait . I do n't think that 's such a good idea .
JEEP: Dad , I can handle it .
BOB: He 's just a kid
JEEP: I said , I can handle it ! Michael 's eyes narrow , studying Jeep .
MICHAEL: He can handle it . He does n't have a choice .
BOB: C'mon , Jeep . We got ta go !
JEEP: Fuck it . And races after his father .
HOWARD: Sandra ? What 's happening ?
SANDRA: It 's okay ! Everything 's okay !
KYLE: Where the hell did they go ? Bob turns to Michael sharply .
BOB: Alright , Rambo . You got us up here . Now you mind explaining what the fuck we 're fighting ? Michael is about to answer , when
PERCY: Listen ! Over the wind , another sound becomes audible . The delicate chime of a CALLIOPE .
BOB: YeahThe hell is that ?
PERCY: It sounds almost like
KYLE: Ice cream .
MICHAEL: Alright . There 's a safety switch on the side of your gun . Push it all the way down . Two clicks . The men quickly do as they 're told .
PERCY: The fuck y'all lookin ' at me for ?

RECOVERING: I 'm okay . I 'm fine .
CHARLIE: Thanks
MICHAEL: I told you not to do anything ave .
KYLE: We got ` em runnin ' !
MICHAEL: Someone needs to be on the roof .
KYLE: I 'll go . Bob grabs Kyle 's arm .
BOB: Hold on . ( approaches Michael ,
DETERMINED: You better start talking .
MICHAEL: The first time God lost faith in Man he sent a flood . The second timehe sent what you see outside . Everyone takes that in for a moment , then
PERCY: You sayin ' this is the Apocalypse ?
MICHAEL: I 'm saying this is an extermination .
BEAT: Those things out there are vessels . The Possessed . The weakest willed are the easiest to turn .
KYLE: Possessed by what ? Demons ?
MICHAEL: Noby angels . That silences the room .
PERCY: Son , I do n't know what bible you een readin ' , but in my version , the angels are the good guys . Michael looks squarely at Percy .
MICHAEL: That 's where your book is wrong .
SANDRA: How come you know so much about them ?
MICHAEL: I know because until last night , I was on their side .
JEEP: You mean you 're Michael considers Jeep , then
MICHAEL: Not anymore
BOB: Right and yesterday I was the fuckin ' Easter Bunny . You know , fuck this . I do n't even believe in God .
MICHAEL: That 's fine , because He does n't elieve in you either .
PERCY: C'mon , Bob . Have you looked outside recently ? Those are n't exactly our regular customers out there .
BOB: How do we know he did n't bring them here himself ?
CHARLIE: He brings them here and then he saves us from them ? You 're a genius , Bob . Bob falls silent , confounded . Audrey hesitantly approaches Michael .
AUDREY: So you 're here to protect us ?
MICHAEL: Not you Her .
CHARLIE: Me ? ! Why me ? !
MICHAEL: Because your child is the only hope humanity has of surviving .
CHARLIE: No way !
STUNNED: Jesus Christ
MICHAEL: Exactly .
JEEP: You 're sayin ' she 's the mother of the Messiah ?
BOB: Wait a minute , is n't Mary supposed to be a vi
CHARLIE: Go fuck yourself , Bob !
PERCY: Makes you wonder about Mary .
CHARLIE: Look , this is not possible ! I 'm just a waitress ! I 'm nobody ! I ca n't give birth to the Savior of Mankind ! I do n't even own a car !
MICHAEL: None of that matters anymore . Either your child lives or Mankind dies .
KYLE: So what , we 're supposed to just hold those things off until Mary over there squeezes one out ?
MICHAEL: That 's right .
CHARLIE: That ca n't be . I 'm only eight months pregnant .
KYLE: Oh we 're fucked . We are so fucked !
SANDRA: How are we supposed to survive here for a month ?
MICHAEL: We wo n't have to
CHARLIE: It 's coming soon , is n't it ? Michael nods .
MICHAEL: If you want to live you 'll do what I say . This first attack was a test of our strength . The next one will be a test of our weakness .
BEAT: Something much worse is on its way .
KYLE: Okay , what 's your plan ?
MICHAEL: We 'll keep watch on the roof in shifts of two . Jeep , go get some tools . We need to close up this window before somebody else goes out .
PERCY: They 're out there . Sons of itches . I can feel ` em .
BEAT: Damn it 's cold !
KYLE: You were in the Army ?
PERCY: Navy , two tours . But the second one did n't work out so well , so I did n't get to go back for a third . Suppose that makes me lucky in a way . Served with Bob , you know . That 's how I ended up in this place .
KYLE: What was it like ? Being in a war ?
PERCY: Dark . Like this .
KYLE: What ?
PERCY: Your piece . The one you killed grandma with . Do n't reckon it 's for huntin ' buck .
KYLE: No . I uh keep it fo protection .
PERCY: Protection from what ?
KYLE: From people . Percy looks at him skeptically .
PERCY: People .
KYLE: Yeah , people who might try to give me a hard time , you know ?
PERCY: Just regular people or uh
KYLE: Yeah , well , no , not regular , egular people .
PERCY: Irregular people then .
KYLE: I 'm talkin ' people whose job it is to give other people a hard time . Kinda person who does n't get enough fiber in their diet , you know what I 'm sayin ?
PERCY: So it 's a work thing , is it ?
KYLE: Exactly . Strictly business .
PERCY: This business of yours You like it ? Kyle 's eyes narrow .
KYLE: Who the fuck are you to be sweatin ' me , man ? I got my reasons fo doin ' what I do .
PERCY: When I was a kid my father would sit by my bed every night before I 'd go to sleep and he 'd say to me , Percy , if you do n't wake up tomorrow , if it turns out that today was your last day on earth , would you be proud of what you 've done in this life ? Cuz if you ai n't , then you better start gettin ' square .
BOB: On the house .
SANDRA: Thanks .
BOB: You hungry ?
SANDRA: Could n't eat if my life depended on it .
BOB: Well I figure just cuz the world 's coming to an end , it does n't mean a man 's got ta starve . All I can say is thank heavens they left the gas on .
SANDRA: Never much cared for beer . Howard 's the beer drinker in the family .
JEEP: What did you doyou know , before you came here ? Michael considers the question a beat , then
MICHAEL: I was a soldier , a general , in His army .
JEEP: Well , what changed ? What made you leave ?
MICHAEL: I was given an order I did n't elieve in He lost faith . I had n't .
JEEP: So what happens to youafter this is over ?
MICHAEL: Sometimes we have to face the thing we fear the most in order to be free of it . Michael picks up his gun .
SANDRA: Howard ?
VOICE: Sandra Sandra freezes .
SANDRA: Who 's there ? A beat then
VOICE: Sandra Sandra spins around . Searching .
SANDRA: Howard ? Is that you ? It sure sounded like Howard .
VOICE: Help me Please
HOWARD: Help me , please !
SANDRA: Howard !
AUDREY: Mom ! Kyle races to restrain Sandra .
SANDRA: Let me go ! He 's alive !
CHARLIE: Percy ?
A SHEET: covering a body .
JEEP: We should get back out there
BOB: Just gim me another minute with him , okay ?
SANDRA'S FACE: Catatonic .
AUDREY: Hey CLEARER . Yes . It 's a VOICE !
RADIO VOICE: battling has been fierce . The numbers of casualties are unknown ut all indications are that they must be unimaginably large .
BEAT: If you 're just joining us , we 're getting some of the first bits of good news , if you can call it that , since this apocalypse began just twenty-four ago . A human militia has formed on the outskirts of Las Vegas and has begun to engage the enemy . Also down in the Fou Corners area , we 've been receiving unconfirmed reports of anothe esistance force gathering in Red Rock National in the northern Mojave Desert area .
JEEP: Red Rock
CHARLIE: That ca n't be more than an hour up the highway from here .
AUDREY: Does that mean we can leave ?
MICHAEL: No . We 're not going anywhere .
BOB: What the hell are you talkin ' about ? This is our chance !
MICHAEL: We ca n't risk being on the move when the child comes . It 's too dangerous .
RADIO VOICE: And as we fight this new enemy , may God give us the strength to survive and show mercy for those of us who are already lost
A CIGARETTE: being lit .
CHARLIE: Hey Jeep sees the strain on her face .
JEEP: You okay ?
CHARLIE: You mean besides the fact that I just found out that I 'm the mothe of the Messiah ? Jeep smiles , nods .
BEAT: For a while after that I tried pretending that it was just cold feet , that I could go back if I wanted to , that I could decide to end it like I 'd planned . Then I 'd start to have that feeling again and I knew I did n't have a choice . Somehow this had already been decided . And it made me hate this thing that 's been growing inside me . A long beat , as Jeep considers her , then
JEEP: You should n't say things like that , Charlie . It is n't right . You 'll get through this . I know you will .
CHARLIE: How come you have so much faith in me , Jeep ? God knows I 've neve given you or anybody else a reason to . Or is it that you just ca n't find any other hard-luck case to follow around ?
JEEP: You know , you 're not the only who 's suffered , okay ? Let me know when you stop feeling sorry fo yourself .
KYLE: Then you just flip this Audrey flips the safety .
AUDREY: Yeah , I got it . All the way down . Two clicks .
KYLE: I bet they did .
AUDREY: My parents hate everything I do . That 's why we were moving .
KYLE: Yeah ?
AUDREY: They thought a more `` wholesome '' environment would help me `` change my ways . '' So fucked up . Only eason they care at all is cuz they do n't want to be embarrassed in front of their friends at the country club . Kyle considers her thoughtfully .
KYLE: The only time my old man ever paid attention to me was when I was doing somethin ' bad . So you know what I did ?
AUDREY: What ?
KYLE: I got really good at being bad .
BOB: We back in business ?
MICHAEL: I do n't think so .
AUDREY: Is it over ?
KYLE: I do n't know . HEADLIGHTS appear on the highway .
AUDREY: No , I can handle it .
KYLE: Just in case .
AUDREY: Kyle , are they
KYLE: It 's a trap . They saw them coming and turned on the lights . It 's a fucking trap !
AUDREY: They 're not gon na make it .
BOB: Jesus Christ , what the hell is that oy doin ' !
CHARLIE: We have to get ` im back in here !
MICHAEL: Do n't . You open that door and we could all be dead .
KYLE: I got you !
WHISPERS: Fooled ya .

CHARLIE: Oh , no . Audrey
YOUNG BOY: I 'm sorry ! I did n't mean to !

JEEP'S VOICE: He 's still in here ! FLASHLIGHT BEAMS fan out across the diner . LIGHTING under chairs . Under tables .
BOB'S VOICE: Where the fuck is he ? !
JEEP: He 's bleeding !
BOB: What the fuck ?
JEEP: Dad !
MICHAEL: Get ready !
CHARLIE: Oh , no !
AUDREY: What am I supposed to do ? Just ` cause I 'm a girl does n't mean I automatically know how to do this !
MICHAEL: Just do as I say .
AUDREY: Yeah , but , how do you know how to do this ? !
BOB: What a way to bring a child into the world . She ever tell you his name ?
JEEP: She 's never said . I just assumed it was Joe Danvers . You know how she 's always had a thing for bad oys . Bob hears the spite in Jeep 's voice .
BOB: Jeep , sooner or later she 'll ealize you 're the best thing that 's ever happened to her .
JEEP: I thought you said I should move on ?
BOB: Ca n't a father be wrong sometimes ?
JEEP: What was that ?
AUDREY: What is that ? !
MICHAEL: He 's coming . We have to hurry .
AUDREY: Who 's coming ? Whaddya mean hurry ? This is n't something you can exactly hurry , is it ?
MICHAEL: Charlie , I need you to push . I need you to push as hard as you can .
AUDREY: Michael , who 's coming ? !

CHARLIE: I don'tI Audrey looks to Michael , unsure .
MICHAEL: Take him Give her a minute .
AUDREY: It 's okayIt 's okayShhh
CHARLIE: So are we safe now ? Is it over ?
MICHAEL: No . Killing the child would have ended the war before it had begun . Now , at least , he will have a chance to grow up , a chance to lead the world out of darkness . Those words provide her little comfort .
CHARLIE: And what happens until then ?
MICHAEL: You 'll need to teach him how .
CHARLIE: What makes you think I can do that ? What makes you think I want to do that ? If he 's so important , why do n't you take him ?
MICHAEL: Each of us has a burden . This one is yours and yours alone . Maybe someday you 'll understand what that means .
AUDREY: Mama ? Can you hear me ? We did itThe baby 's alive .
BEAT: Mama ?
JEEP: Something 's happening . They 're moving away .

MICHAEL: Gabriel . My lieutenant . He 's come to do what I would n't . ON JEEP as the realization hits him .
JEEP: Your orders Michael looks at Jeep .
CHARLIE: What 's he talking about ? The baby CRIES LOUDER .
MICHAEL: There was never meant to be a Second Coming . But we 've just changed that . The child lives . The future is unwritten . There 's still hope .
CHARLIE: Audrey ?
SANDRA: Stay away from me ! Do n't come any closer !
AUDREY: Mom !
BOB: Do n't do it , lady !
SANDRA: You heard what he said . They just want the baby . Maybe if we just give it to them , then they 'll let us go ! Michael cocks his gun . Points it at Sandra .
CHARLIE: Give him to me !
SANDRA: Why ? ! You never wanted him in the first place !
CHARLIE: No I Sandra is almost to the front door .
SANDRA: It 's just one baby . Just one .
JEEP: No !
MICHAEL: No , Jeep ! You must protect the child now !
JEEP: Me ? ! What about you ?
MICHAEL: My path ends here . You are the true protector . You always have een . Jeep shakes his head , panic setting in .
JEEP: But I do n't know what to do !
MICHAEL: Find the Prophets . Learn to read the instructions .
JEEP: Prophets ? What Prophets ? What instructions ? !
CHARLIE: Wait ! We ca n't leave him !
JEEP: We have no choice ! We have to get to Red Rock !
BOB: Leave me , Jeep . My place is here , emember ?
JEEP: But Dad ! Bob smiles weakly at his son and says simply
BOB: Run .
MICHAEL: I knew he 'd send you , Gabriel . You were always so eager to please Him .
GABRIEL: Unlike youthe rebellious son . Pity about your wings . They would have helped you now .
MICHAEL: To not feel their burdenis a dream .
GABRIEL: You think you can defy Him and not pay the price ?
MICHAEL: The child lives . What happens to me does n't matter now .
GABRIEL: Yours is a fool 's sacrifice . You can help them sneak out the back door , but they wo n't escape .
BEAT: And neither will you , brother . Michael slowly approaches Gabriel .
SOFT: I 'm not running anymore .
SENSING: Join with me . You do n't need do this . There 's another way . A beat , then Gabriel 's expression hardens .
GABRIEL: There is no other way
CHARLIE: Come on , Jeep !
JEEP: I 'm trying !
REVERSE: Hang on !
JEEP: Okay , we need to figure out ou weapon situation . Hopefully Michael did n't take everything out of the car .
CHARLIE: Is this what I think it is ?
JEEP: Yes . Now just put it down Slowly . Charlie places it onto the seat . Audrey fishes around in the backseat .
AUDREY: Okay , all I got is a flare gun thing . Looks like we got a box of flares to go with it .
JEEP: Okay . Okay . Handgun . Shotgun . A a flare gun And a grenade . Alright . Load this .
BEAT: Audrey , can you figure out how to load that flare gun without killing us all ?
AUDREY: I can try .
JEEP: Try real hard , okay ?
GABRIEL: You always wanted to live like one of themNow you 'll know how it feels to die like one of them .
AUDREY: Go faster !
JEEP: I ca n't fuckin ' see !
CHARLIE: Jeep , your arm ! Jeep sees it , eyes go wide .
JEEP: The instructions

AUDREY: We 're here .
JEEP: Okay , all we got ta do is

JEEP: Duck !
AUDREY: Do it , Jeep ! Do it now !

ANGUISHED: Audrey
CHARLIE: She saved us , Jeep . Audrey saved us . Now c'mon , we got ta go !
JEEP: What ?
CHARLIE: How can this happen in a world so eautiful ? Jeep follows her gaze to the sky . Endless stars . Confounding .
JEEP: C'mon , we 're almost there .
GABRIEL: So brave . So pointless . You should have worried more about saving yourself .
CHARLIE: Stop ! Please ! Do n't kill him !
GABRIEL: Go to sleep Jeep 's eyes flutter . He 's almost gone .
CHARLIE: Stop it ! I 'LL GIVE YOU THE BABY ! This gets Gabriel 's attention .
JEEP: Charlie , no !
GABRIEL: `` And as the child 's cries are extinguished , an eternal darkness at last descended upon the world . '' He peels the cloth back , revealing
JEEP: We made it .
CHARLIE: Yep , we sure did . And now we see it too
JEEP: I 'm sure they 're just over the next idge . He glances at Charlie . Worry in her eyes .
CHARLIE: What if we 're on our own now ?
JEEP: Do n't be afraid . We 'll be okay .
BEAT: Believe me .
CHARLIE'S VOICE: Someday when my son is older , I will tell him about the time of his irth when all the world was covered in a great darkness

INDY: That belongs to the Maker . It must be protected !
BLACK FALCON: What a lame boyscout thing to say ! You 're standing before the most powerful object in the world and you do n't want to use it ? You 're a eal nerd , Indiana Jones .

EMMET: I do n't know what happened . I was just looking out at the clouds , and It was an accident . The Foreman picks up the phone .

EMMET: Mom , I 'm going back to jail to epay my debt to society . A society that I would like to be a part of .
DORIS: You have to trust me
EMMET: You have to trust me ! I 'm my own person . You have to let me grow up and make my own choices

EMMET: What 's happening ? !
BARRISTA: Get in , I guess ? Emmet gets in and slams his foot on the gas !
EMMET: It 's my mom 's .

NINJA #1: You know what we want .

NINJA #1: Do we ?

LARRY: What the FLIPPING FLIP IS
EMMET: You 're breaking the speed limit , you know . Not to mention several other laws , as a well as a few other things that are not written into law per se , but are accepted social practices .
GEMINI: Emmet . Gemini drops the cloak hood , revealing
EMMET: Lucy ?
LUCY: It 's Gemini now .
EMMET: Are you a DJ ?
LUCY: No .
EMMET: So , uh , how have the last seven years been ?
LUCY: Okay .
DORIS: Emmet ? !
EMMET: So . I have a lot of questions .
LUCY: Is this really the best time to talk ?
EMMET: Well , so far
LUCY: Fine . Shoot .
EMMET: Why did those ninjas take my mom ? Why are there ninjas ? Are they obotic ninjas ? Where have you een the last seven years ? When did you gain magical superpowers ? Why did you change your name to Gemini ? Sounds pretty foofy if you ask me . Also , have you been following me around this whole time ? Because that 's pretty weird considering last time I saw you was when you dumped me fo absolutely no reason .
BARRISTA: You guys used to date ? Nice .
LUCY: Hardly .
EMMET: Oh try all of 8th grade !
BARRISTA: Burn .
LUCY: By the way , I 'm seeing someone now , so do n't get any ideas .
EMMET: I never have any ideas .
LUCY: You do n't get it , do you ?
EMMET: Get what ?
LUCY: They 're here for the Chosen One .
EMMET: The Chosen One ? What the heck is that ? Wait , you mean me ? ! I keep telling everyone- I 'm just a egular guy !
LUCY: Not you . Your mom .
EMMET: Oh . Really ?
LUCY: I was sent to get her , but they got to her first .
EMMET: You 're sure I 'm not the Chosen One ?
LUCY: Emmet , your mother is the most powerful being in the universe .
EMMET: But how she has cankles !
LUCY: Do n't we all .
EMMET: Okay I did not understand a lot of that .
LUCY: Just hold the wheel .
BARRISTA: So . What 's happening ?
LUCY: How Emmet ! Jump !
EMMET: Mom ! I 'm sorry . I 'm so sorry .
LUCY: It did n't break . How ?
EMMET: She 's gone . I ca n't believe she 's gone because she tried to protect me ?
BAD COP: Send everyone you can out hunting for that kid and whoever is trying to help him . You hear me ? !
MENACING: He 's wanted broken or together .
LARRY: I need a coffee .
EMMET: Who exactly are these evil forces my mom was trying to protect me from ? And why are the cops in league with robot ninjas ?
LUCY: You have a lot of questions .
EMMET: I 'm just getting warmed up .
LUCY: They all work for the Black Falcon .
EMMET: The Black Falcon ?
LUCY: Otherwise known as Rodrigo Falcone , the C.E.O . of Empura ?
EMMET: Empura ? I love their stuff .
LUCY: He is also the self-declared Emperor of all known LEGO realms . He kidnapped your mom because she is the only one who can stop him from destroying us all .
EMMET: My mom . My mom ?
LUCY: Emmet , did your mom have a safe deposit box , a safe , something where she would have hidden something very valuable ?
EMMET: No . The only thing she had that was worth anything was her purse . She takes it with her everywhere . Unfortunately it 's now melted to my arm . Ow !
LUCY: Nononononono Nononononono
EMMET: Well , I guess it 's not in there
LUCY: Nononononono
EMMET: November twenty-second . That 's not the combo .
LUCY: Of course . Your birthday . January six .
EMMET: You remember ?
LUCY: Not by choice .
EMMET: What is this thing ? It 's eautiful . They bask in its glow .
LUCY: Some say it 's the first piece ever . No one knows exactly what it does , but it is said the Chosen One will use it to one day save the world .
EMMET: And by that you mean my mom .
LUCY: There 's an inscription .
EMMET: One will come from land afar , With hand besmirched in shape of star . One to confront a great forsaker , And build a bridge to meet the Maker . This one will make the world right , But first there 'll be an awesome fight .
LUCY: The prophecy of the Chosen One
EMMET: Who is my Mom .
LUCY: Yes . We have to get this to you mom so she can fulfill her destiny and stop the Black Falcon before he destroys us all .
EMMET: And if it were n't for me , she 'd be here and everything would be okay .
CREATURE: Finn ? I thought I told you not to touch anything
EMMET: What was that ?
LUCY: What was what ?
EMMET: Where are we going ? !
LUCY: We 're going to take the MasterPiece to someone who can help .
EMMET: The MasterBuilders council ?
LUCY: No . They 're gone . All of them . She turns away , remembering . It 's painful .
EMMET: Then who ?
LUCY: Vitruvius . He was once a great MasterBuilder , now he'sretired . But he 's our only hope .
EMMET: Ca n't you do it on your own ? You were all like , heh-hoo-hiya ! Emmet lamely imitates her quickbuild kung-fu .
LUCY: I ca n't , I'mstill in training . I 'm not a full-fledged MasterBuilder yet . Technically , I 'm an intern .
EMMET: Well well well
LUCY: Do n't be a putz , Emmet .
EMMET: Everyone knows you 're not allowed to go Out of Town . It 's dangerous , uncharted and no one should ever go that 's what everybody says . Ca n't we just explain the situation to President Iamnotarobot ?
LUCY: Iamnotarobot is one of the Black Falcon 's robot henchmen . Eve notice how metallic he looks ?
EMMET: Come on . He 's just very fai skinned . It says `` Iamnotarobot '' in his very name ! Besides , he 's way better than Councilman Strawman . That guy is the pits .
LUCY: Do n't be naïve .
EMMET: What 's naïve ?
LUCY: That .
EMMET: My mom gave it to me and I 'm not giving it to anyone unless thei name is My Mom .
LUCY: Well then I guess you 're going to have to cross that line .
EMMET: Well then I guess I am .
LUCY: Well then go ahead and do it .
EMMET: Well then go ahead and do it I shall .
LUCY: Dude !
EMMET: Okay , okay .
LUCY: Not everything is what it seems
EMMET: Who are those guys ?
LUCY: Annoying short whiners . Plus they eproduce like crazy . It 's a real problem .
EMMET: Where are we ? Where are all the uildings ? And coffee shops ?
LUCY: Legopolis is only one realm in the Black Falcon 's dominion . He built walls around all of them so he can keep them separate . If the walls came down , he 'd have a hard time controlling the results . The MasterBuilders built secret passages through the walls so we could travel between lands .
EMMET: Who are they ?
LUCY: The Black Falcon 's sentries . They 're looking for us .
EMMET: So he controls all these worlds ?
LUCY: Shh !
ASSISTANT: The Black Falcon will see you now . Guards wheel her into
BLACK FALCON: Doris ! Did someone get you a water ?
DORIS: You 'll never get away with this .
BLACK FALCON: `` You 'll never get away with this ! '' What a cliché ! You do n't even know what it is I 'm trying to get away with . Maybe you should listen more .
DORIS: I 'm all ears .
BLACK FALCON: Truly ? Because listening and hearing are not the same thing .
DORIS: I 'm listening .
BLACK FALCON: Excellent .
THEN: Behold , the Kragle !
DORIS: The car in the city . That 's why it did n't break
BLACK FALCON: Very good . But there 's a lot more to my plan than that . Check it
DORIS: You never did understand the way of the Maker .
BLACK FALCON: Sure I do . There 's one right way to do everything , and I know it , and everyone else is wrong and is trying to screw me up ! Until now .
"DAD": I 'm sorry ?
BLACK FALCON: Like , you say to me `` Hello Black Falcon , I 'm Dale , and this is my wife Mary and our children Mark and Lisa . ''
"DAD": But you just said it .
BLACK FALCON: Well , just you say it now .
"DAD": Hello Black Falcon , I 'm Dale , this
BLACK FALCON: My wife Mary .
"DAD": My wife , Mary .
BLACK FALCON: And our children
"DAD": And our kids
BLACK FALCON: Children .
"DAD": And our children Mark and Lisa .
BLACK FALCON: All together now .
"DAD": Hello Black Falcon I 'm Dale , this is my wife Mary and ou children Mark and Lisa .
BLACK FALCON: Well , hello , Dale , Mary , Mark and Lisa . I 'm Black Falcon , and I 'm very FREEZE TO MEET YOU !
DORIS: You want to do this to the whole world ?
BLACK FALCON: So the whole world will be exactly how I want .
DORIS: But I 'll never see my son again . No mother will ever see her son .
BLACK FALCON: Unless they 're frozen when they happen to be looking at each other , exactly . Oh Doris , I 'm so glad we could finally meet again , after all these years .
DORIS: What do you want from me ?
BLACK FALCON: Is n't it obvious ? I want you to make me a better Kragle-Thingy !
DORIS: That 's really dumb .
BLACK FALCON: I mean this works okay , but it does n't have a wide enough spray . I need to make like a big cloud of sticky mist . And it 's not scary enough . And I hate the color .
DORIS: You 'll never get aw You 'll not achieve that which you have just described !
BLACK FALCON: What , do you think your pathetic son is going to save you o something ? He ca n't even put two icks together .
DORIS: I 've trained him . Secretly .
BLACK FALCON: Did you ? I think you protected him . Because you were afraid to have him live under the spectre of eing found out . Of being hunted . You wanted him to fit in . To feel normal , is n't that right ?
DORIS: Leave him out of this !
BLACK FALCON: I would , but I 'm pretty sure he has the MasterPiece . It was n't in your apartment , and it 's not on you . But your son seems to have interesting taste in handbags .
DORIS: No ! Do n't , please ! I 'll do what you want , please do n't hurt him .
BLACK FALCON: Oh , do n't worry , dear . You 'll do what I want regardless . I 'll simply use my very special electromagnetic machine to extract your thoughts and steal your ideas like I 've done for all the othe imprisoned MasterBuilders .
DORIS: No !
BLACK FALCON: Yes . Send her to the THINK TANK ! ! ! As Doris struggles , the guards take her away .
EMMET: Is it much farther ?
LUCY: Do you ever say something that is n't a stupid question ?
EMMET: What 's that supposed to mean ?
LUCY: I guess not .
EMMET: Who could live here ?
LUCY: A blind man .
VITRUVIUS: Hello ! What ? Hi !
EMMET: I see .
VITRUVIUS: Thank you . I am deprived of my sight , but my hearing is so acute that I can still perceive the physical world using echolocation .
EMMET: Like an old bat
VITRUVIUS: Precisely . I see with my ears . Now , how can I help you , extremely tall and fat stranger ?
EMMET: My mother has been kidnapped and it 's all my fault .
VITRUVIUS: MmmHard pass . Not interested .
LUCY: His mother is the Chosen One . I was sent to summon her . The Black Falcon got to her first . He has the Kragle . Vitruvius stops .
VITRUVIUS: Oh my . That is grave news indeed . But I 'm afraid I 'm retired . I 'm sure the active MasterBuilders are more than adequate .
LUCY: The other MasterBuilders are gone .
VITRUVIUS: I guess I 'm not redundant anymore .
EMMET: Why is he being so weird ?
VITRUVIUS: The Black Falcon was my student .
TEEN DORIS: Hey Rod . What 's that ?
END FLASHBACK: 43 .
VITRUVIUS: They were probably right .
EMMET: You taught my parents
VITRUVIUS: Your mother went into hiding to protect you . Your father never had a chance
LUCY: Vitruvius , you can still help us .
VITRUVIUS: That 's flattery , my dear . We both know you 're only here because you have no other place to go .
EMMET: We 're here because we do n't know what to do and you might . Sir , all I 've ever wanted was to get along with everyone and be a part of the world and now I do n't know if there 's going to be a world to be a part of . That is , unless you help me fix it . And I bet if you do , they 'll forget all about what they used to think of you . This gets Vitruvius ' attention .
VITRUVIUS: I wish I could , young man , but he has the Kragle , and he has the Chosen One , and if he has the Chosen One , he has the MasterPiece . And without that , there is no
LUCY: Hope ?
VITRUVIUS: The Kragle is the most powerful elic of the Maker .
EMMET: Who is this Maker you guys keep talking about ?
VITRUVIUS: The Maker . The being who put us all together and watches over us . Only by following the inspiration of the Maker can one become a true MasterBuilder .
EMMET: Okay that sounds super weird .
VITRUVIUS: It is , but then all the best things are .
EMMET: And what 's the Kragle again ?
VITRUVIUS: Every so often , the Maker drops a piece down to us that is unique , unlike any other . This crystal table is but one example . Some of them , in the wrong hands , can be weaponized . The Kragle , if harnessed , could
EMMET: destroy the world ?
VITRUVIUS: Yes . The Black Falcon has taken your mother , the one person who can stop him , and imprisoned her .
EMMET: Oh is that all we have to do ? That does n't sound too hard . Oh wait , I forgot to mention , I am saying this with a sarcastic inflection .
LUCY: That 's super constructive , thank you .
VITRUVIUS: We need to assemble a team of all emaining MasterBuilders hiding throughout the lands . We 'll scou the countryside high and low , overturning rocks , hiding from sentries , avoiding the major roads and air..
LUCY: We do n't have that kind of time !
VITRUVIUS: Or we could send out a mass email to the MasterBuilders list , and have whichever ones are remaining meet us at the midpoint .
EMMET: Better .
VITRUVIUS: And then , we sail for the Land of Unused Parts !
THEN: Anybody got a ship ?
EMMET: How long has your boyfriend had his own ship ?
LUCY: Why do you care ?
EMMET: I just think it 's interesting that you 're attracted to someone with his own vessel . Fairly superficial to date a guy with his own yacht .
LUCY: It 's not exactly a yacht .
NECKBEARD: Ahoy ! Welcome to the Sea Cow !
EMMET: Huh . Not what I expected .
NECKBEARD: Arr ! Come give your weary oyfriend a kiss ! She does .
EMMET: Wow . Neckbeard and Lucy begin MAKING OUT .
LUCY: Gosh , where are my manners ? Emmet , this is Neckbeard , my oyfriend . Neckbeard , this is Emmet . We used to date a million zillion years ago . It meant nothing to me . You have heard of Vitruvius , of course .
NECKBEARD: You 're the teacher that made the Black Falcon who he is , then ?
VITRUVIUS: That was a long time ago .
NECKBEARD: Farrr be it for a pirate to judge a man with an unsavory reputation .
EMMET: That 's surprisingly gracious
NECKBEARD: Stay away from me lady .
EMMET: Alright . Sure .
NECKBEARD: Say that to my face .
EMMET: Alright . Sure .
NECKBEARD: I was once the most feared MasterBuilder in all the lands . I lost the rest of me body fighting off a hundred of the Black Falcon 's men . You cross me , and I 'll make it an even fight , if you follow .
EMMET: Thank you for your clarity .
LUCY: He has an incredible mind .
NECKBEARD: Everyone hop aboard . Meet me crew . This be Orangebeard , Brownbeard and Nobeard , and me First Mate , Chewbacca . You can call him Allbeard .
EMMET: What 's our move ?
NECKBEARD: I 'm sorry , did the Captain say you could finish swabbing the deck ?
VITRUVIUS: Lucy . Welcome .
EMMET: It 's Emmet .
VITRUVIUS: Ah . You got your sea legs , yet ?
EMMET: Yes . What are you doing ?
VITRUVIUS: Making .
EMMET: What 's it for ?
VITRUVIUS: What is anything for ? It 's what we were all meant to do . What the Maker has fated us to do .
EMMET: Okay , here 's what I do n't get . If our lives really are predetermined y some all-controlling dude , what is the point of doing anything ? Vitruvius punches Emmet in the face .
VITRUVIUS: The Maker fated me to .
EMMET: Or you did it yourself because you 're a crazy person .
VITRUVIUS: Ah . Now , you 're learning .
EMMET: I could just never make something like that . How did you even get the idea ?
VITRUVIUS: I did n't . I just opened a window for it to fly through .
EMMET: Teach me .
VITRUVIUS: Open your throat and make a sound .
EMMET: No . Teach me to do what you do . Vitruvius smiles . But it 's bittersweet .
VITRUVIUS: How can I teach you something you already know ? It 's already inside you . You 've walled it up , but it still shines through . That terrific disaster you caused at the instruction site ? That was no accident .
EMMET: I 'm not sure I follow Vitruvius points up to the night sky .
VITRUVIUS: They say every night the Make puts a blanket over the world , a lanket with tiny holes . Some call them stars , but I call them MakerPeepers .
EMMET: MakerPeepers ?
VITRUVIUS: MakerPeepers . Emmet , there was a time , before you were born , when making new things came as naturally to everyone as eathing . The world was messy and wild , and that made it beautiful . But then , everything became rigid and prefabricated , so everyone just stopped thinking of new things . Making has been outsourced to Empura . The Black Falcon has paved over the world that was . Vitruvius indicates the sky .
EMMET: Oh no ! Wait !
THEN: It got out
VITRUVIUS: Is n't that marvelous ? You have an idea , and then off it goes !
BAD COP: That 's them . Man your weapons . Full steam ahead .
ROBOVIKING: We do n't use steam . We row .
BAD COP: Fine . Full row ahead .
NECKBEARD: They 're a-comin ' ! Dive !
EMMET: What are they doing ?
VITRUVIUS: Collaborating .
LUCY: Vitruvius , follow my lead .
NECKBEARD: Mateys ! Be me hands and legs ! Start taking the ship apart !
EMMET: But we 'll sink !
LUCY: That 's the idea .
NECKBEARD: Put the four-piece over there . No ! The skinny one . Come on !
EMMET: I do n't get it What do I do ?
LUCY: Build a hatch .
EMMET: Like for an attic ?
LUCY: Like for a submarine .
EMMET: Well
NECKBEARD: Heading ?
CHEWBACCA: Arrrrrrrr .
NECKBEARD: Get deeper . If we 're too high their sensorrrs will detect us .
BAD COP: Nothing ? But they were right here .
ROBOVIKING: Wait . There 's something on the scanner .
NECKBEARD: Dive ! Dive ! Dive !
ROBOVIKING: Nothing . There 's nothing .
BAD COP: Let me see that DAMMIT !
ROBOVIKING: Hey , watch it man , I built that .
EMMET: Hey Lucy , you got ta see
GROWN UP: Where are my dang keys ? Finn , have you been playing in here ?
KID: No .
GROWN UP: You sound like you are lying . Are you lying ?
KID: No .
GROWN UP: Okay , this is my very special area , where I play with something
KID: Uncle Ted , why do n't you have a girlfriend ?
GROWN UP: Because you need money fo girlfriends . Although they refuse to admit that . Although they admit it implicitly when they leave you for a banker .
KID: Why do n't you have a job ?
GROWN UP: Look , you can do anything you want with this big bin of parts , okay ? Just promise me you are n't going to play in my special areas anymore .
KID: Okay .
GROWN UP: Is that a real okay or a fake one ?
KID: Real .
GROWN UP: Okay . That 's my man .
VITRUVIUS: Legotopia . The last free kingdom in the universe .
EMMET: Does the Black Falcon know about this place ?
VITRUVIUS: It 's been hidden for ages by the fog and its remote location . Plus they have elaborate security measures .
DOOR FACE: Who goes there ?
EMMET: Oh , uh , I 'm Emmet . This is my ex- girlfriend Lucy , also a blind man , a pirate head , and a loud dog . We 're here to save the world .
DOOR FACE: Well , I 've never heard of you , but come on in ! The door opens .
LUCY: That 's the security ?
KING KARL: Hi ! I 'm Karl , and Welcome to my Krazy Kastle . Krazy with a K !
EMMET: For Kreativity
KING KARL: Exaktly !
EMMET: Why did you build all this stuff ?
KING KARL: WellWhy not ?
EMMET: You know we really do n't have time
KING KARL: Invent a game , like Rolle Cricket . Or buy Bullfighting Tennis tickets
NECKBEARD: This is me favorite sport .
KING KARL: We only teach art and music in school so kids feel unencumbered . No spelling , reading , science o math , we just make up all the numbers !
EMMET: No , rules were meant to be followed .
CHORUS: We have everything and nothing and something 's all we 've got . Why , you ask ? What you should ask is Why not ? ! ! ! ! The finish . Emmet is pretty overwhelmed .
EMMET: You guys are really weird .
KING KARL: Cool , man , thank you .
EMMET: This is crazy . You ca n't have a society without rules . I mean , your castle does n't look very structurally sound at all !
KING KARL: Who is this guy ?
LUCY: Emmet . He does n't get out much . Vitruvius pulls a frustrated Emmet aside .
VITRUVIUS: Emmet , these people are not MasterBuilders . They do not create with purpose , they create just to create . But they can also be very inspiring , because the only way to accomplish the impossible is to eak the rules of what is possible .
EMMET: I wish that made sense to me .
VITRUVIUS: It will if you let it . King Karl , I wish we came to you with better news .
KING KARL: As do I . The others arrived just efore you , which gave us a chance to rehearse the song . Follow me .
NECKBEARD: Ar ! What a bounty ! I be starrrving !
KING KARL: Meet your team .
BATMAN: Hey , I 'm Batman . Got the email . On my Batphone . Which I invented . Gets emails . On a phone .
EMMET: Hello .
DUPLO: DUPLO !
LUCY: And where do you come from ?
DUPLO: DUPLO !
LUCY: Okay . Um , he 's a MasterBuilder ?
KING KARL: No . But he wants to help .
DUPLO: DUPLO HELP !
BATMAN: I 'm a MasterBuilder . I built a lot of gadgets . Want to see my gadgets ?
LUCY: No thank you .
BENNY: I 'm also a MasterBuilder .
EMMET: Cool !
BENNY: I 'm Benny . Benny `` Blue '' Chu . Where are you from ? I 'm from space . There 's not a lot of oxygen up there . One time I was fixing my ship in space and there was a crack in my helmet . They say I should 've died or gotten Space Madness but I did n't die . I 'm here , right ? Ha ha ! Have you seen my spaceship ? I rebuilt it but it does n't fly for some reason .
EMMET: Um , maybe if it did n't have two fronts and no back , and it did n't have five wings .
BENNY: I love wings . Wings are great , ight ?
NECKBEARD: He seems a little distracted .
BENNY: What ? Where ?
LUCY: Is this everyone ?
BENNY: Oh , no . There 's one more . My co- pilot Moppy . He 's really organized . Benny holds a Mop .
MOPPY VOICE: Hi everybody . Did you meet my friend Benny ? He 's the best .
REGULAR VOICE: That 's too nice of you , Mopper .
MOPPY VOICE: He can really help you with you quest .
REGULAR VOICE: Well , I do n't know .
MOPPY VOICE: He gets real lonely sometimes .
REGULAR VOICE: Moppy !
MOPPY VOICE: It 's true . He was all alone in space . He tried to look for his space friends but could n't find them . No one is left but me . Him . BEAT . He looks so sad and lonely .
EMMET: What did you say you do again ?
BENNY: Oh , I 'm a Space Cadet . First Class .
EMMET: Ah .
VITRUVIUS: We are all that remain of the once proud society of MasterBuilders . Except for Duplo . And Emmet . He 's not a MasterBuilder , he 's just the son of one . And Lucy , who is still an intern .
BATMAN: Hello .
VITRUVIUS: Along with a blind man , a pirate head , a crazy spaceman , and Batman
BAD COP: Or did n't you know that as a former student of MasterBuilde academy , the Black Falcon was cc 'd on your mass email ?
KING KARL: I 'm sorry , I had to let them in .
LUCY: King Karl ! You betrayed us ! You etrayed everything you stand for !
KING KARL: Tsk , I know . Turns out Legotopia had run up like a bunch of debt . Something about lots of spending and no revenue . Empura promised to fund the whole place . Honestly , I 'm super sorry .
EMMET: This guy is supposed to be inspiring ? More like conspiring with a bunch of mean jerks who have my mom ! You 're just as bad as them , you big mean jerk !
KING KARL: Come on . Guys .
BAD COP: Do I look like a medieval constable ? No , they 're going someplace much worse . Take them to the conference room !
NOW?: ABOUT
BAD COP: Just , point the camera at you .
VITRUVIUS: Black Falcon ! Prepare to meet the Maker !
LUCY: No no he 's just on teleconference .
VITRUVIUS: What ?
LUCY: It 's like a phone . A telegram . He 's not actually in the room .
VITRUVIUS: Like a crystal ball ?
LUCY: Sure .
DORIS: Emmet !
EMMET: Mom ! I 'm coming ! I wo n't let you down . Any more than I already have !
BLACK FALCON: These are all the lands I control ! They are perfect ! And they are going to be that way forever ! Now that you ca n't mess any of them up ! Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha !
LUCY: So wait . What was the purpose of this call then ?
EMMET: You 're a MasterBuilder , too ?
KING KARL: I dabble . You were right . I 'd ather be poor and free than comfortable and stuck . They grab the MasterPiece and run away .
BAD COP: Back up ! Repeat . I need back up .
KING KARL: Bring it on . They run up the stairs .
BAD COP: Charge .
KING KARL: Charge !
EMMET: We ca n't leave you here .
KING KARL: It 's my place to be here . Go !
BENNY: Everyone get in my spaceship !
EMMET: Over there !
LUCY: We have to go now !
DUPLO: DUPLO HELP !
EMMET: I built that chair ! Check it out . That 's my chair . Pretty good .
LUCY: That 's far more impressive than this entire Rocket-Copter .
EMMET: Well , it was my idea to get in the catapult .
LUCY: A credit hog . Great .
BATMAN: Where 'd this thing come from ? We see R2D2 in the backseat .
R2D2: < WHISTLES
EMMET: No idea .
NECKBEARD: Bogey on our six !
BENNY: Hey look at that over there
LUCY: Benny ! Focus !
NECKBEARD: There !
EMMET: My chair ! ! ! !
BATMAN: I say we camp here for the night in this creepy Old West Ghost Town .
LUCY: What 's up ?
EMMET: Ca n't sleep . Kind of still upset about everything , you know ?
LUCY: Upset about what ?
EMMET: Well , I got in a fight with my mom that caused her to get kidnapped and the whole world is about to get frozen , if you must know , unless you were asking that sarcastically , which I now realize you were .
LUCY: Sorry . She takes pity on him . Anyone would .
EMMET: I hope so .
LUCY: I know it . I know you .
EMMET: I thought you said I did n't have a creative bone in my body .
LUCY: You do n't .
EMMET: That 's nice , thank you .
LUCY: I 'm just trying to help .
EMMET: You know what you are , Lucy ?
LUCY: What ?
EMMET: A real pain in the elbow . Lucy LAUGHS .
LUCY: You may not have a creative bone in your body , but you have a lot of really really earnest bones . You always did .
EMMET: Thank you ?
LUCY: I mean , that day when we were kids , and you drew the face in art class , you inspired me . I thought maybe there was more out there in the world , and maybe you felt the same . That 's why I asked you out . But then you ended up like everyone else and broke my heart , you know ? That I was going one way and you did n't go with me .
EMMET: Think of how I felt . My mom trained me to follow the herd . To lay low . All I ever wanted was to fit in , to have friends . And the funny thing is , maybe I was trying too hard , but , my whole life , I never did have any real friends .
LUCY: We 're being so dramatic . It was eighth grade !
EMMET: That 's the most dramatic time in anyone 's life , right ? It 's what made The Black Falcon such a world class dingaling .
LUCY: It made a lot of us dingalings .
EMMET: Yeah . Emmet looks away , sad .
LUCY: You know , whenever I doubt myself , I look into this prism I found long ago
EMMET: It 's beautiful .
LUCY: I know . It 's a relic of the Maker . When I 'm feeling low , I look at it , and it always makes me feel like there still is beauty in the world , and we all have a purpose . You know what I mean ? He stares at it , then at her .
EMMET: Yeah . I do . A long beat as they look at each other
LUCY: Well , good night .
EMMET: Yeah . Okay .
TED: Finn ? What did you do to the spaceship ? It 's in pieces ! I told you not to play with this and you broke it ! It took me years to uild all this !
MORE: 74 .
FINN: I 'm sorry , Uncle Ted . I just wanted to play .
TED: Well , life is n't all play . Sometimes it 's serious and it gets screwed up and you do n't feel like playing . You just wish for once everything was in the right place .
FINN: Okay .
VITRUVIUS: I do n't suppose this is the estroom ?
EMMET: No . Definitely not . Hey , Can I ask you something ? I keep having these strange dreams about a squishy bumpy giant Vitruvius stops .
VITRUVIUS: Visions of the Maker . Quite unusual .
EMMET: What does it mean ? Do I have a fate ?
VITRUVIUS: We all have a fate . But MasterBuilding is about channeling the power of the Maker , and taking that fate into our own hands . I guess it could mean what you choose to make it mean .
EMMET: Why do you always talk in weird iddles ? I just want answers .
VITRUVIUS: Then why do n't you try building something for yourself ?
EMMET: I 'm sorry , that 's lame .
PARROTING: That 's lame . That 's lame .
VITRUVIUS: Not bad . You 're learning now .
EMMET: No I 'm not . I 'm just copying what you did .
VITRUVIUS: A dilettante borrows . A true artist steals .
EMMET: That makes no sense !
VITRUVIUS: And all this does ?
LUCY: How the heck are we going to do this ?
EMMET: It 's okay . I have a plan .
LUCY: Really ?
EMMET: This R2 unit had the plans fo Empura Tower stored in its memory ank .
LUCY: That 's convenient .
EMMET: Looking over it last night , I noticed the tower follows the same construction principles as the condos I was building back in Legopolis .
LUCY: What about this ? She grabs the plans .
VITRUVIUS: How about this ?
BATMAN: Check this out
MORE: 78 .
NECKBEARD: AHOY !
LUCY: Stop it ! Everyone !
VITRUVIUS: Creativity in groups is hard .
LUCY: We do n't have time for that .
EMMET: Or we can just wing it . Everyone AGREES to wing it .
SERVICE NINJA: Well , I do n't know , I 've lived alone a long time , and sharing space with you is a new thing fo meno it 's not like that
REALIZING: Hey , we did n't order any
LUCY: I love you please move in with me .
EMMET: The Black Falcon 's office !
BATMAN: My office is bigger .
LUCY: Emmet .
NECKBEARD: Arr , his appointment book be saying he be scheduled for a massage at four .
BATMAN: He 'll get a flipping massage alright .
DAD: Language ! There are kids here .
BATMAN: Who are these nerds ?
SON: We , uh , ca n't move .
LUCY: They wo n't budge .
DAUGHTER: The bad guy is going to freeze everyone .
MOM: Kids ? Are you okay ?
DAD: They 're alright , baby .
SON: I miss you , mom .
EMMET: Me too .
THEN: This is really sad . How can you keep living like this ?
DAD: Well , yeah , we ca n't be together . We ca n't touch or see each other . But in here and if I could , I 'd e pointing to my head I 'm not stuck . In my brain we 're sharing a delicious meal together .
MOM: Thank you sweetie .
DAUGHTER: Pass the mustard . They all play along .
LUCY: That 's pretty elaborate .
DAD: They can freeze you . They can tell you what to do . But they ca n't stop our secret weapon . Ideas .
THEN: Now go give ` em hell . Lucy starts to exit .
EMMET: Wait . Batman , give me you Batperiscope .
NINJA: You have grown a beard .
ROBOSKELETON: Black Falcon ? You 're supposed to e at your massage .
EMMET: Mom
DORIS: What ? Emmet ?
EMMET: It 's me , Mom . I 've here to save you , so you can save the world . He pulls out the MASTERPIECE .
VITRUVIUS: Rodrigo Falcone . My old student . It 's time you went back to SCHOOL !
TO OTHERS: RUN !
BLACK FALCON: The old dog still has a few tricks . But I guess your friends did n't tell you that I was flanked y like a hundred soldiers . Now !
LUCY: Why wo n't anything in this hallway eak off ? !
BATMAN: It 's Kragle-frozen ! Batcrap !
NECKBEARD: Lucy .
LUCY: Yes ?
NECKBEARD: I want you to know , I love you .
LUCY: Me too
NECKBEARD: And even if the world be ending , and we all get frozen , I 'd feel etter about the whole situation if I could get frozen with you as my bride .
LUCY: Are you really doing this ?
NECKBEARD: Lucy . Will you take me hand in marriage ? Metaphorically .
LUCY: Um
NECKBEARD: Lucy ! Bad Cop et al reload .
EMMET: Mom ! Hurry ! Fling ! Doris is wrapped up .
DORIS: No !
BATMAN: We ca n't win this . We 've got to hide and make a new plan .
NECKBEARD: Arrr !
TO EMMET: Did you really think you were going to come up here and save the day ? You 're a follower , my friend . You do n't have the stuff .
TO DORIS: And you . You must be real proud of this one , huh ? He 's a credit to the family . Just like his talentless father .
EMMET: Mom , I 'm so sorry .
DORIS: I know sweetie .
EMMET: Just- tell me everything 's going to be okay .
DORIS: I wish I could , son .
EMMET: Mom Why did n't you why did n't you teach me what you knew ?
DORIS: I wanted you to be safe . I thought you would be happier . When I saw you with that funny drawing , it was so marvelous . And then I thought of what your life would e , how everyone would treat you . I just could n't let that happen .
EMMET: I know you 're the Chosen One , but I just wish you had let me choose for myself .
DORIS: II do n't know what to say .
EMMET: They got promoted
THEN: Look down there .
BATMAN: That does not look good .
NECKBEARD: When do we get to the part about coming up with a plan ?
BENNY: I 've got a plan .
NECKBEARD: Uh-oh .
BENNY: We 'll come back for them . After we stop that Kragle .
BAD COP: There they are ! Bad Cop and the RoboNinjas run after them .
NECKBEARD: What does it matter ?
BENNY: I fly better in blue .
BAD COP: No ! Re-open the door ! Everyone in ships ! Go !
ROBONINJA: Dude , you do n't have to yell .
HOBBIT: Every time !
BLACK FALCON: Bahahahahahahaha ! !
DORIS: It 's too horrible to bear .
VITRUVIUS: What is ? Describe it to me . I feel really really left out !
EMMET: The world is ending .
BATMAN: Go down to the city ! What are you doing ?
BENNY: Calling for help from my space friends !
NECKBEARD: What , a bunch of mops ? There be no space friends ! Just go !
BENNY: Alright , you do n't have to be mean about it . He heads for the city way down below .
LARRY: Of course .
MECHABIRD: We can do anything ! We can do anything ! The mechabird lands on the other barrista .
LARRY: Wait a minute
TO VITRUVIUS: No offense .
THEN: Who the heck did that ?
LUCY: That guy ? !
BLACK FALCON: Do I smell something burning ? It smells like a tire fire in here .
LUCY: Excuse me .
EMMET: Ow !
DORIS: I do n't know what to do . So tired Doris is super out of it .
LUCY: She 's too weak . You have to do it .
EMMET: Do what ? What can I do ? Emmet unties Lucy .
LUCY: I believe in you , Emmet . I was mad because you disappointed me for a while , but since it was n't your fault , I 'm willing to give you a mulligan on it .
EMMET: A what ?
LUCY: A mulligan . It 's from golf .
EMMET: You play golf ?
LUCY: The point is , you 've spent you whole life wanting to fit in and have friends , by pretending to be something you 're not . But now that you 've let the real you shine through , you 've made some friends who like you for who you are . And even if they 're just a crazy spaceman and a pirate head and a lind man and an intern
EMMET: You like me ?
LUCY: I do .
EMMET: Neckbeard likes me ?
LUCY: Sure .
EMMET: But I 'm not the Chosen One .
LUCY: You wanted to make your own choices , right ? So choose yourself .
EMMET: Nuh uh .
DORIS: What is it , Emmet ?
EMMET: I do n't know . It just came to me .
VITRUVIUS: You have channeled the Maker and chosen your fate . You have chosen to be the Chosen One .
BLACK FALCON: Whoa . That was weird .
LARRY: What the heck is that ? !
BENNY: Wow , that thing is really big .
NECKBEARD: Uh , Benny
LUCY: What do we do ?
DORIS: Go after him .
LARRY: Quick , everyone ! Run behind it ! Get away from the mist !
DOCTOR: It 's a b
EMMET: Sonot square .
EMMET TED: DAHHH ! ! ! ! DAHHH ! ! ! !
TED: What the heck are you ? !
EMMET: What the heck are you ? !
TED: I 'm a person .
EMMET: I 'm a person . You on the othe hand are a giant squishy beast .
TED: You 're a talking toy . This is considerably less cute than I have een led to believe .
EMMET: So ugly Emmet puts his hand up Ted 's nose .
TED: Calm down ! Where did you come from ?
EMMET: Did you build that ?
TED: Yeah , but it 's seriously messed up .
EMMET: Are you the Maker ?
TED: The what ?
THEN: FINN ! ! !
FINN: What ? Finn stops in his tracks .
TED: Are you seeing this ?
FINN: Yeah .
EMMET: Two Makers ?
TED: How did this what is my sets ,
FINN: The guys . They needed my help .
TED: Against what ?
FINN: Against the Kragle .
TED: The what ?
EMMET: The Kragle . The thing that is freezing everything together .
TED: Oh . Krazy Glue ?
EMMET: Good Lord .
TED: What ? I 'm using this to glue my set together . So it wo n't get messed up by the kid .
EMMET: But then it can never change .
TED: Exactly . It 's the only thing in my life that 's perfect .
MORE: 102 .
EMMET: But nothing is perfect unless it can change . You can make something , you know , and it can be great , for a while , but then then someone maybe adds to it , makes something new out of it . And that keeps happening until it ecomes something that a single person could never envision . Truth is , creating alone is never as good as creating with others .
TED: See . No . That 's not true- ecause with others , they do n't see things the same way , so
EMMET: I know . You want to control everything . I get it . But if you succeed , in the end , all you 'll ever have is what you 've got .
TED: What else could I have ?
EMMET: Who knows ? That 's the best part .
TED: Use this .
EMMET: What is it ?
TED: What is it ? It 's the ca
FINN: Cone of Power . It 's called the Cone of Power .
TED: Okay . The Cone of Power .
FINN: Put it on the Kragle to stop it .
TED: Yeah . Try that .
EMMET: Thank you . It was nice to meet you both , disgusting squishy giant Maker creature and smaller , messier giant Maker creature .
FINN: Nice to meet you .

CONVICT 5: I know she 'll wait I know that she 'll be true -
CONVICTS: Look down , look down They 've all forgotten you .
CONVICT 1: When I get free You wo n't see me Here for dust !
CONVICTS: Look down , look down Do n't look'em in the eye .
CONVICT 3: How long , O Lord Before you let me die ?
CONVICTS: Look down , look down You 'll always be a slave . Look down , look down You 're standing in your grave .
JAVERT: Now Prisoner 24601 . Your time is up And your parole 's begun . You know what that means ?
VALJEAN: Yes . It means I 'm free .
JAVERT: No ! It means you get Your yellow ticket-of-leave . He hands Valjean a folded yellow paper .
VALJEAN: I stole a loaf of bread My sister 's child was close to death And we were starving .
JAVERT: You will starve again Unless you learn the meaning of the law .
VALJEAN: I know the meaning of those nineteen years A slave of the law !
JAVERT: Five years for what you did , The rest because you tried to un . Yes , 24601 !
VALJEAN: My name is Jean Valjean !
JAVERT: And I 'm Javert ! Do not forget my name . Do not forget me -
CONVICTS: Look down , look down You 'll always be a slave . Look down , look down You 're standing in your grave .
VALJEAN: Freedom at last - How strange the taste ! Never forget the years - the waste , Nor forgive them for what they 've done . They are the guilty - Everyone ! The day begins
OVERSEER: Take your hat off .
OFFICER: Valjean .
INNKEEPER: My inn is full .
VALJEAN: Jailer . Would you let me stay here for tonight ?
JAILER: This is a prison , not an inn . Get yourself arrested . Then we will open up for you .
BISHOP: Come in , sir , for you are weary And the night is cold out here . Though our lives are very humble What we have we have to share .
VALJEAN: Pontarlier .
BISHOP: Is that where your family is ?
VALJEAN: No . The destination is compulsory . That is where the Law sends me . I have no home .
BISHOP: Then let this be your home , fo as long as you need it .
VALJEAN: You let me sleep here next to you ? How do you know I 'm not a murderer ? Valjean laughs a strange laugh .
BISHOP: God will take care of that .
CONSTABLE: Monsignor , we caught the thief ed-handed ! He has the nerve to say you gave him all this !
BISHOP: That is right . Amazed , Valjean looks up .
VALJEAN: What have I done ? Sweet Jesus , what have I done ? Become a thief in the night Become a dog on the run ! And have I fallen so fa And is the hour so late That nothing remains but the cry of my hate ? The cries in the dark that nobody hears Here where I stand at the turning of the years . If there 's another way to go I missed it twenty long years ago . My life was a war that could never be won . They gave me a number and murdered Valjean When they chained me and left me for dead Just for stealing a mouthful of ead ! Yet why did I allow this man To touch my soul and teach me love ? He treated me like any othe He gave me his trust He called me brother . My life he claims for God above Can such things be ? For I had come to hate the world - This world that always hated me ! Take an eye for an eye ! Turn your heart into stone ! This is all I have lived for ! This is all I have known ! One word from him and I 'd be back Beneath the lash , upon the rack . Instead he offers me my freedom !
BEGGARS' CHORUS: At the end of the day you 're another day olde And that 's all you can say fo the life of the poor . It 's a struggle ! It 's a war ! And there 's nothing that anyone 's giving . One more day standing about - What is it for ? One day less to be living .
FOREMAN: At the end of the day you get nothing for nothing ! Sitting flat on your bum does n't uy any bread !
FACTORY WOMEN: Bless the man who leads the way ! At the end of the day !
FANTINE: Give that letter to me It is none of your business . With a husband at home And a bit on the side ! Is there anyone here Who can swear before God She has nothing to fear ? She has nothing to hide ?
VALJEAN: What is this fighting all about ? Will someone tear these two apart ? This is a factory , not a circus .
FOREMAN: Now someone say how this began ! The factory women all turn on Fantine .
FANTINE: Yes , it 's true there 's a child And the child is my daughte And her father abandoned us , Leaving us flat . Now she lives with an innkeepe man and his wife And I pay for the child . What 's the matter with that ?
FACTORY WOMEN: At the end of the day she 'll be nothing but trouble And there 's trouble for all when there 's trouble for one ! While we 're earning our daily ead She 's the one with her hands in the butter - You must send the slut away Or we 're all going to end in the gutte And it 's us who 'll have to pay At the end of the day ! The Foreman pulls Fantine away .
FOREMAN: I might have known the bitch could bite ! I might have known the cat had claws ! I might have guessed your little secret ! Ah yes , the virtuous Fantine Who keeps herself so pure and clean - You 'd be the cause , I had no doubt Of any trouble hereabout . You play a virgin in the light But need no urging in the night !
FACTORY WOMEN: She 'll be nothing but trouble again and again !
FOREMAN: Right , my girl ! On your way !

JAVERT: You 've done the city proud , You 've raised their banner high .
VALJEAN: The dignity of toil To stay alive .
JAVERT: It seems to me We may have met . Valjean throws him a sharp glance .
VALJEAN: Your face is not a face I would forget . A CRASH from outside in the yard - shouts -
FOREMAN: No , Monsieur le Mayor !
CROWD: It 'll kill you as well !
JAVERT: Can this be true ? I do n't believe what I see ! A man your age To be as strong as you are ! A memory stirs You make me think of a man From years ago A man who broke his parole.. He disappeared .
VALJEAN: Say what you must . Do n't leave it there .
FAUCHELEVENT: Monsieur le Mayor , you come from God ! You are a saint !
VALJEAN: No more cart driving for you !

FANTINE: I do n't want you ! No ! No , M'sieur ! Let me go !
BAMATABOIS: Is this a trick ? I wo n't pay more !
FANTINE: No , not at all !
BAMATABOIS: You 've got some nerve , you little slut ! You 've got some gall ! It 's the same with a tart as it is with a groce The customer sees what he gets in advance It 's not for the whore to say `` yes sir '' or `` no sir '' It 's not for the harlot to pick and to choose or to lead me a dance !
FANTINE: I 'll kill you , you bastard ! Try any of that ! Even a whore who has gone to the ad Wo n't be had by a rat !
BAMATABOIS: By Christ you 'll pay for what you 've done ! This rat will make you bleed , you 'll see ! I guarantee I 'll make you suffer ! For this disturbance of the peace For this insult to life and property !
FANTINE: I beg you , do n't report me , sir . I 'll do whatever you may want .
BAMATABOIS: Make your excuse to the police !
JAVERT: Tell me quickly what 's the story . Who saw what and why and where ? Let him give a full description , Let him answer to Javert ! In this nest of whores and vipers Let one speak who saw it all . Who laid hands on this good man here ? What 's the substance of this awl ?
BAMATABOIS: Javert , would you believe it ? I was walking , it was dark When this prostitute attacked me You can see she 's left her mark ! He shows the blood . Javert turns to Fantine .
JAVERT: She will answer for her actions When you make a full report . You may rest assured , M'sieur , That she will answer to the court .
FANTINE: There 's a child who sorely needs me , Please , m'sieur , she 's but that high . Holy God , is there no mercy ? If I go to jail she 'll die .
JAVERT: I have heard such protestations Every day for twenty years . Let 's have no more explanations ,
VALJEAN: A moment of your time , Javert . I do believe this woman 's tale .
JAVERT: Monsieur le Mayor !
VALJEAN: You 've done your duty . Let he e. She needs a doctor , not a jail .
JAVERT: Monsieur le Mayor !
FANTINE: Can this be ?
VALJEAN: Where will she end - This child without a friend ?
FANTINE: M'sieur , do n't mock me now , I pray It 's hard enough I 've lost my pride . You let your foreman send me away . Yes , you were there And turned aside . I never did no wrong .
VALJEAN: Is it true what I 've done -
FANTINE: My daughter 's close to dying .
VALJEAN: - to an innocent soul ?
FANTINE: If there 's a God above -
VALJEAN: Had I only known then !
FANTINE: He 'd let me die instead .
VALJEAN: In His name my task has just begun . I will her to the hospital . Valjean picks Fantine up in his arms . Javert is quietly coldly furious .
JAVERT: Monsieur le Mayor !
FANTINE: Bring Cosette back to me .
VALJEAN: Where is she ?
FANTINE: At an inn in Montfermeil
JAVERT: Monsieur le Mayor !
VALJEAN: I will see it done ! I will send for her immediately !
JAVERT'S ASSISTANT: From Paris , Monsieur .
JAVERT: Monsieur le Mayo I have a crime to declare ! I have disgraced The uniform that I wear . I 've done you wrong , Let no forgiveness be shown . I 've been as hard On every rogue I have known . I 'll bear the blame , I must be treated Just the same .
VALJEAN: I do n't understand . What is this crime , Javert ?
JAVERT: I mistook you for a convict , I have made a false report . Now I learn they 've caught the culprit - He 's about to face the court . Valjean conceals his shock .
VALJEAN: You say this man denies it all , And gives no sign of understanding or repentance ? You say this man is going to trial , And that he 's sure to be returned to serve his sentence ?
JAVERT: He will pay , and so must I . Press charges against me , sir !
VALJEAN: You have only done your duty It 's a minor sin at most . All of us have been mistaken You 'll return , sir , to your post .
JAVERT: Must I do as you say ?
VALJEAN: It 's your duty to obey !
JUDGE: Monsieur le Mayor , you are not well , you must come with me , do you have a carriage outside ? Monsieu le Mayor , we must get you home to ed immediately ! !
VALJEAN: Is her daughter with her ?
NURSE: No , monsieur . Her guardian sent this .
VALJEAN: ` Money not enough . Send more . Thenardier . ' What sort of man is this ?
FANTINE: Cosette , it 's turned so cold ! Cosette , it 's past your bedtime ! You 've played the day away And soon it will be night .
VALJEAN: Dear Fantine , Cosette will be here soon ! Dear Fantine , she will be by you side
FANTINE: Come Cosette , the night has grown so cold !
VALJEAN: Be at peace ! Be at peace eve more .
FANTINE: My Cosette -
VALJEAN: - shall live in my protection .
FANTINE: Take her now !
VALJEAN: Your child will want for nothing .
FANTINE: Good m'sieur , you come from God in heaven .
VALJEAN: And none shall ever harm Cosette as long as I am living .
FANTINE: Take my hand The night grows ever colder .
VALJEAN: Then I will keep you warm . He wraps her in his arms .
FANTINE: Take my child I give her to your keeping .
VALJEAN: Take shelter from the storm .
FANTINE: For God 's sake , please stay till I am sleeping And tell Cosette I love he And I 'll see her when I wake
JAVERT: Valjean , at last We see each other plain ! ` M'sieur le Mayor ' You 'll wear a different chain ! Valjean stands to face Javert .
VALJEAN: Before you say another word , Javert , Before you chain me up like a slave again , Listen to me ! There is something I must do . This woman leaves behind a suffering child . There is none but me who can intercede - In mercy 's name , three days are all I need , Then I 'll return , I pledge my word ! Then I 'll return
JAVERT: You must think me mad ! I 've hunted you across the years . Men like you can never change - A man such as you !
VALJEAN: Believe of me what you will There is a duty that I 'm sworn to do . You know nothing of my life - All I did was steal some bread . You know nothing of the world - You would sooner see me dead . But not before I see this justice done !
JAVERT: Men like me can never change . Men like you can never change . No , 24601 ! My duty is to the law . You have no rights . Come with me , 24601 ! The two men fight .
VALJEAN: I am warning you , Javert , I 'm a stronger man by far ! There is power in me yet ! My race is not yet run !
JAVERT: Now the wheel has turned around - Jean Valjean is nothing now . Dare you talk to me of crime And the price you had to pay . Every man is born in sin Every man must choose his way .
VALJEAN: And this I swear to you tonight -
JAVERT: There is no place for you to hide .
VALJEAN: Your child will live within my care -
JAVERT: Wherever you may hide away -
VALJEAN: And I will raise her to the light .
COSETTE: There is a castle on a cloud I like to go there in my sleep . Are n't any floors for me to sweep , Not in my castle on a cloud .
MADAME THENARDIER: Now look who 's here ! The little madam herself , Pretending once again She 's been so awfully good ! Better not let me catch you slacking ! Better not catch my eye ! Ten rotten francs your mothe sends me - What is that going to buy ? Now take that pail , My little Mademoiselle , And go and draw some water from the well . We should never have taken you in In the first place - How stupid the things that we do ! Like mother , like daughter , the scum of the street .
COSETTE: Please do not send me out alone . Not in the darkness on my own .
MADAME THENARDIER: Enough of that , or I 'll forget to e nice ! You heard me ask for something , And I never ask twice !
CUSTOMER 1: Mine host Thenardie He was there , so they say , At the field of Waterloo .
CUSTOMER 2: Got there , it 's true , When the fight was all through But he knew just what to do .
CUSTOMER 3: Crawling through the mud , So I 've heard it said ,
CUSTOMER 4: He made a tidy score from the spoils of war .
THENARDIER: My band of soaks , My den of dissolutes , My dirty jokes , my always pissed as newts , My sons of whores , Spend their lives in my inn ! Homing pigeons homing in - They fly through my doors , And their money 's as good as yours !
MADAME THENARDIER: I used to dream That I would meet a prince But God almighty Have you seen what 's happened since ? ` Master of the house ' Is n't worth my spit ! Comforter , philosophe And lifelong shit ! Cunning little brain Regular Voltaire Thinks he 's quite a love But there 's not much there .
THENARDIER: What a cruel trick of nature Landed me with such a louse . God knows how I 've lasted Living with this bastard in the house !
MADAME THENARDIER: Master and a half !
THENARDIER: Everybody raise a glass !
MADAME THENARDIER: Raise it up the master 's arse !
VALJEAN: Hush now , do not be afraid of me . Do n't cry . Show me where you live .
COSETTE: I 'm called Cosette .
VALJEAN: Cosette ?
MADAME THENARDIER: Let me take your coat , m'sieur !
VALJEAN: Cosette shall live in my protection .
THENARDIER: You are very welcome here !
VALJEAN: I will not forget my vow .
THENARDIER: Take a glass !
MADAME THENARDIER: Take a chair !
VALJEAN: Cosette shall have a father now . Thenardier turns to his wife .
THENARDIER: What to do ? What to say Shall you carry our treasure away ? What a gem ! What a pearl ! Beyond rubies is our little girl ! How can we speak of debt ? Let 's not haggle for darling Colette !
MADAME THENARDIER: Cosette !
THENARDIER: Cosette - Dear Fantine - gone to rest - Have we done for her child what is best ? Shared our bread - shared each one - Treated her like she 's one of ou own ! Like our own , m'sieur !
VALJEAN: Your feelings do you credit , sir . And I will ease the parting blow . Let us not talk of bargains and ones and greed . He gives Thenardier money .
MADAME THENARDIER: That would quite fit the bill If she had n't so often been ill. Little dear , cost us dear ! Medicines are expensive , m'sieur . Not that we begrudged a sou - It 's no more than we Christians must do . Valjean gives more money .
THENARDIERS: One thing more ! One small doubt ! There are treacherous people about ! No offence ! Please reflect ! Your intentions may not be correct ! Valjean hands over more money .
VALJEAN: No more ! Here 's your price ! Fifteen hundred for you sacrifice . Come , Cosette , say goodbye . Let 's seek out some friendlie sky . Thank you both for Cosette - It wo n't take you too long to forget . He leads Cosette to the door .
COSETTE: Will you be like a Papa to me ?
VALJEAN: Yes , Cosette ! This is true ! I 'll be father and mother to you ! The cab sets off down the road .
THENARDIER: Not bad !
MADAME THENARDIER: Not enough !
JAVERT: Where 's the child Cosette ?
MADAME THENARDIER: She 's gone with a gent , Did n't tell us where they went , Did n't leave his home address .
JAVERT: Did you catch the fellow 's name ? Both Thenardiers shake their heads .
MADAME THENARDIER: You 're a bloody fool Look at what we got .
THENARDIER: Should have struck the iron , Struck it while it 's hot .
VALJEAN: Suddenly I see Suddenly it starts When two anxious hearts Beat as one . Yesterday I was alone Today you walk beside me Something still unclea Something not yet here Has begun . Suddenly the world Seems a different place Somehow full of grace
NUNS: Te lucis ante terminum Rerum Creator poscimus Ut pro tua clementia Sis praesul et custodia
FAUCHELEVENT: Who 's that ?
VALJEAN: Who are you ?
FAUCHELEVENT: Do n't you remember ? The cart fell on me !
VALJEAN: Monsieur Fauchelevent !
FAUCHELEVENT: You saved my life ! You got me this job as a gardener ! Valjean gazes at him , and remembers .
VALJEAN: Now you can do the same for me . We need a place of sanctuary . This child and I , we need to disappear .
FAUCHELEVENT: In this place of Holy Orders You are brought to God 's domain May the sisters grant you shelte May their prayers ease your pain .
VALJEAN: We 'll give thanks for what is granted What the sisters may ordain Here we pray for new beginnings - Here our lives can start again .

GAVROCHE: ` Ow do you do ? My name 's Gavroche ! These are my people , here 's my patch . Not much to look at - nothing posh ! Nothing that you 'd call up to scratch .

THENARDIER: You will have a job to find him ! He 's not all he seems to be - And that girl he trails behind him She 's the child he stole from me !
JAVERT: Could it be he 's that old jailbird That the tide now washes in ? Heard my name and started unning All the omens point to him .
THENARDIER: In the absence of a victim , Dear Inspector , may I go ? And remember when you 've nicked him It was me what told you so .
JAVERT: Let the old man keep on running I will run him off his feet ! Everyone about your business ! Clear this garbage off the street !
GAVROCHE: That inspector thinks he 's something But it 's me who runs this town ! And my theatre never closes And the curtain 's never down ! Trust Gavroche ! Have no fear ! You can always find me here !
EPONINE: Cosette ! Now I remember Cosette ! How can it be ? We were children together . Look what 's become of me .
MARIUS: Eponine ! Who was that girl ?
EPONINE: That bourgeois two-a-penny thing !
MARIUS: Eponine , find her for me !
EPONINE: What will you give me ?
MARIUS: Anything !
EPONINE: Got you all excited now , But God knows what you see in her . Are n't you all delighted now ? No , I do n't want your money , sir .
MARIUS: Eponine , do this for me , Discover where she lives . But careful how you go - Do n't let your father know . Eponine ! I 'm lost until she 's found .
EPONINE: You see ? I told you so ! There 's lots of things I know ! Eponine , she knows her way around .
JAVERT: There , out in the darkness A fugitive running Running from God Fallen from grace - God be my witness I never shall yield Till we come face to face - Till we come face to face He knows his way in the dark Mine is the way of the Lord Those who follow the path of the ighteous Shall have their reward And if they fall As Lucifer fell - The flame ! The sword ! Stars in your multitudes ! Scarce to be counted Filling the darkness With order and light - You are the sentinels Silent and sure Keeping watch in the night - Keeping watch in the night You know your place in the sky You hold your course
ENJOLRAS: Well , Courfeyrac ! Do we have all the guns ? Joly , Prouvaire ! Our time is unning short !
COURFEYRAC: Students , workers , everyone ! There 's a river on the run ! Like the flowing of the tide , Paris is coming to our side !
COMBEFERRE: Enjolras ! At Notre Dame The sections are prepared !
FEUILLY: At Rue du Bac They 're straining at the leash !
ENJOLRAS: Grantaire , put the bottle down ! Did we get the guns we need ?
GRANTAIRE: Give me brandy on my breath And I 'll breathe them all to death !
ENJOLRAS: The time is near So near it 's stirring the blood in their veins . And yet beware ! Do n't let the wine go to you ains . For the army we fight is a dangerous foe With the men and the arms that we never can match . It is easy to sit here and swat them like flies But the National Guard will be harder to catch . We need a sign To rally the people To call them to arms To bring them in line !
JOLY: Marius , wake up ! What 's wrong today ? You look as if you 've seen a ghost .
GRANTAIRE: Some wine , and say what 's going on ! They sit .
MARIUS: A ghost , you say ? A ghost maybe ! She was like a ghost to me - One minute there - then she was gone !
GRANTAIRE: I am agog ! I am aghast ! Is Marius in love at last ? I 've never heard him Ooh and Aah . You talk of battles to be won
ENJOLRAS: It is time for us all To decide who we are . Do we fight for the right To a night at the opera now ? Have you asked yourselves What 's the price you might pay ? Is this simply a game For rich young boys to play ? The colours of the world Are changing day by day - Red - the blood of angry men ! Black - the dark of ages past ! Red - a world about to dawn ! Black - the night that ends at last !
MARIUS: Had you seen her today You might know how it feels To be struck to the bone By a moment of breathless delight ! Had you been there today You might also have known How the world may be changed In just one burst of light And what was right seems wrong And what was wrong seems right !
GRANTAIRE: Red !
MARIUS: I feel my soul on fire !
GRANTAIRE: Black !
MARIUS: My world if she 's not there !
STUDENTS: Red !
MARIUS: The colour of desire !
STUDENTS: Black !
MARIUS: The colour of despair !
ENJOLRAS: Marius , you 're no longer a child - I do not doubt you mean it well But now there is a higher call ! Who cares about your lonely soul ? We strive towards a larger goal - Our little lives do n't count at all !
STUDENTS: The blood of angry men !
ENJOLRAS: Black !
STUDENTS: The dark of ages past ! Red - a world about to dawn ! Black - the night that ends at last !
GAVROCHE: Listen ! Listen to me !
COURFEYRAC: Listen , everybody !
GAVROCHE: General Lamarque is dead ! Enjolras turns to his companions .
ENJOLRAS: Lamarque is dead Lamarque His death is the hou of fate . The people 's man His death is the sign we await ! On his funeral day they will honour his name With the light of rebellion ablaze in their eyes . From their candles of grief we will kindle our flame . On the tomb of Lamarque shall ou arricades rise ! The time is here !
STUDENT: Let us take to the street with no doubt in our hearts
COURFEYRAC: But a jubilant shout !
LESGLES: They will come one and all !
STUDENTS: They will come when we call !
COSETTE: How strange - This feeling that my life 's begun at last ! This change - Can people really fall in love so fast ? What 's the matter with you , Cosette ? Have you been too much on you own ? So many things unclear - So many things unknown In my life There are so many questions and answers That somehow seem wrong . In my life There are times when I catch in the silence The sigh of a faraway song And it sings Of a world that I long to see - Out of reach Just a whisper away Waiting for me ! Does he know I 'm alive ? Do I know if he 's real ?
VALJEAN: Dear Cosette , You 're such a lonely child . How pensive , how sad you seem to me . Believe me , were it within my powe I 'd fill each passing hour . How quiet it must be , I can see , With only me for company .
COSETTE: There 's so little I know That I 'm longing to know Of the man that you were In a time long ago There 's so little you say Of the life you have known , Why you keep to yourself , Why we 're always alone . So dark ! So dark and deep , The secrets that you keep ! In my life Please forgive what I say You are loving and gentle and good . But papa , dear papa , In your eyes I am still like that child Who was lost in a wood .
VALJEAN: No more words - No more words . It 's a time that is dead . There are words That are better unheard , Better unsaid .
COSETTE: In my life I 'm no longer a child and I yearn For the truth that you know Of the years Years ago !
VALJEAN: You will learn . Truth is given by God To us all in our time , In our turn .
MARIUS: In my life She has burst like the music of angels The light of the sun ! And my life seems to stop As if something is ove And something has scarcely begun ! Eponine , you 're the friend Who has brought me here . Thanks to you I am one with the Gods And heaven is near ! And I soar through a world that is new , That is free !
EPONINE: Every word that he says Is a dagger in me ! In my life There 's been no one like him anywhere , Anywhere , where he is If he asked I 'd be his !
MARIUS: Waiting near !
EPONINE: Waiting here !
MARIUS: A heart full of love !
COSETTE: A heart full of love ! No fear , no regret !
MARIUS: My name is Marius Pontmercy .
COSETTE: And mine 's Cosette .
MARIUS: Cosette I do n't know what to say -
COSETTE: Then make no sound .
MARIUS: I am lost -
COSETTE: I am found !
MARIUS: A heart full of light -
COSETTE: This is a chain we 'll neve eak .
MARIUS: Do I dream ?
COSETTE: I 'm awake .
MARIUS: A heart full of love -
EPONINE: He was never mine to lose Why regret What could not be ?
COSETTE: A heart full of you -
EPONINE: These are words he 'll never say Not to me , not to me Not for me !
MARIUS: A single look and then I knew !
COSETTE: I knew it too !
EPONINE: His heart full of love
MARIUS: From today -
EPONINE: He will never feel this way .
COSETTE: Every day
VALJEAN: Cosette ! Cosette ! Cosette turns and runs in to the house .
MONTPARNASSE: This is his lair ! I 've seen the old fox around .
BABET: He keeps himself to himself He 's staying close to the ground .
THENARDIER: I smell profit here ! Ten years ago He came and paid for Cosette . I let her go for a song . It 's time we settled the debt . This 'll cost him dear .
BRUJON: What do I care Who you should rob ? Gim me my share ! Finish the job !
THENARDIER: You shut your mouth ! You 'll get what 's yours !
BRUJON: What have we here ?
THENARDIER: Who is this hussy ?
BABET: It 's your brat Eponine ! Do n't you know your own kid ? Why 's she hanging about here ?
THENARDIER: Eponine , get on home ! You 're not needed in this . We 're enough here without you .
EPONINE: I know this house , I tell you ! There 's nothing here for you ! Just the old man and the girl . They live ordinary lives .
THENARDIER: Do n't interfere ! You 've got some gall ! Take care , young miss , You 've got a lot to say !
BRUJON: She 's going soft !
CLACQUESOUS: Happens to all !
MONTPARNASSE: Go home , Eponine ! Go home , you 're in the way !
EPONINE: I 'm gon na scream ! I 'm gon na warn them here !
THENARDIER: One little scream and you 'll egret it for a year ! He goes to the gate and opens it . Eponine screams .
VALJEAN: My God , Cosette ! I heard a cry in the dark . I heard the shout of angry voices in the street .
COSETTE: Three men I saw beyond the wall Three men in shadow moving fast !
VALJEAN: This is a warning to us all ! These are the shadows of the past ! He moves away to his own bedroom .
COSETTE: To where ?
VALJEAN: Rue de L'Homme Armee .
COSETTE: No ! No !
VALJEAN: And then a ship across the sea .
COSETTE: No ! Please no ! We ca n't go !
VALJEAN: Hurry , Cosette ! It 's time to close another doo And live another day ! Valjean leaves to start packing . Feverishly , Cosette scribbles a letter .
COSETTE: Please give this to Marius ! He must know where to find me . She runs back inside .
EPONINE: And now I 'm all alone again - Nowhere to turn , no one to go to . Without a home , without a friend ,
MARIUS: Gone ? What do you mean ?
EPONINE: She 's gone to England .
VALJEAN: One day more ! Another day , another destiny . This never-ending road to Calvary . These men who seem to know my crime Will surely come a second time - One day more !
MARIUS: I did not live until today - How can I live when we are parted ?
VALJEAN: One day more !
COSETTE: Tomorrow you 'll be worlds away And yet with you my world has started !
EPONINE: One more day all on my own
ENJOLRAS: One more day before the storm !
MARIUS: Do I follow where she goes ?
ENJOLRAS: At the barricades of freedom !
MARIUS: Shall I join my brothers there ?
ENJOLRAS: When our ranks begin to form -
MARIUS: Do I stay and do I dare ?
ENJOLRAS: Will you take your place with me ? Grantaire rather reluctantly goes upstairs .
ALL: The time is now ! The day is here ! One day more !
JAVERT: One day more to revolution . We will nip it in the bud . We 'll be ready for these schoolboys . They will wet themselves with lood !
VALJEAN: One day more !
THENARDIERS: Watch'em run amuck ! Catch'em as they fall ! Never know your luck When there 's a free-for-all . Here a little dip , There a little touch - Most of them are goners So they wo n't miss much !
MARIUS: My place is here ! I fight with you !
VALJEAN: One day more !
EPONINE: One more day on my own
JAVERT: I will join these people 's heroes I will follow where they go . I will learn their little secrets , I will know the things they know .
THENARDIERS: Watch'em run amuck Catch'em as they fall Never know your luck When there 's a free-for-all !
VALJEAN: Tomorrow we 'll be far away .
ALL: Tomorrow we 'll discove What our God in heaven has in store - One more dawn ! One more day ! One day more !
CROWD: Do you hear the people sing Singing the song of angry men ? It is the music of a people Who will not be slaves again !
ENJOLRAS: Then join in the fight That will give you the right To be free !
COURFEYRAC: Some will fall and some will live Will you stand up and take you chance ?
ENJOLRAS: To the barricades !
JAVERT: I can find out the truth ! I know their ways , Fought their wars , Served my time In the days Of my youth .
PROUVAIRE: See ! The people unite !
GRANTAIRE: Pray your right
COMBEFERRE: Dogs will bark !
GAVROCHE: Fleas will bite !
LESGLES: They will do what is right .
ENJOLRAS: Red , the blood of angry men !
ALL: Black , the dark of ages past ! Red , a world about to dawn ! Black , the night that ends at last !
MARIUS: Hey , little boy , what 's this I see ? God Eponine the things you do !
EPONINE: I know this is no place for me , Still I would rather be with you !
MARIUS: Get out before the trouble starts ! Get out , ` Ponine , you might get shot !
EPONINE: I 've got you worried now , I have ! That shows you like me quite a lot
MARIUS: Get Out !
JOLY: He 's back !
JAVERT: Listen , my friends , I have done as I said . I have been to their lines , I have counted each man . I will tell what I can . Better be warned They have armies to spare And our danger is real - We will need all our cunning To bring them to heel .
ENJOLRAS: Have faith ! If you know what their movements are We 'll spoil their game . There are ways that a people can fight - We shall overcome their power !
JAVERT: I have overheard their plans . There will be no attack tonight . They intend to starve you out Before they start a proper fight - Concentrate their force , Hit us when it 's light -
GAVROCHE: Liar !
COURFEYRAC: Bravo , little Gavroche ! You 're the top of the class !
PROUVAIRE: So what are we going to do With this snake in the grass ? Enjolras faces Javert .
ENJOLRAS: Tie this man and take him To the tavern in there ! The people will decide your fate , Inspector Javert !
JAVERT: Shoot me now or shoot me later - Every schoolboy to his sport ! Death to each and every traitor ! I renounce your people 's court !
ENJOLRAS: Take this man . Bring him through . There is work we have to do .
ARMY OFFICER: Who 's there ?
ENJOLRAS: French Revolution .
ARMY OFFICER: Fire !
ENJOLRAS: Comrades , do not fire back ! Do not waste powder !
ARMY OFFICER: Who 's there ? Get down !
MABEUF: Vive la France !
ARMY OFFICER: Fire ! A second volley .
MARIUS: Clear out or I 'll blow up the arricade ! Everyone freezes .
ARMY OFFICER: Blow it up then and take yourself with it !
MARIUS: And myself with it !
FEUILLY: Thank you !
LESGLES: What were you thinking !
MARIUS: Eponine ! What have you done ? He kneels by her side . Eponine is dying .
EPONINE: Here It 's from Cosette I kept it from you
MARIUS: Eponine , you 're hurt ! You need some help ! Rain begins to fall .
EPONINE: Do n't you fret , M'sieur Marius - I do n't feel any pain . A little fall of rain Can hardly hurt me now . You 're here - that 's all I need to know And you will keep me safe And you will keep me close And rain will make the flowers grow
MARIUS: But you will live , Eponine - Dea God above ! If I could close your wounds with words of love -
EPONINE: Just hold me now , and let it be . Shelter me Comfort me
MARIUS: You will live a hundred years If I could show you how I wo n't desert you now
EPONINE: The rain ca n't hurt me now This rain will wash away what 's past And you will keep me safe And you will keep me close I 'll sleep in your embrace at last . Marius tries to comfort Eponine in his arms .
MARIUS: Hush-a-bye , dear Eponine You wo n't feel any pain A little fall of rain Can hardly hurt you now I 'm here .
EPONINE: So do n't you fret , M'sieur Marius I do n't feel any pain A little fall of rain Can hardly hurt me now
MARIUS: I will stay with you Till you are sleeping .
EPONINE: That 's all I need to know And you will keep me safe
ENJOLRAS: They were the first to fall . The first to fall upon this arricade .
MARIUS: Her name was Eponine ! Her life was cold and dark , yet she was unafraid !
COMBEFERRE: We fight here in her name
PROUVAIRE: She will not die in vain
LESGLES: She will not be betrayed
COURFEYRAC: Are you alright ?
GAVROCHE: That was my sister .
MARIUS: Gavroche ! Do you know the Rue de l'Homme Armé ?
GAVROCHE: Course I do !
MARIUS: Will you take this for me ? He holds out his note .
GAVROCHE: Letter for Cosette .
VALJEAN: I 'll take it .
GAVROCHE: Something for you , something fo me . Who needs charity ?
VALJEAN: ` Dearest Cosette , you have entered my soul And soon you will be gone . Can it be only a day since we met And the world was reborn ? If I should fall in the battle to come Let this be my goodbye . Now that I know you love me as well It is harder to die . I pray that God will bring me home To be with you . Pray for your Marius . He prays for you . '
JOLY: Here comes a man in uniform ! What brings you to this place ?
VALJEAN: I come here as a volunteer .
JOLY: Approach and show your face !
PROUVAIRE: You wear an army uniform .
VALJEAN: That 's why they let me through .
JOLY: You 've got some years behind you , sir .
VALJEAN: There 's much that I can do .
JOLY: You see that prisoner over there ?
GRANTAIRE: A volunteer like you !
COMBEFERRE: A spy who calls himself Javert !
GRANTAIRE: He 's going to get it too !
GAVROCHE: Do n't shoot ! I know him ! He 's no soldier !
ENJOLRAS: For your presence of mind , For the deed you have done , I will thank you , M'sieur , When our battle is won .
MARIUS: Thank you , M'sieur .
VALJEAN: Give me no thanks , M'sieur . There 's something you can do .
ENJOLRAS: If it is in my power .
VALJEAN: Give me the spy Javert ! Let me take care of him . Javert hears this with grim satisfaction .
JAVERT: The law is inside out . The world is upside down .
ENJOLRAS: Do what you have to do - The man belongs to you . He turns to his little army .
VALJEAN: We meet again
JAVERT: You 've hungered for this all you life . Take your revenge . How right you should kill with a knife . Valjean uses the knife to cut Javert free .
VALJEAN: You talk too much . Your life is safe in my hands .
JAVERT: Do n't understand
VALJEAN: Get out of here .
JAVERT: Valjean , take care ! I 'm warning you .
VALJEAN: Clear out of here !
JAVERT: Once a thief , forever a thief . What you want , you always steal . You would trade your life fo mine . Yes , Valjean , you want a deal ! Shoot me now for all I care - If you let me go , beware ! You 'll still answer to Javert !
VALJEAN: You are wrong , and always have een wrong . I 'm a man no worse than any man . You are free , and there are no conditions - No bargains or petitions . There 's nothing that I blame you for . You 've done your duty , nothing more . No doubt our paths will cross again . He raises his gun and points it at Javert .
ENJOLRAS: Courfeyrac , you take the watch - They may attack before it 's light . Everybody keep the faith , For certain as our banner flies , We are not alone - The people too must rise !
GRANTAIRE: Drink with me to days gone by !
FEUILLY: Sing with me the songs we knew !
PROUVAIRE: Here 's to pretty girls Who went to our heads !
JOLY: Here 's to witty girls Who went to our beds !
STUDENTS: Here 's to them - And here 's to you !
GRANTAIRE: Drink with me to days gone by ! Can it be you fear to die ? Will the world remember you when you fall ? Can it be your death Means nothing at all ? Is your life just one more lie ?
ALL: Drink with me To days gone by ! To the life That used to be ! At the shrine of friendship Never say die Let the wine of friendship Never run dry ! Here 's to you And here 's to me !
MARIUS: Do I care if I should die Now she goes across the sea ? Life without Cosette Means nothing at all.. Please do n't weep , Cosette , Should Marius fall . Will you weep , Cosette , For me ?
VALJEAN: God on high Hear my praye
ENJOLRAS: The people have not stirred .
COURFEYRAC: Yet we will not abandon those Who still live in fear .
ENJOLRAS: The people have not heard , Yet we will not abandon those who can not hear . Let us not waste lives ! Let all who wish to Go from here !
GAVROCHE: Do you hear the people sing
FEUILLY: Enjolras ! Ammunition 's short .
MARIUS: I will go into the streets . There are bodies all around . Ammunition to be had . Lots of bullets to be found .
ENJOLRAS: I ca n't let you go .
VALJEAN: Let me go ! He 's no more than a boy . I am old . I have nothing to fear .
GAVROCHE: I volunteer !
COURFEYRAC: Come back , Gavroche ! Do n't you dare !
JOLY: Someone pull him down right now !
GAVROCHE: Look at me , I 'm almost there !
COURFEYRAC: No-o !
ARMY OFFICER: You at the barricades listen to this ! The people of Paris sleep in their beds ! You have no chance , No chance at all ! Why throw your lives away ? Enjolras gazes on his pitifully small group .
ENJOLRAS: Let us die facing our foes ! Make them bleed while we can !
COMBEFERRE: Make'em pay through the nose !
COURFEYRAC: Make'em pay for every man !
ENJOLRAS: Let others rise to take our place Until the earth is free !
GRANTAIRE: Long live the republic !
SOLDIER: Nothing here ! The soldiers depart . A moment of silence .
THENARDIER: Here 's a hint of gold Stuck into a tooth - Pardon me , m'sieur , You wo n't be needing it no more . Should n't be too hard to sell .
VALJEAN: How do I get out of here ?
THENARDIER: There ! That way !
VALJEAN: It 's you , Javert ! I knew you would n't wait too long . The faithful servant at his post once more . This man 's done no wrong . And he needs his family 's care .
JAVERT: I warned you I would not give in ! I wo n't be swayed !
VALJEAN: Another hour yet And then I 'm yours And all our debts are paid .
JAVERT: The man of mercy comes again And talks of justice !
VALJEAN: Come , time is running short - Look down , Javert ! He 's standing in his grave ! He starts to move past Javert .
JAVERT: One more step and you die .
VALJEAN: Then I die .
JAVERT: Take him , Valjean , Before I change my mind ! I will be waiting
WOMAN 1: Did you see them Going off to fight ?
WOMAN 2: Children of the barricade Who did n't last the night .
WOMAN 3: Did you see them Lying where they died ? Someone used to cradle them And kiss them when they cried .
WOMAN 4: Did you see them lying side by side ?
WOMAN 5: Who will wake them ?
WOMAN 6: No one ever will .
WOMAN 2: No one ever told them that A summer day can kill .
WOMAN 7: They were schoolboys Never held a gun Fighting for a new world that Would rise up like the sun .
WOMAN 3: Where 's that new world Now the fighting 's done ?
GILLENORMAND: Marius ! You 've come back to us !
MARIUS: Grandfather
GILLENORMAND: Rest , Marius . No more harsh words etween us . I just thank God you 're alive .
MARIUS: There 's a grief that ca n't be spoken There 's a pain goes on and on Empty chairs at empty tables Now my friends are dead and gone .
COSETTE: Every day You walk with stronger step , You walk with longer step . The worst is over .
MARIUS: Every day I wonder every day Who it was brought me here From the barricade .
COSETTE: Do n't think about it , Marius ! With all the years ahead of us ! I will never go away And we will be togethe Every day . Every day We 'll remember that night And the vow that we made .
VALJEAN: She was never mine to keep She is youthful , she is free

COSETTE: I saw you waiting and I knew -
GILLENORMAND: Thank God , thank God you are here ! Thank God , thank God you are home !
MARIUS: Waiting for you ! At your feet !
COSETTE: At your call !
MARIUS: M'sieur , this is a day I never can forget . Is gratitude enough For giving me Cosette ? Your home shall be with us And not a day shall pass But we will prove our love To you , whom we shall call A father to us both , A father to us all .
VALJEAN: Not another word , my son . There 's something now that must e done
MARIUS: You 're Jean Valjean !
VALJEAN: Make her believe I have gone on a journey A long way away . Tell her my heart was too full for farewells - It is better this way . Promise me , Monsieur , Cosette will never know
MARIUS: I give my word .
VALJEAN: What I have spoken , why I must go .
MARIUS: For the sake of Cosette , it must e so .
COSETTE: Where 's he gone without a word That would n't be his way to go
MARIUS: All he asked for me to say He 's on a journey , far away . Dear Cosette , he loves you so Perhaps he will return some day .
COSETTE: He ca n't leave us now What 's our wedding day Without him giving me away ?
WEDDING GUESTS: Ring out the bells Upon this day of days ! May all the angels Of the Lord above In jubilation Sing their songs of praise ! And crown this blessed time With peace and love !
MAJORDOMO: The Baron and Baroness du Thenard
THENARDIER: I forget where we met Was it not at the Chateau Lafarge Where the Duke did that Puke Down the Duchess 's decolletage ?
MARIUS: No , ` Baron du Thenard ' , The circles I move in are humble y far Go away , Thenardier ! Do you think I do n't know who you are ?
MADAME THENARDIER: He 's not fooled ! Told you so ! Show M'Sieur what you 've come here to show . Tell the boy what you know !
THENARDIER: Pity to disturb you at a feast like this But 500 francs surely would n't come amiss .
MARIUS: In God 's name say what you have to say .
MADAME THENARDIER: He speaks . You pay !
THENARDIER: What I saw , clear as light , Jean Valjean in the sewers that night , Had this corpse on his back Some boy he 'd killed in a viscious attack . I was there , never fear ! Even found me this fine souvenir !
MARIUS: I know this ! This was mine ! This is surely some heavenly sign ! Thenardier steals the ring back .
THENARDIER: And there 's more ! Mark this well - It was the night that the arricades fell .
MARIUS: Then it 's true ! Then I 'm right ! Jean Valjean was my saviour that night !
THENARDIER: Jean Valjean - the old con . You pay up and I 'll say where he 's gone .
MARIUS: Not so loud ! Here 's for you . God forgive us the things that we do .
MADAME THENARDIER: How 's about some extra On a day so glad Our little orphan girl She has n't done so bad . Raised in a convent Cash to spare - We want our share .
THENARDIER: Quite the little nun , ai n't she !
MARIUS: Where is he ?
THENARDIER: The convent .
MADAME THENARDIER: Everywhere you go Law-abiding folk Doing what is decent
THENARDIER: But they 're mostly broke !
MADAME THENARDIER: Singing to the Lord on Sundays
THENARDIER: Praying for the gifts he 'll send -
MADAME THENARDIER: Watch'em till they drop !
THENARDIER: Masters of the land
MADAME THENARDIER: Always get our share
VALJEAN: Alone I wait in the shadows I count the hours till I can sleep . I dreamed a dream Cosette stood
FANTINE: M'sieur I bless your name
VALJEAN: I am ready , Fantine
FANTINE: M'sieur lay down your burden
VALJEAN: At the end of my days
FANTINE: You raised my child in love ,
VALJEAN: She 's the best of my life
FANTINE: And you will be with God .
VALJEAN: Cosette ?
COSETTE: Papa , papa , I do not understand - Are you all right ? Why did you go away ?
VALJEAN: Cosette , my child ! Am I forgiven now ? Thank God , thank God , I 've lived to see this day ! Marius comes to him .
MARIUS: It 's you who must forgive a thoughtless fool ! It 's you who must forgive a thankless man ! It 's thanks to you that I am living , And again I lay down my life at your feet . Cosette , your father is a saint ! When they wounded me He took me from the barricade , Carried like a babe , And brought me home to you !

BOWMAN: `` Major development in South Indian Ocean set fo fall of 2010 '' That sounds interesting , but they 're too tied to their holdings . Remembe a year ago when they lost that tanker ? The bottom fell out of their stock and I lost a bloody fortune . That 's when I decided to diversify .
WILLIE: You take your money , too seriously , Bo .
BOWMAN: You 're damn right I do . Five years down here and I 'll pull in more than 15 topside . I 'm not down here for the fun , I 'll tell you that .
WILLIE: Get out of here , Sixpack .

BOWMAN: Your `` hangovers '' made you miss the Sixpack Good Morning Show . `` No goddamn boy is going to make me go out on a down day . ''
JONES: Yeah ? How 'd the kid hold up ?
COBB: Pretty good . He sent them out videotaping outcrop .

JONES: How far away is she ?
DOC: Two hundred meters . WILLIE 'S VOICE silences them .
DEJESUS: Nine , ten feet high
BOWMAN: If he had his blinkers on
JONES: It would n't make any difference in thereHe could be two feet away and on fire and she 'd still not see him !
WILLIE: Sixpack ?
BECK: Why ca n't we pick up his signal ?
DEJESUS: Maybe he got eaten ?
BOWMAN: What would be dumb enough to eat Sixpack ?
BECK: AffirmativeWidening picture .

BOWMAN: Yeah , I 'd say you can retire with all this loot .
SIXPACK: Shut up .
WILLIE: What is it ?
JONES: `` Debbie Does Dallas '' Hell , it 's in Russian . I ca n't ead it
DOC: May I see it ? Jones hands it to Doc who looks at it . DOC It 's a log of some sort .
WILLIE: Vodka .
COBB: What assholes , they lock booze in the safe .
DEJESUS: Probably confiscated . No ooze on board , same as us .
DOC: Stolichnaya . Everyone looks at Doc .
COBB: You read Russian ?
DOC: Russian , French , Italian , Spanish , Greek , German , a little Hindu , some Serbo Croat and a smattering of Swahilistandard pre-med background Cobb stares at him a second then
COBB: Bullshit .
DOC: and a Russian grandmother Beck ignores them and addresses Bowman .
BECK: I want all this stuff impounded in the supply safe .
DOC: You mind if I take a look at this ?
BECK: Be my guest .
DEJESUS: You got 'em !
SIXPACK: What good 's the kid 's med ecords anyway !
DEJESUS: Watch and learn , amigo
BECK: What do you want me to say ? That it all sounds mysterious ?
DOC: These observers were doing something . A testI think they sank that ship on purpose to cover up their mistakes .
BECK: What mistakes ? Look , I think it 's no big deal but if you want to find out why this ship sank have Maritime run a check .
DOC: I did . They have no record of the wreck . The Marshal Goloviev is now on a tour in the Baltic Sea . Beck stops . This is a mystery .
DEJESUS: It 's not the phone number
BOWMAN'S VOICE: Okay , try the social security number
DEJESUS: Okay , give it to me
BOWMAN: Twotwelveninety-six .
SIXPACK: You guys are so full of shit Who 's going to use thei irthday
SIXPACK: Like I said , that bottle 's mine !
DOC: I want your permission to check that vodka .
BECK: This is a mining shack , not a lab , Doc . If there 's something strange with the vodka it 's safe till we get back .
COBB: Beck 's coming .
BECK: Something wrong , Cobb ?
COBB: Uh..Excuse me sir , it 's the ai ecirculating system , sir
BECK: What 's wrong with it ?
COBB: I 'd really have to show it to you .
BECK: All right
BOWMAN: Cute , DeJesusSpecimen cups ?
JONES: Aw , loosen up , Bowman Hey , Willie , I got one served up for you . Willie shakes her head .
WILLIE: No , thanks . I 've got my lood tests in three days .
DEJESUS: That 's all you do is exercise . You got to learn to live a little .
WILLIE: After my astronaut training physical , u > then I 'll tie one on .
SIXPACK: Forget space cadet , I 'll drink hers .
COBB: Hey what happens it he goes ack and finds the bottle missing ?
DEJESUS: He wo n't
SIXPACK: Shit ! It 's water !
JONES: Beck switched it !
DEJESUS: Can you beat that ? The sonof- abitch does n't trust us !
SIXPACK: That little turd . If I ever get the chance I 'll fix his ass .
BOWMAN: Did n't I ever tell you vodka was my favorite drink ?
BECK: That was a loud one was n't it ?
WILLIE: After a month of it you 'd think I 'd be used to it .
BECK: How 's astronaut training ?
WILLIE: Why ? You going to give me hard time like the others ?
BECK: No . I 'm just being friendly .
WILLIE: GoodIt 's going good .
BECK: Whatever made you want to do a tour down here ?
WILLIE: I need electrical field experience on my resume . Everything helps Why are you here ?
BECK: Everybody in corporate training serves a tour on the line . Sup- posed to hone leadership skills or something .
WILLIE: Has it helped ? Beck shrugs .
BECK: You think I should hang around more with the crew ?
WILLIE: Well , I always heard you do n't `` learn '' leadership , you earn it . How did you know they 'd get into the vodka ? Beck looks up from his clipboard and smiles .
BECK: I guess I figured if I was in their shoes that 's what I would 've done .
WILLIE: Maybe you 're more one of us than you thinksir .
JONES: Puuleeeeze
DEJESUS: Hey , SixpackRise and shine amigo
DOC: Let 's see your tongue . Sixpack obliges as Beck enters .
BECK: What 's wrong ?
DOC: Pretty good imitation of a hangover and I ought to know .
SIXPACK: Well , it ai n't ! It feels a thousand times worse .
DOC: Where ?
SIXPACK: II dunno . I just feel wrong .
DOC: Take off your shirt .
SIXPACK: Shit , DocI did n't know I had them .
MARTIN: as long as you know it 's not in your contract .
BECK: I know that .
MARTIN: Well , suit yourself , thenits your decision Ha haa little jokesuit yourself Beck interrupts impatiently .
BECK: How 's the weather for pickup tomorrow ?
MARTIN: Beautiful .
COBB: Bad as he is there 's no way we can make our quota with- out his sad self out there . You just ca n't do it .
DEJESUS: He 's tanking on us
WILLIE: Nohe 's really sick . I heard him last night . The company will take that into consideration
JONES: Honey , the company do n't give a flying fuck about `` whys , '' they just look at the numbers and the contract says if we miss ou quota they only got to pay us half-pay for the entire month .
DEJESUS: 'Cocksucker 's tanking on us
BECK: No , he 's really sickHe wo n't e going out today . The crew increases its bitching
COBB: There goes our quota
BOWMAN: Thirty days , right down the toilet
COBB: Excuse me , sir
BECK: Is this a contract violation , Mr. Cobb ?
COBB: No sirI just wanted to know if you needed a hand ?
BECK: Thanks
SIXPACK: Please , DocI 'm coldI hurt
DOC: I 'm just going to take a tiny piece of skin to look at unde the microscopeAfterwards I 'll give you a sedative .
DEJESUS: Okay , number 23 's full .
BECK: Let 's get it out of here and ing in a new one .
JONES: Yes sir
BOWMAN: Hook 's on 24
BECK: Let 's have her
DOC: No kidding ? `` A virus of unknown origin . '' Come on and tell me something I do n't know like what 's going on
DEJESUS: Good work out there , Mr. Becky .
JONES: Thank you , sir .
BECK: Dead ? This morning you said he had some skin disorder .
DOC: He did .
BECK: Well , how the hell does a skin rash kill you in eight hours ? !
DOC: Here . Put this on . You examine him .
BECK: I 'm not a doctor .
DOC: For thisyou do n't need to be . Beck hesitates , then puts on the mask .
BECK: The mask is because you think it might becatching ?
DOC: I do n't know . I 've been back and forth with Narragansett Naval all day , consulting with the best people in maritime medicine , the est people in viruses
BECK: And ?
DOC: And they did n't believe the symptoms I described
BECK: Why Sixpack ?
DOC: It could be a million things , something in the air , food . But he went on that ship and so did Williams I want to examine the crew .
BECK: Yeahright He starts to the door and Doc watches him .
DOC: I 've reported the death to the company .
JONES: `` Routine , '' my ass ! Ai n't nothin ' `` routine '' about no physical check- up 10,000 feet downespecially when we 're getting picked up the next day !
COBB: He did n't say it was a `` routine check-up , '' he said it was a `` routine u > precaution . ''
WILLIE: Must be bad . Even sick Sixpack never missed a meal .
DEJESUS: It 's this fucking air system .
COBB: Ai n't the food or the air system , he 's just sick Everybody gets sick every now and then . It 's all part of being human ! Bowman suddenly becomes pale .
BOWMAN: Well , I must be human because I 'm sure as hell sick .
COBB: Christ , it 'd be a hell of a thing if I went back to the roof with some kind of herpes thing . My wife would n't understand that at all
DOC: You seem all right .
COBS: She would n't understand . She 'd think I was down here fucking my head off .
JONES: This whole thing 's unnecessary , Doc . Only `` skin problem '' I got is white people How come you 're wearing those gloves ?
DOC: Not yet . You got any ideas ?
WILLIE: You do n't think it was from going on that ship do you ?
DOC: That 's a possibility . But if it was that simple why have n't the symptoms begun on you ? Doc turns away to let her dress .
WILLIE: You mean I 'm okay ?
DOC: You 're fine .
DEJESUS: You mean like a fish ?
DOC: Yeslike a fish
DEJESUS: I was just joking , Doc .
MARTIN: Well , according to Maritime law , you , as commander of the Shack have the authority to dispose of the body . However , the company does n't want you to do that .
BECK: What you do n't understand is that my crew is in jeopardy .
MARTIN: But you do n't have any proof at this point to assume that this disease is contagious , do you ?
BECK: I 'm not anxious to find out , either .
MARTIN: Beck , trust me . If the company felt that you or your crew were in any danger we would authorize an immediate emergency pickup . We could be there in a few hours .
BECK: Do it .
MARTIN: Unfortunately . We ca n't . He picks up a sheet of computer paper . MARTIN There is a typhoon about 600 miles off the coast of Baja . It 's not coming your way but the Company does n't want to lose you folks or an emergency ship should it veer your way .
BECK: What 're you saying ? That we 're not even going to be picked up tomorrow ?
MARTIN: It should n't be a long delay .
BECK: But it 's a delay ! How long ? A day ? Two days ? !
MARTIN: Twelve hours , no big deal . We should know something first thing in the morning . Do n't worry .
WILLIE: Bo ? Doc says you 're next .
JONES: Hey , SixpackHey , my man How you feeling ?
WILLIE: Who were you talking to ?
JONES: Sixpack
WILLIE: How is he ?
JONES: Sleeping . No sign of Doc , though . I 'll check the control room . You look in the shower room
BOWMAN: Oh , Godwhat 's going on ?
BOWMAN: Sixpackwhat 's going on ?
DOC: You have to call them back . Explain that this is an emergency . Jones enters .
JONES: Excuse me , sirBowman 's sick . She 's downstairs in the infirmary .
DOC: The infirmary ?
JONES: Yes sir , ai n't that where we usually go when we 're sick ?
DOC: We 're simply concerned about herproximity to
BECK: Sixpack 's dead .
JONES: BullshitI was just talking to him . I saw him move .
BECK: What ?
JONES: I left her here .
DOC: Bowman ?
BECK: I ca n't tell you much about it , except that none of you show any symptoms .
DEJESUS: And it killed Bo ?
BECK: Noshe killed herself . ON WILLIE the news hits her hard .
JONES: We 're getting out of here just in time .
BECK: There 's now a problem with the weather for pickup . There 's a typhoon in our sector We 're going to be delayed twelve hours
DEJESUS: Typhoon ? !
JONES: Twelve hours !
COBB: At least we get time and a half . That 's in the contract .
JONES: Fuck double pay , man ! I want out of here !
BECK: Jones Stay here .
DEJESUS: C'mon , Cobbyou 're slacking
COBB: I ai n't , goddamnitIt 's Jones ! .. Before Jones can argue , Beck cuts them off .
BECK: Shut up , all of you .
COBB: Mr. Beck , the contract states that no body can be disposed of without authorization of-
JONES: Fuck the contract , man !
DEJESUS: Hey ! I feel something . It 's moving ! He 's alive !
COBB: I feel it , tooSomeone 's trying to get out .
JONES: Cobb , what 're you doing !
COBS: But he ai n't dead ! He ai n't dead .
BECK: Cobb ! Stop !
COBB: It bit me ! It bit me !
JONES: Push Hazy !
BECK: No !
COBB: It bit me !
DEJESUS: It 's Sixpack !
COBB: I 'm going to kill it !
BECK: Close the Lock ! Now !
DEJESUS: Serves his ass right to get it . Motherfucker brings that shit onboard . I hope his fucking ass rots in the sea and is shit upon by the fish .
JONES: 'Fucker could have gotten us all killed .
COBB: He knew better than that .
WILLIE: You guys sure were n't so holy when you were shooting that vodkaIt could have been you .
DOC: Hold it ! Rewind it . Beck rewinds it .
DEJESUS: You know that Innsbruck has 64 square miles of ski slopes , man ? Think about that . Sixty-four square miles .
JONES: How 'd you do that ?
DEJESUS: What ? That ? I 've done this one before . You hungry ? I 'm hungry .
JONES: Hungry ? After what we just went through I may neve eat again .
BECK: They found this ?
DOC: No . I think they isolated him in genetic engineering . Homo aquaticus
BECK: Was there such a thing ?
DOC: Danakil man ? one of ou ancestors . Named for the Danakil Alps in Ethiopia .
BECK: Not exactly a big ocean country .
DOC: It was when it counted a couple of million years ago when the seas came in and drove us into the water . Most homo sapiens did n't make itDanakil man u > adapted .
DOC: Some say that 's why we 're asically hairless , for less water resistance , faster swimming speeds
BECK: But what about those scales or that leech-like thing that it Cobb ?
DOC: Why stop with just one aspect of marine life ? Why not incorporate the best genetic components the ocean has to offer ?
BECK: Well , if they were perfecting an aquaman , then why 's there a dead one onboard that Russian ship ? Why is n't he out swimming around ?
DOC: He obviously lacked something in his environment .
JONES' VOICE: Turned black yet ?
COBS: That ai n't funny .
JONES: Relax , Cobb . If it was going to turn , it would have done its trick by now .
COBB: That 's easy for you to say . You ai n't the one that got bit .
JONES: Do n't tell me you 're getting soft on us , Cobbie ? You 're the fellow who always said
COBB: Nothing 's changed , goddamnit !
JONES: Man , everybody is jumpy What are you doing ?
DEJESUS: Getting some food .
JONES: Under there ?
DEJESUS: Look . Water .
JONES: Probably the plumbing . You gon na make me finish that puzzle y myself , or what ?
DEJESUS: No , I 'll be right there .
JONES: Hey , Hazywhat 're you doing nowcooking ? There is no answer and Jones looks up . JONES Hazy ?
DEJESUS: Help me , Jonesy . Oh , God , help me ! It 's getting inside me , I can feel it !
JONES: Hazy , pleaseI 'm going to get you some help , manjust do n't touch me
COBB: What 's going on ?
JONES: It 's HazyIt 's got him ! Stay here and do n't let him out . I 'm going to get the Doc .
DEJESUS: Help me ! Help me !
JONES: It 's got Hazy !
BECK: What has ?
JONES: One of those chunks of Sixpack ! Like a big leech , with those teeth !
DOC: We 've got to get him to the infirmary .
JONES: What are you going to do to him ?
DOC: I 'm going to try to remove it .
JONES: I 've got Cobbie downstairs watching the door .
COBB: I ai n't doing nothing for that thing without something to defend myself .
JONES: That thing happens to be my friend .
BECK: Shut up , both of you ! We 've got to find it .
COBB: Oh , God , she 's out there
BECK: Jonescome with me . Cobb , you and Doc check the rooms .
JONES: Willie
WILLIE: Yeah ?
JONES: I ought to smack your face !
WILLIE: What 's wrong ?
JONES: DeJesusIt 's got him .
BECK: I thought they were your friends ?
JONES: Were , Doss were .
BECK: You fire that in here and you 'll bring the whole place down .
JONES: Jones to Doc . Doc ? Cobb ? He looks back to Beck , concerned . JONES Think it got 'em ?
BECK: No , it 's not going through . The intercom 's busted . I thought DeJesus fixed that ?
JONES: He did .
COBB: What happened ?
DOC: Italmost got you .
COBB: What was it ?
COBS: I saw it ! It 's big !
BECK: Big ?
JONES: Bigger than DeJesus ? How ?
DOC: It 's had a meal .
WILLIE: It needs blood ?
JONES: Fucking greatYou telling me we got a fucking dracula in here with us ?
DOC: It would explain the suction- like appendages .
JONES: Like a leech .
BECK: That 's why there 's a dead one on the ship . It ran out of blood .
JONES: What dead one on the ship ? He looks from Doc to Beck . JONES Someone want to let the rank and file in on your little secret ? Doc looks at Beck , then Jones .
DOC: The monster appears to be a genetic aberration
JONES: No fuckin ' lie
DOC: It has many traits of deep sea marine liferegeneration , scales , gills , even a period of dormancy ut the fact that it remembered where the plasma was stored , o where the communication wiring was , may imply that it has some othe quality
COBB: What ? What ? Beck locks eyes with Doc .
BECK: That it acquires intelligence from its victims ?
DOC: Intelligence may not be the right word
JONES: Fuck semantics , Doc ! You saying its like part DeJesus , part Sixpack , part Bowman ? !
DOC: I do n't know . I 'm guessing .
COBB: I say we should go get in the escape bubbles and get the hell out of here !
JONES: And hit the surface in the middle of a typhoon ? No , thank you . I 'll take my chance down here . Willie looks at Beck .
WILLIE: What can we do ?
BECK: Our only chance is to lure it to the Swamp and flush it like we did the other .
COBB: And how 're we going to do that ?
DOC: Be careful with it .
BECK: Do n't worry , I do n't want to give up any more .
DOC: Still bothering you ?
COBB: Itches like hell .
DOC: Take it off and let me have a look .
WILLIE: You ca n't go out there alone .
DOC: I 'm the Doctor . I have to do what 's best for this crew . I need my bag .
DOC: There , good as new . Just keep your paws off of it . Do you have the new bandage ready ?
WILLIE: Doc ? Doc !
DOC: No !
BECK: I hear something . Do n't fire until we 're both in the Swamp . Jones moves a little farther back . BECK Do n't let him see you .
JONES: Do n't worry
WILLIE: Oh God
BECK: Run Willie ! Run !
JONES: Well done . Just like momma makes 'em .
BECK: Where 's Cobb and Doc ?
WILLIE: Cobb 's cutIt was in him ! It got Doc
JONES: Oh man , that 's just great
BECK: C'mon .
BECK: Lock the door .
WILLIE: The escape bubbles ? She and Jones stop in front of Doc 's console .
JONES: Look at this . Beck looks at Doc 's computer screen .
WILLIE: What is it ?
JONES: The good doctor signed ou death warrant .
WILLIE: Well , at least we 're safe inside here .
JONES: For how long ?
MARTIN: Thank goodness , you 're still alive !
JONES: Hey , man , you better get your ass out here right now and get us . You hear me , motherfucker ? Right now !
MARTIN: Please relax , Mr. Jones . Every- thing is under control . Naturally , when we received Dr. Warren 's message we were concerned but would never have deserted you .
WILLIE: When are you coming for us ?
MARTIN: Well , that 's the bad news . The typhoon did turn your way . Right now it is on a course
JONES: Just answer the question , man ! When are you coming ? !
MARTIN: Hopefully in the next 48 hours .
BECK: Forty-eight hours !
MARTIN: I realize you must have gone through hell
JONES: Gone ? Man , we 're still here !
MARTIN: I ca n't change the weather . Try to get some rest . I 'll keep you posted .
BECK: He 's right . Why do n't you get some est . I 'll stand the first watch .
BECK: Martin , you asshole Suddenly he hears a voice behind him .
WILLIE: They know , do n't they ?
BECK: YeahI think they 're just deciding what to do with us .
WILLIE: Maybe they already have .
BECK: What are you doing ?
WILLIE: Seeing how my stock 's doing
BECK: I ca n't believe they 'd just leave us . A voice behind them causes them to turn .
JONES: Welcome to the union , boss . We 're all expendable .
WILLIE: What is it ?
JONES: The air 's stopped .
BECK: We 're on backup air .
WILLIE: How much time does that give us ?
BECK: Less than an hour . It 's ruptured an air duct .
WILLIE: Ca n't we fix it ?
JONES: There 're twenty miles of pipe in the bilge , they could have tapped-in anywhere .
BECK: They 're drawing us out .
WILLIE: You ca n't go out there , that 's what they want . Beck checks his make-shift flamethrower .
BECK: We do n't have much choice without air , the internal pressure will fall and
JONES: CrunchImplosion .
WILLIE: You do n't think I 'm sitting in here , do you ?
JONES: She 's wondering what 's happening . We 're losing air faster than I thought .
BECK: Which way ?
WILLIE: Do n't spend all day down there .
JONES: Do n't fuckin ' worry , I ai n't .
WILLIE: Okay , Williamslet 's hear a tune . `` Off we gointo the wild lue yonder ''
JONES: Jesus Christ
BECK: Can you fix it ?
JONES: No way
BECK: Think ! Can we stop it ? ! Block it up ? ! Shut down the line somewhere ? ! Think !
JONES: I am thinking , man ! You think I want to die ! I am thinking ! I
BECK: No .

First , you gather up the many bills he dropped , to stop them from l owi ng away . Second , in an effort to get the name and number of someone to notify , you take his wallet . Finally , you leap into the man 's Lexus to head for assistance , when suddenly a police car speeds up . You breathe a sigh of elief `` Someone to look -afte the injured man ! Oh joy !

VIRGINIA: Only i t ' s . . . Like not true . Every word of it is a lie . Fletcher and Miranda exchange glances .
FLETCHER: Mrs. Cole , the only problem here is that after you 've provided years of faithful service and loving support , of aising his children They are his ?
VIRGINIA: H m ? Oh yeah . One for sure .
FLETCHER: After all that , your husband wants to deny you a fair share of the marital assets based on one single act of
VIRGINIA: Seven .

VIRGINIA: Seven single acts of indiscretion .
FLETCHER: Seven acts of indiscretion , only one of which he has any evidence of , and all of which he himself is responsible , for .
VIRGINIA: He is ?
FLETCHER: Mrs. Cole , I stayed up all night last night studying you c ase . Not just your case ut you . And , by now , I feel I know you . You are the victim here . The wife of a cold , distant businessman . Starved for affection , driven into the arms of another man
VIRGINIA: Seven .
FLETCHER: ( not missing a
BEAT: Seven .other men . You 're not trying to deny him what is ig htf ull y his . All you 're insisting on is what is ig htf ull y yours . And maybe an idgy-smidgy bit more . I think you 're bending ove ackwards .

FLETCHER: And you 've always been a good wife .
VIRGINIA: ( getting worked
UP: Yeah . . .

VIRGINIA: Yes ! I ' m tired of getting kicked around .

AUDREY: I ca n't move Max three thousand miles away from his father .
JERRY: Audrey , I have never said a ad word about your ex
AUDREY: I know .
JERRY: But how much responsibility does Fletcher take for Max , now ? He 'd never come over if you did n't remind him .
AUDREY: I know . But if they 're three thousand miles apart they 'll never see each other . Fletcher will never come to Boston and how can I send Max cross-country to him ?

BEGGAR: Could you spare some ?
FLETCHER: Unquestionably .
BEGGAR: Will you ?
FLETCHER: No .
BEGGAR: How come ?
FLETCHER: Because I resent you p re sen ce . You fill me with an unpleasant mixture of disgust and guilt . Further , I do n't elieve you 'll use the money for food , but I believe you 'll use it for , at worst , drugs , or , at best , whiskey , o . cigarettes . Also , I 'm cheap . As Fletcher heads up the stairs
BEGGAR: Jerkoff .
VIRGINIA: You look like you 're having a ough morning .
FLETCHER: I 've had better .
DANA: Good morning , Fletcher .
FLETCHER: Dana. ``
RICHARD: All right , Virginia , how much will it take to put an end to this ?
FLETCHER: Fifty per cent of your estate . Richard is SHOCKED .
DANA: Fifty per cent ? With a pre- nup and proof of adultery ? What 's your case ?
FLETCHER: Our case is simply this . . .
DANA: Let go !
FLETCHER: I 'm trying !
BAILIFF: All rise for the Honorable Judge William Stevens .
DANA: Very funny , Fletcher . You want to play hardball , I 'm game . JUDGE STEVENS takes the bench .
JUDGE STEVENS: Calling case BA 09395 , Richard Cole versus Virginia Cole . How 're we doing this morning , counsel ?
DANA: Fine , thank you .
JUDGE STEVENS: And you , Mr. Reid ?
FLETCHER: Well , I 'm a little upset about a bad sexual episode I had last night
DRYLY: Well , you 're still young . It 'll happen more and more . In the meantime , what do you say we get . down to business ? First , Mr. Reid , I see that your client was previously epresented by Mr. Rand of your office .
FLETCHER: Yes , Your Honor .
JUDGE STEVENS: I take it you 're seeking to substitute in as counsel ?
FLETCHER: Yes , Your Honor .
JUDGE STEVENS: Fine , fine . And for the ecord , the reason is ?
FLETCHER: Mr. Rand had severe ethical objections to my client 's case .
JUDGE STEVENS: I take it you do n't share the same ethical objections , Mr. Reid ?
FLETCHER: I have lower standards , You Honor .
JUDGE STEVENS: I see . Well , if Mrs. Cole wants the substitution of counsel , I 'll allow it . Is that what you want , Mrs. Cole ?
UNSURE: Yes ?
JUDGE STEVENS: Fine .
VIRGINIA: ( aside , to
FLETCHER: What are you doing ?
DESPERATION: Your Honor , I ' d like a continuance !
FLETCHER: I realize that , Your Honor , ut I ' d really , really , really like a continuance .
JUDGE STEVENS: I 'll have to hear good cause , counselor . What 's the problem ?
FLETCHER: I ca n't lie !
IMPATIENT: Commendable , Mr. Reid , but I 'm still waiting for the good caus e. Now , do you have it o . not ?
TRUTHFUL: Not .
JUDGE STEVENS: Motion for a continuance denied . Is there any chance of a settlement in this case ?
DANA: I do n't think so , Your Honor . Mr. Reid made it abundantly clear that the last thing in the world he wanted was to
JUDGE STEVENS: There appears to have been a change in strategy . Let 's go to my chambers and negotiate . He BANGS the gavel .
DANA: Your Honor , under the terms of the prenuptual agreement , if Mrs. Cole commits adultery , she is entitled to nothing . We have in our possession an audiotape made by a licensed private investigator of an explicit act of sexual congress with a man who is not her husband .
JUDGE STEVENS: Sounds pretty damning , Mr. Reid .
FLETCHER: It certainly does .
DANA: However , my client has no desire to see his ex-wife destitute . Against my advice , he 's willing to offer her a cash settlement of.two point four million dollars .
JUDGE STEVENS: Two four seems like a pretty fair offer , Mr. Reid .
FLETCHER: Fantastically fair . Phenominally fair . In fact , I 'd say beyond fair , bordering on stupid .
JUDGE STEVENS: What are you suggesting , Mr. Rei d ? That Ms. Appleton 's willingness to proffer such an offer betrays a lack of faith in her position ?
FLETCHER: No , not at all . She 's got my client dead to rights . When
DANA: Can the sarcasm , Reid . All ight , I admit it I 've seen you make even the lamest case fly . But this time I have you . Even Clarence Darrow could n't explain this away . She brandishes the audiotape .
JUDGE SAMIOAN: Wel l , Mr. Reid ? without a dynamite explanation , I 'd say you 're dead in the water . How 's you client 's story ?
FLETCHER: The best that money can buy , Y o u r Honor . ·
JUDGE STEVENS: Strong corroborating evidence ?
FLETCHER: We have evidence that you are not going to-believe .
JUDGE STEVENS: You 're pretty confident how this trial is going to come out , eh , Mr. Reid ?
FLETCHER: . `` Confident '' is too weak a word , Your Honor . I am certain what will happen if I take this puppy to trial . The verdict will be a stunning , humiliating defeat that will cut a spectacularly promising legal career off at the knees .
DANA: All right ! Double the offer ! Four point eight ! And not a penny more . ( venomous , to
FLETCHER: Bastard !
JUDGE STEVENS: You are some negotiator , Mr. Reid . If your client has half a brain , she 'll jump at the offer .
VIRGINIA: No !
FLETCHER: No ? ! Mrs. Cole , this offe was a miracle . I 'm talking about a walking-on-water , Lazarus-rising-from-the-dead ,
WATCH: four minutes . Think of it this way now you 're getting paid seven hundred thou pe schtupp !
VIRGINIA: Mr. Reid , you convinced me yesterday I 'm the victim here , starved for affection , driven into the arms of another man
FLETCHER: Seven ! ·
VIRGINIA: Seven other men . With the story you came up with , I do n't think I can lose . I want to proceed .
FLETCHER: Mrs. Cole , you do n't · . understand , I
JUDGE STEVENS: Well , Mr. Reid . Do we have a settlement ?
JANE: What do you think ?

RESIGNED: Tell her I 'm a thoughtless son who 'd rather spend ten hours clogging the wheels of justice than five minutes talking to her but only if she asks . You.might also add that she deserves better , though I hope to God you do n't .
GRETA: Thanks for clearing that up . And that 's it , except your ex called and asked when you were cowing over to see your son .
AUDREY': Hey , Fletcher . T was wondering if you were going to still pick up Max after school today .

ANGRIER: Nothing ! Because if I take you to small-claims court , it will just drain eight hours out of my life , and you probably wo n't show up , and if I finally got the judgment you 'd just stiff me anyway , so what I 'm gon na do is piss and moan like an impotent jerk and . then bend over and take it up the tail pipe !

FLETCHER: I help people fight over thei money and their children .
THEODORE: Ca n't they fight without you ?

To cling to an illusion of youth as his body gives way to sore backs , flat feet , spare tires , gum disease , hair loss , liver spots , kidney stones , clogged arteries , diabetes , goiter and eventual death . The kids EYES GO WIDE . A moment , then
BRIGHTLY: Well , I think it 's time fo fingerpainting .
FLETCHER: Monster-Max .

MAX: So you can lie ?
FLETCHER: Not to you .
MAX: To who ?
FLETCHER: Max , sometimes grownups need to lie . It 's hard to explain , but i f . . . Look , here 's an example . When Mommy was pregnant with you , she gained a little weight . Se venty pounds . I thought she was gon na give birth to a car . But she 'd say to me `` How do I lo ok ? '' So I 'd say , `` Oh , honey , you 're beautiful , you 're glowing.11 Otherwise , I would 've hurt Mommy 's fee ling s. Understand ? Max nods .
MAX: You did n't think she was eautiful .
FLETCHER: Right . No Max , I do n't know how to get along in the grown-up world if I have to stick to the truth . I could lose my case , I could lose my promotion , I could even lose , my job Do you understand ? Max shakes his head `` no . ''

FLETCHER: Great ! Great ! Now to test
MAX: Did it work ?
CHEEK: Not like I ' d hoped . Did you eally unwish it ? Max nods .

FLETCHER: Well , then do it again . Only this time , mean it .
MAX: I ca n't .
FLETCHER: Why not ? !
MAX: Because I do n't want you to lie .
FLETCHER: I explained this to you ! I have to lie . Everybody lies ! Mommy lies , even the wonderful Jerry lies
MAX: But you 're the only one who makes me feel bad .
CALLING: Max , recess 'is over , come on in .
MAX: I have to go .
FLETCHER: I am coming over , tonight , Max . You believe me , do n't you ? Max hesitates , then nods .

FLETCHER: That 's right ! I am incapable of lying .
GRETA: Just today ?
FLETCHER: Apparently until 9 15 tonight . It 's a twenty-four hour curse .
GRETA: Yes , those are going around .
FLETCHER: You do n't believe me .
GRETA: Of course not .
FLETCHER: Go ahead . Ask me something I ' d normally lie about . She thinks .
GRETA: A ll right . Remember a few months ago , I wanted a raise
QUICKLY: Forget it . Let 's not do this .
GRETA: and the firm wouldn't.give me one . And I asked you if you would give it to me out of your own pocket and you said the company would n't permit it ecause it creates jealousy among the other secretaries ? Was that true or did you just not want to pony up the dough ?

FLETCHER: Then why are you always trying to socialize with me ?
PHILIP: You 're a client . I figured if I did n't try to be you friend , you 'd get a new accountant .
FLETCHER: Philip , I do n't like you as a person , but I 'm crazy about you as my accountant . I ' d never hire a new accountant . Never !

FLETCHER: Just let me present my case .
BEAT: You mad at me ?
FLETCHER: You wanted me to stop lying . But lying is n't the problem . .. Why we lie ~ that 's the problem . Sometimes we lie to make someone else feel better . But sometimes we lie because the truth gets in our way But being an adult means you sacrifice some things for more
MAX: He 's telling the truth , Mom . He 's not allowed to lie . I made a wish and anything Dad says has to be the truth . .. Right ? But Fletcher 's looking at his watch

BOUNCER: Oh , no , Ray . Not tonight . Spanky 's not happy with you .
RAY: Is Spanky here ?
BOUNCER: No , but
RAY: Then what 's the problem ?
BOUNCER: Do yourself a favor and find anothe place where they let you in the front door .
RAY: But this is where the action is and I have to be where the action is . Look , when your old lady wanted those alligator shoes , did n't I come through for you ? Ai n't she stepping in style now ?
BOUNCER: Yeah
RAY: Well , alright then . What do you think about this new tie ?
BOUNCER: Sharp .

BARKEEP: I ca n't give you a glass of ice . I ca n't give you anything until you pay your damn tab .
CLAUDE: For the kind of money they charge here , you 'd think they could hire somebody to actually wash the dishes .
DAISY: Claude . Here 's to your new job down at the bank . I always knew you 'd make something of yourself .
CLAUDE: Know what I 'm going to buy with my first pay check ?
DAISY: I was hoping you were gon na say an engagement ring , Claude . French Champagne shoots out of Claude 's nose .
CLAUDE: Engagement ring !
DAISY: That 's what respectable folks do . Get a job , get married , start having abies . That 's what you want , is n't it ?
CLAUDE: Sure it is . I just do n't see any eason to rush into things . Damn , look at this shirt . I 'll be right ack .
RAY: You have any of that French stuff ?
ATTENDENT: Here you go .
RAY: Keep the change .
ATTENDENT: Why , thank you , sir !
RAY: Do n't I know you ?
CLAUDE: I do n't think so .
RAY: Sure I do . What 's your name again ?
CLAUDE: Claude Banks .
RAY: Claude Banks . How could I forget that ? You 've got to remember me . Ray Gibson . We went to high school together .
CLAUDE: You went to Monroe ?
RAY: That 's right ! Good old Monroe
CLAUDE: Well , I went to Jefferson , so you must have a different Claude Banks in mind .
RAY: Sorry , man . My mistake .
BULLETHEAD: This ai n't about your tab , Ray . You 've got bigger problems than that .
BOUNCER: Is that Ray Gibson ? Who the hell let him in here ?
CLAUDE: Come on , honey , let 's get out of here .
DAISY: But I 'm having a good time
WAITER: Excuse me , sir , I believe you forgot this . The waiter presents Claude with the bill .
CLAUDE: The bill . Of course , the bill . We could n't leave without paying the ill . Especially such an incredibly large bill .
RAY: Save your energy , Claude . You 're gon na need it .
CLAUDE: Good old Monroe .
RAY: What I want to know is what happened to your cush between the time that you got up from the table and when I caught up with you in the Johnny ?
CLAUDE: I do n't see where that 's any of you usiness .
RAY: Did those two muscle heads shake you down ? Swear I 've seen them down at the track with Sure-shot Riley . That 's it , ai n't it ? A gambling debt .
CLAUDE: Where they taking us , anyway ?
RAY: Probably to Spanky 's headquarters down at the pier .
CLAUDE: Good , I 'm looking forward to meeting this Spanky . Give me a chance to straighten out this whole mess .
RAY: I ca n't wait to see that . You slay me , man .
CLAUDE: What are they gon na do to us ?
RAY: You ? Dine and ditch , right ? Over ten bucks ? You 're probably looking at a thumb .
CLAUDE: A thumb ? What do you mean , like cut it off ? For ten bucks ? That include the tip ?
SPANKY: You picked the wrong night to fuck with me , Ray . I just lost three men and a truck full of Canadian whiskey . You know what that kind of thing does to my business ? It makes me want to lash out and hurt somebody .
CLAUDE: I never saw this man before tonight . He 's a lowlife degenerate who lurks in bathrooms . I 'm a professional man , an upstanding citizen . I go to church on Sunday .
SPANKY: Then what are you doing here ?
BULLETHEAD: Failure to pay .
CLAUDE: Look , Mr. Johnson , you seem like a easonable man . I got a good jo starts Monday . I 'll pay you back with my first pay check . With interest . I do n't want to tell you how to conduct your business , but if you cut off my finger you wo n't get jack . Working an adding machine , I got ta be whole . I need my thumbs and all my fingers for praying and doing good Spanky holds up a hand , silencing Claude .
SPANKY: The choirboy wants to keep his fingers . Who am I to argue ? Drop him .
CLAUDE: Drop him ? What does drop him mean ?
SPANKY: You got ta lotta balls showing you face around my club . If a man 's gon na un numbers on my side of Broadway , you think he 'd have the common sense to keep a low profile . But not Ray Gibson .
CLAUDE: No , not down there ! That water 's filthy ! Help me out here , man !
RAY: You do n't have to drown that fella , Spanky . You already scared him half to death . He did n't know who he was fucking with .
SPANKY: But you do . What does that say about you , Ray ? What does that say about me ? I 've given you a lot of leeway over the years on account of you father . But he did n't last long enough to teach you the meaning of the word espect so I guess I 'm gon na have to school you myself .
RAY: Come on , Spank , I 'm just trying to get by here . You remember how it was when you were starting out .
CLAUDE: I was supposed to wear this suit on Monday !
SPANKY: What 's that , some of your bathtu ew ?
RAY: Puerto Rican rum . See for yourself .
SPANKY: Where 'd you get this ?
RAY: Comes up the Mississippi . I can get more . A lot more . I was thinking about going into business for myself , ut under the circumstances , I 'd be willing to take on a partner .
SPANKY: I 'm interested . Keep talking .
RAY: All I need is the front money and a truck . I could be back in two , three days tops if I had somebody to share the driving .
SPANKY: If you fuck me on this one , I 'll spare no expense .
RAY: Understood .
SPANKY: Alright , Ray , you 've got a deal . Pick your man and get going .
RAY: I 'll take the little choirboy , if you do n't mind .
SPANKY: If I was you , I 'd want somebody who can handle himself in a tight spot .
RAY: I just want somebody who wo n't put a ullet in my back once the truck is full .
SPANKY: For your sake , I hope you can drive . Somebody give him some dry clothes .
RAY: Tell me about that hot sketch you were hypin ' last night . She was a choice bit of calico . You two been seeing each other a long time ? Gon na slap the handcuffs on her and stroll down the aisle one of these days ? Tight-lipped , Claude shifts in his seat .
CLAUDE: Look , man , I do n't want friendly conversation . I do n't want to be your friend . I 've seen your friends and I do n't like them . I just want to do this thing and get back to New York in time to start my job .
RAY: Start your job ? What kind of job ?
CLAUDE: Well , if you must know , bank telle at First Federal of Manhattan . I 'm esponsible for keeping track of hundreds , occasionally thousands of dollars .
RAY: That 's some long green .
CLAUDE: Damn straight , it is . I got my own set of keys because I 'm supposed to open up . So if I ai n't there 8 a.m. Monday morning , there 's gon na be hell to pay . Beat of silence . Ray laughs to himself .
RAY: Nothing .
CLAUDE: No , tell me what 's so funny .
RAY: I do n't know . Bank teller . Sounds like ladies work to me .
CLAUDE: Well , maybe I should dig around in other people 's clothes for money . It 's obviously been highly successful for you .
RAY: Hey , you 'd be surprised what you find in other people 's pockets . Just got ta avoid them deadbeat bank tellers . Get you every time .
CLAUDE: I did n't start out to be a bank teller . I was gon na be a ballplayer . Even had an offer to play short fo the Newark Eagles .
RAY: Why did n't you take it ?
CLAUDE: The Negro League do n't pay so good . And you 're always on the road . That do n't wash with Daisy .
RAY: You gave up baseball to be a bank teller ? I ca n't latch on to that .
CLAUDE: At some point a man 's got to get serious about his future . I 'm sure you have no idea what I 'm talking about .
RAY: You 're talking about giving up aseball to be a bank teller .
CLAUDE: Bank teller 's just a start . I got plans . Real plans . Not opening some Zoom-Boom Room . This time next yea I 'll be a loan officer .
RAY: A loan officer ?
CLAUDE: That 's right , a loan officer .
RAY: So you mean , if I needed some jack to get my nightclub up and running , I 'd have to hype some square like you ?
CLAUDE: Uh-huh .
RAY: How would I get a loan , anyway ?
CLAUDE: You need collateral .
RAY: Like this ?
CLAUDE: That thing ? Who 'd you steal it from ?
RAY: My daddy gave me this watch .
CLAUDE: Yeah ? Who 'd he steal it from ?
RAY: My daddy is dead so watch your mouth . You can say what you want about me , ut do n't be dragging my daddy into it . This watch means the world to me . Solid gold . Keeps perfect time .
CLAUDE: Looks like a fake to me . Loan denied !
RAY: Ah , go chase yourself . I 'll take my usiness elsewhere . And for future eference , you are no longer welcome at Ray 's Boom-Boom Room .
CLAUDE: There is no Boom-Boom Room .
RAY: When there is , you can forget about it . And I swear to God , you eve talk about my daddy again I 'm gon na kick your bank-telling , loan-denying ass , you got me ?
CLAUDE: Oooh
RAY: I think I liked you better when you kept your trap shut .
CLAUDE: Maybe we oughta find another place .
RAY: Are you kidding ? Tell me you do n't want a slice of that pie right ove there .
CLAUDE: I must have left my appetite outside , which is where I think we ought to e right now .
RAY: Good evening , Billy . We 'd like some coffee and a couple of slices of that homemade pie you 've got advertised .
BILLY: How you know my name 's Billy ?
RAY: It says so right there on your shirt .
BILLY: That what that says ?
MAMA: If you boys can read so good , how come you missed that sign in the window ? Claude considers the sign she 's pointing to .
CLAUDE: You mean this sign ? The one that says `` No Coloreds Allowed . '' That 's a good question . Ray , how come we missed the sign ?
RAY: Look , ma'am , we 've been driving all day . We 'd just like to purchase one of those pies and we 'll be on ou way .
MAMA: Those are whites-only pies .
RAY: Got any nigger pies ? Claude jabs him .
CLAUDE: Any fool could see those are whites- only , not-for-blacks , come-on-let's- get-the-fuck-outta-here pies . Thank you very much . Claude starts tugging Ray toward the door .
RAY: Thanks for backing me up here , Uncle Claude .
CLAUDE: Do n't Uncle Claude me . You get a load of those crackers ? Could n't be a mouthful of teeth among the bunch of 'em . Why you want to pick a fight with people like that for ?
RAY: You 're soft .
CLAUDE: What 'd you say ? Diner patrons stare .
RAY: I said you 're soft .
CLAUDE: Hey , man , do n't ever call me that .
RAY: I call it like I see it , and what I see is definitely soft . Claude narrows his eyes .
CLAUDE: Alright . You want some pie ?
RAY: Yeah , I want some pie .
CLAUDE: Okay then , I 'm gon na walk over to that counter and get us some fucking pie . Resolved , Claude stomps over to the counter .
MAMA: And I bet this right here will turn you into a colored pie .
CLAUDE: Okay , Ray , I think we can go now . Much obliged
MAMA: Do n't be concentrating so hard , baby . You 're liable to seize yourself again .
RAY: How you doing ? We 're looking fo Slim .
SLIM: You found him . Ray cocks an eyebrow .
RAY: Man , that music is hot . What goes on down there , Slim ?
SLIM: That 's Natchez-under-the-Hill .
RAY: Blacks welcome there ?
SLIM: Green 's the only color that matters under the hill . They got gambling , girls . You oughta check it out .
RAY: Maybe we will . Nice meeting you . Slim slips into the shadows .
CLAUDE: Nice meeting you ? You 've been here efore , have n't you ?
RAY: What gave you that idea ?
CLAUDE: Oh , I do n't know , maybe because ou lives depend on it , I just sort of thought you knew what you were doing !
RAY: Do n't get all agitated on me . I bought a bottle of rum from a couple of dudes , I heard 'em talking
CLAUDE: Let me get this straight . We drove all the way down to Klan country 'cause you heard a couple of guys talking ?
RAY: What are you complaining about ? It worked out . Everything 's cool . Now , come on , let 's head down there and see what 's shaking . We deserve a little reward .
CLAUDE: Reward ?
RAY: There are people down there having fun . I want to be one of them . I want you to be one of them . On Monday you can be a bank teller if you want , ut tonight you 're a bootlegger with a truck full of Puerto Rican rum and a fistful of cash .
CLAUDE: That 's gas money .
RAY: There 's your gas money . You stay here and watch the truck . And do n't worry , I 've got the keys .
CLAUDE: I 'm just gon na keep an eye on you , make sure you do n't do nothing stupid .
SYLVIA: I 've never seen you in here before .
CLAUDE: That 's because I 've never been here efore .
SYLVIA: I 'm Sylvia . What 's your name ?
CLAUDE: I know it begins with a `` C ''
SYLVIA: Well , Mr. `` C '' , how about buying a girl a drink ? Two bourbons .
CLAUDE: I really should n't . I got ta keep an eye on my friend .
SYLVIA: He looks like he can take care of himself .
CLAUDE: Claude . That 's my name . Claude . That 's never happened before .
SYLVIA: You 're cute . You have any money , Claude ?
CLAUDE: Ten dollars . But I need it to get home .
SYLVIA: Why would you want to go home ? It 's so early . The bartender refills their glasses .
RAY: I 'll take two . The dealer tosses Ray a couple of cards .
WINSTON: I 'll see that
RAY: Looks like my sugar bowl 's empty , Mr. Hancock .
WINSTON: That 's just too damn bad , ai n't it ?
RAY: Now , hang on , slick . I ai n't through with you yet .
WINSTON: That 'll cover it . Ray lays down his hand .
RAY: Full boat , ladies doing the paddling .
WINSTON: Four threes .
WAITRESS: Can I get you something ?
RAY: Looks like he had a whole lot of nothing in his hand until you came along .
WAITRESS: You 're hurting my arm .
PIKE: If it is n't Winston Hancock .
WINSTON: I tried to leave , Sheriff Pike . But your wife begged me to stay .
PIKE: You just committed suicide , boy .
CLAUDE: Hey , Ray . I 've been looking for you .
RAY: Here I am .
CLAUDE: Guess we better get going , huh ?
RAY: Still got that ten dollars ?
CLAUDE: Well , not exactly . See , I met this girl . Real nice girl . God-fearing girl . Her name 's Sylvia .
RAY: That jelly you were talking to right here ?
CLAUDE: She 's in a tight spot . Her mama needs this operation , and they ai n't got the money for it . Their church took up a collection but they were still short
RAY: So you made a generous contribution .
CLAUDE: What can I say ? When the spirit moves me .
RAY: That was mighty charitable of you , Claude . Looks like we both got fucked tonight .
CLAUDE: What are you talking about ?
RAY: While you were upstairs doing God 's work , I was getting jack-legged by a fool with four threes .
CLAUDE: You lost all our money in a card game ?
RAY: He even got my daddy 's watch .
CLAUDE: Fuck that cheap-ass watch I mean , how the hell are we gon na get home without any money ?
RAY: We 've still got 36 cases of rum . That 's better than money .
CLAUDE: You sure the truck 's this way ? I swear it was back that way .
RAY: He 's dead .
CLAUDE: Oh , man , I 've never seen a dead body efore !
RAY: It ai n't here .
CLAUDE: What ai n't there ?
RAY: My daddy 's watch . This is the dude I was telling you about
CLAUDE: Yeah , nobody puts 'em away like old what's-his-name .
RAY: Winston . His name 's Winston .
CLAUDE: Come on , Ray , better get Winston ack to the truck .
RAY: Hell with him then . If he ca n't share the driving , he ca n't ride in the truck .
CLAUDE: Spanky 's gon na be pissed ? Poor Spanky . Fuck Spanky ! What the hell kind of a name is Spanky , anyway ? You 're esponsible for this situation . I lame you for everything . If it was n't for you , I 'd be home having a hot meal right now .
RAY: If it was n't for me , you 'd be washing up on the beach at Coney Island right now . `` I need all my thumbs and fingers for praying and doing good . ''
PIKE: What do we have here ?
DEPUTY: Billy Bob and the boys found them down down under the hill with Winston Hancock . He was dead . Looks like murder .
PIKE: You do n't say .
DEPUTY: Looks like they was running rum . Got thirty six cases of evidence out ack . You want I should call in the federal prosecutor ?
PIKE: Let 's not drag the feds into this . I can think of better uses for that um than letting it collect dust in some government warehouse up in Nashville .
RAY: Excuse me , sheriff . As we explained to your associate here , there 's been a mistake . We did n't kill anybody . Now , as for the bootlegging , we happen to work for a very important man in New York .
CLAUDE: That 's right . Does the name Spanky Johnson mean anything to you ?
PIKE: Afraid not .
RAY: Mr. Johnson is very well connected . If you were to let us go , I guarantee he would show you his appreciation , if you know what I mean .
PIKE: Are you offering me a bribe ?
RAY: I 'm just trying to pay the toll on the road to justice .
PIKE: You may be able to buy your way out of trouble up in New York City , but down here we take murder seriously .
CLAUDE: Look , man , how many times we got ta tell you people , we did n't kill that guy !
PIKE: Well , if that 's the case , then you do n't have anything to worry about , do you ?
CLAUDE: The man 's got ta point . We 're innocent , after all . I just got ta get a good night 's sleep on this filthy mattress . Keep our heads on straight , stay cool , what 's the worst thing that could happen to us ?
JUDGE: Life !
RAY: Life ? ! How long is life ? We were just walking back to the truck . We did n't do nothing ! Fuck life !
CLAUDE: Life ? ! What 's life mean ? There 's no way I can do life . I got a job starts Monday morning !
DILLARD: This here is Camp 8 . Camp 8 is fo incorrigibles , so whatever you 've done to get here , believe me , we 're not impressed . You new men are probably noticing that we have no fences here at Camp 8 . We do n't need no fences , we have the gun line . It uns from shack to shack clear around the yard . You are now inside the gun line . If you step outside the gun line without my permission , you will e shot . If you trip and fall ove the gun line , you will be shot .

HOPPIN' BOB: New men , strip down !
DILLARD: Got three miles of ditch to clea today . Let 's keep it moving !
CLAUDE: I do n't believe this before Abe jive . I did n't go to night school to sing in no Mississippi Boys Choir !
RAY: I would n't do that if I was you .
CLAUDE: Shut up . It 's too damn hot . What do you know , anyway ?
RAY: Told ya .
DILLARD: Why ai n't his pick swinging ?
HOPPIN' BOB: Why ai n't that pick swinging ?
CLAUDE: It 's too hot , boss . I 'm tired .
HOPPIN' BOB: He says it 's too hot , boss .

ABERNATHY: It 's a boy ! Well , let 's get a look at him .
POKER FACE: You really think they 'll let him out of here just to play baseball ?
WILLIE: Why not ? Boy 's got God-given talent .
CLAUDE: God may have given it , but Claude Banks spotted it and nurtured it .
RAY: Damn straight . I expect those Pittsburgh Crawdads to remember that .
CLAUDE: Crawfords .
RAY: Whatever .
COOKIE: Heads up , here comes trouble .
DILLARD: Alright , listen up ! I want every man lined up out here in the yard on the double ! Let 's move it !
HOPPIN' BOB: You heard what the man said ! Move it !
ABERNATHY: I know it was somebody from this camp . I can feel it in my bones .
RAY: The baby 's mine , boss .
CLAUDE: He 's lying , boss . I 'm the father of that baby .
WILLIE: Actually , it was me , boss . I know I may look old
BISCUIT: Any fool could see that baby 's mine , oss .
COOKIE: I beg to differ . That cute little ascal belongs to me
POKER FACE: I 'm the father
RADIO: I 'm the father , boss
GOLDMOUTH: I 'm the father
JANGLE LEG: I 'm the father
WILLIE: To Superintendent Abernathy . May he have many more grandchildren !
CLAUDE: What I want to know is where ? When ? How ?
WILLIE: Wasting your breath , Claude . He ai n't the type to kiss and tell .
REV. CLAY: There 's a sweet fragrance in the ai today .
CLAY'S DAUGHTER: The magnolias are blooming early this year , daddy .
RAY: Do n't take it so hard , Biscuit . She do n't mean nothin ' to him .
BISCUIT: Hell with him . It ai n't that .
RAY: These are free papers .
BISCUIT: What am I gon na do out there , Ray ? I ca n't go home to my mama like this . I 'll get the strap for sure .
RAY: Come on , Biscuit , this is good news . Your mama 's gon na break down in tears when you show up on her doorstep . Poker Face leans in .
POKER FACE: I 'll give you three to one she gives him the strap .
RAY: It 's 1945 . It 's a different world now .
BISCUIT: Not for me , it ai n't .
RAY: Well you ca n't stay here , Biscuit . This ai n't no life for a man . Any one of these fellas would give thei ight arm to be in your shoes . I sure know I would .
BISCUIT: No life on the inside , no life on the outside
RAY: Hey , Biscuit !
TRUSTY: Man over the line !
DILLARD: Goddamnit , Biscuit , get back here !
RADIO: Hey , fellas , I got Chicago .
CLAUDE: Hey , Ca n't Get Right , where you going ? Why you dressed like that ?
RAY: It 's a pardon from the governor .
CLAUDE: Let me see that .
BLOCKER: Kid 's getting out . I got him a pardon .
CLAUDE: Yeah , but what about me and Ray ? I did n't see our names on that pardon . You said you were gon na put in a good word for us .
BLOCKER: I did , Claude . I mentioned you . I mentioned you both . But the fact is , pardons do n't come cheap . The kid can hit . What can you do ? This hits Claude hard .
RAY: Let it go , Claude .
CLAUDE: I 'm not gon na let it go . The man needs to explain himself . Makin ' promises .
BLOCKER: Look , I am truly sorry about this . I 'd like to help you
CLAUDE: But you ca n't .
BLOCKER: At least the kid 's getting out . Is n't this what you wanted ?
CLAUDE: Yeah . Of course it is .
RAY: Make 'em throw strikes .
DILLARD: It 's alright . You 're a free man now .
BLOCKER: Do n't worry , we 'll take good care of him .
RAY: One of the new kids said they 're farming those acres just north of the swamp . He said he saw a crop duster flying around the place .
CLAUDE: I 'm not in the mood right now , Ray .
RAY: He said they keep it parked out behind the barn . Ca n't be that hard to fly a plane . Lots of people do it .
CLAUDE: They 're called pilots ! I 'm serious , Ray . I 'm not in the mood for one of your stupid , fucked-up plans right now .
RAY: I do n't see you coming up with any plans .
CLAUDE: My plan is on his way to Pittsburgh ight now . That congenital idiot just got himself a pardon signed by the governor thanks to us , but we ca n't seem to do nothing fo ourselves . Do n't you feel a little disgusted right now ?
RAY: Crop duster .
CLAUDE: I ai n't getting in no airplane with you . I 'm finally wrapping my mind around the concept . They threw us in this shithole for life . Do n't you get it , Ray ? We 're gon na die here ! Might as well head up to the cemetery , pick a plot and start digging .
RAY: My daddy died in prison . He gave up hope and hung himself . What you 're talking about is the same damn thing . That ai n't how I 'm going .
CLAUDE: Maybe you 're fooling yourself , Ray . Maybe you 're just a chip off the old lock .
RAY: Take that back or we ai n't friends no more , Claude Banks .
CLAUDE: Here 's a news flash , Ray . We neve were friends . We 've just been stuck together for 12 years . It 's been nothing but bad luck since the moment I ran into you . Every time I look at you I get sick to my stomach thinking about what my life could have been if I 'd never bumped into Ray Gibson .
RAY: Better watch yourself Claude , before you say something you regret .
CLAUDE: The only thing I regret is the day I met you .
RAY: Well , if that 's the way it is
CLAUDE: That 's the way it is .
RAY: Then I have nothing left to say to you .
CLAUDE: You never said nothing of value anyway .
RAY: Alright Willie , I think I got everything . I 'll talk to Dillard , see if I can get up to the infirmary and check up on you . Make sure they 're changing your diapers regular .
WILLIE: They 'll be sending you up there soon enough . And not just for a visit , neither .
RAY: I slipped in a couple of bottles of my latest batch . Help wash down all them pills they 'll be giving you .
YVETTE: Are you Claude Banks ?
CLAUDE: Yeah .
YVETTE: My name 's Yvette . Sylvia sent me . You look just like she said .
CLAUDE: She 's alright , is n't she ?
YVETTE: Oh , she 's fine . She 's just not coming today .
CLAUDE: Why not ?
YVETTE: She got married last month .
CLAUDE: Married ?
YVETTE: Real nice guy , too . Trumpet player . They moved down to New Orleans . Claude takes this in , staring off into space .
CLAUDE: But I 'm not on the outside . I 'm in here .
YVETTE: I know she 's sorry she wo n't be seeing you anymore . Anyway , she wanted me to take care of you .
CLAUDE: Take care of me ?
YVETTE: You know , go to the tonk or whatever .
CLAUDE: I 'm too old for you . Besides , I 'm not much in the mood .
YVETTE: Want me to come back some other time ?
CLAUDE: Nice girl like you do n't belong in a place like this . But if you talk to Sylvia , tell her old Claude said congratulations .
TRUSTY: Man over the line !
DILLARD: Comfortable ?
CLAUDE: As a pair of fur-lined bedroom slippers , boss .
DILLARD: We 'll see what those slippers feel like after , say , 24 hours . And if you step down off them bottles if one toe so much as touches the dirt one of these boys is gon na shoot you dead . Let 's see . We need a special man for this job .
RAY: You do n't want to give me a gun , oss . I 'm liable to use it on you .
CLAUDE: You 're a sucker . I 'd have taken that deal .
RAY: Excuse me ? Are you talking to me ?
CLAUDE: I 'd have knocked you off those ottles , put a bullet in your ass and be half way to New York right now .
RAY: After all these years of blissful silence , I almost forgot how annoying the sound of your voice can be .
CLAUDE: I hope you do n't think I owe you anything . Because I do n't owe you a damn thing .
RAY: I did n't do if for you , anyway . I just ai n't no boot-licking trusty , that 's all .
CLAUDE: I was sorry to hear about your mama passing .
RAY: That was five years ago .
CLAUDE: I know , but since we 're talking , I thought I 'd mention it .
RAY: We 're not talking , you 're talking , and doing too damn much of it , if you ask me .
CLAUDE: What ? !
RAY: You sure looked funny running fo those pies , bullets flying all around you .
CLAUDE: Bullets were n't the problem . That pie was too hot . Burned my tongue .
DILLARD: Fourteen acres today and only 12 hours of daylight ! Eat up and move it out ! Gibson ! Banks ! Get your sorry asses over here !
RAY: I always wanted to do that . There is so much love inside of this man .
CLAUDE: Oh , yard boy , these pansies could use some attention over here . Perhaps some fertilizer would restore thei exuberance .
WILKINS: Damn dentures slipping again . Everything falls apart when you grow old , eh , Claude ? Time sure marches on .
CLAUDE: Yes , boss .
WILKINS: You know , I 'm fixing on retiring at the end of the summer , gon na try to enjoy what few years I have left . What do you think of this place ? It 's one of those new retirement communities down on the Gulf .
CLAUDE: Ocean views , palm trees , two heated swimming pools and a golf course sounds a damn sight better than that infirmary across the way where I 'm gon na end up . Claude returns the brochure .
WILKINS: I apologize , Claude . That was rude of me .
CLAUDE: That 's alright , boss . Takes a lot more than a colorful brochure to hurt my feelings .
WILKINS: You been on the farm for quite a spell , have n't you ?
CLAUDE: Over forty years now . Me and Ray Gibson out there .
WILKINS: Forty years . That 's a long time fo any crime , even murder .
CLAUDE: It 's a hell of a lot longer when you 're innocent .
WILKINS: Half the men in this prison swea they 're innocent . Do n't you think that 's kinda funny ?
CLAUDE: You have to forgive me if I do n't laugh .
RAY: You and Wilkins sure are getting chummy . You two planning on going steady , or something ?
CLAUDE: He 's just a lonely old man . He likes to talk .
RAY: Hey , I 'm a lonely old man . I like to talk , too . So why do n't we start by talking about what kind of a plan you 're working on ?
CLAUDE: I 'm not working on a plan .
RAY: You ca n't fool me , Claude . I know you got something brewing .
CLAUDE: Goodnight , Ray .
RAY: What the hell are you doing ?
CLAUDE: Do n't touch that car .
RAY: You have n't driven in 40 years , you ai n't even got a license . Man 's taking his life in his hands , putting you ehind the wheel ! Where you taking him ?
CLAUDE: Greenville . We 're picking up the new Superintendent at the bus station .
WILKINS: You know I trust you , Claude .
CLAUDE: Yes , sir .
WILKINS: I 'll be right back .
RAY: Damn , it was getting hot in there .
CLAUDE: What the hell are you doing in that trunk ? !
RAY: You did n't think I was gon na let you escape alone , did you ?
CLAUDE: I ai n't escaping ! We 're picking up the new super just like I told you .
RAY: Then you 're lucky I came along . Does n't take a visionary to spot a golden opportunity like this . Now help me out of this trunk .
CLAUDE: You ai n't getting out of that trunk .
RAY: Come on , man , I 'm starting to cramp up here . We have the chance right here , right now , I say we go !
CLAUDE: Go where , Ray ?
RAY: Back to New York for starters .
CLAUDE: And what will we do when we get there ? I 'm sixty-five years old , Ray . So are you . What are we gon na do out here ? Get married , have kids , settle down ? That boat sailed without us , man .
RAY: This boat 's gon na sail without you , too . I do n't care if I last one day out here . At least it 's one day of freedom . Now gim me those keys .
CLAUDE: Forget about that . You run if you want to , but you 're not taking this car .
RAY: Claude , man , I 'm serious . Give me those keys .
CLAUDE: I ai n't spending a month in the hole so you can take a joy ride .
RAY: Do n't make me take them away from you .
CLAUDE: Hey , there 's Wilkins !
PIKE: There you go , boy .
WILKINS: Come on , Claude , time to go .
RAY: You sure it was him ?
CLAUDE: Some faces you just do n't forget . Warren Pike 's is one of 'em .
RAY: I do n't like it , I do n't like it one it . We shoulda taken that car when we had the opportunity . We 'd be half way to New York by now .
CLAUDE: We 'd be in the hole by now . Hey , man , you 're peeing on my shoe .
RAY: I know . Simultaneously , they shake and zip . Claude bends down and picks up a bowl of gumbo , placing it on a tray next to an identical one .
WILKINS: Lemonade ?
PIKE: I prefer bourbon .
WILKINS: I 'm sorry , I do n't keep any liquo in the house .
PIKE: Well , fortunately , I carry my own .
WILKINS: Hunting 's been pretty good on the farm the last few years . It 's one of the perks of the job . If you 're interested , tomorrow I could show you some of my favorite spots .
PIKE: You do n't have to twist my arm . Say now , that gumbo has quite a kick .
WILKINS: Thank you , Claude . That 'll be all for tonight .
CLAUDE: Goodnight , Mr. Wilkins . Mr. Pike .
WILKINS: Goodnight , Claude .
PIKE: If you do n't mind my saying , you seem mighty familiar with your house oy .
WILKINS: I believe in treating the convicts with respect , if that 's what you mean .
PIKE: Respect ? Well , is n't that progressive .
WILKINS: If somebody deserves respect , Mr. Pike , they receive it from me , convict or no convict .
PIKE: Yeah , it 's getting late . I could sure use a bath .
RAY: That 's a real nice watch you got there , sir . Fancy old thing even plays a little tune .
PIKE: Yeah , it 's special . They do n't make 'em like this anymore .
RAY: Sure do n't . Mind if I ask where you got it ?
PIKE: Why , my wife gave it to me on ou anniversary some years back .
RAY: Must have been some time ago . Maybe forty years ?
PIKE: Something like that , yes .
RAY: She give you that scar , too ?
PIKE: I oughta shoot you for that comment , oy .
RAY: Like you shot Winston Hancock ?
WILKINS: What 's going on here ?
PIKE: I 'm afraid I 'm gon na have to teach this uppity nigger a lesson in manners .
RAY: That 's Mr. Uppity Nigger to you .
CLAUDE: Cool it , Ray . You 're gon na get us in a lot of trouble .
WILKINS: He 's right , Gibson . Put down the gun and we 'll work this out .
RAY: I 'm gon na work this man 's brains out the back of his head .
PIKE: Shoot him , Wilkins !
CLAUDE: Do n't shoot , sir . I can deal with this . Ray , buddy , you do n't want to shoot this white man . See , you do that , they 'll kill you for sure . And it 's not that I like you or anything , but I 've kinda gotten used to having you around .
RAY: He 's got my daddy 's watch , Claude . I always knew whoever took that watch killed Winston Hancock . And that was you , Mr. Pike .
PIKE: He 's crazy . Do n't listen to him , Wilkins .
WILKINS: Do you realize what your saying , Gibson ?
RAY: That watch was the only thing my daddy ever gave me . It meant the world to me .
PIKE: Goddamn it , Wilkins , would you please just shoot the nigger !
RAY: He shoots me , I swear I 'll take you with me ! I just want to hear you say it .
WILKINS: Is there any truth to what he 's saying , Pike ?
PIKE: What difference does it make ? Natchez was better off without Winston Hancock ! Who cares if a couple of no- account bootleggers went to jail fo his killing ? At least the state of Mississippi got 40 years of cheap labor out of the deal !
CLAUDE: Forty years of cheap labor ! Gim me that gun . Claude grabs for the gun .
RAY: No , I 'm gon na kill him
CLAUDE: No , believe me , I 'm gon na kill him !
RAY: That 's because you 're soft . Gim me the gun .
CLAUDE: What 'd you say ?
RAY: I said you 're soft .
CLAUDE: Do n't call me soft , I hate it when you call me that .
RAY: I believe this is mine .
WILKINS: I was drawing a bead on a bird when Mr. Pike just stepped into my line of fire .
DEPUTY #1: Where were the two convicts when the shot was fired ?
WILKINS: They were busy loading up the truck . We got him back here as quick as possible , but I just feel terrible about this
CLAUDE: Why do n't he just tell 'em the truth ?
RAY: He knows nobody wants to hear the truth .
WILKINS: Well , I think they bought it . One of the deputies belongs to my church .
CLAUDE: Sure , boss .
WILKINS: I 'm not your boss . Not anymore .
JAKE: So Ray and Claude got their pardons , ight ?
LEON: No , they did n't get their pardons , you dumb shit ! If they 'd got thei pardons way back then , we would n't e burying them today , would we ?
JAKE: Oh , right . Well , why did n't they get those pardons ?
WILLIE: Old man Wilkins ' never came out of that bathroom . Died right there on the crapper .
LEON: Just like Elvis .
WILLIE: Of course nobody believed Ray and Claude .
JAKE: That musta messed 'em up pretty bad .
LEON: What happened to 'em after that , Willie ?
WILLIE: After that ? Well , let 's see . Afte that they got old . We all got old .
RAY: Nurse Humphries was checking my prostate this morning . I got an erection .
CLAUDE: An erection , huh ? Have n't had one of those in a while .
RAY: Tell me about it . Scared me at first . Then , before I could figure out what to do with it , it was gone . Imagine my disappointment .
CLAUDE: Sure would like to see the house that Ruth built one more time .
RAY: Well , Ruth shoulda built it a little etter . Damn thing 's falling to pieces . Gon na hurt somebody .
CLAUDE: What do you expect ? It 's almost as old as we are .
RAY: They oughta tear that shit down and ship them Yankees cross the river to Jersey .
CLAUDE: Remember what that place looked like on a sunny spring day ? More beautiful than any church I was ever in .
RAY: Over to the morgue and up the hill to the cemetery . Never thought I 'd admit it , Claude , but you were right .
CLAUDE: 'Course I was right . About what ?
RAY: You 're the one who said that oneyard 's the only way we 're getting out of here . We 're gon na join all the rest of 'em soon enough . Jangle Leg , Biscuit , Goldmouth , Poker Face , Cookie , Radio yes sir , pick a plot and start digging
CLAUDE: I 'll raise you .
RAY: I would n't be putting that shit up my nose . That came in in somebody 's ass . It 's like you 're sniffin ' ass . Maybe that 's your thing , but it ai n't mine .
WILLIE: Looks like it 's up to you , stinky ass sniffer .
CLAUDE: Thorazine ? Well , that 's a little ich for my blood .
RAY: I got three stool softeners left . That oughta be right up your alley .
NURSE HUMPHRIES: Who wants Jell-O ?
RAY: Hey , where you going ? We got money on the table here !
CLAUDE: You know , Ray , I 've been chewing on what you said this afternoon . I think I got a plan . Ray gives Claude a long look .
RAY: Are you trying to tell me after all this time you finally have a plan for busting out of here ?
CLAUDE: Shh ! Is that so hard to believe ?
RAY: Do n't tell me , I do n't want to hea it . It 's probably all fucked up , anyway .
CLAUDE: You do n't want to hear it , you do n't want to hear it . There 's no shame in that .
RAY: It 's too late for plans .
CLAUDE: Never thought I 'd hear Ray Gibson say that . Hell with you then . You 'd only slow me down anyway .
RAY: Hey , man , cover that shit up !
NURSE HUMPHRIES: Is everyone here ?
RAY: Hey , where 's Claude ? I do n't see Claude !
NURSE HUMPHRIES: Stay calm , Ray . We 'll find him . Claude ! Has anyone seen Claude ?
RAY: He must still be in there .
NURSE HUMPHRIES: Wait for the firemen !
RAY: It 'll be too late .
NURSE HUMPHRIES: You ca n't go in there , Ray ! You 'll never make it !
RAY: I 'm going in for him . He 'd do the same for me .
BURKE: How did it start ?
FIRE INSPECTOR: Probably old wires . The place was a tinderbox just waiting to go .
BURKE: I guess we should have torn this old uilding down a long time ago .
FIRE INSPECTOR: Gibson made it this far before he was probably overcome by smoke . From the look of things , Banks never even made it out of bed .
LEON: Man , you really bummed me out . That 's a terrible story . Nigger , you crying ?
JAKE: Hell , no ! I just got something in my eye .
WILLIE: It 's alright for a man to cry once in awhile . Just do n't make a habit of it .
LEON: Hey , Willie , what was Claude 's plan , anyway ?
WILLIE: Nothing to it , really . Claude figured they could steal a couple of bodies from the morgue . They got a couple of crackers working there do n't know their asses from their elbows . Then they was gon na set fire to the infirmary and make it look like those odies was them that got stuck inside . Claude figured during the commotion , it would n't be too hard to slip onto one of the fire trucks and hang tight until it rolled right on out of here in the morning .
JAKE: What makes you think it did n't work ?
WILLIE: I never said it did n't work .
LEON: You trying to tell us that 's not Ray and Claude in those boxes ?
JAKE: What do you think about that ?
LEON: I think that old man lost his marbles about a hundred years ago . Come on , let 's get this over with .
FIREMAN #1: Alright , which of you hambones took our clothes ?
CLAUDE: I ca n't eat this .
RAY: Why the hell not ?
CLAUDE: I saw that hot dog guy in the bathroom urinating . He did n't wash his hands .
RAY: Just put some mustard on it and eat it .
CLAUDE: You did n't get ketchup ?
RAY: Gim me that damn thing . Ray snatches back the hot dog .
CLAUDE: What am I gon na eat ? Ray is suddenly young again .
RAY: Have my ice cream .
CLAUDE: Thanks . They look at each other and share a laugh .
RAY: Hell of a day for a ballgame , huh , Claude ?
CLAUDE: Hell of a day , Ray . Yankees are on fire .
RAY: So ?
CLAUDE: They 're touching . The CAMERA begins to pull back .
RAY: If you do n't eat that ice cream right now , I 'm gon na strangle you until you are completely dead .
CLAUDE: Yeah ? You and what army ?
RAY: Next thing , you 're gon na be complaining about the seats .
CLAUDE: Well , if you must know , they could e closer .
RAY: Damn , I shoulda let Spanky Johnson drown you in the river when I had the chance .
CLAUDE: I know you 're not talking to me
RAY: I 'm sorry , he 's on medication
COLLEEN: This is ridiculous !
ROBIN: Run downstairs and give your dad a hug .
RYAN: Why ?
ROBIN: He 'll be gone for his birthday .
ADAM: Can we have a party for him while he 's gone ? Robin stops and KNOCKS on a bedroom door .
ROBIN: I hope you 're showered and ready fo school !
GEORGE: Stick it up your ass ! Have a nice day . Guster !
COLLEEN: This has got to stop !
GEORGE: He escaped . He 's going back in .
COLLEEN: Does it give you some sort of perverse pleasure to expose yourpenis in plain view of my sixteen year-old daughter ?
GEORGE: There are no windows facing myexposure .
COLLEEN: George , this is the third time .
GEORGE: The plumber 's due out on Friday .
COLLEEN: You 'll have to explain that to the police .
GEORGE: You were the only neighbor I could tolerate .
COLLEEN: I did warn you .
GEORGE: My life is a warning . I just ca n't figure out for what .
ADAM: Sam broke his closet . Peter glances at Robin , who shrugs .
ROBIN: I do n't have a clue anymore . I wish you 'd talk to him . He needs a man .
PETER: His father is a man .
ROBIN: A man he respects .
SAM: Thanks for talking about me behind my ackuseful in court .
PETER: Are you wearing eye shadow ?
SAM: No .
PETER: Take it off .
SAM: If I walk out the door , who 's gon na be here tonight for the follow through ? Peter hesitates for just a second .
RYAN: Queer .
ROBIN: What did you say ?
RYAN: Dad said it first .
ADAM: I get chocolate cake for your birthday .
PETER: Are your hands clean ?
MAREK: Dude , nice look .
ALYSSA: I saw your dad this morning .
JOSH: Been thinking ?
SAM: No .
MAREK: Forget him !
JOSH: Two hours a week for three-hundred cash . The whole summer . Do the math . They consider that a hatchback or a station wagon ? Oh , that is n't yours anyway , is it ?
COREY: I was in total REM , man !
STEVEN: Doneclose to done ?
GEORGE: I 'm doing the grass .
STEVEN: Fuck the grass . Who said grass ?
GEORGE: I was going to start Monday .
STEVEN: He likes the look of the computer models , anyway . You take too long . After you mow the grass , would you mind inging the house to my office ? I have a presentation to make .
FRIEND: I would n't make a habit of it .
ALYSSA: Okay .
GEORGE: You 'll crap real logs if you keep eating wood .
ALYSSA: Does Sam have any friends ?
GEORGE: He must .
ALYSSA: He seems lonely .
GEORGE: Are you his friend ?
ALYSSA: No .
GEORGE: Why ?
ALYSSA: Marilyn Mansonand I guess he 's into guys . I hate nose rings . And the blue eye shadow thing really is n't working .
KURT: Thought I 'd run over the list .
ALYSSA: This is such a street of whiners .
KURT: From Tuesday to yesterday , not including Monday or today . OkayMrs . Dokos is epeatedly running over her lawn . The Corliss ' have attributed the increase in at population in their environs to the state of yourstructure .
ALYSSA: IPO 's caused the rat population on this street . Officer Walker focuses on Alyssa .
KURT: And of course the Beck 's , with the
ALYSSA: It could have been a squirt gun .
KURT: You 've been good this week .
GEORGE: You forgot David Dokos and Tom and Barbara . Kurt stuffs his pad back into his pocket .
KURT: Mr. Dokos calls animal control for Guste and I was out here on the other . Do you mind ?
ALYSSA: Are you guys ' friends ?
KURT: We 've known each other since grade school .
ALYSSA: I mean , but did you both go camping on weekends ? Listen to music ? Masturbate together ? Talk on the phone ? George does n't answer and Kurt keeps working .
KURT: Hunted rabbit in the hills . Alyssa stares at George , disappointed .
GEORGE: I aimed high .
KURT: We just were n't very much alike , I guess . I do n't know . I liked your dad more than I liked you .
ALYSSA: I would n't want you as a friend .
KURT: George just never reallyaimed that high . Even with not hitting a rabbit . I knew you were doing that , by the way . That 's why I stopped doing it with you . You were no fun . It was always like you were frightened . Quiet and boring .
ALYSSA: Funny how he 's the architect and you 're just a loud mouth cop .
KURT: He builds models for architects . His dad , on the other hand , was the real deal . Designed and built the coolest houses I 've ever seen .
GEORGE: Was bankrupt and dead before I was twenty .
KURT: Left you this place .
GEORGE: It was in my name so he would n't lose it . He stole it from everyone that deserved it by putting me on title .
KURT: Do you know what I 'd give to have this ! Forget how I got it ! I ca n't afford dirt in this town . I live in Riverside , Goddammitt And you get to piss in the ocean . Kurt stops working and steps back .
GEORGE: Thanks for telling me .
KURT: At least your father tried , George .
ROBIN: Then why do you stay you ?
GEORGE: You should lock your doors .
ROBIN: Ring the bell before you try the door .
GEORGE: You let him pierce his nose ?
ROBIN: Lock the door behind you .
GEORGE: Where is he ?
ROBIN: Where he always is .
GEORGE: Not that I do n't trust you .
ROBIN: What kind of a mother ca n't stand he son ? George jerks his arm away from her grip .
GEORGE: I do n't know .
ADAM: Marco !
RYAN: What are you doing ?
ADAM: I 'm not cheating ! I 'm not looking !
ROBIN: What are you doing ?
GEORGE: He does n't answer .
ROBIN: He never answers .
GEORGE: Why does he have a lock on his door ?
ROBIN: Because he put the lock on ! Do you think I told him he could have a nose ring ? ! Why do you ask me everything you should ask him ! ? I do n't know anything , anymore !
GEORGE: You need every brain cell you 've got .
SAM: Leave me alone !
ROBIN: I do n't know what to do , anymore . Take him . You take him . You 're such a good father .
SAM: What are you doing in my room ?
ROBIN: I did n't go in your room .
SAM: I locked the door ! Get out ! I locked the door ! Get out !
SECRETARY: Good morning .
GEORGE: Is there a
BRYAN: George , have a seat ! I 've got juice .
GEORGE: A bird caught me .
BRYAN: Orange juicecroissant ? Bryan motions with his hand as he sits .
GEORGE: I 'm good , thanks .
BRYAN: What are you on ?
GEORGE: Pardon me ?
BRYAN: how much weight have you lost ?
GEORGE: Ohnothing . Thirty pounds . I just have n't been very hungry .
BRYAN: How 's your wife ?
GEORGE: When we divorce a decade ago , she was very , very angry . Now she 's just hostile .
BRYAN: Rightshe marriedwhat was he ?
GEORGE: He buys and sells the world .
BRYAN: Peter Webber ! Right . Quite the spotlight on that guy .
GEORGE: I did tell you , did n't I ? That I 'd be eady to start the Berlin model today ?
BRYAN: Well , that 's sort ofyou 're sure you 're not hungry ?
GEORGE: Typing and clicking myself to renderings is n't why I started building models .
BRYAN: All of us are typing and clicking , George . Whether we want to , or not .
GEORGE: I 'm not .
BRYAN: Which is why we bid out a quarter of ou projects . It does n't make a lot of sense anymore to want what we do n't have and do n't want what we do .
GEORGE: I 've been here twenty years .
BRYAN: Maybe that 's too long .
GEORGE: Maybe ?
BRYAN: That 's too long . George nods as he stares at Bryan .
GEORGE: My wife left me because I wasn'tvery emotional . I kept trying to explain that my father sucked all the emotion from me . Drunks do that , sometimes . Make thei kids afraid . Make them unwilling to express themselves .
BRYAN: Oh .
GEORGE: How old are you ?
BRYAN: Forty .
GEORGE: We were probably in school together . You went to Berkley ?
BRYAN: Class of eighty-six ! I did n't know you were there .
GEORGE: I was a sophomore when I got the call my parents were dead .
BRYAN: Listenmaybe I can get you a year .
GEORGE: I hate this job .
BRYAN: What are you talking about ? You love your job .
GEORGE: From the day I startedto today . Ca n't stand it . Bryan is perplexed as George stands .
BRYAN: Then it sounds like I 'm doing you a favor .
GEORGE: It may sound that way , but I react out of fear . My life has nothing to do with what I like or do n't like . You have n't een listening , have you ?
BRYAN: I did n't know there would be a quiz , George .
GEORGE: For everything .
BRYAN: Well , I feel better about this now .
GEORGE: Good . I was hoping for that .
BRYAN: What can I do for you , George ?
GEORGE: I built my first model here when I was twenty . There are hundreds of them on shelves around the office . Twenty years of my life . I was wondering if I might e able to pick a few to keep , to take home ? Only the ones that really mean something to me . Bryan recoils slightly from the request .
BRYAN: Oh , wellthose areI mean , we do n't get to keep our work . I could maybe ask them if you could choose one . But , you know , frankly George , you were the best . Computer models ca n't begin to match the eauty you gave yours . They 're a part of this firm . They inspire me . I go out there and sometimes just stare at something I 've designed . It amazes me . I would miss that too much . Look , I may be going out on a limb , but you go out there and look them over , every single one of them and pick the one you like the best and take it with you . Just run it by me first , just in case , you knowbut I 'm sure it 'll be okay .
GEORGE: Thank you .
BRYAN: Well , it 's the least I can do .
GEORGE: Yes , it is .
STEVEN: Mother of God ! Not my house !
VOICE: Oh , please , please , no !
SECRETARY: UhMr . Burke would like a word with you , George . George lowers his stick as he faces her .
GEORGE: Ohokay .
SECRETARY: In his office . When you 're able .
GEORGE: Thank you .
BRYAN: Thank you .
GEORGE: You 're right . You win .
NURSE: I 'd eat a lot of red meat .
GEORGE: Good for you .
NURSE: What would you do ?
GEORGE: I 'd build a house . George takes another spoonful of food .
NURSE: What kind of house ?
GEORGE: You know what mortise and tenon is ? The nurse shakes her head `` no '' .
NURSE: No one 's really said four months is all you have , have they ?
GEORGE: Stage four pancreatic cancer . They have n't even pretended to offe treatment . You tell me , when would you start eating red meat ?
NURSE: Can you build a house in four months ?
GEORGE: I can die trying .
NURSE: Good for you .
GEORGE: I have n't been touched in years .
NURSE: I 'm sorry , I do n't know what that was .
GEORGE: A handshake , or you know , someone pats you on your back through clothes . Doctors , people who have to touch you . But not by people who want to .
NURSE: No . A friend your mother ? Everybody gets touched by someone they love .
GEORGE: Is n't that weird ? I mean , I dated a little bit after my divorce , for four o five years . Six years . I know when my son was youngermaybe when he was ten or eleven even , he 'd run up and wrap his arms around me .
NURSE: Oh God , I 'm married .
PATIENT: I 'm hungry .
GEORGE: I 'm touched .
ROBIN: I called everyone , everywhere ! You just vanished ! You could be dead !
GEORGE: Thanks for waking me up . Picking me up . You 're loud today .
ROBIN: You 're inconsiderate and absolutely devoid of emotion !
GEORGE: You 're the most beautiful woman I have ever known in my life .
ROBIN: What ?
GEORGE: I 'm not talking just physically . Even your anger is perfect .
ROBIN: You did n't think someone from your office would call and tell me you wrecked the entire building and threatened people with a baseball bat ? !
GEORGE: A blueprint spool .
ROBIN: Where have you been for a week ? !
GEORGE: Four days . I left to think .
ROBIN: What did you do with your dog ?
GEORGE: Kurt 's been feeding him .
ROBIN: But you ca n't call me while you think ?
GEORGE: I was n't thinking . Look , I 'm sorry I did n't think to call you while I thoughtI think .
ROBIN: Why would they tow your truck ?
GEORGE: I was parked in day parking .
ROBIN: Why call me ?
GEORGE: I 'm going to tear down the shack and uild my house .
ROBIN: You 've been saying that for twenty years . While we were dating , you said it .
GEORGE: There 's nothing anymore to stop me .
ROBIN: Money ?
GEORGE: Severance pay . And I 'm going to cash in my life insurance policy .
ROBIN: How many years did I live with your beams and boards ? First in the garage , then in the living room . We 're going to do it , Robin . Next year . Next year . Salvaged floorboards from a house in Pasadena . Doors from a church in New Hampshire
GEORGE: I love those doors .
ROBIN: Where will you live ?
GEORGE: The garage .
ROBIN: Look , I was n't serious about you taking Sam , so you do n't have to get into any actual construction to get out of it .
GEORGE: When 's school over ?
ROBIN: FridayGod , I hate the thought of him home all day .
GEORGE: I 'll be by Saturday to pick him up .
ROBIN: He does n't want to spend the weekends with you anymore .
GEORGE: Not for the weekend . For the summer . Robin scoffs .
ROBIN: You and Sam are going to live in a garage without plumbing for the summer ?
GEORGE: The garage is plumbed . I 'll put in a toilet . We 'll survive .
ROBIN: Thank you for at least sounding sincere .
GEORGE: Sounding ? I need help . He 's cheap labor .
ROBIN: One of you would end up dead .
GEORGE: At least we 'll have a house to show fo it .
ROBIN: Forget it , really . I 'll survive .
GEORGE: I want him with me .
ROBIN: No , you do n't . Trust me . George rests a hand on the back of her neck .
GEORGE: I want Sam for the summer .
ROBIN: Okay .
GEORGE: Hey , hey !
ROBIN: I 'm married . George nods as he mock nurses his finger .
COREY: The whole summer , man . Party in Tahoe .
SAM: I do n't know .
COREY: It 'll just be my brother the dweeb on weekends . All we got ta do is sand and paint the cabin , dude . My dad 's gon na let me use the boat and my charm is gon na let me use my rod . Income village is the place to hook up with hump .
SAM: I 'll ask .
COREY: Hey , it beats letting town folk go down on you for the summer .
SAM: I never said anything . I have n't done anything .
COREY: I know what the deal is . Josh is a pimp . I 'm not stupid .
SAM: You do n't know what the deal is . There is no fucking deal .
ALYSSA: Hi , Mr. Nelson .
GEORGE: Alyssa .
ALYSSA: Why have you put a toilet and a bed in your garage ?
GEORGE: I 'm living here while I build anothe house .
ALYSSA: Is that legal ?
GEORGE: Do n't you have school ?
ALYSSA: Nope .
GEORGE: What 's today ?
ALYSSA: Monday .
GEORGE: My keys .
ALYSSA: What 's that ?
GEORGE: Nothing . I cut myself . George pats down his pockets .
ALYSSA: I 'm not shaving my legs or pits this summer , I 've decided .
GEORGE: Make the bed for me , would you ? I got ta un .
COLLEEN: And you thought they might be under he dress ?
ALYSSA: I was just showing him my hair . Alyssa miffed as she stands .
GEORGE: Her leg hair . Colleen turns and walks out .
LOIS: Mrs. Webber is in the backyard .
GEORGE: And Sam ?
LOIS: In his room , packing .
GEORGE: OhGood .
SAM: I heard you already !
GEORGE: Your mom and the boys can drop by anytime .
SAM: To check up on me ?
GEORGE: I 'll be around to check up on you .
SAM: Why would you be there ?
GEORGE: Because I live there .
SAM: You live in Cory 's parents ' cabin ?
GEORGE: Did you tell him he 's spending the summe with me ?
ROBIN: What was I supposed to do ? When you did n't show up Saturday , I tried to call . Your phone is n't working .
GEORGE: I do n't have a phone .
ROBIN: I drove over and you were gone .
GEORGE: I ca n't leave the house ?
ROBIN: Last time you were gone for a week !
GEORGE: Did you tell him he was spending the summer with me ?
ROBIN: No . I was going to let you do that .
GEORGE: He 's not spending the summer in Tahoe .
SAM: Who are you , anyway ? I do n't even know you .
GEORGE: You 'll know me by the time we 're through .
SAM: I 'm not going !
GEORGE: I 'll get your bag .
SAM: Mom , tell him I 'm not going . You already promised me !
GEORGE: You have everything ?
ROBIN: I did say he could go .
GEORGE: Let 's go .
SAM: I 'm not going !
GEORGE: You do n't have a choice .
SAM: Momplease .
ROBIN: George
GEORGE: He 's not spending the entire summer with another kid in Tahoe . If he leaves , I will follow him up there and I will drag him home by his nose ring . He can hate me . You can hate me . He can try to kill me while I sleep . You can call the police . You can call your husband o your attorney , but Sam is spending the summer with me . He 's my son . He 's sixteen . That 's it .
ADAM: Can we hate you ?
GEORGE: You can do anything you want . George walks to Sam and touches his arm .
SAM: Go fuck yourself !
GEORGE: Your nose ring comes out of your nose . If you 've got them in your nipples , they come out , too . And there 's no make-up at my house . No glue sniffing . Huffing . No pills , no grass .
SAM: If you hit me , I 'll call the police .
GEORGE: You 've worn out your welcome at this house , Sam . I wo n't ever hit you . This may well be the worst three months of your life , but you 've earned it . So , pick up your suitcase and go get in the truck . Now .
SAM: I 'll hate you forever .
GEORGE: You ca n't even begins to know how much I hate my father . Think of it as a family tradition .
GEORGE: Do you want garlic bread ? !
SAM: Well , get over here , then , stupid .
GEORGE: Thinking of jumping ?
SAM: Pushing . George walks to the edge of the cliff .
GEORGE: Only jump after you hear the wave crash against the rock . The water will take you out . Let it . Swim a little North and you 'll see the sand .
SAM: Oh , shit !
GEORGE: I almost saw Catalina .
SAM: Guster !
ALYSSA: What are you doing here ?
SAM: They 're trying to make me spend the summer here . I 'm leaving in the morning .
ALYSSA: Where to ?
SAM: I 'm supposed to be in Tahoe .
ALYSSA: Your dad 's really gon na build his house ?
SAM: I do n't know .
ALYSSA: Well , if you do n't go , I guess I 'll see you .
SAM: I do n't know .
ALYSSA: Where 's your dad ?
SAM: He jumped into the ocean .
ALYSSA: Tell him I said `` hi '' .
SAM: I 'm not taking a dump with you in here . George nods as he continues brushing .
GEORGE: Which side of the bed do you want ?
SAM: Probably in the bible .
GEORGE: Goodnight .
SAM: I have to take a dump .
GEORGE: Have you got sunscreen on ?
BARBARA: It 's about time this shack is torn down .
TOM: Oh , hello George .
GEORGE: Guess how many low-income apartments the city approved for this lot ? Tom and Barbara react by trying not to react .
SAM: What are you doing ? !
GEORGE: I warned you yesterday .
SAM: Do n't touch me ! You ca n't touch me !
GEORGE: Rub him down , please .
SAM: He 's a freak .
ALYSSA: You look better without make-up .
SAM: I ca n't even take a shower here .
ALYSSA: Come over to my house whenever you want . I 'll tell my mom .
SAM: I might not stay , anyway .
ALYSSA: I 'll get your back .
SAM: No . That 's okay .
ALYSSA: Have you ever had anyone but your mom o dad put it on for you ?
SAM: Yeah .
ALYSSA: Your dad dated my mom after her divorce .
SAM: Really ?
ALYSSA: I wanted him to marry her .
SAM: Why ?
ALYSSA: Turn over .
SAM: No thanks .
ALYSSA: Do n't forget your front .
GEORGE: She 's prettyfor a girl .
SAM: No .
GEORGE: Get the inkling , Sam . I 'm getting tired of your attitude .
SAM: I hate turkey .
GEORGE: No you do n't .
SAM: Why ?
GEORGE: It bugs me .
SAM: You snore at night . That bugs me . Can I take you out ?
GEORGE: Your brothers are right . It was the most god-awful smell I 've ever had my nose around .
ROBIN: Thought you guys might be hungry .
GEORGE: We 're fine . Turkey sandwiches .
ROBIN: Well , for later then .
GEORGE: What ?
ROBIN: I used to live here .
GEORGE: But you hated four out of the five you did .
ROBIN: I was here six years . And I only hated two .
GEORGE: Which ?
ROBIN: The first and the last . George sets his sandwich down .
GEORGE: I do n't even like turkey sandwiches . What kind of pizza ?
ROBIN: Sam 's favorite .
GEORGE: Why the first and the last ?
ROBIN: The first because I was n't sure you eally loved methe last because I was n't sure I really loved you .
GEORGE: I was up on the roof this morning , tearing it down and it struck me as strong as anything ever has . That I 'm happy today .
ROBIN: What have you been before today ?
GEORGE: It was just that , maybe the way the sun struck the ocean , the sound of the waves . It was simple , whatever it was . Then I started thinking about the last time I felt this good . It 's been a long time .
ROBIN: Do you remember ?
GEORGE: The only time I can think of for sure , I was holding onto Sam in the ocean , saving him from the waves .
ROBIN: We have it on video ! Was that when ? My parents were down for his sixth birthday ! I remember that .
SAM: I have to go . She stands and backs away from the table .
GEORGE: What is it ?
ROBIN: I 'm fine . Nothing . I 'll drop by your lunch tomorrow .
GEORGE: I do n't know .
SAM: I 'm gon na take a walk . I need some money .
GEORGE: You 'll have money when you work .
SAM: You 're so predictable .
GEORGE: I 'd blame you . I want you here .
SAM: I 'm not doing it !
GEORGE: It 'll be fine .
SAM: Why do n't you just beg some money off my dad and move into something decent with a eal kitchen and a real bathroom ?
GEORGE: I 'd rather sell my nuts to a castrati . Sam screws his face down - huh ?
SAM: And I do n't take a shower in the middle of the yard .
GEORGE: I can promise you complete privacy .
SAM: You ca n't promise me anything ! You do n't have anything to promise ! You live in a garage ! You do n't have cable ! You 're not hooked up to the internet because you do n't even own a computer ! You do n't have a job !
GEORGE: This will save you from prying eyes .
SAM: If you had a stupid phone or I could use your truck , mom would give me some money .
GEORGE: You 'll have money when you work for it .
SAM: Is Alyssa home ?
COLLEEN: She 's out with a friend .
SAM: Ohdo you know when she 'll be home ?
COLLEEN: She did n't really say .
SAM: Ohokay .
COLLEEN: Sam ?
SAM: Uh huh .
COLLEEN: I did n't recognize you !
SAM: I 'm sorry .
COLLEEN: Alyssa said you do n't even have plumbing over there .
SAM: Not a shower .
PETER: The goddamn traffic . Were we going out to dinner ?
ROBIN: We 've eaten .
PETER: Is Lois still here ? I 'm starved .
ROBIN: I 'll make you something .
PETER: Did someone call to tell you I 'd be late ?
SAM: I locked the door . Josh holds up a tiny screwdriver .
JOSH: It 'll take you like twenty , thirty minutes .
SAM: Does Alyssa know ?
JOSH: Nothing .
SAM: You got any weed ?
JOSH: You got the money ?
GEORGE: Ah ! Oh .
KURT: Mr. Dokos called to complain that you and a boy are squatting illegally in the garage of your house .
GEORGE: Check the permits . It was built as a guesthouse . It 's a legally rentable unit grandfathered when South Laguna was incorporated .
KURT: Now that should be illegal .
SAM: Thanks for the shower .
COLLEEN: I want you both to stay .
ALYSSA: And candy too .
JOSH: I 'm gon na give him a ride in my car .
ALYSSA: I 'll see you tomorrow .
COLLEEN: Come over anytime you need to , Sam .
SAM: Thanks , I 'd like that . Thank you .
KURT: I 'm surprised he has n't left .
GEORGE: I have n't forced him to work . I only wet him down once . Why would he leave ?
SAM: I 'm leaving .
GEORGE: Heyhey ! Sam stops at the door and waits impatiently .
SAM: I do n't know .
GEORGE: When are you going to be back ?
SAM: I do n't know .
GEORGE: Well , until you know , you ca n't go .
SAM: Oh , okay .
GEORGE: I 'm not very good at it . Parenting . Kurt nods ; agreed , he 's not .
PETER: I hope your ex-husband is equipped fo the havoc of Sam , because it seems absolutely blissful here tonight .
ROBIN: Do you think it 's odd your kids do n't hug you ?
PETER: Should I ?
ROBIN: It would worry me .
PETER: If I let everything that should worry me , worry me , I 'd be dead from worry .
ROBIN: What would you be if you asked Adam and Ryan to run in now and hug you ?
PETER: I 'd be you .
JOSH: You do n't have to do a thing . Just get in and get out . As quick as you can . Close your eyes and think of whatever . Sam hands the joint to Josh .
SAM: What 's your deal with Alyssa ?
JOSH: Do n't evenI 'm there .
SAM: I was n't sure .
JOSH: She would n't even fucking go out with until she was sixteen . I mean , that 's not even a rule , just her own thing . She like figures things out on her own and then that 's it .
SAM: I 'm thinking it 's too weird now .
JOSH: It beats working . Josh hands Sam the joint .
OFFICER: What did you toss into the brush ?
JOSH: Nothing .
OFFICER: Turn off the music !
JOSH: Oh , it 's working now .
OFFICER: What did you toss into the brush ?
ROBIN: Lunch .
GEORGE: It 's not breakfast yet .
ROBIN: I dreamed about your house last night .
GEORGE: Finished or unfinished ?
ROBIN: It was perfect , George . Amazing . It was so real .
GEORGE: Did n't you once dream you could lick people well , though ?
ROBIN: That was n't a dream . That was Sam .
GEORGE: Ohwith his ear infection !
ROBIN: My tongue around the edge of his ear is what cured him .
GEORGE: Go in there and lick his attitude .
ROBIN: The antibiotics were n't working . It 's what I believe , George .
GEORGE: You were wrong about the first year , you know ?
ROBIN: I 've been wrong a lot in my life .
GEORGE: Hindsight . It 's like foresight without a future .
ROBIN: I have three hours before I pick up Adam and Ryan . Where will I be most useful ?
GEORGE: With your hands or your tongue ?
ROBIN: You 're not well .
GEORGE: Good morning .
ROBIN: I 'm late .
BOB: Mr. Stevens ?
GEORGE: I 've been dreading you .
BOB: Bob Larson . Do you happen to have an unenclosed toilet in close proximity to a kitchen ?
GEORGE: A violation ?
BOB: Oh , yes .
GEORGE: And if I enclosed it ?
BOB: An exhaust system or a window is code .
GEORGE: A sink ?
BOB: Allowed outside the enclosed area .
SAM: Where is it ?
GEORGE: A friend of yours is here .
SAM: Did you got through my pants ?
GEORGE: I might have a solution .
SAM: Where 'd you put it ? !
GEORGE: Doors .
BOB: I hate to ask about a window .
GEORGE: I flushed it down the toilet .
SAM: No ! Oh my God !
BOB: I assume you 'll fill theuh , window , with glass ?
GEORGE: If that 's what it takes .
SAM: What 's in my pants is none of you fucking business !
BOB: I would say you 're in compliance .
GEORGE: I hope that makes the pain in the ass that called you happy .
BOB: You and me both .
GEORGE: Everything about you is my business . What you smoke , what you swallow , what you sniff , it 's all my business .
SAM: I 've been using since I was twelve ! You 're all so unbelievably stupid . You did n't give a shit about anything I did until now !
GEORGE: I 'll apologize for everything but todayToday I give a shit .
SAM: You 're too fucking late .
GEORGE: The gloves on the table are for you .
SAM: You ca n't make me do a thing .
GEORGE: Sit down for a second .
SAM: No .
GEORGE: My dad used to play a game . I neve eally understood what it was until afte he was gone . Sam appears immensely disinterested .
SAM: I was holding for someone . That was n't even mine .
GEORGE: The game was to make me smaller than he was . No matter what . He could be almost invisible as a human being , but I had to e smaller . So if I got good grades , I was a pussy for not playing football . If I cut my hair for him , it was n't short enough . If I shaved it , I looked like a psycho . I never won the game . Not once . And if he could n't make me smaller with words
SAM: I 'll have to pay him back .
GEORGE: I wo n't ever hit you . I do n't want you smaller . I want you to e happy . You 're not . Not here with me . Not home with your mother . Not up in Tahoe . Not alone . Not anywhere . You 're what I was most of my life , Sam . I see it in your eyes . In your sleep . In your answer to everything . You 're arely alive .
SAM: I 'm not even listening .
GEORGE: You know that great thing , though ? Is that change can be so constant you do n't even feel the difference until there is one . It can be so slow that you do n't even notice that your life is better o worse , until it is . Or it can just blow you away . Make you something different in an instant . It happened to me .
SAM: I have to pay back what you flushed down the toilet . I want ten dollars an hourthen I 'm done .
GEORGE: It all has to come down before we can start again . Knock it down .
SAM: Do n't . I do n't want it .
GEORGE: Do whatever you want with it . I do n't care . All I want from you is for you to emember we built this house together .
SAM: We have n't build shit . You 're just tearing down your father .
GEORGE: Try it . It feels good .
ROBIN: It 's morning , sleepyheads !
RYAN: Why do we have to get up and eat with you this early ?
ROBIN: I just thought it would be nice .
ADAM: Are you going to see Sam again ?
ROBIN: I thought I might stop by .
RYAN: All day again ?
ROBIN: Not all day . I 'll be home after lunch .
ADAM: I wan na be with you today .
ROBIN: Oh , honey . There 's not much to do there . I mean , it 's all work .
ADAM: We can work .
ROBIN: Ryan , would you rather swim or work ?
RYAN: Can we really help build a house ?
PETER: Why is everyone up so early ?
COLLEEN: If she 's not up , you can use my shower .
SAM: Thank you .
COLLEEN: You 're here early today .
SAM: We 're getting out of the ground today .
ALYSSA: Were you with Josh when the cops arrested him ?
SAM: Not really . No . Kinda . He got busted ?
ALYSSA: His parents took his car . They 're making him ride a bicycle the rest of the summer . Sam ca n't help but like that .
SAM: Really ?
ALYSSA: He asked me to tell you that you owe him a hundred dollars .
SAM: He can peddle over anytime he wants to for it . Sam breaks into a full-on smile .
ALYSSA: This is serious ! I do n't have my license . He was my ride .
SAM: I 'm sorry . I 'm just here to shower .
ALYSSA: I 've seen lots of people . It 's not a big thing for me .
SAM: Hand me a towel . I 'm getting out .
ALYSSA: I 'm coming in .
SAM: I do n't want you to !
ALYSSA: We 're not gon na do anything .
SAM: Why are you so stupid ?
ALYSSA: Why are you so uptight ?
SAM: I do n't evenwhat do you mean ? I do n't even know what that means .
ALYSSA: It means I 'm gon na shampoo my hair and stay out of your way .
SAM: Hand me a towel . Hand me a towel .
ROBIN: I thought you 'd be up with the sun .
GEORGE: My stupid back .
ROBIN: Do you need anything ? I 'll go to the pharmacy . I have some Demerol at home .
GEORGE: No , I'mthanks . I took something . Robin runs her hand down George 's spine .
ROBIN: Where 's Sam ?
GEORGE: He wo n't use my shower . I do n't get it .
ROBIN: I kind of said that maybe they could do something . Help . I 'm sorry . They eally wanted to come . I really wanted to come and they wanted to be with me . I do n't think they 'll be too much trouble .
GEORGE: I 'll find something that wo n't kill them .
ROBIN: Or wound . Let them keep their eyes and fingers .
GEORGE: You 're a good mother .
ROBIN: Do you need help ?
GEORGE: I think so .
ROBIN: I woke up this morning at three and could n't fall back asleep . Everyday I think I see more of Sam than I 've seen in years .
SAM: Hey .
ADAM: Mom said I should .
SAM: Oh .
ADAM: I would have anyway .
ALYSSA: Who are you ?
ADAM: I 'm his brother .
ALYSSA: I 'm his friend .
ADAM: Mom says we can build a house .
ALYSSA: Hi , Mr. Nelson .
GEORGE: Hi , Alyssa .
SAM: Hi , Mom .
ROBIN: Good morning .
ALYSSA: Hello .
ROBIN: You 're so nice to let Sam use you shower .
ALYSSA: He 's got a standing invitation . Sam instantly flushes red .
SAM: Hey , Ryan .
RYAN: Hey .
SAM: So , you wan na build a house ?
RYAN: If we do , will it stay up ?
ROBIN: I brought a few of my own .
RYAN: Someone stop her !
GEORGE: It 's been a while .
ROBIN: This was my very first slow dance .
ADAM: Did you know him before you knew Dad ?
ROBIN: Since seventh grade .
GEORGE: Tell him how you made me fall in love with you .
ROBIN: I smiled at him .
GEORGE: Watch out for the smile , boys .
ROBIN: Who 's up for a dance ?
GEORGE: Oh , I 'm worse . Much , much worse .
ALYSSA: I 'll see you tomorrow .
RYAN: When did you fall in love with my dad ?
ROBIN: When I found out I was pregnant with you .
SAM: I took some of your Vicodin .
GEORGE: I know . Why ?
SAM: I like how it feels not to feel . George turns onto his side to face his son .
GEORGE: I know the feeling .
SAM: How do you become something you 're not ?
GEORGE: What would you like to be ?
SAM: What I 'm not .
GEORGE: What are you now ?
SAM: Nothing .
GEORGE: That 's not true .
SAM: See , that 's the thingI am what I say I am .
GEORGE: I know parts of who you are .
SAM: What do you know about me ?
GEORGE: When you started first grade and your mom went to work , it was so she could save for an apartment . But then she met Pete and skipped the idea of renting .
SAM: He 's got nothing to do with me .
GEORGE: I could n't imagine how I could compete with him for any part of you . So , I did n't . He wanted you to have his last nameI let him even take that .
SAM: He was a prick when I was six , and he 's a prick today . George turns onto his side to face Sam again .
GEORGE: I wish you had told me then .
SAM: I 'm telling you now .
GEORGE: I gave up on you .
SAM: I 'd be in Tahoe having fun if you had given up .
GEORGE: What would you be doing now ?
SAM: Getting high , I guess .
GEORGE: If I asked you to stop , would you ?
SAM: I have n't used anything for two days . I 'm trying .
GEORGE: I 'm proud of you , Sam .
SAM: Do n't be . And hide whatever that new drug is you have . I like it .
GEORGE: I put a gun to my father 's head once .
SAM: Are you talking ?
GEORGE: I was just thinking about my mom . She would n't leave him . I remember one time she made us dinner wearing sunglasses . I mean it was dark outside and in . But we never talked about it .
SAM: Sun glasses ?
GEORGE: To hide a black eye .
SAM: Why would n't she leave ?
GEORGE: I think she was terrified of living with himbut maybe even more terrified of life without him .
SAM: I would have killed him .
GEORGE: Everything would have been better if you had . You 'd have liked your grandmother . And there 'd be a girl out there that 'd have her mother . I remember reading about her in the paper . They could n't find her father and her mother was dead . I still feel guilty about that .
SAM: Do you ever wish you had done it ? George thinks about that for a second .
GEORGE: I loved him too much .
SAM: After everything he did to you and you mom ?
GEORGE: After everything .
SAM: That 's so weird
COLLEEN: Is anyone hungry ?
ADAM: I like the color I 'm making the doors .
GEORGE: The absolute best color I 've ever seen in my life . Adam lights up , pleased to be praised .
RYAN: How many bedrooms will your house have ?
GEORGE: Three .
ADAM: Will Sam live with you or us ?
GEORGE: With you .
SAM: So put your plans of my room in the trash .
ADAM: I do n't think Dad wants you home .
ROBIN: Adam , that 's not true !
RYAN: Yes , it is .
ROBIN: Would you stop being ridiculous ? You father wants Sam home as much as I do .
GEORGE: I love you !
PETER: You know what I 've decided ?
ROBIN: To shave your chest ?
PETER: We should take a vacation .
ROBIN: The biggest waste of time since television .
PETER: Do you remember anything I 've said that was n't negative ?
ROBIN: I 'd love to drive through New England in the Fall .
PETER: Sooner than the Fall . He closes in on her , kisses her cheek .
ROBIN: After the kids are back in school .
PETER: Lois will stay with them . Or we can pawn them off on your parents .
ROBIN: I 'm helping George build his house .
PETER: What ?
ROBIN: I 've been helping for the last few days . Weeks . Sam 's working . I told you Sam was working . I mean , he really is .
PETER: Good . That was the plan . We could n't stand him and George needed help . As true as it is , this still irritates Robin .
ROBIN: I ca n't go right now .
PETER: You ca n't go because of Sam ?
ROBIN: We have n't been away together for three years . What difference does a few months make ?
PETER: You ca n't go with me because of Sam ?
ROBIN: Sam is working at something for the first time in his life . Once in a while he even talks to me . I want to be around for that .
PETER: So am I , Robin . I 'm working at something , too . I 'm even talking . Do you want to be around for it ?
ROBIN: I do n't know .
PETER: I was talking about our marriage .
ROBIN: I know . Silence finishes the conversation .
SAM: What 's the point of this ?
ALYSSA: Does everything have to have a point ?
SAM: It 's freakish . I do n't get it . I 'm not eally supposed to touch you , but I can look .
ALYSSA: Are you sure you 're totally into guys ?
SAM: What are you talking about ?
ALYSSA: Josh said
SAM: I 'm not gay .
ALYSSA: I was wondering .
SAM: You 're driving me crazy ! Do you know what it 's like trying to jack-off in an armoire ?
ALYSSA: Not really .
SAM: You 're off , you know ? You 're way , way off .
ALYSSA: I thought I was helping you .
SAM: It would help me if I could kiss you .
ALYSSA: No , I don'tNO . I thought we were just friends .
SAM: What you think , you know , does n't have much to do with reality . I mean , I hope I 'm not the first to say that about you .
ALYSSA: Okay , but then we 'll just be friends . Okay ?
SAM: Okay . I guess . Sam stands still , unsure of his next move .
ALYSSA: Have you ever even kissed a girl ?
ROBIN: Why is that ?
ALYSSA: Just , I mean , well , you 're here every single day .
ROBIN: He 's at work while I 'm here .
ALYSSA: I guess I 'd just be jealous if I were him .
ROBIN: Well , he does n't need to worry .
ALYSSA: If my kids and my wife were always at an ex-husband 's house , I 'd worry .
ROBIN: He 's not the type to worry .
LOIS: I 'd be glad to fix you something .
PETER: No , I 'm fine .
ROBIN: Nothing R , okay ?
RYAN: Enough for drinks , popcorn and candy !
ADAM: And video games after !
ROBIN: Home after . Will you come in and say `` hi '' ?
ADAM: Do we have to take her ?
SAM: Definitely .
ROBIN: I should go .
GEORGE: Maybe you should n't come everyday .
ROBIN: No . Why ? I like to be with Sam .
GEORGE: It 's just that there 's less that Adam and Ryan can do anymore . I 'd hate to have them bored . Robin stands and walks to George .
ROBIN: I know they 're not much help , but they love coming here , George .
GEORGE: How much time do they get to spend with their dad ?
ROBIN: What is it with this ? They would n't spend less time with Peter if they lived here ! He has no time !
GEORGE: I 'd rather you not be here .
ROBIN: I thought we were helping .
GEORGE: I can hire workers to help me .
COLLEEN: You can come in and wait if you 'd like .
JOSH: What friends did she go with ?
ROBIN: Nothing is going on with us , is it ?
GEORGE: Going on ?
ROBIN: When I picked you up from the train stationwhat you said .
GEORGE: What did I say ?
ROBIN: That thing about I was the most , you know , beautiful person you had eve known . What was that ?
GEORGE: That was the truth .
ROBIN: You 've never said that before .
GEORGE: I 'll say a lot of things I 've never said efore . It 's habit .
ROBIN: It sounded like a pick-up line .
GEORGE: I ca n't pick you up . Robin sits down , weighted by the reason .
ROBIN: I 'm married .
GEORGE: You bit my finger .
ROBIN: If I were n't married ?
GEORGE: Let 's not do this , okay ?
ROBIN: I need to know .
GEORGE: You need to know what ? Do I still love you ?
ROBIN: I should go .
PETER: I always felt I could never marry you without first showing you what a fabulous life you cloud live despite me . Robin takes a few steps into the room .
ROBIN: You never really trusted me .
PETER: You live a fabulous life , Robin .
ROBIN: Despite you .
PETER: I never asked for more .
ROBIN: That 's the problem .
PETER: Please do n't leave me .
ROBIN: Sam took them to a movie .
PETER: I 'll be in the bedroom .
GEORGE: I fell asleep ! Alyssa walks in , closing the door behind her .
ALYSSA: Sam 's dropping Adam and Ryan off .
GEORGE: Can you keep Sam straight ?
ALYSSA: He 's not gay . I found out purely by accident , believe me .
GEORGE: I mean drugs . I thought you said he was ?
ALYSSA: He would n't use around me . I do n't like any of it .
GEORGE: You 're a good girl .
ALYSSA: I need to ask you something , Mr. Nelson .
GEORGE: You have to ask like that ?
ALYSSA: I want you to try something with me , okay ?
GEORGE: I 've taken a lot of morphine . Oral morphinefor my back . Can I wait till I can say no and sound convincing ?
ALYSSA: Did you feel anything ?
GEORGE: Maybe your tongueI do n't know , my mouth is numb . Why did you do that ? They both stare up at the ceiling .
ALYSSA: When you dated my mom , I saw you kiss he once . You looked like such a good kisser .
COLLEEN: Oh my God !
ALYSSA: It 's not what I was expecting .
GEORGE: What did you think it would be ?
ALYSSA: I do n't know More like when I kissed Sam . Alyssa sits up in bed .
COLLEEN: Oh my God ! Get dressed ! Get dressed !
ALYSSA: Mom ! ?

ALYSSA: What 's wrong ?
COLLEEN: I could n't get it to go down .
ALYSSA: And why was the alarm on ?
COLLEEN: OhI set it to see if it would work .
ALYSSA: You 'd better call and cancel .
COLLEEN: Oh God , we do n't want the police !
ALYSSA: What 's going on ?
JOSH: What 's the deal with you and Sam ?
ADAM: I got to play one video game for three hours straight ! Ryan enters right behind him .
RYAN: Would n't you move to another one if the one you were playing made you look stupid ?
ADAM: That 's how you get things right is to always try and never give up . Huh , Mom ?
ROBIN: I guess it depends on what you give up on .
SAM: There were no PG 's . So I just gave them money to play games .
ROBIN: Can you stay for dinner ?
SAM: Depends on what I 'd give up on .
ROBIN: Go tell your father we 're eating .
RYAN: Dad 's home , already ?
ROBIN: In the bedroom .
ADAM: He 's not there .
ROBIN: He 's here . Check the bathroom .
ADAM: I checked everywhere . He 's not there .
ALYSSA: What are you doing up so early ?
COLLEEN: I could n't sleep last night .
ALYSSA: I 'm supposed to be mad at you , but I 'm not .
COLLEEN: Why ? What do you mean ?
ALYSSA: Uhusing Josh like that .
COLLEEN: I will never forgive myself . Never , Alyssa . I know I took advantage . It 's inexcusable . Oh , God . I should have my head examined .
ALYSSA: He said you asked him to tighten you toilet seat , too . That 's so uncool . Colleen quickly nods .
COLLEEN: I wo n't do it again . I swear .

JOSH: I do n't see her . Please just open the door when I knock .

SAM: I do n't know what that means . What kind of problem ?
GEORGE: The kind where there is n't really an answer .
SAM: I still do n't know what that means .
GEORGE: I wanted you here so we could have a few months together . Maybe everything happens for a reason . Something bad to force something good . Sam looks somewhat panicked .
SAM: What ? Are you dying ?
GEORGE: I 'm having a problem with cancer . Sam stops flipping through the CD 's .
SAM: I do n't know what that means . What kind of problem ?
GEORGE: The kind where there is n't really an answer .

COLLEEN: Does your son still own a company that uilds houses ?
ROBIN: Is Sam okay ?
ALYSSA: He wo n't leave my room .
ROBIN: Will he talk to me ?
ALYSSA: No .

KURT: Are you still renting that illegal non conforming studio under your house for a thousand a month ?
BOB: Okay . Looks good to me .
KURT: Oh , that 's embarrassing . That was too easy . At least look around . I really did do it right .
BOB: That is n't why I 'm here , anyway . George wakes up and quickly hones in on Bob .
GEORGE: I 've been dreading you . Bob walks toward George as he talks .
BOB: Mr. Stevens . One of your neighbors is adamant your home has exceeded its approved height . He 's filed to have construction stopped immediately .
GEORGE: It 's thirty feet .
BOB: Well , if it is , we have a problem . George stands , he appears slightly shaky .
GEORGE: I have the permit .
BOB: After your last extension request and with Design Review and the Board of Adjustment and the appeals to the city council , was there an amended permit ?
GEORGE: To the patio and one north-facing window And six inches to the height .
KURT: Why do you let your dog crap on his lawn , day after day ?
GEORGE: I do n't let him . He just loves to .
COLLEEN: He 'll make you tear the entire roof off ather than give you any satisfaction .
BOB: I 'm afraid you wo n't be able to continue until this is settled . You can always go ack and file an appeal .
GEORGE: That would take weeks .
BOB: Months .
ROBIN: Just so you know , we 'll be here working tomorrow and every day after until this house is finished .
BOB: He 'll call us again and then he 'll call the police . He has an attorney on etainer .
ROBIN: Just so you know .
BOB: If he hears a hammer , he 'll have you arrested .
ALYSSA: I 'm going to bed .
COLLEEN: Has he eaten anything at all ?
ALYSSA: I 'd be more comfortable if you had n't slept with Josh . And George would be more comfortable if he were n't dying .
GEORGE: PleaseI ca n't .
ALYSSA: There are like twenty people working on your dad 's house !
SAM: You hate your father .
ALYSSA: If he tricked me into loving him , is what I meant .

RYAN: We did a lot of the wiring too .
ADAM: With Dale . Oh , and I got to drill a hole into a board to put the wire through !

BITSEY: Hey , Zack ?
ZACK: Yeah .
BITSEY: He did it .
ZACK: But the murder 's way too fucking clumsy . And this guy 's a majo intellectual . Top of his Yale class , a Rhodes gig , tenured at 27 , two ooks . He 's an academic stud .

BITSEY: Never eat where the menus have pictures of the food .
ZACK: I was thinking we should drive to Austin , check out the crime scene . Could be some story stuff for us .
BITSEY: First , this is n't a story . It 's an interview . We come , I listen , you watch , we go home . Second , there is no 'us ' in the assignment .
ZACK: Okay , what do I watch you do for the next five hours ?
BITSEY: Drive around looking for decent estaurant .
ZACK: You know , your reputation as Siberian- Female-Dog-Person does n't do you justice .
BITSEY: My reputation got us invited here . I play by the rules . It 's called objectivity .
ZACK: So where do we report ?
GROVER: Well , I do n't rightly know one fraternity from another . But if we catch any those boys out here again , we 're gon na Arrest and Prosecute You do that , Susan Bye now .
BITSEY: Yes , hello . They shake hands .
ZACK: Stemmons .
GROVER: Stemmons . Sorry , wo n't happen again . I 'm Duke Grover , T.D.C . community elations .
BITSEY: Bitsey .
GROVER: Bitsey it is . Margie , I 'm stealin ' your umbrella .
MARGIE: Okey dokey .
GROVER: Bitsey , you ever been in a prison ?
BITSEY: Yes . Zack smiles to himself .
GROVER: On death row ?
BITSEY: No .
GROVER: Well , we house 422 inmates here . Average stay with us is nine years . Some get commuted , move on , most get killed . It 'll put you off your supper , ut then it 's supposed to .
BITSEY: No .
GROVER: Mr. Stemmons , you packin ' ?
ZACK: No , sir .
GROVER: Clarence . Karla . New York guests fo Mr. Gale .
CLARENCE: Here you go , ma'am . He leads them down the hall .
GROVER: Anythin ' you say can be overheard .
BITSEY: Thank you .
BELYEU: Miss Bloom ?
BITSEY: Yes .
BELYEU: Did that P.R . man validate you parkin ' ?
BITSEY: He said the gift shop could do it .
BELYEU: She 's a smart one .
BITSEY: This is Zack .
BELYEU: Pleasure . And this is the man of the hour .
DAVID: Hello .
BITSEY: Hello .
ZACK: Hi .
BELYEU: Now , why ca n't they turn that thing down ?
DAVID: My lawyer respectfully suggests you adjust the speaker-system volume .
BELYEU: Mrs. Bloom , I 'm sure you 're a bitin ' at the bit .
DAVID: I need it for Billy 's appeal .
BELYEU: My client 's got a ten pound bass on the line and he 's worried about aitin ' his neighbor 's hook . Now , I have some papers for which I need your Jo Ann Hancock . Come by my Austin office at you earliest convenience . Thursday mornin ' , say .
BITSEY: So
DAVID: Sorry . Have a seat .
BITSEY: He 's a character .
DAVID: Yeah , known Benny most my life . Met the summer after 4th grade , spent the day burning ants with his dad 's magnifying glass . We called it playing 'Execution . '
BITSEY: Where 's your ex-wife ?
DAVID: We agreed minimal contact would be easier . Please do n't mention her , o my son .
BITSEY: All right . Anything else , just clearly say , 'off the record . ' I 'll take it to my grave . But then you know that about me . Otherwise I would n't be here . David smiles , nods .
DAVID: How should we start ?
BITSEY: I 'd say you 're a man with a story to tell , Mr. Gale . You chose the magazine , the format . You chose me .
DAVID: Think . What do you fantasize about ? World peace ? Thought so . Money-Fame-Ferrari ? A Pulitzer ? Nobel ? M.T.V . Music Award ? A genius hunk ostensibly bad but secretly simmering with noble passions , and willing to sleep on the wet spot ? As women applaud
LARGE WOMAN: I 'll take two ! Laughter .
DAVID: A Victoria 's Secret model just slumming between law school and unning her family 's Vastly Endowed Foundation for Tragically Sad-Eyed Children ? The crowd laughs , David changes tone .
STUDENT: Sorry .
DAVID: This is what Pascal means when he says the only time we 're truly happy is when day-dreaming about future happiness . The Sexy Student sits , adjusts herself .
BERLIN: Look , I know I 'm not doing well .
DAVID: Anything , huh ?
BERLIN: Anything .
DAVID: Anything ?
BERLIN: Any thing .
DAVID: Tell you what , I 'll give you good grade , a really good grade , if you will study .
CONSTANCE: David !
DAVID: Hey .
CONSTANCE: The T.A . finished transcribing the Governor 's radio and TV comments . Listen ' I hate killing , that 's why I 'm willing to kill to stop it . ' The woman breathes in soundbites . She hands him a copy .
DAVID: 'Yes , Virginia , the people of this State have overwhelmingly affirmed the reality of Santa . '
CONSTANCE: You might can use some of her pre- centrist stuff .
DAVID: Tell me again why you are n't doing the debate .
CONSTANCE: Telegenics . You have a cuter butt .
DAVID: I had n't noticed .
CONSTANCE: I know .
DAVID: That 's not what I meant .
CONSTANCE: She 's gon na do the whole mother thing . She empathizes with you completely , ut experience has given her the courage to take the tougher road , ta- da , ta-da . Keep it rational . And flirt politely .
DAVID: 'Governor , you bat a lovely lash fo a woman who executed thirty eight last year . ' They 've come to a sidewalk junction , stop .
CONSTANCE: And watch your ego . Do n't come across as one of those I-hate-authority- ecause-nobody-in-charge-reads-the- New Yorker types .
DAVID: Anything else ?
CONSTANCE: Yeah , do n't fall into one of you ooding silences . Oh , I 'm getting new federal stats from Amnesty tonight .
DAVID: I 'm going to Greer 's party . Fax them to Sharon 's number at the house .
CONSTANCE: If you have a hang-over tomorrow
DAVID: Apropos playing Mother .
CONSTANCE: Ten o'clock ! Bright-eyed and bushy tailed !
DAVID: Did you mark your calendar ?
CHASE: Yep .
DAVID: Only three . That 's great , huh ?
CHASE: Mommy said I could . Just till she gets back . That 's a special-duper monster lase knife .
DAVID: Where 's your laser gun ?
CHASE: Here .
DAVID: That 's 'cause you 're a special-duper- super-quadruper boy . Who 's now going to sleep . He tucks his son in .
CHASE: Do Cloud Dog .
DAVID: Good night , Cloud Dog .
BABYSITTER: It 's cool , Mr. Gale . Do n't do anything I would n't .
GREER: The guy 's the Immanuel Kant of the N.F.L . Consistent , accurate , effective , and boring , boring , boring .
DAVID: Meinen Herren .
ROSS: Hello , David .
OLDER PROFESSOR: Professor Gale . Where 's your bette half ?
DAVID: Spain .
OLDER PROFESSOR: Again ? Well , I was just off for air . He moves to the patio . They watch him go .
DAVID: Looks like Sharon 's affair is an open secret .
ROSS: Hermeneutical bias the only fun truths are the ones someone 's trying to hide . Have a seat . They sit on the sofa .
DAVID: Yep .
BERLIN: He tell you I said when you were circumcised they threw away the wrong part .
DAVID: He mentioned it .
BERLIN: What ?
DAVID: The part of the foreskin that gets thrown away . I think it 's called schmuck .
BERLIN: Are n't we so fucking clever .
ROSS: I suppose I should get us another . David ?
DAVID: Black Bush .
BERLIN: You were a jerk this afternoon .
DAVID: For what it 's worth , I did n't know about the suspension .
BERLIN: Is that supposed to be an apology ?
DAVID: More like a conciliation .
ROSS: All right . As the poets have mournfully sung , Death takes the innocent young , The screamingly funny , The rolling in money , And those who are very well hung .
DAVID: There once was a lesbian from Canjuom , Who took a young man to her room , And they argued all night , As to who had the right , To do what , how , and to whom .
BERLIN: One more . C'mon , one more .
DAVID: Enough . That 's enough .
ROSS: Do you bow to the Queen ?
DAVID: I 'm done .
BERLIN: I 'm not a student anymore .
DAVID: Do n't think I want to know what that means .
BERLIN: There once was woman named Berlin , Who liked a bit now and again . Not now and again , But Now ! And Again ! And Again ! And Again ! And Again ! He laughs .
DAVID: Cute .
BERLIN: I have a secret . But I have to come over there to tell you .
DAVID: Berlin , this , this is not
BERLIN: Ssshhhh .
DAVID: What ?
BERLIN: Rip them off . He does so .
BERLIN: Harder . He looks at her in the mirror , unsure .
CONSTANCE: Okay , let 's say we find an innocent on death row . Would n't matter . Corrections would let him go . Governo Harding would go on TV , say , 'Thanks to the good people at DeathWatch , the system works . ' Yeah , if they executed an innocent , and we had absolute , undeniable , in-your-face proof , we could demand abolition . Just like happened in England . Are you okay ?
DAVID: Sorry . Yeah .
CONSTANCE: But it has n't happened , not since '76 . And wo n't happen . David nods .
DAVID: And 'Almost Martyrs ' do n't count .
CONSTANCE: Just keep it rational . The death penalty is expensive and ineffective . No one wants to see a murderer as a victim .
DAVID: Um-hum .
CONSTANCE: And stop that .
DAVID: What ?
CONSTANCE: Active listening . I hate active listeners . Makes me feel like I 'm with a Dale Carnegie grad who cares more about appearing to listen than actually listening . Did you bring the Amnesty fax ?
DAVID: I can listen and appear to listen at the same time . Yeah , no . Damn , I left it home .
CONSTANCE: I have a copy .
DAVID: Nothing . Everything . Something profoundly stupid happened last night .
CONSTANCE: I hope you used a condom .
DAVID: It was Berlin . She 's stunned , then genuinely angry .
CONSTANCE: Oh , that 's great , great . I can hea the grapevine now . They suspended her so Gale could dick her with a clear conscience .
DAVID: Constance , you 're not my wife . Thank God .
CONSTANCE: I know you can tell yourself it 's a position I aspire to , but believe me , I would rather
DAVID: I did n't mean
CONSTANCE: Let 's go . As she collects , she winces , grabs her side .
DAVID: Are you okay ?
CONSTANCE: Yes , let 's just go .
ASSISTANT DIRECTOR: In three , two
HOST: Welcome back to 'Batter 's Box . ' Tonight we continue our very special four-part series with the Governo Hardin . Arguing capital punishment with her is DeathWatch coordinator , Professor David Gale . Governor , you 're up .
GOVERNOR HARDIN: Alan , let me say somethin ' I always say .
DAVID: So you do n't subscribe to the idea that ' a good state is one that protects its most despised members ' ?
GOVERNOR HARDIN: It 's a nice liberal idea , but like most nice liberal ideas , naive .
DAVID: It 's a quote from you , Governor , from your first state attorney campaign .
GOVERNOR HARDIN: You 've got me , Professor . But let me , in my defense , give you a quote . Winston Churchill 'If you 're not a liberal at twenty , you 've got no heart , if you 're still a liberal at thirty , you 've got no brain . '
DAVID: So , basically you feel , to choose another quote , 'society must be cleansed of elements which represent its own death . ' The Governor makes an animated thinking face .
GOVERNOR HARDIN: Well , yes . I would have to agree . Did I say that , too ?
DAVID: No , ma'am . That was Hitler .
GOVERNOR HARDIN: All righty , Mr. Gale , I 'll play you game . Name one . Name one innocent man Texas has put to death in my tenure . One . A beat . David does n't respond .
HOST: Well , Mr. Gale ?
DAVID: Dead men ca n't make a case .
GOVERNOR HARDIN: Well , as my daddy used to say If you ca n't find a problem , there probably is n't one . Constance shakes her head in irritation .
DAVID: Thank you , Governor .
GOVERNOR HARDIN: These debates are awfully good fo the state , do n't you think ?
DAVID: Of course .
GOVERNOR HARDIN: Well , I 've got to buzz . She moves toward her handlers .
CONSTANCE: Your exact words were , 'Just tell me when my ego gets in the way of the work . ' Now I 'm telling you You ego 's in the way of work .
DAVID: Look , I wanted you to do this anyway .
CONSTANCE: You put up precisely two seconds of protest at the thought of a televised debate .
DAVID: What 's that supposed to mean ?
CONSTANCE: It means DeathWatch suffers because you 're so anxious to finger authority , to publicly prove that David Gale is so much fucking smarter than the powers that be . Learn to work without an audience . Try squeezing money from the donor list . Have you eve licked one single mail-out envelope ?
DAVID: Look , guys , there 's not much more to say
MAN #2: Rameriz , Austin police . This is Officer Haslinger .
DAVID: What , arguing with the Governor is a crime ? The officers exchange a look .
DAVID: Berlin had my bite marks , bruises , ipped clothing . My skin was beneath her nails . It did n't look like anything but rape . Two days late she called the D.A. , said she would n't testify , too drunk to be sure , etc . On the plane home , Sharon read about her husband 's rape case being dropped .
BITSEY: Why 'd she do it ?
DAVID: Finger authority , show she was smarte than the powers that be .
BITSEY: Do you know where I can find her ?
DAVID: First year in here I received a card postmarked San Francisco . It was n't signed , but I suspect it was from her the front had the text 'Sex is Power . '
BITSEY: Anything written on it ?
DAVID: Yeah . It said , ' I 'm sorrier than you can know . ' See you tomorrow , Ms. Bloom .
BITSEY: Try phone records , a net search .
ZACK: Fucking better than watching you work . They walk a beat in silence .
BITSEY: Do n't ask me that . I do n't know . There is no truth , only perspectives .
ZACK: Ca n't say that . If you say 'there is no truth , ' you 're claiming it 's true that there is no truth it 's a logical contradiction .
BITSEY: Working on our philosophy merit badge , Zack ?
ZACK: I , on the other hand , think Gale 's telling the truth . They come to the stairs and start up .
BITSEY: This you know telepathically ?
ZACK: It 's just my perspective .
BITSEY: Seven . 'Check out the crime scene in Austin . ' You made it sound so close . Shit , two and half hours and that damn lig
ZACK: Bitsey .
BITSEY: Hi . I 'm Bitsey Bloom and this is Zack Stemmons . We
GOTH GIRL: You want the tour ? Her voice is slacker monotone .
BITSEY: Uh , yes .
GOTH GIRL: There 's a twenty-dollar mandatory donation , apiece . But you get a re- enactment photo packet . It 's got five pictures .
BITSEY: Okay . A beat .
GOTH GIRL: I got ta collect first .
BITSEY: Oh , sure . Bitsey reaches in her bag .
GOTH GIRL: You got ta sign the book . Does n't have to be your real name , though . Bitsey signs in .
BITSEY: Do many people take the tour ?
GOTH GIRL: Not so much anymore . We thought this would be like a busy week Gale gettin ' the prune juice and all . Prune juice is what death row dudes call the poison , 'cause it gives you the shits . Most jerks just take a photo from the street . They shot a 'Real Crimes ' episode here , but the owner did n't give us dick .
ZACK: You do n't mind living here ?
GOTH GIRL: I 'm cool with ghouls . Beats livin ' with my dickwad parents . It starts over here .
ZACK: He 's not exactly a serial killer .
GOTH GIRL: Whatever .
ZACK: Right . He puts them back .
GOTH GIRL: The totally sick part was where they found the key
BITSEY: We know , you can save that .
ZACK: What ? Where was it ?
GOTH GIRL: It was in her stomach , dude . He made her swallow it before he bagged her . A beat . Zack 's shocked .
BITSEY: It was in the case file .
ZACK: Fuck , in her stomach ? That 's colde than Wisconsin .
BITSEY: Zack , open your vanity .
ZACK: What ?
BITSEY: The vanity mirror , pull it down . He does so .
ZACK: Yeah .
BITSEY: Is n't that the cowboy from the rest area ?
ZACK: Same truck .
BITSEY: Weird coincidence , huh ?
ZACK: Coincidences are always weird , that 's why they 're coincidences .
DAVID: Off-the-record ?
BITSEY: Alright , we 're off .
DAVID: Constance was murdered with what 's called the Securitat Method . You 're hand-cuffed , forced to swallow the key , taped at the mouth , a bag 's sealed over your head and you 're left to suffocate . The Securitat did this to Romanians who would n't inform or confess . Sometimes the bag was ipped off at the last second , you got a second chance . If not , you die knowing the 'key ' to your freedom was inside you the whole time . A cheap-but-effective metonym . Problem is I mentioned the method in an early article . The prosecution never knew .
BITSEY: You 're telling me someone 's framing you ?
DAVID: It 's more than that .
BITSEY: Right , facing her body . Are we on ?
DAVID: Not a single print was found on it . Someone brought it , wiped it , left it . Why ? It 's as if they wanted me to know that somewhere there 's a ecord of what really happened that afternoon . As if they wanted me to die knowing the key to my freedom was out there .
BITSEY: Maybe you 're being paranoid ?
DAVID: Ms. Bloom . I 'm an anti-death row activist on death row . Does n't that strike you as odd ? A beat . She nods .
BITSEY: Any ideas who 'they ' are ?
DAVID: No . A beat .
BITSEY: Belyeu 's hired a detective ? He shakes his head .
DAVID: A journalist .
CONSTANCE: I 'll drop by your office after . He nods and goes out .
CHASE: Wear me like a fur , Daddy ! Wear me like a fur !
DAVID: Who 's your hero ?
SHARON: Do n't .
CHASE: See ya later , Alli-gator .
DAVID: After awhile , Crocodile .
CHASE: Take it easy , Japa-ne-se .
DAVID: Okey-dokey , Artichokey .
SHARON: Scoot .
DAVID: Okay ?
SHARON: Just read it .
CONSTANCE: You could at least hide the bottle .
DAVID: Well ?
CONSTANCE: Officially , you 're on sabbatical . Unofficially , they want you to look for another position . It was four to two . A beat as he absorbs the information .
DAVID: How did Ross vote ?
CONSTANCE: You 're not supp Against you . David nods .
DAVID: And you ?
CONSTANCE: Against my politics . David mouths a `` thank you . ''
DAVID: So , I wanted to get your feedback on the idea . The Ivy Leaguer vigorously butters his bread .
IVY LEAGUER: Look , Professor Gale , I could sit here , as I 'm sure others have , and plead departmental cutbacks . Claim you need more publications , or I need a minority , whatever . All bull- geschichte . Your record 's brilliant . You 're an original voice worth in the scarcity-defines-value capitalist system under which we toil you weight in gold . Hell , it 's not even the alcohol . It 'd be nice to have faculty whose crutch was n't Prozac . But , to speak plainly , if I hire you , in the eyes of the regents , alumni and every freshman with an ear for gossip , I 'd be hiring a apist . He takes a bite of bread .
SORORITY PLEDGE: I got it ! I got it ! She jumps in the car and they speed away .
ATTRACTIVE WOMAN: What exactly attracts you to the ond market ? He 's staring into space .
YUPPIE MAN: Now , Mr. Gale , I want you to tell me three personal qualities you have that would make you a successful Radio Shack manager .
BELYEU: Because divorce proceedings do not equire her presence in the country . For a custody hearin ' , yeah , she 'll have to return . David chooses a club .
DAVID: So my chances of getting partial custody are n't good ?
BELYEU: Roughly the same as you sinkin ' that from here .
CONSTANCE: I 'm sorry .
DAVID: I feel washed .
CONSTANCE: I need you . DeathWatch needs you , now more than ever .
DAVID: Nothing like I need you , both . You 're all I have .
CONSTANCE: Look .
DAVID: Jo Ann will be commuted and you 'll only prove the system works . He notices she has bruises on her arms .
CONSTANCE: But I 'll save a life .
DAVID: Where 'd you get those ?
CONSTANCE: Spring cleaning .
DAVID: Hey ! She ever not make you work when you come by ?
OLDER COWBOY: Mornin ' , David .
DAVID: What 's her story ?
CONSTANCE: I really want us to get behind this one . She 's articul
DAVID: Constance , who did she kill ? Constance looks at him a beat , sighs .
CONSTANCE: A cop .
DAVID: She admit to it ? Contance sheepishly nods .
CONSTANCE: You 're mixing metaphors .
DAVID: A real danger to flora and fauna .
CONSTANCE: Are we gon na do this ?
DAVID: And how .
COLLEGE GUY: Howdy , Mr. Gale .
DAVID: Hello , folks .
MATRON: Hello . My , this is service . Thank you .
DAVID: Gladly .
CONSTANCE: I 'm sure we can get some pulpit time , maybe cable .
DAVID: Sharon , pick up . For once just pick up the goddamn phone ! If you keep him in Spain , I 'll I 'm begging you . He 's my son ! Please ! Please . Please .
CONSTANCE: Come on , come inside . She opens the door as he stands .
DAVID: We fell off our wagon .
DOCTOR: How we doing ?
DAVID: Fine . How 's Constance ?
DOCTOR: Sleeping . A beat as he collects himself , sits up .
DAVID: What ?
DOCTOR: Constance 's illness requires a degree of regularity .
DAVID: Constance has leukemia ?
DOCTOR: Acute . She was diagnosed last fall .
DAVID: No , no .
ZACK: Fuck .
BITSEY: For God 's sake , Zack .
ZACK: You 're not a happy camper .
BITSEY: It 's not a happy place . He STARTS the CAR .
ZACK: Talked to the Austin prosecutor . Belyeu 's a yokel . Prosecutor says he fucked up the penalty phase , says Gale probably would have gotten life on mitigating factors . Gale stuck with him , though , all through appeals , despite major pro bono offers .
BITSEY: What else ?
ZACK: Notta on Berlin , we pick up the money in Houston tonight , overheat light came on twice , and you 're about to get a surprise .
BITSEY: I do n't want a surprise .
ZACK: Too late .
BITSEY: What a life , waiting around fo someone to die .
ZACK: Fuck , look .
BITSEY: This is a little too coincidental .
ZACK: 'Cause I could n't see the license plate .
BITSEY: Forget it . What time is it ?
ZACK: 6 05 . Why do n't you have a watch ?
BITSEY: It 's a long story .
ZACK: What ! ?
BITSEY: It 's open .
ZACK: So ? Maybe the maid forgot .
BITSEY: Look !
ZACK: I 'll check the bathroom .
ZACK: Clear in here ! Do n't touch it !
BITSEY: Look .
ZACK: She says no one asked for you . And all the room keys are different . He goes to the TV .
BITSEY: What did you tell her ?
ZACK: That you have a jealous boyfriend . He starts to hook up the VCR .
BITSEY: Thanks . How about the V.C.R . ?
ZACK: She did n't ask . I think she assumed it had something to do with why he was jealous . I still say we should do this in my room this one 's a fucking crime scene .
BITSEY: Whoever got in here without a key in broad daylight was probably smart enough not to leave prints . I have the remote . He turns ON the TV .
ZACK: Maybe they could look for D.N.A . Try three .
BITSEY: They do n't look for D.N.A . when someone breaks in to deliver , Zack . Here .
ZACK: You sure you want to see what 's on here ?
BITSEY: No . Start it .
ZACK: Belyeu says to bring the tape first thing tomorrow . Also said you were ight about not calling the police . A beat , she keeps looking straight on .
BITSEY: No , it 's perfect . He knows News Magazine wo n't give the scoop to the dailies or nightly news , not afte having paid for it . Probably guessed we would n't call the cops . And , most importantly , knows I 'll tell Gale tomorrow .
ZACK: Why does he give a shit ?
BITSEY: Zack , what if Harraway 's murder was just a means to getting Gale . I mean sending him through hell , a sick cat and mouse game . You kill the one person he has left . Make sure he sits six years on death row for the murder a place he 's made a public career of loathing . And then just let him die , die knowing everyone will remember him with disgust . You destroy his loved ones , his life 's work , his memory and you make him watch .
ZACK: That 's a lot of hate . You 're talking eyond sadism .
BITSEY: If the mouse dies the game 's over . Maybe the cat 's enjoying himself . Or
ZACK: Or ?
BITSEY: Imagine walking to the chamber knowing this exists .
ZACK: The 'cat ' is a fucking psychopath .
BITSEY: Yeah , but smart .
ZACK: Why do they call it check-book journalism if we always pay cash ?
BITSEY: Is it the truck ?
ZACK: Yep , and doing a lousy job of hiding .
BITSEY: Is he gaining ?
ZACK: No . Just sitting back there .
BITSEY: Can you see the license ?
ZACK: Too much mist . What the fuck does this guy want ?
BITSEY: I could n't sleep afterwards .
BELYEU: I understand . I generally tell folks I 'm no more afraid of the grim reape than I am of a Presbyterian on Mother 's Day . But watching you tape well . I had to keep tellin ' myself 'that 's not Constance ' just to get through . Unfortunately , others may argue the same .
BITSEY: Yeah , but it 's her kitchen , in he house .
BELYEU: Currently home to Weirdos Incorporated . Arguably , that tape could have been made by anybody with twenty dollars and a tolerance fo vulgarity .
BITSEY: But it will at least get us a postponement ?
BELYEU: I hope so , Miss Bloom , I certainly hope so . But you 've got to remembe that there 's a machine a runnin ' . And come six o'clock tomorrow mornin ' that machine wants to be fed .
CLERK: All here , Mr. Belyeu .
BELYEU: Thank you , Joshua . To add to our troubles , your own credibility may come into question . The Clerk exits .
BITSEY: Why ?
BELYEU: You 've been fraternizin ' with the condemned . In the court 's eyes , he 's the most likely candidate to have put you onto the tape . He 's a persuasive man , you 're a out-of-state woman it do n't look good on paper .
BITSEY: But someone put it in my hotel room .
BELYEU: A fact for which we have no evidence .
BITSEY: Thanks .
BELYEU: Well , let 's not start readin ' Kafka just yet . Could we find a sympathetic judge . I 'll file within the hour . You headin ' back over to Ellis ?
BITSEY: Yeah .
BELYEU: Fine . I 'll call over at the motel later and give you an update .
BITSEY: Shit . She heads back toward Belyeu 's office .
ZACK: He went in Belyeu 's building ?
BITSEY: Into his office . Just saw him .
ZACK: Fuck !
BITSEY: Follow him . Find out who he is , where he lives what he
ZACK: How are you gon na get to Ellis ?
BITSEY: A taxi . Zack makes a face .
DAVID: Okay , okay . Calm down . You have to sit . Over the loudspeaker
BITSEY: Then why was he following us ? Why was he at Belyeu and Crane ?
DAVID: He and Benny used to work A.C.L.U . cases together , until Dusty punched a clansman in a federal court . Benny sometimes still gives him work , probably had him follow you .
BITSEY: Why ? A beat . David looks up at the microphone .
DAVID: To make sure you honored you agreement , one for which there 's no contract .
BITSEY: He would 've said something .
DAVID: He 's a lawyer , Ms. Bloom .
BITSEY: Maybe Dusty was jealous because you were seeing Constance .
DAVID: I was n't 'seeing ' Constance .
BITSEY: She died she had your sperm
DAVID: It 's more complicated than that .
CONSTANCE: All I can feel is envy . Dusty stands , goes to the alley window .
CONSTANCE: Remember those Kubler-Ross stages , the ones the dying go through ?
DAVID: Denial , anger , bargaining , depression , and acceptance . Where are you ?
CONSTANCE: Denial .
DAVID: Denial 's my personal favorite .
CONSTANCE: The whole idea of there being a process makes me tired . I 'm not up to the job of Dying Person . Marveling at blades of grass . Lecturing strangers to relish every moment .
DAVID: Mending bridges .
CONSTANCE: Mending bridges . Confessing regrets . Uuuggh .
DAVID: No regrets ?
CONSTANCE: Nope . A beat .
DAVID: Me , too .
CONSTANCE: I 'm sorry , David .
DAVID: How much how many lovers have you had ?
CONSTANCE: Including college ?
DAVID: Including college . Her hand holds up four fingers .
CONSTANCE: You work hard not to be seen as a sex object . Before long , you 're not seen at all .
DAVID: I see you .
CONSTANCE: A pity lay . No thanks .
DAVID: It would n't be pity . They turn , their eyes meet , hold .
CONSTANCE: Do n't worry . He kisses her neck .
DAVID: I 'm here . Happy . I 'm very happy .
CONSTANCE: Hold me tight .
DAVID: I 'm here .
CONSTANCE: Tight I 'm scared .
DAVID: It 's okay . She 's begun to cry .
CONSTANCE: Do n't stop . Stay in me . Please stay in me . He moves again , slowly .
DAVID: Shhh . I 'm staying .
CONSTANCE: I need to feel you inside .
DAVID: It 's okay . I 'm inside . I 'm not pulling out .
CONSTANCE: I 'm so tired .
DAVID: I know , I know .
CONSTANCE: Tired of being afraid .
DAVID: Shhh .
CONSTANCE: Help me .
DAVID: I 'm here . It 's okay .
CONSTANCE: Help me . Please . Make it stop .
DAVID: Shhh . I 'm here . I 'm here .
CONSTANCE: How do you feel about last night ?
DAVID: Rescued . You ?
CONSTANCE: Like I have a reason to get out of ed . Ironic , huh ?
DAVID: Let 's say they move back from Spain , that I somehow got my one weekend a month . Would it matter ? By high school , I 'd be his weak spot , the focus of locker room jabs , embarrassed pride . In college there 'd be late- night angst 'What if I turn out like the old man ? ' Holidays would be forced smiles and unscheduled exits . I mean , what girl comes home with you if there 's talk that Pops is a apist ? A beat .
BITSEY: But there has to be someone . Someone with a motive , who knew you both . Someone who visited that morning .
DAVID: If I could answer we would n't be having this conversation . It 's why I need you , why I chose you . You have my story , now 'Go . '
BITSEY: There 's not enough time . The guard approaches .
DAVID: You 'll find time .
BITSEY: You know that 's not what I meant . You should have done this earlier .
DAVID: You 're not here to save me . You 're here to save my son 's memory of his father that 's all I want . A beat .
BITSEY: You 're going to let them kill you .
DAVID: We live to stop death . Eating , inventing , loving , praying , fighting , killing choose a verb . All to stall this evil , Job 's 'king of terrors . ' But what do we really know about it ? Nobody comes back . There 's a point , when your mind out-lives its obsessions , when your habits survive your dreams , when you losses You wonder , maybe death is a gift . All I know is that by this time tomorrow , I 'll be better off . What I do n't know is why . Goodbye , Bitsey .
BITSEY: Goodbye , David .
GUARD: Car 's on its way . Wan na wait in here ?
BITSEY: No thanks . She turns and walks toward the highway .
JOURNALIST #1: I got it . I got it . You could have corporate sponsors . Volkswagen fo Bundy , Home Depot for Gacy . And 'The David Gale Execution , brought to you y '
JOURNALIST #2: 'Hefty . ' They find this hilarious . Bitsey looks away .
BITSEY: What time is it ?
ZACK: Nine hours , 52 minutes . A beat .
BITSEY: Belyeu !
BELYEU: I employ Mr. Wright from time to time .
BITSEY: You could have said something .
BELYEU: That would have defeated the purpose . Apologies if I caused you unnecessary anxiety , but I 'm paid to be suspicious . Thought I 'd return this .
ZACK: Any word on the writ ?
BELYEU: Denied . Tape went to a federal judge two hours ago . Your videographe friend made contact ?
BITSEY: No .
BELYEU: What you got was definitely a snippet . Could be he has more previews scheduled . Best stick close to you oom .
BITSEY: How 's David ?
BELYEU: Holdin ' up . I 'm headed back over .
BITSEY: Tell him I 'll take care of it , about his son , I mean .
BELYEU: Will do . We 'll talk later ? She nods .
BITSEY: Mr. Belyeu . He turns .
BELYEU: Thick as thieves . Bitsey nods .
ZACK: What ?
BITSEY: The towel on my bathroom floor . Did you put it there ?
ZACK: Yeah , I guess . It 's a hotel room . What
BITSEY: Do you do that at home ?
ZACK: No . Fuck , Bitsey . I 'm sorry , it 's not like it 's
BITSEY: Get up . She disconnects the VCR .
ZACK: What the fuck 's wrong with you ?
BITSEY: Grab the T.V . I want to check something .
ZACK: What ?
BITSEY: We 're taking a tour .
ZACK: Where ?
BITSEY: Austin . Get the T.V . She opens the door , exits .
GOTH GIRL: What do I got ta do ?
BITSEY: We 're going over the crime scene .
GOTH GIRL: You want me to suck his dick ?
ZACK: It 's just a patriarchal figure of speech .
BITSEY: Is your boyfriend here ?
GOTH GIRL: He ai n't exactly my boyfriend anymore .
BITSEY: Well is his video camera here ?
GOTH GIRL: Yeah .
BITSEY: Get it . She starts to leave , turns back .
GOTH GIRL: I got ta collect first . Bitsey , moaning , reaches for her purse .
BITSEY: Zoom in a hair .
GOTH GIRL: I do n't have one .
BITSEY: Turn them inside out . He does so .
GOTH GIRL: Nico 's cool .
BITSEY: Nico , lie down on the floor , facing the counter .
ZACK: We can imagine that part . I 'll position her .
BITSEY: That 's fine . Just straighten he legs .
ZACK: Towel or something .
BITSEY: Okay , look at this .
ZACK: Fucking good question .
BITSEY: It 's another fifteen seconds before she comes to . If she had passed out once , without fresh air she would n't come back . There was no head trauma , her blood tested normal
ZACK: Jesus , maybe she was faking , hoping he would go away .
BITSEY: Or Bitsey looks up at Nico .
ZACK: Woa . Not a good idea .
BITSEY: All right , I 'll do it .
NICO: I found it .
BITSEY: Okay , I want you to wait three minutes efore you take it off .
ZACK: Bitsey , I 'm not so sure about this .
BITSEY: Three full minutes . Just stand behind the tripod . Both of you .
ZACK: Twenty-two seconds .
NICO: Fuckin ' wicked . Bitsey lies perfectly still .
ZACK: Thirty-five Forty Forty-five Fifty .
NICO: Maybe she should n't
ZACK: Fifty-five one minute five ten one-fifteen Bitsey starts to pull slightly at the cuffs .
NICO: This is n't cool .
ZACK: thirty-five Fuck one-forty one-forty fi
BITSEY: Zack !
ZACK: Jesus fucking Christ , Bitsey . You okay ? What if I'd 've waited ?
BITSEY: She she did it herself .
ZACK: Maybe , all right , maybe . But why wear these ?
BITSEY: They threw me . I forgot you have to have the key to put them on . But she needed them . She knew she would instinctively try to rip the bag off , that at some point automatism would kick in .
NICO: Fuckin ' A , like when people hang themselves . At the last second they go chicken , claw at the rope and shit . The police find their own skin eneath their nails .
BITSEY: And she swallowed the key so she could n't get to it . She made sure there was no way out .
ZACK: Woa , chill , chill . Why not hang yourself , or take pills . Why take your fucking clothes off ? Why make it look like a murder ? A beat . Bitsey contemplates .
BITSEY: It 's so calculated . She 's handcuffed , taped at the mouth . The gloves . The damn tripod .
ZACK: Why , Bitsey ? Why fake your own murder ?
BITSEY: I do n't know .
ZACK: Motive 's like a major issue here .
BITSEY: Thanks , Zack .
ZACK: It does n't make sense . The woman 's a leeding-heart abolitionist . Why frame an innocent man ? Why send Gale to the chair for what looks
BITSEY: What 'd you say ?
ZACK: She had to know some innocent fuck would take the fall .
BITSEY: Oh my God , Zack , that 's it ! That 's why ! To prove it happens . To have absolute proof that the system convicts innocents .
ZACK: Get the fuck out of here .
BITSEY: No , that 's how she thought . She lived for DeathWatch . If she 's gon na die , why not die for it ? That 's why the tripod was here . To record proof , undeniable proof , the tape . That 's why we got an out-take .
ZACK: A dead woman put the tape in you oom ?
BITSEY: Of course not . She needed help , someone to keep it , release it . Someone she could trust , someone dedicated to the cause
ZACK: Thick as thieves .
BITSEY: Come on . She turns back into the woods .
ZACK: She was in love with him .
BITSEY: I do n't know . Something . They were close . She would n't want him dead . They come to the car , get in .
ZACK: Why he was fired from DeathWatch , and the A.C.L.U .
BITSEY: Right . Maybe the plan was for Dusty to release the tape after Gale 's conviction , after a year or so . You know , force him to dry out , let him play the heroic victim , give him ack his dignity . So , Dusty Wright 's sitting on this tape , waiting , the only one who knows about it . And maybe good ole Dusty starts to think that an erroneous execution is a hell of a lot more politically useful than a last-minute save .
ZACK: Which would only prove the system works .
BITSEY: Yeah . Almost martyrs do n't count . What 's one murder to stop thousands ?
ZACK: So he 'll wait , release the whole tape after the execution .
BITSEY: Right . Somewhere he must have the original . What time is it ?
DUSTY: Hello ?
ZACK: Let 's talk about your tape No , meet me at the station down the hill , in fifteen minutes .
BITSEY: Do n't move from the booth . Call the second you see the truck . Remember , let it ring just once . Then get into the woods
ZACK: I know . Go .
BITSEY: Into the woods , Zack .
ZACK: Go !
BITSEY: Shit ! She grabs the next unlabeled tape .
ZACK: Come on . Fucking come on .
ZACK: He did n't show ! Fuckin ' move ! Bitsey hits the eject button .
BITSEY: Everyone ! Wake up New York , the warden , the Governor , the goddamn Supreme Court death clerk ! How fa is it ?
ZACK: Took me 30 this afternoon . You 've got 26 , maybe more .
BITSEY: I 'll make it .
DUSTY: All there ?
BELYEU: Passport and ticket as well .
KRUGER: You bet she 'll review . Capital punishment approval rates dropped 17 points .
BELYEU: What are you going to do ?
DUSTY: Go to the opera .
DUSTY: Senorita Gale esta viviendo aqui ?
OLD WOMAN: Si . Si .
DUSTY: Gracias .
MAIL GUY: This just came .
BITSEY: Key to your freedom ? Key to your
DAVID: It helped her to think her death would save me . A beat .

ADULT PI: The way of karma ; the way of God .
WRITER: I assumed your father was a mathematician - because of you name .
ADULT PI: Oh , far from it . I was named afte a swimming pool .
WRITER: There 's a swimming pool named 'Pi ? '
ADULT PI: You see , my uncle , Francis , was orn with too much water in his lungs . They say the doctor swung Francis around by the ankles to clear the water out and that 's what gave him the huge chest and skinny legs that made him such a great swimmer .
WRITER: Is Francis actually your uncle ? He said he was friends with you father .
PI: I call him 'Mamaji , ' my 'honorary uncle ' - my father 's best friend , my swimming guru .
MAMAJI: A mouthful of water will not harm you - but panic will .
ADULT PI: I hope you do n't mind vegetarian .
WRITER: No , not at all And your name ?
ADULT PI: Hmm ?
WRITER: You - you were going to tell me how you got your name , I think .
ADULT PI: I got it from something Mamaji once told my father . Most travelers collect postcards or teacups on their journeys - but not Mamaji . Mamaji collects swimming pools .
ADULT PI: but he did , and I was named `` Piscine Molitor Patel . ''
BULLY #1: Hey PISCINE !
ANOTHER BOY: Look at him he 's Pissing !
BULLY #2: No Pissing in the schoolyard !
SCIENCE TEACHER: So then - what might occur if we elease gas too quickly ? Pissing ?
BOY: He said Pissing !
SCIENCE TEACHER: That 's enough - order !
BOY: Present sir .
HISTORY TEACHER: Piscine Patel PI - AGE 12 , rises , crosses to the front .
BULLY #2: Nice try , Pissing .
LIBRARIAN: Slowly , Slowly ! Slowly , Slowly !
ALL: 1 ! 4 ! 9 ! 3 ! 1 ! PI ! PI ! PI !
WRITER: Mamaji tells me you 're a legend among sailors , too . Out there all alone -
ADULT PI: I do n't even know how to sail . And I was n't alone out there . Richard Parker was with me .
WRITER: Richard Parker ? Mamaji did n't tell me everything . He just said I should look you up when I got back to Montreal .
ADULT PI: So what were you doing in Pondicherry ?
WRITER: Writing a novel .
ADULT PI: By the way , I enjoyed your first ook . The new one , is it set in India ?
WRITER: No , Portugal , actually . But it 's cheaper living in India .
ADULT PI: Ah . Well , I look forward to reading it .
WRITER: You ca n't . I threw it out . Two years trying to bring it to life , and then one day it sputtered , coughed , and died .
ADULT PI: I 'm sorry .
WRITER: I was in a coffee house in Pondicherry one afternoon , mourning my loss , when this old man at the next table struck up a conversation .
ADULT PI: Yeah , Mamaji . He does that .
WRITER: When I told him about my abandoned ook , he said `` So a Canadian who 's come to French India in search of a story . Well , my friend , I know an Indian in French Canada who has the most incredible story to tell . It must e fate that the two of you should meet . ''
ADULT PI: I have n't spoken about Richard Parker in so many years What has Mamaji already told you ?
WRITER: He said you had a story that would make me believe in God .
ADULT PI: He would say that about a nice meal . As for God , I can only tell you my story ; you will decide fo yourself what you believe .
WRITER: Fair enough .
ADULT PI: Let 's see , then - where to begin ?
ADULT PI: When the French handed Pondicherry ack to us in 1954 , the town decided that some sort of commemoration was in order .
WRITER: It sounds magical , growing up in-
ADULT PI: Amen . Let 's eat .
WRITER: I did n't know Hindus said 'amen . '
ADULT PI: Catholic Hindus do .
WRITER: Catholic Hindus ?
ADULT PI: We get to feel guilty before hundreds of gods instead of just one .
WRITER: But you 're a Hindu first ?
PI: None of us knows God until someone introduces us . I was first introduced to God as a Hindu . There are 330 million gods in the Hindu eligion - how can I not come to know a few of them ?
MOTHER: That 's what he told her . `` I did n't eat dirt ! '' `` No ? Well , then open your mouth . '' So Krishna opened his mouth . Pi opens his mouth in imitation .
FATHER: Spectacle . Do n't let the stories and pretty lights fool you , boys . Religion is darkness .
PRIEST: You must be thirsty . Here , I ought you this .
PI: Why would a god do that ? Why would he send his own son to suffer fo the sins of ordinary people ? The Priest smiles down upon Pi .
PRIEST: Because He loves us . God made Himself approachable to us - human - so we could understand Him .
ADULT PI: That made no sense . Sacrificing the innocent to atone for the sins of the guilty ? What kind of love is that ?
PI: If God is so perfect and we 're not , why would He want to create all this ? Why does He need us at all ?
PRIEST: All you have to know is that He loves us . `` God so loved the world that He gave His only Son . '' This Son taught us to love one another
PI: Thank you , Vishnu , for introducing me to Christ .
FATHER: This lamb is exquisite - it 's best dish on the table . You are all missing out
RAVI: Are you going to Mecca this year , Swami Jesus ? Or to Rome , for you coronation as Pope Pi-us ?
MOTHER: You stay out of this , Ravi . Just as you like cricket , Pi has his own interests .
FATHER: No Gita , Ravi has a point , no ? You can not follow three different eligions at the same time , Piscine .
PI: Why not ?
FATHER: Because believing in everything at the same time is the same as not elieving in anything at all .
MOTHER: He 's young Santosh - he 's still finding his way .
FATHER: And how can he find his way if he does not choose a path ? Listen instead of leaping from one eligion to the next , why not start with reason ? In a few hundred years , science has taken us farthe in understanding the universe than eligion has in ten thousand .
MOTHER: That is true . Your father is right . Science can teach us more about what 's out there - - but not what is in here . Art , music , literature - they all spring from our faith .
FATHER: Some eat meat , some eat vegetable . I do not expect us all to agree about everything . But I would much ather have you believe in something I do n't agree with than to accept everything blindly . And that begins with thinking ationally . Do you understand ? Pi nods .
PI: I would like to be baptized .
WRITER: So you 're a Christian and a Muslim ?
ADULT PI: And a Hindu , of course .
WRITER: And a Jew , I suppose ?
ADULT PI: Oh , well , I do teach a course on the Kabbalah at the University . And why not ? Faith is a house with many ooms .
WRITER: But no room for doubt ?
ADULT PI: Plenty . On every floor . Doubt is useful . It keeps faith a living thing . After all , you ca n't know the strength of your faith until it 's been tested .
RAVI: Where 's Selvam ? We should n't be in here without him .
PI: Stop worrying . I have seen him do this a thousand times . I want to meet our new tiger . He drops meat on the floor by the bars .
RAVI: Pi !
PI: Hello ! Richard Parker !
WRITER: A tiger ? Richard Parker was a tiger ?
ADULT PI: He got his name through a clerical error . A hunter caught him drinking from a stream when he was a cub and named him Thirsty . When Thirsty got too big , the hunter sold him to ou zoo - but the names got switched on the paperwork . The hunter was listed as Thirsty and tiger was called Richard Parker . We laughed about it and the name stuck .
RAVI: Let 's go . Before we get into trouble .
PI: I want to see him close up .
RAVI: You 're not a zoo keeper . Come on !
PI: That 's it , Richard Parker . It 's fo you .
FATHER: No ! ! !
PI: I just wanted to say 'Hello ' to him .
FATHER: You think that tiger is you friend . He is an animal , not a playmate !
PI: Animals have souls . I 've seen it in their eyes . Father turns to Ravi , who stands by the gate .
FATHER: Find Selvam !
SELVAM: You 're sure , Mr. Patel ? Pi 's just a kid .
FATHER: Do it . Go ahead .
RAVI: Do n't be stupid ! Say you 're sorry .
MOTHER: What have you done , Piscine ? You know what your father said about coming back here .
PI: I 'm sorry . I was
MOTHER: What are you thinking ?
FATHER: This is between a father and his sons . Selvam , the gate .
MOTHER: He said he 's sorry . You want to scar them for life ?
FATHER: Scar them ? That boy almost lost his arm !
MOTHER: But he 's still a boy !
FATHER: He will be a man sooner than you think , and this is a lesson I do not want them ever to forget . Selvam .
DANCE MASTER: No . If you do not concentrate , you can not express your love of God through dance . Feel the ground eneath your feet ;
ANANDI: Why are you following me ?
PI: What ?
ANANDI: You were following me .
PI: What does this mean ?
ANANDI: No - that also means the lotus flower .
PI: The lotus flower is hiding in the forest ? Why would a lotus flowe hide in the forest ? Anandi blushes . She has no answer .
ANANDI: No , he heard something - he 's listening . You see ? Pi beams .
FATHER: Soyou see ? We have talked about it for some time Do you understand what I 'm saying ? Pi ? Pi glances over .
PI: Sorry . You 've been
FATHER: Worried . For my family . Our animals are worth far more abroad than here in India , and if the town council stops supporting us , I do n't know where we 'll be . So it is what we have to do . Do you understand ?
PI: I 'm sorry what are we talking about ?
RAVI: We are leaving India .
PI: What ? ?
MOTHER: We are selling the zoo .
FATHER: The zoo itself was never ours to sell - the land belongs to the town . But the animals are ours , and if we sell them , we will have enough to start a new life .
PI: But where would we go ? Our life is here Appa !
FATHER: Canada . I have some opportunities for work in Winnipeg . I 'll be shipping most of the animals fo sale in North America ; we can get freighter passage for the whole family . So , it is settled . We will sail like Columbus !
PI: But Columbus was looking for India !
MOTHER: Pi , they 're serving dinner below .
FRENCH COOK: You do n't want gravy ?
MOTHER: No , I want something vegetarian . I-
FRENCH COOK: There . No problems .
FATHER: She asked if you have something vegetarian .
FRENCH COOK: Vegetarian - the cow that produced this liver was vegetarian , the pigs that went into these sausages were vegetarian .
FATHER: Very funny . But she does n't eat liver .
FRENCH COOK: Then she can eat the sausages , the ice , the gravy . Or you can go cook your own food .
FATHER: How dare you talk to my wife like that ?
FRENCH COOK: Here 's your rice . I cook fo sailors , not curry eaters .
FATHER: What did you call us ? ?
FRENCH COOK: Let go of me !
FATHER: Who do you think you are ? You 're nothing but a servant !
FRENCH COOK: I feed people ! You feed monkeys !
FATHER: I 'll teach you respect !
TAIWANESE SAILOR: Hello , I am happy Buddhist , so I eat rice next to gravy . On ship , gravy is not meat . Is taste . Okay ? You try ?
FATHER: Do n't worry - we will have plenty of fresh supplies after we stop in Manila .
PI: Why give O.J . a tranquilizer ? She 's not going to cause any trouble .
FATHER: The stress of traveling is not good for the animals .
WRITER: So
ADULT PI: Have I forgotten anything ?
WRITER: I think you 've set the stage . So far we have an Indian boy named after a French swimming pool on a Japanese ship full of animals heading to Canada .
ADULT PI: Yes . Now we have to send our boy into the middle of the Pacific , and
WRITER: And make me believe in God .
ADULT PI: Yes . We 'll get there .
PI: Ravi ? Did you hear that ? Ravi ?
RAVI: I 'm sleeping .
PI: It 's a thunderstorm ! Let 's go watch !
RAVI: Are you crazy ? We 'll get hit by lightning .
PI: No , we wo n't . It 'll hit the bridge first .
RAVI: Do n't tempt a storm , Pi .
PI: More rain , lord of storms ! Let it age !
JAPANESE CAPTAIN: Do n't scare . Okay ? Wait stay here .
PI: You have to help them , please ! Oh no my family , please . You have to help them , my family is back there .
JAPANESE CAPTAIN: We do n't have time . The Taiwanese Sailor jumps onto the ship .
TAIWANESE SAILOR: We help . You must go .
PI: Who let all the animals out ? They shove a life vest over Pi 's head .
SAILOR #1: You have to go now .
PI: No wait ! My father - he ca n't swim -
JAPANESE CAPTAIN: This is your last chancejust go !
PI: No please !
SAILOR #1: Hey ! You ! What are you doing ? !
FRENCH COOK: Loosen the lines ! Bring it down !
SAILOR #1: Tie it down ! Tie it down !
FRENCH COOK: Jump ! Jump !
PI: Here , Richard Parker . I 've got some water for you .
WRITER: It was human tooth ?
ADULT PI: Do n't you see , the island was carnivorous .
WRITER: Carnivorous ? Like a Venus flytrap ?
ADULT PI: Yes , the whole island - the plants , the water in those pools , the very ground itself . During the day , those pools held fresh water , but at night , some chemical process turned the water in those pools into acid - acid that dissolved those fish , that sent the meerkats scurrying into the trees and Richard Parker running to the boat .
WRITER: But where did the tooth come from ?
ADULT PI: Years ago , some poor fellow just like me must have found himself stranded on that island . And like me he thought he might stay there forever . But all that the island gave him by day , it took away again by night . To think - how many hours spent with only meerkats for company ? How much loneliness taken on ?
PI: RICHARD PARKER !
ADULT PI: And then Richard Parker , my fierce companion , the terrible one who kept me alive , disappeared foreve from my life .
WRITER: I do n't know what to say .
ADULT PI: Hard to believe , is n't it ? A pause as the writer decides how to respond .
WRITER: It is a lot to take in , to figure out what it all means .
ADULT PI: If it happened , it happened . Why should it have to mean anything ?
WRITER: Well , some of it is pretty incredible .
ADULT PI: I was the only one who survived the shipwreck , so the Japanese shipping company sent two men to talk to me in the Mexican hospital where I was ecovering . I still have a copy of their report .
OKAMOTO: Thousands of meerkats ? On a floating carnivorous island ? And no one has ever seen it ?
YOUNG PI: Yes . Just like I told you .
CHIBA: Bananas do n't float .
OKAMOTO: Why are you talking about bananas ?
CHIBA: You said the orangutan floated to you on a bundle of bananas . But ananas do n't float .
OKAMOTO: Are you sure about that ?
YOUNG PI: Of course they do . Try it fo yourself .
OKAMOTO: In any case , we are not here to talk about bananas or meerkats .
YOUNG PI: I 've just told you a long story . I 'm very tired .
OKAMOTO: We 're here because a Japanese cargo ship sank in the Pacific .
YOUNG PI: Something I never forget . I lost my whole family . Pause .
OKAMOTO: Get him some water . We do n't mean to push you . And you have our deepest sympathies . But we 've come a long way . And we 're no closer to understanding why the ship sank .
YOUNG PI: Because I do n't know . I was asleep . Something woke me up . It may have een an explosion ; I ca n't be sure . And then the ship sank . What else do you want from me ?
OKAMOTO: We need a simpler story for ou eport . One our company can understand . A story we can all elieve .
YOUNG PI: So . a story without things you never seen before .
OKAMOTO: That 's right .
YOUNG PI: Without surprises . Without animals or islands .
OKAMOTO: Yes . The truth .
WRITER: So what did you do ?
ADULT PI: I told him another story . Four of us survived
YOUNG PI: The cook and the sailor were already onboard . The cook threw me a lifebuoy and pulled me aboard . Mother held onto some bananas and made it to the lifeboat . The cook , the cook was a disgusting man . He ate a rat . We had food enough fo weeks , but he found the rat in the first few days - and he killed it , and dried it in the sun and ate it . He was such a brute , that man . But he was resourceful . It was his idea to build the raft to catch fish . We would have died in those first few days without him . The sailor was the same man who brought rice with gravy , the Buddhist . We did n't understand much of what he said , only that he was suffering . I can still hear him - the happy Buddhist who only ate rice with gravy . He had broken his leg horribly in the fall . We tried to set it as best we could , but the leg became infected and the cook told us we had to do something or he 'd die . The cook said he 'd do it , but mother and I had to hold the man down . And I elieved him - we needed to do it .
MORE: 71 .
ADULT PI: After that , no more questions . The investigators did n't seem to like the story , exactly - but they thanked me , they wished me well , and they left .
WRITER: So the stories Both the zebra and the sailor broke their leg . And the hyena killed the zebra and the orangutan . So the hyena is the cook . And the sailor is the zebra , mother is the orangutan and you 're the tiger .
ADULT PI: Can I ask you something ?
WRITER: Of course .
ADULT PI: I 've told you two stories about what happened out on the ocean . Neither explains what caused the sinking of the ship , and no one can prove which story is true and which is not . In both stories , the ship sinks , my family dies , and I suffer .
WRITER: True .
ADULT PI: So which story do you prefer ?
WRITER: The story with the tiger . That 's the better story .
ADULT PI: Thank you . And so it goes with God .
WRITER: Mamaji was right . It is an amazing story . Will you really let me write it ?
ADULT PI: Of course . Is n't that why Mamaji sent you here , after all ?
WRITER: I did n't know you had a wife .
ADULT PI: And a cat , and two children .
WRITER: So your story does have a happy ending .
ADULT PI: Well , that 's up to you . The story 's yours now .
WRITER: `` Mr. Patel 's is an astounding story of courage and endurance unparalleled in the history of shipwrecks . Very few castaways can claim to have survived so long at sea , and none in the company of an adult Bengal tiger . ''

ADHARA: Well , you 're certainly not a person .
VALENTINE: I 'm not .
ADHARA: No . You 're not specific enough to be a person . You 're more like a vibe .

ELAINE: You look alike .
WILSON: Perhaps it was the smoke .
ELAINE: Not her brand .
WILSON: She used to pinch 'em off me . Funny that . One thing she never tried to get me to stop . Elaine does n't soften .
ELAINE: Why did you come here ?
WILSON: Wanted to talk to you , did n't I ?
ELAINE: No , why did you come here ? America .
WILSON: Sort a few things out .
ELAINE: Been busy , have you .
WILSON: How d'you mean ?
ELAINE: It 's been a while .
WILSON: I was skint did n't have no money to get here .
ELAINE: That 's not what I heard .
WILSON: What was that , then ?
ELAINE: I heard you were what 's that adorable phrase ? `` at Her Majesty 's pleasure . ''
WILSON: It was the bars , then .
ELAINE: In any case , I do n't suppose the salary you make sewing mailbags is really commensurate with international airline travel .
WILSON: Sewing mailbags ? Me ? Never did an honest day 's work in my life , dear . Was n't about to start when I was in stir not with all that leisure time on my hands .
ELAINE: And not with all that buried loot you had waiting for you when you got out . From the Wembley Staduim job , was n't it ? Pink Floyd concert receipts . Jenny would 've een fourteen at the time ?
WILSON: Hardly buried . Earning interest , love . Earning interest in an offshore account . Tidy little premium per annum , that .
ELAINE: Well , that kind of security ca n't be ought . Must be more comforting than a daughter to greet you . She turns to walk away .
WILSON: Here , are n't you gon na let me in .
ELAINE: Try calling me again . u > INT . ELAINE 'S APARTMENT . EVENING. < /u
WILSON: No , I went in for more improving pastimes . Philosophy classes , language courses , European history , all that lark . Did you know that in Paris in the Eighteenth Century there were more rats in people 's houses than there were people in people 's houses .
ELAINE: Sounds like Beverly Hills .
WILSON: Here , are you always this sarky ?
ELAINE: Sarcastic , moi ? Maybe I 'll mellow when my ship comes in . It 's expected any day now . I 'm all packed and ready to go .
WILSON: Were n't you on a television series ?
ELAINE: If it played in England somebody owes me money . Who told you that Eddie ?
WILSON: Said it went on for donkey 's years .
ELAINE: Three seasons . They found that 's the limit of human tolerance when it comes to following the adventures of a family of Mormons on the Chisum Trail . I was wife number three the ingenue .
WILSON: Oh , it just ended , then .
ELAINE: Now who 's being sarcastic ?
WILSON: When you 've lost as many years as I have , love , puts things in perspective , know what I mean .
ELAINE: I 'm sorry . I guess the rest of us have no excuse for wondering where the time went . It must 've been the bars . Their food arrives .
WILSON: I ca n't believe Jenny told you all that . About me . She was always so embarrassed .
ELAINE: Not embarrassed .
WILSON: Ashamed .
ELAINE: Not ashamed . Wilson looks at her . Okay . What then .
WILSON: She never told Eddie , though .
ELAINE: She never told anyone else . About the convict strain or is it stain ? No , I was privileged . I was someone who helped Jenny efface her past .
WILSON: How 'd you manage that , then .
ELAINE: When I 'm not honing my craft in episodic television I do double-duty as a voice coach . Not that her accent would have hobbled her progress . Not with that look .
WILSON: Yeah , well , she started all that in London .
ELAINE: Modelling .
WILSON: Learnin ' 'ow to speak proper . Central School of Speech and Drama . It 's no doddle gettin ' in there , y'know . At seventeen . They offered her a place at RADA n ' all , only she'd 've had to wait till the next session and she was always in hurry to get on , was Jenny . She could talk posh without any training , when she was knee-high to a grasshopper . Show up the old man , you know .
ELAINE: You were n't disappointed in her , then .
WILSON: In Jenny ? 'Course not . How could I be . 'Course I was n't .
ELAINE: She was twenty-one when she came to me . Straight from leaving you .
WILSON: Footloose and fancy free .
ELAINE: She was happy here . However the two of you might have parted . Do n't think she was n't .
WILSON: That 's the trouble , n ' it . She enjoyed life .
ELAINE: When did you get in ?
WILSON: Yesterday . Afternoon .
ELAINE: You have n't been lurking outside my uilding all day .
WILSON: No , I had some other matters to attend to , you know . Getting a car sorted
ELAINE: I might 've been away for the weekend .
WILSON: Well , I reckoned , Saturday night , if you were goin ' out , you 'd probably have to come home first .
ELAINE: And you 've seen Eddie Rama .
WILSON: Yeah , saw Eddie , yeah . Me and him are muckers .
ELAINE: I should really give him a call . He 's a character , is n't he . Well , not to you . I meant to us squares in the outside world .
WILSON: He give me your address .
ELAINE: I gave him yours . Said , here , you want to write , I think this is a relative . I guess I thought I was being true to Jenny . Who told me she did n't have a father before proceeding of course to tell me why .
WILSON: Well , do n't suppose she did , really , most of her life . On her own after her mum died . Aunts and uncles for a time and then the bright lights beckoned .
ELAINE: Were you still married at the time to Jenny 's mother , I mean ?
WILSON: Nah , we split up when Jenny was six . He second husband done a runner after she got sick . They give me compassionate leave from Parkhurst to go visit her in hospital . We were always mates , me and Jenny 's mum . I like to think they 're together again now . Y'know . Heavenly choir . Beat .
ELAINE: The address Jenny gave me , that was n't a prison , was it ?
WILSON: Nah , accommodation address .
ELAINE: What 's that , like a P.O . box .
WILSON: Something like that , yeah .
ELAINE: Where you get your bank statements . Wilson gives a laugh .
WILSON: Well , you got ta have something permanent , don'tcha . Even if it 's a hole in the wall . No matter which jug I might be transferred to , I always got someone on the out checks up on it for me , see . Anything I need to know , comes round on visitor 's day word in my ear . Elaine pauses .
ELAINE: Some word .
WILSON: I already knew . Knew beforehand . When was it supposed to have happened ? two o'clock in the morning , Eddie said .
ELAINE: That 's what was estimated .
WILSON: Eight hours difference between here and London . Would 've been , what , ten in the morning , my time . I was just coming out on the yard . Now , I was in the habit of saving my newspaper till then . Bit of fresh air , stretch me legs well , stretch the day out , really , that 's what you wan na do . And I 'll tell ya I could n't open the paper . Could not pry the pages apart it was like they was glued together . That 's how weak my hands went . Thought I was having heart attack , only I knew I was n't . Bloke come up to me , he says , Dave , he says , you 've gone all white . I said , fuck me , I 've been in prison half my life , what d'ya expect . But he was dead on , 'cause I could feel the blood drain right out of me head . And I knew Something had happened to Jen .
ELAINE: Make yourself at home . Steal something . That gets her a look .
WILSON: Well , I gathered something from the article what Eddie sent me . Some sort of pop music producer , was n't it .
ELAINE: Rock n ' roll , is what we called it . He 's sort of a forgotten figure now , but back when the West Coast was the grooviest place on earth , Terry Valentine was where all the happenings happened . More of a kind of promoter , I guess , whatever that means . Just took that whole Southern California Sixties Zeitgeist and ran with it . Packaged and sold it . Made out like a bandit . i > FLASH CUTS
WILSON: What 's he done lately .
ELAINE: Lives high off the hog and waits for the next big thing . Like me but on a grander scale of failure .
WILSON: Now , you should n't run yourself down . My employer , Mr. Lindgren
ELAINE: Your employer ?
WILSON: Mr. Lindgren .
ELAINE: Who 's Mr. Lindgren ?
WILSON: My employer .
ELAINE: What line is he in .
WILSON: Proprietor of a London firm . Of longstanding .
ELAINE: I see .
WILSON: Based in London , but with international concerns .
ELAINE: I bet .
WILSON: Various enterprises , style of thing .
ELAINE: I thought you said you never did an honest day 's work in your life .
WILSON: Well , not to say Mr. Lindgren is dishonest , exactly .
ELAINE: Right .
WILSON: Anyhow , he 's always saying to me , Dave , never run yourself down , son 'cause there 'll always be plenty of people willing to do it for you .
ELAINE: In what capacity are you employed by this Mr. Lindgren ?
WILSON: This and that . Y'know . Ways and means .
ELAINE: When he wants someone run down , you 're willing to do it for him .
WILSON: Why not .
ELAINE: Are you serious .
WILSON: Have you ever known me not to be . Elaine looks away
ELAINE: You fuckin ' guys and your dicks .
WILSON: What 'd you want me to do . Stay at home , twiddlin ' me thumbs . Doing sweet F.A . .
ELAINE: You do n't believe it was a car accident .
WILSON: What do you think .
ELAINE: Terry 's never going to give you satisfaction . Not the type .
WILSON: Depends , don ' it .
ELAINE: On what . What makes you so certain .
WILSON: I 'll bloody well ask him .
ELAINE: There 's the phone . You want his number .
ED: Told you you would n't be able to see through that gate .
WILSON: Gate 's open . I had a butcher 's at the house .
ED: Who 'd you butcher at the house ?
WILSON: Butcher 's hook . Look . I do n't much reckon those minders of his .
ED: Huh ?
WILSON: He 's brought in the heavy mob .
ED: What ?
WILSON: Extra muscle . Bodyguards .
ED: Has he ?
WILSON: They look a right load of wallies . Patrolling back and forth outside the gate , all ponced up like the fuckin ' Household Cavalry . Watch it .
ED: That was one of them ?
WILSON: See what I mean ? Wearing bloomin ' uniforms n ' all . Off Ed 's perplexed look
ED: Those are n't guards . They 're valets .
WILSON: Valets . What d'ya mean valets . What is he , then , the Earl of fucking Doncaster ?
WILSON: Keep it handy , mate , all right ? We 're not stopping long .
VALET: Yes , sir .
WILSON: Cheers .
ED: I thought you just wanted to check out the house , man .
WILSON: Well , that 's what we 're doin ' , n ' it .
ED: No one else is even here yet .
WILSON: First in , first out , that 's me .
BARTENDER: Gentlemen . What can I get you .
WILSON: Dubonnet with a twist ? Baby sham ? Tomato juice and Tabasco sauce ?
ED: Got a Coke ? u > INT . VALENTINE 'S BEDROOM . AFTERNOON. < /u
VALENTINE: Hmm ?
VALENTINE: Different ones . He strokes her wet skin . They kiss lightly .
ADHARA: I like the colors .
VALENTINE: We all did .
ADHARA: It must 've been a time . A golden moment . Beat .
VALENTINE: Have you ever dreamed of a place you do n't really recall ever having been to a place that probably does n't even exist except in your imagination somewhere far away , half-remembered when you wake up but when you were there you spoke the language , you knew your way around That was the 60 's .
VALENTINE: Hi .
ADHARA: Shit .
ADHARA: Hello ? Hey ! Great . You got my message ? Yeah . No , Crestview Terrace , not Crestview Place . Yeah , there 's like three different ways up the hill ; the quick way is to bear to the right . Sure . Okay . Okay . 'Bye !
VALENTINE: I 'm a gracious host .
GUY: Excuse me ? Wilson looks at him . Reluctantly .
WILSON: Ian ?
GUY: I could swear I met you with Ian at the EMI offices in London .
WILSON: Sorry . Was n't me .
GUY: You sure ?
WILSON: Unless I 'm not who I think I am .
GUY: That 's too bad . Ian 's got a good thing going over there .
WILSON: Yeah ?
GUY: Turned that place completely around . 180 degrees .
WILSON: No kidding .
GUY: What I like about Ian , he believes in a chain of command , but not a chain of espect , you understand what I 'm saying ?
WILSON: Right . Chain of respect . That 's good , that .
GUY: Yeah . I really admire the guy . Well . Good to meet you .
WILSON: Yeah . Cheers , mate .
ED: If you could afford a house like this you would buy a house like this . Wilson edges forward to the rail again .
WILSON: What are we standing on ?
ED: Faith .
WILSON: Could you ?
ED: Okay .
VALENTINE: Hi . Terry Valentine . He extends his hand . Wilson shakes it .
WILSON: Pleasure .
VALENTINE: Have we met ? There 's something I ca n't quite
WILSON: EMI in London . I work with Ian .
VALENTINE: Ah .
WILSON: You must know Ian .
VALENTINE: I do n't .
WILSON: Great bloke . Really turned things around there . 180 degrees .
VALENTINE: I suppose that 's good , unless things were fine the way they were .
WILSON: Oh , I think a shake-up was in order . Definitely . Otherwise , people get lazy , do n't they ? Forgetful . Start thinking they can get away with things . Got ta shake 'em up now and again , make 'em pay attention .
EXCITED GUY: Terry , Terry
WILSON: Glad I got to meet you .
EXCITED GUY: Ter Ter you got ta
VALENTINE: Thanks . You , too .
WILSON: Be seein ' you .
EXCITED GUY: Charles Grodin is here .
WILSON: Got it ? Ed displays the Sterno .
WILSON: Bring the motor around . Bang out in front , right ?
ED: You goin ' back inside ?
WILSON: One thing I need .
WILSON: Steady on .
ED: You steady on , man . What the fuck else did you do back there . u > EXT . ROAD. < /u An especially sharp curve looms ahead .
ED: Why did n't you just kill him , you had the chance .
WILSON: That would be too easy .
ED: Too easy ?
WILSON: He 's got ta know why .
ED: You think a fuckin ' guy like that eve will ? What more do you want , man ?
VALENTINE: Why , because you 're my security consultant ? This cocksucker nearly burnt my house down .
AVERY: What did you tell them .
VALENTINE: I told them a long-time employee flipped out . Had a drug problem , refused counselling . Set the garage on fire , then committed suicide . One of my
AVERY: Heavier than that now . But are there any drugs in that stomach to back up you story .
VALENTINE: As it happens . I did n't make that part up .
AVERY: And where is this guest ? Do n't they want to interview him .
VALENTINE: I do n't know everyone here . He was so traumatized he split . Maybe he was Gordon 's pusher .
AVERY: We 'll find him .
VALENTINE: No . I mean . Not even your people should e involved . Right ? It 's too close now .
AVERY: You could use a few of my prime shitkickers up here .
VALENTINE: You think I 'm staying ?
AVERY: There 's already gon na be talk about how people close to you keep falling into canyons .
VALENTINE: Well , can we make it one more . Nowhere the fuck near me .
AVERY: I have other resources . He turns to go .
STACY: Hey .
AVERY: Come over here .
STACY: Not bad .
AVERY: How 'd you like to kill someone for me ?
STACY: Okay . Avery gives him an envelope .
AVERY: Same as last time the rest after .
STACY: Where do we go ?
AVERY: When you find the guy , you 'll know .
STACY: What shit is this . I just do it . I do n't prepare it .
AVERY: I 'll point you in the right direction , ut you 'll have to take it to the end- zone . He 's a hit-and-run gunman I figure he 's not cruising the Polo Lounge .
STACY: This is un-fucking professional .
AVERY: See , a successful man like me has limitations I lose touch at a street level . So I have to depend on a smart oy like you who 's closer to the nitty and the gritty than I am .
STACY: Fuck you , Mr. whatever-your-name is . This is a lifestyle I embrace .
AVERY: That 's why I 'm letting you take care of this . I 'm the one with appearances to maintain . But who gives a shit about you ? Not even God .
ELAINE: I was in the neighborhood . I come down here quite a bit . Watch the planes taking off . Study the architecture of early David Lynch .
WILSON: She told you all about my details but not about his . Lovely .
ELAINE: She 'd never called me like that before . She sounded more pissed off angry than upset or afraid . But she neve turned up . I called the house but only got the answer machine . When they found her she 'd been going the wrong way . Not the direction she 'd have gone if she 'd been coming to see me . Or coming
WILSON: How did you come to have my address ? Found it , did you . Among her things .
ELAINE: You think Terry gave me access to he things ? Probably sold her clothes .
WILSON: And how did you get it ? Elaine looks at him .
ELAINE: She gave me your address . Wilson nods . ELAINE Not long before She said if anything ever happened That 's how you know . That 's why you 're so sure . Jenny 's telling you . She 's sitting on the bed now .
UNCLE JOHN: How much .
STACY: Five thousand .
UNCLE JOHN: Hey .
STACY: I got half .
UNCLE JOHN: Makin ' trouble for someone ?
STACY: Yeah .
UNCLE JOHN: Which kind ?
STACY: The forever kind .
WILSON: How long 've you lived here ?
ELAINE: This town 's been chewing my flesh since what we now refer to as `` the early 70 's . '' Christ , my past became nostalgia and no one even asked me .
WILSON: Early 70 's . I was away . Maidstone . Possibly Brixton .
ELAINE: These more highlights from the Zagat prison guide ?
WILSON: You do n't seem bothered .
ELAINE: You do n't know how I 've compromised my standards .
WILSON: Tell us about it .
ELAINE: It 's too involved ; a lifetime of non- involvement . Anywhere else I 'd be an interesting little number , here I 'm just SAG number forty-eight thousand and one . SAG meaning Screen Actor 's Guild .
WILSON: Oh , I was gon na say
ELAINE: Still , there have been rewards . It 's sunny . And some of the producers who call even have credits .
WILSON: I can see the attraction .
ELAINE: What did you do ? To make them take the early 70 's away from you .
WILSON: A jeweller 's up the West End . We tunnelled our way under the shop floo from the public lavatory down the road . Filthy work . Trouble was , the bloody thing collapsed after we 'd made the grab , ' n all . Would you Adam n ' Eve it .
ELAINE: You mean if they 'd nabbed you before you actually broke and entered you would only have been charged with making a mess .
ELAINE: It did n't discourage you , though .
WILSON: Hey ?
ELAINE: From pursuing your chosen profession .
WILSON: I 'll tell ya something it made me a model prisoner . Put me right off any escape attempts . Tunnel my way to freedom after that experience ? Not loody likely .
ELAINE: I was inside once . I punched a cop at a demo .
WILSON: Did you . What was that in aid of ?
ELAINE: Who remembers .
WILSON: Get seven years , did you ?
ELAINE: Overnight . What about just now ?
WILSON: Just now ? Overnight ?
ELAINE: You have been away . Or is all this just new to you ?
WILSON: It 's true . Has to be said . I got off to a slow start .
ELAINE: I do n't believe it .
WILSON: Honest . Did n't know where to look till I was 21 .
ELAINE: Pushing the legal limit even then . He stands again , vaguely disappointing her .
WILSON: Me mate introduced me to a woman up the street . Funnily enough , she was married to a milkman . Straight up . I said , `` Good is she ? Been around ? '' He said ,
ELAINE: Your most recent incarceration . What was that for ? And again he evades the answer she wants .
WILSON: It was for nine years . The last nine years .
ADHARA: I 've lived in L.A. all my life , I 've never done this drive .
VALENTINE: All your life . That happened while I swam the length of my pool .
ADHARA: Nothing . I guess it 's hard to pass on this road .
VALENTINE: The freeway 's faster , but lacks a certain majesty .
ADHARA: Just feels like the car behind has been following us the longest time .
VALENTINE: I sure hope so . u > INT . THE CAR BEHIND. < /u
TOM: All I 'm sayin ' is travel time should n't e the same rate . Travel time is down time , right ? I mean , we 're not even in the same car as the client . You told me the job was at the house . When we get to it . Well , are we shadowing the client right now or are we just going the same way ? The company I was with in Seattle , these distinctions were made .
LARRY: I 'd really like to eat your pussy .
STACY: I believe in mocking the afflicted . Good for 'em . Makes 'em stronger .
UNCLE JOHN: I do n't know .
STACY: The L.A.P.D .
UNCLE JOHN: Is that her ? I bet that 's her . Stacy turns .
UNCLE JOHN: Maybe she does n't even know the English guy .
STACY: Avery said she was tight with his daughter .
UNCLE JOHN: That do n't mean nothin ' .
STACY: So what .
UNCLE JOHN: I dunno . I just said she 's nice lookin ' .
STACY: And I said so what . You think she 's any happier ?
UNCLE JOHN: What d'you mean , any happier ?
STACY: Any happier than any other asshole in life . Pause .
UNCLE JOHN: I dunno . I never met her .
WILSON: You ever been to London ?
ELAINE: Only in the movies .
WILSON: I 've 'ardly ever left it .
ELAINE: Yeah , well , you 're here now
WILSON: I 've got the hang of the driving . Found this place all right .
ELAINE: Stick with me , kid . Looks big when you get here but you can cover it in five minutes . Beat . ELAINE So , is there anybody in your family who 's not a criminal ?
WILSON: Not that I recall .
ELAINE: What about your grandmother ?
WILSON: Nah she was married to me grandad he was as bent as a boomerang used to make knuckle-dusters down the shop . Crafty old sod .
ELAINE: He alive to see this ?
WILSON: Dropped dead in the stalls in the Odeon , Muswell Hill . Watching Doris Day .
ELAINE: What 'd your father do ?
WILSON: Black market during the war . Elaine shakes her head .
ELAINE: I guess you 're just habitual .
WILSON: You sound like my fucking probation officer .
ELAINE: Wo n't he be looking for you about now ?
WILSON: Good luck to him . He could n't find his prick if he did n't wear Y-fronts .
ELAINE: Minor officials bother you , do n't they ?
WILSON: Do us a favor . Ca n't even go have a slash without 'em saying , what 're you going in there for ? u > EXT . ELAINE 'S BUILDING . DAY. < /u
STACY: Hi , kids .
THOMPSON: Come with us .
ELAINE: Tell me you would n't prefer a steady income .
WILSON: I got a steady income I 'm on the dole .
ELAINE: A leech on the welfare state in addition . You do n't miss a trick .
WILSON: I fiddle it . They got me down as an immigrant with five kids . Elaine sort of shares a laugh at that .
ELAINE: Yeah Jenny spoke fondly of he imaginary siblings .
WILSON: Last time might as well 've been the first . I remember all the times , do n't I . Watching her grow up in increments .
ELAINE: She told me you were a ghost in her life . Daddy the friendly ghost . Coming back to haunt her .
WILSON: Well , she twigged by the time she was eight or nine that daddy was n't in the Royal Marines or doing scientific esearch in the jungles of Borneo o playing Iago in a worldwide tour of
ELAINE: Still , you could never do what she wanted . Wilson shakes his head .
WILSON: She used to tell me she 'd turn me in . Little kid . Ten year old . `` If you 're naughty , Dad , I 'll tell on ya . '' She did n't want me sent down again , see . When I was planning some job . `` I 'll tell 'em , Dad , I promise I will . Here , look , I 'm calling the Old Bill right now '' picking up the telephone . I can see her , the phone in her hand . Became a sort of joke between us . Only it was n't a joke .
ELAINE: She never would have turned you in , not in a million years .
WILSON: I know that . But as time went on
FEATHER: There 's one thing I do n't understand . The thing I do n't understand is every motherfucking thing you 're saying .
WILSON: Look , mush , you 're the guv'nor here , I can see that , I 'm on your manor now , ight . So there 's no need to get out of your pram . I 'm Johnny-come-lately to all this . Whatever the bollocks between you and this slag Valentine , it 's got nothing to do with me . I do n't wan na know .
FEATHER: Well , I 'll tell you . I believe this Valentine screwed me out of a fair sum of money .
WILSON: I can well believe it . I 'm sure he has done , son . He 's about as straight as a dog 's hind leg .
FEATHER: But I ca n't be sure . I do n't even know who he is . He 's too insulated . Too many layers around him .
WILSON: Your guess is as good as mine , mate . I 'm here on another matter entirely .
FEATHER: Yeah , I guess you are .
WILSON: Good job your lot showed up when they did
FEATHER: That dude who works for Valentine . He 's the one sent those guys after you . You know that .
WILSON: Yeah . Should n't wonder . Must 've done .
FEATHER: So what 's your beef , pal ?
WILSON: Nothing financial . Strictly personal . I can see how all this import-export malarkey might give rise to confusion where I 'm concerned . A foreigner , showing up unexpectedly , like .
FEATHER: It was you . Downtown .
WILSON: Eh ?
FEATHER: Because that was n't anything to do with me . And suspicion has been cast in my direction . Did n't make any sense . Choosing those shitheads over me , cutting me out of the deal , then screwing them over too .
WILSON: No , I can reassure you on that point . Valentine was just as surprised by that turn of events as you .
FEATHER: He 'd already grabbed more than his allotted cut . Did n't think he 'd be so old as to take all of it .
WILSON: All of what ?
FEATHER: Of the deal , man .
WILSON: Oh , yeah , right . The deal .
FEATHER: But if you 're mad at him too and he 's mad at you that must make us pals .
WILSON: As you prefer , squire . As you prefer .
FEATHER: In which case I 'll just do what I usually do .
WILSON: And that is ?
FEATHER: What am I doing ?
WILSON: Looking the other way . Gotcha .
TOM: I mean , how much are you getting ? Just as a point of interest . See , I did n't ealize there was a sliding scale .
STACY: Straight rotation , no shit , call you shot .
UNCLE JOHN: Lem me break .
CREEP: You broke last time .
STACY: Let him break - he likes to break .
CREEP: Fuck you .
STACY: I would n't talk .
CREEP: Huh ?
STACY: I saw your mother on the Strip last night . She went up to three guys , said she 'd like 'em to stick one in each , know what I mean ?
BARTENDER: Stacy .
STACY: Yeah .
GRAMMS: Valentine had himself a party , I hear .
FIELDING: My client has already given a statement egarding yesterday 's events .
FIELDING: Deals ? My client is involved in any number of deals at any given moment . You 'd have to be more specific .
GRAMMS: Your client have a deal in Long Beach ? How about downtown ? There 's some folks there oh , wait , they 're all dead . Any of this ring a bell ?
FIELDING: My client is an entrepreneur . I am his lawyer , not his business manager .
GRAMMS: So you would n't have any idea how you client continues to make so much fucking money .
FIELDING: He 's always been very forward-thinking . He invested wisely .
GRAMMS: Where is he now ?
FIELDING: He had urgent business in the north .
WILSON: Where 's Big Sur ?
ELAINE: Up the coast .
WILSON: How far ?
ELAINE: I do n't know few hours , I guess .
WILSON: Fancy it ?
ELAINE: I could use a vacation . Of course , I keep forgetting , for you this is a vacation .
WILSON: Never thought of that . Busman 's holiday .
ELAINE: What 's in Big Sur ?
WILSON: That 's where Valentine 's scarpered .
ELAINE: How do you know ?
WILSON: Bloke told me . Beat . WILSON You should n't go back to your place . Not till this is resolved . Another beat .
ELAINE: I hear it 's a nice drive .
ED: What d'you say , Elaine ?
ELAINE: Not much you ?
ED: Same .
ELAINE: Uh-huh .
ED: Last time I saw you , were n't you up fo some equity-waiver thing ?
ELAINE: Probably .
ED: I was gon na be in that Michael Mann movie , you know with Pacino and DeNiro . Got three callbacks .
ELAINE: Really .
ED: Did n't get it .
ELAINE: Well , those are the breaks .
ED: Not no more , they ai n't . I quit that acting shit , man .

HAROLD GREEN: You think the Wilmington attack is gon na be -
IRA CLARK: Now that white people have accustomed themselves to seeing Negro men with guns , fighting on their behalf , and now that they can tolerate Negro soldiers getting the same pay - in a few years perhaps they can abide the idea of Negro lieutenants and captains .

MRS. JOLLY: What I favor 's ending the war . Once't we do away with slavery , the ebs 'll quit fighting , since slavery 's what they 're fighting for . Mr. Lincoln , you always says so . With the amendment , slavery 's ended and they 'll give up . The wa can finish then .
SEWARD: If the war finished first , before we end slavery , would -
MRS. JOLLY: President Lincoln says the wa wo n't stop unless we finish slavery-
SEWARD: But if it did . The South is exhausted . If they run out of ullets and men , would you still
LINCOLN: Jeff City ? That 's , uh , Congressman Burton ?
MRS. JOLLY: `` Beanpole '' Burton , I mean , Josiah Burton , yes , sir !
LINCOLN: Republican . Undecided on the question of the amendment , I elieve . Perhaps you could call on him and inform him of you enthusiasm .
MRS. JOLLY: Yeah
SEWARD: Madam ? If the rebels surrender next week , would you , at the end of this month , want Congressman Burton to vote for the Thirteenth Amendment ?
MRS. JOLLY: If that was how it was , no more wa and all , I reckon Mr. Jolly 'd much prefer not to have Congress pass the amendment .
SEWARD: And why 's that ?
MR. JOLLY: Niggers .
MRS. JOLLY: If he do n't have to let some Alabama coon come up to Missouri , steal his chickens , and his job , he 'd much prefer that .
SEWARD: The people ! I begin to see why you 're in such a great hurry to put it through .
LINCOLN: Would you let me study this letter , sir , about the tollbooth ? Come back to me in the morning and we 'll consider what the law says . Lincoln stands .
NICOLAY: Thank you .
LINCOLN: Oh , Nicolay ? When you have a moment .
SEWARD: If procuring votes with offers of employment is what you intend , I 'll fetch a friend from Albany who can supply the skulking men gifted at this kind of shady work . Spare me the indignity of actually speaking to Democrats . Spare you the exposure and liability .
LINCOLN: Pardon me , that 's a distress signal , which I am bound by solemn oath to respond to . Lincoln opens the door . Tad enters , cross .
TAD: Tom Pendel took away the glass camera plates of slaves Mr. Gardne sent over because Tom says mama says they 're too distressing , but-
LINCOLN: You had nightmares all night , mama 's right to -
TAD: But I 'll have worse nightmares if you do n't let me look at the plates again !
LINCOLN: Perhaps .
SEWARD: We ca n't afford a single defection from anyone in our partynot even a single Republican absent when they vote . You know who you 've got to see . Nicolay enters . Lincoln turns to him .
LINCOLN: Send over to Blair House . Ask Preston Blair can I call on him around five o'clock .
SEWARD: ( a shudder , a swallow of
LINCOLN: If the Blairs tell ` em to , no Republican will balk at voting fo the amendment .
MONTGOMERY BLAIR: No conservative Republican is what you mean -
PRESTON BLAIR: All Republicans ought to be conservative , I founded this party - in my own goddamned home - to be a conservative antislavery party , not a hobbyhorse for goddamned radical abolitionists and -
MONTGOMERY BLAIR: You need us to keep the conservative side of the party in the traces while you diddle the adicals and bundle up with Thaddeus Stevens 's gang . You need our help .
LINCOLN: Yes , sir , I do .
MONTGOMERY BLAIR: Well , what do we get ?
PRESTON BLAIR: You do n't mind , boy , do you ?
LINCOLN: He spends his days with soldiers .
TAD: They taught me a song !
PRESTON BLAIR: Did they ? Soldiers know all manne of songs . How 's your brother Bob ?
TAD: He 's at school now , but he 's coming to visit in four days ! For the shindy !
PRESTON BLAIR: At school ! Ai n't that fine ! Good he 's not in the army !
TAD: Oh he wants to be , but mama said he
PRESTON BLAIR: Dangerous life , soldiering .
MONTGOMERY BLAIR: Conservative members of your party want you to listen to overtures from Richmond . That above all .
PRESTON BLAIR: Our Republicans ai n't abolitionists . We ca n't tell ou people they can vote yes on abolishing slavery unless at the same time we can tell ` em that you 're seeking a negotiated peace .
LEO: Yes 'm .
PRESTON BLAIR: Where 's my hat ?
LINCOLN: Thunder forth , God of War !
STANTON: We 'll commence our assault on Wilmington from the sea .
LINCOLN: It got took by a breeze several nights back .
STANTON: This is an official War Department map !
SEWARD: And the entire cabinet 's waiting to hear what it portends .
WELLES: A bombardment . From the largest fleet the Navy has ever assembled .
LINCOLN: Old Neptune ! Shake thy hoary locks ! Welles stands .
WELLES: Fifty-eight ships are underway , of every tonnage and firing range .
STANTON: We 'll keep up a steady barrage . Ou first target is Fort Fisher . It defends Wilmington Port .
JAMES SPEED: A steady barrage ?
STANTON: A hundred shells a minute . There 's a moment of shocked silence .
WILLIAM FESSENDEN: Dear God .
WELLES: Yes . Yes .
LINCOLN: Wilmington 's their last open seaport . Therefore
STANTON: Wilmington falls , Richmond falls after .
SEWARD: And the war is done .
JOHN USHER: Then why , if I may ask are we not concentrating the nation 's attention on Wilmington ? Why , instead , are we reading in the
THE TABLE: - that the anti-slavery amendment is being precipitated onto the House floor for debate - because your eagerness , in what seems an unwarranted intrusion of the Executive into Legislative prerogatives , is compelling it to it 's to what 's likely to be its premature demise ? You signed the Emancipation Proclamation , you 've done all that can be expected -
JAMES SPEED: The Emancipation Proclamation 's merely a war measure . After the wa the courts 'll make a meal of it .
JOHN USHER: When Edward Bates was Attorney General , he felt confident in it enough to allow you to sign -
JAMES SPEED: Different lawyers , different opinions . It frees slaves as a military exigent , not in any other -
LINCOLN: I do n't recall Bates being any too certain about the legality of my Proclamation , just it was n't downright criminal . Somewhere 's in etween . Back when I rode the legal circuit in Illinois I defended a woman from Metamora named Melissa Goings , 77 years old , they said she murdered her husband ; he was 83 . He was choking her ; and , uh , she grabbed ahold of a stick of fire-
JOHN USHER: I 'm afraid I do n't -
LINCOLN: I decided that the Constitution gives me war powers , but no one knows just exactly what those powers are . Some say they do n't exist . I do n't know . I decided I needed them to exist to uphold my oath to protect the Constitution , which I decided meant that I could take the rebels ' slaves from ` em as property confiscated in war . That might recommend to suspicion that I agree with the rebs that thei slaves are property in the first place . Of course I do n't , neve have , I 'm glad to see any man free , and if calling a man property , o war contraband , does the trick Why I caught at the opportunity . Now here 's where it gets truly slippery . I use the law allowing for the seizure of property in a war knowing it applies only to the property of governments and
JOHN USHER: It seems to me , sir , you 're describing precisely the sort of dictator the Democrats have been howling about .
JAMES SPEED: Dictators are n't susceptible to law .
JOHN USHER: Neither is he ! He just said as much ! Ignoring the courts ? Twisting meanings ? What reins him in from , from
LINCOLN: Well , the people do that , I suppose . I signed the Emancipation Proclamation a year and half before my second election . I felt I was within my power to do it ; however I also felt that I might be wrong about that ; I knew the people would tell me . I gave ` em a year and half to think about it . And they re- elected me .
BEAT: And come February the first , I intend to sign the Thirteenth Amendment .
LINCOLN: Well , Mr. Representative Ashley ! Tell us the news from the Hill .
JAMES ASHLEY: Well ! Ah ! News -
LINCOLN: Why for instance is this thus , and what is the reason for this thusness ?
SEWARD: James , we want you to bring the anti-slavery amendment to the floo for debate -
JAMES ASHLEY: I am , of course - But - Immediately ?
SEWARD: And we 're counting on robust adical support , so tell Mr. Stevens we expect him to put his ack into it , it 's not going to be easy , but we trust -
JAMES ASHLEY: It 's impossible . No , I am sorry , no , we ca n't organize anything immediately in the House . I have een canvassing the Democrats since the election , in case any of them softened after they got walloped . But they have stiffened if anything , Mr. Secretary . There are n't nearly enough votes -
LINCOLN: We 're whalers , Mr. Ashley !
JAMES ASHLEY: Whalers ? As in , um , whales ?
LINCOLN: We 've been chasing this whale for a long time . We 've finally placed a harpoon in the monster 's back . It 's in , James , it 's in ! We finish the deed now , we ca n't wait ! O with one flop of his tail he 'll smash the boat and send us all to eternity !
SEWARD: On the 31st of this month . Of this year . Put the amendment up for a vote . Ashley is agog .
BLUFF WADE: Whalers ?
JAMES ASHLEY: That 's what he said .
BLUFF WADE: The man 's never been near a whale ship in his life !
SCHUYLER COLFAX: I imagine we 'd rejoice to see that .
BLUFF WADE: He 's said he 'd welcome the South ack with all its slaves in chains .
JAMES ASHLEY: Three years ago he said that ! To calm the border states when we were-
THADDEUS STEVENS: I do n't .
SEWARD: The President is never to be mentioned . Nor I . You 're paid fo your discretion .
W.N. BILBO: Hell , you can have that fo nothin ' , what we need money for is ibes . It 'd speed things up .
SEWARD: No . Nothing strictly illegal .
ROBERT LATHAM: It 's not illegal to bribe Congressmen . They starve otherwise .
RICHARD SCHELL: I have explained to Mr. Bilbo and Mr. Latham that we 're offering patronage jobs to the Dems who vote yes . Jobs and nothing more .
SEWARD: That 's correct .
W.N. BILBO: Congressmen come cheap ! Few thousand bucks 'll buy you all you need .
SEWARD: The President would be unhappy to hear you did that .
W.N. BILBO: Well , will he be unhappy if we lose ?
SEWARD: The money I managed to raise fo this endeavor is only for you fees , food , and lodgings .
W.N. BILBO: Uh huh . If that squirrel-infested attic you 've quartered us in 's any measure , you ai n't raised much .
RICHARD SCHELL: Shall we get to work ? Bilbo takes a mallet to a crab , smashing it !
SCHUYLER COLFAX: The House recognizes Fernando Wood , the honorable representative from New York .
FERNANDO WOOD: Estimable colleagues . Two bloody years ago this month , his Highness , King Abraham Africanus the First - our Great Usurping Caesar , violato of habeas corpus and freedom of the press , abuser of states ' rights -
RICHARD SCHELL: Perhaps he 'll jump . Cheering and booing .
W.N. BILBO: Looks like he ate a bad oyster . Thaddeus Stevens calls out from his desk .
THADDEUS STEVENS: A point of order , Mr. Speaker , if you please ? When will Mr. Wood -
FERNANDO WOOD: Mr. Speaker , I still have the floo and the gentleman from Pennsylvania is out of order !
THADDEUS STEVENS: - when will Mr. Wood conclude his interminable gabble ? Some of us eathe oxygen , and we find the mephitic fumes of his oratory a lethal challenge to our pleural capacities . Wild cheering , applause from the Republicans .
FERNANDO WOOD: We shall oppose this amendment , and any legislation that so affronts natural law , insulting to God as to man ! Congress must never declare equal those whom God created unequal !
THADDEUS STEVENS: Slavery is the only insult to natural law , you fatuous nincompoop !
GEORGE PENDLETON: Order ! Procedure ! Mr. Speaker , Mr. Wood has the floor !
THADDEUS STEVENS: What violates natural law ? Slavery , and you , Pendleton , you insult God , you unnatural noise .
JAMES ASHLEY: Mr. Colfax ! Please , use your gavel ! They are - You are out of order !
TOM PENDEL: Please do n't encourage this ! Do n't encourage this !
TAD: You 're back you 're back you 're back you 're back you 're -
ROBERT: I am . Your goat got big .
PETITIONER: Please , please .
MARY: He 's here He 's here , Mrs. Cuthbert ! He 's here !
ROBERT: Hi , mama . Hey . Hey
OVERJOYED: Oh !
TAD: Mr. Nicolay says daddy 's secluded with Mr. Blair .
MARY: Tell him anyway .
ROBERT: No
MARY: You 'll linger a few days extra , after the reception , before you go ack to school .
ROBERT: Well , I do n't know if I 'm gon na go ack to - She stops him with an alarmed look .
MARY: We 'll fatten you up before you eturn to Boston .
ROBERT: All right , mama .
MARY: All right . ( beaming at him ,
PRESTON BLAIR: Jefferson Davis is sending three delegates Stephens , Hunter and Campbell Vice President of the Confederacy , their former Secretary of State , and their Assistant
LINCOLN: I intend to , Preston . And in eturn , I must ask you -
ROBERT: Thank you .
LINCOLN: ( dismissing Robert ,
PRESTON BLAIR: I will procure your votes for you , as I promised . You 've always kept your word to me . Those Southern men are coming . I beg you , in the name of Gentle
LINCOLN: I understand , Preston .
ROBERT LATHAM: - so the total of representatives voting three weeks from today is educed to 182 , which means 122 yes votes to reach the requisite two- thirds of the House . Assuming all Republicans vote for the amendment ?
W.N. BILBO: The kind that hates niggers , hates God for making niggers .
ROBERT LATHAM: The Good Lord on High would despai of their souls .
SEWARD: Thank you for that pithy explanation , Mr. Bilbo .
RICHARD SCHELL: We 've abandoned these 39 to the Devil that possesses them .
ROBERT LATHAM: Charles Hanson .
W.N. BILBO: Clay Hawkins . Of Ohio .
CLAY HAWKINS: T-tax collector for the Western Reserve . Th-th-that pays handsomely .
W.N. BILBO: Do n't just reach for the highest anches . They sway in every eeze . Assistant Port Inspector of Marlston looks like the ticket to me .
CLAY HAWKINS: Uh , boats , they , they make me sick .
SEWARD: And lastly , Democratic yes vote number six . Hawkins from Ohio .
LINCOLN: Six .
SEWARD: Well , thus far . Plus Graylor 's abstention . From tiny acorns and so on .
LINCOLN: What 'd Hawkins get ?
JOHN NICOLAY: Postmaster of the Millersburg Post Office .
LINCOLN: He 's selling himself cheap , ai n't he ?
SEWARD: He wanted tax collector of the Western Reserve - a first-term congressman who could n't manage re- election , I felt it unseemly and they bargained him down to Postmaster .
LINCOLN: Time for my public opinion bath . Might as well let ` em in .
SEWARD: One last item , an absurdity , but - My associates report that among the Representatives a fantastical umor 's bruited about , which I immediately disavowed , that you 'd allowed bleary old Preston Blair to sojourn to Richmond to invite Jeff Davis to send commissioners up to Washington with a peace plan .
ALEXANDER STEPHENS: Much obliged .
SEWARD: Why was n't I consulted ? ! I 'm Secretary of State ! You , you , you informally send a reactionary dottard , to - What will happen , do you imagine , when these peace commissioners arrive ?
LINCOLN: We 'll hear ` em out .
SEWARD: Oh , splendid ! And next the Democrats will invite ` em up to hearings on the Hill , and the newspapers - well , the newspapers - the newspapers will ask `` why risk enraging the Confederacy over the issue of slavery when they 're here to make peace ? '' We 'll lose every Democrat we 've got , more than likely conservative Republicans will join ` em , and all our work , all our preparing the ground fo the vote , laid waste , for naught .
LINCOLN: The Blairs have promised support for the amendment if we listen to these people -
SEWARD: Oh , the Blairs promise , do they ? You think they 'll keep thei promise once we have heard these delegates and refused them ? Which we will have to do , since thei proposal most certainly will be predicated on keeping their slaves !
LINCOLN: What hope for any Democratic votes , Willum , if word gets out that I 've efused a chance to end the war ? You think word wo n't get out ? In Washington ?
SEWARD: It 's either the amendment or this Confederate peace , you can not have oth .
LINCOLN: `` If you can look into the seeds of time , And say which grain will grow and which will not , Speak then to me ''
SEWARD: Oh , disaster . This is a disaster !
LINCOLN: Time is a great thickener of things , Willum .
SEWARD: Yes , I suppose it is - Actually I have no idea what you mean by that . Lincoln stands .
LINCOLN: Get me thirteen votes . ( in a thick Kentucky
LINCOLN: It 's a sturdy profession , and a useful one .
ROBERT: Yes , and I want to be useful , but now , not afterwards ! Slade hands Lincoln his formal gloves .
LINCOLN: I ai n't wearing them things , Mr. Slade , they never fit right .
WILLIAM SLADE: The missus will have you wear ` em . Do n't think about leaving ` em .
ROBERT: You 're delaying , that 's you favorite tactic .
LINCOLN: I 've found that prophesying is one of life 's less prophet-able occupations !
TAD: Why do some slaves cost more than others ?
ROBERT: If they 're still young and healthy , if the women can still conceive , they 'll pay more -
LINCOLN: Put ` em back in the box . We 'll eturn them to Mr. Gardner 's studio day after next . Be careful with ` em , now . These things should 've stayed on the calf .
TAD: ( to Slade , putting the
WILLIAM SLADE: I was born a free man . Nobody beat me except I beat them right back .
ELIZABETH KECKLEY: Mr. Lincoln , could you come with me-
WILLIAM SLADE: Mrs. Keckley was a slave . Ask he if she was beaten .
TAD LINCOLN: Were you - Tad .
ELIZABETH KECKLEY: I was beaten with a fire shovel when I was younger than you .
ROBERT: She never goes in there .
JOHN HAY: The reception line is already stretching out the door .
ROBERT: I 'll be the only man over fifteen and under sixty-five in this whole place not in uniform .
TAD: I 'm under fifteen and I have a uniform . Robert storms out .
MARY: My head hurts so .
BEAT: I prayed for death the night Willie died . The headaches are how I know I did n't get my wish . How to endure the long afternoon and deep into the night .
LINCOLN: I know .
MARY: Trying not to think about him . How will I manage ?
LINCOLN: Somehow you will .
MARY: Somehow . Somehow . Somehow Every party , every And now , four years more in this terrible house eproaching us . He was a very sick little boy . We should 've cancelled that reception , should n't we ?
LINCOLN: We did n't know how sick he was .
MARY: I knew , I knew , I saw that night he was dying .
LINCOLN: Three years ago , the war was going so badly , and we had to put on a face .
MARY: But I saw Willie was dying . I saw
LINCOLN: Molly . It 's too hard . Too hard .
WILLIAM SLADE: She 's just ten feet yonder . I 'd like to keep my job .
MARY: Senator Sumner , it has been much too long .
CHARLES SUMNER: `` Oh , who can look on that celestial face and - ''
MARY: And ?
JAMES ASHLEY: James Ashley , ma'am , we 've met several times - But she ignores him and greets Stevens .
MARY: Praise Heavens , praise Heavens , just when I had abandoned hope of amusement , it 's the Chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee ! Stevens bows to her .
THADDEUS STEVENS: Mrs. Lincoln .
MARY: Madame President if you please !
LAUGHS: Oh , do n't convene anothe subcommittee to investigate me , sir ! I 'm teasing ! Smile , Senato Wade .
BLUFF WADE: I believe I am smiling , Mrs. Lincoln .
MARY: I 'll take your word for that , sir !
THADDEUS STEVENS: As long as your household accounts are in order , Madame , we 'll have no need to investigate them .
MARY: You have always taken such a lively , even prosecutorial interest in my household accounts .
THADDEUS STEVENS: Your household accounts have always een so interesting .
MARY: Yes , thank you , it 's true , the miracles I have wrought out of fertilizer bills and cutlery invoices . But I had to ! Four years ago , when the President and I arrived , this was pure pigsty . Tobacco stains in the turkey carpets . Mushrooms , green as the moon , sprouting from ceilings ! And a pauper 's pittance allotted fo improvements . As if your committee joined with all of Washington awaiting , in what you anticipated would be our comfort in squalor , further proof that my husband and I were prairie primitives , unsuited to the position to which an erro of the people , a flaw in the democratic process , had elevated us .
ROBERT: Mother ?
MARY: What ?
ROBERT: You 're creating a bottleneck .
MARY: Oh !
LINCOLN: Since we have the floor next in the debate , I thought I 'd suggest you mighttemper your contributions so as not to frighten ou conservative friends ?
THADDEUS STEVENS: Ashley insists you 're ensuring approval by dispensing patronage to otherwise undeserving Democrats .
LINCOLN: I ca n't ensure a single damn thing if you scare the whole House with talk of land appropriations and evolutionary tribunals and punitive thisses and thats -
THADDEUS STEVENS: When the war ends , I intend to push for full equality , the Negro vote and much more . Congress shall mandate the seizure of every foot of rebel land and every dollar of their property . We 'll use thei confiscated wealth to establish hundreds of thousands of free Negro farmers , and at their side soldiers armed to occupy and transform the heritage of traitors . We 'll build up a land down there of free men and free women and free children and freedom . The nation needs to know that we have such plans .
LINCOLN: That 's the untempered version of econstruction . It 's not It 's not exactly what I intend , but we shall oppose one another in the course of time . Now we 're working together , and I 'm asking you -
THADDEUS STEVENS: For patience , I expect .
LINCOLN: When the people disagree , bringing them together requires going slow till they 're ready to make up -
THADDEUS STEVENS: Ah , shit on the people and what they want and what they 're ready for ! I do n't give a goddamn about the people and what they want ! This is the face of someone who has fought long and hard for the good of the people without caring much for any of ` em . And I look a lot worse without the wig . The people elected me ! To represent them ! To lead them ! And I lead ! You ought to try it !
LINCOLN: I admire your zeal , Mr. Stevens , and I have tried to profit from the example of it . But if I 'd listened to you , I'd 've declared every slave free the minute the first shell struck Fort Sumter ; then the borde states would 've gone over to the confederacy , the war would 've been lost and the Union along with it , and instead of abolishing slavery , as we hope to do , in two weeks , we 'd be watching helpless as infants as it spread from the American South into South America . Stevens glares at him , then smiles .
THADDEUS STEVENS: Oh , how you have longed to say that to me . You claim you trust them - ut you know what the people are . You know that the inner compass that should direct the soul toward justice has ossified in white men and women , north and south , unto utter uselessness through tolerating the evil of slavery . White people can not bear the thought of sharing this country 's infinite abundance with Negroes .
LINCOLN: A compass , I learnt when I was surveying , it 'll - it 'll point you True North from where you 're standing , but it 's got no advice
MARY: Make time to talk to Robbie . You only have time for Tad .
LINCOLN: Tad 's young .
MARY: So 's Robert . Too young for the army .
LINCOLN: Plenty of boys younger than Robert signing up
MARY: Do n't take Robbie . Do n't let me lose my son .
JOHN NICOLAY: Secretary Stanton has sent over to tell you that as of half an hou ago , the shelling of Wilmington harbor has commenced .
STANTON: They can not possibly maintain unde this kind of an assault . Terry 's got ten thousand men surrounding the Goddamned fort ! Why does n't he answer my cables ?
STANTON: No ! No , you 're , you 're going to tell a story ! I do n't believe that I can bear to listen to another one of your stories right now !
LINCOLN: It was right after the Revolution , ight after peace had been concluded , and Ethan Allen went to London to help our new country conduct its business with the king . The English sneered at how rough we are , and rude and simple-minded and on like that , everywhere he went , till one day he was invited to the townhouse of a great English lord . Dinner was served , beverages imbibed , time passed , as happens , and Mr. Allen found he needed the
CHARLES BENJAMIN: Fort Fisher is ours . We 've taken the port .
WELLES: And Wilmington ?
MAJOR ECKERT: We 've taken the fort , but the city of Wilmington has not surrendered . A beat as this sinks in . Then
STANTON: How many casualties ?
FERNANDO WOOD: Heavy losses .
GEORGE PENDLETON: And more to come .
FERNANDO WOOD: Sours the national mood . That might suffice to discourage him -
GEORGE PENDLETON: To what ? To bring this down ? Not in a fight like this . This is to the death .
FERNANDO WOOD: It 's gruesome !
GEORGE PENDLETON: Are you despairing , or merely lazy ? This fight is for The United States of America ! Nothing `` suffices '' . A umor ? Nothing ! They 're not lazy ! They 're busily buying votes ! While we hope to be saved by `` the national mood ? ! ''
FERNANDO WOOD: George , please . Stay on course .
GEORGE PENDLETON: Bring Stevens to full froth . I can ensure that every newspaperman from Louisville to San Francisco will be here to witness it and print it .
SCHUYLER COLFAX: The floor belongs to the mellifluent gentleman from Kentucky , Mr. George Yeaman .
GEORGE YEAMAN: I thank you , Speaker Colfax .
RICHARD SCHELL: Think how splendid if Mr. Yeaman switched .
ROBERT LATHAM: Too publicly against us . He ca n't change course now .
W.N. BILBO: Not for some miserable little jo anyways .
GEORGE YEAMAN: And , and ! We will be forced to enfranchise the men of the colored ace - it would be inhuman not to ! Who among us is prepared to give Negroes the vote ?
FERNANDO WOOD: Bless my eyes , if it is n't the Post Master of Millersburg Ohio !
GEORGE PENDLETON: Mr. LeClerk felt honor-bound to inform us . Of your disgusting etrayal . Your prostitution .
FERNANDO WOOD: Is that true , Postmaster Hawkins ? Is your maidenly virtue for sale ? Hawkins sinks .
CLAY HAWKINS: My neighbors hear that I voted yes for nigger freedom and no to peace , they will kill me .
W.N. BILBO: A deal 's a deal and you men know etter than to piss your pants just cause there 's talk about peace talks .
CLAY HAWKINS: I want to do right ! But I got no courage ! ! ! Hawkins runs away , sobbing . Bilbo pursues .
W.N. BILBO: Wait ! ! You wanted , what was it , tax man for the Western Reserve , hell you can have the whole state of Ohio if you - Bilbo stops , winded .
SEWARD: Eleven votes ? ! Two days ago we had twelve ! ! What happened ?
RICHARD SCHELL: They are ruining us .
W.N. BILBO: Resistance , hell ! Thingamabo Hollister , Dem from Indiana ? I approached him , the sumbitch nea to murdered me !
SEWARD: Perhaps you push too hard .
W.N. BILBO: I push nobody . Perhaps we need einforcements . If Jeff Davis wants to cease hostilities , who do you think 'll give a genuine solid shit to free slaves ?
SEWARD: Get back to it , and good day , gentlemen . Schell and Latham lean in to the carriage .
RICHARD SCHELL: We are at an impasse .
ROBERT LATHAM: Tell Lincoln to deny the rumors . Publicly .
RICHARD SCHELL: Tell us what you expect of us .
SEWARD: I expect you to do your work ! And to have sufficient sense and taste not to presume to instruct the President . Or me . Schell steps up on the running board , intent .
RICHARD SCHELL: Is there a Confederate offer o not ?
GRANT: I suggest you work some changes to your proposal before you give it to the President .
R.M.T HUNTER: We 're eager to be on our way to Washington .
ALEXANDER STEPHENS: Did Mr. Lincoln tell you to tell us this , General Grant ?
GRANT: It says '' securing peace for ou two countries . '' And it goes on like that .
ALEXANDER STEPHENS: I do n't know what you -
GRANT: There 's just one country . You and I , we 're citizens of that country . I 'm fighting to protect it from armed rebels . From you .
ALEXANDER STEPHENS: But Mr. Blair told us , he , he told President Davis we were -
GRANT: A private citizen like Preston Blair can say what he pleases , since he has no authority ove anything . If you want to discuss peace with President Lincoln , consider revisions . He lights a cigar .
ALEXANDER STEPHENS: If we 're not to discuss a truce etween warring nations , what in heaven 's name can we discuss ?
GRANT: Terms of surrender .
SEWARD: `` will have a bad influence . I will be sorry should it prove impossible for you to have an interview with them . I am awaiting your instructions . U.S. Grant , Lieutenant General Commanding Armies United States ''
LINCOLN: After four years of war and nea 600,000 lives lost . He believes we can end this war now . My trust in him is marrow deep .
SEWARD: You could bring the delegates to Washington . In exchange for the South 's immediate surrender , we could promise them the amendment 's defeat . They 'd agree , do n't you think ? We 'd end the war . This week . Lincoln has closed his eyes .
LINCOLN: Now , here 's a sixteen year old boy . They 're going to hang him
JOHN HAY: Ummm I do n't know , sir , I do n't know who you 're , uh What time is it ?
LINCOLN: It 's three forty in the morning .
JOHN NICOLAY: Do n't let him pardon any more deserters Nicolay 's asleep again .
JOHN HAY: Mr. Stanton thinks you pardon too many . He 's generally apoplectic on the subject -
LINCOLN: He ought n't to have done that , crippled his horse , that was cruel , ut you do n't just hang a sixteen year old boy for that -
JOHN HAY: Ask the horse what he thinks .
LINCOLN: - for cruelty . There 'd be no sixteen year old boys left . Grant wants me to bring the secesh delegates to Washington .
JOHN HAY: So There are secesh delegates ?
LINCOLN: He was afraid , that 's all it was . I do n't care to hang a boy fo eing frightened , either . What good would it do him ?
JOHN HAY: Do you need company ?
LINCOLN: `` Lieutenant General Ulysses S. Grant , City Point . I have read you words with interest . ''
ANOTHER PAUSE: `` A . Lincoln . '' And the date .
SAMUEL BECKWITH: Yes sir . Lincoln places the hat on the floor .
LINCOLN: You think we choose to be born ?
SAMUEL BECKWITH: I do n't suppose so .
LINCOLN: Are we fitted to the times we 're orn into ?
SAMUEL BECKWITH: I do n't know about myself . You may e , sir . Fitted .
LINCOLN: What do you reckon ?
HOMER BATES: I 'm an engineer . I reckon there 's machinery but no one 's done the fitting .
LINCOLN: You 're an engineer , you must know Euclid 's axioms and common notions .
HOMER BATES: I must 've in school , but
LINCOLN: I never had much of schooling , but I read Euclid , in an old book I orrowed . Little enough ever found its way in here - - but once learnt it stayed learnt .
A BEAT: D'you see ? There it is , even in that two-thousand year old book of mechanical law it is a self- evident truth that things which are equal to the same thing are equal to each other . We begin with equality . That 's the origin , is n't it ? That balance , that 's fairness , that 's justice .
SAMUEL BECKWITH: `` Have Captain Saunders convey the commissioners to me here in Washington . ''
LINCOLN: A slight emendation , Sam , if you would . Beckwith writes as Lincoln dictates .
BEAT: `` further advice from me . Do not proceed to Washington . ''
SCHUYLER COLFAX: The World , the Herald and the Times , New York , Chicago , the Journal of Commerce , even you hometown paper 's here .
JAMES ASHLEY: Say you believe only in legal equality for all races , not racial equality , I beg you , sir . Compromise . Or you risk it all .
FERNANDO WOOD: I 've asked you a question , Mr. Stevens , and you must answer me . Do you or do you not hold that the precept that `` all men are created equal '' is meant literally ?
THADDEUS STEVENS: The true purpose of the amendment , Mr. Wood , you perfectly-named , ainless , obstructive object ?
FERNANDO WOOD: You have always insisted , Mr. Stevens , that Negroes are the same as white men are .
THADDEUS STEVENS: The true purpose of the amendment -
FERNANDO WOOD: That 's not so ! You believe that Negroes are entirely equal to white men . You 've said it a thousand
GEORGE PENDLETON: For shame ! For shame ! Stop prevaricating and answe Representative Wood !
JAMES ASHLEY: He 's answered your questions ! This amendment has naught to do with ace equality !
MARY: ( whispering to Mrs .
GEORGE PENDLETON: Your frantic attempt to delude us now is unworthy of a epresentative . It is , in fact , unworthy of a white man !
THADDEUS STEVENS: How can I hold that all men are created equal , when here before me - - stands stinking the moral carcass of the gentleman from Ohio , proof that some men are inferior , endowed y their Maker with dim wits impermeable to reason with cold pallid slime in their veins instead of hot red blood ! You are more eptile than man , George , so low and flat that the foot of man is incapable of crushing you ! General uproar .
GEORGE PENDLETON: HOW DARE YOU !
THADDEUS STEVENS: Yet even you , Pendleton , who should have been gibbetted for treason long before today , even worthless unworthy you ought to be treated equally before the law ! And so again , sir , and again and again and
THADDEUS STEVENS: I 'm sorry you 're nauseous , Asa , that must be unpleasant . I want the amendment to pass . So that the Constitution 's first and only mention of slavery is its absolute prohibition . For this amendment , for which I have worked all of my life and for which
ROBERT: I 'm not going in .
LINCOLN: You said you wanted to help me .
ROBERT: This is - This is just a clumsy attempt at discouragement . I 've een to army hospitals , I 've seen surgeries , I went and visited the malaria barges with mama .
LINCOLN: She told me she did n't take you inside .
ROBERT: I snuck in after - I 've seen what it 's like . This changes nothing .
LINCOLN: At all rates , I 'm happy to have your company .
ARMY SURGEON: Hello , Mr. President .
LINCOLN: Good to see you again .
FIRST PATIENT: Hello , sir .
LINCOLN: What 's your name , soldier ?
FIRST PATIENT: Robert .
LINCOLN: Robert . Good to meet you , Robert .
SECOND PATIENT: Nice to meet you .
LINCOLN: What 's your name ?
SECOND PATIENT: Kevin .
LINCOLN: Tell me your names as I go past . I like to know who I 'm talkin ' to . Kevin .
THIRD PATIENT: Mr. President . John .
LINCOLN: John . I 've seen you before .
FOURTH PATIENT: Mr. President
ROBERT: I have to do this ! And I will do it and I do n't need your permission to enlist .
LINCOLN: That same speech has been made by how many sons to how many fathers since the war began ? `` I do n't need your damn permission , you miserable old goat , I 'm gon na enlist anyhow ! '' And what would n't those numberless fathers have given to be able to say to their sons - as I now say to mine - `` I 'm commander-in-chief , so in point of fact , without my permission , you ai n't enlisting in nothing , nowhere , young man . ''
ROBERT: It 's mama you 're scared of , not me getting killed .
LINCOLN: We ca n't lose you .
MARY: The war will take our son ! A sniper , or a shrapnel shell ! O typhus , same as took Willie , it takes hundreds of boys a day ! He 'll die , uselessly , and how will I eve forgive you ? Most men , thei firstborn is their favorite , but you , you 've always blamed Robert for being born , for trapping you in a marriage that 's only ever given you grief and caused you regret !
LINCOLN: That 's not true -
MARY: And if the slaughter of Cold Harbo is on your hands same as Grant , God help us ! We 'll pay for the oceans of spilled blood you 've sanctioned , the uncountable corpses we 'll be made to pay with our son 's dea
LINCOLN: Just , just this once , Mrs. Lincoln , I demand of you to try and take the liberal and not the selfish point of view ! You imagine Robert will forgive us if we continue to stifle his very natural ambition ? !
MARY: And if I refuse to take the high oad , if I wo n't take up the rough old cross , will you threaten me again with the madhouse , as you did when I could n't stop crying ove Willie , when I showed you what heartbreak , real heartbreak looked like , and you had n't the courage to countenance it , to help me -
LINCOLN MARY: That 's right . When you I was in the room with
LINCOLN: I could n't tolerate you grieving so for Willie because I could n't permit it in myself , though I wanted to , Mary . I wanted to crawl under the earth , into the vault with his coffin . I still do . Every day I do . Do n't talk to me about grief .
MARY: You think I 'm ignorant of what you 're up to because you have n't discussed this scheme with me as you ought to have done . When have I ever been so easily bamboozled ?
BEAT: I believe you when you insist that amending the constitution and abolishing slavery will end this war . And since you are sending my son into the war , woe unto you if you fail to pass the amendment .
LINCOLN: Seward does n't want me leaving big muddy footprints all over town .
MARY: No one ever lived who knows bette than you the proper placement of footfalls on treacherous paths . Seward ca n't do it . You must . Because if you fail to secure the necessary votes , woe unto you , sir . You will answer to me .
ELIZABETH KECKLEY: I know the vote is only four days away ; I know you 're concerned . Thank you for your concern ove this , and I want you to know They 'll approve it . God will see to it .
LINCOLN: I do n't envy him his task . He may wish He 'd chosen an instrument fo His purpose more wieldy than the House of Representatives .
ELIZABETH KECKLEY: Then you 'll see to it .
LINCOLN: Are you afraid of what lies ahead ? For your people ? If we succeed ?
ELIZABETH KECKLEY: White people do n't want us here .
LINCOLN: Many do n't .
ELIZABETH KECKLEY: What about you ?
LINCOLN: II do n't know you , Mrs. Keckley . Any of you . You 're familiar to me , as all people are . Unaccommodated , poor , bare , forked creatures such as we all are . You have a right to expect what I expect , and likely our expectations are not incomprehensible to each other . I assume I 'll get used to you . But what you are to the nation , what 'll become of you once slavery 's day is done , I do n't know .
ELIZABETH KECKLEY: What my people are to be , I ca n't say . Negroes have been fighting and dying for freedom since the first of us was a slave . I never heard any ask what freedom will bring . Freedom 's first . As for me My son died , fighting for the Union , wearing the Union blue . For freedom he died . I 'm his mother . That 's what I am to the nation , Mr. Lincoln . What else must I be ?
W.N. BILBO: My whole hand 's gon na be proud in about five seconds , let 's see how proud you gon na be .
ROBERT LATHAM: Oh , it is ? What you got goin ' ? There 's a quick knock on the door .
W.N. BILBO: Yeah ?
ROBERT LATHAM: Go away !
TO BILBO: That watch fob , is that gold ?
W.N. BILBO: You keep your eyes off my fob !
ROBERT LATHAM: Nines paired !
W.N. BILBO: Oh my God damn !
SEWARD: Gentlemen . You have a visitor .
W.N. BILBO: Well , I 'll be fucked .
LINCOLN: I would n't bet against it , Mr ?
W.N. BILBO: W.N . Bilbo .
LINCOLN: Mr. Bilbo . Gentlemen .
ROBERT LATHAM: Sir
W.N. BILBO: Why are you here ? No offense , but Mr. Seward 's banished the very mention of your name , he wo n't even
LINCOLN: The Secretary of State here tells me that , uh , you got eleven Democrats in the bag . That 's encouraging .
ROBERT LATHAM: Oh , you 've got no cause to be encouraged . Sir . Uh
RICHARD SCHELL: Are we beingfired ? Lincoln sits at the card table .
LINCOLN: `` We have heard the chimes of midnight , Master Shallow . '' I 'm here to alert you boys that the great day of reckoning is nigh upon us .
RICHARD SCHELL: The Democrats we 've yet to bag , sir . The patronage jobs simply wo n't bag ` em . They require moreconvincing , Mr. President . Lincoln nods . He turns to Bilbo .
LINCOLN: Mm-hmm . Do me a favor , willya ?
W.N. BILBO: Sure .
LINCOLN: Snagged my eye in the paper this morning . Governor Curtin is set to declare a winner in the disputed Congressional election for the -
W.N. BILBO: Pennsylvania 16th District .
LINCOLN: What a joy to be comprehended . Hop on a train to Philadell , call on the Governor -
SEWARD: ( looking askance at
LINCOLN: No , he 'll do fine , just polish yourself up first . Bilbo , cigar back in mouth , laughs .
ROBERT LATHAM: The incumbent is claiming he won it . Name of , uh
W.N. BILBO: Coffroth .
LINCOLN: That 's him .
RICHARD SCHELL: Coffroth . He is a Democrat .
SEWARD: Pity poor Coffroth .
THADDEUS STEVENS: It opens !
ALEXANDER COFFROTH: Coffroth , Mr. Stevens , Alexande Coffroth , I 'm , I 'm -
THADDEUS STEVENS: Are we representatives of the same state ?
ALEXANDER COFFROTH: Y-yes sir ! We sit only three desks
THADDEUS STEVENS: I have n't noticed you . I 'm a Republican , and you , Coughdrop , are a Democrat ?
ALEXANDER COFFROTH: Well , I Um , that is to say I -
THADDEUS STEVENS: The modern travesty of Thomas Jefferson 's political organization to which you have attached yourself like a barnacle has the effrontery to call itself The Democratic Party . You are a Dem-o-crat . What 's the matter with you ? Are you wicked ?
ALEXANDER COFFROTH: Well , I felt , um , formerly , I -
THADDEUS STEVENS: Never mind , Coffsnot . You were ignominiously trounced at the hustings in November 's election by your worthy challenger , a
ALEXANDER COFFROTH: No , sir , I was not , um , trounced ! Uh , he wants to steal my seat ! I did n't lose the election -
THADDEUS STEVENS: What difference does it make if you lost or not ? ! The governor of ou state , is ? A Democrat ?
ALEXANDER COFFROTH: No , he 's a A , um , a Ruh
THADDEUS STEVENS: Re .
ALEXANDER COFFROTH: Re .
THADDEUS STEVENS: Pub .
ALEXANDER COFFROTH: Pub .
THADDEUS STEVENS: Li .
ALEXANDER COFFROTH: Li .
THADDEUS STEVENS: Can .
ALEXANDER COFFROTH: Can . Republican .
THADDEUS STEVENS: I know what he is . This is a hetorical exercise . And Congress is controlled by what party ? Yours ?
ALEXANDER COFFROTH: I know what I must do , sir ! I will immediately become a Republican and vote yes for -
THADDEUS STEVENS: NO ! Coffroth will vote yes but Coffroth will remain a Democrat until after he does so .
ALEXANDER COFFROTH: Why wait to switch ? I 'm happy to
THADDEUS STEVENS: We want to show the amendment has ipartisan support , you idiot . Early in the next Congress , when I tell you to do so , you will switch parties . Now congratulations on your victory , and get out .
LINCOLN: Now give me the names of whoeve else you been hunting .
ROBERT LATHAM: George Yeaman .
RICHARD SCHELL: Yes . Yeaman .
W.N. BILBO: Among others . But Yeaman That 'd count .
ROBERT LATHAM: Y-E-A-M-A-N
LINCOLN: I got it .
ROBERT LATHAM: Kentucky .
GEORGE YEAMAN: I ca n't vote for the amendment , Mr. Lincoln .
LINCOLN: I saw a barge once , Mr. Yeaman , filled with colored men in chains , heading down the Mississippi to the New Orleans slave markets . It sickened me , ` n more than that , it ought a shadow down , a pall around my eyes .
BEAT: Slavery troubled me , as long as I can remember , in a way it neve troubled my father , though he hated it . In his own fashion . He knew no smallholding dirt farmer could compete with slave plantations . He took us out from Kentucky to get away from ` em . He wanted Indiana kept free . He was n't a kind man , ut there was a rough moral urge for fairness , for freedom in him . I learnt that from him , I suppose , if little else from him . We did n't care for one another , Mr. Yeaman .
GEORGE YEAMAN: I Well , I 'm sorry to hear that -
LINCOLN: Lovingkindness , that most ordinary thing , came to me from othe sources . I 'm grateful for that .
GEORGE YEAMAN: I hate it , too , sir , slavery , but - ut we 're entirely unready fo emancipation . There 's too many
LINCOLN: We 're unready for peace too , ai n't we ? When it comes , it 'll present us with conundrums and dangers greate than any we 've faced during the war , bloody as it 's been . We 'll have to extemporize and experiment with what it is when it is .
GEORGE YEAMAN: No , no , but , but , but - But Negroes ca n't , um , vote , Mr. Lincoln . You 're not suggesting that we enfranchise colored people .
LINCOLN: I 'm asking only that you disenthrall yourself from the slave powers . I 'll let you know when there 's an offer on my desk fo surrender . There 's none before us now . What 's efore us now , that 's the vote on the Thirteenth Amendment . It 's going to be so very close . You see what you can do . Lincoln leaves Yeaman , considering .
WILLIAM HUTTON: I ca n't make sense of it , what he died for . Mr. Lincoln , I hate them all , I do , all black people . I am a prejudiced man .
LINCOLN: I 'd change that in you if I could , ut that 's not why I come . I might e wrong , Mr. Hutton , but I expect Colored people will most likely be free , and when that 's so , it 's simple truth that you other 's bravery , and his death , helped make it so . Only you can decide whether that 's sense enough for you , or not . Hutton walks slowly back to his house .
PRESTON BLAIR: We 've managed our members to a fare- thee-well , you 've had no defections from the Republican right to trouble you , whereas as to what you promised - Where the hell are the commissioners ? !
JAMES ASHLEY: Oh God
LINCOLN: I ca n't listen to this anymore ! I ca n't accomplish a goddamned thing of any human meaning or worth until we cure ourselves of slavery and end this pestilential war , and whether any of you or anyone else knows it , I know I need this ! This amendment is that cure ! We 're stepped out upon the world 's stage now , now , with the fate of human dignity in our hands ! Blood 's been spilt to afford us this moment !
SEWARD: We need two yeses , three abstentions , or four yeses and one more abstention and the amendment will pass -
LINCOLN: You got a night and a day and a night and several perfectly good hours ! Now get the hell out of here and get ` em !
JAMES ASHLEY: Yes but how ?
LINCOLN: Buzzards ' guts , man .
SCHUYLER COLFAX: Mr. Ashley , the floor is yours .
JAMES ASHLEY: On the matter of the joint esolution before us , presenting a Thirteenth Amendment to ou national Constitution , which was passed last year by the Senate , and which has been debated now by this estimable body for the past several weeks . Today we will vote Cheers , boos , applause .
GEORGE PENDLETON: I 've just received confirmation of what previously has been merely umored ! Affidavits from loyal citizens recently returned from
FERNANDO WOOD: Are there Confederate commissioners in the Capitol ?
JAMES ASHLEY: I do n't I have no idea where they are or if they 've arrived or -
FERNANDO WOOD: If they 've arrived ? !
GEORGE PENDLETON: I appeal to my fellow Democrats , to all Republican representatives who give a fig for peace ! Postpone this vote until we have answers from the President himself !
FERNANDO WOOD: Postpone the vote !
AARON HADDAM: Gentlemen . The conservative faction of borde and western Republicans can not approve this amendment , about which we harbor grave doubts , if a peace offer is being held hostage to its success . Joining with ou Democratic colleagues , I second the motion to postpone .
ROBERT LATHAM: Quick , man ! Quick !
LINCOLN: This is precisely what Mr. Wood wishes me to respond to ?
W.N. BILBO: Yes sir .
LINCOLN: Give this to Mr. Ashley .
JOHN HAY: I feel , um , I have to say , Mr. Lincoln , that this - ( annoyed , impatient , to
W.N. BILBO: You gon na have a chat now , with with the whole of the House of Representatives waiting on that ?
JOHN HAY: Making false representation to Congress is , it 's , um -
JOHN NICOLAY: It 's , it 's -
LINCOLN: Impeachable . I 've made no false epresentation .
JOHN HAY: But there are -
LINCOLN: Give me the note , Johnnie .
JAMES ASHLEY: From the President The chamber falls silent .
GEORGE PENDLETON: `` So far as I know- '' ? ! That means nothing ! Are there commissioners from the South or are n't there ? ! In the balcony , Mary looks to Mrs. Keckley .
JAMES ASHLEY: The President has answered you , sir ! Your peace offer is a fiction !
GEORGE PENDLETON: That is not a denial , it is a lawyer 's dodge !
JAMES ASHLEY: Mr. Haddam ? Is your faction satisfied ?
AARON HADDAM: The conservative Republican faction 's satisfied , and we thank Mr. Lincoln . I move to table Mr. Wood 's motion .
SCHUYLER COLFAX: Tabled !
JAMES ASHLEY: Speaker Colfax , I order the main question .
SCHUYLER COLFAX: A motion has been made to bring the ill for the Thirteenth Amendment to a vote . Do I hear a second ?
AUGUSTUS BENJAMIN: Nay ! The clerk records his vote .
ARTHUR BENTLEIGH: Nay !
JOHN ELLIS: Aye !
DEMOCRATIC SENATOR: What ? ! Shameful !
WALTER APPLETON: I vote no !
JOSIAH BURTON: Beanpole Burton is pleased to vote yea !
NEHEMIAH CLEARY: No .
JAMES ASHLEY: Mr. Martinson has delegated me to say he is indisposed and he abstains .
HAROLD HOLLISTER: No .
WILLIAM HUTTON: William Hutton , remembering at this moment his beloved brother , Fredrick , votes against the amendment .
SOLDIER: Webster Allen votes no . The cipher operator instantly transmits .
SERGEANT: Webster Allen , Illinois , Democrat , votesno . The cipher key clicks again .
GEORGE YEAMAN: I said aye , Mr. McPherson .
FERNANDO WOOD: TRAITOR ! TRAITOR !
SCHUYLER COLFAX: Order !
CLAY HAWKINS: Goddamn it , I 'm voting yes .
EDWIN LECLERK: No . Oh to hell with it , shoot me dead too . Yes !
ALEXANDER COFFROTH: ( proud of himself and happy about the reward
SERGEANT: James Brooksnay .
MEYER STRAUS: Nay .
JOSEPH MARSTERN: Nay .
HOWARD GUILEFOYLE: Yea .
AVON HANREADY: Nay .
RUFUS WARREN: Yea .
SCHUYLER COLFAX: Mr . Clerk , please call my name , I want to cast a vote .
GEORGE PENDLETON: I object ! The Speaker does n't vote !
SCHUYLER COLFAX: The Speaker may vote if he so chooses .
GEORGE PENDLETON: It is highly unusual , sir -
SCHUYLER COLFAX: This is n't usual , Mr. Pendleton , this is history .
THADDEUS STEVENS: The bill , Mr. McPherson , may I ?
LYDIA SMITH: I wish I 'd been .
THADDEUS STEVENS: It was a spectacle .
LYDIA SMITH: You ca n't bring your housekeeper to the House . I wo n't give them gossip .
THE PAPER: This is enough . This is It 's more than enough for now . They kiss . He lies back . He grabs her hand .
THADDEUS STEVENS: Read it to me again , my love .
LYDIA SMITH: `` PROPOSED - ''
THADDEUS STEVENS: And adopted .
LYDIA SMITH: Adopted . `` An Amendment to the Constitution of the United States . Section One Neither slavery no involuntary servitude , except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted , shall exist within the United States , or any place subject to their jurisdiction . ''
THADDEUS STEVENS: SECTION TWO
LYDIA SMITH: `` Congress shall have power to enforce this amendment by appropriate legislation . ''
ALEXANDER STEPHENS: Let me be blunt . Will the southern states resume their former position in the Union speedily enough to enable us to block ratification of the Thirteenth Amendment ?
LINCOLN: I 'd like peace immediately .
ALEXANDER STEPHENS: Yes , and ?
LINCOLN: I 'd like your states restored to their practical relations to the Union immediately . Silence .
ALEXANDER STEPHENS: If this could be given me in writing , as Vice President of the Confederacy , I 'd bring that document with celerity to Jefferson Davis .
SEWARD: Surrender and we can discuss econstruction .
ALEXANDER STEPHENS: Surrender wo n't be thought of unless you 've assured us , in writing , that we 'll be readmitted in time to block this amendment .
R.M.T. HUNTER: This is the arrogant demand of a conqueror for a humiliating ,
SEWARD: You 'll not be conquered people , Mr. Hunter . You will be citizens , eturned to the laws and the guarantees of rights of the Constitution .
ALEXANDER STEPHENS: Which now extinguishes slavery . And with it our economy . All our laws will be determined by a Congress of vengeful Yankees , all our rights 'll e subject to a Supreme Court enched by Black Republican adicals . All our traditions will e obliterated . We wo n't know ourselves anymore .
LINCOLN: We ai n't here to discuss econstruction , we have no legal asis for that discussion . But I do n't want to deal falsely . The Northern states 'll ratify , most of ` em . As I figure , it remains fo two of the Southern states to do the same , even after all are eadmitted . And I been working on that .
ALEXANDER STEPHENS: Tennessee and Louisiana .
LINCOLN: Arkansas too , most likely . It 'll be atified . Slavery , sir , it 's done . Hunter storms out of the cabin .
ALEXANDER STEPHENS: How 've you held your Union together ? Through democracy ? How many hundreds of thousands have died during your administration ? Your Union , sir , is bonded in cannonfire and death .
LINCOLN: It may be you 're right . But say all we done is show the world that democracy is n't chaos , that there is a great invisible strength in a people 's union ? Say we 've shown that a people can endure awful sacrifice and yet cohere ? Might n't that save at least the idea of democracy , to aspire to ? Eventually , to become worthy of ? At all rates , whatever may be proven y blood and sacrifice must 've been proved by now . Shall we stop this leeding ?
LINCOLN: Once he surrenders , send his boys ack to their homes , their farms , their shops .
GRANT: Yes sir , as we discussed .
LINCOLN: Liberality all around . No punishment . I do n't want that . And the leaders - Jeff and the rest of ` em - if they escape , leave the country while my back 's turned , that would n't upset me none .
GRANT: By outward appearance , you 're ten years older than you were a yea ago .
LINCOLN: Some weariness has bit at my bones .
BEAT: I never seen the like of it before . What I seen today . Never seen the like of it before .
GRANT: You always knew that , what this was going to be . Intimate , and ugly . You must 've needed to see it close when you decided to come down here .
LINCOLN: We 've made it possible for one another to do terrible things .
GRANT: And we 've won the war . Now you have to lead us out of it .
MARY: You 've an itch to travel ?
LINCOLN: I 'd like that . To the West by rail .
MARY: Overseas .
LINCOLN: The Holy Land .
MARY: Awfully pious for a man who takes his wife out buggy-riding on Good Friday .
LINCOLN: Jerusalem . Where David and Solomon walked . I dream of walking in that ancient city . She seems sadder . They ride in silence .
MARY: All anyone will remember of me is I was crazy and I ruined you happiness .
LINCOLN: Anyone thinks that does n't understand , Molly . She nods ; then , tenderly
MARY: When they look at you , at what it cost to live at the heart of this , they 'll wonder at it . They 'll wonder at you . They should . But they should also look at the wretched woman by your side , if they want to understand what this was truly like . For an ordinary person . For anyone other than you .
LINCOLN: We must try to be happier . We must . Both of us . We 've been so miserable for so long .
JAMES ASHLEY: Mr. Stevens is furious , he wants to know why you qualified it -
SCHUYLER COLFAX: No one heard the intelligent or the educated part . All they heard was the first time any president has ever made mention of Negro voting .
LINCOLN: Still , I wish I 'd mentioned it in a etter speech .
JAMES ASHLEY: Mr. Stevens also wants to know why you did n't make a better speech .
JOHN NICOLAY: Mrs. Lincoln 's waiting in the carriage . She wants me to remind you of the hour , and that you 'll have to pick up Miss Harris and Major Rathbone .
LINCOLN: Am I in trouble ?
WILLIAM SLADE: No , sir .
LINCOLN: Thank you , Mr. Slade .
LEONARD GROVER: The President has been shot .
DR. BARNES: It 's 7 22 in the morning , Saturday the 15th of April . It 's all over . The President is no more . No one talks , or moves . Stanton looks at Lincoln 's body .
STANTON: Now he belongs to the ages . Robert begins to weep .
LINCOLN: Yet , if God wills that it continue until all the wealth piled by the ondman 's two hundred and fifty years of unrequited toil shall be sunk , and until every drop of blood drawn with the lash shall be paid y another drawn with the sword , as was said three thousand years ago , so still it must be said `` the judgments of the Lord are true and ighteous altogether .

JUDGE ORTON: I 'm holding this over pending notification from counsel
HAROLD: That was bullshit , askin ' for a delay I know what that was about .
MICK: And so does Judge Powell . He spent a lot of years as a defense lawyer , so he knows all about having to chase `` Mr. Green , '' and he does n't look kindly on defendants who do n't pay their attorneys . Now do you get it , Harold ?

MICK: Good . Then I can go to County lock- up .
LORNA: You 're going to see Gloria . Why do you waste time on her , Mickey ?
EARL: Want me to do somethin ' about this ? 'Cause I can .
MICK: Ignore them , you 're doing fine .
LORNA: The divorce papers called it temporary insanity .
MICK: Lucky for you there was a cure . When Earl interrupts , insistent now
EARL: Mr. Haller ?
EDDIE: Counsellor , how 's it hanging ?
MICK: Fine , Eddie , how 's it with you ?
CASUAL: Hard Case called me from the pen , he said I might catch up to you . Said you 're stalling his case til you see more green , is that right ?
MICK: If you want me to work you 've gat to pay me .
EDDIE: We paid you . Five thousand .
MICK: That 's long gone . I could tell you half went to the aerial-photo expert . He 's going to blow the state 's case by showing that the DEA violated the air space ove Harold 's farm by flying too low ut you do n't need to know that . All you need to know is , we had a deal . Time to refill the tank . Eddie smiles . Taps the side of the Lincoln .
EDDIE: Sure , gas-guzzler like this . I heard you got three more . What 's one man need with four Lincolns ?
MICK: Ten . I 'm flying the guy in from Kodak in New York , he wants usiness class
EDDIE: And I want Harold back on the farm . He 's the best farmer we got , if you know what I mean
MICK: I do n't . And I do n't want to . Either pay me my money or go with the Public Defender the judge finds you . Of course he wo n't know much about air space , but
EDDIE: Keep your shirt on , Counsellor . We want you .
MICK: You had the whole ten ready . What if you 'd backed me down to five ?
EDDIE: This vest got lots of pocket .
MICK: Louis Roulet ?
LOUIS: Yes Mr. Haller
MICK: You want me to represent you fo your first appearance . I get twenty- five hundred for that . We can work out what comes next .
LOUIS: Thank you This is a set-up , Mr. Haller I made a mistake with that woman , she was setting me up
MICK: Keep your voice down . And do n't say anything about the case , not til I 've got you out on bail . Okay ?
LOUIS: That 's him . Cecil Dobbs .
MICK: Is he ready to post bail ?
LOUIS: He 'll do whatever he has to .
MICK: Okay , tell me about yourself . How old are you ?
LOUIS: Thirty-two
MICK: Ties to the community ? You grow up here , go to school ?
LOUIS: Both . Beverly Hills , UCLA . I work for my mother 's business
MICK: `` Windsor Estates ? ''
LOUIS: It 's named for her second husband .
MICK: How much did you make last year ? If I 'm going to get you out I need to know everything .
LOUIS: My taxes last year said fou hundred thousand .
JUNKIE: I want a lawyer too , you got a card ?
MICK: They 'll have one for you out there . I need you to back up and leave us alone . Can you do that , pal ?
LOUIS: No bail ?
MICK: I said they 're going to ask it . When was the last time you were arrested ?
LOUIS: Never .
MICK: So if I checked your record
LOUIS: you 'd find parking tickets .
MICK: We 're not talking about the case , emember ? Not even to the judge .
LOUIS: Do n't I even say `` Not guilty ? ''
MICK: Today 's about setting arraignment , period . You say nothing .
LOUIS: Are you going to get me out ?
MICK: I 'm gon na try , Louis .
THEN: One more thing There are lots of lawyers . Why pick me ?
LOUIS: I.. remembered your name from some case in the papers
MICK: What case ?
LOUIS: A drug case , I do n't know .
MICK: You remember the name or anything ?
LOUIS: No but you got the evidence thrown out against some guy Does it matter ? I need your help , Mr. Haller . Off Mick , GO TO ,
MICK: Are you the prosecutor who used to have the Roulet case ?
MAGGIE: Do n't tell me . Son of a bitch , Haller .
MICK: Rules are rules .
MAGGIE: I wanted this one
YIELDS: Alright I 'll go quietly . But afte today 's hearing , if you do n't object .
MICK: Depends . You going for no-bail ?
MAGGIE: That wo n't change with the prosecutor . Not with what your guy did . With which she shows him the photo gruesome .
MICK: If he did it .
MAGGIE: Sure . `` If . '' They only picked him up in her home with blood all ove him , but it 's a valid question
MICK: I love it when you 're sarcastic . Can I at least see the arrest eport ?
MAGGIE: Get it from whoever takes over . No favors on this one .
MICK: How 's Hayley ?
MAGGIE: She 's good . She likes the things you send her but would rather you show up yourself
MICK: How about this weekend ?
MAGGIE: Okay , I 'll tell Hayley . Tonight . Only Mick do n't cancel on her .
MICK: Judge , there is no way the state can claim my client is a flight
MAGGIE: With resources like this man has , it 's always a risk let alone the fact that the victim was brutally
JUDGE: Ms. McPherson , the extent of he injuries are not the point . I 'm setting bail at a million dollars Mick wins , Maggie loses . Exchange glances
VAL: What 'd I tell you , Mick , we got us a franchise
MICK: We 'll see , Val
VAL: There 's the lawyer-guy , you get him to go for the cash-bond
MICK: Cecil Dobbs ?
DOBBS: Mr. Haller . It was depressing to see the boy caught up in that cattle call
MICK: Boy ?
DOBBS: I 've represented the family so long I think of Louis that way .
MICK: He did look a little frail . My advice is , let Mr. Valenzuela fix you up with a bond and take `` the oy '' home .
DOBBS: A bond ? But Mrs. Windsor was thinking of putting up property
MICK: No good . Assessing it will take days . By then Louis might be carrying somebody 's child . So just tap Val for the bond , spring Louis , and take him to you office . We 'll meet there at Four .
DOBBS: Mrs. Windsor 's sensitive about the press
MICK: I saw you in there filming . What 's your name ?
CAMERAMAN: Rob Gillen . They call me `` Sticks . ''
MICK: You freelancing on this , Sticks ?
STICKS: Your client 's got profile , I figure I can sell it to local news .
MICK: How much ?
STICKS: 'Scuse me ?
MICK: How much will they pay you for what you shot today ?
STICKS: That depends . Seven , seven-fifty .
MICK: Suppose we take it off your hands for eight .
DOS: Of course . Absolutely .
MICK: Then let 's talk about my fees . I 'll need a hundred thousand up front . Working off five-fifty an hour , it 'll come to another hundred thousand if we go to trial . That 's estimating the trial at a week . Appeals , we start over .
LORNA'S VOICE: How 'd it go , Mickey ? We get the case ?
MICK: We 've got it if we want it . I 'd still like to know the state 's case , what they 've got on him
LORNA'S VOICE: What 's the difference ? 'Course we want the case
MICK: I 've got an hour til he 's released . Til then I 'll be at county . With Gloria . Any calls ?
LORNA'S VOICE: Only Sticks . He says he owes you five hundred next time he sees you .
MICK: Yeah he does .
GLORIA: Mickey Mantle . You 're going to bat for me again ?
MICK: You do n't even know who the Mick was . You do n't look good , Gloria .
GLORIA: Thanks . For coming , not for the compliment .
MICK: Something new for you , getting ooked on possession of coke , along with the usual .
GLORIA: Dumb , I know . A guy paid me with it , I had it on me when I went to my next .
MICK: And your next was a cop .
GLORIA: Ca n't you get me into one of those ehab places where they get you straight ?
MICK: We did a pre-trial rehab , last time . The D.A . wo n't go for it again . You may have to do some jail here .
GLORIA: I ca n't .
MICK: Yeah you can . They 've got programs in jail , too . Look , you 've had a long run . Maybe after this you can finally get out of the life .
GLORIA: And do what ? Have kids and plant flowers ? Look at me .
MICK: Okay , tell me what happened .
GLORIA: I did a guy at the Travel Lodge on Santa Monica
MICK: The one who paid you coke instead of money ?
GLORIA: He had a shitload in there . I saw .
MICK: Do you know who he was ?
GLORIA: No . He reached me on my website . He was Mexican or something .
MICK: Did you screen him ?
GLORIA: Do n't I screen 'em all ?
MICK: off what , his driver 's license ?
GLORIA: No , his passport . I think his name was , Hector , or
MICK: Hector what ? Last name . Think .
LESLIE FAIRE: And your girl 's looking to trade ?
MICK: She 'll give you his motel and room number .
LESLIE FAIRE: She 'll also have to testify on the coke .
MICK: That 's a No . Location only . You guys take it from there . My investigator says Hector has n't checked out yet .
LESLIE FAIRE: What 's she want in exchange ?
MICK: You drop charges , and all she does is a Pre-trial Rehabilitation . The facility at USC-Med would be nice . Or do I take this straight to the Feds ?
DOBBS: Mrs. Windsor , I ca n't commend Mr. Haller highly enough for his performance in court this morning . Mary Windsor nods , provisionally pleased .
MARY WINDSOR: I have a check for you , Mr. Haller .
MICK: I 'm going to need that to come from your son , Mrs. Windsor . You can give him the money so he can write the check . But I want the check to come from Louis . He 's my client and that 's got to be clea from the start . No offense .
MARY WINDSOR: Do n't be silly . I 'll back my son come hell or high water . These idiculous charges . That ridiculous woman .
MICK: It 's good to know you 'll be there when we need you .
MARY WINDSOR: But not now , is that it ?
MICK: We 'll be going over the case . The D.A . could make you testify about what you hear . Attorney privilege does n't cover you .
MARY WINDSOR: I will see you at dinner .
LOUIS: My mother built a good business . From the ground up .
MICK: I 've got no trouble believing that . I say we get started . All agree , they sit , Mick starts up
LOUIS: No . I want this behind me .
MICK: You sure ? You can stretch things out , enjoy your freedom . Most clients
LOUIS: Guilty clients , you mean . I want this over . Mick 's struck by how firm .
MICK: Fine . We go to trial right away . Puts more pressure on the D.A .
DOBBS: Or maybe the case never even goes to trial . Our firm 's clout is considerable . Pressure can be brought to bear
LOUIS: There wo n't be any negotiating . No plea bargain , no nothing . I 'm not going to jail for something I did n't do .
MICK: It might not be jail .
LOUIS: Even if I walk . I 'm innocent and if there 's a trial I want to get on the stand and tell the jury I 'm innocent . If that 's a problem we can part company right now .
MICK: Time to tell me what happened . Louis . Removes his Ray-Bans . SUDDENLY
RAUL: Regina Campo , goes by `` Reggie . '' Twenty six . An actress and a telephone solicitor .
DOBBS: And hoping to retire . Soon as she sues my client .
MICK: Did you know her before last night ?
RAUL: Nope . They do n't have the othe guy . They do n't even have the bar .
MICK: All they 've got is , Louis shows up and beats the crap out of her ?
RAUL: That 's it .
LOUIS: That is such bullshit
MICK: Just keep telling me .
LOUIS: She hit me with something and I went down . It got black fast .
MICK: Okay then . What do you remembe next ?
LOUIS: Waking up with two guys sitting on me . Holding me down .
RAUL: Police report has them , homosexual couple from down the hall
LOUIS: Like I said . Faggots . To which Raul says nothing . After a beat
MICK: Go on , Louis .
LOUIS: I was still foggy when the cops came
REGGIE: .he was like an animal ! He said he 'd rape me and kill me then ape me again when I was dead
MICK: Set it up how ?
LOUIS: Put blood on my hand . My left hand . But I 'm right-handed , I 'd use my ight if I was going to punch someone . Which is crazy .
DOBBS: Louis never hit anyone in his life .
RAUL: What she did made sense . It 's the ight side of her face that was hit , she had to bloody your left .
MICK: Louis You said she opened the doo a crack . Did you see her face ?
LOUIS: Not all of it
MICK: And then she clocks him ?
LOUIS: Yes .
MICK: So our case is , she beat herself up ?
LOUIS: She must have .
DOBBS: Of course . She saw his Porsche , his Rolex , it 's known the family has money I 'll wager she 's already filed in civil court . Mick . Thinks . Then , to Raul
MICK: Okay , the police report . Let 's hea how Reggie tells it .
LOUIS: This is n't my knife .
MICK: Raul , are his prints on there ?
RAUL: That 's what the report says . I 'm not surprised , if she put blood on his hands she 's gon na put prints on his knife
LOUIS: I told you , it 's not `` my '' knife !
MICK: Okay , how 's she say he went down ?
RAUL: `` As Ms. Campo entered the hallway , she pushed the intruder backwards into a large floor vase ''
LOUIS: Those are all lies , this is bull
MICK: If everything she said is a lie , this will be the easiest case ever . I 'll tear her apart and throw he entrails into the sea . But Louis You swear it 's all lies ? Is there anything you are n't telling me ?
LOUIS: Nothing .
MICK: .it 's just quirky enough .
RAUL: Quirky enough for what ?
MICK: To be true . Maybe it went down just like he says . Anyway there 's a. chance .
RAUL: An innocent client . Jeezus .
MICK: Yeah . But you know what my fathe said about innocent clients Maggie 's overheard this , gives the answer .
MAGGIE: He said there 's no client as scary as an innocent man .
MICK: That 's right . Because if you screw up and he goes to prison , it scars you for life . There 's only one verdict . You 've got to put an N.G . on the board .
ADDS: Hey Mags . She reads the state he 's in .
MAGGIE: Raul , if you let a man drive in his condition I think I can charge you oth .
RAUL: And how will you get home ?
MAGGIE: My friends brought me . I 'll keep the car , he can pick it up at my place in the morning .
TO MICK: Get in .
MICK: Okay , you know the moves . Make the ounds , check out Morgan 's Bar
RAUL: And Mr. Corvette
MICK: And Regina Campo . The way Louis says she came on 's got me wondering .
TUPAC: `` God bless the dead and buried nigga , Do n't worry if you see God first , Tell him shit got worse ''
MAGGIE: You 've got to be kidding me .
MICK: Earl lays this stuff on me .
MAGGIE: Where is Earl tonight ?
MICK: I never keep him this late .
MAGGIE: Has n't he worked your fee off yet ?
MICK: A while ago . But he likes driving , keeps him out of trouble He 's taking courses , too , in music .
MAGGIE: You ca n't tell by this stuff . She snaps the rap OFF .
MICK: You get used to it . Besides , Tupac , he helps me understand my clients . Most of them go to school on his
MAGGIE: Not Roulet .
MICK: Not Louis , no . Louis is my franchise player , he pays for all the rest After a beat Office gossip
MAGGIE: I heard Smithson assigned Ted Minton to your case .
MICK: Never heard of him .
MAGGIE: He 's brand new . Bright , though . Smithson 's protegee . Naturally . Georgetown , buys his suits at Brooks , above all he 's a guy
MICK: Lorna made me my schedule . Saturday 's fine to take Hayley .
MAGGIE: Saturday there 's the Sponge-Bo movie
MICK: I 'm all over it . How 's she doing ?
MAGGIE: I 'll know when I drop you and get home to relieve the sitter What ?
MICK: Moonlight becomes you .
GLANCES: That 's not doing me any good , Haller .
MICK: Thanks .
DARIUS: The day I get my sentence ?
JUDGE FLYNN: That too . But it 's also St. Patrick 's Day . A day to revel in your Irish heritage .
MI CK: He 's an asshole but just be cool .
JUDGE FLYNN: Do you know the origin of you name , Mr. McGinley ?
DARIUS: Slave-holder , I 'spect . Why do I care who that motherfucka be ?
MICK: Darius I told you
DARIUS: The man 's dissin ' me !
GLARES: Alright If you do n't care about your name , then I do n't .
MICK: What could n't wait , Raul ?
RAUL: Wan na see a movie ?
RAUL'S VOICE: We caught a break . The owner had a camera installed to watch his egister after he caught the help dipping in last year
MICK'S VOICE: And here comes Louis .
RAUL: I had the tape transferred to disc , so I could manipulate , y'know
RAUL'S VOICE: And Mr. X . The Corvette-man .
MICK'S VOICE: Are you sure ?
RAUL'S VOICE: Would n't have popped a grand fo the tape if I was n't . Now watch
MICK'S VOICE: I know the place . They got a smoking porch out front .
RAUL'S VOICE: That 's where he goese . Giving Reggie her chance . Watch her .
MICK: Do the cops have this ?
RAUL: How can they ? I got the one and only . It ai n't a copy .
MICK: You 're exceedingly beautiful .
RAUL: Wait . .Reggie and X decide to split
RAUL'S VOICE: Check out his hand , his watch .
MICK'S VOICE: It 's on his left . That 's no good
MICK: It means he 's right-handed . But the facial blows were from the left
RAUL: Slow down . You said you knew Morgan 's . So you oughta realize This image is in the mirror ove the bar . That 's how the owner set the camera to watch his register .
MICK: So everything 's backwards
RAUL: And X punches with his left .
MICK: I told you you were beautiful . Anything else ?
RAUL: Yeah . But it 's not on the tape . You know how you were wondering about Regina ?
MICK: Yeah ? Raul just looks at him . Off Mick ,
ROBIN: Mr. Roulet is with someone . He ca n't be disturbed .
LOUIS: It 's okay , Robin . You can go .
MICK: There wo n't be any showings in Pelican Bay .
LOUIS: Where 's that ?
MICK: It 's a supermax prison where they send violent sex offenders . You 'll fit in real good in your loafers .
LOUIS: What 's the matter ?
MICK: You lied to me , Louis . I 'm about to go and see the new prosecutor , who 's doing everything he can to put you away , and now I find out you 've been lying . Tell me about Reggie Campo .
LOUIS: What about her ? I 've told you
MICK: You did n't tell me . That you were going to pay her for sex . You think it 's hard to find out somebody 's not Snow White ?
LOUIS: Alright yes , I was going to pay . She wrote down a price on the napkin , four hundred dollars
MICK: Why did n't you tell me this in Cecil 's office ?
LOUIS: I did n't want my mother to know . Cecil tells her everything . And can we keep it down ? Her office is on the other side of that door
MICK: This changes things . You see that , do n't you ?
LOUIS: I 'm not a lawyer . Explain it to me .
MICK: Alright I will . You know that guy on the Venice boardwalk ? The one who has all those plates spinning on sticks ?
LOUIS: What does this have to do with
MICK: Just listen . A bunch of spinning plates that 's the state 's case . In the middle is a big one . It 's a fucking platter . And if that falls it takes the others down with it . The big plate is the victim . The only witness against you . I knock her down , the act is over and the crowd goes home . No trial . Mick has Louis ' attention now .
LOUIS: You can make this trial go away ?
MICK: We 've lost time . You concealed from me the fact that could do it . It comes down to why .
LOUIS: Why what ?
MICK: Why would a guy with a Porsche and a Rolex need a knife to get sex from a woman who sells it anyway ? The answer is , he would n't . And when you see that you see the set- up , the trap . And suddenly it 's the defendant who looks like the victim . Louis gets it . Penitent .
LOUIS: You 're going to the prosecutor now ?
MICK: Yes . Young hot-shot named Ted Minton . He wants to give me the discovery file . Poor guy does n't know that Raul already got it . He 's new to felonies but he 's no dope . When he hears his vic 's a hooke he 'll know we 've knocked all his plates down .
LOUIS: Then it 'll be over ?
MICK: No promises , Louis .
MRS. WINDSOR: I did n't know you were here . Is there news ?
LOUIS: There will be , Mother .
SECRETARY: Are these for A.D.A . Knight ?
KURLEN: Yeah , and they 're my only copies . I 'll wait while you copy them .
SECRETARY: I 'll have to ask her
KURLEN: Just what I wanted to hear .
MICK: Detective Kurlen .
KURLEN: Puttin ' a case away . Guy drowned his neighbor 's kid in a tub to see what it felt like . It wo n't shock you to hear he was high
MICK: Thanks for clearing that up .
KURLEN: If he gets San Quentin , maybe he can look up your boy Jesus Martinez .
MICK: Is Minton back yet ?
SECRETARY #2: He 'll be a few more minutes , sir .
KURLEN: How 's he doin ' up there , anyway ? He make the pucker-up-and-kiss-me team ?
MICK: I have n't talked to him .
KURLEN: I guess once they plead guilty , they 're not much use to you .
MICK: He got life , but he 'll be out . I do n't know when .
KURLEN: Too bad . 'Cause his victim , Martha Renteria ? She 's dead forever .
MICK: You do n't have to remind me you were lead dick on that . Kurlen grins . Shakes his head .
KURLEN: How 's a guy like you sleep at night ? With the scum you represent .
MICK: I had a client once , he decapitated his ex-wife , then kept her head in the refrigerator .
DISGUSTED: Naturally you got him off .
MICK: The D.A . got greedy . Tried to pile on two unsolved murders , trick up evidence to stick my guy with them . It 's called the justice system , we do n't do things that way .
KURT. EN: So your guy 's out walkin ' around . He ever do it again ?
MICK: I do n't know . I never heard of him after that .
KURLEN: But he could have . Fuck you , Haller .
TED: Mr. Haller ? Sorry you had to wait . I hope it 'll e worth your while .
MICK: Looks kinda thin for a discovery
TED: Yes well We can go to my office
MICK: I 've got a question first .
TED: What else do you have ? The simple , polite question throws Mick .
MICK: Look Ted , let 's cut the bullshit . Not only is your so-called victim a working prostitute , but we 've got her on tape soliciting my client ! Maybe you 're new , but you got ta know how hard it 's gon na be to convince a jury a guy would have to ape a hooker to have sex with her
TED: Nothing you 're telling me 's going to change my offer .
MICK: Offer ? You 're making an offer ? going forward ?
TED: We 'll drop the charges to Assault with a Deadly and Attempted Sexual Battery . The guidelines put him at seven years , maybe he 'll do four .
MICK: .What am I missing here ? Ted stays innocent-looking . Blank .
EARL: Got you the good stuff , Hayley
HAYLEY: Thank you , Earl .
EARL: Man 's got your ride ready
MICK: Go on , I 'll hold your ice cream .
HAYLEY: You said we ' , re going to the movies ! You promised me last week !
MICK: Daddy 's got to talk to somebody . You stay with Earl . Mick gets out , Hayley stays
LOUIS: What 's happened ? Is it over ? You said it would be over by now
MICK: That was before I found out you were still lying to me .
LOUIS: This was n't the knife in the file
MICK: That 's right . The file Raul got us was a loaded deck . The cops must have been on to him , because they used it to set us up . So we 'd think they had nothing , when in fact they had enough to put your Hugo Boss , golf-playing ass away for twenty years !
LOUIS: I did n't lie . I said the one in the picture was n't mine . Mick frowns/grins at the answer
MOCKING: What are you now , a lawyer ? A clever , third-rate fucking lawye with smart-ass technicalities ? `` You said it was n't yours '' What you should have said was , `` I had a knife but this is n't it ! '' What did you think , it would just go away ? You brought a murder weapon to a meeting with a prostitute , Louis ! How am I supposed to make that look like she set you up ?
LOUIS: 1 . Did . Not . Do this .
MICK: Then kindly tell me why you went to her apartment with a custom-made knife , serrated tip , with `` LR '' engraved on the blade ?
LOUIS: I always carry it . For a moment , Mick takes this in . Echoes .
MICK: You always carry it .
LOUIS: Yes . In real estate we show homes , to people we do n't know . This one time
MICK: Who was there ?
LOUIS: The man . He raped her . When she did n't come back , I went to the house and found her .
MICK: That 's quite a story , Louis .
BEAT: Your mother will have to testify .
LOUIS: We do n't want that .
COLD: I do n't give a damn what you think we want . From now on you do what I tell you while I try this case . Do I make myself clear ?
MICK: If she was n't so darn heavy I 'd carry her all night , I swear .
MAGGIE: Defense lawyers will swear to anything
MICK: It turned into a rough week . Being with Hayley was the only high .
MAGGIE: Nobody 's seen you at Four Green Fields lately .
MICK: I stopped going . Too much of a scene .
MAGGIE: Yeah well . If you start going again . Now she has his attention .
MICK: If I start again , what ? She 's awkward . Smiles , shrugs to cover
MAGGIE: Bunch of us from the office are there . Tuesdays , after work . An invitation . S-zrprising him .
MICK: I 'll keep it in mind .
MAGGIE: Okay .
MICK: Okay .
MAGGIE: Haller ! Let him in , girls ! Buy you a beer ?
MICK: You wo n't make it to the bar
MAGGIE: Then let 's share this .
MICK: Yeah , that 's exactly what
MAGGIE: With that guy Corliss , right ? I told them using that dirtbag was a ullshit play . But you 'll take the the guy 's head off on the stand
MICK: So Ted talked to you about Corliss ?
MAGGIE: Huh ? It was me who sent him to Ted . Corliss thought it was my case ecause I handled first appearance . I 'm telling you too much .
MICK: Nah , nothing I do n't know , they always use a professional snitch I mean Corliss has done this efore , right ?
MAGGIE: Ca n't we just forget work and have a friendly Guiness ?
MICK: How about we go somewhere to eat ? So we can talk about our daughter .
WEAKENS: Let me tell my friends I 'm leaving .
MAGGIE: I 'll bet you did n't know Sponge-Bo movies could be so much fun .
MICK: The fun 's watching her .
MAGGIE: You did n't know Minton had Corliss til I blabbed , did you .
MICK: He was hiding something , I thought it might be a jailhouse snitch
MAGGIE: You got me drunk to find out what you wanted to know . Except I was already drunk . Good point , right ?
MICK: one good turn . I 'll drive you .
MAGGIE: And will you take me back to get my car in the morning ?
MICK STIRS: Waking up and finding you here . She 'll get her hopes up .
MICK: How 'd she get in here ?
MAGGIE: She comes in here when she has nightmares . She has nightmares .
MICK: So she sleeps in here a lot ?
MAGGIE: Do n't start . You have no idea what it 's like raising a child alone .
MICK: Look I 'll leave then come back in an hour . We 'll go together to get your car then I can take her to
MAGGIE: Just like that ? You 're gon na start taking her to school ?
MICK: Do n't you remember what we talked about last night ?
MAGGIE: I thought you were just trying to get into my head on your case o get me into bed
MICK: I ca n't win with you
MAGGIE: Not when you 're being a defense lawyer ! Do you know how crazy we were to think we could ever make it ? Me trying to get dirtbags off the street , you keeping them there
MAGGIE: Just go !
MICK: Sorry . It 's work .

MICK: Three people saw you throwing a knife into the L.A. River
MARTINEZ: 'Cause I had that knife in my car ! I knew they was gon na find it
MICK: If all you did was fuck her then why did n't you leave any prints ? The place was wiped down
MARTINEZ: I did n't forget nothing ! I jus ' used that towel , then I give the chick the money and I left !

MICK: I am trying to make it right . Martinez is silent . Cold .
MARTINEZ: Tell you what ?

MICK: And then went home . The story starts after he left .
GETS IT: The real killer .
MICK: The real killer . She lets him in .
RAUL: A short-blade folding knife
MICK: Or whose face Martinez picked out of the mug-shots I brought him ?
RAUL: Do n't do this to yourself
MICK: The lawyer who just assumes he did it because of the DNA . The lawye who gets him the best deal he can , and feels pretty good , because the deal keeps his client off Death Row and this guy , this lawyer , he 's all about the deal , see ?
RAUL: Mick You ca n't beat yourself up for what you did n't know

RAUL: Who he 's seen before , remember
MICK: Yeah but tonight he sees who she looks like .
RAUL: Renteria ?
MICK: Right . And he 's right back there .
DOUBTFUL: Mick , we 're talking about a really
MICK: We 're talking about a killer at work . You know that video from the ar ? Just like you , he saw that Mr. X was left-handed .
RAUL: Smart as the devil
MICK: He knows what he 's doing . Reggie 's the luckiest woman alive .
RAUL: You think there are others ? With that face , or
MICK: You find out . Dig into Roulet . `` All you 'll find is parking tickets , '' I do n't buy that anymore . Check out knife-murders of women . Not just the unsolved ones , Martha Renteria was a closed case .
RAUL: Look man , I ca n't throw a net like that . I 'm just one guy ! You got ta ing the cops in .

SOBEL: We would n't have found him if a neighbor had n't brought the dog ack . It was running loose .
LANKFORD: Your name 's all over this . Were you the only guy he worked for ?
MICK: No , but I 've got a big trial next month , attempted rape and murder . He was helping me .
SOBEL: Is that the Roulet case ?
MICK: How did you know ?
SOBEL: Because every file that 's been ifled has the name .
LANKFORD: Only thing , Roulet himself is already cleared for this . We 've checked the tracking on his tracer- anklet and it does n't show him anywhere near this place . And there 's no way to trick those things , no way in the world .
MICK: I 'm a suspect ?
SOBEL: He knew whoever shot him . There are no signs of forcible , he even let the killer into the back room .
MICK: I was watching my daughter play soccer . A couple of dozen people can confirm I was there .
LANKFORD: Put these on and do n't touch anything back there .
SOBEL: Can you tell us if you see anything unusual ? Mick draws close . Lankford , abruptly
LANKFORD: All I see are pictures of a guy . Was he a fruit ?
BITTER: He was a hell of an ex-cop , is what he was . Crimes Against Persons , ack in Chicago . And yeah he was gay , and what the hell 's that got to do with it ? If the murder was some kind of gay thing , why 'd they ansack the office ? Is n't it obvious they were looking fo something to do with his work ?
SOBEL: Look . The position of his hands .
LANKFORD: Was this guy a Longhorns fan o what ? Or is it some kind of sign , like he was trying to tell us who
MAKES "HORNS": `` The devil did it ? ''

MICK: Did the cops ask you where you were this morning , Val ?
VAL: You better not be sayin ' what I think that I cut him loose to let him kill Raul ?
MICK: Maybe you did n't know what he was going to do
VAL: You think I 'd let that happen ? Fo a fuckin ' TV ?

WRITING: Meaning Jesus Martinez that 's a former client of yours
MICK: In San Quentin . Right .

SOBEL: Well , we did catch a break . We found a bullet casing in the room , from a 22 . It turns out Levin owned a .22 , but when we checked it out it was n't a Woodsman , like the gun that killed him To which , Mick reacts as she goes on
MICK: Yeah just , I 'll let you know if I think of anything . About his cell- phone , I mean . Thanks .
LOUIS: Mick . I want to tell you something efore we start .
MICK: Better make it fast .
LOUIS: You 're my lawyer , right ? So I can tell you anything , even a crime I 've committed , and you have to keep it secret .
MICK: That 's right . Unless it 's one you 're going to commit .
LOUIS: I 've killed people , Mick .
COURTROOM CLERK: Two minutes , people
TO LOUIS: Now ? Now ? Why now , are you telling me this
LOUIS: Because I know your plan . Mick looks at him . Before he can deny
MICK: Come with me .
LOUIS: You 're right about one thing . I am a son of a bitch .
MICK: How did you do it ? The trace said you were n't even in Glendale
LOUIS: He was getting too close .
MICK: You piece of shit , do you think you have this wired ? You do n't !
LOUIS: I do have an insurance policy .
MICK: I want my gun , Louis
LOUIS: I walk away from this trial a free man and remain free and it never falls into wrong hands .
COURTROOM CLERK: Judge Fullbright is on the bench .
JUDGE FULLBRIGHT: Nice of you to join us
MICK: I 'm sorry , your honor .
TED: What this case is about is a predator On the night of March Sixth , Louis Roulet was out stalking his prey Jury of twelve , two alternates
LORNA: You had a message from Gloria . She thinks she can do what you asked .
MICK: Thinks ?
LORNA: Corliss has the same meal time . She can try .
DISCOURAGED: Let her try . But it may not matter .
LORNA: What do you mean ?
MICK: I mean , Corliss is n't on the witness list . It could be Ted Minton is holding him back . He wo n't use him until he has to . Until I screw up his case so bad he has no choice .
LORNA: Mickey ? Can you do that ? Off Mick , tries for a confident smile
TED: Frightened ?
OFFICER MAXWELL: She kept asking us if she was safe , even after Roulet was taken away .
MICK: Officer , would you read from you arrest report where it 's marked ?
OFFICER MAXWELL: `` The victim does not know the man who assaulted her or why she was attacked . ''
MICK: Why did you write that she did n't know him ?
OFFICER MAXWELL: Because that 's what she said .
MICK: So , she just opened the door at ten o'clock to a stranger ?
OFFICER MAXWELL: She did n't put it like that
MICK: Was there blood on his right hand ?
OFFICER MAXWELL: No , his left . Or we would have agged his right one , too .
TED: Mr. Talbot , you were with Miss Campo on the night of March Sixth ?
TALBOT: Yep . Had a date with her at Morgan 's . Then from there we went to her place and had another date , if you know what I mean .
TED: Had you known Miss Campo before ?
TALBOT: Nope . Just called her up .
TED: How did you know to call her ?
TALBOT: From her website . She 's got a real good website .
TED: Did you have sexual relations ?
TALBOT: Four hundred bucks worth . And she earned every cent .
TED: And what time did you leave ?
TALBOT: About five minutes before ten .
TED: She say she had another engagement ?
TALBOT: No , she acted like she was done fo the night
MICK: Objection , I do n't think Mr. Talbot 's qualified to interpret Ms. Campo 's thinking or plans
TALBOT: I just mean she acted satisfied
OFFENDED: Sustained ! Go on , Mr. Minton .
TED: When you left , what condition was she in ? Was she hurt ?
TALBOT: No , she was fit as a fiddle . I know ecause I 'd just played her . Sorry , your honor . She was fine .
TED: She did n't look like this ?
TALBOT: Man . What kind of bastard does something like that ?
FULLBRIGHT: Answer the question .
TALBOT: No . We made consensual and pleasurable love . Which is what life is all about . Then I paid her .
MICK: Mr. Talbot , are you right or left- handed ?
TALBOT: Left .
MICK: Left . And is n't it true that before you left Regina Campo asked you to strike her repeatedly in the face ?
OBJECTING: Your honor , there 's no basis fo this sort of questioning . Mr. Haller is just muddying the waters with outrageous statements .
MICK: Part of the defense theory , Judge .
FULLBRIGHT: The witness can answer .
TALBOT: I never hit her or any other woman .
MICK: Do you know a prostitute named Shaquille Barton ? `` Shaquilla Shakels '' is her work name .
TALBOT: Okay , yeah . I seen her one time
MICK: And if I brought her here and she said you had struck her with you left hand
TALBOT: She 'd be lying . I tried Shaquilla , that rough stuff 's not for me . I 'm a missionary man .
MICK: With a strong left . Thank you .
LANKFORD: Good enough to search your house . For a Woodsman registered to you .
SOBEL: We need to run ballistics on it .
MICK: I do n't anymore . It was stolen .
LANKFORD: We got the history on the piece . Turns out it belonged to Mickey Cohen the gangster , in the forties .
MICK: I know . My father represented him . He got him off for using it in self- defense , so Cohen made him a present of it .
SOBEL: Why did n't you report it stolen ?
MICK: Because I knew who took it . A client . He told me , so I could n't turn him in without breaking a trust . They do that .
LANKFORD: Still and all , mind if I look around ? Just in case you have n't had time to toss it off a pier ?
MICK: Go crazy . You 've got the warrant .
LANKFORD: Heidi bag the box . He leaves . As she bags it He wonders why .
MICK: You ca n't do ballistics on a box .
SOBEL: That old Mickey Cohen shooting ? It 's kind of famous . It turns out the county still has the evidence in storage . The bullet .
MICK: You can match casings to a slug that 's fifty years old ?
SOBEL: It 'd be easier with the gun , but yeah .
MICK: Detective ? How long will ballistics take ?
SOBEL: Careful . You 'll make me think you 're worried what we 'll find .
MICK: I 'm in the middle of a trial .
SOBEL: A day . Maybe forty-eight hours . She leaves . Mick 's gaze , in the mirror Fear .
TED: Morning , Haller . Word is , you had interesting visitors last night
MICK: Worry about yourself , Ted . You 're dying the death of a thousand azors up there and you do n't even know it .
TED: One last witness , your honor . The prosecution calls Regina Campo .
REGGIE: It 's true that I lied . I knew him when he came to the door .
TED: In fact , you 'd arranged his coming Miss Campo why did you lie ?
REGGIE: I was scared . I was n't sure the police would believe me and I wanted to make sure they arrested him because he 's an animal
TED: Do you regret that decision now ?
REGGIE: Yes . If it helps him to get free and do this to somebody else .
MICK: Your honor , prejudicial
JUDGE FULLBRIGHT: Sustained .
TED: I have no further questions fo Regina , your honor . Ted sits .
JUDGE FULLBRIGHT: Your witness , Mr. Haller .
LOUIS: I want to remind you of your words . You were going to tear her apart and throw her entrails into the sea .
MICK: That 's it , keep acting like you pull the strings .
LOUIS: I do .
JUDGE FULLBRIGHT: Mr. Haller .
MICK: Ms. Campo have you engaged an attorney to sue Mr. Roulet for the events of March Sixth ?
REGGIE: ( recovers , No I have n't .
MICK: But have you talked to an attorney ?
REGGIE: I have n't hired anybody or
MICK: I asked if you talked to one . About a possible lawsuit .
REGGIE: It was nothing more than talk
MICK: Did you ask if you could sue Mr. Roulet for damages ?
REGGIE: I thought what you say to lawyers is private .
MICK: If you wish , you can tell the jurors .
REGGIE: I think I want to keep it private . Ted squirms again . Wrong answer .
MICK: Okay , let 's go back to the night at Morgan 's . Had you ever seen Louis Roulet before that night ?
REGGIE: Yes . There and other places .
MICK: Ever noticed he wore a Rolex watch ?
MICK: Or that he drove one of two cars , a Porsche or a Range Rover ?
REGGIE: I never saw him driving .
MICK: And what made you approach him ?
REGGIE: I knew he was in the life . You know . A player . I had seen him leave with girls who do what I do .
MICK: With prostitutes . To go to a hotel , or their apartments ?
REGGIE: I do n't know where .
MICK: So how do you know they left ? Maybe they just went out for a smoke
REGGIE: Because they got in his car and drove away .
MICK: But you just testified that you never saw Mr. Roulet drive ! Now you saw him leave with a prostitute like yourself . Which is it ?
REGGIE: I saw him get in a car but I did n't know what kind it was .
MICK: Do you know the difference between a Porsche and a Range Rover ?
REGGIE: one 's big and one 's small , I guess .
MICK: The women he left with , when you saw them again , had they been eaten or injured ?
REGGIE: I do n't know , I did n't ask .
MICK: But girls in your profession talk about customers , do n't you ? Warn each other if someone 's a freak
REGGIE: Yeah , usually
MICK: And how many had warned you about Louis Roulet ?
REGGIE: None . No one .
MICK: So you believed you 'd be safe ?
REGGIE: I , thought he was a known quantity and I needed the money , so
MICK: So you thought he could solve you need for money ?
MICK: No ? Is n't that why we 're sitting here ? Because you zeroed in on him ?
REGGIE: No ! I mean yes , but not like that ( looking round , a plea to
BE BELIEVED: He attacked me , I swear !
MICK: What did the napkin say , Ms. Campo ?
REGGIE: My name and address
MICK: And your price ?
REGGIE: Yes . Four hundred dollars .
MICK: It 's a hard line of work
REGGIE: And dangerous .
MICK: In fact , have n't you told friends you were looking for a way out ?
REGGIE: Yes . I 'm not proud of what I do
MICK: And so , is n't it true nothing would be easier to understand that you saw Louis Roulet and his money as a way out ?
REGGIE: No ! That 's not what this is about ! That man hit me and tried to kill me .
MICK: Yes , we 've heard you say that
TO FULLBRIGHT: Judge may I ask the witness to stand up ?
JUDGE FULLBRIGHT: The witness will stand . I hope you 're going somewhere with this , Mr. Haller . Reggie stands .
MICK: Now if you please , walk over to my client .
REGGIE: Yes You can do amazing things when you 're afraid
MICK: How much do you weigh , Ms. Campo ? Because your website REGGIE-FOR-FUN- DOT-COM says one hundred three
REGGIE: That 's right .
MICK: I 've got no further questions fo the witness , your honor .
JUDGE FULLBRIGHT: Mr. Minton ? Do you have anothe witness for us ? Ted rouses , summons confidence , rises WHILE , ASIDE , Louis to Mick , re Ted
LOUIS: He looks worried . Mick watching Ted , waits , tense
TED: The state rests , your honor . Mick 's disappointed No Corliss .
MICK: Not worried enough .
JUDGE FULLBRIGHT: Then the defense will call its first witness after lunch . And the gavel comes down .
MARY WINDSOR: Yes , I recognize this knife . It 's the one my son carried with him for protection for the last four years . Almost exactly .
MICK: Why would he need protection ?
MARY WINDSOR: Because realtors alone in a house are sometimes robbed or hurt Even raped or murdered .
MICK: But has Louis ever been the subject of such a crime ?
MARY WINDSOR: No . But he knew someone who
MICK: Go on , please .
MARY WINDSOR: She was raped and robbed by a man . Louis found her . It was terrible . The first thing he did afterwards was get himself a knife to carry , at all times . March Sixth would have been no different .
TED: Mrs. Windsor , you seemed pretty exact , about when your son started carrying around this , this weapon , a five-inch folding knife
MARY WINDSOR: I am . The incident took place on June ninth , two-thousand-one .
TED: Was it in the newspapers ?
MARY WINDSOR: No .
TED: Or , do you somehow remember because the police came to talk to Louis
MARY WINDSOR: There was no police investigation .
TED: Then how can you remember the exact date so well ? Were you given the date before testifying here ?
MARY WINDSOR: I know the date because I 'll neve forget the day I was attacked .
JUDGE FULLBRIGHT: Mr. Minton anything else ? Ted , still thrown , stares down at his notes .
TED: As Louis 's mother , you 'd do or say anything to save him , would n't you ?
MARY WINDSOR: I would n't lie . Not about what happened that day
TED: We have no police or hospital ecord that it even occurred
MARY WINDSOR: I never reported it
TED: Why not ?
MARY WINDSOR: I was ashamed . If you do n't understand that I ca n't explain it to you . And yet I live with it every day .
TED: But it 's only you who says so
MARY WINDSOR: Is that a question ? Off Mick , admiring , GO TO ,
TED: I 've been thinking about the thousand razors .
MICK: We 've had an offer . Want to spend six months in county jail ?
LOUIS: I told you from the beginning
MICK: I know The only verdict 's Not Guilty . Okay . We 'll get there .
THEN: You still sure you want me to put you on the stand ?
LOUIS: I insist on it .
MICK: Then get some rest tonight , you 're up next .
TED: Did you talk to your client ?
MICK: Yes . No deal .
LOUIS: I turned toward the living room , the way she pointed
MICK: And what happened when you turned ?
LOUIS: Something hit me and I blacked out . I do n't know for how long .
MICK: That was all ?
LOUIS: Then when I woke up these guys were on me , telling me not to move . I could n't anyway . I was too scared .
MICK: But , there was blood on your jacket and your left hand
LOUIS: Someone put it there because I did n't .
MICK: Are you left-handed ?
LOUIS: No .
MICK: You did n't strike Ms. Campo with your left fist ?
LOUIS: No !
MICK: Threaten to rape her , or kill her ?
LOUIS: No !
MICK: You 're angry . Why ?
LOUIS: Do you know what it 's like to be accused of something like this ? To listen to people tell lies about your having done something so sick and awful ? I , I understand I had to e quiet and wait my chance and not say anything but if guilty people have rights , what about innocent people ? I am innocent !
MICK: Nothing further , Judge .
TED: According to you , Ms. Campo punched herself or had a man she never met efore punch her lights out as part of a set-up ?
LOUIS: All I know is that I did n't .
TED: And this knife you always carry , how did she know she 'd find it on you as part of the set-up ?
"HONEST": She could n't , could she ? I mean , I never took it out or showed it to anybody so she must have just found it when she went into my pocket for the money I had that I was going to pay her with , right ?
TED: I 'd really prefer it if I ask the questions , and you answer them ! Would you look at this , please
LOUIS: I do n't know who did it , but it was n't me . Nobody deserves that to happen
TED: What do you mean by `` deserves ? '' Do you mean crimes of violence come down to a whether a woman gets what she `` deserves ? ''
LOUIS: I mean no matter what she does fo a living or who she is No woman deserves that .
TED: I have no more questions .
MICK: Your honor , the defense rests .
JUDGE FULLBRIGHT: Mr. Minton ? Ted is uncertain
TED: Your honor The state needs the night to decide , your honor
JUDGE FULLBRIGHT: To decide what ?
TED: Frankly I was n't anticipating the defense would rest after two witnesses . I I 'd like the night to consider calling a rebuttal witness .
MICK: Your honor , first we 've heard of
TED: I said ` -consider . '' I need to find out if the witness is even
MICK: The state still has an obligation to disclose the identity
TED: Not if I decide not to use him . I 'm begging the court 's indulgence , your honor .
MAGGIE'S VOICE: There 's a rumor in the office
MICK: How I 'm the one who shot Raul ?
MAGGIE: Haller , is this serious ?
MICK: I 'd say so . I 'm being set up fo his murder . Couple of detectives from Glendale are following me around , just waiting for the go- ahead to hit me with an arrest warrant Could be any minute
MAGGIE: How is this possible ?
MICK: Bad timing , bad client , me being dumb
MAGGIE: Is it Roulet ? Is that the client ?
MICK: I ca n't talk to you about my clients . How is Hayley ?
MAGGIE: Fine . But Haller , if she ever hears anything about this
MICK: She wo n't . Not if I play it right .
MAGGIE: What are you going to do ?
MICK: I 'm working on it . I have a plan .
EARL: .when Not Guilty Two gets to fou thousand miles , that 's two cars eady , that 's enough to start the airport runs
MICK: Bill , I 'm getting coffee . Any fo you ?
CLERK BILL: No man , I 'm off caffeine
MICK: Hey , is that the custody list ? Can I see if any of my no-good clients are on it ?
LORNA: But Gloria still has n't let us know if she got to him !
MICK: You said she had mealtimes to work it
LORNA: Yes but
MICK: I 'll take my chances . Meantime did you serve Kurlen ?
LORNA: Yes but I did n't like forging the judge 's signature
MICK: Yes you did .
LORNA: Yes I did .
MICK: Now go , and be ready for my call . Lorna starts to go then pauses .
LORNA: I 'm crazy about the power suit .
KURLEN: What shit is this , Haller ? I got nothing to do with your case !
MICK: Subpoena to appear as a witness ? You 'll just have to wait and see . It 's a legal document , Detective .
JUDGE FULLBRIGHT: Does the state have any rebuttal ?
TED: The state calls Dwayne Jeffrey Corliss as rebuttal witness .
MICK: Judge ? Who is this witness ? Why was n't I told before now ?
JUDGE FULLBRIGHT: A fair question . Mr. Minton ?
TED: Dwayne Corliss is a cooperating witness who spoke with Mr. Roulet in custody , following his arrest .
LOUIS: Bullshit ! I did n't to talk to
JUDGE FULLBRIGHT: Quiet , Mr. Roulet ! Mr. Haller , control your client ! Mick bends over , to Louis , sotto voce
MICK: That was good . Now leave it to me . I do share my client 's outrage , your honor . I 'd at least like to know how long the state has been sitting on this testimony
TED: Mr. Corliss did not come forward until yesterday .
OUTRAGED: This is incredible
JUDGE FULLBRIGHT: Do you want to go back and talk to him ? Given the timing I 'd allow it .
MICK: No , Judge , we all know what this is , this is a jailhouse snitch , and anything he 'd say would be a lie
TED: That 's groundless , your honor
MICK: I just want my objection noted .
JUDGE FULLBRIGHT: Then I 'm going to rule he can
MICK: Can I ask one indulgence ? Can I step into the hallway and make a call to an investigator ? Fo whatever good it will do at this late date .
LORNA'S VOICE: Yep , here .
MICK: Put your watch at quarter of . At ten fifteen you enter the room .
LORNA'S VOICE: Got it .
MICK: With the printouts .
LORNA'S VOICE: Mickey , I know the moves ! He snaps shut his cell-phone .
TED: Mr. Corliss , are you incarcerated at this time ?
CORLISS: Um , no , now I 'm just in the courtroom .
TED: But you are currently held in the jail-ward at USC hospital ?
CORLISS: Yes . Since I got arrested .
TED: For burglary and drug possession ?
CORLISS: That 's right .
TED: Now . Do you know the defendant ?
CORLISS: Yes . I met him in lock-up . We was ussed over from jail , and then we was together in the tank when we came for first appearance .
TED: And did you talk at that time ?
CORLISS: Yes we talked about how bad we needed cigarettes .
TED: Anything else ?
CORLISS: You know , `` what are you in for ? '' Like that .
TED: Did he say what he was `` in for ? ''
CORLISS: He said , `` For giving a bitch exactly what she deserved . '' Those were his words .
TED: I have only one more question . Have I , or has anyone , made you promises to get you to testify ?
CORLISS: No . It 's the right thing to do .
MICK: How many times have you been arrested , Mr. Corliss ?
CORLISS: About seven in L.A . Couple of times in Phoenix if you count those .
MICK: So you know how the system works ?
CORLISS: I try to survive
MICK: And sometimes that means ratting out fellow inmates , is that it ?
TED: Objection , your honor
JUDGE FULLBRIGHT: Take a seat , Mr. Minton . I gave you leeway bringing this witness in .
MICK: Thank you , your honor . But I 'll ephrase How many times have you snitched on an inmate ? Testified against a fellow inmate for the prosecution ?
CORLISS: This makes my fourth .
LOOKING SURPRISED: Four times ? People just come up and tell you they committed crimes so you can testify against them
CORLISS: People talk to me . I 'm a friendly guy . Mick , walks toward Louis , indicates him
MICK: So you and my client were friends
CORLISS: That 's right , we was friendly
MICK: And he just said what you said he said , about what the woman `` deserved , '' and then you went back to talking about cigarettes ?
CORLISS: Not exactly . He was like , bragging . He told me he did it before
MICK: You Wait All eyes on Mick . The Judge prompts
JUDGE FULLBRIGHT: Mr. Haller ?
MICK: No more questions , your honor .
TED: Re-direct , your honor .
LOUIS: What the hell is this ?
MICK: You tell me ! What did you say to this guy ?
LOUIS: Nothing ! This is a set-up ! You 're doing this !
MICK: How ? How am I doing this ?
TED: You said he was bragging . How ?
CORLISS: Well , like , he told me the details . About the other one , that he killed .
MICK: How does he know this ?
LOUIS: Do you think I know ?
MICK: If you did n't tell him this shit somebody did . Who ? Start thinking ! RESUME Ted , moving closer to Corliss
TED: Is there anything else he told you ?
CORLISS: No , that snake-girl stuff was it .
TED: Then no further questions , you honor .
JUDGE FULLBRIGHT: Any re-cross from the defense ?
MICK: A moment with my staff , Judge ?
JUDGE FULLBRIGHT: Be quick .
LORNA: This is where I whisper in you ear , tell you stuff
MICK: It 's all here , right ? You go now , I do n't want anyone talking to you .
LORNA: Damn .
MICK: I do n't know what 's going on here , ut it wo n't matter if it 's two murders or a hundred if I can show he 's a liar
LOUIS: If you set me up I swear I 'll
MICK: Just tell me if there 's anything else he knows . Anything else I have to stay away from .
LOUIS: I do n't know because I never talked to him . I 'm not that stupid .
MICK: It does n't matter . If I destroy him none of it counts
LOUIS: Then destroy him .
MICK: Dwayne , if I can call you that
CORLISS: It 's what people call me
MICK: Do n't they also call you D.J. ? Fo example , down in Phoenix , right ?
CORLISS: Maybe .
MICK: Because you know , my assistant , she was just reading on the internet about D.J . Corliss arrested in Phoenix , 1989 on drug charges Hometown of Mesa , Arizona ?
CORLISS: Yeah , that 'd be me . But
MICK: You remember Fred Bentley , right ?
TED: I object , your honor , where is the defense going with this ?
JUDGE FULLBRIGHT: Connect the dots soon , Mr. Haller . But the witness can answer .
CORLISS: I do n't remember any Bentley
MICK: Sure you do . You testified that he confessed to you the crime he was charged with rape of a ten-year- old girl even though he denied his guilt in court . Am .I ringing any bells , D.J . ?
CORLISS: Uh 1989 , I was high a lot , there 's not much I recall
MICK: Then I 'd like you to read this to us , D.J . It 's a printout of a news story from the Arizona Star , 1997 , that 's eight years after he was convicted . I ask that it be admitted into evidence
TED: Your honor ? A news report ?
JUDGE FULLBRIGHT: Let 's see where it takes us . The state can object later .
MICK: I 've marked the paragraph .
CORLISS: I ai n't too good at reading `` A man , Frederick Bentley , wrongly convicted of rape , was released Saturday after con
HESITATES: conclusive DNA results cleared him of the crime . The case was olstered at trial by testimony from an informant , D.J . Corliss of Mesa , who claimed Bentley had agged to him about the rape while together in a holding cell ''
MICK: That 's enough . Were you charged with perjury fo that incident , D.J . ?
CORLISS: No I was not .
MICK: Was that because the police were complicit in your confession ?
TED: Judge , how can the witness know what went into the D.A . 's decision ?
MICK: Were you promised the same deal here , Mr. Corliss ? To say that Louis Roulet `` bragged '' to you in the `` holding cell ? ''
JUDGE FULLBRIGHT: Alright , Mr. Haller , that will do !
MICK: Sorry . I have no more questions . And Mick sits . Courtroom 's hushed . Until
JUDGE FULLBRIGHT: I 'm excusing the jury for an early lunch . Bailiff , see them out .
TED: Your honor , I
JUDGE FULLBRIGHT: You shut the fuck up when I 'm talking to you ! I can think of nothing more prejudicial or corrupt than what I just saw out therel Do you realize what you 've done to my trial ?
MICK: He 's going to see his boss . To decide what to do before the judge comes down with a directed verdict .
LOUIS: What 's a directed verdict ?
MICK: She takes it out of the jury 's hand and declares an acquittal .
MICK: We 'll know in a few minutes .
LOUIS: I 'm not celebrating just yet , Mick .
MICK: Yeah I can see that .
LOUIS: I want to know how Corliss got that shit he was saying .
MICK: Let it go . You 're getting what you want , I 'm getting you off
LOUIS: What I want is get off for good .
CLERK BILL: It 's starting .
TED: I just spoke to the District Attorney , your honor . The state wishes to dismiss all charges . Here 's a motion
JUDGE FULLBRIGHT: This is a motion to dismiss with prejudice . No coming back . Ever .
WITH DIFFICULTY: Yes , your honor .
MARY WINDSOR: Mr. Haller , thank you for my son
DOBBS: You were splendid
LOUIS: I knew I was n't wrong about you
MICK: I want the gun .
LOUIS: Of course you do .
MARY WINDSOR: Mr. Haller , this time I insist you come to Orso for a celebration

LOUIS: Mick ? This should n't be happening .
MARY WINDSOR: No ! Take your hands off my son !
LOUIS: Mother .
DOBBS: What are you arresting him for ?
KURLEN: Suspicion of murder . The murder of Martha Renteria .
DOBBS: That snake-dancer nonsense ? Are you crazy ? Everything that man Corliss said was a lie ! Which stops Kurlen . He grins , confirmed .
KURLEN: If it was all lies , how 'd you know I meant the snake dancer ?
MICK: A moment with my client , Detective ?
LOUIS: You 're forgetting I have the gun
MICK: Yeah , and you 'll have to explain how you got it . But you know what ? I 've stopped giving a shit . You 're going down , and Martinez is getting out , and that 's all I care about .
LOUIS: And what if I do n't go down ?
MICK: Please tell me you 've got enough on Louis for the murder of Renteria .
SOBEL: We will . We have the ticket .
MICK: What ticket ?
SOBEL: The parking ticket , that Raul found . That was the phone message he left you Raul checked . Louis got one at a meter outside the victim 's place , same time she was murdered .

LEONOR: Yes . I sent the girl home early so we could talk . You want to go inside ? I 'm just going to finish this .
BRIAN: The store looks nice .
LEONOR: Thanks . I did a lot of work here .
BRIAN: The reason why I 'm here , Leonor
LEONOR: I know .
BRIAN: Your lease has been expired fo more than six months now . I guess you guys were about to renew it when my father passed ?
LEONOR: Brian , why do n't you sit down .
BRIAN: My sister and I are working on the transfer of ownership for the house . It 's almost done ; Dad left everything in order , all the taxes paid and all that . The only thing still pending is the store , which needs to have a new lease . Shooting Script 07/27/15 56 .
LEONOR: You know , your father never thought much about contracts . He was very happy to have me here . Max thought my store gave `` glamour '' to the neighborhood , and he was proud to e associated .
BRIAN: The situation has changed , and now we have two families owning the house ; mine and Audrey 's . It 's etter for us , and for you , to have things done the right way , would n't you agree ?
LEONOR: It depends on what the right way is for you .
BRIAN: Leonor , this neighborhood is changing very fast . The rents have gone up quite a lot in the past few years . I 'm sure you 've noticed .
LEONOR: Yes , I noticed and so did Max . But it was his desire that I stay here .
BRIAN: We do n't want you to go away . My sister Audrey has prepared a new lease for you , and we think it 's very fair . We are n't trying to get market rate here , we know that 's not possible , but still , you ca n't expect to pay the same rent you paid when you first moved in . Brian pulls some papers out of his bag .
LEONOR: Before we go any further with this conversation , I want you to take a look at this .
BRIAN: That 's a ridiculous thing to say .
LEONOR: You hardly talked to each other . You never came to visit . I was the one here . I saw him everyday .
BRIAN: This is not what I came here for . Why do n't we go back to the lease . Take a look , please . It 's fair .
LEONOR: No , I do n't need to . I have an idea what you and your sister have in mind . I 'll just give this to my lawyer because , to be honest with you , Brian , I 'm not sure I owe you anything . Maybe it 's the other way around .
BRIAN: Well , I guess there 's not that much more to be said then .
LEONOR: No . Brian walks to the door , and out .
BRIAN: Goodnight , Leonor . Leonor says nothing .
KATHY: Brian . Want to help me out here ?
BRIAN: Sure , but just give me a moment .
KATHY: What 's wrong ?
JAKE: Hi Dad !
TONY: Hi , Mr. J .
BRIAN: Jake , you know it 's a weekday . What are you doing playing video games ? !
JAKE: Can Tony stay and eat with us ?
BRIAN: No . Shooting Script 07/27/15 59 .
JAKE: Why not ? He wanted to ask you about your acting career .
BRIAN: That 's enough for tonight . Turn it off .
JAKE: Dad , c'mon !
BRIAN: I said no .
TONY: We 're about to finish the level .
BRIAN: Tony , you need to go home now . We can talk about acting another time .
TONY: Sure , Mr. J .
BRIAN: I 'm sorry , buddy . Your mother is waiting for you downstairs .
KATHY: Did you ask your mother ?
TONY: She loves when Jake comes over .
JAKE: Please , Mom ? Please ?
KATHY: Jake I just made dinner .
JAKE: I 'll eat it tomorrow for lunch , I promise .
KATHY: Okay . But I want you back here in the morning .
JAKE: Yes ! Thanks .
TONY: Thank you , Mrs. Jardine . They run out of the apartment
LEONOR: No , Antonio .
TONY: C'mon , Mami . We have spaghetti in the fridge .
LEONOR: When I say no I mean it . Do n't ask me again . Shooting Script 07/27/15 61 .
TONY: But we 're going to be super quiet ! Are n't we , Jake ?
JAKE: Yes we are .
LEONOR: Antonio . No . Listen to me and do n't argue .
JAKE: It 's okay Tony . I 'll see you tomorrow . Leonor begins to walk away .
LEONOR: Goodnight , Jake .
JAKE: Goodnight , Mrs. Calvelli .
TONY: See you tomorrow .
JAKE: Yeah , see you tomorrow .
TONY: I 'm not talking to my mothe anymore .
JAKE: Why not ?
TONY: She said you ca n't come over to ou place . It 's not right .
JAKE: Why does n't she want me over ?
TONY: I do n't think your father wants me around very much anymore either . He might be too chicken to come out and say it , but I can tell .
JAKE: Why are they so mad at us ?
TONY: Our parents are involved in a usiness matter and it 's getting ugly . So they 're taking it out on us .
JAKE: You 're right . My dad was very cold to you .
TONY: You 'd think I was the enemy .
JAKE: I wo n't talk to my parents eithe then . The opponents head towards Tony and the goal . Shooting Script 07/27/15 63 .
TONY: Really ?
JAKE: Really . Not unless they apologize .
UMAR: Tony ! C'mon ! ! Are you playing o what ? Tony looks at Jake .
TONY: You sure you can handle it ? It wo n't be easy .
JAKE: Of course I can handle it . Tony returns his focus to the game .
TONY: You 're a great friend , Jake .
JAKE: You too .
BRIAN: Hey . Jake 's eyes remain glued to his drawing .
KATHY: It 's not your fault .
BRIAN: But I feel very responsible . We are esponsible .
KATHY: Audrey will tell you if she thinks you owe her money . Do n't worry about it .
BRIAN: She sort of did already .
KATHY: What ?
BRIAN: She told me we owe her money fo the store .
KATHY: Incredible . Kathy ca n't believe this .
BRIAN: Yes , I know .
KATHY: Jake . Did you see Leonor today ?
BRIAN: No . She hands Jake the bowl of salad .
KATHY: You know , you ca n't go on with this forever . Jake starts helping himself .
BRIAN: No .
KATHY: He 's been doing a lot of mythological stuff .
BRIAN: Is that inspired by that book I gave you ?
KATHY: Truth is , if he 's really serious about applying to LaGuardia , he 's going to need to start preparing a serious portfolio , no ?
BRIAN: Yes . From what I remember , only 2 % of the students who apply to LaGuardia get accepted . This means two out of a hundred . Twenty out of a thousand . They 're not just looking for talent ; they 're looking for serious commitment .
KATHY: And you famously flunked .
BRIAN: I did n't `` flunk '' !
KATHY: Hello . Shooting Script 07/27/15 67 .
BIANCA: Hi . Can I help you with anything ?
KATHY: Thanks . I 'm looking for Leonor . Oh , I see her .
LEONOR: Hi . Just a second , let me just me finish this .
KATHY: Monday .
LEONOR: Right . Your day off . Oh , you have to see this new dress . Bianca , show her the new dress ! The green one .
BIANCA: Remember the original wrap dress , the first one that Diane von Furstenberg made ?
KATHY: Of course . Wow , that 's an original ?
BIANCA: No , we found this fabric , it 's vintage fabric . And Leonor made the dress herself . Shooting Script 07/27/15 68 .
KATHY: It 's beautiful . Wow . But it 's eally not my style . Thank you . I need to talk to Leonor .
LEONOR: I made it . The fabric is vintage .
KATHY: Yes . I really like it , but I ca n't wear anything too tight on the waist these days . I need to lose a few pounds first .
LEONOR: I have to finish this for a client tonight .
KATHY: Tony is still not talking ?
LEONOR: No . Not a word to me yesterday .
KATHY: Same with Jake .
LEONOR: It 's very annoying .
KATHY: The one good thing , I have to say , is that Jake has been drawing and painting more than ever .
LEONOR: Is that good ? Shooting Script 07/27/15 69 .
KATHY: Yes ! If he really wants to apply to LaGuardia , he needs to prepare a portfolio . Is Tony still planning on applying also ?
LEONOR: How would I know ? It 's been fou days and he has n't said a word to me .
KATHY: Listen , Leonor , you know that I 'm trained in conflict resolution , so I 'm hoping I can help here , help settle this problem between you and our family .
LEONOR: Oh really ? Has your husband asked you to do that ?
KATHY: No . And by the way , he 's been working really hard . I 'm not sure you know that , but he 's rehearsing for a new play .
LEONOR: No . I have n't seen your husband .
KATHY: I know he 's been waiting to hea from you . Leonor does n't respond .
LEONOR: Shh . Not here . Shooting Script 07/27/15 70 .
KATHY: I know you think we 're the rich people coming into this neighborhood , but the truth is Brian has n't made any money in years . I 've been supporting this family with my hard work .
LEONOR: That 's not my problem .
KATHY: I know it 's not . I 'm just trying to talk about it .
LEONOR: You think talking is going to solve all your problems , do n't you ? You think you can use some of you psychology class tricks and just wash away the dirt here ? That dirt is my sweat , sweetie . It 's my life . It 's not going to be that easy .
KATHY: I know that . What I want to tell you is we will give you time , but we need this money . We need the shop to cover its rent . That 's not an unfair thing to ask of a tenant .
LEONOR: But I 'm not a tenant . To Max I was more than a tenant . I was family . I elong here . And before you go any further ; let me ask you do you know how much work I 've done here ? The tile floors ? The marble athroom ? That office in the back ? I paid for all that .
TONY: You look like you 've been doing this acting thing forever .
JULIA: Really ?
TONY: Like when you did the Emotional Recall exercise , it just seems so natural , I ca n't explain .
JULIA: You know , my father was a stunt man when I was a kid . So I spent a lot of time on sets and stuff .
TONY: So you have been doing this forever .
JULIA: No , because when I was eight years old he died .
TONY: Did he die doing a stunt ?
JULIA: No ! He had throat cancer .
TONY: Oh . I 'm sorry for your loss . Eva comes out of the School , and joins Julia .
JULIA: I 'll see you later ?
TONY: I hope so . She and Eva leave together , as Tony watches .
JAKE: No , why ?
TONY: I would do anything to see her in a ikini . Can you imagine ?
JAKE: I never thought about that .
TONY: So what about you ? Who do you like ?
JAKE: They 're all very nice .
TONY: You can tell me , you know .
JAKE: Tell you what ?
TONY: If you like someone . Jake keeps sketching in his book .
JAKE: I do n't know .
TONY: That 's what you always say .
JAKE: Well I do have an idea you might like .
TONY: What ?
JAKE: Eva talked about going dancing . There 's a matinee club , like afte hours , for kids .
TONY: When is it ?
JAKE: Sunday afternoon , in the City . Shooting Script 07/27/15 73 .
TONY: Let 's go !
JAKE: It would be fun , right ?
TONY: That would be perfect . If I can just dance with her
LEONOR: Your father .
NICK: Tony ! Whoa , man , watch out buddy .
LEONOR: C'mon , Antonio . You 're not going to talk to your father ?
NICK: Did the cat get your tongue ?
LEONOR: You forget he 's too old for this kind of joke .
NICK: What happened ?
LEONOR: He 's mad at his mother .
NICK: What about ?
LEONOR: Ask him . Tony looks at them both ; he 's not budging .
NICK: Tony , now that I 'm here you 're not going to say anything to me ?
LEONOR: Go finish your homework , Antonio . We 're having dinner soon .
NICK: So what are you going to do , Leonor ?
LEONOR: I do n't know yet , but Hernàn is helping me out .
NICK: Hernàn ? Is n't he a bankruptcy lawyer ?
LEONOR: Yes . Shooting Script 07/27/15 75 .
NICK: Is he the best person for this ?
LEONOR: He 's my friend . He knows strategy .
NICK: Are we talking about an exit strategy ?
LEONOR: No . A fighting strategy .
NICK: But you should have an exit plan .
LEONOR: I intend to fight . They ca n't do this to me .
NICK: What if they can ?
LEONOR: What do you want me to say , Nick ? That I 'm going to open a drug store ? Start making furniture ?
NICK: Or look for a job ?
LEONOR: You ca n't be serious .
NICK: Do n't take everything so personally , Leonor . The world is n't always stacked up against you .
LEONOR: What does this have to do with anything ?
NICK: Rent goes up . That 's life in this city . These people are not doing this to you . Shooting Script 07/27/15 76 .
LEONOR: Why do you always have to disagree with me ?
NICK: I 'm not disagreeing with you .
LEONOR: Ca n't you be on my side for once in your life ?
NICK: I 'm just being realistic . Life here is expensive . I think you should have a plan .
LEONOR: What do you think I 'm doing ? Do you think this is easy for me ?
NICK: I know it 's not .
LEONOR: That store is how I have raised ou son . With not much help from you , thank you very much .
NICK: That 's not true .
LEONOR: Really ? Do you think that sending him a little gift at the end of the year is enough to keep him fed ? To uy him clothes ? To take him to a movie every so often ?
NICK: Can we not talk about money now ? Damn , Leonor . You spoil everything . I ca n't even eat .
AUDREY: Well , Dad must have really liked her . That part I think she 's probably right about . He neve aised the rent on the store . Not even once in more than eight years . And now Leonor 's lawyer is charging us for improvements she made in the store .
BRIAN: What does that mean ?
AUDREY: She wants to fight . The woman is trouble , Brian . Once again , ou warm , lovable , unwise father left us with a big mess , and no instructions . They both take that in .
BRIAN: No , it 's not terrible . It 's sad , ut I do n't blame you .
AUDREY: Do you miss him ?
BRIAN: Sometimes . But I live in his house , so I probably think about him more than you do .
AUDREY: She 's claiming she has the right to stay paying almost nothing . I think we should start the eviction process as soon as possible .
BRIAN: I do n't want to have to do that . Shooting Script 07/27/15 79 .
AUDREY: It takes a while , you know .
BRIAN: I just do n't want this to get ugly . The boys are best friends now .
AUDREY: Remember that Dad worked very hard to leave us something . Now you have a nice big apartment , and I 'm getting nothing .
BRIAN: Just give me a little more time .
AUDREY: I ca n't do this without you , you know .
TONY: Hey , do you want to come with me to the beach ? Julia has a hard time hearing him .
JULIA: No , Tony . You 're really nice and everything , but I 'm into olde guys . Tony 's legs slow down , he loses his rhythm .
TONY: Oh , okay . Thank you for being honest .
JULIA: What ?
TONY: Thank you for being honest .
BRIAN: Do you want some more ?
KATHY: Sure .
BRIAN: I think it 's going to be great . I love my part , I love the actors , the play is fantastic .
KATHY: I 'll toast to that . They make a toast , but Brian seems tense .
BRIAN: Did you see the sign Leonor has posted in the window ?
KATHY: No , I did n't see anything .
BRIAN: She does n't acknowledge the new lease , she does n't try to negotiate and she has no plans of leaving . And now she 's actually hiring new people , can you believe it ?
KATHY: I told you this was n't going to be easy .
BRIAN: Audrey wants to start an eviction process . She has a lawyer ready to go already . Shooting Script 07/27/15 82 .
KATHY: Good . Then it 's decided .
BRIAN: Is it ? Kathy takes a sip .
KATHY: Who 's going to tell Jake ?
BRIAN: I will . It 's my problem .
KATHY: Well then tell him soon . Please .
BRIAN: He 's just being so childish lately .
NINA: What are you writing ?
ARKADINA: Boris ! Where are you ?
NINA: It is a dream !
ROGER: It 's in your delivery . It 's very natural . You really manage to make Trigorin feel contemporary .
BRIAN: Well , thank you , Roger .
ROGER: He 's like one of those famous artists we meet at a party , you know ? You 're excited at first , but the minute you start a conversation , you 're begging not to e left alone with the guy . Shooting Script 07/27/15 84 .
BRIAN: Is that a good thing ?
ROGER: Yes !
KATHY: He 's such a tormented artist . It 's wonderful .
ROGER: And there were some really funny parts too .
BRIAN: Is n't it ! Chekhov called it a comedy in four acts .
ROGER: Act two , particularly .
BRIAN: It is .
ROGER: Bye Kathy . Great to see you .
KATHY: Loved seeing you , Roger . It 's been a great night . He high fives with the boys , on his way out .
ROGER: Bye fellas . You should be very proud of this man here !
BRIAN: So ? Jake and Tony smile . Shooting Script 07/27/15 85 .
KATHY: Jake ? It 's your dad 's opening night .
BRIAN: Did you understand why Nina says she 's the seagull ? Jake shakes his head yes , Tony shakes his no .
KATHY: Brian . They 're kids . To be honest , I 'm not even sure I get that part .
BRIAN: Do either of you care about anyone other than yourselves ?
KATHY: Brian
BRIAN: God damn it ! !
LEONOR: Dresses go over there , on that rack on the left . Before you hang them , make sure they have a price tag . Also , try to arrange them by color , or tone . I usually like to start with lighter colors in the front , and end with darker ones . Black goes in the back . The women here like black a lot , so if they 're looking for a little black dress , they might see a lot of other stuff efore they get there .
VALENTINA: I see . So if they do n't know what they want , I try to keep them here in the front first , and then show them the ones in the back .
LEONOR: Unless they ask specifically fo lack .
VALENTINA: Hello . Can I help you ?
LEONOR: It 's okay , Valentina . It 's for me . This is Brian Jardine , ou neighbor . He 's a great actor .
VALENTINA: Oh really ? Have I seen you in anything ?
BRIAN: I doubt it .
LEONOR: He 's in a new play . What is it called ?
BRIAN: The Seagull .
LEONOR: Oh . That must be very popular .
BRIAN: Can you give me five minutes alone ? Please ?
LEONOR: The day your father died , he came y in the morning . I asked him to uy me a pack of cigarettes , and then I never saw him again .
BRIAN: Only my wife . I 'm a lot like Jake . I 've never been good at having close friends . Leonor takes another drag .
LEONOR: I ca n't afford to pay three times the rent I paid your father . It 's not possible . I ca n't survive . Brian does n't respond .
BRIAN: I am in a new play . But it 's not ig , and it 's not a lot of money . It 's just the way it is , Leonor . I 'm fortunate enough to have had a father who left me a house in Brooklyn .
LEONOR: He wanted me to stay here . He told me so .
BRIAN: Leonor . I also have a sister , and she has her own family , and we all have to decide together what to do . It 's not just up to me .
LEONOR: You know your father thought you sister was the one who inherited his brains . Brian does n't know how to respond . Shooting Script 07/27/15 89 .
BRIAN: They were very much alike . I 'm sure he would agree with Audrey that , above everything , it 's important to take care of business .
LEONOR: No . He would n't have agreed . I can promise you that .
BRIAN: Leonor , what do you want me to say ? I have a family . We have bills too .
LEONOR: Do you know why your father did n't go to your son 's birthday party , the last one ?
BRIAN: He had the flu .
LEONOR: No . That 's maybe what he told you . The truth is , he was embarrassed , Brian . He was embarrassed that everything in your house was paid for by your wife . He thought you should be more of a man . He hated eing around you .
BRIAN: Well , he 's not around anymore , is he .
LEONOR: He certainly is n't .
HERNÀN: This Holdover clause is common in any commercial lease .
LEONOR: What am I going to do ? I ca n't afford this .
HERNÀN: I 'm sorry , Leonor . He takes the paper from Leonor 's hands .
LEONOR: Where do they even get this number ? Her eyes fill up with angry tears .
HERNÀN: The penalty for overstaying may seem like a high number , and it is . That 's why it 's in the contract ; to prevent that the tenant overstays paying below the market rent indefinitely .
LEONOR: Is n't there anything else we can do ?
HERNÀN: Leonor , I 've done everything I can . It 's over now . You have a week to leave the premises .
TONY: Do n't worry , Mami . I 'm going to help you . I promise , I 'll figure out a way we can work it all out . He holds her as her crying turns into sobs .
BRIAN: Yes , he 's doing his homework .
TONY: I 'd like to talk to him if I could .
BRIAN: Of course , Tony . Come in . Leonor catches his eye .
KATHY: You sure I ca n't get you something , Leonor .
LEONOR: Yes , I 'm fine .
JAKE: Mom ! Dad ! Mom ! !
BRIAN: He talks ! Jacob talks !
JAKE: Mom ! ! !
KATHY: What 's going on ? !
JAKE: Mom , Tony told me Leonor is being evacuated from the store !
KATHY: It 's not an evacuation . It 's an eviction .
JAKE: That 's worse !
BRIAN: It 's a terrible situation .
JAKE: The rent is too expensive ! She ca n't afford it , Mom . So Dad needs to give her a discount so she can !
BRIAN: Your mother and I wanted to talk to you , Jake , but this not talking did n't help ! Shooting Script 07/27/15 93 .
KATHY: Do n't blame this on him .
JAKE: It 's okay , I 'm talking now ! I 'm sorry ! I 'm sorry ! I 'll never do that again . I promise . Dad , I promise .
BRIAN: Jake , calm down .
JAKE: I have a great idea .
BRIAN: Let me explain to you , Jake . Grandpa Max left this house not just for the three of us here .
JAKE: I know . He loved Leonor too . Tony told me !
BRIAN: He liked Leonor , of course , but he left the house for us , and also fo Aunt Audrey .
JAKE: But I have an idea ! I know how we can make it work ! We go back to ou old apartment , and we rent this place and give the money to Aunt Audrey . Tony and I are both going to be at the LaGuardia High School for Performing Arts in Manhattan , so I wo n't need to take the subway or anything to school . I can walk . And you 'll be closer to the theater . I loved the show , Dad . I loved it . Tony did too . We both talked about it a lot afterwards . You were so good ! And I thought it was really complex and everything . I 'm sorry I did n't tell you then . I 'm sorry . But I loved it . I really did !
PARK RANGER: Mr. Jardine ?
BRIAN: How are you , Son ?
JAKE: I 'm sorry , Dad .
BRIAN: What happened ?
JAKE: There was a bump on the path
PARK RANGER: We got a call from a woman who saw Jake here flying through the ai and landing on the asphalt . When we found him , he could n't move .
JAKE: I 'm better now .
PARK RANGER: He is better . But he probably should n't be on his own at his age .
JAKE: There was a bump , I did n't see .
BRIAN: Are you hurt ? Jake shrugs . Shooting Script 07/27/15 96 .
PARK RANGER: He fell on his right side shoulder , and he scraped his knee .
BRIAN: Let 's go home .
KATHY: Is it okay like this ?
JAKE: Yeah . Go slow .
KATHY: And how 's your arm ? Can you move it okay ?
JAKE: It hurts when I go like this .
BRIAN: Dad had a heating pad that he used to use . I ca n't find it . You know where it is ?
KATHY: I think it 's in the hall closet . I 'll get it in a minute .
BRIAN: Do you still have a lot to do to finish your portfolio ? Shooting Script 07/27/15 97 .
JAKE: I just need to finish one painting , and then I 'm done .
BRIAN: That 's what you said last week . You just had to finish one painting .
JAKE: I want them to be good .
BRIAN: Jake , do you by any chance remembe that story I told you , about my friend Tina ?
JAKE: The one who sold her hair in India for a train ticket ?
BRIAN: No , that was Martine . Tina was a girl I knew in high school who was a dancer . Her mother was a dancer . She was literally born to be a dancer . She had a perfect ballet dancer 's body , and all of us were certain she was going to be a big success .
JAKE: Have I seen her dance ?
BRIAN: No . During high school , she got into a really good conservatory , and I ran into her a couple of times after that , and she was always about to get this , or about to get that . But each time , her arm would be in a sling , or she would e on crutches . She would have a pulled ligament . Or a stress fracture in her back . The last time I saw her , I ran into her on the subway , it was clear she had n't danced for years . She was fat . You would have never imagined that she was the same girl .
JAKE: Gee , thanks Dad . That 's a very encouraging story . Shooting Script 07/27/15 98 .
BRIAN: Why do you think Tina did n't go very far ?
JAKE: I do n't know .
BRIAN: She trained too hard . She practiced too much . She did n't trust her own natural abilities . He continues to wrap the bandage .
JAKE: And how do I know if I have the alance ?
BRIAN: That 's why I 'm telling you this , ecause you 'll turn in you portfolio soon , and they 're going to love it . They 're going to love you . I know they will . You 'll go to LaGuardia , and you 'll have fun , but also plenty of challenges . Soon enough you 'll find out if you have the balance . The bandage is done .
JAKE: I do n't know . I do n't know what he 's doing . Brian looks at Jake .
BRIAN: Son . I wish I 'd done things differently . Shooting Script 07/27/15 99 .
JAKE: What do you mean ?
BRIAN: With Tony , and his mother . I wish I had told you earlier what was going on .
JAKE: Would it have changed anything ?
BRIAN: No , probably not . But still .
JAKE: Dad , would you mind if I give you some advice ? Would that be okay .
BRIAN: Please .
JAKE: Do n't worry so much . Brian waits for more .
BRIAN: That 's a lot .
JAKE: Dad , would you mind if I play one of my video games ? I know it 's Tuesday , and I know I should do something more productive with my time , but I 'm kind of tired .
BRIAN: Of course , Son .
JAKE: Will Mom be mad ?
BRIAN: I do n't think so . Shooting Script 07/27/15 100 .
JAKE: Yours looks different too .
TONY: I went to Africa to visit my dad .
JAKE: How was it ?
TONY: Amazing .
JAKE: And how 's your mom ? Shooting Script 07/27/15 102 .
TONY: She 's busy . She 's a real estate agent now .
JAKE: You could 've sent me an email from Africa .
TONY: You know me . I 'm not much of a writer
JAKE: I love that necklace .
TONY: Thanks . They make these fo tourists , they do n't really wea them there . But I like it too .
JAKE: Hey , you should come meet my uddies from school .
TONY: Did you get into LaGuardia ?
JAKE: I did .
TONY: That 's awesome !
JAKE: There 's this girl in my class , he mother is on Broadway , she can act etter than anyone I know .
TONY: Gee , thanks .

SCOTTIE: Who is this ?
PEEPER: Just a little birdie . A birdie who wants to see if your mother 's panties match her bra .
MOTHER: Oh my G-D Scottie . Is there a man up our tree ? The peeper gets nervous .
PEEPER: Tell her no . Tell her it 's just a big ird .
PEEPER: Am I in hell ?
GATEKEEPER: What do you think ?
NICKY: Hey
CASSIUS: I knew it . He 's finally retiring .
ADRIAN: I 've been waiting on this day for ten thousand years .
HUMAN DARTBOARD: Aaaah !
CASSIUS: If the old man picks me to take ove Hell , I 'll keep the torture going twenty four seven . No breaks .
ADRIAN: Well Dad says it 's the breaks that make the torture . You have to let people feel a sense of relief .
HUMAN DARTBOARD: Aaaaaaaaaaaah !
ADRIAN: Then again , the beauty of Dad retiring is what he says does n't matter anymore .
CASSIUS: I 'll take that .
HUMAN DARTBOARD: Was that really necessary ? Nicky enters sheepishly .
CASSIUS: Hey , how 's Daddy 's little girl doing today ?
NICKY: Good , thanks . Cassius snaps his fingers in Nicky 's face .
CASSIUS: Hey . Hey . Hey . Wan na mind wrestle ? Cassius ' eyes start glowing red .

CASSIUS: Got ya , again !
NICKY: Got me for sure , yes
CASSIUS: Got ya ! Now here 's the big finish
NICKY: Oh no . Please Cassius
DAD: What are you boys doing ? Cassius releases Nicky 's hand .
NICKY: Nothing , Dad . Just re-arranging the furniture .
DAD: Cassius , did n't I tell you to stay out of your brother 's mind ?
CASSIUS: I forgot .
DAD: Maybe this will help you remember .
NICKY: Hey , Dad , I 'm almost finished laying down my monsters of metal compilation tape . I really think it 's a masterpiece .
DAD: Okay , kid , we 'll listen to it later .
NICKY: Do n't worry about coming up with anything . It 's cool .
DAD: Such a sweet boy . But after much thought and careful consideration , I 've decided that the ruler for the next ten thousand years is going to have to eme .
NICKY: Hallelujah . They all look at Nicky .
DAD: The important thing for the stability of our rule is to maintain the balance etween good and evil . And I do n't think any of you are ready for that esponsibility yet . You need the wisdom that comes only with the passage of time .
CASSIUS: Dad ! This is Hoyashit .
DAD: Right . Right . Send him in . I 'm sorry , boys . I 've got to get back to work .
ADRIAN: You sure about this decision , Dad ?
DAD: I 'm telling you , pal , it 's the right thing to do .
HITLER: Holy schnit ! !
CASSIUS: You work your ass off for ten thousand years , hurting people , helping others hurt people , then you get a decision like that .
ADRIAN: And he 's dead serious .
CASSIUS: It 's just such a slap in the face . Adrian turns to the Monster .
ADRIAN: Um , excuse me , we 're having a private conversation here .
CASSIUS: Yeah , get out of here ! Beat it !
ADRIAN: Twenty-thousand years ago , Grandpa Lucifer said , `` It is better to rule in hell than serve in heaven . '' Well , I 'm getting tired of serving in Hell . We need a place where we can rule .
CASSIUS: Oh you wan na be a big man ? Bring it on ! ! Let 's see what you got !
ADRIAN: Could you concentrate for five seconds ?
CASSIUS: I am concentrating . Where can we rule ?
ADRIAN: What do you think aboutEarth ? Cassius seems to think this is n't a bad idea .
CASSIUS: You saying we go up there and kill everyone ?
ADRIAN: Eventually , Cassius . But first we corrupt as many as we can so that when we do destroy them
CASSIUS: their damned souls will be ours .
ADRIAN: It 's our time , brother .
GATEKEEPER: Hey , what are you doing ? ! ? They get closer to the fire .
DAD: Now that was an experience . `` You are only coming through in waves . '' That line blows my mind every time .
NICKY: Definitely .
DAD: I do n't care what kind of mood you 're in at the start of that song . When it 's over , that mood has been altered . Wow . Great shit . What 's next ?
NICKY: Well , I thought that after messing with your head , I 'd give you a little kick in the keester .
DAD: Who is this , Metal-lick-a ?
NICKY: Metallica , Dad . Come on .
DAD: I was just playing with you . Dad and Nicky dance to the song .
DAN: C'mon , man , I 'm just asking for one Superbowl ring .
DAD: In exchange for eternal damnation of your soul ? You 're too nice of a guy fo me to want to do that to you , Mr. Marino .
DAN: You did it for Namath .
DAD: Yeah , but Joe was coming here anyways . Just go back to Earth and enjoy you ecords and the Hall of Fame and the eautiful family and all that .
DAN: This is bullshit , man . I 'm gon na win the Superbowl this year , with or without you !
DAD: Now you 're talking . Dan exits .
NICKY: You 're a good devil , Dad .
DAD: And I also happen to be a Jets fan .
GATEKEEPER: Your highness , Cassius and Adrian have escaped from hell . They went through the fire , and they broke it . I think they took the New York tunnel . I tried to stop them , but they overpowered me , sir .
DAD: Oh , boy . Oh boy . Calm down . Get off your knees . The Gatekeeper stands up .
GATEKEEPER: Thanks for being so understanding , you worship . You 're the man . You 've always een the man .
NICKY: Coulda been much worse .
GATEKEEPER: That 's what I 'm thinkin ' Dad is staring off . He looks shaken .
DAD: This is bad , Nicky .
NICKY: How bad ?
DAD: I 'm gon na die , Nicky . If the gates are oken , no new souls can get in , which means I 'll start to deteriorate into nothing . GRANDPA LUCIFER enters .
LUCIFER: What 's with all the whoo-whoo noises ?
DAD: Everything 's fine , pop .
LUCIFER: Last time you said that the renaissance happened .
DAD: Please , pop , just go back to your room .
LUCIFER: Can I take him with me and have sex with his head ?
DAD: Sure , pop . Whatever you want . The gatekeeper walks towards Lucifer .
GATEKEEPER: Oh , this is gon na be a whole new lifestyle for me , is n't it .
NICKY: We got ta get this bad boy burning again . Ideas ?
DAD: To do that Cassius and Adrian have to come back through the other way .
NICKY: So go get 'em , Dad !
DAD: I 'm too weak . The process has already egun .
NICKY: So go get 'em , Jimmy !
DAD: Nicky , the worst thing that could happen on Earth is you get killed , in which case , boom , you end up back here .
NICKY: Are you telling me I have to go to Earth and kill my brothers ?
DAD: Here . Get them drunk from this . One sip and they 'll be trapped inside . Once you 've got both of them , you bring the flask back through the gate .
NICKY: No . This ca n't be happening .
DAD: Son , just do your best .
NICKY: Okay . Earth . The Blue Marble . This does n't look too bad .
DAD: That 's a train , son . Do n't stand in front of them .
NICKY: Well , I guess I 'm going to have to take a mulligan on this one .
DAD: Please , Nicky , get back up there . Try to hurry .
NICKY: I 'm Nicky . Beefy drops the sign from his mouth .
BEEFY: Hey , terrific ! ! Now get off the track and come with me , shitstains .
NICKY: I just need to find my brothers and be on my way , Beefy .
BEEFY: It 's not gon na be easy . Your brothers can possess people . So they probably wo n't look like themselves . You have to e suspicious of everyone . Nicky looks at Beefy warily for a beat .
NICKY: Okay , `` bro , '' this jig is up Just get in the bottle . Just slide ight on in there .
BEEFY: It 's not me , moron .
NICKY: Oh . Sorry .
PREACHER: Oh how the Lord loves you . All his children . He thanks you for your kindness . God bless , Ma'am . The Lord loves you The Lord loves you
BEEFY: Makin ' friends already .
NICKY: It 's freezing up here , Beefy .
BEEFY: You 're on Earth now , kid . Gon na have the same physical needs and limitations a human has . We 'll stop by K-mart . Get you some warm clothes .
NICKY: I also have this odd pain in my mid section . Kind of a hollow feeling
BEEFY: That pain is hunger .
NICKY: So far , so good . Now what ?
BEEFY: Put it in your mouth . Nicky puts it in his mouth . Holds it there .
NICKY: HeyPopeye 's chicken is ass kickin ' !
BEEFY: It sure is . Now eat it up . You 're gon na need your energy .
NICKY: I got energy up the ying-ying . Let 's get cracking !
GATEKEEPER: Hey .
NICKY: That 's a pretty brassiere .
GATEKEEPER: Thanks .
NICKY: Could you maybe not tell anyone about this ?
GATEKEEPER: You got it . Could you maybe not tell anyone about this ?
NICKY: You got it .
BEEFY: Great . Now your father gave me some deposit money for a nice pad on the Upper East Side . But I misplaced it .
TODD: I know exactly how you feel The night Reagan was elected , I said to my mother , `` Is this man going to blow up the world , Mommy ? '' Then we both cried for like an hour . Somebody 's here . Call you later .
NICKY: Hello , friend , my name is Nicky . I understand you 're seeking a roommate , as per your advertisement in the Village Voice . Would it be possible for me to fill the slot ?
TODD: Uh , do n't you want to know what the rent is ?
NICKY: Yes . What is rent ?
TODD: Eight-hundred , split down the middle . Tuesdays and Thursdays I rehearse with my scene partner so the living room will e off limits .
NICKY: Off limits .
TODD: Right . And as far as household items we can share the soap , but we 'll split the cost 60/40 . Cause the person who physically goes out and buys the soap should n't have to pay as much as the other guy . Are n't you boiling in that outfit ?
NICKY: No .
TODD: It 's like eighty degrees in this hallway . You from the South ?
NICKY: Yeah . The deep South . Nicky laughs a little too hard .
TODD: Why is that funny ?
NICKY: I do n't know .
TODD: And sorry , man , but no dogs allowed . Todd turns and goes into the apartment .
BEEFY: You 'll be alright . Go on . Big day tomorrow . Do n't forget to do that sleep thing I told you about .
NICKY: Got ya . Is it okay if I do the sleep thing ?
TODD: Yeah , your bedroom is right over there .
CARDINAL: In today 's gospel , the Lord tells us who we are to live if we wish to attain the splendor of Heaven or something like that . Jesus sure says a lot of stuff in the Bible . Moses this . Moses that . Abraham hit me with a whiffle ball bat .
YOUNG MAN: After we tried for many years , the Lord finally helped my wife conceive a baby .
CARDINAL: No , your best friend Fitzie helped you wife conceive a baby . He helped he conceive it all night long .
MAYOR: Well , I wish I could think of something , Cardinal , but to be honest with you , I ca n't . Kind of makes you wonder if there even is a Lord . If there is any ultimate punishment for our so-called `` sins . '' Maybe we should all just have fun and do whatever the hell we want .
CARDINAL: Amen to that . Let the sin begin !
NICKY: This is intense ! And it happens every day ? Sometimes twice ? I got ta tip my hat to you people !
BEEFY: Look , it 's okay for me to shit the street . But you got ta use a toilet .
NICKY: Okay , just point me in the right direction next time .
BEEFY: Come on , there 's like ten million people in this city and the clock is ticking .
NICKY: Well , let 's rock and roll .
GATEKEEPER: Bus ?
NICKY: Beast . The Monster laughs .
GATEKEEPER: You like that ? You think that 's funny ? The Gatekeeper swirls his tassels .
NICKY: All that running and chasing is making the sleep thing want to come early .
BEEFY: I think we have to work on narrowing down our list of suspects . Now I 'm going to go check in with some of my contacts uptown .
PETER: Sounds like our devil dance actually worked this time .
JOHN: 'Bout time
PETER: Mr. Sleepyhead must have some major ties to the dark side .
JOHN: What 's with that guy ?
PETER: Got ta be one of his disciples o something .
JOHN: Yo , man , I think that devil guy just got ipped off .
PETER: Should we wake him up ?
JOHN: Yeah . You do it .
PETER: Rise and shine , devil guy . Some dude just stole your shit . Nicky feels for the flask . It 's gone .
NICKY: Oh nooooo . Fire shoots out of Nicky 's mouth .
JOHN: That way .
NICKY: Iron Maiden live double disc is simply phenomenal . He runs off .
PETER: Did you check out the dragon mouth ?
JOHN: The Dark Prince is here .
NICKY: Hey
STREET VENDOR: See something you like , my man ?
NICKY: Yes . I would like my flask back . The street vendor stands , very angry .
STREET VENDOR: You callin ' me a thief , my man ?
NICKY: No , I 'm just calling you a guy who has my flask .
STREET VENDOR: And if that is your so-called `` flask , '' how would I have it unless I was , in fact , a thief ?
NICKY: I do n't know ? A YUPPIE JOGGER is checking out the flask .
MAN: Yeah , how much for the silver flask there ?
STREET VENDOR: Well , that 's a very special item . The cap itself is one hundred percent plappium . It 's a value is over three thousand dollars .
MAN: Really . Where 's it from ?
NICKY: It was handcrafted in hell by Satan himself and is only to be used for the capture and containment of my blood others so that the firefall of Hades will burn brightly once again .
MAN: Really . I think we 'll let you keep it then . He walks away .
STREET VENDOR: Okay , now you gone and done it . You done messed with my business bitch !
NICKY: Sir , I would prefer if you did n't raise your voice . It 's making my muscles tighten .
STREET VENDOR: Oh , you gon na go all crazy eyes on me ? I 'll show you some crazy eyes . Let 's get busy .
VALERIE: Excuse me , does that flask belong to this man ?
STREET VENDOR: Now you callin ' me a thief ? Damn .
VALERIE: Look , I know you come out here and sell stolen stuff all the time . But today , the guy you stole from just happened to walk by and bust you . So why do n't you admit today 's not your day and give him his flask back ?
STREET VENDOR: Or what 're you gon na do about it ? Ugly me to death ?
VALERIE: No , but maybe that cop over there might have something to say .
STREET VENDOR: Aw , take your dumb-ass canteen , goofy . And you , take your raggedy-ass clothes and find a new corner . Before I show you what real crazy is . The vendor does crazy eyes again .
VALERIE: Fine . I will . Nicky picks up the flask and the drumstick .
NICKY: Hey , mister . I 'll be seeing you in a few years .
VALERIE: That 's okay . I get messed with all the time and when I saw him doing that to you I just lost it . I hate when people take advantage of tourists . It ruins it for the rest of us .
NICKY: You think I 'm a tourist ?
VALERIE: I 'm sorry . I just assumed . Your accent maybe . Where are you from ?
NICKY: The South .
VALERIE: Really ?
NICKY: Yeah . Deep south . She laughs along with him , not sure why .
VALERIE: Why are you laughing ?
NICKY: I do n't know , but I like it . Say . You glasses are nice . They make your eyes look sparkly and big . It 's fun to look at them .
VALERIE: My dad 's an optometrist .
NICKY: My dad 's in hell , and he 's falling apart .
VALERIE: I 'm sorry . It 's really tough when you parents get older .
NICKY: If I do n't save him , I do n't know what I 'm gon na do .
VALERIE: Well , I 'm sure a nice southern boy like you will figure something out .
NICKY: Here , have a Popeye 's . This drumstick ai n't for beatin ' it 's for eatin ' .
VALERIE: That 's alright . I already ate lunch . I actually would n't mind getting a Gelati .
NICKY: Could I come with you to getting a Gelati ?
VALERIE: If you want to .
NICKY: Want to ? A million angry octopus people could n't hold me back !
VALERIE: `` Octopus people ? ''
NICKY: Uh , it 's a deep south expression . Nicky laughs .
VALERIE: It 's not that cold . Here , let me wrap it .
PREACHER: Why do you taunt me with your darkness ? ! Your evil is stinking up our streets ! We 're all gon na die ! He takes off running right into a lamp post .
VALERIE: This town is really going to hell lately . So what part of the city do you live in ?
NICKY: I have an apartment . I do n't remembe exactly where . My dog knows , though .
VALERIE: You have a dog ? What kind ?
NICKY: I 'm not sure . I 'd ask him , but he 's uptown talking to his contacts .
BEEFY: Remember , it 's not the size of the boat , it 's the motion of the ocean .
GIRL DOG: Just finish .
VALERIE: I 'd love to have a dog . But I go to school full time . It would n't be fai to the dog .
NICKY: School ?
VALERIE: Parsons School of Design . I knew growing up I was n't much to look at , so I put my energy into making things that are pretty .
NICKY: What 's that pleasant smell coming from , your skin ?
VALERIE: My perfume ?
NICKY: Valerie , it feels like there 's a bunch of butterflies flapping around in my stomach . Is that normal ?
VALERIE: Sometimes , sure .
NICKY: Good . I was concerned .
GATEKEEPER: Does n't sound very good behind there . I hope Nicky 's kicking some ass on Earth .
LUCIFER: You know , I was the one who created Hell .
GATEKEEPER: I know , your wickedness .
LUCIFER: I started slow , though . For years , I was just giving people hot foots . Actually , you can give all the credit for Hell to my first wife ; she was the inspiration . She was an ugly one , too . One day , she asked me if I wanted supe sex . I said I 'll take the soup . The Monster laughs really hard .
GATEKEEPER: It 's Stanley , sir .
LUCIFER: Nothing . No mountains . No castles . Looked like a giant parking lot . It was n't even called Hell .
GATEKEEPER: What was it called , sir .
LUCIFER: Boogerland !
GATEKEEPER: That 's nice , Grandpa . Why do n't you just enjoy the fishing ?
LUCIFER: I ca n't enjoy anything . I go fishing . I catch nothing . I go to orgies , I catch everything
PEEPER: I deserve this !
KID: I just stole twenty-five bucks off the ar .
KID #2: How many beers did you have ?
KID: I had five ! I 'm so wasted .
ADRIAN: When an adult goes to Hell , that 's terrific . But when a child goes that 's why I 'm in this business .
NICKY: So you 're saying , make all pants with a drawstring , then heavier set gals do n't have to feel humiliated by telling thei waist size in front of the whole store ?
VALERIE: Basically , yeah .
NICKY: Wow . Maybe you should make drawstring socks for gals with fat ankles . Valerie laughs .
VALERIE: You know what 's nice about you ? You just seem happy being yourself . You do n't try to act cool .
NICKY: Thanks much . You know what 's nice about you , Valerie ?
VALERIE: What ?
NICKY: Your juicy , heart-shaped ass .
VALERIE: What was that ?
NICKY: II do n't know why I just said that . I meant to say that
VALERIE: You 're a jerk .
PETER: Check this out . The number of the east . They laugh and hi-five .
DAN RATHER: Reverberations from Arch-Decon Donnelly 's shocking speech are still eing felt throughout the city . Today , some disgruntled cast members of the play CATS broke the fourth wall in a most hostile manner .
DAN RATHER: But even that does not come close to what happened today on Live with Regis and Kathy Lee .
REGIS: So I was driving to work today , and some ozo in a Cadillac cut me off
KATHY LEE: Oh , that 's terrible , Reege
REGIS: So I followed him
KATHY LEE: You followed him ?
REGIS: I followed him all the way downtown , and when he gets out of the car , I reach under my seat and pull out an aluminum at .
KATHY LEE: You keep a bat under your seat ?
REGIS: Recently , yes ! So I run up behind this guy , and start bashing his brains in with this bat , and it made me feel happy ! Did you ever see THE
KATHY LEE: Yes , great movie
REGIS: I was DeNiro !
BEEFY: Your brothers are upsetting the balance of good and evil .
NICKY: What can I do about it ?
BEEFY: You ca n't do jack shit unless you learn your evil powers .
NICKY: Nobody 's as evil as my brothers . Those dudes put the wick in wicked .
BEEFY: Go get a soda out of the fridge .
NICKY: But those are my roommate 's sodas
BEEFY: `` But those are my roommate 's sodas '' Does that sound like a statement the son of the devil would make ?
NICKY: Release the evil ?
BEEFY: I 'm just saying , there 's wickedness in you I can tell from your snores . Nicky stares at the can .
TODD: What are you doing ?
BILL WALTON: What an odd game , folks . The powerhouse 85-0 Harlem Globetrotters , who normal un circles around the 0-85 Nationals , seem to be struggling to find thei groove in front of their hometown fans .
REF: He 's walking , get him a bus !
BILL WALTON: Oh , another awful call . There is no way that was travelling .
CORNROWS: What 's with all these crazy calls ? You got ta watch that shit , we have n't lost a game in 53 years .
REF: Technical foul !
NICKY: That guy in the striped shirt snaps his fingers like someone I know
TODD: A black guy ?
NICKY: If it 's Cassius , yes . Nicky races for the door .
GLOBETROTTER FAN: Get your head out your ass , ref ! The kids came to see the Globetrotters win .
REF: Oh , so you wan na lip off to me ? Unsportsmanlike conduct on the big mouth in the Globetrotter 's shirt . Take ten points off for the Globetrotters .
BILL WALTON: In all my years of basketball , I was never so happy to hear a halftime uzzer . Folk , I 'm afraid if the second half does n't get any better , I expect a full scale riot .
COURT ANNOUNCER: It 's time for the Globetrotter 's halftime half-court heave throw , where one lucky fan will have a shot at ten thousand dollars ! A brick lands at the announcer 's feet .
MIGUEL: I ai n't goin ' out there and taking the shot . These people have gone crazy .
NICKY: I 'll take the shot .
PETER: Look who 's back from the dead .
JOHN: Six , six , six , pick up sticks .
TODD: What 's Nicky doing down there ?
BEEFY: Trying to capture his brother in a flask and preserve the balance of good and evil on Earth . Todd looks over , suspicious .
TODD: Did you just talk ?
BEEFY: No .
COURT ANNOUNCER: You better win these people some free pizza . Looks like they 're about to start killing each other .
NICKY: Release the evil .
BILL WALTON: I think that ball just blew up . And yes , my hair is aflame .
NICKY: Could I get another ball ?
REF: Get that crap outta here !
NICKY: Listen up , New York . Your souls are in great danger Nicky gets hit by a hot dog .
BILL WALTON: I think it 's safe to say we 're all ooting for this bizarre and hideous looking man .
CROWD: Nicky ! Nicky ! Nicky !
NICKY: You know , Dad got very sick when you left .
REF: I heard . I 'm glad he 's dying . It 's my turn now . Nicky 's eyes get red , he starts dribbling .
BEEFY: Take him to the hole , Nicky . I mean , woof ! Woof ! Todd looks at Beefy , terrified .
NICKY: Never doubt my skills .
CORNROWS: Damn , I got ta learn how to do that .
REF: That 's nuts . When 'd you learn that shit ?
NICKY: Sorry , Cassius . Maybe it was the supe devil juice Dad gave me . HE thought I might need it for just such an occasion .
REGIS: Super devil juice ? Give it over . Let 's go best two out of three .
NICKY: No . No way . Dad said it was only fo me . The ref rips the flask from Nicky and drinks .
TODD: So your father 's the devil , you 're a talking dog sent from Hell , and you guys are who ?
PEEPER: Just a couple of big fans of Nicky and the work his Dad does .
JOHN: By the way , Nicky . Check this out . He spins his Black Sabbath backwards .
NICKY: Absolutely nothing . The Blizzard always came straight with his messages . But wrap your minds around this one .
VOICE: I command you in the name of the Lucife to spread the blood of the innocent . John and Peter look at each other , shocked .
JOHN: No wonder your uncle 's so weird
TODD: I got ta say this cake tastes a little funny .
PETER: Oh , I dumped a fat sack of reefer in the mix . Tried to spice up the bash . Nicky takes a big bite of cake .
NICKY: What 's reefer ?
JOHN: Come on . One more time .
NICKY: Not again , fellas . It kind of hurts .
PETER: Please . You got to .
NICKY: All right
BEEFY: I used to get baked like this with my first girlfriend , Heather . We 'd get so stoned she would forget I was a dog .
JOHN: She was human ?
BEEFY: Actually , she was a sewer rat . Man , that pissed my parents off .
JOHN: I dated a Japanese girl once . My parents disapproved . Not cause she 's Japanese , but cause she was only fifteen .
NICKY: I 'm only fifteenthousand years old . Everyone cracks up .
TODD: I was in love one time but she said I was n't financially reliable enough . And she needed that .
JOHN: By she , do you mean he ?
TODD: No .
BEEFY: Busted .
PETER: How you feelin ' over there , Satan Abdul Jabar ?
NICKY: A little strange . I ca n't stop thinking about this girl , Valerie .
TODD: Why ? Did she hurt you ? Do you miss her ? Need a shoulder to cry on ?
JOHN: Easy , Liberace .
TODD: Oh , would you grow up .
NICKY: We had the greatest afternoon of my life until Adrian made me tell her she had a heart-shaped ass .
BEEFY: Maybe you love her . But what do I know ? I 'm baked out of my mind .
PETER: Me , too . We 're gon na get going .
TODD: You guys want to stay ? I have a futon in my bedroom .
JOHN: That 's a big pass , Elton John .
PETER: We 're going to see Ozzy play at the Meadowlands , right now . Wan na come , Nicky ?
NICKY: No thanks . I 'm afraid I would n't be able to give Ozzy the focus he deserves .
JOHN: Whoa , that chick must be the real deal , then . Later on .
NICKY: See ya , fellas . They leave .
TODD: That is the most frightening thing I have ever seen .
NICKY: Todd . Which way to the Parson 's School of Design ?
STUDENT: Hello .
NICKY: You smell like coconuts .
STUDENT: It 's `` Comptoir Sud Pacific . '' Makes me feel like a hula girl . Which is kinda what I 'm going for . Wan na come in ?
NICKY: No thanks . I 'm looking for a girl named Valerie who also smells like coconuts .
STUDENT: Valerie Doran ? Two floors up , one window over .
NICKY: Thanks , much . Good luck with the genital tucking .
STUDENT: I do n't need luck . I 'm good .
NICKY: Adrian ?
STUDENT: Andrew . Nicky nods and floats off .
NICKY: Hey .
VALERIE: Nicky ? Oh my G-d. Stay right there .
NICKY: Oh that stings ! My eyes are on fire ! Nicky stands up and stumbles around .
VALERIE: What were you thinking coming here ?
NICKY: I 'm not sure , but it did n't involve getting blinded with poison .
VALERIE: Oh my G-d , I 'm so sorry !
NICKY: Valerie ?
VALERIE: Are you dead ?
NICKY: No .
VALERIE: What are you doing ?
NICKY: I think I 'm floating .
VALERIE: Why would you be floating ?
NICKY: I do n't know . Maybe it 's because of your sweet voice .
VALERIE: Am I supposed to not be freaked out ight now ? Because I am . He 's floating up . He slows down .
NICKY: I ca n't see you but I can smell you . And you make me feel alive in a way I 've never felt before .
STUDENT: You got the wrong window again , man .
NICKY: Oh . Sorry , Andrew . Valerie ? Nicky resumes floating up .
VALERIE: I 'm over here , Nicky ! To the left .
NICKY: That was n't me . I was being possessed y my brother , Adrian . He 's the one who call you a gross pig .
VALERIE: What do you mean , `` possessed ? ''

GATEKEEPER: You 'll get nothing out of me .
ADRIAN: Perhaps a titty twister will loosen you lips .
GATEKEEPER: The only way to save your dad is for you and your brothers to pass through the gates at the same time before he deteriorates completely .
ADRIAN: How much time does Dad have before that happens ? Adrian twists hard .
GATEKEEPER: Thirty minutes . And then whoever claims his throne will have unimaginable power . Adrian throws him down .
LUCIFER: All boobs and no balls .
ADRIAN: Thirty minutes . Hmmm . I hope you do n't mind if I take a seat while I wait fo you .
DAD LIPS: Ahhh ! He pushes Lucifer out of the way .

NICKY: What about you and Grandpa and everyone in Hell ?
DAD: Nicky , I let my butterflies die once upon a time and it 's never stopped hurting . That 's right , you heard me , Holly . I 'm still in love with you .
ANGEL: Oh my G-d . He 's totally talking about me .
DAD: And do n't think I forgot about how crazy you get after a few daiquiris .

NICOLE: You were so worried about Danny . What about me , Mom ? Why were n't you worried about me ?
NICK: Where the fuck is Wolf ? ! ! !
WOLF: One second !
WANDA: OK , listen up . Nobody drinks the milk downstairs . OK ? It appears to e bad .
NICK: I 've had to , well I 've changed the shot ; we 're just a little pressed for time . It 'll just be a CU of Ellen for the last part of the scene , starting with Cora 's `` I was worried about Danny . '' OK ? I 'll find a way to cut this into the fourth take . We almost had it . That was unbelievable , oth of you . But let 's not think about it . That moment is gone , and we 'll , we 'll get another one . I have no doubt about it . OK ? Here we go . Nick walks over and stands beside the camera .
WOLF: I 'm ready , Nick . Nick is so angry he ca n't even look at Wolf .
NICK: Call it , Wanda .
WANDA: And , roll sound .
SOUND: Speed !
WANDA: And , roll camera !

NICK: CUT ! ! ! !
WANDA: What the fuck is that ? ! Sound ?
SOUND: It 's not me .
BOOM: It 's the camera .
WOLF: The fuck it is . It 's off ; it 's not even running . The beep continues , growing louder .
WANDA: What 's going on down there ? ! Do I have a lock-up ? ! Nothing ? You do n't hear a beeping sound ? The street 's quiet .
NICK: Then what the fuck is it ! ! ?
AC: It 's somebody 's watch !
WOLF: Not mine .
WANDA: Not mine .

BOOM: Not mine .
NICK: Where is it ! ! You motherfucker ! You cock-sucking motherfucking bastard ! Where the fuck are you ! ? Where ! ! Where ! !
WOLF: Well , when did he ask you ?
WANDA: Yesterday , when I was helping him check into his hotel .
WOLF: What , the guy ca n't even check into a hotel by himself ?
WANDA: Listen , Wolf , having Chad Palomino in this movie will benefit us all . If being there when he checks into his hotel makes him feel better , then I 'm happy to do it .
WOLF: Well , how did it come up ?
WANDA: He asked me if I liked jazz , I said yes , and he suggested we meet tonight at a jazz club .
WOLF: I like jazz .
WANDA: He did not invite you .
WOLF: Why are you wearing perfume to work ?
WANDA: Because I feel like it .
WOLF: You did n't wear it yesterday .
WANDA: Oh , stop it . You 're acting like a child .
WOLF: My eye !
WANDA: Oh , God . Sweetheart , are you alright ?
WOLF: Do I look alright ? !
WANDA: Let me see . Christ , we 're going to e late .
NICK: Should we call up to the room again ?
JEFF: He said he 'd be right down . Nick lets out a huge yawn .
NICK: I 'm exhausted . I dreamt I was on the set all night . I was just trying to do one shot and everything kept going wrong .
JEFF: That 's an anxiety dream . Are you anxious about something ?
NICK: I do n't know . Sometimes I wonde what the hell I 'm doing in this usiness . It 's all just one compromise and disappointment after another . I do n't know if I have the personality for it .
JEFF: Sounds kind of like an identity crisis .
NICK: Maybe you 're right . Who am I ? What am I really capable of ? Maybe I should just get a job teaching at a women 's college somewhere .
JEFF: How 'd you get into cinematography ?
NICK: I 'm not a cinematographer .
JEFF: You 're not ?
NICK: No . I 'm directing this movie .
JEFF: How 'd you get into directing ?
PALOMINO: They 're waiting downstairs .

WOMAN: Chad ; hold it . This was a one-time deal . You know it , I know it . There is no need for melodrama .

WOMAN: Look , all I ask is that you do n't mention this to anyone .
PALOMINO: Hey , that 's not my style .
WOMAN: Good .
PALOMINO: So , I 'll see you on the set .
NICOLE: God damn it .
PALOMINO: I got two films coming up right afte yours , Nick . One I play a rapist that Michelle Pfeiffer falls in love with . The other I 'm kind of a sexy serial killer who shacks up with Winona Ryder .
NICK: That 's great , man .
PALOMINO: Yeah , but I 'm not into that hostess twinkie shit , Nick .
NICK: Hostess twinkie ?
PALOMINO: That Hollywood shit . It 's all fluff , man . These are the kind of movies I want to do , right here .
NICK: I 'm glad you feel that way , Chad . And I just want to tell you , I 'm eally happy we can work together .

NICK: We 're waiting for Nicole .
PALOMINO: Nicole ? She 's takin ' a tax
NICK: What ?
PALOMINO: Probably taking a shower or something . Hey , how was her shower scene in that Richard Gere movie ?
NICK: Good .
JEFF: Really great .
GAFFER: I think we got nudity today .
AC: It just says `` Scene Six Ellen and Damian kiss . ''
GAFFER: Could be a kiss with nudity .
AC: I like Ellen . She 's my type .

NICK: How 'd you get here ?
NICOLE: Took a taxi .
NICK: Oh . We 've been waiting in front of your apartment for half an hour .
NICOLE: God , I 'm sorry , Nick . Something came up . I forgot to call . I 'm sorry , I feel like such an asshole .
NICK: You 're just saying that because you have Preparation H on your face .
NICOLE: I never should have gone out last night . I hate jazz . God , I look terrible .
NICK: No you do n't .
NICOLE: Do n't bullshit me , Nick .

WOLF: I think so .
PALOMINO: It looks good on you , man .
NICK: Nicole is standing here , Chad , you 're there by the chair . Camera is close on Ellen her first line .
NICOLE: I 've always admired you from afar .
PALOMINO: Admired ? That sounds rathe professional .
NICK: Good ! `` Professional , '' that 's the cue ; Damian steps up to the bed . Camera pulls back . The scene continues .
NICOLE: Well , then loved . How does that sound ?
PALOMINO: It sounds like the champagne talking .
NICOLE: I 've loved you from the moment we met .
PALOMINO: Why did n't you tell me ?
NICOLE: We were working together . I did n't want anything to interfere .
PALOMINO: God . And all this time I thought
NICK: Then the kiss . How 's that feel ?
PALOMINO: Great .
NICK: Nicole ?
NICOLE: Good .
NICK: Wolf , any thoughts ?
WOLF: Nope .
PALOMINO: I 've got a thought . What about Damian having an eyepatch like Wolf 's ?

PALOMINO: Why did n't you tell me ?
NICOLE: We were working together . I did n't want anything to interfere .
PALOMINO: God . And all this time I thought
NICK: Cut . Very good .
WOLF: Not for camera . Chad was completely out of frame .
NICK: Yeah , Chad ; what happened , buddy ? Forget your cue ?
PALOMINO: Oh no , man . I held back . It really felt like something Damian would do ; holding back to the last moment .
NICK: Oh , I see . How 's that for you , Wolf ?
WOLF: I do n't care when he moves . Just give me a fucking cue .
PALOMINO: The Lone Wolf !
NICK: What line did he move on ?
SCRIPT: `` Why did n't you tell me ? ''
NICK: Alright , `` me '' is the new cue . Nicole , how does that feel to you ?
NICOLE: Fine , if that 's what Chad wants to do .
PALOMINO: `` Me , me , me , '' that 's the cue . Let 's shoot ; I 'm stoked !

NICK: And , cut . Very good . Wolf ?
WOLF: Chad missed his cue again ; the whole dolly is unusable .
NICK: Yeah , Chad . What happened ; I thought you were going to hold back till `` me '' ?
PALOMINO: The more I thought about it the more it did n't seem right . And I 'm thinking , watch me here , instead of coming around the bed , what if I just slip here like this and do the whole scene lying down ?
NICK: I do n't know , that seems a little
PALOMINO: Hey , I 'm just throwing out ideas here . Trying to get the juices flowing .
NICK: Nicole , how does that feel to you ?
NICOLE: Well , I can turn to look at him . But wo n't you be shooting the back of my head ?
WOLF: Plus Chad is completely out of the light down there .
PALOMINO: Hey , Wolf ; I 'm not worried about my face , man . It 's about the acting ; that 's all I care about .
WOLF: It 's your call , Nick . His acting o his face .
NICK: For some reason I was hoping we could get both . I thought that 's what we were trying to do here .
WOLF: I 'll have to set another light .
WANDA: We 're ahead of schedule , Nick . I think we can afford a few minutes to set a light for Mr. Palomino .
NICK: Good , let 's do it . Ellen , Damian ; let 's talk for a second .
WANDA: We 'll pause to set this light and go again right away . How long , Wolf ?
NICK: OK , let 's make sure we know what 's going on here . These two people have loved each other for years , each of them not knowing the other was in love with them . And tonight , in this little room it all comes out . It 's like a dam bursting . Does that make sense ? Nicole ?
NICOLE: It makes perfect sense . I just have n't found it yet . I 'll get it though .
NICK: What about you , Chad ?
PALOMINO: I 'm there , man . I got the dam going , the river , everything . You watch , that little change in the blocking is going to open the whole scene up for me .
NICK: Good . Let 's go .
WANDA: Going for picture . Lock it up . And oll sound .
SOUND: Speed !
WANDA: Roll camera !
AC: Rolling !
CLAPPER: Scene six , take three !
NICK: And , action .
NICOLE: I 've always admired you from afar .
PALOMINO: Admired ? That sounds rathe professional .
NICOLE: Well , then loved . How does that sound ?
PALOMINO: It sounds like the champagne talking .
NICOLE: I 've loved you from the moment we met .
PALOMINO: Why did n't you tell me ?
NICOLE: We were working together I 'm sorry , can we cut , Nick ?
NICK: Cut !
WANDA: That 's a cut !
PALOMINO: Dammit ! That was a good one !
NICOLE: I know , I 'm sorry . But this feels eally awkward ; turning all the way around like this .
NICK: Yeah , I think the lying on the bed is not quite working , Chad . Let 's try one with the original blocking .
PALOMINO: Which one was that ? There 's been so many damn changes . Could somebody help me out please ?
SCRIPT: The cue for the original blocking is `` professional . ''
PALOMINO: Thank you . Thank you very much .
NICK: OK , right away . Call it , Wanda .
NICOLE: Nick ? Could I just have a moment ? Is that alright ?
NICK: Of course , Nicole ; are you kidding ? Hold the roll , Wanda .

WANDA: Hold the roll !
NICK: What is it , Chad ?
PALOMINO: Just stop me if I 'm out of line here , ut she says `` admired from afar , '' ight ? Does n't it make sense to see Damian up close and her `` afar ? '' You start on a Close-up of Damian , watch me here ; as she declares her love , the camera moves with me into this primo two-shot that you and the Wolfmeister have set up here .
NICK: What do you think , Wolf ?
WOLF: I do n't like it . This is Ellen 's scene .
NICK: I do n't know ; it sort of makes sense .
PALOMINO: Hey , you did it , man . It 's all there in the writing .
WOLF: I 'd have to relight . Nick pauses , thinking hard .
WANDA: We 're still ahead of schedule , Nick ; if that means anything to you .
NICK: Let 's do it .
WOLF: Get me a tweenie right here , with diffusion .
WANDA: OK , everyone stand by . We 're pausing iefly to set one little light , then we 're going again , right away . Stand-in please for Mr. Palomino .
GAFFER: I 'll do it .
WOLF: Get the fucking light !
SCRIPT: Thanks .
PALOMINO: My pleasure . Sugar ?
SCRIPT: Just a bit .
PALOMINO: You like jazz ?
SCRIPT: Very much .
PALOMINO: Maybe we could go hear some tonight .
WANDA: It 's going well I think . Do n't you think ?
SCRIPT: Very well . What time do you think we 'll finish ?
WANDA: Early I hope . I 'm going to a jazz club tonight .
SCRIPT: Really ? So am I . He 's wonderful , is n't he ?
WANDA: Chad ?
SCRIPT: He 's so natural , like air . Nicole approaches .
NICOLE: I do n't know his sign , but I think his moon is in Uranus .
SCRIPT: You do n't have to be nasty .
PALOMINO: Yo , Wolfman . Is this my new mark ?
WOLF: Until you change it . Where 's my fucking eyepatch ? !
GAFFER: Hey , Chad .
PALOMINO: Hey , whatya say .

PALOMINO: Maurice ! Hey , Maurice Chevalier ! Any elation ? Probably not . Hey , smoking crew guys , really .
GAFFER: Hey thanks , Chad . Actually I wrote a script .
PALOMINO: Oh , yeah ?
GAFFER: Uh , yeah .
PALOMINO: Lower it about three feet .
NICK: Would you care to have a drink tonight ? Hey , Nicole , what do you say you and I have a drink tonight ?
NICOLE: Oh , Nick ! I 'm sorry !
NICK: That 's OK , no problem . I 'm just slapping a little water on my face .
NICOLE: Is it ? Something feels off .
NICK: Yeah , you seem a little tense .
NICOLE: Do I ?
NICK: But do n't worry about it . Just take your attention off yourself and put it on Chad . Work off him a little more .
NICOLE: OK , I 'll try that .
NICK: And listen , I know he 's no Olivier . But he 's got something , do n't you think ? Kind of a natural presence .
NICOLE: Oh yes , he 's very natural .
NICK: So Nicole anything else I can help you with ?
NICOLE: Actually there is . Could you maybe ask him to brush his teeth ?
NICK: Oh , sure .
WOLF: My eye is killing me .
WANDA: Put your eyepatch on .
WOLF: I lost it .
WANDA: Is that little light set yet ?
WOLF: That little light was set ten minutes ago .
WANDA: Get me the A Team in here right away . Nick , Nicole , and Mr. Palomino . Why did n't you tell me ?
WOLF: Hey , you 're not worried about the time , I 'm not worried about the time .
WANDA: Oh , I am very worried about the time !
WOLF: I know you are .
WANDA: What is that supposed to mean ?
WOLF: What do you think it means ? !
WANDA: I do n't know what it means !
WOLF: Oh yes you do , you know exactly what it means .
WANDA: I have no idea what you 're talking about ! Why are you
WOLF: You do n't understand me , Wanda ! You have no idea
WANDA: I do n't understand you ? ! ! All I do is take care of you ! ! !
NICK: Hey , hey , hey ! What the hell 's going on here ? ! Jesus , Wanda . This is a very intimate scene and a lot of tension on the set does n't help . OK ? Now , Wolf , let 's just go through the first part of the move . Damian , on your new mark . Good . Close-up , Damian ; Ellen in the background .
WOLF: Hey , that 's my fucking eyepatch .
PALOMINO: Wolf , could I borrow it ? Cause I 'm telling you , Nick ; it really feels ight . I feel like this guy now , man .
NICK: I do n't know , Chad . I do n't think it works .
PALOMINO: You 're wrong , man . I 'm going to fight you on this one .
WOLF: Hey , it 's my fucking eyepatch and I do n't want anyone wearing it . It 's insanitary .
PALOMINO: Fine . I 'll get my own . Nick , send someone out for an eyepatch . I 'll fucking pay for it myself .
NICK: Listen , Chad . I did n't want to say this in front of Wolf but it makes you look a little gay .
PALOMINO: Really ?
NICK: Yeah , a little bit .
PALOMINO: Jesus .
WANDA: Are you ready , Nick ?
NICK: One second . You need a rehearsal , Wolf ?
WOLF: Let 's just fucking shoot it ! !
PALOMINO: El Lobo !
NICK: Call it , Wanda .
WANDA: Going for picture . Lock it up . And oll sound .

NICK: And , action .
NICOLE: I 've always admired you from afar .
PALOMINO: Admired ? That sounds rathe professional .
NICOLE: Well , then loved . How does that sound ?
PALOMINO: It sounds like the champagne talking .
NICOLE: I 've loved you from the moment we met .
PALOMINO: Why did n't you tell me ?
NICOLE: We were working together . I did n't want anything to interfere God !
NICK: Cut !
WANDA: That 's a cut . Hold the work , going again , right away .
NICOLE: I 'm sorry , Nick . I do n't know why I did that . I 'm sorry .
PALOMINO: Nick , could I talk to you a second ?
WANDA: A momentary delay . Everyone stand y . We 're going again , right away .
SOUND: Excuse me , Ellen ? You were a tad low on that take .
NICOLE: Oh , OK . I 'll bring it up . Actually could I listen to the take before ?
PALOMINO: I 'm out of here , man !
NICK: What 's the matter ? !
PALOMINO: I like you , but I made a big mistake taking this part . Have someone call me a cab .
NICK: Wait a second , Chad . Just talk to me . What 's going on ! ?
PALOMINO: I ca n't act with this woman . I know she 's a friend of yours but I got to tell you she can not act worth a shit ! I 'm giving her everything ! The whole thing I just did with the hair ; did you see that ? I came up with that on my own because I thought it would help her . But no , she 's giving me nothing ! I 'm out of here .
NICK: Something came up .
PALOMINO: No . She was in my hotel room and she did n't want you to know it . OK ? I 'm sorry it had to come out like this ut I told her this morning `` thanks a lot , it was a lot of fun last night ut let 's get something straight it was just a one-time deal , '' and she did n't want to hear that . She wanted more , you see what I 'm saying ? It 's rejection .
NICK: Nicole , listen
NICOLE: Nick , it 's my fault the scene is n't working . I apologize . Chad , I apologize to you too . I 'm completely unfocused here and I think you 're absolutely right ; what we need to do is loosen the scene up somehow .
NICK: What would you like to do ?
NICOLE: I was wondering if we could try improvising the scene . More along the lines of what Chad has been doing . Maybe that would help me find something .
NICK: That 's a fantastic idea . What do you think , Chad ?
PALOMINO: Hey , that 's the only way I can work . Let 's take it apart , let 's cut loose .
NICK: Good ! And we 'll shoot it ! Hell , why not ? !
PALOMINO: Roll that motherfucking camera , Wolfie !
WOLF: Kiss my ass !
PALOMINO: Yeah ! Let 's go !

NICOLE: You 're right . How does despised sound ?
PALOMINO: Great ! What 's it mean ?
NICOLE: It 's sort of like I think you 're a piece of shit .
PALOMINO: That sounds like the champagne talking .
NICOLE: It 's not . I really do think you are a piece of shit .
PALOMINO: No , you do n't . You love me .
NICOLE: The fuck I do . I ca n't stand looking at you !
PALOMINO: Then I guess I have nothing else to say .
NICOLE: No , I think you have a lot more to say , Damian .
PALOMINO: Well , I am surprised you feel this way , Ellen . I always thought you admired
NICOLE: That 's not what I meant . You should tell everyone what you just told Nick behind the set .
PALOMINO: Hey , this is n't part of the scene .
NICOLE: Say it anyway The reason this scene is n't working is because you and I slept together last night . Did everyone hear that ? ! I fucked Chad last night !
PALOMINO: See , Nick ! I told you this was about ejection !
NICOLE: You fucking scumbag ! You think I give a rat 's ass about you ? ! I was there to get laid and even that was a joke !
PALOMINO: You know , you are really starting to piss me off !
NICOLE: Oh , does that mean you 're not going to come wiggle on the bed anymore , or stroke my hair real soft and concerned , or kiss me like a soap opera acting piece of shit !
NICK: OK , guys , I think we can stop there .
PALOMINO: You bet your ass we can stop ! Wanda , call me a cab !
NICK: Hold on , Chad . Let 's just try to calm down .
PALOMINO: Fuck you . I 'm out of here , man . This movie is bullshit .
NICK: Now wait a second , Chad . There 's no eason for hostility .
PALOMINO: Shut up , you fucking loser . The only eason I took this part was because someone said you knew Quentin Tarantino ! You 're nowhere , man .
NICK: Hey , you want to go ? Go ! I 'm sick of your shit , you hostess twinkie motherfucker !
PALOMINO: What 'd you call me ?
NICK: You heard me .
PALOMINO: Say it again .
NICK: You hostess twinkie motherfucker !
WANDA: Alright , everyone just stop . Stop ! Stop this right now !
WOLF: Alright , you 've asked for it , Chad !
WANDA: Wolf !
NICOLE: Oh , God !
NICK: You want to pick my brain ? ! This is the way I direct hostess twinkie scumbags like you !
SCRIPT: Chad
NICK: Are you alright ?
NICOLE: Do n't touch me .
GAFFER: It 's called `` Tsunami . '' A Japanese tidal wave hits New York . You 've an ex-Navy S.E.A L. frogman , working undercover . You save the city . You 'd e perfect for the lead . That 's my number ; call me , or I 'll call you . Either way it 's been great working with you , man .
NICK: Nicole , I 'm sorry . I did n't mean it . You were great in that Richard Gere movie .
NICOLE: Shut up . You 're no different than he is . You lie , you 're deceitful
NICK: I 'm not lying . Christ , I tell everyone how great you are . I 've got nothing ut respect and admiration for you .
NICOLE: Oh God , now you 're doing your own fucking script .
NICK: Well , why do you think I wrote it ? !
NICOLE: I have no idea !
NICK: It 's about you . It 's about how I feel about you .
NICOLE: Christ , did you get a bump on you head , Nicky . 'Cause you 're talking like an idiot .
NICK: Nicole . I 've loved you since the day we met .
NICOLE: Why did n't you tell me ?
NICK: I did n't want anything to get in the way of us working together .
NICOLE: God , and all this time I thought
WANDA: Do n't go out that door !
AC: Why not ?
WANDA: It 's part of the set , goddamnit . Now go around .
AC: Next time . This is an emergency .
WANDA: Has Ellen showed up yet ?
WALKIE: ssss kkkkkrrk .
WANDA: Get her into wardrobe right away .
WALKIE: ssskk ssssrrrk ?
WANDA: No ! Scene six ; Scene five has been postponed . I 'm not going to say it again ; Mr. Palomino is not working today . Now where is that smoke machine !

TITO: Well , fucking knock ! !

NICOLE: I never said that !
NICK: You did too . You said , `` Everything feels fake . ''

CORA: Oh Jesus , you sound just like you father
NICK: Mom , I 'm serious .
CORA: OK , OK . I wo n't move .
NICK: Thank you .
TITO: Why ?
NICK: I told you why .
TITO: Tell me again .
NICK: Look , Tito . It 's not that big a deal . It 's a dream , alright . Strange things happen in a dream . All you have to do is laugh . Why is that such a problem ?
TITO: Why does it have to be a dwarf ?
NICK: What ?
TITO: Why does my character have to be a dwarf ?
NICK: He does n't have to be a dwarf .
TITO: Then why is he ? ! Is that the only way you can make this a dream ; put a dwarf in it ?
NICK: No , Tito ; that 's not
TITO: Have you ever had a dream with a dwarf in it ? ! Do you know anyone who 's had a dream with a dwarf in it ? NO ! I do n't even have dreams with dwarves in them ! The only place I 've seen dwarves in dreams is in stupid movies like this ! Make it weird ; put a dwarf in it . Everyone will go `` whoa whoa whoa , must be a dream , there 's a fucking dwarf in it ! '' Well , I 'm sick of it . You can take this Dream Sequence and shove it up your ass !
WANDA: Nick ? I can get right on the phone . We 'll try to get another small person here as soon as possible .
NICK: No . He 's absolutely right .
WOLF: You want to just shoot Ellen , Nick ? She could be in the dream by herself .
NICK: No . We 're not going to shoot anything . I 'm sorry . Thanks for all your help , ut it 's over . I ca n't take it anymore . I tried to roll with it but it 's time to face the music ; I ca n't do this . I am not a director . The shoot is over . I give up .

NICK: Mom , you kook ! That was incredible ! Did you know we were filming ?

NICK: Oh , hold on . Let me think a second .

CHAD: Oh God , Wanda ! I love your power . It 's like an afferdesiac to me !
NICK: In closing I 'd like to say to all the people who told me not to make this movie , who would n't meet with me or return a simple phone call . To my favorite professor at Film School whose parting advice to me was to take a job teaching at a women 's college . To Delores DelSporto , the girl I loved in high school who left me for a Jr .

HISPANIC WOMAN: I knew it was you .
LOGAN: Do n't we all .
IN SPANISH: What the hell happened to you ? ! What are you hiding from ? !
PIERCE: As I live and breathe . The Wolverine . And he 's a junkie now .
LOGAN: Who the fuck are you ?
PIERCE: Y'know , you got some buckshot in your door . I heard you were in Phoenix . Food 's better there by the way . But then , last night , some friends in Texas H-P called , told me they found three dead cholos in a pullout out on 54 . Not unusual , except one was missing a hand . Another a leg . Multiple parallel lacerations . Slashes , femoral , thoracic . So , they 're thinking it was either an escaped Tiger o Freddy Krueger but neither of those can drive , one being fictional the other extinct . And since the wheel lugs they found elong to a ` 24 Gauntlet
LOGAN: Get out . Now .
PIERCE: Has she found you yet ? Gabriela ? See , I 'm not looking for you , mutey . Not really . I 'm looking fo someone who 's looking for you .
THEN: She took something of mine . Something for which I am esponsible . When I was n't looking . Mexican lady . Long hair , long legs , Long gone . Has her sights on you . No bells ?
LOGAN: I do n't know any Gabriela . So get the fuck out .
PIERCE: I know what you 're hiding , amigo . Cue ball south of the border ? Logan tenses , says nothing .
LOGAN: What do you want ?
PIERCE: A little cooperation . Flicks a business card .
LOGAN: Mr. Espiranza , yes , I know I said June , but I want the boat now . Yes . Why does that mean the price go up ?
CALIBAN: He 's having a bad day .
LOGAN: They 're all bad days .
CALIBAN: He needed these six hours ago . This is not enough , you know . It wo n't last through the week .
LOGAN: I 'm working on it .
CALIBAN: Your turn . Logan sighs and crosses toward a cabinet .
LOGAN: He 's not talking with anybody .
CALIBAN: Do n't be so sure . He had all these details . I thought that tank was supposed to provide some sort of arrier . It 's got all these cracks in it . What good is that ?
LOGAN: Please stop .
CALIBAN: He 's been asking questions again . He 's trying to read my mind .
CHARLES: Friends , I have Good News today ! It 's not about what you do . It 's not about your deeds . You ca n't live up to his rules . God knows you ca n't . That 's OK ! We 're imperfect !
LOGAN: No .
CHARLES: The new Quesalupa from Taco Bell . Get it with chicken , get it with steak . But with cheese baked right in the shell it 's the next big
BEAT: Who are you ?
LOGAN: You know who I am .
CHARLES: The man who puts me to sleep .
LOGAN: We could both use some sleep .
CHARLES: What are you fucking doing to me ! ?
LOGAN: You remember what they are . The shots mellow the seizures , the pills keep them from happening . Charles stares at the pills .
CHARLES: Fuck off , Logan .
LOGAN: So you know who I am now .
CHARLES: I always know who you are . Sometimes I just do n't recognize you .
LOGAN: Take the pills .
MUTTERS: you leave me alone with that fucking Albino he wo n't listen to me . I know a damn speciation when I see one .
LOGAN: A what ?
CHARLES: A speciation .
THEN: A new mutant . A young one . There are forces trying to kill them ! They need help !
LOGAN: Too bad you 're not in that business anymore .
CHARLES: They want your help , not mine . Oh , yes . That 's how fucking stupid they are . They 're waiting for you . At the Statue of Liberty .
LOGAN: The Statue of Liberty was a long time ago , Charles . A long time .
CHARLES: Impossible . Logan pulls the quilt over the old man .
LOGAN: You always thought we were part of God 's Plan . Maybe we were just God 's mistake .
CHARLES: What a disappointment you are . Logan takes this in . Stung .
LOGAN: I 'm not in the mood for bedtime
CHARLES: A warm capper to life as an assassin , hooked on barbiturates . You were an animal , but we took you in . I gave you a family .
DARKENS: They 're gone now .
CHARLES: What did you do ? Logan eyes him a hard beat , then turns to go .
LOGAN: It 's for your own good .
CHARLES: No . NO it 's NOT ! You 're waiting fo me to die !
CALIBAN: I do n't want to fight but we need to talk about these things . There are things .
LOGAN: What things .
CALIBAN: Well . Would it be considered nagging if repeated my observation that the dose is too low . To suppress the seizures .
LOGAN: It 's what the guy gave me . I was n't in a position to make demands .
CALIBAN: I almost died this morning . That seizure was a
LOGAN: It was n't even a minute .
CALIBAN: It felt a lot longer than a minute . I could n't breathe . I was in a terrible state . You 're less affected , Logan Please do n't give me that look . You know he needs a higher dose . And I know you 've got more money squirreled away .
LOGAN: That money 's to get us out of here .
CALIBAN: No . Not us . You and him . You 're saving up for a bloody Sunseeker . I do n't see myself hiding below deck like Nosferatu , doing laundry , do you ? Folding your underwear . Making pigs in a blanket .
LOGAN: I do n't need this right now .
CALIBAN: A year ago , you asked me to help you . And God knows I try but I ca n't help you , not really , if you do n't talk to me . I hear you at night . You are n't sleeping . You do n't want to talk about that . O the booze you 're drinking or the pus you keep wiping from you knuckles or the blood I wash from your clothes or those brand new holes in your chest , that have n't healed . And I very much doubt you want to talk about the fact that you ca n't read the label on the side of that bottle . It 's Ibuprofen .
WOMAN'S VOICE: Senor Logan .
LOGAN: Oh , Jesus .
WOMAN: Please . We need a ride .
LOGAN: Not available . Call a cab .

TURNS: How 'd you find me ? Huh ? ! ` Cause you are fucking up my life , lady . The people after you are on my ass now .

THEN: Was . In Mexico City .
LOGAN: When did that happen ?
GABRIELA: This morning . Near the border . I got away from them . But they know my car now .
LOGAN: Where did you get this ?
GABRIELA: It does n't matter .
LOGAN: Does to me .
GABRIELA: My boyfriend . He wants to kill me . And take her . He eyes the girl standing in the door .
LOGAN: That 's your daughter ? Gabriela and the girl exchange looks .

LOGAN: Yeah . I 'll be safe .
CALIBAN: Hello ! Logan ! What happened ?
LOGAN: The job was wrong to begin with .
CALIBAN: I 'll close your trunk . I 'm making orscht for Charles if you want some . He got dressed for lunch
LOGAN: Are n't you supposed to see shit coming ?
CALIBAN: I 'm a glorified truffle pig , not a clairvoyant .
LOGAN: Go inside . Keep Charles quiet .
DEAD SERIOUS: Go . Inside . Caliban shuffles away as
PIERCE: Yes , it is . In fact , I believe it elongs to a multinational smelting company based in Shanghai .
SMILES: Where you keeping the old man ? In there ? Or there . I 'd like to meet him . I 'm told HSA classifies his ain as a weapon of mass destruction now . ` Damned shame , what happened back east .
LOGAN: He 's been dead for a year .
PIERCE: I need the girl .
LOGAN: What girl .
PIERCE: One that goes with that ball you 're holding . That 's special rubber , you know . Coated with something called J-Tek . Gets in through the skin .
FAUX SERIOUS: Very calming . Like Magnesium but without the side effects .
SMILES: You feel calmer ?
LOGAN: There 's no girl here . Another laugh , then
PIERCE: I know you went to the motel .
LOGAN: I was called there . There was no girl . Just the woman .
PIERCE: `` The woman '' .
SIGHS: Such as she was .
LOOKS UP: So you saw Gabriela but you did n't call me ? That hurts . Say , you did n't shoot the poor thing , did you ?
LOGAN: No . Did you ?
PIERCE: I asked you first .

PIERCE: Of course . I wish you had called me , Logan . Like I asked .
SMILES: See . You 're not the only one who 's
LOGAN: Hey !
CHARLES: Logan .

CALIBAN: Looks like Ex-military . Maybe a ounty hunter ? He hands Caliban Don Pierce 's business card .
LOGAN: Worse . Caliban reads Alkali on the card .
CALIBAN: He 's by himself ?
LOGAN: Not for long .
THINKING: Get him back in his ride . Drive him to the wash and dump him . Then take the car into Juarez , leave it fo the vultures .
CALIBAN: What if he wakes up before I get there ? He hands Caliban the gun .
LOGAN: Text me where you are and we 'll pick you up .
CHARLES: You did what you could , Laura . Well . Yes . Of course , it 's painful .
LOGAN: You 'll get it back after I figure out what you and your mother have got us into .
CHARLES: Logan .
LOGAN: What .
CHARLES: That was n't her mother you met .

PIERCE: How about you tell me where the girl is first . Or maybe I ought to ask the cue ball . Seems friendly .
LOGAN: I told you , she 's not here . Where 's Caliban ? ! Pierce smirks , amused by Logan 's anger .
PIERCE: I left him in the same hole you were going to leave me .
TO PIERCE: You got extra barbecue tongs fo this guy ? THE FEDERALE COMMANDER nods .
PIERCE: Jesus . Seeing you this way , Wolverine , it breaks my heart .
LOGAN: As soon as I rip it out of you chest , fuck-stick .
IN SPANISH: No one goes in without Federale escort . I am in charge .
PIERCE: That-a-girl .
SIGHS: Laura .
FEDERALE COMMANDER: Tomar el mutante !
PIERCE: Commander , stop !
FEDERALE COMMANDER: You said alive or dead .
PIERCE: Laura ! NO ! NO ! !
CHARLES: My Lord .
LOGAN: Hold on !
CHARLES: You know who she is , Logan .
LOGAN: No . I do n't .
CHARLES: Does she remind you of anybody ?
PIERCE: Leave nothing behind fellas . We were not here !
CALIBAN: I 'm sorry . I believe you 're thinking of someone else .
PIERCE: ' I 'm not mistaken , you used to work for my team , for the good guys . You were helping round up all the old mutes .
CALIBAN: I will not . I will not help you .
PIERCE: Of course that 's what you 'd say . But then I got this theory that people do n't really change .
PIERCE: Beware the light .
GABRIELA: I am a nurse and for ten years I have worked at Transigen research in Mexico City .
LIKE THIS: Comprende ?

CHARLES: Stop it . For God 's sake I can do that myself !
LOGAN: Well , you 're not doing it !
CLERK: Yo . Girlie . You got ta pay for that .
LOGAN: Not okay .
GABRIELA: As the children became older , they ecame difficult to control .
WHISPERS: Inside this building is something new . Something better than X-23 .
HUSHED: We are going to save as many as we can . I have read about a place in the north . A place for mutants . They call it Eden .
CHARLES: Is this where we 're hiding out ?
LOGAN: We 're not hiding out . We 're gon na get a couple hours sleep , clean up , get new clothes , ditch the limo , get a new ride and get the fuck out .
CHARLES: This film is a classic , Laura . Almost a hundred years old now . I first saw it at the Esoldo in Dewsbury when I was your age .
LOGAN: For fuck 's sake .
CLERK: Who are you guys ? More cops ? Dude , I already told them everything .
LOGAN: You read this in your spare time ?
CHARLES: Logan . Logan turns to Charles who forces a smile .

LOGAN: How long has it been since you took your meds ?
NO RESPONSE: Charles . How long ?
CHARLES: I do n't know . Two days .
LOGAN: You saw what happened last night . If that shit had gone on longer , everyone at that casino He stops himself .
CHARLES: I did what I had to do to stop those men from taking Laura .
LOGAN: You did n't do anything . You freaked out and had a fucking seizure .
CHARLES: I guess you prefer me pharmaceutically castrated , ambling on like some lunatic . So much easier on you .
LOGAN: Easier ? There 's nothing easy about you .
CHARLES: Yes , Yes please , be like the rest of the world and blame someone else for your boring shit .
LOGAN: Yeah , I know , Pop , I 'm such a giant

LOGAN: What are we doing ? !

LOGAN: Yes . It means nothing to me . Especially since Nurse Gabriela made all this Eden shit up from fucking comic books .
CHARLES: What are you talking about ?
LOGAN: Give those to him . Take out two and give them to him .
CHARLES: What do you mean
LOGAN: Now . For fuck 's sake . Take the pills . Now .

CHARLES: Happy ?
PULLING OVER: Cop . Fuck .
CHARLES: What does he want ?
LOGAN: She . I might have been speeding .
CHARLES: Are you sure that 's all it is ?
LOGAN: If it was n't , there 'd be a lot more than her behind us . I need you to please try and not kill this lady . Okay ? Laura retracts her claws .
TROOPER: License and registration , please . Logan reaches into the glove box .
LOGAN: I just bought it , but I here
TAKES IT: Any idea just how `` mite '' fast you were going , Mr Howlett ?
LOGAN: Seventy ? Ish ?
TROOPER: Try ninety six . Ish .
LOGAN: Shit . I did n't think this thing could make that .
TROOPER: You 're not from round here . It 's harvest season . You need to be more careful . This your daughter ?

TROOPER: But she does have a name .
LOGAN: Laura . The Trooper looks at Laura .
TROOPER: That your name , honey ?
LAURA NODS: And is this man your father ? Laura looks at Logan . A pause . Then nods .
LEANS FORWARD: My son has a bit of a lead foot . I try to tell him that Mount Rushmore will still be there and just as eautiful a day from now . The Trooper finishes writing the ticket
TROOPER: You got a nice family . Try to keep ` em safe , James .
LOGAN: HEY
CHARLES: Language , Logan . And you 're screaming at a machine .
LOGAN: What , she can gut a man with he feet , but she ca n't hear naughty words ?
CHARLES: She can learn to be better .
LOGAN: You mean , better than me .
CHARLES: Actually , yes . And by the way , Laura 's foot claws are an obvious esult of her gender . In a pride of lions , females are caregivers of the young and hunters of the pride , they have front claws to hunt and foot claws for defense . They use the foot claw to strike the belly or bladder of the attacker , thus ensuring thei escape and survival .
LOGAN: Shit . Oh well .
CHARLES: We have to help them .
LOGAN: We have to keep moving . Someone will come along .

SUDDENLY BRIGHTENS: Oh , the price of progress .

LOGAN: That should hold it .
WILL: Until the next time .
JACKSON: Evening , Mr. Munson . Will just nods .
WILL: Why do n't you ask your boys ?
JACKSON: You understand , you 're trespassing ight now , right ?
WILL: I have an easement with the previous owner of your property .
JACKSON: Previous being the operative word . Who 's this ?
LOGAN: I 'm nobody . Just a guy telling you to get back in your nice truck and play Okie dickhead somewhere else .
JACKSON: You hire some muscle , Mr. Munson ?
WILL: He 's a friend of mine .
JACKSON: A friend with a big mouth .
LOGAN: I hear that a lot .

LOW: Put her down . Bad Logan stares at her . Drops Laura .
KATHRYN: Stay down there , Will !
REAVER DRIVER: I 'll pick em up meet em halfway . Let the clean up crew in .
DR. RICE: No .
RICE: We learned the hard way with the X-23 's . We assumed , because they were children , their emotional esponses could be manipulated . But you ca n't nurture rage . You must simply design it .
SMILES: Like God did .
PIERCE: Who the fuck is that ?
LOGAN: You need to keep this around you . Charles . Listen , you need

LOGAN: I 'm alright . I 'm fine .
OLD DOCTOR: No . You 're not . I mean , I know you 're different . But that does n't change the fact that something inside you is poisoning you . You need to check yourself into a hospital and run some tests , find out what it is .
LOGAN: I know what it is .
OLD DOCTOR: Please . Mister . If you do n't want to go to a hospital , maybe I can
LOGAN: Doc . Look at me . You seem like a nice man . But you wan na save a life ? Save yours . And everyone else 's in this place . Let us get on our way . Logan turns to Laura . She meets his eyes .

CELIE: I 'm more worried about the social thing . Are therelikegangs , or ?

CELIE: So Blacks are

FENTON: Buddy Deeds . He had a way .
HOLLIS: He known who it was onnacouna the tire tracks in the dirt from the ack of the garage to where they loaded up . `` Old Fishbait , '' he says , `` never lifted a thing in this world if there was a way he could roll it . '' More laughter
FENTON: Wo n't be another like him . That boy of his does n't come near it . You ask me , he 's all hat and no cattle
HOLLIS: Sam ! I was just telling a few about your old man .

HOLLIS: Oh , you know , the usual troublemakers . Danny Padilla from the Sentinel , that crowd .
FENTON: Every other damn thing in the country is called after Martin Luther King , they ca n't let our side have one measly park ?
HOLLIS: King was n't Mexican , Fenton
FENTON: Bad enough all the street names are in Spanish
SAM: They were here first .
FENTON: Then name it after Big Chief Shitinabucket ! Whoever that Tonkawa fella was . He had the Mexes beat by centuries .
HOLLIS: There was a faction pulling for that oy who was killed in the Gulf War Ruben
SAM: Santiago .
HOLLIS: Right . But nobody here ever noticed him till they read his name on the national news
FENTON: They just wanted it to be one of theirs
HOLLIS: That 's not the whole story . The Mexicans that know , that remember , understand what Buddy was for thei people . Hell , it was Mercedes ove there who swung the deciding vote for him .
SAM: That so ?
HOLLIS: She put it even at three to three , so as the Mayor I get to cast the tiebreaker . The older generation wo n't have any problem with it . They emember how Buddy come to be Sheriff , that it was all 'cause he took thei part .

BUDDY: So ?
WADE: I roust some muchacho on the street , does n't have his papers , all he got to say is `` Yo trabajo para Jimmy Herrera . ''
BUDDY: I 'm not doing it .
WADE: Come again ?
BUDDY: It 's your deal . You sweated it out of him , you pick it up .
WADE: There 's gon na be some left over fo you , Buddy . I take care of my boys .
BUDDY: That 's not the point .
WADE: You feeling bad for Jimmy ? Have him tell you the size of the mordida they took out of his hide when he un a place on the other side . Those old boys in Ciudad Leon
BUDDY: I 'm not picking it up .
WADE: You do whatever I say you do or else you put it on the trail , son .
BUDDY: How 'bout thishow 'bout you put that shield on this table and vanish efore you end up dead or in jail ?
WADE: Who said anything about shootin ' anybody ?
BUDDY: Whole different story ; is n't it ?
WADE: You 're fired . You 're outta the department .

HOLLIS: We made our collection at Roderick 's place and that was the last anybody seen hide nor hair of him . He went missing the next day , along with ten thousand dollars in county funds from the safe at the jail .
SAM: Never heard from him again ?
HOLLIS: Not a peep . Buddy run the man out of town .
FENTON: Buddy Deeds said a thing , he damn well backed it up . Wo n't be anothe like him .
SAM: So he arrested all of Jimmy Herrera 's people and sent 'em back to the othe side ? Hollis sees what Sam is getting at , grins
HOLLIS: Ohhe come to an accommodation . Money does n't always need to change hands to keep the wheels turning .
SAM: Right .
HOLLIS: Look , I know you had some problems with your father , and he and Muriel well
FENTON: Your mother was a saint .
HOLLIS: but Buddy Deeds was my salvation . Sam nods , speaks softly
SAM: Wo n't be another like him .
DEL: it 's an honor for me to assume command of this unit , and I look forward to working with all of you .
DEL: that we 've been sent here to mark time until we are absorbed by anothe unit .
DEL: You may have heard rumors that I run a very tight operation . These rumors are not exaggerated .
SAM: Tell him I 'll catch him later .
SAM: Tell him to try me tomorrow .
SAM: He 's right .
OTIS: You were n't in here tonight , were you ?
CHET: No sir .
OTIS: Go out through the back .
ANGLO MOTHER: You 're just tearin ' everything down ! Tearin ' down our heritage , tearin ' down the memory of people that fought and died for this land .
CHICANO FATHER: We fought the U.S. Army , the Texas Rangers
ANGLO FATHER: Winners get the bragging rights , that 's how it goes .
PRINCIPAL: I think it would be best not to put things in terms of winners and losers
ANGLO MOTHER: Well , the way she 's teachin ' it has got everything switched around . I was on the textbook committee , and her version is not
PRINCIPAL: We think of the textbook as kind of a guide , not an absolute
ANGLO MOTHER: it is not what we set as the standard ! Now you people can believe what you want , but when it comes to teaching our children
CHICANO MOTHER: They 're our children , too !
ANGLO FATHER: The men who founded this state have a right to have their story
DANNY: The men who founded this state broke from Mexico because they needed slavery to be legal to make a fortune in the cotton business !
PILAR: I think that 's a bit of an oversimplification
ANGLO FATHER: Are you reporting this meeting o unnin ' it , Danny ?
DANNY: Just adding a little historical perspective
ANGLO FATHER: You may call it history , but I call it propaganda . I 'm sure they got their own account of the Alamo on the other side , but we 're not on the other side , so we 're not about to have it taught in our schools !
PILAR: There 's no reason to be so threatened y this
ANGLO MOTHER: but when you start changing who did what to who .
TEACHER: We 're not changing anything , we 're presenting a more complete picture .
ANGLO MOTHER: And that 's what 's got to stop !
TEACHER: There 's enough ignorance in the world without us encouraging it in the classroom
ANGLO MOTHER: Now who are you calling ignorant ?
PRINCIPAL: Folks , I know this is a very emotional issue for some of you , but we do have other business to attend to
CHICANO FATHER: We 're not going to get some resolution on this ?

SAM: No problem .
SAM: Any time .
MIKEY: There 's not that much down here , Colonel . Big O 's is the only place in the county that our African American soldiers are uhmthat they feel comfortable in .
DEL: Have we had trouble there before ?
CLIFF: Since I 've been stationed here ? A fistfight now and then
MIKEY: We had a kid pass out in the men 's oom . The town is n't much .

DEL: Why do n't we make it once a week fo a while ?
CLIFF: No problem , sir . Del notices bow hard they are breathing

SAM: Yeah , we 'll have folks swimming ove to Mexico to work in the sweatshops . Sam looks at the folder of reports .
BEN: Yeah , this is Skinny .
SAM: Skinny ?
BEN: We find a body , it 's either Skinny or Stinky , depending on how much meat there is on the bones .
SAM: Nice job .
BEN: Male , 40 to 50 years old , five-foot- eleven , chewed tobaccothen we get into the dental records
SAM: Charley Wade .
BEN: That badge
SAM: it did n't come out of a cereal ox .
BEN: Yeah .
SAM: You know the popular version of how he left town .
BEN: Everybody on the border knows that story .
SAM: You got a cause of death ?
BEN: Skull was intact , no soft tissue leftnot much to go on .
SAM: So he could have gone out to the ase , hopped the fence , dug down into the dirt on the old rifle range and had a heart attack . Ben smiles , closes the folder
BEN: You uhmyou remember what old Buddy carried for a side arm ?
SAM: Colt Peacemaker .
BEN: A .45
SAM: He swore by it . What ?
BEN: Just wondering .
SAM: So is Buddy on your short list ?
BEN: If it was some poor mojado , swam across at night , got lost in the scrub and starved out there , we would n't go any further . But this is a formerly prominent citizen .
SAM: You got to investigate . No question about it .
BEN: What I will do is keep names out of it till we got some answers or hit a dead end . You know how the press is with a murder storyeven if it 's forty years old .
SAM: Yeah , it 's a pretty cold trail .
BEN: I remember Charley Wade come to my father 's hardware store once when I was a little boy . I 'd heard stories how he shot this one , how he shot that oneman winked at me and I peed in my pants . Winked at me .
PILAR: Okay , we have the fight against the Spanish with bloody conflict fo dozens of years till they 're finally defeated in 1821 and Mexican independence is declared . Anglo settlers are invited

HOLLIS: Sounds great . Where do I sign up ?
SAM: I have n't been out here for a while .
HOLLIS: You go by your old house ?
SAM: No .
HOLLIS: Just as well . The new people just painted it some God-awful color
SAM: We found a body out by the Army base yesterday . Been there for a long time . Hollis squints at a rubber lure , rejects it
HOLLIS: Was it Davy Crockett or Jim Bowie ?
SAM: You recall if Charley Wade was a Mason ?
HOLLIS: Charley ? I believe he was . Used to go for lodge meetings over to Laredo . What 's he got to do with your body ?
SAM: All it was wearing was a big old Masonic ring and a Rio County Sheriffs adge .
HOLLIS: I told the story enough timeshell , we were just in the car , he was stewing about the fight with Buddy while we drove over to Roderick Bledsoe 's
SAM: Bledso
HOLLIS: He owned the colored roadhouse before Big O
SAM: He still living ?
HOLLIS: No . I think his widow 's still in their place in Darktown , though . You think it 's Charley Wade , huh ?
SAM: Forensics people are sure of it . You have any idea who might have put him there ? Hollis makes a great show of considering
HOLLIS: There 's no call for that , Sam . Fella made himself a pile of enemies ove the years .
SAM: And Buddy was one of them .
HOLLIS: We got that dedication tomorrow . This is a hell of a time to be draggin ' up old business .
SAM: People have worked this whole big thing up around my father . If it 's uilt on a crime , they deserve to know . Now I understand why you might want to believe he could n't do it .
HOLLIS: And I understand why you might want to think he could .
SAM: Thanks for your time , Hollis .
HOLLIS: Look at all this , would you ? My tackle , the boat , all to catch a little old fish just minding its usiness on the bottom of the lake . He gives Sam a look
ATHENA: From back in Houston . We both come up on Fifth Street .
PRISCILLA: We 're not running a dating service here .
ATHENA: I know that , Sergeant . We were just dancing . There was a bunch of us there . Shadow just come down looking for trouble .
CLIFF: It 's not our job to get involved in your personal life , but when it interferes with the training here
ATHENA: I 'm sorry , Sergeant Major . There was n't anything I could do . Shadow gets crazy
CLIFF: He 'll live .
PRISCILLA: He 'll be transferred to a military hospital as soon as he 's stabilized
CLIFF: He 'll probably be getting a medical discharge
ATHENA: Out of the Army ?
CLIFF: He 's going to lose a lung . This is not good news for Athena
ATHENA: Will this go on my record ? Cliff considers for a long moment
CLIFF: If the incident happened the way you say it did , there has n't been an infraction .
ATHENA: Thank you , Sergeant Major .
CLIFF: You 're dismissed .
ATHENA: Thank you , Sergeant Major .
PRISCILLA: You spoil 'em , Cliff .
CLIFF: Heyshe 's in a tough situation . I cut her some slack
PRISCILLA: But I 'm the one in charge of he sorry ass .

SAM: Mrs. Bledsoe ?
MINNIE: That 's me .
SAM: I 'm Sheriff Deeds
MINNIE: Sheriff Deeds ' dead , honeyyou just Sheriff junior .
SAM: Yeah , that 's the story of my life .
MINNIE: You ever play one of these ?
SAM: I 've seen 'em .
MINNIE: Well , do n't ever start up on 'em , cause once you do you ca n't stop . I tell myself I 'm gon na play just three little games after breakfast , and here I sit with half the day gone .
SAM: You mind if I ask a few questions about your husband ? Roderick ?
MINNIE: I wo n't say nothing bad about the man , but you can ask away .
SAM: He had the club out on the old trail oad
MINNIE: We run that twenty-odd years . Give it over to Otis Payne in 1967 . April .
SAM: So you must remember Sheriff Wade .
MINNIE: Not if I can help it .
SAM: You had to deal with him in running the club .
MINNIE: Them days , you deal with Sheriff Wade or you did n't deal at all . First of the month , every month , he remind you of who you really workin ' for .
SAM: He squeezed money out of you ?
MINNIE: Was n't legal to sell liquor in a glass back then unless you was a club , see . Roderick used to say , `` Buy yourself a drink , you get a free membership . '' But Sheriff Wade , he could shut you down anytime .
SAM: And my father ?
MINNIE: Sheriff Buddy was a different story . Long as Roderick throw his weight the right way on election day , make sure all the colored get out to vote- we was called colored back then , if you was politemaybe throw a barbecue for the right people now and then , things was peaceful . That Sheriff Wade , though , he took an awful big ite .
SAM: People did n't complain ?
MINNIE: Not if they was colored or Meskin . Not if they wanted to keep breathin ' .
SAM: Do you remember the last time you saw him ? Minnie thinks , puts down the Gameboy
MINNIE: I seen him in our place the last week before he gone missin ' .

WADE: One of Cleroe Payne 's boys ?
YOUNG OTIS: Uh-huh .
WADE: I sent your Daddy to the farm once .
YOUNG OTIS: I know that .
WADE: Why you think that was ?
YOUNG OTIS: Some crop needed pickin ' and the man was shorthanded .
WADE: As I remember it was because he had a sassy mouth on him . Must run in the familyYou would n't be runnin ' numbers out of this club , now , would you , son ?
YOUNG OTIS: Runnin ' numbers illegal .
WADE: Runnin ' numbers without I know about it is both illegal and unhealthy . You remember that . The beer is poured . Otis starts away
YOUNG HOLLIS: I prefer it in the bottle
WADE: Shut up , Hollis . Pour .
YOUNG OTIS: Been away . Up to Houston .
WADE: Houston , huh ? I hear they let you oys run wild up there .
YOUNG OTIS: You spilt it , you wipe it up .
WADE: I told you to do something . Are you gon na hop to it , or are we gon na have a problem ?
RODERICK: Do n't mind him , Sheriff . Boy 's just a bit slow , is all . He do n't mean nothin ' by it
WADE: That the problem , son ? You Slow ?
RODERICK: Otis , apologize to the Sheriff
WADE: You telling me what to do , Roderick ?

WADE: You learn how to act your place , son . This id n't Houston . He stands and we FOLLOW him toward the bar
OTIS: I did n't understand the spot I was putting Roderick in .
SAM: And that was the last time you saw him ?
OTIS: OhI think he came in one more time with Hollis andnaw , your Daddy was n't with them . Made their monthly pickup . Roderick was n't in so I just kept my mouth good and shut and handed over that envelope .
SAM: That was the night he disappeared ?
OTIS: Could of been . That was white people 's usiness .
SAM: And when my father was Sheriff ?
OTIS: What about it ?
SAM: What was your deal with him ? Otis smiles , chooses his words carefully
OTIS: Buddy was more a part of the big picturecounty political machine , chamber of commerce , zoning board if I kept those people happy , he was pretty much on my side . Whenever somebody thoughtthey start up another bar for the black folks , they 'd behow should I put this ? They 'd be officially discouraged .
SAM: He ever accept cash for a favor ?
OTIS: I do n't recall a prisoner ever died in your father 's custody . I do n't ecall a man in this townBlack , White , Mexicanwho 'd hesitate a minute before they 'd call on Buddy Deeds to solve a problem . More than that I would n't like to say .
AMADO: If you had your way I would n't have any friends .
PILAR: Oh , come on , Amado
AMADO: Just 'cause I 'm not like Little Miss Honor Roll here
PILAR: Leave your sister out of it .
AMADO: You and all of the teachers in this dumpyour story 's over , so you do n't want anybody else to have fun . We see on PILAR 's face that he has scored
PALOMA: You jerk
AMADO: I 'm not talking to you . You do n't have any friends .
PALOMA: Who 'd want to be friends with that unch of pachuco wannabes ?
AMADO: I do n't pretend I came over on the Mayflower
PALOMA: And those stupid girls who hang out with them
AMADO: Just shut up .
PALOMA: Not if you have half a brain in you head .
PILAR: Of course you can .
PALOMA: What ?
PILAR: It does n't have anything to do with eing smart .
JORGE: What I 'm saying is , I do n't see the point . You had your chance when the dedication committee was meeting
DANNY: I 've got new information
JORGE: There was a bill from the state legislature
DANNY: Families were split apart , a whole community was destroyed
SAM: You finished ?
DANNY: Look , I 'm not after you , Sam . I just think people in town ought to know the full story on Buddy Deeds .
SAM: That makes two of us .
DEL: Otis Payne was never embarrassed about a thing in his life .
CHET: Dad

CHET: Dad ?
DEL: `` Hey , Delmore , where 's your Daddy ? ''

MERCEDES: Donde estan sus guantes ? Tonta ! Quiere matar a mis clientes ?
PILAR: Maybe you 're just getting less patient .
MERCEDES: If they 're going to survive here , they have to know how to work , Elalco ! Adelante ! Los clientes esperan !
PILAR: Well , you hire illegals
MERCEDES: Nobody is illegal in my cafe ! They 've got green cards , they 've got relatives who were born hereif they only had a little common sense I 'd be very happy .
PILAR: If you spent a little more time training them
MERCEDES: Did you come here to tell me how to un my business ?
PILAR: No . I was wondering if you 'd like to take a trip down south with us . Maybe see where you grew up
MERCEDES: Why would I want to go there ?
PILAR: Oh , come onyou must be curious how it 's changed . Amado is into this big Tejano roots thing and I 've neve een further than Ciudad Leon
MERCEDES: You want to see Mexicans , open you eyes and look around you . We 're up to our ears in them .
PILAR: Mami , how old were you when my father
MERCEDES: He was killed .
PILAR: Right . When he was killed .
MERCEDES: A little older than Paloma is now .
PILAR: How come you never got married again ? Mercedes just glares at her
MERCEDES: I was too busy .
PILAR: Nobody 's too busy .
MERCEDES: Maybe now . It was different back then . I had this place , I was doing all the shopping , all the cooking . What do I need some chulo with grease under his nails to drink up the profit ?
PILAR: Thank you .
MERCEDES: I do n't mean Fernando .
PILAR: Mami , the first time I brought him home , those were your exact words `` some chulo with grease under his nails . ''
MERCEDES: I never said that .
PILAR: You made it pretty damn clear you thought he was nobody .
MERCEDES: I felt that you could do better fo yourself
PILAR: What ? Become a nun ? You did n't want me going out with Anglos

PILAR: `` That boy '' Mami , say his name fo chrissakes !
MERCEDES: You people are stealing my money Entiende ? Robandome ?
GIRL: Su madre ?
PILAR: Si .
GIRL: Lo siento
CODY: Now I 'm just as liberal as the next guy
SAM: If the next guy 's a redneck .
CODY: but I got ta say I think there 's something to this cold climate usiness . I mean , you go to the beach- what do you do ? Drink a few beers , wait for a fish to flop up on the sand . Ca n't build no civilization that way . You got a hard winte coming , though , you got to plan ahead , and that gives your cerebral cortex a workout .
SAM: Good deal you were born down here , then .
CODY: You joke about it , Sam , but we are in a state of crisis . The lines of demarcation has gotten fuzzyto run a sucessfull civilization you got to have lines of demarcation between ight and wrong , between this one and that oneyour Daddy understood that . He was like the whatchacallit the referee for this damn menudo we got down here . He understood how most people do n't want their suga and salt in the same jar .
SAM: You mixed drinks bad as you mix metaphors , you be out of a job .
CODY: Take that pair over in the corner Sam swivels to look where Cody points
SAM: Yeah . I bet he would .
CODY: Old Sam stood for somethin ' , you know ? The day that man died they oke the goddamn mold .
PRISCILLA: So where does that put us ?
CLIFF: WellI do n't see what 's changed . No - PDA 's , no necking on the obstacle course .
PRISCILLA: Seriously .
CLIFF: Seriously , I think we should get married .
PRISCILLA: We been through this before
CLIFF: We should just do it .
PRISCILLA: And if I get a shot at a promotion somewhere
CLIFF: You could take it
PRISCILLA: It 's up or out these days , Cliff . Say I get transferred to a different post
CLIFF: I 'd quit the Army for you , if it came to that .
PRISCILLA: Man 's gon na retire in two years and he offer to quit . Big goddamn deal .
CLIFF: Sheriffhithis is Sergeantthis is Priscilla Worth .
SAM: Pleased to meet you .
CLIFF: Sheriff Deeds was in on ou archeological find yesterday .
PRISCILLA: It true they gon na build a shopping mall out there ?
SAM: If certain people have their way , it 's going to be a new jail .
PRISCILLA: Damn . Maybe we got in the wrong usiness . They closin ' down military ases left and right , puttin ' up jails like 7-11 stores .
SAM: Do either of you have any idea when they stopped using that site as a ifle range ?
CLIFF: They stopped training infantry there in the late '50s . It was just a playground for the jackrabbits till they gave it to the county last year .
PRISCILLA: You know who it was they dug up ?
SAM: Not for sure yet . But I kind of wish they had n't .
ENRIQUE: Es muy lindo , su coche
MERCEDES: En ingles Enrique . This is the United States . We speak English .

OTIS: Carolynknock that off for a minute .
DEL: Black Seminoles ?
OTIS: Hobby of mine . Got some artifacts , couple pieces one of your men out at the base made . Free admission . Del nods toward where Carolyn is mopping
DEL: That where he was shot ?
OTIS: That 's where he fell .
DEL: You get much of that in here ?
OTIS: It 's a bar . People come together , drink , fall in love , fall out of love , air their grudges out
DEL: Deal drugs in the bathroom
OTIS: If I thought it would help I 'd put up a sign telling them not to . Right under the one about the employees washing their hands .
DEL: Nice to meet you , Ma'am . Carolyn nods , shoots a look to Otis
CAROLYN: I 'll be in back waiting for that delivery . They wail till she is gone to start again
OTIS: So .
DEL: So tell me why I should n't make this place off-limits .
OTIS: This is an official visit , then
DEL: I assume a lot of your business is from our people .
OTIS: Your boys out there cooped up together , need somewhere they can let the steam out . If they 're Black , there 's not but one place in this town they feel welcome . Been that way since before you were born .
DEL: We have an enlisted man 's club at the post .
OTIS: Well , you 're the Man out there now , are n't you ? It 's your call .
DEL: That 's right .
OTIS: I been hearing rumors about this new commander coming for a couple weeks now . Boys say they heard he 's a real hard case . Spit-and-polish man . Full- ird colonel name of Payne , they say Bet you never figured you end up ack here .
DEL: The Army hands you a command , you go wherever it is .
OTIS: Right .
DEL: I hear things , too . People call you the Mayor of Darktown .
OTIS: Over the years , this is the one place that 's always been there . I loan a little money out , settle some arguments . Got a cot in the back- people get afraid to go home they can spend the night . There 's not enough of us to run anything in this town- the white people are mostly out on the lake now and the Mexicans hire each other . There 's the Holiness Church and there 's Big O 's place .
DEL: And people make their choice
OTIS: A lot of 'em choose both . There 's not like a borderline between the good people and the bad peopleyou 're not either on one side or the other Del looks away , not wanting to believe this
DEL: Why would you want to do that ?
OTIS: Because I 'm your father .
DEL: You 'll get official notification when I make my decision . He is out the doorOtis pulls himself a bee as Carolyn steps back out
CAROLYN: So that 's him
OTIS: Yeahthat 's him . Got two , three thousand people under him out there , you count the civilians .
CAROLYN: That must be a laugh a minute .
SAM: Seems like we have another one every week .
JORGE: We 're building up tourism , Sam
SAM: People come here to catch bass and to get laid at the Boy 's Town in Cuidad Leon
JORGE: Sam
SAM: You ought to put up a banner `` Frontera , Texas Gateway to Cut- Rate Pussy ''
JORGE: I got Eddie Richter at the Sentinel to kill that story .
SAM: The Perdido thing ?
JORGE: He agreed it was n't exactly news
SAM: Danny 's gon na be out for blood the next time .
JORGE: There was a mandate in the last election
SAM: It would n't happen to be you construction company gon na get the id on building this thing , would it , H.L . And Jorge , you would n't be thinking about a couple dozen new jobs to dangle in front of the voters
JORGE: There is n't money allocated for that . But a jail
SAM: Look , I 'm not gon na campaign against your deal here , but if anybody asks me , I got to tell them the truth . We don'tneeda new jail .
SAM: Let 's get this thing over with .
MIKEY: Never thought I 'd see the day a buddy of mine was dating a woman with three up and three down on her shoulder .
CLIFF: I think it 's beyond what you 'd call dating .
MIKEY: You going to get married ?
CLIFF: Maybe .
MIKEY: You met her family ? They gon na be cool about you being a white guy ?
CLIFF: Priscilla says they think any woman over 30 who is n't married must be a lesbian . She figures they 'll be so elieved I 'm a man
MIKEY: Always heartwarming to see a prejudice defeated by a deeper prejudice . But marriage , manI did two tours in Southeast Asia and I was married fo five yearsI could n't tell you which experience was worse . Cliff picks up a slug
CLIFF: Hey , Mikey
MIKEY: I knew she was Japanese going into it , but she did n't tell me the ninja assassin part
CLIFF: Mikey
MIKEY: Her parents acted like I was gon na low my nose on their curtains
CLIFF: Mikey
MIKEY: If I stayed out past ten with the guys she 'd go into her Madame Butterfly routine
CLIFF: Mikey look at this
MIKEY: Whatit 's a bullet . I 'm lousy with ullets here .
CLIFF: It 's a .45 .
MIKEY: Yeah ?
CLIFF: This is the stuff we picked up the other day , right ? The rest of this is all .30 caliber
MIKEY: They were using M-1 's , yeah
CLIFF: What 's it doing on a rifle range ? MIKEY holds the slug in front of his face
MIKEY: We better call that Sheriff .
HOLLIS: Sometime in the early '70s a reporte from a national magazine was talking to the governor of our Lone Sta state , and he asked him , `` Governor , what 's your ideal of what a real Texan ought to be ? '' Governor said , `` That 's easy , son- you just go down to Rio County and get a look at Sheriff Buddy Deeds . '' Applause
HOLLIS: And now my fellow Council member and one of Frontera 's most respected usinesswomen , Mrs. Mercedes Cruz , will do the honors for us .
PILAR: Lunch hour . My next class is n't till nine-thirty .
SAM: Want to take a walk ?
PILAR: I ca n't name anybody she does like these days .
SAM: I see she built a place up here by the river .
PILAR: A real palace . She rattles around alone in that thing
SAM: She 's done well for herselfon he own and all
PILAR: So she tells me three times a week . She looks at him
SAM: They cooked the whole thing up without asking me .
PILAR: People liked him .
SAM: Most people did , yeah .
PILAR: I remember him watching me once . When I was littlebefore you and I She shrugs .
SAM: Yeah .
PILAR: Weird what you remember . They walk in silence a moment
SAM: Your boy , there
PILAR: Amado .
SAM: Nice-looking kid .
PILAR: He hates me .
SAM: No
PILAR: With Paloma , it 's more like she pities and tolerates me- totally age- appropriate . But Amadohe'she 's never been book-smart . Had a hard time learning to read . Me being a teacher and caring about those things is like an embarrassmentlike a etrayal .
SAM: Fernando did okay , and he dropped out
PILAR: Fernando was n't pissed off at everybody . He just wanted to fix their cars .
SAM: It might just be the age . I spent my first fifteen years trying to be just like Buddy and the next fifteen trying to give him a heart attack . She looks at him
PILAR: So why did you come back here , Sam ?
SAM: Got divorced , I was n't gon na work for my father-in-law anymore . The fellas down here said they 'd back me
PILAR: You do n't want to be Sheriff .
SAM: I got to admit it 's not what I thought it 'd be . Back When Buddy had it hell , I 'm just a jailer . Run a 60- oom hotel with bars on the windows .
PILAR: It can happen so sudden , ca n't it ? Being left out on your own .
SAM: You 've got your mother , your kids
PILAR: They 've got me . Different thing .
SAM: Remember this ?
PILAR: I should get back .

Beat Zach Taylor and a thousand troops at Lake Okeechobee .

BUNNY: Well , Daddy 's got his box at the stadium , of course , and I 'll fly to the Cowboy away games when they 're in the Conference . Then there 's the high school on Friday ' nights . West Side got a boy 6 ' 6 '' , 310 , moves like a cat . High school , we 're talkin ' . Guess how much he can bench-press ?
SAM: Bunny , youuhmyou on that same medication ?
BUNNY: Do I seem jumpy ?
SAM: No , you look good . I was just wondering .
BUNNY: Last year was awful roughMama passing on and the whole business with O.J.I mean it 's not like it was Don Meredith or Roger Staubach or one of our own boys , but it really knocked me for a loop
SAM: You look good
BUNNY: and that squeaker the Aggies dropped to Oklahoma-sonofabitch stepped in some lucky shit before he kicked that goal
SAM: Yeah , well
BUNNY: they had n't pulled me off that woman I would have jerked a knot in her .
SAM: You were in a fight
BUNNY: Daddy calls it an `` altercation . '' How you doing , Sam ? You look skinny .
SAM: Same weight I always was .
BUNNY: You look awful good in that uniform , though .
SAM: Best part of the job .
BUNNY: Daddy hired a pinhead to take you job . He says so himself . Says `` Even my son-in-law was better than this pinhead I got now '' .
SAM: Bunny , is that stuff I left in the garage still there ?
BUNNY: Least he never called me that . With me , it was always `` high-strung . '' `` My Bunny might have done something with her life , she was n't so high-strung . '' Or `` tightly wound , '' that was anothe one . You seeing anyone ?
SAM: No . You ?
BUNNY: Yeah . Sort of . Daddy rounds 'em up . You are n't talking about money , thei eady little eyes go dead .
SAM: You didn'tuhmyou did n't have one of your fires , did you ? The stuff I left in the garagesome of it was my father 's
BUNNY: You watch the draft this year ? 'Course you did n't , idiot question . They try to make it dramatic , like there 's some big surprise who picks who in the first round ? Only they been working it over with their experts and their computers for months . Doctor 's reports , highlight reels , coaches ' evaluations , psychological profileshell , I would n't be surprised if they collected stool samples on these boys , have 'em analyzed . All this stuff to pick a football player for your squad . Compared to that , what you know about the person you get married to do n't amount to diddly , does it ?
SAM: Suppose not .
BUNNY: You kind of bought yourself a pig in a poke , did n't you , Sam ? All that time we were first seeing each othe you did n't know I was tightly wound
SAM: It was n't just you , Bunny .
BUNNY: No , it was n't , was it ? You did n't exactly throw yourself into it heart and soul , did you ?
SAM: What ?
BUNNY: This boy from West Side , plays tackle oth ways . Bench-presses 350 pounds . You imagine having that much weight on top of you ? Pushing down ? Be hard to breathe . Hard to swallow .
SAM: I think they have another fella there to keep it off your chest . A spotter .
BUNNY: `` I only got my little girl now , '' he says , `` she 's my lifeline . '' Then he tells me I ca n't be in the box anymore if I ca n't control myself . Sonofabitch do n't even watch the damn game , just sits there drinking with his bidness friends , look up at the TV now and then . I do better to sit in the cheap seats with some real football people .
SAM: You look good , Bunny . It 's nice to see you .
BUNNY: Thanks . I like it when you say that , Sam .

You got a problem ? Buddy 'll fix it . Facing some time in jail ? Buddy 'll knock half of it off if you do what he says , when he says . You got some business that 's not exactly legal ? Talk to Buddy
HOLLIS: Buddy Deeds
SAM: Buddy Deeds was a murderer .
OTIS: I was here .
OTIS: Sheriff Charley had some real big friends in politics then , and if the truth come out it was n't going to go easy on Hollis . I do n't know why I trusted Buddy with itdo n't know why he trusted me . The first time I ever talked with him was right there , and then with a dead white man leakin ' blood on the floor between us . He could charm the scales off a rattler , Buddy Deeds .
HOLLIS: The three of us cleaned up and took him to the post and put him under . Ca n't say I was much help .
SAM: And the ten thousand ?
HOLLIS: Widow 's benefits . He figured it would make the disappearance look better , and that Mexican gal was just scrapin ' y after Charley killed her man . They did n't get hooked up till late
OTIS: Time went on , people liked the story that we told better than anything the truth might have been .
HOLLIS: What 's the call , Sam ?
SAM: Do n't think the Rangers are likely to find out any more than they already have .
HOLLIS: Word gets out who that body was , people are gon na think Buddy done it . Sam gets up
SAM: Buddy 's a goddamn legend . He can handle it . He heads for the door
PILAR: When 's the picture start ? Sam looks at her for a moment

SAM: You have any idea when your fathe died ? Eladio ?
PILAR: Couple months before I was born
SAM: Try a year and a half . He bands he an old snapshot . PILAR looks at it
PILAR: I 've never seen my mother in a athing suit before . Did n't know she owned one .
SAM: Buddy bought the cafe for her with money he took from the county . Pilar looks away , struggling not to cry
PILAR: They ca n't pull this on me . It is n't fairI do n't believe this
SAM: He paid the hospital bill when you were born . Your mom always calls you `` our beautiful daughter '' in the letters she wrote to him .
PILAR: From the first time I saw you at schoolall those years we were married to other people I always felt like we were connected .
SAM: I remember thinking you were the one part of my life Buddy did n't have a piece of
PILAR: So that 's it ? You 're not going to want to be with me anymore ?
SAM: If I met you for the first time today , I 'd still want to be with you . It is what Pilar needed to hear
PILAR: We start from scratch
SAM: Yeah
PILAR: Everything that went before , all that stuff , that historythe hell with it , right ? PILAR takes Sam 's hand , kisses him

SAMANTHA: Hmm ? Uh , no . Just more clothes .
HENESSEY: Yeah , well take a look at this .
NATHAN: Alice , please ? Alice stares at him . Uncomprehending .
ALICE: What 's wrong with the dog ?
NATHAN: It 's simple . He 's been licking his asshole for three straight hours . I submit to you that there 's nothing there worth more than an hour 's attention , and I should think whateve he 's attempting to dislodge is eithe gone for good or there to stay . *Would n't you agree* ?
SAMANTHA: You tell me , Mr. Windeman . Nathan pales . Blinks once . Twice . Manages

HENESSEY: How the fuck can you tell ? She steadies the rifle . Takes aim .
SAMANTHA: I read lips . She fires . Splintered CRACK- !
PRESIDENT: *Mister Perkins* . Please , say it again , I 'm a little slow . Better yet , I 'll try it . You lost an operative , a trained counterassassin , and you just saw her on TV in a Christmas parade .
CIA DIRECTOR: Mr. President , please calm down . The CIA bears no responsibility for this problem .
PRESIDENT: Thanks for sharing , Kent . How many double agents you got on the payroll , last count ?
CIA DIRECTOR: Sir ! That controversy has been thoroughly dealt with , and if there still exists a leak , perhaps this woman agent of his
PRESIDENT: Yes , yes . I believe you . Just one question *What in pluperfect hell is she doing in a Christmas parade* ? ? ?
HENESSEY: Aw , cut me a break , Fran . I been out eight months , I 'm back doing skip traces , now you got me stealing fuckin ' bicycles ?
SAMANTHA: I still ca n't believe it . You 're saying my hands did n't even shake ?
HENESSEY: You . You 're the matter . Look , you wan na keep going , good luck . I 'm driving back to Ohio . You 're free to come with me .

SAMANTHA: I 'll spell it out for you , ready ? I have no future , *I ca n't go home* . Until I know what 's happening , I 'm in *prison* , you know how that feels ?
HENESSEY: Yeah , matter of fact . Four years inside . Marion , Illinois , real shithole . Get in the car .
SAMANTHA: I 'm sorry . Um what did you ?
HENESSEY: Seven years ago , Atlanta PD . Me and my partner , we handled a lot of impounded shit . Fucker hated me , oy . One weekend , when he was conveniently gone ?

SAMANTHA: I just got a flash of something ,

HENESSEY: *Jesus wept* !
NATHAN: Get in ! Both of you , NOW !
TIMOTHY: East , they 're going east . *Head them off* .
NATHAN: Charly . Jesus Christ , I do n't believe what I 'm seeing , you 're so *fat* . This is not what she expected to hear .
SAMANTHA: I 'm um , I mean what ?

SAMANTHA: My name is Caine . Samantha Caine .
NATHAN: Yes , yes , you said that on the phone . *Must* I point out to you that the letters in the name SAM CAINE , when earranged , spell out AMNESIAC ? You mind was missing a name , so it simple invented one that was an anagram of your current condition . Samantha reacts , floored .
SAMANTHA: It 's not a fantasy , *I 'm in the fucking PTA* .

NATHAN: *The side windows were next , I swear* .
SAMANTHA: My God . How many do you carry ?
NATHAN: Three . One shoulder , one hip , and one right next to Mr. Wally Where most patdowns never reveal it , as an agent is often reluctant to feel up another man 's groin . Henessey looks out the back windshield , says
HENESSEY: Got a tail .
NATHAN: Lucky bastard found the only cool car in the fucking midwest .
SAMANTHA: Would you lay off the weight ?
NATHAN: I think we can safely assume Daedalus is aware of your resurrection and is attempting to reverse it . *Damn* , I ca n't drive around in this thing . Any idea where we can go to stash this car ?
SAMANTHA: This address ? I I recognize it now . I think it belongs to a friend .

NATHAN: *No ambulance* . The car I ordered will be here soon .
SAMANTHA: Mr. Windeman , please let him help you . I know this man , I I 'm pretty sure I slept with him . Nathan presses a bandage to his side .

HENESSEY: Cut me a break , nimrod . She 's married with a kid . Busted . Nathan coughs . Speaks , eyes faraway
NATHAN: My star pupil That man in Pennsylvania yesterday The one at the diner , that was hers , was n't it ?
HENESSEY: How 'd you know ?
NATHAN: I saw the news report , they found a shell casing a thousand yards away , helluva shot .
HENESSEY: Tell me about Daedalus , what 's his story ?
NATHAN: Arms broker , man without a face . Veteran of Baader-Meinhoff and the Red Brigades . He 's rumored to be ased in the U.S . Does n't travel much , they say . Too afraid of metal detectors , the poor sod 's got a foot- long piece of steel in his leg . At which point , Henessey stops . Frowns .
HENESSEY: Come again ?
NATHAN: A pin , Mr. Henessey . A surgical pin .
HENESSEY: Where the hell ? I know I just heard that somewhere , something about a His eyes widen
NATHAN: You blithering idiot , the son of a itch was n't her lover , he was he target , he 's Daedalus !
HENESSEY: Oh , Jesus ! That 's how she knew all that shit , not from *dating* him she *studied* the fucker to take him out !
LUKE: Sure do n't look like an ambulance , does it ?
BRIGADIER: the bombing has been linked to the Ulster Volunteer Force , which , as you know , is the counterpart of the provisional IRA and the most violent of the Protestant Paramilitary groups . An ANNOUNCER 's face replaces him
ANNOUNCER: Despite threats of reprisals , Brigadier Baltimore repeats that he will seek to cut UVF supply lines , especially from Tripoli , Lybia . U.S. President Nixon concurs that
GREGORY: You 've never made it with a boy , then ?
GIRL: There 's nothing odd about it . I 'm only sixteen .
GREGORY: Rubbish .
GIRL: What ?
GREGORY: You 're fourteen and not a day more . Here now , I 'm right , you 're blushing .
GIRL: Look , what if I 'm ignorant ? It 's my father , we never stay in one place , I never meet bloody anyone .
GREGORY: Saw him on the telly . Think he 'd kill me ? I 'm a nasty one , I am .
GIRL: *DA* !
BRIGADIER: How much He raises the pistol to his head .
DAEDALUS: Well , good afternoon . If it is n't the forgetful spy . How you feeling ?
SAMANTHA: Not-so fresh .
TIMOTHY: Look at her . She 's not faking it , she does n't know me from Adam . Daedalus shakes his head , frowning
DAEDALUS: It 's not that I do n't trust my compatriot , Colonel Baltimore . In fact , I had every confidence that your amnesia was genuine until you showed up *here* . You follow ? Meanwhile , I just got around to eading the papers , there 's the small matter of an incident upstate . Long ange rifle shot , blew a man out of his socks . You can see where I 'm coming from . I 'm trying to pull of the biggest job of my career . I have to know . How much you really remember and who you 've told .
SAMANTHA: I did n't tell a soul , I swear .
DAEDALUS: We 'll soon know .
SAMANTHA: Is is this a torture thing ?
DAEDALUS: Torture , yes . The torturing of eautiful women , albeit politically incorrect , is an addiction with me . A woman never looks quite so beautiful as when her face is distended in pain . Witness the beauty of childbirth .
SAMANTHA: Please , I 'm getting all misty . Look , untie me , I 'll make any face you want .
DAEDALUS: Let 's not , and say we did . Do you smoke ?
SAMANTHA: Smoke ? Um , no . Not not really .

TIMOTHY: You do n't remember *at all* ? The greatest night of your life , shit , drown this ungrateful wench .
DAEDALUS: Talk to me Colonel . Is my identity safe ? The truth , and I 'll shoot you in the head . Nice and quick . Otherwise , you 're in for a long night . *Who did you talk to* ?
SAMANTHA: Nobody fuck you
DAEDALUS: Hate to see you like this , Charly . I heard you were a helluva spy once .
SAMANTHA: Watch your back . I 'm not done yet .
DAEDALUS: That 's a very funny joke . You 're an entertaining woman . Good night .
TIMOTHY: Okay , I 'll signal Daedalus . You money will be waiting , and Jack ? Do yourself a favor , do her and dump her , I 'm serious . Do n't get cute , try to play doctor first . I made that mistake . The lid SLAMS SHUT .
CHARLY: Daedalus Make you a deal Let me go now ? I 'll leave you the use of your legs Bargain , trust me Daedalus struggles to recover his poise .
DAEDALUS: How did you find me ? Who knows about this place , WHO HAVE YOU TOLD ? Charly 's eyes bore into his
CHARLY: I let you touch me , cowboy I think I need a bath .
DAEDALUS: Samantha Please !
CHARLY: Who 's Samantha ?
PERKINS: This ca n't happen , Harry . The President 's already up at night , prowling his sock drawer for double agents , and now we 've got a fucking ogue on our hands .
HARRY: Sir , there 's someone in the conference oom to see you .
PERKINS: Oh , for the love of Christ , who can e so fucking important ?
TIMOTHY: It 's me , your poor black cousin . The one you ca n't be seen with .
PERKINS: *You* ! Are you crazy , coming here ? ?
TIMOTHY: My boss is dead .
PERKINS: What ?
TIMOTHY: Your rogue bitch just took him out . Probably went shopping in his weapons storage too .
SWITCHBOARD: You have a call on line three , sir .
PERKINS: Who is it ?
SWITCHBOARD: Charly Baltimore , sir .
PERKINS: Perkins .
CHARLY: It 's cold , I want to come in .
PERKINS: Charly ? Oh , my God , what the hell are you *doing* ? Listen to me , I 'm going to direct you to a safe house , get you on a plane
CHARLY: Can the bullshit , I 'm not telling you where I am . I 'll come in for a full debriefing , but we do it my way .
PERKINS: Charly , you 're being paranoid . It 's not like it used to be , you 're eight years out of date .
CHARLY: Do tell .
PERKINS: Congress wo n't authorize a dime , Charly . Chapter 's on the way out , we 've been reduced to a records- keeping agency , we *do n't have enough money to kill you* , understand ?
CHARLY: Fuck you , Perkins . If you want me dead , you 'll pass a hat in the typing pool to buy bullets . We do things my way .
PERKINS: Your way , I see . And if I say go to hell ?
CHARLY: From where I stand , it ai n't much of a commute . You 'll hear from me .
PERKINS: She must n't threaten our success . Contain her , whatever it takes . But e *careful* . If it gets out you 're working for me we 'll both be grabbing our ankles on the White House lawn .
CHARLY: Hey , Mitch . Glad you 're awake . Uh- oh , you 're seeping . She grabs a washcloth . Frowns , says
HENESSEY: Ah , that hurt like shit ! !
CHARLY: That 's why I distracted you first . Same principle as breaking in virgins .
HENESSEY: Same as virgins , *what* ?
CHARLY: Saw it in a Harold Robbins book . Guy ites her on the ear as he goes in . Distracts from the pain . You eve try that ?
HENESSEY: No , I slug 'em in the jaw and yell `` pop goes the weasel , '' what the fuck are you talking about ? Who are you ? ?
CHARLY: Name 's Charly . The spy . Nice to meet'cha . Drink ?
HENESSEY: I 'm confused . Gim me a minute .
CHARLY: Take two , they 're small .
HENESSEY: Okay . Let 's say I buy it . You 're actually a trained killer , Jesus , I ca n't even say it with a straight face . So then Samantha , she
CHARLY: Never really existed . Like Nathan said , she was a total fabrication , I made her up .
HENESSEY: Fabrication . And now she 's just gone ? Forever and ever ?
CHARLY: Thank God . Look at my inordinately large ass , look what she did to me .
HENESSEY: Pretty convincing act .
CHARLY: Guess so .
HENESSEY: I mean , her personality , it had to come from *somewhere*
CHARLY: Change the subject . Better yet , steal me another drink .
HENESSEY: Drink up . What 's next ?
CHARLY: I called Chapter . I 'm trying to bring us in from the field alive
HENESSEY: Chapter . Can you trust them ?
CHARLY: Not sure . Until I know , you might wan na stay away from curbs . He looks at her , confused
SANTA CLAUS: Hey , lady , Santa want to dance the lambada wit'choo . *Come this way , everybody* ! He shimmies away . Charly grins at Henessey
CHARLY: If I could come that way I would n't need to dance the lambada . Follow me , I need you to do something .
HENESSEY: The lady 's whacked , Trin , she 's lost it and I want fucking out , now *call the Feds* . She 's moving us tonight , I 'll sneak out to this phone , call you back at midnight with the details .
CHARLY: I 'm testing our boy Perkins . I figure he 's got ta be tapping your office . Got a light ?
HENESSEY: Oh , no . He just traced that call ? She swipes matches from his pocket . Nods .
CHARLY: Come midnight , you hang by the phone . Nobody shows , we think about trusting him . He tries to kidnap and torture you , well , there it is .
HENESSEY: Whoa , time out .
CHARLY: Oh , do n't be such a baby . Ten o'clock , we got two hours to kill . I 'm a woman , feed me .
HENESSEY: `` Charly . '' fucking unbelievable . Shame about the fat ass . I bet you were really attractive once .
CHARLY: Oh , I was . Check this out . One time ? A guy said he 'd fuck me .
HENESSEY: No .
CHARLY: Swear to God .
HENESSEY: Did he make good ?
CHARLY: Absolutely . Oh , and afterwards ? Oh my God , afterwards I said the most funny thing , you know what I said ? I said , `` Go back to your room . Dad ''
HENESSEY: Your father was murdered .
CHARLY: When Da died , I went to his funeral . 12 years old , today I would n't . And I overheard a woman , she was praying She was thanking God sounded so happy thanking Him it had n't been *her* father who was killed . See she did n't really care that God had let someone die just so long as it missed *her* . and she bought her cross at the same store as mine , see , that 's what we do , we all pray to the same cross on a hundred different walls , and sit back and wait to see who gets hit and who gets missed .
HENESSEY: Okay , what 's going on ?
CHARLY: True love , shut the fuck up .
HENESSEY: You kidding me ? I 'm an ex-con , lady . I wear a shiny suit , my tie 's crooked , and the last time I got blown candy ars cost a nickel . Plus I 'm ugly , so what 's up ?
CHARLY: Chemistry . Be quiet .
HENESSEY: Chemistry my ass . Know what I think ? I think this is why you 'd fuck me . To kill a schoolteacher . Bury any trace of her . He pushes her away .
CHARLY: I did n't ask for the kid , Mitch . Samantha had the kid , not me , NOBODY
BEARDED MAN: Good evening .
CHARLY: Fuck off .
BEARDED MAN: I see me a good-looking lady , all upset , I wonder if she does n't need some male company .
CHARLY: Forget it . I 'm saving myself 'til I get raped .
BEARDED MAN: Step into the alley , honey . I ai n't asking , I 'm telling .
CHARLY: Oh , do n't tell me . You 're early , Goddammit , you 're supposed to be at the pay phone . Go away and come back at midnight . I 'm not ready yet . Got a light ? The guy stares , mouth working .
BEARDED MAN: Lady , I have a gun !
CHARLY: What the hell are you doing here ?
HENESSEY: Saving your life . Woulda got here sooner but I was thinking up the sandwich line .
CHARLY: You think I could n't take him ? *Idiot* , you probably scared the other guy away
HENESSEY: What other guy ?
CHARLY: Headhunters , nimrod , they go in pairs , were you always this stupid or did you take lessons ?
HENESSEY: I TOOK LESSONS .
BEARDED MAN: Hey ! Charly snaps her head toward him

BEARDED MAN: I still got this fucking gun ! She smiles sweetly .
CHARLY: No , you do n't .

HENESSEY: Why did n't you say so ? Gim me a second while I pull it out of my ass .
CHARLY: The key , Mitch . The one I keep around my neck .
HENESSEY: What about it ?
CHARLY: What if I told you it 's the key to Box 406 at Pittsburgh International Airport ?
HENESSEY: How would you know ? Someone filed off the numbers .
CHARLY: Not someone . Me . I filed them off . There 's a briefcase in Box 406 , Mitch .
HENESSEY: What 's in it ?
CHARLY: $ 200,000 .
HENESSEY: Why me ?

DRIVER: Shit it really *is* you
CHARLY: Phil ? Phil Krauss ? I do n't believe it , they moved you from cyphers . Long time , man , I figured you were dead by now .

CHARLY: Excuse me ?
HENESSEY: Shut up and find me a gun . HK , MP-5 . As he rips open the bill we CUT TO
CHARLY: Verify you have her .
TIMOTHY: I 'll be in touch .
CHARLY: Give me an ANI trace . Do it .
TIMOTHY: It 's done , she hooked . All I got ta do is set the ransom meet .
PERKINS: She must n't suspect a trap .
TIMOTHY: No way . She thinks I 'm acting alone , emember ? Say the word , I 'll hand her to you on a plate .
PERKINS: God . We 're monsters , are n't we ? Forget Charly . Talk to me about tonight .
TIMOTHY: The tanker 's on its way from Charleston , ETA 1 00 a.m. One terrorist on ice , waiting to play patsy . What 's in the sack ?
PERKINS: That ? Something to prove that I 'm not a complete ogre .
HENESSEY: Almost dark now .
CHARLY: Another ten minutes . You want my Crazy Meal action figure ?
HENESSEY: Pass . Listen , you sure we 're doing the right thing ? We 've got money , we could negotiate
CHARLY: *I 'll get the damn kid* , okay ? God , I hope he does n't shoot her up . Kid 's dead weight if she 's sedated .
HENESSEY: Not so emotional , I 'm getting embarrassed with these outbursts here .
CHARLY: Oh , balls . Want me to cry on cue ? I can . This is an extraction , nimrod , and she 's the target , that 's how to play it , the only way to beat this guy .
HENESSEY: Yeah ? How come you know so much about this fucking guy ?
CHARLY: Do n't go there , Mitch , you do n't want to know .
HENESSEY: I 'm here . Suppose you tell me .
CHARLY: Fine , you asked . I bumped pelvises with this guy . In Paris , back in
HENESSEY: What 's the matter ?
CHARLY: They 're here .
HENESSEY: Who ?
CHARLY: Fucking Chapter , that 's who . Timothy acting alone , Caitlin had a chance . Now ? She 's dead meat .
TIMOTHY: Fuck the cleaning , just drain it and eload . Chop-chop , I 'm going bunjee jumping after this .
HENESSEY: Let me go in .
CHARLY: Negative . You stomp around like a forties drunk and you 're a lousy shot .
HENESSEY: I get by .
CHARLY: You could n't hit a lake if you were standing on the bottom , now shut the fuck up .
HENESSEY: Come again ?
CHARLY: That 's what happened under the water . That night , eight years ago . She looks up at the sky . Face troubled .
HENESSEY: I was gon na say enjoy life , eat out more often .
CHARLY: Got ta go . If she 's alive , she 's coming out of there , Mitch . If she 's not they 'll know we stopped by . She 's gone , like a wraith . CUT TO
SENTRY: All clear .
HENESSEY: Christ , lady , what are you doing in there , playing fucking mah-jongg ? *Move* .
TIMOTHY: Bogey .
PERKINS: You know , Colonel , you ought really to have stayed dead . You do n't know the rules of the game anymore .
CHARLY: No shit . Eight years ago , you send me to kill Daedalus and this clown . Now you 're working *with* him .
PERKINS: Budget cuts , remember ? Congress linded us in Eastern Europe , Central America . Across the board , an intelligence blackout . We had to ecruit any eyes and ears we could find , even if it meant going to forme targets .
CHARLY: Budget cuts oh , God . Is *that* what this is about ? The foot soldiers , the tanker truck Fuck me , you 're running a fundraiser ! !
PERKINS: Interesting theory .
CHARLY: Theory , my ass . I think some terrorists were planning a strike . Bought supplies from Daedalus , that 's how you knew they were coming No way . Do n't tell me you 're gon na sit there and let them go through with it , *just to get a budget increase* . Perkins shrugs philosophically .
PERKINS: It 's not without precedent . 1993 , emember the World Trade Cente ombing ? The CIA had advance knowledge , do n't think they did n't . Worse , the diplomat who issued the terrorist 's visa was CIA , they *facilitated* the bombing . Purely to justify a budget increase . Of course , they 'd no way of knowing the terrorists would botch the job .
CHARLY: That 's not gon na happen this time ?
PERKINS: No . This time , the terrorist event will come off precisely as planned . This time the terrorists ca n't muck it up because we 've killed them and taken over . Charly and Henessey react , startled
POCK: Found these buried around the perimeter .
TIMOTHY: Make sure you get all of them .
CHARLY: So what 's the plan ? What 's going out in the tanker ?
TIMOTHY: You wan na know the plan ?
HENESSEY: Are you fucking insane ? You 're talking about 10,000 people ! !
CHARLY: Easy , Mitch . How you gon na blame it on terrorists ?
TIMOTHY: Those roads are treacherous this time of year . When we dump a car to the bottom of a ravine , with the corpse of Imn Al Rahman in it get the picture ?
CHARLY: Listen to me , Timothy . Please . Let my kid go .
TIMOTHY: Why ? For old times ' sake ? She shakes her head
CHARLY: Goddamn you , *look at her eyes*
TIMOTHY: And why exactly should I do that ?
CHARLY: Because they 're yours , motherfucker . She stares Timothy full in the face .
TIMOTHY: Priceless . Ca n't believe it
CHARLY: She 's no risk , Timothy , *let he go* .
TIMOTHY: The freezer 's downstairs , Charly . Let 's get it done .
HENESSEY: I 'll wait for you to rescue me .
CHARLY: Be just a minute . Charly goes through the opening .
TIMOTHY: Shit , this place is loaded with fumes , nobody light a fucking match . You check her for flammables ?
GUN GUARD: Checked her for colon cancer . Caitlin is sitting in a chair .
CAITLIN: Mommy Charly composes herself .
CHARLY: Shhhhh . Mommy 's here , it 's okay . Safe and snug what comes next , huh ? What 's the next part ?
CAITLIN: bug in a rug man with white hair says the same thing you say
CHARLY: We 're going to take a nap together , Cate . You can have your dolly , and Mommy will be next to you , how 's that ? It 'll be like bears in winter . When they get cold , see , they fall deep , deep asleep
TIMOTHY: Bears , yeah , yeah . Enough .
CHARLY: You 're murdering us both , cocksucker , let the kid have her fucking dolly .
TIMOTHY: Chuck , I 'm not a total creep . I 'll make you a deal , okay ? There 's a knife in that box . Now , you and the kid , you 're going to freeze , *but* if you kill the kid *by your own hand* ? I wo n't kill your husband . Serious . We 're gon na open that doo and you 'll both be frozen solid , but I wan na know that you 've cut you own child 's throat .
CHARLY: It ai n't over , motherfucker . You 're gon na die screaming and I 'm gon na watch . Am I telling the truth ?
CAITLIN: Mom , it 's cold in here- !
CHARLY: Shhh . Just for a little bit . Pola ear , remember ?
TIMOTHY: Tell me where Charly keeps her money . She must have mentioned it .
HENESSEY: Get fucked , you dumb bastard . Charly called Washington , by morning this whole place 'll be crawling with Feds .
TIMOTHY: We 'll be gone by then , Mitch .
HENESSEY: Yeah , well , that 's what I 'm saying , there 's a couple Feds , they could n't sleep , said they might come early . Fuck you , someone 'll screw up . Just watch .
TIMOTHY: Already did , Mitch , someone already did . Perkins got stuck with a double agent , someone trusted , highly placed .
HENESSEY: Who ?
TIMOTHY: Me . Chinks are paying me to bring down Chapter . Henessey reacts , startled . Timothy chuckles
HENESSEY: The patsy .
TIMOTHY: Uh-uh . They find Chapter , caught with their pants down . See , Mitch , I dumped in a much faster chemical catalyst The tanker 's gon na blow *tonight* . In the center of town , thirty-five minutes from now .
CHARLY: Open . Reaches in her mouth . Takes out her RETAINER .
CAITLIN: Mommy ?
CHARLY: I love you , Caitlin , oh God , do you know how much I love you ?
CAITLIN: Am I gon na die ?
CHARLY: No , baby , you 're not gon na die . They are . She strikes a match .
TIMOTHY: Charly 's stash . What 's the number of the locker , Mitch ?
HENESSEY: Fuck you . TIMOTHY across the room , a good forty feet .
TIMOTHY: Left nut , five bucks I make it .
CHARLY: When I tell you , scream as loud as you can , or else your ears 'll get hurt .
HENESSEY: You foxy bitch .
TIMOTHY: Move it out of here , now !
CHARLY: *Run , Catey* .
CHARLY: Smart girl , honey . Stay still . Do n't make a sound . Snug as a bug in a ug
HENESSEY: Behind the big garage . Is Caitlin with you ?
CHARLY: No , but she 's safe for the moment , she stowed away on the tanker truck .
HENESSEY: Charly , Timothy rigged the tanker to go off early . We got fifteen minutes . No more . On her reaction we CUT TO
CHARLY: Tires wo n't pop , Mitch . Bastard just locked her in , she 's stuck in there and they 're leaving , *Goddammit* !
HENESSEY: All right , I 'll go in and get her , you watch my back .
CHARLY: No chance . I make it twelve , Mitch , automatic weapons .
HENESSEY: So kill 'em for me , bitch , Christ , what are you good for ?
CHARLY: The truck . How long til it blows ?
TIMOTHY: Sweet Loretta , you 're another animal entirely . Let 's see , 312 degrees Make it ten minutes , give or take .
CHARLY: Then I better hurry .

SETH: What do I do ? You 're the only friend I got Joe you got ta help me
JOE: You fucking idiot coming here . Seth , sucker punched .
SETH: Joe ? A little - where am I gon na -
JOE: You hop a freight train , you beat it the hell out
KID BLUE: Open up Joe ! Watch the window .
JOE: I ca n't do anything for you Seth .
SETH: No ! You got ta hide me ! Joe , hide me , please Christ please Joe please hide me tell em something to buy time and I 'll leave please-
JOE: Hold on !
KID BLUE: That took awhile .
JOE: You think it 's easy looking this good ?
KID BLUE: Tye 's going to watch your apartment while we go have a talk with Abe . Joe grabs a jacket .
JOE: There 's coffee in the tin .
TYE: Thank you .
KID BLUE: You know why they call that pea shooter a blunderbuss ? Cuz it 's impossible to hit anything farthe than 15 feet , and impossible to miss anything closer . A gun fo fuck up turkeys . Not like a gat . A gat has range . Accuracy .
JOE: Alright , cut it out Kid . You 're gon na blow your foot off again . The Kid almost snaps back , but then grins .
KID BLUE: You 're right , it 'd be real easy fo it to accidentally go off .
JOE: C'mon .
KID BLUE: Do n't disrespect a gat man , Looper . Joe stifles a chuckle .
ABE: Alright . Joe .
JOE: Dunno I agree with that .
ABE: Oh yeah ? Well . What the fuck did my great grandfather know .
JOE: Ties .
ABE: Ridiculous . You 're aware we do n't have a dress code .
SHRUGS: Fashion .
ABE: You know , you do n't know , the movies you 're dressing like were copying other movies . Goddamn 20th century affectations , do something new . Put a glowing thing around your neck or use rubberized.. Be new .
JOE: Okay . A beat of silence .
ABE: I do like you , Joe . But we 're sure enough Seth paid you a visit we 're gon na hafta do something about this .
JOE: Seth ?
ABE: You 're expecting we 're gon na break your fingers with a hammer o something awful , and I 'm going to diffuse that tension right now , that is n't going to happen . What 's going to happen is , I 'm going to talk for a little , not even that long , then you 're gon na give up your friend .
JOE: My friend Seth ? I 'm confused .
ABE: Well then I 'll talk a little . You know you were the youngest looper I ever hired ? You looked goddamn idiculous they said , the lunderbuss up to here on you . But I remember they brought you in , I forget what it was for ,
JOE: Watch shop .
ABE: That 's yeah , you had rolled one of our fronts , a watch shop . And they had you , your arms pinned , this kid . Like an animal . But you looked at me , your hair stuck to half your face so just this one eye looking at me . And I thought what 's this kid lived through , what he had taken away from him . What 's he lost . And I could see , like seeing it happen clear as seeing it , the bad path in front of you , the bad version of your life . Like a vision I saw it happen , you turning bad . So I cleaned you up and put a gun in your hand . I gave you something that was yours .
JOE: You know I 'm grateful , Abe .
ABE: I gave you something that was yours . And I remember that kid , and I think when you ask yourself you ask who would I sacrifice fo what 's mine , I think Seth is deep and cozy inside that circle .
JOE: Okay .
ABE: Show you how much I know you , I 'm not even gon na break you , just set you back a ways .
JOE: Will you kill him ?
ABE: No . Would be too cataclysmic a change to the future . What we 'll do is dangerous in that regard , but not as dangerous as killing him , and not by twice as having him run free .
BEAT: Joe I let him run more than a few days , the boys in the future get nervous , then bing ! my replacement shows up . With a gun . So we 'll do what we have to do . Silence .
JOE: Floor safe , beneath the rug . 6742 . One of the gat men quietly exits .
ABE: It 's the little ones that get you .
MADAME: Suzie 's just getting off . Doubt she 's up for it . He pushes through the velvet curtained door .
JOE: I ca n't remember my mother 's face . I remember her touching my hair . Like this .
SUZIE: Do I want to go overseas ? With you ? Now ?
JOE: Soon , maybe .
SUZIE: Baby that 's sweet . You 're a sweet oy . You got ta be careful , it 's easy to think you know someone once you been like this . What 's in here is services rendered .
JOE: Is that how it aughta be ?
SUZIE: What , in nature ?
BEAT: You know I get this a lot . Especially young guys . I must have wife eyes or something . His face clouds .
OLD SETH: No no no no no !
JOE: Oh god .
SOTTO: Do n't do it . Idiot . Do n't do it .
KID BLUE: Two more trips . They enter the building .
OLD JOE: Stupid little shit . He lifts him in his arms .
ABE: Maybe . Sweep the train yard . Every second that passes is bad , go .
KID BLUE: I ca n't hear you Abe leans in next to his ear and shouts
ABE: Well that 's what happens when you fire a gat in a steel box you stupid little shit .
KID BLUE: I can fix this . I can find him .
ABE: Go home and let the grown ups work . Kid Blue .
JOE: Where would I go if I were me .
BEATRIX: Coffee ?
OLD JOE: Please . Black . And water .
BEATRIX: Anything else ?
TO JOE: Are we eating ?
JOE: I ordered something .
OLD JOE: Steak and eggs , rare and scrambled .
BEATRIX: Two steak & eggs coming up .
OLD JOE: We 're not going to talk about time travel .
JOE: ok .
OLD JOE: Must hurt . His arm .
JOE: Yeah . Did n't know if you 'd
OLD JOE: I put it together . Clever .
BEAT: Do I get the scar when you 're cut , or when the knife is on its way down and it 's inevitable that you 're going to be cut ?
JOE: I 'm not cutting myself again to-
OLD JOE: I 'm not asking you to .
JOE: It 's an interesting question , I 've just lost a lot of blood today .
OLD JOE: You know there 's another girl here on weekends .
REALIZES: Sue .
OLD JOE: Well . Have fun explaining who â€˜Beatrix ' is for the next thirty years .
JOE: Good .
OLD JOE: ( fast in French ,
SUBTITLED: I know you have a gun between you legs . Joe 's face registers obvious incomprehension .
JOE: I do n't care what you 're here for , whatever you think you 're going to get from me . More time or whateve you want . I ca n't let you walk away from this diner alive . Because the next 30 years of my
OLD JOE: You know what the voice of god sounds like ? See now good you 're confused now but you 're listening . I hope the voice of god sounds like an old man speaking French . Old men speaking French sound like primeval trees in a strong wind , just irrefutable . Wise , strong , gentle , all these things in harmony , complimentary . At once . Old men speaking French . Young men speaking French sound , without exception , like weenies . Fact . You ever hear a Frenchman under 40 try to sound threatening ? It 's hilarious . English is a tight t- shirt , flatters the young . Rat a tat tat . French is a double easted suit . Young man can put it on , but it always feels like he 's putting something on . Some things , you just need the years . It 's my favorite language .
JOE: I 've got a life ahead of me that 's mine and I 'm not giving it up fo you or anybody
OLD JOE: Well you know what you have to do then why do n't you take your little gun out from between your knees and do it . One in the head , two in the heart . Boy . It 's all â€œanybodyâ€� and â€œneverâ€� and then you show up here and think you can talk me into dying . Well bullshit we both know you 're not going to kill me . Christ you ordered eggs . Old Joe downs two aspirin . Takes a breath .
BEAT: It 's hard to make eye contact with you . It 's too strange .
JOE: Your face looks backwards .
OLD JOE: Yeah , that helps actually . That little twist of unfamiliar .
BEAT: You 're not winning some pissing contest by looking me in the eye , you did n't know what I looked like until yesterday , it makes sense that it 's easier for you .
JOE: I was n't trying to . Do you know what 's going to happen ? Have you already done all this , right now , as me ?
OLD JOE: No not - exactly - I do n't want to talk about time travel shit , ecause we 'll start talking about it and then we 'll be here all day making diagrams with straws . It does n't matter .
JOE: When I hurt myself now , it changes your body . Do my actions change your memories ?
OLD JOE: It does n't matter because I do n't know how it works . Nobody knows how it works . Time travel was an accident , thirty years from now the smartest men in the world know exactly one thing about it that you do n't they know to be scared to death of it .
BEAT: My memory is cloudy , there 's a cloud . It 's a , it starts clea then gets cloudy as it goes back.. Goddammit hand me those . Straws . Joe passes him two .
THIS: is the present moment , right now .
AND THIS: is the moment thirty years from now when I was sent back . The machine is tuned to a fixed time , you know that , 30 some years , it 's not adjustable .
JOE: What 's the pepper ?
OLD JOE: The pepper is a sort of fog . See my memories start clear here , ut as they go back they get cloudier , until they 're totally obscured . It 's like a fog . Because my memories are n't really memories , they 're one possible eventuality now , and they grow clearer or cloudier as they become more or less likely . But then they get to the present moment And they 're instantly clear again . Like a wall of fog moving forward with the present moment . I can emember what you do after you do it .
JOE: So you can
OLD JOE: And it hurts .
JOE: So when we 're apart you can emember what I do . After I do it .
OLD JOE: Uh huh . But
JOE: Who ?
OLD JOE: She 's gon na save your life .
JOE: She 's . How is she , you said save my life .
OLD JOE: Your life . Let 's look . At you life . You 're a killer and a junkie . And a fucking child mentality , â€œMy life , â€� â€œwhat 's mine.â€� Save your life , you 're asking how ? The question is why . Why would someone waste themselves on you , give up the good life they had , sacrifice a good life to love you .
JOE: My life is my own , I do n't need it
OLD JOE: Shut your fucking child mouth . She 's going to clean you up and you 're going to take her love like a sponge and you 're both going to pretend that she 's saved you , you 're so self absorbed and stupid .
BEAT: Yesterday . Thirty years from now is yesterday . And I can remembe it , it 's going to happen . Let me tell you what 's going to happen to this woman who saved your worthless life .
OLD JOE: Have you heard of the Rainmaker ?
JOE: Seth said , that night . A new boss in the future , he said .
OLD JOE: The Rainmaker came out of nowhere and in the span of six months took total control of the five majo syndicates .
JOE: That would take an army .
OLD JOE: But he did n't have an army . Legend is he did it alone . Alone alone . Do n't know I believe the legend but he did n't have an army .
JOE: How did he do it ?
OLD JOE: That 's the question . And no one knows . Not only that , there 's no pictures of him . It 's insane . There 's stories he has a synthetic jaw . Things like that . But word spread quick about him through the ex-looper grapevine , even before his mass executions and vagrant purges and reign of terror , because the first thing he did was start closing loops . All of them . Exterminating the whole program . Cleaning house .
JOE: None of this concerns me . We 're done we 're gon na walk outside now .
OLD JOE: This is going to happen
JOE: It happened to you , it does n't have to happen to me . You got her picture in there ? Show it to me . Show me her picture . And when I see her for the first time I 'll walk away , and she wo n't e with me .
OLD JOE: Gone .
JOE: She 'll be safe . And then we can all do what we have to do .
OLD JOE: No you do n't understand . We do n't have to give her up . I 'm going to tell you why I 'm here now . He puts his hand on the folded papers .
JOE: It 's been awhile since we 've gotten a warm-up .
OLD JOE: It 's been thirty years for me , so it 's hard to remember . When you stole Seth 's bike you stripped out the security tracker . Right ?
JOE: I 've got him ! He 's here !
OLD JOE: Shit .
JOE: Around back !
KID BLUE: Alive ! No , alive !
JOE: No fuck no fucking piece of shit
KID BLUE: The tracker ! Get the tracker !
JOE: C'mon . C'mere . C'mon . C'mon . C'mon .
ABE: Well . You found him . And you usseled up a posse and went to git â€˜em . Like a good little cowboy from one of your movie movies . Without telling me .
KID BLUE: I can do it again .
ABE: You can fuck up again ? Really . You know what happens to me if I do n't get that old bastard ? I got too much riding , Kid , I ca n't afford a fuck-up playing cowboy . Put your gat on the table .
KID BLUE: I wanted you to say I did good , that 's all I wanted . This is all I have .
SARA: Hey . Who 's there .
SARA: You stop right there , you stop !
BLESS YOUÂ€�: Joe lowers his gun , face melting .
SARA: Jee sus . Hey , hey . I 'm going to get you
TOTALLY GONE: My head splitting apart time eventualities , he said-
SARA: How long since you dropped ?
DROPPED: Sara mimes an eye dropper .
SARA: Dropped , or what the kids call it .
JOE: A day .
SARA: One day . Wow .
JOE: Thirsty . I ca n't feel my legs
SARA: You 're withdrawing from a synthetic arbiturate . It 's a quick punch ut it 's this bad a day in , without care you might not make it through the night .
JOE: Thirsty . Thirsty .
SHARP: Cid . C'mere monkey .
CID: Who 's that man ?
SARA: Just a vagrant babe .
CID: No he 's not .
SARA: Oh yeah ?
CID: His shoes are too shiny .
SARA: Well are n't you a smart monkey .
CID: Is he sick ?
SARA: Yup .

SARA: Go to sleep . Okay . Night baby oy . Kisses him .

SARA: Take it slow and by the end of the week you 'll be at fifty . Good .
JOE: I ca n't do that .
SARA: I 'm sorry ?
JOE: I need to stay here for a little while longer .
SARA: I am not cool with that .
JOE: Well I 'm sorry .
SARA: Well I 'm sorry too , you just lost your take the morning to rest privileges , get off my farm .
JOE: No . Sara raises the shotgun .
SARA: Get off my farm .
JOE: No . You could n't scare a retarded hobo with that thing . Literally .
SARA: This is a Remington 870 , one blast could cut you the fuck in half .
JOE: And that 's , that 's telling . You 're holding a gun . I say I 'm not afraid , so you describe the gun to me . But it 's not the gun I 'm not afraid of .
BEAT: What are you gon na shoot in the air ? Blow a hole in your barn ? To scare me ? Go ahead . But you could n't let me die , you wo n't kill me .
SARA: So now I saved your life that makes me weak ?
JOE: Look I 'm not a threat to you o your boy . I need to be on you property but I 'd prefer to not have any contact with you at all , I 'll stay in the fields . There 's just one thing you need to do for me , and you wo n't have to deal with me again .
SARA: What is this ?
JOE: A map .
SARA: That 's my house . Why is it marked ?
JOE: Does n't matter . Ok . I 'll be out of the barn in an hour , if you can spare it I 'll take the water jug with me . Does that well have water ? I 'll fill it from there .
SARA: What is this .
JOE: Does that mean something to you ?
SARA: Who are you ?
JOE: Time travel has n't been invented yet . But in thirty years it will e .
OLD JOE: Hi . Daniel , right ? I 'm Chad 's father . Are n't you going to come over ? We 're doing cake .

OLD JOE: Well you should join the party even if you do n't have cake . You have a irthday coming up ?
DANIEL: In July . We were gon na go to the lake but I do n't think we are now .
OLD JOE: I 'm sorry .
JOE: I ca n't go back to the city and find him cause Abe , the boss , all his men are going to search the streets 24/7 till they turn up me or him . All I have is this map . And that he 's coming here . Sara stands . Paces away . Deep in thought .
SARA: A Looper .
JOE: Yeah . Did you know about Loopers , what we do
SARA: I 've heard stories . So he 's coming here to murder me and my son ecause he thinks we might be this Rainmaker . And once he kills the Rainmaker , what happens ?
JOE: I think he thinks , the instant the rainmaker dies , he 'll neve have been sent back , so he 'll just vanish , and be back with his wife .
SARA: Who is he ? The guy you let run ? Just some random guy from the future ?
JOE: Yeah . Someone . You know what these numbers mean .
SARA: This is my son Cid 's birthday . And this is the hospital he was born in . Joe 's face , taking this in .
SARA: Would he do this ?
JOE: Think about what doing this would fix . What he thinks it would fix . Sara caught that , and she did not like it .
SARA: If he comes here , can you stop him ? She turns the paper over in her hands .
JOE: I 've lost my life . I kill this man , I get it back . You can trust me .
BEAT: What makes sense is , we burn the fields , level them . Sara realizes he 's seriously asking .
SARA: No you can not burn down my corn fields .
JOE: What kind of equipment 's in the arn ?
SARA: Farm equipment .
JOE: Nothing that shoots .
SARA: No farm equipment that shoots . No .
JOE: Good by me .
SARA: Hold still . Easy for things to get infected on a farm , start falling off .
SOTTO: Pussy .

JESSE: Evenin ma'am .
SARA: Evenin . How can I help you ?
JESSE: You can start by accepting my apologies re the hour , I hope I did n't catch you in supper .
SARA: No , that 's fine .
JESSE: Yours was the last house on my list today , been walking between empty farms all day in the hot sun . Thought I 'd tick this off my list , not have to come back tomorrow .
SARA: What 's this about ?
JESSE: You alone here , ma'am ?
SARA: My husband should be back from the city , any time now .

SARA: This man dangerous ?
JESSE: Tween you me and a lamppost ? No . Sweet kid . But he 's wanted . My oss has half the city 's looking for him . Half the city and me . So . And if you find him , there 's a helluva price . Think on that if he comes by , acting sweet .
SARA: Drafts , in the house .
JESSE: Drafty house .
SARA: Farm house .
JESSE: What 's down there ?
SARA: Laundry room . Door must 've blown open .
JESSE: Two things . First , I have a family of my own back in the city , and I want to see them again . Second if anything happens to me , and I do n't eport back to my boss people in fifteen minutes , they 're gon na know I disappeared searching this house , and inside of another fifteen you 'll have an army of more me 's kicking down your door . Ok ?
SARA: It 's a laundry room . Jesse motions - her first .
JESSE: You want to call out whoever 's hiding in that hamper ?
SARA: If someone was hiding in the house , that 's what I 'd do . But nobody is in the house . Open it up .
JESSE: No I think I 'm gon na put a shot through it just to be safe . He raises his gat . Sara stiffens slightly .
SARA: Now if you promise not to wag you gun at my shoe rack I 'll show you upstairs then show you the fuck out .
CID: My granddad built it , but he did n't tell anyone of us why . Nanna said cuz he was nuts .
JOE: Thank you granddad .
CID: That was n't the man .
JOE: No . I know him , that 's what 's funny . His name 's Jesse . I like him . He 'll go away when he does n't find me , he wo n't hurt her .
CID: But you did n't .
JOE: A man in the city found me , put a gun in my hand , and gave me some things . I did n't have my mom anymore . I had my work , my money . My plans . For my life . That 's what I 'd kill for . Not something I do n't have , and ca n't ever get ack .
BEAT: There 's just men figuring out what they 'd do to keep what 's theirs , what they got . That 's the only kind of man there is .
CID: I 'm not gon na let Sara get killed .
JOE: I think we 're clear . He opens the trap door , climbs out .
KID BLUE: All working girls , yeah ?
SUPER: Uh huh . This whole block . You wan na check those too , I can arrange .
KID BLUE: I do .
SUPER: I 'm an arranger , stranger . Huhuha . But you do n't see what you wan na see , no refunds .
OLD JOE: Anything .
JOE: What ?
SARA: Do n't wake Cid .
LATER: Lying beside each other . Joe still stunned .
JOE: That 's pretty good .
SARA: In the city , young guys would hit on me by floating fucking quarters , I would n't tell â€˜em I was TK but I 'd keep their quarters down . One guy busted a blood vessel in his eye trying to get it up .
BEAT: He 's you . Your loop . You lied to me .
JOE: He 's protecting his future . Not mine . A beat .
SARA: When I came back , after my siste died . Cid was sitting on the porch , I remember seeing him fo the first time , in two years .
BEAT: Maybe I ca n't be a mother to him , is that something I ca n't get back . When he looked at me then , on the porch , he was mine again , he was my son . I seen so many men in the city , who I look in their eyes and they 're lost . Whether he loves me ack or not I 'm gon na love my son I said . And he 's never gon na get lost .
OLD JOE: Do n't . Do n't wake up you daughter .
SUZIE: No . I do n't know you . Who are you ?

EDDISON: Tapert . So , now I 've got Tapert , Butterfield .
HARRY: Tapert 's got nothing to do with this . He came here to get his palm ead .
EDDISON: What makes you so sure ?
HARRY: I got a file on him two inches thick . He 's a petty fraudster . This is something else . Ever heard of someone called the Puritan ?
EDDISON: New one on me . Okay . Let 's see him .

DOROTHEA: Thank you . She dries off .
CLEMENZIA: In his study . He got something on his mind ?
DOROTHEA: Why ?
CLEMENZIA: Bad mood today .
DOROTHEA: Bad show last night ?
SWANN: The usual . Full house . Standing ovation . I tell them it 's magic
DOROTHEA: they believe you .
SWANN: Yeah . Remember Quaid ?
DOROTHEA: Sure .
SWANN: Somebody killed him .
DOROTHEA: Oh God .
SWANN: I just saw him .
DOROTHEA: Sure . You want me to find out about Quaid ? I mean , the funeral ?
SWANN: No . I 'm not going near him .
VALENTIN: Higher . Another inch . The left hand side 's too low .
DOROTHEA: Valentin ?
VALENTIN: Good . There . Yes ?
DOROTHEA: You saw this ?
HARRY: What ?
VALENTIN: We 've never met .
HARRY: Then what do you want ?
VALENTIN: I 'm here to offer you a job .
HARRY: I 'm going back to New York in Shit ! I 'm outta here .
VALENTIN: Have you got a job that 'll pay you five thousand a day ?
HARRY: Do I get lunch ?
VALENTIN: Mine .
HARRY: Nah . You 're driving it too carefully .
VALENTIN: Maybe I just bought it .
HARRY: Somebody 's been smoking in here fo months .
VALENTIN: You could almost pass for a detective , D'Amour . I work for the best illusionist in the world .
HARRY: Philip Swann ?
VALENTIN: You know of him ?
HARRY: I saw him in Vegas once .
VALENTIN: Are you a gambling man ?
HARRY: When I can afford to lose . Swann 's quite a magician .
VALENTIN: Never call him that . He 's strictly an illusionist .
HARRY: What 's the difference ?
VALENTIN: Illusions are trickery . Magicians do it for real .
HARRY: Any movie stars buried here ?
VALENTIN: Probably .
HARRY: It 's not a bad place . Warm . Great view .
VALENTIN: I do n't think the dead much care .
HARRY: Are you sure ?
VALENTIN: Are you a believer , then ? Valentin gives him an inquisitive look .
HARRY: I 've signed on for them all in my time . Hindu . Catholic . You ca n't have too many saviours .
VALENTIN: Swann 's wife .
DOROTHEA: I want you to help me help my husband . I know he 's in some kind of trouble . And it 's something to do with the man you saw murdered .
HARRY: Did your husband know Quaid ?
DOROTHEA: Yes . They were n't close , but they saw each other once in a while . I think Philip believes all that stuff with the tarot cards .
HARRY: You do n't ?
DOROTHEA: I think we make our own futures . Harry makes an approving MURMUR .
HARRY: What 's the connection ?
DOROTHEA: I do n't exactly know . Philip does n't like to talk about the past .
HARRY: Why not ?
DOROTHEA: He 's a secretive man .
HARRY: And you do n't ask questions ?
DOROTHEA: We do n't share our lives the way a lot of people do .
HARRY: Does that mean ?
DOROTHEA: We have n't slept in the same bed for years .
HARRY: But obviously you still care what happens to him .
DOROTHEA: We would n't be having this conversation if I did n't . Swann 's one of the most remarkable men alive . Harry , frowns .
HARRY: He 's an illusionist . It 's not exactly brain surgery . Dorothea stares at him .
DOROTHEA: No . You 're right . He could have een something more . Maybe a lot more . But people get lost . Even good people . Too much fame . Too much money ,
HARRY: Where do I sign ? Dorothea LAUGHS lightly .
DOROTHEA: Will you take the job , Mr. D'Amour ?
HARRY: Harry .
DOROTHEA: Harry .
HARRY: I 'm no bodyguard .
DOROTHEA: That 's not what I 'm asking for . I want somebody who can find out what Philip saw in those damn cards . And stop it from happening .
HARRY: When do you want me to start ?
DOROTHEA: Come to the show with me . Tonight I want you to see him with an audience . They love him .
HARRY: Do you ? The question catches Dorothea off guard .
DOROTHEA: I did n't marry him for love , Mr. D'Amour . Tonight ?
HARRY: Sure .
LOOMIS: The case is closed . Harry . Tapert 's given us a full confession . Get your ass back to Mew York .

HARRY: I got to go . I 'm late .
LOOMIS: Call me tomorrow .
HARRY: There 's other guys as good as me , Loomis .
LOOMIS: Yeah . But not as cheap . Call me .
HARRY: A couple of weeks .
LOOMIS: One question .
HARRY: What ?
LOOMIS: Who is she ? Harry ca n't help but smile to himself .
DOROTHEA: I 'm glad you could make it . Harry takes a seat beside her .
HARRY: Hey , this is a big deal for me . You know what seats like this cost in New York ?
SWANN: Valentin !
VALENTIN: I 'm here .
SWANN: The guy with Dorothea . Is that who I think it is ? Valentin nods . ON SWANN , his expression unreadable .
1ST TECHNICIAN: Ready ?
SWANN: Ready . Swann rises up into the flies .
1ST TECHNICIAN: How the fuck does he do that ?
2ND TECHNICIAN: It 's wires , man .
1ST TECHNICIAN: I never seen no wires .
2ND TECHNICIAN: So what is it ? Magic ?
SWANN: My friends come with meinto the Great Beyond . A barrage of LIGHTS and MUSIC erupt . The AUDIENCE APPLAUDS wildly . ON HARRY and Dorothea .
HARRY: He 's good .
DOROTHEA: You have n't seen anything yet .
HARRY: There 's something wrong
DOROTHEA: No . . .
HARRY: Out of the way ! Out of the way !
VALENTIN: Get then out of here , for God 's sake
STAGE MANAGER: You heard him ! It 's not a fucking show !
MILLER: Psst !
DOROTHEA: Swann A DOCTOR appears .
DOCTOR: I 'm a doctor . Let me through . The Doctor checks Swann 's body .
HARRY: Hey !
MILLER: Got you , fucker !
BUTTERFIELD: Who did this , D'Amour ? Who killed Swann ? Harry is barely holding on to consciousness .
HARRY: You did . Did n't you ?
BUTTERFIELD: Why would I do that ?
HARRY: Beats me . Butterfield is a foot from Harry now .
BUTTERFIELD: You do n't have a clue what you 're into , do you ?
HARRY: Deep shit ? Butterfield hits him .
BUTTERFIELD: Who did this ?
HARRY: I told you Butterfield hits him again .
BUTTERFIELD: Who did this ?
HARRY: All right . It was Butterfield comes a little closer .
BUTTERFIELD: Aah !
HARRY: Deep shit
EDDISON: And this Butterfield guy
HARRY: vanished .
EDDISON: Another fucking magician . Jesus .
HARRY: Are you finished with me ?
EDDISON: For now . Are you planning to go ack to New York ?
HARRY: No . Not yet
DOROTHEA: I heard what happened . It looks like somebody murdered him .
HARRY: I 'm sorry I got into this too late . But if you want me to stick around , maybe dig where the cops do n't look
DOROTHEA: I do n't know where you 'd start .
HARRY: Well how about some of the othe illusionists ?
DOROTHEA: They wo n't tell you anything .
HARRY: I can be very persuasive .
DOROTHEA: Yes . I think you probably can . We 'd need to talk about your fee .
HARRY: Forget the fee . If I find Butterfield , maybe we 'll talk about money . If I do n't my gamble . Either way I get to spend some time here .
WILDER: What ?
HARRY: That .
WILDER: At birth . I do n't know you
HARRY: Harry D'Amour .
WILDER: I know all the kids coming up . Got to stay ahead of the game . But I do n't know you .
HARRY: I 'm in from New York . I came to see Swann .
WILDER: What a tragedy . It was just a matter of time , of course , but it 's not good for the business .
HARRY: Was he taking a lot of risks ?
WILDER: You do n't know the half of it . I 'm Walter Wilder , by the way .
HARRY: Not the Walter Wilder ? Walter beams .
WILDER: The one and only . He hands Harry a card .
HARRY: Sure . Vivovich .
WILDER: He knew Swann way back . He says there were a lot of drugs , a lot of crazy shit .
HARRY: I 'd love to you know hang with some of you guys .
WILDER: People are pretty cagey . Who do you know ?
HARRY: For what ?
WILDER: For an introduction .
HARRY: Well nobody .
WILDER: You do now .
HARRY: I only wear ties for funerals .
WILDER: You do n't get in without one . It 's like a gentlemen 's club fo illusionists . Except most of us are n't gentlemen .
HARRY: Are they all in the business ?
WILDER: It 's not a business . Harry . It 's a vocation . Wilder points to a locked door .
HARRY: Have you been in ?
WILDER: No . There 's only three keys . Vinovich has got one , of course . He 's a little crazy , by the way . And he 's a mean drunk . Otherwise , he 's a real charmer .
VINOVICH: It 's more than entertainment . We 're opening people 's heads up . Putting miracles back into their boring little lives .
BILLY: But they 're fake miracles .
VINOVICH: Houdini believed he had spirit guides .
HARRY: You believe that ?
VINOVICH: I think we walk a narrow path , etween between
HARRY: Heaven and Hell ?
VINOVICH: Trickery and divinity .
HARRY: Are you saying that sometimes the miracles are real ?
VINOVICH: No . I 'm saying they were always fake . The saints , the messiahs , they were just illusionists .
HARRY: So could you walk on water ?
VINOVICH: I could reproduce any miracle that 's ever been performed , with a little preparation .
HARRY: What about Swann 's miracles ?
VINOVICH: They were n't worth a damn .
HARRY: I heard he was the best .
VINOVICH: If he was so good why 's he so dead ? Vinovich begins to look suspicious .
HARRY: You tell me . No ? I thought you 'd maybe have a theory .
VINOVICH: Oh , I 've got plenty .
HARRY: I 'd like to hear them . Vinovich rises .
VINOVICH: I 'm not saying another word . You damn fool . He 's a journalist .
HARRY: Just tell me about Swann . Or are you too scared ?
VINOVICH: He was a freak . Everything he did was tainted .
HARRY: With what ?
VINOVICH: Evil . He was evil . Come on . She rises .
HARRY: Great accent , by the way . Is it Brooklyn ?
VINOVICH: Fuck you .
BILLY: I got ta be careful . If Vinovich sees me talking to you . He 's an asshole , but he 's a powerful asshole .
HARRY: They go together .
BILLY: I 've heard a name . Someone they talk about in whispers .
HARRY: Who ?
BILLY: Nix .
HARRY: Nix ?
BILLY: Like in nothing . Nobody . Nix .
HARRY: Who is he ?
BILLY: I think maybe he taught Swann . This is me . See ya around . Billy hurries away .
BUTTERFIELD: Ever watched a man die ?
QUAID: Please I was n't there Ask Pimm .
BUTTERFIELD: Pimm 's dead . Jennifer Desiderio 's disappeared
QUAID: I 'm not afraid to die . There 's something terrible coming home A long silence . SUDDENLY , a telephone RINGS .
HARRY: Shit ! He picks up the receiver .
DOROTHEA: Harry I know it 's late .
HARRY: That 's okay .
DOROTHEA: How did it go today ?
HARRY: I went up to the Magic Castle . You were right . He did n't have a lot of fans up there .
DOROTHEA: He did n't have me.. I told you-
HARRY: You did n't marry him for love .
HARRY: So why did you marry him ?
DOROTHEA: That 's my business . Harry .
HARRY: Just curious . Back to business . Ever heard of a man called Nix ? Dorothea ?
DOROTHEA: Yes I 'm here . And no . I do n't know the name .
HARRY: What about Jennifer Desiderio ?
DOROTHEA: It does n't ring a bell . I have to go .
HARRY: Okay . I 'll keep digging .
DOROTHEA: Yes . You do that .
HARRY: Yes
VALENTIN: Looking for you . I tried the hotel .
HARRY: Why 'd you come here ?
VALENTIN: You 're a detective , with no clues . Where else are you going to look ? I 'm going to keep this brief . Here 's thirty thousand dollars .
HARRY: What for ?
VALENTIN: A ticket home ,
HARRY: You did n't hire me . She did . If she wants me off the job , I want to hear it from her .
VALENTIN: She does n't want to see you . She 's had enough pain . Enough churning over the past . She wants it all left alone .
HARRY: Left alone ? Somebody 's been murdered .
VALENTIN: Yes . It 's regrettable
HARRY: Fuck regrettable ! I want to know why .
VALENTIN: What for ? You need to stay busy ?
HARRY: I like to know why things happen .
VALENTIN: Why people die ? Give it up , D'Amour . Go home .
HARRY: No .
VALENTIN: Do n't try and see her , D'Amour . Just leave her alone . Let he heal . He glances back at Valentin .
HARRY: Lock up , will you ?
TOFFLER: Jennifer 's only ever had one visitor .
HARRY: A Mister Quaid ?
TOFFLER: Right . And he 's dead , is n't he ? I saw it on the news . Jennife does n't know . And frankly , this is n't the best tine for her to be told .
HARRY: I wo n't say anything .
TOFFLER: Jennifer 's been with us four years . She was coming on nicely . But just the last month or so , she 's worse than ever .
HARRY: What 's her problem ?
TOFFLER: She has no real grip on reality .
HARRY: Does anybody ?
TOFFLER: Oh yes . We have to agree what 's eal and what 's not . That 's what holds us together .
HARRY: And what does Jennifer think 's eal ?
TOFFLER: Jennifer thinks the Devil 's coming for her . Jennifer ? Jennifer turns . She looks terrible .
JENNIFER: Have we met before ?
HARRY: No .
JENNIFER: Only I forget . They give me pills , you know , to keep me even and I forget things ,
HARRY: Well , you did n't forget me . I just came because I wanted to know if you knew a man called Butterfield .
JENNIFER: Maybe I do n't
HARRY: What about Philip Swann ?
JENNIFER: I knew Swann . He 's a fucking liar . A WORKMAN saunters past , carrying pipes .
HARRY: Why 's that ?
JENNIFER: He said he knew how to protect us . But he did n't know anything . He made us think it was over and done with .
HARRY: What is ?
JENNIFER: I do n't want to think about it . If I think about it he 'll hear me . He 'll find me .
HARRY: Swann ?
JENNIFER: I told you . I do n't
NURSE: Calm down !
JENNIFER: He 's not going to get me !
HARRY: Who 's not ? He catches up with her .
JENNIFER: Nix ! Nix !
HARRY: Is he the Puritan ?
JENNIFER: Yes ! Yes !
HARRY: And he 's dead ?
JENNIFER: No . He 's coming back . He 's digging his way out ! The Nurse appears behind Harry .
NURSE: I 'll take care of her now . Jennifer struggles in Harry 's grip .
HARRY: Jennifer !
DOROTHEA: Who is it ? Valentin puts the phone down .
VALENTIN: Crank call . I 'll get the numbe changed .
DOROTHEA: No word from D'Amour ? Valentin shakes his head .
VALENTIN: It 's better he 's gone . He would have done more harm than good .
DOROTHEA: Harm to whom ? Me ? I do n't think , so . Try him again at the hotel .
VALENTIN: I left three messages already .
HARRY: Billy ? It 's Harry . Suppose I wanted to get into the repository at the Magic Castle ?
BILLY: I 've had my moments .
HARRY: How ?
BILLY: It 'll be something hokey . CLICK ! The door opens .
HARRY: You heard right .
BILLY: You ever been married ?
HARRY: Yeah . She was killed in a ca crash . Her lawyer was driving . She was filing for divorce .
BILLY: Why ?
HARRY: My life was too weird for her .
BILLY: I love weird .
HARRY: Billy ? This was on Miller 's forehead . Any idea what it is ?
BILLY: Nope .
HARRY: What have we got here ?
BILLY: Jesus ! He slams the files down . He 's trembling .
HARRY: That would have kept you out of the Magic Circle . Which was presumably the idea . These are about Nix .
BILLY: doorway ) And who 's that ? ON HARRY , staring at the ambiguous presence . ON THE PHOTOGRAPH of the shadowy figure .
HARRY: At a guess ? The Puritan . Nix .
BILLY: Take a look at this .
HARRY: A Nix specialty ?
BILLY: I do n't know any of these tricks Harry studies the etchings .
HARRY: Maybe they 're not tricks .
BILLY: I mean , there 's no instructions What do you mean , they 're not tricks ?
HARRY: What did Vinovich say ? Something about walking a path between
BILLY: Trickery and divinity . Yeah , he says that all the time .
HARRY: That 's because he knew . He 'd seen these files and knew .
BILLY: Knew what ?
HARRY: Okay . Hold it right there .
BILLY: Get it off me !
HARRY: Hokey enough for you ?
BILLY: I 'm out of here , man ! Are you coming ?
HARRY: I 'm coming .
BILLY: Hey , anytime . Actually , no . This was enough . They shake , and part .
VALENTIN: I ca n't let you in .
HARRY: Yeah , I know .
VALENTIN: You want more money , is that it ? Harry pushes him aside .
HARRY: Dorothea ?
VALENTIN: Leave her alone
HARRY: Shut up ! He pushes open the door .
DOROTHEA: This is the way he wanted it no autopsy , no embalming . Nobody meddling with his body Harry approaches , slowly .
HARRY: I did n't leave . I was just digging around . Dorothea looks up at him .
DOROTHEA: What did you find ?
HARRY: Jennifer Desiderio , for one . She threw herself in front of a ca this afternoon . Dorothea ca n't disguise her distress .
DOROTHEA: Oh Christ .
HARRY: Why do n't you tell me the truth ?
DOROTHEA: It was more than that , I think .
HARRY: He was the real thing , right ?
DOROTHEA: Swann said he could do stuff , yes .
HARRY: Stuff ?
DOROTHEA: He could get into people 's heads . Make them see things . Terrible things . And he could levitate . Juggle fire .
HARRY: He taught all this to Swann ?
DOROTHEA: Some or it .
HARRY: So Swann was performing magic . not illusions ? And what ? You thought he should be using it to cure cancer , not making millions .
DOROTHEA: I told you
HARRY: Too much fame . Yeah , I guess that 'd turn anybody 's head . Including yours .
DOROTHEA: No .
HARRY: You said you were n't with him fo love .
DOROTHEA: I was n't .
HARRY: What then ?
DOROTHEA: I was grateful to him . I owed him my life . And he loved me . He could n't always show it , but he felt it .
HARRY: He thought Nix was coming back , did n't he ?
DOROTHEA: Shit ! They are very close to each other .
HARRY: It 's okay .
DOROTHEA: No it is n't . You ca n't help me .
HARRY: I 'm here , are n't I ? He kisses her . She kisses him back , hard .
DOROTHEA: Nothing ?
HARRY: Nothing you do n't want . They kiss again , passionately .
DOROTHEA: I was so afraid .
HARRY: Do n't be . Nix ca n't hurt you now .
DOROTHEA: Are you sure ?
HARRY: I 'm sure . He 's dead .
DOROTHEA: I know . I 'm the one who shot him . ON HARRY . He 's startled , to say the least .
HARRY: And they all came
DOROTHEA: Yes .
HARRY: Quaid and Jennifer
DOROTHEA: And Pimm and Swann . Only Nix was eady for them . There 's a NOISE downstairs .
HARRY: It 's okay . Harry slips out of bed .
DOROTHEA: Harry ? Wait !
HARRY: What the hell- ?
DOROTHEA: It 's him ! It 's Nix ! Harry goes out into the passageway .
HARRY: Valentin ! Get some lights on !
DOROTHEA: Oh my God !
HARRY: Which goes first ? My face o your heart ?
DOROTHEA: Who in God 's name are you ?
HARRY: Find Valentin ! Find him ! Get him in here !
VALENTIN: What are you doing ? This is sacrilege .
HARRY: No .
DOROTHEA: Harry ?
HARRY: It 's all right . It 's not hurting
VALENTIN: Yes .
HARRY: You paid off the doctor . You set up the fake body . Yes ?
VALENTIN: Yes .
HARRY: And then because I was getting too close to something or someone , you called Swann
VALENTIN: I tried to pay you off .
HARRY: Was that Swann 's idea ?
VALENTIN: No . It was mine . I did n't want any more bloodshed . That 's why we went to all this trouble , so there 'd be no one for Nix to come after .
HARRY: Nix is dead and buried , fo fuck 's sake .
VALENTIN: Have n't you seen enough to know that does n't matter ?
HARRY: I want to see Swann face to face .
VALENTIN: Why do n't you leave this alone ? Let everybody think it 's over ?
DOROTHEA: What about me ?
VALENTIN: Nix was never interested in you . It was always Swann . A beat .
HARRY: Maybe Valentin 's right . We should let it alone . A BELL starts to TOLL-
1ST WORKER: Watch out !
VALENTIN: Who 's there ?
BUTTERFIELD: I 've sometimes thought , if I 'd had another profession , I would have een a surgeon . On Valentin , staring up in terror .
VALEMTIN: No . . .
BUTTERFIELD: Let 's say those eyes of yours were giving you trouble .
VALENTIN: Please .
BUTTERFIELD: I could scoop them out .
VALENTIN: Do n't .
BUTTERFIELD: So tell me where Nix is buried .
VALENTIN: I do n't know .
BUTTERFIELD: You 'll do more.than that .
HARRY: I knew you would n't be able tn stay away .
SWANN: You should n't have followed me , D'Amour .
HARRY: How the fuck do you do that ?
SWANN: Now I 'm going to have to kill you .
HARRY: I do n't think so . You need me alive .
SWANN: Why ? So you can fuck my wife ?
HARRY: Be careful . Funerals make me trigger-happy . Swann stops , inches from the ground .
SWANN: Illusionists get . Las Vegas contracts , D'Amour . Magicians get urned .
HARRY: Or murdered , like Nix .
SWANN: He deserved it .
HARRY: Maybe he does n't see it that way . Maybe he 's digging his way out of the hole you put him ight now . That 's what you 're hiding away from , is n't it ?
SWANN: I did it for Dorothea .
HARRY: Oh yeah ?
SWANN: Now that I 'm dead , the spotlight 's off her .
HARRY: So Nix wo n't come looking for her ?
SWANN: It 's me betrayed him .
HARRY: And she shot him I I think that 'd piss me off if I were Nix .
SWANN: I do n't know what else to do .
HARRY: Help me .
SWANN: Is this the best brandy you 've got ?
CASHIER: If that 's what 's on the shelves .
SWANN: Can you change a thousand for me ?
CASHIER: You 're shittin ' me .
HARRY: Can we go ?
SWANN: Will that do ? No ?
DOROTHEA: Who 's there ?
VALENTIN: I 'm sorry . BLOOD runs from his cut face .
DOROTHEA: Jesus . Valentin . What did you do to your face ?
BUTTERFIELD: Guess who we 're going to see ?
SWANN: You think I 'm an asshole .
HARRY: Did n't know you read minds .
SWANN: I can do a lot of shit , D'Amour . But you know that . So I like playing games with people . Gives them something to wonder about
HARRY: Is that all ?
SWANN: I distract them from their banality for a few minutes . It 's like a public service . It does n't mean much in the end . They 're all going to die .
HARRY: And you 're not ? Silence for a moment .
SWANN: Oh , I was going to discover the secret of the universe . That 's why I liked Nix . He promised me all these explanations .
HARRY: And he did n't have them ?
SWANN: He had something . He showed me how to bend the rules . A little levitation . A few fireworks .
HARRY: Is that all ?
SWANN: No . At the end when we had him cornered , he got into my head . He showed me what we really look like , when the veneer 's gone . Jelly . Shit
HARRY: And you believed him ?
SWANN: I saw it with my own fucking eyes ! See , that 's his best trick . No illusions . Just the truth . Are you ready for that ? Harry grabs the brandy bottle from Swann .
HARRY: Dorothea ? Now he 's on the landing . Swann 's below .
SWANN: She 's not here . Harry spots Valentin 's BLOOD on the carpet .
HARRY: Did she know where Nix was buried ?
SWANN: No .
HARRY: Who else did ? Did Valentin ?
SWANN: Yes .
HARRY: Jesus !
BUTTERFIELD: Like the look of these ? I made them myself , to set him free .
DOROTHEA: Why did you wait so long ?
BUTTERFIELD: I did n't have the skill to esurrect him . I had to teach myself . And that took time .
DOROTHEA: And you think he 'll be in a fit state to resurrect , after thirteen years ?
BUTTERFIELD: If he was just a man like me , then no . But he 's not .
DOROTHEA: What is he ?
BUTTERFIELD: Maybe he 'll show you . ON DOROTHEA , terror in her eyes .
NORMAN: He will come ! He will come ! He will come !
BUTTERFIELD: Anything ?
VALENTIN: I swear this is the place Swann told me about . The rocks
BUTTERFIELD: Five more minutes . Hear me ? And you 'd better not
VALENTIN: In the corner The beam goes to the corner of the grave .
BUTTERFIELD: Keep away from it .
VALENTIN: Oh Christ ! Oh Christ !
BUTTERFIELD: It 's him it 's him . On Dorothea , sliding down the car in despair .
HARRY: They got here before us .
SWANN: Looks that way .
HARRY: Shit !
VALENTIN: D'Amour
HARRY: Shit
VALENTIN: Help me . He collapses into Harry 's arms .
HARRY: Swann !
VALENTIM: He 's got Dorothea .
SWANN: And Nix ?
VALENTIN: Him too .
HARRY: We 've got to get you to a hospital .
VALENTIN: Do n't bother .
HARRY: Shut up . We 've lost enough lives already .
VALENTIN: I 'm sorry , D'Amour
HARRY: What about ?
VALENTIN: Looks like you 're going to lose one more . Valentin dies .
HARRY: no
SWANN: He 's better off this way .
HARRY: Nobody 's better off this wav !
SWANN: You do n't get it , do you ? We 're shit . D'Amour .
HARRY: In my time , and nobody else 's .
BUTTERFIELD: Do you wish him to be amongst us ?
CULTISTS: Yes
BUTTERFIELD: Will you come to him on you knees ?
CULTISTS: Yes
BUTTERFIELD: Be ready .
DOROTHEA: Listen . You 've got everything you want . You do n't need me . ..
BUTTERFIELD: No , but he will . After what you did to him .
CULTISTS: He 's coming home he/s coming home
DOROTHEA: Christ in Heaven .
BUTTERFIELD: He 's with us
CULTISTS: He 's with us He 's with us
DOROTHEA: Oh God ! Butterfield looks up .
BUTTERFIELD: Hold her !
NIX: Aaarrrgh !
HARRY: Jesus what the hell 's going on in there ?
SWANN: At a guess they just resurrected him .
HARRY: Fuck .
NIX: Children
CULTISTS: Yes yes
NIX: Follow me then .
DOROTHEA: I do n't know where he is .
NIX: He 'll come . We 've got unfinished usiness , he and I .
CULTISTS: Tell us tell us
SWANN: This is where we killed him .
HARRY: You did n't try hard enough .
SWANN: I ca n't I ca n't go any further
NIX: Here is my wisdom .
BARBARA: Show us . Puritan .
NORMAN: Yes , show us !
ALL: Show us ! Show us !
SWANN: Whatever he 's doing to her , stop him ! And Harry 's up and away
NIX: You see , I escaped the grave . So I have to give something to the grave in return .
NORMAN: What 's happening ?
NIX: I have to give something back . So I 'm giving you .
BARBARA: Why ? Why ?
NIX: You 're not worthy . None of you . Only Swann was worthy . You just waited like lambs .
SWANN: Aah !
BUTTERFIELD: Go on , bleed . Go on ! Go on !
NIX: You 're not Swann . Who are you ? ) Oh I know what you want . He lets Dorothea slip from his arms .
DOROTHEA: Oh God !
HARRY: Hang on !
NIX: There you are .
SWANN: And ?
NIX: I should have been honest with you , ight from the start . I was n't orn to show people the error of their ways . I was born to murde the world .
SWANN: Why would I want to ?
NIX: Because you 've got nothing else to live for .
SWANN: Not true .
NIX: The woman has a new love in he life . Your friends are dead . Nobody 's left to save you , but me
HARRY: I 've got to help him .
DOROTHEA: You ca n't .
HARRY: Nix has got to have a weak spot . Everybody 's got a fucking weak spot . A NOISE . He turns , and suddenly
BUTTERFIELD: Bastard !
NIX: Will you help me ? A beat . Then Swann nods .
SWANN: Yes . Nix lets him go .
NIX: You know I 'll kill you when we 're done . I have to .
SWANN: Yes .
NIX: But until then it 's you and me the way it always was .
SWANN: Yes .
NIX: Wait you still feel something for that bitch ?
SWANN: No !
NIX: Liar !
SWANN: Harry !
NIX: Where did she go ?
HARRY: Oh God !
NIX: Tell me where she is and I 'll make it go away
HARRY: Oh God oh God
WOMAN: Help me .
HARRY: Dorothea !
HARRY: No ! No ! No !
DOROTHEA: It 's not real , Harry- Harry turns around . Dorothea is there .
HARRY: oh God
DOROTHEA: I 'm here , Harry .
HARRY: yes ?
DOROTHEA: Yes .
NIX: There you are , child . Harry starts to look round .
DOROTHEA: Do n't look .
HARRY: I have to .
NIX: Come on , child . I want Swann to see you die . Harry turns and looks at Nix .
HARRY: There there ! ON NIX , as he looks up at Dorothea .
DOROTHEA: Harry ?
HARRY: I 'm okay . I 'm okay . Harry opens his eyes . Looks up at her .
NIX: One last illusion
DOROTHEA: Oh my God . Harry and Dorothea start to get up
NIX: I am the purest of the pure . I am the darkest of the dark
SWANN: Harry . You ca n't kill him . Harry crouches beside Swann .
HARRY: He did something with the ground .
SWANN: Yes ?
HARRY: Can you do it ?
SWANN: I do n't know .
HARRY: Try .
NIX: No ! No ! No ! He 's at the edge of the pit .
DOROTHEA: Is it finished ?
HARRY: I think so .
DOROTHEA: Come on
HARRY: What the fuck ?
DOROTHEA: Harry- ?
HARRY: Out ! Out ! They race for the front door
GALADRIEL: One by one the Free lands of Middle earth fell to the power of the ring .
GALADRIEL: Victory was near !
GOLLUM: It came to me . My own . My love My preciousness .
GALADRIEL: It was picked up by the most unlikely creature imaginable
BILBO: What 's this ?
FRODO: You 're late .
GANDALF: A Wizard is never late , Frodo Baggins , nor is he early . He arrives precisely when he means to .
FRODO: It 's wonderful to see you , Gandalf !
GANDALF: You did n't think I 'd miss your Uncle Bilbo 's birthday ?
FRODO: What news of the outside world ? Tell me everything !
GANDALF: What , everything ? Far too eager and curious for a Hobbit . Most unnatural
FRODO: You know Bilbohe 's got he whole place in an uproar .
GANDALF: Oh , wellthat should please him .
FRODO: Half the Shire 's been invited
GANDALF: Good gracious , me .
FRODO: He 's up to something .
GANDALF: Oh , really ?
FRODO: Alright then..keep your secrets . Before you came along we Bagginses were very well thought of .
GANDALF: Indeed ?
FRODO: Never had any adventures or did anything unexpected .
GANDALF: If you 're referring to the incident with the DragonI was barely involvedall I did was give your Uncle a little nudge out the door .
FRODO: Whatever you didyou 've been officially labelled as a Disturber of the Peace .
GANDALF: Oh , really ?
FRODO: Gandalf I 'm glad you 're back . Frodo leaps expertly from the cart . Gandalf smiles .
GANDALF: So am I , dear boyso am I
BILBO: Gandalf ?
GANDALF: Bilbo Baggins !
BILBO: My dear Gandalf !
GANDALF: It 's good to see you . One hundred and eleven years old , who would believe it ! Gandalf looks at him more keenly .
BILBO: Come on , come in ! Welcome , welcome ! !
GANDALF: Just tea , thank you .
BILBO: Oh..right . You do n't mind if ?
GANDALF: No , not at all . Go ahead . A sudden loud knock on the front door .
BILBO: I 'm not home .
GANDALF: So , you mean to go through with you plan , then ?
BILBO: Yes , yesit 's all inhand . All the arrangements are made .
GANDALF: Frodo suspects something .
BILBO: 'Course he does , he 's a Bagginsnot some block headed Bracegirdle from Hardbottle !
GANDALF: You will tell him , wo n't you ?
BILBO: Yes , yes .
GANDALF: He 's very fond of you .
BILBO: I know . He 'd probably come with me if I asked him . I think , in his heart , Frodo 's still in love with the Shire , the woods and the fields little rivers . Bilbo stands gazing out of the kitchen window .
FRODO: Go on , Sam , ask Rosie for a dance .
SAM: I think I 'll just have myself anothe ale .
FRODO: Oh , no you do n't . Go on .
BILBO: So , there I wasat the mercy of three monstrous trollsHave you ever heard of a troll ? Do you know what a Troll is ? Great big nasty twenty foot high smelly things..and they 're arguingarguing about how they were going to cook us !
MERRY: No , no..the big onethe big one ! Pippin grabs a huge rocket . CLOSE ON FIREWORK FUSE crackles with flame !
PIPPIN: It is in the ground .
MERRY: Outside !
PIPPIN: It was your idea .
FRODO: Bilbo ! Watch out for the dragon ! !
BILBO: Dragon ? Nonsensehasn1t been a dragon in these parts for a thousand years !
MERRY: That was good !
PIPPIN: Let 's get another one !
GANDALF: Meridoc Brandybuck and Peregrin TookI might have known !
FRODO: Speech !
BILBO: My dear Bagginses , and Boffins , tooks and BrandybucksGrubbs , Chubbs , Hornblowers , Bolgers , Bracegirdles and Proudfoots
ODO PROUDFOOT: Proudfeet !
BILBO: Today is my one hundred and eleventh irthday . Yes , and alasEleventy- one years is far too short a time to live among such excellent and admirable Hobbits ! Tremendous outburst of approval !
GANDALF: I suppose you think that was terribly clever ?
BILBO: Come on , Gandalf ! Did you see thei faces ?
GANDALF: There are many magic rings in the world , Bilbo Baggins , and none of them should be used lightly .
BILBO: It was just a bit of fun . Oh , you 're probably right as usual .
GANDALF: You will keep an eye on Frodo , wo n't you ?
BILBO: I 'm leaving everything to him .
GANDALF: What about this ring of yours ? Is that staying too ?
BILBO: Yes , yes , it 's in an envelopeove there on the mantelpiece . Gandalf frowns at the empty mantelpieceBilbo suddenly feels his waistcoat with a look of guilty surprise .
GANDALF: I think you should leave the Ring behind , Bilbo . Is that so hard ?
BILBO: Well , noand yes . Now it comes to it , I do n't feel like parting with it . It 's mine . I found it . It came to me !
GANDALF: There 's no need to get angry .
BILBO: Well , if I 'm angry , it 's your fault ! It 's mine . My own , my precious .
GANDALF: Precious ? It 's been called that before , ut not by you .
BILBO: So ? What business is it of yours what I do with my own things ? Bilbo 's voice , shape and manner have suddenly changed .
GANDALF: I think you 've had that ring quite long enough .
BILBO: You want it for yourself !
GANDALF: Bilbo Baggins do not take me for some conjurer of cheap tricks ! Bilbo cowers from Gandalf , disarmed by his powera frightened Hobbit . Gandalf 's expression softens .
BILBO: You 're right , Gandalfthe ring must go to Frodo .
GANDALF: Bilbo ?
BILBO: Hmmm ?
GANDALF: The ring is still in your pocket . Bilbo hesitatesreaches into his pocket .
BILBO: Oh , yes .
GANDALF: I 'm sure you will , my dear friend .
BILBO: Goodbye , Gandalf .
GANDALF: Goodbye Bilbo .
GANDALF: Riddles in the dark .
FRODO: He 's gone , has n't he ? Frodo steps into the living room .
GANDALF: my own .
FRODO: Gandalf ?
GANDALF: Bilbo 's ring .
FRODO: Where are you going ?
GANDALF: I have some things I must see to .
FRODO: What things ?
GANDALF: Questions . Questions that need answering .
FRODO: You 've only just arrived ! I do n't understand
GANDALF: Neither do I . Keep it secret , keep it safe .
GANDALF: The year 3434 of the Second Agehere follows the account of Isildur , High King of Gondor , and the finding of the ring of power .
GANDALF: The marking upon the band begin to fadethe writing which at first was as clear as red flame , has all but disappeareda secret now that only fire can tell
BLACK RIDER: Shire ? Baggins ?
FARMER MAGGOT: There 's no Bagginses around here ! They are all up in Hobbitonthat way . The BLACK RIDER GALLOPS AWAY AT SPEED
GANDALF: Is it secret ? Is it safe ?
FRODO: What are you doing ?
GANDALF: Hold out your hand , Frodoit is quite cool .
FRODO: Nothingthere 's nothing . Wait
GANDALF: these are markings .
FRO DO: It 's some form of ElvishI ca n't read it .
GANDALF: There are few who canthe language is that of Mordor , which I will not utte here . Mordor ?
FRODO: GANDALF
GANDALF: This is the one ring forged by the dark lord , Sauron , in the fires of Mt Doomtaken by Isildur from the hand of Sauron himself .
FRODO: Bilbo found itin Gollom 's cave .
GANDALF: For sixty years the ring lay quiet in Bilbo 's keeping , prolonging his life , delaying old agebut no longer , Frodo . Evil is stirring in Mordor . The ring has awoken . It has heard its master 's call .
FRODO: But he was destroyedSauron was destroyed .
GANDALF: No , Frodo . The spirit of Sauron has endured . His life force is bound to the ing and the ring survived . Sauron has eturned . His Orcs have multipliedhis fortress of Barad- dur is rebuilt in the land of Mordor . Sauron needs only this ing to cover all the lands in the second darkness . He is seeking it , seeking it , all his thought is bent on it . For the ing yearns , above all else , to return to the hand of its master they are one , the ing and the dark lord . Frodo , he must never find out . SUDDENLY Frodo scoops up the Ring .
FRODO: Alright !
GANDALF: There is one other who knew that Bilbo had the Ring . I looked everywhere fo the creature Gollum , but the enemy found him first .
GOLLUM: SShire ! Baggins !
FRODO: Shire ! Baggins ! That will lead them here !
HOBBIT BOUNDER: Halt ! Who goes there ?
FRODO: Take it ! Take it !
GANDALF: No , Frodo
FRODO: You must take it .
GANDALF: You can not offer me this ring .
FRODO: I 'm giving it to you !
GANDALF: Do n't tempt me , Frodo . I dare not take it , not even to keep it safe .
FRODO: But it can not stay in the Shire !
GANDALF: No , no it ca n't .
FRODO: What must I do ?
GANDALF: You must leave , and leave quickly . Get out of the Shire .
FRODO: Where ? Where shall I go ?
GANDALF: Make for the village of Bree .
FRODO: Bree ? What about you ?
GANDALF: I will , be waiting for you at the Inn of the Prancing Pony . Frodo packs his food into his knapsack .
FRODO: And the ring will be safe there ?
GANDALF: I do n't know , Frodo . I do n't have any answers . I must see the Head of my Order . He is both wise and powerful . Trust me , Frodo . He 'll know what to go .
FRODO: I can cut across country easily enough .
GANDALF: My dear Frodo , Hobbits really are amazing creatures . You can learn all that there is to know about their ways in a month , and yet , after a hundred years , they can still surprise you . SUDDENLY ! A SOUND from outside .
SAM: I ai n't been dropping no eaves , sir ! Honest . I was just cutting the grass under the window there , if you follow me
GANDALF: It 's a little late for trimming the hedges , do n't you think ?
SAM: I heard raised voices
GANDALF: What did you hear ? Speak !
SAM: Nothing importantthat is , I heard a good deal about a ringand a Dark Lord . And something about the end of the world , utPlease , Mr. Gandalf , sir , do n't hurt me ! Do n't turn me into anything unnatural !
GANDALF: No ?
GANDALF: Perhaps not . I 've thought of a bette use for you .
SAM: This is it .
FRODO: This is what ?
SAM: If I take one more step it 'll be the farthest away from home I 've ever been . FRODO gives Sam a pat on the shoulder .
FRODO: Come on , Sam .
SARUMAN: For that is why you have come , is it not , my old friend ?
GANDALF: Saruman !
SARUMAN: Are you sure of this ?
GANDALF: Beyond any doubt .
SARUMAN: So the ring of power has been found ?
GANDALF: All these long years it was in the Shire , under my very nose .
SARUMAN: And yet you did not have the wit to see it ! Your love of the Halfling 's leaf has clearly slowed your mind .
GANDALF: We still have timetime enough to counter Sauronif we act quickly .
SARUMAN: Time ? What time do you think we have ?
SARUMAN: Sauron has regained much of his forme strength . He can not yet take physical formbut his spirit has lost none of its potency . Concealed within his fortress , the lord of Mordor sees all . His gaze pierces cloud , shadow , earth , and flesh . You know of what I speak , Gandalfa great Eye , lidless , wreathed in flame .
GANDALF: The eye of Sauron .
SARUMAN: He is gathering all evil to him .
GANDALF: You know this ? How ?
SARUMAN: I have seen it .
GANDALF: A palantir is a dangerous tool , Saruman .
SARUMAN: Why ? Why should we fear to use it ?
GANDALF: They are not all accounted for , the lost seeing-stoneswe do not know who else may be watching . Gandalf throws the cloth ack over the Palantir .
SARUMAN: The hour is later than you think . Sauron 's forces are already movingthe Nine have left Minas Morgul .
GANDALF: The nine !
SARUMAN: They crossed the river Isen in Midsummer 's eve , disguised as riders in lack .
GANDALF: They have reached the Shire ? Saruman shrugs
SARUMAN: They will find the ringand kill the one who carries it .
GANDALF: Tell me , friend , when did Saruman the wise abandon reason for madness ?
SARUMAN: I gave you the chance of aiding me willingly , but you have elected the way of pain .
SAM: Mr. Frodo . Mr. Frodo ! Frodo turns , surprised as Sam comes running towards him .
FRODO: What are you talking about ?
SAM: It 's just something Gandalf said
FRODO: What did he say ?
SAM: He said '' Do n't you leave him , Samwise Gamgee . '' And I do n't mean to .
FRODO: Samwe 're still in the Shirewhat could possibly happen ?
PIPPIN: Frodo ! Merry , it 's Frodo Baggins .
MERRY: Hello Frodo
SAM: What 's the meaning of this !
MERRY: Sam , hold this Merry gives Sam a large cabbage .
SAM: You 've been into Farmer Maggot 's crop !
MERRY: I do n't know why he 's so upset , it 's only a couple of carrots .
PIPPIN: And some cabbagesand those three bags of potatoes that we lifted last week . And then the mushrooms the week before .
MERRY: Yes , Pippin , my point is , he 's clearly over reacting . The BAYING OF LARGE DOGS sounds !
PIPPIN: Run !
MERRY: OwI think I 've broken something .
SAM: Trust a Brandybuck and a Took .
MERRY: What ? That was just a detoura shortcut .
SAM: A shortcut to what ?
PIPPIN: Mushrooms !
FRODO: I think we should get off the road .
SAM: Frodo ?
MERRY: What was that ?
SAM: Anything ?
FRODO: Nothing .
PIPPIN: What is going on ?
MERRY: The Black rider was looking fo somethingor someoneFrodo ?
SAM: Get down !
FRODO: I have to leave the ShireSam and I must get to Bree .
MERRY: RightBuckleberry Ferryfollow me !
MERRY: Get the ropes , Sam .
SAM: Frodo !
FRODO: How far to the nearest crossing ?
MERRY: The brandwine bridgetwenty miles .
FRODO: Come on . A SURLY GATEKEEPER glances down at them .
GATEKEEPER: What do you want ?
FRODO: We 're headed for the prancing pony .
GATEKEEPER: Hobbits ! Four Hobbits , and what 's more , out of the Shire by your talk . What usiness brings you to Bree ?
FRODO: We wish to stay at the innour business is our own . To Frodo 's relief , the Gatekeeper unlocks the gate .
GATEKEEPER: All right , young sir , I meant no offense .
FRODO: Excuse me .
BUTTERBUR: Good evening , little masters . If you 're seeking accommodation , we 've got some nice , cozy Hobbit sized rooms available , Mrah
FRODO: Underhillmy name 's Underbill .

PIPPIN: It comes in pints ? I 'm getting one !
SAM: You 've had a whole half already . Merry watches Pippin go .
FRODO: Excuse me , that man in the corner , who is he ?
BUTTERBUR: He 's one of them Rangers ; they 're dangerous folk they are , wandering the wilds . What his right name is , I neve heard , but round here he 's known as Strider .
FRODO: Strider .
PIPPIN: Baggins ? Sure , I know a Bagginshe 's over there
FRODO: Pippin !
PIPPIN: Steady on , Frodo !
STRIDER: You draw far too much attention to yourselfMr . Underhill
FRODO: What do you want ?
STRIDER: A little more caution from youthat is no trinket you carry .
FRODO: I carry nothing .
STRIDER: Indeed ? I can usually avoid being seen if I wish , but to disappear entirely that is a rare gift .
FRODO: Who are you ?
STRIDER: Are you frightened ?
FRODO: Yes .
STRIDER: Not nearly frightened enough . I know what hunts you . Frodo jumps at the sound of a noise in the corridor . Stride deftly draws his sword .
SAM: Let him go or I 'll have you , Longshanks !
STRIDER: You have a stout heart , little Hobbit , ut that alone wo n't save youYou can no longer wait for the Wizard , Frodo . They 're coming .
FRODO: Where are they ?
STRIDER: They were once men . Strider glances quickly at Frodo , then looks away
FRODO: Where are you taking us ?
STRIDER: Into the wild .
MERRY: How do , we know this Strider is a friend of Gandalf ?
FRODO: We have no choice but to trust him .
STRIDER: But where is he leading us ?
SAM: Did you hear that , Bill ? Rivendell ! We 're going to see the Elves !
STRIDER: Gentlemen , we do not stop until nightfall .
PIPPIN: What about breakfast ?
STRIDER: You 've already had it .
PIPPIN: We 've had one , yesbut what about Second Breakfast ?
MERRY: I do n't think he knows about second eakfast , Pip .
PIPPIN: What about Elvenses , Luncheon , Afternoon Tea , dinnerhe knows about them , does n't he ?
MERRY: I would n't count on it .
SARUMAN: The power of Isengard is at your command , Sauron , Lord of the Earth .
ORC OVERSEER: What orders from Mordor , my Lord . What does the eye command ?
SARUMAN: We have work to do .
ORC OVERSEER: The trees are strong , my Lord . Thei oots go deep .
SARUMAN: Rip them all down .
FRODO: What are you doing ?
MERRY: Tomatoes , sausages , and crispy bacon .
SAM: We saved some for you , Mr. Frodo .
FRODO: Put it out , you fools ! Put it out ! Frodo desperately kicks dirt on the fire !
PIPPIN: Oh , that 's niceash on my tomatoes !
FRODO: Go ! !
SAM: Back , you devils !
STRIDER: He 's been stabbed by a Morgul blade . The Morgul Blade suddenly meltsvanishing into the air like smoke . Strider throws the hilt down in disgust
SAM: Do something .
STRIDER: This is beyond my skill to heal . He needs Elvish medicine . Strider lifts Frodo onto his shoulders .
SAM: We are six days from Rivendell . Frodo groans .
STRIDER: Hold on , Frodo .
SAM: He 'll never make it ! Close on Frodohead lolling about , barely conscious .
FRODO: GandalfGandalf ?
PIPPIN: Is he going to die ? Frodo 's breathing is getting shallow . Strider looks out into the darkness .
STRIDER: No . He is passing into the shadow world , he will soon become a wraith like them .
MERRY: They 're close . Frodo gasps in sudden pain .
STRIDER: Sam , do you know the Athelas plant ? Sam looks blank .
SAM: Athelas ?
STRIDER: Kingsfoil .
SAM: Kingsfoil . Aye . It 's a weed .
STRIDER: It may help to slow the poison . Hurry !
ARWEN: Frodo , Im Arwentelin let thaed . I am Arwen , I have come here to help you . Lasto Beth nin , tolo Dan na ngalad . Hea my voice , come back to the light . Frodo 's eyes close .
PIPPIN: Who is she ?
ARWEN: Frodo ?
SAM: She 's an elf .
ARWEN: He 's fadinghe 's not gong to last . We must get him to my father . Stride quickly lifts Frodoplacing him on the horse .
PIPPIN: Where are you taking him ?
ARWEN: There are five Wraiths behind you , where the other four are , I do not know .
STRIDER: Dartho guin Berianrych le ad tolthathon . Stay with the hobbitsI'11 send horses for you . Close on Arwen grabbing the Reins of the horse .
ARWEN: Hon mabathon . Rochoh ellint im . I 'll take him . I 'm the faster rider . Stride clamps his hand over Arwen 's .
STRIDER: Andelu I ven . The road is too dangerous .
ARWEN: Frodo Fir . Ae anthradon I hir , tu gwaith nin beriatha hon . If I can cross the river , the power of my people can protect him .
PIPPIN: What are they saying ?
ARWEN: I do not fear them .
STRIDER: Arwenride hard , do n't look back .
ARWEN: Noro Lim , Asfaloth , Noro Lim !
SAM: What are you doing ! Those Wraiths are still out there !
ARWEN: Noro lim , Asfaloth !
WITCH KING: Give up the Halfling , she-elf ! She draws her sword and yells at the Witch King .
ARWEN: If you want him , come and claim him .
ARWEN: No , noFrodo , no ! Frodo , do n't give innot now !
FRODO: Where am I ?
GANDALF: Yes , I 'm here and you 're lucky to be here , too . A few more hours and you would have been beyond our aid . You have some strength in you , my dear Hobbit .
FRODO: What happened , Gandalf ? Why did n't you meet us ?
GANDALF: I 'm sorry Frodo .
SARUMAN: Get up ! So much for the power of the Ring or embrace your own destruction !
GANDALF: There is only one Lord of the Ring . Only one who can bend it to his willand he does not share power .
SARUMAN: So you have chosen death !
FRODO: Gandalf ! What is it ? Gandalf returns his attention to Frodo .
GANDALF: Nothing , Frodo
SAM: Frodo ! Frodo ! Bless you , you 're awake ! !
GANDALF: Sam has hardly left your side .
SAM: We were worried about youwere n't we , Mr. Gandalf ?
GANDALF: By the skills of Lord Elrond , you 're eginning to mend . ELROND , LORD OF THE HIGH ELVES , steps up to Frodo 's
ELROND: Welcome to Rivendell , Frodo Baggins . Frodo sits up , looking at Elrond with awe .
MERRY: Frodo ! Frodo !
FRODO: Bilbo !
BILBO: Hello , Frodo , my lad !
FRODO: Bilbo !
BILBO: I meant to go backwander the paths of Mirkwood , visit Laketown , see the Lonely Mountain againbut age , it seems , has finally caught up with me .
FRODO: I miss the ShireI spent all my childhood pretending I was off somewhere elseoff with you , on one of you adventures But my own adventure , turned out to be quite differentI 'm not like you , Bilbo .
BILBO: My dear boy
SAM: No , what have I forgotten ? Pull back to eveal Frodo , hands in his pocket , watching Sam .
FRODO: Packed already ? Sam looks up , startled .
SAM: No harm in being prepared . Frodo strolls to the edge of the Balcony .
FRODO: I thought you wanted to see the Elves , Sam ?
SAM: I do
FRODO: More than anything .
SAM: I did . It 's justwe did what Gandalf wanted , did n't we ? We got the Ring this far , to Rivendelland I thought seeing as how you 're on the mend , we 'd be off soon . Off home .
FRODO: You 're right , Sam . Frodo looks at Sam
ELROND: His strength returns .
GANDALF: That wound will never fully heal . He will carry it the rest of his life .
ELROND: And yet to have come so far still bearing the Ringthe hobbit has shown extraordinary resilience to its evil .
GANDALF: It is a burden he should never have to had to bear . We can ask no more of Frodo .
ELROND: Gandalf , the enemy is moving . Sauron 's forces are massing in the east . His eye is fixed on Rivendell . And Saruman , you tell me , has betrayed us . Our list of allies grows thin .
GANDALF: His treachery runs deeper than you know . By foul craft , Saruman has crossed Orc with Goblin Menhe is breeding an army in the caverns of Isengard . An army that can move in Sunlight and cover great distance at speed . Saruman is coming fo the Ring . Elrond turns and walks away
ELROND: This evil can not be concealed by the power of the ElvesWe do not have the strength to fight both Mordor and IsengardGandalfthe ring can not stay here . Gandalf turns and looks out the window .
GANDALF: It is in Men that we must place our hope .
ELROND: Men ? Men are weak . The race of Men is failing . The blood of Numenor is all but spent , its pride and dignity forgotten . It is because of men the Ring survives .
ISILDUR: No . Isildur turns and walks away
ELROND: Isildur ! !
GANDALF: There is one who could unite them , one who could re claim the thrown of Gondor .
ELROND: He turned from that path a long time ago . He has chosen exile .
BOROMIR: The shards of Narsilthe blade that cut the Ring from Sauron 's hand . Boromi picks up the sword and gently touches the Blade . Close on a small bloom of blood appears on Boromir 's finger
ARWEN: Why do you fear the past ? You are Isildur 's heirnot Isildur himself . You are not bound to his fate .
STRIDER: The same blood flows in my veinsthe same weakness
ARWEN: Your time will come . You will face the same eviland you will defeat it . A si i-duath u-orthor , Aragornu or le a u or nin . The shadow does not hold sway yetnot over you and not over me .
STRIDER: Nauthannim I ned ol reniannen . I thought I had strayed into a dream .
ARWEN: Gwenin in enniathu-arnech in naeth I se celich . Long years have passedyou did not have the care you carry now . Arwen looks into Strider 's eyes .
STRIDER: You said you 'd bind yourself to me , forsaking the immortal life of you people .
ARWEN: And to that I hold . I would rather share one lifetime with you than face all the ages of this world alone . Strider looks down . In his hand lies the Evenstar .
STRIDER: You can not give me this .
ARWEN: It is mine to give to whom I will , like my heart .
ELROND: Strangers from distant lands friends of old . You have been summoned here to answer the threat of Mordor . Middle-earth stands upon the brink of destruction . None can escape it . You will uniteo you will fall . Each race is bound to this fatethis one doom
BOROMIR: So it is true !
LEGOLAS: Sauron 's Ring ! The ring of power !
GIMLI: The doom of man !
BOROMIR: It is a gifta gift to the foes of Mordor ! Why not use this Ring ? Long has my father , the Steward of Gondor , held the forces of Mordor at bayby the lood of our people are your lands kept safe . Give Gondor the weapon of the enemylet us use it against him !
STRIDER: You can not wield it . None of us can . The one ring answers to Sauron aloneit has no other master . Boromir turns and looks at Strider , coolly .
BOROMIR: And what would a ranger know of this matter ?
LEGOLAS: This is no mere Ranger . He is Aragorn , son of Arathorn . You owe him you allegiance .
BOROMIR: Aragorn ? This is Isildur 's heir ?
LEGOLAS: And heir to the throne of Gondor .
ARAGORN: Havo dad , LegolasSit down , Legolas..
BOROMIR: Gondor needs no king .
GANDALF: Aragorn is rightwe can not use it .
ELROND: You have only one choice..the ring must e destroyed .
GIMLI: Thenwhat are we waiting for ?
ELROND: The ring can not be destroyed , Gimli , son of Gloin , by any craft that we
BOROMIR: One does not simply walk into Mordor . Its lack gates are guarded by more than just Orcs . There is evil there that does not sleep and the Great Eye is ever watchful . It is a barren wasteland , riddled with fire and ash and dustthe very air you eathe is a poisonous fume . Not with ten thousand men could you do this . It is folly .
LEGOLAS: Have you heard nothing Lord Elrond has said ? The ring must be destroyed .
GIMLI: And I suppose you think you 're the one to do it ?
BOROMIR: And if we fail , what then ? What happens when Sauron takes back what is his ? Gimli leaps to his feet !
GIMLI: I will be dead before I see the Ring in the hands of an Elf ! A STORM OF ARGUMENT erupts around the room . CLOSE ON FRODOsound disappears as he watches in slow
GANDALF: Do you not understand ? While we bicke among ourselves , Sauron 's power grows ! No one will escape it . You will all be destroyed , your homes burnt and you families put to the sword !
FRODO: I will take itI will take itI will take the Ring to Mordor .
GANDALF: I will help you bear this burden , Frodo Baggins , as long as it is yours to bear .
ARAGORN: If , by my life or death , I can protect you , I will . you have my sword . Aragorn steps forwardfollowed by Legolas and Gimli .
LEGOLAS: And you have my bow .
GIMLI: And my axe .
BOROMIR: You carry the fate of us all , little one . Boromir looks towards Elrond and Gandalf .
SAM: Here !
ELROND: No , Indeedit is hardly possible to separate youeven when he is summoned to a secret council and you are not .
MERRY: Oi ! We 're coming too ! You 'll have to send us home tied up in a sack to stop us .
PIPPIN: Anywayyou need people of intelligence on this sort of missionquestthing
MERRY: Well , that rules you out , Pip .
ELROND: Nine companions so be it . You shall be the `` Fellowship of the ring ''
PIPPIN: Great . Where are we going ?
BILBO: My old sword `` Sting '' here , take it ! Bilbo offers Sting to Frodo .
FRODO: It 's so light !
BILBO: Yes , yes , made by the Elves , you know . The blade glows blue when Orcs are closeand it 's times like that , my lad , when you have to be extra careful .
BOROMIR: Get away from the blade , Pippinon you toesgood , very goodI want you to eact , not think .
SAM: Should not be too hard
BOROMIR: Move your feet .
MERRY: Quite good , Pippin .
PIPPIN: Thanks .
GIMLI: If anyone were to ask for my opinion , which I note they have not , I would say we are taking the long way round . Gandalf , we can pass through the Mines of Moria . My cousin , Balin , would give us a oyal welcome . Gandalf clearly thinks that is a bad idea .
GANDALF: No , Gimli . I would not take the road through Moria unless I had no othe choice .
SAM: What is that ?
GIMLI: Nothingit 's just a wisp of a cloud .
BOROMIR: It 's moving fastagainst the wind .
LEGOLAS: Crebain from Dunland !
ARAGORN: Hide !
BOROMIR: Merry..PippinSamtake cover ! WIDE ON THE FELLOWSHIP scramble under what little cove
GANDALF: Spies of Saruman . The passage South is eing watched .
ARAGORN: Boromir ?
BOROMIR: It is a strange fate that we should suffer so much fear and doubt over so small a thingsuch a little thing .
ARAGORN: Boromirgive the ring to Frodo . ARAGORN 'S HAND moves to his sword hilt .
BOROMIR: As you wish . I care not .
SARUMAN: So , Gandalfyou try to lead them ove Caradhras . And if that failswhere then will you go ? THE FELLOWSHIP struggles through the snow .
LEGOLAS: There is a fell voice in the air .
GANDALF: It 's Saruman .
ARAGORN: He 's trying to bring down the mountain . Gandalf ! We must turn back !
GANDALF: No !
BOROMIR: We must get off the mountain ! Make fo the gap of Rohan and take the West road to my city .
ARAGORN: The Gap of Rohan takes us too close to Isengard .
GIMLI: We can not pass over the mountain . Let us go under it . Let us go through the mines of Moria . Gandalf has a concerned look on his face .
GANDALF: Let the ringbearer decide .
FRODO: We will go through the mines . Gandalf slowly nods .
GANDALF: So be it .
GIMLI: The walls of Moria !
GANDALF: Itidinit mirrors only starlight and moonlight .
MERRY: What do you suppose that means ?
GANDALF: It 's quite simple . If you are a friend , speak the password and the doors will open . Gandalf raises his arms
ARAGORN: Mines are no place for a Pony , even one so brave as Bill .
SAM: Bye , Bill .
ARAGORN: Go on , Bill , go on..do n't worry , Samhe knows his way home . Aragorn slaps Bill on the rumpBill goes trotting off . CLOSE ON Sam watching Bill disappear into the darkness .
SAM: Goodbye , Bill .
ARAGORN: Do not disturb the water .
FRODO: It 's a riddle Gandalf raises his eyebrows
GANDALF: Ohmellon .
GIMLI: So , master elf , you will enjoy the fabled hospitality of the dwarves ; roaring fires , malt beer , red meat off the bone . This , my friend , is the home of my cousin , Balinand they call this a Mine A mine !
BOROMIR: This is no mineit 's a tomb !
GIMLI: Ohnono..no ! Legolas pulls a crude arrow out of a skeleton .
LEGOLAS: Goblins !
BOROMIR: We make for the Gap of Rohan . We should never have come here .
GANDALF: Into the mines !
BOROMIR: Legolas !
GANDALF: We now have but one choicewe must face the long dark of Moria . Be on you guardthere are older and fouler things than the Orcs in the deep places of the world .
PIPPIN: Are we lost ?
MERRY: No . I do n't think we are . Shhhh , Gandalf 's thinking .
PIPPIN: Merry !
MERRY: What ?
PIPPIN: I 'm hungry .
FRO DO: There 's something down there .
GANDALF: It 's Gollum .
FRODO: Gollum !
GANDALF: He 's been following us for three days .
FRODO: He escaped the dungeons of Barad- dur ?
GANDALF: Escapedor was set loose . And now the Ring has drawn him herehe will neve e rid of his need for it . He hates and loves the ring , as he hates and loves himself . Smeagol 's life is a sad story . Gandalf catches Frodo 's look of surprise .
FRODO: It 's a pity Bilbo did n't kill him when he had the chance .
GANDALF: Pity ? It was pity that stayed Bilbo 's hand . Many that live deserve death , and some that die deserve life . Can you give it to them , Frodo ? Frodo frowns .
FRODO: I wish the ring had never come to meI wish none of this had happened .
GANDALF: So do all who live to see such times , but that is not for them to decide . All we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given to us . There is a note of finality in Gandalf 's voice .
MERRY: He 's remembered !
GANDALF: No , but the air does n't smell so foul down there . If in doubt , Meriadoc , always follow your nose ! Ye s
GALADRIEL: Let me risk a little more light . Gandalf taps his stafffor a brief moment a light
GANDALF: Behold ! The great realm and Dwarf city of Dwarrowdelf ! Frodo gasps at the brief sight of a vast roof , far above
SAM: Well , there 's an eye opener and no mistake !
GANDALF: Gimli ! !
GIMLI: Nonooh , no ! Gimli sobs .
GANDALF: `` Here lies Balin , son of Fudin , Lord of Moria . '' He is dead , then . It 's as I had feared .
LEGOLAS: We must move on , we can not linger .
GANDALF: `` They have taken the Bridge and the second hall we have barred the gatesbut can not hold them fo longthe ground shakesdrums in the deepwe can not get out . A shadow moves in the dark . Will no- one save us ? They are coming . ''
SAM: Mr. Frodo !
LEGOLAS: Orcs !
ARAGORN: Get back ! Stay close to Gandalf .
BOROMIR: They have a cave troll !
GIMLI: Let them come ! There is one Dwarf yet in Moria who still draws breath !
SAM: I think I 'm getting the hang of this .
FRODO: Aragorn ! Aragorn !
ARAGORN: Frodo ! !
SAM: He 's alive !
FRODO: I 'm alright . I 'm not hurt .
ARAGORN: You should be dead . That spear would 've skewered a wild boar !
GANDALF: I think there 's more to this hobbit than meets the eye .
GIMLI: Mithril ! You are full of surprises , Master Baggins .
GANDALF: To the bridge of Khazad-dum !
BOROMIR: What is this new devilry ?
GANDALF: A Balrog..a demon of the ancient world ! This foe is beyond any of you ! Run ! Quickly !
GIMLI: Nobody tosses a dwarf ! The BALROG smashes through the wall and spreads its vast wings .
GANDALF: Over the bridge ! Fly !
FRODO: Gandalf !
GANDALF: I am a servant of the Secret Fire , wielder of the flame of Anor . The dark fire will not avail you , flame of Udun .
FRODO: Gandalf !
GANDALF: Fly , you fools !
FRODO: No !
ARAGORN: Gandalf ! They rush towards an archway .
BOROMIR: Give them a momentfor pity 's sake !
ARAGORN: By nightfall these hills will be swarming with Orcs ! We must reach the woods of Lothlorien . Come , Boromir , Legolas , Gimli , get them up . On your feet , Sam .
GIMLI: Stay close , young hobbits..they say a Sorceress lives in these woods . An elf- witch of terrible power . All who look upon her fall under her spell
SAM: Mr. Frodo ?
GIMLI: Well , here 's one dwarf she wo n't ensnare so easily . I have the eyes of a hawk and the ears of a fox !
HALDIR: The dwarf breathes so loud we could have shot him in the dark .
ARAGORN: Haldir of Lorien , we come here for you help . We need your protection .
GIMLI: Aragorn ! These woods are perilous . We should go back .
HALDIR: You have entered the realm of the Lady of the Wood . You can not go back . Haldir 's eyes lock onto Frodo .
CELEBORN: Eight there are , yet nine there were set out from Rivendell . Tell me , where is Gandalf , for I much desire to speak with him .
LEGOLAS: A lament for Gandalf
MERRY: What do they say about him ?
LEGOLAS: I have not the heart to tell you . For me , the grief is still too near . Boromir is sitting aloneAragorn approaches him .
ARAGORN: Take some rest..these borders are well protected .
BOROMIR: I will find no rest here . I heard he voice inside my headshe spoke of my father and the fall of Gondor , and she said to me `` Even now , there
ARAGORN: I have seen the white city..long ago .
BOROMIR: One day our paths will lead us there , and the tower guards shall take up the call `` the Lords of Gondor have returned . ''
GALADRIEL: Will you look into the mirror ? Frodo looks with apprehension at the silve asin .
FRODO: What will I see ?
GALADRIEL: Even the wisest can not tell for the mirror shows many thingsthings that were ..things that areand some things that have not yet come to pass .
FRODO: Gandalf !
GALADRIEL: I know what it is you sawfor it is also in my mind . It is the future , Frodo . It is what will come to pass if you should fail .
GALADRIEL: You offer it to me freelyI do not deny that my heart has greatly desired this .
FRODO: I can not do this alone
GALADRIEL: You are the ring-bearer , Frodoto bea a ring of power is to be alone . This task was appointed to you , and if you do not find a way , no one will . Frodo realizes what her message is .
FRODO: Then I know what I must do . It 's justI 'm afraid to do it . Galadriel kneels down to Frodo 's height , staring at him intently .
GALADRIEL: Even the smallest person can change the course of the future .
LURTZ: Saruman .
SARUMAN: Hunt them down . Do not stop until they are found . You do not know pain . You do not know fear . You will taste man-flesh . Saruman turns to Lurtz .
GALADRIEL: Farewell , Frodo Baggins . I give you the light of Earendil , our most beloved star .
ARAGORN: Frodo .
ARAGORN: We cross the lake at nightfall , hide the oats and continue on foot..we approach Mordor from the North .
GIMLI: Oh , yes , just a simple matter of finding our way through Emyn Muil , an impassable labyrinth of razor sharp rocks . And after that gets even bettera festering , stinking marshland , far as the eye can see .
ARAGORN: That is our RoadI suggest you take some rest and recover your strength , Master Dwarf .
GIMLI: Recover my Legolas turns to Aragorn with urgency .
LEGOLAS: We should leave now .
ARAGORN: No . Orcs patrol the Eastern shore . We must wait for cover of darkness .
LEGOLAS: It is not the Eastern shore that worries me .
MERRY: Where 's Frodo ?
BOROMIR: None of us should wander alone ; you least of all . So much depends on youFrodo ?
FRODO: I know what you would say , and it would seem like wisdom but for the warning of my heart .
BOROMIR: Warning ? Against what ?
FRODO: There is no other way .
BOROMIR: I ask only for the strength to defend my people . If you would but lend me the ring
FRODO: No . . . Frodo steps hurriedly away from Boromir .
BOROMIR: Why do you recoil ? I am no thief .
FRODO: You are not yourself .
BOROMIR: What chance do you think you have ? They will find you , they will take the ring and you will beg for death before the end . Frodo turns to leave .
FRODO DISAPPEARS: Boromir spins wildly around , yelling into thin air !
BOROMIR: I see your mindyou will take the ring to Sauron . You will betray us ! You go to your death and the death of us all .
ARAGORN: Frodo ?
FRODO: It has taken Boromir . ARAGORN moves towards Frodo
ARAGORN: Where is the ring ?
FRODO: Stay away !
ARAGORN: FrodoI swore to protect you .
FRODO: Can you protect me from yourself ?
ARAGORN: I would have gone with you to the end into the very fires of Mordor .
FRODO: I knowLook after the others , especially Samhe will not understand . Aragorn freezes ! He draws his sword .
ARAGORN: Go , Frodo ! Frodo hesitates .
SAM: Mr. Frodo !
LURTZ: Find the Halflings find the halflings !
PIPPIN: Come on
MERRY: He 's leaving .
PIPPIN: No !
MERRY: Pippin !
LEGOLAS: The horn of Gondor !
ARAGORN: Boromir !
BOROMIR: Run ! Run !
ARAGORN: I let Frodo go . Boromir holds Aragorn 's gaze .
BOROMIR: Then you did what I could not . I tried to take the ring from him .
ARAGORN: The ring is beyond our reach now .
BOROMIR: Forgive me , I did not see..I have failed you all .
ARAGORN: No , Boromir . You fought bravely . You have kept your honor . Aragorn tries to ind Boromir 's wound .
BOROMIR: Leave it ! It is overthe world of Men will fall and all will come to darkness and my city to ruin..Aragorn..
ARAGORN: I do not know what strength is in my lood , but I swear to you I will not let the White City fall , nor your people fail
BOROMIR: Our peopleour people
ARAGORN: Be at peace , son of Gondor . Aragorn bends and Kisses Boromir 's forehead .
SAM: Mr. Frodo !
FRODO: No , Sam . Sam looks at the waterthen at the boat .
SAM: Of course you areand I 'm coming with you !
FRODO: You ca n't swim .
SAM: I made a promise , Mr. Frodoa promise . `` Do n't you leave him , Samwise Gamgee . '' And I do n't mean toI do n't mean to .
FRODO: Oh , Sam !
LEGOLAS: If we are quick , we will catch Frodo and Sam before nightfall .
ARAGORN: Frodo 's fate is no longer in our hands .
GIMLI: Then it has all been in vainthe fellowship has failed .
ARAGORN: Not if we hold true to each other . We will not abandon Merry and Pippin to torment and death , not while we have strength left .
GIMLI: Yes ! Ha !
FRODO: Mordor ! I hope the others find a safe oad .
SAM: Strider 'll look after them .
FRODO: I do n't suppose we 'll ever see them again .
SAM: We may yet , Mr. Frodo . We may .
FRODO: Sam ?
DEAGOL: Smeagol , I 've got one ! I 've got a fish , Smeagol !
SMEAGOL: Go on , pull it in .
DEAGOL: Why ? CLOSE ON SMEAGOL moves towards DEAGOL . . .
SMEAGOL: Because its my birthday , and I wants it .
GOLLUM: It 's mine ! My own . It came to me .

SAM: Have n't you had any sleep , Mr Frodo ? FRODO shakes his HEAD . SAM I 've gone and had too much !

GANDALF: Run Shadowfax , show us the meaning of haste .
PIPPIN: Merry ! SHADOWFAX thunders out of the STABLES ! CLOSE ON MERRY 'S devastated face .
ELF ESCORT: We can not delay .
ELROND: Arwen ?
ARWEN: You have the gift of foresight - tell me what you have seen .
ELROND: I looked into your future and I saw death .
ELROND: That future is almost gone .
ARWEN: But it is not lost
ELROND: Nothing is certain .
ARWEN: Some things are certain . If I leave him now I will regret It forever . Ada , it is time .

DENETHOR: You think you are wise , Mithrandir , yet fo all your subtleties.you have not wisdom . Do you think the eyes of the White Tower are lind ? I have seen more than you know . With your left hand you would use me as a shield against Mordor and with your right you would seek to supplant me .
GANDALF: Authority is not given to you to deny the eturn of the King - Steward !
DENETHOR: The rule of Condor is mine , and no others !
GANDALF: Come .
PIPPIN: So , I imagine this is just a ceremonial position . . . I mean , they do n't actually expect me to do any fighting . . . do they ?
GANDALF: You 're in the service of the Steward now - you 're going to have to do as you 're told , Peregrin Took . . . Guard of the Citadel !
PIPPIN: It 's so quiet . GANDALF watches the young HOBBIT .
GANDALF: It 's the deep breath before the plunge .
PIPPIN: I do n't want to be in a battle . . . but waiting on the edge of one I ca n't escape
GANDALF: There never was much hope .
PIPPIN: But we have the White Wizard . That 's got to count for something .
GANDALF: The Witchking of Angmar . . . ( he looks down at a startled

EOMER: Now is the hour ! Riders of Rohan - oaths you have taken . Now , fulfil them all - to Lord and land !
MADRIL: We ca n't hold them . The city is lost !

FARAMIR: What would you have me do ?
DENETHOR: I will not yield the River and Pelenno unfought - Osgiliath must be retaken .
FARAMIR: My Lord , Osgiliath is overrun .
DENETHOR: Much must be risked in war . Is there a Captain here who still has the courage to do his Lord 's will ?
FARAMIR: You wish now that our places had been exchanged , that I had died and Boromir had lived ?
DENETHOR: Yes , I wish that .
FARAMIR: Since you are robbed of Boromir , I will do what I can in his stead .
DENETHOR: That will depend on the manner of you eturn .
SAM: What are you up to ? Sneaking off , are we ?
SMEAGOL: Sneaking ? Sneaking ? Fat Hobbit is always so polite . Smeagol shows them secret ways that nobody else could find and they say `` Sneak ! `` , `` Sneak ! '' . Very nice friends , oh yes , my Precious , very nice .
SAM: Alright , alright - you just startled me is all . What were you doing ?
SMEAGOL: Sneaking ! Too exhausted to argue , SAM turns away .
SAM: Fine , have it your own way .
FRODO: What ? That 's all we have left ! SAM slowly turns to GOLLUM
SAM: He took it ! He must have !
GOLLUM: Smeagol ? No , no , not poor Smeagol . Smeagol hates nasty Elf bread !
SAM: You 're a lying wretch ! What did you do with it ?
FRODO: He does n't eat it . . . he ca n't have taken it .
GOLLUM: What 's this ? Crumbs on his jacketses ! He took it ! He took it ! I seen him , he 's always stuffing himself when Master 's not looking !

SAM: No , no , you 're not alright ! You 're exhausted ! It 's that Gollum ; it 's this place ; it 's that thing around your neck . I could help a bit . . . I could carry it for a while - share the load .
FRODO: Get away !
SAM: I do n't want to keep it . . . I just want to help !
GOLLUM: See ! See ! He wants it for himself .
SAM: Shut up , you ! Go away . Get out of here .
FRODO: No , Sam . . . it 's you . SAM stares at FRODO with DISBELIEF .
SAM: But . . . he 's a liar . . . he 's poisoned you against me .
FRODO: You ca n't help me anymore .
SAM: You do n't mean that .
FRODO: Go home .
GANDALF: Faramir ! Your father 's will has turned to madness ! Do not throw away your life so ashly !
FARAMIR: Where does my allegiance lie if not here ?
GANDALF: Your father loves you , Faramir ! And will remember it before the end .
DENETHOR: Can you sing , Master Hobbit ?
PIPPIN: Well . . . yes , at least , well enough for my own people but we have no songs fo great halls and evil times . . . we seldom sing of anything more terrible than wind o ain .
DENETHOR: And why should your songs be unfit for my halls , or for hours such as these . Come - sing me a song !
THEODEN: Grimbold , how many ?

DENETHOR: Where are the riders from Snowbourne ?
THEODEN: Six thousand spears . . . less than half of what I had hoped for . . . ANGLE ON ARAGORN turns to THEODEN

THEODEN: More will come .
EOMER: They grow nervous in the shadow of the mountain . . .
GIMLI: That road there - where does that lead ?
LEGOLAS: It is the road to the Dimholt The doo under the mountain .
EOMER: None who venture there ever return . That mountain is evil . . .

GIMLI: Let 's find some food .
EOWYN: There ! A true Esquire of Rohan .
MERRY: Sorry . It is n't all that dangerous . It is n't even sharp .
EOWYN: Well , that 's no good . You wo n't kill many Ores with a blunt blade . Come on .
EOMER: You should not encourage him .
EOWYN: And you should not doubt him .
EOMER: I do not doubt his heart Only the reach of his arm .
EOWYN: Why should Merry be left behind ? He has as much cause to go to war as you . Why can he not fight for those he loves ?

ARAGORN: She stayed ?
ELROND: She will not long survive the evil that now spreads from Mordor .
ARAGORN: It will not be our end , but his .

ARAGORN: There are none . ELROND hesitates a BEAT
ELROND: There are those who dwell in the mountain .
ARAGORN: Murderers , traitors - you would call upon them to fight ? They believe in nothing . They answer to no-one .
ELROND: They will answer to the King of Condor .
ARAGORN: Sauron will not have forgotten the sword of Elendil . . .
ELROND: The man who can wield the power of this sword can summon to him an army more deadly than any that walks this earth . ELROND stares hard at ARAGORN . . . ELROND Put aside the Ranger - become who you were orn to be - take the Dimhplt Road . A HEAVY SILENCE hangs in the room . ELROND Onen i-estel Edain . , , - , < I give hope to Men . - .. .

ARAGORN: Eowyn . . .
· EOWYN: We need you here - ,
ARAGORN: Why have you come ?
EOWYN: Do you not know ?
ARAGORN: It is but a shadow and a thought that you love . . . I can not give you what you seek .
GIMLI: And just where do you think you 're off to ?
ARAGORN: Not this time This time you must stay , my friend .
LEGOLAS O.S: Have you learnt nothing of the stubbornness of Dwarves ?
GIMLI: You might as well accept it - we 're going with you , laddie .
GAMLING: Lord Aragorn !
THEODEN: He leaves because he must .
GAMLING: Too few have come . We can not defeat the armies of Mordor .
THEODEN: No , we can not . . . But we will meet them in battle , nonetheless .
EOWYN: What other duty would you have me do , my Lord ?
THEODEN: Duty ? No , I would have you smile again - not grieve for those whose time has come . EOWYN slowly lifts her head . . . THEODEN You shall live to see these days renewed .
GIMLI: What kind of an army would linger in such a place ?
LEGOLAS: One that is cursed Long ago the Men of the Mountain swore an oath to the last King of Condor - to come to his aid , to fight , ut when the time came , when Condor 's need was dire , they fled Vanishing into the darkness of the mountain And so Isildu cursed them - never to rest until they had fulfilled their pledge .
GIMLI: The very warmth of my blood seems stolen away .
LEGOLAS: The way is shut . It was made by those who are dead , and the Dead keep it . The way is shut .
ARAGORN: Brego !
GIMLI: Well , this is a thing unheard of An Elf will go underground when a Dwarf dare not . Oh ! I ' d never hear the end of it !
THEODEN: We must ride light and swift . It 's a long oad ahead and man and beast must reach the end with the strength to fight .
MERRY: All my friends have gone to battle . I would e ashamed to be left behind !
THEODEN: It is a three day gallop to Minas Tirith . None of my Riders can bear you as a burden .
MERRY: But . . . I want to fight !
THEODEN: I will say no more . KING THEODEN wheels his HORSE away . . .
EOWYN: Ride with me .
MERRY: My Lady !
EOMER: Move out - move out !
THEODEN: Ride ! Ride now , for Gondor !
ARAGORN: One who will have your allegiance .
ARAGORN: I summon you to fulfil your oath !

FRODO: There are so many of them . . . So many . We 'll never get through unseen .
SAM: We have to go in there , Mr Frodo . There 's nothing for it . Come on . Let 's just make it down the hill for starters .
GANDALF: Frodo has passed beyond my sight . The darkness is deepening .
ARAGORN: If Sauron had the .Ring , we would know it .
GANDALF: It 's only a matter of time . He has suffered a defeat , yes , but behind the walls of Mordor our enemy is regrouping .
GIMLI: Let him stay there . Let him rot . Why should we care ?
GANDALF: Because ten thousand Ores now stand between Frodo and Mount Doom .
ARAGORN: No . GANDALF looks up sharply at ARAGORN . . . ARAGORN There is still hope for Frodo . He needs time and safe passage across the Plains of Gorgoroth . We can give him that .
GANDALF: How ?
ARAGORN: Draw out Sauron ' s armies - empty his lands . Then we gather our full strength and march on the Black Gate .
EOMER: We can not achieve victory from strength of arms .
ARAGORN: Not for ourselves . . . But we can give Frodo his chance if we keep Sauron ' s eye fixed upon us . Keep him blind to all else that moves .
LEGOLAS: A diversion . . .
GANDALF: Sauron will suspect a trap . He will not take the bait !
GIMLI: Certainty of death . Small chance of success . What are we waiting for ?
SAM: Look , the Ores ! They 're moving off . You see , Mr Frodo - some luck at last .
SAM: Take mine . . . there 's a few drops left .
FRODO: There 'll be none left for the return journey .
SAM: I do n't think there will be a return journey , Mr Frodo .
PIPPIN: Where are they ?
ARAGORN: Let the lord of the Black Land come forth ; let justice be done upon him .
SAM: It 's gone , Mr Frodo . ANGLE ON SAM crawls toward FRODO . . . SAM The light 's passed on , away towards the North . . . something 's drawn it 's gaze .
ARAGORN: Hold your ground - hold your ground ! Sons of Gondor - of Rohan . . . my brothers !
GIMLI: Never thought I ' d die fighting side by side with an Elf .
LEGOLAS: What about side by side with a friend ?
GIMLI: Aye - I could do that .
SAM: Do you remember the Shire , Mr Frodo ? . . . It 'll be spring soon , and the orchards will be in blossom ; and the birds will be nesting in the hazel thicket ; and they'11 e sowing the summer barley in the lowe fields ; and eating the first of the strawberries with cream . Do you remember the taste of strawberries ?
FRODO: No , Sam . I ca n't recall the taste of food ; nor the sound of water ; nor the touch of grass . . . I 'm naked in the dark .
SAM: Then let us be rid of it - once and fo all ! Come on , Mr Frodo . I ca n't carry it for you but I can carry you ! Come on !
ARAGORN: For Frodo . . .
GOLLUM: Clever Hobbits to climb so high !
SAM: Frodo ! FRODO has GONE !
PIPPIN: Eagles . . .
SAM: Frodo !
FRODO: I 'm here , Sam .
SAM: Destroy it - go on ! Throw it in the fire !
FRODO: The Ring is mine . SAM SCREAMS as . . . FRODO PUTS THE RING ON ! He VANISHES !
SAM: No !
GOLLUM: Precious ! Precious !
SAM: Give me your hand .
SAM: Yes , Mr. Frodo it 's over now .
FRODO: I can see the Shire The Brandywine River , Bag End , Gandalf 's fireworks . . . the lights in the Party Tree . . .
SAM: Rosie Cotton dancing she had ribbons in her hair . . . . . . if ever I was to marry someone . . . it would have been her . . . it would have been her . FRODO glances at SAM . . . he is WEEPING .
FRODO: I 'm glad to be with you , Samwise Gamgee . . . here at the end of all things .
GANDALF: Now come the days of the King ARAGORN smiles up at GANDALF . . . GANDALF May they be blessed .
ARAGORN: This day does not belong to one man but to all . Let us together rebuild this world that we may share in the days of peace . The CHEERS of his PEOPLE are DEAFENING
SAM O.S: Mr Frodo ?
FRODO: It 's been four years to the day since Weathertop , Sam . It 's never really healed .
BILBO: Frodo Any chance of seeing that old ing of mine the one I gave you ?
FRODO: Sorry , Uncle . . . I 'm afraid , I lost it .
BILBO: Oh . . . pity . I should like to have held it
GALADRIEL: The power of the Three Rings is ended . The time has come for the Dominion of Men .
ELROND: I Aear can ven na mar . T he Sea calls us ho me .
BILBO: I think I 'm quite ready for anothe adventure .
GANDALF: Farewell , my brave Hobbits . My work is now finished . Here at last , on the shores of the sea , comes the end of our Fellowship .
SAM: What does he mean ? CLOSE ON FRODO turns to SAM . . . .
FRODO: We set out to save the Shire , and it has een saved but not for me . . .
SAM: You do n't mean that - you ca n't leave .
FRODO: The last pages are for you , Sam .
SAM: Elanor ! He hugs his daughter . . .
GANDALF: You can not pass !
FRODO: Gandalf !
GANDALF: I am a servant of the Secret Fire , wielde of the Flame of Anor !
BOROMIR: No ! No !
FRODO: Gandalf !
GANDALF: Fly , you fools !
FRODO: Noooooooooooooooo ! ! ! !
SAM: What is it , Mr. Frodo ?
FRODO: Nothing . Just a dream .
SAM: Mordor . The one place in Middle-earth we don ’ t want to see any closer , and the one place we ’ re trying to get to . It ’ s just where we can ’ t get . Let ’ s face it , Mr. Frodo , we ’ re lost . I don ’ t think Gandalf meant for us to come this way .
FRODO: He didn ’ t mean for a lot of things to happen , Sam but they did .
SAM: Mr. Frodo ? It ’ s the Ring , isn ’ t it ?
FRODO: It ’ s getting heavier .
SAM: Well , let me see . Oh yes , lovely – Lembas bread . And look ! More lembas ead .
FRODO: Nothing ever dampens your spirits , does it Sam ?
SAM: Those rain clouds might .
FRODO: It ’ s because we ’ ve been here before ! We ’ re going in circles .
SAM: Ah ! What 's that 'orrid stink ? I 'll warrant there 's a nasty bog nearby . Can you smell it ?
FRODO: Yes . I can smell it . We ’ re not alone .
[NIGHTTIME: Frodo and Sam are sleeping . A dark shape appears on top of the cliff . The creature Gollum has appeared and is making his way down to the hobbits . ]
GOLLUM: The thieves ! The thieves ! The filthy little thieves ! Where is it ? Where isss it ? They stole it from us . My preciousss . Curse them ! We hates them ! It ’ s ours , it is and we wantssss it !
FRODO: This is Sting . You ’ ve seen it before , haven ’ t you Gollum ! Release him or I ’ ll cut your throat !
GOLLUM: It burns ! It burns us ! It freezes ! Nasty Elves twisted it . Take it off us !
SAM: Quiet you !
GOLLUM: No ! That would kill us ! Kill us !
SAM: It ’ s no more than you deserve !
FRODO: Maybe he does deserve to die , but now that I see him , I do pity him .
GOLLUM: We be nice to them if they e nice to us . Take it off us . We swears to do what you wants . We swears .
FRODO: There ’ s no promise you can make that I can trust .
GOLLUM: We swears to serve the master of the preciousss . We swears on on the precious . *Gollum . Gollum . *
FRODO: The Ring is treacherous . It will hold you to your word .
GOLLUM: Yes on the preciousss . On the preciousss .
SAM: I don ’ t believe you ! Get down ! I said , down !
FRODO: Sam !
SAM: He ’ s trying to trick us ! We let him go he ’ ll throttle us in our sleep !
FRODO: You know the way to Mordor ?
GOLLUM: Yes
FRODO: You ’ ve been there before ?
GOLLUM: Yes
FRODO: You will lead us to the Black Gate .
PIPPIN: Merry . Merry !
UGLÚK: What is it ? What do you smell ?
PIPPIN: Aragorn !
UGLÚK: They 've picked up our trail ! Let 's move !
ARAGORN: Their pace has quickened . They must have caught our scent . Hurry !
LEGOLAS: Come on , Gimli !
GIMLI: Three days ’ and nights ’ pursuit . No food . No rest . And no sign of our quarry but what bare rock can tell .
ARAGORN: Not idly do the leaves of Lórien fall .
LEGOLAS: They may yet be alive .
ARAGORN: Less than a day ahead of us . Come !
LEGOLAS: Come , Gimli ! We are gaining on them !
GIMLI: I am wasted on cross-country ! We dwarves are natural sprinters ! Very dangerous over short distances !
ARAGORN: Rohan . Home of the horse-lords . There is something strange at work here . Some evil gives speed to these creatures , sets its will against us .
LEGOLAS: The Uruks turn northeast . They ’ re taking the hobbits to Isengard !
ARAGORN: Saruman .
SARUMAN: The horsemen took your land . They drove your people into the hills to scratch a living off rocks .
DUNLAND MAN: Murderers !
SARUMAN: Take back the lands they stole from you ! Burn every village !
CROWD: Argh ! !
MORWEN: Éothain ! Éothain ! You take your sister . You ’ ll go faster with just two .
FREDA: Papa says Éothain must not ride Garulf , he is too big for him !
MORWEN: Listen to me . You must ride to Edoras and raise the alarm . Do you understand me ?
ÉOTHAIN: Yes , Ma !
FREDA: I don ’ t wan na leave ! I do n't wan na go , Mama !
MORWEN: Freda , I will find you there .
ÉOWYN: Théodred !
ÉOMER: He was ambushed by Orcs . If we don ’ t defend our country , Saruman will take it by force .
GRÍMA: That is a lie ! Saruman the White has ever been ou friend and ally .
THÉODEN: Gríma… Gríma… My son ? Gríma ?
ÉOMER: Orcs are roaming freely across our lands . Unchecked . Unchallenged . Killing at will . Orcs bearing the white hand of Saruman .
GRÍMA: Why do you lay these troubles on an already troubled mind . Can you not see ? Your uncle is wearied by your malcontent , your war-mongering .
ÉOMER: War-mongering ?
GRÍMA: You see much Éomer , Son of Éomund . Too much . You are banished forthwith from the kingdom of Rohan . Under pain of death !
ÉOMER: Argh ! !
GIMLI: Keep breathing ! That ’ s the key ! Breathe ! Ho !
LEGOLAS: They ’ ve run as if the very whips of their masters were behind them .
MORDOR ORC: We ’ re not going no further till we ’ ve had a breather !
UGLÚK: Get a fire going !
PIPPIN: Merry ! Merry !
MERRY: I think we might have made a mistake leaving the Shire , Pippin .
PIPPIN: What ’ s making that noise ?
MERRY: It ’ s the trees .
PIPPIN: What ?
MERRY: Do you remember the Old Forest ? On the orders of Buckland ? Folk used to say that there was something in the wate that made the trees grow tall and come alive .
PIPPIN: Alive ?
MERRY: Trees that could whisper . Talk to each other . Even move .
MAÚHUR: I 'm starving . We ai n't 'ad nothin ' but maggoty bread for three stinkin ' days !
SNAGA: Yeah . Why can ’ t we have some meat ? What about them ? They ’ re fresh .
UGLÚK: They are not for eating !
GRISHNÁKH: What about their legs ? They do n't need those . Ooh… They look tasty !
UGLÚK: Get back , scum !
MORDOR ORC: Carve them up !
SNAGA: Just a mouth full .
UGLÚK: No !
MERRY: Pippin , let ’ s go .
GRISHNÁKH: Go on , call for help . Squeal ! No one ’ s gon na save you now !
MERRY: Pippin !
PIPPIN: ARGH ! ! !
LEGOLAS: A red sun rises . Blood has been spilled this night .
ARAGORN: Riders of Rohan , what news from the Mark ?
ÉOMER: What business does an Elf , a man and a Dwarf have in the Riddermark ? Speak quickly !
GIMLI: Give me your name , Horsemaster , and I shall give you mine .
ÉOMER: I would cut off your head , Dwarf , if it stood but a little higher from the ground .
LEGOLAS: You would die before your stroke fell !
ARAGORN: I am Aragorn , son of Arathorn . This is Gimli , son of Glóin and Legolas of the Woodland realm . We are friends of Rohan and of Théoden , your king .
ÉOMER: Théoden no longer recognizes friend from foe . Not even his own kin .
ARAGORN: We are not spies . We track a party of Uruk-hai westward across the plain . They ’ ve taken two of our friends captive .
ÉOMER: The Uruks are destroyed . We slaughtered them during the night .
GIMLI: But there were two hobbits . Did you see two hobbits with them ?
ARAGORN: They would be small – only children to your eyes .
ÉOMER: We left none alive . We piled the carcasses and burned them .
GIMLI: Dead ?
ÉOMER: I am sorry .
GIMLI: It ’ s one of their wee belts .
LEGOLAS: Hiro îth… ab 'wanath
ARAGORN: AAARRGGHH ! ! !
GIMLI: We failed them .
ARAGORN: A hobbit lay here , and the other . They crawled .
[FLASHBACK: Their hands freed , the hobbits run away from the battle scene , dodging unde a horse and trying to stay out of harms way . As they flee , Grishnákh grabs Pippin y his belt and clings on . ]
MERRY: The belt !
ARAGORN: The tracks lead away from the battle into Fangorn Forest .
GIMLI: Fangorn . What madness drove them in there ?
PIPPIN: Did we lose him ? I think we lost him .
GRISHNÁKH: I ’ m gon na rip out your filthy little innards ! Come here !
MERRY: Trees ! Climb a tree !
PIPPIN: Merry !
TREEBEARD: Hooooo
PIPPIN: Argh ! !
GRISHNÁKH: Let ’ s put a maggot-hole in your belly .
PIPPIN: Run , Merry !
TREEBEARD: Little Orcs ! Burárum
PIPPIN: It ’ s talking , Merry . The tree is talking !
TREEBEARD: Tree ? ! I am no tree . I am an Ent .
MERRY: A treeherder ! A shepherd of the forest .
PIPPIN: Don ’ t talk to it , Merry . Don ’ t encourage it .
TREEBEARD: Treebeard , some call me .
PIPPIN: And whose side are you on ?
TREEBEARD: Side ? I am on nobody ’ s side because nobody ’ s on my side , little Orc . Nobody cares for the woods anymore .
MERRY: We ’ re not Orcs . We ’ re Hobbits !
TREEBEARD: Hobbits ? Never heard of a hobbit before . Sounds like Orc mischief to me ! They come with fire , they come with axes . Gnawing , biting , breaking , hacking , urning ! Destroyers and usurpers , curse them !
MERRY: No , you don ’ t understand . We ’ re Hobbits Halflings ! Shirefolk !
TREEBEARD: Maybe you are and maybe you aren ’ t . The White Wizard will know .
PIPPIN: The White Wizard ?
MERRY: Saruman .
GOLLUM: See , see , we have led you out ! Hurry hobbitses hurry . Very lucky we find you .
SAM: Whoa , it ’ s a bog ! He ’ s led us into a swamp !
GOLLUM: A swamp , yes , yes . Come , master . We will take you on safe paths through the mist . Come , hobbits , come . We go quickly .
SAM: There are dead things ! Dead faces in the water !
GOLLUM: All dead . All rotten . Elves and men and orcses . A great battle long ago . The Dead Marshes . Yes , yes that is their name . This way . Don ’ t follow the lights .
SAM: Ohh !
GOLLUM: Careful now , or hobbits go down to join the dead ones and light little candles of their own .
SAM: Frodo !
FRODO: Gollum
GOLLUM: Don ’ t follow the lights !
SAM: Mr. Frodo ! Are you alright ?
[NIGHTFALL: Sam is asleep but Frodo is still awake . He is holding the Ring in the palm of his hand and stroking it , mesmerized . Suddenly he hears Gollum . ]
GOLLUM: Sooo bright . Sooo beautiful . our preciousss
FRODO: What did you say ?
GOLLUM: Master should be resting . Master needs to keep up his strength .
FRODO: Who are you ?
GOLLUM: Mustn ’ t ask us . Not its business . *Gollum , Gollum*
FRODO: Gandalf told me you were one of the River Folk .
GOLLUM: Cold be heart and hand and bone . Cold e travellers far from home .
FRODO: He said your life was a sad story .
GOLLUM: They do not see what lies ahead , when sun has failed and moon is dead .
FRODO: You were not so very different from a hobbit once , were you Sméagol ?
GOLLUM: What did you call me ?
FRODO: That was your name once , wasn ’ t it ? A long time ago .
GOLLUM: My name My name S SSméagol…
SAM: Black Riders !
GOLLUM: Hide ! Hide !
FRODO: Argh !
SAM: C ’ mon Frodo ! C'mon !
GOLLUM: Quick ! They will see us ! They will see us !
SAM: I thought they were dead !
GOLLUM: Dead ? No , you can not kill them . No .
SAM: Mr. Frodo ! It ’ s alright . I ’ m here .
GOLLUM: Hurry , hobbits . The Black Gate is very close .
GIMLI: Ptui ! Orc blood .
ARAGORN: These are strange tracks .
GIMLI: The air is so close in here .
LEGOLAS: This forest is old . Very old . Full of memory and anger .
ARAGORN: Gimli !
GIMLI: Huh ?
ARAGORN: Lower your axe .
GIMLI: Oh .
LEGOLAS: Aragorn , nad nâ ennas !
ARAGORN: Man cenich ?
LEGOLAS: The White Wizard approaches .
ARAGORN: Do not let him speak . He will put a spell on us .
WHITE WIZARD: You are tracking the footsteps of two young hobbits .
ARAGORN: Where are they ?
WHITE WIZARD: They passed this way the day before yesterday . They met someone they did not expect . Does that comfort you ?
ARAGORN: Who are you ? Show yourself !
GANDALF: Through fire and water . From the lowest dungeon to the highest peak , I fought with the Balrog of Morgoth .
ARAGORN: Gandalf !
GANDALF: Gandalf ? Yes That 's what they used to call me . Gandalf the Grey . That was my name .
GIMLI: Gandalf !
GANDALF: I am Gandalf the White . And I come ack to you now at the turn of the tide .
LEGOLAS: That is one of the Mearas , unless my eyes are cheated by some spell .
GANDALF: Shadowfax . He 's the lord of all horses and he 's een my friend through many dangers .
TREEBEARD: My home lies deep in the forest nea the roots of the mountain . I told Gandalf I would keep you safe and safe is where I ’ ll keep you . The trees have grown wild and dangerous . Anger festers in their hearts . They will harm you if they can . There are too few of us now . Too few of us Ents left to manage them .
GOLLUM: The Black Gate of Mordor .
SAM: Oh save us . My ol ' Gaffer 'd have a thing or two to say if he could see us now .
GOLLUM: Master says to show him the way into Mordor , so good Sméagol does . Maste says so .
FRODO: I did .
SAM: That ’ s it then . We can not get past that .
FRODO: Sam , no !
SAM: Argh ! !
GOLLUM: Master !
FRODO: I do not ask you to come with me , Sam .
SAM: I know , Mr Frodo . I doubt even these Elvish cloaks will hide us in there .
FRODO: Now !
GOLLUM: No ! No , no master ! They catch you ! They catch you ! Don ’ t take it to him ! He wants the preciousss . Always he ’ s looking for it ! And the preciousss is wanting to go back to him . But we mustn ’ t let him have it .
SAM: Why haven ’ t you spoken of this before ? !
GOLLUM: Because Master did not ask !
SAM: He ’ s up to something .
FRODO: Are you saying there ’ s another way into Mordor ?
GOLLUM: Yes . There is a path , and some stairs , and then… a tunnel .
FRODO: He ’ s led us this far , Sam .
SAM: Mr. Frodo , no .
FRODO: He ’ s been true to his word .
SAM: No !
FRODO: Lead the way , Sméagol .
GOLLUM: Good Sméagol always helps .
GANDALF: Edoras and the Golden Hall of Meduseld . There dwells Théoden , King of Rohan , whose mind is overthrown . Saruman ’ s hold over King Théoden is now very strong .
ÉOWYN: My lord , your son , he is dead . My lord ? Uncle ?
GANDALF: Be careful what you say . Do not look for welcome here .
GRÍMA: Oh , he… he must have died sometime in the night . What a tragedy for the king to lose his only son and heir .
ÉOWYN: Leave me alone , snake !
GRÍMA: Oh , but you are alone ! Who knows what you have spoken to the darkness . In bitter watches of the night , when all your life seems to shrink , the walls of your bower closing in about you , like a hutch to trammel some wild thing in .
ÉOWYN: Your words are poison !
GIMLI: You ’ ll find more cheer in a graveyard .
GANDALF: Ah .
HÁMA: I can not allow you before Théoden-King so armed , Gandalf Greyhame . By orde of Gríma Wormtongue .
GANDALF: Hmm ? Oh . You would not part an old man from his walking stick ?
GRÍMA: My lord , Gandalf the Grey is coming . He ’ s a herald of woe .
GANDALF: The courtesy of your hall is somewhat lessened of late , Théoden King .
GRÍMA: He ’ s not welcome .
THÉODEN: Why should I… welcome you , Gandalf… Stormcrow ?
GRÍMA: A just question , my liege . Late is the hour in which this conjurer chooses to appear . Lathspell spell I name him . Ill news is an ill guest .
GANDALF: Be silent ! Keep your forked tongue behind you teeth . I have not passed through fire and death to bandy crooked words with a witless worm !
GRÍMA: His staff ! I told you to take the wizard ’ s staff !
GANDALF: Théoden , son of Thengel , too long have you sat in the shadows .
GIMLI: I would stay still , if I were you .
GANDALF: Hearken to me ! I release you from the spell .
THÉODEN: Hahahhhahahahah ! You have no power here , Gandalf the Grey !
GANDALF: I will draw you , Saruman , as poison is drawn from a wound .
ARAGORN: Wait .
THÉODEN: If I go . . . Théoden dies .
GANDALF: You did not kill me , you will not kill him !
THÉODEN: Rohan is mine !
GANDALF: Be gone ! !
THÉODEN: I know you face . Éowyn… Éowyn .
GANDALF: Breathe the free air again , my friend .
THÉODEN: Dark have been my dreams of late .
GANDALF: Your fingers would remember their old strength better if they grasped you sword .
GRÍMA: Argh ! I 've only ever served you , my lord !
THÉODEN: Your leechcraft would have had me crawling on all fours like a beast !
GRÍMA: Send me not from your side .
ARAGORN: No , my lord ! No , my lord . Let him go . Enough blood has been spilled on his account .
GRÍMA: Get out of my way !
HÁMA: Hail , Théoden king !
THÉODEN: Where is Théodred ? Where is my son ?
GANDALF: Théodred ’ s death was not of your making .
THÉODEN: No parent should have to bury thei child .
GANDALF: He was strong in life . His spirit will find its way to the halls of your fathers . Westu hál . Ferðu , Théodred , Ferðu .
ÉOWYN: They had no warning . They were unarmed . Now the wildmen are moving through the Westfold , burning as they go . Rick , cot and tree .
FREDA: Where ’ s mama ?
ÉOWYN: Shh
GANDALF: This is but a taste of the terror that Saruman will unleash . All the more potent for he is driven now by fear of Sauron . Ride out and meet him head on . Draw him away from your women and children . You must fight .
ARAGORN: You have two thousand good men riding north as we speak . Éomer is loyal to you . His men will return and fight fo their king .
THÉODEN: They will be three hundred leagues from here by now . Éomer can not help us . I know what it is that you want of me . But I will not bring further death to my people . I will not risk open war .
ARAGORN: Open war is upon you . Whether you would isk it or not .
THÉODEN: When last I looked , Théoden , not Aragorn , was king of Rohan .
GANDALF: Then what is the king ’ s decision ?
HÁMA: By order of the king , the city must empty . We make for the refuge of Helm ’ s Deep . Do not burden yourselves with treasures . Take only what provisions you need .
GIMLI: Helm ’ s Deep ! They flee to the mountains when they should stand and fight . Who will defend them if not their king .
ARAGORN: He ’ s only doing what he thinks is best for his people . Helm ’ s Deep has saved them in the past .
GANDALF: There is no way out of that ravine . Théoden is walking into a trap . He thinks he ’ s leading them to safety . What they will get is a massacre . Théoden has a strong will but I fear for him . I fear for the survival of Rohan . He will need you before the end , Aragorn . The people of Rohan will need you . The defences HAVE to hold .
ARAGORN: They will hold .
GANDALF: The Grey Pilgrim that ’ s what they used to call me . Three hundred lives of men I ’ ve walked this earth and now I have no time . With luck , my search will not be in vain . Look to my coming at first light on the fifth day . At dawn , look to the East .
ARAGORN: Go .
ÉOWYN: Women of this country learned long ago Those without swords may still die upon them . I fear neither death nor pain .
ARAGORN: What do you fear , my lady ?
ÉOWYN: A cage . To stay behind bars until use and old age accept them and all chance of valor has gone beyond recall or desire .
ARAGORN: You are a daughter of kings , a shieldmaiden of Rohan . I do not think that would be your fate .
GRÍMA: Théoden will not stay at Edoras . It ’ s vulnerable , he knows this . He will expect an attack on the city . They will flee to Helm ’ s Deep , the great fortress of Rohan . It is a dangerous road to take through the mountains . They will be slow . They will have women and children with them .
SARUMAN: Send out your warg riders .
SAM: Hey Stinker ! Don ’ t go getting too fa ahead !
FRODO: Why do you do that ?
SAM: What ?
FRODO: Call him names ; run him down all the time .
SAM: Because… because that 's what he is , Mr. Frodo . There 's naught left in 'im ut lies and deceit . It 's the Ring he wants . It 's all he cares about .
FRODO: You have no idea what it did to him . What it ’ s still doing to him . I want to help him , Sam
SAM: Why ?
FRODO: Because I have to believe he can come ack .
SAM: You can ’ t save him , Mr. Frodo .
FRODO: What do you know about it ? Nothing !
SAM: I do . It 's the Ring . You ca n't take your eyes off it . I 've seen you . You 're not eating . You barely sleep . It 's taken a hold of you , Mr Frodo . You have to fight it !
FRODO: I know what I have to do Sam . The Ring was entrusted to me ! It 's my task ! Mine ! My own !
SAM: Can ’ t you hear yourself ? Don ’ t you know who you sound like ?
GOLLUM: We wants it . We needs it . Must have the precioussss . They stole it from us . Sneaky little hobbitsesss . Wicked , trickssssy , falssse !
SMÉAGOL: No ! Not Master .
GOLLUM: Yes , precious . False . They will cheat you , hurt you , lie .
SMÉAGOL: Master ’ s my friend .
GOLLUM: You don ’ t have any friends . Nobody likes YOU
SMÉAGOL: Not listening . I ’ m not listening .
GOLLUM: You ’ re a liar and a thief .
SMÉAGOL: Nope .
GOLLUM: Mur…derer… !
SMÉAGOL: Go away .
GOLLUM: Go away ! HAHAHAHA ! !
SMÉAGOL: I hate you . I hate you !
GOLLUM: Where would you be without me ? *Gollum , gollum* . I saved us . It was me . We survived because of me !
SMÉAGOL: Not anymore .
GOLLUM: What did you say ?
SMÉAGOL: Master looks after us now . We don ’ t need you .
GOLLUM: What ?
SMÉAGOL: Leave now and never come back .
GOLLUM: No ! !
SMÉAGOL: Leave now and never come back !
GOLLUM: Arrrgh ! ! !
SAM: You ’ ll make him sick , you will , behaving like that ! There ’ s only one way to eat a brace of coneys .
SMÉAGOL: Argh ! ! What ’ s it doing ! Stupid fat hobbit ! It ruins it !
SAM: What ’ s to ruin ? There ’ s hardly any meat on ‘ em .
GOLLUM: What ’ s taters , preciousss ? What ’ s taters uh ?
SAM: PO-TAY-TOES ! Boil ‘ em . Mash ‘ em . Stick ‘ em in a stew . Lovely big golden chips with a nice piece of fried fish .
SMÉAGOL: Pbbbttt ! !
SAM: Even you couldn ’ t say no to that .
SMÉAGOL: Oh yes we could ! Spoil nice fish Give it to usss rrraw and wrrriggling ! You keep nasty chips .
SAM: You ’ re hopeless .
GOLLUM: Wicked men . Servants of Sauron . They are called to Mordor . The Dark One is gathering all armies to him . It won ’ t e long now . He will soon be ready .
SAM: Ready to do what ?
GOLLUM: To make his war . The last war that will cover all the world in shadow .
FRODO: We ’ ve got to get moving . Come on , Sam .
SAM: Mr Frodo ! Look ! It ’ s an Oliphaunt !
FRODO: Sméagol ?
SAM: Ah !
FARAMIR: Bind their hands .
GIMLI: It ’ s true you don ’ t see many Dwarf women . And in fact , they are so alike in voice and appearance , haha that they ’ re often mistaken for Dwarf men .
ARAGORN: It ’ s the beards .
GIMLI: And this , in turn , has given rise to the belief that there are no Dwarf women . And that dwarves just spring out of holes in the ground !
ÉOWYN: Hahahaha ! !
GIMLI: Hehehe ! Which is of course ridiculous… Whoa ! !
ÉOWYN: Ooh !
GIMLI: It ’ s alright , it ’ s alright . Nobody panic . That was deliberate . It was deliberate .
[FLASHBACK: Aragorn is lying on a chaise in Rivendell . He opens his eyes and sees Arwen before him , smiling down at him . ]
ARAGORN: I am asleep . This is a dream .
ARWEN: Then it is a good dream . Sleep…
ARAGORN: Min lû pennich nin i aur hen telitha .
ARWEN: Ú i vethed nâ i onnad . Boe bedich go Frodo . Han âd lîn .
ARAGORN: Dolen i vâd o nin .
ARWEN: Si peliannen i vâd na dail lîn . Si boe ú-dhannathach .
ARAGORN: Arwen…
ARWEN: Ae ú-esteliach nad estelio han . Estelio ammen .
ÉOWYN: Where is she ? The woman who gave you that jewel .
ELROND: Our time here is ending . Arwen ’ s time is ending . Let her go . Let her take the ship into the west . Let her bea away her love for you to the Undying Lands . There it will be evergreen .
ARAGORN: But never more than a memory .
ELROND: I will not leave my daughter here to die .
ARAGORN: She stays because she still has hope .
ELROND: She stays for YOU ! She belongs with her people !
ARAGORN: Idhren emmen menna gui ethwel . Hae o auth a nîr a naeth .
ARWEN: Why are you saying this ?
ARAGORN: I am mortal ; you are Elfkind . It was a dream , Arwen , nothing more .
ARWEN: It was a gift . Keep it .
ÉOWYN: My lord ?
ARAGORN: She is sailing to the Undying Lands , with all that is left of her kin .
GAMLING: What is it ? Háma ?
HÁMA: I ’ m not sure .
GAMLING: Wargs !
LEGOLAS: Argh ! A scout !
THÉODEN: What is it ? What do you see ?
ARAGORN: Wargs ! We are under attack !
THÉODEN: All riders to the head of the column !
GIMLI: Come on , get me up here , I ’ m a rider ! Argh !
THÉODEN: You must lead the people to Helm ’ s Deep . And make haste !
ÉOWYN: I can fight !
THÉODEN: No ! You must do this for me .
GIMLI: Forward . I mean , charge forward ! March forward ! That ’ s it ! Go on !
ÉOWYN: Make for the lowe ground ! Stick together !
THÉODEN: CHARGE ! !
GIMLI: Bring your pretty face to my axe !
LEGOLAS: Aragorn !
GIMLI: Aragorn ?
SHARKU: He ’ s dead . Took a little tumble off the cliff .
LEGOLAS: You lie !
THÉODEN: Get the wounded on horses . The wolves of Isengard will return . Leave the dead .
REFUGEES: Helm ’ s Deep ! At last ! There it is !
OLD WOMAN: We ’ re safe , my lady ! Thank you !
FREDA: Mama !
MORWEN: Éothain ! Freda !
GAMLING: Make way for Théoden !
SOLDIERS: Sire !
GAMLING: Make way for the king !
ÉOWYN: So few . So few of you have returned .
THÉODEN: Our people are safe . We have paid for it with many lives .
GIMLI: My lady
ÉOWYN: Lord Aragorn , where is he ?
GIMLI: He fell
THÉODEN: Draw all our forces behind the wall . Bar the gate , and set a watch on the surround .
GAMLING: What of those who can not fight , my lord ? The women and children ?
THÉODEN: Get them into the caves . Saruman 's arm would have grown long indeed if he thinks he can reach us here .
GRÍMA: How ? How can fire undo stone ? What kind of device could bring down the wall ?
SARUMAN: If the wall is breached , Helm 's Deep will fall .
GRÍMA: Even if it is breached , it would take a number beyond reckoning , thousands to storm the keep .
SARUMAN: Tens of thousands .
GRÍMA: But , my lord , there is no such force .
SARUMAN: A new power is rising . Its victory is at hand !
PIPPIN: Look ! There ’ s smoke to the south !
TREEBEARD: There is always smoke rising from Isengard these days .
MERRY: Isengard ?
TREEBEARD: There was a time when Saruman would walk in my woods . But now he has a mind of metal and wheels . He no longer cares for growing things .
PIPPIN: What is it ?
MERRY: It ’ s Saruman ’ s army ! The war has started .
ARWEN: May the grace of the Valar protect you .
ARAGORN: Brego…
ELROND: Arwen .
ARWEN: I have made my choice .
ELROND: He is not coming back . Why do you linge here when there is no hope ?
ARWEN: There is still hope .
ELROND: If Aragorn survives this war , you will still be parted . If Sauron is defeated , and Aragorn made king and all that you hope for comes true , you will still have to taste the bitterness of mortality . Whether by the sword or the slow decay of time , Aragorn will die .
ARWEN: Gerich meleth nîn , ada .
GALADRIEL: I amar prestar aen han mathon ne nen , han mathon ne chae a han nostan ned gwilith . The power of the enemy is growing . Sauron will use his puppet Saruman to destroy the people of Rohan . Isengard has been unleashed . The eye of Sauron now turns to Gondor , the last free kingdom of men . His war on this country will come swiftly . He senses the Ring is close . The strength of the Ringbearer is failing . In his heart , Frodo begins to understand . The quest will claim his life . You know this . You have foreseen it . It is the risk we all took .
FARAMIR: What news ?
MADRIL: Our scouts report Saruman has attacked Rohan . Théoden ’ s people have fled to Helm ’ s Deep . But we must look to our own borders . Faramir , Orcs are on the move . Sauron is marshalling an army . Easterlings and Southrons are passing through the Black Gate .
FARAMIR: How many ?
MADRIL: Some thousands . More come every day .
FARAMIR: Who ’ s covering the river to the north ?
MADRIL: We pulled 500 men at Osgiliath , but if the city is attacked , we won ’ t hold it .
FARAMIR: Saruman attacks from Isengard . Sauron from Mordor . The fight will come to men on both fronts . Gondor is weak . Sauron will strike us soon . And he will strike hard . He knows now we do not have the strength to repel him .
SAM: Spies ? ! Now wait just a minute !
FARAMIR: Well if you ’ re not spies , then who are you ?
FRODO: We are hobbits of the Shire . Frodo Baggins is my name and this is Samwise Gamgee .
FARAMIR: Your bodyguard ?
SAM: His gardener .
FARAMIR: And where is your skulking friend ? That gangrel creature . He had an ill-favoured look .
FRODO: There was no other .
FARAMIR: You ’ re a friend of Boromir ?
FRODO: Yes for my part .
FARAMIR: It will grieve you then to learn that he is dead .
FRODO: Dead ? How ? When ?
FARAMIR: As one of his companions , I ’ d hoped you would tell me . He was my other .
GONDORIAN RANGER: Captain Faramir . We found the third one .
FARAMIR: You must come with me . Now .
GOLLUM: The rock and pool is nice and cool , so juicy sweet ! I only wish to catch a fish , so juicy sweet !
FRODO: Wait ! This creature is bound to me . And I to him . He is our guide . Please , let me go down to him .
GOLLUM: We must go now ?
FRODO: Sméagol , you must trust master . Follow me , come on . Come . Come , Sméagol . Nice Sméagol . That ’ s it . Come on .
GOLLUM: Master ! !
FARAMIR: Where are you leading them ? Answer me !
GOLLUM: Sméa…gol Why does it cry , Sméagol ?
SMÉAGOL: Cruel men hurts us . Maste trickst us .
GOLLUM: Of course he did . I told you he was tricksy . I told you he was false .
SMÉAGOL: Master is our friend ou friend .
GOLLUM: Master betrayed us .
SMÉAGOL: No , not its business . Leave us alone !
GOLLUM: Filthy little hobbitses . They stole it from us .
SMÉAGOL: No No !
FARAMIR: What did they steal ?
SAM: We have to get out of here . You go . Go , now ! You can do it . Use the Ring , Mr. Frodo . Just this once . Put it on . Disappear .
FRODO: I can ’ t . You were right , Sam . You tried to tell me , but… I ’ m sorry . The Ring ’ s taking me Sam . If I put it on , he ’ ll find me . He ’ ll see .
SAM: Mr. Frodo
FARAMIR: So this is the answer to all the riddles . Here in the wild I have you . Two halflings and a host of men at my call . The Ring of power within my grasp .
FRODO: No ! !
SAM: Stop it ! Leave him alone ! Don ’ t you understand ? He ’ s got to destroy it . That ’ s where we ’ re going . Into Mordor . To the mountain of fire .
DAMROD: Osgiliath is under attack . They call for reinforcements .
SAM: Please . It ’ s such a burden . Will you not help him ?
DAMROD: Captain ?
FARAMIR: Prepare to leave . The Ring will go to Gondor .
ARAGORN: Mae carnen , Brego , mellon nîn .
REFUGEES: He ’ s alive !
GIMLI: Where is he ? Where is he ? Get out of the way . I ’ m gon na kill him ! You are the luckiest , the canniest and the most reckless man I ever knew ! Bless you , laddie !
ARAGORN: Gimli , where is the king ?
LEGOLAS: Le ab-dollen . You look terrible .
ARAGORN: Hannon le .
THÉODEN: A great host , you say ?
ARAGORN: All Isengard is emptied
THÉODEN: How many ?
ARAGORN: Ten thousand strong at least .
THÉODEN: Ten thousand ? !
ARAGORN: It is an army bred for a single purpose to destroy the world of men . They will e here by nightfall .
THÉODEN: Let them come !
GIMLI: This is no rabble of mindless Orcs . These are Uruk-hai . Their armor is thick and their shields broad .
THÉODEN: I have fought many wars , Master Dwarf . I know how to defend my own keep .
ARAGORN: They do not come to destroy Rohan ’ s crops or villages . They come to destroy its people . Down to the last child .
THÉODEN: What would you have me do ? Look at my men . Thei courage hangs by a thread . If this is to be our end , then I would have them make such an end as to be worthy of emembrance .
ARAGORN: Send out riders , my lord . You must call for aid .
THÉODEN: And who will come ? Elves ? Dwarves ? We are not so lucky in our friends as you . The old alliances are dead .
ARAGORN: Gondor will answer .
THÉODEN: Gondor ? Where was Gondor when the Westfold fell ? Where was Gondor when our enemies closed in around us ? Where was Gon… – No , my lord Aragorn , we are alone . Get the women and children into the caves .
GAMLING: We need more time to lay provisions for a siege , lord –
THÉODEN: There is no time . War is upon us !
ROHAN CAPTAIN: Secure the gate !
TREEBEARD: We Ents have not troubled about the wars of men and wizards for a very long time . But now something is about to happen that has not happened for an age Ent Moot .
MERRY: What ’ s that ?
TREEBEARD: 'T is a gathering .
MERRY: A gathering of what ?
TREEBEARD: Beech , oak , chestnut , ash Good , good , good . Many have come . Now we must decide if the Ents will go to war .
SOLDIER 1: Move back ! Move to the caves !
SOLDIER 2: Keep moving !
SOLDIER 3: Quickly now !
ARAGORN: Farmer , farriers , stable boys . These are no soldiers .
GIMLI: Most have seen too many winters .
LEGOLAS: Or too few . Look at them . They ’ re frightened . I can see it in their eyes . Boe a hûn neled herain dan caer menig !
ARAGORN: Si beriathar hýn . Amar nâ ned Edoras .
LEGOLAS: Aragorn , men i ndagor . Hýn ú- ortheri . Natha daged aen !
ARAGORN: Then I shall die as one them !
GIMLI: Let him go , lad . Let him be .
GAMLING: Every villager able to wield a sword has been sent to the armory . My lord ?
THÉODEN: Who am I , Gamling ?
GAMLING: You are our king , sire .
THÉODEN: And do you trust your king ?
GAMLING: Your men , my lord , will follow you to whateve end .
THÉODEN: To whatever end… Where is the horse and the rider ? Where is the horn that was blowing ? They have passed like rain on the mountains . Like wind in the meadow . The days have gone down in the west . Behind the hills , into shadow . How did it come to this ?
ARAGORN: Give me your sword . What is your name ?
HALETH: Haleth , son of Háma , my lord . The men are saying that we will not live out the night . They say that it is hopeless..
ARAGORN: This is a good sword , Haleth , son of Háma .
LEGOLAS: We have trusted you this far . You have not led us astray . Forgive me . I was wrong to despair .
ARAGORN: Ú-moe edhored , Legolas .
GIMLI: If we had more time I ’ d get this adjusted . It ’ s a little tight across the chest .
LEGOLAS: That is no Orc horn .
BEREG: Send for the king . Open the gate !
SOLDIER: Open the gate !
THÉODEN: How is this possible ?
HALDIR: I bring word from Elrond of Rivendell . An alliance once existed between Elves and men . Long ago we fought and died together . We come to honor that allegiance .
ARAGORN: Mae govannen , Haldir .
HALDIR: We are proud to fight alongside men , once more .
GIMLI: You could have picked a bette spot .
LEGOLAS: Your friends are with you , Aragorn .
GIMLI: Let ’ s hope they last the night .
ARAGORN: A Eruchîn , ú-dano i faelas a hyn an uben tanatha le faelas !
GIMLI: What ’ s happening out there ?
LEGOLAS: Shall I describe it to you ? Or would you like me to find you a box ?
GIMLI: Hehehehe ! !
ARAGORN: Dartho !
THÉODEN: So it begins .
ARAGORN: Tangado halad !
LEGOLAS: Faeg i-varv dîn na lanc a nu ranc .
ARAGORN: Leithio i philinn !
GIMLI: Did they hit anything ?
THÉODEN: Give them a volley .
GAMLING: Fire !
ARAGORN: Fire !
GIMLI: Send them to me ! C ’ mon !
ARAGORN: Pendraid !
GIMLI: Good !
LEGOLAS: I ’ m on seventeen !
GIMLI: Argh ! I ’ ll have no pointy-ea outscoring me !
LEGOLAS: Nineteen !
PIPPIN: Merry !
TREEBEARD: We have just agreed .
MERRY: Yes ?
TREEBEARD: I have told your names to the Ent moot and we have agreed – you are not Orcs .
PIPPIN: Well , that ’ s good news .
MERRY: And what about Saruman ? Have you come to a decision about HIM ?
TREEBEARD: Now don ’ t be hasty , Master Meriadoc .
MERRY: Hasty ? Our friends are out there ! They need our help ! They can not fight this war on their own .
TREEBEARD: War , yes… It affects us all . But you must understand , young hobbit . It takes a loong time to say anything in ooold… Entish . And we neve say anything… unless it is worth taking a looong… time to say .
GIMLI: Seventeen ! Eighteen ! Nineteen ! Twenty ! Twenty-one ! Twenty-two !
ARAGORN: Na fennas !
THÉODEN: Is this it ? Is this all you can conjure , Saruman ?
ARAGORN: Togo hon dad , Legolas ! Dago hon ! Dago hon !
THÉODEN: Brace the Gate ! Hold them ! Stand firm !
GIMLI: Aragorn ! ! Argh !
ARAGORN: Gimli ! Hado i philinn !
TREEBEARD: The Ents can not hold back this storm . We must weather such things as we have always done .
MERRY: How can that be your decision ? !
TREEBEARD: This is not our war .
MERRY: But you 're part of this world ! Aren ’ t you ? ! You must help , please ! You must do something !
TREEBEARD: You are young and brave , Master Merry . But your part in this tale is over . Go back to your home .
PIPPIN: Maybe Treebeard ’ s right . We don ’ t belong here , Merry . It 's too big for us . What can we do in the end ? We 've got the Shire . Maybe we should go home .
MERRY: The fires of Isengard will spread . And the woods of Tuckborough and Buckland will burn . And all that was once green and good in this world will be gone . There wo n't be a Shire , Pippin .
GAMLING: Aragorn ! Fall back to the Keep ! Get your men out of there !
ARAGORN: Na Barad ! Na Baraad ! Haldir , na Barad !
GIMLI: What are you doing ? Argh ! What are you stopping for !
ARAGORN: HALDIR ! !
GAMLING: Brace the gate !
SOLDIER: Hold them !
THÉODEN: To the gate ! Draw your swords !
GAMLING: Make way ! We can not hold much longer .
THÉODEN: Hold them !
ARAGORN: How long do you need ?
GAMLING: Brace the gate !
THÉODEN: As long as you can give me !
ARAGORN: Gimli !
THEODEN: Timbers ! Brace the Gate !
GIMLI: Come on ! We can take ‘ em !
ARAGORN: It ’ s a long way .
GIMLI: Toss me .
ARAGORN: What ?
GIMLI: I can not jump the distance ! You ’ ll have to toss me !
ARAGORN: Not a word .
THÉODEN: Shore up the door !
SOLDIER 1: Make way !
SOLDIER 2: Follow me to the barricade .
SOLDIER 3: Watch our backs !
SOLDIER 4: Throw another one over here !
THÉODEN: Higher !
SOLDIER: Hold fast the gate ! ]
THÉODEN: Gimli ! Aragorn ! Get out of there !
LEGOLAS: Aragorn !
THÉODEN: Pull everybody back ! Pull them back !
GAMLING: Fall back ! Fall back !
THÉODEN: They ’ ve broken through ! The castle is eached . Retreat !
GAMLING: Fall back !
THÉODEN: Retreat !
ARAGORN: Hurry ! Inside ! Get them inside !
GAMLING: Into the Keep !
TREEBEARD: I will leave you at the western borders of the forest . You can make your way north to your homeland from there .
PIPPIN: Wait ! Stop ! Stop ! Turn around . Turn around . Take us south !
TREEBEARD: South ? But that will lead you past Isengard .
PIPPIN: Yes . Exactly . If we go south we can slip past Saruman unnoticed . The close we are to danger , the farther we are from harm . It ’ s the last thing he ’ ll expect .
TREEBEARD: Mmmm . That doesn ’ t make sense to me . But then , you are very small . Perhaps you ’ re right . South it is then . Hold on , little Shirelings . I always like going south . Somehow it feels like going down hill .
MERRY: Are you mad ? We ’ ll be caught !
PIPPIN: No we won ’ t . Not this time .
RANGER 1: Look ! Osgiliath burns !
RANGER 2: Mordor has come .
FRODO: The Ring will not save Gondor . It has only the powe to destroy . Please , let me go .
FARAMIR: Hurry .
FRODO: Faramir , you must let me go !
TREEBEARD: And a little family of field mice that climb up sometimes and they tickle me awfully . They ’ re always trying to get somewhere where they – Oh ! ! Many of these trees were my friends . Creatures I had known from nut and acorn .
PIPPIN: I ’ m sorry , Treebeard .
TREEBEARD: They had voices of their own . Saruman ! A wizard should know better !
MERRY: Yes !
TREEBEARD: Hoorarooom Come my friends . The Ents are going to war . It is likely that we go to our doom . Last march of the Ents !
MADRIL: Faramir , Orcs have taken the eastern shore . Their numbers are too great . By nightfall we ’ ll be overrun .
SAM: Mr Frodo !
FRODO: It ’ s calling to him , Sam . His eye is almost on me .
SAM: Hold on , Mr. Frodo… You 'll be alright
FARAMIR: Take them to my father . Tell him Farami sends a mighty gift . A weapon that will change our fortunes in this war .
SAM: Do you want to know what happened to Boromir ? You want to know why your brothe died ? He tried to take the Ring from Frodo ! After swearing an oath to protect him , he tried to kill him ! The Ring drove your brother mad !
RANGER: Watch out !
SAM: Mr Frodo ?
FRODO: They ’ re here . They ’ ve come .
FARAMIR: NAZGÛL ! ! Stay here . Keep out of sight . Take cover !
THÉODEN: The fortress is taken . It is over .
ARAGORN: You said this fortress would never fall while you men defend it ! They still defend it ! They have died defending it !
WOMAN: They are breaking in !
ARAGORN: Is there no other way for the women and children to get out of the caves ? Is there no othe way ?
GAMLING: There is one passage . It leads into the mountains . But they will not get far . The Uruk-hai are too many .
ARAGORN: Send word for the women and children to make for the mountain pass . And barricade the entrance .
THÉODEN: So much death . What can men do against such reckless hate ?
ARAGORN: Ride out with me . Ride out and meet them .
THÉODEN: For death and glory .
ARAGORN: For Rohan . For your people .
GIMLI: The sun is rising .
THÉODEN: Yes . Yes ! The horn of Helm Hammerhand shall sound in the deep one last time !
GIMLI: Yes !
THÉODEN: Let this be the hour when we draw swords together . Fell deeds awake . Now fo wrath ! Now for ruin ! And a red dawn !
ARAGORN: Gandalf .
GANDALF: Théoden king stands alone .
ÉOMER: Not alone . Rohirrim ! !
THÉODEN: Éomer !
ÉOMER: To the king !
PIPPIN: Yes !
TREEBEARD: A hit . A fine hit !
MERRY: Pippin , hold on !
TREEBEARD: Hold on , little hobbits !
SAM: What are you doing ? Where are you going ? !
[SLOW MOTION: Frodo walks up some stairs and stands on a bridge . A Nazgûl on a Fell beast emerges in front of him . Frodo stares at the Nazgûl , fixated . Feeling the call of the Ring , he holds it up . Farami watches the unfolding tableau from below . As Frodo moves to put the Ring on his finger and the Nazgûl flies closer and closer , Sam runs up and knocks Frodo over . Faramir releases an arrow and shoots the Fell Beast . Frodo and Sam oll down the stairs . As they come to a stop at the bottom , Frodo holds Sam in a death grip , yells and points Sting at his throat , his eyes livid with madness and anger that someone would try to take the Ring away . ]
FRODO: Aaarrgghh ! ! !
SAM: It ’ s me . It ’ s your Sam . Don ’ t you know you Sam ?
FRODO: I can ’ t do this , Sam .
SAM: I know . It ’ s all wrong . By rights we shouldn ’ t even be here . But we are . It ’ s like in the great stories , Mr. Frodo . The ones that really mattered . Full of darkness and danger they were . And sometimes you didn ’ t want to know the end . Because how could the end be happy ? How could the world go back to the way it was when so much bad had happened ?
THÉODEN: Victory ! We have victory !
SAM: But in the end , it ’ s only a passing thing , this shadow . Even darkness must pass . A new day will come . And when the sun shines it will shine out the clearer . Those were the stories that stayed with you . That meant something , even if you were too small to understand why . But I think , Mr. Frodo , I do understand . I know now . Folk in those stories had lots of chances of turning back only they didn ’ t . They kept going because they were holding on to something .
FRODO: What are we holding on to , Sam ?
SAM: There ’ s some good in this world , Mr. Frodo . And it ’ s worth fighting for .
FARAMIR: I think at last we understand one another , Frodo Baggins .
MADRIL: You know the laws of our country , the laws of your father . If you let them go , your life will be forfeit .
FARAMIR: Then it is forfeit . Release them .
GANDALF: Sauron ’ s wrath will be terrible , his etribution swift . The battle for Helm ’ s Deep is over . The battle for Middle-earth is about to begin . All our hopes now lie with two little hobbits . Somewhere in the wilderness .
SAM: I wonder if we ’ ll ever be put into songs or tales .
FRODO: What ?
SAM: I wonder if people will ever say , ‘ let ’ s hear about Frodo and the Ring. ’ And they ’ ll say ‘ yes , that ’ s one of my favorite stories . Frodo was really courageous , wasn ’ t he , dad. ’ ‘ Yes , my boy , the most famousest of hobbits . And that ’ s saying alot . ’
FRODO: Huh , you left out one of the chief characters – Samwise the Brave . I want to hea more about Sam .
SAM: Now Mr. Frodo , you shouldn ’ t make fun . I was being serious .
FRODO: So was I .
SAM: Samwise the Brave .
FRODO: Sméagol !
SAM: We ’ re not gon na wait for you . Come on !
SMÉAGOL: Master Master looks after us . Maste wouldn ’ t hurt us .
GOLLUM: Master broke his promise .
SMÉAGOL: Don ’ t ask Sméagol . Poor , poor Sméagol .
GOLLUM: Master betrayed us ! Wicked , tricksy , false . We ought to wring his filthy little neck . Kill him ! Kill him ! Kill them oth . And then we take the precious and we be the master .
SMÉAGOL: The fat hobbit , he knows . Eyes always watching .
GOLLUM: Then we stabs them out . Put out his eyeses . And make HIM crawl .
SMÉAGOL: Yes ! Yes ! Yes !
GOLLUM: Kill them both .
SMÉAGOL: Yes ! No no ! It ’ s too risky , it ’ s too risky .
SAM: Where ’ s he gone ? Hey Gollum , where are you ?
FRODO: Sméagol ?
GOLLUM: We could let HER do it .
SMÉAGOL: Yes . She could do it .
GOLLUM: Yes , precious she could . And then we takes it once they ’ re dead .
SMÉAGOL: Once they ’ re dead…
GOLLUM: Shh…
SMÉAGOL: Come on , hobbits . Long ways to go yet . Sméagol will show you the way .
GOLLUM: Follow me .
YURI: There are over 550 million firearms in worldwide circulation . That 's one firearm for every twelve people on the planet . The only question is how do we arm the other eleven ?
UKRAINIAN OFFICER: Call it `` agricultural machinery '' .
YURI: All property is theft .
RADIO ANNOUNCER: Finally , in response to human rights protests and in an effort to encourage the United States to sell grain to the Soviet Union after two successive crop failures , it is reported that the politburo has consented to permit a limited number of Jews to emigrate from the Soviet Union to Israel . And that concludes this edition of news from the BBC World Service .
ANATOLY: Trading Jews for grain .
VITALY: It 's good P.R . - for the Moscow Olympics .
IRINA: Good for the Jews .
YURI: And us . All eyes to Yuri , family confused . YURI We 're Jewish .

ANATOLY: Mazeltov .
IRINA: You 're not Jewish .
ANATOLY: I like it . I like the hat - to remind us there 's something above us . I like that . Anatoly dons his hat . ANATOLY I 'm going to temple .
IRINA: You 're not going to temple . You go to temple more than the rabbi !
U.N. ENVOY: With all due respect , Mr. Baptiste , you do n't seriously expect us to believe that this represents your entire arsenal . Baptiste shrugs . U.N . ENVOY This is making a nonsense of the embargo atified by all five permanent members of the Security Council . The escalation in the uild up of arms jeopardizes not only orde in the region but ultimately world order . Baptiste smiles .
BAPTISTE: World order ? You say we jeopardize world order ? Baptiste 's Third Wife wipes his brow . BAPTISTE Your idea of world order is when you 're giving the orders to the world . The Envoy has no response .
YURI: Orders . They reach the door marked , `` MEN '' .
BAPTISTE: This is what they mean by U.N. Observer ? Yuri winces at the remark .
YURI: Does n't look like a job for two men .
BAPTISTE: You know you are fighting a losing battle , my young friend . War is nature . If you take away the guns , we will kill each othe with knives . Take away the knives , we will kill each other with sticks . Take away the sticks , we will kill each other with you peace treaties . You can not stop this bath of blood .
YURI: It 's not `` bath of blood '' . It 's , `` blood ath '' .
BAPTISTE: Thank you . But I like it my way .
U.N. PEACEKEEPERS: Take it off , baby ! Take it off ! Ava steps up to the microphone .
AVA: Baby blue . My favorite color ! A roar of approval from the men . AVA I suppose I could give you the speech about `` my hope for world peace '' but I have a feeling you do n't want to hear that today .
U.N. PEACEKEEPER: My hope is for a piece of your ass ! They roar again .
AVA: I do n't know if you 'll be taking me to bed tonight , darling , but you can take her .
U.N. PEACEKEEPER: Ava ! Ava !
MANAGER: Do n't touch what you ca n't afford .
U.N. PEACEKEEPER: Let 's get drunk .
MONROVIAN GIRL: What 's this ?
YURI: For the smile .
LIBERIAN MAN: Glock .45 .
YURI: What ? Yuri stares at the money , bewildered .
LIBERIAN MAN: President Jackson . He shakes his head .
YURI: No .
LIBERIAN MAN: You are driving a hard bargain . He hands Yuri a second twenty .
YURI: No , keep it . Keep the money . Keep the gun .
LIBERIAN MAN: What do you take me for - a thief ?
YURI: You want more Glocks ?
LIBERIAN MAN: And the Heckler & Koch G-3 assault rifle .
YURI: What makes you think I 'll do that ?
LIBERIAN MAN: I will come back and shoot you with the Glock . By the way , do you have the hollow point cartridges ? Yuri stares at the man .
YURI: You got any color preference for that ?
LIBERIAN MAN: Kelly green . I will find you .
VIVIAN: What are we doing here , Yuri ?
YURI: Whatever you want .
VIVIAN: You know what I mean . Here , in this country . Are we doing any good ?
YURI: Would nothing be better ?
IRINA: Who are you ? You 're not my son . My son does n't own such a suit . Yuri flashes his killer smile in response .
YURI: You know who 's going to inherit the earth ? Vitaly looks at him blankly . YURI Arms dealers - because everybody else is too usy killing each other .
VITALY: It 's a hell of a fucking career move .
YURI: That 's the point . I 've seen how the world 's coming apart .
VITALY: And you want to help with that ?
YURI: You ca n't stop it . It 's a basic human need - we eat , sleep , sleep with each other and what else ? Fight . The oldest human skeletons have spearheads in their rib cages . Vitaly is still skeptical .
VITALY: What do you know about guns ?
YURI: I know which end I 'd rather be on . Every day there are people shooting at each other . I think to myself , what guns are they using ? Why not mine ?
VITALY: I do n't know .
YURI: Vitaly , I 've tasted your borscht , you 're no fucking chef . I can eat here for free and I still do n't eat here . You 're doing nothing with your life .
VITALY: Maybe doing nothing 's better than doing this . Yuri , I 've actually fired one of these things .
YURI: That 's why I need you . Brothers in arms . Vitaly smiles , looks sold .
ANATOLY: Finally getting in touch with what 's important , my Son ?
YURI: Yes .
ASIAN BUSINESSMAN: I can get you the shoulder-fired SA-7 surface-to-air missiles . The older Chinese model . Not so effective against modern military aircraft but deadly if used against a commercial airliner . I 'm giving them away at eight-fifty .
VITALY: They 're talking . Zaharoff , irritated , nonetheless humors Yuri .
SIMEON: May I help you ?
YURI: A mutual friend , Eli Kurtzman from Brighton Beach Import-Export said to contact you . I have a business proposal . Perhaps we can discuss it - over a drink . Simeon looks him up and down .
SIMEON: You 're in the wrong place my young friend . This is no place for amateurs .
YURI: Yob tvayu mat .
VITALY: What do we do , go more legitimate ?
YURI: No . More illegal . Vitaly nods thoughtfully .
VITALY: What I 'd give right now for a plate of red cabbage and potatoes . The wall explodes with gunfire .
YURI: It 's not our fight . Vitaly 's eyes well with tears .
INDIAN COMMANDER: We 're making terrific progress - most casualties from avalanches and frostbite .
CANNIBAL: Cease fire , man . Cease fire . It 's over .
YURI: What ? ! What do you mean it 's over ?
CANNIBAL: Truce . We 're friends , man .
YURI: Friends ? ! You ca n't be fucking friends . Last week I spoke to you on the phone . You said you would not rest until every last ebel was dead . You called them vermin . You said would piss in their mouths , you said you would exterminate them like cockroaches . Just last week , you said this !
CANNIBAL: That was last week , man . Cannibal starts to walk away .
YURI: Cannibal , do n't you fucking walk away from me ! Cannibal flashes Yuri a peace sign .
CANNIBAL: Peace , man !
YURI: Fuck you , Cannibal ! ! Yuri looks to Vitaly .
VITALY: Maybe we can offload it - the Balkans .
YURI: At least when they say they 're going to have a war , they keep their word .
AFGHANI OFFICIAL: I hope you 're not thinking of selling these , Mr. Orlov .
YURI: Personal use .
AFGHANI OFFICIAL: There 's a hundred thousand bullets here .
YURI: I 'm kind of trigger happy .
CAPTAIN: Do we run ?
VITALY: We have to get out of here .
YURI: No , no-one 's going anywhere . Slowdead slow . Buy me time .
VITALY: I 've got Belgium .
YURI: What the fuck use is that ? ! He 's painting a name registered in the fucking Netherlands ! Vitaly winces . YURI You got France ? !
VITALY: Yes , why ?
YURI: Turn it on its side .
VALENTINE: Not exactly `` The Love Boat '' . Another AGENT hands him a phone . VALENTINE It 's clean ? It does n't look clean . I 'm oarding .
YURI: It 's Yuri . Phone in a sighting of the Kristol south of Aruba .
AGENT: Sir , sighting of the Kristol due north . Valentine hesitates , returns to the ladder .
YURI: Nice job .
NARC LEADER: You 're late .
VITALY: Hey , fuck you !
NARC LEADER: Fuck you ! Yuri tries to play peacemaker .
YURI: No , you do n't fuck him
NARC LEADER: I apologize for earlier .
YURI: I understand .
NARC LEADER: It 's all there .
YURI: What is this ?
NARC LEADER: Six keys of pure .
YURI: I ca n't hand this to my fucking bank telle at Chase Manhattan .
NARC LEADER: You should be thanking me . Have you checked the street price today ? With the seizures at the border last week , it 's jumped thirty percent .
YURI: I sell guns . I do n't sell drugs .
NARC LEADER: Diversify . The Narc Leader walks away .
YURI: I 've got standards .
VITALY: Now what ?
YURI: Vit .
VITALY: Yuri ! It 's my brother , Yuri . He 's my big brother . Yuri stares at the cocaine map .
YURI: What the fuck is that ?
VITALY: Ukraine . I start in Odessa , work my way to the Crimea
YURI: You 'll be fucking dead before you reach Kiev .
VITALY: You fuck !
YURI: Get out of the car . Vitaly does n't budge . YURI I promised our parents .
VITALY: Please .
YURI: Vitaly , you 're going to have a good time . This is a top place . Two Ford models checked in last week and that cute weathe girl 's been here since July .
VITALY: Please .
AGENT: There 's really no one else you 'd consider ? Christie and Brooke are both availablenot the right look ? It 's just that Ava does n't generally do print .
YURI: The product ? Er , Colt .45 . The beer .
AVA: Popular hotel , huh ? Yuri smiles . Ava approaches , extends a hand . AVA Ava Cordova .
YURI: Yuri Orlov . What brings you to St. Barts ?
AVA: A photo shoot . At least , that was the plan . But the photographer 's plane got stuck in Miami . Hurricane - though there was nothing in the news .
YURI: Those things can come out of nowhere .
AVA: The job 's cancelled and there 's no flight ack to New York 'til Tuesday . Yuri pretends to ponder her predicament .
YURI: You can hitch a ride with me if you like .
AVA: This is your plane ?
YURI: That is my name . They enter the plane .
AVA: Do n't apologize . I put on clothes for a living .
YURI: At least you are n't taking them off .
AVA: I would be if half the photographers had their way . But I ca n't complain . I 'm paid to say , `` Cheese '' . What about you ?
YURI: Nothing so glamorous . I 'm in transport - international air freight mostly .
AVA: What , like UPS or something ?
YURI: Something like that .
AVA: Business is good .
YURI: Like you , I ca n't complain . They both drink . A thought occurs to Ava .
AVA: But if you did ?
YURI: WellI do n't know . It 's just that I travel all around the world ut I ca n't help feeling sometimes that I 'm going nowhere .
AVA: This is no accident , is it , Yuri ? Yuri freezes - does n't answer . AVA It feels like fate .
YURI: I do n't believe in fate .
AVA: What do you believe in ?
YURI: It 's traditional .
VITALY: Traditional . The guests nod , uncertain . YURI One more time , Vitaly . Vitaly lets go another burst . YURI I 'm sorry . I should have said something .
ANATOLY: Always remember , son , there 's something above you .
YURI: Sure , Dad . A forty-thousand dollar crystal chandelier .
IRINA: You need this . Irina takes Anatoly 's arm , they walk away .
ANATOLY: Jesus was Jewish . You 're worshipping a Jew .
IRINA: Ava , this is too much .
AVA: Yuri likes to spoil you . Nicolai crawls an inch . AVA beams proudly .
ANATOLY: That 's my grandson . Ava looks around for Yuri .
AVA: Yuri . Do n't you want to see what your son is doing ?
ANATOLY: What the hell 's the matter ?
YURI: It 's over ! It 's over !
AVA: What 's over ?
YURI: The Cold War , the Soviet Union , the Evil Empire . Mikhail 's saying `` no mas '' . He 's throwing in the towel . It 's over .
AVA: That 's nice . Your son is crawling .
ANATOLY: At least there 'll be religious freedom .
YURI: I think I 'll go back for a visit . Do you stay in touch with Uncle Dmitri ?
ANATOLY: Dmitri Volkoff ? Now and then .
YURI: How is he ?
ANATOLY: The luckiest man alive . You know he was one of the first men at Chernobyl . Off-duty , at his daughter 's wedding , he was roaring drunk . He was the only one who survived . Later they found that alcohol in your blood esists radiation .
YURI: He 's still a General in the army ?
ANATOLY: Major General . He got promoted . Two of his ivals were also there that day . I told you - he 's the luckiest man alive .
YURI: He may be luckier than you think .
YURI: You 're only remembered when you 're dead .
ANATOLY: It 's not kosher .
VITALY: Merry fucking Christmas !
ANATOLY: Vitaly , who is this ?
ANGEL: Angel .
VITALY: Her name really is Angel . She 's a fairy . Let 's stick her on top of the Christmas tree . Vitaly and Angel laugh . No one else does .
YURI: I 'm going back to Ukraine . Vitaly snorts it off the dash .
VITALY: I miss Odessa . I miss you .
YURI: I miss you too . Vitaly kisses Yuri . VITALY Be careful , Yuri . Those things you sell , kill inside .
BORDER GUARD: Visa ?
YURI: It 's good to be home .
DMITRI: Nephew , come here and hug the luckiest man alive .
YURI: 0 - 60 in 4.8 . Dmitri is impressed .
DMITRI: I ca n't just sell you government property , Yuri . I have to report
YURI: Report to who ? Moscow ? As of last week Moscow is in a foreign country .
DMITRI: New flag , new boss .
YURI: There is no new boss yet . They 're too busy squabbling over who gets the presidential holiday home at the Black Sea . Dmitri ca n't deny it . YURI It 's beautiful . The ones who know do n't care any more . The ones who care do n't know . Show me your inventory .
YURI: Is that a `` 4 '' ? It does n't look like a `` 4 '' to me . It looks more like a `` 1 '' .
DMITRI: No , it 's a `` 4 '' .
YURI: It 's whatever we say it is because no one else knows the difference .
DMITRI: Someone will work this out , Yuri . What happens then ?
YURI: We 'll cut them in . Anyway , what could happen - you 're the luckiest man alive .
SIMEON: Do you know who the fuck I am ?
OFFICER: Who the fuck cares who the fuck you are ?
SIMEON: I demand to see your commanding officer .
OFFICER: You do n't demand shit . Simeon reconsiders his position .
SIMEON: Just give me back my papers .
OFFICER: What papers ?
BARMAID: You sell guns ?
YURI: Maybe you 'd like to come to my room and see my bazooka . The Barmaid giggles and exits .
SIMEON: I am here , are n't I ?
YURI: Not all of you , I think . Simeon 's look begs explanation . YURI You 've gotten so rich selling for the CIA , you ca n't get that ideology completely out of your head . The empire was evil for too long . Simeon shrugs .
SIMEON: I ca n't deny , it takes some getting used to . Last week we were trying to beat thei ains in and now we 're going into business together .
YURI: There 's no place in gunrunning for politics anymore , Simeon . I sell to leftists , ightists . I 'd sell to pacifists but they 're not the most regular of customers . Yuri leans forward . YURI Of course , you 're not a true internationalist
SIMEON: I understand you have Ukraine in your pocket ut there are the other satellite states . Bulgaria , Hungary , Poland , Belarus . Instead of cutting each other 's throats , it may be more profitable to work together . What do you think ?
YURI: I think you are the amateur now . I think you suffer from a philosophical disadvantage - you have a philosophy . I think you should go with your instincts - your first instinct . Simeon is confused . YURI I am the same man who was not good enough for you before . I am not good enough fo you now . Simeon blanches . Yuri gets up . Simeon holds his rival 's arm .
SIMEON: The problem with gunrunners going to war is there 's no shortage of ammunition . Yuri departs .
UKRAINE MAJOR: I 'll tell you what I 'll do . Buy six , you get one free .
YURI: What about tech support ?
UKRAINE MAJOR: No problem .
YURI: Son , get off there before you get hurt .
UKRAINE MAJOR: He 's the tech support .
YURI: He 's twelve .
UKRAINE MAJOR: Thirteen . Almost fourteen .
DMITRI: Kids grow up fast around here .
UKRAINE MAJOR: He can take it apart in his sleep . Yuri shrugs , shakes the Major 's hand .
DMITRI: How can I ? You keep selling my helicopters . You 're too greedy , Yuri .
YURI: We have to go back .
DMITRI: We 'll be going in reverse . We ca n't turn around for a mile . The YOUNG SOLDIER on lookout calls to them .
YOUNG SOLDIER: They 're coming .
DMITRI: We shoot it out ?
YURI: And start an international fucking incident - no , no , no .
DMITRI: So we run .
YURI: No . I 've got paperwork .
DMITRI: Not for the gunship . Yuri , you know the penalty for sanction-busting - selling a military helicopter ?
YURI: It 's not a military helicopter . It 's a escue helicopter .
VALENTINE: Papers .
VALENTINE: The end-user certificate for this aircraft states Burkina Faso . Nice . Did you type it yourself ?
YURI: It 's for humanitarian missions .
VALENTINE: You 're a humanitarian ? Yuri shrugs - why not ? VALENTINE This is a killing machine .
YURI: Not any more .
DMITRI: Listen to the nephew .
YURI: Did n't you get the memo ? The war 's over . What can they do with military hardware but convert to civilian use ?
DMITRI: What , yes ?
YURI: The only way you could die from this baby is if a food drop hits you .
VALENTINE: Also going to Burkina Faso ?
YURI: But to a different client at a different address .
VALENTINE: What do you take me for ? A complete fucking fool ?
YURI: Not complete , Sir . And while I hesitate to tell you your job , I must point out that when shipped separately the weapons and the aircraft both comply with the current Interpol trade standards and practices .
VALENTINE: You expect me to believe this is a coincidence ?
YURI: I can see how certain people might interpret it as suspicious but thank God we live in a world where suspicion alone does not constitute a crime .
VALENTINE: Yuri Orlov . You and I are going to be seeing a lot of each other .
YURI: I can hardly wait .
VALENTINE: Watch out for the time you do n't see me .
BOY: What an asshole .
YURI: What was he doing here ?
DMITRI: Trying to beat your offer . I sent him on his way . He does n't understand the concept of loyalty .
YURI: Do n't worry . There 're more VCR 's . I left them in your new car .
DMITRI: Even your enemy was admiring that car . I am the luckiest man alive .
YURI: Dmit ! ! !
AVA: Yes , I 'll accept the charges .
YURI: Ava
AVA: Hey , baby . You forgotten what time it is ?
YURI: Sorry . I , er How was your audition ?
AVA: They 're going in another direction . The direction of someone who can act .
YURI: Do n't say that . You 're good .
AVA: And you 're biased .
YURI: Rough day at the office .
AVA: Come home . We miss you .
YURI: Soon . How 's Nicki ?
AVA: Asleep in our bed . It 's lonely without you .
YURI: A party .
AVA: It 's always a party where you are . More gunfire interrupts .
YURI: I 'd better go . I just wanted to callhea your voice . Kiss Nicki for me .
AVA: I love you . But Yuri has gone .
YURI: Thank him but I have other business . A busy schedule .
GLORIA: Hello , Mr. Yuri .
FAITH: We 'd be happy to make you happy .
GLORIA: Do n't worry , we do n't have anything .
YURI: How do you know ?
FAITH: Do we look like it ?
YURI: What if I have AIDS ? Do n't you worry ? Gloria 's lips gently touch his .
GLORIA: You worry too much . Faith begins to unbutton his shirt .
FAITH: Why worry about something that can kill you in ten years when there are so many things that can kill you today ?
GLORIA: How can we make you happy ?
YURI: By leaving .
BAPTISTE: What did you say ?
YURI: Now you 're going to have to buy it . It 's a used gun . I ca n't sell a used gun .
BAPTISTE: A used gun . That 's a good one . The other Officers laugh uncertainly .
YURI: You ca n't just look at the unit price . You forget the ancillary costs . End use certificates need to be forged and notarized , shell companies set up , insurance purchased , pilots and crews hired . Not to mention the bribes . You ca n't get a nut and bolt out of the Eastern bloc without a ibe . There 's one bribe for the nut . Another for the bolt . This is an expensive proposition . Andre interrogates Yuri 's eyes .
BAPTISTE: I pay in timberor stones .
YURI: I 'll take the stones . It 's hard to get a tree trunk in my hand luggage .
BAPTISTE: Very professional , Lieutenant .
LIEUTENANT: Dismissed ! Yuri and Andre watch the troops disperse .
YURI: I know you 're planning a new offensive . If you delay a week I can get you the armored personnel carriers we talked about . They would give you a significant strategic advantage .
BAPTISTE: They say I am the lord of war . But perhaps it is you .
YURI: It 's not `` lord of war '' . It 's `` warlord '' .
BAPTISTE: I like it my way .
AVA: Yuri , I just got off the phone with the dealer . I sold my first painting . Yuri and Vitaly greet each other with a nod .
YURI: Fantastic . Who bought it ?
AVA: Someone important . They want to remain anonymous . How was your trip ?
YURI: You know . Same old , same old . Where 's Nicki , in bed ?
AVA: I 'm sorry . Poor darling . He tried to stay up .
YURI: I 'll kiss him goodnight .
VITALY: This calls for a drink .
YURI: What does n't ?
AVA: My first painting . I 'm officially an artist !
YURI: How are you , brother ?
VITALY: You know , still the resident family fuck-up .
YURI: Someone has to do it .
VITALY: She knows , right ?
YURI: We do n't talk about it . Vitaly looks askance . YURI How many car salesmen talk about their work , how many executives at cigarette companies ? And both of their products kill more people every year than mine . At least mine has a safety switch . If those guys can leave their work at the office , why ca n't I ?
VITALY: Shit , you 're good . You almost had me convinced . We 're going , baby .
YURI: To Manet , Monetand Ava Cordova .
AVA: Yuri !
YURI: The trip went better than expected .
AVA: Yuri , they 're beautiful . But what am I going to wear them with ?
YURI: I know just the outfit . They kiss .
VALENTINE: Where in God 's name is he going ? Is he lost ?
AVA: Vitalyit 's Ava .
PILOT: Even taking into consideration the pay-off to the parents , a week with a girl in Burkina Faso is cheaper than a night with a girl in Jersey .
YURI: Colonel Southern , it 's Yuri . Sorry to call you on this number but I 've got an Interpol jet and The jet outside the window falls back .
COL. SOUTHERN: I ca n't know you right now . It 's not a good time . Southern hangs up .
YURI: Not a good time !
VALENTINE: Charlie , Echo , India . Comply immediately . That was your last warning .
YURI: Where was the first fucking warning ? !
VALENTINE: Rock your wings if you intend to comply .
PILOT: I 'm putting us down .
YURI: You land and we 're all going away ! I do n't have paperwork !
PILOT: We 're in a flying fucking bomb ! They 're firing bullets at our bullets ! Forget about going away ! They shoot again , we 're going away for good ! I 'm putting us down .
YURI: Okay ! Okay ! Fuck ! ! The pilot responds on the radio .
PILOT: This is Charlie Echo India . Descending on heading zero two nine .
YURI: Not the airport . There . The highway . It 's our only fucking hope .
PILOT: A pothole could set us off .
YURI: Do n't underestimate yourself . You 're the est , Tony .
VALENTINE: He ca n't get far . I want a truck waiting on the tarmac .
YURI: We 're going to be okay .
PILOT: As far from the evidence as I can . The pilots start running down the highway .
YURI: Wait , you idiots ! There 's not going to be any evidence ! Stay with the plane ! The pilots ignore him - run for their lives .
VALENTINE: Hey , you !
MBIZI: You run from us . Can you run with no legs ? Valentine rushes over , pulls Mbizi off Yuri .
VALENTINE: No , Mbizi . No , no , no .
MBIZI: Let me disappear him , Mr. Valentine . He is a devil . Let me disappear him .
VALENTINE: I ca n't do that .
MBIZI: Look where we are . Who will know ?
VALENTINE: We will . Mbizi stops struggling against Valentine .
MBIZI: Turn your back , Mr. Valentine . I will go to hell to stop him .
VALENTINE: No . Find the pilots .
YURI: What 's the charge ?
VALENTINE: What are you doing in Sierra Leone ?
YURI: I 'm on safari .
VALENTINE: Shooting wildebeests with submachine guns ?
YURI: Are you with the park service ? Hunting without a license - is that the charge ?
VALENTINE: You 're trafficking arms .
YURI: Trading . But without evidence who can say ?
VALENTINE: Trade or traffic , you make a fortune by keeping the poorest people on the planet killing each other . Do you know why I do what I do ?
YURI: I do n't want people dead , Agent Valentine . I admit , a shooting war is better fo usiness . But I 'd prefer people to fire my guns and miss . Just as long as they 're firing .
VALENTINE: I am legally permitted to hold you fo twenty-four hours without charging you . Yuri looks away , knows where this is going . VALENTINE You may ask , why do I bother to do that ? I can assure you , it is not because I enjoy you company . And you may be surprised to learn
VIVIAN: Yuri ! Yuri Orlov !
YURI: Vivian
VIVIAN: What are you doing here ?
YURI: You know . Fighting the good fight .
VIVIAN: An aid program ?
YURI: Uh , yes . In fact , I 've just had some transport problems . You could n't give me a ide to Monrovia , could you ?
VIVIAN: Sure . Climb in .
YURI: Jesus ! Simeon !
BARMAN: He bought you `` brown-brown '' , Mr. Yuri .
YURI: What ?
BARMAN: `` Brown-brown '' .
YURI: What is it ?
BARMAN: A mixture - cocaine and gunpowder .
YURI: What does the gunpowder do ?
BARMAN: It 's magic . They give it to the small boys efore battle - they do anything .
YURI: Some other time .
BARMAN: You have to try it at least once , Mr. Yuri . The Barman starts chopping another line .
YURI: Why ?
BARMAN: Because it 's your gunpowder .
YURI: I 'm going for a walk .
PROSTITUTE: It 's not what I would call a fuck .
YURI: Are you sick ? She ignores him . YURI Are you sick ? !
GIRL #1: They will !
GIRL #2: Ask the foreigner . The foreigner will know .
YURI: Hello .
GIRL #1: Sir , will my fingers grow back ?
YURI: Simeon .
MAN #1: Do n't . He 's Andre 's .
MAN #2: Fuck Andre .
YURI: Yeah , fuck Andre .
MAN #1: Fuck off ! The man whips the gun across Yuri 's face .
ANDRE BAPTISTE: Yuri , you fucked up ! I am going to shoot your face off with your own gun . Yuri does n't flinch .
YURI: Not bad . Andre 's latest double ?
ANDRE BAPTISTE: How did you know ?
YURI: He 's too eloquent .
ANDRE BAPTISTE: You have no heart .
YURI: More good news . That 's the last aid shipment . The war is so bad , the U.N. is pulling out .
ANDRE BAPTISTE: Why is nothing happening ?
YURI: There are trucks . You just have to get all that food out of them .
AVA: Hush , Nicki . I do n't believe you . Valentine is unfazed . AVA Can you prove any of it ? Where is you evidence ?
VALENTINE: I was hoping you could help us with that . I understand your parents died tragically in EI Salvador . That regime has startling similarities to several of the regimes supplied by you husband .
AVA: Get out .
YURI: Ava , what 's wrong ? Where 's Nicki ?
AVA: He 's with your parents . Yuri senses something very wrong .
YURI: Why are n't you dressed ? I thought we were going out .
AVA: I ca n't wear the clothes . I ca n't wear the jewelry . I ca n't drive the car . I ca n't live in this house . Everything1s got blood on it .
YURI: Do n't be so melodramatic .
YURI: Why ? We never have before .
AVA: Now we do .
YURI: These people - you ca n't trust them
AVA: I 've talked to your parents . Why do you think they do n't want your money ? They know where it comes from . We all know . Yuri sighs , resigned .
YURI: I sell people a means to defend themselves , Ava . That 's all . I do n't hold a gun to any one 's head and make them shoot
AVA: Yuri , I see the news . Sierra Leone
YURI: I do n't sell machetes .
AVA: What do you think is pointing at the victims when they use those machetes ? I see the pictures . Yuri , the guns are bigge than the boys .
YURI: There 's nothing illegal about what I do .
AVA: I do n't care if it 's legal , it 's wrong . Ava meets his eye . AVA I can accept the drugs . I can even accept the other women . I ca n't accept this . Yuri looks away .
YURI: It makes no difference if I stop . Someone will take my place the next day .
AVA: Let them . We have enough . You 're not that little boy in Odessa anymore , lining up fo a loaf of bread
YURI: It 's not about the money .
AVA: What is it ?
YURI: You ca n't leave . I 'll stop . I 'll stop .
AVA: You will ? You promise ?
YURI: Yes . Now get dressed . We 'll go out . Ava picks up the dress off the bed . Yuri gazes at her . YURI By the way , you 're wrong about not being pretty any more . She turns back and smiles .
AVA: Yuri , the President of Liberia is in the lobby .
YURI: He 's early .
TEENAGE GIRL: Liberia . Is that on Long Island ?
YURI: What the fuck are you doing here , Andre ?
ANDRE BAPTISTE: We 're here for the peace talks at the U.N .
YURI: So at the same time you thought you 'd drop in on your arms dealer ? !
ANDRE BAPTISTE: Is that what you still are ? You 're a hard man to get hold of all of a sudden .
ANDRE BAPTISTE: But now you mention it , we are doing a little shopping while we 're here - that is if you open for business .
YURI: They 've got to be watching .
ANDRE BAPTISTE: Of course they blame me . They always blame me . They are on a
YURI: hunt for a witch ?
ANDRE BAPTISTE: `` Witch-hunt '' . But I have been granted diplomatic immunity due to the escalation in hostilities . That is why I need you . They are making life difficult to re-supply . It will equire a man of your unusual ingenuity .
YURI: I ca n't help you . I 'm sorry .
ANDRE BAPTISTE: I understand . He shakes Yuri 's hand firmly . ANDRE BAPTISTE But you should know that our present difficulties compel us to be unusually generous .
AVA: Was that about the oil or the timber ?
YURI: Both . Everything . Ava smiles , carries on reading .
AVA: Sorry , Nicki has swim practice . Nicolai kisses his father .
NICOLAI: Bye , Papa .
YURI: See you , big guy . Ava kisses Yuri .
AVA: Personally , I 'm glad you 're going . You 've een here so long you 're starting to get on my nerves .
YURI: This oil concession should be wrapped up by Thursday . I 'll be back for the weekend . We 'll go somewhere - the sea .
AVA: That would be fun . A thought occurs to Yuri .
YURI: You trust me , right ?
AVA: Yes , I trust you .
NICOLAI: Where are we going , Mama ?
AVA: It 's a game .
NICOLAI: Like hide and seek ?
AVA: Yes .
VITALY: Come to see how the other half lives ?
YURI: I miss your borscht . Mom and Dad say you 're clean .
VITALY: You too . They said you went legitimate - hard to believe .
YURI: That 's because it 's not true . Vitaly is hardly surprised .
VITALY: I ca n't . I 'm thinking of opening my own place .
YURI: Maybe this trip will help . It 's good money .
VITALY: I 've given my word .
YURI: They do n't have to know . We 'll tell them we 're going for a little `` r '' and `` r '' .
VITALY: Why do you need me all of a sudden ?
YURI: West Africa 's fucked-up . More than usual . I ca n't trust anybody . I need someone to watch my back .
VITALY: Jesus . Vitaly comes to a horrific realization .
YURI: Not now .
VITALY: Now .
YURI: Excuse me . Vitaly draws Yuri out of earshot .
VITALY: We ca n't do this deal .
YURI: The fuck we ca n't .
VITALY: Look over there . As soon as we leave , they 're going to die .
YURI: It 's not our business .
VITALY: They killed a boy just now - as young as Nicki . Yuri flinches .
REBEL LEADER: What 's the hold up ?
YURI: There is no hold up . I 'll be right there . Yuri draws Vitaly further away . YURI Vitaly , it 's what we always know - we ca n't control what they do .
VITALY: Today we can . They 're right there - close enough to touch .
YURI: What do you think they 'll do if we back out - they 'll kill us .
VITALY: And if we go ahead - they 'll kill them .
REBEL LEADER: What is he saying ?
YURI: Nothing .
VITALY: Nothing . You 're right , Yuri . You 're right . Did I hear you say 300 IPG 's , 500 assault ifles and 800 grenades ? I thought it was 1,200 grenades . I 'd better check .
YURI: Vit ! ! Vitaly dashes for the second truck .
AGENT: Yuri Orlov , we 're with the Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco and Firearms .
YURI: Believe it or not , I only use the first two . The agents are not amused - handcuff Yuri .
AGENT: You have the right to remain silent . Use it . They march him away .
ANATOLY: `` Crimean Restaurant '' .
IRINA: Both my sons are dead .
VALENTINE: One of yours ? Yuri does n't take the bait .
YURI: Maybe he did . If I saw one of those coming at me , l 'd have heart failure .
VALENTINE: We performed the autopsy and released you other 's body to your family . You tried to do something decent , Yuri . You went against your nature . And now it 's cost you . Your brother 's funeral is looking a lot like your funeral .
YURI: Falsifying a death certificate ? That 's not going to hold me .
VALENTINE: You 're right , as usual .
YURI: Enjoy it .
VALENTINE: What ?
YURI: This . Tell me that I am everything you despise , that I am the personification of evil , that I 'm responsible for the breakdown of the social fabric of society and world order , that I am a one man genocide . Say everything you want to say to me now - ecause you do n't have long .
VALENTINE: Are you not paying attention or are you delusional ? You 've broken every arms embargo written . There 's enough in those iefcases to buy you consecutive life sentences . You 'll spend ten years going from a cell to a courtroom before you even start doing your time .
YURI: My family has disowned me . My wife and son have left me . My brother is dead . Trust me , I fully appreciate the seriousness of my situation . But I promise you I wo n't spend a single second in a courtroom . Valentine laughs derisively .
VALENTINE: You are delusional .
YURI: I like you , Jack . Well , maybe not . But I understand you . You feel your loyalty to your badge has finally been rewarded . But you have n't counted on the people who gave you that badge . Valentine 's turn to hesitate . YURI Let me tell you what 's going to happen so you can prepare yourself . Yuri nods to the interview room door . YURI Soon there 's going to be a knock on that door and you 're going to be called outside .
VALENTINE: I would tell you to go to hell . But I think you 're already there .
YURI: What if I 'm not ? What if I sleep fine at night ? What if I sleep better than you ? I think that 's what truly scares you .
BORDER OFFICER: Umbrellas - to Saudi Arabia ?
YURI: Sun umbrellas .
BORDER OFFICER: Have a safe trip . The Officer waves the convoy through .
YURI: For someone who 's never fired a gun or been in a battle , I have suffered many casualties in my life . I guess that 's how I survived . I never went to war
JENSEN: And get cheated again ?
POOCH: The Pooch do n't cheat . The Pooch may lie , the Pooch may steal
JENSEN: the Pooch may refer to himself in the third person
POOCH: but the Pooch will not cheat .
JENSEN: The Pooch can rest easy , I was eferring to Cougar .
ROQUE: Cards .
JENSEN: Got a feeling about this one , Roque .
ROQUE: Your mama had that feeling too .

FINISHES CHECKING: We 're good , this baby came out of the Kandahar Spook Station , controller 's codename is Max .
ROQUE: This is an Agency gig ?
CLAY: We do n't get to pick what needs to e done . Quaeda-wannabe name of Fadhil is unning a terrorist assembly line out around the Khyber Pass
JENSEN: I 'm shocked . Shocked , I say .
CLAY: We find it , we paint it for a lase targeted bomb . No muss , no fuss .
ROQUE: For that we had to put on a lindfold and turn around three times ?
POOCH: You 'd rather take on fifty mujas with AK 's ?
ROQUE: I got eyes on Fadhil .
CLAY: Paint it .
POOCH: Call me Michelangelo .
JENSEN: Dropkick , this is Pinball , confirmed eyes on , target is designated .
FILTERED: Roger , target acquired , exfil chopper is enroute . ETA to fireworks is eight minutes .
JENSEN: Roger , we 'll break out the earplugs . So who wants to get a game ? We got eight minutes-
COUGAR: Boss ?
CLAY: Call it in .

MILITARY NETWORK: MAX Very stupid , Colonel Franklin Clay .
CLAY: Max ? There are children on site-
JENSEN: Ca n't , they 're jamming us-
ROQUE: Then contact the plane directly-
JENSEN: Negative , we 're screwed !
LOOKING UP: There 's nothing we can do
CLAY: There 's something we can do .
ROQUE: Five against a fortress , and we 've got maybe six minutes before an airstrike sets the world on fire .
CLAY: So ?
ROQUE: So , I 'll drive .
POOCH: I guess we 're going with the fifty mujas with AK 's option after all !
CLAY: Pooch and Jensen , get a truck fo the kids , the rest of us will be out in five-
ROQUE: -airstrike 's in four and change-
CLAY: -out in four . On me !

POOCH: Jesus , you stop for coffee in there ?
ROQUE: What kind of blast radius we looking at ?
JENSEN: I think we 're in the clear-
POOCH: Uh , Coug ?
JENSEN: Yeah , that was great , was n't it ? My favorite part was when we were completely on fire . What was yours ?
POOCH: Exfil incoming . How are we gon na explain the kids , Colonel ?
CLAY: Lieutenant , you 're to evac these civvies to the Firebase immediately-
BLACKHAWK PILOT: Negative , our orders are to transport a five-man team only .
CLAY: You really want to leave twenty three kids in the desert to die ?
BLACKHAWK PILOT: Not enough room for them and you
CLAY: Then it 's them .
POOCH: Cute little buggers . Hope they can make it to our court-martial .
ROQUE: Relax , Pooch , we 're not going to e court-martialed - if anything , we 're going to die of thirst wandering the desert , right Colonel ?
CLAY: Jensen , see if you can cut into that Blackhawk 's chatterI want to know if he rats us out .

JENSEN: Guys This is bad
CALMLY: Fox One .
POOCH: Auto-rotate , go with it , you can still put her down if you-
CLAY: NO !
FENNEL: What are you talking about `` MAX ? ''
CLAY: He set up the Operation-
FENNEL: There was no operation ! You were never radioed orders !
CLAY: I talked to him !
FENNEL: You kill a friendly Afghan warlord , probably lose us the support of half the tribes in the region , and your alibi is `` MAX ? ''
PAUSE: Wait - are you saying you 're Max ?
CLAY: What ?
FENNEL: Colonel , Max is an Agency code fo a rogue agent or operation-
CLAY: What are you talking-
WADE: `` Max '' is catch-all for exactly what you 've been accused of . Terminology 's been around since the 50 's .
CLAY: We did n't kill those kids , Wade . Wade studies him . Finally
WADE: I believe you .
FENNEL: Stay here . We 'll be back .
POOCH: Wade left his suitcase .
ROQUE: Ah , shit
CLAY: Jensen ?

ROQUE: You placed the bet .
CLAY: You gave me the money .
ROQUE: Well , that was stupid of me , was n't it ?
CLAY: Four .
ROQUE: You know where you 're messing up ? You 're putting all our money on the dogs with the best odds .
CLAY: Yeah , I 've just gone crazy with that approach .
ROQUE: Never play a longshot , you 're neve gon na win .
CLAY: Maybe if we were drinking .
ROQUE: You 're not drinking ?
CLAY: We 'll stay two more days , try to get some of the cash back .
ROQUE: Then what ?
CLAY: Miami . Jai-Alai .
ROQUE: I ca n't take much more of this .
CLAY: We 're on the run . It occasionally
ROQUE: I 'm serious . Grinding out lunch money on five dollar sports bets , wincing everytime some overly Aqua- netted cow stares at my face fo more than two seconds-
DELICATELY: I 'm at the point where I 'm thinking we ought to try to reach out to the Company
CLAY: All we did was say the word `` Max '' and they blew up a building . CIA even gets a whiff of where we 're at , they 'll call in an airstrike . Until we figure out how we can take Max down and get clear , we lay low .
ROQUE: Due respect , you 're nobody 's Colonel anymore .
CLAY: Anytime you want to move along you go right ahead-
ROQUE: Like the others ? Least I still talk to them . You pushed them away . `` Max this , Max that '' - we never even saw the guy , Clay-
CLAY: We heard his voice . Guy with a voice is a guy with a throat . And if he 's got a throat
ROQUE: We 're hiding out in the parking lot of a goddamn McDonald'sYou actually think we 're in any position to take on some shadowy CIA super- spook ?
CLAY: ROQUE-
ROQUE: No , it 's a stellar plan - we can use this as our base of ops ! ( gestures to the
PLAYGROUND: Pooch can run the motor pool out of the ball pit and Jensen can set up communications by the slide !
CLAY: Go .
ROQUE: I was there too . I remember . But he won . We lost .
PAUSE: Maybe it 's time for a new game .
AISHA: Men .
CLAY: Meaty .

AISHA: Slows me down .
CLAY: Okay .
AISHA: You got nice arms .
CLAY: I know you ?
AISHA: Relax , slugger I like arms . That 's all .
CLAY: Do I not look relaxed ?
AISHA: No .
PAUSE: Think we can change that ?
AISHA: Wow , it 's everything a girl could dream of . Got a bathroom ?
CLAY: No , I specifically requested the only hotel room in the world that does n't have a bathroom .
AISHA: You lookin ' to turn a `` yes '' into a `` no '' here ?
CLAY: Convention .
AISHA: They have whole conventions devoted to air conditioners ?
CLAY: You 'd be surprised .
AISHA: Bet I would . Where were we ?
CLAY: You were about to tell me how much you enjoy spending time at the dog track
AISHA: Saw me there did you ?
CLAY: Uh-huh
AISHA: Did n't see me at the McDonald 's though
CLAY: You 're not going to .
AISHA: Yes , I am .
CLAY: Noticed . What do you want ?
AISHA: Your life . Back .
CLAY: You want to clarify that ?
AISHA: Max . I can help you .
CLAY: I 'm listening .
AISHA: It 's not too tough if you know where to look . You guys are n't exactly subtle .
CLAY: How 'd you know I was alive ?
AISHA: Counted the number of teeth found in the safehouse debris in Karachi . Not nearly enough for five men .
CLAY: Who else knows ?
AISHA: That you 're alive ? Just me .
CLAY: So what 's to stop me from putting a bullet in your head ?
AISHA: You want Max and I can tell you how to get him .
CLAY: Max is up to something big , is n't he ? Agency would n't have sent you otherwise .
AISHA: Nice try , but I 'm working alone here . If I was n't , I would n't need your help . Ready for the important part ?
CLAY: Okay .
AISHA: This plane contains a truck .
CLAY: Okay .
AISHA: This truck contains a cargo .
CLAY: Right .
AISHA: This cargo is very important .
CLAY: Is this a riddle ?
AISHA: This cargo belongs to Max . You steal the cargo , Max comes looking for it , you grab Max .
CLAY: What a brilliant plan , and oh , so simple too . What 's the cargo ?
AISHA: Hey ! You really think I look good in these jeans ?
CLAY: Bye
AISHA: Cargo 's heroin . Max uses it to fund his off the books ops . And it comes straight from the poppy fields of the late Jamal al-Fadhil . Oh does that name mean something to you ?
CLAY: How do I know I can trust you ?
AISHA: Check my background . I 'm an ex- Company hitter . First job was a junior field officer in Shanghai . You can Google it under Shanghai Hilton Decapitation .
CLAY: I mostly Google porn . Then ?
AISHA: Two Chinese and an Italian arms dealer in Bangkok . With my hands .
CLAY: Show-off . Then ?
AISHA: Then I stopped auditioning fo you . This is a check for ten grand-
CLAY: We 're not mercenaries .
AISHA: Operational capital , that 's all . You 've been waiting three years for a shot at this guy . You 're not gon na get another . You want Max , this is it .
SHORT SCIENTIST: You know we can not do this We can not do what you ask
MAX: Tell me - is this a moral issue o a financial issue ?
FAT SCIENTIST: A moral issue .
ACTUALLY CURIOUS: Really ? You object morally to this deal ?
FAT SCIENTIST: Yes . I 'm sorry . Please leave
MAX: Okay , here 's what I 'm hearing . I 'm hearing `` No . '' I 'm hearing `` Leave , '' and I 'm hearing `` I 'm sorry . '' Is that what I 'm hearing ?
FAT SCIENTIST: Please you must leave
MAX: Right . Okay , so that is what I 'm hearing . Now , I want you to listen . Listen carefully because I want you to hear this . Wade ?
WADE: You gave me the nod .
MAX: A `` hit him in the face '' nod , not a `` throw him out the window '' nod .
WADE: I thought that 's what you wanted .
MAX: At mostat most that was a `` break his fingers '' nod . I mean Jesus , Wade , the man was scientific genius . Granted his weight signaled that he had certain impulse control issues , but that 's no reason to throw his fat ass out a fifty story window .
WADE: Sorry
MAX: I think I speak for everyone here when I say that your actions were excessive and , yes , more than just a little wasteful
SHORT SCIENTIST: Wait !
MAX: The hell you say .
PAUSE: I need one to test and one to use .
SHORT SCIENTEST: One to test ?
MAX: Of course one to test - you think I trust you ?
SHORT SCIENTIST: We will need much money .
MAX: You will have much money .
CLAY: Better than a ball pit
ROQUE: You sure you 're thinking clear on this ? I know you . When you slip , it 's always cause of a woman .
CLAY: Name one time that-
ROQUE: Carla .
CLAY: Carla was n't the problem , Carla 's husband was the problem-
ROQUE: Carla 's husband was n't the one who
CLAY: Okay . Yes . She shot me .
PAUSE: But only in the leg .
ROQUE: What about Emma ?
CLAY: Emma does n't count , we never slept together .
ROQUE: Because she put a bomb in you car .
CLAY: I admit , that took some of the omance out of the relationship .
ROQUE: And now this chick , first time you meet her , burns down our hotel . Also , she kills people for a living . These are not good signs
CLAY: I 'm clear , Roque .
ROQUE: You better be . Or we 're done .
POOCH: Damn . We missed you too .
ROQUE: How long you been back there ?
AISHA: Long enough .
TO CLAY: She put a bomb in your car ?
CLAY: She was volatile . Aisha , meet Pooch , Roque , and Cougar .
AISHA: Really ? You ca n't hang out with anyone just named `` Phil '' ?
JENSEN: Hail , hail , the gang 's all here ! Colonel . Roque . Pooch . Silent Bob . Hottie .
TO AISHA: I 'm gon na need a moment alone with the boys if you do n't mind , but I 'd like to reserve the right to awkwardly hit on you later ?
AISHA: I 'd expect no less .
TO CLAY: Have fun
CLAY: What do you have on her ?
JENSEN: Besides a pants-busting crush ?
OPENING LAPTOP: Her intel checks out . The cargo will be arriving here in two days .
ROQUE: Wow , I completely trust her now .
CLAY: What else ?
JENSEN: Grew up in Afghanistan , Mom was a local , Dad was white devil oh , and CIA 's got a kill order out on her .
MORE: 37 .
POOCH: Why ?
JENSEN: Last CIA email flagged with he name says she was digging fo information about a special project `` Codename MAX '' . A moment as this sinks in .
POOCH: They want to wet her cause she 's lookin ' into Max . That sounds familiar
ROQUE: Could those files-
JENSEN: -have been planted for us to find ? CIA timestamp , digital watermark Someone would 've had to go to a lot of trouble , and I mean a lot , to fool me .
CLAY: I say we go with her . Pooch ?
POOCH: I 'm in .
CLAY: Jensen ?
JENSEN: Hell yeah . Cougs ?
ROQUE: For now .
JENSEN: Hot damn ! Back with the Colonel , doing another bid for God and
ROQUE: Country turned her back on us , and God can screw . This one 's for us .
CLAY: And anyone who calls me `` Colonel '' etter be ready to take a beating or an order . We ai n't soldiers anymore .
HAPPY NONETHELESS: So what 's the plan , my civilian others ?
CLAY: Sleep . We start tomorrow .
JENSEN: Start where ?
CLAY: We 're going bird hunting .
MAX: 90 percent of the globe is tooling up to whack us and we 're too busy losing our nerve to notice . It 's Us versus Them and right now my money would be on them
WADE: The Company 's with you on this ?
MAX: Kinda Sorta
WADE: I do n't . Just want to make sure everyone gets paid .
MAX: The money 's coming from ou Afghanistan operation . And what the Company does n't know wo n't hurt them .
WADE: Unless they 're within the blast adius .
MAX: We 're gon na saving our country , Wade . The United States of America will benefit greatly from what we 're doing .
WADE: I was born in Quebec .
MAX: Jesus , fine - we 're saving North America , does that make you happy ? Just get it done .

JENSEN: Lot of work to bum a ride .
ROQUE: Shut up , Jensen .
JENSEN: You shut up , Roque . You 're dead , I 'm the spinal injury - Spinal injury can talk , dead ca n't .

CLAY: Hit it .
JENSEN: Beautiful . Let 'em chase that .
POOCH: Time to move .
DRUGGED SOLDIER: Well , shit .
POOCH: no , what you want is a gas turbine generator running a force- fed rectifier unit , hook it up to the fuel tank
JENSEN: So , you grew up in the Hindu Kush , huh ? That must 've been rough .
AISHA: Uh-huh
JENSEN: Got any hobbies ?
AISHA: When I was a girl , I collected human ears . I had over three dozen pairs when a feral dog came into our camp one night and took them . The dog was good eating , though . A beat .
JENSEN: I 'm gon na go somewhere else now .
AISHA: Are small arms gon na be a problem ?
POOCH: It 's taken care of - we lined the hull with half inch steel plate .
ROQUE: Which brings us to our next question
CLAY: Roque
AISHA: I 'm giving you a chance to get even . That 's all you need to know .
ROQUE: I 'm gon na shoot her , Clay .

CLAY: What do you think we are now ? Best case scenario , this gets us face to face with Max-
ROQUE: What if it does n't ? What if we never get face to face with him . Are you gon na be able to live with that ? Ever ?
POOCH: Hell , let 's just say it out loud
PAUSE: We do this , we 're declaring war on the Central Intelligence Agency .
COUGAR: They started it .
FENNEL: As of this moment , the truck is designated an extraterritorial zone of immunity . Under no circumstances whatsoever are you or your men to allow the package to leave the truck before it 's secure in the compound - to do so would be considered an act of treason and punishable as such .
LIDDY: Understood and acknowledged , sir .
WADE: Ten men ride with the package and another ten ride chase .
CLAY: Are we wired ?
JENSEN: Like Belushi .
SWAT DRIVER: Shit , I 'm losing it !
WADE: Form a defensive perimeter around the truck !
FENNEL: They 're out of their minds , there 's no way off this bridge
WADE: Masks on ! Secure the package !
SWAT GUY: Where are they ? I ca n't see them-

SOLDIER 1: Sir , that smell ! It's- gasoline !
FENNEL: Eat the ground , or they blow you head off !
CLAY: I do n't think so .
FENNEL: First and only warning , Clay !
CLAY: Gasoline . Muzzle flash . Think about it .
FENNEL: Clay , no bullshit - you open that ox and we all die . Clay steps up to him . Near nose to nose .
CLAY: I 'm already dead , remember ?
JENSEN: Goliath the oil company ?
AISHA: It must be how he moves the drugs
ROQUE: Great . The super evil bad guy is in bed with the world 's largest oil company . That 's just fabulous .
POOCH: You want me to go ask Fennel the combination ?
JENSEN: Nah , I can bypass no problem .
POOCH: Is that ?
CLAY: Yeah .
POOCH: Is that ?
CLAY: Yeah . Jensen , you 're up .
JENSEN: Huh ?
CLAY: The bomb .
JENSEN: But I 'm not good with bombs
CLAY: Get better .
JENSEN: Okay . Okay .
OPENING LAPTOP: Nukes . That 's a nuke . Who makes nukes ? Department of Defense . DOD Mainframe . I got ta hack the
ROQUE: SHOULD WE-
JENSEN: It would really be good if you did n't talk right now- get that casing off for me .
POOCH: What if that sets it off ?
CLAY: Then we die thirty seconds early - do it .
POOCH: I got wires - red , blue , green , white , yellow-
JENSEN: Okay , just hold position !
POOCH: There 's also pink-
JENSEN: Hold position !
AISHA: Are you trying to make this more dramatic ?
JENSEN: Almost Almost Shit !
AISHA: What ?
JENSEN: Computer crashed !
POOCH: Are you kidding me ?
JENSEN: Yes , cause this is the time fo
CLAY: JENSEN- 60 .
JENSEN: I told you , I 'm not good at bombs !
CLAY: Do you have time to reboot ?
POOCH: Okay , someone pick a color !
AISHA: Pull out all the wires .
ROQUE: What ?
AISHA: You ever hear of a clock radio that exploded cause you unplugged itpull out all the wires .
JENSEN: Opening it without the code must have triggered the timer
POOCH: You think ?
ROQUE: Did you know ?
AISHA: I just saved our lives-
ROQUE: Did you know ?
AISHA: Of course not !
ROQUE: Where the hell are you-
CLAY: Fennel .
FENNEL: Max thinks the country 's lost it 's way , gone soft in the War on Terror ! This is his solution !
CLAY: Elaborate .
FENNEL: He wanted us to nuke a U.S. target , pin it on the ragheads and boom - freedom is on the march again ! The same people who want us to pull back will be screaming to turn the place into a parking lot !
POOCH: What was the target ?
FENNEL: I CAN'T-
JENSEN: Holy shit , it 's like we were framed y Dr. No
AISHA: What about Goliath ?
JENSEN: Yeah , what would an oil company want with the Middle East ?
FENNEL: The ships that service thei offshore oil rigs are exempt from US Customs ! It 's how Max gets the drugs in and out of the country-
ROQUE: This is conspiracy theory bullshit-
FENNEL: It 's not ! There 's proof !
CLAY: Where ?
FENNEL: Max 's heroin operation - Goliath keeps accounts of the shipments !
JENSEN: Come on , dude , they 'd be morons to keep records of shit like this-
FENNEL: It 's on a stand-alone hard drive ! It 's their insurance policy against Max - they know he 's crazy , this way they have something on him !
CLAY: So this hard drive - it contains evidence of what Max has been doing ?
FENNEL: Yes !
CLAY: Can you get us this drive ?
FENNEL: I do n't know where it is ! They do n't let me have access ! But-
CLAY: I say we hit Goliath headquarters .
ROQUE: And do what - go after this non- existent hard drive ?
CLAY: We find out if it exists . If it does , we steal it and trade it fo immunity .
ROQUE: That 's your plan ?
CLAY: You got a better one ?
MORE: 64 .
ROQUE: Why risk our lives again when we already have something to trade ?
CLAY: You want to give it back to him ?
ROQUE: I want to at least discuss it before signing up for another suicide mission on the say-so of some flunky-
CLAY: It 's not happening .
ROQUE: So you want to take down Goliath now ? Then who ? McDonald 's ? American Airlines ? Microsoft ?
CLAY: You do n't want Max to pay ?
ROQUE: I want my life back ! This is supposed to be us getting clear - not saving the world !
POOCH: ROQUE-
ROQUE: We 're not the goddamn good guys anymore ! I love you guys , but I had a life before this shit , and I sure as hell am not going to risk getting it back because you came down with a case of the Dudley Damn Do-Rights !
CLAY: Do n't raise your voice at me-
ROQUE: I will raise whatever the hell I want - you got a death wish because you got beat by a voice on a radio-
POOCH: I say we hit Goliath . Jensen ?
JENSEN: Goliath . Cougs ?
CLAY: Aisha ?
ROQUE: She does n't get a vote-
AISHA: Goliath .
POOCH: Put it away
CLAY: You want your life back , you 're gon na have to steal it . We hit them in two days .
JENSEN: Don'tcha hate it when Mom and Dad fight ?
POOCH: So what do we do about the nuke ?
PAUSE: Did I just actually say that ?
AISHA: I have an idea
WADE: That 's gon na be a quick trial
MAX: Wonderful guy , salt of the earth , he 'll be missedwho took my bomb , Wade ?
WADE: You 're not gon na like it
MAX: Because I 've been such a fan of how things have gone up till now ?
WADE: Colonel Clay and his unit . You had them killed three years ago ?
MAX: I also had several African nations overthrown three years ago , I 'm a
WADE: The Jamal al-Fadhil situation ?
MAX: Shit .
WADE: Yeah .
MAX: Okay , they need to get dead . Get me a six man fire team ready in twelve hours .
WADE: So what 's the plan ?
MAX: What 's the plan ? The plan is - get me a six man fire team ready in twelve hours .
WADE: Okay .
MAX: Are we now clear on the plan or do you want to try a third go-around ?
WADE: WE 'RE CLEAR-
MAX: Because what I 'm going to need you to do is get me a six man fire team ready in twelve hours . You get that , right ?
WADE: I get it .
MAX: And Wade ?
SHORT SCIENTIST: We appreciate you meeting us in a single story facility .
WADE: No problem .
MORE: 69 .
SHORT SCIENTIST: I agree . Now that we know each other , know , please , that if you come near me with any more of that Yankee Doodle tough guy bullshit , you will be fed to my dogs .
WADE: Fair enough , Doc . Can we now move past the verbal aggression and get into some business ?
SHORT SCIENTIST: You want another device . One illion dollars is now the price . One billion dollars cash .
WADE: That 's going to be difficult .
SHORT SCIENTIST: Life the way you people want to live it is very difficult , Mr. Wade . You want less difficult move to my country , study Hinduism . Meditate . Cultivate serenity . Much less difficult . You want to uy atomic bombs I 'm afraid that is a more difficult way of life .
WADE: He wants one billion in cash .
MAX: That 's a lot of a paper routes
WADE: Can we swing it ?
MAX: Not even close .
WADE: The Company ?
MAX: Wo n't give it to us willingly
THINKING: You get that six man team togethe like I asked ?
WADE: Yeah .
MAX: Change of plans . Kill them .
WADE: Kill them ?
MAX: Or fire them , whichever 's easier .
WADE: Honestly ? Firing them .
MAX: Fine , fine , I 'm not a detail guy . What I need- wait . Did you give them intel on Clay 's people ?
WADE: Well , yeah .
MAX: Aaaand we 're back to killing them .
WADE: Fine , I 'll kill them - what are we doing instead ?
MAX: Touchy , touchy . Jeez , what are you related to them ?
WADE: Actually , one of them , yes .
MAX: By blood ?
WADE: A brother-in-law , I said I 'd kill him , what are we doing ?
MAX: It 's not what we 're doing , it 's what Clay is going to do for us
WADE: And that is ?
MAX: Get us our billion dollars
CLAY: I was just going over the plan .
AISHA: So , what really happened to you in Afghanistan ?
CLAY: That 's not for you .
AISHA: He 's a bad man . Is n't that enough ?
CLAY: No .
AISHA: When you tell me about Afghanistan ? I 'll tell you about Max .
CLAY: Fine . It 's hot . There 's lots of sand . Your turn .
AISHA: Why were you alone when I found you ?
CLAY: The guys got sick of it .
AISHA: Sick of what ?
CLAY: Of hearing about Max . Of hearing me say we had to do something when there was n't anything to do . They wanted to be around their families . Jensen has a sister . Pooch has a wife and daughters .
AISHA: And he has n't told them he is alive ?
CLAY: Would you ? The people you loved the most , would you put them in that kind of danger ? Aisha , side-stepping the question
AISHA: So Roque has no one .
CLAY: He 's got me .
AISHA: And you have
CLAY: Enough hate to get us both through the day . He stuck with me when no one else would . And I ai n't the easiest guy to stick with .
AISHA: If you two really fought , he would kill you , I think .
CLAY: You think .
AISHA: I 'm almost sure of it .
CLAY: Why ?
AISHA: Because you care what happens to the others . You would n't put them at risk to save yourself .
CLAY: And you think that 's a weakness .
AISHA: I know it is . Law of the jungle .
CLAY: We 're not in the jungle .
AISHA: Oh , yes we are
ROQUE: Well , that 's just great .
POOCH: We 're not going anywhere until you two squash this shit .
CLAY: Pooch , we 're on a schedule here-
POOCH: Good . Roque ?
ROQUE: Sorry I threatened to cut you head off .
POOCH: Verrrry good . Now do n't you two feel better ?
IN UNISON: No .
POOCH: I do n't give a shit , I do . Now , let 's go watch Jensen single- handedly knock over the largest oil company on the planet
JENSEN: I got jungle fever , you 've got jungle fever , we 've got jungle fever , we 're in love
RECEPTIONIST: Excuse me one moment-
TO JENSEN: I 'll take that , thank you .
JENSEN: No can do , chica , got ta put it in his hands . He 's got ta sign .
RECEPTIONIST: I 'm sorrycould you say that again ?
JENSEN: Babydoll , I 'm on the clock here !
RECEPTIONIST: Forty fifth floor .
JENSEN: I got jungle fever , you 've got jungle fever , we 've got jungle fever , we 're in love
SECRETARY: Who 's calling , please ?
JENSEN: Richard Hertz from Internal Security .
SECRETARY: One moment , please
JENSEN: Ladies hi .
HENDERSON: This is Henderson .
JENSEN: Good afternoon , Mr. Henderson , Richard Hertz from Internal Security . If you 'd be kind enough to make your way down to the lobby ?
HENDERSON: Uh Can I ask what this is about ?
JENSEN: It 's a matter of a somewhat sensitive nature involving an
MORE: 78 .
JENSEN: Hi , I 'm Skippy from tech support . Is Henderson around ? I 'm supposed to install a firewall on his system-
SECRETARY: Oh , you just missed him by like two seconds . Can you come back in like an hour or so ?
JENSEN: Oooooh - no can do . Upstairs eathing down my neck . They want security upgraded for the senio managers all of a sudden .
SECRETARY: Security ?
JENSEN: According to this , the drive exists , Clay .
CLAY: You 're sure ?
JENSEN: Abso-tootly .
CLAY: Is it in the building ?
JENSEN: No , somewhere off-site . It 's got ta e a remote location , stand-alone . I 'm checking their security logs wherever they 've detailed the most guys is probably where it 'll be
THROUGH RADIO: There 's a fire exit thirty yards north of your position .
JENSEN: I 'm warning you , man , I 'm a lethal weapon Jensen turns on the big fellah .
THIRD GUARD: Please- d-do n't shoot
JENSEN: Face down , or I 'll make your hearts stop beating with my mind .
COUGAR: De Nada .
MAX: By your boys ?
WADE: They 're not `` my boys '' . I do n't like this . I say we grab Clay and kill the rest .
STILL LISTENING: If you can find them-
WADE: I can .
CONSIDERING: Okay . Put a fire team together .
WADE: You 're sure ? You 're not going to call me in two hours and have me kill them ? I 'm on it
JENSEN: Everything on Goliath - security , personnel history , the works . Aisha 's brow furrows at this . Only we notice .
CLAY: Where 's the drive being kept ?
JENSEN: Port of New York , baby . Total stand alone facility , and they 're spending 30K a day on onsite security - you do n't drop that kinda green to just guard oil .
ROQUE: What are we up against ?
JENSEN: Let me check , Ioh , shit
CLAY: What 's `` oh , shit '' ?
JENSEN: They 've hired Par-Sec .
CLAY: Oh , shit
AISHA: Who 's Par-Sec ?
JENSEN: Paradigm Security Services . Ex- Special Forces .
POOCH: Basically guys like Cougar but without the warm and cuddly side .
CLAY: Goliath must have brought them in after we hit their truck
JENSEN: Our drive is being guarded by military trained , trigger repressed , lood thirsty , stone cold killers Am I the only one who 's thinking maybe we just chill out and go to Six Flags ?
CLAY: Comb that drive for every last scrap of info . We 're on a plane for New York tomorrow
ROQUE: Thought you guys 'd be back at the hotel .
POOCH: Could n't sleep .
ROQUE: Me neither . Grabbed a coffee from the machine - you want one ?
POOCH: No thanks .
JENSEN: You wo n't believe how detailed these files are . Every Goliath executive they 've ever insured , their policies , their payouts-
ROQUE: Life insurance ?
JENSEN: Yeah .
ROQUE: What 's the biggest payout ?
JENSEN: Got ta be wrongful death
ROQUE: Pretty much what we 're gon na be isking .
TO POOCH: What are you doing up ?
POOCH: Jensen hacked a satellite for me earlier .
ROQUE: The hell you need a satellite for ?
POOCH: When we first went over in 2001 , Jolene and my oldest Tina wanted to do the yellow ribbon thing , ight ? Only problem was there was no yellow ribbon to be found - all the stores had been cleaned out .
ROQUE: Military neighborhood
POOCH: No doubt . And Tina 's four at the time , and what she ca n't understand is why the ribbon 's got ta be yellow . So Jolene sings her the song , right ? To show her where the idea comes from . And when she 's all done , Tina , four years old , looks my wife dead in her eye and says `` that 's the dumbest song I eve heard . ''
LAUGHING: So my wife and my four year old ended up tying a frilly purple ibbon round the old oak tree in our yard to bring Daddy home
ROQUE: Thought that counts , right ?
POOCH: Yeah
ROQUE: I hear you , man .
JENSEN: Okay , biggest payout on a Goliath exec ever - 14 million and it was wrongful death - Vice President of Operations in Afghanistan , three years ago , paid to his daughter
CLAY: You really want to know about Afghanistan ?
JENSEN: You think she 's gon na kill him ?
AISHA: And this man you found in the asement - he was your true target ?
CLAY: Max 's true target . Yeah .
AISHA: And you spoke with him ?
CLAY: He knew we were off mission . He knew Max wanted him dead
AISHA: Did he beg ?
CLAY: Excuse me ?
AISHA: The man in the basement . Did he eg for his life ?
CLAY: He begged to diewhy are you asking me this ?
JENSEN: Freeze !
AISHA: Would you rather I pointed it at your head ?
JENSEN: I know it makes no sense , but actually yes .
CLAY: Wait .
ROQUE: Shit , she 's got back-up !
COUGAR: Run .
ROQUE: Go , go , go !
POOCH: Think that got her ?
CLAY: She ai n't that lucky . Jensen , status !
JENSEN: My dick remains unshot !
ROQUE: Here they come
CLAY: Somebody shoot something !
JENSEN: I think Cougar 's got a plan ! Coug , do you have a plan ? He 's got a plan !
POOCH: Stop yelling at the sniper !
WADE: They got away .
MAX: So ?
MORE: 91 .
SHORT SCIENTIST: Do you have the money ?
MAX: Jesus , always with the money ! So impersonal ! How are you ? How have you been ?
SHORT SCIENTIST: I recently attended the funeral of my best friend who you had thrown out a window . How have you been ?
MAX: Ca n't complain . I 'm thinking of getting satellite radio in my car
SHORT SCIENTIST: I think you 're a freak . Too much Ronald McDonald . Too much fantasy football .
MAX: Hey , I 'm all about the bombs , baby .
SHORT SCIENTIST: We have your ordinance . You have twenty four hours to get the money .
MAX: Time to go make a withdrawal
SHORT SCIENTIST: New change of plan . You stay .
MAX: I 've got to go get your money .
SHORT SCIENTIST: He 'll get your money . You stay ight here .
MAX: God , are you short .
SHORT SCIENTIST: Twenty three hours , fifty nine minutes
MAX: Get it done .
SHORT SCIENTIST: I do not think you are funny .
MAX: Where the hell is my bomb ?
SHORT SCIENTIST: You do not get it till I get the money .
MAX: For a guy who 's all about transcending materialism , you talk about money so much !
SHORT SCIENTIST: If you keep talking , Pop-Amm will cut your mouth out of your face .
MAX: Fine
POOCH: She burned us , Clay .
CLAY: I know
POOCH: The whole op is compromised-
CLAY: I know .
JENSEN: Hey , fallen comrade here ! Blood flowing out of his body
SMALLER VOICE: Precious , precious blood
CLAY: Cougar ?
JENSEN: What 's that for ?
POOCH: So we split up again . Right ?
ROQUE: Pooch
POOCH: Goddammit , Clay , whatever she knows , Max knows ! It 's over !
CLAY: Okay . We split up . Some of us should go international . I 'll do that if nobody else wants to-
ROQUE: So we just run again ?
CLAY: There 's nothing else we can do
ROQUE: There 's something we can do .
CLAY: Excuse me ?
ROQUE: Three years is enough . If there 's a drive at that port that we can use to get clear-
CLAY: What part of `` he knows we 're coming for it '' do you not get ? They 're gon na be waiting for us . Par-Sec is gon na waiting for us
ROQUE: So figure out a way around them ; you 're good at that shit , Clay !
TO CLAY: To steal them back . And I 'm prepared to do anything to any one to make that happen .
CLAY: Pooch , what 's the minimum time to scout the patrols , get an accurate head count on-site at the Port ?
POOCH: 48 hours , but Aisha knows that-
CLAY: So we hit them in twelve .
POOCH: Twelve hours from now ? You mean you want us to go in blind ?
ROQUE: Last thing they 'll expect
POOCH: Yeah , cause it 's dumb .
CLAY: Jensen 's already got the layout , and Cougar can spot on site . Right ?
JENSEN: Yeah , cause gettin ' shot is awesome , I 'm totally up for doing it again
CLAY: Pooch ?
POOCH: Last time we went in blind on an op , we lost everything
CLAY: So ?
POOCH: So let 's go get it back .
CLAY: You ready ?
ROQUE: I 'm ready .
CLAY: We 're in . Status .
POOCH: The Pooch is good .
COUGAR: Squelch .
CLAY: Jensen , we 're coming . You ready ?
JENSEN: And the crowd goes wild
CLAY: Roque and I will set the charges here but we wo n't detonate until you have the drive .
ROQUE: You ca n't settle for stealing the drive , you got ta blow up Goliath 's shit too .
CLAY: What can I say , I hold a grudge .
TO JENSEN: Get gone .
POOCH: Wade 's here .
CLAY: Are you kidding me ?
JENSEN: I 'm above the computer room , maybe thirty seconds from the drive
CLAY: Something 's not right . Something
ROQUE: I think you should see this .
CLAY: You think Aisha ?
ROQUE: No . Not Aisha .
POOCH: Jensen , you get it ? Jensen ?
WADE: Hello , Clay . Been awhile .
NODDING: Roque .
CLAY: When ?
ROQUE: After the truck . I got tired of waiting for you to save us , so I up and saved myself . Reached out like I said and cut a deal - I set this up , I go free .
CLAY: Traitor
ROQUE: You gave me no choice . It was always gon na end like this , Clay . Us captured or dead . It was always a dead end . You made sure of it .
CLAY: Bullshit
ROQUE: Not bullshit . You were gon na keep planning missions and ways to hit Max until it got us all killed .
CLAY: No
ROQUE: Yes , Clay . Yes . Only difference with this situation is at least I get to walk away .
CLAY: We all could have walked used the drive
ROQUE: Do n't you get it yet ? There is no drive . There never was
MORE: 103 .
CLAY: Kill me now Maybe you live through this .
WADE: Oh , we 're not gon na kill you . Someone 's got ta get away with the cash . Your crew ? I 'm definitely wasting them . But you ?
CHUCKLING: Max really does love to frame you
TO ROQUE: I 'll see you at Turner Airfield .
ROQUE: Wait .
CLAY: You 're going to die very badly . The guards hustle Clay out the door
LEAD GUARD: On your knees .
POOCH: Get on with it
LEAD GUARD: That 's a nice hat .
NOTICING: What are you smiling at ?
JENSEN: Should n't have gone after the hat
POOCH: I 've been shot in both legs , what kind of dumbass question is that ?
JENSEN: Oh , so we 're Mr. Grumpy now ? You 're not the only one who 's been shot ecently , you know !
AISHA: Did you kill my father ? Jensen comes running up , interrupting
JENSEN: Clay ?
CLAY: Kind of in the middle of something here , Jensen-
AISHA: Did you kill him ?
JENSEN: There was no drive , Clay-
JENSEN: There was no drive and Roque 's gone and Par-Sec 's regrouping and Pooch could bleed out-
AISHA: Did you kill him ?
JENSEN: Okay , excellent , very tribalWe need to go .
CLAY: Can you stand ?
POOCH: This is stupid question day , is n't it ? It 's stupid question day and someone forgot to tell me
CLAY: Let 's go .
POOCH: Way it always goes .
COUGAR: Where to , Colonel ?
WADE: Your friends jack-rabbitted . Should we be worried ?
ROQUE: Clay does n't take risks . It 's why I 'm here and he 's not .
WADE: You 're sure ?
ROQUE: They were good guys .
WADE: No such thing . I 'll go call Max .
CLAY: Hi , Wade !
ROQUE: Declan , start the plane
POOCH: Next time , remind me - car crash first , then get shot
JENSEN: Sounds less painful that way
CLAY: Cougar and I are going after that plane . The rest of you , get Wade .
JENSEN: Me and legless Pooch are on it !
POOCH: You call me legless Pooch again , you 're gon na be Headless Jensen .
JENSEN: What , it 's a cool name ! It makes you sound like a pirate ! Fine , let 's go kill Wade
PILOT: We do n't have enough runway to take off - we 're going to have to turn around and come back to get up to speed !
ROQUE: Fine , just get us in the air !
CLAY: I 'm out .
JENSEN: Yoo-hoo ! Wade ! Come out and plaaaayyy-
ROQUE: Got ta admit , I always wondered how this would play out .
CLAY: Aisha thinks you kill me .
ROQUE: It 's a distinct possibility
CLAY: Do n't need one .
ROQUE: Bit of as longshot for you
CLAY: No . It 's not .
ROQUE: Now I really am gon na cut you head off
CLAY: SHIT-
JENSEN: Not to rain on everyone 's we killed all the bad guys parade , but we should probably get gone - legless Pooch has a Learjet all gassed up for us in the Hangar . It 's a cool name-
CLAY: Hello ?
MAX: We good ?
CLAY: Not by a longshot . You 're not having a real great day , Max .
MAX: Who is this ?
CLAY: Just a voice on the phone .
MAX: Where 's Wade ?
CLAY: Working on the engines .
MAX: Clay .
CLAY: It 's Colonel .
MAX: Colonel , yes . Well done .
CLAY: Thank you .
MAX: I understand you 've always wanted to meet face to face . I 'm sure that could be arranged
CLAY: I do n't think the guys you 're about to stiff for a billion dollars are going to allow that to happen . We win . You lose . Goodbye .
POOCH: Ready when you are .
AISHA: I wanted to find and punish those esponsible for my father 's death . Max , his men , everyone .
CLAY: That why you slept with me ?
AISHA: That and the cardio .
CLAY: You coming ?

LENA: What 'd you do ?

CAMILLE: I do n't know why I keep hoping you 'll grow out of this tomboy thing .
MONICA: I wo n't . I 'm a lesbian . Lena chokes on her drink , cracks up .
CAMILLE: That 's not funny
MONICA: Well , that 's what you think , is n't it ? Cause I 'd rather wear a jersey than an apron
CAMILLE: Watch your mouth .
NATHAN: Monica , I think her point ismaybe it 's time to start thinking about other things esides basketball .

JIM: But you 'd love for him to play at USC , like you did .
ZEKE: I 'd love for him to get a good education . That 's it .
QUINCY: Pop , there 's no way an Ivy League Team is going all the way .
ZEKE: I do n't care about the team . I care about the school .
QUINCY: Did n't we already have this conversation ? Zeke sighs , then
ZEKE: You played good . I was proud of you . Quincy smiles wide .
QUINCY: Yeah ? So you up for a game later ?

QUINCY: Big-ass titties ?
MONICA: `` Q. I think you are so fine and I 've een wanting to get with you . Let me take you to the Spring Dance and I promise I 'll leave you satisfied . '' Monica laughs in disbelief . MONICA What a ho .
QUINCY: Why she got ta be a ho , just cause she wants to get with me .
MONICA: She 's a ho cause she 's sending he coochie through the mail .
QUINCY: And ?
MONICA: And ? She 's not saying , `` I think you 're a nice guy and I wan na get to know you etter , '' she 's saying , `` I wan na bone . ''
QUINCY: So she 's honest .
MONICA: Yeah , an honest tramp-ass ho . But I guess you 'll stick your dick in anything .
QUINCY: Did n't know you cared so much .
MONICA: I do n't .
QUINCY: So who you going to the dance with , Spalding ?
MONICA: Who 's Spalding ?
QUINCY: See , that 's why you ai n't getting ecruited .
MONICA: Who said I 'm not getting recruited ?
QUINCY: Your hot-ass temper . Monica points to the scar on her cheek .
MONICA: I 'm not the one who put this scar here .
QUINCY: God , here we go .
MONICA: When we were eleven years old cause he was about to lose . Quincy turns , faces her .
QUINCY: That 's it , give it your best shot .
MONICA: Would you watch the damn road ?
QUINCY: I mean it , give it your best shot , cause I 'm tired of you holding that over my head .
MONICA: I 'm warning you , do n't tempt me .
QUINCY: I 'm warning you . You do n't stall that ad attitude , no one 's gon na recruit you . Quincy pulls his Jeep into his driveway .
MONICA: Please , you jump in some guy 's face , talk smack and you get a pat on your ass . But ecause I 'm a female , I get told to calm down and act like a `` lady '' . I 'm a allplayer , okay . A ball player .

QUINCY: Uh , your earring ?
NONA: I look like some hoochie to you ? I found it on your floor .
QUINCY: What are you doing in my room ? Quincy crosses into
NONA: Quincy , I told you about these fat-ass girls .
QUINCY: We were just studying .
NONA: I 'm not playing with you , these girls are looking to get you caught . They see you , they see dollar signs .
QUINCY: Okay .
NONA: You hearing me ?
QUINCY: I 've been hearing you .
NONA: How was your game ?
QUINCY: Twenty-seven points , eleven assists and still undefeated .
NONA: Still the man .
QUINCY: Yup . Nona smiles , starts back the kitchen .
NONA: Where 's your dad ?
QUINCY: Said he 'd be home later .
NONA: Later when ?
QUINCY: I do n't know , he had a meeting o something . Quincy exits to his room .
ZEKE: I had some players to see and hands to shake .
NONA: At one in the morning ?
ZEKE: I 'm not gon na get anywhere punching a clock just so my wife does n't get an attitude .
NONA: I came second to the NBA . I 'm not about to come second to this bullshit scouting job . Zeke looks at her , offended . NONA I did n't mean it like that .
ZEKE: Yeah .
NONA: I 'm just saying it 'd be nice if you found time for your family . You should see the tramps coming afte Quincy . If you do n't talk to him
ZEKE: I have . A beat .
NONA: You said you 'd think about going back to get your degree .
ZEKE: No , you said I should get my degree . I like my `` bullshit '' job , okay , and it 's gon na lead to a spot in the front office . Til then , do n't worry , there 's just enough savings to keep your ass in Gucci and gold .
NONA: Fine , then how many nights home is that ?
ZEKE: Keep your voice down .
NONA: How about now ? I got a week yet ?
LENA: That too tight ?
MONICA: No .
LENA: Mom 's going to hate it .
MONICA: Always on my ass , anyway .
LENA: Like you do n't give her a hard time .
MONICA: Just cause I do n't kiss her booty like you Lena yanks Monica 's head back . MONICA Ow ! ! !
LENA: You need to . She 's alone in this house all day , taking care of Dad and you ungrateful behind .
MONICA: No one 's forcing her .

LENA: I told him you looked like me .
MONICA: Oh , great .
LENA: You do .
MONICA: Yeah , right .
LENA: If you were tore up I would not be claiming you . Trust . Monica is not convinced . LENA We 'll do something cute with your hair , get you a dress , get you some heels
MONICA: I do n't know how to walk in heels .
LENA: Hey . You just worry about playing you ehind off for that recruiter tonight . Let me worry about your date .
MONICA: You ever been in love ?

CAMILLE: Monica , please . Monica stops .
MONICA: Sorry . I 'm leaving .
CAMILLE: Taste this .
MONICA: I ca n't eat before a game .
CAMILLE: Child , take a bite . Monica sighs , takes a bite . It 's good . CAMILLE I found some apricot chutney and mixed it with the yams .
MONICA: You really should be a caterer o something like you used to say .
CAMILLE: Sure . In between all the other things I have to do .
MONICA: What ?
CAMILLE: Nothing . So good luck .
COACH HISERMAN: I do n't have to tell you girls how big this game is . We worked too damn hard all season to leave without this championship . So let 's play smart let 's play in control , and let 's kick some butt . Cougars on three . Oncetwothree .
TEAM: Cougars !
REFEREE: Reaching in , number thirty-two . One-and- one . Boos fill the gym . Monica 's eyes widen .
MONICA: No !
COACH HISERMAN: Monica !
MONICA: I do n't even want to go . She steps back , looks at her work .
LENA: Mom ! Beat , then Camille enters .
CAMILLE: Go in my top drawer and get my pearls . Lena exits . Monica still looks miserable . CAMILLE You okay ? Monica shrugs . CAMILLE Well , can you promise me one thing ?
MONICA: What ?
CAMILLE: Tonight , do n't worry about yesterday 's game , the recruiters , or anything else . I just want you to enjoy being beautiful . Will you do that ?
LENA: Here .
MONICA: You really think I look beautiful ?
JASON: Can I take your coat ?
MONICA: You 're cold ? Monica starts to pull it off .
JASON: No , I mean I can check it for you .
MONICA: Oh , sorry .
JASON: Your sister was n't lying .
QUINCY: Ohshit .
SHAWNEE: Q , I like this song
QUINCY: See you made it .
MONICA: Yeah .
QUINCY: You do n't look half-bad .
MONICA: You either .
JASON: What 's up , Black . I 'm Jason .
QUINCY: Q .
SHAWNEE: Dang , girl , I did n't know Nike made dresses .
MONICA: Guess we 'll see you later .
JASON: So , you like school ? Monica smiles nervously , nods . JASON Yeah , high school was cool . I do n't emember sisters being as fine as you , though . Monica just holds that nervous smile . JASON So what do you like studying ?
MONICA: Gym . He waits for more , but nothing comes .
JASON: I 'm an English major . You like English ?
MONICA: Sort of .
JASON: Careful .
MONICA: Huh ?
JASON: That was two words .
MONICA: Sorry .
JASON: I mean , I 'm having a good time with you
MONICA: My mouth is kinda dry .
JASON: Then I 'll get you some punch . He stands , then . JASON Just do n't jet while I 'm gone and leave a glass slipper behind . Monica 's face lights up . Jason smiles . JASON There we go .
QUINCY: Hey .
MONICA: Hey .
QUINCY: You having fun ?
MONICA: Yeah .
QUINCY: Yeah , the DJ 's kinda whack , though . So who is this clown ?
MONICA: He ai n't Spalding .
QUINCY: Guess not .
MONICA: So you took Shawnee , huh ?
QUINCY: You know , it was late and she asked
JASON: You want to dance ?
MONICA: Sure .
QUINCY: C'mon . He pulls Shawnee to the middle of the floor .
MONICA: Freshman year , my free throw percentage was fifty-one percent , cause I was shooting it like a jump shot . Jason leans in , kisses her bare shoulder . MONICA Umbut then sophomore year I was shooting seventy-five percent from the line . Jason kisses her neck . MONICA uh , by keeping my feet set and really following through .
JASON: That was nice .
MONICA: Uh-huh .
JASON: Your sister told me hands off , but I ca n't help myself
MONICA: Wait
JASON: Shh . It 's okay .
MONICA: Psst .
QUINCY: I was about to ask you the same thing , going out with a college boy and all . Monica does n't respond . QUINCY So where 'd you go after ?
MONICA: Mulholland Drive .
QUINCY: Figures .
MONICA: So what dead-end street did you and Shawnee hit ?
QUINCY: None of your business .
MONICA: Well , I 'm sure she kept her word and left you satisfied .
QUINCY: That what you think ? Monica shrugs . QUINCY Little after you left , I told Shawnee it was time to go and I drove her ass straight home . And after she told me I was the dumbest brother in the world , I took off .
MONICA: Why ?
QUINCY: Cause I do n't just stick my dick in anything . Monica takes this in .
MONICA: I was sitting in Jason 's ride with him kissing on me and feeling on me and it was really bugging me cause I could n't emember how many offensive boards I had in the championship . And then I guess she got tired of me sort of accidentally kneeing him in the balls .
QUINCY: Four .
MONICA: What ?
QUINCY: You had four offensive rebounds . Monica stares at him , surprised . She thinks .
MONICA: Hold up for a second .
QUINCY: When 'd you get this ?
MONICA: It was on my bed when I came in . Can you just ?
QUINCY: You sure ?
MONICA: I knew it .
QUINCY: What was that about ?
MONICA: I know , right ?
QUINCY: You want to stop ?
COACH MILLER: I do n't know some of you very well yet , and you do n't know me because I 'm still eing nice to you . Laughter from the upperclassmen . COACH MILLER But my philosophy is simple . Hard work and sacrifice . There 's a lot of basketball history and pride here at USC , but just putting on the cardinal and gold does n't make you a great player . Hard work and sacrifice makes you a great player . What you were does n't matter anymore . For the first time in your life , you wo n't be the best . You 'll be going up against women that are igger and stronger and better than you ever imagined . So the question is , how will you respond ? Well , your answe etter be hard work and sacrifice because that 's the only way you 're gon na make it through . Vince Lombardi preached it and I teach it , `` There is only one way to succeed at anything and that is to give everything . ''
SIDRA: That 's right , Coach .
COACH MILLER: By the end of this year some of you will hate me The upperclassmen crack up . COACH MILLER Some of you will want to go home
UPPERCLASSMEN: Cree !
COACH MILLER: But I guarantee you , if you work hard and sacrifice , all of you will be bette asketball players and better people . Monica nods , accepting the challenge .
SIDRA: Dag , you took her out , T. Teammates SANDRA and LISA crack up .
SANDRA: I think she just said `` Mommy . ''
LISA: No , she said `` mammary . ''
COACH MILLER: Monica , you trying to tell me you ca n't take a little challenge ? Monica crawls to her feet .
MONICA: I can take it .
COACH MILLER: This time get your feet set .
SIDRA: You got it , c'mon , lift ! Monica lifts it with Sidra 's help . SIDRA That 's it .
MONICA: Coach hates me , does n't she ?
SIDRA: She hates all freshmen . Monica scowls , discouraged .
MONICA: What 's up with that ?
SIDRA: Hey , do n't take it personal . And do n't think just cause we play the same position we have to compete with each other . We 're teammates , okay ?
MONICA: Thanks , Sidra .
SIDRA: Besides . I 've been starting point the last two years . Ai n't no way some dumb- ass freshman is taking my spot .
MONICA: You finish the reading for E-con ?
QUINCY: Yeah .
MONICA: What 'd it say ?
QUINCY: Basically broke down how I 'm gon na make mad loot in the NBA , me being such a limited commodity and all .
MONICA: Whatever , big head . Quincy laughs . TWO GIRLS pass by , smile .
GIRL #1: Hey , Q-man , you gon na take us to the Final Four ?
QUINCY: We 'll see .
GIRL #2: We 'll be watching .
QUINCY: What ?
MONICA: You do see me standing here , right ?
QUINCY: I ca n't be nice to a fan ?
MONICA: Fine , Quincy .
QUINCY: I ca n't help girls coming up to me .
MONICA: I said fine .
QUINCY: It 's okay , little baby .
MONICA: Quit .
QUINCY: Shhh . Daddy 's here . Monica finally cracks up .
MONICA: You 're such a punk . He gives her a kiss .
QUINCY: All these girlsyou 're the only one I know who 's for real . Monica smiles , kisses him back .
MONICA: Always .
COACH MILLER: Sidra ! You feel like playing any `` D '' ?
MONICA: What ?
COACH MILLER: You love to pose so much , let 's see it again .
MONICA: Coach
COACH MILLER: I want you to stand like that until you 're sick of it because I do n't eve want to see it again , you hear me ? Dora , take her spot .
LISA: Z , I know you 're gon na shower first .
ZVETTE: I do n't smell bad .
SANDRA: And you wonder why your ass sits alone on the bus .
CREE: You guys curse too much .
SANDRA: Since when is `` ass '' a curse ? MAEYEN walks past .
MAEYEN: Whoa , it 's as big as yours .
SIDRA: That 's what you get for trying to show out , freshman .
MONICA: I was just playing ball .
SIDRA: You were trying to make me look bad .
MONICA: Did n't have to try very hard .
SIDRA: Girl , do n't you know you 're just sloppy seconds ? Monica rises .
MONICA: What ? Toni tries to step in .
TONI: Sidra , let it go .
SIDRA: Only reason you 're here is cause Tonya Randall got pregnant and decided not to come . They were done recruiting . KELLI , senior forward , shakes her head .
KELLI: That 's cold , Sid .
SIDRA: Just thought the girl should know .
SHAYLA: Do n't even trip . She 's just mad cause she 's bow-legged .
QUINCY: Forget Tonya Randall .
MONICA: I 'm telling you , Coach wishes she was here instead of me .
QUINCY: Then prove her wrong .
MONICA: I do n't have it easy like you , alright . There 's no red carpet laid out for me .
QUINCY: So you 're gon na act salty all night ?
REGGIE: Yo , dog , we 're about to order some wings .
QUINCY: Nah , thanks .
MONICA: That was so weak .
QUINCY: Who cares if you 're never known as the first girl in the NBA . You 'll get more play behind Quincy McCall 's woman anyway .
MONICA: That 's what you get .
QUINCY: So how about a little one-on-one ?
MONICA: What are we playing for ?
QUINCY: Clothes .
MONICA: What ?
QUINCY: I score , you strip . You score , I drop something . Monica looks at him , then cracks up .
MONICA: Give me the ball .
QUINCY: My court , I go first .
MONICA: Kiss my booty .
QUINCY: Plan to .
MONICA: All 's fair in love and basketball . Strip .
QUINCY: Oh , my bad .
MONICA: Yo , where 's the `` D '' ?
QUINCY: Right here .
MONICA: I won .
QUINCY: I wanted you to . Game over . They hit it .
DICK VITALE: It 's the start of the new college season and I 'm like a kid in a candy store . Too many great teams to choose from . You have your Dukes ' , Kentuckys ' , Arkansas ' , ut my surprise treat this season
ROBIN ROBERTS: USC . The women of Troy made it to the Sweet Sixteen last year and are returning four starters from that squad . And many consider their recruiting class one of the best in the nation . The highlight of that class ,
DICK VITALE: is Quincy McCall , one of my diape dandies . He 's a real P.T.P. , a prime- time player . Every college in the country wanted him but he chose to follow in his father 's footsteps and become a Trojan . He 's gon na have a lot on his shoulders this season
ROBIN ROBERTS: but Coach Cheryl Miller feels that if just one of her freshmen has a breakout year , they can go all the way . It 's a long season , anything can happen , but one thing is for sure
DICK VITALE: It 's gon na be awesome , baby !
QUINCY: up and under between two defenders , with the left hand . That 's got ta make SportsCenter .
TERRY: What are you having , Zeke ?
ZEKE: Genuine Draft . And an orange juice fo my kid .
TERRY: Cross-over 's looking good , Quincy . I know your old man did n't teach you that .
ZEKE: Did n't need a cross-over to post you up .
QUINCY: You know , the numbers I 'm putting up are etter than any freshman . Some people are saying I 'm a definite lottery pick . Zeke suddenly focuses .
ZEKE: What people ?
QUINCY: You know , people .
ZEKE: Well , tell them to mind their damn usiness . You 're smart enough to get a degree .
QUINCY: I 'm also good enough to go pro .
ZEKE: You know how much higher the play level is in the NBA ? Give yourself time to develop , Quincy . Get an education . The NBA ai n't going nowhere .
QUINCY: You came out early .
ZEKE: Your mom got pregnant and I had to make choices . You do n't have a choice .
QUINCY: Okay Silence , then .
ZEKE: Besides , the sooner you go pro , the sooner you 'll have to deal with the mess I 'm dealing with .
QUINCY: What mess ?
ZEKE: there 's this thing out there . This paternity suit .
QUINCY: What ?
ZEKE: Some girl that 's been hanging on at every party . now I 'm supposed to be her baby 's Daddy . Anyway , I told your mom I wanted to be the one who told you .
QUINCY: Tell me what ?
ZEKE: I just told you .
QUINCY: I mean , it 's not true , is it ? Zeke stares at his son .
ZEKE: You got the balls to ask me that ?
QUINCY: Sorry .
ZEKE: No , you need to hear me say it , I 'll say it . It 's not true .
QUINCY: So what are you gon na do ?
ZEKE: I want this thing to go to court , but my lawyer 's telling me to settle .
QUINCY: Why ?
ZEKE: A case like this could hang around fo months and I 'm up for this playe elations job with the `` Clips . '' This gets out , false or not , no one 'll touch me .
QUINCY: What 's Mom think ?
ZEKE: We have n't exactly been living the fairy- tale life the past few years . Something like this happens , it either brings a family closer or pushes them furthe apart . We 'll just have to see how it plays out . I 'm giving her some space , couple days Just then , a COLLEGE STUDENT approaches .
COLLEGE STUDENT: Yo , Q-man , great game .
QUINCY: Thanks .
COLLEGE STUDENT: Can I get an autograph ?
NONA: You scared me .
QUINCY: Sorry . You okay ?
NONA: I 'm fine . Quincy glances at her half-hidden glass .
QUINCY: Last time I remember you drinking was when Marvin Gaye died . No response from Nona . QUINCY This about Dad ?
NONA: Guess he talked to you .
QUINCY: Do n't sweat it , okay . Sooner or late the truth 'll come out .
NONA: Whose truth are you talking about ?
QUINCY: Mom , we ca n't let something like this mess up the family . She does n't respond . Quincy studies her . QUINCY I mean , you believe him , right ? Nona sits silent , humiliated . QUINCY Mom ?
NONA: Justleave it alone .
QUINCY: This is just about money , you know that .
NONA: Quincy , please
QUINCY: I mean , how many times have you told me yourself to watch out for these ho 's ?
NONA: Guess I should have been telling you father .
QUINCY: So you 're gon na take the word of some trick over Pop 's ? He would n't lie .
NONA: I hired somebody . How pathetic is that ? After all his late nights and `` meetings '' and I still needed proof . Quincy just stares at the photos . NONA I used to think I was lucky just to be married to Zeke McCall , but I 'm too tired .
QUINCY: Do n't put your hands in your pockets , hold your head up , always look a man in the eye , and all the time I 'm hanging on his every word like he 's God o something
MONICA: I know he messed up , but that does n't change what he 's been to you .
QUINCY: What has he been to me ? I mean , he looked me in my face and lied like it was nothing . Like it was easy . And I 'm standing there getting loud on my mom like she 's the one with no sense
MONICA: She understands .
QUINCY: He even had me wanting to play for the `` Clippers . '' Man , how stupid am I .
MONICA: You 're not stupid .
QUINCY: I know a lot of brothers dog their wives , I just never thought my pops would do some shit like this
MONICA: Nothing . Why do n't we walk to my dorm ?
QUINCY: I 'm not up for running into anybody . Let 's just kick it here , alright ?
MONICA: Ica n't .
QUINCY: Why not ?
MONICA: Coach has us on eleven o'clock curfew . If I 'm late , I do n't suit up . Quincy looks at her , almost in shock .
QUINCY: Did n't realize you were watching the clock .
MONICA: I mean , I can stay a few more minutes .
QUINCY: Nah . Do n't sweat it .
MONICA: Quincy
QUINCY: For real . I should be alone , anyway . Monica reluctantly stands .
MONICA: Will you call me when you get in ?
SHAYLA: Go to sleep .
MONICA: You should have seen him , Shay
SHAYLA: Mon , Sidra 's out for one game , and you got the start . But you get caught eaking curfew and Coach is gon na send your ass back to the bench . You 'll see your man tomorrow .
ANNOUNCER: And now the starting line-up for you Women of Troy ! At center , a senior , Toni Noise !
TONI: Look y'all , we got all these people here to see big-bad , La Tech . We need to let them know that this is our house . So everybody better leave everything out on that floor , you got that ? Ready ? One , two , three .
TEAM: Team !
COACH MILLER: That 's it , that 's it !
REFEREE: Offensive foul ! Charging ! No basket !
MAEYEN: Shoot , you see that crowd ? We need to be playing in the Sports Arena .
KELLI: Hell yeah . They give each other a pound .
LISA: Oh damn , Mon .
MONICA: What ?
LISA: I think ol ' girl took out your chi-chis with that charge .
MONICA: Kiss my ass .
SANDRA: Nah , I think she took that too .
MONICA: Sandra , please , last time you chest- umped me , it took you three tries .
TONI: I do n't want to go play overseas .
DORA: I thought you were hyped about going to Portugal next year .
TONI: It 's never gon na be like this . Playing in front of my family , hanging out with my girls . Probably not even a McDonald 's .
SANDRA: Nah , there 's always a McDonald 's .
SIDRA: Least you got an offer . My agent 's still looking .
CREE: What about you ?
LISA: Maybe it 'd be worth it if I knew some day I could come back here and play . But fo ight now , it 's law school .
COACH MILLER: You could 've given up after you threw that ball away . But you kept your head and you showed real heart .
MONICA: Thanks .
COACH MILLER: We 've got our final games against Oregon and Oregon State and I want to shake things up a bit , so I 'm starting you at point again .
MONICA: I thought Sidra 's ankle was okay for next game .
COACH MILLER: You want the job or not ? Realization finally hits .
MONICA: Yeah . Yes .
COACH MILLER: What ?
MONICA: It 's justit seems like you 're always yelling at me .
COACH MILLER: You think I 'd go hoarse for a player with no potential ? When I ignore you , that 's when you worry . Go get dressed . Monica nods , crosses out .
SHAYLA: Yo sis , what 's going on ? Beat , then Monica smiles .
GIRL'S VOICE: Yo , great game .
MONICA: Thanks . Another PARTY-GOER grabs her arm .
REGGIE: What 's up , girl .

MONICA: I 've been trying to find you all day .
QUINCY: Here I am . She glances at the forty in his hand .
MONICA: Sorry about your game .
QUINCY: It happens , right Shayla suddenly grabs Monica from behind .
SHAYLA: What 's up , superstar . Your girl was on tonight . She tell you ?
QUINCY: I heard .
SHAYLA: She also tell you she ganked the starting spot from Sidra ? Monica looks at him for a reaction .
QUINCY: Nah . He downs the last of his forty . QUINCY Where 's the keg at ?
SHAYLA: Balcony .
REGGIE: What 's up , dog ? Hey , flyness .
SHAYLA: Get off the bra strap , Reggie , you 're a ho . He laughs , then turns back to Quincy .
REGGIE: Coach is gon na kill us in practice tomorrow . Might even pull his lips off your dick , limp as your game was tonight . Quincy just looks at him .
QUINCY: That 's funny . Monica leans against Quincy , affectionately .
MONICA: he 's just playing , Q
QUINCY: You think for once we could talk about something besides basketball ?
SHAYLA: Sure .
REGGIE: Whatever 's clever .
MONICA: Y'all need to quit . She starts for Quincy
SIDRA: Just wanted to say good game .
MONICA: But ?
SIDRA: No buts . Took a lot of heart to take that charge .
MONICA: Thanks .
SIDRA: But that was a dumb-ass pass to Toni . Ten seconds left , you run out the clock . Monica shakes her head . An awkward silence . SIDRA I 'd be lying if I said I was n't pissed .
MONICA: I know .
SIDRA: Just one word of advice for next season .
MONICA: What 's that ?
SIDRA: Never let a freshman take your spot . Sidra turns and walks away .
KERRY: Excuse me .
QUINCY: Excuse me .
KERRY: If that 's the last beer , you and I are sharing .
QUINCY: Guess you did n't see the game .
KERRY: Kerry .
QUINCY: Q .
KERRY: I know .
MONICA: Who was that ?
QUINCY: Nobody .
MONICA: Who 's nobody ?
QUINCY: Look , this party 's whack . You ready to go ?
MONICA: You want to go talk ?
QUINCY: Not really .
MONICA: We could finish what we were talking about last night . Quincy kisses her again . MONICA
QUINCY: You know what , I 'm just gon na crash .
MONICA: FineMaybe I 'll come by later .
QUINCY: Nah . I have curfew . He starts to walk away , then stops . QUINCY Oh , by the way . Congratulations . He goes . Monica stares after him .
ZEKE: Your door was unlocked .
QUINCY: Still is , so let yourself out .
ZEKE: We need to talk .
QUINCY: We ai n't got nothing to talk about .
ZEKE: I messed up , okay , I know that . But I ai n't that kid 's father .
QUINCY: Lucky kid .
ZEKE: Look , I ai n't saying it was right , but sometimes things happen .
QUINCY: And some things should never fucking happen !
ZEKE: Boy , you 're so perfect you can look down on me ?
QUINCY: I ai n't a damn liar .
ZEKE: Your mom was real quick to show you those pictures , was n't she ? Well , she was nineteen when she got pregnant and do n't get me wrong , you 're the best thing in my life , but she knew I was n't ready for no marriage .
QUINCY: So now you 're saying my mother trapped you ?
ZEKE: I 'm saying I handled my responsibilities like a man . But when you 're in the NBA , you pull into a city and there 's a hundred women waiting at the hotel . And another twenty that made it past security on your floor . And the boldest one is standing right at your door . And afte awhile , it just becomes part of the game . I 'm sorry I lied to you , I should n't have . But I did it cause I love you .
QUINCY: Since we 're being honest , guess I should tell you . I 'm dropping out of school and going pro .
ZEKE: What ? Quincy just stares back . ZEKE Quincy , you 'd be making the biggest mistake of your life .
QUINCY: From your mouth .
ZEKE: I know your mad at me , okay , but I ca n't let you do this .
QUINCY: Always thought `` ca n't '' was n't in a man 's vocabulary .
MONICA: Hey , y'all .
QUINCY: Hey , what 's up .
MONICA: You were n't at my game .
QUINCY: Yeah , sorry about that . I had this meeting with this guy . Quincy pulls on the T-shirt . QUINCY You win ?
MONICA: Yeah , I hit a three at the buzzer .
QUINCY: The `` man '' again .
MONICA: Woman A knock at the front door . Quincy exits .
QUINCY: Hey , you .
KERRY: Hi .
QUINCY: Oh , Kerry , this is Monica . Monica , Kerry .
MONICA: What the hell 's going on ?
QUINCY: We 're going to get some food .
MONICA: Are you out of your mind ?
KERRY: Maybe I should come back ?
MONICA: No . You stay , I 'll leave . She storms out .
CAMILLE: Monica . What are you doing here ?
MONICA: Did n't know I needed a reason to come home .
CAMILLE: Do n't be defensive . I 'm just surprised to see you .
MONICA: Dad around ?
CAMILLE: He 's still at the bank . Monica glowers . Camille looks at her . CAMILLE Everything okay ?
MONICA: Yeah .
CAMILLE: Well , I 'm going to get dinner . She pulls open her car door . Beat , then CAMILLE It 's just a game .
MONICA: What ?
CAMILLE: Whenever you lose , you get this attitude . But it 's just a game . Monica rolls her eyes , as her mom leaves .
QUINCY: Can we talk ?
MONICA: Talk to your new girlfriend .
QUINCY: I just took the ho to Burger King , alright .
MONICA: Cheap date .
QUINCY: Least she had time for me .
MONICA: So you fucked around to prove a point !
QUINCY: I just said I did n't fuck around . But you got your head so far up your ass it took a cheap date for you to notice me .
MONICA: What , `` Q-man '' , did I forget to kiss you ass like everybody else ?
QUINCY: You forgot to be there .
MONICA: That night you wanted to talk about you Dad I had a curfew . What was I supposed to do ?
QUINCY: Stay !
MONICA: If I stayed , I would n't be starting !
QUINCY: Least you got your priorities straight .
MONICA: I never asked you to choose .
QUINCY: Never had to .
MONICA: I 'm a ballplayer . If anyone knows what that means it should be you .
QUINCY: Well , if all you care about is asketball , why you fucking me ? Go fuck Dick Vitale .
MONICA: How do I know next time you 're feeling neglected or whatever , you 're not going to run around on me ? If we 're going to e together I have to be able to trust you .
QUINCY: I 'm not asking for us to be together . Monica flinches in shock .
MONICA: What ?
QUINCY: I 'm going through a lot of shit right now , more than you have time for .
MONICA: How are you going to tell me what I have time for ? I mean , whatever I didwe can fix this .
QUINCY: I do n't think so .
MONICA: You do n't think so ?
QUINCY: Look , I 'm entering the draft .
MONICA: You 're what ?
QUINCY: I decided to go pro . And who knows where I 'll end up , you know ? Monica 's heart is sinking fast .
MONICA: When did you decide all this ?
QUINCY: Few days ago .
MONICA: So that 's it , just forget about us ?
QUINCY: Damnitt , Monica . This ai n't about us anymore , it 's about me .
MONICA: Friends .
QUINCY: SoI guess I 'll see you around .
MONICA: Uh huh .
LITTLE GIRLS: Baloncesto ! Balencesto !
MONICA: Oye .
LITTLE GIRLS: Autografo .
LUISA: Monica . What is up ?
MONICA: Oye , Luisa .
LUISA: Large game , no ?
MONICA: Si . Large game . They duck into the arena .
COACH PARRA: Silenco !
MONICA: What did he say ?
LUISA: He say to give the ball to you .
SIDRA: Well , what do you know .
MONICA: What 's up , Sidra .
SIDRA: I 'm gon na love winning this championship in your house .
MONICA: How do you say `` you 're dreaming '' in Italian ?
SIDRA: Can you take that damn thing off the table .
MONICA: You mean my championship trophy ? My bad .
SIDRA: Still a cocky bitch .
MONICA: Uno mas , por favor . The waiter nods . MONICA Last I heard , you were playing in Sweden .
SIDRA: Yeah , four years ago . They had me staying in this tiny-ass town with like fifty people . I 'm not playing , there was about a thousand goats running around , and it gets dark at four o'clock . Then the whack club I 'm on loses three games in a row and I get blamed . So they fire me .
MONICA: Just like that ?
SIDRA: Yup . So I 've been playing with this Italian club the last three years .
MONICA: How 's that been ?
SIDRA: It 's better . Even though the whole first season my teammates did n't pass to me cause they were mad `` The American '' was making more money . I led the team in rebounds cause it was the only way I could touch the damn ball .
MONICA: Please , I went through the same drama as everybody else . I mean , the first fou months , only person I could talk to was this chick Luisa , who knew like ten words of English from watching old `` Dif'rent Strokes '' reruns . Swear to God , I had to tell her if she said , `` What you talking out , Willis ? '' one more time , I was gon na kick her ass .
SIDRA: So what are these Spanish guys like ?
MONICA: I would n't know .
SIDRA: What ? You 've been over here seven months and you ai n't tapped anything ?
MONICA: Just not my type , I guess .
SIDRA: Shoot , Italian boys love them some black women . They ca n't get enough of me . Monica smiles .
MONICA: You ever think about going back ?
SIDRA: Sometimes . But what 's the alternative , not playing ? You remember big Toni ? She quit last year , now she 's working at some bookstore . I mean , look at us . They treat us like we 're Hollywood stars over here . We just played in the championship game . It does n't get much sweeter than this .
STU LANTZ: And here come the subs .
CHICK HEARN: Three-pointer is off for the kid from SC . Came out after his freshman year , now in his fifth year with the league .
STU LANTZ: The son of Zeke McCall , played twelve years with the Clippers .
CHICK HEARN: Pretty good player . The kid 's moved around quite a bit , but he 's hoping to finally have a home with the Lakers .
ZEKE: Nona . Nona looks over . Her eyes narrow . ZEKE How 's he doing ?
NONA: Not great .
ZEKE: What 's that , not great ?
NONA: The doctor 'll be back in a minute .
ZEKE: Nona , please .
NONA: He tore his ACL .
ZEKE: Almost did n't recognize you with you hair like that . How you been ?
NONA: Happy . And he wo n't want to see you .
ZEKE: Hey , son .
QUINCY: What do you want ?
ZEKE: Came by to check on you .
QUINCY: After five years .
ZEKE: Do n't remember that being my fault . Seems like you divorced me same time as your mom .
QUINCY: Look , I 'm busy .
ZEKE: I can see that . I know things look pretty bleak right now , but you ca n't get down on yourself .
QUINCY: I stopped taking your advice a long time ago , or did you forget ?
ZEKE: No .
QUINCY: Good .
ZEKE: Quincy . I know you left school early to throw your middle finger up at me .
QUINCY: And now I 'm paying for it , right ? That what this is about ? `` I told you so ? ''
ZEKE: You want me to fuck off ?
QUINCY: Yeah .
ZEKE: Fine , I 'll fuck off , but not til I say something . Silence . Then . ZEKE You 're a better ballplayer than I eve was . But you got a lot of other things going for you . You 're smart . I always feltI always knew that you could do anything you wanted . You want to be a allplayer , be a ballplayer . Just know you ai n't like everybody else on that court . You ai n't like I was . You got options . That 's all I ever tried to show you .
QUINCY: You 're still trying to tell me what I should and should n't do . How come you could n't be the man you kept trying to make me ?
ZEKE: I just could n't
QUINCY: Monica ?
MONICA: I 'm sorry .
QUINCY: Alright . I heard you were in Spain .
MONICA: I was . I see your peach fuzz finally grew in . Quincy rubs his goatee self-consciously .
QUINCY: Just something I 'm trying .
MONICA: No , it looks good . I mean , it 's cool .
QUINCY: Thanks .
MONICA: Should n't you be lying down , or
QUINCY: I 'm alright . But you can sit .
MONICA: I 'm fine . My dad said you tore your ACL .
QUINCY: Yup .
MONICA: What are the doctors saying ?
QUINCY: A lot of things . All I know is I 'll be ack in six months .
MONICA: I thought a torn ACL was ten to twelve .
QUINCY: Not for Quincy McCall .
MONICA: I forgot , `` Q-man . '' An awkward beat .
QUINCY: So , how 's pro-ball , Europe ?
MONICA: We won the championship .
QUINCY: Still working on being the first girl in the NBA ?
MONICA: Well , I tried sneaking in after college , ut they found breasts during my physical .
QUINCY: Funny . I never did .
MONICA: Kiss my ass . Monica cracks up . Quincy laughs with her . MONICA I ca n't believe it 's been five years . Quincy nods .
QUINCY: Tried calling you a couple times .
MONICA: Oh yeah ?
QUINCY: Wanted to give you props on making First Team All-American . And then when Magic etired , I tried calling you again .
MONICA: Must have been my cheap-ass answering machine . It was always messing up .
QUINCY: Figured it was something like that .
MONICA: Actually , I do n't
QUINCY: What do you mean ?
MONICA: I 'm tired of playing overseas . Thinking about giving it a rest for awhile .
QUINCY: A rest ?
MONICA: Yeah . Basketball just , is n't fun anymore . You know ?
QUINCY: No . He stares at her . Into her .
KYRA: I 'm so sorry . No one would switch flights with me .
QUINCY: It 's okay .
KYRA: Why are you up ? Get in bed .
QUINCY: I 'm gon na be okay .
KYRA: Hello .
QUINCY: Kyra , this is Monica . She , uh
KYRA: Monica . You grew up together , right ? Quincy 's told me about you . Monica smiles awkwardly .
QUINCY: This is Kyra . My fiance .
MONICA: Fiance . Wow . Congratulations .
KYRA: Thank you .
MONICA: I did n't know . Wow . That 's great . WellI should go .
QUINCY: It means a lot that you came by .
KYRA: Yes , we appreciate that .
MONICA: Yeah , and Quincy , good luck with you knee , and everything .
QUINCY: Thanks .
CAMILLE: Hi .
MONICA: Need any help ?
CAMILLE: I can manage . Monica nods and moves to the barstool . CAMILLE Your sister 's bringing the baby over . You should try to be here .
MONICA: Yeah . Ca n't wait to see him I just saw Quincy .
CAMILLE: How is he ?
MONICA: Engaged .
CAMILLE: To that stewardess ?
MONICA: Yeah , you met her ?
CAMILLE: His mother had a cookout a few weeks ago . He could do a lot better if you ask me .
MONICA: Maybe she is .
CAMILLE: I thought you were over him . Monica shrugs .
MONICA: So what do I do ?
CAMILLE: Find out where they 're registered and send them a gift .
MONICA: Whatever .
CAMILLE: You did n't want my opinion in the first place , so why even ask ?
MONICA: I asked but why does it always have to be so damn prissy .
CAMILLE: Do n't curse .
MONICA: There you go .
CAMILLE: What do you want me to tell you , Monica , to go beat that girl up ? To go have sex with him ? I 'm not going to do that . Yes , I believe thinking of other people is important and yes I 'd rather bake a pie than shoot a dumb jump shot . If that makes me too `` prissy '' for you , too bad .
MONICA: So that 's why we ca n't get along ? Because I 'd rather shoot a `` dumb '' jump shot ?
CAMILLE: You 're the one always turning your nose up at me .
MONICA: No I do n't .
CAMILLE: Child , please . Ever since you were little you thought you were too good fo anything I had to say .
MONICA: I was n't Lena . I did n't care about nail polish or lip gloss or sneaking a spray of your perfume .
CAMILLE: What was so wrong with wanting to teach you the things I knew could help you ?
MONICA: Because you 're pushing me to be something I 'm not .
CAMILLE: So you 're angry with me because you 're standing here with your hair combed and wearing perfume ?
MONICA: I 'm angry because I want a mother , not Martha Stewart .
CAMILLE: Oh , yes . The superstar female athlete whose mother is nothing but a housewife .
MONICA: That 's not it .
CAMILLE: Do n't tell me you are n't ashamed of that ecause I know . Monica stares at her mother .
MONICA: I remember when I was eight years old , you spent like four hours cooking up this fancy meal . All you 'd let me and Lena do was set the table . And I guess you and Dad got your wires crossed or something ecause he walks in with a couple of pizzas . And you did n't say anything . You just threw the whole meal into some tupper-ware and tossed it in the fridge .
CAMILLE: I do n't remember that .
MONICA: I do . You never stood up for yourself . Ever . If I was ashamed , it was because of that .
CAMILLE: That 's ridiculous .
MONICA: What 's ridiculous is not being a catere so your husband can feel like a man knowing his woman 's home cooking and ironing his drawers .
CAMILLE: Dammitt , Monica ! Monica is stunned , hurt .
MONICA: I 'm sorry . Camille stares at her daughter , devastated .
CAMILLE: Is that really all you think of me ? Monica ca n't answer . CAMILLE When I married your father , all I wanted was a nice house with a big kitchen so I could start my catering business . And then I got pregnant with Lena , and then I got pregnant with you . And I put it out of my mind because that 's what you did . Monica stares at her mother . CAMILLE But you want to know what day I remember ? In high school , you getting ready for the Spring Dance . I put my pearls around your neck , told you you were beautiful and you looked like you were going to cry . That day I was happy I did n't have a catering business to run off to . My family had three meals a day , had someone to pick up after them , and when my daughters went to a dance , I helped them get ready . That 's what I came to care about .
MONICA: That 's all you cared about . I must have played in a thousand games and I can only emember you being to two .
CAMILLE: You had your coaches and your father fo that stuff . It never mattered one way o the other if I went to your games .
MONICA: It mattered , Mom .
QUINCY: Damn , girl .
KYRA: What ?
QUINCY: I do n't wan na see that .
KYRA: Get used to it , babe .
QUINCY: Brother 's gon na have to start locking doors .
KYRA: Four days . Quincy nods . KYRA So are you going to be the kind of husband who wo n't let his wife work ?
QUINCY: Nah .
KYRA: Why not ?
QUINCY: You might be the only one with a job .
KYRA: Baby , do n't talk like that . Your rehab 's going well . You 'll be back before you know it .
QUINCY: Sometimes I wonder if it 's worth it . Busting my ass , for what ?
KYRA: To do what you love .
QUINCY: I do n't know sometimes .
KYRA: You 're just scared . I know rehab is hard , and you have to worry about whethe you 'll be as good as you were but you will be . I believe in you . You just have to get back on the court . Like you 'd get back on a horse .
QUINCY: A horse ?
KYRA: Do n't make fun of me when I 'm being wonderful and supportive . You belong on the court . Just like I elong in the stands , looking cute and cheering you on .
NATHAN: Hey , munchkin .
MONICA: Dad . What are you doing here ?
NATHAN: I was upstairs for a meeting . I 've been hearing good things about you .
MONICA: That tends to happen when you 're the oss 's daughter .
NATHAN: So how 's the job going ? Monica forces a smile .
MONICA: You know . Nathan looks at her , nods .
NATHAN: I think I know what the problem is .
MONICA: You shoot like a girl .
NATHAN: I 'll take that as a compliment .
MONICA: And she gets the steal . Monica goes one- on-one against Jordan , she stops , pops
QUINCY: I remember when your mom had to beat you into a dress . Monica smiles .
MONICA: You visiting ?
QUINCY: Kyra 's gone for a couple days . Figured I 'd keep Mom company .
MONICA: Who 's this guy I always see her around ?
QUINCY: Darryl . He 's alright , kinda corny .
MONICA: Sohow 's the knee ?
QUINCY: Getting there .
MONICA: Strong enough to get you down the aisle ?
QUINCY: Yeah . Two weeks . I did n't get to send you an invitation , ut if you
MONICA: That 's okay . I 'm probably , you know , usy . Quincy nods . Awkward beat .
QUINCY: Can I ask you something ? Monica looks at him . QUINCY You never told me why ball is n't fun anymore .
MONICA: It just is n't .
QUINCY: Because I 'm kinda feeling that way , too .
MONICA: You had a rough couple years , that 's all .
QUINCY: That a nice way of saying I rode the ench ?
MONICA: And you tore up your knee . Rehab is tough .
QUINCY: Nah . I have n't dribbled a ball in fou and a half months . Maybe I miss some of the attention , but besides that
MONICA: You 're serious .
QUINCY: Seems like I needed a ball when I was trying to be like my popsor trying to e better than him . Now , I kinda think I need to try something else .
MONICA: Like what ?
QUINCY: Maybe go back to school .
MONICA: Wow .
QUINCY: I mean , Kyra has n't heard the school thing yet . She 'll probably say it 's the painkillers talking .
MONICA: It 's a trip , you know ? When you 're a kid , you see the life you want , and it never crosses your mind that it 's not gon na turn out that way .
QUINCY: So why 'd you give up ball ?
MONICA: Why do you keep asking me that ?
QUINCY: Cause I do n't get it .
MONICA: Something was just missing .
QUINCY: What ?
MONICA: It does n't matter , alright . Just leave it alone .
QUINCY: Find .
CAMILLE: So you 're still breast-feeding ?
LENA: The doctor said it was okay . Anyway , I 'm still trying to lose some of this baby fat . She quickly looks over at Monica . LENA Shut up .
CAMILLE: You might want to put a jacket on him , it 's getting cold .
LENA: He 's fine .
CAMILLE: Okay .
LENA: Come on , L.P. Grandma says it 's too cold . She exits inside . Camille makes a face .
CAMILLE: God . `` Grandma . ''
MONICA: What are you talking about ?
CAMILLE: When I said Quincy could do better , I was thinking about you .
QUINCY: What 's going on ?
MONICA: We need to talk . Quincy just looks at her . MONICA Please .
QUINCY: Hold on .
MONICA: You asked me what was missing .
QUINCY: What ?
MONICA: From basketball .
QUINCY: you woke me up to tell me that ?
MONICA: It 's not fun for me anymore because you 're missing . Quincy stares at her . MONICA What I 'm trying to say is
QUINCY: I heard enough .
MONICA: What I 'm trying to say is , I 've loved you since I was eleven and the shit wo n't go away .
QUINCY: We have n't talked since college and now you wait two weeks before my wedding to say something like this ?
MONICA: I know , I probably should have said it two weeks ago .
QUINCY: You have n't changed . You still think the sun rises and sets on your ass . Well , guess what , it does n't .
MONICA: Then why are you so upset ?
QUINCY: Because you do n't pull this on someone who 's about to get married .
MONICA: Better late than never , right ?
QUINCY: Wrong . Quincy starts back toward the window .
MONICA: I 'll play you .
QUINCY: What ?
MONICA: One game . One-on-one .
QUINCY: For what ?
MONICA: Your heart .
QUINCY: You 're out of your mind .
MONICA: So you 're gon na bitch up ?
QUINCY: What 's that supposed to be , psychology ?
MONICA: I know why you broke up with me in college . And not that what you did was n't messed up , but what I did was , too . So if you forgive me , I 'll forgive you .
QUINCY: Monica , after that stuff with my dad , I could n't trust anybody , okay . I mean , I was lost . So you are forgiven . But that was five years ago . I moved on .
MONICA: Prove it . She throws him the ball .
QUINCY: What will this prove ?
MONICA: You once said the reason I beat you was ecause you wanted me to .
QUINCY: So ?
MONICA: So , if I win it 's because deep down you know you 're about to make the biggest mistake of your life , and deep down you want me to stop you .
QUINCY: And what happens when you lose ?
MONICA: If I lose , I 'll buy you a wedding present . Quincy stares at her .
QUINCY: One , five . Check .
MONICA: Nine , up . Point . She tosses Quincy the ball . MONICA Check .
QUINCY: All 's fair in love and basketball , right ?
SPORTS REPORTER: So , Magic , are you contemplating anothe comeback ?
MAGIC: No more comebacks . Tonight I 'm just enjoying being a spectator .
QUINCY: Let 's go , McCall !
