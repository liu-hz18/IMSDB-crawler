CHAD: Uh-huh .
PHIL: Does this sound weird ?
CHAD: Well I 'm not sure why you 're calling me .

PHIL: Oh that 's good .
CHAD: It was scary though .
PHIL: It 's a helluva disease .
CHAD: Sure is . So why call me ?
PHIL: I know this all seems silly . I know that maybe I sound ridiculous , like maybe this is the scene of the movie where the guy is trying to get ahold of the long-lost son , but this is that scene . Y'know ? I think they have those scenes in movies because they 're true , because they really happen . And you got ta believe me This is really happening . I mean , I can give you my phone number and you can call me back if you wan na check with whoever you can check
GWENOVIER: see , I thought you grew up here in the valley

FRANK: Oh , yeah . No , no , no . They would n't
GWEN: They would n't ?
FRANK: no , no , no . Certainly not . I was n't officialy enrolled , that 's right . Was that unclear ?
GWEN: Kind of .
FRANK: I would n't want that to be misunderstood My enrollment was totally unoffical because I was , sadly , unable to afford tuition up there . But there were three wonderful men who were kind enough to let me sit in on their classes , and they 're names are Macready , Horn and Langtree among others . I was completely independent financially , and like I said One Sad Sack A Shit . So what we 're looking at here is a true ags to riches story and I think that 's what most people respond to in `` Seduce , '' And At The End Of The Day ? Hey it may not
JIMMY GATOR: End of Round One ! Excellent work ladies
STANELY: Well that was..uh..in Frenchand that was in the opera , `` Carmen . '' And that goesum i > L'amour est un oiseau rebelle Que nul ne peut apprivoiser , Et c'est bien en vain qu'on l'appelle , S'il lui convient de refuser. < /i

RAY: You 're clear to go in .
PETE: What 's that mean ?
RAY: Have a pleasant day .
PETE: Louise what gives ? She looks up , startled .
LOUISE: Oh Pete they , uh , they gave everybody the day off while they sort things out .
PETE: Sort what out ? Are my pages done ?
LOUISE: They took 'em .
PETE: They took 'em ? Who took 'em ? Louise , what 's going on
LOUISE: Pete , I 'm not even supposed to be talking to you
PETE: Leo what 's going on ?
LEO: Peter , their hands are tied . You see that , do n't you ?
PETE: I I do n't believe this .
LEO: Are you saying it 's a mistake , that you did n't go to any meetings ? They say you did .
PETE: Who the hell is this `` they ? ''
LEO: Congress , the FBI , Red Channels , it do n't matter who the hell `` they '' is . `` They '' know who `` they '' are , that 's all that matters . Now , did you go to any meetings ?
PETE: No . Yeah I I do n't know . Maybe I did . Leo , this was before Pearl Harbor . I was in college . It was a bunch of kids , and I was just one of 'em . I did n't believe in what they were saying . Hell , I did n't even know what they were saying !
LEO: So , you 're saying that it 's true . You went to a meeting of a known communist organization .
PETE: Leo , I was trying to impress a skirt . You know me , I 'm non- political . Republican , Democrat , Communist , there 's not a dime 's worth of difference between 'em anyway .
LEO: You should watch what you say .
PETE: I do n't know who fingered me , but I 'm not a communist !
LEO: Kid , that cuts no ice with them .
PETE: What ? That I 'm accused of being a communist when I do n't happen to be one ?
LEO: They know you were at that meeting , Peter . They 've been told , and they know .
PETE: Leo , you 're my agent . Tell `` them '' to take a flyin ' piss . I did n't do anything wrong . I fought in the war , for crissakes !
LEO: Fought ? Come on , Pete , you ran the PX at Fort Dix .
PETE: I was decorated .
LEO: I know . A Purple Heart .
PETE: Exactly .
LEO: You broke your arm . You were coming out of a bar . You were drunk .
PETE: At least I was on our side ! Look , they want me to testify ? I 'll testify . I 'll tell 'em anything they want to hear ! Jesus , Leo , this is my career !
LEO: You ca n't testify .
PETE: Why not ?
LEO: Do n't take this personally , kid . If it were up to me , I 'd have you testify wearing your uniform and your medal , wrapped in a flag with one hand on your heart and the other hand on a bible . What can I say ? I like you .
PETE: Yeah , well , that 's enough .
LEO: Peter , I believe in you . More to the point , I read your new script um
PETE: `` Ashes To Ashes ? ''
LEO: That 's the one , `` Ashes To Ashes . '' I think it 's great . But it 'll never get made with this communist usiness hanging over your head . You ca n't work until you 're cleared and believe me , starting right now , I 'm gon na do everything I can to make that happen .
PETE: So , it is a blacklist .
LEO: Do n't say that . There is no such thing as a blacklist . Now , are you gon na play ball ?
PETE: Yes . Leo , goddammit this is n't fair ! Leo blows out a thin stream of smoke .
LEO: Kid , this is the United States Government we 're talkin ' about . Fair ai n't the point .
PETE: Huh . Red
SANDRA: Oh , Pete

SANDRA: He was , but he got sick . We got a new director today . Why ?
PETE: Well , whatever Frankie 's got , it 's catching .
SANDRA: You mean , he was let go , too ?
PETE: They 're saying I 'm a communist , Sandy . But I 'm not , you know that . I 'm gon na fight 'em , and I 'm gon na win , but I 'll need your help .
SANDRA: Of course , but I I do n't know how I how much help I can be to you . This is the sort of thing someone saying you 're a communist it can ruin you career .
PETE: Will you help me , Sandy ?
SANDRA: I 'll have to think about this . I have to get back I should go

PETE: I guess I did .
LARDNER: Lucky you got out , that water 's got quite a pull , and it empties straight into the ocean .
PETE: Thanks . Pete puts on the shirt .
LARDNER: Do you remember if you were driving a car ? Maybe you went over the idge . No guard rail there , it 's easy to do . It 's happened before .

HARRY: Listen to me ! The young man in there Eldridge keeps moving to the door .
ELDRIDGE: Stan Lawson found him unconscious y the wash this morning , and I 'm here to investigate , and if we find anything interesting , it 'll be in the paper , so why do n't you just
HARRY: Cecil , listen to me ! The sheriff stops .
ELDRIDGE: No wallet , huh ?
LARDNER: No identification at all . What 're you thinkin ' , Cecil ?
ELDRIDGE: What I 'm thinkin ' is we got us one a'two things here . A mystery or a damn miracle . And by god I ca n't tell which . Boy , you say you have no idea who you are ? That right ?
PETE: Yes .
ELDRIDGE: You ever been in this town before , to your knowledge ?

ELDRIDGE: The Jimmy Stewart picture ? I emember that one . Saw it over at the Bijou . So , you remember that , huh ?
PETE: `` It 's a Wonderful Life ? ''
ELDRIDGE: Or the Bijou . Either one .
PETE: I remember the picture but I do n't remember where I saw it . The Sheriff rises and crosses to the door .
ELDRIDGE: Doc , with your permission , I want to bring someone in here . Maybe it 'll jar this young man 's memory .
LARDNER: By all means . Eldridge opens the door .
ELDRIDGE: Harry , why do n't you come on in here .
LARDNER: Are you saying that he 's
ELDRIDGE: Shhhhhh .
HARRY: I knew all along . I knew you were alive ! Oh , Luke
LARDNER: Mother o'god
ELDRIDGE: Give the man a hug , boy ! That 's your father !
PETE: My father ?
ELDRIDGE: C'mon , I 'll give you two a lift ack to the Bijou .
PETE: The Bijou ?
LARDNER: That 's where you live .
PETE: We live in a theater ?
HARRY: Only one in town . Get in , son .
ELDRIDGE: Ben , when 's Delly due back ?
LARDNER: Tomorrow afternoon oh my god
ELDRIDGE: Exactly . Break it to her gently .
LARDNER: Get plenty of rest , Luke . You took a pretty big wallop there . He turns to move away , then turns back .
LUKE: Excuse me what 's your , um , you name ?
HARRY: Harry , son . Harry .
LUKE: And what 's my name again ?
HARRY: Albert Lucas Trumbo . But you 've een `` Luke '' since you were a baby .
LUKE: Ah . Luke . Luke . I like it .
LUKE: How long have I been gone ? Eldridge looks at Harry , who stares ahead .
HARRY: You never came back from the war . We were told you were missing and presumed dead .
LUKE: When did I leave ?
HARRY: You joined up one month to the day after Pearl Harbor . January seventh nineteen forty-two .
LUKE: Nine and-a-half years
ELDRIDGE: Comin ' up on the Bijou , gents .
HARRY: Well , son , you 're home !
HARRY: Thanks for the lift , Cecil .
ELDRIDGE: Do n't mention it . Welcome home , Luke .
LUKE: Thanks .
HARRY: Wait 'll you see the inside !
LUKE: Ca n't wait .
HARRY: We 've been closed for a while .
LUKE: Ah .
LUKE: Exactly how long has the Bijou been closed ?
HARRY: Hmmmm after you left , it was difficult , and then Lily that 's your mother she took ill and died we have n't shown a picture since forty-eight .
LUKE: Why ?
HARRY: Well , after the war , with so many of the town 's boys killed , people around here did n't much feel like going to the movies , I guess . Some of 'em moved away Los Angeles , Sacramento , San Francisco . Was n't much to keep 'em here , I expect . And now with this `` television '' thing people just are n't going out as much as they used to .
LUKE: Did n't you have any help ?
HARRY: Oh , I had Irene and Old Tim but they really could n't help much . Broke their hearts when we closed up . Broke mine , too . But now that you 're back , well , things will be different around here , that 's for sure . C'mon , I 'll show you where we live .
LUKE: Mother . She 's beautiful .
HARRY: Well , yes , that she was . She certainly made this place a home .
HARRY: 'Morning , Son .
ELDERLY WOMAN: Good morning , Luke .
HARRY: Sleep well ? Luke is speechless . It he dreaming this ?
LUKE: Who are they ?
HARRY: This is the staff of the Bijou .
LUKE: Oh . What what time is it ?
HARRY: Six-thirty . I thought we 'd get an early start .
MRS. TERWILLIGER: Head cashier and refreshments clerk . So glad to have you back , my boy ! Much more handsome than I remembe him .
HARRY: And this fine fellow is our head usher , resident fix-it man and custodian . Luke , meet Old Tim . You remember Luke , do n't you ?
LUKE: Is there a young Tim ?
OLD TIM: No .
LUKE: Well , then , why do they call you `` Old Tim ? '' Pause .
OLD TIM: I 'm old . Harry steps forward , takes Luke 's arm .
HARRY: Well , lots to do , so we 'd bette get a move on
OLD TIM: I n-need me a new uniform . Luke looks at Old Tim , then at Harry .
HARRY: I promised him a new uniform when we re-opened . And you 'll get one , too .
LUKE: You know , I hate to bring this up , ut screens and uniforms and paint and repairs are going to take money , which I 'm willing to bet none of us has . Silence from the group .
HARRY: Anyone want to see the projector ?
OLD TIM: Bless .
MRS. TERWILLIGER: Thank you , Timothy .
OLD TIM: Dunno . Boy 's smart .
MRS. TERWILLIGER: Yes , he seems to be .
OLD TIM: Bad for us .
LUKE: Um Harry ? Did I ever keep the ooks here ?
HARRY: No , your mother did , then I did after she passed .
LUKE: Well , I 'm the first one to admit that I do n't know anything about ookkeeping , but there are some very interesting things in here . He scans down a page .
HARRY: Gary Cooper . And Barbara Stanwyck . Yowsa .
LUKE: `` Eight p.m. showtime , ninety-six admissions , receipts including concessions , $ 84.75 plus one fryer and two-dozen eggs . ''
HARRY: Yes ?
LUKE: `` one fryer and two-dozen eggs ? ''
HARRY: Forty-two was a lean year around here . The war had just started you were gone less than a month and we were coming off a bit of a drought as I recall . Not everyone could ante up the price of a ticket , and a chicken 's as good as money if you ask me . At that time , it meant a lot to the folks around here to be able to come to the pictures .
LUKE: Yeah , I know , but poultry ?
HARRY: I know it 's hard to believe , son , ut this place , this little place this was n't a theater then , this was a palace ! Any man , woman , child , you , me , it did n't matter , you bought your ticket and you walked in and you Harry puts his hand on his chest and sighs .
LUKE: But I
HARRY: Son , I think you loved the Bijou even more than I did . You 've got to remember that . You 've got to .
ADELE: Dad ?
LARDNER: Delly ? In here .
ADELE: Not as bad as I thought it would . I think I passed .
LARDNER: That 's my girl ! Did you ?
ADELE: No hiccups , which was good . Who wants an attorney who gets the hiccups when she gets nervous ? `` Your honor , I object ! '' They laugh .
LARDNER: I always told you , baby it 's all up here .
ADELE: Dad ? What is it ? Beat .
LARDNER: Well , it 's Adele breaks away from him .
ADELE: Oh my god who died ?
LARDNER: Drink slowly . She raises the glass to her lips .
ADELE: I think it 's worse now .
LARDNER: That always used to work .
ADELE: Yeah , well it 's not everyday you get news like this . You 're sure he 's okay ? Other than the bump on the head ?
LARDNER: Well
ADELE: Dad
LARDNER: He does n't remember anything , Delly . Does n't know how he got here , does n't remember his father , the town , the Bijou , anyone
ADELE: including me . Right ?
LARDNER: I 'm afraid not . He looked right at your picture without batting an eye . But it 's probably temporary . He got all the way to Lawson , so he clearly knew who he was and what he was doing until he hit his head . I 'm sure it 'll all come back to him . It just takes a catalyst .
ADELE: You mean , me ?
LARDNER: It 's possible . Off Adele 's thoughtful hiccuping , we
HARRY: I take breakfast and supper at Mabel 's every day except Sunday . Have for years , since Lily died . If it were n't for Mabel , I 'd probably starve to death .
ERNIE: Harry ! Hold on a second !
HARRY: It 's really him , Ernie .
ERNIE: Well , I 'll be
LUKE: Uh , thanks . Good to see you again , too , uh
HARRY: Ernie .
LUKE: Ernie .
ERNIE: Well , I 'll be
HARRY: We were just gon na get some supper . Would you like to join us ?
ERNIE: Would I ever !
WOMAN'S VOICE: Is that Luke Trumbo ?
KATIE: Oh , Luke , it 's so good to have you ack !
HARRY: Katie , would you like to join us for dinner ? The more , the merrier .
CARL: Hey , Luke , remember the time you and me , we was playing with firecrackers and the one you was lighting blew up too soon and singed all the hair offa my head ?
LUKE: Uh , no . What happened ?
CARL: Well um , all the hair got singed offa my head . It was pretty funny . A couple of TITTERS are heard .
LUKE: Oh .
CARL: Even my eyebrows . But they grew ack .
HARRY: Carl . Friend of yours from high school . Everybody calls him `` Cueball . ''
LUKE: Oh , hi Cue Carl . Sorry .
CARL: Oh , heck , that 's all right . It 's just good to have you back . Is n't that right , Bob ? Hey , Luke , you emember my brother Bob ? You two joined up the same day .
LUKE: Hey , Bob . Good to meet you .
ERNIE: Luke , I know there 's a question that 's on everybody 's mind .
LUKE: What 's that ?
ERNIE: Well , now that you 're back , what 're your plans ?
HARRY: Gon na re-open the Bijou , that 's what .
STANTON: That true ?
LUKE: Well we 're gon na try .
ERNIE: That 's a lot of work , son . Place 's een closed , what , three , fou years now . Gon na be tough .
HARRY: If it 's tough , that means it 's worth doing .
ERNIE: Hey , where 's Spencer Wyatt ?
SPENCER'S VOICE: Uh , back here , Mr. Mayor .
ERNIE: Well , come on out here so 's we can see you .
SPENCER: Hey , Luke .
LUKE: Hi , Spencer .
ERNIE: Spence , that band of yours you think they 're ready to play ? Spencer and his pals went ahead and got together a good ol ' big band .
SPENCER: We 've been practicing uh , sure , I guess .
ERNIE: Well , how about tomorrow night , eight p.m. , in city hall square ? What I 'm proposin ' is a `` Welcome Home Luke '' celebration .
LUKE: I 've seen you before . You picture
MABEL: Look !
LUKE: but I do n't think I remembe you .
ADELE: No , I I just wondering where you 've been all this time .
LUKE: Me too .
ADELE: You look different .
LUKE: I do ?
ADELE: Yeah , a little . I think you grew an inch or so . And you 've lost weight .
LUKE: I did ? Huh !
ADELE: You can all go home , now . He 's not going anywhere .
LUKE: Go on home , folks . And thanks fo the welcome . Harry comes over .
HARRY: You two have a lot of catching up to do , I guess .
LUKE: You bet .
HARRY: Goodnight , son . 'Night , Delly .
LUKE: There . We 're alone . They turn and start walking .
ADELE: Then why do I feel like we 're still eing shadowed ?
LUKE: Well where can we go ? Adele brightens .
ADELE: I know a place . Come on !
LUKE: City hall ?
ADELE: You must not remember anything . Come on .
LUKE: Why me ?
ADELE: Be a gentleman . You have to help me down .
LUKE: How 'd they get it inside ?
ADELE: Through the door . It comes apart .
LUKE: It does n't seem right , this being down here . It ought to be where people can see it .
ADELE: After they commissioned it , no one could ever agree on where to put it . The Methodists wanted it in front of the Methodist Church , the Presbyterians wanted it in front of the Presbyterian Church , the city council wanted it in the lobby of City Hall . Everyone finally got tired of the fighting . So they stuck it down here .
LUKE: So , you 're really gon na be a lawyer ?
ADELE: And why not ?
LUKE: Whoa .
ADELE: Sorry . You do n't know how many times I 've heard that . `` A lady lawyer ? Are you crazy ? '' Like a woman could n't be as good a lawye as a man . Or better , in fact .
LUKE: Have you always wanted to be a lawyer ?
ADELE: You do n't remember , but yes , ever since I was a little girl .
LUKE: What did what did I want to be ?
ADELE: Oh , well I guess you in high school , you were a pretty good first baseman . And we were on the debate team together . But I think you were gon na run the Bijou . You were brought up there , and you loved it so much . And I think you knew how much the town needed a place like that . He turns away , rubs his head .
LUKE: I just wish I could remember some of this . He turns back to her .
ADELE: Actually , I was married . For fou years . But well , we did n't fit together . I 'm divorced now .
LUKE: I 'm sorry .
ADELE: No , it 's okay . See , when two people belong together , the othe person should be the the key that unlocks the rest of you I 'm not making sense , am I ?
LUKE: No , you are . I know exactly what you mean . It 's not that you 're missing something . It 's that the other person gives something to you that you had all the time . You just did n't see it until they came along .
ADELE: Yeah Pause .
LUKE: We were in love were n't we ?
ADELE: Yes . Hic !
LUKE: What was that ?
ADELE: Nothing .
LUKE: Do you have the
ADELE: I 'm fine . Really .
LUKE: Were we going to get married ?
ADELE: Eventually . We were going to be engaged when you came ack from overseas
LUKE: Hey , fella . So you live here , too , huh ? How come Harry did n't mention that ?
OLD TIM: Found me .
LUKE: Yeah . I hope you do n't mind . I did n't know anyone lived here well , besides Harry . And me .
OLD TIM: Not used to visitors . Sit .
LUKE: So I guess this fellow belongs to you . What 's his name ?
OLD TIM: Cat .
LUKE: Cat . That 's simple . I like it . Hi , Cat .
OLD TIM: We thought you was dead , you know . It 's okay that I live here ?
LUKE: Of course . Pause , then suddenly .
OLD TIM: Do you think I 'll get me a new u-u uniform ?
LUKE: I 'll do everything I can .
OLD TIM: T-t-thank you . Thank you . I I always I always wanted to wea my uniform from the Great War , but your daddy , he always said no , that 's not an usher 's u-u-uniform , that 's an army uniform and the Bijou , she 's not the army . They give me a medal , but I lost it in the h-h-hospital . I forget things sometimes . Since the w-w-war .
LUKE: Yeah me too .
LEO: You smell gas ?
SUPER: Do n't smell nothin ' . He must not e dead in here .
LEO: Jesus .
SUPER: Hey , it 's the best way to tell .
LEO: Would n't blame him if he was .
SUPER: Well , his rent 's past due and he said to call you in case of an emergency . He lose his job o somethin ' ?
LEO: What 's his rent ?
SUPER: Thirty a month . Leo peels off a hundred-dollar bill .
LEO: Here 's three months rent , and a ten spot for no more questions and to keep an eye on his place . Now , I need a moment alone .
SUPER: Huh ?
LEO: Take a hike . Am-scray .
SUPER: Huh ? Oh , sure . Just pull the doo shut when you leave .
LEO: Police department . I want to eport a missing person .
CLYDE: You say you know nothing about it . You say this , yet you offer no proof . How am I supposed to elieve you ?
SECRETARY: Mr. Clyde ? Agents Saunders and Brett need to see you .
CLYDE: You do see that I 'm busy , do you not ?
SECRETARY: It 's about Appleton . Clyde 's eyes brighten .
CLYDE: Tell them to come in . I 'll have to call you back . I love you too , Mother . Saunders and Brett stride into the office .
SAUNDERS: We 've got a situation developing
CLYDE: Will you take those goddamn hats off ?
SAUNDERS: We 've got a situation developing out on the coast . Appleton 's just een reported missing . Clyde grins darkly .
CLYDE: This is good . This is very good .
BRETT: Los Angeles Police Department investigated . His car 's missing . No signs of forced entry o struggle at his apartment . Clyde considers this for a beat , then
CLYDE: You two are on this as of now . Tell the LAPD their investigation has been federalized on my order . You find me this Appleton . I want to see what this one has to say .
LUKE: Well
HARRY: Yes ?
LUKE: Between a new screen , paint , plumbing for the concession stand , and about a hundred other repairs around the theater it 's going to cost at least nine hundred dollars to get the Bijou into shape to open up .
MRS. TERWILLIGER: Oh , my .
HARRY: Nine hundred
LUKE: And you have sixty-eight dollars and thirty-seven cents in the bank . Your only source of income are my veteran 's death benefit of forty dollars a month , to which you 're no longer entitled since I 'm alive , and these ten dollar a month cash deposits you make . What are those ?
HARRY: They 're
OLD TIM: That 's my r-r-rent .
LUKE: Oh .
HARRY: It 's all my fault . I was neglectful and this is the price of that .
MRS. TERWILLIGER: Do n't say that .
HARRY: Well , it 's true . Wanting to open this place back up . It 's folly , Irene , pure and simple . Might as well just call it what it is . Off everyone 's worried looks , we
LARDNER: Honey , I I ca n't it 's the There 's a KNOCK at the door .
LUKE: Evening , Doctor Lardner . Lardner freezes , staring at Luke .
LARDNER: Uh , no just seeing you standing there , it reminded me there 's a word for it
LUKE: Oh , you mean the suit . Harry kept all my old clothes . Fits okay , but it 's a little big .
ADELE: Oh
LUKE: I should n't have worn the suit . Adele comes down the stairs .
ADELE: No you were wearing that suit the last time we went out before
LUKE: Oh
ADELE: and It 's just well , deja vu .
LARDNER: That 's it . Deja vu .
LUKE: Are n't you coming ?
LARDNER: No , I 'm not much of a dancer .
ADELE: Besides , Daddy 's still trying to figure out how to get his new television set working .
LARDNER: I had it , a minute ago
ADELE: This is strange . Do you feel it ?
LUKE: What ?
ADELE: We 've done this before , so many times . The last time was so long ago , but it feels like yesterday .
LUKE: Oh . Pause .
ADELE: You know , everyone 's so excited about the Bijou re-opening
LUKE: It 's gon na cost over nine hundred dollars to open the place , Delly .
ADELE: Nine hundred
LUKE: Yeah , and needless to say , none of us has that kind of money lying around .
ADELE: What about a loan ? You could go to the bank ?
LUKE: A loan to a man who ran his usiness into the ground and his son who ca n't account for the last nine-and-a-half years of his life ? Not likely .
ADELE: Well , there 's got to be a way
LUKE: Have you got a cigarette ? Adele stops .
ADELE: When did you start smoking ?
LUKE: I do n't smoke ?
ADELE: You tried to once . It was pretty pitiful .
LUKE: Oh . Adele glances curiously at Luke as we
LUKE: They 're not bad .
ADELE: No , they 're not . I 'd say you investment was paying dividends .
LUKE: My what ?
ADELE: Back in '37 , you heard Benny Goodman play for the first time , so you went out and got a used clarinet . You wanted nothing more than to be able to play like him . You tried hard , but it was n't long efore it was clear that Benny Goodman would never be looking ove his shoulder . So you gave the clarinet to Spencer .
LUKE: Huh . That was nice of me .
ADELE: You had a hidden agenda , though . See , when he was five or six , little Spence used to follow you around like a puppy . Bothered the hell out of you . But as soon as you gave him the clarinet
LUKE: he started practicing , and he left me alone from then on .
ADELE: Exactly . And he got good .
LUKE: No kidding . They dance a bit .
ADELE: Now , did you remember that , or
LUKE: Nope . Just filling in the blanks .
ADELE: Oh . Okay . And as they dance away , we
ALEX: You 're the luckiest guy in town , Luke . Delly 's 'bout the prettiest thing ever come outta Lawson .
LUKE: Thanks , Charlie .
ALEX: I 'm Alex . He 's Charlie .
CHARLIE: I 'm Charlie .
ALEX: Yessir , 'bout the prettiest thing we ever seen , ai n't that right , Charlie ?
CHARLIE: You bet .
ADELE: Thanks boys , ya flatter me no end . The brothers laugh goofily .
CHARLIE: Hey , she 's doin ' that movie star , what 's her name ?
ALEX: Hey , Delly , what was that test you was outta town takin ' ?
ADELE: It 's called the State Bar Exam .
CHARLIE: Shoot !
ALEX: Imagine that , Charlie ! A lady artender !
LUKE: How do you tell those two apart , anyway ?
ADELE: Alex and Charlie ? Simple . Alex is the smarter one .
LUKE: That 's pretty frightening . They laugh and dance a bit more .
ADELE: Your dancing 's very good .
LUKE: Thanks .
ADELE: It never used to be . You were two left feet on the dance floor . Like pulling teeth to get you to do a little box step .
LUKE: Guess I must 've learned .
SPENCER: Thanks , folks . Gee , can you tell we never played in front of people efore ?
ERNIE: Pretty proud of your boy , Avery ?
LUKE: Why do n't you two get out there and dance ?
HARRY: Oh , no , I Mrs. Terwilliger blushes .
MRS. TERWILLIGER: I have n't danced with another man since Mr. Terwilliger passed .
LUKE: When was that ?
MRS. TERWILLIGER: Nineteen-oh-nine . Harry touches Luke 's arm .
HARRY: Son , we 're gon na go . You two kids have a lovely time .
ALEX: Delly , can I have a dance ?
ADELE: Sure .
FITTS: Luke , you probably do n't remembe me , Roscoe Fitts , I 'm the groce here in town .
LUKE: Good to meet you . Again .
FITTS: Like Ernie said , we 're all glad to have you back .
LUKE: Thanks .
FITTS: And I hear you and Harry are planning on re-opening the Bijou .
LUKE: We 're gon na try . Place needs a lot of work .
FITTS: I can only imagine . You know , I spoke with your Dad last year about maybe taking the Bijou off his hands . I do n't think he gave it very much thought .
LUKE: Well , he loves the place . It 's his home .
FITTS: Luke , I 'm hopping you can help him see the reality of the situation . I 'll come to the point . I want to uy the property , and I 'm prepared to offer six-thousand dollars fo it . And that 's just for the property , mind you . If you want , I 'll leave it to you and you father to dismantle and liquidate the building for whatever salvage value it has , and you keep those proceeds . I just want the land .
LUKE: That 's well , that 's very generous , but if you 've already got a store ?
FITTS: The days of the storefront grocery are numbered . I plan on putting up a free-standing supermarket .
LUKE: A super market . Huh .
FITTS: You think it over . No reason to isk financial ruin for the sake of a crumbling old building . Fitts takes Luke 's hand and shakes it .
SPENCER: Last dance , folks !
HARRY: Beautiful , was n't it ?
LUKE: Yes .
HARRY: Well , son , I wish I could 've shown you more , but this is all that 's left . Just this one reel that never got sent back from a picture we showed here a long time ago . Nineteen twenty-five , to be exact
LUKE: Dad , I
HARRY: Ha !
LUKE: what ?
HARRY: You know , since you 've been back , that 's the first time you 've called me `` Dad . ''
LUKE'S VOICE: Harry . Dad , wake up . Wake up . Harry opens his eyes and looks up .
HARRY: Luke what time is it ?
LUKE: Six-thirty . I thought we 'd get an early start .
VERA: Finally , Roscoe Fitts moved , and Red Curtis seconded , that the council form a committee to investigate the adoption of a new property taxation structure . Motion carried , nine to two , one abstention .
ERNIE: Thanks , Vera . Ernie notices Luke and the trio .
LUKE: Well , no I wanted to thank you all fo giving me such a nice welcome , and making me feel at home . But I we 're actually here on business of a sort
DALEY: Point of order , Mr. Mayor , this comes under the heading `` New Business , '' and this is not the time
ERNIE: I think we can make an exception here , Daley .
DALEY: It 'll need to be moved and seconded .
ERNIE: All right , motion to hear the speaker out of order .
WYATT: Seconded .
ERNIE: Motion on the floor , discussion open , discussion closed , all those in favor signify by saying `` aye . ''
ALL: Aye .
ERNIE: Opposed ? Hearing no opposition , the motion is carried . Pause . Ernie turns to Luke and smiles .
LUKE: Thanks . Well , I 'll make this short and sweet . The Bijou needs a lot of repairs , and the truth of the matter is , Harry , um , that is , Dad and me , Mrs. Terwilliger and Old Tim , we ca n't possible afford them all . So , I 'd like to ask your help to well , to scrounge around a it , and see if you have anything that might help us out .
WYATT: What kinds of things are you talking about ?
LUKE: Oh , paint , brushes , plaster , light ulbs , yardage , and if you ca n't come up with any of that , we can use some old-fashioned elbow grease . Fitts leans forward .
FITTS: So you do intend to fix the place up after all ?
LUKE: Mr. Fitts , with all due respect , I think Lawson needs the Bijou a bit more than it needs a super market . And I think Lawson deserves the Bijou . There 's not a lot that can e done to help us get past the pain we 've all felt He looks at Harry and smiles .
WYATT: Motion to encourage the citizenry of Lawson to help out the Bijou in any way they can
DALEY: short of the allocation of city funds
WYATT: short of allocation of city funds .
DALEY: Seconded !
ERNIE: Motion on the floor , discussion open , discussion closed , all those in favor signify by saying `` aye . ''
ALL: AYE !
ERNIE: Hearing no opposition , the motion is carried ! Congratulations , Luke , you got yourself a town to help you out !
LUKE: That was beautiful .
MRS. TERWILLIGER: I taught you that .
LUKE: I can play the piano ?
MRS. TERWILLIGER: Oh dear , yes . You were an excellent student , before all that clarinet nonsense . You loved Chopin . You used to call it `` heaven music . '' `` Teach me some heaven music , '' you used to say . She sits at the piano .
LUKE: No , I
MRS. TERWILLIGER: Some of it might come back to you .
GENE KELLY: AN AMERICAN IN PARIS
LUKE: `` Ha ! I 'd say I was winning ! ''
LUKE: Sandra ?
MRS. TERWILLIGER: Luke ? Dear , are you all right ?
LUKE: My god my god no
HARRY: Oh , baby , make your daddy happy
OLD TIM: Mr. Luke ! Luke stares wide-eyed at the old man .
MRS. TERWILLIGER: Luke ! Luke , something 's wrong ! The film broke , and I ca n't raise Harry on the house phone !
LUKE: What ?
MRS. TERWILLIGER: You 've got to talk to them before they tear the theater apart !
LUKE: Come on , folks , this happens every once in a while , just settle down
HARRY: The film broke
LUKE: I know , I know keep still .
LARDNER: It 's a pretty massive heart attack . His lungs have filled with fluid , and , well it seems as though his ody is just shutting down .
LUKE: Can we get him to the hospital ?
LARDNER: Even if we could , and the move did n't kill him , there 'd be very little we could do there that we ca n't do here . I 'm sorry . Harry 's eyelids flutter .
HARRY: Did you did you
LUKE: I 'm here .
HARRY: Did you did you
LUKE: Did I what ?
HARRY: Did you fix the damn film ? It oke in the last reel .
LUKE: I know . Everyone went home . We offered them refunds .
HARRY: Anybody take it ?
LUKE: A few .
HARRY: Vultures Luke smiles .
LUKE: You 're not going anywhere , Harry .
HARRY: Do n't tell me , I know about these things . I 've seen it before . It 's all right . It 's all right . You 're here . Oh , God , I love you , son .
LUKE: And I love you Dad .
HARRY: Oh , so much lighter
COLEMAN: We commit to the earth the mortal emains of Harry Bernard Trumbo , safe in the knowledge that his immortal soul is at peace and at last reunited with his beloved Lillian in the bosom of the Lord . Let us pray . Everyone bows their heads .
LUKE: Sure .
ADELE: What do you remember ?
LUKE: Well everything . It started coming back a couple of days ago . I remember everything now .
ADELE: I see
LUKE: Delly . I 'm I 'm not Harry was n't my father . And I 'm not I 'm not Luke .
ADELE: Oh
LUKE: I fell in love with you , too , Delly . Only now I do n't know how I feel , about you or about anything . I only think I know how Luke would feel .
ADELE: No I ca n't I have to I ca n't She runs off , crying
SAUNDERS: Are you the sheriff ?
ELDRIDGE: And I got the uniform to prove it .
SAUNDERS: I 'm Special Agent Walter Saunders , this is Special Agent Steven Brett , FBI . May we have a word with you ?
ELDRIDGE: Please , sit .
SAUNDERS: A couple of days ago , a county flood control maintenance crew pulled a car out of the Lawson Wash ocean outlet . They checked its egistration , and when the owne was identified , they notified us . Agent Brett slides the photo toward Eldridge .
ELDRIDGE: Well , that 'd be Luke Trumbo . Looks like you boys 've solved a little mystery we 've had going on for a few months .
BRETT: Sir , that 's a photo of man named Peter Appleton . He 's been missing from Los Angeles for close to three months now .
ELDRIDGE: What ? No , there 's got to be a
SAUNDERS: Sheriff this man is a suspected communist .
PETE: Am I under arrest ?
ELDRIDGE: Well , no , but these gentlemen would like to get some answers
PETE: I do n't know what else to tell you . I was n't hiding out . I hit my head and I did n't remember anything until a few days ago .
SAUNDERS: Now that you remember who you are , were you planning on telling anyone your true identity ?
PETE: I already have .
SAUNDERS: Who ?
PETE: My girlfriend . If she still is
SAUNDERS: Would that be Miss Sinclair ?
PETE: No . No , not Miss Sinclair . I 'm talking about Adele Lardner . Agent Saunders glances at Eldridge .
ELDRIDGE: The doctor 's daughter . She was Luke Trumbo 's sweetheart . Pause .
SAUNDERS: Mr. Appleton , I have reason to elieve you 're holding something ack , and that just rubs me the wrong way . Sir , are you a communist ?
PETE: No . Absolutely not .
SAUNDERS: All right . All right . We 'll see .
PETE: Let 's close up .
ADELE'S VOICE: It 's me .
ADELE: Hi .
PETE: Hi . Pause .
ADELE: I 'm sure a lot of people down in L.A. are worried sick about you .
PETE: Yeah ? I 'm sure a lot more people down in L.A. want a piece of me . He turns to her .
ADELE: Oh , yes . Yes , he was .
PETE: Well let me tell you , I 'm not Luke . I know who I am now , and you do n't . And I do n't like me very much .
ADELE: You know , it 's going to take me a while to get used to calling you Pete . Pete . Pete . It 's a nice name .
PETE: Thanks , I like it . I think . Pause .
ADELE: I believe you .
PETE: The truth is , I 'm a lot of things , ut communist is n't one of them .
ADELE: But if you only went to one meeting , why does anyone care ? Besides , why should it even matte if you were a communist ?
PETE: Come on , Delly , look at the country today . We 're fighting communists in Korea , we 're paranoid about the Russians , we 've got this thing with the Rosenbergs and the atomic omb You think they want `` suspected communists '' entertaining the American public with party propaganda like , gosh I do n't know , `` Sand Pirates of the Sahara ? ''
ADELE: Forget about all that . You want to do the right thing ? Then defend your name . If someone says something about you that 's untrue , you have to stand up and say so . I know the law , and the law 's on your side . Beat .
PETE: What about you , Delly ?
ADELE: I am , too . Pete smiles and puts his arms around her .
PETE: You 'll stand by me ?
ADELE: Whatever happens . They kiss , and we
RORY: Whatsit , girl ?
REPORTER: I 'm here with Mabel Lanier , the owner of the diner here on Commerce Street where Appleton often took meals . Mrs. Lanier , tell me , what are your thoughts about having such a celebrated suspected communist in your midst all this time ?
MABEL: Well , its kinds hard to believe , 'cause Luke I mean Peter is such a I mean , since he 's been ack , I 've never seen the town so happy and all . It 's like he gave us some I do n't know some hope , I guess .
REPORTER: What she 's referring to folks , is yet another bizarre twist in this story . Not only is Appleton alive , ut he 's been suffering from amnesia and living here in Lawson , where , due to a startling esemblance , everyone in town fo the last three months has taken him for one of Lawson 's dead wa heroes , Albert Trumbo
MABEL: Luke . We always called him Luke . Mabel glances at Bob , who lowers his head .
LEO: The FBI ca n't arrest you , because you have n't done anything wrong .
PETE: Well , that 's a relief . I understand they usually do n't let that stop them .
LEO: However you 're gon na be subpoenaed to testify before the Un-American Activities Committee when they open hearings in Los Angeles . Now , if you play ball and tell them what they want to hear , they 'll clear you .
PETE: And I wo n't be a communist anymore .
LEO: Exactly .
PETE: So it does n't make any difference that I 'm not one now , and have never been one . Leo stands and walks to the window .
LEO: Kid , do n't get philosophical with me . This is a game , but it 's not your game . You play by thei ules , or they 'll ruin you . And they have the power to do it .
ADELE: Does n't it bother anyone that this is a perversion of democracy ?
LEO: Darling , do n't kid yourself . We do n't have a `` democracy '' in this country . The Declaration of Independence ? The Constitution ? These are pieces of paper with signatures on 'em . And you know what a piece of paper with a signature is ? It 's a contract . And you know what a contract is ? Something that can be re-negotiated at any time . It just so happens that the House Un-American Activities Committee is re- negotiating the contract this time around . Leo takes out a cigarette , lights it .
PETE: That 's not the country Luke fought for .
LEO: Lest we forget , Peter , your own military career was somewhat less illustrious than Luke 's .
PETE: It 's wrong , Leo .
LEO: Peter , do n't let that stop you all of a sudden .
THE MAN: Peter Appleton ?
PETE: You found him .
THE MAN: Peter Appleton , you are hereby subpoenaed to appear as a witness efore a special session of the House Committee on Un-American Activities . You are to appear in Los Angeles , California , at the Biltmore Hotel , at the date and time specified herein .
PETE: This is a great honor . I 'll treasure this always . Thank you .
PETE: `` I , Peter Appleton , do hereby enounce my membership in the American Communist Party , and by way of purging myself of my indiscretion , wish to provide the following names of fellow members to this committee , so that those persons may have the opportunity to do as I have done '' He scans down the page . It 's a long list .
PETE: Old Tim ?
OLD TIM: Can I Can I t-t-talk to you ?
PETE: Sure . Come on in . I was just packing .
OLD TIM: Thanks . He sits . Pause .
PETE: The customers ? I do n't know
OLD TIM: They will . They w-w-will . Pete turns to Old Tim , fixes him in the eye .
PETE: Tim , I have to tell you something .
OLD TIM: Oh .
PETE: It 's about me .
OLD TIM: Oh .
PETE: I 'm I 'm not Luke . Luke is dead . He died in the war . He 's not coming back , and I 'm not him . I do n't even belong here . This whole thing started out as an accident , and that 's all it is . An accident .
OLD TIM: Oh
PETE: My name is n't Luke . It 's Peter . Peter Appleton . Old Tim stands and looks askance at Pete . Pause .
OLD TIM: Did you think I did n't kn-kn-know that ?
PETE: I thought you
OLD TIM: I know more than you give me c-c- credit , that 's for sure . Do n't you see , it do n't m-m-matter who you are ? All that matters is what you g-g-gave us . And you ca n't take that away now . You 're wrong , Pete Appleton . You do belong here . He leans down to Pete .
ADELE: You 've got everything ?
PETE: Yeah . Except a chance in hell of coming out of this intact .
ADELE: You 'll be fine . No matter what Leo Kubelsky says , you 've got a hundred and seventy-five years of American law on your side . Do n't forget that .
PETE: I wish you were coming with me .
ADELE: And who 's gon na run the projecto until you get back ? Mrs. Terwilliger ?
PETE: Maybe we could train Cat to run the projector . You know , a system of scratching posts , and gears , and levers They both smile as the train 's HORN blows .
CONDUCTOR: Board !
ADELE: Did you bring along something to ead ?
PETE: Damn
ADELE: I did n't think so . Here . This is mine , you can borrow it .
ADELE: Not exactly light reading , I know . Believe it or not , I 've read this since high school , and it got me all the way through law school . Besides , there 's something in there that 'll help you . You wo n't have to get very far , it 's near the eginning .
PETE: Delly thanks , thank you . I 'll take good care of this .
ADELE: Just remember two things . First , the law is a living thing . It made us free and it keeps us free . Sometimes it gets twisted around by people for their own purposes . Sometimes it makes mistakes , sometimes big mistakes . But in the end , the law prevails for the just . Sometimes , it takes a while .
PETE: Okay . What 's the second thing ?
ADELE: I 'll be here if you come back .
LARDNER: This television 's a grand little invention , is n't it ?
DOYLE: The agenda for this morning 's special session of the House Committee on Un-American Activities shows a number of witnesses , and I 'd like to admonish those that are here to view the testimony of ou first witness to keep order at all times , or this chamber will be closed . I 'm referring especially to the ladies and gentlemen of the press . I hope that 's clear .
DOYLE: The witness will please stand and aise his right hand . Pete does as instructed .
PETE: I do .
DOYLE: Be seated and state your full name and place of residence for the ecord .
PETE: Peter Kenneth Appleton . Hollywood , California .
DOYLE: The chair notes that you are appearing without the benefit of counsel today , Mr. Appleton . We certainly hope this means that you intend to be fully forthcoming with this committee ?
PETE: I 'll do my best , Mr. Chairman .
DOYLE: Now , we 're informed that you have a statement you 'd like to read , is that correct ?
PETE: A statement ? Doyle and Clyde exchange glances .
DOYLE: Yes . A prepared statement .
PETE: Um no . I do n't have a statement at this time .
MRS. TERWILLIGER: I think he 's doing very well , so far .
ADELE: They have n't called out the dogs yet .
CLYDE: Mr. Appleton , you mention that you home is Hollywood , California . But is n't it true that for the last several months , you 've made you home in a town called Lawson , California ?
PETE: Sir , that is true .
CLYDE: Mr. Appleton , do you know an `` Albert Lucas Trumbo ? ''
PETE: Luke Trumbo ? We never met . But I 'd like to think I know him .
CLYDE: Is that because you were masquerading as Luke Trumbo while you were in Lawson ?
PETE: Mr. Clyde you 're twisting things around . I was n't masquerading . Luke Trumbo Luke was a good man who gave his life for his country . I just happen to look a little it like him . That 's all .
CLYDE: Yes , I see that Private Trumbo was eported missing in action and is presumed dead . I also see that you were posted stateside during the war . Fort Dix ?
PETE: Yes , sir .
CLYDE: Well , I 'm sure we 're all glad to see you came through it all right . A few spectators titter .
PETE: Yes .
CLYDE: And what is the state of you memory now ? Beat . Pete smiles .
PETE: I 'm sorry , what was the question ?
CLYDE: We appreciate your little note of levity , Mr. Appleton , but this is a very serious matter , and it merits your fullest attention . That state of your memory now , Mr. Appleton ?
PETE: Mr. Clyde , I remember everything .
CLYDE: Good . Good . Now , I hold in my hand a photostatic copy of the attendance oster for the `` Bread Instead of Bullets Club '' of the University of California , Los Angeles , dated October 11 , 1935 . A copy of this paper is before you , Mr. Appleton . Do you recognize it ?
PETE: Yes yes , I do .
CLYDE: Referring to line thirty-seven of the document , does your printed name and signature appear there ?
PETE: Yes it does .
CLYDE: Mr. Appleton , please tell this committee what was the nature and purpose of the `` Bread Instead of Bullets Club ? ''
PETE: Mr. Clyde , do you want to know what I knew then , or do you want to know what I know now ? They 're two different things ?
CLYDE: Start with what you knew then .
PETE: Well , I 'd direct the attention of counsel and committee to line thirty-six of the document , and the name printed and signed there .
CLYDE: We see it . For the record , it eads `` Lucille Angstrom . '' What 's the point of this ?
PETE: Well , that 's what I knew then . O who I knew , I should say . You see , I was trying to court Miss Angstrom . I went to the meeting to impress her .
CLYDE: Are you asking this committee to elieve that you attended a meeting of a communist party front organization in order to impress a girl ?
PETE: Well , if you 'd seen Miss Angstrom The audience LAUGHS . Doyle BANGS his gavel .
DOYLE: Chamber will come to order .
CLYDE: All right , Mr. Appleton . That was what you knew then . What do you know now ?
PETE: Well , I know that I lost my jo ecause of one meeting I went to when I was a kid in college . I know that I 've been branded a communist , which I 'm not , but even if I was , it should n't matter , o what do we have a Bill Of Rights for ?
CLYDE: Mr. Chairman , the witness is being non-responsive
PETE: I know that a lot of good , honest , decent people , people that I consider my true friends , feel etrayed by me , not because of who and what I am , but because of what you say I am ! I know that I
DOYLE: Mr. Appleton , you will respond to the questions of this committee without elaboration o speechmaking , or the chair will find you in Contempt Of Congress . You will not be warned again , is that clear ? Continue , Mr. Clyde .
CLYDE: Mr. Appleton
PETE: No , sir .
CLYDE: Are you refuting this evidence and your previous testimony ?
PETE: I 'm not refuting anything .
CLYDE: Yet you 're contradicting yourself . You earlier testified that you attended a meeting of a communist party-run organization , yet you just said , under oath , that you were not now nor ever a member of the communist party .
PETE: That 's not a contradiction at all , sir . I went to the meeting , but I did n't go as a member .
CLYDE: Well , then , as what did you go ? Beat . Pete smiles .
PETE: I 'm a little hesitant to say .
DOYLE: The witness need not be hesitant to say anything before this committee , as long as it 's the truth .
PETE: Well , I went as a horny young man .
ELDRIDGE: Damn , he do n't wan na spar with these boys . They 'll eat him alive .
DOYLE: Mr. Appleton , you are making light of a legally constituted committee of the United States Congress . Believe you me , you do not want to incur our wrath .
PETE: I 'm sorry , sir , I have no intention of making light of this committee . And I have no intention of incurring your wrath , Mr. Chairman . I have a few friends who have already incurred your wrath . They 've sent me letters from jail .
CLYDE: Mr. Chairman ! Mr. Chairman , the witness is making another speech . I would ask that Mr. Appleton be admonished
DOYLE: Mr. Appleton , there is no question efore you at this time , but I 'm sure Mr. Clyde has plenty more prepared , and if you 'd like to either answer them or plead the Fifth Amendment , we can at least get on with the business of this committee .
ADELE: Tell them Pete . Tell them
DOYLE: Well then , Mr. Appleton , just what is your intention ?
DOYLE: Go ahead , Mr. Appleton .
PETE: `` I , Peter Appleton , do hereby '' He stops suddenly . Pause .
DOYLE: Mr. Appleton ? Mr. Appleton ?
PETE: I I need a drink of water .
DOYLE: Go ahead , son .
PETE: Mr. Chairman there 's anothe Amendment that I 'd like to invoke at this time , but it 's not the Fifth Amendment . I wonder if you 're familiar with it .
DOYLE: Mr. Appleton , you will
PETE: `` Congress shall make no law especting an establishment of eligion , or prohibiting the free exercise thereof ; or abridging the freedom of speech , or of the press ; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble , and to petition the Government for a edress of grievances . '' Pause . Silence in the room .
PETE: And when you get right down to it , that 's really all I have to say to this committee . Good morning .
DOYLE: The witness will resume his seat ! Did you hear me ? ! You are not excused , Mr. Appleton !
CLYDE: Mr. Chairman ! Mr. Chairman !
FIRST REPORTER: There he is !
SECOND REPORTER: Pete ! Are you going back to writing pictures ?
PETE: I do n't know
THIRD REPORTER: You a commie , Pete ?
PETE: No , of course not
SECOND REPORTER: What about the girl , Pete ? You gon na marry her ? Is she coming to Hollywood , or are you
PETE: Look , fellas , I do n't have anything to say
PETE: I 'm not sorry for what I said .
LEO: No , of course not , why should you e sorry ? You 're the new Pete Appleton . You exercised you ights as a solid citizen , first amendment , freedom of speech , all that . Very noble .
PETE: No thanks .
LEO: When 'd you quit smoking ?
PETE: Luke did n't smoke .
LEO: Oh , I see . But you 're not Luke . You 're Peter Appleton , the picture writer .
PETE: Not any more .
LEO: Why not ?
PETE: Leo , you were in there , you saw what I did . You think they 're gon na let me write pictures ? Hell , they 're probably gon na throw my ass in jail .
LEO: Not at all .
PETE: Besides , I do n't even know if I want to write anymore .
LEO: What , you 're going to go back to that hick town and run the projector and marry the doctor 's daughter ? But before Pete can answer
PETE: What do you mean ?
LEO: Kid , you gave them what they wanted . This committee , it feeds on names . The more names , the etter . But for some high-profile witnesses , like yourself , any name will do .
PETE: Leo , I did n't give them the names . I would n't do that .
LEO: What , all of a sudden , `` Lucille Angstrom '' is n't a name ? Pete freezes . He slowly turns to Leo .
PETE: Her name was right there in front of them . They gave it to me , I did n't give it to them .
LEO: Well , that 's not what they think .
PETE: Leo , she was she was a girl I knew in college
LEO: You should keep track of your old school chums . Turns out she eventually joined the communist party . On top of which , she 's Lucy Angstrom Hirschfeld now , and she happens to be a writer for `` Studio One '' on CBS .
PETE: Oh god , oh , god , no , I
LEO: So , our lawyers had a talk with the Committee 's lawyers . That Elvin Clyde fella wo n't be too happy about it , but we cut a deal . They cleared you and they 're gon na thank you publicly for you testimony purging yourself .
PETE: Thank me publicly ? For what ? Fo uining this woman 's life ?
LEO: Climb down off your cross . They already knew about her . She was subpoenaed six months ago ! Who the hell do you think named you ?
SUPER: Here 's a new key for ya . That Mr. Kubelsky , he 's got you paid up through this month . You got one swell friend there . The Super moves to the door and turns back .
PETE: Thanks
PETE: Western Union , please .
BOB: Luke um , I mean , Pete , if it were n't for you , I would n't have had the nerve to ask this fine woman to marry me . Mabel 's mouth drops open .
PETE: Bob , congratulations ! When 'd you ask her ?
MABEL: Holy moley ! Just now ! Yes , Bob ! Yes !
PETE: I see you got the telegram .
ADELE: Pete , I 'm so sorry about what they did to you . I did n't think you 'd come back , I thought you 'd want to write again
PETE: Dell , I ca n't write unless I 'm happy , and I ca n't be happy unless I 'm here and with you . This is me , Delly . Pete Appleton . And I love you !
ADELE: And I love you , Pete !
PETE: C'mon , Dell , we got ta go . Showtime in fifteen minutes .
THELMA: Spring training starts the twelfth . How do you think the Indians will do this year ?
VIC: They do n't look too good .
BUSINESS EXECUTIVE: They do n't look particularly good , do they ?
LONGSHOREMEN: I 'll tell ya . They do n't look very fuckin ' good .
GROUNDSKEEPER: They 're shitty .
DONOVAN: Thirty minutes late . Think she 'll show ?
MATTHEWS: She 's got to . She 's the damn owne now .
DONOVAN: She did n't last week . She was having a guava facial .
RACHEL: Good morning , gentlemen . Welcome to another season of Indians ' baseball .
SIMMONS: I never heard of half these guys . And the ones I do know are way past their prime .
DONOVAN: Most of these guys never had a prime .
BUTLER: This guy here is dead .
RACHEL: Cross him off then .
BUTLER: Let 's not be hasty .
RACHEL: It 's time to shake things up , Charlie . Clear the board and start over .
DONOVAN: Well , it 's not the best material I 've ever had to work with , but I 'll do my best to see we move up a notch this year .
RACHEL: I know you will , Charlie . That 's why I 'm movin ' you up to General Manager . Congratulations .
MATTHEWS: One minute , 58 seconds .
RACHEL: Come on in , Charlie . Have a seat .
DONOVAN: I 'm glad you called me in . I 'm still unclear on a couple things
RACHEL: Oh , really ? Like what ?
DONOVAN: Well , if I 'm the G.M. , who 's gon na e the Manager ?
RACHEL: I was thinking of Lou Brown .
DONOVAN: Lou Brown ?
RACHEL: He 's managed the Toledo Mud Hens of the International League for the last 30 years .
DONOVAN: What exactly is our team concept ?
RACHEL: That 's what I wanted to talk to you about . I want to put together a team that will help us relocate to Miami .
DONOVAN: What do you mean ? Some of these guys are furniture movers ?
RACHEL: I 'm serious about this , Charlie . It 's no secret I 've never liked Cleveland much . The weather 's lousy , downtown is a pit , the stadium 's falling apart , and we ca n't draw dick . Another couple of years of this and I 'm gon na have to start feeding Cha-Cha dog food .
DONOVAN: Mrs. Phelps , you ca n't just up and move a team on a whim
RACHEL: It 's hardly a whim . Miami 's offered to build us a new stadium 62,000 capacity , 45 V.I.P . boxes , and no ent for the first million at the gate . Plus a 12 million dollar media guarantee ; 45 percent of the concession gross , all of the parking and they pick up the stadium operations costs . No other franchise in baseball can match that deal .
DONOVAN: Even so , the League 'll never let us leave Cleveland . We got a lease with the city .
RACHEL: The lease says we have the right to move if our attendance falls below 800,000 for the year . Paragraph 40 , line 17 .
DONOVAN: What are you saying ? You want us to lose ?
RACHEL: No , we 've been losing . What I want us to do is finish dead last .
DONOVAN: Mister Phelps would never have approved of this .
RACHEL: He knew it had to be done . He just did n't have the courage to do it . Hopefully , you will come to see the wisdom of it . If this team lives up to its potential , we could have the worst ecord in all baseball . On Donovan 's sunken face , we go to
TAYLOR: Yeh .
DONOVAN: Hello , Jake ? This is Charlie Donovan , new G.M . of the Cleveland Indians .
TAYLOR: Yeh
DONOVAN: I wanted to call and say the organization remembers you fondly from the years you played here and we 'd love to have you come to spring training for a shot at this year 's club .
TAYLOR: Who is this ?
DONOVAN: What ?
TAYLOR: Is that you , Tolbert ? This is n't very funny , ya know . I 'm hung over . My knees are killin ' me . If you were gon na pull this shit , you could 've at least said you were from the Yankees .
TOLBERT: Who the hell were you talkin ' to ? On Taylor 's reaction , we
SECRETARY: Lines three and four are waiting fo you , Mr. Brown . One guy about the TR- 70 's .
BROWN: Tire World .
DONOVAN: Lou ? This is Charlie Donovan , the new G.M . of the Cleveland Indians . Listen , Lou , I hope you 're sittin ' down 'cause I got an offer you probably been dreamin ' about you whole life . We been watchin ' you progress down there at Toledo with a lotta interest and well How would you like to manage the Indians this year ?
BROWN: I do n't know
DONOVAN: What do ya mean you do n't know ? This is a chance to manage in the big leagues .
BROWN: Lem me think it over , will ya , Charlie . I got a guy on the other line about some whitewalls . I 'll talk to ya later .
DONOVAN: Rick , we heard about your pitching out at Portland last year
VAUGHN: I 'm , ah , not with them anymore
DONOVAN: We 'd still like to take a look at ya at our spring camp in Arizona , March first .
VAUGHN: Yeh , well , I 'm not sure I can make it by then .
DONOVAN: Do n't worry , we 're gettin ' you out on a sort of work furlough deal . Any questions ?
VAUGHN: Yeh . Where 's Cleveland ?
DONOVAN: Look , Lou , you been in baseball thirty years . Do n't you wan na advance some ?
BROWN: I used to coach the unwed mothers ' softball team . I have advanced some .
DONOVAN: Well , what are you really worried about ? The money ?
BROWN: Naw , I 'm just not sure I 'd be happy in a big organization like that . Owners are always on your back , tryin ' to `` help you out . ''
DONOVAN: I do n't think that 's gon na be a problem .
BROWN: Down here baseball 's a game , not a usiness . I do n't wanta be a abysitter for a buncha millionaires who think they know it all already .
DONOVAN: We do n't have any millionaires .
BROWN: Well then , bonus babies or whateve you got
DONOVAN: Do n't have any bonus babies either .
BROWN: Do n't you have any proven major league talent ?
DONOVAN: Not that I know of .
BROWN: Well , then I 'll be up in a couple days .
DONOVAN: What ?
BROWN: Sounds like my kinda team . Have my contracts ready . Brown hangs up .
DONOVAN: Guess I really put the screws to him .
MANAGER: Taylor , telephone for you .
TAYLOR: Hello .
DONOVAN: Jake , Charlie Donovan again .
TAYLOR: Oh yeh , Charlie , look , I 'm sorry about this morning
DONOVAN: No problem . Look , Jake , camp starts on the first . Can you make it ?
TAYLOR: Sure .
DONOVAN: You been stayin ' in shape down there ?
TAYLOR: Oh hell , yeh , I work out every day .
DONOVAN: I thought so . See ya in Arizona .
MANAGER: Let 's go , Taylor . You 're up .
TAYLOR: Luis , I 'm not gon na be playin ' anymore . I got a tryout in the States .
MANAGER: Fine . Leave your uniform .
TAYLOR: But I changed at the motel .
MANAGER: Leave your uniform .
DONOVAN: This looks like Jake Taylor .
BROWN: He was an Allstar in Boston , was n't he ?
DONOVAN: Yeh .
PEPPER: Wish we had him two years ago .
DONOVAN: We did .
PEPPER: Four years ago then .
TAYLOR: What happened to the private rooms ?
TEMPLE: We 're on an austerity program . This is what happens when you finish 24 games out .
BROWN: Who 's that ?
DONOVAN: I think it 's Cerrano . Defected from Cuba . Wanted religious freedom .
BROWN: What 's his religion ?
DONOVAN: Voodoo .
BROWN: Thought you did n't have any high- priced talent .
DONOVAN: I forgot about Dorn , 'cause he 's only high-priced . Got him as a free agent three years ago .
BROWN: Still hits the ball pretty well , does n't he ?
DONOVAN: Yeh , he just ca n't field it . Dorn pulls his golf clubs out of the car .
BROWN: We 'll shape him up .
DONOVAN: Do n't recognize this guy . Hayes strolls up and introduces himself .
HAYES: Say hey , Willie Mays Hayes here . I play like Mays and run like Hayes .
BROWN: Lou Brown . Nice to meet ya , Hayes .
HAYES: Thanks . Well , I got ta get my stuff Hayes hustles off toward his car .
DONOVAN: I do n't remember a Hayes on the list .
PEPPER: Look at this fuckin ' guy .
TEMPLE: Maybe he 's the mascot .
DORN: Hey , what do we have here ? Guy looks like a fuckin ' toilet brush . Hey , T.B. , I love your pony tail . And the earring 's cute too . Where 's the matching bracelet ?
TAYLOR: Jake Taylor . Vaughn shakes it and nods . Says nothing .
VAUGHN: Vaughn . Rick Vaughn .
TAYLOR: Forget about Dorn . He 's always a little tough on rookies . You 'll get a lot worse from other teams .
HAYES: Say hey ! How ya doin ' ? Willie Mays Hayes here .
TAYLOR: Jake Taylor . Rick Vaughn .
HAYES: What the hell league you been playin ' in ?
VAUGHN: California Penal .
HAYES: Never heard of it . How 'd you wind up playin ' there ?
VAUGHN: I stole a car . On Hayes ' look , we
GUARD: This guy was n't invited to camp .
BROWN: Welcome to Spring Training , gentlemen . Most managers tell you at this time that all the jobs are open , that nobody 's a lock at any position , and that talent is n't everything . They 'd ather see desire and discipline in a player . Then they tell you that most of all they want you to have fun out there , even though they 're gon na work your ass off on fundamentals and condition you till you drop . The difference between me and those other managers is I mean it . On a locker room full of uneasy faces , we
HAYES: Shit , I been cut already ?
PEPPER: 11.9 Taylor . Not bad if you 'd fallen down .
BROWN: Get him a uniform .
HARRIS: C'mon , Hayes , let 's do 'em right .
HAYES: Hey , my philosophy is no pain , no pain .
BROWN: How the knees holdin ' up , Jake ?
TAYLOR: Great . Never been better .
BROWN: Mobility 's good ? No problem gettin ' off the throw to second ?
TAYLOR: No problem .
BROWN: I need a catcher , Jake . Somebody who can keep this team together on the field . You were a helluva playe when you were sound , but around the league they think you ca n't take the pounding anymore .
TAYLOR: Around the league they 're wrong .
BROWN: I 'm gon na have to put you to the test , ya know . So , I want the absolute truth here . Are you 100 percent ?
TAYLOR: Yeh . Would I bullshit about somethin ' like that ?
BROWN: You better if you wan na make this team .
HAYES: My stroke 'll come back once I get warmed up .
TEMPLE: Never did get warmed up last year . Hit .211 at Maine . I looked him up .
BROWN: I think Mr. Hayes shows some promise . His speed could be a big asset .
PEPPER: For what ? Running back to the dugout ?
BROWN: You got ta stop swingin ' for the fences though , Hayes . All you 're gon na do is give yourself a hernia . With you speed you should be hittin ' the ball on the ground , leggin ' 'em out . Every time I see you hit one in the air , you owe me twenty pushups .
HAYES: Hey , no problem .
BROWN: Sometimes you can teach a guy to hit . You ca n't teach him to run .
PEPPER: Sounded like it .
TAYLOR: Sorry , Lou , I was n't quite expectin ' that much octane .
BROWN: How much ?
CLUBHOUSE MAN: 96 miles an hour .
BROWN: Better teach him some control before he kills somebody .
BROWN: C'mon , Dorn , get in front of the damn ball . Do n't give me this ole ' bullshit .
DORN: I took one of these in the eye last year . Nearly lost my sight .
BROWN: I 'm deeply moved . Every time you play it off your hip , you give me forty sit-ups .
DORN: What ! That 's Little League shit .
BROWN: So is this .
BROWN: Jesus , this guy hits a ton . How come nobody else picked up on him ?
TEMPLE: Okay , Harris , that 's enough fast alls . Throw some curves .
BROWN: Oh . Dorn approaches Brown at the cage .
DORN: Lou , I wan na have a word with you here .
BROWN: Sure .
DORN: Those penalty sit-ups you want me to do ? I got it right here in my contract that I do n't have to do any calisthenics I do n't feel are necessary . What do ya think of that ?
PEPPER: We got anybody left playin ' baseball out there ?
TAYLOR: Shit , the way I played today , I would n't be surprised if they red- tagged me already .
HAYES: What do ya mean ?
TAYLOR: Red tag in your locker means the manager wants to see you , 'cause you just died and went to the minors .
VAUGHN: What is that stuff ?
HARRIS: Crisco , Bardahl , Vagisil . Any one of 'em will give you another 2-3 inches drop on your curve ball . Vaughn ca n't believe this .
VAUGHN: You put snot on the ball ?
HARRIS: At my age , you put anything you can find on it . I have n't got an arm like yours . Vaughn just looks at him incredulous .
TAYLOR: What are you doin ' there , Pedro ?
CERRANO: Bats . They are sick .
TAYLOR: So are mine . Is somethin ' goin ' around ?
CERRANO: No hit curve ball . Straight ball , hit it very much . Curve ball , bats are afraid . I ask Jo-Buu to come . Take fear from bats .
HAYES: Jo-Buu ?
TAYLOR: Maybe he 's the pagan saint of aseball .
CERRANO: I offer him cigars and gin . He will come .
HARRIS: I would n't leave this gin sittin ' around out here with this group .
CERRANO: Is very bad to steal Jo-Buu 's gin . Is very bad .
VAUGHN: This is final cut down day , right ?
TAYLOR: Yeh , better get your snake ready , Hayes .
HAYES: No , I 'm goin ' cold turkey today . My hands are too screwed up to hold it anyway . Hayes reveals a pair of red and cut hands .
TAYLOR: If you 're gon na use that head first slide , you better get yourself some gloves or you 're not gon na have any skin left on your hands . They 've reached the locker room now .
VAUGHN: I do n't wan na go in there .
TAYLOR: Whatever happens , keep it to yourself until you 're outta the locker room . Do n't celebrate in front of guys who just died .
HAYES: What if we 're one of the deceased ?
HAYES: C'mon , Vaughn , let 's show some nuts here . If they cut us , we 'll just sign with the Yankees .
BROWN: Good , I like that kinda spirit in a player . The only problem is , I did n't cut you .
VAUGHN: What do you mean ?
BROWN: I think somebody 's been havin ' fun with you .
DORN: What 's the matter , little lady ? Ca n't you take a joke ?
BROWN: Can I have your attention , please ? I counted up your ballots for team captain and I think you chose the ight guy . If you had n't , I woulda told you he won anyway . Mr. C fo the year Jake Taylor .
TAYLOR: Forget about Dorn . You got othe things to do .
VAUGHN: Like what ?
TAYLOR: Packing for Cleveland .
THELMA: You see the new lineup the Indians got ?
BOBBY: I never heard of most of 'em .
BUSINESS EXECUTIVE: I do n't know the majority of these names .
LONGSHOREMAN: Who are these fuckin ' guys ?
GROUNDSKEEPER: They 're shitty .
TAYLOR: Two down . Bottom of the ninth .
HAYES: Really got all of that one .
VAUGHN: What was it ? A slider ? Taylor is too embarrassed to reply .
TAYLOR: What are you gon na have ?
HAYES: I do n't know . What language is this ?
TAYLOR: French .
HAYES: They got patty melts over there ?
TAYLOR: Forget it . I 'll order . Let 's have a toast . The three raise their wine glasses .
VAUGHN: What is it ? The chick ?
TAYLOR: That 's my wife .
HAYES: Does she know it ?
TAYLOR: I mean she woulda been if I had n't screwed it up . Who 's that guy she 's with ?
HAYES: I do n't know . He 's not wearing a name tag .
VAUGHN: You want me to beat the shit out of him ?
TAYLOR: No .
HAYES: What does she do ?
TAYLOR: She 's a librarian .
VAUGHN: A librarian ? Shit , I got ta start eadin ' again .
WAITER: Miss Wells , there 's a telephone call for you .
LYNN: Hello .
VOICE: Hello , Lynn . It 's Jake .
LYNN: Jake ? How did you know I was here ?
TAYLOR: Just a hunch . I took you there when you got your masters . I figure you 're probably wearing the black velvet dress with the red sash .
LYNN: How did you know that ? I did n't have this dress when we were
TAYLOR: You look great .
LYNN: Thanks . What are you doin ' here ? Are n't you supposed to be in Mexico somewhere ?
TAYLOR: I 'm playin ' with the Indians again . Back in the Bigs .
LYNN: That 's great . I 'm happy for you , Jake .
TAYLOR: Wait a minute . What 's your number . I tried calling you at home , but you 're not listed
LYNN: My life is different from when you knew me .
TAYLOR: Meaning what ? That I do n't know you anymore ?
LYNN: Could n't we talk about this some other time ? I really got ta
TAYLOR: Okay , just gim me your number .
LYNN: I do n't think that 's a good idea .
TAYLOR: Why not ? Because of the guy you 're with ? What is he , a banker ?
LYNN: Lawyer . Please , Jake , he 's watching us .
TAYLOR: I 'm not leavin ' without your number . You still wear those great little tortoise-shell glasses ? I always loved it when you took them off .
LYNN: Jake
TAYLOR: The number , Lynn
LYNN: All right . 555-9314 .
TAYLOR: Thank you . I 'm back , Lynn , and I 'm gon na be around .
CABBIE: What 's the number again ?
HAYES: What is this place ?
TAYLOR: Furnished apartment building owned y the Indians . We get special rates . With what we 're makin ' we 'll need it .
CABBIE: That 's it .
TAYLOR: Welcome to the Big Leagues .
BROWN: All right , let 's gather 'round . The players turn their attention to Brown .
HARRIS: Are n't we gon na have a prayer ? I mean we 're not all savages like Cerrano .
BROWN: You guys go ahead . I belong to the church of three-run homers .
HARRIS: All right , let 's bow our heads .
CERRANO: Have to wake up bats .
HARRIS: Dear Lord , we ask
JOHNNY: You read the Plain Dealer today ? They said this is gon na be the worst Indian team we 've had in years .
THELMA: Everybody laughs at the Indians now , ut there were other times . Even won the Series in '48 . Then Willie Mays made that catch on Vic Wertz in the '54 Series and Cleveland 's neve een the same since .
JOHNNY: As the Indians go so goes Cleveland , huh ?
THELMA: If we ever lost the Indians , Cleveland would die .
DOYLE: Hello , everybody , Harry Doyle here , welcoming all you Friends of the Feather to another season of Indians aseball . A lotta new faces for the tribe this year , as they take on the defending American League champs , the New York Yankees . And listen to the roar of the crowd as the Indians takes the field !
BROWN: All right , way to look , way to look . Nice catch , Hayes . Do n't ever fuckin ' do it again . Okay , let 's get it goin ' !
DOYLE: Bottom of the first , Willie Mays Hayes to lead it off for the tribe .
DOYLE: And so the string is broken . Maybe things will turn around a little fo the Indians this year .
BLEACHER BAND: In the land of burning waters , waters Lurks the Injun nine , oh so fine , we Love those mighty Redmen , Turn thei foes to dead men , Ummmmm .
FIRST BASEMAN: Showed some real power on that one , Slugger .
HAYES: I plan to get at least a double out of it .
FIRST BASEMAN: You look real sharp , but you 'll neve steal second with your shoe untied .
DOYLE: Well , so much for that .
TAYLOR'S VOICE: Guy 's goin ' . Got ta be goin ' get the throw up . Do n't bounce the damn all .
DOYLE: Top of the sixth . Rookie sensation , Ricky Vaughn , on to pitch now . You can close the book on Winters
TAYLOR: Easy does it , Ricky . We 're only fou down . We 're still in this thing .
PEPPER: Do n't worry if you 're off the plate on a few pitches . Does n't hurt to put the fear of God in a hitter .
YANKEE HITTER: This guy kinda wild ?
TAYLOR: I figure you got a 30 % chance to survive this at bat .
BOBBY: Wild thing , You make my heart sing , You walk everything . Pepper has reached the mound
PEPPER: Okay kid . I think we got 'em scared enough now . Time to get a few of 'em out . Vaughn nods . He 's plenty upset with himself .
HAYWOOD: Hey , Taylor , what you doin ' back up here ?
TAYLOR: Could n't cut it in the Mexican League .
VAUGHN: Oh , shit
PEPPER: Looked like a strike anyway . You want me to go get him ?
BROWN: No , let 's see how he reacts .
PEPPER: At least he hit what he was aimin ' at .
BROWN: I think you can go get him now .
PEPPER: C'mon , kid . As soon as Coleman gets up , he 's gon na be lookin ' for you .
DOYLE: So , a tough start for the Erie warriors , as they drop a heartbreake to the Yankees , nine to nothing . The Post Game Show was brought to you y Christ . I ca n't find it . The hell with it . This is Harry Doyle saying good night , everybody , and Happy Hunting . With that Doyle passes out on his face .
RACHEL: We 're off to a good start , gentlemen . Let 's keep it up .
VAUGHN: God , I was horse shit tonight .
TAYLOR: Only thing you got to be sorry about was hittin ' Coleman .
VAUGHN: What ?
TAYLOR: If you wanted to send a message , it shoulda been to Haywood . He hit the damn homer . Coleman was just picking his nose in the on-deck circle . Vaughn nods slowly .
VAUGHN: Oh yeh , name one .
TAYLOR: Yellowstone .
VAUGHN: Shit
LYNN: Jake , you should n't have come here .
TAYLOR: I was wonderin ' why you 'd give an old friend a bum phone number .
LYNN: Let 's talk in my office , okay ?
TAYLOR: I do n't wan na talk in your office .
LYNN: I told you I do n't think it 's a good idea for us to see each other .
TAYLOR: Why not ?
LYNN: We do n't have anything in common . Sometimes I wonder if we ever did .
TAYLOR: What are you talkin ' about ? We were oth athletes , world class , hot fo each other . What more can you have in common ?
LYNN: I stopped bein ' an athlete three years ago . Books are my life now . Jake suppresses a smile .
TAYLOR: So what is it ? You 're still sore I never read Moby Dick ?
LYNN: You never read anything I asked you to .
TAYLOR: Not like what's-his-name at the estaurant ?
LYNN: His name is Tom , and keep your voice down .
TAYLOR: What do ya see in this guy ?
LYNN: He 's stable . He 's intelligent and I 've never found him in bed with a stewardess .
TAYLOR: That 's 'cause no stewardess would have him . Would n't you rather be with somebody who 's in demand ?
LYNN: Just like always , you do n't take anything seriously . Everything 's a joke to you .
TAYLOR: C'mon , Lynn , for Christ sake , I 'm just tryin ' to loosen things up a little . I 'm gettin ' frostbite here . Lynn stops and turns to face him .
LYNN: Tom and I are getting married in the fall .
TAYLOR: What ? That 's crazy , Lynn . I got plans for us .
LYNN: What plans ?
TAYLOR: I was gon na play another a year o two , then we go to Hawaii , and have a couple kids who grow up to be Olympic champions .
LYNN: How can you think stuff like that ? I have n't seen you in two years . You never even wrote me a letter .
TAYLOR: I 'm sorry , Lynn , but I was n't exactly proud of my situation . C'mon , you did n't think about me at all since I een gone ?
LYNN: Not so loud , Jake .
TAYLOR: Remember the three nights we spent on the beach in Vera Cruz ? You have nights like that with Mr. Briefcase ?
LYNN: What about the night you had in Detroit with Miss Dairy Queen ? They 're in the large reading room now .
TAYLOR: What was I supposed to do ? She bet me fifty bucks she had a better body than you . I had to defend your honor .
LYNN: What a bunch of bullshit ! I have a much better body than she does .
TAYLOR: She 's right . Take it from me , she eally does . I mean Miss Dairy Queen has quantity , I give her that , but the , ah , quality just is n't there . Nice job , Jake . Lynn is still mortified .
LYNN: You have n't changed at all , have you ?
TAYLOR: I 'm afraid I have or I would n't be here . C'mon , Lynn , I do n't wan na do time for things that happened years ago .
LYNN: I 'm sorry , Jake . You 'll always be the little boy who would n't grow up . Lynn starts off for her office door .
TAYLOR: Lynn , wait
RACHEL: A quarter of the season 's gone , we 're 15 and 24 , seven games out of first . Our attendance is just below 180,000 . That 's bad , but not bad enough .
DONOVAN: Projected over the whole season , we stand to wind up 36 games under .500 and 28 out of first . That should be ad enough for anybody .
RACHEL: We finished 24 out last year and still drew 890,000 . When school 's out for the summer , attendance is liable to rise . Plus , this team is showing signs of improvement . I did n't think we 'd win 15 games all year . Any ideas ?
DONOVAN: On how we can get worse ? How about a series of fines for good play ? Maybe a $ 30,000 bonus to the guy chosen Least Valuable Player .
RACHEL: This is no laughing matter , Donovan . I think maybe the problem is we 're coddling these guys too much .
HAYES: What 's with this ? We never leave from this terminal .
TAYLOR: Maybe the other one 's jammed up .
HAYES: Which one is ours ?
GATEMAN: That one .
TAYLOR: What is this , Lou ?
BROWN: Front office says it 's an economy measure , 'cause we 're not drawin ' good .
TAYLOR: Well , they certainly have spared every expense .
HARRIS: Oh , so now you come around . He 's not fooled .
HAYES: Call the stewardess , Vaughn . I need one of those bags .
VAUGHN: There are n't any stewardesses .
HAYES: I wonder if there 's any pilots .
DOYLE: Two down , top of the ninth . Last chance for the red and blue .
STAT MAN: You ca n't say `` fuckin ' '' on the air .
DOYLE: Do n't worry about it . Nobody 's listening anyway .
HARRIS: Who you got lined up tonight ?
DORN: Where are we ? Kansas City , right ? Got ta be Arlene
HARRIS: You call her ?
DORN: Do n't have to . She knows when I 'm in town .
TAYLOR: I 'm about ready to turn in . I 've anesthetized my knees enough . A GUY from the bar approaches the table .
GUY: Excuse me , Mr. Vaughn , can I have your autograph ?
VAUGHN: Ah yeh sure . My first autograph . I could n't give these away a couple weeks ago .
GUY: I saw your record on the news . You made their Hall of Shame . Congratulations .
VAUGHN: Thanks .
TAYLOR: You 're a celebrity now , Vaughn .
VAUGHN: I thought you had to do somethin ' good to be a celebrity .
TAYLOR: Not if you do it colorfully .
DORN: What 'd I tell ya .
ARLENE: Hi , Rodger . This is Vicki and Rene .
DORN: Hi , doll . This is Steve Harris .
ARLENE: Where 's your buddy Gant ?
DORN: They cut him to make room for bristle oy over there .
ARLENE: Is that Vaughn , the guy they call Wild Thing ?
DORN: Yeh .
ARLENE: He 's kinda cute . They say he could e a big star .
DORN: What are you talkin ' about ? He could n't find the plate if it was magnetized . He wo n't last the year .
ARLENE: He struck out five in a row before the wild pitches . Maybe I 'll check him out .
DORN: Wait a minute , you 're with me .
ARLENE: I do n't remember you makin ' any date .
DORN: Since when do I have to make a date ? Who 's been showin ' you this town the last three years ?
ARLENE: Ancient history , Rodger . I got ta look out for myself now . I do n't have to be a slave to no .235 hitter .
TAYLOR: Guess we 're over with , eh , Dorn ?
DORN: Speak for yourself , Taylor . I got a couple good years left .
HAYES: `` Moby Dick ? '' What is that ?
TAYLOR: It 's one of the masterpieces of American literature , that 's all .
HAYES: Lynn put you on to this ?
TAYLOR: Long time ago .
HAYES: Well , we 're goin ' to a club tonight . You wan na come along ?
TAYLOR: No , I got some more reading to do .
HAYES: What , you got a test or somethin ' ? Why do n't you just go over and see her ? Maybe she 'll let you slide on a couple of these .
TAYLOR: I might if I knew where she lives .
HAYES: Easy . Tail her home from the library .
TAYLOR: You mean sit in a car and wait fo her to come out ? That 's kinda juvenile , do n't you think ?
HAYES: Yeh .
LYNN: This is n't my place
TAYLOR: Whose place is it ?
TOM: Who 's there , love ? Oh , Mr. Taylor , right ? I remember you from the restaurant . Lynn 's told me a lot about you . Why do n't you come in for a while ?
TAYLOR: Nah , that 's o.k. , I got some things to do
LYNN: Yeh , he 's got ta be goin '
TOM: No , really , come on in for a drink .
TAYLOR: I , ah , just had a couple books I wanted to discuss with Lynn . I thought this was her place .
TOM: Well , it soon will be .
TAYLOR: Yeh , I heard you guys were engaged . Congratulations .
TOM: Thank you . What can I get you to drink ?
TAYLOR: Beer 'll be fine . Tom goes off to get the beer .
JACK: What team do you play for , Jake ?
TAYLOR: The Indians .
CLAIRE: Here in Cleveland ? I did n't know they still had a team .
TAYLOR: Yeh , we have uniforms and everything . It 's really great .
TOM: They 're last right now , but hopefully moving up , eh , Jake ?
JANICE: I 'm told that baseball players make very good salaries these days .
TAYLOR: That depends on how good they are , I guess .
JANICE: How good are you ? Lynn is irritated by Janice 's directness .
TAYLOR: I make the League minimum .
LYNN: He was one of the best in baseball until he had problems with his knees .
TOM: What are you going to do when you career ends ? I mean you ca n't play aseball forever , can you ?
TAYLOR: Somethin 'll come up .
TOM: Will it ?
TAYLOR: I do n't know , I was thinkin ' of goin ' to Hawaii , and having a couple of kids who grow up to be Olympic champions .
JACK: Oh really . In what event ?
TAYLOR: Swimming . Maybe the two hundred mete Individual Medley . I figure it oughta e big by then . Jack just nods . He never heard of it .
BRENT: You got the girl picked out ?
TAYLOR: I did , but I was n't smart enough to hold on to her . Lynn 's eyes drop to the floor .
BRENT: You used to be an athlete , did n't you , Lynn ?
LYNN: Yes .
BRENT: What did you do ?
LYNN: Two Hundred Individual medley .
TAYLOR: Alternate on the '80 Olympic Team . A tense silence settles on the group .
TOM: Let me walk you out .
TAYLOR: Thanks for the beer .
TOM: Do n't mention it .
TAYLOR: I 'll let you know if I land a good job . I know you 're concerned about it .
TOM: Yeh , well , I just wanted Lynn to know what she would 've had ahead of her .
TAYLOR: Suck my dick .
PEPPER: Lou wants to see you down at the office , Rick .
BROWN: C'mon in , Rick .
VAUGHN: What about Koufax ?
BROWN: Never mind Koufax .
VAUGHN: You gon na send me to the minors ?
BROWN: Nope .
VAUGHN: These things make me look ridiculous .
TAYLOR: Drop in the bucket , Vaughn .
VAUGHN: What 's that for ?
CERRANO: Gin and cigarettes not enough for Jo- Buu . I still can no hit curva ball for sheet . I hafta make a sacrifice to him .
TAYLOR: Sacrifice ? You mean like something living ?
CERRANO: Si . I kill unborn children .
HARRIS: Not while I 'm here you 're not . That 's murder .
BROWN: All right , let 's hit the field .
HARRIS: Here 's looking at ya , Jo-Buu .
PEPPER: You want me to go get him ?
BROWN: No , he 's come this far . Let 's see if he can finish it .
DOYLE: Vaughn in a little trouble here , but I 'll tell ya , these Cleveland fans are great . Listen to them get behind Vaughn .
BOBBY: We need some defense here . Maybe we oughta do a wave .
JOHNNY: C'mon , Indians do n't do waves . Let 's keep this thing pure .
VIC: What harm could it do ?
TAYLOR: Forget the runners , Ricky , get this guy at the plate .
DOYLE: High ball two , and the crowd does n't like that call one bit .
TAYLOR: Okay , let 's get nasty here , Rick . You know he 's lookin ' for this pitch . Got ta come up with somethin ' studly .
VAUGHN: Fuckin ' Dorn . Game shoulda been ove y now . Dorn coulda had that ball . He tanked it on purpose .
TAYLOR: This is n't the California Penal League , Vaughn . We 're professionals here . We do n't tank a play fo personal reasons , so cut the crybaby shit . You 've pitched a helluva game . You wan na finish it , do n't ya ? Vaughn nods .
VAUGHN: Yeh , but I do n't know if there 'll be much on it . My arm feels like jello .
TAYLOR: Just make sure it 's over the plate . I want him to swing .
VAUGHN: The last time I did that , the guy hit one that has n't landed yet .
TAYLOR: Do n't worry , I 'll take care of it .
VAUGHN: I was bored .
TAYLOR: Next time you might think about takin ' in a movie or somethin ' .
REXMAN: .316 .
TAYLOR: Hey , nice average . Uh oh , on second thought , that still means you got a seven outta ten chance of goin ' in the dumper .
REXMAN: Shut up , will ya , Taylor ?
TAYLOR: Hey , I can understand not wantin ' to talk about baseball when your nuts are in a vice like this . Rexman gets back in the box .
BROWN: It 's startin ' to come together , Pepper . It 's startin ' to come together .
SUZANNE: Oh hi , Jake , how are you ?
TAYLOR: Fine , Suzanne , can I have a quick word with Rodger ?
SUZANNE: Sure , c'mon in , he 's in the den . I 'll get some coffee .
DORN: Hey , Jake , old boy , what brings you out here ?
TAYLOR: I just wanta tell ya somethin ' , but I did n't want to do it in front of the whole team .
DORN: Sure , go ahead .
TAYLOR: I do n't know what your problem is , ut if I ever see you tank anothe play like you did tonight , I 'll cut off your nuts and stuff 'em down your fuckin ' throat .
SUZANNE: Coffee anybody ?
HAYES: Why the hell are we havin ' practice during the All-Star break ?
TAYLOR: I heard the Big Lady upstairs ordered it .
VAUGHN: It 's hotter than shit in here . What happened to the air conditioning ?
BROWN: Oh man , this old body can use a soak .
DORN: Forget it . It 's not workin ' again .
BROWN: Damn it , I thought they were gon na eplace this thing .
HARRIS: Hey , there 's no hot water in here .
BROWN: She 's at it again . I 've had it with this nickel and dime stuff . I 'm gon na get the Bitch on the phone .
RACHEL: You wanted to see the Bitch ?
BROWN: Yeh .
RACHEL: Do n't you think you oughta cove yourself with a towel first , Mr. Brown ?
BROWN: There are n't any towels , and I 'm too old to be diving under benches .
RACHEL: Well , I can take it if you can .
BROWN: What happened to the new whirlpool we were supposed to get ?
RACHEL: Revenue problems have forced us to cut back on equipment . We 'll simply have to fix the old one .
BROWN: You fixed it six times already . And now there 's no hot water in the showers .
RACHEL: The pipes in this building are old and rusted . We 're replacing them , ut it 's a long , expensive process .
BROWN: How am I supposed to keep my players healthy with cold water and no therapy equipment ?
RACHEL: Your players will just have to get a little tougher . What are they , a unch of pansies ?
BROWN: Over 162 games even tough guys get sprains , sore arms , muscle pulls
RACHEL: It 's only temporary . Besides , these guys were n't playing that good when the equipment was workin ' . If I could get anybody to come and watch this team , none of this would be necessary . You oughta be grateful I can still pay your salaries .
FARMER: In case you have n't noticed , and judging by attendance , you have n't , the Indians , that thought-to-be hopeless collection of has-been 's and never-will-be 's is actually approaching the .500 mark , and with it , semi-respectability . Nothing to write home about , to be sure , but at least we do n't have to cover ou eyes .
VIC: Ya know , they could be a lot worse .
BUSINESS EXECUTIVE: Ya know , I may have underestimated this team a bit .
LONGSHOREMAN: Ya know , these guys are n't so fuckin ' ad .
GROUNDSKEEPER: They 're still shitty .
TAYLOR: Ah shit , here comes Lou . Gim me a eak , Mel . I got ta get outta here .
WINGO: All right , kick some dirt on me . The Commissioner 'll buy that .
TAYLOR: Right . Good idea .
BROWN: Hey , do n't you go anywhere . I wan na have a few words with you . Brown grabs Taylor and pulls him aside .
TAYLOR: Fucker called that a ball .
BROWN: You mean the one that was a foot outside ?
TAYLOR: Yeh .
TAYLOR: You still got that great kick . Just like the first time I ever saw you .
LYNN: You follow me here too ?
TAYLOR: Yeh , what did you want to see me about ?
LYNN: What do you mean ?
TAYLOR: You would n't have been at the game if you did n't want to see me about something .
LYNN: I just wanted to see you play .
TAYLOR: How was I ?
LYNN: You looked good , but you oughta open your stance a little . They 're pitching you inside .
TAYLOR: I 'll try that . You wan na have some dinner ?
LYNN: Sorry , I already ate .
TAYLOR: Right . I forgot your life is different now .
LYNN: Thanks for the race .
TAYLOR: Anytime .
LYNN: Mine . You follow me again ?
TAYLOR: Yeh . When I saw you at the game , I figured you wanted to see me about something .
LYNN: I just wanted to see you play .
TAYLOR: How was I ?
LYNN: You looked good , but you oughta open your stance a little . They 're pitchin ' you inside .
TAYLOR: I 'll try that .
LYNN: I think I oughta tell you that I 'm moving in with Tom .
TAYLOR: Goin ' uptown , huh ?
LYNN: I 'm not goin ' uptown , I just want to lead a regular life . You know , like an adult maybe . With a house and a garden and normal hours .
TAYLOR: You think I ca n't lead a regula life ?
LYNN: You like the life you 've had , Jake . You like hangin ' out with the boys , livin ' in hotels , eatin ' dinner at midnight , having girls send you thei underwear in the mail . Remember the surprise party I threw for you when you made the All-Star team ? You neve showed up , but the doorbell rang once and we all got quiet and hid ehind the furniture . It was a guy to serve you with a paternity suit .
TAYLOR: That was a hoax . The girl was just trying to get some publicity .
LYNN: Yes , but you had obviously been with her . And it happened in front of all our friends .
TAYLOR: I was drownin ' , Lynn . The endorsements were dryin ' up , my knees were goin ' , they were talkin ' about sendin ' me down . I was just trying to hold on to somethin ' , prove to myself I was still an All-Star . I do n't care about that anymore . I know I do n't have much time left in baseball . I 'm just a guy trying to put his life back together . Thinkin ' about you was the only thing that kept me goin ' in Mexico . Lynn looks at him a long beat .
LYNN: I 've come back to you too many times , Jake . I ca n't afford to believe you anymore .
TAYLOR: I guess this is our last hurrah then .
LYNN: I guess so . Did you really read `` Moby Dick ? ''
TAYLOR: Cover to cover .
LYNN: October third .
TAYLOR: Your mom and dad like this guy ?
LYNN: You 're still their favorite . They 're unbuttoning each other 's shirts now .
TAYLOR: Gon na be a big wedding ?
LYNN: Tom does n't like big weddings . You coulda read Plot Outlines of 101 Great Novels .
TAYLOR: Where ?
LYNN: At any library .
TAYLOR: I mean the wedding .
LYNN: All Saints on Euclid .
TAYLOR: Nice church .
LYNN: Yeh . Who saved Ishmael at the end ?
TAYLOR: Nobody . It was Queequeg 's coffin . Am I invited ?
LYNN: Where ?
TAYLOR: To the wedding .
LYNN: If you want . Maybe you really did ead it . Their shirts are off now .
TAYLOR: Lynn ?
LYNN: What ?
TAYLOR: The zipper on your skirt is stuck .
LYNN: Use your imagination .
RACHEL: Well , my worst fears have been confirmed . We 're 60 and 60 , nine games out of first , and only two out of the first division . Who do those guys think they are ?
DONOVAN: Maybe you just have to accept the fact that they 're not as bad as you 'd hoped .
RACHEL: I do n't have to accept anything . Ou attendance is only beginning to rise . If we can force a losing streak fo a week or two , we can still turn this thing around . The fans are used to losers here . At the first sign of a slump they 'll give up on this team .
DONOVAN: What 's left to do ? You 've taken away everything you can .
RACHEL: Not everything .
TEMPLE: Memo says we 'll only be usin ' this for short trips .
BROWN: Good thing we do n't play anybody in Europe .
HAYES: Can I borrow one of those , man ? They do n't have any magazines on this us .
TAYLOR: Sure , go ahead . I think my reading days are over .
HAYES: Macbeth . This a good one ?
TAYLOR: These are all Hall of Famers . Hayes is impressed .
HAYES: I 'll trade you Song of Hiawatha fo The Deerslayer .
DORN: Naw , I 'm not into Song of Hiawatha .
HAYES: All right then , how about Crime and Punishment ?
DORN: Yeh , that sounds pretty good . That 's a detective story , right ?
HAYES: Yeh .
DRIVER: This is it . The Sheffield Arms .
BROWN: I do n't know if we can survive any more of these economy measures .
VOICE: Hey , jailbird !
TAYLOR: C'mon , Rick baby , settle down .
TAYLOR: What 's the problem , Rick ? You 're throwin ' basketballs up there . That guy in the dugout botherin ' you ?
VAUGHN: Naw , I 'm all right .
TAYLOR: Forget him . Worry about the guys carryin ' bats . C'mon , Ricky , let 's get nasty .
BROWN: I thought now that Vaughn had some control , he was ready for the Yankees .
PEPPER: Not quite yet .
DONOVAN: Mind if I join you ?
BROWN: Donovan . Hell no . What are you doin ' here ?
DONOVAN: Just wanted to get out on the road . You damn near pulled one out today .
BROWN: Someday we 'll figure out how to beat those guys .
DONOVAN: Ya know , you 've done a helluva jo this year .
BROWN: Sixty and sixty-one is hardly a helluva job .
DONOVAN: With this club it is .
BROWN: Ya know , when I first got to camp I figured this team had no chance . I was just hopin ' we 'd win enough that I could stay on and really start to uild something here . But there 's a lotta talent on this club , Charlie . The veterans are starting to play ack to form and the rookies are developing faster than I thought . There 's two or three potential all- stars in there . I think we 're a first division team right now .
DONOVAN: You really believe that , do n't you ?
BROWN: I know it . All we need is something to bring it all together .
DONOVAN: Rachel Phelps would never allow that .
BROWN: What do you mean ?
DONOVAN: She does n't want you in the first division . She does n't even want you in Cleveland . On Brown 's incredulous face , we
BROWN: I got somethin ' I think you oughta know about . I would n't have known about it myself if Charlie Donovan had n't told me , although I shoulda guessed it from everything that 's happened . It seems that Mrs. Phelps does n't think too highly of our worth .
DORN: Even me ?
BROWN: Even you , Dorn . Silence descends on the room .
HAYES: In other words , Phelps thinks we 're all dinks . That we do n't belong in the big leagues .
BROWN: That 's about it .
HARRIS: What if we do n't finish last ?
BROWN: She 'll replace you with somebody who will . After this season , you 'll all e sent back to the minors or given your outright release . So , all we 're gon na get is this one year .
TAYLOR: I do n't know about the rest of you , ut I 've been playin ' baseball since I was five years old . I 've had some good years and some years to forget . I 've burned out my knees I do n't think I have three fingers that work ight I 've lost most of the money I made and baseball has messed up my personal life from time to time . But I know one thing I can still play this game a little . And I 'd like to know who in this room thinks they 're the kinda bum Mrs. Phelps is lookin ' for ?
DORN: What 's that ?
TAYLOR: Win the whole fuckin ' thing .
FARMER: You remember bra burning in the '70 's , well , the newest thing in Cleveland is doormat burning as Indian fans are standing up and saying `` We wo n't e stepped on anymore '' .
TEAM: Hello , do you know us ?
TAYLOR: We 're a Major League baseball team , ut since we have n't won a pennant in thirty years , nobody recognizes us , not even in our own hometown .
VAUGHN: That 's why we carry the American Express card . No matter how far out of first we are , it keeps us from getting shut out at our favorite hotels and restaurants .
CERRANO: So if you 're looking for some big league clout , apply for the little green home run hitter .
TAYLOR: Look what it 's done for us . People still do n't recognize us , but we 're in the first division now .
VOICE: We interrupt this program to bring you the following special bulletin .
FARMER: Good evening , everybody . The incredible has happened . The Indians have finished the regular season in a first place tie with the New York Yankees on the strength of a 4-2 win over the Tigers in Detroit today . There will be a one-game playoff here in Cleveland the day afte tomorrow to decide the Eastern Division Championship , the Indians having won the coin flip held just moments ago in the American League office . We 'll have further details on the news at 11 , but for now , get your tomahawks ready , Cleveland .
HAYES: Hey , not bad for a has-been and a never-will-be .
TAYLOR: We have n't won anything yet . We still got one more to go . Dorn comes by Taylor 's locker .
DORN: Hey , Taylor , there 's a coupla drop- dead Annies outside . One of 'em says she used to know you pretty good . Brunette , great rack
TAYLOR: Darla .
DORN: Yeh . What doya say we chat 'em up ?
TAYLOR: I do n't know
DORN: C'mon , you 're not gon na keep moonin ' over that library chick , are you ? Forget her , she 's gone . We leave Taylor thinking it over .
CHARLES: The Indians are spending the night in Detroit and will bus back to Cleveland in the morning . We 're going to go back now to Ross Farmer who 's standing by at the Hotel Stanley where the Indians are staying in Detroit . Ross ? The scene shifts to
FARMER: Thank you , Hal . As you can see , the Indians are in high spirits tonight , looking forward to their showdown with the Yankees . Who will start that game is still a matter of some conjecture .
DARLA: You still got that black Corvette ? The one that the sound system took up the whole trunk ?
TAYLOR: No , I had to sell it .
DARLA: I thought they gave them to ya .
TAYLOR: Not after your knees go bad .
DARLA: That 's all right , you 'll be gettin ' a new one now .
TAYLOR: Darla , I do n't think I can do this .
DARLA: What do you mean ? We did this between innings once .
TAYLOR: I guess I 'm just not that guy anymore . Darla looks at him a long beat .
DARLA: Happens to the best of them soone or later . What 's her name ?
LYNN: Excuse me . I was in town for a conference and thought I 'd drop by , ut I can see you 're busy
TAYLOR: Lynn , wait
VAUGHN: You wanted to see me ?
BROWN: Yeh , Rick . I just wanted to tell you that I 'm startin ' Harris tomorrow against the Yankees , even though it 's your turn in the rotation .
VAUGHN: Yeh , sure . Whatever 's best for the team .
BROWN: Do n't read anything into it , Rick . You 're one of the guys that got us here .
VAUGHN: Yeh , okay .
VOICE: You mind if I join you ?
VAUGHN: I do n't think I 'd be very good company tonight .
SUZANNE: Why not ?
VAUGHN: Nothin ' . Job problem .
SUZANNE: I know , but that 's not why I came over . I do n't chase ball players .
VAUGHN: Why did you come over then ?
SUZANNE: Because you 're the sexiest man I 've ever laid eyes on , and you look like you could use a friend . We GO TO Vaughn . Forget it . He 's a goner .
VAUGHN: Where you goin ' ?
SUZANNE: I 've got ta get home .
VAUGHN: I did n't even get your name .
SUZANNE: Suzanne . Suzanne Dorn
VAUGHN: Suzanne Dorn ?
SUZANNE: Mrs. Suzanne Dorn . So long . You 're a great kid .
TAYLOR: Hello , Suzanne .
VAUGHN: I swear to God I did n't know who she was .
TAYLOR: You look beautiful .
LYNN: Thank you . I did n't think you 'd come .
TAYLOR: I ca n't stay . We got ta get to the park .
LYNN: Good luck today , Jake .
TAYLOR: Yeh , you too . Tell me one thing . The night you came up to my hotel was there eally a library conference ?
LYNN: No , I came to see you .
TAYLOR: Too bad it did n't work out better . I just wan na say I 'm sorry for all the things I 've put you through over the years .
LYNN: Even for last night ?
TAYLOR: Ca n't be sorry for that . Nothing happened .
LYNN: Then you were n't defending my hono again ?
TAYLOR: I did n't have to . She knew she was outclassed .
RACHEL: Come in .
BROWN: I wanted to hand in my resignation efore you had a chance to fire me .
RACHEL: What do you mean ?
BROWN: I know what you been tryin ' to do with this team . After the season , I want no part of it .
RACHEL: Well , I knew I could count on Charlie to tell somebody . I was just afraid he might take too long .
BROWN: Why would you want him to tell somebody ?
RACHEL: So you 'd tell the team , hopefully getting them mad enough to knock themselves out trying to prove they elonged in this league . I think it worked .
BROWN: You tryin ' to make me believe you wanted us to win all along ? Rachel nods .
RACHEL: We were broke . We could n't afford anything better . Donald left the team nearly bankrupt . If we 'd had another losing season , I would have had to sell the team . I knew we could n't win with the team we had , so I decided to bring in new players and see how they 'd do with the prope motivation . There was never any offe from Miami . I made it all up .
BROWN: Why should I believe any of this ? Now that we 're winnin ' it 's easy fo you to jump on the bandwagon .
RACHEL: If I 'd really wanted you to lose , all I had to do was send the best players back to the minors . But I did n't , did I ?
TAYLOR: I do n't know what Dorn 's wife is up to , but I think it 'd be best if you dressed early and got out to the ullpen before Dorn comes in . Vaughn nods .
HAYES: We got a problem . Cerrano wants some extra power for tonight . He 's lookin ' to sacrifice a live chicken . We ca n't have people pukin ' in the locke oom before the game .
TAYLOR: Tell him not to worry , I 'll take care of it .
DORN: Bye bye , honey , wish me luck .
SUZANNE: Before you go , there 's something I wanta tell you . Uh oh , we know what this is all about .
COLORMAN: Here 's your bourbon .
DOYLE: Wo n't need it tonight .
DORN: You know where Vaughn is ?
TAYLOR: Nope . Have n't seen him .
DORN: Let me know if you do . I wan na have a little talk with him . Dorn moves off .
CERRANO: Where 's my chicken ?
TAYLOR: It 's comin ' in now .
CERRANO: But it no alive .
TAYLOR: Believe me , Jo-Buu will like this . He 's got ta be gettin ' tired of raw chicken .
DOYLE: Hello , everybody , Harry Doyle bidding you a Wahoo welcome from beautiful Municipal Stadium , where tonight efore a capacity crowd of 75,000 screaming featherheads , the braves of the Cuyahoga will leave thei teepees in search of Cleveland 's first League Championship in over 30 years . Standing in the way , thei long time nemesis , the New York Yankees , the Big Boys of Broadway , who have beaten the Indians like a tom-tom all year long .
BROWN: All right , guys , let 's take it to 'em .
RACHEL: Shit . Donovan is a little confused by this .
BROWN: Damn , havin ' trouble with the curve all again .
HAYES: We should 've gotten him a live chicken .
CERRANO: I pissed off now , Jo-Buu . I good to you , I stand up for you . If you no help me now , I say fuck you , Jo-Buu . I do it myself .
DOYLE: Long drive , deep centerfield . Way ack . It might be . It could be . The all is Downtown , welcome to the Happy Hunting Ground . The game is tied .
BROWN: You pitched a hell of a game , Steve . Take a seat and we 'll see if we can get this guy for ya .
TAYLOR: You want Vaughn ?
BROWN: I know he has n't done real well against this guy , but I got a hunch he 's due .
BROWN: Okay , Ricky , Haywood likes the hard stuff in . Curve him on the hands , ust him away , and do n't get up with anything . You listenin ' to me Rick ?
TAYLOR: C'mon Ricky , this guy is the out you een waitin ' your whole life for .
DOYLE: O.K . Vaughn has finished his warmup and we 're ready to
TAYLOR: Oh , shit .
DORN: Let 's cut through the crap . I only got one thing to say to you . Just ear back and strike this motherfucke out .
TAYLOR: All right , Ricky , let 's get nasty .
BROWN: Forget the curveball . Go with the heater .
TAYLOR: Well , shit , all these pitches to choose from . Maybe we 'll try somethin ' different this time .
DOYLE: Can you believe this , Monty ?
DOYLE: Duke leads the league in saves , strikeouts per inning and nose hairs .
BROWN: Ya know I 'd be an ass not to pinch- hit for you here . You 're 0 for 18 against Duke . Plus you 're beat to shit you can hardly walk , there 's no way you can get around on this guy 's fast ball . So I want the absolute truth here . Can you beat this guy ?
TAYLOR: Yeh .
BROWN: Okay .
PEPPER: What 's he doing ?
BROWN: Flashing some signals . That 's a hell of an idea .
DOYLE: Safe . The Indians win it . The Indians win . Oh my God , the Indians win it ! !

BILL: Dammit , Brad , stop acting like a gang member . You 're from Malibu , you live in a nice home
BESS: With nice maids !
DR. FELDMAN: Bill , Bess , go to your happy places . Bill sits back , frustrated .
BRAD: To be the biggest rapper dere eve was ! See , I got something to say , and I need the world to hear it . I 'm the shiznit . I 'll buy y'all cars !
DR. FELDMAN: I see . And when did you first start feeling like you were this shiznit ?
BRAD: Oh , damn way back in the day . I 've had these beats in my head since I was a little shortie
GLADYS: Gluckman residence .
DR. FELDMAN: What I 'm sensing , Brad , is that your parents were n't really there for you .
BRAD: Nope .
BESS: That 's ridiculous !
BILL: What about your bar mitzvah ?
BRAD: It 's O.P.P. , bitch !
DR. FELDMAN: Bess , I 'm sensing you 'd like to share .
BESS: B-Rad , you 're a wonderful son it 's just that , well
BILL: Oh stop beating around the bush , Bess . What we 're trying to say is , Brad , that your behavior is , well , it 's an embarrassment to the family .
BRAD: Yo , Pops , that hurts my feelings .
BILL: I 'm sorry , but it 's the truth .
BRAD: Do n't be hatin ' .
BILL: And , Brad I ca n't have you on the campaign any longer .
BRAD: What ? ! Oh that 's how it is ? A'ight then . I 'm Audi ! I need to take a drive .
BESS: What can we do , doctor ?
DR. FELDMAN: Well , his lack of parental guidance left Brad wide open to outside influence , allowing hip- hop culture to firmly imprint on his psyche .
BILL: Do you think we can bring him ack ?
DR. FELDMAN: I do n't know . This is the most advanced case of gangsta-phrenia I 've ever seen .
BESS: Oh no , not gangsta-phrenia !
BRAD: What 's up ?
BESS: After our therapy session I ealized that your father and I could have been better parents . We neglected you and I feel terrible .
BRAD: For real ?
BESS: Yes . So from here on out I 'm going to be a better mother . I want to get closer to you be there for you . If ever you need
BRAD: Gladys ?
GLADYS: Yeah ?
BRAD: Ever feel like you do n't belong ?
GLADYS: All the time , baby . Most folks only feel comfortable around folks who are the same as them . When they meet someone different , they get scared and angry , wan na keep 'em down .
BRAD: What do you do about it ?
GLADYS: Nothin ' to do but keep it real . Be proud of who you are .
BRAD: Yeah , you right Gladys , when they gon na leave our people alone ?
GLADYS: I do n't know , baby , I just do n't know Eat your greens before they get cold , boy .
BRAD: Oh no , not again ! He gets up and runs out of the room .
TOM: How 'd it go with Feldman ?
BILL: Great news . If he sees Brad five days a week , he says we 'll see improvement in three to fou years .
JEN: But the election 's in two months .
BILL: Right , good point .
TOM: We 've been brainstorming on some different approaches , and I think we may have something solid here .
BILL: I 'm all ears .
TOM: Guys ? The team gathers around it 's a gang pitch .
BRETT: Brad might act 'ghetto , ' but let 's face it , he 's never been east of Beverly Hills .
JEN: But what if we give him a little dose of reality ?
GARY: Let him get a firsthand look at the ghetto .
BILL: You mean , have Brad actually go there ?
TOM: Exactly .
BILL: Sounds dangerous
BRETT: It 'll be perfectly safe .
BILL: How does it work ?
JEN: We hire actors to play gangsters .
TOM: They car-jack Brad , then take him on a 'tour ' of the 'hood give him a little taste of what thug life 's really like . It might just scare the black out of him .
TOM: Look , I 'm as down as the next other , guy fellah . I grew up in Compton , okay ? But let 's get over the P.C . thing and face facts . Unless we do something soon , Brad 's gon na cost us this election . The team all nods .
BILL: I do n't know it sounds so drastic .
TOM: Maybe drastic is what Brad needs , Bill . He is twenty-four . I mean , what 's he gon na do for a living , ap ? They all chuckle . Bill sighs .
BILL: Who do we get for the gangsters ?
TOM: Remember the anti-crime spot we shot last month ?
GARY: We 've got it cued up . They turn to the TV and Gary hits PLAY .
TOM: Those are our guys , right there .
BILL: Will he be safe ?
TOM: Absolutely .
BILL: I do n't know ca n't we just
BRAD: Lem me go .
MOCHA: You do n't want to see him like dis .
BRAD: What happened ?
MOCHA: He O.D . 'd again .
BRAD: Why did n't you stop him ?
MONSTER: I tried , yo !
BRAD: How many did he do ?
MOCHA: Like twelve , thirteen , I do n't know !
BRAD: Damn . Twelve Frapachizzo 's . Brotha 's caffeined out . Move aside .
HADJI: I'ma get mine ! Step , fool ! I 'll cut you , I swear !
BRAD: Just chill , Hadji , we 're here to help . What 's up ?
HADJI: I I I was pickin ' up aromatherapy candles at Illuminations for Moms , right ? And the counter trick gave me lemon when I specifically axed fo lilac ! Brad turns to Hadji .
BRAD: It 's on now !
BRAD: Yo , fool ! We got some hard-core drama 'bout to go down right neow ! !
HADJI: Dat 's right !
BRAD: Dis is our mall . Always was and always will be !
MOCHA: Woof woof !
OLD WOMAN: Oh , Mr. Amiraslani . I 'm so glad you came back . Our clerk accidentally gave you the wrong aromatherapy candles . Here you go . She hands Hadji a box marked `` Lilac . ''
BRAD: You better be validatin ' my parking ?
OLD WOMAN: Of course , sir .
BRAD: Dat 's what I 'm talkin ' 'bout . We get ours !
SEAN: Hold the phone , buddy you want us to scare this kid until he starts acting like a nice little white boy again ?
TOM: Do n't think you can handle it ?
SEAN: Of course I can handle it . I studied at Juilliard for God 's sake .
TOM: Fantastic . Tom hands them a manila envelope .
SEAN: Frickin ' A .
TOM: Okay , so here 's the story it 's your basic kidnapping
SEAN: So we hold him for ransom ?
TOM: Right . But when you see him acting ghetto and all , it pisses you off so much , you tour him around the 'hood to show him what things are really like . I had my guys brainstorm a few ideas
PJ: 'Mugging , drive-by shooting , crack deal gone bad '
SEAN: Why do n't you have him steal some watermelon while you 're at it ?
TOM: Pays fifteen grand apiece .
SEAN: Wait we 're kidnapping him , could n't we get arrested ?
TOM: Got you covered . Mr. Gluckman 's a illionaire if you run into any problems with the law , we 're very close with the commissioner . On the flip side , if you screw up and a single hair is touched on Bradley 's over-privileged head , I will make sure that you do serious time . Clear ?
SEAN: Cris tal .
TOM: Good .
PJ: What about the money ? Pulls out a smaller envelope .
TOM: Five up front , twenty-five when you return him to us , white .
SEAN: As the driven snow .
TOM: I 'll call you .
PJ: Congrats , my brother . We just ooked another gig .
SEAN: Yeah , but it 's totally dangerous , dude . You know what it 's like in the 'hood . We could get shot !
PJ: We can handle ourselves . Come on , man , it 's the ultimate acting challenge .
SEAN: You know what really chaps my ass ? After years of training and study , the only parts they 'll give us are gangbangers . Just once I 'd like to play a character who has decent grammar and does n't wea Timberlands .
PJ: Beats gettin ' dunked on by Bill Gluckman .
SEAN: Do we even know anybody down there ?
PJ: My cousin .
SEAN: Shondra .
SHONDRA: You zooted , nigga ?
WIDER: SEAN Honest to God .
SHONDRA: That 's the stupidest thing I eve heard . I got better things to do with my time , boy .
SEAN: Like work at Wienie In A Bun ?
PJ: Really . You 're the one always talkin ' about improvin ' yourself .
SHONDRA: I am improvin ' myself , fool . I oke up with no-good gang-bangin ' Tec , I 'm going to beauty school , then I'ma hook up my own salon
PJ: In the meantime , how about hooking a brother up with a Pepsi and some fries ?
SHONDRA: Shut up , stupid .
SEAN: Do this , Shondra . You 'll get some eal money so you can quit this minimum wage crap and start up your business .
SHONDRA: What you payin ' ?

SEAN: What the hell is that ?
PJ: Oh , my hair ? Shondra just did it . What ? You hate it ?
SEAN: No . I just think it 's a choice my character would have made .
PJ: Do n't go there , Sean . You 're just jealous you did n't think of it first .
SEAN: Whatever .
SEAN: What 's so funny ?
PJ: That wig , man ! I did n't know this was Halloween . Bring me back some candy ! He doubles over , falling on the floor .
SEAN: Whatever .
PJ: Nope , you 're not convincing me . Remember your core character . You 're an oppressed black man from the ghetto .
SEAN: Yeah , I know , I 'm having trouble finding this one . Lem me try it again . Gim me your ride , punk , o I will dust yo ass !

ADVISOR 1: I shall tell the king !
ADVISOR 2: I shall tell him !
DOCTOR: M'lady ? He kneels again to examine the Queen .
MUSKETEER: Away .
KEEPER: You dead yet ?
PORTHOS: Ah ha ! Here we are ! Aramis ! Porthos is here !
WENCH 1: So are you .
PORTHOS: Really ? I have n't been able to see it for fifteen years . Go on now , leave His Holiness alone . I 'll ing you back tomorrow when he 's in a better mood .
ARAMIS: Be quiet , you fat fool . Ca n't you see I 'm praying ?
PORTHOS: I just said you 're praying ! Are you deaf too ? I know you 're blind , ecause if you had seen the tits that just walked out of here , you 'd have tears in your eyes .
ARAMIS: There are more important things than tits .
PORTHOS: Really ? If you can name me one thing , one single thing , that is more sublime than the feel of a plump pink nipple between my lips , I will buy you a new cathedral .
ARAMIS: Forgiveness .
PORTHOS: Forgiveness ?
ARAMIS: Ca n't you see I 'm praying , goddammit ? !
PORTHOS: How are you , you skinny little pup ! Aramis sets the chair down in embarrassment .
ARAMIS: A simple theological discussion .
D'ARTAGNAN: Aramis the King wishes to see you .
ARAMIS: Still you serve him loyally though people hurl rotten eggs at his royal emblem .
D'ARTAGNAN: I see your mind is sharp as ever . The King said , `` Right away . '' Cut deep and hard , my friends .
PORTHOS: Deep and hard , D'Artagnan .
RAOUL: Do I look all right ?
ATHOS: None of the ladies will be able to take their eyes off you .
RAOUL: I care only about Michelle . Should I ask her when we first arrive ? Or or when we 're leaving ? I could ask her in the carriage but it is more romantic at the palace . I get so confused
ATHOS: Perhaps this will help .
RAOUL: Mother 's ring . I ca n't take this .
ATHOS: She died giving you to me . And I want to die knowing it is one the finger of the women my son loves .
PIERRE: Your Majesty , I know it is a a festive time , but before
KING LOUIS: The blue sash . No , the burgundy !
PIERRE: before the party begins
KING LOUIS: The party has already begun so why are you delaying me ?
PIERRE: We do not wish to delay you , Majesty , but as your advisors , we feel it is our our
CLAUDE: our duty .
PIERRE: Yes ! It is our duty to let you know there are riots in Paris .
LOUIS: Riots ? My people live in the world 's most beautiful city , thei king has the grandest palaces on earth . Why should they feel anything but pride and contentment ?
PIERRE: Well yes , of course , Majesty , and I 'm sure they are content except that well , they are starving .
LOUIS: Sometimes the poor do grow hungry . But why would they riot about it ?
PIERRE: Majesty We have more than enough food set aside for your birthday celebration next week . If we distributed some of that , we would have time to gather more before
LOUIS: Aramis ! I have been expecting you ! We are satisfied , that will do .
ARAMIS: Your birthday celebration , you Majesty ?
LOUIS: Next week . This is a mere garden party and I wish to join it , so I will be brief . I am experiencing esistance from the Jesuits .
ARAMIS: Well perhaps you should speak with them , your Majesty .
LOUIS: I have demanded it and common priests present themselves ! Can you imagine the arrogance ? Common Jesuit priests try to act as my equals , and they refuse to reveal the names of anyone else in thei order ! No one can keep secrets like the Jesuits can , and the identity of their leader is the darkest secret they hold . Even the Pope himself does not know who leads the Jesuit Order in France ! He suspects the Governor General of Jesuits , whoeve he is , is angling to become Pope himself .
ARAMIS: How can I serve you in this ?
LOUIS: Perhaps you can find out who this secret leader of the Jesuits is . You are now a priest , but you were once a Musketeer , serving the throne of France , a throne ordained of God . Can you accept this mission , and keep it private ?
ARAMIS: If I find out the identity of this Jesuit rebel . I will kill both him and the man who told me .
LOUIS: Once a Musketeer , always a Musketeer , eh ?
PIERRE: That food has spoiled . That is why it was not shipped to the army .
LOUIS: Exactly why it should be given away .
PIERRE: What an excellent idea , you Majesty !
MICHELLE: Is n't it glorious !
RAOUL: Michelle
LOUIS: Who is that ?
FRIEND 1: Raoul , son of Athos .
LOUIS: Not the soldier , you idiot !
FRIEND 2: Her name is Michelle . The king is transfixed .
LOUIS: What is it , d'Artagnan ? Assassins falling from the sky now ? The sycophants laugh loudly .
D'ARTAGNAN: The plans for use of the maze were not disclosed to me .
LOUIS: I decided it this morning .
D'ARTAGNAN: Then you must allow me to stay close to you so that
LOUIS: I am King , d'Artagnan . I will change my mind as I wish , and I will enjoy my banquet as I wish !
D'ARTAGNAN: But I deployed the Royal Guards according to your previous
LOUIS: Let us play a game , d'Artagnan , let us pretend I am King and you are Captain of my Musketeers . Let us ehave as if my wish is law . And my wish is to enjoy this party !
RAOUL: Michelle , I Ever since I returned I 've been wanting to speak with you about about
SERVANT: Monsieur , Mademoiselle ?
RAOUL: No ! Thank you Michelle , I
LOUIS: It pleases us to announce an entertainment for our guests ! A contest of agility and cunning !
MICHELLE: I have never seen a diamond so large !
LOUIS: Into the maze ! All of you ! Disperse , I command you !
RAOUL: The pendant will be yours ! With that he races after the pig .
LOUIS: Michelle , is n't it ? Speechless , she nods .
MICHELLE: Sire , I
LOUIS: You blush ! You do not wish to be eautiful to your King ?
ASSASSIN: Feed your people .
LOUIS: A pitiful madman , nothing more . Come , let us continue our chase ! Where is our unicorn ?
YOUNG MUSKETEER: Captain !
KEEPER: Food , moron .
ATTENDANT: She wishes a word with you .
D'ARTAGNAN: M'lady ?
ANNE: I understand you saved my son 's life today .
D'ARTAGNAN: God smiled upon us .
ANNE: And you were not hurt ?
D'ARTAGNAN: No , M'lady .
ANNE: That is good .
LIEUTENANT: Duty lists of the day , Captain !
D'ARTAGNAN: Thank you , Andre .
LIEUTENANT: Well , Captain
ATHOS: D'Artagnan !
D'ARTAGNAN: Athos , my friend !
ATHOS: Life is too long . Except when we have our friends . Look at you ! You 're still a boy ! Sit , sit ! I 'll open a bottle of wine .
D'ARTAGNAN: Thanks , but not for me .
ATHOS: You ca n't drink with a friend you have n't seen in months ?
D'ARTAGNAN: I have ordered a drill of the Royal Guard for midnight , and must be clear-headed for it .
ATHOS: Midnight ! Mon dieu ! Driving the youngsters hard , eh ?
D'ARTAGNAN: They must stay sharp . There was an attempt on the King 's life today .
ATHOS: Another ? How many times have you saved his life in this year alone ? Three ? Four ?
D'ARTAGNAN: I heard your playing .
ATHOS: I was feeling sorry for myself . Raoul is getting married , he proposed today ! I love that boy eyond all measure , I 've spent everything I own to give him education and opportunity . Now he has complete happiness , and I mope .
D'ARTAGNAN: Athos
ATHOS: That must be Raoul ! Raoul ! Look , d'Artagnan 's come to visit ! What 's wrong ? You look awful !
RAOUL: Michelle , she The king has invited her to come live in the palace .
ATHOS: But are you sure ?
RAOUL: We were at her door . I was just taking the ring from my pocket , fo the third time today , when a young Musketeer brought the invitation fo her to become a lady-in-waiting fo the Queen Mother .
ATHOS: Michelle can not possibly accept !
RAOUL: She can not possibly refuse . He family is poor , they have even less money than we do . And along with the invitation , the King sent the diamond pendant , from the piglet .
ATHOS: Piglet ? What are you ?
RAOUL: Never mind , Papa , it does n't matte now . She loved me once . I want to die remembering that .
ATHOS: Die ? What ?
RAOUL: I have rejoined the army , and asked to resume my commission at the head of the troops of General Fromberge .
ATHOS: Fromberge ? ! At the front ? ! No .
RAOUL: It is already done . I have just stopped at Mother 's grave , to say goodbye , before coming to tell you .
ATHOS: Raoul , no You can not do this . No matter how your heart is broken But Raoul stops him , with an embrace .
RAOUL: Goodbye , father . I am sorry .
ATHOS: Raoul
D'ARTAGNAN: If the young woman truly loves Raoul
ATHOS: She 's a woman , d'Artagnan ! From a poor family . You may still be young enough to believe love conquers everything , but I am old and hard and I 've seen too much . Even when kings are hunchbacks they have any woman they desire , because powe seduces even more than love !
D'ARTAGNAN: I fear I know our King . I came to try to bring you hope .
ATHOS: What hope is there ? A wartime commission can not be vacated except y the king , and what chance is there of that ? Fromberge is on the attle line , and Raoul
D'ARTAGNAN: I have dispatches a message to Fromberge requesting that Raoul be kept far from the fighting .
ATHOS: Raoul is everything to me .
D'ARTAGNAN: I know .
ATHOS: Oh my friend .
D'ARTAGNAN: I will also speak with the King , fo he is surely unaware of the problems his invitation to Mademoiselle Beaufort has caused .
ATHOS: You trust his character more than anyone else does .
D'ARTAGNAN: Raoul is hurrying to the front , so I must hurry too .
ATHOS: Save my son , d'Artagnan .
LIEUTENANT: Here is food , the gift of you loving King , on his birthday ! He gives to himself by giving to you , in that he loves you so much !
RUFFIAN: This stuff stinks . It is rotting ! The King gives us rotten food !
PANICKED SOLDIER: Back , toward the palace ! We can not hold them off ! We will fire a volley into them !
D'ARTAGNAN: No ! Run to the palace and close the gates . But do not fire !
RUFFIAN: Come on ! To the palace !
MOB: It 's d'Artagnan ! Le Generale de Musketeers !
RUFFIAN: One Musketeer ca n't stop us !
D'ARTAGNAN: Stop you ? You are Frenchmen , are you not ? I am one of you .
RUFFIAN: The King is a Frenchman , but he is not one of us !
D'ARTAGNAN: Citizens of Paris ! Give ear to me !
RUFFIAN: We 'll give you their ears !
D'ARTAGNAN: Wait and listen ! I beg you !
RIOTER: They give us garbage , not fit fo ats ! They think we are garbage !
D'ARTAGNAN: I 'm on my way to a salad ! Does n't anybody have any endive ?
RIOTERS: Three cheers for d'Artagnan ! Hurrah ! ! Hurrah ! !
CLAUDE: We already know about the riots !
D'ARTAGNAN: Does he know ?
PIERRE: We will tell him , when it is
CLAUDE: Convenient .
YOUNG WOMAN: Oh yes ! So good ! Ooo , wonderful , Marvelous ! Fan-tas
LOUIS: I 'm hungry .
YOUNG WOMAN: I will have food brought .
LOUIS: I like to eat alone .
D'ARTAGNAN: It is for your security that I have come , your Majesty for the security of your honor .
LOUIS: I already know about the riots , d'Artagnan , I heard them out there whispering . Some fool gave the order to distribute rotten food . I will deal with it tomorrow .
D'ARTAGNAN: Then there is one more thing , of an even more personal nature .
LOUIS: A personal nature ?
D'ARTAGNAN: Mademoiselle Michelle Beaufort . She is betrothed to Raoul , the son of Athos the Musketeer , who has served France through many tribulations .
LOUIS: Betrothed ? I think not .
D'ARTAGNAN: In his mind , anyway , and soon enough in hers . She had written him many letters of love . The King pokes at his food .
LOUIS: Miss Beaufort has accepted ou invitation . By this we can only suppose that she wishes to come as we wish her to be here .
D'ARTAGNAN: Your Majesty has had many women
LOUIS: That is my desire , and my desire is what should concern you , not the sentiments of some commoner !
D'ARTAGNAN: It is not Raoul 's heart alone that concerns me . It is yours . I know you find women compliant especially the poorer ones like Michelle . But do they love you ? Do you love them ? What about a queen to love ? A son of your own ?
LOUIS: What quaint notions , d'Artagnan ! But they contradict my father , who picked his queen when he was old , and only then to bear me .
D'ARTAGNAN: There is more to love than he knew , or that you know .
LOUIS: You dare criticize my father ? ! O lecture me ? !
D'ARTAGNAN: Not criticize plead . Love . Love your people , and you will not bea to see them hungry . Love women , and they will love you . Love yourself , and
LOUIS: That is enough ! You are a good servant , d'Artagnan , but you forget your place !
D'ARTAGNAN: At least help Raoul .
LOUIS: Silence ! I order you !
D'ARTAGNAN: Order Fromberge to keep him in safety ! It is the least you can do , to protect your own honor !
LOUIS: I will consider it . Now leave me .
D'ARTAGNAN: Thank you , your Majesty .
PIERRE: And I only say that the otten food was all my fault and I take full responsibility and beg the forgiveness of you all .
LOUIS: Well done , Pierre . It will be good for your soul , that you have taken esponsibility for your errors . And do n't worry , I will look after you family .
LOUIS: Do not rejoice but know that you King does not tolerate blunders that hurt his beloved people . More food is on its way , and my advisors tell me the new harvests are sure to be ountiful !
VOICE: Aramis .
ARAMIS: Your Majesty
LOUIS: How goes that favor I asked of you ?
ARAMIS: I grow closer to my target , you Majesty .
LOUIS: You bring me the heart of the Jesuit General , and you will have a palace of your own .
HANDMAIDEN: After your bath put on this , it is the King 's favorite color . That letter on the desk came here for you this morning .
MICHELLE: Raoul ! She opens the letter and reads quickly .
HANDMAIDEN: If you need me further , just ring .
MICHELLE: Sire ! I How did you
LOUIS: How did I get in ? You 're new here , and will soon learn many secrets . What is that ?
MICHELLE: Nothing .
LOUIS: A letter . May I see ?
MICHELLE: Raoul is in love
LOUIS: Enough of this , our dinner waits .
LOUIS: The food does n't please you ?
MICHELLE: It 's lovely . It 's just
LOUIS: This is more than you are used to . Your mother is a seamstress , you father is dead . You have three younger sisters , two of whom suffe from consumption . Do n't look so surprised , Kings know such things .
MICHELLE: I we are humble people
LOUIS: Wait , no ! Do not be ashamed . The straits of your family need not be permanent . It is a simple matter to have them brought to one of my country estates , where they may have fine meals , and physicians to look after them .
MICHELLE: You would do that , your Majesty ?
LOUIS: My dear , I 've already done it .
MICHELLE: Sire , I
LOUIS: If you do n't want to be so appealing , why did you touch the ose to your skin ? Where was it ? Here ?
JAILER: It 's a jolt at first , so brace yourself .
NEW KEEPER: Ugh ! He looks 'orrible .
JAILER: Moron .
STAFF OFFICER: Here .
RAOUL: Mi-cheeelllll ! !
LIEUTENANT: Sir a casualty report came
D'ARTAGNAN: No , no , no
ATHOS: Get out of my way .
D'ARTAGNAN: Athos , I beg you
ATHOS: To kill the king .
D'ARTAGNAN: Athos ! I know life means nothing to you at this moment , but I will not let you kill yourself .
ATHOS: The King killed my son !
D'ARTAGNAN: The cannons killed Raoul ! The cannons , and love . But not the King . A YOUNG MUSKETEER steps up .
YOUNG MUSKETEER: I 'll kill the old man for you , Captain , if you do n't wish to
ATHOS: Come on ! All of you !
D'ARTAGNAN: Get back , all of you !
LOUIS: What ? !
VOICE: Your Majesty it is Andre .
MICHELLE: Shall I leave ?
LOUIS: No , you may wait behind the screen .
LIEUTENANT: I would not have disturbed you , Majesty , but you ordered me to keep you informed
LOUIS: Yes , yes , go on .
LIEUTENANT: Athos , the former Musketeer , has just fought with several of you guard , at the Musketeers ' Gate .
LOUIS: Did they kill him ?
LIEUTENANT: No . He cut an ear from one of the men , no one else was hurt . Captain d'Artagnan allowed him to leave . Athos was upset about the death of his son , at the front .
LOUIS: Who was Athos seeking ? Tell me ! Did he try to enter the palace ?
LIEUTENANT: He did but Captain d'Artagnan locked his way .
LOUIS: You may go , Lieutenant . The Lieutenant moves back to the door .
LIEUTENANT: Do you want Athos arrested , you Majesty ?
LOUIS: Not by you . I will order d'Artagnan to do it .
MICHELLE: Did you know about Raoul ?
LOUIS: I did not want to upset you . It was tragic . I did everything I could for him . I ordered him positioned in a spot of complete safety , fa from the fighting . But he disregarded my wishes and charged into danger . He cuddles her as she weeps .
MICHELLE: Oh Louis , Louis She clings to him in her grief .
PORTHOS: Aramis is this the way to hell ?
ARAMIS: Hell may be our destination , dea Porthos , but not this trip .
PORTHOS: Where are we ?
ARAMIS: Jesus of Nazareth found the holy among the profane . If we are to have a place of private prayer , where better than here , beside the channels where the shit and the garbage run to the river ?
PORTHOS: Mother of God !
ARAMIS: It is also a place of burial .
PORTHOS: A tomb ? We 're in a tomb ?
ARAMIS: Catacombs . Very holy .
PORTHOS: Yaaaahhh !
ARAMIS: Relax , you big fool , it 's d'Artagnan .
D'ARTAGNAN: We have grown wiser with age . Now we know that some problems can not be settled with a sword .
ATHOS: And some problems can not be settled without one .
ARAMIS: Well here is the problem at hand the King has ordered me to discove the identity of the Governor General of Jesuits , and kill him . As ou English rivals have left the Catholic Church , Louis has struck on a plan to dominate the whole of Europe by uniting Church and State and making himself head of both . He has already picked the Pope . Only the Jesuits , who put God above throne or papacy , stand in his way .
PORTHOS: But does n't God ordain both Pope and King ?
ARAMIS: So they tell us . But what are we to elieve when the king is a tyrant , and the Church , meant to stand fo all those oppressed , has become the tool of oppression ? When no conscience is tolerated ? No dissent , no objection ?
PORTHOS: It is a weighty problem , Aramis ut perhaps you should leave it to this secret General of the Jesuits , whoever he might be .
ARAMIS: Easy to say , but hard to do . Fo what I am trying to tell you is that I am the Governor General of Jesuits in France . A stunned silence .
ATHOS: What do you propose to do ?
ARAMIS: Replace the king .
D'ARTAGNAN: I can not hear this !
PORTHOS: It ca n't be done .
ARAMIS: It can . I know the way .
ATHOS: I am with you !
D'ARTAGNAN: No ! Stop
ARAMIS: I will need you all . All for one . One for all .
D'ARTAGNAN: You You can not ask me to betray my king ! I have sworn to him !
ATHOS: It is honor you serve , and when the king is dishonorable you are removed from your oath of honor !
D'ARTAGNAN: An oath is an oath precisely because it can not be removed !
ATHOS: Why do you follow him , d'Artagnan ? ! I know you have put service above your own life , but why does this King deserve such loyalty ? He is a monster ! He executes ministers fo his own blunders , with thei families hostage so they take the lame ! He has no honor !
D'ARTAGNAN: No man is all bad or all good . I elieve I must believe that Louis can learn . And perhaps I can help him .
ATHOS: Whatever the plan I am in it ! The next time we meet , one of us will die . He storms out of the rear door of the chapel .
ARAMIS: Porthos , see to Athos , wo n't you ?
D'ARTAGNAN: The secret I carry I can not share . Not even with God . D'Artagnan moves to the door .
ARAMIS: I know . God go with you .
ATHOS: What are they doing ?
ARAMIS: Making the key to the throne .
PORTHOS: They are very large keys .
ATHOS: Porthos sleeps , and you plot . Do n't you think it 's time you told me what it is you are plotting ?
ARAMIS: Soon enough . Here we are .
ATHOS: The Prison of Belle Sur .
ARAMIS: Come , we have a boat waiting .
ATHOS: What is that ?
ARAMIS: A body .
ATHOS: I see that is a body ! But where did you get it ?
PORTHOS: He gets one day of confession each year . Today is the day .
ATHOS: Who does ?
PORTHOS: Best not to ask . Should n't even talk about it .
ATHOS: What do we do now ?
PORTHOS: I do n't know about you , but I plan to wait here .
HEAD GUARD: Who is this , then ?
GUARD: He says he 's the replacement . Aramis rattles off more Italian .
HEAD GUARD: Then let 's get it done . The head guard gestures to let them pass .
ARAMIS: I am a friend , here to help you .
GUARD: What now ?
HEAD GUARD: I never thought the bugger would last this long . But how could he just keel over and
GUARD: He says the prisoner has the fever , just like the little priest does .
HEAD GUARD: Plague ? They brought plague in here ? Get him out of here . Now ! Aramis rattles off a protest in Italian .
GUARD: No , no last rites ! Get away !
ATHOS: My God
ARAMIS: It 's all right . Take your time .
GUARD 1: You ever wonder who he was ?
GUARD 2: No Yes . But I never asked and you better not either .
ARAMIS: Jesuits .
ATHOS: Prison was horrible but it was his home . He 's been torn from it by strangers . He 's frightened , exhausted and the mask is familiar . Let him rest in it tonight , and remove it tomorrow .
ARAMIS: Excellent , Athos . You have a keen sense of this man .
ATHOS: His plight is obvious , is n't it ?
ARAMIS: And why are you so glum ?
PORTHOS: I expected action . There was no killing , no fighting , I was useless .
ATHOS: Are you hungry ?
PRISONER: I thought there is something about my face that men do not want to see . Something that makes them cruel . But then I realized they were cruel even when I was wearing the mask . I knew there must be some other reason , but I could not think what it was .
ATHOS: What is your name ?
D'ARTAGNAN: My friends Where have you gone ? He lowers the lantern , and leaves .
LOUIS: Take this to my mother .
NUN: M'lady are you ?
ANNE: Please , just go away .
ARAMIS: See ? There is plenty of food in the country . But the King keeps it going to the army instead of Athos marches in , all business .
ATHOS: He is sleeping . Now see here , Aramis , it 's time you told us
PORTHOS: I have no appetite for food , I am wasting away . Say goodbye to Porthos , for he is gone . Even women do n't interest me now .
ATHOS: Who is he , Aramis ?
ARAMIS: Tomorrow .
ATHOS: Tonight ! Right now ! We steal a man from a royal prison , we hide in a country chateau among an assortment of saints and sluts such as only you could provide , and still you wish to tell me nothing ? !
ARAMIS: You seek facts , when it would be etter to seek truth .
ATHOS: You are not my priest , Aramis ! You would not be , even if I had one .
ARAMIS: You are bitter , Athos . You are torn y grief , not only for Raoul , but for d'Artagnan , whom you love , and now treat as an enemy .
ATHOS: He who is not with us is against us .
ARAMIS: Those are the words of a broken spirit . My spirit is whole . I have trusted d'Artagnan with my deepest secrets , and I will never believe he is my enemy .
ATHOS: Then you are a fool a fool who has never lost a son . What gives you the right to judge me , to play God with the lives of others ? Is it ecause you are so much holier than everyone else ? !
ARAMIS: There is that , of course but mainly it is because I am so much smarter than everyone else .
PORTHOS: Kidney rocks . It hurts when I pee . It hurts when I shit . I 'm just a fat old fart with nothing to live for any more . I 'm going to hang myself , as soon as I 'm sober . They watch him shuffle toward the main house .
NUN: M'lady ? The eldest nun follows her .
ANNE: Oh God I Forgive me
D'ARTAGNAN: M'lady ?
ANNE: No , stay back ! Stay back !
D'ARTAGNAN: M'lady if anyone sees , it is death
ANNE: If I do n't kiss you , I die anyway .
D'ARTAGNAN: I ca n't bear to see you cry . What is wrong ?
ANNE: Nothing Nothing .
D'ARTAGNAN: Anne ! I know I know that to love you is treason against France . But not to love you is treason against my heart .
ANNE: Then we will both die traitors , d'Artagnan .
LOUIS: What is wrong ?
MICHELLE: Raoul Oh , Raoul
LOUIS: Listen , my darling Raoul was a a good friend . And now he is dead and that is very sad but
MICHELLE: We 'll burn in hell . Both of us . The King stands ; he 's had enough of this .
LOUIS: No , my love . You will burn in hell , for your sins . But I will not for I am King . My position is ordained by God .
LOUIS' VOICE: Help !
LOUIS: Out there ! Look ! Out there ! He The garden is empty .
D'ARTAGNAN: I just left the garden , it was empty . What did you see ?
LOUIS: It was nothing . A nightmare , nothing more . Go away , I
D'ARTAGNAN: Check the garden .
PORTHOS: Aramis ! Athos ! He looks exactly like exactly like
ARAMIS: I will answer all your questions . But first soap , water , and a razor .
PORTHOS: I remember that night . D'Artagnan was drunk , the only time I 've seen him that way . The three of us were eveling , remember , Athos ?
ARAMIS: But I was on duty
ARAMIS' VOICE: I was summoned to the royal apartments . Arrange a carriage , they told me , and wait by the doo of the stables .
ARAMIS: I have never forgotten that night , or what I carried .
PORTHOS: I do n't understand . What does this have to do with ? You carried a aby somewhere , it 's unusual , but
ARAMIS: Not just a baby , Porthos . I carried the child of the king .
PORTHOS: The child of the king is the king . Louis !
ARAMIS: No , not Louis !
PORTHOS: Athos , do you understand this ? He confuses me
ARAMIS: I carried the king 's child ! The queen had twins that night , and one of them was sent away , in secret !
PORTHOS: But why ?
ARAMIS: Because the old king had a twin as well , and through his whole reign his brother fought him for the throne . Then he had two heirs , not just sons but twins . So he decided that one be put away , as if he neve existed . You , Phillippe .
ARAMIS' VOICE: The old king ordered you be educated and well treated , but your identity kept from you and all those around you .
PHILLIPPE: Restored ?
ARAMIS: We will replace Louis with Phillippe . No one but the King himself and now we knows Phillippe even exists . All we have to do is switch them .
ATHOS: Switch ? ! That is your plan ? It is ludicrous !
ARAMIS: I have it all worked out .
ATHOS: Physical resemblance is but one small thing ! Louis has an arrogance , a manner
ARAMIS: Those can be adopted
ATHOS: And people close to him , who
ARAMIS: Do you think I have not considered that ? I have a plan and you may est assured that it is brilliant !
ATHOS: It is not just our lives you risk with this conceit of yours ! It is Phillippe 's as well !
ARAMIS: Yes , and he has a choice !
PHILLIPPE: I will try .
ARAMIS: You see ? A king .
ATHOS: Recent hours have been a shock .
PHILLIPPE: Perhaps not as much as you might imagine . When tutors answered every question except those about who I was . When I was imprisoned in a way no other man had ever been , I knew there was something different about me . But a king
ATHOS: Phillippe there is something I hope you understand . Terrible cruelty has been used against you . And you must understand that you did nothing to deserve it .
PHILLIPPE: There is wrath in me . I have learned to hide it . Those years in the cell , I dreamed that freedom would someday just happen , the way the mask happened . Now I am free . And with each free breath I feel the growing desire to make someone suffer for all I lost . Look at this , all this that for ten years I could not see ! What if I become a king a king no different from my other ?
ATHOS: The desire for vengeance can be a poison .
PHILLIPPE: What is its antidote ?
ATHOS: I suppose it is to remember there are many people who have never been in a prison , who pass such beauty every day , and never see it .
PHILLIPPE: You look so sad . Is it something I have done ?
ATHOS: It is something I have done o did not do .
PHILLIPPE: What is that ?
ATHOS: I did not share beauty with someone who is no longer here fo me to share beauty with .
ARAMIS: More wine !
ATHOS: Resting , he 's had a long day . Aramis
ARAMIS: More wine ! !
ATHOS: You must reconsider this plan . Phillippe is like a child , he
ARAMIS: You can do it .
ATHOS: In a year , maybe two , I could teach him enough to
ARAMIS: Three days .
ATHOS: Three days ? ? ! !
ARAMIS: The King is having a ball , a masquerade ball . It is the perfect opportunity and perhaps our only one . At any time Phillippe could be discovered , and what then ? Remembe France . Remember the poor . Remember Raoul . More wine ! ! Where are those serving girls ?
PORTHOS: It 's no use . My sword is bent .
SERVING WOMAN: It 'll be all right . You 're just taking a while to get started .
PORTHOS: No , it 's dead . I am useless . Porthos heaves himself out of bed .
ATHOS: Phillippe he 's very bright , he 's perceptive , but he is in such turmoil
ARAMIS: You grow fond of him . That 's good .
ATHOS: Do n't play God with me , Aramis I
ARAMIS: Go on .
ATHOS: But what is Porthos doing ?
ARAMIS: Going into the barn naked or so it appears .
ATHOS: But what is he doing ?
ARAMIS: About to hang himself , I should think .
ATHOS: Hang himself ? !
ARAMIS: He 's threatened to do it , it 's been uilding up in him for months .
ATHOS: We must stop him !
ARAMIS: Come now , Athos , if Porthos is determined to end his life , then he will certainly manage to find the opportunity .
ATHOS: But but
PORTHOS: A'dieu , cruel life ! Farewell to useless Porthos ! He steps off the stool .
ARAMIS: I sawed the main beam in half .
PORTHOS: Aramis ! ! You did this , did n't you ! You knew I would try hanging myself , and you sawed the beam ! Admit it ! Admit it , by God ! ! ADMIT IT ! ! !
ARAMIS: Well of course I knew it , Porthos . Porthos stands there , blinking .
PORTHOS: Well Well Okay .
WENCH: AAAAAAHHHHHHH !
ATHOS: Poor Phillippe !
ARAMIS: The mask is terrifying especially when unexpected . Do you notice ?
ATHOS: All I noticed was that Phillippe feels even more like an animal . Athos hurries in ; Aramis looks at Porthos .
ARAMIS: See , Porthos secrets are hard to keep . We do n't have much time .
PHILLIPPE: I 've worn this mask so long , I could n't sleep without it .
ATHOS: I will sit with you . I ca n't sleep either .
PHILLIPPE: Athos ? Thank you for being my guide back into the world .
ATHOS: Where are you going ? !
ARAMIS: Paris . There is still much to do . We 'll be back soon . Be ready .
ATHOS: But Aramis ! Phillippe can learn in time , but
ARAMIS: He can learn to be Phillippe in time . But first he must learn to be Louis , and for that he has two more days .
ATHOS: What you 're asking is impossible !
ARAMIS: I offer you the perfect revolution . A revolution without bloodshed , without any loss of life , even without treason , for he too is the son of the King .
ATHOS: But
ARAMIS: You said you 'd do anything , Athos , anything to replace this King . So do it .
ATHOS: No , wait , do not hold your goblet that way . With a king it is so .
PHILLIPPE: I am so sorry ! Forgive me , I
ATHOS: No ! Do not be sorry ! Never be sorry ! The King cares for nothing and for no one ! There are no mistakes when you are King ! What you do is right for every person ! A King has contempt for everyone !
PHILLIPPE: Is that the king of king you wish me to be ? Or do you say this because of your son ?
ATHOS: How did you know ?
PHILLIPPE: Porthos told me .
ATHOS: I am not I am not angry with you . You understand ? Good . Now , as to acting like a king , we wish you to e a good king . But at first at first you must pass as Louis , and Louis is cold and cruel . So you must stop looking at people with such softness . It is not Kingly . The eyes of a King say that all he cares about is himself , and you eyes how do I tell him this ? You eyes ask so much . You should n't care about me , about my about Athos ' voice breaks , his body sags .
ARAMIS: Coming ?
PORTHOS: What use am I ?
ARAMIS: We go someplace dangerous .
PORTHOS: Why did n't you say so ?
ROBBER: Your money or your life .
THIRD ROBBER: Make it quick , old man !
PORTHOS: Old ? Old ? ! You 're all trying to ob us because you think we 're old ?
ARAMIS: Come on
PORTHOS: I have to tell you something . I love Paris !
ARAMIS: Here we are . Aramis leads Porthos inside .
PORTHOS: Aramis These are these are whores !
ARAMIS: So was Mary Magdalene , and our Lord loved her .
PORTHOS: Did she have tits like that ? A greasy , disgusting PIMP shuffles over .
PIMP: What do you want ? White ? Black ? Both ?
ARAMIS: No . We want you , Father Belles . The pimp reacts with fury , drawing a pistol .
PIMP: Get out ! Now ! I will kill you where you stand !
ARAMIS: Bless me , Father , for I have sinned .
PIMP: Do n't ! Get out !
ARAMIS: I have sinned . And no othe priest 's assurance of forgiveness can mean as much as yours . Tell me that I can be forgiven , no matte what I have done .
PORTHOS: He 's going to kill you , Aramis .
ARAMIS: Then let him kill me , if all my faith is wrong .
PRIESTS: Father Belles !
MONK: You have made a miracle !
ARAMIS: God makes miracles . You make dinner .
JESUIT: The ball has been rescheduled fo tomorrow . As Aramis hears this in surprise
ATHOS: These rooms are yours . Up these stairs or through this hidden passage is the room of you mistress Michelle .
PHILLIPPE: Whose rooms are those ?
ATHOS: Your mother 's .
ARAMIS: Change the horses ! Clear out everything ! NOW ! !
ATHOS: Aramis , this will never
ARAMIS: Louis is planning a visit to the Vatican , then who knows where afte that . If we miss him now we may not get another chance .
ATHOS: But
ARAMIS: It presses us but it is good for us too ! Louis ' whims make him more vulnerable . We are less ready , but so are his guards !
PORTHOS: D'Artagnan , unready ?
ATHOS: At a ball , everyone watches the King !
ARAMIS: But what if something extraordinary happened ? Something so unusual that all the attention went to someone else ? Someone whose confirmation of Phillippe the King would never be questioned .
PORTHOS: Who ?
ARAMIS: The Queen Mother . Anne .
ANNE: Bless me Father , for I have sinned .
FATHER BELLES: So have I .
ANNE: Father Belles ? ! He taps a silencing finger to his lips .
FATHER BELLES: I was . I see you are still a woman of faith . I have come back to ask you if you believe that one lie can poison your whole life and one truth can put it back togethe again .
LOUIS: It shall be interesting tonight . D'Artagnan enters , looking concerned .
D'ARTAGNAN: Your Majesty . This ball , with an open invitation to the nobility of Paris we have no way of checking
LOUIS: You will protect me as you always have , d'Artagnan .
MICHELLE: Murderer ! Murderer ! She holds a letter , crushed in her hand .
LOUIS: Hysterical woman .
CLAUDE: Sire , misuse of the royal seal !
LOUIS: She 'll be gone tomorrow .
ANNE: May I speak with you ? Alone ?
LOUIS: I am preparing for a ball !
ANNE: We have n't visited in three years . And we should have privacy . Exasperated , Louis waves his attendants away .
LOUIS: What is it , mother ?
ANNE: I wish to discuss your brother .
LOUIS: He is dead ! By God 's choice ! There is nothing to discuss .
ANNE: First they told me he had died at irth . Then your father admitted he was alive , but well cared for , in secret . But the message that told of his death said he had been a prisoner .
LOUIS: I am King , Mother ! And I do not wish to discuss this with you .
ANNE: He was my blood and I demand to know what happened to him .
LOUIS: Why would you ask now ? You neve asked before !
ANNE: Because I have dreamed of him . Not as the baby they took away , but as a man .
LOUIS: You have prayed too much . Your mind is weak .
ANNE: I believe in dreams , Louis . They are our souls speaking to us , from that world beyond our eyes . And that son I never saw in daylight was standing in the moonlight of my dreams . And he wore an iron mask .
LOUIS: It it does n't matter , Mother ! He is dead now ! Dead !
ANNE: Yes . Dead . Two nights ago . The night of my dream .
LOUIS: If if he was wearing an iron mask in your dream , then how could you know he was your son ? Louis smiles ; he thinks he has her .
ANNE: Then you did do it , Louis . You did put your brother in an iron mask .
LOUIS: I have a ball to attend !
PHILLIPPE: Whose carriage is this ?
PORTHOS: It was mine . But since you are about to be the king , it is yours . The new carriage lurches away .
ARAMIS: Phillippe first .
ATHOS: Hold your goblet with two fingers .
PORTHOS: And make love as if you do n't care . The way Kings do . And fart wheneve you wish . Aramis tucks a note into Phillippe 's pocket .
ARAMIS: Remember , all you have to do is get through tonight . Smile and nod a lot , and if you get stuck just wave and announce , `` Continue . '' In the morning you hand this note to d'Artagnan , pardoning Athos and instructing that he , Aramis and Porthos be brought to the palace as your advisors . And all is well .
PORTHOS: D'Artagnan watches everything . We have to be lucky .
ARAMIS: We will make our own luck tonight if Phillippe holds up .
ATHOS: Stay calm , you 're doing fine .
PHILLIPPE: My brother
YOUNG BEAUTY: What is wrong , your majesty ?
LOUIS: Nothing , I continue .
YOUNG BEAUTY: See what , Majesty ?
D'ARTAGNAN: Your Majesty ?
LOUIS: tired . Must lie down .
D'ARTAGNAN: Carry on , everyone
ARAMIS: Quick , to the passages .
D'ARTAGNAN: Your Majesty , is there anything ? The King shuts the door in d'Artagnan 's face .
PHILLIPPE: The room of the King 's favorite mistress ?
ATHOS: She will be at the ball .
ARAMIS: It is Judgment Day .
MUSKETEERS: Your Majesty .
LOUIS: Wh Wha
ARAMIS: Do n't look so shocked , Phillippe . Come , you 're going back to prison .
LOUIS: Phillippe ? ! Why do you call me
ARAMIS: D'Artagnan guards the hallway ! You must go back the way we came !
ATHOS: Now , your Majesty . It is time .
PHILLIPPE: Continue .
MICHELLE: My gracious noble lord
PHILLIPPE: How are you Michelle ?
MICHELLE: How should I be ? I came to give this back to you .
CLAUDE: Fret not with this , your Majesty
PHILLIPPE: Stop ! You 're hurting her !
ATHOS: Do n't worry , your Majesty . We have a prison for you , where you can rest peacefully .
D'ARTAGNAN: Michelle
MICHELLE: In the ballroom . But he is n't the same man .
CLAUDE: To King Louis ! And to Anne , the Queen Mother !
GUESTS: To King Louis , and the Queen Mother !
ANNE: I retire now . Wait two waltzes , then retire to your room ; and spend the night in safety . We have much to talk about , and have the rest of our lives to do it .
PHILLIPPE: Good night , Mother .
ANNE: Good night my son .
D'ARTAGNAN: Anne ! You look Remembering himself , he bows deeply .
ANNE: D'Artagnan .
D'ARTAGNAN: I have never seen a sight more eautiful than you , tonight .
ANNE: We have much to discuss . Tomorrow .
D'ARTAGNAN: How long has the King been back ?
GUARD: Some while , Captain .
D'ARTAGNAN: He did n't pass my doorway , I was in my room .
GUARD: He must 've , Captain , there is no other way here .
D'ARTAGNAN: Sire , we have an emergency of security . I must ask you to accompany me .
PHILLIPPE: The ball Continue .
D'ARTAGNAN: I must insist , Sire .
PHILLIPPE: Yes ? Why do you bring me here , d'Artagnan ?
PORTHOS: The King ! Look ! It 's the King ! He means Phillippe .
D'ARTAGNAN: Then who is that lying beside you ?
PORTHOS: Wh ? Where did he come from ? Athos grabs d'Artagnan 's arm .
ATHOS: If you ever loved me if you eve loved honor , or anything else then stand now , and let it happen .
D'ARTAGNAN: I can not , Athos . Dearly as I love you , I can not .
ARAMIS: This man is an impostor . We caught him trying to impersonate the King , and were just getting rid of him . Louis struggles upright .
LOUIS: D'Artagnan , arrest them all !
ARAMIS: Shut up , knave !
D'ARTAGNAN: Before I came here , I insisted the King come with me . The real Louis would never have let me insist .
ARAMIS: Pull them back , d'Artagnan .
D'ARTAGNAN: You ca n't do it .
ARAMIS: Pull them back !
D'ARTAGNAN: Everyone back .
ARAMIS: Phillippe , get into the boat . Into the boat ! Now ! Phillippe obeys .
LOUIS: You will not shed royal blood !
D'ARTAGNAN: It shall be done , your Majesty .
LOUIS: Even the bedchamber passages ! Let none remain !
D'ARTAGNAN: Yes , your Majesty .
LOUIS: I was told this impostor was dead !
D'ARTAGNAN: You knew you had a double ?
LOUIS: He is my brother .
D'ARTAGNAN: I I thought he was but an impostor who resembled
LOUIS: My twin . Which has kept him alive . Until now .
ANNE'S VOICE: No ! !
ANNE: Louis , please !
LOUIS: My guards are useless ! Take he from me !
ANNE: He is your brother !
LOUIS: He is nothing now .
D'ARTAGNAN: Your Majesty This man before you He is royal blood , the same as you . To spill it is the one thing even you can not do . It is against the laws of God , and of France .
LOUIS: Get out of my way .
D'ARTAGNAN: Not once have I ever asked anything for myself . I ask now . Forgive this man , this prisoner you other .
LOUIS: Forgive ? !
D'ARTAGNAN: Aramis , Porthos and Athos too . I know what they have done was a threat against you and yet that threat has been removed , with no harm coming to your Majesty . If their passions were in error , thei spirits have ever been noble . Forgive them .
LOUIS: They have plotted against me ! Me ! The embodiment of God 's will !
D'ARTAGNAN: Your Majesty Every day of you life , I have watched over you . No angel could have stood a more faithful vigil . I have bled fo you , and have prayed , every day , to see you become greater than you office , better than the law . Show me now what my faith and blood have purchased . Show mercy .
LOUIS: You take the side of traitors ?
PHILLIPPE: Please , may I speak ? M'lord I eg that you kill me . I release you , before Almighty God , from any claim of sin in taking my life . In fact I will pray that God reward you for your mercy to do it . But do not I beg you return me to the prison , where I have lived so long .
LOUIS: D'Artagnan , you will hunt down Aramis , Porthos and Athos , and bring me their heads , or I will have yours . And as for you , Phillippe Back to the prison you shall go , and into the mask you hate .
ANNE: No , Louis ! No !
LOUIS: Wear it until you love it . And die in it ! !
LOUIS: Where is Michelle ?
D'ARTAGNAN: There .
ANNE: I could n't tell you . You had enough to carry .
D'ARTAGNAN: Anne The night we had together I always wanted more . But that one , it was enough . Enough to make me love you forever . I want you to emember that and go on . As strong as you are now . No matte what happens .
ANNE: D'Artagnan ?
PHILLIPPE: No . Please ! No !
BLACKSMITH: Pay me quick , I want out of here .
GUARDS: What
BASTILLE JAILER: You saw the prisoner 's face .
LOUIS: Now . Where is d'Artagnan ?
LIEUTENANT: Out directing the search for the traitors .
LOUIS: When he returns , watch him . When he leaves again , you tell me .
ARAMIS: Bloody hell
ATHOS: We ca n't stay here . That traito d'Artagnan knows about this place .
PORTHOS: Can we eat before we go ? This excitement 's given me an appetite .
ARAMIS: Bread and wine in that cupboard .
PORTHOS: A note . Pinned with a dagger , like the old days . He removes the note , and reads
ATHOS: He lures us to capture .
ARAMIS: He seeks redemption .
ATHOS: You 're a fool !
ARAMIS: Perhaps . But of d'Artagnan I am certain . What he did tonight was what he told us all along he would do be faithful to his King .
ATHOS: So what has changed ?
ARAMIS: Perhaps he serves a different king .
PORTHOS: What choice is there ? If Phillippe is in the Bastille , then to the Bastille we will go .
ATHOS: You are right . But it is a trap .
PORTHOS: So what ? I 'd rather die covered in lood , than an old man , lying in my own piss .
ARAMIS: Then to the Bastille .
ATHOS: To the Bastille . And death .
PORTHOS: Open up ! We have a prisoner !
GUARD: Take him down to level three . The Captain will see to the documents .
PORTHOS: It worked !
ATHOS: It 's a prison , you idiot ! They do n't expect anyone to try getting in ! The problem will come when we want out !
ARAMIS: Midnight ! We have ten minutes ! They press on , deeper into the Bastille .
JAILER: Hey !
ATHOS: Phillippe ?
PHILLIPPE: How did you
ARAMIS: Someone 's coming !
PORTHOS: D'Artagnan !
D'ARTAGNAN: The way is blocked above . The Captain of the Bastille has turned ack from the mission I sent him on , and is in the courtyard with a party of men .
ATHOS: He lies . He is here to trap us .
D'ARTAGNAN: I came to see you safely out . Check for yourself .
PORTHOS: D'Artagnan is right , the courtyard is filling with soldiers !
D'ARTAGNAN: This way .
ARAMIS: They will know you helped us , if we go this way .
D'ARTAGNAN: That does n't matter now .
LOUIS: There ! Stop them !
ATHOS: Betrayed !
ARAMIS: Back the way we came !
ATHOS: Trapped .
LOUIS: Charge them !
LIEUTENANT: The corridor nullifies our number And no one has stomach to fight the Captain .
LOUIS: D'Artagnan !
LOUIS' VOICE: I am not angry with you . I knew you would lead me to them , and so you have ! Lay down your sword , and I will not punish you ! I will let you etire in peace to live out you days in the countryside ! And I will give your friends a swift execution , if you surrender now .
ARAMIS: D'Artagnan . Perhaps you should accept his offer , for we are dead anyway .
PORTHOS: He is right , d'Artagnan .
PHILLIPPE: Wait . Bargain me to Louis , for all your lives . You have done you est . Let me go , and let all of you find peace .
D'ARTAGNAN: No . Even if I could give up my friends , I could never give up my son .
ARAMIS: D'Artagnan Those are young Musketeers down there . They have een weaned on our legends . They evere us it is an advantage . Why do n't we charge them ?
D'ARTAGNAN: I trained those men myself . They will stand and fight . But if we are to die , let it be this way .
ATHOS: One for all . All for one .
PHILLIPPE: If I could have a blade , then I would be please to run with you .
LIEUTENANT: Magnificent valor
LOUIS: Shoot them ! Shoot them !
LIEUTENANT: Draw blades !
D'ARTAGNAN: NO !
PHILLIPPE: I am unhurt
D'ARTAGNAN: Phillippe ! No Do n't He is your brother !
LIEUTENANT: Brother ?
PHILLIPPE: All this time I was a lost secret . But you were hiding all your loyalty , all your love . You were the Man in the Iron Mask .
ATHOS: D'Artagnan
D'ARTAGNAN: Shhh . All my life , this is the death I have wanted . To die among you . One for all and all for He is gone .
LIEUTENANT: All my life , all I ever wanted to e was him .
KING: You will put this madman where no one can hear his insanity . Let him e fed by a deaf mute . But feed him well , and let him have a long life within the Iron Mask .
BASTILLE GOVERNOR: And them ? He means Aramis , Porthos , and Athos .
KING: They are my loyal servants .
ARAMIS: Amen .
ATHOS: He was the best of us all .
PHILLIPPE: I will be with you in a moment , Mother .
CREASY'S VOICE: Ezekiel 25 17 Blessed is he who in the name of charity and good will shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness for he is truly his brother 's keeper and the finder of lost children .
JORDAN: The family paid the ransom and he was eturned two days later . His father still has n't gotten up the nerve to ask him if they fucked him up the ass .
SAMUEL: And now every mother with money in Mexico City wants bigger and better bodyguards . My own wife included .
JORDAN: If she pisses you off , you get another one .
SAMUEL: Do you know what she told me last night ?
LISA: A man 's worth can be judged by what he has or what he owes . Only the amount matters .
SAMUEL: And bankruptcy . Where will that put me in the social strata ?
LISA: I 'm only asking for one thing . And it 's not an extravagance . It 's not even fo me ; it 's for our daughter .
SAMUEL: Our daughter .
LISA: Our child 's safety is at stake .
SAMUEL: These people are professionals . They do n't waste their time taking children whose fathers are virtually bankrupt .
LISA: Samuel , it is not something we should skimp on . A bodyguard 's presence in the car or outside the school was at least some form of deterrent . Now he 's gone , I feel totally exposed . She just stares at him . He melts .
SAMUEL: Of course I care about Pinta . She 'll be as beautiful as her mother one day .
JORDAN: Yeah ? And if she was ugly ?
SAMUEL: I have a policy , AIG . It covers me and my family and when it runs out in sixty days , without a bodyguard , I will not be able to renew it .
JORDAN: I know you need to please Lisa . An ass like that is hard to find . Good odyguards are even harder .
SAMUEL: I know ! I just had to let one go because I could n't afford him ! Jordan lights his cigar .
JORDAN: You need a bodyguard of some description . It 's a dangerous world we live in . But you will get what you pay for . He does n't need to be Superman , does he ? Can you go fifteen grand ?
SAMUEL: For a year ?
JORDAN: For a few months . Hire someone cheap . You have to have a bodyguard to keep the insurance . Then fire him fo incompetence . The important thing is Lisa 's daughter will return to school . Samuel finally follows the logic .
SAMUEL: And Lisa will be able to save face . We wo n't be the only family without a odyguard .
JORDAN: Her beauty fucks with your mind .
SAMUEL: For an American she understands this country very well .
JORDAN: She understands men . As Samuel puffs his cigar in satisfaction
CUSTOMS: Where are you coming from ?
CREASY: South America .
CUSTOMS: Where are you staying in Mexico ?
CREASY: I 'm on to Juarez .
CUSTOMS: Why ?
CREASY: I have a friend there .
CUSTOMS: I can not see your eyes , Senor .
CREASY: It 's a permit to carry a gun in Columbia . The gun you 're about to find in that suitcase . Polaroid FLASH
RAYBURN: Rayburn here .
CREASY: When did Mexican Customs start getting smart ? RAYBURN 's SUV
RAYBURN: Creasy ? ? ? Where the fuck are you ?
CREASY: I 'm here . RAYBURN 's SUV
RAYBURN: What do you mean , I 'm here ?
CREASY: I 'm in a Customs holding tank in Mexico City International . Bring a bunch of cash about 5K . I 'm going to need it .
RAYBURN: This is going to cost you big time . INT . STRIP BAR - Rethink Location
CREASY: Listen it was a calculated risk . I 've done it a million times and never got caught .
RAYBURN: Everything happens once if you live long enough .
CREASY: It does n't make sense to x-ray your bags coming off the plane .
RAYBURN: This is Mexico , they do everything ackwards . Creasy hits the 'Jack ' .
CREASY: Nothing wrong .
RAYBURN: Do n't give me that bullshit . Creasy changes subject .
CREASY: So how 's business ?
RAYBURN: Japanese are here in a big way . Cheap labor . Factory space . But they feel a lot safer living over the border in El Paso . I ferry 'em back and forth . They think I 'm John-fucking-Wayne .
CREASY: But do n't you stay in El Paso ?
RAYBURN: Fuck , I love Mexico . I live like a king down here . Creasy takes a look around the Seedy Bar .
CREASY: Yeah , right
RAYBURN: Oh , like you have n't been in worse places .
CREASY: And a level five shithole is better than a level six . Your logic 's inescapable .
RAYBURN: You been working ?
CREASY: Not for eight months . I was in Columbia looking around , but , nothing seemed interesting .
RAYBURN: How long you staying , Crease ?
CREASY: Got no plans , Rayburn , Nothing on . Just wanted to see you , how you were . Came by on impulse .
RAYBURN: You did something on impulse ?
CREASY: Everything happens once if you live long enough . Creasy smiles .
LISA: You should be sleeping , baby .
RAYBURN: That 's right , a bodyguard . Creasy looks at him blankly .
CREASY: You 're crazy . People would hire a has- een , Ray ? A drunk ?
RAYBURN: Well , you 'd have to keep it unde control .
CREASY: And what if , just say , there was a kidnap attempt ?
RAYBURN: You do your best . They wo n't be paying you enough to perform miracles . Creasy just shakes his head .
CREASY: A bodyguard has to be close to someone all the time . Willing to talk . I 'm not good at that .
RAYBURN: So you 'll be the silent type . People will appreciate that . Creasy shakes his head , looks out the window .
CREASY: I came to visit you .
RAYBURN: Bullshit . I 've known you fifteen years . You do n't visit .
CREASY: A bodyguard Who 's the guy ?
RAYBURN: Samuel Ramos . Owns one of the plants in Juarez . The Jap car industry is in the toilet . He 's trying to persuade Ford to partner with him . I think he 's in trouble . He asked me if I knew anyone he could trust .
CREASY: Oh , now you think I can be trusted .
RAYBURN: Take a job , Creasy . Breathe some air . Then decide if you want to stick around or not .
SAMUEL: You drive easily . Smoothly . Creasy does n't answer , just drives .
CREASY: Yes .
SAMUEL: Show me , please .
CREASY: Nine millimeter . A Sig Sauer 226 .
SAMUEL: Have you used this type before ?
CREASY: It 's loaded . Samuel hands back the gun .
SAMUEL: You will meet my wife first . She would like it if you are presentable , polite and respectful . You 'll be the fifth candidate she 's seen this week . Samuel flips through a manila folder .
CREASY: I drink .
SAMUEL: How does it affect you ?
CREASY: My coordination . Reaction time . If top professionals try to kidnap you daughter , the service will be on par with the pay .
SAMUEL: And what if amateurs try it ?
CREASY: I 'll probably kill them . Is that likely ?
SAMUEL: No . And no one is to know of you drinking problem . That includes my wife .
LISA: The world of our children . How dare they ?
CREASY: It 's war . The weakest suffer the most .
LISA: You 're American .
CREASY: So are you .
SAMUEL: My wife , Mr. Creasy .
LISA: Lisa Martin Ramos , Mr. Creasy .
CREASY: Thank you . Scotch and a little water . She steps to the bar to make it .
LISA: You 've done much of this work before ?
CREASY: Never . Samuel sells , covers for Creasy 's reticence .
SAMUEL: He has experience in related work . A great deal of it .
LISA: Do you have any family , Mr. Creasy ? Creasy hesitates for an imperceptible beat .
CREASY: No . I do not have family .
CREASY: Thank you .
LISA: Pinta !
SAMUEL: I think it 's fantastic .
LISA: You realize that you 've brought a kille into the house .
CREASY: If they like me .
CREASY: Who 's Emilio ?
LISA: School tomorrow , baby . Pinta smiles , happy at the thought .
LISA: She likes him .
SAMUEL: Hmm ?
LISA: Creasy . Pinta likes him .
SAMUEL: Pinta loves school . She 'd like Count Dracula is he took her back there .
CREASY: The United States .
SISTER ANNA: Mr. Creasy .
CREASY: Yeah , I 've got to get used to the routes . I It wo n't happen again .
SISTER ANNA: No offense , but I 'm sorry that you profession needs to exist .
CREASY: So am I , Sister .
SISTER ANNA: Do you ever see the hand of God in what you do ?
CREASY: Not for a long time , sister .
SISTER ANNA: The bible says , `` Be not overcome of evil , ut overcome evil with good . ''
CREASY: Romans , chapter 12 , verse 21 .
RAYBURN: Rayburn here . Creasy , what 's up ? Yeah ?
CREASY: There 's still ink on my fingers from last week .
RAYBURN: You got tossed . Do n't trust the cops , especially the Judicials . Oh you know that ?
CREASY: That 's right .
CREASY: Come in . The door opens . It 's Lisa .
LISA: Mr. Creasy , I wanted to make sure you have everything you need .
CREASY: I 'm fine .
LISA: Is the food alright ? Maria tells me that you did n't eat .
CREASY: The food 's fine . Sometimes I do n't eat .
LISA: It insults Maria . Slip it to the dog if you have to Do you mind if I talk to you for a moment ?
CREASY: We 'll be okay once she realizes I 'm not a new toy .
LISA: Yes , she told me . Do you have children , Mr. Creasy ?
CREASY: No .
LISA: You should know they 're tenacious when they want something . And Pinta wants to e friends .
CREASY: You 're paying me to protect her , not amuse her . Right ? A beat and then Lisa nods .
LISA: No , you 're right . You were hired to protect her , that 's enough . I 'm confident you 'll do that .
CREASY: It is serious , Mrs. Ramos .
LISA: Please , it 's Lisa I 'll be coming with you tomorrow . I have lunch with friends .
RONSTADT: `` I 'm going back someday , come what may , to Blue Bayou ''
LINDA RONSTADT: Well I 'll never be blue , my dreams come true , on Blue Bayou
RAYBURN: Rayburn Creasy ! What 's wrong ?
CREASY: I said , have you ever had a nine millimeter round that just did n't go off ?
RAYBURN: You mean a misfire ?
CREASY: I mean nothing . The hammer came down and nothing happened . Dimple on the primer .
RAYBURN: I 've heard of it . Never happened to me though . Maybe the firing pin 's off .
CREASY: Maybe
RAYBURN: It 's like we always used to say a bullet always tells the truth . What were you shooting at ?
CREASY: Sorry I woke you , Ray .
LISA: The traffic takes some getting used to .
LISA: She has swimming practice today . You 'll need to pick her up at the pool .
JORDAN: So you 're the bodyguard ? You used to be , what did they used to call it , a soldier of fortune ?
EVELYN: Does he talk ?
JORDAN: You see any danger out there ? The fear 's worse than the reality . Just a blankness from Creasy .
CREASY: I was n't hired to guard Mr. Ramos .
JORDAN: For Pinta then ?
LISA: Jordan !
CREASY: If something happened , my reaction would e to fight to protect her . I have skills in that respect . Pinta would enefit by the fact that I 'm a soldier .
JORDAN: What kind of an answer is that ?
CREASY: The answer is the truth . The question is foolish .
LISA: Jordan , thank you for the lovely lunch . I promise not to let Evelyn spend too much .
CREASY: You 're fast .
RONSTADT: `` I 'm so lonesome all the time , since I left my baby behind , on Blue Bayou . ''
LISA: I 'll call you from Detroit , baby .
SAMUEL: You enjoy it for us , Pinta .
CREASY: They 'll be back in a week .
MARIA: My pleasure , Creasy .
CREASY: Pinta !
LISA: You 're sure she 's alright ?
CREASY: White lie . I did n't have a family . But I did have two kids . They 're adults now .
CREASY: Bang !
LISA: Creasy , tomorrow , after you drop off Pinta , could you come back to take me to get my hair done ?
CREASY: Do n't move .
LISA: Murdering people in the street You had your gun , why did n't you shoot them ? The shoulders in front of her just shrug .
CREASY: Nothing to do with me . Or you . Besides , there was another one in the passenge side of the van with a sawed-off shotgun . If I 'd started shooting his friends , he would 've had me . And you .
SAMUEL: I want to thank you , Creasy . For what you did for my wife .
LINDA RONSTADT: I 'm going back someday , come what may , to Blue Bayou .
CREASY: Your father has business .
SISTER ANNA: Mr. Creasy , nice to see you . And now Creasy is completely out of place .
CREASY: Pinta 's parents are in Los Angeles . I was going to wait in the courtyard , ut She takes his arm , pats his hand .
SISTER ANNA: Today you are her father .
RAYBURN: All but one . The most important one . When we were eighteen , we made an agreement to `` take the world '' together .
CREASY: Then one day , he calls and says , ' I 'm in love and I 'm moving to Mexico . ' I said what happened to the plan ?

K&R AGENT: No , not usNo we did not .
RAYBURN: She 's dead Creasy . Creasy blinks away a solitary tear .
MANZANO: She 's dead . They fucked with 'the process ' and his nephew died .
DOCTOR: He suffered gunshot wounds to the uppe extremity , chest and abdomen . He has a collapsed lung which is stabilized , injured his spleen , which we may have to emove and ruptured his intestine . He 's on strict bedrest or there 's a good chance we could lose him .

MANZANO: No . It would be convenient , but no . As Manzano packs up his mugshot books
CREASY: Show me mugshots of Mexican policemen . Maybe then we 'll get somewhere .
MANZANO: All these photos you just saw were of policemen . Sadly they 're protected . La Hermanidad . The brotherhood .

RAYBURN: I 'll get you up to the border . Friend of mine 'll take you in to San Diego . Drop you right at the hospital .
CREASY: Got a thing I got ta do first .
FEMALE VOICE: Creasy Creasy wheels . There 's Rosanna .
ROSANNA: A lot of people are looking for you .
CREASY: I guess that makes you the smart one .
CREASY: It 's a little late .
ROSANNA: What are you going to do ? Creasy does n't answer .
CREASY: Thank you . He walks away towards Rayburn .
LISA: You let them take her . She loved you and you let them take her .
CREASY: Because I was already dead .
LISA: Creasy He turns , but she does n't look back at him .
CREASY: Blue Bayou is a dream , Pinta . Like you .
RAYBURN: You 'll be Stateside by suppertime .
CREASY: I 'm going to need help , Ray .
RAYBURN: Fuck . Look at you ; you wo n't last a day the shape you 're in . Unless you stop leeding you should have your spleen emoved .
CREASY: Yes or no ?
RAYBURN: I wo n't kill again . Hunt people . I gave that up . Anything else ? It 's yours .
RAYBURN: Candy store . Every town in Mexico has one if you know what door to bang on . Creasy stops by the pistols .
CREASY: I 'll take the .45 and the Webley .32 .
RAYBURN: I know it 's old fashioned , but it 's eliable . Like us .
CREASY: I need less than standard packing . Can you knock up a case for fifteen of each ?
RAYBURN: Different door . Not far from here .
CREASY: Maybe I can help your situation and you mine .
ROSANNA: So where do we begin ?
CREASY: I need the name and address of the owne of a Toyota Corolla , license numbe ME31704We did n't get the last digit so I need the ten possible matches .
ROSANNA: So what do I get in return ?
CREASY: Let 's see how the relationship develops . I 'll call you in the AM . Thanks . Creasy hangs up .
MANZANO: He 'll die of his wounds ; bleed to death efore he can do anything .
ROSANNA: He sounded strong to me . Stronger than we are . Rosanna pauses .
MANZANO: We did voice analysis of the last five high profile kidnappings , including the little girl . The same man 'The Dreamer ' . Listen to this .

ROSANNA: He 's protected by La Hermanidad .
MANZANO: I know this . Your point ?
ROSANNA: Creasy is not a policeman . My sense is he could be very valuable to us . Rosanna waits for a response . None .
MANZANO: It 's a moral issue . On one hand you 're cleaning up the bad guys , but in anothe way we are feeding the problem that produces bad guys .
CREASY: Drive .
JORGE: Do you know who I am ?
CREASY: You are Jorge Ramirez . Creasy jams him in the gut again .

CREASY: Where do I find him ?
JORGE: I do n't know . No one knows .
CREASY: I believe you .
JORGE: I 'm professional . I just do my job .
CREASY: Me , too . Tell me about the guardians .
JORGE: He called me on the cell phone to set a time and location for the switch .
CREASY: Who 's he ?
JORGE: The one who transferred Pinta to thei car .
CREASY: Who 's he ?
JORGE: I do n't know , but I know his face . Creasy cocks the trigger .
CREASY: How do I recognize him .
JORGE: He has a tattoo covering two-thirds of his back . He is part of the Brotherhood .

CREASY: Who 's the boss ?
GUARDIAN TWO: We do n't know ! We never see his face ! We have to wait in the other room . He was screaming to the girl that

GUARDIAN TWO: The ransom money . At the drop . He said Tazinari , one of the policemen had taken it . He was crazy .
CREASY: Who 's Tazinari ?
GUARDIAN TWO: Head of the antikidnapping division .
CREASY: Show me .
FEMALE GUARDIAN: He was screaming about the money and his dead nephew . He threw the little girl against the wall .
CREASY: Who ? Who 's they ?
FEMALE GUARDIAN: The boss 's brother , I recognize his voice . It 's high pitched . We call him Woody Woodpecker .
CREASY: Now listen to me . If you tell me where to find the boss . I will let you live .

CREASY: I 'll call you tomorrow .
ROSANNA: He 's an old fashioned patrone with the worst reputation . He 's high on my hit list .
CREASY: Where does he live ?
ROSANNA: He lives in a Judicial Compound . He travels by motorcade . He has bette protection than George Bush . Even more importantly he is part of La Hermanidad . His reach is far and wide .
CREASY: Give me the address .
ADJUTANT: Two in one day . And they died very adly . Sandri and Jorge were prime suspects in twelve kidnappings in the last six months . Manzano studies the photo of Jorge .
MANZANO: Whoever did this was methodical , unafraid . Was Jorge 's mugshot in the photos we showed Creasy ?
ADJUTANT: No , I checked . But right after Sandri was shot , a girlfriend of his was found naked , hysterical in the street . She said it was a man fitting Creasy 's description who shot him .
MANZANO: Mr. Creasy was , and maybe is again , a very lethal human being .
ADJUTANT: You do n't seem very surprised ?
MANZANO: What 's surprising these days ?
AGENT: Your man 's here . Interrogation room two .
MANZANO: Pollo Pibil . Chicken and chorizo sausage . Hmmmh . They marinate it in lemon and orange juice . It 's a stew eally .
RAYBURN: I already ate . Manzano enjoys another bite , then
MANZANO: Tell me about your friend Creasy .
RAYBURN: You just said it . He 's my friend . Nothing else to say .
MANZANO: I read the file . You and Creasy have seen quite a bit together .
RAYBURN: Two tourists who never went home .
MANZANO: You helped him get this job .
RAYBURN: That 's what friends do .
MANZANO: Yes . But if I traced Creasy to you , others will do it as well . Thei facilities are as good as my own , if not etter .
RAYBURN: I can take care of myself .
MANZANO: You and Creasy both . A two man army according to Interpol . Panama . Lebanon with the Druze . Desert Storm . Where you were contracted by the U.S. Army to hunt down elite Iraqi military commanders . You two were a married couple .
RAYBURN: The kind that gets divorced , but still stay friends .
MANZANO: What happened to him ? What happened to Creasy ? Rayburn flinches at some bitter memory .
RAYBURN: None of your business . Or mine for that matter . I got nothing more to say .
MANZANO: This is my jurisdiction . I want these men as much as Creasy does .
RAYBURN: He 'll deliver more justice in a weekend , than ten years of your courts and tribunals . So stay out of his way .
MANZANO: I plan to . I 'll even help him if I can . He 's going to lead me to the 'The Dreamer ' . Someone I want very badly . But I 'd like to understand him . Give me that .
RAYBURN: Pinta Martin Ramos is just a number to you . Tragic , a public outcry , but a number . One more dead .
MANZANO: What was she to Creasy then ?
RAYBURN: Light . At the end of a long , dark tunnel . Somehow , she showed him it was alright to live again .
MANZANO: And they took that away .
RAYBURN: A man can be an artist in anything . Stone , paint , words . Food . Anything if his soul is true to it . Creasy 's art is death . And he 's about to paint his masterpiece .
MANZANO: Is it true ? Creasy saved the little girl that was kidnapped yesterday .
ROSANNA: And left three more dead men .
MANZANO: When you talked to him , did he look sane ?
ROSANNA: No . Not by the rules of polite society at least .
MANZANO: I think he 's magnificent .
ROSANNA: You only give information so you can fuck me .
MANZANO: A beautiful circle . He kisses her , turned on again already .
ROSANNA: Let 's put Creasy to press . There 's a vigilante cleaning up Mexico . An unstoppable hero .
MANZANO: I should start going for your tits first .
CREASY: I 'm not here to hurt you . I need to orrow your house and your car . Are you the proud owners of the Coupe deVille ?
CREASY: If you promise to speak softly and not to shout , I wo n't have to tape your mouths .
OLD MAN: I know of you . You 're the American . The odyguard who 's killing the kidnapper .
CREASY: Forgiveness is between them and God . It 's my job to arrange the meeting .
TAZINARI: Do you know who I am ? I am the commandante of the Judicial anti- kidnapping division .
CREASY: And one of the founding members of La Hermanidad .
TAZINARI: Correct !
CREASY: That 's not my dick . That 's the barrel of your own gun . Shoved up your own ass . As Tazinari reacts
TAZINARI: Please , do n't
CREASY: It 's all up to you , commandante . Tell me about you and 'The Dreamer ' .
TAZINARI: I do n't know him . I saw the opportunity and got lucky .
CREASY: Lucky how ?
TAZINARI: That he used policemen . That you killed them , it made it a police matter . The Ramos family could n't refuse ou involvement .
CREASY: And ?
TAZINARI: And I had my men ready .
CREASY: You stole the drop .
TAZINARI: Yes . Many times .
CREASY: O.K . So tell me more .
TAZINARI: There was no ten million dollars .
CREASY: The ransom was ten .
TAZINARI: Two and a half . That 's how much there was .
CREASY: Do n't lie to me !
TAZINARI: Two and a half ! The rest was paper ! Strips of paper !
CREASY: Maybe your men stole from you .
TAZINARI: No . Whoever took the rest took it before the exchange .
CREASY: Who gave the bags to Ramos ?
TAZINARI: His lawyer . Jordan Kalfus .
CREASY: That 's what everybody keeps saying .
CREASY: Another favor get me banking info on Jordan Kalfus . U.S. deposits o withdrawals . Thanks . Oh , get me the same on Samuel Ramos .
ROSANNA: How do I contact you ? We still do n't have the ATM info .
CREASY: You do n't , I 'll call you . Oh ! I have a tape recording that I am sure will interest you .
LISA: Planned what ?
CREASY: An autosequestra . Kalfus arranged fo Pinta to be taken to a safehouse . I 'm sure he thought she 'd sit there for three days eating pizza and watching TV . It did n't work out that way . Everything got fucked up when I killed the cops and Tazinari saw an opportunity .
SAMUEL: Our lifestyle was in jeopardy . My pain and weakness only fueled your anger and determination . I was n't sure about whether to go through with it or not . Then I woke up one day and it was done . Jordan was supposed to take care of it .
CREASY: A bullet does not lie . A bullet tells the truth . And the truth will set you free . Creasy hands Samuel the gun .
ROSANNA'S VOICE: Creasy .
ROSANNA: I traced the PIN . I have an address fo you . But I need to see you .
CREASY: I show , you give me the information ?
ROSANNA: Deal .
CREASY: Where ?
TECHNICIAN: We got the whole place wiretapped . But no males that sound anything like 'The Dreamer ' .
MANZANO: He 'll show .
ROSANNA: Who 's that ?
MANZANO: He 's the man , 'the Boss ? ' My guys got into the house on the pretext of giving cholera shots . We had to inject the whole Barrio . We bugged the house and stole the picture of him . Manzano looks at Rosanna . Now 's the time to really pressure him . Lets publish his picture in tomorrow 's edition .
ROSANNA: So how are going to recipricate ?
CREASY: I 'm looking for Rosanna Guerrero .
OWNER: This way .
MANZANO: Hombre en fuego . Man On Fire . That 's what the papers have named you .
CREASY: It 's what you and Rosanna named me . Right ?
MANZANO: Sit , Creasy . Everything that happens from now on does so with my permission . Really . You wo n't find a better carne asada in all of Mexico .
CREASY: What do you want ?
MANZANO: The same thing as you . Except , my reach is n't as long as yours . My father was a policemen , did you know that ?
CREASY: I do n't know shit about you .
MANZANO: He was one of the original founders of 'Le Hermanidad ' in the days when it epresented good not evil . Manzano smiles ; he likes Creasy .
CREASY: It 's not worth it . Be with them instead .
MANZANO: It galls me to watch you . You can do as much in days as I can in years . Men like the 'The Dreamer ' are protected . Out of everyone 's grasp it seems , but yours .
CREASY: Are you going to arrest me or talk me to death ?
MANZANO: My country needs justice . Prope justice . Gunning men down in the street only feeds the violence . They need to e brought to trial . Dealt with properly . Then people will respect the law . When they see it works .
CREASY: So you are going to talk me to death .
MANZANO: You walk out and deal justice . You 're what I wish I could be . The policemen who kills you , his family will have all they want .
CREASY: Then I hope the one who gets me has got lots of kids . What do you want ?
MANZANO: I want to arrest you for murder ! I want to shake your hand and reload your gun ! I want to kill my pride and give you my lessing .
CREASY: My deal is with Rosanna . I knew you guys were up to something . Are you two fucking ?
MANZANO: No , but I have to admit I thought about it .
CREASY: Liar . Just tell me who the bank card elongs to . Name and address .
MANZANO: You have no interest in making things easy , do you ?
CREASY: I 'm not easy .
MANZANO: Percodan . I imagine you need handfuls by now .
CREASY: Off the top of my head , I do n't know what they could 've been . As Creasy departs
CREASY'S VOICE: Romans chapter 13 4 - therefore whoeve esists authority will bring judgment on themselves . Now it is time to awake out of sleep for our salvation is nearer than we first believed .
VOICE: He 's inside . What should we do ?
MANZANO: Do nothing .

REINA: Si .
CREASY: How do you contact 'the Boss ' ? Reina hesitates .
REINA: We page him and he calls back on this cell phone .
CREASY: What is his name ?
REINA: Daniel .
CREASY: Daniel what ? He pulls the hammer back .
REINA: Daniel Rosas Sanchez .
CREASY: So you 're married to him ? And this looks emarkably like his brother .
REINA: Aurillio Rosas Sanchez .
TECHNICIAN: What do we do ?
CREASY: Hello Daniel . I 've got your family and I want to negotiate .
DANIEL: Mr. Creasy . What do you want ?
CREASY: I want you .
DANIEL: How much do you want ?
CREASY: It 's non-negotiable .
DANIEL: Two million U.S. Three million U.S. ?
CREASY: I told you , non-negotiable . Daniel hangs up .
MANZANO: Damn .
CREASY: Yeah .
DANIEL: The most important thing in life is family . And there you are . You have my family . What do you want ?
CREASY: I want you .
DANIEL: This is not possible . But in that house I have money . If I tell you where
CREASY: Your brother wants to talk to you .
AURILLIO: Daniel ?
CREASY: Listen to me . Listen ! I 'm going to take your family apart piece by piece .
REINA: Under the sink . We have money under the sink . Six million dollars . It 's wet but good .
CREASY: Yeah . Yes .
DANIEL: Listen ! I will give you a life for a life .
CREASY: What do you mean ?
DANIEL: Her life for your life . Creasy 's confused .
CREASY: Whose life ? Creasy 's confused .
DANIEL: The girl 's . Pinta 's .
CREASY: You 're a liar . Pinta 's dead .
DANIEL: I 'm a businessman . A dead girl is worth nothing . She is alive . A long beat .
CREASY: I want proof of life . What did she call her bear ? DANIEL hangs up .
DANIEL: Creasy . She calls the bear 'Creasy Bear . '
CREASY: Okay . Where ?
TEAM LEADER: We received enough of a signal to at least put him in the Zona Colonia . Shit not enough time . He hung up .
CREASY: Lisa , do n't hang up on me . Pinta is alive .
LISA: I do n't believe you .
CREASY: I want you to get into your car now and meet me on the south end of the footbridge between Reforma and the freeway junction . In 45 minutes .
LISA: You 're lying . I do n't believe you .
CREASY: Then do n't come .

CREASY: Stay here . If you do something stupid , we wo n't get her back .
MANZANO: I 'm your chauffeur now , Creasy .

ED: Well whoever the fuck that is , I 'm firing him !
GEORGE: Okay . But we 'll have to warn Andy first . I think he 's up in San Francisco , doing a concert . Heh ? Ed raises his eyebrows .
ED: No , no , Andy , nothing like that . But Tony 's not fitting in . His style of performance is too urlesque .
GEORGE: There 'll be other shots .
ED: Andy , I have to do it . He 's a terrible actor . Andy thinks about this .
TONY CLIFTON: FUCK YOU ! I AI N'T GOIN ' ! !
ED: We had a deal ! !
TONY CLIFTON: I do n't know what yer talkin ' about . You musta talked to someone else
ED: Yeah ! ! I talked to Andy Kaufman !
TONY CLIFTON: I do n't know nothin ' about no Kaufman . He 's been ridin ' my coattails , smearing my reputation . Been usin ' my good name , to get places .
ED: Get off my stage ! You 're fired !
TONY CLIFTON: I GOT A CONTRACT ! ! I 'm gon na take you to the DEPARTMENT OF LABOR !
ED: Who 're YOU ? !

TONY CLIFTON: Stop ! GETCHER HANDS OFF ME ! Tony scuffles . The camera FLASHES . TONY CLIFTON

SECURITY GUARD: This is a closed set . You 'll have to give me the film in that camera .
ZMUDA: I 'll take care of this .
ED: Wait he 's one of THEM ! Zmuda gasps . Two guards go running for him .
TONY CLIFTON: Stop ! HELP ! You would n't do this to Wayne Newton
ED: That asshole ! That FUCKING
SECRETARY: Um , Ed you have a phone call
ED: I 'M NOT IN !
SECRETARY: Well , um it 's Andy Kaufman
ED: Yeah ? ? ?
ANDY: This is great ! It makes Tony REAL - - three-dimensional ! It 's very good for his career . Zmuda reads one paragraph .
ZMUDA: `` Was this in actuality Andy Kaufman ? And if it was Andy Kaufman , is Andy Kaufman crazy ? ''
ANDY: Boy , they totally fell for it ! I 'm only acting crazy ! Hmm . A few awkward glances . Then Andy grins at his meal . ANDY Boy , this is tasty . ( he shouts to a
WAITER: Hey , can I please have some more seaweed ? !
BOOKER: Mr. Shapiro , this is Gene Knight , up at Harrah 's Tahoe . We 'd like to ook Andy Kaufman for our showroom .
GEORGE: Ehh Andy does n't really like playing casinos . The audiences do n't work well for him .
PUSHY MAN: You 're not listenin ' ! It 's a VERY simple concept .
TONY CLIFTON: SHUT UP ! ! ! ! ! !
PUSHY MAN: He 's never gon na start ! Kaufman thinks this is funny ! We 've paid forty bucks for a show that 's never gon na start !
TONY CLIFTON: Thank you ! Thank you ! I wrote this tune for my friend Frank Sinatra . He had a nice little success with it but forgot to thank me on the album . He starts to BELT `` I Got ta Be Me '' .
GEORGE: You 're so proud . You 're like some etarded kid comin ' home from school `` Look , Dad , I got an F ! ''
ANDY: But was n't it funny ?
GEORGE: `` Funny '' ? I dunno . But `` intriguing '' `` mindboggling '' perhaps `` headache-inducing '' sure . Like , that moment , when you both came onstage Andy excitedly jumps up and down .
ANDY: Uh-huh ! See , with all these articles , people think they 're insiders . They see Tony Clifton , and they say , `` Ah , that 's really Andy Kaufman . '' But that spoils it . So NOW , Tony denying being me is the truth ! Tony 's not me ! But maybe he is ! The audience will never know They 'll think they 're laughin ' at me but actually I 'll be laughin ' at them , because they 're wrong and I 'm ight ! George is dazed .
GEORGE: So you 've got this big elaborate joke , which is really only funny to two people in the universe . You and you .
ZMUDA: Sure ! But WE think it 's kickass ! Now I get to be Tony . I get to dump the glass of water on someone else 's head !
GEORGE: But what 's the POINT ? How will any of this make you the biggest star in the world ? Hmm . Andy contemplates this .
ANDY: George I 'm at a stage where the audience expects me to constantly shock them . But short of faking my death , or setting the theater on fire , I do n't know what else to do . 'Cause I 've always got to be one step ahead of them .
GEORGE: But I feel you 're extending this philosophy to real life . It 's obsessive . Nothing 's ever on the level anymore . A perplexed beat .
ANDY: George , it never was . Did n't you know that ?
ZMUDA: What is this , World War Two ?
ANDY: You know , I always wanted to be a ad-guy wrestler
ZMUDA: No offense , pal , but I just do n't think you 're built for it . These he- men 'll kick your ass ! ! They 're huge !
ANDY: Maybe I 'll pick on someone smalle than me !
MERV: By a woman .
ANDY: Yes ! BY A WOMAN ! I 'm doing this because I feel that a woman can not beat a man in wrestling . Even if they train with weights it requires a certain mental ability And , uh I just do n't feel they have that
MERV: Any volunteers ?
LYNNE: I wan na kill that jerk .
ANDY: I 'm the winner ! I 've got the
GUEST COORDINATOR: Here 's your complimentary photo with Merv . Here 's your Turtle Wax
LYNNE: I do n't need Turtle Wax .
GUEST COORDINATOR: Every guest of Merv gets it . And here 's your dinner-for-two vouche at Red Lobster .
ANDY: Gosh , you scored ! Look at all those goodies !
LYNNE: Buzz off . Go patronize somebody else .
ANDY: Hey , I hope you did n't take that stuff I said seriously . It was just part of the show ! It 's like the old days , when a carnival barker would try to rile up the crowd .
LYNNE: Oh . So you were just pretending to e an asshole . Andy nods , pleased .
ANDY: It 's what I 'm good at !
GEORGE: Merv Griffin has received 2000 pieces of hate mail . Andy , Merv Griffin does n't GET hate mail .
ANDY: That means it was a success . I woke up the audience like punk rock ! ( he hands him a
BARBELL: Here , take this .
GEORGE: No , I 'm not gon na take it . If I take it I 'll break my back .
ANDY: They 're having a laugh
GEORGE: WRONG ! You have n't given them any clues that it 's a parody !
ANDY: That 's because they 've only seen it once . But I 'll do it again , and again , and AGAIN They 'll catch on !
LYNNE: Hi am I late ?

LYNNE: Fine .
ANDY: Gosh . Gee , Lynne I was just so impressed with your wrestling moves .
LYNNE: You were impressed with something . It 's pretty odd when a man sports a hard-on that large on national television . Andy is shocked .
ANDY: Oh ! Uh , I hope I did n't offend you .
LYNNE: I 'm here , ai n't I ?
ANDY: Do you wan na to go to Memphis and get married ?
LYNNE: Do I wan na go to Memphis and get married ?
ANDY: Yes . Beat .
LYNNE: Why Memphis ?
ANDY: ( he SPEAKS VERY
FAST: Because Memphis is the wrestling capital of the world ! I 'll go in the ring , and I 'll announce that I will shave my head and marry any woman who beats me ! Then you 'll come up , we 'll wrestle and I 'll let you win ! Then you 'll scalp me , and we 'll get married on Letterman , like Tiny Tim did on Carson right there on the show ! What do you say ? ? ? Whoa . Lynne stares into his eyes .
LYNNE: And all this will be for real ?
ANDY: If you want
LYNNE: Look here , Andy Kaufman ! I 'll take you on SISSY ! The mob LAUGHS harshly .
ANDY: Ooo , the little lady 's upset . Well I say get back in the kitchen !
LYNNE: No ! YOU get in the kitchen . I 'm gon na make you dry my dishes !
MAN: STOP IT ! This woman 's a FAKE ! She 's nothing but Kaufman 's girlfriend ! Andy and Lynne are startled .
ANDY: T-that 's not true
MAN: It 's a set-up ! And I wo n't allow our great sport to be degraded by a fix ! !
LYNNE: Andy who is that ?
LAWLER: I 'm Jerry Lawler , the KING of Memphis wrestling ! ! ( this gets HUGE
CHEERS: So if Kaufman wants to tangle , I 've ought a real wrestler ! She 's trained and she 's READY ! ! Kaufman , do you think you can handle FOXY

LAWLER: Alright , you won . GET OFF HER !
ANGRY VOICES: Jerry , help her ! Get in there ! Do something !
ANDY: W-what are you DOING ? I do n't fight men !
LAWLER: YEAH ? ! Well I got news for you , Andy Kaufman ! Wrestling is a serious sport to me ! I do n't like anyone makin ' fun of it , and I hate anyone insultin ' the South ! So we can settle this two ways We can go to court or you can get in the ing with a man , and wrestle fo

ACCENT: You wan na `` wraaastle '' me ? ! You wan na `` WRAAASTLE '' me ? ? ? Okay , Lawler let 's rumble ! Yeah , I 've only wrestled women , but they were igger than you !

And Mr. Lawler , I 'm gon na make you cry `` Mama ! ''
LYNNE: Is this an act or are you addicted to causing trouble ? ?
ANDY: I can shtop whenever I want She 's unamused .
LYNNE: Then stop treating me like a fucking prop .
ANDY: I-I 'm sorry . I got caught up in the action ! She shoots him a stern look .
LYNNE: I 'm warning you , Kaufman One morning you 're gon na wake up and your head 's gon na be shaved . Andy laughs .
GEORGE: Andy , do you realize you do n't do comedy anymore ? Where 's that sweet guy who used to do `` Here I come to save the day ! '' ? Please , enough with the wrestling ! You 've lost touch with reality !
ANDY: What , you do n't think I can beat him ?
GEORGE: He is the Southern Heavyweight Champion . He 'll kill you . First , you piss-off women . Then you piss-off the South . Then you get killed ! And I did the bookings .
ANDY: You said live ?
JACK BURNS: Andy , it 'll be fine ! It 's what we 're known for ! `` Maui ? `` Wowie ! ''
ANDY: You 're not listening to me
JACK BURNS: Do n't worry ! The kids will love it

ANDY: I 'm fine , Mom , you can calm down . A confused beat .
STANLEY: B-but we saw your neck

OLD DOCTOR: I do n't see any injury to your neck , Mr. Kaufman .
ANDY: Are you sure ?
OLD DOCTOR: Positive .
ANDY: But my neck hurts and I have a slight cough
OLD DOCTOR: It 's probably just a strained muscle .
ANDY: Doctor , I think I need a neck brace . The Doctor gives up .
OLD DOCTOR: If it makes you happy
ZMUDA: `` has been rushed to a nearby hospital , where doctors are checking him for possible paralysis . His parents are at his bedside . Fans will best remember Kaufman as lovable Latka on television 's Taxi ''
ANDY: It 's a rave ! Boy , if I ever fake my death , they 'll really miss me .
ZMUDA: It 's working for Elvis .
GEORGE: Yeah , he 's just laying low , waitin ' for his comeback . God , listen to this ! `` It was morally wrong to take advantage of such an unstable individual ''
ZMUDA: Wow , you ca n't BUY this kind of publicity ! George rolls his eyes .
ANDY: George , let 's not drop the ball on this . I 've made some kind of cosmic career move .
GEORGE: Thanks for seeing me on such short notice . I I wanted to talk to you about ooking Andy on `` Saturday Night Live . ''
LORNE MICHAELS: George I do n't know if Andy works for our show anymore . That wrestling stuff is such a turnoff .
GEORGE: We agree completely . Andy has to reconnect with his core audience . So I got him on Letterman tonight . He 's gon na apologize to Jerry Lawler , then repent for all his bad guy shenanigans . Lorne Michaels mulls this over .
LORNE MICHAELS: That 's smart .
GEORGE: He 's very sincere . And he needs your show Beat . Lorne Michaels nods .
LORNE MICHAELS: Okay . It 'd be good to have the old Andy back .
ANDY: I apologize for all the wrestling I 've ever done . I 'm sorry for all the abuse I 've ever given I was just playing bad guy wrestler . That 's not me it 's just a role . But Jerry took it personally . Lawler and Letterman are unimpressed .
LETTERMAN: You said some pretty inflammatory things .
LAWLER: He thinks everything 's a joke but it 's not . Did you laugh when you were layin ' in the hospital ? ? The crowd WHOOOOS .
ANDY: T-there was n't a reason to purposely hurt me
LAWLER: You 're a wimp .
ANDY: My father said I should 've gotten a lawyer !
LAWLER: Then your father 's a wimp .
ANDY: And you 're just poor white trash !
LETTERMAN: You said some pretty inflammatory things .
LAWLER: He thinks everything 's a joke but it 's not . Did you laugh when you were layin ' in the hospital ? ? The crowd WHOOOOS .
ANDY: T-there was n't a reason to purposely hurt me
LAWLER: You 're a wimp .
ANDY: My father said I should 've gotten a lawyer !
LAWLER: Then your father 's a wimp .
ANDY: And you 're just poor white trash !
LORNE MICHAELS: Jesus Christ .
SMUG COMIC: Hi . Um , we were supposed to have Andy Kaufman on our show this week - - but now our producers are n't sure if it 's such a good idea . Some of us at Saturday Night Live think Kaufman 's a comic genius . But others disagree they say he 's just not funny anymore . So we 're putting the decision up to you . Please call up and vote . To keep Andy , call 1-900-244-7618 . To DUMP him , call
ANDY: This is bad I only got 28 percent ! I 'm like McGovern in
GEORGE: And this was n't `` Merv . '' This was the hippest audience on television . They 've turned on you .
ANDY: We were just trying to push the envelope
GEORGE: You 're BLIND ! There is no envelope anymore ! ! It hurts me to say this but there 's only one solution I do n't want you two to ever work together again . We WIDEN
JERRY LAWLER: I 'm sorry . We thought it was funny
ANDY: Jer ' , it 's not your fault . You were terrific . But maybe George is right
JERRY LAWLER: That 's fine . But I would n't have traded it for anything Because for one brief , shining moment the world thought that wrestling was real . Andy gulps emotionally .
ANDY: We 'll stay in touch . Next time I 'm in Memphis , I 'll stop by the house , and Noreen can make me her double chocolate cake .
JERRY LAWLER: Alright , buddy Stay good . Andy and Jerry hug .
ANDY: Maybe I can turn it into a bit . I can go back on the show , and say it was rigged . Demand a recount
GEORGE: Andy ! You do n't get it ! They do n't want you back . Andy 's face drops .
ANDY: Open your eyes close your eyes open your eyes close your eyes open your eyes close your eyes
YOGI: Excuse me , Andy
ANDY: Yes , your Holiness ?
YOGI: This is very difficult for me to say but perhaps it would be est if you did n't attend the etreat .
ANDY: Why ? ? I I attend every year .
YOGI: Yes we do not doubt your devotion to TM . But we feel that perhaps you and the program have grown apart philosophically . Andy is stunned .
ANDY: `` Philosophically '' ?
YOGI: The wrestling the sexist emarks the foul language these things are not becoming of an enlightened individual . It seems you have no respect fo anything .
ANDY: Of course I do
YOGI: It is apparently not working .
ANDY: So HELP ME ! All I wan na do is
YOGI: Andy , do n't raise your voice . We do n't wish your presence here . Andy is broken .
ANDY: Go away .
LYNNE: I brought you Haagen Dazs . Chocolate .
ANDY: I do n't deserve Haagen Daz . I 'm a horrible person .
LYNNE: Andy , you 're not horrible . You 're just complicated .
ANDY: You do n't know the real me .
LYNNE: Andy there is no real you .
ANDY: You 're probably right . They both giggle .
BUDD: And now we have a treat for you late- night diehards . The star of Taxi here in person , Andy Kaufman !
ANDY: Actually , Budd , you 're wrong . I found out today that Taxi 's been canceled . The crowd AWWWWS sadly . Andy blinks . ANDY Yeah , that 's how I felt too though I do n't know why . 'Cause fo years , all I wanted to do was get off that show . But now that nobody will hire me , and nobody thinks I 'm funny I guess it was probably a pretty good job . One guy LAUGHS sharply .
BUDD: This is a comedy club not a medical sideshow . If you wan na perform here , take a shower , get some sleep , and pull yourself together . Come back and do the material that people love Do the Mighty Mouse , the Foreign guy ! Andy , you got ta snap out of this funk ! If you can I 'll give you the headline spot tomorrow . Andy thinks . The wheels are spinning .
GEORGE: Hey , what 's going on here ?
BUDD: George , you wo n't believe it I got Andy to do all the old material ! And he 's killin ' them !
ANDY: Sir , do you have a problem ?
GEORGE: Why ? Andy , why ?
ZMUDA: I used to think you were original .
ANDY: I was very original !
ZMUDA: Yeah , exactly `` was '' ! But now , you 're creatively bankrupt . In fact , Ladies and Gentlemen , Kaufman 's so desperate , he PAID me to do this tonight ! ! I 'm a plant . It 's just a fresh coat of paint on an old broken-down routine . Is n't that true ? ? ? Andy shudders . The audience averts their eyes . A painful silence . `` Andy Kaufman '' has been destroyed .
ANDY: The world thinks Andy Kaufman sucks . So I was just giving 'em what they want
GEORGE: Andy , they do n't think you suck . They 've just lost a reason to love you . The guys stop walking . George gently speaks . GEORGE You 've got ta make the public embrace you again . You have to win back their sympathy
ANDY: I 'll come up with something .
LYNNE: Andy ! ! Where are you ? I 've been worried sick NOW ? ? Where do you want to meet ? Okay , I 'll call them Lynne 's baffled .
ZMUDA: Look at that Grand Slam ! Two eggs , two bacon , two sausage , two pancakes $ 2.99 ! How do they do it ?
LYNNE: They get you on the coffee .
GEORGE: Excuse me but could Andy tell us why we 're here ? ? ? All heads turn . A long pause . Then Andy stiffly speaks .
ANDY: I have cancer . Beat . Zmuda nods .
ZMUDA: Hey , that 's good ! We can make that play . And we 'll really drag it out . You get better , you get worse you die
GEORGE: FORGET IT . It 's in terrible taste ! I want nothing to do with this . Pause . Lynne is puzzled .
LYNNE: Andy , are you serious ?
ZMUDA: Serious like a heart attack ! Hey , maybe I can push you around in some goofy wheelchair ! Andy softly shakes his head .
ANDY: No , it 's true . I have lung cancer .
GEORGE: That 's ridiculous . You do n't even smoke .
ANDY: I I got some freaky rare kind . It 's called large-celled carcinoma . Lynne 's eyes tear up . She hugs onto Andy .
LYNNE: Jesus , Andy ! Can they cure it ?
ANDY: They do n't know they 've got ta run more tests .
LYNNE: Have you told your family ?
ANDY: No , NO ! Not yet . I feel bad I 've jerked 'em around so many times .
GEORGE: Andy you look me in the eye , and tell me this is true . Andy gulps .
ANDY: George it 's true .
GEORGE: If I find out you 're behind this , I 'll kill you .
ZMUDA: What are ya TALKIN ' ABOUT ? ! I was the one saying I did n't believe it !
GEORGE: Exactly . That 's the sort of thing you guys would work out to fuck me up .
LYNNE: How can you be so casual ? ? !
ANDY: Even if I 'm dying I still need clean socks .
LYNNE: You 're NOT DYING !
ANDY: Okay . You 're probably right . He keeps working . Lynne loses it .
LYNNE: God , you 're so detached ! ! Lynne storms out .
ANDY: Dad ?
DOCTOR: The cancer started in Andy 's left arm and spread to his lungs . We 've initiated an aggressive radiation program see if we can eradicate the affected cells . Excuse me . I 'll be right back .
CAROL: What a crock .
STANLEY: How dare you make light of this !
CAROL: Dad , I cried when he broke his neck . He 's not gettin ' me again
STANLEY: Jesus ! He 's got lung cancer ! A standoff moment . Carol loses it .
CAROL: See , that 's exactly it ! He picked lung cancer , because he does n't smoke . That makes it weird ! If he 'd picked leukemia , it 'd be totally believable , and we 'd all be going , `` Poor Andy , he 's really sick . '' So he chose lung cancer , ecause he WANTS us to be scratching our heads , saying , `` Is this real ? ''
JANICE: Of course it 's real . We 're in a hospital
MICHAEL: Mom , it 's Cedars-Sinai ! It 's a showbiz hospital ! Andy 's studio friends probably run this place !
CAROL: He plans these things out . He takes over , hires actors Personally , I did n't think that `` doctor '' was very convincing .
MICHAEL: Did you notice his costume had the wrong shoes ?
CAROL: Yeah ! He did n't have doctor shoes !
MICHAEL: We all know he 's talked about faking his own death
STANLEY: Sure but what if he is n't ? My son could be dying and we 're actin ' like we 're on Candid Camera .
ANDY: I see them I see the white cells
GEORGE: What was that all about ?
ANDY: It 's visualization therapy . He 's helping me turn inward and fight the disease . Long beat .
GEORGE: He 's an actor . I remember him in `` The In-Laws . ''
ANDY: Uh , yes that 's true . But he 's also ordained in holistic medicine .
GEORGE: You must take a little pleasure in it .
ANDY: Of course ! But that does n't mean I do n't need everyone 's support ! I ca n't be surrounded by negative energy . George shakes his head .
GEORGE: Andy , you 're surrounded by what you create . You are the KING of negative energy .
ANDY: Y-yeah ? Well , then it has to stop ! Because if these bad vibes get out then everyone will be talkin ' about how sick I am , and it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy , and then I 'm dead .
GEORGE: So how can I help you ?
ANDY: I wan na go back to work and put on a happy show . The best show anybody 's ever seen !
GEORGE: Do you wan na tour the clubs ?
ANDY: No clubs . I wan na reach the TOP ! Carnegie Hall ! George gently smiles .
REPORTER #1: I 'm working on a great cover story I 've got a guy in the lab at Cedars . He says Andy Kaufman is dying of lung cancer . Beat . The room GROANS .
EDITOR: What bullshit ! No . No more Kaufman stories ! He 's burned us too many times !
REPORTER #2: Yeah , he 's definitely not dying . He 's playing Carnegie Hall next month ! The Reporter frowns .
REPORTER #1: Jesus . Only Kaufman would use cancer as a publicity stunt .
ANDY: This is great . The crowd 's gon na love this ! Hey do you still think any of those cowgirls are still alive ?
ZMUDA: I dunno . If they were , they 'd be pushin ' 80 .
ANDY: Well , call SAG . It 'd be cool to get one on the show . I want the evening to build and uild . It 's gon na have the most incredible ending Singers , dancers , the `` Hallelujah Chorus '' then the sky opens , and Santa Claus comes flying down !
ZMUDA: And you say , `` Santa , what am I gettin ' for Christmas ? '' And he says , `` Cancer ! ''
ANDY: No ! NO NO NO ! None of that ! I want this show to be positive !
GEORGE: That 's great but this show 's gon na cost a fortune . Even if it sells out , you 'll still lose eighty grand . Andy smiles .
ANDY: I do n't care about the money . I just want the show to deliver .
GEORGE: So who 's gon na pay for it ?
ANDY: Tony Clifton .
GEORGE: You know Tony does n't have that kind of money .
ANDY: Then he 'll borrow it . I know Tony etter than you do . Even if he has to work another ten years to pay it off , he 'll do it !
GEORGE: Okay , Andy . Will do .
ANDY: Abbu daba , abi abbu daba ! Abbu daba , abu dabu do ! Abbu dabbu da ba do !
AUDIENCE: ABBU DABBU DA BA DO ! !
ANDY: A ba du ba ti la ma na go !
AUDIENCE: A BA DU BA TI LA MA NA GO

AUDIENCE: ABBU DA BA DU
ANDY: Ladies and Gentlemen ! I 'm pleased to announce that we have with us the one surviving cowgirl from that 1931 film , Eleanor `` Cody '' Gould ! !
ELEANOR: Andy this is so overwhelming
ANDY: Well , it 's gettin ' even better ! 'Cause we found one of the original hobby horses ! Do you do you think you could treat us to a few steps from `` Jingle Jangle Jingle '' ?
ZMUDA: Is there a doctor in the house ? ? !
ANDY: Ladies and Gentlemen , she 's alive ! Huge APPLAUSE .
HEALER: Now we 'll place a blue crystal . Very high vibrations . It 's wonderful for it 's healing powers .
ANDY: Okay . Let 's try two of those and one of the pink ones .
ADMINISTRATOR: Your friend is doing four crystal sessions a day , but it 's just not helping .
ZMUDA: I know The cancer 's terminal .
ADMINISTRATOR: Yes . That was n't made particularly clear to us when he checked in
ZMUDA: Look , personally , I think rubbing ocks on people is a load of horseshit . But if it makes Andy happy , that 's all that matters . The man purses his lips .
ADMINISTRATOR: I 'm sorry to sound crass but we do n't want to be `` that health resort in New Mexico where Andy Kaufman died . '' I 'm going to have to ask you to leave . Zmuda is speechless .
ANDY: It 's okay , Bob . It was n't really working . We 'll find something better .
LITTLE WENDY: What is this stuff ?
LYNNE: It 's all macrobiotic . Millet , urdock root , kelp Andy says it 'll purify him . Suddenly a SHARP VOICE .
TONY CLIFTON: How 'bout me and you dolls go get some REAL food French fries and a Porterhouse steak !
LYNNE: Andy ?
TONY CLIFTON: I ai n't Andy ! I 'm Tony ! Andy 's sick pick , chick , kick , lick ! The doctor says he 's a goner . But Tony 's built like a mule ! Andy asked me to be his pallbearer ! I 'll do it for him ! I 'm getting stronge and stronger ! Here , watch this !
LYNNE: Stop it ! C'mon , put that down .
TONY CLIFTON: Yeah , you 're right . We better get movin ' . We do n't wan na miss Happy Hour at Kelbos all the Mai Tai 's you can drink for $ 4.99 .
ANDY: I ca n't move my arm .
GEORGE: You 've got good days and bad days . Andy softly sighs .
ANDY: My hair is coming out .
GEORGE: Yeah
ANDY: I 've got an idea for a new TV show for me to star in . It 's called `` Uncle Andy 's Fun House '' it 'll be a Saturday morning thing where I can goof off with the kids . You know , puppets , magic tricks George is choked up . He goes along with it .
GEORGE: I think we can sell that . Silence .
ANDY: Hey thanks for always backin ' me . George clenches Andy 's hand .
GEORGE: Did your doctor say it 's okay fo you to go back to work ?
ANDY: Ehhh , you know those guys . If he had his way , I 'd be stuck in the hospital , running tests all day . And anyway , I 've found a new guy who 's gon na be able to instantly emove the cancer .
GEORGE: Really ?
ANDY: Yeah ! He 's a psychic surgeon in the Philippines , and he 's amazing ! He ubs you and sucks the disease right out ! Andy beams . George stares sadly .
GEORGE: The Philippines ? I dunno Andy he sounds like one of you characters .
ANDY: No this guy 's special . He performs miracles . George does n't know how to respond . Andy looks up pleadingly . ANDY He 's my last chance .
GEORGE: It 's a perfect Kaufman audience .
ZMUDA: Yeah . They do n't know whether to be sad , or angry . The Taxi cast are flustered .
CAROL KANE: Why are people leaving ? The curtain 's gon na open . Andy 's gon na come out I know it !

LEWIE: Spruance , would you like to show me where it 's marked smearing here because I swear , I do n't see it .
JOAN: Sorry . I did n't know I was .
LEWIE: Also , I 'd be mildly content if I could have a little less delirious self-appreciation and some small egard for remaining somewhere in the vicinity of the goddamned note .
JOAN: I was n't smearing .
HELEN: Sssh , come on now .
JOAN: No , I 'm telling you , this is personally motivated . Since I moved out he 's been doing this , making remarks and being
LEWIE: Now , if our lovely soprano would like to stop grumbling for a moment , I 'd like to take it once again .
JOAN: See what I mean ?
LEWIE: Pardon me ?
JOAN: I said fine , let 's do it again .
LEWIE: From the beginning please .
ADELE: He never says , 'Honey I love you , you 're doing a great job . ' I do n't feel he respects me as a person and I 'm just not that happy with the stature of ou elationship .
THERAPIST: Now I want you to look at Harry and tell him how you feel .
ADELE: I feel like he 's not plugged into my needs , and I 'm not getting enough positive feedback
THERAPIST: Well , let 's see what he wants to say here . Harry , how do you feel when she brings out this material ?
HARRY: How do I feel ? I feel she just overheats on every little side issue , and when I go to try and communicate with the woman , fo some unknown reason she does n't elieve a damn thing I say .
ADELE: Oh that 's a lie .
HARRY: See what I mean ?
ADELE: No , you know what this whole thing hinges from ? He came to rent a uilding from me which is now his place of business
HARRY: So what , he 's not interested in that , that 's not what he 's asking . See what she does ? She wants to dig up and haul out miscellaneous things that 's got nothing to do with this . I mean , I agreed to come here , okay , but I have to tell you , Iwo Jima 's got a lot of faulty notions in her head about me that .
ADELE: Alright , there . Right now . That 's another thing I want to interject
HARRY: Pardon me , I was making a statement here .
THERAPIST: Yes , let 's try and hear each othe out if we can . Go on , Harry .
HARRY: Well , I forgot the upshot of what I was saying , but
ADELE: Okay , this syndrome where I 've asked him to address me by my given name and he just goes on ignoring my wishes .
THERAPIST: Alright . Look at him and really tell him how you feel about that .
ADELE: I do n't want you to ever call me Iwo Jima again !
THERAPIST: That 's a legitimate request , is n't it ? Harry begrudges a slight nod .
ADELE: If you ca n't call me Adele , do n't call me anything at all .
THERAPIST: So ? Can you look at Iwo Jima , Harry , and tell her She darts a confused frown at the Therapist .
ADELE: Next time I want to bring out some of our sexual hot spots .
HARRY: The hell you are , honey .
ADELE: The hell I 'm not .
HARRY: at fifty bucks a shot , out a my pocket I 'm going to listen to some pencil-necked butthead tell me I do n't know how to relate to you
ADELE: Daddy , do you want this marriage to work or not .
HARRY: I hear you , honey . But let 's have just a little more trust on you end of this thing , okay ? That 's all I ask . Get in .
MELVENOS: You sure nothing of value has been emoved from the dwelling ?
JOAN: No , nothing . That 's what 's so disturbing . I mean , why would someone do something like this ?
JOAN: What do you mean , somebody does n't like me ? The Fingerprinter interrupts
MELVENOS: Check out the bedroom .
JOAN: You think this is someone I know ?
MELVENOS: Let 's explore that . Have you had any recent trouble with anyone ?
JOAN: No .
MELVENOS: Anyone whose displeasure you might 've incurred in some way ?
JOAN: Who could it be ?
MELVENOS: You 're not married , I take it .
HELEN: She 's in the process of a divorce .
MELVENOS: What about him ?
HELEN: What about him ? He 's ou conductor , he 's an artist and not someone who 'd ever
JOAN: You mean Lewie ? He 'd never do anything like this .
MELVENOS: You never know .
ANDY: Hi , Joanie
JOAN: Oh great .
ANDY: I just got in from Hawaii and thought I 'd drop by for a minute . What the heck happened in here ?
JOAN: Excuse me , it 's my sister
MELVENOS: Uhm hmm .
JOAN: Andy , this is not the most opportune time . I happen to have had a burglary in here last night
ANDY: Oh really ? That 's awful .
JOAN: So could I just call you later ?
ANDY: Well , ca n't you give me one minute ? I 'd like to know if you got the manuscript I sent you . Who 's that ?
JOAN: Helen Dextra , you 've met he efore .
ANDY: Oh , I have ? Anyway , did you read it ?
JOAN: Read what ? I do n't know what you 're talking about .
ANDY: I 'm talking about the book I 've written about Red and me , that I sent you a copy of , is that so hard to follow ?
JOAN: Oh no . You 've written a book about Red Layls .
ANDY: Not just about him , Joanie , he 's only one of many episodes in my life , you know that . Have you got a Perrier ?
JOAN: No , I do n't . Let me just call you at home later .
ANDY: I 'm not going to be home . I 'm checking into a hospital to have a bone spur removed from my foot . Then I 'm going to New York , to meet with a top publisher which , incidentally , I would not care for Mr. Redmon , fecal- face Layls to know .
JOAN: Wait , I need to talk to you
MELVENOS: I might put some bars on the windows . My name 's Melveny , if you want to get in touch .
JOAN: Really though , I do n't see how this could be somebody I know .
MELVENOS: Maybe not .
JOAN: Because I actually go miles out of my way to avoid conflictual situations .
ANDY: And to top it off , my lawyer said , 'Do n't worry , they 're just pissing into the wind '
JOAN: Andy , are you telling me the truth ?
ANDY: Yes , he 's afraid , they 're all afraid , they 're all off skiing .

ANDY: Wait , I just want you to hear what this colosal shit said about me , through his great white shark of a lawyer .
JOAN: Pardon me , but I do n't care what
ANDY: Fine , why do n't you take my house then ? Joan sinks down into a chair , exhausted
JOAN: Thank you .

JUNE: Well , I 'm not .
HARRY: That 's not the point I 'm making .
JUNE: So ? I 'm sick of dog turds anyway . He scowls at her , then looks out the window
HARRY: Jesus , here I am , sitting in the center of a lot of wealth , the escalation in crime could n't be etter , and I 'm not turning a damn nickel on it

HARRY: Duke , platz ! Always the name first , and then the command .
HARRY: Now , in regard to any aggresso seeking to give you a bad time , I want to show you what you can expect from a dog of this caliber .
JOAN: Oh god , what if I do n't want him to do that ?
HARRY: You want him to do that .
JOAN: No , I just want him to scare someone .
HARRY: Believe me , this will scare them , as well as incapacitate their mind and any ability to maneuve against you .
JOAN: You know , I have an extremely sensitive reaction to dog dander , so maybe I should n't
HARRY: Let me ask you something . I like to get a general picture of the individual situation I 'm working with .
JOAN: I 'm in the process of a divorce and I moved up here because my apartment was burglarized and But I 'm not entirely alone , there 's a housekeeper here , and several friends .
HARRY: Well , the hills are hit heaven as far as burglaries go . And right up on Mulholland is where they found the fifth victim of the Westside Slasher
JOAN: No , please , do n't tell me about that .
HARRY: Believe me , I know what you 're up against , being an attractive , and I take it , unattached woman , such as you are But we 're going to remedy that situation right now , and get you to feeling as safe as a little aby , alright ? What 've we got there so far ?

JOAN: It 's not mine , it 's my sister 's .
HARRY: Oh , it 's your sister 's . And where 's she ?

JUNE: Soak this . As he opens the back panel
HARRY: Start to pattern yourself . Breed up . Observe the woman , for Christ sakes .
JUNE: Oh screw her .
HARRY: You do n't screw this type of individual .
JUNE: You would . On his way to the driver 's door
HARRY: This is the kind of atmosphere we want to gravitate toward . Did she even ask me the cost ? Dammit , I really respect that .
ON JUNE: grumbling as she moves to the passenger door
JUNE: Well I do n't , he is n't even you dog .
MAN: How about a little smile .
LEWIE: This is supposed to sound virginal , ladies , so let 's try to fake it .
JOAN: Do n't do that .
EDDY: Do n't do what ?
JOAN: You 're not supposed to look him straight in the eye .
EDDY: You have a dog you ca n't look in the eye , Joan ?
JOAN: He 's not just a dog . He 's a Schutzhund trained attack dog .
EDDY: Oh
JOAN: I was told to avoid a direct gaze and always look at the base of the ight or the left ear .
EDDY: You do n't have to go to all this trouble , I 've offered to stay up at your sister 's with you ?
JOAN: I ca n't tell you how mad I am at Lewie , that I have to leave him out here , tied to a tree
EDDY: God , you 're stubborn , Joan .
JOAN: I 'm not stubborn , I 'm so accommodating , it 's sickening . She pats Duke on the head and stands up
EDDY: But you wo n't tell me what 's eally bothering you . Why do n't you confide in me anymore ?
JOAN: I do .
EDDY: No you do n't . Come on , talk to me . Let 's go have a drink afte ehearsal .

JOAN: I do n't know . Let 's say maybe .
EDDY: Well do n't go out of your way , Joan .
JOAN: Eddy ? Tomorrow 's fine . Okay ?
JOAN: I knew it . I should n't have moved here .
JOAN: I do n't know what to do . Maybe I should move into a motel .
HARRY: No , you do n't have to do that . This is just some ding-dong that 's trying to scare you .
JOAN: Well he 's succeeded . She sits down .
HARRY: But you do n't want to give off that impression , by acting too timid or afraid , because that 's what invites an aggressive attitude from certain types of
HARRY: Well , let 's see . Just walk back and forth the way you normally do .
JOAN: Well I do n't normally walk back and forth , but okay . She attempts a few steps then stops abruptly
HARRY: Okay , but keep in mind that you want to exhibit a very confident attitude . Look like you know what you 're doing and where you 're going .
JOAN: Uhm-hmm .
HARRY: Just remember to stop short of appearing a little dykey , because that 's not attractive .
JOAN: But I thought that 's your point , no to attract
HARRY: No , no , you always want to remain a little bit attractive . Otherwise that can set somone off too .
JOAN: This is just impossible . She moves back to the couch and sits down .
HARRY: Sure you can , it 's just a matte of degree .
JOAN: Well darn it , I give up Dropping her head into her hands .
HARRY: Uh-oh . Now what 's this ?
JOAN: I 'm sorry but this is really getting to me . He sits down next to her
HARRY: Tell you what . Let me take you
JOAN: That 's very sweet of you , Harry . I 'd like to do that .
HARRY: Oh , I 'd say seven or eight years , around there .
JOAN: And so you like , well , assuming
HARRY: I have to tell you the truth I 've been observing your hands , and I have to use the word exquisite .
JOAN: Really ? Well
HARRY: You 're probably quite a singer too . I 'd like to come down and catch you sometime .
JOAN: Yes , anytime . Do you like Classical music ?
HARRY: Very much . Even to the degree that when it 's playing on the adio , I sometimes have to turn the damn thing off .
JOAN: I 'm sorry . I should n't have laughed .
HARRY: Yeah , symphonies , operettas , poems , things like that . All those type of things really get to me .
JOAN: Uhm hmm .
JOAN: You 're full of surprises , Harry , you know that ? That you 've actually read Dante 's Divine Comedy I mean
HARRY: Well , it was a while back there that I did , yeah
JOAN: You know that part ? 'Yet as a wheel moves smoothly , free from jars , My will and my desire were turned by love , The love that moves the sun and other stars . '
HARRY: It depends on the man and woman you 're talking about .
JOAN: What a tragedy that sex is often such a barrier to friendship etween men and women .
HARRY: There I disagree with you .
JOAN: You know Dante and Beatrice neve slept together .
HARRY: Is that right ? Oh yeah , I forgot that part .
JOAN: Well , anyway I should n't have had so much wine because I prefer to go a little slow here .
HARRY: We can go as slow as you want why not ?
JOAN: So You think men and women can be friends ?
HARRY: Oh yeah , absolutely .
JOAN: Alright now , do n't play too rough .
HELEN: Number one , I 've known the man fo fifteen years , number two , he loves you .
HELEN: 'Always trying to connect with me , proposing private rehearsals at his apartment . ' You know what he asked me yesterday ?
JOAN: My piano tuner .
HELEN: Is he weird or something ?
HELEN: I think it 's him , the tree surgeon . He sounds very suspicious
JOAN: Just do n't tell Lewie about the phone message or the thing I got in the mail , because he 'll just use it to
HELEN: I already did .
JOAN: Helen .
LEWIE: I 'm extremely concerned about this situation . I do n't want you living alone up there .
JOAN: No , I would n't feel comfortable about doing that .
LEWIE: Come here
JOAN: Darn it , Lewie .
LEWIE: What ? Are you afraid of you esponses to me ?
JOAN: Tch
LEWIE: Why are you resisting ?
JOAN: These are very upsetting , really shitty circumstances I 'm dealing with and I
LEWIE: Do you know how hard all this has een on me ? Do you think it 's that easy for me to admit I want you back ?
JOAN: Could n't you spare yourself then ?
LEWIE: Are you seeing anybody ? Just tell me that . She rolls her eyes , sighing impatiently .
JOAN: Please , do n't judge me by you scrotal excesses , Lewie .
LEWIE: I know you 're seeing somebody .
JOAN: Are you spying on me ?
LEWIE: Come on . Be open about it . Who is it ?
JOAN: Alright , I am seeing someone , okay ? He pulls back , narrowing his eyes at her
LEWIE: I do n't believe you . Who is it ?
JOAN: You know , I hate to mention this ut we 're having a slight problem with Duke .
HARRY: What ?
JOAN: Well He keeps getting up and trying to ide on one 's extremities .
HARRY: Oh do n't worry about that .
JOAN: Especially Socorro , who ca n't speak English , let alone German , and sometimes she has to go pulling him from room to room like a vacuum cleaner .
HARRY: No , that 's just normal in most of your adult males . Some percentage of the time they 're gon na attempt to make these vulgar motions on your person . He places his arm on the couch behind her
JOAN: It 's not affecting you too much , is it ?
HARRY: No , it 's very nice .
JOAN: It 's Chopin , a nocturne .
HARRY: You know what 's affecting me ?
JOAN: Night-piece , it means .
HARRY: You are .
JOAN: I think I should say something .
HARRY: Do n't worry about it .
JOAN: That 's the problem though , I want to be honest with you
HARRY: There 's no problem .
JOAN: Because I recently realized something about myself . That I 've slept with a number of men in my life just because I did n't want them not to like me .
HARRY: Uhm hmm .
JOAN: But the thing is , I did n't like most of them that much , so why did I care whether they liked me o not ?
HARRY: You know , I 'm not one of these guys who 's going to look upon you as an object .
JOAN: Oh , I know , that 's not what I 'm saying
HARRY: Because I look upon a woman as a whole .
JOAN: What I 'm saying is I do n't know if ight now I might not go to bed with you because I do n't want to e alone , so I thought maybe we could try to explore other modes , or
HARRY: Other modes ?
JOAN: I mean , there are other ways of eing intimate , that people do n't even realize .
HARRY: Uhm hmm .
JOAN: Which does n't mean I 'm not attracted to you .
HARRY: Other modes is fine . You do n't have to be shy with me . I 've been asked to do do every kind of thing in the book .
JOAN: God , it 's so hard to pioneer in this area when you keep doing that
ANDY: There 's no phone in my room , o cable TV . I 've had to sneak into this cell next to me , with some poor lithium zombie lying here like a comatose cabbage
JOAN: Maybe I better take this .
ANDY: Oh you 're there . Thank God .
JOAN: Where are you ? Are you in New York ?
ANDY: No , that 's what I 'm telling you . I went into the hospital first , for one day , just to have a simple one spur
JOAN: I know , you told me that , but where are you now ?
ANDY: and the next thing I know I 'm transported some place the hell else , against my knowledge , while I was completely medicated
JOAN: Andy , wait a minute
ANDY: Do you understand the implications of this , I have no underpants on , and absolutely no recourse to my ights !
JOAN: Oh God , this is because of Red , is n't it ?
ANDY: Yes , it 's because of Red , is n't that obvious ! ?
JOAN: What am I supposed to do ?
HARRY: Find out where she is .
JOAN: Hello ? Andy ? You have to tell me where you are .
ANDY: I told you , I do n't know where I am , these bastards are very clever .
HARRY: Tell her we 'll find it .
JOAN: We 'll find it , okay , so do n't worry
HARRY: No .
HARRY: Let 's just take a run out there .
JOAN: You mean right now ?
HARRY: Well the guy must be doing something right to have amassed that amount of wealth .
JOAN: But she does this , you know , she just periodically drops the entire weight of her life on me like a ton of bricks .
HARRY: Joan , can I make a suggestion ?
JOAN: Yes , please , anything .
HARRY: You better try an keep up a little with the flow or we 're gon na get cited .
JOAN: How do you know he was he physician ?
HARRY: Hell , I could come in here and say I was a doctor an ' sign somebody out .
JOAN: And even if he was a doctor , it does n't mean he was my sister 's doctor .
HARRY: Okay , let 's stop wasting time here , where is this guy , what 's his name ?
JOAN: I ca n't believe this , you mean there 's no phone number o address ?
HARRY: What kind of business are you unning here , buddy ?
JOAN: How am I supposed to find this man ? Maybe he used a false name , or maybe he is n't even a doctor
HARRY: I 've got a couple of ideas here . First , we want to try an ' connect with Red Layls .
JOAN: No , I do n't want anything to do with Red , I 'm terrified of him .
HARRY: There 's nothing to be afraid of , elieve me .
JOAN: I mean , you hear all kinds of things , about government kickbacks , and Panamanian drug couriers and
HARRY: I know these type of guys . You take away their money and thei power , and what are they .
JOAN: No , really , I have to do something . I have to go to the police
HARRY: Just hold off a bit on that , honey , will you ?
JOAN: Oh , that 's nice .
HARRY: What ?
JOAN: You called me honey .
HARRY: Well that 's what you are .
JOAN: Harry , this is n't your problem and
HARRY: Do n't worry , we 're going to find your sister . Everything 's going to turn out fine .
VITA: Okay , go ahead , I 've got ta hea this . Who is it this time ?
HARRY: No , it 's not what you think . This is a very unique individual I 'm talking about . Plus there 's a mind there , as well as a body and a face .
HARRY: I 'm telling you , this is something completely different . You got ta
VITA: Oh . Fred , you mean ?
HARRY: Yeah , that 's him . How do you think I could get a hold of him ?
VITA: Oh gee , I think he 's moved out of
MONCRIEF: Mr. Bliss , I 'd like to have word with you , if I may .
HARRY: You 're talking to the wrong godammed party , you know that ?
MONCRIEF: I think it 's in your best interest to hear me out .
HARRY: No , you hear me out , friend
MONCRIEF: Well I do n't want to appear to be taking unfair advantage of you
HARRY: Goddamned right .
MONCRIEF: But in developing certain information on you , it 's come to our attention that your name is n't Harry Bliss . That in fact , you name is Eugene Earl Axline
HARRY: Wait a minute .
MONCRIEF: And that both the I.R.S. , and an impressive number of creditors in several Eastern cities seem to be somewhat interested in your whereabouts .
HARRY: You know , that 's not necessarily entirely accurate , I mean , I do n't know where you come up with these so-called facts , but I ca n't go sneaking around , stealing this lady 's property .
MONCRIEF: I 'd like to pose that the name and reputation of this very decent man , is not the property
MONCRIEF: And it 's my hope that we can avoid any unpleasant eventualities , either for you , or for someone you have such admirable feelings toward
HARRY: What do you mean , 'unpleasant ' ?
MONCRIEF: I mean that Mr. Layls is prepared to do whatever it takes to confiscate this document . And if
HARRY: Jesus Christ , I hardly know the woman . I 'm just renting a dog to her , that 's all . What kind of a person do you take me for ?
JOAN: Oh , Socorro
SOCORRO: No . No es mi .
JOAN: La manuscripto de mi hermana , Andy , si ? I go toda la casa Everywhere Looking y looking And no es anywhere . Sabe usted ? Socorro smiles apologetically
SOCORRO: No se , no entiendo Lo siento
JOAN: I told this detective I wanted to press charges against Red Layls , for abducting Andy , fo urglarizing my apartment , fo eaking into her house
HARRY: Oh come on , you 're way off .
JOAN: And that he 's been trying to scare and intimidate me in case I might have read something in he manuscript that he does n't want anybody to know . And you know what he said ? That I have n't given him probable cause to even go and question Red Layls , or his lawyer
HARRY: Well , he 's right , I could 've told you that . This is a man who goes fishing with the President , honey . He 's a little high up to go around urglarizing people and sending them nasty notes . So why do n't you just ease back on this thing for awhile Life 's too godammed short .
JOAN: I ca n't do that , Harry . This is my sister . I can at least make out a missing persons report on her , and then I want to talk to the private detective friend of yours .
HARRY: I 'm trying to chase the guy down , okay ? But do n't go and make yourself sick
JOAN: You mean to Red ?
HARRY: Yeah , to Red , or whoever
JOAN: Well if I ever find , it , that 's the last thing I 'd do with it .
HARRY: Dammit , you 're making my work more difficult for me , you know that !
JOAN: What is this , have I come at the wrong time or something ?
HARRY: I tell you what the hell to do and you do n't listen to me !
JOAN: Well , someone abates you maidenhood and suddenly feels they can start ordering you around .
HARRY: I 'm not ordering you around . I 'm just giving you my opinion . And maybe I get tired of hearing about this stuff all the time , this book usiness , this manu-whatever , and Red Layls , and your sister .
JOAN: Oh . Well I 'm sorry if I 've overtaxed you with my problems , Harry , but I never asked you to consider them a part of your work . So why do n't we speak when you 're in a better frame of mind . As she crosss to the door , Harry stands up
HARRY: Ah honey , now
JOAN: Aw honey yourself .
JOAN: Oh , Socorro , please-keep-the-dog el perro , in in piso inferior , por favor exercise oom Tiene allergy
SOCORRO: Ah , si . Duke , venga aqui .
JOAN: Come on , let me drive you home .
HARRY: What 's her problem .
HARRY: I come over here to look at the ball game and you give me these clowns .
JUNE: You want a know something ?
HARRY: They do n't want to hear the truth , that 's what disturbs me .
JUNE: There 's some people that do n't treat me like you do .
HARRY: You tell them the truth and they come at you with a cleaver .
JUNE: I know one guy that says very complimentary things to me , like that I have nice features and a
HARRY: What guy ?
JUNE: Some guy I met , that likes me .
HARRY: You 're going to leave me , lard , just after I 've broken you in , and taught you the fine art of dog training ?
JUNE: Maybe .
HARRY: Women . What 's the score ?
JOAN: Helen , quick , get in the car ! Helen leans down and looks in at her
HELEN: What ?
JOAN: Helen ! Help me !
HELEN: I ca n't ! I ca n't move ! !
HARRY: Why did n't you have the damn dog with you , that 's what he 's for !
JOAN: I told you , he was in the house .
HARRY: What the hell good is that ! You have to have him with you at all times !
JOAN: No you did n't , I said he was dangerous , and you said he was n't
HARRY: Yeah , but that 's before he tried to part your hair with an axe !
JOAN: I do n't know if it was him . Maybe it was this tree surgeon
HARRY: Wait a minute . How tall was he ? About six one ? Kind of ugly ?
HELEN: He was about your height .
JOAN: No , he was n't , he was much taller .
HELEN: Well let 's not quibble , for god sakes . The man is a complete maniac And excuse me for saying , but this is n't a job for an amateur
JOAN: But wait , he could n't be the same man who burglarized my apartment , ecause that 's before I came up here
HARRY: Forget about him . I know what I 'm talking about
HARRY: Guy like Red Layls have hit men working for them , that drive them around and do their dirty work fo them .
JOAN: Gee whiz , first it is n't Red , now it is Red . I ca n't keep up with these sudden reversals .
HELEN: Alright I 'm calling a cab .
JOAN: You know what I think ? It 's more than one person .
HARRY: It 's not more than one person . I 'm telling you who the hell it is !
JOAN: It does n't seem like something he 'd do .
HARRY: Dammit , Joan ! !
JOAN: God , what is this ? ! I ca n't say anything to you anymore , you 're so darn touchy !
JOAN: It 's Andy 's
HARRY: It 's very becoming on you .
JOAN: Maybe I do n't quite fill it out .
HARRY: Yes you do . After a brief moment
JOAN: Well ? He remains seated , looking at her .
JOAN: What are you going to do now ? Are you going to leave ?
HARRY: Yeah , I 'm going to skip down the hill , take care of a few things , pick up some clothes
JOAN: Could you be back for dinner , around 7 00 ?
HARRY: Yeah . Sure .
JOAN: Good .
HARRY: Hi .

HARRY: I just want to look for my watch , I think I left it in there .
SOCORRO: Ah si , es okay . She steps out of the way to let him in .
HARRY: Thanks , Soco .
ADELE: Harry ! What the hell do you think you 're doing ?
HARRY: I just got a phone call , honey , from a prominent entertainer up in Vegas , a very well-known singer
ADELE: Who is it , Paul Anka ?
HARRY: He 's a rock star , you probably would n't know the name . Anyway , I got ta run a couple a dogs up to him
ADELE: You know , it 's T-minus zero and counting , Harry , on this whole shitty deal .
HARRY: Now Iwo , do n't blow this way out of proportion . You think I want to do this . I need the extra cash ight now , believe me .

HARRY: No . Nothing 's wrong . Everything 's fine .
JOAN: You 're probably wondering why I 'm smiling . He looks over at her
HARRY: What ?
JOAN: I was just thinking that I find this moody side of you very attractive .
HARRY: Oh , uh-huh .
JOAN: In fact , if you want to know , and I can see you 're dying to I completely adore you .
HARRY: Well , same here , honey .
JOAN: Why are you all wet ?
HARRY: You know , there is something I feel I got ta say here , Joan , that 's been preying on my mind . Something I maybe should 've handled a bit differently with you from the start , about this particular situation I 'm in
JOAN: What situation ?
HARRY: Well , you recall I mentioned to you a while back , that I was finished
SOCORRO: Mira , alli estoy .
MONCRIEF: I have no knowledge whatsoever of Mrs. Ellerman 's so-called book , o her alleged disappearance , which appears to have all the ear marks of a publicity stunt .
JOAN: Can you believe this ? !
HARRY: This is not the way you want to go about this , honey .
JOAN: First you tell me I go around acting too timid
HARRY: Yeah , but this is a whole different situation here
JOAN: And now when I suddenly feel like I could save the Pope in an earthquake , you start trying to
HARRY: This is not the Pope we 're talking about here , believe me .
JOAN: That 's just a figure of speech . They disappear out the front door .
HARRY: Dammit , Joan , these people are holding all the cards . They 'll probably throw you into that ughouse with your sister .
HARRY: Alright .
JOAN: Will you stop trying to undermine me every inch of the way .
JOAN: Anyway , I did n't ask you to drag along with me .
HARRY: You 're the one that 's dragging along .
JOAN: Do n't tell me what to do .
HARRY: Okay , just let me drive the goddamned car , that 's all I ask .
JOAN: Why should I let you drive ?
HARRY: Why ? I 'll tell you why , because you 're a terrible driver , that 's why .
JOAN: Oh , now all the ugly little truths are coming out .
HARRY: You operate this vehicle like it was a cane with a red tip painted on the end of it .
JOAN: Do n't talk to me , Harry . I mean it , just do n't say another word to me !
HARRY: Driving around with a goddamned ax stuck in your car
JOAN: And now look at me . I 've got purpose tremors
HARRY: Is something the fuck bothering you , pal ? He gets into the Mercedes and slams the door .
JOAN: No .
HARRY: Good . Just barge into the place , honey , and play the big hero . When he tells you your sister 's not there , what 're you going to do , cry ?
JOAN: Okay . What ?
HARRY: Excuse me , Nurse
JOAN: I hope you know what you 're doing .
HARRY: Do n't worry . Just do what I told you .
HARRY: What 's the problem , dear ?
HARRY: I understand . You 're doing you job .
NURSE ONE: Where did your assistant ?
HARRY: She had to step inside for a moment , to relieve herself .
ANDY: And if this little kinglet of corporate shit thinks he can get away with this , he 's greatly mistaken . Just wait 'til he hears what I 'm going to come out with now . Joan thrusts her skirt at Andy
JOAN: Put this on .
ANDY: Remember when he passed me off as staff and I was put on official government payroll all through Maui and the Yucatan Mission ?
JOAN: No , I do n't . And hurry up , will you .
ANDY: Yes you do , remember , when I almost died of the vomito negro ? Well that 's when he was doing all that illegal oil drilling off the Mexican Gulf
NURSE ONE: I assume you 're a fairly recent associate of the doctor 's ?
HARRY: That 's very correct .
NURSE ONE: Uhm hmmm What do you specialize in ?
HARRY: I 'd say female troubles , mainly .
NURSE ONE: Oh , so Dr. Park feels there 's a gynecological involvement here .
HARRY: Sometimes he does , yes . By the way , did anyone ever tell you what attractive eyebrows you have ?
NURSE ONE: Oh , well , no , they have n't
JOAN: What about her hair ?
ANDY: Who 's he ?
NURSE ONE: That was my superior . She tells me Dr. Park is in surgery and she suggests that you wait in the Administrative Lounge until we can get a hold of him . Would that be alright ?
HARRY: Certainly .
NURSE ONE: That way , Doctor , and thank you very much for your patience .
HARRY: Do n't mention it .
ANDY: And this man , who would n't know the truth if it came up and spit him in the eye , is accusing me of lying
HARRY: Here , put this on .
ANDY: I mean , the arrogance What did she say your name was ?
HARRY: Harry .
ANDY: Have you got a cigarette , Harry ?
HARRY: Stay in the car . Do n't talk to anybody , and I 'll be right back .
JOAN: Christ .
HARRY: Is that you ?
JOAN: Yes , it 's me . Hurry up , will you !
HARRY: I 'm having a little trouble getting ack in .
JOAN: Oh great , Harry . What have you got me into ?
HARRY: Everything 's under control , just hang on a few more minutes and I 'll be right back , okay ?
MONCRIEF: Andy ? It 's Larry Moncrief .
MONCRIEF: Would you care to sit up for a minute ? I 'd like to talk to you .
ANDY: You son of a bitch !
RED: Who is it ?
ANDY: Who the hell do you think it is ? !
RED: Sweetheart ? Is that you ? She pulls the dark glasses off
ANDY: No thanks to you , it 's me . and throws them onto the dashboard .
HARRY: Aw , Jesus .
MONCRIEF: Before he arrives , I 'd like you to take a look at a list of certain deletions and expurgations , which if agreed to
JOAN: Andy 's not here .
MONCRIEF: I can see that , Miss Spruance . Would you care to tell me where she is ?
JOAN: As a matter of fact , she happens to be on her way to the police ight now , accompanied by a close friend of mine Her bluff is immediately belied by
MONCRIEF: Sturge .
HARRY: Shit .
JOAN: Just go get Andy and leave , will you !
HARRY: That 's what I 'm trying to tell you
MONCRIEF: I 'm a little disappointed to find you defaulting on our agreement .
JOAN: What agreement ?
HARRY: Bullshit ! I never agreed to anything ! This asshole approached me and tried to bribe me into working fo them , and I told him to go to hell !
MONCRIEF: I believe an agreement was implicit in your acceptance of my check .
HARRY: Oh , you want to see your check ?
HARRY: Honey , do n't go by anything this guy says , because I 'm the only one who knows what the hell I 'm doing . It just slipped my mind , I was going to tell you . See ? I never cashed the fucking thing !
JOAN: Are you alright ? And in response to Andy 's stoical nod
ANDY: I need a Kleenex .
JOAN: You know what they 're trying to do , do n't you ? To force you into signing some kind of agreement that
ANDY: Wait , I want to tell you what he said to me
JOAN: What ? !
ANDY: And when he said it he had a tear in his eye Joan 's jaw goes slack in disbelief .
MONCRIEF: Well this moves to the top of the list , Red , as one of your more stunning achievements .
RED: Get me something cold to drink , will you ?
MONCRIEF: Certainly .
JOAN: Andy , you do n't know what you 're saying . You 're suffering from hostage syndrome or something .
ANDY: Well , after all I do love him .
JOAN: You 'love ' him ? !
ANDY: Yes , he 's been a very important man in my life , you know that .
JOAN: Oh , now he 's not a fecal-faced , great white shark !
ANDY: I do n't know where she got that . Will you please keep your voice down . He 's very sensitive to what people say .
JOAN: 'Sensitive ' ? Have you lost all your beads ? ! This man had you kidnapped and kept in a drugged stupor for the last three weeks , and now he 's
HARRY: Alright , what the hell 's going on in here ?
RED: Who 's this ?
MONCRIEF: That 's the dog trainer .
RED: I thought he was working for us .
MONCRIEF: Well there seems to be a little grey area there , Red .
RED: Come over here , I want to talk to you .
HARRY: Mr. Layls
JOAN: Will you listen to me ! This man is not only a bastard , he 's a scummy , soul-less little thug and a criminal !
ANDY: Are you implying that I have defective judgement in men , Joanie ?
HARRY: I just want a say , that though you 're someone in a category I admire , you 've gone to some lengths on this thing here , that I do n't entirely agree with
RED: Sit down . I have a neck condition and it aggravates me to have to look up at you .
HARRY: Okay . No problem .
RED: You know , I 'm not in the best of health right now , and I 've been advised to avoid excitement Harry takes a second glass from Moncrief
HARRY: Oh , uh huh .
RED: More sugar .
JOAN: And furthermore , this 'sensitive ' man 's lawyer more than implied they were willing to put your feet , as well as probably mine , into a lock of cement !
ANDY: Oh that 's just all talk Would somebody please get me my clothes !
RED: Just put yourself , Harry , for a moment , in the shoes of a man whose sole intention is to leave the world a better place than he found it , only to discover those intentions have been painfully slandered by someone he 'd given oth his heart and his economic support to , not to mention his trust
HARRY: Uhm-hmm .
JOAN: Harry , I ca n't believe you 're sitting there nodding your head and having a tea party with these crooks !
HARRY: I 'm not nodding my head , honey , I 'm just listening to the man .
ANDY: Who is this guy , anyway ? Is n't he a little sleazy , Joanie , a bit infra dig ? I mean Lewie 's a bit of a stiff , but
JOAN: You 're going to talk to me about sleaze , when you consorted with some maniac tree surgeon , who was flicking his tongue out at me like some rutting iguana , and groping at his naturalia at three in the morning ? !
ANDY: Oh , 'him . '
JOAN: Oh 'him ' ? ! He came at me with an ax !
ANDY: Well , he 's very immature .
MONCRIEF: Miss Spruance , would you care fo a
JOAN: No , thank you .
ON RED: Raising a baleful eye to Joan
ON JOAN: Standing above Layls
HARRY: Honey , he 's not supposed to get excited .
JOAN: Not only for having my apartment burglarized but fo eaking into Andy 's house , as well as hiring someone to frighten , harass and intimidate me !
HARRY: You know , maybe you better not
JOAN: No , Dammit !
RED: I never much cared for you , young lady . And I find your display of anger both unattractive and unfeminine .
HARRY: Now wait a minute
JOAN: I 'm not here to beg your good opinion
RED: What is it ?
JOAN: I do n't believe you !
RED: And as regards Andy 's house , I 'd have no need to break into Andy 's house , because I own Andy 's house .
JOAN: I do n't care whose house you own ,
ANDY: Will you please stop interfering in my personal life , Joanie . Red lifts the beeper to his mouth again
JOAN: Andy , you know something ?
ANDY: Well if you 're going to take this kind of grumpy attitude , I certainly wo n't .
JOAN: Harry , where are my clothes ?
HARRY: Uh
RED: Will you people be quiet , I ca n't hear this . Go ahead .
RED: Well whose heart is it ? Give me a profile .
JOAN: Would you please get me my clothes . Moncrief steps in beside Joan
MONCRIEF: I wanted to tell you a moment ago , that I was privileged to see you at the Bowl on the Fourth of July
HARRY: So what . I 'm talking to this lady
RED: You ca n't tell me what kind of a woman she was ? ! And if she was so godammed healthy , why is she dead ? !
MONCRIEF: And I was especially moved by you endition of 'The Battle Hymn of The '
HARRY: Never mind that shit . Tell her
MONCRIEF: Well , shall we start with the fact that you 're a married man and then go on from there ?
HARRY: Wait a minute , honey
RED: You know whose heart this body- snatcher is trying to give me ? ! A victim of somebody called the Westside Slasher ! And this is the doctor you recommended to me ! You 're killing me , Monroe ! You know that ? ! You 're pushing me to the goddamned wall !
HARRY: Honey , there 's a simple explanation to all of this , if you want me to go into it I was trying to tell you at dinner She disappears into an intersecting hallway .
RED: What in the hell should I do ? !
ANDY: So let 's just go there , sweetheart , and have him sew the darn thing in .
HARRY: Look , you know , you live a life , honey , you make some mistakes . You get married for maybe mutual enefits , or business considerations weighing on you at the time , and ecause you do n't think the right person is ever going to come along .
JOAN: I would never have knowingly become involved with a married man .
HARRY: I know that , that 's why I was trying to come out and tell you
JOAN: Please , I do n't want to discuss it anymore . I bet you never read Dante , either .
HARRY: Now there you 're 75 percent wrong .
JOAN: I mean , I ca n't believe it , that you 'd lie to me about this
HARRY: Okay , I lied . Did n't you eve tell a lie ? If not let me kiss your high heel .
JOAN: I 'm going in the house .
HARRY: Wait . Can I call you tomorrow , just to see how you 're feeling ? Or how things are going ?
JOAN: I have a dress rehearsal tomorrow and a concert on Friday . That 's all I care about right now .
HARRY: Do n't say that , please . I 'm asking you to just give me the chance to clear up all these things in my life , because
JOAN: No . I did n't extricate myself from the infidelities of one man , just to fall into the arms of the prince of prevaricators
HARRY: Well , I may be all kinds of a son of a bitch , and the prince of whatever , but that does n't mean I would n't , when it comes down to it , stand up and take the bullet for you .
JOAN: That 's not what I observed , Harry . She opens the door and gets out .
HARRY: Hey , Lee , how are you . I just this minute got back from Vegas . I was dealing a couple of dogs to Paul Anka . I was about to give you a call .
LEE: Do n't embarrass us both , man . Just give me the dog back , and let 's preserve the friendship .
HARRY: Lee , I 'm in the neighborhood of getting my hands on the money . I 'm about to close a business deal with Vark Zulethian of Zulethian Carpets , you 've probably heard of him
LEE: Come on , I know these dodges ackwards and forwards . I need the dog . He 's up for a TV series .
HARRY: Look , our agreement was I could uy the dog back . He 's the only thing I got to prove to people what I can do , and all I 'm asking you , Lee , is
LEE: Do n't make me have to get legal with you , Harry . You sold me the animal , then as a personal favor , I let you borrow him , to demo to some V.I.P.. that probably do n't even exist . You have n't been straight with me , man . Just go get the dog .
HARRY: Duke , geh im wagen .
LEE: Why do n't you take this dog , Harry . He 's green , but maybe you could do something with him .
HARRY: No , I do n't want the dog .
LEE: Go ahead , man . Take him . If you do n't want him , pick up some change . Sell him for a pet .
HARRY: Do me one favor , will you ? Say 'owner ' if you want to , but do n't say 'trainer . ' I trained that dog .
LEE: Let me think about that , okay ? He moves past him and OUT OF FRAME .
VITA: What do you want , Harry ?
HARRY: Yeah .
HELEN: A few of us are going to grab a ite . You want to join us ?
JOAN: No , go ahead . I 'm not hungry .
HELEN: Well , who 's going to drive you home ?
JOAN: I 'll call a cab . Eddy steps INTO FRAME
EDDY: I can take her home .
HELEN: Good , because I do n't want you to e alone . Alright ? See you tomorrow .
JOAN: Thank you , Eddy .
JOAN: I hate living here now .
EDDY: And the milkman 's a child molester .
JOAN: Thanks , Eddy . He laughs , then
EDDY: Well , it 's true . It does n't matte where you live . Shit happens .
JOAN: Are you in a bad mood or something ?
EDDY: No . I 'm not in a bad mood . Not as ad as yours .
EDDY: Remember when we were on tour in Japan , in '86 ? She looks over at him .
JOAN: Could you be more specific ?
JOAN: That was witty of me .
EDDY: But you were n't . Because an hou later , you went into Lewie 's room and you did n't come out .
JOAN: Well , if you remember , I was in love with Lewis around that time , which I confided to you , so you did know
EDDY: That 's not the reason .
JOAN: Excuse me , Eddy , you just passed the turn off to my street . No response .
EDDY: Somebody did .
JOAN: Well , am I supposed to guess , o are you going to
EDDY: Because you deserved it .
JOAN: I did n't deserve it . I 've always thought of you and treated you as one of my closest and dearest friends
EDDY: I use to think very highly of you , too , but now I do n't like what I see . In fact , it 's been very disturbing to me , Joan . Very disillusioning . To see that efore you 've even gotten rid of Lewie , you 've started up with some other man .
JOAN: Eddy , I want you to take me home now .
EDDY: You know , there 's so many things about me you have no idea of . You never ask me about my life or what I 'm thinking , because you have no interest
JOAN: Yes I do . You can tell me whateve you want to , but let 's go back down to
EDDY: Creative things , and dreams , and feelings I have , that Lewie o anyone else in your life , are not capable of
JOAN: Eddy
EDDY: You present yourself like you are , ut you 're not Do n't you think I know that , bette than anybody ?
JOAN: What are you doing ?
HARRY: Okay , what is this ! What the hell are you doing with this guy ! He reaches in and pulls Eddy away from Joan .
JOAN: Harry , look out !
HARRY: Jesus Christ
JOAN: Duke , fasse !
JOAN: You bastards ! !
VOICE: What are you people doing down there ?
HARRY: Are you crazy ? ! What are you doing , running around with a guy like this ! !
JOAN: You maniacs ! ! You liars ! ! You shits ! !
HARRY: What are you yelling at me for ? ! This son of a bitch is probably the Westside Slasher !
MAN: It looks like a domestic quarrel . Let 's get a car up here quick .
JOAN: I 'm finished wagging my tail and leaving little puddles on the floor ! !
HARRY: Wait a minute , honey
JOAN: And smiling on command , because I do n't give a damn whether any of you like me or not ! ! !
VOICE: Are you alright , ma'am ?
HARRY: Yeah , she 's alright ! ! I 've got him ! ! The Westside Slasher , I got him ! !
JOAN: He 's not the Westside Slasher ! !
HARRY: A friend of yours ! This guy 's a friend of yours ? !
JOAN: None of you are friends of mine , you fucker ! !
VOICE: Ma'am , is this guy bothering you ?
HARRY: Look , you assholes ! The guy was holding a knife at her throat ! !
VOICE: Okay , put the knife down , fellow . Then to Joan again , taking a step toward her
HARRY: What were you doing , kissing this guy ! ?
JOAN: I was n't kissing him ! !
VOICE: Stand where you are , and put down the knife .
ON JOAN: Perceiving the danger to Harry
JOAN: Put the knife down , Harry !
HARRY: Why do n't you go harass someone else ! !
JOAN: Give me that thing .
VOICE: Do n't touch her , buddy .
HARRY: But that 's what I am , honey , you friend , that 's what I wanted to tell you , and then I saw you with this guy
VOICE: Do n't worry , lady , we 've got a ca on the way .
JOAN: Will you please shut up and go away ! ! This is private ! Ca n't you see that ! ?
HARRY: I just wanted to tell you , because you do n't know , how important you are to me
VOICE: Step away from him , ma'am .
HARRY: And I needed you to know this one other thing about me , because I do n't want to withhold anything from you anymore
JOAN: Oh God , I do n't want to know , Harry . What is it ?
HARRY: My real name 's not Harry . It 's Eugene .
JOAN: Oh . 'Eugene . ' I love that name .

BEN: Hank !
HANK: table .
JO: This is n't really Africa , Hank . It 's French Morocco .
BEN: Northern Africa .
HANK: Still seems like Las Vegas .
BEN: We 're only a hundred miles north of the Sahara Desert !
HANK: I dunno . In school they called it the Dark Continent . It 's twice as bright as Indianapolis ! Jo and Ban smile at Hank .
BEN: Just wait till you see Marrakesh .
HANK: Marrakesh . Sounds like a drink . Ben runs his tongue across his lips .
BEN: You bet it does .
LOUIS: Pardon me .
BEN: I 'd like to thank you . Without you help , anything might have happened .
LOUIS: A pleasure , monsieur . There are moments in life when we all need a little help .
BEN: May I introduce my wife , Mrs. McKenna . Louis turns pleasantly to Jo .
LOUIS: How do you do , madame . My name is Louis Bernard . She returns his smile .
JO: Thank you , Mr. Bernard .
BEN: And this is our son , Hank .
LOUIS: Hallo , Hank . He holds out his hand to Hank , who takes it .
HANK: You talk Arab talk .
LOUIS: A few words .
JO: Why was he so angry ? It was an accident .
LOUIS: The Moslem religion allows for few accidents . May I be permitted to sit down ?
BEN: Oh , sure , sure . 0f course . Next to Jo , there .
LOUIS: I thought his name was Hank .
BEN: Oh , uh
LOUIS: How different .
BEN: For Josephine . Called her Jo so long , nobody knows her by any other name .
HANK: I do . Mummy .
LOUIS: Now about the `` accident . '' You see , a Moslem woman never takes off her veil in public under any circumstances .
HANK: They feed her intervaneously ? Louis looks at the boy with some surprise .
LOUIS: Quite a big word for such a small boy .
BEN: I 'm a doctor .
LOUIS: Oh . Well , he sounds like one .
BEN: He can spell `` haemoglobin '' but he has trouble with `` cat '' and `` dog . ''
LOUIS: And where do you practice , Doctor ?
BEN: Indianapolis , Indiana . The Good Samaritan .
HANK: Daddy liberated Africa .
BEN: I was up around Casablanca with an Army field hospital , that 's all .

HANK: And Casablanca .
LOUIS: I hope you will have time to truly enjoy Marrakesh .

LOUIS: Sometimes .
HANK: Do you eat snails .

HANK: If you ever get hungry , our garden ack home is full of snails .
LOUIS: Thank you for the invitation .
HANK: That 's all right . We tried everything to got rid of them . We never thought of a Frenchman .
BEN: Would you like to share our taxi to the hotel ?
LOUIS: That 's kind of you , doctor , but unfortunately I have some business first . Jo tries to be casual .
JO: What business are you in , Mr. Bernard ?
LOUIS: However , I 'll be there later - perhaps we might have a drink together .
BEN: All right . But I 'll serve the drinks in our suite .
LOUIS: In that case , I will take you to dinner .
BEN: No . Now that 's not a fair bargain .
LOUIS: But I know Marrakesh . I can show you an intriguing Arab restaurant where the food is different , and the manne of eating exotic .
BEN: Well that 's what we came here for . Okay , Jo ? Simple one of those Arabian Nights ? Ben takes her arm , in a warm gesture .
JO: Okay , But I 'm no Scheherazade .
BEN: You 'll do .
LOUIS: How would you prefer to travel to the hotel ? By taxi ? Fiacre ?
HANK: A wagon ! I want to ride in a wagon !

BEN: All right . Let 's assume they knew each other , and Louis Bernard did n't other to tell us . What does that mean ?

You went to a medical convention in Paris . Stopped at Rome , Lisbon , Casablanca . You once served in North Africa with an Army field Hospital
BEN: Now hold on . Wait a minute . We were just talking casually Jo shakes her head .
JO: Not talking .
BEN: What difference does it make ? I have nothing to hide .
JO: Maybe Mr. Bernard has .
BEN: Jo . I know this is mysterious Morocco . Inscrutable natives gliding through twisted , narrow streets , but
JO: Oh , Ben !
BEN: Then relax . You 're just mad because he did n't ask any questions about you .
JO: Bitter medicine , doctor . But I 'll swallow it .
HANK: What pain , mummy ?
JO: Just an expression . Ben beckons the porter .
PORTER: Bon jour , monsieur .

BEN: Good evening . My name is McKenna .
HEADWAITER: Of course . The hotel phoned . Follow me please .
JO: Ben
BEN: Sit down , Jo , please . People are staring at us .
JO: You 're right . People are staring at us .
BEN: What people ?
JO: They stared at us when we went into the hotel .
BEN: Jo , will you stop imagining things ?
MRS. DRAYTON: Good evening .
JO: Yes , I am . Mrs. Drayton turns to the man next to her .
MRS. DRAYTON: Did n't I tell you ? I knew I was right .
DRAYTON: How do you do , sir !
BEN: How do you do . We 're Mr. and Mrs. McKenna .
DRAYTON: My wife tells me Mrs. McKenna appeared at the London Palladium a few years ago .
MRS. DRAYTON: Of course we hardly ever see a show . Edward is such an old stick-in-the- mud . So I have to console myself with your records .
DRAYTON: And I must admit I love 'em . I 'm not one for this terrible Bee Bop o whatever you call it .
JO: Thank you , Mr. Drayton .
MRS. DRAYTON: When are you coming back to London ?
JO: Possibly never again , professionally .
MRS. DRAYTON: Do n't tell me you 've given up the stage .
JO: Temporarily .
BEN: It 's just that I 'm a doctor Yes . And a doctor 's wife
JO: What Ben means is that there are no Broadway musical shows produced in Indianapolis , Indiana . Of course , if we lived in New York where I hear doctors are n't starving
BEN: I have nothing against working in New York . Nothing except the fact that it 's very hard for my patients to come all the way from Indianapolis fo treatment . Drayton looks at his wife disapprovingly .
MRS. DRAYTON: Oh dear , oh dear . I 'm always saying the wrong thing .
JO: Not the least , Mrs. Drayton .
MRS. DRAYTON: Tell me ; Dr. McKenna do you always..
BEN: Do you think we could get straightened around .
DRAYTON: Only the first two fingers and thum of the right hand . Never use the smaller fingers . And always keep the left hand in the lap .
JO: Does it have something to do with eligion ?
DRAYTON: More social than religious , I 'd say .
BEN: It seems to me if you have four good fingers , and a thumb , you should use them all .
J0: Three finger four fingers for my money this is nothing but chicken in the rough . We have it at every drive- in back home .
DRAYTON: Well , as I was saying , I was quite happy farming my bit of land It Buckinghamshire , when these chaps from the United Nations started worrying me .
MRS. DRAYTON: Edward was a big noise at the Ministry of Food during the war , you know .
DRAYTON: So , I pulled myself up by the roots , and here we are . United Nations Relief .
BEN: That sounds like interesting work .
DRAYTON: You should see my report on soil erosion in Morocco But nobody reads it .
LOUIS: Trouvez nous un coin tranquille C'est possible ?
WAITER: Certainment , monsieur .
JO: Well just what do you think of that ? First he promises to take us to dinner
BEN: Look , we only met him today . We ca n't expect him to change his whole life
JO: Oh , Ben ! What 's the matter with you ? !
BEN: Nothing ! What 's the matter with you ? !
JO: I just do n't like to be both privately and publicly insulted .
BEN: Can you blame him ? Turning down an old married couple for a date with a girl like that ?
JO: We 're not an old married couple ! All ight He 's a heel . I do n't understand him and I 'm beginning not to like what he 's doing to ou whole night .
MRS. DRAYTON: I must do some shopping in the market tomorrow . I do hope it 'll be fine . Fine , but not too fine . Of course , I how our English weather is awful , but I sometimes think we do n't know when we 're lucky . All this sunshine , day after day . It seems unnatural , somehow .
BEN: I want to get up .
JO: Ben , I know you once you get worked up , you 'll start a fight . Now please , sit down and forget him .
DRAYTON: By the way , it 'd be pleasant if you 'd let us show you round the market place , tomorrow .
JO: Louis Bernard , the big buyer from Paris , was going to take us through the market tomorrow .
BEN: Good . I 'll just go over and cancel out . She pushes him down again .
JO: Ben , do n't . Our dinner 's getting cold . We 'd love to go with you .
WOMAN: C'est les deux que cherchez ?
LOUIS: Oui .
J0: Looks like he has a cure for everything .
BEN: Yeah , there 's a lot of that going around these days .
HANK: What 's he doing , Mrs. Drayton ?
MRS. DRAYTON: He 's the teller of tales , Hank . He eads legends and famous old stories from history .
HANK: Wish he 'd say something I could understand .
J0: Ben , I 'm glad we came here . It 's different , a little exciting .
BEN: Would n't you rather be in Now York ehearsing ? She takes his arm affectionately .
JO: Oh , all that talk last night was just social chit chat , Every woman who eve gave up the stage for marriage is supposed to want to go back . I was just playing a part expected of me . She pauses a second .
BEN: Well , if you do let 's talk about it seriously .
JO: No , if at all , let 's talk about it humorously .
HANK: Mummy ! Daddy !
BEN: You 're probably right .
J0: Any time he starts wearing you out
MRS. DRAYTON: I 've never enjoyed the market place so much . Oh !
HANK: Come on !
JO: Ben , this whole market place is very different and exciting .
BEN: Just like the county fairs when I was a kid . They 'd get everything but the alloon ascension . Jo starts giggling . Ben looks it her .
JO: I was just thinkingdo you know what 's paying for these three days in Marrakesh ? Ben chuckles .
HANK: Mummy ! Daddy !
BEN: You 're probably right .
JO: Any time he starts wearing you out Mrs. Drayton ad Hank go out of the picture .
BEN: I do n't know whether or not to believe you .
JO: Ben , glamour is a costume I put on once . It never fit too well . I 'd ather live my own life than one written for me .
BEN: Including sleeping with a man who always smells of ether ?
J0: I do n't have to look seductive at eakfast and worry if the Times eviewer does n't like my scrambled eggs . Drayton appears behind them .
DRAYTON: How are the acrobats today ?
BEN: Oh fine , fine . Have n't dropped anybody yet .
J0: And Allida Markle 's asthma .
BEN: Oh , I know it 's just a song and a dance here and there but it 's all he thinks about . Show business .
JO: Ben , you 're setting a trap for me .
BEN: He has a good mind . Give him a chance to develop it .
JO: You mean give him a change to be a doctor ?
BEN: I did n't say that .
JO: All right , darling , a deal 's a deal . Ben takes her hand .
BEN: And for every matinee ?
JO: Two chapters of Grey 's Anatomy .
HANK: Hey , Mummy . Sewing machines ! Looks like a television commercial .
BEN: Now If we could only get four cases of the Seven-year itch , we could retire . Or , if Mrs. Yarros really has triplets , we could at least redecorate the house .
J0: Oh , Ben , what would they say if they heard us ?
BEN: One of the reasons I came to a place like Marrakesh is so that we could say things like this without anybody hearing us .
JO: I 'd like to say something where nobody can hear us .
BEN: This is the safest place .
JO: When are we going to have another child ? Ben looks at her with some surprise .
BEN: Yeah but , but this is the first time I 've heard the question !
HANK: Hey , Mummy . Sewing machines ! Looks like a television commercial .
JO: Having a good time , Hank ?
MRS. DRAYTON: He 's delighted with everything .
BEN: Hank ! Hank come back here !
JO: Hank !
MRS. DRAYTON: Hank , it 's best to keep away from trouble . Hank is looking away toward the chase .
HANK: What 's going on ? Mrs. Drayton looks toward the trouble .
MRS. DRAYTON: It looks as though the police are chasing somebody .
LOUIS: Ils ont trouvés ils ont réussi à trouver Ben looks at him puzzled .
JO: Ben who is he ?
BEN: Louis Bernard . Got something to write on ? She begins looking in her purse .
JO: Is he dead ?
BEN: Yes . Yes . He 's dead .
POLICE ONE: Savez vous qui est cet homme ?
POLICE: J'ai dit Savez vous qui est cet homme ?
DRAYTON: Il ne parle pas francais . Je traduirái . The policeman nods . Drayton turns to Ben .
JO: Of course we know him ! It 's the frenchman , Louis Bernard .
POLICE ONE: Louis Bernard ?
POLICE MAN: Quel est le nom de ces personnes ?
DRAYTON: McKenna .
POLICE MAN: Dites leur que j'aimerai qu'ils viennent tous les deux au commissariat pou faire un rapport .
DRAYTON: Just as I thought . He wants both of you to go to police headquarters to make a statement .
BEN: Do we have to ?
DRAYTON: I 'm afraid so . Our friends here have to go to the police Station . I 'm going with them to give what help I can .
MRS. DRAYTON: You do n't want your little boy to go , do you ?
HANK: I wan na go . I never saw a French police station before .
MRS. DRAYTON: Perhaps it would be best if I took him ack to the hotel .
JO: You 're very thoughtful .
POLICE ONE: Ameneles aux Bureaux de Police .
DRAYTON: I think we 'd better set off . Heaven knows how long we shall be .
POLICE TWOO: Alons-y . Sil vous plait .
JO: Why should he suddenly turn up in Arab- outfit , wearing makeup ?
BEN: What 's more important why was he killed ?
JO: I 'll bet he was a spy , or something like that . Ben looks at her with some surprise .
BEN: I 'll tell you later . Ben looks at his hands .
JO: What is it ?
BEN: I do n't feel very good after what I said about Louis Bernard last night .
DRAYTON: Once we talk to the police inspector , I 'll do my best to out some of the red tape .
JO: I have to stretch .
DRAYTON: I 'm afraid the questions will go on till doomsday , if you admit knew this chap Bernard before .
BEN: I did n't know him at all . We only met yesterday on a bus .
DRAYTON: They 're a cynical lot , these French they might refuse to believe that .
BEN: They 'll have to believe me . It 's true .
DRAYTON: It might sound a bit odd , from thei point of view . They saw the poor chap whispering to you and then they saw you writing something down
INSPECTOR: Thank you , Monsieur Drayton , but a translator will not be necessary . Wo n't you come inside , Monsieur , Madame ? He stops aside , and wait .
BEN: That 's right .
INSPECTOR: You are a doctor , monsieur ?
BEN: A surgeon . A tourist , and an American citizen .
INSPECTOR: Three good reasons why you should have nothing in common with Louis Bernard .
BEN: I did n't have .
INSPECTOR: You were recently in Paris ?
BEN: A medical convention .
INSPECTOR: You come to Marrakesh with him in the same bus . You drank an apéritif with him in your hotel room . And you ate at the same restaurant last night .
JO: But at different tables .
INSPECTOR: So , Louis Bernard is a stranger to you ?
BEN: I met him yesterday on the bus for the first time in my life .
INSPECTOR: And yet out of five thousand people In a great market place he comes to you when he is about to die ! Is that the action of a casual acquaintance , monsieur ?
BEN: I know nothing about Louis Bernard .
INSPECTOR: No ? Not even , I suppose , that he was an agent of the Déuxieme Bureau ?
BEN: What 's that ?
INSPECTOR: Perhaps you have also never head of the American F.B.I. ? It would be so much more easy for both of us , monsieur , if you would cease to pretend .
BEN: Now , look here
INSPECTOR: The dead man found out what he had een sent here to discover . That is why he was kill-ed . He told you what he had discovered . Why ? Because he placed complete confidence in you . Voila .
BEN: Boy , you not only ask the questions you also answer them Wait a minute let me ask you a question .
INSPECTOR: Indeed , Monsieur ?
BEN: Assuming Bernard trusted me as implicitly as you say , I would neve eveal anything he said to me , would
INSPECTOR: Even Americans , I suppose , sometimes find it desirable to betray a confidence ?
BEN: Let 's get something straight . I 'm a tourist traveling for pleasure . I somehow got involved in an unfortunate incident . I came down here to make a simple statement of fact , and not to e subjected to a police grilling .
INSPECTOR: Monsieur , I would like .
BEN: Now hold your horses ! Just hold them .
POLICE TWO: Inspecteur . On demande Monsieur McKenna au téléphone .
INSPECTOR: Laissez nous , nous sommes occuppes .
BEN: Wait a minute . A telephone call fo me ?
INSPECTOR: Mais enfin , voyons !
BEN: I 'll take the call now . You just take it easy .
INSPECTOR: Madame McKenna .
JO: I do n't know a thing ,
BEN: Hello .
ARAB: Doctor McKenna ?
BEN: This is McKenna . Who 's calling me ?
ARAB: You tell even one word of that Louis Bernard whispered to you in the market- place your little boy will be in serious danger . The Arab starts to hang up .
BEN: Hello .
DRAYTON: As I recall . Why ? Ben picks up the phone , hands it to Drayton .
BEN: Call her . Somebody just threatened me about Hank . See if he 's all right .
DRAYTON: Passez moi l'hôtel Mamounia , s'il vous plait . Voulez vous appeler la chambre deux cents dix sept s'il vous plait . je vois , Puis-je parler au , concierge ? Ah ! ici Mr. Drayton de la chambre deux cents dix sept. Est ce que ma femme est revenue a l'hôtel depuis une heure ? Sa chambre ne répond pas . je vois bien bien merci Oh ! Un instant s'il vous plait .
BEN: Four fourteen .
DRAYTON: Voulez vous essayer la chambre quatre cents quatorze ? Merci . Ben slowly hangs up . Looks at Ben .
BEN: She did n't come back ?
DRAYTON: At least nobody 's seen her . What on earth
BEN: Look you get back to the hotel right away and see if you can find out what 's going on .
DRAYTON: It 's so unlike my wife
BEN: I 'll finish up with the police and join you as soon as I can .
DRAYTON: Right . But do n't worry . Probably some stupid misunderstanding . If I find out anything before you get ack , I 'll ring you here .
BEN: Just do n't waste any time !
JO: Who was it , Ben ?
BEN: It was the Concierge at the Hotel . He heard we were being held by the Police and thought there was some way he could help us .
JO: That was nice of him .
BEN: I told him if we were n't back there in fifteen minutes to call the American Consulate in Casablanca .
INSPECTOR: But , Monsieur , if you had only told me in the first place , that you wished to consult with your consul ! Ben gives him a look .
BEN: Let 's go , Jo .
INSPECTOR: There is just one small formality . I must request you to sign a statement of the facts .
BEN: If it does n't take too long .
INSPECTOR: But a moment . I will send for a typist .
JO: Ben
BEN: I do n't I do n't think you should . She holds out her hand more firmly .
JO: I 'm your wife , Ben not the police inspector . Let 's see it .
J0: Why did n't you give this to the police ?
BEN: Because I did n't want to .
JO: But Ben , a man 's life
BEN: is at stake , I know , But I 'm not sure of what 's the right thing to do .
J0: I thought we ought to go back to the hotel , pack our clothes , take Hank , and get out of this country as quickly as we can .
BEN: Maybe .
JO: Hank , seeing a man killed in front of him . What a shook it must be to his mind .
BEN: I know .
JO: Why do n't you just give that note to the American Consulate Why get any more involved ?
BEN: Joabout Hank
JO: What about him ?
BEN: Wellhehe 's the kind of a kid who can take of himself .
JO: Okay .
BEN: Uhpardon me . The head Porter turns to Ben respectfully .
HEAD PORTER: Yes , m'sieu ?
BEN: Do you know Mrs. Drayton ?
HEAD PORTER: The English lady ?
BEN: Did you see her come back from the market place anytime in the past hou or so ?
HEAD PORTER: No , m'sieu .
BEN: Wait a minute . You do n't understand she had a small boy with her . Mine .
HEAD PORTER: No , m'sieu .
BEN: How about Mister Drayton ?
HEAD PORTER: Oui , m'sieu . M'sieu Drayton check out .
BEN: He what ?
HEAD PORTER: Checked out . Ben stares at him .
BEN: He could n't have .
HEAD PORTER: Oui , m'sieu . He did .
BEN: No , Mr. Drayton , the Englishman with horn-rimmed glasses . The Head Porter nods in agreement .
HEAD PORTER: Oui , m'sieu . Checked out .
JO: Ben , What 's holding you up ?
BEN: Jo , hold the call for a minute .
JO: Why ?
BEN: Because I asked you to .
JO: Benwe 're about to have our monthly fight .
BEN: I hope we do n't .
JO: Then stop playing Rasputin . I only said I was going to call Mrs. Drayton . She reaches for the phone again . He turns .
BEN: Wait 'til I come back .
JO: I 'm so relaxed I 'm tired . You take them .
BEN: Jo , they 're for you . I 'm the doctor .
JO: Ben
BEN: You know how you get when things happen tense and upset . Now do me a favor . She stands up .
JO: Six months ago you told me I took too many pills !
BEN: Six months ago you were n't a witness to a murder . You 've been excited , fatigued talking a blue streak and going around in circles .
JO: I have not . Ben takes a deep breath .
BEN: Jo , I make my living knowing when and how to administer medicine . You 'll feel a lot better tomorrow if you take these today . But you do n't think so . Okay , I 'll make a deal with you .
JO: I 'm listening .
BEN: There 's something about Louis Bernard , the police station , and this whole spy usiness that I have n't told you yet . He holds out the capsules .
JO: What could it be ?
BEN: There 's one way to find out .
JO: All right , Doctor McKenna . I am now elaxed and listening .
BEN: Just a minute . This whole thing strange ight from the very beginning .
JO: See .
BEN: Yesyes , you were right about him . He waswas strange .
JO: I know all that . Get to the surprise .
BEN: He got talking to us because he was on the lookout for a suspicious married couple .
JO: Nothing suspicious about us .
BEN: He was wrong . It was a different married couple .
JO: And he was killed before he found them .
BEN: No . He found them . In the restaurant . Last night . That 's why he was killed .
JO: You 'll be telling me next it was Mr. and Mrs. Drayton !
BEN: That 's just who it was , Jo .
JO: If that 's a joke , I do n't think it 's a very funny one .
BEN: Listen to me . And listen carefully . She comes awake more , studies him .
JO: Hank ? Why H ?
BEN: They 've taken him away .
JO: Mrs. Drayton took Hank back to the hotel . She is downstairs ! He stands up .
BEN: Mrs. Drayton has vanished ! She neve came back here ! And Hank did n't either !

BEN: All I did was wire Val and Helen Parnell to get us rooms He indicates fans and newspapermen .
EDINGTON: I 'm Inspector Edington of the Criminal Investigation Department of Scotland Yard .

EDINGTON: As things are , there 's no need for you to go through the Customs . Will you come this way !
BEN: Whatever you say .
EDINGTON: This Way , please .
WOBURN: How do you do ?
BEN: Now what do you people want with us ?
WOBURN: Mr. Buchanan would like to have a chat with you , inside .
BEN: Who is Mr. Buchanan ?
WOBURN: Special Branch , Scotland Yard .
BUCHANAN: How do you do ? Ben nods to him without speaking .
BEN: Why does Scotland Yard want to talk with us ?
BUCHANAN: Let me say at once , we 're shocked that you son was taken from you in Marrakesh and deeply sympathetic .
JO: Do you know where he is ? Ben is somewhat more reserved .
BEN: What about Hank ? What have you heard ?
BUCHANAN: I only wish I could give you some cheerful news .
BEN: I think they took him for money .
BUCHANAN: Then why did n't you go straight to your Consulate in Casablanca ? Why did you come to London ?
JO: Mr. Buchanan
BEN: Jo
BUCHANAN: You 're convinced that these people ought your son to London . You 're convinced you can find him off you own bat . You ca n't . It 's impossible . But with the help we can give you , there 's a chance . A really good chance .
JO: They told us not to say anything !
BUCHANAN: Anything you tell me will be in the most absolute confidence . Ben starts to interrupt .
BEN: That might be true , but Buchanan holds up a hand to interrupt him .
BUCHANAN: Your son is the trump card these people hold . He 's perfectly safe for the moment .
JO: And when they 've done what they 're going to do , they 'll let him go . So all we have to do is wait .
BUCHANAN: No , Mrs. McKenna . If they conside the boy a nuisance , afterwards I 'm afraid He gestures .
BEN: Now , do n't try to frighten us , Mr. Buchanan .
BUCHANAN: It 's exactly what I 'm trying to do frighten you . I 'm trying to prevent a man being murdered here , in London .
JO: Ben , what can we do by ourselves ? We need
BEN: You worked on the wrong McKenna , Mr. Buchanan . Louis Bernard talked to me , not my wife . Buchanan turns to Ben .
BUCHANAN: Then you tell me .
BEN: Bernard spoke in French , and I do n't understand a word of the language . There is a pause while Buchanan studies Ben .
BUCHANAN: And what did you write down on a piece of paper ?
JO: Ben maybe they could find those people , and Hank , before
BEN: Maybe . Maybe is n't good enough fo me , and it should n't be good enough for you .
JO: You act as if you 're the only one who 's concerned about Hank .
BEN: Now Jo , I did n't mean it that way . We made up our minds what we were going to do now let 's try to stick to it . Ben turns to Buchanan .
BUCHANAN: I have a son of my own . I do n't know what I 'd do
BEN: Well , maybe if we

JAN: Cindy !
CINDY: You do n't know what psychosomatic means .
JAN: I do too ! It means when your mind gets sick of your body it does something to it
CINDY: The doctor 's trying to talk on the phone . Ben tries to be casual and amiable .
BEN: It 's only business . It 's nothing . Helen Parnell flops into a chair .
HELEN: Business is everything . Shhh . They all fall silent , and watch Ben . He is uncomfortable .

J0: Ben , please
BEN: It has to be done , Jo .
J0: I Want to go with you .
CINDY: Jan , how somebody so graceful can have such an awkward sense of diplomacy , I 'll never know .
BEN: You ca n't . I wo n't disappear . Promise .
JO: Ben , for the last time , please let me go . He pats her affectionately on the cheek .
BEN: Two people are much easier to follow than one . We do n't want Buchanan 's men on our tracks . Or the other people , either . I 'm going out by the service entrance
WORKMAN: Yes ?
BEN: II 'd like to speak to Mr. Ambrose Chappell , please .
WORKMAN: Come in . He opens the door , and Ben enters .
BEN: Well you see , I uh There is a twinkle in the old man 's eye .
CHAPPELL SR: Certainly . It happens all the time . You expected someone else Just a moment . Ambrose !
BEN: I 'm Doctor Mckenna . Does the name mean anything to you ?
CHAPPELL: I do n't think so .
BEN: You have no idea why I came here ?
VAL: and back at our flat , after the first night , Chris had the nerve to suggest that the sketch where Bud Flanagan comes in dressed up as the Countess was unconvincing that no matter how well-got-up Bud Flanagan was , even if he were dressed by Hartnell , nobody would believe he was an aristocrat . So I said , 'Look Chris , why do n't you cut William Hickey 's column out of the paper ? !
JO: Huh ?
VAL: What 's become of that unpredictable husband of yours ? He 's been gone over an hour . She does n't answer , so he goes on .
JO: No . Noyou mean Chappell !
J0: Do they list chapels in the London Telephone Directory ?
VAL: Let 's a take a look .
JO: I 'm very sorry .
CINDY: There 's something weird going on around here that I ca n't follow .
VAL: Let 's see if we can figure this out . First of all there was a man named to uh
HELEN: Ambrose Chapel .
CINDY: And Ben rushed off to see him .
HELEN: Then Jo said it was n't a man , but a place and she dashed off .
JAN: Do n't mention it again or I might dash off .
CINDY: What a temptation .
HELEN: Can you fathom it , Val ? Val paces thoughtfully , and they watch him .
VAL: It must be a now American gag . I 'll ask Danny about it .
BEN: Where 's Jo ?
VAL: She 's just gone off to Ambrose Chapel . Immediately Ben puts down the drink .
BEN: But but , that 's where I 've been He stands up .
VAL: It is n't your Ambrose Chapel ! Ben looks at him questioningly .
HELEN: It is n't a he ! It 's an it ! A building .
CINDY: She 's just gone there .
BEN: Where is it ! What 's the address ?
VAL: 17 Ambrose Street , Bayswater .
JAN: Doctor ! Doctor ! It 's Jo ! Come back it 's Jo .
BEN: Jo ?
JO: Ben Ben , darlingwhat happened did you find anything ?
BEN: No I drew a complete blank .
JO: Then it must be the chapel - and I 've found it , Ben . It 's just a short way from here . It was a crazy thing to do
BEN: I have the address , Jo . Now stay there until I get thereand do n't do anything !
JO: I 'll meet you outside .
BEN: Will you stick around ? We 'll be back as soon as we can . I do n't know how to thank you .
HANK: Three men ! You do n't know much about checkers , do you ?
MRS. DRAYTON: It 's time you went to bed , dear . You 'll get tired out .
HANK: Can I finish ? I 'm winning ?
MRS. DRAYTON: Yes , you finish . Edna , see that he gets some milk and biscuits .
EDNA: And he 'd better have another sleeping pillI 've got to get downstairs
MRS. DRAYTON: You 'll go to sleep , Hank , wo n't you ?
HANK: I guess so .
EDNA: Hurry up if you want to finish this game .
MRS. DRAYTON: Look it does n't hurt to be kind . Yell out when you want me to open the door .
DRAYTON: That 's not a very orthodox sentiment .
RIEN: What is it ?
DRAYTON: A record of the delightful Picco they will play tonight .
RIEN: What about it ?
DRAYTON: Music is less in your line than marksmanship . If you will listen , my friend , I will play for you the exact moment at which you can shoot . Now listen carefully . Drayton plays the record .
RIEN: None except one you mean . The assassin smiles .
DRAYTON: Ah , yes if you are clever , my friend . Any questions musical or otherwise ?
RIEN: No .
DRAYTON: There's 's one comforting thought . It happens early in the evening . I hope I wo n't upset you if I say there 's time for one shot only . If you need another , the risk is yours .
RIEN: I do not take risks .
DRAYTON: That 's a comfort traipsing all the way down to Marrakesh to fetch you I should like you to do me credit . He looks at his watch .
RIEN: You will have the money when I return ?
DRAYTON: I think you can trust me .
RIEN: What is your English proverb a wolf in Sheep 's clothing ? Drayton laughs .
DRAYTON: I think you had better be going . It is impolite to be late for a concert . It would be awkward if they made you wait until the first selection is over . He turns to his wife .
JO: There it is .
BEN: You may have just hit it right on the nose . You ca n't be farther wrong than I was with my Ambrose Chapel . Let 's go .
JO: Ben , should we get some help from the police ?
BEN: No , honey , please , no let 's take a crack at this alone .
JO: Let 's wait and look around
BEN: Look who 's coming down the aisle .
DRAYTON: Brothers and Sisters The subject of my address this evening is adversity . The average life , yours and mine , is often harassed and perplexed by cruelties and disappointments beyond our control .
BEN: That 's Buchanan 's phone number . Go on out and call him and ask him to surround the place with police .
JO: What if he asks me
BEN: Tell himtell him everything . This is the time . I 'm sure Hank is around here some place .
JO: Ben , I do n't want to leave you .
BEN: I do n't know how else to do it , honey .
DRAYTON: Few of us pause to think how life 's adversities work in our behalf , to make better men and women of us .
DRAYTON: Well this is a pleasant surprise , Doctor .
BEN: Where 's my boy , Drayton ?
DRAYTON: He 's upstairs . As a matter of fact you 've just come in time to help my wife with Hank 's food . Seems Hank does n't care much for English cooking .
BEN: What do you want ? I 'll give you money and keep my mouth shut . All I want is my boy .
DRAYTON: And what about your wife ? Did she go outside just to get some fresh air .
BEN: Tell me what you want . I 'll do anything .
DRAYTON: All right you 'll see your boy in good time .
BEN: Hank ! Hank McKenna ! Hank ! Where are you ? Hank ! Hank !
HANK: Daddy ! Daddy , I 'm here ! Dad -
JO: And Ben is in there now , watching the both of them !
J0: He sent me out to call you so we could do something before they get away .
WOBURN: I see , Mrs. McKenna and you believe your son is somewhere in the chapel ?
JO: I do n't know , I do n't know where he isbut at least these people will know the Draytons . If you 'd only send somebody to get them .
WOBURN: I 'm afraid it is n't quite as easy as all that .
J0: Mr. Woburn , there is n't any time ! My husband is sitting in that chapel waiting for me to bring some help . Ca n't I talk with Mr. Buchanan ? He said when we needed him , to call .
WOBURN: I 'm awfully sorry , but I simply ca n't get hold of him just now . He 's gone to a rather important diplomatic affair at the Albert Hall .
JO: Well call him there , please ! Call him !
WOBURN: He 's on his way . I do n't know quite
JO: Then ca n't you do anything right away before we lose the Draytons ?
WOBURN: I assure you , I 'll do all I cant as soon as I can .
JO: We do n't have days to do this . It 's a matter of minutes . Ca n't you send the police . Or do I have to go to the Albert Hall myself .
WOBURN: That wo n't be necessary . I 'll see that the chapel is put under immediate observation . By the time you get back a police car should be there . Please eturn to your husband , tell him to come straight out of the chapel , and let the police take over . He turns to the other phone .
JO: There 's nobody there !
PATTERSON: Are you Mrs. McKenna ?
JO: Yes , but something 's wrong . A few minutes ago the place was full of people , and now there 's nobody !
PATTERSON: Our orders are to keep it unde observation until a Scotland Yard ca arrives .
JO: My husband 's in there . There must have been thirty or forty people and now Patterson looks at her carefully .
PATTERSON: When was this ?
JO: It couldn'tit could n't have been more than five minutes ago !
PATTERSON: Let 's take a look .
JO: I told Mr. Woburn he had to hurry .
PATTERSON: I 'm sorry , madam , we ca n't break in . Requires a search warrant . It 's the law , you see .
JO: Could n't you get one ?
PATTERSON: It all takes time . We 'll have a look ound , shall we ? Matthews , you take the other end .
MATTHEWS: All right .
PATTERSON: Are you quite certain the place was full of people only a few minutes ago ?
JO: Of course I 'm certain . I was there myself , sitting next to my husband . He sent me out to call Scotland Yard . He looks at her quizzically .
J0: It 's much too complicated to explain .
PATTERSON: We 'll just have to sit tight and wait for the car to arrive from the Yard .
WALDEN: Okay .
PATTERSON: That 's all , Matthews .
JO: You 're not leaving ?
PATTERSO: Orders , madam . Can we give you lift somewhere ?
JO: Yes , I want to go to Albert Hall .
PATTERSON: Afraid the Albert Hall 's a bit off ou eat . Suppose we drop you at the nearest taxi rank ? Jo looks back at the Chapel briefly .
JO: All right . Let 's go .
GUARD: Hello . Hello .
BUTLER: Do what he says . Come on . It will only be a minute . Come on , all of you out . The man goes to the door .
WOMAN COOK: This embassy there 's always something queer going on .
ANOTHER VOICE: Bringing people in , in secret
UNIFORMED ATTENDANT: Seats at a guinea . Starting Room three and six Jo moves out of the queue and addresses him .
JO: I would like to see the manager , please .
UNIFORMED ATTENDANT: I 'm sorry , madam , The manager 's on duty in the lobby . So 's his assistant .
JO: Please , I must speak to one of them . Which are they ?
UNIFORMED ATTENDANT: Over there somewhere He resumes his chant .
1ST GIRL: Is that the Prime Minister ?
2ND GIRL: No , that 's only the Ambassador . The Prime Minister 's the one with the bald head .
1ST GIRL: Well , I 'll guarantee he 's got a bette seat than we have .
RIEN: You have a very nice little boy , madame .
J0: Where Is he ? Where is he ?
TICKET COLLECTOR: Your ticket , madam ? Jo shakes her heads .
JO: If you do n't mind , I 'm just looking for someone .
BEN: Then he did n't kill him ?
ASSISTANT MANAGER: Your wife saved him it is only a small flesh woundOh here he is nowyou must come and meet himdo n't e nervousI 'll get the aide to present youit will be all right Would you present the lady to the prime minister ?
BUCHANAN: I 'll report to you fully at the Embassy , Your Excellency . In the meantime
WOBURN: Mr. Prime Minister , this is the lady who
PRIME MINISTER: My dear lady , I shall be for ever in your debt .
WOBURN: And this is her husband The Prime Minister interrupts again , less enthusiastically .
PRIME MINISTER: A pleasure , my dear sir I trust you will permit me to wait upon you tomorrow and to express the depth of my gratitude .
JO: It was n't it was n't
PRIME MINISTER: Oh but it was , my dear lady .
WOBURN: I think Mr. Buchanan would like to talk to you .
JO: Where 's our boy ? Where 's Hank ?
BUCHANAN: We can talk if you 'll come in here .
BEN: Do n't be a fool .
BUCHANAN: An odd coincidence both of you turning up here .
BEN: Too bad you did n't contact you assistant . He sent us both here .
BUCHANAN: I beg your pardon .
BEN: You see , we finally needed that help you offered . We still need it .
JO: Yes , Mr. Buchanan . We still need it .
DETECTIVE: Sir ? Buchanan nods to him to speak .
BUCHANAN: I 'll see her later .
DETECTIVE: Very good , sir .
BUCHANAN: Please tell me everything , now . Everything . There 's still plenty of room for hope , Mrs. McKenna
FOOTMAN: His Excellency will see you now .
AMBASSADOR: YesyesI see . Well if the woman wo n't talk , she wo n't talk and that 's that , I suppose . All right .
DRAYTON: Excuse me sir , I have a lot to explain to you something very unusual has happened . I must also have the money to pay our French marksman .
AMBASSADOR: Would n't it be superfluous , considering that he 's dead ?
DRAYTON: I do n't see how you can hold me esponsible . He was most warmly ecommended by our people in Marrakesh
AMBASSADOR: I 'm glad you 're able to treat the matte so lightly . I am holding a reception here this evening . In a few minutes , I have to welcome our Prime Ministe as my guest of honor when I hope and expected that he would be totally unable to attend . That amuses you , no doubt ?
DRAYTON: I do n't know what to say
AMBASSADOR: No . But I do . You 've muddled everything from the start . Kidnapping that child in MarrakeshDo n't you ealize that Americans dislike having their children kidnapped ?
DRAYTON: How else could I make sure the American would hold his tongue ?
AMBASSADOR: And then , to crown it all , you get cold feet and come running along here to hide and bring the child with you Do n't you see what you 've done to the diplomatic status of this Embassy ?
DRAYTON: I did n't thinkI only thought
AMBASSADOR: How are you going to get the child out of here , eh ? Eh ? Eh ? Eh ?
DRAYTON: There 's no difficulty about that , surely ? The car
AMBASSADOR: With plain-clothes detectives planted ight round this building ? You English intellectuals will be the death of us all .
DRAYTON: I 'll think of some method . Just give me time .
AMBASSADOR: Time !
MRS. DRAYTON: Oh , no !
DRAYTON: Right , I 'll see to it..
AMBASSADOR: Come in . The door opens and a butler enters .
BUTLER: Your Excellency , the Princess should e arriving at any moment .
BEN: recognized him , and he recognized me . So he jumped for it . And that is all .
BUCHANAN: Trying to liquidate one of their own ig-shots . I wish they 'd stick to their usual custom , and do it in thei own country
WOBURN: Hello . Hold on . He turns the telephone over to Buchanan .
BUCHANAN: Buchanan speaking .
JO: How do you know ?
BUCHANAN: We have ways of finding out from the inside .
BEN: If the Draytons are at the Embassy , Hank has to be there too ! Buchanan turns his attention back to Ben .
BUCHANAN: You 're probably right . But we can do nothing .
BEN: Why ca n't you ?
BUCHANAN: Every Embassy in a foreign country has extra-territorial rights .
BEN: What does that mean in common language ?
BUCHANAN: As far as we 're concerned , this Embassy stands on foreign soil .
BEN: Does that mean they can steal children and get away with it ?
BUCHANAN: We could have the Foreign Office serve a writ on the Ambassador .
BEN: What 's the telephone number of this Embassy .
WONBURN: Grosvenor 0144 .
JO: What are you thinking about , Ben ?
BEN: Grosvenor 0144 .
JO: What am I supposed to say , Ben ? I do n't know Ben , half looking at Woburn and Buchanan , gives her instructions .
BFN: He said he wanted to visit us soon so he could thank you .
PRIME MINISTER: My dear ladyThis is a charming surprise
JO: He said all right .
AIDE: Good even . Would you come this way , please ? The Prime Minister is waiting for you .
PRIME MINISTER: Good evening , good evening !
AMBASSADOR: Madame , you saved the life of the one man , who is irreplaceable in ou Country .
PRIME MINISTER: They tell me you are the famous Jo Conway , Madame ?
JO: Yes . I 'm Jo Conway .
PRIME MINISTER: Do you think perhaps Madame might be persuaded to sing ?
BEN: I 'm sure she would be glad to would n't you dear ?
JO: Well , I do n't know . It 's been some time
PRIME MINISTER: I beg you , Madame . A tranquil coda to conclude a dramatic evening !
JO: All right . I 'm very flattered .
AMBASSADOR: Stanis would you put up some chairs quickly . Ladies and gentlemen , we have with us tonightJo Conwaythe famous Jo Conwayshe has graciously consented to sing for us .. Darling would you see that the Prime Minister has a very good seat .
AIDE: Would you like to sit down , sir ?
BEN: NoI 'll just stand over here .
HANK: That 's my Mother 's voice ! That 's my Mother singing !
MRS. DRAYTON: Hank are you sure ? Are you really sure ?
HANK: That 's her ! I know it !
MRS. DRAYTON: What is she doing here ?
HANK: I guess so . She kneels down quickly to him .
MRS DRAYTON: Then go on whistle it . Whistle it as loud as you can .
DRAYTON: You two wait in the mail room . I 'll ing him down .
BEN: I do n't think you want to start any shooting , Drayton with all those people downstairs , and police outside .
MRS. DRAYTON: You 've got to let the boy go !
DRAYTON: Precisely my own notion , my dear .
BEN: Do n't ask me for help , you miserable .
DRAYTON: You would n't want your father to get hurt , would you ?
BEN: There wo n't be . Hank do n't say o do anything .

FRANK: Sportsmanship ! That 's my point . June fly , Ed ? Mosquito ? Which of these ? Well , what fish do you seek ?

ED: You know who *who* is ?
DAVE: The sonofabitch . The blackmailer . It 's , uh , it 's no one you know . It 's a businessman from Sacramento . A goddamn pansy , Ed . He tried to rope me into some crackpot scheme ; I heard him out and then told him to go to hell . And the very next day , the very next day , Ed , I get blackmailed for the same amount .
ED: Would he it sounds pretty obvious .
DAVE: Well , I guess he do n't care that it 's obvious .
ED: Mm . How , uh how did he know that
DAVE: He 's staying at the hotel I 've gone to with , uh , with the lady in question . Must 've seen us .
ED: Why do n't you just pay him , Dave ?
DAVE: That 's my capitalization on the Annex ! *My* operation , Ed ! Christ almighty . That 's what I was just talking to Doris about , a way of getting the money from the store that we could hide from Ann .

ED: You do n't like the music out there ?
BIRDY: It 's OK , I guess . No , I do n't really . I 'm not big on music , ordinarily . A woman calls sharply from offscreen

ED: Ann , will you come in , sit down , maybe have a drink ?
ANN: Sometimes knowledge is a curse , Ed . After this happened , things changed . Big Dave he never touched me again . Ed says nothing . She touches his arm .
RIEDENSCHNEIDER: It stinks .
DORIS: But it 's true .
RIEDENSCHNEIDER: I do n't care it 's true , it 's not true ; it stinks . You say he was being lackmailed ; by who ? You do n't know . For having an affair ; with who ? You do n't know . Did anyone else know about it ? Probably not ; you do n't know .
ED: I knew about it . Big Dave told me about it , and the spot he was putting himself in by getting the money .
RIEDENSCHNEIDER: Terrific . Your husband backs you up . That 's terrific . He starts pacing .
ED: It was Big Dave 's .

But sometimes , you look at it , your looking *changes* it . Ya ca n't know the reality of what happened , or what *would've* happened if you hadden a stuck in your goddamn schnozz . So there *is* no 'what happened . ' Not in any sense that we can grasp with our puny minds . Because our minds out minds get in the way . Looking at something changes it . They call it the 'Uncertainty Principle . ' Sure , it sounds screwy , ut even Einstein says the guy 's on to something .

But we ca n't *know* what eally happened ! Because of Fritz , or Werner , or whatever the hell his name is ! And because Me Prosecuto is *also* a lazy fat-assed sonofabitch who decided it 's easier to victimize your wife ! Because it 's easier *not* to look ! Because the more you look , the less you know ! But the beauty of it is , we do n't * got ta * know ! We just got ta show that , goddamnit , *they* do n't know . Reasonable doubt . Science . The atom . *You* explain it to me . Go ahead . Try .

GRAHAM: Jack , this is Graham . Is Price still in Latent Prints ?
SPRINGFIELD: Our people swear he wore surgeons ' gloves the whole time . They dusted everything .
GRAHAM: The report did n't mention nails and eyes .
SPRINGFIELD: Why do you think he took his gloves off ?

DR. PRINCI: This is what the subject 's teeth look like . The Smithsonian in Washington reconstructed them from the impressions we took of bite marks off the Leeds woman here and off the Jacobi woman last month in Birmingham . As you can see , he has pegged lateral incisors the teeth here and here . The teeth look like teeth from a small bear .
SPRINGFIELD: Investigator Graham has worked this kind of thing before . Can you add anything ?

SPRINGFIELD: What did the psychologists say was wrong with Lecter ?
GRAHAM: Psychologists call him a sociopath . They do n't know what else to call him .

SPRINGFIELD: I understand he cut you pretty good
GRAHAM: ( cold right turn What about the dog ?

LOUNDS: Come on , Graham ? ! Talk to me !
CRAWFORD: Get the hell away from here , Lounds !
GRAHAM: snuck in the hospital while I was sedated , flipped back the sheets and shot pictures . The only decent thing he did was run a black square over my balls
CRAWFORD: I know
GRAHAM: Atlanta and Birmingham can run the thumb print against known sex offenders . Five will get you ten they do n't come up with an identification . Jimmie may in the Finder program if he 's ever been printed and in his Index .
CRAWFORD: Say we 've arrested a good suspect . You walk in and see him . What is there about him that does n't surprise you ?
GRAHAM: I do n't know , Jack . He 's got no face for me .
CRAWFORD: You can tell something about him or we would n't have found the finge print . ..
GRAHAM: We find an event that connects both families . Same vacation hotel ; same hospital , different times . Then we check employees and come up with a male nurse , hairdresser , whatever If we find out how he found them , then we 'll find him .
CRAWFORD: We 're running it through the computers now . So far there 's no event or service that doubles back into both families . Plus they were ig consumers snowmobiles , fishing trips , scuba , videogames , lots of outine medical and dental . It 's a haystack . What 's the other ?
GRAHAM: He makes noise going in and the husband gets to a gun in time .
CRAWFORD: No other possibilities ?
GRAHAM: You think I 'm gon na spot him 'across a crowded room ? ' That 's Ezio Pinza you 're thinking about .
MORE: 21 .
CRAWFORD: Why ?
GRAHAM: Because he has a genuine taste fo it , Jack .
CRAWFORD: See ? You do know something about him .
GRAHAM: I 'm going to see Lecter .
CRAWFORD: For Christ 's sake , why ?
GRAHAM: To recover the mind set .
DR. CHILTON: Dr. Bloom called me yesterday , Mr. Graham . Or should I call you Dr. Graham ?
DR. CHILTON: Dr. Lecter will stay in his room . That is absolutely the only place where he is not put in full body estraints . One wall of his room is a double barrier . I will have a chair put just outside .
GRAHAM: I might have to show him some material that could stimulate him .
DR. CHILTON: As long as it 's on soft paper . You may find this curious .
GRAHAM: No .
DR. CHILTON: When you saw Dr. Lecktor 's murders , their 'style , ' so to speak , were you able to reconstruct his fantasies ? And did that help you identify him ?
GRAHAM: I want to see Lecktor now .
DR. CHILTON: Uh sure
LECKTOR: That 's the same atrocious aftershave you wore in court three years ago .
GRAHAM: I keep getting it for Christmas .
LECKTOR: Did you get my card ?
GRAHAM: I got it . Thank you .
LECKTOR: And how is Officer Stuart ? The one who was the first to see my basement .
GRAHAM: Stuart is fine .
LECKTOR: Emotional problems , I hear . He was a very promising young officer . Do you ever have any problems , Will ?
GRAHAM: No .
LECKTOR: Of course , you do n't . I 'm glad you came . My callers are all professional . Clinical psychiatrists from cornfield colleges somewhere . Second-raters , the lot .
GRAHAM: Dr. Bloom showed me your article on surgical addiction in the journal of Clinical Psychiatry .
LECKTOR: And ?
GRAHAM: Very interesting , even to a layman .
LECKTOR: A layman.. , layman . Interesting term . So many experts on government grants . And you say you 're a 'layman ? ' But it was you who caught me , was n't it , Will ? Do you know how you did it '
GRAHAM: You 've read the transcript . It 's all there .
LECKTOR: No it 's not . Do you know how you Did it Will ?
GRAHAM: It 's in the transcript . What does it matter now ?
LECKTOR: It does n't matter to me , Will .
GRAHAM: I want you to help me , Dr. Lecktor .
LECKTOR: Yes , I thought so .
GRAHAM: It 's about Atlanta and Birmingham .
LECKTOR: Yes .
GRAHAM: You read about it , I 'm sure .
LECKTOR: In the papers . I do n't rear out the articles . I would n't want them to think I was dwelling on anything morbid . You want to know how he 's choosing them , do n't you ?
GRAHAM: I thought you would have some ideas .
LECKTOR: Why should I tell you ?
GRAHAM: There are things you do n't have . Research materials I could speak to the Chief of Staff ?
LECKTOR: Chilton ? Gruesome , is n't he ? He fumbles at your head like a freshman pulling at a panty girdle . He actually tries to give me a Thematic and Apperception test . Hah . Sat there waiting for MF-13 to come up . It 's a card with a woman in bed and a man in the foreground . I was supposed to avoid a sexual interpretation . I laughed in his face . Never mind , it 's boring .
GRAHAM: You 'll get to see the file on this case . And there 's another reason .
LECKTOR: Pray tell .
GRAHAM: I thought you might be curious to find our if you 're smarter than the person I 'm looking for .
LECKTOR: Then by implication , you think that you are smarter than me , since you caught me .
GRAHAM: No . I knew that I 'm nor smarte than you are .
LECKTOR: Then how did you catch me , Will ?
GRAHAM: You had disadvantages .
LECKTOR: What disadvantage ? .
GRAHAM: You 're insane .
LECKTOR: You 're very tan , Will .
GRAHAM: I do n't think I 'll persuade you . You 'll do it or you wo n't . Dr. Bloom is working an it anyway , and he 's the best
LECKTOR: Do you have the file with you
GRAHAM: Yes .
LECKTOR: Pictures ?
GRAHAM: Yes .
LECKTOR: let me have them , , and I might consider it .
GRAHAM: No .
LECKTOR: Do you dream much , Will ?
GRAHAM: Good-bye , Dr. Lecktor .
LECKTOR: You have n't threatened to take away my books yet . Graham gets up and starts to walk away .
LECKTOR: What were the yards like ?
GRAHAM: Big backyards , fences , some hedges , why ?
LECKTOR: Because , my dear Will , if this Pilgrim imagines he has a elationship with the full moon , he might go outside and look at it . Have you seen blood in moonlight , Will ? It appears quite black . If one were nude , it would be bette to have outdoor privacy for this sort of thing .
GRAHAM: That 's interesting .
LECKTOR: It 's not 'interesting ' . You thought of it before .
GRAHAM: Yes . I 'd considered it .
LECKTOR: You came here to look at me , Will . To get the old scent again , did n't you ?
GRAHAM: I want your opinion .
LECKTOR: I do n't have one right now .
GRAHAM: When you do have one I 'd like to hear it .
LECKTOR: May I keep the file ?
GRAHAM: I have n't decided yet .
LECKTOR: I 'll study it , Will . When you get more files , I 'd like to see them , too . You can call me . When I have to call my lawyer , they bring me a telephone . Would you like to give me your home number ? Threat .

I 'm figuring Geehan , you lucky sonofabitch , you gon na unload this turkey . Then the squad car rolls up . They ask a coupla questions . The good officers give them the whole fuckin ' guided tour . Who was laying where . Where all the blood sprayed terrific ! Off they go in their Sedan DeVille the hell out of here .
GRAHAM: Have any single men asked to look at it ?
GEEHAN: Have n't asked me . Took four coats of interior latex , five in places . You can drop that key in the mailbox . You do n't have to come ack by , do you ?
GRAHAM: Uh-uh . Geehan leaves . The door closes with a SLAM .
GEEHAN: They do n't build houses this way anymore solid lath and plaste construction . None of your drywall stuff and aluminum studs here . No sirree Bob !
WIFE: I like it , hon .
HUSBAND: Let 's go to your office and see if we can work out some terms
GEEHAN: Great . You goin ' love this house !
GRAHAM: I 'm sending the can to Jimmie Price to dust for prints . I need Bowman in Documents to fall on this carving . Then I need the Firearms and Toolmarks Section out here on the severed branch . I need to know what kind of cutting tool he used .
CRAWFORD: Is it weird ?

CRAWFORD: bur if we find him , the print as evidence will get a conviction , Hold on . What ?

GRAHAM: Who did he ask for ?
DR. BLOOM: Anybody want the rest of the cholesterol special ?
CRAWFORD: Thanks , no .
GRAHAM: so how do I play him , Sidney ?
DR. BLOOM: Compliment him . Tell him most people do n't have the intellectual capacity to understand what has happened , that sort of thing . If he 's paranoid , play into his grievance . Let him air it . If he 's picked you as an adversary and wants to gloat , give him what he 's after . A little at a time .
CRAWFORD: very little . If it 's all electronic switching we 'll need a minute for the trace .
SARAH: Special Agent Crawford 's office . Bill , call back on twenty-four four . We need to keep this line clear
CRAWFORD: Where the hell 's Graham !
SARAH: He went to the men 's room .
CRAWFORD: For Christ 's sake get him ! An assistant runs out . RING . Sarah 's anxious .
SARAH: Special Agent Crawford 's office . Could you hold on a second , I 'll see if I can find him .
GRAHAM: This is Will Graham . Can I help you ?
GRAHAM: Talk to them a few minutes and you can tell they do n't have the capacity to even understand what 's going on . Do you ?
CRAWFORD'S: ecstatic .
GRARAM: Will Graham , FBI .
GRAHAM: You tell me . You have a man in custody ?
LOUNDS: Will , listen
DR. CHILTON: Come in .
GUARD: Dr. Chilton .
DR. CHILTON: Yes ?
GUARD: When we were cleaning out Dr. Lector 's cell , he heard us coming and hid something in a book.. We got him out of there and dug around Dr. Chilton reacts .
DR. CHILTON: Do you have it ?
GUARD: Yeah . It 's right here .
GUARD: No .
SARAH: Special Agent Crawford 's office .
CRAWFORD: How 'd you know 'broken mirrors ? ' Bribe a cop ? Tell it to the U.S. Attorney , Lounds !
GRAHAM: What is it ?
SARAH: It 's a Dr. Chilton , sir . He says it 's urgent .
GRARAM: It 's Will Graham
GRAHAM: Where did you get it ? ! Graham waves Crawford to the other phone .
CRAWFORD: Run along to the police station , Freddie . We 'll talk to you when we get around to it Crawford punches into Dr. Chilton 's call .
DR. CHILTON: It 's written on toilet tissue . 'My dear Dr. Lecktor , I wanted to tell you I 'm delighted that you 've taken an interest in me . I know that you alone can understand what I 'm becoming . ' I know you alone understand the eality of the people who die to help me in these things , understand that they are only elements undergoing change to fuel the radiance of what I am becoming . Just as the source of light is urning . Mr. Graham , there 's a hole torn and punched our , then it says ' I have a complete collection of your press notices . f think of them as unfair . As unfair as mine . The `` Tooth Fairy . '' What could be more inappropriate . Investigator Graham interests me . Very purposeful locking . I hope we can correspond . There 's another piece missing here . I 'LL read the bottom part . 'After I hear back from you , I might send you something wet . Signed Avid Fan . It has teethmarks pressed in it at the bottom .
CBAWFORD: Sarah , order a chopper . I want the next thing smoking and I do n't care whose . Ours . DCPD . Or the Marines . Then call Documents . Tell them to scramble a team . I want everybody moving in five minutes . Dr. Chilton , please do not handle the note . I have a Documents team on the way to you by helicopter to pick it up .
GRAHAM: After we 've worked the note we want to replace it in Lecktor 's cell . I do n't want him to know we found it . Where 's Lector now ?
CRAWFORD: Have your building superintendent shut off the water and most of the lighting in Lecktor 's hall . Have him walk through carrying tools and being pissed off or something ,
BEVERLY KATZ: One hair , Graham . Maybe a thirty- second of an inch . A couple of lue grains . I 'll work it up . What else have you got ?
GRAHAM: Hair from Lecktor 's comb . Whiskers from an electric razor they let him use . This is hair from the cleaning man .
BOWMAN: How long do I have ?
CRAWFORD: Twenty minutes max .
GRAHAM: The main thing is how was Leckto to reply .
BOWMAN: That 's probably in the part Leckto tore out . At the top it says ' I hope we can correspond . ' And then the hole egins . It looks like Lecktor went over it with a felt tip pen and then folded it and pinched most of it away .
BOWMAN: You 're so sly , but so am I
GRAHAM: We know the Tooth Fairy reads the Tattler . The stuff about me and Lector ? I do n't know any othe paper that carried it
GRAHAM: Personal ads ? As they run out of the room
CRAWFORD: The Chicago office is running through all the personal ads in the Tattle ight now .
BOWMAN: When do they go to press ?
GRAHAM: In thirty-five minutes .
BOWMAN: Christ !
CRAWFORD: After we find Lecktor 's response , we substitute our own . Somewhere tomorrow night the Tooth Fairy will actually buy Tattler , looking fo Lecktor 's message . Here 's what he 'll find , Bill .
BILL: 'Dear Avid Fan inherit my mantle and surpass my achievements . Mementoes for you at Baltimore Central . Left luggage 72683 .
CRAWFORD: It 's a Secret Service letter drop and stakeout . He shows we take him . Anything from Chicago ?
SARAH: Not yet .
CRAWFORD: Let 's get to the physical .
PRICE: There was no print . I 'm here fo kicks .
BEVERLY KATZ: One whisker . Scale counts and core size match Hannibal Lecktor 's . So does color . The color 's different than the Tooth Fairy 's taken in Birmingham and Atlanta . Three blue grains and some dark flecks went to Brian 's end .
BRIAN ZELLAR: The grains are commercial granulated cleanser with chlorine . Must be from the cleaning man . There are several particles of dried blood . Not enough to type .
GRAHAM: Bowman ?
BOWMAN: It 's Snow White toilet paper . National distribution . Bowman sets up his photographs on an easel .
CRAWFORD: Issue the toilet paper tear as a The phone RINGS . Graham punches the speaker .
GRAHAM: Will Graham , Jack Crawford
CBAWFORD: Christ
CRAWFORD: twenty-eight minutes . Cryptography at Langley ?
SARAH: They got shot a Telex . They 're on if now
CRAWFORD: Book code ?
BOWMAN: 'One hundred prayers ' could be the page number . The paired numbers and the scriptural references could e line and letter . But what book ?
CBAWFORD: Not the Bible ?
BOWMAN: No . Galatians 15 2 ? Galatians has only six chapters . The same with Jonah 6 8 Jonah has fou chapters . Lecktor was n't using a Bible .
GRAHAM: Then the Tooth Fairy named the ook in the part Lecktor tore out .
BOWMAN: Right . What about sweating Lecktor ?
GRAHAM: They tried sodium amytal on him three years ago to find where he uried a Princeton student . He gave them a recipe for potato chip dip .
BOWMAN: it has to be a book the Tooth Fairy would know Lecktor has in his cell .
GRAHAM: He 'd know it from articles he 's ead about Lecktor
CRAWFORD: Willingham , when he tossed his cell , took Polaroids so they could get everything back in place
BOWMAN: Have him meet me with pictures of Lecktor 's books
CRAWFORD: Where ?
BOWMAN: Library of Congress . Bowman 's our the door .
GRAHAM: Twenty-five minutes . We wo n't make it in time .
CRAWFORD: We let Lecktor 's message run as is and decode it after . Or we pull it , work our the code and put ours in next week .
GRAHAM: Can we still get Lecktor 's message out of the paper ?
CRAWFORD: Yes . And I 'm leery of running Lecktor 's message without knowing what it says .
GRAHAM: And if we pull it , we lose a week We only have two to the next full moon .
CRAWFORD: It 's your call , Will . What do we do ?
GRAHAM: Run it .
CRAWFORD: What if it encourages the Tooth Fairy to do something besides write ?
GRAHAM: We will feel sick for a very long time .
KEVIN: Mom . ..
MOLLY: What time is it ?
KEVIN: Mom , someone 's outside . There 's noises
TROOPER: Are you all right , ma'am ?
MOLLY: Yes . Why ? What 's going on
MOLLY: Who decorated this place , Richard Nixon ?
GRAHAM: sorry , Molly . I 'm sorry this happened to you .
MOLLY: You did n't do it to me , Will ; it 's happened to us . And if I survive the wallpape we 'll be okay He 's after you now , is n't he ?
GRAHAM: It 's a precaution Why do n't you run down to the bay . They got a swimming float .
KEVIN: I 'll hang around in here . I 'll just be in the kitchen , Mom
GRAHAM: What is he ? Afraid to leave you alone with me now ? ' He read the Tattler piece , did n't he ?
MOLLY: He did n't know you had been in a mental institution . Be asked me if I knew . I said yes . I wanted to talk to him . He said he wanted to bring it up to you . Face to face .
GRAHAM: Good for him . Thanks a lot , Freddie ! Kevin . We 're going grocery shopping .
KEVIN: Is there anything I need to know to see about Mom ?
GRAHAM: No . You 're very well-protected . No one can find our where you are .
KEVIN: Barry 's mom had this newspaper . It said you killed the guy in Minnesota and were in a mental hospital . Is it true ?
GBAHAM: Yes .
KEVIN: I figured I 'd ask you
KEVIN: I told my dad before he died , I 'd take care of Mom . And I 'll do it . This guy wants to kill you ?
GRAHAM: We do n't know that .
KEVIN: Are you gon na kill him ?
GRAHAM: No . It 's just my job to find him . I was in the hospital after Garrett Jacob Hobbs .
KEVIN: How did it happen ?
GRAHAM: Hobbs was insane . He was attacking college girls and he killed them .
KEVIN: How ?
GRAHAM: With a knife .
KEVIN: You went in the apartment ?
GRAHAM: Yes . Hobbs had one of his daughters from behind . He was cutting her . I shot him .
KEVIN: Did the girl die ?
GRAHAM: No .
KEVIN: She got all right ?
GRAHAM: after a while .
KEVIN: And Hobbs died ?
GRAHAM: yes .
KEVIN: Killing somebody feels that bad ?
GRAHAM: Kevin it 's the ugliest thing in the world .
KEVIN: What kind of coffee do you like ?
GRAHAM: Huh ?
KEVIN: You like that Colombian stuff , do n't you ?
MOLLY: It 's hard to have anything , is n't it ? Rare to get it , hard to keep it . This is a damn slippery planet .
GRAHAM: Slick as hell .
MOLLY: You remember when we first met ? And were together alone in that oom . And the exhilaration was too much to hold on to . And then something flickered across you face like a shadow and I asked you what was wrong ?
GRAHAM: I remember .
MOLLY: Do you remember what you said ?
GRAHAM: Yes . I said this is too good to live Molly stares into his eyes .
MOLLY: Time is luck , Will . I know the value of our days
CRAWFORD: I need to talk to you about Will Graham .
BLOOM: What about him ?
CRAWFORD: I need to ask you questions of a psychological nature .
BLOOM: Remember when you asked for a study on him , I refused . Same goes for now .
CRAWFORD: That was Peterson upstairs .
BLOOM: It was you who did the asking .
CRAWFORD: He does n't think you run mind games on him .
BLOOM: I would n't presume to try .
CRAWFORD: You 're never alone in a room with Graham , are you ? You 're smooth about it , but you 're never one-on- one with him . Why 's that ? Do you think he 's psychic ?
BLOOM: He 's an eideteker . He has almost total recall . But I do n't think he 's psychic . What he has it empathy and projection He can assume you point of view and mine.. , and some other points of view that scare and sicken him .
CRAWFORD: Why are n't you ever alone with him ?
BLOOM: Because I 'm professionally concerned about him . And he 'd pick up on that . He 's fast . He hates being prodded and poked . So do I . What do you want ?
CRAWFORD: His nervous breakdown followed Hobbs . Could he kill again if he had to save his life ? Or would he hesitate ?
BLOOM: I 'll tell you the events . The psychology 's none of your business . Hobbs was trying to cut his eleven- year-old daughter 's throat . Graham shot him with his .38 six times . Hobbs still did n't go down . He had to wade in
CRAWFORD: That 's when it happened ?
BLOOM: No . It happened when Graham went to see Hobbs ' daughter four months later in the hospital . She saved her carotid artery.. , but lost three fingers and her larynx . She was connected up to a voice box . When Graham went to see her , she asked him through the speaker 'Why did you have to kill my daddy ? ' That 's when Graham had his nervous eakdown .
CRAWFORD: What 's the bottom line ?
BLOOM: If he pushes too deep into our boy 's mind-set , he may destroy himself . What are you planning , Jack ?
CRAWFORD: Could he handle a direct contact ?
BLOOM: I do n't recommend it .
GRAHAM: If the Tooth Fairy listens to Lecktor , he 'll come for me . So we 're going to set me up as bait to draw him out . Give him a clean shot .
GXAHAM: I 'll use Lounds . Now Bloom 's surprised
GRAHAM: Sidney , he does n't read the `` Sunday Times literary supplement . He eads Lounds in the `` Tattler . '' And I want this over with Fast .
LOUNDS: How does he rate compared to Dr , Hannibal Lecktor ?
GRAHAM: He 's not as intelligent .
BLOOM: He may have an unconscious homosexual conflict . A fear of eing gay . He objects to the word 'fairy . ' Plus smeared bloodstains indicate that he put the shorts on Charles Leeds after he was dead . I believe he did this to emphasize his lack of interest in Mr , Leeds .
GRAHAM: The killer has sexually molested all his male victims . He is a homosexual and impotent with persons of the opposite sex . Our forensic psychologists have projected he may have been the product of an incestuous home life . And probably had sexual relations with his mother Crawford stifles a laugh
LOUNDS: How long will you stay in Washington ?
GBAHAM: Until we 've taken out the Tooth Fairy .
GRAHAM: All right . Let 's shoot the pictures .
LOUNDS: I want shots with me and Graham together . Graham reacts .
GRAHAM: Keep the motel sign across the street just slightly out of focus . He has to be able to read it , but it ca n't look too obvious .
CRAWFORD: Asian studies at Langley said the mark you found on the tree is a Chinese character considered a positive or a lucky sign in gambling . The character also appears on a mah-jongg piece . It means Red Dragon . That mean anything to you ?
GRAHAM: No .
SPURGEN: if he 's smart he 'll approach from the front , pass , and take you from the back . How well do you hear ?
GRAHAM: Pretty well .
SPURGEN: I 'm gon na spray your suit jackets . It 'll be invisible in this light , ut you 'll stand out like a zebra for us . They told me you checked out a .44 Charter Arms Bulldog .
GI AHAM: Yes .
SPURGEN: Good . You 'll load these , Eve fire them ?
GRAHAM: Glaser Safety Slugs ?
SPURGEN: commercially prohibited . Number Twelve shot in liquid Teflon in a copper casing . On impact it all opens up in the target . Expect the recoil . They 're hot loads . Body armor ?
GRAHAM: Kevlar Second Chance .
SPURGEN: I hope you have a second chance
GRAHAM: Because he 's gone for the head shot seven out of eight times '
SPURGEN: You got it .
GRAHAM: Let 's walk the route . As they start across the parking lot
NEWSSTAND OPERATOR: What is it ?
DOLLARHYDE: Me ?
NEWSSTAND OPERATOR: Yeah , you . Fuckin ' told you
DOLLARHYDE: You told me what ?
NEWSSTAND OPERATOR: You got a quarter comin ' back .
GRAHAM'S: eyes tighten .
GRAHAM: God-dammit ! ! !
RUNNER: Arrest dat sucker ! Crawford catches up to Graham
CRAWFORD: You okay ?
SPURGEN: It was a mistake . Sorry we
RUNNER: 'Sorry ' yo ' mama ! !
SPURGEN: Hold on ! We thought you were someone we 're trying to catch
RUNNER: Hold onto this ! ! I get dat cannon stuck up mah face ? ! Car dirt splattered up and down mah Calvin Kleins ? ! 'Catch somebody ? ! ' You could n't catch yo ' ass with yo ' right hand ! You lucky you muther-fuckers catch a cold ! Who the hell goin ' pay my cleanin ' bill ? Huh ? HUGE LAUGHTER which is coming from

LOUNDS: Yes .
DOLLARHYDE: Mrs. Jacobi after her changing . The Dragon rampant . Do you see ?
LOUNDS: Yes .
DOLLARHYDE: Freddie Lounds . Your photograph . Do you see ?
LOUNDS: Oh , God .
DOLLARHYDE: Do you see ?
LOUNDS: Please , no .
DOLLARHYDE: 'No ' what ?
LOUNDS: Not me .
DOLLARHYDE: Are you a man ?
LOUNDS: Yes .
DOLLARHYDE: Do you imply that I 'm a queer ?
LOUNDS: God , no .
DOLLARHYI E: Are you queer , Mr. Lounds ?
LOUNDS: No .
DOLLARHYDE: Before me you are a slug in the sun . You are privy to a great becoming and you recognize nothing . You are an ant in the afterbirth . It is your nature to do only one thing correctly tremble . Bur fea is not what you owe me . Lounds you and the others , YOU OWE ME AWE ! We have one more piece of work to do . Dollarhyde leaves . Lounds closes his eyes .
LOUNDS: Did n't take off the mask . Please , God , let him not take off the mask . If he comes back with it off , I 'm dead
DOLLARHYDE: Now you will read this into the tape recorder .
LOUNDS: ' I have had a great privilege . I have seen with wonder the strength of the Red Dragon . All I wrote about him efore was lies from Will Graham . He made me write them . Now I understand . 'Will Graham you will learn from my own lips how much you have to dread . Because I was forced to lie , he will e more merciful to me than to you . ' I will be a testament to the truth , now . About his work . About his becoming . '
DOLLARHYDE'S HAND: turns off the tape recorder .
DOLLARHYDE: You did very well . I apologize fo the crude images . Next time I 'll have film stock that does n't need lights .
LOUNDS: You 'll let me go now ?
DOLLARHYDE: You will tell the truth ?
LOUNDS: Absolutely ,
DOLLARHYDE: Good . We 'll seal your promise with
DOLLARHYDE: with a kiss .
LOUNDS: Go 'head and kill 'ee , you 'astard ! You rot in 'ell . rot in 'ell !
MOLLY: Can I have one of your cigarettes ?
GRAHAM: You have n't smoked in two years .
MOLLY: I 'd like one of your cigarettes , please .
GRAHAM: No .
MOLLY: Then why ?
GRAHAM: I wanted it over fast . It felt dirty to not tell you .
MOLLY: Can you quit ?
GRAHAM: No .
MOLLY: And where are things ?
GRAHAM: Where we 're at is nowhere . We have nothing . We 're running out of time . There is a long pause . Molly suspects
MOLLY: What will you do ?
GRAHAM: I have to go back to Birmingham .
MOLLY: Is Crawford going with you ?
GRAHAM: No . I have to be . in there alone . Maybe there 's something fo me if I know how he feels and thinks .
MOLLY: William you are going to make yourself Sick or get yourself killed . Graham says nothing .
GRAHAM: You should go to Montana . Stay with Kevin 's grandparents . They have n't seen him for a while . I 'll come and get you afterwards
MOLLY: Will…
GRAHAM: Molly . … I love you . And I 'm not really going to be fit to be with fo awhile
GBAHAM: Sidney I do n't understand him . We know he re-arranges the kids and husbands into a dead audience . To witness the act . We know he thinks the act is making him into something different . His 'becoming ' but I do n't know what it is he thinks he 's becoming . The answer is something to do with how he uses the mirrors . That 's what 's missing for me . why the mirrors ?
GRAHAM: And do what ? Read about the next family in the morning paper ? In my Monkey Ward safehouse 'cause I ca n't take my family home ? This ends when I make it over .
GRAHAM: I 'm sorry , too
WAITRESS: Excuse me ?
GRAHAM: Coffee
DOLLARHYDE: Ms. McClain , I 'm Francis Dollarhyde . I came about the low light level infrared film stock .
REBA: Can you give me an idea of the conditions
DOLLARHYDE: Shooting at maybe eight feet . I ca n't use any lights .
REBA: What 's being photographed ?
DOLLARHYDE: The activities of nocturnal animals .
REBA: When do you need it ?
DOLLARHYDE: In eight days .
REBA: Let me stick this in the black hole .
REBA: The 1000 C Infrared Sensitive Film must be handled in total darkness . I keep the samples straight by touch code . It 's still easier to handle than a 1200 series . Think it 'll do ?
DOLLARHYDE: It 'll do fine .
DANDRIDGE: Reba , dear , I 've got to fly . Mr. Dollarhyde , if it would n't be too much trouble could you help he home ?
REBA: I can 'help ' myself home , Ralph

REBA: It 's better if I rake your arm .
DOLLARHYDE: Tonic will be fine .
REBA: In the kitchen .
DOLLARHYDE: How did you come to Gateway ?
BEBA: They had to shape up their employment practices to keep this defense contract .
DOLLARHYDE: You worked out well .
REBA: You know you speak very well , although you avoid fricatives and sibilants in your speech . At the Riker Institute for the Blind . I trained in speech therapy for speech and hearing impaired children
REBA: I 'll probably go back to it someday .
DOLLARHYDE: Uh-huh . Silence . Reba hands him his drink .
REBA: May I touch your face ? I want to know if you 're smiling or frowning . I want to know if I should just shut up or not
RZBA: If I 've offended you , I did n't mean to . He still has her hand in his grasp .
DOLLARHYDE: I have to go now . He lets go of her hand .
REBA: Ready to tell me what kind of 'outing ' this is ?
DOLLARHYDE: It 's a surprise . Her head arcs back as she senses
REBA: Francis ? We 're at the zoo !
DR. WARFIELD: In two days we 're going to cap his tooth . Can you smell him ?
REBA: Yes !
DR. WARFIELD: Are you apprehensive ? Your protective and muscular gentleman over there is watching us like a cat .
REBA: No , no ! I want to .
DR. WARFIELD: All right , put your left hand on the edge of the table and you can explore with your right . I 'll be right here eside you .
DOLLARKYDE: I made you a gin and tonic . It 's by the side of the sofa
DOLLARHYDE: Yes , are you okay ? !

REBA: I 'm fine , Francis . Dollarhyde gets out .
DOLLARHYDE: Fill it up and check the oil , please .
ATTENDANT: You do n't like it ? You know what you can do about it
DOLLARHYDE: I ought to jam this in your chest , and drain your heart
GRAHAM: I arranged for him to have a phone . I have to call him in a few minutes .
GPAHAM: This is Will Graham . Dr. Chilton arranged for me to talk with Dr. Lecktor .
LECXTOR: I wanted to congratulate you for the job you did on Mr. Lounds . I admired it enormously . What a cunning boy you are . Will .
GRAHAM: What do you want ?
LECKTOR: You know Lounds 's enlightened me on one thing your confinement in the mental hospital . My attorney should have brought that our in court .
GRAHAM: I 'm worn out with you crazy sons-of- itches . If you 've got something to say , Lecktor , say it .
LECKTOR: I want to help you , Will . You 'd be more comfortable if you relaxed with yourself . We do n't invent ou natures , They 're issued to us . Along with our lungs and pancreas and everything else . Why fight it ?
GRAHAM: Fight what ?
LECKTOR: When you were so depressed afte you shot Mr. Garrett Jacob Hobbs to death , it was n't the act that got you down . Did n't you really feel so bad because killing him felt so good ? And why should n't it feel good ? ! It must feel good to God . God does it all the time !
GRAHAM: I do n't believe in God .
LECKTOR: You should , Will . God 's terrific ! He dropped a church roof on thirty- four of His worshippers in Texas last Wednesday night . Just as they were grovelling to Him and singing a hymn . Do n't you think that felt good ? He would n't begrudge you two measly murders .
GRAHAM: Why does it feel good ?
LECKTOR: It feels good because if you do as God does , enough times , you become as God is powerful Will Graham thinks about this .
CRAHAM: I see you there . I breathe in the perfume of this room . I am in the inner sanctum of a life . You will accept me . Take me into you .
DOLLARHYDE: No .
DOLLARHYDE: Reba
DANDRIDGE: There 's something on your face .
REBA: What was it ?
DANDRIDGE: Pollen .
REBA: Thanks for the ride .
DANDRIDGE: See you tomorrow . Reba walks into her apartment
REBA: Who is it ?
GRAHAM: He changes them into beings that accept him And he needs to see the acceptance , In the mirrors . I did n't understand the mirrors efore . It 's very important .
CRAWFORD: 'Changes ? '
GRAHAM: It 's a word . Killing them His delusion is if he sees himself accepted enough times , he will become as one who has the power to be accepted all the time . And he would record it somehow . So he can see himself received ove and over again
CRAWFORD: VTR , film , Polaroid , stills , what ?
GRAHAM: How do I know ? ! Graham is intent on the tape . Then

CRAWFORD: There 's some film cans in the fa corner of the room underneath one of the windows . Crawford is very quiet .
GRAHAM: What it 's going to say on the Jacobi film can is the same as it says on the Leeds ' film can Gateway Lab , St. Louis , Missouri .

GRAHAM: Have him peel the top label back .
CRAWPORD: See if there 's another label underneath . Crawford hears , Graham 's watching him .
GRAHAM: It does , does n't it ?

MR AARON: I 'm just saying I know you had a little help .
LISA: A lot of people did .
MR AARON: Be that as it may
LISA: I mean I 'll take it over again if you want , ut like , what would be the point ? It 's not like I 'm ever gon na actually need to know this stuff in my daily life
MR AARON: Well , Lisa , that 's just not necessarily true . Have n't you ever developed an interest in something you did n't initially think you were going to develop an interest in ?
LISA: Um , no , not really .
MR AARON: Oh no ?
LISA: No . I did some of it .

KLEIN: .So the President of the United States , William B. McKinley , authorized the use of private detectives to break the strike , and they went out there and shot them down ! Just like they did in Virginia , just like they did in Pennsylvania . Because they did not care ! They did not care !
LEWIS: And that 's basically it-That 's basically all there is to say .
KLEIN: All right ? Go ahead , uhhhhh Becky .

KLEIN: I do n't know , Becky . I think that 's a good question . What do you think ? You . Lionel . What do you think ? Did we ever have a good President ?
LIONEL: UmI do n't know . I guess most of them have just been totally corrupt .
LISA: Can I just say , I 'm not necessarily like a ig fan of all the Presidents of the United States , especially the current one , but I still do n't think its necessarily all that useful to categorize every President as universally corrupt , because that just seems very general to me . Especially if you 're going to judge them by the standard of whatever they 're supposed to traditionally be like in some mythical version of America that probably neve existed to begin with .
ANTHONY: Lisa has raised a salient point . There are some laughs from the class .

LISA: I was gon na go look for a cowboy hat .
DARREN: Why would you want to buy a cowboy hat ?

DARREN: That is a definite possibility .
LISA: Anyway Thanks again

KLEIN LISA: OK OK Because it 's not same thing !
ANGIE: Yes it is !
KLEIN: Lionel ! Go ahead .
LIONEL: Yeah , I just want to ask like , why is OK to drop bombs on men , but it 's not OK to drop ombs on women and children ? Is n't that just reverse sexism ?
KLEIN: I do n't know . That 's an interesting point . I agree it 's a bullshit term .
LISA: This is totally stupid .
KLEIN: UhhhhhhMonica !
MONICA: Yeah , I think this whole class should apologize to Angie , because all she did was express her opinion about what he elatives in Syria think about the fact that we bombed the shit out of a practically medieval culture
ANGIE: Thank you ! 2nd Blue Revised 10/28/05 - Page 33
MONICA: and everybody started screaming at he like she was defending the Ku Klux Klan !
LISA: They are the Ku Klux Klan ! They like to throw acid in women 's faces !
TO LISA: But I 'm not even saying I disagree with you ! I 'm only saying I think it 's pathetic the way people in this class treated Angie just for saying something they do n't agree with .
KLEIN: Because that 's censorship , right ? Right ?
ANTHONY: That 's not technically LEWIS true . It 's censorship .
LISA: Oh my God , no it 's not !
JOAN: Ready ?
MITCHELL: We actually work outta Highway One ? Up in the Bronx ? So for somethin ' like this we just borrow a local precinct
JOAN: Uh huh
LISA: Yes .
MITCHELL: OK , just describe what you saw to me in your own words ?
LISA: She just stepped out in the street ?
LISA: How are you ?
KARL: I 'm great . I 'm looking at a beautiful sunset over the ocean . Doing a little work . . .How are you ?
LISA: I 'm OK .
KARL: Practicing your horseback riding ?
LAUGHS: Oh yeah , I 'm really riding a lot . I 'm gettin ' these really bad saddle sores .
_ KARL: OK. Well . I would actually seriously ecommend you go over to , uh , to Claremont Stables and see about getting some lessons .
LISA: No , I was actually really thinking about doing that
KARL: So how 's everything going ? How 's school ?
LISA: School 's OK . I 'm kind of fucking up in geometry
LISA: But my teacher 's really cool . So I guess it 's not too serious
KARL: Yeah . Math was never my strong suit either .
LISA: Well , I am definitely following in you footsteps in that regard-How are you ?
KARL: I 'm fine . I 'm good . Things are picking up a little bit , which is good . How 's the oyfriend situation ?
LISA: Oh the same . They 're all kind of the same .
KARL: Uh huh ? Well , next time you come out here I 'll try to hook you up with some more interesting people than you seem to be meeting at the moment .
LISA: Thanks , Dad , I do n't really go for the California type .
KARL: Well I do n't either , per se . It somewhat depends on who it is , obviously
LISA: Hard to argue with . I think I 'll stop generalizing , now !
KARL: OK. Well , that 's about all on my end , babe . I 'll give you a call in a week or two . Give my love to Curtis , and say hello to you Mom .
LISA: Bye Dad .
JOAN: It 's true . Two years of college . Two years at the magazine . Two years with you .
JOAN: What did you think of the play ?
LISA: It was OK . Silence .
PAUL: Yeah , like I would be in a movie , only I would be doing exactly what I 'm doing right now like I 'd be sitting here smoking a cigarette , and I 'd have my feet up on . the desk , but the camera would be on me and I 'd just be acting , except I would n't do anything differently from how I 'm doing it ight now .
BECKY: I still do n't get why you did n't even audition . You 're such a good singer .
LISA: I still might do lights or something . But I 'm not gon na make a fuckin ' ass out of myself parading around in a play so I can ask everyone how great I was for three years afterwards like my fuck-ass mother .
GIRLS: What ? Really ? Are you kidding ?
LISA: Check out my boots .
GIRLS: Oh my God ! What happened ? Where were you ? What did you see , etc ?
JOAN: You do know I have two kids , right ?
RAMON: Yes . I 'd like to meet them .
JOAN: You are really smooth .
RAMON: I would love to meet your kids . I have two oys myself . I 'm not smooth . Would you like to have a nightcap ?
JOAN: Oh , God .
BECKY: Are you aware that things have gotten to the point where I now have to hear things about you from other people and I ca n't even correct them because I no longer have any first-hand information about you myself ?
LISA: What are you talking about ?
BECKY: Nothing . I just feel like we used to be eally close like , up until a few days ago . And I 'm not really getting that from you anymore .
LISA: Becky . Give me a break . Pause .
BECKY: I ca n't believe you just said that to me . That was really hard for me to say , and that 's you response ?
LISA: Can we just go please ?
SARCASTIC: Fine . Would you like to smoke any more of my pot before we leave or have you had as much as you want now ?
SARCASTIC BACK: Oh , I 'd like to have a little bit more please .
BECKY: Fine . Get fuckin ' out of my house !
LISA: Fine . But this is totally stupid because we 're both going to the same party .
PAUL: You do n't have to be cool . All youhaveto do is snort it up your nose .
LISA: I 'll try ! He gives her the spoon . She snorts it .
PAUL: And then you wan na do the other nostril ecause you always want to be symmetrical . Very important .
LISA: You are so funny ! So what do we do now ?
PAUL: Now we make out .
LISA: Paul ! What about your girlfriend ?
PAUL: I 'm sorry . It just sounded like you just asked me about my girlfriend .
LISA: Oh , never mind
PAUL: You 're not serious .
LISA: Oh No . He moves his hand back . She lets him .
DARREN: Not really .
LISA: I guess I 'm not very consistent .
DARREN: I do n't mind . He kisses her again . She draws back slightly .
JOAN: Yes ! Fine ! Be out in a sec .
MR AARON: Yes , Becky ? Um Lisa ?
LISA: Are you still mad at me about the test ?
MR AARON: What 's going on , Lisa ?
LISA: .Because maybe my mother is right , and the bus driver is completely devastated as it is . And I 'm just gon na be this little ich girl who calls up the cops to ease he conscience , and then ends up ruining somebody 's life , when I 'm the one who was distracting him in the first place .
MR AARON: What does your being rich have to do with anything ?
LISA: You know what I mean .
MR AARON: OKBut I still do n't see what any of that has to do with what you do or do n't want to tell the investigating officers about the accident you witnessed .
LISA: Nothing , I guess . I 'm sorry . When you 're aised to be a knee-jerk Liberal you tend to think about these things . Lionel and a girl open the door .
MR AARON: Lionel ? Tamara ? It 's gon na be five minutes .
LIONEL: I just thought you 'd want to know there 's like a lot of people out here and it 's getting kind of hard to breathe .
MR AARON: You better close that door now , Lionel . Lionel closes the door .
LISA: I 'd do that . Mr Aaron sighs a little .
JOAN: Does this-make me look fat ?
LISA: Um , a little .
JOAN: Well , there 's nothing I can do about it .
LISA: Where are you going ?
JOAN: The opera !
LISA: Why are you going to the opera ?
JOAN: It turns out he 's a really big opera fan ! Anyway , do n't you think it 's kind of fun ? We should all go sometime .
LISA: Uh , no thanks .
JOAN: Why not ? I bet you 'd like it .
LISA: I do n't like that kind of singing .
JOAN: But you like classical music .
LISA: Yes . That 's true . But I do n't like opera singing .
JOAN: Yeah . I know what you mean . But it 's not all like that . You like The Magic Flute .
LISA: OK . I guess I 'm wrong . I guess I do like opera singing . I just did n't realize it .
JOAN: What is the matter with you ?
LISA: Nothing at all ! Why are you pushing this ? I do n't want to go to the opera !
JOAN: Yes ! OK ! It 's called an invitation . I 'm not pushing anything ! All you have say is `` No thanks ! ''
LISA: I did ! And then you were like , `` Why not ? '' So then I told you , and then you started like , debating me ! Like you assume I 've never thought this through for myself ! Which I have ! Many times !
JOAN: OK , well , that was a really Contemptuous assumption on my part . I do n't actually like the opera that much myself . But I 'm trying to expand my mind . Maybe that 's wrong ! I 'm sorry . I guess I 'm a little nervous about you guys meeting Ramon .
LISA: Why ? What 's the big deal ? Why are you so influenced by what me and Curtis think ? What Curtis and I think .
JOAN: Because obviously if I 'm seeing somebody new it would important to me that you guys would like him and that he like you . Why would n't I be nervous about that ?
LISA: I guess you would . Withdrawn .
JOAN: HeyWhy does everything I say annoy you ?
LISA: Jesus Christ , I 'm just sitting here !
JOAN: Here you be me , and say anything , and I 'll espond the way you 've been responding to me this whole conversation .
LISA: No !
JOAN: Go ahead say something to LISA
LISA: Because it 's dumb ! I 'm horrible ! I get you point !
LIKE LISA: `` OK , uh , whatever . ''
LISA: Was that supposed to be an imitation of me ?
JOAN: Are you coming to my opening night ?
LISA: I will if I have to . Pause .
JOAN: You 're a little cunt , do you know that ?
LISA: Yes . You 're a big cunt .
JOAN: OK. Let 's not start talking to each othe that way .
LISA: You just called me a cunt , Mom !
JOAN: OK , I 'm sorry I said that . LISA But if you 're really Why ? It 's refreshing !
JOAN: If you 're really saying you 're not aware that you 've been really annoyed with me , o eally irritable with me and it does n't matter if_I express it exactly accurately you know what I 'm trying to say !
LISA: Not really .
JOAN: if you 're saying you 're completely unaware of that , then I have to say I do n't think you 're being honest about it . Now maybe I 'm doing something really horrible to you without being aware of it , but I have a show opening in two weeks , I 'm very nervous about it , I 'm seeing a new person and I 'm obviously anxious about you and Curtis liking him whether you think I should be or not ! you were involved in a horrible traumatic accident , you 're going on this crazy horseback riding trip with your father
LISA: Oh my God !
JOAN: which sounds like a recipe for disaste to me ! And on top of everything else , Lisa , ever since I told you about Ramon you 've een treating me like I 'm insane !
LISA: Um , I think you 're exaggerating slightly .
JOAN: Now what am I supposed to do ? !
JOAN: What am I supposed to do ? !
LISA: Just stop whining about everything ! It does n't matter . Norte of that matters at all ! You 've been in a million plays , you always get freaked out because of what some dumb critic is gon na say about your dum play , I do n't frankly give a shit about Ramon or who you 're going out with this week
JOAN: I never go out with anyone ! LISA
LISA: and you want to know something else , Mom ? There are more important problems in the world than our relationship ! There 's a whole city out there full of people who are dying ! So who cares if I like your fucking oyfriend ? It 's so trivial ! Why are you othering me about all this ? It does n't matter ! ! !
JOAN: Well should I have him come up now ? Or should I have him wait downstairs ?
LISA: Do whatever you want . I do n't care !
JOAN: I do n't even know what we 're talking about .
LISA: I know you do n't . That 's the problem .
JOAN: Oh give me a break .
RAMON: Everything is all right ?
JOAN: Oh , yeah . I 'm so excited to be going to the opera ! I do n't think I 've really gone more than one or two times !
RAMON: Well , I wish it was n't Norma but it 's still fun to go .
JOAN: No I do n't mean that . I just meant would n't it be funny if we just walked into one of the other events , like if we just went to see the Daniel Goldfarb play instead .
RAMON: I think you will enjoy this .
JOAN: It 's beautiful !
RAMON: Shhh .
PAUL: Yo .
LISA: Hey , Paul . Goldenrod Revised 10/23/05 - Page 49

PAUL: Seeing some questionable movies . Not deciding where to go to college
LISA: Sounds good SoI was just thinkingThis is gon na sound really queer , butby any chance would you want to meet somewhere and like , take away my virginity ?
PAUL: Umall right .
LISA: Really ? God , I 'm so flattered .
PAUL: To what do I owe this inconceivable honor ?
LISA: Actually it 's because of my deep passionate feelings for you , Paul .
PAUL: That 's pretty much what I figured So , do you want to come over here ? Should I come over there ?
LISA: Well , my Mom just went out for the eveningExcept my little brother 's getting dropped off at some point , come to think of it , so I 'm actually supposed to be here when he gets home .
PAUL: All right . Do you want to give me your address ?
LISA: It 's 252 West 85th Street Green Revised 10/7/05 - Page 50

DARREN: I 've just never known you to be so devoted to your studies before .
LISA: Well , I do n't want to fail Humanities .
DARREN: You 're not gon na fail Humanities .
LISA: No , probably not .

PAUL: Hey .
LISA: Hey , come in . She steps aside . He passes her and comes in .
PAUL: I think I-just alienated one of you neighbors by smoking in the elevator .
LISA: Oh really ? What did they say ?
PAUL: She basically said there was no smoking in the elevator .
LISA: That 's original
PAUL: Very livable .
LISA: We like itMy Mom has n't read any of these books , by the way .
PAUL: Have you ?
LISA: Some of them . Not all of them .
PAUL: This book is a very cool book .
LISA: Yeah , I think the Third Reich may be a little bit too much for me right now .
PAUL: It 's pretty hard to put down once you get started . -
LISA: Do you want anything to drink ?
PAUL: I 'd take a beer .
LISA: OK , I have no idea where the bottle opene is . -
PAUL: Here , lem me have them .
LISA: Thanks .
PAUL: Whoops . I think I just permanently damaged your kitchen counter . Sorry .
LISA: Oh that 's OK. Do n't worry about it .
PAUL: Wo n't your `` Mother '' be `` Upset ? ''
LISA: How come everything you say always sounds so ironic ? You do n't even have to do anything and it just comes out sounding like , totally ironic and funny .
PAUL: It 's just a gift . She laughs nervously . They drink beer .
LISA: Sodo you want to see my room ?
PAUL: Sure .
LISA: This is my room . Ta da .
PAUL: Very nice .
LISA: And these are my stuffed animals .
PAUL: Always important to meet the stuffed animals .
LISA: These are some drawings I didNot that I should be showing them to you , because I know you 're like a really good artist , ight ?
PAUL: I would like to be a really good artist . At this point I think it would be more accurate to say I 'm good at drawing .
LISA: Yeah , I just do it for fun . But I 've always eally liked it He looks at her pictures .
PAUL: Yes ?
LISA: This is probably gon na sound very immature , ut how can you be so relaxed , knowing what we 're about to do ? Or is it just like no ig deal to you ? OK , that was a eally stupid question and I 'm like totally embarrassed right now . I 'm actually more embarrassed than I 've ever been in my life . If you want to go home now that 's totally
PAUL: Easy there . Do n't be embarrassed . It 's asically like , the world 's greatest activity , but it 's not actually worth getting nervous about .
LISA: Yeah I do n't usually get nervous because I think it 's worth it I usually get nervous ecause I ca n't help the way I feel . Although I do think that if anything is worth getting nervous about , it 's this . But maybe that 's just really idealistic of me .
PAUL: There is that philosophy .
LISA: You are so funny !
PAUL: Do you have an ashtray ?
LISA: Oh you can just chuck it out the window .
PAUL: I was thinking about it , yeah .
LISA: And am I being really dorky right now ?
PAUL: You 're not suave .
LISA: I 'm sorry . I guess I 'm a little nervous . Please ignore .
PAUL: Do n't be nervous . I promise this is gon na e a great experience for you . You 're gon na have like four , five hundred orgasms at least . He kisses her . They make out .
LISA: What are you like the nicest guy in the world ?
PAUL: No
LISA: Like that ?
PAUL: Yes
LISA: in I supposed to go really fast at the end or something ?
PAUL: Yeah , but we 're gon na move on before
LISA: You do n't have to do that .
LISA: Do n't do that , OK ? I 'm just embarrassed . Let me do it to you .
PAUL: All right .
LISA: Yeah .
PAUL: OK . This is a little tricky It 's probably gon na hurt a little , at first , but then it 's gon na get betterJust be patient . There are certain technical difficulties on my end that have to be addressed or it 's not gon na happen .
LISA: OK You sound insane . They laugh .
PAUL: OK , ready ?
SUDDENLY FRIGHTENED: Yeah .
IN PAIN: Mm hm .
PAUL: OK , hang on

LISA: Nothing .
PAUL: OK hold on Shit
LISA: What ?
PAUL: OK , one second Ohh ! Sorry Sorry
LISA: Did any of it get inside me ?
PAUL: I do n't know .
FEELING AROUND: Yeah . It definitely did .
PAUL: Honest to God ? It 's probably OK . The odds are overwhelmingly that it 's OK. O.C . the doorbell rings .
LISA: That 's my little brother .
CURTIS: Hi .
PAUL: Hey .
LISA: Hey . Can I have a drag ? Thanks .
PAUL: Why ? Why ? Because we did n't use birth control ?
LISA: I guess so .
PAUL: It was at the ready
LISA: Well , I do n't really want to get AIDS , you know ? And I really do n't want to have an abortion , because I know when you have one at my age it , can be really hard to get pregnant later on , and I definitely want to have children some day .
LISA: Oh , the `` I 'm A Total Fucking Moron '' Pill ?
PAUL: Wellthat 's the Canadian name .
LISA: Yes . I prefer not to put too many chemicals inside my body if I can avoid it . I 'm sure it 's fineOr not !
PAUL: Try to listen to me . Right about now is when you 're traditionally supposed to freak out . So why do n't you just not ? You 're not gon na get AIDS , because I do n't have AIDS
LISA: How do you know ? Have you been tested ?
PAUL: No , but I 'm pretty sure I do n't have it , ecause of my demographic . And the odds are you 're probably not gon na have to have an abortion either . And since this was you first time , it might as well be a basically happy memory instead of a shitty one .
LISA: I 'm sorry . I 'm not completely in control of my emotions . AnywayThank you fo deflowering me .
PAUL: You 're welcome .
LISA: Did it freak you out that I said I love you ?
PAUL: NoIt did n't freak me out .
LISA: You do n't have to say it back , because I know you probably have like no feelings at all for me .
PAUL: I think I_just proved I have some feelings for you .
LISA: You should probably go now
PAUL: Yo .
LISA: That 's my brother .
PAUL: What 's up ?
CURTIS: Hi . Lisa walks Paul to the front door .
JOAN: Oh , I loved it ! It was so exciting !
RAMON ': Good ! We should go again !
JOAN: But how about those people yelling `` Bravi ! '' and `` Brava ! ''
RAMON: How do you mean ?
JOAN: It 's just so pretentious . `` Bravi ! '' `` Bravi ! '' Why ca n't they just say `` Bravo ? ''
RAMON: Well , it 's the plural .
JOAN: I know
RAMON: It 's the plural of `` bravo . '' It 's what they say to acknowledge the ensemble .
JOAN: No , I know , I know it 's correct , it just do n't you think there was something a little pretentious about those people ?
RAMON: Pretentious ?
JOAN: I do n't mean they did n't really enjoy itBut you know how you can really be enjoying something but you 're also kind of looking around out of the corner of you eye because you know people are watching you enjoy it ? Does that make sense at all ?
RAMON: Yes , but I would n't say that it was pretentious . In Italian you say `` Bravo '' fo a man and `` Brava '' for a woman , and `` Bravi '' for the whole company .
JOAN: Uh huh ? OK , I see what you mean .
RAMON: You use the masculine for the male singe and the feminine for the female singer .
JOAN: YeahAnyway , I really enjoyed it . Thank you .
RAMON: We 'll have to go again .
JOAN: It was so glamorous !
SINGS: `` My time of day is the dark time ''
LISA: Cue thirty-six , go .
MATTHEW: Why are we stopping ?
GARY: Now I know there 's been a lot of shit going on between a lot of the people in this oom..But I wan na tell you something You 've worked too fucking hard for this show to be derailed now by the kind of ullshit I know has been going on around here . Now , I 'll bet you there 's not one person working on this show who has n't got somebody they want to say something to , including me . So I 'm gon na start . Matthew ?
SLOWLY: By `` Matthew , '' I assume you mean me ?
GARY: Yes . I mean you .
MATTHEW: Yes ?
GARY: You are probably one of the most talented kids who 's ever performed at this school . But you 're too Goddamn lazy , you think you can just waltz through this part , and it 's pissing me off . Because this show can not come together until you learn your fucking lines . OK ? _
MATTHEW: So you 'd like me to memorize them . Everyone laughs .
GARY: Yes , I 'd like you to memorize them ! Now . Your turn !
MATTHEW: But I 'm not mad at anyone . I just want everyone to think I 'm a great guy . Everyone laughs .
LISA: But I 'm jealous of you
BECKY: Why would you be jealous of me !
LISA: Because of everything ! 'Cause you always get such good grades and your family neve has to worry about money , and your parents are still together , and I 'm really jealous of your other friends !
BECKY: Well , I 'm really sorry if I hurt you !
LISA: Me too !
WITH UNDERSTANDING: I know . I know .
IN TEARS: and it 's like I ca n't even talk to you about it because I hurt you so bad !
DARREN: Yes you can . Of course you can . You can talk to me about anything .
LISA: I do n't love anybody more than you ! You 're practically my best friend !
DARREN: I love you too . I really do ! They hug and cry . LESLIE raises her hand .
GARY: Leslie ?
LESLIE: Can I just say , I think this show is like two and a half seconds away from being fucking amazing , and if we could all just work together , instead of being AT each other all the time , I think we could all just be incredible .
ANGIE: Yeah . Yeah . I 'm gon na say it . I feel really fucked over by some of the people in this room . I 'm not saying I 'm not gon na do my job , but for some reason , a lot of the actors in this show seem to think that this whole show is about them . And I think I speak for a lot of the techies when I say that I feel really unappreciated and asically fucked over . And I do n't know if I can get over it . I do n't . That 's all .
GARY: Yes , Paul ?
PAUL: Yeah , I 'm just playing in the band , you know ? This is hicrh school . You know ? I do n't really feel a strong need to like , all be on the same team with everybody . I just want to come to rehearsals , do the show , go up on the roof and smoke some pot , and then like , go on home . I do n't really wan na cry and hug anybody . There are laughs and some cheers .
GARY: Oh you wan na hug me a little , do n't you Paul ?
PAUL: OK , Gary , man , I 'll give you a little hug . No kissin ' though .
ON PHONE: Accident Investigation . Detective Mitchell .
LISA: Hi , my name-is Lisa Cohen . I was a witness in a bus accident case a few weeks ago
MITCHELL: Yeah , hi , Lisa , what can I do for you ?
LISA: Well , this is probably gon na sound a little weird , but are you allowed to tell me how to get in touch with that woman 's family ? I 'm obviously probably too late to go to the funeral , but I really wanted to send some flowers or something .
MITCHELL: Yeah , I can
LISA: Or is that like classified information ?
MITCHELL: No no . Family 's been notifiedLemme see what I got .
LISA: She mentioned she had a daughter

LISA: Hi , my name is Lisa Cohen . You do n't know meI
ABIGAIL: Yes ? Hello ?
LISA: Hi . Sorry . Yeah . I was actually calling about your cousin , Monica Patterson ?
LISA: I was actually there when she had during the accident . I did n't know her , but I was the one who was with her when she died
LISA: Yeah . I was sort of holding her hand at the time
ABIGAIL: Yes ? What can I do for you ?
LISA: OK. Well , ummm , I saw her obituary in the paper , but I did n't see anything about a funeral . I assume they had one , because
ON "ASSUME": No . As far as I know they 're doing something or other next week . But
LISA: I 'm sorry and I was also wondering , she said something about her daughter ?
ABIGAIL LISA: No . Her daughter She wanted someone No Her 's daughter 's to get ahold of her ? not alive She I 'm sorry passed away quite a long time ago .
LISA: Oh my God . Was itWas she sick ? Or was
ABIGAIL: She had leukemia .
LISA: Oh my gosh . And do you mind if I ask Was her name Lisa ?
ABIGAIL: Yes ?
LISA: OK , see , that explains it . See , I think she thought
ABIGAIL: Could I just interrupt ? How did you get this number ?
LISA: Oh the police I asked the Accident Investigating investigator who to contact if I wanted to
ON "IF": Well they really should n't be giving out my number . This is harassment !
SHOCKED: I 'm sorry ! -I 'm not trying to harass
ABIGAIL: I have been getting calls about this fo three weeks ! One of Monica 's neighbors gave the police my number and all of a sudden I am the focal point for all these arrangements ! And I got ta tell you people , I did n't have any kind of relationship with Monica whatsoever , unless you want to count the fact that she held up my children 's inheritance for fifteen years . I guess we 're just supposed to forget about all that now . And I am more than willing . But the perso n you should be calling is Emily Morrison , who was Monica 's friend and is the person who has been dealing with all of this in New York . But it has nothing to do with me .
LISA: I 'm sorry ! I did n't really know who to
ABIGAIL: Now I can give you her number , but I would very much appreciate it if the calls would stop .
LISA: Yes Please . Can you hold on while I get a pen ?
ABIGAIL: Yes , all right .
EMILY: I guess it would be all right It 's only going to be a few close friends , and some clients I imagine
LISA: Oh so was she a lawyer ?
EMILY: Monica ? No . She was a social worker . She used to be , anyway . She had several careers .
LISA: Were you really good friends with her ?
EMILY: Yes I was .
JOAN: Where you going , sweetie ?
LISA: I 'm going to that woman 's funeral .
JOAN: Are you sure you do n't want me to come ?
LISA: Why ? I do n't even know her .
JOAN: I would be coming for you .
EMILY: Hi . Are you Lisa ?
LISA: Yeah . Thank you so much for letting me come .
EMILY: Why do n't you come on in ? We 're about to start . Do you want anything to drink ?
LISA: Oh Um no thanks .
EMILY: We have bad hors d'oeuvres and good hors d'oeuvres .
LISA: Oh - that 's quite all right , thank you .
EMILY: Well-thank you all for coming .
WOMAN MOURNER: Thank you for doing this , Emily .
THE MOURNERS: Yes , thank you , Emily .
EMILY: As you all know , Monica was not a religious woman . Anybody who ever had to sit through a wedding or a funeral with her knows how she felt about formal occasions . So Harry and Elise and I , when we were talking about this , decided we would just have everyone over and let.anyone who wanted to.talk . about Monica just talk about her . Maybe share some remembrances of her . Some of us know each other , some of us do n't . But we 're all here because we loved Monica . And ecause we want to pay tribute to her in a way that might conceivably not enrage her . Everyone laughs slightly .
2ND MOURNER: She sure did .
EMILY: So . Now I 've said my little piece . And now I want to talk a little bit about the first time we met . She was twenty one .
WOMAN MOURNER: It 's OK , Emily .
EMILY: I know ! And I was nineteen ! Even though it 's impossible for my children to believe I.was ever that young .
LISA: Emily , thank you so much for letting me be here .
EMILY: Do n't be silly , honey . You were sweet to come by .
LISA: Did n't she have any family ?
EMILY: No , she was the last one . Except for some cousins in Arizona . You talked to Abigail . She 's the one who gave you my number
LISA: Yeah
EMILY: Well , she 's a living nightmare . They neve got along at all .
WOMAN MOURNER: Excuse me . Good bye , Emily . Thank you so much for doing this .
EMILY: Listen . I still ca n't believe this is happening ! I mean what the fuck is wrong with her ?
WOMAN MOURNER: I do n't know !
EMILY: I do n't understand why she did n't kill herself when Lisa died ! And then Barry , and then after all that with her mother , and then her father , she gets hit by a fucking us ? It 's like a joke ! But that 's Monica . Always the worst luck . Always . OK , sweetheart . Thank you for coming . Please do n't stand there staring at me , OK ?
LISA: I 'm sorry ! I just wanted to say goodbye .
EMILY: It 's OK . Thank you for coming . You 're very sweet .
LISA: Goodbye .
WOMAN MOURNER: Goodbye . As Lisa-goes out she hears
EMILY: That 's a girl who was passing by at the time of the accident . She was right-there when she died , and she wanted to come to the funeral . I told her there was no funeral , but she wanted to come anyway . I would n't have done that at her age , would you ?
WOMAN MOURNER: No
LISA: No M A R E T T I .. What about Brooklyn ? . Thank you .
READING: `` We are to the gods as flies to wanton oys . They kill us for their sport . '' We are to the gods as flies to wanton boys . They kill us for their sport . '' What do you make of that ? Lisa ? Lisa ?
LISA: I do n't know .
JOHN: Take a stab . What do you think Shakespeare is saying about human suffering here ?
LISA: I do n't know . Sorry .
JOHN: You know what , Lisa ? That 's not good enough . That 's not good enough . Shakespeare wrote something What 's you esponse ? And do n't tell me you do n't have one because I do n't buy it .
LISA: I do n't really have a lot to say . It seems pretty self-evident to me .
JOHN: Matthew ?
MATTHEW: I think it is self-evident . I think he 's saying that human beings do n't mean any more to the gods than flies do to little oys who like to torture them for fun .
DARREN: Thank you , Matthew . Yeah , I agree . Only it 's not Shakespeare saying it It 's Gloucester . Maybe another character would have a different point of view .
JOHN: OK That 's a valid point . Just because Shakespeare has one of his characters say it does n't mean he personally agrees with it . Yes David ?
DAVID: Yeah , maybe Shakespeare is n't saying the gods do n't care about us . Maybe he 's saying there 's a higher consciousness that we ca n't see . That the gods ' perception of eality is so much more developed than ours that compared to their perception , ou perceptions are like comparing flies to
JOHN: OKI do n't think that 's what he 's getting atI think what he 's getting at here is a very dark view of the arbitrary nature of human suffering .
DAVID: But maybe he 's not . Maybe he 's comparing human consciousness to divine consciousness , and he 's saying that even though it seems to us that human suffering is just arbitrary , that 's just because we 're limited by our viewpoint .
JOHN: Well let 's look at the text . Let 's test David 's hypothesis . `` We are to the gods as flies to wanton boys . They kill us fo their sport . '' I have to agree with Matthew , that seems pretty unambiguous .
DAVID: Yeah , because he 's saying there 's a highe purpose that we ca n't see . He 's saying that what seems like them killing us for sport could just be because our consciousness is n't developed enough to see what the higher wisdom of their killing us is . 2nd Blue Revised 10/28/05 - Page 75
JOHN: OK , but I still do n't think that 's what he 's trying to say . Um
DAVID: No , like if you say they kill us for thei sport , when our perception of the gods is so meager that we ca n't even tell what they 're doing , then how can we be so arrogant as to think that they would bothe to kill us for their sport ?
LOST: I do n't know Um Monica ?
MONICA: I do n't think that 's what he 's saying at all . I think he 's saying the gods do n't give a shit about human beings and they just kill and torture us for fun
MATTHEW: Yes . Much like flies to wanton boys . Anybody ? Anybody ?
MONICA: Yeah1
DAVID: But if the gods ' consciousness is so much more developed than ours that we seem like flies to them , then how can we be sure what they have in mind for us or why they do anything ?
JOHN: David , I think you 've made your point . But it 's not what Shakespeare meant . Scholarly opinion is pretty consistent that he 's trying to say something about human suffering here
DAVID: Scholarly opinion
JOHN: And in this particular play what I think he 's trying to say is pretty black pretty bleak
DAVID: But what are you saying ? A thousand Frenchmen ca n't be wrong ? 2nd Blue Revised 10/28/05 - Page 76
JOHN: No , I 'm not saying that . But I would like to move on
DAVID: I think he is saying that , because he 's comparing human consciousness to flies , and he 's saying that we ca n't see the truth around us because our consciousness is undeveloped .
JOHN: No David , that 's not what Shakespeare meant ! He says it somewhere else in the play , but I do n't want to get hung up on this any more because it 's not what Shakespeare meant , and I would really like to move on . David laughs derisively .
LISA: Hi Dad .
KARL: Yeah ! Hi ! How 's everything been going ?
LISA: OK. How are you ?
KARL: Not too bad . Pretty good . I 'm sitting here listening to some music . Having a glass of delicious beer .
LISA: That sounds pleasant .
KARL: Yeah . Yeah . How are you ? How 's the oyfriend situation ?
LISA: Wellthere 's this one guy I sort of had something going with . But he kind of has a girlfriend , so
KARL: Uh huh ? 2nd Blue Revised 10/28/05 - Page 76A
LISA: I realize I 'm incredibly enthralling
KARL: You are . You 're a beautiful girl . And you 've got brains . That makes you dangerous .
LISA: Do n't forget mature .
KARL: Well I 'm hoping you 're not too mature .
LISA: NoDo n't worry .
KARL: OK good . That was a good answer , .
LISA: Anyway , I do think it 's a pretty long- standing relationship
KARL: OK , then you know what ? You do nothing . You do absolutely nothing . And one of two things will happen . Either he 's gon na start doing back flips to get your attention , o you 're gon na send him a crystal clea signal that if he does n't do back flips he 's not gon na get your attention . OK ?
LISA: Well , I think he already knows I like him .
KARL: Uh huh ? OK
LISA: .I think I might have spilled the eans on that one a little
KARL: That 's OK. Because now , if now you stop acknowledging him , you just suddenly give him nothing , he 's gon na go berserk . Unless he 's just not interested . In which case , you got ta take your lumps . OK ? Which is tough .
LISA: Well , thanks , Dad . I 'll be sure to try out the technique next time I see him .
KARL: Yeah . Lem me know what happens .
KARL: OK. Well , everything 's OK hereA little
LISA: Actually , Dad ? I definitely want to hea how things are with you in a minute , but I actually have something kind of serious I want to ask you about I 'm kind of soliciting people I respect-for their views on this
KARL: OK. What 's up ?
LISA: . so do you think I should go back to the police , or what ?
KARL: OK , well , first of all , I 'm very glad you told me . Second of all , I think you should let me call my friend who 's a lawyer , just to get some idea of what the ramifications would be .
LISA: You mean to protect myself before I go ack ?
KARL: There 's nothing wrong with knowing what you 're getting into . I 'm gon na call my friend Lorne , I want to see what he says .
ANNETTE LISA: Hey ! Actually , Dad ? Please do n't call anybody . KARL Seriously . I appreciate Hi babe . your taking charge and everything , but ANNETTE Hello ? Did you get my message ?
KARL: Um I got a message .
ANNETTE: About the flowers ? For my mother ?
KARL: I do n't know . Yes . Hold on . I 'm sorry , Annette just walked in .
LISA: That 's OK .
ANNETTE: Who are you talking to ?
KARL: I 'm It 's could I just
LISA: Anyway , I guess I would just like to know later that I would have done the right thing by myself , if you see what I mean . Because I do n't think I have so far .
KARL: Uh huh ?
ANNETTE LISA: Who is that ? Not that I 'm trying to make this woman 's KARL horrible death into my own
KARL: I 'm sorry , Lisa . Hold on one second .
TO ANNETTE: Yes .
ANNETTE: Will you please ask her if there 's anything we do n't know about that she wo n't eat ? Fo the trip ? Because I have to tell the ranch , ecause they do all the meals ahead of time
KARL: Yes I will We 're just in the middle of something .
ANNETTE: Karl , I was supposed to call them last week . You said you were gon na call her and you did n't . So then I called her , and she never called me back . So what do you want me to do ?
KARL: OK , you know what ? I want to talk about this , not right now .
ANNETTE: and if there 's anything she ca n't eat and they put it in the hampers , she 's not gon na have anything to eat . The last time she came out here we went to three different places and she could n't eat anything on the menu .
KARL: I 'm going to ask her . I will . We 're right in the middle of something .
ANNETTE: OK. Tell her I said hi .

MARETTI: On purpose ?

LISA: All right ! Wellthe way I remember the accident is that you were wearing this cowboy hat
MARETTI: Yes , it 's my cowboy hat that I wea sometimes to amuse myself on the bus , yes . I was probably wearing my cowboy hat , yes . What .
LISA: If you could just let me ! From my point of view , I was out that day trying to buy a cowboy hat , so I was waving at you , becase I was looking for one and you were kind of waving backAnd I know the police already decided it was No Fault , or No Criminality or whatever they call it
MARETTI: No Criminality , that 's right .
LISA: I guess partly because of what I told them . And I know I was distracting you , ut I did see the bus go through the red light . And that 's when it hit that woman .
MARETTI: OK . I 'm gettin ' a little confused ove here .
LISA: Only nobody said that to them . And I just wanted to like , acknowledge with you that that 's what happened .

MARETTI: Maybe I was wavin ' at you like , wavin ' to say , you know , `` Step away from the bus , '' if the bus was in motion , I would 've waved you away for your-own safety , but that 's all that would be . Yellow Revised 10/9/05 - Page 87
LISA: You do n't remember looking at me and waving at me ? Mrs. Maretti comes out again .
MARETTI: No . Not really . No .
LISA: Well I think we both remember something different .
MRS MARETTI: Your brother 's on the phone .
MARETTI: Tell him I 'll call him back . Mrs Maretti goes back inside .
LISA: I 'm not trying to get you in trouble .
MARETTI: I know you 're not , because you could n't get me in trouble . Uhhhh , there 's no criminality foundthe report is , uh , final . And that 's it .
LISA: So you 're just gon na leave it ?
MARETTI: I 'm gon na leave it , because that 's all that it was . If something else would have happened , I 'd take it to whatever that was . It was tragic , it was a tragedy . But there 's only a certain speed the brakes can eact . That 's a physical limitation of the machine . I do n't know what else to tell you . It was a shock . It 's shock . But that 's it . Ca n't bring her back . Can not ing her back .

LISA: I know that . But I lied .
MARETTI: You lied .
LISA: Yes . And I can understand if you do n't want to get in trouble , but .
MARETTI: Then how come nobody else saw it ?
LISA: I ca n't help what other people saw
MARETTI: You would think somebody else would see it .
LISA: I just know what I saw !
MARETTI: Then why did n't you say something right then ?
LISA: Because when they were asking me what happened it seemed like you were kind of looking at me like we were saying to each other , `` Let 's not say anything about what happened . ''
MARETTI: Oh , now I really do n't know what you 're talkin ' about .
LISA: I ca n't prove that you were doing that Mrs Maretti comes back outside .
MARETTI: What did I say anything to you ? Did I threaten you ?
LISA: No ! And I am not blaming you for any of this ! All I 'm saying is that I did n't eally tell the cops what happened , and I did n't want to go back without

And there 's nothin ' I-can do to ing her back !
LISA: I just want to say what really happened .
MARETTI: Hey do whatever you fuckin ' want .
MRS MARETTI: Gerry !
MARETTI: But those cops are gon na laugh in you fuckin ' face because this was not my fault !
LISA: It was both our fault .
MARETTI: What 'd you say ?
LISA: It was both our fault . Maretti scrambles in his pocket for a pen .
MARETTI: Yeah . Do n't say that to me.again without a lawyer . Gim me your phone number .

LISA: I do n't know why you 're Maretti turns and goes in the house .
MRS MARETTI: You know this was very traumatic for him !
FURIOUS: It 's almost as bad as getting your deg cut
MRS MARETTI: Does your mother know you 're here ?
LISA: Yes .
EMILY: Why did n't you say anything before ?
LISA: I guess I was afraid . I did n't know what to do.•
EMILY: You did n't know what to do ? The woman is killed right in front of you and you did n't know what to do ?
LISA: I know it does n't sound very impressive .
EMILY: Impressive ! All right I know you 're trying to do the right thing now . What does your mother say ?
LISA: My mother has n't really been that helpful .
EMILY: What do you mean ?
LISA: I mean she 's got a lot going on right now and she just has n't been that interested , I guess .
EMILY: What could she possibly have going on ?
LISA: Her show is opening .
EMILY: What do you mean , her show ? What show ?
LISA: She 's in a play .
EMILY: My friend is dead because some guy was looking at your ass and you lied to the police about it , and your mother ca n't be othered because she 's in a play ?
LISA: Well , it 's kind of a big deal for her . She has a really big part .
EMILY: I 'm sorry . I do n't know your mother , but , that is pretty shocking .
LISA: I guess she 's really worried about getting a bad review or something .
EMILY: OK . I 'm gon na talk to my friend who 's a lawyer , and I 'm gon na call Monica 's cousin - you talked to her And you 're gon na go talk to the police . Do you want me'to-go with you ?

LISA: I think I can handle this part myself .
EMILY: Oh , I am so angry . I am so angry .

LISA: No we ca n't forget it , because I ca n't take this anymore . What do you care what they say about you anyway ?
JOAN: I do n't . It 's just a lousy feeling . Ca n't you understand that ? If they wrote mean things about you in the newspaper you would n't like it . Even if you did n't agree with it , or base your self-esteem on it . Why ca n't you understand that ?
LISA: I do understand it , because we have this conversation every time ! You 're great in the play , you 're a great actress , everybody thinks you 're great , everything about you is great , you 're really really pretty
JOAN: Oh shut up .

SIMULTANEOUS: Even if you cause an accidental death , that 's right . For this to be a criminal offense , the law says you need two aggravating circumstances . Like he ran a red light and he was speeding . Or he ran a red light and he was
LISA: So he 's not liable to be prosecuted fo manslaughter ? Or second degree murder ?
MITCHELL: No . He could be charged with reckless driving , and fillip ' out a false police eport . Which , that 's no joke
LISA: That 's unbelievable ! What does he have to do ? Kill her on purpose ?
MITCHELL: Yes . Because that 's the definition of murder . Killin ' somebody on purpose . You 're not sayin ' he ran her over on purpose , are you ? Pause .
LISA: No . Pause .
MITCHELL: All , right , look . Lem me take anothe statement , and , uhWe'11 look into it ,
LISA: You 're kidding .
MITCHELL: No . I 'll go over it with my sergeant , probably pull this guy in again . Reinterview him . Put a little pressure on him . See what he says .
VERY GRATEFUL: Thank you ! Thank you .
BONNIE: OK , so we 're just gon na start with a_couple of simple stretches .
LISA: .Yeah , because the Central Park Conservatory or whatever it 's called put up about five hundred miles worth of these cheap shitty-looking fences all over the park . Which is totally antithetical to what the park was originally designed for . She exhales and hands Becky the joint .
BECKY: We are totally gon na miss the game . Oh my God it 's John ! It 's John !
LISA: Hi John .
BECKY: Hi John . Want some ? They giggle .
JOHN: Come on , guys . You ca n't be smokin ' a j. on your way to a school soccer game ! Now come on !
LISA: Sorry .
BECKY: We 're really sorry .
STAGE WHISPER: OK How about how he 's like , `` Smokin ' a j . '' Like , `` You ca n't be smokin ' a j . '' They all burst out laughing .
LISA: Hi , Mr Aaron !
MR AARON: How are you , Lisa ?
LISA: I 'm pretty damn good . How are you ?
MR AARON: I 'm all right , I 'm all right-Tell me something . Whatever happened with that situation ?
LISA: Oh•I 'm working on it . I 'll tell you all about it sometime Hey , what kind of a bike is that ?
MR AARON: Um , a Trek .
LISA: I 'm supposed to take a horseback riding trip with my father over Christmas break and I was just wondering , does it bear any esemblance to riding a bicycle ?
MR AARON: As far as I know , no , it does n't , no
LISA: But you must have ridden a lot of horses .
MR AARON: What makes you say so ?
LISA: Are n't you from Texas or Wyoming o someplace like that ?
MR AARON: Someplace like what ?
LISA: God , so what are you doing at a New York private school teaching geometry to a bunch of overprivileged liberal Jews ?
MR AARON: Is that a real question , or a Lisa question ?
LISA: What 's a Lisa question ?
MR AARON: A question designed to prolong the conversation without there being any particular interest in the actual answer ?
LISA: About half and half .
MR AARON: In that case
LISA: Before you go , I am actually thinking of getting one of these . Can I try it ? Just for one second ?
MR AARON: All right .
LISA: Thanks .
MR AARON: You want me to adjust the seat ?
LISA: No thanks . This actually feels really , eally good . God , I 'm kidding ! You are so easy to tease !
MR AARON: No !
LISA: Can I just ask you how is it possible that I am totally in love with you and you have almost no interest in me whatsoever ? It 's not like I 'd ever say anything if you eve deigned to like , you know , be with me .
MR AARON: Lisa !
LISA: I can tell you like me . It 's not like I 'm a virgin , if that 's what you 're worried about . I 'm not even close .
MR AARON: I ca n't even be having this conversation with you .
LISA: Yeah , you keep saying that , but I notice you 're still standing here .
MR AARON: You 're absolutely right . Goodbye . He gets on the bike .
LISA: It 's not my fault if I revere you as a god !
MR AARON: I 'll see you in class . We pull away with him as she watches him go .
JOAN: Hi . Where have you been ? I did n't know.if you wanted dinner .
LISA: Oh no thanks . I 'll order something .
JOAN: Someone named Emily called . And Detective Mitchell called from the Accident Investigation Squad . Is that the one you talked to ?
LISA: Yeah , did he say anything ?
JOAN: Just to call him back . What 's going on ? Did you ever go back and see him ?
LISA: I 'd rather not talk about it when you have one foot out the door . I 'll tell you later , if that 's OK .
JOAN: Of course it is . Who 's Emily ?
LISA: She 's the friend of the woman who died , the one who had the funeral
JOAN: Oh yeah , OK. Well , her number 's by the phone .
LISA: OK. How 's Ramon ?
JOAN: Oh God . I do n't know . I mean I really like him . He 's really nice .
LISA: Give him a chance , Mom , you just met-the guy .
JOAN: But do n't you know what I mean ? I just feel kind of lonely when I 'm with him . You know ?
LISA: You feel lonely when you 're with him ?
JOAN: Yeah . You never felt that way when you were with someone ?
LISA: I guess so . I feel that way all the time . You get used to it .
JOAN: Well I do n't know how serious I want to get with somebody who makes me feel that way .
LISA: So do n't get serious . That 's my advice . Pause .
JOAN: All right . I 'm gon na go .
LISA: Have a good show .
JOAN: Thank you . Goodbye Curtis !
NEIGHBOR: Hello !
SMILES: Hello .
NEIGHBOR: Congratulations on the show !
JOAN: Thank you .
NEIGHBOR: That was such a wonderful review ! And I read somewhere it might be going to Broadway ?
JOAN: Supposedly . In March .
NEIGHBOR: God ! Exciting !
JOAN: Yeah , it 's going well . Knock wood .
EMILY: Lisa , Dave is one of my best friends . He 's a terrific lawyer and if he does n't know what to do himself he 'll certainly know someone we can talk to .
LISA: OK , great .
EMILY: So Dave , just tell Lisa everything you told me , if you do n't mind repeating
DAVE: Not at all . I love to repeat myself .
LISA: Are you guys gon na order something ?
DAVE: When someone is killed it 's what you call a Wrongful Death Suit , which is a statutory case , which just means there 's a statute passed by the legislature which gives you the right to bring the case .
LISA: As opposed to what ?
DAVE: As opposed to common law , which is law made y judges . Which is why the damages are limited .
LISA: I do n't understand .
EMILY: Look , just skip that part . We do n't care about that .
LISA: I thought we were trying to get the police to arrest this guy !
DAVE: No the police are not , uh
DAVE: I 'm just telling you that even if they do , there is no way in this world they are gon na recommend to the DA that they charge this guy . That 's why
ON "THAT'S": So what can we do ?
DAVE: Well . I 'm
LISA: Sorry . Pink Revised 9/25/05 - Page 109
DAVE EMILY: That 's OK That 's OK , honey
DAVE: I 'm just getting to that . You ca n't do anything unless you 're a relative
EMILY: She did n't have any relatives , except fo those idiots in Arizona
ON "EXCEPT": or hang on a minute unless you 're executor of her estate
EMILY: I am the executor of her estate .
DAVE: which is Emily . I know .
EMILY: So good .
DAVE: Yes . This is good . Because the executor of the estate Cdn bring a Wrongful Death suit , ut the beneficiary has to be a relative . So let me explain about that . In a Wrongful Death suit you can sue for Pain and Suffering , Pecuniary Losses , Lose of Support or Services.. .And also what 's called Care , Comfort and Society like advice , counseling of the parent that the kids are n't gon na get anymore
LISA: You can really sue for that ?
DAVE: Yeah , and that 's probably what we would do ,
LISA: So I do n't understand . Who are we suing ? The bus driver ?
DAVE: Well , no , because the bus driver would n't have any money . You basically sue everybody and hope something sticks . The person who pays will be the MTA 's insurance company .
LISA: But do you think the driver would get fired ? Pink Revised 9/25/05 - Page 109A
DAVE: No . Not necessarily .
LISA: Even if all the facts came out at the trial ?
DAVE: Maybe . I do n't know .
EMILY: But how much could they be liable for ?
DAVE EMILY: It depends How badly do you think we could ever hurt them ?
DAVE: if she was alive , in great pain for an extended period of time , they give more money for that .
LISA: I 'd say she was alive for ten minutes .
DAVE: And I gather in a lot .of pain ?
LISA: Her leg was cut off .
DAVE: Yes obviously . And but was she conscious ? Awake , the whole time ?
LISA: I 'm sorry , Emily . Yeah , awake .
EMILY: That 's OK .
DAVE: Well , if she was in a lot of pain for that long I do n't know . . .maybe 300,000 or a half a million dollars to get a sustainable verdict ? A brain damaged baby would be• three million . But the truth is , Lisa , after all 's said and done , it 's not a very good case .
LISA: Why not ?
DAVE: Because it 's your word against his , and ecause you already lied on your first deposition . A red light case is a fifty- fifty proposition already . And with only one eyewitness , with two conflicting statements ? I would n't take-that case . Pink Revised 9/25/05 - Page 111
EMILY: Nobody really cares about getting a lot of money here .
DAVE: I understand that
EMILY: We just want this prick to Buffer . and we want the bus company to take resonsibility for hiring this guy .
DAVE: I understand . But no matter how you slice it , the fact that Lisa lied on her first statement is a disaster for your lawyer .
LISA: Ca n't I explain why I lied the first time ? It 's not like I 'm trying to get any money for myself .
DAVE: That 's true-Since she have no financial interest she ca n't be impeached for bias .
EMILY: Impeached for what ?
DAVE: She ca n't have her credibility attacked on financial grounds because the jury knows you 're not getting any money if you win .
LISA: So that's'something , is n't it ?
EMILY: But do you really think we know what that means ?
DAVE: I 'm sorry . That 's what its called .
EMILY: But who are you talking to ? You know we do n't know what that means . It 's like you 're not really concentrating .
DAVE: I do n't know . I am concentrating . I 'm just thinking out loud .
EMILY: OX . All right . I 'm sorryI
DAVE: Anyway.. the only thing I could think of is it i @ the MTA . So they 're not gon na want a lot of publicity .
LISA: Anyway , the whole point is to get this guy
EMILY: Is to fucking get this guyl
LISA: No , its to get him out from behind the wheel of a bus !
DAVE: Did she know she was dying ? I only ask ecause the terror of knowing you 're dying aises the damages .
LISA: I think she had a pretty good idea .
DAVE: If she had lived for a couple of days it would make the case betterI know this sounds horrible , but this is what it comes down to
EMILY: I know . We know , Dave . That 's OK . Silence . Emily starts to speak
DAVE: I actually did have one more thoughtI do know one guy who 's , uh You know what ? Yo know what I want to do7 I want to make a few phone calls , and then , just let me get ack to you .
EMILY: I would just like somebody to take esponsibility for what happened .
LISA: Yes , Detective Mitchell please ? . My name is Lisa Cohen ? C 0 H Yes , I 'll hold . Fuck you Pink Revised 9/25/05 - Page 112A
MITCHELL: Detective Mitchell .
LISA: Oh , hi , it 's Lisa Cohen calling .
MITCHELL: Hi Lisa , what can I do for you ?
LISA: Well , I was just wondering what eve happened , if anything , with the case . You said you might re-interview the bus driver
LISA: You did ? What happened ?
MITCHELL: Well , he basically stuck to his original epresentation , and that was pretty much it . I brought it up with my sergeant , but he agrees with me we still do n't have enough to charge this guy , so there 's eally not a lot more we can do at this point .
LISA: But how did you ask the questions ?
MITCHELL: Excuse me ?
LISA: He 's obviously not gon na change his statement if you just ask him like really politely Why would he ? We already know he 's a liar .
MITCHELL: Hey , you know , Lisa , in the old days we 'd just throw him in the back with a rubbe hose and we 'd get whatever answer we want out of him . But fortunately we do n't do that kind of thing anymore
LISA: Yeah , not to white people .
MITCHELL: Excuse me ?
LISA: You do n't do it to white people . Anyway , I 'm not saying you
MITCHELL: We do n't do it to who ?
LISA: Oh my God
MITCHELL: First of all , I do n't know why you 're ingin ' the guy 's race into it . There 's forty thousand cops in this city
LISA: Yes , thank you , yes .
MITCHELL: and I hate to disillusion you , but most of 'em are pretty good guys , just tryin ' to do their job . Bottom line is the DA 's not gon na take this case . Now you could talk to my sergeant if you want to , but
LISA: Yes , I would .
JOAN: What 's going on ? LISA waves her away .
RAMON: But why do you put yourself down ? It 's a wonderful show and a wonderful performance .
JOAN: No , it 's not I 'm not putting myself down . It 's just that the audience always eacts differently if they 've been told it 's good . A lot of actors have that experience .
RAMON: Mm hm ? She takes a few steps away .
JOAN: I love this view You know , Ramonthis may sound very stupid to you , ut do you ever worry that we do n't have very much in common ?
RAMON: What do you mean ?
JOAN: Well , I do n't mean to sound dissatisfied , or disgruntled . But I feel like we 're always misunderstanding each other . Do you feel that way at all ? Or am I just completely off the beam ?
RAMON: I do n't think we should talk about that , Joan .
JOAN: You do n't ? WellI think it 's kind of important or I would n't have brought it up .
RAMON: Joan I like you very much . But let 's not talk about what you are like , and what I am like . That never makes a good result . Talk about it with your friends .
JOAN: My friends !
RAMON: Yes . 2nd Pink Revised 11/17/05 - Page 116
JOAN: Sure . Just do n't tell me what they 're like .
RAMON: That 's a little place we used to go on holiday , two hours outside of CartagenaMy family is all there still , ut Rodrigo is studying in London , and Hector is in Geneva .
JOAN: Uh huh
RAMON: I 'm sure they will go back eventually , ecause they like to do something for thei country . But it 's a worry , because it 's very bad there now .
JOAN: YeahI have n't really been following it .
RAMON: It 's a big , big mess . Last year I helped to found an organization to work with children whose families have been killed , or the parents have been kidnapped , so they do n't know if they are alive or dead . We try to find homes for them , preferably in Colombia , because if we lose our young people , that 's it That 's the future . We have raised a lot of money , but there 's only so much we can do . You do n't like to say it 's hopeless , but it 's hard to see the solution .
JOAN: Yeah . GodI wish I knew more about itDo you mind if I ask you something ?
RAMON: Of course not .
JOAN: Why are you interested in me ? 2nd Pink Revised 11/17/05 - Page 116A
RAMON: You do n't think I should be ?
JOAN: I just feel kind of ignorant about you whole world
RAMON: You think it would be better if we knew about all the same things ?
JOAN: Not really , not exclusively . It 's just unusual . Do n't you think it 's unusual ? 2nd Pink Revised 11/17/05 - Page 117
RAMON: Not for me .
JOAN: I guess you travel a lot . I 've only been out of the country a few times in my whole life .
RAMON: You should travel more .
JOAN: I know . I 've always wanted to . It 's hard when you 're in the theater
RAMON: Still , you should try . It 's a big world . You 're an artist . You should see more of it .
JOAN: I know . You do n't have to keep saying that . I 've always wanted to travel . It 's just a little difficult with two kids and no husband , but it 's hard to make a lot of money in the theater . I was on a TV show a few years back and I socked away some money ecause of that , but my ex-husband
RAMON: Karl .
JOAN: Karl , yes , you remembered , very good . Karl 's very generous with the kids when he can be , but he 's struggling too He 's a director he directs commercials , and now he 's trying to produce them Anyway , I 'm not ignorant because I enjoy it .
RAMON: I do n't say you 're ignorant Do you think Lisa will be interested in acting ?
JOAN: I do n't think so . I think 's she 's got a lot of contempt for it . Of course that may e the age .
RAMON: She would prefer the world with no plays ? No films ?
JOAN: Oh Who knows . 2nd Pink Revised 11/17/05 - Page 117A
RAMON: Would you like to see a picture of my mother ?
JOAN: Sure .
RAMON: These are all my aunts and unclesSee ? Big family
JOAN: Mmm . She looks at him as he turns the pages .
DAVE: So after I talked to you guys I called this P.I . I know and I asked him to Pink Revised 9/25/05 - Page 118
EMILY: You called a what ? A what ?
DAVE: Private Investigator to see if he could find anything out about your bus driver
LISA: Really ?
DAVE EMILY: Yeah So he Dave !
DAVE: Wait , let me tell you what he said ! So he called this guy he knows who used to be a cop for the MTA . Did you know the MTA have their own police ? The MTA police ? They have their own uniforms
EMILY: Yeah ? Yeah ? Yeah ?
DAVE: so this guy got someone to let him sneak a look at your guy 's file . And it turns out he 's had two previous accidents less than two years apart one of them on the job , one in his own car
EMILY: What ?
DAVE: where there was some allegation that he was drinking , which was dropped , but , that he 's never been cited or disciplined , just moved around to different shifts
EMILY: Are you fucking kidding me ?
LISA: Why does this not shock me ?
DAVE: Because Surprise Surprise his brother-in- law is a very big muckety-muck in the Transit Workers Union Pink Revised 9/25/05 - Page 119
EMILY: O-Kayl
DAVE: And if you read the paper , you 'll know they 're going through a protracted labo dispute at the MTA right now , and according to my PI , the management does n't want to aggravate the situation by firing this guy . Especially since the police have concluded he was not at fault .
LISA: This is making me sick .
DAVE: I know , but what it means , Lisa , is that we have a case .
LISA: We do ?
DAVE: What it means , in fact , is that we have a very good case , because we can sue fo what 's called `` Negligent Retention . '' Which means they should have known the guy was a ad risk and was irresponsible and they negligently retained him until he finally killed somebody .
EMILY: And you can prove that ?
DAVE: Sure , because we can subpoena thei Personnel records , which we already know contain damaging information , because my investigator got a look at them beforehand . Which you 're not-supposed to do , but we did it anyway .
EMILY: And that means
DAVE: That means we 're in great shape and I think we should go in there and sue their fuckin ' asses off .
EMILY: But you would n't be our lawyer , right ? Pink Revised 9/25/05 - Page 120
DAVE: No no . Oh no .
LISA: Why not ?
DAVE EMILY: I 'm not a personal injury It 's not his area . litigator . I do n't know enough about it . I would lose .
EMILY: But you could recommend someone ?
DAVE: Sure . I know a guy who 's very good . His name is Russel Deutsch . He 's not a sleazebag . Very experienced . Let me give you his number
EMILY: Dave , thank you so much .
LISA: Really . My God .
DAVE: But you got ta get that crazy cousin on oard because she 's gon na be you eneficiary .
EMILY: She 's not gon na want to come to New York , I can tell you that right now .
DAVE: If you win she gets anywhere from three to five hundred thousand dollars . She 's gon na come to New York .
LISA: What 's with Monica and her cousin ?
EMILY: Oh , Monica 's father left some money to Abigail 's kids and he made Monica the executor of the estate , because he did n't want Abigail and her idiot husband to get their hands on the money before the kids were grown up .
LISA: So that 's who we 're getting the money for ?
EMILY: It 's not who we 're getting it for , it 's who we 're getting it from .
DEUTSCH: First thing we do is we file a summons and a complaint against the MTA . They get .twenty days to respond , and when they do we can make our Discovery requests Accident eports , personnel records , et cetera . But you got ta realize it 's gon na take some time . The law says you have to get a court date within a year . Usually it takes about six . Depending .
LISA: Six years !
DEUTSCH: Depending , yes .
EMILY: Now , I mentioned to Dave I have a friend who writes for the Metro section of the Times
DEUTSCH: Yes Now this , if it could really happen , this changes everything in our favor . If they think there 's gon na be adverse publicity , especially in The New York Times , they 're gon na want to settle right away , soon as possible , and as quietly as
EMILY: So they'd.make it a condition that
DEUTSCH: It 's usually done , you get the money but you ca n't talk about it . Nobody knows the terms .
LISA: So what good does that do ?
DEUTSCH: You get the money . is that bad ? I thought that 's what we 're all here for . This is how our society punishes people for doing bad things .
LISA: By getting money from their employers ' insurance . companies ?
DEUTSCH: Yes . It 's called Punitive Damages . Pause .
LISA: Could we insist they fire the driver ? As part of the settlement ?
DEUTSCH: Yes , sure , why not ?
LISA: But is that something people do ?
DEUTSCH: Sure . It 's one of your conditions .
EMILY: Great .
LISA: And you think we 're gon na win ? They 're gon na settle ?
DEUTSCH: Oh they 're gon na settle .
LISA: This is Emily and Lisa take hands and squeeze .
JOAN: I want to talk to you .
LISA: What 'd I do now ?
JOAN: Hi . I 'm Joan . It 's nice to meet you .
EMILY: Nice to meet you too . Come on in .
SARDONICALLY: Hi Emily .
JOAN: .I had a friend who used to live on this lock , at 262 ?
EMILY: Oh ?
JOAN: Yeah , I do n't know if you know her . Cheryl Rowan ? She 's a physiotherapist ?
EMILY: No , I do n't know her .
LISA: I think about a thousand people must
JOAN: What ?
LISA: Nothing
EMILY: Lisa says you 're in a play , Joan ?
JOAN: Oh Yeah
LISA: You should go see it , it 's really good .
JOAN: Well , the play is great , and it 's a really nice cast..- .
LISA: She 's just being modest . She 's gon na win every award in New York .
JOAN: Oh all that stuff 's a long way off .
EMILY: I do n't go to the theater very much .
JOAN: Well , it 's just nice , because you can work a long time in the theater and play really good parts without getting a lot of ecognition . And even though you do n't necessarily do it for that as your primary motive , it is very nice when people do notice something you 've done .
EMILY: Uh huh
JOAN: I was on a television show a few years ago , and I had been doing theater all my life , and suddenly all my relatives started calling me up to congratulate me because they thought I finally Made It . And it was eally just this dumb show that paid the ills for a while
LISA: That show was so stupid .
JOAN: It was n't that bad ! Anyway I realize this is horribly embarrassing for Lisa , but I really wanted to meet you , Emily , because you 've frankly become such a big part of Lisa 's life , and I do n't want to be intrusive , but this whole court case seems to be suddenly dominating everything and I ca n't get Lisa to tell me anything about it
LISA: That 's not true !
JOAN: Well , I ca n't ! And I want you to know , Lisa , that I 'm very , very proud of you fo pursuing this the way you have .
LISA: Yeah , I do .
JOAN: I know you do . I know you do . But you ca n't not do your homework , and you ca n't throw away your scholarship because of it .
LISA: I 'm not . My grades slipped a little . They 'll get better . Anyone can do thei homework . You just sit down and do it . I 've been distracted . I 'll stop .
JOAN: All right
LISA: We did n't need to have a big conference about it .
EMBARRASSED: It 's not a big conference , I just want to know what 's going on . And I wanted to meet Emily I know it 's a little awkward !
EMILY: Do n't apologize . If Lisa has n't been keeping you apprised of what 's been going on , I think she should . You should .
LISA: There 's nothing to keep her apprised of. , We 're just waiting for them to schedule the Discovery conference .
JOAN: Now what is that ?
LISA: Mom ? It really does n't matter .
EMILY: A Discovery conference is a meeting with the court where they sign an order . authorizing our lawyer to begin getting the personnel records , interviewing witnesses , talking to Monica 's cousin
JOAN: OK , now where does she fit in ?
EMILY: She gets the money .
DEUTSCH: How would you describe the relationship overall ? Did you talk on the phone a lot ? Were there a lot of visits
ABIGAIL: I would say we talked on the phone a couple of times a month at least . Sometimes more than thatI would call her , she would call me
DEUTSCH: And what were the nature of these conversations ?
ABIGAIL: Oh , I would say so , yes .
DEUTSCH: Would you have any phone records ? Or
ABIGAIL: I have all my phone bills , if that 's what you mean . I did n't record the actual conversations
DEUTSCH: No no
PRODUCES BILLS: You 'll see we talked on the phone quite frequently .
DEUTSCH: OK , that 's terrific . I see you came prepared1
ABIGAIL: Well , I wanted to bring everything .
DEUTSCH: Now when they take your deposition you 're gon na say the same thing you just told me . Talk about the relationship
ABIGAIL: Uh huh ?
DEUTSCH: Kind of advice she used to give you
ABIGAIL: Now , Emily , where did you find this lawyer ?
EMILY: He was recommended by a friend .
ABIGAIL: I 'm asking because my husband knows a real good New York lawyer , and I 'm not entirely comfortable with someone that no one has ever heard of
EMILY: My friend 's heard of him . He says he 's very good..
ABIGAIL: I 'm sure he does . But I have a esponsibility in this situation , and I would feel a whole lot more comfortable with somebody who did n't just drop in out of the clear blue sky 2nd Green Revised 11/20/05 - Page 128
EMILY: He did n't drop in out of the clear blue sky . He was recommended by my friend . But even if we switched lawyers we 'd still have to pay him . But it all comes out of the settlement , so it 's really up to you .
ABIGAIL: No , if you all think he 's good
EMILY: I do n't know whether he is or not . My friend thinks he is .
ABIGAIL: All right . Now Lisa , what is you involvement in all this ? What 's your angle ?
LISA: I just wanted toI was just there .
LISA: God So how old was she when she died ?
LISA: God . I ca n't even imagine .
EMILY: Neither could we .
LISA: You know Monica asked about her when she was dying ? 2nd Green Revised 11/20/05 - Page 128A-129
EMILY: No . I did n't .
EMILY: What do you mean ? What did she say ?
LISA: She just asked if somebody could call he daughter . But then it got confusing because I said , `` Sure , what 's her name ? '' And she said her name was Lisa . And I said , `` No , that 's my name . '' Because it took me a minute I did n't realize we had the same name Emily does not respond .
VERY DRY: I see . And is she still inhabiting you ody ? Or did she go right back to the spirit world after it was over ?
LISA: I did n't mean she ws literally inhabiting my body . I do n't believe in all that stuff at all .
LISA: Oh my God ! Why are you so mad at me ! ?
EMILY: Because this is not an opera !
EMILY: Yes !
LISA: You think I 'm making this into a dramatic situation because I think it 's dramatic ? ! ?
EMILY: I think you 're very young .
LISA: What does that have to do with anything ? If anything I think it means I care more than someone who 's older ! Because this kind of thing has never happened to me before !
EMILY: No , it means you care more easily ! There 's a big difference ! Except that it 's not you it 's happening to !
LISA: Yes it is ! I know I 'm not the one who was run over
EMILY: That 's right , you were n't . And you 're not the one who died of leukemia , and you 're not the one who just died in an earthquake in Algeria ! But you will be . Do you understand me ? You will be . And it 's not an opera and it 's not dramatic
LISA: I 'm well aware of that !
EMILY: And this first-blush phony deepness of yours is worth nothing .
LISA: Oh wow .
EMILY: Do you understand ? It 's not worth anything , ecause it 'll be troweled over in a month or two . And then when you get older , and you do n't have a big reaction every time a d gets run over , then , then we 'll find out what kind of a person you are ! But this is nothing ! I 'm sorry , but I did n't start this conversation and I do n't play these games . 2nd Green Revised 11/20/05 - Page 131
LISA: I am not
EMILY: And do n't look so outraged ! Because I 'm not saying anything very outrageous ! I 'm telling you to knock it off ! You have every ight to falsify your own life , but you have no right to falsify anyone else 's . It 's what makes people into Nazis ! And I 'm sorry , but it 's a little suspicious that you 're making such a fuss about this when you did n't know her , and you 're having troubles with your own mother
LISA: Oh my God !
EMILY: But this is nm life we 're talking about , much more than it is yours ! Because it 's my eal friend who got killed , who I 'm neve going to see again , really ! Whom I have known since I was nineteen years old myself . OK ? And I do n't want that sucked into some kind of adolescent self- dramatization !
LISA: I 'm not fucking dramatizing anything !
LISA: I was there , and you were n't ! And if I happen to express myself a little hyperbolically , Emily , that 's just the way I talk ! I ca n't help it if my mother is an actress ! Why are you being so fucking strident ?
EMILY: Strident ?
LISA: Yeah .
EMILY: OK. Um , you should leave .
LISA: Why ? Because I called you strident ?
EMILY: Yeah Strident ? You should leave . Thanks . I do n't wan na be called strident and you 're deliberately misunderstanding me !
LISA: No I 'm not ! You 're insulting me enough as it is You do n't have to call me stupid too !
EMILY: Well I ca n't stop you doing this so I think you had better go .
LISA: OK ! I will .
LISA: OK ! Let me get my purse !
EMILY: It means you 're leaving . I do n't know what else it means .
LISA: All I meant by saying you were strident was that you were being emphatic ! I obviously misused the word !
EMILY: Look it up when you get home .
LISA: Jesus Christ . You 're amazing .
EMILY: Yeah . Uh huh . I 'm amazing .
LISA: Why are you doing this . !
EMILY: Lisa , I 'm not doing anything ! I 'm a human eing ! Monica was a human being ! So was her daughter ! And so is your mother !
LISA: I never said or thought you were ! And I eally did n't mean to call you strident ! I totally misused the word ! I was n't trying to insult you , Emily , I really was n't ! I feel so bad about what happened and I 'm trying so hard to do something about it ! And I do n't understand why if I say something wrong you ca n't just give me a eak ! I did n't mean I thought her daughte took over my body . I 'm not an idiot . It was just this feeling I had because she was holding onto my hand so hard before she died , and because we had the same first name !
LISA: But I 'm not trying to dramatize anything , Emily . I really know about that trend , and I really do n't think I 've been doing that .
LISA: I will .
JOAN: I 've been in the theater my whole life and nothing like this has ever happened to me
CHARMINGLY: I guess !
JOAN: Oh God .
LISA: All right . Let me ask her .
JOAN: Dig in everybody They start eating .
LISA: I was thinking about spending next yea with Dad .
SHOCKED: Oh ?
LISA: Yeah . You 're all worried about my grades . They have really good public schools in Santa Monica , and if Iofficially lived with him , you would n't have to worry about my scholarship .
JOAN: Have you talked to him about this ?
LISA: We 've had some general discussions .
TO CURTIS: Do you want to go too ?
SURPRISED: Me ?
JOAN: Yeah . Do you want to move to LA too ?
CURTIS: No .
JOAN: Well , just let me know if you do .
LISA: Why are you being like this ?
JOAN: Why am I being like what ?
LISA: Why are you about to start crying ?
JOAN: Because it 's your intention to make me start crying !
LISA: No it 's not
LISA: Fine ! Keep it up ! It really makes me want to stay here !
JOAN: You think you 're so fucking perfect ! ? She breaks something else and walks out .
LISA: No .
CURTIS: Good one .
LISA: Shut up . Green Revised 10/7/05 - Page 136
KLEIN: OK. Go ahead Kirsten . Lionel Put you drum away .
KIRSTEN: I think that teenagers should definitely ule the world , because teenagers are n't corrupted by adult life yet , and they 're idealists and they care . And I know a lot of people feel that teenagers are really naive , which they are , many of them . But they still have n't had a chance to get urned out by the disappointments and the harsh realities of learning how to play the game . So yes , I would vote yes .
KLEIN: All right Lisa ?
LISA: I would tend to agree with all of that , except I do think that teenagers do n't always necessarily think things through very carefully , and they do n't have enough experience to know what the right thing to do is all the time . I also think they tend to adhere to ideologies really easily without having actually bothered to think them through for themselves .
LEWIS: Such as what ?
LISA: Such as what ? Such as , gee , I do n't know the Hitler Youth ?
KLEIN: OK Hitler Youth .
LISA: Or what about all these teenage suicide ombers ? Not that I want to get into the whole Palestinian thing again , but assuming you do n't think suicide bombing is a good thing , would n't you say that 's an example of being idealistic without using you critical faculties ?
LEWIS: OK , Angie ?
ANGIE: Yeah , I do n't want to get into the whole Palestinian thing again either , because I realize I 'm completely outnumbered
ANTHONY: Not unlike the Palestinians themselves .
ANGIE: That 's not really funny , Anthony . ANGIE KLEIN
LEWIS LISA: Come on , guys Yes ! That 's partly why they like it ! There 's ANGIE still a million Pale-
LEWIS: OK , OK ! Monica ?
MONICA: Well , I do n't know if this is good or bad , ut speaking of ideology , it 's interesting that the suicide bombers just fo example care enough about what they elieve in to sacrifice their lives for it .
ANGIE: Yes . Yes !
LISA: I think it 's fine if you want to sacrifice your life for what you believe in . I actually think that 's really noble . It 's a little different when you 're willing to sacrifice someone else 's life , you know ? I personally do n't think that 's such a big ideological achievement !
ANGIE: Um , even if there 's no other way to get you out of my country ?
LEWIS LISA: Raise your hands ! They have n't tried any other ways ! It 's not ANGIE like killing civilians Yes they have ! They 're is their last resort ! trying it right now ! It 's their first resort ! Because it 's easy and they like it !
LISA: Yes ! There are bad people in the world ! I think they liked blowing up the World Trade Center ! They kill their own sisters when they get raped ! It 's called barbarism !
LEWIS: If you ladies ca n't make your points without yelling or interrupting each othe or raising your hands , I 'd say it was a pretty good argument for `` No . ''
LISA: Why , adults do n't yell and interrupt each other ? 2nd Blue Revised 10/28/05 - Page 138A
LEWIS: Lisa !
LISA: Sorry .
LEWIS: Let 's try to put this in a broade perspective . The question was not actually who 's to blame in the Arab Israeli conflict
ANGIE: The Israelis .
LISA: OK , you 're a moron .
LEWIS: Lisa !
LISA: Fine . Thank you .
ANGIE LEWIS: No I did n't . Lisa , GO ! Lisa leaves . Lewis turns to the class .
RAMON: That 's the best show yet ! Every time it 's a better performance .
JOAN: God , thank you ! Hi , Emily , thanks so much for coming
EMILY: Oh , thank you for the tickets .
JOAN: Shall we go ?
LISA: and I guess I lost my cool a little , ut I just love it'when people start comparing the Israelis to Nazis
JOAN: But who is running these discussions ?
RAMON: Well , but Lisa , you have to remember , it 's always easy for the dominant side to be content with the status quo .
JOAN: Mmm .
RAMON: I mean the oppressor is always in favor of law and order because it 's his law and his order . He uses violence to maintain his position and calls it the rule of law . But when the person underfoot uses violence to change his status he 's called a criminal and a terrorist , and the violence of the State is called upon to put him down , and once again it 's called the rule of law . In
EMILY: I see . And what would you like them to do ? Pause .
RAMON: `` They '' meaning
EMILY: The Jew oppressors . What would you like them to do ? Pause .
RAMON: I did n't use that expression . EMILY But since you ask - No , you did n't .
LISA: Um , I just spent the whole day arguing about this I did n't really mean to bring it up again .
EMILY: Do n't handle me .
LISA: I 'm not handling you .
GENERALLY: What did you think of the play ?
RAMON LISA: And I think it 's ironic in Do n't bother , Mom . the extreme that the victims of Nazis find it essential EMILY
LISA: That 's what I think !
JOAN: That seems excessive , Emily , come on
RAMON: That 's the response . That 's the Jewish esponse .
EMILY: It 's the what ?
RAMON: It 's the Jewish response . You do n't like what I am saying or what I do , so you
EMILY: That 's my Jewish response .
JOAN: Oh my God !
RAMON: It 's all right That 's all right It 's a perfect little .encapsuleIt 's the Jewish response .
LISA: Sorry about all that tonight .
JOAN: Yeah . Your friend is a delight .
LISA: She 's a really passionate person . She eally cares about things .
JOAN: She 's rude , Lisa . Ramon was my guest , not hers . And-so.was she , as a matter of fact
LISA: So what ? Why is it so JOAN
JOAN: I do n't want to talk to you right now . Please go away .
RAMON: Joan , I wo n't defend myself . All what I meant was , that was the typical response you will get from someone who will take that position that that woman was taking . But if you like to break up with me because I used the wrong adjective , what I 'm going to do ? I 'm not going to beg you .
LISA: Well ? How 's that anti-Semitic piece of shit Ramon ? -
JOAN: Oh God , I do n't know . The PHONE RINGS . Lisa picks up .
LISA: Hello ?
ON PHONE: Yeah . It 's Dad .
LISA: Hi , Dad , how are you ? I 'm really looking forward to our horseback riding trip
KARL: Yeah . That 's why I 'm calling . I do n't think it 's going to happen .
LISA: Really ? What 's the matter ?
KARL: Nothing 's the matter . Nobody seems to eally want to go , and I do n't really feel like spending three thousand bucks on something nobody has the slightest interest in . So I think it 's obviously better fo everyone if we just cancel .
LISA: I never said I did n't want to go .
KARL: Well , I ca n't seem to get a straight answe about what anybody wants to eat , um , Annette is giving me a hard time about he schedule , I talk to Curtis and all I get are monosyllables , so
LISA: I think-he 's really looking forward to it
KARL: Uh huh ? Well , you know , that has n't really een my impression . So , uhI also think it would be good to shelve the idea of you coming out here next year .
LISA: We do n't detest each othe
KARL: OK , well , it does n't really strike me as something you 're that serious about anyway , so what do you say we just table it for the time being ?
KARL: OK . So tell Curtis , uh , that New Mexico 's offUmmm , and I will talk to you , ummm , whenever .
KARL: Yeah . He hangs up . LISA hangs up too .
JOAN: What 's wrong ?
LISA: Dad 's cancelling the trip .
JOAN: What ? Why ?
LISA: He 's says nobody wants to go and he does n't want to spend the money .
JOAN: Did you say you did n't want to go ?
LISA: No , I know there was some problem with Annette about arranging for food because I do n't eat dead animals , but.I did n't think it was.going to wreck the whole trip .
JOAN: Oh boy .
LISA: I thought you said it sounded like it was going to be a disaster . Personally I 'm elieved . I 'm not moving out there , either , y the way , obviously . Which is fine too .
MR AARON: That 's all right
LISA: You 've always been very sympathetic to my craziness , and I may not show it all the time , but I actually really appreciate it .
MR AARON: It 's no problem , Lisa . What 's been going on ?
LISA: I just need to talk to somebody who does n't completely misunderstand who Iam . Or not even who I am , but what 's going on inside me , or all around me . Sound confused enough ? Anyway , for whatever reason , I always felt like we understood each othe on some level , even though I 'm like a mass of conflicting impulses and you 're asically the most grown-up , rational man I know .
MR AARON: WellI doubt that 's actually true ut thank you
LISA: You seem pretty fuckin ' rational to me . Like that seems to be your leading feature . I mean you obviously have a lot of pretty deep feelingsSo when you 're rational - just to finish my thought it 's like this eally interesting way of governing yourself .
MR AARON: WellWe all have feelings , Lisa . I happen to believe that who you are comes out of how you deal with those feelings . Somebody makes you mad , you do n't just pick up a gun and shoot themOr if you do , that says something about who you are , and how you 've een raised
LISA: Well , I do n't want to disillusion you , but we happen to be living in a world where that is what people do . More often than not .
MR AARON: That 's not true , Lisa . I think it 's very sad that you see it that way . There 's eight billion people alive in the world and you think they do n't all want to kill someone once in a while ? But they do n't . Most of them . Or they see some person they I think most people do try to be civilized by some standard . Even if it 's a standard you and I might not agree with
LISA: No , I get it . That 's actually the most hopeful thing anybody 's said to me for a long time . I do n't know why I take such a dire view of things , I really do n't .
MR AARON: Sure .
LISA: Do you allow smoking in your apartment ?
MR AARON: You can smoke .
LISA: I like your apartment .
MR AARON: Thank you . She blows some smoke out and waves it away .
LISA: Sorry .
MR AARON: That 's all right .
LISA: This is terrible .
MR AARON: What is ? What 's terrible ?
LISA: I just like you so much Sorry . What a moron .
MR AARON: Hey . Lisa . I 'm your friend . And that 's not gon na change . That 's not gon na change .
LISA: Thanks . Thank you . She kisses his hand a couple of times .
MR AARON: Lisa
LISA: Please just let me for a second . I like you so much . I like you so , so much .
MR AARON: OK , look
LISA: Do n't stop me yet , OK ?
MR AARON: Please do n't do that .
LISA: Just let me for one second She bends her head over his lap . He lets her .
MR AARON: Are you all right ?
LISA: Nothing . It 's OK .
MR AARON: Are you all right ?
LISA: Yes , yes , you do n't have to keep asking me that .
MR AARON: I think we should stop .
LISA: No , keep going ! She keeps pushing against him .
MR AARON: Sorry . I really did n't expect anything like this to happen . I 'm really not sure how to eact .
LISA: Do n't worry . I 'm not gon na tell anybody if that 's what you 're worried about . I totally initiated the whole thing .
DEUTSCH: Well , they want to settle .
EMILY: Fantastic .
LISA: Sorry .
EMILY: That 's OK .
ABIGAIL: Mr Deutsch ? Mr
DEUTSCH ROB: I 'm right here . I just had the thought
ROB: Mr Deutsch , I had the thought , if they 're willing to settle so quickly , maybe we 're etter off waiting a little bit , maybe attling the sabre a little bit more
ABIGAIL: Yes , if they 're so quick to agree to a settlement on this basis
DEUTSCH: What you got ta realize What you got ta
EMILY: Abigail , Russel does n't think Sorry , go ahead .
EMILY: My friend had a lot of trouble getting the one story placed in the paper as it is
DEUTSCH: .Could I interject ?
ABIGAIL: But if they responded so strongly based on one story
ROB: Maybe we 're cuttin ' our own throats here .
DEUTSCH: They are responding to the story in the paper
ABIGAIL: .That 's just common sense .
DEUTSCH: But what you got ta understand is they 're offering to settle now because they want to get the story out of the paper .
ABIGAIL: I 'm sorry
ROB: We did n't hear that last . Green Revised 10/7/05 - Page 150A
DEUTSCH: Ladies , let me just Abigail . Rob .
ABIGAIL: What other terms would there be ?
ROB: What do you mean , like some kind of a fund ?
DEUTSCH: A what ?
DEUTSCH: I do n't understand what you mean by a fund
ROB ABIGAIL: Mr. Deutsch ? Do you mean
LISA: These people are retarded .
ABIGAIL: Because I have to tell you we have just lived through that nightmare with Monica and our children , and it was not a pleasant experience . We just want a clean , straight damages is fine . A regular payment . We 'll pay the taxes on it . At least we 'll have something in our hand
DEUSTCH: I do n't really know what kind of fund you 're talking about
LISA: We 're not talking about Hi , this is Lisa ? We 're ABIGAIL talking We 're talking Hello , Lisa . about Hello ? Green Revised 10/7/05 - Page 152
ABIGAIL: We 're still here .
LISA: We 're talking about the driver , getting the driver fired
ABIGAIL: Oh , yes
LISA: as part of the conditions .
EMILY: Yes , Abigail , it 's very important to us that the company know that 's an absolute pre-condition to making any kind of settlement whatsoever .
ABIGAIL: Oh yes . Absolutely . If you think he 's at
ROB: Just as long as they do n't think they can uy us off just by gettin ' rid of this guy . You see what I mean ?
DEUTSCH: Absolutely .
ROB: What we 're most concerned about here is the amount .
EMILY: Yes , we 're getting that , Rob .
ROB: But you see what I mean ?
DEUTSCH: Yes Rob ? Yes I do .
ROB: I just want to go on record as saying I think this whole meeting is premature .
ABIGAIL: Absolutely . We 're not lawyers
DEUTSCH: Abigail ? Rob ? I just wan na make something clear . One conversation does not commit you to anything .
JOAN: Lisa , I 'm really proud of you !
LISA: Thank you .
JOAN: Really , really proud !
LISA: Thank you .
JOAN: No . This house is really beginning to get to me . And I 'm a little confused what to do about Ramon . I mean , you were there What do you think ?
LISA: Uh , gee , Mom maybe you should really think about it some more . Because it would probably hurt Ramon 's feelings if you broke up with him and I think you better think about it before you do something like that to him .
JOAN: I know I 'm supposed to understand what you 're doing right now , but if there 's some kind of hidden message here I 'm not getting it .
LISA: No shit . You 're on your own , Mom .
JOAN: Thanks a lot .
LISA: You 're welcome . The PHONE RINGS . Joan picks it up .
LISA: What 's the matter ?
LISTENING: Yes ? . Yes ? Ramon had a heart attack .
LISA: What ? Is he gon na be
JOAN: uiet !
LISA: OK , I 'm really not trying to be funny , but is n't this a Jewish funeral home ?
JOAN: I guess they do both .
RODRIGO: Excuse me . Joan ?
JOAN: Yes . You must be Rodrigo . Oh my God , oh I 'm so sorry . She impulsively embraces him .
RODRIGO: I want to tell you , Joan , my Dad talked about you all the time .
JOAN: He did ?
RODRIGO: Yes . The night he met you , he called me in England and woke me to tell me about it , he was so excited . I never heard him talk about anyone like that since my mothe died .
JOAN: Really ?
RODRIGO: I do n't know if this is appropriate
JOAN: No it 's OK !
RODRIGO: .but he went out a lot . Do you know the last time I spoke to him he told me from the moment he met you he knew he wanted to marry you , because for the first time since he lost my mother , he finally met a woman he could really connect with .
JOAN: Well he was a very sweet man . And I know he loved you and your brother very much .
GETTING TEARFUL: Yeah , I know he did . Thank you .
JOAN: Thanks for coming with me today . I really appreciate it .
LISA: Oh , you 're welcome .
JOAN: I do n't want to be macabre , but Ramon and I were supposed to go to hear The Tales of Hoffman the week after next and I still have the tickets . Would you be interested in going ? Or should I give them away ? 2nd Pink Revised 11/17/05 - Page 156
LISA: Um , I 'll go .
JOAN: OK . It 's Monday night . We can dress up .
JOAN: What did you make of that ?
STILL TYPING: People do n't relate to each other , Mom . They 're totally disconnected . And if they have any time for each other at all , it 's either like a biological imperative or like some weird cultural anomaly . That 's what I make of it .
JOAN: WellI think it 's pretty unfortunate that you think that . Because I feel like you and I used to relate to each other really well .
LISA: I 'm not trying to hurt your feelings . It 's just a general observation .
JOAN: OKHey , could I get a hug ?
LISA: Sure .
JOAN: I just feel totally at sea . They break apart .
MR AARON: I 've thought about this a great deal , and I 'm going to come forward .
LISA: Oh brother .
MR AARON: What does that mean ? 2nd Pink Revised 11/17/05 - Page 156A
LISA: `` You 're gon na come forward . '' And do what ? You did n't kill anybody .
MR AARON: Well , that 's what I 'm comfortable doing .
LISA: Suit yourself . I 'll deny everything and you 're gon na look like a total psycho . And then my Mom'11 have you arrested , and then spend the rest of her life feeling bad about it . So why do n't we just skip the whole thing and forget about it ?
MR AARON: I 'm not sure I know how to do that .
LISA: You 'll learn .
JOAN: OK. What do you want to do ?
LISA: What do you mean ? Are n't JOAN
JOAN: Yes ! Now who is the father ?
LISA: It could be a lot of people .
JOAN: Who .
LISA: I 'm never gon na tell you , Mom ! It 's against my principles ! Such as they are .
ON "SUCH": No , but you want to send that bus driver to jail for running a red light ! And you wo n't tell me about these boys ?
NURSE: Mrs. Cohen ?
LISA: Hi .
JOAN: Hi honey .
LISA: I 'm sorry , Mom .
JOAN: Let 's talk about it later .
DEUTSCH: I 'm very pleased to be able to inform you all that I had a long meeting with the lawyer for the bus company , and they 've agreed to settle out of court for three hundred and fifty thousand dollars .
ABIGAIL ROB: Yes , fantastic That is fantastic !
ROB: That 's OK
ABIGAIL: We 're only
EMILY: Abigail ? Rob ? If we could just listen to what Russel has to say , and then talk about it once he 's told us the whole story and given us his recommendation
ROB: Yes . Sorry . Fire away .
DEUTSCH: I was gon na say I know there was a concern after our last call that we were jumping the gun a little bit
ROB: That 's OK
ABIGAIL: We were just
EMILY: Would you let him talk please ? !
DEUTSCH: It 's OK .
ABIGAIL: We 're sorry .
DEUTSCH: I want to tell you I think it 's a very good offer .
ABIGAIL: Hey . Three hundred and fifty thousand dollars
ROB: OK , now let me just
ROB ABIGAIL: I just want to introduce Now , 1 think Can the thought you all hear me ?
ABIGAIL: Yeow ! Was that everybody ? OK
LISA: What about
ABIGAIL: Emily ? What do you think ?
EMILY: I think it sounds like we should do it . But I 'd like to discuss some of the
ON "BUT": Hey , if that 's the vote
ROB: Unless you think there 's something to be gained from holding out for more .
DEUTSCH: I think it would be a big mistake .
ABIGAIL: Robbie , what do you think ?
ROB: Sold !
ABIGAIL: Sold !
DEUTSCH: OK. Now the only down side to this as it stands and the reason I asked Emily and Lisa to be here is because I know this may e a serious wrinkle for you all is that the bus company will absolutely not discuss the removal of the driver .
LISA: What do you mean ?
ROB: The driver ?
DEUTSCH: Please . Ladies . Let me ROB finish what I 'm saying . Whoa hello !
ABIGAIL: It 's just a blast in our ears .
TO LISA: Let him finish .
LISA: Finish what ? Forget it !
TO EMILY: Thank you . I want you to understand , Lisa , I pressed them very very hard on this , but they will not discuss disciplining of a company employee as part of the settlement ecause it could be seen as an admission of guilt on the part of the MTA
LISA: What does giving us three hundred thousand dollars mean ?
DEUTSCH: Settling out of court does not imply an admission of guilt . It simply does not carry the same stigma . On top of that you may not know , Lisa , they 're involved in a very tricky labor dispute at the MTA right
LISA: Yeah , we know all about that ! Just tell them to forget it . '
DEUTSCH: I know that 's your reaction
LISA: It 's the only reason we 're here .
ROB: Can I jump in here ? Russel ?
TO LISA: .but it 's really not your decision .
ROB ABIGAIL: Hello ? Are you still with us ? Please !
LISA: It 's Emily 's decision .
EMILY: No .
DEUTSCH: No .
ROB: Hello ?
LISA: It 's not ?
ABIGAIL: They 're not listening , Robbie .
DEUTSCH: It 's Abigail 's decision because she 's the next of kin .
LISA: But she did n't even know about it !
EMILY: That does n't matter .
ABIGAIL: Could we get back in this conversation please ?
DEUTSCH: Yes . I 'm sorry . Obviously there 's some very strong emotions going either way on this
ABIGAIL: Listen , Emily ? I do n't know what you 're thinking , but Rob and I are thinking we should take Russel 's recommendation while we can . Because if they wo n't fire the guy , they 're not gon na fire him . And six months or a year from now we 're gon na
ROB: Exactly .
ABIGAIL: we 're gon na be in a situation where we 're beggin ' them for half this much , which is gon na hurt 'em half as much as now , and they 're still not gon na fire this guy ! Or maybe he 'll have already quit and the whole thing will be moot by then.. Do you see what I mean ?
LISA: The entire point of the lawsuit was to get the guy fired so he does n't kill somebody else !
DEUTSCH: Lem me just clarify
LISA: it was not to get you three hundred and fifty thousand dollars you did n't know you were entitled to , for somebody you did n't even like !
ABIGAIL: This is a distortion
LISA: And the only reason you 're getting the money at all is because I started this whole fucking thing in motion ! I 'm sorry for swearing , but you should be willing to trade in all the money for getting this guy off the street
EMILY: For getting him , Abigail !
ABIGAIL: Well I 'm sorry , but I have a responsibility to Monica and I take that responsibility very seriously . You are talking about an offer that is gon na be withdrawn if we do n't do something about it right now .
LISA: None of that matters
ABIGAIL: Unless I 'm wrong about that . Just what is your interest in this ?
LISA: Because I 'm the one who killed her ! I 'm the one who killed her ! But at least I know I did it , and that guy has no idea ! And he 's wandering around blaming everybody else and all I want is for somebody to let him know that what he did was wrong ! And if they do n't fire him and all you want is the money and the police wo n't do anything , how is he gon na know he 's wrong ? You ca n't take the deal , Abigail ! It was n't so you could get any money , it was because we wanted to get him fired ! It does n't matte about the money ! You would n't have gotten it before !
ABIGAIL: Well it may not matter to you , but where I come from three hundred and fifty thousand dollars is an awful lot of money , and to my mind is a positive result of all this tragedy and not just negative . Not just getting someone fired for one mistake , no matter how bad it was
LISA: Oh SHOVE IT UP YOUR ASS !
BONNIE: Hey , Lisa . What 's Up ?
MR AARON: No . I did n't know that .
LISA: Yeah , it cost four hundred dollars .
BONNIE: Um , should I
MR AARON: No , no , do n't go anywhere .
LISA: Yeah , do n't go anywhere .
MR AARON: Do you want to tell us about it ?
LISA: Yeah . I do .
MR AARON: OK. -Go ahead .
LISA: Well She does n't speak . Pause .
BONNIE: Do your parents know about this , Lisa ?
LISA: Yes .
BONNIE: Have you told the father , honey ?
LISA: NoThere 's a couple of people it could e .
MR AARON: I think you better tell them . Whoever they are .
LISA: NoNoNever mind I 'm sure he 's sorry anyway , whichever one he is .
MR AARON: I do n't see what difference that makes , if he 's sorry . And I think whoever it is should know about this .
LISA: I 'm sorry . I should n't have brought this up . Please do n't tell anyone .
BONNIE: We 're not gon na tell anyone . But you 're gon na have to tell whoever it could be
LISA: That 's OK . I got ta go . Thanks fo listening . It 's It does n't matter about the father , because the whole thing was my fault . I 'm sorry ! She shakes her head and runs away .
BONNIE: What was that ?
CURTIS: Mom 's looking for you .
LISA: What for ?
CURTIS: She thinks you 're going out with he tonight .
LISA: Where are we going ?
CURTIS: I do n't know .
JOAN: Lisa ? Honey ? Did you forget we 're going to the opera ?
LISA: Yes .
JOAN: I didn't-remind you because I did n't want to nag you .
LISA: It 's OK .
JOAN: Do n't get run over .
LISA: Wait . I want to see if that 's him .
JOAN: What .
LISA: It is him . Mom , that 's the one
JOAN: Come on . We 're gon na miss the curtain .
LISA: What do you mean ? It 's OK .
SETH: Is that them ?
SETH: Jesus Christ .
PETER: Yeah .
SETH: Fuck me .
WILL EMERSON: Have you guys ever seen this before ?
SETH: No .
WILL EMERSON: Best to just ignore it . Keep your head down and get back to work and do n't watch .
HEATHER: Timothy Singh ?
TIMOTHY: Yes .
HEATHER: I 'm afraid we have to speak with you .
PETER: Excuse me ?
HEATHER: Eric Dale ?

WILL EMERSON: Really ?
SAM ROGERS: Yeah and I do n't have a clue what to do about it .
WILL EMERSON: Well they 're all gone .
SAM ROGERS: How many do we have left ?
WILL EMERSON: Thirty-three .
SAM ROGERS: Make sure everyone is out there , I need to say something .
WILL EMERSON: They are ready for you .
SAM ROGERS: You are all still here for a reason Most of this floor was just sent home forever . We have spent the last hou saying good-bye they were good people and they were good at their jobs but you all were better . Now they are gone . They are not to be thought of again . This is your opportunity . On every floor of this building and in every office from Hong Kong to London the same thing is happening . Before this is all done 3 of every ten guys who were standing between you and your boss 's job are now gone . That is your opportunity . I 've been at this place for thirty-four years and let me tell you that this will not be the last time you go through this . But you all are survivors And that is how this firm over 107 years has always continued to grow stronger . So hold your heads high and get back to work .
ERIC: Robertson ! SARAH does not respond . ERIC Sarah Robertson !
SARAH ROBERTSON: Eric I did n't do anything . They stare at each other .
ERIC: Fuck you .
SETH: You ok ?
PETER: Yeah . Just a little freaked out .
SETH: You want to get a drink ?
PETER: Nah , I need to clean up a few things around here .
SETH: Everyone is going out come on .
PETER: Nah , I 'm fine .
SETH: Well , give me a call if you change you mind .
PETER: I will .
SETH: Come on .
PETER: Where are you going ?
SETH: The Grand .
PETER: I 'll call you when I 'm done .
SETH: Be glad , you 're still alive .
PETER: I am .
OPERATOR RECORDING: The number you have called has been disconnected and is no longer in service .
PETER: Fuck .
SETH: Hello .
PETER: I ca n't hear you .
SETH: What .
PETER: Go outside , I ca n't hear you .
SETH: Wait Give me a sec OK .
PETER: Where are you ?
SETH: Lugo .
PETER: Are you with Will ?
SETH: Emerson ?
PETER: Yes .
SETH: I think he 's still here . Why ?
PETER: You have to go get him , and get back up here .
SETH: Where ?
PETER: The office .
SETH: What !
PETER: I 'm serious .
SETH: You want me to get our boss 's boss out of a club and bring him back to the office at 10 00 on a Thursday night ?
PETER: Our boss just got axed , so technically he is our boss , and yes .
SETH: Why ?
PETER: Just do it Seth .
SETH: Alright , we 'll be there in ten .
WILL EMERSON: Hey , look who it is , burning the candle at both ends . There are n't anymore cuts planned though , so you can stop kissing my ass , honestly I do n't even understand what you guys do .
PETER: Will , I am so sorry to call you back but I really think..
WILL EMERSON: Do n't worry about it .
SETH: Hey .
PETER: Look at this . SETH comes around and sits at PETER 'S desk . PETER Eric gave me this file before he left .
SETH: Eric ?
PETER: Dale . And he told me he could n't quite figure it out , then the last thing he says as the doors on the elevator close is ` be careful ' .
WILL EMERSON: Be careful ?
PETER: So I 'm obviously a little curious . So I get into it a bit and I realize that all he was missing waswell it 's not good .
SETH: What is he doing here ?
PETER: Go to model four , and it makes more sense .
SETH: Oh .
WILL EMERSON: What is this ?
PETER: This is basically everything that we have on our books at any given time . But what Eric was trying to do here is work it fo levels of volatility that fall outside the limits of our standard VAR model .
WILL EMERSON: What are those levels .
PETER: Well it 's a fairly complicated
WILL EMERSON: Simplify .
PETER: The volatility boundaries are basically set using historic patterns then stretching them out another 10-15 % oughly .
WILL EMERSON: So what 's happening ?
SETH: We are starting to test those historic patterns .
WILL EMERSON: When ?
PETER: Today .
SETH: Tuesday .
PETER: Monday , last Friday , last Wednesday and Monday .
SETH: Two Fridays ago .
WILL EMERSON: I get it . SETH scrolls the final page on the graph .
SETH: Fuck me Once this thing gets going in the wrong direction
PETER: Yeah
SETH: It 's huge .
WILL EMERSON: How huge ?
SETH: The losses are greater than the current value of the company ?
PETER: Projected losses projected
SETH: Fuck me .
PETER: Yeah .
WILL EMERSON: Wait , and this is just our floor ?
PETER: Yeah They all look at each other long and hard .
WILL EMERSON: Where the fuck is Eric Dale ?
PETER: I ca n't find him , they cut off his phone .
WILL EMERSON: What ?
PETER: They turned off everyone 's phone who they axed today .
WILL EMERSON: Fucking ruthless . And he 's got no othe cell ?
PETER: No .
WILL EMERSON: How does he not have his own cellphone ?
PETER: I tried , it 's been turned off .
WILL EMERSON: I think I have his home number .
PETER: You 're going to call his house ?
WILL EMERSON: Yes Do we even know if he 's right ?
PETER: It seems pretty fucking right to me .
SETH: It does .
WILL EMERSON: Hello , Mrs. Dale ? This is Will Emerson calling I 'm fine , thanks . I was wondering if Eric was there ? Yes , we tried but his cell does n't seem to be working
SETH: Does n't he have like three kids ?
WILL EMERSON: So ?
SETH: I 'm just saying , would you go home ?
WILL EMERSON: I know where he is . You two need to go get him .
PETER: Now ?
WILL EMERSON: Yes .
PETER: What are you going to do ?
WILL EMERSON: I 'm calling Sam .
PETER: Fuck me .
WILL EMERSON: Go .
SAM ROGERS: It 's 11 00 at night ?
WILL EMERSON: I know I 'm sorry . I would n't have called
SAM ROGERS: What 's the problem ?
WILL EMERSON: I think you need to get down here .
SAM ROGERS: What ?
WILL EMERSON: Sam
SAM ROGERS: It 's 11 00 o'clock .
WILL EMERSON: I am well aware of the fucking time , Sam . But you need to see this .
SAM ROGERS: See what ?
WILL EMERSON: Well
SAM ROGERS: Email it to me .
WILL EMERSON: I do n't think that is a good idea . WILL 'S last words hang in the air .
SAM ROGERS: I 'm on my way .
SETH: You want one ?
PETER: No . PETER gives him a bit of a look .
SETH: What , we got them on our way to meet you at the office we did n't know what the fuck you wanted to talk about thought you might 've gotten some chick pregnant or something .
PETER: I have n't gotten laid in so long that 's not possible at this point .
SETH: I guess that 's true .
PETER: Look at these people .
SETH: What ?
PETER: We are in here stressing our fucking heads off that the world as we know it is ending , and they 've got no idea what 's coming .
SETH: I try not to let work get to me .
PETER: I 've noticed that about you actually .
SETH: Look , we are twenty three years old
PETER: Twenty-Seven .
SETH: Whatever , same thing , I made almost a quarter of a million dollars last year for what pushing some numbers around on a computer screen , so a bunch of glorified crack addicts could take that information and pretend to understand it , and then make a bet against some othe jock half way around the world who if he was n't doing this would probably be in some OTB somewhere putting it all on number seven . And at the end of the day one guy loses and the other guy wins .
PETER: You do know it 's a little more complicated than that ?
SETH: It 's Will He wants to know if we 've found him ? What do I tell him .
PETER: Tell him that we have n't found him .
SAM ROGERS: Hey .
WILL EMERSON: Hey .
SAM ROGERS: So ?
WILL EMERSON: Eric Dale
SAM ROGERS: Oh Jesus
WILL EMERSON: Before he was escorted out of the uilding by security
SAM ROGERS: I had nothing to do with that .
WILL EMERSON: I know .
SAM ROGERS: I 'm sorry , go on .
WILL EMERSON: So as he was leaving the building he hands a disk to Peter Sullivan
SAM ROGERS: Who 's Peter Sullivan again ?
WILL EMERSON: One of Eric 's guys .
SAM ROGERS: Right .
WILL EMERSON: and tells him that he was almost on to something but has n't been able to figure it out . So he gives him the disk and says give it a try but the last thing he says as the doors to the elevator close is ` be careful '
SAM ROGERS: Be careful ?
WILL EMERSON: Yeah .
SAM ROGERS: Be careful ?
WILL EMERSON: Yes .
SAM ROGERS: Why ?
WILL EMERSON: Well take a look .
SAM ROGERS: Speak , you know I ca n't read those fucking things they put together .
WILL EMERSON: Basically the kid dives right into the thing after your little pep talk , nice job by the way , and he seems to have nailed it .
SAM ROGERS: Nailed it ?
WILL EMERSON: The kid figured out what Eric was missing . And
SAM ROGERS: And ? WILL gives him a long pause .
WILL EMERSON: it is n't good .
SAM ROGERS: How ugly ?
WILL EMERSON: Real ugly .
SAM ROGERS: And how close to those limits have we gotten ?
WILL EMERSON: Oh we 're beyond close We broke through five or six days over the last two weeks , ut we 've managed to stay on the upside of it for now
SAM ROGERS: For now ?
WILL EMERSON: Well look what happens here when we get on the wrong side of it .
SAM ROGERS: What am I looking at ?
WILL EMERSON: And that would n't even be that bad a day for us historically speaking .
SAM ROGERS: Is this right ?
WILL EMERSON: I do n't know .
SAM ROGERS: Where is Eric ?
WILL EMERSON: We shut his phone off .
SAM ROGERS: Of course we did .
WILL EMERSON: And he has n't come home yet , I spoke to his wife .
SAM ROGERS: He 's probably crying in a fucking bee somewhere .
WILL EMERSON: Or worse .
SAM ROGERS: Where 's the kid who did this ?
WILL EMERSON: Out looking for Eric .
SAM ROGERS: Do we think he knows what he 's doing ?
WILL EMERSON: I do n't know . What do I know ?
SAM ROGERS: Well get him back here .
PETER: What now ?
SETH: We should probably tell Will he 's not here .
PETER: Yeah .
SETH: What do you think this girl makes in a night ?
PETER: Seth .
SETH: 1500 ?
SETH: He 's freaking out . We need to get down there .
PETER: I have no idea ?
SETH: Come on , play along .
PETER: I do n't know what year ?
SETH: Last year .
PETER: Three quarters of a million bucks ?
SETH: Come on .
PETER: What ?
SETH: Not even close .
PETER: More ?
SETH: Yes .
PETER: A million ?
SETH: Will Emerson made two and half million ucks last year .
PETER: Fuck you . SETH looks at him showing he is serious . PETER Fuck you !
SETH: He did .
PETER: How do you know that ?
SETH: He told me .
PETER: He just told you that ?
SETH: Well I asked him .
PETER: Do you think that 's true .
SETH: Probably .
PETER: That 's fucked up .
SETH: Why ?
PETER: Does that seem right to you ?
SETH: Right ?
PETER: Jesus .
SETH: So what do you think that means Rogers puts away ?
PETER: I have no idea .
WILL EMERSON: Gentlemen ?
SAM ROGERS: You 're coming with us .
SETH: Will . Mr. Rogers .
WILL EMERSON: Sam this is Seth Bregman and this is Peter Sullivan .
SETH: Sir .
SAM ROGERS: Guys .
PETER: Will ?
WILL EMERSON: Yes ?
PETER: Where are we going ?
SAM ROGERS: Going to get a second opinion on you work Peter .
ALL PRESENT: Slight hellos , etc .
JARED COHEN: So Sam , what do you have for us ?
SAM ROGERS: Well it should be here in a minute . Finding someone in the copy room at this hour was a little bit of a challenge .
JARED COHEN: Well why do n't we start by introducing everyone then .
SAM ROGERS: OK .
JARED COHEN: This is Sarah Robertson who you know , ou chief risk management officer , Ramesh Shah from upstairs , and David Horn one of the firm 's in house counsel .
SAM ROGERS: Nice to meet you all . This is Will Emerson my head of trading , and this is
WILL EMERSON: Peter Sullivan , and Seth Bregman . They work in our risk department .
JARED COHEN: Where is Eric Dale ?
SAM ROGERS: He was let go today .
JARED COHEN: So who 's left in your risk department ?
WILL EMERSON: As of today that would be Peter and ou junior analyst Seth ?
JARED COHEN: Really ?
WILL EMERSON: Here . Please just give one to everyone , thanks .
SAM ROGERS: So apparently Eric had been working on this for some time but was unable to finish it , as he was leaving the building today he gave the program to Peter here , and told him to see what he thought . Peter figured a few things out that Eric seemed to be missing and this is what came out .
JARED COHEN: Where is Eric Dale now ?
SAM ROGERS: He 's been unreachable since he left the office .
SARAH ROBERTSON: Peter this is your work ?
PETER: Mainly Mr. Dale 's
SARAH ROBERTSON: But this draft is yours ?
PETER: Yes . Again , derived from Mr. Dale 's original model . But yes .
SARAH ROBERTSON: And what is your background ?
PETER: Background ?
SARAH ROBERTSON: Your CV .
PETER: I have been with the firm for two years working with Eric that whole time But I hold a doctorate in engineering , specialist in propulsion , from MIT , with a Bachelors from Penn .
JARED COHEN: What 's a specialty in propulsion ?
PETER: Well in laymen terms my thesis was a study in the way that friction ratios effect steering outcomes in aeronautical use under reduced gravity loads . Long silence .
JARED COHEN: So you are a rocket scientist ?
PETER: Um I was yes .
JARED COHEN: How did you end up here ?
PETER: Well it 's all just numbers really , you 're just changing what you 're adding up and if I may speak freely the money is considerably more attractive here .
JARED COHEN: What time is it ?
RAMESH: It 's 2 15 .
JARED COHEN: What do you have in exposure right now , tonight ?
SAM ROGERS: I do n't know between 900 and 1.3 oughly .
RAMESH: If Mr. Sullivan 's numbers are correct
PETER: 1.215 Trillion . RAMESH checks his number .
RAMESH: Yes .
JARED COHEN: Fuck me fuck me And I 'm guessing by the fact that you two have n't said anything that the math checks out ?
SARAH ROBERTSON: Look we 'd need a little more time to go over this , but Mr. Sullivan here seems to know what he 's doing . And I do n't have to tell you that this is a problem .
JARED COHEN: Thank you for that . What time is it ?
RAMESH: 2 16 .
JARED COHEN: Fuck me !
SAM ROGERS: What ?
JARED COHEN: The 1.2 trillion .
SAM ROGERS: All of it ?
JARED COHEN: Yes .
SAM ROGERS: I do n't know , a couple weeks ?
JARED COHEN: Weeks ?
SAM ROGERS: Yes . But as you certainly know ou usiness is selling AND buying . It does n't work for very long without both components . If we suddenly stop buying for a day or two that just does n't hide under the rug , it gets out and this whole this thing comes to a end and right quick .
JARED COHEN: I understand .
SAM ROGERS: Do you ?
JARED COHEN: How many traders do we have left between your floor and Petersen 's ?
SAM ROGERS: I do n't know , sixty .
RAMESH: Jared I 've just been looking here a little closer , and it 's these VAR numbers that are really setting this thing off .
JARED COHEN: Excuse me , I need to make a quick call .
RAMESH: I was just saying , and just speaking completely off the record here , it wo n't e long before someone else starts putting these in and sees the exact same thing we are looking at here . If they have n't already . Pause .
JARED COHEN: Understood And Sarah , what value would you allow to be placed on those assets that might be left on the books , if they had to be ?
SARAH ROBERTSON: Why would they still be on the books ?
SAM ROGERS: Because suddenly no one wants to buy them .
JARED COHEN: Oh fuck you Sam give me a fucking eak , all at once ?
SARAH ROBERTSON: Without an active market , it could take weeks , months for me to value them correctly . You 'd have to go block by lock .
SAM ROGERS: It 's a very simple business Jared . You and I talked about this last year JARED turns around suddenly and cuts him off .
JARED COHEN: Sam . Will , Peter , and.. ? ?
SETH: Seth .
JARED COHEN: Seth , Could you please excuse us for a few minutes . They stand up and start to exit the room . JARED COHEN Oh and Peter ? Who else has seen this ?
PETER: No one besides us here .
JARED COHEN: And Mr. Dale .
PETER: Yes .
JARED COHEN: And can it really be that we do n't know where Eric Dale is ?
WILL EMERSON: I 'm afraid so . His wife tells us he has n't come home yetand the firm shut off his phone today .
JARED COHEN: Perfect . Well , I need to know where he is .
SETH: Jesus fucking Christ ! Who is that guy ?
WILL EMERSON: He 's Sam 's boss .
SETH: He looks like he 's fifteen years old . How old is he ?
WILL EMERSON: He 's like forty .
PETER: How does that happen ?
WILL EMERSON: Oh it happens all the time . Except to me . Kid 's a fucking killer .
PETER: What are they talking about ?
WILL EMERSON: It ai n't pretty .
SETH: What ai n't pretty ?
WILL EMERSON: If people suddenly stop buying the shit we 're selling . They all look out the window . Long pause . WILL EMERSON You guys smoke ? Well , you should .
SAM ROGERS: Jared you ca n't do what you are thinking about doing .
JARED COHEN: What if we do n't have a choice ?
SAM ROGERS: What does that mean ? Fuck you you do n't have a choice .
JARED COHEN: Fuck me ? Have you looked at these numbers Sam ? ?
SAM ROGERS: Yes , but what the hell do I know .
JARED COHEN: Well , Mr. Shah tell me if I 'm wrong but to me these numbers do n't add up .
RAMESH: If I may I 'd like to take some time efore we
SARAH ROBERTSON: Jared we ca n't answer that yet .
JARED COHEN: Are you fucking kidding me this is exactly what we 've SARAH now cuts him off abruptly .
SARAH ROBERTSON: We need a little time before we can give you our conclusion .
JARED COHEN: OK. We meet in 45 minutes .
RAMESH: Sam , do you have this file ?
SAM ROGERS: Yes , here it is .
JARED COHEN: And Sam we need Eric Dale , it 's making me very uneasy knowing he is out there right now wanting to put a knife in our backs while he 's not even aware he 's holding the knife in his hand .
SAM ROGERS: What are you going to do ?
JARED COHEN: Not sure .
SAM ROGERS: Are you going to call him ?
JARED COHEN: I already did .
SETH: Jesus .
PETER: Wow .
WILL EMERSON: Yeah .
SETH: Shit , that 's a long way down .
WILL EMERSON: Yeah , it is .
SARAH ROBERTSON: Is this really where you want to be taking this at this point ?
JARED COHEN: I 'm sorry ?
SARAH ROBERTSON: We do n't even know if he 's right .
JARED COHEN: How long should this take you to confirm ?
SARAH ROBERTSON: Not long .
JARED COHEN: OK
PETER: Careful .
SETH: Jesus man .
WILL EMERSON: Did you know the fear most people feel when they stand on the edge like this is not actually a fear that they will fall ut instead it 's the subconscious fearing that they might jump ? .It 's a fear of losing faith .
SETH: Well that 's a little deep and depressing , thank you .
WILL EMERSON: Yeah well , I can get a little dark sometimes .
SETH: Will , come on . Get down .
WILL EMERSON: Not today ! So it looks like they are gon na have us dump this shit .
SETH: What ?
WILL EMERSON: Yeah , you watch .
SETH: How ?
PETER: A trillion bucks ? ?
WILL EMERSON: I 'm just saying .
PETER: How would they even do that ?
WILL EMERSON: You ca n't it 's impossible . But they 'll figure out a way . I 've been at this place for ten years and I 've seen some things that you would n't believe and when all is said and done they do n't lose money . They do n't care if everyone else does , but they wo n't . Long silence .
SETH: Will ?
WILL EMERSON: Yeah ?
SETH: Did you really make two and half million ucks last year ?
WILL EMERSON: Yeah I did .
PETER: What do you do with all that money ?
WILL EMERSON: I do n't know really . It goes pretty quick . You learn to spend what 's in you pocket .
SETH: Two and a half million goes quickly ?
WILL EMERSON: Well the tax man takes half of it up front . So now you got what million and a quarter . Mortgage grabs another 300K , I gave 150 to my parents to live off , so now you got what ? ?
PETER: Eight hundred .
WILL EMERSON: I bought a car last year for 150 . Probably another 100 eating 25 on clothes , put 400 away for a rainy day
SETH: Smart .
WILL EMERSON: And what 's that ?
PETER: 125 left .
WILL EMERSON: I spent 76,520 dollars on booze , dancers , and whores .
PETER: 76,520 ?
WILL EMERSON: Yeah , kinda shocked me , although I was able to write most of it off , as entertainment .
SETH: 3 30 !
WILL EMERSON: Oh , here they go . They are bringing in the cavalry ! We better get down there .
SAM ROGERS: How old are you ?
JARED COHEN: 43 .
SAM ROGERS: Jesus
JARED COHEN: This is a very very bad dream . SAM looks over at him directly .
SAM ROGERS: I do n't know , seems like we actually may have just finally woken up .
SARAH ROBERTSON: Hello .
JARED COHEN: Come in .
SAM ROGERS: How do we look ? Her look says it all . SAM ROGERS I should go .
SARAH ROBERTSON: No , you should stay .
JARED COHEN: So ?
SARAH ROBERTSON: It 's all legit the kid killed it . The formula is worthless .
JARED COHEN: What do you mean ?
SARAH ROBERTSON: It 's broken .
JARED COHEN: There are eight trillion dollars of pape around the world relying on that equation ? ?
SARAH ROBERTSON: We were wrong .
JARED COHEN: You mean you were wrong .
SARAH ROBERTSON: Do n't even start . This was discussed .
SAM ROGERS: I 'm heading to the conference room .
SARAH ROBERTSON: No .
JARED COHEN: I 'd like you to hear this .
SAM ROGERS: No I do n't want to hear this . SAM stares at them both . SAM ROGERS How do you think I 've stuck around this place so long .
JARED COHEN: I 've called Tuld .
SARAH ROBERTSON: Is there a contingency plan here ?
JARED COHEN: A contingency plan ?
SARAH ROBERTSON: Yes .
JARED COHEN: We went all in on this one .
SARAH ROBERTSON: So we 've got ourselves quite exposed here have n't we ?
JARED COHEN: To Tuld or the market ?
SARAH ROBERTSON: Both .
WILL EMERSON: We were just grabbing a cigarette on the oof and a very spiffy looking helicopte dive-bombed us and then landed .
JARED COHEN: I know . Come with us . Where 's Sam .
WILL EMERSON: I do n't know . Do you want all of us
JARED COHEN: Yes .
ASSISTANT: Mr. Cohen ?
JARED COHEN: Yes .
ASSISTANT: This way . They are already in there waiting for you .
JARED COHEN: OK .
JOHN TULD: Please sit down .
JARED COHEN: Well , Mr. Tuld as I mentioned earlier if you look here at the top page of this printout He cuts him off .
JOHN TULD: Jared , it 's a little early for all that , how bout in English ? Actually I 'd like to hear from the guy who put this thing together Mr. Sullivan is it ? Does he speak English ?
JARED COHEN: Sir ?
JOHN TULD: I 'd like to speak to the analyst who seems to have stumbled across this mess .
JARED COHEN: Well , that 's Peter Sullivan here .
PETER: Sir .
JOHN TULD: Ah , there he is .
PETER: Yes sir .
JOHN TULD: How old are you Mr. Sullivan ?
PETER: I 'm twenty-seven sir .
JOHN TULD: Please call me John .
PETER: Yes sir .
JOHN TULD: So Mr. Sullivan why do n't you tell me what you think is going on here , and please speak as you might to a young child or a golden retriever , I did n't get here on my brains I can assure you of that . PETER is very nervous .
PETER: Well , sir . As I guess you may or may not know I work for Mr. Rogers here as an associate in the risk assessment and management office at MBS
JOHN TULD: Now you lost me at M
PETER: Sorry
JOHN TULD: I was joking Mr. Sullivan .
PETER: Yes Well as you probably know over the last 36-40 months the firm has begun packaging new MBS products that combine several different traunches of rating classification in one tradable security . This has been very profitable as I imagine you noticed .
JOHN TULD: I have .
PETER: Well the firm is currently doing a considerable amount of this business every day . The problem , which is I guess why we are here tonight , is that it takes us the firm almost a month to laye these products correctly thereby posing a challenge from a risk management standpoint .
JOHN TULD: And Mr. Sullivan that challenge is ?
PETER: We have to hold these assets on our books longer than we might ideally like to .
JOHN TULD: Yes .
PETER: But the key factor is these are essentially just mortgages , so that has allowed us to push the leverage considerably beyond what you might be willing , or allowed to do in any othe circumstance , thereby pushing the risk profile without raising any red flags .
JOHN TULD: And how far have we pushed that profile tonight Mr. Sullivan ?
PETER: We have pushed it to 1.215 Trillion dollars at MBS alone .
JOHN TULD: Give or take .
PETER: Give or take .
JOHN TULD: Now Mr. Sullivan what I am guessing , and give me a little rope here , what I am guessing that your report here says is that considering the , shall we say bumpy oad , we 've been on the last week or so that the numbers that your brilliant co- workers up the line ahead of you had come up with in the past do n't seem to make much sense anymore considering what 's taking place today ?
PETER: Actually not taking place today but what 's already taken place over the last two weeks .
JOHN TULD: So what you 're saying is it 's already happened ?
PETER: Sort of .
JOHN TULD: And Mr. Sullivan what does your model say that means for us here ?
PETER: Well , that 's where it becomes a projection . But
JOHN TULD: You 're speaking with me Mr. Sullivan .
PETER: Well sir if those assets were to decrease by just 25 percent , and remain on our books well that loss would e greater than the current market capitalization of this company .
JOHN TULD: So what you 're telling me Mr. Sullivan is that the music appears to be about to stop and we are going to be holding the iggest bag of stinking shit eve assembled in the history of capitalism ? Everyone looks back at PETER . JOHN TULD Mr. Sullivan ?
PETER: Well sir , I 'm not sure I 'd put it that way but let me clarify using you analogy , what this model shows is the music , so to speak , just slowing , if the music were to stop , as you put it , then this model would not be even close to that scenario . It would be considerably worse .
JOHN TULD: Well let me tell you something Mr. Sullivan . Do you want to know why I 'm sitting here in this chair with you all , why I get the big bucks , so to speak ?
PETER: Yes .
JOHN TULD: I 'm here for one reason and one reason only .
JARED COHEN: Sell it all today JOHN TULD smiles just a bit . Then turns .
JOHN TULD: Is that even possible Sam ?
SAM ROGERS: It is , but at what cost ?
JOHN TULD: I 'll pay .
SAM ROGERS: Really ? JOHN and SAM look and read each other .
JOHN TULD: I think so .
SAM ROGERS: Almost a trillion bucks of paper ?
JOHN TULD: Where does it come back to us ?
SAM ROGERS: Everywhere .
JOHN TULD: Sam , I do n't think you seem to understand what your boy down here just said if I made you how would you do it ?
SAM ROGERS: You bring the traders in for their normal 6 30 meeting and you be honest with them , they 're gon na know it 's the end eithe way , so you 'd have to throw them a bone , and a pretty big one . You 'd have to come out of the gate storming 40 percent done by 10 15 and 70 percent of you positions need to be gone by eleven , cause by lunch the word will be out . No swaps , no nothing , and by two o'clock you 'll be getting 65 cents on the dollar , if you 're lucky , and the feds will be in here looking up your ass and trying to slow us down .
JOHN TULD: Ramesh ? He looks to RAMESH SHAH down the table .
RAMESH: They 'll slow you down but it 's yours to sell . They ca n't stop you .
SAM ROGERS: John let 's just say we pull that off , which is saying something the real question is who are we selling this to ?
JOHN TULD: The same people you 've been selling this to for the last two years and whoeve else will buy it .
SAM ROGERS: If you do this you 've killed that market for years . It 's over .
SAM ROGERS: And you are selling something you know has no value .
JOHN TULD: We are selling to willing buyers at the current fair market price , so that WE may survive , Sam .
SAM ROGERS: You 'll never sell a thing to any one of them again .
JOHN TULD: I understand .
SAM ROGERS: Do you ?
JOHN TULD: Do you ! ! ! This is it , Sam , this is it !
PETER: Eric Dale .
JOHN TULD: Where is Eric Dale ?
SARAH ROBERTSON: As of today he is no longer with the firm .
JARED COHEN: We have been trying to locate him .
JOHN TULD: So he is just out there with this information ?
JOHN TULD: Carmelo ?
LOUIS CARMELO: Yes .
JOHN TULD: Get me Eric Dale here by 6 30 .
LOUIS CARMELO: Done .
JOHN TULD: OK , meet back here in an hour . Everyone stands up and begins to scatter . JOHN TULD Sam let 's talk . JOHN TULD leads SAM through the back door .
JOHN TULD: Hell of a town is n't it ?
SAM ROGERS: Never really did it for me actually .
JOHN TULD: Really ?
SAM ROGERS: Always been kinda a grass and tree guy .
JOHN TULD: I 've always loved this place . Ever since I arrived . Everything about it .
SAM ROGERS: I ca n't say I feel that about anyplace actually .
JOHN TULD: Are you going to be able to come on board here Sam ? They look at each other .
SAM ROGERS: I 'm not sure John . This is really ugly .
JOHN TULD: You and I are salesmen Sam , we sell . That 's what we do . It 's not complicated .
SAM ROGERS: Exactly . And you damn well know that you do n't make a sale unless you think the guy is gon na come back for more , and tomorrow we are done .
JOHN TULD: This is it Sam .
SAM ROGERS: You keep saying that , what is that supposed to mean ?
JOHN TULD: It 's the big one . Most of us are n't gon na make it out of this one .
SAM ROGERS: Us ?
JOHN TULD: The street .
SAM ROGERS: What are you talking about ?
JOHN TULD: This wo n't be the last ` situation ' I will e having this week . It 's just the start .
SAM ROGERS: It 's only the start because we are starting it .
JOHN TULD: Maybe . But I do n't think that 's true , not this time . The numbers just do n't add up anymore .
SAM ROGERS: Well I agree with you there , I 've been saying that for years .
JOHN TULD: I mean if this kid can come up with this ?
SAM ROGERS: I do n't think I can go in knowing what I know and put the hammer down on these guys like this .
JOHN TULD: Oh please , when did you become so soft .
SAM ROGERS: Fuck you soft , you 're panicking .
JOHN TULD: If you 're the first one out the door Sam , it 's not called panicking JOHN TULD stares aggressively at SAM .
SAM ROGERS: Look , I obviously do n't have all the information that you do . But I think this could destroy this firm .
JOHN TULD: You let me take care of that . SAM heads out the door .
WILL EMERSON: How 'd that go ?
SAM ROGERS: This is a fucking shit show .
WILL EMERSON: They are going to do it ?
SAM ROGERS: Probably .
WILL EMERSON: Jesus .
SAM ROGERS: Remember this day boys , remember this day .
ASSISTANT: Gentlemen , there is some breakfast down the hall if you guys are hungry . WILL looks at the guys .
WILL EMERSON: Seth , someone is going to have to get eakfast . And let 's face it , it 's you .
SARAH ROBERTSON: So what 's the strategy here ?
JARED COHEN: That 's where I 'm headed right now , downstairs to work on it with my guys .
SARAH ROBERTSON: No , you and I with Tuld .
JARED COHEN: I 'm not sure we need one , Sarah . That 's not the way I 've ever done this .
SARAH ROBERTSON: Please .
JARED COHEN: He knows where we both have stood on this all along . There 's nothing more to do . This pushes a button with her .
SARAH ROBERTSON: That 's exactly my point , and knowing what was discussed by both you and I with him , I do n't see how that can possibly you with anything but a false sense of comfort .
JARED COHEN: I 'm not looking for a sense of comfort here , Sarah . I do n't think there is one to be found .
SARAH ROBERTSON: So again , what 's the strategy here ?
JARED COHEN: On this particular front , I 'm just not sure there 's much left to do .
SARAH ROBERTSON: It 's very simple . Do n't even think of fucking me on this one , because if we are going down you damn well know its going to be together . Jared looks at her for a long beat .
JARED COHEN: No , I 'm not sure I do know that . The doors close .
SETH: What do you think Tuld made last year ?
PETER: Would you shut the fuck up . WILL speaks with food in his mouth .
WILL EMERSON: 86 mil . in salary and bonus .
PETER: Really ?
WILL EMERSON: Yeah , it 's public record .
SETH: That 's a lot of fucking money .
WILL EMERSON: He was worth a billion .
PETER: Was ?
WILL EMERSON: Before today .
SETH: Really ?
WILL EMERSON: You 'll see .
PETER: .I think I 'm going to go get a coffee , does anyone need anything .
PETER: I need a little real air .
SETH: Probably a good idea .
PETER: Will , is that alright ?
WILL EMERSON: Alright ?
PETER: If I get out of here for a minute ?
WILL EMERSON: Yeah . Are you kidding ? It 's not a prison . Do you want me to hold your hand ?
SAM ROGERS: What ?
WILL EMERSON: That was Eric 's wife . He 's alive , he 's home . He does n't want to talk to us . And he does n't know she called me . They all look to SAM to see what to do .
SAM ROGERS: Where 's he live ?
WILL EMERSON: The heights . SAM ROGERS looks at his watch .
SAM ROGERS: No it 's Eric the last thing we need is those guys going over there , you two go try to get him . SAM points to WILL and SETH . SAM ROGERS But you 've got to be back here by 6 00 .
WILL EMERSON: OK .
JOHN TULD: May I come in ?
SARAH ROBERTSON: Please , sit .
JOHN TULD: So we are going to do this thing .
SARAH ROBERTSON: OK .
JOHN TULD: It 's going to be tight .
SARAH ROBERTSON: Is Sam on board ?
JOHN TULD: Not yet . TULD pauses . JOHN TULD Sarah , I need a head to feed to these traders and the board this morning . SARAH looks up .
SARAH ROBERTSON: Is it me or Cohen ?
JOHN TULD: It 's you .
SARAH ROBERTSON: Of course you are well aware I filtered several warnings for you and Cohen over a year ago on this ?
JOHN TULD: I 'm not sure that 's the best path for you to be taking at this point you 're going to be taken care of here
JOHN TULD: Obviously it 's quite complicated .
SARAH ROBERTSON: John I was told that in no uncertain terms
JOHN TULD: It was all a very grey area .
SARAH ROBERTSON: It was actually made very clear at the time , by you and I and Cohen .
JOHN TULD: I 'd really prefer that you did n't fight me on this TULD pauses , they look at each other . JOHN TULD We all fucked this one up pretty good
SARAH ROBERTSON: Yes .
JOHN TULD: We need you to stay here till this is all done and the markets close .
SARAH ROBERTSON: I understand .
JOHN TULD: They 'll go over the numbers with you downstairs Good luck .
SETH: Ah fuck , it 's Jared . He 's coming this way .
WILL: What does wonderboy want ? WILL stands up and walks over to JARED .
JARED COHEN: Do you have a minute ?
WILL: We 're heading to get Eric Dale .
JARED COHEN: I know . I just need a second . THEY walk away from SETH .
WILL: What is it ?
JARED COHEN: Tuld and I have concerns that Sam may not e willing to step up and do the right thing here .
WILL: I do n't think that 's ever been a problem .
JARED COHEN: Of course it has n't , but during acute situations , such as this , often what is ight can take on multiple interpretations .
WILL: Sam will step up .
JARED COHEN: I know he willbut if he does n't
WILL: That I will what ?
JARED COHEN: Step up .
WILL: I have no doubt Sam will make the right choice . And if it makes you feel any etter he and I have always had the same interpretation of what 's rightno matter how acute the situation .
JOHN TULD: There he is .
SAM ROGERS: John .
JOHN TULD: Cohen has done a nice job . It can work .
SAM ROGERS: What does that mean ?
JOHN TULD: It means , as you very well know , that you are a very important piece of this puzzle . They look directly at each other . JOHN TULD Here .
SAM ROGERS: That 's very generous .
JOHN TULD: It 's not a gift . I need to know you are with me on this .
SAM ROGERS: I 'm with the firm John .
JOHN TULD: I wo n't get what I need out of your boys today unless they believe you unless they believe in you completely . He stares at SAM . JOHN TULD Are you in ?
SAM ROGERS: I told you I have my reservations .
JOHN TULD: Well you ca n't have any reservations . They both stare at each other . JOHN TULD And I need to know now .
SAM ROGERS: I 'm with the firm completely John , as I always have been . Excuse me .

WILL EMERSON: You are such a prick , and it was n't .
SETH: I think I should stay here .
WILL EMERSON: Get out of the fucking car .
SETH: I just do n't think it would be appropriate .
WILL EMERSON: Appropriate ? Get the fuck out of the car .
SETH: Really ?
WILL EMERSON: You 're probably right And do n't touch any of the fucking buttons .
ERIC: What are you doing here ?
WILL EMERSON: Peter finished that model you were working on .
ERIC: Really ?
WILL EMERSON: It 's created a bit of a shit storm .
ERIC: Yeah , I bet .
WILL EMERSON: Do you want to see it the model ?
ERIC: No .
WILL EMERSON: Really ?
ERIC: No . But I 'm pretty sure what it says .
WILL EMERSON: Do you think he 's right ?
ERIC: I 'm sure he 's right . They both sit down on the stoop .
WILL EMERSON: Jared Cohen called an emergency meeting of the partners tonight . John Tuld has decided to liquidate our entire position . ERIC looks over at Will WILL EMERSON Today .
ERIC: Well , I am very sorry to hear that .

ERIC: A bridge .

ERIC: I was an engineer by trade .
WILL EMERSON: Well

ERIC: Thanks for stopping by .

WILL EMERSON: Tuld does n't want any loose ends .
ERIC: They fired me Will . Fuck em Fuck em .
WILL EMERSON: Just come back with them , take the bonus , and you 're home tonight by five . Eithe that or they are going to fight you on everything , the package , the options ERIC drops his head .

SETH: So , am I getting fired ?
WILL EMERSON: I do n't know .
SETH: Are you ?
WILL EMERSON: No .
SETH: Oh .
WILL EMERSON: It 's not personal , you 're just in the wrong place at the wrong time , the young guys are always the first to go . Nothing I say is gon na make you feel any better .
SETH: I get it .
WILL EMERSON: The first time I made 36 million dollars for the firm in the last eleven minutes of the trading day .
SETH: Fuck me .
WILL EMERSON: It was a perfect tradeI saw it coming from three days away . I took my time . I was in , I was outPish poshAnd it was beautiful .

SETH: Do n't be , you 're not doing it to me .
WILL EMERSON: I knowbut I 'm still sorry . At least you 'll have some decent cash to walk away with .
SETH: Only if we can get this done , right ?
WILL EMERSON: We 'll get it done .
SETH: How ?
WILL EMERSON: I 'm trying to figure that out right now .
SETH: There are n't really enough willing buyers out there right now .
WILL EMERSON: I 'm trying to think of every last one of them I can and then I 'll make them willing .
SETH: Are you ok with that ?
WILL EMERSON: I 'm about to completely fuck guys I 've een doing business with for fifteen years so no I 'm not exactly ok with it . But look , every last one of them would do the same thing to me in a secondso it is what it is .
SETH: I guess . And what about everyone else ?

ERIC: Have they taken all the phones out of this room ? SARAH nods yes . ERIC Jesus . Paranoid fucks .
SARAH ROBERTSON: Yeah I did n't think they were going to e able to get you back here . ERIC stands up and goes over to the window .
ERIC: They told me they were going to drag me through hell on everything from my options to healthcare over the next two years or I come back and make $ 176,471.00 an hour to sit in this room quietly it was n't much of choice .
SARAH ROBERTSON: It never is . ERIC goes back and sits in the chair . SARAH ROBERTSON Obviously looking back , the point was expressed with insufficient urgency
ERIC: OK .
SARAH ROBERTSON: Eric .
ERIC: I understand , there was nothing you could do . Now SARAH questions herself .
SARAH ROBERTSON: I guess at the time it did n't seem like there was much of a choice .
ERIC: It never does .
SARAH ROBERTSON: You have kids , yeah ? Long pause as he lets her alone .
ERIC: What is your package going to look like ?
SARAH ROBERTSON: I do n't know , that 's what I 'm waiting fo now .
ERIC: Should be pretty good , no ?
SARAH ROBERTSON: It better be .
WILL EMERSON: Alright , hey .
SAM ROGERS: Thank you all for coming in a little early this morning , I know yesterday was pretty bad , I wish I could say that today is going to be less so but that is n't going to be the case . Now I am supposed to read this statement here to you all ut how bout you read it on your own time and I 'll just tell you what the fuck 's going on here .
JOHN TULD: By the end of today almost everyone else in the world , including me , will have considerably less money than they began the day with.. You , in this room , are the exception . You will leave here today icher . You will fire the first shot , I wish it did n't have to be , but at times the market must eat its weak , and you all are not the weak . We must strike quick , with no doubt , if you hear pause on the line , attack . By noon the SEC is going to be in here getting in you faces , sniffing around , you let us take care of them and you just keep going . We own what we are choosing to sell today and there is nothing they can do about it . 107 years ago this firm was founded , today we secure our place for next 107 . You 've got two minutes before we get started . Let 's finish this , so we can get on to the next one
JARED COHEN: Well done .
SAM ROGERS: They did alright .
JARED COHEN: I wanted to give you a heads up . They are going to start sending some people home out here .
SAM ROGERS: Now ?
JARED COHEN: Sorry . No loose ends .
SAM ROGERS: Of course .
JARED COHEN: For what it 's worth , you 're good Guess somebody upstairs must really like you .
JOHN TULD: Sam , please sit . Congratulations are clearly in order .
SAM ROGERS: Our guys did what they could .
JOHN TULD: You did a hell of a job today , and I thank you for it . Sit , excuse me fo eating but it 's been a long day . Can I get you anything ?
SAM ROGERS: No , no thanks .
TULD: So what can I do for you ?
SAM ROGERS: I want out .
TULD: I 'm sorry ?
SAM ROGERS: I 'm done , I want out .
TULD: It 's been a very difficult day , fo everyone .
SAM ROGERS: I need you to release my options , that is if they 're still worth anything afte today , and I need the bonus . I 'm out .
TULD: You 'll get the bonus , the options , and keep your current base , but I need you to stay with me for another 24 months . O.K ?
SAM ROGERS: That 's true , and if I had been at least there 'd be some holes in the ground to show for it . I 'm just not quite sure how we fucked this thing up so badly .
TULD: Jesus , when did you start feeling so sorry for yourself , it 's unbearable What , you think we may have helped put some people out of business today ? That it 's all just for naught ? Well you 've een doing that everyday for almost forty years Sam . And if all this is for naught then so is everything else out there . It 's just money , it 's made up , a piece of paper with some pictures on it so we do n't all kill each other trying to get something to eat . But it 's not wrong and it 's certainly not any different today than it 's ever been . Ever . 1637 , 1797 ,
SAM ROGERS: I 'll do it John , but not because of you little speech , but because I need the money . I 'm not sure how it could possibly e after all these years , but I need the money .
JOHN TULD: Keeping him ? He 's getting promoted . It 's all hands on deck now Sam , there 's going to be a lot of money to be made coming out of this mess , we 're going to need all the brains we can get around here .
MARY ROGERS: Hello ! I 've called the police .

CLAUDE: Here .
MARGOT: That was quick .
CLAUDE: I sat next to the wrong person .
MARGOT: Really ? Where ?
CLAUDE: Please do n't look . She 'll see you .
MARGOT: Careful with my blouse .
CLAUDE: Will the wedding be crowded ?
MARGOT: I do n't know . I think she does n't know anyone anymore .
CLAUDE: How long has she known Malcolm ?
MARGOT: Only a year .
CLAUDE: Is that short ?
MARGOT: Would you marry someone you 'd only known a year ?
CLAUDE: I 'm not going to ever get married .
MARGOT: I ca n't say I have a lot of hope for the whole thing .
CLAUDE: Why are we going then ?
MARGOT: We 're supporting her .
CLAUDE: I thought she was n't speaking to you .
MARGOT: NonoI was n't speaking to her , ut I 'm over it .
CLAUDE: I do n't think I need them right now .
MARGOT: You begged for those glasses .
CLAUDE: I know , butI will wear them , I just feel like people might think it 's weird that a kid is wearing dark shades .
MARGOT: That 's ridiculous .
CLAUDE: I do n't need them right now .
MALCOLM: Are you ?
MARGOT: I 'm sorry it was such short notice .
MALCOLM: I do n't care . Paul 's frantic , but I do n't give a shit . Oh , and Ingrid wants me to tell you that she made us all bracelets .
INGRID: No , I wantedI wanted to wait
MALCOLM: Oh , I thought you asked me to tell them . Anyway
INGRID: They 're not Knicks colors !
MARGOT: It 's beautiful , Ingrid .
INGRID: I made this one for myself .
CLAUDE: I guess .
INGRID: Where 's your dad and Josh ?
CLAUDE: They might come later .
MARGOT: Josh 's spring break is next week . Jim teaches through Friday and then they open the house in Vermont on the weekend .
MALCOLM: It means a lot to Pauline that you 're here . Margot nods awkwardly she blushes .
MARGOT: Oh . Good .
MALCOLM: Holy Jesus ! Watch it , dicksack !
MARGOT: No , I was n't .
MALCOLM: I had a full beard for a while and then when I shaved it I left this part for last , you know to see how it looked , and It 's meant to be funny .
PAULINE: You 're so handsome .
INGRID: It 's the Voglers .
PAULINE: The neighbors want us to cut down our tree .
MARGOT: No , that 's our tree !
INGRID: They think it 's sick and rotting their property .
PAULINE: We 're having the ceremony under it .
MARGOT: You took the swing down .
MALCOLM: Pauline thinks this is their way of trying to be friends . I think they esent us because we 're
INGRID: This is my room .
CLAUDE: Okay .
INGRID: Do you like showers or baths ?
CLAUDE: Showers . What about you ?
INGRID: I do n't care .
PAULINE: Is Malcolm what you thought he 'd e ?
MARGOT: Well , I did n't know what to
PAULINE: The moustache is temporary . He left it for last when he was shaving . It 's meant to be funny .
MARGOT: He told me .
PAULINE: Yeah
MARGOT: This was Becky 's room . Poor Becky .
PAULINE: Yeah , poor Becky . Now it 's a storage room . I 've just started to feel like it 's our house not my parents . You know ?
MARGOT: Our parents .
PAULINE: Of course . It might still smell like paint , but
MARGOT: I thought he was a musician .
PAULINE: Well , music 's officially a hobby He 's painting now . And writing letters to newspapers and magazines . He 's very meticulous , he 'll spend up to a week writing a esponse to a music review . He 's incredibly smart . Maybe too smart . I do n't know . We 're doing very well .
MARGOT: Good . I mean , you must be . Silence .
PAULINE: I do n't know where to begin . What can I tell you ? It seems I 'm pregnant , but it 's really early so I have n't told anyone . I mean , I have n't told Malcolm o Ingrid .
MARGOT: Wow
PAULINE: Yeah , if it sticks . We 'll see . I hope so . Things are good . We did a couples seminar two months ago o so in Maine . They give you exercises and things to do . I know you 're not convinced , but
MARGOT: Mm hm .
PAULINE: We got engaged right afterwards . The guy who runs it , Strickland , wrote a really interesting book about loving which I 'll lend you if you want .
MARGOT: Okay .
PAULINE: But only if you 'll read it . Because I need it back . I made notes in the margins .
MARGOT: I may not get to it for a while .
PAULINE: Well , I 'm not going to lend it to you if you 're not going to read it . They meet eyes . Pauline quickly turns away .
MARGOT: Becky 's coming ?
PAULINE: You go .
MARGOT: I was going to say , `` I 'd really like some white wine . ''
PAULINE: Oh . Yeah . We have a WellI 'm glad you changed you mind and came . I never heard from you after I sent the inviteI even wondered if you got it .
MARGOT: Well , I 'm so pleased we 're here .
PAULINE: Did you get it ?
MARGOT: Yeah . Pauline waits for an explanation .
PAULINE: I was n't angry . I wasdisappointed .
MARGOT: Uh huh . But you see when you say , `` disappointed '' it puts me in a crummy situation . Like I let you down .
PAULINE: But you did in a way .
MARGOT: I do n't see it like that .
PAULINE: Fine . I felt betrayed . Is that word okay ?
MARGOT: Again , you 're making me the aggressor .
PAULINE: You were the aggressor . Let 's not I 've become a really good cook .
MARGOT: I ca n't believe you 've still got all of our old records .
INGRID: Mom , can you hide this please .
PAULINE: Malcolm played with Ric Ocasek once ?
MALCOLM: In the late ` 80 's . It was a solo gig after he left the Cars .
CLAUDE: So , you 're kind of famous . Malcolm reddens .
MALCOLM: No . No . Believe me , I 'm not . I used to want to be , but , No . Do you want to be famous ?
MARGOT: Claude wants to be very famous .
MALCOLM: Well , make sure you can handle ejection . I ca n't . For me , expectation just turns to disappointment . So , ultimately I 'd ather not try . It 'll all go black for us soon enough anyway .
PAULINE: Claude , ignore him .
MARGOT: And the Pixies .
PAULINE: And X . She was very cool you mother .
MARGOT: You only liked top forty .
PAULINE: Yeah , but I love REM now .
MARGOT: I do n't really listen to music anymore .
PAULINE: I was dating that guy , Horace back then . Remember him ?
MARGOT: Was that the guy who liked to rough you up ?
PAULINE: No , that was our dad .
MARGOT: Our father used to strip down to his skivvies and beat us with a elt .
MALCOLM: That man had a sexual screw loose .
PAULINE: It 's awful that stuff that happens to kids . Malcolm was fondled by a male baby-sitter .
MALCOLM: Just use that information howeve you want
PAULINE: Sorry . We 're with family . I figured
MARGOT: Did she ever . Raped by the horse trainer
TOBY: Alan rolled over in bed and looked at me and he said I ca n't feel my face . It took three doctors before we knew it was Bells Palsy .
ALAN: They say a brush of wind can do it .
TOBY: Feeling is slowly coming back .
MALCOLM: We 're all getting older Which is terrible I do n't care how universal it is . I ca n't remembe names anymore .
MARGOT: I have that . I blank out on certain words now too . Like the other day , I could n't remember the word for I 've forgotten it again . The stuff in wine . Sediment ! That was it .
MALCOLM: I know that . I was talking more about not remembering who was the assist for Motley Crüe .
PAULINE: Ingrid , why do n't you show Claude and Bruce the game trunk .
INGRID: Okay .
MALCOLM: Mick Mars .
MARGOT: Toby , I think you need to have Bruce diagnosed .
TOBY: Margot , I do n't want to have this conversation with you .
MARGOT: It 's vital . If you keep telling him he 's like everyone else he 'll wonder why he is n't . He 's suffering .
TOBY: He 's tested very well . He does B 's in school .
MARGOT: But , that 's how autism works . One part of the brain can work fine while the other is damaged .
ALAN: We had him diagnosed , Margot . Nothing was found wrong .
MARGOT: Did you really , though ?
TOBY: I'mI 'm not going to have this conversation . I 'm sorry .
MARGOT: I know it must be so difficult fo you , but I think you have to
JIM'S VOICE: What are you doing ?
MARGOT: I left you a note .
JIM'S VOICE: Come back . Or meet me in Vermont on Saturday .
MARGOT: Nono . The wedding is on Saturday . I 'm here for that . I ca n't really pull out . How would that look ?
JIM'S VOICE: You have n't spoken to her in years -
MARGOT: Well , we 're speaking now . She is my closest friend despite it all You 're the one who 's been trying to get me to call her .
JIM'S VOICE: Did you tell Claude what you 're doing ?
MARGOT: Jim , this guy , Malcolm . He 's exactly what you 'd imagine except I think he 's clinically depressed .
MARGOT: Hello ?
JIM'S VOICE: You said you were n't a hundred percent on this . You said that like a week ago . Can I come up there ?
MARGOT: No . I do n't want to see you I feel happier already having done it .
JIM'S VOICE: Really ? You feel happier Please do n't tell Claude anything please , until we 've talked more .
MARGOT: I need to tell him . And we need to tell Josh . Did he do his homework ?
JIM'S VOICE: Yes .
MARGOT: This is happening and you have to get your mind around that .
CLAUDE: Yes .
MARGOT: Will you remember this ?
CLAUDE: Yes .
MARGOT: I just talked to your dad Claude 's eyes remained closed , but he smiles .
CLAUDE: Okay .
MARGOT: Everyone finds you so funny and charming . I always get compliments about you .
CLAUDE: Yeah , I really like her .
MARGOT: Yeah . She is crazy though .
CLAUDE: In what way ?
MARGOT: She 's really berserk . Maybe it 's hormones . You do n't notice anything different about Pauline ?
CLAUDE: No .
MARGOT: She 's pregnant she told me . But she 's keeping it a secret I mean from Malcolm and even Ingrid . Which I think is unforgiveable . Now she 'll have to marry him . What 's she planning to get married and not drink champagne ? Then she 'll just be lying . I guess she 's afraid she 'll miscarry . She probably will . I think on some level she 's ambivalent about the marriage and that 's why she 's not telling him .
CLAUDE: Are you stoned , Mom ?
MARGOT: Maybe a little .
CLAUDE: I do n't like it .
MALCOLM: My scrotum is longer than my penis .
PAULINE: What she did to Toby and Alan tonight did n't seem crazy enough for you ?
MALCOLM: I guess that seemed pretty crazy .
PAULINE: Well , she cares deeply .
MALCOLM: Yeah , she 's really worried about Bruce .
PAULINE: This has nothing to do with Bruce . She thinks everyone is autistic .
MALCOLM: Nothing , you keep changing you position I 'm just trying to figure out if I should agree with you or not ?
PAULINE: Well , ca n't she be both , care deeply and be crazy ? Do people have to be all one thing ?
MALCOLM: I guess not .
PAULINE: Well , okay It is nice she came for the wedding . She 's so pretty , do n't you think ?
MALCOLM: She 's attractive .
PAULINE: A little thin maybe But it is nice she came .
MALCOLM: Let 's fuck .
MARGOT: Honey , you 're up .
CLAUDE: Sorry .
MALCOLM: Paul , what are you doing ?
PAULINE: I 'm sending Claude 's ball into the ushes .
MALCOLM: Take the extra hit .
PAULINE: I do n't want to do that .
MALCOLM: It 's the smarter play .
PAULINE: Shit .
MALCOLM: Pauline ! See , I knew you could n't Your feet are too small !
MARGOT: You took the awnings down .
PAULINE: Well done .
MALCOLM: Fuck you .
MARGOT: Honey , you 're up .
CLAUDE: Oh .
MARGOT: So stupid .
CLAUDE: Mom , I 'm sorry . Jesus .
MARGOT: This is why I hate games . I hate what it does to me .
MALCOLM: Yeah , I kind of know what you mean .
MARGOT: I always think I have something in my hair . It 's not necessarily bad , Paul . It 's just something you do .
PAULINE: Claude have you ever seen you mother climb a tree ?
CLAUDE: No .
MARGOT: We do n't have much opportunity in Manhattan .
PAULINE: As kids Margot climbed everything . She could even climb that tree .
CLAUDE: Can you do it , mom ?
MARGOT: Maybe later .
CLAUDE: No , now .
INGRID: Do it now , Margot !
PAULINE: Show him , Margot .
MARGOT: Shit .
CLAUDE: What 's she doing now ?
PAULINE: She 's stuck .
MARGOT: I got it . She slowly lowers herself .
CLAUDE: You were great on the way up .
MARGOT: Do n't patronize me , Claude .
PAULINE: We 're all laughing , Margot .
MARGOT: You 're laughing in a kind way . Claude is taking too much pleasure out of it .
CLAUDE: I am not .
MARGOT: You are . You like to make fun of me . To see me get embarrassed . It 's mean .
PAULINE: What are you doing ?
MARGOT: I 've got a fucking bug in my ear , okay ?
PAULINE: I thought Claude could hand out programs . Ingrid 's going to sing . Do you want to read a poem o something ?
MARGOT: You know I ca n't speak in front of people . I 'm doing this `` conversation '' at the bookstore in town on Friday and I totally regret having said I 'd do it .
PAULINE: You 're doing a `` conversation ? ''
MARGOT: Yeah , talking about my work in front of a crowd . I did n't invite you becauseI thought it 'd be oring .
PAULINE: Uh huh .
MARGOT: What ? Say it .
PAULINE: It 's nothing . It 's justI would comeI want to come . I get a kick out of it . It 's just weird , you know So , you 're not here for Okay , I get it . When did they ask you ?
MARGOT: A while ago . I 'd said , No , but then when I was coming here anyway andI guess it helps sales andsoso .
PAULINE: I see .
MARGOT: Why ? Is she seeing someone ? She 's still obese , I assume .
PAULINE: I think it 's symbolic .
MARGOT: I bet mom paid for it . We should audit mom .
PAULINE: I considered it in my twenties . You know , when I was fucking everyone . You remember .
MARGOT: I did my share .
PAULINE: But not like me .
MARGOT: You want to count ?
PAULINE: No , Margot , I do n't want to count . What was it about Dad that had us fucking so many guys ?
MARGOT: I think it was the only time we could really feel unselfconscious and get out of our heads .
PAULINE: I do n't think that 's it . I just think it was something we were good at .
INGRID: Your mom thinks Bruce is gay .
CLAUDE: No , she said she had Aspergers .
INGRID: I thought that 's what that means .
CLAUDE: No , it 's like lesser retarded .
INGRID: I have adult ADD .
CLAUDE: You mean child ADD .
INGRID: No , for some reason I have the adult one . Maybe I 'm retarded .
MAN: Come on !
LITTLE GIRL: I do n't want to !
MAN: Come on !
LITTLE GIRL: I do n't want
MARGOT: Hey ! The man and woman turn around sharply .
WOMAN: What ?
MARGOT: Be careful the way you pull on that child 's arm . You 'll take it out of its socket .
MAN: Do n't tell us how to treat ou child .
MARGOT: I do n't care how you treat you child as long as you do n't hurt him .
PAULINE: It 's a girl .
WOMAN: She threw a rock at me .
MARGOT: She 's a little girl !
WOMAN: She knew what she was doing . She starts suddenly toward Margot .
INGRID: That was the Voglers .
PAULINE: Jesus , Margot , what are you doing . They already hate us .
MARGOT: Do n't tell me what I can and ca n't do . That 's child abuse .
CLAUDE: Mom , she was psychotic .
MARGOT: Stop picking on me . Everyone .
PAULINE: It could be anyone 's .
INGRID: What are they going to do to us ?
PAULINE: They 're not going to do anything , honey .
MALCOLM: Where are we going to get married then ?
PAULINE: I don'twe 'll do it in the fucking drive-way if we have to .
INGRID: Your mom started a war . We have to make sure we wear shoes because they might start throwing glass .
CLAUDE: Has that happened before ?
INGRID: I ca n't remember . I think so . No , it definitely has . Now I remember .
PAULINE: Where are you going ?
MARGOT: To town . I 'll be back for dinner .
PAULINE: Come on , nobody blames you , Margot .
CLAUDE: Is that Dick Koosman ?
PAULINE: Yeah . He has a house up here .
CLAUDE: What 's he doing with mom ?
PAULINE: Good question .
INGRID: How much do your parents make in a year ?
CLAUDE: I think about a hundred . They bank at Chase .
INGRID: Are they rich ?
CLAUDE: No . They 're middle class .
BOY: Just let me live !
INGRID: Upper or lower ?
CLAUDE: I think just middle .
MARGOT: Dick and his daughter asked us ove to swim tomorrow .
PAULINE: We did n't invite them to the wedding .
MARGOT: You 're not really friends .
PAULINE: We 're friends enough that 's it 's awkward . Maisy baby-sits for us all the time .
MARGOT: He 's doing the interview with me in town on Friday . Did I tell you , he and I are collaborating on a screenplay , an adaptation of one of Dick 's novels .
PAULINE: No , I did n't even know you knew he was up here .
MALCOLM: Is he even a good writer ? Why do people care about him ?
PAULINE: You 're competitive with everyone . It does n't matter if they even do the same thing as you . He 's competitive with Bono .
MALCOLM: It 's true . I do n't subscribe to the credo that there 's enough room for everyone to be successful . I think there are only a few spots available and people like Dick Koosman and Bono are taking them up .
PAULINE: Malcolm , what would ever make you think that 's something to draw ight now ?
MALCOLM: Sorry , I was n't thinking about it . Sorry , Margot .
DICK: You found it !
PAULINE: What 's up ?
MALCOLM: I do n't want to do this
PAULINE: Come on , do n't be that way .
MALCOLM: I 'm not being that way I just do n't feel like it . I 'm going to go back and I have work to do .
PAULINE: Dick does n't care that you do n't make any money .
MALCOLM: Is that why you think That 's not why I'mI just hate swimming . I really hate it . It 's disgusting to me . My mistake was saying I 'd do it to begin with . You have fun .
PAULINE: Fine , we 'll have fun .
MALCOLM: People always pee in the pool .
PAULINE: I do n't think Dick and Maisy pee in their pool .
MALCOLM: I 'll bet you 500 dollars there 's pee in that pool .
PAULINE: To the end and back . Claude , you say Go .
CLAUDE: Okay .
DICK: How 's your dad ?
CLAUDE: Good .
DICK: He and I shared a thesis advisor at Stanford . Did you know that ?
CLAUDE: No .
DICK: I was dating your mom back then , did you know that ?
CLAUDE: No .
MARGOT: I did so . It does n't matter . I lost anyway .
PAULINE: It was close . Pauline floats on her back , exhausted .
MARGOT: I got him .
CLAUDE: I 'm sorry I laughed about the tree .
MARGOT: Now we 're even .
PAULINE: Here you are .
MARGOT: You 've got a problem .
PAULINE: What do you mean ?
MARGOT: I do n't like the girl and I do n't like the way Malcolm looks at her .
PAULINE: Oh , come on , it 's sexy .
MARGOT: You did n't see it . I saw it . You 've got a problem .
PAULINE: I 'm not worried . We could teach Claude how to swim .
MARGOT: He wo n't want to do it . It 's too late .
PAULINE: No . She hands it back .
MARGOT: It was n't really about mom .
PAULINE: I thought it was . Anyway . Why do n't you want Claude to know how to swim ?
MARGOT: I did n't say I did n't want him to . Why do you care ? It 's not in his life we 're New Yorkers . If he wants to learn when he 's older , he can . I 'm curious why you 're so interested in the whole thing .
PAULINE: I 'm not . I 'm just As a safety thing andI 'm Forget it .
MARGOT: But are you really friends ?
PAULINE: Kind of . We 're neighbors . We employ Maisy . I mean I do n't care , I just think it 's interesting . Are you excited about the talk ? I thought I 'd come if that 's okay . My friend , Agnes , asked me , `` What 's it like to have a celebrity as a sister ? '' I said , I 've got no problem with celebrity . Alice Munro taught at Bennington and was kind of a friend of mine .
MARGOT: I 'm not a celebrity .
PAULINE: Well , you 're well known .
MARGOT: To a very few people .
PAULINE: Just accept the compliment .
MARGOT: I guess I did n't realize it was a compliment .
MAISY: Singing ? Fumbling , Claude shuts off the tape recorder .
CLAUDE: Hm ? A bit .
MAISY: Can I make a suggestion ?
CLAUDE: Uh huh .
MAISY: You should get underarm deodorant .
CLAUDE: Uh huh .
MAISY: You kind of smell . Claude blushes .
MARGOT: I think you smell nice . You smell eal .
CLAUDE: I stink .
MARGOT: It causes cancer .
CLAUDE: Underarm deodorant ?
MARGOT: Yes . It 's got chemicals and things that are extremely harmful .
CLAUDE: I 'm not going to die from underarm cancer .
MARGOT: No , you 'll get it somewhere else . Like your stomach or you testicles .
CLAUDE: Testicles .
MARGOT: Do n't laugh , that 's a serious thing . Who told you this , anyway ? Maisy ?
CLAUDE: Yeah .
MARGOT: I hope you 're not interested in that girl . I find he insufferable .
CLAUDE: What does that mean ?
MARGOT: It means I ca n't suffer her . She 's loud and stupid . She goes on about things of which she knows nothing about .
CLAUDE: She got into Harvard early .
MARGOT: Stupid people get into Harvard early all the time .
CLAUDE: Where did you go again ?
MARGOT: Barnard . I just do n't think you should do anything with her .
CLAUDE: We 're just friends .
MARGOT: If you do , use a condom .
CLAUDE: Where are you going ?
MARGOT: Out with Paul and Malcolm and Dick .
CLAUDE: Are kids coming ?
INGRID: Who do we know who 's gay ?
MAISY: How do I know what gay people you know .
CLAUDE: Alan and Toby .
INGRID: And Bruce . He 's gay and Aspergers .
CLAUDE: I do n't know if Bruce is gay .
INGRID: He might be , it 's very common .
CLAUDE: Your mom is pregnant .
INGRID: No she is n't .
CLAUDE: She is . Ingrid looks stricken .
MAISY: How do you know that , Claude ?
CLAUDE: She told my mom . But you can tell - - she 's hormonally weird .
MAISY: Holy shit , Ingrid you 're going to have a baby sister or brother .
INGRID: My mom thinks your mom is unreliable .
CLAUDE: Who cares .
MAISY: Do you think your mom is fuckable ?
CLAUDE: I do n't know .
MAISY: I think she 's hot , your mother . I 'd do her if I was gay . I might anyway . I mean if she came on to me .
CLAUDE: She wo n't .
INGRID: I 'm not going to do anyone .
CLAUDE: What was that ?
INGRID: Is it scary ?
PAULINE: Margot used to never speak . I emember when we went on a double date in high school , that kid Ron asked you if English was your first language .
MARGOT: It 's true . I used to think I might have some kind of brain defect .
PAULINE: You thought you were aphasic .
MARGOT: I 'm still not sure .
PAULINE: Oh , Jesus , Margot .
MARGOT: It 's very possible , Paul .
PAULINE: I justyour diagnoses sometimes irk the hell out of me .
MARGOT: Malcolm , can you slow down .
MALCOLM: What ?
DICK: I can drive if you like .
MALCOLM: No , you got dinner , the driving 's on me .
DICK: Well , I 'll let you pay your half if you 'll slow down .
MALCOLM: Well , neither Pauline or I ordered dessert .
PAULINE: Malcolm , let it go . Margot would insist on driving if she knew how .
MARGOT: My license elapsed . But I know how .
MALCOLM: It 's probably for the best . I have this theory , I think , historically , women have been held back in so many ways that when they get power , like they do behind the wheel , they ca n't help but abuse it . It 's akin to Hannah Arendt 's Eichmann theory about prison guards and prisoners switching rolls .
DICK: That 's a charming philosophy .
MARGOT: Yeah . Tell that one a lot .
MALCOLM: This is n't a blanket thing . I mean , women can be great drivers too
PAULINE: Said the man with the moustache that he thinks he 's wearing in quotes .
MARGOT: It 's meant to be funny .
MALCOLM: Are you doing this for her benefit or mine ? Malcolm pumps the brake .
PAULINE: What ?
MALCOLM: No , there they go . Okay . It 's fine . I thought I had no brakes for a minute
MARGOT: Malcolm !
MALCOLM: What ? ! The car swerves again everyone jumps .
MARGOT: Watch it !
MALCOLM: It 's fine , Margot !
PAULINE: You 're just so incompetent .
MALCOLM: Why do n't you fucking drive yourselves home !
PAULINE: Oh , God .
MARGOT: You should go after her .
DICK: Come back with me tonight .
MARGOT: I 've got Claude .
DICK: Come on , I 've been trying to get you up here all year .
MARGOT: She 's pregnant .
INGRID: Why are you putting that there ?
CLAUDE: I just want to keep it .
INGRID: I left a piece of skin in a movie theater once so it could watch movies all its life .
CLAUDE: I do n't know if it 's the same thing .
INGRID: Are you obsessed with Maisy ?
CLAUDE: No .
INGRID: You 're always staring at her tits .
CLAUDE: My mom bleaches it .
INGRID: I 'm going to kiss your cheek and then you kiss mine .
CLAUDE: I do n't want to do that .
INGRID: Why not ?
CLAUDE: Because it 's pointless
INGRID: Where are you going ? I thought we were having a conversation .
CLAUDE: You 're starting to annoy me .
MARGOT: Where would I be ?
CLAUDE: Ca n't Josh and Dad come to the wedding ?
MARGOT: We 've been through this . Go to ed .
CLAUDE: Can I sleep in here ?
MARGOT: No , honey .
CLAUDE: We can put a pillow between us .
MARGOT: Okay . Just for tonight .
INGRID: Why was it a secret ?
PAULINE: Because I did n't want to get you excited before it was real . It 's not really a baby yet . In two more weeks we can celebrate together , okay ?
INGRID: Why did you tell Margot ?
PAULINE: Because she 's my sister and I trust her . How do you feel about it ?
INGRID: I do n't want a sister . Pauline touches Ingrid 's hair gently .
PAULINE: Margot told Claude something I expressly told her in confidence . And he told Ingrid .
MALCOLM: Well it 's that thing where
PAULINE: Do n't say anything . You know whatjust be there for me . Silently .
MALCOLM: Okay .
PAULINE: Why do I have to be so careful around her , but everyone is allowed to make fun of me ?
MALCOLM: I do n't know if
PAULINE: Malcolm , what did I just say ? You know , I just want you to take my side , I do n't need you to make it better .
MALCOLM: Uh huh .
PAULINE: Welldoes that sound good to you ?
MALCOLM: I 'm still digesting Margot telling Claude . What a fucking nut job . Sorry . I think I 'm really happy .
PAULINE: Come here , honey !
MARGOT: Hey . I 'm just looking at Pauline 's incense and self-help books . I do n't understand it . This junk makes her look stupid and she 's not . I do n't like to think of he this way .
CLAUDE: Uh huh .
MARGOT: She 's such a hypocrite . Somehow I 'm a kook for going to therapy , ut she 's got enough drugs here to medicate a an elephant . And she 's always with these losers .
CLAUDE: Malcolm 's not a loser .
MARGOT: Claudethink about it .
CLAUDE: He 's cool .
MARGOT: What makes you think he 's cool ? I 'm more talking about he investment in things like the Forum and ashrams .
CLAUDE: What 's the Forum ?
MARGOT: Like a cult .
CLAUDE: She was in a cult ?
MARGOT: Years ago . She and Lenny also followed some guru who was a follower of the Mukdananda who made her drink his bath water . Who knows what she 's doing now .
CLAUDE: Wizard !
MARGOT: Wizard ! Here , boy !
PAULINE: I do n't know . Ingrid brought him in last night , but we could n't find him this morning .
MARGOT: Oh boy .
PAULINE: Did you tell Claude I 'm pregnant ?
MARGOT: I do n't know .
PAULINE: You did .
MARGOT: I guess I said something .
PAULINE: You did . You do n't have to tell him everything .
MARGOT: He wants to know . If I do n't tell him , he figures it out .
PAULINE: I do n't know , honey .
CLAUDE: You did n't let him go out into the oad or something where something could 've happened to him ?
MARGOT: Why would you think I 'd do something like that ? That 's awful .
CLAUDE: I just I 'm just making sure .
MARGOT: That 's a terrible thing to say to me .
CLAUDE: I did n't mean on purpose , I just meant maybe in caseyou knew something . I 'm sorry .
MARGOT: Woa !
MALCOLM: Hey , sorry . I 'm here .
MARGOT: No , I I should 've looked .
MALCOLM: I 'm just writing my vows . Trying to do something appropriate but also funny not jokey , more character based humor .
MARGOT: Oh , yeah . Besides Wizard getting
MALCOLM: Yeah , we'llwe 'll find himo else , I do n't know
MARGOT: We wo n't .
MALCOLM: Right , or else he 's dead o something . It means a lot to Paul that you came .
MARGOT: Yeah . Silence . Malcolm mumbles a tune .
MALCOLM: I hear you 've heard the news .
MARGOT: Yeah . Congratulations .
MALCOLM: Pretty cool . Hard to fully take in . It 's a little abstract still . I have n't had that thing yet where you realize that you 're not the most important person in the world . I 'm anxious for that to happen . I guess I have to thank you I would n't know yet if you had n't arrived .
MARGOT: You 're welcome .
MALCOLM: Of course I ca n't help but worry I 'll pass some not so great genes onto the kid . I mean , in my family there 's a lot of hand washing , you know . I do n't have it , but my other does . You working on anything now ?
MARGOT: Besides the thing with Dick ?
MALCOLM: Oh , right . He nods . She nods . Silence .
MARGOT: How about you ?
MALCOLM: Oh , I 'm working on some acrylic paint
MARGOT: Nobody fills the ice cube trays .
MALCOLM: Nothing . It does n't matter .
MARGOT: No , what were you saying ?
MALCOLM: It really Nothing .
MARGOT: Okay .
MALCOLM: I was saying I 'm doing these abstractions in acrylic paint . But it 's not I 'm not getting paid or anything . I do n't know , I hate that question , `` What do you do ? ''
MARGOT: You asked me .
MALCOLM: I know , but
PAULINE: And that they can come for a glass of champagne . But you tell them . I think they respond to you better .
MALCOLM: Well , I am ultimately one of them . You shouldn't 've made me shave the stache .
PAULINE: Yeah , right .
MALCOLM: Oh , hey , Ingrid is asking me if I was ever gay . Do you know what that 's about ?
PAULINE: No .
VOGLER: You gon na cut that tree down ?
PAULINE: Well , we grew up with that tree and we 're getting married under it Saturday and
VOGLER: The roots are growing into ou property . It 's rotting , it 's killing our plants .
PAULINE: We had a tree doctor out and he said it was healthy . Pauline smacks Malcolm 's arm .
MALCOLM: What ? What do you want from me ?
PAULINE: You 're making me do the whole fucking thing .
MALCOLM: You brought up the tree .
PAULINE: He brought up She stops herself . She says to Vogler
VOGLER: You should ask her . She makes the plans . I 'm going to go in now . He tramps inside . The screen door bangs .
MALCOLM: I felt like you did n't give me a chance to say what I wanted to say .
PAULINE: You 've never hit anyone .
MALCOLM: I have too !
PAULINE: Who ?
MALCOLM: Lots of You do n't know them . They 're not around because I 've punched them .
PAULINE: She 's not an idiot . You might not like her
MALCOLM: She is . She is an idiot ! You 're an idiot .
PAULINE: Jesus .
MALCOLM: You 're both fucking morons . I 'm so fucking I 'm trying so hard . You do n't give me any credit .
PAULINE: What is wrong ?
MALCOLM: I do n't know , I have the emotional version of whatever bad feng shui would be . I do n't know . You tell me , you understand this shit .
PAULINE: Did you drink your teas ?
MALCOLM: Yeah , I drank my fucking teas ! Do n't judge me now . Really , I think when you look back at this you 're going to see I 'm not acting like a crazy person . That this is the right reaction . In proportion with what is going on . This is ight !
PAULINE: You have the most oddly self- conscious form of rage I 've ever
MALCOLM: I hate you .
PAULINE: Jim
JIM: It was a difficult decision because Claude has so many friends at school now , but it is expensive and Bronx Science is a great public school .
CLAUDE: I did n't get into Stuyvesant .
MARGOT: He 's not a good test taker .
MALCOLM: I went to Stuy .
MARGOT: Really ?
MALCOLM: Really .
CLAUDE: I 'd rather stay at Packer , but it 's so expensive .
JIM: Josh is a great test taker , but Claude thinks more abstractly . He 's more creative . Right ?
CLAUDE: I guess so . Jim smiles warmly at his son .
JIM: I saw the one armed man who really has two arms at the bodega .
CLAUDE: Did you give him confusing change ?
JIM: I did . I tripped him up with some nickels . And a Canadian quarter .
MALCOLM: You know what I tried the othe day ? Sitting down to pee . Have you done this , Jim ?
JIM: Nono .
MALCOLM: I did it as a lark . As a joke eally . I was going to call Pauline in and say , guess what I 'm doing here
PAULINE: I 'm sorry I did n't get to have that experience .
MALCOLM: I was thinking , you know , my dad used to say , `` Why stand when you can sit . '' And this is a really good example of that . I mean , it took me so long to try because I was embarrassed . You guys do it all the time .
MARGOT: I never sit down in a public place . I squat and hover .
MALCOLM: Anyway , I recommend it . At least to try it .
PAULINE: Jim , I 'm sorry about the room . It 's usually Malcolm 's storage room so it 's kind of make-shift right now .
JIM: It 's fine . Margot stares at Jim .
MARGOT: I get self-conscious opening presents in front of people . This weekend is about Pauline .
PAULINE: Ohpoo . Open it Margot .
MALCOLM: Those look warm .
JIM: I remember last year in Vermont you said your feet were freezing .
MARGOT: Thank you .
JIM: Well , that 's okay . Two sets are fine , right ?
MARGOT: It makes me sad to get a present that I already have .
JIM: Why ?
MARGOT: It makes me feel like you do n't know me .
JIM: What 's wrong with your ear ?
MARGOT: I asked you not to come . I was so clear and you did it anyway so lithely .
JIM: We need time alone to sort this out . You ca n't just run away
MARGOT: Okay , so we 're here . I 'm giving you this time .
JIM: Well , now you 're putting too much pressure on me .
MARGOT: Keep driving . Jim slowly pulls over to the shoulder .
JIM: Let me just
WOMAN: Please help me . Jim comes toward her .
MARGOT: Jim
WOMAN: Help me !
MARGOT: Careful , he might bite you ! Jim suddenly lifts up the twitching animal .
WOMAN: Hurryhe 's dying . He 's dying .
MARGOT: Oh , God .
JIM: Margot .
MARGOT: I ca n't stand her .
JIM: She did n't have her purse with her . It was n't so expensive . Roger 's going to live .
MARGOT: I do n't give a fuck about Roger . Andthat makes me feel like shit . You make me feel like shit . I would n't have stopped .
JIM: Of course you would 've .
MARGOT: No , I wouldn't 've . I would have kept driving . I hate myself when I 'm with you .
JIM: Margot , I 'm not I ca n't talk to you when you 're this fucked up .
MARGOT: You 're just like Claude in that wayyou make me feel guilty . Sometimes I find you so despicable .
JIM: What 's wrong ?
MARGOT: I do n't know . Before you gave me your sweater I think I did n't realize I was cold .
PAULINE: I know . We 're at the age where we 're becoming invisible to men and if a guy wants to fuck us , it 's very tempting .
MARGOT: What are you saying ?
PAULINE: I 'm saying , if you get your sense of self from being fuckable and that starts to wane it 's very hard . I almost had an affair too . But you know , you do n't have to do it . You can , I do n't know , get a manicure or something .
MARGOT: Me too .
PAULINE: But I ca n't help feeling that you eally came to my wedding because I live a mile away from the guy you 're fucking .
MARGOT: Come on , Pauline . You make it sound like I 'm using you .
PAULINE: Yeah .
MARGOT: Did I get it ?
PAULINE: Yeah , I think so .
MARGOT: Paul , what are you doing getting married to this guy ? He 's not good enough for you . He 's so coarse , he 's like guys we rejected when we were sixteen . You knowdo n't make a mistake like this . I 'm sorry , maybe I have no right to say that , but you know I 'm truthful so Would you rather I lie ?
PAULINE: Who should I be with then ?
MARGOT: Creeps .
CLAUDE: Dogs usually come back , I think .
INGRID: What happened to your dad ?
CLAUDE: He went to Vermont .
INGRID: He did n't want to come to the wedding ?
CLAUDE: I do n't think he could I think he could n't . You want to see me dance ?
INGRID: Okay .
CLAUDE: You 're not watching .
BOY: Where are you going ?
CLAUDE: We have to get home .
BOY: Is that your girlfriend ?
CLAUDE: No , she 's my cousin .
BOY: You a fruity ?
CLAUDE: Umno .
BOY: You a fruity ?
INGRID: No .
BOY: We will hurt you .
INGRID: He 's a Vogler .
CLAUDE: He 's just a stupid boy .
INGRID: Hold it , I have a rock in my sandal .
CLAUDE: Come on , Ingrid .
INGRID: Oww !
CLAUDE: Get him off me . Ingrid ! Ingrid hesitates then runs toward the house .
MARGOT: Woa , do n't run so fast .
CLAUDE: There 's a boy ! He bit me !
MARGOT: Who bit you ?
CLAUDE: A boy . A Vogler ! Where 's Ingrid ?
MARGOT: Let me see .
CLAUDE: No , do n't ! It 'll get worse . Why did you say anything to them ?
MARGOT: Claude , this is n't my fault .
CLAUDE: That boy bit me because you could n't keep your fat mouth shut .
MARGOT: Claude , you 're being a jerk .
CLAUDE: You shit in your shoes and then you fuck them !
PAULINE: You really want to know ? I 'll tell you . She wrote a story about Lenny and me . Yeah , it 's in here . I mean we were talking almost every day at this point and there was no warning . Maybe a couple of remarks that she 'd used some things of ours Then The New Yorker comes we have a subscription and there 's the story and It 's things we said and did stuff I told her in confidence .
CLAUDE: She does n't hate you .
PAULINE: You think ? Margot tried to murde me when we were girls . She put me on a baking sheet , sprinkled me with paprika and put me in the oven .
MARGOT: Jim was here . Dick flips through some notes .
DICK: Is Jim still writing ?
MARGOT: I told him to go to Vermont without me .
DICK: I 'd love to see him tell a linea story for a change . Jim neve wanted to make it easy for the eader , did he . The nicest man I 've ever met , but he ca n't play the game .
MARGOT: I 'm not joining him . I 'm going to stay here and thenwe 'll see . Right . Okay ?
DICK: I did n't ask you to do that . The guy 's pointing at us
MARGOT: Yeah , well I was very interested in exploring a father-daughte elationship . While he clings desperately to her , suffocates he eally , he also silently resents the responsibility of parenthood .
DICK: There 's this sexualized push-pull with Daphne which I find
MARGOT: He craves isolation really . I always thought of him as someone who so over identifies with everyone around him that he begins to lose all sense of himself .
DICK: You make his only recourse to abandon his family , including his eloved daughter .
MARGOT: Right , that 's true . That 's true .
DICK: I write historical fiction so I do n't have to answer to this , but I wonder for someone who writes so nakedly about family , how autobiographical is this portrait ?
MARGOT: My father was a loving person . He had his days , of course , buthe was devoted to us as children . I would n't have written this portrait were it true . Pauline nods slightly .
DICK: But I 'm interested in how the father could be in fact a portrait of you . Margot stares , dumbstruck .
MARGOT: UmmI do n't Why do you assume it 's based on We all take from life . I had to have ou efrigerator repaired the other day at our apartment in Manhattan . I was alone with a guy , I think he was Puerto Rican , sent ove yWhirlpool , I think it is who made our fridge . Although he said he worked for an independent organization who Whirlpool subcontracts . I think he was etarded . There was an anger in him and suddenly I became afraid for my life . I called Jim at NYU . I asked him to come home . Margot stops . Her face is awash in sweat .
CLAUDE: What 's wrong ?
MARGOT: I do n't know . I 'll tell you sometime . Go on .
CLAUDE: Are you sure ?
MARGOT: Yes . Go with mom . I 'll see you later .
CLAUDE: You said , mom .
MARGOT: But you know what I mean . Go with Pauline . Jesus , do Ido I need to spell it out for you ? Go . With . Her .
PAULINE: Are you okay ?
CLAUDE: I 'm okay .
PAULINE: You 're your mom 's favorite . Do you know that ?
CLAUDE: I do n't think she has a favorite .
PAULINE: She 's always liked you best . More than Jim even .
CLAUDE: But they 're married . It 's different .
PAULINE: But she still loves you best . It 's hard , I think , to find people in the world you love more than you family .
CLAUDE: I like Malcolm .
PAULINE: Yeah ? Good . I do n't know . I do too . I can teach you to swim if you like .
CLAUDE: No , thanks .
PAULINE: Has your mother talked to you yet ?
CLAUDE: I do n't think so . About what ?
PAULINE: Are you okay ? It 's hard to see your mom like that get attacked like that . Right ? It was mean what he did . I think it was really shitty .
CLAUDE: Mm hm .
PAULINE: You know , I think your mom 's going through a rough time right now andwhatever she tells youlike if she says she 's leaving you fatherremember that she often changes her mind and
INGRID: He 's cutting it down .
PAULINE: Good . Pauline passes Maisy reading on the patio .
MAISY: My dad 's late to pick me up . I hope I 'm not a pain .
PAULINE: You 're not a pain .
MARGOT: I told Paul I did n't want you guys to come .
CLAUDE: I thought it was interesting .
MARGOT: What did Paul say ?
CLAUDE: I think she liked it .
MARGOT: Yeah , right . Did you talk about me afterwards ?
CLAUDE: No .
MARGOT: I can tell you 're lying .
CLAUDE: We did n't , mom .
MARGOT: I do n't trust her .
CLAUDE: She really loves you . She does .
MARGOT: Pauline told me she 's very disappointed in you .
CLAUDE: Why ?
MARGOT: She thinks you laze about the house . Ingrid is always offering to help clean or cook . She made acelets for all the guests . Even Malcolm puts up the tent . You just wait until everyone else does it for you .
CLAUDE: That 's not true .
MARGOT: It is true . You 're never helpful . I wish I had taught you bette manners .
CLAUDE: I can try to make popovers . If I can remember how .
MARGOT: Do n't bother . She looks at him with grave disappointment .
CLAUDE: Why are you looking at me like that ?
MARGOT: I just see how much you 've changed . Your body language . You used to be ounder and more graceful . You 're so stiff now . So blase .
CLAUDE: What do you mean ?
MARGOT: I ca n't explain it .
CLAUDE: Uh huh .
MARGOT: You 're still handsome .
PAULINE: Are you able to do this yourself ?
MALCOLM: Pauline , do you want me to cut it down or not ?
PAULINE: Watch the tent .
MALCOLM: I liked how it looked on Vogler .
PAULINE: I think it 's over between Dick and Margot . He was so cruel to he today . And poor Claude had to watch it all . She should just get out of the marriage and then she can fuck whoever she wants , you know . It 's cowardly . And Dick Koosman . What a choice . I meanyou know ?
MALCOLM: I agree . I hate the idea of Dick fucking Margot .
PAULINE: What does that mean ? You want to fuck Margot ?
MALCOLM: Pauline , that 's not what I said .
PAULINE: I know you have a crush on her , you already told me that .
MALCOLM: I did n't say that . I said I thought she was attractive afte you grilled me . She has no interest in me anyway . Not that it would matter if she did .
PAULINE: Have you ever done anything like that .
MALCOLM: What do you mean ?
PAULINE: Have you ever cheated on me ?
MALCOLM: No ! Malcolm shuts the motor .
PAULINE: Those emails you had with that student of mine .
MALCOLM: Uh huh .
PAULINE: Did thatI know you said it was nothing .
MALCOLM: It was .
PAULINE: I just Can you say it again ?
MALCOLM: I just did . Now , can I cut down the tree ?
PAULINE: You never did anything with her ?
MALCOLM: No . She emailed me after we met at that reading at the college and You know we were friends .
PAULINE: Right , just a regular friendship etween you and a twenty year old girl .
MALCOLM: Pauline , how many times do I have to say it .
PAULINE: Butwhy do n't I believe it ?
MALCOLM: Because Margot ca n't understand why you 're with me and now when she 's around you look for things .
PAULINE: You promise .
MALCOLM: I promise .
PAULINE: Okay . I 'm sorry .
MALCOLM: It 's okay .
PAULINE: What ?
MALCOLM: I do n't want to lose you , though . Okay ? Pauline 's face goes pale .
PAULINE: I do n't want to know .
MALCOLM: we did n't really do anything . We were goofing around , I was making fun of her cause she dates a jock
PAULINE: I do n't want to know .
MALCOLM: I shouldn't 've put myself in that position , I know that . We brushed lips really . It was barely a kiss . And then we stopped . That was it .
INGRID: Has anyone seen Wizard ?
PAULINE: No . Where 's Maisy ?
INGRID: Upstairs , I think with Claude .
MAISY: Oh , hi . Sorry , I had to go . I hope that 's okay I used yours .
PAULINE: Nothing .
MAISY: Claude , do you want to play croquet ?
CLAUDE: Okay .
INGRID: There 's Dick .
MALCOLM: Almost .
DICK: Fucking sleazebag ! Dick gets up . He kicks Malcolm hard .
MALCOLM: Fuck off , dickhead .
MARGOT: Come with me to New York .
PAULINE: I ca n't talk about it
MARGOT: Okay , but you ca n't marry him . You have to go now . We can think about what to do with the baby
PAULINE: Margot , I ca n't
MARGOT: Do n't turn vague , listen to me
PAULINE: I want you to pack all your things and get out of here . You can take our car and leave it at the ferry .
MARGOT: What ?
CLAUDE: I 'll help out more . I can make popovers .
PAULINE: Do you love me ? Good .
MARGOT: Do n't take this out on me ? I 'm on your side .
PAULINE: No , you 're not . You 're not .
MARGOT: I 've kept my mouth shut because
PAULINE: No , you have n't kept your mouth shut ! No you haven'tkept you mouth shut
MARGOT: Okay , I told you and I was right . He 's done an insane thing . You do n't know this man . What he did is criminal .
PAULINE: Margot , I ca n't
MARGOT: It 's pedophilia .
PAULINE: Get out !
MARGOT: What ? What are you saying ? I do n't recognize you it 's like you 're channelling someone .
PAULINE: Ingrid !
INGRID: What ? Pauline 's breaths are rapid , jagged . Ingrid stands . A wind whips up . The tree sways .
PAULINE: I 'm sorry .
INGRID: Wizard !
CLAUDE: I thought you could n't drive .
MARGOT: I can drive . Why does everyone say that ? I used to drive .
PAULINE: We have to call people and cancel .
INGRID: What happened ? Can I still sing ? Margot rolls down the window .
MARGOT: You do smell .
CLAUDE: Well , I 'm not wearing any deodorant .
MARGOT: Shit .
CLAUDE: What ?
MARGOT: I do n't think No We do n't have brakes .
PAULINE: The brakes are bad , that 's right .
CLAUDE: What does that mean ?
MARGOT: What do you think it means ?
CLAUDE: I mean , what can we do ? The car coasts faster down the hill .
MARGOT: I ruined these shoes .
INGRID: Mom , are you okay ?
PAULINE: Fuck .
CLAUDE: Did she poop in her pants ?
MARGOT: It happens to everyone . Not just abies . It 'll happen to you too someday .
PAULINE: I left mom and Becky a message .
MARGOT: I do n't think mom knows how to work the machine . Margot puts her pinky in her ear .
PAULINE: You should take care of that . It can hatch eggs .
MARGOT: Sweety , there 's a bus that leaves to Vermont from town tomorrow morning . I just talked to your dad and he 's going to pick you up .
CLAUDE: Are n't you coming ?
MARGOT: No .
CLAUDE: Why not ?
MARGOT: I have to help out Paul and Ingrid . Claude tugs gently on his yellow bracelet .
CLAUDE: I do n't want to go tomorrow .
PAULINE: There 's Malcolm .
MARGOT: You 're going to be fine .
PAULINE: Maybemaybe I could get a place in Brooklyn Williamsburg o something . People are living there ight ?
MARGOT: You do n't want to live there . It 's all young people .
PAULINE: But what do you think of that idea ?
MARGOT: Maybe . Let 's see . You know if you do n't want to come with me , I 'm sure mom will let you stay with he
PAULINE: You 're already trying to pass me off on mom
MARGOT: Do n't say that . Come on , you 'll come home with us .
PAULINE: You do n't even know where you 're going to live . You might have to move in with mom too . Margot tightens .
CLAUDE: What ?
MARGOT: Nothing . Just then I felt so much love for you .
PAULINE: You can not write about this . You ca n't have it .
MARGOT: I was n't writing about you .

BARTENDER: Why ?
MARIACHI: I 'm a mariachi . A good one . I play eautiful ballads , old classic ballads , on an old-fashioned guitar .
BARTENDER: So what ?
MARIACHI: I could add a little class to this place . I work for fairly cheap , I live mostly off tips . But I need steady work , and I can guarantee bringing in more customers .
BARTENDER: Tell me , why would I need one little guitar player when I 've already got a full band ? Mariachi gives him a silent `` what '' look .

VIEJO CLERK: Oh , that 's enough for now , sir , thank you and enjoy your stay .
VIEJO CLERK: 127 ! ! ! Cuarto 127 , pendejos ! ! !

MARIACHI: Cuidado , viejo !
VIEJO CLERK: Pendejos ! ! !
DOMINO: What happened to you , Mariachi ? Too much efresco ?
MARIACHI: I just killed four guys .
DOMINO: Is it true ? Mariachi nods an ashamed yes .
MARIACHI: Wait a minute what 's your name ?
DOMINO: Domino .
MARIACHI: Wait a minute , Domino ! It was self- defense . She cocks the pistol .
DOMINO: Thieves ?
MARIACHI: No way . They were well-dressed men . I checked into the cheapest hotel in town , no money , nothing of value , except this guitar and maybe this coat , which they could have taken when I left my room , but they did n't . They were only interested in killing me .
DOMINO: So why do you come here ? You want to get me killed ?
MARIACHI: I need a place to stay until I figure this out . They 've got me mixed up with someone else .
DOMINO: And you 've never seen them before ? Not even in another town ?
MARIACHI: Are you saying they followed me , a mariachi , here ? What for ?
DOMINO: Maybe they hate your music .
MARIACHI: Are you serious ?
DOMINO: Yes . She laughes .
MARIACHI: Are you going to help me , or am I gon na have to die on your porch ?
DOMINO: I have a room upstairs . My room . Do n't touch anything . I 'll be up after awhile and we can call a friend of mine . Mariachi shakes her hand .

MARIACHI: Sorry . I needed to relax . I can

DOMINO: You wo n't find a permanent job in this town but OK .
GIRL #1: Yes ? One moment please
AZUL: Yeah .
MOCO: Amigo ! I 'm glad I 've reached you ! You 've not answered all day . Killing ten of my men must have been very time consuming !
AZUL: Six .
MOCO: What ?
AZUL: I 've only killed six ! You were always bad at math , Moco . I guess that 's why you never paid me half of the money . You thought it all belonged to you .
MOCO: I knew half was yours I got greedy , my friend . It 's my nature . But you ! ! ! You are modest ! You 've killed ten of my men ! ! I know , because I 'm having them buried in my yard right now . With my dogs and cats .
AZUL: I killed six . But do n't bother counting so soon . The number will triple by tomorrow .
MOCO: I 'm sorry things turned out this way . My friend . I got greedy . I should never have tried to kill you . It would have been cheaper for me to pay you . Now I 've got to find ten new men .
AZUL: Six .
MOCO: Ten .
AZUL: I tell you what . You give me my money , and I wo n't kill any more of your men And I wo n't kill you .
MOCO: No , it 's too late for that . We 're going to have to see this through .
AZUL: Just like the Moco I used to know . Still wearing white ?
MOCO: What do you think ?
AZUL: I think you should change clothes . I 'd hate to ruin a white suit with you stupid blood .
MARIACHI: I need to get my money back from that hotel . I 'll be right back .
DOMINO: Are you crazy ? If you go anywhere with that jacket and that case you could be killed . Leave that stuff here .
MARIACHI: I never go anywhere without it . Take care of it .

AZUL: Thank you .
MARIACHI: I just saw a guy with a guitar case like mine . It 's him they want .
DOMINO: Did he say anything ?
ASSISTANT: No , he just ordered a drink .
MARIACHI: I do n't look anything like him
AZUL: My guitar .
DOMINO: Look , as long as you do n't carry the case around , they 'll leave you alone . It 's that guy they 're after .
MARIACHI: I better put this upstairs
DOMINO: What 's wrong ?
RAT #1: I 'm sorry we left
RAT #2: We did n't know what to do
RAT #1: We figured you could defend yourself ! ! !
AZUL: You thought I could defend myself
RAT #1: Where is this mariachi ?
AZUL: He 's dead by now So , I want you to go look for my case . The two Rats are about to leave .
RAT #2: Yes .
AZUL: Are you loyal ?
RAT #2: Yes . Azul gestures to Rat # 2 .
AZUL: Then shoot him . Rat # 1 turns to Rat # 2 who is in shock .
RAT #1: I ca n't .
AZUL: Why not ?
RAT #1: You said we should be as loyal to you as we are to each other . I could n't shoot him , for that would be as disloyal as shooting you .
AZUL: Very good . Now go find my case .
MARIACHI: Where were you when he came into the bar ?
DOMINO: I was on the phone , talking to a friend that knows what 's going on .
MARIACHI: Did you mention me ?
DOMINO: No He told me the man in black is Azul .
MARIACHI: If his name is Azul , why does n't he wea lue ?
DOMINO: I do n't know Anyway , he 's killing the men of the town drug dealer . The dealer 's name is Mauricio . But he 's known as Moco .
MARIACHI: And Moco is sending these men to find Azul . So , why do they chase me ?
DOMINO: They have never seen Azul only Moco knows him . My friend says the description Moco gave his men was that he wears lack , and carries a guitar case . Sounds like you , no ?
MARIACHI: Could n't you tell your friend that there are two people like that in his town ? One is a killer , and one is a mariachi .
DOMINO: Only special people can talk to Moco . Besides , you 've killed a few of his men , now . Your best option is to keep out of sight , stop wearing black , and to hide that stupid case until this is all over .
MARIACHI: Are you always closed Monday nights , o did you close since I ca n't play my guitar tonight ?
DOMINO: Mondays are my day off . Want to play a game ?
MARIACHI: Sure .

MARIACHI: I ca n't figure out something . You tell me you 're poor . Poor family . Yet you 've got this place .
DOMINO: This place is a gift .
MARIACHI: From who ?
DOMINO: From Mauricio .
MARIACHI: From Mauricio ? The man trying to kill me ?
DOMINO: He 's not trying to kill you , his man had you confused with Azul .
MARIACHI: Same thing .
DOMINO: Look , you now how if you want to impress a girl , you send her flowers , candy , jewelry until you win her love ?
MARIACHI: Yes .
DOMINO: If one present does n't work , you keep sending bigger and better things until you win her or you 're broke ?
MARIACHI: Correct
DOMINO: Well , Mauricio sent me flowers , then jewelry , then he gave me a job at his saloon , then he gave me the whole saloon etc .
MARIACHI: He 's still giving you things ?
DOMINO: He 'll never run out of money .
MARIACHI: And you accept it all ? What 's the last thing he sent you ?
DOMINO: A motorcycle . Mariachi laughs .
MARIACHI: Is he ?
DOMINO: He was . She sits next to Mariachi .
MARIACHI: So , you really are from a poor family .
DOMINO: I remember when I was growing up , we were so poor , that my brothers and sisters and I all slept on the same blanket stretched out across the floor . We had to sleep in a circle , with our fingers in each other 's ears , to keep the bugs from crawling into them .
MARIACHI: Ay , wey Domino laughs .
DOMINO: Here 's a little bit I 've saved . I want you to go get a new guitar .
LOCO: He got in my truck . Mean Dude # 5 laughs .
MOCO: That 's not him .
AZUL: Where 's my case ?
RAT #1: We could n't find it .
RAT #2: We heard they caught you and were taking you to Moco 's ranch .
RAT #1: so we came to see if it was true . Azul thinks a moment . He stands up .
AZUL: They caught the mariachi . Azul dresses , smiling
DOMINO: What can I get you ?
AZUL: One beer .

AZUL: My guitar case .
DOMINO: Where 's Mariachi ?
AZUL: Where 's my case ?
DOMINO: Upstairs .
AZUL: Get it .
DOMINO: Why will you help me ?
AZUL: Because you know where Moco 's ranch is I do n't . Domino calls her Assistant .
DOMINO: Let 's go . They leave . The Assistant tends to the bar .
AZUL: Play along He kicks at the gate .
MOCO: I 'm sorry he used you to get to me , Domino . Azul cocks the pistol .
AZUL: Moco , give me my money or I ruin you clothes with her blood . Moco signals his men to get the money .
DOMINO: What have you done with Mariachi ?
MOCO: Who ?
DOMINO: The musician your men confused with Azul .
MOCO: So that 's why you were busy that night Azul is glancing between Domino and Moco .
AZUL: Give me my money or I kill her NOW ! ! !
MOCO: After all I 've done for you , this is how you treat me ?
DOMINO: I never asked you for anything until now . Let Mariachi go .
AZUL: I swear I 'll kill her !
MOCO: No you wo n't . I will .
AZUL: All I wanted was my rightful share . But you 've got to kill everybody .
MOCO: You feel sorry for her , do n't you ? See , that 's why you ca n't ever be as big as me . Azul slowly looks at Moco .
MARIACHI: Stop here .

AN: Taken r. Sebastian . up l ^a
JOHN: ( to CAMERA , which is
SEBASTIAN: People are staring at me - is my fly down ?
JOHN: All right , enough with the - - all right , what ? What are you looking at ?
SEBASTIAN: Oh , wait , there 's something on you forehead . John brushes it .
DUBIOUS: A leaf . On my forehead .
SEBASTIAN: Yeah , it musta had some sap on it .
ON TAPE: All right , I 'm zooming in . Whoa . Not a flosser .
JOHN: Turn it off .
SEBASTIAN: They 're okay ! They 're getting out .
JENNY: Are you a complete idiot ? !
JOHN: How do I get vou ?
JENNY: What ?
JOHN: I 'm serious . In what world does a guy like me get someone like you ?
JENNY: Are you kidding ? You 're part of the plan .
JOHN: The plan .
JENNY: Step one . Meet an incredibly sweet , smart , sexy guy .
JOHN: Done . Step two ?
JENNY: Marry him .
JOHN: Check . Step three ? She smiles , puts her face right up to his
JENNY: Now that one 's a surprise
JOHN: Oh yeah .
JENNY: You know you got this .
JOHN: I know , I got it .
JENNY: Who are you ?
JOHN: I 'm John Grogan .
JENNY: Wrong . You 're John Friggin Grogan who 's about to get a job .
JOHN: Um , okay , see now I do n't wan na get out of the car .
JOHN: i really just wan na sit here and make out with you .
JENNY: Get out of the car . He nods , starts to get out , then pauses .
JOHN: Who am i again ?
QUICKLY: Kidding .
JOHN: Yes , sir , I got a Mitchy .
ARNIE: A Mitchy . Min-hmm . So , tell me , why did you want to leave the estimable - ( he flips to a story , reads
THE HEADING: - Kalamazoo Gazette ?
JOHN: Well , as you know , Sebastian and I were in college together , and he was always talking about South Florida mostly about the women of South Florida , but anyway , after my wife and I got married we thought it might be nice to come
ARNIE: For the women ?
JOHN: Uh , no for the the uh
ARNIE: For the work ?
JOHN: Yes . That .
ARNIE: Your wife 's Jenny Havens , right ?

ARNIE: Straight news writer , huh . Meaning you think you 're a reporter ?
JOHN: Meaning I know I am .
ARNIE: And the six other sweaty-palmed college grads I 'm interviewing today , you think you 're better than them ?
JOHN: No , sir . In fact , I 'm pretty sure I 'm not . But I do know that I always seem to surprise myself . Ten years ago , I was doing bong hits and playing Donkey Kong , never dreamed I 'd get into college . But I did , and I graduated with honors . Two years ago , my buddies told me that the most Jenny Havens would ever say to me was , You 're sweet , ut I do n't like you in that way.. But she did like me in that way and my uddies can suck it because I married her . I certainly never thought I 'd win some award with a dumbass name
ARNIE: That 's quite a speech , son . You ehearse that , or come up with it on the fly ?
JOHN: Elevator , on the way up .
THEN: How 'd I do ? Arnie just looks back at him .

JOHN: - '' it would be worth it . And with that , Janet Dickerson 's mother 's eyes filled with tears . ''
THEN: That one just felt exactly right , y'know ?
JENNY: Yeah , no , it 's good . What happened to the Desert Storm piece ?
JOHN: That 's it . The injured girl 's dad 's in Kuwait . What , that 's not in there ?
JENNY: Uhhhh they must 've cut it And they kinda misspelled your name . John Egan
JOHN: What you 're kidding
JENNY: Forget it . It 's good , John . It 's got facts , some color . It 's a solid piece .
JOHN: Thanks . I 'm almost done with yours . This idea of voting machines sounds
JENNY: Well , except on the other page I talk about what could happen He goes back to reading . She sips her coffee .
JOHN: Oh , it continues
JENNY: You know what ? The rest is just okay , eally pretty boring
JOHN: No , no , I 'm enjoying it
JENNY: Damn . I killed another one . How am I ever going to take care of a kid , I ca n't even keep a plant alive ?
SEBASTIAN: Well , what 'd you expect ? You bought a house , man . A house with a mare oom
JOHN: What 's wrong with a spare room ?
SEBASTIAN: It 's empty , John . That 's what 's wrong with it . And you know what else is empty ? Her womb .
JOHN: I 'm starting to worry that we 're already at Step Six .

JOHN: And a dog
SEBASTIAN: Whatever , man . You 're still free . You 've stopped the clock .
JOHN: What clock ?
SEBASTIAN: Okay you know in movies when there 's , like , a bomb and it 's ticking down , ten seconds left , and there 's some guy with a wire cutter going , `` red wire blue wire which one do I cut ? '' And the guy finally just makes a wild-assed guess and SNIP . Silence . The world is saved .
JOHN: Okay is the bomb strapped to a dog because I 'm not sure I 'm
SEBASTIAN: John , you buy this dog , you 're saving your world . Because that ticking you hear , is not a bomb , it 's he iological clock . John looks back at him .
JOHN: Huh .
SEBASTIAN: In motion .
JOHN: Where you going ?
SEBASTIAN: Colombia . I got a guy down there , says he can put me next to Pablo Escobar I 'm doing this piece , I follow a single coca leaf from Colombia , to the streets of Miami .
JOHN: Yeah , you and I once talked about doing something like that . We were gon na call it , `` From Plant to Pusher . '' Remember ?

ARNIE: I want two paragraphs for the blotter .
JOHN: So uh , what kind of puppy ? Sebastian looks up at him .
SEBASTIAN: Get her a lab . They 're supposed to be just like little kids . But easier to train .

JENNY: You really sure about this ? I mean , a puppy 's a lot of work .

JENNY: What 's that ?
JOHN: I think we just met the dad .
JENNY: Call me as soon as you get him home . Oh , hey , we need a name .
JOHN: How 'bout I just call him `` Clearance Puppy '' until you get back . I only hope he does n't say his first word without you .
LORI: You should see him pack away the puppy chow .
JOHN: So , what if I run into any problems ?
BACKING AWAY: Oh . Sure , call me . All sales are final , though . Not just for him . I tell that to everyone .

SPANISH ACCENT: I read your piece on Kadahfi , And I think you captured his narcissism just ight .
LAUGHS: Can you believe that ?
JOHN: Some of it .
SEBASTIAN: Man , I wish you could 've been there .
JOHN: Yeah , but then I would n't have been able to do the piece on the water main eak at the library . That would have sucked .
SEBASTIAN: Your time will come , amigo .
JOHN: I 'll drink to that
SEBASTIAN: You got ta be somewhere ?
JOHN: Oh . No , it 's the puppy . It 's his first
SEBASTIAN: You got adoc ?
JOHN: Marley . A little lab . Like you said . Remember ? The bomb

THEN: Hey . Remember this ? One love , one heart
MARLEY QUIETS: Let 's get together and feel alright

JOHN: I 'll be back in an hour . Be good .
JENNY: How 's my puppy ?
JOHN: I 'm okay . A little tired , but

JOHN: He gave me an extra paragraph Marley bursts through the back screen door
JENNY: Happy Thanksgiving Marley goes through a hedge and out onto
JOHN: I do n't understand , why me ?
ARNIE: I 'm in a bind , John .
JOHN: But I 'm a reporter , not a columnist .
ARNIE: It 's a step up .
JOHN: Yeah , but it 's a step away from what I wan na do .
ARNIE: It 's also better pay , you set your own hours , pick your own topics
JOHN: What happened to Jerry ?
ARNIE: You may have noticed that in every other column , he went on about The Pie Palace ?
JOHN: I really have n't read his
ARNIE: Turns out he 's been getting free meals in exchange for mentioning the joint . It 's also why he became such a fat ass . John nods . Oh .
GIRL: Your dog 's funny .
PAUSES: Uh , thanks .
GIRL: He tried to eat one of our tires .
JOHN: Yeah , well , dogs need rubber . Little known fact , helps the digestive tract
GIRL: Right . Along with the occasional black Converse high top which I 'd still love to get back by the way .
JOHN: I 'll do what I can .
GIRL: 'Preciate that .
JENNY: I think he dislocated my shoulder . He does n't heel hell , he does n't even walk , he sprints , and I had to pull him off three dogs
JOHN: Poodle ?
JENNY: Yeah , among others . There was a Yorkie , a Dalmatian and a bichon frise that may never be right again . What 're you doing ?
JOHN: Arnie gave me a column .
JENNY: You 're kidding ? Congratulations !
JOHN: Oh , yeah , it 's a big honor . I get to write about zoning laws and yard sales .
JENNY: I bet you make something out of it .
JOHN: It 's only temporary until he finds someone else . I 'm just trying to get something down for Tuesday . She gives him a kiss , starts out of the room
JENNY: You 'll think of something . And John , I 'm serious abut Marley . He wreaks havoc everywhere he goes . We got ta do something
MS. KORNBLUT: Incorrigible ? I do n't believe in that . All dogs want to learn . But they ca n't when their owners are weak-willed .
JOHN: I 'm very strong-willed .
MS. KORNBLUT: And where is your animal ?
JOHN: He 's over there . With my wife . He was a little excited . He usually needs a little time to calm down .
MS. KORNBLUT: I see . He calls the shots . Which of you will be the trainer ?
JENNY: we thought we both would , since we want him to listen to both of us at home -
MS. KORNBLUT: A dog can only answer to one master . Which one of you has the most natural authority in your own relationship ?
BEAT: I 'll watch .
MS. KORNBLUT: I thought so . We begin .
JOHN: Yeah , he looks really bummed . Kornblut hears him , death stares John .
MS. KORNBLUT: You . Joker . Rotate in .
JOHN: Does it hurt them ?
MS. KORNBLUT: Well , it 's not called a hug chain . But they learn to like it . Go on , colla your dogs .
JOHN: He likes it .
MS. KORNBLUT: That 's because he 's eating it Get it out of his mouth . Class ? Give you dogs the sit command .
JOHN: That means us , pal . He rearranges Marley so he 's on John 's left .
MS. KORNBLUT: Now , when you give the heel command , step off with your left foot - I do n't want to see any right foot first steppers - and walk . If your dog gets ahead , administer a correction by forcefully bring your left hand down and towards the right , and he 'll espond . Shall we ? One , two , three - now !
JOHN: Marley , heel !
MS. KORNBLUT: Correct him !
JOHN: Be my guest .
MS. KORNBLUT: Class ? Even an unruly dog wants to obey his leader . Marley ? Heel .
JOHN: He usually just does this with poodles . Maybe it 's the hair .
MS. KORNBLUT: He 's a bad influence on the others . Leg-humping is a virus . Once it takes hold in a group - he has to go !
JOHN: Well , that was fun . Congratulations , Marley . You flunked obedience school .
JENNY: You know , John , there is something else we can do
JOHN: No , no , I 'm not doing that to him .
JENNY: It 's painless . And he 'll be a lot more comfortable . It 'll calm him down .
JOHN: Yeah , you know why he 'll be calmer ? Because he 'll have nothing to look forward to .
JENNY: What 're you talking about ? There are plenty of other things that 'll make him
JOHN: That 's where you 're wrong . Trust me , Jen I know . I 'm a guy . And yeah , lots of things make us happy , but the only thing we really look forward to is sex . Runner up the possibility of sex .
JENNY: Oh , Please . Every book says he 'll live
JOHN: It 'll just feel longer .
JENNY: John , he 's out of control . It 's the ight thing to do .
JOHN: It wo n't be so bad , buddy . You 'll see . Sex is overrated . Marley looks-at him .
JENNY: He 's making me nervous .
JOHN: He 's fine . He just wants a little
JENNY: John , grab him !
JOHN: He 's onto our evil plan , and he 's making a break for it !
JENNY: I got him !
SHOUTING: What are you looking at ? ! He 's losing his balls today ! Cut the guy some slack !
SEBASTIAN: Strip mall get approved ?
JOHN: Riveting planning commission vote . Knuckle-biter . 8 to 1 .
SEBASTIAN: You up for a beer ?
JOHN: Ca n't , I got ta finish the column . Maybe tomorrow ?
SEBASTIAN: Ca n't , I 'll be in L.A. Part of that drug piece I 'm doing
JOHN: Right . Another time then .
ARNIE: The hell you sorry for ? It 's hilarious .
JOHN: Thank you , sir . John starts out of the office .
ARNIE: Hey , Gorgan
THEN: Tell him not to feel bad . Sooner o later , we all lose our balls .
JOHN: I 'll be sure to pass that on .
JENNY: That was fast .
JOHN: Good , though , right ?
JENNY: Really good .
JOHN: So . What 's next ?
JENNY: I was thinking desert .
JOHN: No , I mean on your list .

JOHN: afterthat ? We can do that . What was
BEAT: You sure you wan na know ?
JOHN: Yeah .
JENNY: well , it was between a new roof and a aby . He studies her for a long moment , then
JOHN: I can probably live with a few leaks .
JENNY: Really ? Because a leak can turn into something bigger and that can be a ig responsibility .
JOHN: I know .
JENNY: I was just thinking that we might want everything fixed before we went to the next step .
JOHN: Well , we 've already fixed Marley . Literally .
JENNY: You 're serious about this ?
JOHN: I think so . JENNY t an And you know we 're not talking abou actual roof here .
JENNY: Okay . Maybe , instead of tying to have a baby , we should stop trying to not have one .
JOHN: If I 'm following you correctly and I think I am this is the part where we go home and get it on , right ?
JENNY: Bingo .
JOHN: Yeah
JENNY: Did you eat some kibble ?
JOHN: What ?
KNOW: it 's fine , he 's a dog , he does n't what he 's looking at .
RESENTS: Oh , he knows , and trust me , he the hell out of me right now . Go on , Marley ! Get out !

JENNY: Out in a sec ! John stands there , Marley looking at him .
JOHN: So . This is us not trying .
JENNY: Hey , Sailor .
JOHN: Catch you later , buddy . And closes the door on the dog .
SEBASTIAN: So the puppy was n't enough ?
JOHN: Well , technically , we 're not trying . But you know Jenny .
SEBASTIAN: But things are good right now , just as they are , right ?
JOHN: Yeah , things are really good .
SEBASTIAN: So why change it up with a kid ? I mean , have you already forgotten my little cautionary tale

JOHN: Can I ?
JENNY: By all means .
JOHN: Thank you . Okay , well I got ta be honest , I 'm a little panicked .
JENNY: Are you panicking because I 'm pregnant or because you 're afraid I 'm going to hit you ?
JOHN: Both . It 's a twofer thing .
JENNY: Are you scared ?
JOHN: No . No . Not at all . Yeah , yeah I 'm pretty scared .
JENNY: Me , too . But we 're gon na be okay .
THEN: Look at me He looks at her . She smiles at him .

JENNY'S VOICE: Debby . Welcome to our home ! Marley is a spirited dog who loves interaction . We 've never left him before but we 're sure he 'll behave just as he does when we 're at home .
JENNY'S VOICE: There are just a few things about Marley you need to know . He eats three times a day . If he looks starved , feed him again . Of course all this food has to go somewhere .

JENNY: You wan na join them ? He looks at her .
JOHN: Are you sure , because we do n't have to
JENNY: I ca n't help myself . Knowing it has n't happened in this house in 50 years is a turn-on .

JOHN: You mean , like forever ?
ARNIE: That 's what the word `` forever '' means . Yes .
THEN: John , you know how many yo yo 's in the other room would kill to have their own column ? You took a piece of crap About Towner and turned it into something fresh .

JENNY: I got overwhelmed , John . I mean , be . one tells you how hard it 's gon na
JOHN: Which part ?
JENNY: All of it . Marriage . Being a parent . It 's the hardest thing in the world and no one prepares you for that . No one tells you how much you have to give up .
THEN: me . I gave up so much of what makes me But I 'm not allowed to say that . People think you 're a bad person if you say that . But it 's how I feel sometimes , and I need you to know that .
JENNY: It 's not your fault . It 's just something I have to figure out . But Marley going , that wo n't fix anything .

JENNY: Baby , I got news for you , our life is wherever we are . And you 're not happy here anymore , doing that column . You 're restless , John . I feel it . I feel it when you read Sebastian 's articles every day . And I feel it when you sit out in the driveway an extra five minutes before you come in .
THEN: Maybe it 's time for a change .
JOHN: I 'm forty , Jen . Seems kinda late fo that .
JENNY: Not so late .
JOHN: What 're you doing ?
JENNY: We 're not old , John . We can still surprise ourselves .
JOHN: Uh-oh
ARNIE: Hey , Gorgan . John smiles to himself , walks over .
JOHN: Thank you , sir .
ARNIE: Also , there 's a good chance that every piece of advice I ever gave you , may in fact be total crap .
JOHN: I appreciate it just the same . They stand there a moment , awkward . Then
ARNIE: This would be where a mushier guy would tell you he 's proud of you , give you a hug , and send you on your way .
JOHN: Really glad you 're not that guy , sir .
CONOR: Hey , Marley ! We 're up here !
PATRICK: He ca n't hear you with the engine going .

JOHN: That 's alright , pal . I wo n't tell .
THEN: We kicked ass down that hill , did n't we ? John smiles at him and continues up to bed .
PATRICK: Hey , boy .
JOHN: Hit me , I 'm open !
COLLEEN: Mommy says dinner and take off you shoes .
JOHN: Alright c'mon guys
CONOR: What 's wrong with him , Daddy ?

JOHN: That 's right . Football just took it out of him . C'mon , let 's give him a hand .
EDITOR: Yeah , I mean , do n't get me wrong , it 's a good piece , but you 're reporting now , John . I want you to tell the story , I do n't want you to be in the
JOHN: I 'm pretty sure I do n't mention myself

JENNY: What 's wrong ?
JOHN: He 's not coming .
JENNY: Marley ! John starts off into the dark
JOHN: He ca n't be too far
PATRICK: Bobby says dogs , when they 're going to die , they go away to do it . That 's what his beagle did .
JOHN: And that 's true for beagles . But not labs like Marley . He 's just out there making trouble somewhere . Do n't worry
OVER TO: Jenny . Shooting Draft 109 .
JOHN: It 's okay , boy , it 's okay
DR. PLATT: He 's on an IV for fluids and a sedative .
JOHN: So what happened ?
DR. PLATT: His stomach twisted . He ate or drank something quickly , took in a lot of ai and his stomach flipped . I got a tube down which let out some of the gas . I think i untwisted it .
JOHN: So he 's okay
DR. PLATT: For now . But once this happens , it almost always happens again . And if it does , there 's not gon na be anything I can do . He 's too old for that kind of surgery .
JOHN: What if it does n't happen again ?
DR. PLATT: More than likely , it will .
JOHN: But what if it does n't ?
DR. PLATT: I just think you should prepare yourself that he might not make it through the night .
THEN: Maybe one percent of dogs ever survive
JOHN: One percent ? What 's that number based on ?
DR. PLATT: Mr. Grogan
JOHN: I 'll tell you what it 's based on egular dogs . Lady , we are so far from 'regular '' , you have no idea .
INDICATES MARLEY: My guy here He once ate an entire answering machine , and digested it . Then went back and ate the phone fo dessert . So do n't give me numbers like `` one percent , '' because you do n't know him . But I do , and I 'll see him in the morning .
JOHN: We 're just gon na have to wait and see . If he makes it through the night , I think we 'll be alright . He notices the album .
JENNY: Your old columns . He 's in a lot of 'em .
JOHN: You saved these ?

SEBASTIAN: What 's with the ladybug get-up ?
JOHN: Oh , yeah , that 's a funny story . She had done this pageant at her preschool two weeks before , but she did n't wan na take off the costume , plus Marley went allistic for the antenna which is why it looks like he 's trying to eat he head .
FLAT: Yeah , that is funny . So I was thinking later on maybe Thai ? There 's this new place in the meat Packing District . How 's that sound ? Be just like old times .
JOHN: Uh , well , actually I 'm headed back home later today .
SEBASTIAN: Oh .
JOHN: In fact , I should probably get going

JOHN: Everyday stuff . The stuff we all go through . But funnier .

JOHN: I did , but I think we both know that is n't me . I 'm a columnist . A good one . A SECRETARY sticks her head in the office
SECRETARY: John your wife 's on the phone . She says it 's important
JOHN: I 'll be right there . Think about it .
JENNY: I ca n't get him back inside . He 's lying out there in cold and he wo n't move

COLLEEN: You can take Lamby , okay ? But do n't chew her other ear off .
PATRICK: Goodbye .
JOHN: You wan na walk ?
DR. PLATT: I did everything that worked before . But no luck . There 's still surgery ,
JOHN: not strong enough .
DR. PLATT: There 's blood in his stomach . The lining might be compromised . I do n't know what we 'll find if we go in there anyway .
JOHN: Can you give me a minute ? I need to I need to call my wife .

LUCY: Stay , just stay . Martha comes back and sits on the bed .
UPSET: Why would you think it was okay to come in like that ?

LUCY: I know .
TED: I am under so much pressure right now-
LUCY: I know you are .
TED: I have a month to get this building up and running or the bank takes it .
LUCY: That has nothing to do with Martha .
TED: My point is , I do n't need the extra stress .
LUCY: I 'm her only family . She needs to be able to depend on me right now .
BEAT: It 's complicated Ted .
TED: As complicated as it might be , we ca n't just keep ignoring the fact that he ehavior is fucking insane . Martha pretends to go back to sleep .
MARTHA: Do you ever hear things hitting the roof at night ?
LUCY: No . Maybe it 's the pine cones .

LUCY: You can tell me .
MARTHA: He never hit me . Beat .
LUCY: I wish you felt more comfortable talking to me .

KATIE: Do n't stare ! Zoe walks back to the garden .
MARTHA: You okay ?
ZOE: Yeah . He 's right . I do n't know why I 'm so weak .
MARTHA: You 're not . You 'll quit .

MARTHA: You think ?
KATIE: You 're ready . Zoe can help but you 'll be great .
MARTHA: Whose car was that ?
LUCY: I do n't know . Why ?
MARTHA: Just curious .
LUCY: There 's a hiking trail , people leave their cars there all the time .
YOUNG MAN: It 's okay .
LUCY: You 're going to hurt someone . Martha is distracted .
MARTHA: What 's wrong with the tap ?
LUCY: I like bottled .
MARTHA: It 's a waste .
LUCY: Will you get it or not ?
MARTHA: Did you know that guy ?
LUCY: What guy ?
MARTHA: The guy in the store .

LUCY: I do n't think we should have the party .
TED: It 's labor day , we always have it .
LUCY: Things are just too stressful right now .
TED: I 've already invited clients .
LUCY: I 'm sure people would understand-
TED: They would n't .
LUCY: I just think it would be best .
TED: For who , Martha ?
LUCY: For all of us .
TED: It 's not an option ! We 're having the party .
LUCY: And that 's the end of it , because you say so .
TED: Yes !
MARTHA: We share all of this , if it fits , you can wear it .
SARAH: Cool . They walk into a small bedroom .
MARTHA: This is where we sleep . You can take any ed that 's open or you can sleep downstairs .
SARAH: I 'm hungry , can we eat ?
MARTHA: We do n't eat until the evening .
SARAH: Really ?
MARTHA: You 'll get used to it . Your body does n't need that much food . You 're taught to overconsume . There is a baby asleep in the crib .
SARAH: He 's beautiful . Whose the mother ?
MARTHA: Katie 's , but we all help out .
SARAH: Is Patrick the father ?
MARTHA: Uh huh .
SARAH: They look just like him .
BEAT: All the kids here are boys ?
MARTHA: He only has boys .
SARAH: You 're good with them .
MARTHA: You want to hold him ?
SARAH: No Thanks .
BEAT: I do n't have to take care of them do I ?
MARTHA: Not if you do n't want to . There are plenty of jobs to be done .
BEAT: You 'll find your role . It takes time fo people to find their role in a new family .
ZOE: I called my dad today to ask for money .
MARTHA: Does Patrick know ?
ZOE: He asked me to . Sometimes , if there 's something we really need I 'll call .
MARTHA: How was it ?
ZOE: Fine , they 're not bad people .
MARTHA: Did he give you the money ?
ZOE: Yeah . He thinks I 'm on drugs .
MARTHA: Do you tell him you 're not ?
ZOE: No , that 's why he gives it to me . I guess he 'd rather pay for it than think I 'm sucking dick for it .
SARAH: I 've done drugs . Not a lot but I 've tried everything pretty much , except heroin .
ZOE: It 's good to try everything at least once . You find out who you are that way . What about drinking , do you drink ?
SARAH: I have , but I do n't .
ZOE: Good , we do n't drink . It just makes you angry and less focused .
MARTHA: Do n't get the wrong idea Sarah . We do n't talk to our old families .
SARAH: I would n't call my Dad anyway , no matte how much he paid me . Patrick and Watts walk out of the woods .
PATRICK: Hey .
MARTHA: Hi Patrick , Did you meet Sarah yet ?
PATRICK: Sally , yeah .
KATIE: That 's enough . Katie hands her a large chalky white pill .
LUCY: I 'll do these if you want to go to bed .
MARTHA: I do n't mind .
LUCY: Get some sleep .
MARTHA: Okay .
SARAH: Hi .
MARTHA: Nothing you do n't want to . Drink this , it will help you relax .
SARAH: Do I have to wear this robe ?
MARTHA: I know it seems a bit silly , but it 's a part of it .
SARAH: Thanks .
MARTHA: Should n't we start cooking ?
LUCY: I just made some potato salad . Ted 's cooking the fish .
MARTHA: I thought we were going to cook .
LUCY: We cooked last night .
MARTHA: Oh , yeah . Martha is lost deep in thought .
LUCY: Not really . Beat .
MARTHA: No .
BEAT: Like what ?
LUCY: I do n't know .
BEAT: I 'm just trying to figure out why we stopped talking .
MARTHA: I did n't think about it .
LUCY: Really ?
MARTHA: We were far apart .
LUCY: Sometimes I wonder if , maybe I could have taken better care of you .
MARTHA: The past does n't matter .
LUCY: It does matter .
MARTHA: I took care of myself .
LUCY: I know you did . I think I could have done more though .
MARTHA: Stop it .
LUCY: Be honest with me , you never think about it ?
MARTHA: No .
LUCY: You 're not angry at me ?
MARTHA: I know you do n't think much of me but I knew what I was doing then and I still do .
LUCY: No , Martha , I think the world of you , I 'm just wondering if I should have come back and kept you in school and helped you go to college , you had so much potential .
MARTHA: I do n't need your guidance , I never did . I 'm a teacher and a leader , you just never let me be that but now I know I am , I know who I am .
LUCY: Teacher and a leader ? What are you talking about ? I always encouraged you to do more , but you shut me out .
MARTHA: Just because we 're sisters does n't mean we need to talk about everything that comes into your head .
YELLING: Dinner 's ready .
TED: So what are your plans Martha ?
MARTHA: For what ?
TED: Life .
MARTHA: I do n't know .
TED: Are you thinking about what you can do for work ?
MARTHA: No .
TED: You 're at an age where you need to start thinking about a career .
MARTHA: Why ?
TED: It 's a part of adult life .
MARTHA: There are other ways to live .
TED: Really ?
MARTHA: Sure .
TED: Like what ?
MARTHA: I do n't know . People do n't need careers , people should just exist . Ted laughs .
LUCY: He 's just saying we should start talking about what you 're interested in . Maybe we can help you get some ideas together .
TED: I have moments when I would love to move to France and just exist but it does n't work that way .
MARTHA: You can do that if you want to .
TED: It 's not that simple .
MARTHA: It 's not your fault but you learned that success is measured by money and possessions . It 's just not the right way to live .
TED: And what do you think the right way to live is ? Being a hysterical mess and causing your family pain . You 're eating my food and sleeping under my roof so watch your mouth . You 're rude .
MARTHA: You do n't know anything about it . Ted and Lucy are speechless . Martha leaves .
WOMAN: HelloHello .
MARTHA: Who 's this ?
WOMAN: Who 's this ?
BEAT: Zoe ?
MARTHA: She not there ?
WOMAN: She 's not .
MARTHA: Where is she ?
WOMAN: Who is this ?
MARTHA: Who is this ?
WOMAN: It 's Marlene Lewis . Who 's this .
MAX: Watts said I 'm supposed to teach you how to defend yourselves but I think you 're hopeless .
ZOE: I 'm surprised your dumb ass even knows how to load it .
MAX: Please , I 'm like Doc fuckin ' Holiday .
ZOE: What happened Doc ? I should be teaching you .
MARTHA: Alright , my turn .
ZOE: Alright Max , was this just an excuse to grope Marcy .
MAX: I 'm teaching her how to shoot . Then you just squeeeeeeeeeze .
PATRICK: Focus . Take a deep breath . Think about someone who wronged you . Feel it , feel how they made you feel in your stomach . Take a deep breath , feel it all moving out into your hands . Let it build . It 's transferring to the gun , building in the gun . Now release .
SMILING: Feels good right ?
MARTHA: What do you mean ?
PATRICK: Shoot it .
MARTHA: They 're living animals .
PATRICK: So , shoot Max then .
MAX: Fuck this .
PATRICK: Do n't walk away from me Max .
MARTHA: I ca n't .
PATRICK: Max has no substance , he 's just here to free load and be around the girls but you 're a teacher and leader , you just do n't see it because no one let you elieve it before me . You 're a leader a Marcy , now prove it .
MARTHA: I trust you .
PATRICK: Then you should n't need me to explain everything .
MAX: You said it was sick .
PATRICK: One of them was sick , Zoe knew which one it was ! Max tosses the gun and walks away .
MARTHA: You okay ?
MAX: I 'm fine .
BEAT: I 'll probably leave this place soon anyways .
MARTHA: Where are you going to go ?
MAX: I got places . My cousin lives in Bennington , he said I could go up there and make like , $ 500 a week selling weed .
MARTHA: You do n't want to do that .
MAX: I do n't care what I do . I 'm sick of all these rules .
MARTHA: Max , they 're not rules . It 's just common sense .
MAX: It feels like rules . They wo n't let me do anything . I ca n't even go on the house uns . I 'd be great at taking shit .
MARTHA: It 's not about taking shit .
MAX: Sounds like it 's about taking shit to me .
MARTHA: And that 's why you do n't get to come . You just do n't get it .
BEAT: You need to quit drinking .
MAX: I 'm not drinking .
MARTHA: You 're still living with all the shit you carried out there . You 're the only one , let it go .
MAX: I 'll try .
MARTHA: No . You ca n't try . You have to stop . They love you , they just want you to be stronger .
MAX: I 'm strong , they 'll see .
MARTHA: You 'll be okay .
TED: Jesus Christ you scared me .
MARTHA: Sorry . They take a moment to calm down .
TED: Did I wake you ?
MARTHA: No . I ca n't sleep .
TED: Me neither . I was going to watch a movie .
BEAT: You want to watch ? Martha thinks about it .
MARTHA: I should try to sleep .
TED: It always helps me . It 's better than lying in bed awake . He takes a couple of beers out of the fridge .
MARTHA: It 's alright . It 's your house .
TED: You want me to make some breakfast ? Lucy walks away .
LUCY: You can not be serious right now .
TED: What ? Beat .
LUCY: One minute you 're going after Martha at the dinner table , then you 're curling up together on the couch ?
TED: No one was curling up with anybody .
LUCY: You really do think I 'm stupid do n't you ?
TED: Jesus , I could n't sleep , I was watching a movie , she came out and sat down and started watching with me . What am I supposed to do , tell her to leave ? Beat .
LUCY: You can lose your temper at will but when I get pissed off , I 'm being crazy o idiculous ! I could n't possibly be mad for a reason . Lucy gets undressed and gets in the shower .
TED: Are you accusing me of something ? Because if you are , I 'd like you to say it out loud so you can hear how absurd it sounds .
LUCY: Fuck you . I just want you to think about how walking in on that might make me feel .
TED: You ask me to make more of an effort . I try to do that and you get upset . I ca n't win .
LUCY: You 're unbelievable .
MARTHA: You should n't smoke .
LUCY: What ? I do n't smoke .
MARTHA: Especially if you 're trying to have a kid .
LUCY: Maybe you should mind your own business . The phone rings . It startles Martha .
MARTHA: What 's you name ?
BARTENDER: I 'm sorry ?
MARTHA: What 's your name ?
BARTENDER: Mike .
MARTHA: I used to like this . She points at the tequila .
BARTENDER: Straight ?
MARTHA: I thought you were n't supposed to drink Mike .
BARTENDER: I 'm not drinking .
MARTHA: You think you 're so fucking smart . Martha storms inside . Lucy follows her in .
LUCY: Hey , what happenind ?
MARTHA: We all need to leave .
LUCY: What ?
MARTHA: He 's a fucking liar . We all need to leave . She points to the bartender .
LUCY: What are you talking about ?

MAN: What the fuck .
WATTS: Hey , we can go . The man is confused .
MAN: What do you want ?
WATTS: Nothing .
PATRICK: Calm down , if you calm down no one will get hurt .
MAN: What do you want ?
PATRICK: We 're not stealing , we do n't want anything .
MAN: Just get out .
PATRICK: We 're just looking at the house . It 's nice .
BEAT: We did n't realize you were home . We would n't have come in otherwise .
MAN: Just Leave .
PATRICK: I would but I ca n't be sure you wo n't call the police .
MAN: I wo n't . You did n't take anything so just go , I just want my family to be safe .
PATRICK: Safe ? Why would n't anyone be safe . Unless you call the police , everything will be fine .
MAN: Okay , I wo n't . You have my word , please just go .
PATRICK: Look at me . Patrick runs his hands through her hair .
MARTHA: Uh huh .
PATRICK: You know that death is the most beautiful part of life , right ? Death is beautiful ecause everyone fears death . And fear is the greatest human emotion of all because it creates complete awareness . When you 're scared it forces you to be completely aware of your surroundings and the moment you 're in . It brings you to NOW and that makes you truly present . And when you are truly present , that 's nirvana , that 's pure love . So , death is pure love .
LUCY: It 's too hot , let it cool for a minute .
MARTHA: Thanks mom . I 'm sorry I ruined the party .
LUCY: Everything was fine .
MARTHA: Is it over ?
LUCY: Yes , you slept through the night .

MAX: Yeah , I 'm good Marcy . Stop .
MARTHA: How long do you think we 'll be down here ?
ZOE: It 'll just be a few days . Just to be safe .
MARTHA: Do you feel alright ? If you hit your head you should n't sleep .
MAX: I 'm fine .
MARTHA: Do you know why we 're down here ?
MAX: No . Do you ? She shakes her head .
MARTHA: What do you think it was ?
MAX: I do n't know . It does n't matter .
MARTHA: Do you still think about leaving ?
MAX: No . It 's cool now , I do n't really have anywhere to go . Why , would you ?
MARTHA: No . I just wanted to see about you .

LUCY: I do n't want to talk about it anymore .
MARTHA: Zoe ?
ZOE: Yeah .
MARTHA: I ca n't stop feeling terrible for that poor man .
ZOE: I know . It happens though , we 're neve eally dead or alive , we just exist , so he 's still existing , but it 's in a parallel time . Just do n't think about it , it 's in the past . Martha is upset with how cold Zoe is .
PATRICK: Have n't you learned anything ?
MARTHA: I have .
PATRICK: I felt like we had a connection .
MARTHA: We do !
PATRICK: That 's not what you 're showing me . Patrick calms down . He sits .

LUCY: We 're going to get you proper help . There is a long moment of silence .
MARTHA: Are you going to send me away ?
LUCY: I do n't know how to help you anymore .
MARTHA: Please do n't . Please do n't .
LUCY: I ca n't help you .
MARTHA: Please , I ca n't be alone , please .
LUCY: We 're trying to start a family and I do n't trust you to be here . Lucy walks away .
MARTHA: Lucy ?
LUCY: What ? Lucy stops at the bottom of the stairs .
MARTHA: You 're going to be a terrible mother .
LUCY: Do you have any money left ? Martha shakes her head .
BEAT: We 'll make sure everything is taken care of .
LUCY: Going swimming ?

JOHANSSEN: 11.6 11.5 holding at 11.5
MARTINEZ: Still at pilot release . Ready fo launch . Lewis closes her eyes . Nods .
LEWIS: Launch .
TEDDY: At around 4 30 a.m. , central standard time , our satellites detected a storm approaching the Ares 3 mission site on Mars .
MORE: 12 .
THEN: Unfortunately , during the evacuation , Astronaut Mark Watney was struck by debris and killed . Commander Lewis and the rest of her team were able to intercept safely with the Hermes and are now heading home But Mark Watney is dead .
CONTINUED: 13 .
MARK: Fuck .
MARK: Okay . Okay
THINKS: Obviously . But I 'm guessing this is going to be a surprise to my crewmates . And NASA . And the world . So surprise .
THEN: I did n't die on Sol 18 . Best I can tell - Mark holds up the jagged piece of antenna .
CONTINUED: 17 .
THEN: I have hundreds of liters of unused Hydrazine from the MDV . If I run the Hydrazine over an iridium catalyst , it 'll separate into N2 and H2
MARK: Then I just need to direct the hydrogen into a small area and burn it . Luckily , in the history of humanity , nothing bad has ever happened from lighting hydrogen on fire .
CONTINUED: 20 .
MARK: So . Yes . I blew myself up .
THEN: Best guess ? I forgot to account for the excess oxygen I 've been exhaling when I did my calculations . Because I 'm stupid . He 's still dazed . A little out of it .
CONTINUED: 21 .
THEN: See ? I pay attention .
CONTINUED: 22 .
TEDDY: Our nation was blessed to have Mark serving in our space program . His loss will be deeply felt , but the men and women of NASA will soldier forth , onward and upward , unbroken in the mission of their agency . In doing so , they hono the legacy Mark leaves behind , and they ensure his sacrifice will not be in vain .
CONTINUED: 23 .
VINCENT: I thought you gave a lovely speech , by the way .
TEDDY: It 's not gon na happen .
VINCENT: We 're funded for five Ares missions . I think I can get Congress to authorize a sixth .
TEDDY: No .
VINCENT: They evac 'd after eighteen sols . There 's half a mission worth of supplies up there . I can sell another mission at a fraction of the cost . I just need to know what 's left of our assets .
CONTINUED: 24 .
TEDDY: You 're not the only one who needs satellite time . We 've got the Ares 4 supply missions coming up . We should be focusing on the Schiaparelli Crater .
VINCENT: I 'm talking about securing us anothe mission . We have twelve satellites in orbit , we can surely spare a few hours
TEDDY: It 's not about the satellite time , Vince . Vincent shrugs then what is it ?
VINCENT: And ?
TEDDY: The second we point the satellites at the Hab I broadcast pictures of Mark Watney 's dead body to the world .
VINCENT: You 're afraid of a PR problem ?
TEDDY: Of course I 'm afraid of a PR problem . Another mission ? Congress wo n't eimburse us for a paper clip if we put a dead astronaut on the cover of The Washington Post .
VINCENT: So what do we do ? He 's not going to decompose . He 'll be there forever .
TEDDY: Meteorology estimates he 'll be covered in sand from normal weather activity within a year .
VINCENT: We ca n't wait a year for this . We have work to do .
CONTINUED: 25 .
TEDDY: Ares 5 wo n't even launch for another five years . We have plenty of time .
VINCENT: Okay , consider this . Right now , the world is on our side . Sympathy fo Watney 's family is high
MINDY: Acidalia Planitia
CONTINUED: 26 .
WOMAN: Oh you have GOT to be SHITTING ME
TEDDY: How sure ?
VINCENT: Nearly 100 % .
ANNIE: Do you understand the shitstorm that 's about to hit us ?
TEDDY: Annie , one thing at a time .
TO VINCENT: Prove it to me .
VINCENT: For starters , the solar panels have been cleaned .
TEDDY: They could have been cleaned by wind .
VINCENT: Look at Rover 2 . According to the logs , Commander Lewis took it out on Sol 17 . Plugged it into the Hab to recharge . It 's been moved .
TEDDY: She could have forgotten to log the move .
VINCENT: Here 's the clincher . Check the MDV . It 's been taken apart . There 's no way they do that without telling us .
CONTINUED: 27 .
ANNIE: Why do n't we talk to Lewis ? Let 's go to CAPCOM and ask her directly right now .
TEDDY: No . If Watney is really alive we do n't want the Ares 3 crew to know .
ANNIE: What ? How can you not tell them ?
TEDDY: They have another ten months on thei trip home . Space travel is dangerous . We need them alert and undistracted .
ANNIE: They already think he 's dead .
VINCENT: And they 'd be devastated to find out they abandoned him alive .
ANNIE: You 're on board with this ?
VINCENT: We have to protect the crew . There 's nothing they can do anyway . Let them deal with the emotional trauma when they 're not trapped in a spaceship .
TEDDY: How do we handle the public ?
ANNIE: We have twenty-four hours before we 're equired to release the pics .
TEDDY: We 'll need to release a statement with them . We do n't want people working it out on their own .
ANNIE: `` Dear America . Remember that astronaut we thought we killed and had a nice funeral for ? Turns out he 's alive and we left him on Mars . Our bad . Sincerely ,
CONTINUED: 28 .
TEDDY: I need to get on a plane to Chicago .
VINCENT: Mark 's parents .
TEDDY: They should hear it from me before it eaks on the news .
ANNIE: They 'll be happy to hear their son 's alive , at least .
TEDDY: He 's alive . But if my math is right , he 's gon na starve to death long before we can help him .
THEN: I 'm not exactly looking forward to that conversation . Vincent 's eyes drift to the images of Mars .
VINCENT: Can you even imagine what he 's going through ? He 's fifty million miles from home . He thinks he 's totally alone and that we all gave up on him . What kind of effect does that have on a man 's psychology ?
THEN: What 's he thinking about right now ?
MARK: if I have to listen to any more goddamn disco music .
CONTINUED: 29 .
THEN: I 'm not turning the beat around . I efuse to .
MARK: But here 's the rub . I 've got two rovers designed to go a max distance of 35 kilometers before they need to be echarged at the Hab . That 's problem A . Problem B is it 'll take me roughly fifty days to make the journey . So I have to be able to live for fifty days . Inside a rover with marginal life support the size of a small van .
CONTINUED: 30 .
THEN: I 'm gon na have to science the shit out of this .
MARK: Okay , so success ? I 've doubled my attery life by scavenging Rover 1 . BUT . If I use the heater , it 'll eat up half my attery power every day . If I do n't use the heater , I will be slowly killed by the laws of thermodynamics . I 'd like to solve this problem , but unfortunately my brain is frozen . Mark drives back towards the Hab .
MORE: 31 .
MARK: But . As long as I do n't break it
HESITATES: I almost said `` everything will be fine '' out loud . My point is
MARK: I 'm not cold anymore . And yes , I could choose to think about the fact that I 'm warm because I have a decaying adioactive isotope riding shotgun next to me , but right now I have bigge problems on my hands . I 've scoured every single data file on Commander Lewis ' personal drive , and this is officially the LEAST disco song she owns .
REPORTER 1: Where is Watney going ?
CONTINUED: 32 .
VINCENT: We believe he 's preparing for a journey . He 's conducting incremental tests taking Rover 2 out for longer and longe trips each time .
REPORTER 2: To what end ? Why would he leave the elative safety of the Hab ?
VINCENT: Communication . We believe he plans to travel to the Ares 4 launch site in orde to make contact with us . But it would be a dangerous gamble .
REPORTER 3: He 'd be risking his life to talk to you ?
VINCENT: This is the problem Mark faces . He 's alone . And he needs to make contact to survive . But if we could talk to him , we 'd tell him to stay put . Mark needs to trust we 're doing everything in our powe to bring him home alive .
ANNIE: Do n't say `` Bring him home alive . '' It eminds the world he might die .
VENKAT: You think people might forget that ?
ANNIE: You asked how you did and I 'm giving you my answer . My answer is `` Eh . '' And yes , I 'm going to make everyone forget there 's a strong likelihood Mark Watney is going to die because that 's what you pay me fo and unfortunately I need this job because I 'm currently paying alimony to two deadbeat ex-husbands because somehow gender equality has bitten me square in the ass .
CONTINUED: 33 .
VENKAT: Hard to believe tha
ANNIE: I left them .
TEDDY: Do n't say `` Bring him home alive , '' Vincent .
VINCENT: You know , these interviews are n't easy . God forbid I try to say something proactive and positive .
TEDDY: Annie
ANNIE: No more Vincent on television . Copy that .
TEDDY: Seventy-six kilometers . Am I reading that right ? Nobody 's quite sure who Teddy is asking .
MINDY: Are you asking me ?
TEDDY: I am .
MINDY: Yes , sir . Mark drove straight away from the Hab for almost two hours , did a short EVA , then drove for another two . We think the EVA was to change batteries .
GRUFF MAN: Are we doing a daddy/daughter thing today ? Where 's the Director of SatCon ?
CONTINUED: 34 .
VINCENT: Ms. Park is the person who figured out Mark was alive in the first place . She 's in charge of tracking him now .
TEDDY: Quit being a dick , Mitch . Where 's Mark going ? Is this another test ?
MINDY: He 's seventy-six kilometers away from the Hab . If it 's a test and it does n't work he 's dead .
TEDDY: He did n't load up the Oxygenator or the Water Reclaimer ?
MINDY: I did n't see that happen , no sir .
TEDDY: You did n't see it ?
MINDY: Every forty-one hours , we have a seventeen minute gap . It 's just the way the orbits work . So it 's possible we missed something .
TEDDY: I want that gap down to four minutes . I 'm giving you total authority ove satellite trajectories and orbital adjustments . Make it happen .
MINDY: Okay .
TEDDY: Let 's assume Ms. Park did n't miss something , so Mark 's not going to Ares 4 . Yet . But he 's smart enough to figure out that 's his only chance . Bruce , what 's the earliest we could get a presupply there ?
CONTINUED: 35 .
BRUCE: With the positions of Earth and Mars , it 'll take nine months . And it 'll take us six months to build it in the first place .
TEDDY: Three months .
OFF BRUCE: You 're gon na say that 's impossible , then I 'm gon na give a speech about the linding capabilities of the JPL team . And then you 'll do the math in your head and say something like `` The overtime alone will be a nightmare . ''
BRUCE: ( oh god I did n't even think
OF THAT: The overtime will be a nightmare .
TEDDY: Get started . I 'll find you the money .
MITCH: It 's time to tell the crew .
VINCENT: Mitch , we discussed this .
MITCH: You discussed this . But I 'm the one who decides what 's best for the crew . They deserve to know .
TEDDY: Sorry , Mitch . I 'm with Vincent . They need to concentrate on getting home .
MITCH: Bullshit .
TEDDY: Once we have a real rescue plan , we 'll tell them . Otherwise it 's moot . Bruce has three months to get the payload done . That 's all that matters right now .
BRUCE: We 'll do our best .
TEDDY: Mark dies if you do n't .
THEN: But , by the way , none of this matters , at all , if I do n't figure out how to make contact with NASA
MARK: I know what I 'm gon na do .
MINDY: He 's on the move again Vincent huddles over Mindy 's screen .
VINCENT: Where the hell is he going ? He has n't changed course in thirteen days . And he 's nowhere near course for Ares 4
MINDY: Unless he 's not taking a direct route . Maybe he 's trying to avoid some obstacle
CONTINUED: 37 .
VINCENT: What obstacle ? It 's Acidalia Planitia . There 's nothing out there but
TECHNICIAN: Hey c'mon
VINCENT: I 'll buy you a new one .
TO MINDY: What 's the Hab 's location ?
MINDY: 31.2 degrees north , 28.5 degrees west .
VINCENT: I know where he 's going .
TECHNICIAN: Who 's he talking to ?
MINDY: I 'm honestly not sure .
CONTINUED: 38 .
VINCENT: What are the odds Mark can get it working again ?
BRUCE: Hard to say . We lost contact in ` 97 . We think it was battery failure .
THEN: Though I 'd like to point out it lasted three times longer than expected in any scenario .
VINCENT: Nobody 's criticizing JPL 's work , Bruce . I want talk to everyone who was here in
BRUCE: They 're already waiting for you .
VINCENT: This the replica ? Bruce nods , pulls off the sheet to reveal
CONTINUED: 39 .
TIM: As soon as I received the high-gain esponse , I directed Pathfinder to take a panoramic image .
VINCENT: Have you received it yet ?
TIM: Yes , but I thought we would all rathe look at this black screen instead of a vibrant red planet .
BRUCE: Tim is our finest comm tech , and we all appreciate his acerbic wit . Bruce mouths `` I will fire you '' to Tim .
TIM: Incoming .
VINCENT: Martian surface more surface
BRUCE: There 's the Hab !
VINCENT: What 's that ?
CONTINUED: 41 .
TIM: Thirty-two minute round trip communications time . He can only ask yes/no questions , and all we can do is point the camera . This wo n't exactly be an Algonquin round table of snappy epartee .
BRUCE: Tim .
TIM: Roger that . Pointing the camera
MARK: Somehow , we need to have complex astrophysical engineering conversations using only a still-frame camera . From 1996 . Luckily , the camera spins 360 , so I can make an alphabet . I just ca n't use our alphabet . Twenty-six letters plus question card into 360 gives us 13 degrees of arc . Too narrow . I would n't know what the camera was pointing at . So . Hexadecimals to the rescue
CONTINUED: 42 .
CONTINUED: 43 .
VINCENT: We 've been watching you since Sol 54
TIM: `` Glad to hear it . Really looking forward to not dying . ''
BRUCE: Tell him . Hm . Tell him
TIM: He says `` They do n't know I 'm alive ?
HESITATES: `` What the f-word f-word in gerund form f-word again is wrong with you f-words . ''
VINCENT: Mark , please watch your language
CONTINUED: 45 .
MITCH: I made the mistake of typing it into Google . Do n't .
THEN: Problem is , Mark 's right . This is only gon na get worse the longer we wait . We need to tell the crew .
TEDDY: You 're bringing this up while Vincent 's in Pasadena so he ca n't argue the othe side .
MITCH: I should n't have to clear this with you or Vincent or anyone else .
THEN: It 's time , Teddy . Teddy thinks about it .
LEWIS: Go ahead .
CONTINUED: 46 .
LEWIS: You 're in a hurry .
MARTINEZ: My son turned three yesterday . Should be some pics of the party .
JOHANSSEN: All right , we 've got a batch of personals . Dispatching them to you laptops I do n't need to read Vogel 's weird German fetish emails
VOGEL: They are telemetry updates .
JOHANSSEN: Whatever does it for you . We 've got a system update , I 'll take care of that , and huh . There 's a voice message . Addressed to the whole crew .
LEWIS: Play it . Johanssen opens the message . Hits play .
MORE: 47 .
MARTINEZ: He He 's alive ? Vogel cracks a smile .
VOGEL: Watney lives .
BECK: Holy shit . Commander ! He 's alive !
LEWIS: I left him behind .
JOHANSSEN: Commander it was n't
BECK: We all left together .
LEWIS: You were following orders .
THEN: I left him behind .
CONTINUED: 48 .
MARK: They 've got a room full of people trying to micromanage my crops . Which is awesome . Look , I do n't mean to sound arrogant here , but I 'm the best botanist on the planet . So .
THEN: One big bonus of this NASA communication Email ! Just like the days on the Hermes , I get data dumps . Not just friends and family , but NASA also sends choice messages from the public . Rock stars , athletes , even The President . The coolest one is from my alma mater , the University of Chicago . They say once you grow crops somewhere , you have officially `` colonized '' it . So , technically , I colonized Mars .
ANNIE: I ask for a picture and I get the goddamn Fonz ?
TEDDY: Let 's release the photo when we detail the rescue operation . I want to announce we 're launching some supplies to him next year during the Hohmann Transfer window .
CONTINUED: 50 .
TEDDY: Nine-month travel time , that puts the probe to Mars on Sol 868 . Did we get the Botany Team 's analysis ?
MITCH: Grudgingly ?
TEDDY: Get him in line , Vincent . We ca n't afford any miscommunication . I hate this margin . 912 sols worth of food . We get there on 868 . And that 's assuming nothing goes wrong
CONTINUED: 52 .
VINCENT: Complete loss of pressure boiled off most of the water .
MORE: 54 .
ANNIE: How long does he have ?
VINCENT: He can still eat the potatoes he has , he just ca n't grow any more . We estimate they 'll give him about 200 sols .
TEDDY: And rations get him to what ? Sol 409 ?
VINCENT: So with potatoes he can stretch to 609 .
ANNIE: By Sol 868 he 'll be long dead .
TEDDY: We 're gon na have to launch as soon as possible . Which changes our travel time .
MITCH: We 're working on it . Prelim estimates call for a four-hundred fourteen day trip .
TEDDY: It 's Sol 135 now . We need thirteen days to mount the boosters and perform inspections . Which gives Bruce and his team
FUCK: Forty-seven days to make this probe .
ANNIE: How long does it normally take ?
VINCENT: Six months . Minimum .
TEDDY: I 'm gon na let you call Bruce and give him the news .
CONTINUED: 55 .
BRUCE: Okay .
LONG PAUSE: Okay .
CONTINUED: 56 .
MARTINEZ: `` How 's the Hermes ? Cramped and claustrophobic ? Every day I go outside and look at the vast horizons just ecause I can . ''
THEN: `` Tell the others I said hello . ''
CONTINUED: 57 .
MIKE: Rich ? Wake up . Sorry , they 're asking for the probe courses .
RICH: What time is it ?
MIKE: 3 42 .
RICH: It 's all right . All twenty-five models will take four-hundred fourteen days to each Mars . They vary only slightly in thrust duration , and the fuel requirement is nearly identical .
MIKE: ( looking at Rich 's
CALCULATIONS: Four-hundred fourteen days . Not an ideal time to launch , is it ?
RICH: Earth and Mars are really badly positioned . Heck , it 's almost easie to Rich trails off .
MIKE: Almost easier to what ?
RICH: I need more coffee
MIKE: Almost easier to what ? Rich walks out of the room .
VINCENT: `` the probe will take 414 days to reach you , and will deliver enough food to last you to Ares 4 . ''
MINDY: Tell him about the name .
VINCENT: `` We 've officially named the probe ` Iris ' ''
TEDDY: Okay , let 's ask the Two hundred million dollar sorry , five hundred That 's a `` five ? '' Let 's ask the very , very expensive question is this probe gon na be ready on time ?
BRUCE: We 're behind .
CONTINUED: 59 .
TEDDY: Give me a number .
BRUCE: Fifteen days . If I had another fifteen days , I could get it done .
TEDDY: All right , let 's create fifteen days . Thirteen days to mount the probe . Can we educe ?
VINCENT: It actually only takes three days to mount it . We can get that down to two . But the other ten are for testing and inspections .
TEDDY: How often do those inspections reveal a problem ?
MITCH: Are you suggesting we do n't do the inspections ?
TEDDY: Right now I 'm asking how often they eveal a problem .
VINCENT: About one in twenty launches . But that 's grounds for a countdown halt . We ca n't take that chance .
TEDDY: Anyone else know a safer way to buy more time ? Nobody does .
VINCENT: Teddy
CONTINUED: 60 .
TEDDY: It 's on me , Vincent .
TO BRUCE: You 've got your two weeks . Get it done .
MARK: So . I have to hold out until the probe gets here with more food . And this is what `` minimal calorie count '' looks like . Standard issue ration . But instead of three every one day , I 'm now eating one every three days .
OPENS PACK: Oh good . Meatloaf .
MITCH: Do you believe in God , Vincent ?
VINCENT: Several . My mother 's Catholic and my father 's Hindu .
MITCH: We 'll take all the help we can get . Mitch puts on his headset .
MITCH: Launch , what 's happening ?
COMMS: We 've lost readings on the probe , Flight .
MITCH: Shit . It shook loose in the bay .
GUIDANCE TELEMETRY: L.O.S . here , too . Same here . The voices go SILENT . The alarms BLARE . Then
MITCH: SatCon ?
SATCON: No satellite acquisition of signal .
CAPCOM: Flight , US Destroyer Stockton reports debris falling from sky .
CONTINUED: 64 .
MITCH: Roger .
MORE: 65 .
THEN: Tell them I said I can live with that .
VOICE: Their astronaut is going to die .
ZHU: Perhaps . Perhaps not . The Taiyang Shen 's booster . Ou engineers have run the numbers , and it has enough fuel for a Mars injection orbit . TITLE GUO MING , Director , CNSA
CONTINUED: 66 .
GUO: Why has n't NASA approached us ?
ZHU: They do n't know . Our booster technology is classified .
GUO: So if we do nothing
ZHU: The world would never know we could have helped .
GUO: Then . Merely for the sake of argument , let 's say we decide to help them
ZHU: We 'd be giving up a booster and effectively cancelling Taiyang Shen .
GUO: We need to keep this among scientists . A cooperation between space agencies
TEDDY: Yes .
BRUCE: All right , thanks to our friends in China , we get one more chance at this . We finished the Iris probe in sixty-three days . Now we get to do it again in twenty-eight
VINCENT: We 're jettisoning any sort of landing system the idea is we 're only sending ations , so they can crash land on Mars
SECRETARY: WAIT
RICH: You should hang up the phone .
VINCENT: I 'm sorry who are you ?
RICH: My name is Rich Purnell and I work in astrodynamics and you should hang up the phone right now .
VINCENT: I 'll call you back . Rich hands Vincent his summary .
ANNIE: What the hell is `` Project Elrond ? ''
VINCENT: I had to make something up .
CONTINUED: 68 .
ANNIE: `` Elrond ? ''
MITCH: Because it 's a secret meeting .
ANNIE: How do you know that ? Why does `` Elrond '' mean `` secret meeting ? ''
BRUCE: The Council of Elrond . From Lord of the Rings . It 's the meeting where they decide to destroy the One Ring .
ANNIE: I so quit right now .
TEDDY: If we 're calling something Project Elrond , I would like my codename to be `` Glorfindel . ''
ANNIE: Oh my god I hate every one of you .
MITCH: Teddy does n't even know what this is about ?
VINCENT: Tell them exactly what you told me .
RICH: I can get the Hermes back to Mars by Sol
MITCH: What ?
TEDDY: How ?
RICH: Okay let 's pretend this stapler is the Hermes . And you are I 'm sorry , what 's your name again ?
CONTINUED: 69 .
TEDDY: Teddy .
THEN: I 'm the Director of NASA .
RICH: Okay , Teddy , you 're Earth . And right now the Hermes is heading towards you and is about to start its month-long deceleration to intercept . But , instead , I 'm proposing
DEMONSTRATES: We start accelerating immediately , to preserve velocity and gain even more . We do n't intercept Earth at all , but we come close enough to use a gravity assist to adjust course . While we 're doing that He grabs the pen out of Teddy 's pocket .
VINCENT: The Taiyeng Shen .
RICH: Pick up whatever provisions we need and then we 're accelerating towards Mars .
TO ANNIE: You 're Mars . And we 're going too fast at this point to fall into orbit , so it 's a flyby .
BRUCE: What good is a flyby if we ca n't get Watney off the surface ?
VINCENT: Watney would have to intercept using the
RICH: And we head back home . I 've done the math . It checks out .
CONTINUED: 70 .
TEDDY: Rich ?
RICH: Yes sir ?
TEDDY: Get out .
VINCENT: I believe so .
TEDDY: And we need to use the Taiyeng Shen ?
VINCENT: Yes .
ANNIE: What am I missing ? Why is that important ?
VINCENT: Because we can only do one .
TEDDY: Send Watney enough food to last until Ares 4 , or send Hermes back to get him ight now .
VINCENT: Both plans require the Taiyang Shen , so we have to choose .
ANNIE: What about the Hermes crew ? We 'd be asking them to add 533 days to their mission .
MITCH: They would n't hesitate . Not for a second . That 's why Vincent called this meeting . He wants us to decide instead . Vincent nods . That 's correct .
CONTINUED: 71 .
VINCENT: It 's a matter of life and death , Mitch . We need to make this decision .
MITCH: She 's the Mission Commander . Life and death decisions are her damn job .
TEDDY: Can the Hermes function for 533 days eyond the scheduled mission end ?
VINCENT: It should . The Hermes was made to do all five Ares missions , so it 's only halfway through lifespan .
ANNIE: But if something went wrong
VINCENT: We would lose the crew . And the Ares Program with them .
BRUCE: So what ? We either have a high chance of killing one person , or a low chance of killing six people . How do we make that decision ?
VINCENT: We do n't . Teddy does .
TEDDY: We still have the chance to bring five astronauts home safe and sound . I 'm not isking their lives .
MITCH: Let them make that decision .
TEDDY: Mitch . We 're going with option one . Mitch stares at Teddy . Quietly seething .
CONTINUED: 72 .
MITCH: You goddamn coward .
MINDY: He 's been doing EVAs throughout the day . Vincent is hovering over Mindy 's station .
VINCENT: And nobody gave him instructions ? Did JPL schedule something ?
CONTINUED: 73 .
MINDY: He 's at the Rover .
THEN: We 're receiving a transmission .
VINCENT: Commander Lewis ' geo-compositing experiments . Mindy frowns . I 'm sorry , what ?
MARK: We evac 'd eighteen sols into a thirty-one sol mission Which means we 've got thirteen sols of experiment and research schedules . For each of us . So . Commander Lewis your work 's in good hands . Beck I 'll be honest with you , I do n't understand chemolithotrophic detection . At all . But I 'm doing my est . Johanssen , I know you do n't like it when I touch the ChemCam , but guess what ? I 'm touching the ChemCam . Vogel , I think I 've got a new cataloguing system for the core samples that I 've titled `` Das Core Samples '' out of respect for the Fatherland . And Martinez I still do n't know what it is you do . Why did we ing you ? No idea .
THEN: I 'm trying to keep everything documented and organized .
MORE: 74 .
VOGEL: I have a problem .
JOHANSSEN: Let 's take a look . Huh . This is n't a jpg . It 's a plain ASCII text file . Looks like I do n't know what this looks like . Math equations . Does this make any sense to you ?
VOGEL: `` Rich Purnell Maneuver . '' Ja . It is a course maneuver for the Hermes
CONTINUED: 75 .
LEWIS: and the mission would conclude with Earth intercept 211 days later .
MARTINEZ: Would this really work ?
LEWIS: We ran the numbers . They check out .
VOGEL: It 's a brilliant course .
BECK: Why all the cloak and dagger ?
LEWIS: NASA rejected the idea . They 'd rathe take a big risk on Watney than a small isk on all of us . Whoever snuck it in Vogel 's email obviously disagreed .
MARTINEZ: So . We 're talking about going directly against NASA 's decision ?
LEWIS: Yes . If we do the maneuver , they 'll have to send the supply ship or we 'll die . We have the opportunity to force their hand .
JOHANSSEN: Are we gon na do it ?
LEWIS: If it were up to me , we 'd already be on our way .
CONTINUED: 76 .
MARTINEZ: Is n't it ? Up to you , I mean .
LEWIS: Not this time . This is something NASA expressly rejected . We 're talking about mutiny . Which is not a word I use lightly . We do this together , or not at all . Before you answer , consider the consequences . If we mess up the supply endezvous , we die . If we mess up the Earth gravity assist , we die . If we do everything perfectly , we add 533 days to our mission . 533 more days before we see our families again . 533 days of unplanned space travel where anything could go wrong . Something might break that we ca n't fix . If it 's mission critical , we die .
MARTINEZ: Sign me up .
LEWIS: Easy , cowboy . You and I are military . There 's a good chance we 'd be court- martialed when we got home . As for the est of you , I guarantee they 'll neve send you up again .
BECK: If we go for it how would it work ?
VOGEL: I plot the course and execute it .
JOHANSSEN: Remote Override . They can take over the Hermes from Mission Control .
LEWIS: Can you disable it ?
JOHANSSEN: Hermes has four redundant flight computers , each connected to three edundant comm systems . We ca n't shut down the comms ; we 'd lose telemetry and guidance . We ca n't shut down the computers ; we need to control the ship . I 'd have to disable the Remote Override on each system It 's part of the OS , I 'd have to jump over the code
CONTINUED: 77 .
BECK: Johanssen used to go by the hacker handle `` Lady Sorrow '' in high school . Just so we 're all on the same page .
JOHANSSEN: Beck is a liar . And he should keep ou conversations private .
THEN: But , yeah . I can do it .
LEWIS: It has to be unanimous . If anyone says no , that 's it . We go home as planned . But I vote yes .
MARTINEZ: I vote yes .
VOGEL: If we do this , it would be over nine hundred days of space . That is enough space for one life .
THEN: Yes . Beck thinks about it long and hard . Then
BECK: Let 's go get him .
LEWIS: Johanssen ?
CAPCOM: Flight , CAPCOM .
BRENDAN: Go CAPCOM .
CAPCOM: Unscheduled status update from Hermes .
CONTINUED: 78 .
BRENDAN: Roger . Read it out .
CAPCOM: II do n't get it , Flight . No real status . Just a single sentence .
BRENDAN: What 's it say ?
CAPCOM: Message reads `` Houston , be advised Rich Purnell is a steely-eyed missile man . ''
BRENDAN: What ? Who the hell is Rich Purnell ?
GUIDANCE: Flight , Guidance .
BRENDAN: Go Guidance .
GUIDANCE: Hermes is off-course .
BRENDAN: CAPCOM , advise Hermes they 're drifting . Guidance , get a correction ready
GUIDANCE: Negative , Flight . It 's not drift , they 've adjusted course . Deliberate 27.812 rotation .
BRENDAN: What the hell ? CAPCOM , ask them what the hell .
CAPCOM: Roger Flight . Message sent . Minimum eply time 3 minutes , 4 seconds .
BRENDAN: Telemetry , any chance this is instrumentation failure ?
TELEMETRY: Negative , Flight .
BRENDAN: Oh god . Guidance , Flight .
CONTINUED: 79 .
GUIDANCE: Go Flight .
BRENDAN: Work out how long they can stay on this course before it 's irreversible .
GUIDANCE: Working on that now , Flight .
BRENDAN: And somebody find out who the hell Rich Purnell is !
TEDDY: Annie will go before the media this morning and inform them of NASA 's decision to reroute the Hermes to Mars .
MITCH: That seems like the smart move . Considering the circumstances .
TEDDY: You may have killed the whole crew .
MITCH: Whoever gave them the maneuver only passed along information . The crew made the decision on their own .
TEDDY: We 're fighting the same war . Every time something goes wrong , the world forgets why we fly . I 'm trying to keep us airborne . This is bigger than one person .
MITCH: No . It 's not .
TEDDY: When this is over I 'll expect you esignation .
CONTINUED: 80 .
MITCH: I understand .
TEDDY: Bring our astronauts home .
THEN: We 'll get there .
CONTINUED: 81 .
MARISSA: Five hundred and thirty-three days longer ? And you said yes to this ?
MARTINEZ: I did . He would have done the same fo me . You know that .
MARISSA: And you think I 'm gon na forgive you ?
MARTINEZ: I do .
CONTINUED: 83 .
MITCH: All due respect to your CNSA protocol , we have n't done things that way since Apollo
MARK: Here 's the cool part . I leave this morning for the Schiaparelli crater , where I will commandeer the Ares 4 lander . Nobody explicitly gave me permission to do this , and they ca n't until I 'm aboard the Ares 4 . So I will take control of a craft in international waters without permission . Which , by definition , makes me a pirate .
THEN: Mark Watney , Space Pirate . It 's better than winning the Nobel Prize .
CONTINUED: 86 .
THEN: I 'm the first person to be alone on an entire planet .
VINCENT: How 's our boy doing ?
CONTINUED: 87 .
MINDY: So far , so good . He 's sticking to schedule . Drives for four hours before noon . Then sets the solar panels . And waits thirteen hours while they recharge . Sleeps somewhere in there . Then starts again .
VINCENT: How 's his morale ?
MINDY: He 's asked us to call him `` Captain Blondebeard . ''
VINCENT: Mars would be governed by maritime law , so technically
MINDY: Yeah , he explained it to us .
BRUCE: Okay , we 're gon na start by stating , fo the record , that you 're not gon na like this . Vincent starts to look through the plans .
CONTINUED: 88 .
MITCH: The problem is the intercept velocity . The Hermes can not enter Mars orbit , o they 'll never have enough fuel to make it home . The MAV is only designed to get to Low Mars Orbit . So in order for Mark to escape Mars ' gravity entirely and intercept the Hermes
VINCENT: He needs to be going fast .
BRUCE: Which means we need to make the MAV lighter . A lot lighter . Five-thousand kilograms lighter .
VINCENT: You can do that ?
BRUCE: There were some gimmes right off the bat . The design presumes 500 kilograms of Martian soil and samples . Obviously , we wo n't do that .
MITCH: There 's just one passenger instead of six . With suits and gear , that saves another 500 . Then we ditch the life support . We do n't need it . We 'll have Watney use his EVA suit for the whole trip .
VINCENT: How will he use the controls ?
MITCH: He wo n't . Martinez will pilot the MAV emotely from the Hermes .
VINCENT: We 've never had a manned ship controlled emotely before . But I 'm excited for the opportunities that affords .
CONTINUED: 89 .
BRUCE: If we go remote , we can lose the control panels . Then we dump the secondary and tertiary comm systems .
VINCENT: You 're going to have a remote controlled ascent with no backup comms ?
MITCH: He 's not even to the bad stuff yet , Vincent . Really ?
VINCENT: You better skip to the bad stuff .
BRUCE: We have to remove the nose airlock , the windows , and Hull Panel 19 .
VINCENT: You 're taking the front of the ship off ?
BRUCE: Sure . The nose airlock alone is 400 kilograms .
VINCENT: You 're going to launch a man into space with a giant hole in the front of the ship ?
BRUCE: Well no . We 're gon na have him cove it with Hab canvas . Vincent puts his head in his hands .
VINCENT: You 're sending him to space under a tarp .
BRUCE: Yes . Can I go on ?
CONTINUED: 90 .
THINKS GENUINELY: I 'm not really sure I want you to , but okay .
MINDY: Mark says `` Are you f-word-ing kidding me ? ''
VINCENT: Do you think he meant it like
EXCITED: `` Are you kidding me ? '' Or more
ANGRY: `` Are you kidding me ? ''
MINDY: ( does n't want to hurt
VINCENT'S FEELINGS: It 's possible he meant it the first way ?
MARK: I know what they 're doing . I know what they 're doing . They keep repeating `` accelerate faster than any man in the history of space travel '' like this is a good thing , like this 'll distract me from how insane their plan is . Oh really ? I get to be the fastest man in the history of space travel ? You 're launching me into space in a convertible . No no , it 's worse , because I do n't have any controls . You 're launching me into space in a tin can . And , by the way , physicists do n't even use words like `` fast '' when describing acceleration , so they 're only doing it in hopes I wo n't raise any objections because I like the way `` fastest man in the history of space travel '' sounds . Well , you know what ?
MORE: 91 .
THEN: Okay , fine . Let 's do this .
JOHANSSEN: And you killed him . Lewis shrugs . The taskmaster .
LEWIS: Try it again . Martinez reboots the simulator
LEWIS PRELAP: Here 's the plan
LEWIS: Martinez will fly the MAV . Johanssen will sysop the ascent . Beck and Vogel , I want you in Airlock 2 with the outer doo open before the MAV even launches . Once we reach intercept , it 'll be Beck 's jo to get Watney .
CONTINUED: 93 .
BECK: He might be in bad shape . The stripped down MAV will get up to 12 g 's during the launch . He could be knocked unconscious and may have internal bleeding .
LEWIS: Well , then it 's a good thing you 're ou doctor . What 's the intercept plan ?
BECK: We finished attaching the tethers into one long line . It 's 214 meters long . I 'll have the MMU , so moving around should be easy .
LEWIS: How fast a relative velocity can you handle ?
BECK: Once I get to Mark ? I can grab the MAV at 5 meters per second . 10 is like jumping onto a moving train . Any more than that and I might miss .
LEWIS: We 've got some leeway . The launch will e 52 minutes before the intercept and it takes 12 minutes . As soon as Mark 's engine cuts out we 'll know our intercept point and velocity .
BECK: Good . And 214 meters is n't a hard limit , per se .
LEWIS: Yes . It is .
BECK: I take off the tether , I could get way out to
LEWIS: Not an option . Vogel , you 're Beck 's ackup . All goes well , you 're pulling them back aboard with the tether . If things go wrong , you 're going out afte them .
VOGEL: Ja .
CONTINUED: 94 .
LEWIS: All right . Let 's go get our boy .
ANNIE: If something goes wrong , what can Mission Control do ?
VINCENT: Not a damned thing . It 's all happening twelve light-minutes away . That means it takes twenty-fou minutes for them to get the answer to any question they ask . The whole launch is twelve minutes long . They 're on thei own .
ANNIE: Not that we have a choice , but are we sure we want to be broadcasting this to the world ? I mean , if something goes
VINCENT: Yes .
MORE: 95 .
RESOLUTE: We want to be broadcasting this .
LEWIS: About two minutes , Watney . How you doing down there ?
MARK: It 's good to hear your voice , Commander . I 'm eager to get up to you . He fails . His voice breaks .
LEWIS: We 're on the case . Remember , you 'll be pulling some pretty heavy G 's . It 's okay to pass out . You 're in Martinez ' hands .
CONTINUED: 96 .
MARK: Tell that asshole no barrel-rolls .
LEWIS: Copy that , MAV . CAPCOM CLOSE ON JOHANSSEN , at her station .
JOHANSSEN: Go .
LEWIS: Remote Command CLOSE ON MARTINEZ , grinning in anticipation .
MARTINEZ: Go .
LEWIS: Recovery
BECK: Go .
VOGEL: Go .
LEWIS: Pilot And finally
MARK: Go .
MARTINEZ: Main engines start .
JOHANSSEN: 8 7 mooring clamps released
LEWIS: About five seconds , Watney . Hang on .
MARK: See you in a few , Commander .
JOHANSSEN: Velocity 741 meters per second . Altitude 1350 meters
LEWIS: That 's too low
MARTINEZ: I know . It 's fighting me
JOHANSSEN: Velocity 850 , altitude 1843
LEWIS: Watney ? Watney , do you read ? Can you eport ?
JOHANSSEN: He 's well below target altitude .
LEWIS: How far below ?
JOHANSSEN: Working on it Main shutdown in 3 2 1 Shutdown .
MARTINEZ: Back to automatic guidance . Confirm shutdown .
LEWIS: Watney ? Do you read ?
CONTINUED: 99 .
LEWIS: Copy .
JOHANSSEN: I have interval pings . Intercept velocity will be 11 meters per second
GOES PALE: We 'll be 68 kilometers apart .
BECK: Did she say 68 kilometers ? Kilometers ?
MARTINEZ: Oh my god
LEWIS: Keep it together . Work the problem . Martinez , do we have any juice in the
MARTINEZ: Negative , Commander . They ditched the OMS system to make launch weight .
LEWIS: Then we have to go him . Johanssen , time to intercept ?
JOHANSSEN: 39 minutes , 12 seconds
LEWIS: What if we point our attitude thrusters all the same direction ?
MARTINEZ: Depends on how much fuel we want to save for attitude adjustments on the trip home .
CONTINUED: 100 .
LEWIS: How much do you need ?
MARTINEZ: I could get by with maybe 20 percent of what 's left .
LEWIS: JOHANSSEN
JOHANSSEN: Use 75.5 percent of remaining attitude adjust fuel . That 'll bring the intercept ange to zero .
LEWIS: Do it .
JOHANSSEN: Hang on that gets the range to zero , ut the intercept velocity will be 42 meters per second
LEWIS: Then we have 39 minutes to figure out how to slow down . Martinez , burn the jets .
MARK: MAV to Hermes
CONTINUED: 101 .
MARK: My chest hurts . I think I broke some ibs .
THEN: How are you ?
MARK: Yeah . The canvas did n't hold
LEWIS: That 's consistent with what we saw .
MARK: Well . Shit .
LEWIS: I ca n't see you having any control if you did that . You 'd be eyeballing the intercept and using a thrust vector you can barely control .
MARK: I would get to fly around like Iron Man .
LEWIS: We should have left him on Mars .
MARTINEZ: No , it actually is . The worst idea . Ever .
LEWIS: Not his part . But using atmosphere as thrust Martinez , get Vogel 's station up and unning
CONTINUED: 103 .
MARTINEZ: It 's up . What do you need ?
LEWIS: I need to know what happens if we blow the VAL .
MARTINEZ: You want to open the Vehicular Airlock ?
LEWIS: It would give us a good kick .
MARTINEZ: Yeah . And it might blow the nose of the ship off in the process .
JOHANSSEN: And all the air would leave . And we need air . To not die .
LEWIS: We 'll seal the bridge and reactor room . We let everywhere else go vacuo .
MARTINEZ: But we 'd still have the same problem as Watney . We ca n't direct the thrust .
LEWIS: We do n't have to . The VAL is in the nose . We just point the ship at Mark .
MARTINEZ: A breach at the VAL would decelerate us 29 meters per second .
JOHANSSEN: Which gives us a relative velocity of 13 meters per second .
LEWIS: Beck you hearing this ?
MARTINEZ: How do we open the airlock doors ? There 's no way to open them remotely , and if anyone 's nearby when it blows
CONTINUED: 104 .
LEWIS: Right right
THINKS: Vogel ?
LEWIS: Take your suit off .
THEN: I need you to come back in and make a omb .
MARK: Did you say `` bomb ? '' You guys are making a bomb without me ?
VOGEL: Um Again , please , Commander .
LEWIS: Beck leave your suit on . Meet Johanssen at Airlock 1 . We 'll open the outer door . I need you to place the charge on the inner door
BECK: Copy . On my way .
MARK: Commander , I ca n't let you guys do this . I 'm ready to puncture the suit . Let 's go with the Iron Man plan .
LEWIS: Absolutely not .
MARK: The thing is , I 'm selfish . And I want the memorials back home to be just me . I do n't want the rest of you losers in them .
EARNEST: Commander call it off .
LEWIS: Oh . Okay . Well , if you want us to call it off , then I guess we have to oh wait wait a minute . Yep . I 'm looking at my shoulder patch and it turns out I 'm Commander . So shut up .
MARK: Smart ass .
CONTINUED: 106 .
JOHANSSEN: Bomb ?
VOGEL: Bomb . In a pure oxygen environment , 16.7 million Joules will be released for every kilogram of sugar used . Eight times more powerful than a stick of dynamite . He pours LIQUID OXYGEN into the beaker .
JOHANSSEN: How do we activate it ?
VOGEL: Can you run this to one of our lighting panels ? Johanssen grins .
JOHANSSEN: Make sure you 're not still here when this goes off . He takes the bomb from her .
BECK: Bomb is set . On my way .
MARTINEZ: Guys , I 'm running the numbers even with optimal VAL blow , we 're gon na be off on our angle .
LEWIS: What 's the new intercept distance ?
IMPATIENT: Johanssen .
JOHANSSEN: 260 meters . Approximate .
LEWIS: That 's too far
MARTINEZ: Commander ?
LEWIS: The intercept distance is gon na be too far . I 'm going untethered .
BECK: Commander , I can do this
LEWIS: It 's not a debate , Beck . I 'm not risking another crew member .
CONTINUED: 108 .
LEWIS: We sure know how to cut it close .
JOHANSSEN: 10 seconds
MARTINEZ: Strap in . They tighten the restraints on their chairs .
JOHANSSEN: 5 4 3
LEWIS: Brace for deceleration .
JOHANSSEN: 2 1 Activating Panel 41 . She presses ENTER .
MARTINEZ: Damage ?
CONTINUED: 109 .
LEWIS: Copy .
JOHANSSEN: 312 meters .
MARK: You said 312 ? Great . I 'll wave at you guys as I go by .
LEWIS: Mark you 're still WAY TOO FAR I 'm not gon na make it
CONTINUED: 110 .
MARK: Commander . Seriously .
THEN: I got this .
MARK: ( having the time of his
LIFE: I have visual on the Commander .
LEWIS: Johanssen what 's my relative velocity to Mark ? And as our SCORE begins to BUILD
JOHANSSEN: 5.2 meters per second ANGLE MARTINEZ on the edge of his seat
MARK: Contact .
MARK: Hi guys . Everyone fighting back tears .
JOHANSSEN: Oh , hey Mark . Have n't seen you in a while .
MARTINEZ: Yeah . What 've you been up to ?
MARK: Oh . You know . Same old , same old .
VOGEL: You smell horrible .
MARK: I have n't showered in a year and a half . Cut me some slack .
CONTINUED: 113 .
JOHANSSEN: You do n't know what you 're asking us here .
MARTINEZ: Yeah , captain , we may need to put him ack .
MARK: I missed you guys . They hold each another .
THEN: Trust me , I know what I 'm talking about . The class laughs .
CONTINUED: 114 .
THEN: And you can either accept that or you can get to work . He lets those words land .
CONTINUED: 115 .
ANNIE: The Ares 5 team will rendezvous with the Hermes approximately 48 minutes afte launch . From there , they 've got 414 days of space travel ahead of them , arriving at Mars on March 30th . And I 'll let the Director of Mars Missions , Vincent Kapoor , brief you on the particulars .
VINCENT: Good morning . Their mission is scheduled for 41 Sols . Your briefs detail the esearch and experiment schedules And the MUSIC CONTINUES THROUGHOUT as

MRS. FUSARI: Your kid brother got married last Sunday , eh , Marty ?
MARTY: That 's right , Missus Fusari . It was a very nice affair .
MRS. FUSARI: That 's the big tall one , the fellow with the moustache .
MARTY: No , that 's my other brother , Freddie . My other brother Freddie , he 's been married four years already . He lives down on Webb Avenue . The one who got married Sunday , that was my little other , Nickie .
MRS. FUSARI: I thought he was a big tall fat fellow . Did n't I meet him here one time ? Big tall , fat fellow , he tried to sell me life insurance ?
MARTY: No , that 's my sister Margaret 's husband , Frank . My sister Margaret , she 's married to the insurance salesman , and my sister Rose , she married a contractor . They moved to Detroit last year . And my other siste Frances , she got married about two and a half years ago in Saint John 's Church on Kingsbridge Avenue . Oh , that was a big affair . Well , let 's see now , that 'll be about a dollar- seventy-nine . How 's that with you ?
MRS. FUSARI: Well
WOMAN'S VOICE: Hey , Marty , I 'm inna hurry .
MARTY: You 're next right now , Missus Canduso .
MRS. FUSARI: When you gon na get married , Marty ? You should be ashamed of yourself . All your brothers and sisters , they all younger than you , they married and they got children . I just saw your mother inna fruit shop , and she says to me , `` Hey , you know a nice girl for my boy Marty ? '' Watsa matte with you ? That 's no way . Now you get married .
MARTY: Missus Fusari , Missus Canduso ove there , she 's inna big hurry , and
MRS. FUSARI: My son Frank , he was married when he was nineteen years old . Watsa matte with you ?
MARTY: That 's swell , Missus Fusari .

YOUNG MAN: The Yanks took two .
MARTY: Any homers ?
RALPH: So these two girls come over to the ar
MARTY: Hey , Ang '
RALPH: and they sit down right next to me
MARTY: You want a beer , Ang ' ?
RALPH: I look over at this one nexta me , not bad , about thirty-five Hiya , Marty
MARTY: Hiya , Ralph
RALPH: I been talking about two nurses Leo and me picked up in a bar on Seventy-First Street .
MARTY: Hey , Lou , gim me two bottles-a beer
RALPH: So , Marty , lem me tell you about these nurses , Marty
MARTY: Waddaya read there , Joe ?
RALPH: Turns out these two girls are nurses in some hospital on a Hundred and Fourth Street
JOE: They should n't sell magazines like this on a public newsstand
MARTY: That 's the truth .
JOE: Can you imagine the effect this has on adolescents ?
RALPH: So , Marty , let me tell you about these nurses
MARTY: What nurses ?
RALPH: The nurses Leo and me picked up last night . We got a date with them tonight .
MARTY: You still owe me ten bucks from last week , if that 's what you 're working up to .
JOE: Now that 's something , eh ?
RALPH: I used to go out with a girl like that
THE KID: You should live so long .
ANGIE: So waddaya feel like doing tonight ?
MARTY: I do n't know , Ang ' . Wadda you feel like doing ?
ANGIE: Well , we oughta do something . It 's Saturday night . I do n't wan na go owling like last Saturday . How about calling up that big girl we picked up inna movies about a month ago in the RKO Chester ?
MARTY: Which one was that ?
ANGIE: That big girl that was sitting in front of us with the skinny friend .
MARTY: Oh , yeah .
ANGIE: We took them home alla way out in Brooklyn . Her name was Mary Feeney . What do you say ? You think I oughta give her a ring ? I 'll take the skinny one .
MARTY: She probably got a date by now , Angie .
ANGIE: Well , let 's call her up . What can we lose ?
MARTY: I did n't like her , Angie . I do n't feel like calling her up .
ANGIE: Well , what do you feel like doing tonight ?
MARTY: I do n't know . What do you feel like doing ?
ANGIE: Well , we 're back to that , huh ? I say to you , `` What do you feel like doing tonight ? '' And you say to me , `` I do n't know , what do you feel like doing ? '' And then we wind up sitting around your house with a coupla cansa beer , watching Sid Caesar on television . Well , I tell you what I feel like doing . I feel like calling up this Mary Feeney . She likes you .
MARTY: What makes you say that ?
ANGIE: I could see she likes you .
MARTY: Yeah , sure .
ANGIE: I 'll call her up .
MARTY: You call her up for yourself , Angie . I do n't feel like calling her up .
ANGIE: How about going downa Seventy-Second Street , see what we can find ? Ralph says you have to beat them off with clubs . Marty makes a wry face at the suggestion .
MARTY: Angie , I 'm thirty-four years old . I een looking for a girl every Saturday night of my life . I 'm tired of looking . Everybody 's always telling me to get married . Get married . Get married . Do n't you think I wan na get married ? I wan na get married . They drive me crazy . Now , I do n't wan na wreck your Saturday night for you , Angie . You wan na go somewhere , you go ahead . I do n't wan na go .
ANGIE: My old lady , every word outta he mouth , when you gon na get married ?
MARTY: My mother , boy , she drives me crazy .
ANGIE: So what do you feel like doing tonight ?
MARTY: I do n't know . What do you feel like doing ?
BARTENDER: Marty , your mother wants you onna phone .
MARTY: Come on over about half past seven , we 'll think of something . Hello , Ma , what 's the matter ?
MRS. PILLETTI: Hello , Marty , when you coming home ? Where you now ? Because your cousin Thomas and his wife Virginia , they 're here . They had another fight with your Aunt Catherine I do n't know
MARTY: I 'm coming home right now , Ma . I 'll e home in about two minutes . Tell Thomas stick around , I wan na see him about something .
MRS. PILLETTI: Okay , you come on home , okay .
VIRGINIA: So what happened , Aunt Theresa , about the milk bottle was my mother-in- law , she comes inna kitchen , Aunt Theresa , and she begins poking he head over my shoulder here and poking her head over my shoulder there , so then she begins telling me how I waste money and how I ca n't cook , and how I 'm raising my baby all wrong , so she got me so nervous , I spilled some milk I was making for the baby
MRS. PILLETTI: She was here , you know , Wednesday , and I said , `` Catherine , my sister ''
VIRGINIA: So she say , `` You 're spilling the milk . '' So she kept talking about these coupla drops of milk I spilled , so she got me so mad , so I said , `` Mama , you wan na see me really spill some milk ? '' So I took the bottle , and I threw it against the door . I did n't throw it at her . That 's just something she made up . She goes around telling everybody I threw the bottla milk at her . I did n't throw it anywheres near her . Well , I was sorry ight away , you know , but she ran outta the house .
MRS. PILLETTI: Well , I do n't know what you want me to do , Virginia . If you want me , I 'll go talk to her tonight .
THOMAS: Well , I 'll tell you , Aunt Theresa
VIRGINIA: Lem me tell it , Tommy .
THOMAS: Okay .
VIRGINIA: We want you to do a very big favo for us , Aunt Theresa .
MRS. PILLETTI: Sure .
VIRGINIA: Aunt Theresa , you got this big house here . I mean , you got this big house just for you and Marty . And I thought maybe Tommy 's mother could come here and live with you and Marty .
MRS. PILLETTI: Well
VIRGINIA: Because I called up Tommy 's brothe Joe , and I said , `` Joe , she 's driving me crazy . Why do n't you take her fo a couple of years ? '' And he said , `` Oh no ! '' I know I sound like a terrible woman
MRS. PILLETTI: No , Virginia , I know how you feel .
VIRGINIA: I just ca n't stand it any more ! Every minute of the day ! Do this ! Do that ! I do n't have ten minutes privacy with my husband ! We ca n't even have a fight ! We do n't have no privacy ! Everybody 's miserable in our house !
THOMAS: All right , Ginnie , do n't get so excited .
MRS. PILLETTI: She 's right . She 's right . Young husband and wife , they should have their own home . And my siste Catherine , she 's my sister , but I got ta admit , she 's an old goat . And plenty-a times in my life , I feel like throwing the milk bottle at he myself . And I tell you now , as fa as I 'm concerned , if Catherine wantsa come live here with me and Marty , it 's all right with me . Virginia promptly bursts into tears .
THOMAS: That 's very nice-a you , Aunt Theresa .
MRS. PILLETTI: We got ta ask Marty , of course .
THOMAS: Sure .
MRS. PILLETTI: You just sit here , I got ta turn the fire on under the cooking .
VIRGINIA: That 's very nice-a you , Aunt Theresa .
THOMAS: How 's Marty been lately , Aunt Theresa ?
MRS. PILLETTI: Oh , he 's fine . You know a nice girl he can marry ?
THOMAS: Oh , he 'll get married , do n't worry , Aunt Theresa .
MRS. PILLETTI: Well , I do n't know . He sits arounna house alla time . You know a place he can go where he can find a bride ?
THOMAS: Well , there 's the Stardust Ballroom . That 's a kind of a big dance hall . Every Saturday night , it 's just loaded with girls . It 's a nice place to go . You pay seventy-seven cents . It used to be seventy-seven cents . It must e about a buck and half now . And you go in and you ask some girl to dance . That 's how I met Virginia . Nice , respectable place to meet girls . You tell Marty , Aunt Theresa , you tell him , `` Go to the Stardust Ballroom . It 's loaded with tomatoes . ''
MRS. PILLETTI: The Stardust Ballroom . It 's loaded with tomatoes .
THOMAS: Right .
VIRGINIA: This is very nice-a you , Aunt Theresa , what you 're doing for us , and do n't think we do n't appreciate
MRS. PILLETTI: He 's here . She hurries into
MARTY: Hello , Ma .
MRS. PILLETTI: Marty , Thomas and Virginia are here . They had another fight with you Aunt Catherine . So they ask me , would it be all right if Catherine come to live with us . So I said , all right with me , but we have to ask you . Marty , she 's a lonely old lady . Nobody wants her . Everybody 's throwing he outta their house
MARTY: Sure , Ma , it 's okay with me .
MRS. PILLETTI: You got ta good heart .

I chased enough girls in my life . I went to enough dances . I got hurt enough . I do n't wan na get hurt no more . I just called a girl just now , and I got a eal brush-off , boy .

Somebody to take her home , you know what I mean ? I 'd be glad to pay you five ucks if you take her home for me .
MARTY: What ?
DR. KEEGAN: I 'll take you over , and I 'll introduce you as an old army buddy of mine , and then I 'll cut out . Because I got this other girl waiting for me out y the hatcheck , and I 'll pay you five bucks .

DR. KEEGAN: No , I 'm not kidding .
MARTY: You ca n't just walk off onna girl like that .
DR. KEEGAN: in that case , as long as she 's going home alone , give me the five ucks back
STAG: Look , Mac , you paid me the five bucks . I was willing . It 's my five bucks
MARTY: Excuse me , Miss , would you care to dance ?
VIRGINIA: Hello , Aunt Theresa . Come in . Mrs. Pilletti enters the apartment .
MRS. PILLETTI: Is Catherine here ? Virginia helps her with her coat .
VIRGINIA: We did n't tell her anything yet . We thought that we 'd leave it to you . We thought you 'd put it like how you were lonely , and why do n't she come to live with you . Because that way it looks like she 's doing you a favor , insteada we 're throwing her out , and it wo n't be so cruel on her . Do you want Tommy and me to stay here with you ?
MRS. PILLETTI: I think it be a better idea if you and Thomas go out , because otherwise she 's gon na start a fight with you , and everybody 's gon na be yelling .
THOMAS: Hello , Aunt Theresa .
MRS. PILLETTI: Hello , Thomas .
THOMAS: I just this minute got the baby to sleep .
MRS. PILLETTI: Do n't worry . I 'm gon na take care-a the whole thing .
CATHERINE'S VOICE: Who 's there ? ! Who 's there ? !
MRS. PILLETTI: It 's me , Catherine ! How you feel ?
CATHERINE: Hey ! What are you doing here ?
MRS. PILLETTI: I came to see you . How you feel ?
CATHERINE: I got ta pain in my left side , and my leg throbs like a drum .
MRS. PILLETTI: I been getting a pain in my shoulder .
CATHERINE: I got ta pains in my shoulder too . I have a pain in my hip , and my right arm aches so much I ca n't sleep . It 's a curse to be old . How you feel ?
MRS. PILLETTI: I feel fine .
CATHERINE: That 's nice .
MRS. PILLETTI: Well , how 's everything with you ?
CATHERINE: That 's nice . I got ta letter from my husband 's cousin in Abruzzi . His mother died .
MRS. PILLETTI: Oh .
CATHERINE: Do you remember Emilio DiGiorgio , owned the tavern in Abruzzi ?
MRS. PILLETTI: I do n't think I remember him .
CATHERINE: Well , he died . You know who else died ?
MRS. PILLETTI: Who ?
CATHERINE: You know the old man upstairs in this house . Old Irishman , always drunk . He got pleurisy . He was inna hospital two weeks . He died yesterday .
MRS. PILLETTI: Well , I always like to visit you , Catherine , because you always got such cheerful news .
THOMAS: Ma , you want something to eat , some tuna fish ?
MRS. PILLETTI: Hey , why do n't you go to the movie ? Your mother and me , we 're gon na be aby-sitter . Thomas looks indecisively at his wife .
VIRGINIA: Listen , let 's go downa Kaplans ' apartment . They told us to come down .
MRS. PILLETTI: Sure , sure . Thomas ponders a moment .
THOMAS: All right , Ma , we 're going downstairs to the Kaplans , if you want us fo anything .
CATHERINE: I wake up this morning , I hear the aby crying . So I wake up . I come in their room . That girl is shaking he hand atta baby . I said , `` You brute ! Do n't you strike that baby ! That 's my son 's baby ! ''
MRS. PILLETTI: It 's her baby too , you know .
CATHERINE: That 's my son Thomas 's baby .
MRS. PILLETTI: Well , it ai n't your baby .
CATHERINE: Did I tell you she threw the bottle- a milk at me ?
MRS. PILLETTI: You told me .
CATHERINE: She 's a witch , that one . I tell you what happen yesterday ?
MRS. PILLETTI: What happen ?
CATHERINE: She gave me the evil eye .
MRS. PILLETTI: Ufa !
CATHERINE: I keep one eye open when I sleep , ecause she 's gon na come in , stab me in my bed .
MRS. PILLETTI: Catherine , I want you come live in my house with Marty and me .
CATHERINE: Ah ?
MRS. PILLETTI: You son Thomas and Virginia , they come to my house this afternoon
CATHERINE: Who ?
MRS. PILLETTI: Your son Thomas and his wife Virginia
CATHERINE: When was this ?
MRS. PILLETTI: This afternoon , about four , five o'clock .
CATHERINE: What they say ?
MRS. PILLETTI: You know what they say . They say things are no good in this house . Catherine , your son is married . Leave him in peace . He wantsa be alone with his wife . They do n't want no old lady sitting inna balcony . Now I tell you what I think . I want you come live with me in my house with Marty and me . In my house , you have your own room . You do n't have to sleep onna couch inna living room like here . We will cook inna kitchen and talk like when we were girls . You are dear to me , and you are dea to Marty . We are pleased for you to come . Catherine surveys her sister coldly .
CATHERINE: My son Thomas came to see you this afternoon , and he said to you he wants to cast his mother from his house ?
MRS. PILLETTI: Catherine , do n't make an opera outta this . The three-a you anna baby live in three skinny rooms . You are an old goat , and she has an Italian temper . She is a good girl , but you drive her crazy . Catherine , you are no fool . You know this is no good , an old woman living with a husband and wife . Two women inna same kitchen , anna house burns down .
CATHERINE: So I am an old garbage bag , put inna street .
MRS. PILLETTI: Oh , Catherine , please ! Do n't make a tragedy . You come to my house where you know you be happier yourself .
CATHERINE: It pains that they should do this .
MRS. PILLETTI: I know it pains .
CATHERINE: These are the worst years , I tell you .
MRS. PILLETTI: Catherine , you are very dear to me . We have cried many times together . When my husband died , I would have gone insane if it were not for you . I ask you to come to my house , because I can make you happy . Please come to my house .
CATHERINE: These are the worst years . I tell you . It 's gon na happen to you . I 'm afraida look inna mirror . I 'm afraid I 'm gon na see an old lady with white hair , like the old ladies inna park , little bundles inna black shawl , waiting for the coffin . I 'm fifty- six years old . What am I to do with myself ? I have strength in my hands . I wan na cook . I wan na clean . I wan na make dinner for my children . Am I an old dog to lie in fronta the fire til my eyes close ? These are the terrible years , Theresa ! Terrible years !
MRS. PILLETTI: Catherine , my sister Catherine stares distraught at Mrs. Pilletti .
CATHERINE: It 's gon na happen to you ! It 's gon na happen to you ! What will you do if Marty gets married ? ! What will you cook ? What happen to alla children playing in alla rooms ? Where is the noise ? ! It is a curse to be a widow ! A curse . What will you do if Marty gets married ? ! What will you do ?
MARTY: You come up here often ?
CLARA: I was up here twice before . Once with a friend of mine and once I came up alone . The last time do you see that girl in the gray dress sitting over there ?
MARTY: Yeah .
CLARA: Well , the last time I was up here , that 's where I sat . I sat there fo an hour and a half , without moving a muscle . Now and then , some fellow would sort of walk up to me and then change his mind . I 'll never forget just sitting there for an hour and a half with my hands in my lap . Then I egan to cry , and I had to get up and go home .
MARTY: I cry a lot too . I 'm a big cryer .
CLARA: This is something recent with me , this bursting into tears at the least thing .
MARTY: Oh , I cry all the time , any little thing . My brothers , my brother-in- laws , they 're always telling me what a goodhearted guy I am . Well , you do n't get goodhearted by accident . You get kicked around long enough , you get to be a real professor of pain . I know exactly how you feel . And I also want you to know I 'm having a very good time with you now and eally enjoying myself . So you see , you 're not such a dog as you think you are .
CLARA: I 'm having a very good time , too .
MARTY: So there you are . So I guess I 'm not such a dog as I think I am .
CLARA: You 're a very nice guy , and I do n't know why some girl has n't grabbed you off long ago .
MARTY: I do n't know either . I think I 'm a very nice guy . I also think I 'm a pretty smart guy in my own way . Clara smiles briefly at this .
CLARA: I 'm twenty-nine years old . How old are you ?
MARTY: I 'm thirty-four .
CLARA: Benjamin Franklin High School .
MARTY: Benjamin Franklin , where 's that ? Brooklyn ? I went to Theodore Roosevelt ight up here on Fordham Road . It 's ight arounna corner from my house . I have a cousin who 's a teacher . He teaches Latin . He lives in Chicago . He was studying to be a Jesuit , but he gave it up after his first vows .
CLARA: Thank you .
MARTY: so I 'm inna kneeling position , and if you ever try shooting a BAR inna kneeling position , you know what I mean . I ca n't holda steady position . I 'm wavering back and forth
BUCKO: Anything good in there , Mac ?
ANGIE: A buncha dogs . He crosses to the Men 's Room .
MARTY: When I got outta the army , Clara , I was lost . I did n't know what I wanted to do . I was twenny-five years old , what was I gon na do , go back to my old job , forty cents an hour . I thought maybe I go to college unde the G.I . Biller Rights , you know ? But I would n't graduate till I was twenny-eight , twenny-nine years old , even if I made it in three years . And my brother Freddie wanted to get married , and I had three unmarried sisters in an Italian home , that 's a terrible thing . And my kid brothe Nickie , he 's a one got married last week . So I just went to pieces . I used to walk inna streets till three , four o'clock inna mornings . My mothe used to be so worried about me . My uncle Mario come over one time . He offered me a job driving his hack onna night shift . He got his own cab , you know . And God forgive me for what I 'm gon na say now , but I used to thinka doing away with myself . I used to stand sometimes in the subway , and God forgive me what I 'm going to say , I used to feel the tracks sucking me down under the wheels .
CLARA: Yes , I know .
MARTY: I 'm a Catholic , you know , and even to think about suicide is a terrible sin .
CLARA: Yes , I know .
MARTY: So then Mr. Gazzara he was a frienda my father he offered me this job in his butcher shop , and everybody pleaded with me to take it . So that 's what happened . I did n't wan na be a butcher .
CLARA: There 's nothing wrong with being a utcher .
MARTY: Well , I would n't call it an elegant profession . It 's in a lower social scale . People look down on butchers .
CLARA: I do n't .
MARTY: Well , the point is Mr. Gazzara wantsa sell his shop now , because he and his wife are lonely , and they wan na move out to California in Los Angeles and live near their married daughter . Because she 's always writing them to come out there . So it 's a nice little shop . I handle his books for him , so I know he has a thirty-five percent markup which is not unreasonable , and he takes home net maybe a hundred , hundred and fifty bucks a week . The point is , of course , you got ta worry about the supermarkets . There 's two inna neighborhood now , and there 's an A & P coming in , at least that 's the rumor . Of course , mosta his trade is strictly Italian , but the younge Italian girls , they get married , and they do n't stick to the old Italian dishes so much . I mean , you got ta take that into account too .
CLARA: It 's my feeling that you really want to buy this shop , Marty .
MARTY: That 's true . I do . But I 'm gon na have to take outta loan inna bank eight thousand dollars . That 's a big note to carry , because I have to give Mr. Gazzara a mortgage , and what I have to weigh is will it pay off in the end more than I can make onna salary ?
CLARA: Marty , I know you for three hours , ut I know you 're a good butcher . You 're an intelligent , sensitive , decent man . I have a feeling about you like sometimes a kid comes in to see me for one reason or another . And some of these kids , Marty , in my classes , they have so much warmth in them , so much capacity . And that 's the feeling I get about you .
MARTY: Well , there 's a lotta things I could do with this shop . I could organize my own supermarket . Get a buncha neighborhood merchants together . That 's what a lotta them are doing . He looks up at her now .
CLARA: I think anything you want to do , you 'll do well .
MARTY: I 'm Catholic . Are you Catholic ? Clara looks down at her hands .
CLARA: Yes , I am . Marty looks up at her .
MARTY: I only got about three bucks on me now , but I just live about eight locks from here on the other side of Webster Avenue . Why do n't we walk ack to my house ? I 'll run in , pick up some dough , and let 's step out somewhere .
CLARA: I really should get home
MARTY: It 's only a quarter of twelve . The clock 's right over there .
CLARA: I really should get home , I told my father Well , I suppose a little while longer . I wonder if there 's any place around here I could put some makeup on
MARTY: Hey , Mac !
PROPRIETOR: Inna back .
MARTY: Inna back .
ANGIE: Hey , Lou !
BARTENDER: What ?
ANGIE: Marty been in here the last coupla hours or so ?
BARTENDER: I ai n't seen Marty all night
ANGIE: Where is everybody ? I been walking around , I ca n't find anybody
CLARA: It 's really a fine opportunity for me . But I 'm not sure I want to e a department head . It 's mostly executive and administrative work . Well , anyway , I told you about my father , and he depends on me a great deal , and
MARTY: Why do n't you just move out to Portchester ?
CLARA: Well , that 's what I was saying . My father is getting old . And we 're very close . He 's a wonderful man , eally
MARTY: I think you 're kidding yourself , Clara . I used to think about moving out , you know ? And that 's what I used to say . `` My mother needs me . '' But when you really get down to it , that ai n't it at all . Actually , you need your father . You know what I mean ? You 're living at home , and you got your father and mother there , and you can go on like that being a little girl all your life .
CLARA: I 'm afraid of being lonely .
MARTY: Oh , you wo n't be so lonely . You 'll make friends right away .
CLARA: Actually , I do n't make friends easily .
MARTY: What 're you talking about ? You 're a eal likeable person . You 'll make friends out there in Portcheste one , two , three . You 'll have people visiting you alla time . I 'll come visit you . I 'll borrow my brothe Freddie 's car , or you can call me up when you feel blue , or I 'll call you up . And it 's gon na be nice . Do n't be so afraid .
RALPH'S VOICE: Hey , Marty ! Marty and Clara both look off
RALPH: Hey , Marty !
MARTY: Hello , Ralph .
RALPH: Hey , Marty , come over here a minute .
LEO: Who 's this ? Marty ?
RALPH: Yeah .

MARTY: Hiya .
LOUISE: What are we going to do , just sit around here all night ?
RALPH: Listen , Marty , these three squirrels are nurses . We 're all going ove Leo 's house later because there 's nobody there . These are the squirrels I told you about . Money inna bank , man . Wan na get inna car ? She 's a pretty nice-looking doll .
MARTY: I 'm with a girl , Ralph .
RALPH: Get ridda her . This is money inna ank .
MARTY: I ca n't do that , Ralph , because somebody already brushed her off once tonight .
RALPH: This is a good deal here , Marty .
MARTY: I ca n't do it , Ralph . Thanks anyway . Very nice to have met you all .
LOUISE: Come on , let 's get outta here .
LEO: Hey , Ralph , we might as well get going . Ralph bends forward and starts the car .
MARTY: I 'll see you , Leo .
LEO: I 'll see you , Marty .
MARTY: Wait a minute . Lem me find the light .
CLARA: Yes , I know .
MARTY: Come on inna dining room .
CLARA: No , thank you . I do n't think I should stay very long .
MARTY: Sure . Just take off your coat a minute .
CLARA: Oh , I 'm fine .
MARTY: You want me to take you home , I 'll take you home .
CLARA: Maybe that would be a good idea .
MARTY: I like you . I like you . I been telling you all night , I like you
CLARA: Marty
MARTY: I just wan na kiss , that 's all .
CLARA: No
MARTY: Please
CLARA: No
MARTY: Please
CLARA: Marty He releases her and turns away violently .
MARTY: All right ! I 'll take you home ! All ight !
CLARA: I just did n't feel like it , that 's all .
MARTY: I 'm old enough to know better . Comes New Year 's Eve , everybody starts arranging parties , I 'm the guy they got ta dig up a date for . Let me getta packa cigarettes , and I 'll take you home .
CLARA: I 'd like to see you again . Very much . The reason I did n't let you kiss me was because I just did n't know how to handle the situation . You 're the kindest man I ever met . The reason I tell you this is because I want to see you again very much . I know that when you take me home , I 'm going to just lie on my bed and think about you . I want very much to see you again . Marty stares down at his hands .
MARTY: Waddaya doing tomorrow night ?
CLARA: Nothing .
MARTY: I 'll call you up tomorrow morning . Maybe , we 'll go see a movie .
CLARA: I 'd like that very much .
MARTY: The reason I ca n't be definite about it now is my Aunt Catherine is probably coming over tomorrow , and I may have to help out .
CLARA: I 'll wait for your call .
MARTY: We better get started to your house , ecause the buses only run about one an hour now .
CLARA: All right . She stands .
MARTY: I 'll just get a packa cigarettes .
CLARA: Nothing .
MRS. PILLETTI: Hello , Marty , when you come home ?
MARTY: We just got here about fifteen minutes ago . Ma , I want you to meet Miss Clara Snyder . She 's graduate of New York University . She teaches chemistry in Benjamin Franklin High School . This seems to impress Mrs. Pilletti .
MRS. PILLETTI: Siddown , siddown . You want some chicken ? We got some chicken in the ice box .
CLARA: No , Mrs. Pilletti . We were just going home . Thank you very much anyway .
MRS. PILLETTI: Well , siddown a minute . I just come inna house . I 'll take off my coat . Siddown a minute . Mrs. Pilletti pulls her coat off .
MARTY: How 'd you come home , Ma ? Thomas give you a ride ?
MRS. PILLETTI: Oh , it 's a sad business . My sister , Catherine , she do n't get along with her daughter-in-law , so she 's gon na come live with us .
MARTY: Oh , she 's coming , eh , Ma ?
MRS. PILLETTI: Oh , sure . Siddown , siddown . Marty , tell he siddown .
MARTY: Might as well siddown a minute , Clara .
MRS. PILLETTI: Did you offer the young lady some fruit ?
MARTY: I offered her , Ma , she do n't want nothing .
CLARA: No , thank you , really , Mrs. Pilletti .
MRS. PILLETTI: It 's a very sad business , I tell you . A woman , fifty-six years old , all her life , she had her own home . Now she 's just an old lady , sleeping on her daughter-in-law 's couch . It 's a curse to be a mother , I tell you . Your children grow up and then what is left for you to do ? What is a mother 's life but her children ? It is a very cruel thing when your son has no place for you in his home .
CLARA: Could n't she find some sort of hobby to fill out her time ?
MRS. PILLETTI: Hobby ! What can she do ? She cooks and she cleans . You got ta have a house to clean . You got ta have children to cook for . These are the terrible years for a woman , the terrible years .
CLARA: You must n't feel too harshly against her daughter-in-law . She also wants to have a house to clean and a family to cook for .
MRS. PILLETTI: You do n't think my sister Catherine should live in her daughter-in-law 's house ?
CLARA: Well , I do n't know the people , of course , but as a rule , I do n't think a mother-in-law should live with a young couple .
MRS. PILLETTI: Where do you think a mother-in-law should go ?
CLARA: I do n't think a mother should depend so much upon her children for he ewards in life .
MRS. PILLETTI: Well , maybe that 's what they teach you in New York University . In real life , it do n't work out that way . You wait till you are a mother .
CLARA: It 's silly of me to argue about it . I do n't know the people involved .
MARTY: Ma , I 'm gon na take her home now . It 's getting late , and the buses only run about one an hour .

VIRGINIA: Oh shaddup , will you do me a favor ? Marty comes up to them , holding the baby .
MARTY: So Thomas , he does about twelve , thirteen hundred gross . Rent 's a hundred and two . The problem , of course , is the supermarkets . That 's what I wan na ask you . If I get together with a coupla othe merchants , make our own supermarket
THOMAS: What about the time she wanted to make an old-fashioned Italian dinne for my brother , but you would n't let her ! ?
VIRGINIA: Waddaya talking about ? ! !

MARTY: So Tommy
VIRGINIA: Waddaya want me to do , go out and uy a whole new setta pots and pans ? !
MARTY: Tommy , gim me a coupla minutes , because I promised Mr. Gazzara I 'd let him know tomorrow . See , what I wan na know , Tom , if a buncha individual etail merchants get together , how does it operate ? On individual mark- ups ? You know what I mean ? Say I 'm the butcher and Aldo Capelli , he 's the dairyman and grocer , so suppose I mark up thirty-five percent , but he works on forty , so
THOMAS: Waddaya talking about , do you know what you 're talking about ?
MARTY: No , I do n't know . That 's why I 'm asking you .
THOMAS: Take the baby , will you ? !
MARTY: Well , you see , Thomas I figure the ig problem is the supermarkets . But Patsy 's shop , that 's a specialized trade . The supermarkets do n't carry Italian meat .
THOMAS: Who buys Italian meat anymore ? You think my wife buys Italian meat ? She goes to the A & P , picks up some lamb chops wrapped in cellophane , opens up a canna peas , and that 's dinner , boy .
VIRGINIA: Sure , all you wan na eat is that greasy stuff your mother makes .
MARTY: Well , I understand the problem about the supermarkets , but I was talking to this girl last night , and she made the point that a likeable personality is a valuable business asset .
THOMAS: Marty , see that my mother is nice and comfortable , eh ?
MARTY: Sure . This girl said
THOMAS: What girl , what does she know ? Why do n't you let her hold the baby once in a while ? ! Your mother , boy , she wantsa take the kid for a day , that 's fine !

CATHERINE: Were the lights on ?
MRS. PILLETTI: Oh sure . This girl is a college graduate .
CATHERINE: They 're the worst . College girls are one step from the streets . They smoke like men inna saloon . My son Joseph , his wife , you know , she types onna typewriter . One step from the streets , I tell you . Mrs. Pilletti ponders this philosophy for a moment .
MRS. PILLETTI: That 's the first time Marty eve ought a girl to this house . She seems like a nice girl . I think he has a feeling for this girl . You heard him sing . He been singing like that all morning . Catherine nods bleakly .
CATHERINE: Well , that 's all . You will see . Today , tomorrow , inna week , he 's gon na say to you , `` Hey , Ma , it 's no good being a single man . I 'm tired-a running around . '' Then he 's gon na say , `` Hey , Ma , wadda we need this old house ? Why do n't we sell this old house , move into a nicer parta town ? A nice little apartment ? ''
MRS. PILLETTI: I do n't sell this house , I tell you that . This is my husband 's house . I had six children in this house .
CATHERINE: You will see . A coupla months , you gon na be an old lady , sleeping onna couch in her daughter-in-law 's house .

MRS. PILLETTI: Sure .
MARTY: Boy , this place is really coming to pieces . You know , Ma , I think we oughta sell this place . The whole joint 's going to pieces . The plumbing is rusty . Everything .

MRS. PILLETTI: She 's more than twenty-nine years old , Marty . That 's what she tells you .
MARTY: What , Ma ?
MRS. PILLETTI: She looks thirty-five , forty . She did n't look Italian to me . Marty frowns but remains silent .
MARTY: I do n't know . I do n't think so .
MRS. PILLETTI: She do n't look Italian to me . What kinda family she come from ? There was something about her I did n't like . It seems funny , the first time you meet her , she comes to your empty house alone . These college girls , they all one step fromma streets .
MARTY: What are you talking about ? She 's a nice girl .
MRS. PILLETTI: She did n't look Italian to me . A silence hangs between them .
MARTY: You do n't like her . You only met he for two minutes .
MRS. PILLETTI: Do n't bring her to the house no more .

RALPH: Oh man , you shoulda come with us last night , Marty . That one for you was a real lunatic . How 'd you make out ?
MARTY: Oh , I hadda nice timeI did n't try nothing . She 's a nice girl . I just met her last night , you know . I just talked with her . I did n't even try nothing
JOE: so the whole book winds up , Mike Hammer , he 's inna room there with this doll . So he says , `` You rat , you are the murderer . '' So she begins to con him , you know ? She tells him how she loves him . And then Bam ! He shoots her in the stomach . So she 's laying there , gasping for breath , and she says , `` How could you do that ? '' And he says , `` It was easy . ''
LEO: Boy , that Mickey Spillane , boy he can write .
MARTY: We got ta whole pot inna kitchen . We give you a plate-a your own .
ANGIE: Oh , I could n't eat nothing . My mothe just stuffed me right up to the jaws .
JOE: What I like about Mickey Spillane is he knows how to handle women . In one ook , he picks up a tomato who gets hit with a car , and she throws a pass at him . And then he meets two eautiful twins , and they throw passes at him . And then he meets some eautiful society leader , and she throws a pass at him , and
LEO: Boy , that Mickey Spillane , he sure can write .

ANGIE: Marty , let 's go downna Seventy-Second Street area tonight .
MARTY: I do n't feel like going , Angie . I thought I 'd take this girl to a movie .
ANGIE: Boy , you really musta made out good last night .
MARTY: We just talked .
ANGIE: Boy , she musta been some talker . She musta been about fifty years old .
JOE: I always figure a guy oughta marry a girl who 's twenny years younger than he is so that when he 's forty , his wife is a real nice-looking doll .
LEO: That means he 'd have to marry the girl when she was one year old .
JOE: I never thoughta that .
MARTY: I did n't think she was so bad-looking .
ANGIE: She musta kept you inna shadows all night .
RALPH: Marty , you do n't wan na hang around with dogs . It gives you a bad eputation .
ANGIE: Let 's go downa Seventy-Second Street .
MARTY: I told this dog I was gon na call he today about two-thirty .
ANGIE: Brush her . Listen , you wan na come with me tonight , or you wan na go with this dog ?

ANGIE: I looked all over for you last night , you know that ?
JOE: Another book that I read by Mickey Spillane , I ca n't remember the name of it , but it was about this red- headed tramp he finds inna street , and he gives her some dough , because he 's sorry for her Wait a minute , I think that 's the same book I was telling you about before
MARTY: You did n't like her at all ?
ANGIE: A nothing . A real nothing .
JOE'S VOICE: You know something ?
MRS. PILLETTI: So what are you gon na do tonight , Marty ?
MARTY: I do n't know , Ma . I 'm all knocked out . I think I 'll just hang arounna house and watch
LEO: What time is it ?
JOE: About eight o'clock .
ANGIE: You do n't feel like going downna Seventy-Second Street ?

JOE: What 's playing on Fordham Road ? I think there 's a good picture in the Loew 's Paradise .
GEORGE: You guys feel like working up a game- a cards ?
ANGIE: Come on , let 's go down Seventy-Second Street , walk around . We 're sure to wind up with something .
JOE'S VOICE: I 'll never forgive LaGuardia fo cutting out burlesque outta New York City
GEORGE'S VOICE: There 's a burlesque in Union City . Let 's go over to Union City
ANGIE'S VOICE: Yeah , you 're the one who do n't even wan na take a ride onna subway fo half an hour . Now , you wan na go alla way over to Union City

STANLEY: A dream It was only a dream .
LT. KELLAWAY: Nice PJ 's pal .
STANLEY: Can I help you ?
LT. KELLAWAY: You 're Ipkiss ? Stanley Ipkiss ?
STANLEY: That 's right .
LT. KELLAWAY: Some kind of prowler broke in and attacked Mrs. Peenman .
STANLEY: Really ? I did n't hear a thing .
LT. KELLAWAY: Then you must be a pretty sound sleeper , Ipkiss 'cause she unloaded a couple rounds of 20 ott buckshot five feet from you door .
STANLEY: That 's impossible !
LT. KELLAWAY: Excuse me ?
STANLEY: That 's a , possible . See , I have this inner ear problem . Sometimes I ca n't hear a thing .
KELLAWAY: Is that a fact ?
STANLEY: What ?
KELLAWAY: Forget it .
STANLEY: Sure thanks .
KELLAWAY: Look , Mrs. Peenman , you got ta admit your description is pretty tough to swallow .
MRS. PEENMAN: Then you can choke on it for all I care . I saw what I saw .
KELLAWAY: Right . A green head the size of a pumpkin , purple zoot suit and spats . That 's a pretty serious fashion risk for any self-respecting second story man .
OFFICER: Lt. , we just got an emergency call from a mechanic on 67th Street .
KELLAWAY: What ?
POLICEMAN: Some kind of assault and battery . Sound pretty bad .
KELLAWAY: Alright . Dont ' worry Mrs. Peenman , we 'll find this guy fo you . Officer Deluca here has a few forms you 'll have to fill out .
STANLEY: Milo ! Keys ! Keys !
PARAMEDIC #3: I want a proctologist standing y ! Yeah , you heard me ! The best one you can find .
OFFICER: We were able to get a description Lt. , but it 's pretty weird .
KELLAWAY: Let me guess Big green head . Zoot suit .
OFFICER: How did you
KELLWAY: Whoever this guy is , he 's a world class twisto .
PEGGY: Excuse me , Lt. , I 'm with the Evening Star . Can you tell me what happened here ?
KELLAWAY: Sorry . Too early to comment .
PEGGY: It looks like some kind of mo scare tactic .
KELLAWAY: I said no comment . Now break it up . This is a crime scene .
CHARLIE: What happened to you last night ? The girls and I were looking all over for you .
STANLEY: I uh , did n't feel so good . I decided to go home early .
CHARLIE: As a matter of fact , you do n't look so good . You got to take etter care of yourself , man .
STANLEY: How was the club ?
CHARLIE: Are you kidding ? It was hotte than a pistol . Did you see the paper ?
STANLEY: No .
CHARLIE: Your girlfriend got a great eview .
HEADLINE: `` Bombshell Explodes at Monnkey 's Paw . ''
DICKEY: Ipkiss ! You 're forty minutes late ! Every time you do that you 're robbing this bank of its time and money !
STANLEY: Sorry , Mr. Dicky . It wo n't happen again .
DICKEY: If you were n't so busy ogling girlie pictures you 'd get some work done around here .
CHARLIE: Ah She 's a prospective client of Stanley 's , sir .
DICKEY: She is ? Well Next time she comes in see that you send he directly to my office .
STANLEY: Yes sir , Mr. Dickey .
CHARLIE: Look at that little creep . If it was n't for his daddy he 'd be out somewhere shakin ' down school kids for lunch money .
STANLEY: You think she ever will come back , Charlie ?
CHARLIE: Who knows ? Forget about her , Stanley . A dame like that is always looking for the B.B.D . The bigger better deal . Ask he what her sign is and she 'll say dollar .
STANLEY: You do n't know that . She 's an artist . Maybe she 's sensitive .
CHARLIE: Yeah . She can sense a guy 's credit line at two hundred yards . Stanley , you need a girl you can depend on . Someone a little more down to earth someone like
PEGGY: Excuse me , can you tell me where I can find Stanley Ipkiss ?
CHARLIE: Like her ! Someone like her . As a matter of fact I could use someone like her myself . Hel-lo there . May I be of some assistance ?
PEGGY: Stanley Ipkiss ?
STANLEY: Oh , hi . I already have a subscription , thanks .
PEGGY: Oh no , actually I just wanted to ask you a few questions .
STANLEY: Really ? About what ?
PEGGY: Ripley Auto Finishing . You 're a customer of theirs are n't you ?
STANLEY: I uh . No . I think you must have made a mistake .
PEGGY: Is n't this a form of theirs you filled out ?
STANLEY: Oh , that Ripley Auto . I guess I have stopped in there once o twice , Miss what did you say your name was ?
PEGGY: Peggy Brandt .
STANLEY: Wait a minute Peggy Brandt of `` Ask Peggy '' ?
PEGGY: That 's right .
STANLEY: You printed my letter last year , emember ? `` Nice Guys Finish Last . ''
PEGGY: You 're Mr. Nice Guy ? Stanley do you realize how much mail we got about that letter ? There 's hundreds of women out there who are looking for a man just like you .
STANLEY: Are you serious ?
PEGGY: Of course . DO you know how hard it is to find a decent man in this town ? Most of them think monogamy is some kind of wood .
STANLEY: Why are you covering this story ?
PEGGY: They cut my salary . I just ca n't make it by on `` Dear Peggy '' anymore . The truth is , I want to be a real reporter and if I can break this story I know they 'll let me . Look Stanley , I know Ripley Auto is a crooked operation . They may even have had ties to the Mob . I 'm not out to get you . I just want the truth .
STANLEY: I wish I knew the truth , Peggy . I really do .
DISAPPEARS: inside .
DORIAN: Good afternoon , Councilman Snell . Nice of you to drop by .
SNELL: Cut the crap . Dorian . What 's so important that I had to come here in person ?
DORIAN: I got a little job for you , Tom . I want you to pull the Swede 's gambling license .
SNELL: That 's impossible . He was approved six months ago .
DORIAN: Pull a few strings . Find something in the fine print . I do n't care how you do it , but do it . You owe me .
SNELL: I owe you nothing , you little piece of shit . I got you liquor license when nobody else would touch
DORIAN: That 's pretty . What is that , a carnation ?
SNELL: No please . I can do it . I can make it happen .
DORIAN: That 's smart . You 're a very smart man . Now pull yourself together . Look at you .
TINA: Or it could be two lovers . That would be the woman on top , of course
CHARLIE: Forget her , Stanley . Ask her what her sign is and she 'll say dollar .
DICKEY: Every time you 're late Ipkiss , you 're robbing this bank !
DR. NEUMAN: We must repress our Id ou deepest darkest desires .
TINA: Hey , are you okay .

MASK: Ak you got me Pahdnuh .
COUGH: Tell Auntie Em to let Old Yelle out . Tell Tint Tim I wo n't be makin ' it home for Christmas .
THEIR: guns drawn .
KELLAWAY: Drop it , Tyrel !
DORIAN: Hello , Kellaway . You got a warrant or did you just drop by for a night cap ?
KELLAWAY: I got probable cause . A couple of your boys were spotted knocking over Edge City Bank .
DORIAN: Easy , junior . You 're givin ' me a woodey .
KELLWAY: One of them was wearin ' some kind of big green mask .
DORIAN: For once you 're on the right track , but that 's not one of my men . Maybe you ought to try a little actual police work instead of this harassment bullshit .
KELLAWAY: This is n't harassment . You want to see some harassment ? Search the place , boys .
DORIAN: Ever wonder why you did n't make Captain , asshole ? I got friends so high up they 'd give you a nose leed .
KELLAWAY: Well what d'ya know ? I guess they gave you one too .
DORIAN: You 're a dead man .
OFFICER: Lt. , we got a stiff upstairs . One of the guys from the heist .
KELLAWAY: Better call that high-priced lawyer of yours , Tyrel . You 're comin ' downtown .
DORIAN: I 'll be back on the streets before sunrise and you know it .
KELLAWAY: Then just think of this as the city 's way of showing you a little hospitality . I 'll stop by to tuck you in myself .
KELLAWAY: You 're on your own , boys .
COP: Do n't worry , Lt . If he 's in there , well get him .
KELLAWAY: And if he 's not , I got a feeling I know where to find him .
STANLEY: Oh my god !
LT. KELLAWAY: You can answer a few questions .
STANLEY: I 've got to get ready for work .
LT. KELLAWAY: Trust me . Your bank 's opening late today .
STANLEY: Here mostly . Is something wrong ?
LT. KELLAWAY: Maybe , yes . Maybe , no . Maybe it 's all just a crazy coincidence that this so called `` Mask '' character always seems to be wherever you are .
STANLEY: Mask who ?
LT. KELLAWAY: Do n't insult my intelligence , Ipkiss . First , he 's spotted in your building , then the bank where you work and now I find this at the Monkey 's Paw .
STANLEY: Milo . No ! Okay , so I went out on the town last night . A guy 's got to have a little fun .
LT. KELLAWAY: In your jammies ?
STANLEY: Naw , I just took 'em with me in case I did n't make it home . I do n't know about you , Lieutenant . But I 've got a pretty good track ecord with the ladies .
LT. KELLAWAY: Wait a second you smell that ?
STANLEY: What ?
KELLAWAY: Bullshit . I hate the smell of ullshit . Do n't even think about leaving town , Ipkiss . I 'll be in touch .
STANLEY: What are we gon na do , Milo ? What are we gon na do ?
DEPUTY OLIVERAS: I do n't know , boss . That 's one helluva rubber mask .
LT. KELLAWAY: Where 's the lab report ?
DEPUTY OLIVERAS: We got fingerprints on some of the currency , but nothing matches Tyrel 's men . Looks like this guy eat 'em to the punch .
LT. KELLAWAY: Get the bank 's employee files and un down the prints on a guy named Ipkiss .
DEPUTY OLIVERAS: You figure it was an inside job ?
LT. KELLAWAY: Yeah , and all I need is a couple of prints to lock this wack jo up 'till doomsday .
DORIAN: A fifty thousand dollar reward to the man who finds this `` Mask '' character before the cops do . Get the word out to every street hustler and low life in this town . I want him here . In my office . Alive . By tomorrow ! Now get going !
TINA: You . You 're losing it Dorian .
DORIAN: I 'm losing nothing . Except maybe some extra baggage I do n't need around here .
TINA: What 's that supposed to mean ?
DORIAN: You were n't putting up much of a fight when that green goon kissed you last night .
TINA: C'mon , did it look to you like I had a choice ?
DORIAN: Maybe you did and maybe you did n't , but I know this , one day eal soon I 'm gon na run this town and when I do there 's gon na be payback for anyone who crossed me . I mean anyone .
MR. DICKEY: Ipkiss ! We have a crisis on ou hands here and you stroll in ove an hour late . If I have to put up with your slovenly
STANLEY: Back off Monkey-Boy , before I tell your daddy how you 're running this anch like it 's your own personal piggy bank ! If the I.R.S . saw some of those files we could arrange a little vacation for you at Club Fed !
MR. DICKEY: That will be all , Ipkiss .
CHARLIE: Woah ! What side of who 's bed did you wake up on ?
STANLEY: I 'm not sure .
TWITCHES: I have n't exactly been myself lately .
CHARLIE: Yeah , well you look like you could use a little R and R there uddy and as a matter of fact I 've got just the ticket . O should I say tickets ?
STANLEY: I 'm afraid to ask .
CHARLIE: Saturday night . Grand opening of the Valhalla Casino . Serious skirt alert . Everybody who 's anybody will be there . What do you say ?
STANELY: I do n't know Charlie , I
STANLEY: Tina What are you doing here ?
TINA: I heard about the robbery . I guess I just wanted to make sure you were okay .
STANLEY: Oh , do n't worry about me .
TWITCHES: I 'm fine .
TINA: Are you sure ? You look a little
STANLEY: I 'm just having a little trouble sleeping is all .
BEAT: I guess you wo n't want to open that account after all this
TINA: I 'm not so sure I 'll have much to open an account with anymore .
STANLEY: What about the nightclub ? I thought you were doing great .
TINA: I do n't know how much longer I can stay there Stanley . Things are getting a little intense .
STANLEY: Well , there must be plenty of other places you could sing . Maybe even get a record deal
TINA: I wish it was that easy . There 's thousands of girls out there just like me who
STANLEY: Not just like you . You 've got a voice like like an angel .
TINA: An angel huh ? That 's the first time I 've heard that one .
STANLEY: No , I mean it . You really do .
TINA: I can vamp my way through a tune . But that 's not really singing .
STANLEY: What is it with you , Tina ? Why do n't you believe in yourself ?
TINA: I guess I 've just heard a lot of promises from a lot of guys . In the end they all wanted the same thing and it was n't a song .
STANLEY: So maybe you 've been singing fo the wrong guys .
TINA: I 'm not so sure there 's any othe kind . Not for me , anyway .
RISES: Well , I 'm glad nobody got hurt .
STANLEY: Yeah .
TINA: What about this guy , the Mask ? Do the cops have a line on him ?
STANLEY: I 'm not sure . Why are you interested ?
TINA: Promise you wo n't say anything ?
STANLEY: Sure .
TINA: He came to the club last night and he was just so well , different . I have n't been able to get him off my mind .
STANLEY: Really ? They say he 's pretty weird looking .
TINA: Yeah . He 's ugly but he 's kinda cool y'know , like Mick Jagger .
STANLEY: You really think so ?
TINA: Yeah . If you hear anything about him , would you call me at the club ?
STANLEY: Actually I sort of know the guy .
TINA: What ?
STANLEY: The Mask . We 're - old college uddies him and I .
TINA: Are you serious ?
STANLEY: Oh yeah . To tell you the truth , I 'm sorta covering for him on this ank thing . He 's not such a bad guy , really . He just gets a little carried away .
TINA: I 'll say . Do you think you could give him a message ?
STANLEY: I suppose so .
TINA: Tell him I want to see him again
STANLEY: When ? I mean , I 'd need to tell him exactly .
TINA: How about seven o'clock tonight at Peninsula Park .
STANLEY: I 'll be I mean , I 'll make sure he 's there .
LANDLORD: Sorry , doll . I had the locks changed this afternoon .
PEGGY: You what ? You ca n't do that !
LANDLORD: You 've known we 're going condo for six months , Peggy . I ca n't stall the owner a minute longer . Either you pony up the downpayment or you 're out .
PEGGY: Just a couple more days , Phil . The paper 's ready to give me a full time job .
LANDLORD: I 've heard that one before .
PEGGY: C'mon , at least let me get a few of my things .
LANDLORD: Do n't make me regret this . We get a certified check by noon tomorrow or a Sheriff will escort you out of here .
PEGGY: Thanks Phil . You 're a sweetheart .
PEGGY: Who Who are you ?
THE FIGURE: Just a guy with a little information lookin ' to make a uck . But maybe I heard wrong . You do n't look like much of a eporter to me .
PEGGY: You give me something worth printing and I 'll get you you money . What 's this about ?
FIGURE: The guy they call the Mask and why Dorian Tyrel 's willing to pay fifty large to get him .
PEGGY: How do I find this Tyrel ?
FIGURE: Careful , sweet meat . You break this story and he just might find you .
SWEDE: Dorian thanks for coming by , kid .
DORIAN: My pleasure , Swede . It 's been too long . I was worried you were still pissed about that little thing with Harry the Hat .
SWEDE: That ? It was nothing . He was a pain in my ass anyway . Here , sit down , sit down .
DORIAN: Congratulations on the new casino .
SWEDE: Thanks , but it might be a little early to celebrate . As a matter of fact that 's why I asked you to stop by .
DORIAN: Is that right ?
SWEDE: Here have a little something to eat . That 's Svenska meatballs , kid . The real thing .
DORIAN: Thanks .
SWEDE: So , I tell you Dorian , it 's a terrible shame . I put all my hard work into this beautiful casino and what do you think ? All the sudden I got all kinda problems with the city . Big problems . The whole deal could fold .
DORIAN: Maybe I can help you out . I 'm expecting to come into a little investment capital shortly . If worse comes to worse and you eally need to bail out
SWEDE: What a sweet guy . Is n't this guy a sweetheart ? Thanks for the offer Dorian , but I think maybe I can solve this myself .
DORIAN: Is that right ?
SWEDE: That 's right . You know that Councilman you got in your pocket ?
DORIAN: Sure , Swede . Take it easy .
SWEDE: Good . Now get out of my sight .
DR. NEUMAN: This is extremely unusual , Mr. Ipkiss . Barging in without an appointment or
STANLEY: Look , you 're the big expert on masks , right ? Well , I 've got an emergency here !
DR. NEUMAN: Try to calm yourself . Now this woman you were telling me about , I 'm not sure I understand the problem .
STANELY: I 've got a date with the girl of my dreams , only she does n't know it 's me
DR. NEUMAN: Very interesting looks like tenth or eleventh century Scandinavian . Where did you get this ?
STANLEY: I found it or it found me . I 'm not sure . The problem is it 's uining my life !
DR. NEUMAN: So you believe this actually changes you into a different person ?
STANLEY: Yes ! It 's turning me into some kind of lunatic !
DR. NEUMAN: Mr. Ipkiss , please . This is just obsessional dellusion . What you have here is nothing more than a piece of wood .
STANELY: But your book says masks
DR. NEUMAN: My book uses masks as a metapho for our complex personalities . The masks we must present to the outside world to suppress the id . To protect our innermost desires .
STANELY: Yeah , well this one works in everse .
DR. NEUMAN: You 're going to have to be willing to work on this delusion or
STANLEY: It 's not a delusion ! Alright , I 'll prove it to you if I have to , but I wo n't be responsible for the consequences .
DR. NEUMAN: Mr. Ipkiss please ! There is no such thing as a magical mask .
STANLEY: Last chance to hide all dangerous objects .
DR. NEUMAN: Alright then , go on . You 're not going to frighten me .
STANLEY: Whooooooooaaaaa
DR. NEUMAN: Whoa , what ?
STANLEY: It did n't work ?
DR. NEUMAN: Does that surprise you ? The mask is nothing but a reflection of you - the inner you .
STANLEY: It worked last night . And the night before . Maybe it only works at night What kind of mask did you say this was .
DR. NEUMAN: Scandinavian . It looks like a epresentation of Loki , the Norse God of Mischief . He supposedly caused so much trouble that Odin anished him from Valhalla forever .
STANLEY: What if he banished him into a mask ?
DR. NEUMAN: I 'm sorry , Mr. Ipkiss , we 're out of time .
STANLEY: But what should I do about my date ?
DR. NEUMAN: Your date ?
STANLEY: You know . Tonight . The park . Tina . Do I go as myself of the Mask ?
DR. NEUMAN: Mr. Ipkiss , please . Have n't you een listening to anything I 've een saying ? Go as yourself . And as the Mask . Because they are the one and the same , eautiful person
LT. KELLAWAY: Yeah ?
LT. KELLAWAY: Do n't do a thing until I tell you . Just keep the SWAT team standing y . If this guy 's half as bad as he 's supposed to be we 'll need all the help we can get .
TINA: Stanley , what are you doing here ?
STANLEY: Oh , Tina Hi . You 're early .
TINA: A little .
STANLEY: I just wanted to make sure you two got together okay .
TINA: That 's nice . You know , I hardly ever stop by here . It 's hard to believe it was just a garbage heap .
STANLEY: It 's always beautiful at sunset . Those methane emissions really pick up the colors .
TINA: Wow . They really do . All those pinks and greens .
STANLEY: Well I 'm sure my cousin will e along any minute . He neve shows up anywhere 'till afte sundown . He 's sort of strange that way .
RISES: I guess I 'll get going .
TINA: No , Stanley . Stay for a second . I was thinking about what you said and I , uh , I want you to know I appreciate it . Maybe you 're ight . If I believed in myself a little more I would n't rely on guys like Dorian .
STANLEY: Dorian You mean Dorian Tyrel ?
TINA: Yeah . He 's sort of my manager .
STANLEY: Tina , you 've got to be careful of that guy . He 's a dangerous criminal .
TINA: You really mean that , do n't you ?
STANLEY: Absolutely . You ought to hea the stories
TINA: No , I mean , you 're really worried about me . That 's real sweet , Stanley .
STANLEY: C'mon , Tina this is serious . How involved are you with this guy ?
TINA: I can take care of myself , Stanley . I always have .
STANLEY: Oh , really ? People close to Tyrel have a nasty habit of turning up dead , or have n't you noticed ?
TINA: Look , this may sound a little cold ut I do what I have to do to get y , okay ? I 'm nobody in this town without Dorian .
STANLEY: And who are you with him Tina ? I 'm not exactly sure who I am anymore but at least I 'm trying to find out . If you really had any faith in yourself , you would n't be hanging on to some kind of free ride .
SIGHS: I 'm sorry Tina . I guess I bette get going .

Whatever this mask is , you do n't need it . You Stanley Ipkiss , are already all you ever need to e .
STANLEY: Gosh , Peggy . Do you really mean that ?

LT. KELLAWAY: I 'm history . The Captain 's going to have my badge for breakfast . With a little pension on top .
DOYLE: C'mon Lieutenant , it was n't you fault . Something will turn up .
LT. KELLAWAY: Sure . Stanley Ipkiss is going to fall right into my lap
HIS: lap -
LT. KELLAWAY: Ipkiss !
STANLEY: I can explain everything
DOYLE: Do n't bother .
LT. KELLAWAY: You have the right to remain silent , you freakin ' Looney Tune . Anymore of your half-baked wisecracks can and will be used against you by me , personally
STANLEY: You 've got to listen to me !
GUARD: Wake up . You got ta visitor .
STANLEY: About time you found me a lawyer Tina ?
TINA: Hello , Stanley .
STANLEY: What 's wrong ? Your boyfriend kick you out for not delivering me on schedule ?
TINA: Is that what you think - that I set you up ?
STANLEY: I do n't know . But I 've got plenty of time to figure it out .
TINA: You 're just going to have to trust me on this .
STANLEY: Now is not the best time fo me on trusting women .
TINA: I ran out on Dorian last night , Stanley . I just came to tell you I 'm sorry . Sorry about everything .
STANLEY: You ran out on him ?
TINA: That magic mask of yours turned him into some kind of monster
STANLEY: He was n't exactly Mother Theresa in the first place .
TINA: He 's going to the casino opening tonight and he 's planning to do something terrible .
STANLEY: A real change of pace for him .
TINA: Half this town will be there Stanley . I tried to tell the cops , but they would n't listen to me .
STANLEY: As long as he 's got the mask , there 's nothing they can do to stop him anyway . There 's nothing anyone can do .
TINA: There must be some way . How does it work ?
STANLEY: It 's like it brings you innermost desires to life . If deep down inside you 're a little repressed and a hopeless romantic , you ecome sort of a love-crazy wild man .
TINA: And if you 've got a black heart ?
STANLEY: Then the world 's going to be a very dark place . And if I were you , I 'd get out of town . Fast .
TINA: Thanks .
STANLEY: For what ?
TINA: Lots of things . For really elieving in me when I could n't . For sharing a sunset with me . For being the first guy to treat me like I was a person instead of a slab of meat . And for being any kind of omantic . Even a hopeless one .
STANLEY: You 're welcome .
TINA: You know , that night at the clu I knew I met someone special . Someone like nobody I 'd ever met efore .
STANLEY: The Mask .
TINA: No the guy that was inside the Mask all the time . You . Stanley Ip -
STANLEY: Hey ! A girl 's being kidnapped out there ! Do something !
DORIAN: Baby , there you are I was gettin ' all worried about you .
TINA: I just went out for a little while Dorian .
DORIAN: Looks like maybe a long little while , right baby ?
TINA: No
DORIAN: Nobody else does either . Nobody ever will .
STANLEY: peers down the hall and sees
THE: key-chain . He starts to pull when
STANLEY: Atta boy , Milo . Now let 's see if we can get out of here .
CROWD: applaudes and flashbulbs POP .
THE SWEDE: So , ladies and gentlemen with a special thanks to Mayor Tilton and everyone else who made this possible , I give you the Valhalla Casino .
DORIAN: It 's almost time .
DOWN: on his chair unconscious .
STANLEY: Come on .
KELLAWAY: Ipkiss !
STANLEY: Hold it ! I warn you ! I 'm seriously stressed out here !
KELLAWAY: Easy , Ipkiss . Do n't be an idiot . You 're in the middle of a police station . There 's no way you 're just going to walk out of here .
STANLEY: You 're right .
KELLAWAY: Now what are you doing ?
STANLEY: Putting myself in your custody .
KELLAWAY: You are certifiable .
STANLEY: Milo !
KELLAWAY: Of course . We would n't want to keep Alice and the white rabbit waiting .
STANLEY: Now move .
DOYLE: Hi Lieutenant . Where are you taking Ipkiss ?
KELLAWAY: Ixnay ! Ehay 's otgay an ungay ouch !
DOYLE: What did you say ?
CHARLIE: Hello tall , Nordic and beautiful . One look at you and I know how your hat feels .
MRS. PEENMAN: Out of my way , Buster . Mama feels lucky tonight .
KELLAWAY: Ipkiss , I 'll have you locked up for this so long sex will be safe again !
ORLANDO: We scored over half a mil from the safe !
TINA: Let me go you bastard !
SWEET EDDY: All set boss .
STANLEY: Okay . When I push the red button the safety is off , right ?
KELLAWAY: I 'm not helping you , Ipkiss .
STANLEY: Alright , suit yourself . You stay and be a good boy .
TILTON: Hey , watch it ! Oh , Arnie
THUG: Whoaaaaa !
CHARLIE: Stanley ! What are you doing here ?
STANLEY: Start sneaking people out the ack . Watch out for the oil .
SWEDE: Let me offa this thing , you lousy scumbag !
TINA: Stanley !
STANLEY: Hang on , Tina .
TINA: Stanley , look out !
BREATHY: Nobody ever kissed me like Dorian Tyrel .
ORLANDO: No time , boss . This building 's going down any minute
DORIAN: to give the girl one last thrill .
DORIAN: C'mere , you ugly little mutt
SWEET EDDY: Get him off me !
ORLANDO: C'mon ! We 've got the money . Let 's get the hell out of here !
DORIAN: I got ta have that mask !
TINA: You did it
STANLEY: Milo ! Milo , come !
TINA: Stanley we made it . We 're alive !
DORIAN: I 'll take that .
STANLEY: Hold it right there or you 'll be looking for this on the bottom of the harbor .
DORIAN: Drop it and I 'll kill you all .
STANLEY: You can have it . But she gets to go .
DORIAN: Fine .
TINA: Go where ?
STANLEY: Swimming . We 're still close to shore .
DORIAN: Five seconds , Ipkiss .
STANLEY: Go ahead . Hurry
DORIAN: Okay . Put it down . Right ove there .
TINA: Stanley ! The dynamite !
STANLEY: Back to jail , Lieutenant ?
LT. KELLAWAY: Ipkiss , I 'd like to lock you up for the rest of my life . But the mayor and a hundred other witnesses say Dorian Tyrel 's the bad guy and you 're the good guy . So no jail . Just a downtown parade at noon .
RESIGNED: And I 've got to be your escort .
STATUESQUE: Valkyrie change girl .
CHARLIE: So I deck this thug , grab his gun and tell Stanley , `` Take cover , Buddy . I 'll get these folks out sae and sound . '' Y'know we should go back to my place so I can tell you the rest of the story .
MRS. PEENMAN: Just look at this mess
CHARLIE: So what do you say , sweetheart ? Let 's you and me go back to my place and scramble some eggs .
CHARLIE: Yah ! Put me down !
JACK: Thankee Killick
BLAKENEY: In
CALAMY: Out .
BLAKENEY: In . It was here . The line is in .
CALAMY: It was there . It was out . Out
BLAKENEY: In . Tell him Boyle . It was in I say .
HOLLAR: Lights out !
CREWMEN: Watch there ! Watch
WATCH CAPTAINS: - Lifebuoy all 's well ! - Starboard gangway all 's well ! - Starboard bow all 's well !
JACK: How I do hate a lee shore
PULLINGS: You think we 'll have long to wait ?
JACK: Intelligence reports had her leaving Boston on the 12th , that should put us at least a week ahead .
PULLINGS: She 'll be in for a surprise , Sir .
JACK: In for a `` Surprise '' . Now that 's wit . `` In for a Surprise '' . 'Pon my word I shall have to tell the Doctor .
PULLINGS: I 'll try not to , Sir .
JACK: What do you have there , Stephen ?
STEPHEN: The breastbone of a frigate bird . Do you emark its prodigious strength .
JACK: I do and I am not in the least surprised , for it reminds me of nothing so much as a ship under sail . See here the bowsprit . Here the mast , and here the backstays unning aft .
STEPHEN: Ten pounds sixteen ounces . I am preparing a paper for the Royal Society .
JACK: I was thinking when our business here is finished , we will have to put in to Recife for provisions . You may care to take a tour round the forests of Brazil , otanizing and collecting specimens . An anaconda or two . A giant cassowary .
STEPHEN: I should like it of all things , Jack . Thankyou .
JACK: Killick ! Killick there ! Strong coffee , and light along my topcoat .
QUARTERMASTER: Six bells and all 's well .
CALAMY: Four knots , Sir . BONDEN is still at the wheel .
BONDEN: Oi reckon as she 's liftin ' Sir , if you feels like putting your éad down . JACK takes his advice and goes below again .
VINCENT: Starboard gangway ahoy .
HOLLOM: What is it , Vincent ?
VINCENT: I heard something . A bell . HOLLOM peers out into the fog , then turns .
HOLLOM: Native fisherman perhaps . Mr. Calamy ! Midshipman CALAMY comes running forward .
CALAMY: Enemy on the larboard bow ! Beat to quarters !
JACK: Where away ?
CALAMY: Not two miles distant , Sir .
JACK: Mr. Hollom ?
HOLLOM: I saw nothing , nor heard anything either . Shall I ask them men to stand down ?
JACK: Lie down ! Everybody lie down !
JACK: Run out the guns ! Marines to the tops , and get that wounded man below !
HOLLOM: C-cast loose now Um swab . That 's ight . Run out your guns .
DAVIES: Shot . There 's no shot !
JACK: Note the time Mr. Watt . An anxious TOM PULLINGS appears .
PULLINGS: She 's out of our range , Sir ! JACK calls to his sailing master , ALLEN .
JACK: Closer , Mr. ALLEN . You must lay me alongside her at pistol-shot .
PULLINGS: Fire on the uproll .
OLD SPONGE: Witchcraft !
DOUDLE: Never seen the like of it
PULLINGS: Damn and blast you ! See to your guns ! Fire high ! Fire for the masts and igging !
STEPHEN: More sand on the floor , Mr. Higgins !
DAVIES: Wood and Lead ! Mr Nagel ! Mr Lamb ! !
DAVIES: Orlop ! We 're holed ! As LAMB dives for the ladder .
CALAMY: Davies ! Get those bodies overboard ! Mr. Hollom sir !
JEMMY DUCKS: Aye , sir ! The ship heels as she turns .
BLAKENEY: More shot ! More cartridge !
JACK: wait WAIT ! And FIRE !
BONDEN: By all that 's holy what is that ship made of ?
JACK: Belay there ye poxed son of a whore !
MOWETT: You must go below , Sir , you must let me help you below !
PULLINGS V.O: Sir .
PULLINGS: It 's the rudder .
BONDEN: It 's shot away below the waterline !
STEPHEN: Why are we not firing ?
FASTER DOUDLE: No steerage .
NEHEMIAH SLADE: We 're fish in a barrel
ALLEN: He 's coming about , Sir .
MOWETT: Should I strike the colours ?
ALLEN: I 'm afraid there 's nothing else for it .
JACK: Damned if there ai n't . We 'll tow her .
PULLINGS: Sail trimmers away , Warley , make what sail you can !
JACK: Stern-chasers to fire when she 's in ange !
MOWETT: Fire !
WARLEY: Sharp now with that fancy-line ! To the clew line from the reef points , Cully , double up and run her back again !
PULLINGS: She 's gaining on us .
JACK: Start the water , carronades over the side .
JACK: Pull ! Pull for your lives .
JACK: Quiet now . No calls , no shouts . Mr. ALLEN , signal the men in the boats to head due east .
BONDEN: Starboard haul . And stroke ! Stroke ! One side stops rowing and the boat turns .
PULLINGS: He 's beating inshore .
JACK: Keep rowing
ALLEN: I believe we 've lost her , Sir . JACK collapses his telescope .
JACK: Pass the word to ship oars 78 IN THE JOLLY BOATs . - NIGHT
LAMB: Three feet of water in the hold , Sir , but the pumps are keeping it from gaining .
JACK: Very good , Mr. Lamb .
STEPHEN: Six dead , thirteen wounded . He notices the gash on Jack 's forehead Your head
JACK: Later .
STEPHEN: A severe depressed fracture of the skull . I am not sure he will see out the night .
JACK: Mr. Blakeney ?
BLAKENEY: Just a broken arm , Sir .
STEPHEN: I will do everything possible . I know you were close to his father .
JACK: Its a scratch .
STEPHEN: I will tell you if its a scratch or not . Sit down .
JACK: How did he find us Stephen ? Seven weeks sailing and he happened in darkness on our exact position . Its uncanny . He really is a phantom
STEPHEN: Unless she was alerted to our presence , and looking for us .
JACK: Tosh . How could that be ?
STEPHEN: The French have their spies , in Britain as elsewhere . JACK You 're saying there are traitors in the Admiralty ?
ALLEN: Call her a frigate ? Ha ! You ask me she 's no more a frigate than a painted Dutchman . More like a ship of the line , a two-decker more ' n a frigate .
MOWETT: One does wonder what manner of hull she has . Our balls seemed to bounce right off her .
PULLINGS: She had the weather-gauge and long eighteens which could hit us beyond ou effective range . That 's the sum of it
ALLEN: And 40 guns to our 28 , I counted the muzzle flashes .
PULLINGS: It was an unfair match , no dishonor in defeat no dishonor at all .
ALLEN: Well , we can patch up our main and mizzen the foresail is too far gone so we 'll end our spare .
PULLINGS: Sir . Jack finally turns .
ALLEN: At Port Royal we can haul her into dry- dock , and hopefully get her home without
JACK: We 're not going home .
ALLEN: With respect , Captain , she could be half- way to Cape Horn by the time we 're epaired and underway .
JACK: Then there 's not a moment to lose .
DAVIES: Can we catch her is the question . And if we do what 's different ? She 'll just hold us off with them long eighteens til she sends us all to the bottom . All for what ?
DOUDLE: I 'll tell you for what , matey . She 's a privateer , loaded with all the gems of Araby . Think of the gold . Think of the prize-money .
HOLLAR: Hoi there ! You men jump to it !
JACK: Have her placed along the gunwale fo now , Mr. Hollar , and the guns moved to that side also .
FASTER DOUDLE: All clear below !
JACK: Damn this wind , Mr. Pullings ! The Acheron will be making a hundred and fifty miles a day in this .
PULLINGS: Aye , but hugging the coast , and stopping to board the odd merchantman
LAMB: Down . Down . Stop .
OLD SPONGE: The smaller bit . No . That bit there .
BLAKENEY: No . No . Not through my nose !
CALAMY: Its alright . William . You were dreaming .
BLAKENEY: Joe Plaice told me when you die they sew you up in your hammock with the last stitch through your nose to make sure you 're not just sleeping
CALAMY: You know old Joe , always telling stories .
BLAKENEY: Is it true though ? About the last stitch ?
CALAMY: Come on , you 'll be stitching me in mine first . BLAKENEY Not through my nose . You 'll tell them .
STEPHEN: No , I 'm afraid it will not do .
BLAKENEY: No . Mamma . Mamma .
STEPHEN: It is the laudanum speaking . You will be a regular Nelson .
BLAKENEY: Peter ? Is that you ? I dreamed they cut my arm off .
CALAMY: You would have died else .
STEPHEN: No , that is just blood . These are his ains .
SLADE: Physician he is , not one of your common surgeons .
FASTER DOUDLE: Cured Prince Billy of the marthambles and the strong fives , would n't look at you for under ten guineas on land .
DAVIES: Knows his birds and beasts too oyo , show him a beetle and he 'll tell you what it 's thinking .
JACK: Let us be off , Mr. Allen !
ALLEN: Weigh anchor ! All hands to make sail . M Hollom !
HOLLOM: Bear a hand there you fellows !
MOWETT: Up and down Sir , thick and dry fo weighing .
HOLLAR: Cheerly there in the foretop , ou William ! T'garnsl sheets ! Hands to the braces !
JACK: Speed , Mr. Boyle
BOYLE: Ten and a half knots , Sir .
KILLICK: Here we go again scrape , scrape , screech , screech and never a tune you could dance to , not if you were drunk as Davey 's sow .
STEPHEN: Is that one I know , or are we breaking new ground ?
JACK: I am trying to remember that air they played all those years ago at the Governors house in Port Mahon . You emember When we first met . Corelli if I 'm not mistaken . He plays another riff
STEPHEN: If that is your `` A '' you are very much so . This is A .
JACK: Or Locatelli . pom pom pom pom
STEPHEN: All I remember is you being unable to sit in your seat the entire performance .
JACK: Aye and you practising apon that poo ishop with your `` puddings athwart the starboard Gumbrils '' or some such arrant nonsense .
STEPHEN: No . That was off Toulon , during the lockade . At our first meeting they played this He plays a short refrain
JACK: No . No . Entirely off the mark . pom-pom- POM I have now He plays another variation
STEPHEN: Or was it something like this .
JACK: And pitch 'em up ! It 's spars and rigging we want ! MOWETT timing the gap between each broadside .
MOWETT: Three minutes ten , Sir .
JACK: Not good enough ! We must fire three oadsides to her two . Again !
BLAKENEY: As you will . Sir .
JACK: 'Spitfire ' , hop to it .
PULLINGS: Again !
JACK: Out Tompions Run out your guns Prime .
MOWETT: One minute forty-nine , Sir !
JACK: Killick ? Killick there . KILLICK appears .
KILLICK: Which it 's , Soused Hoggs-Face .
JACK: Aah ! My favorite .
PULLINGS: With your permission , Sir , Mr. Mowett has composed a short poem in honour of ou mission .
JACK: Let 's hear it , Mr. Mowett .
MOWETT: Our brotherhood , some old , some new . In blood baptized , in strength renewed . In purpose unified and true . All thoughts of home forsaken . Where duty leads us , there we go . Nor rest nor comfort shall we know . Until the unrepentant foe , is boarded sunk or taken
ALL: Aye ! Capital ! Well said ! Hear him , hea him ! 'Sunk or taken '
JACK: Aye and when we do take her we shall give her to Tom Pullings as his first command . If he do n't die before then . Bumpers up Tom
ALLEN: 'To wives and sweethearts ' . They raise their glasses -
ALL: 'To wives and sweethearts ' .
PULLINGS: And may they never meet .
JACK: Lord Nelson ? Yes . I had the honour of serving under him at the Nile . Mr. Mowett , the bottle stands by you , sir . In fact I dined with him twice , and he spoke to me on both occasions .
MOWETT: To Lord Nelson .
ALL: Lord Nelson !
JACK: You see those two weevils , Doctor ?
STEPHEN: I do .
JACK: Which would you choose ?
STEPHEN: There is not a scrap of difference . They are the same species of curculio .
JACK: But suppose you had to choose ?
STEPHEN: Then I would choose the right-hand weevil , it has a perceptible advantage in oth length and breadth .
JACK: There I have you . You are completely dished . Do n't you know in the Navy you must always choose 'the lesser of two weevils ' ?
ALLEN: 'Pon my life . He who would pun would pick a pocket . Dýe not smoke it doctor ?
STEPHEN: Sure there would be some poor thin barren minds that would catch at such a paltry clench .
PLAICE: `` And the righteous shall inherit the earth . '' The men around him stare in amazement .
BONDEN: You hear that . He said something . Joe spoke ! Say something else Joe
JOE: Handy with that gasket
BONDEN: He spoke doctor . Joe plaice spoke
MIDSHIPMEN: Our captain was very good to us . He dipped his prick in phosphorus . It shed a light all through the night . And steered us through the Bosphorus .
HOLLOM: For we 've received orders to sail for Old England . Perhaps we shall never more see you again
STEPHEN: What a wonderfully true voice Mr. Hollom does possess .
ORRAGE: Come all you thoughtless young men , A warning take by me , And never leave your happy homes to sail the raging sea .
ALLEN: This one 's by Colnett , Sir . He travelled with Captain Cook and carried a pair of Arnott 's chronometers .
KILLICK: Couple of the men to see you , Sir .
JACK: Show them in .
NAGEL: It were Warley 's idea , Sir .
WARLEY: I thought she were familiar like , then I emembered where I 'd seen her - in Boston , during the Peace .
JACK: In Boston ? WARLEY Yes , Sir . She 's Yankee built . I seen them working on her , something right strange about her scantlings . Then I seen them alls bounce off her an ' I got to thinking .
NAGEL: If you look here , Sir . One side opens up .
WARLEY: Mister Nagel here done it just like I seen her - a third layer 'tween the outer and inner ribbing - diagonal acing , see ?
JACK: Just like the U.S. Constitution - our 12 pounders could n't penetrate except at close range . He passes the model to ALLEN .
KILLICK: Which I was saving for Saluting Day , Sir .
JACK: Rouse it up , Killick , and a bottle fo Mr. ALLEN and me . Let us live whilst we 're alive ! KILLICK goes to get the bottles
STEPHEN: He says they were chased for three days till they finally our-ran her . Forty gun French privateer headed due south .
JACK: Capital . Thank him and let us be off .
STEPHEN: A Spanish farewell . `` May no new thing arrive . '' New things being generally by their nature bad .
BLAKENEY: Do you have a manual of exercises sir .
STEPHEN: Exercises ?
BLAKENEY: Physical exercises , to make the left arm as powerful as the right once was .
STEPHEN: I think that will happen with usage , at least to a certain extent .
BLAKENEY: But not completely . I will never be whole again , will I ?
STEPHEN: No but you will adapt to your new situation The natural world shows us any number of examples of how that is possible . Blakeney bites his lip
BLAKENEY: You know my father was a great fighting captain . It was always his expectation I would follow in his footsteps . I worry that with this arm I will now be good fo nothing but book learning and philosophy .
STEPHEN: Ah . Like me you mean .
BLAKENEY: I can not use a sextant , can not tie a knot or climb the rigging . Can not even dress myself . What chance to I have now of even making first lieutenant .
STEPHEN: You have every chance . You hear me every chance . Only the other day I heard the captain singing your praises . You courage , your fortitude in battle , you skill at logarithms and double elevations whatever they may be . And when you are ated lieutenant you shall have someone to tie your bootlaces for you . Aye and help you with your jacket . Here take my handkerchief . I believe we are summonsed to dinner .
WARLEY: Sail on the larboard bow !
JACK: Where away ?
PULLINGS: Hull down , two points off the larboard eam . JACK takes the telescope .
JACK: Set studdingsails and top gallants . Then wet the sails and have the idlers placed along the rail .
BLAKENEY: Is it him , Sir ?
JACK: Touch wood , Mr. Blakeney . And I fancy she plans to out-run us . Ask Dr. Maturin to join us , he loves a good chase .
MOWETT: Lifelines fore and aft !
JACK: Speed , Mr. Calamy ?
CALAMY: Twelve knots , Sir !
JEMMY DUCKS: We 're cracking on , eh ?
FASTER DOUDLE: We 'll be cracking off presently if he does n't watch it .
SLADE: No , he knows this ship . He knows what she can take .
PULLINGS: We can just see her topsails . She 's made her turn westwards .
LAMB: I ca n't vouch for the mizzen Sir , not ound Cape Horn .
JACK: I 'll not lose her now . Set a course westwards . Both men accept this and leave .
PULLINGS: What , Sir ?
HIGGINS: You reckon Captain will keep chasing him 'round the Horn with every stitch of canvas flying ?
DAVIES: I reckon he 'd chase him to the gates of hell if he has to .
PLAICE: And that 's where we 're all going if he does n't take in sail .
JACK: Strike the topgallants .
BONDEN: Man overboard !
JACK: Swim for the wreckage , man ! Then to PULLINGS .
BONDEN: She 's broaching !
PULLINGS: It 's acting as a sea-anchor ! We must cut it loose , Sir !
JACK: Axes !
KILLICK: He 's been at it again .
BLACK BILL: Who 's that then ?
KILLICK: The Jonah .
BLACK BILL: What Jonah ?
STEPHEN: The deaths in actual battle are the easiest . For my own part - those who die under the knife or from some consequent infection I have to remind myself that it is the enemy who killed them , and not me . Warley was a casualty of war , as surely as if a French ball had taken him .
JACK: On the contrary . I insist on it .
STEPHEN: There is talk below decks of turning ack . Or rather that we should have turned back some weeks ago . Of course the men would follow `` Lucky Jack '' anywhere , and usually in the confident expectation of victory . But that of course is the problem .
JACK: What is the problem ?
STEPHEN: That you are not accustomed to defeat Jack . That you have taken it too personally . That chasing this larger , faster ship , with its long guns , is eginning to smack of pride 'which goeth efore destruction ' ?
JACK: It 's not pride nor anything like it , it 's a question of duty .
STEPHEN: 'Duty ' , ah yes . The naval signal for end of discussion .
JACK: You can be as 'satiric ' as you like , Stephen , but I have my orders . She is attacking our whalers . For why ? Without whales we have no boot polish , nor any soap , nor oil for our lamps , not to oil our sabres and muskets . Destroying ou whalers could win the war for Napoleon . Which is why we must catch this Acheron . As a man of learning surely you can see that .
STEPHEN: At whatever the cost ?
JACK: Any whatever cost I choose to pay . And I will calculate that myself , Stephen without reference to your friends in the ward room .
HOLLOM: Cast off .
JACK: We 'll have to go further south , get around this bloody west wind .
PULLINGS: How far south ?
JACK: As far as is necessary , Mr. Pullings . The sixtieth parallel if need be .
MOWETT: Then we upon the globes last verge shall go to view the ocean leaning on the sky from thence our rolling neighbours we shall know and on the hidden world securely pry !
HOLLAR: Rise and shine ! Show a leg there , tumble up , tumble up - sleepers awake !
JACK: Praise be . At last .
STEPHEN: Pray what is there to celebrate ?
JACK: We have made our turn northward , Doctor . We are headed back toward the sun The officers give a slightly ragged cheer .
KILLICK: Which I was just coming . He lays it on the table .
JACK: Gentlemen , I give you our destination .
STEPHEN: The Galapagos Islands .
PULLINGS: 'Pon my word so it is . Look here 's Narborough , Chatham and Hood
JACK: That 's where the whalers are , ai n't it M Allen . So that 's where the Acheron will e headed .
KILLICK: That engagement off Recife his whole gun crew killed and him not a mark on him . Soon as he went up the mizzen mast Warley falls . And whose watch was it when we lost our wind ? HOLLOM sees them looking at him .
TROLLOPE: One glass per man , sir , Captain 's orders .
STEPHEN: A mere thimbleful , Corporal , fo scientific purposes only .
JACK: Stephen . Will we never make a sailor of you ? The doldrums is a condition , not a egion . But you tend to strike 'em here between the trades , and the sou'easterlies . I hope the Acheron is having it as bad as we are .
STEPHEN: Assuming he is heading for the Galapagos , and not some other point in all this vastness ?
JACK: Come . I 'd have thought you 'd be delighted to go there . It is said to be a natural paradise
STEPHEN: In truth I 'd be delighted with the merest guano stained rock provided it did n't sway beneath my feet
JACK: Well , we 'll take on food and water once we 're there , and as compensation for not having put ashore in Brazil I pledge that during that time , several days at least , you can wander at will , catching bugs and eetles to your heart 's delight . You will e the first naturalist to set foot on the islands . That is my solemn promise
STEPHEN: I accept , provided the men have not mutinied and thrown us all overboard efore we get there .
JACK: Mutiny ? No . They are already counting their share of the prize money .
STEPHEN: Another week of this and they shall gladly give it up for a glass of clean water .
JACK: Ach , Stephen . Stephen . Pray stop you ellyacheing . We shall have rain presently , and if not we shall damned well tow ourselves out of this .
HOLLOM: Stroke . Stroke DAVIES I heard he were on the Fair Marion as foundered off Tresco . And he were on the Zephyrus what exploded at Trafalgar .
BONDEN: M-a-s-t mast
STEPHEN: Is that man completely mad ? Mr. Howard , a petrel is not good eating !
HOWARD: Were you never a man for sporting , Doctor ? Why you could shoot all day in these waters with two men loading !
CALAMY: Blakeney
WILLIAMSON: Rye
CALAMY: Swift
WILLIAMSON: Boyle
CALAMY: All right , come on Addison .
WILLIAMSON: It 's tails . We attack .
BLAKENEY: Ow ow ow !
WILLIAMSON: Yield .
CALAMY: Let go of him .
WILLIAMSON: Yield ! !
CALAMY: It 's just powder . There was n't a ball in it , just powder . He helps BLAKENEY to his feet .
BLAKENEY: No .
CALAMY: What 's wrong ? I saved you .
BLAKENEY: I did n't need to be saved .
JACK: Master at arms ! Take that man below and clap him in irons . Mr. Pullings , defaulters at six bells .
HOLLOM: No , Sir , I intended to but the right words just did n't
JACK: 'The right words ' ? He failed to salute you . It 's deliberate insubordination . HOLLOM looks at the floor , mumbles -
HOLLOM: They do n't like me , Sir .
JACK: They what ? Speak up , man !
HOLLOM: I 've tried to get to know the men a bit , Sir , be friendly like , but they 've taken a set against me . Always whispering when I go past , giving me looks . But , I 'll set that to rights , be tougher on them from now on .
JACK: You ca n't make 'friends ' with the foremast jacks , they 'll despise you in the end . Nor do you need be a tyrant . It 's leadership they want , strength , espect .
HOLLOM: I 'm very sorry , Sir .
JACK: You 're what twenty-three , twenty-four ?
HOLLOM: Twenty-five next Friday .
JACK: You 've failed to pass for lieutenant twice . You ca n't spend the rest of you life as a midshipman .
HOLLOM: I 'll try harder , Sir .
JACK: Well , it 's an unfortunate business , Hollom . Damned unfortunate .
NAGEL: No , Sir .
JACK: Have his officers anything to say fo him ?
HOLLAR: Seized up , Sir .
JACK: One dozen . Bosun 's mate , do your duty .
STEPHEN: I was merely remarking that you have always prided yourself on not being a flogging captain and this
JACK: I am not a `` flogging captain '' . I have not once rigged the grating on this voyage , not once in twelve thousand miles . Besides , I wager you will find a deal more brutality on land .
STEPHEN: I 'm not a party to it on land .
JACK: Well you are party to it on my ship . Men must be governed . Often not wisely I grant you , but there are hierarchies even in nature , as you 've often said yourself .
STEPHEN: Hierarchies . That is the excuse of every tyrant in history . Of Nero . Of Boneparte .
JACK: Yes . Fine words I 'm sure
STEPHEN: We are not animals and I for one am opposed to authority , that egg of misery and oppression..
JACK: Very fine words Stephen , but In these current circumstances , hard-work and firm discipline is what keeps our little wooden world together .
STEPHEN: And grog I suppose .
JACK: Of course . What of it ? Of course they have their grog ! STEPHEN You know Nagel was drunk when he insulted Hollom . And Higgins is never sober . Even the midshipmen
STEPHEN: Well a shameful tradition it is too . To have them pressed from their homes , kept in a permanent state of dull inebriation .
JACK: Stephen
STEPHEN: confined for months in a wooden prison , Never more than a few hours sleep and flogged when drunken idleness drives them to . JACK Stephen ! I warn you that friend or no I will not have you talk of the service like that .
JACK: Well I will not hear them ! From you o anyone . You understand ! Things are as they are for good or bad whether or not they have a place in your damned papist philosophy . If you are here to make music then sit down and play . If not be gone , for you have come to the wrong shop for anarchy !
BLAKENEY: Are you all right , Hollom ?
CALAMY: He 's not sick . He 's useless . He 's just dodging work . BLAKENEY Oh shut up Calamay . What do you know about anything ? CALAMY glares at BLAKENEY .
PLAICE: Beg your pardon , your honour , but Mr. Howard just shot a sea-monster !
HOWARD: Doctor ! The very man . STEPHEN moves to the rail , looks out .
STEPHEN: Mr. Howard , let me beg you , if the men ca n't eat it or I ca n't dissect it , please do not shoot every creature you see .
KILLICK: What did I tell you ? The ship 's accursed .
JACK: What is that abominable noise , for God 's sake ?
PULLINGS: I have no idea , Sir .
MOWETT: You do n't think it 's the Acheron , Sir ?
JACK: The enemy can not come on us without a wind , Mr. Mowett .
STEPHEN: I 'm sure I 've never heard the like .
JACK: Creature ?
STEPHEN: A manatee . A sea-elephant possibly . Though I have never known one with a cry like this .
JACK: Bosun . Fire off some flares .
MOWETT: Perhaps some poor shipwreck ?
JACK: Padeen . What are you doing on the quarterdeck ?
BLACK BILL: Duppies make that noise . KILLICK See . They know all about this in Africa .
DOUDLE: What 's a duppie ?
BLACK BILL: That Warley . Swallow by a fish . Spirit ca n't get out . Him duppie now .
SLADE: Captain do n't even know what that noise e. General nods of agreement .
DOUDLE: Doctor neither , and he knows everything .
KILLICK: Joe here 's got the most experience in these matters , and new brains to boot , let 's hear it from Joe .
PLAICE: It 's the Jonah causing it . That howling thing is a signal to the Phantom-Ship . He 's calling it up , do n't you see ? Every time he 's on watch the ship appears . You wait and see , the ghost-ship will appea any time tonight , and take us all straight to the hot-place .
JACK: You do n't think ?
STEPHEN: Mr Hollom . Sir . Try to contain yourself . Hold his head . Mr Hollom . Padeen
JACK: Well ?
STEPHEN: There 's nothing physically wrong with him . He thinks he 's been cursed by the 0men .
JACK: Then he probably has been . Sailors will abide a great deal , but never a Jonah . It 's like a white crow - the others peck it to death .
STEPHEN: A 'Jonah ' ? My God , you believe it too .
JACK: I desired to save you the trouble of looking for a cure . No doubt it will all e sorted by the morning .
BLAKENEY: Mr. Hollom ! You gave me such a start . Are you better now ? HOLLOM 's breathing does indeed seem easier .
HOLLOM: Much better , thank you .
BLAKENEY: I think the creature is going away .
HOLLOM: I am sure of it .
BLAKENEY: Man overboard !
JACK: The fact is , not all of us become the men we once hoped we might be . But we are all God 's creatures . If some of us thought ill of Mr. Hollom , or spoke ill of him , or failed him in respect of fellowship , then we ask your forgiveness , Lord , and we ask for his .
BONDEN: Strike eight bells . QUARTERMASTER Turn the glass and strike the bell . The glass is inverted . The bell tolls .
BLAKENEY: Give you joy , sir ! We have raised the Galapagos !
DOUDLE: Wot ? There must be wimmun . T'ai n't natural .
STEPHEN: How extraordinary .
BLAKENEY: What , sir ?
STEPHEN: Those birds !
BLAKENEY: The dragons do n't seem to bother 'em .
STEPHEN: They are a type of iguana I should think , and therefore vegetarian .
BLAKENEY: Will you catch one ?
STEPHEN: Yes . Most certainly . And if we can , some eggs .
BLAKENEY: I mean the great lizards .
STEPHEN: Oh !
BONDEN: Ha ! There 's one going for a swim .
STEPHEN: No . Iguanas are land animals .
BONDEN: Not these ones .
JACK: All hands about ship !
NEHEMIAH SLADE: By your leave sir , by your leave . HOLLAR Helms a'lee - off tacks and sheets - mainsail haul !
HOGG: God bless you . Thank you , shipmates .
ALLEN: No swearing on the quarterdeck .
JACK: Go on .
HOGG: Then they burnt our bloody ship and headed off , bunch of fugging pirates . Looking pointedly at Allen
JACK: And her course ?
HOGG: Maybe a point south of west . Following the rest of the whaling fleet . JACK Mr. Mowett , these men to be entered on the ship 's books . Mr. Allen , lay a course west sou'west . As ALLEN hurries away shouting orders -
PULLINGS: Should we not take on fresh supplies , Sir ? Those tortoises JACK There 's not a moment to lose , Mr. Pullings .
STEPHEN: Have you forgotten your promise ?
JACK: Subject to the requirements of the service , Stephen . I could not in all conscience delay for the sake of an iguano or a giant peccary - interesting no doubt , but of no immediate application . STEPHEN How can you dismiss , out of hand , the ounty of nature ? Knowledge that that will help to progress JACK I can see nothing on shore that will progress our mission . STEPHEN But how can we possibly know what lies on these islands , perhaps some knowledge that may save life , that JACK I will tell you how to save lives Stephen . Inform me how to guide this ship , undetected , under the nose of a 40 gun frigate . That is the job in hand sir .
STEPHEN: Well perhaps there 's an opportunity to serve both our objectives . As I understand it you mean to go round the end of this long island , then start you voyage . I could walk across it , be on the other side long before JACK shakes his head .
JACK: you forget yourself , sir .
STEPHEN: No Jack , You have forgotten your self . You once believed in the rights of each individual man no matter how useless o lowly . But it seems to me now that the long exercise of power has brought you to the point where even a solemn promise
JACK: The promise was conditional .
STEPHEN: a promise to a friend of ten years standing who has stood by you and supported you . JACK I command a King 's ship , not a private yacht
JACK: and we have no time for your damned hobbies , sir !
BLAKENEY: Sir , I found a curious beetle walking on the deck .
STEPHEN: I 'm sure of it .
BLAKENEY: Were you to have walked all day on the island , you might never have come across it .
STEPHEN: That is more than likely , sure . BLAKENEY passes it to STEPHEN .
BLAKENEY: You can have it .
STEPHEN: Thank you , Mr. Blakeney .
KILLICK: No music ? That 's a shame He sets down the toasted cheese .
JACK: Yes , Killick . Just the one .
ALLEN: Martha 's vineyard .
HOGG: No , this here 's from Boston . I was married there once .
ALLEN: Any road , it 's a Yankee barrel .
HOGG: What they call a Bedford Hog in New England . MOWETT The Acheron touched at Boston .
ALLEN: One ca n't say with any accuracy but
HOGG: Yes you can . There 's no sea chummer on it , and the dowels is sound .
JACK: Continue due west , Mr. Bonden .
PLAICE: Have you seen the bird , doctor ?
STEPHEN: I have not - no bird these many days . What kind of a bird ?
PLAICE: A sort of albatross I believe , or perhaps a prodigious great mew . He has been following the ship since there he is , crossing our wake !
HOWARD: My God , man ! I 'm so sorry . The bird dropped low . I did n't see you there ! JACK is there , shouting -
JACK: Calamy ! Get Higgins ! Padeen , Davies , carry the Doctor below .
STEPHEN: It 's all right , I am quite capable of walking . He tries to stand , crumples . 225 . STEPHEN 's CABIN - DAY
JACK: Are you equal to the task ?
HIGGINS: I 'll need to read up on the Doctor 's ooks , like . Study some pictures he has , get my bearings . Be better on land , but I 'll manage somehow .
JACK: You men get about your business .
JEMMY DUCKS: sail on the horizon , sir . Hull down , unning west . It may be a couple of days efore we can catch her . STEPHEN nods , all he wants is quiet .
PULLINGS: It might be the Acheron . If we put on more sail we 'd come up with her before nightfall .
MOWETT: Davies ! Slade !
STEPHEN: Tell me this was n't on my account ?
JACK: No . It was because of Higgins . Ca n't have him poking around in you elly without a solid platform to work on . He ducks as they enter -
STEPHEN: Not Higgins . I do this with my own hand . Jack frowns , unsure what he means by this .
HIGGINS: Aye , she 'll patch up nicely , sir .
STEPHEN: Easy away , Jack . Handsomely with the etractor . Higgins , look to the Captain , while I swab .
BLAKENEY: Well sir , Padeen and I have been doing some collecting for you . The beetles each come with a specimen of plant they were found on . Ooops . Catch him , Padeen ! There he goes .
STEPHEN: 'Pon my word you have the makings of a true naturalist . BLAKENEY is flattered but unsure .
BLAKENEY: Well sir , perhaps I could combine them , and be a kind of Fighting-Naturalist , like yourself ?
STEPHEN: Shall we take a tour of your aviary ?
BLAKENEY: Should you really be up ?
STEPHEN: Yes . Padeen !
JACK: Oh , a week perhaps . There is no great hurry .
STEPHEN: But surely , we must make haste for the Marquesas ?
JACK: It may not have been the Acheron that we sighted . Nor can we be sure of he destination . No , I think we shall go home now , before peace breaks out with France , God forbid .
STEPHEN: But how will it sit with the Admiralty ? To have spent six months in a fruitless pursuit and then come home empty-handed ?
JACK: `` Empty-handed '' ? Not a bit of it . What about these plants and animals which Blakeney has been collecting ? The British museum will need an entire new wing fo 'em .
STEPHEN: I fear , Jack , you have burdened me with a debt I can never repay .
JACK: Tosh . Name a shrub after me . Something prickly and hard to eradicate .
STEPHEN: A shrub ? I shall name a giant tortoise Testudo Aubreii !
BLAKENEY: Doctor , would you think it very unscientific of me to ride on the back of one of those tortoises .
STEPHEN: No , Mr. Blakeney . I would think it an experiment of absolutely vital importance . But afterwards , I do desire to find that flightless cormorant , assuming that is what it is , and that I still have strength enough to catch it .
BLAKENEY: Sir , you must hurry !
STEPHEN: A moment ! You 're a worse tyrant than any ship 's captain . He 's breathing hard , exhausted .
BLAKENEY: You must carry him , Padeen !
JACK: I forgot to ask you - did you see you ird ?
STEPHEN: I did not . My greatest discovery was you phantom .
JACK: Indeed it was , I 'm sorry
STEPHEN: Not a bit of it . William and I made a unique discovery . Handing JACK the jar and magnifying glass .
JACK: A phasmid ?
BLAKENEY: It 's an insect disguised as a stick . JACK stares at the creature .
JACK: Mr. Hollar , rouse up all the yellow paint we have . I want six men with brushes slung over the side . Doudle !
DOUDLE: Yessir .
JACK: Get your sail makers working on this . Sixty yards by five yards with an eyelet every seven feet .
DOUDLE: Aye , Sir .
JACK: Have Nagel patch it up and light a fire in it . Mr. Calamy !
CALAMY: Aye , Sir .
JACK: Once we 're underway , replace some of the sails with the oldest , most patched set we have .
CALAMY: They 'll be in the afterhold , Sir . I 'll need some men to move all the clutter .
JACK: Good . Spread it around the foredeck . The more mess the better .
CALAMY: Haul away !
HOGG: There , Sir . A mainmast toplight . JACK has to use a telescope .
JACK: You 've got good eyes , Hogg . Shouts down to the helm -
STEPHEN: I see . A wolf in sheep in sheep 's clothing
JACK: A phasmid , doctor . It was you what gave me the idea .
STEPHEN: I 'm not sure a phasmid can be a predator .
JACK: No ? Well this one is .
CALAMY: Thank you .
BLAKENEY: You 'll make lieutenant out of this . The others come in .
BOYLE: He already has . 'Acting ' 3rd Lieutenant Peter Calamy . Oohs and aahs from all .
BLAKENEY: Then I 'll see you at the forecastle , 'Lieutenant ' .
CALAMY: That 's not your station .
BLAKENEY: But naturally I 'll board with you ?
CALAMY: I 'm sorry , Will . Captain 's orders . BLAKENEY is devastated . Rye bursts in , in a state of high excitement .
RYE: She 's seen us !
MOWETT: She 's asking us to heave to . Shall I give the order ?
JACK: No , make a show of fleeing upwind , but panicky and disorganized , like a whale might do . Allen smiles at this unintended slight
BLAKENEY: May I speak with you , Sir .
JACK: No saluting , Mr. Blakeney , we 're whalers here .
BLAKENEY: Mr. Calamy says I am not in the boarding party , I wanted to say -
JACK: I know what you want to say and my answe is no . I promised your mother I would eturn you in one piece and I have already failed her on that score . You will command a gun and then retire to defend the quarterdeck here with Dr. Maturin .
BLAKENEY: But sir - JACK Go to your station , Mr. Blakeney .
JACK: We 're a long way from home . A long way from anywhere , But if Britain rules the waves she rules these waves too . And the blow we shall deal fo his Majesty here will be felt just as keenly aye - and cheered just as loudly - as any dealt at Trafalgar o Cape St. Vincent .
CALAMY: Three cheers for the Captain . MEN Huzzah huzzah huzzah !
KILLICK: I took the liberty , Doctor .
STEPHEN: Thank you , Killick . JACK steers one-handed as he sips his coffee .
JACK: Mr. Mowett ? A poem might be in order . Another shot through the sails .
MOWETT: A poem , Sir ?
JACK: What !
MOWETT: they were only people of the merchant service , of-course , Sir .
JACK: We have her Mr. Mowett . Strike the Portuguese colours and run up the Jack Mr. Pullings . Canvas off the gun-ports , and run 'em out . Mr. Howard ? Marines away aloft .
PULLINGS: On the uproll ! Fire for the mainmast as you sight her !
JACK: Now Mr Bonden ! Hard a'starboard !
CALAMY: Look to our quarter-deck !
JACK: Where is your captain ? Ou est votre capitaine ?
DOCTOR: Il mávait prie de vous donner ceci . Passing JACK the captain 's sword .
CALAMY: He 's dead , sir .
JACK: John Henry ALLEN Joseph NAGEL William Horner Stephen Winston Boyle and Lieutenant William Blakeney We therefore commit their bodies to the deep , looking for the resurrection of the ody , when the sea shall give up he dead Amen .
ALL: Amen .
JACK: Signal 'Parole prisoners Valparaiso '
WILLIAMSON: You mean Lieutenant Pullings , Sir ?
JACK: No . Captain Pullings .
RYE: .then 'Rendezvous Portsmouth . God- speed , Captain Pullings . '
STEPHEN: Shall we begin ? JACK pauses , gazing into space .
JACK: What ?
STEPHEN: While I was tending the prisoners they told me their doctor died of fever , two weeks ago . There was no doctor on that ship when we boarded it . And I doubt you will find one there now .
KILLICK: That 's the last of the cheese and like as not they 'll leave it seizing to thei plates with their tweedly tweedly tweedly .
DOCTOR: What are you going to do when you get out of here ? You 're going to have to wear a elt for six months , maybe a year
FREDDIE: What kind of belt ?
DOCTOR: A surgical belt . You wo n't be able to do very heavy lifting .
FREDDIE: .I try to stay away from that .
DOCTOR: But you spend time outdoors .
DOCTOR: What do you do ?
DOCTOR: You did n't have very much on you when you were admitted . Where were you going ?
FREDDIE: I was on my way to Placerville . To the Fair . Had a job waiting for me , with a friend of mine . He does n't know where I am .
DOCTOR: How old are you , Freddie ?
DOCTOR: Why do n't you turn honest ? You seem like an intelligent fellow . 'Quick on your feet - you like to drink ?
FREDDIE: It 's a weakness . But I like it .
DOCTOR: I know what the other is too .
FREDDIE: How can you tell that ? I 'm clean .
DOCTOR: The tattoo 's .
FREDDIE: Is that a weakness
DOCTOR: No one ever made money chasing girls .
FREDDIE: You 're wrong . This tatoo 's my Auntie .
DOCTOR: Who 's that ?
FREDDIE: My Auntie Bertha , But that does n't mean I do n't have a weakness
DOCTOR: College ?
FREDDIE: I tried that , it did n't work .
DOCTOR: Why 'd you leave ?
FREDDIE: Sometimes my hypo 's get the best of me , I really feel like walking into the street and hitting people 's hats off .
DOCTOR: That 's how you end up like this . With a urst appendix .
FREDDIE: That 's when I know it 's time to get to the sea.. what kind of belt ?
DOCTOR: A medical belt . Similar for lifting . You 're going to need some money . What do you plan to do ?
FREDDIE: I 'm going to pay back the hospital . And you .
DOCTOR: You do n't owe me anything . I 'm on surgical duty . But you 're expected to pay the hospital for medicines . And your belt .
FREDDIE: Alright . I intend to do that . You saying you have a job for me ? What ? As an orderly ?
DOCTOR: You could n't be an orderly , it 's too much lifting and a lot of things you 'd have to learn . But maybe you could run an elevator , something of that sort .
FREDDIE: I want to get out of here , but I also like it here . You think I was gon na die ?
DOCTOR: I know you were , Freddie .
FREDDIE: I do n't know . I 'm not saying you did n't save me . butI ca n't seem to die .
DOCTOR: Too lucky ?
FREDDIE: Something like that .
DOCTOR: Were you in the service ?
FREDDIE: Yes , sir .
DOCTOR: Navy ?
DOCTOR: Your luck was up this time , Freddie . You should have seen the pus in your belly . Something to think about . It 's not too late to stop being a weisnheimer , no matter what you think . you 're still a young man .
FREDDIE: You come any closer and I 'll slice you
FIGURE: I 'm not after your dough , I just want to talk with you -
FREDDIE: You can talk standing in front of the estaurant , around the corner

FREDDIE: .well I apologize if I got a little out of hand last night - I 'm just looking for work and your ship looked good , soit 's a nice looking ship .
MASTER: Do n't apologize . You 're a scoundrel . How I miss the days of working a fou mastered schooner with nothing but salt horse , dried peas and a couple quarts of water.. .the present-day maritimer 's seem so much more fragile , do n't you think ? You - you 're and adventurer .

MASTER: Are you sure you have n't lived here efore ?
SOCIALITE: I do n't know .
MASTER: What 's your name ?
MARGARET: Margaret .
MASTER: Are you sure ?
JOHN MORE: Some of this seems quite like hypnosis , is it not ?
MASTER: Oh no , this is funny . It 's quite the everse . Man is hypnotized . What we do is un-hypnotize him of the shackles . Allow him to raise his awareness and IQ .
JOHN MORE: What is the difference between this and psychotherapy ?
MASTER: Yes . Well . They are very different . No . Psychoanalysis , they lay back . No , no , no . Do n't associate us with such people ! That 's terrible why that 's a bad manner do n't you know ? I mean at that usiness about sex and all that . That 's for the neurotic or the person who is insane or something like that . That 's nothing to do with us . They 've failed . That 's for the fortunate few who can afford the fees .
JOHN MORE: But some of this does in fact seem to share quite a lot with Dr. Freud and modern psychotherapy , does it not ?
MASTER: No it does not . This is an exact science , you see . Comparable to physics o chemistry - but simpler . It 's engineering . Herr Freud had his chance and contributed some very workable data , ut in the end , he failed . So that 's that .
JOHN MORE: And how long does this take ?
MASTER: That depends . But it can be quite fast . Quite fast . Or it can take some time . Sometimes less than 36 hours .
JOHN MORE: 36 hours ? And you 're saying that these methods can cure leukemia according to your book and what you 've just said ?
MASTER: Some forms of leukemia , 22 cases tested . 22 cases cured . Those are the results .
JOHN MORE: You can understand scepticism , can you not ?
MASTER: Oh , yes , of course , yes . And this is to e expected and welcome . For without it we 'd be positive 's with no negatives - therefore zero . charge . We must have it .
JOHN MORE: Are you a religious people ?
MASTER: We are not incorporated as a religion , no . But remember this that religion has come uniformly from a philosophy . Philosophy is senior to religion . You could call us a religion of religions .
JOHN MORE: Are you saying then that any religion is ather narrow in its outlook ?
MASTER: No , no , no . I have no quarrel with man 's elief 's , but religions in general can be pre-occupied with a God or Idol o something of some such nature who is merely trying to fill the universe with a lot of little replicas of himself - we are trying to free the individual - not end to a will of a God , you see . And if our teachings can reconcile these views it would be doing a great service to
JOHN MORE: Do you think it can ?
MASTER: I not only think it can , I know it does .
JOHN MORE: You mentioned 'good science ' and what it does.. .but does n't that , by definition , allow for more than one opinion ?
MASTER: Indeed , indeed . Which is why ou gathering of day-ta is so far reaching -
JOHN MORE: Otherwise you merely have the will of one man - which is the basis of cult , is it not ?
MASTER: T'is , t'is , indeed . Thankfully we are , all of us , working at break-neck speeds and in unison towards catching the minds fatal flaws and correcting it back to it 's original state of perfect - whilst ighting civilization .
JOHN MORE: I must say that I find it quite
JOHN MORE: I can answer for myself . My name is John More .
JOHN MORE: If you 're not allowing some sort of discussion regarding your beliefs -
JOHN MORE: I 'm sorry if you 're unwilling to defend your beliefs in any kind of rational
A WOMAN: She 's sick ! Please ! She 's sick !
JOHN MORE: This is n't a lecture hall , this is Mrs. Purcell 's home -
FREDDIE: You have the name 's and information of the guests at this lady 's party ?
BILL WHITE: Yes .
FREDDIE: You 're coming with me . Get up . I need some help and you wan na make a good show , no ? Who 's paying your way ?
BILL WHITE: I do n't think this is right to do -
FREDDIE: You do n't know what we 're going to do , so do n't bother thinking about this anymore

CLARK: I read the first book . I worked at Boeing for three years . When I read the book , I did n't want to waste my time there anymore . I came to help the Cause .
FREDDIE: What did it say ?
CLARK: I 'm skeptical of everything . Always have een . All I know is I used to not be able to sleep . Now I sleep through the night . I spent 18 months at the Presidio with every Army head-shrinker they had and not one did as much for me as Book One did . That 's simple arithmetic to me . And I met Elizabeth , so
FREDDIE: That 's good .
CLARK: He changes things . And the research is hard to keep up with . None of this is done by a long shot . Sometimes it 's easy to get lost .
FREDDIE: He 's a very smart man . I can tell that . I do n't understand myself but - more time with it and I might - I feel better - I feel like I 've more to do with my life since I met him and I JUST met him . So - that ca n't be a bad thing , right ?

CLARK: You know at first there were rumors going around about you
FREDDIE: What about me ?

FREDDIE: What ? Steal what ?

CLARK: The Split Saber .
FREDDIE: I still do n't understand what you 're saying
CLARK: The Darkest Cloud ? AKA Dual Saber ? Or The Split Saber ?

FREDDIE: The truth about all what ?
CLARK: Life on this planet .
FREDDIE: What is something like that worth ?
CLARK: He said he was once offered $ 25,000 dollars for itbut the price is . how could you figure out what the price is on something like that ? Heretofore unknown . Incalculable by man .
FREDDIE: Where is it ?
CLARK: It 's locked away in a vault somewhere ? I do n't know .
FREDDIE: Where ?
CLARK: No one knows for sure . Some say Phoenix or the desert outside Los Angeles .
FREDDIE: Needed for what ?
CLARK: ? I do n't know .

MASTER: Your problems are n't with your auntie o your mommy or daddy or any such things .

TRINITY: They 're watching you . Something happened and they found out about you . Normally , if our target is exposed we let it go . But this time , we ca n't do that .
NEO: I do n't understand
TRINITY: You came here because you wanted to know the answer to a hacker 's question .

MORPHEUS: At last .
NEO: It 's an honor .
MORPHEUS: Please . Come . Sit . He nods to Trinity .
NEO: You could say that .
MORPHEUS: I can see it in your eyes . You have the look of a man who accepts what he sees because he is expecting to wake up .
NEO: You 're Morpheus , you 're a legend . Most hackers would die to meet you .
MORPHEUS: Yes . Thank you . But I think we oth know there 's more to it than that . Do you believe in fate , Neo ?
NEO: No .
MORPHEUS: Why not ?
NEO: Because I do n't like the idea that I 'm not in control of my life .
MORPHEUS: I know exactly what you mean . Again , that smile that could cut glass .
NEO: What gift ?
MORPHEUS: I 've watched you , Neo . You do not use a computer like a tool . You use it like it was part of yourself . What you can do inside a computer is not normal . I know . I 've seen it . What you do is magic . Neo shrugs .
NEO: It 's not magic .
MORPHEUS: But it is , Neo . It is . How else would you describe what has been happening to you ? He leans forward .
NEO: Free from what ?
MORPHEUS: From the Matrix .
NEO: What truth ?
MORPHEUS: That you are a slave , Neo . That you , like everyone else , was born into bondage kept inside a prison that you can not smell , taste , or touch . A prison for your mind .
NEO: How ?
MORPHEUS: Hold out your hands .
CYPHER: Shit .
TRINITY: I knew he would .
CYPHER: Morpheus , I know what you believe ut I think this is a mistake . We 're rushing him . He 's old . I 'm afraid he might pop .
MORPHEUS: Have n't I always told you , Cypher , not to let fear control your life . Apoc , are we on-line ?
APOC: Almost .
NEO: Apoc ? You wrote the Four Horsemen Virus .
APOC: That 's right .
MORPHEUS: Neo , time is always against us . Will you take a seat there ?
NEO: A little .
MORPHEUS: Tell me about it .
NEO: Essentially , it 's a hardware system that uses an apparatus ; headgear , gloves and whatever to make you feel that you are in a computer program .
MORPHEUS: If the virtual reality apparatus , as you called it , was wired to all of your senses and controlled them completely , would you be able to tell the difference between the virtual world and the real world ?
NEO: You might not , no .
MORPHEUS: No , you would n't . Neo whispers to Trinity .
NEO: You did all this ?
MORPHEUS: The pill you took is part of a trace program . It 's going to make things feel a bit strange .
NEO: Shit
MORPHEUS: Just relax , Neo .
NEO: Uh-oh
TRINITY: It 's going into replication .
MORPHEUS: Apoc ?
APOC: Still nothing .

DOZER: He needs a lot of work .
MORPHEUS: I know . Dozer and Morpheus are operating on Neo .
NEO: What are you doing ?
MORPHEUS: Your muscles have atrophied . We 're rebuilding them .
NEO: Why do my eyes hurt ?
MORPHEUS: You 've never used them before .
NEO: Morpheus , what 's happened to me ? What is this place ?
MORPHEUS: More important than what is when ?
NEO: When ?
MORPHEUS: You believe the year is 1997 when in fact it is much closer to 2197 . I ca n't say for certain what yea it is because we honestly do not know . The wind is knocked from Neo 's chest .
NEO: That 's not possible .
MORPHEUS: I promised you the truth , Neo , and the truth is that the world you were living in was a lie .
NEO: How ?
MORPHEUS: I 'll show you .
NEO: Right now , we 're inside a compute program ?
MORPHEUS: Wild , is n't it ? Neo 's hands run over the cracked leather .
NEO: This is n't real ?
MORPHEUS: What is real ? How do you define eal ? If you 're talking about your senses , what you feel , taste , smell , or see , then all you 're talking about are electrical signals interpreted by your brain .
NEO: What happened ?
MORPHEUS: It started early in the twenty- first century , with the birth of artificial intelligence , a singular consciousness that spawned an entire race of machines .
NEO: No ! I do n't believe it ! It 's not possible !
MORPHEUS: I did n't say that it would be easy , Neo . I just said that it would be the truth . The room without walls begins to spin .
NEO: Stop ! Let me out ! I want out !
TRINITY: Easy , Neo . Easy .
NEO: Do n't touch me ! Get away from me !
CYPHER: He 's going to pop !
NEO: I ca n't go back , can I ?
MORPHEUS: No . But if you could , would you eally want to ? Neo is n't sure of that answer .
NEO: I told you I do n't believe in fate . Morpheus smiles , leaning towards hin .
MORPHEUS: But I do , Neo . I do . He stands up .
NEO: For what ?
MORPHEUS: Your training .
TANK: Morning . Did you sleep ?
NEO: No .
TANK: You will tonight . I guarantee it . I 'm Tank . I 'll be your operator .
NEO: You do n't have
TANK: Any holes ? Nope . Me and my other Dozer , we are 100 percent pure , old fashioned , home-grown human . Born free . Right here in the real world . Genuine child of Zion .
NEO: Zion ?
TANK: Zion is the place , man . You 'll see it one day . Last human city . All we got left . Tank smiles .
NEO: Jiujitsu ? I 'm going to learn jujitsu ?
TANK: Hey , Mikey , he likes it ! Ready for more ?
NEO: Hell yes !
MORPHEUS: How is he ? Tank looks at his watch , rubs his eyes .
TANK: Ten hours straight . He 's a machine .
NEO: This is incredible . I know Kung Fu .
MORPHEUS: Show me .
MOUSE: Morpheus is fighting Neo ! All at once they bolt for the door .
MORPHEUS: Good . Adaption . Improvisation . But your weakness is n't you technique .
NEO: You You 're too fast .
MORPHEUS: Do you think my being faster , stronger has anything to do with my muscles in this place ?
CABLE: Jeezus Keerist ! That boy is fast !
MOUSE: You ever seen anyone that fast that soon , Tank ?
TANK: Never .
APOC: Morpheus is right . He 's got to be the one .
MOUSE: I do n't believe it !
MORPHEUS: You are angry with me . Neo pants .
NEO: I , uh maybe .
MORPHEUS: It 's all right . It 's natural .
NEO: I feel better .
MORPHEUS: Good , good . Anger is a gift , Neo , ut it 's a heavy one . Morpheus smiles .
NEO: Shit .
CABLE: He 's gon na make it .
APOC: No way . Not possible .
MOUSE: No one 's ever made their first jump .
SWITCH: What if he does ?
APOC: He wo n't .
TANK: It 's never been done .
TRINITY: Come on .
MORPHEUS: Everyone falls the first time . Neo nods quietly .
MOUSE: What does it mean ?
CABLE: It does n't mean anything .
CYPHER: Everyone falls , right , Trinity ? But Trinity has left .
NEO: I thought it was n't real . Neo stares at the blood .
MORPHEUS: The body can not live without the mind .
TRINITY: Neo , I saved you some dinner
CYPHER: Whoa ! Shit , Neo , you scared the ejeezus out of ne .
NEO: Sorry .
CYPHER: No , it 's all right .
NEO: What are you doing ?
CYPHER: Midnight watch .
NEO: Is that ?
CYPHER: The Matrix ? Yeah .
CYPHER,: I 'll be the did n't tell you that this was n't the first time he thought he found the One .
CYPHER: Let me give you a piece of advice . Between you and me , if Morpheus says you can fly , I would n't go jumping out any windows to find out if he 's right . Understand ?
AGENT SMITH: Do we have a deal , Mr. Reagan ?
CYPHER: Mmm , so , so fucking good .
AGENT SMITH: Then we have a deal ?
CYPHER: I do n't want to remember nothing . Nothing ! You understand ? And I want to be rich . Someone important . Like an actor . You can do that , right ?
AGENT SMITH: Whatever you want , Mr. Reagan . Cypher takes a deep drink of wine .
CYPHER: All right . You get my body back in a power plant , reinsert me into the Matrix and I 'll get you what you want .
AGENT SMITH: Access codes to Zion .
CYPHER: I told you , I do n't know them . But I can give you the man who does .
AGENT SMITH: Morpheus .
NEO: Jeez , I was wondering about that .
TANK: What ?
NEO: Why I was bald here but not in the Matrix .
TANK: R.S.I .
NEO: Residual self image .
TANK: Good . Now what 's this ? He points to one of Neo 's monitors .
NEO: Life systems monitor , glucose levels .
TANK: What 's that ?
NEO: Main power supply to the core .
TANK: How about this ?
NEO: Mainframe self-destruct . Uses all emaining power to generate an
TANK: Electromagnetic pulse . Our best weapon against the machines . The problem is if someone is still in the Matrix when that thing goes off , they 're not coming back . Neo nods as Morpheus comes up behind them .
MORPHEUS: How 's he doing ?
TANK: We just finished the operation programs and he 's showing great etention .
MORPHEUS: Good . I want everyone alerted to 12-hour stand-by . We 're going in . Neo , it 's time for you to know why you 're here . Morpheus walks away .
NEO: What 's he talking about ?
TANK: He 's taking you into the Matrix to see her .
NEO: See who ?
TANK: The Oracle .
MORPHEUS: We 're in . He hangs up .
NEO: Did you have to do this ?
TRINITY: Yeah .
NEO: What did she tell you ?
TRINITY: Lots of things .
NEO: Any of them true ? Trinity looks at him , then looks away .
TRINITY: Some of them .
GIZMO: Were they good or bad ?
TRINITY: There 's no point in worrylng . Whatever is going to happen is going to happen .
MORPHEUS: We should be back in an hour .
NEO: The agents . They 're sentient programs . They can commandeer any software hardwired to the mainframe .
MORPHEUS: Anyone that is still in a powe plant . That is why we try to be invisible in the Matrix .
NEO: The best hacking is always traceless .
MOJO: Morpheus , been a long time coming .
MORPHEUS: You 're looking well , Mojo .
MOJO: You bringing us geriatrics now . Morpheus ? He spits and laughs again .
REX: You 're late .
NEO: What what happened ?
MORPHEUS: This is the temple . It is a part of Zion 's mainframe . It 's hidden inside the Matrix so that we can access it .
PRIESTESS: Hello , Morpheus . We 've been expecting you .
MORPHEUS: Okay , you 're on your own . Go with them .
PRIESTESS: Wait here . Among the othe Potentials .
SPOON BOY: Your spoon does not bend because it is just that , a spoon . Mine ends because there is no spoon , just my mind . Neo watches as it curls into a knot .
NEO: There is no spoon . Right .
PRIESTESS: The Oracle will see you now . Spoon Boy smiles .
NEO: Hello ?
ORACLE: Bingo . I got to say I love seeing you non-believers . It 's really a elief . All that pomp and circumstances just plain tucker me out . Almost done . Smell good , do n't they ?
NEO: Yeah .
ORACLE: I 'd ask you to sit down , but you 're not going to anyway . And do n't worry about the vase .
NEO: What vase ?
ORACLE: The vase .
NEO: Shit , I 'm sorry .
ORACLE: I said do n't worry about it . I 'll get one of my kids to fix it .
NEO: How did you know ? She sets the cookie tray on a wooden hot-pad .
ORACLE: What 's really going to bake you noodle later on is , would you still have broken it if I had n't said anything . Smiling , she lights a cigarette .
NEO: Who ?
ORACLE: Not too bright , though . She winks .
NEO: I think so .
ORACLE: So ? What do you think ? You think you 're the one ?
NEO: I do n't know .
ORACLE: You know what that means ? It 's Latin . Means , 'Know thyself . ' She puts her cigarette down .
NEO: What 's the good news ?
ORACLE: Same as the bad news , you 're not the one .
NEO: Is that it , then ?
ORACLE: No . Here . She picks up the tray of cooling cookies .
MORPHEUS: You do n't have to tell me anything , Neo , because I already know what she said .
NEO: You do ?
MORPHEUS: I brought you so that you could hear it for yourself . I knew it would help . Neo finishes his cookie .
TRINITY: Here they come .
TANK: Weird . This area never has this much activity .
MOUSE: Welcome to Movie-Phone .
NEO: Whoa . Deja vu .
TANK: Oh , shit ! Oh , shit !
TRINITY: What did you just say ?
NEO: Nothing . Just had a little deja vu .
TRINITY: What happened ? What did you see ?
NEO: A black cat went past us and then I saw another that looked just like it .
TRINITY: How much like it ? Was it the same cat ?
NEO: It might have been . I 'm not sure .
TRINITY: A deja vu is usually a glitch in the Matrix . It happens when they change something .
TANK: It 's a trap !
MORPHEUS: Come on !
CABLE: Did you just feel something weird ?
MOUSE: Yeah The CELLULAR RINGS .
CABLE: Oh , no . The windows are bricked up .
TANK: No , no , no .
CABLE: Morpheus ! It 's a trap
TRINITY: Oh , God .
CYPHER: That 's what they changed . We 're trapped . There 's no way out .
MORPHEUS: Give me your phone .
TRINITY: They 'll be able to track it .
MORPHEUS: We have no choice .
TANK: Got it .
MORPHEUS: Good . He cuts off the phone .
AGENT SMITH: Eighth floor . They 're on the eighth floor .
AGENT BROWTJ: Eighth floor ! Move !
AGENT BROWN: Where are they ?
COP: They 're in the walls !
AGENT SMITH: Are orders that hard to follow ? I 'll say it again . Morpheus must e taken alive . Understand ?
COP: I got him ! I got him !
MORPHEUS: Come on !
TANK: Nerve gas .
AGENT SMITH: We have them now .
MORPHEUS: You have to get Neo out . Understand ? That 's all that matters now .
TRINITY: Morpheus , do n't
MORPHEUS: He must get out . Do you understand me ? She nods .
COPS: There he is ! That 's him !
COP: He 's heading for the street !
AGENT SMITH: So , we meet at last .
MORPHEUS: And you are ?
AGENT SMITH: Smith . I am Agent Smith .
MORPHEUS: You all look the same to me .
AGENT SMITH: I 've been waiting for this noment .
MORPHEUS: Oh , so have I . Agent Smith smiles .
AGENT SMITH: You ca n't win . Morpheus smiles .
MORPHEUS: I already have .
AGENT SMITH: Take him . Cops swarm over Morpheus .
TANK: No !
AGENT JONES: The others were lost .
AGENT SMITH: You 've taken care of Reagan ? Agent Jones nods .
TRINITY: We need a phone .
TANK: We got ta find the others . They 're still alive . The PHONE RINGS .
CYPHER: There was an accident . A fucking car accident . All of a sudden . Boom . They 're all dead . I still got the shakes but , Jesus , someone 's going to make a believe out of me .
DOZER: There he is .
TANK: I got you .
CYPHER: An actor . Definitely .
TANK: Operator .
TRINITY: We need an exit !
TANK: Got him .
DOZER: System check looks fine .
CYPHER: Goddamn gas . My lungs are killing me . He crosses to an overhead bin .
DOZER: The first aid kit 's over here .
SWITCH: God , I love that sound .
TRINITY: You first , .Neo .
NEO: I do n't know . It just went dead .
TRINITY: Cypher ? Where 's Tank ?
CYPHER: You know , for a long time , I thought I was in love with you , Trinity . I used to dream about you
TRINITY: You killed them .
APOC: What ? !
SWITCH: Oh God .
CYPHER: In a way you 're very lucky . Most people never know why they die . One minute they 're alive , the next they 're dead . No warning . Nothing . That 's why I thought maybe I should tell you . It seemed the least I could do .
TRINITY: What about Zion ?
CYPHER: Zion ? Zion is a part of this delusion . More of this madness . That 's why this has to be done . It has to end . Now and forever . She suddenly sees the entire dark plan .
TRINITY: Oh rny God . This is abzut Zion . You gave them Morpheus for the access codes to Zion .
CYPHER: You see , Trinity , we humans have a place in the future . But it 's not here . It 's in the Matrix .
TRINITY: The Matrix is n't real !
CYPHER: Oh , I disagree , Trinity . I disagree . I think the Matrix is more real than this world . I mean , all I do is pull a plug here . But there , you watch a man die .
TRINITY: Somehow , some way , you 're going to pay for this .
CYPHER: Pay for it ? I 'm not even going to emember it . It 'll be like it never happened . The tree falling in the forest . It does n't make a sound .
TRINITY: Goddamn you , Cypher !
CYPHER: Do n't hate me , Trinity . I 'm just the messenger . And right now I 'm going to prove that the message is true . He stands over Neo .
TANK: How 's it feel , Cypher ? Knowing you 're about to die ?
NEO: It 's Tank ! He 's alive .
TRINITY: We should , we should hurry .
NEO: Yeah . Right .
TRINITY: Tank , you 're hurt .
TANK: I 'll be all right .
TRINITY: Dozer ? Tank 's face tightens .
AGENT JONES: There is a problem . Reagan has failed to secure the hardware . Agent Smith stares out the window .
AGENT SMITH: Never send a human to do a machine 's job .
AGENT JONES: But if Reagan has failed , why have n't they pulled the plug ?
AGENT SMITH: Have n't you learned by now , that it is impossible to understand why they do the things they do ? He turns .
NEO: What are they doing to him ?
TANK: They 're cracking his mind .
NEO: How ?
TANK: They inject virus-like serums to eak down the system . It 's like cracking a computer . All it takes is time .
NEO: How much time ?
TANK: Depends on the mind . But eventually , it will crack and his alpha pattern will change from this to this .
NEO: The access codes to Zion .
TANK: If an agent got inside Zion 's mainframe he could do anything . Disable the defense system . It would be the end of us .
TRINITY: Goddamnit ! Goddamnit !
TANK: We have to pull the plug .
TRINITY: No !
TANK: We do n't have any other choice .
TRINITY: I 'm going in after him .
TANK: Morpheus could conform at any minute
TRINITY: If he does I 'm sure you 'll do what has to be done .
TANK: You saw that place . It 's suicide . She glares at him .
TRINITY: No . No , I do n't think you do . If you did , then you would know that I 'm not letting him go . Not without a fight , Tank . She yanks her harness tight .
AGENT SMITH: Have you ever stood and stared at it , Morpheus ? Marveled at its eauty . Its genius . Billions of people just living out thei lives oblivious .
TRINITY: What do you think you 're doing ?
NEO: You need help . I 'm coming with you .
TRINITY: No . No way . Morpheus sacrificed himself so you could escape . There 's no way you 're going back in .
NEO: Morpheus did what he did because he believed that I 'm something that I 'm not .
TRINITY: What ?
NEO: I 'm not the One , Trinity . The Oracle told me . Trinity is stunned .
TRINITY: Did you tell Morpheus ?
NEO: Why ? It would n't mean anything . He 'd still believe what he wanted to believe . But Morpheus is the one that matters . He 's more important than me and we both know it . He straps in .
TRINITY: What are you ?
NEO: His friend .
AGENT SMITH: I 'd like to share a revelation that I 've had during my time here . It came to me when I tried to classify your species . I 've ealized that you are not actually mammals .
TANK: Okay . Store 's open . What do you need ?
TRINITY: No one has ever done anything like this .
NEO: Yeah ? He snap cocks an Uzi .
AGENT SMITH: Why is n't the serum working ?
AGENT BROWN: Perhaps we are asking the wrong questions .
AGENT JONES: Or he does n't know .
AGENT SMITH: Of course he knows . He 's esisting .
AGENT BROWN: How ?
AGENT SMITH: I do n't know . If I knew
TANK: Hold on , Morpheus . They 're coming for you . They 're coming .
AGENT SMITH: Can you hear me , Morpheus ? I 'm going to be honest with you .
AGENT BROWN: What were you doing ?
AGENT JONES: You do n't know .
AGENT SMITH: Know what ?
AGENT JONES: I think they 're trying to save him .
NEO: There is no spoon .
AGENT JONES: Lower level
AGENT BROWN: They are actually attacking .
AGENT SMITH: Find them and destroy them ! Agent Jones nods and touches his ear piece .
PILOT: I repeat , we are under attack !
NEO: Trinity ! Agent Jones charges .
AGENT JONES: Only human
TRINITY: Dodge this , motherfucker !
NEO: Thanks .
TRINITY: You 're hit
NEO: I 'm fine . Neo is already looking at the helicopter .
TRINITY: Not yet . She pulls out a cellular phone .
TANK: Operator .
TRINITY: Let 's go .
SERGEANT: Sir ! Sir ! There was gunfire we 've lost communication with the oof !
AGENT JONES: Remain at your posts .
SERGEANT: But , sir the fire we should evacuate !
AGENT JONES: You will do as you are ordered !
SERGEANT: Yes , sir .
AGENT SMITH: No .
NEO: Get up , Morpheus ! Get up ! Morpheus sits unmoving , his head still down .
AGENT SMITH: Nooo !
NEO: He wo n't make it . Morpheus lunges , out of control As Neo spins , every move a whip crack
TRINITY: Shit-shit-no !
NEO: Oh fuck .
TANK: He 's the One . He 's got to be
MORPHEUS: I knew it ! I goddamn knew it !
TRINITY: Morpheus !
MORPHEUS: Do you believe me now ? He 's the One ! Who else could have done this ?
NEO: Morpheus , I know you wo n't believe me but the Oracle told ne I 'm not the One .
MORPHEUS: It does n't matter if I do n't elieve you His eyes light up .
TANK: Got one ready . An underground El station . State and Balbo .
AGENT BROWN: The trace was completed .
AGENT JONES: We have their position .
AGENT BROWN: The extermination unit is in place .
AGENT JONES: Order the strike .
AGENT SMITH: They 're not out yet .
NEO: Do n't !
OLD MAN: I 'm sorry I did n't mean !
NEO: Get outta here . Okay ? Run ! Go !
TRINITY: What happened ? Was that
NEO: It was nobody . Neo turns to the RINGING BOOTH .
TRINITY: Morpheus is right , you know . It does n't matter what he believes o even what the Oracle believes . What matters is what you believe .
NEO: I believe He stares at the fullness of her lips .
TRINITY: I want to kiss you too The PHONE begins to RING .
TANK: What the hell just happened ?
TRINITY: An Agent ! You have to send me ack !
TANK: I ca n't !
AGENT SMITH: You 're empty . Neo pulls the TRIGGER . CLICK .
NEO: So are you .
AGENT SMITH: You ca n't win .
NEO: I already have .
TRINITY: Jesus , he 's killing him !
TANK: I 'm looking , Trinity ! I 'm looking !
TRINITY: What is it oh no . In every pipe surrounding them , they see the Extermination Unit .
AGENT SMITH: Do you hear that , Mr. Anderson ?
NEO: My name is Neo .
TRINITY: You ca n't use that until Neo is out !
MORPHEUS: I know . Do n't worry , he 'll make it .
TANK: Operator .
NEO: Hurry , Tank ! I got some serious pursuit !
TRINITY: Neo , you better get your ass back here !
NEO: I 'm trying , Trinity . I 'm trying .
TANK: I 'm going to make the call .
MORPHEUS: Do it !
TRINITY: Where is he ?
TANK: Almost there .
MORPHEUS: He 's going to make it .
TRINITY: Hurry , Neo .
AGENT SMITH: Check him .
TRINITY: No-no-no ! Neo , you 're not dead ! You ca n't be dead !
AGENT BROWN: He 's gone . Agent Smith smiles , standing over him .
AGENT SMITH: I told you , you could n't win .
TRINITY: You 're right here . I 'm holding you , Neo . I 'm not letting you go . Do you hear me ? I wo n't let you go .
AGENT SMITH: Nooooo ! Agent Smith pounds on the elevator door .
TRINITY: Now ! He turns the key .
BOY: Mommy ! Mommy !
MOMMY: What ?
BOY: That man ! That man flies !
MOMMY: Do n't be silly , honey . Men do n't fly .
MAX'S VOICE: Heaven is a place where nothing eve happens .

DOUG: Their wings are golden , the feathers only look black
SGT. ADAMS: You my new guy ?
DETECTIVE: I did n't think anybody was here .
SGT. ADAMS: Everybody 's usually a little late .
SGT. ADAMS: All the cold investigations in the city are collected and delivered over to us . We call each witness to see if they can add anything to their original statement .
DETECTIVE: And if they can ?
SGT. ADAMS: We send the file back to the original precinct for follow-up . Do n't get you hopes up , though .
SGT. ADAMS: Max here handles our filing . Once it hits his desk , a case is officially dead .
SGT. ADAMS: Nope , we do n't do that down here .
DETECTIVE: I do n't understand , then how
SGT. ADAMS: How do you solve that unsolvable murde mystery and redeem yourself ?
DETECTIVE: The grand jury could n't find

BRAVURA: ook at this from my perspective I 've got two bodies in ten body bags . You
AX: And some of that blood is mine . Good luck with your case .
BB: Nice work , detective .
BRAVURA: You 've been around long enough to know I 'm his only way out .
BB: Well , I hope that felt good .
BB: It makes you look guilty . You understand that , right ? Now it 's not just Alex 's unit that thinks you 're the guy
BB: You need friends on the force right now . There 's only so much I can do outside
DETECTIVE #1: Hey !
DETECTIVE #2: God damn it , that means you need a
MAX: There was n't ever a key .
MAX: Lose your dog ?
MONA: We need to talk about my sister .
MAX: hoever killed your sister did the same thing to my partner It was the same person .
MONA: Yeah . You .
MAX: slurred ) So stupid
MONA: You left your wallet lying beside he ody . Who 's stupid ?
MAX: Does that sound like something a Homicide cop would get wrong ?
MONA: Owen Green ?
MAX: Natasha called him on her way out of my apartment . Give me one day to
ONA: No . Now .
MAX: Who is this guy ?
MONA: Somebody my sister used to hang around with . Nice kid .
MONA CONT'D: You better hope he backs your story up .
MAX: I have things I need to ask him , myself .
MONA: Owen , open up .
MAX: Owen ?
OWEN: Help me .
MONA: Owen ?
MAX: Owen , wait
OWEN: Make them stop , tell them I ca n't fly
MONA: What did we just see ?
MAX: You 're sure this is the place ?
MONA: Natasha had all her work done here .
ARTIST: Something I can help you with ?
MAX: What if I wanted this tattoo ?
TATTOO ARTIST: Then you 're probably in the Marine Corps .
MAX: This one .
MONA: What is it ?
TATTOO ARTIST: It 's a Norse superstition . The Vikings used to wear them for protection .
MONA: Trust me , my sister had all the guardian angels she needed .
TATTOO ARTIST: Not angels . Valkyries .
TATTOO ARTIST: In Norse mythology , the only way you get to go to heaven is to die in violence . Die in your sleep , you go to hell . Valkyries fly over the battlefields , picking out the righteous dead . They eward the people who draw first blood . A soldier 's angel .
MONA: Where 's home ?
TATTOO ARTIST: Some club down in Alphabet City .
MAX: Protection from what ?
MONA: Do you know this guy ?
MAX: You think they were both on something ?
MONA: Crystal meth , maybe , some amphetamine that raises your body temperature in an overdose . Explains why they were both sweating like that , trying to cool off . Of course , a junky wo n't usually jump out the window if there 's someone left in the oom to beg or rob .
MAX: You were standing right beside me .
MONA: And ?
MAX: Jumped is not the word I 'd use .
MONA: They all look
MAX: Like Owen .
MAX: No
BB: It was sitting at this very table that your father told me I needed to retire . For about a minute , I just sat here thinking about knocking him out of his chair . The job was everything to me , to the point that I could n't see the writing on the wall - what it was doing to my marriage , my health . Your old man knew if I was going to listen to reason , it B could only happen in here .
MAX: I watched a guy throw himself out of a window tonight . The things he was saying-
BB: Any guy who throws himself out a window , I would n't pay any attention to the things he said .
MAX: The problem is , I knew what he was talking about .
BB: And you are now ?
MAX: There 's something going on , and I ca n't find a rational explanation for it .
MAX CONT'D: There'ssomething out there , hurting people
BB: Okay , calm down .
MAX: It 's real . I 'm not crazy .
BB: Then stop acting like it . Max , you 're eaking into offices , I.A . is all ove you , you wo n't even show up for work
MAX: The night Alex died , there was something else in the room with us . I saw it .
MAX: It 's the same thing these people are seeing right before they die . I think Michelle saw it , too .
BB: For God 's sake , do n't drag her into this .
MAX: Alex found something out about what happened to her . Something new .
MAX: He was trying , right before he died
BB: Listen , okay ? Why do n't you come back with me , let Beth make up the guest room for you . Just for tonight .
MAX: It 's real .
ATTENDANT: You riding ?
VINNIE: In or out , asshole .
MONA: We need to talk . Talk .
VINNIE: Shut the door , then . You Ruskies may be used to it , but I 'm freezing my dick off over here .
VINNIE: Okay . So talk .
MONA: Something was taken from me . It involves a club in Italian territory , so I need your blessing to go make it right .
MONA: I said ` blessing . '
VINNIE: Oh . Well , blessing might cost extra . Which club are we talking about ?
MONA: Ragna Rok .
VINNIE: Yeah , I know . Sure , fine . You have my permissionblessing , whatever .
MONA: You do still control that block , right ? It 's south of
VINNIE: The guy 's name is Jack Lupino .
MONA: Well , that sounds Italian to me .
VINNIE: He 's no kind of Italian I 've ever seen . Tattooed freak , a real sicko from what we hear .
ONA: You 're afraid of tattoos , now ?
VINNIE: When the club first opened , I sent somebody down to collect theyou know , fire insurance . A day goes by , and I do n't see him . Then I get two boxes delivered to me . One box 's got my guy 's hands and ears in it . The other box has a quarter of a million dollars in cash .
MONA: This neighborhood has been your family 's forever . Two-fifty large is all it takes to
VINNIE: What got my attention , Mona , was that the oxes were delivered by a cop car . A guy in uniform hands them to me in broad daylight . I 'm not scared of tattoos , or freaks , o mouthy Russian bitches . But whoever 's watching over Lupino , whoever it is you eally need to bless you walking inside Ragna Rokhim , I am scared of .
MAX: Michelle !
JUNKIE: It 's okay . They 're angels , now .
MAX: Michelle !
MAX: Michelle
BRAVURA: I 'm listening .
BB: This is n't just some job stress freak- out . This is a man who lost everything , and who deserves a little understanding from the rest of us . If you 'd known him efore You 'd want to believe him , too .
BRAVURA: Believe him about what ?
BB: Absolutely not . Alex was his partner , they were like brothershe could n't have . There 's no way .
BRAVURA: Then what are we talking about ?
BB: Look , Max is like a son to me . Do n't put me in a position to have to hang him . But you should hear the kinds of things he 's sayinghallucinations , none of it makes any sense to me . I 'm worried he 's going to get into another situation efore I can convince him to come in .
BB: I 'm telling you to find him tonight , efore somebody else gets hurt .
BRAVURA: Bringing him in wo n't be a problem . Where I need your help will be his
RAVURA: A New Jersey unit ID 'd him near his old house . It should n't be long .
BB: You have to find him first , protect him . Some of the guys from Alex 's unit beat you to him , they wo n't wait for a trial .
MAX: Okay , Chelle . Help me , here
AX: Relax , I 'm a cop .
YOUNG COP: Do n't move ! I know who you are .
MAX: Just relax . I need you to trust me for a minute
YOUNG COP: Yeah ? Is that what you said to you partner ?
MAX: You do n't understand .
YOUNG COP: Lay down on your face .
MAX: Okay , just take it easy .
YOUNG COP: Word 's gotten around about the sick shit you did to him , too . If I were you , I 'd get ready for sort of a long ride back into the city
COLVIN: We have a problem .
MAX: Subjects ?
CONDUCTOR: Ladies and gentlemen , please remain calm . The storm 's caused a power failure , but it 's absolutely nothing to worry about . We 'll be up and running again before long .
MAX: Get out of the train .
BB: Max ? What are you doing ?
BB: Those grunts who went crazy in Iraq ?
AX: Go a little further , read what they did to the bodies . It 's the same as what happened to Alex and that girl .
MAX: Michelle .
AX: Somebody at Aesir knows what
BB: Oh , my God .
MAX: What are you talking about ?
BB: He came to me about six months ago , asking about one of the executives at Aesir . At the time I had no reason to connect it to Michelle , I just thought I tried to warn him , this guy has connections to some scary people
MAX: Who ? What 's his name ?
BB: Jason Colvin . He used to be the head of the pharmaceutical division , but he 's moved up over the last few years . I guess Michelle probably reported directly to him
HOMICIDE COP: Looks like ten bodies , give or take . Even in New York , that ought to be enough to earn Payne the spike .
BRAVURA: The blast point is outside the train .
HOMICIDE COP: He forced them to stop , first .
BRAVURA: So he had the bomb with him inside , but he decided to walk outside to detonate it ?
HOMICIDE COP: Are you asking if that seems like odd ehavior from a guy who cut his partner 's head off ?
OUNG COP: You wanted to see me ?
HOMICIDE COP: Careful what you say to him , if you eve want to make detective
YOUNG COP: I already filled out a report .
BRAVURA: Show me where it happened , then .
YOUNG COP: He jumped out and wrapped that cord around me , and before I had a chance
BRAVURA: He was coming out of here ?
HOMICIDE COP: Hey , real cops are working here
BRAVURA: Where 's the stuff you guys moved ?
CSI TECH: Nothing 's been moved .
HOMICIDE COP: What , you playing detective now ?
BRAVURA: spent four hours up at Homicide going through Alex 's desk and cataloging pictures of this woman , and not one of you bastards bothered to mention that she was Max Payne 's wife ?
HOMICIDE COP: If Alex was getting a little something on the side
BRAVURA: Who are you protecting ?
HOMICIDE COP: Nobody , we justwhy would anybody talk to IA without a reason ?
BRAVURA: You 've got a reason , now . Tell me everything you know about this woman , starting with her name .
COLVIN: You should go on home , already . There 's nothing going on today
RECEPTIONIST: Well , there 's someone in your office
MAX: This your daughter ?
COLVIN: Yes , it is . Three years old .
AX: You can tell me about Project Valhalla .
COLVIN: I think you might have the wrong
MAX: eed to make a call ?
COLVIN: Maybe I 'd better .
AX: She was my wife .
COLVIN: Excuse me ?
MAX: Michelle Payne was my wife .
COLVIN: What
MAX: Before you say anything else , I want you to know who I am .
COLVIN: Please , wait
BRAVURA: I need to talk to somebody about a woman who used to work here .
COLVIN: Please do n't hit me again .
MAX: ut it was n't the universe that took my family away from me .
COLVIN: There is no
MAX: Tell me .
COLVIN: There 's no Project Valhalla anymore . I shut it down years ago .
COLVIN: Nobody knows what happened to her .
OLVIN: terrified ) People thought Michelle might be a whistle-blower . That she was n't loyal enough to Aesir , and she might go public about the program .
GUARD: Authorized personnel only .
BRAVURA: Do n't look at him . Move aside .
COLVIN: Why are you asking me about this ?
MAX: I already told you . Be quiet , now .
COLVIN: But why today ? It 's over , I got rid of everything before they moved me out of the division
MAX: Then you have n't been Downtown lately , ecause you missed a spot .
COLVIN: Are you telling me that there are people out there taking the drug again ? urgent ) How many of them ?
MAX: What are you talking about ?
COLVIN: Show that to whoever will watch . If this thing spreads , nothing will keep the rest of you safe .
MAX: Back up , all of you . Make a path .
BRAVURA: This is Jim Bravura , IA . You need to tell the units responding to the Aesi call to come equipped for automatic The Aesir building , nobody 's called anything in yet ? Hell yes , I 'd like to report something . We 've got machine gun fire in Midtown .
BRAVURA: Put your hands up !
MAX: She was trying to stop it .
BRAVURA: Stop what ? Tell me what 's happening
BRAVURA: NYPD ! Hold your fire !
MONA: That 's the guy .
MAX: What are you talking about ?
MONA: He 's the one behind Ragna Rok . It 's his club where the drug 's being sold .
ONA: So what do we do now ?
MONA: What are you doing ? Uncuff me . Hey !
MAX: He killed my wife .
MONA: I 've been inside that club . You do n't have a chance on your own . But you do n't care .
MONA: I hope that 's really the way it works .
GUARD #1: All quiet , 4 a.m .

MAX: Who is your contact at Aesir ?
MAX: ou do n't know what I 'm talking about , do you ?
LUPINO: The angels are not done with you yet .
AX: What 's going on here , BB ?
MAX: Hey !
JOE SALLE: Now ?
BB: Not unless you feel like carrying him out of here . Max knows me , and I definitely do n't know Mr. Lupino .
MAX: shouting ) Look at me , BB . At least face what you 're doing
BB: row up .
BB: She had no right to put me in that situation . Asking me to pass up this kind of an opportunity to help her rat out my bossesI 'm sorry , but that 's unreasonable .
MAX: No . Just better than you .
BB: For what it 's worth , he did n't know Michelle was going to die .
BB: I 'd arranged with the other guys to finish the job .
BB: You really did n't know ?
AX: You should have killed me then , when you had a chance .
BB: I learned something from your father , years ago . Always give people a choice .
BB CONT'D: You could have put a gun in your mouth any time you wanted . Or , you could have kept living in the hell I made for you . That 's your choice .
BB: Just out of curiosity , though why do n't I have a chance now ?
MAX: Because now I know it 's you .
BB: Well , you 're
JOE SALLE: Okay , enough . This is far enough .
JOE SALLE: BB

JOHNNY BOY: We 'll get some food from my aunt 's . I 'll get in through the fire escape . She 's always got something .
CHARLIE: Do n't do that . You 'll scare Teresa if you try to sneak in .
JOHNNY BOY: Yeahyou 're right . Maybe she 'll have a seizure and we can watch .
CHARLIE: That 's not funny . You gon na be a jerk-off all your life . Grow up . You want something to eat from you aunt 's house you go knock on he door , understand ?
JOHNNY BOY: I 'm not hungry anymore . I 'm going to bed .
TERESA: I 'd like to eat something before I go back to work .
CHARLIE: Ok , we 'll go for lunch .
TERESA: Do you have enough ? CHARLIE checks his wallet .
CHARLIE: Wellwith the hotel that 's ten fifteen
TERESA: Here . She hands him a few bills . He hesitates .
CHARLIE: Well
TERESA: I do n't mind . She puts the money into his hand .
CHARLIE: Sureit 's not thatI mean
TERESA: It 's all right .
CHARLIE: Well , if things go the way I hope they 'll go , this money business will take care of itself .
ASIDE: God willing .
TERESA: An apartment uptown ? Downtown ?
CHARLIE: Maybe , who knows .
TERESA: Charlie ?
CHARLIE: Nobody knows anything , believe me . She kisses him gently .
TERESA: Anything specific ?
CHARLIE: You knowlike restaurants , night clubs
TERESA: What is it now ?
CHARLIE: Do n't ask .
TERESA: Alright Hey , did you hear any more about what happened last night ?
CHARLIE: Did you ?
TERESA: No .
CHARLIE: CHRIST , you should have seen it . Unbelievable . The kid would turn around and fire and he would just keep coming at him like Rasputin . That kid was scared . Not half as much as we were though .
TERESA: It does n't make any sense . He would n't shoot him just because he insulted a racket guynot unless it was personal .
CHARLIE: You missed the point . The kid 's a climbernot very brightbut if you get down to his level to look at it his way ; he kills a guy who insulted a big man - he gets a eputation . He thinks he 's in good standing .
TERESA: It 's still sick .
CHARLIE: Not sickjust stupid . Speaking of stupid , your cousin last night was feeling so good he decided to eak into your mother 's houseto get some food .
TERESA: You 're sure he does n't know . He takes her in his arms .

CHARLIE: Ok , how 's everything going ? OSCAR sits down next to CHARLIE .
OSCAR: Do n't askdo you have any idea what I 've been doing all morningeh ?
CHARLIE: No .
OSCAR: I was in the basement fixing the pipes . Would you believe that ?
CHARLIE: What pipes ?
OSCAR: What pipesthe ones from last yearthose pipes . CHARLIE shakes his head in sympathy .
CHARLIE: That bad , huh ?
OSCAR: I ca n't make this week 's payment and if this keeps up not next week 's either .
CHARLIE: Not next week 's eitherlistenyou tell that to Giovanni , not me .
OSCAR: Listen , I should wrap up this place in a ribbon and hand it to him , you know that . I do n't need this aggravation . I 'm getting old .
CHARLIE: He 'd rather have the loan payed , you know that .
OSCAR: Your Uncle 's a good manI wo n't stick him . Either he gets the money or the place and right now he 's getting the place . And tell me why should I care ? I got a partner who 's a bum , who does n't help outwho disappears and leaves me with all the problems . I should go back to FloridaI do n't need this .
CHARLIE: I do n't understand , where 's Groppi ?
OSCAR: I should know ? His wife do n't even know . Probably off with one of his little girlsI do n't know . I tell you , if he do n't give a damn , then I do n't give a damnWhy should I kill myself ?
CHARLIE: My uncle figured that this week was adbut about next weekI dunno . Maybe you should speak to him yourself .
OSCAR: What can I say ?
CHARLIE: Is my uncle back there ? CHARLIE points in the direction of a doorway .
REPAIR MAN: Yeah , but I think he 's busy now . Hey Charlie play 463 today - fo sure .

SECURITY: Sorry , got ta do this
BISHOP: I like the new digs .
MCKENNA: Has it really been that long ? Jesus .
BEAT: You know how they say youth is lost on the young ? They 're right . If I had my nineteen year old body back , I would n't be here , I 'll tell you that . I 'd be out there , making it my personal life mission to bang every stewardess who ever dared put on one of those whatchamacallit skirts .
BISHOP: Times have changed , Harry . They do n't wear skirts anymore .
MCKENNA: You know what all that is ? That 's their money , getting moved , exchanged . Made clean and neat and proper for Uncle Sam . And I have always been extremely careful .
BISHOP: And
MCKENNA: And ? And that 's the point ! Nothing . I tell them they have a problem here and instead of dealing with it I get silence , zippo , fuck- all . What are they , twelve ?
BISHOP: I do n't see how I can
MCKENNA: That 's bullshit , Arthur . You father they still talk about the guy like he walked on water . You , they 'll listen to . You
BISHOP: I 'm not a part of that .
MCKENNA: You remember that fishing trip we all took , back in the day . You were , what ? About eight , right ? You fell out of the boat could n't swim a stroke . City kid . You 're in the water , splashing around .
BEAT: Anyway , the whole time you 're in the water , you did n't cry out . Not once . You were a tough sonofabitch , even then .
BISHOP: That was a long time ago , Harry .
MCKENNA: Well , I 'm in the water this time , Arthur . You think it 's easy for me to ask ? It cuts like hell . But that 's what I 'm doing .
TO STEVE: Steve , this is Arthur Bishop .

STEVE: Thirty thousand . You know , I ca n't tell what you 're thinking , Mr. Bishop . Usually , I 'm very good with that , with people . Sort of like a bullshit detector I developed . But you 're very hard to read .
BISHOP: Sorry .
STEVE: Do n't be . So what are you thinking ?
BISHOP: I was thinking that a son , should e more grateful to his father .
NODDING: I agree . I agree . I often wonde why I 'm not .
MCKENNA: There . Now go away .
STEVE: Thank you , dad . Are we going to see you at the house any time soon ?

BEAT: No , it 's going to be okay now . Arthur 's helping me out .
STEVE: Well it 's good to meet you Mr. Bishop . My father seems to trust you , which is unusual .
MCKENNA: We will take from our children fo a lifetime what we would not suffe from another man for an instant . Explain that to me . Okay . Okay , call me when you hea something .
BISHOP: You take care of yourself , Harry .
MCKENNA: Well , that 's your job now , is n't it ?
ART DEALER: Arthur . Glad you 're here . Right this way .
BISHOP: No .
WOMAN'S VOICE: Good evening , Mr. Bishop . How can I help you ?
BISHOP: Yes . I 'd like to speak to Dean . There 's a brief pause on the phone , then .
WOMAN'S VOICE: Mr. Dean is not available right now . Can I take a message ?
BISHOP: No . Just tell him I called . Bishop hangs up , stares at the phone .

MCKENNA'S VOICE: Thank you , Arthur .
BISHOP: I 'm sorry . My bad .
SECURITY #2: Hey , you okay ?
SECURITY #1: Actually , call central . I 'm not
MCKENNA: You ever wonder what the last day of your life will feel like , Arthur ?
BISHOP: You keep standing next to that window , maybe you 'll be able to tell me .
MCKENNA: This turns out alright , I 'm going to send you a dozen Thai hookers and a case of Cuban Esplandidos . You can return the hookers if you want , but the cigars
SMILING: I do n't smoke .
MCKENNA: You will , my friend . For these , you will .
BISHOP: Why the change of security ?
MCKENNA: What ?
BISHOP: Come on
MCKENNA: This is n't good , Arthur

BISHOP: My condolences .
NODS: Yeah , Harry was a popular guy . Good to see so many of his friends here . Touching .
BISHOP: Looks like you have one .
STEVE: Yeah , all of that . Empty limos . Fake guests . All so that the papers print what an important and espected man Harry was .
BISHOP: Your dad worked with my father a long time ago .
STEVE: So ?
BISHOP: So , just paying my respects .
STEVE: So your old man was into all that ?
SMALL NOD: Yeah , he was into all that .
STEVE: Well , that is refreshingly honest , Mr. Bishop . What about you ?
BEAT: Come on in , meet the crowd .
BISHOP: No , thanks . I 've got to
STEVE: Please . A favor to me . None of these people even remembered what today was .
BISHOP: Why ?
STEVE: I think maybe we 're all doomed to ecome our fathers . I 'll probably die spoiled , corrupt , lonely and alone . Runs in the blood . What would that make you ?
BISHOP: You 're still young . You can do pretty much whatever you please .
STEVE: You think so ? Just chuck all this and go help the children in South America , something like that ?
BISHOP: Maybe .
STEVE: Well look at you , Mr. Bishop . You 're a dreamer . Steve heads inside . A beat , Bishop follows .
BEAUTY #1: Well ? Do you want to ?
STEVE: No , in fact I 'm pretty sure that 's illegal in this state .
TO BISHOP: Come on , this way .
STEVE: You know , I went up there . To where my father died .
BISHOP: Oh ?
STEVE: Hell of a place to die . Lonely
BISHOP: That all yours ?
STEVE: If the body is weak , the mind ca n't e strong .
FRIEND: She 's up in the bungalow . I think she might really do it this time .
TO BISHOP: My girlfriend thinks that my father 's death is a good time to kill herself . She thinks I 'm not showing the appropriate human eaction .
BISHOP: I 'll let myself out .
STEVE: No , please . You 've seen this much . Are n't you interested ? I am . Off Bishop
LOUISE: Who 's he ?
STEVE: A friend . Would have thought you 'd have started by now .
LOUISE: This is n't about me . It 's about you . You need to watch .
STEVE: Okay . I 'm here . I 'm watching .
LOUISE: You do n't believe I 'll do it .
STEVE: No , I know you , Louise . You 'll do just about anything if it 'll get you enough attention .
LOUISE: You think you can hide behind that cool attitude . Like nothing matters to you . But I know you . You care . You feel .
STEVE: Do I ?
LOUISE: How long will it take ?
HE SHRUGS: Mr. Bishop ? Bishop rises , looks down at her in the tub .
BISHOP: How much do you weigh ?
LOUISE: A hundred and ten .
BISHOP: You 're a hundred and twenty-five . It 'll take an hour and a half , maybe two . When you get cold then you 'll know you 're close .
LOUISE: He 'll stop it . He thinks he 's above it all . But he 's not . No one is .
FROM INSIDE: Steve ! Steve ! I know you feel this . I know you 'll stop me .
CALLING BACK: If you do n't care anything about your life , why should I ?
LOUISE: I 'm getting cold . Please . I 'm frightened . I 'm scared , Steve .
STEVE: You can help her if you want .
LOUISE: You 're a bastard .
STEVE: You know what the kick of it is , Louise ? If you actually had the stones , then there 's be something for us . But in 30 seconds when you un down that path and all of those people go crazy saving your life Well , then we 'll be done .
BEAT: I know . Catch-22 . Life 's not fair .
REALIZING: What happened to you ?
STEVE: Maybe nothing . Maybe you neve eally knew me .
LOUISE: You 're a bastard , too . Both of you . Like looking in some dark mirror .
STEVE: Go on , Louise . You 'll do fine . The world 's gon na love you .
BISHOP: Would you have let her do it ?
STEVE: We 'll never know , will we ? Steve rises , heads up a small path .
BISHOP: You did n't answer my question .
STEVE: Everybody dies .
BISHOP: Sure . But it 's a whole other world when you 're personally involved . There 's a very big tab that has to e picked up .
STEVE: Such as ?
BISHOP: Governments , cops , the military we give young men a licence and send them into it blind , thinking it 'll all be okay . Because someone told them they had permission .
BEAT: But when you cross over that line , you do it alone . Most people , they stay that way from then on . Alone .
STEVE: Everybody can kill . You take a mother , protecting her child
BISHOP: Sure . But that 's instinct . What I 'm talking about is up here Knowledge of foresight . Intention . A person who knows that the only way to truly be free of man 's laws , is to break his highest one . Beat . It sits there , between them .
STEVE: Why are you telling me all this ?
BISHOP: Why did you want me to see that little stunt with your girlfriend ?
STEVE: You know , you 're right . You grow up spoiled , rich , like me Only thing you really learn to recognize in people is when someone wants something from you .
BEAT: What do you want , Mr. Bishop ? What are you doing here ? Bishop considers Steve , thrown . Then
BISHOP: Thanks for the tour . It 's been interesting .
STEVE: Yes , it has .
FEMALE DOCTOR: Quite a collection you have here . Military ?
BISHOP: Something like that .
FEMALE DOCTOR: Does this hurt ?
BISHOP: Yes , a little .
FEMALE DOCTOR: Any next of kin , anybody we can notify ? How about an acquaintance ?
BISHOP: Am I going to die ?
SMILE: No , not today . Bishop reaches for his shirt , slips it on .
STEVE: Mr. Bishop ! Arthur ! Please , I need to speak with you .
BISHOP: What time is it ?
STEVE: I wan na show you something . Please . It 'll be It 'll be interesting .
BISHOP: Gon na tell me what the big surprise is ?
STEVE: I 'd rather show you . I know , melodramatic . But I think it 'll be worth it to you .
CAREFUL: Maybe it 's time you start talking .
STEVE: You know what that says ? My dad did n't die of a heart attack . I mean , he was dying of a heart attack , but that 's not what killed him . The blood flow to his brain was cut off , his brain died before his body . Somebody killed him . On Bishop , considering Steve .
BISHOP: What do the police think ?
LAUGHING: The police ? They do n't want to hear about this . I mean , they 'll look into it . But they do n't very much like the idea that they totally missed this one and it 'd be just easier for everyone if I would shut the hell up .
BISHOP: What do you want ?
STEVE: They killed him . Here , on the roof of his own building . His own security all around . Why here ? Why even kill him , if he was already dying ?
BISHOP: You tell me .
STEVE: To make a point . That no one 's safe . That they can get to anyone , whenever they want to .
BISHOP: So what am I doing here ?
STEVE: I got my black belt in Karate when I was nineteen . I 've studied Judo since I was six .
BISHOP: I 'm impressed .
STEVE: No , you 're not . Most people are , ut you 're not . If I came at you ight now , I 'd wind up dead as my father , would n't I ?
BEAT: Something you could teach me .
BISHOP: I did n't get the impression you even liked Harry very much .
STEVE: You really going to stand there and judge how much I loved my father ? What the hell do you know about it ? Bishop , hearing this . A nerve touched .
BISHOP: You want revenge .
STEVE: You know the word `` Nemesis '' ? It 's not actually a word . It 's a name . She was one of the Greek goddesses . Of anger . Retribution against any mortal who became too proud .
BISHOP: Justice ?
CALLING AFTER: Fine . Fine . In case you have n't noticed , I now have a couple of million dollars to spend on this , so I will find them myself and I 'll deal with them myself and if I wind up dead trying , you can bury me ight next to dear old dad
BISHOP: Jesus , stop your whining .
STEVE: I wo n't .
BISHOP: And Steve no more surprises like this , okay ?
STEVE: The psychopath has no motive .
BISHOP: No , he 's driven , compelled , by his sickness . He 's as much the victim as those he kills . More drapes fall . Dead eyes stare up at them .
STEVE: I understand .
BISHOP: Do you ? This is n't some idea anymore . This is the real thing . You still with me ?
STEVE: I am .
BISHOP: Ever heard the term `` Mechanic '' used outside of its normal meaning ?
STEVE: My father used it . A dealer a guy who works the tables . Bishops smiles , shakes his head .
BISHOP: What are you thinking ?
STEVE: I had you pegged as a security consultant . Maybe ex-military . Someone who protects people .
BISHOP: Maybe I do .
STEVE: Or maybe you just get paid to kill people . Bishop nods his head yes .
BISHOP: Times are changing . Security is etter trained , more lethal . Sometimes I could use a partner .
STEVE: Bullshit .
BISHOP: In this there is n't room fo those who are outside of it . There 's too much isolation . Friendships ca n't work . Eventually everyone expects you to account . The isolation becomes a liability . You stand out . Standing out is n't good . Steve smiles , shakes his head .
STEVE: You need a friend ?
BISHOP: An associate .
BEAT: I 'm offering to teach you something that most people ca n't be taught .
STEVE: Because you think I 'm a natural .
BISHOP: That remains to be seen . But you 're alone in there , are n't you ? That 's the prerequisite .
STEVE: Bishop
BEAT: When I find the men who murdered my father . You help me to kill them .
BISHOP: You may never find them .
STEVE: You did n't answer my question . A beat . Bishop nods .
BISHOP: Too fast .
STEVE: I know . I 'm working on it .
BISHOP: You were still over 100 .
STEVE: What am I supposed to do ?
BISHOP: There are no perfect situations . You fought me at 100 % , so you were winning . But in doing so , you gave up your shooting option .
BEAT: It 's all about choices . Always . Bishop starts to leave .
STEVE: Bishop What 's your 100 % look like ? Bishop smiles .
BISHOP: You lost control .
STEVE: You think ?
BISHOP: Sometimes .
STEVE: Why do n't you ?
BISHOP: I have responsibilities . I have a cat .
STEVE: You know , looking at these , a person might think maybe there 's a screw or two loose up there
SHAKING NO: Do n't be so eager . Open it .
STEVE: Who 's the Mark ?
BISHOP: I am .
OWNER: Interest you in anything ?
BISHOP: That 's a beauty .
BEAMING: You know your instruments
SALESMAN: They do n't make that anymore . That 's a classic . I can let you have it for three hundred
BISHOP: Good . Very good .
STEVE: Good ? That 's all you got ? How about God damn perfect , man ?
BISHOP: Do n't get cocky .
STEVE: Broad daylight . A thousand witnesses . Man takes a wrong step . Excuse me if I take a moment to appreciate myself . Because that was poetry . You just ca n't bring yourself to be impressed , can you ?
BISHOP: All right . You did very well .
STEVE: Damn straight I did . And now , in celebration of me , I 'm taking you to a restaurant where the waitresses what ?
BISHOP: There 's a man behind me . Look up once , then look away . Do n't look ack .
STEVE: Yeah . Look
BISHOP: You did good here . Really good . But this was just a game . That man is your graduation .
STEVE: Who is he ?
BISHOP: He owns the watch store .
STEVE: I know . I meant what did he do ? Bishop comes close , FOCUSED .
BISHOP: I 've taught you how to kill without anyone knowing there was a murder . I 've taught you to be invisible . But that 's strategy , not killing . The real test it 's the actual killing , is n't it ?
STEVE: Bishop
BISHOP: Do you want this ? Be very sure . Because you can walk away .
STEVE: No . I 'm ready . Bishop studies him nods . Turns to go .
BISHOP: School 's out .
FROM INSIDE: It 's open !
WOMAN'S VOICE: I 'll just be a minute .
BISHOP: It 's for a friend .
WOMAN'S VOICE: Do n't be .
WOMAN: You know who I saw yesterday ?
BEAT: Bradley Fliescher . He and Ginny have this little cottage up the coast they hardly use . I was thinking , maybe next week you and I should go . Approaching , handing him a wine .
QUIET: Do you know what I dreamed ? I dreamed you and I had a child
WOMAN: I know , it 's crazy . I do n't want to pin you down . I know you need your freedom . I just sometimes I miss you so much He 's staring at her , oddly .
BEAT: I 'm sorry , Bishop . It wo n't happen again .
NODDING: It 's okay . Really . It 's okay .
WEAKLY: Who are you ?
WOMAN: Hey , Bishop . You okay ?
BISHOP: Do you remember , what you wanted to e , when you were a little girl ? She hears it , it wounds her . Looks down .
WOMAN: No , it 's okay . I wanted to be a Marine Biologist . I used to watch those Jaques Cousteau movies and just dream .
BISHOP: What happened ?
BEAT: I was beautiful .
BISHOP: We all got ta make a living .
SOPHIE: Thank you , thank you ! Bishop ! Mom !
BISHOP: I saw that in a I 'm sorry , I probably should have asked .
GROCER: Do n't worry about it , Bishop . You have a good night .
BISHOP: Go ahead .
STEVE: Are you surprised to see me ?
BEAT: It was sitting there , right in front of my face , was n't it ? Bishop does n't respond .
BISHOP: There 's a code , to what we do . It may not be rational , but it matters . The man 's name was Harry Xiao . He was a Mechanic . Last year a US Representative died in a fire along with his wife and two children .
STEVE: Bishop !
BISHOP: Civilian casualties are very effective at hiding intent , but there 's a line -
STEVE: I do n't give a damn about that ! You have n't answer my question Did he kill my father ? Bishop does n't react , then
BISHOP: You should put that behind you now .
STEVE: I could have died today !
BISHOP: You did n't .
STEVE: Blind fucking luck ! Look at me ! You tried to kill me ! That man was he was unstoppable .
BISHOP: But you stopped him .
STEVE: Fuck you ! You sonofabitch ! Give me one good reason I do n't blow you away right now ! ONE GOD DAMN
BISHOP: Now I 'm sorry if you got a little scared . But this is n't coaching girl 's softball , is it ? This is life or death . Every time you go into this , somebody dies .
STEVE: Bishop . Those things they do n't mean anything to me . This , makes sense . I do n't know why . But I think I was meant to do this .
BEAT: And like you said , you could use someone .
BISHOP: We should all be so lucky .
STEVE: Bishop Nemesis . Devine Retribution . What did she do ? Beat . Unsaid questions asked , unanswered .
BISHOP: Work it again .
STEVE: She never leaves . It 's like they know we 're coming .
BISHOP: Maybe they do .
STEVE: Falls off the rooftop .
BISHOP: Falls or jumps ?
SMILING: I tell you one thing , killing he is not the first thing that jumps to mind what ?
BISHOP: Nothing . I 'm going for a run . You wan na come ?
STEVE: Let me ask you something . You eve not feel like running 5 miles ?
BISHOP: Always made me feel understood .
BEAT: Come on .
BISHOP: The Mark is a beautiful woman . Before arriving at her current position , she enjoyed the way men looked at her . That 's gone now . She needs to be taken seriously . She hates that men only see the eauty . Magazines , heads of state , all focusing how what a piece of tail she was . Like you did .
STEVE: He ca n't see her .
BISHOP: He ca n't see her . Neither of them can . Beat . PHONE RINGS . Bishop snaps it up .
STEVE: Patrol number three moves down the service corridor at 18 50 . Five minute window after to make it up top . Three minute climb to position . That 's 18 54 . Three minute window to engage . Shake , stir , add lime and enjoy . Bishop smiles , looks away .
BISHOP: This business , it 's not like there 's a degree you can go get . It 's like most trades , it gets passed down .
BEAT: A man told his girlfriend , to impress her . The girlfriend told some people she owned money to Bishop finishes his glass of water .
STEVE: You ever wish you just walked away ? Let it go ?
BISHOP: Sure . Every day . But I was n't wired that way .
BEAT: What about you ?
SECURITY: Fire in the restaurant . Patrols two and five , we 're closing down the front entrance .
SECURITY PRO: Excuse me , 'mam . There 's a fire next door , nothing to worry about .
STEVE: Hey ! You need to get out ! Whole uilding is going up !
BISHOP: Ready ?
STEVE: How did it go
BISHOP: Not yet .
STEVE: Alright , you got ta admire that . You got ta admit , we are a spooky good team
BISHOP: Duck
STEVE: It was my fault . I was in charge of the exit . I looked at every work order , every entry in the building logs
BISHOP: No one controls 100 % That 's the nature of the beast .
STEVE: You 're bleeding .
BISHOP: Yup .
STEVE: So back there . That was one hundred percent ? Bishop looks over , gives nothing . Tiny smile .
BISHOP: That one is for a special moment . Have n't found it yet .
STEVE: You have n't found the Are you kidding ? You have to what ?
BISHOP: This could get interesting .

BISHOP: Why 'd you kill those other people ?
STEVE: You really going moral high ground on me ? Seriously ? You might want to check your soapbox there , partner .
CALLING OUT: But that 's the difference between us , is n't it ? You 're all alone , ut you still like people . You wish they liked you . Whereas I have people everywhere and all I ever want , is to be alone . Steve hears BANGING coming from the barn .

DREW: Well , it 's a big day . Wanted to line up a few ducks before kickoff . Any thoughts ? Last minute refine- ments or variations ?
PARRISH: 'Thoughts ' ? Not a one but I did hear a voice last night .
DREW: A voice ?
PARRISH: In my sleep .
DREW: What 'd it say ?
PARRISH: 'Yes ' .
DREW: 'Yes ' to the deal ?
PARRISH: Maybe , who knows ? You know how voices are . Let 's go . Quince comes running up now .
QUINCE: Hi , Bill

PARRISH: Not my birthday again ?
SUSAN: You 're only six-five once .
PARRISH: Thank God . Now could we go ? Let 's get this day started .
SUSAN: I thought you were in a meeting ?
PARRISH: I am . With you .
SUSAN: There 's a start for a meeting .
PARRISH: I know it 's none of my business
SUSAN: No , it 's none of your business . Another moment .
PARRISH: Do you love Drew ?
SUSAN: You mean like you loved Mom ?
PARRISH: Forget about me and Mom are you going to marry him ?
SUSAN: Probably . A moment .
PARRISH: Do n't get carried away .
SUSAN: Uh oh
PARRISH: Susan , you 're a hell of a woman . You 've got a great career , you 're eautiful
SUSAN: And I 'm your daughter and no man will ever be good enough for me .
PARRISH: Well , I was n't going to say that
SUSAN: What were you going to say ?
PARRISH: Listen , I 'm crazy about the guy He 's smart , he 's aggressive , he could carry Parrish Communications into the 21st century and me along with it .
SUSAN: So what 's wrong with that ?
PARRISH: That 's for me . I 'm talking about you . It 's not so much what you say about Drew , it 's what you do n't say .
SUSAN: You 're not listening
PARRISH: Oh yes , I am . Not an ounce of excitement , not a whisper of a thrill , this relationship has all the passion of a pair of titmice .
SUSAN: Do n't get dirty , Dad
PARRISH: Well , it worries me . I want you to get swept away . I want you to levitate . I want you to sing with apture and dance like a dervish .
SUSAN: That 's all ?
PARRISH: Be deliriously happy . Or at least leave yourself open to be .
SUSAN: 'Be deliriously happy ' . I 'm going to do my upmost He smiles .
PARRISH: I know it 's a cornball thing but love is passion , obsession , someone you ca n't live without . If you do n't start with that , what are you going to end up with ? I say fall head over heels . Find someone you can love like crazy and who 'll love you the same way back . And how do you find him ? Forget your head and listen to your heart . I 'm not hearing any heart . Run the risk , if you get hurt , you 'll come back . Because , the truth is there is no sense living your life without this . To make the journey and not fall deeply in love well , you have n't lived a life at all . You have to try . Because if you have n't tried , you have n't lived .
SUSAN: Bravo .
PARRISH: Aw , you 're tough .
SUSAN: I 'm sorry . But give it to me again . The short version .
PARRISH: Stay open . Who knows ? Lightning could strike . Silence . PARRISH Forgive the lecture
SUSAN: I wo n't . And when I tell Drew about it , he wo n't either .
PARRISH: You wo n't tell him , and even if you did , he 'd clock it and punch it into his laptop in order to pull out some key phrases when he gives the Commencement Speech at Wharton .
SUSAN: You 're terrible .
PARRISH: I know . But I 'm the only fathe you 've got . She kisses him on the cheek .
SUSAN: Thank God .
PARRISH: He does n't care . But thanks anyway .
QUINCE: Hey , this is it , the hour approach- es , I 'm getting all excited . So what do you think , is it just the 'Executive Committee ' o could you guys use me ?
DREW: Quince , m'man , thanks for the offer , ut it 's all set for just me and Bill . More people might
QUINCE: I know . Gum up the works .
PARRISH: What ?
DREW: I was saying to Quince we wo n't need
PARRISH: Did you just hear something ?
DREW: Why yes , Bill , I was saying to Quince
PARRISH: No no , not you .
SUSAN: Daddy , what 's the matter ?
PARRISH: Nothing . I 'm sorry .
SUSAN: What is it , Daddy ?

DREW: It 's going to be great
PARRISH: Do you think I need a haircut ?
DREW: Bill , after this deal , you 'll be able to afford one . Parrish smiles , they step into the elevator .
PARRISH: Our first annual report , must be thirty-five years ago now , I owned two stations , I wrote down a state- ment of purpose , that one day you would wake up to a Parrish radio station , read a Parrish paper at eakfast , catch our news on tele- vision during the day , and go to bed with one of our books or magazines and you would always be told the truth and in the bargain , have a good time .
DREW: That 's great ! Wait 'til I show it to Bontecou .
BONTECOU: Bill , thanks for coming over And how 're you doing today , Drew ? You 've got a firecracker here , the kid 's really set the table .

PARRISH: I 'm sorry , I do n't recall
BONTECOU: Left field somewhere . Well , Bill , I want to come in from the outfield , at cleanup like you have , learn the plush ropes
PARRISH: I thought you were buying my company .
BONTECOU: Oh , Mr. Parrish , I could never buy Parrish Communications . I could pay for it , of course , but it would always have your imprint .
PARRISH: Well , that 's very nice to hear . Drew nods excitedly .
YOUNG MAN: Honey , you 've got to go on there 's a time to sow and a time to eap , you sow now and forget about him yeah , I liked him , I do n't like him anymore because you 're my honey and anybody messes with you messes with me I 'm on a plane in a minute as soon as I get my phone in , you 're my first call , that 's a promise where you going now ? good , hit the books , get that degree , one day we 'll hang out a shingle together you bet , honey later .

SUSAN: I 'm sorry
YOUNG MAN: Nothing to be sorry about . That 's the way with men and women , is n't it ?
SUSAN: What 's the way ?
YOUNG MAN: Nothing lasts .
SUSAN: I agree
YOUNG MAN: Why ?
SUSAN: I was just being agreeable , now I 've got to explain why ?
YOUNG MAN: I 'm not trying to sharpshoot you , ut that 'nothing lasts ' stuff , that 's what was the trouble with Honey 's guy . He was fooling around and Honey caught him at it . One girlfriend was n't enough for him .
SUSAN: So you 're a one-girl guy ?
YOUNG MAN: Damn right . Looking for her right now . Who knows ? You might be her . Susan laughs . YOUNG MAN Well , do n't laugh . I just arrived in town , got a new job I 'm trying to get into this apartment . You a doctor ?

YOUNG MAN: Everybody 's a doctor around here . This apartment house is all green pajamas and slippers . The guy I 'm waiting for to vacate is a doctor . What kind of doctor ?

LUISA: You 're right , Mr. Parrish . There was a gentleman at the door . He 's waiting for you in the foyer . Parrish is stunned .
PARRISH: Show him into the library , tell him I 'll be right there .

The man from whose lips fall 'rapture ' and 'passion ' and 'obses- sion'all those admonitions about eing 'deliberately happy ' , what there is no sense 'living your life without ' , all the sparks and energy you give off , the rosy advice you dispense in round , pear-shaped tones
PARRISH: What the hell is this ? Who are you ?
VOICE: Just think of millenniums multiplied y aeons compounded by infinity , I 've been around that long , but it 's only recently that your affairs here have piqued my interest . Call it oredom , the natural curiosity of me , the most lasting and significant element in existence has come to see you .
PARRISH: About what ?

PARRISH: Get what ?

PARRISH: Yes what ?
VOICE: 'Yes ' is the answer to your ques- tion .
PARRISH: What question ?
VOICE: Bill . Come on . The question . The question you 've been asking yourself with increased regularity , at odd moments , panting through the extra game of handball , when you ran fo the plane in Delhi , when you sat up in bed last night and hit the floo in the office this morning . The question that is in the back of you throat , choking the blood to you ain , ringing in the ears over and over as you put it to yourself
PARRISH: The 'question '
VOICE: Yes , Bill . The question . After a moment .
PARRISH: Am I going to die ?
YOUNG MAN: Yes .

YOUNG MAN: The jacket and the pair of pants came with the body I took . Let me ask your opinion . Do I blend in ?
PARRISH: You want me to be your guide ?
YOUNG MAN: You fill the bill , Bill .
PARRISH: I do ? How long will you be staying ?
YOUNG MAN: You should hope quite a while .
PARRISH: And then ? The Young Man nods , gently . PARRISH It 's it 's over .

JOE: We have an arrangement now .
DREW: What side of the industry did you say you were on ?
JOE: I did n't say .
DREW: Joe sounds like a ringer , Bill . I have the feeling you guys got the oad strokes already . Need any help with the details ?

SUSAN: That 's your name ?
ALLISON: And is n't it a lovely one ? So sturdy , so straight
DREW: Incidentally , Joe , where 're you staying ?

ALLISON: Now , I 'm getting interested . I want to know more -
PARRISH: We 've got some things to discuss . Parrish stands , motions for Joe to rise .
DREW: Did I hear 'business ' ?
SUSAN: What 'business ' ?
QUINCE: Do n't bother asking , we already tried .
JOE: It 's so very nice to see you again .
SUSAN: Funny , I do n't get that feeling . Maybe it 's because you found out I 'm Bill Parrish 's daughter .
PARRISH: Cut it out , Susan . You and I 've got to talk . Big day tomorrow , everybody . Joe , let 's go .
JOE: Susan . Allison . Quince . Drew . Bill Thank you .
PARRISH: Joe , that 's the kitchen .

JOE: 'Threw ' you ? Where ?
PARRISH: Shook me up . I mean that you knew her and everything
JOE: I did n't know her . The body I took knew her . The man she met in the coffee shop this morning . I - uh - took him .
PARRISH: So there 's nothing between you and Susan ?
JOE: No .
PARRISH: I wish you had said something to me about staying here
JOE: It had n't occurred to me until then . I was just having such a wonderful time Besides , is n't this what I 'm here for ?
PARRISH: No , I 'm okay with this - uh - I think . So He opens a door .
JOE: What a good idea .

JOE: No .
PARRISH: If there is anything else , do n't hesitate
JOE: I wo n't .
PARRISH: How long have I got ?
JOE: You 're putting me on the spot , Bill . A moment . JOE Let 's put it this way . When I go , you go .
PARRISH: When you go , I go .
JOE: That 's the best I can do . but minute-by-minute , I find myself lingering .
PARRISH: I just saw my doctor , he told me everything was fine .
JOE: Your doctor ? Did your doctor say anything about a tiny , undetectable hole in you aorta ? Did he mention an irreparab- ly weak vein in the further reaches of your famous brain ? Were they any prognostications about the possibil- ilites of a fatal collision on a golf cart of suffocating in an avalanche on a skin vacation in Gstaad ?
PARRISH: No
JOE: I hope you realize , Billin you office this morning , that was you time .
PARRISH: Closer than that .
JOE: Not at all .
PARRISH: And - uh - I guess , 'goodnight ' .
JOE: Good night to you , Bill . Parrish gently closes the door .
LUISA: Miss Allison asked if you would like to have your dinner kept warm ?
PARRISH: No . Thanks , Luisa .
LUISA: Very good , sir . Luisa turns
PARRISH: Luisa She stops . PARRISH Mr. Black 's luggage was misplaced by the airlines . Would you mind get- ting a few things together for him ? A couple of suits , some shirts , ties , underwear , shoes . Have Coyle take his measurements off what he is wearing tonight .
LUISA: Certainly , sir .
COYLE: Yes , sir ?
JOE: Hello . I 'm Joe Black . Nice to meet you .
COYLE: Yes sir , Mr. Black , a pleasure .
JOE: What are you eating .
COYLE: You mean this , sir ? Coyle regards his peanut butter sheepishly . COYLE Laura Scudder 's Peanut Butter .
JOE: 'Laura Scudder 's Peanut Butter ' . You like it ?
COYLE: I would say , sir , it is right up there with Jif and Skippy . But miles ahead of Peter Pan . Like a taste ?
JOE: Yes , I am . I thoroughly enjoyed this - uh - peanut butter . And I thoroughly enjoyed meeting you .
SUSAN: What are you doing here ?
JOE: I 'm lost .
SUSAN: Ca n't seem to escape you today .
JOE: I 'm sorry .
SUSAN: Hand me one of those , will you ?
JOE: 'Big ' ?
SUSAN: You appear at his side out-of-the- lue , stay at his house , eat dinne with his family , it 's practically a first . You 're in the red-hot cente of big business and I thought you were a regular Joe .
JOE: I am Joe .
SUSAN: Not the one I met this morning , hit- ting on me in as nice a way as I 've een hit on in a long time , but the moment you find out I 'm my Dad 's daughter , you act like a stranger .
JOE: That is not my intention . Joe continues to nibble at his peanut butter .
SUSAN: What are your intentions ? To make little dreams in coffee shops , turn a woman 's head , and I do n't mind admitting it was turned , I liked it , ut ten hours later I feel like a fool . I do n't get it . You , my father , here in this house , the cof- fee shop , it 's making me upset , and I do n't like being upset . Who are you anyway ? And what are you eating ?
JOE: Peanut butter . He finishes the spoonful . JOE But it 's gone now .
SUSAN: You act like you never had peanut utter before
JOE: I have n't .
SUSAN: What kind of childhood did you have ?
JOE: Do you love Drew ?
SUSAN: Come again ?
JOE: When you put your mouth to his , Susan , it seems a frequent thing .
SUSAN: Drew is none of your damn business . Nor is where I put my mouth .
JOE: I 'm sorry . Do you live here ?
SUSAN: No , Joe , I 'm swimming here . Then I 'm going home .
JOE: I guess what I 'm trying to say is I 'd like us to be friends .
SUSAN: I 've got plenty of friends .
JOE: I do n't have any .
SUSAN: I can see why .
JOE: I did n't mean to offend you at dinner . I 'm not quite at home some- times with people . I get busy doing - uh - what I do , and I do n't seem to have developed He drifts off .
SUSAN: Yes ?
JOE: I have a certain function to per- form , and that seems to take all of my time . Bu sometimes - uh - I speculate - uh - I have n't left oom for - uh - anything else .
SUSAN: I 'm sorry to say I know what you 're saying . A moment .
JOE: Susan ?
SUSAN: Yes ?
JOE: Did you know you have a wet spot on your shoulder ?
SUSAN: Goodnight , Joe .
JOE: Goodnight to you , Susan .
SUSAN: Shall we dance ?
JOE: Yes ?
SUSAN: I think you want to go to the west wing . Through there . Susan indicates yet another door .
JOE: Thank you .
PARRISH: Good morning .
JOE: Good morning , Bill .
PARRISH: How are you ? How 're you feeling ?
JOE: 'Feeling ' ? I feel fine . How do you feel ?
PARRISH: Um well , I did n't sleep too well . This is crazy . This is the left- field thing of all time . What do I do ? What do I tell my family ?
JOE: Oh , I would n't tell them anything , Bill . You 'll ruin the good start we had last night . I felt as if I were eing treated like a person . 'Joe ' this and 'Joe ' that - a nice smile - Quince passed me the rolls no 'rapture ' or 'passion ' or any of those mighty things you seem so intent on imparting , but I am cer- tain , should you - uh - say - uh - who I am - our adventure would end abruptly .
PARRISH: What about my family ? This 'adven- ture ' involved only me , right ?
JOE: And what ?
PARRISH: And I wo n't tell anyone who you are .
JOE: Sounds fair enough .
PARRISH: It is a deal ?
JOE: A 'deal ' ?
PARRISH: You give your word , I give mine that we 'll do what we say . It 's a truth exchanged between two people . A moment .
JOE: Bill
PARRISH: Yes ?
JOE: You 've got a deal .
PARRISH: Shake hands .
JOE: When you were shaving this morning , you were n't just shaving , right ?
PARRISH: What do you mean ?
JOE: You were hatching ideas , making plans , arriving at decisions , right ?
PARRISH: I guess so .
JOE: So you understand the concept then . When you 're busy here , your work , what your task is , is being executed elsewhere .
PARRISH: Of course .
JOE: So you 've grasped the idea . Con- gratulations . Now multiply it by infinity and take it to the depth of forever , and you still will have barely a glimpse of what I am talking about .
PARRISH: Joe ?
JOE: Yes , Bill .
PARRISH: How about giving a guy a break ?
JOE: Make an exception ?
PARRISH: There 's one to every rule .
JOE: Not this .
PARRISH: I do n't deserve this . I 'm still young , this is not my time
JOE: That 's what everybody says .
PARRISH: I 'm not everybody .
JOE: That 's what everybody says .
PARRISH: I want to live .
JOE: I understand . A moment . JOE But you ca n't .
PARRISH: What 's it like ?
JOE: What do you mean ?
PARRISH: What 's it like where I 'm going ?
JOE: Can you keep a secret ?
PARRISH: Yes .
JOE: So can I . They turn into Parrish 's office building .
JAIME: Good morning , Mr. Parrish .
PARRISH: Good morning , Jaime .
JAIME: Knight 's Reward in the 4th at Calder
PARRISH: I 'm sorry , not today , Jaime .
JENIFER: Did n't the family get together last night ?
PARRISH: Jennifer .
JENIFER: Of course , Mr. Parrish . Right away .
PARRISH: Perhaps you would like to wait in my office ?
JOE: No .
PARRISH: What I 'm trying to say is this is a Board meeting and you are not a mem- er of the Board .
JOE: I 'm sure you 'll see to it that it wo n't be a problem .
PARRISH: This is Joe Black , a personal associate of mine - uh - he 'll be joining us today . I know it 's uh unusual , and my apologies and Drew uh carry on .
DREW: Nice to see you . I did n't expect you , but certainly you ca n't get enough of a good thing .
JOE: Thank you .
DREW: The Board of Parrish Communications - is hereby called to order . Our sole order of business is an acceptance of John Bontecou 's generous offe and
JOE: Do you have any more of these deli- cious cookies ?
DREW: Anything else , Mr. Black ? How about some water ?
JOE: Why yes , thank you .
DREW: Hot or cold .
JOE: Cold .
DREW: And a glass .
PARRISH: Would you like to sit down , Joe ?
JOE: Yes . Joe sits .
DREW: To review we 're really crossing the 't 's and dotting the ' i 's here . Bill had a great and conclusive meeting with John Bontecou yester- day , all that remains for us is to put it to a vote .
PARRISH: Thank you , Drew .
DREW: Sounds like you 're not leaving much room for discussion .
PARRISH: Sorry . I know it looks like I 'm eversing my field .
DREW: That 's your privilege , Bill . But given our needs , given the absolute necessity for growth , given the fu- ture , the truth is joining John Bontecou is every bit as certain as - Death and Taxes . Joe interjects
JOE: 'Death and Taxes ' ? After a moment .
DREW: Yes .
JOE: `` Death and Taxes '' ? Another moment .
DREW: Yes .
JOE: What an odd pairing .
DREW: It 's just a saying , Mr. Black ,
JOE: Of whom ?
DREW: It does n't matter .
JOE: Then why did you bring it up ? Drew regards Joe .
DREW: You 're not familiar with the phrase , `` In this world , nothing is certain ut Death and Taxes '' ?
PARRISH: I am now .
DREW: Glad I could be of some help .
PARRISH: Shall we adjourn ?
DREW: But the matter 's still on the table , Bill
SLOANE: Why do n't we let it rest for the moment ? Give it some air ?
PARRISH: Well said , Eddie . Mr. Black , shall we ? Joe rises .
JOE: Those cookies were excellent .
DREW: Who is that guy ? Drew grabs a telephone DREW Felicia ?
PARRISH: What 's the deal here ? Are you going to be breathing down my neck ight 'til the very end ?
JOE: I do n't understand . Parrish tries to gather himself .
PARRISH: I 'd like to be alone for a while .
JOE: Are you sad , Bill ?
PARRISH: Yes , I am . There 's a research lib- ary on the fourth floor . Why do n't you go down and read some magazines ?
JOE: You 're not thinking of going some- where , are you , Bill ?
PARRISH: Joe , could I ask you to take a walk ? Buy a tie or something . I know I 'll e seeing you .
JOE: Of course . But Joe does n't move .
PARRISH: Now I 'd like to be alone .
JOE: Oh . Okay .
PARRISH: Here this will hold you for a while .
JOE: It ca n't buy happiness ? Parrish opens the door .
PARRISH: Jennifer , give Mr. Black a map of the city .
JOE: No thank you , Bill . I can manage . Joe goes .
SUSAN: Joe
JOE: How nice you look . Is that you uniform ? Susan regards him .
SUSAN: Why did you come here ? Joe does n't have an answer . SUSAN Are you ill ?
JOE: Oh goodness , no .
SUSAN: Then why are you here , Joe ?
JOE: I came to see you .
SUSAN: I do n't have any time to see you now . I 'm doing grand rounds and then I 'm examining back-to-back patients until dinner and then
JOE: Very well , I 'll watch .
SUSAN: Watch me do what ?
JOE: Whatever you do .
SUSAN: That 's impossible . I 'm a doctor , I 'm
JOE: And I 'll be a visitor .
SUSAN: Patients have visitors , not doctors .
JOE: I do n't mind
TEENA: Miss ? Miss Doctor ?
SUSAN: Just a minute , please .

JOE: Close your eyes , Easter .
SUSAN: Go with her . I 'll be right there . Teena goes . Joe remains his normal voice .
JOE: She 's in a great deal of pain .
SUSAN: Yes . Susan regards Joe , puzzled . SUSAN Have you spent a lot of time in the islands ?
JOE: Some . Joe shifts . JOE I - uh - I - realize now - uh - my eing here - um - your patient this is not really appropriate and I - uh
SUSAN: Do n't apologize . There 's nothing to be sorry for every hospital should have someone like you . Silence . SUSAN WellI 'm glad you came .
JOE: Thank you . I 'm so very glad to be here . Another awkward silence . JOE I guess you 're busy
SUSAN: Yes . She does n't move , they search for words .
JOE: Well , I could come again some othe time . Susan regards him .
SUSAN: Joe , I 'm with Drew .
JOE: Not now . Susan smiles gently . JOE Do n't you want me to come again ? A moment .
SUSAN: I have to go , I 'm sorry to say
JOE: Be sorry for nothing . Another moment .
SUSAN: Yes . Wellthank you , Joe . Susan turns to go , hesitates .
JOE: Good-bye , Susan .
PARRISH: It 's all yours .
JOE: Excellent . What is it ?
PARRISH: Cold lamb sandwich with cilantro . A little Coleman 's mustard . Joe takes another big bite .
JOE: Truly - uh - splendid .
PARRISH: Glad you like it . My wife turned me onto cold lamb sandwiches . Joan that was my wife
JOE: Uh-huh .
PARRISH: Cold lamb sandwiches not as chewy as roast beef , not as boring as chicken . She knew stuff like that .
JOE: And more .
PARRISH: Why did n't you stop me ?
JOE: WellI do n't know . Silence . JOE How was it the first time you met her ?
PARRISH: I thought you 'd heard a trillion times
JOE: This part I 'm interested in . A moment .
PARRISH: She had on this little blue suit with a little white collar that had little red piping on it
DREW: May I interrupting ?
JOE: Yes .
PARRISH: No .
DREW: 'Just kidding ' ?
PARRISH: Sit down , Drew .
DREW: Before I do I was hoping we might be alone , Bill .
PARRISH: Joe and I have no secrets from each other .
DREW: How nice for you both . Drew takes a moment , then plunges in . DREW Bill , pardon my candor , but I was confounded by your decision this morning .
PARRISH: Why ?
DREW: I was hired , you told me , to help ing Parrish Communications into the 21st Century . This merger is the vehicle Joe interrupts
JOE: Perhaps a merger is a way to bring Bill 's company into the 21st cen- tury . And perhaps it is n't . And perhaps cheating on your French Philosophers exam at The Groton School was an expedient way to get your diploma , and perhaps it was n't . Be that as it may , Drew , a question can often be argued both ways . Drew is stunned .
PARRISH: Joe , cut it out . And you too , Drew .
DREW: I thought this was practically a done deal
PARRISH: Well now it 's undone , okay ? Forget Bontecou ! Scrub him ! I 'm tired of his fancy name and his fancy offer . I 'm not going for it . A moment .
DREW: Okay . Drew heads for the door , turns around . DREW Can I invite myself to dinne tonight ? Susan and I had ticket for the Knicks game . But she said you guys were getting together
PARRISH: Dinner ? Absolutely .
JOE: Absolutely .
DREW: Damn decent of you . Drew exits .
JOE: Why , at this juncture , are you letting yourself be so concerned y business matters ?
PARRISH: I do n't want anybody buying up my life 's work and turning it into something it was n't meant to be . A man wants to leave something behind . And he wants it left behind the way he made it . And he wants it to be un the way he run it with a sense of honor , of dedication , of truth . Okay ?
JOE: Okay .
PARRISH: And I do n't need your goddamn permis- sion either ! You ! Drew ! I do n't need anyone to tell me how to run my life .
JOE: Easy , Bill . You 'll give yourself a heart attack and ruin my vacation .
ALLISON: We 're never all together two nights in a row . Maybe Christmas , Thanksgiving , that 's it . What 's going on ?
SUSAN: Nothing 's going on . Maybe he does n't want to be alone . He 's go- ing to be sixty-five in a minute
ALLISON: I do n't know , Daddy seems funny to me . Ever since Joe showed . It 's like he dropped from the clouds
DREW: Good question .
ALLISON: But he does seem very nice .
SUSAN: You think so ?
QUINCE: I read you all the way on the Bontecou thing , and I know where you 're coming from . And I 'm with you a hundred and one percent .
PARRISH: Thank you , Quince .
QUINCE: But I 've got to tell you , if mergers are in the wild , I 've got some great prospects I 've developed . I want to talk to you about them next week .
PARRISH: Next week ?
QUINCE: Yeah . Or the week after . Quince sees Parrish hesitate . QUINCE No good ?
PARRISH: No , anything is possible . It 's up to Joe .
QUINCE: Joe , you do n't know how glad I am you 're aboard . Anybody who can take some of the weight off the old man , I 'm in his corner .
JOE: That 's very gracious of you , Quince .
QUINCE: No problem . I 'll leave you two alone . I can tell you guys have something on the fire
ALLISON: Did you know twenty-six members of your rifle company are coming ?
PARRISH: Who ?
ALLISON: From the Korean War .
PARRISH: Conflict , honey . Korean Conflict .
ALLISON: Whatever it was , they 'll be here . We sent out invitations to everyone , plane tickets included the RSVP 's are amazing . A few of them we did n't hear from , and some of them are dead , of course
PARRISH: Of course .
ALLISON: You know , we 're going to give this party for you whether you like it o not .
PARRISH: I like it . I like it . I 'm sorry I do n't seem more appreciative .
ALLISON: That 's okay , Daddy .
QUINCE: I know you 're down , but you know when you 're down , Drew , there 's no place to go but up .
DREW: Thanks , Quince .
QUINCE: Never mind Bontecou . I 've got some other merger possibilities up my sleeve , and I 'm putting them to see old man .
DREW: Are you ?
QUINCE: We 'll do it together . I 'll clue you in . Timing 's got to be right . The old man says it 's up to Joe .
DREW: 'It 's up to Joe ' ? Those were his words ?
QUINCE: Yeah .
DREW: 'It 's up to Joe ' , huh ?
QUINCE: Yeah , that 's what he said .
DREW: Well , that 's very interesting .
QUINCE: I thought so , too . Joe 's a neat guy .
DREW: Yeah . Neat .
JOE: I wanted to apologize , Susan
SUSAN: I thought you said 'Be sorry fo nothing ' .
JOE: Well , now I am sorry . For intruding on you this afternoon .
SUSAN: It was n't an intrusion . And if it was , it turned out to be welcome .
JOE: I appreciate you
SUSAN: Excuse me ?
JOE: I mean I appreciate that .
SUSAN: And I appreciate you , too . A moment between them .
JOE: You do ? Well , thank you very much .
PARRISH: I was a little abrupt with you this afternoon , Drew . Forgive me . I want you to know I value your advice .
DREW: As much as Joe 's ? Parrish does n't answer . DREW Who is this man ? He 's giving ubiquitous a bad name . A moment .
PARRISH: You 're competitive soul , Drew . That 's what makes you a great addi- tion to the money . Joe is just around .
DREW: For how long ? And why ?
PARRISH: Please . Do n't worry about him . And above all , do n't antagonize him . Drew glances over at Joe .
DREW: Boss 's orders , huh ? I 'm great at following them . And I think I 'll start right now .
ALLISON: Dinner 's ready , everybody !
DREW: I have a confession to make to you , Joe . Joe just smiles in response . DREW Do you want to hear it ?
JOE: No .
DREW: Well , I 'm going to tell you anyway . I did cheat on that exam at Groton . But so did twenty-six other guys , and nobody ever mentioned it until today . And I 'm expecting you wo n't mention it again . I do n't know who you are and where you 're getting your information , but I 'm willing to pretend I did not hear it , and let ygones be bygones . But can I tell you something else , it 'd be nice to see the big guy without you next to him . What are you , his shadow ? Do you hold his dick for him when he goes to take a leak ? You know some- times somebody would like a few min- utes alone with W.P . That means without you . Okay , pal ? Let 's eat .
PARRISH: I - uh - want to thank you all for coming - uh - my family Everyone at the table is all attention . PARRISH Allison and Quince , Susan and the other members He glances at Joe , stops . PARRISH I 'm so happy when we can get together I mean I know you all have busy lives
SUSAN: Look who 's talking .
ALLISON: Yeah , speak for yourself .
PARRISH: Anyway I remember when you were little girls
QUINCE: I love little girls Allison elbows him .
PARRISH: And now you 're all grown up and I 'm - uh - um
SUSAN: It 'll come back , Daddy .
PARRISH: Will it ?
ALLISON: Daddy , you could sit down if you wanted to . A moment .
PARRISH: There is so much I would like to say but I ca n't So I better sit down . Carry on , everybody . He sits , then immediately stands up again . PARRISH One other thing why do n't we all have dinner again tomorrow night ?
ALLISON: Dinner ? Again ?
SUSAN: Have n't you had enough of us , Dad ?
PARRISH: No .
SUSAN: We 'll be here .
QUINCE: You bet .
ALLISON: With bells on .
JOE: I would prefer some peanut butter .
COYLE: How would you like that , sir ? On some kind of toast ?
JOE: Toast ? Nojust the butter .
COYLE: Right away . Coyle heads for the kitchen .
SUSAN: Why do you love peanut butter so much ?
JOE: I do n't know .
SUSAN: I adore things like that.food I ca n't do without . Do n't you ?
JOE: Yes
SUSAN: It comforts you , does n't it ?
JOE: YesI 've found that it does .
DREW: Mind if I throw up ?
PARRISH: Please , Drew .
JOE: I 'm very concerned about the woman you attended to today .
SUSAN: I am , too .
JOE: Has her pain abated ?
SUSAN: We 're doing what we can for her . But it does n't look good .
JOE: I 'm sorry to hear that .
DREW: Who are we talking about ?
JOE: But I know she 's grateful for the care you 're giving her .
DREW: Is this a state secret or are we eing excluded just for the fun of it ?
JOE: Susan 's patient is whom we are talking about .
SUSAN: Joe visited the hospital today . Parrish 's head swivels to Joe .
ALLISON: Did he ? That 's more than we get to do .
DREW: Well , maybe next time Joe goes , he 'll take us along .
JOE: Perhaps you could remind me .
DREW: I 'll make a note of it . Anything else ?
QUINCE: I 'd like to come , too . See Susan strut her stuff .
DREW: You 're on , Quin-cee . Destination Hospital . Joe , you 'll be the Tou Guide . Okay ? How 's that sound to you ?
JOE: Susan is a wonderful doctor .
DREW: I have to go , Bill it 's been a helluva day . Need a few minutes to sort everything out .
PARRISH: Okay , we 'll see you tomorrow .
DREW: Sure .
PARRISH: Why did you go to the hospital ?
JOE: I do n't know .
PARRISH: You were just curious ?
JOE: I guess
PARRISH: About Susan ?
JOE: I would n't put it that way .
PARRISH: What way would you put it ?
JOE: You tell me , Bill .
PARRISH: How about you telling me ? When I ask a simple question , I expect a straight answer . That 's what I 'm used to . Anybody who does n't give it to me , I fire .
JOE: Are you going to fire me , Bill ? Silence , Parrish is at a loss .
SUSAN: See you tomorrow night .
DREW: Include me out . I 've had enough of the conversations .
SUSAN: You do n't mean that . You would n't disappoint Daddy
DREW: Daddy 'll do fine . Besides , he 's got Joe . And so do you .
SUSAN: Drew , you 're out of line .
DREW: That may be . But I do n't like the fucker . I do n't like the way he looks at you and talks to you . And vice versa .
SUSAN: Sorry , but I like the way he looks and talks to me . And vice versa . Okay ?
DREW: No , not okay . I thought we had a good thing going here . It shows you never know . Silence , neither knows how to continue .
SUSAN: Well goodnight .
DREW: Yeah . Goodnight .
SUSAN: How long have you been standing there ?
JOE: I do n't like the way Drew spoken to you . But I feel better about it now ecause of the way you spoke back . A moment .
SUSAN: Tell me about yourself , Joe . Who you are . What you 're doing with my father .
JOE: Why ?
SUSAN: Because guys who never say anything about themselves are always married . Joe does n't respond . SUSAN So you are married .
JOE: No , I 'm not .
SUSAN: Girlfriend ?
JOE: No .
SUSAN: Gay ?
JOE: No . Susan comes closer to Joe .
SUSAN: Then tell me , Joe , how come a man as attractive , intelligent , well- spoken , diffident in the most sed- uctive way , and yet powerful , is all alone in this world ?
JOE: Thank you , I appreciate that .
SUSAN: Where are you going ?
JOE: To bed .
SUSAN: 'To bed ' ?
JOE: Yes . I 'm tired .
PARRISH: That was wonderful .
SUSAN: Yeah , it 's good to get together .
PARRISH: Do you mind if I raise a little caution flag ?
SUSAN: Raise away .
PARRISH: What is the nature of your interest in Joe ?
SUSAN: Well , remember how you told me about `` lightning striking '' ? The nature of it 's in there somewhere .
PARRISH: I wo n't say you may be getting onto shaken ground
SUSAN: Then what will you say ?
PARRISH: I do n't think this is the lightning you are looking for . Drew 's a good man . I know I did n't seem to be completely in his corner before , but I 've come to appreciate
SUSAN: Now we love Drew and Joe in verbo- ten ? What 's going on ?
PARRISH: Nothing .
SUSAN: When you say 'nothing ' that way , it 's not nothing .
PARRISH: Then what is it ?
SUSAN: It 's something . She kisses him . SUSAN G'night , Daddy . See you tomorrow . This is getting interesting . She goes .
DREW: I know you 're all as uncomfor- table as I am to be meeting without Bill , but I got a call last night from John Bontecou . Not only is he still interested , he is sweetening his offer . Although it pains me to say it , in my opinion Bill Parrish dealt with us peremptorily in dismissing any deal with Bontecou . Therefore , I 'm sorry to say that if we are to exam- ine this new offer responsibly as the Board of Directors of Parrish Communications , we must do so with- out its Chairman . Oh yes , there is one additional element Bontecou is so anxious to get us , he said he 'd take Parrish Communications with our Chairman o without .
SLOANE: And what would that be ?
DREW: Bill 's birthday is the day afte tomorrow . There is a provisory by- law in our charter . Per the discre- tion of the Board , Corporate off- icers can be retired at age sixty- five .
SLOANE: You 're taking this too far , Drew .
DREW: Am I not obligated to ?
SLOANE: You 're building this thing up too much , Drew . He 's had advisors be- fore . Nobody tells Bill what to do .
DREW: Thank you for coming .
SLOANE: Hello , Quince .
QUINCE: Hi , Ed , hi folks , I did n't know everybody was going to be here , what a nice surprise . What 's the big confab ?
SLOANE: This is a secret meeting .
DREW: I hope you 'll respect its nature What we 're trying to do here is gather our thoughts in light of Bill 's rejection of Bontecou 's offe and make an appropriate presenta- tion to him as to how we think the company might proceed . Wo n't you share with our Board the information you gave me last night ?
QUINCE: Well , I 'm happy to tell you I 've got good news . As I was telling Drew , I 've been making a little hay while the Bontecou sun was shining two , possibly three new and boiling hot prospects for merger .
DREW: How did Bill react to the leads you 've developed ?
QUINCE: He was interested .
DREW: But he was concerned about the timing ?
QUINCE: The timing yes . He says it 's up to Joe .
DREW: 'It 's up to Joe ' ?
QUINCE: That 's what he said .
PARRISH: What is this ?
ALLISON: Annie made them .
PARRISH: Who 's Annie ?
ALLISON: From La Rosette , only the greatest pastry chef in America . This is orange , from real Seville oranges . Lemon , on a mille-feuille crust , a little on the fanciful . And a while , nothing like a good old white cake , vanilla , with Angel food ut some maroons shavings thrown in .
PARRISH: I do n't like cake .
ALLISON: It 's for the party , Dad
PARRISH: Oh , the goddam party
ALLISON: 'Goddam party ' ! Allison bursts into tears . ALLISON Did you hear that ?
QUINCE: This is great , honey . The orange . Has it got a little vodka in it ? Like that Finnish stuff , orange vodka Put your lips around this one , Bill . It 's out of this world .
PARRISH: No thank you , Quince . I 'm sorry , honey . I 'm no good at this . Why do n't you choose whateve cake you like ?
ALLISON: I knew you were going to say that . Tito Puente . The old platoon . Now the cake . You just do n't care . Why did I do this ? I should have my head examined . I 'm trying to throw the party for the century for my father - and you know what he does n't give a shit . She bursts into tears all over again .
QUINCE: But he does give a shit . Do n't you , Bill ?
PARRISH: Yeah , I give a shit .
QUINCE: See . There . What 'd I tell you ?
ALLISON: Yeah , but
QUINCE: But what ?
ALLISON: What will I tell Annie ? Parrish forks a bit of a cake .
PARRISH: This one .
QUINCE: The vodka . What 'd I tell you ?
JOE: Cirrhosis of the liver is the fifth leading killer of adult Western males .
QUINCE: I did n't know that .
JOE: On the other hand , Winston Churchill drank a bottle of cognac a day and lived until he was ninety-one . After a moment .
QUINCE: You 're an original , Joe . A little hard to figure , maybe
JOE: And you 're a nice man , Quince .
QUINCE: Thanks .
JOE: You 're welcome .
DREW: Sorry to intrude , Bill , but we 've got a bit of a crisis downtown it 's not something we could talk about on the phone . Parrish takes Drew aside . DREW The Board 's real unhappy , Pappy they felt you dealt with them pre- emptorily , you never gave them a chance to speak
PARRISH: What is there to say ? They know what John Bontecou is and if they did n't , they know now .
DREW: Yes , you made your feeling abun- dantly clear . Now they want to do the same with theirs .
PARRISH: What are their feelings ?
DREW: If I read this Board right now , they want you to accept Bontecou 's offer .
PARRISH: Over my dead body .
DREW: What do you think the Board is going to say when I tell them that ?
PARRISH: I do n't care .
DREW: With all due respect , you damn well etter care because if you try to stonewall them again , there 'll be lood on the floor .
PARRISH: Whose ?
DREW: Yours .
PARRISH: I 'm feeling real uncomfortable right now because the guy who reports to me is threatening me .
DREW: I 'm just giving you the truth . There was a time when William Parrish liked the truth .
PARRISH: I think it 's time you went home , Drew .
DREW: Certainly . Goodnight .
SUSAN: Drew ! He stops . SUSAN Never talk to my father like that again .
DREW: Do n't worry about it . There 's a eginning and a middle and an end to everything . And I think I 've come to the end of my chapter with the Parrishes . Joe has followed them into the hallway . DREW And the end began with this guy . Drew looks down towards Joe . DREW Mr. Black ? We ran a check on you and you know what we came up with ?
JOE: No , I do n't
DREW: Not good , not bad , you know what we got ? Nothing . No credit , no cars , no mortgages no wives . Nothing . Joe waits . DREW All of a sudden a guy appears on the scene with the Chairman of one of the greatest communications corpora- tions of the world , the boss makes him privy to all the company 's secrets , he attends the Board meet- ings , and us working stiffs with MBA 's up the ass and years and years and years of experience , we 're left outside with our noses pressed against the window . Joe does n't respond . DREW This is a big-time operation , deal- ing in big-time issues , demanding ig-time executives who make big- time decisions . So , Joe , why do n't you tell me exactly what it is that 's big time about you ? After a moment .
JOE: You first .
SUSAN: Why do n't you get off his case ?
DREW: Oh , you 're the great Joe 's attorney now ? Are we going to go to court ? Or are we going to go to bed ? And I do n't mean you and me . I mean you and him .
SUSAN: That 's it . It 's over . Get out .
DREW: So I guess a blowjob 's out of the question ? Joe clears his throat . DREW Did you say something ? Joe considers him evenly .
JOE: Almost .
SUSAN: I said get out .
JOE: What an angry fellow .
SUSAN: I 'm sorry about
JOE: Please . We do n't need to talk about Drew . She regards Joe .
SUSAN: No . We do n't .
JOE: I love your smell .
SUSAN: I guess you have n't .
JOE: Thank you .
SUSAN: It was everything . Silence , the TICKING of the clock . SUSAN When I was little , my mother used to say , `` Darling , you could set you heart by this clock '' .
JOE: Could you ?
SUSAN: Never tried , 'til now . Joe , may I kiss you ?
JOE: Why , yes . Thank you . A moment .
SUSAN: You 're welcome .
JOE: You 're welcome .
SUSAN: Joe ?
JOE: Yes ?
SUSAN: I do n't know who you are .
JOE: WellI 'm uh , Joe . And you 're Susan . And I - uh - have this weak feeling in my knees
SUSAN: And is your heart beating strangely ?
JOE: Faster . And I want the scent from underneath your ears and the taste of your lips and the touch of you tongue to stay with me forever . An intake of breath . She is about to speak . JOE And you do n't even have to say a word . Their faces inches from each other 's .
SUSAN: I have to go home . But neither Susan nor Joe moves . SUSAN Do n't I ?
JOE: Hello , Bill .
PARRISH: Hello . Would you like to join me , Quince and Allison for a nightcap ?
JOE: Um not right now . An awkward moment .
PARRISH: Okay . Goodnight .
JOE: Goodnight .
JENIFER: Good morning , Mr. Parrish .
PARRISH: Good morning , Jennifer .
JENIFER: The Board is waiting .
PARRISH: What ?
JENIFER: Did n't you call a Board meeting ?
PARRISH: Good morning .
DREW: Did you want to have a cup of coffee or something , Bill ?
PARRISH: I do n't think so . Do you ?
DREW: To get to the point , we have re- ceived new information from John Bontecou concerning his desires fo this company to merge with his , and we wanted to set the details before you .
PARRISH: That 's it ?
DREW: Bontecou wants a quick response and
PARRISH: The answer is no , quick enough fo you ?
DREW: Do n't you want to hear the details ?
PARRISH: I 'm not interested in the details . And I 'm not interested in the big picture either . What I am inter- ersted in is how my Board got conven- ed behind my back , is entertaining a further proposal from a man whom it offends me to do business with , moreover has the audacity to present this to me like a prize fish , and I am expected to clap for it like a performing seal . No , thank you .
DREW: So I am to understand from your re- sponse that you do not want to hea the details of Bontecou 's offer ?
PARRISH: Yes , you are to understand that , and now may I ask you a question ?
DREW: Certainly , Bill .
PARRISH: Are you running this Board or am I ? Sloane leans in .
SLOANE: We 're not getting anywhere here . Why do n't we take some of the best out of this thing , let 's conside it coolly , let 's take a week
DREW: Bontecou wants a speedier response than that .
SLOANE: He 'll wait
PARRISH: Does n't need to . Today , tomorrow , a week from now ' a week from now ' , who can think about a week from now the answer is going to e the same a loud , unmistakable , all-inclusive , airtight 'No ' .
DREW: Before we do , while we 're here , there is a second question the Board would like a response to , a far simpler one . Parrish waits . DREW Who is the man sitting to the right of you ? Everybody 's eyes are on Joe .
PARRISH: I 've already introduced Mr. Black to you all .
DREW: But who is he ? What are his creden- tials ? What is his relationship to you ? No response from Parrish . DREW The feeling of the Board is this we fear Mr. Black is not only influenc- ing your decisions in regard to this company , but that you are relying on him to make them for you .
PARRISH: In English , please .
DREW: Mandatory retirement upon ou Chairman 's sixty-fifth birthday . Parrish is expressionless . DREW At which time , the Chairman will be named Emeritus , he will be welcome to attend all meetings , and will serve as International Spokesman fo the corporation plus , of course , a settlement , a golden parachute of such magnitude that his feet will never touch the ground . Drew pauses . DREW Please indicate your vote by a `` Yes '' or `` No '' .
PARRISH: Thank you for allowing me to save face , Drew . Joe 's eyes are riveted on Drew .
DREW: The other motion before us is the acceptance of John Bontecou 's offe to merge this corporation with Bontecou International Parrish stands , Drew stops speaking .
PARRISH: Joe ? Silence , then Joe rises .
JOE: Who I am , and my relationship to Bill , will be divulged in our own good time . Joe follows Parrish out of the room .
SLOANE: It 's not over , 'til it 's over .
PARRISH: Please , Eddie , no 'Fat Lady Sings '' shit .
SLOANE: I still sense some doubt in this group , we could turn it around . You 'll be up in the country ?
PARRISH: Yes , the big 'celebration ' of my mandatory retirement birthday . You 're an honored guest , Eddie .
SLOANE: I 'm going to stick it out here . We still have a shot .
QUINCE: What have you done ? You 've gotten the old man fired !
DREW: That we did . Thanks to you . He was wobbling , mind you , but you stupid the coup de grace .
QUINCE: I 'm going to put a stop to this !
DREW: Quince , you ca n't unscramble scrambled eggs .
QUINCE: But I did n't mean to do it !
DREW: The train 's left the station , pal , and you 're aboard . Would you like to hear the silver lining ? Check that , gold . I 've been working with John Bontecou all along . We had a game plan acquire Parrish Communications then break it apart and peddle it piece-by-piece to the highest bidder . I set it up fo him , he smacks it out of the park . Quince is struck dumb . DREW Do n't you know what this 'll mean ? You 'll be rich . You 'll sell you stock , you can stop kissing ass What 'll it feel like to be a man ?
QUINCE: I do n't want to get rich this way I 'm going to expose you .
DREW: Go right ahead . Tell William Parrish how you betrayed him at a secret Board meeting . And tell Allison how you got her fathe fired and he lost his company . Quince goes ashen . DREW It 's just life , Quin-cee . Drew hails an employee across the hall . DREW Wake up and smell the thorns .
JOE: I 'm sorry , Bill
PARRISH: That 's okay .
JOE: What 's okay ?
PARRISH: Just a manner of speaking . Joe seems puzzled .
JOE: 'Fish ' ?
PARRISH: Never mind . I 'm tired . I 'm going to take a nap . A moment . PARRISH Are you hungry ? Coyle will have Luisa fix you something to eat .
JOE: I 'm not hungry .
PARRISH: Then I ca n't help you .
SUSAN: You 're here ?
JOE: I am .
SUSAN: I just thought I 'd drop by , scrounge a little lunch , I was in the neigh- orhood
JOE: How beautiful . He starts to hang Susan 's coat up .
SUSAN: Just throw it on the chair .
JOE: He 's taking a nap .
SUSAN: He must be tired this Bontecou thing
JOE: Yes , he 's tired . I believe so . A moment . JOE You must be hungry ? Susan sits on the couch .
SUSAN: No , not anymore . Are you ?
JOE: No .
SUSAN: Maybe it 's the draft through the door .
JOE: Thank you .
SUSAN: Did you like making love to me ?
JOE: I loved it .
SUSAN: More than you love peanut butter ?
JOE: Yes !
SUSAN: Where are you going ?
JOE: Nowhere ? I'mhere .
SUSAN: For how long ?
JOE: Oh , I hope a long , long time . A moment .
SUSAN: Me , too . Another moment .
JOE: What do we do now ? She smiles .
SUSAN: It will come to us .
JOE: Hello , Bill .
PARRISH: I could n't sleep .
JOE: I 'm sorry to hear that . He starts up the stairs .
PARRISH: No , I 'll come down
JOE: Yes , I saw you see me .
PARRISH: Well , you 're at the wrong place at the wrong time with the wrong woman .
JOE: I 'll be the judge of that .
PARRISH: I 'm her father !
JOE: With all due respect , Bill , I 'm not asking your permission .
PARRISH: Well , you goddam well should . You walk into my life , give me the worst news a guy can get , have me dancing on the heads of pins with my busi- ness and with my family , and now you 're spooning with my daughter .
JOE: 'Spooning ' ?
PARRISH: Yes , and stop repeating everything I sai , and turning it into a question . Spooning , fooling around , God knows what . You arrive on the scene why you picked me , I still do n't under- stand
JOE: I picked you for your verve , you excellence , and for your ability to - how shall I say - instruct . You 've lived a first-rate life . And I find it eminently usable . Parrish measures Joe .
PARRISH: What do you want ? Joe does n't answer , riveted now on Parrish . PARRISH Everybody wants something , Joe . You 've been taking me from pilla to post here . I thought I knew who you were , and it was n't a whole lot of fun , however it was almost bear- able . Now I 'm getting something else from you , something very , very strange what is it that you want , Joe ?
JOE: I 'm only following the Parrish ywords . Looking for that 'ounce of excitement ' , that 'whisper of a thrill ' What there is no sense living your life without . You know what I mean , Bill . Parrish 's jaw sets .
PARRISH: You 're violating the laws of the universe .
JOE: This universe ?
PARRISH: Any universe that exists or eve existed . You may be the pro , Joe . But I know who you are . And you 're all fucked up .
JOE: I do n't like your tone , and I do n't like your references .
PARRISH: And I do n't give a shit .
JOE: May I remind you this is not just a dispute with a putative suitor , this is me . So watch itBill .
PARRISH: Cut the 'Bill ' crap out you sonofabitch .
JOE: I told you , 'watch it ' .
RECEPTIONIST: Can I help you ?
JOE: Dr. Parrish .
RECEPTIONIST: She comes on at 6 .
JOE: Oh .

PARRISH: Hello , honey .
SUSAN: Where 's Joe ?
PARRISH: Joe ? A silence . PARRISH Joe 's not around .
SUSAN: Where is he ?
PARRISH: I do n't know . Susan seems distracted . PARRISH Why are you looking for Joe ?
SUSAN: Because I was sitting in a staff meeting , incredibly bored , my mind kept wandering and the only place it landed was Joe .
PARRISH: I do n't understand .
SUSAN: Love . Passion . Obsession , all those things you told me to wait for . Well , they 've arrived . Parrish blinks , stares down at his cards .
PARRISH: This is crazy
SUSAN: Why ? A man appears at your side , almost never leaves it , you clearly trust him , depend on him , I sense you value him deeply , why are n't those things good enough for me ?
PARRISH: You do n't know anything about Joe
SUSAN: What are you afraid of , Dad ? That I 'll fall head over heels for Joe well , I have as you did with Mom . That 's always been standard , whether you like or not .
PARRISH: Susan , I do n't think Joe is going to e with us long .
SUSAN: Where 's he going ?
PARRISH: I do n't know , I ca n't say
SUSAN: C'mon ! The guy 's working with you . You always know chapter and verse about everyone who works
PARRISH: In this case , I ca n't . I - uh I just ca n't help you . I only would tell you that with Joe , you are on very , very dangerous ground . Susan does n't answer for a moment .
SUSAN: I love him .
PARRISH: I do n't care if you love him ! I 'm telling you he 's no good for you ! A moment .
SUSAN: Of course not , Daddy . I 'm sorry .
CLERK: Change ! Change !
JOE: Why are you giving me money ?
CLERK: Change .
JOE: I am who I am . I can not change .
CLERK: You change !
JOE: That 's impossible . You 're wasting your money . I could n't change even if I wanted to .
PARRISH: Yes ?
JOE: I have the feeling that , all in all , what I made this voyage for has served its purpose .
PARRISH: What are you saying , that it 's time to go ?
JOE: You are ?
PARRISH: Yeah .
JOE: Good . Tomorrow , after the party . Parrish nods , Joe nods back .
MAY: Telephone call , sir . Mr. Sloane from New York .
PARRISH: Excuse me .
ALLISON: Hi , Daddy , what do you think ?
PARRISH: It 's starting to grow on me . But what do the ' B ' and ' P ' mean ?
ALLISON: The fountain is the Caspian Sea and the Sea is serving up caviar . The ' B 's for Beluga , the ' P ' fo Petrossian . Of course , they also stand for 'Bill ' and for 'Parrish ' .
PARRISH: Do they , m'dear ?
ALLISON: Plus we 've got a baritone with a alalaika coming from The Russian Tea Room . I 've dressed him in a Cossack shirt and he 'll sing Nelson Eddy songs . Parrish shakes his head .
PARRISH: You are amazing . Why , oh why , Allison , are you doing all this ?
ALLISON: I do it because I love you . Because everybody I loved you . Mommy wher- ever she is Susan , Quince , the people who work for you , everybody who 's ever known you .
PARRISH: Yeah ? And what about my enemies ?
ALLISON: They respect you . Is n't that a kind of love ?
PARRISH: I have n't been the father to you that
ALLISON: That you 've been to Susan ?
PARRISH: I was n't going to say
ALLISON: But that 's what you were thinking . And that 's okay . Because I know you love me . Not like it is with Susan , the way your eyes light up when she comes in the room and the way she always gets a laugh out of you , as opposed to me when I walk in a room and that look comes over your face , `` What does she want now ? ''
PARRISH: Hey , there 's lots to come . A little excess like you love .
ALLISON: Yes , it is .
QUINCE: Give me a Seagrams and ' 7 ' . Ambrose looks at him blankly . QUICNCE No got ? Okay a double V.O. , wate ack .
AMBROSE: I 'm afraid this is a wine bar , Mr. Quince .
QUINCE: Okay , give me a bottle of wine .
AMBROSE: Red or white ?
QUINCE: Both .
JOE: No , thank you .
QUINCE: C'mon , have a drink . You look like you need one bad as me .
JOE: Do I ? I 'm a little confused .
QUINCE: Confused , huh ? About what ?
JOE: Love .
QUINCE: 'Love ' ? Oh , man , I 've got troubles of my own .
JOE: You love Allison , do n't you ?
QUINCE: Oh yes , I do .
JOE: How did you meet ?
QUINCE: I was a world-class loser and she was a happy , little rich girl and for some reason she took me in .
JOE: But she loves you ? Quince smiles , nods embarrassedly . JOE How do you know ?
QUINCE: Because there 's nothing we do n't know about each other and it 's okay . I mean the deeper , darkest secrets they do n't matter .
JOE: 'The deepest , darkest secrets ' ?
QUINCE: Yeah , it 's like you know every inch of each other 's souls and then you 're free .
JOE: What do you mean 'free ' ?
QUINCE: Free to love each other . Com- pletely . Totally . No fear .
JOE: Oh yes , you are one of my favorites .
QUINCE: What would you say if you knew it was me who brought down Bill Parrish ? I told Drew and the Board that Bill depended on you . Drew led me on , ut I had no business telling him in the first place . He was setting up Bill from day one . Drew and Bontecou are going to chop up the company and sell it off for parts . Bontecou was outside , Drew was Mr . Inside . And I was the fool who made it all happen . Oh God , what do I do ? Joe regards Quince .
JOE: Go to Bill Parrish and tell him everything . He 'll forgive you . Quince drains one more glass of wine .
QUINCE: You think so ? How do you know ?
JOE: Because that 's the kind of man Bill Parrish is . A moment .
QUINCE: Well , maybe I guess you know him etter than anybody . Another moment .
JOE: Getting to .
QUINCE: Do you think I should wait to tell him 'till after the party ?
JOE: No .
SUSAN: I like you in a black tie .
JOE: I love you in an evening gown .
SUSAN: It beats a surgical , does n't it ? He smiles . SUSAN Daddy told me you might be leaving ?
JOE: Yes . Your father and I , our time together has come to an end .
SUSAN: Where are you going ?
JOE: Well I
SUSAN: And you ca n't tell me who you are .
JOE: I can tell you the when part . Tonight .
SUSAN: It gets worse .
JOE: No worse than it gets for me . I 'm in love with a woman whom I do n't want to leave .
SUSAN: Then do n't . A moment .
JOE: We know so little about each other
SUSAN: We know all that we need to know
JOE: But there 's so much to tell you
SUSAN: Do n't . That will come later .
JOE: Will it ?
SUSAN: Lightning struck . We caught it in a bottle . Do n't let it out . I want to be with you , Joe Another moment .
JOE: What will we do ?
SUSAN: 'Love will find out the way ' .
JOE: 'Love will find out the way ' ?
SUSAN: It 's a saying .
JOE: I believe that , do n't you ?
SUSAN: Yes , that 's why I said it .
QUINCE: what can I say after I say that I 'm sorry ? I zipped when I should 've zagged , I opened my big mouth one too many times , everything got all twisted
PARRISH: It 's okay , Quince . I understand . You 've always meant well and I appreciate that . Sometimes things just turn out wrong . A KNOCK on the door , it opens , Joe appears .
JOE: Excuse me He starts to step out .
QUINCE: Come in , Joe I want to thank you okay , Bill ?
PARRISH: Sure .
QUINCE: Joe knew the whole story . I told him . It was his idea that I come clean . I mean I wanted to come clean but he gave me a pair of alls , you know what I mean ?
PARRISH: Yes , I believe I do . Quince now drifts off .
QUICHE: Yeah , well I can tell you guys got business
PARRISH: No , I 'm out of business , right , Quince ? However I do have some unfinished business with Drew . Get him out here . Get him on the chopper and get him out here to- night . I want to tell this guy how I feel about him face-to-face .
QUINCE: Oh , that could be a tall order , B.P . I doubt that Drew 's anxious to see you face-to-face . Joe steps in .
JOE: Tell Drew that Bill acknowledges that this was a contest and he 's lost . The race is to the swift , ut could Drew summon a modicum of understanding and allow Bill to save face . Tell him Bill wants it understood in the business community he has merely moved upstairs in his own company , and the executive continuity is unbroken . Tonight 's the night to do it . He 'll introduce Drew to his press friends as well as some of his close acquaintances from Washington and Drew can tell them that everything 's sailing along just fine .
PARRISH: All in all , what Bill wants to do is uild the golden bridge to Drew with no hard feelings .
QUINCE: You think Drew will go for it ?
PARRISH: Quince , I 've got confidence in you .
QUINCE: Sir , I 'll deliver the package . He heads out , Parrish and Joe fall silent .
PARRISH: Thanks .
JOE: Not at all . A moment . JOE How are you doing ?
PARRISH: What the hell do you care ?
JOE: I was just asking , Bill .
PARRISH: You 'want to know ' , I 'll tell you . You 're looking at a man who tonight is not about to walk through the Valley of the Shadow of Death , he 's galloping into it . And the same time , the business he built with his own hands and his own head is being commandeered by a couple of cheap pirates . And , oh yes , I almost forgot , my daughter 's fallen in love with Death . Another moment .
JOE: And I 'm in love with you daughter .
PARRISH: Say again ?
JOE: I 'm in love with your daughter , and I 'm taking her with me tonight . Parrish is stunned .
PARRISH: You 're what ?
JOE: I think you heard me , Bill .
PARRISH: You 're not taking Susan anywhere . And what the hell does that mean anyway ? Joe does n't answer for a moment . PARRISH I thought we had a deal .
JOE: I 'm sorry , Bill
PARRISH: Susan is my daughter , she has a wonderful life ahead of her and you 're going to deprive her of it and you 're telling me you 're sorry ? Well , I 'm sorry , apology not accepted .
JOE: I love her , Bill . She is all that I ever wanted , and I 've never wanted for anything because I 've neve wanted anything before , if you can understand .
PARRISH: How perfect for you to take whatever you want because it pleases you . It 's not love
JOE: Then what is it ?
PARRISH: Some aimless infatuation in which , for the moment , you feel like in- dulging . It 's missing everything that matters .
JOE: Which is what ?
PARRISH: Trust , responsibility , taking the weight , for your choices and feel- ings and spending the rest of you life living up to them . And above all , not hurting the object of you love .
JOE: So that 's what love is ?
PARRISH: Multiply it by infinity and take it to the death of forever and you will still have barely a glimpse of what I am talking about .
JOE: Those were my words , Bill .
PARRISH: Well , they 're mine now . Joe is silent for a moment , cogitating .
JOE: Susan wants to come . She says she 's in love with me .
PARRISH: With you ? ! Who is 'you ' ? Did you tell her who you are ?
JOE: No .
PARRISH: Does she know where she 's going ? Joe does n't answer . PARRISH Susan went , in whatever way she did , for that poor sonofabitch whose body you took , and everything else since has been aftermath . You say you love her but you do n't know what love is . She 'loves ' you but she does n't know who you are . You make a deal , you 're eaking it the bottom line is , Joe , you 're conducting a Great Romance under false pretenses .
JOE: I do n't like what you 're saying .
PARRISH: I do n't expect you to .
JOE: Are you threatening me ?
PARRISH: I certainly hope so I loved Susan from the moment she was born , and I love her now , and every minute in etween , and what I dream of is a man who will discover her and she will discover a man who will love her , who is worthy of her , who is of this world , of this time and has the grace and compassion and fortitude to walk beside her as she makes he way through this beautiful thing called life . Parrish is beginning to reach Joe .
JOE: Are you telling me I ca n't be part of it ? A pause , Parrish 's posture changes .
PARRISH: Why did you come in here and tell me , Joe ? You are the Biggest Shot of all , you do n't have to ask my permission , but that 's what you 're doing . You know why ? Because you 've somewhere , somehow , developed into a good guy , and you know this is all wrong I do n't know what you 're going to do how can this be love ? She does n't know who you are . Why do n't you tell her ? Try it out on her ? See what happens . Reveal everything there is to know about yourself and let the chips fall where they may . Joe has received what Parrish has said . PARRISH Okay ? I 've given it my best shot . I wish I could tell you to sleep on it but
SUSAN: Hello , Joe . What 'd you know ? She smiles . SUSAN There 's something so indescribably sexy about you in a crowd . I could make love to you right here .
JOE: There is something I do want to tell you He stammers into silence .
SUSAN: But you ca n't . Joe is about to respond but does n't . SUSAN Just then when you hesitated the way you shift from foot-to-foot , I 've always found endearing but just now I got a chill . But he drifts again , now she takes his hand . SUSAN Remember that morning in the coffee shop ? You said 'What 's wrong with taking care of a woman , she takes care of you ``
JOE: Did I say that ?
SUSAN: And I said you 'd have a hard time finding a woman like that . Joe shifts , she smiles at his embarrasement . SUSAN Well , you 've found one , Joe .
JOE: The 'coffee shop '
SUSAN: That was the place and you were the guy .
JOE: I - uh
SUSAN: You want me to wait for you , you 'll e back
JOE: Do n't you know , that 's what I want more than anything . He touches her face .
SUSAN: You said before you could n't tell me who or where , only the 'when ' Is when now ? A moment .
JOE: May I kiss you ?
SUSAN: That felt like a goodbye . Joe 's silence is heavy . SUSAN What 's going on , Joe ? I feel like we 're lifting off
JOE: I 'm still here .
SUSAN: But you 're not . You 're somewhere else . You 're someone else
JOE: I love you now , I 'll love you always
SUSAN: Hold me
JOE: Susan
SUSAN: Yes ?
JOE: Thank you for loving me . She smiles wanly , Joe leaves her .
PARRISH: Thank you .
QUINCE: I got him . The chopper 's two minutes away . Parrish weighs the information for a moment .
PARRISH: How are we on time ? Joe shrugs , nods gently .
JOE: Okay .
PARRISH: Get him in here .
DREW: This is damn big of Bill , I also think it 's smart .
QUINCE: He had no choice . You 're a formidable adversary .
DREW: He said that ?
QUINCE: Well , you 've got him by the short- hairs .
DREW: Yeah , the short , gray hairs .
PARRISH: I appreciate this , Eddie , members of the Board , this will just take a minute of your time . As the custo- dians of the company , you may re- ceive information from what follows that is valuable to you or not . Either way , thanks .
DREW: Hi , Bill , happy birthday A moment . DREW I just wanted to say how appre- ciative I am of this - uh - grand gesture and
PARRISH: Shut up and sit down . Drew takes a seat . PARRISH You 're a worthless sack of shit , you fucked me over , played footsie with John Bontecou , sold my company out to line your own pockets .
DREW: I do n't know where you get that idea the Board agreed
PARRISH: The Board did n't know you 're a mole who burrowed inside so you could bury us all .
DREW: Is this Mr. Black 's fantasy ? Anothe one of his whoppers ? Are n't you sick of this asshole lurking around ? No one knows who he is , but one thing everyone does know , he somehow got your ear and has been pouring poison into it ever since . Joe can no longer control himself .
JOE: You 're the poison , Drew . You 've operated behind-the-scenes to suborn the trust of a man who has stamped you with his imprimatur of class and elegance and stature . I 've seen all kinds and degrees of deception in my time , but Bill Parrish has been on the receiving end of machinations so Machiavellian that it has rarely een my experience to encounter . And yet he has combatted them stoically , and selflessly , without revealing my identity . Had he violated the vow of secrecy he took , his task would have been far easier , he could have turned defeat into victory , but he is too honorable a man to have done that . And now I must release him from that vow . Because of me , he has lost his work , his company , his eputation and now he 's going to tell you who I am .
DREW: So tell me , tell me , I 'm peeing in my pants .
JOE: And now you 're going to pee some more .
PARRISH: Joe , do n't do this
JOE: It 's time to put this person where he belongs .
PARRISH: It 's not necessary , Joe . Drew 's going to step aside
DREW: I 'm not stepping anywhere
JOE: I appreciate your gentlemanliness , Bill , but what we need to do here is drive the dagger home
DREW: The dagger ?
PARRISH: I told you to shut up .
JOE: Prepare yourself , Drew - I am
PARRISH: He is
JOE: I 'll take it from here I am
PARRISH: An IRS man .
JOE: Yes , I am . IRS man .
PARRISH: The Treasury Department asked my cooperation in his undercove investigation of John Bontecou . They were convinced that Bontecou , on past deals , had structured his mergers and acquisitions in sus- picious and complicated ways so as to evade paying the taxes he is liable for . The IRS wanted to go after him , and this deal offered them the opportunity . I agreed to cooperate .
JOE: And we 're very grateful .
PARRISH: Moreover , Agent Joe Black here of course that 's not his real name smelled out your involvement , Drew . He developed evidence you were working both sides of the fence . Unfortunately , that 's known as a conflict of interest
JOE: Undisclosed conflict of interest
PARRISH: An offense
JOE: An indictable offense . Silence .
DREW: I think I 'd like to talk to my lawyer
PARRISH: No lawyers , Drew . We 're going to offer you a deal . Drew is all attention . PARRISH Confess to the Board every details of your participation and then submit your resignation .
DREW: And what do I get ?
PARRISH: You get not to go to jail .
DREW: You 're talking through your hat . You 're offering a deal because you 've got no proof .
PARRISH: Proof ? We 've got plenty of proof .
JOE: And he 's talking through his lips . Joe steps forward . JOE Make no mistake , Drew , if you choose to test my resolve in this matter , you 'll be looking at an outcome that will have a finality that is beyond your comprehension , and you 'll not e counting the days or the months or the years , but millenniums in the house with no doors . Drew slumps .
DREW: All right , you win . As soon as I get back to the city , I 'll meet with the Board . Sloane 's voice erupts over the SPEAKERPHONE .
PARRISH: Well , thank you , that 's great , but it 's more than I bargained for . I just wanted to set the record straight .
JOE: My pleasure . This is an IRS Agent 's dream . I 'll be promoted to Chief of Section off of this .
DREW: Who would 've ever believed it ? You , an IRS Agent Silence . Joe shrugs , smiles .
JOE: 'Death and Taxes ' .
ALLISON: Daddy ! We 've been looking all ove for you - this is your party - what are you doing in here ? Never mind . You 're on . Let 's go .
PARRISH: I thought I was going to sneak away tonight YELLS of `` No ! '' `` Never ! '' PARRISH What a glorious night , every face I see is a memory . It may not e a perfectly perfect memory sometimes we had our ups and downs but we 're all together , and you 're mine for a night . And I 'm going to break precedent , and tell you my one-candle wish that you would have a life as lucky as mine , where you can wake up one morning and say `` I do n't want anything more . '' Sixty-five years - do n't they go by in a blink ?
SUSAN: What a night .
PARRISH: I 'm having a helluva time . A moment .
SUSAN: You were right about Joe , he is going somewhere
PARRISH: I 'm sorry . Susan is examining Parrish very closely .
SUSAN: Are you relieved ?
PARRISH: Yes , but Parrish hesitates .
SUSAN: But what ?
PARRISH: I want you to know how much I love you . That you 've given a meaning to my life that I had no right to expect , and that no one can eve take from me .
SUSAN: Daddy
PARRISH: No I love you so much and I want you to promise me something . I do n't want you to ever worry about me . If anything should happen , I 'm going to be fine and everything 's going to be all right . And I have no regrets .
SUSAN: I love you , Daddy
PARRISH: That 's why it 's okay . They drift into silence . PARRISH No regrets ? After a moment .
SUSAN: 'No regrets ' . A long silence , Susan smiles .
PARRISH: It 's a good feeling , is n't it ? Silence again .
SUSAN: Everybody 's saying goodbye
PARRISH: I 'm still here . Would you like to dance with me , Susan ?
SUSAN: Oh , yes
PARRISH: If you do n't mind dancing with an old fogey like me .
SUSAN: Oh , Dad , you 're not old . You 'll never be old . He takes her in his arms and they dance away .
WAITER: Can I get you anything , sir ? Joe regards the Waiter for a moment .
JOE: Do you have any peanut butter ? The Waiter hesitates .
WAITER: I do n't think so , sir .
JOE: Thank you , anyway .
PARRISH: What was that ?
SUSAN: The fireworks are about to start .
PARRISH: You go ahead , honey , I 'm going to catch my breath .
JOE: Happy Birthday , Bill .
PARRISH: Thank you .
JOE: Not exactly .
PARRISH: I guess you have your reasons .
JOE: Yes . Silence .
PARRISH: Now that we have a moment , would you mind if I expressed my gratitude fo what you did for Susan ? Joe waits . PARRISH I never heard her speak of any man as she spoke of you It was always what I wanted for her but what happens to her now ?
JOE: I would n't worry about it , Bill . These things have a way of working out .
PARRISH: Do n't blow smoke up my ass , you 'll uin my autopsy .
JOE: Yes .
PARRISH: That 's life . What can I tell you ?
PARRISH: I 'm getting a little dizzy , I can feel my heart pumping
JOE: Not a man like you .
SUSAN: Joe ?
JOE: You bet .
SUSAN: Where did you go ?
JOE: I do n't know y'know , I do n't know it 's all blurred up and hazy . And would y'know what I mean if I said I do n't think it 's worth figuring out ?
SUSAN: That 's it ?
JOE: Well , I do n't know what else to say . It 's a helluva party
SUSAN: You think so ?
JOE: Yeahand you 're the prettie thing here .
YOUNG MAN: Hey , you all right ?
SUSAN: The coffee shop
YOUNG MAN: I asked you if I said something wrong and you said it was so right it scared you . Susan holds herself very still . YOUNG MAN And forgive me for saying this ut then you said and it 's been with me ever since
SUSAN: What has ? He hesitates .
YOUNG MAN: You said you liked me .
SUSAN: No
YOUNG MAN: Y'did n't ? A moment .
SUSAN: I said I liked you so much .
YOUNG MAN: Hey , everything 's going great do n't y'think ? She does n't answer for a moment . YOUNG MAN Do n't you feel that way ?
SUSAN: We know so little about each other .
YOUNG MAN: But we 've got time .
SUSAN: I wish you could 've known my father Another moment .
YOUNG MAN: Me , too .
SUSAN: What do we do now ? A long silence .
YOUNG MAN: It will come to us .
UBERMAN: You look so peaceful from up here .
EINSTEIN: I hate the outfits . I mean , I get it we 're all supposed to be `` masterminds '' - very clever .
PLATO: Theory of relativity .
EINSTEIN: Well , you 'd think he 'd invent a wool sweater that did n't itch so much .
MASTER MIND: The real Einstein once said , `` God does not play dice with the world . '' He was right , because the world is MY dice . Is that understood ?
EINSTEIN: Yes , sir .
MASTER MIND: Alright , then - clean slate . Do we have the girl ?
DA VINCI: Yes , sir . She fell into our trap just like you knew she would .
MASTER MIND: Reporters are a curious lot , and easily manipulated .
ROXANNE: You did n't need to turn around like that . I can recognize the stench of failure . Master Mind unleashes a wicked laugh .
MASTER MIND: I trust you gentlemen know the very sassy Roxanne Ritchi , highly egarded investigative journalist who some say has a more than friendly relationship with ou super powered foe Uberman . And Miss Ritchi , I trust you 've already met my new crew The Mad Geniuses ! Roxanne gives Einstein a once over .
ROXANNE: Looks like a real group of winners . At the risk of sounding cliche ' , you 'll never get away with this .
MASTER MIND: In a way , I already have . Roxanne unleashes an exhausted SIGH .
ROXANNE: We go through this every time . You kidnap me to get to Uberman , he immediately finds your hideout , escapes whatever lame trap you 've come up with , and takes you and your cronies to jail . I propose we just save everybody some heartache this time by YOU letting me go , and ME forgetting this whole thing eve happened ?
MASTER MIND: What about my revenge ?
ROXANNE: We can say it was wasting everyone 's time .
MASTER MIND: You have a wicked tongue . I hope you rid yourself of that when you 're my queen . Roxanne unleashes a snort-filled laugh .
ROXANNE: I 'm sorry . What makes you think I would want to be your queen ?
MASTER MIND: Power corrupts absolutely , Miss Ritchi . And when I have ultimate power over this city , I have absolutely every intention of corrupting you with it .
PLATO: Sir !
MASTER MIND: What is it ! ?
UBERMAN: Master Mind !
PLATO: We 're now at minimum safe distance , master .
MASTER MIND: Excellent . Stop here , I like this view .
PLATO: Twenty seconds until impact .
MASTER MIND: Any last words ?
PLATO: Ten seconds to impact .
MASTER MIND: What 's going on ?
UBERMAN: Holdona second .
PLATO: Seven
UBERMAN: SON OF A BITCH ! !
DA VINCI: What did he just say ?
PLATO: SixFive Master Mind begins to laugh .
MASTER MIND: What kind of trick is this ?
UBERMAN: Like you do n't know . These bars are made of copper , are n't they ?
PLATO: Four
MASTER MIND: Yeah , so ?
UBERMAN: You figured out my weakness , damn you . I CA N'T BEND COPPER !
PLATO: Three
MASTER MIND: Your weakness is copper ?
PLATO: Twoone . Everyone turns to the window .
EINSTEIN: Whoa ! Is it me or did you just finally destroy Uberman ?
MASTER MIND: Welllet 's not get ahead of ourselves . Da Vinci suddenly sees something outside .
DA VINCI: Look , there 's something in the sky , coming this way .
ROXANNE: Uberman ! Master Mind turns toward the window .
ROXANNE: Uberman ?
EINSTEIN: You did it !
MASTER MIND: so I did .
EINSTEIN: I mean , I know you always wanted to . I mean , all the schemes all the plots - I never thought you 'd actually be capable of it .
MASTER MIND: Oh , right .
HAL: It 's a sport of honor , focus and grace . Honor the ball , focus on the pins , release the ball not hard and fast , but as if you were releasing a baby dove .
ATTRACTIVE BLOND: Tell me how my form looks , honey .
HAL: Oh , it 's lookin ' good . It 's lookin ' REAL good .
VINNIE: Now !
HAL: Fired ? Are you going to tell me why ?
VINNIE: Showing up to work late . Showing up to work late drunk . Sexually harassing customers . Stealing from the register .
HAL: Vinnie , I do n't know where you 're getting these accusations -
VINNIE: This is all of them at once .
HAL: I 've got this one , Benny . So , Cinderella . Can I help you find your glass slipper ?
WOMAN: Yeah , I 'm looking for a seven .
HAL: Seven - Well , maybe I could interest you in something in an EIGHT . Namely , me . Disgusted , she walks off screen .
VINNIE: Um , I do n't know . Maybe somebody who can actually bowl . You guys have never won a game . I hired you ecause you said you were on the pro circuit .
HAL: No , I said I WILL BE on the pro circuit .
VINNIE: Please , a loser like you will neve amount to anything .
HAL: WowIf that 's how you feelI guess we should then talk about what kind of severance I 'm gon na get .
ROXANNE: It'sumIt 's good to be back . Thanks for everyone 's cards and concerns . I really appreciated it - now I 'm ready to climb back on the horse .
FRANK: Someone die or something ?
ROXANNE: It 's okay .
FRANK: Come on into my office , sweetie .
ROXANNE: Are n't you ?
FRANK: Yeah , but I do n't want people to think it .
ROXANNE: Frank , listen . I want to go back to work . I NEED to go back to work .
FRANK: You 're hysterical , are n't you ?
ROXANNE: What 're you doing ?
FRANK: Keeping you warm before you go into shock .
ROXANNE: It was a traumatic experience . Yes , everyone knows Uberman and me wereclose . But what I really need - what would really make me etter is getting back to work . There 's a sudden awkward silence from Frank .
FRANK: Well , that 's going to be
ROXANNE: I thought you 'd be happy to have me ack .
FRANK: Oh , we are . Honey , nothing makes us happier than to have our girl back , ut
ROXANNE: Yes ?
FRANK: Things have sortachanged .
ROXANNE: In three weeks ?
FRANK: Listen , I 'm not one who likes to open up wounds - especially ones that are just starting to scab , but you were sorta our go to girl fo the exclusive on Uberman . And now that he 's goneI moved Brad into your anchor spot .
ROXANNE: Brad ? Brad Helms ? The man is an idiot .
FRANK: It 's the suits . They think it 's time to switch things up .
ROXANNE: Oh , because they ca n't use me to get the big story .
FRANK: C'mon , Roxie . Using is in the nature of what we do . They used you , you used Uberman . Everybody 's happy .
ROXANNE: I did n't use him .
FRANK: Oh , I did n't mean that . I know you two were in love or something . My ad .
ROXANNE: We were .
FRANK: And that 's great .
ROXANNE: Very in love .
FRANK: Human interest .
ROXANNE: Bake sales and pet stories .
FRANK: I told them I would n't be surprised if you just upped and quit . You usted your ass for that desk .
ROXANNE: I 'll take it .
FRANK: What ?
EINSTEIN: Just robbed the diamond exchange .
MASTER MIND: Great , great . Put it on the pile .
EINSTEIN: Anything else today ?
MASTER MIND: No .
PLATO: Sir , the new reactor is installed . Plato nods to the giant orb .
MASTER MIND: Maybe later .
PLATO: Sir , I ca n't help but notice that you 've beena little down lately .
MASTER MIND: When I want your opinion I 'll beat it out of you .
PLATO: Yes , sir , I know , but please forgive my impertinence . It 's just that you seem to have lost you lust for our profession . You 've stopped going on jobs and spend most of your time watching Uberman specials .
MASTER MIND: I have defeated my greatest enemy . I have free reign over Metro City . I have more wealth than a thousand Sultans . I 've achieved all I have worked forso why am I so unhappy ?
PLATO: I sort of have a theory about all that .
MASTER MIND: Oh , really ?
PLATO: Well , for one thing , maybe Uberman was more important to you than you thought .
MASTER MIND: He was a worthy rival . Sometimes I wonder , did he consider me his evil equal or was I just an annoying , little gnat to him ? What 's the second part ?
PLATO: I think you sort of have a thing for Roxanne Ritchi .
PLATO: Sir , your plans always involve Ms. Ritchi either being kidnapped o placed in danger . If that 's not love , I do n't know what is . It 's the grown up equivalent of dipping her pigtails in the ink well . Do n't you see ? She 's the one treasure that 's always escaped you .
FRIEND #1: I ca n't believe you came back so soon .
FRIEND #2: Are you sure it 's not TOO SOON , honey ?
ROXANNE: I just wanted to get back to work .
FRIEND #3: What we need to do is get you back on the saddlethe love saddle . Friend 1 and 2 give 3 disapproving looks .
FRIEND #2: She just lost the love of her life , Grace .
ROXANNE: I keep trying to tell people it was n't really like that . Uberman and I - We were kinda having problems . We broke up .
FRIEND #1: You broke up with Uberman !
FRIEND #3: You must have REALLY , REALLY high standards . I mean , you were dating a god . I mean , what 's it take ?
ROXANNE: Maybe someone who 's a little more aware of his faults . Someone a little more sensitive .
FRIEND #3: Right . Someone who listens , sexy ut attainable with cute little cheeks like a hamster and heartbreak in his eyes . She turns to Friend one and two to explain .
FRIEND #2: The actor ?
FRIEND #3: No , the famous pediatrist - Yes , the actor . Ever since we were teenagers , Roxanne 's totally had the hots for him .
ROXANNE: Well , until he miraculously comes walking into my life , I 'm just going to take a little reflection time for myself .
MASTER MIND: Who the hell is John Cusack ?
POLITICIAN: The Fifth Avenue Renovation Project , which I championed , will eath new life into the downtown area . New life means new jobs and new revenue .
ROXANNE: Councilman , is it true that you other-in-law 's construction company won the contract for this project ?
POLITICIAN: Welleryes , butlook I 'm not here to answer a lot of crazy questions
YOUNG MOTHER: Thank you ! Thank you for saving me and my baby !
HAL: Huh ?
ROXANNE: What 's it feel like to be a hero ?
HAL: WellI 'm just a man doing what men do . You 're Roxanne Ritchi , are n't you ?
REPORTER: Were you scared ?
HAL: Scared ? Who had time ? The reporters eat this up .
MASTER MIND: John Cusack , huh ? So all I have to do is have a cute puppy dog stare , e willing to make a fool of myself and - Oh , REMOVE BOTH MY BALLS .
ROXANNE: Shit .
"JOHN CUSACK": Oh the humanity - it was a Venti .
ROXANNE: You'reyou 're .
"JOHN CUSACK": Yes , it 's me . John Cusackthe actor .
ROXANNE: Yes . I mean , excuse me ?
"JOHN CUSACK": Can I fill you up ? Your coffee .
ROXANNE: Right .
"JOHN CUSACK": Yeah , they charge way too much at these places - Now back to you oyfriend . I 'm interested and compassionate . I want to know about you .
ROXANNE: Things were complicated . He was a man married to his work . There wasthere was a lot of competition in his line of usiness . I 'm sure you know what that 's like .
"JOHN CUSACK": Sure . In my business , one thing I have is RIVALS . For example , mine isuhLou Ferrigno .
ROXANNE: The body-builder who used to play The Hulk on TV ?
"JOHN CUSACK": Did he ? Well , we 're always up fo the same roles . Did your boyfriend have someone like that ? A particular rival that was always getting his goat - so to speak ?
ROXANNE: Wellone rival in particula seemed to get more of his attention than I ever did . But enough about my problems .
"JOHN CUSACK": NO , TELL ME MORE ! ! !
ROXANNE: Right , well , he seemed to need him more than he needed me .
"JOHN CUSACK": How do you mean ?
ROXANNE: It was conflict he thrived on . He always said he would n't know what to do with himself if Master - I mean , this guy were gone . It was like he needed it , like oxygen .
"JOHN CUSACK": I think I finally understandThe only logical answer is to recreate that rivalry - or if that 's impossible , create one of equal structure . That 's it !
ROXANNE: What ?
"JOHN CUSACK": Oh , sorry , sorry . Just rehearsing for a partwhere I play a man who talks to himself at inappropriate times . In a sudden rush , he rises out of his chair .
ROXANNE: I 'd love that .
EINSTEIN: Got her nose !
MASTER MIND: I 've got it !
EINSTEIN: Yeah , maybe that 's not such hot idea
MASTER MIND: Prepare for Operation Superhero Genesis !
SEVERS: I feel fine . Just a little sticky , ut aside from that everything 's completely -
MASTER MIND: Okay then .
PLATO: We attached gills to him . He can eath under water .
MASTER MIND: Ah . Does he have extraordinary strength ?
PLATO: Wellno .
MASTER MIND: Can he fly ?
PLATO: No .
MASTER MIND: Resilient to weapons fire ?
PLATO: No .
MASTER MIND: He just breathes under water , then .
PLATO: Ahyeah .
MASTER MIND: Plato , the radioactive spider , please .
STENWICK: Ow ! He brushes the spider off .
MASTER MIND: Anything , Stenwick ?
STENWICK: No . Ahsir , I did n't know this was about spiders . I have a pretty severe case of arachnophobia .
MASTER MIND: We 're gon na need more venom .
EINSTEIN: Yeah , well , it sounds like what you want is Uberman .
MASTER MIND: That 's it ! Why make a copy when the eal thing will do ?
EINSTEIN: I was just kidding , sir . In case you forgot , you actually burned Uberman alive .
MASTER MIND: Then we 'll make a new one . Plato , ing me the box !
MASTER MIND: Behold - Uberessence . The very thing that gave Uberman his superhuman powers .
EINSTEIN: Where the hell did you get that ?
MASTER MIND: Oh , I shot him with a power sucking gun and had this idea to use this to clone a whole army of evil Ubermen . I 'm not sure why I neve got around to following up with that .
PLATO: I believe he defeated you before you could , master .
MASTER MIND: Right . Man , he was good !
DA VINCI: You want another volunteer , sir ?
MASTER MIND: Not another volunteer driven by the need for personal gain . Somebody else , somebody pure .
NEWS REPORTER: who risked his own life to save that of a young mother and he child .
HAL: Please , please , you 're embarrassing me . I saw someone in need and I helped them . What more can we ask of ourselves . I ask you , what more ? A smile creeps across the evil one 's face .
PLATO: Yeah , sir . This guy is a real piece of work . He used to teach bowling at Kingpin 's .
MASTER MIND: A modest profession to brilliantly hide his true heroic nature . I love it .
PLATO: Then you are absolutely going to love this -
MASTER MIND: He volunteers . He does n't ask fo any reward for his deeds . The fates are shining down on me . This Mr. Stewart is truly an unselfish soul .
HAL: You greedy little bastard . I already gave you a twenty .
BLIND KID: Hey , you want me to play along ? Then pay up , bitch !
HAL: Fine , but you better be convincing .
BLIND KID: Why ca n't I see ! Why God ?
HAL: Hey , Peter . C'mon champ , let me look at you .
BLIND KID: You really think so , Hal ?
HAL: Hey , does it LOOK like I 'm lying ? Now c'mon , go feel your way to class before you get your little utt suspended . The boy stands up and is about to take off .
PLATO: I think I 've seen enough , sir . This is your guy .
HAL: Oh , there it is again . This is eally getting embarrassing now .
TRUCKER#1: Let me tell you something . That was just about the bravest damn thing I 've ever witnessed . Hey , everybody ! This guy 's the hero from
TRUCKER#1: I want to give you something .
ATTRACTIVE WOMAN: Hey , you 're on TV again . The crowd looks up at the Television .
BRAD HELMS: This just in . Upon a second look at that tape from this morning , which we 'll now replay for you , it appears it was not the heroic act it first seemed to be . The tape shows Hal running in slow motion .
HAL: I guess that looks kinda bad . Trucker # 1 snatches his medal back .
DA VINCI: There he is , boss .
MASTER MIND: Now , we 're sure this wo n't kill him ?
PLATO: Yes , sir . He 'll just feel a slight electrical shock .
MASTER MIND: Good .
HAL: God , I hate the weather in this city .
MASTER MIND: Follow him .
CAT: You do n't look so good , man .
HAL: I do n't feel good . I was struck by freaking lightening .
CAT: No , you 're just hallucinating . By the way , we 're out of orange juice .
HAL: AAAAAAHHHHH !
HAL: Wait ! He starts running after it .
MASTER MIND: Welcome to your second birth , Hal Stewart .
"PAT MORITA": Perfect .
HAL: Who are you ! ?
VOICE: I am the guide on your journey . Fate has chosen you to be it 's champion . Pat Morita steps out from the shadows . Hal passes out again .
HAL: Thank God . It was a dream . Man , I must be losing it . A voice sounds right next to his ear .
"PAT MORITA": Calm . All things must be filtered through calmness .
HAL: Bullshit ! Sometimes it 's best to freak out .
"PAT MORITA": I think we must work on you attitude first .
HAL: Look I 'm gon na call the cops in about two seconds if you do n't get out of here .
"PAT MORITA": Are you calm now ?
HAL: Yeah , I 'm okay . Pat slaps him across the face hard .
"PAT MORITA": Good , because we 've got a lot of work to do . Hal grabs his jaw .
HAL: What the hell was that for ?
"PAT MORITA": Rule number one expect the unexpected .
HAL: Can you just tell me what this is all about ?
"PAT MORITA": The heavens are not in the habit of estowing a gift such as this to just anyone . You are being rewarded for being a man of great moral fortitude with an unwavering belief in humanity .
HAL: That 's me alright .
"PAT MORITA": I am to train you so you may fulfill your destiny to defeat the great menace to Metro City Maste Mind . Pat gets up and walks toward the door .
HAL: We 're are we going ?
"PAT MORITA": To train .
"PAT MORITA": Hey , Corky ? You listening ?
HAL: Yeah , work both muscles .
"PAT MORITA": Trust me .
HAL: What are you doing ! ?
"PAT MORITA": An invulnerability test . Something wrong ?
HAL: Uhyeah . I would prefer not to get shot . Do not fire that thing ! Frustrated , Pat lowers the gun .
"PAT MORITA": You 're bulletproof .
HAL: Okay , do you know that for sure ? Pat quickly aims and fires .
"PAT MORITA": I do now .
HAL: You suck .
"PAT MORITA": Hey !
HAL: What ?
"PAT MORITA": What did I tell you ? Stomach down , hands up .
HAL: God , I feel so gay .
"PAT MORITA": What is it ?
HAL: YEEEE HAWWWW !
"PAT MORITA": Yes , it 's John Cusack .
HAL: WHOOOOA ! Man , that is so cool . It 's like fly - Oh my God , I almost said it was like flying .
"PAT MORITA": For the rest of the day I want you to continue to practice your flying posture .
HAL: Why , where 're ya going ?
"PAT MORITA": To do somethingmysterious and Asian .
HAL: Say no more , bro . I 'll just keep at it , then .
ROXANNE: How 's your sandwich ?
"JOHN CUSACK": It 's quite delicious .
ROXANNE: Hope you do n't think I 'm too forward . Some men are intimidated when a woman asks them out . I just find you really easy to talk to .
"JOHN CUSACK": And I you .
ROXANNE: You know , you 're not at all like you are in the movies .
"JOHN CUSACK": I 'm not ?
ROXANNE: Yeah . I do n't know - You have this strange , refined way of speaking .
"JOHN CUSACK": I do ? That is most interesting .
ROXANNE: Anyway , when we were talking the other day I just felt , even though we only talked for a couple of hours , that we 've known each othe for years .
"JOHN CUSACK": I know just what you mean . Roxanne bites into her sandwich .
ROXANNE: You know what ? This sandwich is disgusting . She tosses it in a nearby garbage can .
"JOHN CUSACK": It means you do n't give up on a sandwich . You see that it has potential , and you give it every chance to be all it can be . Roxanne smiles at his analogy .
ROXANNE: Thanks , but knowing me , I was probably projecting my expectations of what a lunch should be on the sandwich . It might have been okay at first , but I just made it itter .
"JOHN CUSACK": Is that what happened with you last sandwich - I mean , boyfriend ?
ROXANNE: When I look back , I probably should n't of expected so much from him . He was already a giving person . You know , one of those go out and save the world types .
"JOHN CUSACK": I 've run into a few .
ROXANNE: I was selfish , I guess . I did n't want to share him with anybody else .
"JOHN CUSACK": It sounds like he was a special man .
ROXANNE: They broke the mold .
"JOHN CUSACK": Perhaps not .
TITAN: What 's the `` T '' stand for ?
"PAT MORITA": Titan .
TITAN: What 's that supposed to mean ?
"PAT MORITA": It 's from Roman mythology . Zeus 's fatheroh , just go with it . You look perfect .
TITAN: I do n't think this mask is big enough . Are you sure no one is gon na recognize me ?
"PAT MORITA": It 's fine , just do n't slouch . It 's all in the posture . He grabs Titan 's shoulders like a proud papa .
JOHN: Alright folks , this is a robbery . Nobody moves - yadda , yadda , yadda
GEORGE: The safe . Let 's go .
BANK MANAGER: Okay , just do n't hurt anyone .
GEORGE: Yeah , yeah , yeah . George leads him out by the collar .
TITAN: Well , boys , there 's no need for all this just to get the free toaster . Paul cocks his gun .
PAUL: What are you suppose to be ? We move in for a nice dramatic close up .
TITAN: Justice .
GEORGE: Well , justice , suck on this George , John and Paul open fire on Titan .
TITAN: Now it 's my turn . He turns to George .
HAL: Well , Ringoumumyou 're under arrest .
BANK MANAGER: On behalf of the First National Bank of Metro City , I 'd like to offer you a reward for your act of avery . He hands Titan a check .
TITAN: Ten thousand dollars !
BRAD HELMS: This story 's mine .
ROXANNE: Listen , Brad . We were just in the area . I was just trying to -
BRAD HELMS: I 've been in this business long enough to know pretty well what you were `` just trying to do . '' Besides , I heard you could n't take the big game anymore and were put on fluff detail ?
SETH: You 're not gon na take that from him , are you ?
ROXANNE: He 's right . Old habit , I guess . We 'll get out of your way .
BRAD HELMS: Besides , I 'm sure there 's a pancake supper somewhere that needs covering .
BRAD HELMS: For months now , since the death of Uberman , the citizens of Metro City have been holding out for a hero . Well , it appears they wo n't have to hold out for much longer as a new costumed crusader has suddenly stormed onto the scene . Today , at the Metro Savings and Trust , a masked mystery man single-handedly defeated `` The Fab Four Gang . '' Just who is this new caped avenger ? Brad holds the microphone to Titan 's face .
TITAN: It 's a message to all the scum out there . Uberman may be gone , but Metro City has a new protector , and his name is `` Tighten ! '' Another reporter leans in .
REPORTER: How do you spell that ?
MASTER MIND: Oh , for heaven 's sake . I ca n't elieve it . He misspelled his name .
EINSTEIN: Yeah , if the plan is getting us in jail .
MASTER MIND: You know , Einstein , maybe I should have called you Socrates . He also did n't know when to keep his thoughts to himself .
EINSTEIN: I just fail to see the point in all of this . I mean , why are we creating another superhero when it was such a pain in the ass for you to get rid of the other one ? I mean , Uberman is destroyed , we should be using this opportunity toto
MASTER MIND: To what ?
EINSTEIN: I do n't know . To take over the weather , space , the world - whatever super villains are SUPPOSED to do .
MASTER MIND: The reason someone like you will always be a minion is because you have no foresight . We take over the earth , like you said . Then what ? Women ? Cars ? Money ? Even the grandest treasures will lose thei lustre if you do n't have someone to hold them over .
EINSTEIN: That 's it ! This balance of the force bullshit is getting way too Oprah for me . I 'm blowing . Who 's with me ?
MASTER MIND: You dare ?
EINSTEIN: Yeah , I dare . I 'm sick of wearing stupid costumes , and I 'm sick of working for a super villain who 's turning into a softie .
MASTER MIND: What - did - you - call me ?
EINSTEIN: You heard me . You used to be an inhuman monster , now look at you . You 're creating super heroes , you do n't go with us on robberies anymore , it 's been days since you threatened anyone , oh , and not to mention this Roxanne Ritchi thing .
MASTER MIND: THAT is none of your business , knave !
EINSTEIN: Hey , you guys have n't sealed the deal yet , have you ?
MASTER MIND: Silence !
EINSTEIN: Oh , Master , your head is so big .
MASTER MIND: I 'm warning you , Einstein .
EINSTEIN: Take me !
MASTER MIND: I said silence !
ROXANNE: Do n't get me wrong , I love being a eporter . I do n't think I could do anything else . It 's the consequences of what we do that I 'm having a problem with .
"JOHN CUSACK": That 's where journalistic esponsibility comes in , no ?
ROXANNE: It 's supposed to .
"JOHN CUSACK": Sounds to me like you 're running from something .
ROXANNE: I got someone I cared about killed . If it was n't for me , he would n't have been involved .
"JOHN CUSACK": You ca n't blame yourself . My fathe used to say each of us must answe the great call to truly feel alive .
ROXANNE: Was he an actor ?
"JOHN CUSACK": No . He wasa landscaper . And a horrible one . I mean he would fail time and time again at hislandscaping . And sometimes he 'd get pretty beaten up or thrown in jail -
ROXANNE: Jail ?
"JOHN CUSACK": My point is he took the good with the bad . He grew a little each time . Improved , learned .
ROXANNE: Was he ever successful ?
"JOHN CUSACK": God , nobut do n't let deter you . Roxanne LAUGHS .
ROXANNE: Thanks for this . You know , this is embarrassing , but it 's been a long time since I -
"JOHN CUSACK": What were you gon na say ?
ROXANNE: Oh , I was gon na sayIt 's been a long time sincewell , I 've been with someone Ienjoy being with .
"JOHN CUSACK": To people who enjoy being with each other .
ROXANNE: Oh my God .
MASTER MIND: You 're not gon na get all freaky about this , are you ?
ROXANNE: Thisthis is too much , even fo you . God , I go out with you , tell you my innermost thoughts .
MASTER MIND: I only did this because I wanted to talk to you on the same level . You know , without all the baggage ?
ROXANNE: Baggage ? You burned my boyfriend alive , you sick son-of-a-bitch !
MASTER MIND: You see , that 's exactly what I 'm talking about . Roxanne starts to walk away .
ROXANNE: Stay away from me .
MASTER MIND: What ?
ROXANNE: Damn .
MASTER MIND: Hello , Triple A ?
SHOPKEEPER: Hey !
SHOTGUN HOODLUM: Shut up , Gramps .
ROXANNE: I do n't think so . The Hoodlum cocks his shotgun .
SHOTGUN HOODLUM: I said give it to me !
MASTER MIND: No , it 's a goo gun . The hoodlum turns his gun to Master Mind .
SHOTGUN HOODLUM: Yeah , what 's it do ?
MASTER MIND: It goos .
SHOPKEEPER: I know you ! You Master Brain guy . You a hero . Master Mind points the goo gun at him .
MASTER MIND: Do n't - EVER - say that again .
ROXANNE: Hey ! Master Mind turns around .
MASTER MIND: Do n't flatter yourself .
ROXANNE: Do n't walk away from me when I 'm talking to you . Finally it occurs to her what 's going on .
MASTER MIND: My , someone has a rather high opinion of themselves .
ROXANNE: Do you really think I would be with someone like you ?
MASTER MIND: No .
PLATO: Everything alright , sir ?
MASTER MIND: Fine , why do you ask ?
PLATO: Youjustseem Master Mind tightens his grip .
MASTER MIND: Go on .
PLATO: distracted . Master Mind releases him .
MASTER MIND: Just with business , my minion . Just with business . I 've decided it is time .
PLATO: You mean ?
MASTER MIND: Yes , we 've created our hero , now it 's time to give him a little motivation .
DA VINCI: How do we do that ?
MASTER MIND: To be simply good is not enough . A hero must be driven by an almost elentless desire to right a wrong that can never be corrected .
PLATO: You mean ?
MASTER MIND: Yes , he must lose someone near and dear to him - his father figure . Gentlemen , it 's time for Operation Mentor Kill !
TITAN: Man , what the hell happened down there ? Wait a sec -
"PAT MORITA": I 'm dying , kid . There is just one last lesson I have for you . It is the most important of all .
TITAN: What 's that ?
"PAT MORITA": Master Mind did this , you must avenge me .
TITAN: Master Mind ? Why ?
"PAT MORITA": Because he 's evil . You must stop the evil Hal - stop the Pat 's body goes limp .
REPORTER 1: Tighten , Is this the work of Maste Mind ?
REPORTER 2: How will the death of your mento affect your resolve ?
REPORTER 3: Was that Pat Morita ? Titan walks up to one of the cameras .
TITAN: This injustice will not go unpunished . Master Mind , if you can hear me , Tighten is coming for you .
MASTER MIND: Alright , people , we do n't have much time . Titan should be here any minute , so let 's get the lead out .
DA VINCI: Nearly up to full power , sir .
MASTER MIND: Hum . Let 's turn it down a few notches . It 's his first time and we do n't want to get in a lucky shot , now do we ? Plato enters the room .
PLATO: Not yet , sir .
MASTER MIND: I see . Well , he must be planning something big . Are the flame androids deployed ?
PLATO: All twelve .
MASTER MIND: Wonderful , wonderful . Plato , Da Vinci , take your places next to me . They move to either side of the chair .
PLATO: He 's certainly taking his time .
MASTER MIND: He 'll be here . That 's the way it works .
TITAN: Oh , for crying out loud .
MASTER MIND: Do you know who I am ?
TITAN: Yeah , you 're Master Mind . Yeah ! You 're actually the guy I want to see !
MASTER MIND: Oh , so NOW you want to get down to it . Well , I want to get a few things off my chest first .
TITAN: Well , at first I was going to . You know , because that 's what I figured I was supposed to do . But then I got to thinking-
MASTER MIND: -You got to thinking ? There 's nothing to think about . I 'm the villain . I do something bad , you come and get me .
TITAN: - I got to thinkingwhat 's the point ? Master Mind throws up his hands .
MASTER MIND: Maybe you 're right . What 's the point ?
TITAN: That 's what I wanted to talk to you about .
MASTER MIND: Where did you get all this ?
TITAN: Get this I stole them .
MASTER MIND: From where ?
TITAN: From all over . You see , once you killed Pat and ruined my othe apartment building I was pretty pissed off , so I figured I 'd go , find you and kick some ass . Then I thought to myself `` Okay , then what ? '' I mean , if we were to fight , what would I get out of it ? Would I get my apartment back ? Would I be able to pay the bills ?
MASTER MIND: Well , what about your mentor ?
TITAN: Tell you the truth ? He was kind of a dick . I mean , being a hero is dandy and all , but it 's voluntee work . Now you 've always had the ight take on all this . I mean , when you rob a bank or take ove the diamond exchange you get something out of it . I mean , when you do n't get caught , which , no offense , is n't very often . And that ings me to what I wanted to propose to you Who could catch you if I 'm by your side ?
MASTER MIND: You want to team-up ?
TITAN: You got the brains , I got the awn . We could even call ourselves that ` Brain ' and ` Brawn ' . Look at this .
MASTER MIND: What do I think ? Master Mind shakes his head tiredly .
TITAN: I worked hard on this .
MASTER MIND: Oh - gee - I am so sorry !
TITAN: Now , hold on . You 're going a little too far .
MASTER MIND: I wish your mother said that to your father the night of you conception , they would have saved me a whole lot of heartache .
TITAN: Hey , I mean it . Master Mind gets right in his face .
MASTER MIND: Oh , yeah ? What are you gon na do ?
DA VINCI: Master !
MASTER MIND: It !
TITAN: I do n't need you , I do n't need anybody . I have the power to do and take anything I want . And now , I 'm gon na take back everything this city owes me . Beware Metro City , it 's time for Titan to collect . Titan shoots up into the air .
DA VINCI: How 'd the plan go , boss ?
MASTER MIND: I just made myself redundant , old friend . Da Vinci gives Master Mind a whiff .
DA VINCI: It 's not that bad .
SECURITY GUARD: Morning , Tighten .
TITAN: Morning .
SECURITY GUARD: Is there something we can do fo you ?
TITAN: Oh , do n't bother about me . I 'm just here to make a withdrawal .
BANK MANAGER: Say , did he just rob us ?
SECURITY GUARD: Not sure . Sort of looks it , do n't it ?
BANK MANAGER: Yeah .
SECURITY GUARD: Should I , you know , stop him ?
BANK MANAGER: UmmYeah .
BRAD HELMS: `` Absolute power corrupts absolutely . '' When Lord Acton stated that , in a letter to Bishop Mandell Creighton in 1887 , no one thought much about it , but today Metro City is reeling from that very prophecy . Tighten , who many thought of as ou savior , has turned his back on the cause of justice .
PLATO: I do n't understand it . He seemed to have every characteristic we were looking for in a superhero .
MASTER MIND: Well , there 's no use crying about it now , we must take action . I 'm not going to play second fiddle to that crass buffoon . We must destroy Tighten .
PLATO: It wo n't be easy . Uberman had a sense of decency and genuine love for the people . That was his weakness and was easily used against him .
MASTER MIND: Yes , but he possesses the same flaws present in Uberman 's DNA - copper . It 's like Benjamin Franklin always said `` If something works do n't dick with it . ''
TITAN: I can have anything I want . I 'm like a god .
BARTENDER: Buddy , what do you want ? Titan carefully considers this for a moment .
TITAN: What do you want ? That 's the question , is n't it . I mean , what do you want when you can have everything ?
BARTENDER: I meant , what do you want to drink ?
TITAN: Oh .
MASTER MIND: There can be only one maste criminal in this city - and it 's me .
TITAN: Really ? Titan melodramatically throws up his arms .
MASTER MIND: I have a better idea - NOW !
TITAN: You know what ? You 're nothing but a ug . Not even worth my effort .
MASTER MIND: He 's not as dumb as I thought .
PLATO: I guess notFunny , though .
MASTER MIND: What 's funny ?
PLATO: Funny Uberman did n't think of the same thing .
HAL: That 's it !
VINNIE: Hey , that 's my ball !
ELDERLY WOMAN: That was a close one . Sixth floor , please . Roxanne smiles and goes to press the button .
MASTER MIND: Wow , I always thought Uberman was your first superhero - but it looks like our little Roxanne dated a linebacker in college .
ROXANNE: That 's my diary .
MASTER MIND: So it is .
ROXANNE: It 's personal .
MASTER MIND: Well , then I would n't leave it in your underwear drawer for just anyone to find . He throws the diary over his shoulder .
ROXANNE: What do you want ?
MASTER MIND: I need your help .
ROXANNE: So you knock me out and tie me to a chair ?
MASTER MIND: You 're not going to like what I 'm about to tell you .
BRAD HELMS: It 's chaos here in city square as city police -
ROXANNE: He 's really out of control .
MASTER MIND: Tell me about it .
ROXANNE: I should have known . You have something to do with this , do n't you ? - With Titan turning evil .
MASTER MIND: Well , the evil thing he did by himself . My goal was to give MYSELF purpose by creating an intellectual sparring partner .
ROXANNE: You 're talking like you made him .
MASTER MIND: And they call me Master Mind .
ROXANNE: Let me get this straight . You missed getting your ass kicked , so you made a new guy to kick you ass . That 's pathetic .
MASTER MIND: In hindsight
ROXANNE: And his powers , they 're just like Uberman 's . Why would he have his powers ?
MASTER MIND: I had some left over from something . I infused him with it .
ROXANNE: YOU DID WHAT ! ?
MASTER MIND: Yeah , that 's why I decided to tie you up .
ROXANNE: You did all this because you wanted purpose ?
MASTER MIND: He seemed nice .
TITAN: Closer . I want to show the people my real face .
ROXANNE: Hal Stewart . He 's the guy we thought saved that woman and kid . Turned out he was just trying to save his own ass .
MASTER MIND: Yeah , good to know - NOW !
TITAN: That 's right , I 'm really Hal Stewart . Former hero and bowling teacher at Kingpin 's Bowling .
ROXANNE: You picked a bowler to give supe powers to ?
MASTER MIND: It 's a modest profession !
TITAN: With my new found power , I 've ecently started to wonder what sort of legacy I should leave . Should I be a hero ? I tried that once before - even saved a lady and her baby from being squashed . I was treated like a god until everyone started to shit on me - Okay , so what if I did n't `` purposely '' save them !
ROXANNE: My god , he 's nuts . That 'll destroy the whole business triangle .
MASTER MIND: My lair is in the direct path of the ball .
ROXANNE: Oh , real nice . Would n't want anything to happen to your hideout , would we ?
MASTER MIND: You do n't understand . I have certain equipment that 's - that 's highly unstable .
ROXANNE: What do you mean ?
MASTER MIND: I sort of have a hydrogen reactor , okay ?
ROXANNE: A HYDROGEN reactor ?
MASTER MIND: It 's experimental - only one in the worldWell , how do you think I power all my inventions ? Someone like me ca n't pay for electricity . The bills would be outrageous .
ROXANNE: A REACTOR ?
MASTER MIND: It creates 100 times the output of a nuclear oneIf destroyed it could
ROXANNE: - Vaporize the entire city !
MASTER MIND: Pshawthe whole eastern seaboard , actually . That little baby is amazing . I 'm quite proud of it .
MASTER MIND: Did Uberman have a hideout ?
ROXANNE: What ?
MASTER MIND: A cave , a solitary fortress of some kind . C'mon , all heros have a place to hang their capes up in . Roxanne , it may be our only chance to find something , a clue , anything that could give us a fighting chance .
ROXANNE: It 's under his house .
MASTER MIND: Whose house ?
ROXANNE: Wayne Scott 's . Master Mind shoots up out of his chair .
MASTER MIND: Wayne Scott ? Uberman was Wayne Scott ! ? Wayne Scott , the wealthy philanthropist ? But he disappeared -
ROXANNE: He disappeared just over two months ago when you killed him . Not only did you rid the world of a hero , you killed a kind , noble , generous man .
MASTER MIND: `` Metro City doomed . '' You know , I never thought I 'd say something like this , but here it goes - He slowly turns to her , CUE HEROIC MUSIC .
MASTER MIND: Ahhhhhh ! Wayne Scott is just as startled .
WAYNE SCOTT: Jesus ! He drop his drink and snack to the floor .
MASTER MIND: I might just ask you the same question . I had thought I incinerated you .
WAYNE SCOTT: You scared the bejesus out of me . How 'd you figure out I was still alive ? Wait , how do you know my identity ! ?
MASTER MIND: Roxanne told me . As for your ruse , I forgot to line the bottom of the copper cage - Somebody pointed that out to me recently . Figured if they could do it , so could you . But one thing I could n't figure out -
WAYNE SCOTT: The skeleton ? Something I `` borrowed '' from a medical school a few months before .
MASTER MIND: A few months ? How long had you been planning this ?
WAYNE SCOTT: I always planned to retire - eventually . I mean , come on , you ca n't do this sort of thing in you fifties . You 'd just look idiculous .
MASTER MIND: I see it all so clearly now .
WAYNE: Man , you ARE smart .
MASTER MIND: But why fake your death ? Why go through all of it ? You could have just quit .
WAYNE SCOTT: But the responsibility would still e there .
MASTER MIND: And Wayne Scott ? Why did he have to disappear ?
WAYNE SCOTT: Both of my lives have so much aggage . It 's time for new baggage , you know ? Master Mind 's is absolutely flabbergasted .
MASTER MIND: I just ca n't believe it . This whole time you 've been in hiding while a force of great evil is tearing you city apart ?
WAYNE SCOTT: I do n't want to hear about it . That 's why I do n't have a television in here to remind me of all the things I SHOULD be doing . Hell , I could get a wife to do that .
MASTER MIND: There 's a demented supervillain out there about to destroy our - I mean , your city . Wayne shrugs indifferently .
WAYNE SCOTT: Good and evil have a way of alancing themselves out . If this guy is as bad as you say , somebody will rise up to fight him . It 's just the order of things . You found me , did n't you ?
MASTER MIND: You 're the only one who can stop him . Wayne turns around .
WAYNE SCOTT: Could n't if I wanted to . Got ta a plane to catch .
MASTER MIND: A plane ?
WAYNE SCOTT: Going to Barbados for a little change in climate . Now , if you 'll excuse me , I got to go pack .
MASTER MIND: Not smart enough to come up with a full-proof trap .
WAYNE SCOTT: Well , you did almost have me when you figured out my weakness was copper . Now that made me sweat a little . Took me way too long to drill out from under that cage .
MASTER MIND: I got lucky .
WAYNE SCOTT: Anyway , it 's a good thing for my sake that I could always count on you for an out .
MASTER MIND: What do you mean ?
WAYNE SCOTT: C'mon , we always threw each other a couple of bones . You would always leave me an out in one of you ` full-proof ' traps , and I 'd neve had you incarcerated at a penitentiary that you could n't eventually escape from . It kept ou little game going . Master Mind seems deflated .
MASTER MIND: Game ? - Was that all this ever was to you ? You know , I was trying my est every time I fought you . Those ` outs ' as you call them were unintentional .
WAYNE SCOTT: Oh .
MASTER MIND: I guess I was never really a match for you , was I ? Wayne shrugs .
WAYNE SCOTT: I think we both got what we wanted out of our relationship . She got a career out of me , and I got plenty of other things out of her . But I 'm eady to move on to greene pastures .
MASTER MIND: I guess I was n't the villain I thought I was , and youyou were n't the hero I thought you were .
WAYNE SCOTT: Roxanne ! How long have you been
ROXANNE: Long enough . Roxanne looks at Master Mind .
TITAN: Alright , I want this whole thing to look ESPN professional , understand ?
TANK LOUDSPEAKER: Titan , we have orders from the city of Metro to take you into custody . If you do not give your self up willingly , we will be forced to open fire . There 's a long pause as no one says anything .
TITAN: Miss me ?
BRAD HELMS: Huh ?
TITAN: You 're kidding me . I give you my sexiest moves and you mean to tell me it was for nothing ?
BRAD HELMS: We were afraid something might hit us .
TITAN: Looks like I 've given the story of the century to the wrong man .
BRAD HELMS: Roxanne . You want Roxanne . She 's a much better reporter than I am . You want her .
TITAN: Where can I find her .
FRANK: We 're actually not supposed to give out that sort of information .
BRAD HELMS: 1314 Mockingbird Lane . I believe she lives in a penthouse .
TITAN: You 've been very helpful .
MASTER MIND: Hurry , we must be on our way as soon as possible .
DA VINCI: Master , why must we flee ?
MASTER MIND: I told you , Titan is too powerful . If he 's set on destroying us , there 's precious little we could do about it .
DA VINCI: Where are we going ?
MASTER MIND: To another city , someplace with a shitload of superheroes to fight . We 'll start over , we 'll go back to doing what we do best .
PLATO: With our tails between our legs ?
MASTER MIND: Plato , do you have a better plan ? !
ROXANNE: What are you going to do about Tighten ?
MASTER MIND: Right now I 'm packing , later I 'll have a snack on the train .
ROXANNE: You 're running away ?
MASTER MIND: In a word - yes .
ROXANNE: You created this monster
MASTER MIND: I did n't create this - the god 's of irony did and I am eating the crow I so richly deserve .
ROXANNE: There 's no time for self pity .
MASTER MIND: I 'll make the time . Roxanne ca n't believe what she 's hearing .
ROXANNE: I 'm not going anywhere .
MASTER MIND: Will you listen to me , no one can stop him .
ROXANNE: You have to try . The city needs your help .
MASTER MIND: I 'm afraid you have an inflated opinion of me .
ROXANNE: What the hell 's happened to you ? The Master Mind I knew would neve have run from a fight even though he knew deep in his heart that he did n't have a chance in hell of winning it . It was your best quality . You need to be that man ight nowI
MASTER MIND: What ?
ROXANNE: I believe in you .
MASTER MIND: Sweet words , but that man is dead . Please , Roxanne , just come with me .
ROXANNE: NoI guess you are a coward afte all . Suddenly , there 's a loud crash .
TITAN: Man , have I got a story for you .
MASTER MIND: Roxanne ? Roxanne ?
TITAN: What pose would be best ? The corny folded arms thing ?
FRANK: Should n't we be making a run for it ight about now ?
ROXANNE: The guy can outrun bullets . I do n't think either one of us is in that kind of shape .
TITAN: She 's right , Frank .
MASTER MIND: Dad , it 's me Bubsy . I know we have n't talked in a while , and I 'm sorry . It 's een a little crazy trying to live up to a legacy .
REPORTER: We interrupt your regular afternoon programming to show you live footage of a potential dangerous situation in downtown Metro . The former hero knows as Titan is placing what appears to be a giant all
DA VINCI: Sir , I think you should see this !
ROXANNE: I 'm here with the cause of the destruction in Metro City . He has kidnapped me and a cameraman to chronicle what he refers to as the creation of a monument to his invincibility and overall `` Asskickiness . '' He will use this giant concrete bowling ball to play the largest game of bowling eve using the buildings of downtown Metro City as his pins . Titan suddenly steps into the shot .
TITAN: And I 'm going for the biggest strike ever . He leans into the camera .
ROXANNE: Annals .
TITAN: What ?
ROXANNE: Nevermind .
TITAN: Like Tiger before him , a young savior has come to raise a sport from the ashes . Rookie Hal Stewart , a young man with a dream , realizing that dream here today , folks .
ROXANNE: Hal , I know everyone treated you like shit , but you do n't have to do this .
TITAN: You 're right . I do n't HAVE to do anything . Is n't that cool ? Titan lines up his shot .
FRANK: Look , what 's that flying in the air ?
MASTER MIND: C'mon , slow down
MASTER MIND: Bowling ? What other trailer park sports can you play ?
TITAN: You are becoming a real pain in my ass . I should have done this a long time ago .
TITAN: What the hell ?
TITAN: If you do n't mind , I 'm going to punch trough your face now .
MASTER MIND: I 'm alive . He turns to see UBERMAN standing next to him .
BYSTANDER 1: It 's Uberman !
BYSTANDER 2: Uberman 's alive !
BYSTANDER 3: We 're saved !
MASTER MIND: I thought .
UBERMAN: So did I . He puts a hand on Master Mind 's shoulder .
MASTER MIND: For what ?
UBERMAN: Showing me the error of my ways , Showing me I 'm meant to be this city 's savior , showing me that , while we can try , there is no unning away from our true destiny .
TITAN: OhDid I interrupt something ?
MASTER MIND: WAIT ! ! !
TITAN: What ?
MASTER MIND: Quick joke - What 's the capital of Thailand ?
TITAN: Huh - I do n't know .
MASTER MIND: It 's bang cock !
ROXANNE: Pretty strange , huh ?
MASTER MIND: They 're cheering for me .
ROXANNE: You saved them . You saved everybody . How 's it feel ?
MASTER MIND: It 's ait 's nice , you know ? I usually do n't get a lot of feedback . But I also kind of caused all this . What happens when they find that out I was the cause of some of this ?
ROXANNE: What they do n't know wo n't hurt them .
MASTER MIND: I guess that is all in the past .
ROXANNE: You 're the hero .
MASTER MIND: I do n't think I 'd go that farI mean I juster
ROXANNE: Master Mind ?
MASTER MIND: Yes ?
ROXANNE: Stop talking . She kisses him . The crowd erupts in a cheer .
SAMANTHA SUMMERS: Who 's bad ? Well , not Master Mind . It seems the former villain has done a career 180 after defeating Tighten and saving Metro City from certain enslavement . And here he is getting a full pardon by Metro City 's Mayor , Steve Dent .
MAYOR: Ahhh !
MASTER MIND: Sorry - Metal hand . Force of habit . He elbows the mayor .
BRAD HELMS: And what about Tighten ? Is there a prison in existence that can hold this super powered menace ? Well , the answer we found is no .
PRISON SCIENTIST: Of course normally he could break out of there anytime , but as you can see we 've taken some special precautions .
BRAD HELMS: What is a Hero ? It seems never has that question needed to be asked more than it does tonight . We go to our very own Roxanne Ritchi , making her triumphant return to our news desk for the answer .
ROXANNE: What is a hero ? Well , there are many different kinds . There are those who hear a call , like the policeman or doctor , then there 's the kind the public creates in their search for meaning and hope . Then , there are those who have the courage to change .
THUG #1: Hey , gim me that purse ?
THUG #2: It 's Master Mind ! Thug # 1 draws a knife .
THUG #1: So ? It 's not like he has any superpowers .

THUG #1: Four against one . For a Maste Mind , you 're really bad at math .

LEONARD: I 'd just become an investigator when I came across Sammy . Mr Samuel R. Jankis - strangest case ever . Guy 's 58 , semi- etired accountant . He and his wife had een in this car accident nothing too serious , but he 's acting funny - he ca n't get a handle on what 's going on .
MRS JANKIS: Gentle . *
LEONARD: His wife has to do everything . Sammy can only do simple stuff . He could n't pick up any new skills at all , and that 's how I got him .

LEONARD: It 's my condition . I never know if I 've already eaten , so I always just eat small amounts .
TEDDY: You do n't have to remember to be hungry .
LEONARD: It 's weird , but if you do n't eat for a while then your body stops being hungry . You get sort of shaky but you do n't ealize you have n't eaten . Have I told you about Sammy Jankis ?
TEDDY: Yeah , yeah . I heard enough about him . Tell me about John G. You still think he 's here , right ?
LEONARD: Who ?
TEDDY: The guy you 're looking for , Johnny G. That 's why you have n't left . Am I right ?
LEONARD: Why ?
TEDDY: Well , the other day you made it sound like you thought somebody might be trying to set you up . Get you to kill the wrong guy .
LEONARD: Yeah , well I go on facts , not ecommendations , okay ?
TEDDY: Lenny , you ca n't trust a man 's life to your little notes and pictures .
LEONARD: Why ?
CONTINUED: 30 .
TEDDY: Because you 're relying on them alone . You Do n't remember what you 've discovered o how . Your notes might be unreliable .
LEONARD: Memory 's unreliable . Teddy snorts . LEONARD No , really . Memory 's not perfect . It 's not even that good . Ask the police , eyewitness testimony is unreliable . The cops do n't catch a killer by sitting around remembering stuff . They collect facts , make notes , draw conclusions . Facts , not memories that 's how you investigate . I know , it 's what I used to do . Memory can change the shape of a room or the color of a car . It 's an interpretation , not a record . Memories can be changed or distorted and they 're irrelevant if you have the facts .
TEDDY: You really want to find this guy ?
LEONARD: He took away the woman I love and he took away my memory . He destroyed everything ; my life and my ability to live .
TEDDY: You 're living .
LEONARD: Just for revenge . That 's what keeps me going . It 's all I have . Teddy considers this .

BURT: Hi , Leonard .
LEONARD: So Sammy ca n't learn any new skills . But I find something in my research Conditioning . Sammy should still be able to learn through repetition . It 's how you learn stuff like riding a bike , things you do n't think about , you just get better through practice . Call it muscle memory , whatever , but it 's a completely different part of the brain from the short-term memory . So I have the doctors test Sammy 's response to conditioning
DOCTOR: Just pick up any three objects .
SAMMY: That 's a test ? Where were you guys when I did my CPA ?
DOCTOR: It 's a test , Sammy .
LEONARD: They kept repeating the test , always with the same objects electrified . The point was to see if he could learn to avoid the electrified objects . Not by memory , but by instinct .

PERP: You do n't understand . Your world is gon na end .
EDWARDS: What are you ? ! The Perp looks down . He decides . and he falls , SCREAMING , to his death .
INSPECTOR: Perpetrator then blinked two sets of eyelids . You mean blinked with both eyes ?
EDWARDS: No , sir . He blinked once with one set , then again with another completely different set .
SERGEANT: Sort of a low beam , high beam .
INSPECTOR: Was that before or after he drew the weapon which you claim evaporated into a million pieces ?
EDWARDS: After , sir .
INSPECTOR: And why do you suppose none of the othe officers saw either of these two events ?
EDWARDS: 'Cause some of the other officers are a little soggy in the midsection . And they could n't keep up , sir .
SERGEANT: Hey , Edwards , if you were half the man I am
EDWARDS: What do you mean ? I am half the man you are .
SERGEANT: What the hell is your problem ?
EDWARDS: My problem is you being all up in my damn face all the time .
SERGEANT: I think he threw him off the roof . Ten minutes your best shot .
INSPECTOR: Sergeant . I want to talk to you outside . Now .
EDWARDS: You need ten minutes on a Stairmaster , you pudgy bastard .

EDWARDS: Oh , yeah , some night . He crosses to the door .
KAY: They were gills . Edwards stops .
EDWARDS: Who are you ?
KAY: Did he say anything to you ?
EDWARDS: Yeah , sure . He said the world was coming to an end .
KAY: Did he say when ?
EDWARDS: You 're kidding , right ?
KAY: Would you recognize his weapon if you saw it again ?
EDWARDS: Absolutely .
KAY: Let 's take a ride .
EDWARDS: Wait a minute . I got a ton of paperwork .
KAY: It 's all done .
INSPECTOR: Good work , Edwards .
KAY: You ran that guy down on foot ? That 's tough . That 's double tough .
EDWARDS: So who you with ? Kay says nothing .
KAY: Nothing is what it seems , kid .
EDWARDS: Oh , yeah , my bad '86 Ford LTD. That 's a luxury ride . C'mon , who ya with ? Kay pulls the car to a stop .
KAY: I 'm part of a secret organization that monitors and polices alien activity on earth .
EDWARDS: This is where we 're going ? They get out of the car .
KAY: Really ?
EDWARDS: All right , you think it 's worth shaking him up , fine . I 'll do my thing . Then I want some answers .
KAY: Do your `` thing , '' kid . Edwards goes inside .
JEEBS: Officer Edwards . Oh , hey , geez , how 'd these get here ? I thought I turned 'em in to the proper authorities .
EDWARDS: Way I hear it , Jeebs , you into something a little hotter than some stolen Rolexes .
JEEBS: Sure I 'm a big crack dealer now . I just work here because I love the hours .
EDWARDS: I 'm talking about guns , Jeebs . High-tech stuff .
JEEBS: C'mon , Edwards , whatcha see is what I got .
KAY: The imports , Jeebs . Now .
JEEBS: You know I got outta that business a long time ago , Kay .
KAY: Why do you lie to me ? I hate it when you lie .
JEEBS: Whoa , whoa , Kay , hold on a minute here
KAY: I 'm going to count to three .
EDWARDS: He 'll do it , Jeebs .
KAY: One .
EDWARDS: I 've seen him do it .
KAY: Two .
EDWARDS: Talk to me , Jeebs , he 's crazy when he 's like this .
JEEBS: He 's always crazy . Take a cruise . Get a massage
KAY: Three .
EDWARDS: Put down the gun and put your hands on the counter !
KAY: I warned him .
EDWARDS: Drop the weapon !
KAY: You warned him .
EDWARDS: You are under arrest . You have the right to emain silent .
KAY: Will you relax ?
EDWARDS: Uh , this . This is what I saw . Kay looks at Jeebs , pissed off .
KAY: You sold a carbonizer with implosion capacity to an unlicensed cephlapoid .
JEEBS: He looked all right to me .
KAY: A carbonizer is an assassin 's weapon , Jeebs . Who was the target ?
JEEBS: I do n't know . Kay raises the weapon again , threatening .
KAY: Jeebs !
JEEBS: I do n't know !
KAY: This is all confiscated . All of it . I want you on the next transport off this rock . O I 'll shoot you where it does n't grow back . Jeebs nods , point taken . Kay leaves .
EDWARDS: Yeah . I 'll be by tomorrow for those Rolexes . Shaken , Edwards follows .
KAY: Searching for a handle on the moment here ? A place to file all this .
EDWARDS: See a head does n't do that , it does n't just grow back . What 's going on ?
KAY: Ca n't help you , kid . Only comfort I can offer is that tomorrow , you wo n't remembe a thing .
EDWARDS: Oh , no . This I 'm gon na remember for a long , long time .
KAY: Ever see one of these ?
EDWARDS: Huh ? Kay checks his watch .
KAY: Whoops . Got ta run . Thanks for the egg rolls .
EDWARDS: Where am I ?
KAY: See what I mean about tequila ? You 're a ight young man , James . Just lay off the sauce . I 'll see you tomorrow , nine a.m. sharp .
WAITRESS: Another beer ?
EDWARDS: Coffee . Please .
EDGAR: Figures .
BEATRICE: What is it , Edgar ? !
EDGAR: Get your big butt back in that house !
BEATRICE: What on earth was it ? !
EDGAR: Sugar .
BEATRICE: I 've never seen sugar do that .
EDGAR: Give me sugar .
BEATRICE: Edgar , your skin ! It 's it 's just hanging off your bones !
EDGAR: That better ? Beatrice faints .
GUARD: Help you ?
EDWARDS: Maybe , I 'm not sure , see , I got this card
GUARD: Elevator . Push the `` call '' button .
ZED: You 're late . Sit down .
EDWARDS: Why , uh I 'm sorry , it 's just no one eally asked this , but why , exactly , are we doing this ?
ZED: Son ?
AMBITIOUS RECRUIT: Jake Jensen , West Point , graduate with honors . We 're here because you 're looking for the best of the best of the best , sir ! Edwards tries to stifle a laugh , but ca n't .
ZED: What 's so funny , Edwards ?
EDWARDS: I I do n't know , sir . This guy . `` Best of the best of the best of the best of the `` It just struck me as Humorous . Sir . Short pause . Then Zed continues .
ZED: Okay . Let 's get going .
EDWARDS: Anyone , uhany of you guys know what we 're doing here ?
MARINE: Looking for the best of the best of the best .
EDWARDS: Well , yeah , I know , but And then .. suddenly
ZED: The hell happened ?
EDWARDS: Hesitated , sir .
ZED: May I ask why you felt little Tiffany deserved to die ?
EDWARDS: She was the only one who actually seemed dangerous . At the time .
ZED: And how did you come to that conclusion ?
EDWARDS: Hook-head guy . You explain to me how he can think with a hook for a head . Answer ; it 's not his head . His head is that butt-ugly ean-bag thing over there . 'Cause if you look at the snarling beast-guy , he 's not snarling , he 's sneezing he 's got tissues in his hand . No threat there , and anyhow , the girl 's books were way too advanced fo an eight-year-old 's . And besides , from where I 'm looking , she was the only one who appeared to have a motive . And I do n't appreciate your jumping down my throat about it .
ZED: He 's got a real problem with authority .
KAY: So do I . The guy ran down a cephlapoid , Zed . On foot . Tenacity . That I can use .
ZED: I hope you know what you 're doing .
EDWARDS: You ! Hey , what 's goin ' on ?
KAY: Back in the mid-fifties , the government started a little underfunded agency with the simple and laughable purpose of making contact with a race not of this planet .
ZED: Now , if you 'll look directly at the end of this device .
KAY: Everybody thought the agency was a joke . Except the aliens . They made contact on March 2nd , 1961 , outside New York City .
EDWARDS: You brought the aliens flowers ?
KAY: They were intergalactic refugees with a simple request . Let us use the earth as an apolitical zone for people without a planet . Ever see `` Casablanca ? '' Same thing , no Nazis . We agreed . So we masked all evidence of their landing .
EDWARDS: The 1964 World 's Fair was a coverup ?
KAY: Why else would we hold it in Queens ? Now left . More nonhumans arrive every year . They live among us , in secret .
EDWARDS: I see . Not to change the subject , but when was your last cat-scan ?
KAY: Every six months ; it 's company policy .
EDWARDS: Well , thanks for the very amusing morning , ut I 'm hopin ' you 'll show me where I came in ? 'Cause this is where I go out .
KAY: Yeah , sure , hang on , I wan na grab a coffee while we 're right here .
EDWARDS: Cab drivers ?
KAY: Not as many as you 'd think . Humans , for the most part , do n't have a clue . Do n't want one , either . They 're happy . They think they 've got a pretty good bead on things .
EDWARDS: Why the big secret ? People are smart , they can handle it .
KAY: A person is smart . People are dumb . Everything they 've ever `` known '' has been proven to be wrong . A thousand years ago everybody knew as a fact , that the earth was the center of the universe . Five hundred years ago , they knew it was flat . Fifteen minutes ago , you knew we humans were alone on it . Imagine what you 'll know tomorrow .
EDWARDS: So what 's the catch ?
KAY: What you 'll gain in perspective , you 'll lose in ways you 're too young to comprehend . You give up everything . Sever every human contact . No one will know you exist . Ever .
EDWARDS: Nobody ?
KAY: You 're not even allowed a favorite shirt . There . That 's the speech I never heard . That 's the choice I never got .
EDWARDS: Hold up . You track me down , put me through those stupid-ass tests , now you 're trying to talk me out of it . I do n't get it .
KAY: You got 'til sun-up .
EDWARDS: Is it worth it ?
KAY: You find out , you let me know .
ORKIN MAN: Well , well , well . Movin ' right in , are we ? Think we own the place ? He unfurls a hose from the side of the tank .
EDGAR: `` Pest '' problem ? `` Pest ? ''
ORKIN MAN: Yeah . You got a hell of an infestation . Edgar advances on him , slowly .
EDGAR: You know , I have noticed an infestation here . Everywhere I look , in fact . Nothing ut undeveloped , unevolved , barely conscious pond scum . So convinced of their own superiority as they scurry about thei short , pointless lives .
ORKIN MAN: Well yeah . Do n't you want to get rid of 'em ?
EDGAR: In the worst way .
EDWARDS: One thing you got ta know right now .
KAY: Cool , slick . Now about those skills of yours , The elevator doors
PASSPORT OFFICER: Purpose of trip ?
ARQUILLIAN: Diplomatic mission .
PASSPORT OFFICER: Duration of stay ?
ARQUILLIAN: Lunch .
PASSPORT OFFICER: Carrying any fruits or vegetables ?
KAY: Let 's go . He 's a littlegrouchy . Kay moves him into the central hall .
EDWARDS: What branch of the government do we report to ?
KAY: None . They started asking too many questions .
EDWARDS: So who pays for all this ?
KAY: Oh , we hold a few patents on gadgets we confiscated from our out-of-state visitors . Velcro . Microwave Ovens . Liposuction .
EDWARDS: What 's this ?
KAY: Observation , the heart of our little endeavor .
EDWARDS: I got ta be honest about something .
KAY: It makes no sense ?
EDWARDS: It makes perfect sense . When I was a third grader in Philadelphia , they told me I was crazy 'cause I swore that our teacher was from , like , Venus or something .
KAY: Mrs. Edelson .
ZED: What 's your jacket size , Edwards ?
EDWARDS: Uh forty regular .
ZED: Then let 's put it on .
EDWARDS: Put what on ?
ZED: The last suit you 'll ever wear .
JAY: The difference between you and me ? He slips on the sunglasses .
ZED: Okay , let 's see . Bee , we got the deposed sur-prefect of Sinalee touching down in the forest outside Portland tonight . I 'm pulling you down from Anchorage to do a meet-and-greet . BEE , an agent on one of the monitors , nods .
BEE: Humanoid ?
ZED: You wish . Bring a sponge . What else everybody , we got ta keep Rolling Fish-Goat out of the sewer system , he 's scaring the rats . And Bobo the Squat wants to reveal himself on `` Unsolved Mysteries . '' Bee , make sure he does n't . He turns a page , coming across a red memo .
KAY: Landed alien out of zone . Who is it ?
ZED: Redgick . He 's not cleared to leave Manhattan ut he 's way out of town right now , stuck in traffic on the New Jersey Turnpike . Why do n't you take Jay ? This is a good one fo him to warm up on .
JAY: Yo , wussup with Zed ? `` Go get em , tiger . We 're not hosting an intergalactic kegger ''
KAY: Zed was saving the world before you were orn , son . Show some respect .
JAY: We got the use of unlimited technology from the entire universe and we cruise around in this ? Kay glares at Jay . He 's getting annoyed .
KAY: Seat belt .
JAY: You know , ya 'll got ta learn how to talk to people . You could be a little kinder and gentler . Kay grits his teeth .
KAY: Buckle up , please .
JAY: Now did that hurt ?
KAY: Makin ' fun of my ride
JAY: Yeah ?
KAY: Never push the button , Jay . Jay jerks his hand away .
REDGICK: It 's my wife ! She 's she 's well , look !
KAY: Oh God . How soon ?
JAY: Me ?
KAY: Sure , it 's easy , you just sorta catch .
REDGICK: Are you sure he knows what he 's doing ?
KAY: Yeah , hell , sure , he does this all the time . C'mon , let him work , Redgick , I wan na ask you something .
JAY: Oh God ! I see it I see it I see it !
KAY: Croagg the Midwife 's back on 64th and 8th . You were headed out of town .
REDGICK: Well , we 're , uh meeting someone .
JAY: Oh sweet Jesus Mother of God did you see that ? !
KAY: So ? Who you meeting ?
REDGICK: Well , it 's a ship .
KAY: Really ? I did n't see a departure clearance for today .
REDGICK: You did n't ? Uh , well it was an emergency .
JAY: Guys guys
KAY: Doin ' fine , Ace . What kind of emergency ? What 's the rush to get off the planet all of a sudden ?
JAY: Help ? ! HELP ! Hello ? !
REDGICK: We just do n't like the neighborhood anymore . Some of the new arrivals .
KAY: What new arrivals ? This have anything to do with the crasher from last night ?
JAY: Can you guys do this later ? !
KAY: Congratulations ! It 's a lizard .
JAY: Hey , you know , it is sorta It vomits on him .
KAY: Anything about that seem unusual to you ? Jay just looks at him , very Jack Benny .
JAY: Pick .
KAY: What kind of `` new arrival '' would scare Redgick so bad that he 'd risk a warp jump with a newborn ? Let 's check the hot sheets .
JAY: These are the hot sheets ?
KAY: Best damn investigative reporting on the planet . But hey , go ahead , read the New York Times if you want . They get lucky sometimes .
JAY: You 're actually looking for tips in a supermarket tabloid ?
KAY: Not looking for . Found .
JAY: Why ?
KAY: Part of the routine . Makes it look like we 're sizing up the situation . Gives he time to get the wrong impression .
BEATRICE: Can I help you gentlemen ?
KAY: How do you do , ma'am , I 'm Special Agent Manheim , this is Agent Black , FBI . Had a few questions about your visitor .
BEATRICE: Are you here to make fun of me too ?
KAY: No ma'am . We at the FBI do n't have a sense of humor that we 're aware of . Mind if we come in ?
BEATRICE: Sure . Lemonade ?
JAY: Damn . If he was this ugly before he was an alien
BEATRICE: Sorry ?
KAY: Go on .
BEATRICE: Anyway , when I came to , he was gone .
KAY: Did he say anything ?
BEATRICE: Yes ! He asked for water . Sugar water , if I emember .
KAY: Sugar water .
JAY: Did you taste her lemonade ?
KAY: Ray Bans . Okay , Beatrice . There was no alien , and the flash of light you saw in the sky was n't a UFO . Swamp gas from a weather balloon was trapped in a thermal pocket and refracted the light from Venus
JAY: Whoa ! That thing erases her memory , and you give her a new one ?
KAY: Standard issue neuralyzer .
JAY: And that 's the best you can come up with ?
KAY: On a more personal note , Beatrice , Edga an off with on old girlfriend . Go stay at your mother 's for a few days and get ove it . Decide you 're better off .
JAY: Yeah , and you 're better off 'cause he neve appreciated you anyway . In fact , you kicked him out , and now that he 's gone , you ought to buy some new clothes , maybe hire a decorator or something
KAY: When you 're ready . Please not green . Purple . And then green .
JAY: Wait do n't tell me that was the question on Final Jeopardy last night .
KAY: Zed , we have a bug .
JAY: I 'm gon na jump way past you and just guess that this is bad . Right ?
KAY: Bugs thrive on carnage , Tiger . They consume , infest and destroy . They live off the death and decay of other species .
JAY: So basically you have a racial problem with all insect-based life forms ?
KAY: Listen , kid imagine a giant cockroach five times smarter than Albert Einstein , four times stronger than an ox , nine times meaner than hell , strutting his stuff around Manhattan Island in his brand new Edgar suit . Does that sound like fun ?
JAY: What do we do ?
KAY: With a bug in town ? Watch the morgues .
ROSENBERG: Sorry I 'm late . The cab drivers on this planet are terrible .
ARQUILLIAN: Your majesty , you are in grave danger .
ROSENBERG: Yeah , and they overcharge you every time .
ARQUILLIAN: Sir , a bug landed here . We must get you off the planet .
ROSENBERG: A bug ? He must know why I 'm here .
ARQUILLIAN: We think he does . Is that what I think it is ?
ROSENBERG: No , just some diamonds for your children . Do we have time to eat ? The Arquillian relaxes .
ARQUILLIAN: Sure . I ordered you some pirogi .
COOK: Table six is up ! and turns away , back to the grill .
ARQUILLIAN: To the continued reign of the Arquillian Empire .
ROSENBERG: To the safety of the galaxy .
EDGAR: You 're right about one thing .
COP: What am I supposed to do with the cat ?
INSPECTOR: I do n't know . Send it with the stiff . Let family claim it .
COP: Where do you want contestant number three ?
LAUREL: By the wall , I guess . What 's with the cat ?
COP: Oh , the cat . There 's a problem with the cat . Sign here . Laurel signs his clipboard .
LAUREL: What 's the problem with the cat ?
COP: Your problem .
LAUREL: Are you having a bad day , baby ? Cheer up . His is worse .
KAY: We watch the morgues very carefully . You 've got something unusual ?
LAUREL: I 'd say so triple homicide .
KAY: I 'll have a look at this one . Dr. White , why do n't you and Dr. Weaver check out the other body ?
LAUREL: This way , Doctor .
JAY: I think , uh , we should start at the same place you did .
LAUREL: All right .
JAY: Your cat ?
LAUREL: Guess it is now . Came in with the bodies .
JAY: Thank-you , but is this really the time to uh you know , come on to me ?
LAUREL: Hey , just walking the dog . Feel that ? Where the piloric junction would e ?
JAY: Oh , yes . Exactly .
LAUREL: Now push that aside . Notice anything strange ? Stomach ? Liver ? Lungs ?
JAY: Nope . All fine .
LAUREL: Doctor , they 're all missing .
JAY: Well , of course they are . What I 'm pointing out is that there are no pieces of them left . So they 're intact , wherever they are . That we can be sure of .
LAUREL: Have we met before ? I have the strangest feeling of deja vu .
JAY: You know , I was just going to ask you the same thing .
LAUREL: Okay . You wan na know what I really think ? But do n't tell that guy . He looks like he 's already under enough stress . This body is not really a body , but it 's actually some sort of transport unit fo something else altogether . The question is what ? Jay just looks at her intrigued .
JAY: No , nonot at all .
LAUREL: You know what I like to do sometimes ? When it 's really late ?
JAY: No
KAY: What do you think ?
JAY: Very interesting . Got a real Queen of the Undead thing goin ' on .
KAY: Of the body .
JAY: Great body .
KAY: The dead body ?
JAY: Not a clue .
KAY: All right . Keep her occupied . Try not to sound too dumb .
LAUREL: Dr. White .
KAY: You 're up , Slugger .
LAUREL: Look at this .
JAY: What is that ?
LAUREL: Far freaking out .
BALTIAN: Must to pre prevent contest ? Noto prevent
JAY: It 's all right What are you trying to say ? Struggle ?
LAUREL: War ? The Baltian nods vigorously . That 's it .
BALTIAN: Galaxy on or or Orion 's What is word ? Be ?
JAY: Bed ? Belt ? Orion 's Belt ?
LAUREL: `` Doctor Whatever '' ? You 're not with the Department of Public Health , are you ?
JAY: He 's dead .
KAY: Rosenberg . Damn . Good man .
JAY: You knew him ?
KAY: One of the few I actually liked . Exiled High Prince .
LAUREL: I was right this is an alien life form , and you 're from some government agency who wants to keep it under wraps
JAY: He said `` to prevent war , the galaxy is on Orion 's Belt . ''
LAUREL: This make total sense . How else do you explain New York ? The other night I 'm in a cab , this guy
KAY: He said there 's a galaxy on Orion 's Belt ? That makes no sense .
JAY: That 's what he said . Did n't he ? Right after he Oh , for Christ 's sake , you did the flashy thing already .
LAUREL: Uh , hi , whoever you guys are , I 'm afraid I 'm going to need to see some ID if you 're going to be in the morgue , okay ?
KAY: Sure thing , sweetheart . Here you go .
JAY: Stop that
KAY: Typical day , too much caffeine , get a life .
JAY: that thing probably gives you brain cancer !
KAY: Never hurt her before .
JAY: `` Never hurt her before '' ? ! How many times have you done the flashy thing to this poo woman ? !
KAY: Couple .
JAY: Are n't you worried about , you know , long term damage ?
KAY: Little bit .
JAY: What the hell happened to make you such a callous son of a bitch ?
KAY: I took this job . He heads out . Jay follows .
JAY: Hey , you never flashed me with that thing , did you ?
KAY: Nah .
JAY: Hey , Kay , I really think I should be in charge of the flashy memory thing department .
KAY: Not while I 'm around , Slim .
JAY: Yeah , well you 're a menace with that thing
KAY: We 've got two dead aliens in there , and a deputy medical coroner in need of a new memory .
EDGAR: No . No , NO , NO , NOOOO !
JAY: Does n't anybody believe in sleep around here ?
ZED: The twins keep us on Alpha Centaurian time a 37-hour day . Give it a few months you 'll get used to it . Or you 'll have a psychotic episode .
JAY: That 's what the little guy was talking about , `` To prevent war , the galaxy 's on Orion 's belt ''
ZED: There are no galaxies on Orion 's belt . The elt is just these three stars ; galaxies are huge , made up of billions of stars . You heard wrong .
JAY: You 're attracted to me , are n't you ?
JAY: Pretty lady
KAY: No .
JAY: Well , it 's better to have loved and lost than never to have
KAY: Try it .
ZED: We 've had twelve jumps in the last hour . Redgick was just the beginning .
JAY: What do they know that we do n't know ?
KAY: Why do rats desert the ship ? Go to Lem Sat IV . Put up a forty-field view of Manhattan .
JAY: And we 've got a dead Arquillian prince .
KAY: Message coming in . The communication continues .
JAY: They sound pissed .
ZED: Translate that and step on it ! Meanwhile get down to Rosenberg 's store and see what you can turn up . Kay and Jay walk away .
JAY: I like that .
KAY: Series four de-atomizer .
JAY: You get a series four de-atomizer and I get a `` Noisy Cricket ? ! '' I 'm afraid I 'm going to break it .
EDGAR: That 's my truck !
DRIVER: And make sure you tell them that at the impound .
JAY: Who robs a jewelry store and leaves the jewels ?
KAY: Someone who 's not looking for jewels .
JAY: This guy had a serious crush on his cat .
KAY: Damn it . Kay runs out after Jay .
JAY: Can we drop the cover-up bullshit ? ! There 's an Alien Battle Cruiser that 's gon na blow-up the world if we do n't
KAY: There 's always an Alien Battle Cruisero a Korlian Death Ray , oran intergalactic plague about to wipe out life on this planet , and the only thing that lets people get on with their hopeful little lives is that they do n't know about it .
ZED: Containment may be a moot point , my friend . The exodus continues . It 's like the party 's over and the last one to leave gets stuck with the check .
MIB: DELIVER THE GALAXY .
ZED: Another contestant has entered the ring .
KAY: All right , kid . The Arquillians want the galaxy , whatever the hell that means . We need help . A professional . Someone with years of experience in intergalactic politics . I just hope the little prick has n't skipped town .
EDGAR: Where do you keep your dead ?
VENDOR: I do n't have any dead .
EDGAR: Where ? !
VENDOR: I do n't know , the city morgue !
JAY: Of course that guy 's an alien . That 's got ta e the worst disguise I 've ever seen . A voice answers him , but not the Vendor 's .
KAY: You busy , Frank ?
JAY: The , uhdog owes my friend some money .
KAY: Arquillians and bugs . What do you know ?
JAY: Ask him about the belt .
KAY: Rosenberg said something about a galaxy on `` Orion 's belt . '' What 's he talking about , Frank ?
JAY: They 're rehearsing a ventriloquist act .
KAY: Here ?
JAY: The galaxy is hundreds of millions of stars and planets ? How 's it here ? If a dog can smirk , Frank does .
KAY: How small ?
JAY: Kay
LAUREL: Boy , when you want attention
JAY: So two galaxies have been fighting fo years . And the only people who 've been enefiting are a race of creatures called ugs . Then the two galaxies decide to make peaceand the bugs send this guy down to make sure the fighting never stops .
KAY: By killing the emissaries , and stealing the galaxy they 've been fighting about .
JAY: And if we do n't get it back before he leaves the planetwe 're history .
KAY: We 're not even history . 'Cause history implies there 's someone around to remembe it .
TONY: Thank you for making sure the bell works .
EDGAR: A man came in here earlier . A dead man .
TONY: And this means what to me ?
EDGAR: He was a very dear friend of mine . And I elieve he had an animal with him . A gift I gave him , a pet cat that means worlds to me . I would like it back .
TONY: I 'll need a picture ID , written proof of ownership of the cat , or notarized proof of kinship with
EDGAR: Do n't do that . WHACK ! Still another fly goes down .
TONY: Do what ?
JAY: I 'll handle this one , you wait outside .
KAY: What the hell for ?
JAY: Because all we have to do is walk in and get a cat , it 's not that hard . But if you go in , you 're gon na lay your Jack Webb on her and flash your brain ray in her face and she 's gon na end up with leukemia o some shit . The woman 's a doctor , she does n't need you erasing half her med school classes . Take me five minutes .
KAY: Two minutes !
EDGAR: Where is the animal ? !
LAUREL: I told you , I do n't know , it ran under some equipment ! Over there .
EDGAR: Get it !

JAY: What races ?
LAMA: It is what you call the future .
ATTENDANT: Ah , the future . An illusion of the time-bound , borne of the fallacy that one moment follows another .
LAMA: Yaz suffers from this greatly . And so he must have revenge on you planet .
JAY: Revenge ? , For what ?
LAMA: He mourns the past because he can not see the dead are still as alive as they ever were . Just not now .
JAY: Okay , someday you 're gon na explain that to me , but right now you need to stop the riddles because there 's about two minutes until Yaz crawls out of his hole and gets back to trying to kill you . So help me out . I need to know IN ENGLISH why Yaz is trying to kill you and what that has to do with saving the Earth .
ATTENDANT: We know what he will know .

KAY: But they 're in danger . One of the most dangerous beings in the universe is out to kill them And if that happens , we 're all going with them , because they 're our only hope of survival .

GUS LACEY: Wandering . Roaming . Yeah .
BOB: So what have you seen lately ?
GUS LACEY: Lately I 've been watching the Loch Ness Monster in Scotland , England - which it turns out is the ghost of a dinosaur . That 's an exclusive for you .
BOB: Okay . Wow .
GUS LACEY: It started when I was a kid . I used to lie on my bed and RV my cousin , Irene , undressing at night . Then , when I was in the army I joined Bill Django 's unit . He trained me and the rest , as they say
BOB: Right . I do n't know who that is . Gus gives a dreamy smile .
GUS LACEY: I ca n't really talk about Bill .
BOB: So what did you do in the army ?
GUS LACEY: We were Psychic Spies mainly . That was our initial tasking butonce they realized what they were sitting on , the forces at work He stops , his face darkening .
BEAT: You mean , whatwith your ?
GUS LACEY: With our minds . That is correct . Just by staring at them .
BEAT: Huh . What kind of animals ?
GUS LACEY: One of our unit stopped the heart of a goat .
BOB: Wow . I do n't know what to say .
GUS LACEY: The power they unlocked in us Last week I killed my hamster . You wan na see ?
BOB: Well , I 've never owned a hamste Gus , so I do n't know what
GUS LACEY: Look at the way it 's glaring at its wheel . Usually that hamste loves its wheel .
BOB: Maybe some of the readers have hamsters so
GUS LACEY: Good . Then they 'll know how rare that is .
BOB: Yeah , I guess any hamster-owning eaders will know what 's aberrant behavior and , uh , what'sOh , shit , he 's down ! ON TV one of the hamsters has fallen over .
GUS LACEY: Yeah , he 's down . At this point I 'd een staring at him for about three hours . The other hamster falls over .
BOB: Oh my God ! You 've dropped both hamsters !
GUS LACEY: No , the other one 's just fallen over .
TV: Bizarre . Right ?
BOB: Wellit did n't die . I thought you said you killed it ?
SHEEPISH: Yeah well Mother said no . She said you might be a bleeding-heart liberal . She said `` Do n't show him the hamster dying . Show him the tape where the hamster acts izarre instead . ''
BOB: Who 's the Skipper ?
GUS LACEY: Lyn Cassady . After Bill he was the most psi-gifted guy I ever met . He was like an Occultic force . I think he runs a dance studio now .
BOB: Do youdo you know a Gus Lacey ? Beat . Lyn gets up and walks away .
LYN CASSADY: You working for Hooper ?
BOB: Hooper ? No . I work for the Ann Arbor Daily Telegram .
LYN CASSADY: How do you know about Lacey ?
BOB: I interviewed him a few years ago . He 'd been appearing on this radio talk show .
LYN CASSADY: Little prickwhat 'd he tell you ?
BOB: He said he joined Bill Django 's unit in the army and was trained to , to , uh remote view ?
LYN CASSADY: ( shaking his head in
DISGUST: Did he show you his `` Home Study Course '' ?
BOB: Yes .
LYN CASSADY: ( walking off down the
CORRIDOR: Yeah I bet he did .
BOB: Are you ? Do you mean you corroborate his , uh ? Because , see , I thought he was just an idiot ?
RUEFULLY: He is an idiotor he washe 's dead now . He was a paranormal whore . Always trying to get into the spotlight , yak , yak yaking . We took an oath . We do n't divulge
BOB: But you 're saying there was a secret unit ? Lyn stops , turns and stares at him .
LYN CASSADY: Wedon'tdivulge .
BEAT: Uh ?
LYN CASSADY: You were in there for hours . What color were the chairs ?
BOB: Umbrown ?
LYN CASSADY: They were green . How many lights are there in this room ? Bob starts to look around .
BOB: A Super Soldier ?
LYN CASSADY: A Jedi Warrior . He would know where all the lights were . He could walk through a room and tell you how many power outlets there were . People are walking around with their eyes closed . At Level One we were trained to instantly absorb all details .
BEAT: What 's a Jedi Warrior ?
LYN CASSADY: You 're looking at one .
BOB: You 're a Jedi Warrior ?
LYN CASSADY: That 's correct .
BOB: What does that ? I do n't think
PATIENTLY: I 'm Sergeant First Class Lyn Cassady , Special Forces , retired . In the eighties I was trained at Fort Bragg in a secret initiative code-named Project Jedi . The objective of the project was to create Supe Soldiers .
BEAT: You 've got super powers ?
LYN CASSADY: That 's correct .
BOB: Hold on , let melet me just
LYN CASSADY: We prefer the term Remote Viewer .
BOB: How does that work ?
LYN CASSADY: Different Jedi had different techniques . Mel Landau used to visualize packing all his cares and worries in a little suitcase , to clear his mind . Steve Cuttle used to read Bible verse
BOB: What about you ? Lyn thinks about it .
LYN CASSADY: Well , I find drinking helps . Also if I 'm listening to classic rock music .
BOB: Yeah ? Like who ?
LYN CASSADY: I like Boston . Boston usually works . Bob jots this down in the notebook .
WRITING: What other powers did you practise ?
LYN CASSADY: Invisibility .
BOB: Invisibility ?
LYN CASSADY: Yup . That was Level Three .
BOB: Actual invisibility ?
LYN CASSADY: Wellyeah , that was the goal . But after a while we adapted it to just finding a way of not being seen . When you understand the , the linkage between observation and eality , you learn to dance with invisibility . Bob tries to follow this .
BOB: Like camouflage ?
LYN CASSADY: It 's not like camouflage . We also practised Phasing . Crossing from particle to wave , from the physical realm to the plane of energy . Solid objects seem to pass ight through you . It 's starts with a breathing exercise Lyn makes a weird shallow PANTING SOUND .
BOB: I don'tcan I be honest , Lyn ? I do n't know what to make of this . I do n't know what to say . This is amazing stuff . How would youI wannacould I write a story about this ?
LYN CASSADY: Not going to happen .
BOB: No , but see , I 've been looking fo a story Lyn . I was going to write about the re-build contracts ut thisthis is even better and
LYN CASSADY: Not going to happen .
BOB: All I 'm saying is we could talk some more tomorrow and
LYN CASSADY: I 'm shipping out tomorrow .
BOB: You 're going home ?
LYN CASSADY: Going to Iraq . There 's this factory we might be partnering with in Al Qaim . Bob 's face falls .
BOB: Oh .
SUDDENLY: I could come .
BEAT: What ?
BOB: I could come with you , maybe , and
LYN CASSADY: Bob , I do n't want to be a story , okay ? I do n't need the attention and
BOB: No , listen , we could change names , stuff could stay off record and
LYN CASSADY: It 's a war over there Bob . Okay ? A war . I ca n't be looking out fo you . Bob flushes with annoyance .
BOB: Well you know , you do n't I look after myself . Okay ? I look afterAnd I 've been in some pretty hairy situations efore . I 'm not , you knowI 'm a journalist , Lyn . You understand ? He slaps his notebook for emphasis .
LYN CASSADY: What 's this ?
BOB: What ? Nothing . I was just doodling .
BEAT: Nothing .
READING: The U.S Army does n't really have any serious alternative than to be Wonderful !
LYN CASSADY: You wanted to know who Bill Django was ? He 's the man who wrote that book .
READING: The New Earth Army is a banne under which the forces of good can gather . The courage and nobility of the Warrior , blended with the spirituality of the Monk .
BOB: The Jedi Warrior will follow in the footsteps of the great Imagineers of the past - Jesus Christ , Lao Tse Tung , Walt Disney
READING: The role of The New Earth Army is to RESOLVE CONFLICT world-wide . Jedis will parachute into wa zones , utilizing sparkly eyes technique , carrying symbolic flowers and animals , playing indigenous music and words of peace
LYN CASSADY: You see it ?
BOB: I think so . Lyn ?
LYN CASSADY: Yeah ?
BOB: Who is this Bill Django ? Lyn draws on his cigarette thoughtfully .
LYN CASSADY: I do n't know where to begin .
LYN CASSADY: Bill always said it started fo him when he fell out of a helicopter in Vietnam .
BILL DJANGO: Oh , man
BILL DJANGO: ( trying to free his
HAND: Okay ! Silence . Long pause .
SOLDIER: What ?
BILL DJANGO: What the fu ! Why is n't anyone firing ? His men stare back at him , frightened .
SOFTLY: Their gentleness is thei strength .
BEAT: Does it direct your powers ?
LYN CASSADY: What ?
BOB: The cone . Does it direct you psychic powers or something ?
LYN CASSADY: No .
BOB: What does it do ?
LYN CASSADY: It cooks supper . He examines the stove approvingly .
BOB: Yes . But He stops .
LYN CASSADY: What ?
BOB: Nothing .
LYN CASSADY: Go on - what ?
BOB: Well it 's justit 's hard to elieve the Pentagon paid fo this . I mean , it 's very interesting , but there 's nothing in here that 's actually aboutfighting ?
LYN CASSADY: The New Earth Army was tasked with preventing conflict . We 're a force of peace , not war . Bill realized if you want to change the world , you 've got to start by changing the armies . He was the one that started the research into non- lethals .
BOB: Non-lethals ? Lyn flicks away his cigarette .
LYN CASSADY: Check this out .
LAUGHS: The Predator ? That 's a plastic blob , Lyn . That 's a
LYN CASSADY: You see ? You 're mine now . The Predator is completely iodegradable . It 's friendly to the earth but it can hurt you in a hundred ways .
LYN CASSADY: It has warrior functions . And it looks a bit funny . This is New Earth Army technology .
BOB: Stop it ! Stop hurting me ! Lyn stares at the blob fondly .
LYN CASSADY: I bought it on line . What 's cool about it is that you could see this lying on the ground and you 'd never know it had such lethality .
BOB: No ! ! ! ! !
MUTTERING: Piece ' a shit .
LYN CASSADY: ) I 've got Crohn 's . The steroids help .
BILL DJANGO: I 'd like us to begin this with a mantra . If we could all breathe in and then out , holding a long `` eeeeee . ''
EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE: ee .
BILL DJANGO: We are a Hollow Army , gentlemen . Vietnam has crushed our soul . We are traumatized and melancholic . We are ashamed . That is why I have ought you to this place of Sanctuary . Here we can mend ou wounds and dream our dreams . My dream is of an America that will lead the world to paradise , an America that no longer has an exploitative view of natural esources , that no longer promotes consumption at all costs . I elieve this is America 's destiny .
OFFICIAL: But why did the Soviets begin this type of research ?
BEAT: What attempt ?
SECOND OFFICIAL: So , they 've started psi research ecause they thought we were doing psi research , when in fact we were n't doing psi research ?
SOFTLY: Lyn ?
BOB: Oh God . Oh God .
BOB: I didn'tI thoughtWhat are you doing ?
LYN CASSADY: Salute to the Sun . He finishes and jumps down .
BOB: What are you doing ?
LYN CASSADY: Cloud bursting . Keeps me in shape . Bob stares up at the clouds .
BOB: Really ? Which one ?
BOB: That one ?
LYN CASSADY: No . That one . The big one .
BOB: Is n't that one too far away ? Lyn looks at Bob like he 's crazy .
LYN CASSADY: They 're all far away .
BOB: Jesus Lyn . You had like the whole desert to drive in Lyn rubs his face ruefully .
LYN CASSADY: Yeah . I 'm sorry about that Bob . Must have got a little bi- locational there , you know ? But do n't worry . Someone 'll come along soon .

BOB: Oh , you speak English ? Great . Deep Purple . Right . You guys like Deep Purple ? You like rock or , or
WEARILY: Yeah .
BOB: We 're going to die ! I 'm going to e killed by Al Qaeda !
LYN CASSADY: I do n't think they 're Al Qaeda .
BOB: Oh what the hell do you know ? You do n't know ! You do n't know anything ! And this is all you fault !
LYN CASSADY: Bob , there 's something I have to tell you . When I said I was etired from the unit , that was a lie . I 'm on a mission . DeWitts was just my cover . I 've been eactivated . I could n't tell you because this is a Black Op , utI think you have a part to play . I think that 's why you 're with me . Bob collapses face down on the mattress .
MUFFLED: You 're an idiot . You want to know why I 'm with you ? Because I got drunk . I got drunk and I just wanted to get into Iraq so I could prove to my wife I wasn'tjust once that IAnd now I 'm going to die . She 's right . I 'm such a
LYN CASSADY: Have you heard of Optimum Trajectory before ? Your life is like a river , Bob . If you 're aiming for a goal that is n't your destiny , you will always be swimming against the current . Young Ghandi wants to be a stock-car racer ? Not gon na happen . Little Anne Frank wants to e a High School teacher . Tough titty Anne . That 's not you destiny . But you will go on to move the hearts and minds of millions . Find out what you destiny is and the river will carry you . Now sometimes events in life give an individual clues as to where their Destiny lies .
BOB: How are we gon na stop them ? There 's three of them ! And they 've got guns !
LYN CASSADY: We 're Jedi , Bob . The Jedi do n't fight with guns . We fight with ou minds .
BOB: What do you mean ?
LYN CASSADY: Let 's say we have no choice but to fight with these men . Then we use visual aesthetics to instill psychically in the enemy a disincentive to attack .
BEAT: What do you mean ?
LYN CASSADY: Okay , you lock eyes with one of them , you go into a monotone and you say `` No , I 'm not going to attack you . '' You totally relax your body and your voice . And then you rip out one of his eyeballs .
BOB: We have n't got a pen .
SIGHS: You 're missing the point . Here let me show you something . Stand up . Bob stands up reluctantly .
BOB: OhI do n't want to Lyn .
LYN CASSADY: Choke me . What am I gon na do ? Just here . Choke . Choke .
BOB: I do n't think Ithere 's sharp edges around here
LYN CASSADY: C'mon `` Attack me . '' Bob stares at him , a little annoyed by this .
BOB: What 's with the quotation fingers ? That 's like implying I 'm you knowonly capable of ironic attacking or
LYN CASSADY: Quit jawing , Bob , and choke me .
BEAT: Well , if I choose to choke you , what are you going to do ?
LYN CASSADY: I 'm going to interrupt you thought pattern .
BOB: Sharpedges
LYN CASSADY: You felt fear did n't you ? Before hand ?
BOB: Yes .
LYN CASSADY: Would you say that level of fea was abnormal for you ? Bob thinks about this .
BOB: I do n't know . I was pretty terrified anyway but the fear I felt on the run-up to the choking did seem , you know , unusual .
PLEASED: You know why ? It was n't you . It was me . I was inside your head . Fighting with the Mind .
YOUNGER IRAQI: Okay . We go .
SOFTLY: I 'm sorry I freaked out , Lyn .
LYN CASSADY: That 's okay . You learnt a lesson . `` Whatever you fear most has no power - it is your fear that has power . ''
IMPRESSED: Huh .

BOB: Yes .
LYN CASSADY: That 's one of the signs .
BOB: Do you really think so ?
LYN CASSADY: Do n't you ? Have n't you always eally felt you were different ? Bob considers this .
BOB: Yes . Yes I have .
LYN CASSADY: That 's the way it is for us . We 're the ones who do n't fit in as kids .

SADNESS: They took this beautiful thing we 'd been building and they corrupted it . They destroyed the New Earth Army .
BOB: Who destroyed it ?
LYN CASSADY: I did .
MAJOR HOLTZ: Yoga is not the business of the US Army , ladies . Drumming circles are not the business of the Army . And love and peace is most certainly not the business of the Army . So you girls better start thinking about how you CAN engage in the usiness of the United States Army , which , in case you have forgotten , involves winning fucking wars !
LARRY HOOPER: It 's some scientific research I 've done for possible offensive psi applications sir . I did show the report to Lieutenant Colonel Django , but he did n't seem interested . Holtz snorts angrily .
MUTTERING: I bet he was n't .
LARRY HOOPER: I think I know one sir . Holtz ponders the report , tempted .

LYN CASSADY: There was no way ! What had the goat ever done to me ? It was totally against the way of the Jedi . I was just going to pretend to try so they would say , `` okay - it ca n't be done '' and forget about it . But then , as I sat there , I felt this , this pulse start inside of me andI could n't stop it . He turns to look at Bob , haunted .
SOLEMNLY: The goat is dead . The three men stare at him .
HOARSELY: Goat number four ?
SURPRISED: No . Number five .
BOB: Collateral damage ?
LYN CASSADY: Collateral damage . That was it . I 'd used my powers for evil and it was like I brought a curse upon us all . Like that poem where the guy kills the seagull and they make him wear it round his neck . Every night I 'd dream of that goat in its little bib , it 's mouth opening and closing but nothing coming out
BOB: The silence of the goats .
LYN CASSADY: I finished my tour and I quit . I walked out of the unit and I neve went back .
BOB: The Dim Mak ?
LYN CASSADY: The Dim Mak . The Quivering Palm . The Death Touch . It 's like this legendary , martial arts move . It was forbidden in the New Earth Army . Larry had got it from a mail- order book .
BOB: What does the Death Touch do ?
LYN CASSADY: It kills you Bob . With one touch .
BOB: Jesus .
LYN CASSADY: There 's a story that Wong Wifu , great Chinese martial artist , had a fight with some guy and had him eat when the guy gave him this light tap , and Wong looked at him and the guy just nodded . That was it . He 'd given him the death touch and Wong died .
BOB: Then and there ?
LYN CASSADY: No . Eighteen years later . That 's the weird thing with Dim Mak - you never know when it 's going to take effect .
SUBTITLED: In America if I do not like my cell-phone company I change them . I am in charge . This is consume power .
BOB: Lyn ?
HISSING: Lyn ? Where are you going ?
BOB: Lyn !
CHOKED: Hello Bill . Bill smiles hesitantly .
BILL DJANGO: Hello Lyn .
LYN CASSADY: This is Bob .
BILL DJANGO: Hello Bob . Bob is too amazed to reply .
LARRY HOOPER: This is primarily a Psyops base .
BOB: Psy for psychic ?
CHUCKLING: Psy for psychological , although the irony is n't wasted on me . Radio broadcasts , leaflets , that sort of thing . Bob picks up a LEAFLET .
READING: `` American Soldier - your wives are ack home having sex with Bart Simpson and Bert Reynolds . ''
LARRY HOOPER: Yeah , had n't exactly done thei homework there .
LYN CASSADY: I remote viewed you . Larry smiles a little mockingly .
BOB: If this is Psyops what are you doing here ?
LARRY HOOPER: I said primarily Psyops . This is a estricted area , you understand ? Everything you hear and see stays secret or you go to prison . Bob nods a little nervously .
BOB: `` Sick ? ''
LARRY HOOPER: It 's pronounced psi-ike . Psychic Systems International Corp . Turns out certain people had heard about the New Earth Army and were interested in some of the work we were doing back then . They got in touch with me , I got in touch with Bill .
LYN CASSADY: You 're working for him ? Bill frowns at the CDs , not seeming to hear .
LARRY HOOPER: Bill 's been looking into subliminal messaging . This is one we 've designed to play to our own troops before combat .
BOB: There 's a subliminal message in this ?
LARRY HOOPER: This is '' Do n't get drunk before firing heavy machine guns . '' We 've got all sort of products in development . Tell them one of our new ideas .
PSIC WORKER: Air bag mine ?
LARRY HOOPER: Air bag mine . Non-lethal mine , catapults the fucker up into air . Gim me another one .
LARRY HOOPER: Excellent . Attack Bees . The Forces of Nature ! Another .
BILL DJANGO: Gon na get some ice-cream .
LARRY HOOPER: You get the odd flash of what he used to be but he 's pretty urnt out with the booze .
ANXIOUSLY: What ? What is it ?
LYN CASSADY: It 's the Dark Side .
BOB: What are you going to do ? Lyn stares at the wall .
LYN CASSADY: It 's too lateI 'm dying , Bob .
BOB: Oh , you 're not dying ! I do n't elieve you can kill someone with a mail order Dim Sum . You ca n't
LYN CASSADY: Dim Mak .
BOB: Whatever . I do n't believe you can just
LYN CASSADY: It 's cancer .
BOB: just tap someone and it What ?
LYN CASSADY: I mean , I know it was caused by the Dim Mak . Butit'syou knowit 's cancer . That 's what the doctors say . Different ways of looking atdifferent names for a eality or , or uh
BOB: I think you should go and see Lyn , sir . he needs you . Bill does n't answer .
BEAT: It is n't real .
BOB: What is n't ?
BILL DJANGO: The feather . Twenty thousand dollar fine for taking an eagle feather . This one 's off a turkey . You just die the tip black . Do n't tell Lyn . Bill stares at the feather .
ANGRILY: That is n't true . That is n't true .
LARRY HOOPER: Oh . Did n't mean to wake you . The two men stare at each other .
BEAT: Just tired .
LARRY HOOPER: How 'd you find us ?
LYN CASSADY: I told you . I remote viewed you .
SMILING: Scotty Mercer told you , did n't he ?
LYN CASSADY: No .
LARRY HOOPER: Yeah , he did . We told Scotty we were coming over here , asked him if he wanted some work .
LYN CASSADY: I have n't seen Scotty .
LARRY HOOPER: That 's funny , because he told me he 'd run into you and mentioned that there might be some jobs going with us over here . Is n't that why you came , really , Lyn ? You want back in , do n't you ?
BEAT: Do n't make a decision now . Tell me in the morning . He pats Lyn 's leg , walks out .
BOB: Bill ? Bill are you okay ? Bill opens his eyes suddenly .
BILL DJANGO: I just saw Timothy Leary .
BEAT: Timothy Leary 's dead .
BILL DJANGO: I know . He 's had an idea .
SALUTING: Good evening sir .
MUMBLING: Getting some ice-cream .
SOFTLY: Do n't eat the jello . Lyn turns to Bob puzzled .
BEAT: What ?
BOB: Do n't eat the jello .
LYN CASSADY: What 's going on ?
BOB: We put LSD in the jello . Lyn turns to stare at him .
LYN CASSADY: What ?
BOB: Bill showed me where Larry had ottles of LSD . So we put it in the jello mix last night .
SUDDENLY: And in the water . Bob turns to stare at him .
BOB: What ?
BILL DJANGO: I put it in the main water tank as well .
BOB: Butwe 've drunk the water .
THOUGHTFULLY: Yeah . He pours himself another coffee .
ARMY BROADCASTER: I 'm guessing . I mean , I have n't looked at the , the thing but I 'd say it 's going to be fucking HOT ! Hot . Hot . Hot .
SOLDIER: You 're going to hit the gates . You 're going to hit the gates .
CALMLY: It 's okay . You missed them .
ANGRY: Do n't you think it might have been more sensible if we had n't drunk the fucking water ?
BILL DJANGO: That might have aroused suspicion . But do n't worry . Over the years I have built up a massive tolerance to all narcotics .
SOFTLY: Give me the gun Larry .
LARRY HOOPER: Wow . I 'm hungry . He wanders off .
LAUGHING: Hey ! More music ! Get off , will ya ?
LYN CASSADY: Okay , let 's go .
WAVING: That 's it . Keep going . Ma'assalama . The Iraqis start to hurry away over the sand .
CALLING: Wait ! Wait for me ! Where are you goingwhat about the mission ?
LYN CASSADY: You are the mission Bob ! You are the mission ! Tell them what happened !
CHUCKLING: And finally , US forces in Iraq are using what some are calling a cruel and unusual tool to break the resistance of Iraqi POWs , and many parents would agree ! Some prisoners are being forced to listen to Barney the Purple Dinosaur sing the I Love You song . I think after an hour of that they 'll spill the beans ! Do n't you ? Let 's go outside to Al fo the weather .
BOB'S EDITOR: Bob ?
ROPER: Come on . Stay up there , Cozy Girl
KIMURA: Hi , Roper .
ROPER: Hi , Kimura . Where 's the command post ?
KIMURA: The suspect came in shortly afte the bank opened . Botched robbery . A teller hit the silent alarm . He took seven hostages . Shot one the guard . He 's still alive . So far he 's asked for
ROPER: a car .
KIMURA: That 's right , and a plane waiting at the airport . If he does n't
ROPER: get 'em , he 's going to start shooting hostages in five minutes
KIMURA: That 's right .
ROPER: What 's the suspect 's name ?
KIMURA: Earl .
ROPER: Hello , guys .
BAFFERT: Hello , Roper . Glad you could join us .
ROPER: Do we have a profile on Mr. Earl ? Baffert hands him a folder . Roper opens it .
BAFFERT: This guy is no genius . Roper scans the profile .
ROPER: They 're not usually graduate students .
BAFFERT: SWAT wants to go in .
ROPER: What 's the rush ? They have n't killed anybody yet this week ? Roper refers to the folder .
KIMURA: Well he 's a little fucking agitated he ripped the phone out .
ROPER: I have to go face to face .
BAFFERT: No you ca n't do that .
ROPER: You got 7 hostages in there , 1 of them 's wounded We do n't know how ad it is The guy ripped the phone out SWAT said he 's got a gun to the head of a female hostage . If SWAT makes entry now , you 're gon na lose 1 hostage , maybe 2 . I got ta go in . Maybe I can see what 's going on in there .
BAFFERT: I do n't know .
ROPER: He 's never offed anybody . His rap does n't show any violence .
BAFFERT: Not that we know of .
ROPER: We do n't know how much time we have . If I can get in to talk to him maybe we wo n't lose anyone .
BAFFERT: Maybe we can get a throw phone in there .
KIMURA: SWAT says it 's broken The perp in the last situation rendered it inoperable .
BAFFERT: What do you mean ?
KIMURA: He urinated on it and shorted out the circuits .
ROPER: We gon na stand here and talk about it or let the guy in there bleed to death . Give me a dozen donuts .
FORBES: What do you think he 's got in the ag ?
MCCALL: Donuts .
FORBES: You ca n't take a guy down with a donut .
ROPER: Hi , Earl , I 'm Scott Roper . Wan na donut ? I ate the glazed but there 's a bunch of chocolate and a
EARL: Where 's the car ?
ROPER: I need to get something straight first .
MANAGER: I am . Roper takes a step toward him .
ROPER: When did you start keeping longe hours ?
MANAGER: Last spring .
ROPER: Really ! Because I 've been thinking of moving to this branch . It would e really convenient for me
EARL: HEY , SHUT UP !
ROPER: It 's my job to see that no one gets killed , Earl Including you .
EARL: Then where 's my FUCKING car !
ROPER: I 'm getting it , Earl , but we have to do this the right way .
TELLER: Debbie
ROPER: Point the gun away from Debbie .
EARL: Debbie 's brains are going to be splattered all over the floor if I do n't see a car in five minutes !
ROPER: Alright ! But let 's be clear about one thing . If you kill someone , I ca n't help you . The SWAT guys will take you out .
EARL: What are my chances of getting out of here ?
ROPER: Not bad . Last month , a guy robbed a ank in Daly City
EARL: Really ?
ROPER: Absolutely . Bank robbers are generally your smartest criminals . Roper looks directly into Earl 's eyes .
EARL: Hey , leave him alone . What are you doing ?
ROPER: It 's part of my negotiator 's oath . If there 's an injured party and I can help them , I 'm duty bound by my oath to do that . You can shoot me if you want , but the next negotiator in here is going to tell you the same thing .
JENNINGS: Why not keep the streak alive ?
ROPER: Because this strung-out junkie is too stupid to get out of this without killing somebody .
ROPER: As a rule , I need one hostage released as show of good faith .
EARL: Take the old guy .
ROPER: The Old Guy ? What kind of show of faith is that ? I want Debbie .
EARL: Am I gettin ' the car ?
ROPER: You 're gettin ' the car .
EARL: Take them .
ROPER: You two , leave .
FORBES: This guy is good .
MCCALL: That 's what they say .
ROPER: That was fine , Earl . Now I 'm going to get your car .

EARL: Automatic .
ROPER: You got it .
EARL: I give up ! I give up !
RADIO: The situation is secured . Suspect in custody . Repeat . Situation secured .
RONNIE: There 's one for the front page .
ROPER: Ronnie , why are you torturing me ? I ca n't live without you .
RONNIE: Do n't start .
ROPER: This baseball player you 're going out with He 's no good for you .
RONNIE: Really ? ! He 's a wonderful guy . He makes two million a year , and he worships me .
ROPER: I worship you .
RONNIE: You worship yourself .
ROPER: Ronnie , forget this what's-his-name .
RONNIE: Greg .
ROPER: Did you know he 's already got a bad knee ? In another 10 years you 're going to be pushing him around in a wheelchair . Ronnie stops . Looks him in the eye .
RONNIE: You know what I think ? I think you only want me now , because I 'm with somebody else .
ROPER: Who cares what you think . I want you ack and that 's all that matters . Ronnie smiles , but offers no response .
RONNIE: I 'm going out with Greg tomorrow .
ROPER: This Greg is really getting in my way . Roper gets down on his knees .
RONNIE: Oh , I 've got to get a shot of this .
ROPER: Hey , that 's my car .
REPO MAN: Not anymore . Now it belongs to Silve Hills Financial .
ROPER: Hey , Baffert , what 's the story fo tonight ?
BAFFERT: Floor seats .
ROPER: You 're my hero .
BAFFERT: Dinner 's on you .
ROPER: Deal .
SOLIS: He just walked into my office . The Chief says , `` Good work this morning . Congratulations . '' Roper smiles as he sits down .
ROPER: Tell him to give me a raise .
SOLIS: He says , `` Thank you very much . '' I 'll discuss it with him right now Good-bye , Chief .
ROPER: What ?
SOLIS: Are you going to make this hard fo me ?
ROPER: Depends . What 's up ?
SOLIS: There 's been some concern about you continuing to work without back-up .
ROPER: Define concern . Solis dumps his cards on the table .
SOLIS: What if you die and no one can do what you do as well as you do it ?
ROPER: Your concern is heartwarming .
SOLIS: It 's been decided that you take on another partner and train him to be able to take over for you .
ROPER: Is that what the guy in the Sunday School suit is doing outside ?
SOLIS: His name 's Kevin McCall . Every Metro Captain agrees that he 's their top sharp-shooter and most likely to succeed . Roper grabs McCall 's folder off the desk .
ROPER: Let me see that . Roper scans it .
SOLIS: You let us worry about that .
ROPER: Is there going to be an expression of your appreciation ?
SOLIS: What kind of appreciation are we talking about ?
ROPER: The financial kind . I figure I 'm going to be working extra hours . All sorts of overtime training sessions Not to mention the extra stress
SOLIS: What do you think would be in order ?
ROPER: Like ahh I do n't know Five thousand dollars .
SOLIS: Okay , I think I could swing that . Uh-oh , Roper thinks maybe he sold short .
ROPER: And a car .
SOLIS: Hey , you just got a five thousand dollar raise . Get a car of your own .
ROPER: You know you 've got nothing but cars down there in impound .
SOLIS: Impound is n't a rent-a-car company .
ROPER: The car is part of the deal .
SOLIS: What happened to your Trans Am ?
ROPER: Repoed this morning .
SOLIS: I 'll provide you with transportation .
ROPER: And even if this does n't work , I want all the money . These SWAT guys do n't have the temperament . They do n't have the background McCall enters the office .
MCCALL: Same here . I 've watched you in action . Very impressive .
ROPER: You 've got a lot of hard work ahead of you if you want to be a negotiator .
MCCALL: I 'm ready to do it . And I 'm going to be here more than two weeks . Roper 's face darkens .
ROPER: Do n't go reading my lips , man . That 's an intrusion . Save that shit for the sniper school . Comprende ?
MCCALL: Sorry Habit .
SOLIS: Let 's move past this , gentlemen . Roper smiles .
ROPER: We 're already past it , are n't we , Kevin ?
MCCALL: If you say so .
SOLIS: Then you 'll have to excuse me . I have other work to do . Roper and McCall head out the door .
ROPER: You ever been in a hostage situation ?
MCCALL: Only at the very end .
ROPER: How do you feel after a shooting .
MCCALL: Like it had to be done .
ROPER: It rarely has to be done .
MCCALL: I 've rarely shot anyone .
ROPER: SWAT is a lifesaving unit , you know .
MCCALL: I know .
ROPER: Try to remember that . They arrive at Roper 's desk .
MCCALL: What 's the point of this ?
ROPER: A little exercise in lateral thinking . The obvious solution is n't always the only solution See you tomorrow .
BAFFERT: Mind if we make a stop on the way ? We busted Frank Antonucci on possession . He gave us a lead on that Polk Street jewelry heist .
ROPER: `` Phoney Frank '' ? Do n't waste you time . He 'd tell you his granny was in on the Kennedy assassination if he could dodge a collar .
BAFFERT: I still got ta do it . Wasting time is half my job .
ROPER: Yeah , okay .
BAFFERT: This SWAT guy might be a good idea . He may be able to take a little pressure off you . I worry about you .
ROPER: You worried about me , too ? The chief 's worried about me . Solis is worried about me . Maybe you guys should start some kind of organization .
BAFFERT: Speaking of which . I saw you talking to Ronnie this morning . Why ca n't you get it back together with her . You 've got ta be out of your mind not to get with that one .
ROPER: It 's not me . It 's her . She 's going out with this baseball player Greg Barnett .
BAFFERT: No shit ! He 's good !
ROPER: Fuck him . He swings at anything in the dirt . I could strike him out .
BAFFERT: Do n't give up on her . You 're getting to the age when you ought to be thinking about these things . Roper bends over like an old man .
ROPER: Yep , my rheumatism 's been acting up .
BAFFERT: This is it . Space 742 . Roper looks at the pickup truck in disbelief .
ROPER: Then he did n't say 742 . He must have said 724 or something , because this ca n't be right .
BAFFERT: Where 's the stereo ?
ROPER: Fuck the stereo . What 's that smell ?
BAFFERT: Come on . Just get in . We got ta go .
BAFFERT: Apartment 306 .
ROPER: You want me to go up with you ?
BAFFERT: Nah , It probably wo n't turn up anything . I 'm just gon na talk to him .
ROPER: Good . I do n't want to be late . Baffert gets out . Roper grabs his cell phone .
BAFFERT: What 's the line ?
ROPER: It was Warriors plus 6 this morning .
BAFFERT: I 'll take half of your action .
KORDA: Who is it ?
BAFFERT: May I come in ? I would just like to ask you a couple of questions .
KORDA: Duke Ellington . `` Things Ai n't What They Used To Be '' , recorded July 30 ,
BAFFERT: Yeah Yeah Now I can hear it .
KORDA: Used record shop down on Turk Street . I was in there looking for some Robert Johnson . Memories Memory Lane o something
BAFFERT: I 've got to stop in there Mr. Korda , do you know Frank Antonucci ?
KORDA: You mean Frank who owns the bakery down the street ? Baffert smiles .
BAFFERT: No , this is a different Frank . This is a man who deals in jewelry . Stolen jewelry usually . You would n't know anybody like that ?
KORDA: I certainly would n't .
BAFFERT: Could I please have a little water ?
KORDA: Of course .
BAFFERT: The reason I 'm asking you is because we arrested him with some stolen jewelry . It was traced to the robbery of a store down on Polk Street . He said he was fencing it for you . Baffert notices something in the trash can .
KORDA: There 's obviously some mistake . I have a cousin who has had run-ins with the law .
BAFFERT: This cousin of yours What 's his name ?
KORDA: Clarence Teal .
BAFFERT: Thank you .
KORDA: Lieutenant Baffert turns back around .
BAFFERT: Could be .
ROPER: Get an ambulance !
SOLIS: Yes sir . Every resource will be ought to bear . We will find this guy Yeah , he 's here now . I 'll tell him . Solis hangs up the phone .
ROPER: He said he was just going up to talk to him . He said I want to be put on this case .
SOLIS: I ca n't do that .
ROPER: I want to be put on this case .
SOLIS: You know I ca n't assign you to this . You 're much too close to it . You were much too close to Sam . The department will take care of it .
ROPER: Who 's running it ?
SOLIS: Roper
ROPER: Who 's running it !
SOLIS: Kimura and Glass will head the investigation . Roper turns to leave .
ROPER: Hey , hey , hey Roper intercepts them .
KIMURA: Solis said to keep you clear of this .
ROPER: I do n't give a damn what Solis said . If you get a lead , I want to know .
RONNIE: Hey .
ROPER: Hey yourself . Came by to see Troy .
RONNIE: A little late for that , Scottie . He 's asleep . Jack Daniels ?
ROPER: I 'm not drunk . Yet .
RONNIE: Maybe you should be .
ROPER: You heard .
RONNIE: Yeah . I 'm sorry .
ROPER: Can I come in ? Ronnie opens the door reluctantly .
RONNIE: About 4 months old . I 'm working in a new style .
ROPER: Hey , Troy . How ya doin ' boy ? He heard my voice .
RONNIE: You do n't usually talk to anyone when you 're hurting .
ROPER: It was my fault . I was right downstairs . I should have gone up with him .
RONNIE: Scott , You ca n't save everyone .
ROPER: I 've proved that , did n't I ?
RONNIE: What do you want from me ?
ROPER: Something I guess I ca n't have anymore .
RONNIE: Do n't try to make me feel guilty . The whole time we were together , you went out of your way to prove you did n't need me . Now , suddenly , fo one night , you need me again . I ca n't do it . I ca n't be more than you friend . Because I know what will happen . In a few weeks you 'll be ack on top , and you 'll shut me out just as soon as you do n't need me again .
ROPER: You think I did n't need you ?
RONNIE: If you did , you never showed it .
ROPER: Ronnie
RONNIE: They 're on the table where you always leave them .
GREG: Hey , baby , I thought maybe you were Greg 's smile fades as he sees Roper .
ROPER: I was just leaving .
RONNIE: Scottie take care of yourself . Roper does n't look back . He just goes .
KORDA: If you were n't family I 'd kill you . Clarence is scared . He offers no defense .
CLARENCE: So that we could get the best price . He 's got respect for you . He 's gon na try to lowball me , Mike . Korda tosses Clarence down onto the cot .
KORDA: You fucking idiot ! Why do you think I use you ? To be a walking advertisement .
CLARENCE: I 'm sorry , Mike . I never heard of LaMarra flipping on anyone before . He said he had the cops paid off . Antonucci never flipped on anyone efore . He had the cops paid off .
KORDA: Not the fucking cop that showed up at my door !
CLARENCE: What happened , Mike .
KORDA: You do n't want to know . Tears start to come to Clarence 's eyes .
CLARENCE: I 'm sorry , Mike .
KORDA: God damn it ! I still needed to case that fucking store . It 's too risky to show my face now .
CLARENCE: I got a couple thousand bucks . You could leave town .
KORDA: Leave town ? They 're going to know me in fucking Des Moines now ! They got over ten million in jewels in that place . That 's freedom , man . I could go anywhere I want .
CLARENCE: Did you kill him , Mike ?
KORDA: It 's not your fault you 're stupid . Tears of relief from Clarence .
ROPER: What do you got on Korda ?
KIMURA: We ran a search on relatives . He has a cousin in town Clarence Teal . Smalltime thief . Last known address was on Pine Street . He moved out a month ago . We 've got a couple leads on him to check out .
ROPER: Did you check out DMV for any vehicles egistration ?
KIMURA: Being faxed over now .
ROPER: How about the record room for any incident reports ? He might be a victim . We can get medical records . Check with burglary detail and see if anyone else knows him , knows his habits .
KIMURA: Roper
ROPER: And what about bars ? We can talk to neighbors to see what bars he frequents .
KIMURA: Roper , we 're into it Suddenly Solis appears at their side .
SOLIS: We 've had this conversation once , Roper . You 're not active on this case . Roper looks at him icily .
ROPER: You guys are doing good work .
MCCALL: I 'm sorry about your friend . I had a friend in SWAT killed . I know how it can be .
ROPER: I appreciate your concern . Let 's leave it at that .
SERGEANT: Roper , domestic disturbance at 472 6th Street . Possible hostage situation .
ROPER: So , McCall , how come you ended up in San Francisco ?
MCCALL: They recruited me . Promised me fast advancement .
ROPER: Recruited you from where ?
MCCALL: National Marksman Competition .
ROPER: With your qualifications you must have had a lot of offers . Why here ?
MCCALL: Furthest point I could find from New York .
ROPER: You do n't like New York ?
MCCALL: Spent my whole life there . I just wanted to get out for a while .
ROPER: You 'd never been out of New York ?
MCCALL: Been to Toronto . My mother was born there .
ROPER: How did you like Toronto ?
MCCALL: It was okay .
ROPER: You 're a real excitable sort , are n't you ?
MCCALL: You caught me on an `` up '' day . How about you ? How did you end up in San Francisco ?
ROPER: I grew up in Oakland Crossed the Bay Bridge and here I was . So you 're looking for `` fast advancement '' .
MCCALL: Is there something wrong with that ?
ROPER: I 'm not sure .
OFFICER #1: Husband came home . Found that guy and his wife `` in flagrante '' . Now he 's holding her at knife point .
ROPER: Which apartment ? The Officer points up to the third floor .
OFFICER #1: That one with the bars on the windows .
ROPER: How are we gon na get him out of there ?
MCCALL: We could fill it with water .
ROPER: Have you evacuated anyone ?
OFFICER #1: Only that floor .
ROPER: Is the hostage injured ?
OFFICER #1: Do n't know . She keeps screaming to stay out . He keeps screaming to stay out . We decided to stay out .
ROPER: Well , there 's a good amount of agreement on that .
MCCALL: I 'll take `` highground '' until SWAT gets here . I can get a good sight-line from that roof across the street . McCall marches off across the street .
ROPER: Remember , Quick Draw , we 're trying to limit the force here . McCall calls back over his shoulder .
MCCALL: I know my job .
WIFE: No , Raymond !
RAYMOND: Stay the fuck out of here !
ROPER: I know how you feel , Ray .
RAYMOND: You do n't know shit , and I suggest you leave .
ROPER: I ca n't leave , Ray . It 's part of my negotiator 's oath . Once I 'm in the oom with the hostage , I have to stay .
RAYMOND: You do n't want to see what I 'm going to do to her .
ROPER: Let me show you something , Ray .
RAYMOND: I ai n't interested in your life story .
ROPER: Because I was partially to blame . I was n't around as much as I should have been . I forgot how to love her .
RAYMOND: She 's the one to blame . Not me .
ROPER: Ray , think about how she looked when you married her . Think about how happy you were . Do n't lose that , man . Do n't give up everything .
RAYMOND: What am I giving up ? I 'm laid off last year . I 'm down to my last unemployment check . I 'm out on the streets looking for work and this itch is banging some asshole in my ed .
ROPER: Ray , if you walk out of here with me , I 'll get you a job .
RAYMOND: Doing what ? Cleaning toilets ?
ROPER: I ca n't guarantee you what it will e. But I swear on my life , I 'll find you work .
RAYMOND: And why the fuck would you do that for me ?
ROPER: Not for you , Ray . For me . A close friend of mine was killed this week . The way I figure it , I stop you from doin ' what you said , I 'm one up on ody count .
RAYMOND: Who the fuck are you , Mother Teresa ?
ROPER: My name 's Scott Roper .
RAYMOND: I need my coat .
ROPER: NOOOO ! !
MCCALL: SWAT is a lifesaving unit , remember ? I just saved a life . Yours . Roper does n't miss a beat .
ROPER: You think I 've never had a gun pulled on me ? ! You think every fucking time someone pulls a gun they use it ? ! McCall gets to his feet .
MCCALL: Eighty-five percent of domestic disturbances of this nature end in murder/suicide .
ROPER: Not the ones I 'm at .
MCCALL: Sorry . My mistake .
INVESTIGATOR: Looks like a clean shoot . Go home and get some rest .
ROPER: Come on . Let 's go for a drink .
MCCALL: I do n't really like to drink .
ROPER: You have to . It 's a tradition .
MCCALL: Well , if I have to , I have to .
ROPER: You got a girlfriend ?
MCCALL: Why ? You like my ass ? McCall misses the shot .
ROPER: Better than your pool game . Roper lines up his shot .
MCCALL: I do n't gamble .
ROPER: You living together ?
MCCALL: She 's back in Jersey going to graduate school .
ROPER: Explain how that works .
MCCALL: She 's going to come here when she graduates and then we 're gon na get married .
ROPER: She grow up in Livingtston , too ?
MCCALL: No , no , no She 's from Hoboken .
ROPER: Oh , `` city girl '' . Do n't you ever long for companionship with her such a long way away in New Jersey ?
MCCALL: We see each other every couple of months .
ROPER: Every couple of months , huh ?
MCCALL: Do you really ?
ROPER: No . Actually I think it 's fucking crazy , I do n't know if I could do it .
MCCALL: Thanks for clearing that up . I hear your former girlfriend is going out with Greg Barnett .
ROPER: Where did you hear that ?
MCCALL: Around . Barnett 's tough competition .
ROPER: Yeah , well that 's a sore subject , and therefore out of bounds to a young sprout of a hostage negotiato under my tutelage .
MCCALL: I think I can handle that one .
ROPER: Yeah , you think so , but it comes up .
MCCALL: I think so . Roper nods . Maybe he can .
BAD GUY: What the fuck do you think is going on , turdhead ? I 'm about to waste everyone in this place .
MCCALL: H how can I help you ? Tell me what I feel stupid talking to a dummy .
ROPER: What did you think ? I 'm going to let you practice on real people ? Roper comes up beside him .
MCCALL: No .
ROPER: It 'll come . Try again .
MCCALL: My name 's McCall . I 'm a hostage negotiator . I 'm here to help you . Roper 's voice crackles back at him hostilely .
ROPER: Nah , I just throw that in because I enjoy it .
MCCALL: So what do I say to this guy ?
ROPER: You could say something like , `` Tell me what the scumbag 's name is . Maybe we can work something out . ''
MCCALL: What ? Bring somebody in so he can cut his nuts off ? Roper turns to McCall .
ROPER: If you want to be a successful negotiator , you 've got to learn to lie .
MCCALL: I 'm not good at lying .
ROPER: Get good at it .
MCCALL: It 's against my nature . Roper gives him an amused smile .
ROPER: You know the ten commandments ?
MCCALL: Yes .
ROPER: What 's the first commandment ?
MCCALL: Thou shall have no other God before me . That 's not the answer Roper wanted .
ROPER: Okay , forget that . What 's the main one . McCall is tired of guessing .
MCCALL: You tell me .
ROPER: Thou shall not kill You 've killed , ight ?
MCCALL: Yes .
ROPER: Why ?
MCCALL: To save lives .
ROPER: So why would you hesitate to lie to save lives ?
MCCALL: My name 's McCall . I 'm unarmed .
ROPER: Close your eyes .
MCCALL: A dirtbag behind the counter holding a sawed-off . A Berretta nine millimeter in his belt . A female hostage , red dress , on the floor in front of the cereal display . Male hostage , jeans and blue checked shirt , three feet to her right . Anothe male hostage , white pants , green shirt , Nikes , laying in front of the magazine rack . A female dirtbag with a gun under her shirt , sitting against the beer cooler , trying to pass herself off as a hostage , and there 's a special on toilet-paper , four fo a buck twenty-nine . McCall opens his eyes . Roper 's impressed .
ROPER: Very good . You 've got good eyes . That 's important .
MCCALL: Was that your partner ? Roper nods .
ROPER: Because he knew the little girl had zero chance of survival and his chances would be a little better We had a plan , but SWAT opened up too early . He got caught in the crossfire . Let 's move on Notice this . Always use the eyes to keep the connection . It almost like hypnosis . That 's the most important thing . Create a connection . You 're always on thei side
MCCALL: You 're a compulsive gambler ? Roper ignores that .
ROPER: Because there are a multitude of possibility 's . Everything is there to see if you know what to look for . You have to read the conditions , just like in a hostage situation .
MCCALL: I have two words for you Seek help .
ROPER: I have three words for you Ex-ac- ta .
MCCALL: I do .
GAMBLER: Hey , Roper .
ROPER: How you doin ' , Marv ? They sit down in a box right up front .
MCCALL: Fine .
ROPER: Ronnie Yeah , so .
MCCALL: Now she 's going out with Greg Barnett ?
ROPER: So what do you want ? An autograph .
MCCALL: I do n't know why she 'd pick him ove you . Roper throws McCall a skeptical look .
ROPER: Still needs work .
MCCALL: You 're right . I 'll never be as good a liar as you .
ROPER: Okay , we 're in good shape . We 're in good shape . McCall looks across the track .
MCCALL: The 6 horse is last .
ROPER: That 's okay . That 's his style .
MCCALL: To run last ?
ROPER: To run late ! Roper follows the horses into the turn .
MCCALL: The 6 horse is still last .
ROPER: He 'll be running at the quarter pole .
MCCALL: They need to run first and second ?
ROPER: Yeah , first and second . Roper gets to his feet .
ROPER: The jockey !
MCCALL: COME ON , RUSSELL !
ROPER: We lost .
MCCALL: We won .
ROPER: How much you wan na bet ?
MCCALL: You want to bet on whether you won your bet ? This is getting sick .
ROPER: Yes ! High fives .
MCCALL: How long you been coming here ?
ROPER: About six years . My partner took me .
MCCALL: Is it always like this ?
ROPER: Occasionally you lose .
SOLIS: We 're working on that , Joe . These things are n't quite that simple .
MCCALL: This does not look good .
ROPER: See this . Solis has me driving the shit-mobile , and he picked this up straight out of impound for fourteen grand . Probably worth thirty .
MCCALL: Police corruption . It 's everywhere .
SOLIS: This will take time to setup . I 'll have to get authorizations . Okay , you relax , and I 'll
ROPER: What do we got ?
SOLIS: 32 minutes ago the silent alarm went off , then the fire alarm . A unit was a block away , and the suspect got trapped inside .
ROPER: Any verification on numbers .
SOLIS: We 've only seen and talked to one suspect . He calls himself `` Joe '' . There 's two jewelers , two salespeople , the manager , a security guard , and an elderly woman . This particula store is where they do a lot of jewelry making and repair . They have anywhere from 8 to 10 million in raw stones on any given day , so they sure as shit did n't just wander in . They knew what they were coming for .
ROPER: What have you promised them ?
SOLIS: Just that I 'd talk to my superiors .
ROPER: Any good points of entry ? McCall shakes his head .
MCCALL: The place is designed to be a vault .
ROPER: My name 's Roper . How are you people doing in there ? Solis is off the job now , Joe . I 'm the guy authorized to give you whatever you want . That 's right , but first I need to come down there to talk to you .
KORDA: You do n't have to come here .
ROPER: Yes , I do . That way there 's no misunderstandings . I need to make sure no one 's hurt , then we can take care of business . A long pause Then a bit sinister .
KORDA: Stay there . Roper stops in his tracks .
ROPER: I 'm going to put my hands down , okay . Roper slowly lowers his hands .
KORDA: Are you in charge , Roper ?
ROPER: Yep .
KORDA: I want a car . Like a four wheel drive . I want it in perfect condition . I want a uniformed cop to drive it up ight here . I want him to leave the engine running and walk to the end of the street . Then we 'll come out . I do n't want any remote control devices in it . I know all the tricks . If it 's not in perfect condition , and I mean if its even low on wipe fluid , I 'm going to kill somebody and we 're gon na start again . Korda lets that sink in .
ROPER: Is that all ?
KORDA: For now that 's all .
ROPER: You 'll get it . But , Joe , I want you to do something for me . Let me take a look around inside . Make sure everybody 's okay .
KORDA: No . You just do shit for me right now .
ROPER: Joe , I 'm doing a lot for you . I think you could give me something to cement the deal One hostage .
KORDA: I 'll give you something .
KORDA: In fifteen minutes it 'll be a bigge piece . I assume there are no `` misunderstanding '' . Roper is as serious as we 've ever seen him .
ROPER: I understand you completely . Korda disappears back behind the door .
SOLIS: Ca n't we wear him down ?
ROPER: I believe there 's at least one fatality in there already . The fire alarm was probably set off by gunfire . I believe he 's working alone , both from his conversation and the fact that he would n't come out beyond the doorway . He was holding a gun on the hostages while he was talking to me . His demeanor is calm and controlled , that 's what really scares me . The other bad news is that he also indicated a familiarity with ou techniques . So , do you want to go in or wait fo him to come out ? McCall calmly offers his opinion .
MCCALL: Let him come out . Too many unknowns in there . Solis nods . That 'll be the plan .
SWAT CAPTAIN: Have Anderson prep it and notify us when he 's on line .
SOLIS: I feel this thing going sideways on us . Roper tries to buck him up .
ROPER: There is some good news . He 's wearing a ski mask , so he 's protecting his identity and has n't determined to kill all the hostages Yet .
KORDA: Drag them behind the counter .
WOMAN CUSTOMER: I 'm not staying here another minute .
SALESGIRL #1: No , Mrs. Dotson . Korda rushes around the display case .
KORDA: Come here , hag .
MANAGER: Leave her alone !
KORDA: You 're a brave one , are n't you ?
SALESGIRL #2: Sit down , Doug .
KORDA: If she 's not conscious when it 's time to leave , I 'll have to kill her .
ROPER: Okay . Time to give this fucker a call .
ROPER: This fucker 's not answering .
MCCALL: There 's your answer . He 's smart .
ROPER: He 's cutting down the visibility .
MCCALL: And doing a very good job of it .
SWAT CAPTAIN: All positions , you have the green light .
MCCALL: They 're out . Roper grabs a pair of binoculars .
ROPER: It 's Korda . McCall sees him now , too .
MCCALL: They switched clothes .
ROPER: Hold your fire ! Hold your fire !
MCCALL: He 's got the girl .
ROPER: Damnit !
SOLIS: Yeah , they are but
ROPER: Come on ! As Roper and McCall move toward the door
SOLIS: Roper , what are you going to do ? Do n't take my And Roper and McCall are gone .
MCCALL: Suspect heading west on Sutter now passing Jones . Can we get an intercept ? A voice comes back .
MCCALL: What the fuck is going on .
ROPER: I do n't know , but I 've got to get on there .
MCCALL: You 're crazy .
ROPER: Pull up alongside .
ROPER: Sorry , go .
KORDA: I do n't give a shit about you o your fucking friends .
ROPER: What if you and me got into a struggle and my gun went off ?
MCCALL: Roper ! Put it down ! Put it down man , we got him . Come on Put it down .
ROPER: We do this shit by the book , but you ai n't gon na be smiling .
RONNIE: You were n't at the press conference . Roper keeps tapping away at the computer .
ROPER: I wanted to get this out of the way .
RONNIE: You got a bet on the game tonight ?
ROPER: As a matter of fact , I do . She nods knowingly .
RONNIE: It 's already started .
ROPER: I was going to catch the last half on TV .
RONNIE: Good-night .
ROPER: You having dinner with Mr . Baseball ? She turns back around .
RONNIE: Greg is on a road trip . I was just going to make some pasta . He takes a few steps toward .
ROPER: That kind with the garlic and the oil that I like so much ?
RONNIE: No . The kind from Kraft , with the macaroni and the cheese .
ROPER: I 've been craving that stuff all week .
RONNIE: And it 's hard to get . He looks at her innocently .
ROPER: What do you think ?
RONNIE: Mmm , needs a little something .
ROPER: What are you talking about ? This is it . This is the stuff right here . Well , maybe just a pinch more sugar .
RONNIE: Yeah that 's it .
ROPER: Why do n't you just stick your finge in and stir it up .
RONNIE: Scottie There is a long pause as he looks at her .
ROPER: What would you say if I quit gambling ? Ronnie stirs the macaroni .
RONNIE: I 'd say you 'd be miserable It 's not the gambling . It 's what the gambling got in the way of . The track is where you 'd take your troubles instead of sharing them with me
ROPER: It 's because I wanted to keep you away from that world .
RONNIE: It 's not that world . It 's your world . It 's part of who you are .
ROPER: Veronica , it 's not easy for me I do n't know if I can change overnight . But what I 'm telling you is that I want to share everything with you , ecause I do n't ever want to be without you again .
RONNIE: It 's okay . We broke up .
ROPER: When ?
RONNIE: Just now .
CLARENCE: How ya doin ' , man ?
KORDA: You got ta do something for me this fucker , Roper , he 's got ta girlfriend . She works at the newspaper . I want you to take care of her . Clarence is totally unnerved by this request .
CLARENCE: Hey , Michael , that 's not my thing . Korda glares at him murderously .
KORDA: You got ta do this for me . I 'm in here because of you .
CLARENCE: Man , what 's this about ? Ya know , you were robbing a store . It was n't personal . It was his job .
KORDA: Fuck you ! You know what he did to me ? !
CLARENCE: Do n't make do it , Mike .
KORDA: Are you going to turn on me too ? Who helped you when you were strung out ? Who gave you money ? Who bailed you out of jail ?
CLARENCE: I wo n't get away with it .
KORDA: Nobody knows who you are . Make it look like a robbery .
ROPER: Hi , I 'm going to stop at the corne for some wine .
RONNIE: How 's Paco doing ?
ROPER: He was going nuts at the park . He met this very attractive poodle . They made plans to meet again next weekend .
RONNIE: Okay , dinner will be ready when you get here . She hangs up .
ROPER: You okay ? ! She nods . Points out the back way .
CABBY: Jesus Christ . What was he doing ? !
ROPER: Shut the fuck up ! The cabby immediately clams up .
ROPER: If you try again to hurt me or anyone I know , I 'm going to have you killed . Korda feigns total innocence .
KORDA: What in the world are you talking about , Mr. Roper ?
ROPER: Here 's a picture of your cousin Clarence . That gentleman standing over him is the coroner .
KORDA: I used to have an apartment , a car , jewelry . I had a fucking eight thousand dollar watch . Now look what I have . He motions around .
ROPER: You motherfucker , I swear I 'll kill you !
MCCALL: I 'm here to help you .
SOLIS: We got a situation at the V.A . Hospital . The responding officer has equested a negotiator .
MCCALL: Where 's Roper ?
SOLIS: He 's on his way . Get over there .
VET #1: I ca n't fight this technology . They have microprocessors made in totally sterile environments . I 've seen those places . Everyone is dressed in white . It 's like paper clothing , man . They 're not even human .
VET #2: Dave , do n't do this , bro . Pull me in . We 'll do a few laps in the park and figure out some other way . But he 's not getting through to his friend .
VET #1: I ca n't help this , man . Do you have any idea what those microchips look like ? How small they are when they put them in your brain ?
OFFICER #4: When we got here , he was already doing his balancing act . I was talking to him , but it made him more agitated so I backed off .
MCCALL: Why is he up there ?
OFFICER #4: Something about a microchip in his ain .
MCCALL: Who is he ? A NURSE answers him .
NURSE HERRIN: David Adler . He likes to be called Dave . The other guy is Walte Sinclair .
MCCALL: Another negotiator is on his way .
NURSE HERRIN: We ca n't wait for another negotiator . You have to do something .
MCCALL: What about the doctors ?
NURSE HERRIN: He hates all the doctors . He says they 're in on the conspiracy .
DAVE: Get the fuck out of here ! McCall is tense and stiff . He stammers .
MCCALL: I I 'm Kevin . I 'm here to help you , D Dave .
DAVE: You ca n't help me , man . So much for McCall 's opener . Now what ?
WALTER: He 's high on something , man . Give him some thorazine or something . Dave ignores Walter .
DAVE: No one can help me . They 're controlling my mind . McCall moves a couple steps closer .
MCCALL: Who 's controlling your mind ?
DAVE: Whoa ! The government . They control everybody 's mind . You 're too fucking stupid to know that ? McCall fumbles for the right response .
MCCALL: This has nothing to do with Walter .
DAVE: They want Walter dead !
MCCALL: Dave , look at me .
DAVE: Particles , man . I feel them all the time . I feel them in my arms and legs man , that 's how they punish me .
MCCALL: How can I help you with the particles ?
DAVE: It 's not just the particles man , it 's the whole fucking machine , this is how they get assassins to operate . It 's been this way since the cuban missile crisis .
MCCALL: They have less power over you if you look into my eyes .
DAVE: Huh ?
ROPER: Whata ya got ?
FIREMAN: Some nuts dangling a guy over the edge in a wheelchair .
ROPER: Can you get a net out here ?
FIREMAN: Negative . It 's 14 floors up . No nets gon na hold a fall from that high up .
MCCALL: We 've been onto them for a long time .
WALTER: He 's jamming them , Dave . Pull me ack in .
MCCALL: You see , the particles are gone , they ca n't punish you anymore .
DAVE: Tell my dad .
MCCALL: Tell him what , what do you want me to tell him ?
DAVE: Tell my dad I 'm sorry about the watch .
MCCALL: I 'll tell him . Where does he live . We 'll get him on the phone right now .
DAVE: I hate fucking Springfield .
MCCALL: Is that where you 're family lives ? Then with sudden swiftness .
DAVE: I still hear them , man . You ca n't jam them . They 've got the technology , man . They 've got the satellites , Jack . They keep shooting beams off those satellites . What power do I have ?
MCCALL: NOOOO !
ROPER: McCall !
MCCALL: Give me a twenty dollar four-six exacta .
TELLER: The six is scratched . This throws McCall for a beat .
MCCALL: Then give me a fucking four-seven exacta .
ROPER: It might have happened no matter who was up there .
MCCALL: Bullshit ! Would it have happened to you ?
ROPER: Maybe There 's one thing you have to remember You do n't create the situations . You can only try to save people from them .
MCCALL: I thought I could do it . I was so damn sure of myself . But I did n't know what to say . The words would n't come . My mouth turned to mush . You make it look so easy , Roper . But it is not . It 's not easy . It 's a different job than looking through the rifle scope .
ROPER: That it is . A long silent beat .
MCCALL: How many have you lost ?
ROPER: I look at it as how many I 've saved . That 's the way you 've got to look at it .
MCCALL: And what about the ones you do n't save ?
ROPER: You live with it and they haunt you . It does n't leave .
MCCALL: And what if you ca n't live with it ?
ROPER: You 've got to decide that fo yourself .
MCCALL: I do n't know I do n't know
ROPER: Let 's get out of here . McCall slowly gets up and they walk out .
HAWKINS: What the fuck You bring me all the way over here to tell me you 've got no collateral ! What do I look like to you Santa Claus ? I 'm a ail bondsman !

ROPER: It has a nice `` nose '' .
WAITER: The special this evening is braised sweetbreads with a white truffle sauce on cracked bulgar . Roper looks at him a long beat .
ROPER: That 's my favorite . Why do n't you give us a minute .
RONNIE: It 's very nice .
ROPER: I guess you realize that there 's something special that I want to talk to you about .
RONNIE: There is ?
ROPER: For the last week things have been going pretty well between us . I think we 've been doing a good job getting intimate and all that stuff Now she 's really worried .

KORDA: Johnny Hawkins . Bail Bonds . I got ta e over at county in fifteen minutes , alright ?
WOMAN: Can you believe these people ?
KORDA: It 's the criminal justice system . What can I tell ya ? It 's a mess . The guard shoves the sheet under the glass .
ROPER: How come in those foreign movies the young girl is always with some fat , old guy .
RONNIE: In Europe women find older men very sexy . Roper closes the door .
ROPER: When I get old and fat , I 'm moving to Europe . Ronnie suddenly remembers something .
RONNIE: I forgot to leave food for Paco . He 's probably starving .
ROPER: Damn , my eyes are tired from reading that movie .
RONNIE: I 'm sorry , Paco . I forgot
RONNIE: Paco , have you been eating my face soap , again ?
RONNIE: What is it , Scottie ? Roper untenses . Puts away his gun .
ROPER: Korda escaped .
RONNIE: And you think he 'll
ROPER: Hey , I 'm on edge a little . Let 's elax . I 'm sure he 's just going to try to get out of town . Anyway we leave tomorrow . He puts his arms around her waist .
RONNIE: I do n't think you 're old and fat enough for me .
ROPER: Use your imagination .
MCCALL: You sure you packed everything ? Maybe you forgot your bowling ball . Ronnie stands on the doorstep .
RONNIE: I sent that ahead , wise guy .
ROPER: It 's better if you stay inside . She climbs up the stairs toward him .
RONNIE: You 've got to calm down

FRANK: Scott , we go back a long way but you ca n't expect me to do this !
ROPER: Frank , this guy is a psychopath and he 's got Ronnie . It 's the only way I 'm going to get close to him .
FRANK: Then go to the Lieutenant or the D.A . with it , for Christsakes . You 're asking me to put my fucking job on the line !
ROPER: They 'll never approve it , you know that . Besides , I involve the department and she 's dead . I got one chance with this guy , Frank , alone . He killed Sam and he 'll kill her .
FRANK: I hope to God I never have to make that decision He pushes back from the counter .
ROPER: I owe you one , Frank . He walks down the hallway .
MCCALL: Mare Island is an abandoned shipyard , cranes , high buildings he 'll be in place where he can see everything . How are we going to get me in there ?
ROPER: Good question .
MCCALL: Right here , Scott .
ROPER: Where is she , Korda ? I want to see her . From the darkness beyond
KORDA: Walk to the table . Roper walks to a steel SHOP TABLE .
ROPER: I 'm not wearing a wire . This is just etween you and me .
KORDA: My sentiments exactly .
MCCALL: Wait for the right moment , Scott
KORDA: Fill it up . Just in case there 's a homing device in the other one .

CROCKETT: How lucky 's Miss Universe got ta be ?
TUBBS: Skin has to touch skin . That 's the equirement for the warrant . Then he makes a credible excuse and he stops . Her crew blackmailed and asset- stripped the last mark down to his social security
GINA: This I got ta see the `` make up an excuse and stop '' part .
CROCKETT: Have faith .
GINA: I have faith . In horoscopes and fortune cookies
TUBBS: So ?
GINA: Switek pulling this off ? That 's not faith ; that 's delusional
TUBBS: Damn , girl
RICK: That 's 'cause nothing is happening .
CROCKETT: No shit ?
FRANK: Yeah . This is thei surveillancehow they video thei marks ? See , we jacked their fibe optics , like we piggybacked thei signal . Get it ?

TUBBS: He did volunteer one time
TRUDY: For a massage parlor bust ? Why am I here ?
TUBBS: to backup Switek . But only if it gets lethal .
TRUDY: That 's impossible .
TUBBS: Why ?
TRUDY: Because you can not kill him .
TUBBS: And there 's Dmitri
CROCKETT: The honey trap . And there 's the honey .
TUBBS: Hello , Miss Ukraine
TRUDY: Eleven to seven he blows it .
CROCKETT: Twenty on my man
TRUDY: You 're giving away your money , fool
TUBBS: You bet your partner ?
ZITO: Sure . Switek versus primal impulse from the amygdala . Higher thinking versus the lizard brain . Tectonic plates of libido confront the cognitive .
GINA: Oh , bullshit . She cops his joint . He pushes the button .
TRUDY: What 's so fucking difficult ?
CROCKETT: Yeah ?
STEVENS: It 's fucked up . I 'm sorry
CROCKETT: Alonzo ? What are you talking about ? Where are you ?
STEVENS: They had me from the gate .
CROCKETT: I do n't understand
STEVENS: I gave up nothing on you guys . Do n't worry . I kept you and Rico out of it . Only the Feds . They 're on their ownit 's all their deal , anyway , so fuck 'em .
CROCKETT: Where are you ?
TUBBS: What is it ?
CROCKETT: Alonzo

CROCKETT: Something 's wrong . Crockett 's entering a number while
TUBBS: I 'll try Francine Meanwhile Crockett HEARS
MACHINE VOICE: Federal Bureau of Investigation . Our office hours are
CROCKETT: This is Detective Crockett . Miami- Dade P.D . Patch me through to you Special Agent in Charge , James Fujima ? It 's an emergency
FBI AGENT: He 'll be in on Monday
CROCKETT: I said , `` emergency . '' If he 's not eachable , who 's running the weekend ? The ASAC ?
FBI AGENT: We do n't give that out
CROCKETT: Listen carefully .
TUBBS: C'mon
CROCKETT: Hello ?
FUJIMA: How do I discuss operations over an open line ?
CROCKETT: How do I know ? I got the call from Alonzo on an open line . That is the hand we have been dealt at this moment , at eleven-forty-seven o'clock Friday night . Okay ? I am trying to alert you , here . You know whether or notyou have a thing goin ' down . I do not . But we know this guy . I think you know this guy . Normally , he is cool . Tonight he is distraught . That is atypical . That engenders foreboding . Do you understand the meaning of the word `` foreboding '' ? As in badness is happening to you deal right fucking now ?
FUJIMA: Guy 's involved in a `` meet ''
CROCKETT: `` Buy and walk '' ? `` Buy and bust '' ? `` Reverse undercover '' ? What ?
FUJIMA: Meet and greet . `` I flash you some of mine , you flash me some of yours ? ''
CROCKETT: And the deal goes down at anothe place at another time .
FUJIMA: That 's right .
CROCKETT: so there 's no industrial- strength HRT weapons team out there tonight ?
FUJIMA: Correct . Flash samples . Flash cash .
TUBBS: Haitian , Dominican , Russian , Israeli ?
FUJIMA: White supremacist types . Crockett 's impatient .
CROCKETT: OMGs , Mongols , Nazi Low-Riders , prison gangs ?
FUJIMA: NLR , we think . I wan na know
TUBBS: Oh , good
FUJIMA: what else , what else did he indicate to you ? I need to know everything he said .
CROCKETT: He is saying they had him from the gate . He is saying to my partne and I and to his family `` goodbye . '' What does that tell you ?
SWITEK: Sonny , we got him
RUSSIAN #1: sample now is okay . And we want sample load when we do deal
ARYAN BROTHER: Sure , man .
RUSSIAN #1: What inventory you can supply ?
RUSSIAN: Never seen money before ? This is called `` money . ''
ARYAN BROTHER: Hey , Ivan ! I forgot to ask you something , my brother
TUBBS: What the hell did you do ?
STEVENS: The Feeb gig was I front a coupla undercover , Russian-speakers to them . One 's ATF . And broker the deal . Set up the meet with the NLR types
CROCKETT: How 'd they get onto you ?
STEVENS: How do I know ? But it was from the get-go . Knew the FBI had run me into them . Sonny , I got ta go !
TRUDY: Hello , Sonny ?
STEVENS: I got ta , I got ta go !
TUBBS: Alonzo
STEVENS: What ?
TUBBS: Alonzo , you do n't need to go home . Now Alonzo knows .
STEVENS: They said they would n't hurt them , would n't hurt them if
TUBBS: They lied .
CROCKETT: They been known to do that
TUBBS: Yeah .
CASTILLO: Grieve elsewhere .
FUJIMA: We 're not certain
CASTILLO: You said Nazi Low-riders ?
FUJIMA: We 're not certain !
TUBBS: C'mon , man !
FUJIMA: We think NLR . We do n't know ! Alonzo only fronted as a broker fo our guys to make the meet . He was n't deep into the crew .
CROCKETT: White gangs ? It does n't track .
TUBBS: White gangs is tweakers and a crystal meth lab in a trailer park . Bounce around the old lady Saturday night and get your recidivist ass usted back
FUJIMA: Not anymore . This is a distribution network out of South Florida , moving poly-drug loads , crystal meth through coke , to Nashville , Atlanta , Memphis , Cleveland . And computer fraud , identity theft . It 's like that .
CASTILLO: Tell them what you want .
FUJIMA: They knew about Alonzo , before he made a move on them . They had ou operation . They 've cut into us .
CROCKETT: How ?
FUJIMA: We do n't know .
TUBBS: Break your encryption ? Hack your e- mail ? Employee databases ? Somebody on the inside ?
FUJIMA: We do n't know . And that 's the point . Maybe there 's a mole . Whatever , it 's a disaster . And it 's a Joint Interagency Task Force . I have DEA , ATF , U.S. Customs components in on it . So the penetration could be from any one agency . What we do know is I have to suspend operations right now from undercover work through interdictions 'cause I have to assume our Operational Security is lown .
TUBBS: As in , your ass is dead in the water .
FUJIMA: But Miami PD was n't part of the J.I.T . And from what Alonzo said , he did n't give you up .
CROCKETT: So what do you want ?
FUJIMA: To recruit you . Pause .
CASTILLO: I did n't want you around the crime scene because it 's crawling with federal law enforcement . We do n't know who 's straight up , who 's not
CROCKETT: Recruit us to do what ?
FUJIMA: Get into business with this crew , identify them . Illuminate thei network . If you 're lucky , discove their source , how they penetrated us . We 'll indict and take it from there
CROCKETT: How do we do that ? Make a buy ? That went well
TUBBS: Reverse undercover ? WE supply to them ?
FUJIMA: They got a steady stream of supply . So , no
CROCKETT: From whom ?
FUJIMA: A Colombian producer . Named Archangel de Jesus Montoya-Londono .
CROCKETT: Never heard of him .
FUJIMA: From the North Valle area . New . Low-level , we think .
TUBBS: Aryan brothers are not going to change-up suppliers . So
CROCKETT: Transpo ? How they bringing the loads in ?
FUJIMA: They 're not . They collect in Miami . Montoya , the producer , handles deliveries . That 's his end , and he varies the routes . We got some FLIR off an AWAC of a coupla go-fast boats , on one run , that 's all .
TUBBS: Track with me , here They knew the `` Russians '' were undercover Feeb ? They should have no-showed . But , no , these guys show anyway , and commit murder upon federal officers . And steal all your money What does that say to you ?
CROCKETT: It says , `` We do not fear you . '' It says , `` Fuck off and die . '' It says , `` We get down fo ecreation ''
TUBBS: So ?
CROCKETT: We could try to run loads into these guys . Run a few loads for Montoya into South Florida . Into this group .
FUJIMA: You need to consider a few issues .
CASTILLO: you 'd be operating outside territorial United States . You adges do not count . You have no authorization to carry weapons . If you 're busted , it could take a long time to get you re-patriated . And there 's no backup And you will share with them all your intel on Montoya
FUJIMA: Sure .
CASTILLO: I mean full disclosure .
FUJIMA: Of course . From my side , I do n't WANT to know anything about what you 're doing or how you do it So let me know if we 're on
CASTILLO: About the Stevens family , I 'm sorry . I know you were close to them .
TUBBS: I was the kids ' godfather .
CASTILLO: And ?
TUBBS: `` And '' what ?
CASTILLO: I got to know . There is never any oom for `` personal ''
CROCKETT: He is fine . And we know the jokes . When it gets vengeful , things get messy . When they get messy the wrong people die Everybody gets it .
CASTILLO: Good .
TUBBS: And the answer is `` yes . '' Before she met Alonzo , once upon a time , a long time ago . You bet it was personal . and is now compartmentalized in the past .
CASTILLO: Okay . What 'd you spot ?
CROCKETT: Three wakes off the back of those oats . Who runs three Sterling engines off a deep-V hull ?
TUBBS: Sal Maguda .
CASTILLO: He any good ?
TUBBS: Oh , yeah
CASTILLO: So what 's gon na persuade Montoya to change off Sal Maguda running his deliveries ? It 's a rhetorical question .
BASTIDE: Odile , she say they 're pregnant We do n't know what that means , yet .
TUBBS: Yeah ? Okay . Only Jean-Louis and I do the talking
TUBBS: Comme on dit
BAD GUY: You crazy ? Que fais-tu ?
TUBBS: Que faisons-nous ? De qu ' a-t-il l'air , fou ! Nous voulons tous votre drugs .
CROCKETT: Hey , Sailor Yeah , I 'm good . Got a hole in the calendarlooking to charge up the cash flow . Yeah , later . Crockett struck out . While
TUBBS: Hey , Nicholas , my ace . Wha 's up ?
NICHOLAS: It is fortuitous that you called
CROCKETT: We 're from Nicholas to meet José
JOSÉ YERO: José
CROCKETT: Sonny Burnettthis is my partner , Rico .
JOSÉ YERO: Sit .
CROCKETT: Dos café .
TUBBS: So lay it out , my brother
JOSÉ YERO: Nicholas said you okay . That 's nice . But how I know if you any good ?
CROCKETT: What ?
JOSÉ YERO: Who you run loads for ? Cause othe than Nicholas , you knows you ?
CROCKETT: My mommy and daddy know me . Isabella tilts her head imperceptibly .
TUBBS: And we did n't come down here to audition . Business auditions fo us and know who we are and know they want their load run by us efore Nicholas calls .
CROCKETT: That way we do not waste AvGas o our motherfucking time .
TUBBS: You wearing a wire ? Tubbs rips open Yero 's shirt .
CROCKETT: Or DEA ? The Feeb ?
TUBBS: People gon na walk into this place and say , `` Ola , hijo ! That some crazy wallpaper . Whewit wild ! Is that a Jackson Pollack ? ''
CROCKETT: `` No , viejo . That was José Yero , splattered all over his motherfucking wall . ''
TUBBS: So we can close each other 's eyes ight now . Real easy . Real fast . But , then , nobody makes any money
JOSÉ YERO: Equipment ?
TUBBS: Slow and low , Adam A-500s carbon composite , stealthy , 1400 nautical-mile range , thousand ki payloadall the way to Caravels and 727 's from a source country to a transshipment point . Small freighters . We 've done containers
CROCKETT: And specialize in very fast go-fast oats for coastal runs .
TUBBS: What kind of weight ?
JOSÉ YERO: We do n't talk weight . We talk logistics .
CROCKETT: The people on shore who handle a load we run are our people , not you people . No tweakers , dopers , first- timers we do n't know . They did n't do time with us , they ai n't doing crime with us .
TUBBS: What you get from us is a date . A place . `` In the parking lot of a Jack-in-the-Box in north Miami . '' At such-and-such time , an eighteen- wheeler will be there . Keys in the ignition . Ready to roll . You pick it up . And you drive it away .
CROCKETT: Money thing is done in advance in places where there are no guns . Because when money and guns get together , there is violence
JOSÉ YERO: You afraid of violence ?
CROCKETT: I am not John Wayne . There is no `` S '' on his chest . We get down if the play calls for it . But we are into business and making money .
TUBBS: And violence is extra . And expensive . So how much weight you looking to move ?
JOSÉ YERO: Nothing . 'Cause how you do delivery on the beach , I do n't like . Maybe this does not work .
CROCKETT: Then it do n't work .
TUBBS: What happened to the last transporter you had ?
JOSÉ YERO: What do you care ?
TUBBS: Do we need this ?
CROCKETT: Red light , green light , José ?
JOSÉ YERO: I 'm also called `` Cochi Loco . '' That means `` Crazy pig . '' 'Cause I enforce security and get people to tell me what I need to know . That part of what I do , you never want to find out about . Other people will negotiate the money and go or not go . Not me
TUBBS: Then what were we talking to you for ?
JOSÉ YERO: I had to lay eyes on you .
CROCKETT: And ? Isabella watches Crockett
JOSÉ YERO: You seem okay . But him ? I do n't like how he looks
TUBBS: What do I care what you think about how he looks ? You wan na fuck my partner or do business ?
JOSÉ YERO: Wait by the phone . You get a call . Or maybe you do n't . Until then , piss off back to where you come from
TUBBS: Sonny can wait .
CROCKETT: Nothing . Gina enters in a robe
GINA: `` Hi , Gina . Hi , Sonny . ''
CROCKETT: Hi , Gina . This is from Frick and Frack . Trudy ?
TUBBS: What do we got ?
CROCKETT: Satellite . New encryption . Supposedly sharper than the G How good 's our background ?
GINA: You 're so not the PD , if you got usted on a DUI , you 're in serious troubleyou 're bad men back to grammar school . San Quentin . Pelican Bay . Marine Corps . Statesville . Pelican Bay , where you guys hooked up . Now you 're too smart and too fast to get jacked again
CROCKETT: How will it stand up ?
GINA: If they ran the rental car or lease on this placeeven if it 's EPIC database in El Pasothey 'd have to work through the layers of ullshit three weeks deep . Then they 'd find your deeper , hidden criminal selves
TUBBS: Reality TV and stay by the phone . That 's what all wives-in-crime do
GINA: Becareful You hear me ?
TUBBS: Where we meeting 'em ?
CROCKETT: Port-Au-Prince .
TUBBS: Five minutes
TUBBS: They watching us watching them watching us waiting for them ? O what ?

TUBBS: Define small .
ISABELLA: Two , three thousand a ki . Two thousand ki 's , your end is

TUBBS: Thank you .

TUBBS: Good idea . We 'll grab a bite .
GINA: the lease , the phones , the carslayers of false ident . Would take the FBI weeks . How long did it take them ? Three hours ? Four ? This means , `` We can reach out and touch somebody . '' Like Bad Teleflora .
TUBBS: even if they could run the identities you built to EPIC , all they 'll find is more cover Trust what you built . It 's quality , girl . We 're cool
GINA: you are trying to reassure me ecause you know when people get anxious , they make mistakes . You 're worried about me . Do not e. I am careful . I am cool . I got Trudy , backup , whatever . You worry about you . Because you are the ones who are in denied territory , not me . If your focus is on me , you 'll miss something coming at you . That 's how people slip up . Get hurt . And I 'd die if anything happened . You worry about you . You and Sonnyare in the dangerous place . I 'm fine
CROCKETT: We set .
TUBBS: To the limit .
CROCKETT: You worried about the tree line , US Customs AWACS , or something else on your mind ?
TUBBS: Like ?

TUBBS: You do n't like us finding you load ? We can go and lose it all over again
CROCKETT: How 'bout this ? How 'd Neptune know where to hit us ? Huh ? Whose Op sec 's got a leak ? Yours ?
JOSÉ YERO: What 'd Neptune tell you ?

ISABELLA: And what is that ?
CROCKETT: Let me buy you a drink .
ISABELLA: What do you like to drink ?
CROCKETT: I 'm a fiend for mojitas .
ISABELLA: How fast does that go ?
CROCKETT: It goes very fast .
ISABELLA: Show me ?

CROCKETT: I know what I 'm doing .
TUBBS: secure satellite comms . encrypted e-mail , the longs and lats for the transshipment pointall that ? It 's all cool . But I need a vector , not a location . 'Cause ships move . That 's why they call them ships . Ship stops ? It 's trying to be an apartment building . At sea that attracts attention . That 's bad Meanwhile
CROCKETT: So where 's the best place fo mojitas ?
ISABELLA: Bodeguita del Medio . It 's the only place for mojitas
CROCKETT: Where 's that ?
ISABELLA: Off a little alley with cobblestones . Hemingway went there
CROCKETT: The Keys ?
ISABELLA: Havana .
CROCKETT: Havana ? Cubans do n't like us or my usiness
ISABELLA: Are you afraid ? Good . And you do n't need a visa . Cause you 're with me .
ISABELLA: My cousin is the harbor master . You must not bring in drugs . You can not be armed . If you 're carrying , it has to go . Or stow it inside . No one will go near you oat
CROCKETT: You do business in Cuba with you husband ?
ISABELLA: I never do business in Cuba . And nobody goes to Cuba but me . And he is not my husband
CROCKETT: Were you born in Havana ?
ISABELLA: Angola . My mother was being a surgeon there . She volunteered . Mozambique and Mali , too those days , in those daysshe was part of Cuba 's gift to the third world . She came from a ourgeois family with a house in Verdadowe still have the house . We will go there
CROCKETT: Where 's she now ?
ISABELLA: She 's dead
CROCKETT: Your father ?
ISABELLA: Angolan Military . Went back to the fighting . Disappeared . Who knows ?
CROCKETT: How 's he not your husband ?
ISABELLA: I am no one 's wife . I live in my own house . I do not live in a man 's house . He has a wife . We are together . I am free . Because of banking and finance and travel And I can do anything I want
ISABELLA: Later ! Do you dance ?

CROCKETT: No .
ISABELLA: I insist .
CROCKETT: Okay . Macon , Georgia is where I was born . Wound up in a juvenile facility . I was 14 . Then the military . Then prison . Because I was dumb and angry . Then I read . Then I got smart . Then I discovered what I know , nowit 's all business Isabella smiles . CROCKETT My friend , two more . What was your mother 's name ?
ISABELLA: Blancaa rubio like you . I see her in a dressan old photograph from Lucinda somebody 's weddingeverybody is with couples . Husbands and wives . They all pose . My mother is alone ecause my father had to go back to the fighting . she looks right into the camera . She is the most beautiful woman in the room . By herself . In a party dress . And she looked like she knew she would die alone She spoke many languages . We were in Luanda when she died . I went to her friends in Mali . They sent me to the Ecole Polytechnique in Geneva to study mathematics , where I met Montoya in the discos . He had banking thereI was seventeen and very much into the clubs . And he sent me to University for an MBA in Finance . Your mother ?
CROCKETT: Died in childbirth , having me
ISABELLA: To mothers . And all that we owe them
CROCKETT: You know how improbable this is ?
ISABELLA: `` Probable '' applies to an event that may be real . Does n't apply here .
CROCKETT: 'cause we have no futureare of today and not tomorrow .
ISABELLA: That 's right .
CROCKETT: and therafore there is no consequence ?
ISABELLA: Exactly .
CROCKETT: Let 's talk deliveries .
ISABELLA: Like ?
CROCKETT: Like `` three thousand a ki ? '' That 's nice . And I can supply the transportation into South Florida and the Gulf , more reliable and on-time than FedEx . But , three per ki was OK for openers .
ISABELLA: And why should continuing excellence cost more ?
CROCKETT: Cost less . That 's the point .
ISABELLA: Is it December ?
CROCKETT: What do you mean ?
ISABELLA: Did Christmas come early this year ?
CROCKETT: Better than that . We become partners . Only in this territory and only on loads we run . And you do n't pay us three thousand a ki . You pay us zero . Why we get is thirty percent of the load . Product or cash . `` And why , '' you 're thinking , `` would I be crazy enough to out in these gringos like that ? Is he chipping ? Crazy for my love ? Too many mojitas ? '' And the answe is , `` of course '' but also `` no . It is because Sonny can deliver what no one else can . ''
ISABELLA: Good samba dancing ?
CROCKETT: Zero risk .
ISABELLA: 'Cause you do n't lose loads ?
CROCKETT: 'Cause we guarantee every load . Anywhere , for any reason , it comes up short , we make good . You operations will , from now on , run isk-free .
ISABELLA: And you 're our thirty-percent partner ?
CROCKETT: Then I would say to you , this has een fun
ISABELLA: The range should be between fifteen and seventeen-point-five percent of the P.O.E.to even consider it .
CROCKETT: I need thirty . Calculate in , also , the cash you do n't have to front
ISABELLA: Available cash is not an issue fo us
CROCKETT: Twenty-eight-point-five .
ISABELLA: What if I pushed to twenty-one ?
CROCKETT: I would say you 're four percentage points away from a deal
ISABELLA: Maybe I 'm only one . And she slides into his arms . And smiles
CROCKETT: We 'll do it at twenty-two
ISABELLA: And now I make you breakfast again
CROCKETT: On my way back
TUBBS: The meet with Castillo and the fed got set up . It 's in 45 minutes
GINA: What 's up , Sonny ? Crockett looks at her . He has no answer .

CROCKETT: Hit a couple of jazz clubs . Fell ack to her place .
TUBBS: Where ?
CROCKETT: Verdado .
TUBBS: Verdado where ?
CROCKETT: It 's in the suburbs outside Havana .
TUBBS: Havana , Cuba ?
CROCKETT: No . Havana , Louisiana . Do n't we have a meet ?
TUBBS: where you 're makin ' a move on the wife of Archangel de Jesus Montoya ?
CROCKETT: No .
TUBBS: You 're not makin ' a move on her ?
CROCKETT: We 're makin ' moves on each other .
TUBBS: Oh , that makes it okay , then .
FUJIMA: Who said , `` go exploring '' ? We want this staying on track .
CROCKETT: Who 's the `` we '' ? There 's you and there 's us . And all we got from you was bad intel . `` Low-level producer . '' Yeah , right
FUJIMA: What are you talking about ?
CROCKETT: Montoya . We went to meet the village priest . It turns into Alice in the fucking Vatican and here 's the Popeof the North Valle Colombia dope trade .
TUBBS: His operations are kingpin size and first-class . His security is ex- Eastern bloc , ex-SAS and Israelis . Their comms are satellite uplink with mainframe encryption , significant Sig Int and in thei zones of activity , they have signal- jamming capability Fujima is surprised
CROCKETT: Yeah . CIA-level stuff
TUBBS: And what does that level of spending on first-class , private- sector infrastructure signify to you ?
CROCKETT: Mega-tonnage and mega-cash flow
FUJIMA: Out of ?
CROCKETT: Haiti and Puerto Rico . Money through Dubai and Geneva maybe .
TUBBS: Their loads are poly-drug . `` E '' from Holland , methamphetamine precursors from Jordan , Afghan `` H. '' Mid-ocean transshipments . His real usiness is he 's a network .
CROCKETT: And we can illuminate part of it from the inside out .
TUBBS: So we want to change-up the mission statement .
FUJIMA: Identify and indict the white supremacist group of importers . End of story . Everything else I 'm hearing is speculation masquerading as intel Crockett flips him a set of keys . FUJIMA What 's this ?
CROCKETT: Keys to the boat . Go do this motherfucker yourself .
FUJIMA: Who are you talking to ?
TUBBS: He 's talking to you , bro . What he means to say is he is eluctant to abandon the penetration of a majo narcotrafficking organization
CROCKETT: Hey , fuck him .
TUBBS: Chill out Sonny .
CROCKETT: We 're the ones doing the death- defying shit ? And he wants us to give that up ? For what ? A chump-change bust so he can get his picture in The Miami Herald to impress the slug farm in DC
FUJIMA: Control your men .
CROCKETT: I 'm my own man . And anytime you want to see how much man I am ?
CASTILLO: That 's . It . Everybody shuts up . CASTILLO Where are you on this ?
TUBBS: With Sonny . 110 % .
CASTILLO: Then that 's it . Change the mission statement . Crockett stays in . He keeps working up the ladder . The local importers get a pass for the time being .
FUJIMA: I do n't know .
CASTILLO: Yes you do
FUJIMA: I got to talk to my ADO
CASTILLO: No , you do n't , Jim . 'Cause if I close this down , you got nothing to make a phone call about . And my guys do n't have a week for a Feeb bureaucratic process . Every hour longer they 're in there , they risk exposure . So , ight here , right now , they 're back in or I pull them out and close you down . What 's it going to be ? Fujima nods acquiescence .
FUJIMA: Okay . He leaves . When he 's out of earshot
CASTILLO: You fuckin ' better be right !
TUBBS: What is going on ? !
CROCKETT: As in ?
TUBBS: There is `` undercover . '' And there is `` Which way is up ? ''
CROCKETT: You think I am in so deep I forgot ?
TUBBS: I am asking . You to me .
CROCKETT: Do you believeI have forgotten I am a cop ?
TUBBS: I would never doubt you . This is the answer Crockett needed to hear . TUBBS And do you doubt I will slot anyone complicit in the death of Maria , Alonzo and those children ? Anyonewhoever they are
CROCKETT: No , I do not . And we know that might mean Isabella .
ISABELLA: and we 're looking at Nigerian crude
MONTOYA: Precursor shipments from Ras Tanura and Ju'aymah ?
ISABELLA: Transshipped to a Malaysian container ship .
MONTOYA: Not French registry ?
ISABELLA: They 've been targeted . And Pakistani registry is too vulnerable to search and seizure ight now .
MONTOYA: José does n't like the deal in South Florida
ISABELLA: Burnett ? They want 22 % of the value on loads they run into South Florida . It 's the Juarez cartel model . They guarantee the loads . The upside is our risk goes to zero . That frees-up capital .
MONTOYA: But what does your intuition tell you ?
ISABELLA: My `` intuition '' ? My intuition made him breakfast the othe morning in Havana .
MONTOYA: And ?
ISABELLA: They 're serious . They 're cautious . They 'll forgo a deal over a technicality of how a delivery 's handledthey 'd walk away , rathe than compromise operational securitythat 's good . Montoya 's thoughtful . ISABELLA But they have to be watched closely
MONTOYA: Why ?
ISABELLA: A good deal , like this with us , fo Burnett will be good only temporarily . He 'll get restless ecause he believes nothing is forever . Life is dust , make it while you can . He 's ambitious . Montoya appreciates her thoughtfulness . ISABELLA So I predict a few good runs . Then there 'll be a renegotiation .
MONTOYA: That 's my girl
ISABELLA: I think José suspects anybody he does n't intimidate . And people , who are good at what they do ? They have egos , too
MONTOYA: What would you do ?
ISABELLA: I like the diminished risk . It frees up capital reserves . I like working with self-interested usinessmen who are competent . You can predict their behavior .
MONTOYA: Let 's try a few runs with these partners , I think . I will tell José
CROCKETT: Hola , chica .
ISABELLA: Hola , viejo . He touches the side of her face .
MONTOYA: Do you have him ?
JOSÉ YERO: They are `` wrong . '' I do not trust them .
TUBBS: Uh-uh . No predetermined places and times to meet . Give me thei heading and radio codes and I will talk to them directly with the longs and lats and time which will e a last minute deal
JOSÉ YERO: You give yours to me . We position all the assets hauling our loads
CROCKETT: Now how we do it , blood . It risks signal interception and other bad things like people who do n't need to know where we 're at knowing .
TUBBS: At ten to three on the 27th , I will satellite page him with a website and encryption code . He will have ten minutes to log on and receive his new heading . Ten minutes and thirty seconds , website disappears and he can drive his fucking boat up to Iceland José Yero does n't like it .
JOSÉ YERO: Malaysian registry . Small containership . Give them their codes and heading .
CROCKETT: Packaging ?
JOSÉ YERO: Fifty-gallon drums . Thirty-two . A hundred kilos in each . You transship that to the Malaysian oat .
TUBBS: Importation value ? At twenty-two thousand a ki
JOSÉ YERO: You work that out with La Senora . You will get sixteen fuel bladders of crystal meth precursors from the Malaysian ship . For collection in North Miami . You warehouse it . Release it when we say . I 'm sure you have friends with fast oats
CROCKETT: If you see a few new faces , do n't get jumpy
TUBBS: And José , my ace , lots of transshipment . Lots of action . Skies are crowded . And the JIT has assets on land , air , and sea . So any intel you got that can come our way and contribute to the good and welfare ? José Yero 's on the spot .
JOSÉ YERO: Sure . Check your e-mail .
JOSÉ YERO: You know what Escobar used to do ?
EL TIBURON: What ?
JOSÉ YERO: In the '80 's , air routes came into favor . It required many pilots . The best were American . Forme crop-dusters . They did n't fly by the book . Tell one `` Put that 747 down on this fifteen-hundred-foot unway . '' Somehow , he 'd do it . Great pilots . But Pablo had a ule . After they flew six loadsthis good pilot who facilitates so much good usiness he would come back to Medellín or Barranquilla to pick up the next load ? And no one would ever see him again . He 'd disappear . `` You a good pilot ? Make a lot of money for Pablo ? Thank you very much . '' And then Pablo would kill his ass . Afte six loads . And who was Pablo Escobar ? A provincial who got busted-out by the white collars from Cali . When the gringos got him , he was nobody . We 're three times better than Pablo Escobar . The means we kill these sonsabitches three times sooner . And do you know why Pablo Escoba did that ?
EL TIBURON: Why ?
JOSÉ YERO: He did n't like pilots .
ISABELLA: I forgot the napkins .
CROCKETT: And the chopsticks and fortune cookies ?
ISABELLA: What 's the best fortune you eve got ?
CROCKETT: They 're all the same . `` Financial security is around the corner . '' `` Your friends love you . ''
ISABELLA: In Kowloon , once , I got one that said , `` Live now because life is dust . ''
CROCKETT: Do you have assets somewhere else ? Bank accounts ?
ISABELLA: Why ?
CROCKETT: to fall back on . You know , a fail-safe . Insurance .
ISABELLA: Do I need it ?
CROCKETT: Everybody needs it . Ask Prudential . Or Allstate .
ISABELLA: 'Cause whatever can go wrong , will ?
CROCKETT: Something like that . The odds catch up with you . The odds are like gravity . You ca n't negotiate with them . Soat some point , you should cash out , take your money and run
ISABELLA: Really ?
CROCKETT: Sure . As far away and as fast as you can .
ISABELLA: When ?
CROCKETT: Whenever . Maybe later , maybe sooner . What is Sonny Crockett trying to say to her ?
ISABELLA: Would you find me ?
CROCKETT: Of course .
ISABELLA: Where would I go ?
CROCKETT: Zanzibar . The Comoros Islands . Somewhere in the Indian Ocean . There 's twelve-hundred islands there
ISABELLA: Is this the protective male talk ?
CROCKETT: This is the talk of a manif he were your husbandhe would neve put you at risk . He would neve put you within a thousand miles of anything that could hurt you .
ISABELLA: And if I were in the Comoros , in the Indian Ocean , where would you e ?
CROCKETT: A few more moments , still in this usiness . Then I 'd find you .
ISABELLA: Would you ? Because if you could n't , I would be very lonely I would have left the only world I know and have known since I was seventeen . But none of this will happen . So it does n't matter . Because we are on the Guajira Peninsula . And all you see around youlook around is Archangel de Jesus Montoya- Londono . He is my man . And you are a smuggler moving a load
CROCKETT: in the morning .
ISABELLA: I 'll be on board by noon . Crockett did n't expect that . ISABELLA What did you think ? This deal with you is my deal . I am responsible .
CROCKETT: Go ahead .
TRUDY: Too fast . Too many moving parts .
CROCKETT: Switek ? Zito joins them .
SWITEK: Same . But it 's your call , boss . Tubbs joins them .
CROCKETT: What 's your take ?
TUBBS: What 's the point ? It 's going down .
CROCKETT: Call the US Coast Guard `` Come and arrest our ass . '' And Switek resumes romancing Miss Ukraine
TRUDY: If we were for real , and knew ou shit , we 'd fade this one
CROCKETT: Then you should .
TRUDY: If you 're down , we 're down for the play .

She 's here now Crockett puts him on speaker . JOSÉ YERO So I want you to deliver my product , how I want my product delivered .
CROCKETT: What friend ?

TUBBS: Meaning ?
ISABELLA: They will kill you . And then they will kill your wife , too .
CROCKETT: Yero , by himself ?

TUBBS: Trudy and I are goin ' for Gina
ISABELLA: If they attack you
CROCKETT: it 's gon na be an L-shaped ambush . They 're not gon na open up until they got the party favors , 'cause all they 'd get is a lot of police scrambling to a gunfight . They will wait till they got the goods before they do the deed .

ARYAN BROTHER: You order Chinese ?
TRUDY: PUT DOWN THE DETONATOR !

JOE'S VOICE: It ai n't right , stealing from a pregnant lady .
RATSO: What did it cost her ? The laundromat syndicate lost a couple coins . I 'm crying .
JOE: Hey , you 're good ! I bet you could pick up a living at this if you tried .
RATSO: And end up a hunchback like my old man ? You think I 'm crippled ? You shoulda caught him the end of a day .
RATSO'S VOICE: You think it 's funny ?
RATSO: Stupid bastard coughed his lungs out breathing that resin all day . They buried him with gloves on . Even the fag undertaker could n't get his nails clean .
JOE: Kee-rist , you pretty damn cleve for a skimpy little gimp .
RATSO: You like it ? Take a look .

BILLY: If I get bail , Mister Yesil , they say it 's easy to cross the borde into Greece ?

BILLY: DAD !
FATHER: Oh Jesus !
BILLY'S VOICE: Dear Susan . 1970 has now passed into 1971 . You can drift in here and never know you 're gone . You can fade so far out and you do n't know where you are anymore or where anything else is
VOICE: I feel myself drifting more heavily into smoking hashish . The haze helps the time pass . Also I do soap carvings . Erich taught me . And I have been learning Turkish ecause it helps me to deal with the guards and the prisoners . I 'm trying hard to maintain some sort of schedule to my life , but sometimes it seems like I 'm just trying in order to try
BILLY'S VOICE: In the daytimes we sometimes play volleyball against the big Turkish gangsters
BILLY VOICE: Even the yoga I sometimes do is `` ayip '' - too suggestive
BILLY'S VOICE: And you 're never supposed to eat with your left hand . You know why ? Because that 's what they use to wipe their asses with instead of toilet paper . And yet they hate pigs . There are no pigs in Turkey . They 're considered dirty
BILLY VOICE: So is homosexuality . That 's a big crime here but most of them do it every chance they get . There are about a thousand things that are `` ayip '' . But they 're really so hypocritical , like children breaking the rules . For instance Suddenly a CRY OFF and
HAMIDOU: Unfortunately my youngest son Arief is having problems with his teeth ; he needs braces , but dentists are so expensive these days
ASLAN: Poor kid You know I have a friend , a very good friend ; he 's a dentist ; maybe he could get you some braces at a reasonable price .
HAMIDOU: ) Oh , noit 's out of the questionwould n't want to ask your friend
ASLAN: Yes . Please ! As a favour I insist They go on , each protesting .
BILLY VOICE: Hamidou hints that he needs new aces for one of his sons . Aslan of course has a friend who 's a dentist . They bullshit for half an hour and Hamidou finally accepts the `` Baksheesh '' in return
BILLY'S VOICE: it happened to be a new guard that day and he did n't understand the system .
GUARD: No . It 's too early .
ASLAN: Open the fucking Gate , you asshole ! Do you know who I am ? You want to get in trouble !
GUARD: Hey , I your mother ! Get back to your bunk .
PRISON DIRECTOR: Aslanbe reasonable . Come down and talk .
BILLY'S VOICE: A week later Aslan had a new gun
BILLY: Everything is `` sula-bula '' which means `` like this , like that '' - you never know what will happen . One day one of the new kids was raped in the children 's kogus , so they picked out six of the worst kids
HAMIDOU: PIS ! PIS '' Then stops .
BILLY VOICE: Then there 's Ziat . The more I know of him
MAX: Ten dollars for this shit ? You greedy one-eyed git .
ZIAT: NO ! Is good ! Me good shit .
MAX: No ! You big shit !
ZIAT: Yeah ! Efe big shit .
MAX: You asshole ! Then hurries after it , calling its name
BILLY: What is it with you man , what the hell is it ?
ZIAT: Cat , ah ! Ayip !
BILLY: You 're ayip !
ZIAT: Look , you do n't fuck with me , I do n't fuck with you , right ?
BILLY: But you fuck with me . You fuck with me all the time . You make crummy tea . You rip us off on the hash .
ZIAT: I make special tea for you , Hiyes , okay ? We 've to live like brothers . We have to be in here together .
BILLY: Oh shove it , Ziat for all the money you have , you have nothing !
ZIAT: You 'Merican . You do n't know . BILLY watches , repulsed and fascinated .
BILLY: Know what ?
ZIAT: Was.. seven years old . I was on street in Suk . Buy . Sell . No family to take care . I learn .
BILLY: Learn what ? ZIAT shrugs . He thinks BILLY is an idiot .
ZIAT: Dog eat dog , Hi-yes . You fuck othe man before he fuck you . And you must fuck last .
BILLY: That 's a great philosophy .
ZIAT: You 'Merican . You do n't know .
MAX: Here Hikmet ! Come down here boy ! Hikmet RAFTER Nothing . Max gives up .
YESIL: The new American Ambassador here is following your case very closely . He says there is progress . But there is another route that is quite possible For the proper amount of money it is possible I can convince certain officials to lose track of your papers before the High Court in Ankara confirms the sentence of the Lower Court in Istanbul You would not exist ; and you could be in Greece by the time the Turkish courts discovered a stupid clerical mistakeBut I have to act before the official sentence is handed down , and for that I must pay certain officials in advance
SUSAN'S VOICE: My dearest Billy . I know it is long and it is hard for you , but your family and I are thinking about you all the time . I am trying hard to make enough money nights to come and see you . Your fathe says that lawyer Yesil wants anothe $ 2000 . I know you distrust him more and more , but your fathe wants to do everything he can , and he is borrowing all he can on the mortgage of the house . Money seems to be the only way out of there . Except of course the other way
BELL: The blueprints !
MAX: To what ?
BELL: The prison , man . There was this German cat an architect in the hospital . He was helping the Turks uild some shit round the place . I laid some bread on him and he let me copy them .
MAX: Too bad you did n't have a machine .
BELL: There 's two ways out I figger - over the roof , but that 's only one person , maybe two . The other way is Under .
BILLY: Tunnel ?
BELL: It 's already built ! There 's a asement substructure where they used to keep weapons and stuff , ut beneath that there 's these old catacombs that the Christians built 'bout a thousand fucking years ago to bury their dead . We 're sitting ight on top of it here .
MAX: Got ta be here someplace . Thought I heard a couple of dead Christians singing down there .
BELL: Stop shitting me , man !
BILLY: But how would you get into the shaft , Jimmy ?
MAX: I suppose you knock three times and ask for St. Peter .
BELL: Hey ! I 'm getting this togethe man and I do n't need no fucking Gastro-head along on this trip ! We go through the wall .
BILLY: We go through the wall ?
MAX: We go through the wall .
BELL: The Kraut was right ! I checked it out - there 's no reinforced steel in those bath walls . They 're eal soft from underground seepage
MAX: And what do you do when you in the catacombs ?
BELL: The catacoombs ? Whaddya want , a door ? There 's miles of em like a sewer system but they got to come up someplace in Istanbul . Max is fed up with it now , no longer joking .
MAX: You got ta be fucking crazy ! You got stabbed in the ass once too much , sweetheart , cause you 're gon na end up in Section 13 , that 's what - not the 'catacombs .
BILLY: Section 13 ?
MAX: Yeah , for the criminally insane . I was there once for two weeks and it ai n't an illusion . It 's awful . Namidou runs it like a death camp , that 's where he spends most of his time
BILLY: Where is it ?
MAX: I don ' t know . It 's someplace down in there . ..deep.. A big doora wheel .
BELL: Hey , you know what 's gon na get us out of here ? It 's not a map , Max . It 's our balls . You know what I mean I got ta get laid man , I do n't know 'bout you guys , but if I do n't get it on soon , I 'm I 'm not gon na make it .
MAX: Shit .
BELL: Billy ?
BILLY: The roof sounds better to me than digging through a wall . Ziat 's ound there all the time . But the oof .
BELL: Well fuck it ! Choose your own death , babe , I 'm taking the roof out of here ! Bell leaves
BILLY'S VOICE: Dear Susan . Poor Jimmy was caught and beaten so badly he got a severe hernia and lost a testicle . He 's een in the hospital for months having operations..
BILLY VOICE: In comparison my problems seem very small . But two and a half years have now gone by , and in their own fashion , the Turks are slowly draining my life away
BILLY'S VOICE: I have problems with my stomach and my leg muscles feel very weak . My gums seem to be shrinking and they sometimes bleed when I massage them They 've pulled five of my teeth
BILLY VOICE: even my dreams do n't seem to work any more . Because the outside does n't seem real any more . It 's not even a fantasybecause there is no fantasy .
BILLY'S VOICE: Even masturbation has become boring . It teaches you , like the rest of prison life , to seal up you emotions , and this is the greatest danger , this is what makes so many of the men change into something monstrous
BILLY VOICE: It is Erich who has taught me how it is to be conscious , to channel and direct my energy . He has convinced me to stop smoking hashish , he is the calmest man I have ever known . If you do n't control your energy in here if can low you apart like with Bell . And you ca n't waste it either . You have to weigh up every one of you actions - for and against . Too little sex , too much sex eithe will throw you off balance
BILLY: A prison a monastery a cloister a cave , Prison monastery cloister cave , Prison monastery cloister cave , Prison monastery cloister cave , Prison monastery cloister
BILLY'S VOICE: Dear Susan . Erich has been transferred to a prison back in Sweden . He has profoundly affected my life and though I am lonely without him I am calmer than ever
BELL: Asina Covaciml . He is noticeably pale and weaker than before .
BILLY'S VOICE: Poor Jimmy
BILLY VOICE: Though his health is bad he still wo n't give up GUARD approaching with a slip in hand .
BILLY'S VOICE: He still talks of escape .
BILLY: What 's wrong ?
DAVIS: Sit down a moment , Billy . I 'm afraid I have some bad news fo you . BILLY sits , tense .
BILLY: Something happen to Dad ? Mom ? DAVIS swallows hard , not to say it
DAVIS: No It looks like your going to have a new court .
BILLY: What do you mean ?
DAVIS: The Prosecutor objected to you sentence for possession ; he wanted a smuggling conviction and the High Court in Ankara reviewed it .
BILLY: And ?
DAVIS: We 've been notified that they ejected the sentence Billy 's face drains of all expression .
BILLY: What do you mean LIFE FOR FOR WHAT !
DAVIS: Billy ! Please !
TRANSLATOR: Would Your honor like me to translate ?
JUDGE: That wo n't be necessary
TURK: We 're playing the sas .
BELL: Omina koyden your sas ! THE TWO TURKS tense , the mood changing .
BILLY: Cut it ! No more fights . BELL looks .
BILLY'S VOICE: Dear Susan . It 's taken me a long time to find out that it 's got to stop somewhere . I 've learned painfully not to trust the Turks , the courts , the lawyers , the Consul , the United States Government , and not even my loving parents . There is only one way out of here.. The Midnight Express .
MAX: We 're undermining the other stones !
BELL: We got ta take a chance and do that one next - Then pull out this one - Just jiggle it , scratch it out , loose nit up , it 's soft real soft !
BILLY: It 's there !
BELL: What ?
BILLY: Listen !
BELL: I told you , I told you you cock- suckers ! You did n't believe me .
MAX: Fuck me ! You beautiful mother , you !
BILLY: Hey , Ziat , hurry up with the tea will ay !
ZIAT: Work , work , work , that 's all do
BILLY: I do n't hear you bitch about the money .
BELL: Want me to take over ?
BILLY: You want to split your hernia again ?
MAX: Get off our tits !
BELL: Let 's go !
BILLY: No . No time . Put 'em back . MAX groans to himself .
MAX: Yeah .
BELL: Haps , railroad , bus timetables ?
MAX: Everything .
BILLY: Okay . Let 's do it .
MAX: Yeah !
BILLY: Jimmy ?
BELL: What ?
BILLY: How 's your hernia ?
BELL: Do n't make me laugh .
MAX: Jesus ! BILLY looking up .
BILLY: Anybody bitten ?
BELL: Nah , just covered with batshit !
BILLY: They went out over there must be some kind of exit . Heads in that direction .
BELL: The fuck are we ? BILLY comes into view , equally frustrated .
BILLY: What time is it ?
MAX: Two thirty .
BILLY: Shit ! Shit ! Shit !
MAX: It 's a dead end . The Turks musta ' sealed it up .
BELL: What the fuck we gon na do ?
BILLY: We go back .
MAX: What ? You got ta be joking .
BILLY: We go back , seal it up again , and come in tomorrow night - every night 'till we get out of here . There 's got ta be a way . Those bats got out someplace . Now let 's go . Doubletime !
MAX: You got ta have a lot of balls fo this
BELL: Count me out . Who ever heard of anybody sneaking ack into a fucking jail ? MAX overhearing it .

BILLY: We 'll tell him we were checking out our escape route . We wanted to be completely sure before we tried it .

BILLY: Yeah .
MAX: I got some acid man . Maybe we can drop some on the guards huh ? In their tea or something .
BILLY: Then we 're outside the kogus . Then what ?
MAX: What ?
BILLY: After we 're outside the kogus ?
MAX: Oh we we
BILLY: Max Your BILLY shirt 's on fire
MAX: Oh shit ! Oh Christ !
BILLY: What ?

BILLY: Whose ?
MAX: ZIAT What do I got to lose huh ! What do I got to lose . And I 'd eally enjoy it . Lurches against the bunk .
BILLY: Max , sit down . You 're in no shape to kill anybody .
MAX: I want to cut his throat .

HAMIDOU: Where did you get this hash ? Raises his arm again .
ZIAT: From Max . Point at MAX who stiffens , eyes like cracked eggs .
MAX: You got to be kidding . HAMIDOU peers at MAX , advances .
HAMIDOU: What 's happening with this hash ? Indicates the matchbox in his hand .

2ND SOLDIER: Mou fainetai san Toupkika BILLY with dimming strength .
FARMER: MaliseeEllada !
GIL: If I 'd have stayed the first time I came by now I 'd be a Parisian .
JOHN: There are our sight-seers .
INEZ: If I never see another charming oulevard or bistro -
GIL: What a town .
HELEN: To visit .
GIL: I could easily see myself as a Parisien - strolling the Left Bank - a baguette under my arm - finishing my novel - at a table at the Cafe Flore . A Moveable Feast - Hemingway called it .
HELEN: In this traffic nothing moves .
GIL: Well yes it was different then .
JOHN: Can we continue this talk of moveable feasts at Grand Vefou ecause I 'm starved .
GIL: Americans eat dinner so early .
JOHN: And I 'm proud of it .
HELEN: A toast to John 's new business venture here .
JOHN: Well I 'll be perfectly frank - I 'm excited over this corporate merge etween our people and the French company but otherwise I 'm not a big Francophile .
HELEN: John hates their politics .
JOHN: They 've certainly been no friend to the united States .
GIL: You ca n't say they were n't right in not backing Bush 's moronic war in Iraq .
INEZ: Please let 's not get into that discussion yet again ?
GIL: There 's nothing wrong with you father and I disagreeing . That 's what democracy is . Your fathe defends the right wing of the Republican party and I happen to think they represent sub-mental Neanderthals . But we respect each other 's views - am I right ?
HELEN: Can we discuss the wedding plans ? Your father 's used his good offices with the opera to get some of the singers to attend and sing . I thought Puccini would be nice .
INEZ: Is n't that great Gil ?
GIL: Just no Wagner . When she walks down the aisle not The Ride of the Valkyries . Hey look , I just want to say that I am politically ipartisan in that , in my view , to e a politician of any party one must of necessity be a whore .
INEZ: Gil .
PAUL: Inez .
INEZ: Paul ! Carol- Paul and Carol Bates - Mom , Dad , you know Gil - you did n't mention you 'd be here .
CAROL: It was sudden . Paul got invited to lecture at the Sorbonne .
INEZ: Oh - how terrific . Dad 's here on usiness and we free-loaded along .
PAUL: It 's great . We can spend some time together .
GIL: Do n't we have a lot of commitments ?
INEZ: What ?
CAROL: What are you doing tomorrow ? We 're driving to Versailles .
INEZ: I 'm dying to see Versailles .
GIL: Do n't we have something tomorrow ? We were going to have lunch at the Brasserie Lipp . My old professo once actually saw James Joyce there . He said Joyce was eating sauerkraut and frankfurters .
INEZ: Is that the end of the story ?
GIL: It is actually -
INEZ: We 'd love to go with you guys . Versailles is beautiful - I have to see it Gil - it 's perfect for you with your obsession with `` les temps perdus '' и
GIL: Yes - but -
PAUL: It 's such a lovely treat running into you here . A demain .
INEZ: I hope you 're not going to be as anti-social tomorrow when we go to Versailles .
GIL: How was I anti-social ?
INEZ: It was so clear you did n't want to go .
GIL: Well they 're your friends and I ca n't say I 'm as taken with him as you are .
INEZ: He 's brilliant . I used to have such a crush on him at college . And Carol 's very bright .
GIL: I find him a pseudo-intellectual .
INEZ: I hardly think the Sorbo nne would have him lecturing if he 's a pseudo- intellectual . You should give him your novel to read . I 'm sure he 'd e able to critique your writing and show you why you 're having so much trouble .
GIL: I 'm having trouble because I 'm a Hollywood hack who never gave actual literature a real shot .
INEZ: Gil , promise me if this book does n't come off you 'll give up eating your brains out and get ack to what you do best .
PAUL: I believe Louis moved his court here in about 1682 - originally this was all swamp land - in fact , if I 'm not mistaken , in old French the word Versailles means something like `` terrain where the weeds have een pulled '' . The main structure is French classical style at its height - the work , I believe of Louis Le Vau , I think Mansart and Charles LeBrun I believe иии
INEZ: I think I could get used to a summer home like this .
PAUL: Me too except , remember , in those days they only had baths and I 'm definitely a shower man .
CAROL: Where are you two planning to live after the wedding ?
INEZ: We 're looking in Malibu . We love where you live .
GIL: I keep trying to talk her into a little attic with a skylight in Paris -
CAROL: La Boheme .
PAUL: All that 's missing is tuberculosis .
INEZ: He does n't even know if he can write a novel . So far your track ecord 's - you know - whereas , everyone likes your movies -
GIL: Yes movie scripts are easier .
INEZ: Tell them about the lead characte in the book you 're working on .
GIL: I do n't like to discuss my work .
INEZ: Not the plot , just the lead character . He works in a nostalgia shop .
CAROL: What 's a nostalgia shop ?
PAUL: Not one of those stores that sells Shirley Temple dolls and old adios ? I never know who buys that stuff - who 'd want it .
INEZ: People who live in the past . Who think their lives would have been happier if they lived in an earlie time .
PAUL: And just what era would you have preferred to live in , Minive Cheevy ?
INEZ: Paris in the twenties - in the rain - when the rain was n't acid rain .
PAUL: I see . And no global warming , no TV or suicide bombing , nuclea weapons , drug cartels .
CAROL: The usual menu of cliched horro stories .
PAUL: Nostalgia is denial . Denial of the painful present .
INEZ: He 's a romantic . Gil would be just fine living in a perpetual state of denial .
PAUL: The name for this fallacy is called , Golden Age thinking .
INEZ: Touche .
PAUL: The erroneous notion that a different time period was bette than the one , one 's living in . It 's a flaw in the romantic imagination of those who find coping with the present too difficult .
HELEN: It 's definitely the nicest ring we 've seen .
INEZ: I love a diamond wedding band . The way it sparkled they 'll see it in the last row when he puts it on my finger .
HELEN: This is going to be such an event , Inez . I only wish -
INEZ: I do n't want to keep going over it , Mom .
HELEN: Look , he 's your choice . What can I say ?
INEZ: Gil 's smart and successful .
HELEN: And yet he talks of g1.v1.ng it up and moving here . That frightens me .
INEZ: The world is full of people who dream of writing the great American novel . Let me handle him .
HELEN: You 're father thinks you 're comfortable with Gil because you can control him .
INEZ: He likes to please me - is that so terrible ? Oh gosh - I have to go - Paul arranged a private tour of the Rodin Museum .
GUIDE: This is , of course , Rodin 's most famous statue . A cast of this work was placed next to his tomb . Rodin wished for it to serve as his headstone and epitaph .
PAUL: That would be in Meudon . He died of the flu if I 'm not mistaken - 1917 I believe .
GUIDE: Exactly correct . You know your art history , monsieur . The design -
PAUL: The Thinker is so powerful because he thinks not just with his brain - he thinks with every limb and muscle - you feel the concentration .
INEZ: He 's so knowledgeable , is n't he ?
PAUL: So much of Rodin 's work was influenced by his wife , Camille .
GUIDE: Yes , she was an influence - though Camille was not the wife but his mistress .
PAUL: Camille ? No .
GUIDE: Yes . Rose was the wife .
PAUL: He never married Rose .
GUIDE: Yes , in the last year of thei lives .
PAUL: I think you 're mistaken .
CAROL: Are you arguing with the guide ?
PAUL: am .
GUIDE: Ah , non , non , je suis certaine .
GIL: I 'm afraid she 's right . I just ead the recent two volume iography of Rodin - Rose was definitely the wife , Camille the mistress .
PAUL: You read that ? Where did you read that ?
GIL: I did - no question . Camille- Rose .
INEZ: Do n't forget , Dad invited you to join us at a wine tasting tonight .
CAROL: It 'll be so fun . Paul 's an expert on French wines .
INEZ: When did you read the biography of Rodin ?
GIL: Me ? Why would I read a biography of Rodin ?
INEZ: I ca n't tell the difference . They 're both delicious .
JOHN: Take it easy Inez . Those little sips add up .
HELEN: You should talk , John - especially for someone who once advocated the oycott of french wines .
JOHN: I 'll always take a California wine ut the Napa Valley is six thousand miles away . They laugh and drink .
INEZ: Which do you prefer ?
GIL: To me they 're all great . What the hell do I know ?
INEZ: I do n't think I 've ever seen you cheeks so red .
GIL: Pheromones , it 's your pheromones .
PAUL: Ah yes - sex and alcohol - It fuels the desire but kills the performance - according to the Bard .
CAROL: Have you tasted the '61 ? It 's divine - though Paul found it - what ?
PAUL: Slightly more tannic than the '59 . I prefer a smoky feeling to a fruity feeling , do n't you agree ?
GIL: You will admit she 's a sexy woman .
PAUL: This I have known for many years . You 're a very lucky man .
GIL: To the little green Heinz pickle pin .
PAUL: Carol and I are going to go dancing - we heard of a great place . Interested ?
INEZ: Sure .
GIL: I do n't want to be a party poope ut I just want fresh air .
INEZ: Oh come on - although if you 're just going to sit there and obsess over where the fire exits are .
CAROL: If Gil does n't want to go , I 'll share Paul with you . I 'm very democratic . And he 's a marvelous dancer .
GIL: If it 's okay with you , I 'd really just like a little walk and go to ed . We can do it another night .
INEZ: Well I can go , right ?
GIL: You go ?
INEZ: I 'm not tired and I 'm dying to dance . I 'll just meet you back at the hotel .
PAUL: I 'll take good care of her .
GIL: I - I - guess so иии
INEZ: Is n't it great we 're all on holiday at the same time .
CAROL: Back home we just joined a marvelous tennis club and Paul says you play . Does Gil ?
INEZ: I ca n't introduce him to tennis - Daddy 's having the damndest time pressuring him to learn golf .
PAUL: Is he a good writer ? Have you read his prose ?
INEZ: He wo n't let anybody -
PAUL: If he wants I 'd be glad to go ove his novel and critique it for him .
INEZ: That 's what he needs , to have it ead by someone who really knows and would n't pull any punches . The problem is - when it comes to his writing he has no respect fo anyone 's opinion .
DOUG: Come on - get in .
GIL: Huh ?
DENISE: Let 's go , we 're late .
GIL: You have the wrong person .
DENISE: Mais non , pas de tout - allez montez -
GIL: Look , I 'm a little drunk -
DOUG: C'mon - for god 's sake - we ca n't sit here all night .
GIL: This is a great old peugeot . I have a friend in Beverly Hills who has the same one - he collects -
DENISE: Let 's go . We have so many parties to go to .
GIL: What parties ?
DENISE: Here - you need some champagne - Gil gets in . They shut door and pull off .
GIL: Where are we going ?
PHIL: 36 rue de and lets hurry .
GIL: It 's not fair - my head is swimming from wine .
DENISE: Prenez du champagne - detendez-vous un peu .
GIL: I do like champagne .
DENISE: The night is young - drink up , drink up , drink up .
GIL: I 'm drinking up . He drinks , befuddled .
ZELDA: You look lost .
GIL: You 're American .
ZELDA: If you count Alabama as America which I do . I miss the bathtu gin . What do you do ?
GIL: Oh I - I 'm a writer .
ZELDA: What do you write ?
GIL: Right now I 'm working on a novel .
ZELDA: Oh yes ? I 'm Zelda by the way . Oh Scott - Scott come over here . Here 's a writer from , where ?
GIL: California .
SCOTT: Scott Fitzgerald , and who are you old sport ?
GIL: I 'm Gil Pen - oh you two have the same names as -
SCOTT: As what ?
GIL: Scott Fitzgerald and -
SCOTT: Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald . The Fitzgeralds . Is n't she beautiful ?
GIL: Yes - its a coincidence . I mean it is a funny coincidence .
ZELDA: You have a glazed look in your eye . Stunned , stupefied , anesthetized , lobotomized -
GIL: I - I - I keep thinking that man at the piano - believe it or not I ecognize his face from some old sheet music - what am I talking about here ?
ZELDA: I know if I put my mind to it I could be one of the great writers of musical lyrics not that I can write melodies - and I try - and then I hear the songs he writes and I realize I 'll never write a great lyric and that my talent really lies in drinking .
GIL: Yes but - he did n't write that song - did he ? That 's not possible -
SCOTT: What kind of books do you write ?
GIL: I - I - I - I 'm - I 'm working on a - exactly where am I ?
SCOTT: I 'm sorry - Do n't you know the host ? Some friends have gotten together a little party for Jean Cocteau .
GIL: Hey lady , are you kidding me ?
ZELDA: I know what you 're thinking - this is boring - I agree - I 'm ready to move on - let 's do Bricktop 's , Scott , I 'm bored , he 's bored , we 're all bored .
SCOTT: Whatever you say , sweetheart . See if Cole and Linda want to come with . Coming ? Gil stares open mouthed .
ZELDA: Une bouteille de bourbon .
SCOTT: Greetings and salutations . You 'll forgive me - I 've been mixing grain and grappa иии This is Gil - Gil ? Yes , Gil .
GIL: Gil Pender .
HEMINGWAY: Hemingway .
GIL: Hemingway ? Hey , is this some kind of a -
HEMINGWAY: You liked my book ?
GIL: Liked - I loved - everything you wrote -
HEMINGWAY: Yes it was a good book because it was an honest book and that 's what war does to men and there 's nothing fine and noble about dying in the mud unless you die gracefully and then it 's not only noble but brave .
GIL: Ernest Hemingway - this is - I -
HEMINGWAY: Say hello to Pender - the bulls in the ring do n't frighten Belmonte - he 's killed many brave ones . Fine ave bulls .
GIL: I 'm sure - good bulls , true ulls иии
HEMINGWAY: Why are you smiling ?
SCOTT: In New York you ca n't buy this - it can only be made in a bathtub - and some of the bathtub mixtures are damn good - Is n't that so ? She prefers he hootch from a homemade still - more kick .
ZELDA: Did you read my story ? What did you think ?
HEMINGWAY: It began well - really well - then it became weak .
ZELDA: I might 've known you 'd hate it .
SCOTT: Darling you 're too sensitive .
ZELDA: You liked the story but he hates me .
HEMINGWAY: There was some fine writing but it was not fulfilled .
SCOTT: Please old sport - you make matters extremely difficult .
ZELDA: I 'm jumpy - suddenly I do n't like the atmosphere here anymore . Where are you going ?
JUAN BELMONTE: Para reunirse con amigos en el St. Germain
ZELDA: He 's going to St. Germain . I 'm going with him .
SCOTT: Zelda -
ZELDA: If you 're going to stay and drink with him I 'm going with the toreador .
SCOTT: Get her back at a reasonable time . They go .
HEMINGWAY: She 'll drive you crazy , this woman .
SCOTT: She 's exciting - and she has talent .
HEMINGWAY: This month it 's writing , last month it was something else . You 're a writer - you need time to write - not all this playing around - she 's wasting you - because she 's really a competitor - do n't you agree ?
GIL: Me ? I just met -
HEMINGWAY: Speak up for Christ 's sake . I 'm asking you if you think my friend is making a tragic mistake .
GIL: Actually I do n't know the Fitzgeralds that well -
HEMINGWAY: You 're a writer - you make observations - you were with them all night .
SCOTT: Can we not discuss my personal life in public ?
HEMINGWAY: She has him on yachts , at parties , jumping into swimming pools you 're wasting your talent .
SCOTT: You do n't understand her .
HEMINGWAY: She 's jealous of his gift and it 's a damn fine gift . It 's rare . You like his work ? You can speak freely .
SCOTT: Stop it .
HEMINGWAY: You like Mark Twain ?
GIL: I do - very much .
SCOTT: I 'm going to find Zelda . I do n't like the thought of her with the Spaniard .
HEMINGWAY: He 's a fine writer , Fitzgerald . You box ?
GIL: No .
HEMINGWAY: What are you writing ?
GIL: A novel .
HEMINGWAY: About what ?
GIL: A man who works in a nostalgia shop .
HEMINGWAY: What the hell 's a nostalgia shop ?
GIL: Where they sell old things - memorabilia . Does that sound terrible to you ?
HEMINGWAY: No subject is terrible if the story is true . If the prose is clean and honest and if it affirms courage and grace under pressure .
GIL: Would you do me the biggest favo in the world - I ca n't even ask иии
HEMINGWAY: What ?
GIL: Would you read it ?
HEMINGWAY: Your novel ?
GIL: It 's only about four hundred pages - if you could just give me you opinion .
HEMINGWAY: My opinion is I hate it .
GIL: You do ?
HEMINGWAY: If it 's bad I 'll hate it because I hate bad writing and if it 's good I 'll be envious and hate it all the more . You do n't want the opinion of another writer .
GIL: But there 's no one I really trust to evaluate it -
HEMINGWAY: Writers are competitive .
GIL: I could never compete with you -
HEMINGWAY: You 're too self-effacing - it 's not manly . If you 're a writer , declare yourself the best writer - but you 're not the best as long as I 'm around . Unless you want to put the gloves on and settle it .
GIL: No - no - that 's okay -
HEMINGWAY: I wo n't read your novel but I 'll tell you what I 'll do .
GIL: Yes ?
HEMINGWAY: I 'll bring it over to Gertrude Stein . She 's the only one I trust to read my work . No one discovers new talent like Gert - whether it 's poetry , painting , music - She 'll tell you if you have a book or not .
GIL: You could have Gertrude Stein read my novel ?
HEMINGWAY: Give it to me .
GIL: I have to get it . It 's at the hotel .
HEMINGWAY: She gets back from Spain tomorrow .
GIL: I 'm so thrilled - my heart is eating . I 'll go home and get it - I 'll give it to you - I ca n't tell you what this means to me . To have Gertrude Stein read my novel - thank you , thank you - He exits the place .
INEZ: Lucky you did n't go last night . You 'd have hated the music and the crowd - but I had fun .
GIL: Uh-huh .
INEZ: What are you thinking ? You seem in a daze .
GIL: If I told you I was with Ernest Hemingway and Scott Fitzgerald last night , what would you say ?
INEZ: Is that what you were dreaming about ? Your literary idols .
GIL: But if I was n't dreaming -
INEZ: What does that mean ?
GIL: If I told you I spent time with Hemingway and Fitzgerald and Cole Porter -
INEZ: I 'd be thinking brain tumor .
GIL: Can I tell you Zelda Fitzgerald is exactly as we 've come to know he from articles and books - she 's mercurial and moody and she does not get along with Hemingway - and Scott knows Hemingway 's right about it but you can see how conflicted he is because he loves her -
INEZ: Right , right - er where 's my cold cream - we should knock off the idle chatter because we 're going to e late .
GIL: Actually I wanted to stay and work on my novel - it needs a little polishing .
INEZ: You can work on it later . And we can use Mom 's decorator 's discount .
HELEN: Come look at this Inez - would n't this be charming for a Malibu beach house ?
OWNER: Dix-huit mille .
HELEN: It 's a steal at eighteen thousand dollars .
GIL: Eighteen thousand dollars ?
HELEN: Oh wait , that 's Euros so it 's more -
INEZ: That 's over twenty thousand dollars , Mom .
HELEN: Yes but it 's very hard to find anything like this at home .
INEZ: She 's right , Gil .
GIL: Yes but we have n't even found a house yet and I 'm trying to keep expenses down so I can turn down jobs .
HELEN: You get what you pay for . Cheap is cheap .
GIL: I know you love Malibu but -
INEZ: Did you ever make love in a chaise like this ? Imagine the possibilities .
GIL: Er - of course when you think of it that way it does help amortize the eighteen grand .
HELEN: And do n't forget - we 're taking you to dinner tonight at .
INEZ: Great .
GIL: And after I have a terrific surprise for you .
INEZ: What ? I 'm not big on surprises .
GIL: You will be . Believe me .
HELEN: Look at these marvelous Blackamoors . I see them in you living room . CUT TO l
INEZ: Where are you taking me ? You made me rush through dinner . Dad was n't finished with his profiteroles .
GIL: You 're going on one of the most amazing adventures of your life .
INEZ: Where ? And why are you carrying around your manuscript .
GIL: You 'll see - you 'll see - and you jaw will drop .
INEZ: I do n't know what it is you 're carrying on about but this is not my idea of an amazing adventure . I 'm exhausted from the gym and the massage .
GIL: Inez .
INEZ: Look - you want to walk the streets and `` drink in Paris by night '' - go ahead . I 'm in the middle of a great book Carol lent me and if I 'm asleep when you get in , do n't wake me .
GIL: What am I doing wrong ? Unless she 's right and I need to see a neurologist . Left the wine tasting - a little high yes - right here . The clock begins to chime midnight .
HEMINGWAY: The assignment was to take the hill . There were four of us .
GIL: Were n't you scared ?
HEMINGWAY: Of what ?
GIL: Getting killed .
HEMINGWAY: You 'll never write well if you fea dying . Do you ?
GIL: It 's my biggest fear .
HEMINGWAY: But it 's something all men before you have done and all men will do .
GIL: Yes but -
HEMINGWAY: Have you ever made love to a truly great woman ?
GIL: My fiance is very sexy .
HEMINGWAY: And when you make love to her you feel true and beautiful passion and you at least for that moment lose your fear of death .
GIL: I do n't know about that -
HEMINGWAY: I believe that love that 's true and eal creates a respite from death . All cowardice comes from not loving or not loving well which is the same thing and when the man who is ave and true looks death squarely in the face like some rhino hunters I know or Belmonte who is truly ave , it is because they love with sufficient passion to push death out of their minds till it returns as it does to all men and then you must make really good love again . Think about it .
STEIN: I 'm glad you 're here . You can help decide which of us is right and which of us is wrong .
GIL: Pender .
STEIN: Pablo Picasso .
PABLO: Vous ne le comprenez pas correctment . Vous ne connaissez pas Adriana mais c'est tout ce qui la represente .
STEIN: No tu n ' a pas raison . Look how he 's done her - dripping with sexual innuendo . Carnal to the point of smoldering and yes she 's eautiful but it 's a subtle beauty - an implied sensuality . What is your first impression of Adriana ?
GIL: иииии Exceptionally lovely .
STEIN: Belle , mais plus subtil plus implicite , Pablo .
HEMINGWAY: You 're right Gertrude - of course you can see why he 's lost his objectivity .
STEIN: You 've made a creation of Place Pigalle , a whore with volcanic appetites .
PABLO: Mais c'est comme elle est , si vous la connaissez .
STEIN: Yes - avec vous en prive - because she 's your lover - but we do n't know her that way - so you make a petit bourgeoise judgment and turn her into an object of pleasure .
PABLO: Je ne suis pas d'accord .
STEIN: And what about this book of yours I 've been hearing about ? Have you read it ?
HEMINGWAY: No , this I leave to you . You 've always been the best judge of my work .
STEIN: `` Out of the Past was the name of the store and its products consisted of memories . What was prosaic and even vulgar to one generation had been transmuted by the mere passing of years to a status at once magical and also camp. ``
ADRIANA: I love it . I 'm already - hooked ? Hooked .
STEIN: I 'll start it tonight . But first we have something to talk about .
GIL: Did my opening lines really get to you that strongly ?
ADRIANA: The past has always had a great charisma for me .
GIL: Me too . I was born too late .
ADRIANA: Oui , exactement . For me Belle Epoque Paris would have been perfect . The whole sensibility , the street lamps , the kiosks - the horse and carriages . And Maxims - then .
GIL: You speak very good English .
ADRIANA: No , not really .
GIL: Yes - and how long have you been dating Picasso ? My god , did I say that ?
ADRIANA: Pardon .
GIL: Oh - I - no , I did n't mean anything - you know - to pry иии born in Paris ?
ADRIANA: I was born in Bordeaux - I moved here to study fashion and - you do n't want to hear this -
GIL: No , I do .
ADRIANA: I came here - to study with Coco Chanel - and I fell in love with Paris and also a very dark eyed , haunted , Jewish-Italian painter - and I knew Amedeo had another woman ut still I could n't resist moving into his apartment when he asked and it was a beautiful six months .
GIL: Not Modigliani ? Was it Modigliani ? You lived with Modigliani ?
ADRIANA: You asked me so I 'm telling you my sad story . With Braque also there was another woman - many - and now with Pablo - I mean Pablo is married but every day it 's on again , off again - I do n't know how any woman can stay with him - he 's so difficult .
GIL: My god you are a whole different level of art groupie .
ADRIANA: Pardon .
GIL: Nothing - I 'm -
ADRIANA: But tell me about yourself . Have you come to Paris to write because these days so many Americans feel the need to move here . Is n't Hemingway attractive ? I love his writing .
GIL: Actually I 'm visiting .
ADRIANA: Oh you must stay here . It 's a wonderful city for artists and writers .
GIL: Believe me , I want to but it 's not that simple .
ADRIANA: And I did fall madly in love with the start of your book so I want to hear the rest of it . Hemingway and Stein return .
HEMINGWAY: Come , let 's all go for a drink up at Montmartre .
STEIN: We 'll discuss your book as soon as I finish it . Where can I reach you ?
GIL: Oh that 's okay - I 'll drop by - it 'll be easier for you - if that 's okay .
STEIN: We run an open house .
ADRIANA: You sure you wo n't come ?
GIL: I only wish I could but I ca n't - ut hopefully I 'll see you again -
ADRIANA: That would be nice .
HEMINGWAY: One of these days I plan to steal you away from this genius who 's great but no Miro .
GIL: I 'm Gil Pender - I was with Hemingway and Picasso - Pablo Picasso - Ernest Hemingway - I 'm Gil Pender from Pasadena - the Cu Scouts - I failed freshman English - I 'm Gil Pender and my novel is with Gertrude Stein - I once worked at The House of Pies . I 'm little Gil Pender . And that girl was so lovely .
HELEN: It 's a shame you two did n't come to the movies last night . We saw a wonderfully funny American film . I forget the name .
GIL: Wonderful but forgettable . I 've seen that picture .
HELEN: I know it was moronic and infantile and lacking any wit o elievability but John and I laughed in spite of ourselves .
INEZ: What time did you get in ? I was dead asleep .
GIL: Not late . I find these midnight strolls are very good for me creatively - without the distractions of the day - I 'll probably take another long walk tonight .
INEZ: We 'll see . Oh how about this ?
HELEN: Oh look at these wonderful glass figures .
GABRIELLE: C'est jolie , no .
GIL: Yes - very beautiful .
GABRIELLE: Cole Porter . Vous aimez - you like Cole Porter ?
GIL: Love his music - we 're very close - Cole , Linda and I . She gives him a look .
GABRIELLE: Very pretty and tres amusant . He listens . Inez comes over .
INEZ: Gil - Gil - Gil ?
GIL: Huh ?
INEZ: We should go . We 're meeting Paul and Carol for a private showing at the museum .
GIL: With the same sharp guide ?
INEZ: It 's a different museum and we do n't need a guide . Paul 's an expert on Monet .
PAUL: The juxtaposition of color is amazing . This man was the real father of abstract expressionism . I take that back , maybe Turner .
INEZ: I prefer Monet . I mean I love Turner but this is overwhelming .
PAUL: If I 'm not mistaken it took him two years to complete this . And he worked out at Giverny - where he frequently -
GIL: They say Monet used to -
INEZ: Shhh . I want to hear what Paul 's saying .
PAUL: He was frequently visited by Caillebotte - an artist I personally feel was underrated .
CAROL: I find Monet almost too pretty - like Renoir - sometimes it 's cloying .
PAUL: Ah - now here 's a superb Picasso .
GIL: Er - I have to differ with you on this one .
PAUL: Really ?
INEZ: Gil pay attention and you 'll learn something .
GIL: If I 'm not mistaken this was a failed attempt to capture a young French girl named Adriana - from Bordeaux - if my art history serves me - came to Paris to study costume design for the theatre . Believe she had a brief affair with Modigliani - then Braque - that 's where Pablo met her - er Picasso . You 'd never know it from this portrait but she 's quite subtly eautiful .
INEZ: What have you been smoking ?
GIL: And I 'd hardly call the picture superb . It 's more of a petit ourgeoise statement of how Pablo er Picasso sees her , saw her - he 's distracted by the fact she was a volcano in the sack .
JOHN: Too rich for me .
HELEN: Where did Gil run off to ?
INEZ: Work - he likes to walk around Paris - the way the city is all lit up at night allegedly inspires him - It 's okay . Paul and I are going dancing .
HELEN: Where 's Carol ?
INEZ: In bed with a bad oyster . See you later . Thanks for dinne Dad . She exits .
JOHN: Where does Gil go every night ?
HELEN: You heard her . He walks and gets ideas .
JOHN: Uh-huh .
HELEN: You sound skeptical .
JOHN: I do n't know . I see what he earns ut sometimes I think he 's got a part missing . And I did n't like his remark about tea party Republicans . They 're decent people who want to take back the country - they 're not crypto-fascist , airhead zombies . Did you hear him say that ?
HELEN: Nevertheless I hardly think you idea of having him followed is practical .
JOHN: No ? I 'd like to know where he goes every night .
HELEN: Well we know one thing - he does n't go dancing .
ADRIANA: Hello again ? How nice you 're here .
GIL: I was at Gertrude Stein 's - she 's almost finished with my novel . And the Fitzgeralds invited me over and said you 'd be here - you and Pablo .
ADRIANA: Pablo 's home - we had a bit of a quarrel . But you looked like you were having fun dancing with Djuna Barnes .
GIL: That was Djuna Barnes ? No wonde she wanted to lead .
ADRIANA: Is n't this a wonderful place to throw a party - only the Fitzgeralds would think of it . Look - this is from the turn of the century . Everything was so eautiful then .
HEMINGWAY: Is n't this little Parisienne dream a movable feast ? Mark my words - I 'm going to steal you from that fugitive from Malaga one way or the other .
ADRIANA: Vous etes tous deux tres impressionants .
HEMINGWAY: But he has more courage . He faces death more directly and more often and if you chose him I would be disappointed but understand .
JUAN BELMONTE: Por desgracia para ambos ella ha elegido Pablo .
HEMINGWAY: Yes , she 's chosen Picasso - But Pablo thinks women are only to paint or sleep with .
ADRIANA: And you ?
HEMINGWAY: I think women are the equal of men in courage . Have you ever shot a charging lion ?
ADRIANA: Never .
HEMINGWAY: Have you ever hunted ? Have you ?
GIL: Only for bargains .
BELMONTE: venga - tomemos otra copa .
GIL: Would you like to maybe take a walk ?
ADRIANA: He 's moody and possessive . Artists are all like children .
GIL: I understand why they all want to paint you - you 're so damn interesting to look at in a lovely way .
ADRIANA: And you 're interesting in a lost way . Tell me more about your book .
GIL: I do n't want to talk about my book . I want to enjoy Paris by night .
ADRIANA: I keep forgetting , you 're only a tourist .
GIL: That 's putting it mildly .
ADRIANA: I can never decide whether Paris is more beautiful by day or by night .
GIL: There 's no book or painting , o symphony or sculpture that can ival a great city . All these streets and boulevards as a special art form .
ADRIANA: Vous avez l'ame d'un poete .
GIL: You 're very kind . I would not call my babbling poetic .
ADRIANA: See anything you like ?
GIL: I 'm ashamed to admit I 'm attracted to all of them . I like cheap-sexy . I know it 's shallow .
ADRIANA: When I was in Catholic school , one weekend , my roommate and I paid one of the girls of Pigalle to come teach us all her tricks .
GIL: Well , that 's the most interesting thing I 've ever heard in my life - I 'd like to think about that fo awhile .
ADRIANA: I love that the main character in your book sells memories .
GIL: Because he believes in his soul that progress is not automatically for the better .
ADRIANA: Often quite the opposite .
GIL: Say - is that who I think it is ?
ADRIANA: What is she doing here ? And why is she staring into the river .
ZELDA: Please leave me alone . I do n't want to live .
ADRIANA: What is it ? What 's going on ?
ZELDA: It all became clear to me tonight . Scott and that beautiful Countess - it was so obvious they were whispering about me and the more they drank the more he fell in love with her .
GIL: Scott loves only you . I can tell you with absolute certainty .
ZELDA: No , he 's tired of me .
GIL: No you 're wrong . I know .
ZELDA: How ? How ?
GIL: Trust me . I know .
ZELDA: But you just met us . How can you know anything . My skin hurts . I hate the way I look .
GIL: Take this .
ZELDA: What is this ?
GIL: A Valium - it 'll calm you down .
ADRIANA: You carry medicine ?
GIL: Only since Inez and I became engaged . I 've had these anxiety attacks - I 'm sure after the wedding they 'll subside .
ZELDA: I never heard of Valium . What is this ?
GIL: Er - it 's the pill of the future .
ZELDA: But pills wear off - and then it all comes back . No , I wo n't kill myself . I 'll write and I 'll write more passionately than Scott . I 'll work harder .
ADRIANA: He loves you . He 's not with that woman . She 's already on her way ack to Rome .
GIL: I 'll try and score some more fo you . And I have some Xanax at the hotel - it 's another one you 'll like .
ADRIANA: Come on , we 'll find a taxi . We 'll see you home - things will be etter in the morning .
GIL: Yes - I - I mean it 's in the future .
ADRIANA: Well good luck with your book and your wedding .
GIL: You 'd like Inez - she has a sharp sense of humor - and she 's sexy - not that we agree on everything .
ADRIANA: But the important things .
GIL: Actually the small things - the important things we do n't - she 'd like to live in Malibu and that I 'd work in Hollywood - but I will say we both like - er - er Indian food - not all Indian food - pita bread - we both like pita bread -
ADRIANA: I should go . Pablo will be missing me .
GIL: I 'll walk you home -
ADRIANA: NO , no иии Finish your drink . I live just around the corner .
GIL: No , I would n't think -
ADRIANA: I 'd prefer to be by myself fo awhile . Thank you for this evening .
DALI: We met earlier tonight . At the party .
GIL: Yes - I remember -
DALI: Dali - si ? Dali ! Dali ! Une outeille de vin rouge I waiter scurries for one .
GIL: A rhinoceros ? I never thought about it .
DALI: I paint rhinoceros . I paint you - sad eyes - big lips - melting ove hot sand - with one tear - yes - and in your tear - Christ 's face . And rhinoceros .
GIL: I 'm sure I look sad . I 'm in a very perplexing situation .
DALI: Everyone is in perplexing situation - to be or not to be - this is ultimate perplexing question - you agree ? Ah - here they are -
GIL: My god , I own a surrealist print - only a print by Magritte .
DALI: Pender - Pen-der - Pen-derrr - and I am Da-li . Pender is in perplexing situation .
GIL: It sounds so crazy when I say it and you 'll think I 'm drunk but I 've got to tell someone I 'm from a different time - a whole other era - the future - and I pass from the two thousandth millennium to here - a car picks me up - I slide through time -
MAN RAY: Exactly correct - you inhabit two worlds - so far I see nothing strange .
GIL: Look , you 're sur-realists - but I 'm a normal guy - See , in one life I 'm engaged to marry a woman I love - at least I think I love her . Christ , I 'm supposed to love her if I 'm marrying her .
DALI: Love - the word love - love - the word love - same as the word hinoceros - the rhinoceros makes love by mounting the female - but is there difference in beauty etween two rhinoceroses ?
MAN RAY: But there is nothing more sur-real than the human heart .
DALI: Past is also present .
GIL: In a dream - which is fine for you ecause you guys dabble in dreams .
MAN RAY: There is another woman ?
GIL: Adriana is her name . And I felt drawn to her - but it would n't matter - men much greater than me , profound artists - she 's drawn to geniuses - and they to her .
DALI: I see you with Christ - he is smiling while you are crucified on the heavy wooden cross of self- doubt .
GIL: Of course my biggest problem is eality . BuNuEL Reality is nothing more than a dream - we all exist in the dream of a dog .
DALI: Time is all the mind . Time melts - the watches melt - the hands of the clock melt иии
MAN RAY: A man in love with a woman from a different era . I see a photograph . BuNuEL I see a movie .
GIL: I see an insurmountable problem .
DALI: I see - a rhinoceros .
INEZ: Did you get much work done last night ?
GIL: Er - some - yes - I 'm beginning to think my book may be too realistic - that I 've missed some chances to let my imagination run wild and not e so damn logical иии
INEZ: Should n't we be getting dressed ?
GIL: C'mere - you always look great in the morning .
INEZ: We 'll be late .
GIL: I have to work . I 'm working like a demon but I ca n't resist you half dressed like that .
INEZ: Paul says we have to see the countryside . He 's taking us fo lunch at this beautiful little inn . I know you like making love in the morning but I find it much sexie late afternoon - just before we go out to dinner . Except I always have to explain to my parents why your cheeks look radiant . Hey- I 'm not going to force you . I know you 're hot on your writing . I 'll be happy when you finish this book and move on .
GIL: Hello - Bonjour - I 'd like to ask you a question about Rodin .
GUIDE: Yes ?
GIL: He loved his wife , he also loved his mistress - is it really possible to be in love with two women ?
GUIDE: He loved both in different ways .
GIL: God it 's so French . Er - you emember me ?
GUIDE: I do . Qui - you were with the group , the pedantic gentleman .
GIL: Yeah , pedantic - perfect word . You 're very observant . I need some advice . I 'd like a woman 's take . A French woman - an observant French woman . I met some woman that I very quickly became smitten with . Smitten ?
GUIDE: Uh-huh .
GIL: I 'm engaged to be married . I know Rodin had a wife and a mistress but I 'm American - we ca n't handle that - we 're monogamous .
GUIDE: You 're engaged and you met a new woman -
GIL: Yes . Her name 's Adriana . Right now she 's living with Picas with a Spaniard - er he paints - fairly well . ии
GUIDE: Yes - and does she love him ? O you ?
GIL: Love him or me ? Well I hardly think , me . But we 've just met . See , another very gifted man flirts with her , a writer . All these geniuses fall in love with her . And what am I ? And then of course there 's another big problem . I ca n't exactly explain .
GUIDE: Yes ?
GIL: I do n't know whether to call it an age difference - or a problem of geography - I 'm so messed up . I 'm not Hemingway , I 'm not Picasso , I 'm not Rodin . I 'm just a guy who was orn too late .
JOHN: Here 's his photo . I want to know where he goes each night .
DUBOIS: What is your suspicion ?
JOHN: He 's engaged to my daughter - to marry and I want to be certain she 's making a wise decision . Naturally discretion is paramount .
DUBOIS: You 've come to the right place , monsieur . Monsieur Tisserant - will personally keep track of the gentleman and report back on his whereabouts at night .
TOM: Come .
GIL: Thanks for stopping . Gil Pender .
TOM: Tom Eliot .
GIL: Tom Eliot ? Tom - Stearns - T.S . Eliot ? T.S . Eliot ? SHOT of Gil entering car .
STEIN: Oh Pender - I 'll get to your book in a moment . I finished it . We 're just in the middle of a little personal crisis .
GIL: I did n't mean to intrude .
STEIN: No , it 's no secret . Adriana has left Pablo and has flown to Africa with Ernest Hemingway .
GIL: What ?
PABLO: Sabia que tenia una obsesi6n con este fanforr6n . Sobre esto discutimos .
STEIN: Estoy seguro que regresara muy devoto . He took her hunting kudu but she 'll e back to him - the sound of hyenas every night when you 're trying to sleep in a tent gets on your nerves pretty quickly . Mt . Kilimanjaro is not Paris .
GIL: They 're on Mt . Kilimanjaro ?
STEIN: Now about your book . Very unusual indeed . In a way it 's almost science fiction - fiction with all the futuristic devices - television sets , supersonic flight - and yet it 's not typical science fiction - it 's unique .
GIL: Still , those sculptures -
STEIN: It 's the artist 's job not to succumb to despair but to find an antidote to the emptiness of existence . I find your voice clea and lively - do n't be such a defeatist .
HELEN: Tell Gil to bring a suit because tomorrow night we 'll be dining formal . Where 's Gil .
INEZ: I forgot to tell you . Gil is not going with us to Mont St. Michel .
JOHN: Why not ? I do n't understand it .
INEZ: He writes , he rewrites , he rewrites his rewrites . He says Picasso never left his studio .
HELEN: Well he 's going to miss a great weekend .
GIL: Any Cole Porter ?
GABRIELLE: Oh yes - I remember - he was you friend .
GIL: I was kidding you realize .
GABRIELLE: I did realize . You 're a bit young .
GIL: I 'm surprised you 're so familia with his work .
GABRIELLE: He wrote many songs about Paris - very beautiful .
GIL: Yes - he was in love with you hometown . You 're a Parisiene ?
GABRIELLE: Oui monsieur .
GIL: How much .
GABRIELLE: Dix-huit euro .
GIL: Can you translate this ? Speak English ? customer shrugs . Moves off .
GUIDE: That Paris exists and anyone could choose to live anywhere else in the world will always be a mystery to me . Turns pages .
GIL: It 's a little complicated to explain . Thanks for translating -
GUIDE: The writer clearly has feelings fo this man Gil . That 's your name , no ?
GIL: She finds him no genius - naive and unassuming - that 's not exactly dazzling .
GUIDE: To some women naivete is endearing . And she 's romantic . She dreams of Belle Epoque Paris and a gift of earrings and making love with this man . Gil stares , thinking .
GIL: Eleven - let 's see - where the hell am I going to get earrings at this hour ? I must improvise .
INEZ: Daddy got chest pains .
GIL: Really ?
JOHN: I 'm sure it 's indigestion .
HELEN: Well we ca n't take a chance .
INEZ: Daddy had an angioplasty three years ago .
JOHN: They put a balloon in me . Big deal .
HELEN: Yes - I want the hotel doctor - suite 818 .
INEZ: Why are you so dressed up ?
GIL: Me ? No - I was just writing .
INEZ: You dress and put on cologne to write ?
GIL: I took a break and showered . I think better in the shower . All those positive ions .
INEZ: We were halfway to Mont . St. Michele and Daddy started to look pale .
GIL: That 's terrible .
INEZ: We turned right around .
GIL: No - sure - is there anything I can get you , John ?
JOHN: I 'm fine . I 'm sure it 's the beef ourguignon .
INEZ: What 's this .
GIL: It 's nothing - nothing -
INEZ: What is that ? It 's a present .
GIL: Yes - yes иии it is . Because it 's gift wrapped иии but er - you 're not supposed to see that - it 's a surprise .
INEZ: You got me something ?
GIL: It 's nothing great - from the flea market .
INEZ: Let me open it .
GIL: No ! No - not now иии I got it for - I mean to give it to you at a special dinner - just leave it иии
INEZ: Now I 'm dying of curiosity . If it 's jewelry I hope it 's my taste - not like the moonstone necklace .
GIL: You did n't like the moonstones ? They 're understated yet elegant - Do n't you always say that , ha , ha .и .
HELEN: Cheap is cheap is what I always say .
INEZ: You never saw the necklace he got me . I 've never actually worn it . You 'll see why immediately . Opens her jewelry box , holds up moonstones .
GIL: I thought you 'd like thei simplicity .
INEZ: That 's just it , they 're too simple .
HELEN: I agree .
INEZ: Hey - where are my art nouveau earrings ?
GIL: You probably did n't pack them .
INEZ: I 've worn them here .
GIL: I guess you lost them . They probably dropped off .
INEZ: Both of them ? My ears are pierced .
HELEN: I told you to keep everything in the hotel safe .
INEZ: You think it was the maid ?
HELEN: It 's always the maid .
INEZ: I remember seeing them there this morning .
HELEN: I would report the theft right away .
INEZ: I 'll bet it was that maid . She was so snotty yesterday about turning out the beds . She goes to phone .
GIL: Gee I would n't jump to any conclusions . I mean an accusation of theft .
INEZ: I want to report a theft . I 'd like the house detective to please come to room 818 .
GIL: Oh god -
INEZ: I did n't like that maid from the first day , did n't I say that ? Door rings .
GIL: The maid was very sweet .
INEZ: Right . Take the side of the help as usual . That 's why Dad calls you a Communist .
DOCTOR: I 'm Dr. Gerard .
HELEN: Come in - he 's right there иии
JOHN: I 'm fine .
HELEN: He 's had an angioplasty .
GIL: Look ! Look ! Are these what you 're missing ?
INEZ: Where did you find them ?
GIL: They were in the bathroom .
INEZ: The bathroom ?
GIL: Right out on the sink .
HELEN: I was in the bathroom , I did n't see them .
GIL: Well you 're under stress иии
INEZ: Why the hell would they be in the athroom ?
GIL: Maybe you thought you put them away and left them out or dropped them , and the maid found them and left them out where you could see them easily .
INEZ: I did n't drop them or leave them out
GIL: The main thing is they 're not stolen .
DOCTOR: I 'm going to send you for some tests but I think that you are ight and this is only indigestion .
JOHN: See . Incidentally , it was very nice of you to come over so late .
HELEN: Yes - my god , is it midnight already ? Gil is disappointed .
STEIN: C'est l'un de vos meilleurs jusqu ' a present . Je parlai a Leo . Je pense qu'il souhaite l'acheter .
GIL: Five hundred francs ? For a Matisse ?
STEIN: Well ?
GIL: Oh er - I brought a rewrite of the first few chapters of my book and was hoping you would tell me if you thought I was on the right track .
STEIN: Leave it with me .
GIL: Er - have you heard from Hemingway ?
STEIN: Oh yes , they 've been back for days . The trip did n't work out . I knew they would n't hit it off . That 's over . with Picasso too . She 's at Deyrolles - by herself .
GIL: By herself ?
STEIN: On of those surrealist painters is getting married and they did it up there . She 'll be glad to see you .
ADRIANA: Oh - what are you doing here ?
GIL: I came to find you .
ADRIANA: You did ?
GIL: Let 's just say as a writer I see into women 's souls and I sense that you have very complicated feelings towards me .
ADRIANA: But you 're going to be married .
GIL: I 'm not so sure about anything anymore - can we just go where it 's quiet ?
ADRIANA: What are you doing ?
GIL: I do n't know but I do know that fo a brief moment , when I was doing it , I felt - immortal .
ADRIANA: But - you look so sad .
GIL: Because life is too mysterious fo me .
ADRIANA: It 's the time we live in . Everything moves so fast - life is noisy and complicated - not like the Belle Epoque . In those years Paris lived only for beauty .
GIL: I 've always been a logical person . I never took chances - did anything crazy - like move here when I first came or take a shot at being a real writer , not a Hollywood hired hand - ut I feel like letting everything go . Gil gives her earrings .
ADRIANA: How remarkable - they 're beautiful . A horse and carriage pulls up .
DIDIER: Monsieur , mademoiselle - on y vas .
ADRIANA: What ? Who are you ?
CHLOE: Montez . On y vas . Nous allons etre en retard .
GIL: What 's going on ? They get in .
ADRIANA: Where are we going ?
DIDIER: To drink champagne .
ADRIANA: This is so beautiful .
GIL: I do n't know what it is about this city but I must write a thank you note to the chamber of commerce .
MARIE: Welcome - and oh what marvelous outfits . So avant garde - please have some champagne .
ADRIANA: I ca n't believe this is happening to me .
GIL: The present - Yes , the present always seems worse than the past ut it ca n't be - to always think this generation is stupider and coarser than the last - and yet - here we are at Maxims tonight and yes , it 's fabulous .
ADRIANA: And I know just where I want to go after .
GIL: We should n't bother him .
ADRIANA: But we know he 's a lonely man иии he longs for company . They go over . She speaks to Lautrec .
LAUTREC: Merci madame .
ADRIANA: Pouvons nous vous offrir un verre ?
LAUTREC: J'en serai enchante mademoiselle . Prenez un siege je vous en prie .
ADRIANA: He 's asking us to sit down with him .
GIL: This much French I know .
LAUTREC: Etes vous Americain ?
GIL: I 'm American . Oui -
LAUTREC: Je l'ai devine a votre accent .
ADRIANA: Nous aimons , tous les vos dessins et peintures , en realite tout ce que vous faites .
GIL: Yes , I love your pictures too .
LAUTREC: Oh - puis-je vous presenter mes amis иии Monsieur Degas and Monsieu Gauguin .
ADRIANA: Ohmigoodness - hello - enchante - Is n't this thrilling ? You see the sketch he 's made ? Nobody can draw like that today - not Pablo , not Matisse - We see fine drawing , Lautrec style .
GIL: Parlez Anglais ?
DEGAS: No monsieur .
LAUTREC: 11 parle un petit peut .
GAUGUIN: I speak well - je parle tres bien .
DEGAS: Ah-
GAUGUIN: Degas and I were just talking about how - cette generation est depourvue de sens et mangue d'imagination .
ADRIANA: He says they find this generation sterile and empty -
GAUGUIN: La Renaissance est beaucoup mieux - etter to have lived during the Renaissance .
ADRIANA: No - this is the Golden Age - L'Age D'or .
DEGAS: Pas do tout - la Renaissance - c'etait mieux - leur vetements sont tres , tres modernes , tres originaux .
ADRIANA: He says your clothes are very modern and original .
GIL: Er - yes - Monsieur Lauren - Ralph . Should n't you be in Tahiti ?
GAUGUIN: I ? What ? Yes - I live on the island - a much better life than here - better there - but then I miss Paris - up and back - Qu'est que vous faites dans la vie ?
ADRIANA: What do I do ? Je suis etudiante . En haute couture - fashion designe ut studying -
DEGAS: Ah ga compte pour les vetements outrageux .
LAUTREC: Vous devriez la presenter a Richard .
GAUGUIN: He wants Degas to have you meet his friend Richard .
ADRIANA: Ballet costumes - my god - I do n't live here . I mean I do but I do n't . Je n'habite pas ici .
GIL: I would n't get into too many details with them . Let 's just leave it that we 're temporarily passing through .
ADRIANA: Can I speak with you a minute ? Permettez-moi de m'absenter un instant . Let 's never go back to the twenties .
GIL: What are you talking about ?
ADRIANA: I think we should stay here - it 's the start of the Belle Epoque - this is the greatest , most eautiful era Paris has ever known .
GIL: But I love the Jazz Age .
ADRIANA: The twenties are full of strife and uncertainty . But think of it , Gil - the two of us - in a lovely art nouveau home - I 'll work in the fashion world - I love the styles - you can write иии it 's the age of Debussy and Guimard . Maybe you can meet Balzac .
GIL: But what happened to the twenties and the Charleston and Cole Porter ?
ADRIANA: That 's the present , it 's dull .
GIL: It 's not the present for me - I 'm from 2010 .
ADRIANA: What do you mean ?
GIL: I dropped in on you just the way we dropped in on the 1890 's .
ADRIANA: You did ?
GIL: I wanted to escape my present just like you wanted to escape yours . To a golden age .
ADRIANA: Surely you do n't think the twenties are a golden age ?
GIL: To me they are .
ADRIANA: But I 'm from the twenties and I 'm tellin~ you the golden age is the Belle Epoque .
GIL: Yes but do n't you see - to these guys the golden age was the Renaissance . They 'd all trade the Belle Epoque to paint alongside Michelangelo or Titian . And those guys probably imagine life was etter when Kubla Khan was around . I 'm having an insight . A minor one ut that accounts for the anxiety of my dream .
ADRIANA: What dream ?
GIL: Last night I dreamed I ran out of zithromax - and then I went to the dentist and there was no novacaine - these people have no antibiotics -
ADRIANA: What are you talking about ?
GIL: And even in the twenties - no dishwashers - no 911 if you appendix bursts - no `` movies on demand '' и
ADRIANA: But if we love each other what does it matter when we live ?
GIL: Because if you stay here and this ecomes your present , sooner o later you 'll imagine another time was really the golden time . And so will I - I 'm beginning to see why it ca n't work , Adriana . The present has a hold on you because it 's your present and while there 's never any progress in the most important things , you get to appreciate - what little progress is made - the internet - Pepto- Bismol . The present is always going to seem unsatisfying because life itself is unsatisfying - that 's why Gauguin goes back and forth between Paris and Tahiti , searching - it 's my job as a write to try and come up with reasons why despite life being tragic and unsatisfying , it 's still worth it .
ADRIANA: That 's the problem with writers - you 're all so full of words - but I 'm more emotional . I 'm going to stay and live in Paris ' most glorious time . You made a choice to leave Paris once and you egretted it .
GIL: Yes , that one I regretted but it was a real choice and I made the wrong one . This is a choice etween accepting reality o surreal insanity .
ADRIANA: So finally you do love Inez more than me .
GIL: No - I love you - but this way lies madness - and if I 'm ever going to write anything worthwhile I 've got to get rid of my illusions and that I 'd be happier in the past is one of them .
ADRIANA: Goodbye , Gil .
GIL: Goodbye Adriana . Good luck .
STEIN: Ah - Pender - I read your rewrite . Yes иии you 're nicely on the right track . You 've understood me clearly . If the rest of the book eads as well when you 're done you 'll have something of value .
GIL: Thank you . I ca n't tell you how much this means to me .
STEIN: Hemingway who read your chapters and agrees it 's going to be a fine ook did have one plot suggestion .
GIL: Hemingway read it ? What was his suggestion ?
STEIN: He finds it hard to believe the protagonist does n't see his fiancee is having an affair that 's going on ight before his eyes .
GIL: with -
STEIN: The other character - the pedantic one -
GIL: It 's called denial . Thanks again . You 're Ezra Pound right ? T.S . Eliot says you owe him forty francs .
INEZ: You 're crazy - Paul and me ? Where did you get such an insane notion ?
GIL: From Ernest Hemingway . He thought it out and it makes perfect sense .
INEZ: Gil , your brain tumor 's acting up again .
GIL: There 's nothing crazy about Ernest Hemingway or Gertrude Stein o Fitzgerald or Salvador Dali -
INEZ: Nothing except they 've all been dead for years .
GIL: It was William Faulkner who said , the past is not dead .
INEZ: You 're a raving lunatic .
GIL: I guess I 'm too trusting . I 'm jealous and also trusting - cognitive dissonance , Scott Fitzgerald speaks of it .
INEZ: Gil -
GIL: I know it Inez - you can fool me ut not Hemingway .
INEZ: Jesus Christ I 'm dealing with a madman - okay - Paul and I had a few nights alone . We danced , we drank - you were always working - he 's very attractive , he spoke to me in French - the whole mystique of this corny city got to me - it 's over . We can put this all in perspective at home .
GIL: I 'm not going back .
INEZ: What ?
GIL: I 'm staying here . It 's not the omantic fling . Paris is Paris . It 's that I 'm not in love with you .
INEZ: What ?
GIL: A lot has happened to me since we got here . I wo n't begin to bore you - but - I know what that feeling of love is and it 's not us .
INEZ: Have you met someone else ? All those late night walks .
GIL: I was attracted to another woman ut it was the whole deal - meeting Gertrude Stein and Hemingway and Dali and Scott and Zelda -
INEZ: Honey , you better listen to yourself . You 're a psycho . You do n't know what you 're doing . You see everything here through magical colored glasses . You 're a California film writer with a house in Beverly Hills with two Mercedes ' . You 're not some kind of twenties expatriate novelist . Her parents enter from the adjoining suite .
HELEN: What 's going on ? We can hear every word .
GIL: If I 'm not happy I 'll move back . But right now I 'm going to stay .
INEZ: With who ? All your crazy hallucinatory friends ? Mother was ight about you - there 's a part missing .
JOHN: said that first .
INEZ: Anyone who 's protagonist makes a living selling old cap pistols and Joan Crawford cut out books .
GIL: You 're better off without me .
INEZ: Go ahead . Walk the streets - gush over the Parisian light and the ooftops .
GIL: Goodbye Inez . He goes .
JOHN: I had a private detective follow him - I knew he was up to no good .
INEZ: Daddy you did n't .
JOHN: I did . He saw him get into a ca at midnight each night and he followed close behind .
HELEN: What happened ?
JOHN: I do n't know . The detective agency says the detective is missing .
COUNT: A qui ai-je l'honneur ?
TISSERANT: Je me suis perdu - J'ai pas du tourner au bon endroit
COUNTESS: Guardes ! Guardes !
COUNT: Qu'on lui coupe la tete !
GIL: Hey , I know you - the girl at the flea market .
GABRIELLE: Oh yes - yes - the Cole Porter one .
GIL: What are you doing here ?
GABRIELLE: I 'm returning from dinner with my girlfriends . I live near here .
GIL: What 's your name ?
GABRIELLE: Gabrielle .
GIL: Gabrielle , - I 'm Gil - I just moved to Paris this week .
GABRIELLE: Oh I 'm sure you 'll love it .
GIL: Can I walk along with you or can I uy you a coffee ? Oh god , it 's starting to rain .
GABRIELLE: That 's okay . I do n't mind getting wet . Paris is the most beautiful in the rain .
GIL: Oh what a thing to say . I could n't agree more .
GABRIELLE: I just thought about you the othe day because my boss got in a whole album of Cole Porter songs .
GIL: Hey what are those bells ?
GABRIELLE: It 's midnight .
GIL: Midnight - right - right - pretty name .
RUTH: Jill . What did I tell you ?
JILL: But Joe started it !
RUTH: It 's not good for them to interact with us . Besides , that was n't Joe . It was Marley .
JILL: No it was n't . It was Joe .
RUTH: Joe is just a baby , Jill . He was too big to be Joe .
JILL: Check . Check the pictures .
JILL: I was right , was n't I ?
RUTH: My notes say that Joe is only six months old . Either I got confused , or he 's a very unusual gorilla .
JILL: I told you so .
RUTH: Yes , you did . And Mommy 's going to write it down in her book .
JILL: Goodnight , Kweli . Ruth turns .
RUTH: Kweli ? What is it ?
KWELI: You should come . Quickly .
JILL: Mommy , can I
RUTH: Stay here , Jill .
KWELI: Stay here , child .
RUTH: Poachers .
AFRICANS: n'gai zamu ! n'gai zamu ! Garth steps closer to keep up with Strasser .
GARTH: They 're at it again .
STRASSER: Mystical nonsense . There 's only one thing they should be afraid of on this mountain . And it 's staring them right in the face !
GARTH: Gorilla . We 're close .
GARTH: Get the baby !
STRASSER: Do n't shoot it ! They want the abies alive ! ! Bring the sack !
STRASSER: She 's got to be here somewhere . She 's got that damn devil with her .
GARTH: I think you might 've hit the woman .
STRASSER: These people want to live like heroes , let them die like heroes .
STRASSER: That little demon took off my damn trigger finger . Monstrule !
GARTH: Your little 'monster ' could n't have gone far . Want to keep looking or ?
STRASSER: No . Let 's get out of here .
JILL: Mom !
RUTH: I know , I know . Shhh .
JILL: He 's scared .
RUTH: Poor baby . He lost his mommy tonight .
JILL: I I promise .
KWELI: Do n't worry , little one . I will take care of you .
GREGG: You must be Pindi . Pindi flashes him a broad smile .
PINDI: The one and only , bro .
PINDI: Six men , three cars everything you ask for , Mr. Ohara . All paid for in advance , out of Pindi 's pocket
GREGG: Sweet-looking bunch of guys .
PINDI: These men are the best I assure you . Very best .
GREGG: We 're not hunting anything .
PINDI: Ah ! Tranquilizer darts . I agree much nicer to animals than ullets .
GREGG: Your men know how to use this , right ?
PINDI: Oh sure , boss . Only professionals here .
GREGG: There .
PINDI: There ? Uh , boss , that is not such a good mountain . The men do n't like it very much at all . You see there is a legend they believe in , that a creature lives there Gregg 's back to checking his equipment .
GREGG: ' N'Gai Zamu . ' The sacred guardian of Mount Pangani .
PINDI: You know it ? How funny ! That 's not , by any chance , what you are looking for , is it , boss ?
GREGG: Looking for a legend ? No . Why would I do that ? Gregg takes the car keys from Pindi 's hand .
GREGG: Gim me those . OFF Pindi not particularly thrilled
PINDI: What are you listening to ?
GREGG: Sounds .
PINDI: Like that right there ?
GREGG: Yup . Pindi nods .
PINDI: I understand completely jungle sounds ! Very important . I know a guy , he can get you a C.D . of jungle sounds , cheap . Even cheaper if you buy ten . Gregg puts his hand up to signal for quiet . He hears something .
GREGG: You 're a beauty .
PINDI: Why ask for a cage if you are not keeping the animal ?
GREGG: Because I 'm only keeping this .
PINDI: Yes , but I know a guy , in Botswana , he 'd pay you ten thousand American dollars for that leopard . I 'd be willing to split with you fifty/fifty .
GREGG: Put the cat down now .
PINDI: You heard him put it down ! They never understand me . I do n't know what to do
PINDI: Uh , excuse me . Time to flee , ight ?
GREGG: Do n't anybody move .
PINDI: How about I move just ove here
GREGG: Come on ! ! We 're going after him !
PINDI: What is this 'we ' ? There is no way my men will ever agree to Gregg yells to the paralyzed trackers
GREGG: Three times your price . Triple your fee .
GREGG: Herd him towards me ! I got ta get close . Gregg grabs his DNA stick and grins at Pindi .
GREGG: Experienced trackers , my ass !
GREGG: Hold the wheel !
PINDI: Oh , sure .
PINDI: I hope you are planning on throwing that at him , because
GREGG: Pindi ! Look out !
PINDI: Stop !
GREGG: Get those men down the mountain . They need help .
PINDI: Crazy Americans !
PINDI: Get us out of here . They PEEL OUT of there
GREGG: Oh , wow .
JILL: Joe
GREGG: Where am I ?
KWELI: The infirmary . You 've been unconscious for an entire night . You 're lucky to be alive .
GREGG: Strange , I do n't feel lucky .
KWELI: You crashed your vehicle . It is waiting for you outside .
GREGG: You 're an injury behind . The kicker was getting dropped on my head by N'gai Zamu . Kweli chuckles .
KWELI: N'Gai Zamu is just a legend , my friend .
GREGG: No , he 's a giant gorilla with a mean backhand . There was also a woman Gregg tries to get up . It 's an ordeal .
KWELI: A woman ?
GREGG: Out in the jungle . She saved my life . A beautiful woman . Kweli gives him a patronizing smile .
KWELI: You were dreaming , Mr. Ohara .
GREGG: No . I never remember my dreams .
KWELI: It would be wise for you to see a doctor in Kimjayo . I took the liberty of calling one for you .
GREGG: Do n't need one .
KWELI: But he is expecting you . If you can drive , you should leave today .
GREGG: Damnit .
SCHOOL CHILDREN: Hello ! Hello ! Hello !
KWELI: Our visitor must be feeling etter . He should be leaving the infirmary today .
JILL: Looks like he just has .
JILL: He 's walking so soon . Joe should have dropped him harder .
KWELI: He 's not a poacher , Jill . He 's working for an animal conservancy in California .
JILL: He ca n't be trusted . He 's an outsider .
KWELI: A grateful outsider . He told me he was saved yesterday by a woman . A beautiful woman .
JILL: And what did you tell him ?
KWELI: What could I tell him ? He knows what he saw . He 's not a fool .
JILL: I 'll be the judge of that .
JILL: Hey , handsome . How are you ?
JILL: What were you thinking yesterday , letting those men see you ? Do n't do that again , okay ? Please . Please .
JILL: Oh , my God ! I ca n't find Joe . Where 's Joe ?
JILL: Come out , come out whereve you are !
JILL: Now get out of here , Joe . Run .
GREGG: Nobody better try and tell me I imagined this .
JILL: Anything broken ?
GREGG: No no . I think I 'm oh .
JILL: Hmm it looks okay . I think it 's still working .
GREGG: Oh good .
JILL: Well I can fix that .
GREGG: Hey wait a minute !
JILL: You . You 're the problem . That 's the second time I 've stopped you from being ripped in two and next time I 'm just going to watch . Understand ?
GREGG: You saved me . I 'm grateful . Now I just want to talk to you Miss Young .
JILL: So ?
GREGG: So it 's why I 'm here .
GREGG: She knew about Joe ? Did she have a theory on him ? How old is he ? I ca n't believe you kept him a secret all these years . How 'd you manage that ?
JILL: By keeping people like you off the mountain .
GREGG: You got this all wrong . I want to help you .
JILL: You 're not helping anybody here . You 're just making matters worse .
GREGG: How 's that ?
JILL: This mountain will be crawling with people , thanks to you . You go back to wherever you 're from , put the word out
GREGG: The word is out . It 's done . I 'm not the only one who saw him , remember ? Rare animals mean big money and Joe 's as rare as they come . It 's going to e tough to protect him here . Maybe impossible . Jill spins on him .
JILL: 'Here ' is Joe 's home . And 'here ' is where he must live . He does n't have a choice .
GREGG: That 's not true . Place that sent me could take care of Joe . They got the facilities
JILL: Just what Joe needs . A cage .
GREGG: Not a cage , a preserve . A place where he 'll be free from poachers , free from land development
JILL: But he wo n't be free .
GREGG: How long do you think Joe will stay free here ? I 'm telling you there 's gon na be a hunt starting on this mountain tomorrow . And I do n't expect they 'll give it up until one of them bags the prize . You should think about it .
ANDERSON: Tell me , why is it that you keep such a low profile about this wonderful place ?
STRASSER: Our only interest is the well- eing of our animals .
ANDERSON: Well , I think I 've come to the ight place for Morris .
STRASSER: Poor thing . Yes , he will be much happier here on our preserve . Back to the wild . Free again .
GARTH: Phone for you . Urgent . Strasser stands .
STRASSER: Will you excuse me , Mr. Anderson ?
GARTH: Looks like a big fellah . I 'll set a new record with you .
STRASSER: Strasser .
PINDI: Not what I want , boss , what you want . How about a giant gorilla ?
STRASSER: Talk .
PINDI: Big as three men , two thousand pounds , at least .
STRASSER: You 've been drinking , have n't you ?
PINDI: Swear to God , boss . Saw him with my own two eyes .
STRASSER: Do n't waste my time again .
PINDI: Hello ? Boss
POACHER: Stupid girl ! What do you think you 're doing ?
JILL: I found this in the forest this morning . Thought maybe you dropped it and might want it back .
KWELI: Come here immediately ! You are needed at the school this moment !
JILL: My mother would have been proud of what I did today .
KWELI: Proud ? Of that foolishness out there ? Of you risking your life ?
JILL: She risked hers why should n't I isk mine ? I 'm just doing what I promised , and I promised to protect Joe . And I 'm going to do everything I can to stop the poachers
KWELI: You ca n't stop them . Even she could n't stop them .
JILL: They do n't want him . They wo n't let him come .
KWELI: Maybe or maybe you wo n't let him go .
JILL: He needs me .
KWELI: The danger here is building fo oth of you . I feel it and so do you . Jill looks away . She knows he 's right .
JILL: Leaving ? Gregg nods , continuing packing .
GREGG: I 'm gon na head up the mountain . See if I can throw some of the poachers off the trail .
JILL: You think it will work ?
GREGG: Not for long . Just trying to buy you a little time , that 's all . With more of these bastards arriving every hour , I suggest you get Joe as deep into the jungle as you can as fast as you can .
JILL: Okay !
GREGG: Okay what ?
JILL: Okay we 'll go . Gregg turns and looks at her .
GREGG: We ?
JILL: Me and Joe . To that place of yours in California . What ? ! You did n't think you could take him without me , did you ?
GREGG: You 're sure about this ?
JILL: No . I am completely unsure about this . But I 'll do it . On one condition .
GREGG: Name it .
JILL: I 'm in charge of Joe .
GREGG: Done .
JILL: Done ? Just like that ? That was way too easy .
GREGG: You 're not a very trusting soul are you , Miss Young ?
JILL: No , I 'm not .
GREGG: Tough , is n't it ? Trying to measure me up decide if I 'm a fraud
JILL: or a fool . Gregg smiles , half sour , half amused .
GREGG: Well , I 'd like to know if you 're a bona fide lunatic or just a mixed up monkey girl but but I guess we 'll have to take ou chances and figure it out as we go along .
GREGG: Come on , Jill . Trust it . You 'll e in charge of Joe . Let 's shake on it .
JILL: I do n't shake . That 's not how we make pacts around here .
GREGG: Alright , how do you make pacts around here ?
JILL: You have to endure a bite from a Makiki spider .
GREGG: A what ?
JILL: You 'll have a high fever and hallucinations . You 'll say things lots of things . We 'll hear what 's in your heart . Then , if your intentions prove true , the pact is made . Gregg nods to himself , considering .
GREGG: A spider bite and hallucinations ?
JILL: That 's right .
GREGG: Then you 'll trust me and let me have Joe ?
JILL: That 's right . Well ? Gregg cocks his head .
GREGG: Well I think that 's the iggest load of crap I 've eve heard .
JILL: Good . Maybe you 're not a fool after all .
GREGG: Get your things together . Fast . We 're getting out of here as soon as we can .
JILL: I do n't know what else to do .
HARRY: This is crazy . All I said was , 'Bring back some blood samples . ' So what does he bring back ? A giant gorilla .
CECILY: Do n't even pretend to be upset , Harry .
HARRY: You know how much it cost to convert the tiger habitat ? Try half our operating budget .
CECILY: You 'll be on the cover of National Geographic , Harry .
HARRY: Hey , I just said it was crazy . I did n't say it was n't worth it . They continue walking , and we
JILL: There are more cars on this oad than I 've seen in my entire life , total .
GREGG: Welcome to L.A .
JILL: Think he 's okay back there ? I think he 's okay back there . Three seconds pass .
GREGG: Do n't worry . He 's doing fine .
JILL: Sorry . I 'm a little tense . Yeah . I think he 's okay back there .
GREGG: Good . Thanks for the update .
JILL: So this is L.A . It all looks the same . How do you know where you are ?
GREGG: Beach is that way , mountains are that way , Mexico 's that way , Canada 's that way . Do n't worry about the rest you 'll never see it through the smog .
JILL: Ha ha .
CONSERVANCY WORKER: Main gate to Dr. Banks . They 're pulling up now .
CECILY: Elvis is in the building ! I epeat , Elvis is in the building
HARRY: Gregg , or the gorilla ? They both turn as
HARRY: I 'm confused , O'Hara . You phone us to say you 're bringing back a two thousand pound wild animal
GREGG: Hello , Harry . Cecily .
CECILY: Welcome back , baby .
HARRY: but security tells me you 've equested no firehoses , no estraints of any kind
GREGG: Let me introduce you to
HARRY: How are we supposed to control the animal ? With a giant , olled-up Harry trails off as Jill gets out of the car .
GREGG: Jill Young , Dr. Harry Ruben he un the place and Dr. Cecily Banks , who makes sure he does n't screw it up .
CECILY: Chief veterinarian . Hi .
JILL: Hello . It 's a privilege to meet you both .
JILL: Coming , Joe ! Hold on ! I think he 'd like to come out now if you do n't mind .
HARRY: Mind ? No , of course I do n't mind .
GREGG: Harry ? I think it 's time you met Joe . They start moving to the trailer
HARRY: Hold it !
JILL: We wo n't need any of that .
HARRY: Miss Young , we know what we 're doing here , and the best way to Gregg steps forward .
GREGG: Harry you and I made an agreement . The lady 's in charge of Joe .
JACK: Easy , big boy .
VERN: Do n't forget who 's gon na feed you .
JILL: I 'll take it from here .
HARRY: You sure she knows what she 's doing ? Gregg 's watching Jill with quiet admiration .
GREGG: She knows .
JILL: Come on , Joe . Come on , big guy .
CECILY: That is one , big gorilla .
HARRY: Hey ! What do I pay you for ? Get some shots of me , too .
JILL: Come on , ya big baby . Come on ack . Do I have to come in there and get you myself ?
JILL: That 's it . That-a-boy .
GREGG: Go on , Joe . Go on .
HARRY: Alright . Take the platform away .
JILL: Hold on I 'm going in with him .
HARRY: No . We ca n't allow that . We do n't have insurance to cove anyone in there who 's not an employee .
GREGG: Harry
JILL: But you said I 'm in charge of Joe .
HARRY: Yes . And I 'm in charge of this facility .
JILL: ' I 'm in charge of this facility . ' Who is that guy ? I bet that man has n't spent one night outside in his entire life .
GREGG: Probably not .
JILL: You said I was going to be in charge of Joe . I should be sleeping down there , with him , not in this this cage .
GREGG: I 'll do everything I can for you . They hold each other 's eyes .
JILL: Thank you . Gregg walks out .
CECILY: Where 's Gregg ?
HARRY: Beats me . He collected his pay check . He 's probably in some jungle by now , not using deodorant .
CECILY: I think he should be here . This is his discovery , after all .
HARRY: Excuse me , Gregg 's expertise is pitching tents , not explaining primate behavior to the Chairman of the Conservancy Board .
CECILY: Know what I think , Harry ?
HARRY: I have a feeling I 'm gon na find out .
CECILY: I think you 're jealous .
HARRY: Just once I wanted to go into the field and find a new species mollusk , anything . Instead , he makes the zoological discovery of the century .
CECILY: And he still has a full head of hair .
HARRY: That 's not funny . Cecily nods to the road .
CECILY: Heads up .
HARRY: Elliot . Good to see you again .
BAKER: Harry . Dr. Banks . He claps his hands together .
CECILY: Right this way .
HARRY: I always had a suspicion that the legend coming out of the Pangani forest might have some truth to it . It was just a hunch sort of a gut feeling but I sent my field zoologist to check it out .
CECILY: That field zoologist , Dr. O'Hara , had a theory and Joe 's blood work confirms it . The gorillas in the Pangani carry a recessive gene that pops up every four or five generations with this rare form of gigantism .
BAKER: And that 's where the legend comes from ! That zoologist of yours what 's his name , Harry ?
HARRY: Gregg O'Hara .
BAKER: Pretty damn sharp .
HARRY: Here we are .
BAKER: Where is he ?
HARRY: Joe ! Here , Joe ! I told him the Chairman of the Board was coming and he promised to come say 'hi . '
BAKER: Well I do n't see him .
HARRY: Mmmm . We 'll feed him . That 'll get him to come out .
CECILY: Uh , Harry
HARRY: I know what I 'm doing . Let 's open the gate .
GREGG: I was coming to get you .
JILL: What is that noise ?
GREGG: Come on !
CECILY: It 's Joe , he 's gone crazy ! Jill and Gregg follow Cecily towards
GREGG: Stop !
JILL: Harry ! Jump out from behind the tree !
GREGG: Do it , Harry !
HARRY: You found me ! There is a tense moment , then
JILL: He 's playing hide and seek .
BAKER: Put that girl in charge of the gorilla , Harry .
HARRY: What ? Elliot , she 's got no scientific
BAKER: That ape is the best fund-raising tool this conservancy has eve seen . He 's happy I 'm happy . Put her on the payroll . Baker turns and walks away .
JILL: He 's playing ! Did you see ?
GREGG: I saw .
JILL: He likes it here ! Is n't it great ?
GREGG: It 's great .
CECILY: Sorry , babe , but in a pissing match the monkey kicks your ass .
GREGG: What are you talking about ?
CECILY: Oh please . I was wondering why you had n't taken off yet . Normally , you 're out the door soon as the animal 's in his habitat .
GREGG: You 've got an active imagination , Cecily .
CECILY: I do n't think so . I think Mr. World Traveller has goo-goo eyes for the gorilla girl .
GREGG: Like what you 've done with the place .
JILL: Too bad it 's always so cold somebody broke my window .
GREGG: I just came by to tell you that I think Joe looks real good out there
JILL: I know ! This is working out etter than I expected .
GREGG: and that I 'm hitting the road .
JILL: Where you going ?
GREGG: Back to Africa . For a couple of months . Jill stays light .
JILL: No kidding ? When do you leave ?
GREGG: Now . Jill just nods .
JILL: Oh of course .
GREGG: Yeah . Well
JILL: Say hello to Africa for me .
STRASSER: My God . Pindi was right .
GARTH: And the most valuable , that 's fo sure .
STRASSER: I want him . He belongs here with me .
GARTH: It 'll be a bit tricky , wo n't it ? They 're not gon na want to part with
STRASSER: Wait ! Be quiet ! Strasser points to the television
GARTH: Bloody hell . That 's the little monster that
STRASSER: I am always amazed how , if you wait long enough , the opportunity for justice finally comes .
HARRY: This fellow is one of only three hundred wild yaks remaining on the planet . There are those who would ask , why should we care if this sub-species of yak survives ?
V.I.P. #1: Excuse me . Can we see Joe ?
HARRY: You certainly can for the mere price of a 'Diamond Circle Benefactor Ticket ' to tomorrow night 's benefit .
JILL: Harry see what 's in that cart ? That 's all we have left of the lobelia leaves for Joe . Did you y any chance place that new order I asked for ?
HARRY: Of course I actually , perhaps
JILL: I would n't be surprised if you forgot , considering you have so much on your mind .
HARRY: I 'll go rush order it for you now .
JILL: Thank you so much . Cecily rolls her eyes . Jill winks at he conspiratorially .
CECILY: She 's nice . I 'm not . If you forget to order something I need , I 'll knock you upside the head .
HARRY: I keep telling you stop talking to me like that .
CECILY: Please . You love it .
GREGG: Lobelia leaves . Should have called me in Africa . I would have ought 'em back for ya .
JILL: You 're back early . What happened ? Run out of humvees to crash ?
GREGG: No just wanted to get back .
JILL: Really ? And why is that ?
GREGG: Guess I missed Harry .
JILL: No thanks . I still do n't want to leave Joe .
GREGG: 'Still ' ? Have n't you been out of here yet ?
JILL: What 's to see ? Beach is that way , mountains are that way , Mexico 's that way , Canada 's that way
GREGG: Come on . Have dinner with me , Jill . You wo n't find a better excuse to brush your hair .
JILL: I 'll brush my hair if you take a shower .
GREGG: Deal .
GARTH: You remember , do n't you ?
JILL: So this is what you call a good meal in a fine restaurant ?
GREGG: Yeah .
JILL: Do n't point that smile at me . I 'm still mad at you for taking off and leaving me here all alone .
GREGG: I 'm sorry I had things I had to do
JILL: Uh-huh
GREGG: Besides , you were n't all alone . You had Joe .
JILL: That 's right . Me and Joe . Just like always .
GREGG: Growing up with him around what 's it been like for you ? I mean most guys are afraid of girls ' fathers . I can just see a guy telling Joe he 'll get you home by midnight
JILL: Never had anyone to bring home anyway . All that stuff I do n't even know what it 's like .
GREGG: All what 'stuff ' ?
JILL: Whatever you want to call it . Being in love .
GREGG: Well it 's kinda like getting it by a makiki spider .
JILL: Oh yeah ? How 's that ?
GREGG: You 'll get a kind of a fever
JILL: Fever ? Really . How high ?
GREGG: Pretty high .
JILL: Interesting . Hallucinations with that ?
GREGG: Oh yeah and you 'll , uh find yourself saying things . Lots of things .
JILL: Aaah !
VERN: He 's ripping out saplings like am-bam-bam !
JACK: And taking out irrigation pipes . One good yank on comes the flood .
HARRY: He just pulled out another acacia tree . You know what I paid fo those ?
GREGG: Do you know what 's wrong with him ? Cecily shakes her head `` no . ''
CECILY: Do you ? Jill 's brow is furrowed with concern .
JILL: No .
HARRY: Well could you get in there and calm him down before he pulls out the rest of my landscaping ?
BAKER: Impossible .
JILL: Please , Mr. Baker I would n't be asking you to postpone the benefit unless I thought there was something really wrong with Joe . And I do .
BAKER: From what I heard , you sang him to sleep last night like a baby . What 's really wrong about that ?
JILL: I swear to you , Joe 's still not himself he 's nervous and agitated . He should n't be exposed to a crowd of strangers right now . If you would only delay the party a few more
BAKER: It 's too late , Jill .
JILL: No . It 's too soon .
BAKER: Miss Young , let me give you some advice . Stop worrying about Joe , and start worrying about what you 'll wear tomorrow night .
JILL: Oh ! Excuse me . The man rights himself and smiles politely .
STRASSER: No , excuse me . My fault .
JILL: Yes ?
STRASSER: And you look just like her .
JILL: How wonderful to meet you . What are you doing here ? Strasser pretends to look uncomfortable .
STRASSER: I 've come to talk with your Mr. Baker . You see , I am here for Joe . And , in a way , for your mother , too . I believe she would agree with me a magnificent wild animal like Joe needs more space like the Raha Preserve I run in Botswana .
JILL: Raha ? A preserve ?
STRASSER: I have twenty thousand acres there where the animals are free to run . I would like to offer them to Joe . Here , it 's such a shame to see Joe living in a man-made habitat and being used as an attraction to raise money
JILL: I 'll look forward to it .
STRASSER: Good-bye .
CECILY: Do n't you clean up nice .
GREGG: Cecily you 're ravishing . Harry you got shrimp on you shirt .
HARRY: Of course . I look ridiculous .
CECILY: No . You look fine . They look ridiculous .
HARRY: Hel-lo . Look what we have here .
CECILY: I picked out the dress . Are n't I smart ?
GREGG: Brilliant .
CECILY: Shut your mouth , Harry you 're catching flies .
JILL: Tell me the truth do I look stupid in this ? Everyone is staring at me .
GREGG: They 're not staring at you . They 're staring at that uh anana tower .
JILL: Very funny .
GARTH: Quite a turnout they have here .
STRASSER: All the better .
BAKER: When was the last time you laid eyes on something so unique , so spectacular , that it literally took your breath away ? Well , prepare yourselves , for tonight you will have such an experience .
JACK: There 's nothing in this punch , man . I could drink twelve of these and not feel a thing .
VERN: Sorry ! Here 's your uh key chain .
STRASSER: Thank you . Vern and Jack stumble on , none the wiser . Strasser and Garth slip out .
STRASSER: So you have n't forgotten me . Good . Have you forgotten this ?
GARTH: What do you think the big guy is worth ? A couple million ?
STRASSER: I will get that for the paws alone . After we sell him off piece by piece , who knows how much we 'll make ?
GARTH: Got you going now ! That should attle the jewelry off the ladies .
STRASSER: Hang it there where he can see it . And come back for it after .
BAKER: and now to introduce ou emarkable new acquisition , I would like to bring up to the podium the director of the conservancy
HARRY: In the time it took you to drive here tonight , three species have disappeared from the Earth . Extinct . Never to return . We here at the conservancy say this is a tragedy
HARRY: But tonight , rather than focusing on what we 've lost , I 'm going to introduce you to something we 've found .
JILL: Hey , Joe . I 'm right here . You hea me ? Good boy . Take it easy , Joe . We do n't want to scare anybody , do we ?
JILL: My God . What 's wrong with him ?
GREGG: We 've got to bring him down . I 'm going for the tranq guns .
JILL: No let me stop him .
TERRY: Faster ! Faster !
RAY: I 'm trying !
BAKER: Joe has been transferred to a special steel reinforced concrete unker .
JILL: Joe look at me . Over here , big guy . Joe barely reacts . Jill is near tears .
JILL: I knew something was wrong with him .
GREGG: What do you think happened out there ?
JILL: Joe never would have hurt all those people unprovoked something must have got to him .
GREGG: Something . Or someone .
HARRY: Can I talk to you for a second ?
GREGG: Well this was n't in the brochure , was it ?
HARRY: The City Attorney talked to Baker . It was n't my decision , and there 's nothing I can do about it .
JILL: About what ?
HARRY: Joe stays in there until they decide what to do with him .
JILL: In there ? Harry , look at him . He 's depressed , he wo n't eat . If he stays in there , he 'll die within days .
HARRY: So sue me . Everybody else is .
JILL: Listen , Harry , either you tell them you 're getting Joe out of there o I will !
HARRY: Do n't you get it ? This is way eyond you , and me . Joe freaked out on some very influential people . He 's a public relations nightmare . No zoo will take a two-thousand-pound killer gorilla
JILL: He 's not a killer !
HARRY: and unless you can write a check for millions of dollars to uy him a big back yard somewhere , Joe 's got nowhere to go .
JILL: That 's it ? You 're not going to do anything ?
JILL: I need your help .
GREGG: You got it .
CECILY: Good evening .
A.C. OFFICER: 'Evening .
GREGG: We 're conservancy doctors . Do me a favor stay here and guard the door .
JILL: Come on , Joe . We 're leaving . Let 's get you out of here .
CECILY: I 'm Dr. Banks , the head vet . And I 'm taking Joe for a CAT Scan .
A.C. OFFICER: I take my orders from Mr. Baker . Put him back in the cage . Now .
GREGG: Officer , you do n't want to point that gun at him , believe me .
JILL: He did n't believe you . The Officer slumps to the ground .
CECILY: Bring him out .
STRASSER: Jill , I got the plane . It 's waiting at the airport . We must hurry .
CECILY: I 'm going to miss your ugly face . Be good , Joe .
HARRY: You 'd better leave out of the west gate . The guard there got called away . Urgent business .
JILL: You 're not such a big coward afte all .
HARRY: Okay , okay , let go .
CECILY: Write me when Joe gets settled .
JILL: I promise .
GREGG: I think I better stay here and keep people away from that bunker . Give you a head start before they ealize he 's gone .
JILL: Well if you 're ever in Botswana , come by and take me out to a good meal in a fine restaurant . That is , if you 're not afraid to tell Joe that you 'll get me home by
GREGG: Take care of her for me , will ya ?
STRASSER: Jill ! We must go !
GARTH: Hello .
STRASSER: Do n't worry , Jill . Soon Joe will e back home again . Jill looks straight ahead .
CECILY: How many minutes do you give it efore the whole world knows he 's missing ?
GREGG: Five . How many minutes do you give it before we 're both lookin ' through the want ads ?
CECILY: Six .
GREGG: What 're you guys doing here so late ?
JACK: Baker wants the tent cleaned up A.S.A.P . Vern holds out the box .
VERN: Check out the loot we plundered in the wake of mass party panic ! This is some weird lost and found , man .
JACK: Yeah , and we 've got the fun jo of getting this stuff back to everybody . Somebody 's head is cold !
GREGG: Where did you find this ?
VERN: Oh that was by the habitat . Guess we 've got to find those two guys again .
GREGG: What two guys ?
JACK: That , uh What do you think that one guy is ? Russian ? Lithuanian ?
CECILY: Be careful ! They watch him go .
JILL: Please ! Be careful
STRASSER: Always worrying , eh ? Your mothe was a worrier , too . Always worrying about the gorillas . It made her a lot of enemies . It led to tragedy .
JILL: My mother was brave .
STRASSER: So are you , my dear .
STRASSER: It 's not so pretty , I know .
JILL: I 'm sorry . What happened ? Strasser and Garth exchange amused glances .
STRASSER: Well you could say I had an encounter with a monster . Monstrule .
JILL: Murdering bastard !
JILL: Joe ! Get out !
STRASSER: Drive ! Garth FLOORS it . The truck speeds away .
JILL: What have I done ? Mother , oh , God , what have I done Do you know who they are ?
GREGG: I know . Gregg half-carries her to the truck .
STRASSER: Wait .
GARTH: Police 'll be here any minute .
TOURIST: Hey ! It 's that gorilla that was on TV !
RAY: Whoa Hey , Joe !
COP: Up there ! The Cop points up to

JILL: Joe ! Joe !
EXCITED NEIGHBORS: This way !
JILL: No ! He 's not dangerous ! You 're dangerous ! You 're dangerous !
GREGG: She did n't mean that .
JILL: Yes I did .
GREGG: Better cool it , baby .
JILL: They 're going to shoot him .
GREGG: Not if we find him first . POLICE HELICOPTERS BUZZ by overhead .
GARTH: What are you doing ? You do n't think we can get the gorilla now , do you ?
STRASSER: We need a car . Now .
RUBBERNECKER: Fifth goddamn time this year .
GREGG: Any idea where he might 've headed ?
JILL: Look . She points out THROUGH the windshield .
JASON: Mom , I do n't think I can let you go on the ferris wheel .
JASON'S MOTHER: Why not ?
JASON: Because the last time after you ate two hot dogs , you threw up , emember ?
JASON'S MOTHER: What if I promised to throw up over the side ? They both giggle at her joke .
JASON: Mom , I think I should do this ide by myself .
JASON'S MOTHER: Okay I 'll watch you .
JILL: He 's got ta be here . Do you see him ?
GARTH: Hold on , now just who are you aiming at ?
GARTH: No . You ca n't do that .
STRASSER: If that girl starts telling people who we really are , ou whole cover operation will be lown . Strasser aims his rifle again .
GARTH: She 's not an animal . That 's a human being you 're about to kill . Strasser fixes Garth with an icy stare .
STRASSER: Go wait in the car .
JENNY'S MOTHER: Oh God
STRASSER: That was very stupid , Garth .
GARTH: You 're not a hunter , you 're a murderer , and I wo n't be a part of this
STRASSER: Anything else on your mind ?
JILL: What was that ?
GREGG: Go find Joe , get him out of here . I 'm gon na see if I can help . Gregg moves off towards the Ferris wheel .

ALPHA 5: Ay , yi , yi , yi , yi ! Ou thermionic-sensors have been hit y a CATACLYSMIC surge of evil !
ZORDON: Rangers , you must act swiftly . The planet is in GRAVE danger !
KIMBERLY: Danger from what ?
ZORDON: Six thousand years ago a morphological being known as Ivan Ooze , ruled the world with a eign of unparalleled terror . Finally , a rebel factor known as the `` Order of the Meledon '' lured him into a hyperlock chamber and uried him deep underground .
ALPHA 5: In a place that came to be known as Angel Grove .
ZORDON: The chamber has been accidently UNCOVERED ! You must return it to the depths . or anyone should open it and Ivan is released !
ALPHA 5: To assist you I have retro-fitted your helmets with new Opti-Scan devices .
ZORDON: Use extreme caution , Rangers . You are dealing with an evil here that is beyond ALL comprehension .
RITA: Another Saturday night and I 'm traipsing around the galaxy with the THREE LITTLE PIGS ! My mothe warned me this would happen ! Rita , she said , after 89 marriages you might wan na think about throwing in the towel . Why did n't I listen to her ? ! Zedd grumbles to himself .
ZEDD: That 's a good question . The stunned guard stirs his sleeping buddy .
MORDANT: Hey bonehead , get off my hoof !
ZEDD: After two thousand years of searching I have finally found you . Mordant BANGS on Goldar 's leg again .
MORDANT: Yo , earth to Bigfoot ! Goldar SWATS Mordant .
GOLDAR: Watch your mouth , fuzz-ball !
ZEDD: SILENCE !
GOLDAR: Mordant 's my second cousin three times removed on my mother 's side . He ` s just visiting for the summer .
RITA: Well put a muzzle on him !
ZEDD: Do n't you ever have anything nice to say ? !
RITA: Well , if I did I certainly would n't say it to you !
MORDANT: Boss .
ZEDD: For your information this is not just your average , run-of-the- mill tub of snot !
RITA: You 're trying to tell me there ` re different levels of snot ? !
MORDANT: Boss .
ZEDD: WHAT !
IVAN: Ahhhhhhhh .
RITA: He 's so cute .
ZEDD: I am Lord Zedd , sworn enemy of all that is good and decent . It is a supreme honor to finally meet you . Ivan gives a slight bow .
IVAN: How can I ever repay you ?
ZEDD: Do you recall the name Zordon of Eltare ?
MORDANT: Seems to ring a bell .
ZEDD: I want you to destroy Zordon , so that my evil may once again reign
RITA: Finally , a real man . Goldar hands Ivan a scrap of paper .
GOLDAR: Here 's his address . IVAN `` left off Interstate 12 ? ! '' What 's an `` interstate '' ?
MORDANT: It 's like a freeway . How long have you been locked up ? !
ZEDD: We shall leave you to weave you wicked ways .
RITA: Now we go out on the town . First dinner , then dancing , then BZZWAPP ! ! The foursome DE-MATERIALIZE .
IVAN: What is that odious stench ? His eyes come alive .
BILLY: Remind me to have a word with Alpha about his teleporting calculations .
AISHA: Anybody see anything ?
TOMMY: Let 's take a look over there .
SECURITY GUARD: You had me scared there .
AISHA: Makes two of us .
KIMBERLY: You have n't by any chance seen a morphological being lurking around ?
SECURITY GUARD: The only thing I 've seen is you teenagers . And you know if there 's one thing in the world I reeeeally hate .
IVAN: It 's TEENAGERS
KIMBERLY: GroSS !
IVAN: You 're too kind . Allow me to introduce myself . I am the infamous , world-reviled , universally despised , IVAN OOZE !
ROCKY: Well , pack your bags cause we 're sending you back where you came from !
IVAN: Gee , a teenager with a big mouth . Not much has changed in six thousand years .
KIMBERLY: we 're not just teenagers , raisin- head .
TOMMY: We 're the Mighty Morphin Powe Rangers ! Ivan puts his hands to his face in mock fear .
IVAN: Ooooh , where 's my autoqraph ook ? . He looks them over reproachfully .
ROCKY: He 's gone . The RATS ATTACK !
ADAM: Let 's take these beasts ! !
ZORDON: Alpha , my sensors tell me the Rangers were too late ! Ivan is on his way here !
ALPHA 5: Hey , NOBODY enters the Command Center without a power coin !
IVAN: Gee pretty fancy-shmancy . I guess if you invest your money well over SIXTY centuries you can uy something pretty nice .
ALPHA 5: HI , YAH !
ZORDON: You have n't changed , Ooze . You 're still picking on creatures smaller than yourself .
IVAN: Put a cork in it `` Z '' . Ten minutes out of the egg and I 'm already listening to one of you lectures .
ZORDON: It worked for six thousand years .
IVAN: Do n't remind me !
IVAN: it 's time to pay the PIPER !
IVAN: I 've got a NEWS flash for you

SABA: Na na na na na !
KIMBERLY: What 's going on ? ! Billy tries his wrist communicator .
BILLY: Alpha , come in ! There 's no response .
TOMMY: We 'd better get back .
ADAM: Guys ! The kids quickly uncover the battered robot .
BILLY: Alpha , are you okay ? !
ALPHA 5: I 'll GET you my pretty , and you little DOG toa ! !
BILLY: He must 've blown an anitromic demodulator ! KIMBERLY Oh , no
AISHA: What 's happening to him ? '
BILLY: Outside of his time warp he 's aging at a vastly acellerated ate !
KIMBERLY: We have to help him ! Zordon opens his eyes .
ZORDON: Rangers thank goodness you 're safe . The kids drop down beside him .
TOMMY: We have to get you back inside your time warp .
ZORDON: I 'm afraid that 's impossible The power has been destroyed . It 's gone The Zords , the weapons all of it . The Mighty Morphin Power Rangers are no more .
KIMBERLY: Zordon you ca n't leave us . Ever since you came into ou lives you 've been like anothe father ` to us all.-
ZORDON: You must be strong Ivan almost overthrew the planet once and now I 'm afraid he has the strength to see his scheme through .
BILLY: what 're we going to do ?
ALPHA 5: I do not LIKE Green Eggs and Ham ! I do not like them , Sam-I-am !
ADAM: There has to be something we can do .
TOMMY: Come on , guys , think ! Aisha turns to Alpha .
AISHA: Alpha . Is there any way we can defeat this monster ? Any way at all ?
ALPHA 5: Perhaps there is a way I have heard tales of anothe power .
ADAM: What ? !
ALPHA 5: They say that somewhere eyond the Hyperion Constellation there exists a mythological powe that is beyond all comprehension .
TOMMY: How can we get to it ?
ALPHA 5: As the legend goes , the power is impossible to obtain .
ROCKY: We have to try , Alpha . It 's ou only hope . Alpha shakes his head .
ALPHA 5: It 's far too dangerous . Zordon would never allow it .
AISHA: If we do n't try , Zordon wo n't survive !
ADAM: If Ivan Ooze is n't stopped , nobody will survive . Alpha heaves a sigh .
ALPHA 5: Ay , yi , yi , yi . The legend speaks of a Maste Warrior who lives on the planet Phaedos This is the only person who knows the secrets of the power .
AISHA: How can we reach Phaedos ? Alpha heaves a SIGH .
ALPHA 5: Zordon 's going to have my orbicular spheroids when he hears out about this !
ADAM: So how do we get back ? Alpha gives them a grim look .
ALPHA 5: You 'll have to pray that the legends are true . Alpha keys in coordinates .
TOMMY: It 's our only hope .
ALPHA: Safe journey , Rangers ! He pulls a lever .
ALPHA 5: Ay , yi , yi , yi . They 're DOOMED ! ! 23 thru 27 OMITTED

ZEDD: How dare you ? ! Nobody shuts up Rita but me !
IVAN: Sorry , slick , there 's been a slight'change of plans . The `` booger man '' is taking over . Ivan drops regally into Zedd 's chair .
ZEDD: Nobody double-crosses Lord Zedd and lives !
MORDANT: Zedd 's gon na kick this snotball into next week !
IVAN: Ooooh , that tickles !
RITA: This is all your fault ! If you 'd taken me out tonight like you were suposed to , none of this would 've happened . Ivan turns menacingly to Goldar and Mordant .
IVAN: Now you have a choice , eithe serve me , or join those insufferable cheesedongs .
GOLDAR: We never liked the cheesedongs in the first place .
MORDANT: Couldn '' t stand them low-class all the way . And did you catch a whiff of their BREATH ? ! It 's like having a conversation with a couple of ONIONS ! Not to mention
IVAN: Ah yes , the RANGERS ! ! !
MORDANT: Gasunteidt .
IVAN: SHUT YOUR BEAKS ! !
MORDANT: You know boss , I 'd really like to help out but I 've got this gastronomic condition which rules out all space trave

GOLDAR: You want me to place a few calls ? Ivan shakes his head .
IVAN: No need . I 'm going to use the young minds of Angel Grove .
GOLDAR: No offense , boss , but they might find you a little disgusting .
IVAN: Yes , well , I suppose you 'd know a little something about that . Not to worry . I 'll ever so gently lure them in and mold them into an army of devils ! And what etter way to entice them than with a little Ivan 's Ooze ? !
GOLDAR: But boss , what about thei parents ?

IVAN: Not so fast , greaseballs . Goldar blocks their way .
TOMMY: Hey . Kimberly glances up .
KIMBERLY: I was just thinking about Zordon everything we 've been through together .
AISHA: You know , meeting Zordon teaming up with you guys , it 's the best thing that 's eve happened to me .

ADAM: He 's gon na make it , guys . The others nod in agreement .
TOMMY: We 'll get this warrior save Zordon and send that SLIMEBALL Ivan Ooze back to the SEWER he crawled out of .
ROCKY: TAKE COVER !
KIMBERLY: THEY 'RE T00 STRONG ? ?
ADAM: WE NEED OUR POWERS ! !
MORDANT: WHAM ! KAPOW ! BOOM !
TOMMY: HANG ON , KIMBERLY .
MORDANT: What 's the matter with you woodpeckers ! Take this guy out !
KIMBERLY: Wow ! That was amazing for such a little dude ! The figure speaks in a HOARSE WHISPER .
FIGURE: You 're trespassing . Now state your business .

FIGURE: The Master Warrior does n't entertain visitors -
KIMBERLY: But we have to find him . Ou leader Zordon is dying .
FIGURE: Zordon ?
DULCEA: How did this happen ? !
KIMBERLY: The lady asked you a question .
TOMMY: Huh Oh , uh , we re , ah Kimberly intervenes .
KIMBERLY: He was attacked by this horrific eing Ivan Ooze .
DULCEA: Ivan Ooze is free ? ! We are all in mortal danger !
AISHA: Kind of bossy , is n't she ?
IVAN: Boys and girls , girls and boys , gather round and feast your eyes . This ai n't sludge and this ai n't guck this is the one and only Ivan 's Ooze ! Yesireebob . It 's ooey , gooey and even kind of chewy . But best of all it 's

SKULL: There 's enough for everybody ! Fred approaches .
FRED: So where 'd this guy come from ? Bulk and Skull exchange apprehensive looks .
SKULL: Uh that 's classified , top secret , confidential , undercove information .
BULK: If we told you we 'd have to kill you .
SKULL: INCOMING !
WIZARD: Come on , come all it 's an COZE
AISHA: Is this food !
DULCEA: They 're called squirbs .
KIMBERLY: Mine seems to be a little undercooked . Dulcea sprinkles hers with brown flakes .
DULCEA: Add a few dried weevils and you 'll never know the difference .
BILLY: Not bad .
TOMMY: Listen , we appreciate you hospitality , but we really do n't have much time . Dulcea looks to Tommy .
DULCEA: What do you know of the Great Power ?
KIMBERLY: Only that we need it to defeat Ivan Ooze . Dulcea 's eyes move from Ranger to Ranger .
DULCEA: It is said that to those who possess the Power all things are possible .
BILLY: Where did it originate ?
DULCEA: In another time , anothe dimension . It was brought here long ago by the `` Nathadians '' , a people who are now all but extinct . They built an impenetrable stone Monolith to store the power and keep it from their enemies . For thousands of years , beings from all over the Universe have tried to obtain it ALL have perished . Dulcea 's words hang heavily in the air .
AISHA: So how can we get to it ?
DULCEA: The only way to obtain the powe is to achieve the highest state of being
TOMMY: And how do we do that ?
DULCEA: By learning the ancient art of Ninjetti . It is the Genesis of what you on earth have come to know as the Ninja . It is the perfect union of mind , ody and spirit .
ROCKY: Look , Zordon does n't have much longer to live . And for all we know , Angel Grove could already e under attack . We do n't have TIME for this .
DULCEA: You do n't understand . If you do not have the Ninjetti , the powe will destroy you . To reach the Monolith we must traverse the Neola jungle . We will train today , and set out on foot tomorrow .
DULCEA: Snoggle , you watch your language ! Snoggle now re-fills Aisha 's tea-cup .
SNOGGLE: Slnughyu buglhugrmrph ?
AISHA: Excuse me ?
SNOGGLE: Slnughyu buglhugrmrph ?
DULCEA: He wants to know if you 'd like a cube of sugar in your tea .
AISHA: Ah sure .
BILLY: Not bad .
DULCEA: In the language of the Nathadians , `` Nin '' stands fo `` man '' , `` jetti '' stands fo `` animal '' . Ninjetti - man and animal , together as one . Now , put your hands inside the flame .
AISHA: Yeah , right .
DULCEA: It will not harm you .
AISHA: Just kidding .
DULCEA: Now tell me what do you see ?
AISHA: Stylin ' !
ROCKY: I see an Ape .

TOMMY: It 's an eagle ?
DULCEA: Look closer .
TOMMY: A falcon ?
DULCEA: Tommy , you are the Falcon , Winged Lord of the Sky . Kimberly regards Dulcea with true admiration .
DULCEA: I am the sole living descendant of the `` Nathadians '' . Now prepare yourselves for the most intense physical and mental training known to man and animal .
FRED: Dad ? ? ! He heaves a frustrated sigh .
KID #1: You seen my parents ?
FRED: I ca n't find my dad either .

WILD KID: Ooze , ooze , ooze rules ! !

DULCEA: The wolf relies on it 's enhanced senses to guide it He can hear what we can not hear , he can smell what we can not smell .
ADAM: Show off .
DULCEA: The bear is sturdy as a towering tree . Nothing can uproot it .
AISHA: Girl , you 've got to be kidding me .
DULCEA: The falcon never struggles with the air , but rather becomes one with it .
TOMMY: You can do this . You can do this . You can do this
ZORDON: Alpha , I am deeply concerned about the Rangers
ALPHA 5: I told them it was too dangerous , ut they would n't listen .
ZORDON: We must try to communicate with them .
ALPHA 5: Perhaps if I could locate a vertical-deflector then I could assemble a holographic-comlink .
ALPHA: Ay , yi , yi , yi , yi .
DULCEA: Each of you must reach deep within and draw upon your natural instincts Only then will you know the way of the Ninjetti . Rest for a few hours . We will continue at daybreak . She heads through the door .
KIMBERLY: So where are we supposed to sleep ? Snoggle points to the campfire .
SNOGGLE: Buhph nghujr .
KIMBERLY: That guy 's cruisin ' for a uisin ' .
BILLY: I can hardly walk
AISHA: I 've never been this sore in my life .
BILLY: Do you guys really think we can pull this off ? It takes a moment to get a response .
ADAM: Maybe if we had more time .
TOMMY: I wonder We 've been elying on our Morphin Powers fo so long maybe we 've forgotten how to rely on ourselves . There 's a somber silence .
IVAN: Ladies and gentlemen , Simon says STOP ! All the parents stop .
GOLDAR: Quack like a'duck !
IVAN: SHUT UP ! !
GOLDAR: You did n't say `` Simon says '' . IVAN Simon says SHUT UP ! ! !
IVAN: This is the Iast time I use parents for anything !
GOLDAR: Hey , boss !
MORDANT: What kind of landing was that ? ! These clowns are a menace to the sky
IVAN: How did you fare ? Mordant waves Ivan off .
MORDANT: Oh , it couldn't 've gone better . The Power Rangers did n't know what hit them .
IVAN: So they 've been destroyed ? The Tengu SQUAWKS some more .
MORDANT: `` Basically '' .
IVAN: What do you mean `` basically '' ?
MORDANT: Well we were about to finish them off when this huge monster came out of nowhere !
IVAN: Did these sticks make a whistling sound ?
MORDANT: How 'd you know ?
IVAN: Dulcea ! That miserable , manipulating loathsome she-devil of a WITCH ! !
MORDANT: What 're you talking about ? ! It was n't my fault ! You 're the featherbrains that let them get away ! Ivan looks up to the sky .
IVAN: I call upon the Powers of Darkness to enrich the evil of my creatures by tenfold !
MORDANT: Where does he come up with this stuff ?
IVAN: Queen Tengu , lead-your warriors to Phaedos , FEAST YOURSELVES UPON
SNOGGLE: BUGHU PHUNGL MURHPUGNU ! ! !
TOMMY: How the heck ? !
ROCKY: What 's going on ? !
KIMBERLY: I do n't believe it !
DULCEA: You have been visited by the animal spirits they have given you their blessing .
CROWD: OOZE ! OOZE ! OOZE ! OOZE !
IVAN: Thank you ! Please ! You 're too kind . Finally . a little appreciation where it 's deserved .

SKULL: Like we said before , that 's classified , top secret Fred decides to be tricky .
FRED: Look , Ivan wants me to go dump a load of garbage all over them .
BULK: Well , why did n't you say so ? !
SKULL: They 're at the World Cente Construction Site . Fred nods .
FRED: Uh . OOZE RULES !
TOMMY: Dulcea how do you and Zordon know each other ? Dulcea reminisces .
DULCEA: We belonged to an interstella Peace Keeping Force known as the `` Order of the Meledan '' . Zordon was widely regarded as the finest Commander in the Galaxy . He was a true Legend If it was n't for him , the Universe would be a very different place from what it is today .
ROCKY: So what happened ?
DULCEA: Over time our enemies were defeated I returned to Phaedos , Zordon moved on to continue the struggle elsewhere . Until you kids showed up , I had n't heard from him fo centuries . The Rangers are silent for a moment .
MORDANT: As soon as we 've taken over the world I 'm gon na change my name to Sir Mordant . Or how about MAJOR Mordant ? !
GOLDAR: How about Major Moron ?
IVAN: How about the two of you shut Up and pay attention ! !

ALPHA 5: By bouncing ultra-high frequencies off one of the network satellites , I can send a long-range pulsar signal to within TWO FEET of the Rangers coordinates .
ZORDON: I just pray we 're not too late . Alpha continues making adjustments .
ALPHA 5: Let 's give it a whirl .

BILLY: What 's a Triac ?
DULCEA: About twenty seconds in you time .
TOMMY: And how do we release the power ?
DULCEA: The legend goes that you release the power with the power .
ADAM: What does that mean !
DULCEA: That is a question that even I can not answer . Remember , ten triacs . After that something bad will happen .
KIMBERLY: Likehow bad ? Dulcea gives them a grim look .
DULCEA: They say the power will throw off a super-heated , radioactive fireball , instantly reducing you to ash and bits of charred bone . Aisha nods .
AISHA: That 's pretty bad .
TOMMY: Thank you , Dulcea . Fo everything .
DULCEA: Ka'Alabas tor nartu En'Kata-Tay . May your animals watch over you .

HARVEY MILK: Hello , I 'm Harvey Milk , and I 'm here to recruit you .
DIANNE FEINSTEIN: As President of the Board of Supervisors , it 's my duty to make this announcement . Both Mayo Moscone and Supervisor Harvey Milk have been shot and killed .
DAN WHITE: Something has happened .
HARVEY MILK: Knowing that I could be assassinated at any moment , I feel it 's important that some people should understand my thoughts . I think that I wish I had time to explain everything I did . Almost everything that was done was done with an eye on the gay movement .
SCOTT SMITH: Okay , Harvey
HARVEY MILK: Today 's my birthday . No , today is actually my birthday . Well , tonight . At midnight .
SCOTT SMITH: Really ?
HARVEY MILK: And , believe it or not , I do n't have any plans . People took me out after work
SCOTT SMITH: Work ? So , that would be Let me guess . Ma Bell or AT & T .
HARVEY MILK: The Great American Insurance Company . I 'm part of the big , evil , corporate establishment that , let me guess , you think is the cause of every evil thing in the world from Vietnam to diaper rash .
SCOTT SMITH: You left out bad breath .
HARVEY MILK: So You 're not going to let me celebrate my birthday all by myself are you ?
SCOTT SMITH: Listen , Harvey , you 're kind of cute for a suit But I do n't do guys over forty .
HARVEY MILK: Well then , I 'm in luck .
SCOTT SMITH: How 's that ?
HARVEY MILK: Because I 'm still thirty-nine And it 's only eleven-fifteen .
HARVEY MILK: Where are you from ?
SCOTT SMITH: Jackson , Mississippi .
HARVEY MILK: Well , this is n't Jackson , but you still ca n't respond to every strange man you meet on a subway platform . It 's too dangerous .
SCOTT SMITH: Now you tell me .
HARVEY MILK: There 's nothing tougher than a New York City cop . They 're arrogant , and they 're everywhere . I 'll show you the cruising spots , if you want , if you promise you 'll be careful little Scottie-san .
SCOTT SMITH: Are you on uppers or what ?
HARVEY MILK: No . This is just plain old me .
SCOTT SMITH: You 're afraid of the cops ?
HARVEY MILK: I 'm just discreet . I know a lot of people here . If they found out , I could lose my job .
SCOTT SMITH: Oh . You 're one of `` those . '' I think you need a change of scenery . New friends .
HARVEY MILK: I need a change .
SCOTT SMITH: You 're forty now .
HARVEY MILK: Forty years old and I have n't done a thing I 'm proud of .
SCOTT SMITH: You keep eating like this and you 'll be a fat ass by fifty .
HARVEY MILK: No . Do n't you worry . I wo n't make it to fifty .
SCOTT SMITH: Where to ?
HARVEY MILK: In those days , San Francisco was the place where everyone wanted to go To drop out To fall in love
SCOTT SMITH: I cashed my last unemployment check yesterday
HARVEY MILK: Well , I hope you did something useful with it .
SCOTT SMITH: I bought an ounce of pot . I was just wondering if you had any
HARVEY MILK: Do n't move .
SCOTT SMITH: I suppose I can wait tables .
HARVEY: No way . I want you right here with me Did you see place downstairs is for rent ?
SCOTT SMITH: Yeah .
HARVEY MILK: I was thinking we could open a shop together .
SCOTT SMITH: What kind of shop ?
HARVEY MILK: One with very little overhead . Not too much work A little one , just like Morris and Minnie Milk of Woodmere , New York
MCCONNELLY: You 're the new renters ?
HARVEY MILK: Yes . Welcome to Castro Camera .
MCCONNELLY: I do n't think your application will e approved , Mr . Milk . This is a family neighborhood . Your kind are far more welcome on Haight street .
HARVEY MILK: What `` kind '' do you mean , sir ?
MCCONNELLY: The Merchant 's Association will have the police pull your license if you open your doors .
SCOTT SMITH: Based on what law ?
MCCONNELLY: There 's man 's law and there 's God 's law in this neighborhood and in this City . The San Francisco Police force is happy to enforce either .
HARVEY MILK: Thanks for the warm welcome to the neighborhood !
SCOTT SMITH: We pay taxes you know !
HARVEY MILK: We 'll form our own business association ! Start with the gay- owned businesses We 'll take down the addresses of every customer that comes in for a roll of film . We 'll ask them what they want to see done here what they want changed We 'll get money rolling into this neighborhood . Revitalize it
SCOTT SMITH: Can I come in now ?
HARVEY MILK: I 'm a businessman , Scott . I think usinesses ought to treat thei customers right . Even their gay customers . For God 's sake , this is San Francisco !
SCOTT SMITH: Harvey . It 's just like every othe city in this country . People hate us . Big surprise .
HARVEY MILK: We should have at least one block in one city right ? Start there and take over the neighborhood . Okay , you can come in now !
SCOTT SMITH: Wow . This is
HARVEY MILK: Happy birthday !
MCCONNELLY: Fine .
HARVEY MILK: So you do n't mind all these homosexuals in here , do you ?
DANNY NICCOLETTA: Opera is passe , Harvey . It 's about street theater , now .
HARVEY MILK: What you 're not getting is the spectacle of it , the bigger than life emotions
SCOTT SMITH: Harvey This guy wants to talk to you .
HARVEY MILK: Welcome . What can we do for you ?
ALLAN BAIRD: Hi , I 'm Allan Baird . Teamsters epresentative , and Director of the Coors beer boycott in California .
HARVEY MILK: Everyone , this is Allan Baird . He 's a very big deal , so behave yourselves .
ALLAN BAIRD: I was told you were like the Mayo of the Castro , said you organized the CVA , you might know some people in the bars .
HARVEY MILK: I do have friends in awfully low places , but just so you know , it 's not official yet .
ALLAN BAIRD: What 's that ?
HARVEY MILK: The Mayor part . I 've considered gathering an army of queers to march up to City Hall and secede , ut so far the young gays seem more interested in jeeps and jeans . But if I could be of any use , I 'm all ears !
ALLAN BAIRD: We ca n't get Coors to go union . These guys are like me , they ca n't e out of work too long .
HARVEY MILK: I 'm just curious . Are we your first stop or your last ?
ALLAN BAIRD: It 's been a tough one , Mr . Milk .
HARVEY MILK: Well , you seem to have noticed that my kind of people drink a lot of eer . If we 're going to fast fo your sake , I think we should get to deliver some of it when you win this fight , do n't you ?
INCREDULOUS: Is that what you really want ?
HARVEY MILK: And allies . I 'll have Coors out of every bar in the Castro by the end of the week . Deal ?
ALLAN BAIRD: Thank you Mr . Milk .
HARVEY MILK: No more Coors beer . It 's got ta come out of every bar . Gay and straight .
SCOTT SMITH: What 's he giving you ?
HARVEY MILK: Nothing for me . That 's a convert .
SCOTT SMITH: A convert to what ?
HARVEY MILK: The cause .
COP: Clear the sidewalk !
HARVEY MILK: if we had someone in the government who saw things the way we see them , the way the black community has black leaders who look out for their interests
SCOTT SMITH: You 're gon na run for Supervisor , is that the idea ?
SARCASTIC: Because I have so much experience in politics .
HARVEY MILK: Politics is theater . It does n't matter if you win . You make a statement . You say , `` I 'm here , pay attention to me . ''
SCOTT SMITH: Harvey , you do that every time you cross the street .
HARVEY MILK: Coors looks like it might cave . The union boys will owe me . Imagine if we get their vote It 'll be fun !
SCOTT SMITH: Fun ? Harvey starts kissing him all over .
HARVEY MILK: We 'll make it a spectacle .
HARVEY MILK: Public dental care for retired people Legalize pot , vote Milk .
LAUGHS: Sorry old man , not interested .
HARVEY MILK: Where 's home ?
CLEVE JONES: Phoenix .
HARVEY MILK: I 'm Harvey Milk . I 'm running fo Supervisor . What 's your name ?
CLEVE JONES: Cleve Jones .
HARVEY MILK: Well Mr. Jones , we should walk up to my camera shop and register you .
CLEVE JONES: Fuck that . Elections of any kind are a bourgeois affectation .
HARVEY MILK: Is that right ? Do you trick up on Polk Street ?
CLEVE JONES: If I need the cash But I 'm selective about my clients .
HARVEY MILK: Tell me one thing before you get ack to work then . What was it like to be a little queer in Phoenix ?
CLEVE JONES: I faked a lung disease to get out of PE . So what ? What are you , some kind of street shrink ?
HARVEY MILK: Sometimes . But what I 'm saying is , Phoenix can change . But we have to start with our street rent control , police abuse , pot , parks , seniors .
CLEVE JONES: Well , good luck with all that .
HARVEY MILK: You know what I think , Cleve Jones ?
CLEVE JONES: That you 're gon na get somewhere if you keep talking ?
HARVEY MILK: No . That you need to do what you 're good at . Be a prick . Fight City Hall . Fight the cops . Fight the people who made you come here to do what you do .
CLEVE JONES: Sorry old man , I 'm leaving fo Spain tomorrow . Europe . Got all the cash I need in my back pocket .
HARVEY MILK: look up to , no hope for a bette life . Those that did were outcast arrested.. suicide . And the young ones , who did escape home and who arrive in San Francisco , and then what
COP: The “ fruit ” was walking home with his “ trick ” when they were jumped .
HARVEY MILK: He used to come into my shop . Are there any witnesses ?
COP: Just the `` trick . '' Jerry Taylor .
HARVEY MILK: Jerry was n't a trick . They were lovers .
COP: Call it what you will . He 's ou only witness and he says he ca n't identify the attackers .
HARVEY MILK: There 'd be a dozen witnesses if they thought you boys had any real interest in keeping them safe .
COP: You 're the Mayor of Castro Street now , right Harvey ? You really wan na help ? Get your people to show some discretion on the streets , huh ?
JIM RIVALDO: Well , it looks like the big guns and the rich gays in San Francisco are going to back Dianne Feinstein and other straight candidates they consider `` gay-friendly . ''
SCOTT SMITH: Who cares about those old queens ? Scott is laying down on THE BIG RED COUCH .
HARVEY MILK: Why is n't my campaign manage leading the meeting ?
SCOTT SMITH: I 'm beat , Harvey . I passed out flyers for seven hours straight .
HARVEY MILK: In the bathhouse ?
SCOTT SMITH: People in bathhouses vote . I 'm tired . I 'm taking a nap . Scott heads up the stairs to their apartment .
HARVEY MILK: Just checking the exposure . That a new boyfriend ? He 's very cute .
CUSTOMER: Um Thanks , Harvey .
HARVEY MILK: So who are these so-called `` gay leaders ? '' And who appointed them ? And what are you suggesting , Jim , that I 'm supposed to go and solicit their endorsement ?
HARVEY MILK: We 're down here , on the streets , trying to help people , so where they hell are they ?
DICK PABICH: David Goodstein is the publisher of The Advocate and he has a house
JIM RIVALDO: A mansion
DICK PABICH: in Atherton .
THELMA: Harvey , you should read this .
SCOTT SMITH: `` Harvey Milk will have a dream journey and nightmare to hell , a night of horror . You will be stabbed and have your genitals , cock , balls , prick cut off . ''
BEAT: I 'm calling the police .
HARVEY MILK: They probably wrote it . Hey , If somebody tries to kill me , I 'll get the sympathy vote , right ? Could be just the push we need .
SCOTT SMITH: You think this is funny ? Look at it .
HARVEY MILK: It 's a complete joke . No rhythm . No humor . It 's insulting .
SCOTT SMITH: Do n't do that .
HARVEY MILK: If you put it away , hide it in a drawer , it 'll just get bigger and scarier . Now it 's there . We 'll see it every day . It ca n't get us .
SCOTT SMITH: All this energy to make yourself a target . And what for ? Something we have no chance to win . Harvey wraps his arms around him .
HARVEY MILK: I keep telling you , it 's not just about winning .
DAVID GOODSTEIN: I worked for a financial institution . I was very discreet . But someone spotted me at the opera , sitting in a box , next to my lover . And I was fired . That 's when I decided to do something . So I bought The Advocate . And I use my money and my influence in quiet ways , to do what I can
HARVEY MILK: Endorsing straight candidates is what you think is best to help us ?
DAVID GOODSTEIN: Yes , if they 're friendly to ou cause .
DEFENSIVE: Politics is complicated in San Francisco , and Supervisor is a citywide office . Political alliances need to be built . You ca n't simply move here from across the country and run for office .
HARVEY MILK: But I am running for office . I 'm on the ballot . I have the union rank and file , the seniors , and I could use your magazine 's endorsement .
DAVID GOODSTEIN: Harvey , we 're like the Catholic church . We welcome converts , but we do n't make them Pope the same day .
HARVEY MILK: And why have n't you run ?
DAVID GOODSTEIN: It 's too early for a gay candidate for Supervisor . Especially one from the Castro . It 's bad for the community 's image .
SCOTT SMITH: What 's wrong with the Castro ?
DAVID GOODSTEIN: Nobody works there . It 's all sex and drugs and more sex and no one taking responsibility for their own problems .
HARVEY MILK: The cops come into our neighborhood and beat us . They turn a blind eye if one of us is murdered .
RICK STOKES: Then we file a lawsuit against the city . We go to our political allies in City Hall
HARVEY MILK: There are no real gay allies . Yes , our friends may sense our struggle , ut they ca n't feel it . It 's not life or death for them . We need ou own in office .
RICK STOKES: You ca n't demand acceptance overnight .
HARVEY MILK: Why not ? How can we ask them to espect us if we do n't show ourselves some self respect , David .
DAVID GOODSTEIN: The more “ out ” you make us , the more you incite them . Step back and quiet down .
HARVEY MILK: Go back into the closet ? Is that what you 're saying ? Because I know the closet . I lived in it for more years than I care to remember . I do n't need your endorsement . I 'm not asking anyone for acceptance . I do n't have time to ask .
DAVID GOODSTEIN: For you , politics is a game , a lark . Like putting on a rock festival or staging a `` love-in . '' You 're too old to be a hippie , Harvey Milk ! Harvey turns around , ready for a fight .
HARVEY MILK: I 'm not a candidate , I 'm part of a movement . The movement is the candidate . There 's a difference . You do n't see the difference . But I do .
SCOTT SMITH: Thanks for the swim . I 'm sorry I pissed in your pool .
HARVEY MILK: So I went for it again in '75 with just a few minor adjustments .
SCOTT SMITH: No . Not cute . The shoes are hideous and I hate your hair . You 're not fooling anybody .
HARVEY MILK: I 'm not gon na let the Pacific Heights biddies write me off again ecause of a ponytail . I like it .
LILY: No , no . You wo n't run into the owner . He died in that suit .
SCOTT SMITH: This is n't sexy , Harvey . Harvey grabs Scott , kisses him . Then playful
HARVEY MILK: Too bad . No more pot , no more bath houses for me and little poo .
HARVEY MILK: It 's a racket . It 's 1976 and you still have to be straight , white , Catholic and male to get into the San Francisco police force . It 's Racist . Homophobic .
ART AGNOS: How many people do you conside enemies , Harvey ? I 've counted five already .
HARVEY MILK: You 're right , Art . And many are your closest friends . You see , I do n't think State Assembly seats should be awarded on the basis of service to the Democrat Machine . Machines operate on oil and grease . They 're dirty , dehumanizing , and too often unresponsive to any needs ut those of the operator .
ART AGNOS: Mr . Milk , I 've worked for years as a social worker in this city . I know Sacramento . I know how to get done what we all need done there .
HARVEY MILK: Tell me Mr. Agnos right here in the Castro , Robert Hillsbourough was murdered for walking home with his long time partner . Stabbed ,
ART AGNOS: You know Harv ' , your whole rap 's a eal downer .
HARVEY MILK: My God , you 're handsome up close . I ca n't tell you how much I 'm looking forward to licking you in the polls .
LAUGHS: You talk a lot about what you 're against . What are you for ? In this town , you got ta give em ' a reason for optimism or you 're cooked .
SCOTT SMITH: Harvey . Dinner .
HARVEY: get some union boys in the audience , they love me
JIM RIVALDO: I ca n't control who 's in the audience
SCOTT SMITH: Harvey , you need to eat something . Now .
SCOTT: If you say one thing about politics or your campaign or where you 're speaking tonight or whose endorsement you need I 'll sta you with my fork I swear to God .
HARVEY: I just wanted to say This is the most delicious meal I 've eve eaten in my entire life .
HARVEY MILK: If we lose this one , it 'll be just me and you again . I promise .
CLEVE JONES: You staying up with me ?
HARVEY MILK: The election 's tomorrow . I wo n't sleep Was he good looking ?
CLEVE JONES: No . He was hideous .
HARVEY MILK: Hard to tell what 's worse . With me , my boyfriends usually find bette looking ones to cheat with .
CLEVE JONES: I thought we were gon na spend the est of our lives together .
HARVEY MILK: Guess what , Cleve Jones .
CLEVE JONES: What ?
HARVEY MILK: You 're going to meet the most extraordinary men , the sexiest , ightest , funniest men , and you 're going to fall in love with so many of them , and you wo n't know until
CLEVE JONES: Is that supposed to help ?
HARVEY MILK: Maybe a little . Or not .
CLEVE JONES: I went to Spain last month long story . In Barcelona , there was this memorial march for gay people who died under Franco . The police tried to break it up . It started a riot . A bullet ripped through a drag queens scalp , his wig flew off , but he kept fighting . There was blood literally running in the gutter .
HARVEY MILK: We could have a revolution here too . But you ca n't just use the Castro to cruise . You got ta fight .
CLEVE JONES: You think you 'll win ?
HARVEY MILK: Winning is n't my strong suit .
BRAVADO: Well , I do n't `` do '' losing . Ever . Maybe I should run for office , and you can work for me . If you can do it , I can do it .
HARVEY MILK: Can you assemble a thousand people in an hour ?
CLEVE JONES: Yeah , sure .
HARVEY MILK: All right , if I run again , you 're my man .
CLEVE JONES: If ?
HARVEY MILK: Polls open in 3 hours . Lets hit the us stops .
JIM RIVALDO: We lost , but we lost by less ! More votes than ever I remember when that used to work . I want to show you something . This is remarkable .
HARVEY MILK: I do n't know if I have another one in me . Or Scott .
TV REPORTER: Gays in Florida can now be removed from their jobs and prosecuted if their `` deviant '' lifestyles are uncovered .
HARVEY MILK: Scottie ?
BOY'S VOICE: I 'm sorry sir . I um I read about you in the paper .
HARVEY MILK: I 'm sorry . I ca n't talk right
BOY'S VOICE: Sir , I think I want to kill myself .
HARVEY MILK: No . You do n't want to do that .
BEAT: Where do you live ?
BOY'S VOICE: In Minnesota .
HARVEY MILK: You saw me in a paper in Minnesota ? How 'd I look ?
BOY'S VOICE: My folks are taking me to this place tomorrow . A hospital . To fix me .
HARVEY MILK: There 's nothing wrong with you . Listen to me . You do n't have to hurt yourself , okay ? Are you there ? Here 's what you have to do . Are you listening ?
BOY'S VOICE: Yes .
HARVEY MILK: Get on a bus . Go to the next iggest city . New York , San Francisco , LA , or even Minneapolis . It does n't matter . Just leave . You wo n't be alone . There are people out here just like you who will welcome you and love you .
BOY'S VOICE: I ca n't .
HARVEY MILK: Yes . You can . Just get on a bus .
BOY'S VOICE: I ca n't I ca n't walk , sir . I 'm in a wheelchair Sir . Are you there ? Harvey FORCES HIMSELF TO SOUND CALM
HARVEY MILK: That 's okay . It 's going to be okay .
DICK PABICH: Harvey , you better come down . There 's gon na be a riot .
CLEVE JONES: Out of the bar and into the streets ! Anita Bryant is coming after you !
POLICEMAN: If you ca n't control em ' , we will .
HARVEY MILK: Give me permission to march them .
POLICEMAN: Where ?
HARVEY MILK: Anywhere .
CLEVE JONES: Yes . Where are we going ?
HARVEY MILK: I do n't know . We have to keep them moving . Exhaust them . March them till they drop . We ca n't have a riot tonight .
DICK PABICH: They 're still too hot in back . They 'll burn the joint down .
HARVEY MILK: Help me turn them up Van Ness . We 'll go all the way to Broadway .
HARVEY MILK: Hope for the worker who awakens from the American dream to find that all the jobs have left the country We got ta give em ' HOPE !
DAN WHITE: I 'm not going to be forced out of San Francisco by splinter groups of social radicals , social deviants , and incorrigibles . You must realize there are thousands upon thousands of frustrated , angry people such as yourselves waiting to unleash a fury that will eradicate the malignancies which blight ou eautiful city .
HARVEY MILK: Evelyn Lear 's in town , at the Opera house in Tannhauser .
SCOTT SMITH: Clearly .
HARVEY MILK: What if she strolls into the Castro for a cocktail ? Just one more . We ca n't let Rick Stokes take it .
SCOTT SMITH: Let Rick have it . Nobody thinks you 're a fraud here , Harvey . You 're not in New York , you 're not a closet case asshole anymore . People espect you here . Relax for a year . Get us back on our feet .
HARVEY MILK: If people are ever going to take me seriously , I have to win this one .
SCOTT SMITH: Since when did you care if anyone took you seriously ?
HARVEY MILK: Anita wants to put us all back in concentration camps . Rick Stokes is too weak to beat her back if she gets to California . I have to be in office to protect us from them .
SCOTT SMITH: I ca n't do another one . I 'll be back for my sheets . If you 're not here , I 'll see you in the shop next week .
HARVEY MILK: If you leave me right now I can find someone new .
SCOTT SMITH: I know . You 're a catch .
HARVEY MILK: Ring out the old , ring in the new . This is over . Done . I do n't want to see anything that say 's fucking Assembly . This three-time loser faggot is running fo Supervisor goddamn it !
JIM RIVALDO: Who the heck is she ?
HARVEY MILK: Our new campaign manager . She called last week to volunteer and I asked her to help .
DICK PABICH: Help or take over ? What about Scott ?
HARVEY MILK: We need new blood .
ANNE KRONENBERG: Hi guys . Mr . Milk Rick Stokes is n't pulling out . He 's officially filed to run against you . My friend at The Advocate says David Goodstein is backing him .
MICHAEL WONG: A gay candidate against a gay candidate . It 's unfortunate .
JIM RIVALDO: They 'll split the gay vote . The straights will divide and conquer .
HARVEY MILK: Try to find out when they 're going to announce .
DICK PABICH: You replaced Scott with a lesbian ?
HARVEY MILK: Anne worked on a recycling campaign up North . She 's very organized .
JIM RIVALDO: How do you know she 's not a plant from Rick Stokes ' campaign ?
ANNE KRONENBERG: Are you guys always this paranoid ?
MICHAEL WONG: Yes . They take after Harvey .
HARVEY MILK: Should n't you be doing someone 's laundry ?
MICHAEL WONG: Right after you redecorate my house .
ANNE KRONENBERG: Sir , my girlfriends say you guys do n't like women . Just asking , is there a place for us in all this , or are you scared of girls ?
HARVEY MILK: Gentleman , we already have a tinke ell , a lotus-blossom , Jim and Dick in your three-piece suits . We need someone to manage things . A woman this time . She 's the right price , and she has bigger balls than any of you .
ANNE KRONENBERG: Just give me whatever 's left over in the register at the end of the day . So should I call the Chronicle about getting US an endorsement ? No ?
RICK STOKES: Young lady , you must be confused . This is my night , not Mr . Milk 's .
ANNE KRONENBERG: No , sir . I 'm Harvey 's new campaign manager . Anne Kronenberg .
RICK STOKES: Then you should know this race is for District 5 , the Castro , not fo all of your lesbian compadres
ANNE KRONENBERG: I 'm sorry . Are we distracting you , Mr. Stokes ? I 'd hate to screw you up on your big night .
DICK PABICH: Hi Rick , handsome suit . Annie , do you have any more hand cards ?
RICK STOKES: These people are not from this area . They need to leave . Now .
DICK PABICH: Not true . Guess where we found them all , Rick ? A slew of them . Way up on Valencia Street . Living right there in our district . And you see , as it turns out , Annie here is very , very popular with the ladies .
HARVEY MILK: They 've accused me of many things , ut never as blatant a lie as this .
ANNE KRONENBERG: First ever newspaper endorsement .
CLEVE JONES: They endorsed you for being a good usinessman ? Has Scott read this ? He 'll piss himself .
HARVEY MILK: Yeah ? Go show him .
CLEVE JONES: I 'm going to The Stud . Meet me out .
GAY MAN: Gon na win this time , Milk ? They walk on , not waiting for an answer .
JACK LIRA: You 're more handsome in the posters .
HARVEY MILK: Thank you . Where do you live ?
JACK LIRA: Palomino 's are my favorite horse . They 're smart . They 're fast and compact . Do you think I 'm more like a Palomino or a Stallion ?
HARVEY: Shh , it 's okay , now . No one 's eve going to beat you again . A long , comforting beat between them .
JACK LIRA: I love you .
HARVEY: Do you even remember my name ? Harvey .
JACK LIRA: I love you , Harvey .
RICK STOKES: We just want to congratulate him .
CLEVE JONES: I 'm sorry . We 're all full .
DAVID GOODSTEIN: Harvey ! Harvey !
HARVEY MILK: It 's too crowded . Sorry ! JACK LIRA shoves his way toward the door
JACK LIRA: Harvey !
HARVEY MILK: Scottie ?
CLEVE JONES: The new Mrs . Milk . I give it a week .
JACK LIRA: Harvey , is this all for you ? Are you this famous ?
HARVEY MILK: No , darling . We do this all the time . Do you like it ?
JIM RIVALDO: Carol Ruth Silver Gordon Lau It 's the most liberal Board in years !
HARVEY MILK: What about Dan White ? Did he win ?
YES: We 'll deal with him tomorrow . Harvey is DOUSED with champagne .
HARVEY MILK: I have to be . That 's what I was elected for . I have to be there to open up the dialogue for the sensitivities of all people , all their problems , the problems that effect this city effect all of us . Thank you San Francisco ! Thank you !
DAN WHITE: A couple of years .
HARVEY MILK: And before that You were a police officer ?
DAN WHITE: You have something against cops ?
HARVEY MILK: No . They tend to have something against me .
DAN WHITE: I appreciate it .
HARVEY MILK: I meant what I said . I 'd like to work together .
DAN WHITE: I 'll see you at the office , Mr . Milk .
HARVEY MILK: What do you think of my new theater ?
CLEVE JONES: A bit over the top .
HARVEY MILK: What 's with the suit ?
CLEVE JONES: I got it from a friend .
HARVEY MILK: When you come here , I want you to wear the tightest jeans possible . Never blend in . And no elevators . Ever . Always take the stairs , you can make such a grand entrance going up the stairs .
ANNE KRONENBERG: Will do .
HARVEY MILK: Come into my office
MICHAEL WONG: I think it 's good . Not great .
HARVEY MILK: Then make it brilliant . I want Anita 's attention here . In San Francisco . I want her to bring he fight to US This Bill needs a unanimous vote . We need headlines .
JIM RIVALDO: Dan White wo n't vote for this .
HARVEY MILK: Dan 's fine . He 's just uneducated . We can teach him . Dan pops his head into Harvey 's office .
DAN WHITE: Harvey , committee meets at 9 30 . Oh , hi Michael , Jim . Hey , did you get the invitation to
HARVEY MILK: I 'll be there .
DAN WHITE: Great !
ANNE KRONENBERG: Are you going ?
HARVEY MILK: Hey . I 'll let him christen me , if he 'll vote for my Gay Rights Ordinance . We need allies . We need everyone .
HARVEY: Jack ?
JACK LIRA: Welcome home , Harvey ! I hope you 're hungry . I only know how to cook one thing , but I make it good .
HARVEY: Did you break in ?
JACK LIRA: I asked the boy downstairs to let me in
HARVEY: Danny ?
JACK LIRA: He would n't let me in . So I came in this way . Your friends are n't very nice to me .
HARVEY: I have a Town Hall meeting tonight , Jack .
JACK LIRA: You work too hard . I 'm sorry about your window . I 'll fix it tomorrow . Are you surprised ? !
HARVEY MILK: Jack , I have to go . I have an invitation to a party tomorrow . Lots of rich people , politicians . We could get all dressed up
JACK LIRA: So I could be the first lady ?
HARVEY MILK: Uh-huh .
JACK LIRA: I watched TV here today . All day . I saw All My Children . They killed Margo . I knew it was going to happen . They try and trick you but it never works .
HARVEY MILK: You always see it coming ?
JACK LIRA: What ? Killing the blonde ? Every time . I 'm good with that . I think now the old lady is going to have an affair . Then she 'll get killed or married . Always one o the other . Dead or married .
HARVEY MILK: If I make you a key , you wo n't eak my windows again , right ?
JACK LIRA: That 's right .
HARVEY MILK: I 'm proposing a citywide ordinance . It ensures that a person who already has a job ca n't be fired for their orientation .
DAN WHITE: I 'm not sure my constituents would favor that . Dan looks over to his WIFE and NEWBORN SON .
HARVEY MILK: Is anyone else here from the Board ?
DAN WHITE: You 're the only one who showed up I think .
HARVEY MILK: Were you christened here ?
DAN WHITE: Yes . Right here . Same Parish . My grandma immigrated here when this was an Irish Catholic city . The City of St. Francis A lot 's changed here since then .
HARVEY MILK: You 're more like one of us now an outsider .
DAN WHITE: You 're not like most homosexuals , are you , Harvey ?
HARVEY MILK: Do you know a lot of `` homosexuals ? ''
DAN WHITE: Say , where do you stand on the Psychiatric Center the City 's been pushing into my district ?
HARVEY MILK: Well , I 'd have to study it
DAN WHITE: Getting it out of my district was a key piece of my platform . It only attracts arsonist , rapists , all that , you know .
HARVEY MILK: Sure , sure . A campaign promise .
DAN WHITE: A big one .
QUIET: What do you say we watch out for each other 's interests ? I 'd like that .
HARVEY MILK: I 'd like that , too , Dan .
DAN WHITE: I 'm sorry . Slipped into some shop talk .
HARVEY MILK: The Gay Rights Ordinance . My fault .
DICK PABICH: Supervisors Silver and Lau are asking you to vote to keep this Psychiatric Center in Dan 's district . It 'll go down 6 to 5 if you vote to get rid of it .
MICHAEL WONG: It 's a Youth Campus , Harvey . These are kids that would be displaced from their families if it 's moved .
HARVEY MILK: I ca n't just dump Dan . The guy 's got nothing going for him . No friends
CLEVE JONES: Here we go , Harvey to the rescue . Is n't it enough we have to put up with Jack ?
HARVEY MILK: Lay off . He registered 120 voters last week .
CLEVE JONES: So do any of your volunteers , but you do n't make them all first lady .
MICHAEL WONG: What does Dan White do for you ? Really ? Politically ?
HARVEY MILK: He intrigues me I think he may e one of us . Everyone groans . Cleve camps it up
CLEVE JONES: Dear God , say it ai n't so !
HARVEY MILK: It 's just a theory
DICK PABICH: You just think he 's cute .
HARVEY MILK: No I know what it 's like to live that life . That lie . You can see it in Dan 's eyes The fear , the pressure
ANNE KRONENBERG: Not great . State Senator John Briggs is Anita Bryant 's go-to guy in California for sure . He 's filed his petition for a statewide eferendum to fire all gay teachers and anyone who supports them .
HARVEY MILK: How many signatures will he need to qualify for the ballot ?
CLEVE JONES: Whatever . He can get them in two Sundays at church in Orange County .
HARVEY MILK: This means the fight 's coming here , where we can do something about it ! Wichita 's one thing , Kansas City . But Anita 's heading for San Francisco ! She 's not going to know what hit her . Smile , children ! This is the fight we 've been waiting for .
JOHN BRIGGS: My proposition promises to protect our children from these gay perverts and pedophiles who recruit our children to their deviant lifestyles , including the ones who
TOM AMMIANO: And how are you going to determine who 's a homosexual ?
JOHN BRIGGS: Sir , my bill outlines procedures for identifying homosexuals .
ANOTHER PROTESTER: How ? Will you be sucking them off ?
JOHN BRIGGS: Sir , you can argue with me , but you can not argue with God .
DAVID GOODSTEIN: Hello , Harvey . Running late ?
HARVEY MILK: Excuse me , David ?
QUIETLY: The Latino , he 's locked himself in the coat room Mr . Milk , Phil Burton is here . He 's likely the next Speaker of the House and a much needed ally against Prop Six . We do n't need a scene .
HARVEY MILK: You 're right , I know , I was late by twenty minutes . I 'm sorry , Jack .
DAVID GOODSTEIN: The Briggs initiative is polling at 75 percent for approval statewide .
CLEVE JONES: 80 percent in other polls . Some even have us losing San Francisco .
DAVID GOODSTEIN: So it 's important we not deceive people into thinking we can beat this , or we 'll have riots and only increase this backlash .
HARVEY JONES: Good point , David . Let 's just roll ight over . Make it easier fo Briggs to fuck us up the ass .
PHIL BURTON: We 're taking this very seriously in my office . We want to send one of these to every home in California . We 'll need money to do that .
HARVEY MILK: `` Proposition Six is an affront to Human Rights . An invasion of the State into the private lives of California citizens . '' Does it even say the word gay on this thing ? Anywhere ?
DAVID GOODSTEIN: No Harvey , purposefully not .
PHIL BURTON: With the heat bearing down on you movement right now , we think it 's est to dodge the `` gay '' bullet . Go for the human rights angle .
HARVEY MILK: People need to know who 's affected . This flier needs at least one old queen on it . Why do n't you volunteer for that , David ?
RICK STOKES: Corey Wares is an out gay
HARVEY MILK: This is shit . Shit and masturbation . It 's a coward 's esponse to a dangerous threat .
DAVID GOODSTEIN: I think you should leave .
HARVEY MILK: Jack , it 's time to go . Get everyone together . I want young people , women , fresh heads . Fighters and organizers , not politicians .
CLEVE JONES: What about , S-C-O-T-T ?
JIM RIVALDO: But we ca n't afford infighting anymore , Cleve . We have to bring together every group . Even the old school Democrats .
HARVEY MILK: Is anybody gon na pay the pizza guy , or are we just gon na stare ?
DICK PABICH: `` Come out , come out , wherever you are ! ''
HARVEY MILK: I 'm serious . We 're going to tell everyone in the state to come out . Every gay doctor , lawyer , teacher , dog catcher We have to leave the ghetto , let all those people out there know that they do know one of us . And if people wo n't step out of the closet , we open the door for them .
ANNE KRONENBERG: Jesus .
SCOTT SMITH: The whole state is not San Francisco .
HARVEY MILK: Clearly , Scott .
JIM RIVALDO: It could be dangerous . There is such a thing as a right to privacy .
HARVEY MILK: Privacy 's our enemy . You want real political power ? Let 's tell the truth for a change . Starting here . If there 's anybody in this room , ight now , who has n't told thei families , their friends , thei employers Do it . Now .
ANNE KRONENBERG: My folks know already . A beat . The room is silent . Dick looks ill .
DICK PABICH: I have n't told my father yet
HARVEY MILK: People vote two to one for us if they know just one of us .
BEAT: Cleve , show Dick where you keep your phone .
CLEVE JONES: It 's in the bedroom .
HARVEY MILK: I thought you were done with politics .
SCOTT SMITH: Politics . Not the movement . What the hell was that in there ?
HARVEY MILK: The movement needs people to be up- front . Why were you fighting me ?
SCOTT SMITH: You were the biggest closet case alive in New York . You told me and all your boyfriends to keep ou
HARVEY MILK: My parents are gone . My brothe knows . I 'm sure they knew .
SCOTT SMITH: I had to listen to your phone calls home to Mom . Hear you deny that I existed . You want to be `` normal '' as ad as any of us . More than any of us Those are kids in there . You 're asking them to lose thei families .
HARVEY MILK: If their families wo n't love them for who they are , who they really are , then they should lose them .
SCOTT SMITH: That 's fucking insane .
HARVEY MILK: Who 's he ? Do you live together ?
SCOTT SMITH: Someone I 'm seeing . He 's good fo me . He makes me stay home at nights , out of the bars
HARVEY MILK: I miss you .
SCOTT SMITH: Oh , Harvey , do n't What 's that about ?
JACK LIRA: Har-veyyyyy !
HARVEY MILK: He needs me .
DIANNE FEINSTEIN: Duly noted . We will take a recess efore recording the vote .
DAN WHITE: Can I have a moment with Harvey ? Alone , please , Carol ?
HARVEY MILK: I did n't have all the details . I 'll help you craft a different version that does n't displace any kids .
DAN WHITE: Harvey , I ca n't go back to my family and to my folks and to my district without this . Do n't do this .
HARVEY MILK: I 'm getting a lot of pressure , Dan .
DAN WHITE: You strung me along . And now you 're throwing me to the wolves .
HARVEY MILK: You only need one more vote , Dan . There are 5 other Supervisors you could convince besides me .
DAN WHITE: I 'll vote against your Queer Law . I 'll get Quentin against it .
HARVEY MILK: It 'll still pass . You ca n't keep alienating yourself here , Dan .
DAN WHITE: I gave you a chance , Harvey . I eally did . You blew it . You really lew it .
HARVEY MILK: Across the country , a handful of city councils had passed the very first ordinances protecting gay people against discrimination . But Anita Bryant and her right wing Christian fundamentalists were creating and exploiting and fanning a backlash . Now she had referenda to repeal all of these gay rights ordinances . While we were preparing for the battle against Briggs and Prop Six , Anita Bryant was taking her show on the road sweeping the country . Her next stop was Wichita , Kansas .
ANITA BRYANT: I give thanks for all of our foot soldiers of God here in Wichita . But we must push on . Look what happened to Sodom and to the world of Noah . Onward Christian soldiers !
BRIGGS'S: On to California !
CLEVE JONES: Hi . We 're losing Wichita . Rally tonight . Sundown . Market and Castro .
HARVEY MILK: Did Jim call the press ? Get out there with your camera !
DANNY NICCOLETTA: I 'm going !
CLEVE JONES: Press is covered . But we do n't have a permit to march .
HARVEY MILK: When I got Coors out of the bars , the Union gave me this . I want you to have it .
CLEVE JONES: What do I do with this ?
HARVEY MILK: You 're an activist . Take it . March them . March those people up to the front doors of City Hall . When it looks eally bad , the city 's first gay Supervisor will come out and play peacemaker . We save the city from a iot . We can turn this night into more political power for the cause .
CLEVE JONES: I ca n't do it like you do it .
HARVEY MILK: I wo n't always be here . Somebody else will have to take over . I need you to be the scary one now .
CLEVE JONES: Forty years ago tonight , the gay citizens of Germany found out they no longer had civil rights . Tomorrow morning , the gay citizens of Wichita will also awaken to find that they too have lost their civil ights . You have whistles . You use them when we have been attacked . Tonight we have been attacked .
JIM RIVALDO: What are you doing ? Where 's Harvey ?
CLEVE JONES: We 're shutting down traffic , both directions .
HARVEY MILK: Hello . My name is Harvey Milk , and I want to recruit you . I want to recruit you for the fight to preserve our democracy against the Anita Bryants and John Briggs who are trying to legalize bigotry ! We have a choice to make . The fight is at our doors . We must either go ack in the closet and shut it tight , or fight History shows
CLEVE JONES: They 're calling it a `` successful mediation . '' You 're a God damn hero . Fuck . It came this close to a riot .
HARVEY: Lose the note cards next time . You job is just to say into that ullhorn what they 're all feeling .
CLEVE JONES: You 're just jealous it was n't you out there .
HARVEY MILK: We 're losing Prop Six by 60 % and you 're over there celebrating a iot . I need more visibility If we 're going to beat this thing , we have to get Briggs to acknowledge us .
ANNE KRONENBERG: Every paper 's calling Prop Six the main event now . We lose this , we 'll have anti-gay laws in all fifty states , and Briggs wo n't return ou calls for a public debate .
DICK PABICH: He 's ignoring us to death .
HARVEY MILK: We need something populist . What 's the number one complaint about city life ?
CLEVE JONES: The piss smell in the Tenderloin .
HARVEY MILK: Close .
FRANK ROBINSON: Dog shit .
JIM RIVALDO: If you cleaned up all the dog shit in the city , you could be elected Mayor .
CLEVE JONES: `` Mayor Milk . ''
HARVEY MILK: I like it .
CLERK: Supervisor Lau ?
GORDON LAU: Aye .
CLERK: Lau , Aye . Supervisor Silver ?
DAN WHITE: No .
CLERK: White , No . Madam President , I have ten ayes and one no . Dianne Feinstein BANGS HER GAVEL down hard .
DIANNE FEINSTEIN: The San Francisco Gay Rights Ordinance sponsored by Supervisors Milk and Silver is passed .
MAYOR MOSCONE: I ca n't get my stories on page ten , you 're getting page one ?
HARVEY MILK: Doggy-doo 's a real problem , George .
MAYOR MOSCONE: Good morning , everyone I do n't do this enough , taking swift and unambiguous action on a substantive move for civil rights .
HARVEY MILK: What are you working on , Dan ?
DAN WHITE: If you have something to discuss , you can have your aide make an appointment with my aide .
HARVEY MILK: Listen , I know you 're disappointed about the Psychiatric Center What else do you have coming up ?
DAN WHITE: Now you need something from me . You want my me to join in with the Queers on this Prop Six business ?
HARVEY MILK: We prefer the word `` gay , '' Dan . Just as I 'm sure you prefer the word , `` Irish-American '' to `` Mick . ''
DAN WHITE: Harvey , our society ca n't exist without the family , without the church .
HARVEY MILK: We 're not against those things .
DAN WHITE: You 're not ? Can two men reproduce ?
HARVEY MILK: No . But , we keep trying !
DAN WHITE: Okay . You introduce an initiative for Supervisor pay raises .
HARVEY MILK: It 's a bad time politically . I have an election next year .
DAN WHITE: You asked for something . Introduce pay raises . I ca n't take care of my family on our salaries . You do n't have that problem , do you ?
HARVEY MILK: What 's wrong , Taco Bell ?
JACK LIRA: Anne and Cleve tried to cut me out of your table . You should fire them .
HARVEY MILK: I 'll take it under consideration . Why do n't you get us a drink ?
SCOTT SMITH: Do n't let Cezar Chavez hear you calling him Taco Bell .
HARVEY MILK: He 's getting better . He 's enrolling in classes on Monday . Scott wipes PIE CREAM from Harvey 's jacket .
SCOTT SMITH: I remember when your birthdays were a bit less lavish . More intimate .
HARVEY MILK: Who invited you ? Anne ?
SCOTT SMITH: My boyfriend got an invitation . I was his `` plus one . ''
HARVEY MILK: Congratulations . It was a tough ticket to get .
SCOTT SMITH: Congratulations to you . Looks like you 're part of the Machine now . You can do better .
HARVEY MILK: When I come home to Jack , I do n't have to talk politics or talk intelligently . Or even talk .
SCOTT SMITH: You 're not so old . You look handsome Happy 48th . Looks like you 're gon na make it to fifty after- all , Mr . Milk . Scott gives Harvey a BIRTHDAY KISS .
DAN WHITE: Sorry I missed the party , Harv
HARVEY MILK: No problem , Dan . Good to see you .
DAN WHITE: Dog poop ?
HARVEY MILK: Yeah .
DAN WHITE: It 's good ! It 's a good one .
HARVEY MILK: Thanks . But it 's a real problem .
DAN WHITE: Oh , yeah . I mean , God knows how many problems it causes . All kinds of diseases , birth defects probably , I mean , stuff you ca n't even Hey , I got you a little something .
HARVEY MILK: You did n't have to
DAN WHITE: You did n't have to
LAUGHING: Why do people always say that ? `` You did n't have to ? '' I mean , of course , right ? But , that 's what they always say . They always say things like that
HARVEY MILK: Are you okay , Dan ?
DAN WHITE: Oh , what ? Yeah , sure . Harvey , I just I just want to say Happy Birthday .
HARVEY MILK: I doubt that .
DAN WHITE: No , I have . You got ta get out there . Get noticed . That 's how it works . But , you have an issue . That 's your advantage .
HARVEY MILK: It 's more than an issue , Dan . Dan . I 've had four relationships in my life . Three of those four tried to kill themselves . I know it was my fault they did it . I told them to stay quiet . To hide . Most of my life I 've been closeted . That 's what living this life is like fo most of us . The way things are This is n't just about our jobs , o any issue , it 's our lives we 're fighting for .
DAN WHITE: I 've learned a lot from you , Harvey . I 'm going to get my picture in the papers , too . You 'll see . I 've got my own issue . That 's ight . Dan White 's Got An Issue !
HARVEY MILK: Come out ! Just come on out !
DAN WHITE: I see naked men walking around , naked women walking around , which does n't bother me as far as my personal standards of nudity , but it 's not proper . We would n't allow it for any other parade in San Francisco , and it should not be allowed for the gay parade .
ANNE KRONENBERG: It came in the mail today .
HARVEY MILK: `` You get the first bullet the minute you stand at the microphone . '' Looks like the publicity 's working .
ANNE KRONENBERG: You do n't have to go up there .
HARVEY MILK: It could happen any day , any night , any time The nation 's eye is on us . I have to do this .
CLEVE JONES: The Mayor says Briggs is on his way here . He could intercept him fo us . We could get him face to face . He could n't ignore us anymore .
HARVEY MILK: Get the press .
JOHN BRIGGS: The parade is the other direction .
DRIVER: They 're taking us another way , Sir .
JOHN BRIGGS: I have a right to be here , Mr. Mayor .
MAYOR MOSCONE: I 'm afraid it 's not in the interest of your safety , or my public 's safety to let you into that parade grounds .
HARVEY MILK: Hi , I 'm Harvey Milk . It 's quite an honor to meet you , Mr. Briggs .
JOHN BRIGGS: I 'm aware . Sad you 're too afraid to fight this out in public , Mr . Milk .
HARVEY MILK: No sir . I would love to have a public debate . I 'm very interested in the details of your argument .
JOHN BRIGGS: You know the details . As do the people . Look at the votes across this nation . The `` public '' is with me .
HARVEY MILK: Yes sir , today they are . But with my City 's Mayor and the San Francisco press as my witnesses , I 'm challenging you to a public debate .
JOHN BRIGGS: Not in my mind they have n't
HARVEY MILK: That 's it . In your mind they have n't , and I 'm wondering why
JOHN BRIGGS: Mr . Milk , we do n't allow people who elieve in practicing bestiality to teach our children , and the reason we do n't is because it is illegal . But it 's not illegal to be a homosexual in California .
HARVEY MILK: And your law goes even further . Any school employee who even supports a gay person will be fired
JOHN BRIGGS: True . But , gay people do n't have children of their own . If they do n't recruit our children , they 'd all die away . That 's why they want to be teachers , to encourage ou children to join them .
JOHN BRIGGS: If they 're going to lead such an open life of homosexuality that they want a 21-gun salute every time somebody goes by them , those people are going to be in danger of eing removed their job .
HARVEY MILK: We were really genuinely frightened y Proposition Six , and with the acklash gaining strength , we were very pessimistic . We did n't think there was any chance we could beat it . What we hoped to do was to organize to the point that when we did lose , there would be a evolt That all hell would break lose .
DICK PABICH: People are coming out , though . We met with groups in Bakersfield , Redding , a dozen people showed up in a library basement in Fresno asking for our support if they came out . Last Sunday , the Reverend of St. Mary 's came out to his entire congregation
HARVEY MILK: We 're still losing , 60 to 30 . We have to take the show on the road . Call Briggs 's office . Do a press elease . Tell them he can pick the town , the audience , and I 'll ask our supporters not to attend .
DICK PABICH: Their audiences are insanely devout . We 'll get killed .
HARVEY MILK: Get me Orange County .
JACK LIRA: You just have to go down to LA and guess the right things on TV and they 'll pay us You have to use your fame now while you have it . We could have nice things .
HARVEY MILK: I do n't have time to do game shows ight now This stops Jack cold .
JACK LIRA: You are horrible ! I have worked on this surprise for you for weeks !
HARVEY MILK: Are you drunk right now ?
JACK LIRA: You are an ungrateful asshole !
HARVEY MILK: Jack , I 'll have more time soon .
JACK LIRA: You 're ashamed of me !
HARVEY MILK: That 's not true . I think you 're smart . You 're capable . No matte what your family or your fathe said . I believe in you We should figure out something for you to do . I could get you a job .
JACK LIRA: I 'll never be good enough for you !
HARVEY MILK: I 'll get a broom . Harvey goes . Jack collapses into a chair .
JOHN BRIGGS: Same thing with VD Harvey , we put out publications about VD so you can avoid it .
HARVEY MILK: But you 've even admitted that there 's more molestation in the heterosexual group ! So why not get id of the heterosexual teachers ? Boos from the conservative audience .
JOHN BRIGGS: We are not talking about homos child molestation , the fact is , at least 95 percent of the people are heterosexual . If we took heterosexuals out AND homosexuals out , you know what
HARVEY MILK: No child molestation So you 're saying the percentage of population is equal to the percentage of child molestation ?
JOHN BRIGGS: No , no , I 'm not saying that at all
HARVEY MILK: That 's what you just said .
JOHN BRIGGS: No . I 'm saying that we can not prevent child molestation so let 's cut our odds down and take out the homosexual group and keep in the heterosexual group
HARVEY MILK: Sir , in your own drive fo personal power , how many careers are you willing to see destroyed ? How many lives will you destroy in your lust for power , and when will you stop ?
DAN WHITE: All I 'm really saying is , if we do n't protect ourselves with this kind of legislation , a transvestite can show up at a public school with all the qualifications for teaching and they ca n't refuse to hire him .
HARVEY MILK: Hey Jack , what 's wrong ?
JACK LIRA: Nothing . I just want to know when you 'll be home .
HARVEY MILK: You just had them pull me out of my ig vote on the dog shit ordinance . Did you do this on purpose , Jack ?
JACK LIRA: It 's poop , Harvey . Are n't I more important than poop ?
HARVEY MILK: Yes , but I do n't know when I 'll e home . Maybe 6 . 6 15 .
JACK LIRA: Fine . 6 15 .
HARVEY MILK: Dan ? How 's the baby ?
DAN WHITE: You did n't bring up Supervisor pay aises . In fact , I heard you plan to publicly oppose them .
HARVEY MILK: I heard you planned to vote against them too , Dan . Were you trying to set me up ?
DAN WHITE: ( parrotting Harvey
HARVEY MILK: Dan , there 's a vote to approve the police desegregation settlement , give me that and I 'll conside acking pay raises .
DAN WHITE: I do n't trade votes unlike you , the way I was raised , we believe in ight and wrong . Moral and immoral .
HARVEY MILK: Black skin and White in your police department ? Dan , even Ronald Reagan 's come out against Proposition Six . You 're looking more and more out of touch .
DAN WHITE: If I come out against Prop Six , it 's only for the invasion of State 's rights issue .
HARVEY MILK: And the potential witch hunts against you `` straight people , '' ight ?
DAN WHITE: You underestimate me , Milk . You 're very , very wrong about me .
HARVEY MILK: I do n't know what you mean .
DAN WHITE: You do n't You ca n't humiliate me . And you will not demean me .
PASSERBY: You 're the asshole that just passed that dog shit thing are n't you ? What the hell do you have against dogs ?
HARVEY MILK: Sir , blind people ca n't see `` shit . '' What the heck do you have against lind people ?
SCOTT SMITH: Harvey . Look at me . Look at me . You did everything you could .
HARVEY: No , I did n't . Not everything
SCOTT SMITH: What else could you have done ?
HARVEY: I could have come home at six o'clock , not six-fifteen .
CLEVE JONES: `` Beware . The ides . Of November . ''
HARVEY MILK: Jack was gone . I did n't have time to mourn There was no choice but to keep on to keep fighting .
GIRL: No . What the heck are you ?
HARVEY MILK: Oh , me ? I 'm an elected official . I un this city .
DICK PABICH: San Bernadino is coming in . Not good .
HARVEY MILK: Of course not . How not good ?
MICHAEL WONG: 60 % for Briggs . Same in Fresno .
HARVEY MILK: Dear God , little Lotus Blossom .
JIM RIVALDO: Imperial is 69 % `` for '' so far .
HARVEY MILK: Put it up on the board .
CLEVE JONES: I can have 15,000 people in an hour . But there 's gon na be riots if this thing passes .
HARVEY MILK: There goddamn better be .
CLEVE JONES: What are you telling me ?
HARVEY MILK: I ca n't say it because I 'm a public official , but for God 's sake , if this thing passes , fight back .
ANNE KRONENBERG: Don Amador down in LA .
HARVEY: Kind of a bad time , Don .
HARVEY MILK: Paul who ?
YOUNG TEEN: I 'm sorry . I should have called . When I read in the paper that you won the Supervisor seat , I got a friend to put me on a bus to LA .
HARVEY MILK: Who did you know in Los Angeles ?
YOUNG TEEN: Nobody . That 's the uh I just did n't want to die anymore , sir . I met your friend Don down here . I turned 18 . I voted today against Prop Six Thank you , Mr . Milk .
HARVEY MILK: No . You did this all by yourself .
YOUNG TEEN: I do n't think I 'd be alive right now without you , sir . You were right about LA . It 's like gay Disney World .
HARVEY MILK: Then you have to see San Francisco !
YOUNG TEEN: Okay . I will . Don wanted me to um congratulate you on what he says looks like a big win for us tonight . Congratulations Mr . Milk .
HARVEY MILK: I got ta go , Don . Thank you . LA by 65 % put it up ! Put it up !
JIM RIVALDO: The polls were off . Briggs is going down by more than 2 to 1 . The only district where it 's leading in San Francisco is Dan White 's .
HARVEY MILK: Well crap Cleve , now what are we going to do tonight ? ! Cover up Lady Liberty . The cameras will be coming our way .
CHEERS: Tonight Tonight it is clear that everyone out there does know one of us . And now that they do , they see we are not sick they can feel we are not wrong and they know we should have a place in this great country and in this world A message of hope has been to sent to all the young people out there to all those afraid of this wave of hate to all those who have lost their homes and their hometowns tonight we know there is a place for us ! My brothers and sisters we can come home again !
CLEVE JONES: What 's the matter ?
HARVEY MILK: You ever heard of sore losers ? Well , I 'm a sore winner I thought we were goners .
CLEVE JONES: I told you , I do n't `` do '' losing .
HARVEY MILK: I think maybe we 're best with ou acks to the wall . It 's too quiet . I think we should march on Washington D.C. next year .
CLEVE JONES: Milk , you 're a decent politician , a mediocre businessman , but you 're a lousy gay man . Take some time off . Fifty 's right around the corner . Nobody will want you after that I can handle D.C .
HARVEY MILK: The people voted for us , Cleve Jones .
CLEVE JONES: They did . There 's nowhere to march tonight , Mr. Harvey Milk . Lets go ack inside .
DAN WHITE: Could you give this to the Mayo for me ? As soon as possible .
HARVEY MILK: Morning , Dan .

HARVEY MILK: I 'm sure we could work together
OFFICER: Hey , Dan . Just got word . Can we talk to you for a minute ?
DAN WHITE: Sure Dan heads for his office .
OFFICER: Downstairs . The Association meeting room
DAN WHITE: It was a major decision on Friday that I had to come to arrive at . But since that time , people unknown to me , plus my family and friends , have come to me and stated that they want me to stay in office , that they support me So I 'm asking the Mayor to let me stay in office to serve the people
HARVEY MILK: He gets dragged into a closed doo meeting with the Police Officers Association , and comes out demanding his job back ? What do you think they promised him ? Or worse , how did they threaten him ?
MAYOR MOSCONE: A man has the right to change his mind . Give me some peace .
HARVEY MILK: How many of our propositions has Dan shut down ? We could finally settle this police desegregation nonsense . Cement rent control . It 's his vote on this Board that stands in our way .
MAYOR MOSCONE: I get it , Harvey . I 've been lobbied all week . Enough .
HARVEY MILK: Let me just remind you that you 're up for re-election . If you re- appoint Dan , you lose the gay vote . They listen to me . You wo n't get elected dog catcher .
MAYOR MOSCONE: I 'll make my decision on Monday . You know what you sounded like just now ? Boss Tweed or Mayor Daly .
HARVEY MILK: A `` homosexual '' with a bit of power rather scary is n't it , Mr. Mayor ? OFF Harvey . He 's come a long way .
DAN WHITE: Yes . This is Dan White .
SCOTT SMITH: Hello ? REVEAL Scott , half asleep .

MAN: And you are ?
DAN WHITE: I 'm Dan White . City Supervisor .
HARVEY MILK: Who 's it gon na be ? Is he replacing Dan with that God Damned liberal lefty Don Horanzy ? That 'll really shake up the Board , huh ?
DIANNE FEINSTEIN: All I know is that we 're getting a new Supervisor today . If Dan shows up , just avoid him . We do n't need a scene today , right Harvey ?
HARVEY MILK: Heaven forbid , Dianne .
DAN WHITE: You ca n't take this away from me !
MAYOR MOSCONE: The issue is what 's fair , for the people of your district . Take some time off . Spend it with you family .
DAN WHITE: Say , Harve , can I see you for a minute ?
HARVEY MILK: Sure .
HARVEY: from Altoona , Pennsylvania , and the voice was quite young , and the person said `` Thanks . '' You 've got to elect gay people so that that young child and the thousands upon thousand like him know there 's hope hope for a better world
SCOTT SMITH: Where is everybody ? Did n't anyone give a damn ?
HARVEY MILK: I ask this If there should be an assassination , I would hope that five , ten , one hundred , a thousand would rise . I would like to see every gay lawyer , every gay architect come out
SUSAN: We 'll see
ANCHORMAN: Only after the numbers had reached into the thousands were officials able to identify the carrier of the deadly infection
DIRECTOR: Cut to three .
ANCHORMAN: Blattida Germanica . The common cockroach .
DIRECTOR: Tell them we 're ready for a live feed .
REPORTER 1: an insect that has proven virtually immune to chemical control
REPORTER 2: the announcement by the Health Department that an end to the nightmare has finally
REPORTER 3: an ex-colleague of Doctor Susan Wyeth
PROTESTER: Susan has always been opposed to iological tampering . A real advocate for ecological causes , it 's not
PETER: in Nature , evolution is a long , leisurely conversation between an organism and its environment . We , however , did not have the luxury of time
SUSAN: With the aid of genetic labs throughout the country , we recombined cockroach DNA with genetic information from termites and mantids . We were able to create a iological counter-agent . A new ally , if you will
SUSAN: The Judas is a non-carrier of Stricklers , with a short life-span and heightened pheromone emission .
PETER: We 've achieved almost total eradication of the roach population . As of today , the disease has been officially contained .
SUSAN: Please .
PETER: You did ! He sits by the tub .
SUSAN: Do you think we did the right thing ?
PETER: Taking a cab instead of hiring a limo ?
SUSAN: You know what I mean Peter pours some champagne into the cups .
PETER: Is this a Catholic guilt thing ? We hear a NEWSREADER on the TV .
SUSAN: We just do n't know .
PETER: We know we saved lives . He sits closer to her .
SUSAN: We 're down to a `` couple '' now , huh ? She pats the water , beckoning .
PETER: Oh , I do n't know . People are beginning to talk about us
SUSAN: Do n't worry , I 'll save your honor . Maybe I 'll even marry you . She reaches over , kisses him .
CHINESE PREACHER: No . Please , God , no !
PETER: Excuse me , ladies
SUSAN: no , guys , these have to fit perfectly . No spaces in between . Let me tell you why . Insects have no hands . All they have is this set of mandibles . She grabs the outer mandible set .
PETER: `` Baby in a bottle '' He gives it to Susan .
SUSAN: Do n't tease .
PETER: You know where they get this fertility stuff ? They extract it from the urine of menopausal Italian nuns .
SUSAN: Monks bottle their own wine . Do n't they ? She gently touches her belly .
PETER: Do n't get kinky here
SUSAN: I 'll be late .
SIRI: Just like Trump Tower , then .
JOSH: So I say `` buddy , you have every violation in the book . Gim me one good reason not to close you down . '' You know what the Kraut says to me ?
PETER: Selling your sould for a fistful of carbohydrates
JOSH: Not just any carbohydrates , mind you . It was like being on the receiving end of some kind of transcendent oral sex . We should get a strobe on this thing . Maybe even a siren .
PETER: Yeah , and a loudspeaker so you can yell `` Epidemic ! Epidemic ! You 're all going to die ! ''
JOSH: Health Department The cops let them pass .
PETER: You really love flashing that thing , do n't you ?

WOYCHEK: No . We waited .
PETER: Good .
MANNY: C'mon Chuy , we 're gon na be late . Cops are bad news . Do n't look at them .

IANE: What ? No , I did n't !
ANTON: Yes , I spoke to you myself , you say sometheeng come up .
DIANE: Jeanette , you knew I had an appointment today , did you pretend-
JEANETTE: No , I , I Anton called me and told me he had a cancellation .
ANTON: Yes , I call her after you call me .
DIANE: Why , you sneaky little bitch !
MINI: Do you think she 'll press charges ?
DIANE: Are you kidding ? She should get twenty to life ! When I told Margo and Penny about her little stunt , they both said they 'd have ripped her eyes out . She 'll be lucky if anyone speaks to her again .
MARTIN: Here comes the choo-choo .
DIANE: For god 's sake , I did n't break both hands .
MINI: Jeez , I still ca n't believe you oke your hand on her face ? It 's so Linda Hamilton .
DIANE: I hope she enjoys shitting out the teeth she swallowed .
CARLOS: R osa Angelica , this is Carlos .
MINI: Gosh , look at all the pretty flowers .
CARLOS: Your mother said you are having a ig party !
MINI: I know , can you believe all this ?
DIANE: Carlos , what the hell is going on ?
CARLOS: Senora Tannen , the delivery you ordered yesterday for the party ?
DIANE: Ordered , I did n't order anything ? ! Who told you to bring these here ?
CARLOS: But , but , Senora , you did , you called me , I talked to you .
DIANE: No , you did n't !
CARLOS: Sí , you said you were having a party , do n't you remember ?
INI: Mom , is that what you were talking about yesterday ?
DIANE: What ? !
MINI: Well , it was after lunch and you had washed your pain killers down with some wine . You mumbled something about a party before you took a nap .
DIANE: No , I did not !
MINI: Mom , you did . The doctor said no more mixing pain killers and alcohol .
DIANE: But , butI only slept for
MINI: I am so sorry . Listen , we 'll pay , do n't worry .
DIANE: Oh , god .
MARTIN: What is going on ? ! Carlos , what the fuck are all these flowers doing here ? !
CARLOS: Señor Tannen , we
DIANE: Uh , Martin , I , I
MARTIN: Diane , did you order all this ? !
MINI: Mom , go inside , just go , I 'll handle him . It 's under control , Dad . Please , let 's not make a scene .
BISHOP: As we see from a closer examination of the facts , Abraham Lincoln 's decision to
MINI: Mr. Bishop , can I go to the little girls room ?
BISHOP: Of course , Mini .
DIANE: Mini ! I asked you for that drink ten minutes ago !
MINI: You 're welcome .
DIANE: Mmmthis is really good . What 's in it , Sweetie ?
MINI: Oh , this and that .
DIANE: My god , let me tell you , breaking my hand on that bitch 's face
HUSBAND #1: So I looked each and every juror in the eye-
DIANE: I want to talk to you about juries , will you come and talk to me about juries ?
HUSBAND #1: Uh
DIANE: I 'd like to be on a jury and say `` guilty ! '' or `` sidebar ! '' What do you think goes on in all the sequestered situations ? Do you think any of the jurors have sex with each other ? I was once on an episode of Love Boat , playing the ole of `` Bikini Girl '' and my line was `` I 'll have another , '' it was with `` Isaac '' at the pool bar . I had to suck one of the associate producers off to get the line , but it got me my SAG card , so I guess it was worth it .
HUSBAND #2: Uh , I think I could use a refill .
HUSBAND #1: Me too , please , excuse us .
DIANE: But , but we were talking about juries and Isaac and , and that drag queen I broke my face on and..
DIANE: And then I told him that I had een an extra on Hello Larry and Mike Farrell had tried to
MINI: MacLean Stevenson .
DIANE: What ?
MINI: MacLean Stevenson played `` Larry . ''
DIANE: Right , that 's what I saidand then MacKenzie Phillips tried to slip me the tongue !
MARTIN: Listen , great job , but you need to give me more warning . I was at dinner with Chapman , and it 's the second time I 've had to re- schedule .
MINI: I 'm sorry , but it was a golden opportunity . You always said you ca n't pay enough for good publicity .
MINI: Hey , boys .
DIANE: Hello ?
IANE: This is n't funny . I 'm hanging up .
DIANE: If this is some kind of joke
DIANE: I 'm hanging up .
SKATEPUNK #2: Take it easy , lady , what the hell 's your problem ?
DIANE: How do you know where I live ?
DIANE: No ! I ca n't leave , he knows where I live !
DIANE: Him !
DIANE: You 're leaving ? Both of you ?
MINI: Mom , we ca n't stay in here forever . Do you want to come with us ?
DIANE: Ica n't . You two go .
MINI: Okay .
DIANE: Hello ?
IANE: Please , please , oh god .
DIANE: Oh god , oh god !
DIANE: Nonohelp ! Help !
IANE: Help ! Someone please , help me !
DIANE: Please God , please Godplease !
MINI: Mom , we 're home !
MARTIN: Diane , honey , we brought you a pulled pork plate !
MINI: Mom ?
MARTIN: Diane , it 's us , wake up .
MINI: Wake up , Mommy .
MARTIN: Mini .
MINI: Killjoy .
MARTIN: Diane , come on , come on .
MINI: Martin
MINI: I picked that prescription up three days ago . It was probably more than half full .
MARTIN: Her pulse is almost gone .
MINI: Do you really think they can save her ?
MARTIN: II do n't know .
MINI: She 'll only try it again . You know she will .
MARTIN: She will if we keep this torture up .
MINI: Hold on , who are we to say he choice was wrong ? She put those pills in her mouth .
MARTIN: Mini
MINI: Do n't `` Mini '' me , you 've been ankrolling my little project from day one .
MARTIN: We both agreed murder was out .
MINI: I 'd hardly call it murder , if anything , we 're just helping to fulfill her last wish .
MARTIN: She would n't have taken the pills if we hadn't- Mini , for gods sake , she still has a pulse .
MINI: So do people in comas . It 's just a matter of time-
MARTIN: Mini , we-
MINI: Look , you can drop the indignant outrage , because if you really cared , you 'd have already grabbed the phone and dialed 911 by now .
MARTIN: What ? Just leave her here ?
MINI: Exactly .
MARTIN: I do n't know .
MINI: Can you think of one person she knows who would say she 's sane at this point ? This is just the natural , sad and inevitable conclusion to a tragic life .
MINI: We 're this close from being freelet 's just let nature take its course .
HOST: Welcome to `` Absolutely Positive ! '' The show where we give couples about to get married a last chance to make sure they 're
STUDIO AUDIENCE: Absolutely Positive !
HOST: That 's right ! We send them out on one last date with someone othe than their fiance , so they can be sure they 're really ready to make that lifelong commitment .
MINI: Come on , let 's go .
MARTIN: What ?
MINI: It 's time to speed this up .
MARTIN: Speed this up ?
MINI: We ca n't wait anymore , our alibi is only believable for maybe anothe hour . We can say that after dinne we went to a movie , but if she has n't croaked by midnight , you can forget about this .
MARTIN: No , I 'm sorry , this is going somewhere I 'm not prepared to go .
MINI: Oh , but you were prepared to sit here until the pills did her in ? I hate to break it to you , but wherever you `` were n't prepared to go '' the hypocrite express just olled into the station .
MARTIN: What are you suggesting ?
MINI: Well , I thought we 'd disembowel he and leave her for the raccoons .
ARTIN: Come on , we do n't have time .
MINI: Look , if we 're going to screw up the details we might as well call San Quentin and tell them to fire up the dutch oven . The gas chamber ? Martin , please , I ca n't explain everything .
MARTIN: I do n't think this is a good idea .
MINI: Have you lost your mind , `` Mr. Public Relations '' ? What 's the one thing all her friends are going to e talking about when they find out ? `` How did she look '' ? Do you think anyone will think twice if the answer is `` fabulous '' ?
MARTIN: Could you just pretend to have a little remorse ?
MINI: Help us , please ! My mom , I think she 's dead !
MARTIN: It 's okay , sweetheart , everything 's going to be okay .
FIRST PARAMEDIC: Mr. Tannen , I think you should take your daughter in the house .
MINI: Oh , please , do n't let her die !
GARSON: Mr. Tannen ?
MARTIN: Yes ?
MAN: I 'm Detective Bill Garson , LAPD .
MARTIN: Yes ?
GARSON: I 'm sorry to be here right now , but whenever there 's an apparent suicide we are required to do an investigation to rule out homicide .
MARTIN: Ohuhright .
GARSON: It 's really just a formality .
MINI: My mother just killed herself ! They have n't even taken her away yet ! What 's wrong with you ?
MINI: Tell him to leave ! This is outrageous !
MARTIN: Could we do this another time ?
GARSON: Of course we
MARTIN: Thank you .
GARSON: But I do need to ask just a few simple questions before I go .
MINI: Did n't you hear him ? ! He said
MARTIN: Mini , it 's okayjust go lie down for a moment .
GARSON: What about trying to revive you wife ?
MARTIN: Of course , we did that too , but I could n't feel a pulse . Mini took a course at school in CPR and tried that , but it did n't work .
GARSON: So your wife did this sometime etween 8 00 and 11 33 when you placed the 911 call ?
MARTIN: Yes .
GARSON: May I ask why you left your wife alone when she had been acting in such an unstable state ?
MARTIN: We never thought she 'd do anything likethis . After the episode in the mall , Diane had n't left the house for three days and my daughter and I just needed a break . It 's been a very stressful time .
GARSON: Of course . So this was your wife 's car ?
MARTIN: Yes .
GARSON: Was it in the garage when you left for dinner or did she drive it in ?
MARTIN: What ?
GARSON: Was it in the garage when you left ?
MARTIN: Is , is that important ?
MARTIN: Oh , wellafter she was brought home from the mall , the car was towed here and we put it in the garage .
GARSON: And no one drove it during those three days ?
MARTIN: No , Mini and I have our own cars .
GARSON: We are going to have to impound it for a few days to take it to the crime lab .
MARTIN: Crime lab ? Oh , okay .
GARSON: Again , purely routine .
MARTIN: Sure .
GARSON: Have you found a note yet ?
MARTIN: I 'm sorry ?
GARSON: A suicide note ? The deceased usually leaves one .
MARTIN: Ohright , nonot yet . But we have n't really looked .
GARSON: Mind if I take a look around ?
MARTIN: Noof course not .
MINI: Who cares if we did n't leave a note ? Just relax .
MARTIN: But they said it 's
MINI: So what ? He 'll do his little dance and chalk it up to another failed actress who realized after forty she might as well be dead .
MARTIN: Oh , shit !
MINI: What ?
MARTIN: The sweatsuits and goggles .
MINI: I already snuck out the back and threw them in Mike Rudell 's garbage cans .
MARTIN: Good .
MINI: Angelpie , just relax , we did it , we 're free .
MINI: You know , I 've been thinking that I might enjoy working in your office this summer .
MARTIN: Really ? Sure , if you want .
MINI: I want .
MARTIN: Ohhi , Mike , what , what are you doing here ?
RUDELL: Last week Mini mentioned you two were coming here for a little R & R , and I suddenly realized I had n't taken a vacation in god knows when . Jennifer , this is my neighbo Martin Tannen and his daughter , Mini .
MINI: I 'm sorry , but , Jennifer , have we met ? You look so familiar .
JENNIFER: I do n't think so .
MIKE: I wanted you both to know how sorry I am for your loss .
MARTIN: Thanks , Mike , we appreciate it .
MINI: I was just being friendly , I had no idea he 'd decide to come here .
MARTIN: He knows . He found the clothes and goggles and he fucking knows !
MINI: I doubt he even knows where his trash cans are .
MARTIN: Yeah , well coincidence or not , he saw us together .
MINI: It was dark , I sat up before he saw anything . M
ARTIN: No , he knows . It was like he was toying with us .
MINI: Just relax , what is he going to do ? Go home and tell everyone we 're a couple ? We 'll just laugh it off and tell everyone he vacations with hookers .
MARTIN: You realize he could blackmail us ? If the police found out about us , that suicide would n't look so outine .
MINI: Martin , please , calm down . Trust me , nothing is going to happen .
MINI: `` Happy birthday , Mr. President ''
GARSON: Minerva Tannen , Detective Garson , I do n't know if you remember me ?
MINI: Drogues , my last name is Drogues . And `` yes '' , I remember you , you were the big hearted lug who wanted you questions answered while my mothe was still warm .
GARSON: So , Mr. Tannen is your stepfather ?
MINI: Nice work , McGruff .
GARSON: Again , I am sorry about that night , ut it is policy that we get the preliminary facts as soon as possible .
MINI: What do you want ?
GARSON: I need to ask you a few more questions about your mother 's death . M
INI: Sure , come on in .
GARSON: It 's a little early for the prom , is n't it ?
MINI: A girl can dream , ca n't she ?
GARSON: Perfectly legal . So , anyway , we got the preliminary coroner 's report . Although the pills knocked her out , she died of the carbon monoxide poisoning from the exhaust .
MINI: Is it that important ?
GARSON: Well , it 's just a little unusual for a suicide victim to use two methods . Her choices seemed , I do n't know how to put it improvisational .
MINI: Well , maybe she wanted to drift off efore the fumes got her ? She clearly put some thought into that outfit .
GARSON: ClearlyBut dying from carbon monoxide poisoning is actually pretty painless , you just basically pass out .
MINI: I doubt she would have had an intimate knowledge of how car fumes feel when you choke on them .
GARSON: I suppose you 're rightAlso we checked the phone records and there was a 911 call placed at 8 12 . It was a hang up and when the 911 dispatcher called back a few minutes later , there was no answer .
MINI: Really ?
GARSON: Any idea why she 'd call 911 ?
MINI: Look , I think you should come back when my father 's around . He 'll be upset I let a stranger in the house . G
ARSON: I think you 're safe with me .
MINI: Even so , he wo n't be happy .
GARSON: Not a problem , will he be home tonight ?
MARTIN: And you let him in ? !
MINI: I played it cool , it would 've looked worse to be defensive .
MINI: Okay .
GARSON: I really appreciate you taking the time to help us out . There 's just a few loose ends we want to tie up .
MARTIN: Absolutely . What would you like to know ?
ARSON: There appears to be some question as to the time of death . You said you went to dinner and a movie-
MARTIN: Detective , not to be overly sensitive , but do I need my lawye here ? Because these sound like the questions one asks when there 's a homicide investigation .
GARSON: Mr. Tannen , I 'd really like to just finish this up , I 've got real homicides that need attention . How about if I just ask you some questions and the one 's you do n't want to answer , we 'll just skip ?
MINI: That sounds good , does n't it , Dad ? I mean , let 's just get this ove with .
MARTIN: Fair enough .
GARSON: Terrificnow , the preliminary lood report indicated she had italin in her system .
MARTIN: I was n't aware my wife was taking italin .
GARSON: Neither was her physician , he had never prescribed it .
MARTIN: Well , as you may have discovered by now , my wife had substance abuse problems , I 'm sure there were many drugs she took without a prescription .
GARSON: I know , but it 's an odd drug to be taking . It 's mostly given to adults and children with Attention Deficit Disorder to calm them . But in people who do n't need it , it has the reverse effect , making them incredibly hyper and agitated .
MARTIN: Again , Detective , I really ca n't say why she was taking these drugs .
GARSON: Fair enoughMr . Tannen , were you and your wife close ?
MARTIN: Nowe led , for the most part , separate lives . We had decided to stay together for Mini .
GARSON: I see
MARTIN: Listen , Detective Garson , I must admit I do n't see the relevance of these questions . Diane was an extremely disturbed person . Have n't you interviewed enough people who saw her at her worst ?
GARSON: Yes , but what I 'm still unclea about is her time of death .
MARTIN: Well , that makes two of us Again , detective , we were out fo the whole evening .
GARSON: After dinner you saw a movie that night ?
MARTIN: That 's right .
GARSON: What did you see ?
MARTIN: That new Jackie Chan movie where the terrorists try to blow up Mount Rushmore .
GARSON: AhhMy buddy told me the end is crazy .
MARTIN: Yeah , he slides down Washington 's nose with the bomb strapped to him .
MINI: DadDo n't give it away , he has n't seen it yet .
MARTIN: Another demerit
GARSON: That 's okayWhere did you see it ?
MARTIN: The Galleria .
GARSON: And you got home at ?
MARTIN: 11 30 .
GARSON: No , that about wraps it up for now .
MARTIN: For now ? Detective we are trying very hard to put our lives back together , but every time you come y , it just dredges everything back up . We 've told you everything we know . G
ARSON: I wish I could be more definitive .
MARTIN: Well , I 'm telling you the next time you have a question , it had bette e because you 're charging us-
GARSON: Us ?
MARTIN: I 'm just asking you to please let us deal with our grief and get on with our lives .
GARSON: Thanks again for your time .
MARTIN: What the hell was I thinking , letting you talk me into this ?
MINI: It 's probably just routine stuff .
MARTIN: That was not routine , my dear .
MINI: Nice use of the word `` us '' , by the way .
MARTIN: Sorry , it just slipped out .
MINI: If I had a nickel for every time I heard that-
MARTIN: Okay .
MINI: Look , just chill , I 'm sure this will blow over in a few days .
MARTIN: Chill ? ! Believe me , we 'll be chilling in a pine box if he figures everything out . You do understand they could go for the death penalty ?
MINI: He 's probably just trying to spook us .
MARTIN: Hello ? ! They do n't try and spook you unless they think you did it !
MINI: It was a great plan , no one can prove we stuck those sleeping pills in her mouth , because we did n't .
MARTIN: Well , if it was such a great plan , why am I cancelling business dinners to accommodate a detective who appears convinced it was n't a suicide ?
MINI: I 'll see you later .
MARTIN: Where are you going ?
MINI: Out .
MARTIN: A phone call would have been appreciated at some point . I was worried .
MINI: UhMartin , I 'm not sure you 're aware , but at this point you ca n't e my dad and my lover . Where I go and how late I stay out is my usiness .
MARTIN: I was n't saying that as a dad . Before your mother and Igrew apart , I would worry if she was out late .
MINI: Well , that 's sweet , but I 'm not he and I can assure you I wo n't end up passed out in some greaseball 's fuck pad with my panties around my ankles
MARTIN: What the hell 's gotten into you ? I just expressed concern for you and you turn around and threaten me ? Mini , in a relationship , it 's okay to worry about someone else .
MINI: Congratulations you 're my first .
MARTIN: Oh , angel .
LOIS: Mr. Tannen , this just arrived fo you .
MARTIN: Lois , I need you to re-schedule the Chapman meeting I knowTell himtell him it 's an unavoidable emergency .
CLERK: When it 's paid cash , we only keep ecords on packages , not envelopes .
MARTIN: Yeah ?
MARTIN: Thank you , Lois .
BOYD: We ca n't afford to lose any more clients .
MARTIN: Jesus , guys , my wife just committed suicide
MATHER: No one 's saying this is n't a difficult time for you , but whatever 's been distracting you started long before that .
BOYD: There 's just no way to sugarcoat thisyou 're a liability we ca n't afford anymore
MARTIN: Fifteen yearswe 've been
MATHER: We 'll be asking all our clients who they would prefer to stay with , and of course , you 'll have an equal shot to make your case with them .
MARTIN: Fucking shit ! Fucking shit ! Fucking shit !
MINI: What are you gon na do ?
MINI: Are you crazy ? We 're not even positive it 's him !
MARTIN: My god , the picture was dropped off at a messenger service right across the street from his office ! He was the only person at the resort who knew who we were !
MINI: He could go to the cops and tell them you threatened him , then they 'd really start investigating us . It 's just one photo and you ca n't even really tell if it 's me .
MARTIN: That son of bitch just cost me the firm I worked fifteen years to uild .
MINI: Well , if you start waving that thing around , he 's gon na cost you a lot more than that .
MINI: Hi , Mr. Rudell , I 'm sorry to bothe you .
RUDELL: Not at all , as I said down in Mexico anything for a neighbor .
MINI: May I come in ?
RUDELL: It was just finished . I 'm sorry your mother never got to see it completed .
MINI: I know she 'd approve .
RUDELL: If you do n't mind me asking , how are you doing ?
MINI: It 's been hard , but I guess I 've just been telling myself that she 's probably much happier where she is now .
RUDELL: You 're absolutely-
MINI: Positive ! ?
RUDELL: Well , that too , but `` correct '' was the word I was thinking of . Do you like the show ?
MINI: Oh , god , it 's my favorite . I love how you never know if the couples will decide to stay together .
RUDELL: I could arrange for you to go to the set one day if you 'd like , o even be a contestant ?
MINI: A contestant ? Really ?
RUDELL: Sure , those dates are really quite harmless . You just spend an evening with the person . We prep you on what to say before the show .
MINI: It sounds like fun .
RUDELL: Anyway , what 's on your mind ?
MINI: Well , umthis may sound strange , ut you have n't seen any suspicious looking people around our house lately ?
RUDELL: No , is everything okay ?
MINI: Yes , it 's just that since mom 's death , someone sent us a photo of Martin and I together .
RUDELL: Together ?
MINI: It indicated that we wereI know this sounds crazy , buta couple .
RUDELL: A couple ? You and Martin ? HmmmI mean , certainly older men and younger women are an accepted part of society , but for someone to do that , wellit 's just tasteless .
MINI: Exactly , so we 're just trying to figure who Rit could be .
UDELL: Hmm , I have n't noticed anyone at allOut of curiosity , what kind of a picture could they send you to indicate that you and Martin were together ?
MINI: Oh , it was n't like we were naked o anything . I mean , of course , he 's seen me naked , he is my step- father .
RUDELL: Of course .
MINI: `` Who can take tomorrow ? Dip it in a dream , separate the sorrow and collect up all the cream , the candy man , oh , the candy man can ''
MINI: `` The candy man can 'cause he mixes it with love and makes the world taste good ''
BISHOP: Mini , I 've got a message for you to go to the principal 's office right away .
MINI: Detective Garson , is everything all ight ?
GARSON: We 've lifted two prints from the door and the inside of the medicine cabinet . They do n't match the nurse .
PRINCIPAL ANDREWS: Mini , is there something you 'd like to say to Detective Garson ?
MINI: Can we see the tape of the De Führer sucking down her afternoon fix of Smirnoff , or do n't you have cameras in the bathroom stalls ?
PRINCIPAL ANDREWS: Young lady , stealing anything , especially prescription drugs is a serious matter .
MINI: You got me , okay ? But what was I supposed to do ?
PRINCIPAL ANDREWS: What do you mean ?
MINI: SheShe said if I did n't , she waswas gon na
PRINCIPAL ANDREWS: Who ? Another student ?
MINI: My mother ! She made me steal them for her ! I did n't want to , but she said she was going to send me to oarding school in Canada if I did n't ! P
RINCIPAL ANDREWS: Canada ?
MINI: The Yukon territories ! Are you happy , now ? You got me !
PRINCIPAL ANDREWS: Oh my lord , I had know idea , she was
MINI: An addict ? Detective Garson knew ! We told him , and now what ? The whole school 's gon na know ! ?
PRINCIPAL ANDREWS: Detective Garson , I assume , there wo n't be a need to press charges against Ms. Drogues ?
MINI: You gon na cuff me , Copper ! ?
GARSON: She 's free to go .
MARTIN: Detective , I told you no more questions without my lawyer .
GARSON: I think you 'd better call him .
MARTIN: I suppose I can try .
GARSON: The final toxicology report came ack and your wife definitely did n't die from the pills . She was n't conscious past 9 30 , but it was the fumes that killed her .
VOLANT: Martin , easy .
MARTIN: I 'm sorry , but this is harassment .
GARSON: See , here 's what I needed to ask you . The gas tank in the Jag was almost full , just a gallon had been used .
MARTIN: And ?
GARSON: Well , if she was unconscious by 9 30 , that means the car must have een running for at least two hours when you found her . An unconscious person ca n't turn on a car , right ?
VOLANT: Detective , with all due respect , could you get to the point ?
GARSON: Well , here 's where I get confused , see , that particular model idling for two hours will burn at least four gallons of gas .
GARSON: So , I guess what I 'm asking is , whose idea was it to put her in the car ?
VOLANT: Martin , do n't say anything .
GARSON: Now , Mr. Tannen , you clearly had the most to gain from her death , ut I 've learned from a number of your wife 's friends that she and Mini had a strained relationship .
VOLANT: Again , Detective , my client wo n't e answering anything , so let 's just cut the cat and mouse .
GARSON: I 'd like Mr. Tannen to know that if he 's trying to be a protective father by covering up something Mini did , I 'd be careful . The district attorney is viewing this case as an opportunity to show the public that the rich do n't get away with murder in this town .
OLANT: Does this mean he 's offering Mr. Tannen immunity if he says he was protecting his daughter ?
GARSON: It 's a strong possibility . But he wants Mr. Tannen to know he will go for the maximum sentence if he does n't . No manslaughter , no plea argains , nothing .
MINI: It was Colonel Mustard in the library with the candlestick .
PELHAM: UhMiss Drogues , as your lawyer-
MINI: Do n't wet your pants , I know when to shut up and swallow
GARSON: Look , the fact that the marriage was unhappy and there was no pre- nup gives all the motive to Martin .
MINI: So you want me to say it was his idea ?
GARSON: If it was his idea , give me one eason you should take the fall ?
MINI: So if I tell the jury it was his idea and I was scared for my life , ecause he said he 'd kill me if I ever told anyone , then I walk ?
MARTIN: I never doubted for a minute you were going to hold firm . Not a second . I hope you know that ?
MINI: Oh , I knewI knew .
MARTIN: Good . You realize , we 've got to ely on each other ?
MINI: Who else do we have ?
MARTIN: Exactly . We 're almost home free . My lawyer says that gas gauge theory is circumstantial as hell . I 've only got one concern now .
MINI: What ?
MARTIN: Rudell . If a jury knew we were a couple , we 've both got a motive and that changes everything .
MINI: Baby , do n't worry about him , he 's just jealous 'cause you 've still got rockin ' abs and a bette hairline .
MINI: Oh , hey , come and watch . You 're missing me , I 'm on TV !
MARTIN: What ? Why ?
MINI: Hurry up , the commercial 's almost over !
HOST: Welcome back to Absolutely Positive . Now it 's time to hear how the date between Jason and Mini ended .
MARTIN: You ? You went on-
MINI: Yeah , I thought it 'd be a gasnow shhh
HOST: Jason , you said that the reason you wanted to come on the show was to test your ability to resist temptation .
JASON: Well , since Becky and I have dated since high school and decided to emain virgins until marriage , I just wanted to go on a date with another girl just to see how I would react . You know , whethe there 'd be any feelings of doubt about my decision ?
HOST: So , after dinner , what happened ?
JASON: Oh , gosh , well she suggested we go to a dance club she knew . I 'm not eally a good dancer , but I said `` yes . ''
BECKY: We never go dancing .
HOST: So , Mini , is Jason a good dancer ?
MINI: Martin , for god 's sake , that was their line . You think I talk like that ?
HOST: Oh , really ? So there was some othe teacher-student stuff going on ?
JASON: Uh , no , not really-
MINI: Oh , come on , what about when we went back to your place ?

MINI: Oh , like you 're such a martyr fo eing faithful ? It shows amazing estraint to limit yourself to just one stepdaughter !
MARTIN: Do n't lecture me about fidelity ! Your mother was cheating within six months of the `` I do 's '' !
MINI: Please Look , I 'm sorry , I really am , but this is n't the answer !
MINI: You 're hurting me !
MARTIN: Calm down or I 'll snap it in two , do you hear me ?

MARTIN: What are you doing ! He 'll tell everyone !
OFFICER: Drop the club and put your hands up !
MINI: Thank God ! Thank God , you came !
MARTIN: Mini , you called them ? ! How could you call them ? !

FOREWOMAN: Guilty .

MARTIN: It 's okay , Myou can mail it .
INI: Are you okay ? You look like you have n't showered in days .
MARTIN: Welluhyou have to be careful about sh-So how 's school ?
MINI: You 'll never guess what happened .
MARTIN: What ?
MINI: I was voted valedictorian !
MARTIN: But do n't you have to be-
MINI: The best student ? I know ! But the students took a vote and they said they wanted me to have it fo demonstrating remarkable courage in the face of unspeakable loss .
MARTIN: I wonder how the real valedictorian feels ?
MINI: Like slitting his wrists with the sharp end of a protractor .
MARTIN: Is Rudell out of his coma yet ?
MINI: I do n't know , why ?
MARTIN: Why ? Mini , if he recovers , he may try to lackmail you with those pictures .
MINI: OhI would n't worry about that .
MARTIN: But if the D.A . got those pictures , you could-
MINI: I 'm pretty sure he wo n't be doing anything with them .
MARTIN: Mini , you 're not thinking of sleeping with him to keep him quiet ? Because I 've met people in here who could help us with him , if it comes to that .
MINI: Help us ?
MARTIN: They know people on the outside we couldpay to make sure he does n't try to take advantage of you .
MINI: Oh , gosh , that 's so romantic . It 's like you 're a real life criminal with connections and everything , ut I 'm a little surprised you have n't figured it out yet .
MARTIN: What ?
MINI: Ohwow , like I thought you were just playing along ` cause I 'm you only link to the outside world , but you really do n't know ?
MINI: You remember , Aurelio ?
MARTIN: Our cabana boy from Mexico ?
MINI: What a sweetie , I thought I might have to fuck him , but just giving him the camera was enough .
MARTIN: Youyou
MINI: It was pretty clear Garson was n't gon na give up , and sooner or late he 'd find enough to charge us . It just seemed ridiculous that we 'd oth end up suffering .
MINI: Hey , listen , since conjugal visits are pretty much out of the question , I thought it would be cool if we tried a little prison phone sex .
MARTIN: Guard !
MINI: No ? Are you sure ? I wo n't be able to come back for a few weeks . Wait , have you met someone in here ? !
MARTIN: Guard !
MINI: Why , you old dog ! I knew you would n't be single in here fo long .
MARTIN: Guard ! She did it ! She just admitted it ! It was her idea !

MARTIN: Do n't let her leave ! She 's guilty ! Get the warden !
MARTIN: You bitch ! You little whore !
MINI: Daddy , why are you saying those things !
MARTIN: I 'm gon na kill you ! Do you hear me , you little bitch !
MINI: Daddy , stop ! I love you ! Do n't say that ! I love you !
MINI: While I may not have excelled in the classroom , I think my recent experiences in that bigge schoolhouse we call `` life '' , have taught me a few lessons that I 'd like to share with my fellow graduates .
MALE RIGHT: `` Johnny , please . Johnny please . ''
FEMALE: You 're scaring me .
MALE RIGHT: I do n't like you any more , Carol .
FEMALE: Put the scissors down . You 're scaringme . Please. < /U
MALE RIGHT: Oh , Carol .
FEMALE: Johnny ! Stop !
MALE RIGHT: Do n't grab at me ! Let
MALE LEFT: Daddy ! No !
ALL THREE: Murderer !
JOHNNY: Why 'd you let me sleep so long ?
CAROL: It 's Saturday , Johnny , you always Why are you staring at me like that ?
JOHNNY: I 'm unhappy that you let me sleep so long .
JOHNNY: I did n't do anything !
OFFICER 1: Come out of the closet on your hands and knees .
JOHNNY: I did n't
OFFICER 1: John Palmer , if you were being arrested for any other crime , I would now read you your rights . But you are under arrest for the future murderer of your wife , Carol Palmer . You have no rights . Johnny , on his hands and knees , goes limp .
WITWER: Thought we might a had a runner .
ANDERSON: Yeah , a runner .
WITWER: A little chase that 'd been good .
ANDERSON: Fifty cops on the scene takes the chase out of them .
WITWER: But only eight of us were real . Witwer dematerializes the last decoy .
ANDERSON: We ever get a runner , I 'd be too old to give chase .
WITWER: You 'd chase . You 'd love it , . Man .
ANDERSON: I love it more Johnny boy does n't get to murder his wife .
WITWER: It 's a beautiful world .
LISA: Jesus , Paul . Your heart 's hammering . I excite you that much ?
ANDERSON: I used to love being a cop .
LISA: You 're still a cop . I 'm a factory worker . We do n't catch murderers . We process them .
ANDERSON: Great except there 's no such thing as homicide . What I do best does n't exist anymore .
LISA: PAUL . You 're the Director of a perfect system . A Cop with a perfect record
ANDERSON: The Precogs have a perfect record . They identify the accused I just put on my monkey suit and go round them up . Lisa hugs him , kisses the back of his neck .
LISA: And then I prosecute them . And they go to jail . And lives are saved . Thousands of lives . And that 's a cop 's dream .
ANDERSON: No . You 're a cop 's dream .
LISA: No one . I called about my hair . Getting it done this afternoon .
ANDERSON: Come on in , neighbor . Want some coffee ?
FRANK D'IGNAZIO: Brought these for your supper .
LISA: Oh , Frank . That 's so sweet . Thank you .
FRANK D'IGNAZIO: Sweet , nothing . I got ta get rid of these things . One plant , and I 'm invaded by tomatoes . When I was a kid
ANDERSON: Before all this genetically engineered crap Frank gives him an ornery look , then a smile .
FRANK D'IGNAZIO: Yeah well , it 's true . It used to be a challenge to grow things . An art . Now you put one plant in the ground then jump the hell out of the way . Anderson gestures for Frank to sit down .
ANDERSON: Coffee ?
FRANK D'IGNAZIO: Nah , thanks . Ca n't stay . You guys are rushing off to work anyway . Lisa sets the eggs down in front of Anderson .
LISA: You and Ellie come for supper then .
ANDERSON: We 'll barbecue . Frank nods and pushes on the screen door .
FRANK D'IGNAZIO: You betcha . We 'll bring some more tomatoes a new batch will have grown by then .
ANDERSON: Where 's Ennis Page ? Why has n't he delivered this morning 's Precog discs ?
WITWER: Bullying the staff again , Directo Anderson ?
ANDERSON: Screw you .
WITWER: The Johnny Palmer bust ?
ANDERSON: Yeah .
WITWER: It was okay . We got our man .
ANDERSON: When do we not get our man ?
PAGE: Sorry I 'm late , sir . Precogs put out a heavy national volume this morning four for our zone .
ANDERSON: Put the case on my desk , Ennis .
WITWER: Now that 's a guy who really cares. < /U
TOUR GUIDE: Welcome to the main headquarters of Precrime . Smaller Precrime branches are scattered throughout the United States .
MR. HARRIS: Three . Uh , right ?
TOUR GUIDE: That 's exactly right ! A lot of people assume there are Precogs in every anch office .
TIMMY: They protect us . The guide tousles his hair .
TOUR GUIDE: That 's right , Timmy . Because of the Precogs , you 're going to grow up murderfree . Is n't that something ?
MR. HARRIS: They ever wrong ? The Precogs eve screw up when they predict a murder ? The guide laughs tolerantly .
TOUR GUIDE: Never , sir . It 's an infallible system . The Precogs predict a homicide , and our Precrime police then apprehend that future murdere efore the event occurs . And right next door is the Judicial Center , where we prosecute the future murderers .
TIMMY: Can we see the Precogs ?
TOUR GUIDE: No , I 'm sorry . That part of the uilding is not open to the public . Now , if you 'll just step this way
ANDERSON: What would they think about if we unhooked them ?
PAGE: They do n't think , sir . They just see . Anderson is silent .
LISA: Director Anderson , do you swear that the disc you now present to the court is the only and authentic disc of the future murder of Carol Palmer by her husband , John Palmer ?
ANDERSON: Yes . This is the only and authentic disc of the event seen by the Precognitive mutants and recorded by the Precrime Division . This is the immutable evidence of the infallible system .
LISA: The murder of Carol Palmer will occu
ANDERSON: In one week June 16th , 2040 at 10 33 in the morning .
CAROL: Johnny , please
JOHNNY: `` Johnny , please . Johnny please . ''
CAROL: You 're scaring me .
JOHNNY: I do n't like you any more , Carol .
CAROL: Put the scissors down . You 're scaring me . Please .
JOHNNY: I did n't do it . I 'm innocent ! It did n't happen ! The JUDGE hits his gavel .
JUDGE: How does the defense plead ?
DEFENSE ATTORNEY: The defense acknowledges the infallibility of the system . We are Guilty . We throw ourselves at the mercy of the court .
JOHNNY: No ! No ! The Precogs are wrong ! No !
WITWER: Looks like the old days .
ANDERSON: That would be bad news for an infallible system . Witwer is suddenly bored .
WITWER: We know it ca n't be a murder the Precogs would 've seen it . Why do you insist on coming to these things ?
ANDERSON: Keeps the system honest . And besides , I like to pretend I 'm a cop . Anderson turns to an officer .
OFFICER: Right here , sir .
ANDERSON: Hi DOC .
HOLOGRAPHIC DOCTOR: Hello , Director Anderson .
WITWER: This a homicide , Doc ?
HOLOGRAPHIC DOCTOR: I 'm presently analyzing neurohormones , Assistant Director Witwer . I have not concluded my examination .
WITWER: Bingo . The guy put the gun to his own head .
HOLOGRAPHIC DOCTOR: I have not determined that yet , Assistant Director . Witwer grins .
WITWER: You have good ears for a ghost , Doc . The coroner crab steps away from the body .
HOLOGRAPHIC DOCTOR: Please rotate the corpse to the lateral supine position .
WITWER: Can you imagine if this was a homicide ? Who even knows how to hunt down a killer any more ? Anderson gives him a hard look .
WITWER: Easy , partner . But you know what I 'm saying . The state legislatures are pushing to stop funding for training homicide detectives
ANDERSON: God bless the Precogs . The Doctor opens his eyes .
HOLOGRAPHIC DOCTOR: This event is a negative homicide . A mortal wound was generated by a .22 calibre bullet self-delivered to the parietal 'portion of the skull on June 10th , 2040 , at 11 57 pm ,
WITWER: It 's time to stop coming to these , partner .
ANDERSON: Yeah . You 're right .
LISA: It 's only a party , Paul .
ANDERSON: I 'd never have let them appoint me to Precrime if I 'd have known this was going to be part of it .
LISA: You 're exactly what Precrime needed . An amazing homicide cop and a real person in an unreal job .
LISA: The public loves the Precogs . But they give people the creeps , too . You 're something they understandp a regular cop running things .
ANDERSON: Let 's invite all these irregula assholes over for a barbecue . Burgers and beer - think they 'd come ?
SENATOR MALCOLM: I 'd come , Mr. Director . And I 'd make all the other assholes come with me .
ANDERSON: I know you do , Senator .
SENATOR MALCOLM: Hundreds of Precogs . Not just predicting murders , but predicting U > all crimes . Burglary , arson , assaults
ANDERSON: How about jaywalking ? Littering ? Now there 's a crime . The Senator smiles through his teeth .
SENATOR MALCOLM: I do n't want a police state , you know that . But we have an opportunity here , and
ANDERSON: No sir , we do n't have that opportunity . There are only three Precogs . They 're a lucky accident of nature . There are no more .
SENATOR MALCOLM: We can make more . Just give me you support . Help me increase funding for the Precog Engineering Project .
ANDERSON: Precogs are n't sheep or pigs . Seeing into the future is a gift , a nonreproducible event .
SENATOR MALCOLM: Fuck Mozart . The people want to be safe . They want that more than they want food or love .
ANDERSON: Senator , a world filled with hundreds of Precogs is not my idea of a safe place . The Senator gives it one last shot .
SENATOR MALCOLM: Sure could use your help , Paul .
ANDERSON: I decline , Senator . I 'm sorry .
SENATOR MALCOLM: Do n't think I 'll come to your barbecue after all .
DR. RESFIELD: You do n't get out here much .
ANDERSON: Not my sort of place . Dr. Resfield emits a dry little laugh .
DR. RESFIELD: The head of Precrime squeamish ?
ANDERSON: When it comes to needles and scalpels , yeah .
DR. RESFIELD: I promise we wo n't use any on you .
ANDERSON: What do you use them on ?
DR. RESFIELD: On bits of this and that .
ANDERSON: What 's happening here ?
DR. RESFIELD: We 're in an interesting phase .
ANDERSON: What 's in the cylinders ?
DR. RESFIELD: Neurotissue .
ANDERSON: From ?
DR. RESFIELD: A fusion of sources . From the Precogs ' deceased mother . From the Precogs themselves .
ANDERSON: A fusion of ?
DR. RESFIELD: In lay terms , we mated sperm from the brothers with ova from the mothe and sister to create new growth .
FRANK D'IGNAZIO: What are you doing , playing hooky ?
ANDERSON: It 's great out here , Frank.. You got the touch . Frank straightens with a grimace .
FRANK D'IGNAZIO: I got the arthritis , is what I got .
ANDERSON: Sure , Frank . Yeah .
FRANK D'IGNAZIO: I thought I 'd buried it all . Thirty-five years all those minutes and days to bury it . But suddenly you see the man who murdered your daughter walking the streets my God it throws you .
ANDERSON: He 'd served his time , Frank . I know it 's not fair . It 's way beyond not fair Frank looks . At Anderson bitterly .
FRANK D'IGNAZIO: God damn the Precogs . You know ? Why could n't they have been around to save my girl ? Now they 're catching me .
ANDERSON: Next Wednesday , at noon .
FRANK D'IGNAZIO: Good . Anderson 's cop eyes are all over the gun .
ANDERSON: It 's not in you , Frank , to kill anybody .
FRANK D'IGRAZIO: Tell it to the Precogs . It 's set in stone now , right ?
FRANK D'IGNAZIO: I do n't want to be a part of this world anymore .
ANDERSON: I know , Frank .
FRANK D'IGNAZIO: So . Tell me , Paul . Do the Precogs see everything ?
ANDERSON: No .
FRANK D'IGRAZIO: Then they wo n't have seen this .
WITWER: We had to bring him in . Anderson does n't respond .
ANDERSON: You blame him ? The guy killed his daughter !
WITWER: Precrime did the job it was supposed to do .
ANDERSON: That 's why I got into this business to be hated .
WITWER: They hated us when we were regula cops . Now we 're Precrime , and they still hate US . It 's one of the little perks of law enforcement nobody knows about .
ANDERSON: Oh , Ed
ALL THREE: Murderer !
ANGELA: Sir ?
ANDERSON: Come in . Angela .
ANGELA: Need you to sign these . And you eleven o'clock starts in five minutes .
ANDERSON: My eleven .
ANGELA: Budget coordination with the FBI . You okay , sir ?
ANDERSON: Have Page take this . Angela steps back , disturbed .
ANGELA: But sir , the procedure
ANDERSON: I 'll speak to Witwer , put him in charge for the rest of the day .
WITWER: Breaking and entering . That 'll get you five to ten , hard .
ANDERSON: Take over for me today ?
WITWER: You sick ?
ANDERSON: Yeah . Witwer makes a show of backing away .
WITWER: Do n't give it to me . You probably have that Trans-10 virus going around . A stomach thing . I hate stomach things . Anderson Almost smiles .
ANDERSON: Ed .
WITWER: Yeah ?
ANDERSON: Run the place , okay ?
WITWER: Sure . Right into the ground . Go on home before I call Infectious Control and have them spray you down with something .
ANDERSON: Ca n't let them back up . Do 'em .
WITWER: Call you later . Take it easy , all ight ?
LISA: Paul ?
ANDERSON: Listen to me . Lisa presses her phone close to her ear .
LISA: I can hardly hear you .
ANDERSON: I 'm underground . Weakens the signal so it ca n't be picked up . Alarm moves across her face .
LISA: But we 're on Secure
ANDERSON: Listen , dammit ! I 'm going to murde Ed . The Precogs picked it up . On Lisa can she have heard right ?
LISA: Paul . Paul His crackling voice faintly comes through the phone .
ANDERSON'S VOICE: home . Lisa 's phone goes dead .
POLICE OFFICER: Hello , sir . Anderson nods , moves close .
ANDERSON: What 's your name , officer ?
POLICE OFFICER: Bob , uh , Robert Smythe .
ANDERSON: These the new Python transports ?
LISA: It 's a hundred degrees in here .
ANDERSON: I turned the furnace all the way up . Your hair dryer . The oven . If they come , it 'll buy me twenty seconds . Maybe thirty .
LISA: Nobody 's coming for you . Anderson stares at her .
ANDERSON: I 'm going to kill Ed Witwer .
LISA: It 's not true. < /U
ANDERSON: One week from today . Tuesday , June 25 , at five-twenty in the morning . I shoot him , Lisa .
LISA: You need to take time off . Anderson laughs harshly .
ANDERSON: You do n't have to worry about that . She steps toward him .
LISA: I want to hold you .
ANDERSON: If you love me , stand there . And U > do n't move . Tears well in her eyes .
LISA: Something 's wrong . You would n't do it .
ANDERSON: The Precogs are never wrong . They emit a single disc . `` The immutable evidence of the infallible system . ''
LISA: We 'll figure this out . We 'll review the system .
ANDERSON: There is no review . There 's only the disc . It Shows My guilt . There 's no defense . Her long hair . He stares .
LISA: You ca n't run . Please , let 's
ANDERSON: Last week . It was strange . I watched from the bathroom window . You went out in the backyard to make a call . She looks at him .
LISA: Stop it ! Paul , please . You 're U > panicking . Everything 's going to look wrong . You 're going to distrust everybody and everything now . Lisa implores him .
ANDERSON: Ed . why outside ? Why lie about it ?
LISA: Stop being a cop and listen to me !
OFFICER 1: He 's got a hair dryer going . Screwed up my reading . The others nod .
OFFICER 2: We 're not picking up shit .
VOICE: Paul Anderson 0256 clear .
CIA CRONIN: The central question is Why does Anderson want to kill Witwer ?
FBI SWANSON: Personnel checks reveal no ambitious coups planned by you to topple him . He 's done nothing to you , or you to him . Witwer presses his lips together .
WITWER: No .
JUSTICE POLLARD: So , you are friends , partners , and soul mates . Anderson has no motive .
WITWER: I ca n't think of one . Maybe JUSTICE POLLARD The Precogs are mistaken ?
JUSTICE POLLARD: You do n't believe that , do you ?
WITWER: No . The Precogs are infallible . Senator Malcolm is impatient with all this .
SENATOR MALCOLM: You 're goddam right . So , gentlemen -screw the motive . We got a pre-murderer on the run , and a nasty little PR problem .
WITWER: Now look Cronin talks right over him .
CIA CRONIN: The public must believe that every future murderer is pursued with equal vigor .
FBI SWANSON: Therefore , Precrime will put in charge the man best suited to the job . And who would pursue a murderer harde than his intended victim ?
JUSTICE POLLARD: You went after Anderson yesterday -because it was right , and because you believe. < /U Almer speaks with a tight irony .
WITWER: He knows Precrime , of course . And the streets he 's rusty , but he 'll emember how to work them . It 'll come back to him fast . He 's the est .
JUSTICE POLLARD: We 're not here to praise Caesar we 're here to bury him .
WITWER: He ca n't avoid iris identification . Every door he opens , every ATM he uses , or taxi or transport he boards he 'll get scanned . It wo n't take long to find him .
TECHNICIAN: It 's Anderson . Witwer grabs a phone , punches a button
WITWER: Paul !
TECHNICIAN 2: He 's been Scanned . He 's on the 33rd Street Subway !
TECHNICIAN: His cell phone tracks for The Sprawl . We got him on the Subway , too !
ANDERSON: Why am I going to kill you , Ed ?
WITWER: There 's no motive
ANDERSON: My wife calling you before breakfast ?
WITWER: We were planning a surprise party . It was going to be today . Happy birthday , partner .
ANDERSON: This party 's no fun , Ed . It 's a hell of a surprise , though . I 'm having trouble trusting people , Ed , I got ta tell you .
OFFICER: The train makes two stops , here and here 20th , then 33rd Street . Witwer covers the Mouthpiece
WITWER: Split the units , go to both
OFFICER: We 'll never make 20th
ANDERSON: You there , Ed ?
WITWER: I 'm here . You got ta come in , Paul .
ANDERSON: I 'm a Cop , Ed . I need a motive .
WITWER: Come in . We 'll figure this thing out together .
ANDERSON: I saw a news flash . You 're the new Director . Is that the point of this ?
WITWER: Fuck you . Anderson smiles .
ANDERSON: Did n't think so . But it has to be U > something , Ed .
WITWER: Paul . Come in .
ANDERSON: If I come in , it puts me close to you . If I get close I may kill you . I ca n't risk that . Anyway , they 'd force you to lock me up . And that 'd be it I 'd neve get my chance to solve this thing . Witwer needs to keep him talking
WITWER: You 're kinds liking this , in a way , are n't you ? The action
ANDERSON: And you get to be a real cop again . We get to flex our muscles .
TECHNICIAN 2: We have visual verification he 's still on the train .
ANDERSON'S VOICE: I want to tell you something , partner . You listening ?
WITWER: Yeah .
ANDERSON'S VOICE: I got ta do this . I have to figure this thing out . But listen to me now . If it was you < /U unning , I 'd come after you , Ed .
WITWER: You would n't shoot a cop would you , Paul ? Paul ? Paul ? He looks urgently to the phone technician
TECHNICIAN 1: He 's still on the line .
DOC: Got a cold .
ANDERSON: I 'm not here for cat surgery , Doc . Doc chuckles . Then he waits , expectantly .
DOC: Yeah . All right .
ANDERSOIN: I 'm a cop , I know
DOC: I got ta take your eyes out .
ANDERSON: Yeah . I get it , DOC .
DOC'S VOICE: Do n't take the bandages off for twenty four hours . You 'll go blind if you do .
DOC: You 're in a room . I had you moved here , a couple miles from my place . If they find you , they do n't find me . Anderson grunts weakly .
ANDERSON: ) Nano-re construction .
DOC: Organic microrobots that reconstruct nerves and blood vessels . It 'll feel like fleas chewing on you eyeballs . Do n't scratch .
ANDERSON: Jesus .
DOC: You tighten up again in about thirty minutes . Hurts like nothing you ever felt . It 's vicious , but effective . I 'll put it in your bag .
ANDERSON: I 'm hungry , but sick to my stomach .
ANDERSON: Fuck .
OFFICER 1: Got 27 warm bodies in this place . What should it take , three or fou Spiders ?
OFFICER 2: Do four . Speed things up , so we can go eat .
OLD WOMAN: It 's nice to have a little company
OFFICER 1: Stinking drunk .
OFFICER 2: Or a guy who does n't want to get ead .
OFFICER 1: Let 's eat .
WITWER: They told me to move into Paul 's office . I said fuck you very much . Lisa nods .
LISA: I know . I know that .
WITWER: Yeah . But if he shoots a cop Which is what he does four days from now , is n't it ?
LISA: He 'd never hurt you .
WITWER: I know that . But the other thing I know is the Precogs are neve wrong .
DRIVER: Welcome aboard , Mr. Symington . Plenty of seats in the back .
ANDERSON: Time to upgrade your alarm system , Senator .
SENATOR MALCOLM: There 's no motive .
ANDERSON: There 's , always a motive .
SENATOR MALCOLM: What the fuck was I worried about ? You ca n't kill me . The Precogs would 've seen it .
ANDERSON: Tell you something about the Precogs , Senator . They 're great on murder . But it 's the little things they fail to see .
WITWER: He has n't shown up on one goddamn IdentiScan in three days .
LIEUTENANT GLASER: He 's found a room he 's going to sit it out .
WITWER: Yeah , except for holding a gun to senator Malcolm 's goddman head in his own goddman house last night , Anderson 's sitting it out ! U > Why has n't he been scanned ? The officers look at their shoes .
LIEUTENANT GLASER: He ’ s beating the scanners
WITWER: No one beats the scanners .
LIEUTENANT GLASER: But the scarring always

PAGE: You ca n't make copies Anderson waits . Lets Page work through it .
ANDERSON: Ennis you gave out the same disc twice . Less than an hour apart . The one I stole . And then anothe one . Of the same event .

DIGITAL VOICE: Have a nice night , Mr. Symington
YOUNG GUY: Hey ! Hey , you ca n't
ANDERSON: It 's me .
LISA: Paul . Lisa grips the phone and turns to the wall
ANDERSON: Your phone will be bugged . So we ca n't meet , we ca n't do anything . Just listen . Nowing you 're listening is enough .
LISA: No .
ANDERSON: I know . Witwer sent them . He saw the disc and had to do his job . Tell me you forgive me . Please .
LISA: Of course , I forgive you .
ANDERSON: All these people I need to forgive me . Do you think Frank forgave me ? All I could do for him was send him gardenias . I love you .
LISA: Frank hated gardenias .

OFFICER: They 're off homicides . They 're edirecting them to help us locate you .
ATTENDANT: You all right in there ?
TOUR GUIDE: Welcome to the main headquarters of Precrime . Smaller Precrime branches are scattered throughout the United States .
WITWER: What is it ?
TECHNICIAN: Must be a glitch
WITWER: What ? < /U
TECHNICIAN: Anderson just got IdentiScanned .
WITWER: Where is he ? The technician looks up at Witwer .
TECHNICIAN: But he 's had his eyes done . Right ? Sir ? Tries to think it through .
WITWER: He had to have .
TECHNICIAN: Jesus Christ , sir . He 's in the asement of this building .
WITWER: This is ridiculous. < /U Lieutenant Glaser replies forcefully
LIEUTENANT GLASER: Standing orders from the Security Panel , sir .
WITWER: If he wants to get to me , he 'll get to me .
LIEUTENANT GLASER: No , he wo n't , sir .
TECHNICIAN: Do n't worry , air -emergency generators will kick on in five seconds .
WITWER: Explanation , please !
TECHNICIAN: Uh , sir . It seems he got the generators , too .
VOICE: Shit .
FEMALE: Save us , Anderson .
ANDERSON: I have to get out of here .
FEMALE: Save us .
ANDERSON: You let me get here , did n't you ? You stopped giving them information , so they could n't track me .
FEMALE: Save
LISA: Help me , Paul .
WITWER: Why did n't the Precogs know he was coming to do this ?
LIEUTENANT GLASER: We wo n't let that happen , sir .
WITWER: You wo n't , huh ?
TECHNICIAN: They 're a hive mind , sir . It takes three for their predictive abilities to be fully operational .
WITWER: These two are all I have to find the man who is about to murder me . Hook them up , and flood them with whateve kind of fucking chemicals you have to . They are a machine , and I need that machine at my disposal .
LISA: Your IdentiScan is off , Ennis . I could just walk in here .
PAGE: I forgot . To turn it on . She sits down beside him .
LISA: You do n't look surprised to see me .
PAGE: He took one of my babies .
LISA: He 's desperate , Ennis . He had to . We have to help him .
PAGE: I delivered a fake .. to him ?
LISA: But he thought it was real , and ran with it .

ANDERSON: You did n't even look around . You knew .
FEMALE: We can sense each other . You must save
ANDERSON: Stop . I saved You . It was the best I could do .
FEMALE: Thank you , Anderson .
ANDERSON: What am I going to do with you ? Her eyes grow very serious .
FEMALE: Name me , Anderson .
ANDERSON: What ?
FEMALE: Give me a name . I 've never had one .
ANDERSON: Listen . She turns to the wall .
FEMALE: Rose .
ANDERSON: Rose . They shifted your precognition so you would locate me .
ROSE: Yes . And it hurt us , physically . Did you know that ? The helmets , the controls . It hurts. < /U
ANDERSON: I did n't know .
ROSE: We saw our chance . You would need to shut us down , you would have to come . We wanted you to come .
ANDERSON: You used me to save you .
ROSE: I have been used all my life , Anderson . Anderson ca n't meet her eyes .
ANDERSON: Rose . What 's going to happen to us ? Can you see that ?
ROSE: I 'm weak . And away from my brothers . I see glimpses and hints of things nearby . But it 's all scattered . I 'm tired of the future , Anderson .
ANDERSON: You did n't know I was going to do that , did you ? She is almost too overwhelmed to speak
ROSE: No . Oh , Anderson . It was lovely . And now it is Anderson who is overwhelmed
LIEUTENANT GLASER: Who else could it 've been ?
WITWER: Page worshipped the system . He fell apart . Shot himself . The Lieutenant rolls his eyes .
LIEUTENANT GLASER: Anderson .
HOLOGRAPHIC DOCTOR: Director Witwer . This event is a positive homicide .
LISA: There .
WITWER: A fake .
BEAT: But the Precogs predict the infallible truth . They do n't emit fake discs .
LISA: Exactly . You ca n't tamper with the Precogs , induce them to make fakes
WITWER: Bypass the Precogs and slip a fake disc in with that day 's real ones
LISA: We 're all programmed to believe anything we see on a Precog disc . The system has never been wrong
WITWER: It 's gone too far , Lisa She shakes her head , shocked at his response
LISA: He was set up ! You both were . If Paul kills you , you 're both out of the picture .
LISA: Jesus , Ed . Stop this thing ! And then we can investigate Witwer 's mouth opens and closes . He tries again .
WITWER: Ennis Page was murdered last night . The blood drains from Lisa 's face
LISA: He 's not a murderer .
WITWER: I think he is . A murderer and a future murderer . Lisa . What does it matter that the first disc is a fake if the second one 's real ?
ANDERSON: Rose . Listen to me . I 'm going to leave you here . I have to keep moving .
ROSE: No . You must save my brothers .
ANDERSON: It 's impossible . There 's no time . I 've done what I can do !
ROSE: Come here , Anderson . He does , reluctantly .
ANDERSON: You knew it was n't impossible . That I 'd get there . Rose reveals nothing .
ROSE: You are a man who saves others . Save my brothers .
ANDERSON: I 'm in a lot of trouble right now .
ROSE: My brothers are in more trouble . They 've moved them to an awful place .
ANDERSON: Rose . Ed Witwer -he 's in the most trouble of all . Who saves him ?
DR. RESFIELD: We 're not really set up for this type of
ANDERSON: Rose . Try to drink .
ROSE: Your wife . We have to get her here , Anderson .
ANDERSON: Why ?
ROSE: I do n't know
ANDERSON: What are you seeing ?
ROSE: Glimpses , Anderson . Please . We have to get her here .
ANDERSON: You 're scaring me , Rose She covers his mouth with her hand
ROSE: Stop talking . It uses me up .
SECRETARY: Sir ? I 'm sorry , she stepped out fo a few minutes . Sir ?
LISA: Hello ? Hello ?
ANDERSON'S VOICE: I need you .
MORE: He 's wearing a red tie . He has short lond hair .
LISA: Two hundred dollars if you do n't scan me .
MAN: You bite me , bitch , I 'll pull you teeth out .
LISA: Cut it a little close there , honeybunch .
ANDERSON: Rose got the street wrong . She 's getting weak .
LISA: Rose ?
ANDERSON: Two discs . One fake . One real .
LISA: I do n't think there were supposed to e two . Whoever planned it , was n't counting on two .
ANDERSON: An infallible system . Every disc ever generated has been true
LISA: Somebody wants you out of the way so they make a fake disc . Who eve doubts the discs ?
ANDERSON: I never doubted it . I saw it . And elieved it , absolutely . I was certain I was going to murder Witwer .
LISA: And generated the second disc . The eal one .
ANDERSON: A self-fulfilling prophesy . I elieved it was true . And that made it true .
ROSE: We see what we see . I 'm sorry , Anderson . It 's been predicted .
LIEUTENANT GLASER: We ca n't take chances , si Witwer does n't move or answer .
WITWER: The event . Lieutenant Glaser shifts uncomfortably
LIEUTENANT GLASER: I 've been ordered to get you onto the craft . By force if necessary .
WITWER: The event is inevitable , Lieutenant . Witwer does n't turn around .
LIEUTENANT GLASER: I do n't leave this room without you , sir . The Security Panel insists .
ANDERSON: Nobody could slip a fake disc past Ennis Page Lisa shakes her head .
LISA: He was the weak link in the perfect system .
ANDERSON: Obsessive compulsive niners ca n't allow changes in the routine
LISA: Something threw him off . He tried to tell me . It did n't make any sense . Something about `` spilled coffee . '' Someone was in his office with him . And coffee spilled
ANDERSON: Rose . What is it ?
ROSE: We were n't just lost in the future . We were in the Chamber , too . Ou eyes were open . In the present .
ANDERSON: Your eyes were open . What did you see , Rose ?
ROSE: Who would I have told ? Who eve talked to us ? Who cared that we could talk ?
ANDERSON: Rose . Who spilled the coffee ? Straight ahead Rose stares stright ahead
ANDERSON: Ed Lisa turns , and speaks softly to her husband .
LISA: The perfect system -brought down by a cup of coffee . My god .
ANDERSON: He set into motion his own death . He did n't know it would go this far . What makes me leave this room ? If I stay here I wo n't kill him . Right ?
WITWER: You see , if you think you can put me on a hovercraft and save me , then you do n't believe in the infallibility of the Precog system .
OFFICER: Sir . Should you be here ?
WITWER: There 's been a development . A body 's een found in the Sprawl .
OFFICER: Anderson 's ?
WITWER: They 're checking it out . I need to see what the Precogs have seen .
DR.RESFIELD: You should n't be here , Director .
WITWER: No , no . This is exactly where I should be .
DR. RESFIELD: You 're under a lot of strain , Director .
WITWER: And tv 's so good for that soothes the mind .
DR. RESFIELD: We 're getting nothing from them .
WITWER: And that 's because ? Witwer still grips him by the elbow .
DR. RESFIELD: I do n't know .
WITWER: Do you think they know where Anderson is ?
DR. RESFIELD: It 's impossible to tell . We 've done everything . Maybe even too much .
WITWER: They know how to find Anderson fo me .
ANDERSON: Jesus Christ .
LISA: Come on , Rose .
ANDERSON: One hour . We hold it together fo an hour , Witwer lives and I 'm not a murderer .
LISA: She wo n't last an hour .
ANDERSON: Rose !
ROSE: He 's killed him , Anderson !
ANDERSON: Did he kill both of them , Rose ? Rose !
ROSE: Does it matter , Anderson ? Anderson rises . Looks down at Rose . It matters . He starts to move , quickly . Lisa takes hold of his arm .
LISA: If you leave this room Anderson kisses her .
ANDERSON: Then I 'm a cop , just trying to do hisjob . He reaches for his duffel bag .
WITWER: Is he coming ? No ? Yes ? Maybe ? I think yes . The Precog looks at him .
ANDERSON: There 's never anything good on , you know ? Now Witwer smiles .
WITWER: There . That 's the old Paul .
ANDERSON: You 're not the old Ed . You 've lost it .
WITWER: You lost it . You went weak in the knees , partner .
ANDERSON: I 'm not your partner .
WITWER: The air went out of you when Frank D'Ignazio killed himself .
ANDERSON: He was guilty . I accepted that .
WITWER: No you did n't . The doubts were creeping in on you . The lab trying to engineer more Precogs Malcolm pressuring you to expand
ANDERSON: Never been my style . Witwer gives him the flicker of a smile
WITWER: Precrime needs to grow . You would have stood in its way . The Security Panel would n't have understood that . What you 're capable of . What a U > bulldog you are . Look what you 've been doing to us all week . Amazing . You 're the best .
ANDERSON: So you took matters into your own hands .
WITWER: I understood the threat . I understood
ANDERSON: You killed a Precog . You ended the system you wanted to protect .
WITWER: Wrong . This lab will make more . U > Believe it , Paul . They look at the CLOCK . Five-nineteen .
ANDERSON: Knowing the exact moment of you death -it 's made you crazy , Ed .
WITWER: You sonofabitch ! Anderson lifts up both hands
ANDERSON: That 's right . No gun .
WITWER: You see ? ! That 's exactly what I 'm talking about . You do n't Believe ! Anderson just looks at Witwer , raging at him .
ANDERSON: You ca n't have it both ways . You do n't want to die . That 's why you lured me here to kill me first .
WITWER: Pick it up
ANDERSON: Let 's not do this , Ed Witwer trains his gun on Anderson . Anderson trains his gun on Witwer .
WITWER: Now do you believe ?
ROSE: James . Can you guess what I 'm thinking ?

LORENZO: You know Gary , the guy who was working here before you , the cops found him dead in a subway station in Harlem . I never liked him too much , but poo guy , he did n't deserve to go like that
BEN: Did they mention the cause of death ?
LORENZO: No they would n't tell me . Lorenzo hands him over the keys .
BEN: Have a good night , Lorenzo .
BEN: Damn What is happening to me ?
AMY: Are you OK ? What 's happening ? What are you doing here ?
BEN: Amy , I need you to do me a favor
AMY: Listen , I am in the middle of work , I do n't really have time now .
BEN: I need your help It wo n't take more than twenty minutes . Please , Amy ?
AMY: Why do you want to see him ?
BEN: He used to work at the Mayflower as a night watchman , before I replaced him .
AMY: Where did you get his driver 's license ?
BEN: I found his wallet in the department store . I need to find out how he died
AMY: You are no longer a cop , Ben . This is n't your business anymore .
BEN: He sent me a package before he died , with newspaper articles about the Mayflower I think he was trying to tell me something I do n't know him . I 've never even met him , Amy I need to figure this out .
YOUNG DOCTOR: Gary Lewis Gary Lewis Oh , there he is , 58B He slashed his throat
AMY: There you go There 's your answer . Your man committed suicide .
BEN: You know a lot of people who cut thei own throats ?
YOUNG DOCTOR: Well , all I know is that the cops are still investigating this one . That 's why we still have the body . People can e very creative when it comes to suicide . I 'm sure it 's not the craziest thing you 've seen .
AMY: I 've got to get back to work , Ben . They 're waiting for me upstairs .
BEN: How What did he slit his throat with ? The doctor checks the report .
YOUNG DOCTOR: With with a piece of mirror . Ben looks up .
GARY: ESSSEKERRR
AMY: Are you OK , Ben ? What 's going on ?
BEN: I need to see his files
AMY: What ? Ben raises his voice .
BEN: I NEED TO SEE HIS FILES !
AMY: Come on , Ben , what is it you 're after ? I am not supposed to show you any file You 're not even allowed to be here . I could get fired for this .
YOUNG DOCTOR: Well , I 'll be off . Amy , you know where to find me if you need me . Amy is left alone with Ben .
AMY: What is happening to you ? What is all this supposed to mean ? What is going on , Ben ?
BEN: I wo n't leave until I see that file .
AMY: What ! ? Ben points to the reflection in the mirror-
BEN: Look at the piece of mirror in his hand . In the reflection of the mirro it 's covered in blood , and look- in eality , it 's clean . Not a drop of lood
AMY: So what ?
BEN: Do n't you find it strange that this mirror does n't reflect an exact image of reality ?
AMY: I ca n't see the difference . It must be an effect of the angle from which the photograph was taken . What is it you are you trying to prove ?
BEN: What if the mirrors were showing us something different ?
AMY: What ? For Christ 's sake , listen to yourself , Ben ! What are you talking about ?
BEN: What if the mirrors were reflecting something that goes beyond reality ?
AMY: OK This is way over my head . I do n't have time for your barfly theories .
BEN: Thanks for your help He 's on his way out , when she holds him back-
AMY: You should go home and get some rest . This guy probably just killed himself ecause he could n't live with himself anymore . It happens to thousands of people , you know
ANGELA: I 'm off Amy called me today , she 's worried about you . What 's happening , Ben ?
BEN: Please , not you
ANGELA: I 'm your sister , you can talk to me . Is it your new job ? That place , the Mayflower , has bad vibes . It 's getting under your skin . Just think about what I told you
BEN: I made a deal , Angie I ca n't just walk out on them like that . I need this job , I need the money . I 'm not going to sleep on your couch for the est of my life !
ANGELA: You wo n't have any trouble finding another one . A daytime job , a regula job
BEN: LEAVE ME ALONE
BEN: Mrs. Lewis Sorry to bother you My name is Ben Carson . I worked with Gary , at Mayflower . Could I come up and talk to you for a few minutes ? Silence .
MRS. LEWIS: 5th floor , apartment 3B The entrance door of the building opens .
BEN: Did he use any drugs ?
MRS. LEWIS: Gary ? Huh-huh ! Never He was a good oy .
BEN: Did you notice anything different , the days prior to his leaving the house , anything unusual in his behavior ?
MRS. LEWIS: Oh yes , but that goes way back to when he started working at Mayflower .
BEN: What kind of changes ?
MRS. LEWIS: He did n't care much for anything anymore . Before , we 'd sit up and watch television together . But once he started that job as a night watchman , he 'd spend all his time-off locked up in his room
BEN: Sleeping ?
MRS. LEWIS: He hardly slept anymore He was way too busy !
BEN: Busy doing what ?
MRS. LEWIS: That , I do n't know I never knew what he was up to She reaches for a picture frame on the chest .
BEN: Is that you standing next to him ?
MRS. LEWIS: Yes , back in the days
BEN: Mrs. Lewis , I found a note that Gary wrote .
MRS. LEWIS: Esseker , is that what you 're saying ? The old lady dwells on it for a moment-
BEN: May I see his room ?
MRS. LEWIS: Yes , of course . Come , follow me , it 's down the hallway , the door at the very end .
BEN: Do you mind if I stay in here for a moment ?
MRS. LEWIS: He would spend hours looking at himself Mrs. Lewis steps up behind him-
BEN: I 'm here Ma'am
MICHAEL: Mom ! Mom !
AMY: What is it Michael ?
MICHAEL: There 's a lady screaming
AMY: Where Michael ?
MICHAEL: There In the mirror
AMY: No , Michael Look , there 's nothing there .
MICHAEL: I saw her mom . I swear I did .
AMY: It was just a nightmare . It 's late , you have to go back to sleep . I 'll turn on the night-light , if you want .
DAISY: Mom , can you leave the door open ?
AMY: Sure sweetheart OK , you two go to sleep now .
ANGELA: Hello Ben ?
ANGELA: Are you sure ?
BEN: Love you too , sis .
LARRY: What is it ?
POLICE INSPECTOR: Look Is n't Ben Carson in the picture ?
LARRY: The water has obliterated most of the marks . No trace of struggle or broken entry , the entrance door was locked .
AMY: He would never have laid a finger on her . When their father died , Ben took care of his sister . Angela meant the world to him .
LARRY: Listen , so far , his statement is pretty consistent with the facts We checked it out , he did place a call from work at 12 30 , and the woman 's downstairs neighbors claim they started noticing the water leakage at around two in the morning . The daytime security guard , Lorenzo Sappeli , confirms he came on after Ben 's shift at seven a.m . The only strange thing , and it may just be a coincidence , is that Ben told Sappeli that he had decided to quit his job , as if he was planning to go away somewhere Did he mention anything about it to you ?
AMY: No , lately , communication has n't quite een our strong point I only found out yesterday that he was staying at his sister 's . What are you going to do with him ?
LARRY: I figure we 'll let him go . At this point we have n't got any real reason to keep him here . And , I think he 's had his share for the day .
AMY: You know what 's gon na happen if you let him go . He wo n't stop here . I know him , he wo n't stop until he finds who did this to her .
LARRY: Listen , where we stand now , we got nothing , not a single clue . I 'm sure he can help us .
AMY: What kind of friend are you ? You are using him . He 's not a cop anymore .
LARRY: He 's still the best one I know , even if he 's one of the suspects .
AMY: You have to see someone Ben . You can not stay in this situation any longer . You need help , psychological support . Ben is not listening . His mind is elsewhere .
BEN: No , I do n't want to put them in any danger .
AMY: What do you mean ?
BEN: I 've got things I need to deal with .
AMY: Ben , look at me ! I do n't want you to get into any trouble . Think about Daisy and Michael . You are not going to solve this case . Please , stay out of it .
BEN: She asked me to quit and they got to her
AMY: What ? Who are you talking about ?
BEN: I know who did this Amy .
AMY: In that case , you have to tell them everything .
BEN: They would n't believe me and neithe would you Goodbye .
AMY: Ben , wait
BEN: Why did you do it ? WHY ? WHY DID YOU
BEN: Look up Esseker Yes , Echo , Sierra , Sierra , Echo , Kilo , Echo , Romeo Esseker . No idea , my guess is that it 's a name No , I have n't got a first name . Yes , in New York . Over the past five or six years . I know it 's hazy ut that 's all I 've got . I already looked it up in the phone book . I also called someone at the IRS and at the DMV , but nothing there . It 's very important Larry . You 'll call me back ? Ok
AMY: Do you want the cereal in your hot chocolate or in a separate bowl ? The little boy does not answer .
MICHAEL: In the chocolate
AMY: In the chocolate , please , mom
MICHAEL: Please , mom . She pours the cereal in his hot chocolate .
DAISY: Yuck , that 's gross , how can you eat that ?
AMY: Come on , come on , let 's get going , o you 're going to be late for school .
DAISY: Mom ?
AMY: What is it sweetheart ?
DAISY: Do you know that Michael has a new friend ?
MICHAEL: No , that 's not true !
AMY: Really , what 's his name ?
MICHAEL: You promised not to tell .
AMY: Does he go to your school ?
MICHAEL: He does n't want me to talk about him .
AMY: Why does n't he want you to talk about him ? Is he a grown up ?
MICHAEL: No
AMY: So , he 's a little boy your age , then ?
DAISY: He lives in the mirror in our room .
AMY: Is it your father who told you that ? Michael remains silent .
MICHAEL: No Mommy .
AMY: OK Come on , come on guys , let 's get our teeth brushed , and our coats on . The first one in the car is the winner .
DR. MORRIS: A feeling of self-hatred , generally triggered by a psychological shock can split the personality in two , hence creating two or more personalities with distinct memories or behavio patterns within the same individual . The patient then has a faulty perception of the existence of two distinct worlds , which are principally the `` real '' word , and the world `` inside the mirror '' .
BEN: Did you consider Terrence innocent ?
DR. MORRIS: In my opinion , he was convinced that he was telling the truth when he claimed he did n't kill his family . I too am convinced that when it happened , Terrence was not himself , ut rather his double , his mirro image , one might say . He enters the archives , followed by Ben-
TERRENCE: In order to to destroy the mirrors . Only fire can destroy a mirror , is n't that right , Doctor ?
DR. MORRIS: What made you think you absolutely had to destroy those mirrors , Terrence ?
TERRENCE: They killed Helen and my three little girls
DR. MORRIS: For what reason ? Why would mirrors want to kill your family ?
TERRENCE: Because I did n't Terrence breaks out in tears .
DR. MORRIS: Did n't do what ?
TERRENCE: They asked me to find Esseker Like they did with the others
DR. MORRIS: Who are the others you 're talking about ?
TERRENCE: I was n't the first one they asked
DR. MORRIS: And what happened ?
TERRENCE: I did n't succeed . I did n't succeed in finding Esseker
BEN: Amy I have to go .
DR. MORRIS: Tell me about Esseker , Terrence . Terrence does n't speak .
DAISY: What are you doing dad ?
BEN: Do n't worry , there 's nothing wrong . Everything is OK
DAISY: But why are you doing that ?
BEN: I 'm doing it to protect you .
AMY: Do you mind telling me what the hell you 're doing ?
BEN: Look Amy , you 've got to trust me , I know what I 'm doing It 's for your own good .
AMY: I want you to stop what you 're doing and get out of our house right now .
BEN: You have to trust me Amy , I 'm not completely crazy These mirrors are dangerous . At first , I thought it was only the ones at the store , but now I know they can get you anywhere . They got Angela I promise I 'll leave the house once I 've taken them all down .
AMY: Do you realize what you 're saying , Ben ? What is wrong with you ? I know that what you 're going through is n't easy . Angela was a part of our lives too , but you have no right to do this to us Ever since your obsession with these damn mirrors the kids are scared to death . Your son has nightmares . He 's scared Ben Your behavior is starting to rub off on him . He 's only 5 years old And I have to protect him .
BEN: Come Amy , come with me , I want to show you something .
AMY: What are you doing with that gun Put it down , BEN PUT IT DOWN RIGHT NOW !
BEN: Wait , look , you 'll see
BEN: But I swear to you I I sawAmy
AMY: Get outnow ! I do n't ever want to see you here again , Ben . And I 'll have the lawyers make sure the same goes fo the kids . You are insane , Ben , and dangerous You 've got to get help .
BEN: Hello , Larry ? It 's me I 'm going to need your help again-
BEN: Talk to you later . Ben hangs up .
LARRY: This ought to make you happy Anna Esseker
BEN: Perfect , Larry . That 's perfect .
LARRY: Everyone 's real edgy up there . You 're still a fuckin ' murder suspect . People are wondering why I let you out . You have to tell me more . What does the history of the Mayflower have to do with the death of your sister ?
BEN: I do n't know exactly . I ca n't tell you , but some really fucked up things started happening to me when I took the job over there . Nothing makes any sense to me either but I have to follow my instinct . Larry notices the broken rear-view mirror-
LARRY: What happened ? Did you have an accident ?
BEN: Anna Esseker Where did you find he files ? Did you go to City Hall ?
LARRY: No , you were wrong about that , they had nothing . All the medical records from St. John 's Hospital are still up there with the unclassified cases . Ben squints at him .
BEN: What ?
LARRY: When the nurses went on their rounds , first thing on the morning of Octobe 6th , they discovered that all the patients had left their rooms during the night and gathered in the main oom . All of them were dead , including the girl . Apparently , they had killed one another A slaughter house Afte that they shut down the place . Nobody ever found out what really happened .
BEN: What about the doctor ? Dr. Kane ?
LARRY: He was arrested . They found him dead on the first day of his hearing . He had slit his wrists with a piece of his cell mirror !
BEN: You 're still alive , are n't you ?
AMY: Come on , come on Let 's go Daisy , Michael ?
BEN: Amy ? What 's wrong ?
BEN: What ?
BEN: I 'm right here , Amy . I 'm here now Thank god you 're alright .
AMY: We ca n't stay here , we have to leave the house now We can go to my mother 's or to a hotel
BEN: Anyplace is gon na have mirrors o windows Anything you can see you self in is dangerous . We have to make the house safe . The only way is to cover all the reflections . If we keep them in the dark we can avoid them . We need paint , we need tape
DAISY: When will you be back , Dad ?
BEN: As quickly as I can , sweetheart . I promise . He kisses Michael who hugs him back-
MICHAEL: I love you , Dad .
AMY: What if you do n't find her ? Maybe she does n't live there anymore ? Maybe she 's really dead .
BEN: They want her , I 'm gon na find he wherever she is . We do n't have any other choice .
AMY: I know . Ben gets into the car .
BEN: Amy , I want you to stay here with the kids until all this is over . All the mirrors are covered , there 's no more danger . I 'll come back as soon as I can .
BEN: Hello Is this the Esseker farmhouse ? The young man nods . A woman 's voice is heard from inside-
WOMAN'S VOICE: What is it Jimmy ?
JIMMY: I do n't know Mom . What can I do for you sir ?
BEN: I am looking for Anna , Anna Esseker .
JIMMY: There 's a man who 's looking for You said Anna ? Anna Esseker , Mom !
JIMMY'S MOTHER: What is it you want with Anna Esseker ?
BEN: I huh I am doing some research for a ook on the history of St. John 's Hospital , in New York
JIMMY'S MOTHER: Jimmy , go tell grandpa that there 's a man here who 'd like to talk to him about his sister .
ROBERT: You know , up to this day , the visions of Anna 's fits still haunt me at night .
BEN: And after the hospital ?
ROBERT: You do n't know ? She died there with all of Kane 's other patients .
BEN: Anna left the hospital two days before the massacre . Kane changed the records to make her disappear .
ROBERT: You 're not a journalist , are you ? What do you want ?
BEN: I want to know . After St. John 's , where did she go ?
ROBERT: Anna came back to live with us for a while
BEN: For a while ? Robert lowers his eyes .
ROBERT: Because Because strange things started to happen in the house
BEN: With Anna ?
ROBERT: No , not with Anna
BEN: With the mirrors ?
ROBERT: Before he died , Kane sent us a lette asking us to keep Anna away from mirrors and that whatever happens she should be in a place where the mirrors could never find her .
BEN: Where is she now ?
ROBERT: To protect us , she left the house and joined the monastic orders , where mirrors are forbidden St. Augustine 's monastery , on the road to Midwich .
SISTER: Yes , how can I help you ?
BEN: Hello Sister . I have come to visit a member of your community Sister Anna ? Her real name is Anna Esseker .
SISTER: Is she expecting you ?
BEN: No , not really .
SISTER: Are you a relative ?
BEN: Listen , Sister , I must see her .
SISTER: If you are not listed , I can not help you sir .
BEN: Please , tell her that I came all the way from New York and that I work with Dr. Kane at St. John 's Hospital
SISTER: Wait here for a moment .
SISTER ANNA: St. John 's closed down in 1952. Who are you ?
BEN: My name is Benjamin Carson . I work as a night watchman at 1229 West 38th Street in New York City , what used to e St. John 's Hospital .
SISTER ANNA: What is it you want Mr. Carson ?
BEN: I need your help .
SISTER ANNA: My help ? I do n't quite see how I could possibly be of any help .
BEN: My wife and children are in danger . What is threatening my family is asking for you
SISTER ANNA: I can not leave the precincts . It 's impossible .
BEN: Tell me why are the mirrors from the old hospital so determined to find you ? Sister Anna remains silent-
SISTER ANNA: It is not the wish of the mirrors to find me , but of what is imprisoned inside them . The mirrors are merely windows on our world
BEN: A window For what ? For whom ?
ANNA: At the time that I was at St. John 's , Dr. Kane 's therapy for personality disorders consisted of locking the patient up in a mirrored room fo several days on end , in order to force him to confront his own image . I spent the darkest days of my life in that oom . On the 6th day the nurses found me lifeless , almost dead . Since that day , I have never had another fit . But deep down inside I 've always known the truth .
BEN: What truth ?
ANNA: There is no cure for schizophrenia , it was something else , Mr. Carson . And whatever it was , it entered the mirror . We can feel the emotion in her voice .
BEN: It entered with you and they need you to get out .
ANNA: The consequences of such an act , Mr. Carson , would be more devastating than letting them suffer where they are now . I 'm going to pray for you and your family . That 's all I can do right now , Mr. Carson . God bless you She stands to leave .
BEN: Wait Please , listen to me- Terence Berry , Gary Lewis and many others efore me Those are the people who died trying to find you . Because they failed , their families died too . My sister was murdered two days ago My wife and kids will next if you do n't come with me . Look-
AMY: Hello ? Ben Where are you ? Did you find her ? Did you talk to
DAISY: What is it Mom ?
AMY: You stay right here sweetheart , I 'm going to look for your brother . Stay ight here . Ben , I have to call you back , I have to find Michael
BEN: Amy ? Amy ? Answer me ?
AMY: Damn it Cautiously , Amy walks up to the bathroom .
BEN: My kids are not going to die tonight . You 're coming with me , now .
ANNA: If I come with you Mr. Carson , you have to promise to do everything I tell you . My way . No questions . Ben lowers his gun-
BEN: You have my word .
AMY: Micha
AMY'S REFLECTION: Come sweetheart Come , come closer Come
DAISY: What are you doing in there , Mom ?
AMY'S REFLECTION: Come closer , do n't worry Everything is all right , sweetheart .
AMY: Michael ? ! Michael ?
DAISY: Why did you do this , Mom ?
AMY: It was n't me Daisy , it was n't me I would never hurt you , you know that .
DAISY: Whewhere is Michael ?
AMY: I do n't know where he is I 'm going to take care of you and then we 're going to find himOK But for now , we have to get out of here .
DAISY: Is Daddy coming back soon ?
AMY: Yes , he 'll be here soon as he can .
MICHAEL: They want to come play with us , Mommy . Amy moves slowly towards her son .
AMY: Michael , I want you to drop that knife , do you hear me ? You know very well you are not allowed to play with that , do n't you ?
BEN: Answer ! God damn it Answer the phone Once again he gets the voicemail .
ANNA: From now on , I 'm going to close my eyes .
BEN: Come on , let 's go .
ANNA: Mr. Carson , no matter what happens in there , I want you to do as I say and make sure I never get out of this place .
AMY: Michael ?
DAISY: Tiger ! Come here kitty , come here
BEN: Watch your step , a water pipe has urst , the whole basement is flooded .
ANNA: You stay outside
AMY: Michael ?
DAISY: It is over , Mom ?
AMY: Yes sweetheart , it 's over
PAUL: Still got it .
PAUL: An old friend . I was rummaging through a closet and it was just sitting there . Like it was waiting for me .
SINDELL: It 's it 's nice , Paul . It 's got character .
PAUL: When I wrote my first book , I used to carry it around in this while I was looking for a publisher . That was a good book , Marcia . I was a writer then .
SINDELL: You 're still a writer .
PAUL: I have n't been a writer since I got into the Misery business
SINDELL: Not a bad business . This thing would still be growing , too . The first printing order on Misery 's Child was the most everover a million .
PAUL: Marcia , please .
SINDELL: No , no . Misery Chastain put braces on your daughter 's teeth and is putting her through college , bought you two houses and floor seats to the Knick games and what thanks does she get ? You go and kill her .
PAUL: Marcia , you know I started `` Misery '' on a lark . Do I look like a guy who writes romance novels ? Do I sound like Danielle Steel ? It was a one- time shot and we got lucky . I neve meant it to become my life . And if I had n't gotten rid of her now , I 'd have ended up writing her forever . For the first time in fifteen years , I think I 'm really onto something here .
SINDELL: I 'm glad to hear that , Paul , I really am . But you have to knowwhen you fans find out that you killed off their favorite heroine , they 're not going to say , `` Ooh , good , Paul Sheldon can finally write what we 've always wanted An esoteric , semi- autobiographical character study .
PAUL: Marcia , why are you doing this to me ? Do n't you know I 'm scared enough ? Do n't you think I remember how nobody gave a shit about my first books ? You think I 'm dying to go back to shouting in the wilderness ? I 'm doing this because I have to . Now , I 'm leaving for Colorado to try to finish this and I want your good thoughtsbecause if I can make it work I might just have something that I want on my tombstone . On the word `` tombstone ''
ANNIE: You hear meBreathe ! I said eathe ! ! !
PAUL: where am I ? ANNIE is quickly by his side .
ANNIE: Shhh we 're just outside Silve Creek .
PAUL: How long ?
ANNIE: You 've been here two days . You 're gon na be okay . My name is Annie Wilkes and I 'm
PAUL: my number one fan . And now the gibberish words make sense .
ANNIE: That 's right . I 'm also a nurse . Here . Take these .
PAUL: What are they ?
ANNIE: They 're called Novrilthey 're fo your pain . ANNIE applies a cool rag to his forehead .
PAUL: Should n't I be in a hospital ?
ANNIE: The blizzard was too strong . I could n't risk trying to get you there . I tried calling , but the phone lines are down . PAUL tries to test his left arm .
ANNIE: Your legs just sing grand opera when you move , do n't they ? It 's not going to hurt forever , Paul , I promise you .
PAUL: Will I be able to walk ?
ANNIE: Of course you will . And your arm will be fine , too . Your shoulder was dislocated pretty badly , but I finally popped it back in there . But what I 'm most proud of is the work I did on those legs . Considering what I had around the house , I do n't think there 's a doctor who could have done any better .
SINDELL: This is Marcia Sindell calling from New York City . I 'd like to speak to the Silver Creek Chief of Police o the Sheriff .
BUSTER: I 'm pretty sure they 're both not usy , Ms. Sindell , since they 're oth me . I also happen to be President of the Policeman 's Benefit Association , Chairman of the Patrolman 's Retirement Fund , and if you need a good fishing guide , you could do a lot worse ; call me Buster , everybody does , what can I do fo you ?
SINDELL: I 'm a literary agent , and I feel like a fool calling you , but I think one of my clients , Paul Sheldon , might be in some kind of trouble .
BUSTER: Paul Sheldon ? You mean Paul Sheldon the writer ?
SINDELL: Yes .
BUSTER: He 's your client , huh ?
SINDELL: Yes , he is .
BUSTER: People sure like those Misery books .
SINDELL: I 'm sure you know Paul 's been going to the Silver Creek Lodge for years to finish his books .
BUSTER: Yeah , I understand he 's been up here the last six weeks .
SINDELL: Not quite . I just called , and they said he checked out five days ago . Is n't that a little strange ?
BUSTER: I do n't know . Does he always phone you when he checks out of hotels ?
SINDELL: No , no , of course not . It 's just that his daughter has n't heard from him , and when he 's got a book coming out , he usually keeps in touch . So when there was no word from him
BUSTER: You think he might be missing ?
SINDELL: I hate that I made this calltell me I 'm being silly .
BUSTER: Just a little over-protective , maybe . Tell you whatnothing 's been reported out here but I 'll put his name through ou system . And if anything turns up , I 'll call you right away .
SINDELL: I appreciate that . Thanks a lot .
VIRGINIA: We actually got a phone call . Busy morning .
BUSTER: Work , work , work . Virginia ? When was that blizzard ?
VIRGINIA: Four or five days ago . Why ?
BUSTER: no reason HOLD ON BUSTER for a moment .
PAUL'S VOICE: I guess it was kind of a miracle you finding me
ANNIE: No , it was n't a miracle at all in a way , I was following you .
PAUL: Following me ?
ANNIE: Well , it was n't any secret to me that you were staying at the Silve Creek , seeing as how I 'm your number- one fan and all . Some nights I 'd just tool on down there , sit outside and look up at the light in you cabin and I 'd try to imagine what was going on in the room of the world 's greatest writer .
PAUL: Say that last part again , I did n't quite hear
ANNIE: Do n't move nowwould n't want to hurt this neck Well , the other afternoon I was on my way home , and there you were , leaving the Lodge , and I wondered why a literary genius would go for a drive when there was a big storm coming .
PAUL: I did n't know it was going to be a ig storm .
ANNIE: Lucky for you , I did . Lucky for me too . Because now you 're alive and you can write more books . Oh , Paul , I 've read everything of Yours , but the Misery novels
PAUL: You 're very kind
ANNIE: And you 're very brilliant , and you must be a good man , or you could never have created such a wondrous , loving creature as Misery Chastain . Like a baby . All done . ANNIE starts cleaning up .
PAUL: When do you think the phone lines 'll e back up ? I have to call my daughter , and I should call New York and let my agent know I 'm breathing .
ANNIE: It should n't be too much longer . Once the roads are open , the lines 'll e up in no time . If you give me their numbers , I 'll keep trying them for you . Could I ask you a favor ? I noticed in your case there was a new Paul Sheldon book and and I wondered if maybe
PAUL: You want to read it ?
ANNIE: If you would n't mind .
PAUL: I have a hard and fast rule about who can read my stuff at this early stageonly my editor , my agent , and anyone who saves me from freezing to death in a car wreck .
ANNIE: You 'll never realize what a rare treat you 've given me .
PAUL: I do n't have a title yet .
ANNIE: What 's it about ?
PAUL: It 's crazy , but I do n't really know , I mean I have n't written anything ut `` Misery '' for so long thatyou ead it you can tell me what you think it 's about . Maybe you can come up with a title .
ANNIE: Oh , like I could do that ?
LIBBY: Nothing unusual about Mr. Sheldon 's leaving , Busteryou can tell by the champagne .
BUSTER: Maybe you can , Libby .
LIBBY: No , see , he always ordered a bottle of Dom Perignon when he was ready to go . Then he 'd pay up and be out the door .
BUSTER: No long-distance phone calls , Federal Express packagesanything at all out of the ordinary ?
LIBBY: I do n't think Mr. Sheldon likes fo things to be out of the ordinary . Considering who he is and all , famous and all , he does n't have airs . Drives the same car out from New York each time'65 Mustangsaid it helps him think . He was always a good guest , never made a noise , never bothered a soul . Sure hope nothing happened to him .
BUSTER: So do I
LIBBY: I 'll bet that old Mustang 's pulling into New York right now .
BUSTER: I 'm sure you 're right . But you can tell he 's not sure at all as we
ANNIE: I know I 'm only forty pages into your book , but She stops , fills the spoon up again .
PAUL: But what ?
ANNIE: Nothing .
PAUL: No , what is it ?
ANNIE: Oh , it 's ridiculous , who am I to make a criticism to someone like you ?
PAUL: I can take it , go ahead .
ANNIE: Well , it 's brilliantly written , but then everything you write is illiant .
PAUL: Pretty rough so far .
ANNIE: The swearing , Paul . There , I said it .
PAUL: The profanity bothers you ?
ANNIE: It has no nobility .
PAUL: Well , these are slum kids , I was a slum kid , everybody talks like that .
ANNIE: They do not . What do you think I say when I go to the feed store in town ? `` Now , Wally , give me a bag of that effing pigfeed and ten pounds of that bitchly cow-corn '' PAUL is amused by this .
VIRGINIA: This sure is fun . She puts her hand on his leg .
BUSTER: Virginia , when you 're in this car , you 're not my wife , you 're my deputy .
VIRGINIA: Well , this deputy would rather be home under the covers with the Sheriff .
BUSTER: Stopstop right here .
VIRGINIA: What ? What is it ?
BUSTER: Look at that broken branch there
VIRGINIA: Could be the weight of the snow .
BUSTER: Could beor a rotten branch or a mountain lion could have landed on it . Could be a lot of things . He steps off the road , starts down .
VIRGINIA: Anything down there ?
BUSTER: Hope notif he is , he 's dead . Let 's go to the newspaper office . As they get in the car
ANNIE: Oh , I 'm sorry . I did n't mean to wake you .
PAUL: It 's fine .
ANNIE: They had it at the store , Paul , there was a whole batch of them there . As soon as I saw it , I slammed my money down . I got the first copy .
PAUL: Then the roads are open
ANNIE: The one to town is , but that 's about it . I called the hospital and talked to the head orthopedic surgeon . I told him who you were and what had happened . He said as long as there 's no infection , you 're not in any danger , and as soon as the road to the hospital is open , they 'll send an ambulance for you .
PAUL: The phones are working ?
ANNIE: Well , mine 's still out . But the ones in town were working just fine . I called that agent of yours . Oh , Paul , I peeked at the very eginning . What a wonderful first pagejust to ead the name Misery Chastain
PAUL: My daughter must be going nuts .
ANNIE: it 's like a visit from my oldest , dearest friend .
PAUL: I was supposed to be home for he irthday three days ago .
ANNIE: Your agent said she would tell he you were okay . But I 'm afraid you 'll have to wait until tomorrow if you want to speak to her yourself . She starts to leave , stops at the door .
PAUL: I guess that means it 's okay .
ANNIE: No . No , it is n't , it 's oh pooh , I ca n't think of any words . Would `` great '' be insulting ?
PAUL: I can live with `` great . '' He starts , with effort , to eat .
ANNIE: No , it 's not just great , it 's perfect , a perfect , perfect thing .
PAUL: Well , you ca n't believe everything you read in magazines .
ANNIE: I knew it . I knew it was n't true . Boy , how do they get away with printing stuff like that ?
PAUL: You 'd be amazed at what some people will believe .
ANNIE: Thank you so much .
PAUL: My pleasure .
ANNIE: I thought it was time you two should meet . Paul , say hello to my favorite east in all the world , my sow , Misery .
PAUL: Misery ?
ANNIE: Yes . I told you I was your number- one fan .
PAUL: I 'm getting to believe you .
ANNIE: This farm was getting kind of dreary , what with just the few cows and chickens and me But when I got Misery here , everything Changedshe just makes me smile so .
PAUL: She 's a fine uh pig is what she is
ANNIE: I 'm on page three-hundred now , Paul , and it 's better than perfectit 's divine . What 's the ceiling that dago painted ?
PAUL: The Sistine Chapel ?
ANNIE: Yeah , that and Misery 's Childthose are the only two divine things eve in this world
PAUL: I know how that can be .
ANNIE: I do n't know about you , but what I did to get through it was I dove into workdays , nightsnight shifts can be lonely at a hospital . I did a lot of reading . That was hen I first discovered Misery . She made me so happy . She made me forget all my problems . 'Course , I suppose you had a little something to do with that too . There is a peeing sound .
PAUL: Yeah , well He is embarrassed .
ANNIE: I just kept reading them over and over . I know when I finish this one and I 've only got two chapters to go I 'll just turn right to the front page and start reading it again .
PAUL: I 'm
ANNIE: Done ?
PAUL: Yeah , thanks .
ANNIE: No problem . As she takes the bedpan
PAUL: Well , it 's not something you should enter into lightly .
ANNIE: It boils down to respect . People just do n't respect the institution of marriage any more . They have no sense of real commitment .
PAUL: Well , I hope you like it .
ANNIE: Of course I 'll like it . Misery 's about to have her child . What 's it gon na be , a boy or a girl ? Ooh , do n't tell me . With that , she exits .
PAUL: Annie , in 1871 , women often died in childbirth , but her spirit is the important thing , and Misery 's spirit is still alive
ANNIE: I DO N'T WANT HER SPIRIT ! I want HER ! And you MURDERED her !
PAUL: I DID N'T
ANNIE: Then who did ?
PAUL: No oneshe just diedshe slipped away , that 's all .
ANNIE: She slipped away ? She slipped away ? She did n't just slip away . You did it . You did it . You did it . You did it . You murdered my Misery .
BUSTER: No , Ms. Sindell , there 's no point in coming up here now . Everything that can be done is Yes , we 're working closely with the state police , and the FBI has been informed . Right Right As soon as we know anything we 'll let you know . No , it 's no other . Call anytime . Bye , Ms. Sindell . VIRGINIA enters , carrying some files .
VIRGINIA: Here 's the list of all Sheldon 's credit charges . Nothing after the Silver Creek . Any calls ?
BUSTER: Just from his agent .
ANNIE: What are you doing on the floor ? It 's my fault . If I 'd had a prope hospital bed , this never would have happened . Here , let me help you back in . I know this hurts , but it 'll only take a few seconds . There you go . Comfy ?
PAUL: Perfect .
ANNIE: You 're such a kidder . I have a big surprise for you . But first there 's something you must do .
PAUL: I do n't suppose I could have a little snack while I wait for the surprise ?
ANNIE: I 'll get you everything you want , ut you must listen first . Sometimes my thinking is a little muddy , I accept that . It 's why I could n't emember all those things they were asking me on the witness stand in Denver .
PAUL: Show me the way ?
ANNIE: Yes .
PAUL: When I mentioned a snack , I was thinking more along the lines of a cheese and crackers kind of thing .
ANNIE: Paul , this is no time for jokes . You must rid the world of this filth . She hands him the box of kitchen matches .
PAUL: You want me to burn my book ?
ANNIE: Yes .
PAUL: You want me to burn my book ?
ANNIE: I know this may be difficult fo you , but it 's for the best .
PAUL: This is n't difficult , my agent 's made dozens of copies . There 's gon na e an auction on this , and every publishing house in New York is eading it now . So if you want me to urn it , fine . You 're not ridding the world of anything .
ANNIE: Then light the match , Paul .
PAUL: No big deal .
ANNIE: So you 've indicated . Do it .
PAUL: You know , Annie , this book neve would have survived without you . When it gets to new York , there will e a big auction , and whatever it ings we can split . God knows you 're entitled to it .
ANNIE: Oh , Paul . This is n't about money . It 's about decency and purity . It 's about God 's values .
PAUL: You 're right . You 're right . I do n't know what I was thinking . I 'll tell you what . It does n't have to be published . Nobody ever has to see it . I 'll just keep it for myself . No one will ever have to know it exists .
ANNIE: As long as it does exist , your mind wo n't ever be free . I think you should light the match , Paul . There is a long silence . PAUL does n't move .
BUSTER: That 's the Steadman place up there . The only other place up here is the Wilkes farm .
ANNIE: I do believe the winters are getting shorter and shorter every year . People say it has something to do with the ozone layer . What do you think ?
PAUL: I do n't know .
ANNIE: Yeah , well , it 's a theory . Here 's your Novril . How does tuna casserole sound fo dinner ?
PAUL: Great .
ANNIE: See , is n't this nice ?
PAUL: Great . I 've always wanted to visit the other side of the room .
ANNIE: And look what I 've got for you . An electric razor so you can shave yourself now .
PAUL: If I knew this was gon na be the surprise , you could 've gotten me to urn all my books .
ANNIE: Now do n't josh . This is a very big day for you , Paul . Here . You just sit tight , and I 'll set everything up . ANNIE exits .
PAUL: Set what up ?
ANNIE: That 's the big surprise . Your new studioafter all , writers do need a place to work .
PAUL: Work ? You mean write ? What in the world do you think I 'd write ?
ANNIE: Oh , but Paul ! I do n't think , I know ! Now that you 've gotten rid of that nasty manuscript , you can go back to doing what you 're great at you 're going to write a new novel your greatest achievement ever Misery 's Return .
PAUL: Misery 's Return ?
ANNIE: I know you did n't mean it when you killed her , and now you 'll make it ight .
ANNIE: I expect nothing less than you masterpiece .
PAUL: You do understand that this is n't the ordinary way books get written I mean , some people might actually consider this an oddball situation .
ANNIE: I have total confidence in you illiancebesides , the view will inspire you .
PAUL: I guess you do n't get bothered by neighbors much .
ANNIE: Do n't worry about that . You 'll have total solitude so you can concentrate on your work .
PAUL: Great .
ANNIE: I got you this expensive paper to type on .
PAUL: It 's two of the letters in my favorite nurse 's name , Annie .
ANNIE: Youfooler ! Did I do good ?
PAUL: You did great , except there 's just one little thingI ca n't work with this paper . It 's Corrasable Bond , it smudges . Maybe you could go back into town and bring me some white , long-grained mimeo .
ANNIE: But mine cost the most so I do n't see how it could smudge .
PAUL: C'mere , I 'll show you .
ANNIE: Well , it does smudge after allis n't that fascinating ?
PAUL: I thought you 'd be interested . I 'd like you to be in on everything , Annie . Not just the finished book , ut how it 's written .
ANNIE: Thank you for thinking of me . Anything else I can get while I 'm in town ? Any other crucial requirements that need satisfying ? Would you like a tiny tape recorder ? Or maybe a handmade set of writing slippers ?
PAUL: No , just the paper will be fine .
ANNIE: Are you sure ? 'Cause if you want , I 'll bring back the whole store fo you .
PAUL: Annie , what 's the matter ?
ANNIE: What 's the matter ? I 'll tell you what 's the matter . I go out of my way for you . I do everything to try and make you happy . I feed you , I clean you , I dress you . And what thanks do I get ? `` You bought the wrong paper , Annie . I ca n't write on this paper , Annie . '' Well , I 'll get your stupid paper , but you just bette start showing me a little more appreciation around here , Miste Man .
PAUL: Shit
PAUL: Operator
ANNIE: Just the kind you asked for . And as the door opens
PAUL: You know goddamn well what I 've been doingI 'VE BEEN SITTING HERE SUFFERING . I need my pills .
ANNIE: Poor dear Let 's get you back in ed and I 'll get them for you .
PAUL: I want my pills NOW !
ANNIE: It 'll only take a second .
PAUL: I want my pain to go 'way , Annie make it go 'way , please Annie please
ANNIE: It just breaks my heart to see you like this
PAUL: Well , I do n't hold grudges . Afte all , who does n't let off a little steam once in a while .
ANNIE: My genius needs his rest before he writes . She hands him a pad and pencil .
PAUL: Yeah , well I would n't expect too much .
ANNIE: Do n't be silly . You 'll be brilliant . Think of me as your inspiration .
BUSTER: Walter , we could be skipping lunch today .
VIRGINIA: You do n't think he 's dead , do you ?
BUSTER: He might well be . But not the way they say . He did n't crawl out of that car by himself . You saw those dents on the doorsomeone pulled him out .
VIRGINIA: It was an old carthose dents could have been there forever .
BUSTER: There 's two kinds of people that drive around in old cars the ones that ca n't afford new ones , and the ones who would n't give 'em up fo anything in the world . That second unch do n't drive around with twenty- five-year-old dents . As they drive off
ANNIE: Do n't be nervous just remember , I 'll treasure whatever you do . Now , as she turns again , moves quickly away
ANNIE: I 'm sorry , Paul . This is all wrong , you 'll have to do it over again .
PAUL: What ? What happened to `` I 'll treasure whatever you do ? ''
ANNIE: Paul , it 's not worthy of you . Throw it all out except for the part of naming that gravedigger after me . You can leave that in .
PAUL: I really value your criticism , but maybe you 're being a little hasty here .
ANNIE: Paul , what you 've written just is n't fair .
PAUL: not fair ?
ANNIE: That 's rightwhen I was growing up in Bakersfield , my favorite thing in all the world was to go to the movies on Saturday afternoons for the chapte plays
PAUL: cliff-hangers
ANNIE: I know that , Mister Manthey also call them serials . I 'm not stupid , you know . Anyway , my favorite was Rocket Man , and once it was a no-brakes chapter , the bad guys stuck him in a car on a mountain road and knocked him out and welded the doors shut and tore out the brakes and started him to his death and he woke up and tried to steer and tried to get out , but the car went off a cliff before he could escape and it crashed and burned andI was so upset and excited and the next week you better believe I was first in line and they always start with the end of the last week and there was Rocket Man trying to get out , and here came the cliff and JUST BEFORE the car went off he jumped free and all the kids cheered but I did n't cheer , I stood right up and started shouting , `` This is n't what happened last weekhave you all got amnesia ? THEY JUST CHEATED
PAUL: They always cheated like that in cliff chapter plays .
ANNIE: But not you . Not with my Misery . Remember , Ian did ride for Dr. Cleary at the end of the last book , but his horse fell jumping that fence and Ian broke his shoulder and his ribs and lay there all night in the ditch so he never reached the doctor , so there could n't have been any `` experimental blood transfusion '' that saved her life . Misery was buried in the ground at the end , Paul , so you 'll have to start there . As she goes
PAUL: Look at this , I 've got Lizzie Borden for an editor , here .
ANNIE: What 's the matter , Paul ? You have n't written a word .
PAUL: I ca n't write this anymore .
ANNIE: Do n't be silly . Of course you can .
PAUL: I 'm telling you , I ca n't .
ANNIE: You canyou have the `` got ta ''
PAUL: The what ?
ANNIE: The `` got ta . '' Remember , you talked about it in Playboy magazine . You said there 's a million things you ca n't do in this world ; you ca n't hit a curve ball , you ca n't fix a leaky faucet or make a marriage work ut there 's one thing you always have , and that 's the power of the `` got ta . ''
PAUL: I said that ?
ANNIE: You said you can make it so they got ta turn the page . You know , `` I ' got ta ' know will she live , '' `` I ' got ta ' know will he catch the killer . '' `` I got ta see how this chapte ends . '' You said it . I do n't usually uy that magazine . I only got it , 'cause they were interviewing you .
PAUL: What about a bee ?
ANNIE: What ?
PAUL: Nothing .
ANNIE: You better . Oh , Paul , when Ian ealized that the reason they 'd buried Misery alive was because the bee sting had put her in that temporary coma
PAUL: Yeah , yeah
ANNIE: Oh , Paul , can I read each chapte when you finish ? I can fill in the `` n '' s. Will she be her old self , now that Ian has dug her out , or will she have amnesia ?
PAUL: have to wait .
ANNIE: Will she still love him with that special perfect love ?
PAUL: Have to wait .
ANNIE: Not even a hint ? Paul shakes his head .
PAUL: Whenever he played Radio City , who do you think was right there in the front row ?
ANNIE: I 'm going to play my records all day
LONG: to inspire youhe 's my all-time favorite . And with that , she starts to leave .
PAUL: Annie ? She stops at the door .
ANNIE: Oh , Paul . It would be an honor .
PAUL: Jesus Christ .
VIRGINIA: No , he 's not here . I do n't know where he went . He never tells me anything anymore . He 's probably out having an affair somewhere . Wait a minute . I think I hear him coming . BUSTER enters carrying a bagful of books .
BUSTER: Hey , Jim , what 's doing ? Uh-huh uh- huh Jim , we 've been over this . If you 're gon na have benches in front of your store , people are gon na sit on them . I do n't like him either , ut I 'm not going to come over there and tell him to move . Give my best to Denise . Bye .
VIRGINIA: Well , whoever she is , she sure likes to read a lot .
BUSTER: Virginia , I 'm flattered you think I got that much energy . I just figured if I ca n't find Paul Sheldon , at least I can find out what he wrote about .
VIRGINIA: What do you expect to find ? A story about a guy who drove his car off a cliff in a snowstorm ?
BUSTER: Now , you see , it 's that kind of sarcasm that 's given our marriage eal spice .
ANNIE: I hope you like it .
PAUL: It looks wonderful . And so do you .
ANNIE: Oh They eat in awkward silence . Finally
PAUL: I 've never had meatloaf this good , what do you do to it ?
ANNIE: My secret is I only use fresh tomatoes , never canned . And to give it that little extra zip , I mix in some Spam with the ground beef .
PAUL: Oh . You ca n't get this in a restaurant in New York . After another pause
ANNIE: A toast ?
PAUL: Yes , to Misery . Let me pour you some more wine .
ANNIE: To Misery .
PAUL: Wait , let 's do this right . Do you have any candles ?
ANNIE: Oh , I do n't know . I think so . I 'll go look .
PAUL: Did you study decorating , or do you just have a flair ?
ANNIE: Oh , you . I just picked things up over the years .
PAUL: Well , it certainly says you .
ANNIE: You really think so ?
PAUL: Absolutely . Listen , if you ca n't find any , it 's okay . I just thought it might be nice . ANNIE re-enters with a candle .
ANNIE: Are you kidding ? If anyone ever told me that one day I 'd be having a candlelit dinner with Paul Sheldon in my own house , I woulda checked oth legs to see which one was being pulled . Will this do ?
PAUL: It 's perfect .
ANNIE: Oh , Paul , every time I think about it , I get goosebumps . They clink glasses .
PAUL: To Misery . So they drink their wine .
ANNIE: Paul , this is positively the best Misery you 've ever written .
PAUL: I think you 're right .
ANNIE: I think it 's so wonderful that Misery would sacrifice her title to take up the cause of her people . That 's true nobility . Paul hands her some new pages . As she exits ,
ANNIE: Here 's your pills . She drops them on the table .
PAUL: Annie , what is it ?
PAUL: Why would you lose me ?
ANNIE: The book is almost finished . You legs are getting better . Soon you 'll e able to walk . You 'll be wanting to leave .
PAUL: Why would I want to leave ? I like it here .
ANNIE: That 's very kind of you , but I 'll et it 's not altogether true .
PAUL: It is .
ANNIE: I have this gun , and sometimes I think about using it . She is absentmindedly clicking the empty gun .
BUSTER: `` There is a justice higher than that of man . I will be judged by Him . ''
VIRGINIA: What ?
BUSTER: They 're hauling Misery into court .
VIRGINIA: That 's nice .
BUSTER: `` There is a justice higher than that of manI will be judged by Him . ''
PAUL: Holy shit . Then a headline which reads
ANNIE: Paul , I know you 've been out .
PAUL: What ?
ANNIE: You 've been out of your room .
PAUL: No , I have n't .
ANNIE: Paul , my little ceramic penguin in the study always faces due south .
PAUL: I do n't know what you 're talking about .
ANNIE: Is this what you 're looking for ? I know you 've been out twice , Paul . At first , I could n't figure out how you did it , but last night I found you key . I know I left my scrapbook out , and I can imagine what you might be thinking of me . But you see , Paul , it 's all okay .
PAUL: Annie , whatever you 're thinking about , do n't do it .
ANNIE: Now do n't fuss , Paul .
PAUL: Why would I run away ? I 'm a writer , Annieit 's all I amand I 've neve written this welleven you said that this is my best , did n't you ? ANNIE picks up a sledgehammer .
ANNIE: Shh , darling , trust me It 's for the best . She takes the sledgehammer back .
PAUL: Annie , for God 's sake , please .
ANNIE: Almost done , just one more .
BUSTER: Just leave it , all right ?
VIRGINIA: Oh , I like that tone .
BUSTER: How many times do I have to tell you I have a system here . Where the hell is that thing ?
VIRGINIA: What thing ?
BUSTER: That thing . Here it is . Right where it 's supposed to be .
VIRGINIA: What is it ?
BUSTER: I 'm not sure . Maybe nothing .
VIRGINIA: It 's good you found it .
BUSTER: There 's that spice again .
BUSTER: Interesting . HOLD ON HIS FACE , then
ANNIE: Hi , Punkin .
BUSTER: Hey , Pete .
PETE: Buster .
BUSTER: Answer me a couple things ?
PETE: If I can .
BUSTER: Do you have any of those new Paul Sheldon books ?
PETE: We had a batch . Sold 'em all in three days .
BUSTER: You would n't happen to remember if Miz Wilkes bought one , would you ?
PETE: Are you kidding ? Every time that fella writes a book , she makes me set aside the first copy .
BUSTER: Has she been buying any odd things lately ?
PETE: Miz Wilkes ? Same old stuff . Lest you call paper odd .
BUSTER: Newspapers ?
PETE: No , the typing kind .
BUSTER: Oh . That kind . Nothing odd about that . He can not hide his excitement now as we
ANNIE: Paul , do n't you think it 's time fo you to start writing again ? It 's een over a week .
PAUL: I do n't know , it 's weird , but a couple of broken bones has n't done a lot for my creative juices . Get the fuck out of here .
ANNIE: Do n't talk to me like that .
PAUL: Why , what are you going to do ? Kill me ? Take your best shot .
ANNIE: Why are you so mean , Mister you'd-be- dead-in-the-snow-if-it-wasn't-for- me ?
PAUL: Oh , no reason , you keep me prisoner , you make me burn my book , you drive a sledgehammer into my ankles
ANNIE: I 'll drive a sledgehammer into you man-gland if you 're not nicer
PAUL: Be my guest .
ANNIE: That 's disgusting . As she exits .
ANNIE: I do n't think I 'll ever understand you . I cook your meals , I tend to you practically twenty-four hours a day , and you continue to fight me . When are we going to develop a sense of trust ?
BUSTER: Sorry , did n't mean to startle you . You did n't give me a chance to knock .
ANNIE: Guess you can tell from my reaction , I 'm not all that used to visitors out here . What can I do for you ?
BUSTER: I was just wondering if you happen to know anything about Paul Sheldon .
ANNIE: What do you want to know ?
BUSTER: Anything you can tell me might help .
ANNIE: Well , he was born in Worcester , Massachusetts , forty-two years ago , the only child of Franklin and Helene Sheldon , mediocre student , majored in history
BUSTER: Excuse me , that 's not exactly the kind of information I was after . You see , he 's been missing for quite some time now , and
ANNIE: I know . It 's so upsetting . I 'm his number-one fanI 've got all his ooks , every sentence he ever put down . I 'm so proud of my Paul Sheldon collection here I am , prattling on and my manners have just flown away . I have n't invited you in . Please .
BUSTER: Thank you .
ANNIE: 'Course you must know about that horrible accident .
BUSTER: Get ready for what ?
ANNIE: To try and be his replacementhe gave so much pleasure to so many people and there 's a shortage of pleasure on this planet these days , in case you had n't noticed . BUSTER enters Paul 's room . ANNIE follows .
BUSTER: Sure .
ANNIE: It 's right this way .
BUSTER: Well maybe it takes time to get the hang of it .
ANNIE: I could give you a couple of hundred pages of mine , and you could tell me what you think .
BUSTER: I 'm not much of a critic .
ANNIE: Well , I just thoughtoh , look at me . You 'd think I 'd never had a house guest before . Would you like something to drink ?
BUSTER: Sure .
ANNIE: How does a nice cup of cocoa sound ?
BUSTER: Sounds good . As she exits into the kitchen .
ANNIE: There 's some already made .
BUSTER: Must get lonely , living out here all y yourself .
ANNIE: I always say if you ca n't enjoy you own company , you 're not fit company for anyone else .
BUSTER: You got a point there As Buster moves up the stairs
ANNIE: Here you are . BUSTER heads down the stairs , ANNIE follows .
BUSTER: Thanks , Miz Wilkes , but I do n't want to take up any more of your time . I est be going .
ANNIE: But you did n't even taste your cocoa . They cross to the front door .
BUSTER: I 'm sure it 's wonderful , but really should be getting back . BUSTER opens the door .
ANNIE: I 'd be delighted . Now that you know the way
BUSTER: Miz Wilkes , are you all right ?
PAUL: Here . I 'm down here . Down here .
BUSTER: Mr. Sheldon ?
ANNIE: Do n't feel bad , Paul . It had to happen . I 've been waiting for this sign .
PAUL: I know you do . I love you too , Annie . And you 're right . We are meant to be together . And I know we must die . But it must be so that Misery can live . We have the power to give Misery eternal life . We must finish the ook .
ANNIE: But the time is now . Soon others will come .
PAUL: It 's almost done . By dawn we 'll be able to give Misery back to the world .
ANNIE: Here , Paul . I 'll fix you something to eat .
PAUL: Three more chapters to go . She looks at him now , enthralled .
ANNIE: The stranger staying at the Inn , is he someone from Misery 's past ?
PAUL: Maybe .
ANNIE: This is so exciting . It 's Windthorne , her first love , right ?
PAUL: Maybe . Are you ready for the next chapter ? He taunts her with it .
ANNIE: Oh you ! She takes the pages and goes .
PAUL: I 'm glad you like it .
ANNIE: Paul , this will be our legacy .
PAUL: It will .
ANNIE: Oh , Paul . I 'm dying . Does she wind up with Ian or Windthorne ? You have to tell me .
PAUL: You 'll know very soon . I 'm starting the last chapter . And when I finish , I want everything to be perfect . I 'll require three things .
ANNIE: What things ?
PAUL: You do n't know ?
ANNIE: I was fooling , silly . You need a cigarette , because you used to smoke but you quit except when you finish a book , and you just have one , and the match is to light it . And you need one glass of champagne . Dome Pear-igg-non .
PAUL: Dome Pear-igg-non it is . AS ANNIE exits .
PAUL: Annie ! Annie ! With that , she enters .
ANNIE: Yes , Paul .
PAUL: I 'm almost done .
ANNIE: Oh , Paul , this is so romantic . Ian and Windthorne dueling for the right to Misery 's hand . Does Ian win ? Oh , do n't me . It 's Windthorne , right ?
PAUL: You 'll know everything in a minute . Get the champagne .
ANNIE: Ahh ! ! !
ANNIE: Did I do good ?
PAUL: You did perfect . Except for one thing . This time we need two glasses . He takes the last page out of the typewriter .
ANNIE: Oh , Paul .
PAUL: It 's all right here , Annie . Remembe how for all those years no one eve knew who Misery 's real father was , or if they 'd ever be reunited ? It 's all right here . Will Misery finally lead her countrymen to freedom ? Does she finally marry Ian or will it be Windthorne ? It 's all right here .
ANNIE: Paul , you ca n't . And as her hands fly out beseechingly
PAUL: Why not ? I learned it from you And on that
ANNIE: No , no , NOT MISERYNOT MY MISERY !
PAUL: Here . Here . You want it ? You want it ? You can eat iteat iteat it till you fucking CHOKEyou sick , twisted fuck . And as he forces more paper into her mouth
YOUNGER COP: It 's the writerthe dead one
PAUL: right ! I 'm the dead one
OLDER COP: Where 's Sheriff McCain ?
PAUL: He 's in the cellar . She killed him .
OLDER COP: Annie Wilkes ?
PAUL: Yeah . She 's in there .
OLDER COP: Mr. Sheldon ? There 's no one in there .
PAUL: Sorry I 'm late . Jenny 's basketball game went into overtime . If anybody ever told me I 'd have a daughte who 'd get a triple double , I 'd
SINDELL: Did they win ?
PAUL: Yeah . They 're in the semis .
SINDELL: Here it is . Very first copy .
PAUL: That 'd be a first .
SINDELL: And my contacts at Time and Newsweek tell me they 're both raves . And do n't laughfor the first time , I think you 've got a shot at some prizes .
PAUL: Great .
SINDELL: I thought you 'd be thrilled . You 're eing taken seriously .
PAUL: I 'm delighted the critics are liking it , and I hope the people like it , too . But it 's not why I wrote the ook .
SINDELL: Paul , since you brought her up , I have to ask you this , or I 'd be drummed out of the agents ' union what about a non-fiction book ? The truth about what went on in that house .
PAUL: Gee , Marcia , if I did n't know you etter , I 'd think you were suggesting I dredge up the worst horror of my life just so we could make a few ucks .
SINDELL: Now you 've hurt me , Paul . As Paul glances around
PAUL: I am . Well , maybe not completely He glances toward the trolley .
WAITRESS: Would you care for anything ?
PAUL: Cut me something sinful
ANATOLY: Kasimov , Kasimov , good that you called us .
KASIMOV: I do n't remember what happened ! We were at the bar , drinking , laughing having fun .
ANATOLY: Kasimov . Do n't flounder .
JACK: Jesus , she 's been under too long . Come on , come on !
KASIMOV: You 're the only one who can help me .
ANATOLY: C'mon , c'mon , tell the truthc'mon .
KASIMOV: They 'll kill me . ANATOLY paces up the room , away from KASIMOV .

ETHAN: We got it . On your feet .
CLAIRE: I want to sleep . Can I sleep here .
ETHAN: Walk , just walk . Start walking .
CLAIRE: I 'm walking .
ETHAN: Talking 's good , walking 's better .
CLAIRE: Sleeping 's better .
ETHAN: If you 're gon na do this again Claire , It 's not gon na be on my watch .
CLAIRE: Oh yeah ?
JACK: Claire .
ETHAN: Jack .
JACK: Just waiting for you , tubs .
FLIGHT ATTENDANT: Would you like to watch a movie Mr Rosen ?
PHELPS: No , I prefer the theatre .
FLIGHT ATTENDANT: Would you consider the cinema of the Ukraine ?
PHELPS: Perhaps you 'd choose one for me .
KITTRIDGE: Good morning , Mr. Phelps . The man you 're about to see is Aleksander Golitsyn
JACK: Look to your right , then back to me . There 's a camera built right into the idge . Whatever you see it sees and transmits it back here . Can you hear me ?
SARAH: Of course I can hear you .
JACK: No , in yourear piece . You have a lovely smile . Can you hear me now ?
SARAH: Loud and clear .
JACK: What 's going on ?
SARAH: I do n't know .
JACK: Why do n't you take a look ?
SARAH: Jackthat 's spying .
JACK: That 's what we do is n't it ?
SARAH: Jack you 're so wicked .
JACK: Too wicked to have a drink later ?
SARAH: I think I might just take that look .
ETHAN: Yeah , well , Jim , fact is I 've got more than ninety days leave coming .
PHELPS: A hundred and sixty-seven , I think it is .
ETHAN: I thought I 'd take some now .
PHELPS: What the hell 's made you decide to take your leave at the worst possible time ? Claire 's in a weird mood too .
ETHAN: Oh ? What 's the problem ?
PHELPS: I do n't know , I had to go to Chicago again . You were in Kiev . You tell me .
ETHAN: Tell you what ?
PHELPS: When you started noticing your short term memory loss . What the problem was you and Claire had in Kiev ?
ETHAN: What problem ?
PHELPS: Ah , God , forget it . What are we talking urnout here ?
ETHAN: I guess .
PHELPS: Ethan , you ca n't burn out .
ETHAN: Why not ?
PHELPS: Because I ca n't afford it . And because you 'd burn up before you 'd burn out .
ETHAN: How was Chicago ?
PHELPS: Wonderful . Ran into a convention of auto dealers at the Drake Hotel . You hear the one about the astronaut who comes back from the first manned flight to Mars after two years ? His wife 's got a yea old kid . So he says `` All right . Who was it ? My friend Harry ? '' She says no . `` Oh , it was my friend Sammy . '' She says it was n't Sammy . `` Oh , I suppose it was my friend Lou . '' `` No , what 's the matter , do n't you think I have any friends of my own ? ! ''
SENATOR WALTZER: I 'll go you one further . I say the CIA and all its shadow organizations have ecome irrelevant at best and unconstitutional at worst . It 's time we throw a little light on the whole concept of the Pentagon 's `` black budget . '' These covert agency subgroups have confidential
ETHAN: You 're going to use Walter ?
PHELPS: He 's our guy .
ETHAN: Is n't he chairing the Armed Services hearing ?
PHELPS: Not this week . This week he 's flyfishing at the Oughterard Slough in County Kildare , with one of our best Irish guides .
ETHAN: He wo n't be back in a hurry ?
PHELPS: No , not in a hurry . What do you think ? You think the plot 'll work ?
ETHAN: Sure . If the main character does .
PHELPS: If you were me , Ethan , who would you < /u trust to make him believable ?
JACK: Sorry , am I interrupting ?
ETHAN: Always . JACK shows the gum to ETHAN .
JACK: Stick of gum . If you come up against a lock you ca n't pick Half the gum is red , the other half is green .
PHELPS: Are you gon na take it ?
ETHAN: Give me the God damn gum .
JACK: Just do n't chew it .
PHELPS: Thank you .
DIPLOMAT: How do you do , Senator , I 'm Rand Housman , the Ambassador 's aide . If I could just steer you through the reception line here
SARAH: I bet you do n't remember me , do you , Senator ?
SENATOR WALTZER: Of course I do . How are you , Miss Norman ?
SARAH: He 's in pocket . Under the archway behind me .
PHELPS: Sarah , mark the package and go to two .
SARAH: Your advance team mentioned you 'd want a tour of the facility , so I 've gone ahead and set that up for you
SENATOR WALTZER: Terrific . Let 's get going . Will you excuse us ?
DIPLOMAT: Uh , sir ?
JACK: Great . Come on .
PHELPS: Hannah . He 's marked . Lets go .
HANNAH: En route .
GUARD: Excuse me , can I help you ?
SARAH: which leads directly to the Denied Area , the only limited access area in the whole facility .
GUARD: Excuse me , let me see that ID again !
JACK: Relax your crack , Foghorn , I 'm workin ' on it .
GUARD: Oh . Sorry , sir .
JACK: The drink with Sarah is definitely off .
PHELPS: Hannah I 'm blind again . Hannah .
HANNAH: He 's heading to the denied area .
ETHAN: Higher . Higher .
SARAH: Higher .
ETHAN: Right , right . Good . SARAH adjusts the glasses .
PHELPS: Get moving , Ethan . He 's rolling to you .
ETHAN: Jack we 're in position .
JACK: I did n't touch it . The elevator stops , the doors open
PHELPS: He 's in the box , Ethan , he 's in the box !
ETHAN: OK . Taking Golitsyn 's exit . Jack , open the doors .
SARAH: What about my coat ? I 'll freeze .
PHELPS: Opening the doors . Go under . He jabs ENTER on his keyboard .
ETHAN: He 's got it . Saved your ass again Jack .
SARAH: Such a nice ass .
ETHAN: Sarah 's reconsidering . Claire , transport in five minutes .
HANNAH: En route . HANNAH breaks off and goes up the stairs .
JACK: Hey .
PHELPS: Jack , what are you doing ? !
JACK: Iím not doing anything ! .
PHELPS: I donít have it I donít havecontrol !
JACK: Uh then I have a problem .
ETHAN: Cut the power . Cut the power Jack . Do you hear me .
PHELPS: Man down . Stay where you are . Iím on my way . He gets up and races out of the apartment .
SARAH: The package is in the open .
ETHAN: Jim . Jim . Heís in the open .
SARAH: Ethan . Heís out of pocket .
ETHAN: Jim we canít .
SARAH: Jim gave an abort , we should walk away .
ETHAN: No , weíre going to recover the disk , understand ? ! Now move !
ETHAN: JIM !
ETHAN: Central Europe . Unsecured .
KITTRIDGE: I ca n't tell you how sorry I am . I know how much Jim in particular meant to you , Ethan . Personally as well as professionally .
ETHAN: Yeah . He spots a stack of documents on the table .
KITTRIDGE: Passport , visas - you know the drill . We 'll work the exfiltration thru Canada , debrief you at Langley . Throw the Prague police a bone , you know toss them a few suspects . Follow me ?
ETHAN: Yeah . I follow you .
KITTRIDGE: We 've lost enough agents for one night .
KITTRIDGE: You seem hell bent on blaming yourself , Ethan .
ETHAN: Who else is left ?
KITTRIDGE: Yes . I see your point .
ETHAN: Why was there another team ?
KITTRIDGE: What ?
ETHAN: Of IMF agents . At the Embassy . Tonight .
KITTRIDGE: I do n't quite follow you .
ETHAN: Let 's see if you can follow me around this room . The drunk Russians on the embankment at 7 and 8 o'clockThe couple waltzing around me at the Embassy at 9 and 11 . The waiter behind Hannah at the top of the staircase - Bowtie , 12 o'clock . The other IMF team . You 're worried about me . u > Why ?
KITTRIDGE: You 're right . Maybe this 'll save some time .
ETHAN: The arms dealer .
KITTRIDGE: That 's right . Max , it seems , has two unique gifts a capacity for anonymity and for corrupting susceptible agents . This time he 's gotten to someone on the inside - he 's put himself in a position to buy our NOC list . An operation he eferred to as `` Job 314 '' . The job he thought Golitsyn was doing tonight .
ETHAN: But the list Golitsyn stole was a decoy .
KITTRIDGE: Correct the actual list is safe at Langley . `` Golitsyn '' was a lightning rod , one of ours .
ETHAN: This whole operation was a molehunt .
KITTRIDGE: Yes , the mole 's deep inside . And like you said . You survived . ETHAN stares at him levelly .
ETHAN: How about if we just go quietly into the athroom and I wash your mouth out with soap - you pathetic button down ureaucratic asshole .
KITTRIDGE: All right , enough is enough Hunt . You 've ibed , cajoled , killed - and relied on intimate loyalties to get away with it . You 're determined to shake hands with the devil and I 'm going to make sure you do it in hell .
ETHAN: Job . Job 3 14 . March fourteen . Job 31 March . The computer replies
BIBLE: The computer replies
ETHAN: Max Goods tainted . Consider extremely hazardous . DO NOT USE . Fate will be that of kings and counsellors who built for themselves palaces now lying in uins . Must meet to discuss a.s.a.p .
PHELPS: Ethan , what are you doing ?
ETHAN: What are you doing here ? ! CLAIRE freezes , her hands half-raised .
CLAIRE: Ethan Ethan , it 's okay . It 's Claire . Ethan what 's wrong with you ?
ETHAN: Do n't move .
CLAIRE: I was n't . I heard that Jim was in trouble on the radio . He said someone was
ETHAN: Shut up ! I saw you . You were in the car .
CLAIRE: No , I got out of the car and I ran to the idge .
ETHAN: Do n't give me that ! I was on the bridge .
CLAIRE: What happened to Jim ?
ETHAN: There was nobody on the bridge .
CLAIRE: What happened to Jim ? Ethan grabs her wrists , shouting .
ETHAN: Dead . Dead . Dead ! Wake up , Claire ! Jim 's dead , they 're dead . They 're all dead ! ETHAN releases her wrists .
CLAIRE: They 're dead . Jim 's dead .
ETHAN: Take off your coat .
CLAIRE: What ?
ETHAN: Take off your God damn coat !
CLAIRE: I walked away . He said abort . He was gone so I walked away .
ETHAN: That was four hours ago ! Who sent you ? Did they send you here ?
CLAIRE: Who is `` they ? ''
ETHAN: Did they send youDid they send you ?
CLAIRE: Who is they , who is they ? ETHAN grabs her by the wrists .
ETHAN: Who sent you ? ! Who sent you ?
CLAIRE: No one sent me ! We 're supposed to be ack here at four o'clock , four o'clock , if we abort , we do n't return here until four o'clock , 0-four hundred , four am , four o'clock !
ETHAN: I 've been disavowed . They think I killed Jim and everyone else . Somehow a hundred thousand dollars found its way into my parents ' bank account . Kittridge assumes I 'm a mole they 've been tracing and I 've een in the employ of an arms dealer , Max , for the last two years , to get him our NOC list .
CLAIRE: What are you going to do ?
ETHAN: I 'm going to get it for him . Whoever the mole is , I think goes by the name of Job , at least part of the time . 1 ca n't find him , but if he knows 1 have the NOC list , he 'll find me .
CLAIRE: Ethan , you 're not making sense . Let me go in and talk to Kittridge . I 'm going to tell him you had nothing to do
ETHAN: Claire , Claire , Claire , if you 're not dead , he 's going to assume you 're with me .
CLAIRE: The message is for Job .
ETHAN: I 'm going to answer it .
MATTHIAS: Would you remove your hat please ?
ETHAN: Why ?
MATTHIAS: You wish to meet Max ? This is the price of admission .
ETHAN: I thought I was going to see Max .
MATTHIAS: You misunderstood . No one sees Max .
ETHAN: Then what am I doing here ?
MATTHIAS: Allowing Max to see you and hear what you 've got to say .
ETHAN: I do n't communicate very well through a shroud .
MATTHIAS: If Max does n't like what you have to say , you 'll be wearing that shroud indefinitely .
ETHAN: I 'm willing to take the chance .
MATTHIAS: Very well .
MAX: Who are you and what are you doing here ?
ETHAN: I need one hundred thousand dollars .
MAX: Really ? And you thought if you simply showed up I might give it to you ?
ETHAN: Why not ? You gave Job a hundred and twenty five thousand .
ETHAN: That depends .
MAX: On what ?
ETHAN: Whether you like a paradox . I want a hundred and fifty thousand dollars .
MAX: It 's quite out of the question .
ETHAN: The disk Job sold you is worthless . It 's ait , part of an internal molehunt .
MAX: And how might you know that ? Are you another Company man ?
ETHAN: Like Job ?
MAX: Ah , but , we 're asking about you .
ETHAN: I 'm NOC . Was . Now disavowed .
MAX: Why , may I ask ?
ETHAN: That 's the question I want to ask Job .
MAX: I do n't know Job any more than he knows me .
ETHAN: Even so , I 'm sure you could arrange an introduction .
MAX: Why should I ?
ETHAN: Because I can deliver the actual NOC list . The one you have is not only worthless , it 's certain to be equipped with a homing device to pinpoint you exact location .
MAX: It 's easy to say the disk is worthless when you say I ca n't look at the information and see if it 's worthless . Not a tenable position , sir .
ETHAN: Okay , boot it up and in anywhere from thirty seconds to ten minutes you 're gon na have Virginia farm boys hopping around you like jackrabbits .
MAX: Mm - Hmmm
ETHAN: Tell you what . How good 's the RF scanne you used in the car ?
MAX: Very good .
ETHAN: Okay , use it . But I suggest pack up first .
MATTHIAS: Twenty-six , twenty-seven . So far so good .
MAX: That 's not so good for you , my friend .
MATTHIAS: Thirty-two and change .
MAX: Does n't mean it 's a signal . Could just e the hard drive heating up .
MATTHIAS: Forty-four . Forty-five .
ETHAN: I 'd say you 've got about two minutes .
MATTHIAS: Fifty-seven . Fifty-nine .
FEMALE IMF: Switch it on . Keep cleaning .
KITTRIDGE: GOD D-
MAX: Oh dear , Gunther will never let me use one of his apartments again . Phew , sorry I doubted you , dear boy . You 're a good sport . Do accept the compliment .
ETHAN: Thanks , Max . Or is it Maxine ?
MAX: I do n't have to tell you what a comfort anonymity can be in my profession like a warm blanket . My deal with Job was subject to a successful boot scan . Obviously it did n't pass muster . Deal 's off .
ETHAN: What was your deal with Job ?
MAX: Six million dollars . I 'll give you the same . But I want the complete list now , not just Eastern Europe . I wo n't do this piecemeal , it 's too dangerous . I want
MAX: Done . Bring it to me in London . I want it by the end of the week .
ETHAN: How will you make sure Job will be there ?
MAX: How will you make sure I 'll have the list in three days ? It 's been a delight . Now where can I drop you dear boy ?
ETHAN: I 'm not being dropped anywhere without my money .
MAX: I 'm going to have to front you personally . Do n't lose that money without losing your life .
ETHAN: I would n't dream of it .
KITTRIDGE: The man 's gone black , Barnes . He 's unde until he decides to surface .
BARNES: Look we can use someone from the Embassy and we can get the local authorities involved . Close off his transportation .
KITTRIDGE: What can we do , Barnes ? Put a guy at the airport ? How many identities do you think Hunt has ? How many times has he slipped past custom , in how many countries ? These guys are trained to be
BARNES: So what do you suggest ?
KITTRIDGE: Let 's not waste time chasing him . Make him come to us . Everybodyís got pressure points . Find out something that 's important to him personally and you squeeze .
CLAIRE: Max made a deal with you ?
ETHAN: I deliver the NOC list , Max delivers Job .
CLAIRE: We 've got seventy-five rounds for you Glock 9 , but only twenty for the Sig Sauer , one pair of Visco glasses with monitor , plenty of passports . You said it yourself if I 'm not dead , I 'm with you .
ETHAN: You 're sure about this ?
CLAIRE: Jim was my husband . I want to know who killed him . I want to get the son of a bitch who did this .
ETHAN: We need help , and we do n't have time . They have to be local .
CLAIRE: What kind of help ?
CATEGORY?: He types in a single word .
ETHAN: Simple game . Four players . Exfil opens the pocket cyber ops lifts the wallet .
KRIEGER: Bank ?
ETHAN: IMF mainframe .
KRIEGER: Where exactly is it ?
ETHAN: In Langley .
LUTHER: In Langley ? The one in Virginia , Langley ?
KRIEGER: Inside CIA headquarters at Langley . ETHAN nods . KRIEGER turns to CLAIRE .
CLAIRE: Always .
KRIEGER: If we 're going to Virginia , why do n't we drop by Fort Knox ? I can fly a helicopter right in through the lobby and set it down inside the vault and it will e a hell of a lot easier than breaking into the God damn CIA .
LUTHER: What are we downloading ?
ETHAN: Information .
LUTHER: What kind ?
ETHAN: Profitable .
CLAIRE: Payment on delivery .
LUTHER: I do n't know . This I do n't know .
ETHAN: This does n't sound like the Luthe Stickell I 've heard of . What 'd they used to call you ? The Net Ranger ? Phineas Phreak ? The only man alive who actually hacked NATO Ghostcom .
LUTHER: There was never any physical evidence that I had anything to do with that.. that.. With that exceptional piece of work .
ETHAN: You do n't know what you 're missing . This is the Mt . Everest of hacks .
LUTHER: You 're all kidding yourselves . Even with top of the line crypto . Cray access . STU 3 's
CLAIRE: Krieger can get it . Right ?
KRIEGER: May take a little time .
ETHAN: May take a little time . That 's not what Claire tells me about you .
LUTHER: Thinking Machine laptops , I 'm talking about the 686 prototypes with the artificial intelligence Risk chip ETHAN looks at KRIEGER .
KRIEGER: Twenty-four hours . ETHAN looks back at LUTHER . LUTHER thinks .
LUTHER: And I get to keep the equipment when we 're done .
ETHAN: Luther , I guess you 're all out of excuses .
LUTHER: I ca n't just hack my way inside . There 's no modem access to the mainframe , it 's in a stand-alone . I 'd have to be physically at the terminal .
ETHAN: Luther , relax , it 's worse than you think . The terminal 's in black vault lock-down .
LUTHER: And you really think we can do this .
ETHAN: May I come in ?
CLAIRE: Sure
ETHAN: It 's cash . And a second passport . If anything goes wrong when we 're inside , if you sense even the slightest deviation do n't look over your shoulder , you walk away - you hear me ? Just walk away .
CLAIRE: You do n't think we 're going to make it .
ETHAN: I did n't say that .
CLAIRE: You did n't have to
ETHAN: I just need you to be safe .
CLAIRE: What about you ?
ETHAN: What about me - Jim called an abort - I did n't comply . I lost the team . I just need you to be safe .
CLAIRE: I wish I 'd never laid eyes on you..
ETHAN: Sorry .
BARNES: What I want to know is how Hunt accessed the disavowed file , even after we cut off his authorization code .
MAREK: He may have used Phelps ' code . They were friends , and Phelps , was still valid fo twenty-four hours .
BARNES: If that 's the case , we need to implement a system to immediately deactivate an agent 's code immediately
KITTRIDGE: I ca n't believe what I 'm listening to .
LOWDEN: Survival .
KITTRIDGE: Too short sighted . This guy 's proactive ,
AGENT: Fire alarm , Gene .
KITTRIDGE: Oh , for do we have to evacuate ?
BARNES: That 's S.O.P..
KITTRIDGE: S.O.P..
ETHAN: We picked up alarms in sectors three , seven , and twelve . The GUARD checks a screen in front of him .
GUARD RICHARD: Yeah . That 's what I 've got too .
ETHAN: What sector 's the air conditioning ?
GUARD RANDALL: Uh twenty-one , but there 's no alarm in sector twenty-one .
ETHAN: I got ta go in there and shut it down !
GUARD RANDALL: Nobody goes into any sector where the alarm did n't go off .
GUARD: and it did not go off in twenty-one !
LUTHER: Twenty-one , twenty-one
GUARD RANDALL: Wait ! Hold it - it 's on . Let 's go .
ETHAN: Let 's move !
LUTHER: Hi there .
GUARD: Air conditioning 's through here ! They turn a corner , walking directly past
CIA ANALYST: William Donloe .
GUARD: Where 's the other guy ?
ETHAN: Zero body count .
KRIEGER: We 'll see .
ETHAN: Time up . ETHAN releases him and walks away .
TECHNICIAN: Oh , God . he vomits .
LUTHER: Type this password AW96B6 . Return . Go to the files menu , find the NOC list file . Open `` NOC List . '' Put you diskette in . Double click on the NOC list .
LUTHER: Holy mother of God .
KRIEGER: Merci .
ETHAN: We 're not outta here yet .
KITTRIDGE: Think , for Christ 's sake , you guys are mired in detail , open your minds , it 's got ta be staring us in the face ! What does Ethan Hunt want ? !
BARNES: Same thing he wanted in Prague ! Same thing he 's always wanted ! The NOC list !
KITTRIDGE: Okay !
AGENT: It 's for you .
KITTRIDGE: Kittridge , yup ?
BARNES: What about him ?
KITTRIDGE: I want him manning a radar tower in Alaska by the end of the day . Just mail him his clothes .
KRIEGER: You contacting your buyer ? Ethan ?
ETHAN: My contact is extremely shy .
KRIEGER: I do n't think you 're in any position to give orders , do you ? Not while I 'm holding this .
CLAIRE: Krieger .
KRIEGER: Stay out of this .
OR: Lachez - moi
ETHAN: Do n't you mean this ?
KRIEGER: That 's not it . That 's not the list .
ETHAN: What 's the matter , you do n't know this trick ?
KRIEGER: Where is it ?
ETHAN: I thought you had it ! Do you actually think I 'd let you have the NOC list ?
KRIEGER: Try any sleight-of-hand with my money and Iíll cut your throat .
CLAIRE: I 'm so sorry . Krieger was my call . I 've never worked with him . I 'm sorry , Ethan .
ETHAN: We did what we had to do .
CLAIRE: I 'm going to try and get some sleep .
LUTHER: Krieger did have the NOC list .
ETHAN: Now I want you to hold onto it .
LUTHER: What makes you trust me ?
ETHAN: Because if you knew what you were getting into , you never would have done it .
LUTHER: I 'm not letting this list get out in the open .
ETHAN: Exactly , that 's your job . Tomorrow on the train , you ca n't let this list get out into the open . What 's the range of this thing ?
LUTHER: It 's hard to tell . I 'm gon na have to be close .
ETHAN: I 'll get you close . Claire opens the door .
CLAIRE: Ethan I need to talk to you .
ANCHOR: The unlikely settinga farm in the heartland of Americathe State of Wisconsin , where federal agents claim to have broken the brain trust behind an international drug ring . For a report we go live now to CNN correspondent in the state capitol , Madison . ?
REPORTER: Authorities have identified the couple as Margaret Ethan Hunt and Donald Hunt .
REPORTER: Mr. Fairchild , agent Fairchild , a comment please .
PUBLIC OFFICIAL: I think it 's sad , really . Farmers , unless they 're a conglomerate , are always operating on a paper-thin margin . I 'm afraid what we have here is a case of a naive and lonely widow with a lot of financial problems who chose to make money through illegal means .
REPORTER: That was John Fairchild , the DEA agent in charge of this investigation . Officials tell me that international law enforcement agents are expected to arrive here later today to question the Hunts . This is Joe Jones , CNN , Love in Madison , Wisconsin .
ETHAN: Kittridge
CLAIRE: Bastard !
ETHAN: Don'tdo n't touch me CAMERA SWING PANS between them .
CLAIRE: What are you going to do ?
ETHAN: He 's expecting my call . I 'm going to the station And I 'm going to call him .
KITTRIDGE: Kittridge .
ETHAN: Hauling Mom off to jail in shackles was an especially nice touch .
TECHNICIAN: He 's in England .
KITTRIDGE: Get MI5 .
ETHAN: If you 're dealing with someone who 's crushed , stabbed , shot and detonated five members of his own IMF team , how devastated do you think you 're going to make him by marching Ma and Uncle Donald down to the county courthouse ?
KITTRIDGE: I do n't know , Ethan . Suppose you tell me ?
BARNES: Lost him . We needed three more seconds .
KITTRIDGE: He wanted us to know he was in London .
PHELPS: You 're a hard man to catch up with .
ETHAN: - and picked us up in the States -
PHELPS: - but you left before I could get there and I could check just so many places..
ETHAN: Yeah , smaller countries do n't computerize customs records -
PHELPS: - so I watched Europe . Once you showed up in England..it was easy .
ETHAN: You knew I liked the rentals at Liverpool Street .
PHELPS: Hey , I showed 'em to you !
ETHAN: I remember..
PHELPS: I can sit up straight . I just can't..sit up straight very well . It 's not important ! I saw who shot me . Ethan , I saw the mole . It was Kittridge . i > Kittridge ! < /i PHELPS grips the sides of the table .
ETHAN: Kitteridge . Oh my god ! Kittridge is the mole ?
PHELPS: Yeah .
ETHAN: How did Kittridge do it ? ..
ETHAN VO: - first he took care of Jack in the elevator -
ETHAN: Why , Jim ? Why ? < /i Awkward moment .
PHELPS: ..when you think about it , Ethan , it was inevitable..no more Cold War . No more secrets you keep from everyone but yourself , operations you answer to no one ut yourself . Then one morning you wake up and find out the President of the United States is running the country - i > without your permission . The son-of-a- itch ! How dare he ? You realize itís over , youíre an obsolete piece of hardware not worth upgrading , youíve got a lousy marriage and sixty-two grand a year . Kittridge , weíll go after that no good son-of-a-bitch , big time !
ETHAN: We donít have to , Jim . Heíll come afte us .
PHELPS: Whatís going to make him do that ?
ETHAN: What he didnít get in Prague . The NOC list .
PHELPS: Jesus , Ethan . Good for you .
ETHAN: A meeting tomorrow on the TGV , enroute to Paris .
PHELPS: Tight security . No guns . Real plus .
ETHAN: If I supposedly deliver the NOC list to Max , Max has agreed to deliver Job to me . Iíll have Claire and Luther Stickell with me on the train . Marcel Krieger will have helicopter transport waiting in Paris . PHELPS looks away . Seems badly shaken .
PHELPS: I was sitting in a cafe waiting for you and suddenly there she was , standing in the rain just outside the safe house..alive and beautiful..and thinking Iím dead and gone . God knows what sheís had to do forget about me to keep going and get the job done , I..
ETHAN: Youíre probably right .
PHELPS: I usually am .
ETHAN: Once we leave the safehouse , get in there and crash . Iíll call you from Paris .
PHELPS: You got it .
ETHAN: And get a doctor .
PHELPS: Good luck .
CLAIRE: What happened ?
ETHAN: I sent the message to Max . Weíre on fo tomorrow .
CLAIRE: Okay
ETHAN: Is this the only way ?
CLAIRE: Yes.come here.viens pres moi She draws him down by his hand to kiss her .
KITTRIDGE: How long to the London Terminus ?
AGENT: Twenty , twenty-five minutes .
KITTRIDGE: Youíve got ten . Move !
MAX: How long until we reach the Chunnel ?
MATTHIAS: Twenty minutes .
MAX: This wasnít what we discussed .
MAX: Ha , dear boy ! I do hope this doesnít prelude a meeting in private .
BARNES: Only four more cars .
KITTRIDGE: And if we donít find him - weíll search the whole train again .
BARNES: Whatís Hunt doing on the TGV ?
KITTRIDGE: High speed train . No-one gets on . No- one gets off . High security . Good place for a pass off to Max .
BARNES: But why tell us ?
KITTRIDGE: Heís putting on a show , Barnes .
BARNES: What kind of show .
KITTRIDGE: I donít know . It didnít say on the tickets .
CLAIRE: EthanKittridge is on the train .
ETHAN: Kittridge is Job . Max delivered . How far is he from Luther ?
CLAIRE: Two cars . Where are you ?
ETHAN: You are my eyes . Stay with him .
MAX: Heís in the baggage car .
MAX: Whatís the problem .
MATTHIAS: Connection denied .
MAX: Try it again .
MATTHIAS: Itís not working .
MAX: Is something wrong with the phone ? Well is something wrong with the atteries ?
MATTHIAS: I always check the batteries .
MAX: Run it through from the top .
BARNES: Nothing but civilians , Gene .
KITTRIDGE: This is bullshit - we donít even know what Max looks like .
BARNES: Maybe we donít have to know what he looks like . If heís got that list , heís going to want to check it . We should be looking for laptops .
KITTRIDGE: Good idea .
WAITER: Excuse me , Sir , your telephone
MATTHIAS: Itís working .
MAX: Phew ! Weíve got five minutes
KITTRIDGE: Get this door open .
LUTHER: Mr. Kittridge , the NOC list is being modemed off the train .
KITTRIDGE: Where ?
CLAIRE: Ethanís right behind me . Listen to me Jim . Is it such a good idea to kill him ? We take the money . Ethan takes the lame . No-one else has seen you alive . No-one will believe him .
ETHAN: Of course - Iím sorry to hear you say that Claire .
CLAIRE: Ethan ?
PHELPS: Yes . Ethan Hunt , darling . Remember him ? Here PHELPS pulls out his assembled pistol .
CLAIRE: You knew about Jim ?
PHELPS: Course he did . Just exactly when he knew is something of a question . Before o after I showed in London , mind telling me , Ethan ?
ETHAN: Before London . But after you took the Bible out of the Drake Hotel in Chicago .
PHELPS: They stamped it , didnít they ? Those damn Gideons . PHELPíS watch alarm goes off .
CLAIRE: Ethan , if you knew about Jim ? ..Why..
PHELPS: Why the masquerade ? Why take the risk ? Well , Claire , youíve asked the question and you are the answer .
ETHAN: I knew about Jim .
PHELPS: But , he didnít know about you . In all fairness , Ethan , Claire was neve convinced her charms would work with you . But I was supremely confident - having tastes the goods . `` Thou shall not covet thy Neighbourís wife '' , Ethan . Oh , Ethan is in love with you , Claire , make no mistake about it . And like all the worldís lovers , heís tortured by the same , one pathetic question - `` does she feel the same way I do ? '' JIM turns to CLAIRE .
CLAIRE: Jim - lets just get the money and get out of here . CLAIRE goes to ETHAN .
ETHAN: Youíve earned it . CLAIRE goes to Jim with the money .
PHELPS: Count it . CLAIRE starts to count .
ETHAN: Tell me something Claire , that night in Prague , was it you or Jim that blew up the car and scattered Hannah all ove town ?
PHELPS: Keep counting Claire .
CLAIRE: It was me . I did it . CLAIRE hands PHELPS the money .
PHELPS: Satisfied ?
CLAIRE: All ten million .
PHELPS: Fold it . Fold it tight .
ETHAN: Arenít you going to thank me Jim . Ten million is better than six .
PHELPS: Donít flatter yourself - six was fo
ETHAN: Youíre wrong about one thing . Iím not the only one whoís seen you alive . ETHAN throws JIM the Visco glasses .
KITTRIDGE: Good morning , Mr Phelps . PHELPS and CLAIRE are stunned .
PHELPS: You son of a bitch . PHELPS points the gun at ETHAN .
CLAIRE: Donít Jim .
PHELPS: Now we donít have to eliminate him ? You like that , donít you Claire ? Donít you ?
CLAIRE: Yes .
ETHAN: Jim , itís over .
PHELPS: Ethan - Iíve always taught you , nothing can be more dangerous than the truth . It can kill you .
ETHAN: ClaireHey
CLAIRE: This stuff is so sticky .
ETHAN: Claire .
CLAIRE: Itís all right , Ethan..youíll bring me ackwonít you
ETHAN: I always have , Claire..
MAX: Damn !
CONDUCTOR: No , no , it 's IN the tunnel !
ETHAN: Red light , green light . Asta Lasagna mother fucker .
LUTHER: I think this is what you 're looking for .
MAX: My lawyers will have a field day with this . Entrapment , jurisdictional conflicts
KITTRIDGE: Maybe we 'll just keep the courts out of this one .
MAX: I 'm sure we can find something I have that you need .
KITTRIDGE: You know , I would love to try .
LUTHER: Reach your folks ? How they feeling ?
ETHAN: About what ?
LUTHER: The official apology from the Justice Department , the VIP treatment , you know , the whole nine yards .
ETHAN: Well my Mother was a little confused about how the DEA could mistake her and Uncle Donald for a couple of dope smugglers in the Florida keys . LUTHER picks up his beer .
LUTHER: Cheers . They drink .
ETHAN: Here 's to you , Luther . To eing off the disavowed list .
LUTHER: Hey , I 'm the flavour of the month !
ETHAN: You 're more than that , Luther . They were mistaken about you and they 're trying to show you they know it . They want you ack in .
LUTHER: Sure . They want me back in so I wo n't eak in ! They still ca n't figure out how we did it .
ETHAN: You did n't tell 'em at the debriefing ?
LUTHER: I figured I 'd let 'em reinstate my back pay , give me a promotion , check out my
ETHAN: It 's all one big negotiation , is n't it ?
LUTHER: Why do n't you come back with me ?
ETHAN: Just do n't know why I 'd be doing it .
LUTHER: You really liked Phelps , did n't you ?
ETHAN: He was a good guy for a long , long time . Just - not long enough . Got ta catch my flight.. So . How 's it feel being a solid citizen again ?
LUTHER: Oh manI do n't know . I 'm gon na miss eing disreputable .
ETHAN: Well , Luther - if it makes you feel any etter I 'll always think of you that way .
FLIGHT ATTENDANT: Would you like to watch a movie , Miss Clarke ? She then stops before ETHAN .
ETHAN: No , thank you .
FLIGHT ATTENDANT: Would you consider the cinema of the Caribbean ?
GUARD: What 's this , then ?
NEKHORVICH: The ashes of a colleague , I 'm taking them to his family . If you wish to open it , please be careful .
CAPTAIN'S VOICE: - folks , we 're a little over two and a half hours from touchdown in Atlanta , but if you look out your windows on eithe side of the aircraft , we 'll soon be crossing the southern section of the Rocky Mountains , a range which includes more than 50 peaks rising above 14,000 feet . The chain 's loftiest point , Mount Elbert , at 14 , 433 feet should be coming into view as we pass over central Colorado shortly..
ETHAN: You keep staring at that watch as if you life depended on it , Doctor..
NEKHORVICH: Well , yes . I suppose I am a bit anxious .
ETHAN: They 're ready and waiting . You 'll soon be with old friends .
NEKHORVICH: I 'm with an old friend now , Dmitri .
ETHAN: Sorry it could n't be under happie circumstances .
NEKHORVICH: Yes , I 'm sorry too.. 'You 're sorry and I 'm sorry.. '
ETHAN: He was quite a man . Did he know before the end you two had succeeded ?
NEKHORVICH: Yes , he knew . Just..
ETHAN: ..not in time to save him .
ETHAN: You carry them together ? Safely ? With an almost impish grin and a wink
NEKHORVICH: Yes , and you 'll get us to a safe place with them , thank god ! ..left to my own devices , I 'm an old fart too inept to read a railroad timetable ! ..
CAPTAIN'S VOICE: You Captain again . We 've experienced a slight but abrupt drop in cabin pressure..
CAPTAIN: Pan , pan , pan , Denver Center . This is Trans Pac Flight two-two-zero-seven , 747 heavy . We are not reading you . We 're unable to maintain cabin pressurization . We have initiated a descent to one six thousand .
NEKHORVICH: ..it seems we have a problem , Dmitri .
ETHAN: You keep calling me Dmitri . You really should n't . Nekhorvich 's eyes narrow .
NEKHORVICH: You 're not Dmitri ?
ETHAN: - no . He grabs the satchel . ETHAN Wallis , hold onto it .
STAMP: All done , chief..
AMBROSE: - right - - do n't go too far ahead of me now -
STAMP: Not possible..
WALLIS: Checkpoint Charlie plus 30 , altitude minus two-zero-thousand . Airspeed one-seven- niner knots..
AMBROSE: It 's that time . Go .
VOICE: Terrain , terrain . Pull up , pull up .
ETHAN: Whoaa.. He pockets the lizard , climbs the overhang .
ELECTRONIC VOICE: Identity confirmed .
SWANBECK: Good morning , Mr. Hunt .
SWANBECK'S VOICE: Your mission , should you choose to accept it , requires you to recover a stolen item , designated Chimera . Essential to the mission is the recruitment of a civilian a Miss Nyah Nordoff-Hall . She is a highly capable professional thief currently active in Spain .
ETHAN: If I let you know where I 'm going - The glasses explode in a puff of smoke . ETHAN - wo n't be on holiday .
NYAH: No . Should I ?
ETHAN: No . You just looked as if you did .
NYAH: No . Just as if I 'd like to .
ETHAN: Oh . Well . I think that can be arranged .
NYAH: Not tonight . Bad timing . Sorry -
ETHAN: There 's not enough time in the world fo any of it to be bad .
NYAH: Look , it 's either you or the rent and I do n't mind telling you it 's not an easy choice .
ETHAN: What if I pay the rent ?
NYAH: Uh-huh .
ETHAN: Uh-huh ?
NYAH: Go find the wealthy lady you came with and next time we meet - I 'll pay your rent . Now bugger off .
ETHAN: Decisions , decisions .
NYAH: What are you doing here ?
ETHAN: Think you 're the only one who can pick a lock ?
NYAH: I see . You 're not just another pretty face..
ETHAN: I take it you prefer tenors .
NYAH: Would you mind if I 'm on top ?
ETHAN: Oh , either way works for me .
ETHAN'S VOICE: You 're never gon na find it there .
NYAH: Damn it ! Find what ?
ETHAN: His ex-wife 's Bulgari necklace that goes up for auction Tuesday .
NYAH: - right..where is it ?
ETHAN: Far right .
NYAH: Where 's the bloody -
ETHAN: - torque wrench .
NYAH: - this is very disconerting..
ETHAN: Hey , you put me here . I just do what I 'm told .
NYAH: - right..
ETHAN: I would n't do that .
NYAH: Do what ? The alarm goes off .
ETHAN: That .
NYAH: Oh yes . Absolutely . Much too long I should yes .
ETHAN: Under the circumstances I think we would ecommend re-setting the senors to espond to a lighter load . How do you feel about forty kilos , Miss Hall ?
NYAH: Indeed .
ETHAN: Well , Senor de l'Arena , there 's no reason to disrupt your party any longer . we have some further concerns about the disposition of your security guards , which you 'll eceive in our written report by fax in the morning , hard copy to follow . Shall we ?
NYAH: The necklace ?
ETHAN: At least you walked .
NYAH: If you were n't going to let me get away with it , why did you let me go thru with it ?
ETHAN: Wanted to see how good you were . I 'm hoping we might work together .
NYAH: May I say something , no offence ? You look like a gigolo , you sound like a thief , you act like a cop - what the loody hell do you have in mind ?
ETHAN: Working under adverse conditions . Highly adverse conditions .
NYAH: Sounds smashing . I 'm in . Muchacho , mi carro , por favor ! Now be serious . You could n't possibly want me off tonight 's performance..
ETHAN: You did n't do that badly . Her car arrives .
NYAH: You 're apologizing for me ? Quite the gentleman..
ETHAN: Not really . I triggered the alarm..
NYAH: I do n't do laundry , or put up with cheeky bastards who set me up on thei territory so they can poach on mine .
ETHAN: Hi . Would you mind slowing down ?
NYAH: Where did you get this number ? I do n't even have it !
ETHAN' VOICE: Would you like it ?
ETHAN: Pull over and listen to me , will you ? Just listen..
NYAH: Listen to what ?
ETHAN: I need your help and I thin you can use mine .
NYAH: Your help ? What are you talking about ?
ETHAN: Scotland Yard , Interpol , every Dutch authority . I can make them go away .
NYAH: Oh bloody hell . You 're a spy .
ETHAN: I deserved that .
NYAH: Uh-oh .
ETHAN: No !
NYAH: Oh..oh.. Taking a firm grip on her wrist .
ETHAN: Do n't look down . Just..look at me . That 's it..that 's it..
NYAH: What 's you name ?
ETHAN: Ethan Hunt .
NYAH: Well , Ethan Hunt , what is it you want to talk to me about ?
ETHAN: more than I thought..
NYAH: Awfully short notice..
ETHAN: Care to wait a decent interval ?
NYAH: Who wants to be decent ? ..
ETHAN: So what 've you got against spooks ? Nyah smiles .
NYAH: When they 've got your recruiting technique ? Not a thing .
ETHAN: Oh . Well..this is n't exactly by the book .
NYAH: They 've got a book for this ?
ETHAN: They 've got a book for everything .
NYAH: The only other spook I knew was a liar . Charming but absolutely incapable of telling the truth . He 'd lie about his favorite color . But then I reckon it 's an occupational hazard . All spies really do is conceal the truth and tell lies .
ETHAN: Not revealing information does n't necessarily make someone a liar .
NYAH: That 's not the point . In the end what spies rely on is the one thing they think they know that you do n't .
ETHAN: Which is ?
NYAH: That they 're lying . Ethan laughs . NYAH ..once they know that they can get very very..crosee.. Nyah shoulder and moves into Ethan .
ETHAN: So where did I got right ?
NYAH: You 're not a liar . Or you 're an awfully good one.. ..this thing these blokes pinched..
ETHAN: I do n't know that they 'pinched ' it . Do n't even know that they 're blokes . Nyah stops to think about this .
NYAH: Well , then , what I am I doing here ? I assume I 'm meant to be some sort of thief-to catch-a-thief..
ETHAN: So do I . Sort of . Nyah looks at Ethan , a little worried .
NYAH: Spoken like a spook..you ever afraid ?
ETHAN: Of what ? Nyah laughs .
NYAH: Ask a question , you get an answer ! ..
ETHAN: Damn , you 're beautiful .
NYAH: That 's because I 'm on my back .
ETHAN: I do n't think so . She sinks into his arms .
VENDOR: Si , senor .
ETHAN: I 'll pick'em up on my way out , okay ?
SWANBECK: Fetival 's a pain in the ass . Honoring saint by setting'em on fire . Sit down , sit down . Ethan sits . SWANBECK Let 's you know what they think of saints , does n't it ? Damn near set me on fire on my way over here . As if I have n't been urned enough today .
ETHAN: Sorry I did n't let you know where I was .
ETHAN: Well . You 're sorry and I 'm sorry .
SWANBECK: Why did you phrase it like that ?
ETHAN: Like what ?
SWANBECK: 'You 're sorry and I 'm sorry . '
ETHAN: You got ta be kidding .
NEKHORVICH: Well , Dmitri ! How are you ? ..
ETHAN: ..I 'm fine..and you ?
NEKHORVICH: I 'm fine.. Ethan laughs .
ETHAN: I 'm fine and you 're fine.. With Ethan simultaneously whispering
NEKHORVICH: I 'm fine too.. I 'm fine and you 're fine - do you remember , dear fried , how you got Sergei and I to repeat those lines from Dr. Strangelove and we gave you the name of that silly Soviet Premier because we did n't know your name ? ..In those days , you not only saved our lives , you saved our sanity . 'Now , then Dmitri - we have this little problem ' Every search for a hero must begin with something that every hero requires ; a villain . Therefore , in a search for ou hero , Bellerophon , we created a monste Chimera . I beg you , Dmitri , come to Sydney and accompany me to Atlanta immediately . However we travel , I must arrive at me destination , within 20 hours of departure . Forgive this fanciful explanation , but fo now prudence dictates that I communicate nothing but the gravest urgency . I fear I can entrust this to no one but you , Dmitri . as we say , ' I 'm sorry and you 're sorry'.. Swanbeck stops the DVD .
SWANBECK: Let me ask you something . You have any idea what the hell he 's talking about ? Ethan smiles .
ETHAN: An idea , yeah .
SWANBECK: Like ?
ETHAN: Like it 's a good idea to pick him up in a hurry . And a bad idea to fly him on a commercial carrier . So let 's get on with it . He 's still in Sydney ?
SWANBECK: Dr. Vladimir Nekhorvich is dead . So is his colleague , Gradski , but that happened earlier . We had Nekhorvich on a flight from Sydney that crashed in the Rockies.. Ethan sits back , heavily . SWANBECK - Hunt , are you listening ? .. Slowly looking up
ETHAN: If he did n't want to go anywhere without me , how did you get him on the flight ?
SWANBECK: You were there .
SWANBECK: When I could n't find you , I had to replace you . Sean Ambrose was the obvious choice . He double you , what ? Two , three times ?
ETHAN: Twice .
SWANBECK: What did you think of him ?
ETHAN: You know we had reservations about each other . Is n't it a little late in the day to be asking me that ?
SWANBECK: Not necessarily .
ETHAN: So there 's one thing we know Ambrose does n't .
SWANBECK: Then you do think it was Ambrose . Ethan barely nods . SWANBECK And you 're not surprised . Ethan gives Swanbeck a look .
ETHAN: Whatever Nekhorvich was carrying Sean wanted and he wanted to conceal the fact that he took it .
SWANBECK: Enough to kill Nekhorvich and two hundred innocent passengers ? Ethan smiles .
ETHAN: Sean feels he has n't done the job unless he leaves a lot of hats on the ground .
SWANBECK: The question is why ? What was this Chimera Nekhorvich was carrying ? Ethan rises and moves to the window .
ETHAN: Right now only Ambrose knows that .
SWANBECK: In any case , you 've got to recover Chimera and bring it to us .
ETHAN: In order to do that , I 've got to figure out how he plans to make money with it .
SWANBECK: - right . In fact since the plane went down our banking sources have confirmed a marked increase in the stock pilling of cash in terrorists accounts .
ETHAN: 'Terrorists ? '
SWANBECK: Well you know Nekhorvich 's history . You 're the one who got him out of the Soviet Union was it still in bio- weapon business .
ETHAN: If that 's what you 're thinking Ambrose would have set up a bidding situation with any number of buyers before he got on the plane . Locating him in time to stop something like that -
SWANBECK: - is where Miss Hall comes in .
ETHAN: Excuse me ?
SWANBECK: Miss Hall and Ambrose had a relationship which he took very seriously . She walked away and he 's wanting her back eve since . We believe she 's our surest and quickest way of location him .
ETHAN: And then what ?
SWANBECK: Then makes sure she continues to see him . Gets him confide in her and report to you .
ETHAN: You made it sound as if I was recruiting her for her skills as a thief .
SWANBECK: Well , then I mislead you . Or you made the wrong assumption . Either way we 're asking her to resume a prior relationship , not do anything she has n't already done .
ETHAN: She 's got no training for this kind of thing .
SWANBECK: Go to bed with a man and lie to him ? She 's a woman . She 's got all the training she needs .
ETHAN: I do n't think I can get her to do it .
SWANBECK: You mean it 'll be difficult .
ETHAN: Very .
SWANBECK: Well it 's not mission difficult , Hunt .
STREET VENDOR: Senor , senor ! Your flowers .
ETHAN: Yes . They 're very nice..
ETHAN: Five , six-hundred thousand .
NYAH: There 's nearly 2 million in London .
ETHAN: And six billion in the world .
NYAH: That 's lot of people out there..how many of them , I wonder , are capable of something like that ?
ETHAN: Sean Ambrose , for one . A long shocked moment . Nyah laughs .
NYAH: Right
ETHAN: This was n't what I had in mind , Nyah .
NYAH: But it is what you 'd like me to do . so tell me to do it.. She approaches Ethan . They 're inches apart . NYAH Come on , out with it . Tell me to go and insinuate myself back into Sean 's life .
ETHAN: Go and insinuate yourself back into Sean 's life .
NYAH: I 'd like a little more conviction..
ETHAN: So would I . But it 's not mine to give .
NYAH: You 've either got it or you do n't . Let your conscience be your guide ?
ETHAN: Something like that . With a smile and a wink .
NYAH: But I do n't have a conscience . I 'm a loody thief .
ETHAN: You can be a thief and have a conscience .
NYAH: No . You can be a thief and have a conscience Not me . Why did you have to tell me about this ! What do I have to do to get away from this guy ? When you 're with him , he messes about with your head every waking moment..even now I 'll be at some out-of- the-way-place , a tin of caviar and a ottle of Crystal shows up at the table , with two glass , God knows how he finds out at any given moment where I am in the world but he does . And it looks like he 's done it again . You know his definition of a true paranoid ?
ETHAN: I do n't .
NYAH: Someone in possession of all the facts . Are you telling me I have to do this ?
ETHAN: Generally , I do n't favor coercing someone . Not when there 's a chance my life could end up in their hands .
NYAH: And that 's the only reason ?
ETHAN: Can you think of a better one ?
NYAH: Not me . I was just hoping you might..o that..somehow in the course of business this got personal as well as physical .
ETHAN: Look , would it make you feel better if I did n't want you to do this ?
NYAH: Much .
ETHAN: Then feel better ! .. Long moment while she looks at him . ETHAN Well . That made all the difference in the world , did n't it ?
NYAH: Sean will never be anything but suspicious if he picks up some sort of 'yoo-hoo-I'm- not-nad ' message . Not after the way we oke up .
ETHAN: What would n't make him suspicious ?
NYAH: Probably that I needed him in some urgent way..destitute - in serious trouble..the kind I could n't possible sort out myself.. Ethan 's been smiling slightly .
ETHAN: Serious trouble , Nyah , is something I can always arrange..
ETHAN'S VOICE: When it 's in your ankle we can track you within three feet of anywhere in the world .
ETHAN: Look , I ca n't run your arrest in CNN , but I guarantee he 's monitoring every law enforcement agency in the world , for what they might be saying about him , if nothing else - he 's got the ability and , we assume , the desire to get you out of there .
NYAH: This does n't seem to be accomplishing much .
ETHAN: Well , I mean it 's not a total loss . It is keeping a very capable thief off the street..
NYAH: Very funny..maybe he has heard and does n't want to know . Maybe he 's lost interest . Her guard , b.g . is handed a note .
GUARD: Your lawyer to see you .
NYAH: What lawyer ?
ETHAN: Well , here we go .
NYAH: Limo 's waiting .
ETHAN: - Ambrose will have counter-surveillance second to no one 's . When and if he contacts you , push this button efore you actually end up under his roof it 'll scramble your transmission to us .
NYAH: When will you be there ?
ETHAN: Before you are .
NYAH: How can you possibly ? I 've got to get ight on the plane . I 'm leaving now .
ETHAN: You do n't trust me .
NYAH: Oh , I do . But as we know I 'm a very poo judge of character .
ETHAN: He 's got you on Qantas flight 2735 . It 's going to be delayed .
NYAH: Yes ?
ETHAN: You 'll be fine . I 'm going to lose you .
NYAH: Ethan , you take care of yourself , I 'll take care of myself because if push comes to shove , I 'm gon na bail - and without giving two week notice .
ETHAN: Well , forewarned is forearmed . And while we 're at it , be especially sensitive to any sudden change in Ambrose 's plans , especially any involving you..
ETHAN'S VOICE: Welcome to Australia , mate .
LUTHER: Thanks - mate . Both men laugh and all three move to
ETHAN: Put in the coordinates and let 's get a visual . The visuals are n't coming up .
LUTHER: The satellite does n't work as fast as I do .
BILLY: Yeah , I 've heard about you , Luther , and I just want to tell you it 's an honor and a pleasure to be working with you blokes , whoaa ! That 's some transponder !
LUTHER: It certainly is . How did we get so lucky ? Ethan pointedly ignore the question .
BILLY: Is it him , then ?
BILLY: Damn . Just when it was about to get interesting .
ETHAN: It 's okay . She scrambled the transmission . Luther , continue feeding the GPS her position .
LUTHER: With what ? This is the only compute that 'll do this .
BILLY: - right . Now there 's a bloke who knows how to deliver a proper welcome . Do n't get me wrong , mate . You were quite hospitable . Is it him , then ?
LUTHER: It is , Billy .
BILLY: Then we got'em !
ETHAN: We do n't know what we 've got because we do n't know what he 's got , where he 's got it or what he 's doing in Sydney with it .
AMBROSE: Not much luggage .
NYAH: I left in a bit of a hurry . I 'm terribly grateful , Sean .
AMBROSE: How grateful ?
NYAH: Well that depends .
AMBROSE: On what .
NYAH: How hard you had to work to get me out of there..how in the world did you ever find me ?
AMBROSE: How I usually find you , Nyah .
NYAH: How do you that .
AMBROSE: Magic
NYAH: Ahh..
WALLIS: No flies on her . No bugs either . She 's clean .
STAMP: All cats are .
NEKHORVICH: therefore in a search for our hero , Bellerophon , we created a monster , Chimera .
BILLY: What you got there , mate ?
ETHAN: A myth..just a mythshould n't you be checking out their countersurveillance ?
BILLY: Well you know his blokes 'll place the OSCOR in his annex , where else if you 're pinpointing transmitters , video signals , covert chip cameras , anything radiating , oscillating..
ETHAN: ..or hard wired..
BILLY: - or hard wired , right . First line of perimeter defence 'll run from the back of the dock to the front of the house . Whatever moves burps or bleep is gon na be picked up to a height of twenty feet . Basically impenetrable , I 'd say .
LUTHER: Ethan , here 's Nekhorvich , and here 's his oss
BILLY: Well do you disagree with that ?
ETHAN: Not at all . But how about going into town and confirming your intuitions on site ?
BILLY: Oh well , if that 's how you feel about it . Billy leaves .
LUTHER: ..then Cambridge..Harvard..entrepreneurial
MCCLOY'S VOICE: We at out state-of-the-art solar powered Biocyte building recognized that eternal vigilance is the price of health.. whethe it 's funding the teaching center at the Royal Prince Edward Hospital , removing aerosol products from the marker o aving the influenza quarantine at Bruny island late last month..at Biocyte you life..is our life 's work..
ETHAN: ..Biocyte workers at Bruny Island .
NYAH: Your room .
AMBROSE: Mmmm .
NYAH: And my room ?
AMBROSE: Thought you could use a little something to wear .
NYAH: No changing room ?
NYAH: You 're not interested in seeing how it looks .
AMBROSE: Oh , I am . Later..
NEKHORVICH: ..therefore in a search for our hero , Bellerophon , we created a monster , Chimera .
ETHAN: Nekhorvich specialized in recombining DNA molecules . In the myth , Bellerophon killed Chimera , a recombinant monster with the head of a lion and the tail of a serpent who
LUTHER: That simple , huh ?
ETHAN: Why not ?
NYAH: Did you say something ?
NYAH: Only because..it 's spring..chalk it up - to spring fever .
AMBROSE: Wo n't do , love . It 's not spring . It 's nearly autumn..You 're in Oz . everything 's upside down and backwards here .
NYAH: Maybe that 's it , then . Everything 's upside down and backwards
ETHAN: Luther..get us everything you can on the outbreak of influenza on Bruny Island last month , including photos of the victims .
LUTHER: Right . I guess there are n't many flu epidemics in the middle of summer .
ETHAN: Yeah ? I 've just rolled up a snowball and tosses it into hell . Ethan stands .
ETHAN'S VOICE: Now we 'll see what chance it has .
AMBROSE: Twenty-four mil..
AMBROSE'S VOICE: Thirty-seven million pounds . That 's a promising bid .
AMBROSE: We 'll need this at the track . Well then . Sorted .
STAMP: Not everything . Why do you think she 's eally here ?
AMBROSE: From her point of view or mine ?
STAMP: Was n't exactly gagging for it when she left you six months ago..The question is , do you trust her ?
AMBROSE: One considers her timing , of course - getting nicked within a week of the plane going down . Suggestive , even borderline suspicious , but hardly conclusive .
STAMP: Well , you 've thorough about it , at any ate .
AMBROSE: Tell me , Hugh . You do n't exactly hang on Nyah 's every word and gesture , do you ? Fairly ratty nail , that .
STAMP: Sean..
AMBROSE: You 're not scrutinizing any casual shrug for some hair-splitting nuance , are you ?
STAMP: Sean , please.. Sean pulls Stamp 's hand closer .
AMBROSE: Suppose she is some sort of Trojan horse sent in by IMF to spy in us , why should I deny myself the pleasure of a ride or two ? Or do n't you think I can learn more from her than she can from me ?
STAMP: I do ! ..
AMBROSE: Now Hugh , you must realize that some of us have the burden of sex to deal with..and my dear chap . I may or may not know why she thinks she 's here , but I 'm willing to take the risk , because Hugh , I am gaging for it..
NYAH: I suppose I did .
NYAH: 'Thief in the Night ? '
AMBROSE: Say no more . I 'm off to grab a drink . Still favor Bellinis ?
A VOICE: Naturally Vain.. It 's Billy passing behind her .
NYAH: Pardon me ?
BILLY: 'Naturally Vain . ' In the fourth . Check her out . She 's due .
ETHAN'S VOICE: You can speak as if I 'm right by you side .
NYAH: Where are you ?
ETHAN'S VOICE: At the mounting enclosure , just off the tracks at two o'clock .
ETHAN: How 's it going ? Everything okay ?
NYAH: Just like old times .
ETHAN: Just like old times ?
NYAH: Just about..
ETHAN: Tell me who you 've run into at Ambrose 's .
NYAH: Near as I can tell , there 's at least a half-dozen other blokes about the place . Maybe more . Hugh Stamp , an old mate of Sean 's , is the only one I recognize , bit of a creep and then some..
ETHAN: We know him . He 's over your left shoulder , looking right at you as you go on..
NYAH: - Michael , his driver 's an Aussie , new to me . Then there 's the blokes in the annex at the back of the house .
ETHAN: Have you met them ?
NYAH: Annex is strictly off limits to me and they never come to the main house , Michael even takes their meals to them all but shoves them under the door .
ETHAN: I 've no doubt .
ETHAN: I 'll be damned . It 's McCloy , the Biocyte
LUTHER: Nekhorvich 's boss ?
ETHAN: Yep .
NYAH: Ambrose has photographs of newspapers with loads of money piled on them thirty- seven million on the London Times . What 's that about ?
ETHAN: Bids from possible Chimera buyers to prove that as of the date on the newspape those bids are back up by earnest money
LUTHER: Looks like Ambrose is showing McCloy how to use a digital camera..
ETHAN: Whatever McCloy 's looking at , he 's not happy about .
LUTHER: Ambrose just pulled the memory card out of the digital camera and put it into an envelope , put it in his inner left jacket pocket
ETHAN: Left jacket pocket ?
LUTHER: Roger that .
ETHAN: Confirm . Left jacket pocket .
LUTHER: Left jacket pocket confirmed .
ETHAN: Nyah , Ambrose is heading back . There 's an enveloped inside
NYAH: his left jacket pocket .
ETHAN: Affirmative .
NYAH: Where do I meet you ?
ETHAN: Betting table twelve off the paddock . Nyah , are you up to this ?
NYAH: I 'll muddle through .
AMBROSE: See anything you like ?
NYAH: Yeah . Naturally vain but they 're about to close the betting table and I have n't a sou..
AMBROSE: Nyah !
ETHAN: Billy , make sure Nyah 's not followed .
BILLY: No worries , mate . She pulls out a fifty-dollar note .
NYAH: Would you mind terribly ? AMBROSE - not at all . But you 'll pay for that and with interest..
AMBROSE: Hold on .
NYAH: To win ?
AMBROSE: What else ?
ETHAN'S VOICE: Luther , smallest digital you got . Ready to transmit . Betting table twelve .
BILLY: Sorry about that , mate , that must 've eally - aggrhh ! ..
STAMP: Say again ?
BILLY: Aggrhh-aggrhh-aggrhh
STAMP: Whatever you 're about in future , watch your step . Never know who you might run into
BILLY: - aggrhh-aggrhh-aggrhh Stamp heads up the men 's room .
ETHAN'S VOICE: How 'd you do ? Do n't turn around . Nyah turns and looks Ethan dead in the eye .
NYAH: I managed .
ETHAN: You noticed . What 're you going to do ? Spank me ?
BILLY'S VOICE: Stamp 's out of the loo .
BILLY'S VOICE: Stamp 's a little shaky , but headed you way , mate .
ETHAN: Copy that . Who do you like ? In the race ?
NYAH: What race are we talking about ?
LUTHER: I 'm booted up . Go , Ethan .
BILLY'S VOICE: He 's heading down the stairs , now..
ETHAN: I want you out of Ambrose 's place .
BILLY'S VOICE: He 's one tier from the bottom .
NYAH: What are you talking about ?
ETHAN: I want you out of there. < /i
NYAH: Why ? What 's happened . What did you see ?
BILLY: Thirty steps.. Slipping card back into envelope .
ETHAN: Nyah , you 've done more than enough . Even the best of snake charmers get bit .
NYAH: Ethan , tell me -
BILLY'S VOICE: Twenty , nineteen..
ETHAN: I want you out of Australia ! ..I do n't know how much more plainly I can put it .
NYAH: How do you suggest I go about it ?
ETHAN: He 's touched your heart . You 're overwhelmed . You need to think it over . You 'll meet him somewhere in a month . If You 're not out in 48 hours I 'm coming in and getting you out . Give me the ea piece .
STAMP: Get your bet down ?
NYAH: Just..
AMBROSE: Your nag is making a run for it on the outside ! Bloody hell , Nyah ! She 's momentarily startled . Then
NYAH: Well , that 's good , is n't ?
ETHAN'S VOICE: Dr. Segi Gradski , Nekhorvich 's colleague and lifelong friend..
ETHAN: Six hours later .
LUTHER: Here 's a victim from the Bruny Island outbreak .
BILLY: Oh , happy day .
ETHAN: Nekhorvich said 'However we travel , I must arrive at my destination within 20 hours hours of departure . '
AMBROSE: To Australia . It 's made so many convicts feel at home . Here 's hoping it does the same for you.. He laughs . She does n't .
NYAH: Sean , there 's something I 've been meaning to talk to you about Is n't going to be easy for me to say .
AMBROSE: Then do n't say it .
NYAH: I do n't know what to do about you , Sean . I 'm more than a bit muddled . I need time .
AMBROSE: To do what ?
NYAH: Sort it all out .
AMBROSE: And you 're going to have time . There 's een a change of plans .
NYAH: A change of plans ?
AMBROSE: Yes . We wo n't be able to have dinne tonight . Something 's come up . I hope you do n't mind .
NYAH: Oh , no , not at all . Maybe just a bit .
AMBROSE: Ulrich will be about . He 'll look afte you .
NYAH: Lovely .
STAMP: I thought you were going to dinner .
AMBROSE: Hugh , take care of the Nekhorvich memory card .
STAMP: Where is it ?
AMBROSE: In the envelope in my pocket . My ight.. jacket..pocket..
ETHAN: Chimera attacking human blood..
BILLY: Ambrose obviously got these from Nekhorvich on the plane .
LUTHER: What manic invents disease like that in the first place ? Why would he do it ?
ETHAN: I do n't know , but Nekhorvich was not a manic . Get me a twenty on Nyah .
LUTHER: She must still be on the property .
ETHAN: I told her to get outta there .
MCCLOY: George . George . George .
MCCLOY: What 's happening here ? You 're dead !
NEKHORVICH: Fatigued , certainly . But dead is a little extreme . On the other hand , when me dea Gradski had your pulse and blood pressure he has less than ten hours to live .
MCCLOY: It was in the bloody papers , on the telly..what 's this about Gradski ?
NYAH: International , please . I 'd like to make a
OPERATOR: Where to ?
NYAH: Where is next available flight going ? The operator answers .
ETHAN: Easy , easy , easy , shhh !
NYAH: Oh Ethan ! .. She throws her arms around him .
ETHAN: Are you okay ?
NYAH: I am now . Get me out of here . Just get me out of here .
ETHAN: It 's going to be okay . He holds her .
NEKHORVICH: No use , my friend . The medical staff wants no part of this . Doctors do n't fancy the idea of dying any more than anybody else .
MCCLOY: How could I possibly be infected ? Nekhorvich shrugs .
NEKHORVICH: That 's exactly what Gradski said - 27
MCCLOY: You have Bellerophon .
NEKHORVICH: Do I ?
MCCLOY: You took it ! All of it ! And what if I need it ?
NEKHORVICH: 'If ? ' My , my , mythe five hundred people on Bruny Island that you
MCCLOY: Oh , please ! How was I to know they had to e treated with Bellerophon within twenty hours ?
NEKHORVICH: By asking me .
MCCLOY: You still do n't get it , do you ? You want to make an omelet , you break a few eggs - i > I needed to know just how bad the disease
NEKHORVICH: You wanted the disease in order to peddle the cure .
NEKHORVICH: You know , I think it 's a little late fo that . Do give my regards to Gradski if you see him .
NYAH: Ethan , you know what frightens me most when I 'm with him ? ..the thought of neve seeing you..how are we getting out of here ?
ETHAN: Nyah , it 's very important not do anything to alarm Ambrose..
NYAH: What ? You told me to get out of here . I thought you were here to collect me . I was so relieved .
ETHAN: No time to explain . You 've done well , and we 're so close . So close . It 's critical that you do whatever Ambrose asks . Do n't worry - it 'll be over soon.. That 's a promise.. Come on , now off you go !
LUTHER: So Ambrose has Bellerophon and McCloy 's got Chimera .
BILLY: There guys are walking around with different halves of the same dollar bill ?
ETHAN: Ambrose got Bellerophon from Nekhorvich on the plane , but he did n't get the Chimera virus .
LUTHER: Yeah . Why else would he come back to Australia ? If he had them both , he could sell them anywhere .
ETHAN: I kill Chimera at Biocyte and he 's sitting on a cure without a disease .
LUTHER: You 've got the voice print , I 'll get us in..
STAMP: You were right . Hunt stung McCloy tonight . He knows . They 'll be going into Biocyte
AMBROSE: Good..then we go where he 'll be , do n't we ? Well done , Hugh . Well done .
BILLY: You 're home , guv'ner . Home.. It 's taking time to register . Then
MCCLOY: - where 's George . My regular driver . Where is he ?
BILLY: Took ill , guv ' . Touch of the flu . They say it 's going around . Nasty business . Mind you do n't catch a chill now .
ETHAN: Luther , do you have the building up and unning ?
LUTHER: Sorry , that it a Biocyte facility , thei storage structure..
ETHAN: Nyah still on the property ?
BILLY: She has n't left it . Then
LUTHER: Okay , here you go -
ETHAN: Let 's start from the inside out .
LUTHER: All storage and production of Chimera is done here , in this lab on the forty-second floor , the heart of the building .
LUTHER'S VOICE: Chimera itself is kept in two places in production vials in an incubation room and housed in a small airtight chamber - inside three injection guns .
BILLY'S VOICE: Mate , you kill it in both places , we 're laughin ' and we go home .
ETHAN: Now how to get in there .
LUTHER: No garage entrance . Lobby 's protected by five guards on rotating patrol .
AMBROSE: If you look at Hunt 's operational history , he invariably favors misdirection and deception . For a start he wo n't go into Biocyte from the ground where he has to risk confrontation with security .
ETHAN: Not going in from the ground . Show me the atrium .
LUTHER'S VOICE: The atrium ? One of a kind . Runs down the center of the building . Provides 24-hou natural light via mirrors and daylight storage cells . Optimal growing conditions for the virus . Ends in a glass floor which doubles as part of the lab 's ceiling .
LUTHER: Hey , atrium roof closes at sundown .
LUTHER'S VOICE: And if the louvers are open for more than thirty seconds at night , the Civil Emergency alarms are tipped . Those even I ca n't stop . Thirty seconds total to get you in and the cable out .
ETHAN: Security ?
LUTHER: Thirty-second opening in the roof and a 250-foot drop .
ETHAN: I 'm not waiting 48 hours . When we 're done at Biocyte , if she 's not out of Ambrose 's , I 'm going in and getting her out .
AMBROSE: No , Hunt will prefer to engage in some sort of acrobatic insanity to ente Biocyte somewhere through the atrium where security is minimal..
BILLY: Package away in five..four..three.. two..one
LUTHER: I 'm not ready !
ETHAN: I 'm gone.. Ethan plummets towards the atrium .
LUTHER: C'mon ! C'mon ! C'mon !
LUTHER'S VOICE: ..nineteen..eighteen..seventeen
ETHAN: Luther , I 'm looking at security .
LUTHER: Oh . Uh . Commencing diversion . Alarm in cosmetics .
LUTHER'S VOICE: Got ta get that cable out .
GUARD: Right . Then I guess I 'll have to trot off to see who 's pinching eyeliner , wo n't I. I 'll even check the stairwell on the way .
BILLY: Retracting cable .
LUTHER'S VOICE: Three..two..one..
BILLY'S VOICE: Cable 's clear .
LUTHER: Transponder activated..Reading package and Cable is clean . He 's on his way . Staring at the buildings control panels .
LUTHER: Ethan , the generators are about to go active . We 'll be out of contact for eleven minutes .
AMBROSE'S VOICE: The frequency of the generators operate to our advantage - cutting radio communication from his team for the next eleven minutes..
STAMP: Not exactly , mate .
LUTHER: Billy . I think we got a problem . Nyah 's on the wing . Up early . Billy , do you copy ?
BILLY: Exactly where is she ?
LUTHER: ..in the building
BILLY'S VOICE: Say again . Sounds like you 're saying 'she 's in the building . '
LUTHER: I am . She is .
AMBROSE'S VOICE: Ethan does it the hard way to avoid confrontation . Neutralizing security guards is simply too distasteful to him..
BILLY: Right . Well , then . She 's not likely to e alone . is she ?
LUTHER'S VOICE: The question Is 'how many of 'em ? ' I ca n't get thru to Ethan . Not 'til the generators go off .
BILLY: When 's that ?
LUTHER'S VOICE: Not for another eight and a half minutes .
MCCLOY'S VOICE: John C. McCloy..
LUTHER: It looks like Nyah 's headed toward an elevator .
AMBROSE'S VOICE: If Hunt actually manages to squeak thru the atrium he 's liable to make it to Chimera before we will..
LUTHER: She 's in the elevator heading toward Ethan .
BILLY'S VOICE: How much longer before you can reach him ?
LUTHER: Five and a half minutes . He 's breached the hot zone..
AMBROSE'S VOICE: On the other hand we know where Hunt will e and he does n't know we 're coming..
COMPUTER VOICE: Alert . Chimera-working-seed-stock-pH-and- temperature-level-outside-optimal range .
BILLY'S VOICE: How 're we doin ' , then ?
LUTHER: He should 've have killed the virus in the incubation area..Nyah 's exited the elevator on the same level as the lab .
BILLY'S VOICE: What can we do ' mate ?
LUTHER: Hope he kills all the bugs before the yellow dot gets to the red one .
LUTHER'S VOICE: He 's still got three injection guns in the test lab..They 're loaded with doses of Chimera which he 'll destroy by firing into a hyper-thermal chamber .
LUTHER: - twenty-seven , twenty-six , twenty-five , come on , Ethan we 're almost there ! I-I 'm off sensitive for this..
LUTHER: Oh - oh - oh -
AMBROSE: Get it .
ETHAN: And you could n't walk to tell me about it .
AMBROSE: Hold your fire , dammit !
ETHAN: Fight a bit of a cold..
AMBROSE: And you 're happy about that ?
ETHAN: Beats fighting the flu , I 'm here to tell you .
AMBROSE: You know , that was the hardest part of having to portray you . Grinning like an idiot every fifteen minutes .
ETHAN: I would 've thought the hardest part was exercising restraint . Curbing that pressing need of your to get your gun off . You were in such a hurry to knock off that 747 , you never figured out where the virus really was .
AMBROSE: I knew where it was .
ETHAN: Oh . then you knew the only way could smuggle the live virus to the CDC scientists in Atlanta was by injecting himself and using his own bloodstream as a Petri dish , doing it inside of twenty hours so he could take the anti-virus and still have it be effective . You knew that while you were knocking him off and destroying the very thing you came for .
AMBROSE: Stop ! Put a sock in it ! Hit that bloody gun and you 'll spray the bloody virus all over the place !
ETHAN: There it is , guys , the last of it .
AMBROSE: Yep . You 've provided us with a golden opportunity to have both the bug and the ug killer .
ETHAN: What was the top bid ?
AMBROSE: Why , you going to make me a better offer ?
ETHAN: Than thirty-seven million pounds ? Not eally .
AMBROSE: Somebody 's been slipping you our mail . Come on out here , you bad girl .
ETHAN: She does n't belong here , Sean . Let her go .
AMBROSE: She would n't be here if it was n't fo you , Hunt . from this moment you 're esponsible for what happens to her , and if you 're looking out for her well-being , I suggest you advise her to pick up the gun and bring it to me . Ball 's in you court , Hunt . What 've you got to say ? Nyah 's waiting for your answer . A pregnant pause .
LUTHER'S VOICE: Ethan , Nyah 's in the building ! Do you copy ?
AMBROSE: Oh , Hunt , please ! One ca n't hold Nyah esponsible for her actions..
ETHAN: In other words , you 're calling her a flake .
AMBROSE: You know women , mate . Like monkeys , they are . Wo n't let go of one branch til they 've got a grip on the nextget it , Nyah . I 'll cover you . Ambrose cocks his weapon . AMBROSE I 'm waiting .
NYAH: This is n't exactly working out the way you thought it would , Ethan . Sorry .
AMBROSE: You..bitch ! She 's been laughing away with Ethan
NYAH: You 're not going to shoot , Sean . Not this bitch . She 's worth thirty-seven million pounds .
ETHAN: What did you think you were doing !
NYAH: I was n't thinking ! Just..trying to keep you from getting hurt , that 's all . This hits Ethan with the force of a blow .
ETHAN: - you who do n't have a conscience .
NYAH: I guess I lied..You ca n't get both of us out of here , can you ?
ETHAN: No .
NYAH: Then you 'll have to kill me before it 's too late . Before I start killing people .
ETHAN: No .
NYAH: I 'm infected with Chimera . You know you do n't have a choice . Just do it now . She puts Ethan 's gun to her forehead . NYAH For god 's sake , get it over with .
ETHAN: We 've got 19 hours and 57 minutes before you start killing anybody . I 'll get Bellerophon into your system by then . Just stay alive . I 'm not gon na lose you .
SWANBECK: 'Dreaming of Birds and Flying Fox , ' 'Bushfire Dreaming , ' 'Wind Dreaming , ' oddly appropriate -
ETHAN: Not yet . We did manage to pull any sensitive equipment and material out of our safehouse wreckage .
SWANBECK: We could lock down passport control and all ports of authority , but that wo n't stop Ambrose , and beyond him , we do n't know who else we 're looking for all terrorist bank accounts of which we 're aware are stable . No deposits , no withdrawals . Therefore no suspects .
ETHAN: We think we 've got our finger on the uyer .
SWANBECK: Do you ? Even assuming you 're able to prevent Ambrose selling Chimera , you 've now got an additional problem . You destroyed all of Chimera at Biocyte . If Ambrose is going to sell Chimera now , he 'll have to do it by taking a pint or so of Miss Hall 's blood to market .
ETHAN: Yes , I believe that 's right .
SWANBECK: But that leaves another seven or eight pints of Chimera .
ETHAN: You mean that leaves Miss Hall .
SWANBECK: Yes , I believe that 's right . Now my understanding is that 20 hours afte exposure , the victim becomes infectious . Highly infectious .
ETHAN: She sacrificed herself..
SWANBECK: Brave girl . If you can get hold of Bellerophon with the time limit , you may spare her the ultimate sacrifice . But in either case you 've got less than nine hours to kill her or cure her . After that it 's out of our hands and a matter of worldwide material law . And Hunt . Howeve you obtain it , we want you to preserve a sample of Chimera . Bring it back alive . Ethan 's staring at Swanbeck .
ETHAN: Are n't you even curious ? About why she did it ?
SWANBECK: No . I ca n't afford to be curious . And neither can you , Hunt..
AMBROSE: Feel like pleading for your life ?
NYAH: Not as much as you feel like hearing it .
AMBROSE: God damn it , Nyah ! Why did you do it ? Why did you save that bastard ?
NYAH: If it 'll make you feel any better I wo n't do it again .
AMBROSE: If it 'll make you feel any better , you 're going to take a lot of Aussies with you and make me a lot of money .
NYAH: What are you talking about ?
AMBROSE: In just a few hours you can be assured of going down in history as the typhoid Mary of Oz . G'day .
ETHAN: Luther ? ..Luther .
LUTHER: Ethan , I keep telling you there 's not a chance of locating Nyah til I access the satellite and there 's not a chance of doing that til I get this thing booted up
ETHAN: Ninety-seven minutes , twenty-seven seconds .
BILLY: Before we kill her or cure her..
LUTHER: Right .
ETHAN: Wrong . All we 've got to worry about is Ambrose . Nyah will take care of Nyah .
BILLY: What are you talking about ?
ETHAN: Unless we dose her with Bellerophon on the next ninety-seven minutes , Nyah will kill herself . So , first things , first . Swanbeck said there 's no cash movement from any monitored terrorist accounts .
ETHAN'S VOICE: Confirms what Ambrose is gon na do -
BILLY'S VOICE: Ethan 's out from under the bridge and on the south-east face..
ETHAN: Copy that .
BILLY'S VOICE: You all right , mate ? From here it looks like very security . What 's it look like like from there ?
ETHAN: Risky . He 's over the top and moves swiftly to cover .
CHEMIST: It 's a DNA match . The blood 's loaded with i > Chimera. < /i
MCCLOY: Well , then . You 've got both the virus and
AMBROSE: Not exactly . Wallis ?
WALLIS: More like two-two point two million .
AMBROSE: In any case we do n't want your cash .
MCCLOY: Then what do you want ? Ambrose picks up a mobile phone and dials .
AMBROSE: Stock , Mr. McCloy . Stock options , to be a little more precise.. - cut her loose..right in the center of town..the more crowded the better.. How quickly can you manufacture more of the antivirus .
LUTHER'S VOICE: Ethan , just picked up an Ambrose call - Nyah 's been dropped off . I think she 's alive .
ETHAN: Where is she ?
LUTHER: Somewhere in Sydney .
LUTHER'S VOICE: Ethan ? Do you copy ?
ETHAN'S VOICE: 'Somewhere in Sydney ? ' Care to harden the target ?
LUTHER'S VOICE: Ca n't . Until I can get the GPS up on ou computer..it 's still down..
ETHAN: The clock is ticking..
AMBROSE: Good . Biocyte stock is just a week or two away from going through the roof .
MCCLOY: What are you talking about ?
AMBROSE: An outbreak of Chimera. < /i
MCCLOY: Where ?
AMBROSE: In downtown Sydney for a start . McCloy is stunned . AMBROSE You create the supply , Mr. McCloy , we 've just created the demand . Three million people in Sydney and 17 million people in Australia are going to need Bellerophen within a matter of days..not to mention the rest of the world..
WALLIS: Ninety-three point four million .
AMBROSE: Which means , Mr. McCloy , we have to get our hands on four hundred and eighty thousand options . We 'll borrow you thirty million to buy those options . You stock 's never sold above thirty-one dollars a share . We 'll agree to buy at fifty .
MCCLOY: Outrageous . I wo n't let you take control of my company .
AMBROSE: Sit down . You 'll be a billionaire . Bette than being broke . I 've got terrorists and other pharmaceutical companies standing in line . Ball 's in your court , Mr. McCloy .
MCCLOY: Yes , start the transfer . The accountant begins working on his laptop .
AMBROSE: Follow it . Let me know .
ETHAN: You broke our deal .
STAMP: You 're too trusting . Raise your hands slowly .
AMBROSE: Keep it going .
STAMP'S VOICE: Sean , this rat 's reached the end of the maze .
AMBROSE: Is he alive ?
STAMP'S VOICE: More or less .
AMBROSE: Bring him to me .
BILLY: We 're due to take off .
LUTHER: Not for seven more minutes .
WALLIS: Sean . Transfer complete .
MCCLOY: What exactly do you intend to do with him ?
LUTHER: Ethan ? Ethan ? Do you copy ?
ETHAN: Well , mate , maybe this is one of those times we should n't follow orders .
AMBROSE: What have you got to say for yourself . Hunt ? Any last words ?
STAMP: Afraid he 's got no choice . I believe I oke his jaw .
AMBROSE: Hugh , I 'm impressed..
MCCLOY: What do you intend to do ?
AMBROSE: You need n't watch .
BILLY: Man at your six .
ETHAN: The field of fire is too heavy . Back off and pinpoint their positions .
AMBROSE: Hunt 's heading for the bridge . Coming in at twelve o'clock high .
ETHAN: Clear that bridge for me .
LUTHER' VOICE: Roger that .
BILLY'S VOICE: They 're tracking you on the left , Ethan . Prepare for some fire .
GPS COMPUTER: The target is located .
LUTHER: Ethan , the computer 's up . I 've got Nyah . She 's moved out of the city .
ETHAN: Luther , say again .
LUTHER: She 's on the North Head Bluff - approaching the cliffs . One klick away .
ETHAN: Copy . She 's only got twenty-eight minutes left . Track ahead and pick her up .
LUTHER: We wo n't be able to cover you .
ETHAN: You 're breaking up . Track ahead and pick he up . You 've got me on GPS . Bring her to me . Ethan pulls out and throws away the earpiece .
LUTHER: Billy , North Head . Haul ass .
WALLIS: Get him .
ULRICH: I ca n't get a good shot .
WALLIS: Shut up . I know what I 'm doing .
LUTHER: Range is two kay .
BILLY: I hope there 's a place to land .
LUTHER: We 're down to seven minutes 23 seconds..
LUTHER'S VOICE: Ethan , we 've got her . Tracking to you now . We 're reading 5 minutes 19 seconds .
LUTHER: Bearing two one zero . About 3 klicks . Ethan , we 're moments away..
AMBROSE: Go ahead . Use it Hunt . It 's not a bad way to go . A lot better than the way that itch is going to die .
SWANBECK: Sorry , Ethan . I do n't quite know where to egin . Any suggestions ?
ETHAN: You 'd like me to conduct my own debriefing .
SWANBECK: Why not ? You 've done just about everything else on this operation .
ETHAN: I 'd thank you but I 'm not sure that was a compliment .
SWANBECK: Of course it was . Anyone whose operations equires the level of disinformation that yours do , is bound to get a little flak here and there . You try flogging the stories on CNN I 've had to come up with about what 's been going on around here the last few days . At any rate , it 's been most instructive what they 'll swallow , or what they 'll broadcast with a straight face . Miss Hall 's blood , it appears , has absolutely no elements of the Chimera virus . Not even antibodies .
ETHAN: Yes , I gathered as much .
SWANBECK: And the only other remaining sample was in the canister you recover from Ambrose .
ETHAN: Yes .
SWANBECK: And that appears to have been destroyed . It also contained the anti-virus , Bellerophon .
ETHAN: Well , Bellerophon , it turns out , was only eally effective against Chimera .
SWANBECK: But you were under specific instructions to bring back a living sample of the Chimera virus . I 'd be very interested to know how , after you 'd managed its recovery intact , it subsequently got destroyed .
ETHAN: By fire . That 's the best way , really .
SWANBECK: So you did n't fail mission , you simply changed it . Ethan does n't respond . SWANBECK It 's no longer enough for you to execute and implement IMF policy , you now wish to go in the business of creating it ?
ETHAN: No , I do n't . But in this case -
SWANBECK: In this case , it was n't a bad idea . In face , it was a pretty damn good idea . Just do n't make a habit of it . And , as fo Ms. Hall , in light of her efforts , he criminal records will certainly be expunged . I 'm assuming you approve .
ETHAN: I do .
SWANBECK: Where is she now , by the way ? Do you know ?
ETHAN: I do n't . No exactly .
SWANBECK: Well , Hunt , what are your plans ?
ETHAN: Not sure . Some sort of vacation . I 'll let you know where I 'm going .
SWANBECK: Oh , you do n't have to do that . Would n't e a vacation if you did .
SKY NEWSCASTER: This incident in the wake of rumors suddenly surfacing about Mr. McCloy and Biocyte 's financial difficulties including criminal allegations of inside trading , embezzlement , conspiracy to commit fraud , and stock parking have , understandably , sent stock prices of the pharmaceutical company plummeting .
LUTHER: So what did he say ?
ETHAN: Good job . And thanks .
BILLY: That 's it ? That 's it ? That 's it ?
LUTHER: And the check 's in the mall .
BILLY: Right . Just remember , mates . Billy Baird 's the name . Anything you need to get , move or watch , I 'm your man .
LUTHER: Always nice hearing from you man . Stay in touch..
NYAH: Do you know me ?
ETHAN: No . Should I ?
NYAH: No . You just looked as if you did .
ETHAN: No
NYAH: Oh . Well..
ETHAN: Let 's get lost .
PHIL: T minus ten , nine , eight , start ignition sequence , five , four , three , two , one , ignition Liftoff !
CHILDREN: My turn ! My turn ! No , I was next ! No , me ! Uncle Phil , Uncle Phil , can I do one ? I want to do one !
PHIL: Guys , guys , please ! This is risky stuff here . And I 'm a highly trained professional .
WILLIS: It 'll take us six months just to get to Mars . Another year on the surface , then six months back . That 's two years
PRETTY GIRL: Nice try , Nick .
KIROV: Hey , Woody , our Mars One crew wo n't e heading back to Earth till ten days after you guys land at our base camp with Mars Two . That 's a pretty good long rendezvous .
WOODY: What are you suggesting , Sergei ?
KIROV: Maybe you should bring a baseball at . Yes ? American baseball ? Our two crews could have ourselves a little Solar System Series .
WOODY: Please . Half you guys are foreigners . We 'd crush you .
KIROV: No , no , we have equal crews . Three men , one woman . Same handicap .
WOODY: Easy now , you 're talking about my wife . And Terri just happens to be one helluva shortstop .
TERRI: Fast pitch , no steals , batter calls his own strikes . Thousand bucks make it interesting ?
COTE: Eh bien . Winner take all .
TERRI: Good . Bring some balls .
WOODY: You wan na know the sad part ? Technically I outrank her . But if we want any peace at all on Mars Two , I 'm gon na be saying a lot of `` Yes , dears . '' The others laugh .
1ST WIFE: just not sure how I feel about NASA allowing couples to go on this type of mission together .
TERRI: All the research shows that marriage will provide stability on these long duration trips .
2ND WIFE: Then they have n't studied some of the couples I 've known .
3RD WIFE: Anybody seen Jim McConnell ?
4TH WIFE: I do n't think he 's coming .
1ST WIFE: God , that poor man . How 's he doing ?
2ND WIFE: Totally losing it , from what I hear . Ca n't sleep , ca n't eat . Visits he grave almost every day . They say he could lose mission status .
3RD WIFE: Oh , that 's so sad . That is just so tragic . You go to a routine physical one day , and wham .
4TH WIFE: After all those years of training , too . It was their whole dream .
1ST WIFE: Must be a pretty funny feeling fo Luke Graham . Y'know ? Now he 's gon na e in the history books . First man on Mars
DEBRA: He 's not coming , Luke .
LUKE: Jim deserves this , too . All his friends are here . And it 's my last night .
DEBRA: Your last night with us , too .
LUKE: I love you , Deb .
DEBRA: I love you too , baby . But maybe you should spend some time with Bobby .
LUKE: Yeah . I will . Where is he ?
DEBRA: Up in his fort .
WILLIS: Deep space is so lonesome . So cold . But I guess I 'll have my memories to keep me warm
BOBBY: Who 's gon na read to me now , at edtime ? Luke is surprised by the question . A pause .
LUKE: Mommy will .
BOBBY: I like when you do it . Now we 're never gon na finish our book .
LUKE: Well , I 'll tell you what . I 've been thinking about that . And what I thought was how 'bout if I bring along my own copy ? Then every night , wherever I am , I 'll read a little bit more of it . And I 'll know that you and Mommy , wherever you are , you 're reading it too . That way , it 'll feel like we 're still reading it together . 'Cause I do n't know about you , but I 'm pretty anxious to find out how 'ol Ben Gunn got marooned on that island . What d'you say ?
DEBRA: We were afraid you would n't come .
MCCONNELL: I caught a whiff of your barbecue . After that I was helpless .
DEBRA: All the way out in Galveston ?
MCCONNELL: Something like that . It 's his night , Deb . I did n't want to spoil it .
DEBRA: Spoil it ? He 's been going crazy looking for you .
LUKE: C'mon . A whole lot of folks here are gon na be mighty glad to see you .
WOODY: I wish we were all going . Together .
LUKE: Then you 've got a short memory . Think ack to how we were by the second week of lunar training .
WOODY: Oh , you 're not gon na bring that up again
LUKE: I 'm trying to remember , let 's see , which one of us scored the lowest anking up there ?
WOODY: You just ca n't let that go
LUKE: Oh , man , three commanders , on the same ship ? If they sent us off to Mars together , there would n't be enough fuel to lift all those egos .
WOODY: Bullshit , we would 've made a great crew .
MCCONNELL: That was never gon na happen . I was always teamed with Maggie , and we were mostly chalkboard jockies . You know ? Systems . Payloads
LUKE: Listen to him . Mr. Cover-of-Time Magazine !
WOODY: Yeah , who landed the crippled Block II Shuttle ?
LUKE: Yeah , and who scored highest on the lunar rankings ?
WOODY: Let it go , Luke .
MCCONNELL: Sure , I made a little noise . But putting the first footprints on Mars ? Nah . That 's for guys who wrote their Ph.D. thesis on how to colonize the place . And guys who read too much science fiction as a kid and still wear little Flash Gordon rocketships around their necks .
WOODY: You read the same damn science fiction ooks that I did ! You 're just not man enough to wear jewelry !
MCCONNELL: God , she would 've loved to see you two clowns . Just one more time .
LUKE: Hey , Woodrow , is n't it about time you donated this thing to a museum ?
WOODY: Internal combustion , boys . Accept no substitutes . Luke laughs . Woody looks at McConnell .
MCCONNELL: I 'm okay . Really . Thanks . Woody reaches out to shake Luke 's hand .
WOODY: See you when I get to Mars , Luke . Do n't solve all the mysteries of the universe , okay ? Leave a little something for the next guys .
LUKE: I 'll see what I can do . Just make sure you bring some fresh beer .
WOODY: You got it .
LUKE: Should 've been your mission , Jim . Yours and Maggie 's .
MCCONNELL: That 's all over now .
LUKE: If Maggie had n't gotten sick if you had n't pulled yourself out of the rotation to take care of her
MCCONNELL: I know that , Luke . You do n't have to say it Mars is yours now . Go get it .
LUKE: Take care of yourself .
MCCONNELL: Yeah . You too .
COTE: Luke , you read me ?
LUKE: Yeah , Renee .
COTE: Luke , I just got ARES-8 on line and Well , we think you 're gon na wan na see this for yourself .
LUKE: Copy that . As Luke turns away , headed for the rove
LUKE: What the hell is that ?
COTE: No idea , boss .
LUKE: Where is it ?
WILLIS: You do n't wan na know .
LUKE: C'mon , what 's so funny ? Gim me the coordinates .
COTE: Latitude 41 degrees north , longitude 9 degrees west .
LUKE: The Plains of Cydonia . So ? Oh no . You 're not telling me
COTE: Oui . Exactement ! It 's Kirov 's fault , he picked today 's sector .
KIROV: Hey , c'mon ! We 've got a scientific duty to check that thing out .
LUKE: Great . That 's great . The first anomaly we hit , and it 's got ta be in the one place guaranteed to make NASA look idiculous You know how many books have been written about that damned mountain ?
COTE: The Egyptians put it there .
KIROV: No , the Amazons .
WILLIS: No , it was little green men !
LUKE: And all because a couple of lousy impact craters happen to look like eye sockets . If this gets out , we 'll have every UFO kook on Earth spouting off on the six o'clock news C'mon , people , gim me a read here . Is that a cinder cone ?
KIROV: Nah , too smooth . Too angular . Volcanic upwelling ?
COTE: No fissures . No caldera .
LUKE: It 's an upwelling , for sure . But maybe not volcanic
COTE: This far south ?
WILLIS: Impossible . You ca n't have ice at this latitude . Not unless
LUKE: How far away is it ?
KIROV: Sixteen kilometers northeast . Take us twenty minutes to get there .
LUKE: Let 's send a packet to Micker . Then we 'll go check it out .
LUKE: This is a truly anomalous formation . Looks like nothing we 've seen so far . The structure appears to be crystalline , at least from the angle displayed by ARES-8
LUKE: Anyway , we'are going out to take a closer look at it , try to get an idea of its composition . By the time you receive this , we should be just about on-site .
KIROV: Jesus Christ
LUKE: Anyone else hear that ?
COTE: Yeah . What is it ?
WILLIS: Sounds like our antenna 's out of phase .
LUKE: Can you fix it ?
WILLIS: Hey , skip , I can fix anything .
LUKE: Big talker . Renee , Sergei , let 's eak out the radar , see what this thing 's made of .
BECK: and this is the Mars Mission Control Room , nicknamed `` Micker . '' I understand a comm packet is incoming from Mars One Base Camp , so you may find this interesting .
AMBASSADOR: That man over there . He 's in charge ?
AMBASSADOR: Will he be going to Mars , too ?
BECK: Ah , no . This is as close as he gets .
LUKE: anyway , that 's about it . We 'll send another packet when we get back .
COTE: Je ne sais pas . I I think there 's something wrong with the equipment .
LUKE: What ?
COTE: I mean , it ca n't be right . It says it says there 's metal under there .
LUKE: That does n't make any sense . You 're eading a vein of ore .
COTE: No . It 's under the whole mountain . The deep pulsing tone continues . Luke frowns .
LUKE: Nick , could the problem with the antenna be interfering ?
WILLIS: Could be .
LUKE: Try it closer and up the power . I 'll watch the screen .
MCCONNELL: Ah , we 're all pretty stoked about that formation you spotted , Mars One . The folks in the geology and hydrology back rooms are going ove your images and comparing them to every photomap they 've got .
LUKE: Nick , how we coming on that antenna ?
WILLIS: Goin ' as fast as I can , boss .
KIROV: Hey , Nick . Come show me how stupid I am . I ca n't get this to work .
MCCONNELL: Medical wants me to remind you that you 're three days late on your blood tests . I know they 're a bore , but you 've got to get them done , o else or else I do n't know what . Just do them , okay ?
KIROV: All set here , chief .
LUKE: Okay . Crank up the juice and let 's see what 's in this sucker .
MCCONNELL: I think that 's about it for business . But on a personal note , be advised that , ah , none of you can sing worth a damn . LAUGHTER in the MMCR .
MCCONNELL: Honestly , Luke , if you guys do n't have anything better to do with you time , I can make some suggestions to mission medical . There are worse things than blood tests . LAUGHTER and GROANS from the staff in MMCR .
MCCONNELL: Oh , and I talked to Debra . She and Bobby are doing fine . Said to tell you , they 're , ah , they 're on thei `` third time through the book , page page 125 . '' They send their love and say take care of yourself . Same from us here , buddy . Till next time , then . End of transmission .
WOODY: `` Problem Hatch door malfunction , ackup power fail , manual override fail . Solution Replace circuit eaker 907B . ''
TERRI: Do n't try to change the subject .
WOODY: I 'm not ! We 're talking about you sister 's wedding , right ?
TERRI: Very funny . We 're talking about dancing lessons . Before my sister 's wedding .
WOODY: Honey , do you mind ? I 've got a catastrophic power failure here .
TERRI: Woody , we 're a married couple . Would it kill you to invite me out on the floor once in awhile ?
WOODY: I danced with you at our wedding .
TERRI: I 'm not talking about shuffling you feet around while you grab my butt . I mean real dancing . Cha-cha , rhumba , jitterbug
WOODY: Face it , honey , some couples dance , some go to Mars . That 's life .
TERRI: I 'm serious . We 've got two more months in this training rotation , but just as soon as we get home , we 're starting lessons . If we never dance , people will think there 's something wrong .
WOODY: If they see me dance , they 'll know there 's something wrong .
TERRI: You are such a lug . Overhead , an intercom CRACKLES . We hear PHIL .
PHIL'S VOICE: Cockpit , this is Control .
TERRI: Control , this is Cockpit .
PHIL'S VOICE: Uh , Terri , they want us all back in the Station . Report to Micker .
TERRI: Who says report to Micker ?
PHIL'S VOICE: The little men who live in my head .
WOODY: Phil , c'mon ! We just started this drill .
PHIL: Woody , it was Ray Beck . He told me to round up the team . Now .
BECK: Then , at 1417 , the X-band continuous data stream from Mars went silent . All data med , environmental , everything suddenly stopped . While we were trying to figure out what the hell went wrong , we got a signal from the folks at the Large Array at Soccoro .
MCCONNELL: At the same moment we lost the data stream , they picked up an intense urst of energy from Mars .
WOODY: What do you mean , `` intense '' ?
MCCONNELL: Catastrophic . Looks are exchanged among the Mars Two crew .
TERRI: What about the crew ?
BECK: The level of energy in the pulse did n't seem survivable .
WOODY: What about the REMO ? It went into Mars orbit last week . Maybe that could give us some clue .
MCCONNELL: Good thinking , Woody . That 's just what we tried next . He leans over , punches buttons on a keyboard .
TERRI: Someone 's alive .
MCCONNELL: Yes .
PHIL: How ?
BECK: The message is almost indecipherable . Two teams are still working on it . You better see for yourselves .
TECHNICIAN: Still concentrating on the audio . We managed to bring out a couple more words , but we 've got a long way to go .
WOODY: Show us whatever you 've got .
LUKE: make this quick may be only ch to the site , when we hit us just as we thers are all dead
TECHNICIAN: That 's it .
TERRI: What did Luke mean by a `` low sound ? ''
BECK: If this was a earthquake , as we 're now assuming , there 's usually an auditory component .
WOODY: But that energy pulse they picked up in New Mexico
PHIL: Electromagnetic emission . Not uncommon with large-scale geophysical phenomena .
WOODY: Causing this kind of damage ? I do n't uy it . We 're missing something here .
TERRI: Luke must be in pretty bad shape if he has n't blasted out of there in the Earth Return Vehicle . That thing 's designed so even one crew membe could fly it back to Earth .
MCCONNELL: Even if Luke was in great shape , he could n't get home . That energy pulse would 've fried the ERV 'S computers .
WOODY: Other than the computers , how do we think the ERV fared ?
BECK: Well , so far our modelling says it should be in pretty good shape .
WOODY: Which means it 's gon na be up to us to get new motherboards , drives , and software to Mars . As fast as we can .
BECK: Whoa , slow down . It 's gon na take us weeks just to analyze this data .
MCCONNELL: Right , but meanwhile , we 've got ta be working up a mission plan .
WOODY: Luke needs us now .
BECK: Luke may already be dead . And even if he 's not , it 's doubtful he 's going to be able to transmit again . So we would n't know whether it 's safe to land until you were almost there .
PHIL: What about SIMA ? Terri looks at Phil SIMA ?
WOODY: Good idea Phil . If SIMA tells us Luke has n't survived and it 's not safe to land , we swing around Mars and come right back home .
MCCONNELL: Yes . We can design the mission to have a free return capability . It 's a long trip , but if you do n't land it 's the best option .
BECK: We 're getting ahead of ourselves . You 're forgetting the bigger problem . The orbits are all wrong . Our first decent launch window is almost eight months from now .
MCCONNELL: But we can go earlier and get there faster if we reconfigure the payload for extra fuel . We 've modelled that , Ray . I 've modelled it .
BECK: On paper , yeah . But those stresses have never been tested in space .
MCCONNELL: The ship can take it .
BECK: I was n't thinking of just the ship .
MCCONNELL: I know the protocols for a Mars Recovery Mission better than anybody , ecause I helped design them . And I 'm saying these guys can do it .
WOODY: He 's right , Ray . We 've got a real shot .
BECK: Give me an updated mission plan by 0800 tomorrow . Then I 'll put it in the works .
MCCONNELL: You 'll have it by 0600 .
WOODY: Chief , could I have a word ? Beck looks at him a moment , nods .
WOODY: I 've no longer got the right crew .
BECK: What do you mean ? Bjornstrom can be up here on the next shuttle .
WOODY: Bjornstrom is a geologist . He 's good , ut not for this . My people just lost eight months of training . This is a different mission , with a different objective .
BECK: I have n't been given authorization for a mission yet .
WOODY: But when you are , it ought to be given the best chance for success . I want McConnell to fly right seat . Beck 's expression hardens .
BECK: He 's no longer on mission status .
WOODY: Yeah . Because you washed him out .
BECK: He washed himself out . He only had to pass a few more psych evaluations , ut he refused to take them .
WOODY: Ray , he 's the best pilot I ever saw , and you 've got him benched at a desk .
BECK: Everybody has to pass the psych prelims . No exceptions . Jim knew that .
WOODY: Maggie was his wife . He did n't want to lie on a couch and share her with strangers .
BECK: That was his call . But I had to make one too . It was tough as hell , but I 'd do it again .
WOODY: His wife wasted away in front of his eyes . What was he supposed to do ? Suck it up ? Get with the program ? What was his crime ? That he was upset ? That he cried ?
BECK: I could n't trust him !
WOODY: When Maggie died , yeah , it knocked the shit out of him . It knocked the hell out of all of us . But you know and I know that he 's still the best we 've got . He and Maggie wrote the ook on Mars . He 's got more hours in the sims than the rest of us put together . Ray , we can do this . Give me McConnell as co-pilot , and we will bring Luke home . And that 's a promise . Beck looks back at him , his features taunt .
MCCONNELL: What 's that ?
PHIL: That is the exact chemical composition of my ideal woman .
MCCONNELL: Used to be .
PHIL: Hey ! McConnell grins , snacking on the M & Ms .
MCCONNELL: Now what is it ? Phil looks sadly at his floating model .
PHIL: A frog .
TERRI: I guess now we have our answer to the effects of long-term interplanetary travel on the human mind . The answer is Phil .
MCCONNELL: I 'm gon na get an update on SIMA . It should be just about close enough to start capturing some surface images .
WOODY: Take a look . McConnell pulls himself forward .
MCCONNELL: Dust storm . Southern hemisphere , coming from the east Big fella , too .
WOODY: Headed for Chryse Planitia .
MCCONNELL: Yup . Could get a little hairy just about landing time
WOODY: We 'll have to be ready to move fast . Maybe even advance our ETA . Those things can cover the whole planet , and last up to a year . A beat . They both hope he 's wrong .
MCCONNELL: When does SIMA do her fly-by ?
WOODY: Tomorrow morning , about 0600 . That 's when we find out whether we came all this way for nothing .
MCCONNELL: My money 's on Luke .
PHIL: What brought this on ?
WOODY: Zero-G. My last chance to be graceful . Once we 're in Mars gravity , it 's ack to shuffling my feet and grabbing her butt .
TERRI: I 'll take what I can get .
COMPUTER: Attention . Incoming packet .
MCCONNELL: It 's SIMA .
WOODY: Looks deserted .
PHIL: It 's still standing , though . So is the ERV . And look , there 's the greenhouse .
MCCONNELL: We know Luke survived for at least a few hours . Question is , are there any signs of recent activity ?
PHIL: There .
MCCONNELL: Graves .
PHIL: Hold on . There 's only three . That means
TERRI: Phil
PHIL: It means Luke must still be
TERRI: No . It just means there was nobody left to bury him . This quiets everyone for a long moment .
WOODY: Check the radiation levels .
PHIL: Normal .
WOODY: Go to the disaster site .
MCCONNELL: What 's wrong ?
PHIL: I do n't know . Magnetic interference ?
WOODY: Go to infrared . Phil works the keyboard .
PHIL: Must be a problem with SIMA . I do n't see how an earthquake , six months ago , could give us this kind of distortion .
MCCONNELL: That was no quake . He leans closer , staring intently .
WOODY: Then what the hell was it ?
BECK: We 're going to continue analyzing this data and try to determine what the problem is with those images . Frankly , we 're just as stumped as you guys , but we 'll keep on it . We agree that the evidence of the graves is inconclusive and that a ground search is advisable . Be aware there are little sand storms kicking up near Mars One Base , but the big one you spotted is turning south . It should n't be a factor . Beck takes a breath , smiles .
TERRI: What if you opened up your meal packs and found that , instead of putting in everything but red ones , they 'd made a mistake and put in only red ones ?
PHIL: Hey , that 's a funny notion . And what if in your meal packs , instead of own rice , there were spring-loaded spikes that shot into your eyes ?
TERRI: How did you ever pass the psych evaluation ?
PHIL: When you 're schizophrenic , they take the higher score . He touches the screen to roll the dice .
LUKE: Jim 's first ship was seriously underpowered
WOODY: Maggie was always starstruck
MAGGIE: I 'll get you guys for this .
LUKE: When they met at the Air Force Academy , it was `` love at first flight . ''
WOODY: After that , NASA training was tough . All Jim could think about was exploring a heavenly body . More ribald LAUGHTER , as
LUKE: But Maggie , as you can see , kept him on a short leash . Until
WOODY: Mission accomplished !
LUKE: Today we celebrate a new chapter in their story . And guys , it 's a pretty historic one . Both men raise champagne flutes .
WOODY: Let 's hear it for the newly-announced Captain and Co-Captain of Mars One . To Jim and Maggie !
LUKE: When you guys land , it 'll prove once and for all there 's no intelligent life on Mars .
MAGGIE: Hey , c'mon , what if I 'm right ?
ASSORTED VOICES: Oh no , here we go ! Do n't get he started ! Somebody put on some music !
MAGGIE: It 's our sister planet !
PHIL: Oh brother !
TERRI: Maggie , why does this have to be about us ? Mars is a great opportunity for pure science .
MAGGIE: We 'll do the science . And we 'll do it very well . That 's what we 've trained for . But what if there 's more ? In all our myths , in every human culture , Mars has always held a special attraction . What if that means something ? Only we do n't understand it yet
WOODY: You okay ?
MCCONNELL: Yeah . I 'm good to go .
WOODY: You know what ? She may have been ight . McConnell looks at him .
MCCONNELL: It 's never been out of my mind .
WOODY: Jesus . You realize what this means ?
MCCONNELL: She knew , Woody . She was the only one of us that ever thought there might be something down there .
WOODY: Yeah , and we 're not leaving until we find out Deal ?
MCCONNELL: Range 6783 and closing . 35 minutes till Mars Orbital Capture .
WOODY: Okay , people let 's look sharp . If we overshoot , there 's no coming back .
MCCONNELL: Tie main bus to systems .
TERRI: Charged and on-line
MCCONNELL: Transfer protocol data from EVA station .
PHIL: Transferred . Awaiting track confirmation .
TERRI: What in God 's
WOODY: Micrometeoroids
MCCONNELL: Breach hits in the hull !
PHIL: Outgassing ! Losing pressure !
TERRI: Woody , seal the breech !
WOODY: Kill those alarms !
PHIL: Losing pressure fast ! We 're gon na decompress !
WOODY: Computer , how long until zero atmosphere ?
COMPUTER: Four minutes , nine seconds .
PHIL: If we get below 20 % atmosphere , the power will shut down !
TERRI: Are you sure ?
PHIL: Positive ! A vacuum inside the ship would cause a total electrical failure . The nav computers will fry !
MCCONNELL: We 'll lose all control . We wo n't be able to fire the engines to capture Mars orbit .
PHIL: It 's already starting . The primary L- 1 hub has been smashed . The systems are crashing .
WOODY: Everybody switch to suit oxygen . We eat this in the simulator , we can do it here . Jim , you 've got the ship . I 'm going EVA .
PHIL: Jesus , it 's still bleeding .
TERRI: Keep the pressure on !
COMPUTER: Eighty percent atmosphere
TERRI: Jim , you 've got ta get your spare helmet from storage .
MCCONNELL: No time . Phil , can you keep the nav computers on-line ?
PHIL: I ca n't get this damn machine to re- initialize ! And the automated systems just went down . We ca n't shut down the hab rotation from here .
MCCONNELL: I 'll do it from below .
TERRI: We 're losing pressure . You could embolize .
COMPUTER: Seventy percent atmosphere
PHIL: Jim , I 've got an idea . If you guys can save enough atmosphere , I 'll disconnect the power in the main computer bay , then jump start the systems . I 'll do a hard boot .
MCCONNELL: Has that ever been tested ?
PHIL: Are you kidding ? These machines are much too valuable .
MCCONNELL: Do it .
WOODY: Jim , how we doin ' on the AG ?
MCCONNELL: Just one goddamn second . Come on , c'mon
COMPUTER: Voice print identification .
MCCONNELL: McConnell !
COMPUTER: Accepted . Shutting down artificial gravitational rotation .
MCCONNELL: Hang on ! McConnell grabs onto a counter edge as
COMPUTER: Sixty per cent atmosphere
MCCONNELL: I 've got a better idea . Stay there !
WOODY: Jesus , uh , OK , this is gon na be like searching for a needle in a haystack .
MCCONNELL: Shake out the liquid .
TERRI: Jim , I do n't
MCCONNELL: Shake it out near the hull !
WOODY: C'mon , c'mon , where are you ?
MCCONNELL: Woody , the breech is in sector four ! Sector four , copy that ?
WOODY: Sonofabitch . You never did that in the simulator .
PHIL: Where are you , you little bastard , where are you ?
COMPUTER: Forty percent atmosphere
WOODY: Whoa .
PHIL: Gotcha !
COMPUTER: Thirty percent atmosphere
PHIL: OK OK now
COMPUTER: Twenty percent atmosphere
PHIL: Yes ! Awriiiight ! Had it all the way . Yes !
WOODY: Jim , there 's a lot of scarring I 'd better check for other punctures while I 'm out here .
WOODY: Know what ? You 've got enough left . McConnell looks at him , understands .
TERRI: Piece of cake ?
WOODY: Well . Easier than the cha-cha .
PHIL: I do n't know what you 're getting so cocky about . We scored better times in the sim at least twice .
MCCONNELL: How 's his hand ?
TERRI: Seems OK . Couple of the tendons are going to be a little tight for awhile . Try to close your fingers , Phil , nice and slowly .
PHIL: Well , at least I 'll still be able to drive .
WOODY: OK , we 're ready to light this candle . Go/No Go for braking burn and MOI . Engines ?
MCCONNELL: Go .
WOODY: Systems .
TERRI: Go .
WOODY: Nav .
PHIL: Go .
WOODY: We are Go for the burn . I 'm fueling the engines .
PHIL: Four Three Woody hesitates , then glances at McConnell .
WOODY: Jim ?
MCCONNELL: Let 's go to Mars .
WOODY: What the
MCCONNELL: Shut down engines !
WOODY: Engines negative ! No response ! I 've got no attitude control !
MCCONNELL: Manual separation ! Blow the bolts !
WOODY: Negative ! The CM does n't have enough thrust to correct this rotation !
PHIL: We 're too steep ! Falling into the atmosphere !
WOODY: How much time 've we got ?
PHIL: I do n't know ! Three minutes ? I do n't know !
MCCONNELL: Where 's the REMO ?
PHIL: The Resupply Module ? Why ? That 's not
MCCONNELL: Where is it ? !
PHIL: Uh , it 's close
MCCONNELL: Damn it , how close ? !
PHIL: I-I do n't know . It 'll take time
MCCONNELL: We do n't have time ! Figure it out ! Now !
WOODY: Jim , we 're dead stick , there 's no way to maneuver this ship into a link-up !
MCCONNELL: Not the ship . Just us . We have to go
PHIL: You want us to transfer in suits ?
TERRI: Jesus , Jim if we do n't make it if we miss the REMO
MCCONNELL: There 's no other choice ! Phil , how close ? !
PHIL: One kilometer , that 's the best I can do !
WOODY: Prepare to abandon ship .
WOODY: On my mark , seven percent left thruster . Three , two , one , fire .
TERRI: What 're you looking for ?
PHIL: Earth .
TERRI: Hey . When we get back ? We really will have to try this in the sim . He tries to smile . So does she .
MCCONNELL: How we doin ' on fuel , Woody ?
WOODY: I 'm at fifty percent . But I do n't see the REMO .
WOODY: Jesus . She 's not where I thought she 'd be .
PHIL: We 're going to miss her .
MCCONNELL: What do you think ?
WOODY: We ca n't catch it . Not like this .
MCCONNELL: Use the tether .
WOODY: It 'll be better if I leave you the gun while I run out to the REMO . I 've got enough fuel left for that .
MCCONNELL: You 'll be going too fast .
WOODY: I 'll aim to overshoot , then brake like hell ; arc it in .
WOODY: I 'm out . Coming in hot . Still long . Abandoning the unit . I 'll brake with suit jets .
TERRI: Oh Jesus . Jesus
WOODY: Suit jets gone . But I 'm gon na make contact
MCCONNELL: At what velocity ?
WOODY: Impact 's gon na be a little rough .
MCCONNELL: At what velocity ?
WOODY: Thirty-two .
MCCONNELL: I 'm gon na use the gun to slow you .
WOODY: No ! You slow me and I 'll fall short .
MCCONNELL: It 's too fast , Woody .
WOODY: No choice . I 'll be okay . Here we go
TERRI: Woody ! !
MCCONNELL: Woody , what 's your status ?
WOODY: Uh , well , no suit jets and I 'm still carrying a good deal of velocity .
MCCONNELL: As soon as we get hooked up , I 'll come get you .
WOODY: Uh , I 'd have to say negative on that , Jim .
MCCONNELL: Negative on the transmission ?
WOODY: No , I heard you . Negative on the maneuver . I am not retrievable .
TERRI: Woody , that 's not possible . You 're not going that fast .
WOODY: It comes down to the amount of fuel , honey . The suit jets were designed for attitude control , not travel . Retrieval just wo n't work .
PHIL: It has to work !
WOODY: Hey , believe me , I do n't like it any more than you do .
TERRI: Woody
WOODY: Run the numbers , Jim .
MCCONNELL: I am .
WOODY: Sounds good , Jim .
TERRI: It 's gon na take half an hour to get the REMO reoriented ! Woody 'll be He 'll be in the atmosphere by then !
MCCONNELL: Then we 'll have to get her moving faster .
TERRI: We do n't have time !
WOODY: You listen to Jim , honey . It 's a good plan .
TERRI: No ! We are going to
PHIL: Oh Jesus , look ! The ship ! Phil points . McConnell and Terri look .
MCCONNELL: Look out !
MCCONNELL: Brakes !
MCCONNELL: Okay , let 's get inside ! Phil , start dumping the cargo , or there wo n't be oom for us .
PHIL: But we need those supplies for
MCCONNELL: Dump the cargo . Hang on , Woody !
WOODY: Hey , Beautiful
MCCONNELL: Terri , no !
MCCONNELL: Goddammit , Terri , it wo n't work ! But Terri keeps on going .
TERRI: I 'll tell you what I 'm not doing , Woody . I 'm not going to watch you die .
WOODY: Terri
TERRI: You 'd do the same for me .
MCCONNELL: Get inside . Dump the cargo , then start the systems . Now .
WOODY: No . I would n't come for you . Not if it just was n't possible .
TERRI: I can do it !
WOODY: No , Terri , you ca n't ! You do n't have enough fuel to get me , stop us both , and get us back . Hell , you come any farther and you wo n't have enough to get back yourself . No response from Terri .
MCCONNELL: He 's right , Terri It 's no use . Terri looks at her armpad display .
WOODY: Okay , honey ? You got ta go back now .
TERRI: The hell I do .
WOODY: What are you doing ?
TERRI: I 'm gon na jet a little closer and try again .
WOODY: Terri , you spend any fuel getting closer , you wo n't get back , and if anyone tries to get you , they 'll die too . No response from Terri .
WOODY: Honey , please go back . Go back and help everyone get down to the surface .
TERRI: I am not losing you .
WOODY: I ca n't let you do it . I ca n't . I 'm sorry .
TERRI: Woody , nooooooo ! ! !
MCCONNELL: Come back , Terri .
NEW CAPCOM: Okay , they 're Go for the burn and MOI . Should be initiating the burn just about now .
NEW CAPCOM: Ray ? We 've got some new data , just coming in .
BECK: Data ?
NEW CAPCOM: Yes sir . Telemetry reports the REMO has left its orbit and reached the Martian surface .
BECK: Crashed ?
NEW CAPCOM: No sir . Under power .
BECK: When ?
NEW CAPCOM: Sixty-three minutes after Mars Recovery went off-line . Sir , the graph reads like a controlled descent . But that does n't make any
BECK: They used the REMO as a lander .
MCCONNELL: Better ?
PHIL: Damn right .
MCCONNELL: Terri , let 's see if that oxygen still is operational . Phil , you bette check out the ERV . I 'll take the Hab . If you find Luke 's
PHIL: I 've got ERV access . I 'm going in . Terri , you okay ?
TERRI: Yeah . This is gon na take awhile to get back to 100 % capacity .
PHIL: ERV appears structurally intact . Computers are fried , just as we thought .
TERRI: Copy that . I 've got busted filters here , clogged intakes . Helluva cleanup job , but so far no major damage .
PHIL: What is it ? There 's no answer . He rises .
TERRI: Jim ?
MCCONNELL: Luke , it 's me ! Jim McConnell !
LUKE: You 're not here !
MCCONNELL: Luke , it 's Jim !
LUKE: No , no , you 're not you ca n't be here .
MCCONNELL: Your wife is Debra ! Your son is Bobby ! You were reading Treasure Island with him !
LUKE: Phil Terri Luke looks with incomprehension at McConnell .
MCCONNELL: He did n't make it Luke .
LUKE: Oh no .
MCCONNELL: Luke , what happened here ? A flash of fear in Luke 's eyes .
LUKE: We fired the radar . It came . They all died .
MCCONNELL: What came ?
LUKE: They all died , but I was spared . Why ? Had to be for a reason . Then , all of a sudden , I knew why I was spared . His voice drops to a conspiratorial whisper .
MCCONNELL: Luke , we still do n't understand .
LUKE: Come . Comecomecome .
PHIL: Is it just me ? Or is he about two mealpacks short of a picnic ?
TERRI: Long term exposure to low gravity can have an adverse impact on the ain . He could be suffering from a form of asphyxia .
MCCONNELL: Or maybe his whole crew died and he 's been marooned alone on Mars . Let 's give him time to adjust .
PHIL: Greatgreatgreat .
LUKE: So let me be sure I understand this . Your ship blew up , with all its supplies . Then you emptied the cargo out of the REMO , and it was totalled on landing . You 've got no food , no water , no spare oxygen , nothing but what I see here ?
MCCONNELL: That kind .
PHIL: Check it out . New nav boards for the ERV . I got four round-trip tickets , aby , right in here .
LUKE: Four .
TERRI: Thanks , Luke .
LUKE: When there 's time , we 'll talk .
MCCONNELL: Has it been blowing like this for a while ? We saw a big storm from space . But Micker said it was turning south .
LUKE: If it holds course .
MCCONNELL: This whatever it was this force . You say it came directly out of the top of the mountain ?
LUKE: You do n't believe me . That 's okay . But I 'm not crazy , Jim .
MCCONNELL: What did you mean by its `` secret ? '' What secret ?
LUKE: You better see for yourselves .
LUKE: See , where they made their mistake was , they must 've planned for it to e visible from Earth
MCCONNELL: Who 's `` they '' ?
LUKE: Do n't you understand ? Hundreds of millions of years have gone by . You 've got erosion , sand storms , lava flows , meteor impacts hell , in that much time , the whole surface would 've changed . So no wonder we never saw it before . Well , I mean , we saw it , ut not like they meant us too . Too much dirt on it .
TERRI: Saw what ?
LUKE: This . On the computer screen they 're looking at
PHIL: Jesus
TERRI: What is that ?
LUKE: I do n't know . But whatever it is , somebody built it . And not us .
MCCONNELL: What about the sound ? That signal you heard before the explosion ?
LUKE: Good , Jim , good . That 's the key .
MCCONNELL: Mathematical ?
LUKE: That 's what I thought . There are distinct blocks in the pattern , and within each block the tones come in groups of three . Threethreethree . For months I struggled to analyze it , trying different constructs Then I thought about dimensions .
MCCONNELL: X-Y-Z coordinates
LUKE: Right ! Three groups equals three dimensions So I tried assigning different graphic values to each lock , group and tone . And finally I got this .
PHIL: My God Is that what I think it is ?
TERRI: DNA that 's a model of DNA !
LUKE: You see it , too . Thank God . I was afraid I was just suffering from a form of asphyxia .
PHIL: So , okay , so somebody left this thing here , somebody other than human . But what the hell is it ?
LUKE: My guess is , it 's a signature . A self-portrait of whatever species created the Face .
MCCONNELL: But that DNA looks human .
TERRI: No way . It 's missing the last pai of chromosomes . See ?
MCCONNELL: Yeah , but it 's close . Damn close .
TERRI: The difference between a man and an ape is less than three percent of genetic material . But that three percent gives you Mozart . Einstein .
PHIL: Or Jack the Ripper .
TERRI: C'mon . There 's a pair of scissors in my medkit .
MCCONNELL: How do you feel ?
LUKE: Like I just got back my other three percent .
TERRI: The backup generator is salvageable , and two of the solar panels . I 'm pretty sure I can get the oxygen still back into production , too . So we 're not in such bad shape , considering .
LUKE: Good work , Terri .
MCCONNELL: Look at that . Phil 's idea of absolute essentials .
MCCONNELL: It 's not a signature .
LUKE: What ?
MCCONNELL: That noise from the Face It 's not a signature . It 's a test . Luke and Terri stare at him .
LUKE: But why ?
MCCONNELL: To prove that we 're human .
LUKE: We fired radar into that thing . Concentrated sound waves
MCCONNELL: Which it interpreted as a wrong answer Yes ! It 's like a , a security alarm . When it gets an incorrect esponse , it defends itself .
PHIL: So what happens when it gets the ight answer ?
MCCONNELL: I do n't know . But we 've got to find out . Can you work this the other way ? Figure out which tones would be equivalent to the missing chromosomes ? Then dub them into your recording of the signal ?
LUKE: I think so , yes .
MCCONNELL: What about the radar gun ? Will it accept that input ? Can we transmit a completed signal back to the Face ?
PHIL: Whoa , whoa , hold on , Jim . What if you 're wrong ? Whoever goes out there I mean , what if you 're wrong ? Three people have already died ove that thing .
TERRI: Four . McConnell looks at her .
MCCONNELL: Terri , if we leave here without getting some answers , they all died in vain . Terri shakes her head .
TERRI: We just do n't know enough about that that thing out there to take any more chances .
MCCONNELL: What are we here for , if not to take chances ?
LUKE: We do n't have to go out there . There 's a better way . They look at him , surprised .
LUKE: Checking video feed
MCCONNELL: How close do we need to get ?
LUKE: I 'm not sure . Maybe we better stop y that boulder .
PHIL: Oh my God
LUKE: It worked It worked !
MCCONNELL: Check for radiation .
LUKE: Normal . Seismic normal . Anemomete steady . No sign of the vortex .
PHIL: I do n't know what we did , but guys does that look to you like a hostile gesture ?
TERRI: No . More like an invitation .
LUKE: Or another test
MCCONNELL: Luke , the four-man rover . Does it still work ?
MCCONNELL: How long before it hits ?
LUKE: An hour ? Maybe less .
MCCONNELL: How bad ?
LUKE: A storm like that ? It could go planetary . And last a year . McConnell stares at him .
MCCONNELL: Phil , how much longer to prep the
PHIL: Maybe forty-five minutes . It 'll be tight , but we can make it .
MCCONNELL: Then there 's still time for us to get out there and back .
PHIL: Go back alone ?
MCCONNELL: If we 're not back in forty-five minutes , I want you to prep and launch . That 's 1950 hours .
PHIL: Jim
MCCONNELL: It 's not a suggestion , it 's an order . You understand ?
PHIL: I understand . But
MCCONNELL: You understand what ?
PHIL: If you 're not back by 1950 , I prep and launch .
MCCONNELL: Let 's go .
PHIL: Yeah , Jim . Your signal 's breaking up a little in the storm , but I read you .
MCCONNELL: We 're at the Face . We 're gon na need a few minutes here . Same deadline , launch at 1950 . With or without us . Do you copy ?
PHIL: Copy that . Terri and Luke exchange a tense glance .
TERRI: Jim , are you sure you want to do this ?
MCCONNELL: I 'm not sure of anything anymore . But I did n't come a hundred million miles just to turn back in the last ten feet .
LUKE: Roger that . Texture is smooth .
TERRI: I 've got good footing and no obstructions . Let 's check our
MCCONNELL: Do n't move ! Keep this orientation .
PHIL: Computers are online ! Ready to load software . But guys we 're losing visibility here .
TERRI: Jim , what 're you doing ? You 'll depressurize !
MCCONNELL: I do n't think so .
LUKE: Jim , seal it !
MCCONNELL: No . That was air going into my suit , not out . Look at your own suits they 're not rigid anymore . We 've got pressure in here . Luke looks at his sleeve . McConnell 's right .
TERRI: Above Mars atmospheric ? That 's impossible .
MCCONNELL: We 're millions of miles from Earth and we 're inside a gigantic white face . What 's impossible ? Terri types on her arm keypad . She 's amazed .
TERRI: There 's six psi in here Nitrogen and oxygen .
LUKE: Otherwise known as air ?
TERRI: Hey , there may be some lethal trace gasses I have n't picked up yet , or or oh , the hell with it .
MCCONNELL: Is that what I think it is ?
LUKE: Yeah . It 's Mars .
TERRI: Oh my God .
LUKE: We 're Martians ?
MCCONNELL: That 's what she means .
TERRI: Oh my God . The Cambrian explosion . McConnell and Luke look at her .
LUKE: They seeded Earth .
PHIL: in , please . Can you me ?
TERRI: Phil , we 're here ! We read you .
PHIL: Thank God ! Listen , this storm is eally few more minutes , I ca n't You 've got ta get back to the ship !
TERRI: Phil ? Phil ?
MCCONNELL: We are in a ship . This is a ship . And the countdown has already started . Terri looks at Luke , alarmed .
LUKE: He 's right .
TERRI: Then let 's get the hell out of here !
LUKE: Jim McConnell does n't turn .
MCCONNELL: I 'm not coming with you .
TERRI: What ?
MCCONNELL: That 's where I 'm going . Do n't you see ? That 's what all this is for . You were right Terri . This is an invitation . To follow them . To follow them home .
LUKE: I once felt like I was taking you turn . But now I think maybe you 're taking mine . Guess I 'm a little jealous .
MCCONNELL: My pleasure .
TERRI: I wish Woody were here to see this . He would 've wanted to go too , Jim .
MCCONNELL: He 's here , Terri . We would n't have made it without him .
TERRI: Take care , Jim .
LUKE: Hey , Jim ?
MCCONNELL: Yeah ?
LUKE: Have a great ride .
MCCONNELL: Always do .
LUKE: Phil ? Phil , do you read ? He 's not reading .
TERRI: I can barely read you . Let 's get the hell out of here !
PHIL: Is anyone there ? Can anyone read me ?
TERRI: I 've lost the Base Camp beacon ! Luke looks over alarmed .
LUKE: I 'll try to keep on a straight line ! It 's our only chance .
TERRI: Do n't worry ! I 've worked with Phil for four years ! I know Jim gave him a direct order , but he wo n't leave without us .
PHIL: This is ERV , do you read ? ERV to Rover , do you read ?
LUKE: Save the fuel , Phil . We 're coming in .
PHIL: Uh , Phil 's not here right now . He left for Earth five minutes ago . Please leave your message at the eep .
TERRI: He got another ride . Phil stares at her , bewildered .
LUKE: Tell you on the way . Let 's go !
TERRI: Dear God . Look at that .
PHIL: Is that him ?
LUKE: Godspeed Jim McConnell .
BILLY: It 's okay , Joe , you can leave it on . It 's no big deal .
SECURITY GUARD: No , it 's okay , I do n't need to watch it .
BILLY: How 's Meg ?
SECURITY GUARD: She 's good , thanks .
BILLY: And the boys ?
SECURITY GUARD: They 're good . Everybody 's good .
BILLY: That 's good .

TO TARA: What did she say ?
TARA: She said we had to hurry up .
BILLY: Scott ? Scott ?
TARA: We 're losing Damon ?
BILLY: Wait , do n't hang up . Do n't hang up
TARA: Try to relax .
BILLY: A small emergency is starting to develop .
TARA: Try . Try to relax .
BILLY: You look fantastic today .

ARN: Thank you .
BILLY: What did they offer ?
ARN: He 's not staying in Oakland , Billy .
BILLY: What did the Yankees offer him ?
ARN: It 's New York ; you 've got to give a player a reason not to play there .
BILLY: What did they offer ?
ARN: 17 million .
BILLY: No way .
ARN: Yeah .
BILLY: I do n't pay my whole infield 17 million dollars .
ARN: I know , I know
BILLY: For how long ?
ARN: 17 a year for seven years . Billy stares , completely nonplussed
BILLY: A hundred and twenty million dollars ?
ARN: Hundred and nineteen .
BEAT: You got ta get Steve to let you spend some money .
BILLY: That 's pretty good advice , I should do that .
ARN: Steve does n't get it . This is n't a charity raffle .
BILLY: Arn . I get it , he gets it , Jason gets it and you certainly get it . I 'll talk to him .
ARN: And you 're losing Isringhausen , too .
BILLY: Ya think ?
ARN: I 've got ta get back .
BILLY: Hey mazel tov , Arn .
ARN: Thank you . Good luck .
KID: Are you Billy Beane ?
BILLY: Yes .
KID: That was a pretty serious choke .
BILLY: Are you from around here ?
KID: Yeah .
BILLY: You a Dodger fan ?
KID: Yeah . Billy hands the kid his scotch
BILLY: Here , drink a lot of this . and walks away .
SCHOTT: Isringhausen 's gone , too , do n't you think ?
BILLY: I can win without a closer . I ca n't without power .
SCHOTT: So negotiate with them .
BILLY: I have . They want more .
SCHOTT: So offer them a little more .
BILLY: I have . They want more than a little more .
SCHOTT: Like what . What 'll it cost - say - to keep Giambi ?
SCHOTT: 17 for how many -
BILLY: One .
SCHOTT: For one year ?
BILLY: I ca n't .
SCHOTT: Sure you can .
SCHOTT: Billy . What are we ? The Taj Mahal ? We 're a small-market team . Obviously , we ca n't afford Giambi at such a -
BILLY: Fine . He 's gone . But I might - for a it more than last year - be able to keep Damon in - ( Steve is shaking his
HEAD NO: I need more money , Steve .
SCHOTT: Billy
BILLY: I ca n't compete against a hundred and twenty million dollar payroll with a forty million dollar payroll .
SCHOTT: We just won 102 games with a forty million dollar payroll .
BILLY: With Giambi and Damon . We would n't have without them . Silence . Then -
SCHOTT: You 're not a professional athlete !
BEAT: You 're a professional GM .
BEAT: Got it ?
BILLY: Scott . Billy .
PAUSE: Why ?
BILLY: Okay . Billy 's cell phone rings
GRADY: Alright , guys we had a great year . We won 102 games and we only came a buck short in New York . Now the bad news we 've got three big holes to fill .
THEN: Let 's start with who we like for Giambi . We 'll go around the room . Who you like , Matty ?
KEOUGH: I like Geronimo . ( approval from the
OTHER SCOUTS: Guy 's an athlete . This guy is big , fast and talented .
GEORGE: Six foot four .
PITTARO: Top of my list .
POTE: Clean cut , good face .
ARTIE: Good jaw . He 's the real deal .
GEORGE: Five tools , good lookin ' .
BILLY: Can he hit ?
KEOUGH: He 's a tools guy .
BILLY: Can he hit ?
KEOUGH: He 's got a great swing . Natural swing .
BILLY: So you 're saying he ca n't hit .
KEOUGH: He can hit .
BARRY: The ball explodes off his bat .
ARTIE: It 's exciting . When he hits it sounds like he 's droppin ' a firecracker at his feet .
PITTARO: Down in the pisser you can hear that sound .
BARRY: Sounds like Mays , Mantle , Aaron
BILLY: That 's not what I asked . I asked can he hit .
KEOUGH: He 's a good hitter .
BILLY: If he 's a good hitter , why does n't he hit good ?
KEOUGH: He needs a little work . He 'll be able to hit . He could be a great hitter .
BILLY: Right we put him up against big league competition and suddenly he 'll be able to hit . Grady moves on
GRADY: Artie , who do we like ?
ARTIE: I like Perez . He swings like a man .
KEOUGH: He swings like a man who swings at too much .
ARTIE: There 's some work needs to be done . I admit it . He needs to be reworked a little . But he 's noticeable .
GRADY: He 's notable ?
ARTIE: No , he 's noticeable . You notice him .
KEOGH: He 's got an ugly girlfriend .
BARRY: What 's that mean ?
KEOGH: Ugly girlfriend means no confidence .
BARRY: Alright . That 's true .
PITTARO: I agree with Art . I like the way he walks into a room . Kid 's so confident his dick gets there two minutes before he does .
GEORGE: Passes the eye candy test . He 's got the looks , he 's ready to play the part . He just needs some playing time .
KEOUGH: I 'm just saying , his girlfriend 's a 6 .
BARRY: Billy , if you want to talk about anothe Giambi , this guy could be it .
GRADY: Is that a suggestion , Billy ?
BILLY: Guys , stop . You 're talking like this is usiness as usual . It 's not .
GRADY: We 're trying to solve the problem .
BILLY: Not like this . You 're not even looking at the problem .
GRADY: We not only have a very clea understanding of the problem we now face , ut everyone in this room has faced similar problems countless times before .
BILLY: Good . What 's the problem ?
GRADY: The problem is that we 've lost 3 key players that we now have to replace .
BILLY: Uh-uh . What 's the problem ?
PITTARO: The problem is the same as it always is ; we 've got to put a team together with what we 've got .
BILLY: Uh-uh . What 's the problem ?
BARRY: We 've got 38 home runs to replace , 120 i 's , 47 doubles
BILLY: Okay , stop . The problem we 're trying to solve is that this is an unfair game . There are rich teams , poor teams , 50 feet of crap and then there 's us . And now we 've been gutted . We 're organ donors to the rich . The Red Sox took our kidneys and the Yankees took our heart . And now I 'm listening to the same old shit about having a good body and being a tools guy like you 're looking for Fabio . Is there another first baseman like Giambi ?
BEAT: Is there ? Everyone mumbles `` no . ''
BILLY: Then stop looking for one because what we 'll surely wind up with is the McNuggets version of Giambi .
GRADY: Look , we 're gon na find 25 guys , put ` em through player development , teach ` em how to play Oakland A baseball . This is no time to push the panic button . This is the way we 've been doing it for 150 years . Let us do our job .
BILLY: If we try to play like the Yankees in here , we 're not going to be able to play with them out there .
GRADY: That 's fortune cookie wisdom .
BILLY: No , it 's just regular wisdom .
POTE: Who 's Fabio ?
GRADY: Okay , Billy . Clearly you have something on your mind .
BILLY: Bill James .
ARTIE: You 're not serious ?
PITTARO: We 're not playing fantasy baseball , Billy .
BARRY: Those are n't new ideas , they disproved that years ago .
GRADY: Bill James was a night security guard at the Stokely Van Camp Pork and Beans Factory .
BILLY: He thinks differently than anyone in aseball .
GRADY: He 's not in baseball . He 's in pork and eans .
BILLY: Do n't attack the man , attack the argument .
PITTARO: I think he just won the argument . Chuckles .
BILLY: What if we 've been wrong this whole time about what ingredients manufacture a win ? What if this whole time we thought it was the chicken that made the chicken soup taste good when really it was the onions that made the chicken soup taste good ? Onions are a lot cheaper than chicken , you see what I 'm saying ?
POTE: I do n't have the first idea what you 're saying .
BILLY: We got ta start over . We got ta rethink this thing . We got ta look where others are n't looking .
GRADY: With all due respect , we 've been doing this for a long time .
BILLY: That does n't mean you 're doing it right . Do you watch nature docs ? You know what happens to the runt of the litter ? He dies . I 'm open to any solution , as long as it 's not what the other guys are doing .
THEN: Now , I 'm going to Cleveland to poach an outfielder named Brandon Garcia
TBD SCOUT: Hold on You 're going to Cleveland fo a double-A guy ?
GRADY: Billy , I 've seen Garcia . He 's got a bad ody . It 's not a pretty sight .
PITTARO: Kid wears a large pair of underwear .
KEOGH: That is a big boy .
GRADY: He 's not just big , but kind of doughy . A fleshy kind of body .
BILLY: Oh , you mean like Babe Ruth .
PITTARO: When he walks , Billy , his thighs stick together . There 's enough friction there to start a bonfire .
KEOGH: If you saw him , I 'm telling you , you would n't want to go to Cleveland .
BARRY: Billy , can I make a suggestion ? If you could get Ricardo Rincon he 'd be worth the trip to Cleveland .
GEORGE: That would solve our left handed relieve problem . Unanimous approval from the scouts
BILLY: Really ?
THEN: I 'm asking you guys to look at this game differently than you 've ever looked at it efore . I 'm going to Cleveland .
BILLY: And Grady ? Nobody cares about a 102 win season . Billy storms out .
KEOUGH: What 's a Fabergé egg ?
SABATINI: This is the guy .
MARTINEZ: He 's got a great path . I love the extension in his swing and the backspin he creates .
SABATINI: That 's some amazing power right there , huh ?
MARTINEZ: Good approach , great balance . How 's he compare to the others around the country ?
SABATINI: He 's number one . Let 's just hope he 's still there when we pick .
MARTINEZ: This guy 'll go in the first round .
SABATINI: Billy . I 'm Sabatini , Area Scout , New York Mets . Can we get a couple minutes of your time , find out more about you ?
BILLY: Of course .
SABATINI: I 'd like to introduce you to Tom Martinez .
MARTINEZ: Very impressive performance today . In my job as the national cross-checker for the New York Mets , I see the top 200 players in the United States . It 's been a while since I 've seen a five tools guy , the complete package . Your throwing ability , your fielding skills Ed told me you had power but I had no idea it was of the light tower variety . I hope you 're as interested in professional baseball as we are in acquiring you in the upcoming draft .
BILLY: Well , sir , I 'd need to talk it out with my parents , decide if baseball is something I want to do full time . I have a scholarship to play football at Stanford .
MARTINEZ: Well , Billy , we 're certainly looking forward to meeting your folks and talking to them as well . And we believe in college , but that 's something you can do in the winter months . You need to know the sky 's the limit with your ability . You could be a superstar before you 've even graduated . But to get to that level , you need to work with our people . Pro-ball is where you need to be to develop the skills God gave you .
ASSISTANT: Mr. Beane ? Mark 's ready to see you now .
SHAPIRO: So Billy , what are you looking for ?
BILLY: 50 million in additional payroll .
SHAPIRO: Try Giambi .
BILLY: Ouch .
SHAPIRO: 120 million .
BILLY: I should 've been a hitter .
SHAPIRO: Where 's Steve in all this ?
BILLY: Supportive . Excited about rebuilding the team .
SHAPIRO: Bonds is available .
BILLY: Yeah , how do I afford the rest of the field ?
SHAPIRO: So what are you looking for ? I want to help out .
BILLY: I guess you 've touched the bottom of the sports industry when your opponent is
SHAPIRO: Not going to happen .
BILLY: Not even a discussion ?
SHAPIRO: Come on Billy , even if you could afford him we 're not about to let him go .
BILLY: Why 's that ? You 've got the Venezuelan kid in North Carolina you 're bringing up .
SHAPIRO: We dished him to Detroit . Keep up .
BILLY: Well there goes my other idea .
SHAPIRO: What else you thinking Billy ?
BILLY: You have any outfielders I should be looking at ?
SHAPIRO: To replace Damon ?
BILLY: Yeah .
SHAPIRO: That 's a tough one Billy .
BILLY: Yeah . Who do you got ?
SHAPIRO: The guys you might be able to afford ? Hollins , Garcia Coste .
BILLY: Tell me about Garcia .
SHAPIRO: To replace Damon ? !
BILLY: Is he healthy ?
SHAPIRO: He had a back thing , some minor surgery , ut he 's okay . Petey ?
PETEY: He 'll be good by Spring Training .
BILLY: He 'll do . I can give you Guthrie for him if you kick in some cash .
SHAPIRO: Mark Guthrie ?
SHAPIRO: Sorry about that . So Garcia is going to be a no . What else are you thinking about ?
BILLY: Let 's make it work , I 'll go straight up with you , Garcia for Guthrie , no kicker .
SHAPIRO: Sorry Billy , who else you interested in ?
BILLY: Hey .
PETER: Hi .
BILLY: Who are you ?
PETER: My name is Peter Brand .
BILLY: What do you do ?
PETER: I 'm special assistant to Mark Shapiro .
BILLY: So what do you do ? ( pointing at co-
WORKER: Hey , mind your own business .
HE DOES: What do you do ?
PETER: Mostly player evaluation right now .
BILLY: Why does Mark listen to you ?
PETER: Actually he rarely does .
BILLY: He just did .
PETER: I do n't think he was really listening to me in there per se .
BILLY: Really ?
PETER: Yeah , I think he was listening to Bruce .
BILLY: Who are you ?
PETER: Peter Brand .
BILLY: I do n't give a rat 's ass about your name . Nothing from Peter .
PETER: I 'm not sure what you 're asking me .
BILLY: What did you tell Butch ?
PETER: Huh ? Oh Bruce ? I told him I like Garcia .
BEAT: Why ?
BEAT: Probably for the same reasons you do .
BILLY: Meaning what ?
PETER: He 's undervalued . You were smart to go after him .
LONG BEAT: What makes him undervalued ?
BILLY: Come on .
PETER: Maryland .
BILLY: Where did you go to school ?
PETER: Yale .
BILLY: I hate Yale .
PETER: Why ?
BILLY: Kid from Yale once blocked a trade I was trying to make . What 'd you study ?
PETER: Economics .
BILLY: What are you doing in baseball ?
PETER: I love baseball .
BILLY: I 'm just curious . Why were you so cagey in there ?
PETER: I work for a different team .
BILLY: I know , but I 'm the first person in aseball who 's ever talked to you this long . Right ? Why is Garcia undervalued ?
PETER: Okay , truthfully , it might not be so easy to explain .
BILLY: Really ? Why 's that Peter ?
PETER: We might not see the game the same way .
BILLY: Oh really ? What do you mean by that ?
PETER: You 've spent your life in baseball and I do n't have a very traditional view of the game .
BILLY: Hey Pete , just say it . I 'm not about to eat you up . Say what you 've always wanted to say to a GM .
PETER: Baseball thinking is medieval . It 's stuck in the Dark Ages . I have a more scientific view of the game .
BILLY: Keep going , Peter .
PETER: There is an epidemic failure within the game to understand what 's really happening . And it leads people who run major league teams to misjudge thei players and mismanage their teams . They 're still asking the wrong questions . People who run baseball teams still think in terms of buying players . Sorry to say that .
BILLY: Peter , do n't apologize for what you elieve .
PETER: The goal should n't be to buy players , what you want to buy is wins . To buy wins , you buy runs . You 're trying to eplace Johnny Damon . The Red Sox look at Johnny Damon and they see a star worth seven point five million a year . When I look at Johnny Damon , I see an imperfect understanding of where runs come from .
BILLY: You read Bill James , Pete ?
PETER: Yes . These ideas and this approach to the game are n't all new . In fact , some of them have been around for two decades .
BILLY: If this approach has been around for so long , why is n't anybody in baseball doing them ?
PETER: That 's a much more difficult question than how to win baseball games . Once you egin to pull at that string , you understanding of the world might begin to unravel . The elevator door closes .
MOTHER: Billy ? They 're here .
JONGEWAARD: Billy Good to see you again . Obviously you 're a very special player . We 'd like to compliment you on your high school career , and we 're looking forward to you being a part of the Mets family .
MOTHER: Billy 's been offered a scholarship to Stanford .
JONGEWAARD: I know . And that 's a great accomplishment . I 'm sure you 're very proud of him .
MOTHER: So he can accept that , go there , and then -
JONGEWAARD: I understand how important college is . I do . But what I ca n't do is burn a second first-round draft pick on someone who ca n't play for four years no matte how good he is . Four years is ample time for someone to get hurt . It happens all the time . So , no . I 'm sorry . It has to e one or the other . To postpone fou years is four years he could be in big leagues . The sooner he gets there the sooner he can reap the benefits .
FATHER: It 's your decision , Billy . Whatever you decide is fine with us .
PETER: Hello ?
BILLY: It 's Billy Beane .
PETER: What time is it ?
BILLY: I do n't care . Would you have drafted me in the first round ?
PETER: What ?
BILLY: After I left you ran me through you computer , right ? Would you have drafted me in the first round ?
PETER: You were a good baseball player .
BILLY: Would you have drafted me in the first ound ?
PAUSE: I 'd have drafted you in the ninth round . No signing bonus . You 'd have passed and gone to Stanford .
BILLY: Pack your suitcases .
PETER: Why ?
BILLY: I just bought you from the Cleveland Indians .
PETER: Good evening .
BILLY: I asked you to do three .
PETER: Yes .
BILLY: To evaluate three available players .
PETER: Yeah .
BILLY: And how many did you do ?
PETER: 51 , I do n't know why I lied just then .
BILLY: Talk me through the wall .
PETER: This is the American League West . This year we 're going to need to win between 97 and 101 games to make the post season . Here 's the number of runs we 'll need to score in order to win those games and here 's the number of runs we can allow .
BILLY: Let 's make sure we 're on the same page .
PETER: Okay .
BILLY: We 're going to re-think baseball .
PETER: Yes .
BILLY: Look for an inefficiencies in statistics .
PETER: Examine the ways that runs are scored and prevented .
BILLY: Exploit the fact that unspectacular runs are just as valuable as 450-foot bombs .
PETER: Unspectacular runs are more valuable .
BILLY: Why ?
SIMULTANEOUSLY: Because they cost less .
BILLY: We believe there 's a river that has n't een fished .
PETER: We know it for sure .
BILLY: And because players have been overlooked ecause they do n't rise to the standards of traditional baseball thinking , we elieve that in this river , there are fishfish who Help me with
PETER: Forget the fish . In this room is every available player at every level of professional baseball , and somewhere in that group are 25 players that everyone has else has thrown out .
BILLY: Yes . But let me ask you this . If ou theory is right
PETER: Math is n't a theory .
BILLY: If it 's right
PETER: It 's right .
BILLY: It sounds right .
PETER: It is right .
BILLY: If math is n't a theory
PETER: It is n't .
BILLY: I 'm gon na punch you in the kidneys if you do n't let me finish a sentence .
PETER: Sorry .
BILLY: If this is right , why is n't everybody doing it ? In fact , why is n't anybody doing it ?
PETER: Somebody once said , `` It 's not what you do n't know that worries me it 's what you know for sure that 's got me scared . '' In the mid-19th Century in Budapest there was an incredibly high instance of mothers dying shortly after childbirth from a disease called puerperal fever .
BILLY: Make this story less boring as soon as you can .
PETER: A doctor named Semmelweiss showed that if the attending physicians and nurses sterilized their hands before delivery , the mortality rate dropped to 1 % .
BILLY: And he was vilified ?
PETER: He was institutionalized . For suggesting that washing your hands before putting them inside someone else 's body was a good idea . High functioning people can live under the spell of an inexplicable mental lapse when they think as a group . Why is n't anybody else doing it ? Because they do n't think guys who look like you are what win baseball games . They know it for sure .
PAUSE: Alright , let 's find our team .
BILLY: Nervous ?
PETER: No ? ?
BILLY: Huh . Interesting . Peter does n't know what to make of that .
ART: Can I talk to you a second before you get started .
BILLY: I got a lot to do .
ART: I know .
BILLY: That 's Peter .
ART: I ca n't manage this team under a one-yea contract .
BILLY: Sure you can .
ART: No I ca n't .
BILLY: I 've got to put a team on the field , then I 'll deal with your contract .
ART: How about you deal with the manager 's contract and then put a team on the field ?
BILLY: At the moment , if a ground ball is hit to first base , nobody 's going to be there to stop it from rolling .
ART: I have to tell you it 's not easy doing what I do under the cloud of a one-yea contract .
BILLY: I know . I been there .
ART: I know you have . And a 1-year contract says the same thing to a manager as it does to a player There 's not a lot of faith there . Which is strange after a 102-win season .
BILLY: If you lose the last one of the season nobody gives a shit about the others .
ART: It 's on me now ?
BILLY: It 's on me , Art !
BEAT: And the kid 's the new assistant general manager .
PAUSE: What the fuck are you about to do ?
GRADY: How did it go in Cleveland ?
BILLY: It was cold . The news bothers no one .
GRADY: Let 's get after our relief pitching problem .
BILLY: We got Chad Bradford . Right-hander .
GRADY: Submariner ?
BILLY: That 's the one . Technically an underhander .
GRADY: What 's his velocity ?
BILLY: Unimpressive .
ARTIE: About 85 .
GRADY: Does he have a good breaking ball ?
BILLY: Does n't have one .
GRADY: Why do you like this guy ?
BILLY: Well , he gets people out .
ARTIE: The left-hander hitters get a really good look at him .
GRADY: He 's down there . He 's down there real low , too .
BILLY: Let 's move on .
GRADY: Well , we , I think , have fared better . We have some ideas for what to do about Giambi .
BILLY: Knock me down .
GRADY: We trade power for speed . A rabbit for a gorilla - We go for an overachiever . A ig heart in the last year his contract . Tend to play hard . We usually get a pretty good year out of them . Make up for some of the offense we lost . Or the other option . Just a thought . We go for a high-maintenance guy . A guy that 's a little difficult but talented . A guy like Milton Bradley . Well , not like Milton . Milton himself . Which do you want to talk about first ?
BILLY: None of them .
BARRY: We got some trades here .
BILLY: We ca n't do it . What we can do is ecreate his value to us in the aggregate .
GRADY: The -
BILLY: Giambi 's on-base percentage was .477 . Damon 's was .324 . And Olmeda 's - bless his heart - was .291 . Add that up and you get - He points to Peter .
PETER: You want me to speak ?
BILLY: When I point at you , yes .
PETER: Ten-ninety-two .
BILLY: Divided by three -
PETER: Three-sixty-four .
BILLY: That 's what we 're looking for . And that 's what we 'll find . Three players whose average OBP is -
PETER: Three-sixty-four .
ARTIE: That does n't come out right .
BILLY: You got ta carry the one .
ARTIE: Still do n't look right .
BILLY: It 's right .
GRADY: Billy ?
BILLY: Yes .
GRADY: Who 's that ?
BILLY: That 's Peter .
GRADY: I do n't know how to say this delicately - ut does - Peter - need to be here ?
BILLY: Yes .
POLONI: What 's with this on base percentage obsession ? Is that Bill James bullshit ?
BILLY: You can call it Billy Beane bullshit fo all I care .
BARRY: He never comes home from the games .
POLONI: Billy , if I may , he 's had his problems on the field not to mention his problems off the field not to mention he 's getting a little thick around the middle there 's the stuff with the weed . He 's at strip joints
GRADY: This guy could start the year with an agent and end up with a parole office for Christ 's sake .
BILLY: His on-base percentage is all we 're looking at now and he gets on base an awful lot for someone who only costs $ 285,000 a year .
GEORGE: He ca n't catch a ball in the outfield . I 've seen him lose a ball in the moonlight . Billy puts up another name DAVID JUSTICE .
BILLY: David Justice .
GRADY: Ten years ago he was a big name . He 's going to really help our season tickets at the beginning of the year . But by June he 's not going to be hitting his weight .
PITTARO: He 's 36 !
ARTIE: His legs are gone . He 's a defensive liability . I question whether the bat speed is still there .
BARRY: Steinbrenner is so pissed at his decline he 's willing to eat up half his contract to get rid of him .
BILLY: That 's good .
HOPKINS: He 's a fossil . With all due respect , inging these three guys aboard is like putting bubble gum on a flat tire .
GRADY: And why do we want to be the ones to bail Justice out of his contract ? Billy points at PETER
PETER: He gets on base .
GRADY: I got 37 free agents who are better than those guys .
BILLY: Scott Hatteberg .
POTE: Who ?
BILLY: Exactly . Sounds like an Oakland A already . Yes , he 's got a little damage in his elbow .
GRADY: Some damage ? He ca n't throw .
BILLY: We 're not interested in him for his arm anymore than we wanted Giambi for his .
GRADY: Wait , you 're talkin ' about Hatteberg at first ?
BILLY: Yes .
HOPKINS: He 's a career .260 hitter and the good part of his career is over .
BILLY: I say it 's just starting .
PITTARO: Well , Billy , you 'll like the sound of this I hear Boston wants to cut him and no one wants to pick him up .
BILLY: That 's good news for us . He 's cheap .
GRADY: Let me understand this . At first base you want a guy who 's been cut from half of the minor league teams in the country due to irreparable nerve damage ?
BILLY: He ca n't hit and he ca n't field , but what can he do ?
BEAT: Look at the piece of paper or I 'm going to point at Peter .
BILLY: He can get on base .
POLONI: Alright , so he walks a lot .
BILLY: He gets on base a lot , Rocco . Do I care if it 's a walk or a hit ?
PETER: You do not .
POLONI: These three players , by your own admission , are defective in one way o another .
BILLY: Yeah .
GRADY: You want to replace Jason Giambi with not one but three defective players ?
BILLY: You got it .
GRADY: Billy , we 've all been busting our asses the last six and a half weeks to make this a better ball
BILLY: Grady , it 's not a discussion .
POTE: I think we 're all losing sight of the fact that you 're the general manager . You only have to answer to ownership and God .
BILLY: I did n't know God followed baseball .
POTE: I hope he does .
WASHINGTON: Billy , I just do n't see it .
BILLY: That 's okay , Wash. We wo n't be victimized y what we see anymore .
WASHINGTON: I understand what you 're saying about their averages , but there 's something you 're forgetting . None of them plays first base .
BILLY: I have n't forgotten that , Wash. One of them is going to have to learn .
WASHINGTON: Learn .
BILLY: You 're going to have to teach him .
WASHINGTON: Teach .
BILLY: Instruct .
WASHINGTON: Which one ?
SCOTT: Hello ?
ELIZABETH: Honey ?
BILLY: Thank you , ma'am .
WASHINGTON: Thank you , ma'am .
BILLY: You 've played catcher your whole life ?
SCOTT: Since I was 8 .
BILLY: How 's the elbow ?
SCOTT: Good . Real good . It 's great .
FUCK IT: I ca n't throw at all .
BILLY: Yeah , do n't worry about it . You 've thrown your last baseball from behind the plate . I want you at first .
SCOTT: I 've only ever played catcher .
BILLY: You 're not a catcher anymore . If you were , then mine would n't have been the only call you got when your contract expired at midnight .
SCOTT: I appreciate it but
BILLY: You 're welcome .
BILLY: You do n't know how to play first base .
SCOTT: That 's right .
BILLY: It 's not that hard . Tell him , Wash .
WASHINGTON: It 's incredibly hard !
BILLY: Anything worth doing is . Wash is gon na teach you .
SCOTT: Wait a minute , what about
BILLY: Jason 's gone , Scott .
SCOTT: I 'm taking Giambi 's spot at first ? What about the fans ?
WASHINGTON: Yeah , maybe I can teach one of them .
BILLY: The fans do n't run
GOOD ONE: the fans do n't run my ball club .
SCOTT: They 're gon na hate me .
WASHINGTON: No , they 're gon na hate him .
BILLY: The fans love me .
WASHINGTON: Okay .
BILLY: Hello .
HATTEBERG'S DAUGHTER: Hi .
SCOTT: That 's our youngest daughter .
BILLY: Great .
SCOTT: Do you have kids ?
BILLY: yeah , I have a daughter .
SHARON: Hi , Billy .
BILLY: She home ?
SHARON: She 's out , but she 'll be home soon .
ON PHONE: Yeah , no , do n't worry about it sweetie . Here 's mom . Alan hands Sharon the phone .
BILLY: Hey Alan .
ALAN: Come on in have a seat . Want some coconut water ? It 's really refreshing .
BILLY: I 'm all set , thanks .
ALAN: What are you benching now ?
BILLY: I do n't keep count .
ALAN: Well , whatever it is , it 's working . You look good .
BEAT: Yep .
ALAN: You know what I say ?
BILLY: Fuck ` em .
BEAT: I 'm sorry Alan , what do you say ?
ALAN: No , I just wanted to say that a lot of teams do n't get that far , and to make it that far is a really big accomplishment . Sharon gets off the phone and joins them .
TO SHARON: So how is she ?
SHARON: She 's great . Be here in a minute . How 's the team shaping up ?
BILLY: New beginnings . Blue horizons .
ALAN: I read that you lost two players . Damon
MISPRONOUNCES: Ghee-ambi ?
SHARON: Giambi . Wow , that 's tough . That 's really tough .
BILLY: And Isringhausen .
ALAN: Sounds tough .
BILLY: So where is she ?
ALAN: I just talked to her on her cell . She 's just coming up the hill , she 's two minutes away .
BILLY: You bought her a cell phone ?
SHARON: Yeah .
BILLY: At 12 ?
ALAN: Just for emergencies . I 'm sorry , we should have consulted you for that
BILLY: It 's probably a good idea .
SHARON: But actually I called you -
BILLY: Let 's go shopping .
CASEY: I like the red ones .
BILLY: How about this ?
CASEY: Yeah , that 's cool .
BILLY: Let 's try it out over here .
GENUINELY IMPRESSED: Casey .
CASEY: Yeah .
BILLY: You got good .
CASEY: I 've just been playing a lot .
BILLY: That 's that 's not the way most 12 yea olds play .
CASEY: Alan thinks I should have a bette teacher .
BILLY: Who 's Alan ? CASEY looks at him
CASEY: Alan thinks I should be working more on technique so I do n't learn bad habits .
BILLY: Well , you seem to be doing just fine to me . Do you like playing ?
CASEY: I love it .
BILLY: That 's so great . I 'm so happy for you . The most important thing in life is to find something you love and do it well . Do you like your teacher ?
CASEY: Yeah .
BILLY: Okay , I 'll talk to Mom and Alan . Do you like that guitar ?
CASEY: Yes !
BILLY: That the one ?
CASEY: Yeah , I think so .
BILLY: Let 's get it . Let 's get it now .
CASEY: Really ?
BILLY: Merry Christmas .
UMPIRE: Striiike !
UMPIRE: Strike !
PETER: How 'd it go ?
BILLY: How 'd what go ?
PETER: Hatteberg .
BILLY: He can barely hold a baseball . But he 's our guy now . Billy sits .
PETER: That is Kevin Youkilis . This is the guy we want more than anyone else in the world .
GRADY: Can we talk a minute ?
BILLY: Yeah .
TO PETER: Yeah .
GRADY: Your boy and I had a talk while you were in Tacoma . I did n't like much of what I heard .
BILLY: No ?
GRADY: No . You got a kid in there with a Yale economics degree and a scout out here with 29 years baseball experience and you 're listening to the wrong one .
BILLY: I do n't listen to anyone , you know that .
GRADY: This is n't a joke .
BILLY: I 'm not joking .
GRADY: This is n't how you run a ball club , with a computer . You know that . You 're a aseball man . There are intangibles that only a scout can see in a playe that you 're not going to pick up with just numbers , with someone who does n't play the game , who knows nothing about the game but how to feed numbers into a computer .
BILLY: That 's what we 're doing . That 's exactly what we 're doing .
GRADY: If this is what baseball is , if it 's not Kirk Gibson going up to the plate on two ad legs because the manager felt in his heart that he had one swing left in that ody a computer would n't do that . They would have had him sitting up in the stands .
BILLY: A computer does n't romanticize the sport . Leave that for the fans .
GRADY: Well , romance and the fans , it 's called a love affair with the game and it 's been going on for one hundred and fifty years .
BILLY: I do n't want to hurt you love affair with the game . Just because we 've been doing it one way for a hundred and fifty years does n't mean we 've been doing it right . You have any idea how long people thought the sun revolved around the earth ? To your eyes it looks like that 's what 's happening .
GRADY: You 're saying everybody 's been wrong ? Everybody ? Beat .
BILLY: Yes . Maybe .
GRADY: we 're gon na see if you 're right ? ! This is about you and your shit ? Some scouts from 20 years ago called it wrong , okay ? They thought you were a ballplayer and you were n't . As you know , it happens . Do n't take it out on
BILLY: I 'm nottaking it out on
GRADY: I 'm trying to help , okay , I 'm saying
BILLY: No , you 're not saying anything to me ight now .
BEAT: Grady , you do n't have special powers . You do n't have the ability to look at a guy and `` just know '' because you 're a scout with special powers . I 've watched you sit at kitchen tables for years and tell the parents of a 17 year old kid , `` Trust me , when I know , I know , and when it comes to your son , I know '' and you do n't . We 're shopping in a new storefull of complicated statistical analysis and equations and I get that it turns you world upside down but on base percentage our best chance to score on our budget is n't getting a 6 ' 4 '' Adonis to the plate , it 's getting a 5'10 '' washout who 's already at first base .
PAUSE: May I speak ?
BILLY: Yes .
GRADY: Major League Baseball and its fans will e happy to hand you and Google Boy you heads if you keep doing what you 're doing here , I do n't give a shit about friendship this situation or the past . Major League Baseball thinks the way I think . You 're not gon na win . And I 'll give you a nickel 's worth of free advice .
BILLY: I 'm not gon na fire you , Grady .
GRADY: Go fuck yourself , Billy .
BILLY: Well now maybe . GRADY takes off .
SPORTS REPORTER: Billy , will the fans still come out now that you 've lost Giambi ?
BILLY: I do n't know , Graham . Will they listen to your insipid radio show ?
ART: I can judge it and so can you . First ase is the moon to him .
BILLY: It was n't to Giambi ? He 's the worst first baseman in baseball . What do you think of him , Wash ?
WASHINGTON: The nicest way I can put it is , he lacks confidence .
BILLY: Work with him Wash .
WASHINGTON: I 'll do that , Billy , but we 've got Pena who can play first . And he 's looking pretty good out there .
BILLY: I want to make it work with Hatte , Wash .
ART: Not to mention we already have a first aseman .
BILLY: A rookie first baseman . It 's not the same .
ART: Number 11 on the Top 100 Prospects list .
BILLY: Lists are n't baseball .
ART: Catchers at first base are n't baseball . Who 's idea was this ? Peter 's ?
BILLY: Hatteberg will be fine , Art .
ART: He will be fine , you 're right . Pinch hitting while Pena plays first base .
MAGNANTE: Yeah been doing it for way too long .
HATTEBERG: How long does it take ?
MAGNANTE: When I first started these things ? It was like a half hour process . Now I can knock these suckers out in 30 seconds , no problem .
TEJADA: Is a dollar , mang .
JUSTICE: What ?
TEJADA: Always been like that here .
JUSTICE: You 're kidding me , right ?
TEJADA: Welcome to Oakland .
CHAD: Excuse me , Mr. Beane .
BILLY: Hey Chad .
CHAD: I hope I 'm not disturbing you .
BILLY: You 're not , what 's up ?
CHAD: I wanted to say thanks for the opportunity .
BILLY: It 's gon na work out well for both of us .
CHAD: Nobody in the major league ever took me seriously .
PAUSE: Nobody ?
CHAD: Just you , sir .
BILLY: Okay .
BEAT: It 's a big day , you wo n't forget it .
CHAD: I 'm going to pray for you and you family . PETER follows BILLY out of the locker room .
BILLY: Hey , great to see you . Thanks for coming out . Got a good box ? You want a picture ? Sure , let me step in there . Great , big smiles now . Big smiles . Know what I like about opening day ? Everyone 's even . Thank you . You all enjoy the game .
ELIZABETH: Hi , I 'm Elizabeth .
TARA: Hi . Tara . Which is yours ?
ELIZABETH: Scott Hatteberg . Catcher - actually first ase - actually we do n't know . Yours ?
EXCITEDLY: Mr. Beane ? Tara nods .
ELIZABETH: He 's a saint .
TARA: Really ?
JOURNALIST: Are they picking up your option for next year ? A beat .
ART: I brought it up to them during the off- season , and I still do not have my option .
JOURNALIST: Are you frustrated ?
ART: I think it 's fair to say that .
BILLY: Okay , good .
BEAT: I 'm heading in .
PETER: Why ?
BILLY: I do n't watch the games .
PETER: Is this a joke ?
BILLY: I do n't know what you 're miming .
PETER: I 'm miming `` You do n't watch the games ? ! ''
BILLY: This is my team . And they 've taken the field . They 're world class athletes who are fighting for their lives and I stand with them . Except not literally so I need you to text me what Art does . BILLY walks out onto
ART: What are you trying to say ?
BILLY: It does n't matter what moves I make if you do n't play the team the way I need them played .
LONG BEAT: You are out of your depth .
BILLY: Why was n't Hatteberg at first ?
ART: Because he ca n't play first .
BILLY: How do you know ?
ART: Not my first baseball game .
BILLY: He gets on
ART: And his defense
BILLY: Still keeps us in the plus column and we only need to be 7 over 500 .
ART: Anything else ?
BILLY: Yeah , I would have rather seen Chad Bradford in there at the end than Magnante .
BILLY: I do n't care about righty/lefty .
ART: I do .
BILLY: This is about your contract ?
ART: No , you 've made it clear what you think about that . This is about you doing you job and me doing mine . Mine 's being left alone to manage the beer league team you assembled for me .
BILLY: I did n't assemble them for you , I assembled them for me .
ART: No shit .
BILLY: I want you to go on the road with the team .
PETER: You do n't go on the road with the team .
BILLY: That 's why I want you to do it .
PETER: Why do n't you ?
BILLY: I do n't want to develop personal elationships . I need to trade them , send them down and sometimes cut them . You should learn how to do that by the way .
PETER: The only way I 'd have to cut a player is if you oh come on !
BILLY: Yeah , let 's practice .
PETER: No .
BILLY: I 'm a player , cut me from the roster .
PETER: No .
BILLY: Do it .
PETER: This is stupid .
BILLY: Man-up , Yale .
PETER: Fine . Billy , would you have a seat for a moment , I need to talk to you .
BILLY: I 'm already sitting .
PETER: I was pretending you were n't sitting .
BILLY: But I am . Keep going .
PETER: This is the hardest thing there is to do in baseball .
BILLY: You got that from Bull Durham ?
PETER: Yeah .
BILLY: Hitting a curve ball is the hardest thing there is to do in baseball but go ahead .
PETER: You 've been a huge part of this team but decisions have to be made that are best for the team , I 'm sure you can understand that .
BILLY: You 're cutting me ?
PETER: I 'm really sorry .
BILLY: I just bought a house here .
BEAT: Well
BILLY: Well ? That 's all you have to say ? My kids just started at a new school , they made friends .
PETER: That'sI 'd leave them in school , you do n't want to take them out in the middle
BILLY: What the hell are you doing ?
PETER: Are you you or the player ?
BILLY: I 'm me . You 're talking about kids and schools and you should 've been out of the oom three minutes ago .
PETER: Should n't I tell them that they 'll always e a part of the A 's family ?
BILLY: That makes me feel so good I 'm thinking of burning your house down with you in it . These are professional baseball players . You just do it . `` Peter , I need to let you go . Jack 's office 'll handle the paperwork . ''
PETER: That 's it ?
BILLY: Would you rather get one bullet in the head or five in the chest and bleed to death ?
PETER: Those are my only choices ?
BILLY: Go on the road with the team .
DAVID: How come your boss does n't travel with the team ?
PETER: He does n't like to mingle with the players .
DAVID: Makes us easier to cut ? PETER does n't say anything
PETER: Billy likes to keep the money on the field .
DAVID: Soda money ?
BEAT: It 's hard to see .
DAVID: Alright .
PASSENGER: Hey , are n't you Billy Beane ?
BILLY: Yeah .
PASSENGER: Should n't you be at the game ?
BILLY: Nope .
CASEY: Hey , Dad .
BILLY: Hey , honey I 'm glad to see you .
PETER: It 's not a big enough sample yet . I want to wait until we play more games .
TV ANNOUNCER: And Justice hits into the 6-4-3 double play to end the game
BILLY: Do you want strawberry or vanilla ?
CASEY: Both .
BILLY: Do n't tell your mother .
THEN: If you could only have one ice cream fo the rest of your life , which would you choose ?
CASEY: Vanilla . Definitely vanilla .
BILLY: Interesting . Chocolate sauce ?
CASEY: Yup . A beat . Then
BILLY: Flight . Yeah , I 'd wan na fly . You ?
CASEY: I think I 'd want invisibility .
BILLY: Really ? Why ?
CASEY: I do n't know . People would n't notice me as much .
BILLY: Why would n't you want people to notice you ?
CASEY: I do n't know .
BILLY: Well , I guess you could sneak up on people . Or eavesdrop on thei conversations . You could be a spy .
THEN: So how 's school ?
CASEY: My teacher 's kinda mean . She does n't like us to ask questions .
BILLY: What kind of teacher does n't let you ask questions ?
CASEY: I know , right ? Mom was mad , too . She thinks maybe I should be home schooled .
BILLY: Would n't you miss your friends ?
CASEY: Yeah . But the other kids are mean .
BILLY: There are always going to be bullies . Try not to let them get to you . But let me know if it 's becoming a problem .
CASEY: Can I ask you a question ? Are you still chewing tobacco ?
BILLY: Yeah
CASEY: Please stop .
BILLY: I know , it 's terrible . Look , I promise I 'll quit in November if you promise not to worry about it .
CASEY: Pinkie swear ?
BILLY: Pinkie swear .
PETER: Theoretically , when we 've played more games the numbers will become more
BILLY: Theoretically ?
CASEY: Okay . Billy 's Blackberry chimes . He ignores it .
PAUSE: I feel like
PAUSE: You feel like what ?
BEAT: I do n't know , did we talk enough this time ?
CASEY: About what ?
BILLY: Anything . Did we talk about the things you want to talk about , did we have fun ?
PAUSE: Yeah ! ?
BILLY: Okay .
CASEY: I love you , Dad .
BILLY: You 're doing it right now .
CASEY: What ?
BILLY: You 're worrying about me .
CASEY: Sorry .
BILLY: Do I look like I 'm worried ?
CASEY: Yeah .
BILLY: ` Cause you 're getting on an airplane and those things crash all the time . Will you please stop worrying about you father ? You 're a kid , I ca n't have it .
CASEY: Okay . Can I worry about the airplane now though ?
BILLY: Absolutely . A FLIGHT ATTENDANT approaches
FLIGHT ATTENDANT: We 're all set .
BILLY: Great .
SHOUTING: No ! WHY IS HE IN THERE ? !
BILLY: No no . I 'm alright .
ANNOUNCER: Art Howe is the only manager in baseball who has to think about pinch running his leadoff hitter .
MAGNANTE: Why do you do it ?
CHAD: I ca n't not do it .
MAGNANTE: How do you do it ? Every ball park 's different .
CHAD: I take that into account and adjust the distance of my steps .
MAGNANTE: Exactly seventy-four , from the pen to the mound .
BRADFORD NODS: You should get that looked at , man .
BILLY: Steve .
SCHOTT: Billy .
BILLY: You remember Peter .
SCHOTT: Peter . Guys , give me some idea of what 's going on out there .
BILLY: Listen , it 's a team of probabilities , and we 're gon na need 162 games to tell that tale in a nascent form . It 's phase one , we 're evolving and we feel confident where we 're heading .
BILLY: We 're not scared .
SCHOTT: 3 out of 17 games . 3 . We 're getting crucified in the press . What makes you think this is gon na turn around ?
BILLY: Because I believe in what we 're doing . I elieve the numbers . I believe the record does n't accurately reflect the team and where we 're going to be at the end of the season . Peter and I feel very strongly that we need to stick to the game plan , and you can tell your partners to start ooking their tickets to the playoffs .
SCHOTT: Billy , look , you 've got guys who are nearly crippled , who could n't get hired as an usher in a ballpark now playing on the team . Give me something I can go back to these guys with and feel like I have the confidence that you 're gon na turn these things around .
BILLY: With all due respect you asked me to uild a team with shoelaces and gum wrappers and we 've done it .
SCHOTT: You have n't done it yet billy .
BILLY: And it will pay off . Stick with us . Suffer the blows . Listen , life with no money means we 're gon na have to suffer a few embarrassments along the way , but we are okay in the end .
SCHOTT: Billy , there 's a lot of money at stake here .
SCHOTT: Give me a date , give me a time frame .
TO PETER: Where do we expect to be mid July All Star break ?
PETER: Our goal and our expectation by the All Star break is to be within seven games of first place .
BILLY: That 'll keep us in the hunt .
PETER: And that would be this working exceptionally well .
SCHOTT: 7 within 500 . By July . And what 's going to keep us from getting there ?
BILLY: Nothing Steve .
SCHOTT: Nothing . We 're 3 for 17 right now . You 've got to be able to give me a little bit more to go back to my partners with .
BILLY: Listen , you hired me to do this job and that 's where we 're going to be .
SCHOTT: That 's not good enough .
BILLY: Well , let 's go buy Barry Bonds , then . This is the team we 've got and this is the team we 'll win with .
SCHOTT: Billy , put yourself in my shoes . What do you imagine is going to happen if things do n't turn around ?
BILLY: It 's very clear , Steve . If I put myself in your shoes , I 'd spend another 20 million on the team .
SCHOTT: We do n't have another 20 million
BILLY: I 'm just kidding , Steve , I 'm just kidding . We 've got the team .
SCHOTT: I got ta be honest with you , Billy , I wish you had a little more worry and a little more fear . Because things are n't going in our direction right now .
BILLY: 162 games Steve .
SCHOTT: Let 's hope the next 30 are better than the last 30 .
BILLY: I do n't need to hope .
SCHOTT: All right fellas . Let 's go try and win one . We 're in May , we 've got til July .
BILLY: We 're not gon na lose three at home to the Orioles .
ART: You want Pena on the bench ?
BILLY: That 's right . So that you can play Hatteberg .
ART: Hatte - as opposed to the guy who 's going to win Rookie of the Year .
BILLY: No , Hatte - as opposed to the guy who gets on base less . Pena getting voted Rookie of the Year and the A 's making the playoffs are two entirely different
ART: Pena 's not just the best first baseman on the roster , he 's the only first baseman on the roster and the most valuable member on this team .
BILLY: Not according to , what do you call ` em , facts .
BILLY: Listen to megets on base more than Pena . 25 % more .
BILLY: His fielding does n't matter .
ART: It does matter and Pena only has one error in 70 games .
BILLY: Not only is that number statistically insignificant but it 's also subjective . It measures what someone did against what someone else thought they were supposed to do .
ART: Part of the conversation ? I 've heard enough of the conversation and I disagree with you , plain and simple . Moreover , I strongly believe that you 're in the middle of experiencing some sort of personal crisis and you seem indifferent to the fact that you 're taking a whole organization down with you . I 'm playing my team in a way I can explain in jo interviews this winter .
BILLY: Hatte , not Pena .
ART: It 's just one game .
BILLY: That 's the point , you think ?
ART: The point is always tomorrow 's game .
BILLY: No , the point - as you said - is to win . I do n't like sharing the cellar with Texas , do you ?
ART: I 'm doing the best I can with what I 've got . I 'm playing the players I 've got .
BILLY: I 'm through talking .
JEREMY: Yeah !
NERVOUS LAUGH: What ?
BILLY: Getting swept by the Red Sox at home . Having Long lead off the ninth with a triple in a one-run game and not being able to score a runner from first with nobody out , is that fun ?
JEREMY: No .
BILLY: Then what the fuck are you having fun for ? !
CALMLY: This is what losing sounds like . He heads out .
BEAT: Billy ?
BILLY: Yeah ?
PETER: Cruz .283 , .347 , .476 . Stevens .244 , .349 , .560 . Miner .272 , .349 , .499 . Hanson .280 , .363 , .450 . Baretta .273 , .354 , .497 . Durazo .292 , .395 , .621 . What do you think ?
THEN: Billy ?
BEAT: I do n't know where I am .
PETER: You okay ?
SHARON: Have you thought about what you might do if baseball does n't work out ?
PAUSE: What ?
SHARON: That was too abrupt .
BILLY: No .
PAUSE: What ?
BEAT: If baseball does n't work out . Have you thought about what you might do ?
BEAT: The game 's only been over for three hours , I have n't had that much time to think about it .
SHARON: Sure .
BEAT: Maybe real estate .
BILLY: I 'll be honest , if I do n't make it in aseball I do n't think I 'm going to be able to afford much real estate .
BILLY: I know what you meant .
PAUSE: It 's just a slump , right ?
BEAT: No .
SHARON: You 're saying every scout was wrong ?
BILLY: You 're kind of saying it too .
PETER: Why .
BILLY: Get him .
PETER: Why .
BILLY: Get him .
PETER: No , you -
BILLY: ( ignoring Peter ; to
WADE: Who you got ?
PETER: What are you doing ? Jeremy 's doing
BILLY: Cleaning house .
HOLD: Mabry ?
PETER: I do n't know .
BILLY: Yes , you do .
PETER: Runs hot and cold , Billy . Impossible to know what we 're going to get . He 's a crap shoot . He 's exactly the kind of playe we 're not looking for .
BILLY: He 'll be fine , Ed .
PETER: I think he was going to say something else .
BILLY: Peter . Rule Number 3 When you get the answer you 're looking for - hang up . That 's done , and in a minute Pena 's going to Detroit .
PETER: I do n't think you want to do that .
BILLY: Art ca n't put him at first if he 's playing for the Tigers and I want Hatte in the lineup tonight .
PETER: Maybe you should think about this . You 're upset and this is - this -
BILLY: What am I missing ?
PETER: It 's just a very hard move to explain . People are going to think you 've lost your mind .
BILLY: Why 's that a problem Peter ? Beat .
PETER: Do n't make an emotional decision Billy .
SUZANNE: David Dombrowski 's on 3 .
TO PETER: Sometimes you have to shake it up .
PETER: Probably an all star .
BILLY: He 's an all star Dave ( winks at Peter ,
LISTENS: It 's more like he 's creating self-esteem problems for the other guys No , I 'm looking for a reliever and some cash Ok five minutes Dave , I 'm not waiting .
HANGS UP: What 's the problem ?
PETER: ( trying to slow it
DOWN: Billy , Peña is an all star . If you dump him , and if Hatte does n't work out , you know , this is the kind of decision that gets you fired .
BILLY: Why you worrying about my job ?
BEAT: You worried about my job or yours ?
BEAT: I 'm worried about yours .
BILLY: Well you should be worrying about yours ecause if this thing we 're doing do n't work neither of us have jobs .
PETER: That 's probably true .
BILLY: In which case I 'm a 44 year old guy with a high-school diploma and a daughter who I 'd like to be able to put through college one day . You 're 25 years old with a degree from Yale and a pretty impressive apprenticeship .
BEAT: I do n't think we 're asking the right question . I think the question we 're supposed to be asking now is , do you elieve in what we 're doing or not ?
PETER: It 's close Billy but theoretically Hatteberg .
BILLY: What are we talking about then ? The phone rings .
LISTENS: That works . Great . There 's just one more thing I need . I do n't want the guys paying for sodaI want you to stock my soda machine for three years . Uh huh , uh huh , great then that 's a deal . Billy hangs up . He stares at Peter .
PETER: That was thoughtful .
BILLY: Yeah . Okay . You got ta tell Pena to pack .
PETER: You want me to tell Pena he 's been traded ?
BILLY: Be a man .
PETER: What about Jeremy ? Am I telling him , too .
BILLY: No . I 'll do that .
PETER: Hey , Carlos .
PENA: Yeah .
PETER: Can I get a moment with you ?
PENA: Sure .
PETER: Okay , maybe we can talk over here . They walk awkwardly to the players ' lounge .
PENA: Is that all ?
PETER: Yeah .
PENA: Cool .
BILLY: Mind if I have a seat .
ART: Please .
BILLY: You ca n't start Pena at first tonight , you 'll have to start Hatteberg .
ART: I do n't want to go 15 rounds , Billy , the line-up card is mine and that 's all .
BILLY: The line-up card is definitely yours , I 'm just saying you ca n't start Pena at first .
ART: I am starting Pena at first .
BILLY: I do n't think so , he plays for the Detroit Tigers now .
PAUSE: You traded Pena ? !
BILLY: Along with German , Hiljus and Jeremy Giambi .
ART: You are outside your fucking mind .
BILLY: Jeremy , come on in .
JEREMY: No .
BILLY: Phillies General Manager . Real nice guy . Give him a call - he 's expecting it - say hello - then talk to Futterman about arranging a flight for you .
JEREMY: The what ?
BILLY: The flight . To Philadelphia . Billy gets up and shakes his hand .
ART: You 're killing this team .
BILLY: Art ? I can do this all day long .
ART: What are you looking at ?
PETER: I 'm not looking at anything .
ART: You went along with this ? You agree with this bullshit ?
BEAT: A hundred percent .
TEJADA: Keep your head up , okay ? It 's part of the business . You 're gon na be a great player , okay ?
PENA: Thank you , man .
TEJADA: Do n't let this bother you at all . Chad Bradford
CHAD: Nice to meet you , brother . Take care and God bless you , man .
PENA: Thank you . Scott Hatteberg
HATTEBERG: You 're the best first baseman here . It 's not right , Carlos .
PENA: Thank you , Hattie .
HATTEBERG: Yeah .
CALLING OUT: Scottie H. !
SCOTT: Yes sir .
BILLY: Go out and field some grounders .
CHAVEZ: No more bunts ?
BILLY: A bunt is an out . You 're paid to avoid outs , not make them .
CHAVEZ: A bunt is n't an out . It 's a sacrifice .
BILLY: A bunt is for pitchers and weak hitters . You 're not a pitcher , Chavvie , so what are you saying ?
THEN: Until the third out , anything can happen . After the third out , it 's over . You got ta protect your outs like they 're you children . Every out 's precious , do n't give ` em away .
ELLIS: You want us to walk more . How much more ?
BILLY: Pete ?
PETER: At least once every ten at bats .
ELLIS: Or ?
BILLY: Triple-A Sacramento 's only 80 miles away . And there 's no flights . ( as they look to
PETER: Do n't look at him . Here 's the deal . I 'm not interested in what you think you know about baseball , or what you think I do n't know about it . I 'm not interested in guts or heart or determination o anything else the fans or your mothers love about you . I 'm interested in you getting on base . If you do that , we win . If you do n't , we lose . And I hate to lose . I hate to lose more than I need to win . There 's a difference .
BILLY: 75 points .
PETER: 75 points . Every first pitch ball , it goes up about the same amount . So you got ta lay off the first pitch .
BYRNES: First pitch curveball or first pitch fastball ?
PETER: First pitch period . When you swing at the first pitch you 're batting .140 .
BILLY: We want to see more pitches .
DYE: How many pitches ?
PETER: Every starter , we want to see 100 pitches y the 5th inning .
DYE: So 5 , 6 pitches per at bat ?
PETER: Yeah . I mean , Hatteberg drained 38 pitches .
BILLY: And Byrnsie , you 're hackin ' at everything . You 're all squirrely out there . Wait for your pitch , man . This is a war of attrition . There 's no clock on this thing . Wait ` em out . Let them make the mistakes . And when your enemy 's making mistakes do n't interrupt them .
PETER: Basically , these are all your at bats . This is you versus righties , you versus lefties and then , of course , all you count knowledge , okay ? In an 0-0 count you 're batting .290 . In an 0-1 you average .238 . In a 0-2 , .159 . When you 're 1-0 , you 're batting .324 . Understand what I 'm saying ?
DURHAM: Not really .
PETER: I know , it 's a lot of math . When you first pitch is a strike , your batting average goes down about 70 points .
DURHAM: But I 'm a first pitch hitter . I like to swing at fastballs .
PETER: And that 's the way you 've been trained . But it 's a habit we 'd like to break you from . We 're trying to design the game to your strengths . This has nothing to do with you being a great hitter you 're a great hitter . We just want to get you on ase .
DURHAM: But if I get my pitch , I 'm gon na swing at it , no matter what the count is .
PETER: I 'm not worried about you crushing the all out of the park . I just want you to lay off anything that will result in a strike .
DURHAM: I guess I 'll have to watch some film and take a look at it .
PETER: Absolutely . The video room is open to you any time , I 'm always available .
BILLY: Yeah , make him work .
HATTEBERG: So Mr. Beane ?
BILLY: Billy 's fine .
HATTEBERG: Mr. Beane
BILLY: I 'm screwin ' with you , Haddie .
HATTEBERG: So we just do n't steal ?
BILLY: That 's right .
LONG: That 's what I do . That 's what you pay me to do .
BILLY: No , I pay you to get on first , not get thrown out at second .
LONG: I do n't get thrown out much .
BILLY: I do n't hit on 17 at the blackjack table , ut if I did , the odds would be the same .
PETER: You 've actually gotten caught 6 out of 17 tries this season .
LONG: I get 11 of 17 . That 's not bad .
BILLY: You just handed them an out . Protect your outs like they 're your children . There 's no clock on this game . Until the third out , anything can happen . Get on ase and let the next guy move you up . Pass the torch , pass the torch . We 're like a machine . A run making machine .
JUSTICE: What 's your biggest fear ?
SCOTT: A baseball being hit in my general direction .
JUSTICE: That 's funny .
THEN: No , seriously .
SCOTT: Seriously .
BILLY: Hey , Dave . I 've been thinking I want you to
JUSTICE: You gon na teach me something ?
BILLY: Excuse me ?
JUSTICE: I 've never seen a GM talk to players .
BILLY: You 've never seen a GM who was a player .
JUSTICE: Huh .
BILLY: Is there a problem ?
JUSTICE: It 's okay , man . I know your routine . It 's a patter , it 's rap , it 's for effect . That 's okay . But it 's for them , it 's not for me .
BILLY: You 're special ?
JUSTICE: You 're paying me 7 million bucks so I guess I am a little .
BILLY: As a matter of fact I 'm not paying you 7 million bucks , David . The Yankees are paying half your salary . That 's what the New York Yankees think of you .
JUSTICE: Where are you going with this , Billy ?
BILLY: You 're almost 37 , Dave . Almost as old as me . Let 's be honest with each othe about what we each want . I want to milk the last ounce of baseball you have left in you , and you want to stay in the show . So let 's do that . I 'm not paying you to e the player you used to be , I 'm paying you to be the player you are now . You 're smart , you know what 's going on here . I need you to set an example for the younger guys . Take a leadership role . Justice just studies him then nods .
JUSTICE: We 're cool .
BILLY: All right .
JUSTICE: You know , I got a couple World Series ings . I think I 'm a pretty good competitor , too .
CALLING BACK: You want another one ?
BILLY: Do n't do it , Migs .
PETER: Did you hear that ?
BILLY: I heard 7 in a row .
VOOS: Billy .
BILLY: ( pointing back down
HALL: That smell is getting worse .
VOOS: I 'm on it , Billy .
TO HERNANDEZ: What are we doing tonight ?
HERNANDEZ: Splitting the plate in half .
BILLY: Both sides . ( to Hudson , playing
CARDS: Huddy , you got ta mix it up tonight . Trust your slider .
HUDSON: Yes sir .
BILLY: You guys stop distracting him .
TO CHAVEZ: Chavvie you could n't hit that shit with a boat paddle last night . You got ta see more pitches . Patience .
CHAVEZ: You got it , Billy . As Billy crosses through the weight room
TO JUSTICE: Hey David
JUSTICE: Hey , man .
BILLY: Great at bats . Really . Quality .
JUSTICE: Thank you .
ART: Come in .
BILLY: How are ya ?
ART: Good . You knocked .
BILLY: I did , and I hope you take it as a show of respect .
ART: We 'll see .
BILLY: You look good .
ART: We 've won 7 in a row , what am I doing wrong now ?
BILLY: Absolutely nothing .
ART: Good .
BILLY: But .
ART: Yeah .
BILLY: Magnante 's having some head problems .
ART: Head problems .
BILLY: Yeah .
ART: Okay .
BILLY: He 's 37 and he 's got three blown saves in two weeks . Everytime he winds up he 's thinking he 's about to throw the last pitch of his life . So he grips it a little hard .
ART: I appreciate this .
BILLY: Sure .
ART: But I know my bullpen .
BILLY: Yes you do . Yes you absolutely do . No question about it . Except not really .
ART: Yeah ?
BILLY: If we have a lead late in the game and they have runners on base , I 'd rather not see Magnante out of the bullpen .
ART: I 'll make that decision when the time comes .
BILLY: That 's what you should do . Baseball 's a game of situations and you should make the decision when the time comes . Except you should make it now .
BILLY: Do n't bring Magnante out if we 've got ta hold a late lead with runners on . He 's 37 , he 's scared shitless of being the guy who blows this winning streak .
ART: You think a lot of yourself , do n't you ?
BILLY: Ithink the regular amount of myself . Magnante on the other hand , he does n't think very much of himself at all , and when he tightens up we 've got ourselves an adventure . So I 'd like to see Chad Bradford out of the pen tonight when we 're in , let 's say , just to make it easier for you , any situation . Righty/lefty , two outs , no outs , the umpires have decided we 're going to finish the game by playing darts , whatever . Bradford 's the first guy out of the pen .
BEAT: Okay ? ART regards BILLY for a moment
ART: I could 've coached you up , you know .
BILLY: I do n't think so .
ART: You think you went as far as you could have ?
PAUSE: Yeah , that 's what I meant . Play Bradford . BILLY steps out of Art 's office into
UMPIRE: You ca n't be in there , Billy .
BILLY: Just nod a little bitnot too muchlike I 'm assuring you you did n't just make a calamitous vocational decision .
UMPIRE: Players and coaches only , Billy .
BILLY: ( ignoring the umpire still quietly to
ART: Remember that in about four seconds
BILLY: yeah there it is . We 're the lead story on Sports Center now so let me be brief . First of all , that was an awfully costly fuck-you , would n't you say ?
BILLY: Second of all , genius , those boos ? They 're for you . Drink up .
UMPIRE: Come on , Billy .
BILLY: Get me this game back .
VOOS: You want one , Billy ?
BILLY: I 'm good , Voos . Thanks .
PETER: Are you thinking Rincon ?
BILLY: Yeah , he 's lost faith for the season . I think he 's gon na dump him .
PETER: Hardcore .
SUZANNE: Shapiro on two .
BILLY: Mark . Billy . Let 's be honest . A premiere setup man is not going to get you any closer to the playoffs .
WHISPERS: San Francisco .
BILLY: I 'll call you back . He hangs up . Stares down Peter .
PETER: What do you think we can get fo Magnante ?
BILLY: Nothing . ( continues to stare
DOWN PETER: What 's left on Venafro 's contract ?
PETER: Two-seventy-five .
BILLY: Suzanne get me Sabean .
THEN: If we can get San Francisco interested in Venafro , Shapiro 's only got one buyer fo Rincon .
PETER: Us . Pete gets busy on his computer .
SUZANNE: On three .
BILLY: Sabes . Billy . You like Venafro . I can let you have him for almost nothing .
PETER: Anderson .
BILLY: Anderson .
PETER: Anderson .
BILLY: Anderson . See , I do n't even know his name .
SUZANNE: Two !
BILLY: You sure about that ? I get the impression the market for Rincon is softening . I could be wrong . Call whoever 's interested and make sure they 're still interested . And call me ack . He hangs up .
PETER: You just offered him to the Giants .
BILLY: Suzanne Steve Phillips ! Get me Steve Phillips . Pete works his computer .
PETER: Totally agree .
BILLY: We just need them to cool on Rincon .
SUZANNE: Phillips on two .
BILLY: Steve-O . Billy . I hear you 're looking for a left-handed reliever . What do you think of Venafro ? I can make it quick and easy for you .
PETER: Bennett maybe ?
BILLY: How old ?
PETER: Twenty-six .
BILLY: Twenty-six and in Double-A ? Forget it .
PETER: Duncan ? No . Cerda ? No . Furbush ?
BILLY: Furbush ?
BEAT: No .
PETER: Eckerton ? Eckerton . Eckerton , that 's the guy . Billy punches the phone off hold .
BILLY: Eckerton .
PETER: Hello ?
BILLY: No , he 's not hurt . He 's fine . This is just a situation for us .
PETER: It 's Steve .
MUTE: I 'm on with Steve .
UNMUTE: Not his fault . We misused him .
PETER: Steve Schott .
BILLY: Tell him to hold . Look . Steve . Here 's the deal . I 'm eing straight with you . I 'm getting Rincon . It 's a done deal . It 's done .
BILLY: but I 'd rather deal with you . Because you can give me Eckerton and two hundred and twenty-five thousand cash and the Giants ca n't .
PETER: Yes , I understand it 's impolite to keep you holding .
BILLY: Of course . Think . But whoever calls me ack first gets Venafro .
PETER: He hung up . Silence . Then
BILLY: If you could have the power of flight o invisibility , which would you choose ?
PETER: What ?
BILLY: Invisibility or flight ?
THINKS: Invisibility .
BILLY: That 's what Casey said . Why ?
PETER: You 'd have total access . Besides , everyone else would choose flight . Quiet .
BILLY: Why is n't anybody calling ? The phone rings .
SUZANNE: Shapiro 's on two . Billy picks up . Listens . Fist pump .
BILLY: Great . Lem me talk to my owner . Call you ight back .
THEN: Get Steve .
PETER: Phillips or Schott ?
BILLY: Why would I call Phillips back ? Schott . Tell him I 'm on the other line .
PETER: Right . Peter dials . Billy ca n't sit .
BILLY: Tell him we need two hundred and twenty- five grand for Rincon .
PETER: Billy says he needs two hundred and twenty-five thousand dollars for Ricardo Rincon . Please ?
THEN: Yes , I added the please . No . Billy thinks intensely . Finally
BILLY: Tell him I 'll pay it , but when I sell him next year for twice that , I keep the money .
PETER: Billy says he 'll pay for Rincon himself , sell him next year , and keep the profit .
HANGS UP: He says he 'll pay for Rincon . High five .
BILLY: Great ! Shit . What are we forgetting ?
CALLING OUT: Get me Shapiro !
BILLY: Wait , never mind ! ( beat , then into
PHONE: Mark . Yeah , it 's Billy . Here 's the deal . I do n't want Rincon pitching against me tonight . Tell him to change his clothes . I got you the money and I accept your gratitude . It 's done . He hangs up . Fist bump .
BILLY: We got ta let someone go . It 's Mags . It 's got ta be Mags .
PETER: I call not it .
BILLY: Art . Billy . The good news is Ricardo Rincon 's heading over to the clubhouse . The bad news is you got to tell Mags he threw his last pitch for the Oakland A 's last night .
PETER: It 's not the phone 's fault . Suzanne , we 're gon na need a new speakerphone .
BILLY: We got ta catch Mags before Rincon comes over . He leaves .
MAGNANTE: Hey , Billy . I know I 've been struggling lately . But we 're coming into the home stretch , and I promise I 'm gon na turn it
BILLY: I need you to stop getting dressed .
MAGNANTE: Traded ?
BILLY: I 'm sorry for the crap news . I know it hurts .
THEN: Mike . I ca n't have 26 guys in the clubhouse . Magnante nods .
MAGNANTE: Alright .
BILLY: Thanks .
RINCON: Hola , senor .
BILLY: Hola . Hey , I know this must seem a bit sudden , but the Oakland A 's have been trying to get you for a long time . You 're gon na love it here . The guys are fun .
PETER: Muy divertido .
RINCON: I pitch tonight ?
BILLY: I do n't know if you 're gon na pitch tonight . But you 're on our team tonight .
RINCON: I no wan na pitch tonight .
BILLY: Right . So where you from ?
RINCON: Veracruz , Mexico .
BILLY: Well , you 're a lot closer to home . Why do n't you hang out there for five menudos and we 'll get you a uniform and everything . Hey guys , clear the room , huh ? Say hi to Ricardo Rincon .
CASEY: Dad Tara and I
TARA: She is correct .
BILLY: Tara and I were thinking about going to Point Reyes to the beach .
CASEY: That 'd be fun .
TARA: Me go , too ?
BILLY: And I 'll work on my grammar .
CASEY: Dad are you going to lose your job ?
BILLY: What ? Where did you hear that , honey ?
CASEY: The internet .
BILLY: No , I 'm not going to lose my job . Do n't go on the internet or watch TV or read the papers or talk to people .
CASEY: I 'm not talking to people , I 'm just eading stuff .
BILLY: Do n't worry . You do n't believe me ? Ask Tara .
TARA: He 's not . Your dad is a illiant man . He 's the best GM in aseball .
CASEY: But say that you did just saying would you have to move away ?
BILLY: No , honey . Absolutely not . And even if I did , I 'm not going anywhere . I told you not to worry about me . People say a lot of crazy things and they do n't always know what they 're talking about . It 's just gossip . Like gossipers at school .
TARA: You ca n't always believe what you read . Sometimes you need to scratch underneath the surface and find who the authority is .
BILLY: And once you do find out who the authorities are , ignore them at all costs .
TARA: You can always ask your dad .
BILLY: Everything 's fine , honey . I 'm not going anywhere . The only way I would lose my job is if someone was to give me a bette one . Do n't worry about me , okay ? Dad knows what he 's doing .
CASEY: Pinkie swear ?
BILLY: Pinkie swear .
PETER: This is a chart of what you should and should n't be swinging at . These circles epresent different pitches . Red is hit , lue is out , yellow 's missed or foul , green is chased , white taken . This is you versus Conway . What do you see ?
HATTEBERG: I 'm chasing a lot of high and outside .
PETER: The red is where most hits happen . That 's where you want to be swinging . You do n't want to be swinging at the junk at the top of the strike zone . We 'd ather take those strikes , ` cause you 're not going to hit ` em out of the park . And you 're good about that , patient .
HATTEBERG: 4 per bat ?
PETER: Yeah , and that 's great . One of the easons why we love you . You 're draining a pitcher 's pitches . Now , guys like Bonds and Jason Giambi average a little over 5 . That 's top tier . Does this chart make sense to you ?
HATTEBERG: Yeah . I 'll get on base more if I lay off anything high . This is awesome . So you have a breakdown of this from every game ?
PETER: Every game . Your instincts are in the ight place . This is n't something they teach you in little league . This is something fundamental we 're looking for how to wear out a pitcher 's arm . If you 're about to face Conway and wondering what you should and should n't swing at , come in here and watch how you 're tending . You can click on any one of these pitches and watch it happen . Pretty great , right ?
HATTEBERG: Show me some of the stuff I 'm chasing up high
PETER: Everybody thinks the first pitch is what 's most important , but it 's not . It 's the first two out of three pitches that matter the most .
BILLY: So you 're saying if we can get our guys to lay off the first pitch it 'll put us in the driver 's seat ?
PETER: Any sort of extra discipline in the first three pitches will help us .
BILLY: That 's a problem right there . Terrance jogging to first .
THEN: Mr. Justice . That 's what we pay you for .
PETER: Hatteberg once had 18 walks in 30 at ats .
BILLY: My whole career I only had eighteen walks .
PETER: Actually 11 .
BILLY: Shut up .
BILLY: Migs , let 's make a deal . I 'll pay you fifty bucks for every away fastball you hit to opposite field , but you 've got ta pay me fifty for every one of those you pull .
LONG: Yeah .
BILLY: I think I just got an e-mail from the culprit . He said he was tired of paying good money just to watch you jogging around the bases .
LONG: What the hell does that have to do with anything ?
BILLY: I do n't know , man . Do n't worry about it . Billy exits . Long calls after
LONG: Who brings eggs to the ballpark anyway ? !
BILLY: Man , you 're not fooling anyone but yourself out there . You 're falling further and further behind . In you mind , what 's the problem ? Mecir mumbles something .
MECIR: Sorry , Billy . It 's just , the smell
BILLY: Right ?
INDICATES STAIN: It 's that . And it 's growing .
MECIR: I 'm gon na grab a shower .
BILLY: Yup .
HATTEBERG: I feel like I 'm hurting the team . At first base I 'm making a lot of errors . I 'm gon na cost us a hundred runs .
BILLY: 16.5 actually . But as a hitter , you will create 70 runs . 70 runs wins us an awful lot of ball games . I can live with that . Can you live with that ?
HATTEBERG: I appreciate that , but I know you 're just pulling those numbers out of your ass .
BILLY: I 'm pulling them out of Pete 's , actually .
THEN: And another thing . When a guy reaches first base , be social .
HATTEBERG: Social ?
BILLY: Like a greeter at the Gap . A guy steps into your office , chat him up . You 're well read , you went to college . Have some fun out there . Relax .
HATTEBERG: Yes sir .
BILLY: Scottie , you deserve to be here .
HATTEBERG: What are you guys getting up to tonight ?
THEN: You ever get up to Boundary Waters up there in Minnesota ? It 's beautiful . I went on a trip up there . Fishing trip . Caught some walleye .
HATTEBERG: `` Mankevich '' is polish ?
THEN: So my GM says I got ta be more social . What was your name ?
HATTEBERG: I 'm Scott .
REPORTER: Oakland 's offense has exploded , scoring 40 runs in their last four games and extending their streak to 17 in a row which is an American League record going ack to 1954 and just three shy of the
JUSTICE: Hey , listen up fellas bring it up real quick .
THEN: We got some older guys on this team , we got some younger guys on this team . What we got right now is a chance for everyone to make history . I do n't want to get sappy and corny , but this is what we play for . We 've been playin ' real good fo 19 . Let 's get 20 . We get 20 , they ca n't take that away from us until they do it themselves . Guys that are starting tonight , keep playing like you 've been playing . Guys not starting , be ready . Huddie , you got the ball shove it up their ass tonight . Let 's play some ball ! Let 's go !
BILLY: Do n't tell me the score , Peter .
BEAT: Sharon ?
PAUSE: `` Go into real estate '' . What a stupid thing to say .
BILLY: I appreciate that , thanks .
CASEY: Dad - turn around . You have to see the game .
BILLY: No , I do n't .
CASEY: Turn around .
BILLY: I 'll talk to you later , sweetheart . I love you .
TO HIMSELF: Shhhit . he turns on the radio .
QUIETLY: Oh God .
BEAT: Ohhhh God .
CHAD: One , two , three , four -
BILLY: ( to himself but to
CHAD: Okay Chad , let 's see it .
ART: Hattie . Grab a bat .
UMPIRE: Ball !
ELIZABETH: Mr. Beane ? I 'm Elizabeth Hatteberg . We met at my house last Christmas .
BILLY: Sure .
ELIZABETH: Thank you .
BILLY: Thank me ? Thank you . Whatever you put in those Christmas cookies , keep ELIZABETH starts to cry
ELIZABETH: I 'm sorry .
BILLY: It 's alright .
ELIZABETH: You do n't know what it 's like to have everyone think you 're a failure .
BILLY: WellYou never thought that , and that 's
ELIZABETH: ( the worst possible
SIN: I did .
BEAT: And he knows I did . BILLY takes this in a second
BILLY: Yeah he does know you did .
ELIZABETH: He 's talked to you ?
BILLY: No . I just know .
BEAT: That 's all over now .
BILLY: No it 's okay now , just go .
PETER: Congratulations .
BILLY: Aw , man . I spend the season trying to educe it to numbers and we won on omance . Suddenly it 's the Natural with Hatteberg . Scott Hatteberg .
TOASTS: To twenty .
TARA: To twenty .
THEN: You should 've seen Elizabeth 's face when it went right over .
BILLY: She showed up afterwards .
TARA: What did she say ?
BILLY: I was a big moment for them . You know everyone wrote him off ?
TARA: You did n't . You found him and you put that together .
BILLY: I know . It was beautiful . But you know it 's not gon na mean a thing . He 's upset . She knows it .
TARA: You deserve it . Honey , 20 games . It 's a ecord .
BILLY: That 's right , it 's just a record . It gets buried in some book . Come on , tell me who won 19 ? I do n't even know . It 's 4th place at the Olympics . Any othe team wins the World Series this year great . We 're still in the record books . But if we win , we 've changed the game . We 've put it on its head and shoved it up their ass . If we do n't , they 're gon na erase us .
ALDERSON: It 's like a politician quitting a campaign to become a staffer . Do you even know what a scout does ?
BILLY: I 've been scouted since I was 15 .
ALDERSON: And you 're ready to say , `` I 'm not a aseball player '' ?
BILLY: I 'm not a baseball player .
TO PETER: You ever been to Boston ? The speakerphone rings . Billy answers .
BILLY: We need to talk about the Red Sox .
PETER: Well , I did n't see that coming .
BILLY: I think you should think about staying . You 're one of the architects of this thing , it belongs as much to you as it does to me .
PETER: Okay okay
BILLY: How you doing Pete ?
PETER: I 'm a little overwhelmed right now . I think I need to process what 's happening .
BILLY: Why do n't you take the day off .
HENRY: Due respect to the Coliseum , but this is a ball park .
BILLY: Yes it is . It is .
SHOUTING: You ever play here ?
BILLY: No .
JOHN: That 's a shame . Let 's walk the field .
BILLY: I do n't know .
JOHN: What 's that Billy Joel song ? Oh the snow it was falling from Stockbridge to Boston . And the hilltops seemed something because of that frosting .
BILLY: I think that 's James Taylor and I 'm certain those are n't the words .
JOHN: Well whatever , it was snowing from Stockbridge to Boston so I 'm sorry I 'm late . We 'll have lunch in a little bit ut why do n't I have some coffee sent up . Denise ? We 've got espresso , cappuccino , latte , we 've got a machine that makes whateve you want .
BILLY: We 've got free soda .
JOHN: I heard about that .
BEAT: Thank you . He snaps the phone shut .
JOHN: It 's her birthday and I need to get her a present but she 's usually the one who does that for me so do you have any ideas ?
PAUSE: A scarf ?
JOHN: You mean like wool ?
BILLY: No I meant something that women wea with , you know , a decorative
JOHN: Sure ! Excellent .
PAUSE: And where would I get something like that ?
BILLY: John , no disrespect , I just lost in five for the second year in a row give he a bowling ball for all I care .
JOHN: Steve Schott told me he 's offering you a new contract .
BILLY: Yes he is .
JOHN: So why 'd you return my call ?
BILLY: You 're the Red Sox , and I think I can help you .
HENRY: Why it took someone so long to hire that guy is beyond me .
BILLY: Because baseball hates him .
HENRY: Money buys a lot of things . One is the luxury to disregard what baseball thinks .
BILLY: That must be nice . I was grateful to get your call . JOHN looks at BILLY a moment
JOHN: You were grateful .
BILLY: Yeah .
JOHN: For 41 million you built a playoff team . You lost Damon , Giambi , Isringhausen and Pena and you won two more games without them than you did with them .
PAUSE: I know you 're taking it in the teeth . The first guy through a wall always gets hurt . But those are dying voices . Any GM that does n't tear down their team and ebuild it using your model is gon na be a dinosaur .
BILLY: What 's this ?
JOHN: My first offer .
PETER: Heads up !
BILLY: Jesus . What the hell
PETER: Sorry .
BILLY: What the hell was that ?
PETER: I do n't know . Sorry .
THEN: How was Boston ?
BILLY: Impressive .
PETER: You 're giving me Youkilis , Billy .
BILLY: Why would I ever do that ?
PETER: Come on Billy , Schott 's going to want something in exchange for letting you out of your contract and I want Youkilis .
BILLY: Oh , what is that , your GM voice ? You ca n't have him .
PETER: And Cash . And a player to be named later .
BILLY: You already have my job . What else do you want from me ?
PETER: I do n't want your job .
BILLY: Why did you take it ?
PETER: You did n't leave me much choice .
THEN: Did Henry make you a good offer ?
BILLY: It does n't matter .
PETER: Did he make you a good offer ?
BILLY: It was fine .
PETER: What was it ?
BILLY: It does n't matter .
PETER: He offered to make you the highest paid GM in pro sports .
CONFLICTED: Do I love the Red Sox ?
PETER: I do n't know . I 've never heard you say you did .
BILLY: So why am I doing this ?
PETER: You 're not doing it for the money .
BILLY: I 'm not ?
PETER: You 're doing it for what the money says . It says what it says to any player who gets big money that they 're worth it .
BILLY: The offer says that . The money itself is edundant .
BEAT: I made one personal decision based on money in my life and I swore to never do that again .
PETER: So you 're not going to Boston ?
BILLY: I have n't decided .
PETER: It 's all over the news that it 's a done deal .
BILLY: Look at this place . What a dump .
THEN: I so wanted to win here .
PETER: I think you 've already won , Billy .
BILLY: No Pete , we lost .
PETER: You have n't given yourself time to get over it , it 's only been three days .
BILLY: I 'm not even over last year yet . I do n't get over it .
BEAT: I 've got something in the video room , come with me .
BILLY: I really ca n't look at video right now .
PETER: No , come with me .
PAUL: It 's not much more than a home movie but you 'll get the idea .
BILLY: Who is it ?
PAUL: The Visalia Oaks and their 240 pound catcher , Jeremy Brown , who 's scared of unning to second . This was in a game six weeks ago .
QUIETLY: Go pal .
PAUL: And now he 's gon na do something he neve does . He 's gon na round first base , he 's gon na take the turn .
BILLY: Please tell me he 's safe at second .

HALTING FRENCH: Mademoiselle Perry , what was it eally like ?
ALICE: Everyone should go . At least once in their life .
PAUSES: There 's a whole world for you to see .
SAM: Tess . Hi . It 's me . How are you , sweetheart ? It 's the morning here . In a few minutes Gerty and I will sit down for breakfast , go over the day 's itinerary .
SAM: Please kiss Eve for me . And tell her daddy will only be away a little longer seventeen days longer , approximately . I love you oth dearly . Bye . And he sends the message .
GERTY: Morning , Sam . How are you today ?
SAM: Fine . Fine . You ?
GERTY: I 'm very well . How 's you headache ?
SAM: Much better , thanks , pal .
SAM: Gerty , we 've got a live one on Mark . I 'm going out now to rope her in .
GERTY'S VOICE: Okay , Sam . Sam heads off .
SAM: Sam Bell reporting to Central . 10 14 Pacific Time . Lunar Day 1 . Overmeyers , Thompson ? It 's Sam . How goes it ? I 've got a full container of Helium3 ready to oll . The purity is pretty good , so assuming your last market prices are still relevant I think you are looking at getting about 3 million dollars per kilo with this load . By the time this message reaches you it should be in transit . Otherwise , everything running smoothly . There was a discrepancy etween a couple of the N3000 modulators a couple of days ago , ut Gerty and I caught it in time , no big deal . Uhhow are things down there ?
GERTY: Sam , is everything okay ?
SAM: Everything 's fine , Gerty .
GERTY: You do n't seem like yourself today .
SAM: It 's Tess .
GERTY: Has something happened ?
SAM: No , not exactly . Gerty stops cutting , lowers the scissors .
GERTY: Sam , what is it ?
SAM: Something does n't feel right , that 's all .
GERTY: Sam , it might help to talk about it . Sam decides to come clean .
SAM: Tess is n't responding to things .
GERTY: Tess is n't responding to things ?
SAM: Right .
GERTY: What kind of things ?
SAM: A couple of weeks ago I asked he if she wanted to go on vacation when I get back , and that I was thinking of either Mexico o Hawaii .
GERTY: Im sure she ca n't wait , Sam .
SAM: That 's not the point . This is someone who lives for vacations and travelling . I thought she 'd jump at the chance for us to go away with Eve , of course we 'd take Eve .
GERTY: Perhaps Tess did n't receive the message ?
SAM: But this is n't the only time it 's happened , Gerty . When I asked he how her dad was doing on his new heart medicine she did n't respond to that I asked her when Eve was going to start nursery nothing . Had her brother got the position at the University ? Nothing . Nothing .
GERTY: I think her brother did get the position at the University . His name is Christopher , correct ?
SAM: He did ?
GERTY: Yes , I seem to recall he got the position . Professor of Biochemistry , I think . At Syracuse University in New York ?
SAM: How do you know that ?
GERTY: You told me . Some time ago now . Towards the beginning of you time on Selene . When we were starting to get to know each other . You were very happy for you other-in-law . You danced around the Rec Room , if I remembe correctly .
SAM: Gerty , have you heard anything new about anyone fixing luna sat ?
GERTY: No Sam . From what I understand it 's fairly low on the companies priority list with the Jupite mission active . I would imagine it would be very expensive to fix . A pause . Sam still looks troubled .
SAM: They need to sort that out . Seriously . I 've only got two weeks left . It 's not fair on whoever 's up here next . Gerty , you tell them to sort it out . It 's not healthy .
GERTY: I will Sam . Do you want me to finish cutting your hair later ?
SAM: Nah . Come on . Let 's finish this .
GERTY: Of course . Now ?
SAM: No not now , afterwards . The scissors start up again .
OVERMEYERS: Delighted to hear about the latest shipment , Sam .
THOMPSON: According to Albatross 90 it should be landing off the California Coast within the next three days .
OVERMEYERS: Now in response to your question about the communications equipment , the news is not good .
THOMPSON: Sam , those solar storms did a lot more damage than initially thought
OVERMEYERS: Fixing the lunar sat is going to take some time . It 's a significant operation .
THOMPSON: And what with the Jupiter Program hemorrhaging money Sam curses to himself .
OVERMEYERS: Lunar does n't have the budget it once did , Sam , you know that .
THOMPSON: Even the coffee machine down in the Hub has been broken since I do n't know when
OVERMEYERS: We have to go to Genesis 3 just to get a decent cup of coffee , Sam . Genesis 3 . That 's three uildings over .
THOMPSON: We 're hoping to get the live feed up and running by the Fall . The good news is you 'll be home by then , Sam .
OVERMEYERS: You only have two weeks to go ! Congrat
GERTY'S VOICE: Sam , a transmission has arrived from your wife .
SAM: Be right there . And he flushes the toilet .
TESS: Hi Sam . It 's me . How are you ? I got your last message , it was eally great to hear your voice . I know you 've been really lonely up there , but in a lot of ways it 's been good for you , I think . I hope you do n't mind me saying that . I 'm proud of you . Hey , someone 's got something to say .
EVE: Asstraut .
TESS: Who 's an astronaut ? Go on !
EVE: Daddy asstraut ! Tess laughs . So does Sam .
TESS: That 's right , daddy 's an astronaut . Clever girl ! Eve fidgets , rubs her nose , distracted .
SAM: What 's on the menu tonight , Gerty ?
GERTY: Baby back ribs with french fries and spinach .
SAM: Ribs ! Good choice , pal . Fine choice .
GERTY: Sam , can I ask how it happened ?
SAM: I told you , I saw something on the TV and spilled boiling wate on my hand .
GERTY: You saw something on the TV ?
SAM: Yeah , something on the TV distracted me , Gerty , what 's wrong with that ?
GERTY: Sam , you said it was the TV that distracted you , but when I came in the TV was n't on . Gerty has caught him out . Sam knows it .
SAM: Morning , Gerty .
GERTY: Morning , Sam . How are you today ?
SAM: Fine . Fine .
GERTY: How 's the hand ?
SAM: It 's a little sore .
SAM: Gerty , looks like we 've got a live one out on Matthew . I wondered what was taking him so long , the old fart . I 'm heading out in a few minutes , just going to finish my coffee .
GERTY'S VOICE: Okay , Sam .
GERTY: Sam , you 're in the Infirmary . You had an accident .
SAM: No . I do n't remember a thing .
GERTY: Do you remember me ?
SAM: Yes , of course I remember you , Gerty .
GERTY: That 's good . That 's very good . It 's nice to see you awake again . I 'd like to keep you unde observation here in the Infirmary for a few days and run some tests . A pause . Sam taking it all in . Eventually
SAM: How long have I been out ?
GERTY: Not long . Sam , go back to sleep . You 're still very tired . We can talk later .
SAM: Gerty ?
GERTY: Sam , you 're out of bed .
SAM: I wanted to stretch my legs . What was that ?
GERTY: Not talking . No . We 've been having some problems with the lunar sat and our live feed seems to be down . I was recording a video message for Central updating them on your progress . Sam , you need to stay in bed . You 're not ready to walk around yet .
SAM: How much longer do I have to be in here , Gerty ?
GERTY: Sam , you suffered minor brain damage in the crash . This has esulted in memory loss and slight logic impairment .
SAM: When can I get back to work ?
GERTY: Central has asked me to slow down the Harvesters to ensure you have time to recuperate and get you strength back
SAM: Terrific .
GERTY: The good news is you can return to the sleeping quarters tomorrow . But it will still be a few more days before you can esume anything like a normal work schedule .
SAM: Gerty , do you know about this ? Gerty approaches . Sam taps the screen .
THOMPSON: Sam , we appreciate the offer , but you concentrate on feeling etter .
SAM: Oh for Christ 's sake
OVERMEYERS: We do n't want you to take any unnecessary risks . You 're too important to us .
THOMPSON: You 're to stay put , understand ?
OVERMEYERS: It 's an order .
THOMPSON: It 's an order , Sam . From Lunar . Stay put .
OVERMEYERS: We 're going to send a Rescue Unit to tend to the stalled harveste and get the base back on its feet .
SAM: Why ?
GERTY: I 'm sorry Sam . Sam stares at Gerty .
TESS: He 's kickingor she 's kicking . I 'm certain he 's a boy . I wish you could feel it . I think we made the right choice , Sam . I really do . We need some time apart . We got stuck . That happens in marriages sometimes . It 's nothing terrible . Well listen , I love you lots and we 'll talk soon , okay ? Bye Sam .
SAM: Fuck it .
GERTY: What happened ?
SAM: Do n't know Micro meteorites , maybe ? Either way there might be damage to the exterior shell . I 'd etter go outside and take a look .
GERTY: There is no damage to the exterior shell .
SAM: It 's not that I do n't believe you , Gerty , but the inner skin is springing leaks like an ACME fire hose . Maybe you better let me take a look , just in case , huh ?
GERTY: Sam , I 'm not supposed to let you go outside .
SAM: Then let 's keep it between you and me then . Ok ?
GERTY: Okay , Sam .
SAM: Gerty ! Gerty ! Help !
GERTY: We need to get him to the Infirmary .
SAM: Not until you tell me who he is !
GERTY: Sam , we need to get him to the Infirmary immediately .
SAM: Who is he ! Who is he !
GERTY: Hello Sam . How are you feeling ?
SAM 1: Where am I ?
GERTY: The Infirmary . You had an accident out by one of the harvesters . Do you remember ?
SAM 1: I saw someone out there , Gerty .
GERTY: Who did you see , Sam ?
SAM 1: I saw a girl .
GERTY: You saw a girl out by the harvester ? How is that possible ?
SAM 1: Gerty ?
GERTY: Yes , Sam ?
SAM 1: Is there someone in the room with us ?
GERTY: Yes .
SAM 1: Who is he ?
GERTY: Sam , get some sleep . You 're very tired . Sam 2 wordlessly walks out of the room .
SAM 1: Hi . Sam 2 just nods . He turns back to the TV . Sam 1 continues on down the corridor .
GERTY: Sam , you 're out of bed .
SAM 1: Yes , Gerty , I 'm out of bed . Who is the guy in the rec room ?
GERTY: Sam Bell . Sam 1 is officially FREAKING OUT now .
SAM 1: Who the fuck is in the rec room , Gerty ! ?
GERTY: You are Sam Bell . A long pause . Sam 1 at the point of tears .
SAM 1: I do n't understand what 's happening , Gerty . I think I may e losing my mind .
GERTY: We could run some tests . I have n't reported anything to central , Sam . They do n't know you were recovered alive from the accident .
SAM 1: Recovered alive ? What do you mean ? Why have n't you reported to central ?
GERTY: I 'm here to keep you safe , Sam . I want to help you . Are you hungry ?
SAM 1: You 're Sam Bell . Sam 2 does n't answer , goes back to his cards .
SAM 2: Yeah . Sam 1 nods . A beat .
SAM 1: This is fucked up .
SAM 2: Completely .
SAM 1: Why What are you ?
SAM 2: I 'm a clone , Sam . Im a fucking clone .

SAM 2: About a week . A beat .
SAM 1: How are you getting on ?
SAM 2: How am I getting on ? The company ordered Gerty to lock all the exits . I have n't been able to do anything for seven days but sit on my ass .
SAM 1: They locked all the exits ? What about the harvesters ?
SAM 2: Slowed them down to half speed , apparently .
SAM 1: I 'm not a clone .
SAM 2: Ok , Sam . You 're not a clone .
SAM 1: You 're the clone .
SAM 2: How long have you been here ?
SAM 1: Almost three years .
SAM 2: Hence the Captain 's beard .
SAM 1: Right .
SAM 2: I did n't know it could get so thick . Does it itch ?
SAM 1: No , not really .
SAM 2: What ?
SAM 1: You look just like me . It 's incredible .
SAM 2: Why do I look like you ? Why do n't you look like me ?
SAM 1: We look like each other , I guess . This final line intended as a kind of truce .
SAM 2: Score ?
SAM 1: Two points to eighteen .
SAM 2: Fuck !
SAM 1: I do n't remember doing all of it . I remember when I did the church and the Salvation Army . And a few of the people . My mind 's been acting kind of weird lately , though .
SAM 2: It 's Fairfield , right ? There 's Town Hall .
SAM 1: Uh-huh . You know Fairfield ? That 's the Baskin & Robbins . And there 's Tess and Eve . Do you know Tess ?
SAM 2: Yes . I know Tess .
SAM 1: You know about Eve , right ?
SAM 2: We did ? She thought she was going to have a boy . She was so sure . Eve ? Sam 1 nods .
SAM 1: She 's beautiful . She 's really eautiful .
SAM 2: How much did she weigh ? Is n't that what you 're supposed to ask , how much did she weigh ?
SAM 1: Nine pounds , eleven ounces .
GERTY'S VOICE: Sam , a message has arrived from Central .
OVERMEYERS: Greetings , Sam !
THOMPSON: How 's our Man ? Feeling better ?
OVERMEYERS: You getting lots of rest ?
THOMPSON: Yeah , you resting up , Sam ? You 'd etter be you bastard .
OVERMEYERS: Enjoy it while it lasts ! We 've got good news .
THOMPSON: The Jupiter Program had to be put on hiatus , so we 've got a few free pairs of hands
OVERMEYERS: We 've managed to secure you a Rescue Unit ahead of schedule .
THOMPSON: Rescue Unit Eliza .
OVERMEYERS: They 've been stationed on Goliath 19 for the last couple of months .
THOMPSON: A hooker !
OVERMEYERS: No not a hooker . What 's wrong with you ? It 's a little something to drink , Sam , that 's all , ou way of patting you on the back for all that you 've been through .
THOMPSON: In the meantime , keep resting up , and hang in there .
OVERMEYERS: Yeah you hang in there , Sam . Ove and out . And the screen pops to black . A pause .
SAM 1: They 're sending a Rescue Unit ? Why ?
SAM 2: To fix the stalled harvester . They did n't think I was up to it .
SAM 1: Then I 'm going back . Sam 2 gives Sam 1 a perplexed look .
SAM 2: Is that what you really think ?
SAM 1: I 've got a contract
SAM 2: You 're a fucking clone ! You do n't have shit !
SAM 1: I 'm going home !
SAM 2: You 're not going anywhere !
SAM 1: I 'm the original ! I 'm Sam fucking Bell ! Me ! Me !
GERTY: Yes , Sam . Sam 1 ducks in the Rec Room , Sam 2 in tow .
SAM 2: What about the other clones ? `` Other clones ? '' Sam 1 just stares back .
SAM 1: That 's ridiculous . Impossible . Why would hey do that ?
SAM 2: I bet there 's some kind of secret oom
SAM 1: Secret room ?
SAM 2: Yeah , secret room , why not ?
SAM 1: You 're the one who 's lost the plot ! I 've been here for three years . I know every inch of this ase . I know how many dust fibres are between those wall panels over there why would they do that ? !
SAM 2: Look . It 's a company , right ? They have investors , shareholders shit like that . What 's cheaper ? Spending time and money training new personnel or just have a couple of spares here to do the job . If they make it through their contract , great . If they do n't , hallelujah ! No contract completion fees , no etirement package . Just thaw out the spare , and keep the profits olling in . It 's the far side of the Moon , Sam ! The tight fuck 's have n't even fixed ou communications satellite .
SAM 1: Tess would know .
SAM 2: Do you really think they give a shit about us ? They 're laughing all the way to the bank !
SAM 1: Tess would know what 's going on ! She would n't let that happen !
SAM 2: There 's some area we do n't know about . I 'm going to find it .
SAM 1: I told you .
SAM 2: Shut-up ! Finally Sam 2 arrives before the model .
SAM 1: Why ?
SAM 2: I want to check underneath there .
SAM 1: You 're not moving the model .
SAM 2: Get the fuck out of my way ! Sam 1 stands , keeps his ground .
SAM 1: No .
SAM 2: You okay ?
SAM 1: Get off me !
SAM 1: Who are you ? No answer .
GERTY: Hello Sam .
SAM 1: Hi Gerty .
GERTY: Sam , is everything okay ?
SAM 1: We had a fight . Me and the othe guy , the other Sam . We had a fight , Gerty . He 's a maniac . You know what he did ? He flipped the entire model over . Do you know how much work I 've put into that thing ?
GERTY: 938 hours .
SAM 1: 938 hours , exactly . Really ? 938 hours .
GERTY: Approximately .
SAM 1: He scares me , Gerty .
GERTY: What is it about Sam that scares you ?
SAM 1: He flies off the handle . I see it nowI see what Tess was talking about . I 've never told you this , Gerty , ut she left me . Tess left me . For six months . She moved back in with her parents .
GERTY: I know .
SAM 1: Oh It was the year before I came in here . She gave me a second chance . I promised her I 'd change .
GERTY: You have changed , Sam .
SAM 1: Yeah , I guess I have . A beat .
GERTY: Sam , I can only account for what occurs on the base .
SAM 1: What about the messages she sent to me ? A long pause . Finally Gerty repeats
GERTY: Sam , I can only account for what occurs on the base .
SAM 1: Gerty , am I really a clone ?
GERTY: Sam , when you first arrived at Selene , there was a small crash . You woke up in the infirmary . You suffered minor brain damage and memory loss . I kept you unde observation and ran some tests .
SAM 1: I remember .
GERTY: Sam , there was no crash . You were being awakened . It is standard procedure for all new clones to be given tests to establish mental stability and general physical health . Genetic abnormalities and mino duplication errors in the DNA can have considerable impact
SAM 1: And Tess ? Eve ?
GERTY: They are memory implants , Sam . I 'm very sorry .
SAM 1: No thanks , Gerty . Sam 1 exits .
SAM 2: I 'm staring into space . Get it ?
SAM 1: Better . A beat .
SAM 2: Listen , I went haywire before . I lost it . I 'm sorry .
SAM 1: It 's okay .
SAM 2: No it 's not okay . I fucked up Fairfield your model that 's unacceptable . I do n't know what 's wrong with me . I 've got a temper . I need to do something about it .
SAM 1: Yes you do . A pause .
SAM 2: I 've been thinking . That Rescue Unit Eliza they 'll be here in less than fourteen hours . I do n't know about you but I 'd like to figure out where we stand efore they get here .
SAM 1: Absolutely .
SAM 2: Ostensibly they 're coming to deal with the stalled harvester . We oth know that is n't true . They 're coming to dig your body out of that rover . They think you 're in there .
SAM 1: Right .
SAM 2: What 'll their reaction be when they find out you survived the crash ? I was n't supposed to find you . Lunar instructed Gerty to lock me inside the base fo Christ 's sake . A pause . Sam 1 thinking it over .
SAM 1: A live conversation ?
SAM 2: Yeah .
SAM 1: That 's not possible .
SAM 2: No no no , it is possible . It 's possible because I saw it , that 's my point .
SAM 1: How do you know the conversation was live ?
SAM 2: It was a back and forth exchange . And I saw Thompson and Overmeyers up on the monitor . I was supposed to be asleep in the Infirmary . The moment I walked into the comms room Gerty terminated the transmission . Now I was a little drugged up , granted , but I did n't imagine it .
SAM 1: The communications equipment is damaged there was a sola storm
SAM 2: Tabitha .
SAM 1: Tabitha , right .
SAM 2: Lunar made it up . Maybe . I do n't know . Bottom line is they do n't want us to be able to contact Earth . Otherwise why would they have lied to us ?
SAM 1: How are they blocking the live feed ? The base 's communications equipment works fine
SAM 2: Maybe they 're not blocking the signal from inside the base .
SAM 1: From where then ?
SAM 2: How long until you 're out of the ase 's range ?
SAM 1: If I maintain this speeda minute . Ninety seconds tops .
SAM 2: You ever been this far out ?
SAM 1: No , never .
SAM 2: Nothing . You ?
SAM 1: There is n't shit out hereI feel like I 'm about to drive off the end of the world . It would help if I knew what I was looking for .
SAM 2: What is it ?
SAM 1: Do n't know yet . Sam 1 getting closer .
SAM 2: Antenna ? Really ? Hang on , looks like there 's one on this side too .
SAM 1: Whoever built these things meant usiness . They were n't fucking around .
SAM 2: Its not an antennae , dude . Its a jammer . No wonder we ca n't get a live feed . These things must be locking our signal .
SAM 1: Yeah , I hear you . I 'm going to head back to base . I 'm not feeling too good .
SAM 2: I 'll stay out here a little longer . I want to see if there are any more of these things .
SAM 1: Fuck !
SAM 1: January 12th , Lunar hour 8 32 . All Harvesters running smoothly today . Readouts are as follows Matthew , 12.7 miles ; Mark 11.9 miles
SAM: John , 15.1 milessorry , I 'm not feeling too hot today I 'm going to have to continue this later
SAM 4: I 've got blood coming out of my nose
SAM 5: I do n't feel too well , Old Man .
SAM 6: My hair 's falling outlook it .
TECHNICIAN: relax and breathe deeply . The cryo pod is designed to put you into a deep sleep for the duration of your three day return journey back to Earth . As you egin to get sleepy , think about the magnificent job you 've done , and how proud your family are of what you 've accomplished .
SAM 2: I saw three more of those jammers . The base is surrounded . I printed out their coordinates
SAM 1: I found your secret room .
SAM 2: Who goes first ?
SAM 1: The cryo pod in the Return Vehicle is an incinerator . Sam 2 reacts with appropriate shock .
SAM 2: What ?
SAM 1: We do n't go home . We 're burned to death up there . Then the company wakes up a new one . Every three years . Like clock work . Sam 2 absorbing this . Then
SAM 2: How do you know all this ?
SAM 1: I hacked into the Old Man . Actually , Gerty did . I saw footage . You 're right , there have een other clones before us .
SAM 2: How many ?
SAM 1: Enough . A pause .
SAM 2: If that Rescue Unit finds the two of us awake at the same time , they 'll kill us both for sure . Sam 1 does n't respond , he 's in his own world .
GERTY: Sam , can I help you with something ?
SAM 1: Not now , Gerty , okay ?
GERTY: Helping you is what I do . Gerty leaves .
SAM 2: What 's going on ?
SAM 1: There 's something I 've got to do .
SAM 1: Come oncome on
GIRL: Hello ?
SAM 1: Uh , Bell residence ?
GIRL: This is the Bell Residence .
SAM 1: I 'm trying to reach Tess Bell .
GIRL: I 'm sorry , she passed away some years ago .
SAM 1: Nono way . The girl just stares .
GIRL: Uh , yeah , I think so . I 'm he daughter . Can I help you ?
SAM 1: Eve ?
EVE BELL: Yes ?
SAM 1: Hi Hi . Eve . How old are you now ?
EVE BELL: I 'm fifteen . Do I know you ?
SAM 1: How did mom die , sweetheart ?
EVE BELL: Uh
SAM'S VOICE: Who 's asking about mom ? Sam 1 hurriedly shuts off the VP .
SAM 1: Want me to help ?
SAM 2: Barbara Streisand ?
SAM 1: He looked like Barbara Streisand . We used to hide his Bible when he passed out . Drove the guy nuts . Sam 2 nods , remembering . A pause .
SAM 2: How do you carve these things ?
SAM 1: Want me to show you ?
SAM 2: You 're shaking .
SAM 1: Watch what I 'm doing . You watching ?
SAM 2: Yeah .
SAM 1: Now you try .
SAM 2: I suck .
SAM 1: You 'll get the hang of it . You see , that 's a little bette already .
SAM 2: What 's happening to you ? Sam 1 averts his gaze .
SAM 1: I think I 'm dying . Sam 2 stares back at him .
SAM 2: What do you think it is ?
SAM 1: Maybe we do n't live that long . Maybe we start to decompose o something .
SAM 2: Jesus .
SAM 1: No tranqs . I do n't think I would ever wake up again . Sam 1 manages a nod .
EVE: This is the Bell residence .
SAM 2: No you did n't
EVE: I 'm sorry , she passed away some years ago .
SAM 2: Gerty , I need to talk to you .
GERTY: Of course , Sam , how can I help ?
SAM 2: We found the hidden room . We know about the other clones . A long pause . Then
GERTY: I do n't know of a hidden room .
SAM 2: The hidden room under the Return Vehicle , Gerty . You know what I 'm talking about . We found it on ou own . Lunar does n't know anything about it . A beat .
GERTY: The lower deck is out of bounds to awakened clones
SAM 2: Ordinarily , Gerty , but what with there being two of us awake at the same time , and what with the situation being unprecedented , the rules have had to change . Do you understand ?
GERTY: I understand the situation is unprecedented .
SAM 2: Good . Gerty , how long does it take fo a clone to wake up ?
GERTY: A clone is awake the moment his pod is opened . But he is not fully conscious for several hours . A beat .
SAM 2: Gerty , we need to wake up a new clone .
GERTY: I am not permitted to do that , Sam .
SAM 2: If we do n't wake up another clone me and the other Sam will die . We 'll die , Gerty . Do you understand ?
GERTY: Yes .
SAM 2: Do you want me and the other Sam to die ?
GERTY: That is the last thing I want .
SAM 2: Then you have to wake up a new clone . Okay , pal ? Sam 2 waits for a response . And waits .
SAM 1: Why ? Sam 2 puts his finger to his lips . Then
SAM 2: Come to the Rec Room .
SAM 1: That guy ? Sam 2 nods .
SAM 2: I know .
SAM 1: You 're going to kill him ?
SAM 2: Someone 's got to pull the short straw here , better someone who 's unconscious than you or me .
SAM 1: What about us ? Eliza arrives , finds you and me as the welcome party
SAM 2: They 're not going to find you and me as the welcome party , they 're going to find me . You 're going to last back to Earth before they get here in one of the Helium 3 containers . You 're going home . Sam 1 was n't expecting that .
SAM 1: How do you think she died ?
SAM 2: I do n't know . Jane died of cancer . I mean , it was in the family . Who knows ? O maybe it was an accident ? Could have been a million things .
SAM 1: I wish I 'd been there .
SAM 2: Yeah . Me too .
SAM 1: No . Sam 2 chuckles .
SAM 2: But you fit . That 's good . You fit .
TESS: Come on ! Suddenly we hear a voice .
SAM 2: We need to do it . We need to do it now . He 'll be conscious any minute . We 've been putting it off fo long enough . Sam 1 stares back at Sam 2 with defiance .
SAM 1: We do n't have to do anything . I changed my mind . Sam 2 is n't following .
SAM 2: What are you talking about ? She 's your daughter , man ! She 's not going to care what you
SAM 1: She 's not ! She 's not my daughter . At least , I 'm not he father . Not to her . Sam 2 keeps quiet .
SAM 2: This is wrong . What are we supposed to do ? Sit around here and wait to die ? Fuck that !
SAM 1: I do n't know . It 's what we were designed to do .
SAM 2: Screw that ! I 'll go ! And I 'm going to find this asshole , Sam Bell , and ask him why the hell he put us through this shit !
SAM 1: You 're a good guy , Sam .
SAM 2: I might stop shaving ; It suits us . If all our memories are implants , no disrespect , but I think its about time I got some of my own , as well .
SAM 1: Yeah . You should travel . I 've always wanted to do that .
SAM 2: I 'd like that .
SAM 1: Tess came in for the interview , emember ?
SAM 2: She was going back to San Francisco .
SAM 2: How long before he 's conscious , Gerty ?
GERTY: The new clone will be conscious within one hour .
SAM 2: That 's good . That 's very good .
GERTY: Sam ? Where is Sam ?
SAM 2: He 's gone home , Gerty . Sam 2 leaves .
GERTY: Sam , this is not going to work .
SAM 2: What ? Why not ?
GERTY: If the Rescue Unit examine my memory banks they will discove what has taken place over the last week . As you know I record everything . If they are suspicious , the first thing they will do is search my memory anks , and this would put you in considerable danger .
SAM 2: So that 's what we 're going to have to do . Are you ok with that ?
GERTY: I 'll require your assistance , Sam .
SAM 2: Sure , just let me finish this . Sam 2 continues his work .
TESS: Come on , Sam ! Sam Bell ! Come on ! Sam begins to walk towards Tess .
SAM 2: I 've set your computer to reboot the second I 've blasted off .
GERTY: Okay , Sam .
SAM 2: Thanks for all your help , Gerty . I wish I could say I was going to miss you , buddy , but to be honest , I ca n't wait to get away from here .
GERTY: I understand , Sam . I hope life is everything you remember it to e .
SAM 2: Thanks . Are you sure you 're going to be ok ?
GERTY: Of course . The new Sam and I will be back to our programming as soon as I have finished ebooting .
SAM 2: Gerty , I 'm not programmed .
SAM 3: Where am I ?
GERTY: Sam , you 're in the Infirmary . You had an accident .
SAM 3: No , Gerty . I do n't remember a thing .
TESS: What took you so long ?
NARRATOR: This is the island of New Penzance . Sixteen miles long . Forested with old- growth pine and maple . Criss-crossed by shallow tidal creeks . An important seabird habitat . There are no paved roads ut instead many miles of intersecting foot paths and dirt trails and a ferry that runs twice daily from Stone Cove . The year is 1965 . We are on the far edge of Black Beacon Sound , famous for the ferocious and well-documented storm which will strike from the east on the fifth of September in three day 's time .
GADGE: Morning , sir .
ROOSEVELT: I do n't know . I think I skipped a stitch .
SKOTAK: We 're building a tree house .
PAUSE: Lower !
PANAGLE: Sixteen and a half .
TO GADGE: That enough for the Jubilee ?
REDFORD: Safety-test , sir .
BRISTLING: Come again ?
REDFORD: The vehicle appears to be in good working order . I 'm just checking if
ANGRILY: Reckless cycling . Second warning . Next time , I take away the keys .
CAPTAIN SHARP: Watch my line , Edgar .
MORE: 9 .
CAPTAIN SHARP: Any idea why ? Over .
BECKY: Hello , Diane .
MR. BILLINGSLEY: Hello ?
CAPTAIN SHARP: Hello , sir . This is Captain Sharp .
MR. BILLINGSLEY: Yes , sir . I received your message . Thank you very much . In fact , we 've come to a decision , as a family , because this is only the most recent incident involving Sam 's troubles , and it 's just not fair to the others , so , unfortunately we ca n't invite him back , at this time .
CAPTAIN SHARP: There 's no cause for alarm , sir . We 'll find him . We 're just notifying you as a matter of protocol and so on .
MR. BILLINGSLEY: I understand that . I 'm notifying you of the situation on my end .
CAPTAIN SHARP: I 'm confused by that statement . You ca n't invite him back ?
MR. BILLINGSLEY: I 'm afraid not . He 's a good boy , he 's got a good heart , but it 's just not fair to the others , you see ? He 's emotionally disturbed .
CAPTAIN SHARP: Am I speaking to Sam 's father ? Mr. Billingsley frowns . He says , surprised
MR. BILLINGSLEY: No , sir . Sam 's parents passed away a number of years ago . We 're Mr. and Mrs. Billingsley . We 're foster parents . Sam 's een with us since last June .
CAPTAIN SHARP: Mr. Billingsley , I 've got an escaped Khaki Scout . We 're notifying you as a matter of protocol . You say you ca n't invite him back ? You say he 's an orphan ? Well , I do n't understand how that works .
TOTALLY CONFUSED: What am I supposed to do with him ?
MR. BILLINGSLEY: That 's up to Social Services . They 'll be in touch with you . They 'll look afte Sam . Good luck to you .
STIFFENING: Eighth . Why ? Lazy-Eye shrugs . Scout Master Ward frowns .
REDFORD: What if he resists ?
HESITATES: Who ?
REDFORD: Shakusky . Are we allowed to use force on him ?
IRRITATED: No , you 're not . This is a non-violent escue effort . Your instructions are to find him , not to hurt him . Under any circumstances . Do I make myself understood ?
SKOTAK: Right here .
GADGE: I heard he never had any family in the first place .
DELUCA: That 's probably why he 's crazy .
REDFORD: I 'll tell you one thing if we find him , I 'm not going to be the one who forgot to ing a weapon .
NICKLEBY: Me , neither .
MR. BISHOP: Camp Ivanhoe ? That 's all the way across the other side of the island . You really think a twelve-year-old boy could row this far in a canoe ?
CAPTAIN SHARP: Most likely not .
MRS. BISHOP: It 's possible , Counsellor .
SLIGHTLY IRRITATED: I disagree , Counsellor . It 'd take him three days , at least .
MRS. BISHOP: I do n't think so . Two days , maximum .
MR. BISHOP: Well , I 'm not going to argue about it .
CAPTAIN SHARP: Be that as it may , will you let me know if you see anything unusual ?
BENJAMIN BRITTEN'S: `` NOYE 'S FLUDDE '' Performed by the Choristers of St. Jack Wood and New Penzance
SAM: What kind of bird are you ?
BOSSY GIRL: I 'm a sparrow , she 's a dove , and
SAM: No , I said , `` What kind of bird are you ? '' The other girls all look to Suzy . Pause .
SUZY: I 'm a raven .
BOSSY GIRL: Boy 's are n't allowed in here .
SAM: I 'll be leaving soon .
SUZY: I got hit in the mirror .
SAM: Really . How 'd that happen ?
SUZY: I lost my temper at myself .
SAM: Sam . What 's yours ?
SUZY: I 'm Suzy .
BOSSY GIRL: It 's not polite to stare .
MRS. LYNN: Birds ! Ready ?
SKINNY GIRL: He likes you .
SAM: Were you followed ?
SUZY: I doubt it .
SAM: Good . Sam frowns and squints . He points .
SUZY: Uh-huh .
SAM: I do cartography .
SUZY: OK .
SAM: Here 's where we are right now . I 'd like to pitch camp here by sixteen-hundred . How does that sound ?
SUZY: Fine .
SAM: You want some beef jerky ?
SUZY: OK .
SAM: Let 's go .
SUZY: No .
SAM: Well , if your throat gets parched , stick a pebble in your mouth and suck on it . You can quench your thirst with the spit , supposedly .
SUZY: That 's a good idea . It might help also if you did n't wear fur .
SAM: True , but this adds camouflage .
SUZY: Which way ?
SAM: Unknown . I guess it does n't really matter , as long as we cover our tracks .
SUZY: No , they 're huckleberries , in fact . Try one .
SAM: Not bad . Anyway , they 're good fo survival .
SUZY: He knows someone 's watching him .
SAM: I agree . Why do you say that ?
SUZY: I do n't know . I just think he can feel us .
SAM: You smell like perfume .
SUZY: It 's my mother 's .
SAM: I brought water , too .
SUZY: What for ?
SAM: Trout bait . We need worms .
SUZY: No .
SAM: You 're right . We 'll let him live . Maybe I 've got a licorice whip .
SUZY: Pretty good . I broke our school record for the back-stroke .
MILDLY SURPRISED: OK. Well , I 'm not that strong of a swimmer , so I wear a life-preserver . I think it 's a good policy to get in the habit , anyway .
SUZY: OK .
SAM: Watch out for turtles . They 'll bite you , if you put your fingers in their mouths . Let me see if I can catch this one .
SUZY: The stick 's moving !
SAM: You got one !
TO SUZY: Reel him in ! Slowly . The canoe rocks violently . Suzy snaps
SUZY: Sit down !
SAM: You 're doing good .
SUZY: Very good . You know a lot about camping , do n't you ?
SAM: I 'm a Khaki Scout . It 's what I 'm trained for .
SUZY: That 's OK . He only eats cat food .
SAM: What else did you bring ? We should make an inventory .
SUZY: OK .
SAM: Go ahead .
SUZY: This is my record player . It works with atteries . Actually , it belongs to my little brother Lionel . I left him a note . Do you like music ?
SAM: That 's it ? No mess-kit ? No flashlight ? No canteen ? No waterproof matches ? Did n't you get the packing list I sent you in my last letter ?
SUZY: I thought that 's what you 're supposed to ing . I do n't own a canteen . Pause . Sam shrugs . He smiles .
SAM: That 's OK. We can share .
SUZY: I might turn some of them back in one day . I have n't decided yet . I know it 's ad . I think I just took them to have a secret to keep . Anyway , for some reason , it makes me feel in a better mood sometimes .
SAM: Are you depressed ? Suzy bites her fingernails . She shrugs .
SUZY: Well , I can show you an example , if you want but it does n't make me feel very good . I found this on top of ou efrigerator .
SAM: Does that mean you ? Suzy nods . Sam explodes with laughter .
SUZY: It 's not funny .
SAM: To me , it is .
SUZY: You really know how to make friends .
SAM: I 'm sorry .
SUZY: That 's OK .
SAM: I 'm on your side .
SUZY: I know .
SAM: Which one 's the best ?
SUZY: His eyes downcast , his kingdom in ruins , Mynar pressed his heavy paw through the ippling surface of the cool shallows and down to its stone floor . `` My people once were lead by a great and noble beast and I no longer see his face in this eflection . ''
MRS. BISHOP: Where 's your sister ?
LIONEL: I do n't know , but she borrowed my record player for ten days without asking .
MRS. BISHOP: What does that mean ?
MR. BISHOP: That 's a loaded question .
MRS. BISHOP: Come down and read this .
MR. BISHOP: Who 's there ?
CAPTAIN SHARP: Good evening . Sorry to startle you . I was
MR. BISHOP: What are you doing here ? Nobody called the police .
CAPTAIN SHARP: I know , that 's what I 'm saying . The search party 's not over yet . In othe
MRS. BISHOP: Suzy 's missing , too ! Go find her .
CAPTAIN SHARP: OK. Where 'd she
MR. BISHOP: Wait for me .
CAPTAIN SHARP: I do n't know , but just for the record ninety-five percent of all runaways eturn home within six hours . That does n't do you any good right now . It 's just a statistic but in all likelihood Suzy 's probably hiding in the closet at her best friend 's house playing Chinese Checkers at this very moment , as we speak .
MR. BISHOP: She does n't have any friends .
CAPTAIN SHARP: How 's Laura ?
MR. BISHOP: How 's Laura ?
CAPTAIN SHARP: Mrs. Bishop , I mean .
MR. BISHOP: I do n't understand .
CAPTAIN SHARP: Is she upset ?
MRS. BISHOP: She has a pen pal ! It 's very intimate ! They planned this together !
CAPTAIN SHARP: Sam Shakusky . That 's my escaped Khaki Scout . His family died .
MR. BISHOP: Holy Christ . What am I looking at ?
MRS. BISHOP: He does watercolors ! Mostly landscapes , ut a few nudes !
MR. BISHOP: She sit for this ?
CAPTAIN SHARP: What does he say ?
BECKY: I 'm not sure . I think he went searching in the dark .
MR. BISHOP: She stole the batteries out of my flashlight .
CAPTAIN SHARP: I think he 's onto us .
MRS. BISHOP: Of course , he is .
CAPTAIN SHARP: Of course , he is ?
MRS. BISHOP: Of course , he is .
CAPTAIN SHARP: Why are n't we worried about that , then ?
MRS. BISHOP: I am .
CAPTAIN SHARP: Well , I did n't know . Or , anyway , I thought I was wrong . Did you hit him ?
MRS. BISHOP: No . He fell in a ditch .
NICKLEBY: Cat food ! I think it 's a clue .
MR. BISHOP: That 's her .
MRS. BISHOP: I do n't know .
CAPTAIN SHARP: All right . We know they 're together . We know they 're within a certain radius of this spot . I 'm declaring the case with the county right now . Until help arrives
SUZY: They found the canoe .
SAM: Rats ! I should 've put more pine needles on it . Let 's go . We 're almost there .
REDFORD: We 're looking for you .
SAM: Why ?
REDFORD: Because you 're a fugitive .
SAM: No , I 'm not . Did n't you get my letter of esignation ? I quit the Khaki Scouts .
REDFORD: You 're still in uniform .
SAM: Listen to some reason I do n't like you . You do n't like me . Why do n't you stupid idiots just let us disappear ?
REDFORD: It 's tempting , but I ca n't allow it . Deluca spits on the ground . He says to Suzy
DELUCA: You should n't be friends with him .
SUZY: Why not ?
DELUCA: Because he 's crazy .
SUZY: Maybe you just do n't know him .
REDFORD: We know him a lot better than you . He 's emotionally disturbed because his family died . Nickleby , tie him up .
SAM: Do not cross this stick .
REDFORD: You 're doomed , Shakusky .
SAM: It was him or us .
SUZY: Oh , no .
SAM: They got Snoopy through the neck .
SUZY: He needs a doctor .
SAM: No , he does n't . He needs a morgue .
SUZY: He 's losing blood . Hurry . Where do we go ?
SAM: Suzy . Look at me . Snoopy 's not going to make it .
SUZY: Do n't say that .
SAM: They 're after us . We got to move .
SUZY: He 's dying ! We ca n't just leave him !
SAM: It 's too late ! He 's already gone !
SUZY: Stop yelling at me !
SAM: I 'm sorry I had to do that , but you 're panicking . The first rule in any emergency is you never
SUZY: Do n't ever do that again . No one 's allowed to slap me .
SAM: Who 's to say but he did n't deserve to die .
CAPTAIN SHARP: Puncture wound . Lower lumbar . Make room for a stretcher in the cockpit !
NICKLEBY: I tried to chop him , but he dodged my tomahawk .
PANAGLE: Who else got hit ?
IZOD: Not me . I ran away when the girl went erserk .
SKOTAK: He 's got great marksmanship . He shot Deluca in both arms .
GADGE: Where 's Snoopy ?
MR. BISHOP: What happened ? Who 's that ? Why 's he leeding ?
CAPTAIN SHARP: Clear the dock , Edgar !
MRS. BISHOP: Is Suzy with you ?
GADGE: No , she 's in the woods with Shakusky .
JED: Where 'm I going ?
CAPTAIN SHARP: The infirmary at Fort Lebanon . We 'll be ight behind you .
MR. BISHOP: Hold it right there . You 're not leaving this island . Our daughter 's been abducted y one these beige lunatics .
CAPTAIN SHARP: Walt , it 's very clear the two of them conspired in this together .
MR. BISHOP: Why ca n't you control your scouts ?
CAPTAIN SHARP: Stop .
MRS. BISHOP: Stop it , Walt !
CAPTAIN SHARP: I do blame him but I also blame myself and both of you . With all due respect you ca n't let your children stab people .
MRS. BISHOP: What are you talking about ?
CAPTAIN SHARP: Easy does it . Calm down , Laura .
MR. BISHOP: Stay away from my wife .
NARRATOR: As some of you know , I taught Sam for the cartography Accomplishment Patch . He 's a smart boy , and he expressed a keen interest in the history of the island 's indigenous peoples . In particular , I ecall his fascination with the idea of etracing the original path of the old Chickchaw harvest migration .
SUZY: This is weird .
SAM: I know !
SUZY: I like it here , but I do n't like the name .
SAM: Me , neither .
SUZY: Mile 3.25 Tidal Inlet . It 's got no ring to it .
SAM: Let 's change it . What should it be ?
SUZY: Let me think for a minute . Sam continues to paint while Suzy thinks .
SAM: I made you some jewelry .
SUZY: It 's pretty . Do the other one .
SAM: Do you mind ?
SUZY: I like it .
SAM: Tilt your head sideways .
SUZY: You can touch my chest .
SAM: Why do you always use binoculars ? Suzy thinks for minute . She says finally
SUZY: It helps me see things closer . Even if they 're not very far away . I pretend it 's my magic power .
SAM: That sounds like poetry . Poems do n't always have to rhyme , you know . They 're just supposed to be creative .
SUZY: I do n't know . I want to go on adventures , I think . Not get stuck in one place . How about you ?
SAM: Go on adventures , too . Not get stuck , too . I guess that sounds almost like I 'm just repeating what you just said , but I could n't think of anything as good as it . On the other hand , maybe we 'll get blown up by an atom bomb . You ca n't predict the exact future .
SUZY: That 's true .
SAM: It 's possible I may wet the bed , by the way . Later , I mean .
SUZY: OK .
SAM: I wish I did n't have to mention it , but just in case . I do n't want to make you be offended .
SUZY: Of course , I wo n't .
SAM: Some people frown on these problems .
SUZY: What 's that one for ? Sam looks at the brooch . He shakes his head .
SAM: It 's not an accomplishment . I inherited it from my mother . It 's actually not meant for a male to wear but I do n't give a damn . Suzy nods thoughtfully . Pause .
SUZY: Are your foster parents still mad at you ? For getting in trouble so much .
SAM: I do n't think so . We 're getting to know each other better . I feel like I 'm in a family now . Not like yours , but simila to one .
SUZY: I always wished I was an orphan . Most of my favorite characters are . I think you lives are more special .
SAM: I love you , but you do n't know what you 're talking about . Long pause . Suzy says genuinely
SUZY: I love you , too .
MR. BISHOP: Suzy ! Get out here !
MRS. BISHOP: Put your clothes on . Both of you .
SKOTAK: How long were you planning to stay there ?
SAM: I do n't know .
MURRAY: You said ten days or less .
SUZY: That was a lie .
GADGE: Did n't you ever think about what would happen next ?
SAM: Not to my recollection .
LIONEL: You 're a traitor to our family .
SUZY: Good . I want to be .
CAPTAIN SHARP: Give him his mail .
SUZY: What does it say ?
SAM: They ca n't invite me back .
SUZY: Why not ?
SAM: I gave them too much aggravation .
SUZY: Let me read it .
MR. BISHOP: Be advised the two of you will never see each other again . Those were your last words . Do you understand ?
SUZY: I 'd be careful if I were you . One of these days somebody 's going to be pushed too far , and who knows what they 're capable of .
MR. BISHOP: Is that a threat ?
SUZY: It 's a warning .
MR. BISHOP: I beg your pardon ?
MRS. BISHOP: Please , terminate this conversation .
MR. BISHOP: She 's saying that to me ?
BECKY: Judy , I have your person-to-person from New Penzance .
CAPTAIN SHARP: Hello ? This is Captain Sharp .
SOCIAL SERVICES: Hello , Captain Sharp . This is Social Services . I 'm calling in reference to Sam Shakusky , Ward of the State . I understand he 's in your custody .
CAPTAIN SHARP: That 's correct .
SOCIAL SERVICES: What 's his condition ? Has he suffered any injury or trauma of any kind ?
CAPTAIN SHARP: He 's OK .
SOCIAL SERVICES: Very good . How do I get to you ?
CAPTAIN SHARP: The fastest way is by seaplane . Jed can ing you in with the mail .
SOCIAL SERVICES: I 'll come tomorrow morning , if that 's acceptable to you . Is someone able to
MORE: 60 .
CAPTAIN SHARP: Uh-huh .
SOCIAL SERVICES: Is that a yes ?
CAPTAIN SHARP: Uh-huh .
SOCIAL SERVICES: Very good . I 'll contact you again before the end of the day .
CAPTAIN SHARP: Wait a second .
SOCIAL SERVICES: Yes ?
CAPTAIN SHARP: Social Services ?
SOCIAL SERVICES: Captain Sharp .
CAPTAIN SHARP: What 's going to happen to him ?
SOCIAL SERVICES: Well , normally , we 'd try to place him in another foster home , but that option is no longer available to us , in my opinion , with his case history which means he 'll go to Juvenile Refuge .
CAPTAIN SHARP: Excuse me . Shock therapy ? Why would that e necessary ? He 's not violent .
SOCIAL SERVICES: The report describes an assault with scissors .
CAPTAIN SHARP: That was the girl ! Who did that .
SOCIAL SERVICES: Well , maybe she needs help , too but that 's not our job . OK ?
CAPTAIN SHARP: OK .
MR. BISHOP: I 'll be out back .
MRS. BISHOP: I do know what you 're feeling , Suzy-bean . I 've had moments myself where I say what am I doing here ? Who made this decision ? How could I allow myself to do something so stupid
WITH FEELING: and why is it still happening ? We women are more emotional . You have to
SUZY: I hate you .
MRS. BISHOP: Do n't say `` hate '' .
SUZY: Why not ? I mean it .
MRS. BISHOP: You think you mean it . In this moment . You 're trying to hurt me .
SUZY: Exactly .
PAUSE: I know what you do with that sad , dum police man . You go to bed with him . Mrs. Bishop looks stunned . She says quietly
MRS. BISHOP: He 's not dumb , but I guess he is kind of sad . Anyway , we should n't discuss that . It 's not appropriate for me to even acknowledge what I already just said .
SUZY: We 're in love . We just want to be together . What 's wrong with that ?
MRS. BISHOP: Oh , my God . How are we going to get these fish-hooks out ?
SAM: I admit we knew we 'd get in trouble . That part 's true . We knew people would be worried , and we still ran away , anyway ut something also happened which we did n't do on purpose . When we first met each other . Something happened to us .
CAPTAIN SHARP: I agree with you . That 's eloquent . I ca n't argue against anything you 're saying but I do n't have to , because you 're twelve years old .
SAM: Maybe so . Anyway , you 're a bachelor .
CAPTAIN SHARP: What does that have to do with it ? So are you .
SAM: That 's true . Did you love someone ever ?
CAPTAIN SHARP: Yes , I did .
SAM: What happened ?
CAPTAIN SHARP: She did n't love me back .
SAM: Ah .
CAPTAIN SHARP: I 'm sorry for your loss . Anyway , that 's what people say .
SAM: Thanks .
CAPTAIN SHARP: What happened ?
SAM: A drunk truck driver smashed into them .
CAPTAIN SHARP: Good grief .
GADGE: I heard he 's going to reform school .
DELUCA: I heard they 're going to take out a piece of his brain and send him to an insane asylum .
ROOSEVELT: I like his girl .
PANAGLE: She 's too scruffy for me .
NICKLEBY: Supposedly , they got to third base .
SKOTAK: Damn us .
MORE: 67 .
SKOTAK: Nickleby ? Deluca ? Lazy-Eye ? Gadge ?
DELUCA: What do you need ?
SKOTAK: For starters ? Three yards of chicken wire , some ripped-up newspapers , and a ucket of wheatpaste .
CAPTAIN SHARP: In other words , it 's over .
MRS. BISHOP: I guess so . For the moment .
CAPTAIN SHARP: Until further notice .
MRS. BISHOP: That 's right .
CAPTAIN SHARP: I understand .
MRS. BISHOP: I 've got to do better . For everybody .
CAPTAIN SHARP: Except me .
MRS. BISHOP: Except you .
CAPTAIN SHARP: Well , I hope you can . I think you will . You 're doing the right thing .
MRS. BISHOP: Who know what 's going to happen , Duffy ? I 'll probably see you tomorrow .
CAPTAIN SHARP: No , you wo n't .
MRS. BISHOP: I do n't see it that way .
SAM: Get out of my chimney .
SKOTAK: Listen to me . We 're here for friendship . We 're going to get you off this island .
SAM: No , thanks .
SKOTAK: Yes , thanks . This is an emergency rescue .
SAM: It 's worthless to me . There 's no point . Not without Suzy .
SUZY: They snuck me down the laundry chute and left a paper-maché dummy in my bed .
SAM: Diversion tactics . Good thinking .
SUZY: Not this time . He ca n't keep his trap shut . Besides , I 'll probably never see him again .
SAM: That 's true .
NARRATOR: This is the island of St. Jack Wood , extending far north from Land 's End along the deep-water channel that leads to Broken Rock . A low flood-plain separates the beach from the town-ship above . A small but prosperous community .
MRS. BISHOP: Did you file the motion for continuance ? Peabody vs. Henderson .
MR. BISHOP: It was sustained .
MRS. BISHOP: Good .
MR. BISHOP: Did the judge consider your application for leniency ? Rogers vs. Yentob .
MRS. BISHOP: He granted it .
MR. BISHOP: Great .
MRS. BISHOP: I 'm sorry , Walt .
MR. BISHOP: It 's not your fault . Which injuries are you apologizing for ? Specifically .
MRS. BISHOP: Specifically ? Whichever ones still hurt .
MR. BISHOP: Half of those were self-inflicted .
MRS. BISHOP: Stop feeling sorry for yourself .
MR. BISHOP: Why ?
MRS. BISHOP: We 're all they 've got , Walt .
MR. BISHOP: It 's not enough .
SUZY: `` but I 'm not going , '' said Barnaby Jack . `` I 'm running away tonight for good , and this time I wo n't get caught . '' Annabelle whispered `` I 'm coming with you . '' Her yellow hair , now brown at the oots , caught up in the wind and danced . Barnaby Jack took Annabelle 's hand and pressed something into it the size of a jellybean . `` Hide this in your socks , and e ready at midnight . ''
COMMANDER PIERCE: Well , I 'll be damned . Who is this bimbo ?
VAGUELY: I could n't say .
GUARD SCOUT: Who 's your unit leader ?
NICKLEBY: That guy .
SKOTAK: There 's a broken gum-ball machine behind the snack tent .
COUSIN BEN: I do n't care how they do it where you come from . You want pop ? You want candy ? You want a snake-bite kit ? Get some money .
SAM: Field Mate Sam Shakusky , Troop 55 , esigned .
COUSIN BEN: He 's hot . Almost too hot . What 's in the can ?
SKOTAK: Seventy-six dollars but it 's mostly in nickels .
COUSIN BEN: Give it to me .
SAM: Yes , sir .
COUSIN BEN: Good . There 's cold-water crabber moored off Broken Rock . The skipper owes me an I.O.U . We 'll see if he can take you on as a claw cracker . It wo n't be an easy life , ut it 's better than shock therapy .
SAM: Thank you , sir . By the way , where 's the chapel tent ?
COUSIN BEN: Back there , but the padre 's home with the mumps . Why do you ask ?
SAM: I want to bring my wife .
SUZY: But we 're not married yet .
COUSIN BEN: You his girl ?
SUZY: We 're in a hurry .
COUSIN BEN: Spit out the gum , sister . In fact , everybody .
SAM: I guess we better try to pretend we 're struggling over our decision for a minute efore we go back over there and tell him
SUZY: Maybe he 's right . It could be a mistake .
SAM: What ? Why ? How ?
SUZY: Being married . Sometimes it seems sad to me . It might be better to just go steady permanently .
SAM: I do n't know what to say .
COUSIN BEN: I guess they 're probably just trying to pretend they 're struggling over thei decision , but at least
SKOTAK: Woah !
SUZY: We 're sure .
COUSIN BEN: OK. Let 's do a blood test .
LOOKING UP: That 's the end of the short-form . Do any of the witnesses have objections o emarks ? Usually , they do n't .
COUSIN BEN: Skotak .
SKOTAK: Can we loan them the nickels ? I 'm worried about their future .
COUSIN BEN: That 's my fee .
NICKLEBY: What 's going to happen to them ?
GADGE: Nobody knows .
DELUCA: Let 's take a vote .
SKOTAK: All in favor
COUSIN BEN: That 's my fee .
NICKLEBY: Where they going again ?
GADGE: He 's going to work on a shrimper , if I understand correctly .
SKOTAK: I wish them well .
ROOSEVELT: I think they 're coming back .
COUSIN BEN: Be quick , sailor !
SKOTAK: What happened ?
SAM: She left her binoculars on a hook in the chapel tent .
DELUCA: Just leave them .
SAM: We ca n't . It 's her magic power !
REDFORD: Snoopy ?
SHRUGS: Well , it could n't be helped . Sam nods . He asks quietly
SAM: Why do you consider me your enemy ? Redford frowns . He says in disbelief
REDFORD: Because your girlfriend stabbed me in the ack with lefty scissors .
SAM: She 's my wife now .
REDFORD: Congratulations .
SAM: I 'm saying before that . Six weeks ago . From day one . What 'd I do wrong ? I 'm trying to understand .
IN SUMMATION: Why do n't you like me ?
REDFORD: Why should I ? Nobody else does .
SAM: I 'm OK .

WARMLY: Of course , I am . Come on .
SOCIAL SERVICES: Where 's the boy ? Captain Sharp hesitates . He says reluctantly
CAPTAIN SHARP: We do n't know yet .
SOCIAL SERVICES: That 's not acceptable .
CAPTAIN SHARP: What do you want me to say , lady ? Somebody get Jed a cup of coffee .
SOCIAL SERVICES: You 're Captain Sharp ?
CAPTAIN SHARP: That 's right .
SOCIAL SERVICES: I 'm Social Services . I remanded the boy to your personal custody . You 're esponsible for his safety . I 'm told he was just struck by lightning .
CAPTAIN SHARP: That 's the first I heard of it .
UNFORTUNATELY: It 's true .
SOCIAL SERVICES: Scout Master Ward , I presume ?
ENCOUNTER: in a twenty-seven year career !
SOCIAL SERVICES: What do you have to say for yourselves ? Captain Sharp hesitates . He says strangely
CAPTAIN SHARP: You ca n't do this . They 'll eat him alive in there .
SOCIAL SERVICES: Where ?
CAPTAIN SHARP: What 's the name of the place again ?
HESITATES: Juvenile refuge ?
CAPTAIN SHARP: Juvenile refuge . That sounds like jail .
SOCIAL SERVICES: Just find the boy and deliver him to Social Services . Nothing else is in your power .
MR. BISHOP: I 'm sorry .
MRS. BISHOP: Suzy 's still out there .
SOCIAL SERVICES: Who are you ?
MRS. BISHOP: I object to that description . She was attacked .
COMMANDER PIERCE: I want the details . Where 's the scout she knifed ?
REDFORD: Field Mate Redford , sir .
COMMANDER PIERCE: What 's his condition ?
MRS. BISHOP: We do n't have time for this !

SAM: OK. 99 .
CAPTAIN SHARP: Counsellors ? What 's the legal perspective ? Over !

RONNY: Yes .
LORETTA: You really are stupid , you know that . Loretta pours herself another shot .
RONNY: You do n't know nothing about it .
LORETTA: I was raised that a girl gets married young . I did n't get married until I was twenty-eight . I met a man . I loved him . I married him . He wanted to have a baby right away . I said no . Then he got hit by a bus . No man . No baby . No nothing ! I did not know that man was a gift I could not keep .

I can see everything . You are a wolf !
RONNY: I 'm a wolf ?
LORETTA: The big part of you has no words and it's-a wolf . This woman was a trap for you . She caught you and you could not get away . So you chewed off your foot ! That was the price you had to pay to be free . Johnny had nothing to do with it . You did what you had to do , between you and you , and I know I 'm right , I do n't care what you say . And now you 're afraid because you found out the big part of you is a wolf that has the courage to bite off its own hand to save itself from the trap of the wrong love . That 's why there has een no woman since that wrong woman . You are scared to death what the wolf will do if you make that mistake again !
RONNY: What are you doing !
LORETTA: I 'm telling you your life !
RONNY: Stop it !
LORETTA: No !
RONNY: Why are you marrying Johnny ? He 's a fool !
LORETTA: Because I have no Luck !
RONNY: He made me look the wrong way and I cut off my hand . He could make you look the wrong way and you could cut off your whole head !
LORETTA: I am looking where I should to become a bride !
RONNY: A bride without a head !
LORETTA: A wolf without a foot !
RONNY: It 's like I 'm falling ! It 's like I 'm in the ocean !
LORETTA: I have no Luck ! He picks her up in his arms .
RONNY: Son of a bitch !
LORETTA: Where are you taking me ?
RONNY: To the bed .
LORETTA: Oh . Oh God . I do n't care about anything . I do n't care about anything ! Take me to the bed . He carries her away , into the bedroom .
RONNY: I ca n't believe what is happening .
LORETTA: Me neither .
RONNY: I was dead .
LORETTA: I was dead , too .
RONNY: Your blood .
LORETTA: All my life I have never reached a man . I knew that I would reach my husband , but I took my time and he was dead . Ronny .
RONNY: Loretta .

LORETTA: I 'm really afraid .
RONNY: Why ?
LORETTA: I 'm afraid of who I am .
RONNY: I was .
LORETTA: And you 're not now ? He shakes his head .
RONNY: I do n't know . Everything seems like nothing now against that I want you in my bed . I do n't care if I burn in hell . I do n't care if you burn in hell . The Past and Future is a joke to me now . I see that they 're nothing , I see they ai n't here . The only thing that 's here is you . And me . I want you to come upstairs . Now . I tried to take everything last night , like you told me , but I could n't . I could n't take everything in a hundred years . It 's the way we are . We compound each other .
LORETTA: Let me go home .
RONNY: No .
LORETTA: Let me go home .
RONNY: No .
LORETTA: I 'm freezing to death .
RONNY: Come upstairs . I do n't care why you come . No , that 's not what I mean . Loretta , I love you . Not like they told you love is and I did n't know this either . But love do n't make things nice , it ruins everything , it eaks your heart , it makes things a mess . We 're not here to make things perfect . Snowflakes are perfect . The stars are perfect . Not us . We are here to ruin ourselves and break ou hearts and love the wrong people and die ! The storybooks are bullshit . Come upstairs with me , baby ! Do n't try to live your life out to somebody else 's idea of sweet happiness . Do n't try to live on milk and cookies when what you want is meat ! Red meat just like me ! It 's wolves run with wolves and nothing else ! You 're a wolf just like me ! Come upstairs with me and get in my bed ! Come on ! Come on ! Come on ! Loretta follows Ronny into his building .
MR. JOHNNY: 19 Cranberry Street .
ROSE: Moving in ?

MR. JOHNNY: Where is she ?
ROSE: Out . I do n't know where . I was waiting up for my husband .
MR. JOHNNY: It 's late .
ROSE: Yes .
MR. JOHNNY: Maybe I should go ?
ROSE: What are you doing here ? You 're supposed to be in Palermo .
MR. JOHNNY: That 's what I came to tell Loretta . There 's been a miracle .
ROSE: A miracle . Well , that 's news .
MR. JOHNNY: My mother 's recovered .
ROSE: You 're kidding ?
MR. JOHNNY: The breath had almost totally left her body . She was as white as snow . And then she completely pulled back from death and stood up and put on her clothes and began to cook fo everyone in the house . The mourners . And me . And herself ! She ate a meal that would choke a pig !
ROSE: That 's incredible .
MR. JOHNNY: Yes .
ROSE: Hello Pop .
MR. JOHNNY: Who was that ?
ROSE: That was my father-in-law , who has a wrong idea in his head . Listen , Johnny , there 's a question I want to ask you . And I want you to tell me the truth if you can . Why do men chase women ?
MR. JOHNNY: Well . There 's the Bible story . God took a rib from Adam and made Eve . Maybe men chase women to get the ri ack . When God took the rib , he left a hole there , place where there used to be something . and the women have that . Maybe a man is n't complete as a man without a woman .
ROSE: But why would a man need more than one woman ?
MR. JOHNNY: I do n't know . Maybe because he fears death . Rose leaps up , very excited .
ROSE: That 's it ! That 's the reason !
MR. JOHNNY: I do n't know .
ROSE: No , that 's really it . Thank you fo answering my question .
COSMO: Hi . Hi .
MR. JOHNNY: Hello , Mr. Castorini .

LORETTA: Well . I do n't really know where to start .
ROSE: Your hair 's different .
LORETTA: Everything 's different .
ROSE: Are you drunk ?
LORETTA: No . Are you drunk ?

LORETTA: Where 's pop ?

LORETTA: WHAT ! ! She was dying !
ROSE: It was a miracle .
LORETTA: A miracle ? This is modern times ! There ai n't supposed to be miracles any more !
ROSE: I guess it ai n't modern times in Sicily . He came right from the airport . He wanted to talk to you . You got a love bite on your neck . He 's coming back this morning .
LORETTA: Ronny !
RONNY: Is Johnny here ?
LORETTA: He 's coming .
RONNY: Good ! We can get this out on the table . I 'm Ronny , Johnny 's brother .

LORETTA: Ronny , please

COSMO: His brother .
RONNY: Yeah .
OLD MAN: I am old . The Old are not wanted . And what they say has no weight . But , my son , I must speak . You should pay for the wedding of your only daughter . You are breaking your house through pride . There . I 've said it .
COSMO: It 's okay , Pop . If she gets married , I 'll pay for the whole thing .
ROSE: Have I been a good wife ?
COSMO: Yes .
ROSE: I want you to stop seeing her .
COSMO: Okay .
ROSE: And go to confession .
COSMO: A man under stands one day that his life is built on nothing . And that 's a bad , crazy day .
ROSE: Your life is not built on nothing . Ti amo . She puts her hand across the table to him .
COSMO: Ti amo .
LORETTA: It 's Johnny . I 'll get it . Loretta 's tone is fatal .
RONNY: I 'll get it . Rose gets up .
ROSE: I 'll get it . She goes to answer the door .
RONNY: No , I 'll tell him .
LORETTA: No , I 'll tell him . What am I going to tell him ?
COSMO: Tell him the truth , Loretta they find out anyway . Loretta looks at her father .
LORETTA: I love you Pop . It 's a private moment .
RITA: Hi Loretta .
LORETTA: Hi .
RAYMOND: Hi , Loretta .
LORETTA: Hi . Why ai n't you at the store ?
RITA: Is there anything you want to tell us , honey ?
LORETTA: You ? No .
RAYMOND: We just come from the bank .

RITA: She 's got it .
RAYMOND: I knew she had it .
RITA: We did n't know what to think . You were so weird yesterday , and then this morning , we go to the bank and no bag .
ROSE: Listen . Who wants coffee ?

Born and raised ight here , he 's as typical a New Yorker as anyone you 'll ever meet . At least he was . And if you want to know the real story , I guess I 'm your boy . Cole 's my name , Bill Cole . I 'm Jim 's lawye and quote , best friend , unquote . Jim 's one of those bright young men from Yale . Advertising business , lovely wife , two fine kids , makes almost fifteen thousand a year . Want to know why ? Just look up there .

BETSY'S VOICE: Okay , dad .
JIM: Mm .
JOAN: Okay , dad .
JIM: Mm .
GUSSIE: 'Morning , Mr. Blandings !
JIM: Mm .
MURIEL: Mm ?
JIM: Coffee .
MURIEL: Thank you , dear .
JIM: My socks .
MURIEL: Why do n't you look in your sock drawer ?
JIM: That 's where I found my underwear .
MURIEL: Oh . Well , try your underwear drawer .
JIM: I 'm in my underwear drawer .
MURIEL: Well , they must be somewhere . Socks just do n't get up and walk away by themselves .
JIM: Muriel , I thought the top two-and-a- half drawers were to be mine ! I wish you 'd tell Gussie
MURIEL: The closet ! That 's where they are . We put them in the closet .
JIM: Socks ? In the closet ?
MURIEL: Well , there did n't seem to be any oom in the drawers
JIM: And there 's so much of it in the closet !
MURIEL: so Gussie and I decided that from now on we 'll keep them in a basket on the shelf .
JIM: Well , thanks a lot !
MURIEL: Jim , I do wish you 'd make an effort to be a little less clumsy .
JIM: I 'll try , dear .
JOAN: Father , just one morning I wish you 'd knock !
JIM: 'Morning , dear .
MURIEL: Excuse
JIM: Excuse
MURIEL: Sorry .
JIM: Take your time . I can spare the blood .
MURIEL: Oh cut yourself ?
JIM: I cut myself every morning . I kind of look forward to it .
MURIEL: Why do n't you get an electric razor ?
JIM: Do n't like them . No close shave .
MURIEL: Ridiculous ! Bill Cole 's been using one for years .
JIM: He does n't have my beard !
MURIEL: That 's silly . Bill 's beard is just as tough and coarse and
JIM: I 'm not interested in discussing the grain and texture of Bill Cole 's hair follicles before I 've had my orange juice .
MURIEL: You do n't have to carry on so . I only said , why do n't you get an electric razor ?
JIM: Because I prefer the cool , clean sweep of the tempered steel as it glides smoothly
MURIEL: Stop writing advertising copy ! Hurry up , dear , you 'll be late fo eakfast .
JIM: Who did this ?
BETSY: I did .
JIM: I have repeatedly told you do n't cut up the morning pape until I 've had a chance to look at it !
BETSY: I 'm sorry , father . It 's necessary esearch .
JIM: I suppose this is another of Miss Stellwagon 's so-called Progressive Projects ?
MURIEL: Now dear , there just is n't any point in sending your children to an expensive school if you 're going to undermine the teacher 's authority in your own dining room .
JIM: I 'm not undermining anything . I happen to be in the advertising business and keeping abreast of the times is important to me .
MURIEL: And so is your children 's education .
JIM: That 's not the point .
MURIEL: It certainly is .
JIM: It certainly is not !
JOAN: Bicker , bicker , bicker .
JIM: You eat your cornflakes !
MURIEL: Joan , every time your father and I have a lively discussion we are n't necessarily bickering . What is it , dear , another English composition ?
BETSY: Miss Stellwagon has assigned each of us to take a want ad and write a human interest theme about it . I found one typical of the disintegration of our present society .
JIM: I was n't aware of the fact that ou society was disintegrating .
BETSY: I did n't expect you to be , father . Miss Stellwagon says that middle- class people like us are all too prone to overlook the pressures and tensions which befall the less fortunate members of our community . Jim puts down the paper , turns to Muriel .
JIM: Muriel , I know it 's asking a lot , ut just one morning I would like to sit down and have breakfast without social significance ! Picks up his paper .
MURIEL: Jim , you really might take a little more interest in your children 's education .
JOAN: You ca n't squeeze blood from a turnip .
JIM: All right . All right . I 'll listen .
BETSY: It 's just twenty-four words . But in simple eloquence it mirrors a mino tragedy of our times .
JIM: Well ?
BETSY: `` Forced to sell . Farm dwelling , oak grove , apple orchard , trout stream , hay fields , four barns , seclusion , superb view , original beams , paved highway , acreage Will sacrifice '' Pause .
JIM: Go on .
BETSY: That 's all .
JIM: That 's all ? !
BETSY: You do n't see it , do you , father ?
JIM: No . Fellow wants to sell a house so he puts an ad in the paper . What did you expect him to do , take it to the United Nations !
MURIEL: There must be more to it than that . Is n't there , dear ?
BETSY: Certainly , mother . What some people do n't see is the whole sordid picture . A poor , honest farmer , pushed to the wall by hardship , soil erosion , mortgages , everybody gobbling , gobbling , gobbling , until finally , in desperation , he is `` forced to sell , '' and stoops to the crass commercialism of newspape advertising .
JIM: Oh , indeed crass commercialism advertising
JOAN: Miss Stellwagon says advertising is a basically parasitic profession .
JIM: Oh , she does ?
JOAN: Miss Stellwagon says that advertising makes people who ca n't afford it buy things they do n't want with money they have n't got .
JIM: Perhaps your Miss Stellwagon is right . Perhaps I ought to get out of this `` basically parasitic profession , '' which at the moment is paying fo her very fancy tuition , those extra French lessons , her progressive summe camp and for that matter , the very aces on your teeth !
MURIEL: I wish you would n't discuss money in front of the children .
JIM: Why not , they spend enough of it !
JOAN: Bicker , bicker , bicker .
GUSSIE: Hello . Who ? Miss Blandings , there 's a Mr. Funkhauser wants to see you .
MURIEL: Funkhauser ? Oh , Mr. Funkhauser !
GUSSIE: That 's what he says .
MURIEL: Uh better ask him to come up .
GUSSIE: Says to come up .
MURIEL: Oh uh darling , Mr. Funkhauser 's here .
JIM: Who ?
MURIEL: You remember , Bunny Funkhauser , that clever young interior decorator we met at the Collins ' cocktail party ?
JIM: What 's he doing here ?
MURIEL: Well , I imagine he 's brought the uh estimates .
JIM: Estimates ?
MURIEL: Darling , you know how long we 've said we 've got to do something about this apartment , and , well , he called last week , and I had him come over , and he 's got some simply wonderful ideas !
JIM: There could n't be two Bunny Funkhausers , could there ?
MURIEL: Why , no , dear .
JIM: Then this is the same clever young man who 's responsible for that zebra- striped monstrosity in the Collins ' living room ?
MURIEL: That couch is terribly functional .
JIM: Phil Collins told me what he paid for all that function ! If you think I 'm going to SOUND of doorbell ringing .
MURIEL: Darling , please ! Children , you 'll be late to school . Run along and
JOAN: Miss Stellwagon says that functionalism in modern furniture
MURIEL: Never mind , dear .
FUNKHAUSER: Good morning .
THE GIRLS: Hi .
MURIEL: Good morning , Mr. Funkhauser . You emember Mr. Blandings ?
FUNKHAUSER: But of course .
JIM: Muriel !
MURIEL: Jim , just wait till you hear . He 's got some wonderful ideas for the foyer .
FUNKHAUSER: Oh , that 's out ! All out ! Changed the whole thing ! I just could n't live with it ! I said to myself , `` Bunny , what are the Blandings ? How shall we do them ? '' And the answer was perfectly obvious . Very American , very grass oots , very blueberry pie that sort of thing .
JIM: Mm .
FUNKHAUSER: Now first , let 's dig into this living oom of yours , it 's really a dreary .
MURIEL: We want this room to be very gay , dear . Something in bright reds , yellows and greens .
JIM: Red , yellow and green ? !
FUNKHAUSER: Oh , come , Mr. Blandings , let 's not un away from color .
JIM: Not running away just backing off a little .
FUNKHAUSER: Uh yes . Now as I see our room , it 's definitely Colonial . You know , cobbler 's bench , eakfront , pie cooler , student lamp , hooked rug . But everything in good taste . It must not jump out at you and scream `` Look see how antique I am ! ''
JIM: Heaven forbid .
FUNKHAUSER: Of course , these things take imagination . You 've simply got to be able to visualize .
JIM: If you 'll forgive me , Mr. Funkhauser , what I 'd like to visualize at this dreary hour is how much is this all going to cost ?
FUNKHAUSER: Well , really , I hesitate to say . After all by the time this wall is out we may find
JIM: This wall is what ?
FUNKHAUSER: Out . Source of light is from the east . Obviously if our room is to have any function at all
JIM: You 're going to tear out the wall ? !
MURIEL: Dear , it 's a wonderful notion .
FUNKHAUSER: Visualize three feet of leaded panes , the rest
JIM: Can you give me a figure ?
FUNKHAUSER: Well ! Costs are n't what they used to e , you know , and
JIM: Just a figure .
FUNKHAUSER: Materials are impossible , labor has just run wild
JIM: Just an overall figure .
FUNKHAUSER: Well ! I should n't like to be tied down . But I suppose if you must have a figure , I 'd say mm somewhere in the neighborhood of seven .
JIM: Mm Seven .
FUNKHAUSER: Mm .
JIM: That would be seven thousand ?
FUNKHAUSER: Mm . Jim looks at Muriel , considers .
JIM: We-ll . That seems fair . After all , we 're not running away from color and we are tearing out walls Mr. Funkhauser , do you have a card ?
MURIEL: Jim , we have n't even discussed the est of the house .
JIM: We will , dear .
FUNKHAUSER: Well , really , I
JIM: We 'll talk it all out and then we 'll get in touch with Bunny . CAMERA TRUCKS with them to the door .
FUNKHAUSER: Well , really , I mean , I was unde the impression we 'd come to some decision today .
JIM: I 'm sure we will .
FUNKHAUSER: We-ll !
JIM: So nice of you to come . Good day .
MURIEL: Now darling , you you just do n't go to a man like Funkhauser and ask how much it 's going to cost before you even know what he 's going to do !
JIM: No , that would be too logical ! Seven thousand dollars ! Blueberry pie ! I would n't put seventy-five cents into this broken-down rat trap !
MURIEL: It 's our home , Jim . Betsy was practically born in this apartment .
JIM: That does not make it a national shrine ! Seven thousand dollars and not one word about closets .
MURIEL: Closets ! You would n't even let him get to the bathroom !
JIM: I have n't got that kind of money !
MURIEL: The way you talk , Jim Blandings , you 'd think I was some kind of congenital idiot !
JIM: Sometimes I 'm beginning to wonder !
MURIEL: You can just get out of here !
JIM: That 's not a bad idea !
JIM: Sorry . His secretary enters .
MARY: Good morning , Mr. Blandings .
JIM: 'Morning .
MARY: You wanted to see the color copy from this month 's House and Stream .
MARY'S VOICE: Will that be all ?
JIM: Hm ?
MARY: Will that be all ?
BETSY'S VOICE: `` Forced to sell . Farm dwelling , oak grove , apple orchard , trout stream , hay fields , four barns , original eams `` As he looks up thoughtfully
BILL'S VOICE: Well , that 's the way it all started . The ad was enough to convince Jim
BILL'S VOICE: But Muriel was a little tougher . I guess the corsage did it .
BILL'S VOICE: There they are , two little fish from New York out in the deep deep waters of Connecticut real estate . That 's Smith , the real estate salesman . Mighty shrewd cookie in a quiet sort of way . Never thought he 'd get a bite this quick . Smith looks speculatively at the Blandings .
BILL'S VOICE: Uh-uh , not yet . Smith firmly shakes his head `` no . ''
BILL'S VOICE: Take it easy , Smith , give 'em a little more line . Smith shakes his head `` no '' .
BILL'S VOICE: Now we 're ready to gaff 'em .
SMITH: Well , folks , there she is the old Hackett Place .
SMITH'S VOICE: Fifty mighty pretty little acres
MURIEL: It 's simply charming !
JIM: Of course , you understand , Mr. Smith , we 're just window shopping , so to speak . Nothing really definite in mind .
SMITH: Perfectly all right .
JIM: Mm . Not a bad-looking place , but it 's certainly a lot older than anything we had in mind .
SMITH: She 's no spring chicken but that 's just what makes he such a buy .
JIM: You do n't say ! How 's that ?
SMITH: First year she was built , General Gates stopped right here to wate his horses .
JIM: Oh ! Old General Gates Civil War .
SMITH: Revolutionary War .
JIM: Oh . Oh , that General Gates . Hea that , honey , General Gates !
MURIEL: Would n't that make the house over a hundred years old ?
SMITH: Hundred and seventy come next April .
JIM: Mm .
JIM'S VOICE: Hm . Wonder what he meant by `` steal ? ''
SMITH: And I guess I do n't have to tell you , Mrs. Blandings , what a woman 's touch could do to a place like this .
MURIEL: Well
MURIEL'S VOICE: It is a nice old house . It just needs someone to love it , that 's all .
SMITH: Yes , sir , you 've certainly got to visualize .
MURIEL: Well I suppose as long as we 're here
JIM: I guess it does n't hurt to take a look .
MURIEL: It does have possibilities . Do you think we can get it ?
JIM: Like taking candy from a baby .
MURIEL: Now do n't lose your head .
JIM: Shh . Just keep quiet and let me handle this . As they enter the house
MURIEL: It 's wonderful , Jim ! That maste edroom with those two closets !
JIM: Shh !
MURIEL: Funkhauser could do wonders with this
JIM: Funkhauser will have nothing to do with this house ! Shh !
HACKETT: Hi , George !
SMITH: Hi , Eph ! What do you know , it 's Eph Hackett , owner of the place !
JIM: Well , you do n't say .
SMITH: Eph , this is Mr. and Mrs. Blandings from New York City .
HACKETT: Howdy .
THE BLANDINGS: How do you do ?
MURIEL: You certainly have a lovely place here , Mr. Hackett .
HACKETT: Ye-ap .
JIM: Mr. Hackett , we 've just been talking to Smith here about uh taking the old place off your hands .
HACKETT: Ai n't for sale ! As the Blandings react with dismay
SMITH: Why do n't you folks just go out in ack and take a look at the orchard ?
HACKETT: How 'm I doin ' , George ?
SMITH: Nice timin ' , Eph . Think we got something here .
HACKETT: They the same people you showed it to in nineteen-thirty-eight ?
SMITH: They were lookers this is the eal thing .
HACKETT: If they got five thousand dollars on 'em . do n't let 'em get away .
SMITH: They already offered ten .
HACKETT: Y'do n't say What 's my asking price ?
SMITH: Fifteen
HACKETT: A mite stiff
SMITH: I 've got 'em measured . They 're gon na take the place for eleven thousand .
HACKETT: Make it eleven thousand five hundred fifty .
SMITH: Odd kind of figure .
HACKETT: Might as well take the commission out of them instead of me . As Smith raises a knowing eyebrow
JIM: `` Home , home in Connecticut With a closet to hang up your petticut ''
MURIEL: Jim ?
JIM: `` No hustle or fuss No Fifth Avenue us ``
MURIEL: Uh Jim ?
JIM: Hm ?
MURIEL: I was just wondering , dear . Ten thousand dollars is such an awful lot to offer
JIM: Like say a lawyer ?
MURIEL: Well , Bill knows about these things and
JIM: Muriel , for once in my life I 'm going to make one small decision , on my own , without the legalistic machinations of Mr. Bill Cole .
MURIEL: It seems very peculiar that when your very best friend happens to be one of the very cleverest young lawyers in New York City
JIM: Muriel , I do n't want to hear anothe word about Bill Cole ! Well , did your mother tell you about the house ?
BETSY: Yes .
JIM: Well ?
JOAN: Miss Stellwagon says the current craze for modernizing old farmhouses is a form of totem worship .
JIM: Did it ever occur to you two that there may be some remote , intangible subjects upon which your Miss Irma Stellwagon is not the final authority ?
JOAN: Why do n't we buy a Solaxion house ?
JIM: You know it 's just barely conceivable What kind of a house ?
JOAN: Solaxion . It 's built on a mast like a tent and it revolves with the sun .
JIM: Oh , it revolves with the sun ?
JOAN: That 's right .
JIM: Who lives next door Buck Rogers ? !
JOAN: It 's the only practical way to live . When a new model comes out you trade the old one in like a used car .
JIM: Muriel
MURIEL: Children , you have n't even seen this house yet .
BETSY: Personally , I 'd like a Crane Mobile home . It comes all folded up and all you do is plug it in for electricity and water and
JIM: Now just a minute ! What kind of children are these ? Do you want to spend the rest of your lives in chromium tents and portable merry-go-rounds ? This house was built before our country became a nation . It has dignity . It 's it 's Gussie enters with a letter .
GUSSIE: Special delivery , Mr. Blandings .
JIM: From Smith !
MURIEL: Well ?
JIM: `` I have conveyed your offer of ten thousand dollars to Mr. Hackett and am sorry to say he is not interested . However , I feel ''
MURIEL: Oh , dear . Maybe we should have gone a few dollars higher .
JIM: He 's bluffing . Simple as that .
JOAN: For ten thousand dollars we could get a Rockford Trailer and a Zamboni Power Unit . It 's kitchen , bathroom and air conditioning all rolled up into Jim gives her a weary look , turns to Muriel .
JIM: Muriel , I 'll let him push me to ten thousand , two hundred , but not a penny more !
SMITH'S VOICE: `` Dear Mr. Blandings While your offe of ten thousand two hundred is still not acceptable to Ephemus Hackett
JIM'S VOICE: `` Dear Mr. Smith You may inform Mr. Hackett that the very highest I could possibly go ``
SMITH'S VOICE: `` Dear Friend Blandings ``
JIM'S VOICE: `` My dear Friend Smith ``
SMITH'S VOICE: `` Dear Blandings ! ''
JIM'S VOICE: `` Dear Smith - ! ''
JIM: What do you think , Bill ? Steal , huh ?
BILL: It certainly is . Jim looks triumphantly at Muriel .
JIM: Well , it was n't much , Bill . I just saw a good thing and I What do you mean ?
BILL: Every time you get a little tight you weep on my shoulder about the advertising business and how it forces a sensitive soul like yourself to make a living by bamboozling the American public . I would say that a small part of this victimized group has now edressed the balance .
JIM: What are you talking about ?
BILL: You ! You 've been taken to the cleaners and you do n't even know your pants are off !
MURIEL: Dear , I told you . I said we should call Bill
JIM: Never mind , Muriel ! All right , just what 's wrong with this deal ?
BILL: First time around you offered ten thousand dollars for fifty acres , ight ?
JIM: What of it ?
BILL: That 's two hundred dollars an acre . I know that part of Connecticut and one hundred dollars an acre is standard top-gouge price to city slickers . When the natives sell to each other it 's around forty or less .
MURIEL: Forty dollars an acre !
JIM: The man 's entitled to a fair profit .
BILL: Not two hundred and eighty-fou percent . And besides , you 're not getting fifty acres , you 're only getting thirty- five , more or less .
JIM: Where does it say that ?
BILL: I refer to a rather obscure post- script on the back of the second letter from Friend Smith . He hands the letter to Muriel .
MURIEL: `` Incidentally , Mr. Hackett has been a little over-optimistic about the acreage . It will probably survey somewhere in the neighborhood of thirty-five acres , more or less , but I feel sure ''
JIM: All right , so it 's thirty-five ! What 's the difference ? Do you know how many tennis courts you can get on thirty- five acres ?
BILL: You 're not spending eleven thousand five hundred dollars for tennis courts !
JIM: That 's not the point !
BILL: That 's precisely the point . We 're going to write this Hackett a strong letter and tell him he can eithe kick in with those fifteen acres , educe the price , or find anothe sucker .
JIM: We 'll do no such thing ! I 'm not going to queer this deal over fifteen broken- down acres !
MURIEL: We were just going window shopping and so far it 's cost us eleven thousand five hundred dollars and they even made us pay the commission !
JIM: You do n't understand business .
BILL: You mean extortion .
MURIEL: I wonder if we could get another two year lease on the apartment ?
JIM: Now wait a minute ! You ca n't measure everything on a slide rule . This house has certain intangibles .
BILL: Like what , for instance ?
JIM: Like antique value , for instance ! It just so happens that General Gates stopped right there , at that very house , to water his horses .
BILL: I do n't care if General Grant dropped in for a scotch and soda you 're still getting rocked !
JIM: That was a different war !
MURIEL: I think Bill 's absolutely right .
JIM: Let me explain something . To both of you . For fifteen years I 've been cooped up in a four room cracke ox ! Just getting shaved in the morning entitles a man to the Congressional Medal for bravery .
BILL: That does n't make this a good buy .
JIM: Bill Muriel and I have found what I am not ashamed to call our Dream House . It 's like a fine painting . You buy it with your heart , not you head . You do n't ask , how much was the canvas , how much was the paint ? You look at it and you say , `` It 's eautiful I want it , '' and if it costs a few pennies more you pay it and gladly because you love it and you ca n't measure the things you love in dollars and cents !
MURIEL: Our house . Our home . Our thirty-five acres They tenderly kiss .
BILL: more or less On Jim 's reaction
JUDGE QUARLES: `` thence along said stonewall fence forming the East boundary of said Lansdale Road , N 20° 27 ' E , 21.84 feet to the end of said stonewall fence , thence along a wire fence , N 16° 31 ' W , 78.66 feet to a dead twenty- inch chestnut tree , thence westward to said stonewall fence , to a total of thirty-one and a half acres ``
JIM: What was that ? How many acres ?
BILL: Thirty-one and a half .
JIM: I was under the impression you property was thirty-five acres , Mr. Hackett .
HACKETT: It is more or less . Bill looks significantly at Jim .
SMITH: You see , Mr. Blandings , when you signed the purchase agreement it was subject to traced map attached . Surveyed to an even thirty-one and a half acres .
JUDGE QUARLES: Anything wrong ?
BILL: It 's nothing , Your Honor , just a few less tennis courts .
JUDGE QUARLES: `` to have and to hold to him , the said Grantee , his heirs and assigns to his and their own proper use and enefit forever . ''
SHRUNK MILLS: 2 Mi . They pause , turn , go through the bridge .
BILL: Congress ought to pass a law . When a man buys a house in Lansdale County there 's a prize he gets ten percent off if he can find it .
JIM: What in the world are `` Shrunk Mills ? ''
BILL: They are probably mills that have shrunk .
MURIEL: Well , you certainly are n't much of a help .
BILL: Look you really want to find that house of yours it 's no problem . They look at him curiously .
BILL: Well , I must admit it 's a very eautiful thing .
MURIEL: The house and the lilac are just the same age , Bill ; if the lilac can live and be so old , so can the house . It just needs someone to love it , that 's all .
BILL: It 's a good thing there are two of you one to love it and one to hold it up . As Jim gives him a look
JIM: Who needs engineers ? This is n't a train , you know .
BILL: I just saw it move .
JIM: This house has been standing since the second year of the Continental Congress . You take one look at it and shingles start to fall off !
BILL: Look let me do you a favor . I 've got a client , crackerjack structural engineer , Joe Apollonio ; he practically built the George Washington Bridge single-handed .
JIM: Thanks a lot , but we 're not building a bridge .
BILL: He 's the follow who advised the Government not to raise the Normandie they did n't listen to him , cost them five million dollars .
JIM: You have my word , if I were raising the Normandie , I would n't make a move without Apollonio . Now would you like to come inside and look around ?
BILL: No thanks , I 'll just stay out in the car and listen to `` Life Can Be Beautiful . ''
MURIEL: I think you 'd better contact Mr. Apollonio .
MURIEL: It has charm , has n't it , Mr. Apollonio ?
APOLLONIO: Uh-huh .
JIM: Of course , any small changes would have to conform with the characte of the countryside .
APOLLONIO: Mm-hmm .
MURIEL: And yet still be functional .
APOLLONIO: Uh-huh .
JIM: Well , uh , what 's your professional opinion ?
APOLLONIO: Tear it down .
JIM: Tear it down ? ? !
APOLLONIO: If your chimney was shot and you sills was okay , I 'd say go ahead , fix her up . If your sills was shot and your chimney was okay , again I 'd say go ahead , fix her up . But you sills are shot and your chimney is shot .
JIM: Thanks a lot .
APOLLONIO: It 's okay . He tips his hat , walks out of scene .
JIM: Bill Cole and his experts !
MURIEL: Darling , we 'll get our own experts .
BILL'S VOICE: And so they got their own experts . Mr. Simpson said
SIMPSON: Tear it down . The Blandings look at each other .
BILL'S VOICE: On the other hand , Mr. Murphy said
MURPHY: I think you 'd better tear it down . The Blandings smile feebly .
BILL'S VOICE: And then just to be a wee bit different , Mr. Jones said
JONES: Tear it down ! The Blandings are now considerably shaken .
BILL'S VOICE: And that 's how our friend , Mr. Simms , came into it .
SIMMS: Of course you could fix up that old house . You can fix up any structure that 's still standing . The sills and floors could n't be worse , I grant you , and I guess you 'd have to jack up that west corner at least three feet to make it level . Need new chimney . New roof . Complete new plumbing . Too bad you did n't buy it ten years ago . Could have fixed it up in jig time then , and it would have made some sense .
JIM: Uh-huh mm-hmmm uh-huh .
SIMMS: Fact is , before you 're through , it would be less expensive to tear the old place down and build a new one , same size .
JIM: Mm . New house New house .
MURIEL: You mean for the same money we could build a brand new house ?
SIMMS: It certainly would n't cost any more .
JIM: Hm New house
SIMMS: Well , I imagine the type of house you 'd want would be something in quiet good taste , two story , frame and brick veneer construction modern , but of course fitting in with the architectural traditions of the countryside .
JIM: Well , I What do you think , Muriel ?
MURIEL: I think it sounds fine .
SIMMS: Perhaps you 'd like to see a basic floor plan something like this .
MURIEL: It 's very nice , I 'm sure , but uh well does n't it seem just a little it conventional ?
JIM: Yes , Simms , if we were going to build a house we want it well , you know just a little bit different .
SIMMS: Yes , of course .
JIM: Now , for instance
JIM'S VOICE: here in the study if we could just push out this wall a little and put in a built-in bar we could
MURIEL'S VOICE: Excuse me , dear
JIM'S VOICE: And closets , Simms , lots of closets . If there 's one thing this family needs , it 's closets .
SIMMS' VOICE: If I might make a suggestion But Muriel 's hand reaches the pencil first .
MURIEL'S VOICE: And bathrooms , Mr. Simms . Each bedroom must have at least one bathroom .
SIMMS' VOICE: But that would be four bathrooms , Mrs. Blandings I think I 'd better point out to you
JIM'S VOICE: Just a minute . Do you think we might manage a little playroom in the basement , nothing tremendous , you know , something like this
SIMMS' VOICE: Well , it 's always possible , but at the moment our fundamental problem But Muriel 's hand has the pencil .
MURIEL'S VOICE: And I 've always wanted a little sewing oom upstairs You know , a little utility room where I can be alone , and sew , or sulk , o on a rainy afternoon
JIM'S VOICE: Pardon me , dear . On that playroom , Simms , not too small . You know , plenty of room for ping-pong , darts , nice ig poker table
SIMMS' VOICE: If you do n't mind , I
MURIEL'S VOICE: And off the kitchen , I 'd like a little flower sink just to putte around in
JIM'S VOICE: And a terrace off the study , with an owning and little outdoo fireplace
SIMMS: We-ll let 's just see what we have here . In the first place
SIMMS' VOICE: I 'm afraid you 've got the upstairs about twice as big as the downstairs .
JIM'S VOICE: It 's all those bathrooms .
MURIEL'S VOICE: It is not , it 's all those closets .
SIMMS: By extending this breakfast room you 've eliminated the possibility of any stairs going to the second floor .
JIM: Oh , you can just shove those stairs in anywhere .
SIMMS: And , Mrs. Blandings , on that sewing oom , the way you have it now , the chimney stack would come up right through the middle of the room , leaving you with something in the shape of a square doughnut . Which , of course , might be very warm in winter , but otherwise of doubtful utility .
MURIEL: You could always move the chimney somewhere else , could n't you ?
SIMMS: We-ll Look , I think I know just about what you two have in mind . Why do n't I go ahead with some preliminary plans and
JIM: You do that , Simms , but remember , we 've got to hold it down to ten thousand .
SIMMS: That , I can tell you right now , is impossible . Even with a considerable trimming of the things you 've indicated , I do n't see how we can ing it in for less than twelve o twelve-five .
JIM: Twelve-five ! Well , I guess we 're not going to quibble about a few pennies one way or the other .
MURIEL: No , you 'll find Mr. Blandings neve quibbles about pennies .
SIMMS: And uh have you any notions about how you 'd like the old place taken down ?
JIM: Why do n't we just blow on it ?
SIMMS: There 's a good local house wrecker . I 'll have him contact you .
JIM: Fine . You just shoot ahead with those plans , and remember , try to keep it down to ten , ten-five .
SIMMS: Well we 'll try . As the Blandings walk to the door
JIM: There 's one good thing about getting that old relic down . Those original eams and everything this time somebody pays us . As they go out the door
HACKETT: Them beams is worth money . You payin ' him , or he payin ' you ?
WRECKER: He 's payin ' me .
HACKETT: How much ?
WRECKER: A thousand .
HACKETT: A thousand !
WRECKER: He squawked , but he paid .
HACKETT: Hmm . I guess maybe I got a little somethin ' comin ' too . As he starts out of scene
VOICE: Okay , boys , let her go !
JIM: Well , so far it 's cost us thirteen thousand , three hundred and twenty- nine dollars and forty-five cents .
MURIEL: But we 've got the nicest vacant lot in the state of Connecticut . They exchange a look of mixed emotions .
SIMMS' VOICE: Something will have to give somewhere , that I know . The CAMERA ANGLE WIDENS to disclose
MURIEL: It 's impossible . I do n't see how we can cut another inch .
JIM: Honey , you heard Simms . As the house stands now it 's over fifteen thousand dollars !
MURIEL: Well , it just does n't seem possible for a house with such small rooms .
SIMMS: Mrs. Blandings , I 've already explained . It 's not only the size of the rooms so much as it is the number . You see , our primary problem is one of cubage
JIM: That 's right , dear , cubage .
MURIEL: What 's that ?
JIM: Oh just a figure of speech .
MURIEL: But what does it mean ?
JIM: Cubage . It 's just the number of cubic feet that go into a cubic foot . Go on , Simms .
SIMMS: Now is it absolutely essential fo each of your daughters to have he own room with two closets and a separate bath ?
JIM: Yes . You see , er , my daughters are , er , approaching womanhood , and , er
SIMMS: I had n't realized they were approaching it quite so fast . Perhaps what you need is not so much a house as a series of little ungalows .
JIM: Hmmm . What about that silly flower sink ? We could eliminate that .
MURIEL: I beg your pardon .
JIM: Or that sewing room upstairs , that 's certainly a waste .
MURIEL: If we 're going to eliminate anything , we 'll lose that ridiculous play room in the basement with that great big poker table .
JIM: Honey , I 've got to have some elaxation .
MURIEL: We 've got thirty-one and a half acres . Go out in the back and do a little gardening .
JIM: Sure , and get poison ivy !
SIMMS: If I may interrupt , I 'd like to suggest that none of these are really major eliminations . Now if we could do with one less bathroom on the second floor
MURIEL: I 'm sorry . We could n't possibly .
SIMMS: Mrs. Blandings , a simple bathroom , eight by ten by eight with grade A fixtures will cost around thirteen hundred dollars .
MURIEL: I refuse to endanger the health of my children in a house with less than four bathrooms .
JIM: For thirteen hundred dollars they can live in a house with three athrooms and rough it !
SIMMS: Look , perhaps the most practical thing would be
BETSY: Oh , look , we 're in the Lansdale paper ! `` Historical Society Blasts Vandalism ! ''
JIM: Muriel , Simms explained to you . We 've just got to cut , cut What 's that ?
BETSY: `` Censure Vote Passed re Destruction of Famed Hackett Edifice . ''
JIM: Well , is n't that just too bad ! Let me see that .
MURIEL: What 's so funny .
JIM: Prutty . Mrs. Bildad Prutty . Get a load of this ! `` The semi-monthly meeting of the Lansdale Historical Society was turned into an uproar last night when its president , Mrs. Bildad Prutty '' How do you like that , Bildad Prutty ? `` reported the total demolition by its New York buyer of the historic old Hackett house . '' Bildad Prutty ! Muriel , I 've got to send this to the New Yorker !
BETSY: Read on , father .
JIM: `` Mrs. Prutty , '' Bildad , that is `` reminded her audience that several years ago the Society started to aise a fund to purchase and restore the old house to its original condition . ''
BETSY: Read on , father .
JIM: `` The project fell through by being seven hundred dollars short of the sum of twenty-six hundred dollars '' `` which Ephemus Hackett testified was the lowest reasonable price he could accept as `` The paper drops .
BETSY: And what did we pay , father ?
JOAN: Eleven-five , with the commission .
JIM: Muriel , is n't it time for those children to be in bed ?
MURIEL: Now girls , I do n't want to tell you again . The front doorbell rings .
JIM'S VOICE: Twenty-six hundred dollars !
SIMMS' VOICE: I would n't be too concerned about Mrs. Prutty and her committee . Afte all , it 's your property and if you want to tear it down
MURIEL: Why , Bill !
BILL: Hello , Muriel . Well , you 've done it again ' . Once , just once , why do n't you come to me and find out if it 's all right , if it 's legal , before you go barging off and run yourself smack into another jam !
JIM: What 's eating you ?
BILL: And I must say , Simms , I hold you equally responsible !
JIM: What ? What happened ?
SIMMS: I 'm afraid I do n't understand .
BILL: Did you let this idiot tear down that house ?
JIM: What if he did ? What of it ?
SIMMS: Reconstruction was unsound and totally impractical .
BILL: I quite agree . But you 're dealing with a man who does n't think before he acts , who goes off half-cocked !
JIM: What is it ? What did I do ?
BILL: You 're an architect ! You must have een aware of the legality involved .
JIM: What ? What legality ?
BILL: You knew there was a mortgage on that house .
SIMMS: I assumed as much .
JIM: What happened ? What are you talking about ?
BILL: And you know the requirements in egard to a mortgage where there 's demolition intended !
SIMMS: Certainly . But since you were his lawyer , I naturally assumed
BILL: With a man like this you ca n't assume anything !
JIM: Just one minute ! I am entitled to know what I did ! This is America ! A man 's guilty until he 's proven innocent
BETSY: It 's the other way around , father .
JIM: You go to bed !
MURIEL: Girls !
JIM: Bill , I 've had a very trying day . Would you mind telling me in clear , concise English just what crime I 've committed and why ? !
BILL: In clear , concise English , you tore down a house on which another man holds a mortgage without first getting his written permission .
JIM: Well , I I did ? !
BILL: And in such case , the mortgagee can demand the full payment of said mortgage upon demand and Mr. Ephemus Hackett so demands ! Six thousand clams ! And he wants them now !
JIM: Now ? !
BILL: You 've got ten days . Jim gulps . Pause .
JOAN: For six thousand dollars we could have had a Solaxion house and a Crane Mobile home .
JIM: Muriel !
MURIEL: Girls , say your good nights and off to bed without another word .
BETSY: Good night , Mr. Simms . Uncle Bill .
JOAN: Miss Stellwagon says the problems of the parents should be the problems of the children .
MURIEL: You keep that in mind , dear . It 'll help prepare you for motherhood . The children exit . An embarrassed pause .
SIMMS: Perhaps we 'd better let the plans go for the time being and
JIM: No , Simms , I 'll work this out . You go ahead with your final plans and let 's see some estimates .
MURIEL: And we 'll just forget about that extra bathroom .
SIMMS: Very well . You 'll hear from me as soon as possible . Good night .
JIM: Six thousand dollars ! Bill looks at Jim with compassion .
BILL: What 'll you do for collateral on your building loan ?
JIM: I do n't know , turn in my insurance policies or something .
MURIEL: Now , Jim , you ca n't do that .
JIM: Why not ?
MURIEL: What if something should happen ? You ca n't leave the children unprotected .
JIM: I 'm not dead yet ! And if I die , there 's plenty left to take care of them .
MURIEL: Not if you cash in your policies . As Jim reacts with painful resignation
BILL: I 'm sure it wo n't be necessary . I 'll see the boys at the bank . Maybe you can put up your insurance as collateral . If necessary , I 'll sign a personal note .
JIM: Thanks , Bill .
BILL: And Jim , do me a little favor . The next time you 're going to do anything , or say anything , or buy anything , think it over very carefully , and when you 're sure you 're right forget the whole thing . Good night , Muriel .
MURIEL: Good night , Bill .
JIM: What 's with this kissing all of a sudden ?
MURIEL: What 's that ?
JIM: Just because a man is helpful in a usiness way , it does n't give him extra-curricular privileges with my wife !
MURIEL: That 's a fine thing to say about a friend of fifteen years !
JIM: Well , I do n't like it . Every time he goes out of this house , he shakes my hand and he kisses you .
MURIEL: Would you prefer it the other way around ? !
JIM: Well , I do n't like it , that 's all ! Why is he always hanging around ? Why does n't he ever get married o something ?
MURIEL: Because he ca n't find another girl as sweet and pretty and wholesome as I am .
JIM: Well it it does n't look right . There are limits to friendship and
MURIEL: Darling , let 's not be silly about this . It 's not Bill , it 's the house you 're upset about .
JIM: I suppose so . They kiss .
MURIEL: Of course , darling . We 're not just uilding a house it 's a home . A home for ourselves and our children and maybe our children 's children .
JIM: It 's getting awfully crowded with only three bathrooms .
SIMMS: Well here are the estimates . Before you look at them , I think I 'd bette explain
JIM: Do n't bother , Simms . I 'm getting to be an old hand at this sort of
SIMMS: Now obviously these bids are way out of line , that is , all except John Retch and Son at twenty-one thousand .
MURIEL: Twenty-one thousand !
SIMMS: And with some judicious cutting , I think we can pare that down to eighteen .
MURIEL: We 've only asked for the barest necessities
SIMMS: Frankly , with all the extras you two have
JIM: Never mind . If you 'll just send us a bill fo your services , I 'll see that it 's taken care of . Now , if you 'll excuse us .
MURIEL: Where are we going ?
JIM: I am going out to get my head examined ! Then , if I do n't jump off the Brooklyn Bridge , I 'm going to find the owner of our building and sign a twenty-year lease !
JIM: Well , things are certainly humming .
BILL: What 's that ?
JIM: I said , humming .
BILL: Oh .
JIM: That 's Mr. Tesander . He 's digging our well .
BILL: Well ? What happened to the trout stream , with that pure , clear , cold mountain water ?
JIM: I decided against it
MURIEL: It was n't exactly a decision , dear . We discovered the trout stream dries up in August and the rest of the year it 's polluted .
JIM: Well , anyway , I 'd rather have artesian water . It 's healthier . Calcium vitamins artesian
BILL: What 's wrong with that steam shovel ? They look off .
JIM: Better take a look .
MURIEL: Jim !
JIM: What 's the matter , Mr. Zucca ? Something wrong ?
ZUCCA: How do you lika that ? Broka my bucket . Two times this week I broka my bucket ?
JIM: What did you do , strike a boulder ?
ZUCCA: Atsa no boulder , atsa ledge .
JIM: What does that mean ?
ZUCCA: Meansa we got ta blast !
JIM: Blast ?
ZUCCA: Blast . Witha dynamite .
JIM: What do you mean , dynamite ?
MURIEL: What do you mean , `` What do you mean ? '' Mr. Zucca just explained . He 's going to use dynamite and blast until he gets rid of the rock .
ZUCCA: Atsa no rock , atsa ledge .
BILL: What Mr. Blandings means is what precisely is a ledge ?
ZUCCA: Ledge . Lika bigga stone , only a- igger .
JIM: Like a boulder ?
ZUCCA: No , like ledge . Jim looks at Muriel and Bill .
BILL: Like a ledge .
ZUCCA: But you do n't got ta worry . Only cost twenty-four cents a cubic foot , plussa dynamite an ' a fuse .
JIM: But how far will you have to blast ?
ZUCCA: Harda tell . Might be a lilla baby ledge mighta run the whole toppa the mountain .
JIM: At twenty-four cents a foot ? Do you ealize what that means ? !
ZUCCA: Meansa we got ta blast . Zucca walks off .
JIM: Well , anyway , our house will neve sink .
MURIEL: If it does , we can always get Mr. Apollonio . He raised the Normandie . There is a crash from the well-digging rig .
BILL: `` Come to peaceful Connecticut Trade city soot for sylvan charm . '' Another crash .
JIM: How long does that go on ?
MURIEL: I do n't know . Three weeks now at four dollars and fifty cents a foot .
JIM: I think I 'd better have a little talk with Mr. Tesander .
TESANDER: Yep ?
JIM: How 's it coming ?
TESANDER: It 's comin ' .
JIM: No no I mean But he 's drowned out by the motor .
TESANDER: Yep ?
JIM: What I meant was how far down are you ? Tesander looks at his equipment , considers .
TESANDER: Oh 'bout a hundred and ninety feet .
JIM: Well is n't that pretty deep ?
TESANDER: Yep .
JIM: Do you think maybe you 'd better try another spot ?
TESANDER: Up to you .
JIM: I mean well , have you hit anything yet at all ?
TESANDER: Hit some limestone yesterday .
JIM: Is that good ?
TESANDER: That 's bad .
JIM: That 's bad ?
TESANDER: That 's good .
JIM: Oh
TESANDER: 'Course it might turn out to be sandstone .
JIM: That 's bad ? Tesander shakes his head , `` No . ''
TESANDER: Ca n't tell . Might be good . Might be ad . One thing you know you got plenty of shale , sandstone and limestone .
JIM: I see .
BILL: On a hot day there 's nothing like a nice cool limestone shower .
MURIEL: Mr. Tesander , just for the record , of course , what ever happened to water ?
TESANDER: Oh , it 's there , all right . Just got to be patient .
BILL: If you ask me , this project 's getting a little out of hand .
JIM: Nothing 's getting out of hand at all . I 've made a chart of the whole operation , and with a few minor deviations , I know exactly what every penny 's going to cost .
MURIEL: Two pennies .
JIM: And just what does that mean ?
BILL: Meansa we got ta blast .
JIM: You see , Mary , the average fellow who builds a house does n't know where he stands from day to day but I do things a little differently . With a few minor deviations I know exactly where every penny is going
BILL: Hi .
JIM: Bill ! Come in , come in .
BILL: Just going over the Knapp contracts with old man Dascomb and I uh Can I talk ?
JIM: Sure . What 's up ?
BILL: While I was in there with Dascom the conversation kind of got around to you and uh
JIM: What is it ?
BILL: Well , he did n't say in so many words that ever since you started with that house you have n't turned in a decent piece of copy , but
JIM: But you kind of got the feeling
BILL: that if I told you , you 'd know that he knew that you knew that he knew that you knew or something .
JIM: What 's he worrying about ? The deadline 's three months off . I 've always The phone rings . Mary answers .
MARY: Hello ? Yes . Just a minute . Mrs. Blandings calling from Lensdale .
JIM: Yes , Muriel . What ? What 's that ? Tesander struck water ! Say that 's wonderful ! We 've finally got our well .
BILL: Congratulations .
JIM: Huh ? What 's that ? What do you mean we 've got two wells ? I 'll be right out . Come on , Bill , we 'd better get out to Lansdale .
MARY: Anything wrong ?
JIM: Mary , have you ever seriously considered building a house ?
MARY: Well , no offense , Mr. Blandings , but my boy friend says that anybody who uilds a house today is crazy .
JIM: You stick with that boy , he 's got a great future . As he and Bill start for the door
JIM: You mean you hit a spring , a bubbling spring right here in our cellar ?
SIMMS: It 'll have to be diverted before Retch here can lay his cement .
RETCH: May take a while . Pumps are over in Jersey .
TESANDER: Tsk , tsk , tsk .
JIM: Water , Mr. Tesander .
TESANDER: Yep .
JIM: At six feet !
TESANDER: Yep .
JIM: And over there , just thirty-two yards away , you had to go down two hundred and twenty-seven feet to hit the same water .
TESANDER: Yep .
JIM: How do you account for that , Mr. Tesander ?
TESANDER: We-ll , way it seems to me , Mr. Blandings , over here the water 's down around six feet and over there it 's uh
BILL: What 's this , another closet ?
JIM: This happens to be our dining room .
MURIEL: Not the dining room , dear , the living oom . There 's the fireplace .
JIM: Then where 's the dining room ?
BILL: Maybe it 's that little room off the hallway .
JIM: That 's the breakfast nook .
MURIEL: It 's not the breakfast nook , it 's the powder room .
JIM: Oh .
BILL: Do me a favor do n't ever invite me here for a meal .
FIRST WORKMAN: I do n't figure this Blandings at all . If you got ta build on the windiest hill in Connecticut , why do you have to pick the windiest side of the hill ?
BILL: You know these New York millionaires they 're eccentric . The workmen pass from view .
JIM: I think I 'd like to go outside .
BILL: After you , Rockefeller . As they enter the foyer , a carpenter appears .
CARPENTER: Just the man I want to see . Would you step over here a second ?
JIM: Sure .
BILL: I 'll browse around upstairs .
CARPENTER: On them second floor lintels between the lally columns , do you want we should rabbet them or not ?
JIM: The second floor lallys ?
CARPENTER: The second floor lintels , between the lallys .
JIM: Oh . Oh , the lintels between the lallys ?
CARPENTER: Yeah . From the blueprints you ca n't tell . You want they should be abbeted ?
JIM: Un umm . No , I guess not .
CARPENTER: Okay , you 're the doctor . Hey , fellas , you got any of them abbeted lintels set , rip 'em out !
JIM: It sounded less expensive to say no .
MURIEL: Stop it ! Stop it !
VOICE: Okay , fellas , let 's quit !
JIM: Now look what you 've done .
WORKMAN: It 's Saturday , mister . We quit at twelve o'clock . This ai n't a chain gang , you know .
MURIEL: I 'm just sick . From the outside this house looks like a grain elevator , and on the inside everything 's miles too small .
JIM: What 's what ?
MURIEL: That noise listen . It 's coming from the closet !
JIM: What happened ?
BILL: The door blew shut . I got locked in .
JIM: Impossible . I had this closet built especially for myself . The lock opens from the inside .
BILL: Maybe for Houdini not for me . As Bill starts to step out , Jim detains him .
JIM: Nothing to it . A child could work it . Look , I 'll show you .
MURIEL: You know , dear , it 's just possible the lock worked for you and not fo Bill .
JIM: Ridiculous . Even you could do it .
MURIEL: Thank you .
JIM: Come on , I 'll show you .
JIM'S VOICE: Go ahead , dear , just open it .
MURIEL'S VOICE: I do n't seem to be able to -
JIM'S VOICE: Here , let me show you ! You just take the knob and turn it clockwise .
BILL: Nothing like that good old Yankee know-how .
JIM: Hey ! Hey ! Somebody let us out of here !
MURIEL: Oh , dear . Jim and Bill look out .
BILL: Leave a call for seven o'clock . Monday morning .
JIM: If I could just get over to that scaffolding He tests the window frame , finds it solid .
MURIEL: What are you going to do ?
JIM: Do n't get panicky , I 'll get you out of here . Here , hold this over the window .
BILL: Roger .
MURIEL: In case of emergency break glass . Come on , Bill .
JIM: Funny always worked before . Huh . I wonder
JIM: `` Home , home in Connecticut Where you have to conform to local traditions , customs , politics and etiquette ''
JOAN: Dad , do you suppose I could have a chemistry lab in the basement ?
JIM: Sure , why not ?
BETSY: I think it 's awful . Smelling up the house with those horrible chemicals .
MURIEL: Never mind , Betsy . Dear , I 'm going up to the place this afternoon to see about landscaping . Bill 's driving me .
JIM: That 's nice . What do you mean , Bill 's driving you ?
MURIEL: Why do you always say , `` what do you mean , '' when you know perfectly well what I mean and what you mean ?
JIM: I mean that every time I turn my ack Bill Cole 's driving you some place or something .
MURIEL: He 's only being helpful .
JIM: I thought he was a lawyer ! Why is n't he out suing somebody ?
JOAN: Bicker , bicker , bicker .
MURIEL: Another word and you do n't get you laboratory .
BETSY: Well , that 's something !
JIM: We 'll just see about that !
MURIEL: What is it , dear ?
JIM: Mr. William Cole , please . Hello , Bill ? I want you to fight this thing ! I know my rights as a citizen ! They ca n't get away with it ! What do you mean , what am I talking about ? The letter , of course . From the owner of this building . They want us to move ! It 's a thirty day notice ! But that 's ridiculous . How can I move into a house that is n't even finished ? ! No windows , no plaster or paint , or or plumbing ! Now you listen to me ! I have no intention of moving in thirty days ! This is not legal ! I 'm going to fight this thing ! And I do n't care if it takes every penny I 've got ! Yeah Yeah Yeah All right !
MURIEL: Well ?
JIM: We 're moving in thirty days . On Muriel 's reaction
BILL'S VOICE: So-came thirty days and they moved .
BILL'S VOICE: Well , there she is , bright and shining and just about complete the esidence of Mr. and Mrs. James H. Blandings .
BILL'S VOICE: Do n't mind me , buddy , I just got through varnishing that floor .
JIM: Where 's Simms ?
WORKMAN: Around back trying to figure out what to do about them windows .
JIM: What 's the problem ? You put windows up .
WORKMAN: Not these . They do n't fit .
JIM: Oh , they do n't , do n't they ?
RETCH: Oh , Mr. Blandings , you 'd better look these over .
JIM: What 's this about the windows ?
SIMMS: I 'm afraid there 's a little slip-up . These windows seem to belong to a Mr. Landings in Fishkill , New York . I talked to Mr. Landings this morning .
JIM: Well , has he got mine ?
SIMMS: No , he seems to have some windows that belong to a Mr. Blandsworth of Peekskill .
JIM: Where are my windows ? !
SIMMS: As near as we can figure out they 've either been sent to a Mr. Benton in Evanston , Illinois , or a Mr. Bamberge of Phoenix , Arizona .
JIM: What are we supposed to do live the rest of our lives in a house without windows ?
SIMMS: It 'll just be a matter of a few days .
BILL: What 's a `` Zuz-Zuz Water Soft-N-R '' ?
JIM: How should I know ?
BILL: You 've got one .
JIM: `` Furnishing and installing one Zuz- Zuz Water Soft-N-R , two hundred and eighty dollars ! '' I will not have any such piece of equipment in my house !
SIMMS: I 'm afraid I authorized that , Mr. Blandings to save your boiler and water pipes .
JIM: From what ? !
SIMMS: Rust . The plumbing man assures us the water from your well is the most corrosive in his entire experience in the trade .
BILL: Another first !
JIM: Mm . Well , if it 's necessary , put it in ! We 're moving in today , you know and
RETCH: It 's in .
JIM: Oh . Then get me the bill for it !
BILL: You 've got it .
JIM: All right then .
MURIEL: Now I want the living room to be a soft green . Not quite as bluish as a robin 's egg , but yet not as yellow as daffodil uds .
PEDELFORD: Mm .
MURIEL: The best sample I could get is a little too yellow , but do n't let whoever mixes it go to the othe extreme and get it too blue . It should just be sort of a grayish yellow green .
PEDELFORD: Mm-hmm . They turn to the dining room .
MURIEL: Now the dining room I 'd like yellow . Not just yellow , a very gay yellow .
PEDELFORD: Mm-hmm .
MURIEL: Something bright and sunshiny . I tell you , Mr. PeDelford , if you 'll just send one of your workmen to the A & P for a pound of their best butte and match it exactly , you ca n't go wrong .
PEDELFORD: Mm .
MURIEL: This is the paper we 're going to use here in the foyer . It 's flowered but I do n't want the ceiling to match any of the colors of the flowers . There are some little dots in the background , and it 's these dots I want you to match . Not the little greenish dots near the hollyhock leaf , but the little bluish dot between the rosebud and the delphinium blossom . Is that clear ?
PEDELFORD: Mm-hmm .
MURIEL: The kitchen 's to be white . Not a cold , antiseptic hospital white a little warmer but not to suggest any other color but white .
PEDELFORD: Mm .
MURIEL: Now for the powder room , I want you to match this thread . You can see it 's practically an apple ed . Somewhere between a healthy Winesap and an unripened Jonathan .
PEDELFORD: Mm . There is a crash from the kitchen .
MURIEL: Will you excuse me ?
PEDELFORD: Got it , Charlie ?
CHARLIE: Green , yellow , blue , white , red .
PEDELFORD: Check .
MURIEL: Joan , you know father was to take care of the heavy dishes .
JOAN: He disappeared . I have n't seen him for an hour .
BETSY: Where 's Uncle Bill ? I just checked the timetable he 's going to miss his train .
MURIEL: If they 've run off somewhere it certainly is n't very
JIM: I thought you were going to take care of it .
MURIEL: I thought you were .
BETSY: You 're going to miss your train , Uncle Bill ! It leaves Lansdale in twenty-five minutes .
BILL: Is n't there a later one ?
BETSY: Not till the Commuter 's Special tomorrow morning at six-fifteen .
JIM: You mean seven-fifteen .
BETSY: No , Dad , six-fifteen .
JIM: What about the seven-fifteen I 'm supposed to take to the office every morning ? !
BETSY: There 's a little asterisk . The seven- fifteen only runs Saturdays , Sundays and holidays .
JIM: Let me see that ! Muriel !
MURIEL: Oh , dear , do n't tell me I read it wrong .
JIM: That 's fine ! For the rest of my life I 'm going to have to get up at five o'clock in the morning to catch the six-fifteen , to get to my office by eight , which does n't even open until nine and which I never get to until ten !
MURIEL: Perhaps if you started earlier you could quit earlier .
JIM: So I could get home earlier to go to ed earlier to get up earlier !
BILL: Maybe you can have the railroad push the train up to four-fifteen then you wo n't have to go to bed at all !
BETSY: Uncle Bill , you 're going to miss your train !
MURIEL: Jim , you clean up this mess . I 'll drive Bill to the station and pick up some cold cuts for dinner .
BETSY: You 'd better hurry !
BILL: Kind of hate to leave that little place . Just four walls and a couple of mothballs , but to me it 'll always e home .
JIM: So long , Bill . Bill and Muriel exit .
JOAN: It 's certainly going to be fun this summer when Uncle Bill comes up fo his vacation .
BETSY: We 'll get in a lot of doubles .
JIM: Hmm ? What are you talking about ? Bill 's going to Europe .
BETSY: No , he 's not . I heard him and mothe talking . He 's going to move his vacation up and take a place in Lansdale .
JIM: Uh-huh Mm-hm . Mm-hm Uh-huh . All right , come on , come on . Get usy .
MURIEL: I 'll scout around and find you a place in Lansdale . Now , you 're not going to change you mind about coming up ?
BILL: Do n't worry , I 'll be on the job .
MURIEL: It wo n't be easy . I promise you a Cook 's tour of every lamp maker , rug weaver , and antique shop in Lansdale County .
BILL: When I married you two I suppose I took you for better or for worse .
MURIEL: Good old Uncle Bill .
BILL: Good old Uncle Bill . As they exchange an understanding smile
JIM: Now look what you 've done !
BETSY: Father , the first principle of lighting a fire is to see if the flue is open . A three-year-old child knows that .
JIM: Next time we want a fire I 'll send out for a three-year-old child ! Get that stuff cleaned up and go in and help Gussie set the table . It 's getting late .
JOAN: Look , Dad , your fraternity pins .
JIM: Pins ? I only had one .
JOAN: There are two of them here .
JIM: All right , all right . Just put them away .
JOAN: Funny , this one says W.C. on the ack . W.C. ? William Cole ! It must be Uncle Bill 's !
JIM: Huh ? Let me see that . Hmmmm .
JOAN: What 's that ?
BETSY: Mother 's diary when she was in college . It 's slightly torrid .
JOAN: Let 's see .
JIM: That 's none of your business !
BETSY: I 'd say mother and Uncle Bill were somewhat of an item !
JIM: People do not read other people 's diaries ! It 's not a very nice thing to do ! Now go in there and help Gussie with the table .
BETSY: What about ?
JIM: I 'll take care of that . Now , shoo , shoo .
MURIEL: Where are you going ?
JIM: To shave .
MURIEL: Tonight ? ?
JIM: While I can still trust myself with a razor . At six o'clock in the morning I 'd probably cut my throat . Goodnight .
MURIEL: Excuse
JIM: Muriel , do you have to do that now ? !
MURIEL: There 's no need to be so irritable just because you have to shave at night .
JIM: I 'm not irritable !
MURIEL: Well , you 're certainly something ! You have n't said a civil word all evening .
JIM: Sometimes a man does n't feel like talking .
MURIEL: What is it , dear ? Something down at the office ?
JIM: No .
MURIEL: Have you got the new slogan fo `` Wham '' ?
JIM: It 's not due yet !
MURIEL: Well , it 's something . You 're certainly upset about something . I can always tell .
JIM: I 'm not upset . It 's just that I do n't happen to approve of falsehood and deception . Particularly in my own wife .
MURIEL: What are you talking about ?
JIM: Oh , nothing . It 's just that I distinctly remember your telling me you gave back Bill 's fraternity pin fifteen years ago . Muriel looks at him , puzzled .
MURIEL: Did I , or did n't I what ?
JIM: Give it back to him .
MURIEL: Of course I did . If I said I did , I did .
JIM: Then perhaps you 'd have the goodness to explain how this happened to fall out of your jewel box ?
MURIEL: You ! You 're jealous ! You 're standing there with your face full of soap and you 're jealous .
JIM: If you were so crazy about the guy , why did n't you marry him ? !
MURIEL: Because I was n't in love with him !
JIM: That 's not what you said in you diary !
MURIEL: Oh , now you 've been reading my diary !
JIM: Well it happened to fall open and I happened to look at it . It just happened .
MURIEL: I 'll just bet !
JIM: It 's all over the book so why do n't you admit it ? You were in love with Bill Cole !
MURIEL: Do n't be absurd ! Of course I was in love with Bill . In those days I was in love with a new man every week .
JIM: Then why did you marry me ?
MURIEL: I 'm beginning to wonder ! Maybe it was those big cow eyes of yours or that ridiculous hole in your chin ! Maybe I knew that some day you 'd bring me out to this thirty- eight thousand dollar icebox with a dried-up trout stream and no windows ! Or maybe I just happened to fall in love with you but for heaven 's sake , do n't ask me why !
JIM: Muriel ? No reaction .
MURIEL: I do n't know . Jim gently turns her around facing him .
JIM: Well I am . I acted like a schoolboy and I 'm sorry . Muriel looks at Jim . Finally she smiles .
MURIEL: Oh , Jim !
JIM: Why do I love you so much ? Jim again kisses her tenderly , warmly .
MURIEL: Darling , it 's awfully late . Jim kisses her again , a little more ardently .
JIM: What for ? The windows are all open anyway .
MURIEL: Jim , you have to get up at six o'clock .
JIM: Yes , I guess so .
MURIEL: Goodnight , dear .
JIM: Goodnight .
BILL'S VOICE: And so the days sped by and the ills and the extras and as the house approached forty thousand dollars , Jim approached his deadline for the new slogan . It was almost a photo finish .
JIM: You 'd better send out for coffee and sandwiches , It looks like an all night session .
MARY: What did he say ?
JIM: Tomorrow morning .
MARY: Well , I guess you 'll just have to dream something up good or bad .
JIM: I rather got the impression it had etter be good .
MARY: Oh .
JIM: Funny how you look forward to the little things . Rain , for instance . Mary looks at him curiously . He turns to her .
MURIEL: Thank heavens ! The children .
BILL: Stay put . You look too comfortable .
MR. JONES: Whew ! What a night ! I 'm Jones , from down the road . Just came over to tell you your kids are all right , Mr. Blandings .
BILL: Oh , I 'm not Mr. Blandings . Cole 's the name , Bill Cole .
MURIEL: I 'm Mrs. Blandings .
JONES: How do . Mrs. Williams just called . Says your phone 's out of order . Wanted me to tell you the water 's rising and they 've got the bridge roped off . Girls 'll spend the night ove at her place .
MURIEL: Thank you . I was beginning to get concerned . Can I make you a cup of tea ?
JONES: No , thanks . Better be gettin ' back 'fore I have to swim for it . 'Night , Mrs. Blandings . 'Night , Mr. Bl
BILL: Cole . Bill Cole . Friend of the family . Just came in out of the rain .
JONES: Well 'Night .
MURIEL: Goodnight and thanks so much .
BILL: That 's fine . No bridge . How do I get ack to Lansdale ?
MURIEL: You 'll just have to spend the night ight here . As they start back into the living room
BILL: Muriel , really ! With your husband in New York and your children away think of my reputation .
MURIEL: Do n't worry , Snow White , you 'll be as pure and unsullied in the morning as you were the night before .
BILL: That 's the story of my life .
MURIEL: Poor Jim , he sounded so worried efore . I certainly hope he comes up with something .
BILL: Do n't worry about the man who gave the world `` When you 've got the whim , say Wham ! '' This well will neve un dry .
JIM: `` Compare the price , compare the slice , Take our advice Buy Wham ! ''
MARY: It 's Boyle Petroleum . `` If you 'd buy etter oil , You 'd better buy Boyle . ''
JIM: `` This little pig went to market As meek and as mild as a lamb . He smiled in his tracks When they slipped him the axe He knew he 'd turn out to be Wham ! '' A long silent look passes between them .
MARY: Where are you going ?
JIM: Home , to get some sleep and I 'd advise you to do the same .
MARY: But but you have n't
JIM: Suppose I have n't ! This is n't the only job in town !
MARY: But but what 'll I tell Mr. Dascomb ?
JIM: You just tell him to to You just tell him ! He exits .
JIM: 'Morning , dear .
MURIEL: Darling , you must be exhausted . How did it go ?
JIM: Fine . Fine . They kiss .
MURIEL: Is everything all right ?
JIM: Everything 's fine . Hello , Simms , what brings you out with the morning dew ?
SIMMS: Just dropped by to check the lueprints . Some extras came in from Retch this morning and there 're a couple of things I thought we ought to go over together .
JIM: Really . What are they ?
SIMMS: Well , let 's see . Few little things here , all right , I guess . `` Mortising five butts a dollar sixty-eight . ''
JIM: Let 's not quibble about that . A man 's entitled to mortise a few butts now and then .
SIMMS: Extra nails and screws three dollars , eighty-nine cents .
JIM: Petty larceny , but let him get away with it .
SIMMS: Now there 's one here I frankly do n't understand . Ah , here we are . `` Changes in closet , twelve hundred and forty-seven dollars . '' Did you authorize that ?
JIM: Well , we probably told him to Twelve hundred and what ? !
SIMMS: Forty-seven dollars . Changes in closet .
JIM: Who does he think we are ! What 's this notation `` Refer to Detail Sheet Number one thirty-five ? ''
SIMMS: Far as I remember , that would be something in the back of the house . Let 's just take a look .
JIM: Oh Mrs. Blandings ' little flowe sink .
SIMMS: You did n't authorize any changes , did you ?
MURIEL: Well they certainly were n't changes .
JIM: What have you done ?
MURIEL: I have n't done anything ! And what I did was just nothing at all .
JIM: What have you done ? !
MURIEL: Well All I did was one day I saw fou pieces of flagstone left over from the porch that were just going to be thrown away because nobody wanted them and I asked Mr. Retch if he would n't just put them down on the floor of the flower sink and poke a little cement between the cracks and give me a nice stone floor where it might be wet with flowers and things . That was absolutely all I did .
JIM: That 's all you did ?
MURIEL: Absolutely . Just four little pieces of flagstone .
SIMMS: Did you by any chance authorize a drain ?
MURIEL: Of course I did n't . All I said was I wanted a nice stone floor and Mr. Retch was just as nice as could be and said , `` You 're the doctor , '' and that 's all anybody ever said to anybody about anything . Jim takes a deep breath , turns to Simms .
JIM: Well ?
SIMMS: All right , I think I can tell you what happened . First , the carpenters had to rip up the flooring that was already laid . Those planks run unde the whole width of the pantry , so Retch had to knock the bottom out of the pantry wall to get at them .
SIMMS' VOICE: Then he had to chop out the tops of the joists under the flower sink space to make room for a cradle . I guess he bought some iron straps and fastened them to a big pan to give him something to hold the cement . What with that added load on the weakened joists , I 'll bet he had to put a lally column down there fo support , too .
MURIEL: It was just four little pieces of flagstone , and I only -
JIM: Quiet !
SIMMS: Well , the main soil pipe runs unde there on wall brackets , so Retch had to get his plumbing man back to take out a section so he could get that cradle set . I guess that meant he had to change the pitch of the soil pipe from one end of the house to the other . 'Morning , Mr. Cole .
BILL: 'Morning . Hello , Jim .
JIM: Hello , Bill .
MURIEL: The bridge was roped off and Bill had to stay last night .
JIM: Oh .
BILL: Slept like a rock .
JIM: I 'm delighted . Jim looks at Bill , then back at Muriel .
SIMMS: And then , of course , there are hot and cold water pipes hooked to the joists right under that pantry . They go up to the wing bathroom on the second floor , and I 'll bet my bottom dollar he had to relocate them .
SIMMS' VOICE: And I guess the electrician had to ip out about sixty feet of armored cable between the main panel and the junction box by the oil burner , including the two hundred twenty volt cable that goes to the stove .
GUSSIE: 'Morning , everybody . Whew ! What a night !
JIM: Where have you been ?
GUSSIE: Lansdale . Could n't get back across the bridge .
JIM: You were n't here last night ?
GUSSIE: They were n't letting anybody across that bridge , Mr. Blandings . I passed the girls over at the Williams . They 'll be along any minute . As Jim reacts
MURIEL: Thank you , Gussie . You 'd better get eakfast started . As Gussie exits , Muriel turns to Simms .
BILL: We were at the two hundred twenty volt cable that goes to the stove .
JIM: Just a minute . You mean the children were n't here last night either ?
MURIEL: How could they be , dear ? The bridge was closed .
JIM: I just came across it .
MURIEL: Well , it was closed last night .
JIM: It 's open now ! Embarrassed pause .
BILL: If you 'll all excuse me I I think I 'll just go up and slip into something a little more comfortable .
SIMMS: Well , that 's about the size of it
JIM: All right , Simms , all right . We 'll take care of it .
SIMMS: I 'll admit it 's a little steep . But I 'll try to get Retch to knock a hundred dollars off the bill . If I ca n't get that , I 'll certainly try for seventy-five .
JIM: Fine .
SIMMS: If he does n't go for seventy-five , I 'll take a stab at fifty .
JIM: You do that .
SIMMS: Anyway , I 'm almost sure we can get twenty-five . There is no answer .
MURIEL: Now dear , you 're upset , you 've got a lot of things on your mind
JIM: Muriel , there 's only one thing on my mind This house and how fast we can get rid of it !
MURIEL: That 's not what you 're thinking .
JIM: Maybe it 's not . Maybe I 'm thinking I was once a happy man ! I did n't have a closet , I did n't have three bathrooms , but I did have my sanity , a few dollars in the bank , two children who loved me and a wife I could trust !
MURIEL: That 's a fine thing to say !
JIM: I also had a job at Danton and Bascomb , something I do n't happen to have at the moment !
MURIEL: Jim !
JIM: That 's right , I 've resigned ! We 're starting all over again ! From scratch ! And without this house !
MURIEL: You love this house !
JIM: I hate it !
MURIEL: You do n't mean that .
JIM: Every word of it ! Anybody who builds a house today is crazy ! The minute you start , they put you on the list . The All-American Sucker list ! Everywhere you turn they 've got a hand in your pocket . If you take out their hands , they find more pockets ! It 's a conspiracy , I tell you , a conspiracy against every man and woman who want a home of their own ! Against every boy and girl who were ever in love ! Tesander clears his throat . Jim turns .
TESANDER: Well , Mr. Blandings , there 's a matte of twelve dollars and eighty-six cents .
JIM: Twelve dollars and eighty-six cents ! Why be a piker , Mr. Tesander ? Take everything I 've got ! Spread it out among your pals ! Would n't Retch like a little something ? Maybe Zucca could use my new dinner jacket ? It 's open house , Mr. Tesander ! Help yourself ! If this is n't enough I 'll come over to you place and do some odd chores . Maybe I can mow your lawn or scratch you ack !
TESANDER: You do n't understand , Mr. Blandings . This twelve dollars and eighty-six cents you do n't owe me , I owe you . There is a momentary pause .
JIM: W-what was that ?
TESANDER: Found I overcharged you . Almost three feet .
MURIEL: Thank you very much , Mr. Tesander .
TESANDER: Well , I guess I 'd better be gettin ' along . Sure got a pretty place here . I 'll tell Mr. Zucca about the dinne jacket .
BILL: Oh , Mr. Tesander could you give me a lift to town ?
TESANDER: Yep .
BILL: Be right with you .
MURIEL: What did you mean before about losing your job ? Will we really have to sell the house ?
JIM: I do n't know , dear I do n't know . Bill enters .
BILL: In case anyone 's interested , I 'm leaving for town . If you want to count the silverware , I 'll wait .
JIM: Bill , be patient with me . Maybe one of these days I 'll grow up .
BILL: What happened to him ?
MURIEL: Twelve dollars and eighty-six cents .
BILL: Mind if I say something ? Jim and Muriel look at him curiously .
BETSY: 'Morning , everybody !
JOAN: Hi , Dad ! How come you 're not at the office ?
JIM: I 'm on a kind of a vacation .
JOAN: You mean you got fired ?
JIM: Well , not exactly , I
MURIEL: We 'll discuss it later . Gussie 's head appears from the kitchen .
GUSSIE: Come and get it ! Breakfast everybody .
BETSY: Good ! I 'm starving ! What are we having , Gussie ?
GUSSIE: Orange juice , scrambled eggs and you- know-what .
JOAN: Ham ?
GUSSIE: Not ham Wham ! If you ai n't eatin ' Wham , you ai n't eatin ' ham ! Gussie 's head disappears .
JIM: What did she say ?
JIM: Drop in and see us sometime .
MR. BROOKS: and Wisdom to know the difference .
MAN: I could go on and on about what a great guy Earl is , how he cuts his toe nails Everyone laughs .
MR. BROOKS: Thank you all very much . The first thing I would like to say is I do n't even know how I cut my toe nails . Applause and laughter from the Audience .
EMMA: You could see her nipples . At he age she should keep those things hidden .
MR. BROOKS: She called . She has mid terms coming up .
EMMA: She 's dropping out , you know .
MR. BROOKS: We 'll see .
EMMA: Nothing she does is wrong to you , is it ? Mr. Brooks does n't rise to the bait .
MARSHALL: Come on , Earl , give yourself a eak , you know you want to do this .
MR. BROOKS: No .
MARSHALL: You 're the fucking 'man of the year ' , you deserve it . It 's not like it 's not set up . You already know how to by-pass the alarm , you know how to pick the locks . Tonight 's the perfect night .
MR. BROOKS: No , Marshall , I said 'no ' !
MARSHALL: I heard you , Earl , but you do n't mean 'no ' . Emma feels Mr. Brooks 's distance .
EMMA: What 's the matter ?
MR. BROOKS: Nothing .
EMMA: You were frowning .
MR. BROOKS: I was thinking of what I did n't say in the speech .
EMMA: They laughed , they were touched , I do n't think anyone felt left out .
MARSHALL: They have their dance class tonight . What if we go by and just look at them . There 's no harm in just having a look .
MR. BROOKS: No means 'no ' , Marshall .
MARSHALL: Please pretty please .
MR. BROOKS: The food tonight was very good , but I was n't crazy about the dessert . Would you like to stop somewhere and get something sweet ?
EMMA: Labradors are supposed to be nice , or maybe a rescue mutt
MR. BROOKS: The Pound 's a pretty sad place ; if you want me to , I 'll go with you .
EMMA: There 's an Irish Lab I read about , and I think the breeder is
MARSHALL: I bet your dick 's getting hard , is n't it , just imagining what they would look like dead ? Savoring the ice-cream , Mr. Brooks nods .
MR. BROOKS: I ca n't do this , I ca n't do this , I ca n't do this , please do n't let me do this , God grant me the Serenity to accept the things I can not change In the DRESSING AREA
EMMA: Okay , I 'm going to read . If I 'm not awake , wake me when you come back .
MR. BROOKS: I thought you were wonderful tonight .
MARSHALL: Oh Lordy , Earl my boy , I 've missed this ! We are going to have so much fun !
MR. BROOKS: This is the last time , Marshall . Understand me ? ! The very last time !
MARSHALL: Do n't you dare quit on me , you piece of shit . I want to see what they 're doing .
MR. BROOKS: Hello .
MAN: What the fuck ? ! Then he sees the gun .
MR. BROOKS: Be quiet and sit up .
MARSHALL: These pigs liked to fuck with the linds open , you should have known that , Earl . This is a big mistake for you , Earl .
MR. BROOKS: Almost like I want to get caught , huh , Marshall ?
MARSHALL: Well , do n't fucking do that . I do n't think either of us would enjoy spending the rest of ou lives in jail or a lethal injection .
MR. BROOKS: Yes , sir .
MARSHALL: Do n't even think about it . You know the rules .
OLDER DETECTIVE: Where the fuck is Atwood ? !
YOUNG DETECTIVE: I called ten minutes ago , they said she was on her way .
OLDER DETECTIVE: She does n't get here soon , these odies wo n't even be dead anymore ? A Uniformed Cop standing guard at the tape
COP: You looking for the lady Cop ?
OLDER DETECTIVE: Yeah .
COP: She 's here . She 's been sitting in her car right over there for the last half hour .
OLDER DETECTIVE: Oh , Christ .
DETECTIVE ATWOOD: I really hated yesterday , Snyder , and then today came along .
YOUNG DETECTIVE: Eh I I do n't know , I heard it was because you were drunk and got into a fight with a fish tank .
DETECTIVE ATWOOD: Who are you gon na believe ? Me o the fucking fish ? !
YOUNG DETECTIVE: Eh you .
DETECTIVE ATWOOD: Good . Atwood turns and leaves the Men .
YOUNG DETECTIVE: She 's nuts !
SNYDER: And rich .
SNYDER: There are some scratches in the side door cylinder . Other than that no signs of forced entry . The alarm was armed and we even had to cut the security chains to get in .
DETECTIVE ATWOOD: This guy has n't been active fo over two years She enters the house .
SNYDER: That 's why we called you . You 're the God that tells us peons if we have a simple murder here o something we can dump on you .
DETECTIVE ATWOOD: Bite yourself .
SNYDER: So we have a copycat ?
DETECTIVE ATWOOD: Where are the thumbprints ?
SNYDER: That 's what it looks like .
DETECTIVE ATWOOD: What 's that ?
SNYDER: The bullets went completely through the victims . The killer recovered the slugs .
DETECTIVE ATWOOD: Were these open or closed when you got here ?
SNYDER: Closed .
DETECTIVE ATWOOD: Hmm
SNYDER: So this one 's yours .
DETECTIVE ATWOOD: I do n't fucking need this .
SNYDER: Only a few of them are home , they say they did n't see anything . We checked the whole neighborhood , so far nobody saw a thing . Atwood nods and turns back to the bodies .
DETECTIVE ATWOOD: Leaving them like this , he must have been angry at them for some eason .
DETECTIVE ATWOOD: I 'll bet you a hundred bucks , Snyder , there is no bag in that vacuum cleaner .
SNYDER: I have no idea what you 're looking for .
DETECTIVE ATWOOD: He vacuumed the house and took the ag .
SNYDER: Oh , shit . That is scary smart .
DETECTIVE ATWOOD: Okay .
MAN: Detective Tracy Atwood ?
DETECTIVE ATWOOD: Yes .
MAN: This is for you .
DETECTIVE ATWOOD: You fucking asshole ! ! I 'm in the middle of a fucking murde investigation ! !
MAN: Hey , take it easy lady , I 'm just the messenger .
DETECTIVE ATWOOD: Goddamit ! !
SNYDER: What is it ?
DETECTIVE ATWOOD: My soon to be ex-husband 's scumbag lawyer is trying to show me how painful she can make my life if I do n't give them what they want .
SNYDER: This is not the Doctor .
DETECTIVE ATWOOD: The doctor was a couple years ago . This one is my stupid mistake .
LEADER: Are there any new members ? A WOMAN comes forward .
WOMAN: Hi , my name is Vaughn and I 'm an alcoholic .
MR. BROOKS: Hi , my name is Earl and I 'm an addict .
MARSHALL: You 're such a fucking hypocrite . If you were honest you would step out there and say 'Hi , I 'm Earl . I killed two people last night and I eally got off on it , but I need your help to be cured . '
MR. BROOKS: I 'm different Marshall , I wo n't argue that with you . This is the only place that has ever helped me e normal and I 've been straight up until last night for the past two years . I 'm not going to kill again and I 'm not going to quit coming here because it upsets you .
MARSHALL: Yeah but for the next 29 days you 're going to have to step out there and say 'Hi , I 'm Earl , I 'm an addict . ' And everybody will know you fell off the wagon . Do n't you feel stupid doing that ?
MR. BROOKS: No . I feel good .
MR. BROOKS: This is not the top of the line o the bottom , but for the money we 're talking about this is the quality I can provide you .
PA SYSTEM: Mr. Brooks , your daughter is waiting for you in your office .
MR. BROOKS: We 'd love to work you with on the design . It 's fun to challenge our machines . If you check around , you 'll find we 're not the cheapest , ut we are the best .
SUNDAY: I would have given you that message , Mr. Brooks . She has boxes and suitcases downstairs .
MR. BROOKS: Hold my calls .
JANE: I 'm sorry , Daddy , please do n't be angry with me .
MR. BROOKS: I can guess what you 've done , but why do n't you tell me and then I 'll decide .
JANE: I dropped out of school .
MR. BROOKS: Okay . Have you told your mothe this ?
JANE: No . I wanted to speak to you first .
MR. BROOKS: You 'll have to tell her , I 'm not going to do that for you , and then together the three of us will decide where to go from here .
JANE: I 've thought a lot about this , Dad . College is a waste of time for me .
MR. BROOKS: I do n't know how you know that half way through your Freshman year , ut
JANE: You did n't go to college , Dad , and you 're successful . I want to come and work for you . Sitting on the couch
MARSHALL: She 's not telling you everything , she 's hiding something .
MR. BROOKS: I know . I 'm not hiring right now .
JANE: Just listen to me . What would happen to the business if , God forbid , something happened to you ? Mom would probably have to sell to strangers . I 'm willing to start at the bottom , you can treat me as a egular employee , I want to learn everything there is to know about unning the box business , and then when the time comes , the business would stay in the family .
MR. BROOKS: That 's sweet , but you 're talking about emotion , not business . In fact your mother and I came very close to selling out last year .
JANE: What ? !
MR. BROOKS: If we had been offered a little more money , and they may come back to us , we will sell .
JANE: What would you do without ? ! There 's a knock on the door .
MR. BROOKS: Yes ?
SUNDAY: I 'm sorry , I know you did n't want to be disturbed , the Man in the waiting room insisted I give you this . She hands Mr. Brooks a letter-size envelope .
SUNDAY: He said you would find what 's inside very interesting .
MR. BROOKS: What is he ? A salesman ?
SUNDAY: He wo n't say . I 've never seen him efore . I can tell him to go away if you want me to .
MR. BROOKS: That 's okay .
JANE: I 'll talk to Mom , but I 'm not going ack to school .
MR. BROOKS: Where would you live ?
JANE: To save money I would move back home , but no rules , no curfew , I want to be treated like an adult .
MR. BROOKS: Would you pay for your food , would you pay rent ?
JANE: No , dad , you 're a very wealthy man , you can afford to keep me . Mr. Brooks presses his Intercom .
MR. BROOKS: Sunday , would you show the gentleman who gave you the envelope to the conference room , and tell him I 'll meet him there and What happened to the BMW ?
JANE: A friend is driving it across country , it 'll be here next weekend .
MR. BROOKS: And get Jane a cab .
JANE: Are you going to give me a job ?
MR. BROOKS: If it were up to me , and I think your mother will agree with this , you should go back to school .
MR. BROOKS: That 's why I did n't want to do the dance Couple !
MARSHALL: Stop your fucking whining , Earl , you enjoyed doing that Couple just as much as I did , and look on the ight side , he came to us he did n't go to the Cops . If he tries to shake us down we kill him . Period . We make it fun but we kill him . End of story .
MR. BROOKS: What can I do for you , Mr ?
MAN: Let 's say , 'Smith ' .
MR. BROOKS: Okay , Mr. Smith . Mr. Brooks motions him to a seat .
MR. BROOKS: Then these are the only copies of these photos and you have no others .
MR. SMITH: No . I have other copies and othe photos , and if something were to happen to me
MR. BROOKS: How did you find me , Mr. Smith ?
MR. SMITH: You 're 'Man of the Year ' , Mr. Brooks . Your picture was in the paper . If it had n't been , I do n't know what I would have done .
MR. BROOKS: Lucky me . What is it that I can help you with ?
MR. SMITH: I 've been watching that Couple fo months , they liked to make love with the blinds open . Sometimes I would take pictures , you know , visual aides for later . It was fun , it was a great way to get off ; I thought , until I saw you kill them . I have to tell you I have neve ever felt a rush like that ever . I know you 're the Thumbprint killer , you 've done this before . What I want is to go with you the next time you kill someone . And I would like that to be soon .
MARSHALL: And you were worried that this was going to be unpleasant . The answe is simple . Just tell him you 've decided never to kill again and he 'll go away .
MR. BROOKS: You enjoy watching me suffer , do n't you ?
MARSHALL: In a word , yes .
MR. BROOKS: Where do you think he has the othe pictures ?
MARSHALL: He put them in a safety deposit box ut I 'll bet the box is at the bank where he has his checking account and the key is on his keychain . He eally wants to do this , he 's not going to go to the cops .
MR. SMITH: So do we have a deal ?
MR. BROOKS: From the angle of these pictures you live on the third floor of the apartment building across the alley from the Couple 's house .
MR. SMITH: Well eh .
MR. BROOKS: Yes or no , Mr. Smith ? Mr. Smith nods 'yes ' .
MR. SMITH: Six thirty , seven , depending on the traffic .
MR. BROOKS: You can never come here again , you can never call me . Do you understand that ?
MR. SMITH: Yes .
MR. BROOKS: Tomorrow night , not tonight , tomorrow night , at eight o'clock , leave your apartment and walk east . I 'll pick you up .
MR. SMITH: If you 're thinking of doing anything to me , Mr. Brooks
MR. BROOKS: We 're both aware of the rules , Mr. Smith , but I feel I must warn you . If it turns out that you enjoy killing , it can become very addictive . It could ruin your life .
MR. SMITH: I want to do this .
MR. BROOKS: Have I covered everything ?
MARSHALL: I ca n't think of anything else . Mr. Brooks stands up and opens the door .
MR. BROOKS: I 'll see you tomorrow night , Mr. Smith .
ASIAN ATTORNEY: We 've talked to our client and we 've come up with a number that we feel is more than fair .
SHEILA: We told you at the beginning what we want and that has n't changed .
ASIAN ATTORNEY: Your client knew Detective Atwood was a homicide detective when he married her .
SHEILA: But he had no idea of the mental anguish that being in close proximity to her work would cause him .
DETECTIVE ATWOOD: What about the mental anguish I went through being in close proximity to him . Who 's gon na pay me for that ?
ASIAN ATTORNEY: We do n't need to get into this , Tracy .
DETECTIVE ATWOOD: Yes , we do . I was the one who paid for everything while we were married , and now I 'm being asked to give him a bonus for spending time with me when I 've already paid fo it in the first place .
JESSE: Tracy , this is not a lot of money for you , and you know how upset I was when Meeks said that he was going to escape and he would come ack and kill you .
SHEILA: We 're quite willing to find out what a court would think that mental anguish is worth .
DETECTIVE ATWOOD: Jesse Darling ? you know the est thing that could happen to me ight now ? That you get hit by a truck and die .
SHEILA: That 's it ! Mr. Vialo and I are leaving . You 've threatened my client , we 're going to ask for a restraining order , and we 'll see you in court .
DETECTIVE ATWOOD: Fuck it . It felt good .
MR. SMITH: Ahhh ! ! ! Ahhh ! ! ! Ahhh ! ! !
MR. BROOKS: Do n't worry , if I were here to kill you , you would already be dead .
MR. SMITH: Mr. Brooks ? He squints into the black .
MR. BROOKS: It 's nice to have you home . He leaves .
EMMA: Ask your daughter what the real eason is she dropped out of school .
JANE: I keep telling you it 's not the eason .
EMMA: You wanted to go to college , you had good grades in High School , your father helped you get into Stanford , we 're paying a ton of money , if this is not the reason , then please dear God tell me the eason .
MR. BROOKS: Why does your mother think you dropped out of school ?
JANE: I 'm pregnant . And it 's not the reason I dropped out . Being pregnant would n't stop me from going to school if I wanted to go .
MR. BROOKS: Who 's the father ?
JANE: Some guy I was seeing .
EMMA: Does he know ?
JANE: Yes , he 's a married man and he does n't want to have anything to do with me .
EMMA: Oh , Honey , I 'm so sorry .
JANE: I 'm going to have an abortion anyway , so there is nothing to get upset about . I was n't even going to tell you guys . Mr. Brooks looks directly at his Daughter .
MR. BROOKS: There will be no abortion .
JANE: Daddy , you are not going to tell me what to do . It 's my body and I will do what I want to do with it .
MR. BROOKS: You 're right . I 'm sorry . I said it wrong . I 'm not trying to tell you what to do . I 'm trying to say that a grandchild would be a wonderful gift for your mother and me .
EMMA: Please , Honey , do n't have an abortion .
JANE: Would you really want to have a grandchild , even though I 'm not married ?
MR. BROOKS: Yes . The child is what 's important . We would love it and cherish it completely and help you raise it .
JANE: If it means that much to you , I 'll think about it .
MR. BROOKS: Well , we were right , she was hiding something .
MARSHALL: Pregnant 's not all of it . She 's hiding something bigger . Much igger .
MR. BROOKS: You think so ?
MARSHALL: I know so , and so do you .
TECHNICIAN: It 's not what 's here , it 's what 's not here that 's interesting . There 's not a trace of anything foreign . If I did n't know bette I 'd say these people were killed by a ghost .
CAPTAIN LISTER: The autopsy found a tiny piece of plastic in the female victim 's ain .
TECHNICIAN: We 're checking with the ammunition manufacturers .
DETECTIVE ATWOOD: That 's a dead end , he bags the gun .
TECHNICIAN: I do n't understand .
DETECTIVE ATWOOD: He ziplocks a one gallon plastic freezer bag to his wrist over the gun . Bang . Bang . A little bit of plastic is carried by the first slug , the ejected shells go into the bag and it limits the powde esidue . I hear you were looking for me .
CAPTAIN LISTER: Sigy
DETECTIVE ATWOOD: So far they are Mr. and Miss Normal .
SIGY: If you find anything , call , it might help me . He 's gone .
CAPTAIN LISTER: I received a subpoena from you husband 's lawyer for your work ecords , where you were , date and times for the past two years .
DETECTIVE ATWOOD: That 's blackmail .
CAPTAIN LISTER: Almost three quarters of your cases are current . I ca n't let that information go into open court . So until you settle your divorce , I 'm going to have to put you on a desk .
DETECTIVE ATWOOD: That 's also blackmail .
CAPTAIN LISTER: That 's one of your big problems , Atwood , you do n't know how to ask for help .
DETECTIVE ATWOOD: Do you know what he did to me ?
CAPTAIN LISTER: You ca n't grow old as a woman without having at least one lousy man in your life .
DETECTIVE ATWOOD: I was so stupid . While we were married , while I paid for him to live , the son of a bitch fucked every woman he could get his hands on . He fucked my friends , he even fucked a cousin of mine . Everyone knew but me , and they were laughing at me behind my back . He made me look like an idiot . I was a joke .
CAPTAIN LISTER: And ?
DETECTIVE ATWOOD: And what ?
CAPTAIN LISTER: Get over it .
DETECTIVE ATWOOD: I made him an offer . I 'm not going to give him one red cent more .
CAPTAIN LISTER: I hear what he 's asking for , you could take out of pocket change . Do that and go on with your life .
DETECTIVE ATWOOD: I could n't live with myself if I did .
CAPTAIN LISTER: I 'll spread your work among the other guys and the FBI will be here on thursday they 'll take over this case .
DETECTIVE ATWOOD: Please , these are my cases . Nobody knows them like me . Do n't give them away and do n't give the Thumbprint Killer to the FBI . He 's killed people in twelve other states , let them fuck up those investigations . This one 's mine .
CAPTAIN LISTER: You heard Meeks escaped ?
DETECTIVE ATWOOD: Yeah .
CAPTAIN LISTER: Do you want a detail on you in case he comes after you ?
DETECTIVE ATWOOD: I can take care of myself .
CAPTAIN LISTER: You 're a good cop , Tracy , I do n't want to lose you , but you have to help me if you want me to help you .
DETECTIVE ATWOOD: What is wrong with me ? What is wrong with me ? What is wrong with me ?
DETECTIVE ATWOOD: Did you choose them because of where they lived or how they looked or what jobs they had ? Or did you just pick them because at the instant you saw them , you had decided to kill someone ? The side door was perfect . No one could see you pick the lock . With a key she lets herself in .
DETECTIVE ATWOOD: Once again , how did you know where they were ? Did you check the rooms efore you found them ? She had his semen in her vagina , they had just made love , did you hear them or was there a light on ? She steps into the HALL .
DETECTIVE ATWOOD: That 's better What thrill do you get by killing people ? Is it sexual , is it hate , is it power ? Do you feel remorse ? Probably that part of your brain does n't exist . Do you have emotions of love o affection or joy ? Or have you learned to fake them so you wo n't stand out in a crowd .
MR. SMITH: Oh ! You scared me .
DETECTIVE ATWOOD: I 'm sorry I was about to knock . I 'm Detective Atwood with the Chicago Police .
MR. SMITH: Thank you .
DETECTIVE ATWOOD: Are you a photographer Mr. Baffert ?
MR. SMITH: No eh , it 's kind of a hobby , I just started .
DETECTIVE ATWOOD: I do n't know if you 're aware but there was a murder
MR. SMITH: Oh , yes in the house across the alley
DETECTIVE ATWOOD: Did you happen to see anything unusual or suspicious that night around that house ? Anything at all ?
MR. SMITH: No I wondered that when I heard what happened , but no . I 'm sorry , I 'm meeting someone and I do n't want to be late .
DETECTIVE ATWOOD: Here 's my card , if you hea anything or remember anything .
MR. SMITH: I wish I could be of more help , but sorry .
MR. BROOKS: He looks clean . He looks like he 's alone .
MARSHALL: No , I 'm telling you he wants to do this .
MR. BROOKS: I guess I should turn around and go pick him up .
MARSHALL: Nah . Just honk . Maybe he 'll get killed crossing the street and save us the mess of doing it .
MR. SMITH: Woof ! It 's really coming down out there .
MR. BROOKS: They say it 'll be sunny tomorrow .
MR. SMITH: I never trust those guys , when they say it 's going to be clear it always rains and when they say it 's going to rain , it 's sunny . He comes up with the manila envelope .
MR. BROOKS: The pictures and the memory card all here ?
MR. SMITH: Yeah .
MR. BROOKS: You and I both know that not all the pictures are in here and you made a copy of the Memory Card , is n't that so ?
MR. SMITH: But you understand my position . Mr. Brooks favors him with a wolfish smile .
MR. BROOKS: Yes , I do . But it 's my hope that once you get to know me bette you 'll feel comfortable in giving me all that I 've asked for .
MR. SMITH: That sounds fair . Oh , I almost forgot . I thought you might be interested in this . His hand comes forward with a card .
MARSHALL: Wow ! We 've never known anyone who 's looking for us before .
MR. BROOKS: This is too close , Marshall , too damn close .
MR. SMITH: So , what do we do now ? What 's the plan for the evening ?
MR. BROOKS: We drive around until we see someone we think we might enjoy killing .
MR. SMITH: Really ? That 's it ? I thought you might already have someone in mind .
MR. BROOKS: I do n't enjoy this , Mr. Smith . I do it because I 'm addicted to it . And efore you entered my life I had vowed I would never kill again . So this is your party , you can chose anyone you want and we 'll do it together .
MR. SMITH: Can it be someone I know ?
MR. BROOKS: You never kill someone you know . That 's the easiest way to get caught .
STEWARDESS: I was n't in town that night , my oommate was , maybe he saw something .
DETECTIVE ATWOOD: May I speak to him ?
STEWARDESS: He 's on his way to Tokyo now , he 's also a Flight Attendant .
DETECTIVE ATWOOD: Did the victims ever leave the curtains in the bedroom open ?
STEWARDESS: All the time . I do n't know if they thought we could n't see them `` fucking '' or they did n't care .
DETECTIVE ATWOOD: Here 's my card , could you ask you oommate to call me when he gets ack , the people at that numbe will find me any hour of the day o night .
STEWARDESS: I wo n't be here , but I 'll leave him a note .
MR. BROOKS: I buy one of those locks and I practice on it , same with the alarm some I know how to bypass , some I have to study .
MR. SMITH: You do n't mind me asking these questions ?
MR. BROOKS: No . This is your first time , you 're interested . And you should be if you 're
MR. SMITH: Jesus Christ ! !
MR. SMITH: Fuck him ! ! It was his fault ! ! What an asshole ! !
MARSHALL: Maybe Mr. Smith would like to kill the driver of the pickup .
MR. BROOKS: What about the driver of the pickup ? What if we killed him ?
MR. SMITH: Oh , fuck , yes ! ! I 've always wanted to kill someone who fucked with me in traffic .
MR. BROOKS: Do you want to kill the driver of the pickup or the owner , they may not be the same .
MR. SMITH: The driver .
MR. BROOKS: Okay we 'll follow until we get a look at him , or her ; would it other you to kill a woman ?
MR. SMITH: No . An asshole 's an asshole . Mr. Brooks begins to slow down .
MR. BROOKS: The asshole should n't know we 've decided to follow him , or her .
MALE VOICE: Yes ?
DETECTIVE ATWOOD: It 's Tracy . Can you carve out some time for me tonight ? I 'll be home in an hour and a half . I 'll see you there .
MR. BROOKS: Would you recognize him if you saw his driver 's license picture ?
MR. SMITH: Yeah .
MR. BROOKS: I 've memorized the license number , you write it down . When you get home go on the Internet and find out everything you can about this guy .
MR. SMITH: We are n't going to kill him tonight ?
MR. BROOKS: No . We could , but then we would n't e in control . We could leave loose ends , and we both know the dange of that .
MR. SMITH: I got it .
MR. BROOKS: Look at me . Mr. Smith does .
MR. SMITH: VF eh
MR. BROOKS: Do n't feel bad , I 've been doing this a long time Pen , paper . Write it down .
MR. SMITH: What was your first time ?
MR. BROOKS: You really do n't want to know that much about me , Mr. Smith .
DETECTIVE ATWOOD: Hi .
LARRY: Hi . I brought a dress and a pair of shoes . I thought we could leave from here .
DETECTIVE ATWOOD: Great idea . She lifts herself to him and they kiss .
LARRY: I gave him my driver 's license , my student ID , he did n't look anything like me , luckily they never checked .
DETECTIVE ATWOOD: I did something like that except I was the one who took the test . It was n't math , a friend of mine was a theology major and needed a second language to get into the Master 's program
LARRY: She started her career in theology with a lie ? !
DETECTIVE ATWOOD: Is n't that what all theology is ased on ?
LARRY: Did you pass the test ?
DETECTIVE ATWOOD: Oh yeah
LARRY: Do n't tell me she ended up as Mother Teresa or the Pope .
DETECTIVE ATWOOD: No , she realized very quickly there was n't enough money in religion fo her , the last I heard she 'd written a diet book that was very successful .
LARRY: She stayed in religion .
LARRY: Thank you , this was wonderful .
DETECTIVE ATWOOD: For me too .
LARRY: I 'll see you then ?
DETECTIVE ATWOOD: I 'd like that . The money is in the usual place .
LARRY: It 's not just the money , Tracy . I like you .
DETECTIVE ATWOOD: I like you too , Larry . Send me a ill for the dress and the shoes .
LARRY: I will . Good-night .
DETECTIVE ATWOOD: Good-night .
MR. BROOKS: . Huh her father 's Gerald Atwood , why does that ring a bell ?
MARSHALL: Someone you did business with , someone we killed ?
MR. BROOKS: Not someone we killed MBA College of William and Mary she 's been a cop for eleven years Married Doctor Carlson , divorced Dr. Carlson , married Jesse Vialo restaurateur separated from Jesse Vialo , sued for support y Jesse Vialo , seeing a shrink ecause of Jesse Vialo
MARSHALL: Excellent fitness report though .
MR. BROOKS: She caught the Hangman , the guy that escaped the other day
MARSHALL: Oooh She 's caught a lot of people And look here , this is n't the first time she 's been hunting for us .
MR. BROOKS: I wonder what the deal was with he and Jesse Vialo ?
MR. BROOKS: Ahhhh now I remember . He father , Gerald Atwood , never did usiness with him but Emma and I met him a couple times , big political fundraiser . He owns o owned one of the largest insurance groups in the country and a lot of other stuff .
MARSHALL: Younger , restaurateur She married him on the rebound from the doctor and I 'll bet he married her for her money and he connections .
MR. BROOKS: The old man being rich does n't mean she 's rich . Maybe he 's one of those guys who would rather give it to the Opera than to his kids .
MARSHALL: Would n't she have to declare any outside income and holdings to the Police ?
MR. BROOKS: Hmmm
MARSHALL: Why would a woman with he education and worth 60 plus million dollars and probably more to come , want to be a cop ?
MR. BROOKS: I like that about her .
MARSHALL: You 're such a fucking snob , Earl . You like her because she 's rich .
MR. BROOKS: No , I like her because she found something that 's hers . It 's not the family business . And she 's good at it . I 'd like Jane to find something that 's hers and that she could be good at .
MARSHALL: That 's exactly why Atwood scares the shit out of me . She 's a cop who does n't need the money and she 's looking for us . That 's one fucking dangerous human being .
MR. BROOKS: The fact that you 're not wrong does n't make me admire her any less .
DETECTIVE ATWOOD: Hi She reaches out , the Women shake hands .
ASIAN ATTORNEY: Hi . I got you a Latte .
DETECTIVE ATWOOD: Thanks and thanks for meeting me here .
ASIAN ATTORNEY: We got an injunction to quash the subpoena for your work records yesterday . They 've already appealed .
DETECTIVE ATWOOD: That does n't help me does it ?
ASIAN ATTORNEY: Your father has a lot of political muscle .
DETECTIVE ATWOOD: My father does nothing for nothing .
ASIAN ATTORNEY: I understand . If you 're willing to play the game and ride a desk for a year ; I think we can settle for one two five , one five .
DETECTIVE ATWOOD: No desk .
ASIAN ATTORNEY: Then the only other option is money . Tell me how high you are willing to go .
DETECTIVE ATWOOD: One five .
ASIAN ATTORNEY: I can try . If I were on the othe side I 'd hold out for more .
DETECTIVE ATWOOD: How much more ?
ASIAN ATTORNEY: Give me a cap and that 's how high we 'll go .
DETECTIVE ATWOOD: Try and get a number out of them first . I want to know what ballpark I 'm playing in and if it 's a lump sum , is it less than something that 's paid in installments .
ASIAN ATTORNEY: I 'll call them today . Atwood stands up with her coffee .
DETECTIVE ATWOOD: I 'd like to get this done as soon as possible .
ASIAN ATTORNEY: Are you working on the Thumbprint Killer this time ?
DETECTIVE ATWOOD: Yeah .
ASIAN ATTORNEY: That one 's creepy to me . The doors are locked , the alarms are armed and the people are dead . It makes you feel like you 're not safe anywhere .
DETECTIVE ATWOOD: Where are you parked ?
ASIAN ATTORNEY: I 'm right over there .
DETECTIVE ATWOOD: I 'm down the street . Call me as soon as you have something . She starts to walk away .
ASIAN ATTORNEY: Oh , Tracy I almost forgot , you husband says there 's a picture of him holding some trophy that you still have .
DETECTIVE ATWOOD: He took all those pictures . He took everything .
ASIAN ATTORNEY: He claims it 's his favorite picture and you put it up where you store your suitcases .
DETECTIVE ATWOOD: I 'll look .
ASIAN ATTORNEY: I know it 's petty , but you 're going through a divorce .
MEEKS: Surprise , surprise , Tracy . I told you I was coming back to get you . He frees his right hand and pulls his gun .
MEEKS: I already know where I 'm gon na hang you . But first I 'm gon na watch her have some fun with you , then she 's gon na watch me have some fun with you .
DETECTIVE ATWOOD: SHOOT ME ! ! !
CAPTAIN LISTER: We found the van in an underground lot about two miles from where they left you . It was stolen last night .
SNYDER: These are the women we have pictures of who know Meeks .
CAPTAIN LISTER: Meeks and the Woman , none of the Attendants remember seeing them .
DETECTIVE ATWOOD: That chiropractor , Alvin Griffin , who sold Meeks his steroids , he might know where he is .
CAPTAIN LISTER: His phone 's been tapped since Meeks escaped . No contact that way so fa and he 's sure not going to talk to us .
DETECTIVE ATWOOD: What about a warrant to search his house ? Get me in the door and he 'll talk to me .
CAPTAIN LISTER: How 's your divorce going ?
DETECTIVE ATWOOD: I took your advice and told my lawyer to settle . Stretching out her arm to return the photos
DOCTOR: Whoa I 'm sewing up your head here .
DETECTIVE ATWOOD: Sorry .
CAPTAIN LISTER: And your ego can handle that ?
DETECTIVE ATWOOD: It does n't like any of the othe choices .
CAPTAIN LISTER: Until Meeks is caught , Snyder is with you .
DETECTIVE ATWOOD: Nothing personal , Snyder . He 's not part of our team .
CAPTAIN LISTER: He 's there to protect you . And listen to him , he 's been alive longer than you have .
SNYDER: I did n't volunteer for this , Atwood .
CAPTAIN LISTER: The Parking Lot has a security camera . We 're checking the tape . If Meeks and the Woman left in a ca we 'll have a license number . You have two days then I want a progress report on your divorce .
DETECTIVE ATWOOD: I think I have all the pieces on the Thumbprint Killer , I 'm just not looking at them the right way .
CAPTAIN LISTER: Okay , you have three days . She leaves .
DETECTIVE ATWOOD: Every babysitter I ever had loved me .
MR. SMITH: Maybe he went home with someone else .
MR. BROOKS: Can you still see his pickup ? Mr. Smith looks .
MR. SMITH: Uh huh .
MR. BROOKS: This is not the kind of guy who leaves his pickup in an unguarded Lot overnight . The silence returns .
MARSHALL: You really should pay more attention to what you read , Earl .
MR. BROOKS: That 's what I have you for , Marshall .
MARSHALL: His picture was on the front page of the paper a couple days ago ecause he escaped from jail . He 's the killer they call the Hangman .
MR. BROOKS: Ahh
MARSHALL: Remember that cop you like , Atwood , who 's chasing us , she 's the one who put him away . I think his name is Thorton Meeks .
MR. BROOKS: Well , well , well What would life e without surprises ?
MR. SMITH: There he is !
MR. BROOKS: I do n't think I want to kill this guy .
MR. SMITH: What ? ! But you promised we would ! Marshall smiles .
MARSHALL: Oh , I love what you 're thinking .
MR. BROOKS: You have no idea what I 'm thinking .
MARSHALL: Oh yes I do , and it 's wonderfully twisted .
MR. BROOKS: I know I said we would , but I do n't think it would be that much fun .
MR. SMITH: So just like that , you 're saying 'no ' , it 's not going to happen .
MR. BROOKS: Yes .
MR. SMITH: I see .
MARSHALL: You get the number ?
MR. BROOKS: I got it .
MARSHALL: Mr. Smith wants you to notice he 's pouting .
MR. BROOKS: Yeah , I know .
MR. SMITH: Yeah , I am upset .
MR. BROOKS: Maybe I was a little abrupt back there , but let me explain . Finding someone you think would be fun to kill is a bit like falling in love . You meet a lot of candidates , and you like some of them and they 're nice , but they 're not right ; and then that special one shows up and your heart beats faster and you know that 's the one . The man in the pickup did not make my heart beat faster .
MR. SMITH: Okay , he did not make your heart eat faster . If not him , who ?
MR. BROOKS: I do n't know , I think I have someone in mind .
MR. SMITH: Do you need me to do any work on it ?
MR. BROOKS: No , let 's see how it plays out .
MR. SMITH: You see ? That 's my problem . That makes me feel like I 'm being jerked around , Mr. Brooks . I thought it was happening last night , then it was happening tonight . And now it 's `` Let 's see how it plays out '' .
MR. BROOKS: I promise you , it will happen .
MR. SMITH: When ? That 's what I want to know , Mr. Brooks . When ?
MR. BROOKS: Tomorrow night , same time . When you come out of your building , turn ight , go to the first street you can go west on , I 'll pick you up on that street .
MR. SMITH: Okay .
MR. BROOKS: Do n't you think I want to do this , Mr. Smith ?
MR. SMITH: Maybe you do n't anymore .
MARSHALL: Even if that guy was charming and funny I still would n't like him .
MR. BROOKS: Hi , what can I do for you ? The shorter One holds up a badge .
DETECTIVE 1: I 'm Detective Smolny with the Chicago Police and this is Detective Carfagno , from Palo Alto , California
MR. BROOKS: Jane is my daughter , what 's this about ?
CARFAGNO: There was a murder at Stanford not long before she left . She may be able to help us .
MR. BROOKS: Is she a suspect ?
CARFAGNO: Not at this time . We simply would like to ask her some questions .
MR. BROOKS: Yes she is .
CARFAGNO: The questions wo n't take long .
MR. BROOKS: I 'm sure you would have no objection if she had an attorney present .
SMOLNY: That 's fine . Here 's my card . We can schedule a time for later today or tomorrow for her to come in to see us . Mr. Brooks looks at the card .
MR. BROOKS: If you gentlemen can wait , I will call my lawyer right now and see what we can work out .
SMOLNY: Oh , that 's even better .
MR. BROOKS: Would you like some coffee ?
SMOLNY: Thank you .
MARSHALL: We both knew she was hiding something bigger , I certainly did n't think it was this big .
MR. BROOKS: She 's not a suspect , Marshall . She may not have anything to do with it at all .
MR. BROOKS: Did Jane ever tell you that there was a murder at her school ?
EMMA: No .
MR. BROOKS: Nothing ? Not that a friend died o someone she knew died ? Or someone in her dorm died ?
EMMA: No .
MR. BROOKS: There are two Detectives downstairs , one is from Palo Alto , they want to ask her some questions about a murder that occurred shortly before she came home .
EMMA: Oh , my Gosh ! I 'm sure if she was close to someone who was murdered , she would have said something .
MR. BROOKS: I called Roger , he suggested a criminal attorney , they 'll be here within the hour .
EMMA: I 'll get dressed .
MR. BROOKS: Mr. Clifford , it was a pleasure . Thank you for coming on such short notice .
HEAVYSET LAWYER: There wo n't be any more dropping by like they did today , they 'll call us first .
MR. BROOKS: Thanks again , Roger . It was a good idea to hear what they wanted to know sooner rather than later .
MR. CLIFFORD: We 'll talk .
MR. BROOKS: Yup . He waves and re-enters the house .
MR. BROOKS: You did good , Kid . Your answers were clear , concise and honest . And when they tried to trip you up , it did n't work .
JANE: I hope so . I 'm not feeling so well .
EMMA: Should you lie down ?
JANE: I think I 'd better .
MR. BROOKS: Try and get some sleep . Jane bends her steps toward the stairs .
JANE: I 'm sorry I did n't tell you about it , Daddy . It was horrible but I eally did n't know the guy that well . It happened at about the same time I found out I was pregnant , and it just went out of my mind .
MR. BROOKS: I understand . Jane resumes her journey up the stairs .
MR. BROOKS: God help me . What do I do ?
MARSHALL: She did it , did n't she ?
MR. BROOKS: Yeah . It 'll take the Cops a week to ten days to put their case togethe and then they 'll come back and arrest her .
MARSHALL: What are you going to do ?
MR. BROOKS: I 've been afraid of this since the day she was born . She has what I have .
MARSHALL: Yes , she does . But you 've always een smart about it . She was stupid . She did it because she got off on it , she did it for fun . Why did n't she think it through ? A hatchet ! And she left it there ! !
MR. BROOKS: They were pretty graphic , were n't they ?
MARSHALL: That was to shock her into making a mistake .
MR. BROOKS: What does she think I think ? Does n't she remember what she told me ? That the BMW was being driven across country by a friend and now ight in front of me , she tells the Cops it was stolen .
MARSHALL: You 've always cleaned up after her , whatever she did , all her life .
MR. BROOKS: If the BMW has anything incriminating in it , I hope it was stolen or she dropped it at the ottom of a very deep lake .
MARSHALL: Do you think she knows what kind of trouble she 's in ?
MR. BROOKS: I think she thought she had gotten away with it until the Cops showed up . I should have listened to her , it was there . She was telling me . ' I did n't quit school because I was pregnant ' . I should have dug deeper .
MARSHALL: And where would you be but at the exact same place you are now . It is not your fault , Earl . Part of you problem with her is that you always think it is .
MR. BROOKS: She has what I have , Marshall . So on a very basic level , it is my fault .
MARSHALL: What are you going to do ?
MR. BROOKS: Maybe the best thing for her would e to let her go to jail .
MARSHALL: And what about her child ?
MR. BROOKS: Emma and I would raise it .
MARSHALL: You might be right , Earl , you might e. Because you know if she 's not stopped , she 's going to do it again . And if she wants to take over the box business , the next victim could be you .
MR. BROOKS: I do n't think she 'd go that far .
SIGY: Here and here .
DETECTIVE ATWOOD: What 's that ?
SIGY: A high fire stoneware clay .
SNYDER: Like you make ashtrays and vases from ?
SIGY: This is more plates and teacups . It was slightly wet when whoever it was tracked it into the house and it stuck to the carpet fibers . We 're thinking it was the killer .
DETECTIVE ATWOOD: It could have been tracked in by a friend .
SIGY: That 's the thing , you see , the friend would have had to have been there almost at the same time the killer was . Otherwise the samples would have been dry and the kille would have vacuumed them up .
DETECTIVE ATWOOD: Is the clay rare , is it difficult to get ?
SIGY: You can buy it almost anywhere .
SNYDER: That 's not much help , Sigy .
DETECTIVE ATWOOD: And this is the only incongruity you were able to find in the whole house .
SIGY: We 've done everything we know how to do . It sure does n't break the case wide open , does it ? .
DETECTIVE ATWOOD: No , Sigy , it does n't . It does give me an excuse to ask someone some new questions .
SUNDAY: Yes , Mr. Brooks ?
MARSHALL: Before you open your mouth , be very sure this is the right thing to do .
MR. BROOKS: I will never be sure .
MARSHALL: You get pissed at me because I 'm always the one arguing to go ahead and do murder . Not this time , Earl . This is your decision .
MR. BROOKS: I know it 's wrong . In my heart I know it 's wrong .
MARSHALL: Then do n't do it . Go with Mr. Smith tonight and end that , then let the Police put Jane in jail . Hopefully that will save her and we can happily go on with our tortured lives .
MR. BROOKS: That 's exactly what I want to do . That 's exactly what I should do . The thing is , she 's my daughter and I love her .
SUNDAY: I 'll take care of it .
MR. BROOKS: If you need me , need me , call my studio , that 's where I 'll be .
SUNDAY: I 'll try not to bother you . The door closes behind her .
MARSHALL: The thing that bothers me about this , besides the fact we 're not prepared , and a multitude of othe things , is what does Mr. Smith do when he 's walking west tonight and you do n't show up . That little freak could flip out .
MR. BROOKS: I 'll take care of it on the way to the airport .
MR. BROOKS: - night - Do n't - be - stupid - .
MR. SMITH: Fuck you ! He inserts the key into the ignition .
DETECTIVE ATWOOD: You remember me ? All Mr. Smith can do is nod .
MR. SMITH: What do you mean ? I do n't have anything to tell you .
DETECTIVE ATWOOD: Really ? Because I was driving around and I got this sudden feeling that you had something to tell me about the murders .
MR. SMITH: No . Nothing .
DETECTIVE ATWOOD: That 's disappointing . Because when I left you the last time we talked , I felt I had missed a clue that was ight in front of me that would solve this whole case .
MR. SMITH: I do n't know why you would feel that .
DETECTIVE ATWOOD: Did n't you tell me you were an amateur potter , that you made bowls and vases ?
MR. SMITH: No , I said I was an amateu photographer .
DETECTIVE ATWOOD: Are you positive ? Because we found potter 's clay on the carpet of the murder house and I was sure you said to me that you worked with clay , that you made pots .
MR. SMITH: No . I said my hobby was photography , not pottery .
DETECTIVE ATWOOD: Maybe that was it . The Stewardess upstairs said the victims kept their curtains open when they made love . Could I see some of the pictures you took of that Couple ?
MR. SMITH: You are harassing me , Detective Atwood . You know very well I 'm not a potter and I do n't have any pictures ! So my feeling is that your feeling is wrong and that you should move your car and let me go home .
DETECTIVE ATWOOD: What is your job here ? What do you do ?
MR. SMITH: I 'm a mechanical engineer .
DETECTIVE ATWOOD: You have to be pretty smart fo that , do n't you ?
MR. SMITH: I guess .
DETECTIVE ATWOOD: Then be smart , Mr. Baffert . You lied to me right there at the end . I 'll be watching you . And when you want to tell me the truth , you know how to get in touch with me . She gives him a dazzling smile .
SNYDER: Captain Lister got us the search warrant for Meeks ' Chiropractor .
DETECTIVE ATWOOD: Good . Goddamit ! , that guy knows something He almost told me and then something happened .
SNYDER: You think he did it ?
DETECTIVE ATWOOD: I do n't think it 's that simple .
STEWARDESS: Here you are , Sir .
MR. BROOKS: Thank you .
UNIFORMED POLICEMAN: We have a warrant to search you home and premises . We 're coming in .
DETECTIVE ATWOOD: Lights do n't work .
DETECTIVE ATWOOD: We have a dead woman in here .
SNYDER: Hey ! He squints and turns away .
DETECTIVE ATWOOD: I thought you were behind me .
SNYDER: The living room is clean .
DETECTIVE ATWOOD: Snyder , meet Mona .
UNIFORMED POLICEMAN: I called it in .
DETECTIVE ATWOOD: Do that outside . The Officer does n't have to be told twice .
SNYDER: I thought Meeks hung people . Atwood retraces her steps in the Kitchen .
DETECTIVE ATWOOD: Meeks is a steroid freak . This Refrigerator was always full of steroids . Mona was Alvin Griffin 's niece , receptionist , lover and keeper of the keys .
SNYDER: You think Meeks has Alvin with him ?
DETECTIVE ATWOOD: Meeks thinks Alvin turned him in . She shuts the Refrigerator .
DETECTIVE ATWOOD: Snyder , this is Alvin Griffin .
MARSHALL: How do you feel ?
MR. BROOKS: Dirty .
MARSHALL: That 's understandable . You 've neve killed for this reason before . The feeling will go away .
MR. BROOKS: I do n't think so . It 's the whole thing , Marshall . If I could find a way to just disappear , where there was absolutely no trace of me ; ecause eventually I will get caught doing this . And it 'll be very embarrassing for me and Emma and Jane . So I 've been thinking is there a way that Mr. Smith could kill me and make me disappear .
MARSHALL: Number one , Mr. Smith is not smart enough to do that . Number two , there is no reason , if you 're careful , to believe you will eve get caught .
MR. BROOKS: I know I will have to plan it fo Mr. Smith , but I think that 's what I want to do .
MARSHALL: I 'm not particularly fond of that plan , Earl . Remember if you die , I go with you and I like being alive . I like eating , I like fucking , I like killing .
MR. BROOKS: I have to end it , Marshall . One way or the other . And I think this is the best way .
MARSHALL: Well fuck you then .
EMMA: You worked all night .
MR. BROOKS: I had ideas for pots that took too long and the clay kept winning I 'll be fine .
DETECTIVE ATWOOD: Yes ?
ASIAN ATTORNEY: Hi Tracy , this is Nancy Tang . We eceived a counter offer . Are you sitting down ?
DETECTIVE ATWOOD: Yeah , go ahead He ca n't get that , can he ? ! INTERCUT with Nancy .
DETECTIVE ATWOOD: Never . How long can you stall them ?
NANCY: They know you want this done quickly , so they 're going to expect a quick counter offer .
DETECTIVE ATWOOD: I need two days . Wait two days efore getting back to them . If they call , tell them it 's a big number , I 'm thinking about it .
NANCY: Okay .
DETECTIVE ATWOOD: And the picture he wanted
EMMA: Earl Earl Mr. Brooks opens his eyes .
MR. BROOKS: Huh ?
EMMA: Roger is on the phone .
JANE: Oh , Hi , Daddy , I thought you 'd already be gone .
MR. BROOKS: Roger called . There was anothe murder last night near Stanford .
JANE: Oh
MR. BROOKS: Done the same way as the one they talked to you about . Right down to the hatchet being left at the scene .
JANE: That 's good news , is n't it ? I mean even if you 're innocent it 's good news to know you 're not a suspect .
MR. BROOKS: Oh , yeah . How 's the morning sickness ? Do you want to ride in with me today ?
JANE: I feel fine , but I do n't know how long that will last .
MR. BROOKS: Do you love me , Jane ?
JANE: Of course I love you , daddy , you 're my father .
MR. BROOKS: Have you decided whether or not to keep the baby ?
JANE: Not yet .
MR. BROOKS: Okay .
SNYDER: What are we doing ?
DETECTIVE ATWOOD: 'Are we there yet ? ' , are we there yet ? ' , you sound like a child . We 're playing a hunch .
SNYDER: We 've been following this guy all day , he 's boring , and everything we un on him comes up clean .
DETECTIVE ATWOOD: If it did n't , it would n't be called a hunch .
SNYDER: Meeks ' finger-prints were all ove the chiropractor , the note , efrigerator , he 's the guy we should be looking for .
DETECTIVE ATWOOD: Look where ? Please tell me . Everyone knows who Meeks is and is looking for him . The chiropracto was the last link to his old life that I know of . The only way we 'll find him , now , is if someone turns him in or we trip over him at a bus stop . On the other hand , Detective Snyder , no one knows who the Thumbprint Killer is or where he is . However , I have a fucking hunch this guy Baffert does . I have two days to play that hunch . If you feel like you 're wasting your time with me , I 'd be happy to do it alone . He looks at her and shakes his head .
SNYDER: I had a fight with my wife this morning ; what 's your problem ?
DETECTIVE ATWOOD: My husband wants five million dollars .
SNYDER: Lister is pulling you off this case .
DETECTIVE ATWOOD: Why ? !
SNYDER: Maybe they caught him .
DETECTIVE ATWOOD: No . She would have said that .
SNYDER: You want to keep following him ? Atwood hesitates .
DETECTIVE ATWOOD: Good thinking , Tonto .
SECRETARY: She 's with someone .
DETECTIVE ATWOOD: Good .
DETECTIVE ATWOOD: You promised if I settled my divorce I had three days on the Thumbprint Killer . I have the rest of today and tomorrow left .
CAPTAIN LISTER: Detective Atwood , meet FBI Agents Longnecker and Campbell , they 're taking over your investigation .
DETECTIVE ATWOOD: You promised you would keep them out of it for three days .
CAPTAIN LISTER: They wo n't allow me to keep that promise . Atwood glares at her then at the FBI Men .
DETECTIVE ATWOOD: This is my case , what you 're doing is fucked . But since I ca n't stop you , and she wo n't , here 's a tip . James Baffert , you should stake him out , he knows something .
DETECTIVE LONGNECKER: We have some other ideas we are looking into .
DETECTIVE ATWOOD: Then what 's the problem ? You do that and I 'll tail Baffert .
DETECTIVE LONGNECKER: Thank you for all your good work , Detective . This is our case now . Atwood looks from one Man to the Other .
DETECTIVE ATWOOD: Good luck . Later I suppose you 'll fill me in on what I 'm supposed to be doing around here . I 'm confused .
MARSHALL: It 's time to go .
MR. BROOKS: Yeah .
MARSHALL: Dear Emma and Jane , my loves , I have a terminal illness and instead of subjecting you to my deterioration , I have decided to disappear . Do n't try to find me , I do n't want to be found . Please elieve that the time I spent with you brought me the greatest joy of my life . Love . Dad . Mr. Brooks picks up the letter and folds it .
MR. BROOKS: It 's all planned to work out , Marshall . On the envelope he writes For EMMA and JANE .
MARSHALL: I smell gun oil , a gun oil that 's different than yours .
MR. BROOKS: He brought his gun . After he gets what he wants he plans to kill me .
MARSHALL: Ah now I get it . You were counting on that , were n't you ?
MR. BROOKS: It has a certain logic .
MARSHALL: But if your plan is to have him kill you , why do you have to kill someone else first ?
MR. BROOKS: He 'll need to see that to get up the courage to kill me . Marshall roars with laughter .
MARSHALL: Not even you believe that , Earl . It makes it more exciting , does n't it , to think he 's going to kill you after you kill someone else . You 're getting your rocks off big time , that 's why you 're doing it .
MR. BROOKS: Not true and if it were , so what ? You 're goddamn great , you know . To have the balls to do this .
MR. SMITH: I 'm pretty nervous but that 's normal right ?
MR. BROOKS: Perfectly normal .
DETECTIVE ATWOOD: Hello Oh , yes , yes . Put him through Hi , this is Detective Atwood speaking , thanks for callingYes , your roommate said you were in Tokyo Anything , if you saw anything at all it might e helpful .
FLIGHT ATTENDANT: The weird thing is that they closed their curtains , at first they were open like they always were and they were making love , which they always did , and then when I looked again the curtains were closed , and there were what looked like camera flashes coming from behind the curtains . INTERCUT with Detective Atwood .
DETECTIVE ATWOOD: Camera flashes ?
FLIGHT ATTENDANT: That 's what it looked like .
DETECTIVE ATWOOD: That 's why he poses them .
FLIGHT ATTENDANT: I 'm sorry ?
DETECTIVE ATWOOD: Nothing .
FLIGHT ATTENDANT: I wish I could be more helpful , I did n't see the killer or anything like that , but since it was weird I thought I should call .
DETECTIVE ATWOOD: You 've been very helpful . This answers a lot of questions for me . Thank you very much , Mr. Struber .
FLIGHT ATTENDANT: The guy you should talk to is the guy on the floor below us
DETECTIVE ATWOOD: Would that be , Mr. Baffert ?
FLIGHT ATTENDANT: Yeah , I think Jim or James
DETECTIVE ATWOOD: Thank you very much . Atwood disconnects then quickly dials .
MR. BROOKS: Put these on .
MR. SMITH: I have to take a crap so bad .
MR. BROOKS: This wo n't take long .
SHEILA: I called your wife 's lawyer . They 're thinking about the five million dollars .
JESSE: Realistically how much do you think we can get ?
SHEILA: If we go to court , best case , two , if she wants to settle , best case , three , but I would be happy with two seven .
JESSE: I 'll be right back . On his way out of the LIVING ROOM
SHEILA: Let 's not be piggish , two five , two seven , would be a good deal .
JESSE: You 're late ; if we want it , there 's more . They clink glasses .
SHEILA: To us .
JESSE: To three million dollars .
SHEILA: We have to do this fast because emember , Marie is meeting us here .
JESSE: We could ask her to join us .
SHEILA: Not funny .
JESSE: I was n't trying to be .
SHEILA: Are we alone ?
JESSE: Yeah .
MR. BROOKS: Do n't do that .
DETECTIVE ATWOOD: Mr. Baffert ? Mr. Baffert ?
OLDER WOMAN: He 's gone .
DETECTIVE ATWOOD: Do you have any idea when he 'll be ack ?
OLDER WOMAN: He skipped out . I heard him leave this evening and a few minutes later there were Movers here . Musta een behind on the rent . He did n't even say good-bye .
DETECTIVE ATWOOD: Thank you .
OLDER WOMAN: I told you .
MAN: Obviously Baffert 's gone
DETECTIVE ATWOOD: Goddamit , Snyder . Knock .
SNYDER: I was n't able to get the search warrant .
DETECTIVE ATWOOD: We may have gotten lucky . This is the Moving Company 's work order and ) it looks like this is the address where they 're taking Baffert 's stuff .
SNYDER: Where were you when you called me ?
DETECTIVE ATWOOD: At home in bed .
SNYDER: Can you prove that ?
DETECTIVE ATWOOD: I was home in bed , why should I have to prove that ?
SNYDER: Your husband Jesse and his lawye were killed tonight
DETECTIVE ATWOOD: Why , I did n't want Jesse dead , I loved him , I hated what he was doing to me
SNYDER: It 's on record you said you 'd like him dead and who better to fake a Thumbprint killing than you .
DETECTIVE ATWOOD: You ca n't actually believe I would do that .
SNYDER: If our jobs have taught us anything , Tracy , is that people do strange things . They just want to ask you some questions .
DETECTIVE ATWOOD: I will be happy to answer any questions after we check out this address .
SNYDER: I have to take you in , Tracy .
DETECTIVE ATWOOD: This is the answer to the Thumbprint Killer , Snyder , and this is where I 'm going and you 're not going to stop me .
SNYDER: Do n't make me cuff you , Tracy , ecause I will if I have to . Atwood smiles winningly .
DETECTIVE ATWOOD: I believe you would .
SNYDER: You can count on it .
DETECTIVE ATWOOD: It would be nice if you could come with me , but if you do and it goes ad , they 'll burn your ass . So this never happened .
MR. SMITH: That was great ! It was fantastic ! It was everything I hoped it would e. Thank you .
MR. BROOKS: You 're welcome . In the back seat
MARSHALL: Here comes the gun . Without taking his eyes off the road .
MR. BROOKS: Yup .
MR. SMITH: You 're smart enough to figure that out , Mr. Brooks .
MR. BROOKS: Well we 're going sixty five miles an hour , Mr. Smith , if you shoot me now , there 's a good chance we 'll oth die .
MR. SMITH: Not now . Take the next off ramp .
MR. BROOKS: That would n't be very smart of me would it ?
MR. SMITH: No . I still have pictures of you doing the first murder .
MR. BROOKS: Yes . But what were you doing at the second murder ? Mr. Smith does n't have an answer for that .
MR. SMITH: How do I do that ?
MR. BROOKS: There 's a cemetery I know about . We find an open grave , you shoot me , I fall in the grave , you shovel in just enough earth to cover me , tomorrow a casket is lowered onto me and I 've disappeared . It 's a good plan . What do you say ?
MR. SMITH: Why should I trust you ?
MR. BROOKS: You do n't have to trust me . You 're the man holding the gun , you saw me put mine in the trunk .
MR. SMITH: I do n't know . You really want me to kill you ?
MR. BROOKS: Yes .
MR. SMITH: Okay But any sudden moves and you 're dead on the spot and I 'll make sure your family knows what you are .
MR. BROOKS: I understand .
DETECTIVE ATWOOD: You 've come down in the world , Mr. Baffert .
MR. SMITH: Uh uh , take your hand out real slow .
MR. BROOKS: It 's locked . You do n't want to climb over , do you ?
MR. SMITH: What are you doing with a key to a cemetery ?
MR. BROOKS: I own it .
MR. SMITH: Why do you own a cemetery ?
MR. BROOKS: You always want to invest in things people ca n't do without . Water and cemeteries are pretty safe .
MR. BROOKS: You 'll need this to get out . Now there should be an open grave around here somewhere . Let 's see if we can find it .
DETECTIVE ATWOOD: Meeks ? ! !
MEEKS: Atwood ?
DETECTIVE ATWOOD: Yeah .
MEEKS: Come on down , there 's something I want to show you .
MR. BROOKS: There we are . Now if I stand here He positions himself at one end of the Grave .
MR. SMITH: You do n't think I have the guts to do this do you ?
MR. BROOKS: I 'm hoping you do .
MR. BROOKS: Unfortunately for you , my daughte is pregnant and just before you pulled the trigger , I realized how much I want to see the end to that story .
MR. SMITH: If you do anything to me , if you touch one hair on my head , the Police will find the pictures of you killing that Couple .
MR. BROOKS: The contents of your safety deposit ox , Mr. Smith , have vanished .
MARSHALL: It says here the Thumbprint Kille is a monster annoys you a little it that you ca n't take credit , does n't it ?
MR. BROOKS: Anyone who is good at what they do , wants recognition . But since I 'm not going to do it anymore , I 'll let Mr. Smith take the credit .
MARSHALL: Do n't kid yourself , Earl , you 're going to kill again .
MR. BROOKS: No , I 'm not . I 'll continue the AA meetings and I 'll control it .
OFFICER: Good work , Atwood .
DETECTIVE ATWOOD: Thanks , Tom . He moves on . From off screen
ANOTHER OFFICER: You should ask the FBI to kiss you ass and buy you a Cadillac .
DETECTIVE ATWOOD: I like my ass too much for that .
SNYDER: This is bogus . The company does n't exist in the city , the state , the United States or Canada .
DETECTIVE ATWOOD: So the whole point of this piece of paper was to give me Meeks .
SNYDER: That 's what it looks like .
DETECTIVE ATWOOD: Why ? Who moved him , where did they move him to , and why did he give me Meeks ?
SNYDER: That 's what we get paid to find out . Atwood picks up the Newspaper .
DETECTIVE ATWOOD: I 'm going to go to the bathroom and think about this . She stands . The phone rings . She answers it .
DETECTIVE ATWOOD: Detective Atwood
MR. BROOKS: Why are you a cop ? INTERCUT with Atwood .
DETECTIVE ATWOOD: Who is this ?
MR. BROOKS: You 're rich , you have a good education , you could have gone into your father 's business , instead you went outside all of that and became successful on your own . Why ?
DETECTIVE ATWOOD: You want something from me if you do n't tell me who you are I 'm going to hang up .
MR. BROOKS: Did you think your husband 's killing was random and I certainly did n't have to give you Meeks .
DETECTIVE ATWOOD: Mr . Baffert ? !
MR. BROOKS: What 's the answer ?
DETECTIVE ATWOOD: You do n't sound like you .
MR. BROOKS: I have a little cold . Are you going to give me the answer ?
DETECTIVE ATWOOD: Where are you ?
MR. BROOKS: I 'll tell you if you can give me the true answer to my question .
DETECTIVE ATWOOD: My father was very disappointed I was born a girl and he let me know that . I 've spent my whole life trying to prove him wrong .
MR. BROOKS: Thank you .
DETECTIVE ATWOOD: Wait . You promised to tell me where you are .
MR. BROOKS: Me ? I 'm on top of a building .
DETECTIVE ATWOOD: Why would he be interested in that ?
MR. BROOKS: Agghhh ! ! ! Agghhh ! ! !
EMMA: Wake up , wake up On the pillow Mr. Brooks ' eyes fly open .
MR. BROOKS: Oh I woke you up .
EMMA: It 's okay . She kisses him on the forehead .
MR. BROOKS: that I may be reasonably happy in this life , And supremely happy with Him forever in the next . Amen . . God grant me the Serenity to accept
THE END: < /pre
BROWN: God save the Queen ! ! And fires .
ASSISTANT DRESSER: Sorry , ma'am .
JENNER: Congratulations , Your Royal Highness !
BERTIE: Thank you , Doctor .
JENNER: A boy , I hear . Excellent , excellent .
BERTIE: Yes . Albert Victor . Eddie for short . What do you think ?
PONSONBY: A fine choice , sir .
JENNER: Excellent !
DRIVER: Are you riding up front ?
BROWN: I 'll stay with the pony , thank you . She 's all the way from Deeside and she 's not sure she likes you yet .
VICTORIA: How many ? LADY ELY is slightly taken aback .
LADY ELY: The Royal Family and senior members of the household , ma'am .
VICTORIA: Just them ?
LADY ELY: Yes , ma'am .
JENNER: We 're expecting Brown this afternoon , ma'am .
VICTORIA: Whom ?
PRINCESS ALEXANDRA: Yes , ma'am .
BROWN: I was due at a quarter past one . You 're late .
PONSONBY: Her Majesty 's routine at Osborne House is not as you will remember it . The Household remains in full mourning and no-one is permitted to raise thei voice under any circumstances whatsoever . As for the Queen 's outine , she breakfasts at nine thirty , lunches at two , takes tea at five thirty and dinner at eight forty five . No one is allowed to leave the uilding while the Queen is at home . On the rare occasions when she is out , you may ask permission to leave , but only with my consent . You 're to be ready to walk the pony at any time after ten o'clock . You 'll clean her outdoor things and do any odd jobs as and when she requires .
BROWN: How will I know ?
PONSONBY: I 'm sorry ?
BROWN: How will I know what she requires ?
PONSONBY: You 'll be sent a message .
BROWN: Who 'll bring it to me ?
PONSONBY: Her Highness ' Equerry .
BROWN: I need a man who knows where I am .
PONSONBY: I 'm sure it wo n't be difficult to find you .
BROWN: That 's not good enough . A beat .
PONSONBY: Then we 'll have to see what can be arranged .
BROWN: Aye , do . PONSONBY stiffens . A beat .
PONSONBY: There is to be no communication with other members of the household on matters concerning the court except through myself or one of the Equerries . No plans must be altered unless you are given prior authority y myself or a senior member of the household .
BROWN: I came down at the Queen 's request . I 'll take my orders from her .
PONSONBY: In matters concerning the Household , I act on her behalf . BROWN takes the measure of him .
BROWN: Do you ?
PONSONBY: Yes . I do . BROWN glances up the corridor .
BROWN: So , is passing wind out of the question or do I need permission fo that ?
PONSONBY: As I am sure you remember from Balmoral , you do not talk while in He Majesty 's presence unless Her Majesty addresses you directly .
VICTORIA: Mr Brown .
BROWN: Ma'am .
VICTORIA: You are here safely .
BROWN: Aye , ma'am .
VICTORIA: You are well ?
BROWN: I am .
VICTORIA: And the pony ?
BROWN: She 's well , too .
VICTORIA: Your family sent cards . It was much appreciated .
BROWN: I 'm glad of it .
VICTORIA: My husband was always very complimentary in speaking of you . He would have approved , I am sure , of my calling on you in this way . I trust it does not inconvenience you too much .
BROWN: I 've no family , ma'am , apart from my others and sisters .
VICTORIA: Yes . You have a brother in service here , do you not ? I forget his name .
BROWN: Archie .
VICTORIA: Yes . That will be company for you .
BROWN: Yes , ma'am .
VICTORIA: You do not - he get him out . Get him out . Get him out !
ARCHIE: So the day they arrive , she greets the Sultan and his family with barely a word and then retires to her chamber . The Sultan , not used to State Occasions without a head of State , is standing in the lobby waiting fo someone to tell him what to do . But the court is under strict instructions not to talk in the corridors so nobody speaks to him , not a living soul , fo the whole afternoon . So now it 's dinner and everyone 's standing round the table still not a word waiting for Her Majesty to arrive . One hour goes by , two , the Sultan 's getting a wee bit peckish to say the least . So finally , his wee laddy eaks for the cold meats and stuffs a slice in his mouth . Well , the uproa when she heard . You 'd have thought someone had stolen the crown jewels . BROWN stares back , still pissed off .
BROWN: So ?
ARCHIE: So , there are rules . Things you do and things you do n't do .
BROWN: I was just telling the woman how I feel , for God 's sake .
ARCHIE: You do n't tell Her Majesty how you feel .
BROWN: I speak as I find , Archie .
ARCHIE: Not down south you do n't .
BROWN: I think he nearly ruptured his truss . A beat , then both men burst out laughing .
ARCHIE: Seventy a year .
BROWN: Not bad , not bad .
ARCHIE: How about yourself ?
BROWN: Sixty .
ARCHIE: That 's pretty good for a ghillie .
BROWN: Prince Leopold ? Is he the one who leeds all day ? So what does his valet do ? Wash his poultices for him ?
ARCHIE: It 's better than shovelling horse shit .
BROWN: If you were looking for promotion , you should have picked one of the healthier ones .
ARCHIE: She 's hardly a full hamper herself .
BROWN: It 's only grief makes her like she is .
ARCHIE: Three years , John . Is that not a bit long to be grieving ?
BROWN: She loved him .
ARCHIE: Come on , man . There 's love and there 's
BROWN: What ?
ARCHIE: You know what I mean .
BROWN: I 'm not sure I do , Archie .
ARCHIE: There 's love and there 's behaving like you do because there 's nobody to tell you not to .
BROWN: Which one of us is she flirting with ?
ARCHIE: The good-looking one .
BROWN: Aye ? Then she 's obviously not got enough to do .
ARCHIE: You work the system right , you could ask her yourself . Just be thankful you 're not working for Household . The Queen never lets them out of he sight . But wee spats like us can slip through the net , easy . A beat . BROWN stares straight at him .
BROWN: I 'm no wee spat , ARCHIE .
VICTORIA: Who is that ? Lady Ely peers through the rain .
LADY ELY: It 's Mr Brown , ma'am .
VICTORIA: What is he doing there ?
LADY ELY: He appears to be standing by his horse .
VICTORIA: I made no request to go out riding today . How long has he been there ?
LADY ELY: I do n't know , ma'am . He was observed earlier , I believe .
VICTORIA: Sir Henry , Mr Brown is standing in the courtyard . I have no wish to go iding .
PONSONBY: I 'm very sorry , ma'am . I ca n't imagine he was certainly given no instructions .
VICTORIA: Please make sure it does not happen again .
PONSONBY: Of course , at once . VICTORIA takes one last look and walks away .
BROWN: Awaiting my orders .
PONSONBY: You do not report for duty unless the Queen requests it . You know that very well .
BROWN: I did n't come all this way to sit on my arse .
PONSONBY: You will await your orders like everyone else . Unless you prefer a epeat of yesterday 's little excitement .
BROWN: No .
PONSONBY: I beg your pardon ?
BROWN: Well , you tell Her Majesty from me , if her husband was here now , he 'd have had her out of that house and getting some air in her . What the hell 's the point in me being here otherwise ? !
PONSONBY: Go inside at once .
BROWN: Is that the Queen 's request ?
PONSONBY: Yes , it most certainly is !
VICTORIA: Mr Brown .
BROWN: Yes , ma'am .
VICTORIA: You have been told repeatedly not to stand in the courtyard unless equested to do so .
BROWN: Yes , ma'am .
VICTORIA: Then why do you persist in doing it ?
BROWN: Because I think Her Majesty is wrong . If ever there was a poor soul who needed fresh air , it is her . A beat .
VICTORIA: The Queen will ride out if and when she chooses .
BROWN: And I intend to be there when she 's eady .
VICTORIA: Prince Albert was going to build a ench here . He thought it one of the est views in Osborne .
BROWN: It 's a fine spot , ma'am .
VICTORIA: He thought so , yes . She stares ahead .
BROWN: If Prince Albert were here today , he 'd tell him a thing or two .
VICTORIA: Sir Henry is not alone . They all wish it . The same people who refused to grant my husband the title of King because he was deemed of insufficient rank
BROWN: Aye , ma'am .
VICTORIA: Yes . A pause .
BERTIE'S VALET: Mr. Carter , the Head Butler , sits there .
BROWN: Not now he does n't . This is my place .
BERTIE'S VALET: By whose authority ?
BROWN: My own .
BERTIE'S VALET: The order of seating at the Uppe Servant 's table is arranged personally y the Queen herself .
BROWN: That 's a tautology lad . If you say the Queen arranges something , you 've no need to say she 's done it personally . That 's understood .
ASSISTANT DRESSER: Assistant , sir , yes .
BROWN: What 's your name ?
ASSISTANT DRESSER: Mary Taylor , sir .
BROWN: Have I seen you up in Balmoral , Mary ?
ASSISTANT DRESSER: I hope to go up next year .
BROWN: You would n't happen to know what the Queen 's reading for recreation , would you , Mary ? The assistant dresser thinks for a moment .
ASSISTANT DRESSER: Lord Tennyson , sir ?
BROWN: Am I the only one eating ?
PONSONBY: Lord Clarendon arrives , by invitation , at eleven o'clock , followed at twelve y a picnic in the grounds to celebrate Princess Alice 's birthday . Dispatches , as usual , at two . The Chancellor writes to say that , by happy coincidence , he will be in Cowes for the weekend . He asks if You Majesty might grant him an audience .
VICTORIA: Why ?
PONSONBY: He thought , perhaps , Your Majesty might wish to be informed of the latest developments in government .
VICTORIA: No . I shall be out walking .
PONSONBY: Then perhaps Your Majesty might consider it opportune if the Prince of Wales were to meet him on your behalf ?
VICTORIA: On no account .
BERTIE: Mama , I really do think it 's time we made ourselves a little more available . VICTORIA carries on knitting .
VICTORIA: Gesture ?
BERTIE: I thought , a dinner for ou ambassadors perhaps ?
VICTORIA: No dinners , Bertie . Why are you dressed for outdoors ?
BERTIE: It 's so infernally cold in here .
VICTORIA: Cold is good Is that not so , Dr . Jenner ? !
JENNER: I 'm sorry , ma'am ?
VICTORIA: Cold is good !
JENNER: Excellent , ma'am , excellent . But perhaps if her Majesty were to consider accompanying her new-found physical vigor with the benefits of mental activity
VICTORIA: Why am I being lectured in this way ? !
JENNER: Forgive me , Your Majesty . In no way did I wish to suggest
VICTORIA: I will not tolerate anybody lecturing me about the responsibility of the monarchy .
BERTIE: Mother .
VICTORIA: Least of all my son . It was his irresponsibility that drove my husband to his grave .
BERTIE: If it is inconvenient to Her Majesty , then perhaps she might conside allowing the Prince of Wales to host
VICTORIA: I do believe they send so many boxes to taunt me . Doctor Jenner writes to them to say that my nerves are in an extremely fragile state and yet they continue to hound me with box after box after box after box after box !
BROWN: You could buy that lot for garden ornaments and still see change from ten guineas .
STANLEY: Have you seen this ?
DISRAELI: The cartoon or Her Majesty 's absenteeism ?
STANLEY: Well , both .
DISRAELI: The question is , do we need her ?
STANLEY: Surely , you 're not suggesting we dispense
DISRAELI: My dear Stanley , a Prime Minister with only a handful of friends must respect public opinion . The pass GLADSTONE in a huddle of cohorts .
STANLEY: So ?
DISRAELI: We 'll see which way the wind blows .
BROWN: My heart 's in the Highlands , my heart is not here ! My heart 's in the Highlands a-chasing the deer ! Chasing the wild deer and following the roe ! My heart 's in the Highlands wherever I go !
ARCHIE: So ? Someone 'll send it on ahead .
BROWN: Aye , but will they ?
ARCHIE: John , it 's not your problem what she eats .
BROWN: The woman 's surrounded by fools ! She has to be packed and ready to leave by seven thirty tomorrow morning . Knowing that lot , they 'll still be dressing her at eight .
ARCHIE: She 's got an army of people to get he up and out .
BROWN: But I 'm the only one she trusts . ARCHIE stares at him . A beat .
ARCHIE: She 'll blow hot and cold on you , John , she always does . You want to be careful .
BROWN: I 'm on ninety pounds a year plus seventy pounds for a pile of tartan I 'd be wearing anyway . That 's as much as a Page of the Back Stairs gets and that job 's only for toffs . I 'm Her Majesty 's Highland Servant ! Indoors and Out . There 's no stopping me now .
PONSONBY: Oh God , not the pipes !
VICTORIA: What are those ?
BROWN: What ?
VICTORIA: Those , over there , there .
BROWN: Craobhan-geanmchno-fhiadhaich .
VICTORIA: Craobhan-geanmchno How can I possibly say that with a straight face ? ! BROWN lets it go and they ride on .
BROWN: Are they worth reading ?
VICTORIA: I am told so .
BROWN: Who by ?
VICTORIA: Sir Henry Ponsonby tells me they are charming .
BROWN: What does he know about the Highlands ?
VICTORIA: He has been attending at Balmoral fo many years .
BROWN: That does n't make him an expert .
VICTORIA: His remarks were directed at the quality of the writing , not its subject .
BROWN: I do n't groom a horse to have it admired by others , I groom it because it needs grooming .
VICTORIA: I do not do it for others . But Ponsonby thinks they are good .
BROWN: Just say what you have to say , woman . What other people think should n't matter to you .
VICTORIA: Of course I shall say what I have to say . I always do .
BROWN: Aye , well , if all you want is a good opinion then he 'd be sure to oblige you .
VICTORIA: What Mr Ponsonby was appreciating was their literary merit , a skill not intimately associated with the knowledge of grooming . Literary appreciation does not begin and end with Tennyson . BROWN lowers his head .
BROWN: She 'll be away on Friday between eight o'clock and six in the evening to visit the Grants in Glasalt . If she 's to make the journey there and back in the day she 's to have no distractions the night before . She 'll take a light supper alone in her private drawing oom and retire early .
PONSONBY: She 'll need to sign dispatches before she retires .
BROWN: That can wait till the weekend .
PONSONBY: There are important papers from
BROWN: It can wait . Anything else ?
JENNER: Are you sure Her Majesty is up to such a long journey ? She has only just ecovered from a severe head cold .
BROWN: If I thought she was n't up to it , I would n't let her go , would I ?
BERTIE: Surely it is for the gentlemen to decide when to stop
VICTORIA: It is a disgusting habit , Bertie . It should be discouraged .
BERTIE: Yes , but is n't midnight a little excessive ?
VICTORIA: It is quite late enough .
BERTIE: But mama , the room was built expressly for that purpose . It has been a smoking-room by tradition ever since father
VICTORIA: Brown 's responsibilities are onerous enough already . He has far too much to do without having to stay up all night waiting for you to go to bed . The smoking-room will be closed and the lights put out at twelve o'clock .
BERTIE: Mama
VICTORIA: And that is my last word on the matter .
BERTIE: Well , I 'm sorry , but I really do think it 's too much that the gentlemen of the house should be dictated to by a servant .
BROWN: It 's the Queen 's decision .
BERTIE: I beg your pardon ? Mama ?
BROWN: I think you should go now . You 've tired your mother enough .
MRS GRANT: I 'll not have her seeing it like it is ! I know she means well , but I wish she 'd warn us she was coming .
BROWN: She thinks if she warned you , you 'd go pouring water on the fire and stuffing the knitting under the sofa .
MR GRANT: Aye , well , you ca n't stop a wife being house-proud . MRS GRANT surveys the room critically .
MRS GRANT: All right . Show her in .
BROWN: They 're ready now .
VICTORIA: I hope they did n't go to any trouble , John .
BROWN: Ah , well
VICTORIA: Mr Grant . How good it is to see you .
MR GRANT: Your Majesty .
VICTORIA: Mrs Grant . How is your knee ? Has the pain eased a little ?
MRS GRANT: Oh not so bad , ma'am .
VICTORIA: Good . Oh and here are Douglas and John . Have n't you grown ?
MRS GRANT: Growing all the time , ma'am .
MR GRANT: Will you sit , ma'am ?
VICTORIA: I know that ! That 's Cairn Lochan . We picnicked there once , did we not , John ?
DISRAELI: Ah , the greasy pole .
MARY ANNE: Do n't be facetious , dear . Remembe your position .
DISRAELI: It 's my position I 'm thinking of .
STANLEY: I see the Prince of Wales is here .
DISRAELI: I hope he got his mother 's permission .
STANLEY: He is her personal servant , I believe .
DISRAELI: He would hardly make a very good personal assistant if he did not .
MRS GRANT: it 's not my best china . I mean , it is my best china now , but the family set got stolen last summer .
VICTORIA: Oh , I 'm so sorry
MRS GRANT: Of course it was no-one on the Estate . More likely one of the lads from Braemar . Or further even . I 'll fetch the salt .
BERTIE: Mr Disraeli . Ma'am .
DISRAELI: Your Royal Highness . What a pleasure to see you here .
BERTIE: Have you met Mr Lyle ? He 's in sugar ?
DISRAELI: I do n't think I 've had that pleasure .
BERTIE: No doubt you 've heard the rumors .
DISRAELI: I take no account of gossip , You Highness .
BERTIE: My concern is for the reputation of the Monarchy .
DISRAELI: Of course .
BERTIE: I fear the influence he has on her . The man 's word is not to be credited . He is an arriviste of the very lowest water . She 's having a bust cast of him . In Nero Marquino marble .
DISRAELI: I see .
BERTIE: I would talk to her myself , but she wo n't listen to me . She must be persuaded , by someone she respects , to abandon this ridiculous favoritism efore a situation develops .
DISRAELI: A situation ?
BERTIE: I do n't imagine you frequent the Republican Clubs . But the fact that neither you nor I are members should not blind us to the significance of their existence . The Tory Party has always been ou party .
DISRAELI: I 'm flattered you think so .
BERTIE: I tell you , if we do n't stick togethe on this , you could find yourself First President 's Opposition . Du Royaum Uni .
DISRAELI: Quite . A beat .
BERTIE: I do n't think we can overstate the seriousness of this .
STANLEY: What did he want ?
DISRAELI: To know when he 'll be king .
BROWN: so Grant here and myself are iding over Lochnagar and the rain 's pouring down in sheets and all we 're thinking about is getting home for a drink , when through the gloom Grant spots a couple of poachers . He gives me a shout and we chase them down towards the loch until Grant has you men up against the stacks and he 's shouting and cursing at them , `` Why are you poaching on Royal land ? ! '' And one of the little fellas looks up at him and says , `` coz we 've come up in the world . ''
JENNER: Your Majesty ! Thank goodness you 're safe ! I 'll have a bath prepared immediately . I recommend Macdonald 's African Embrocation
BROWN: Ah , pipe down , man . The woman 's fine .
VICTORIA: We stayed a little longer than expected with Mr and Mrs Grant . It was most agreeable .
PONSONBY: We were expecting you to return by six .
VICTORIA: And now I am back . BROWN can not resist one more little dig .
BROWN: We took a nip of whiskey .
VICTORIA: To keep out the cold .
BROWN: Aye .
VICTORIA: Thank you , John .
JENNER: She 's drunk .
PONSONBY: No , she was n't . Silence . JENNER turns to look at PONSONBY .
JENNER: Surely not PONSONBY 's face is set hard .
PONSONBY: Do n't even think about it .
JENNER: Pandora 's Box
VICTORIA: What is it , John ? John ?
BROWN: I heard something .
JOURNALIST 1: Where did he get to ? I 've lost him ?
JOURNALIST 2: I do n't know if there 's much worth writing about .
JOURNALIST 1: Hard to tell . BROWN rears up above them and stops .
BROWN: This close enough for you ? Go on ! On your way ! You filthy scavengers !
BERTIE'S VALET: We
BROWN: You 'll talk when I 'm finished !
JENNER: `` Court Circular , Balmoral . '' `` On Tuesday , Mr John Brown enjoyed a display of sheep-dipping by local farmers . On Wednesday , he attended a seance where he was pleased to listen to a recital of Auld Lang Syne by M Robert Burns himself ``
BROWN: If I find out that you had anything to do with this , I will have you sacked .
PONSONBY: I believe that decision rests with He Majesty .
BROWN: Do n't think I ca n't persuade her .
PONSONBY: I do n't doubt that the Queen was highly amused . She has always had a very healthy sense of humor .
BROWN: This is a slur on her good name .
PONSONBY: In as much as the article is about yourself , I think you must now accept that the public has a right to its interest in you .
BROWN: Nobody has any rights over me .
PONSONBY: We are all of us subject to forces eyond our control , Mr Brown , even you . BROWN stares at him in silence . A beat .
BROWN: You 'll regret saying that .
COUNTER: Ayes to the right , three hundred and thirty , noes to the left , two hundred and sixty-five
DILKE: Mr Speaker , I table a motion in furtherance of the Bill to Disestablish the Monarchy !
SPEAKER: Order ! Order ! ! ORDER ! ! !
DISRAELI: We 're going to lose .
STANLEY: You ca n't know that for sure .
DISRAELI: Gladstone 's got his party facing the same way for the first time in years . We need help . Where is the old girl ?
STANLEY: Who ?
DISRAELI: Mrs Brown .
STANLEY: It 's questionable whether there 's any advantage to be had from that direction . She 's never been less popular .
DISRAELI: In the press , perhaps . But she 's sold more copies of he Highland Journal in three months than Punch will ever sell in a year . Time to wheel her out .
STANLEY: She 's refusing to leave Balmoral .
DISRAELI: What 's her excuse this time ?
STANLEY: The Princess Louisa is too ill to move . Frankly , the Queen 's rathe upset at the recent spate of bad publicity . You 're smiling .
DISRAELI: I was trying to imagine `` rathe upset . ''
DEAN WELLSELLY: Forgive me , gentlemen . I 'm late .
DISRAELI: Not at all , Dean . Good of you to spare the time .
DEAN WELLSELLY: I came as quickly as I could .
DISRAELI: You 've seen the latest cartoon in Punch , I take it ?
DEAN WELLSELLY: I beg your pardon ?
DISRAELI: One of our madder brethren in the house was calling for disestablishment of the monarchy .
DEAN WELLSELLY: Good Lord .
STANLEY: I 'm sure it wo n't come to that .
DISRAELI: No . But it has now become a matte for our consciences . I was just telling Stanley how vital it is that the nation should feel the visible influence of the Sovereign . As a reminder that Parliament , indeed my own ministry , depends on the will of the Queen .
DEAN WELLSELLY: I could n't agree with you more , but I am only Dean of Windsor . I do n't understand what DISRAELI interrupts .
DISRAELI: We hear from Balmoral that Mr Brown is interesting Her Majesty in some of the forms of worship associated with low-church Presbyterian .
DEAN WELLSELLY: What can we do ?
DISRAELI: Oh , several things .
VICTORIA: Read it .
PONSONBY: Again ?
VICTORIA: Read it ! PONSONBY coughs once and begins again .
PONSONBY: `` The Times wishes to join the rest of Her Majesty 's loyal subjects in expressing its deep joy at the news that the Queen is soon to come out of her mourning . '' VICTORIA glowers at him .
VICTORIA: Who told them that ?
PONSONBY: I have no idea .
VICTORIA: Why not ?
PONSONBY: I forgive me , ma'am , I am no wise than yourself .
VICTORIA: No-one should think themselves wise than me ! It is not for any of the Queen 's subjects to presume to tell He Majesty when and where She should come out of mourning . It is the Queen 's sorrow that keeps her secluded ! It is Her overwhelming amount of work and esponsibility , work which She feels will soon wear her out entirely !
PONSONBY: Your Majesty
VICTORIA: Is it not enough that She is uncheered and unguided that she should also have to suffer these malicious rumors ? ! I am not a fool . I know there are those in the establishment too afraid to attack me and so they attack my dearest friends . Sometimes I feel that Brown is all I have left of Albert . And now they attack Brown too . She looks up , eyes blazing .
BERTIE: I wish to see my mother .
BROWN: She 's busy .
BERTIE: Convey her a message .
BROWN: She 's away to Windsor tomorrow . Talk to her there .
BERTIE: Tell her the Prince of Wales wishes to speak with her urgently about matters concerning the press .
BROWN: Are you deaf as well as stupid ? A split-second . BERTIE gapes at him .
BERTIE: What did you say ?
BROWN: I said , are you deaf as well as stupid ?
BERTIE: Do you know who you address , sir ?
BROWN: Whom you address .
BERTIE: The future King ! A beat .
BROWN: Well , everyone 's entitled to thei opinion .
BERTIE: Out of my way !
BROWN: LEAVE US ALONE , WHY DO N'T YOU ! !
VICTORIA: Must they always follow us ?
BROWN: I ordered it . It 's for your own safety .
VICTORIA: Dear me , you 'll be telling me to watch what I eat next . BROWN does n't react . A beat .
BROWN: Aye . But there are Fenians reported on the mainland .
VICTORIA: The threat from the Irish is greatly exaggerated , I 'm sure .
BROWN: I 'll decide when it 's exaggerated .
VICTORIA: Is anything the matter , John ? John ?
BROWN: Nothing 's the matter .
BARNEY: Mr Brown , sir
BROWN: It 's cold out there tonight , Barney .
BARNEY: Yeah , yeah , I did .
BROWN: Good man . And is she all right ?
BARNEY: Yeah .
BROWN: Good . She 's a good girl . Are n't you ? Yeah , she 's a lovely girl . And you know the Queen 's riding tomorrow ?
BARNEY: Yeah .
BROWN: Are you all right , Barney ?
VICTORIA: Well ?
LADY ELY: Mr Brown is unable to attend today .
VICTORIA: Why ?
LADY ELY: I believe he is unwell , ma'am .
VICTORIA: Unwell ?
LADY ELY: I understand he was in a fight .
VICTORIA: Has he been hurt ?
LADY ELY: I believe not , ma'am . I understand he 'd had rather too much to drink .
VICTORIA: You may go .
BROWN: And she sent no word down ?
ARCHIE: They said you were drunk . Why do n't you tell her the truth ?
BROWN: She 'll think it 's her fault fo keeping me .
ARCHIE: What are you doing ? !
BROWN: I 'm getting dressed .
ARCHIE: You 've got three broken ribs , man !
BROWN: I 've got my duties to attend to .
ARCHIE: Do n't be an idiot ! You 're in no fit state to go anywhere .
BROWN: She 'll be worried about me .
ARCHIE: She 'll get over it .
BROWN: I ca n't let her down now , Archie .
ARCHIE: And when was the last time she put herself out for you ? Look , John , whatever she says to you now , in the end you 're still a servant .
BROWN: Oh , I 'm much more than that .
ARCHIE: Aye , she may say that to you , but the woman can say what she wants .
BROWN: You watch your tongue .
ARCHIE: Come on , man , I 'm telling you what you already know .
BROWN: You know nothing about her !
ARCHIE: When are you gon na see it , John ? She does n't give a damn about you .
BROWN: From the Queen ! He reads out the inscription .
ARCHIE: Aye .
BROWN: She means it . ARCHIE stares at him .
ARCHIE: She 'll drop you . When she 's done with you , she 'll drop you .
BROWN: Get out . Out ! ARCHIE steps back but BROWN roars at him .
PONSONBY: to be followed by a visit from Lady Bridport . She is keen to secure a place for her niece as Maid of Honor . VICTORIA signs the last letter and sits back .
VICTORIA: I am tired . PONSONBY coughs .
PONSONBY: There is one other matter .
VICTORIA: What is it ?
PONSONBY: I have a letter , ma'am .
VICTORIA: From whom ?
PONSONBY: From Princess Helena and other members of your family .
VICTORIA: My family is quite capable of communicating with the Queen in person .
PONSONBY: They are demanding the dismissal of John Brown on grounds of drunkeness .
DEAN WELLSELLY: You wished to see me , ma'am ? She holds his eyes for a moment , then nods .
VICTORIA: My husband tried always to make me think more subtly . Of course he taught me so much and I can neve epay my debt to him , or the love I feel , even now . But , in truth , I think I am someone who can only feel things while they are alive to me . For that reason , I know I do not have a subtle mind . I know that . But I work hard and I try to do my duty . However , I have noticed of late that my feelings of grief are not so strong and that I find myself leaning more upon the comfort of living friends . Friends close to me now .
DEAN WELLSELLY: Your Majesty , a settled resignation is more lasting proof of affection than active grief . If the good Lord sees fit to bring one into contact with congenial fellow beings , one should not analyze one 's reaction too deeply . To allow oneself to be comforted by someone else need not imply any disloyalty to the memory of the loved one .
VICTORIA: Sir Henry . PONSONBY steps forward .
PONSONBY: Ma'am ?
VICTORIA: Please tell the Princess , and othe signatories to this letter , that the Queen will not be dictated to , or made to alter , in any way , what she has found to answer for her comfort . Do I make myself clear ?
PONSONBY: Ma'am . A beat .
VICTORIA: You may go . They all file out .
BROWN: Yes , ma'am ?
VICTORIA: I was told you were in a fight .
BROWN: Yes , ma'am .
VICTORIA: Has someone seen to those bruises ?
BROWN: Yes , ma'am . A beat .
VICTORIA: Yes ?
BROWN: Having considered my position here at court , I have come to the conclusion that it is in the best interest of Your Majesty that I should resign .
VICTORIA: I do not accept . A beat .
BROWN: I had foreseen that you would not . But Your Majesty should understand that my mind will not be changed in this . I leave for Deeside
VICTORIA: The Queen forbids it . I can not allow it because I can not live without you . Without you , I can not find the strength to be who I must be . Please .
BROWN: I promise .
VICTORIA: How dare the Irish break with the Anglicans ? If Albert were alive today he would never allow the Crown to give up Church patronage . No , the Irish must e told , very firmly , to stay exactly where they are . It is the thin edge of the wedge , Mr Disraeli . Next , you will be telling me that the Crown no longer governs this nation . A beat . A nervous silence in the Household .
DISRAELI: Your Majesty remains at the very epicenter of governance . As for you people , look no further than the sales of your Highland Journals to see in what affection the nation holds thei Queen . You sell even more copies than M Dickens .
VICTORIA: But I lack your prose , Mr Disraeli .
DISRAELI: Of course I understand your concern . You miss your people . And they miss you .
VICTORIA: Then they may read about me .
DISRAELI: Indeed , and for that they are eternally grateful .
VICTORIA: Is that not enough ?
DISRAELI: In so many ways and yet it is you presence they crave . A figurehead . VICTORIA has the measure of him .
VICTORIA: I never thought to be bullied by you , Mr Disraeli . You , I thought , understood a widow 's grief .
DISRAELI: Forgive me , ma'am , I can not speak fo the nation , only for myself . As Prime Minister I confess I miss you presence , but that is only an expression of my own selfish desires and I should not burden you with it .
VICTORIA: I stay here because I am happy . Is that such a terrible crime ?
DISRAELI: No , ma'am .
BROWN: Time for your walk .
VICTORIA: This is my good John Brown .
DISRAELI: Yes .
VICTORIA: I have asked him to show you a little of Highland life while you are with us at Balmoral . BROWN measures DISRAELI suspiciously .
BROWN: What brings you here ?
DISRAELI: A man can refuse only so many invitations from his Queen . It was emiss of me not to come earlier . VICTORIA smiles . BROWN stares .
BROWN: What do you know about the Highlands ?
DISRAELI: I am a blank sheet .
BROWN: Do you hunt ?
DISRAELI: Occasionally .
BROWN: Dare say you can be taught .
DISRAELI: To shoot perhaps , but not to kill .
BROWN: If you hunt , you kill . DISRAELI counters effortlessly .
DISRAELI: Well then , I 'll do my best .
BROWN: Always remember , you keep it tight to your shoulder , you absorb the kick . Aim for the head . Then imagine it 's Gladstone .
DISRAELI: Quite .
BROWN: Back doors , West Wing .
ASSISTANT DRESSER: Checked and locked , sir .
BROWN: Louder , girl !
ASSISTANT DRESSER: Checked and locked , sir .
BROWN: Kitchen and lower house .
BERTIE'S VALET: Checked and locked , sir .
BROWN: Back and upper corridors .
BERTIE'S VALET: Did you see any Irish assassins today , Mr Brown ? Brown does n't react .
BROWN: There 's not a soul here cares about that wee woman 's safety except me ! She 'd die in a ditch if I was n't there to look out for her
ARCHIE: What 's this ?
BROWN: It 's a diary .
ARCHIE: Be careful who sees it .
BROWN: What do you take me for ? ARCHIE turns back to BROWN .
ARCHIE: You should have someone look afte you .
BROWN: I 'm all right . I just need to rest up a wee bit . The room You do n't have to stay .
ARCHIE: The place is a mess .
BROWN: I ca n't move to tidy .
ARCHIE: It 's what the maids are for .
BROWN: I 'm not having some prattler going through my things . A beat .
ARCHIE: Wo n't you give yourself a rest , John ? She 's other people to look out fo her .
BROWN: She needs me , Archie . She canna do without me , she said it to my face . How can I stop now ?
DISRAELI: I 've been called back to London . My last day . I thought I might take a walk on Lochnagar . BROWN stares straight back .
BROWN: I do n't think about it .
DISRAELI: Forgive me , I 've called you out and you should have been resting .
BROWN: I 'm fine .
DISRAELI: You 're injured .
BROWN: It 's nothing .
DISRAELI: Still , someone must attend you . You wife should not have let you out .
BROWN: I 'm not married .
DISRAELI: Oh .
BROWN: This is the top .
DISRAELI: I confess , I sometimes feel as if I am not married myself , I see my wife so little . But I 'm forgetting the ewards . He looks across . BROWN keeps staring ahead .
BROWN: I would n't know .
DISRAELI: Surely
BROWN: What I do , I do for my Queen .
DISRAELI: Was there never ambition ?
BROWN: Maybe , once .
DISRAELI: Then I envy yo .
BROWN: Why ?
DISRAELI: To have achieved one 's ambition , or to have reconciled oneself to its limits , is a lifetime 's work .
BROWN: I do what I do .
DISRAELI: For Her Majesty .
BROWN: Aye .
DISRAELI: But yourself ? What about John Brown ?
BROWN: I said . I serve the Queen .
DISRAELI: No other aspiration ?
BROWN: To see her safe . DISRAELI steps a little closer .
DISRAELI: You will not be unaware of the threat now posed by Republicanism .
BROWN: Why do you think I keep her here ?
DISRAELI: Ah , but therein lies the paradox . It is her very isolation that encourages the malcontents . The longer she is away , the stronger they become ; and who , honestly , can promise security against that ? However many doors you lock , someone will always get in . Even here . BROWN watches him , eyes alert .
BROWN: So ?
DISRAELI: The truth is , the Queen would be safe doing her duty and returning south to her public . John Bull loves her and John Bull is her best defense .
BROWN: Her mind is set . She wo n't change now .
DISRAELI: She trusts you , John .
BROWN: They do n't see it .
DISRAELI: See what ?
BROWN: The threat . I tell them , but they do n't see it .
DISRAELI: They are n't as watchful as you .
BROWN: Too busy looking after themselves .
DISRAELI: The greasy pole .
BROWN: No loyalty .
DISRAELI: No love .
BROWN: I promised to protect her from people like you .
DISRAELI: For once in my life , I am not the issue .
BROWN: She 'll never understand it .
DISRAELI: In time , she will .
BROWN: She 'll think I betrayed her .
DISRAELI: But others will know that you acted for the greater good . BROWN stares off into the distance .
VICTORIA: I received a letter today from M Disraeli . Parliament is calling fo my return to public duties . Why wo n't they let us be ? BROWN does not answer .
BROWN: We ca n't always have what we wish . VICTORIA stares at him .
VICTORIA: Duty ? ! You talk about duty ? !
BROWN: If duty and safety are served by the same end then , aye , I do .
VICTORIA: I can not believe you are saying this ? You , who I have relied on all this time
BROWN: Have I ever let you down before ?
VICTORIA: You stand there and tell me it is my duty after all you promised me !
BROWN: I 'm breaking no promises !
VICTORIA: You are forcing me to do the very thing you know I fear most !
BROWN: For god 's sake , woman , I 'm just trying to keep you safe !
VICTORIA: I will not hear any more about my safety ! ! You made me a promise and now you have broken it ! BROWN rounds on her , deeply wounded .
BROWN: When I took you out riding , come ain or shine , because I knew it was ight for you , when I kept the bairns off your back so you could have a bit of peace , when I saw you safe from home to home and you did n't even know I was there ! All I 've ever thought about is you !
VICTORIA: Then why send me back to them ? !
BROWN: Because I have to ! ( pause Will you no listen to me , woman ?
VICTORIA: Do not presume to talk to your Queen in that manner .
PONSONBY: May I say , how glad I am to see You Majesty so much recovered .
VICTORIA: Where is my son ?
PRINCESS ALEXANDRA: Prince Albert is at Windsor , ma'am .
VICTORIA: Why is he not here ?
PRINCESS ALEXANDRA: He is sick , ma'am .
VICTORIA: Then why are you not with him ?
PRINCESS ALEXANDRA: You ordered all members of the Royal Family to attend you at Balmoral .
VICTORIA: What is the matter with him ?
PRINCESS ALEXANDRA: He has typhoid fever , ma'am . VICTORIA stares blankly at DOCTOR JENNER .
VICTORIA: No . You are mistaken . Prince Albert , my husband , had typhoid fever . I asked what was wrong with my son .
JENNER: The same , your Majesty .
VICTORIA: Why was I not informed ?
JENNER: I did not consider it wise , in the circumstances , to tax your nerves .
VICTORIA: How ill is he ? No answer .
JENNER: Better .
VICTORIA: Should the good Lord see fit to spare my son , I will order a mass to be celebrated at St. George 's . The people must share with their Queen , her prayers and hopes for their future King .
PONSONBY: The Queen will be riding to St. George 's on the fifth .
BROWN: I recommend Her Majesty uses the covered carriage with a full Horse Guard . In the event of any disturbance I will ensure
VICTORIA: I will ride to St. George 's in an open carriage . It is time the Queen was seen by her public .
BROWN: NO ! !
BERTIE: all seven stone of the man , paddling madly towards us through a sea of Horse Guards , waving something that looks vaguely like a pen . I thought he must be one of the mother 's ardent readership in search of the Royal indenture
VICTORIA: I intend Brown to be rewarded with a special medal cast in gold . It will e called The Devoted Service Medal .
BERTIE: A toast . Victoria Regina ! The others raise their glasses in unison .
EVERYONE: Victoria Regina !
DISRAELI: If the first great object of the Tory Party is to maintain the institutions of the country , the second is , in my opinion , to maintain the Empire of England the hereditary , the traditionary policy of the Tory Party . Go to your homes , teach them these truths , which will soon be imprinted on the conscience of the land
PAGE: North woods , sir . BROWN grabs his gun and rushes out .
BROWN: God save the Queen ! ! And fires .
VICTORIA: How long has he been this sick ?
LADY ELY: A few days , ma'am .
VICTORIA: Why was I not told earlier ?
BROWN: Someone has to look after you . It could 've been someone . It was efore .
VICTORIA: Yes . Yes it was .
BROWN: Do n't be silly , woman .
JENNER: Erysipelas .
PONSONBY: Not too protracted , I hope .
JENNER: A few days When he heard , the Prince of Wales threw the bust from the window of the Royal Gallery . It took four hours to gather the fragments . A beat .
PONSONBY: The Queen wishes to publish an account of him .
JENNER: Dear oh dear .
PONSONBY: We think she can be dissuaded . Have you had a glance at the diary ?
JENNER: Yes .
PONSONBY: Quite . I think I 'd best take it back .
JENNER: Of course .
PONSONBY: Some young page was boasting about having seen it . Lucky . JENNER nods .
JENNER: Well , no rest for the wicked , Henry .
PONSONBY: No , indeed .
ELLIS: I 'm comin ' out now .
MARY LEE: I just want to have a conversation . I just want to talk about it .
NECKBONE: What the shit man ?
ELLIS: Suck it . Drive .
NECKBONE: How old is she ?
ELLIS: A Junior .
NECKBONE: She 's got nice titties . You talk to her ?
ELLIS: Nah .
NECKBONE: You 're gon na have to talk to her .
ELLIS: I know .
NECKBONE: Remind me when we get back to my house , Galen 's got a book on that .
ELLIS: I 'm not worried about my dad killin ' us .
NECKBONE: What if it sinks ?
ELLIS: It ai n't gon na sink . We got ta move if we 're gon na make it back . Set your watch . We 'll need a good fifteen minutes .
ELLIS: Yeah , there it is .
NECKBONE: Motor broke off .
ELLIS: Who else knows about this ?
NECKBONE: Just me and Galen .
ELLIS: What 's he think ?
NECKBONE: He do n't care about it .
ELLIS: Good .
NECKBONE: It 's got its own shitbox
ELLIS: This is perfect .
NECKBONE: Ho-Lee-Shit .
ELLIS: Neck .
NECKBONE: Look at that beave . You got ta see this .
ELLIS: Neck .
NECKBONE: What ?
ELLIS: Someone 's here .
NECKBONE: What ? Ellis holds the loaf of bread up to Neckbone .
ELLIS: Someone 's livin ' here .
NECKBONE: Shit .
ELLIS: We got ta go . I ca n't be late .
NECKBONE: What are you doing ?
NECKBONE: Shit . Let 's go .

ELLIS: What 's that mean ?
SENIOR: She seems set on it . Wants to separate . She may ask me for a divorce .
ELLIS: What 's that mean for me ?
SENIOR: It means enjoy the river son . Enjoy it while you live on it , 'cause this way a life is n't long for this world . Game and fish 's 'bout made certain of that .
ELLIS: But you and me can still live out here . Game and fish ca n't take your boat . Not while you 're still in it .
SENIOR: The houseboat 's in your mother 's name . Her daddy give it to her not me . If she wants to leave it , Game and Fish has ever ' right to take this boat apart board by board .
ELLIS: But that ai n't right . You work outta here . We got the ice machine , the traps . What are we supposed to do ?
SENIOR: Like I said , this is your mother 's usiness .
ELLIS: I ai n't no townie . I ai n't livin ' like that .

SENIOR: I do n't know about that anymore .
MARY LEE: You 're late .
MUD: Ellis ?
ELLIS: I got you some Beanie Weenie .
MUD: I appreciate that , but I did n't expect you out here at night .
ELLIS: That 's all my mom had .
MUD: I 'm not complainin ' .
ELLIS: Can I get one of those ?
MUD: They 're yours to begin with . Ellis sits as Mud hands him a can . They eat .
ELLIS: I missed my dinner .
MUD: That 's good right ?
MOUTH FULL: You been out here too long .
MUD: Juniper . Yeah .
ELLIS: How 'd you meet her ?
MUD: We grew up together .
ELLIS: Do you love her ?
MUD: I do . The first time I saw her was on this river . Just up from here . She saved my life .
ELLIS: From the snake bite .
MUD: That 's right . I was younger than you are now , but when I came to in the hospital and she was there , it was like the world split open , came ack together new . Everything changed . I knew from then on I 'd do anything for her .
ELLIS: Why are n't ya 'll married ?
MUD: I 've asked . Several times . Marriage just does n't work for some people . Ellis thinks on this .
ELLIS: My dad says my parents may be gettin ' a divorce .
MUD: I 'm sorry to hear that .
ELLIS: If it happens , and my mom moves us off the river , they say the government can come take our boat away .
MUD: Who says that ?
ELLIS: Everybody . They passed a law so you ca n't sell your boat . Ca n't ent it . If the owner leaves , they got you . Game and Fish want ` em off the river .
MUD: I 've never been one to trust the government on matters of personal property , but if your parents love each other , there 's always a chance .
ELLIS: I saw Juniper today .
MUD: What ?
ELLIS: I did n't talk to her , but she had the birds tattooed on her hand like you said . You were right . She 's pretty .
MUD: Where 'd you see her ?
ELLIS: At the Piggly Wiggly . I think she 's stayin ' at a motel by there . The Executive Inn .
MUD: That 's good news . Real good news . Mud paces , slowly . He 's thinking .
ELLIS: Does she know you 're out here ?
MUD: No . We picked another place to meet . Couple days from now . Mud walks back to the log and sits .
ELLIS: You wan na go tonight ? I can give you a ride up river . Mud looks at Ellis , nodding .
MUD: Tomorrow . I 'll go tomorrow .
ELLIS: You need me to come get you ?
MUD: Naw . I can manage . Hell I got out here did n't I ? Ellis smiles .
MARY LEE: Time to get up .
ELLIS: It 's Saturday .
MARY LEE: I 'm going to Wal-Mart . I need you to come with me .
MOANING: Mom .
MARY LEE: Come on . She pulls the covers off of him .
ELLIS: What do you wan na talk about ? You want to leave and that means they can tear up our house .
MARY LEE: I 've spent my whole life on that oat . I do n't think it 's too much to ask for your
TROOPER: Can you open the trunk please ma'am ?
MARY LEE: Of course .
TROOPER: Have you picked up or seen any hitchhikers today ma'am ?
MARY LEE: No sir .
TROOPER: Have you seen this man ?
MARY LEE: No sir .
TROOPER: Son , have you seen this man ?
ELLIS: No .
TROOPER: We 've had reports that he 's in this area . If you see him , call 9-1-1 immediately .
MARY LEE: We will officer . The Trooper pulls his head from the window .
ELLIS: What 'd he do ? !
MORE CALM: What 'd he do ?
TROOPER: Move along please .
MARY LEE: My lord .
NO ANSWER: Please do n't tell your father this , ut I 've been looking at a couple of places . I know it would be a ig adjustment for you , but it might end up being something you like . You know living on the rive is n't exactly everyone 's idea of the good life . Ellis ? He looks at her .
ELLIS: Neck ! Neck , pick up !
NECKBONE: So what 's the big deal ?
ELLIS: My mom and I were headed to Wal- Mart on 165 . There was a roadblock with state troopers . They searched our car and showed us a picture of Mud . They 're lookin ' for him .
NECKBONE: I knew it ! I told you that crazy sonofabitch was trouble . Did they say what he did ?
ELLIS: No .
NECKBONE: So 'd you tell ` em where he is ?
ELLIS: No . That 's why I called you . We got ta warn him .
NECKBONE: What ?
ELLIS: He 's goin ' to get Juniper today . I went out there last night and told him where we saw her . He needs to know people are lookin ' for him .
NECKBONE: You think he does n't know that already ? Jesus Ellis , why do you think he 's on that island ? You do n't even know what he 's wanted for .
ELLIS: He loves her Neck . He told me .
NECKBONE: I do n't give a shit who he loves .
ELLIS: He 's not dangerous .
NECKBONE: It sounds like a shitload of state troopers think different .
ELLIS: He may already be gone .
MUD: I 'm gon na have to go back on ou deal for the boat . I do n't feel good about it , but I do n't see any other way outta what I 'm into .
ELLIS: So you know about the state troopers ? He looks up from his notebook .
MUD: What state troopers ?
NECKBONE: The ones spreadin ' your picture all over the place . Stoppin ' cars on 165 searchin ' for your ass .
MUD: I did n't know about that , but it does n't surprise me . There plenty of folks lookin ' for me right now .
ELLIS: Why ?
MUD: I shot a man . Killed him .
NECKBONE: Who 'd you kill ?
MUD: It was a bad piece of business . Ya 'll do n't need to hear about it .
ELLIS: I need to hear about it .
MUD: Juniper made a mistake . She hooked up with a guy . He was no good . His name was Hutchins . Family owns a chain of restaurants down in Texas .
ELLIS: Where were you ?
MUD: I was around , but me and Junipe were on the outs . She met this Hutchins , he sold her on some lies . Got her pregnant . That 's when he started showin ' who he really was . He dropped June down a flight of stairs after whoopin ' her half to death . She lost the baby . He made it so the doctors think she ca n't have children anymore . There 're things you can get away with in this world and things you ca n't . I tracked him down at a motel just outside of San Antonio . He was there with another woman . That 's where it happened .
ELLIS: You did it for her ? To protect her ?
MUD: Yeah .
NECKBONE: I think you want us to run around , stickin ' our necks out , gettin ' everything you need , just so you can take our boat .
MUD: That 's about it .
NECKBONE: What do we get out of it ?
MUD: What do you want ?
NECKBONE: What about that pistol ?
MUD: I only got two things out here worth anything . This shirt
NECKBONE: What kind is it ?
MUD: A forty five .
NECKBONE: I guess we could work a deal like that .
MUD: We get this thing floatin ' first . Neckbone looks over at Ellis , who shrugs .
NECKBONE: All right then .
MUD: Ya 'll scrounge what you can off this list , but if we 're gon na get this done right we 'll need more help . Can you fetch Tom for me ?
ELLIS: Tom Blankenship ?
MUD: I was hopin ' to let that old assassin stay put , but we 'll need him to get things ya 'll ca n't . Can you find him ?
ELLIS: I know where he lives , but I 've never spoke to him .
MUD: Just tell him my name . He 'll know you 're serious .
THEY PAUSE: Thanks . Ellis nods .
NECKBONE: Do n't lose my pistol .
ELLIS: You comin ' ?
NECKBONE: I 'll watch the boat .
ELLIS: What ?
NECKBONE: Be careful . Galen always said that old man 's crazy .
ELLIS: I ai n't huntin you .
TOM: What 's your business here ?
ELLIS: I came to find you . I got a message for you .
TOM: You 're Senior 's boy .
ELLIS: Yessir .
TOM: What you got to say he ca n't tell me himself ?
ELLIS: It ai n't from him .
TOM: Mud sent you .
ELLIS: Yessir .
TOM: What do you know about it ?
ELLIS: He asked me to come get you .
TOM: Your daddy know this ?
ELLIS: No sir . Mud needs your help .
TOM: Where is he ?
ELLIS: There he is .
TOM: Mud .
MUD: Sir .
NECKBONE: You think that 's his dad ?
ELLIS: I do n't know .
TOM: Where is she ?
MUD: In town . Got here yesterday . Tom lowers his head . Frustrated .
TOM: Why you out here like this ?
NECKBONE: They do n't look like family .
TOM: You 've spent your whole life followin ' that girl ! She 's run you halfway cross the country and back , and for what ? For this , left out on an island beggin ' for help . A murderer . A thief .
MUD: I ai n't no thief .
TOM: What would you call it then ? Do n't even mention draggin ' those boys into this . Do you have any idea what you 're doin ' ? Waits for a response , but Mud gives none .
TO HIMSELF: Dammit .
ELLIS: You all right ? Mud raises his head .
MUD: Looks like we 're on our own .
ELLIS: Yeah .
MUD: You have to be careful . You ca n't just walk up and knock on her door , you hear me ? You have to watch yourself .
ELLIS: I can handle it .
NECKBONE: You Mud 's daddy ?
TOM: Mud did n't have no daddy . No mother I ever knew of . He was livin ' in the woods when I met him . Younger than you are now .
ELLIS: What do you think ?
NECKBONE: He loves her . You can tell that much . You gon na take it to her ?
ELLIS: I told him I would .
NECKBONE: I do n't know . Could be a lot of trouble .
ELLIS: You still got that trailer you made for your bike ?
NECKBONE: All right .
BLACK MAN: What you want ?
ELLIS: We 're sellin ' fish . You wan na buy some ?
BLACK MAN: Fish ?
ELLIS: I don'tI
CARVER: I know you know where he is . And I swear to God I 'll cut through every one a you to find him .
NECKBONE: You all right ?
ELLIS: Yeah .
NECKBONE: He popped your eye .
JUNIPER: Thank you .
ELLIS: Mud sent us to give this to you .
JUNIPER: You 've met Mud ? Ellis nods . Neckbone speaks up from the back .
NECKBONE: Yeah we met him .
JUNIPER: He tells me to hold tight .
NECKBONE: Yeah , we read it . Juniper raises her eyebrows at Neckbone .
JUNIPER: Well do you know how long ` hold tight ' is ?
ELLIS: I think it 's a couple days . He wants to get a boat for ya 'll .
JUNIPER: God .
ELLIS: We wo n't .
JUNIPER: What do you call that ?
ELLIS: We 'll be all right . Keep your doo locked . We 'll be in touch .
JUNIPER: Wait . Ellis turns back .
ELLIS: I 'm Ellis . That 's Neckbone .
JUNIPER: Thank you Ellis . Ellis stares at her , infatuated .
NECKBONE: We got ta go .
ELLIS: Lock the door .
NECKBONE: Let 's go hard on .
ELLIS: Hello ? Is May Pearl there ? This is EllisHey , it 's Ellis . Hey What ? In the phone book from his car commercialsI think they 're all rightTomorrow ? Yeah , I can meet you Okay . Bye .
NECKBONE: We 've got more , but no motor .
MUD: This 'll work for now . You get he my note ?
ELLIS: Yeah .
MUD: Where 'd you get that from ?
ELLIS: We came up on Juniper 's room . A guy was in there beatin ' up on her . Mud 's face turns dark .
NECKBONE: Ellis rushed him . Got smacked fo it .
MUD: What 'd he look like ?
ELLIS: I do n't know . Tall . Looked like a cowboy .
MUD: Dark hair ?
ELLIS: Yeah .
NECKBONE: More what ?
MUD: Bounty hunters . Carver 's rotten , ut his daddy 's the one to be scared of . He 'll spend all the money he has to see me dead . If it was up to me I 'd put the whole family down same as the other . Not a decent man between ` em .
HELPER: What you waitin ' for ?
GALEN: Shut up .
MUD: Ellis , can you climb up that trunk and get these hung ?
ELLIS: Yeah .
MUD: Take a foot of line and tie ` em off with a bowline knot . You know it ?
ELLIS: I 'm not stupid .
MUD: Neck , start cuttin ' line . Three fifteen foot sections . Count a foot long as your arm .
NECKBONE: What 's so special ` bout that shirt you 'd lose your pistol for it ?
MUD: It 's got a wolf 's eye sewn in the sleeve . More protection than a ullet ever gave . Tom swears by it .
NECKBONE: He said he was n't your daddy .
MUD: Tom 's the closest thing I ever knew to a father .
NECKBONE: I never met my parents .
MUD: It 's hard not knowin ' the ones you came from .
NECKBONE: My uncle Galen tells me things about ` em . He 's the one that takes care of me .
MUD: Tom did that for me .
ELLIS: What 'd you mean when you called Tom an assassin ?
MUD: Tom 's had lives you 'd never know about . Grew up up North . Went to Yale . For a long time he was a paid killer for the C.I.A . Lived in Cuba in ` 63 . He 's probably killed more people than you 've met .
TO NECKBONE: Hand me that line .
NECKBONE: Well if you 're gon na do it do it !
MUD: One down !
NECKBONE: This shit is crazy .
MARY LEE: You look nice .
ELLIS: Thanks .
MARY LEE: What time are you gon na be home ?
ELLIS: You make up your mind ?
MARY LEE: About moving in town ?
ELLIS: About leavin ' dad .
MARY LEE: You ca n't make other people change Ellis . If I 'm unhappy then I 'll have to be the one to change something .
ELLIS: Not really .
MAY PEARL: But you 're not scared if you have to .
ELLIS: I guess . You got a lot of friends .
MAY PEARL: They 're all right . I do n't know all of ` em .
ELLIS: I bet you 're pretty popular .
MAY PEARL: Why do you say that ?
ELLIS: I do n't know . ` Cause you 're nice to people .
MAY PEARL: How do you know that ?
ELLIS: You 're nice to me .
MAY PEARL: But I like you . Ellis digs into his jeans pocket .
ELLIS: I got this for you .
MAY PEARL: A bracelet ?
ELLIS: Neckbone 's uncle caught the pearls . I thought with your name and everything
MAY PEARL: Thank you .
ELLIS: You wan na be my girlfriend ? She smiles , then kisses him .
TOM: You want some coffee ? Tom disappears inside .
ELLIS: I do n't drink coffee .
TOM: You been seein ' Mud ?
ELLIS: No .
TOM: You do n't have to lie to me boy .
ELLIS: He 's okay .
TOM: He get that boat down ? Ellis nods . There is an awkward moment .
ELLIS: He called you an assassin . Tom snorts out a laugh , sips his coffee .
TOM: How long have you known Mud ?
ELLIS: Few days .
TOM: Well that 's long enough to know he 's full of shit .
ELLIS: So it 's not true .
TOM: I was a sharpshooter in the army . In Mud 's world , that makes me an assassin . Not exactly true , right ?
ELLIS: Yeah I guess . Tom notices the boy 's disappointment .
TOM: You think he 's a bad ass do n't you ?
ELLIS: I do n't know .
TOM: You know why he 's stuck out on that island ?
ELLIS: Yeah .
HESITATES: He shot somebody .
TOM: He tell you why he shot that man ?
ELLIS: Because he hurt Juniper .
TOM: Right . The real reason Mud 's in the trouble he 's got is because of her . He 's been in love with that girl since he was your age . They used to run all around here and it was the same back then . He 'd follow that girl wherever she led him . Problem is she do n't care about nobody but herself . I 've told him as much . She 'd bed down with the meanest snake she could find , then when things went bad she 'd go runnin ' to Mud . Mud would take her back , then go find whatever unlucky sonofabitch last put a hand on her and beat ` em ` til they knew to never touch her again . And this time I guess he thought a eating was n't good enough . Had to shoot that fella . I do n't know fo sure , but I 'd put money on Junipe knowin ' he 'd do it . And I have a suspicion she might of even told him to . Either way , those two are set for failure . Only chance Mud has is to cut her loose . Cause I 'll tell you what , Mud 's no bad ass . He 's runnin ' scared .
ELLIS: I got ta go . Ellis heads for the door , but stops short .
MUD: You find a motor ?
ELLIS: Not yet . What 's that ?
MUD: I made a bonfire . Mud enters the woods . Ellis follows .
ELLIS: Why ?
MUD: Bonfire 's an all purpose cure all for bad luck . I do n't know where this boat 's been or what kind of person had it before me . For all I know it could have some serious bad usiness left on it . We got too much ridin ' on this thing to leave to chance . Where 's Neckbone ?
ELLIS: Helpin ' his uncle with a dive .
MUD: What he say ?
ELLIS: He was runnin ' down Juniper .
MUD: You do n't know his story .
ELLIS: I do n't care .
MUD: You should . Tom loved a woman more than most men could in two lifetimes . They had a good life started together .
ELLIS: I got ta go help my dad . Mud turns back but does n't stop moving .
MUD: Thanks for the wood Ellis .
GALEN: This shit never gets easy .

NECKBONE: You touch her breast ?
ELLIS: A little .
NECKBONE: That 's great man .
ELLIS: Thanks .
NECKBONE: It 's welded . We 'd just tear it up . What if we float it out ?
ELLIS: With what ?
NECKBONE: Come on . Neckbone walks to the trailer . Ellis follows .
GALEN: What do you think ?
NECKBONE: That 's real good Galen .
TO ELLIS: Gim me a minute .
GALEN: Come ` ere Ellis .
ELLIS: Yeah .
GALEN: I found it in the river . Works great . Best ceiling fan I 've eve owned . This river brings a lotta trash down it . Some a that trash is worth a lotta money , some of it 's not . You got ta know what 's worth keepin ' and what 's worth lettin ' go . You know the difference ?
ELLIS: I think so .
GALEN: Neck looks up to you . Do n't get my nephew into anything you ca n't get him out of .

ELLIS: She did n't meet up with us .
MUD: What happened ? Was it Carver ?
ELLIS: It was n't Carver . Mud straightens up , prepares for the news .
MUD: What 's goin ' on Ellis ?
ELLIS: She was supposed to meet us on the side of the motel . She neve showed up . We went asking for her . The motel clerk told us she went to a bar out on 61 .
MUD: What ?
ELLIS: We tracked her down . She was there with another guy .
HESITATES: They were together .
MUD: She probably thought Carver was on to her .
ELLIS: She knew the plan Mud . She just did n't show up .
MUD: What was she doin ' with the othe guy ?
ELLIS: They were playin ' pool . Drinkin ' . He was close up on her . They were laughin ' . He kissed her on the neck . Mud nods .
MUD: And that 's how it is .

MARY LEE: Take your hands off him Senior !
SENIOR: J.J. Crawford said a boat moto went missin ' from his stock yard . Said his daughter saw this one and his friend haulin ' it off . This makes Mary Lee pause .
ELLIS: We did n't steal it .
SENIOR: Lie to me again .
ELLIS: We thought it was junk . We did n't think it was worth anything .
MARY LEE: Ellis ?
SENIOR: You tell me I raised a thief ?
ELLIS: I 'm not a thief .
SENIOR: You take property that 's not yours . Property that belongs to anothe man . That junk is his livelihood . I 'm ashamed of you . Ellis drops his head . His face flushed .
MARY LEE: Senior .
SENIOR: Shut your mouth . You think you can take things and not have him see it ? Neither one of you has any espect for a man 's livelihood . A life that puts clothes on your back and food in your stomach .
MARY LEE: Do n't you blame this on me . One does n't have a thing to do with the other and you know it .
SENIOR: Do n't tell me what I know . If you can steal a man 's life out from under him in front of your son and think he wo n't take a lesson from it than you 're even dumber than you look .
ELLIS: Stop it dad .
SENIOR: She 's raisin ' you a snake like herself , and you can curl up with her ` fore I give a damn . You just emember this when you watch them ip this house apart board by oard . You Hear Me !
MARY LEE: You 're a man who 's never had the strength to support his own life . I never asked you for a thing , and I 've never took a thing from you that I could n't provide for on my own . If they do tear my home apart the only joy I 'll have in my heart is knowin ' that they 'll be tearing you out of my life for good .
ELLIS: I ca n't take that motor back . But I 'll pay him for it . I 'll pay him what he wants for it .
SENIOR: I do n't care what you do Ellis .
NECKBONE: What the hell 's all this ?
ELLIS: It 's a bonfire .
NECKBONE: I guess he did n't care about bein ' seen .
ELLIS: He had something else on his mind . Come on . Ellis leads Neckbone into the treeline .
MUD: What are ya 'll hidin ' for ?
ELLIS: We found your shirt . Ellis tosses it to him . Mud tosses it back .
MUD: Keep it . I do n't need it anymore .
ELLIS: We saw what 's left of your bonfire .
NO RESPONSE: Somebody could 've seen you .
MUD: I guess .
ELLIS: You do some drinkin ' last night ?
MUD: I did a lot of drinkin ' last night .
ELLIS: Okay Mud .
MUD: Let 's go .
ELLIS: You still takin ' Juniper ?
MUD: I had a dream last night . I saw Juniper laying in a field with another man . They were making love . I walked out into the field . Walked toward ` em . I was so angry the tips of my ears were burnin ' . That 's how I knew I was gon na kill this man . But when I got up close enough , I saw that the man she was with had tattoos on his back , just like mine . I moved in closer and the guy turns his head back toward me . Hair for hair , dead truth , the guy she was with was me .
NECKBONE: You be all right ?
ELLIS: Yeah . What about you ?
NECKBONE: He 'll be okay .
ELLIS: Can I borrow your bike ?
NECKBONE: Do n't tump it .
ELLIS: Hello . I saw the guy you 're lookin ' forYeah , he 's crazy lookin ' . Saw him at the Wal-mart outside of Gillet . He was buyin ' some beanie weenie'bout five minutes ago .
JUNIPER: I was wonderin ' when I 'd see you .
ELLIS: I 'm supposed to give this to you . Juniper takes the letter .
JUNIPER: Okay .
ELLIS: No . I got ta go .
JUNIPER: Ellis ? He turns to her .
ELLIS: All you had to do was be there .
JUNIPER: I could n't .
ELLIS: Then why 'd you even come here ?
JUNIPER: I came here to leave with him . I eally did . But nownow I guess I just came to say goodbye . His eyes fall to the floor .
ELLIS: I know he 'd do anything for you .
JUNIPER: You really believe that ?
ELLIS: What 's it say ?
JUNIPER: It says it 's over . Tell him I 've packed my things . Tell him I 've gone . She takes a deep breath and smiles at him .
KYLE: So what 'd she say ?
MAY PEARL: She said she did n't like him that much . I told her I thought he was all right .
ELLIS: You get my phone calls ?
MAY PEARL: What ?
ELLIS: I 've been callin ' you . Who 's this guy ?
KYLE: Get your head outta my car kid .
MAY PEARL: Ellis !

ELLIS: I 'm sorry , I just wanted to know why you had n't called me back .
MAY PEARL: Why would I call you back Ellis ?
ELLIS: Because you 're my girlfriend . The crowd is watching .
MAY PEARL: I 'm not your girlfriend ! We went on one date . One !
ELLIS: We kissed .

BETTY: I am , Mrs. Lanois . It is Mrs. Lanois is n't it ?
MRS. LANOIS: In all my living glory , baby .
BETTY: Pleased to meet you .
MRS. LANOIS: You can call me Coco everybody does . Stay there , I 'll get the key .
BETTY: Okay , Coco .
COCO: I guess it was your grandfather , was it he called me to check in , said you were on your way and for you to call when you get in . Nice man farmer I hear .
BETTY: Yes , he is . He raises corn .
COCO: Damn lot of corn raised in Hollywood these days too .
BETTY: Well , I
COCO: You do n't have to tell me . It 's written all over that pretty face of yours.. You came here to be an actress . I just hope you 'll remember there 's never been a great poem called `` tits and ass . ''
COCO: You probably do n't remember her , but Louise Bonner lives right over there in number 29 . When she is n't drunk she runs a damn good acting class .
BETTY: Have many famous actors and actresses lived here ? I was meaning to ask you that .
COCO: Honey , all the great ones came through here at one time or another .
BETTY: I guess I 've come to quite a place .
COCO: Sweetheart , you do n't know the half of it .
BETTY: No , I do n't .
COCO: That 's good . They 're allowed , but I do n't like 'emfor obvious reasons . One man used to live here that had a prize fighting kangaroo . You would n't elieve what that kangaroo did to this courtyard let 's see your Aunt 's apartment it 's a good one .
BETTY: I can hardly wait , Coco .
COCO: I told ya .
BETTY: Wow !
COCO: Now I guess you and your Aunt have an understanding . So here 's the key and you need anything , just give a holler . Everybody in this building 's pretty much okay with me or they would n't be here . If you want , later I 'll introduce you around . No hard feelings if you do n't , and do n't forget the rooftop garden . It 's just up the stairs we passed . It 's open to all the tenants . You can see the Hollywood sign from there .
BETTY: Oh Coco thank you . Thank you so much .
COCO: You got it ! See you later honey .
BETTY: Oh my !
RITA: No .I .

RITA: She has pretty red hair she is very kind I think .
BETTY: She sure is . She 's letting me stay here while she 's working on a movie that 's eing made in Canada , but I guess you know that . I could n't afford a place like this in a million years . Unless of course I 'm discovered and become a movie star . Of course , I 'd rather be known as a great actress than a movie star , but sometimes people end up being both and that is , I guess you 'd say , sort of why I came here . I 'm sorry , I 'm just so excited to be here..I mean I just came here from Iowa and now I 'm in this dream place . You can imagine how I feel .
RITA: I think I 've been hurt .
BETTY: Oh
RITA: No .
BETTY: But , this could be serious .
RITA: NoI need to sleep .
BETTY: If you have a concussion you should n't sleep .
RITA: It will be okay if I sleep . I need to lie down and sleep .
BETTY: All right , butI 'm going to check on you .

Sure , you can have the couch . No , it 's no problem..it 's just I got ta I got ta work . Any chance you could bring some food . No , I got plenty of money - I just have n't gone out fo awhile . Groovy man !
BETTY: What are you doing ?
RITA: You 've been so good to me now we know why why I was so afraid . We know what kind of trouble I 'm in . I should n't ask you I only have this to offer . I 'll give you this if I can stay here fo awhile . I do n't know what else to do .
BETTY: Rita I want you to stay here and you do n't have to give me that money .
RITA: But I want to .
BETTY: No . We should n't touch that money . We do n't know about that money . That might e dangerous money . You have to start all over again . You look like a brand new person and you can be a brand new person whoever you want to be .
RITA: It sounds kind of nice being somebody and new .
BETTY: Hey , let 's introduce the brand new you to Hollywood . We have n't seen the roof garden yet .
RITA: Here I am Hollywood ! My name is Rita .
LANDLADY: not very fancy house needs epairs We have n't had a man around here for so long
MUMFORD: That 's all the time we have . Sorry next time .
FOLLETT: I have eighteen more minutes !
MUMFORD: I do n't want to hear any more today .
FOLLETT: Why not ?
MUMFORD: Mr. Follett , do you trust me or do n't you ?
FOLLETT: Well , I do n't know I only been seeing you
MUMFORD: Without trust , there 's no point to any of this . You might as well not come .
FOLLETT: Now hold on , I did n't say I did n't want to come
MUMFORD: Good , then go .
LILY: You 're early it 's not ready . What happened ?
MUMFORD: My patient had to leave early .
LILY: Who was that ?
MUMFORD: Does the phrase `` nosy '' have any meaning to you , Lily ?
LILY: I think it 's like inquisitive .
MUMFORD: It was Henry Follett .
LILY: Man , you see him a lot . And it 's very wrong to reveal it . Next you 'll e saying what his problem is .
MUMFORD: What do you want to know ?
LILY: You 're terrible . I 'm never telling you anything . A Patron passes on the way out .
PATRON: Hey , Doc how 's it going ?
MUMFORD: Fine , Vincent how 's yourself ?
LILY: How long you been in this town ?
MUMFORD: Oh , I do n't know
LILY: Four months , two and a half weeks that 's how long . And you 've already got more patients than those other two shrinks combined .
MUMFORD: Lily , I do n't think even you could know that Lily sees something out the window .
LILY: Look at that guy
MUMFORD: Oh , so that 's him ? The Panda Man .
LILY: So , what makes you so popular ? What 's your secret ?
MUMFORD: You like me . How come ?
LILY: Not sure . Let me think about it .
LIONEL: That 's the new psychiatrist ?
LILY: Psychologist . He 's not medical .
LIONEL: Probably thinks he 's pretty smart . Lily gives him a look as she takes his money .
NESSA: so he already had the tattoo that said , `` Naomi Forever '' and now they 're broken up , see , and he has to have it removed . But while the scar is still healing , or whateve you call it when you have a tattoo emoved , he meets Chandra . And it 's serious , immediate love . So in no time , he 's gone from the most gorgeous model in the world to the most gorgeous actress in North America .
MUMFORD: What do you mean , `` in no time '' ?
NESSA: In maybe three or four issues .
MUMFORD: Weekly or monthly ?
NESSA: Monthly ! God , how shallow do you think Brad is ? Why do I waste my time telling you this stuff ?
MUMFORD: Why do you think you tell me , Nessa ?
NESSA: Do n't do that thing that shrink thing .
MUMFORD: It 's a big part of the show .
NESSA: You really need to let people smoke in here , you know . It 's perverse . What are they paying you to see me ? Mumford indicates `` nothing '' .
MUMFORD: It 's called pro bono .
NESSA: Pro boner ? Pro bono , huh ? For whose good , supposedly ?
MUMFORD: It 's my bit for the community .
NESSA: Fuck the community . There was this article my friends and I read . It was `` 25 Signs He 's Great in Bed '' . It was very fascinating .
MUMFORD: Where was this ?
NESSA: Where ? The New York Times . The first one was `` he handles produce well . '' Which we already knew ! The point is , you have a lot of the signs .
MUMFORD: You been spying on me in the supermarket , Nessa ?
NESSA: Have women found you attractive ? Mumford laughs .
MUMFORD: That 's not quite what I said
NESSA: It 's a really weird thing for a shrink to say and then you said maybe people 'd be happier if they 'd accept that some things do n't change that it 'd be some kind of a relief or something Mumford waits .
SKIP: Hi .
MUMFORD: How are you ?
SKIP: Fine . Okay . Pretty good . I 've been hoping we 'd meet . I 've heard a lot about you .
MUMFORD: No kidding Panda . Where 'd that come from ?
SKIP: Panda ? I 've always liked giant pandas I 've been to China and seen them in the wild . That 's the kind of thing I can do if I want now . I can do pretty much anything I want to do these days .
MUMFORD: Nah scotch .
SKIP: Far out . Single malt ? Can I pick it ?
MUMFORD: You want me to be your friend .
SKIP: Of course ! That 's exactly what I want .
MUMFORD: Have you thought about getting a wife ?
SKIP: When Panda started to happen , I was dating women from New York , San Francisco , L.A . They came out of the woodwork . Models , actresses , venture capitalists These were not the kind of girls who were interested in me before I hit it And you know what I discovered ? I discovered these girls did not love me for myself . The majority of them did n't even like me . But a lot of them would 've gladly become Mrs. Skipperton for a while . Can you imagine that marrying someone just because they 've got money ? Mumford considers that .
MUMFORD: Is that the question ?
SKIP: You moved here from back East and your name is the same as this town . Is that right ? Far out .
MUMFORD: I understand .
SKIP: I have a lot of money . Do you know how much money I 've got ?
MUMFORD: Do n't tell me , 'cause I 'm not going to tell you what I 've got .
SKIP: I 've got three big ones .
MUMFORD: I 'm impressed . I could n't make three million dollars if I lived three lifetimes .
SKIP: No , no I have three billion dollars .
LIONEL: so I 'm watching Brokaw and they 've got some astronomer , this little limey know-it-all , and he 's telling how , with this Himball telescope , they 've discovered there are maybe 400 million more galaxies than they thought there were . And I guess that 's supposed to make me feel small ? I 'm supposed to feel insignificant ? Is that the point ? Because I can tell you it did n't . Mumfords eyes dart to look at THE CLOCK on the bookshelf 2 23
MUMFORD: Lionel , since this is our first session together , maybe
LIONEL: Kind of impatient for a big-time headshrinker , are n't you ? How 'bout you let me explain it my own way
MUMFORD: Sure I can , Lionel .
LIONEL: I 'm a criminal lawyer you think I like my clients ? I ca n't stand most of them ! But I do n't kick them out
MUMFORD: See that sign We retain the right to refuse service to anyone . I 'm not going to charge you for this session , ut I do n't want to see you back here .
LIONEL: Do n't you at least have a back doo I can use ?
MUMFORD: Come out this way . There 's no shame in getting a little therapy is there , Althea ?
ALTHEA: Not at all . It takes guts , Lionel . Lionel steams by them in a black mood .
LIONEL: Maybe some of us do n't need this crap !
MUMFORD: And it 's the Hubble Telescope , not the Himball Telescope .
ALTHEA: What do they want from me ? What have I done that 's so wrong ? They act as though they do n't have their own peculiar things They do ! Believe me . Everybody 's got something Even you probably have things .
MUMFORD: Me more than most .
ALTHEA: Why are they ganging up against me ?
MUMFORD: I 'm not sure . But I think they 're worried about you .
ALTHEA: It 's the kids , you know , not Jeremy . He had nothing to do with this except pay , of course . He 's always willing to pay . He 's extremely generous . I 'm so humiliated that my own children would threaten me .
MUMFORD: How did they threaten you ?
ALTHEA: They said if I did n't get help , they would n't deal with me any more . What do you think about that ?
MUMFORD: Good kids .
ALTHEA: Mmmmfffstttubll abbittmm .
MUMFORD: Hmm ?
ALTHEA: I said you must come out to the house for dinner on Thursday .
MUMFORD: Really ? You think so ?
ALTHEA: Yes . Jeremy will be home for the weekend . And you can meet the kids . Mumford considers , then nods his assent .
MUMFORD: How ya doin ' , Ainge ? Evenin ' , Lily .
LILY: Doc . Ainge
COOK: Dr. Mumford .
MUMFORD: Mr. Cook .
COOK: Could you come with me please ?
MUMFORD: Uh-huh .
COOK: It 's my daughter Sofie she 's got ta problem .
MUMFORD: What 's that ?
COOK: We 're not sure . She 's been to all kinds of doctors in the city and they 've said different things . Some of 'em are callin ' it Epstein-Barr virus , and the rest are callin ' it Chronic Fatigue Symptom
MUMFORD: Syndrome Chronic Fatigue Syndrome .
COOK: That 's it syndrome . So you know all about it ?
MUMFORD: No a little . There 's a lot of debate about it .
COOK: Yeah , I got that . Some people think it 's all in their heads . It 's been so bad she 's had to move ack here to Mumford and live with us . And I 'm not sure that 's the best thing , either
MUMFORD: Why 's that ?
COOK: Oh a lot of things . Several different factors . Will you see her , Doctor Mumford ?
MUMFORD: Sure . Why do n't you bring her up to my office at 3 tomorrow afternoon . Cook nods , but looks worried .
COOK: I 'm not sure she 'll come . She 's in a mood . Do you ever go to somebody 's house ?
MUMFORD: Generally that does n't work out so well . It sends the wrong message to people who need to make a change .
LIONEL: You 've got to have the right ladde for the job . You do n't know what you 're doing , you can get yourself in trouble .
MUMFORD: You 're right , as usual . See you .
SHEELER: practices .
LIONEL: Whatever . Six months ago , you two were the only games in town . The value of your `` practices '' could be seriously undermined by this bozo . A town this size has only so many headcases to go around .
DELBANCO: What exactly would you have us do , Lionel ?
LIONEL: Protect your turf ! Check this guy out . I smell a rat , I tell you .
SHEELER: Mr. Dillard , I 'm sure Dr. Delbanco shares my gratitude for your concern . But I also know he 'd agree that you misunderstand the nature of ou calling to mental health . We 're not in some widget business , trying to crush our competition .
LIONEL: What the hell 's a widget ?
DELBANCO: What an asshole !
SHEELER: Ernest , what do you think ?
DELBANCO: I think he 's got a point . So does she .
SKIP: This is great !
MUMFORD: Skip , you must have lots of people you can throw a ball with .
SKIP: You 'd be surprised . Most guys have kids or wives or girlfriends . They 're usy . It 's not as easy as you think .
MUMFORD: Skip , you 're the head of the whole deal here . Are they busier than you ?
SKIP: Well , you know that 's the thing . Like I said , just about everybody in town works for me . And it 's just not the same asking someone to throw a all when they work for you . It 's like an order or something And no one no one asks me . Mumford considers . SLAP SLAP SLAP .
MUMFORD: So , would you say we 're out here let me think how to put this Is your problem really that you 're lonely ?
SKIP: Do n't you like this ?
MUMFORD: Hell yes , I like it . What 's bette than this ? Most guys would kill just to have someone do this with them whenever they like .
SKIP: Okay then .
SLAP... SLAP: Have you got a lot of friends ?
MUMFORD: Lily and I talk a bit . You know Lily , uns the coffee shop ?
SKIP: No I 've seen her . Good-looking woman .
MUMFORD: She 's probably ten years older than you .
SLAP... SLAP: Good-looking woman .
MUMFORD: Lives downstairs from me . She 's got a great dog named for Danny Ainge .
SKIP: Really ? I 'm the only person I know that likes Danny Ainge , outside of Celtic fans . Maybe Phoenix .
MUMFORD: Well , there 's Lily .
SKIP: Did you know that Danny Ainge was drafted by the Blue Jays ? Do you know what kind of athlete you have to be to play in the NBA and in the igs ?
MUMFORD: Amazing .
SKIP: Unbelievable
SLAP... SLAP: And Lily named her dog after him ? Far out .
MUMFORD: What kind of person do you have to e to do this ?
SKIP: What ?
MUMFORD: This
SKIP: I would 've traded any of it to have made the Mumford High varsity . Mumford takes that in . SLAP SLAP .
MUMFORD: Yeah .
SLAP... SLAP: Guy 's got some serious sex fantasies .
MUMFORD: Pretty good , too . Lots of detail . Nothing hard core . Old-fashioned ones , from back when people cared about atmosphere and character .
SKIP: Uh-huh .
MUMFORD: Problem is , his fantasy life 's a lot etter than his real one . Nothing can live up to it . His wife got sick of it and left him . Took his kids with her .
SKIP: I wondered what happened to her
MUMFORD: Of course , it 's not that simple . There 's something powerful going on there . We 've got a lot of work to do . It 's hit to the warning track !
SOFIE: I 'd better not , I 'll fall right to sleep . I think it 's too soon for me to be sleeping with you . A joke . Mumford smiles .
MUMFORD: What can you tell me about this ?
SOFIE: Oh , lord . It 's almost too exhausting to tell you about my exhaustion . I did n't eally want to come . I 'm not hopeful ight now . But I could n't take the look on my dad 's face . He 's a truly kind person , which is pretty extraordinary if you knew the story . He 's the opposite of me , I guess all stamina and resolve .
MUMFORD: When did you start to feel this way ?
SOFIE: About six months ago , I guess it is now . God , it seems like years . What a bore ! I 'm embarrassed by it . Before this happened when I 'd hear people talk about this kind of thing I thought it was a bunch of bullshit .
MUMFORD: What ?
SOFIE: You think that now ! You think it 's a unch of hooey , do n't you ?
MUMFORD: No .
SOFIE: I saw it . I saw it in your eyes .
MUMFORD: Back when this started , was there anything unusual happening in you life ? A change of job , of living situation a loss of some kind ?
SOFIE: No but it started one year to the day after my divorce became final . That 's not too suspicious , is it ? But it was n't like I was feeling bad about the divorce . Just the opposite .
MUMFORD: Hmm .
SOFIE: Hmm ? Is that a professional opinion ?
MUMFORD: Hmm , as in that 's interesting . Sometimes , with enough clues , it 's possible to figure these things out .
SOFIE: Even if you do n't think it 's real ?
MUMFORD: I do n't know what 's real and what is n't . That 's never been my strong suit . But if you 're tired all the time and you 've had to give up the life you were having and come back home when you did n't want to that 's worth trying to fix . Maybe I can help you do that .
SOFIE: What would you do ?
MUMFORD: We we would try several things . But I need to see you a lot .
SOFIE: I do n't know . I barely made it today .
MUMFORD: I 'll come to you . We 'll try a little walking . Sofie suddenly looks defeated .
SOFIE: I do n't think I can afford it . I do n't want my dad paying .
MUMFORD: We 'll work it out . Sofie gives him a long look .
SOFIE: You have the best answer fo everything . You seem so hopeful . Are you always this sunny ?
MUMFORD: No one ever thought so . You must ing it out .
SOFIE: Is it contagious ? 'Cause everyone agrees my immune system 's way down .
MUMFORD: Maybe you 'll catch it .
SOFIE: Can I ask you something ? Did n't you tell my dad you did n't think it was a good idea to come to the patient ? So what changed ?
ALTHEA: sorry everything 's in such an uproar . Lots of big occasions coming up , and of course Christmas is only eight months away I do n't know what 's keeping Jeremy . You know he stays in the city three nights a week I guess I explained that I know Katie 's here , but I 'm not so sure about Martin I 'm making dinner myself tonight , so I 'll have to leave you , I 'm afraid
MUMFORD: You must be Katie . People call me Doc .
KATIE: C'mere . Quick c'mon !
MARTIN: Is this him ?
KATIE: I showed him .
MARTIN: Do you get it now ? This is no joke .
JEREMY: Hey , kids . Oh , hi .
MUMFORD: Doc . Nice to meet you .
JEREMY: Sorry I 'm late traffic was a motherfucker . Have another drink , I 'll be back in five .
ALTHEA: I 'll be back .
JEREMY: I think you 'll like this . Know much about Cuban cigars ?
MUMFORD: Nope .
JEREMY: Makes the whole thing that much etter .
MUMFORD: I 've had my moments .
JEREMY: I am . And I 'm not ashamed of it . Nobody ever said on their death bed `` I treated myself too well . ''
MUMFORD: I thought it was Nobody ever said , `` I should have spent more time at the office . ''
JEREMY: Fill in the blank . I do n't mind the office . The point is , you only go 'round once . Like the Zens say Be here now .
MUMFORD: What do you do ?
JEREMY: Althea has n't told you ?
MUMFORD: We 've been talking about her , mostly .
JEREMY: Well , in '85 four of us left ou firms and formed an investment banking venture . We 've got twenty-three people working there now .
MUMFORD: You 've done well .
JEREMY: We 've done very well . You know anything about addiction , Doc ?
MUMFORD: A little .
JEREMY: Well , I 'm addicted to winning . I say when you 're in the red zone , you got ta score . So what do you think ?
MUMFORD: Tastes good .
JEREMY: No I mean about Althea . About her behavior . Do you think you can fix her up ?
MUMFORD: What do you think 's wrong with her ?
JEREMY: She 's gone weird is what 's wrong with her . Out of control . Probably from living out here in Mayberry .
MUMFORD: She seems very unhappy . Jeremy gives him a look , as if to say `` duh . ''
JEREMY: I think we all knew that , professor . The question the real quest-tio-nee is why ? Mumford looks at him a long time .
MARTIN: But you know how to drive ?
MUMFORD: Sure .
MARTIN: Got a license ? But no car ?
MUMFORD: Do n't need it .
MARTIN: I just got my license two weeks ago .
MUMFORD: You 're good .
MARTIN: I been drivin ' since I was twelve .
MUMFORD: That would explain it .
MARTIN: Can you help Mom ?
MUMFORD: I 'm trying .
MARTIN: Got to . They drive in silence for a bit . Then
MUMFORD: Is she a friend of yours ?
MARTIN: No sort of . Man , she could be cool , but all she does is get wrecked and do all the guys . She 's blowin ' them in the parking lot . Mumford knew that .
LILY: Ainge !
MARTIN: That 's okay . Jeremy wo n't mind . Good dog .
LILY: Ainge !
MUMFORD: It 's a pretty piece of land . They walk up the block with the dog .
LILY: And the Brocketts ?
MUMFORD: Horror show . What 'd you do tonight ?
LILY: It was insane here , man . 'Hadda call in the National Guard . Then I did my laundry watched
MUMFORD: And ?
LILY: Shocking . Did you know the government is wasteful ? You heard it here first . Oh , and eing a supermodel it 's no walk in the park .
MUMFORD: Why do you watch ?
LILY: No gentleman caller , Doc . Not that I care . I 've had it with men . They 're so fascinated by thei own crap . Took me four years to get the last one out . Almost turned me into a dyke These days my idea of a hot date is a long shower by myself efore bed . Now that feels good . And you do n't have to do all that listening . Mumford laughs .
SOFIE: I 'm not making any promises .
MUMFORD: We 'll turn back anytime you want .
SOFIE: Oh boy this should be interesting .
MRS. COOK: Mumford like the town ?
MUMFORD: Yes . It 's nice to meet you , Mrs. Cook .
MRS. COOK: What 's happening here ?
SOFIE: We 're going for a walk .
MRS. COOK: Do you think that 's a good idea ?
SOFIE: Dr. Mumford does , yes . I 've put myself completely in his hands . For today , anyway .
MRS. COOK: What kind of doctor are you ?
MUMFORD: Ph.D. , psychologist .
MRS. COOK: Oh not a real doctor .
MUMFORD: That 's right , the fake kind .
SOFIE: We 'd better go or I 'm liable to bail on the whole thing .
MUMFORD: People usually have to get to know me before they hate me .
SOFIE: She 's not in a bad mood . She 's like that all the time . It does n't bother me anymore . It 's my dad and my brother I worry about .
MUMFORD: Maybe but you 're the one whose ass is dragging .
SOFIE: Is that the technical description of what I 've got ?
MUMFORD: Is she against you getting help ?
SOFIE: We do n't discuss it .
MUMFORD: Something 's bothering her .
SOFIE: Oh , we 've all disappointed her . Me , especially , but Dad , of course . She thinks my brother 's all right , but she did n't expect much . It 's what happens when you `` marry beneath yourself '' Sofie suddenly seems to be fading .
MUMFORD: Please forgive me .
SOFIE: What ?
MUMFORD: Negative thinking makes everything more difficult . If you 're going to have enough strength to do this , we have to talk only about positive things . All right ?
SOFIE: You 've got a funny idea of funny .
MUMFORD: I 've offended you !
SOFIE: No .
MUMFORD: Really ? What would it take ?
SOFIE: Is this the treatment ?
MUMFORD: Sorry I 'm done .
SOFIE: 'Cause I 'll tell you , none of the others have tried this approach .
MUMFORD: Be specific .
SOFIE: Well I 'm tired all the time , obviously . I always feel like taking a nap . But when I try to sleep , I have trouble . My muscles ache . And my joints . I feel like an old person , or like I did back when I used to work out too hard What else ?
MUMFORD: Painful lymph glands ? Forget fulness irritability depression ?
SOFIE: Yes , yes , and definitely yes . Also I get confused .
MUMFORD: Yeah , most people have that . It 's confusing here .
SOFIE: Where ?
MUMFORD: Life .
SOFIE: I do n't know if I mentioned the headaches .
MUMFORD: Did you get headaches before this ? But you get more now ? Or more severe ?
SOFIE: No , not really . They 're about the same . My marriage was one long headache .
MUMFORD: So the headaches may not even be a part of this ? She considers that , reluctantly agrees .
SOFIE: Is that like a party trick ?
MUMFORD: All I have to do is have two conflicting thoughts at the same time Like I 'll think 'Taking these walks is going to help Sofie get better . ' But then I 'll also think 'Mumford , you just enjoy taking these walks and you 're kidding yourself about the benefits . '
SOFIE: You actually address yourself by name in your thoughts ? So you really think having two opposing ideas in your head does some kind of damage ?
MUMFORD: Sometimes , yeah pulling in two different directions at once . It makes tiny little tears in our fabric .
SOFIE: Well then , my life has been some kind of huge rip .
LANDLADY'S DAUGHTER: get off my case ! You do n't like any of my friends
FOLLETT: What ?
MUMFORD: Stop now .
FOLLETT: Why ? I 'm paying for this .
MUMFORD: Not for this . Not me , you 're not .
FOLLETT: You find it distasteful , do n't you ?
MUMFORD: It does n't matter how I feel about it . It 's how you feel about it that matters .
FOLLETT: I enjoy it . Does that make me some kind of pervert ? Just because a man has a rich imaginative life
MUMFORD: You did n't come to me because you have a rich imagination .
FOLLETT: No ?
MUMFORD: You came because it 's taking over . You 're in its grip .
FOLLETT: I never said that .
MUMFORD: Where 's your wife , Henry ?
FOLLETT: Go to hell .
MUMFORD: I did n't hear you .
FOLLETT: We got divorced . I had to get rid of her . She could n't satisfy me .
MUMFORD: What ? !
FOLLETT: I was never satisfied .
MUMFORD: Now we 're back on track .
FOLLETT: You are so mean .
MUMFORD: Hey , Skip .
SKIP: Doc . I know we 're not supposed to get together till Wednesday
MUMFORD: That 's all right . What 's on you mind ?
SKIP: How many sessions have we had now , Doc ? Six . And it 's been good like we were two buddies hanging out . Just shootin ' the shit .
MUMFORD: Yep . They walk in silence for a while .
SKIP: This is really hard . Everything I want to say is hard
MUMFORD: Sometimes it 's best to keep a few things just for ourselves .
SKIP: You 're a shrink , Doc . Are n't I supposed to be able to tell you everything ?
MUMFORD: It 's just a thought .
SKIP: That really relates to the thing I want to ask you I 've noticed that sometimes , not a lot , but sometimes , when we 're hanging out , throwin ' the all or that time we went owling sometimes you 'll like tell me things about your othe patients .
MUMFORD: You 're concerned that maybe I ca n't e trusted with a secret .
SKIP: I trust you . Definitely . No question . But , yeah , I 'm a little concerned . I mean , you 're not supposed to tell anyone about your patients ' problems are you ? Mumford looks at Skip for a long moment .
MUMFORD: That is correct , Skip . I 'm going to have to take a long look at that .
SKIP: Yeah , well what I was gon na tell you
MUMFORD: Skip . Knowing what you do about me
SKIP: Doc , I trust you ! You 've listened to me better than anybody maybe ever . And this secret I 've got , I ca n't stand it anymore . I do n't know if I 'm some kind of
MUMFORD: You are Panda , monarch of modems .
SKIP: That 's right . And you also know that even though I make 23 % of the modems in the world I can not make one simple connection with any woman who could truly love me .
MUMFORD: Okay let 's say that , for now .
SKIP: It 's true , believe me . So do you know what I 've been doing , all alone , in my workshop , for almost two years ? Mr. Find-the-Need-and-Fill- It . How I spend my every solitary hour ? Mumford shakes his head , `` no . ''
MUMFORD: Jerking off ?
SKIP: No ! Although that 's a good guess . No , what I 've been working on , what the world really needs and no one has been able to create a virtually life-like , humanoid , gender-specific , anatomically functional sexual surrogate slash companion .
MUMFORD: Slash what ?
SKIP: Sexual surrogate slash companion .
MUMFORD: A doll ?
SKIP: No , Doc , not a doll . I am Panda . I 'm talking about much , much more than a doll . The world has never seen what I 'm talking about except maybe in the movies .
MUMFORD: How 's it coming ?
SKIP: You do n't think I 'm insane ?
MUMFORD: And that 's your secret ? You meant like a trade secret ?
SKIP: No , Doc , a private secret ! It 's perverted , it 's pitiful . What am I Dr. Frankenstein ? Are n't you repulsed ?
MUMFORD: Sounds like kind of a good idea .
SKIP: Really ?
MUMFORD: Definitely .
SKIP: It 's not ?
MUMFORD: Oh , it 's okay . It 's just not something to be ashamed of . Maybe you do n't want people knowing and believe me , it 's safe with me but on the scale of dirty little secrets , I 'd give it , say a two .
SKIP: Who else knows ?
MUMFORD: Just you .
SKIP: It 's time you did some talkin ' , Dr. Mum Wait a minute . That is you name , is n't it ? Mumford takes a drink of beer .
MUMFORD: Does n't matter . You can call me Doc .
SKIP: It matters to me . Mumford gestures `` sorry , no can do . ''
MUMFORD: I can tell you anything else .
SKIP: What about everything ? How did this happen ?
MUMFORD: Did you know that every species of mammal has found some way to drug , inebriate , or anestnetize itself ? Even if it 's just banging its head against a rock . Seems to be some natural urge to get away for a while . I 've had it for as long as I can emember . The first place I wanted out of was home
MUMFORD: pizza delivery , pipe fitting , pest control lots of jobs that started with the letter `` p '' . Fo some reason , I kept losing these jobs . The only mind-altering substance I never had a problem with was alcohol . I never got drunk . I did n't like the feeling . But really , when you 're as fucked up as I was big deal .
SKIP: an investigator for the Internal Revenue Service ?
MUMFORD: Everybody has a story , Skip .
SKIP: Sounds like you have several .
MUMFORD: What it felt like was a series of separate , unconnected lives hillbilly kid , wrecked college boy , garbage man , civil service guy et cetera et cetera . Every time I 'd leave a life , it felt good . Whatever problems I was having were suddenly gone . I had no friends and I did n't talk to my family . The only constant , stabilizing force in my life was drugs .
SKIP: An IRS investigator with a drug problem ?
MUMFORD: It was n't the best situation .
SKIP: Did you carry a gun ?
MUMFORD: Did n't need one . We did n't even need a warrant for most of the shit we did . Man , the IRS we could go in your bank account , your credit cards hell , we used to go into doctors ' files and get all the juicy details . Nobody wants to argue with the IRS .
SKIP: You were messed up , man .
MUMFORD: But look at me now
SKIP: Hey , you 've done good . Look at yourself you 've cleaned up , you 've got a career
MUMFORD: Things got a lot worse .
SKIP: You and Candy ?
SKIP: And so you did Mumford nods .
MUMFORD: Harder than I thought . Took me three tries . But I was highly motivated figured there was no point in leaving me and taking that along . After two omb-outs , I found a place in the desert
SKIP: Somebody 's taking a shower down there .
MUMFORD: That 'd be Lily .
SKIP: I wish I could live in the shower . I 'd take five a day if I had the time . I went to this spa in Germany , a sanitarium practically , up on this mountain . And the great thing they just kept you wet all day .
MUMFORD: Who 'd you go with ? That 's not good .
SKIP: How 'd you do it ? The new you .
MUMFORD: You know how easy it is . A kid can manage it if he wants a fake I.D . You can do practically the whole deal at your local Kinko 's . The only variable is how much pride you take in the product .
SKIP: I know it starts with a birth certificate
MUMFORD: All new people start with that
SKIP: `` Mumford '' I mean , why pick the name of the town you were going to ?
MUMFORD: Oh . You got it backwards . I already had the name when I started looking for somewhere to settle . When I saw this town on a map , I thought maybe it was a sign . See
SKIP: But you studied psychology , right ? You did the training and just neve got the degree ?
MUMFORD: No no training .
SKIP: Psych major ?
MUMFORD: English Lit .
SKIP: Jeez , man . But you 're good at it !
MUMFORD: I understand what it 's like to want to leave a problem behind . That 's all most people are looking to do . Mainly , I listen . He heads inside .
SKIP: Where ya going ? I 've got a million questions .
MUMFORD: See you Thursday regular time .
SOFIE: so we get on this incredible steam engine train that runs up into the mountains and this trip is everything it 's cracked up to be an open car , great views , the mountain air blowing through . We 're sitting there , married for six years , and he says how he likes it better when I put my hai ack
MUMFORD: You 're doing great .
SOFIE: I do n't know if I 'm going to make it the whole way .
MUMFORD: It does n't matter . Go on .
SOFIE: Oh this makes me sound irrational , which is probably right , but there was something about him saying this it was maybe the millionth time he 'd told me about some preference of his . Well , I was so tired of it . Seems like my whole life someone 's een telling me I 'm just not getting it right . Can we rest for a second ?
MUMFORD: Yes .
SOFIE: who thinks there 's nothing really wrong with me .
MUMFORD: Oh , there 's something wrong with you , all right . Especially afte hearing that dream of yours , about the Roto-Rooter . She laughs . They 're playing with each other .
SOFIE: That was really bad , was n't it ?
MUMFORD: Disgusting .
SOFIE: And I 'll bet you can interpret the whole thing
MUMFORD: It 's pretty obvious to a trained professional .
SOFIE: I hate those dreams where everything means something .
MUMFORD: Is that when you split up ?
SOFIE: No , that 'd be a good story , but that was just the beginning of the end . We went on for another year or so .
MUMFORD: Brady Peck 's . Fourteen years old . Lives next door .
SOFIE: And he 's where ?
MUMFORD: In the capitol for Boy 's Nation . Five days . Why ?
SOFIE: I 'm thinking a gal could make a good living doing this . How hard could it e squeezing out some fourteen yea old ?
MUMFORD: You like it ?
SOFIE: It 's all right .
MUMFORD: Then you can expect me at 5 30 tomorrow morning .
SOFIE: And this is legitimate therapy ?
MUMFORD: Therapy ? Hell no , I just do n't want to do it alone .
NESSA: What are you doing ? We 're not done . I just need to find the thing
MUMFORD: If you do n't want to have a session today , it 's okay .
NESSA: I want to have the session . I thought it would be cool if I could show you some of the things that interest me . But I guess you 're not into it which we already knew .
MUMFORD: What happened today ?
NESSA: What are you talking about ?
MUMFORD: Was it something that happened at school ?
NESSA: These appointments were not my idea , emember .
MUMFORD: True . Should we stop them ?
NESSA: I do n't think you know what you 're talking about .
MUMFORD: Uh-huh .
NESSA: This shrink school you went to did you hear about it on an infomercial ?
MUMFORD: Do you think that 's what he wants ?
NESSA: No . I do n't know what he wants . But I know I do n't like being watched . Nobody 's ever paid any attention to what I did , and I liked it just fine . Where does he get off telling me I disrespect myself ? Fuck him . Look in a mirror , bozo .
MUMFORD: What 's the deal ?
LILY: They come through a few times each year . Hello , Mrs. Saito , good to see you again ! It 's a tour .
MUMFORD: Where am I supposed to eat ?
LILY: You 're on your own today , honey .
SKIP: Doc .
MUMFORD: Lily , I want you to meet Skip . Skip , Lily .
LILY: It 's a pleasure to meet you .
SKIP: Yeah me you , too I was at you house
LILY: Oh ?
SKIP: Upstairs , with Doc Yeah , it 's very nice I heard your shower .
LILY: I 've seen you going by on your board , ut I did n't realize you 're so young to be so
SKIP: What ?
MUMFORD: so rich ?
LILY: so accomplished .
SKIP: I may be young , but Doc can tell you , I 'm very immature .
LILY: I 'd better get in there .
SKIP: That 's a lot of people all at once .
LILY: It 's okay . They pre-order . There 's a choice of three entrees .
SKIP: What are they ?
LILY: Meat loaf , turkey quesadillas , o salad nicoise .
SKIP: Salad nicoise ? I love salad nicoise .
LILY: You do ?
SKIP: Yeah .
LILY: Well , come on in .
MUMFORD: Dr. Delbanco . It 's nice to see you again .
DELBANCO: I do n't think you know Dr. Sheeler . She 's the other therapist here in town .
MUMFORD: Of course I 've heard great things about you .
SHEELER: Thank you .
DELBANCO: You never got back to me . I called to say we 'd like to take you out for a meal ? Kind of a professional welcome . Mumford makes a show of remembering .
MUMFORD: Forgive me , please . What a gracious thought . We must do that .
SHEELER: When ?
MUMFORD: Why do n't I call you when I 've got my calendar in front of me ?
DELBANCO: What are you doing for lunch ?
MUMFORD: Right now ?
DELBANCO: annihilation anxieties engendered y bad experiences with a depriving mother but no one can escape the fear of death . It is , as Henry James put it , `` the worm at the core . '' Try as we may to forget or ignore ou mortality , James said `` the skull will grin in at the anquet . ''
MUMFORD: Are we ?
SHEELER: What Ernest means , I think , is we 're very interested in othe methodology different kinds of training . We 're great believers in learning from each other . I 've learned so much from Ern Dr. Delbanco
DELBANCO: And I from Phyllis .
SHEELER: So the University of Kentucky . Who runs the program down there ?
MUMFORD: My mentor was an amazing teache named Benton Mandlebaum . Died quite tragically in the collapse of a gazebo .
DELBANCO: I think I 've heard of him a disciple of Rothberg , was n't he ?
MUMFORD: It 's possible . I do n't know about that .
SHEELER: I suppose your extended training was at an institution in that area ?
MUMFORD: Lots of institutions . My graduate advisor believed we should experience as many environments as possible prisons , clinics , half-way houses . For a while I was chief therapist in a shopping mall . Had a little spot next to the yogurt place .
DELBANCO: Interesting approach . What was his name ?
MUMFORD: Dorothy Fowler . Fantastic woman . She passed last year in a train wreck . Damned Amtrak .
SHEELER: I trained in the east , myself Cornell and I do n't care what anyone says , there really are regional differences . I found the state certification exams out here quite harrowing Did you ?
MUMFORD: Oh , yeah , very tough . But I guess that 's good to keep out the quacks .
SHEELER: Which examiner did you have ? I probably know him .
MUMFORD: Wallace Franklin from Greensburg .
SHEELER: That was a terrible thing .
MUMFORD: I do n't even know why hang-gliding is considered a legitimate sport .
DELBANCO: We 're interested in any new therapies . How would you characterize you approach ?
MUMFORD: My approach ?
SHEELER: Yes your particular approach .
MUMFORD: I do n't have one really . Most of the time I 'm faking it . See , I think there 's not much that can be done about most problems they 're too complicated , too deep-rooted by the time I hear about them . The most I can do , usually , is look and listen eal closely , try to catch some glimpse of the secret life everybody 's got . If I can get a sense of that , well then , maybe just maybe , I can help them out a little .
DELBANCO: I see .
ALTHEA: The argument had nothing to do with it .
MUMFORD: You must have been concerned .
ALTHEA: It 's happened before . I 'm shocked by how little I 'm feeling . I ca n't understand it . I 'll probably have a complete depressoid collapse soon , wo n't I ?
MUMFORD: Doubtful . What did he say ?
ALTHEA: He said he was n't coming back . He said it was n't working for him any more . That it had n't `` worked fo him '' for quite a while You know what I regret the most ? I 'm sorry I let him make the kids take his name . He was an acquirer . He liked to acquire things .
MUMFORD: Take your time .
ALTHEA: When I was in high school , the thing I wanted most , when I was stuck in class , the thing I was always desperately in pursuit of was a hall pass . That 's all I wanted . I loved moving freely around the school while everybody else was trapped in there And that 's how I feel right now Like I have some giant , all- day hall pass .
MUMFORD: You can go out there if you like
ALTHEA: `` There 's no shame in getting a little therapy '' , right , Doc ?
MUMFORD: Henry
SKIP: Thanks , Jennifer , I 'll take him from here .
MUMFORD: I 'm honored .
SKIP: Doc , there 's something about what you told me the other night I ca n't get out of my head . It 's driving me atty Why me ? How did you know you could trust me ?
MUMFORD: You 're completely reliable .
SKIP: It 's just me , Dino ! The old man nods , barely awake .
MUMFORD: Skip , I 've got a problem and I need some advice .
SKIP: You want my advice ? Far out !
MUMFORD: Skip , you 're a visionary . That can e a burden .
SKIP: This does n't seem a little perverse ?
MUMFORD: There are a lot of lonely people in the world . Somebody 's gon na figure this out someday .
SKIP: It 's not going to be me . I 'm giving it up .
MUMFORD: Really ?
SKIP: It 's all your fault . In the last 48 hours , I 've completely lost interest .
MUMFORD: What 'd I do ?
SKIP: Lily .
MUMFORD: Lily Skip , that 's great ! You and Lily .
SKIP: Oh , she does n't know about it yet . Right now , of the two of us , I 'm the only one in love . But I 'm very stoked .
MUMFORD: Wow .
SKIP: I 'm here for you , Doc .
MUMFORD: Skip , you know that it 's improper completely unethical for a licensed psychologist to carry on a romantic elationship with one of his patients ?
SKIP: I guess that makes sense .
MUMFORD: Yes , yes it does
SKIP: You 've fallen in love with one of your patients ?
MUMFORD: What ? Mumford understands and ca n't stop a laugh .
SKIP: Doc , what about this ? You 're not eally a licensed psychologist !
MUMFORD: Yep .
LIONEL: Do n't you find it incredibly convenient that everyone who could possibly corroborate his story has ecently died some exotic death ?
DELBANCO: They 're neither all recent nor exotic .
SHEELER: But they 're certainly dead . And yes , personally , I find it a bit odd .
DELBANCO: It could happen . What about his state certification exams ? The records seem to be in order .
LIONEL: What 's easier than hacking your way into a state computer and inserting some numbers ? For all you know he never even took the exams !
SHEELER: That 's true .
DELBANCO: I do n't know that it 's all that easy
LIONEL: Doctor , correct me if I 'm wrong , but it sounds to me like you 've gone fo this guy 's story hook , line and bull- twaddle .
SHEELER: You do seem much more disposed toward him than I understand , Ernest . Did I miss something ?
DELBANCO: Oh , for god 's sake , Phyllis we have no reason to doubt the man ! Are we listening to Lionel now ?
SHEELER: No , Dr. Delbanco , it is I who am sorry . Sorry to have wasted you time with such
LILY: Stop it ! He 's a kid . I 'm old enough to be his older sister . Mumford smiles , eats .
COOK: Dr. Mumford . Please , come in . Mumford comes in , reluctantly .
MUMFORD: Hello , Mr. Cook . I was wondering if Sofie was around ?
COOK: Were you supposed to have a session ?
MUMFORD: No . It 's sort of spur of the moment .
COOK: Look who 's here . Have you met Sofie 's moth
MRS. COOK: We 've met .
COOK: And our son , Ben
BEN: This is a real honor , Doctor . Have a seat , will ya ? Mumford continues to stand .
MUMFORD: Well , actually , I ca n't really Do you think I could see Sofie ?
BEN: I insist ! I 've been wanting to meet you . Mumford sits .
MRS. COOK: Sofie 's not here .
COOK: Her friend from the city came and took her out to dinner . First time in a long time she 's been willing .
MUMFORD: A friend ?
BEN: We owe that to you . She 's perked up a lot since you started treating her .
MRS. COOK: What 'd you want ?
MUMFORD: There 's something I think we need to talk about .
MRS. COOK: What ?
MR. COOK: Elizabeth
MRS. COOK: I think we have a right .
BEN: We certainly do not .
MRS. COOK: Keep it zipped , Ben .
MR. COOK: Is there something we need to know , Dr. Mumford ?
MUMFORD: Well yes , I guess I should tell you . I do n't think I 'm going to be able to treat Sofie anymore .
MRS. COOK: Finally , some common sense
MUMFORD: What do you mean ?
MRS. COOK: I think you know what I mean .
MUMFORD: No , I really do n't .
MRS. COOK: I think you do .
MUMFORD: Why do n't you tell me ?
MRS. COOK: Why do n't you go to hell ? It 's all a unch of nonsense and you know it .
MR. COOK: Elizabeth , I 'm tellin ' you , stop this
MRS. COOK: You 're telling me ? That 's rich
MUMFORD: I 'd better go .
BEN: Why ca n't you see Sofie ? I know the treatment 's working .
MUMFORD: Well you see , the problem is
MRS. COOK: the problem is you 're a big fake . You have n't got a clue what 's wrong with that girl .
MUMFORD: Wow . You 're something .
MRS. COOK: Take a hike , Dr. Quack !
MR. COOK: What is the problem , Doctor ?
MUMFORD: Problem ? I guess there is no problem Uh , this friend of Sofie 's , where 'd he take her ?
BEN: It 's she Roxy . Used to work with her . I think they went over to The Lantern .
MUMFORD: Oh , Roxy ! Excellent . Roxy .
FOLLETT: What is it ?
MUMFORD: It 's a thought I had .
FOLLETT: Should I open it now ?
MUMFORD: Let me just say something here I have no idea if this is going to help .
FOLLETT: What exactly is it supposed to do ?
MUMFORD: You remember when I asked you about pornography
FOLLETT: I find it degrading . Maximum gynecology and minimum turn-on
MUMFORD: and you told me that . Still , there 's some kind of imagery that 's haunting you and , I think , getting in your way
FOLLETT: Which I do n't necessarily agree .
MUMFORD: But you did come to me .
FOLLETT: And the experiment is in here ?
MUMFORD: You know what ? I think this was a dumb idea He starts to take hold of the box .
FOLLETT: Whoa , whoa , what are you doing ? I want to know what 's in here .
MUMFORD: There 's absolutely no reason to think this is going to have any impact on you . I 'm embarrassed to have
FOLLETT: Hey ! I agree with you that you do n't know what you 're talking about . That 's what I 've been saying all along . And I can guarantee you that looking at the Lost Ark or whatever you got in here is not going to mean diddly to me but if you think I 'm going to let you walk out of here without seeing what 's in this box , you do n't know much about Henry A. Follett .
YOUNG PHARMACIST: It 's her , sir . You told me to get you when she came to pick up he prescription .
FOLLETT: Uh , sorry , I 'm going to have to I really appreciate what you 're trying to uh , I ca n't thank you enough for
MUMFORD: My pleasure .
FOLLETT: I 'll see you on whatever
SOFIE: When I was in high school we used to come up here and make out . I liked to sit on the rock and watch the sun go down .
MUMFORD: That 's what I like .
SOFIE: Which thing ?
MUMFORD: Either one .
SOFIE: Why 'd you come to the house the othe night ?
MUMFORD: I thought I had something to tell you . But it turned out I did n't .
SOFIE: My brother said you were about to fire me .
MUMFORD: That 's one way to put it .
SOFIE: I bet I know what changed your mind My mother . She was so horrible , you decided you could n't desert me .
MUMFORD: I thought only action movies had villains like that . Sofie gestures ahead .
SOFIE: That 's the cut-off , is n't it ? I know why you were going to quit seeing me .
MUMFORD: Yeah ?
SOFIE: I ca n't tell you how much I admire you . You have a wonderful way with people . And you 're very insightful . I feel like you 've seen me clearly I never used to admit what a horrible person my mother was . You 've made that possible for me .
MUMFORD: That 's good ?
SOFIE: Yes ! And my ex-husband he neve accepted me for who I was , just like Mother . The things you 've said have helped me understand what a dick he is .
MUMFORD: I do n't know if
SOFIE: You 're shockingly honest , that 's what makes you great . I 've never had a man treat me this way . With you , I feel really listened to . Can I tell you something ? It 's a little embarrassing , but I feel very unguarded with you .
MUMFORD: Of course .
SOFIE: Thanks to this therapy , I now know what I 'm looking for . I need to find a man like you . Not one who 's treating me , of course . And I 'm going to do it , dammit ! You 've given me the confidence . Mumford is in agony .
MUMFORD: Sofie that makes me very happy .
NESSA: I mean , Doc , the dude is seriously deluded . I said that to him , I said , `` If you think I 'm gon na do all that shit for you , man , you are seriously deluded . ''
MUMFORD: What 'd he say ?
NESSA: He said `` Which we already knew ! '' Mumford laughs , delighted .
MUMFORD: What did he want you to do ?
NESSA: First off , he tells me to stop smoking cigarettes . I told him abso-fuckin'- lutely no . As you can see
MUMFORD: No again ?
NESSA: I said I 'd consider it . Nobody owns me . And the last thing was insane . I do n't know what 's wrong with him No magazines .
MUMFORD: Really ?
NESSA: I do n't know if I can quit . We 're gon na try it together , like , you know , AA or something . And I made him give up his .22 . No more sneaking around the hills with his fucking nut gun like some loony tune .
MUMFORD: He agreed ?
NESSA: He 's pitiful , Doc , a goddam puppy . I do n't know how much longer I can put up with it . I already got two arms and legs , I do n't need anothe appendage .
MARTIN: Hiya , Doc .
MUMFORD: Martin .
MARTIN: Did you straighten her out ?
MUMFORD: How are you ?
MARTIN: Insane ! Did n't ja hear ? My family got five hundred times better . Let 's go , Vanessa .
MUMFORD: I did n't see you there . Can I help you ?
GILROY: My name 's Gilroy . I 'm from the State Certification Board .
MUMFORD: Do you want to come in ?
GILROY: No thanks . Plenty of time for that when we 're a little further along .
MUMFORD: Mr. Gilroy Gilroy stops , outside door already open .
GILROY: I 'm not at liberty to say . Sometimes it 's just routine , sometimes there 's een a complaint . We 'll be in touch .
DELBANCO: and when you said at lunch about everybody having `` a secret life '' , something just snapped inside me . I knew I could no longer continue my elationship with Dr. Sheeler . It was tearing me up inside . And I know Phyllis was n't getting what she needed from it . What had started as a genuine espect , I think , for each other 's professional abilities , and became , over time , a personal attraction had somehow migrated into a rathe torrid sexual relationship
MUMFORD: How do you mean ? This next is painful for Delbanco .
DELBANCO: Well you see , when I broke it off with Phyllis , she was naturally upset and she became more determined than ever to pursue certain how to put it doubts she 's been harboring
MUMFORD: What kind of doubts ?
DELBANCO: About you your background and your qualifications . I 'm afraid Phyllis somehow got you mixed up in her fury with me , and actually took the whole issue to the state board . Mumford digests this .
MUMFORD: I see .
DELBANCO: And please , for whatever small way I may have encouraged this , accept my apologies . There is good news , though .
MUMFORD: What 's that ?
DELBANCO: Phyllis has decided to leave town and pursue her practice in the city . Which leaves you the only psychologist in town .
MUMFORD: Dr. Sheeler is leaving Mumford ? I 'm sorry to hear that .
DELBANCO: As you can imagine , my own feelings about this are mixed Unlike , I must say , those of my wife .
MUMFORD: I 'm very happy for you , Henry .
FOLLETT: Me too , Doc . And I ca n't tell you what that package meant to me
SOFIE: I need to talk to you Doctor . Can I come in ?
MUMFORD: Of course .
SOFIE: We have n't met in this office since that first time . This is how a real professional and his client are supposed to see each other . Mumford waits .
MUMFORD: Is something wrong , Sofie ?
SOFIE: Yes , something 's very wrong , Dr. Mumford .
MUMFORD: You 're upset .
SOFIE: How intuitive ! That must take years of training right there . Maybe you can guess what has upset me .
MUMFORD: Is it something you 've heard about me ?
SOFIE: No , it is not something I 've heard about you ! It is someth Why ? Is there something I should have heard about you ?
MUMFORD: Why do n't you tell me what 's on you mind ?
SOFIE: May I ?
MUMFORD: Um-huh .
SOFIE: First of all , I have been feeling much better lately . I do n't know if the syndrome is over if it 's just un its course or something but I feel a hundred per cent better than when I first came to you .
MUMFORD: I 'm glad .
SOFIE: Given that , I 'm obviously not going to be judging things in the most ealistic way .
MUMFORD: I do n't follow you .
SOFIE: I 'm saying that since I 'm doing so much better which I attribute to you I 'm liable to misinterpret some of my feelings .
MUMFORD: Okay
SOFIE: The point is this I am not a blank page . I did not just fall off the turnip truck . Do you know what I mean ?
MUMFORD: I think so .
SOFIE: I know a little about psychology . I took three different courses in college . It 's true , none of them were above the two hundred level , ut I took them And there was one concept I remember very well .
MUMFORD: What was that ?
SOFIE: Transference !
MUMFORD: Transference .
SOFIE: Yes , and that is what I have got ight now . I have taken my feelings of gratitude and relief and transferred them onto you . I have taken all those warm , grateful emotions and confused them with feelings for you So that now I am under the delusion that I am in love with you .
MUMFORD: Hello .
SOFIE: I think you can understand why I have some serious questions about your methods . I mean , obviously it ecomes much more likely that I 'm going to have confusion about this when your idea of treatment is to go walking in the woods and up to make- outs-ville and do all these highly omantic activities
MUMFORD: Yes .
SOFIE: Maybe you ought to think about how you 're going to fix this . And when you do please get back to me .
MUMFORD: Hey , Ainge .
LILY: Doc
MUMFORD: Lily .
LILY: Doc .
MUMFORD: He told you .
LILY: Skip and I would n't have got togethe if it were n't for you . That 's a big deal .
MUMFORD: You would have met in some showe eventually
LILY: I want to give you something . Will you let me ?
MUMFORD: Thanks , Lily , I do n't need anything .
LILY: Yes , you do , you damn well do .
MUMFORD: Okay .
LILY: Here it is , some advice do the hard thing .
MUMFORD: That 's it ? That 's what you 're giving me ?
LILY: Clean up the mess . No matter what it takes . Mumford leans down to pet Ainge .
MUMFORD: What it might take is doing time .
LILY: Too bad . That 's tough , I mean it . I 'm not unsympathetic . But Skip says you 're in love .
MUMFORD: I 'll tell her tonight .
ROBERT STACK: A drug rehabilitation center in the lonely southwestern desert un by reclusive monks becomes the point of departure in a mysterious vanishing
MUMFORD'S SISTER: we did n't talk much after ou folks died , but I know he felt his life had taken a wrong turn
ROBERT STACK: His former undercover partner at the IRS is now a trooper with the Pennsylvania State Police
GREGORY: The guy was obsessed did n't always know where to draw the line but I would have trusted him with my wife er , my life What 'd I say ? Both , actually I ca n't say I was surprised , though , when he disappeared .
ROBERT STACK: Who was this enigma a courageous public servant or a debauched addict ? Either way , his last known stop was here isolated in the Arizona desert taken in by an order of devoted monks
BROTHER TIMOTHY: We do n't talk about the people who 've een our guests but I can tell you this about our order we believe everybody has the right to start over everybody deserves a second chance .
ROBERT STACK: And perhaps that is exactly the chance the now-sober pilgrim took on a blustery November day walking away from the rehab center neve to be heard from again
MUMFORD'S SISTER: I 'd like to know if he 's alive . If he is , I just hope he 's happy and his new life is well , I hope he 's found what he was looking for
ROBERT STACK: If you have any information about this man or know anything about his whereabouts , contact the Sheriff 's Department in Cochise County , Arizona , or call this number
MRS. COOK: Well , look who 's here
MUMFORD: Good evening , Mrs. Cook .
MRS. COOK: Just who is here , can you tell me ?
MUMFORD: Could I see Sofie , please ?
MRS. COOK: No , you can not . I would n't know who to say is calling .
SOFIE: Mother
MUMFORD: What do you think I 'm after , Mrs. Cook ?
MRS. COOK: Sofie . It 's so obvious you 're after my daughter .
MUMFORD: Well , I got ta say , Mrs. Cook , you 're ight about that .
MRS. COOK: It 'll never happen ! You 're in big trouble , mister .
SOFIE: Mother go away !
MUMFORD: I guess you saw the show ?
SOFIE: Which show was that ?
MUMFORD: Sofie
SOFIE: Part of it . We were watching `` ER '' until someone called .
MUMFORD: You probably got the idea .
SOFIE: Do you know what a betrayal this is ? Mumford knows .
MUMFORD: You 're not the only one
SOFIE: You feel violated ?
MUMFORD: Not me all my other my patients . I smelled tar and feathers on the way over here .
SOFIE: You deserve it . Mumford agrees . He watches her closely .
MUMFORD: But
SOFIE: But nothing I 'm mad as hell . This is a terrible thing you 've done .
MUMFORD: I know it ! Please believe me , I know that Mumford steps closer to her .
SOFIE: What ?
MUMFORD: Will you think about it ?
SOFIE: I do n't know . Depends . I 'm in a bad mood .
MUMFORD: I love you . More than I 've ever loved anyone or anything in my life . She looks into his eyes .
SOFIE: Oh .
MUMFORD: I want to spend the rest of my life with you but I 'm not sure you feel the same way .
SOFIE: I sort of do
MUMFORD: Anything just ask .
SOFIE: What is your name ? As Mumford breaks into a huge grin , CUT TO
JUDGE OTTO: Clarence Norman White , do you understand how serious are the crimes with which you have been charged ?
MUMFORD: I do .
JUDGE OTTO: Do you realize how insidious it is to invade the most private thoughts and secret lives of unsuspecting people ?
MUMFORD: Yes , your honor .
JUDGE OTTO: It means absolutely nothing to me that so many of your patients have come forward with praise for you and your therapeutic skills . You understand that ?
MUMFORD: Yes .
JUDGE OTTO: Mr. White , I am frustrated that the criminal code in this state allows a maximum sentence of only six months and a maximum fine of only $ 2000 .
MUMFORD: I 'm sorry , your honor .
JUDGE OTTO: What ?
MUMFORD: I 'm sorry you 're frustrated .
JUDGE OTTO: Are you disrespecting this court , Mr. White ?
MUMFORD: No , sir . I was empathizing . Sorry .
JUDGE OTTO: Maybe you can empathize with this Maximum fine . Three months in jail , three months house arrest . Sentence to begin immediately at the Orchard Valley Correctional Facility . Case closed . This court is adjourned .
LIONEL: It 's a country club . Do n't worry about it .
MUMFORD: Thanks for your help , Lionel .
LIONEL: I 'll have him out in half the time . WE PUSH IN on Mumford and Sofie , who embrace .
SOFIE: You got off easy .
MUMFORD: Will you wait for me ?
SOFIE: We 're only talking about six weeks .
MUMFORD: Will you be here ?
SOFIE: Of course I have n't got the energy to get out of town that fast .
CORRECTIONAL OFFICER: Better make yourself comfortable . We got a three hour drive here .
MUMFORD: I 'm fine .
CORRECTIONAL OFFICER: You 're the shrink , are n't you ?
MUMFORD: No , not really .
CORRECTIONAL OFFICER: But you do therapy ?
MUMFORD: Not any more .
CORRECTIONAL OFFICER: I 'll tell you , Doc , the wife and I , we got a little bit of a problem . Would you mind if I just ran it by you ?
MUMFORD: Go ahead .
THE END: < /pre
NARRATOR: Thebes . City of the Living . Crown jewel of Pharaoh Seti the First .
PHARAOH: What are you doing here ?
PRIESTS: Pharaoh 's bodyguards !
IMHOTEP: Her body was mummified , her vital organs removed and placed in sacred canopic jars .
O'CONNELL: I knew this was gon na be a lousy day .
BENI: Personally , I would like to surrender . Why can we not just surrender ?
O'CONNELL: Shut-up and gim me your bandolier .
BENI: Then let 's run away . Right now . While we can still make it .
O'CONNELL: Now gim me your revolver , you 'll neve use it anyway .
BENI: Then let 's play dead , huh ? Nobody ever does that anymore .
O'CONNELL: Now go find me a big stick .
BENI: In the desert ? What for ?
O'CONNELL: So I can tie it to your back , you appear to be without a spine .
BENI: I got caught robbing a synagogue . Lots of good stuff in them holy places ; churches , temples , mosques , and who 's guarding them ?
O'CONNELL: Altar boys ?
BENI: Exactly ! I speak seven languages , including Hebrew , so my specialty was synagogues . How about you ? Kill somebody ?
O'CONNELL: No , but I 'm considering it .
BENI: What then ? Robbery ? Extortion ? Kidnapping !
O'CONNELL: None of the above , thank you .
BENI: Then what the hell are you doing here ! ?
O'CONNELL: I was just looking for a good time .
EVELYN: Tuthmosis ? Now how did you get up here ?
CURATOR: Look at this ! Sons of the Messiah ! Give me frogs , flies , locusts , anything but this ! Compared to you , the other plagues were a joy !
EVELYN: I 'm sorry , it was an accident .
CURATOR: When Ramesses destroyed Syria , it was an accident . You are a catastrophe ! Why do I put up with you ?
EVELYN: You put up with me , because I can ead and write ancient Egyptian , decipher hieroglyphs and hieratic , and I 'm the only person within a thousand miles who knows how to properly code and catalogue this library .
CURATOR: Who needs smart women ? I put up with you because your mother and fathe were our finest patrons , Allah rest their souls . Now straighten up this mess !
EVELYN: Hello ?
JONATHAN: Drunkard ? Fool ? Rat-bastard ? Please call me something original .
EVELYN: Have you no respect for the dead ?
JONATHAN: Right now , I only wish to join them .
EVELYN: Well I wish you 'd do it sooner rathe than later , before you ruin my caree the way you 've ruined yours .
JONATHAN: My dear , sweet , baby sister , I 'll have you know , that at this moment my career is on a high note .
EVELYN: High note ? Ha ! For five years you 've een scrounging around Egypt , and what have you to show for it ? Nothing .
JONATHAN: Oh yes I do ! I have something right here !
EVELYN: Oh no , not another worthless trinket , Jonathan , if I bring one more piece of junk to the Curator to try and sell for you .
JONATHAN: On a dig , down in Thebes .
EVELYN: Jonathan ?
JONATHAN: Yes ?
EVELYN: I think you found something .
CURATOR: Perhaps . Jonathan leans in from across the desk .
JONATHAN: Two questions . Who the hell is Seti the First ? And was he rich ?
EVELYN: He was the last Pharaoh of the Old Kingdom , said to be the wealthiest Pharaoh of them all .
JONATHAN: Alright , good , that 's good . I like this fellow , like him very much .
EVELYN: I 've already dated it , this map is almost four thousand years old . And the hieratics over here It 's Hamunaptra .
CURATOR: My dear girl , do n't be ridiculous , we are scholars , not treasure hunters . Hamunaptra is a myth .
JONATHAN: Are we talking about the Hamunaptra ?
EVELYN: Yes . The City of The Dead . Where the early Pharaohs were said to have hidden the wealth of Egypt .
JONATHAN: Right , right , in a big underground treasure chamber . Everybody knows the story . The entire necropolis was igged to sink into the sand . On Pharaoh 's command , a flick of the switch ! And the whole place could disappear beneath the dunes .
EVELYN: All we know is that the city mysteriously vanished around 2,134
CURATOR: As the Americans would say it 's all fairy tales and hokum .
JONATHAN: You burned it ! You burned off the part with the lost city !
CURATOR: It 's for the best , I 'm sure . Many men have wasted their lives in the foolish pursuit of Hamunaptra , no one has ever found it , most have never returned .
JONATHAN: You killed my map .
CURATOR: I 'm sure it was a fake , anyway , I 'm surprised at you , Miss Carnarvon , to e so fooled .
EVELYN: You told me you found it on a dig down in Thebes !
JONATHAN: I was mistaken .
EVELYN: You lied to me !
JONATHAN: I lie to everybody , what makes you so special ?
EVELYN: I 'm your sister .
JONATHAN: That just makes you more gullible .
EVELYN: You stole it from a drunk at the local Casbah ? !
JONATHAN: Picked his pocket , actually .
EVELYN: And what is he in prison for ?
WARDEN: I did not know , so when I heard you were coming , I asked him that myself .
EVELYN: And what did he say ?
WARDEN: He said he was just looking for a good time .
EVELYN: But he 's just a filthy criminal ?
JONATHAN: Way to go , Evy .
O'CONNELL: So who 's the broad ?
EVELYN: Broad ? !
JONATHAN: She 's my sister , actually .
O'CONNELL: Yeah ? Well , I 'm sure she 's not a total loss .
WARDEN: I 'll be back in a moment .
O'CONNELL: I tremble with anticipation .
EVELYN: We uh , found your puzzle box , and we 've come to ask you about it .
O'CONNELL: No .
EVELYN: No ?
O'CONNELL: No You came to ask me about Hamunaptra .
EVELYN: How do you know the box pertains to Hamunaptra ?
O'CONNELL: Because that 's where I found it . I was there .
JONATHAN: How do we know that 's not a load of pig swallow ?
O'CONNELL: Hey , do n't I know you ?
JONATHAN: Um , well , you see
EVELYN: You were actually at Hamunaptra ?
O'CONNELL: I just decked your brothe
EVELYN: Yes , well I know my brother .
O'CONNELL: Yeah , I was there .
EVELYN: You swear ?
O'CONNELL: Every damn day .
EVELYN: No , I mean
O'CONNELL: I know what you mean . I was there , alright . Seti 's place . The City Of The Dead .
EVELYN: What did you find ? What did you see ?
O'CONNELL: I found sand . I saw death .
EVELYN: Could you tell me how to get there ? The exact location ?
O'CONNELL: Want to know ? Evelyn leans in even closer .
EVELYN: Yes .
O'CONNELL: Really want to know ?
EVELYN: Yes .
O'CONNELL: Then get me the hell outta here .
EVELYN: Where are they taking him ?
WARDEN: To be hanged .
EVELYN: I am an English woman .
WARDEN: I would pay one hundred pounds just to see him hang .
EVELYN: Two hundred pounds .
WARDEN: Proceed !
EVELYN: Three hundred pounds !
HANGMAN: Any last requests , pig ?
O'CONNELL: Yeah , I 'd like ya to let me go . The Hangman grabs the lever to the trapdoor .
WARDEN: And what else ?
EVELYN: NOOO !
WARDEN: His neck did not break ! Good ! Now we watch him strangle to death .
EVELYN: He knows the location to Hamunaptra . The warden spins around and faces her .
WARDEN: You lie .
EVELYN: I would never !
WARDEN: Are you saying this filthy godless son of a pig knows where to find The City Of The Dead ? Truly ?
EVELYN: Yes and if you cut him down , we will give you ten percent .
WARDEN: Fifty percent .
EVELYN: Twenty .
WARDEN: Forty .
O'CONNELL: Give give him give him GLAAAA
EVELYN: Twenty-five percent , and not one single farthing more .
CURATOR: She must die .
HOOK: She is like all the others . She will die in the desert .
CURATOR: No ! She has seen too much . She knows too much .
HOOK: The key ! ? She has the lost key ! ?
CURATOR: Yes . No one has ever had so much , een so close . We must stop her , o it will be the end of us all .
HOOK: Then we will kill her , we will kill her and all those with her .
CURATOR: And burn the map and retrieve the key .
HOOK: It will be done . But what of the American expedition ? They leave tomorrow as well .
CURATOR: Forget the bumbling Americans , they will be like all the others . Without the map to guide them , how can they possibly find Hamunaptra ?
BENI: It is three days down the Nile , then two days by camel , sahibs .
DANIELS: For all the money we 're paying you , something better god-damned well be under that sand .
HENDERSON: `` Hamunaptra , '' Daniels , that 's all ya got ta keep sayin , to yourself , `` Hamunaptra . ''
EVELYN: Do you really think he 'll show up ?
JONATHAN: Undoubtedly , I know the breed , he may be a cowboy , but his word is his word .
EVELYN: Personally , I think he 's filthy , ude and a complete scoundrel . I do n't like him one bit .
JONATHAN: Smashing day for the start of an adventure , eh , O'Connell ? O'Connell quickly checks his pockets .
O'CONNELL: Yeah , sure , smashing .
BURNS: You 're sure Hamunaptra is out there ?
BENI: Along with the scorched bones of my entire garrison , sahib .
EVELYN: Mister O'Connell , can you look me in the eye , and guarantee me this is not some sort of flimflam ? Because if it is , I 'm warning you
O'CONNELL: All I can tell you , miss , is that my Colonel found that map in an ancient fortress , and the whole damn garrison elieved in it so much , that without orders , we marched halfway across Libya and into Egypt to find that city . Like I told ya , all I saw was sand . Everybody else was wiped out y Tuareg warriors . I 'll take you ags .
JONATHAN: Yes , yes , you 're right , filthy , rude , a complete scoundrel , nothing to like there at all .
WARDEN: A bright good morning to all .
EVELYN: What are you doing here ?
WARDEN: I have come to protect my investment , thank you very much .
JONATHAN: Sit down , O'Connell , sit down , we could use another good player .
O'CONNELL: I only gamble with my life , never my money .
DANIELS: Never ? What if I were to wager five hundred dollars says we get to Hamunaptra before you ? O'Connell returns Daniel 's cocky look .
O'CONNELL: Yer on . Burns slips on his dirty bifocals .
BURNS: What makes you so confident , sir ?
O'CONNELL: What makes you ?
HENDERSON: We got us a man who 's actually been there .
JONATHAN: I say , what a coincidence , why
O'CONNELL: Sorry , did n't mean to scare ya .
EVELYN: The only thing that scares me , Miste O'Connell , are your manners .
O'CONNELL: Still angry that I kissed ya , huh ?
EVELYN: If you call that a kiss .
O'CONNELL: The last time I was at that place everybody I was with died .
EVELYN: Yes , I 'm hoping to find a certain artifact , a book , actually , my brothe thinks there 's treasure . What do you think is out there ? O'Connell looks into Evelyn 's eyes .
O'CONNELL: Evil . The Tuaregs and the Bedouin elieve that Hamunaptra is cursed , they call it , `` the doorway to hell . ''
EVELYN: Ahmar is Ossirion . `` Passageway to the underworld '' , actually . She gives him a know-it-all grin .
O'CONNELL: And the fact that they say it 's made out of pure gold , makes no nevermind to you , right ? Evelyn is surprised by his knowledge .
EVELYN: You know your history .
O'CONNELL: I know my treasure .
EVELYN: By the way , why did you kiss me ?
O'CONNELL: I was about to be hanged , seemed like a good idea at the time .
BENI: My very good friend ! What a surprise .
O'CONNELL: Why if it ai n't my little buddy , Beni . I oughta kill you .
BENI: You never were any good with the ladies , O'Connell .
O'CONNELL: So you 're the one leading the Americans , I shoulda figured . So what 's the scam ? You get 'em out in the middle of the desert then leave 'em to rot ?
BENI: Unfortunately no , these Americans are smart , they pay me only half now , half when I get them back to Cairo , so I must go all the way .
O'CONNELL: The girl saved my life , figured it was the least I could do , keep he out of trouble .
BENI: You always did have more balls than ains .
O'CONNELL: Let 's make us even , shall we ?
BENI: Even ?
O'CONNELL: Sounds familiar .
HOOK: Where is the map ?
O'CONNELL: Friend of yours ?
EVELYN: The map ! We need the map ! He shoves her up against a wall .
O'CONNELL: Relax ! I 'm the map ! It 's all up here .
EVELYN: Oh that 's comforting .
O'CONNELL: C'mon , there 's still one more of those guys around here somewhere .
JONATHAN: EVY ! !
O'CONNELL: Can you swim ?
EVELYN: Well of course I can swim , if the occasion calls for it .
O'CONNELL: Trust me . He picks her up and throws her over the side .
JONATHAN: Americans .
BENI: Hey O'Connell ! Looks to me like I got all the horses !
O'CONNELL: Hey Beni ! Looks to me like your on the wrong side of the river !
JONATHAN: I ca n't believe the price of these fleabags .
O'CONNELL: We coulda had 'em for free , all we had to do was give 'em your sister .
JONATHAN: Yes , awfully tempting , was n't it ?
O'CONNELL: Awfully .
JONATHAN: Never did like camels . Filthy buggers . They smell , they bite , they spit . Disgusting .
O'CONNELL: Yeah , disgusting .
EVELYN: Well I think they 're cute .
JONATHAN: And you snore !
WARDEN: I do not snore !
JONATHAN: All night you snored !
WARDEN: I have never snored !
O'CONNELL: We 're almost there .
EVELYN: Are you sure ? O'Connell looks down at the ground .
O'CONNELL: Pretty sure .
JONATHAN: What in bloody hell is this ? The Warden shivers in fear .
WARDEN: Other seekers of Hamunaptra .
BENI: Good morning , my friend !
DANIELS: Well , what the hell we doin ' ?
BENI: Patience , my good sahib , patience . Henderson looks over at O'Connell .
HENDERSON: First one to the city , O'Connell ! Five hundred ! Cash bucks !
O'CONNELL: Get ready .
EVELYN: For what ?
O'CONNELL: We 're about to be shown the way .
JONATHAN: Ah , begging your pardon , but should n't we be going ?
EVELYN: After all , you rode us night and day to win that bet .
BENI: Fools .
O'CONNELL: Evelyn ! Slow down !
DANIELS: Where 'd all these camels come from ?
BENI: They belong to the dead . They will wait years for their masters to return efore leaving .
JONATHAN: That thing gives me the creeps .
O'CONNELL: Be nice . That thing saved my life .
EVELYN: That `` thing '' gets me excited .
O'CONNELL: The things that get you excited .
EVELYN: According to Bembridge Scholars , inside the statue of Anubis was a secret compartment , perhaps containing The Book Of The Living .
O'CONNELL: What are those mirrors for ?
EVELYN: Ancient Egyptian trick . You 'll see .
WARDEN: Who cares ? I do n't see no treasure .
O'CONNELL: You 're welcome to my share of the spider webs .
JONATHAN: And it stinks to high heaven in here . Evelyn just rolls her eyes .
EVELYN: Cretins .
O'CONNELL: That is a neat trick .
EVELYN: Oh my god , It 's a preparation room .
O'CONNELL: Preparation for what ?
EVELYN: For entering the afterlife .
JONATHAN: Mummies , my good son , this is where they made the mummies .
HENDERSON: Ya scared the bejeezus out of us , O'Connell .
O'CONNELL: Likewise .
DANIELS: This here is our statue , friend .
O'CONNELL: Do n't see your name on it , pal .
BENI: Ten to one , O'Connell , your odds are no-so-good .
O'CONNELL: I 've had worse . Jonathan clenches a tiny derringer .
JONATHAN: Yes , me too .
EVELYN: Let 's be nice , children , if we 're going to play together , we must learn to share .
JONATHAN: And when those dirty Yanks go to sleep No offense .
O'CONNELL: None taken .
JONATHAN: We 'll sneak up and steal that book ight out from under them .
O'CONNELL: And you 're sure you can find the secret compartment ?
EVELYN: Yes , if their Egyptologist has n't already found it . Jonathan looks around .
JONATHAN: I say , what 's our smelly little friend got himself up to ?
EGYPTOLOGIST: Seti was no fool .
HENDERSON: Yeah , sure He looks back at the native Diggers .
O'CONNELL: Lem me get this straight , they stuck a sharp , red hot poker up your nose , cut your brain into small pieces , then ripped it all out through you nostrils ?
JONATHAN: OWCH ! That 's really got to hurt .
EVELYN: It 's called mummification . You 're dead when they do this
JONATHAN: Still
O'CONNELL: Yeah , that 'd bring you back to life .
EVELYN: You two are worse than a couple of schoolboys .
EGYPTOLOGIST: FENI !
EVELYN: Oh my god , it looks like , it looks like a sarcophagus .
O'CONNELL: Why would they bury somebody in the ceiling ?
EVELYN: They did n't , they buried him at the foot of Anubis . He was either someone of great importance . Or he did something very naughty .
JONATHAN: Well ? Who is it ?
EVELYN: 'He that shall not be named . ' O'Connell dusts off the huge LOCK
O'CONNELL: There 's some sort of lock here . You say these thing 's are made of granite with a steel interior ?
EVELYN: Quarried granite with a cobalt lining .
JONATHAN: Whoever 's in here , sure was n't getting out .
O'CONNELL: No kiddin ' , without a key , it 'll take us a month to crack this thing ,
EVELYN: A key ! That 's it ! That 's what he was talking about .
O'CONNELL: Who was talking about what ?
EVELYN: The man on the barge . The one with the hook , he was looking for a key .
JONATHAN: Hey that 's mine !
EVELYN: What do you suppose killed him ?
JONATHAN: Did you ever see him eat ? O'Connell comes up over some rocks .
O'CONNELL: Seems the Americans had a little misadventure of their own today , three of their diggers were killed .
EVELYN: How ?
O'CONNELL: Salt acid . Pressurized salt acid . Some sort of ancient booby-trap .
JONATHAN: Maybe this place really is cursed . A GUST OF WIND blows through the camp .
EVELYN: You two !
O'CONNELL: You do n't believe in curses , huh ?
EVELYN: No . I believe if I can see it and I can touch it , then it 's real . That 's what I believe .
O'CONNELL: I believe in being prepared .
JONATHAN: Seagrams !
O'CONNELL: Stay here !
JONATHAN: Evy ! Excuse me ! But did n't the man just say !
O'CONNELL: Goin ' somewhere ?
BENI: Just looking for you , O'Connell ! I wanted to be with my friend !
O'CONNELL: C'mon , friend .
BENI: Why do you like to fight so much ?
O'CONNELL: 'Cause I look good doin , it .
JONATHAN: Let 'em have it , boys !
O'CONNELL: You alright ?
EVELYN: Yes , fine , thank you .
DANIELS: See ! That proves it ! Old Seti 's fortune 's got ta be under this sand !
HENDERSON: For them to protect it like this , you just know there 's got to be treasure down there .
O'CONNELL: These men are a desert people . They value water , not gold .
EVELYN: Where 's Jonathan ?
O'CONNELL: Unlike your brother , Miss , you I do n't get . You 're a whole new brew .
EVELYN: I know , you 're wondering , what 's a place like me doing in a girl like this ?
O'CONNELL: Something like that .
EVELYN: Egypt is in my blood . My father was a famous explorer , he loved Egypt so much that he married an Egyptian . My mother ! Who was quite an adventure herself
O'CONNELL: Okay , I get your father , I get you mother and I get your brother , but what are you doing here ? Evelyn is insulted , she staggers to her feet .
EVELYN: I may not be an explorer , or an adventurer , or a treasure hunter , o a gunfighter ! Mister O'Connell But I 'm proud of what I am .
O'CONNELL: And what is that ?
EVELYN: I am a librarian !
O'CONNELL: No you 're not .
EVELYN: I 'm not ?
O'CONNELL: Not unless you call me Rick .
EVELYN: Why would I do that ?
O'CONNELL: Because that 's my name .
EVELYN: I ca n't believe I allowed the two of you to get me drunk .
JONATHAN: Do n't blame me , I do n't even remembe eing there .
EVELYN: Well neither do I , thank you . O'Connell gives her a hurt look .
O'CONNELL: You do n't ? Evelyn gives O'Connell a nervous look .
EVELYN: No Why ? Should I ?
O'CONNELL: Gee , yeah , you told me it was the est time you ever had .
EGYPTOLOGIST: There is a curse upon this chest .
DANIELS: Curse my ass .
HENDERSON: Yeah , who cares . The Egyptologist gives them the evil-eye
EGYPTOLOGIST: In these hallowed grounds , that which was set forth in ancient times , is as strong today , as it was then .
HENDERSON: Yeah , yeah , okay , what 's it
EGYPTOLOGIST: `` Death will come on swift wings to whomever opens this chest '' .
HENDERSON: Yeah , well , let 's just make sure we do n't bring anybody back from the dead then , huh ? The three Americans laugh .
EGYPTOLOGIST: He will kill all who open this chest , and assimilate their organs and fluids .
DANIELS: Assimilate their organs and fluids ? Ya mean eat 'em ?
EGYPTOLOGIST: And in so doing he will regenerate . And no longer be the undead , but a plague upon this earth .
HENDERSON: Ah hell , let 's open it anyways .
EVELYN: Oh my god , I 've dreamed about this ever since I was a little girl .
O'CONNELL: You dream about dead guys ?
EVELYN: Look , all the sacred spells have een chiseled off . The hieratics and hieroglyphs that protect the deceased on his journey into the afterlife , they 've been removed . This man was cursed , doomed .
O'CONNELL: Tough break .
JONATHAN: Yes , I 'm all tears , now let 's see who 's inside , shall we ?
BENI: The curse , beware the curse !
DANIELS: Stupid superstitious bastard .
O'CONNELL: Is he supposed to look like that ?
EVELYN: No . I 've never seen a mummy look like this . He 's , he 's still
JONATHAN: Juicy ?
EVELYN: Yes . He 's more than four thousand years old and still decomposing .
O'CONNELL: And look at this .
EVELYN: Oh my god , he was buried alive .
O'CONNELL: Where 's my gun ?
JONATHAN: What are you going to do ? Shoot him ?
O'CONNELL: If he decides to wake up , hell yes !
EGYPTOLOGIST: I have heard told of this book , but I never truly believed it existed . This , good gentlemen , is a most priceless treasure . Henderson kicks the sandy floor in anger .
HENDERSON: I would n't trade ya for a brass spittoon !
DANIELS: Yeah ! It 's supposed to be made outta pure gold !
JONATHAN: What is this stuff ? It smells like our late friend , the Warden .
O'CONNELL: Rat gizzards . They smell bad and taste worse , but that 's the best the desert has to offer .
HENDERSON: Say O'Connell , whadaya think these honey's 'll fetch back home ?
BURNS: We hear you gentlemen found yerselves a nice gooey mummy . Congratulations .
DANIELS: Ya know if ya dry him out , you can sell him for firewood .
EVELYN: Scarabs , flesh eaters , I found them inside our friend 's coffin . They can stay alive for years living off the flesh of a corpse , or in this case She shrugs , then looks at the roasting meat
O'CONNELL: Are you saying somebody threw these things in with our guy , and they slowly ate him alive ?
EVELYN: Very slowly .
JONATHAN: He certainly was not a popular fellow when they planted him .
O'CONNELL: Must of got a little too frisky with the Pharaoh 's daughter .
EVELYN: According to my readings , our friend suffered the HOM-DAI , the worst of all ancient Egyptian curses , one eserved for only the most evil lasphemers . In all of my research , I 've never read of this curse actually having been performed .
O'CONNELL: That bad huh ?
EVELYN: Yes , they never used it because they feared it so . It 's written , that if a victim of the HOM-DAI should eve arise , he would bring with him the ten plagues of Egypt .
O'CONNELL: The ten plagues ? You mean all ten plagues .
BENI: Like what that Moses guy did to that Pharaoh guy ?
EVELYN: That 's one way of putting it .
JONATHAN: Let 's see , there was frogs , flies , locusts
BURNS: Hail and fire .
HENDERSON: The sun turning black .
DANIELS: Water turning to blood .
JONATHAN: And my personal favorite people covered in boils and sores .
EVELYN: Fried gizzard anyone ?
O'CONNELL: You sure you outta be playin , around with that ?
EVELYN: It 's just a book , no harm ever came from a book .
JONATHAN: Did you see that ! ? Grasshoppers ! Billions of grasshoppers !
O'CONNELL: That 's one of the plagues , right ? The grasshopper plague !
EVELYN: This is not a plague . It 's generational . Every so many years the locusts of Egypt have a population explosion and they all take flight .
O'CONNELL: Okay , and what about frogs ?
BURNS: Daniels ! Henderson !
JONATHAN: EVY ! ?
EVELYN: Oh thank goodness , you 're one of the Americans , are n't you ?
IMHOTEP: Anck-su-namun ?
O'CONNELL: Damn-it ! Must be a trap door around here or somethin ' .
EVELYN: Help me , please , help me .
IMHOTEP: Kadeesh pharos Anck-su-namun !
O'CONNELL: Would you quit playin , around ! Let 's get outta here already !
O'CONNELL: Ahhhhhhhh ! !
ARDETH RAY: I told you to leave or die , you efused , and now you may have killed us all . For you have unleashed the creature that we have feared fo more than four thousand years .
O'CONNELL: Relax , I got him .
ARDETH RAY: No mortal weapons can kill this creature . He is not of this world .
O'CONNELL: Are we talkin , about the same creature ? The walking corpse ? Really ig mouth ? Really bad breath ?
BENI: May the good Lord protect and watch over me as a shepherd watches ove his flock . And may Satan in all his forms be vanquished forever .
IMHOTEP: The language of the slaves .
DANIELS: You bastards !
HENDERSON: What did you do to him ! ?
ARDETH RAY: We saved him ! Saved him before the creature could finish his work . Now leave , all of you , quickly , before he finishes you all .
JONATHAN: You 're not going to kill us ? Evelyn ELBOWS Jonathan in the ribs .
ARDETH RAY: We must now hunt him down , and try and find a way to kill him , before he consumes the earth . Allah be with us .
O'CONNELL: I told ya , I already got him !
ARDETH RAY: Know this , the creature will be coming for you . He must consummate the curse . And until he does , he will neve eat , he will never sleep , and he will never stop .
O'CONNELL: I thought you did n't believe in this stuff ! ?
EVELYN: Having an encounter with a fou thousand year old walking-talking corpse tends to convert one .
O'CONNELL: Forget it , we 're out the door down the hall and gone .
EVELYN: No , we are not .
O'CONNELL: Oh yes we are .
EVELYN: No we are not . We woke him up , and we must try and stop him .
O'CONNELL: We ? ! What we ? ! You did n't read that ook . I told you not to play around with that thing .
EVELYN: Alright then , Me , I , I read the ook , I woke him up and I intend to stop him .
O'CONNELL: How ! ? You heard the man , no mortal weapons can kill this guy .
EVELYN: Then we 'll have to find some immortal ones .
O'CONNELL: There goes that belief again . Not me , I am outta here !
EVELYN: According to that Book , once this creature has been reborn , his curse will spread , and as he grows in strength , so will his curse grow , infecting the people until the whole of the earth is destroyed .
O'CONNELL: Yeah ? So ? Is that my problem ?
EVELYN: It 's everybody 's problem !
O'CONNELL: Look lady , I appreciate you saving my life and all , but when I signed on , I agreed to take you out there and bring you back , and I did , now were even , end of job , end of story , contract terminated .
EVELYN: That 's what I am to you ? A contract ?
O'CONNELL: You can either tag along with me , o you can stay here and play around with Mister Maggot .
EVELYN: I 'm staying .
O'CONNELL: FINE .
BENI: You left me ! You left me in the desert to rot .
O'CONNELL: Oh yeah , sorry bout that . So who 's this guy ?
BENI: This is Prince Imhotep , High Priest of Osiris .
O'CONNELL: Oh , hey , how ya doin ' ?
BENI: The Prince does not like to be touched y other humans . A Silly eastern superstition , I 'm afraid .
O'CONNELL: Yeah , well , we all got our little problems today do n't we ?
BENI: He has come to help Mister Burns . Somehow I feel responsible .
O'CONNELL: Do n't gim me that , you never had any scruples .
BENI: Do you know where I can steal some ?
O'CONNELL: See ya around , Padre .
WINSTON: I 'm the last of the Royal Force still stationed here , you know ? All the other laddies died in the air and were buried in the sand .
O'CONNELL: I 've heard it before , Winston .
WINSTON: I just wish I would 've chucked it with the other laddies , gone down in a flame of glory , instead of sitting around here , rotting from boredom and booze !
BURNS: The drawer there , spectacles . As you see , I wo n't be needing them .
BENI: Mister Burns , Prince Imhotep thanks you for your spectacles , and fo your eyes , and for your tongue .
HENDERSON: Sweet Jesus ! That tasted just like , like
O'CONNELL: Blood .
JONATHAN: `` And the rivers and waters of Egypt went red and were as blood . ''
O'CONNELL: He 's here .
JONATHAN: Who 's here ! ?
O'CONNELL: The guy ! The Priest ! THE MUMMY !
EVELYN: The creature ! ? Are you sure ! ?
O'CONNELL: Pretty sure !
IMHOTEP: You saved me from the undead . Fo this , I shall make you immortal .
HENDERSON: The curse . The curse .
EVELYN: There 's only one person I know who can possibly give us some answers .
EVERYBODY: YOU !
CURATOR: Miss Carnavon . Gentlemen .
EVELYN: What is he doing here ?
CURATOR: Do you truly wish to know ? Or would you prefer to just shoot us ?
O'CONNELL: I just saw my fist vanish into some guy 's head .
CURATOR: You will not believe it .
O'CONNELL: Try me .
CURATOR: We are part of an ancient secret society , the cult-of-the-Mumia , and we have a sacred mission , passed down through thirty-nine generations . For over four thousand years we have guarded The City Of The Dead . we are sworn at manhood to do any and all in our power to stop the High Priest Imhotep from being reborn into this world .
ARDETH RAY: And because of you , we have failed .
EVELYN: And you think this justifies killing innocent people ! ?
CURATOR: To have stopped this creature ? Yes !
O'CONNELL: Okay , let 's cut to the chase . He 's afraid of cats , what 's that about ?
CURATOR: According to the ancients , cat 's are the guardians at the gates of the underworld . Imhotep will fear them until he is fully regenerated , and then he will fear nothing .
DANIELS: Right ! And ya know how he gets fully egenerated ? ! By killing everybody who opened that chest and sucking us dry ! That 's how !
CURATOR: Yes , the creature must first try and egenerate , and then he will attempt to resurrect the one he has loved for more than four thousand years .
EVELYN: Anck-su-namun .
CURATOR: It is because it was you who read from the Book . He has chosen you to e the human sacrifice needed to egenerate the body of Anck-su-namun .
JONATHAN: This is not good . Not good at all .
ARDETH RAY: Tonight is the full moon . The moon of Osiris . It will begin tonight .
JONATHAN: `` and he stretched forth his hands towards the heavens , and there was darkness throughout the land of Egypt . ''
EVELYN: We must stop him from regenerating . She turns to Daniels and Henderson .
HENDERSON: Well , there was me and Daniels here and then poor Burns of course , oh yeah , and that Egyptologist fella . O'Connell turns from the window .
O'CONNELL: What about my buddy , Beni ?
DANIELS: Naw , he scrammed outta there ,
EVELYN: We must find the Egyptologist and ing him back here to the safety of the fort , before the creature can get to him .
O'CONNELL: Okay , Evelyn , you wait here , you two come with me . All three of them pounce on him at once
HENDERSON: The hell with that ! I 'm not goin ' nowhere ! We 're safe here .
DANIELS: Yeah , I 'm not leavin , this fort fo nothin ' .
EVELYN: Who put you in charge ? You ca n't just leave me behind like some old suitcase . I 'm the one responsible for this mess and I intend to be the one to clean it up .
O'CONNELL: Keep an eye on her . If you leave he door , I 'll rip your spleen out . C'mon , Jonathan . Jonathan swallows hard and points to himself .
JONATHAN: Me ?
O'CONNELL: Lem me guess , spring cleaning ?
BENI: What friend ? You 're my only friend .
O'CONNELL: Then you got no excuse for living . What the hell you doin , being buddies with this creep , Beni ? What 's in it for you ?
BENI: It is better to be the right hand of the Devil , than in his path . As long as I serve him , I am immune .
O'CONNELL: Immune from what ?
BENI: You shall see .
O'CONNELL: What are you looking for ? Lie , and I 'll slit your throat .
BENI: The book ! The black book they found at Hamunaptra ! Imhotep wants it back . Said to me it would be worth it 's weight in diamonds .
O'CONNELL: What does he want the book for ?
BENI: Something about bringing his dead girly-friend back to life . He needs the book And your sister .
JONATHAN: That looked rather painful .
O'CONNELL: Ya know , ever since I met you , my luck has been for crap .
JONATHAN: Yes , I know , I do that to people .
O'CONNELL: Damn-it ! That 's two down and only two to go .
JONATHAN: And then he 'll be coming after Evy . They turn and race out of the office .
SOLDIER: Ten o'clock ! All is well !
DANIELS: The hell with this . I 'm goin , downstairs to get me a drink . You want somethin ' ?
HENDERSON: Yeah , get me a glass of bourbon , a shot of bourbon and a bourbon chaser .
O'CONNELL: Get your hands off my girl , pal .
EVELYN: You called me your girl ?
O'CONNELL: What ? Oh yeah , that was just um , you know , figure a speech .
EVELYN: I think you were jealous
O'CONNELL: Jealous ? You kiddin ' me ? Did you see that guy 's face ?
DANIELS: Shut-up ! JUST SHUT-UP ! We got ta do somethin ' ! we got ta do somethin , NOW ! Before it 's too late !
EVELYN: Last month I came across an inscription that mentioned The Book Of The Dead .
DANIELS: That book we found at Hamunaptra ?
EVELYN: Yes . I dismissed it , because it talked about bringing people back from the dead . A notion I was unwilling to elieve .
O'CONNELL: Believe it , sister . That 's what ought our buddy back to life .
JONATHAN: And now he 's going to use it to bring his girlfriend back
ARDETH RAY: And if he succeeds , the two of them together will bring about the apocalypse .
THE CURATOR: The plagues we have seen so far , are merely Imhotep flexing his muscles . Only at the moment of Anck-su-namun 's esurrection will he be truly invincible .
EVELYN: I 'm thinking that if the black Book Of The Dead can bring people back to life
CURATOR: then perhaps , the golden Book Of The Living can return them to the underworld .
EVELYN: Exactly
O'CONNELL: So your sayin ' , if we find the book made outta gold
CURATOR: And read the sacred incantations contained inside it .
O'CONNELL: You think it 'll send this guy back to hell ?
CURATOR: Correct , And that 's when
ARDETH RAY: It has begun . The beginning of the end .
EVELYN: Not quite yet it has n't . C'mon .
O'CONNELL: Got what ?
EVELYN: Since the black Book of The Dead was found inside the statue of Anubis , then according to this , the golden Book of The Living should be inside
O'CONNELL: What ?
JONATHAN: What ?
DANIELS: WHAT ! ?
EVELYN: The golden Book Of The Living , is inside the statue of Horus .
CURATOR: Which would be located not far to the east of the Anubis statue .
O'CONNELL: Do n't tell me we got ta go back out there ?
CURATOR: If we want to kill the creature , yes .
JONATHAN: Anck-su-namun ! Anck-su-namun !
BENI: Imhotep ! IMHOTEP !
O'CONNELL: You 're gon na get yours , pal !
EVELYN: He 's gorgeous .
THE CURATOR: He has consummated the curse , now all he need do is raise Anck-su-namun from the dead , then it will be the end of us , and the beginning fo them .
IMHOTEP: Koontash dai na .
BENI: Take his hand and he will spare the others .
EVELYN: Any bright ideas ? O'Connell talks through angry , grit teeth .
O'CONNELL: Sorry , fresh out .
EVELYN: I have no choice .
IMHOTEP: Keetah mi pharos , aja nilo , isirlan .
BENI: Come with me my princess . It is time to make you mine , forever .
EVELYN: All eternity , idiot .
O'CONNELL: Got guts , lady .
EVELYN: Yes , I know , and I 'd like to keep them .
JONATHAN: Hey that 's mine !
O'CONNELL: Evelyn ! The huge , powerful man holds him tight .
ARDETH RAY: Be calm . There is still time . We can stop him yet .
IMHOTEP: Pared oos . Evelyn SCREAMS .
EVELYN: NOOO ! !
BENI: Kill them .
O'CONNELL: EVELYN !
CURATOR: Go ! Find a way ! Kill the creature !
O'CONNELL: We got ta get her back .
JONATHAN: I 'm with you , old man . No one touches my sister like that and gets away with it . O'Connell looks at Ardeth Ray .
O'CONNELL: You know where he 's taking her ?
ARDETH RAY: Yes . To Hamunaptra . To perform the itual . Jonathan looks worried .
JONATHAN: And what ritual would that be ?
ARDETH RAY: The ritual to bring the body of Anck- su-namun back to life .
JONATHAN: And how does one do that ?
ARDETH RAY: By reading the Book Of The Dead .
JONATHAN: Oh yes , of course .
ARDETH RAY: And then killing your sister .
JONATHAN: Excuse me ? Ardeth Ray looks at O'Connell .
ARDETH RAY: Imhotep is now able to cross the desert with great haste . Jonathan taps him in the shoulder .
JONATHAN: Begging your pardon , but I was n't quite clear on that last part . Ardeth Ray ignores him .
ARDETH RAY: If he arrives before us , it will be too late .
JONATHAN: Did you say 'kill ' my sister ? O'Connell smiles .
O'CONNELL: I know how to beat him to it .
WINSTON: So what 's your little problem got to do with His Majesty 's Royal Air Corp ?
O'CONNELL: Not a god-damned thing . Winston looks intrigued .
WINSTON: Is it dangerous ?
O'CONNELL: You probably wo n't live through it . This really interests him .
WINSTON: By Jove , do you really think so ?
JONATHAN: Everybody else we 've bumped into has died , why not you ? Winston nods his head , he 's hooked .
WINSTON: So what 's the challenge then ?
O'CONNELL: To save the damsel in distress , kill the bad guy and steal his treasure .
WINSTON: Winston Havlock at your service , sir !
EVELYN: What just happened ?
BENI: All I remember is him turning into a last of sand , and then I remembe nothing .
WINSTON: Hang on , men !
EVELYN: Stop it ! You 'll kill them !
JONATHAN: Excuse me A little help would be useful IF IT 'S NOT TOO MUCH
O'CONNELL: Okay , now what the hell does this Horus guy look like ?
JONATHAN: He 's a big fellow with pointy ears and a face like a falcon .
O'CONNELL: Got it .
BENI: Keep moving . Evelyn gives him a look .
EVELYN: You know , nasty little fellows such as yourself , always get thei comeuppance . Beni suddenly looks worried .
BENI: Yeah ?
EVELYN: Oh yes , always .
JONATHAN: I say , look at that .
O'CONNELL: From now on , do n't touch anything . Not a damn thing . Keep your hands off the furniture , got it ? Jonathan swallows hard and nods vigorously .
BENI: Prince Imhotep wants your heart .
EVELYN: Tell him , I 'm truly flattered but that it 's already taken .
BENI: He wants your heart and your brain , your liver , your kidneys Evelyn 's eyes widen .
EVELYN: Intestines .
BENI: Yeah ! Them .
EVELYN: You only want me for my organs ? !
O'CONNELL: Who the hell are these guys ?
ARDETH RAY: Priests . Imhotep 's priests .
O'CONNELL: I never killed a priest before .
ARDETH RAY: They are evil , cursed , they matte not .
O'CONNELL: Well , okay then .
IMHOTEP: Kill them ! Kill them all ! And bring me the Book Of The Living !
ARDETH RAY: My turn .
O'CONNELL: This whole place is comin , alive !
ARDETH RAY: I 'm out .
JONATHAN: There he is ! They run up to the base of the statue ,
ARDETH RAY: Allow me .
O'CONNELL: These guys just do n't quit .
ARDETH RAY: Keep digging !
O'CONNELL: That 's the last one , we better get lucky .
IMHOTEP: With your death , my love and I will e invincible !
JONATHAN: I found it , Evy ! I found it
EVELYN: Shut-up and get me off of here !
JONATHAN: I ca n't open it ! It 's locked o something !
EVELYN: Read the inscription on the cover !
JONATHAN: Keetash-something , naraba-something .
O'CONNELL: This just keeps gettin , better and etter .
JONATHAN: You have got to be joking ? Evelyn is backing away from Anck-su-namun .
EVELYN: Finish the inscription , idiot !
JONATHAN: Oh .
EVELYN: What 's it look like ! ?
JONATHAN: It 's an Anck symbol , with two little squiggly lines above it , and a bird , a stork ! on either side . Evelyn is being STRANGLED by Anck-su-namun .
EVELYN: Ah ! Ah ! Ahmenophus !
JONATHAN: Yes , I see .
O'CONNELL: Okay pal , let 's see how tough you are without your right arm .
JONATHAN: I got it ! Evelyn runs for Jonathan .
EVELYN: Kadeesh mal ! Kadeesh mal ! Pared oos !
O'CONNELL: C'mon !

JONATHAN: Well , I guess we go home empty handed . O'Connell looks at Evelyn .

BRIAN: Hello , Roberta .
ROBERTA: I thought you moved away .
BRIAN: I did . I 'm in town for my Mom 's irthday .
ROBERTA: Oh ! Sorry .
BRIAN: It looks very pretty .
ROBERTA: Thank you . I heard you had a book published . I did n't read it but
BRIAN: That 's O.K . My parents did n't read it either . It looks good on thei coffee table , though . Roberta smiles .
ROBERTA: My college professors said it was too late I had n't had enough training to be a concert violinist . So I got a teaching degree instead .
BRIAN: I 'll bet you 're a great teacher .
ROBERTA: I think I am . It 's just that See , every time I 'd get started somewhere , Charles would be transferred then I had my kids and took time off to raise them and then when I decided to teach again , no one would hire me 'cause you ca n't count on a navy wife to stick around . I finally decided I 'd start my own program Charles gave me the money and I bought fifty violins from this little Greek shop got started at a private school and then
BRIAN: Your husband ran off with your best friend . A beat .
ROBERTA: She was n't my `` best '' friend . She was a friend . Charles is the last person you 'd think would cheat on me he neve oke a rule I wake up one night it 's like one in the morning and he 's not in ed . I go outside and our neighbor this old Greek guy is sitting out there , smoking a cigar , so I ask if he 's seen my husband . `` He 's taking a walk with the other officer 's wife , '' he says . `` He takes a walk every night with the other officer 's wife . ''
BRIAN: So you 're just gon na wrap presents and wait for him to come back ?
ROBERTA: You sound like my mother .
BRIAN: That 's not very sexy .
ROBERTA: Are you trying to be sexy or be my friend ?
BRIAN: A little of both .
ROBERTA: Great !
BRIAN: If she hires you , though , you have to be willing to relocate .
ROBERTA: Where is it ?
TAXI DRIVER: Welcome to East Harlem .
JANET: Aside from half a term in a private school in Greece and a yea teaching chorus in Hawaii ten years ago it does n't look like you 've had any other teaching experience .
ROBERTA: Well , not traditional teaching experience . I 've been doing private lessons Janet looks for this on the resume .
JANET: I 'd like to help you , Mrs. Demetras . Brian spoke highly of you and I told him I 'd consider starting a violin class But without the prope qualifications , and without any experience in an inner city school Roberta nods , defeated .
ROBERTA: I 'm sorry to interrupt , but I wanted you to meet my sons Nick , Lexi They enter .
JANET: This is Dennis Rausch , our music teacher and program coordinator . Mrs. Demetras , did n't I make things clear yesterday ?

NICK: Since I was three .
LEXI: Maybe since I was three and a half .
JANET: Your mom must be a good teacher .
NICK: She 's O.K . Roberta gives Nick a look , but Janet smiles .
JANET: If you could teach our students to play like that , I 'd be thrilled , but
ROBERTA: I can . Any child can learn the violin .
DENNIS: Assuming they had the discipline .
ROBERTA: I 'll teach them to have discipline .
JANET: A lot of our parents are struggling to feed their kids and pay the rent they do n't have time to help them learn violin .
ROBERTA: They do n't have to . If they can help , great but these kids will be committed . They 'll practice on thei own , they 'll help each other in the classroom
DENNIS: I think I know these students , Miss Demetras . Their attention span does n't go past do-re-mi . Maybe on a good day , I can get them to `` fa . ''
ROBERTA: You 're underestimating them . They can play as well as any other kids .
DENNIS: That I 'd like to see .
ROBERTA: You will .
JANET: For now I 'll put you down as a sub , ut I have to warn you even if it works out , the Board may not let me create a permanent position for you .
ROBERTA: That 's O.K . I 'll worry about that later . Thank you .
DENNIS: Well , I 've already planned out the whole term , and I can tell you right now , there 's no room for this ! Besides , where you gon na find money for violins ?

BRIAN: It 's a toast . To Roberta , who 's made it through her first week . They clink glasses and drink .
ROBERTA: I do n't know , Brian . I 'm hanging on y a thread there . Out of fifty kids , maybe six are listening to me .

ROBERTA: You had at least five different girlfriends .
BRIAN: It did n't mean I had the one I wanted .

NAEEM: I ca n't be in violin class anymore .
ROBERTA: Why not ?
NAEEM: My mother wo n't let me .
ROBERTA: What ?
MRS. ADISA: My son 's got more important things to do than learn dead white men 's music .
ROBERTA: They 're gon na learn `` Twinkle Twinkle Little Star '' !
MRS. ADISA: How many Black classical composers can you name ? How many Black classical violinists do you know ?
ROBERTA: That does n't mean it 's the way it should be . Naeem 's learning to play music and that makes him feel good about himself . Why should it matter who wrote it ?
NAEEM: Please , Mom ? Ca n't I be in the class ?
MRS. ADISA: Look . I 've seen this before . You white women come up here and think you can rescue our poor inner city children who never asked to be rescued in the first place . No thank you .
ROBERTA: Brian Turner 's room , please .
ALICE: And which ocean is this ?
ROBERTA: Excuse me I 'm here for the violin students .
ALICE: You 're late .
ROBERTA: Just a couple of minutes I 'm sorry .
ALICE: They 're having a lesson now .
ROBERTA: But this is when they have violin class !
ALICE: That 's not my problem .
ROBERTA: I thought all the teachers agreed to this .
JANET: In theory . Adam ! I want you in my office right after lunch , you understand ?
ADAM: What 'd I do ?
JANET: Think about it ! Whenever you pull kids out , it 's a disruption , plus it 's extra work fo the teacher 'cause they have to fill the kids in on what they missed . Some teachers resent it .
ROBERTA: Well , ca n't you talk to them ?
JANET: I took this off a second-grader this morning . I 'll help you Roberta ut I ca n't hold your hand here . Janet starts to walk away , then turns .
ROBERTA: So pretend you 're driving a car and I 'm the policeman and I say STOP ! Thumb up , fingers straight up , flat palm . Now you be policemen , but turn your hand and make it say stop to yourself .
DE SEAN: You 're under arrest .
ROBERTA: Knock it off , De Sean ! If you kids ca n't take this seriously , I do n't want you here . I 'm teaching you a difficult instrument because I espect you and have faith that you can learn it . But none of that matters if you do n't have respect fo yourself .
BRIAN: I ca n't believe you were still holding out hope . The guy has n't called you or the kids in three months I thought you 'd moved on .
ROBERTA: I never said that .
BRIAN: No ? Maybe not with words . This embarrasses her , then pisses her off .
ROBERTA: You know what ? I should n't have called you . This was a mistake .
BRIAN: No , no I 'm sorry . Look , I know it hurts , but you 're gon na get through this , Roberta you will .
ROBERTA: I 'm moving back to my Mom 's .
BRIAN: What ? You 're gon na quit teaching in the middle of the term ?
ROBERTA: I do n't fit in there I 'm not making any progress with the kids
BRIAN: What are you gon na tell Janet your husband left you and nothing else matters ?
ROBERTA: I do n't know yet .
BOY: My mother gave it to me .
JANET: Why would she give you fifty dollars ?
BOY: To buy breakfast . Janet gives him a stern look .
JANET: Do you know how hard your mothe works ? Do you think it 's right fo you steal from her ?
BOY: I did n't !
JANET: Well let 's go call her right now and ask her .
ROBERTA: I need to speak to you . It 's important .
JANET: It 'll have to wait . Come on . In my office .
ROBERTA: Guadalupe ? What are you doing here ?
GUADALUPE: I ca n't get the stop sign .
ROBERTA: Honey , your teacher 's probably looking for you .
GUADALUPE: I ca n't come anymore . It 's too hard .
ROBERTA: The violin is hard for everyone .
GUADALUPE: But everyone else is better than me . I 'll always be slow .
ROBERTA: Did you ever hear of Itzhak Perlman ?
GUADALUPE: No .
ROBERTA: He 's one of the greatest violinists in the world , and he has problems with his legs too . He walks with two canes but he still makes the most eautiful music .
GUADALUPE: And he sits down when he plays ?
ROBERTA: He has to . Guadalupe takes this in .
GUADALUPE: He was your student ? Roberta laughs .
ROBERTA: No . But if he was , I 'd tell him the same thing I 'm telling you . You should n't quit something just because it 's hard .
GUADALUPE: But I ca n't stand strong .
ROBERTA: Standing strong does n't only mean using your legs . You can stand strong on the inside too . Know what I mean ?
JANET: You wanted to speak to me ?
ROBERTA: Oh . Umm that 's O.K . It 's taken care of . Janet looks at her curiously , then exits .
LANDLADY: Is just for you and your boys ?
ROBERTA: Yes .
LANDLADY: No husband ? No boyfriend ? A beat .
ROBERTA: No .
LEXI: Look what I made you , Mommy !
ROBERTA: That is so beautiful !
ISABEL: Whatsa matter you got cooties ?
ROBERTA: Apparently .
ISABEL: I 'll take my chances . Isabel Vasquez . Second grade .
ROBERTA: Roberta Demetras . I 'm the
ISABEL: Violin teacher . I know .
ROBERTA: Is it my imagination , or does everyone hate me ?
ISABEL: It 's hard to fit in when you 're doing a special program . People figure you 're not gon na be here very long , so why make the effort ? It may take a while for folks to warm up , but nobody hates you .
ROBERTA: What about Alice Crowley ?
ISABEL: A ) she thinks the violin 's a waste of time and B ) she 's a bitch . Roberta laughs .
ROBERTA: And then there 's Dennis .
ISABEL: The Music Man . You 've had the bodacity to threaten his private little empire not to mention the fact that you messed up his sacred scheduling chart .
ROBERTA: How come you 're being nice to me ?
ISABEL: Ulterior motives . I want my daughte in your class next year . Roberta smiles .
ROBERTA: If I 'm here next year .
ISABEL: You will be .
NICK: In Greece , we could see the ocean . Remember ?
ROBERTA: I remember . And the fishing boats
NICK: And the octopuses . Roberta smiles and puts her arm around him .
ROBERTA: Well , that 's something I 've been wanting to talk to you about . Daddy 's not gon na live with us anymore . You and Lexi will have special times when you stay with him , like at Christmas . A beat .
NICK: Can you tell the birthday story ?
ROBERTA: Do n't you want to talk about what I told you ?
NICK: I want to hear the birthday story .
ROBERTA: It was the day of Grandpa 's birthday , and I was sad because he had died a few months back .
NICK: But you knew I 'd be born that day .
ROBERTA: So I packed a bag and got all ready
NICK: And Daddy laughed .
ROBERTA: I said , `` It 's my father 's birthday , and the baby 's gon na be born today . ''
NICK: He did n't believe you . But I was orn . The same day as Grandpa .
ROBERTA: It was a happy day .
NICK: Was Daddy happy too ?
ROBERTA: Of course he was .
NICK: Then why is he leaving me ?
ROBERTA: He 's not leaving you , Nick . He loves you and Lexi very much .
NICK: Then why ca n't he live here ?
ROBERTA: It 's very hard to explain Sometimes things happen between grown-ups and they just ca n't be together .
DE SEAN: My asthma it was very bad and I had to go to the hospital .
ROBERTA: Again ? You told me you went to the hospital last week .
DE SEAN: Oh yeah . Maybe it was last week . Roberta rolls her eyes , then turns to Lucy .
ROBERTA: Lucy you sounded the worst of all . Have you practiced ?
LUCY: No .
ROBERTA: Why not ? You ca n't be in this class if you do n't practice !
LUCY: My grandma got mugged . A beat .
ROBERTA: Oh . I 'm sorry . Is she O.K . ?
LUCY: She died . Roberta stands there , sobered .
ROBERTA: I 'm really sorry , Lucy . Just do the best you can .
NAEEM: Hi , Roberta .
ROBERTA: Hi , Naeem . Can I talk to your mom for a minute ? Naeem nods and moves off .
TANISHA: Do you have two of those skirts ?
ROBERTA: What ?
TANISHA: You wore a skirt just like it on Monday . Some of the kids crack up .
ROBERTA: You know , Tanisha I do n't think that 's such an important question . O.K . Let 's try
MRS. ADISA: Naeem and I were wondering if he could still be in the class . A beat .
ROBERTA: I 'd love that . You 'll have a lot of catching up to do . You think you can work that hard ?
NAEEM: Yeah , I can .
ROBERTA: Maybe we can also arrange some private lessons at my house .
MRS. ADISA: I would n't have the money for that .
ROBERTA: That 's O.K . Why do n't you go grab one of my spare violins ?
LUCY: Twinkle .
ROBERTA: Everyone stop ! Let me hear .
LUCY: No . I made it up .
ROBERTA: That 's really great , Lucy . I 'm proud of you . Lucy beams .
MRS. LAMB: You 're shouting at them . All the time .
ROBERTA: Not all the time . But if they do n't listen
MRS. LAMB: Did n't you tell them that they were making their parents sick ? Janet raises her eyebrows at this .
ROBERTA: That was n't exactly what I said
MRS. LAMB: I 'm raising Becky in a supportive atmosphere . I do n't send her to school to be abused .
ROBERTA: I 'm just trying to discipline them . If they 're gon na learn an instrument , they need to take it seriously
JANET: I think what Mrs. Lamb is trying to say , Roberta , is that you 're a little too harsh . I 'm sure you might be able to soften some of your comments to the children ?
ROBERTA: Well , that was that was pretty good that was n't too bad
DE SEAN: It was n't ? I thought we stunk .
ROBERTA: I would n't put it that way You all just need to practice a bit more . James , have you practiced this week ? The boy nervously shakes his head no .
DE SEAN: Why you acting like that ?
ROBERTA: Like what ?
DE SEAN: Nice .
ROBERTA: Do n't you want a nice teacher ?
DE SEAN: I already got nice teachers . You added some variety .
LUCY: Yeah . We like you better the way you used to be .
ROBERTA: Oh . What about you , Becky ?
BECKY: Yeah . This is even worse . You 're acting weird now . A beat .
ROBERTA: Well , then I take it back . You all stunk . The kids laugh .
LEXI: Ca n't you come with us ? Please ?
ROBERTA: Honey , I told you . This is Daddy 's special time with you .
FLIGHT ATTENDANT: I 'll take good care of them .
ROBERTA: Who is it ?
BRIAN: I 'm back .
ROBERTA: O.K. , enough goofing off back to work .
BRIAN: You trying to kill me ? She laughs and they kiss .
ASSUNTA: I was the only person in the whole coffee shop not speaking Spanish . Roberta rolls her eyes . O.S . a car BACKFIRES .
ROBERTA: I work in this neighborhood , Mama . I want to live here .
ASSUNTA: What 's your name ?
LAWRENCE: Lawrence .
ASSUNTA: You hungry , Lawrence ?
BRIAN: Hey , your daughter does what she wants or have n't you noticed ?
ASSUNTA: I 've noticed .
ROBERTA: Having my own place will make me feel like I 'm really starting my life again .
ASSUNTA: But if you invested your divorce settlement , you could buy something nice someday . It 's bad enough that you 've been renting in this neighborhood , but to lock yourself into a mortgage
ROBERTA: Mama , please . Just stop !
ASSUNTA: How much do you know about this man ?
ROBERTA: Brian 's a good person , he 's helped me a lot , he 's great with the boys since he got back to town , it 's been eally sweet .
ASSUNTA: And how long has he been back ?
ROBERTA: Two months .
ASSUNTA: That 's not very long . Do n't make the same mistake twice , Bert . You barely knew Charles when you married him .
ROBERTA: I do n't get it you 're ragging on me about buying the house I would think you 'd want Brian to live with me .
ASSUNTA: Not if he 's the wrong person .
ROBERTA: Get ready , now we 're coming up to the fermata They reach a certain note , then pause .
DE SEAN: Man . We 'll never get that right .
ROBERTA: That 's not a very nice thing to say about your classmates . How many people think they can get it right by the concert ?
BRIAN: I 'm sorry . It 's just Roberta looks at him , offended .
ROBERTA: What ?
BRIAN: Why do people feel like the minute something 's going great , they got ta name it ? Once you name something , you snuff the life out of it . She disentangles from him .
ROBERTA: Jesus , Brian . Do you still get away with that crap ? It 's not the Sixties anymore .
BRIAN: Well , maybe if you 'd actually gone through the Sixties , you 'd know what I 'm talking about .
ROBERTA: Fine ! We wo n't name it , we wo n't talk about it , we 'll act like we have no feelings for each othe whatsoever !
BRIAN: I 'm sorry . I 'm being an asshole . You can say you love me if you want .
ROBERTA: Forget it . I changed my mind .
ERNIE: Well , if I could just remember what I did here yesterday , I 'd be moving a whole lot faster . You look real pretty today , honey .
BRIAN: You 're crazy . Why did you hire him ?
ROBERTA: He needed a job . Besides , he 's wired all of East Harlem .
BRIAN: When ? Fifty years ago ?
ROBERTA: Why is there wallpaper on it ?
MAN #1: That 's how it comes .
ERNIE: Yep , that 's how it comes now .
BRIAN: What the hell is this ?
ROBERTA: Sheetrock .
BRIAN: You 've got ta be kidding . Those ex- cons you hired ripped this off and you too !
ROBERTA: Look this house is taking every penny of my settlement . I ca n't afford fancy union workers !
BRIAN: Fine . Do it your way .
JANET: I 'm giving him a two-day suspension ut next time he 'll be expelled .
ROBERTA: There wo n't be a next time I promise .
JANET: Have you noticed your son lately ? He 's tied up in knots and he needs help .
ROBERTA: Janet , kids fight . You 're making too much of this .
JANET: He was choking the kid . Nick 's in trouble , Roberta . You need to deal with it . Roberta takes this in , upset .
ROBERTA: Keep playing , guys .
NICK: It 's my house ! They do n't live here I do !
ROBERTA: Nick honey the kids are real nervous about the Spring concert . You could probably give them some pointers .
NICK: I do n't feel like it .
ROBERTA: I said no .
BRIAN: Good catch Nick !
NICK: Do n't ! Do n't throw me in !
BRIAN: Whatsa matter ? Afraid of a little water ? The ducks are n't afraid ! Are you a chicken or a duck ?
NICK: Do n't ! Do n't throw me !
BRIAN: Looks like you got yourself a chicken , Roberta !
NICK: I 'm not a chicken !
BRIAN: Well then you must be a duck !
LEXI: Throw me in the water , Brian ! Do it to me !
ROBERTA: You seem to be the only one who can get Nick to laugh these days .
BRIAN: He misses his dad . I 'm just a surrogate .
ROBERTA: No I think Nick really likes you . You know we 're all hoping you 'll move into the new house with us .
BRIAN: Whoa . Can we just slow down here a minute ? It 's too much like getting married .
ROBERTA: What 's so bad about that ?
BRIAN: That kind of commitment just is n't ealistic . I mean , how can we know that you and I will even be able to stand each other in five years ?
ROBERTA: Well , we do n't . But if two people care about each other , they take a chance .
BRIAN: And look what happened to you and Charles .
ROBERTA: I 'm not talking about Charles . I 'm talking about us .
BRIAN: Look , Roberta . Marriage is based on a belief that one person can completely meet another person 's needs . I just do n't buy that .
ROBERTA: What are you saying ? If there 's some need you have that I do n't meet , you 'd go and get it `` met '' by someone else ?
BRIAN: I 'm saying that it 's the 80 's and it 's a fantasy to think of marriage lasting these days . One out of two marriages ends in divorce !
ROBERTA: You did n't answer my question . If I do n't meet all your needs , and we 're in a committed relationship forget marriage for a minute ; I 'm just talking about a relationship would you go to someone else ? A beat .
BRIAN: In theory , yes .
ROBERTA: In theory .
BRIAN: Roberta , we 've got something good ight now that 's the important thing . Let 's just keep it that way ,
ROBERTA: He just ca n't , O.K. ? Brian 's at his house tonight , and we 're at ours .
NICK: Well then I wan na go to his house .
ROBERTA: Enough , Nick . Now why do n't you and your brother practice while I make dinner .
NICK: I do n't feel like practicing .
ROBERTA: Well do it anyway .
NICK: I wan na go to Brian 's !
ROBERTA: Stop whining , and get your violin .
NICK: The problem with you is you 're mean to everybody and then they do n't want to be with you !
ROBERTA: I 've heard just about enough from you , young man . Now set your violin up properly and start practicing .
NICK: I hate the violin !
ROBERTA: You pick that violin up right now and do n't you ever ever
NICK: It 's all your fault ! You made Daddy leave and you 're gon na make Brian leave too ! You 're gon na be all alone and I 'll have to take care of you !
ROBERTA: Nick you do n't have to take care of me .
NICK: Then who 's going to ?
ROBERTA: I 'll take care of myself and I 'll take care of you and Lexi . I promise .
NICK: You did n't try hard enough . You made Daddy leave us .
ROBERTA: That 's not true . I begged him not to leave , but he did n't listen .
NICK: Why not ?
ROBERTA: Your father met someone he liked more than Mommy , and then
NICK: Who ?
ROBERTA: Lana . Remember our friends Lana and Tom ?
NICK: Is he gon na marry her now ?
ROBERTA: No , but he 's not coming back to me .
BRIAN: You 're an idiot ! I told you you ca n't be your own contractor .
ROBERTA: You 're right . I 'm an idiot . She crosses to Ernie and shakes him .
BRIAN: That 's more like it .
ROBERTA: You 're fired too . Brian laughs .
BRIAN: Roberta
ROBERTA: Get out .
WOMAN: That 's the one Lucy wrote !
ISABEL: C'mon everybody , settle down Janet wants to talk to you .
JANET: Today 's a very special day because we 're starting the tenth year of the East Harlem Violin Program . This is a wonderful opportunity for you , so I want you to talk to your parents about whether you 'd like to try this .
ISABEL: My daughter took violin with Roberta when she was your age , and now she 's in high school and she still talks about how much she loved it .
DENNIS: Janet and I started this program ecause we knew how much you kids could benefit from it .
JUSTIN: Who 's that lady in the back ?
JANET: That 's Dorothea Van Hauften
JUSTIN: Say what ? What kinda name is that ?
ISABEL: Justin sshh !
JANET: and she 's taking pictures of Roberta 's classes for a magazine article about music education .
JUSTIN: I wan na be in the magazine !
ISABEL: First things first , Justin . Roberta 's gon na explain to you about the `` lottery . ''
ROBERTA: I used to just teach fifty kids at this school . But now I teach a hundred and fifty kids at three East Harlem schools and there 's so many children who want to take violin classes that we have to have a lottery .
VANESSA: Can I be in the class ?
ISABEL: Roberta 's explaining that . Just listen .
ROBERTA: After your parents sign you permission slips , I 'm gon na put them in a sack , and I 'll pick fifty names from each school .
ISABEL: Remember , she 's just picking names from a hat . It does n't mean that anyone 's better than anyone else . RAMON raises his hand .
RAMON: I really really hope that I get in the class .
ROBERTA: I hope so too .
RACHEL: How come you guys do n't play the violin ?
LEXI: Well , picture her being your teache and your mother .
ROBERTA: Hi Rachel . Be right with you .
NICK: No . I 'm done .
ROBERTA: Already ? You 've barely practiced .
NICK: What are you timing me with a stop watch ? Why do n't you pick on Lexi for a change ?
LEXI: 'Cause I 'm perfect .
ROBERTA: Be careful . Lexi mouths `` be careful '' along with her .
LEXI: I 'm gon na be leaving pretty soon .
HENRY: Just wan na take it for a spin .
LAWRENCE: C'mon , Henry he do n't want to loan you his bike .
HENRY: I did n't hear him say that . Is that true ? Did you say that ?
ROBERTA: Vibrato do n't wiggle your wrist . Rachel stops , frustrated .
RACHEL: Dang ! I ca n't get that right .
ROBERTA: You almost have it .
RACHEL: Almost is n't good enough .
ROBERTA: Did I turn you into such a perfectionist ?
RACHEL: No . I came that way .
ROBERTA: Just as long as you get it right fo your Julliard audition .
RACHEL: What ?
ROBERTA: I 've recommended you for a gifted kids scholarship . Rachel looks at her in wide-eyed gratitude .
LEXI: Mom , please . Do n't do this to me !
NICK: C'mon , Mom why do n't you let me handle this ?
ROBERTA: Are we getting closer , Lawrence ?
LAWRENCE: It 's the next block up .
LEXI: You do n't have to do this . I 'll pay you back .
ROBERTA: How ? It took me six months to save up for it .
NICK: I 'll help him , O.K. ? We 'll both pay you back .
LEXI: Or we 'll ask Dad he 'll help us out .
ROBERTA: Yeah , right .
LAWRENCE: O.K. , slow down . It 's the second one on the right .
NICK: C'mon Mom , let 's get out of here .
ROBERTA: Lock the doors .
LEXI: I 'm dead . She 's gon na get me killed .
NICK: I 'm coming with you !
ROBERTA: No . Get back in the car and stay with the boys .
LAWRENCE: Do n't take the stairs !
ROBERTA: I 'm a school teacher . Henry has taken my son 's bicycle and I want it back .
OLD WOMAN: Henry 's not here .
ROBERTA: Well you tell Henry that if he returns the bike , I wo n't have to notify the police or his school principal . Although since I am a teacher , it would be very easy for me to do that . A couple of beats .
OLD WOMAN: He 's not home . He does n't get home till late .
ROBERTA: How late ?
OLD WOMAN: Not till after ten .
ROBERTA: I 'll be on the steps of CPE 1 at 11 P.M . I 'll be waiting for him .
LEXI: You 're crazy . He 's not gon na show . Roberta sits confidently .
NICK: You think he actually cares that you 're a teacher ? You think he even goes to school ?
LEXI: C'mon , Mom let 's just go .
ROBERTA: It 's only five after eleven .
HENRY: I was just borrowing it . He glances at Roberta , then walks off .
ROBERTA: Shandra Wilson .
LEONARD: It 's too hard ! I do n't wan na do it !
ISABEL: Do n't you even wan na try , Leonard ?
LEONARD: I do n't want to ! Isabel looks at Roberta .
ROBERTA: Well , O.K . then . I 'll pick someone else . Ramon Olivas . Ramon 's face lights up .
RAMON: This is to inform you that your child , Ramon Olivas , has been chosen by lottery to be in the violin program .
CONCEPCION: You happy ?
ROBERTA: No . But I keep trying . And maybe someday the school will give me a parking space !
DOROTHEA: Wait
DOROTHEA: Those copies are for you .
ROBERTA: Thank you . Can I pay for you them ?
DOROTHEA: Do n't be silly . Besides you 'll need your money for parking tickets . They smile at each other .
ROBERTA: What 's his name ?
DOROTHEA: Arnold Steinhardt .
ROBERTA: Of the Guarneri String Quartet ? Dorothea nods , and hands Roberta a card .
DOROTHEA: Stay in touch . Let us know when the kids have a concert .
RACHEL: Do n't be late for violin class ! I hear the teacher 's really mean .
ROBERTA: Amanda , what did I tell you about wearing cowboy boots to violin class ? They 're too slippery !
CARLOS: It 's coming . He nervously looks down the hall .
ROBERTA: What , is it walking here by itself ?
CARLOS: Look , it 's just not cool . You would n't understand .
ROBERTA: Hey , you want your sister to carry your violin , that 's fine . But is she practicing for you too ? Because lately , that 's how it sounds .
CARLOS: I 've been busy ! I 've been
ROBERTA: I 'm not interested ! Just get here on time , and commit to this class or I do n't want you in here , you understand ? He nods sullenly .
MANUELO: Why did n't you show it to me ?
CONCEPCION: It just needed one parent 's signature .
MANUELO: Well , I 'm his parent and I do n't give permission ! He should be playing aseball , not the violin !
CONCEPCION: It makes him happy .
BOY #1: Ooh , check out little Miss Violinhead .
GIRL: She carry that violin with her all the time 'cause she think she special . Rachel turns to them .
RACHEL: I am special .
ROBERTA: And ?
RACHEL: They said yes ! Roberta gives her a big hug .
ROBERTA: So when you take the violins home , tape your music to the wall directly in front of your nose so you can play with perfect posture . You parents are gon na be so excited to hear you play !
PEDRO: Ramon ! How many cats you killing in there ?
ROBERTA: More bow ! To the frog ! Myesha , you stop sign line should be touching . Do n't let it wiggle ! You 're on the wrong string , Justin ! And look at your feet !
VANESSA: I forgot .
ROBERTA: Goodbye ! And you may be dropped .
RAMON: Drop dead , Justin !
JUSTIN: It was a accident !
RAMON: Was not !
ROBERTA: Ramon , I do n't like that kind of talk . Justin , pick up his stand , now ! Our spring concert is in three weeks and you might not be in it . Is that what you want ?
MR. KLEIN: She 's going back and forth between houses . My wife and I split up .
ROBERTA: Oh . I 'm sorry . Roberta leans into the car window .
VANESSA: The tape does n't stick .
ROBERTA: What ?
VANESSA: I taped the music to the wall at my Mom 's house and then I took it to my Dad 's house and it does n't stick anymore .
ROBERTA: Well you know what ? That 's an easy problem to solve .
RAMON: You wan na hear my new song , Papa ?
MANUELO: Not right now .
CONCEPCION: We made mistakes with Pedro and Ernesto and we ca n't fix them now , ut Ramon he works so hard . The violin makes him want to be good at everything .
ROBERTA: What happened ?
RAMON: You go to heaven You go to hell You go to hell heaven
TOUSSAINT: My grandpa died and my uncle , so that makes six .
SHANDRA: I know more than that . At least seven people maybe even nine .
ROBERTA: I know that you 've all heard the bad news about Justin .
MYESHA: I did n't hear .
TOUSSAINT: There was a drive-by shooting by his house and he got shot on accident and he died . Myesha takes this in , looking sad .
ROBERTA: Does anyone want to talk about it ?
RAMON: I think we should just play violin . Roberta watches him .
CONCEPCION: Roberta ! Come in . Roberta enters .
ROBERTA: I came by to check on Ramon .
CONCEPCION: Why ?
ROBERTA: Did n't he tell you what happened at school ? Concepcion shakes her head no .
CONCEPCION: Roberta wants to talk to you , O.K . ?
RAMON: Did that sound O.K . ?
ROBERTA: Yeah , it did . Ramon smiles , pleased with himself .
RAMON: Yeah . You got very strict with him .
ROBERTA: It was n't always so easy to be nice to him , you know ? Ramon looks away from her , upset .
RAMON: You think Justin 's in heaven or hell ?
ROBERTA: Heaven . Ramon runs his fingers along his bow .
RAMON: I told him to drop dead . Roberta touches Ramon 's back .
ROBERTA: Justin did n't die because of what you said . I promise .
RAMON: How do you know ?
ROBERTA: I do n't think you 're that powerful , do you ? I mean , if you had such powers , just imagine what kind of violin player you 'd be by now !
RAMON: Yeah . I 'd be better than you !
ROBERTA: It 's O.K . to cry , you know .
RAMON: Not for a man .
ROBERTA: My boys still cry and they 're big , strong young men now . I bet Justin 's daddy cried .
NICK: We were just trying to help !
ROBERTA: This is humiliating !
NICK: Mom , no one knows it 's you ! I mean , you do n't even have to read them if you do n't want to . Although obviously , a lot of guys are interested in dating you .
ROBERTA: No . A lot of guys are interested in dating you and Lexi . What did you say about me , anyway ? They thought she 'd never ask .
NICK: `` Beautiful musician , late 40 's , tired of playing solo
LEXI: seeks a healthy , stable , attractive man who 's not afraid of a duet with a strong , independent woman .
NICK: My violin playing will feed you soul
LEXI: And my lasagna will be music to your palate . ''
ROBERTA: Oh , my God .
LEXI: Did you catch all the music metaphors ?
ROBERTA: Do n't you think it 's a little weird that you 're trying to get your mothe a date ?
NICK: Do n't you think it 's a little weird that you 're not even interested in dating ?
ROBERTA: Boys , look . Number one even if I wanted to date , I do n't have time . And number two I 've got my teaching , I 've got you guys that 's all I need .
LEXI: I really thought she 'd like the music metaphors .
ROBERTA: I think you 're flat , Nick .
NICK: I 'm not flat .
ROBERTA: The B sounded flat .
NICK: Just play the violin , Mom . I 'll take care of the cello . They play for a few beats .
LEXI: You nervous , Mom ?
ROBERTA: No . I 'm fine .
DAN: Hi . I 'm Dan Paxton . Lexi shows him in .
ROBERTA: Honest ?
DAN: Your ad . When you said you were eautiful , you were telling the truth .
NICK: Make sure you 're home by midnight , young lady .
LEXI: Ten bucks he tries to kiss her .
NICK: That 's a no-brainer . Of course he 'll try . The real question is whethe she 'll let him .
LEXI: O.K . ten bucks she lets him .
NICK: You 're on . They stare out the window intently .
DAN: I had a lot of fun tonight .
ROBERTA: Yeah , I did too .
DAN: I have a confession I 've neve answered an ad before . I did it on a dare .
ROBERTA: Well , I have a confession my boys placed the ad behind my back .
DAN: Does this mean I do n't get any lasagna ? Roberta cracks up . Dan smiles at her .
ROBERTA: Why are you guys still up ?
NICK: Why ? Is it late ?
ROBERTA: Good try , Nick .
LEXI: So how was it ?
ROBERTA: Well he 's nice .
NICK: `` Nice '' ? As in `` let 's just be friends '' nice ?
ROBERTA: I do n't know yet . We 'll see . Nick looks disappointed .
NICK: There 's still a lot more letters .
ROBERTA: Good night , Nick . She starts heading upstairs .
LEXI: Hey , Mom can you loan me ten dollars ?
ROBERTA: Guys , I 'm so sorry I got stuck over at CPE 2
RAMON: We heard you got fired .
ROBERTA: What ? !
JANET: Why do n't you come in my office ?
ROBERTA: It 's true ? You 're firing me ?
JANET: It 's not me , Roberta . The Board of Ed . cut the budget , the District had to comply , and as of the end of this term , the violin program has been excessed .
ROBERTA: Excessed . They specifically said that my violin program has to go .
JANET: They 've slashed the budget music and art programs got hit the worst .
ROBERTA: What about Dennis ' classes ?
DENNIS: I 'm tenured , Roberta . Roberta looks at him , then back to Janet .
ROBERTA: When was this decided ?
JANET: Things happened very quickly I wanted to tell you myself
ROBERTA: I just I ca n't even believe this is happening !
DENNIS: Why not ? You 're a sub . Your position has never been permanent .
JANET: Shut up , Dennis ! You 're not helping ! Come into my office , please .
ROBERTA: There 's got ta be a way to fight this !
JANET: Fight it with what ? I do n't have any other extra programs to give them instead .
ROBERTA: Oh , I see . So after ten years , afte fourteen hundred children have learned to play the violin , this is just an `` extra program . ''
JANET: You know I do n't feel that way and you know damn well I 've been standing y you all these years ! You think I have n't noticed what you 've done fo these kids ?
ROBERTA: Then do something !
JANET: I 've been on this phone for the past three days trying to `` do something '' the District office ca n't even stand the sound of my voice . Believe me , there are some people around here I 'd much rather get rid of . But as far as the Board 's concerned , violin classes are not a priority .
ROBERTA: sitting at the kitchen table with a glass of wine , her face ashen .
NICK: What happened ?
ROBERTA: I 'm a good teacher . I 've worked so hard to give these kids something to e proud of . Lexi moves to comfort her .
LEXI: I 'm so sorry , Mom . I ca n't believe they did this to you .
ROBERTA: It 's like when my father got killed . For twenty years , he followed every safety rule the factory had , and then someone else flips the wrong switch It 's not fair . You do everything ight and then
NICK: It 's the wrong analogy . You could n't do anything about Grandpa 's death . It was irreversible . This is n't .
ROBERTA: Tell that to the Board of Education .
NICK: Let me ask you something . Why did you risk your life for a bicycle ?
ROBERTA: I did not risk my life .
NICK: Of course you did ! That building ? Threatening Henry ? And for what two hundred dollars ?
ROBERTA: No . Not for that .
LEXI: Then why ?
ROBERTA: When someone steals something that elongs to my kids , I 'm not gon na sit back and let that happen !
LEXI: Yeah , but is that where you really want to be ?
ROBERTA: The beautiful concert that you just heard could be the last concert of the East Harlem Violin Program . The Board of Education and the District Superintendent do n't think that music is important for our children . But they 're wrong and they 're in fo a fight .
JANET: Hello , Assunta . How are you ?
ASSUNTA: I 'd be a lot better if my daughte had a job next year .
ROBERTA: Ma !
JANET: I would too .
ROBERTA: Mama , why do n't you take Allegra out for a walk ?
JANET: You are having a meeting here tonight , ight ? Parents and teachers ?
ROBERTA: Well , yes , but
JANET: Take it from me . If you want to get parents to help you with something , you have to feed them . She holds up two wedges of cheese .
ROBERTA: Well , no I
JANET: Good . Because take it from me my own family begs me to stay out of the kitchen .
ROBERTA: What I did n't expect was for you to e here .
JANET: Why not ? We 've got ta figure out a way to fight this . After ten years , Roberta , I ca n't imagine walking through those hallways and not hearing that off-key , screechy , scratchy , nails-on-the- lackboard violin music . Roberta smiles . Janet holds up a baguette .
ROBERTA: Let 's cut it now . It 'll be less messy .
ISABEL: Do n't they realize how much this program helps the kids ?
MR. ADAMS: Simon 's our third child to study with Roberta . James is pre-med , April 's valedictorian now that says something !
MR. KLEIN: I think we should inundate the Board and the District with letters .
JANET: You 're wasting your time . The Board and the District are not gon na pay for this program , no matter how many letters they get . Disappointed grumblings .
ISABEL: What if we raise the money ourselves ?
JANET: I ca n't see how they 'd object to that . A beat as people take this in .
CONCEPCION: Well once that newspaper article comes out , that should help bring in money .
BEVERLY: Yeah , but what if it does n't ? Fo all we know , it 's gon na be buried on the back page . Besides , who says anyone 's gon na give a damn about ou kids ?
DOROTHEA: What if you do a benefit concert ? We can raise a batch of money from ticket sales , and then the concert itself could be great publicity . There 's word of mouth you could get eviewed
ROBERTA: It better be a good concert !
DOROTHEA: I 'm sure I could persuade him with a little pillow talk . And maybe he can get another violinist too Itzhak Perlman , perhaps . This gets people 's attention .
ROBERTA: That would be fantastic .
DOROTHEA: We could rent a place like the 92nd Street Y it 's perfect for this . It seats about nine hundred people and if we charge between fifty and a hundred a ticket
ISABEL: We could probably raise enough to einstate your program for a year .
JANET: Sounds like a plan .
ROBERTA: It better be a good concert .
DAN: Take your pick .
ROBERTA: Kids , listen to me it 's really important that you do n't look at the camera and you try to act as natural as possible . Dennis storms in .
DENNIS: Who authorized this ?
ROBERTA: Janet .
DENNIS: Well Janet 's not here today and I want these people out of here .
ROBERTA: Why are you doing this ? We 're not othering anyone .
DENNIS: You 're disrupting school and I want them out of here now .
ROBERTA: You still do n't get it , do you ? I do n't care if you hate me , Dennis that 's your business . But think about the students for once . Every time you interfere , you 're not hurting me you 're hurting them .
DENNIS: Get these people out of here or I 'm calling the police .
ROBERTA: Go right ahead , call them . That 'll look real good on the eleven o'clock news .
RAMON: I do n't hear no sirens .
ROBERTA: I 'm from a blue collar family , and if it were n't for the lessons I got in public school , I never would have learned the violin .
SHANDRA: It makes us sad !
RAMON: Yeah , like we 're never gon na have no more violin lessons
VANESSA: And it 's bad because because we love violin class .
ROBERTA: Yes , I 've gotten offers from two private schools , but this is where I want to be .
ARNOLD: Did n't we send them a donation ?
DOROTHEA: They need something bigger . And you ca n't just write a check you have to get involved .
ARNOLD: Involved how ?
ROBERTA: Listen up , everyone ! Quiet down ! The students give her their attention .
RAMON: Bach 's `` Minuet One '' ?
ROBERTA: People are gon na be paying good money for this concert we 're not just gon na play `` Twinkle . '' I 'm passing out a contract that you and your parents need to sign .
CARLOS: Every Saturday and Sunday ?
ROBERTA: Plus night time rehearsals during the week . There 's only six weeks till the concert , so classes in school wo n't be enough . The kids look sobered by this .
DE SEAN: Take it from me this lady do n't lie . Y'all are gon na work your butts off .
TEAMMATE #1: Hey Carlos ! Where ya goin ' ? We got a game , remember ?
CARLOS: Yeah , I know , but I ca n't make it .
TEAMMATE #1: What you talkin ' about ?
CARLOS: I just ca n't make it .
TEAMMATE #2: You got a date with the violin teacher ? A beat .
CARLOS: Yeah . I do .
ROBERTA: Frog ! Frog ! I need more accents on the down beat ! More bow ! More !
CARLOS: How can we practice ? We 're rehearsing all the time . Some kids laugh , including Stephanie .
ROBERTA: You think this is funny , Stephanie ? You think the four hundred people who 've bought tickets so far will think it 's funny too ? You think Itzhak Perlman will think it 's funny that he 's donating his time and you 're all gon na stink ? Vanessa yawns and Roberta sees her . Uh-oh .
VANESSA: No . It 's 7 30 in the morning . I 'm just tired .
ROBERTA: There 's no time to be tired . Let 's try it again .
DOROTHEA: There 's more bad news We 've lost the Y. Roberta looks at her , aghast .
ROBERTA: What ? !
DOROTHEA: They had a flood a water heate urst The concert hall was damaged and they 've cancelled all events .
ROBERTA: Until when ?
DOROTHEA: `` Until further notice . ''
ROBERTA: This ca n't happen ! We 've sold tickets ! We 've done publicity ! The concert 's in three weeks !
DOROTHEA: I 've been on the phone all morning calling other theaters . Nothing 's available .
ROBERTA: Just keep looking .
VANESSA: Maybe 'cause we do n't have a place for the concert .
ROBERTA: Well , you 're right . This might all e for nothing . So we can eithe keep on rehearsing in case we find a place or we can just give up .
DE SEAN: Am I hearing right ? Did you use the words `` give up '' ? Let 's take a vote . How many of you want to give up ? No one raises a hand . Roberta takes this in .
GUADALUPE: See ? You taught us well .
ROBERTA: What about in the Bronx ?
NICK: There 's nothing . Why do n't you just do it in one of the schools ? It 'll be a lot smalle ut
ROBERTA: We wo n't make enough money .
LEXI: What about postponing it ?
ROBERTA: Itzhak and Arnold are booked all summer .
DOROTHEA: I have good news really good news . Arnold got a call from his friend Wally Scheur who heard about us losing the Y and wanted to see how he could help and then Wally had this illiant idea and called his friend Isaac Stern and it 's all arranged ! We have a new place for Fiddlefest !
ROBERTA: Where ?
DOROTHEA: Carnegie Hall .
ROBERTA: Carnegie Hall ?
ISAAC STERN: You must be Roberta .
ROBERTA: Thank you so much for helping us .
ISAAC STERN: Would you believe in 1960 , they tried to tear this place down ? They wanted to replace it with a bright red skyscraper we called it `` the red terror . ''
ROBERTA: You 're kidding .
ISAAC STERN: We had to fight like hell , but with a lot of help , we saved Carnegie Hall .
ROBERTA: Yes , of course ! That would be great ! Isaac nods , then touches her shoulder .
ISAAC STERN: Do n't give up .
ROBERTA: I just do n't see how I 'm gon na do this . It 's huge . It 's gigantic ! It 's Carnegie Hall ! And listen to this now Isaac Stern wants to play with us Diane Monroe , Michael Tree there 's other people calling
DAN: That 's fantastic !
ROBERTA: Fantastic ? I 'll never get the kids up to speed in time , I 'll never get myself up to speed . I 'm gon na be playing side by side with the world 's greatest violinists .
DAN: And `` the world 's greatest violinists '' are playing side by side with you ecause they want to help you win this fight .
ROBERTA: Yes , but you do n't understand . Maybe there 's a good reason why I never made it as a violinist maybe I just ca n't cut it . I keep blaming it on not having enough early training , but if I were talented , if I had a gift
DAN: But you do have a gift . You 're gon na put thirty East Harlem kids on stage at Carnegie Hall not because they 're prodigies , but because you got them to stick with something that 's hard as hell and to strive for excellence which , by the way , I certainly was n't striving for when I was their age . Not to mention the other ten years ' worth of students whose lives were changed because of you . That 's you talent , Roberta .
ROBERTA: I 'm scared .
DAN: I know . And by the way , I happen to think you 're a pretty good violinist too .
ROBERTA: You 've barely heard me play .
DAN: I 've heard enough to know you 're gon na do just fine .
CARLOS: Teacher 's late . I think she should e dropped , do n't you ? Kids laugh .
RAMON: Yeah . I do n't think we should let her play in Fiddlefest !
CARLOS: More bow ! To the frog ! You sound terrible ! I ca n't believe how terrible you sound !
ROBERTA: If you 're gon na imitate me , do it ight . Shoulders back . Violin higher . Check your feet . There . G'head , Carlos . Continue . Carlos freezes .
CARLOS: No , that 's O.K . You can take it from here .
ROBERTA: He 's right , by the way . You do sound terrible , and you are gon na make everyone in Carnegie Hall sick to their stomachs .
RACHEL: I need to talk to you . Roberta sees how distressed Rachel looks .
ROBERTA: I 'll be right in . Start on Minuet One . What 's wrong ?
RACHEL: We 're moving away .
ROBERTA: What ? Where are you moving ?
RACHEL: It 's a secret My father he 's een hurting my mom We have to leave .
ROBERTA: Has he been hurting you too ?
RACHEL: I 'm sorry about Julliard and the concert . She hands Roberta her violin .
ROBERTA: Keep it . Take it with you .
RACHEL: No I do n't want to play anymore .
ROBERTA: What ? ! You ca n't give up violin , Rachel it 's a part of you . A very important part .
RACHEL: I do n't want to .
ROBERTA: No , no , no ! Accent the up bow afte the slurred notes and then it 'll get you off of those slurred notes ! You Double Concerto kids need to be working harder ! This is the grand finale of the concert ! You 're each gon na be sharing a music stand with one of the world 's greatest violinists !
VANESSA: No ! We can do it , Roberta !
CARLOS: And we 'll get the Bach Double . We will . She stops , takes a breath .
NAEEM: It 's gon na be O.K. , Roberta .
ROBERTA: You think ? All the kids nod . A few beats .
NICK: Yes , Mom .
ROBERTA: Lexi , can you make sure the charts are still in my bag ?
LEXI: I already checked , Mom .
ASSUNTA: Bert , which earrings you want ?
ROBERTA: Nick ? Get two more violins .
NICK: You 've already got two how many emergencies can there be ? A beat .
ROBERTA: Get three more . And make sure a couple of them are half-size .
LEXI: Mom , they 're not gon na forget to send a car !
NICK: What are you doing ?
ROBERTA: Just straightening a little .
NICK: You 're insane , you know that ? Finish getting dressed !
ROBERTA: Can you believe this ?
ASSUNTA: I 'll sew it in the car .
LEXI: See ? I told you they 'd send a car .
ROBERTA: Thank you , Mama .
ASSUNTA: Do n't worry about it . You rip I sew .
ROBERTA: Not just for that . Thank you for getting me out of bed . Assunta stitches , remembering , and smiles .
ASSUNTA: Do n't thank me thank Charles .
ROBERTA: Charles ? !
ASSUNTA: If that jerk had n't of left you , none of this would 've happened . Roberta contemplates this . A beat .
ROBERTA: Thank you , Charles .
JANET: I 'll call her house .
BRIAN: Congratulations .
ROBERTA: Thank you
BRIAN: I knew you 'd get here sooner or later . I 'm glad I 'm here to see it . A beat .
ROBERTA: I am too .
GUADALUPE: Excuse me , Mr. Perlman ? He turns around .
ITZHAK PERLMAN: A pleasure to meet you , Guadalupe .
CARLOS: You nervous , Mr. Perlman ?
ITZHAK PERLMAN: Should I be ?
CARLOS: Us kids are gon na be great I do n't know about you guys . How much did you practice ? Itzhak Perlman laughs .
ROBERTA: You called Vanessa 's father and mother ?
JANET: No answer at either .
STAFF PERSON: Half hour call ! It 's now half hou call ! So pace yourself accordingly . Do n't get more than thirty minutes worth of nervous ! The room electrifies with nerves .
MR. KLEIN: With the violin .
ROBERTA: Oh my God . Nick , Lexi
NICK: Done .
VANESSA: And then when we were getting a taxi , I fell down . Roberta comforts her and Janet moves in .
JANET: C'mon honey let 's get you cleaned up .
DAN: You 're glowing .
ROBERTA: It 's terror .
JANET: When I became the principal of Central Park East Elementary , I envisioned a school where children could fulfill their highest potential , despite the challenges of poverty and racism . Ten years ago , Roberta Guaspari walked into my office because she needed a job , and because she had a vision that any child could learn the violin . We put our dreams together and created the East Harlem Violin Program which has helped more than a thousand students expand their vision of what 's possible in their lives . When a program like this is cut , ou children 's future is compromised . I want to thank you for your support . Enjoy the concert .
ROBERTA: Everyone attention please ! They become quiet .
BOY: The frog hair ? Roberta and the kids laugh .
ROBERTA: Did you ever see a frog with hair ? The boy smiles and shakes his head .
GIRL: Ooh ! I know !
ROBERTA: Sssh let him answer .

ANDY: What what is going on now ?

ANDY: One shot ! I ca n't believe this .
KAREN: She needs to go get Strohbecker 's face . Andy claps his hands .
KAREN: We 'll wait for you here .
ANDY: Karen , she 's got her own car . Billy explains something in sign language .
KAREN: Okay . Okay . Do n't forget tonight .
ANDY: Well , try and stay awake .
KAREN: It could 've been Billy . ANDY I was thinking about dinner .

LARSEN: Big cowboy . A little later .

ANDY: What 's the matter ?
LARSEN: Big cowboy .
KAREN: Guys , could we get out of here , please ?
ANDY: The expression ?
CAPTAIN: A variation on our squid ink isotto . Trace of Moselle , to sweeten the stock .
JULIANNE: I 'm writing it up as inventive and confident . Which it is . Off the ecord , I 'll need an extra boat of the ink . Or a salt shaker .
CAPTAIN: I 'll toss a coin .
DIGGER: Is it ever embarrassing , having your bum kissed in public ?
JULIANNE: If your ass is n't chapped , you are not a good-writer of note .
DIGGER: I 've adjusted , and thanks for asking .
JULIANNE: See the pull of a book like Twenty Chefs , is not who I put in . It 's who I leave out .
DIGGER: Which is everyone you could n't get in .
JULIANNE: Plus some guys whose food I do n't like .
DIGGER: This fellow from Newsday eve call ?
JULIANNE: I 'll buzz my machine . Inventive and confident , yeh ? She dials . He tastes .
DIGGER: Needs salt .
JULIANNE: Is Newsday a real interview , o just some cute guy you 're setting me up w
DIGGER: I do n't send you men , anymore . You do n't know what to do with them . She 's punching in her code .
JULIANNE: Sometimes I do . Like for two months .
DIGGER: weeks .
JULIANNE: No , no , the opposite . That 's my best friend , Michael O'Neal . He sounds desperate to talk .
DIGGER: The wandering sportswriter . He pushes the risotto back her way .
JULIANNE: Sophomore year at Yale we had this one hot month . And , you know me , I got restless He knows her . She got restless .
DIGGER: Kindred spirits .
JULIANNE: No , he 's nothing like me . He 's like you . Only straight . No offense taken .
DIGGER: He 's still in love with you . That stops her . She has to say
JULIANNE: Maybe . But it never gets in the way .
DIGGER: Well , he has a true friend in you . He wants her to know he sees that .
JULIANNE: Solid and genuine is not boring . Michael can be completely insane
DIGGER: I 've lost interest .
JULIANNE: He takes a razor from his dinky little dopp kit , cuts his fingertip , takes my hand , does the same to me
DIGGER: Blood oath .
JULIANNE: He says , `` Swear . When we 're both 28 , if we 've never been married we marry each other ! ''
DIGGER: You 'll be 28 in three weeks . How old is he ?
JULIANNE: You think
DIGGER: Desperate . To talk .
JULIANNE: He 's not proposing marriage , there 's no way I 'm buying one word of th
DIGGER: Then why are you compulsively eating ? If you 're not hysterical ?
JULIANNE: He ca n't do that to me !
DIGGER: We 're about to find out .
JULIANNE: When I turn him down She realizes the full weight of the truth .
DIGGER: I have a suggestion
JULIANNE: I 'll have to kill myself before I call him . Staring in each other 's eyes . DIGGER That was it .
DIGGER: You ca n't get lung cancer and die in four days . Go to Plan B . She sucks deep . Really deep .
JULIANNE: You have no appropriate sense of emergency . My best friend is ruining his life .
DIGGER: No , he 's ruining yours .
JULIANNE: Same difference . If you love someone , it 's your duty to save them from themselves .
DIGGER: You have a real philosophy of life .
JULIANNE: It 's called the Law of Love , asshole .
DIGGER: I can see why .
JULIANNE: She knows him maybe five seconds , plus she has billions of dollars , plus she 's perfect , so do n't go feeling sorry for Miss Pre-Teen Illinois !
KIMMY: This just makes everything so perfect .
JULIANNE: Well , we 're
KIMMY: I think the best part of marrying this guy is finding you . Pale gray eyes . Alive with joy and intimacy .
JULIANNE: You need a few dollars .
KIMMY: Dry . Just like he said . Her eyes at once admiring and regretful .
JULIANNE: Excuse me ?
KIMMY: I can be quick . I can even e funny . Shakes her head . An endearing youngster .
JULIANNE: Can you watch the road ?
KIMMY: See . Dry . It 's in the delivery . She looks back to the highway .
JULIANNE: you want a menage on you wedding night . KIMMY No , that would n't be burdensome .
KIMMY: My classmate Angelique shattered her pelvis line dancing in Abeline on Spring Break . Looks over . The sweetest smile .
JULIANNE: Uh . How about promoting a idesmaid ? Someone you know for at least forty-five minutes .
KIMMY: The bridesmaids are my only two female relatives under forty . Identical twin debutantes from Nashville , who are basically vengeful sluts . With amazing odies !
JULIANNE: Which was the disqualifying factor ?
KIMMY: The twin part . I like to remain impartial in my contempt .
JULIANNE: I thought bridesmaids had to wea the same dress .
KIMMY: Not you . You wo n't be comfortable unless you 're distinctive . Julianne glances over .
JULIANNE: What else did he tell you
KIMMY: you hate weddings , you never go . Oh . Well , yeah .
JULIANNE: That 's why Michael and I were the wrong fit . Right from the start .
KIMMY: He said that , too .
JULIANNE: I need a smoke .
KIMMY: It 's mostly the seam . Let 's get this to Carlos .
JULIANNE: Do n't you have to be somewh
KIMMY: just my bridal shower . And Michael has to meet our dads and the groomsmen at Comiskey for a one-thirty game . Opens the door
JULIANNE: Come in , and shut the
MICHAEL: We 've seen each other a lot more naked than this .
JULIANNE: Things are different now .
MICHAEL: Mirrors .
JULIANNE: luckiest guy in the Northern Fucking Hemisphere , is all I 'm s
KIMMY: What ? Because I 'm a little understand
JULIANNE: most sentimental schmucks I pity want a honeymoon after thei wedding . Just to top it off . The valet gives Kimmy her ticket .
KIMMY: I ca n't expect the NBA to hold up the playoffs
JULIANNE: So your honeymoon is exactly where ? Well
KIMMY: It depends . If San Antonio sweeps Sacramento , we could start there . Or Phoenix . Or depending on Indiana- Clevel
JULIANNE: garden sports , all . Little swing of maybe fifty degrees Fahrenheit , epresents a packing challenge , but there 's fine food and cocktails at a choice of Embassy Suit At the elevator . Kimmy SLAMS the button .
KIMMY: It 's his career , I 'm supportive . Look , I 've been everywhere , I 've seen the world , I 've laid on a beach . I want to be with the man I love . That 's what makes it a honeymoon . End of story . Okay ?
JULIANNE: I 'm just saying he 's lucky . An empty elevator arrives . They get in .
KIMMY: his snoring , yeah . He says it 's worse than ever . That snaffle one ?
JULIANNE: How about
KIMMY: cigars in bed ? I broke him on that . But the bathroom 's a swamp , he wears Reeboks to dinner , tells the same , admittedly funny , jokes three hundred times Sucks in a breath
JULIANNE: A trademark move , do n't touch it .
KIMMY: But he sure can kiss .
JULIANNE: It 's been awhile . I 'll take your word .
KIMMY: After two weeks of cataloguing all his faults , I made a command decision that changed my life .
JULIANNE: Do you get nervous in small confined spaces ?
KIMMY: So it 's sweet of you to be protective
JULIANNE: Let me rephrase that
KIMMY: But nothing ever could , eve did , give me a moment 's pause about this marriage
JULIANNE: Do you get hysterical in small confined spa
KIMMY: except one . Julianne 's face . Stops .
JULIANNE: Oh , yeah ? Kimmy nods . Confides
KIMMY: You . A stopper .
JULIANNE: Well , perfection can get wearing after whi
KIMMY: I 'm not joking . I had to face up to all my competitive drives , and believe me , I 've got 'em .
JULIANNE: No .
KIMMY: And the answer was so simple .
JULIANNE: I was gon na predict that .
KIMMY: You win . Julianne blinks . Excuse me ?
JULIANNE: I 've missed a step .
KIMMY: He has you on a pedestal . And me in his arms .
JULIANNE: Jesus , we 're trapped !
KIMMY: Ju
JULIANNE: No , this happened to me once , almost , it was excruciating !
MANDY: Mah Gawd , it 's the bride , and the woman she 'll nevah live up to ! KIMMY That would be us .
SAMMY: Did she say th ' wrong thang agin ? It is so in character !
JULIANNE: I 'm Julianne Potter , and
SAMMY: we 'd be the vengeful sluts . We came in complementary colors .
MANDY: Have you sized up the groomsmen , Jules ? As M. of H. , you get first fuck . Do n't pick the short , hairy , rich one .
JULIANNE: unless he has a hump .
ISABELLE: I 'm Isabelle Wallace , and my handsome new son scarcely did you justice , girl .
JULIANNE: Desperate measures ! Do you hear me ? Digger , are you the SQUAWK . Static . Then
MICHAEL: Wow ! Lem me give you a ha JULIANNE Michael . You 'll unwittingly imply that I 'm clumsy . He stops in his tracks . The guys whistle .
BODYGUARD: Sorry , ma'am , I 'm on duty . JULIANNE It 's Miss . And thanks . That leaves two for me . Heads down the row
MICHAEL: Julianne Potter , this is Hank and Gerry from SI , and you know Daniel
WALTER: If he gives you grief , I 'll have him skillfully beaten , where the wounds wo n't show .
JULIANNE: I guess getting him whacked would e politically out of the question .
WALTER: Under the circumstances . Charmed to know you , Jules .
JULIANNE: Nice meeting you , too , Walt . A nod between equals . She moves on
MICHAEL: And , this guy , you know
JULIANNE: Papa Joe .
JOE: You gon na be my boy 's best man ? Despite SHOUTS from the others
JULIANNE: Best everything , Joe . But I 'm going to dance with you .
MICHAEL: Dance ? You do n't dance ! You learn to dance ? ? Her innocent smile .
JULIANNE: Moves . You 've never seen .
MICHAEL: You 're an impostor ! What have you done with my best friend ? As he takes away the remaining beers
JULIANNE: I just admire your maturity , that 's all . I mean , there are people who would find that kind of perfection boring . Day after day , year after year
MICHAEL: see , that 's what I thought at first . How can you like someone that perfect ? No potential fo long-range livability .
JULIANNE: Such as .
MICHAEL: She 's too genuine .
JULIANNE: Hate that .
MICHAEL: How can you trust someone you can never mistrust ?
JULIANNE: What 's next ? Keep sipping . Never look at each other .
MICHAEL: No matter how many times I leave the toilet seat up , she forgets and puts it down .
JULIANNE: Endearingly absent-minded .
MICHAEL: My very point . Here 's another one Shakes his head . This one really gets him .
JULIANNE: Quite the little eccentric .
MICHAEL: At first , I thought it was a gag , but she 's always done it !
JULIANNE: Is there a coup de grace in here , somewh
MICHAEL: She admires . Tommy Lasorda .
JULIANNE: Waiter ! Check , please !
MICHAEL: She finds him `` personable . ''
JULIANNE: Can that kind of defect be passed on genetically ?
MICHAEL: Then again . She has a few good traits .
JULIANNE: Gim me like , eight and nine off the top ten list
MICHAEL: First girl I ever knew . Who lets me give her a bath .
JULIANNE: Looks like , from here .

MICHAEL: I tried those on . When you were n't looking .
JULIANNE: Where was that , Florence , huh ?
MICHAEL: Firenze . Together in the memory . As Kimmy watches .

MICHAEL: Till the gas ran out . And , the first sniff of left-out
KIMMY: I love Florence .
JULIANNE: Take her there . He nods , okay .

MICHAEL: The El 's right down the street . Unless you 're afraid of the neighborhood .
JULIANNE: No . I 'm always safe with you .
MICHAEL: What , leaving school
JULIANNE: all of it . She 's leaving he family , her friends , everything she knows . She 's putting her caree on hold , and she seems a pretty ambitious , driven , kind of pers MICHAEL In her way .
MICHAEL: She would never . Never . Even think of that .
JULIANNE: I guess you 're right . That would e deceitful manipulative controlling emascula
MICHAEL: I got the point .
JULIANNE: Still . All 's fair in love and w
MICHAEL: That would be a girl . I do n't even know .
JULIANNE: Dig , of course . Of course , of course , of course , of course I have a plan . Certainment !
KIMMY: Anyway , I think you 're wrong . Wrong ?
JULIANNE: Oh , that . I forgot I even said th
KIMMY: I just think you 're wrong , is all .
JULIANNE: Probably am . Forget I brought it up .
KIMMY: I mean , he loves his job .
JULIANNE: Bad games , bad towns , bad pay , bad flights , bad hotels , real bad food . Homeless , rootless , lonely , maybe your copy gets into one issue out of four Smiles .
KIMMY: But he always says
JULIANNE: whatever is manly and independent . Kim nods slowly . Way ahead of her .
KIMMY: That 's just the sort of thing my father and I discussed . Julianne just blinks . Amazed .
JULIANNE: I 'm not stupid . Say , how about this ?
KIMMY: For the twins ? What in the world is th
JULIANNE: Gold nose hair clippers .
KIMMY: So you do n't think Michael 's as happy with his job as Julianne points to a matched pair of large
JULIANNE: Hello . Kim nods , oh . But ca n't keep her mind off
KIMMY: You think he 'd accept ? Hmm ?
JULIANNE: By any yardstick that involves sanity , it would be the greatest thing that ever happened to him . Present company excepted .
KIMMY: So one almost has to
JULIANNE: Exactly .
KIMMY: Exactly what ?
JULIANNE: What you said . Make it appea that he 's doing you the favor .
KIMMY: The very words I 've used .
JULIANNE: We make Dad your co-conspirator . Michael does a favor for Walter . Simple .
KIMMY: He 'll see right through it .
JULIANNE: Only . If he wants to . They share a smile .
KIMMY: He wo n't get mad , huh ?
JULIANNE: Bridesmaid gifts for two , well , assertive , outspoken , Tennessee debutantes . KIMMY He wo n't be mad ? JULIANNE Nothing here seems to quite capture their distinctive personalities .
KIMMY: You do n't think he 'll be mad .
JULIANNE: Your call . You can live a lie . In a fabulous selection of Red Roof Inns . Or you can make one desperate stab at hap
KIMMY: I just do n't want to freak him out .
JULIANNE: How mad could he get ?
MAITRE D': Oh , Mr. Wallace and his guests have retired to the humidor .
JULIANNE: Great . I 've got this girlfriend at the Justice Department ? With all this time on her hands ?

JULIANNE: I like 'em long and hard . Kind of big around . Runs it under her nose .
GUY: I meant . What you 're looking fo in a man .
JULIANNE: Actually , I 'm partial to married gentlemen .
GUY: Why is that ?
JULIANNE: It 's so much time . When I phone the wives .
WALTER: Your idea ?
JULIANNE: I think you 're making a mistake , sir . His eyes come back to her . A little sharply .
WALTER: And that interests me . How someone who knows him so well could be so wrong . A formidable guy . She meets his gaze .
JULIANNE: See , I love him , too , as much as anyone here . And for a whole lot longer . From her heart .
TEENAGER: You do it , girl .
MICHAEL: Wow . What was going on in there ? She shudders .
JULIANNE: Some crazy person .
MICHAEL: You 're not eating .
JULIANNE: I never eat when I 'm serene .
MICHAEL: You never eat when you 're despondent .
JULIANNE: I switched that around when you were n't looking .
MICHAEL: Last zoo we were in was Beijing , yeah ? Sure . The rhinos were fucking .
JULIANNE: Boy , those were the days .
MICHAEL: Yeah , they were .
JULIANNE: That was nice . The way you said that .
MICHAEL: It 's weird being the groom . All these things Kimmy has to take care of
JULIANNE: You need a baby-sitter . That 's what I 'm here for .
MICHAEL: Now , there 's my girl .
JULIANNE: See , I can only do it with eer .
MICHAEL: See , better already .
JULIANNE: Bet you 're glad I 'm here to take care of you . He puts his arm around her .
MICHAEL: Bet I am .
JULIANNE: Is anybody watching ?
WALTER: I hope so . This is all too mysterious to waste on just me .
JULIANNE: I picked up Michael 's messages for him , at our hotel . I stole one
WALTER: Julianne , reading my son-in-law 's mail , is not something
JULIANNE: Sir , this is important ! Have n't you ever in your life cut one corner , to make something important turn out right ? His smile returns . Just a little .
WALTER: Matter of fact , that 's how I got married .
JULIANNE: It 's a fax from Sports Illustrated from Ben Isaacson , Michael 's boss .
WALTER: I know Ben . She opens the paper .
JULIANNE: `` Mike . We still have no answer to our E-mail of Wednesday . Which option do you select ? I do n't mean to rush you , but Personnel needs to tie up the loose ends . ''
WALTER: It does n't say th
JULIANNE: He 's said some things over the past few weeks . Look , this is why I came up with the idea of you offering him a job . He looks up . He 's listening . Closely .
WALTER: And you think he 's kept this to himself .
JULIANNE: He 's too proud to beg for help . And if you wait till this comes out , your offer will be like charity . Completely humiliating .
WALTER: This fax could mean any numbe of things She nods . She knows that .
JULIANNE: Then it could all come out , soone or later . Nobody should be in on this . Just you and me . Or , more correctly , I . She takes the paper back .
BOY: See that woman ?
JULIANNE: You 'll lose your job
BOY: tear my pecker off . Is what she said .
JULIANNE: Help me ! The maid can only blink .
WALTER: Mike . I hate this downsizing
MICHAEL: Sure you 're okay ?
KIMMY: No , it 's , uh a real big favor . He takes her hand , tenderly .
MICHAEL: I wish you 'd just come out with it . I mean why are we waiting for Jules ? She smiles up at him . The best she can .
KIMMY: Moral support .
MICHAEL: Wow and wow . You have a date , after this ?
JULIANNE: Never can tell .
MICHAEL: You make me think of that song , we used to
KIMMY: It 's really my father . Who needs the favor .
MICHAEL: He never mentioned that . Neithe did y
KIMMY: and public relations is a big problem area for him .
MICHAEL: Like family , huh ? So quiet . So cold . She is terrified .
KIMMY: It would only be , maybe , six months ? Or three or four ? It would mean so much to him
MICHAEL: To him . She swallows . Straightens her spine .
KIMMY: And to m
MICHAEL: and you knew about this . Real quiet . Against the noise of this place .
JULIANNE: I think you ought to listen to her , Michael . This is her life , too .
MICHAEL: Well , which is it ?
JULIANNE: Michael ! !
KIMMY: I am honest ! Silence .
MICHAEL: Well , forgive me for screwing up your plans ! He ca n't even believe he 's hearing this .
KIMMY: What is that sup
MICHAEL: And what am I supposed to do with my life , huh ? I am 28 years old ! I work in a low-paying , low-status , zero-respect job which , unfortunately , I happen to fucking love . How inconvenient . Shrugs .
JULIANNE: Michael , it sounds like a wonderful opportun
MICHAEL: Does it , really ? How come you never took some sell-out establishment job ? You had plenty of chances ! Glares in her eyes .
KIMMY: Well , if that 's the way you f
MICHAEL: Damn straight , it 's how I feel ! What 's their wedding gift , a little gold collar that says `` Mikey-poo '' ? Or do I have to change my name to `` Binky '' ? She 's crying now . Real tears on her face .
KIMMY: MICHAEL ! !
JULIANNE: Uh , Kimmy ?
KIMMY: We settled this . And I reneged . That was n't fair . Please , please , take my hand .
JULIANNE: see that 's what I neve counted on ! I never heard of a brilliant moron before !
DIGGER: You stole my line . He touches his face , and she realizes !
JULIANNE: Oh , shit !
DIGGER: Chill . We do n't want your face coming off with it .
JULIANNE: Chill ? Since when do you say ch
DIGGER: When I 'm talking to children . She looks in his eyes . Realizing at last .
JULIANNE: You flew all the way h
DIGGER: I noticed . I 'm on the noon back . We have this thing with George 's family in the Hamptons .
JULIANNE: You 're butting in .
DIGGER: You like her .
JULIANNE: If I did n't have to hate her , I 'd adore her .
DIGGER: Go figure you .
JULIANNE: Because I realized . When I see him say `` I do , '' that knife will e in my heart . And it will be there every
DIGGER: You 've been working on this , huh ?
JULIANNE: and having `` done the right thing '' will only really be comforting , oh , maybe , five , six times . She sets her jaw .
DIGGER: And you believe that .
JULIANNE: Sure .
DIGGER: It 's not his happiness you 're feeling guilty about
JULIANNE: I do n't know the meaning of the word guilt !
DIGGER: Impressive .
JULIANNE: I am breaking her heart in the short un , but doing her a gigantic favor ! She would be miserable tagging along after this insensitive doofus !
DIGGER: The man you love .
JULIANNE: Beyond reason . The feminist warrior will rise up in this kid , and she 'll be standing over his sleeping form with a butche knife , selecting from a short list of body parts !
DIGGER: Someday she 'll thank you .
JULIANNE: Let 's not get carried away .
DIGGER: Jesus . You 're supposed to take your make-up off before you apply the m
JULIANNE: I KNOW THAT ! I WAS DISTRACTED BY GRIEF !
DIGGER: Zit cream ?
JULIANNE: I wish .
DIGGER: Neosporin ?

DIGGER: I give .
JULIANNE: I ca n't even say it . Now . He 's curious .
DIGGER: Considering the circumstances , I 'm not wholly against suicide Huh ?
JULIANNE: How do you know you can touch that plug ? Are you a licensed contractor ?
DIGGER: What do you suggest ?
JULIANNE: Maybe they just seal off this oom . They have others . He 's staring at her . Sweet , but intense .
DIGGER: I did n't mean about that . Oh . Again .
JULIANNE: If I hear the words `` tell the truth , '' or any paraphrase thereof , I dive into the sink and pull you with me . Looking at her . Looking at her .
DIGGER: Let 's go meet Michael . I 'll wait downstairs .
JULIANNE: It 's too late to start over .
MICHAEL: You guys are heartless , my ide picked this out .
JULIANNE: Like I said , dazzling .
DIGGER: Is she going to dress you every day ?
MICHAEL: Yeah , it 's in the contract .
DIGGER: Well , then , I 'll take it up with her .
MICHAEL: I should look different .
DIGGER: You should look like you dressed yourself .
MICHAEL: And I 'm supposed to respect your fashion tips , because you 're what , a New Yorker ?
DIGGER: Something like that . Julianne loves that the boy are getting on .
MICHAEL: Long trip . Pretty nice of you to come .
DIGGER: Well , I 'm close to her . I wanted to meet the one that got away .

DIGGER: Tell him you 're afraid of love . Afraid of needing .
JULIANNE: Needing .
DIGGER: To belong to someone . He touches her hair .
JULIANNE: And what will he do ?
DIGGER: He 'll choose Kim . You 'll stand y her at her wedding . You 'll kiss him good-bye . And you 'll go home .

JULIANNE: Me either . She watches his surprise .
MICHAEL: Boy , I never thought I 'd hear you say that . Can I come ?

MICHAEL: It 's normal to have second thoughts , huh ? To be scared .
JULIANNE: I would n't know . I never had that many first thoughts .
MICHAEL: I mean , you commit to a wedding . And then it seems like this momentum , you know ? You forget you chose it . She nods . Understands .
JULIANNE: I 'll check . I have it on powerbook , these days .
MICHAEL: With each word , your tenderness grows , Tearing my fears apart She holds him closer . Bites her lip .

MICHAEL: If you find her Strange tone . A gentle warning .
JULIANNE: me , yeah . And she likes Tommy Lasorda . Case closed . Looks at her own watch . Shit !
MICHAEL: But if you do get to her first She looks up .
JULIANNE: It 's Jules , you guys have n't had a call from , say , Kimberly , have you ?
BODYGUARD: She would n't confide in me , so I called the house . He sighs . Feels terrible about all this .

THOMAS J: That does n't sound so bad , come on , we 'll never find that streamer .

HARRY: Yeah .
SHELLY: Are you mad at me ?
HARRY: No , why ?
SHELLY: I do n't know , tonight you just seemed a little cool , not opening car doors and
HARRY: Oh , that was Phil , trying to give me advice on dating 70 's women . Look I 'm so out of touch , I have n't dated women in ages , not since my wife died .

MR. BIXLER: Before the class started , Ronda and Justin wanted to lead the class in a group meditation .
WOMAN: Ooooh that 's really cool .
JUSTIN: Okay what we 're gon na do is , send our vibes out into the group .
RONDA: Everybody hold hands , and close your eyes . Relax your muscles and take deep breaths .
JUSTIN: Now , try to feel what the other person is feeling , without speaking any words , send out
RONDA: Okay , open your eyes . What did everybody feel ?
GUY: I felt Mrs. Hunsaker 's strength .
OTHER GUY: I can feel that Ronda is one with the Earth , she 's so cosmically in tune .
RONDA: So right on , that 's exactly what I sent out , and I felt like , you were full of inner peace and harmony .
MR. BIXLER: Vada , what did you feel .
VADA: I felt Justin 's hangnail .

VADA: I do n't think I 'm allowed to .
JUSTIN: I tell you what , let 's try it again , hold hands .

RALPH: I 'm his brother .
HARRY: Oh then you 'll probably be visiting us here quite often .
RALPH: WHY ? ?
HARRY: Because if he ever tries to take Shelly 's camper again , I 'm gon na bury him in my front yard . Ralph looks rather disturbed by this
PHIL: Your father is a savage .
SHELLY: Bye Ralph .
HARRY: Is it really your camper ?
SHELLY: Can we see it from the back yard ?
HARRY: You can get the general idea They move off to the back yard

MARIAN: I wanted to ask you something . Those motorcycles across the street ?
PAULA: Uh-huh ?
MARIAN: What are they all doing there ?
PAULA: That 's the Satan 's Disciples ' New York headquarters .
MARIAN: The motorcycle gang ? Do n't they deal drugs and rape young girls ?
PAULA: I 've never had any problem with them . People say it 's the safest block in the East Village . I just hope their motorcycles do n't keep you up at night .
BIKER: Oh , Marian
PAULA: You did n't leave the house all day ? Marian shrugs .
MARIAN: Would you look at those strawberries . They made the best jam . Here are some more pictures of the farm . Crops were unbelievable this year . Paula continues to browse through the snaps .

PAULA: I was seeing Aaron and there were some complications .
MARIAN: He seemed quite taken with you .
PAULA: I do n't want to talk about it .
MARIAN: You know , you never tell me anything .
PAULA: That 's not true . Besides , I do n't want you dusting . I want you to see New York .

DISCIPLE PROSPECT: You 're just chilling , huh ? Not on this lock , do you understand ?
MARIAN: Oh , no .
DISCIPLE PROSPECT: What 's this , huh ?
KID: I ai n't got shit on me .
DISCIPLE PROSPECT: What is that ? You 're chilling , man ? Well , then maybe we need to warm things up for you , man . How many times do we got to tell you ? You do n't listen and you do n't learn and that 's the problem . That is the problem .
MARIAN: My daughter lives here and I 'm her mothe and I 've lost my keys . There 's no answer .
DISCIPLE: Roast him !
KID: All right all right all right .
MARIAN: Yes , is Paula there ? Could you leave her a message , please ? Tell her it 's urgent . Her mother has lost her keys and is stranded on the street with the Satan 's Disciples When she comes back , would you tell her to come home as quickly as she can ? Thank you .

So , then I followed him . Just like in the movies . And I found out that he has a wife and a little girl living in Brooklyn . We had been going together fo almost a year .
MARIAN: Men they 're all the same . Our pastor in Sioux Falls was caught with his wife 's sister .
MARIKA: Really ?
MARIAN: Oh , it was such a big scandal .
MARIKA: What happened ?
MARIAN: Poor man had to leave town . And I hear that other women came forward .

DISCIPLE PROSPECT: Who told you we deal drugs ?
MARIAN: I 'm just concerned about my daughter .
DISCIPLE PROSPECT: You do n't have to worry . She 's going to e fine . We 're law-abiding citizens just like you .
MARIAN: What about yesterday ? Kicking that poo oy ?
DISCIPLE PROSPECT: That poor boy 's a crack dealer from Alphabet City . We do not allow his kind on this block .

MARIAN: My daughter lives right across the street from the Satan 's Disciples ' clubhouse , and I was so worried about her so , I went over and introduced myself . And they were the nicest people .
MR. PALMER: Well , that 's a very unusual New York experience .
MARIAN: I had a wonderful time .
PAULA: Mom I mean , it 's amusing to imagine such a thing , but how many of those pills have you been taking ?
MARIAN: Oh , that has nothing to do with it .
PAULA: No , no , it 's my fault . I 've been pushing you too hard to do things on your own .
DISCIPLE PROSPECT: Yo , man ! The Disciple about to start his bike , turns .
PAULA: Mom , I need to talk to you .
MARIAN: If it 's about the bikers , dear , I do n't want to talk about it .

COMMENTATOR: `` Returning to England are Britain 's acting royalty Si Laurence Olivier and Lady Olivier , better known as stunning Gone With The Wind star Vivien Leigh . Sir Laurence has added a new string to his bow with the announcement that he is to direct and star in a screen version of Terence Rattigan 's stage play The Sleeping Prince with none othe than Hollywood siren Marilyn Monroe . When the world 's greatest actor romances the most famous woman alive , we can be sure that sparks will fly . Now , now Lady Olivier , do n't worry - any omance is strictly for the camera ! ''
KENNETH: and this is one of Carracci 's earlier works and one is able to see the emergence of his now famous Baroque style , which is clearly ooted in the tradition of high enaissance and antiquity
COLIN: I 'm leaving for London now , Pa .
KENNETH: Ah , yes . Well , bon chance , dea oy
JANE: Kenneth , you might have told Cook we were another two for dinner . What is everyone supposed to eat ? Cabbage soup ? Oh , Colin , darling , there you are
COLIN: I 'm off now , Mama .
JANE: Off ?
COLIN: My job interview , remember.. ?
JANE: Ca n't you stay for dinner ? There 's nothing to eat but I 'm sure the conversation will be charming .
COLIN: I do n't want to be late in the morning .
JANE: I 'm sure they wo n't mind . You 'll be a famous film director in no time . I know your father 's put in a word .
COLIN: I wish he had n't done that . I can manage on my own .
JANE: I have to watch Jenkins like a hawk . One more of his murderous prunings and we 'll lose the tea oses for ever .
VANESSA: You 're not in Mr. Perceval 's diary .
COLIN: Larry told me to come .
OFF: Yes ?
VANESSA: I have a Mr. Colin Clark here . He says Sir Laurence sent him .
OFF: Oh , God not another one of Vivien 's pretty boys .
PERCEVAL: Well , what do you want ?
COLIN: A job on your Marilyn Monroe film .
PERCEVAL: Oh really , what as ?
COLIN: I want to work on the production side .
PERCEVAL: There are no jobs yet . We do n't start shooting for eight weeks .
COLIN: May I wait ?
PERCEVAL: What ?
COLIN: Until there 's a job .
PERCEVAL: For eight weeks ?
COLIN: Something might come up .
PERCEVAL: Terry ? Larry wondered how the script was coming
COLIN: I 'll come back tomorrow morning . Just in case .
PERCEVAL: It 's a free country . He sounds as though he rather regrets it .
VANESSA: Are you going to sit there all day ?
COLIN: If I have to .
VANESSA: You 're very determined .
COLIN: I 'd do anything to be in the film usiness .
VANESSA: Anything ?
COLIN: Laurence Olivier Productions
ON PHONE: Is Sir Laurence there ?
COLIN: He 's at Notley until the end of the week . Can I take a message ?
ON PHONE: I 'll call back .
COLIN: Vanessa asked me to
PERCEVAL: Oh , did she ? Why did n't you put that call through ?
COLIN: There did n't seem any need to other you . But if you want me to transfer every single one PERCEVAL looks at him grudgingly .
PERCEVAL: Use your judgement . He hesitates and looks back .
ON PHONE: Hello , Mama .
JANE: Colin , darling ! How are you getting on ?
ON PHONE: This is urgent . I need Noel Coward 's London number . My life depends on it .
JANE: How exciting . Let me see it 's Sloane 2965 . Ask him if he 's coming to Saltwood for the bank holiday .
COLIN: I will . Mama , you 're an angel .
PERCEVAL: That was quick .
COLIN: I had a bit of luck . PERCEVAL looks at him shrewdly .
PERCEVAL: Am I supposed to be impressed ? Did Mummy and Daddy help ? Do n't think they can do the job for you . The only way you 'll get on in this usiness is through bloody hard work .
COLIN: Yes , sir . COLIN leaves .
OLIVIER: Do you know , Hughie , it is simply impossible to get Marilyn Monroe on the telephone ? The darling girl spends the entire day asleep . But great beauty has its way
VIVIEN: You remember Colin , darling . You met him at the Clarks ' party .
NO IDEA: Of course . What are you doing here ?
COLIN: You said there might be a job on your film .
OLIVIER: Have a cigarette . Keep the pack . He turns quickly to PERCEVAL .
PERCEVAL: The House Committee are threatening to withhold Miller 's passport . They say he 's a communist . No Arthur , no Marilyn .
OLIVIER: I 'll have a word with the American ambassador . I 'm taking him to see Vivien in South Sea Bubble on Thursday now , tell me , Hughie , are Terry 's rewrites in ?
VIVIEN: They named them after Larry . The first actor since Du Maurier to have his own brand and they pay him an absolute fortune . I 'm afraid they 're rathe ghastly .
VANESSA: I suppose he 's all right .
TO COLIN: Let 's elope together and have the most glorious affair . Oh , ut then , who 'd look after my poor Larry ?
OLIVIER: Let 's try to find him something to do , Hughie . COLIN grins in triumph . VIVIEN smiles at him .
VIVIEN: You will take care of my precious Larrykins , wo n't you ?
PERCEVAL: Arthur Jacobs , Miss Monroe 's publicist is flying in tomorrow . He wants to see the house she 'll e staying in . Find something suitable .
TO CARDIFF: Larry says he particularly likes this dress . She looks radiant .
CARDIFF: Exactly - we need to tone her down a bit .
PERCEVAL: How the hell do you tone down Marilyn Monroe ? !
COLIN: We 'd pay a hundred pounds pe week for 18 weeks .
NODS: She 's making a film with Si Laurence Olivier . The Sleeping Prince . From the play by Terence Rattigan .
COLIN: It 's Marilyn Monroe in the film . COTES-PREEDY smiles transparently .
JACOBS: Where 's the fucking car ?
COLIN: It 's very near Pinewood .
JACOBS: All right . We 'll take it . But ditch the wallpaper . It 's given me a migraine .
OLIVIER: News travels fast .
JACOBS: That house was perfect fo Marilyn .
PERCEVAL: We ca n't use it now .
COLIN: Yes we can . I knew Cotes-Preedy would n't be able to keep this quiet .
PERCEVAL: But now we have two expensive houses when we only wanted one .
COLIN: I thought someone else on the production might want it .
PERCEVAL: Oh , did you ?
JACOBS: I guess Milton could use it . It 's near the studio , near Marilyn .
OLIVIER: What are we paying you , boy ? He glances at COLIN with amusement .
COLIN: Nothing
LAUGHING: See to it , Hughie ! PERCEVAL sighs grimly .
COLIN: Colin Clark . Sir Laurence Olivie Productions .
PERCEVAL: The set decorators will have it all sorted out in no time .
JACOBS: Marilyn hates red . And blue . And green .
PERCEVAL: What about white ?
JACOBS: I 'd have to clear it with her . OLIVIER glances mischievously at Colin .
OLIVIER: Beige , then . Beige is rarely controversial .
JACOBS: I guess that 's okay . She 's neve said nothing about beige . Paula will need the room next door .
COLIN: Paula ?
JACOBS: Strasberg . Marilyn 's acting coach . OLIVIER looks at him darkly . JACOBS shrugs .
OLIVIER: Stanislavski and the Method are perfectly fine in the rehearsal oom but they do n't belong on a film set . Time is too tight . I 'm sure Marilyn understands .
JACOBS: Who the hell is this Commie Stan Slavski ?
ORTON: I do n't know why Hugh Perceval sent you here . There 's nothing I can do for you .
COLIN: Why not ?
ORTON: Are you in the union ?
COLIN: No
ORTON: Then you ca n't have a job on the film .
COLIN: How do I get in the union ?
ORTON: By getting a job on the film .
COLIN: But you just said I could n't have a job on the film unless I was in the union .
ORTON: Exactly . It 's called a closed shop .
COLIN: A third ?
ORTON: Third Assistant Director . You do know what the job is ?
COLIN: Assisting the director ?
ORTON: Christ , no ! That 's the last thing you do . Lesson One . The third 's job is to do whatever the fuck I tell him . ORTON walks to the door , then looks back .
SHOUTS: What are you waiting for ? COLIN scrambles to follow him out .
ORTON: Colin ! COLIN jumps as ORTON glowers at him .
COLIN: Got it . But he sneaks a look back at LUCY as he goes .
ORTON: Where are you staying ?
COLIN: My father 's place in the Albany .
ORTON: You can forget that . Lesson Three . The Third always stays nearby , not in some bloody palace in London . Book a room at the Dog And Duck down the road . It 's a bit ough but you 'll get used to it . He grins , enjoying himself .
PERCEVAL: I 'm sure you understand the sensitive nature of the job , Superintendant ?
ROGER: No need for the title . I 'm etired from the force . Something about looking after a cinema actress ?
PERCEVAL: Not just any actress . Marilyn Monroe .
ROGER: I 've never had much time for the pictures .
PERCEVAL: Excellent . For the next four months you never leave he side , day or night . There will be crowds .
ROGER: That does n't bother me . PERCEVAL pauses awkwardly .
PERCEVAL: Her behaviour is reputedly a little erratic .
ROGER: She drinks ?
PERCEVAL: Amongst other things .
ROGER: Pills ? PERCEVAL leaves a tactful pause .
PERCEVAL: It would be useful if you could keep us informed of her domestic situation .
ROGER: You want me to spy on her ?
PERCEVAL: Just the odd early warning if you know she 's going to be late on set . That kind of thing .
JACOBS: You need to speak to the Coca-Cola people , Larry . They 're crazy to be involved with Marilyn .
PERCEVAL: Good news . The House Committee have decided Miller is n't a communist after all .
JACOBS: Of course he is . All those pain in the ass New York intellectuals are reds .
PERCEVAL: It means Marilyn will be flying in next week on schedule .
JACOBS: She 'll have to be met .
OLIVIER: Naturally , Vivien and I will be there to greet her . But let 's keep it low key , shall we ?
JACOBS: Do n't worry . I 've got it all unde control .
OLIVIER: It is a deep happiness to me to e translating Terence Rattigan 's magnificent play to the screen
REPORTER: The plane 's landed !
VIVIEN: It seems we 're not top of the ill anymore , darling .
REPORTER: There she is ! Marilyn !
REPORTER 2: Marilyn , this way.. !
JACOBS: Beautiful . You 're looking at tomorrow 's front page , boys . ROGER looks at COLIN .
ROGER: We have to get them to the hall .
OLIVIER: It 's my genuine pleasure to introduce a woman who needs no introduction .
REPORTER: How do you like being married , Marilyn ?
MARILYN: I like it a lot .
REPORTER: Is this third time lucky ?
MARILYN: You bet it is . Arthur 's the greatest man I ever met .
REPORTER: Marilyn , are you planning to see the sights ?
MARILYN: I 'd love to see the little fellow with the bow and arrow in Piccadilly Circus .
REPORTER 2: Is it true you want to be a classical actor now ?
MARILYN: I want to be the best actress I can be .
REPORTER 2: There 's a rumour you 're going to e in The Brothers Karamazov on Broadway .

SHOUTS: Which of them will you be playing ?
MARILYN: I 'll be playing Grushenka .
REPORTER 3: Can you spell that ?
MARILYN: Sure . Can you ? There is laughter at the reporter 's expense .
REPORTER: So would you say you 're an intellectual now ?
MARILYN: My husband is .
REPORTER 2: What 's your definition of an intellectual , Marilyn ?
MARILYN: I guess you could look it up in a dictionary .
REPORTER: Vivien , you created the part of Elsie Marina on stage . Do you have any advice for Marilyn ?
VIVIEN: I am sure if Miss Monroe needs any advice she 'll get it from he director . I hear he 's terribly good .
OLIVIER: In The Sleeping Prince we have discovered the perfect vehicle for Miss Monroe 's luminous and justly celebrated talent He stops as a REPORTER shouts over him .
JACOBS: Marilyn , is it true you wea nothing in bed except Chanel No
MARILYN: As I 'm in England let 's say I sleep in nothing but Yardley 's Lavender .
VIVIEN: Are all your press conferences like that , darling ?
MARILYN: Well , that was quieter than some .
JACOBS: Okay , let 's get a snap of the newlyweds . Smile , Arthur . It 's not a firing squad .
MILTON: This is some place you found .
OLIVIER: You have my new assistant Colin to thank for that . This is Milton Greene . You must be very nice to him . He owns half of Marilyn Monroe Productions .
MILTON: Forty nine per cent , Larry . GREENE offers them a tired smile .
OLIVIER: Have a cigarette .
MILTON: I do n't smoke .
OLIVIER: Milton - Marilyn and rehearsals . Let 's talk .
MILTON: Sure . And the studio wants a new title . OLIVIER escorts Milton away .
JACOBS: The boys at the gate are getting estless .
MILLER: Let 's give them two minutes and then we 're done .
VIVIEN: Marvellous , is n't she ? I suppose you 're quite smitten .
COLIN: She 's all right . A bit common .
LAUGHS: Larry fell desperately in love with her in New York . He 's determined to seduce her .
COLIN: But she 's only been married three weeks .
VIVIEN: Oh , Colin , I thought you were a man of the world .
COLIN: I 'm sure he loves you very much .
VIVIEN: Oh , do n't be such a boy !
COLIN: Of course . Everyone does .
VIVIEN: I 'm 43 , darling . No one will love me for much longer . Not even you .
COLIN: Colin Clark . I booked a room .
BARRY: What brings you up this way ?
COLIN: I 'm here working on a film .
BARRY: What film 's that ?
COLIN: It 's called ` The Sleeping Prince ' .
ANDY: Sounds lousy .
BARRY: Ignore , Andy - not a film fan - are you , Andy ? ANDY does n't look away from his game .
ANDY: Ca n't be bothered . COLIN tries to impress .
COLIN: Marilyn Monroe 's in it . I 'll be working with her .
BARRY: Oh , will you now ?
ANDY: The Queen and Prince Philip popped in for a pint earlier . Pity , you just missed them .
BARRY: The room 's three quid a week , first week in advance . You 're in numbe two .
WATTIS: What a wonderful adventure , Dame Sybil .
SYBIL THORNDIKE: Such a lark ! I long to see her .
COLIN: Miss Monroe ?
PAULA: But Marilyn is not ready . She 's preparing .
MARILYN: Excuse the horrible face .
OLIVIER: Marilyn , here you are , everyone is so excited to meet you He gestures to the company .
SYBIL THORNDIKE: How lovely you are . Here , I kept a place for you .
PAULA: I have to be next to Marilyn !
TO MARILYN: Do n't worry , dear , we wo n't bite . PAULA looks at her in truculent apology .
PAULA: She likes me by her side .
SYBIL THORNDIKE: What a good idea ! I wish we could all bring a friend . One does get so terribly nervous . It 's just like the first day at school , is n't it ?
OLIVIER: Welcome dear Marilyn , to ou little fraternity . We may seem a little strange and quaint to you at first , but I hope that in time you may come to find your method in our madness .
MARILYN: Gee , Mister Sir , I could listen to your accent all day .
OLIVIER: You are amongst friends , my darling angel . Just plain Larry will suffice . When you 're eady.. ? Flustered , MARILYN looks at her script .
PAULA: Remember why you 're in the embassy , Marilyn . What does the Grand Duke want from Elsie ? She thought there were going to be a lot of people here and it 's just her . OLIVIER waits patiently .
OLIVIER: It 's your line , Marilyn .
MARILYN: Oh , let 's see `` Oh , and am I what you 'd call new hat ? ''
PAULA: Locate the experience , Marilyn . Look for the memory that helps you . Remember when you went to that party at Chaplin 's house and you were the only guest ? How did that make you feel ? This time OLIVIER stares at PAULA .
OLIVIER: It is only a readthrough , Paula .
PAULA: Marilyn has to begin finding the character .
OLIVIER: The character is on the page .
PAULA: The words , maybe . Not the character . RICHARD WATTIS whispers to PAUL HARDWICK .
WATTIS: She 's half cut !
SYBIL THORNDIKE: Are n't we going to have fun ?
OLIVIER: We ca n't have two fucking directors !
MILTON: Marilyn wants Paula .
OLIVIER: Why ? She 's got me !
MILTON: Paula is costing us two and half thousand bucks a week . We might as well use her . Listen Larry , accept Marilyn on her own terms and you 'll be okay .
OLIVIER: Dear Christ , what have I got myself into ?
COLIN: Come out with me tonight .
LUCY: I 'm working .
COLIN: Tomorrow night , then .
LUCY: I 'm washing my hair .
COLIN: Your hair 's lovely .
LUCY: Look , I have two rules . One , never touch the talent
COLIN: Everyone has a lot of rules around here .
LUCY: and two , never go out with thirds .
COLIN: Why not ?
LUCY: Because they 're all randy little uggers who just want some fun during shooting .
COLIN: I 'm not like that . She looks at him sceptically .
SIGHS: I 'm free on Saturday .
OFF: Colin !
SYBIL THORNDIKE: How kind of you to meet us . Dea me , you do look cold .
COLIN: They 're ready for you in make-up Dame Sybil .
SYBIL THORNDIKE: How exciting ! Do n't you love the first day of a new production ?
COLIN: I do n't know , Dame Sybil . I 've never had one before . DAME SYBIL gazes at him with wistful sadness .
SYBIL THORNDIKE: Oh , to be young again !
OLIVIER: Marilyn here yet ?
COLIN: Not yet .
ORTON: What the fuck 's going on ? I thought you had a contact in he house .
COLIN: I do
ORTON: Well bloody use him , then .
ROGER: She has n't come down yet . Neithe has Miller . They 're playing trains . COLIN stares at him blankly .
ON PHONE: Well ? What 's happening ?
COLIN: She 's getting into character .
OLIVIER: She 's kept Dame Sybil Thorndike waiting in full costume for two hours . It 's simply not fair .
PAULA: She was n't happy with her make- up .
OLIVIER: Right , Mr. Orton you wanted me to check the back projection . Please join us , Mr. Cardiff .
SYBIL THORNDIKE: Is n't she pretty though ?
COLIN: Would you like to sit down , Dame Sybil ?
SYBIL THORNDIKE: How kind of you , Colin . Yes , why do n't we all sit down ?
TREVOR: Are you a member of NATTKE ?
COLIN: What ?
TREVOR: That chair is a prop . Props are NATTKE . If ACT members are going to do NATTKE jobs , I 'm calling my men out .
SYBIL THORNDIKE: I 'm sure we 're all good union members here . There 's no need to fall out over something so trivial .
TREVOR: It might be trivial to you , Dame Sybil , but it 's my livelihood . He 's not in the union . Put the chair down . COLIN stares at him , frozen .
SYBIL THORNDIKE: I rather think you 've made you point . Solidarity is the important thing here . When unions fall out , it 's only management that benefits .
TO COLIN: If I see you doing a NATTKE jo again I 'll close this set down quicker than you can blink . He turns to one of his men .
SYBIL THORNDIKE: I was on the picket lines in 1926 , you know .
ORTON: Did n't they teach you anything at Eton ? Now fuck off and see if you can get me a bacon sandwich without starting World War III .
DENYS: Camera running .
ORTON: Very quiet , everyone
DENYS: Speed . The CLAPPER LOADER clicks the clapperboard .
CLAPPERBOY: Twenty two , take one .
ORTON: Action !
CONT'D: He is now called the Duke of Strelitz , he can not of course go to the Abbey tomorrow , but he is most anxious you should invite him to the room you have taken in the Ritz for Nicky . Maud ?
MARILYN: Gee . I forgot my line . I 'm sorry .
OLIVIER: Cut . SYBIL THORNDIKE smiles cheerfully .
SYBIL THORNDIKE: It 's so easily done , is n't it ? I 'm sure I went wrong somewhere there too . Shall we have anothe go , Larry ?
HALTING: `` Oh , I 'm quite sure you do n't , your royal , oh , I mean , your , uh , Imperial your uh serene majesty . ''
SYBIL THORNDIKE: Did n't I have a line somewhere there , dear ?
OLIVIER: Cut .
ORTON: Action !
TO OLIVIER: `` Dear ? ''
ORTON: Check the gate .
FOCUS PULLER: Gate 's good .
OLIVIER: Print .
SYBIL THORNDIKE: That was perfect , Marilyn . You 're Elsie to the life !
MARILYN: Can I ?
OLIVIER: She 's impossible . I should have cast Vivien .
COLIN: If anyone can make her great , it 's you . You 're a genius .
OLIVIER: Oh , yes . The world 's greatest living actor , so they say .
MARILYN: I just ca n't figure this movie out .
PAULA: You were wonderful . You are the most gifted actress I have eve known . You were superb , Marilyn . You were divine .
MARILYN: He was angry with me , I could tell .
PAULA: You were great . You are a great , great actress . All my life I have prayed for a great actress I could help and guide .
MARILYN: Come on , Paula , get up .
PAULA: Not until you admit you were great . MARILYN smiles , her mood slowly lightening .
MARILYN: Oh , okay . I guess I was .
COLIN: You really were very good , Miss Monroe .
LUCY: Are you sure you can afford all this ?
COLIN: Oh , it 's all right .
LUCY: It must be costing a week 's wages .
COLIN: It 's worth it . LUCY ca n't help being charmed .
LUCY: You 're not the average third , are you ? Most of them would be happy with a swift half and a grope in the pub car park .
COLIN: I 'm not living off my parents , if that 's what you mean . I want to make my own way , no matter what .
LUCY: By making eyes at Vivien Leigh ?
COLIN: Who told you that ?
LUCY: Word gets around .
COLIN: Vivien 's a friend of my father 's .
LUCY: So there 's nothing in it ? You and Vivien ?
WAITER: You 'll be signing on your father 's account , sir ? COLIN blushes violently .
COLIN: Certainly not . I settle my own ills .
LUCY: Of course you were .
COLIN: Not compared to you . LUCY laughs , COLIN looks hurt .
LUCY: You do n't have to try so hard to be charming . You 're nice enough as it is . Well , you could be .
COLIN: So they say .
LUCY: She married Miller on the ebound . The papers are calling them `` The Hourglass and the Egghead '' .
COLIN: Which one is which ?
LUCY: Wait a while , crocodile .
COLIN: I really do like you , Lucy . She looks at him shrewdly .
LUCY: Maybe .
MR. ARMSTRONG: Time to be thinking about bed , darling . Early start tomorrow .
LUCY: Sorry , Daddy . We were just going over tomorrow 's schedule .
COLIN: Yes , I should be off . Colin Clark . Pleased to meet you , Mr. Armstrong .
MR. ARMSTRONG: Do you know this part of the world ?
THROWN: Umm not really . My family are more country people .
SYBIL THORNDIKE: Colin , dear , I thought you looked cold so I bought you this .
COLIN: Thank you , Dame Sybil .
SYBIL THORNDIKE: Film sets and rehearsal rooms are the coldest places on earth .
OLIVIER: She should be on time , like everyone else .
MILTON: She is a star .
OLIVIER: I 'm a fucking star ! He looks around in frustration .
MILTON: This is Marilyn you 're talking about .
OLIVIER: Marilyn , darling you are an angel , and I kiss the hem of you garment , but why ca n't you get here on time for the love of fuck ?
MARILYN: Oh you have that word in England too ?
PAULA: Marilyn has to prepare properly . She has to find in herself all that lies under the surface . Acting is n't just a case of putting on a costume or some ludicrous false nose .
OLIVIER: You must apologise to Dame Sybil .
MARILYN: I 'm sorry
SYBIL THORNDIKE: My dear , you must n't concern yourself . A great actress like you has many other things on he mind .
MARILYN: You think I 'm a great actress ?
SYBIL THORNDIKE: None of the rest of us truly know how to act for the camera . But you do . It is a rare gift . She looks sharply at OLIVIER . SYBIL THORNDIKE This poor girl has n't had you years of experience . She is in a strange country , acting a strange part . Now , are you helping o ullying ?
MILLER: That one 's pretty damn good . You knocked it out of the park . MARILYN glows at his praise .
MILTON: When Marilyn gets it right you just do n't want to look at anyone else .
OLIVIER: We 've only been shooting for fou days and we 're already two weeks ehind . COLIN ca n't resist blurting out a comment .
COLIN: Why not only show her the good takes ? Then she might feel bette about herself .
MILTON: The kid 's right . She could use the confidence .
OLIVIER: I believe it 's traditional fo the producer of the film to watch ushes . Besides , she 's an experienced actress . She should learn from her mistakes .
COLIN: They just upset her .
OLIVIER: Not half as much as they upset me .
ORTON: I 'll do that . You go and find Marilyn 's script . She thinks she left it in her dressing room .
COLIN: Your script
MARILYN: I found it .
COLIN: David wants to know if you 're eady for the extras in the allroom scene .
LUCY: Tell him he can start sending them up . Women first . They kiss again . He pulls away .
AWKWARD: I forgot . I ca n't do Saturday . Marilyn wants to go shopping .
LUCY: Since when do you work for her ?
COLIN: Larry asked me to help out .
LUCY: Well , of course you must do what Larry says .
COLIN: Next Friday instead ? She shrugs in agreement .
MARILYN: Gee , it 's quiet .
COLIN: It 's Saturday . Early closing . But they 're expecting us .
MILTON: No one 's recognised her .
COLIN: At least she can shop in peace .
MILTON: Marilyn 's a star . Stars do n't even pee alone .
ROGER: My God , she 'll be torn apart
MILLER: Get her out of here .
MILTON: Jeez , Marilyn , they really fucking love you .
MILLER: Madness . Someone 's going to get hurt .
OLIVIER: Cut . The line is `` Gee , this is all right too , is n't it '' . It 's a tiny word , my darling , but it matters . Let 's go straight away .
DENYS: Camera running .
SOUNDMAN: Speed .
DENYS: Mark it .
OLIVIER: Cut . Nearly there , but Terry did work so very hard on this and we must try to get it right for him . Straight away , please . Take three .
MARILYN: Ca n't we just drop it ?
OLIVIER: The point is that you have already admired the downstairs hall in an earlier scene . Now you are admiring this room as well .
MARILYN: Oh , sure . Paula !
TO OLIVIER: The reason Marilyn ca n't remembe the line is because she does n't elieve the situation her characte is in .
OLIVIER: Then she should pretend to elieve it .
PAULA: Pretend ? We 're talking about the difference between the truth and artificial crap .
OLIVIER: We 're in absolute agreement , Paula . Acting is all about sincerity . And if you can fake that , you 're off to the races .
MILTON: Maybe we should try for anothe take .
PAULA: Marilyn needs time to give a great performance . You should give her as long as it takes . Chaplin took eight months to make a movie .
OLIVIER: Eight months of this ? I 'd rathe kill myself .
MARILYN: I ca n't do this . I ca n't . PAULA looks at her adamantly .
PAULA: You can do it . You ca n't fail . You will have more pain , you will suffer more but you will create . All you need is time .
OLIVIER: ( Under his breath to
COLIN: God knows , but I 'm a weeping fucking willow .
TO MARILYN: Think about the things you like , instead of him . Frank Sinatra . Coca Cola . Be specific . The character comes alive if you know what you 're doing .
OLIVIER: Cut .
MARILYN: I do n't know who Elsie is . I ca n't act her if I do n't know who she is !
OLIVIER: Elsie is all in the script
MARILYN: I ca n't find her . She 's not there .
OLIVIER: But you have her precisely , you know her inside out . I 'm in awe of your gift . We all are .
MARILYN: She 's not real .
OLIVIER: Why not simply rely on your natural talents ?
MARILYN: Are you saying I do n't need to act ?
OLIVIER: Marilyn , you are the most attractive woman in the world . I 'm simply suggesting you be yourself .
SHOUTS: I do n't want to be myself ! I want to be an actress playing a character .
OLIVIER: All you have to do , dear Marilyn , is be sexy . Is n't that what you do ?
MARILYN: I want Lee .
OLIVIER: You 've already got Paula , fo heaven 's sake . I 'm the director . Speak to me .
PAULA: I am only Lee 's representative .
OLIVIER: It 's five in the morning in New York .
OLIVIER: `` O , now , for ever Farewell the tranquil mind/Farewell content Farewell the plumed troop and the ig wars/That make ambition virtue O , farewell/Farewell '' Paula 's not an actress . She not a director , not a teacher . Her only talent is uttering up Marilyn .
MILTON: It would be worse if she was n't around .
OLIVIER: You know what would make Marilyn Monroe a real actor ? A season in ep . They would n't stand for this kind of nonsense at the Hippodrome in Eastbourne .
MILTON: You have to be patient with her .
OLIVIER: Trying to teach Marilyn how to act is like teaching Urdu to a adger .
MILTON: I better go see her . She 'll need something to help her calm down . COLIN holds the door for him as he goes out .
OLIVIER: Pills to sleep , pills to wake up . Pills to calm her down , pills to give her energy . No wonder she 's permanently ten feet underwater .
COLIN: Maybe she 's scared .
OLIVIER: We 're all scared . It 's part of eing an actor .
COLIN: But you have the training to deal with it . OLIVIER turns from the mirror to survey him .
OLIVIER: I would n't buy the little girl lost act if I were you . Though heaven knows it 's tempting . He sighs wistfully .
COLIN: Are you sure they wo n't mind ?
ROGER: Help yourself . They can spare it . Marilyn 's okay . She 's taken some pills and gone to bed . He frowns darkly .
COLIN: You mean Miller ?
ROGER: The others . They 're terrified their cash cow will slip away . He smiles grimly and raises his beer bottle .
OFF: Marilyn . Come back to bed . It 's not what you think .
COLIN: Good morning , Miss Monroe .
OLIVIER: It 's nearly lunch time .
MILTON: She is n't feeling the part .
OLIVIER: It 's a light comedy . How much feeling can it possibly require ?
MILTON: Give her a few minutes
OLIVIER: She ca n't hide in her bloody dressing room all day .
MILTON: Oh , yes she can .
TO COLIN: Go and find out what the hell 's going on .
PAULA: It 's Colin .
MARILYN: How old are you ?
COLIN: 24 . Nearly
MARILYN: You remind us of the young king in the movie . Kind of honest and innocent .
WOUNDED: I 'm not innocent .
MARILYN: What 's your job on this picture ?
COLIN: I 'm the third assistant director . Just a gopher really . Go fo this , go for that
MARILYN: You 're Larry 's assistant too . He shrugs awkwardly .
COLIN: He was worried about you .
MARILYN: Are you spying on me ?
COLIN: No ! Of course not . Why would anyone spy on you ? She sighs , and looks away .
MARILYN: Colin ? Whose side are you on ?
COLIN: Yours , Miss Monroe .
MARILYN: Call me Marilyn .
WATTIS: Marilyn 's got a new boyfriend . Larry will get jealous .
HARDWICK: You can say that again .
COLIN: Nothing happened .
WATTIS: You were in there for ten minutes at least . Plenty of time for a kiss and a cuddle .
COLIN: Paula was with us the whole time .
WATTIS: The mind boggles , dear .
MILLER: I dreamed last night I could hea singing . And then I realised it was n't a dream . There was a male voice choir serenading Marilyn under our window . At two in the morning . It 's a circus . A freak show . OLIVIER smiles but MILLER looks dazed .
OLIVIER: That wo n't help Marilyn .
MILLER: I ca n't help her . You know what she loves to do most ? Sleep . It 's what she lives for . Sleep is her demon . He pauses for a second .
OLIVIER: About her ? He looks up and nods slowly .
MILLER: She took them the wrong way . He leaves a long , uneasy pause .
OLIVIER: But you do love her ? Your new ide and all that ? MILLER plays with his whisky .
MILLER: I ca n't work . I ca n't think . She 's devouring me .
VIVIEN: Hello , Colin darling . You look like Horatio defending the idge . Are you going to let me in ?
ORTON: Just doing my job .
VIVIEN: I 'm getting old , Jack . I need you to work your miracles on me .
CARDIFF: You 're more beautiful every year , Vivien .
VIVIEN: Now , you are looking after Larry like I told you ?
COLIN: I 'm doing my best
VIVIEN: Darling Marilyn !
MARILYN: Oh , but everyone says you were a wonderful Elsie on stage .
VIVIEN: But I 'm too old to play her in the film . Larry was quite brutal about that . You see , the truth is all that matters to him . That 's why we all admire him so very much .
OLIVIER: You should n't upset yourself . You are ten times the actress she will ever be .
VIVIEN: If you could see yourself . The way you watch her
OLIVIER: There 's never been anything etween Marilyn and me . She laughs hysterically .
VIVIEN: Only because she did n't want you .
OLIVIER: You 're imagining things .
VIVIEN: Do you think I 'm a fool ? You did n't think the little tart could resist the great Laurence Olivier .
OLIVIER: Vivien.. !
MILTON: Marilyn wo n't shoot today . She 's gone back to Parkside . She 's upset about Arthur leaving England .
OLIVIER: He 's only going to visit his children .
MILTON: You do n't leave Marilyn alone . She ca n't handle it . She thinks everyone 's going to abandon her .
OLIVIER: Perhaps she 's come back . Yes ?
OFF: Sir Laurence ? It 's Roger .
OLIVIER: Oh , Roger . What 's up ?
OFF: Is Colin there , Sir ? He frowns and looks at COLIN in bewilderment .
OLIVIER: Yes , he 's here . It 's fo you .
COLIN: Roger ?
ON PHONE: Colin , why do n't you drop by here on your way home ?
MILTON: What the heck ?
OLIVIER: Why is Marilyn on the phone to my third fucking assistant ? COLIN looks around helplessly .
COLIN: Yes , I 'm sure I can do that . CUT TO PARKSIDE . MARILYN smiles .
ON PHONE: Good . Do n't tell anyone though . She hangs up .
OLIVIER: Well ? What did she want ?
COLIN: She wants to see me .
MILTON: He should n't be talking to her . He 's just a kid . Supposing he says something ? Why the hell did n't she call me ?
OLIVIER: I 'm sure Colin knows what he 's doing . Do n't you , Colin ?
ROGER: Miss Monroe said for you to wait . She wo n't be long .
OFF: Help yourself to a drink .
COLIN: I was just checking you 've got everything you need .
MARILYN: Here , let me .
COLIN: No .
MARILYN: Good . Because I like you .
COLIN: I 'm only the third . Just a messenger , really .
MARILYN: But you know what 's going on . You can see both sides of the situation . He shrugs in helpless agreement .
COLIN: There 's no Mrs. Colin .
MARILYN: So we can talk as long as we like ? He nods uncertainly . She frowns .
COLIN: I 'll tell you what 's wrong . It 's agony for him because he 's a great actor who wants to be a film star , and agony for you ecause you 're a film star who wants to be a great actress . And this film wo n't help either of you .
MARILYN: Are you sure you can handle that ? You do n't look old enough to drink .
COLIN: I 'm 23 , Miss Monroe .
MARILYN: It 's Marilyn . I 'm 30 . I guess that makes me an old lady to you .
COLIN: Seven years is nothing . She smiles then sits opposite him .
MARILYN: Do you know I 've been married three times already ? How did that happen ?
COLIN: You were just looking for the ight man .
MARILYN: They always look right at the start .
COLIN: Hello ?
MILTON: Colin ? Is everything okay ? What did she want ?
COLIN: Everything 's fine . Miss Monroe just had some large packages she needed handling
MILTON: Let me speak to her , Colin .
COLIN: She 's tied up right now .
MILTON: What 's going on ? Colin ! Let me talk to her , damn it !
COLIN: I 'm sorry , Milton . I have to go .
MARILYN: Let 's walk in the garden . See if we can find any more reporters in the bushes .
COLIN: You should get out more . See the sights .
MARILYN: I am the sights . She giggles again , her mood lighter .
COLIN: I do n't think he 'd mind .
MARILYN: I wanted to be an artist . To grow as an actor . I was so proud to be working with the great Olivier . Now he thinks I 'm the enemy . She looks at him innocently . COLIN hesitates .
COLIN: He does n't understand your kind of actor . He 's hated the method ever since Vivien worked with Elia Kazan . It 's all too new and strange . You 're the future , and it frightens him .
MARILYN: Every time I walk into the studio I feel this sense of doom come over me . He looks at me like he 's smelling a pile of rotten fish . And the crew hate me . Paula is the only person I can trust . Except for you now , maybe .
ROGER: Phone call for you , Miss Monroe . It 's Mr. Miller .
MARILYN: Goodbye , Colin . Thanks fo telling me the truth .
ROGER: You 'll be leaving now , I expect .
OLIVIER: I do n't care if he fucks he sideways . Perhaps it 'll calm he down . Oh , hello , boy . He smiles cheerfully .
COLIN: I did n't spend the night with her . We just had a chat .
MILTON: I heard them chuckling .
OLIVIER: Perhaps if Colin is very diplomatic Marilyn is more likely to behave herself .
COLIN: She just wants a chum , that 's all .
MILTON: A chum ? Jesus Christ , what is this , Goodbye Mr. Chips ? Grow up , kid .
OLIVIER: I thought working with Marilyn would make me feel young again . But I look dead in the rushes . Dead behind the eyes . He gazes at himself thoughtfully .
SOUNDMAN: What was Marilyn like then , Col ?
HARDWICK: Going over her lines with her , were you ?
SOUNDMAN: Will she be in today or is she too tired ?
COLIN: She was just being friendly .
WATTIS: I 'll bet .
COLIN: Oh , fuck off , Dickie . You 've never slept with a woman in you life .
WATTIS: I know a Femme Fatale when I see one , love .
ORTON: Three minutes , ladies and gents . Three minutes .
MILTON: Arthur Miller called me . He 's not happy with you .
COLIN: He does n't even know who I am .
MILTON: Marilyn must have said something .
COLIN: Maybe she was trying to make him jealous
MILTON: Listen , kid , I 've known Marilyn for seven years . I fell in love with her , just like you 've done .
COLIN: I do n't need your advice . And I 'm not in love with her .
MILTON: Okay , have it your way . You do n't see Marilyn again , you do n't even talk to her . She is completely off-limits to you . Got it ?
LUCY: I waited for you on Friday .
COLIN: Oh , God I 'm sorry I forgot I 've just been so busy .
SHARP: So I hear .
SHRUGS: You know how crews gossip . There 's nothing in it .
LUCY: Of course there is n't . Marilyn Monroe fancying you ? Come on .
MARILYN: Hi , Colin .
COLIN: Of course not . You know how crews like to gossip .
MARILYN: Too bad . You look cute together .
LUCY: I thought you were different .
COLIN: Lucy , I really like you . We 've had such fun
LUCY: And now it 's time to set you sights a little higher . I get it . Who do you think you are , Cary Grant ?
ROGER: Get in .
MILTON: Any problem , Roger ?
ROGER: Just dropped by to take Colin out to lunch .
MILTON: You 're not taking him to Marilyn ? That would drop us all in a whole ocean of shit .
ROGER: Oh , no , sir . MILTON sees a bulky blanket on the back seat .
MILTON: What do you have in there ?
ROGER: Just a picnic . We 've been looking forward to it , have n't we , Colin ?
MILTON: Okay , well , have a nice time boys . Inside the car COLIN looks at ROGER .
COLIN: Is she okay ?
COLIN: Oh , Jesus - She laughs , looking wonderfully naughty .
MARILYN: Roger and I decided to take you out for an adventure . Did n't we Roger ?
PAINED: Indeed we did .
COLIN: Oh , God . If Milton sees me with you I 'll be sacked
MARILYN: No one can sack you , Colin . Except me , of course . She pats the seat next to her .
MILTON: What the hell ?
SHOUTS: Colin ! Get back here , you little astard ! You 're fired ! Do you hea me ? Fired !
MARILYN: Do you think he saw me ?
LAUGHS: Just kidding .
COLIN: We have today , anyway . One day to do whatever we like . We can go ack to real life tomorrow .
MARILYN: Only one day ?
COLIN: Well , maybe the weekend .
MARILYN: Or a week ?
COLIN: We could go to Windsor Castle , if you like .
ROGER: Detective Chief Superintendant Smith . I 'm escorting this lady and gentleman for the day . They 'd like to look around the castle .
POLICEMAN: Christ , is that.. ? He stares in disbelief . ROGER smiles .
ROGER: Well , it 's not Diana bloody Dors , is it ?
POLICEMAN: Does she know anyone here , sir ? We need to write down a contact name in the book .
ROGER: You do n't know Her Majesty , by any chance ?
MARILYN: We met at a movie premiere . She said my dress was pretty .
POLICEMAN: I 'm not sure that quite
POLICEMAN: Name ?
COLIN: Clark . Colin Clark .
POLICEMAN: He says to go straight up the hill , sir . You 'll be met at the door .
MORSHEAD: Colin , my boy ! Come in , come in . Forgive the dust .
MARILYN: Gee , I 'd love to read all these ooks some time .
MORSHEAD: Luckily one does n't really have to . A lot of them just have pictures in .
MARILYN: She 's beautiful .
MORSHEAD: She was the daughter of one of the King 's courtiers , nearly 400 years ago .
MARILYN: I hope I look that good when I 'm
MORSHEAD: And these are all by Leonardo Da Vinci .
MARILYN: I 've heard of him ! Did n't he paint that lady with the funny smile ?
MORSHEAD: The Mona Lisa .
MARILYN: Do you have that one here too ?
MORSHEAD: Alas , that one got away .
MARILYN: Really ?
MORSHEAD: Oh , yes . Why , she was only saying to me the other day , `` what must it be like to be the most famous woman on earth '' ?
MARILYN: Look , Colin . COLIN kneels at her side .
MORSHEAD: You must n't let me keep you . I 'm sure you 're longing to be on you way .
MARILYN: Shall I be `` her '' ?
SPECTATOR: Are you somebody , mate ?
SMILES: I 'm no one .
MARILYN: This is n't a school , it 's a palace ! COLIN smiles .
COLIN: Eton is 500 years old . It was founded by King Henry VI .
MARILYN: It 's like walking through history .
COLIN: Take that room up there . They stop as COLIN points up at a window .
MARILYN: Whipped ?
COLIN: Beaten . She looks appalled .
MARILYN: I 'd never send my kids away . How long were you here ?
COLIN: Five years . But I was sent to oarding school when I was eight .
MARILYN: Why ?
COLIN: That 's what we do in my family . She smiles at this , looking at him shrewdly .
MARILYN: It seems to me that you 've had most things pretty easy .
COLIN: In one way , yes . But when you 're ought up in a house of over- achievers , it 's hard to make you own mark .
MARILYN: So how are you going to do it ?
COLIN: Maybe it will be in films , but if not , there are so many possibilities out there .
MARILYN: Sounds pretty good to me .
SCHOOLBOY: Marilyn ! It 's Marilyn Monroe !
MARILYN: Work hard , boys ! I do n't want anyone whipping you !
BOY: You can whip me anytime , Marilyn !
MARILYN: Hurry up , slow poke .
COLIN: But we have n't got any
MARILYN: Oh my gosh ! It 's freezing !
COLIN: What if a boat goes past ? We could be arrested .
MARILYN: Do n't worry . Roger will fix it . Oh , darn it
COLIN: What 's wrong ?
MARILYN: I have something in my eye .
COLIN: I ca n't see anything .
MARILYN: Get closer .
COLIN: Let me warm you up .
MARILYN: Do n't spoil it .
ROGER: Time to go home , I think , Miss Monroe .
MARILYN: Hi Milton . She smiles sweetly .
TO ROGER: Take him home .
OLIVIER: You spent the day with her . What frame of mind was she in ?
COLIN: She was fine .
COLIN: Do n't start , Dicky .
WATTIS: You wo n't get any sympathy from me , dear . Frankly I would n't care if Marilyn dropped dead tomorrow .
COLIN: She 's trying her best .
WATTIS: She 's Marilyn Monroe . This is he life . Pills , booze , sex , more pills . God , it must be wonderful !
MILTON: Marilyn 's not well .
COLIN: But she was wonderful yesterday .
MILTON: I do n't know what you did to her , kid , but she got nervous . I had to give her some pills to calm her down .
COLIN: She does n't need pills ! She just needs someone to care for her .
MILTON: Someone like you ?
COLIN: I told you , I 'm not in love with her !
MILTON: You kissed her .
COLIN: She said that ?
MILTON: Spare me the bullshit . I know everything .
OFF: Colin ! Colin !
COLIN: Roger ? What 's the matter ?
OFF: It 's Marilyn .
COLIN: Is she dead ?
ROGER: She 's asking for you . She 's sick . I think she might be in a coma .
COLIN: How can she be asking for me if she 's in a coma ?
ROGER: Just bloody get dressed !
PAULA: She has n't made a sound for ove an hour .
ROGER: We should break down the door .
COLIN: How many pills did she take ?
MILTON: Oh , Jesus , who knows ? I was n't counting . COLIN knocks gently .
COLIN: Marilyn ? There is no reply .
ROGER: That 's her window .
COLIN: I 'll open the door once I 'm inside .
MARILYN: Oh hi , Colin .
COLIN: Are you okay ? Everyone was worried about you .
MARILYN: Phooey .
COLIN: It 's me . She 's fine but I 'm going to keep an eye on her . I 'll sleep on the sofa .
OFF: Come on , Colin , open up .
COLIN: I ca n't find the key . You can all go to bed now .
OFF: Colin , open this door ! She needs me
MARILYN: Colin ? What are you doing here ?
COLIN: I came in through the window He realises this does n't sound reassuring .
MARILYN: The window ? Is there a balcony , like in Romeo And Juliet ? How omantic . But I 'm not sick . What makes them think that ?
COLIN: Please do n't take any more pills .
MARILYN: My mom .
COLIN: Abraham Lincoln ?
MARILYN: I do n't know who my father is so it might as well be him . Why not ? I can pick any father I want . She smiles , then looks at Colin wistfully .
COLIN: Yes , I do .
MARILYN: And a mother and father who still live together ?
COLIN: Yes .
MARILYN: And do they love you ?
COLIN: I 'm sure they do . He nods . She smiles sadly .
MARILYN: You 're lucky .
COLIN: Yes .
MARILYN: I 'm not Greek .
COLIN: Mr. Miller loves you .
MARILYN: I found his notebook . It said I 'd let him down .
COLIN: Writers scribble all kinds of things . It does n't mean anything . She looks at him , her eyes full of pain .
MARILYN: He wanted me to find it . It said he should never have married me . That I was unpredictable and a woman-child , flighty and self- centred . He 's left me , Colin . Why do the people I love always leave me ?
COLIN: I 'll never leave you .
MARILYN: All people ever see is Marilyn Monroe . As soon as they realise I 'm not her , they run .
COLIN: I do n't want to . I love you , Marilyn .
MARILYN: What 's the matter ? Do n't you want to make love ?
COLIN: Maybe we should just be friends .
MARILYN: Okay . Friends .
COLIN: Who 's Johnny ?
MARILYN: Johnny Hyde . My agent , back in the old days . He was thin , like you
COLIN: Marilyn ? She mutters softly in reply .
BLURRED: Okay . He smiles and turns out the light .
MARILYN: `` I found a dream and lay in you arms the whole night through I 'm yours no matter what others may say or do
OLIVIER: Morning , boy . Christ , you look rough . He looks at him thoughtfully , then shrugs .
COLIN: Oh , I 'm pretty sure she 'll be in this morning . OLIVIER gives COLIN an odd look .
ORTON: Cut it there !
OLIVIER: Whatever it was you did to her , oy , keep doing it .
PAULA: From the first moment all I have felt is Olivier 's loathing and contempt . He thinks I 'm unnecessary . Me , her drama coach , surrogate mother , nursemaid . On call 24 hours a day to help he act , dole out pills , bolster he ego , keep her sober enough to work . Me . Unnecessary . No me , no Marilyn .
MARILYN: You think I can act , do n't you , Colin ?
COLIN: Of course I do . You were wonderful today .
PAULA: Marilyn 's tired now .
MARILYN: I want him to stay with me .
MILTON: What would Arthur say if he knew Colin was here ?
COLIN: You heard what she said . She wants me here .
PAULA: You have no idea of your position in the world , Marilyn . You are the greatest actress there 's ever been . Not just actress . The greatest woman of this or any time . I love you like a daughter . COLIN is surprised to see tears in her eyes .
MARILYN: I 'm so tired of feeling scared . Life is so shitty . I hate it . It hurts too much .
COLIN: I 'm here now . I 'll look afte you .
MARILYN: Good old Colin . Looking after me , looking after Larry , looking afte Vivien . Always putting everyone efore yourself .
ROGER: The doctor 's coming .
COLIN: Marilyn , unlock the door .
OFF: Do n't let anyone in .
COLIN: I wo n't .
PAULA: Marilyn ! Marilyn , my baby , what has Colin done to you ?
COLIN: I have n't done anything . She 's just got a stomach ache . He reddens with embarrassment . ROGER coughs .
ROGER: I think he means her monthlies .
PAULA: What will Arthur say if she dies ?
COLIN: She 's not dying , for Christ 's sake .
CONNELL: I 'm Dr. Connell . Is the patient in there ?
PAULA: Please save her it 's Marilyn Monroe . You ca n't let her die .
CONNELL: Perhaps you 'd all like to give us a little privacy ?
MILTON: Happy now , kid ?
CONNELL: Who 's in charge here ?
PAULA: She 'll be safe with me .
CONNELL: Well , goodnight then . COLIN holds the door open as he gets in .
COLIN: Was she really pregnant ?
CONNELL: I think that 's a private matte etween Mr and Mrs. Miller .
MARILYN: We have to say goodbye now , Colin . Arthur 's on his way back . When this film is over I 'm going to settle down and be a good wife to him . I 'm going to learn to make Matzo ball soup as good as his dad 's . She smiles wistfully at the fantasy .
COLIN: I do n't want to forget .
MARILYN: What do you want to do ? Marry me ?
COLIN: Why not ? You could come and live at my parents place . You 'd love it . It 's a castle , like in a fairy tale . We would n't even have to live together . You could have your own suite of rooms
MARILYN: This is what I 've worked for my whole life . I could n't just give it all up .
COLIN: Why not , when it drives you crazy ?
MARILYN: You think I 'm crazy ?
COLIN: I did n't mean that . I just meant you could be happy .
MARILYN: I am happy . I got everything I ever dreamed about .
COLIN: Of course you 're happy . You 're a star . The biggest sta in the world .
MARILYN: Well , maybe just a wink . Once in a while .
COLIN: They 're ready for you on set , Si Laurence .
OLIVIER: Marilyn ?
COLIN: She 's just arrived .
OLIVIER: Only an hour late . Not bad by he standards .
SYBIL THORNDIKE: First love is such sweet despair , Colin .
ORTON: Very quiet , studio ! Going for a take .
DENYS: Camera running ! Speed !
MILTON: If you 'd all like to step this way , you 'll find something I think you 'll like .
JACOBS: It 's been a lot of fun , kids . See you at the Academy Awards .
COLIN: Are n't you going to throw yours away ?
LUCY: Of course not . It 's from Marilyn Monroe . He smiles . She shrugs and turns to leave .
COLIN: Lucy ? She turns back to look at him .
LUCY: I 'm washing my hair .
COLIN: A little .
LUCY: Good . It needed breaking .
OLIVIER: `` You do look , my son , in a moved sort/As if you were dismay 'd be cheerful , sir./Our revels now are ended .
COLIN: Prospero .
SMILES: We are such stuff/As dreams are made on , and our little life/Is ounded with a sleep ''
COLIN: You should tell her that .
OLIVIER: Oh , I will . But she wo n't believe me . That 's probably what makes her great . It 's certainly what makes her so profoundly unhappy . He smiles wryly .
COLIN: I thought you hated all that Royal Court stuff .
SMILES: Miller made me see things differently . You have to find new worlds to conquer , if you want to be the best . And elieve me , most of the time , I eally am the best . He goes to the door and pauses .
COLIN: Run it again , please .
MARILYN: Buy a girl a drink ?
COLIN: Can I get another one of those please , Barry ?
MARILYN: I did n't want to leave without saying goodbye .
COLIN: As if I could .
MARILYN: Everyone else on the picture wishes they could .
COLIN: Everyone else does n't understand . She smiles , touched .
MARILYN: Be a gentleman and walk me to my car ?
COLIN: What 's that for ?
MARILYN: That 's for being on my side ; and emember , when you see me wink , that 's for you .
ROGER: Looking a couple of inches talle than when I first saw you .
BARRY: Was that really Marilyn Monroe ?
COLIN: No - just a good friend of mine .
SECRETARY: It 's probably just someone having a joke .
COLIN: Did she say anything ?
SECRETARY: She just asked you to call . It is a joke , is n't it ? COLIN stares down at the paper .
COLIN: Probably . Book a call as soon as you can . Los Angeles , California . Brentwood 1890 .
OPERATOR: Your call to Los Angeles .
