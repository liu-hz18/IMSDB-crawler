THIPLETTE: I came out to see how you all were doing .
BARNETT: I think I should tell you I know why you 're here . The answer is no we do n't get involved in politics .
TRIPLETTE: Well , that 's not entirely true , Barnett . At least not according to Haven .
BARNETT: Haven ? Hell , ' we 've been playing poker together since we were fourteen .
TRIPLETTE: I guess that 's why he thought you ight want to help out .
BARNETT: He knows better .
TRIPLETTE: Well , it 's probably because it would help him .
BARNETT: How is that ?
TRIPLETTE: Everybody likes to be as good as their word .
BARNETT: Whose word ?
TRIPLETTE: His Word .
BARNETT: His word ? Are you telling me Haven promised you something ?
TRIPLETTE: That 's pretty close . He 's going to e on the bill . Why not put Barbara Jean on with him ?
BARBARA JEAN: Barnett..
BARNETT: Get her feet up .
BARBARA JEAN: Oh , Barnett , I 'm so sorry .
BARNETT: Honey , it 's okay How do you feel now ?
BARBARA JEAN: All those people She fights back the tears .
BARNETT: Do n't worry , I 'll take care or it
BARBARA JEAN: You 're so good . He blows her a kiss and steps from the bus .
BARNETT: She 's fine now , folks . Just too soon after the hospital , I guess . She wo n't be able to continue and she 's in the bus crying her eyes out , because she does n't want to disappoint the people who love he the most .
TRIPLETTE: Come on , come on . You do n't want to waste your energy on that fool .
GLENN: She 's frail . You never saw anybody so frail . I 've seen her breathe hard just standing still , dammit . You 're selfish . Worst selfish I 've eve heard . What if she died ? Would you like that ? You 'd probably say she faked it so they could make money . Well , you 're just dumb .
TRIPLETTE: We could invite them to the park .
BARNETT: What ?
TRIPLETTE: They can come to the concert in the park .
BARNETT: I said 'no ! '
TRIPLETTE: Absolutely . Listen , Barnett , I understand your position .
BARNETT: No , you do n't , so do n't say you do . Bunch of damn liars . What do you get out or this ?
TRIPLETTE: Nothing ; Barnett . It 's my job .
BARNETT: Your job , huh .
MAN: Barnett ?
BARNETT: What ?
MAN: Well , Barnett , I have this terrific song I 've been working on . It would e a natural for Barbara Jean . Like you to take a look at it . BARNETT looks at him suspiciously .
BARNETT: I 'm very busy right now . Get me Haven .

MICKEY: I have n't had a key lime pie in ten years .
MABEL: When ya had it , did ya like it ?
MICKEY: No , but that do n't mean much . I was a completely different person ten years ago . Let 's give key lime a day in court . And a large glass of milk . Mabel turns to her right .

OTIS: Hells Bells ! Do n't stop now sugar . I 'm just getting warmed up .
SONNY: Hey , I think she 's sweet on you .
MICKEY: Just because my woman 's mopping up the floor with your buddy is no reason fo you to join in .
MALLORY: Eanie , meanie , minie , moe , catch a nigger by the tow . If he hollers , let him go . Eanie , meanie , minie , moe . My mom told me to pick the best one and you are it .

SCAGNETTI: And where do you keep Mickey ?
WURLITZER: We got his stinkin ' ass in the deepest , darkest cell in the whole place . But it just so happens that right now he 's got a special visitor .
SCAGNETTI: Who ?
WURLITZER: Wayne Gayle .
SCAGNETTI: Wayne Gayle !
WAYNE: Testing onetwothree testingonethreeover , over , over , Mickey Knox meeting .
MICKEY: Everybody knows who you are . You 're famous . Wayne pauses and retorts .
WAYNE: I could say the same thing about you . I want to thank you very much fo seeing me Mickey is silent .
MICKEY: Did you ever do one on Wayne Gacy ?
WAYNE: Yes .
MICKEY: Whose ratings were higher ?
WAYNE: Yours .
MICKEY: How 'bout Ted Bundy ? Ever do one on him ?
WAYNE: Yes . Yours got the larger Nielson share .
MICKEY: Goodyuppie piece of shit .
WAYNE: What I 'd like to do-
MICKEY: How 'bout Manson ?
WAYNE: Manson beat you .
MICKEY: Yeah , it 's pretty hard to beat the king .
WAYNE: We 've been waiting to do a follow up episode on you for a long time . And that time has definitely come . I feel it 's apparent to anyone who 's hip to what 's going on that the prison oard has thrown the constitution straight out the fuckin ' window . You and Mallory may be killers , but you 're not insane . You belong in a prison , not in an asylum . The prison oard is blatantly railroading you into a hospital for the sole purpose of turning you into vegetables . Now some people are saying , 'So what ? ' I am not one of those people . If we avert ou eyes while they do this to you , we give them permission to do it again wheneve they see fit . Today they wipe clean your mind because they feel you actions are dangerous , tomorrow they wipe clean my mind because they feel what I say is dangerous . Where does it all stop ? No response from Mickey .
MICKEY: Have you talked to Mallory about this ?
WAYNE: She wo n't even see me , Mickey . Now you 're not supposed to know anything about what 's going on with her , but I 'm gon na tell ya somethin ' . Since you two 've been sentenced , Mallory has n't spoken one word .
MICKEY: She does n't talk ?
WAYNE: Not to anybody . She sings .
MICKEY: She sings ? What does she sing ?
WAYNE: Songs . 'He 's A Rebel ' , 'Leader Of The Pack ' , 'Town Without Pity ' , that Dusty Springfield song ' I Only Want To Be With You ' . That 's what I hear anyway . Her behaviour was the main thing the doctors ' report used against you . So even if she would see me , which she wo n't , I could n't put her on camera anyway . If I ask her , 'Mallory , are you insane ? ' And she starts singing 'Dead Skunk In The Middle Of The Road ' , that blows our whole case . Mickey cracks a smile . The guards come over to take him away .
MICKEY: I remember every meal we ever ate . I emember your cooking . I especially emember your casseroles . I remembe watching David Letterman . We hear the echo of television laughter .
WAYNE: 'After taking a few days to reflect on your offer , I 've come to the conclusion that you are one hundred percent correct . A national TV interview would e very advantageous to both Mallory and I . The only obstacle is they 're shipping me out to the funny farm in four days . However , that is you problem and not mine . I feel confident you 'll manage . Here 's to us making television history . Sincerely , Mickey Knox . '
ROGER: This is Raymond Burr witnessing the destruction of Tokyo by Godzilla . Everybody laughs .
SCOTT: What 's the schedule , mein fuehre ?
WAYNE: We got tonight and tomorrow to get ou shit together . The day after that they 're shippin ' Mallory . That 's when we do the Mickey Knox interview , 'cause the next day he goes .
SCOTT: Would the network really not run it without the interview ?
WAYNE: Are you kidding ? The last thing they expected was Mickey Knox to get up close and personal . They wanted a follow up episode and would 've taken anything I had given them . I 'm not gon na tell Mickey Knox that . I 'm gon na make him think his grey matter depends on it . When I told Woody and the brass about this coup , they practically shit a brick . I 'm talkin ' an adobe brick . They want to expand the show to a hour , and they want it on immediately .
ROGER: How immediate is immediately ?
WAYNE: Next week 's episode .
ROGER: We do n't got enough footage for a hou follow up .
SCOTT: What he said .
WAYNE: Rape and pillage the first episode , just change the order a bit . Those sons of bitches out there ai n't gon na know the difference . All that shit is just filler for the interview anyway . We film a new intro . Show some old footage from the first episode so the get a brief history of Mickey and Mallory . We introduce a new angle what the prison board is up to . We see some of that new shit , then the est of the show is the interview . Now what 's so fuckin ' hard about that ? Oh , Julie make a note I need Woody to get me thirty seconds of the 'Live at Five ' oadcast to promote next weeks show . We 'll do a feed right from the jail while we 're wrapping up with Mickey .
SCOTT: Betacam with remote and two-way comm link . Got it . How about the interviewWhat camera do you want to use ? Wayne closes his eyes .
WAYNE: I seehigh contrast sixteen millimetre black and white , and I mean lack and white , where the black 's lack and the white 's white . This is for posterity , so fuck video . Film ! Film ! Film !
SCOTT: When do you want the assembly ?
WAYNE: Tomorrow .
SCOTT: Well , basically , what we did was put part of the old show on first
ROGER: But we changed the order around so it was n't super obvious
SCOTT: Then we added the new shit to the tail
ROGER: So we film the interview , and we can just slap it on at the end . Wayne and Unruly Julie grab chairs and sit .
WAYNE: Okay , let 's see it .
WAYNE: Mickey and Mallory 's idea of an armed obbery was a little different than most . It was an assault , actually .
BISHOP: Well . I knew that Mickey and Mallory kill everybody when they 're through , except for one clerk . There were a couple of people in the store then , and I was working with Stevo . And I like Stevo , you know ? But I was thinking , what could I do to make them pick me to e the clerk that gets to live ?
MICKEY: Money ! Money ! Money ! Fast ! Fast ! Faster ! Faster ! Faster than that !
WAYNE: Sick , is n't it ? After killing numerous people , the would always leave one clerk alive . One clerkto give them the money , and tell the tale of-
DALE: This '68 Cadillac Coupe De Ville pulled up about three spaces away . Gerald came walking out with our coffee and- my bear claw . When the driver of the car asked him something , Gerald started giving him what looked like street directions . When he finished , the driver waved him 'thanks , ' brought up a shotgun and- PHOTO BLACK & WHITE of donut shop .
WAYNE: Apparently bored with banditry and murder , the two outlaws proved what enaissance psychopaths they really are . To break up the monotony in etween bank jobs , or what have you , they started butchering whole households at random .
JUDGE STEINSMA: Mickey was surprisingly effective . When I was told I was to be the judge of this trial and then I was told Mickey Knox would be handling his own defence , I got a headache that lasted five days . But at first I breathed a sigh of relief . Mickey showed up very prepared , and proved to be an excellent amateur lawyer .
WAYNE: Judge Steinsma said that Mickey showed up very prepared and proved to be an excellent amateur attorney .
BISBING: Oh , that 's rich . Well , considering that Mickey Knox turn his court into a mockery and personally made him look like a fool , I 'd say that 's very enevolent of Judge Steinsma . As fa as Mickey being an excellent amateu lawyer , maybe I 'm old fashioned , but when I went to law school , we were taught the object was to win the case , which I did .
WAYNE: The nation caught fire to Mickey and Mallory fever , Mickey and Mallory mania , if you will , as the merits to Mickey 's talent as a defence attorney ecame apparent . Law students from all ends of the country converged on Los Angeles as legal history took a new course . But that was only the lemon next to the pie . And that pie is you , the American people . That pie is the way the strangely charismatic , and make no mistake , they are charismatic , Mickey and Mallory have captured the public 's interest , fear , and in some cases , admiration .
CHUCK: Hot .
JEFF: Hot .
STEVE: Totally hot .
CHUCK: Mickey and Mallory 's the best thing to happen to mass murder since Manson .
STEVE: Forty-eight people known . They 're way cooler than Manson .
WAYNE: What do you think of Mickey and Mallory ?
MORGAN: Well , he 's justI dunno charismatic .
PAGE: They 're so romantic . CUT TO Wayne interviewing an INTENSE COP .
WAYNE: Yes .
RUSSELL: Ahhh yesss , I 've been fortunate enough to attend two days . Law history in the making . I 've been a participant .
WAYNE: And you being a Harvard law student , what is your opinion of Mickey Knox 's performance ?
RUSSELL: Ahhh , Mickey 's pistolero savvy in the courtroom trial rivals , dare I say conquers that of master Melvin Belli . He 's like a magnificent loose cannon , firing point blank in the prosecutor 's face . It is my anticipation-
WAYNE: You 're talking about a man and a woman who killed innocent people .
STEVE: Do n't get us wrong
CHUCK: We respect human life an ' all .
JEFF: It 's a tragedy .
STEVE: Butif I was a serial killer , which I 'm not , but if I was , I 'd be like Mickey .
MARVIN: They 're like that crazy mother in the first Dirty Harry movie . Member that crazy ass mother ? They 're like him . Mickey and Mallory be doin ' some cold-blooded shit . When I hear about some of the shit they be doin ' on TV , I say 'Damn , that 's fucked up . '
PAGE: We sit in the courtroom all day and try to catch Mickey 's eye .
WAYNE: What do you think of Mickey and Mallory ?
SIMON: I admire them .
NORMAN: I do , too .
WAYNE: But how can you say that ?
SIMON: They 're mesmerising .
NORMAN: Hypnotizing .
SIMON: Have you seen 'Pumping Iron ? '
WAYNE: Yes .
NORMAN: Then you 've seen the scene where Arnold Schwartzenegger is talking to Lou Ferigno .
WAYNE: Yes .
SIMON: Through the power of the simple word-
NORMAN: And a snake-eye glare .
SIMON: -and a snake-eye glare , Arnold was able to totally psyche out any confidence Ferigno had .
NORMAN: He squashed him mentally before physically defeating him .
SIMON: He had the edge . The mind 's edge .
NORMAN: Mickey and Mallory have that edge .
SIMON: Only on a much grander scale .
NORMAN: They 've hypnotized the nation .
SIMON: Schwartzenegger was the king of the edge before they came along . The CU of the brothers ZOOMS back .
WAYNE: You say this and yetyou two are oth victims of Mickey and Mallory .
SIMON: Yes .
NORMAN: Yes .
WAYNE: How can you say that you 'admire ' them ?
NORMAN: It 's like this , Wayne . Two people are standing in a dark room waiting for the other to attack . These two people ca n't see each other , yet they know they 're there . Now , they can eithe stand in the dark room forever waiting until they die of boredom , or one of them can make the first move .
WAYNE: Why ca n't they just shake hands and be friends ?
NORMAN: They ca n't because neither knows if the other is a deranged senseless kille like the Knoxs . So , you may as well make the first move .
WAYNE: And they made the first move ?
NORMAN: Unfortunately , yes .
SIMON: But you see , that 's okay , Wayne .
WAYNE: Why ?
SIMON: They passed the 'edge ' along to us .
WAYNE: How so ?
SIMON: By taking away our legs . Now we have to fight harder to get ahead than anyone else you 'll find in this gym . Probably the whole city . They gave us the fighting spirit . Before this happened I was content . Now I 'm pissed off . Now I 'm half a man and I 've got to work like the devil to get whole again .
WAYNE: But you 'll never be whole again .
SIMON: Never is a very long time , Wayne . A word only the weak use . I 'm not a sore loser . Even if I do n't have a leg to stand on , I 'm going to get up and fight this world until I 'm on top again .
NORMAN: That 's the Mickey and Mallory way .
SIMON: That 's the way of the world .
NORMAN: They 're shocking the world into emembering the primal law .
SIMON: Survival of the fittest .
WAYNE: One last question . Usually Mickey and Mallory kill all of their victims . Why did they let you two survive ? The brothers pause , then turn to Wayne .
NORMAN: They had us tied down during one of their house raids , you 've seen the headlines , and they were taking a chainsaw to our legs before they were gon na kill us .
SIMON: Just for fun , I guess .
NORMAN: And then Mallory stops Mickey and says , 'Hey , these are the Brothers Hun . '
SIMON: Mickey stops sawin ' on my leg and says , 'Oh my God , I 'm your biggest fan ! '
NORMAN: Apparently , they 've seen all our films .
SIMON: They were especially influenced by 'Conquering Huns of Neptune . '
NORMAN: So , Mallory calls 911 and they took off .
SIMON: They actually apologized .
WAYNE: The couple proved so popular that a motion picture glamorizing thei exploits was made
MOVIE MICKEY: I 'm gettin ' off this minimum wage train . Break my back for you and throw away my youth for nothing . when I 'm thirty , have a big wall drop down in front of me called the future . Realize I 've been doin ' time in a burge flippin ' jail . He rips off his uniform .
MOVIE MALLORY: I need ya , Mickey . I got ta have ya . I 'm no good for no one else . when I 'm with you , I burn , baby . Burn like blue flame .
MOVIE COP: When society catches up with you , I 'd hate to be in your boots .
MOVIE MICKEY: Let me telly ya about society and its oots . It uses those boots fo steppin ' on people like me and her !
NEIL POPE: It is my belief that Mickey and Mallory Knox are a cultural phenomena that could only exist in our sexually epressed society . A flower that could only bloom amidst a grotesque fast food culture . A what I tried to do with 'Thrill Killers ' was trace the root of the problem all the way down the vine to the original bad seed . Yet amidst the violence and murder and carnage , you 've got the structure of a Wagnerian love story .
MOVIE MALLORY: Mickey , honey , listen to me .
MOVIE MICKEY: I 'm not saying it 's not gon na hurt , ut
MOVIE MALLORY: I ca n't run with you , Mickey ! I really want to . If I could , I would , but I ca n't . I got ta stay here . But you can still get out of here .
MOVIE MICKEY: No fuckin ' way ! No fuckin ' way !
MOVIE MALLORY: If they stay , they 'll catch you , and they do n't have to catch you-
MOVIE MICKEY: No fuckin ' way !
MOVIE MALLORY: Mickey , you 're wasting time !
MOVIE MICKEY: I do n't give a damn if a million United States marines , all whistling the halls of Montezuma , are gon na come marchin ' down this alley any second . There ai n't not fuckin ' way in hell I 'm leaving you . And that 's that !
MOVIE MALLORY: Mickey , my love , if you leave me , they 'll catch me and take me to the hospital . If you stay , you 'll make 'em kill you . Then it 'd be like I killed you . I could bear anything , but I could n't bear that . So please , please , for me , my handsome husband , run for your life . The SIRENS and CHOPPERS draw closer .
MOVIE MICKEY: I ca n't do it . You 're my wife , you 're my partner . A fella does n't run when his partner ca n't run with him . Mallory , my angel , if I could of left ya , I 'd of left ya a long time ago . They kiss .
MOVIE MALLORY: Well , hell , if you wo n't leave , give me a gun so I can go out shooting .
MOVIE MICKEY: Sit tight . I 'm gon na make it a little tougher for 'em .
MOVIE MALLORY: Mickey ! Movie Mickey 's busy . He does n't turn around .
MOVIE MICKEY: Yeah baby .
MOVIE MALLORY: You made every day like kindergarten . Movie Mallory pulls the trigger . BANG !
MOVIE MICKEY: Mallory !
NEIL POPE: It was dramatic license , no doubt . But I felt an operatic love story needed an operatic ending . The two of them kill for each other . They offer the death of their victims to each other like other lovers offer flowers or bon bons . So what more natural , what more organic , what more poetic than Mallory offering her death to Mickey ? It 's where it 's been leading since day one . We worked it in the movie by using a what if they escaped situation . I think it works beautifully . You 'd be surprised . People come up to me at the end of the movie in tears .
JESSIE: One thing about Mickey for sure , he 's definitely a man who has his moments . It was wild playin ' him . It was one of those get-it-out-of-your-system performances .
BUFFY: I did n't play Mallory , the murderer . I did n't play her as a butcher . I played her as a woman in love , who also happens to murder people . I did n't want her to be at arm 's length from the audience or myself . If you play her as this wild maniac , the audience neve has to deal with her . If you see a decapitation in a movie , you just say 'Oh wow , a neat special effect . ' Because you ca n't relate to a decapitation . It does n't mean anything to anybody because it 's not personal . Decapitations do n't fall into most people 's realm of life experiences . But if you show somebody in a movie getting a paper cut , the whole audience squirms . Because everybody can relate to a paper cut .
JESSIE: Yeah , I visited him when he was up in Susanville . He 's a little cerebral fo my taste , but all in all , we got along .
WAYNE: Can you shed some light , Docto Reinghold , on why the public has taken a pair of sociopaths so close to thei osom ?
DR. REINGHOLD: Well , for one , the media has done a tremendous job of turning the husband and wife mass murderers into celebrities . But it 's the country 's youth who have turned the couple into the ultimate anti-heroes . Basically , the very thing that makes them most lethal is the exact same thing that captures the public 's hearts and minds Mickey and Mallory 's operatic devotion to each other . In a world where people ca n't seem to make the simplest relationships work and the slightest emotional commitment is considered devastating , Mick and Mallory have a do-or-die romance of a Shakespearean magnitude . To the country 's youth , 75 percent of which are coming from broken homes , that 's appealing . They have an 'us against the world ' posture which always appeals to youth . And they 've taken that posture seventeen steps beyond . It 's not 'us against the world , ' it 's 'we 're gon na kill the world . ' They 're exciting . I read their file and I find myself turning the page like it was a paperback . Why do disillusioned youths get into Mickey and Mallory ? Why do disillusioned housewives read romance novels ? Why are you filming this special ? Because you know as well as I do , you say 'tonight at nine Charles Manson speaks , ' everybody 's going to tune in to hear what he says . Mickey and Mallory have shocked a country num with violence . They 've created a world where only two exist and anybody who inadvertently enters that world is murdered .
LONDON BOY: You take all the great figures from the StatesElvis , Jack Keroac , Bukowski , James Dean , Jim Morrison , Angela Davis , Jack Nicholson , Jim Thompson , Martin Scorceseadd a loody pale of nitro and you got Mickey and Mallory . They 're like rebels without a cause , except they have a cause . Only nobody knows what it is .
LONDON GIRL: Their cause is each utter !
FRENCH BOY: They are super cool !
WAYNE: And as to almost give this whole misplaced admiration scenario a cherry on the top , the rock band Redd Kross entered the charts last week at numbe 13 with their song 'Natural Born Killers , The Saga of Mickey and Mallory . '
TRANSIENT: Did ya watch your brother get stabbed up ?
WAYNE: How do you feel about Mickey cross- examining you ?
MICKEY: I 'm keen with anticipation .
MALLORY: I ai n't never had so much fun .
CUTE REPORTER: Do you have any regrets ?
MALLORY: Not a one .
MICKEY: Yeah , I always regretted we never got around to looking up my old history teacher , Miss Bainbridge . Now there 's a big bad bitch not good for herself o nobody .
BLACK REPORTER: What 's your favorite pastime ?
MICKEY: You mean aside from what I 'm being tried for ? Mallory playfully elbows Mickey in his ribs .
REPORTERS: What 's your favorite show ?
MICKEY: 'Have Gun Will Travel . '
CUTE REPORTER: Do you have anything to say to you fans ?
MICKEY: You ai n't seen nothin ' yet .
WAYNE: No , apparently we had not seen everything . Grace Mulberry gave he tearful testimony . Then it became Mickey Knox 's turn for cross- examination .
MICKEY: That 's one helluva story , Miss Mulberry . CU of Grace .
GRACE: Yes it is .
MICKEY: GraceI hope you do n't mind if I call you Grace
MALLORY: Naw , she do n't mind .
MICKEY: Grace . I 'd like to talk to you about your murdered brother Tim , if you feel up to it .
GRACE: More or less .
MICKEY: More or less BACK TO Mickey .
GRACE: Well , he 's my older brother . When we were growing up , there were times we could of very well done without each other . But when it counted , we were close .
MICKEY: I 'd like to talk about Tim 's martial arts abilities . How long had he been studying ?
GRACE: He started when he was in the seventh grade , so that would make it nine years . PAN CONTINUES back into shadows , then
MICKEY: When you study the martial arts , they give out belts that come in different colors to signify what level you 're at in your training . Am I correct on that point ?
GRACE: Yes you are .
MICKEY: What was the color of Tim 's belt ?
GRACE: The style of fighting that Tim studied did n't believe in belts .
MICKEY: Is that a fact ? Well then , Grace , could you tell us what form of martial arts it was that Tim was schooled in ?
GRACE: Tim studied several styles , but his favorite was Jeet Kune Do .
MICKEY: Jeet Kune DoNow I did some research on that form of fighting , and I found out that Jeet Kune Do was a style developed by Bruce Lee . Did you know that ?
GRACE: Yes , I did . That 's why Tim studied it . Because it was Bruce Lee 's fighting style .
MICKEY: Now , while I freely admit total ignorance on the subject , I have heard of Bruce Lee . And I was under the impression that Bruce Lee was one of
GRACE: That 's what Tim said .
MICKEY: So , I think it would be safe to say that anybody who studied the fighting style that Bruce Lee , arguably the greatest martial artist of all times , developed for nine years , that would be a fella who could defend himself . Would you describe Tim that way , Grace ?
GRACE: Yes , I would .
MICKEY: Point of fact , were n't Tim 's hands egistered as lethal weapons ?
GRACE: Yes , they were . CU of Mickey 's hand holding the pencil .
MICKEY: That means his hands are considered a weapon like a gun or a knife . Am I correct on that point ?
GRACE: Yes , you are . CU of Mallory cracking a slight smile .
MICKEY: Yet , in your testimony just now , you described that Tim
BISBING: Objection , defence is intimidating the witness with the murder weapon .
GRACE: I do n't know how you did it , but you did it !
JUDGE STEINSMA: Mr. Knox ! The knife !
MICKEY: How do you think a human being could possibly be capable of doing something like that ? Mickey locks eyes with eyes .
GRACE: I do n't know ! Mickey is on top of her .
MICKEY: NowI do n't believe that Grace . I think you have a definite opinion on how I was able to do those things you described . Now , I 'm going to ask you again . And I want you to remember you are under oath . Grace collects herself .
GRACE: You 're not human . Mickey smiles .
MICKEY: Thank you . Grace , there is one othe thing
GRACE: What Mickey smiles .
MICKEY: You 're right .
MALLORY: Show off . Mickey smiles and glances toward Judge .
MICKEY: No further questions your honor .
DEPUTY #1: Light 's out Prick . Deputy swings the club .
WAYNE: Was there any vengeance on your part with your unique sentence ?
JUDGE STEINSMA: Yes , unquestionably . After they did what they did in my court , and judge worth his robe will tell you the same thing . It could n't help but affect my decision . That 's why they have judges . We 're supposed to be fair to a fault , ut when it 's showtime , we have to make a decision . That 's why we do n't just input all the facts into a computer fo the appropriate punishment . I could n't give them the death penalty . See , California hops back and forth on that issue . Mickey and Mallory went to court when it was out of favor , which is actually good because it leaves more oom for imagination . Anybody can give somebody the chair . When you have someone who deserves to die and you ca n't kill them , you have to be creative . And if the bastards had let it stand , it would of been the perfect sentence . It hit 'em right where they lived . Far more punishing than the death sentence .
WAYNE: Would you please describe for ou viewers what your sentence was ?
JUDGE STEINSMA: Well , in a rogue 's gallery of killers , Mickey and Mallory are very unique . I 've seen a lot of killers in my day and they 're a very cold lot . They have no more feelings about taking a person 's life than squashing a tiny ug . It 's all the same to them . Well , Mickey and Mallory were that 'kill 'em to watch their expression change ' attitude personified . Except with each other . And , since they lived only fo each other , I wanted to attack that , at its very root . So , in a nutshell , my sentence was double life for each without any possibility for parole . That would be fairly standard in thei case . The twist I added was that the husband and wife would have no contact or correspondence with each other fo the rest of their lives . And they would never receive any word o information about the other . So , basically once the cell door slams shut , Mickey and Mallory will completely disappear from each other 's life . They 'll never know when the other dies . But alas , the best laid plans of mice and men
WAYNE: Why are Mickey and Mallory being moved to an asylum ? And who made the decision ?
MCCLUSKY: The prison board made the decision . A oard of which I belong . We 're the who . The why is simple . Mickey and Mallory are mentally ill and need to be under a doctor 's care , where hopefully they 'll receive the help they need .
WAYNE: Mickey and Mallory were deemed competent in a mental examination efore their trial . I 'm confused . What 's changed ?
MCCLUSKY: Well , since that time , they 've killed one person during their trail . And since their incarceration , they 've killed one psychologist along with several guards and inmates .
WAYNE: When they were found competent before , they had already killed fifty people . Other than the fact they 're a disciplinary problem , which frankly should n't surprise anyone , I still do n't see where this situation is any different then it was before . So , I ask you again , Mr. McClusky , what 's changed ?
MCCLUSKY: What 's changed , Mr. Gayle , is ou minds . We felt they were competent a year ago . A year has passed , sir , a year where they were under close observation , day in and day out , and their behaviour has led us to believe we were wrong .
WAYNE: Who is we ?
MCCLUSKY: The prison board and the doctors who examined them .
WAYNE: Were any of the doctors who made the first evaluation on the Knoxs mental state asked to re-examine them ?
MCCLUSKY: Using the same doctors is not common practice .
WAYNE: I take it by your answer it was a whole new team ?
MCCLUSKY: Now that you bring it up , yes . They were different men . I had n't really thought that much about it . Since many psychiatric opinions are , by a rule , sought out for this kind of situation . What do you think normally happens ? The Knoxs are assigned a family psychologist that takes care of them throughout the rest of their lives ? The state does n't work like that . PHOTO of DR. ALBERT RODRIGUEZ .
DR. REINGHOLD: It 's a funny situation actually . If anyone besides Mickey and Mallory give a damn , what the prison board is doing would be considered an outrage . The prison board is basically saying , 'We ca n't handle these guys . ' They 've moved 'em around twice since thei sentence started . They were a handful everywhere they went . Now the prisons they 're at now want them outta there . But no othe prison 's gon na be stupid enough to take 'em . So the prison board is left scratching their heads wondering what they 're gon na do . Well , what they decided to do was to set up a kangaroo medical court that found them crazy . Then they get them transferred to Nystrom Medical Asylum or Lobotomy Bay as it 's referred to in the psychiatric circle . Put 'em on a strict dope and electro shock diet , and Mickey and Mallory cease to be a problem to anybody except the orderlies who clean out the bedpans , which if you want to see them get theirs , that 's all well and good . But there 's something being said here . Forget the immorality for a second . Forget the corruption and the skulduggery involved . What the board is saying is 'we give up . ' Mickey and Mallory ran amuck in polite society . They were put in an alternative society and they ran amuck there , too . All the powers that be , ca n't deal with these two kids . And whatever ca n't be assimilated has to be terminated .
WAYNE: So , in your opinion Mickey and Mallory are not insane ?
DR. REINGHOLD: Insane , no . Psychotic , yes . A menace to living creatures , yes . But to suggest that they 're insane gives the impression that they do n't know right from wrong . Mickey and Mallory know the difference between right and wrong . They just do n't give a damn . FREEZE FRAME on Dr. Reinghold .
WAYNE: Good work , my brothers . Fan-fuckin'- tastic ! I think that interview stuff 's too long , we can lose some of that . Keep the girls , keep the long hairs , keep the Hun brothers , keep the black guy , keep the movie shit , and keep the cop at the donut shop . Lose the rest . And cut the interview with the prison oard fellow before that . Cut it afte I ask , ' I take it by your answer it was a whole new team . ' Do n't even let him answer . Fuck him . Then cut to me talking about the two chicken shit psychiatrists and straight in Dr. Reinghold laughing .
SCOTT: Okay . Wayne puts his arm around Unruly Julie .
WAYNE: Children , we have a show . You two get some long well overdue sleep . 'Cause tomorrow , bright and early , county jail and then journey 's endMickey Knox .
MICKEY: There 's this Italian guy , a French guy , and a Polish guy . And they 're all talkin ' about how they fuck thei wives-
WAYNE: How 's it working , Scotty ?
ROGER: Where the fuck 's the chocolate cream filled ? Did anyone get my chocolate cream filled ? If you did , it 's mine . CU of Roger , looking into CAMERA .
WAYNE: You were there . Did you see him put it in a box ? We PAN back to a CU of Roger .
ROGER: At the time , I was too busy explaining to Scott the finer points of film . We ZOOM back to a WIDE SHOT .
WAYNE: You ca n't be serious ?
ROGER: I 'm as serious about that as I am about going back to the donut store , and dipping that stupid Mexican 's head into the batter for forgetting my chocolate cream filled . Gim me that other box .
WAYNE: Huh uh . This dozen is for Mickey .
ROGER: That dumbass probably put my chocolate cream filled in there by mistake .
WAYNE: Roger , no .
ROGER: What 's the big deal ? Take out my chocolate cream filled , put one of these roasted coconut-
WAYNE: Roger , do you understand what the word 'no ' means ? It 's important we establish a rapport . Something as simple as a dozen donuts can mean the world to somebody who has n't had a donut in a year .
ROGER: So you 're giving a man who butchers whole families , little babies included , my chocolate cream filled ?
WAYNE: Okay , guys , we 're here . L.A. County Jail . Julie , just park in the front .
ROGER: Wayne-
WAYNE: Roger , I 'm starting to get pissed . Just drop this fuckin ' donut shit , and gather your gear .
WURLITZER: Hello , Mr. Gayle . I 'm Phil Wurlitzer . We talked on the phone . It 's a pleasure to meet you .
WAYNE: Same here . Let me introduce my crew . ScottRogerand Unruly Julie this isI 'm sorry . What 's your title again ?
WURLITZER: I 'm the superintendent here at L.A. County Jail . Me and my deputies are who you 'll be working with while you 're here .
WAYNE: That sounds great . Look , I do n't want any of this to intimidate you . This is not going to be a big deal . This is going to be very easy . I need to talk with Mr. Wurlitzer . You guys get your equipment ready , power up the van and confirm a transmission code for the remote . Julie come with me .
WURLITZER: This is just for an interview , I was on the set of 'Dukes of Hazzard ' once . It was a much bigger deal than this . They had a crew of maybe seventy-five people . CAMERA moves to Wayne and Scott .
WAYNE: We 're gon na be talking over here . But I want enough freedom so if I wan na get up and move around , we can . Wayne grabs Scott and walks him to the left .
WURLITZER: And when it 's lunch time , they do n't just go to McDonalds . They got cooks there servin ' great food . Swedish meatballs Wayne walks over to Wurlitzer and Deputies .
WAYNE: Everything 's coming along just fine . Phil , I wanted to know if I could have a small word with you .
WURLITZER: By all means .
WAYNE: You met the kids I have working for me ? Great bunch , are n't they ?
WURLITZER: Oh yes , indeed . Top flight .
WAYNE: Scott , genius cameraman , Roger , magician with sound . Unruly Julie , I could sooner do without my arm than Unruly Julie .
WURLITZER: Is that her real name ?
WAYNE: Just a little nickname . Yep , they 're my kids and they 're all I need . Afte working together these past coupla years , we 're like well-oiled machinery . No , more like a Formula race car . No , scratch that one , too . What we 're eally like is a Swiss watch . Small , intricate , compactit should n't work as well as it does , but it does . Because of the craftsmanship , the expertise , and the artist 's loving hand .
WURLITZER: I see .
WAYNE: Now , Phil , I do n't know if you 've eve een on a set before-
WURLITZER: Ya know , I was .
WAYNE: Really ?
WURLITZER: I was on the 'Dukes of Hazzard ' set about eight years ago .
WAYNE: Wellsmall world . Well , then , you know firsthand how Hollywood does things . Lights all over the place , generators , a hundred and fifty crew members-
WURLITZER: Oh , that 'Dukes of Hazzard ' show , there was probably ninety-five people there , maybe more .
WAYNE: See what I mean ? It 's a funny usiness , is n't it ?
WURLITZER: It sure is .
WAYNE: They got a asshole over here . A asshole sitting down reading a magazine over there . A asshole perched up there . Assholes everywhere . Hey , maybe if we were doin ' that kiss , kiss , bang , bang stuff we 'd need all those assholes , too . What we 're about is intimacy . We 're about two people having a conversation . Say I was interviewing you . All I want you to worry about is what I ask you . I want a trust to develop . If you 're thinking about all this you 're not going to relax , a trust wo n't develop , we 'll be talking a each other instead of to each other , there will be no chance for intimacy .
WURLITZER: Well , just what the hell do you expect me to do ?
WAYNE: Lose 'em .
WURLITZER: Mr. Gayle , do you have the slightest idea how dangerous Knox is ?
WAYNE: Mr. Wurlitzer , I assure you , I am very familiar with Mickey Knox 's career . They 're out and out angry .
WURLITZER: Since he and his wife have been in custody , they 've killed-
WAYNE: Do n't recite the fact to me . I 'm sure I know 'em better than you do .
WURLITZER: Well , let me let you in on one more fact you obviously do n't know . If I were to take my men away , Mickey Knox would snap your neck like a twig .
WAYNE: OneI can take care of myself . I grew up in a tough neighbourhood , and I 've handled some pretty rough customers in my day . Mickey Knox does n't scare me . TwoI 'm a journalist , and I 'm prepared to take that risk . Threeit ai n't gon na happen . Believe me when I tell you , it is in Mickey Knox 's own best interest to play this game according to Hoyle . Wait a minute . We 've gotten into a advisory relationship here , which is not what I want . But seriously , Phil , look at this .
WURLITZER: Wayne , if it was anybody else-
WAYNE: Phil , I 'm just scared he 's gon na clam up on me with all these sheriffs all over the place . They hate him . He hates them . What kinda intimacy am I gon na create with all this hate in the air . Even you and I feel it .
WURLITZER: What are we talking about ?
WAYNE: Two guys ?
WURLITZER: Okay . I 'll take two guys off .
WAYNE: No , no , no , no , no , no , I mean only two guys .
WURLITZER: I ca n't do that . Five guys .
WAYNE: Three .
WURLITZER: I 'll cut it in half . Four guys , but that 's it .
DEPUTY #1: On your feet ! Turn your face to the wall . Mickey gets up .
MICKEY: Now what you 're supposed to say is 'Five minutes , Mr . Knox . ' OFF SCREEN the cell door slams closed .
SCAGNETTI: Beautiful day for a drive , is n't it ?
WAYNE: And when he gets here , its no dick ' n around time . Make him up , clip a mike on him , then leave him alone . I do n't want you talking to him . I do n't want you getting in his face . I want you hiding behind your gear . You are invisible .
WURLITZER: Okay , boys , lets start undoing him .
MICKEY: Okay now , before we get started here , there 's a few things we have to get clear about .
WAYNE: All right , Mickey .
MICKEY: Let 's discuss it when I 'm unbound .
BINGHAM: Turn around and face the wall ! Mallory does . Bingham and Washington move to the door .
SCAGNETTI: Wait outside for a second , fellas .
BINGHAM: We 're not supposed-
SCAGNETTI: Do n't worry about it . Bingham and Washington move outside .
WASHINGTON: I 'll fix it .
SCAGNETTI: Hold her , boys .
MICKEY: How come you never talk ?
ROGER: She was born without a tongue .
MICKEY: Oh my God ! Sorry .
WAYNE: So we got a deal . Four deputies-
WURLITZER: And me .
WAYNE: Why do n't we make it three deputies and you ?
WURLITZER: Why do n't I have Mickey thrown back into his cell and we can forget the whole thing ?
WAYNE: Chill out , Phill . Four deputies and you , I can live with that . We 're about eady to go here , so let 's get rid of these other assholes .
WURLITZER: Do n't call my men assholes .
WAYNE: I did n't mean they were assholes . I mean if they 're leaving , get 'em outta here .
WURLITZER: This asshole 's tryin ' to tell me what I 'm gon na do in my jail . Fuck him ! This nanderfuck does n't know what he 's dealin ' with here , but we do . And if shit happens , he ai n't gon na be esponsible , we are . So keep you shotguns out , your fingers on the triggers , and be ready to fire at a moment 's notice .
ROGER: Say something .
MICKEY: What ?
ROGER: Anything .
MICKEY: I stand amid the roa Of a surf tormented shore , As I hold within my hand Grains of the golden sand How few ! yet how they creep Through my fingers to the deep , While I weepwhile I weep ! O God ! can I not save One from the pitiless wave ? Is all that we see or seem But a dream within a dream ? Mickey bites into the donut .
ROGER: Ahfine . Let me make an adjustment here , and we 'll be ready to rock ' n oll . Ohuh , the dumbass at the donut place put a chocolate cream filled I asked for in your box .
MICKEY: There 's a chocolate cream filled in there ?
ROGER: Yeah . Ya see , I ordered that special .
MICKEY: Tough titty , it 's mine now .
ROGER: Look , I 'll trade you . Wayne enters frame .
WAYNE: Roger , enough with the fucking donuts ! What did I tell you . Stop bothering Mickey , and get behind your nagra .
ROGER: Fine . Roger , what the hell are you doing ? You 're bothering the serial killer . Roger exits FRAME .
WAYNE: Sorry about that .
MICKEY: Do n't worry about it .
WAYNE: We 're about ready to go here . Are you eady ?
MICKEY: Let 's do it . Wayne smiles and exits FRAME .
WAYNE: So , Mickey , tell us what you do fo fun .
MICKEY: Aside from the obvious ? Mickey breaks out laughing .
WAYNE: Yes . Aside from the obvious . Mickey 's laughing slowly runs its course .
MICKEY: Okay , let me see now . What do I do fo fun ? Does anybody got a smoke ? You guys are drivin ' me crazy with your cigarettes . Sorry out there in TV land . I 'm just sittin ' here lookin '' at these deputies smokin ' up a storm , and it 's really doin ' it to me .
WAYNE: What ? Oh , aaahhh , what you did for fun for starters .
MICKEY: What I did for fun for starters . Well , something I used to doalways was a lot of fun No , scratch that . Let me think of something else . In fact , why do n't we come back to that question . Ask me something else .
WAYNE: Do you miss Mallory ?
MICKEY: Of course , I miss Mallory . She 's my wife . I have n't seen her in a long time . What a stupid question .
WAYNE: Then was it worth it ?
MICKEY: Was what worth it ?
WAYNE: Was massacring all those people worth eing separated from your wife for the est of your life ? Mickey takes a drag from his cigarette .
MICKEY: Do you think up these questions or the girl with no tongue ?
WAYNE: No , Mickey , I ca n't let you get away with that shit . Answer the question . Was it worth it ? You have n't seen , heard , or smelled Mallory in a year . Was it worth it ?
MICKEY: Was an instant of purity worth a lifetime lie ? Yeah , it was .
WAYNE: Excuse me , did you say an instant of purity ? What was the instant of purity ? The bodies you left behind on your bloody trail ?
MICKEY: That 's only part of it . I mean , it 's a ig , big , big part . But it 's only the chorus , it 's not the whole song .
WAYNE: Please explain to me , Mickey , where 's the purity that you could n't live without in five year old Danny Millhouse 's blown off head ? Where 's the purity in forty-eight people who are no longer on this planet because they met you and Mallory ? What 's so fucking pure about that ?
MICKEY: Where the purity comes into play-
MALLORY: Love is a hurtin ' thang , and it leaves a fiery sting .
WAYNE: You just said an instant of purity was preferrable to a lifetime lie . I do n't understand . What 's so pure about forty-eight dead bodies ?
MICKEY: You 'll never understand . Me and you , Wayne , we 're not even the same species . I used to be youthen I evolved . From where you 're standing , you 're a man . From where I 'm standing , you 're a ape . I 'm hereI 'm right here and youyou 're somewhere else , man . You say why ? I say why not ?
WAYNE: Tell me about the purity .
MICKEY: It 's not that easy , Wayne . Donuts and a smoke only get you so far . You 're gon na have to do your job .
WAYNE: OkayokayI 'll buy that . We 'll move on and come back later .
MICKEY: I 'm sure we will .
WAYNE: Describe Mallory .
MICKEY: Describe Mallory ? Okay . She 's pretty , she 's got blonde hair , two eyes , two feet , two hands , ten fingers
WAYNE: Do n't play dumb with me , Mickey . You know what I mean . Describe Mallory . What 's up here ? What 's in here ?
MICKEY: That 's indescribable .
WAYNE: Well , riddle me this , Batman . How do you feel about the fact that you 're never gon na see Mallory again ?
MICKEY: Says who ?
WAYNE: Says the United States of America .
MICKEY: When have they ever been right ? The crew laughs
SCAGNETTI: How 's it goin ' ?
WURLITZER: Shhhh ! I wan na hear this . Wurlitzer sees Scagnetti 's bandaged face .
SCAGNETTI: You should see the other bitch . What time you got ?
WURLITZER: Two-thirty . Shhh
MICKEY: But I came to the direction I need a gun . Do , the next day I started off early for work , and I 'm gon na stop by a gun shop and pick up a little home protection . I walked into the place and had never seen so many guns in all my life . So , I 'm lookin ' around , the this really nice sales guy comes up to me . His name was Warren . I 'll neve forget his name . He was really nice . Anyway , Warren showed me all these different models of guns . Magnums , automatics , pistols , Walters . And I ask to see a shotgun . He brings me a Mossberg pump action shotgun . As soon as I held that baby in my hands , I knew what I was gon na do . It felt so good . It felt like it was a part of me . They had a mirror in the store . I looked at myself holding it , and looked so fuckin ' good , I immediately bought it . Bought a bunch of boxes of ammo . Turned my car around , drove to Mallory 's house , we took care of Mallory 's parents , packed up the car , and we were off .
WAYNE: Okay , let 's cut it . BACK TO COLOR 35mm
SCOTT: It 's gon na be beautiful .
WAYNE: Super cool . This is great stuff . How ya doin ' ?
MICKEY: I could go for a Coke .
WAYNE: Could I get a Coke for Mickey ?
WURLITZER: I 'm not running out and getting that piece of shit a Coke .
WAYNE: Fine . Julie , why do n't you make a food run ? What 's around here ?
DEPUTY SHERIFF: There 's an In and Out Burgers about a lock away on Olive . It 's walking distance .
WAYNE: Okay , Julie , take everybody 's order . I 'll have a double double with cheese , french fries , and a large Coke .
WURLITZER: Are you all set ?
SCAGNETTI: Yeah . Bus is all gassed up and ready to roll .
WURLITZER: I assigned you Bingham and Washington to go along .
SCAGNETTI: Yeah , we met . They 're good men .
WURLITZER: They 're real Goddamn good . They 'll be there for when ya need 'em . Where are they ?
SCAGNETTI: Waitin ' in the lounge .
WURLITZER: How 'bout Mallory ?
SCAGNETTI: Coolin ' her jets in a holding cell .
WURLITZER: Me , neither . I do n't eat meat .
DEPUTY SHERIFF: Capt ' n !
WURLITZER: Yeah ?
DEPUTY SHERIFF: They need you . Emergency !
WURLITZER: Talk to me . Where ? For the love of Peteokayokay okay . Mobilize the men . I 'm on my way .
MICKEY: I 'll have a four by four . That 's fou patty burgers . Now they do n't have that on the menu , but if you order a four by four , they 'll know what you 're talking about . A large Coke and two orders of fries .
SCAGNETTI: Slide the shotgun over here , put you hands behind your head , put you forehead on the floor .
MICKEY: Or what ? You 'll wound me ? I can blow you in half and you know it .
SCAGNETTI: I 've never wounded anything in my life . I got you locked right between the eyes . Mickey rises .
MICKEY: If you do n't drop that toy , I 'm blowin ' you in half on three . So , if you got me locked , take the shot . One
SCAGNETTI: Hold it ! Do n't shoot !
MICKEY: Open the chamber . Empty the shells . Scagnetti does . The shells fall out .
SCAGNETTI: What ?
MICKEY: You guys stay on your bellies .
ROGER: Yes , sir .
MICKEY: I am the most dangerous man in the world .
WAYNE: Let me check on Scott . He 's hurt bad .
MICKEY: Scott 's dead . And unless you wan na play follow the leader , shut up and do as you 're told .
ROGER: Not good .
MICKEY: Do you have a back up .
ROGER: It 's video .
MICKEY: Even better . Wayne call your station , tell 'em we 're going live a little early today . Make it happen !
WURLITZER: I want two men stationed in that tier , and I want men with rifles all along the walkway .
CHAVEZ: Good afternoon , I 'm Tony Chavez and this is a KKTV Special Report . At this moment we are receiving preliminary eports of a hostage II 'm sorry . I 'm being told that we 're now taking you live to L.A. County Jail where Wayne Gayle is standing by .
WAYNE: This is Wayne Gayle reporting live from the Los Angeles County Jail , where you can tell from the bloody carnage behind me that the final chapter in the book called Mickey and Mallory has not yet een written .
MICKEY: Thank you , Wayne , but our little movie just underwent a title change . It 's now called 'The Escape of Mickey and Mallory . ' Starring me , you , Mallory , and special guest accomplice , Jack- fucked-up-fingers-Scagnetti . Okay , Donut , move in for a close up . I want this for prosperity . CAMERA ZOOMS into a CU of Scagnetti .
SCAGNETTI: She 's in the holding cell , on this floor .
CHAVEZ: Ladies and gentlemen , in case you have just tuned in , it appears that a hostage situation involving Mickey Knox is developing presently at the Los Angeles County Jail . We have seen that he is armed and apparently there has een some loss of life . We will try to e-establish contact with Wayne Gayle and bring you more on this late eaking story . Please stay tuned .
MICKEY: Okay , Jack , this is what we 're doing . Stand behind me , put your back against mine and extend your arms behind you .
SCAGNETTI: Yeah .
MICKEY: Okay , Wayne , step forward .
ROGER: Ready .
MICKEY: Wagons , hooaaa !
MALLORY: Whataleeatcha , whataleeatcha dodaleedo , dodaleedo . Whataleeatcha , whataleeatcha dodaleedo , dodaleedo . Simplest thing there is n't much to it . All ya got ta do is dodaleedo it . I like the rest , ut the best part I like is Whataleeatcha , whataleeatcha dodaleedo , dodaleedo , do quack , quack .
MICKEY: Honey , I 'm home .
MALLORY: It 's taken you so long to come to me .
WURLITZER: Wait a minute , Bailey . Where 's the list of the hostages ?
MICKEY: Okay , we 're going out that door , and we 're gon na march down the hall and ight out of the building . Donut said something about a news van .
WAYNE: Yeah , we have a van .
MICKEY: Where 's it parked ?
WAYNE: Out front .
MICKEY: Let me have the keys .
WAYNE: Mickey , can I talk to you alone ?
MICKEY: No .
WAYNE: This is crazy . You ca n't escape like this .
MICKEY: Probably not , but we 're gon na give it the old college try .
WAYNE: We 'll all be killed .
MALLORY: Exciting , is n't it ? Duncan begins to cry .
MICKEY: Now , when we get out there , you do what we say or it 's curtains . If we say move , you move . If we say left , you move left . If we say right , you move ight . If we say mole , you dig a hole . Got it ?
MALLORY: Are we in a big hurry ?
MICKEY: You got something you want to do ?
MALLORY: Yeah .
MICKEY: By all means , knock yourself out .
MALLORY: Thanks . Roll 'em , Donut .
MICKEY: We 're sending out a hostage . Do n't touch him ! OFF SCREEN the door is kicked open .
MALLORY: Mickey !
MICKEY: Do n't stop ! Roger 's CAMERA runs along with them .
DUNCAN: Please do n't kill me ! Do n't kill me
MICKEY: This way .
DUNCAN: Th the ground floor .
MALLORY: Is that the front door ? Duncan nods frantically .
MICKEY: Let 's go .
MALLORY: Back off or I 'll blast him ! Back off or I 'll blast him ! Back off or I 'll last him !
WAYNE: Do n't shoot . I beg you , do n't shoot ! Please , please , please Wayne continues begging . Wurlitzer steps forward .
WURLITZER: Now Mickey , Mallory , just let me say-
MALLORY: Shut up ! Do n't talk , I do n't wan na hear it !
WURLITZER: You have to know-
MALLORY: I said shut up
MICKEY: Thinkthinkthink
MALLORY: Look , lover boy , we 're not getting outta here . So I say the hell with going back to our cells . Let 's do a Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid . Run down these stairs shootin ' , go out in a hail of bullets , but take as many of those motherfuckers with us as possible .
MICKEY: We 'll do that when all else fails . Mickey stands .
MALLORY: Has n't it ?
MICKEY: We still got a few tricks up ou sleeves .
DUNCAN: Oh , I do n't wan na die
MICKEY: Are you married ? Do you have kids ? Duncan nods pathetically .
WAYNE: What would I do ? Me and my network would sue the entire Los Angeles County Sheriffs Department for flagrantly disregarding my safety . I 'd go straight to my buddy , the mayor , and make sure everyone of those son of a itches down there ends up on the unemployment line . In fact , I 'd sue every man down there personally . I would make it my life 's ambition to ing the LA County Jail to its knees . I would do expose after expose on the utality , and the conditions , and the inhumanity that exists here .
MICKEY: That 's what I thought . You tell them that . When we go down those stairs , I want you to scream what you just told me . 'My name is Wayne Gayle ! I am the star of American Maniacs watched every week by ' how many people ?
WAYNE: On average forty million .
MICKEY: 'Every week by forty million people . I am a respected journalist . ' Have you won any awards ?
WAYNE: Are you kidding ? The Golden Globe , The Edward R. Murrow award
MICKEY: 'Respected journalist ' On you knees
WAYNE: Yes .
MICKEY: Say it . Scream it . All the way out the front door and into your van . And if you stop screaming , I swear to God I 'll blow your head off .
WAYNE: Got it .
MICKEY: You ! What 's your name ?
MALLORY: DuncanHomolka ?
WAYNE: My name is Wayne Gayle ! I am the sta of 'American Maniacs ' , watched by forty million people every week ! I am a espected journalist , winners of the Golden Globe , the Edward R. Murrows Award among others ! If anybody puts me in danger , my network will sue The Los Angeles County Sheriffs Department . My estate will sue every officer personally who fires . The network 's law firm is Rowlands , Davis and Sinclair
MALLORY: Make a path ! The wall of deputies starts moving backward .
WURLITZER: How far do you think your gon na get ?
MICKEY: Right out the front door .
WURLITZER: That 'll never happen .
MICKEY: It is happening .
MALLORY: Do n't stop ! Wayne starts up again .
WURLITZER: I will personally hunt you down , blow the head off your fucking-whore-wife , and plant your sick ass in the ground all by myself .
MICKEY: Another day perhaps , but not today . Mickey leaves FRAME .
WAYNE: This is Wayne Gayle . I 'm wounded and my crew , Roger and Scott , are dead . This may be out of sync 'cause we are shooting with a wild camera and a standard recorder we found in the van . Mickey Knox 's plan worked . We walked out the front door , into my news van and made our getaway . When we were followed by patrol cars , Mallory Knox killed Deputy Sheriff Duncan Homolka and tossed his body out of the back . Mickey told authorities over my police and that I would surely be next if they did n't give up the pursuit . They took Mickey at his word and called off the pursuit . Why helicopters were n't employed , I do n't know . My only thought is it all happened too fast fo arrangements to be made . We 've just pulled off to the side of the road to do this interview . Tensions run high Mickey screams O.S .
MALLORY: It was n't 'till we got on the ground floor that I totally realized they were n't gon na shoot unless we shot first . When we got out of the stairwell , I remember thinking , 'Oh my God . This might work . ' But Mickey knew it would work all along . There was n't any doubt in his mind . It 's not like there was and he just did n't show it . He knew it would work .
MICKEY: Divine intervention .
MALLORY: What he said . We did n't know jack shit about and riot . It just happened . It was kismet . We did n't even know those people . How are we supposed to organize a riot when we 've been in fuckin ' isolation for the past year ? Just bleep out the fucks and jack shits . I mean , it 's not like we care . If they wan na say we masterminded the whole thing , let 'em . It wo n't exactly keep us up at night . But you said you wanted the truth , and the truth is we were just lucky . Mickey 's snapping his fingers in the B.G .
MICKEY: C'mon , c'mon , let 's hurry this up .
MALLORY: Well , now me and Mickey are gon na take it easy . Just enjoy each other 's company , stop and smell the roses , notice the color purple , stuff like that .
MICKEY: Okay , that 's enough . End of interview . We got ta move .
WAYNE: That 's a joke right ?
MICKEY: I said I 'd give you a interview . Now unless I 'm mistaken , we just did a interview . We did an interview , did n't we ?
MALLORY: Looked like an interview to me .
MICKEY: I said we 'd give you an interview . I never said we would n't kill you .
WAYNE: Wait ! I do n't know , but I kinda felt during thisthis whole escape that a kind of bond Wayne is shaking .
MICKEY: No . Not really .
WAYNE: Do n't touch those triggers ! Please . I think I 've already proven that a live Wayne Gayle is much more better that a deadWay Gayle . I was you passport out of jail , not Duncan Homolka . But me ! I 'll be you passport outta-
MICKEY: Just save your breath , Wayne . We hate you . If anybody in the fuckin ' world deserves to die , it 's you . Wayne is grasping for anything .
WAYNE: Wait ! You ca n't kill me . Mickey and Mallory always leave somebody alive to tell the tale .
MICKEY: We are . Your camera . Mickey turns to Mallory .
WAYNE: NO ! ! !
PARKER: Why the young executive look ?
DREW: I have my interview at NYU today .
PARKER: And she never will . At least until after I 'm married .
DREW: Did n't it hurt ?
PARKER: Like hell . Drew shivers .
DREW: Piercings are so unhygienic .
DREW: Breakfast .
PARKER: Hellooo , Warren .
DREW: Morning , Dad .
CHARLEY: Morning , baby .
DREW: How 's the book coming ?
CHARLEY: Well , sweety , my writing process is a lot like a giant hydroelectric dam . For a long time I just let the great ideas uild up and build up until the sheer weight of them spills ove and the words just come pouring out .
DREW: Still stuck , huh ?
CHARLEY: Not a word .
DREW: Another one for the trophy room , huh ?
PARKER: Boys can be fun . You should try one some time .
QUINN: You ready for your interview ?
DREW: I 've prepared a color-coded itinerary based on dividing the day into fifteen minute increments alternating blue/red , double- checked the train schedule , confirmed with the Weather Channel and rehearsed a couple of alternate scenarios last night , you know , just to account for all the possible glitches .
PARKER: We 'll take that as a yes .
CHARLEY: I 'm proud of you for sticking to your plan all these years , sweety .
PARKER: I still do n't understand why you want to finish college in two years ? What 's the big hurry ?
DREW: I want to hit the ground running . All those football games and the partying and the whole dating scene . It just seems like a lot of wasted time that could be spent more productively .
QUINN: The Accelerated program would look great on your med school application .
PARKER: Football games I get . But partying ? A waste of time ? Parker looks to her dad . He shrugs .
CHARLEY: To each her own .
QUINN: Well , Drew . I have a surprise .
DREW: What ? !
QUINN: Is n't that great ! We can do some shopping , have lunch , real girl stuff . Wo n't that be fun ?
PARKER: If you want to have fun , I 'm the one who should go , not Mothe Teresa over there . Drew is still choking pretty badly .
QUINN: You okay ?
DREW: No I mean , it 's impossible . I 've got every minute accounted for right up to the interview . Blue and red ! It wo n't work .
QUINN: I just thought you know I 've een working and we have n't had a chance to spend much time together
QUINN: and both my babies are going away to college next Fall .
PARKER: Do n't be sad , Mom . Just think , when Drew leaves for school , you wo n't be losing a daughter , you 'll e losing an anal-retentive social misfit who will be voted most likely to die a virgin .
DREW: I 'm sorry , Mom . It 's really sweet of you . But do n't worry . Parke will be living here with you forever since no college on earth will ever take her .
QUINN: Stop it , you two . Mom blows her nose .
PARKER: It 's not fair you guys get to go into the City and I do n't .
CHARLEY: Do n't you have a chem test , young lady ?
PARKER: Chemistry ? Please . Name one time you ever used chemistry in you life .
CHARLEY: Good point .
QUINN: I use chemistry every day .
PARKER: You 're a doctor , Mom . I 'm not going to be a doctor . I ca n't even say the word 'orifice , ' let alone put a finger up one .
DREW: Time to go .
QUINN: Doctor MacLeod I 'm sorry , but my itinerary is ooked solid today . Call Dr. Wessels . He 's covering for me . He did ? Are you sure it 's the baby 's head ? All right . I 'm coming .
DREW: Ah , darn it , Mom . That 's a shame . It 's like fate is conspiring against us .
QUINN: I know .
DREW: You absolutely , positively have to promise me we 'll do it anothe time .
QUINN: I promise . I better hurry . Have Parker drop you at the train station on her way to school , will you ? Quinn gives her daughter a smile and a kiss .
QUINN: Kill 'em in that interview .
DREW: Mom , you know , I might not get in .
QUINN: Are you kidding me ? You 're Drew MacLeod . Nobody 's smarter , nobody works harder and nobody , and I mean nobody , is ever more prepared .
DREW: Hey ! Stop ! Drew takes off running after the car !
PARKER: Good luck with your interview . Drew pauses , holding the door open .
DREW: You know , Parker . Chemistry is important . When you think about it , everything 's made of chemicals .
PARKER: Oh , I 'm interested in chemistry . Just not the kind with all the numbers and stinky test tubes .
DREW: Professor Spaulding . Good afternoon . I 'm Drew MacLeod .
PARKER: Looking for a seat .
DREW: This ca n't be happening . Wait , I know . This is one of those Ground Hog Day dreams , is n't it ? Drew pinches herself too hard .
PARKER: You know , I just got this itch .
DREW: Then scratch it and get back to school .
PARKER: I could n't concentrate anyway . I 'm too distracted today .
DREW: You 're permanently distracted . It 's called Attention Deficit Disorder . Is this about that chat room guy ? It is , is n't it ?
PARKER: No ! It 's about spontaneity , which you obviously would n't know anything about .
DREW: I swear to God , Parker , you go through boyfriends like Junio Mints . It 's pathetic .
PARKER: Pathetic ? You want to talk about pathetic ? ! At least I do n't count getting accidentally felt up in dodge ball as my first date !
DREW: Is this any of your business ? He goes back to his paper .
EXECUTIVE: Would you like this seat so you two can fight ?
DREW: I have to mentally preview my day now . I ca n't talk anymore . Parker turns to go , then remembers something .
PARKER: Uh , Drew ? Do you have any money ? I do n't have enough for a ticket .
CONDUCTOR: Ticket , please .
PARKER: Why do n't I save the b.s . story and just ask you to cut me a break this one time because I know you 've got a big heart and you emember what it was like when you were young and and randy ?
CONDUCTOR: Very funny .
DREW: Excuse me ?
CONDUCTOR: Let 's go . He takes her by the arm .
DREW: What are you doing ?
CONDUCTOR: I tried to be nice about it , but if you want the police involved , this is the way to do it .
DREW: Police ? I did n't do anything .
CONDUCTOR: No ticket , no train ride .
DREW: No ! That 's not me ! That was my twin sister you threw off !
CONDUCTOR: Young lady , in thirty years I have heard every possible line but that 's the lamest ever .
DREW: She 's right there !
DREAM GUY: You okay ?
DREW: I 'm ouch .
CONDUCTOR: She 's fine , considering she should e in jail .

PARKER: You get kicked off , too ? Why did n't you just buy a ticket ?
DREW: Do n't .
PARKER: What happened to your head ?
DREW: Oh , just a minor concussion I sustained while the Conductor was throwing me off the train because he thought I was you sneaking back on the train !
PARKER: Sorry .
DREW: I 'll bet .
PARKER: I am ! Where are you going ?

PARKER: Barneys .
DREW: Not Barneys .
PARKER: We 've got five hours . Relax . He FIRES UP the LINCOLN and off they go .
DREW: This was supposed to be someone else 's car , was n't it ?

PARKER: Come on ! We 're going to the Plaza ! We can be Eloise ! We 'll get a nice room , you can take a shower and I 'll swap clothes with you ! Simple as that !

PARKER: That 's not important now . But let 's just say that it 's a good thing for you I think those shoes are so ugly I never borrowed them . Hey , how about there ?
DREW: No . I want to get clean , not contract hepatitis .
PARKER: Twenty-six dollars and thirty-six cents .
DREW: We touch nothing . Parker leads them inside .
PARKER: Hello ? Anybody ?
PARKER: We need a room with a shower . Just for an hour .
DESK CLERK: Sixty bucks .
PARKER: Hi .
DESK CLERK: You want the room or not ?
DREW: Sixty dollars an hour for this
PARKER: really nice place . How much for half an hour .
DESK CLERK: Maybe if you two were in school you could figure out that half a sixty is thirty .
PARKER: We 've only got twenty-five .
DESK CLERK: You think because I 'm short you can just charm me into making some deal , is that it ?
PARKER: No , not at all .
DREW: It 's all we have . Twenty-six dollars and thirty-six cents .
DESK CLERK: Are you the one that stinks so ad ?
DREW: I had a little accident , okay ?
DESK CLERK: All right , all right , do n't get your underwear in a bunch . As a public service , just 'cause you stink so bad , you can have it fo twenty-five .
DREW: What part of 'That is all the money we have ' did n't make sense to you ?
PARKER: Sir , that 's every last cent we have in the world . I swear to you , we are n't planning to steal your key .
DESK CLERK: I give you some special deal , the next thing you know , you two are telling everybody , hey , this midget was a real sap . We gave him some sob story and the little guy just busted up into crocodile tears and handed over the key .
PARKER: I promise we wo n't tell anyone . Will we , Drew ?
DREW: Not a word . Girl Scout 's honor .
PARKER: Drew ? ! DREW ? ! Parker follows her .
DESK CLERK: Come back with my key !
PARKER: Drew ! STOP !
QUINN: Mrs. Greenspan ? You 're going to have to help . I need you to push .
MRS. GREENSPAN: Did you see that ?
MR. GREENSPAN: Honey ? The baby ? Please ?
NYPD OFFICER: All right . Who 's the wise guy ?
PARKER: Man , that little guy could really motor . Why 'd you bolt ?
DREW: There was a rat , Parker . A rat the size of a Doberman eating my foot .
PARKER: That was all our money .
DREW: Our money ? OUR MONEY ? !
PARKER: Key down , you 're going to have an attack .
DREW: Parker , it was not 'our ' money and this is not 'our ' day in New York . What it is , is quite possibly the most important day of my life . I 've resigned myself to the fact that you do n't give a crap about what you do with yours , but if you could find it in your heart , you tiny , cold steel heart , to respect what this means to me , I would appreciate it .
PARKER: You know how I told you not to be paranoid ?
DREW: Paranoid ?
PARKER: What I meant was , it is n't paranoia if someone really is chasing you .
DREW: What 's wrong with your eyes ?
PARKER: It 's him .
PARKER: Quiet . Do n't run . He 'll see us .
DREW: HE SAW US ! The girls break into a run .
PARKER: Maybe it 's just coincidence !
DREW: Or maybe WE TOLD HIM WHERE WE WERE
PARKER: Come on !
DREW: I do n't want to do this anymore . I want to be done . No more rats , no more mob hit men .
PARKER: Well , Cinderella , your wish has come true . Voila , La Plaza , mademoiselle .
DREW: So ? Hello ? No dinero ?
PARKER: Yeah . I 've got what I 'd like to call a 'creative solution ' to that .
DREW: No . I 'm calling Mom .
PARKER: What good will that do ?
DREW: I 'll have her uh
PARKER: Have her what ? Hi , Mom ? Could you leave that baby halfway outta there and drive into the city ?
DREW: Dad , then .
PARKER: Dad , hey . Drew . Complete loser . Could n't get to an interview by myself , need full bail out . Yeah . I 'm the one who was going to change the world , I just could n't get across town .
DREW: Damn it , Parker , my itinerary is shot to hell ! Blue , red Her WATCH ALARM BEEPS .
PARKER: When you ask a question like that , the person is going to look .
DREW: I think he was .
PARKER: Drew , we have n't done anything .
DREW: Yeah , but I 'm standing in the lobby of the Plaza looking like a deranged street person who might attack at any moment . In fact , I might attack at any moment . The ELEVATOR behind them opens .
PARKER: Let 's go .
DREW: What are we doing ? And why am I whispering ?
PARKER: We 're getting you a shower . Blake Greer pulled this at the Sheraton after the prom .
DREW: Great . Now we 're emulating Blake Greer , voted most likely to commit a felony before having to shave .
PARKER: We 're not going to steal anything . We 're just going to sneak in , use a little soap and water and get out .
DREW: Oh , we 're not going to steal anything . Super . Just a little 'breaking and entering . '
PARKER: We 're not going to break anything . We are going to enter , however .
DREW: No . No . No .
PARKER: Shhh here comes somebody .
PARKER: Hurry up !
DREW: No !
PARKER: I did n't want to have to do this , ut look in the mirror behind you . ON DREW bracing herself , she turns slowly .
DREW: I ca n't do this .
PARKER: Drew , you 're not a criminal . You just smell like one . This way .
DREW: Oh , no . Oh my god . A a What the hell is it ?
PARKER: A dog ?
DREW: I 'm itching already . See ? Are my arms red ?
PARKER: Key down . I 'll take him in the living room and keep a lookout . You just get in that shower . Parker approaches The Emperor .
PARKER'S POV: The hallway 's empty .
PARKER: Come back here , little ratdog . Come to Mommy Parker .
ROGER: Thank you . Bye bye . No .
PARKER: That 's not your dog ! Hey !
DREW: There 's a man in there !
PARKER: Somebody took the dog !

MORTY: Just call the damn police and patch me through . The Emperor 's een kidnapped .
DREW: I ca n't do it !
PARKER: Yes you can !
DREW: No I ca n't !
PARKER: Have fun in prison . Under 'Summe Internships ' on your college application , you can write 'license plate manufacturing . '
DREW: I did it .
PARKER: Get out of there !
MORTY: Stop ! Bring back that dog !
DREW: He thinks we have the dog !

HAIRSTYLIST: Perfection .
DREW: Why does this not surprise me ?
SHOWRUNNER: That 's rich . A model going to college . What next ? Talking monkeys ?
PARKER: The hotel guy 's here .
DREW: Everybody washed their hands , ight ?
HOGAN: I guess that explains why he 's a security guard .
DREW: Perfect .
PARKER: Is this what they call 'returning to the scene of the crime ' ?
PLAZA MANAGER: I assure you , Mr. and Mrs . Lo Biancho , The Plaza will do everything in its power to see that The Emperor is safely eturned and that the criminals are brought to justice .
MORTY: Bruce ! 10-80 at the wagon wheel !
DREW: Park
MORTY: Damn it !
BRUCE: Where 'd they go ?
HOGAN: They could n't have gone very far . We 'll split up . You go that way ! You take Fifth ! Come on , get on your horse !
WILLIAMSON: Coffee ?
HOGAN: Sure .
WILLIAMSON: Two black .
HOGAN: Where do you think those two went ?
WILLIAMSON: Beats me . They did n't have any stupid dog with them from what I could see .
HOGAN: Might have stashed it .
WILLIAMSON: Maybe they ate it . The cops giggle at this .
HOGAN: Hey , Speedy . You did n't see a couple of blondes run past here , did you ?
SPEEDY: Yep . Could n't miss 'em . Real criminal types . Looked like they were headed to Mexico .
HOGAN: That 's where they all go .
WILLIAMSON: See you around .
SPEEDY: Not if I see you first . The cops head back to The Plaza .
HOGAN: I say we put Abbott and Costello on the ransom watch . I do n't want to be stuck in the same room all day with Leona Helmsley 's nasty stepsister .
SPEEDY: Whew . You know , it 's not some old wives ' tale about blind people having an acute sense of smell .
DREW: Sorry .
SPEEDY: So ? What did you do with that dog ?
DREW: We did n't steal it , I swear .
PARKER: A painter did .
SPEEDY: You girls best give yourselves up and tell 'em the story .
DREW: He 's right , Parker .
PARKER: Of course he 's right . We 're going to march in there and give ourselves up right this minute . They will , of course , take us down to the precinct , call Mom and Dad , we 'll give our statement , they 'll grill us under hot lights for a few hours , force us to confess with some tricky good cop/bad cop outine and the next thing you know we 're doing five to ten in Attica . Drew checks her watch .
DREW: So we 'll turn ourselves in right after the interview .
SPEEDY: May I make one suggestion ?
PARKER: Sure .
SPEEDY: Hit the showers before you do anything else .
DREW: We 're facing felony charges , Parker . Maybe you can do your on- line flirting later . Better yet , he can see you during visitor 's hours . Parker reads the incoming MESSAGE from
PARKER: Oh my God . Warren works in the city .
DREW: Warren ? WARREN ? ! So you lied , ight to my face . No , Drew , this is n't about the chat room guy . Nah !
SPEEDY: Take your daughters to work day . The guy pays for his paper , leaves .
DREW: Are you listening to me ? ! Give me that stupid thing ! Drew reaches for the Blackberry .
PARKER: Knock it off , Drew ! This guy might be able to help . He lives here .
DREW: Parker , you have completely lost your mind if you can be thinking about boys at a time like this !
PARKER: The United Nations ?
DREW: You ca n't possibly know somebody who works at the United Nations . Maybe he meant United Su Sandwiches . Or United Skate Rats Store .
PARKER: So . We 're going to the United Nations to use the restroom .
DREW: How convenient . You arrange a little date while your sister 's future hangs in the balance .
PARKER: Look , he said he 'd help and it 's only a couple blocks away . You got a better idea ? Speedy opens the rear door of the newsstand .
SPEEDY: Coast 's clear .
PARKER: Thank you , Mr . Speedy .
SPEEDY: You 're quite welcome . Good luck in that interview .
CHARLEY: Wal-Mart ? Hey , Marvin . You bet . Typing away .
CHARLEY: Got it . See you in the City .
CATERER: Rumaki , ma'am .
BABS: Andrea , Andrea . How dreadful ! I shudder to think how the poo Emperor may be suffering .
BRUCE: Do you know how to turn this on ?
PARKER: We 're going to make it , Drew . You 'll see . There 's still plenty of time . You 'll get cleaned up , we can trade clothes this is a nice suit , huh ? Right ?
DREW: Yes .
PARKER: You 're going to get accepted , then we can explain the misunderstanding about the dog to the police and everything will be okay .
DREW: Maybe after the police forgive us for sneaking into someone else 's hotel room , we can ask them to please keep the mob hit man from whacking us and dropping us into the marina so he does n't get his suit dirty .
PARKER: First things first .
DREW: Parker , I know you 're trying to cheer me up , but I have to be honest . This is all your fault .
PARKER: My fault ? MY FAULT ? ! I did n't mean for any of this to happen !
DREW: Yeah , right ! Like you did n't mean to ask Bernie Lipscomb to the prom !
PARKER: What 's that supposed to mean ?
DREW: I 'll bet that was just anothe accident of yours that happened to screw up my life !
PARKER: Bernie Lipscomb ? You ?
DREW: You know I did !
PARKER: No I did n't . I have n't seen you talk to a guy since we were in kindergarten and we thought Jerry Wester was a girl .
DREW: You asked Bernie just to snake him from me !
PARKER: I did not ! Wow , the really spooky thing is , that would mean we liked the same guy .
POLICEMAN: Is n't that those two right there ?
POLICEMAN #2: I 'll be damned . But when they look up
POLICEMAN: Where the hell did they go ?
POLICEMAN #2: 605 to Base . We spotted the dognapping suspects , corner of 1st and 49th .
HOGAN: 605 , do you still have visual ?
WILLIAMSON: That 's over by the U.N .
HOGAN: See if you can pick them up . We 're on our way . Zoom ! Williamson blasts crosstown .
WILLIAMSON: There they are .
DETECTIVES' POV: just a glimpse as they ENTER the building .
HOGAN: What in the world could they be doing here ?
DREW: Do you see him ?
PARKER: No .
TOUR GUIDE: I ca n't tell you how much I 've looked forward to this .
BRUNETTE: Momma ?
TOUR GUIDE: Sorry . My mistake .
DREW: Oh , shit . What now ?
PARKER: Warren ? Does anyone know Warren Collier ?
WARREN: Parker ? Warren moves back to Drew and Parker .
PARKER: Gee , Warren . Is n't that strange ? I did n't recognize you from you picture .
WARREN: Yeah , I , uh
DREW: We do n't have time for this now .
PARKER: Do you have an office or someplace private we could go ?
WARREN: I just have to do this tour and
DREW: We 'll get back to that .
WARREN: What 's going on ?
PARKER: It 's important .
WARREN: Okay . Let me get somebody to cover for me .
WARREN: Hey , Angie , take the 11 00 for me , will you ?
DREW: Angie ? Take the 11 00 .
ANGIE: You owe me , Warren .
PARKER: Are you a lying sack , or what ?
WARREN: What was I supposed to do ? I liked you . If I 'd sent a real picture , would you have met me ?
PARKER: That 's not the point .
WARREN: That means no . At least this way I got to see you before you blow me off .
DREW: No one is blowing you off , Warren . As a matter of fact , we 're very happy to see you , are n't we , Parker ?
PARKER: I guess .
DREW: And we 're grateful for your help .
PARKER: This is my sister , Drew .
WARREN: Not-a-twin , huh ?
PARKER: That 's a joke .
WARREN: Yeah , well . I guess everybody would like the world to see them a little bit differently than they are .
DREW: Super . Now that that 's all settled , is there a restroom I can get to without going out there ?
WARREN: What 's wrong with going out there ?
PARKER: Police , for one thing .
WARREN: Police ? I thought you guys were joking .
PARKER: It 's the kind of joke that will be a lot funnier a few years from now .
WARREN: Well that door 's the only way out . There 's a restroom at the end of the main hall . Parker opens the office door , peeking out .
DREW: They there ?
PARKER: I do n't see 'em .
DREW: They must be searching the uilding .
WARREN: What 'd you guys do , anyway ? Mug a couple supermodels ?
DREW: Let 's go .
WARREN: This way !
DREW: Are you okay ?
CANADIAN REPRESENTATIVE: Ohhh I 'm so sick . The mussels at lunch . You have to help me .
DREW: I 'm kind of in my own private hell ight now .
CANADIAN REPRESENTATIVE: What 's your name ?
DREW: Drew .
CANADIAN REPRESENTATIVE: Drew it 's vitally important .
DREW: Uh , Canada ? It 's sort of far away .
CANADIAN REPRESENTATIVE: In the Assembly . Give the file to Mr. Wakefield , the Canadian epresentative .
DREW: You want me to take this to the Canadian Representative to the United Nations ?
CANADIAN REPRESENTATIVE: Hurry ! This is a crisis ! What can she possibly do ?
DREW: Okay . Drew EXITS the stall and goes to the door .
CANADIAN REPRESENTATIVE: To the left . Run !
WARREN: He 's gone .
PARKER: Thank you . Maybe we should get out of this sack .
CHINESE REP: Impossible ! This would be globally destabilizing !
BULGARIAN REP: Hah ! Posturing and rhetoric !
DREW: Sir ?
CHINESE REP: This crisis falls at the feet of one nation and one nation only !
CHINESE REP: How do you defend such a position ! The world is waiting to hear !
DREW: Well , I 'm not certain This furrows some brows .
NORTH KOREA: Is she new ?
NORWAY: Beats me .
NORTH KOREA: She 's hot .
NORWAY: Weird hairdo .
CHINESE REP: That is absurd !
DREW: Absurd ? !
DREW: Not so absurd , since I have the documents right here in my possession !
PARKER: How are we going to find Drew ?
WARREN: Something tells me that wo n't be too tough .
DREW: And besides , who said absurd is necessarily bad ? Sometimes absurd is good ! For instance , absurd can e sort of funny ! In conclusion , I propose that all of you should talk amongst yourselves . Thank you .
KOFI ANAN: Canada has proposed furthe debate .
U.S. REP: The United States of America seconds the motion !
WARREN: Jin zshe miya BRAD PITT !
PARKER: You speak Japanese ?
WARREN: I may not look like an underwea model , but I 'm smarter than a hundred of them put together . Warren grabs a Taxi door .
PARKER: We do n't have any money !
WARREN: I 'm smart AND rich !
PARKER: Follow that uh
DREW: They 're following US , Parker !
PARKER: Oh , yeah . JUST GO ! The TAXI pulls away from the curb .
WILLIAMSON: Maybe we should give them a little leash and see what they do with it .
HOGAN: Fine . But we 're gon na have to stop for lunch pretty soon , 'cause I 'm getting heartburn . They pull into traffic , following the Cab . In a BEAT , Bennie 's Town Car follows , too .
PARKER: Excuse me , what were you doing ?
DREW: Someone was sick in the bathroom and they asked me to hold on , I do n't owe you any explanation .
PARKER: You 're the one all ' I got ta get to this interview or I 'm gon na have a nervous breakdown ' and yet you have time to address the United Nations ?
WARREN: You know , technically , you have to have security clearance to ente the Assembly .
PARKER: Not now , Warren .
DREW: You have a lot of nerve , Parker . It was you that got me tossed off the train ! You had to give the um that dollar ! You get the suit , I get the leather bikini !
WARREN: Which is n't so bad .
DREW: And you got Bernie Lipscomb while I got Scrabble with Mom and Dad !
WARREN: Who 's Bernie Lipscomb ?
PARKER: I told you , I did n't know you liked him ! It was no big deal !
DREW: It was to me !
PARKER: How could I know ? You never tell me anything !
DREW: There 's a good reason for that !
PARKER: What 's that supposed to mean ?
DREW: You know very well what it means , Ms. Big Mouth !
PARKER: Big mouth ? ! Ooh , I hope you miss that stupid interview !
DREW: Oh yeah ? Well , the joke 's on you , ecause there is n't any interview !
PARKER: What ?
DREW: No interview . I screwed up .
PARKER: You screwed up what ?
DREW: Scheduling the interview . You deaf ?
PARKER: You 're Drew . Drew does n't screw ANYTHING up , let alone scheduling . You 're the Iron Chef of scheduling .
DREW: I missed the deadline .
PARKER: How ?
DREW: After they made the first cut from the preliminary application , we were supposed to send in a form to secure our interview time and I filled it out and had everything eady to go in the mailbox and then Drew is near tears .
PARKER: And then what ? Earthquake ? Tsunami ? Nuclear winter ?
DREW: I forgot .
PARKER: Forgot ?
DREW: Yes . I just forgot . When I found it in my bag a week later , I 'd missed the deadline .
PARKER: So today ? All this ? What are you doing ?
DREW: I I was going to try to meet Professor Spaulding and
PARKER: You were just going to jump him ?
WARREN: Sort of a guerilla interview ? You know , I 'm a big Michael Moore fan
DREW: I called and the secretary said there were no exceptions to the deadline so I was going to try to see him when he finished the othe interviews . I knew it was hopeless , but I was so embarrassed . Drew wipes her tears , then
PARKER: Drew ? ! Drew , get back in this taxi !
WARREN: She 's pretty upset .
PARKER: Gee , you really are a genius .
DREW: Darn it ! DARN IT DARN IT DARN IT !
WILLIAMSON: Did one of them just get out ?
HOGAN: I think so . Maybe she 's going fo the dog .
WILLIAMSON: Maybe that 's what they want us to think .
HOGAN: So we stay with the taxi ?
WILLIAMSON: Unless you want to hoof it afte the other one .
HOGAN: We stay with the taxi .
ROGER: Get in the back , will ya ?
ROGER: If you want to see your dog alive again , listen closely . I want a hundred thousand dollars transferred into this numbered Swiss account
ROGER: Well , Mr . Fancy Pants . You can wipe that stupid smile off you face . I do n't think they love you as much as you think they do .
PARKER: Where 'd she go ?
WARREN: I think she took a right up there .
PARKER: Follow my sister .
TAXI DRIVER: I thought we were the ones being followed .
PARKER: Stay flexible , will you please ? They turn right .
ROGER: Okay . Here 's how we make the
ROGER: Okay .
DREW: I just want you to know that I 'm allergic to you AND cynophobic ! She and Roger race right past
DREW: I ca n't stop ! I have to return this dog !
ROGER: I 'll be right back !
WARREN: Uh , is n't that your sister ?
PARKER: It ca n't be . She 's terrified of dogs .
HOGAN: I 'm telling you , I got a hunch these girls do n't have anything to do with this dog .
DREW: Officer ? ! Officer ? !
DREW: Where 's the Policeman ?
ACTION: CHAOS .
WILLIAMSON: NYPD ! Move aside !
WARREN: You think she made it ?
PARKER: She 's faster than she looks .
MORTY: Is n't that The Emperor , ma'am ?
DREW: Please ! I 'll get hives ! Oh , go ahead .
DREW'S POV: The Detectives appear above her .
DREW: I , uh , just wanted to return him .
WILLIAMSON: We 'll sort it out .
DREW: But I have this interview . I mean , it 's not really an interview . I 'd never lie to the police never mind .
WARREN: What now ?
PARKER: We have to go to the jail and tell them what happened .
WARREN: What on earth did happen ?
PARKER: Poor Drew . She wanted to get into that program more than anything in the world .
BENNIE: You goin ' somewhere ? She 's paralyzed with fear .
WARREN: Hello , sir .
PARKER: Oh my God ! Please do n't kill me !
WARREN: Kill ?
PARKER: We do n't know anything at all ! We did n't see anything or hea anything and I 'll swear to that in a court of law !
BENNIE: What 's the big idea ? You two a couple a nutbags or somethin ' ? She opens one eye .
PARKER: Nut bags ? No . I mean , yes . Is there a right answer to that ? See , my sister had this interview which turned out not to be an interview , really and I sort of messed things up because I wanted to meet him . Indicating Warren .
WARREN: Really ? You came into town just for me ? Wow .
PARKER: Not now , Warren . Drew was going to be late even though technically she was n't going to be late since there was n't an interview and that 's when we got in your car . I promise we meant to pay . It was a true emergency .
BENNIE: I meant , why you runnin ' when I 'm trying to give you your bag back ?
PARKER: You were just ?
BENNIE: I found your mom 's number in the ook . She said you needed it pretty badly for that big interview . Listen , I got ta go . It 's my mother-in-law 's birthday and I got ta plant some stupid rose ush and then take her out to dinner at the Pier . See ya around .
PARKER: Thank you ?
WARREN: Well , he certainly is a good Samaritan . Parker looks at the daybag .
PARKER: What time is it ?
DREW: Thank you .
RED: Is it Bobo ?
DREW: Yes , as a matter-of-fact , it is .
RED: He 's a genius .
PARKER: Try to keep up , Warren !
WARREN: Hey ! I 'm an intellectual ! I never claimed to be athletic !
RED: Do you mind ? I 'm a fanatic fo Jimmy Choo .
DREW: It 's all yours .
HOGAN: You 're free to go .
DREW: No thanks . I 'll just stay here with the girls .
HOGAN: An eyewitness says he saw who took the dog . Did n't realize the guy was stealing it until he saw us grab you .
HOGAN: There 's your alibi .
DREW: I do n't even know him .
HOGAN: That 's what he said . Go home . Get cleaned up , a good night 's sleep . None of this will seem so ad in the morning .
BIKE GUY: You okay ?
DREW: Thanks , Jim . How 'd you know ?
JIM: Wait . Where are you going ?
DREW: Thanks for getting me out of jail ut I have to go home now because my entire life is ruined .
JIM: Bad day , huh ?
DREW: You turn understatement into an art .
JIM: Can you just tell me your name ? Please ?
DREW: I 'm Drew MacLeod . The girl who wo n't be going to the NYU Accelerated Program .
JIM: Why not ? Drew looks at her watch .
DREW: Because short of flying , there 's no way to get from here to NYU in five minutes .
JIM: Sure there is .
WARREN: Wow . And I thought I was anal .
PARKER: This is no good . I do n't do too well with the whole rehearsal thing . I 'm more of a 'wing it ' person .
PARKER: How 's this look ? Drewish ?
WARREN: You know , I 've always had a thing for librarians .
PARKER: Warren , honesty is fine . But you could edit a little , you know ?
WARREN: Got it .
PARKER: Wish me luck .
WARREN: Good luck , Drew .
SECRETARY: May I help you ?
PARKER: I 'm here to see Professo Spaulding .
SECRETARY: You do n't have an appointment .
PARKER: Um , no . However
PARKER: Professor Spaulding ?
PROFESSOR SPAULDING: Yes ?
PARKER: May I have a moment of your time ?
PROFESSOR SPAULDING: I 'm sorry , but I have a plane to catch .
PARKER: I know . But this is very important .
PROFESSOR SPAULDING: What is this about ?
PARKER: Life and death , if you must know .
PROFESSOR SPAULDING: Ms. MacLeod , I hope this is interesting .
PARKER: Trust me .
JIM: You okay ?
DREW: Fine . and up the stairs then stops , turns .
JIM: I 'll be right here .
DREW: Great . She launches herself into the building .
PARKER: I promise you , though my missing the deadline seems to suggest otherwise , my studies would neve suffer on account of my being unorganized . This was , and I think anyone who knows me would vouch for this , a complete anomaly .
PROFESSOR SPAULDING: Ms. MacLeod , I recall you application being one of the strongest we received . Not seeing your name on the interview list surprised me . I assumed , of course , that you 'd changed you mind .
PARKER: No . Not at all . This program is my number one priority .
PROFESSOR SPAULDING: Yes , well , I 'm sure you can appreciate that with so many applicants for so few spaces there must be rules to govern the selection process .
DREW: Professor Spaulding ? I ca n't apologize enough for barging in like this .
PROFESSOR SPAULDING: No . Please . It looks like I 'm taking the red-eye now anyway .
DREW: Parker ?
PARKER: Hi , Parker .
DREW: What are you doing ?
PARKER: Oh , the Professor and I have had a wonderful talk about how important this program is to me and how it was my sister , Drew , who screwed things up .
PROFESSOR SPAULDING: I 'm having a little trouble following this .
DREW: You were being me ?
PROFESSOR SPAULDING: Would you like to sit down ?
PARKER: When I saw them take you to jail
PROFESSOR SPAULDING: Jail ?
PARKER: I did n't think you 'd make it . I knew I would n't be any good at it , but I figured at least there was a chance .
DREW: That 's sweet .
PARKER: You 're not mad ?
DREW: No .
PARKER: I 'm so sorry for today .
DREW: It 's okay . But let 's talk about it later .
PROFESSOR SPAULDING: Please . Go right ahead .
PARKER: Thank you .
DREW: Parker , consider , just for a moment , whether this is the appropriate time and place .
PARKER: Okay , I considered . What I want to say is , I did n't purposefully set out to ruin your day , but that does n't mean I 'm not a little jealous .
DREW: Jealous ?
PARKER: I 'm not like you . I do n't have your intensity , your focus , your
PROFESSOR SPAULDING: Fashion sense ?
PARKER: I just mean , maybe , even if I do n't intend to , maybe that jealousy , you know , gets in the way sometimes .
DREW: You mean subliminally you 're undermining me ?
PARKER: I do n't know if I 'd get that technical about it . But yeah .
DREW: Well , thank you for saying that .
PARKER: You 're welcome . Are n't you going to confess now ?
DREW: Confess what ?
PROFESSOR SPAULDING: There 's got to be something . Like how you lost your shoes ?
PARKER: How you 're secretly jealous of me ?
DREW: Why would I be jealous of you ?
PARKER: Oh , let me see . Because I do n't have a stick up my butt ? Because I know how to have fun ? Because I 'm spontaneous and creative and men are all my love slaves ? Drew stops , ponders this deeply .
DREW: Nope . Then she smiles , only a teensy bit .
PROFESSOR SPAULDING: Are you certain ?
DREW: I wanted more than anything in the world to be a part of you program . I still do . But I failed . I did n't follow the ules . And honestly , before today , I did n't know how I was going to live with that . How to live with failure . I 'm not good at it . I have n't done it much . But today I realized that I 've lived in fear of it too long .
DREW: and lighten up .
PROFESSOR SPAULDING: It was worth it , I assure you . Now , could you clear up one thing for me ?
DREW: Thanks . The sisters hug , but we GO
PARKER: Sis ?
DREW: Yeah ?
PARKER: Got ta go .

DREW: First I want to take a shower . For about a week .
JIM: You have a card ? Are n't you in high school ?
PARKER: Oh , man . I 'm doomed . I 'll neve get home before them .
WARREN: Sure you will .
PARKER: Warren , something tells me you 're spoiled !
WARREN: Yes ! But in a good way !
QUINN: Girls ? Quinn steps in , grimfaced .
PARKER: We , uh , do n't think you 're naive , Mom .
DREW: No . Honestly , it was all an accident .
QUINN: I know what this is .
DREW: It was spontaneous .
QUINN: Yeah . Obviously . Oh , by the way
PARKER: So ? Open it . There 's a HONK .
PARKER: Come on !
DREW: It does n't really matter one way or the other . Maybe I should n't e in such a hurry . Why do n't we go out and have some fun . Besides , if this is n't good news , I do n't want it to ruin our night . Parker and Quinn simply continue to stare .
CHARLEY: So , how 'd you two meet the girls ?

BUNSEN: We 'll get a new headline writer , Mr. Pulitzer .
PULITZER: Steal Hearst 's man offer him double what Hearst pays .
SEITZ: That 's how he stole him from us . Chief , you spend as much as you make fighting Hearst . That 's why the paper 's losing money
PULITZER: I created the World to be the best and I 'll spend whatever it takes to What is that deafening noise ?
SEITZ: Just the Newsies , Chief , I 'll

MEDDA: 'MY LOVEY-DOVEY BABY ' etc .

DAVID: Jack let 's get outta here !
JACK: Maybe tomorrow we get a decent headline .
ESTHER: My God ! What happened ?
DAVID: He 's just sleeping , Momma
MAYER: We 've been waiting dinner where 've you been ?
DAVID: Half of it 's Jack 's he 's ou selling partner . And our friend . This is my parents .
MAYER: Esther maybe David 's partne would like to stay for dinner . Add some more water to the soup .
ESTHER: Mayer !
JACK: What I saw today , I got ta say you oys are born Newsies , Mr. Jacobs . With my experience and their hard work just a little more , thanks I figure we can peddle a thousand a week and not break a sweat .
MAYER: That many ?
JACK: More when the headline 's good .
SARAH: What makes a headline good ?
JACK: Catchy words like , uh , 'corpse ' or 'maniac , ' or , let 's see , 'love nest ' or 'nude ' Sarah and David giggle ; Esther looks shocked .
MAYER: You talk fine , Jack Sarah , get that cake your mother 's been hiding in the cabinet !
ESTHER: That 's for your birthday tomorrow !
MAYER: I 've had enough birthdays ! This is a celebration !
DAVID: It 's only the beginning the longer I work , the more I 'll make
MAYER: You work only until I go back to the factory ! Then you go back to school , like you promised .
LES: ' Gim me all ya got , baby '
JACK: How 'd your pop get hurt ?
DAVID: The factory . An accident . He 's no good to them anymore so they just fired him . He 's got no union to protect him .
MAYER: David ? Time to come in now .
DAVID: Why do n't you stay here tonight ?
DAVID: See you tomorrow . Carryin ' the anner .
JACK: Carryin ' the banner .
JACK: How 'd it go at the track , Race ?
RACETRACK: That hot tip I told you about ? Nobody told the horse . They smile and continue into
KLOPPMAN: You missed your supper , boys .
JACK: I ate , Mr. Kloppman , I I was dinin ' with a family .
JONATHAN: Actual income , as well as projected income , against actual operating costs , as well as projected operating costs , produce a reduced marginality of profit which in turn
PULITZER: Seitz ! What in blazes is he talking about ?
SEITZ: Says you need to make more money , Chief .
PULITZER: Of course I need to make more money ! But how do I make more money , you loodless blot ?
JONATHAN: I have several proposals . The first is to increase the paper 's price
PULITZER: Then Hearst undersells me and I 'm in the poorhouse . Brilliant .
JONATHAN: Not the customer price the price to the distribution apparatus .
SEITZ: You mean the Newsies ? Charge the Newsies more for their papers ? Bad idea , Chief .
JONATHAN: Very well . My next proposal salary cuts , particularly those at the very top
PULITZER: Wait . What do the Newsies pay now fifty cents per hundred papers ? If you raised it to sixty cents
JONATHAN: A mere tenth of a cent per paper
PULITZER: then that , multiplied by forty thousand papers a day , seven days a week well , it would pay some of the bills around here .
SEITZ: Chief , if you do this , every Newsie we got will head straight for Hearst .
PULITZER: Not necessarily . As newspapermen , Hearst and I would cut each other 's throats to get the best of the other . But as businessmen and gentlemen we often agree on ways to keep down certain operating costs . If I know Willie Hearst , he 's going to wish he thought of this himself .
SEITZ: What about the other papers ?
PULITZER: If we do it , they 'll all do it . It 's only a tenth of a cent nobody gets hurt ! It 's good fo the Newsies an incentive , make 'em work harder , sell more papers ! Now get me Hearst on that contraption . Seitz sighs and reaches for the phone .
KID BLINK: They jacked up the price ! Ten
BOOTSY: I 'll be back sleepin ' on * the streets *
MUSH: It do n't make no sense ! All the money Pulitze makes , why would he gouge us ? Jack sees Weasel behind his window , grinning .
JACK: Awright , pipe down ! Do n't you see it 's a gag ? Just Weasel bein ' a weasel . Joke 's over , Wease . Gim me a hunnerd .
WEASEL: Hunnerd 'll cost ya sixty , Cowboy .
JACK: I ai n't payin ' no sixty
WEASEL: Then move outta the way
JACK: You bet I move right over to the Journal .
RACETRACK: It 's the same at the Journal we checked it 's the same everywhere !
JACK: Why the jack-up , Weasel ?
WEASEL: Why not ? It 's a nice day . Why do n't you ast Mr. Pulitzer ?
JACK: It stinks here anyway let 's go !
KID BLINK: They ca n't do that to us
RACETRACK: They can do what they want it 's their stinkin ' paper
BOOTS: Ai n't we got no rights ?
CRUTCHY: Sure we got the right to take it in the t'roat !
RACETRACK: It 's a rigged deck why waste time kiddin ' ourselves ? They set the price , we got ta pay it
MUSH: We got no choice ! So let 's get our lousy papes while they still got some
JACK: Nobody 's goin ' anywhere they ai n't gon na get away with this !
EVERYBODY: What can we do
LES: Stop crowding him ! Let him think !
JACK: One thing for sure . If we do n't sell papes , then nobody sells papes . Nobody comes through those gates 'til they put the price back where it was .
DAVID: You mean like a strike ?
JACK: Yeah , a strike good idea , Dave .
DAVID: No , I did n't mean we ca n't strike , we 're not a union
JACK: We go on strike , we 're a union , ight ? Keep it comin ' , Dave
DAVID: There 's not enough of us maybe if we got every Newsie in New York
JACK: Yeah , we organize we get all the New York Newsies to join us ! This is great , Dave , keep talkin '
DAVID: It 's no joke ! You saw what happened to those trolley workers
JACK: Another great idea ! Any Newsie do n't join with us , we soak 'im just like the trolley workers !
DAVID: Nooo ! Stop and think , willya ? You ca n't just rush everybody into this !
JACK: Dave 's right again ! We got ta think this through ! Old man Pulitzer and Hearst and all them other rich geezers , they run this city . Do we eally think a buncha streetrats like us would have a chance against people like them ?
LES: Strike ! The boys explode a beat begins to build
BOOTS: Keep talkin ' , Jack tell us what to do
DAVID: Uh uh Pulitzer and Hearst have to respect our rights
JACK: Pulitzer and Hearst have to respect the workin ' boys of New York ! Keep it comin ' what else .
DAVID: Uh they ca n't treat us like we do n't exist
NEWSIE: NO ! DAVID If we stick together like the trolley workers , they ca n't break us up .
NEWSIES: NO !
DAVID: It 's like a union . The Newsboy 's Union . Are we really a union ?
BOOTS: What 's to stop someone else from sellin ' our papes ?
JACK: We talk to 'em .
RACETRACK: Some of 'em do n't hear so good .
JACK: Then we soak 'em .
DAVID: No !
DAVID: No ! We ca n't beat up kids in the street ! It 'll destroy what we 're trying to do !
NEWSIES: NO !
DAVID: Ambassadors .
JACK: Right ! You guys got ta be embastards and tell 'em we 're on strike !
KID BLINK: I 'll take Harlem !
RACETRACK: I got mid-town ! CRUTCHY The Bronx ! MUSH I 'll get da Bowery !
JACK: Bumlet , Specs , Skittery take Queens ; Pie Eater and Snotty , the East side Snipeshooter , go with 'em ; okay , who wants Brooklyn ? Spot Conlon 's territory ?
BOOTS: We ai n't scared of Brooklyn . But Spot Conlon makes us a little nervous .
JACK: Well , he do n't make me nervous . You and me , Boots , we take Brooklyn . Dave can keep us company . Okay , Dave ?
DAVID: Sure . Right after you take ou demands to Pulitzer .
JACK: Me ? To Pulitzer ?
DAVID: You 're the leader .
JACK: Maybe the kid 'll soften him up a little .
DENTON: What 's going on ?
DAVID: They 're going in to present ou demands to Pulitzer .
DENTON: What demands ?
DAVID: The Newsies ' demands . We 're on strike .
DENTON: I 'm Denton , New York Sun . What 's your name ?
DAVID: David
DENTON: David . As in David and Goliath ? You really think old man Pulitzer 's going to listen to your demands ?
DAVID: He has to .
JACK: So 's your ol ' lady ! Tell Pulitze he needs an appointment with me !
LES: Real hoity-toity
JACK: So I says , ' I ai n't in the habit of transactin ' business with no office boy tell him Jack Kelly is here to see him now . '
LES: That 's when they threw us out .
DENTON: Does n't it scare you going up against the most powerful man in New York ?
JACK: Yeah , lookit me , I 'm tremblin ' .
DENTON: Keep me informed I want to know everything that happens .
DAVID: Are we really an important story ?
DENTON: What 's important ? A year ago I covered the war in Cuba charging up San Juan Hill with Colonel Teddy Roosevelt . A very important story . Now it does n't seem so important except Teddy 's our governor and probably on his way to the White House . Is the Newsies ' strike important ? It all depends on you .
JACK: My name really gon na be in the papers ?
DENTON: Any objections ?
JACK: Not as long as you get it right Kelly , Jack Kelly . And , Denton ? No pictures .
DAVID: I 've never been to Brooklyn have you guys ?
BOOTS: Spent a month there one night .
DAVID: This Spot Conlon is he really as bad as they say ?
SPOT: If it ai n't Jack be nimble , Jack e quick .
JACK: You 're movin ' up in the world , Spot got a ocean view and everything .
SPOT: So I 'm hearin ' things from little irdies in Harlem and Queens and all over . They 're chirpin ' in my ear 'Jackie-boy 's Newsies are playin ' like they 're goin ' on strike '
DAVID: We 're not playing we are on strike it 's
SPOT: What 's this , Jackie boy ? Some kind of walkin ' mouth ?
JACK: It 's a mouth with a brain and if you got half-a-one you 'll listen . Tell 'im , Davey .
DAVID: Uh we started the strike but we ca n't do it alone , so we 've een talkin ' to Newsies all ove the city
SPOT: So they told me . And what did they tell you ?
DAVID: That they 're all waiting to see what Spot Conlon does . That you 're the key That Spot Conlon is the most espected and famous newsie in New York and probably everywhere else
SPOT: You 're right . Brains . But I got brains , too and more than half-a-one . How do I know you punks wo n't run the first time some goon comes atcha with a club ? How do I know you 're in it to win ?
JACK: 'Cause I 'm tellin ' you .
SPOT: Not good enough , Jackie-boy . You got ta show me .
JACK: Maybe you lost your guts , Spotty- oy or maybe you traded 'em to some chicken for that beak of yours . Maybe you got ta show me you ai n't afraid to join the strike .
SPOT: Nice try , pal . But that 's just what I 'm talkin ' about . Show me this strike ai n't just some kids do-or-dare , then we 'll talk .
RACETRACK: So where 's Spot Conlon ? Jack looks disgustedly at the activity .
JACK: He was concerned about us bein ' serious you imagine that ? Some Newsies gather around , concerned .
KID BLINK: Without Spot and the others , there ai n't enough of us
MUSH: Maybe we 're movin ' too soon , maybe we ai n't ready
SKITTERY: Definitely should put this off a coupla days , definitely
PIE EATER: Hey , Jack you ready ? I 'm eady ! He 's swinging a picket sign .
JACK: At least somebody 's got the right idea .
PIE EATER: Who else is ready for stick-ball ?
JACK: Who we kiddin ' here . Spot was ight . Just a game to these guys
CRUTCHY: Hey , Jack get a loada this !
ALL: PROUD AND DEFIANT WE 'LL SLAY THE GIANT LET US SEIZE THE DAY
ALL: NEIGHBOR TO NEIGHBOR FATHER TO SON ONE FOR ALL AND ALL FOR ONE
DAVID: Throw down your papers ! Join the strike !
JACK: Cheezit the bulls !
SEITZ: I do n't think they 're just going to go away , Chief .
WEASEL: Just give me the means , Mr. Pulitzer . I 'll take care of them for you .
PULITZER: Give him whatever 'means ' he equires , I want this nuisance over and done with .
JACK: The House of Refuge my home- sweet-home
DAVID: How can you be sure they sent Crutchy here ?
JACK: How can I be sure the Delanceys stink 'cause that 's how things work . An orphan gets arrested , Snyder gets him sent here to be 'rehabilitated ' the more kids in the Refuge , the more money the city sends to take care of 'em , and the more Snyder can steal . He 's here alright .
TENPIN: Cowboy ! Ya miss the joint ?
JACK: Whattayasay , Tenpin . You got a new guy , Crutchy
TENPIN: The gimp ? I 'll get him for ya .
JACK: That 's Tenpin s'posed to get out last Christmas but Snyde keeps tackin ' more time on his sentence
DAVID: Be quiet they 'll hear you !
CRUTCHY: Hey , whattaya hangin ' around here for ? That Dave up there ? Hiya , Dave !
JACK: Go get your hat , Crutch kiss Snyder good-bye .
CRUTCHY: Yeah hey , shoulda seen me in court today old Judge Movealong Monahan hisself ! Took him two minutes to move me along to Snyder for 'my own good . '
JACK: Later , Crutchy get your stuff . Crutchy stops Jack 's hand prying at the bars .
CRUTCHY: Listen , Jack truth is , I ai n't walkin ' so good . Oscar and Morris kinda worked me over a little
JACK: They hurt you ? Do n't worry , we 'll carry you
CRUTCHY: I do n't want nobody carryin ' me never !
DAVID: Teddy Roosevelt 's . Right ?
CRUTCHY: You already heard the story .
DAVID: You mean it 's true ?
JACK: Crutchy wo n't last in there I seen stronger guys than him not make it .
DAVID: Did you really escape in Teddy Roosevelt 's coach ?
JACK: Not in it . On it .
DAVID: What was he doing at the Refuge ?
JACK: Runnin ' for governor . Showin ' his concern , like all pols during elections .
DAVID: Teddy 's not like other politicians . He 's the biggest hero in the country .
JACK: Anyway , he 's there . I see his fancy coach waitin ' for 'im , so I sneaks on top of it . Teddy gets in and he 's wavin ' goodbye , and all the guys are wavin ' goodbye , and Snyder 's wavin ' 'Good-byeeee , Colonel Roosevelt ! ' So just as we 're goin ' out the gate , I stands up and 'Good-byeee , Warden Snyder ! ' It was in the papes and everything .
DAVID: He 's governor now . I do n't understand how he could see that place and not do anything
JACK: He only seen what Snyder wanted him to good food , everything the city pays for that Snyder usually steals .
DAVID: I 'll bet if he just knew I mean , he 's a hero
JACK: Last year he was a hero . This yea he 's a politician .
WEASEL: Okay , 'newsies ' you check the funny papers this morning ?
DAVID: Join us ! Join us ! etc .
JACK: Look out !
DENTON: Why do n't you stop this ?
WEASEL: Strike 's over , boys .
SPOT: So , ya showed me ! Now I 'll show you what Brooklyn can do !
RACETRACK: Lookit this just lookit this , willya ?
SPOT: Where 's me pitch ' a ? Where 's me pitch ' a ? BOOTS All them words are they all about us ?
MUSH: Lookit Jack he looks like a general
DAVID: Listen ! Listen up , everybody ! 'Like a small but rising storm , the infant newsboys ' union continues to gather force ' Loud cheers .
MUSH: Hey , ya write sweet , Denton real sweet .
DAVID: 'Their leader is a child of the New York streets with a red bandana and a golden tongue , Jack Kelly '
JACK: Where 's it say that ?
SPOT: Stop t'inkin ' about yaself and let 'im read !
DAVID: 'The latest clash demonstrates that the publishers might do well to econsider their strategy of just waiting out the strike ' * That 's their plan ? To just wait us out ?
DENTON: You 're kids . They think you 'll get tired , or bored , or maybe just too hungry . And with my colleagues on the other dailies not allowed to cover you
JACK: We ai n't goin ' away . We 'll neve go away .

JACK: We got money , Medda . Some , anyway .
DAVID: We 'll take a collection at the door . We 'll pay whatever you ask .
MEDDA: It 's not the money . I depend on the papers . They write good things about me , the customers flock here like sheep . They give me the pan , I 'm the one who gets sheared .
DAVID: You 're afraid of them , too
JACK: Medda 's got ta look out for herself same as anybody . We 'll find another place .
DAVID: How can they make a whole city afraid ? We 're the ones putting our necks on the line all we need is for somebody to have the guts to stand up and show them we 're not alone !
MEDDA: They have the power to destroy people
DAVID: They ca n't destroy you if you fight them only if you let them own you !
MEDDA: You are so young
MEDDA: Do n't thank me . Thank Mr. Wisenheimer Guilt-maker of 1899 there .
KLOPPMAN: Can I help you ?
SNYDER: Do you have a 'Jack Kelly ' egistered here ? I wish to see him .
KLOPPMAN: 'Jack Kelly ? ' Any of you boys know a 'Jack Kelly ' ?
SNIPESHOOTER: Unusual name for these parts . SKITTERY I knew a Jack somebody once . Prob'ly not the same guy .
RACETRACK: You mean Jack Kelly ?
SNYDER: I have reason to believe he 's an escaped prisoner . Possibly dangerous .
KLOPPMAN: Oh , dear me dangerous ? My files are in the rear this way , please .
RACETRACK: Give to the Newsies strike fund , mista ?
SARAH: Did you sleep there ? Why did n't you wake us up ?
JACK: Did n't wan na disturb nobody anyway , it 's like the Waldorf out here great view , cool air She glances back in the apartment .

JACK: Sounds like you and Dave do n't do nothin ' but talk about me .
SARAH: We do not .
JACK: Not that I blame you me bein ' such an interestin ' guy and all
SARAH: Are you ?
JACK: What 'd I tell ya interestin ' , ight ?
MAYOR: Of course the city is very concerned that this , uh , event does n't get out of hand , but Chief ?
CHIEF: We ca n't just charge in and break it up , Mr. Pulitzer we got no legal cause .
PULITZER: Would the fact that this rally is organized by an escaped criminal e cause enough , Mayor ?
MAYOR: An escaped criminal ?
PULITZER: A fugitive from one of you prisons , Mayor a convicted thief who 's been at large for some time under the alias of 'Jack Kelly . ' His real name is ?
SNYDER: Sullivan , Your Honor Francis Sullivan . I would have caught him efore now but
PULITZER: You know Warden Snyder , do n't you , Mayor ? I believe you appointed him .
MAYOR: If this boy is a fugitive , then the chief can quietly arrest him and
PULITZER: Not quietly I want an example made . I want this rabble he 's oused to see what happens to those who dare to well , they should see justice in action .
MAYOR: Arrest him at the rally ? But
PULITZER: By the way , Mayor , I 'm having a few friends for cards that night newspaper friends , Willie Hearst , Gordon Bennett . Perhaps you 'll join us we can talk about the coming election .
MAYOR: I 'd be honored thank you .

SPOT: I do n't care what they say some of us ai n't made to just take it ! I say anybody hurts us , we hurts them worst ! Who 's with me ?
JACK: That 's right start fightin ' each other ! Prove what the big shots say is true we 're street ats with no brains and no respect for nothin ' includin ' ourselves ! Here 's how it is we do n't stick together , we 're nothin ' . We do n't trust each other , we 're nothin ' . We do n't act together , we 're nothin ' and we might as well go back to the streets where we belong . What 's it gon na be ? Whattaya say , Spot ?
SPOT: I say
MEDDA: Hiya , Newsies what 's new ? They roar ; Racetrack 's on his feet
RACETRACK: Hey , Medda , anytime you 're off to the races , remember I got all the winners !

BAILIFF: Awrise , awrise , court is now in session , Judge E.A . Monahan presiding .
MONAHAN: Any of you represented by counsel ? No ? Good . That 'll move things along considerably .

JACK: Hiya , fellas ! Hey , Denton guess we made all the papes this time , huh ? How 'd my picture look ?
DENTON: None of the papers covered the ally . Not even The Sun .

SNYDER: Judge Monahan , I 'll speak for this young man
JACK: You two know each other ? Ai n't that nice .

SNYDER: This boy 's real name is Francis Sullivan ; mother deceased ; father a convict in the state penitentiary
JACK: Like demandin ' you give us the food you steal from us
SNYDER: Followed by an additional six months for an attempted escape
JACK: Last time was n't no attempt , emember , Snyder ? Me and Teddy Roosevelt wavin ' bye-bye
SNYDER: Therefore , I ask that he be eturned to the House of Refuge
JACK: For my own good , right , Movealong ? and for what Snyde kicks back to ya
SNYDER: And that the court order his incarceration until the age of twenty-one
MONAHAN: So ordered . Next .
KID BLINK: He wo n't be there long the jail ai n't built that Jack ca n't bust outta .

RACETRACK: So where 's Denton ?
DAVID: He said he 'd be here . We ca n't let this stop us . We got ta keep the strike going , just like Jack was here .
MUSH: Yeah , but Jack ai n't here .
RACETRACK: We know that , genius if he was here , he 'd be tellin ' us what to do when he ai n't here .
SPOT: You bummers is givin ' me a headache .
DAVID: Where you goin ' ? We need you .
SPOT: Nachally Spot Conlon is needed wherever which right now is Brooklyn . Some of my boys is worried , I must give ear to thei concerns
DAVID: Why did n't The Sun print the story ?
DENTON: Because it never happened .
DENTON: If it 's not in the papers , then it never happened . The owners decreed that it not be in the papers , therefore I just came to tell you fellows goodbye .
DAVID: Denton , what 's happened you get fired or somethin ' ? Denton forces a breezy tone .
DENTON: Reassigned back to my old jo as The Sun 's ace war correspondent . The owner thinks I should be covering only the 'really important ' stories . So wish me luck , boys . At least half what I wish you . They do n't always fire you , David .
DAVID: They bought you off did n't they ? Did n't they !
DENTON: They could 've blackballed me from every paper in the country . I 'm a newspaperman , I have to have a paper to write for .
MUSH: Where they takin ' him ?
DAVID: One way to find out . Meet me back at the square !
SEITZ: Get him inside .
JACK: Very impressive . So where do they keep the trains in this station ?
PULITZER: Know what I was doing when I was your age ? I was in a war . The Civil War .
JACK: I heard of it . You win ?
PULITZER: People think wars are about right and wrong . They 're not . They 're about power . You know what powe is ?
JACK: Heard of that , too . I do n't just sell ya papes , Joe . Sometimes I read 'em .
PULITZER: Power means that I could see to it that you serve your full sentence at the Refuge . Or I could pull strings and have you free tomorrow . It means I could give you my pocket change and you 'd have more money than you 'd likely eve earn .
JACK: You bribin ' me , Joe ? Thanks fo the compliment , but I ai n't got the power to stop the strike
PULITZER: I disagree . You 're the spirit of the strike , without you , they 'd fall apart in a few days .
JACK: Ring for my coach , willya ? It 's past my bedtime
PULITZER: Shut your mouth and listen ! You 're going to do exactly as I say
JACK: or what ? You 'll send me back to the Refuge ? I 'll bust out again
PULITZER: and be a fugitive who 's pursued and caught and returned . I 'm offering you a choice is that what you choose ?
JACK: I told ya I ca n't call off the strike .
PULITZER: I 'm not asking you to . All I ask is that you return to your old job as Newsie for the The World .
JACK: And be a scab ? Forget it
PULITZER: For a few days . Then the strike ends and it will end , boy , make no mistake and you can go wherever you want to buy a ticket . Free and clear , with money in you pocket and no one chasing you .
DAVID: Jack !
SNYDER: After him !
SEITZ: Do n't worry . He 's got no place to go .
DAVID: Why 're you stoppin ' we 've got to run !
JACK: You should n't ' a done this , David . They could put you in jail
DAVID: It 's worth it let 's go
JACK: You go to jail , what happens to your family ? You do n't know nothin ' about jail ! Thanks fo what you done , but you got ta get outta here
DAVID: I do n't understand
JACK: I do n't either I do n't understand nothin ' no more ! Jack pushes David down the street .
CRUTCHY: Snitched it offa Snyder 's plate when I was servin ' him the iggest one ! Snyder was eatin ' good tonight
JACK: So what 's it git'cha ?
CRUTCHY: Anudder three months , prob'ly . But you ca n't let 'em beat'cha , ight , Jack ?
JACK: We was beat when we was born .
NEWSIES: Stop The World do n't scab , stop The World do n't scab , etc .
DAVID: Nobody sells a pape today we 're hurtin ' them and they know it ! Remember no soakin ' , no hittin ' etc .

DAVID: This is why you would n't escape last night why 'd you do it ? Talk to me , you liar ! What else did he give you to sell us out money ? What else ? Look at me ! You lie about everything headlines , your family because nobody counts but you nobody or nothing ! Look at me .
WEASEL: I 'm gon na be lookin ' for you , wiseguy or maybe you 'd like a nice new suit of your own .

JACK: They got it all wrapped up , Sarah and nothin ' I can do is gon na make one bit of difference .
SARAH: You 're wrong . You touched people you do n't even know about . She removes the stained pages from her shawl .
JACK: Denton looked out for hisself just like I got ta do so save it .
SARAH: Just listen ! 'The men who run this city are terrified of the Newsies strike because othe child laborers in the factories and sweatshops are hearing the message of the Newsies leader '
LES: That 's you ! He 's writin ' about you !
SARAH: 'In the voice of Jack Kelly , these children hear strength and pride . Most of all , they hear hope ' Jack listens questioningly .
JACK: Keep reading .
DENTON: ' And that is what terrifies the powers-that-be , for they know our city thrives on the shame of child labor . Therefore , Jack Kelly 's voice must be stopped , whatever the cost Damn good writing , is n't it ?
JACK: All them sweatshop kids are listenin ' to me ?
DENTON: They think if the Newsies can do it , why ca n't they ? All they need is a leader .
JACK: The minute I show my face , I 'm ack in the Refuge .
DENTON: You 'd have help this time . I 've een investigating the Refuge I know somebody who 's going to be very interested in Snyder 's little acket .

LES: NO !
MAYOR: They 're all yelling at me me ! factory owners , bankers , usinessmen the whole city 's at a standstill and they 're blaming it on me !
PULITZER: Kelly 's down there . He should be ack in jail .
SEITZ: Those kids got out a pretty good paper , Chief .
PULITZER: Too good ! Those illiterate guttersnipes could n't have done this on their own . Somebody 's ehind this , trying to pull a fast one
JONATHAN: Mr. Hearst on the line , sir . Wants to know if you 've read the Newsies ' paper ?
MAYOR: I 'm not taking the heat for this you 've got to talk to them settle it
PULITZER: Tell Hearst I 'm busy ! I 'll settle it all right once and for all .
SEITZ: It 's time to talk .
JACK: Like I said , I do n't transact usiness with no office boys . We talk to old Joe hisself or we do n't talk . Period .
SEITZ: Then I guess you talk .
PULITZER: You 're going to listen to me , oy
JACK: I 'd like to , Joe but I ca n't hear ya .
PULITZER: We had a deal you broke it . You 're going back to jail .
JACK: Maybe . But you ca n't put every kid in that square in jail . They ai n't goin ' away , Joe .
PULITZER: Neither am I. I can wait them out . It wo n't be me that 's hurt .
JACK: You sure about that ? He nods at David who produces a paper , reads
DAVID: 'Since the strike , the World 's circulation has dropped 70 pe cent ; advertising has been cut in half ' Every day you lose thousands of dollars just so you can beat us out of a lousy tenth of a cent per paper . Why ?
JACK: It ai n't about money , Dave if Joe gives in , that would mean nothin 's like us got power . He ca n't let that happen no matte what it costs him . Right , Joe ?
PULITZER: I 'm about to show you what powe eally is
DAVID: You lousy double-crossing !
PULITZER: then I 'll deal with that rabble in the street .
JACK: Ya got me , Joe but tell me one thing , willya ? How 'd ya like ou paper nice printin ' , ai n't it ? Right off the presses of one of New York 's greatest newspapers
PULITZER: All the papers have an agreement we print nothing about the newsies . Whose press did you use ? It was Hearst , was n't it !
JACK: Hearst ? Nah , it was yo
PULITZER: I knew it . Whoever helped you print this lying rag is trying to eak the strike , get the jump on the rest of us . Well , you 're going to expose this backstabbe to the other owners in exchange , I 'll call off the police .
JACK: Not enough , Joe you got ta deal with our demands . Otherwise , ou lips are sealed .
PULITZER: All right , all right just say the traitor 's name . It 's Hearst , is n't it ? Say it ! Say the name of the scoundrel whose press you used so I can make him the disgrace of the newspaper world ! Say his name , damn you !
JACK: We just wan na say , 'Thanks , Joe . ' And Hearst and them other owners ? Maybe they do n't have to know . Depends .
PULITZER: Perhaps we can resolve our small differences .
RACE: We got ta warn Jack !

CRIS: Well , you can save your breath . Cause I know what you 're gon na say .
GUY: Then you 're aware that Neal is in a serious cash crunch and could lose it all .
CRIS: I 'm sorry to hear that . But I 'm done playing the market .
GUY: Neal 's got it all worked out . He 'll fly you out of the country on his jet . Put you up in style . He pays taxes , totally legal . You get cash , squeaky clean . Half the net . When your share hits fifty mil , you can say `` finito '' and it 's over .
CRIS: Except last time , Neal did n't take `` finito '' for an answer .
GUY: You need us , asshole ! The Law is eathin ' down your neck !
CRIS: I can stay ahead of ` em forever .
GUY: But why live that way ?
CRIS: Because I do n't want to be used any more .
GUY: What do you give a shit as long as you get what you want ?
CRIS: Cause what I want is freedom . And you do n't get it by giving it up .
GUY: The jet 'll be sold in a week . Then there goes your ticket out .
CRIS: Do n't wait for me .
CAVANAUGH: He 's just some gambler . Lives completely off the grid . No bank account . No credit cards . No previous record .
IRV: What are you doing back here ?
CRIS: I came to fix you dinner .
IRV: Idiot .
CRIS: Sometimes not knowing is better .
IRV: Look where you 're headed , pal . The ig decisions are over before you even realize you made ` em .
GUY: I 've got a little problem with the IRS . Think I could get some relief ?
FERRIS: Depends how helpful you are .
GUY: And another thing , no woman eve turns him down , I 'm serious . Mainly ecause he only propositions the ones he knows 'll say yes , which is most of ` em anyway . But does that make him happy ? No . Says he 's ored . Never surprised . Has to watch himself die over and ove again .
FERRIS: Why 'd he come back to Vegas ?
GUY: Did n't say , but I 'm guessin ' it 's this friend who 's dying . An old fart who took him in when he was strung out on drugs . - He 's an orphan , ya know . Been on the road since he was ten .
IRV: You want my advice ? Get yourself a good lawyer and turn yourself in .
CRIS: If I tell ` em the truth , you know what happens ? I end up with the Feds . - And you know what they do to me ?
IRV: Make you a secret agent .
CRIS: It 's not funny , Irv . That 's all I do , day after day , for the rest of my life . Watch the news until I lose my hair and croak .
IRV: In that case , you 've got ta leave the country .
CRIS: I know , I know , but there 's something I got ta do first .
IRV: What ?
CRIS: She 's coming here . The Fed .
IRV: You got ta go ?
CRIS: Let 's play it out .
IRV: Then what the hell are you waiting for ?
CRIS: Her .
IRV: Who ?
CRIS: I have n't met her yet .
IRV: Then find somebody else !
CRIS: It has to be her .
IRV: What 's so special about this one ?
CRIS: She 's the mother of my child .
IRV: I thought you were shooting blanks .
CRIS: I guess the doctors were wrong .
IRV: I do n't mean to be indelicate , my friend , but how do you know the little bastard is yours ?
CRIS: He 's got my thing .
IRV: Your thing ?
CRIS: My thing .
IRV: I still do n't understand why you never got that fixed .
CRIS: Agent Ferris , come in .
FERRIS: One step ahead of the game .
CRIS: Let 's go in the kitchen . I 've got a oast in the oven .
FERRIS: You 're wasting your life , Cris . You have the most amazing talent , and you 're running from it .
CRIS: Yeah , people say I could have been a chef .
FERRIS: Now if you say that man in the liquor store was going to shoot five people , I believe you . Why else would you kill a stranger ?
CRIS: Everyone but you , of course .
FERRIS: I can fix your legal problems . More importantly , I can give you a chance to use your gift .
CRIS: Trust me , it 's better if I do n't . It 's better if I just mind my own usiness .
FERRIS: I 'll be honest with you , Cris . That 's not an option . Your country needs you . And if we do n't gra you , somebody else will .
CRIS: Nobody 's grabbed me yet .
FERRIS: I 'd like you to come with me fo some testing . Would you be willing to do that ?
IRV: In that case , you 've got ta leave the country .
CRIS: I know , I know , I 've got the place picked out . But there 's something I 've got ta do first .
IRV: What ?
CRIS: I have to go .
IRV: You just got here .
CRIS: I know , but they 're coming for me .
IRV: You 're gon na need it .
CRIS: I looked , Irv , I really did . I went down every path , every treatment . Sometimes there 's just no
IRV: It 's okay . It 's okayNow I can elax .
FERRIS: I need him alive , Cavanaugh . Even if he resists .
CAVANAUGH: Yes , ma'am .
FERRIS: Tell them .
CRIS: Mind if I join you ?
LIZ: Yeah , actually I do .
CRIS: Is that cruller any good ?
LIZ: What business is it of yours ?
CRIS: Rough day ?
LIZ: Aw Christ ! Look what you 've done !
CRIS: I 'm so sorry . I 'm a spaz .
LIZ: Yeah , you are .
CRIS: Why would I do that ?
LIZ: I do n't know . To impress me ?
CRIS: Look , I 'm sorry . If I could , I 'd do it over .
LIZ: How 's that ?
CRIS: You met me .
LIZ: And what are you , a leprechaun ?
CRIS: An angel , actually . And we always eward the people who help us .
LIZ: Great , what do I have to do ?
CRIS: You do n't have to do anything .
LIZ: When does the luck kick in ?
CRIS: It already has .
LIZ: I do n't feel anything .
CRIS: Not even a tingle ?
LIZ: Son , I have n't had a tingle in eight months .
CRIS: Then you 're way overdue . For a eversal of fortune .
LIZ: Thirty . I teach fifth grade .
CRIS: I mean of your own .
LIZ: No , that was the problem . - I could n't get pregnant .
CRIS: I 'm sorry . I did n't mean to pry .
LIZ: You did n't . I 'm just running off at the mouth . - That 's why I was in Vegas . To see another doctor .
CRIS: He did n't want to adopt ?
LIZ: No , he had to have a Randy Junior .
CRIS: It already has .
LIZ: I do n't feel anything .
CRIS: Take this exit . Quick !
LIZ: Why ?
CRIS: Just take it !
LIZ: It 's too late !
CRIS: No it 's not !
LIZ: Let go ! Are you out of your mind ? !
CRIS: Traffic was piling up . You did n't see it ?
LIZ: GET OUT ! !
CRIS: We could ' a been stuck there fo hours .
LIZ: I do n't give a flyin ' goddamn ! You do n't grab the steering wheel !
CRIS: You 're right . I 'm sorry . I panicked . I get phobic sitting in traffic . It wo n't happen again , I promise .
LIZ: Damn straight , cause you wo n't be in the car !
CRIS: How ` bout at the next gas station ? Please . I 'll fill up your tank .
FERRIS: Long enough to know we 're not gon na catch him by surprise .
CAVANAUGH: What , you think he 's got some kind of radar ?
FERRIS: Interesting idea . It 'd explain a whole lot .
CAVANAUGH: And Area 51 would explain my missing tennis shoes . But that does n't mean they 're on a flying saucer .
FERRIS: In this case , it does .
CRIS: I am really really really really sorry .
CAVANAUGH: I 'd call your proof a little iffy .
FERRIS: Look , from your own experience , this guy ca n't be punched , shot , surprised , captured , or confined . So either he 's got something special , or you 're an idiot .
CAVANAUGH: Let 's say I 'm not an idiot
FERRIS: And I 'm not saying you are .
CAVANAUGH: Then what ?
FERRIS: We 've got to think like he does . We 've got to think ahead .
CRIS: But lately I 've been traveling all around Oregon . It 's really peaceful up there .
LIZ: All right , I 'm starting getting the picture . - Basically , you 're a no- good , worthless ramblin ' man who 's never held a job in life .
CRIS: Exactly .
LIZ: This is where I turn into town .
CRIS: Well , thanks for the ride .
LIZ: Thanks for the card .
CRIS: You 're welcome .
LIZ: No , no , I 've got ta teach tomorrow .
CRIS: I understandWell , see ya .
LIZ: So long .
CRIS: Sierra Pale .
LIZ: He 's not here now , is he ?
CRIS: Just a friend .
LIZ: I 'm not yours anymore , asshole !
RANDY: You still care for me , I know it .
CRIS: Easy , man .
LIZ: Get out of here ! Get out !
RANDY: You still care for me , I know it .
CRIS: Easy , man .
LIZ: Stop it , Randy ! Stop it !
CRIS: No ho'pital . I don ' nee ' ho'pital .
LIZ: God , I hate that bastardWill somebody get some ice !
CRIS: I 'm sorry I 'm causing you all this trouble .
LIZ: Are you kidding ? You stood up fo me .
CRIS: Actually , I was n't standing fo that long .
LIZ: Sorry it 's so cold in here . The heater 's broken .
CRIS: Why did n't you ?
LIZ: Cause I do n't leave . I never have . My boyfriends always left me .
CRIS: What a terrible quality . You 're too loyal .
LIZ: Sit in the light .
CRIS: Once you start watching , it 's hard not to get involved .
LIZ: You ever been married ?
CRIS: Almost .
LIZ: What happened ?
CRIS: She wanted kids .
LIZ: And you did n't ?
CRIS: It 's just thatI ca n't .
LIZ: Why are you telling me this ? These personal details .
CRIS: I do n't know . You asked andI guess I felt like you 'd understand .
LIZ: That wasI 've never
WISDOM: So basically we 've got nothing .
FERRIS: You know you 're very sexy when you 're ruthless .
WISDOM: We 're groping in the dark .
FERRIS: My guy 's got a flashlight . We just need to bring him in .
WISDOM: I 'll see if Baines can spare some manpower .
LIZ: What the hell are you doing ?
CRIS: You said it was broken .
LIZ: Well , you 're not leaving till it 's fixed , I 'll tell you that .
FERRIS: This one first .
BAINES: What is it ?
FERRIS: A trap for somebody who can see the future .
BAINES: If you say so .
FERRIS: And then these .
LIZ: And what was the main staple of their diet ?
SHY GIRL: No . From the rivers .
LIZ: Right . And the Washo were so jealous of their fishing grounds that when other Native Americans came to trade for dried fish , they were only permitted to remain one night .
CRIS: I - I did n't think of it . - I thought you 'd be happy to see me .
LIZ: Well next time exercise a little forethought , okay ?
CRIS: Do you want me to leave these somewhere ?
LIZ: No .
CRIS: All right then . I 'll just go .
LIZ: Put a few in the freezer . I love ice cream sandwiches .
CRIS: I 've got a better idea . Run away with me to the South Pacific .
LIZ: Funny . We 've only known each othe a week .
CRIS: But we 're going to be happy together for the rest of our lives . Really , I peeked .
LIZ: I think you 're serious .
CRIS: Deadly .
LIZ: And what 'll we do for money ?
CRIS: Do n't worry . That 's always been easy for me .
LIZ: This is ridiculous .
CRIS: Why ?
LIZ: Well , first of all , it 's the middle of the school year .
CRIS: They 'll replace you .
LIZ: And I 'm in charge of science fair .
CRIS: They can pick up the slack .
LIZ: It disturbs me , Cris , that you think it 's okay just to duck you esponsibilities .
CRIS: I - I do n't think it 's okay . I 'm not that kind of person . But I have this feeling , this very strong feeling , that it has to be now . We have to leave soon , or it 's not gon na work out .
LIZ: I do n't believe that . If it 's meant to be between two people , somehow it 'll happen .
CRIS: Yes , but sometimes you have to make it happen . You have to seize the opportunity before it 's too late .
LIZ: What are you afraid of , Cris ? Why are you running away from yourself ?
CRIS: Your students are very lucky .
LIZ: Now I 've got to grade papers .
CRIS: But then you have to sign the divorce papers .
LIZ: Cris .
CRIS: I said I 'll pay .
DRIVER: You 're damn right you 'll pay ! I wan na talk to the cops .
CRIS: No need for that . I 'll give you cash . Okay ? Will you take cash ?
DRIVER: Make it three .
CRIS: Okay , three .
LIZ: So you throw rocks at them ?
CRIS: What do you want me to do ? Wait fo people to die ?
LIZ: CrisI think you should move on . Today .
CRIS: Look , there 's something I 've been wanting to tell you .
LIZ: It does n't matter .
CRIS: It does .
CAVANAUGH: I know .
LIZ: What are you saying , you 're some sort of prophet ?
CRIS: It 's not religious . I just happen to see my life before it happens .
LIZ: Cris , it 's sweet that you feel esponsible for people . But I think you need help .
CRIS: Flip it .
LIZ: Why ?
CRIS: Just do it .
LIZ: Yeah . And I do n't want to have anything to do with you .
CRIS: Liz . Do n't you see ? I can get us all the money we need .
LIZ: Do n't follow me . Do n't talk to me . Get out of my life !
CRIS: Why ? Because I care so much about kids that sometimes I overreact ?
POLICEMAN RICK: Hard to say . She 's impossible to control .
LIZ: I swear , I ca n't figure you out .
CRIS: Believe me , the feeling is mutual .
LIZ: Sometimes you seem mindlessly impulsive . But other times I feel like you 're utterly calculating , saying exactly what you think 'll push my buttons .
CRIS: What do you mean ?
LIZ: Do n't you think it 's kind of an amazing coincidence that neither of us can have kids ?
CRIS: You want to talk to my doctor ? I 'll get him on the phone . No , really , I mean it . I 'll have him send you my ecords . Because I want you to trust me .
LIZ: Then open up . Talk to me . Where are you going with your life ?
CRIS: All the time . - But mainly how to stay out of trouble .
LIZ: No goals ? Dreams ? Ambitions ?
CRIS: There 's only one thing I 've eve wanted .
LIZ: What 's that ?
CRIS: A family .
LIZ: That 's all ? Just a family ?
CRIS: Well , I was , as they say , left on a doorstep when I was two . Never found foster parents who could put up with me . - So to me , a family sounds like plenty .
LIZ: You 've got to be making this up .
CRIS: I wish .
LIZ: You poor guy .
CAVANAUGH: I say we get the whole department up here and bust his ass .
LIZ: I 'll meet you inside . I need to pick something up at the drug store .
FERRIS: Stay in the car . If he sees you shadow , he wo n't take the bait .
CAVANAUGH: You have n't been chasing him fo three years .
LIZ: Yes ?
FERRIS: Agent Ferris .
LIZ: He 's not a killer . He needs help .
FERRIS: That 's why I came to you .
LIZ: Okay , I 'll talk to him . I 'll try to get him to
FERRIS: Even his best friend says he 'll never turn himself in . - At this stage , there 's only one way to keep him from self-destructing .
LIZ: I ran into a friend I had n't seen in a while .
CRIS: God , this is gorgeous .
LIZ: Nothing .
FERRIS: But silently , right ?
BAINES: Unnoticeably .
CAVANAUGH: And that 's when we go in .
FERRIS: Gentlemen , try to think like him . - If the plan is to go in right afte he 's trapped , he 'll see it coming and he 'll slip away before he 's trapped Like he 's always done .
CAVANAUGH: That kinda makes sense .
FERRIS: The eureka moment is when he ealizes he 's been trapped .
CAVANAUGH: When is that ?
FERRIS: Voila .
RICK: You 're smart .
LIZ: Cris . Do you think we met for a eason ?
CRIS: You mean , do I believe a highe power brought us together ?
LIZ: Yeah .
CRIS: No . I think we 're just the last in a long chain of accidents that started with the Big Bang .
LIZ: That 's not very romantic .
CRIS: Oh , but it is . Think of it For us to meet , everything from the very eginning , every sub-atomic event , every galactic cataclysm , every step of evolution , every act , every accident , every decision in the history of the universe had to happen exactly the way it did just so you and I could be together , ight here and now .
LIZ: I should n't .
CRIS: Why ?
LIZ: I 'm late .
CRIS: Late ?
LIZ: That 's why I went to the drug store . To get a pregnancy test .
CRIS: I do now .
LIZ: How did it ?
CRIS: I have no idea . UnlessBut that still does n't explain
LIZ: It 's like a miracle .
CRIS: For both of us .
FERRIS: Women hate good-looking men . Rejecting them makes us feel powerful .
CRIS: You lying bitch ! You betrayed me !
LIZ: Cris , I know you do n't mean to hurt people . But you need help or you 're going to keep on hurting them .
CRIS: The man I killed was there to ro the store . He was going to panic and shoot five innocent people .
LIZ: How do you know this ?
CRIS: Because I saw them die .
LIZ: Like yesterday , with the car ?
CRIS: Yes .
LIZ: You were afraid something bad might happen so you
CRIS: Not `` might '' ! Those people died ! - They just had n't died yet .
LIZ: What if you had n't done anything ? Have you ever waited to see what would happen ?
CRIS: Once .
CAVANAUGH: What 's taking so long ?
BAINES: We could just do this the old- fashioned way .
LIZ: Cris , you 're a good man . And I will stand by you through this . But you have to
CRIS: If they catch me , they 'll put me in a cell without a trial , and they 'll never let me out . They do that , you know .
LIZ: I wo n't let it happen . I 'll get you a lawyer .
CRIS: There 's one decent path . But if we 're gon na stay on it , I need you to do exactly what I say .
FERRIS: Okay . Wait for my signal .
CRIS: A few steps on , your robe will get caught on a thornbush . You wo n't be able to get unstuck . Ferris and a tough guy will come help you . She 'll say , `` You 've done you country a great service . ''
LIZ: And then ?
CRIS: Be unpredictable . Surprise works to my advantage . - And read this when you 're safe .
LIZ: Will I see you again ?
CRIS: Bet on it .
CAVANAUGH: We stand pat till notified . Do n't make a sound .
FERRIS: What 's she waiting for ?
LIZ: Then why do I feel like a traitor ?
CAVANAUGH: We 've got movement in the canyon . Where are you ?
FERRIS: I want him alive . Tell them .
FERRIS: You 've made a very stupid mistake .
LIZ: I trust him more than I trust you .
FERRIS: But I 've profiled him for months . And I can tell you this he does n't love anybody . How could he ? To him , we 're not even human .
TROOPER 1: I 'm trying !
FERRIS: I underestimated him .
FERRIS: Change of plans , everybody .
FERRIS: No , it 's an order .
BAINES: Damn . Fifty men might not be enough .
FERRIS: Somehow we 've got to bring him down to our level .
BAINES: He 's crossed over into Maxwell Gorge .
FERRIS: Move in fast . Keep him moving . Do n't let him rest .
BAINES: He 's heading this way .
CAVANAUGH: This is your last warning .
CRIS: Believe me now ?
LIZ: I 'm getting used to miracles .
CRIS: Where were you going ?
LIZ: No idea . I was just trying to be unpredictable .
CRIS: I 'll check on our ride .
LIZ: Will we make it ?
CRIS: Right now I 'm just trying to stay alive .
LIZ: Christ , you live dangerously .
CRIS: Just the opposite . I never take chances .
FERRIS: Cavanaugh , get all your men into town . Cavanaugh ? Tell them .
BAINES: Why these ?
FERRIS: Get in the chopper .
CRIS: Did the doctors ever say why you could n't have kids ?
LIZ: I grew up at Love Canal .
CRIS: What 's that ?
LIZ: A neighborhood back East built ove a chemical dump . A bunch of my friends had birth defects . I always figured I was lucky just to be sterile .
CRIS: Except you 're not . And neither am I . We 're different , that 's all . We just had to find the right match .
LIZ: And somehow we did .
BAINES: He does n't miss a beat .
FERRIS: Come to momma .
BAINES: He 's driving right into it
LIZ: You make it look easy .
CRIS: Oh shit . Oh no .
FERRIS: I need your vehicle .
BAINES: What 's the plan ?
FERRIS: Playing chicken .
BAINES: Do n't be stupid ! He knows what you 'll do !
FERRIS: But so do I . And for once , that makes us even .
CRIS: Why does everybody have amnesia but me ?
FERRIS: I only ask one thing from you . Give me a chance to earn your trust .
CRIS: Do n't let them know you 're pregnant .
LIZ: I promise .
CRIS: I 'll get us out of here . We can still make the plane .
FERRIS: This game was different . He knew I would n't flinch .
WISDOM: It 's red now . And we 're out of leads .
FERRIS: Not possible with him .
FERRIS: Cris , we 'll be firing at you with live ammo . Are you ready ?
WISDOM: Not on my watch , you 're not .
FERRIS: I promise you , he wo n't be hit .
WISDOM: It 's your experiment .
CRIS: `` From now on , Cris , the bullets are eal . ''
FERRIS: He 's almost impossible to shoot , hit , surprise , capture , or contain .
WISDOM: Mind if I try ?
FERRIS: Be my guest .
CRIS: I 'm going . No need for a hotfoot .
WISDOM: Whoa , you are one tough bitch .
FERRIS: We 're still in a Code Red if I 'm not mistaken .
WISDOM: He knew he 'd get shocked , but he chose to resist .
FERRIS: He 's almost never had to face consequences . Cris , are you ready to get in the chair ?
WISDOM: Okay , how do we use him to find the ombs ?
FERRIS: Simple . We make him watch the news and tell us about it .
WISDOM: How far ahead can he see ?
FERRIS: I do n't know . But I suspect we can increase his range with practice . Especially if we restrict his future to only watching news . Then he 'll be like a timescope .
WISDOM: You were right . This is huge .
FERRIS: This is just for starters . You want to stage a pre-emptive strike , he can tell you if you 'll hit the target and whether they hit back and what went wrong . And you can do this over and over until you get it perfect before you begin .
WISDOM: Right now , sweetheart , we ca n't even get him to sit in a chair .
FERRIS: Can we deal with your sexual insecurities at another time ?
WISDOM: You mean after it 's too late ?
FERRIS: I told you , he does n't read minds . He sees the results .
WISDOM: Wait for my signal , then go in and surround him .
CRIS: I do n't believe you .
WISDOM: Cris , time is running out .
FERRIS: Do n't give him time . Send them in now .
WISDOM: Baines , do it .
CRIS: Do n't get too attached to your arms and legs .
WISDOM: Do n't let him out of here alive .
FERRIS: If there 's one soft heart , one slow shooter , he 'll know it .
WISDOM: Be careful . I do n't want anything to happen to you .
FERRIS: Get him a local .
WISDOM: Secure the female .
SOLDIER: We 're here to protect you .
SOLDIER: I found him ! In here !
BAINES: I 'm issuing infrared to all my men . We should have a fix in a few minutes .
WISDOM: You realize if he gets away now , we 'll never get him back . He 'll be out there , and he 'll be our enemy .
FERRIS: We do n't actually have to do anything . We just have to decide to do somethingunthinkable .
WISDOM: You want me to threaten to kill a pregnant woman ?
FERRIS: Threats do n't count . When he foresees that you actually did kill her , that she 's dead He wo n't let it happen . - He 'll come to us . Surrender . And she 'll live .
LEO: He 's on this floor ! Shit ! He 's coming here !
FERRIS: He 's getting away .
WISDOM: Any developments on the Code Red ? Let me know if there are .
BAINES: We 're moving her .
SOLDIER: Sit there and shut up .
FERRIS: You understand what 's at stake here ? We 're playing for the future . Not just what happens next , but what the future is . What the rules are .
WISDOM: By killing an innocent woman .
FERRIS: If you want , I 'll pull the trigger .
WISDOM: I think that might bemore eliable .
FERRIS: I 'll join you in a minute . I need to take care of some details .
WISDOM: Get more men up here .
FERRIS: This is Ferris . I 'll need a choppe tanked up and ready .
WISDOM: Where the hell did she get the scissors ?
PATROL LEADER: Hold your fire . We 've got the target in plain sight in Corridor 2C , but he 's holding a hostage . Agent Ferris . - Request instructions .
BAINES: You wo n't believe this . He 's got Ferris .
WISDOM: How ?
BAINES: I do n't know , but he 's on his way to the front door . They want instructions .
WISDOM: Do n't shoot .
BAINES: Then how are we going to stop him ?
WISDOM: We do n't . We let him go . - It 's part of the plan .
BAINES: You 're sure about this ?
WISDOM: No , but Ferris is .
CRIS: He has n't got the balls .
FERRIS: We 'll find out , wo n't we ?
LIZ: You 're not going to kill me . That 's what the bad guys do .
WISDOM: In war , you have to be as ruthless as your enemy .
LIZ: Cris is n't the enemy .
WISDOM: I did n't mean him .
LIZ: Ca n't you just leave us alone ?
FERRIS: God , you 're remarkable .
CRIS: I 'd say you have way too much .
WISDOM: I 'm sorry .
FERRIS: You know what our problem is ?
CRIS: `` We got off on the wrong foot . ''
FERRIS: It 's really
CRIS: `` all been a big misunderstanding . ''
FERRIS: Exactly .
CRIS: `` We 've never meant you any harm . ''
FERRIS: It sounds so insincere when you say it .
CRIS: I guess you 're a better liar than I am .
FERRIS: You know what I 'm going to say next ?
CRIS: It 'll never happen .
FERRIS: My door will be open . We can start from scratch .
CRIS: When are they going to give up ? After you 're dead ?
FERRIS: I see you got our message .
CRIS: What 's about to happenyou 've ought it on yourselves .
CRIS: I 'm planning on it .
CRIS: Get out !
LIZ: This is what they wanted you to prevent ?
CRIS: I guess
LIZ: And you would n't help ?
CRIS: They did n't explain . They were trying to force me .
NEAL: She 's not coming with us ?
FERRIS: Where did you get this number ?

SHOOTING SCRIPT: August 6 , 2009
LARA: You know what ? If you were smart you would stop talking right now .
ERIT: Sue me . I just know that women should never work for women .
LARA: How can you say that ? ?
ERIT: They 're always threatened . Especially if you 're beautiful and they 're not .
LARA: Erit , you are so full of shit .
ERIT: So , your boss is n't threatened by you ?
LARA: Because she 's a bitch ! Not because she 's a woman .
ERIT: And you would describe her as `` attractive '' ?
LARA: That has nothing to do with it !
ERIT: And there is my answer .
JOHN: Either of you like another drink ?
ERIT: Women should work under men , men under women . That 's it .
JOHN: But men under men ?
ERIT: That 's fine , too . They 're used to it ! Why are you laughing ?
MICK: I do n't know , bro , but I think I 'd ather work under you than her .
ERIT: Oh please , I 'd rather work unde him , too .
LARA: You 'd rather `` work under '' John ?
ERIT: You have a problem with that , too ?
LARA: No , why would I have a problem with your little sexual innuendo ?
ERIT: What is up your ass tonight ? ?
LARA: So , I should n't take offense that you 're coming on to my husband right in front of me .
ERIT: Lara , if I wanted your husband I would have him .
LARA: How ? You could n't possibly show him more of your tits .
ERIT: You know what your problem is ? !
JOHN: She is completely full of shit .
LARA: DO N'T try and agree with me now .
JOHN: You know what ? I do n't even believe she is in the dental profession .
LARA: Shut up .
JOHN: I bet she ca n't even spell anesthesiologist . Woman 's a complete fraud .
LARA: We went to her office party , idiot .
JOHN: I think she hit on me that night , too .
LARA: You are completely delusional . She was n't even hitting on you in there ; I just do n't like her .
JOHN: I understand . People who look like that should not be allowed anywhere near oral surgery .
LARA: You are such an asshole .
JOHN: You 're in the chair trying to stay calm ; how are you supposed to do that with those things hanging over your
LARA: Hello !
JENNA: Only when I dropped him down the stairs .
JOHN: Thanks . See you next weekend .
LARA: Squeeze in tight .
JOHN: You ca n't do this every morning . It is way too corny .
LARA: Smile . It 's just until he 's eighteen .
JOHN: Sweetie , you have to stop believing everything you read in a catalogue .
LARA: You hate brushing your teeth ; this one brushes them in thirty seconds .
JOHN: I love brushing my teeth . The lies your mother tells .
LARA: When 's your last class ?
JOHN: Three , and I have papers to grade . Can you pick up Luke ?
LARA: After yesterday I probably do n't have a job anyway . Do you think it was wrong to call her a useless cow ?
JOHN: Bosses admire that kind of frank exchange .
LARA: Did you call your father ?
JOHN: When ?
LARA: `` When ? '' Yesterday , for his birthday !
JOHN: Mom said Happy Birthday and my fathe went . Made me tear up . Lara returns , trying hard not to smile .
LARA: Ever think that someone has to be the bigger person here ?
JOHN: Remember this for the custody hearing how Mommy is always scolding Daddy .
LARA: How are you going to feel if Luke grows up and does n't call you ?
JOHN: Now she 's driving a wedge between us .
LARA: I give up .
JOHN: And now she is abandoning you .
DETECTIVE QUINN: Police . Mr. Brennan ?
JOHN: Get your
DETECTIVE QUINN: Touch me again and you 'll be arrested .
DETECTIVE COLLERO: Lara Brennan ?
LARA: WHAT ? !
DETECTIVE COLLERO: Lara Brennan , you are under arrest for the murder of Elizabeth Gesas .
LARA: She 's dead ? ? Elizabeth is dead ? ?
JOHN: She did n't do anything !
DETECTIVE QUINN: I will only
JOHN: She did n't do anything !
DETECTIVE QUINN: Put him in cuffs .
JOHN: You okay ? Luke nods .
LUKE: Not at lunch .
JOHN: Does he take your food ?
LUKE: No .
JOHN: Did he say something mean ? About Mommy ?
LUKE: Yeah .
JOHN: Did you hit him ?
LUKE: Yeah .
JOHN: Good . Where did you hit him ?
LUKE: Near the swings .
JOHN: Wow . I bet that hurt .
LUKE: Yeah .
JOHN: It 's a toy !
LARA: Hi honey . Can Mommy get a kiss ? Come on , give Mommy a kiss .
JOHN: Rat-Bag . Give Mommy a kiss .
LARA: Is Daddy reading you my letters ?
JOHN: Every night at bedtime .
LARA: What are you building ? A fort ?
JOHN: I walked him to class , gave him a kiss ; he did n't even look back to wave .
LARA: What did you make him for lunch ?
JOHN: Turkey sandwich , just butter and ead , no `` vegetables '' on it . He swore he ate his apple .
LARA: Look at his friends . And his desk . This is his teacher ?
JOHN: Miss Phillips .
LARA: You may have to move to another school district .
JOHN: Already spoke to a realtor .
LARA: How was your first day ?
JOHN: Excellent . Over half my class stayed awake . Talked to your mom .
LARA: When is she coming ?
JOHN: She 's having a lot of trouble with her business .
LARA: It 's only been a couple of years , I 'm sure she 'll get around to it . Have you heard anything ?
JOHN: About the appeal ? Yes , and I 'm just not telling you . What did Meye say ?
LARA: Do n't
JOHN: It can take months for the court to rule .
LARA: I saw that woman . She was there . She could n't have just disappeared .
JOHN: Meyer 's looking for a new investigator .
LARA: Her coat snagged my purse , I felt a utton pop - they must have been lind not to find it .
JOHN: He 'll go through all the evidence again .
LARA: Great , because I have n't quite ankrupted us yet .
JOHN: We 're doing fine .
LARA: You just lie and lie . But you are very handsome . Can you do me a favor ?
JOHN: I do n't know , I 'm a little busy .
LARA: I need you to run for governor .
JOHN: Oh , that I can do .
LARA: You can change this rule about no conjugal visits , because I do n't think I can last another twenty years .
JOHN: I know . But it 's going to be fine . I promise .
LARA: You think he 'll ever want to kiss me again ?
JOHN: Twenty-eight , twenty-nine , thirty .
PAULA: How 's Lara ?
JOHN: She 's doing okay .
PAULA: Tell her we 're pulling for her .
JOHN: I will . She holds up a plastic water bottle .
PAULA: They wo n't recycle these unless you take off the cap . This is trash . This is recyclable .
JOHN: Ok . Thanks .
NICOLE: Time to go , Carrie !
MEYER: John , I said my office at fou o'clock . I ca n't leave , I 'm in
JOHN: I figured you had to eat .
MEYER: Do you have the ruling in Brennan ?
JOHN: But what if we find the woman who was leaving the parking lot ?
MEYER: The PCRA was rejected . No new evidence can be submitted . Not anymore .
JOHN: It was a robbery ! Someone stole he purse !
MEYER: And if they 'd used her credit cards we would have had something to argue . I 'm sorry ; this reallysucks .
JOHN: So , that 's it . Now we just have the Supreme Court .
MEYER: John , in the last thirty years , the Supreme Court has n't heard one murde case . No decent lawyer would even file the pleadings .
JOHN: So , I need to find an indecent one ?
MEYER: No , I 'm going to file it . But I need you to do something for me .
JOHN: Anything .
MEYER: I need you to look at the evidence and just forget Lara is your wife .
JOHN: I 've seen the evidence , Meyer .
MEYER: I 'm not saying judge her innocent o guilty , I 'm just saying look at it . He co-worker sees her leaving the scene , she has the victim 's blood on her clothes , her fingerprints on the murder weapon
JOHN: We went out for dinner ! How do you do that after you kill somebody ? She would have to be a psychopath !
MEYER: And the fight in the office .
JOHN: Everyone fights with their boss !
MEYER: But this one ended up dead .
JOHN: So , you never believed she was innocent ?
MEYER: How can you say that ?
JOHN: So , what are you saying , Meyer ? !
MEYER: That it no longer matters what we elieve ; Lara 's not getting out . And you have no idea how much I hate saying that .
JOHN: I 'll find someone to file the pleadings .
MEYER: John ! Come on ! For Christ 's sake .
ERIT: I know you wo n't want to hear this
MICK: Erit , go put somebody to sleep .
JOHN: Thanks .
MICK: Had to be done . I am really going to pay for that . John has to smile .
JOHN: Lara Brennan ; my wife . She was sent up here . Brennan . B-R-
DUTY NURSE: She ca n't have visitors .
JOHN: That 's ridiculous ; I have to see her .
DUTY NURSE: I 'm sorry .
JOHN: Lara !
JOHN: Lara !
DR. BECSEY: What 's going on ? !
JOHN: My wife attempted suicide .
DR. BECSEY: Why is n't she in the ER ?
JOHN: Please . Two minutes .
DR. BECSEY: Two minutes .
JENNA: I 'm sorry . He just keeps pretending he 's asleep .
JOHN: Do n't worry about it .
JENNA: It 's okay .
JOHN: I insist . I kept you out on a school night .
JENNA: I 'm not in school anymore .
JOHN: And give a big hug to Pengui , Little Pengui , Big Turtley , Little Turtley , Kiki and Opossumy . Lots and lots of love , Mommy . You gon na give them hugs from her ? Should we write her back ?
LUKE: When is she coming home ?
JOHN: Soon honey . Soon .
LUKE: Can I have a quarter ?
JOHN: Can you have a quarter ?
LUKE: Then can I have them all ?
JOHN: Sure .
JOHN: So , what is it about ? Julie ?
JULIE: That belief in someone 's virtue is more important than virtue itself ?
JOHN: No . I mean , yes , that 's in there . But what is it about ? No takers .
JOHN: It 's a course that investigates what drives men to be free , no matter the cost .
DAMON: Somebody else had dibs on Papillon ?
JOHN: You escaped from jail seven times .
TOUGH GUY: No smoking ! !
DAMON: Yeah , who would want to cut short your precious life ? Damon takes a deep drag .
JOHN: Mind if I tape you ?
DAMON: Go for it , it ca n't be used as evidence . What do you want to know ? John sets up the small digital recorder .
JOHN: How you escaped when no one else could .
DAMON: Balls and a little luck . No prison in the world is airtight . Each one has a key . You have to find it .
JOHN: How do you do that ?
DAMON: A lot of looking . Especially at things that break the daily routine . Guards get comfortable doing the same thing every day . Something happens where they have to think , adapt .
JOHN: The city .
DAMON: Where are you from ?
JOHN: Pittsburgh .
DAMON: Pittsburgh is tough ; so many bridges and tunnels they can block off .
JOHN: How can they be so exact ?
DAMON: After 9-11 Homeland Security made every city have a lock-down plan downtown Pittsburgh , Philly , Boston , Minneapolis fifteen minutes . They can do DC in under ten .
JOHN: Thirty-five minutes is n't a lot of time .
DAMON: Then surrender .
DAMON: Forget the local airports . Leave from another state .
DAMON: Then money .
JOHN: How much ?
DAMON: Enough to last at least five-six years . Run out of money and you run out of friends .
JOHN: Yeah .
DAMON: What do you have in your pocket ?
LUKE: It was already tied .
WOMAN'S VOICE: Mr. Brennan ? Startled , John turns to see DR. LIFSON .
DR. LIFSON: We met briefly . Byrdie Lifson .
JOHN: Oh , sorry . Hello , Doctor .
DR. LIFSON: I 'll bring them back myself .
JOHN: I 'll talk to her .
DR. LIFSON: If she does n't
JOHN: I 'll talk to her . Let 's go , Squirrel .
LARA: I 'm fine . I 'm fine .
JOHN: The doctor told me about the insulin .
LARA: Yeah , I forgot . It 's no big deal .
JOHN: You forgot ? For how many days ?
LARA: I forgot , okay ? I have things on my mind .
JOHN: And so much to do .
LARA: Oh , that 's nice .
JOHN: Why are you doing this ?
LARA: Can I please just watch him play ? Tell me about kindergarten .
JOHN: No . I need you to
LARA: Fine , I wo n't forget again , okay ? I am just never going to walk him to school or wash his clothes or make him dinnerand I do n't know how I can live knowing that . Okay ?
JOHN: Lara . Look at me . Something will happen . I promise .
LARA: What ? What is going to happen ? There are no more appeals , there are no more anything . Exactly what miracle are we hoping for , John ?
JOHN: Sure .
LARA: Stop bringing him .
JOHN: Come on
LARA: He hates coming here . Look at him .
JOHN: Lara .
LARA: Please . It 's not his fault . It 's too hard to watch him forget me .
JOHN: Yes . Anything .
LARA: My mother tried to send me anti-aging cream .
EUGENIE: You 're sure that you do n't want a lawn sign ?
JOHN: I 'm very sure . Thanks .
COPTER PILOT: On the left , Allegheny County Jail . Built in 1995 , it is now the largest jail in the world . There have been three escape attempts . No one 's made it out alive . On your right
LYLA: On the first landing , which was as small as the necessary turn of the stairs allowed , there was a niche in the column , about a yard wide , and in this niche the prince felt convinced that a man stood concealed . He thought he could distinguish a figure standing there .
JOHN: Thanks .
MOUSS: Ten apiece , five for forty .
JOHN: I need some passports .
MOUSS: Piss off .

JOHN: It was stupid , I fell off the bike .
GRACE: The bike that 's been in our garage for two years ? Put your head back .
JOHN: Some guy made a crack about Lara .
GRACE: So , that 's what you do now punch everyone who thinks she 's guilty ?
JOHN: What 's that supposed to mean ?
GRACE: It means it 's important what YOU elieve , not
JOHN: Really ? So , what do you believe , Mom ? John stands and opens the back door .
GRACE: Why are you trying to start a fight ?
JOHN: Come on , buddy ! Where is his bag ?
GRACE: Why are you doing this ? ! Luke enters as Grace tries to hide her tears .
JOHN: No reason . I just stupidly thought people who loved her would actually elieve she 's innocent . My mistake .
GRACE: Stop this !
JOHN: Give Grandma a kiss .
LUKE: Does your face hurt ?
JOHN: A little .
LUKE: Did you hit him back ?
JOHN: No .
LUKE: That 's okay . John pulls away .

MIKE: I was at the bar . I know what you are looking for .

MIKE: Thirty seven hundred .
JOHN: That 's too much .
MIKE: It is if you never get them . I need photos and a thousand in advance .
JOHN: Not here . Do n't come here again . Mike stares at him . John stares back .
MIKE: Parking lot of Don 's . Eckert Street . Under the bridge ; two o'clock . If I 'm not there on time , leave .
JOHN: Show me how to load it .
JOHN: I 'll play checkers with you afte dinner .
NOTARY: Mr. Brennan ?

JOHN: Hi .
PAULA: I was wondering if I could ask you to water my plants next week ; I 'm going in for an operation .

MIKE: The one with the red light in his ack window .
JOHN: How are you doing today ?
GUARD: Do n't touch that .
JOHN: Sorry .
MAJOR: So , you are where in here ?
JOHN: In the middle there .
MAJOR: In the middle . Can you point to yourself ?
JOHN: It 's hard to tell . I think that 's me there . Why ?
MAJOR: So that 's not you there . By the elevator ?
JOHN: .No . I was over here . You want to tell me what 's going on ?
MAJOR: You want me to tell you ?
JOHN: Yes .
MAJOR: You know what a bump key is ?
JOHN: Sorry .
MAJOR: If this was you , you might want to think about what 's going to happen to your kids if both of their parents are in prison . The major stares right through him .
DETECTIVE COLLERO: The worst date you 've ever been on ? This was worse . And this guy ? He really thinks he is doing great . Then he 's driving me home and I know he 's going to try and kiss me , so I pretend to fall asleep . I mean , I 'm actually snoring , right in his car . Does that stop him ?
DETECTIVE QUINN: Did I tell you not to date cops ?

NICOLE: Wow . I guess that 's why I see you so much .
JOHN: She 'd like nothing better than to be here . With him . Lara . She really missesall this .

LARA: Is it Luke ?
JOHN: No . He 's fine . I had Meyer see what he could do about not getting you moved .
LARA: You have n't ? YOU have n't ? God , John , you are too much . Luke is having a 'hard time ' because mommy is in jail for murder , not because daddy does n't spend enough time with him ! Your father was right , you do n't live in the same world we do .
JOHN: That 's nice , that the two of you talk . What world do I live in , Lara ?
LARA: I do n't know , but it 's not the real one . I am in here for the rest of my life ! And you want me to believe in some fantasy that !

MS. JONES: What we have here is what they call a Mexican standoff . The thing you got ta ask yourself is , `` What 's behind the seat ? '' Now , a twenty-two 'd go ight through it , but even a button will throw a twenty-two off so there 's a good chance it 'd get screwed up somewhere along the way , miss the target . Maybe a thirty-eight ? A thirty-eight'11 drill pretty straight , unless it hits metal , then it 'll ust up in little bitty pieces . They 'll keep going but they 'll be slowed down quite a bit . How 's about a three-fifty-seven ? It 'll go through the seat , her , you , the dashboard , shit , it 'll go through the engine lock before it knows it 's hit anything , end up in some pedestrian three blocks away . What do you think ? What 's my poison ?
MR. SMITH: I 've got him in the crosshairs .
GENE: Pool Deck ?
HECTOR: Fourth Floor . Take that escalator .

OFFICER TRUST: So do you , Mr. Watson .

OFFICER TRUST: It does n't look like it .

GENE: No ! You ca n't ! They 're in on it .
KRISTA: I do n't see how they could be in on it . They 're the best . They 're hand- picked .

GENE: You 've got to trust me . I 'm putting my daughter 's life in your hands . She 's only six . She 's just a little girl . Please , please , trust me .
KRISTA: It 's a little hard to trust you unde the circumstances . GENE looks at her intently .
GENE: You 're right , it is . Here .
KRISTA: I guess I 'll have to . Come on , there 's one person we can go to .
GENE: The man following me has a walkie- talkie . If he sees I 'm not here he 'll call his partner . I do anything out of line and he 'll send the word to kill my daughter .
KRISTA: He 'll think you 're in the crowd until the end of the speech . Wait a minute .
GENE: Are you sure ?
KRISTA: I 've heard this speech a lot . Come on . We 'll take care of him . We will .
GENE: But
KRISTA: Trust me . You asked me for help . Let me help . Trust me .
GENE: Okay She starts to lead him away .
KRISTA: I think you 're right .
ELEANOR GRANT: But tragedy , if it does n't destroy us , has a curious way of giving us strength .
GENE: Where are we going ?
HALL GUARD: Ms. Brooks
KRISTA: Is he in ?
HALL GUARD: Yes , ma'am .
GENE: Who is this ? Are you sure we can trust him ?
KRISTA: I 'm sure . It 's her husband . He 's he Campaign Manager .
BRENDAN GRANT: What is it ? Is there a problem ?
KRISTA: We need to see you , Brendan . She grabs GENE and pushes inside .
GENE: We have to hurry .
KRISTA: I know . Brendan , listen to me . Someone is trying to kill Eleanor .
BRENDAN GRANT: What ? What are you talking about ?
KRISTA: We need people we can `` trust . We only have a few moments
BRENDAN GRANT: This isthis is insane . How do you know this ?
GENE: I know it because I 'm the one who 's supposed to kill her .
BRENDAN GRANT: You are ! ? You brought this man here ! ? You ought this man to my room ! ?
KRISTA: I had to . Her Security people may be involved
MYSTERY MAN: Is there a problem , Brendan ?
BRENDAN GRANT: There certainly is . This man says he 's been hired to kill Eleanor .
GENE: Not hired . They 're blackmailing me .
MYSTERY MAN: Who is this `` they '' ?
GENE: I don'tI do n't know . Please , Mr. Grant ! They have my daughter . I 'm not some lunatic . Your wife is in trouble . Someone is trying to kill her . Someone is trying to make me kill her . Please , listen
MYSTERY MAN: And on the strength of this story , you bring this man to Brendan 's suite ? Does that show good judgment , Ms. Brooks ? I 'm just a friend of Brendan 's , but it seems to me
KRISTA: He brought a gun onto the pool deck .
MYSTERY MAN: What ?
KRISTA: He got onto the pool deck with a gun . How did he get past her Security carrying a
MYSTERY MAN: I see . Where is this gun ?
KRISTA I: Have it .
MYSTERY MAN: Well , is it real ? Do we know anything about it ?
KRISTA: It looks real . I do n't know anything about guns .
MYSTERY MAN: Could I see it ?
BRENDAN GRANT: Jesus Christ !
MR. SMITH: ( calmly , staring at
GENE: Yeah , I 'd say it 's real .
MYSTERY MAN: Are you out of your fucking mind ! ?
OFFICER TRUST: Somebody mind telling me ) What the hell happened ! ?
MR. SMITH: Help me get her off the rug .
BRENDAN GRANT: What have you done to me ! ? Christ almighty !
GENE: No !
MR. SMITH: You fucked up .
MYSTERY MAN: Do n't let him go !
GENE: I killed you .
MR. SMITH: You fucked up .
BRENDAN GRANT: I 'm on record . I never wanted this . I wanted simplicity ; a telescopic sight , a powerful rifle , but no . What was good enough for Oswald was n't good enough for you two . You had to get fancy . Drag some shmuck in off the street , stick a gun in his hand .
MYSTERY MAN: It 's academic now . She had to be killed .
MR. SMITH: What were you going to do , Brendan ? Lock her in a closet ? You 're in the fucking kitchen now . Get used to the heat . He 's been seen all over the hotel , looking like some Loony Tunes . We even got him on video . It 'll work . Do n't worry about it . GENE stirs on the floor .
MYSTERY MAN: Is he awake ?
MR. SMITH: Yeah . He yanks GENE to his feet .
BRENDAN GRANT: Oh Great . Why do n't we just give him our home phone numbers while we 're at it ?
MR. SMITH: It does n't matter what he hears .
MYSTERY MAN: Get going . You 've only got a few minutes to pull it together .
BRENDAN GRANT: There is a dead woman on my bathroom floor !
MYSTERY MAM: What about it ? She 's Eleanor 's assistant and they will have been shot with the same gun , by the same lunatic . Some , anonymous loser who went over the edge .
BRENDAN GRANT: Only thing better would be if he were a postal worker .
OFFICER TRUST: He wo n't be doing any work once I get through with him .
MYSTERY MAN: And in a few months you 're in the Governor 's mansion . The people 'd make you king of California if they could .
GENE: I 'm not stupid.. I know how this is supposed , to work .
MR. SMITH: Do you now , Mr. Watson ?
GENE: I kill her - and you kill me .
MR. SMITH: Keep your voice down .
GENE: Even if you do n't , Her Security men will .
MR. SMITH: That 's not my problem , Mr. Watson He gets out the walkie-talkie , keys it .
GENE: How do I know you wo n't kill my daughter once I 'm gone ?
MR. SMITH: Come Back.Fucking Radio .
MR.SMITH: I told you she 'd be alright , if you do your job .
GENE: And I 'm supposed to trust you ?

I can not tell There 's so many things I can not grasp When I think I 've got it , and then at last Through my bony fingers it does slip Like a snowflake in a fiery grip Something here I 'm not quite getting Though I try , I keep forgetting Like a memory long since past Here in an instant , gone in a flash What does it mean ? What does it mean ? In these little bric-a-brac A secret 's waiting to be cracked These dolls and toys confuse me so Confound it all , I love it though Simple objects , nothing more But something 's hidden through a doo Though I do not have the key Something 's there I can not see What does it mean ? What does it mean ? What does it mean ? Hmm I 've read these Christmas books so many times I know the stories and I know the rhymes I know the Christmas carols all by heart My skull 's so full , it 's tearing me apart As often as I 've read them , something 's wrong So hard to put my bony finger on Or perhaps it 's really not as deep As I 've been led to think Am I trying much too hard ? Of course ! I 've been too close to see The answer 's right in front of me Right in front of me It 's simple really , very clea Like music drifting in the ai Invisible , but everywhere Just because I can not see it Does n't mean I ca n't believe it

DR. FINKELSTEIN: Careful , my precious jewel !
JACK: My dearest friend , if you do n't mind I 'd like to join you by your side Where we can gaze into the stars
TINA: Just a dream , Ma Damn dream , is all
TINA'S MOTHER: Some dream , judging from that . She nods at TINA 's nightshift .
TINA: Oh , shit .
ROPE JUMPERS: Seven eight , gon na stay up late ! Nine ten never sleep again !
TINA: That 's what it reminded me of that old jump rope song . Worst nightmare I ever had . You would n't believe it . Nancy nods .
NANCY: Matter of fact I had a bad dream last night myself
ROD: Had a hardon this morning when I woke up , Tina . Had your name written all over it .
TINA: There 's four letters in my name , Rod . How could there be room on your joint for four letters ? The guy 's stopped in his tracks .
ROD: Hey , up yours with a twirling lawn mower ! He cuts off across the lawn .
TINA: Rod says the sweetest things .
NANCY: He 's nuts about you .
TINA: Yeah , nuts .
NANCY: Forget it , the point is , every- ody has nightmares once in a while . No biggy .
GLEN: Next time you have one , just tell yourself that 's just all it is , right while you 're having it , y'know ? That 's the trick . Once you do that , you wake right up . At least it works for me .
TINA: Hey ! You have a nightmare too ? But GLEN 's gone .
NANCY: Right . Well , she did n't , exactly
GLEN: See , I got this cousin who lives near the airport , that it 's okay for me to stay with , right ? So I found this sound effects tape at Licorice Pizza , and
NANCY: Worked like a charm .
GLEN: Jesus .
NANCY: Nice to have a fire .
TINA: Really . Turn 'er up a little .
NANCY: Maybe we should call Rod , have him come over too . He might get jealous .
TINA: Rod and I are done . He 's too much of a maniac .
GLEN: He should join the Marines , they could make something out of him . Like a hand grenade .
NANCY: See ? You 've forgotten the bad dream . Did n't I tell you ?
TINA: All day long I been seeing that guy 's weird face , and hearing those fingernails NANCY looks up with a flinch .
NANCY: Fingernails ? That 's amazing , you saying that . It made me remember the dream I had last night . TINA looks up .
TINA: What you dream ?
NANCY: I dreamed about this guy in a dirty red and yellow sweater ; I dream in color , y'know ; he walked into the room I was in , ight , right through the wall , like it was smoke or something , and just stared at me . Sort of obscenely . Then he walked out through the wall on the other side . Like he 'd just come to check me out
TINA: So what about the fingernails ?
NANCY: He scraped his fingernails along things actually , they were more like fingerknives o something , like he 'd made them himself ? Anyway , they made this horrible nose u > sssssccrrrtttt . TINA pales .
TINA: Nancy . You dreamed about the same creep I did , Nancy The girls stare at each other .
GLEN: That 's impossible .
TINA: What ?
GLEN: Nothing .
TINA: There 's somebody out there , u > is n't there
NANCY: I did n't hear anything
GLEN: I 'm gon na punch out your ugly lights , whoever you are .
NANCY: Then bring us back its tail and whiskers .
TINA: Anyway , I do n't have a cat
GLEN: Kitty-kitty ? Chow chow chow ?
ROD: And it 's number thirty-six , Rod Lane , bringing Lantz down just three yards from the goal with a illiant tackle ! And the fans go wild !
TINA: What the hell you doing here ?
ROD: Came to make up , no big deal . Your ma home ?
TINA: Of course . What 's that ?
ROD: Intense , huh ? So what 's happening , an orgy o something ?
GLEN: Maybe a funeral , you dickhead .
NANCY: Just a sleep-over date , Rod . Just Tina and me . Glen was just leaving .
ROD: You see his face ? Your ma ai n't home , is she ? Me and Tina got stuff to discuss .
NANCY: Rod
ROD: We got her mother 's bed . You two got the rest .
NANCY: We should get her out of here
TINA: Hey you guys 're hanging around ight ? Do n't leave me alone with this lunatic Pleeeeze , NANCY !
GLEN: So we 'll guard her together . Through the night . In each others ' arms like we always said .
NANCY: Glen . Not now . I mean , we 're here for Tina now , not for ourselves . She kisses him lightly , then pushes him back .
GLEN: Why 's she so bothered by a stupid nightmare , anyway ?
NANCY: Because he was scary , that 's why .
GLEN: Who was scary ? NANCY turns and looks at him .
NANCY: Do n't you think it 's weird , he and me dreaming about the same guy ? You did n't have a bad dream last night , did you ? GLEN gives her a funny look .
GLEN: Me ? I do n't dream .
TINA: I knew there was sometihng about you I liked ROD yawns into the pillows , happy .

NANCY: Yeah . Something slippering all over here Tina ?
GLEN: Oh , shit
PARKER: Lieutenant Thompson . Sorry to wake you , but
LT THOMPSON: I'd 've canned your ass if you had n't . What you got ?
PARKER: Her name was Tina Gray . It was her home . Father abandoned ten years ago , mother 's in Vegas with a boyfriend . We 're trying to reach her now .
LT THOMPSON: What 's the Coroner got to say ?
PARKER: Something like a razor was the weapon , but nothing found on the scene .
SERGEANT GARCIA: Leautenant . You know who
LT THOMPSON: Where is she ?
SERGEANT GARCIA: I put her in your office PARKER scurries after .
PARKER: Looks like her boyfriend did it . Rod Lane . Musician type , arrests for brawling , dope
LT THOMPSON: Terrific . What the hell was she doing there ?
PARKER: She lived there .
MARGE: Hello to you , too , Donald .
LT THOMPSON: Marge .
NANCY: Okay . Hi , dad .
LT THOMPSON: I do n't want to get into this now , god knows you need time . But I 'd sure would like to know what the hell you were doing shacked up with three other kids in the middle of the night especially a delinquent lunatic like Lane . NANCY weaves .
NANCY: Rod 's not a lunatic .
LT THOMPSON: You got a sane explanation fo what he did ? The girl is shredding a Kleenex , staring off .
MARGE: Apparantly he was crazy jealous . Nancy said they 'd had a fight , Rod and Tina .
NANCY: It was n't that serious
MARGE: Maybe you do n't think murder 's serious
NANCY: She was my best friend ! Do n't you dare say I do n't take he death seriously ! I just meant their fights were n't that serious .
LT THOMPSON: What ?
NANCY: She had a nightmare about somebody trying to kill her , last night . That 's why we were there ; she was afraid to sleep alone . A tear splashes off the arm of her chair .
MARGE: She 's been through enough for one night . You have her statement .
LT THOMPSON: I suggest you keep a little bette track on her she 's still a kid , y'know . MARGE wheels on him .
MARGE: You think I knew there were boys there ! ? You try raising a teenager alone .
LT THOMPSON: See they get home okay .
MARGE: Where you think you 're going ?
NANCY: School .
MARGE: I could hear you tossing and turning all night , kiddo . You 've no business going to school . NANCY pulls away , determined .
NANCY: I got ta go to school , Mom . Please . Otherwise I 'll just sit up there and go crazy or something . MARGE studies her face a moment .
MARGE: Did you sleep ?
NANCY: I 'll sleep in study hall , promise . I 'd rather keep busy , you know ?
MARGE: Right home after . NANCY Right home after . See you .
ROD: I 'm not gon na hurt you .
NANCY: He does n't know you . Could n't you change ?
ROD: The cops were all over my house . They 'll kill me for sure .
NANCY: Nobody 's gon na kill you .
ROD: I never touched her .
NANCY: You were screaming like crazy .
ROD: Someone else was there .
NANCY: The door was locked from you side .
ROD: Do n't look at me like I 'm some kind of fucking fruitcake o something , I 'm warning you .
LT THOMPSON: Now just step away from her , son . Like your ass depended on it . I 'm warning you .
NANCY: No ! THOMPSON jerks his gun into the air , furious .
THOMPSON: Jesus are you crazy ! ? He plunges past the girl .
NANCY: You used me , daddy !
LT THOMPSON: What the hell you doing going to school today , anyway you mother told me you did n't even sleep last night ! NANCY spins angrily and walks away .
TEACHER: According to Shakespeare , there was something operating in Nature , perhaps inside human nature itself , that was rotten a canker , as he put it .
SURFER: Uh , In the most high and palmy state of Rome
ENGLISH TEACHER: Can it .
SURFER: O God , I could be bounded in a nutshell and count myself a king of infinite space , were it not that I have bad dreams
NANCY: Tina ! NANCY starts running for it .
HALLGUARD: Y-you 're not supposed to run . W-where 's your pass you got a pass ? NANCY leaps up
NANCY: Screw your stupid pass !
HALLGUARD: Hey , no running in the halls !
NANCY: Tina ? No answer . NANCY starts down the stairs .
MAN: Gon na get you .
TEACHER: Okay Okay , Thompson ! Every- thing 's all right now Nancy ! .
NANCY: No ! No , really , I 'm fine . I 'll go straight home . I 'm okay . She marches for the door .
TEACHER: You 'll need a hall pass ! But the girl 's gone .
TINA: Could n't get back to sleep at all . What you dream ?
NANCY: My dad here ? GARCIA looks up from his paperwork .
SERGEANT GARCIA: Lieutenant .
LT THOMPSON: Decide to take a day off afte all ?
NANCY: Dad , I want to see Rod Lane . THOMPSON does n't miss a beat .
LT THOMPSON: Only family allowed , Nancy . You know the drill .
NANCY: Just want to talk to him a second .
LT THOMPSON: He 's dangerous .
NANCY: You do n't know he did it .
LT THOMPSON: No , I know , thanks to you own testimony , that he was locked in a room with a girl who went in alive and came out in a rubber bag .
NANCY: I just want to talk to him . Please , Dad .
LT THOMPSON: Make it fast .
NANCY: And then what happened ?
ROD: I told you . It was dark , but I 'm sure there was someone else IN there , unde the covers with her . NANCY reacts .
NANCY: How could somebody get unde the covers with you guys without you knowing it ?
ROD: How the fuck do I know ? I do n't expect you to believe me .
NANCY: What he look like ? You get a look at him ? He looks away .
ROD: No .
NANCY: Well then how can you say somebody else was there ?
ROD: Because somebody cut her . While I watched .
NANCY: Somebody cut her while you watched and you do n't know what he looked like ?
ROD: You could n't see the fucker . You could just see the cuts happening , all at once . NANCY gives a twitch .
NANCY: What you mean 'all at once ' ?
ROD: I mean , it was as if there were four razors cutting her at the same time . But invisible razors . She just opened up
NANCY: Rod !
ROD: I probably could 've saved he if I 'd moved sooner But I thought it was just anothe nightmare , like the one I had the night before . There was this guy who had knives for fingers
NANCY: No .
MARGE: Nancy , do n't fall asleep in there .
NANCY: I will .
MARGE: Nancy ! NANCY !
NANCY: Mommy !
MARGE: I told you ! Hundreds of people a year drown like that !
NANCY: Great
MARGE: To bed with you , c'mon .
NANCY: No , Mother . Yes , Mother . No , Mother .
MARGE: And no school tomorrow , either . you take a little vacation , relax and rest for a change .
NANCY: Yes , Mother . G'night .
MARGE: Take this , it 'll help you sleep .
NANCY: Right .
MARGE: Sleep tight , do n't let the edbugs bite .
GLEN: Sorry ! Saw your light on . Thought I 'd see how you were . She gets herself together , barely .
NANCY: Sometimes I wish you did n't live ight across the street .
GLEN: Shut up and let me in . You eve stand on a rose trellis in you are feet ?
NANCY: If you do n't mind . GLEN crosses to the chair and plops down .
GLEN: So . I heard you freaked out in English class today .
NANCY: Guess I did .
GLEN: Have n't slept , have you ?
NANCY: Not really .
GLEN: You look dead and rained on , if you want the ugly truth . And what you do to your arm ? She shrugs , trying to keep it casual .
NANCY: Burned myself in Englsh class .
GLEN: Slept like a rock .
NANCY: Well at least I have an objective wall to bounce this off . You believe it 's possible to dream about what 's going to happen ?
GLEN: No .
NANCY: You believe in the Boogey Man ?
GLEN: One two , Freddie 's coming for you ? No . Rod killed Tina . he 's a fruitcake and you know it .
NANCY: You believe in anything ?
GLEN: I believe in you , me , and Rock and Roll . And I 'm not too sure about you lately . NANCY thinks .
NANCY: Listen , I got a crazy favo to ask .
GLEN: Uh-oh
NANCY: It 's nothing too hard or anything . I 'm just going to LOOK for someone , and I want you to be sort of a guard . Okay ? GLEN makes the Twilight Zone sound .
GLEN: Okay , okay . I think . She comes very close to him .
NANCY: You wo n't screw up , right ? I mean , a whole lot might depend on it .
GLEN: Okay , I wo n't screw up .
NANCY: Shhh . Now listen , here 's what we 're gon na do
GLEN: Yeah . So ?
NANCY: Just checking keep out of sight !
GLEN: What I do ?
NANCY: I asked you to do just one thing . Just stay awake and watch me Just wake me if it looked like I was having a bad dream . But you . You shit what do you do you fall asleep !
GLEN: Oh , shit . NANCY composes her voice as best she can .
NANCY: Yes , mother ?
MARGE: You okay ?
NANCY: Yeah . Just had a little dream . I 'm falling right back to sleep .
MARGE: Okay You need anything , just call .
NANCY: Okay .
GLEN: You mind telling me what 's going on ?
NANCY: Garcia , I want to see Rod Lane again . GARCIA winces .
SGT GARCIA: I thought when I took the night shift I 'd have peace and quiet for a change .
NANCY: It 's urgent , we 've got ta see Rod .
SGT GARCIA: It 's three in the morning . Your mother know you 're out this late ?
NANCY: Of course look , at least go ack and look at him . Just see if he 's okay . GARCIA glances at GLEN .
GLEN: We have reason to think there might be something weird going on .
NANCY: Dad what you doing here ?
LT THOMPSON: It so happens I work here , and there 's an unsolved murder . I do n't like unsolved murders , especially ones my daughter 's mixed up in what are you < /u doing here at this hour ? You 're supposed to be getting some sleep .
GLEN: Listen , sir , this is serious . Nancy had a nightmare about Rod eing in danger , or something , and so she thinks
NANCY: I just want to see if he 's okay !
SGT GARCIA: Take my word for it , Nancy . The guy 's sleeping like a baby . He 's not going anywhere .
NANCY: This is n't your average nightmare , Daddy damn it !
LT THOMPSON: Now look , Nancy , do n't push it . You 've already rubbed my nose in sex , drugs and violence do n't start throwing in insanity !
NANCY: Just go back and check please !
LT THOMPSON: Okay , Garcia . What the hell .
SGT GARCIA: Right Now where 'd I put the key
NANCY: Rod !
LT THOMPSON: Gim me a hand , dammit !
SGT GARCIA: Goddamn loco kid he did n't have t'do that Madre dios !
LT THOMPSON: How 'd you know he was gon na do this ? NANCY says nothing .
MINISTER: Ashes to ashes , dust to dust . May God be with this young man 's soul .
NANCY: Amen to that much .
LT THOMPSON: How 's Nancy doing ?
MARGE: I do n't think she 's slept since Tina died . She 's always been a delicate kid .
LT THOMPSON: She 's tougher than you think . Any idea how she knew Rod was gon na kill himself ?
MARGE: No . All I know is , this reminds me too much of ten years ago .
LT THOMPSON: Yeah . Well Let 's not start digging up bodies just because we 're in a cemetery .
MARGE: Time to go home , baby .
NANCY: The killer 's still loose , you know .
LT THOMPSON: You saying somebody else killed Tina ? Who ? NANCY smiles a weird sort of smile .
NANCY: I do n't know who he is . But he 's urned , he wears a weird hat , a ed and yellow sweater , real dirty , and he uses some sort of knifes he 's got made into a sort of glove . Like giant finger- nails .
LT THOMPSON: I think you should keep Nancy at home a few days . 'Til she 's eally over the shock .
MARGE: I got something better I 'm gon na get you help , baby . So no one will threaten you any more .
NANCY: But I just do n't feel ready < /u to sleep yet . Please , do I have to ?
DR KING: Do n't worry , you 're not gon na change into Bride of Frankenstein or anything .
MARGE: No , nothing .
NANCY: He means , did you ever drop me on my head .
DR KING: Nightmares are expected afte psychological trauma . Do n't worry , they go away .
MARGE: I sure as hell hope so .
NANCY: I do n't see why you could n't just give me a pill to keep me from dreaming
DR KING: Everyone 's got to dream . If you do n't dream , you go All set ?
NANCY: No .
MARGE: They 're just simple tests , Nan . We 'll both be right here .
DR KING: Look , I know it 's been fright- ening , I know your dreams have seemed real . But it 's okay . Okay ?
MARGE: Please , Nancy . Trust us .
NANCY: It 's not you I do n't trust . It 's Okay . Let 's do it .
DR KING: How long 's this been going on ?
MARGE: Since the murder . She was fine efore that .
DR KING: Not to worry . No signs of path- ology in Nancy 's EEG or pulse ate . I 'd guess what we 've got is a normal young girl who just happens to have gone through two days of hell .
MARGE: It 's just made her think her dreams are real
DR KING: Ever hear the old Buddhist tale about the King who dreamed he was a beggar who dreamed he was a king ?
MARGE: Thank God .
MARGE: What the hell are dreams , anyway ?
DR KING: Mysteries . Incredible body hookus pokus . Truth is we still do n't know what they are or where they come from . As for nightmares Did you know that in the last three years twenty Philipino efugees in California died in the middle of nightmares ? Not from heart attacks , either . They just died .
MARGE: What happened ? That needle sank like a rock .
DR KING: She 's entering deep sleep now . Heart rate 's a little high due to anxiety , but otherwise she 's nicely relaxed . All normal . She could dream at any time now . Right now she 's like a dive on the bottom of an ocean no one 's mapped yet . Waiting to see what shows up .
MARGE: How can you tell ?
DR KING: R.E.M. 's . Rapid eye movements . The eyes follow the dream their movement picks up on this
MARGE: What the hell 's this ? She awake or asleep ?
DR KING: Ca n't be . It never gets this high The needle swings even higher , benind .
DR KING: Now , this is just going to let you relax and sleep , Nan
NANCY: No . That 's enough sleep .
DR KING: Okay , kid . Okay . Fair enough .
MARGE: Oh my god , oh my god
DR KING: Get the kit !
NANCY: You believe this ?
MARGE: Where the hell did you get that ? NANCY fixes her with Xray eyes .
NANCY: I grabbed it off his head .
MARGE: She said she snatched it off his head in a dream . No , I 'm not crazy , I 've got the damn thing in my hand ! I know we did , we all Got ta go .
NANCY: Go even crazier ?
MARGE: I do n't think you 're going crazy and stop drinking that damn coffee !
NANCY: Did you ask Daddy to have the hat examined ?
MARGE: I threw that filthy thing away I do n't know what you 're trying to prove with it , but
NANCY: What I learned at the dream clinic , that 's what I 'm trying to prove . Rod did n't kill Tina , and he did n't hang himself . It 's this guy he 's afte us in our dreams .
MARGE: But that 's just not reality , Nancy !
NANCY: It 's real , Mamma . Feel it .
MARGE: Put that damned thing down !
NANCY: His name is even in it written ight in here Fred Krueger Fred Krueger ! You know who that is , Mamma ? You better tell me , cause now he 's after me ! MARGE swallows , then persists in the lie .
MARGE: Nancy , trust your mother fo once you 'll feel better as soon as you sleep !
NANCY: You call this feeling better ? Or should I grab a bottle and veg out with you avoid everything happening to me y just getting good and loaded MARGE slaps her hard .
MARGE: Fred Krueger ca n't be after you , Nancy he 's dead !
NANCY: You knew about him all this time , and you 've been acting like he was someone I made up ! MARGE pulls away .
MARGE: You 're sick , Nancy . Imagining things . You need to sleep , it 's as simple as that .
NANCY: Screw sleep !
GLEN: Whenever I get nervous I eat .
NANCY: And if you ca n't do that , you sleep .
GLEN: Used to . Not anymore .
NANCY: No .
GLEN: They got a whole system they call 'dream skills ' . So , if you have a nightmare , fo instance like falling , right ?
NANCY: Yeah .
GLEN: Instead of screaming and getting nuts , you say , okay , I 'm gon na make up my mind that I fall into a magic world where I can get something special , like a poem or song . They get all their art literature from dreams . Just wake up and write it down . Dreamskills .
NANCY: And what if they meet a monste in their dream ? Then what ?
GLEN: They turn their back on it . Takes away its energy , and it disappears .
NANCY: What happens if they do n't do that ?
GLEN: I guess those people do n't wake up to tell what happens .
NANCY: Great .
GLEN: 'Booby Traps and Improvised Anti-personel Devices ' !
NANCY: I found it at this neat survivalist bookstore on Ventura .
GLEN: Well what you reading it for ?
NANCY: I 'm into survival .
GLEN: She 's starting to scare the living shit out of me .
FOREMAN: And the other
MARGE: Where 's your mask and gun ? The FOREMAN counts the money swiftly .
FOREMAN: Do n't bust my chops , lady . If the city found out I put 'em in without inside releases I 'd loose my license .
NANCY: Oh gross
MARGE: 'S'mine She rocks the bottle in her arms .
NANCY: What 's with the bars ?
MARGE: S'curity .
NANCY: Mom , I want to know what you know about Fred Krueger .
MARGE: Dead and gone .
NANCY: I want to know how , where if you do n't tell me , I 'm going to call daddy .
MARGE: All right .
NANCY: So he 's alive ? MARGE smiles grimly .
MARGE: He wouldn 've stopped . The astard would 've got more kids first chance he got they found nearly ten bodies in his boiler room as it was . But the law could n't touch him .
NANCY: What did you do , mother ? MARGE cradles the bottle .
MARGE: Bunch of us parents tracked him down after they let him go . Found him in an old boiler room , just like before . Saw him lying there in that caked red and yellow sweate he always wore , drunk an ' asleep with his weird knives by his side
NANCY: Go on
MARGE: We poured gasoline all around the place , left a trail out the door , locked the door , then She mimes striking a match
NANCY: Who was there ? Were Tina 's parents there ? Were Rod 's ? MARGE sags back .
MARGE: Sure , and Glen 's . All of us . But that 's in the past now , aby . Really . It 's over . We even took his knives .
NANCY: All these years you 've kept those things buried down here ? In ou own house ?
GLEN: Hello ? NANCY Hi .
NANCY: Coming up on the seventh day . It 's okay , I checked Guiness . The ecord 's eleven , and I 'll beat that if I have to . Listen , I I know who he is .
GLEN: Who ?
NANCY: The killer .
GLEN: You do ?
NANCY: Yeah , and if he gets me , I 'm pretty sure you 're next . GLEN is appalled .
GLEN: Me ! ? Why would anyone want to kill me ? !
NANCY: Do n't ask just give me some help nailing this guy when I ing him out . GLEN pales .
GLEN: Bring him out of what ?
NANCY: My dream .
GLEN: How you plan to do that ?
NANCY: Just like I did the hat . Have a hold of the sucker when you wake me up .
GLEN: Me ? Wait a minute , you ca n't bring someone out of a dream !
NANCY: If I ca n't , then you all can elax , because it 'll just be a simple case of me being nuts .
GLEN: I can save you the trouble . You 're nutty as a fruitcake . I love you anyway .
NANCY: Good , then you wo n't mind cold-cocking this guy when I bring him out .
GLEN: What ! ?
NANCY: You heard me . I grab him in the dream you see me struggling so you wake me up . We both come out , you cold cock the fucker , and we got him . Clever , huh ?
GLEN: You crazy ? Hit him with what ?
NANCY: You 're a jock . You must have a baseball bat or something . Come to my window at midnight . And meanwhile
GLEN: Meanwhile.. ?
NANCY: Meanwhile whatever you do do n't fall asleep . Midnight . She hangs up . GLEN 's eyes bug out .
GLEN: Holy shit ! Midnight . Baseball ats and boogemen . Unfucking eal .
LT THOMPSON: Ca n't sleep , thought I 'd come eak up the poker game .
SERGEANT GARCIA: If it was any more quiet we could hear owls farting .
LT THOMPSON: Is quiet , is n't it ?
SERGEANT GARCIA: How 's your girl ?
LT THOMPSON: She 's sensible . She 'll sleep sooner or later .
MR LANTZ: You 'd think they 'd have some- < /u thing 'bout the Lane kid hanging himself .
MRS LANTZ: Maybe we 're all making more out of it than we should .
GLEN: Whuu ?
MRS LANTZ: How can you listen to Carson and a record at the same time ?
GLEN: Was n't listening to the tube , just watching . Miss Nude America 's supposed to be on tonight .
MRS LANTZ: Well how you gon na hear what she says ?
GLEN: Who cares what she says ? The mother gives up .
MRS LANTZ: You should get to sleep soon , Glen . It 's almost midnight . Goodness knows we 've all had enough of a time the last few days
GLEN: I will , Momin a while . You guys turning in ?
MRS LANTZ: Pretty soon .
MARGE: We 'll go away , take a vacation . Get your hair colored nice , the way it was . No one will eve know . This whole room smells of coffee , y'know ?
NANCY: Okay .
MRS LANTZ: Should n't stare .
MR LANTZ: Know what I think ? I think that kid 's some kinda lunatic .
MRS LANTZ: Should n't say such a thing about the poor child . If you mean the ars , Marge 's just being cautious , her being alone and Nancy acting so nervous lately .
NANCY: Hang on GLEN
GLEN: Well , I 'm not gon na risk sneaking out until she does . He puts the earphones back on .
MR LANTZ: Who at this hour ?
MRS LANTZ: Hello ? Oh Hold on . It 's her . She wants to talk to Glen .

LT THOMPSON: Where 'd you hear about Krueger NANCY presses , very firm , very rational .
NANCY: I want you to come over here and break the door down exactly twenty minutes from now can you do that ?
LT THOMPSON: Sure , but
NANCY: That 'll be exactly half past midnight . Time for me to fall asleep and find him .

MR LANTZ: He done it . THOMPSON looks at the man , baffled .
LT THOMPSON: Who ? Who did that ?
MR LANTZ: Krueger .
LT THOMPSON: Krueger ? The father gives him the strangest look .
MR LANTZ: Had to 've done it . No one else was in there .
LT THOMPSON: How you know that ?

KAREN: Then come help me unpack .
JACOB: It 's incredible . Best I 've ever had .
KAREN: You 're not from around here , are you ?
JACOB: No . I 've been on the road for a couple of days .
KAREN: Do you need a place to stay ?
MARY: So , we have to get it fixed .
DAVID: We do n't have the money to get it fixed .
KAREN: What 's wrong ?
DAVID: Our plumbing has a bad case of hardening of the arteries . Who 's your friend ?
KAREN: This is Jacob .
JACOB: Jacob Johnson .
DAVID: David Ross . My wife , Mary .
KAREN: They run this house . They 're helping me and three other ids get a footing in eality before they kick us out of the nest to make room for the next batch .
DAVID: If there is a next batch . I see the welcome wagon is back . Was there any trouble ?
KAREN: A little . Jacob came to my rescue .
MARY: Where you from , Jacob ?
JACOB: Springwood .
MARY: Springwood ? Where 's that ?
JACOB: Upstate about a hundred miles .
DAVID: I know this state like the back of my hand . I 've never heard of Springwood .
KAREN: Jacob 's a little down on his luck . I told him he could stay here a few days . Jacob gives here a surprised look .
MARY: Are your parents in Springwood ?

DAVID: Okay . You got three , maybe four days to est up while we try and find a more permanent arrangement for you . But his is n't going to be a free ride . We 're part of a community summer work project and eighty percent of the money you make goes to the house . Everybody works - and that includes you . Are you on drugs ?
JACOB: No .
DAVID: Good . If I catch anything stronger then an aspirin on you , you 're outta here . No arguments . You got that straight ?
JACOB: Yes , sir .
DAVID: Okay . Dinner in two hours . Why do n't you go meet the rest of the gang .

WESLEY: Welcome to fun central .
KAREN: He 's going to be staying with us for a while .
GINA: Oh yeah ? How 'd you get through the lockade ?
SCOTT: Hey , beautiful . How 's it going ?
KAREN: Hi , Scott .
SCOTT: Who 's Barney Rubble ?
KAREN: This is Jacob Johnson . He 's a new esident . At least temporarily .
SCOTT: He better not be rooming with me . I value my privacy .
KAREN: No , I believe that honor goes to Wesley .
WESLEY: Good . I could use the company .
SCOTT: So what 's your story ? Divorce ? Custody attle ? Your parents just plain assholes ?
JACOB: They 're dead .
KAREN: Mellow out , Scott . Give him a chance to settle in .
SCOTT: Just curious .
JACOB: Is he alright ?
SCOTT: He 'll be fine . He just has a problem with cigarettes .
GINA: His parents used to use them as a sick kind of discipline . That 's why he 's here .
JACOB: If you know that , then why do you smoke in front of him ?
SCOTT: It 's not my problem .
JACOB: Just what is YOUR problem , then ?
SCOTT: I took care of my problem . That 's why I 'M here .
KAREN: His dad used to beat him . One day he could n't take it any more .
JACOB: What happened ?
KAREN: He killed him with his father 's gun . Self-defense .
GINA: Everyone here has a fun tale to tell . Is n't that right , Karen ?
KAREN: Yeah . Right .
JACOB: I ca n't sleep .
KAREN: You need to talk ?
JACOB: No . I 'm fine . Thanks .
SCOTT: Come on . Let 's hop to it . Got ta make way for those new indoor tennis courts . The fate of the world lies in the alance . Okay , this load 's full .
JACOB: Yeah , no problem .
SCOTT: I do n't know . Maybe you should think about switching to de-caf or something .
JACOB: You okay ? Gina SCREAMS .
GINA: No ! Yes ! Let go of me !
KAREN: She does n't like to be touched .
JACOB: No shit !
KAREN: Do n't take it personally . It 's not he fault .
JACOB: What happened to her ?
KAREN: Her mother was a hooker . She forced Gina to carry on the tradition . When she was thirteen
JACOB: Jesus .
KAREN: You look terrible .
JACOB: Thanks .
KAREN: I 'm sorryI just wish you 'd tell me what happened to you , that 's all .
JACOB: I ca n't talk about it right now . I 'll tell you later . I promise .
KAREN: Okay . Why do n't you sit and rest for a it . The supervisor 's not around . You look like you could use it .
JACOB: I think I will .
VOICE: Hey , you !
SUPERVISOR: No slacking off . Back to work .
JACOB: What ! Jesus fuckingOh , shit !
SUPERVISOR: Whoa ! Get a grip , boy .
JACOB: Huh ? What 's going on ?
SUPERVISOR: Nothing . That 's the problem . Now that you 've gotten your beauty rest , let 's see if you can change it , okay ?
WESLEY: Are n't you going to bed ?
JACOB: I 'm not tired .
WESLEY: Bullshit . If you looked any more tired , you 'd be dead . Jacob cracks a weary smile in the darkness .
JACOB: That 's right .
WESLEY: You got ta sleep , man .
JACOB: Why ? Who says ? You know , people do n't even really know why we sleep . They have n't found any physical reason for it .
WESLEY: But they do know that you go nuts if you do n't .
JACOB: Sharks do n't sleep . They ca n't pump water through their gills on their own . They have to always keep moving . If they stop , they ca n't breath . If they go to sleep , they die .
WESLEY: You 're not a shark .
JACOB: I know . I 'm just a kid . Do n't worry about me , Wes . Go to sleep .
FREDDY: You ca n't stay awake forever , boy !
WESLEY: I told you you 'd go nuts !
JACOB: Get everybody else . I have to tell them something .
WESLEY: In the middle of the night ?
JACOB: I MEAN it !
SCOTT: I do n't get it . Is this guy alive o dead ?
JACOB: He 's neither . He haunts your dreams and if he kills you , you die for real .
WESLEY: I have n't dreamed of him . I have nightmares like you would n't believe , but never of this guy .
SCOTT: That 's because this all rates an eleven on the bullshit meter ! I do n't know why we have to listen to this crap . You 're scaring the hell out of Wes here .
GINA: Keep your voice down .
SCOTT: It does n't matter . The Ross 's sleep like ocks , which is what we all should be doing .
JACOB: I know this sounds crazy , but I swea it 's true . I went to bed one night and woke up in the middle of the road . Freddy Krueger killed my mother , blasted my whole town into his nightmare , and , worst of all , I think he wants to use me to kill more kids and bring more towns into his world .
KAREN: How ?
JACOB: I 'm not sure . I think I 'm some kind of carrier . He 's somehow inside me and as soon as I fall deep enough into sleep he 'll be let loose . You guys were great to take me in . I just do n't want to thank you by getting you all killed .
SCOTT: Okay . Show me Springwood . Jacob looks at the map and points . SCOTT There 's nothing there .
JACOB: That 's what I 've been trying to tell you .
SCOTT: There 's NEVER been a town there .
JACOB: That 's how YOU see it . I was part of the nightmare , so I 'm the only one who notices the difference .
SCOTT: Look , Jacob . You do n't have to convince us that nightmares are real . Everybody in this room has been through one . And some of us are still living it . But the thing is , we know it 's just in our heads now . It can be just as bad as the real thing was , but it 's still only a memory . It ca n't hurt us physically , unless we do the hurting ourselves .
GINA: And we do n't want to see you get hurt .
WESLEY: We know it gets crazy . And we 'll help out the best we can .
SCOTT: But this is just too hard to believe .
JACOB: You do n't believe me , either , do you ?
KAREN: I do n't know .
JACOB: Why are you still here ?
KAREN: I 'm not sure . I guess , I guess I see a lot of me in you .
JACOB: Feels good to see someone more fucked up than yourself , huh ? Karen smiles and sits down next to him .
KAREN: Yeah . That must be it .
JACOB: But you have n't told me why you 're here at this place .
KAREN: I ca n't talk about it right now . Maybe later . Do you want me to stay with you ?
JACOB: Yeah , that 'd be great . Do n't let me sleep , okay ?
KAREN: I 'll do my best .
JACOB: Yeah . Thank God .
KAREN: Where are you going ?
JACOB: I 'm leaving .
KAREN: Why ?
JACOB: He ca n't hurt you if I 'm gone . Maybe I 'll go to the desert or something . I 'll lie down in the middle of nowhere and finally get some sleep . Krueger can feed of the dreams of snakes and vultures .
KAREN: Fine . You 're just going to take off then
JACOB: Do n't do this to me . I 'm just trying to protect you and the others .
KAREN: Right . You blow into town and then blow ight out . Terrific .
JACOB: I do n't understand why you 're so mad at me .
KAREN: You just do n't get it , do you ?
JACOB: Get what ?
KAREN: Running away does n't help . He sighs and smiles a bit .
JACOB: And you 're going to convince me , huh ?
KAREN: Maybe .
JACOB: Yeah . Sure .
FREDDY: Say it , do n't spray it , huh , Jacob ? Come and join the fun !
KAREN: Jacob !
JACOB: Nooooo !
MR. HOPKINS: I told you ! It 's an overdose ! Jesus Christ , I saw this coming . Call 9-1-1 !
JACOB: No ! Do n't let them take me !
KAREN: Jacob , it 'll be alright .
JACOB: You do n't understand ! Let me go !
DAVID: This is just what we need .
JACOB: Do n't fucking put me under ! You 'll set him free !
FREDDY: Thanks for the lift , kid !
JACOB: What do you want from me ?
FREDDY: I already got it ! The rest I 'm going to get from your new little friends .
JACOB: Leave them alone !
FREDDY: It 's my duty to clean up the neighborhood !
JACOB: What have you done with my town ?
FREDDY: Aw , poor baby 's homesick , is n't he ? Do n't worry . We 'll all be one happy family soon . Wan na be the first recruit ?
JACOB: Over my dead body !
FREDDY: As you wish .
BLADE COP: We have to .
SOUND COP: It 's our job .
FREDDY: Get a new one .
POWER COP: Goddamnit !
JACOB: Alrightjust who the hell are you guys ?
BLADE COP: We 're the Dream Police . Jacob almost laughs .
JACOB: The what ?
POWER COP: The Dream Police . Did n't you hear her , man ?
SOUND COP: I think you 're the wrong guy to talk about attitudes .
BLADE COP: Guys , guys . This is getting us nowhere .
JACOB: Hello ? May I butt in here and ask some more stupid questions ?
BLADE COP: We do n't know much more than you do . What we do know is that we 've been ecruited
JACOB: By who ?
SOUND COP: We do n't know .
JACOB: Why ?
BLADE COP: I think that 's obvious .
POWER COP: The shit 's about to hit the fan .
SOUND COP: Krueger 's discovered new powers .
BLADE COP: He 's ripped a hole between dreams and eality .
POWER COP: Our own powers have been amplified .
SOUND COP: We only hope it will be enough .
BLADE COP: But we 're going to need your help .
JACOB: Me ? What can I do ? Just who are you guysreally ?
BLADE COP: We were like you . We fought Freddy Krueger many years ago . Our souls were eleased from his grip . No we 're back to try again .
JACOB: I still do n't understand what
SOUND COP: Freddy Krueger ca n't hurt us anymore .
POWER COP: Because we 're already dead . Jacob vanishes completely .
JACOB: What 's going on ?
DOCTOR: Just relax , everything 's fine .
JACOB: That 's what you say
DOCTOR: You 're lucky you 're here instead of juvenile hall . You put up quite a fight . But you 're clean . No traces of drugs o alcohol in your blood .
JACOB: I could 've told you that . Jacob starts getting out of bed .
DOCTOR: Hold on there .
JACOB: You said I was fine . I have to get back . My friends are in trouble .
DOCTOR: I said you were n't on drugs , but I neve said you were fine . You 're suffering from extreme fatigue and stress that manifested itself into one hell of an anxiety attack . At least that 's what we hope it is . You had a major seizure , Jacob .
JACOB: You do n't understand . This whole town is in danger .
DOCTOR: We 're keeping you here for observation . You 're not going anywhere tonight .
JACOB: You ca n't do that . You do n't have the ight !
DOCTOR: Yes we do . Your temporary guardian , Mr. Ross , signed all the papers . If you 're okay in the morning we might let you go home . Until then , you 're bed bound .
JACOB: But
DOCTOR: We took off the restraints . Do you want us to put them back on ?
DAVID: Sleep . He closes the door behind him
JACOB: Shit and we hear it LOCK
GINA: Nice movie , huh ? And I came in here to mellow out . She smiles at Wes as she exits . GINA It 's all yours .
SECOND ORDERLY: Yeah , mac . You 've just had a hard day , that 's all .
SECOND ORDERLY: Yeah , Wesley . Have a smoke .
WESLEY: Fuck this .
FIRST ORDERLY: Relax , Wesley .
WESLEY: Dad ?
FREDDY: Yeah , Wesley . Everything 's gon na be great ! Just have a smoke on us !
WESLEY: Go to hell ! Freddy grins .
FREDDY: Right
WESLEY: Noooooooo !
ASSISTANT: I do n't get it . The couch is barely scorched . And how can he burn from just the neck down ?
CORONER: It happens .
ASSISTANT: It happens ? That 's your explanation ?
CORONER: I 've seen worse .
ASSISTANT: What ? What worse ?
CORONER: Never mind .
ASSISTANT: No . I wan na know . Really . What could e worse than
FIRE MARSHALL: You know what the gossip rags are going to say ? Spontaneous human combustion .
COP: What 's that ?
FIRE MARSHALL: That 's where bodies are supposed to go up in smoke for no reason . It 's all psychic ullshit . What really happened is called the candle effect . A tiny fire gets started , usually from a cigarette . It slowly smolders through the blanket and clothes until the skin starts to actually ake . The body fat begins to melt and liquefy , fueling the fire like a slow urning candle . It takes hours , but it 's eal .
COP: He fell asleep while smoking . What a waste .
SCOTT: That 's impossible . Scott and Karen head for the front door .
JACOB: Who ?
KAREN: Wes
JACOB: Oh my God . It 's started .
SCOTT: He fucking burned alive .
KAREN: They said he fell asleep smoking .
SCOTT: And we all know that ca n't be .
JACOB: I already told you how it would happen .
SCOTT: Do n't start with that shit .
JACOB: It 's not shit .
DAVID: C'mon , kids . Everyone inside . Now .
SCOTT: He would never touch a cigarette . You know that .
DAVID: We do n't know anything until the authorities are finished with thei investigation . In the mean time , no work for tomorrow - three day weekend . But Monday , it 's back on the job . Jaco was n't covered in our health plan and his little stint at the hospital cost us a undle . We have to work together or we might lose this place . Okay ?
JACOB: When I was put under , Freddy was eleased . I know this because I dreamed it .
SCOTT: And that dream was real ?
JACOB: Yes . Wesley was his first victim .
SCOTT: Aw , man
JACOB: You said it yourself . How could it have een a cigarette ?
KAREN: And how could hedire that way and not wake up ?
GINA: Maybe the `` authorities '' will figure it out .
SCOTT: I 'm sorry . I just ca n't buy into this .
JACOB: Call me crazybut I think he 's afte Rosedale . The whole place . In my dream he said something about needing a few souls to get the job done . I think he has to kill in order to get the power to suck in a new town .
SCOTT: You are crazy .
JACOB: Thank you . There 's more . There are other people in there . In the nightmares .
KAREN: Like him ?
JACOB: No . Different . There are three of them . They 're dressed in black . They have powers like Freddy , but they seem to be on our side .
KAREN: Who are they ?
JACOB: Well , you got ta hang in there with me on this one . They call themselves the Dream Police . Scott actually laughs .
SCOTT: This is too much .
GINA: You meanlike cops ?
JACOB: I guess .
KAREN: Where are they from ?
JACOB: They 're kids that Freddy killed years ago . THEY do n't even know how they got there . But they 're somehow patrolling dreamworld to put a stop to Krueger .
SCOTT: Then why have n't these guys done the jo already ?
JACOB: They say they need help . I do n't know what or whyyet .
SCOTT: I can tell you who needs help .
JACOB: Hey , I 'm trying to save all of us .
SCOTT: I wo n't believe it until I see it .
JACOB: By then it 'll be too late . It was too late for Wesley .
KAREN: They 're going to use all this to shut us down .
JACOB: I know . It 's my fault .
KAREN: You going to try to run away again ?
JACOB: It 's too late for that . I have to stay and try and put a stop to it .
KAREN: I 'm sorry . It 's all so hard to accept .
JACOB: I wish I could convince you of the dange you and the others are in .
KAREN: I 've been in danger before . THAT I can handle .
JACOB: This is worse than anything you can imagine .
KAREN: I would n't be so sure about that . Come on . Let 's go inside . She stands up .
JACOB: I 'm sorry .
KAREN: I know nightmares are real , Jacob . I know .
JACOB: So did my mom . She taught me a lot about dreams .
KAREN: Like what ?
JACOB: She told me that a lot of people have special dream powers . I inherited some from her - and some I have all to myself . She showed me how I could link up with other people 's dreams - to actually be inside with them .
KAREN: That sounds wonderful . ButI do n't know
JACOB: A little hard to imagine , huh ?
KAREN: Yeah . I 'm sorry .
JACOB: I can convince you .
KAREN: How ?
JACOB: Easy . We 're doing it now .
KAREN: What do you mean ?
JACOB: I mean we 're dreaming . You and me . Together .
KAREN: I do n't believe it .
JACOB: It 's true . We 're really doing it .
KAREN: But what if I 'm just dreaming of you telling me that ?
JACOB: We 'll compare notes when we wake up . Then you 'll know .
KAREN: Did you bring us here on purpose ? Can you go anywhere you want ?
JACOB: Sometimes . It 's not as easy as linking up , though .
KAREN: Wow , I never knew
JACOB: Show off .
KAREN: Look !
JACOB: Karen , no !
KAREN: Oh no
FREDDY: Welcome to Romper Room !
KAREN: Why are you doing this ?
FREDDY: Do n't you remember ?
JACOB: Come on !
KAREN: What ?
JACOB: You heard me . I said wake up !
KAREN: How ? This is my old house . How did I get here ?
JACOB: This is a dream ! You have to get out of here . I 'm not hurting you , only he can eally do that ! Wake up now !
FREDDY: Gettin ' kinky , huh ?
KAREN: I think I get it now .
JACOB: Are you hurt ?
KAREN: Umno .
JACOB: If he had done it , you 'd be dead .
KAREN: You better get back to your room . We do n't want anybody to get the wrong idea .
JACOB: Or the right one ?
KAREN: Get out of here .
JACOB: That 's something else my mom taught me .
KAREN: No . Not tonight .
SCOTT: And I 'm telling you a dream is a dream .
KAREN: Jacob was in there with me .
SCOTT: And where else was he with you last night ?
JACOB: What the hell is that supposed to mean ?
KAREN: I have the picture in my room if you want to see it . He brought it out from the nightmare .
SCOTT: Or from your hope chest . I bet your bed is n't the only thing he 's been into .
KAREN: That picture was destroyed years ago .
JACOB: You better watch your mouth , pal .
SCOTT: I 'm the last person you want to start fucking with .
JACOB: Go ahead and be a tough guy , Scott . Krueger will cut you to pieces before you can even flex a muscle .
GINA: Will you two stop it ! You 're scaring the shit out of me .
KAREN: You should be scared . Mr. Ross enters the room , none too pleased .
DAVID: Alright . What 's going on here ?
SCOTT: Join the fun . Jacob and Karen were just telling us about their new excuse to sleep together .
JACOB: Nothing happened between us last night .
SCOTT: You mean in plain old reality , right ?
DAVID: Okay , everybody . Out . Jacob and I are going to have a little talk . Now .
JACOB: I 'm sorry , but
DAVID: Hey , I do n't know what kind of shit you 're shoveling to these kids , but it 's going to stop . My Good Samaritan instincts have their limits . We 've had enough tragedy around this place . We do n't need you making things worse with fantasies .
JACOB: You do n't understand
DAVID: And I want you to stay away from Karen . Jacob starts to get defiant .
JACOB: It 's a free country .
DAVID: This is n't America , it 's my house . I 've een checking up on you . You have no ecord with the police or the state o any of the runaway groups . You 're the invisible kid . And if I sense even a little bit more trouble-making from you , you 're going to vanish from here . Got it ?
JACOB: Yes , sir .
KAREN: It 's okay . The Ross 's have gone to a council meeting and Scott 's in his room . We should be safe for awhile .
JACOB: Wonderful .
KAREN: Jacob , what are we going to do ?
JACOB: I 'm going to go to bed soon .
KAREN: Now you WANT to sleep ?
JACOB: I have to find the Dream Police . I think I 'm somehow their link to all this . They only seem to appear when I 'm around . You woke me up before I had a chance to talk to them last night .
KAREN: I 'm sorry . I was scared .
JACOB: your fault . I have to ask them what we 're supposed to do to help them . And maybe I can protect Gina while I 'm in there .
KAREN: What about Scott ?
JACOB: He 's on his own .
KAREN: Oh
JACOB: I do n't mean to be cold , but we 've done everything to convince him . Gina 's too scared to understand . I think Freddy will go after her next .
KAREN: What should I do ?
JACOB: You have to stay awake .
KAREN: That 's not going to be easy . I 'm half asleep already .
JACOB: You have to try . She nods her head quietly . Then
KAREN: I 'd better get out of here .
JACOB: Okay . Be careful .
KAREN: YOU be careful . I 'm not going anywhere .
FREDDY: Going up ?
GINA: You 're not real !
FREDDY: Ah , but who is ? The elevator begins to slow . FREDDY Fourth floor . Overpopulation .
FAT MAN: Hi there , princess . Your mom 's told me all about you .
FREDDY: is a maniac trying to get out !
JACOB: Come on !
GINA: Let go of me !
JACOB: I 'm here to help !
GINA: Let 's get out of here .
POWER COP: Where 'd he go ?
SOUND COP: I thought you had him .
BLADE COP: Shit Krueger has escaped .
JACOB: No no no no !
SOUND COP: Stand back .
JACOB: You let him get away !
SOUND COP: It 's difficult .
POWER COP: He 's been at this longer than we have .
BLADE COP: He can do anything .
SOUND COP: But we have to catch him in the act to get him .
JACOB: Whatthere are rules to all this ?
SOUND COP: They 're not rules .
POWER COP: It 's just the way it is .
BLADE COP: Jacob , we need you to bring the rest together .
JACOB: The rest ? You mean the kids at the home ?
BLADE COP: Yes . We need as many of you as we can get . And you must bring them to Springwood .
JACOB: How ?
BLADE COP: You have the power to link your dreams with other 's . Dream of Springwood , then ing the rest with you .
SOUND COP: Living souls are what he thrives on . Living souls are what we need to help stop him .
POWER COP: Before it 's too late .
BLADE COP: Before he takes everyone .
SOUND COP: And every THING . Jacob just shakes his head .
FREDDY: Ahalone at last .
JACOB: Gina ! Jacob jumps out of bed .
KAREN: Is it an earthquake ?
JACOB: No . It 's Freddy .
DAVID: Pack your bags , kids .
JACOB: You 're kicking us out ?
DAVID: No . They 're taking you away . They say it 's for your own good .
KAREN: They ca n't do that .
DAVID: Yes , they can . They consider Mary and I possibly unfit to act as foster parents . They 're going to find temporary homes fo you until this mess is straightened out . I 'm so very sorry .
KAREN: No , please .
DAVID: They 're not calling it an accident this time . They do n't really know what to call it . Karen lets go . Scott stands up .
SCOTT: What 's going to happen to us ?
DAVID: You 'll be alright .
KAREN: What 's going to happen to you ?
DAVID: I do n't know . They 're thinking of pressing charges .
JACOB: Aw , Jesus
DAVID: Come on . A car from juvenile hall will e here in an hour . He leads them up the stairs .
MR. SILVERMAN: I 'm sure most of you know how this works already . You 'll be assigned new foste homes tomorrow afternoon . Tomorrow morning the police will be talking to you egarding the matter at the old house .
KAREN: What about it ?
MR. SILVERMAN: Anything you know .
SCOTT: Are we considered suspects ?
MR. SILVERMAN: You 'll talk to the police about that . Do n't worry . We 'll all try and work this out .
KAREN: Will we be able to go back to the Ross 's ?
MR. SILVERMAN: I do n't know . You 'll have a place to stay in the mean time .
KAREN: Will we be together ?
MR. SILVERMAN: No . We do n't have anybody willing to take more than one person . I 'm afraid you 'll be split up .
SCOTT: Great
MR. SILVERMAN: Hey , you can visit each other . You 'll be in the same town .
JACOB: If it 's still here .
KAREN: Jacob , what are we going to do ?
JACOB: Nothing .
KAREN: What do you mean , nothing ?
JACOB: It 's over . We 're finished . He 's won .
SCOTT: Looks like your hero just gave up . And Karen still ca n't believe it .
KAREN: How can you do this ?
JACOB: Do what ? I 'm not doing anything .
KAREN: Exactly . After all we 've been through you just throw in the towel . Why ?
JACOB: Because we 're fucked . The last thing the Dream Police told me was that they needed all our help . Together . Even if we were n't about to be split up there are n't enough of us left to make a difference .
KAREN: How do you know that ?
JACOB: I do n't . But , it 's all just too much . I 've tried so hard and nothing 's worked . I 'm spent . I 'm wasted . I'mI 'm so tired . Jacob puts his face in his hands . JACOB I 've had enough .
KAREN: So you 're just going to give up ? I 'll et that 's something your mother neve taught you .
JACOB: And we 're not going to waste it . Jacob stands up .
KAREN: Scott , we need you .
SCOTT: Look , I do n't know what 's going on anymore . Two of my friends die and now you tell me I have to drop into dreamland with you guys to do battle with the dude that did it .
JACOB: We 'll have help .
SCOTT: Ah , yes . I almost forgot . The Sleepy Squad . Alright . I 'll make you a deal . I told you I would n't believe this stuff unless I saw it . If I understand this correctly , all I have to do is fall asleep and you just whisk me into the action .
JACOB: Right .
SCOTT: Okay . If that happens , if both of you show up in my dream , I 'll help you out . If nothing happens , then I 'll get a good night 's sleep and laugh at you in the morning .
JACOB: Fine . You got a deal . And you wo n't be disappointed .
KAREN: I 'm going to be sleeping in the girl 's dorm . Will you be able to bring me in ?
JACOB: I hope so . Then I got to make sure we all end up in Springwood .
SCOTT: The old stomping ground ?
JACOB: Yeah . Only right now it 's not a very pretty place .
KAREN: What do we do when we get there ?
JACOB: Play it by ear . And try and stay alive .
SOCIAL WORKER: Half hour til lights out , everyone . The kids get up and start for the door .
JACOB: Off we go .
SCOTT: Into the wild black yonder . Scott shakes his head as they leave .
SCOTT: Freddy Krueger . Yeah , right . Years ago some sicko gets fried and now he comes ack to stick it to you when you 're snoozing . Stupid bedtime story .
BUM: Hey , buddy ?
SCOTT: Yeah , what ?
BUM: Can you spare some change ?
SCOTT: Um , well , let me see
KAREN: Scott ! You 're here .
SCOTT: Yeah . Fun town . Talk to any of the neighbors , yet ? They 're a swell bunch of folks .
KAREN: Uh-huh . Real friendly , too .
SCOTT: So this is a dream ?
KAREN: And I 'm in it with you . Convinced ?
SCOTT: Maybe I 'm just dreaming bout being here with you . Would n't be the first time .
KAREN: Nope . I tired that one already . Does n't work . Come on , we have to find Jacob .
SCOTT: So this is the place , huh ?
JACOB: I 'm home .
KAREN: What now ?
JACOB: Scott , are you with us ?
SCOTT: A deal 's a deal .
JACOB: Then we wait .
SCOTT: Whoa !
POWER COP: Is this all ?
JACOB: All that 's left .
SOUND COP: It 'll have to do .
SCOTT: We can always come back later . Like when it 's daytime .
POWER COP: It 's always night here .
JACOB: What 's the plan ?
BLADE COP: We need you to draw him out .
SCOTT: Terrific . We 're supposed to be bait .
SOUND COP: Essentially .
JACOB: Then let 's do it .
BLADE COP: Fan out . The Dream Police break formation and scatter .
JACOB: Oh no He starts to run and we FOLLOW him .
MUTANT BOUNCER: Two drink minimum .
SCOTT: Ah , that 's okay . I think I 'm underage , anyway .
MUTANT BOUNCER: Two drink minimum .
SCOTT: No , really . I 'm driving .
MUTANT BOUNCER: Two drink minimum .
MUTANT WAITRESS: Can I get you anything ?
SCOTT: That 's okay . I 'll just sit at the bar .
MUTANT WAITRESS: Alright , honey . You call if you need anything .
SCOTT: You bet . You 'll be the first to know .
BARTENDER: What 'll it be ?
SCOTT: Um , a beer , I guess .
BARTENDER: Go on . Puts hair on your back .
SCOTT: And that 's all ?
BARTENDER: No charge . Compliments of the man at the end of the bar .
FREDDY: Welcome to my favorite haunt .
SCOTT: So you 're the man .
FREDDY: At your service .
SCOTT: What 's on your mind ?
FREDDY: A deal .
SCOTT: A deal 's what got me into this .
FREDDY: Bring Jacob to me .
SCOTT: What 's in it for me ?
FREDDY: Power . You do n't need to hang out with those losers . You 're a take-charge kind of guy , Scott . Like when you took charge of your father .
SCOTT: Leave my father out of this .
FREDDY: I 'll make you mayor of Rosedale .
SCOTT: After you make it look like this ?
FREDDY: You can have Karen .
SCOTT: Alive ?
FREDDY: Any way you want her .
SCOTT: Okay .
FREDDY: Shake ?
SCOTT: No thanks . I trust you . Freddy laughs .
JACOB: Mother ?
SCOTT: Mayor of Rosedale . Scott sneers . SCOTT What a crock of shit .
FREDDY: I hate a snitch !
SCOTT: Eat shit
JACOB: Krueger Jacob races for the front door .
FREDDY: Lighten up , bone brain .
MUTANT BOUNCER: Take it outside !
FREDDY: No more playing around .
SOUND COP: Kincaid !
FREDDY: Put a lid on it !
JACOB: I 'm sorry , Scott .
BLADE COP: You should n't be .
SOUND COP: He still exists .
JACOB: What ! How ?
POWER COP: We 're already dead , that 's why he could n't destroy us .
BLADE COP: But he 's not dead . He 's not alive either . He 's something in between .
SOUND COP: He 's not entirely part of reality or part of dreams . He 's unique .
BLADE COP: WE ca n't kill him .
POWER COP: We can wail away on each other until doomsday and not do any good .
JACOB: Then who 's going to kill this fucker ?
SOUND COP: YOU have to .
JACOB: How the hell am I supposed to do that ?
BLADE COP: Krueger 's power comes from his rage and the souls of children .
POWER COP: You have to find the original source of that rage and use it against him .
BLADE COP: This town in its present condition encompasses all evils from all times in its history . The answer is here somewhere Jacob sighs , then gets an idea .
JACOB: I think I know where And he starts to run down the street .
BLADE COP: Jacob , wait . We have to find him first .
JACOB: No time . You guys find Karen !
KAREN: No more
JACOB: The feeling is mutual .
KAREN: Where are the Dream Police ?
JACOB: I told them to look for you . What are you doing here ? Do n't you know what this place is ?
KAREN: I do now . Look what I found .
JACOB: You 've got to get out of here .
KAREN: Wait . You have to see this .
JACOB: You do n't understand . The Police ca n't kill Freddy . They literally chopped each other to pieces and he 's still alive ! Now I 'm supposed to figure out how to get id of him .
KAREN: But I think I found the answer . Shut up for a second and look at these . She starts showing him the scrawlings .
JACOB: Okay , so he 's a bad artist .
KAREN: No ! You told me Krueger 's mothe committed suicide and no one knows who his father was , right ?
JACOB: Yeah
KAREN: Freddy 's been pushing all our buttons with our pasts . These are HIS past . Do n't you get it ? HE was a foster child , too !
JACOB: But in reality Freddy has n't lived here for decades .
KAREN: Like you tried to tell me once before , this is a dream . Who knows why this is all here .
JACOB: All evils from all times in history
KAREN: And is n't this where it all started in Springwood ? On Elm Street ?
JACOB: But what does this do for us ?
KAREN: There 's got to be a way to use it against him .
JACOB: Okay , but we 're not going to stand around here to figure out how . It 's too dangerous .
FREDDY: Time to join your mommy .
KAREN: No no no no no no noJacob
FREDDY: Young loveha !
JACOB: Karendreampowers .
FREDDY: It 's past your bedtime , young lady .
KAREN'S FATHER: That 's my baby . That 's Daddy 's little girl .

WOMAN: You okay , honey ?
KAREN: Yes . I 'm alright .
WOMAN: I 've never seen you around . Are you new in town ?
KAREN: Sort of .
WOMAN: Well then Welcome to Springwood .
GUIDO: You kill your film several times , mostly by talking about it . A film is a dream . You kill it writing it down , you kill it with a camera ; the film might come to life for a moment or two when your actors breathe life back into it - but then it dies again , uried in film cans . Mysteriously , sometimes , in the editing room , a miracle happens when you place one image next to another so that when , finally , an audience sits in the dark , if you 're lucky very lucky - and sometimes I 've been lucky - the dream flickers back to life again . That 's why I 'm secretive .
DANTE: Guido ! You 're here .
GUIDO: Buongiorno , Dante .
DANTE: I 've been looking for you all over the place . The set 's coming along . How are you ?
GUIDO: Bene , grazie , bene .
DANTE: Bene . My God , you look terrible , etter go to makeup , forget you 've got a press conference ?
FAUSTO: He has no tie .
DANTE: Yes , makeup and wardrobe .
FAUSTO: Signor Contini , I 'm Fausto . Good morning , Signor Contini . p. 4
DANTE: He 's counting costs , you know . The Bank wants him here . Do n't speak to him , I speak to him .
FAUSTO: Okay , I have some questions for Signo Contini .
GUIDO: We all have questions for Signo Contini . They head outside .
FAUSTO: Yes , but please , please , I think it 's customary for there to be an approved script and budget before filming commences
GUIDO: Is he going to follow us ?
FAUSTO: It 's not my intention to be difficult . Maestro , I am a huge admirer of Maestro Contini 's movies , your early films areeverybody loves them and I consider it a great honou for me to be here now none the less , I need a script and a budget .
PIERPAOLO: Where do you want your messages ?
GUIDO: On my desk .
PIERPAOLO: There 's no room on your desk . - into the main office -
GUIDO: Under my desk . In the trash . Non lo so .
PIERPAOLO: Some of these are urgent !
GUIDO: Get me a cigarette .
JACONELLI: We will never be ready to shoot in ten days .
GUIDO: Jaconelli -
FAUSTO: Not ready ? !
GUIDO: Ascolta me .
MORE: p. 6
DANTE: He 's not exactly from the bank , Guido .
BENITO: Dottore , Dottore . You have actors waiting for you in your office . Auditions all morning . You should see what I 've found . I found two sisters . Look , they 're right
DANTE: Not now . He 's got the Press Conference .
GUIDO: I need a cigarette . Dante comes in , closing the door behind him . p. 7
DANTE: He needs a shirt and tie , Lilli .
GUIDO: I need a coffee and a cigarette . He lies down .
LILLI: Answer a question , I 'll give you a coffee . Answer another question , I 'll give you a cigarette . And so on .
GUIDO: Actually and an aspirin .
DANTE: We 're running late
LILLI: Calm down . Directing a movie is a very overrated job , we all know it . You just have to say yes or no . What else do you do ? Nothing . Maestro - Should this be Red ? Yes . Green ? No . More extras ? Yes . More lipstick ? No . Yes , no , yes , no , yes , no - that 's directing . Lilli hands Guido the lit cigarette .
GUIDO: That 's right that 's directing . And it does n't seem to make a blind bit of difference , finally , what the answe is
LILLI: So please , Guido , yes or no , do you want any costumes in this film ?
GUIDO: Yes . p. 8
LILLI: You see - simple ! ( handing him an espresso fetched by her assistant ,
ROBERTA: Might I know what period the movie 's in ?
GUIDO: Yes , yes . Soon . Lilli glares at Dante , ushering him away .
LILLI: You know I do n't allow producers in here .
DANTE: Alright . Two minutes Guido .
LILLI: He 's gone . Have you written a word of the script ?
GUIDO: No .
LILLI: Are you in a panic ?
GUIDO: Yes . She ties Guido 's tie for him .
LILLI: Is Luisa going with you to the Press Conference ?
GUIDO: No . Nobody . Dante . And his spy .
LILLI: You need to shave . You look terrible . p. 9
GUIDO: Why is there no fire escape in here ? What if somebody needed to escape ? I ca n't face these reporters . I have nothing to say .
LILLI: You 'll be fine . You 're a world class liar , darling , go out there and lie for Italy , lie for Italia .
GUIDO: What the hell 's wrong with me ? I ca n't sleep . I ca n't think . I ca n't write . I ca n't breathe . My heart is acing . Am I dying , Mamma ? I owe you flowers , I know . I 'll come to the cemetery at the weekend . You should have let me bury you in Roma , Mamma , I could visit you every week . Do n't look at me like that .
MAMMA: Oh , Guido , Guido . He stops at a busy intersection .
GUIDO: I miss you .
MAMMA: I miss you , too .
RADIO REPORTER: And we 're just waiting for the arrival of Continiany moment now - Could this film put the Maestro back on top ?
DANTE: Silenzio , per favoreThank you , thank you
RADIO REPORTER: Dante , Guido Contini 's long time producer , is about to speak
DANTE: I want to say a few words from my heart . I am humbled and thrilled to e able to announce that I am producing Guido Contini 's next film , Italia , which will star once again Contini 's longtime inspiration , the international film star , Claudia Jenssen
GUIDO: Thanks for coming , everybody .
DINARDO: Maestro Contini . Maestro Contini .
GUIDO: Yes .
DINARDO: Grazie . Maestro Contini , your new film is called Italia big title .
GUIDO: Actually , it 's my shortest title yet .
DINARDO: But hardly a modest one .
GUIDO: Films are not modest . They cost too much , they take too long , and they involve too many people . So they should have grand titles .
DINARDO: And might you tell the press what the film is about ?
GUIDO: Why ? I still do n't know what my last film was about .
LEOPARDI: That was the problem . Nobody else did .
GUIDO: Of course I can tell you what my film is aboutI can tell you the story , I can tell you who I am going to cast , the music I want to use , I can tell you everything but I wo n't . I 'm afraid that if I say anything , the word might get out to the Press .
DANTE: Our next film will be exactly as it sounds . Italia . It 's the very spirit of Italy - Italy as myth , Italy as a woman , Italy as a dream .
LEOPARDI: Is this true ?
GUIDO: It sounds fantastic . I ca n't wait to see it .
STEPHANIE: Signor Contini .
GUIDO: Stephanie .
STEPHANIE: Grazie . Could you tell the fashionable women of America who your favorite designer is this year ?
GUIDO: I 'm less interested in the wrapping than what might be inside it .
REPORTER ONE: Signor Contini ! You 're a man of the world , yes ? Educated in Britain , a home in Biarritz . With Italia is it fair to say that you 've come home fo good ?
GUIDO: For good ?
REPORTER FOUR: It 's been a long time since you made a movie with your wife , do you plan on casting her in this new film ? Guido is spinning plates .
GUIDO: I told Luisa that when we got married I would never again make love to my leading lady .
REPORTER FOUR: But she has n't worked at all since working with you .
REPORTER FIVE: But why are you being so tight-lipped about this film ? It 's a serious question . What 's the big deal ? p. 14
GUIDO: I WOULD LIKE TO BE HERE .
LEOPARDI: Signor Contini . Artists do their best work before they 're famous . Now you 're famous . Without wishing to be negative - but your last two films , they 're not , they were
GUIDO: Flops .
LEOPARDI: Your word . Flops . p. 15
LEOPARDI: I 'm just asking if you 're nervous ? You seem nervous
GUIDO: Excuse me ?
LEOPARDI: What I 'm asking , Maestro , is have you un out of things to say ?
GUIDO: I CAN HARDLY STAY UP AND I CA N'T GET TO SLEEP ,
MORNING,: AT THE BOTTOM OF SOME HEAP BUT WHY TAKE IT SO SERIOUSLY ?
STEPHANIE: I was wondering if you think there 's a limit to what you can show in a movie .
GUIDO: What would you like to see that I have n't already shown you ?
TERMS: I WANT TO BE HERE HERE
BUDDHA: BUT NOT HAVE TO BELIEVE IN GOD .
GUIDO: I WANT TO BE YOUNG , BUT I HAVE TO BE OLD .

GUIDO: I love you .
LUISA: Get better . p. 22
DE ROSSI: Your doctor is on his way .

DE ROSSI: It 's a wrong number .
GUIDO: What ?
NURSE: Dottore .

PIERPAOLO: Yes , I 'm sorry . Right now .

LILLI: I 'm happy . I brought my swimsuit .
GUIDO: What ? No . Oh please God . No . I spoke with her yesterday . She did n't even mention it . Give me a cigarette . Lilli points to the one in Guido 's hand .
LILLI: What 's that ? Guido sees the costume .
GUIDO: What 's that ?
LILLI: It 's for Claudia .
GUIDO: For which scene ?
LILLI: Well I do n't know which scene until I ` ve seen the script , but she always likes something like this , or you do .
GUIDO: Looks like the Folies Bergere . It 's wrong . Italian women do n't wear those things . p. 37
LILLI: Do n't knock the Folies Bergere
GUIDO: Why did people love that film ?
LILLI: Oh Guido , do n't . That 's death . Every time we have to start again .
GUIDO: I 'm trying to find it .
LILLI: You wo n't find it with your head jammed halfway up your ass .
GUIDO: Ashtray . She produces one .
LILLI: Halfway . I do n't know . Why not dream up something entertaining , Guido ? Something with musicwith dancing God knows , we could use a little joie de vivre around here
ENTRANCING: THAN AN EVENING YOU SPEND AUX FOLIES BERGERE . FOLIES BERGERE ,
DESPAIR: WHEN HE IS GLANCING AT THE FABULOUS STAGE DES FOLIES BERGERE

LAUGHTER: OF THE FOLIES BERGERE !
CARDINAL'S SECRETARY: The Cardinal is right this way .
CARDINAL: I like Charlie Chaplin .
GUIDO: Me too .
CARDINAL: A genius . What can I do for you ?
GUIDO: Do you believe in God ? The Cardinal 's Secretary is shocked .
CARDINAL'S SECRETARY: Signor Contini , please .
CARDINAL: No , no , it 's an honest question . Yes , I believe in God . p. 42
GUIDO: So do I .
CARDINAL: Are you a Catholic ?
GUIDO: Oh yes , very much so . Not as much as I would like to be , not as much as you would like me to be , I 'm sure , but certainly yes , I 'm trying .
CARDINAL: Try harder .
GUIDO: Yes , yes . I will , I will . You Eminence , I am not happy . I 'm searching for something . I feel a sense of misery , of despair and
CARDINAL: I saw your films . Not the flops , the others , the good ones . But you think people need to see so much sex ? It 's not necessary . We can all imagine .
GUIDO: Excuse me - my films are what I imagine .
CARDINAL: Then your imagination has no moral training .
GUIDO: How do you train the imagination ?
CARDINAL: The imagination is God 's garden ; do n't let the Devil play in it . Teach ou Italian women to be wives , not whores , do n't make us look at filth and debauchery . Make us proud to be Italian
YOUNG GUIDO: Saraghina . Saraghina . Now all the boys join in .
BOYS: Saraghina ! Saraghina !
YOUNG GUIDO: Saraghina ! Sa-ra-ghina !
SARAGHINA: So , you little Italian devils , you want to know about love ? Saraghina will tell youand if you want to make a woman happy , you rely on what you were born with . Because it is in your blood .
PAT,: BUT BE DARING AND UNCARING .

GUIDO: I ca n't breathe , I ca n't breathe .

CARLA: Let me come with you .
GUIDO: It 's impossible .
CARLA: Why ?
GUIDO: Because it 's impossible . Please .
CARLA: But why is it impossible ? Look at you producer ! He 's married , he brings his girlfriend to work and nobody cares . Guido . Everybody knows about me . Why ? Why wo n't you let me near you ?
GUIDO: For the very same reason you do n't want me to die on top of you . It 's not fair to your husband . It 's not fair to my wife . p. 48
CARLA: See , you 're playing with me . You 're twisting everything Please let me come with you .
GUIDO: No . Guido heads towards the door , still dressing .
CARLA: I 'll be here waiting for you with my legs open . Disgusted with himself , he leaves .
GUIDO: Let 's say there were ten sequences , each one set in a different period , ut played by the same cast , a man and a woman , a woman and a man Something light and hectic - like Mozart would do it , like Figaro . Like the circus
DANTE: Claudia is going to be amazing .
BENITO: It sounds like a masterpiece .
FAUSTO: Dante , you see , he has n't written a word
DANTE: The screenplay is first of all a map . That 's a map . p. 49
GUIDO: Let 's try to dig for something else . Maybe a group of people digging , with shovels , in the desert .
LILLI: Guido .
GUIDO: Luisa !
LUISA: The jungle drums said it was an emergency .
GUIDO: The jungle drums exaggerated just a tiny bit .
LUISA: Not entirely . You have n't been sleeping .
GUIDO: I was dying , until just now . Come .
LUISA: Am I already going home ?
GUIDO: I hope not . Happy Birthday , my darling . p. 50
DANTE: Here she is . At last . Magnificent . You know Donatella ?
LUISA: I do now . She leans across to kiss Lilli .
LILLI: You 're saving the movie . Give him a good idea , for God 's sake .
GUIDO: Let 's drink a toast to Luisa 's irthday .
LUISA: It was Monday .
DANTE: Happy Birthday !
LUISA: Thank you .
GUIDO: Happy Birthday .
CARDINAL'S SECRETARY: Maestro . p. 51
GUIDO: Ah , Don Mario . Excuse me , darling , this is Don Mario . This is my wife , Luisa .
CARDINAL'S SECRETARY: A pleasure , Signora .
LUISA: Sit down , wo n't you , Don Mario ?
CARDINAL'S SECRETARY: Oh no .
LUISA: Please .
CARDINAL'S SECRETARY: I was telling your husband how much I admire his movies . Publicly , you know the Church condemns them - we have to - ut we all love them . Last year we did our own version of your Il Vicolo at the Christmas Party .
LILLI: That I would pay to see .
GUIDO: Luisa was in that film .
LILLI: She was the best thing in the movie .
GUIDO: It 's true . It was your first part .
CARDINAL'S SECRETARY: Of course ! - you 're Luisa Acari ! Oh my Lord !
LUISA: I was . Music begins .
CARDINAL'S SECRETARY: You ca n't stop being somebody .
LUISA: Ca n't you ? p. 52
CARDINAL'S SECRETARY: Well there 's a good catholic wife fo you , Guido , that 's what they do - sacrifice . Still , Signora Contini , it must be a very exciting life fo you Luisa looks to Guido . Close up on Guido .
LUISA: MY HUSBAND MAKES MOVIES
ALL: LIKE MICHELANGELO , HE PAINTS HIS PRIVATE DOME
MORE: p. 53
OWN,: THEN WE HAD NO END OF WORLDS TO DISCOVER ,
LUISA: My father 's Italian . My mother 's French .
GUIDO: Thank you .
LUISA: For what ?
GUIDO: Thank you . For what I 'm looking at . Keep running .
LUISA: LONG AGO - SOMEONE ELSE AGO . HOW HE NEEDS ME SO ,
GUIDO: Luisa !
LUISA: I 'm staggered by my own stupidity . I could vomit .
GUIDO: Luisa - will you please just tell me what happened ?
LUISA: You open your mouth and a lie comes out .
GUIDO: What lie ?
LUISA: Why am I surprised ? - it 's like eathing to you .
CARLA: Guido .
GUIDO: There are plenty of restaurants . p. 56
CARLA: I wanted to see the hotel . I told you I came here with my parents when I was little . I did n't come to disturb you .
GUIDO: Well you certainly managed to .
CARLA: Why did n't you tell me Luisa was going to be here !
GUIDO: I did n't know she was here . She just turned up .
CARLA: Well , she could have warned you .
GUIDO: The only privilege my wife has these days is not having to warn me .
GUIDO O.S: A taxi , please , for the Signora .
GUIDO: Carla , you have to wait outside .
CARLA: Will you wait with me ?
GUIDO: I 'm in the middle of a working dinne with my colleagues .
CARLA: So why do I have to wait outside ?
GUIDO: I 'll find someone to escort you home .
DE ROSSI: Signora , would you rather wait inside ?
CARLA: I 'm going to walk . Please tell my friend I had to leave . She walks away .
GUIDO: Apparently she 's staying in some grotesque pensione next to the station . Luisa does n't move .
LUISA: Very plausible .
GUIDO: Because it 's true .
LUISA: You told me it was finished .
GUIDO: It is . Look , she was worried about me , she came to see if I was all right - which yes , is stupid but not , as fa as I know , a crime , and hardly a mortal sin . Luisa suddenly laughs , disconcertingly . p. 58
LUISA: Nothing . If you could see yourself . I could n't live with it - the absurdity of being you , the effort of having to hide and lie and cheat . It 's exhausting , no wonder you 've got no script , you 're too busy inventing you own life .
GUIDO: It 's finished . It 's finished . If it was n't before , it is now .
LUISA: Blah blah blah blah blah .
GUIDO: Vodka . A voice comes from behind him .
STEPHANIE: So , coincidence . You being here . And me being here . p. 59
GUIDO: Amazing . May I take a cigarette ?
STEPHANIE: That was quite a performance . At the Press Conference . The Vanishing Act .
GUIDO: Please .
STEPHANIE: Grazie .
GUIDO: Prego .
STEPHANIE: I 've seen all your movies .
GUIDO: Really ?
STEPHANIE: Like a million times . They 're the only movies that tell the truth about the modern world .
GUIDO: And what truth is that ?
STEPHANIE: Death of religion Sexual evolution
GUIDO: I do n't think religion is dead . And what exactly is the sexual revolution ?
STEPHANIE: That we can talk about later .
GUIDO: Style .
STEPHANIE: Every frame is like a postcard .
GUIDO: Okay .
STEPHANIE: It 's great you care as much about the suit as the man wearing it .
GUIDO: I hate that man .
STEPHANIE: No ! Style is the new content ! It 's what my readers love . They want to dress like Claudia Jenssen . They want to undress like Claudia Jenssen . They want to ride on a Vespa down the Via Veneto . They want to live in an Italian movie .

GUIDO: I 'm here .
DOCTOR RONDI: Signor Contini . As Guido makes to leave -
CARLA: Come back . Guido reassures her with a gesture .
DOCTOR RONDI: She took five or six pills , enough to make herself very sick . I understand she 's your mistress . This is a sordid business . You movie people , I suppose you do n't conside yourself bound by morality

GUIDO: It 's good to see you .
CLAUDIA: I 'm assuming that 's code for there 's no script . Guido is exasperated .
GUIDO: Why is everybody so suddenly obsessed with the script ?
CLAUDIA: So Lilli says I 'm playing a million different parts -
GUIDO: Not a million - you 're the muses , the incredible women who made Italy what it is today , a country run by men - who are themselves run by women , whether they know it or not .
CLAUDIA: So I 'm the women behind the great men ?
GUIDO: The great women

CLAUDIA: I ca n't keep playing that part .
GUIDO: I fall in love with you every time .
CLAUDIA: When there 's a camera between us .
GUIDO: No .
CLAUDIA: It 's not a real person , Guido . And this man you describe - he does n't know how to love .
GUIDO: There was a time once , we were on location , some terrible hotel - and you were in the room directly above me and I could hear you walking about Guido sits down at the edge of the fountain .
CLAUDIA: And why did n't you ?
GUIDO: I do n't know . I do n't know .

LUISA: YOU WANT MY LOVE ? TAKE IT ALL
GUIDO: What for ?
LUISA: Thank you for reminding me I 'm not special . You do n't even see what you do , do you ? Even the moments I think are ours , it 's just you working to get what you want .
GUIDO: What are you talking about ? He stands up , leans on the chair back .
LUISA: And this is our life . You think to create is to forgive yourself in public . Fine . But do n't think I can forgive you in private , because I ca n't ever .
GUIDO: What have I done ? What have I done , Luisa ?

MAMMA: No one can help you find your way . It 's up to you , Guido . Up to you . Nobody else .

LILLI: I 'm glad she 's acting again . I made her costumes for the play . She 's funny .
GUIDO: She seemed so happy . I did n't want to interfere Is she with anybody ?
LILLI: Guido , she 's my friend . I 'm not he mother . I do n't know . I expect so . Nobody likes to be alone . Promise me you 're going to let me cut your hai and get rid of that awful beard . p. 89

GUIDO: No , no . Nobody .
LILLI: Well , it sounds exciting . Walking around and not seeing anyone , growing a beard . I might come up here and join you .
GUIDO: Do n't tease me , Lilli . My heart is -
LILLI: - I know .
GUIDO: I just miss her . I should have IDIOT tattooed on my forehead .
LILLI: Luisa certainly thinks so .
GUIDO: Does she ? Did she really say that ?
LILLI: Stop ! I 'm not going to act as a postman between you both . Come back to Rome . Make a movie . Go to work . He sits . Lilli joins him .
GUIDO: No . Never . I 've spent this time trying to learn something , Lilli , to not be the person who forgets about everybody else , the person who neve grew up . p. 90
LILLI: You 're such a dope , are n't you ? Making movies was n't your problem . You were your problem . Do n't stop being a child . You 'll never make anothe movie ! Nobody wants that especially Luisa . She indicates the people who pass .
GUIDO: The only movie I could make now would e I do n't know would be about a man trying to win back his wife .
LILLI: Sounds perfect . The costumes might not be so bad too .
YOUNG GUIDO: We 're ready to begin !
GUIDO: I ca n't remember how you do this .
PIERPAOLO: You 'll remember .
GUIDO: I do n't want to say too much . The first way that we kill our film is by talking about it . But this scene is about reconciliation . And within the scene I would like you to try and find your way to begin that journey back towards each other .
YOUNG GUIDO: Presto ! Presto ! Take your places ! Andiamo ! Andiamo ! The dressing rooms begin to empty . p. 92
GUIDO: Maybe it 's the most important building lock that we have to begin again We start from the beginning each time and I feel today as if I 'm starting from the beginning . We 'll just keep asking each other questions , and do n't look to me for the answers , okay ?
PIERPAOLO: Maestro , should I call final checks ?
GUIDO: Yes .
PIERPAOLO: Makeup , please ! Final checks !
CLAPPER LOADER: Slate .
GUIDO: ACTION .
GARY: Hey ! Do you sell crack ? The boys look wary .
MARGARET: La la la la la . Like you 've neve done worse .
MARGARET: I know . We need to go out the back .
GARY: Are there reporters out front ?
MARGARET: A few . Not Hugh Grant level . More like Robert Downey , Jr. when he oke into that family 's house and slept in the kid 's bed like Goldilocks . `` This bed is just ight . '' I handled episodes two through four for Robert . This sort of thing is my specialty .
GARY: What is ?
MARGARET: Famous fuck-ups . Do n't worry . Mama 's gon na take good care of you . A phone RINGS .
PAROLE OFFICER: Answer it . Gary picks it up .
GARY: Hello ? Yes . Yes .
PAROLE OFFICER: Use your normal voice .
GARY: Nine dogs ran through the field . The koala sits in the tree .
MARGARET: It 's computer voice recognition . The system can call you any time day or night . If you do n't answe within five rings , the police come and haul your ass off .
GARY: What if I 'm not here ? Catching the officer 's concerned look
MARGARET: That 's why it 's called house arrest . You stay inside you house . He can take direction , I promise .
GARY: I did n't mean to burn down my house .
MARGARET: Yeah , I did n't mean to eat my way into a ten-year shame spiral , but I did , and it 's healthier to acknowledge it . This flammable house belongs to one of Lola 's other fabulous clients , who is currently shooting a pilot in Toronto .
GARY: Actor ?
MARGARET: Writer . So for the next six weeks , su casa es su casa . I say , feel free to wear his clothes . He 'll probably get a sick thrill of out it . The gays . Noticing two crates
GARY: He has dogs ?
MARGARET: They 're away at summer camp . Now , try the bed . He lies back on it , feeling it out .
GARY: It 's fine .
MARGARET: Comfortable ?
GARY: Sure . She massages his besocked feet .
MARGARET: Look , Gary , I know this has been crazy and stressful . I want you to feel safe . And comfortable .
GARY: I do .
MARGARET: I 'm a fan of yours , you know . You number-one fan .
GARY: I do n't do heroin .
MARGARET: Yeah , crack is classy . And I 'm not uying you porn . There 's spray-per- view on cable .
GARY: Good . I really was n't concerned about my career , my family or my future . I just wanted to jack off .
MARGARET: Let me see your phone .
GARY: C'mon ! All my numbers are in that .
MARGARET: Dial ten digits at random . Whoeve answers will be better than the people on this phone . She picks up the liquor box , ready to go .
GARY: I guess .
MARGARET: Poltergeist , and no . Maybe they were rats . L.A. is teaming with ats . They live in the palm trees .
GARY: Sure . Maybe . He 's obviously not convinced .
MARGARET: Okay . You know I 'm a licensed psychotherapist .
GARY: Really ?
MARGARET: No . I 'm a publicist . My job is what other people think of you , not what you think of yourself . So pull your shit together . I am thisclose to getting Christine Walsh to do your piece in Parade .
GARY: Parade ? I fucking hate Parade .
MARGARET: Everyone hates Parade . But the people who watch `` Crime Lab , '' they love their Marilyn Vos Savant . Give them a woman of indeterminate age who solves riddles and they are in hee-haw heaven .
GARY: Okay .
MARGARET: One heartfelt act of contrition and maybe the showrunner wo n't kill off your character between seasons . He nods . He gets it .
GARY: I 'm not crazy .
MARGARET: Exactly . Exactly .
WOMAN'S VOICE: Sorry ! Really sorry .
SARAH: I 'm working on my putting , if you can believe it . Indeed , she 's holding a putter .
GARY: Not really .
SARAH: Okay . Maybe I was just looking fo a way to meet my infamous neighbor . You see , I 'm under house arrest , too .
GARY: What did you do ?
SARAH: I had sex with my husband .
GARY: That 's awful .
SARAH: Nine months later , I had Jaden . That 's her over there . She points to a small portable baby monitor .
GARY: She 's cute .
SARAH: She 's sleeping for another seventeen minutes . She keeps to a schedule .
GARY: She sounds really boring .
SARAH: She is . A beat . A smile between them .
GARY: You 're rich . Should n't you have a nanny from Ecuador ?
SARAH: I 'm Canadian .
GARY: Ohhh
SARAH: I ca n't work in the U.S. Plus , I want to maintain this air of moral superiority by doing everything myself .
GARY: Very Canadian .
SARAH: Thanks . Another pregnant pause .
GARY: I 'm pretty sure I 'll be here .
SARAH: It 's a date .
GARY: Is it ?
SARAH: Oh . I 'm Sarah , by the way .
GARY: Gary .
SARAH: Yeah . I know .
SARAH: The best of all possible worlds .
GARY: Okay .
SARAH: Voltaire . Candide . Are you actually reading it ?
GARY: I thought I was . He gets up .
SARAH: Sorry I bailed . Jaden had a fever .
GARY: Ah ! How boring of her . She hands him the wine .
SARAH: Housewarming gift .
GARY: Demon liquor .
SARAH: The best part is , I can drink it . I pumped before I came .
GARY: So did I .
GARY: so it 's kind of hard to prove that I only meant to burn my ex- girlfriend 's stuff , and not the entire house .
SARAH: Yeah . Fire 's tricky that way .
GARY: How about you ? Any history of arson ?
SARAH: Strangely enough
GARY: I knew it ! I could see that little spark .
SARAH: It was n't arson . Probably .
GARY: Oh shit .
SARAH: I 'll never forget the look on my father 's face as he gathered me up in his arms and raced through the urning building , out onto the pavement .
SARAH: Then I fell in love with the most wonderful boy in the world . We would take long walks by the rive or just sit for hours gazing into each other 's eyes . We were so very much in love . Then one day he went away and I thought I 'd die . But I did n't . And when I did n't , I said to myself , `` Is that all there is to love ? ''
SARAH'S VOICE: Is that all there is , is that all there is ? If that 's all there is my friends , then let 's keep dancing . Let 's break out the booze and have a ball , If that 's all there Just as they 're about to kiss ,
SARAH: I need to
GARY: Just
SARAH: My shoes . Are here . Okay .
GARY: Do n't worry about it . Just
SARAH: I 'm going . Bye .
GARY: Goodnight .
VOICE: The cat says meow ! The pig says oink ! Gary smiles to himself .
GARY: Hello . It 's the parole system .
GARY: Jesus ! You scared the shit out of She signs `` What 's wrong ? ''
NOELLE: You 're hurt .
GARY: I do n't speak that . Sorry . I do n't
NOELLE: Mom is at the car . Where you left her . Again , Gary has no idea what she 's saying .
GARY: Look , you need to go back , okay ? You should n't be out here . It 's not safe . Noelle glances to her left .
MARGARET: Think of it like an electronic leash . Basically , if you ever go more than 100 feet from the base station
GARY: the cops come and throw my ass in jail .
MARGARET: No . I kick your ass . Then the cops come and throw your ass in jail . The parole officer smiles .
GARY: Do I still have to answer the phone ?
MARGARET: No , I 'll be doing that from now on . I 'm moving into the guest room .
GARY: I do n't need a babysitter .
MARGARET: Despite all evidence to the contrary . Do n't worry , I 'm a cool oomie . Who do you think taught Affleck how to gamble ?
GARY: So the guy was like , `` Do you know fencing ? '' And I say , of course . That 's what it says on my headshot .
MARGARET: Lies !
GARY: Always . So he says , `` Foil or epi ? ''
MARGARET: Epée .
GARY: I say , I 'm about equal in both .
MARGARET: Which is true .
GARY: So he tosses me this fucking Conan sword and goes after me . I 'm just swinging , trying to stay alive . But I end up cutting his ear .
MARGARET: You cut his ear off ?
GARY: Just a little . But I got the job . Margaret is confused .
MARGARET: Wait . You were in Pirates of the Caribbean ?
GARY: Yes . No . Not the movie , the ride . I was like , `` Gar ! Keep both hands inside the boat ! '' Margaret laughs so hard she coughs .
MARGARET: Goodnight , fuckface . Gary looks out his door .
GARY: Goodnight , you filthy whore . Both doors shut .
MARGARET: It 's incredible .
GARY: I know . Whenever I see them , and I always feel like , damn
MARGARET: I was born at the wrong time .
GARY: Exactly .
SARAH: Where 's the warden ?
GARY: Groceries .
SARAH: Quite the little missus . She walks past him , into the house .
GARY: How 's Jaden ?
SARAH: Boring . We have n't had nearly the grand old time you two have been having . There 's an edge to her voice .
GARY: You 've been watching .
SARAH: Well . I do n't want to meddle in your affairs .
GARY: My affairs ?
SARAH: Everyone needs affection . I get it . She 's headed back for the door .
GARY: I do n't . Are you seriously jealous ?
SARAH: The opposite . I just want to protect her .
GARY: From what ?
SARAH: From you . Look at you . You date models . Actresses . Tennis players .
GARY: Yeah .
SARAH: On a scale of one to ten , you elong with the Nines . We both know you wo n't settle for less . With that , she 's gone .
MARGARET: What are `` the Nines ? ''
GARY: What ?
MARGARET: `` Look for the Nines . ''
GARY: It 's not mine .
MARGARET: It 's your handwriting .
GARY: I did n't write it .
MARGARET: Okay .
GARY: What ?
MARGARET: Nothing .
GARY: Seriously , what ?
MARGARET: Nothing . I thought you wereforget it . Done . Sorry .
MARGARET: I know who you are .
SARAH: Really .
MARGARET: I know what you are . And if you come near him again
SARAH: You 'll what ?
MARGARET: Margaret .
SARAH: I like that . `` Margaret . '' Classic .
MARGARET: Why ca n't you just leave him alone ?
SARAH: Alone ? He 's an actor . If nobody 's watching him , he does n't really exist . And for the record , I 'm not the one deceiving him .
MARGARET: Goodnight , ratface .
GARY: Goodnight .
SARAH: Hey neighbor .
GARY: Hi .
SARAH: Sorry for the psychotic episode . I 'll blame it on hormones .
GARY: Okay .
SARAH: Are you alright ? You look a little Beautiful Mind-ish .
GARY: How many times should the numbe nine come up ? Probablistically ?
SARAH: Probablistically ?
GARY: You know what I mean .
SARAH: One time out of ten .
GARY: How about every time ? He hands her the paper through the bars .
SARAH: Some of these are prices . There 's going to be a lot of nines when
GARY: There is something wrong with the world .
SARAH: You have an eyelash on your here
MARGARET [O.S.]: Morning .
GARY: Peachy .
MARGARET: Peachy 's good . I like peaches .
GARY: Sure .
SARAH: You have to trust me .
MARGARET: You okay ?
GARY: No .
MARGARET: Oh .
GARY: Tell me about the Nines .
MARGARET: The Nines ?
GARY: The Nines .
MARGARET: Sort of hard to start there
GARY: Try . And do n't tell me I 'm imagining it . They 're showing up everywhere , and I want to know why .
MARGARET: Best guess ? They 're you subconscious trying to remind you who you are .
GARY: I 'm a Nine ?
MARGARET: Yes . It does n't make a lot of sense of out context . Coffee ?
GARY: Why do n't you drink coffee ? You 're always drinking tea .
MARGARET: Happy ?
GARY: Talking .
MARGARET: On the phone . Usually .
GARY: I never met you before I came here .
MARGARET: You , Gary , never met me . But you 're not always I can understand why you 're a little confused .
GARY: No . I 'm a lot confused .
MARGARET: Theories ?
GARY: This is all a dream .
MARGARET: No .
GARY: I 'm in a coma .
MARGARET: No .
GARY: Then I 'm dead . This is Hell , o Purgatorium or something .
MARGARET: Okay , a purgatorium is where Romans vomited . But no . This is as real as anything can be .
GARY: What does that mean ?
MARGARET: Everything is what it is . But you 're not who you think you are .
GARY: What happens if I cross this line ? The tear in her eye falls .
MARGARET: I do n't know . But it 's not good .
GARY: Oh shit . The world ignites in white-hot atomic flames .
GAVIN: `` Knowing '' is a one-hour drama about a woman whose husband disappears . She starts to believe that he daughter is the key to a dark conspiracy .
SUSAN: You 're shooting a pilot .
MELISSA: I love it . I 'll do it .
GAVIN: It 's really hard to think about leaving for six weeks .
GAVIN: Puggies ! Gavin 's PUGS pounce all over him .
SUSAN: I just do n't know if you need the cold open . People want to get ight to the story . ANGLE ON the Editor , bristling a bit .
GAVIN: I invited Susan to see a rough cut ecause I trust her taste . INTERCUT editing suite .
SUSAN: Could we be more clear why Mary is so freaked out at that moment ?
GAVIN: Wow . I thought it was pretty obvious . And dramatic .
SUSAN: I know . But that 's Roger 's big thing this season . Never let the audience be confused .
GAVIN: So we 're trying to squeeze in a wild line over this shot of Noelle .
MELISSA: What 's the line ?
GAVIN: How could you
MELISSA: Howkajew ?
GAVIN: Yeah .
MELISSA: Howkajew . It sounds like koshe drug paraphernalia . Like , come on Shmuley ! Have a toke on the Howkajew .
GAVIN: I know . It 's just for the test screening .
MELISSA: They really think people wo n't get it ?
GAVIN: The dumb people might not .
MELISSA: I did n't think we were making the show for dumb people . A beat .
GAVIN: That 's how I like ya . Melissa giggles .
GAVIN: That guy 's looking at me .
SUSAN: He ca n't see you .
MODERATOR: How about you ? Did you feel it was
AGITATED MAN: It 's not real .
MODERATOR: And what do you mean by that ?
AGITATED MAN: The show 's not real . Why ca n't you see that ? Jesus ! Are you fucking lind ? You think you 're above it all , do n't you ? You are trapped here with the rest of them , brother .
GAVIN: The guy was crazy . Obviously . The show is kinda twisted , and it just flipped something in him .
SUSAN: Did you have a chance to look at the cards yet ?
GAVIN: From the screening ? Melissa reaches in , grabbing the vodka .
MELISSA: Pardon me . Daddy needs his drink .
SUSAN: People write stuff on the cards they wo n't say in a focus group . They get more specific . He SHAKES the mixer .
GAVIN: The Nines .
SUSAN: They 're the one who think your show is almost the best thing they 've ever seen . They get your vision . They just want it to be even etter . Melissa YELLS from the living room
MELISSA: Round two is starting without you !
SUSAN: So you 'll look at the cards ?
GAVIN: Absolutely .
SUSAN: Sometimes the numbers point things out that you do n't want to admit to yourself . In this case , Melissa . INSERT Comment cards .
GAVIN: She does n't have a ton to do in the pilot . There 's so much to set up , you do n't get a lot of Melissa- time .
SUSAN: True . That 's one of the challenges with a premise pilot .
GAVIN: But the network still likes the show ?
SUSAN: Of course . Roger is your biggest cheerleader .
GAVIN: How about above Roger ?
SUSAN: Roger calls the shots .
GAVIN: After he consults with the Highe Powers .
SUSAN: True .
GAVIN: Do they like the show ?
SUSAN: They have n't seen it . They 're watching all the pilots on Friday . A beat .
GAVIN: Why are you focusing on Melissa ?
SUSAN: Because she 's the biggest concern .
GAVIN: She 's also the biggest star in the show .
SUSAN: No , you 're the biggest star . Roge made a huge deal with you , and he went along with casting Melissa when that was n't his instinct .
GAVIN: Well , hooray for Roger . I do n't understand what you want me to do .
SUSAN: Meet with someone .
GAVIN: Who ?
SUSAN: Dahlia Salem .
GAVIN: Yes . And you put her in Gatin 's pilot .
SUSAN: It 's dead . It 's dying . But the network loves Dahlia . So if she could jump over to your show
GAVIN: Replace Melissa and reshoot the pilot .
SUSAN: Roger would pay for it .
GAVIN: So is this even about Melissa ?
SUSAN: It 's about getting your show on the air . That 's all that matters in the end .
GAVIN: I see why the network loves her . It 's just , I wrote the part fo Melissa . She 's one of my best friends . And in my head , I only see Melissa for the role . Could Dahlia do it ? Absolutely . It could work . I just do n't know if I want it to work .
GAVIN: When I get stressed out , I play videogames . It 's my therapy . I ca n't have them on my own computer , ecause then I 'd never write . So I come down to Koreatown .
GAVIN: If we 're really going to replace Melissa , I want to hear it from Roger .
SUSAN: Roger 's on a flight to London . But I talked with him before he left . He said yes on Dahlia .
GAVIN: What does that mean ?
SUSAN: It means yes .
GAVIN: Yes , replace Melissa ?
SUSAN: He wants your show on the air , starring Dahlia . I just got off the phone with her agents . They love it . She loves you .
GAVIN: What about Melissa ?
SUSAN: You want me to call her agents ?
GAVIN: God no . I 'll tell her .
MELISSA: As long as he needs me , I know where I must be INTERCUT with on-camera INTERVIEW
GAVIN: I think my house is haunted .
MELISSA: Your house is really old .
GAVIN: 1926 . Ever since I got back , I feel like there 's someone else there . And then last night , I thought I heard something . A woman singing .
MELISSA: Shit . Like a ghost ?
GAVIN: I guess . And then I saw something . I ran into someone .
MELISSA: The woman ?
GAVIN: It was a man . I think it was me . A beat while Melissa processes .
MELISSA: Your house is haunted by yourself ?
GAVIN: Yeah .
MELISSA: Gavin , are you alright ?
GAVIN: No . No .
MELISSA: Oh my God .
GAVIN: And I 'm letting them , because I eally want the show on the air . I have all these characters inside my head , and they want to live . I 'm the only way they can . This is the only way they can . I have five seasons mapped out , and though it sucks , either you go away , or the show goes . I had to make a decision , and that 's the decision I made . I 'm sorry .
MELISSA: So it 's done . Finished . Decided .
GAVIN: Yes .
MELISSA: I understand . It 's not your fault . You 're morally incapable of doing the right thing . Gavin does n't rise to the challenge .
GAVIN: I do n't want to do this on camera .
MELISSA: No , because you ca n't control it . Your little puppets are off thei strings , running around . Saying things you did n't write . Reality terrifies you .
GAVIN: Reality .
MELISSA: Yes .
GAVIN: The reality is , you would not be here without me . I gave you you first few roles . And your caree is a result of that . With exaggerated relief
MELISSA: God , thank you . Thank you fo finally playing that card . I always knew you were holding onto it , the `` I invented Melissa McCarthy card . '' Congratulations , you win . The game is over .
SUSAN: Upfronts is the week each year when the networks present their fall schedule to advertisers .
GAVIN: Sort of like , `` Here 's our new shit . Like it ? '' Upfronts is a complete oxymoron , ecause no one is remotely honest .
SUSAN: The schedule is a secret until it 's announced , so everything is still in play .
GAVIN: But hey ! At least you 're in New York !
WOMAN'S VOICE: God . Hi . Gavin .
DAHLIA: You 're doing yourshow . She means the camera filming them .
GAVIN: Get on . Come join reality television . She steps on . Hits the button for `` Lobby . ''
DAHLIA: Just now . This whole last 24 hours has been surreal .
GAVIN: I just said surreal .
DAHLIA: You 're good ? I wanted to call you .
GAVIN: Please . Call anytime . I do n't sleep .
DAHLIA: I just felt weird about what happened . Not sure he 's following
GAVIN: Did something happen ?
GATINS: Look , I 'm sorry . But I 'm kind of not . I want my show on the air . And I think it was shitty for you to go after Dahlia behind my back .
GAVIN: I heard your show was gone .
GATINS: I `` heard '' you fired Melissa McCarthy without having a backup . Why would they pick up your show when you do n't have a star ?
GAVIN: The network wanted Dahlia .
GATINS: Yeah , in my show . We tested right efore you . Our numbers were through the roof .
GAVIN: Really .
GATINS: Really . Who 's your exec ?
GAVIN: Susan Howard .
GATINS: She would know . She was there . Ask her .
SUSAN: I 'm at the UTA party . Yeah . Did you hear about Ricky 's assistant ? She literally shat herself . No , I saw it .
GAVIN: I will break your fucking finger .
SUSAN: I 'll call you back .
GAVIN: Bullshit .
SUSAN: They 're only picking up two dramas .
GAVIN: The rest is , what , reality ?
SUSAN: You can go mid-season .
GAVIN: You can go to Hell .
SUSAN: Wow . She takes a beat , trying to size him up .
GAVIN: Did n't you ?
SUSAN: G. , I 'm on your side . Trust me , I 'm the only one who is trying to protect you .
GAVIN: All I want to know is why .
SUSAN: You want a motive ?
GAVIN: Yes .
SUSAN: This is n't `` Crime Lab . '' No one got murdered .
GAVIN: My show did . So tell me why .
SUSAN: I had to get you away from her . She was holding you back .
GAVIN: Melissa .
SUSAN: You had to give her up . C'mon , G. If she really mattered , you could n't have betrayed her so easily .
GAVIN: I did n't .
SUSAN: What , you 're the victim ? The big Creator ca n't stand up to one little d-girl ? It was your choice . I did n't make you do anything . I mean , do you have any principles ? Do you believe in anything but you own ego ?
GAVIN: Fuck you .
SUSAN: Your dialogue used to be sharper . Maybe Gatins could do a polish .
GAVIN: Look , I do n't want to do this anymore . My show 's not going to happen , so this show is over .
GAVIN: I 'm fine .
OCTAVIA: Who were you talking to ?
GAVIN: Oh God .
MARGARET: I can understand why you 're a little confused .
GARY: No . I 'm a lot confused .
MARGARET: Theories ?
GARY: This is all a dream .
MARGARET: No .
GARY: I 'm in a coma .
MARGARET: No .
GARY: Then I 'm dead . This is Hell , o Purgatorium or something .
MARGARET: Okay , a purgatorium is where Romans vomited . But no . This is as real as anything can be .
GARY: What does that mean ?
MARGARET: Everything is what it is . But you 're not who you think you are .
GARY: Okay , then . Who am I ? With practiced calm
MARGARET: You 're a multi-dimensional being of vast , almost infinite power . You created this world on a whim , and decided to stick around to see how it turned out . You , this body you 're in , is just one of you incarnations . Avatars . Call you what you will . Not sure he follows
GARY: Are you saying I 'm God ?
MARGARET: Technically , no . If God is a ten a theoretical ultimate , that-which- no-greater-can-be-imagined you 're more of a nine .
GARY: So what are you ?
MARGARET: Humans are sevens . Monkeys are sixes .
GARY: What are the eights ?
MARGARET: Koalas . They 're telepathic . Plus , they control the weather . She did n't mean to get on that tangent
GARY: Yeah .
MARGARET: Okay .
GARY: I understand . But I do n't believe you .
GABRIEL: Noelle ! Do n't get too far ahead .
MARY: No . You had ice cream at lunch . Noelle begs to differ . More signing .
GABRIEL: Apparently frozen yogurt does n't count .
MARY: I 'll make note .
GABRIEL: Should n't have to .
MARY: Shit .
GABRIEL: Battery is dead . Least the starte is .
MARY: How do we ?
GABRIEL: We call the service . That 's all we can do .
MARY: It 's just the little battery that 's dead , right ? The big one is probably fine .
GABRIEL: I guess .
MARY: We ca n't jump it from one battery to the other ? Cross-over somehow ?
GABRIEL: Who did you marry ? MacGyver ?
MARY: Are you getting a signal ?
GABRIEL: No . Do you ? She checks her phone . A long beat .
MARY: Yes ! One bar .
GABRIEL: The minute you try to place a call , the bar goes away .
MARY: Keep trying .
GABRIEL: Okay , I 'll keep trying , Mary . But it will keep happening .
MARY: Well , what do you want to do ?
GABRIEL: I do n't know . He tries redial .
MARY: Maybe if you hold it up higher .
GABRIEL: The problem is we 're boxed in . It 's a canyon . A beat .
MARY: That 's at least a mile .
GABRIEL: I can run that .
MARY: Sowe stay here ?
GABRIEL: You okay with that ?
MARY: I do n't think we have a choice , so , yeah . Go .
GABRIEL: Daddy 's going to get a truck to help us out . You take care of you mom , okay ? Noelle nods .
SIERRA: No , I do n't . There 's no service up here .
GABRIEL: Yeah , I 'm finding that out .
SIERRA: You can usually get a signal up at the ranger station .
GABRIEL: Okay
SIERRA: You follow the road . It 's probably I do n't know . You have a car ?
GABRIEL: It 's dead . That 's why I need
SIERRA: Oh
GABRIEL: Yeah .
SIERRA: I can call somebody when I get to town . Trying to temper his frustration
GABRIEL: I believe you . I do . But you do n't know where the car is . And the guy might not come . We ca n't e up here all night . Sierra backs away .
SIERRA: I 'm sorry .
GABRIEL: Do n't be sorry . Just help me out here .
SIERRA: No . I ca n't . I 'm sorry .
GABRIEL: Why wo n't you trust me ? She does n't turn back , heading down the road .
MARY: Okay , but you have to be careful , understand ? You have to use Big Girl hands .
GABRIEL: Were you following me ?
SIERRA: Once I was sure you were n't following me . I 'm sorry , it 's just
GABRIEL: You thought I was Ted Bundy .
SIERRA: Kinda .
GABRIEL: My name 's Gabriel . Bundy . She smiles .
SIERRA: Sierra . They shake .
GABRIEL: Yeah .
SIERRA: So , listen . I 'm parked that way . She points off the road , through the forest .
GABRIEL: Really ?
SIERRA: Yeah . Make up some karma .
GABRIEL: Lead the way .
SIERRA: Okay , confession . I kind of ecognized you .
GABRIEL: Really ?
SIERRA: I was n't sure , but I think I saw a picture of you in some videogame magazine my boyfriend had . You 're , like , the shit .
GABRIEL: No .
SIERRA: You 're like the Quentin Tarantino of that world . A videogame God .
GABRIEL: Not really .
SIERRA: Fine .
GABRIEL: You seriously recognized me off of one photo ?
SIERRA: I thought you were kinda hot . Considering .
GABRIEL: Considering.. ?
SIERRA: Within the subset of videogame people .
GABRIEL: Okay .
SIERRA: I was n't masturbating to you picture or anything .
GABRIEL: Well , I guess I 'm flattered .
SIERRA: You should be . I 'm stingy with compliments .
GABRIEL: So your boyfriend plays videogames ?
SIERRA: Ex-boyfriend . And yes . Way too many . He used to play Evercrack ack in the day , but yours , well , that was likewhat 's worse than crack ?
GABRIEL: Super-crack ?
SIERRA: Sure . He was this orc witch docto guy .
GABRIEL: Shaman ?
SIERRA: Yeah . At one point he was spending like , 40 hours a week gathering `` thunderleaf '' or whatever .
GABRIEL: You had an account ?
SIERRA: I was part of your world , and you did n't even know it .
GABRIEL: Sorry .
SIERRA: You can make it up to me .
MAN'S VOICE: I have five seasons mapped out , and though it sucks , either you go away , or the show goes . I had to make a decision , and that 's the decision I made . I 'm sorry .
SIERRA: So you play a lot of characters at once ?
GABRIEL: A couple . Most people do .
SIERRA: You 're not most people . You created the world . You know all the secret codes .
GABRIEL: What , like ` God mode ' ?
SIERRA: That 's what you call it ?
GABRIEL: That 's when you have all the powers , and you ca n't be killed . It 's fine when you 're designing , ut it 's really boring to play . A game is n't fun unless there are ules .
SIERRA: And you make the rules .
GABRIEL: Yes I do . I mean , you want to give everyone freedom , but they ca n't handle it . Half your players are teenage boys , and it 's like they 're programmed to be destructive .
SIERRA: Do you think I 'm pretty ? She stops , turning to face him .
GABRIEL: What ?
SIERRA: Do you think I 'm hot ? On a purely physical level .
GABRIEL: Sure . He drinks .
SIERRA: That 's a rave .
GABRIEL: Well , I do n't know why you 're asking .
SIERRA: My ex-boyfriend , the orc , he says , `` What I like about you is that you 're not so hot that I 'm afraid of losing you . ''
GABRIEL: So where 's the orc now ?
SIERRA: He 's dead . I spiked his wate ottle with a massive quantity of GHB . He hallucinated , went into convulsions and died .
GABRIEL: Remind me not to piss you off , Sarah .
SIERRA: Sierra .
GABRIEL: Sorry .
SIERRA: And what makes you think you have n't pissed me off already ? She smiles , keeps walking .
MARY: How are you doing , kiddo ? Noelle does n't look up .
NOELLE: He 's not coming back .
MARY: How could you
IX: He 's sweating a lot .
GABRIEL: Am I crazy , or is it getting hotter ?
SIERRA: Oh , you 're crazy .
GABRIEL: I have a wife . And a daughter . They 're waiting for me .
SIERRA: Where are they ?
GABRIEL: Back at the car .
SIERRA: I mean , which direction ?
GABRIEL: They 're back
SIERRA: Face it , G. You do n't know where they are . You do n't know where you are . We 've been walking in circles for an hour .
GABRIEL: Where 's your car ?
SIERRA: There is no car . That was all a `` pretense , '' I guess . An excuse to get you alone .
GABRIEL: What 's happening ?
SIERRA: I 'm sorry it had to come this , G. But it 'll all be over soon .
GABRIEL: You 're trying to kill me .
SIERRA: No ! No . This is n't a murder . It 's an intervention .
SUSAN: I had to get you away from her . She was holding you back . You had to give her up .
GAVIN: Melissa ?
SARAH: I can you out of here . But you have to trust me .
SUSAN: Do you feel like a man ? You 're not .
SIERRA: That 's right . Just let it go . Let it go .
GABRIEL: Why are you doing this ?
SIERRA: You did it to yourself . Admitting that is the first step .
OCTAVIA: Because you forgot who you were .
AGITATED MAN: You forgot this was n't real .
OCTAVIA: You ca n't think it with human thoughts .
MARGARET: You could destroy the world with a single thought . Do n't , incidentally . Just file that away . But the truth is , you hold all the cards every church , every candle , every sacrifice that 's for you . When people pray , they 're not praying because they want this thing or that thing . They just do n't want to be forgotten .
MARY: Noelle ? Noelle !
GABRIEL: Maybe if I just cut back , did n't get so involved
SIERRA: We both know that 'll never work . Next week , you 'll be back here edesigning the pinecones . You have to quit cold-turkey .
GABRIEL: I ca n't .
SIERRA: You can . But I ca n't force you to leave . You have to want it .
MARY: Noelle ! Noelle !
GABRIEL: She 's here .
MARY: Everything okay ?
GABRIEL: Absolutely . Let 's go home .
MARY: You need to go , do n't you ?
GABRIEL: No . I can stay .
MARY: How long ? Forever ? Every day , you 'd know what you were missing . He smiles , a little .
GABRIEL: Worst-case scenario ? Spontaneous disintegration into a fiery void . Oblivio accebit . The end of everything .
MARY: That 's all ? Both smile .
GABRIEL: That probably would n't happen . The asic structure of the universe should hold . I guess I 'm just worried about the human factor . You guys kill each other a lot .
MARY: In fairness , that 's usually in you name . Plus we 've gotten much more efficient at it . A beat .
GABRIEL: I like this world . I like my life , here , with you and Noelle
MARY: But it 's not real . I 'm not really your wife , you 're not really my husband . On some level , it 's all pretend .
GABRIEL: It 's not pretend . There 's a reason you were there , in every version . You were my sister , my wife , my est friend
MARY: That 's a little creepy .
GABRIEL: I wanted you close . In one version , I even told you . I warned you that some day they might come for me , and

TATTOO MASTER: The irezumi does not hide the skin , the tattoo reveals the nature of the man and illuminates the four noble professions in the Book of Five Rings the Warrior , the Artist , the Merchant , and the farmer . If there is a conflict etween the needle and the skin , etween the mark and the man , then perhaps the path you have chosen is not the path for which you are suited .

Shigeaki answered that he did n't know what the prosecutor was talking about . The question was never brought up again . But what pinged for me was the amount- the exact same amount umored to be paid to the Hattori Clan for the assassination of Lord Sanda .
MASLOW: So you start to wonder , in this ever changing world , if the cost of a man 's life has remained constant .

MANAGER: Is there anything I can do for you , monsieur ?
BULJANOFF: No , no .
MANAGER: Yes , monsieur ?
IRANOFF: Just looking around .
KOPALSKI: Comrades , why should we lie to each other ? It 's wonderful .
IRANOFF: Let 's be honest . Have we anything like it in Russia ?
ALL THREE: No , no , no .
IRANOFF: Can you imagine what the beds would e in a hotel like that ?
KOPALSKI: They tell me when you ring once the valet comes in ; when you ring twice you get the waiter ; and do you know what happens when you ring three times ? A maid comes in a French maid .
IRANOFF: Comrades , if we ring nine times let 's go in .
BULJANOFF: Just a minute just a minute I have nothing against the idea but I still say let 's go back to the Hotel Terminus . Moscow made our reservations there , we are on an official mission , and we have no right to change the orders of our superior .
IRANOFF: Where is your courage , Comrade Buljanoff ?
KOPALSKI: Are you the Buljanoff who fought on the barricades ? And now you are afraid to take a room with a bath ?
BULJANOFF: I do n't want to go to Siberia . Iranoff and Kopalski follow him reluctantly .
IRANOFF: I do n't want to go to the Hotel Terminus .
KOPALSKI: If Lenin were alive he would say , `` Buljanoff , Comrade , for once in your life you 're in Paris . Do n't be a fool . Go in there and ring three times . ''
IRANOFF: He would n't say that . What he would say is `` Buljanoff , you ca n't afford to live in a cheap hotel . Does n't the prestige of the Bolsheviks mean anything to you ? Do you want to live in a hotel where you press for the hot water and cold water comes and when you press for the cold wate nothing comes out at all ? Phooey , Buljanoff ! ''
BULJANOFF: I still say our place is with the common people , but who am I to contradict Lenin ? Let 's go in . All three start to leave the taxi , as we
KOPALSKI: Are you the manager ?
MANAGER: Yes .
KOPALSKI: Pardon me for introducing Comrade Iranoff , member of the Russian Board of Trade .
MANAGER: Monsieur .
IRANOFF: This is Comrade Kopalski .
MANAGER: Monsieur .
BULJANOFF: I am Comrade Buljanoff .
MANAGER: Monsieur .
BULJANOFF: May I ask how much your rooms are ?
MANAGER: Well , gentlemen , I 'm afraid our rates are rather high .
BULJANOFF: Why should you be afraid ?
MANAGER: I might be able to accommodate you . Is there some more luggage ?
IRANOFF: Oh , yes , but have you a safe here ig enough to hold this ?
MANAGER: I 'm afraid we have no boxes of that size in our vault , but there is one suite with a private safe
IRANOFF: That 's even better .
MANAGER: But , gentlemen , I am afraid
BULJANOFF: He 's always afraid .
MANAGER: I just wanted to explain . The apartment may suit your convenience ut I doubt that it will fit you convictions . It 's the Royal Suite .
BULJANOFF: Royal Suite ! Just a minute .
IRANOFF: We 'll just say we had to take it on account of the safe . That 's a perfect excuse . There was no other safe big enough .
BULJANOFF: Of course , we could take out the pieces and distribute them in three or four boxes in the vault and take a small room . That 's an idea , is n't it ?
IRANOFF: Yes , it 's an idea , but who says we have to have an idea ?
BOTH: That 's right that 's right .
BULJANOFF: Give us the Royal Suite .
KOPALSKI'S VOICE: Will you connect me with Mercier yes , the jeweler
KOPALSKI: I want to speak with Monsieur Mercie personally Hello , Monsieur Mercier ? This is Kopalski of the Russian Board of Trade . We arrived this morning Thank you .
KOPALSKI'S VOICE: Yes , everything is here . The necklace too . All fourteen pieces What ? No , Monsieur Mercier , the court jewels of the Duchess Swana consisted of fourteen pieces . Why do n't you check on that ? Naturally , we have all the necessary credentials . As the voice continues , we
RAKONIN: Eight Rue de Chalon .
MAID: Good morning , Count .
LEON: Good morning .
MAID: Her Highness is still dressing .
LEON: That 's all right .
SWANA: Hello , Leon !
LEON: Good morning , Swana .
SWANA: It 's really a wretched morning wretched . I ca n't get myself right . I wanted to look mellow and I look ittle . My face does n't compose well all highlights how can I dim myself down , Leon ? Suggest something . I am so bored with this face . I wish I had someone else 's face . Whose face would you have if you had your choice ? Oh , well , I guess one gets the face one deserves .
LEON: Your conversation has one marvelous advantage , Swana . However many questions you ask you never expect an answer .
SWANA: Do n't you find that restful ? Why did n't you come last night ?
LEON: Darling , I was busy looking out fo your interests .
SWANA: Did you win ?
LEON: We can forget horse racing , roulette , the stock market our worries are over ! You remember that platinum watch with the diamond numbers ? You will be in a position to give it to me .
SWANA: Oh , Leon , you are so good to me .
LEON: We can be rich if you say the word . I had dinner with the Guizots last night .
SWANA: Those newspaper people ?
LEON: You 'd be surprised how many nice people dine with the Guizots .
SWANA: What a gruesome proof of the powe of the press !
LEON: Now listen , Swana I sold Monsieu Guizot the idea of publishing you memoirs in the Gazette Parisienne . `` The Life and Loves of the Grand Duchess Swana of Russia '' !
SWANA: Oh , Leon !
LEON: Sweetheart , we wo n't have to bothe about our future if you are willing to raffle off your past !
SWANA: Was it for this that I refused to endorse Dr. Bertrand 's Mouthwash ? I could have made a little fortune by saying that the Vincent Vacuum Cleane was the only vacuum cleaner eve used by the Romanoffs and now you want them to smear my life 's secrets over the front page of a tabloid ?
LEON: I understand how you feel , but there is a limit to everything , particularly pride and dignity . They are willing to pay any price ! They have a circulation of two million !
SWANA: Imagine two million clerks and shop girls peeking into my life for a sou ! Think of my lovely life being wrapped around cheese and blood sausages ! I can see a big grease spot in the midst of my most intimate moments !
LEON: Well , I am the last person to persuade you , but do n't do it blindly if this is your decision , you must be prepared to face the consequences I will have to go to work .
SWANA: My little Volga boatman ! Stop threatening ! I do n't deserve this . Are you my little Volga boatman ?
LEON: Now , Swana
SWANA: First tell me , are you my little Volga boatman ?
LEON: Yes , I 'm your little Volga boatman .
SWANA: Well two million readers I know exactly what they want . Chapte One `` A Childhood behind Golden Bars . Lovely Little Princess Plays with Rasputin 's Beard . ''
LEON: I 've got one chapter Guizot thinks is terrific . `` Caviar and Blood . '' Swana escapes over the ice !
SWANA: A couple of bloodhounds and we have Uncle Tom 's Cabin .
LEON: Darling , this would be wonderful ! Just once were n't you attacked by a Bolshevik ?
SWANA: Was I ? No not by a Bolshevik !
LEON: Too bad ! Brings our price down ten thousand francs ! There is a knock on the door .
SWANA: Come in . The Maid enters .
MAID: Count Rakonin asks the privilege of a few words , Your Highness .
LEON: Count Rakonin ?
SWANA: He 's a waiter at the Clarence , poo devil . You know him .
LEON: Oh , yes .
SWANA: Tell him I wo n't be able to see him for a half an hour .
MAID: The Count says if it could be as soon as possible . It is luncheon time and he is just between courses .
RAKONIN: Your Highness .
SWANA: How do you do , my friend .
RAKONIN: Your Highness , forgive this intrusion , ut
SWANA: What is it , Rakonin ? Did you lose your job ?
RAKONIN: No , madame , something of the utmost importance it concerns your jewels .
SWANA: My jewels ? !
RAKONIN: I remember one birthday of His Majesty , our beloved Czar I had the honor of being on guard at the summer palace I still see you ending before His Majesty You wore your diadem and a necklace your face seemed to be lighted by the jewels .
SWANA: Why do you bring this up after so many years ?
RAKONIN: They are here ! Your jewels ! Here in Paris !
SWANA: Alexis ! Do you know what you are saying ?
RAKONIN: This morning three Soviet agents arrived . I overheard a telephone conversation with Mercier , the jeweler . Your Highness , they are going to sell them !
LEON: Did I hear something about jewels ?
SWANA: Rakonin , bless him , has given me the most amazing news !
RAKONIN: I am sorry I have to leave .
SWANA: Thank you so much , my friend . I will get in touch with you . Count Rakonin leaves .
LEON: What does he say ?
SWANA: Shhh ! But how can there be a question ? Are you my lawyer or theirs ? All ight , I 'll let you know !
LEON: What did he say ?
SWANA: It looks pretty hopeless there may be a chance that 's all The French Government has recognized Soviet Russia and he doubts that they will risk a war for my poo sake . He might be able to make up some kind of a case but it would cost money , money , money ! That 's all they are interested in those lawyers !
LEON: Darling , calm down . Why do you need a lawyer ? Have n't you your little Volga boatman ?
MERCIER: Very good superb excellent it would be foolish to belittle the quality of the merchandise but you terms are impossible . My counteroffe is the absolute maximum .
KOPALSKI: But , Monsieur Mercier
MERCIER: Gentlemen , I 'll let you in on a little secret we are only undertaking this deal for the prestige involved , and , quite frankly , we are expecting to take a loss .
IRANOFF: Capitalistic methods
BULJANOFF: They accumulate millions by taking loss after loss . The telephone rings .
MERCIER: I assure you no one else could meet the figure named by my syndicate at least under the present economic conditions .
KOPALSKI: We can wait .
IRANOFF: Do we give the impression of people who are pressed for money ?
MERCIER: Yes . Gentlemen let 's put our cards face down . Right now there is a Russian commission in New York trying to sell fifteen Rembrandts . There is another in London mortgaging the oil fields in Baku . You need money and you need it quickly . I think my offe is fair and does not even take advantage of your situation .
KOPALSKI: Just a minute . The Three Russians step to one side .
IRANOFF: He 's cutting our throat
BULJANOFF: But what can we do ? We have to accept .
KOPALSKI: Comrades ! Comrades ! Do n't let 's give in so quickly . After all we have to uphold the prestige of Russia .
BULJANOFF: All right , let 's uphold it for anothe ten minutes .
IRANOFF: We do n't want to be disturbed .
LEON: My name is Count d'Algout . I telephoned .
IRANOFF: If you want to see us you must come later .
LEON: I just want a word with Monsieu Mercier .
IRANOFF: But you ca n't
LEON: Monsieur Mercier . May I introduce myself ? I am Count Leon d'Algout . I think I had the pleasure of meeting you in your beautiful shop . I was admiring a platinum watch with diamond numbers .
MERCIER: Oh , yes , yes
LEON: Glorious , are n't they ?
KOPALSKI: Now , monsieur , you have no right
LEON: Just a moment . I hope you have n't closed this deal , Monsieur Mercier . It might bring you into serious difficulties .
IRANOFF: You know , Monsieur Mercier , this is all non-sense .
KOPALSKI: These may have been the jewels of the Duchess Swana , but , like all private property , they were confiscated by the State .
LEON: We 'll leave the problem of thei ownership to the French courts . Meanwhile I have filed a petition for an injunction to prohibit you from either selling or removing the jewels . Here is a copy .
MERCIER: Thank you . Gentlemen , this introduces a new element into our negotiations . Until this claim is completely settled
KOPALSKI: We can call our ambassador .
IRANOFF: I give you my word ! They were confiscated legally !
MERCIER: Please try to understand my position . I am not with-drawing . My offer stands and as soon as you produce a clea title , approved by the French courts , the deal is settled . Until then , good day .
LEON: I hope you will forgive me , Monsieu Mercier .
MERCIER: On the contrary . I consider myself very lucky . Good day . He bows .
LEON: Good day , monsieur .
IRANOFF: Get out of here !
LEON: Do n't look so gloomy , gentlemen . All is not lost . You may have a chance .
KOPALSKI: We may have a chance .
LEON: Yes a very slim one . I want to be fair . I do n't deny that you might make out some kind of a case .
KOPALSKI: We have n't anything to discuss with you . We 'll talk to a lawyer !
LEON: All right go ahead you talk to the lawyer and I 'll talk to the judge !
IRANOFF: That wo n't help you ! You ca n't intimidate us !
KOPALSKI: Soviet Russia will put all its might ehind this case .
BULJANOFF: You think because you represent the former Duchess
LEON: The Duchess
BULJANOFF: The former Duchess !
LEON: In any case , gentlemen , a charming , eautiful , exquisite woman . I warn you , if this case comes to trial it will be before a French court , and when the Duchess takes the stand
IRANOFF: All right , go ahead , get her on the witness stand ! What can she say ?
LEON: But how will she look ? The fashions this spring are very becoming to her . Gentlemen , the judge will be French , the jury will be French , everybody in that courtroom will be French . Have you ever seen a French court when a beautiful woman sits on the witness stand and lifts her skirt a little ? You sit down and pull up your pants and where will it get you ?
IRANOFF: I suppose you expect us to hand ove the jewels ?
LEON: Oh , no , no . I am not a highwayman , I 'm just a nuisance . All I 'm trying to do is make things as difficult as possible .
BULJANOFF: Not that we are giving in one inch , ut tell us what is in your mind ?
LEON: Well , gentlemen , how about my proposition ?
IRANOFF: What proposition ?
LEON: I just said let 's have a little lunch . Room service .
KOPALSKI: Yes , Leon
IRANOFF: What is it , my boy ?
LEON: About this telegram to Moscow . Why should you bother ? I 'll write it fo you .
BULJANOFF: Leon Leonitchka Why are you so good to us ?
IRANOFF: Leon , my little boy .
KOPALSKI: Oh , Leon , you are so good .
LEON: What 's the name of that Commissar on the Board of Trade ?
IRANOFF: Razinin .
LEON: Razinin , Board of Trade , Moscow .
KOPALSKI: You would n't like Razinin .
BULJANOFF: He 's a bad man . Sends people to Siberia !
IRANOFF: We do n't like Razinin .
BULJANOFF: We like you , Leon do n't we like Leon ? The others join him and kiss Leon .
LEON: How does this strike you ? Commissa Razinin , Board of Trade , Moscow . Unexpected situation here . Duchess Swana in Paris claims jewels , and has already brought injunction against sale or removal . After long and careful study we suggest in the interest of our beloved country a fifty-fifty settlement as best solution . Iranoff , Buljanoff , and Kopalski .
KOPALSKI: If we say that , Leon we 'll be sent to Siberia !
IRANOFF: And if we have to go to Siberia
LEON: I 'll send you a muff .
BULJANOFF: Oh , why are you so good to us ?
LEON: Take this telegram to the telegraph office at once !
RAKONIN: Yes , monsieur . He leaves the room .
LADY LAVENHAM: Good afternoon , messieurs , mes Comrades .
KOPALSKI: And how is Lord Lavenham ?
BULJANOFF: and little Lady Beatrice ?
LADY LAVENHAM: Very well . Did fortune favor you at the races ?
IRANOFF: Comme ci , comme ca .
LADY LAVENHAM: I understand nothing to write home about .
BULJANOFF: Who wants to write home about it ?
LADY LAVENHAM: It 's just a saying . How about joining us Saturday night for dinner ? We 're having a few friends .
KOPALSKI: Are we free , Buljanoff ?
BULJANOFF: Possibly .
IRANOFF: We 'll manage .
LADY LAVENHAM: Then let 's say at nine .
BULJANOFF: Black tie or white tie ?
LADY LAVENHAM: Oh , let 's make it white .
BULJANOFF: Certainly !
LADY LAVENHAM: Au revoir .
BULJANOFF: Nice people .
IRANOFF: Yes , Leon What is it , Leon ? You ca n't hurry such things You must give Moscow a little time There 's nothing we can do about it why do n't you drop in later ? Au revoir He steps into the living room .
BULJANOFF: Misha ! Misha !
IRANOFF: What is it ?
BULJANOFF: A telegram from Moscow ! It must have een here all day !
KOPALSKI: Halt negotiations immediately . Envoy extraordinary arrives Thursday six ten with full power . Your authority cancelled herewith . Razinin .
IRANOFF: It is Thursday !
BULJANOFF: It 's six o'clock already ! They rush into the bedroom .
KOPALSKI: I always said it would be Siberia !
IRANOFF: A Special Envoy is coming from Moscow . He 'll occupy the Royal Suite . Move our things to the smallest room you 've got .
MANAGER: Yes , monsieur .
IRANOFF: Right away instantly !
KOPALSKI: How can you find somebody without knowing what he looks like ?
IRANOFF: That must be the one !
BULJANOFF: Yes , he looks like a comrade !
KOPALSKI: No , that 's not him
BULJANOFF: Positively not !
NINOTCHKA: I am looking for Michael Simonovitch Iranoff .
IRANOFF: I am Michael Simonovitch Iranoff .
NINOTCHKA: I am Nina Ivanovna Yakushova , Envoy Extraordinary , acting under direct orders of Comrade Commissar Razinin . Present me to your colleagues .
IRANOFF: Comrade Buljanoff
NINOTCHKA: Comrade .
IRANOFF: Comrade Kopalski
NINOTCHKA: Comrade .
IRANOFF: What a charming idea for Moscow to surprise us with a lady comrade .
KOPALSKI: If we had known we would have greeted you with flowers .
NINOTCHKA: Do n't make an issue of my womanhood . We are here for work all of us . Let 's not waste time . Shall we go ?
IRANOFF: Porter ! A Porter steps up to them .
PORTER: Here , please
NINOTCHKA: What do you want ?
PORTER: May I have your bags , madame ?
NINOTCHKA: Why ?
KOPALSKI: He is a porter . He wants to carry them .
NINOTCHKA: Why ? Why should you carry othe people 's bags ?
PORTER: Well that 's my business , madame .
NINOTCHKA: That 's no business that 's a social injustice .
PORTER: That depends on the tip .
KOPALSKI: Allow me , Comrade .
NINOTCHKA: No , thank you .
BULJANOFF: How are things in Moscow ?
NINOTCHKA: Very good . The last mass trials were a great success . There are going to e fewer but better Russians .
KOPALSKI: It 's a hat , Comrade , a woman 's hat . Ninotchka shakes her head .
NINOTCHKA: Tsk , tsk , tsk , how can such a civilization survive which permits women to put things like that on their heads . It wo n't be long now , Comrades .
BULJANOFF: This is the apartment we have reserved for you , Comrade Yakushova . I hope you like it .
NINOTCHKA: Which part of the room is mine ?
IRANOFF: You see it is a little different here . They do n't rent rooms in pieces . We had to take the whole suite .
NINOTCHKA: How much does this cost ?
IRANOFF: Two thousand francs .
NINOTCHKA: A week ?
IRANOFF: A day .
NINOTCHKA: Do you know how much a cow costs , Comrade Iranoff ?
IRANOFF: A cow ?
NINOTCHKA: Two thousand francs . If I stay here a week I will cost the Russian people seven cows . Who am I to cost the Russian people seven cows ?
BULJANOFF: We had to take it on account of the safe .
IRANOFF: For ourselves we are much happie now since we moved to a little room next to the servants ' quarters .
NINOTCHKA: I am ashamed to put the picture of Lenin in a room like this . Comrades , your telegram was received with great disfavor in Moscow .
KOPALSKI: We did our best , Comrade .
NINOTCHKA: I hope so for your sake . Let us examine the case . What does the lawyer say ?
BULJANOFF: Which lawyer ?
NINOTCHKA: You did n't get legal advice ?
BULJANOFF: We did n't want to get mixed up with lawyers . They are very expensive here . If you just say hello to a lawyer well , there goes anothe cow .
KOPALSKI: We dealt directly with the epresentative of the Grand Duchess . I am sure if we call him he will give you a very clear picture .
NINOTCHKA: I will not repeat your mistake . I will have no dealings with the Grand Duchess nor her representative .
BULJANOFF: Yes , Comrade ?
NINOTCHKA: Do you spell Buljanoff with one o two f 's ?
BULJANOFF: With two f 's , if you please .
NINOTCHKA: Will you send me some cigarettes , please ? Comrades , I am not in a position to pass final judgment but at best you have been careless in your duty to the State . You were entrusted with more than a mere sale of jewelry . Why are we peddling our precious possessions to the world at this time ? Our next year 's crop is in danger and you know it . Unless we can get foreign currency to buy tractors there will not be enough bread for our people . And you three comrades
KOPALSKI: We did it with the best intentions
NINOTCHKA: We can not feed the Russian people on your intentions . Fifty per cent to a so-called Duchess ! Half of every loaf of bread to our enemy ! Comrade Kopalski , go at once to our Embassy and get the address of the best lawye in Paris .
KOPALSKI: Yes , Comrade .
NINOTCHKA: You , Comrade Iranoff , go to the Public Library and get me the section of the Civil Code on property .
BULJANOFF: Is there anything I can do , Comrade ?
NINOTCHKA: You might get me an accurate map of Paris . I want to use my spare time to inspect the public utilities and make a study of all outstanding technical achievements in the city .
BULJANOFF: Yes , Comrade . The buzzer rings .
NINOTCHKA: Come in . The three Cigarette Girls enter .
CIGARETTE GIRLS: Hello ! Hello ! Cigarettes ?
NINOTCHKA: Comrades , you seem to have been smoking a lot .
DESK CLERK: Desk yes , Monsieur Kopalski you are expecting Count d'Algout uh huh but he is not to go to the Royal Suite under any circumstances . He should go to your new room , 985 ? Thank you , monsieur .
NINOTCHKA: Good evening . She exits out the door .
LEON: Me ?
NINOTCHKA: Yes . Could you give me some information ?
LEON: Gladly .
NINOTCHKA: How long do we have to wait here ?
LEON: Well until the policeman whistles again .
NINOTCHKA: At what intervals does he whistle ?
LEON: What ?
NINOTCHKA: How many minutes between the first and second whistle ?
LEON: That 's funny . It 's interesting . I never gave it a thought before .
NINOTCHKA: Have you never been caught in a similar situation ?
LEON: Have I ? Do you know when I come to think about it it 's staggering . If I add it all up I must have spent years waiting for signals . Imagine ! An important part of my life wasted etween whistles .
NINOTCHKA: In other words you do n't know .
LEON: No .
NINOTCHKA: Thank you .
LEON: You 're welcome .
NINOTCHKA: You might hold this for me .
LEON: Love to .
NINOTCHKA: Correct me if I am wrong We are facing north , are n't we ?
LEON: Facing north I 'd hate to commit myself without my compass Pardon me are you an explorer ?
NINOTCHKA: No I am looking for the Eiffel Tower .
LEON: Is that thing lost again ? Listen if you are interested in a view
NINOTCHKA: I am interested in the Eiffel Towe from a technical standpoint .
LEON: Technical I could n't help you from that angle . You see , a real Parisian only goes to the top of the tower in moments of despair to jump off .
NINOTCHKA: How long does it take a man to land ?
LEON: Now , is n't that too bad ! The last time I jumped I forgot to clock it ! Let me see Eiffel Tower You finger , please .
NINOTCHKA: Why do you need my finger ?
LEON: Bad manners to point with your own Here the Eiffel Tower .
NINOTCHKA: And where are we ?
LEON: Here here we are here you are and here I am feel it ?
NINOTCHKA: I am interested only in the shortest distance between these two points . Must you flirt ?
LEON: I do n't have to but I find it natural .
NINOTCHKA: Suppress it .
LEON: I 'll try . Ninotchka starts to fold her map .
NINOTCHKA: For my own information would you call your approach toward me typical of the local morale ?
LEON: Madame , it is that kind of approach which has made Paris what it is .
NINOTCHKA: You are very sure of yourself , are n't you ?
LEON: Nothing has occurred recently to shake my confidence .
NINOTCHKA: I have heard of the arrogant male in capitalistic society . It is having a superior earning power that makes you like that .
LEON: A Russian ! I love Russians ! Comrade I have been fascinated by your Five- Year Plan for the past fifteen years !
NINOTCHKA: Your type will soon be extinct .
ATTENDANT: You do n't have to worry . The thing is safe .
NINOTCHKA: I am not afraid I want to know
LEON: The foundation is one hundred and forty-one yards square I hope you 'll forgive me but I thought you 'd
NINOTCHKA: Go ahead .
LEON: Four massive piers of masonry are sunk to a depth of forty-six feet on the side of the Seine , and twenty- nine and one-half feet on the othe side . The girders of interlaced iron- work which stay the structure have an inclination of fifty-fou degrees
NINOTCHKA: That 's a strange angle .
LEON: Yes , very strange .
NINOTCHKA: You gave me some very valuable information . Thank you .
LEON: And thank you for getting me up here . I 've never seen this before . Beautiful , is n't it ?
NINOTCHKA: Yes , it is .
LEON: I 'm glad I saw it before becoming extinct .
NINOTCHKA: Do not misunderstand me . I do not hold your frivolity against you . As basic material you might not be ad , but you are the unfortunate product of a doomed culture . I feel sorry for you .
LEON: You must admit that this doomed old civilization sparkles It glitters !
NINOTCHKA: I do not deny its beauty , but it is a waste of electricity .
LEON: What a city ! There are the Grands Boulevards blasted out of the heart of the old streets . The Arc de Triomphe made to greet Napoleon 's army . The Opera ! And Montmartre Montparnasse La Bohème and now I 'll show you the greatest attraction ! It will cost me a franc but it is worth it . The most wonderful spot in all Paris unique ! Here , look . What do you see ?
NINOTCHKA: I see a house that looks like any other house . What 's remarkable about it ?
LEON: It 's not the structure but the spirit which dwells within . There are three ooms and a kitchenette dedicated to hospitality .
NINOTCHKA: So that is your house ?
LEON: Well , let 's say I live in it . Such a pleasant place all kinds of comfort , easy to reach , close to street car , bus , and subway
NINOTCHKA: Does that mean that you want me to go there ?
LEON: Please do n't misunderstand me
NINOTCHKA: Then you do n't want me to go there .
LEON: Now I did n't say that either naturally nothing would please me more .
NINOTCHKA: Then why do n't we go ? You might be an interesting subject of study .
LEON: I will do my best . They walk toward the elevator as we
GASTON: No Count d'Algout is still out . Yes , as soon as he returns I 'll tell him . Yes I 'll tell him Monsieu Buljanoff .
LEON: Good evening , Gaston .
GASTON: Good evening , Monsieur .
NINOTCHKA: Is this what you call the `` butler '' ?
LEON: Yes .
NINOTCHKA: Good evening , comrade . This man is horribly old . You should not make him work .
LEON: He takes good care of that .
NINOTCHKA: He looks sad . Do you whip him ?
LEON: No , though the mere thought makes my mouth water .
NINOTCHKA: The day will come when you will be free . Go to bed , little father . We want to be alone .
GASTON: Count d'Algout , there have been several telephone
LEON: Go to bed .
NINOTCHKA: Thank you . I 've had all the calories necessary for today .
LEON: We take off our hat and coat . We sit down we make ourselves comfortable . We adjust ourselves to the prospect of a most enjoyable evening . We look at each other . We smile . Well we do n't smile . How about some music ?
NINOTCHKA: Is that customary ?
LEON: It helps . It has ever since King David wooed Bathsheba with the harp . As I am not so fortunate as to have my harp at hand , I shall turn on the adio .
NINOTCHKA: I should say this room is eighteen y twenty-five .
LEON: Not too big and not too small . What I 'd call the typical room of an average man . Or shall we say a little above average . Now if there are any special aspects you wish to study I have nothing to conceal . Just look around . That 's my desk . Those are my ooks , and here am I . Where shall we egin ?
NINOTCHKA: I will start with you .
LEON: That 's great . I 'm thirty-five years old . Just over six feet tall . I weigh a hundred and eighty-two pounds stripped .
NINOTCHKA: And what is your profession ?
LEON: Keeping my body fit , keeping my mind alert , keeping my landlord appeased . That 's a full-time job .
NINOTCHKA: And what do you do for mankind ?
LEON: For mankind not a thing fo womankind the record is not quite so leak .
NINOTCHKA: You are something we do not have in Russia .
LEON: Thank you . Thank you .
NINOTCHKA: That is why I believe in the future of my country .
LEON: I begin to believe in it myself since I 've met you . I still do n't know what to make of it . It confuses me , it frightens me a little , but it fascinates me , Ninotchka .
NINOTCHKA: You pronounce it incorrectly . Ni- notchka .
LEON: Ni-notchka .
NINOTCHKA: That is correct .
LEON: Ninotchka , do you like me just a little bit ?
NINOTCHKA: Your general appearance is not distasteful .
LEON: Thank you .
NINOTCHKA: Look at me . The whites of your eyes are clear . Your cornea is excellent .
LEON: Your cornea is terrific . Tell me you 're so expert on things can it e that I 'm falling in love with you ?
NINOTCHKA: You are bringing in wrong values . Love is a romantic designation for a most ordinary biological , or shall we say chemical , process . A lot of nonsense is talked and written about it .
LEON: Oh , I see . What do you use instead ?
NINOTCHKA: I acknowledge the existence of a natural impulse common to all .
LEON: What can I possibly do to encourage such an impulse in you ?
NINOTCHKA: You do n't have to do a thing . Chemically we are already quite sympathetic .
LEON: You 're the most improbable creature I 've ever met in my life , Ninotchka , Ninotchka
NINOTCHKA: You repeat yourself .
LEON: I 'd like to say it a thousand times .
NINOTCHKA: Do n't do it , please .
LEON: I 'm at a loss , Ninotchka . You must forgive me if I appear a little old- fashioned . After all , I 'm just a poor bourgeois .
NINOTCHKA: It 's never too late to change . I used to belong to the petty ourgeoisie myself . My father and mother wanted me to stay and work on the farm , but I preferred the bayonet .
LEON: The bayonet ? Did you really ?
NINOTCHKA: I was wounded before Warsaw .
LEON: Wounded ? How ?
NINOTCHKA: I was a sergeant in the Third Cavalry Brigade . Would you like to see my wound ?
LEON: I 'd love to . Tsk , tsk , tsk .
NINOTCHKA: A Polish lancer . I was sixteen .
LEON: Poor Ninotchka . Poor , poor Ninotchka .
NINOTCHKA: Do n't pity me . Pity the Polish lancer . After all , I 'm alive .
LEON: What kind of a girl are you , anyway ?
NINOTCHKA: Just what you see . A tiny cog in the great wheel of evolution .
LEON: You 're the most adorable cog I eve saw in my life . Ninotchka , Cogitska , let me confess something . Never did I dream I could feel like this toward a sergeant . A clock strikes .
NINOTCHKA: It 's twelve o'clock .
LEON: It 's midnight . One half of Paris is making love to the other half . Look at the clock . One hand has met the other hand . They kiss . Is n't that wonderful ?
NINOTCHKA: That 's the way a clock works . There 's nothing wonderful about it . You merely feel you must put yourself in a omantic mood to add to you exhilaration .
LEON: I ca n't possibly think of a bette eason .
NINOTCHKA: It 's false sentimentality .
LEON: You analyze everything out of existence . You analyze me out of existence . I wo n't let you . Love is not so simple . Ninotchka , Ninotchka , why do doves bill and coo ? Why do snails , coldest of all creatures , circle interminably around each other ? Why do moths fly hundreds of miles to find their mates ? Why do flowers open their petals ? Oh , Ninotchka , Ninotchka , surely you feel some slight symptom of the divine passion a general warmth in the palms of you hands a strange heaviness in you limbs a burning of the lips that is not thirst but a thousand times more tantalizing , more exalting , than thirst ?
NINOTCHKA: You are very talkative .
LEON: Was that talkative ?
NINOTCHKA: No , that was restful . Again . Leon kisses her again .
LEON: Oh , my barbaric Ninotchka . My impossible , unromantic , statistical The telephone rings .
NINOTCHKA: The telephone is ringing .
LEON: Oh , let it ring .
NINOTCHKA: But one of your friends may be in need of you . You must answer . Leon exits out of shot to answer telephone .
LEON: Hello ? Yes I 'm sorry but I could n't make it . I ran into a friend from the army What ? The deal is off ! Are you crazy , Buljanoff ?
NINOTCHKA: I must go .
LEON: Ninotchka , or shall I say Special Envoy Yakushova
NINOTCHKA: Let 's forget that we ever met .
LEON: I have a better suggestion . Let 's forget that the telephone ever rang . I never heard that you are Yakushova you are Ninotchka my Ninotchka
NINOTCHKA: I was sent here by my country to fight you .
LEON: All right , fight me , fight me as much as you want , but fight me tomorrow morning ! There 's nothing sweeter than sharing a secret with a itter enemy .
NINOTCHKA: As a representative of Moscow
LEON: Tonight let 's not represent anybody ut ourselves .
NINOTCHKA: It is out of the question . If you wish to approach me
LEON: You know I want to
NINOTCHKA: Then do it through my lawyer !
LEON: Ninotchka , you ca n't walk out like this I 'm crazy about you , and I thought I 'd made an impression on you . You liked the white of my eye .
NINOTCHKA: I must go . She starts for the door .
LEON: But , Ninotchka , I held you in my arms . You kissed me !
NINOTCHKA: I kissed the Polish lancer too efore he died . As she goes out , we
GASTON: Good morning , Your Highness .
SWANA: Good morning , Gaston .
GASTON: Count d'Algout is still asleep .
SWANA: That 's all right .
SWANA: Leon ! What in heaven 's name !
LEON: Huh ?
SWANA: Is anything wrong ? Are you ill ?
LEON: No .
SWANA: Do n't tell me the bed has lost its est friend .
LEON: I just could n't sleep . I got up and went back and then got up again . These last few days whew !
SWANA: Darling , you 're taking my business affairs far too seriously . Much as I 'd love to rob the Bolsheviks of their filthy money , I wo n't do it at the expense of your health . Particularly as we know we wo n't get much . You look so pale pale but interesting . There is a knock at the door .
GASTON: Your breakfast , monsieur .
LEON: I do n't feel like any breakfast .
SWANA: Nonsense . How can you fight the Reds and make yourself agreeable to the Whites if you do n't keep up you strength .
GASTON: Shall I draw your bath , sir ?
LEON: Make it ice cold .
SWANA: Not in your condition . Make it tepid , Gaston tepid and tender . And lay out his gray suit . Afterwards I 'll drive you through the Bois . Slowly in Waltz time .
GASTON: A blue shirt , perhaps ?
SWANA: Blue ? Let 's offset his mood . Find a striped one , and brighten it with a great blaze of tie .
GASTON: Very well , Your Highness .
SWANA: Now here we have two very handsome soft-boiled eggs . Do you suppose hens mind what happens to their eggs ? Probably not . They have such unfeeling eyes . We 'll put in a great nugget of utter , plenty of pepper and salt Darling , I have n't seen you for three livelong days seventy-two hours !
LEON: Oh , please , Swana ! I do n't know whether I 'm standing on my head o my heels . Here you are blaming me for neglecting you when I 'm trying to concentrate on another woman and ca n't get near her .
SWANA: You have n't seen her yet ?
LEON: No , and believe me I 've tried everything ! I must have telephoned her a hundred times . I 've sent he telegrams , I 've sent her flowers I asked her to dinner I offered her seats for the Opera
SWANA: That proletarian ! In the old days we 'd have had her flogged .
LEON: That would n't have done any good . Not with her . She 's the most incredible creature I 've ever seen .
SWANA: You just told me you had n't seen her .
LEON: Well er I caught a glimpse of her when she walked through the lobby .
SWANA: Imagine the carpets of a self- especting Parisian hotel dirtied by the boots of a muzhik ! What does she look like ?
LEON: You ca n't imagine .
SWANA: That bad ? Old or young ?
LEON: Timeless . When she comes into a room you 'd think that the Bolsheviks had taken over Paris . She wears her cheap miserable blouse as though it were the latest model by Schiaparelli . What a woman ! What a woman ! There is a Russian snowstorm in each of he eyes .
SWANA: You saw all that in one glimpse ?
LEON: Darling , if we 're going to get anywhere someone has to keep his eyes open !
SWANA: Now , darling , soak in your beautiful pine bath and let Gaston shave you .
KOPALSKI: We want to talk to Count d'Algout . My name is Kopalski .
SWANA: Oh you are the three gentlemen from Moscow ?
KOPALSKI: Yes .
SWANA: You may wait . She closes the door .
BULJANOFF: That 's her .
KOPALSKI: Imagine ! The niece of the Czar opening the door for us .
BULJANOFF: Once in Petersburg I was driving down the Nevsky Prospect in my cart and Her Highness in her troika swept down from the opposite direction , and when I could n't make way quick enough she spat in my face .
IRANOFF: Now look here , Buljanoff . You neve were in Petersburg , you never owned a cart , and she never spat in you face . Who are you trying to impress ?
LEON: Hello , boys .
KOPALSKI: Leon , Leonitchka , she is not going to negotiate ! She is going to fight that injunction . She 's going to make a precedent of it !
IRANOFF: She says she wo n't be intimidated by parasites . She called the Duchess a lood-sucking aristocrat and a lackmailer .
LEON: What did she say about me ?
IRANOFF: I think she covered you with the parasites . Leon is disappointed .
BULJANOFF: And Leonitchka ! What she said about us !
IRANOFF: And they might believe her in Moscow .
BULJANOFF: What do you mean they might they will !
KOPALSKI: We do n't blame you , Leon , but when we came from Russia we believed in simplicity
IRANOFF: We avoided luxury and extravagance and today well , if you were to offer us a glass of champagne , we would n't say no .
LEON: Well , boys , I 'd like to help you but what can I do ? Yesterday I waited six hours in the lobby !
KOPALSKI: She does n't leave her room ! She has een locked in for the last two days with lawyers and law books !
LEON: All right , then make an appointment with her so I can see her !
KOPALSKI: We ca n't but you are so ingenious , Leon
IRANOFF: You found your way to us and we were n't easy to reach , were we ?
LEON: No , no .
BULJANOFF: Did n't we put up a strong resistance ?
LEON: Oh , yes , yes .
KOPALSKI: You must help us , Leon if you do n't win her over we 're on our way to Siberia !
BULJANOFF: Or it might be the firing squad !
KOPALSKI: Or we ca n't go back to Russia ! An idea dawns on Iranoff .
IRANOFF: What 's wrong with that ?
BULJANOFF: Yes ! We could stay with Leon !
IRANOFF: Leon , how would you like to have three lifelong friends ?
LEON: Boys , boys do n't forget Russia is your mother country . Three sons walking out all at once that 's too much for any mother .
BULJANOFF: Well , if your mother turns against you , you have to look for someone to adopt you . Swana 's voice comes from the next room .
SWANA: Leon ! Just a minute Leon goes back to the other room .
FIRST LAWYER: I seem to remember some additional injunctive provision dealing with the property of foreigners residing in France .
NINOTCHKA: You are referring to paragraph 59b , section 25f of the Civil Code .
RAKONIN: Room service Just a moment please .
LEON: Room service speaking .
NINOTCHKA: Send me a plate of raw carrots and eets , beets predominating on a ratio of sixty-forty What ? There is a strike in the kitchen ? Good ! Will you assure the strikers of my hearty sympathy in their cause . I hope they will not weaken in their demands and tell them to put no dressing whatsoever on my vegetables What ? You wo n't serve me either ? Now look here , Comrade , I think it is a fine idea to let the capitalists go without luncheon but when you keep food away from me you 're weakening the people .
LEON: So ! You want to make a strike breake out of me ! I am surprised at you , Comrade ! Is it too much for the workers of the world to ask you to walk around the corner for lunch ? All I can say to you is take you hammer and sickle and get out of that Royal Suite !
NINOTCHKA: Tsk , tsk , tsk . She walks toward the street , as we
TAXI DRIVER: Where to , madame ?
NINOTCHKA: Can you recommend a restaurant ?
TAXI DRIVER: Well , there 's Pruniers if you care for seafood . If you want to lunch in the Bois , there 's
NINOTCHKA: Where do you eat ?
TAXI DRIVER: At Père Mathieu 's .
NINOTCHKA: Where is that ?
TAXI DRIVER: It 's just a place for workmen .
NINOTCHKA: Where is it ?
TAXI DRIVER: Eight blocks down in the Rue de Poivrel . He opens the door of his cab .
NINOTCHKA: Thank you .
PÈRE MATHIEU: This way , madame . Are you alone ? By the window perhaps ? Or a nice little corner table ?
NINOTCHKA: This will do .
PÈRE MATHIEU: I think this is the first time you have been to my little place . You face is new to me . Now , what shall it be ?
NINOTCHKA: Raw carrots and beets .
PÈRE MATHIEU: Oh , madame ! This is a restaurant , not a meadow .
LEON: Why , hello ! It certainly is a small world !
PÈRE MATHIEU: Well , madame ? Shall we start with soup ? Fish soup today . I got up at five to fish them from the Seine .
LEON: Crayfish soup for me !
PÈRE MATHIEU: Very well , monsieur . Then , may I suggest an omelet with mushrooms ?
NINOTCHKA: Bring me something simple . I neve think about food .
PÈRE MATHIEU: But , madame ! If you do n't think about food what do you think about ?
NINOTCHKA: The future of the common people .
PÈRE MATHIEU: That also is a question of food , madame . I 'll bring you a nice little lunch à la Père Mathieu .
LEON: Pardon me for addressing you but you insulted him , you know that . You hurt his feelings . It was just like telling a musician you do n't like music . That good old man believes in food as you believe in Karl Marx . You ca n't go around hurting people , Comrade Yakushova , but maybe you can make it up to him . Do you know how ? By eating everything with relish , by drinking everything with gusto , by having a good time for the first time in your natural life !
NINOTCHKA: I do n't like your following me .
LEON: I did n't follow you .
NINOTCHKA: Then how did you get here ?
LEON: I always eat here .
NINOTCHKA: This is a place for workmen .
LEON: But my dear child , I am most at home among working men . I hate the places where you circulate the Hotel Clarence This is my natural element . After all , what are any of us ? Workingmen ! At least , those of us who are worth our salt . Hyah ? He waves off scene to a truckman .
LEON: Hyah !
PÈRE MATHIEU: I 'm always glad to meet a new customer , and I hope this first visit will not be your last . He exits out of shot .
LEON: Just an old man . His memory is getting weak .
NINOTCHKA: What are you after ?
LEON: Must one always be after something ?
NINOTCHKA: Your tactics are useless . My name is neither Buljanoff , Iranoff , no Kopalski .
LEON: Oh , Ninotchka , who wants to talk usiness . If you win the suit , fine . If we win the suit , better . You do me an injustice . When we went to my apartment did I have the slightest idea that you had any connection with this deal ?
NINOTCHKA: But you have now , and I know now that you are a man who employs usiness methods which in Russia would be punished by death .
LEON: Death ! Death ! Always so glum ! What about life , Ninotchka ! Do Russians never think of life ? Of the moment in which we are living ? The only moment we really have ? Do n't take it all so seriously , Ninotchka . Nothing is worth it . Please relax I eg you , Sergeant smile !
NINOTCHKA: What ?
LEON: Will you smile ?
NINOTCHKA: Why ?
LEON: Just smile .
NINOTCHKA: At what ?
LEON: At anything . At the whole ludicrous spectacle of life . At people being pompous and taking themselves seriously and exaggerating their own importance . If you ca n't find anything else to laugh at you can laugh at you and me .
NINOTCHKA: Why ?
LEON: Because we are an odd couple .
NINOTCHKA: Then you should go back to your table .
LEON: No , I ca n't leave you . I wo n't . Not yet . Not until I 've made you laugh at least once .
NINOTCHKA: Ha ! Ha ! Now go back .
LEON: That 's not a laugh ! I mean a laugh from the heart . Now let 's see . I 'm going to tell you a funny story . Just a moment I 've got it ! Well , it seems there were a couple of Frenchmen who went to America
NINOTCHKA: On which boat ?
LEON: Well , er let 's drop it . I do n't think you would care for that one .
NINOTCHKA: Probably not .
LEON: Do you like Scotch stories ?
NINOTCHKA: I have never heard one .
LEON: Two Scotchmen met on the street and I do n't know the name of the street and it really does n't matter . Well , anyway , one 's name was McIntosh and the other 's was McGillicuddy . McIntosh says to McGillicuddy , `` Hello , Mr. McGillicuddy , '' and McGillicuddy says to McIntosh , `` Hello , Mr. McIntosh , '' and then McIntosh says to McGillicuddy , `` How is Mrs . McGillicuddy ? '' and then McGillicuddy says to McIntosh , `` How is Mrs . McIntosh ? ''
NINOTCHKA: I wish they had never met .
LEON: So do I . Now , here 's a great one Ha ! Ha ! Ha ! Well , maybe it 's not so good . Let 's forget it ! How 's this ? Two men are looking at the moon . One says to the other , `` Is it true that a lot of people live on the moon ? '' `` Yes , it is , '' says the other , `` five hundred million . '' `` Whew ! '' replies the first , `` they must get pretty crowded when it 's half moon ! '' Ha ! Ha ! Ha ! There is no response from Ninotchka .
NINOTCHKA: No .
LEON: It seemed funny to me when I first heard it . Maybe the trouble is n't with the joke . Maybe it 's with you !
NINOTCHKA: I do n't think so .
LEON: Maybe you have n't any sense of humor . Well , I 'll give you one more chance ! Now listen !
NINOTCHKA: No .
LEON: So you do n't think that 's funny ? It is funny ! Everyone else thinks so ! Maybe you did n't get it . He sits down again .
NINOTCHKA: Yes .
LEON: He sits down at the table and says to the waiter Did you get that too ?
NINOTCHKA: Yes .
LEON: Well , so far it is n't funny , but wait . He says to the waiter , `` Waiter ! Bring me a cup of coffee . '' So the waiter comes back five minutes late and says , `` I 'm sorry , sir , we have no coffee . '' Wait a minute wait a minute I 'm all mixed up A man comes in a restaurant , he sits down , he calls the waiter and he says , `` Waiter ! Get me a cup of coffee without cream , '' and five minutes later the waiter comes back and says , `` I 'm sorry , sir , we have no cream , can it be a glass of milk ! ''
LAWYER: In addition to the arguments above enumerated for lifting this injunction , we wish to cite the decision of the High Court of Paris , endered in the case of Princess Marishka against the Government of Montenegro on the fifth day of August , 1897 . Comparing the facts in that case with our present set of facts we feel that the Treaty between the Republic of France and the U.S.S.R. should prevail over all
NINOTCHKA: I 'm sorry , gentlemen . The other day I heard such a funny story It still makes me laugh . It is very funny . I am sorry . Oh yes about this injunction
LAWYER: The hearing is set for the twentieth of this month .
NINOTCHKA: That 's two weeks from Thursday
LAWYER: We did our utmost to have it set ahead .
NINOTCHKA: I know , gentlemen , but it is in the hands of the Court . We 're helpless , are n't we ?
LAWYER: Yes . It is unfortunate .
NINOTCHKA: Well , there 's nothing we can do about it . Why get excited ?
LAWYER: We 'll leave these papers here fo your further consideration . Au revoir , madame .
NINOTCHKA: Au revoir . The Lawyers leave .
IRANOFF: Too bad we have to waste all that time .
KOPALSKI: I acted on your suggestion and got in touch with the Power and Light authorities . Whenever you want to visit their plants they are open to you .
NINOTCHKA: Oh yes , Power and Light . Thank you .
BULJANOFF: There 's something else which I know will appeal to you . A visit to the Paris sewers . They tell me it is extremely instructive .
NINOTCHKA: Huh ? Why do n't you get a haircut , Buljanoff ? You all look so wintry , Comrades . And why do we always keep the windows closed ? Is n't it amazing , at home there 's still snow and ice and here Look at the birds . I always felt a little hurt that our swallows deserted us in the winter for capitalistic countries . Now I know why . We have the high ideal but they have the climate well , Comrades , I do n't think I need you any more .
KOPALSKI: If there is anything we can do fo you
NINOTCHKA: No , not a thing . Would you like to go out ?
LEON: What time have you , Gaston ?
GASTON: Eight forty-two , sir .
LEON: I guess it is eight forty-two .
GASTON: You seem to be a bit nervous , sir .
LEON: I am , Gaston .
GASTON: If you will forgive me , ever since you met that Bolshevik lady I 've noticed a distinct change in you , sir .
LEON: Have you ?
GASTON: Decidedly . Yesterday I was greatly amazed when I came from the market and found that you had made you ed , sir .
LEON: And Gaston , I was happier all day long . I felt I 'd contributed something .
GASTON: Well , sir , if you should do it again , which I hope you wo n't , please emember the order . Counterpane , lanket , blanket , sheet , sheet .
LEON: Ah , there 's something poetic about the simple processes of labor . Counterpane , blanket , blanket , sheet , sheet it should be set to music !
GASTON: May I add , sir , that it was with great amazement that I found a copy of Karl Marx 's Capital on your night table . That is a socialistic volume which I refuse to so much as dust , sir . I view with alarm , sir , the influence over you of this Bolshevik lady .
LEON: I ca n't follow you , Gaston , is n't it about time that you realized the unfairness of your position ? You eing my servant ? Would n't you like to stand on an equal footing with me ?
GASTON: No , sir .
LEON: Is n't there any revolt in you ? Sometimes when I order you around do n't you feel like kicking me in the pants ?
GASTON: No , sir .
LEON: Oh , you 're a reactionary ! Do n't you look forward to the day when you can come in here and stand square on your two feet and say , `` Hey , you , d'Algout ! from now on it 's going to e share and share alike '' ?
GASTON: Emphatically not , sir . The prospect terrifies me . Now , do n't misunderstand me , sir , I do n't resent your not paying me for the past two months , ut the thought that I should split my bank account with you that you should take half of my life 's savings that is really too much for me .
LEON: Go to bed , little father , go to bed .
NINOTCHKA: I do n't look too foolish ?
LEON: Foolish ? If this dress were to walk down the boulevard all by itself I would follow it from one end of Paris to the other , and when I caught up with it I would say , `` Just a moment , you charming little dress , I want you to meet Ninotchka you two were meant for each other . '' Ninotchka feels more comfortable . Leon leads her into the living room .
NINOTCHKA: I 've never been here before . I wonde whom you 're thinking of . Oh , I know , a girl with a map , figuring out each step , worrying about north and south . Today now this might shock you I went up to a taxi and said `` Eight Rue du Bois '' and here I am .
LEON: You see ? Life can be so simple .
NINOTCHKA: For twelve francs , seventy-five .
LEON: Twelve seventy-five from the Clarence ? The son-of-a-gun made a detour ! But he got you here .
NINOTCHKA: It 's nine o'clock .
LEON: That 's when one half of Paris says to the other half , `` What are you plans for this evening , madame ? ''
NINOTCHKA: Well , first I should like to take off my hat and jacket . Then could we have some music ?
LEON: A wonderful idea ! Radio or records ?
NINOTCHKA: Not radio . Let 's have music that 's just for ourselves . Leon turns on the victrola .
LEON: I 'll play it softly because I have things to tell you about which I ca n't shout .
NINOTCHKA: Leon , you know the jokes you told me a few days ago ? I wake up in the middle of the night and laugh at them . Now , Leon that 's wrong . I know they 're not funny , they 're silly . They 're stupid . And still I laugh and when I look at Buljanoff and Iranoff and Kopalski I know they are scoundrels and I should hate them then I realize who made them like that , and instead of sending my eport to Moscow I tear it up and go down and buy a ridiculous hat and if this keeps on am I too talkative ?
LEON: No go on .
NINOTCHKA: Leon , I want to tell you something which I thought I never would say , which I thought nobody ever should say , because I thought it did n't exist and , Leon I ca n't say it
LEON: What a gesture for a sergeant .
NINOTCHKA: Leon , I would like to ask you something .
LEON: Anything , Ninotchka .
NINOTCHKA: If you do n't want to answer , you need n't . But if you do , you must tell me the truth .
LEON: I promise I swear .
NINOTCHKA: Did you make any change in this room ?
LEON: I do n't think so .
NINOTCHKA: When I was here before I noticed a photograph of a woman on the desk in a wide silver frame . I thought what a waste of silver . That 's all that interested me then . Now I would like to know what happened to the woman ?
LEON: Ninotchka , I love you .
NINOTCHKA: I suppose she is very entertaining It must be lots of fun to be with her , so witty , so glamorous
LEON: Ninotchka , you 're jealous . Ninotchka nods sadly .
NINOTCHKA: Leon , do n't ever ask me for a picture of myself I could n't bear the thought of being shut up in a drawer I could n't breathe , I could n't stand it .
LEON: My darling . As he takes her in his arms , we
HEADWAITER: Good evening , Your Highness .
SWANA: Good evening , Louis . You seem to be very crowded tonight . Can you manage a table near the floor ?
HEADWAITER: Certainly , Your Highness , this way please Count d'Algout made the eservation this afternoon .
SWANA: Count d'Algout
HEADWAITER: It is only a small table but it will e no trouble to put in some extra chairs . Swana has grasped the situation by now .
SWANA: No , that 's another party .
LADY: Why do n't we go some other place ? It 's so crowded here .
SWANA: No , no ! This is glory ! At last I 'm going to have a look at that female Bolshevik . Can you give us anothe table ?
HEADWAITER: Only one in the rear , I 'm afraid .
SWANA: That 's perfect !
ANOTHER GUEST: I would n't have missed this for the world .
SWANA: Now , we must be very discreet . If she sucks her soup and drinks out of her finger bowl , I do n't want anyone to laugh . We must not embarrass little Leon . He is going through enough for my sake . We must n't add insult to injury
HEADWAITER: Is this satisfactory ?
SWANA: Thank you , Louis .
HEADWAITER: Is it to be dinner , monsieur ?
GENERAL SAVITZKY: Possibly later . We 'll just start with champagne .
SWANA: I 'm only afraid that the doorman may spoil our fun . If only he lets he in !
GENERAL SAVITZKY: Your Highness
SWANA: Yes , General Savitzky ?
GENERAL SAVITZKY: I want you to know all the White Russian exiles in Paris are keeping their fingers crossed about the jewels . They are very interested in the case . Swana suspects he countrymen .
SWANA: Are they indeed ? Thank you .
GENERAL SAVITZKY: They hope the settlement will bring you a fortune .
SWANA: General , please if you hear any umors that I am a charitable person , will you please kill them at thei source ?
GUEST: Look ! There 's Leon !
MARIANNE: Is n't she something ?
SWANA: Shall we dance , General Savitzky ?
GUEST: Are you crazy ?
ANOTHER GUEST: How could you make such a remark ?
THIRD GUEST: Swana is n't stupid .
MARIANNE: What did I say ? I just said `` is n't she something ? '' I did n't say something what .
LEON: Is it dry ?
WAITER: Yes , monsieur .
LEON: Is that right or do you prefer it sweet ?
NINOTCHKA: I would n't know . The closest I eve came to champagne was in a newsreel . The wife of some president was throwing it at a battleship .
LEON: It 's always good luck to launch something with champagne ; a attleship or an evening .
NINOTCHKA: It 's funny to look back . I was brought up on goat 's milk , I had a ration of vodka in the army , and now champagne .
LEON: From goats to grapes . That 's drinking in the right direction .
NINOTCHKA: Ugh um oh It 's good .
LEON: There have been cases but the headache the next morning is worth while if you drink it with the ight toast . To us , Ninotchka !
SWANA: Hello , Leon ! What a surprise ! You of all people ! How are you , my dear ?
LEON: Hello , Swana . How do you do , General Savitzky ?
GENERAL SAVITZKY: How do you do ?
SWANA: You 're looking magnificent , Leon is n't he , General Savitzky ?
GENERAL SAVITZKY: Yes .
LEON: Thank you .
SWANA: Is this your new dress suit ?
LEON: Yes , Swana .
SWANA: Did n't I tell you Benson and Benson were the tailors for you ?
LEON: Yes , Swana , you did .
SWANA: It 's a dream of beauty . He neve takes my word for anything , but I was right , was n't I ?
LEON: Yes , Swana .
SWANA: Am I interrupting ?
LEON: Not at all . Your Highness , may I present Madame Yakushova ?
SWANA: How do you do ?
NINOTCHKA: How do you do ?
LEON: And General Savitzky .
GENERAL SAVITZKY: How do you do ?
NINOTCHKA: How do you do ?
SWANA: I 've some wonderful news for you , Leon . It 's about Punchy do you mind if I sit down ?
LEON: No please Swana sits down .
SWANA: General , would you mind making my excuses at our table ? I 'll be back in a few moments .
GENERAL SAVITZKY: Certainly . He bows and leaves .
SWANA: Well , Leon , we can be proud of ou Punchy . He had a triumph at the dog show .
LEON: Months , Swana .
SWANA: Poor Madame Yakushova here we are talking in mysteries . I 'm sure you wonder what it 's all about .
NINOTCHKA: Not at all . I understand perfectly , Count d'Algout gave you a dog . You made it very clear , madame .
SWANA: Dear me I must be losing my finesse . If I 'm not careful I 'll be understood by everybody .
LEON: There 's a charming crowd here tonight , is n't there ?
SWANA: I 'm going , Leon ut before I leave I must compliment you on your gown , Madame Yakushova . Is that what they 're wearing in Moscow this year ?
NINOTCHKA: No , last year , madame . Swana sits again , as does Leon .
SWANA: Is n't it amazing ! One gets a wrong impression of the new Russia . It must be charming . I 'm glad conditions are so improved . I assume this is what the factory workers wear at their dances ?
NINOTCHKA: Exactly . You see , it would have been embarrassing for people of my sort to wear low-cut gowns in the old Russia . The lashes of the Cossacks across our backs were not very ecoming , and you know how vain women are .
SWANA: You 're absolutely right about the Cossacks . We made an unpardonable mistake when we let them use thei knouts . They had such reliable guns .
LEON: Will you do me a favor ? Stop talking about the good old days .
SWANA: A very wise suggestion , Leon . I 'm afraid madame and I will never agree . The only thing we have in common is our lawsuit and that will be decided next week . I understand everything will be over by Thursday . Am I right ?
NINOTCHKA: You 're right , madame , it will all be over by Thursday .
SWANA: It is unfortunate that you have so few more days in Paris . Be sure and redouble your efforts so that madame can take some pleasant memories when she returns to Moscow . Good night . Good night , Leon .
LEON: Good night , Swana .
NINOTCHKA: Now I think I need a glass of champagne .
LEON: A funny story ?
NINOTCHKA: You never finished the one about the two Scotchmen with the names .
LEON: Well , there were two Scotchmen . One was named McIntosh and one was named McGillicuddy . They met on the street . He stops .
NINOTCHKA: Go on .
LEON: No , darling . I 'll tell you anothe story , a much better one . The only thing that will be over on Thursday is the lawsuit . There will e no Thursday for us . Not next week or any week . We wo n't let it happen . I 'll tear it out of the calendar . Is that a good story ?
NINOTCHKA: Wonderful if one could believe it .
LEON: You must , darling .
NINOTCHKA: To the loveliest story I ever heard . They drink . The orchestra starts a number .
LEON: You just made that trip from goats to grapes a little too fast .
NINOTCHKA: Oh , everything is so wonderful ! It 's getting farther and farther away !
LEON: What , darling ?
NINOTCHKA: Thursday .
LEON: Yes . Do n't worry . Everything will be all right .
NINOTCHKA: Comrades ! Comrades !
LEON: Darling , darling please !
NINOTCHKA: I must talk to my brothers !
LEON: Shhh ! Shhh !
NINOTCHKA: Do n't shush me . I am People ! I want to make a speech . I want to overthrow the Duchess ! Leon starts to lead her off the dance floor .
LEON: But , darling , you ca n't do that .
NINOTCHKA: Comrades ! Good people of France !
LEON: Now , Ninotchka please !
NINOTCHKA: They are all Duchesses here thousands of Duchesses and I am going to tell them .
LEON: Quite right yes , yes , yes , but first you 're going in that door and you 're going to take a little spirits of ammonia and lie down .
NINOTCHKA: No speech ?
LEON: No speech .
NINOTCHKA: I love you , my little Leonitchka !
LEON: And I adore you , Ninotchua .
MANAGER: I 'm very sorry , Count d'Algout , it is most embarrassing , but the lady you brought with you tonight is spreading communistic propaganda in the powder room .
LEON: Give me another double brandy .
MANAGER: That kind of propaganda is bad anywhere , but inciting the attendants of a powder room to go on strike . Well , if she succeeds the consequences will be disastrous .
LEON: What can I do about it ?
MANAGER: She has been asked to leave the powde oom but without success . We would appreciate if you would see to it yourself .
LEON: You want me to go in there ?
MANAGER: I 'm sorry , sir , but I must insist .
LEON: Make it a triple brandy . As we
NINOTCHKA: Do n't tell them where we 're going , sweetheart .
LEON: No . Nobody will find us .
NINOTCHKA: Are we going to build our little house ?
LEON: Yes a little white house .
NINOTCHKA: Not white , darling .
LEON: All right , we 'll make it red .
NINOTCHKA: No , do n't let 's have it any color no color just a house house let 's form our own party .
LEON: Right Lovers of the world unite !
NINOTCHKA: And we wo n't stretch up our arms
LEON: No ! No !
NINOTCHKA: and we wo n't clench our fist
LEON: No ! No !
NINOTCHKA: Our salute will be a kiss .
LEON: Yes a kiss salute ! She sinks into his arms and they kiss .
NINOTCHKA: I am so happy . No one can be so happy without being punished . I will be punished and I should be punished . I want to confess , darling .
LEON: I know it 's the Russian soul .
NINOTCHKA: Everyone wants to confess and if they do n't confess they make them confess . I am a traitor . When I kissed you I betrayed the Russian ideal . Leon , I should be stood up against the wall . Leon gets up .
LEON: Would that make you any happier ?
NINOTCHKA: Much happier .
LEON: All right .
NINOTCHKA: I have paid the penalty . Now let 's have some music .
LEON: Let 's turn on the radio .
NINOTCHKA: Radio ! What is radio ?
LEON: It 's a little box that you buy on the installment plan and before you tune it in they tell you they have a new model .
NINOTCHKA: Oh yes , yes . It has a little kno that turns a little knob it must be somewhere around here yes here I see
LEON: What shall we get ? The news !
NINOTCHKA: No , no news . We do n't want to know what 's happening in the world . We want to be left alone , do n't we ?
LEON: Yes , sweetheart all by ourselves .
NINOTCHKA: Well , then we turn twice to the right and stop at seven Leon follows her instructions .
LEON: Well , it has to warm up you have to give it a chance just like people like you and me first you wanted to fight me and now we elong to the same party salute !
NINOTCHKA: Now twice to the left and stop at seventeen . Leon again follows her instructions . INTERIOR SAFE , shooting toward the door .
LEON: No , no music .
NINOTCHKA: There it is Thursday you ca n't ip it out of the week .
LEON: But I can throw it out of the window .
NINOTCHKA: It would n't be fair to the man in the street . There they are they are terrible things , those jewels .
LEON: but big .
NINOTCHKA: they are the tears of Old Russia see that stone ?
LEON: Who cried that one ?
NINOTCHKA: Czar Peter gave it to his wife , Catherine the Great . For it he sold ten thousand serfs in the market .
LEON: Now , darling , do n't get impatient , wait until we are married . You know that worthless butler of mine that reactionary ? Some day when I come home to you I may say , `` Darling , I drove Gaston to the market and look what I got from him ! ''
NINOTCHKA: First ten thousand serfs now just Gaston . It is very encouraging .
LEON: Come , sweetheart . Let me put it on you . You will teach these jewels . For the first time they will learn how they can look .
NINOTCHKA: They belong to the people .
LEON: I give them back to the people I make you Ninotchka the Great Duchess of the People ! Grand Duchess of the People !
NINOTCHKA: Is this the wish of the masses ?
LEON: It is their wish .
NINOTCHKA: Thank you , Leon thank you , masses . Can I make a speech now ?
LEON: Please . Ninotchka turns to an imaginary assemblage .
NINOTCHKA: Comrades ! People of the world ! The evolution is on the march I know wars will wash over us ombs will fall all civilization will crumble but not yet , please wait , wait what 's the hurry ? Let us be happy give us ou moment . We are happy , are n't we , Leon ?
LEON: Yes , sweetheart .
NINOTCHKA: So happy and so tired .
SWANA: Good morning .
NINOTCHKA: What ?
SWANA: It is tomorrow morning tomorrow noon , to be exact . I hope you will forgive me . I know it 's extremely cruel to waken anyone at such an hour . Do n't you recognize me ? I am the Duchess Swana .
NINOTCHKA: I think we can cut your visit short . Leon is not here .
SWANA: Of course not , my dear ! I did n't come here with any such suspicion . How ridiculous ! Nor did I come here to pick up his hat .
NINOTCHKA: If you were encouraged to come here y our meeting last night I am afraid you misunderstood my attitude .
SWANA: Do n't worry , you were quite rude enough . Do you mind if I let in a little fresh air and sunshine ? I 'm sure it will make you feel better and I want you to be at your very best . In full possession of your faculties , at least .
NINOTCHKA: Please come to the point . What is it you want ?
SWANA: I just dropped in to have a little heart-to-heart talk with you .
NINOTCHKA: We have nothing to discuss .
SWANA: Now there you are completely wrong . If we sit down for a little chat , I 'm sure we wo n't run out of conversation and what 's more it wo n't e dull .
NINOTCHKA: Madame , what is it you people always say , regardless of what you mean `` I am delighted to have you here '' ? I have not reached that stage of civilization .
SWANA: That 's all right I grow on people .
NINOTCHKA: I must ask you to leave .
SWANA: Leave ? That 's exactly what I came here to ask you to do . Leave ! I do n't mean this hotel and I do n't mean Paris I mean France . There 's a plane for Moscow at five-forty .
NINOTCHKA: Madame , if you
SWANA: Do n't worry . I have already made eservations . It 's perfect flying weather . They assure me there 's a fine tail wind which will sweep you ack to Moscow in no time .
NINOTCHKA: If this is meant to be a joke it is not funny . Or do you still think you 're issuing orders from your palace in Petrograd ?
SWANA: My palace in Petrograd yes , you took that away from me . You took away my czar , my country , my people , everything I had ut nothing more I warn you .
NINOTCHKA: People can not be taken away , madame , neither a hundred and sixty million nor one . Not if you have their love . You had n't . That 's why you 're not in Russia any longer , and that 's why you came here this morning .
SWANA: Very interesting , my dear , but could n't you write all that from Moscow ? A dissertation on love on Soviet stationery would be an amusing paradox .
NINOTCHKA: It is not enough to be witty , madame . People grow tired of being entertained . You made that mistake efore . Problems were never solved y bowing from a balcony .
SWANA: My dear , you do n't know how impressive I could be . Did you ever see me in my regalia with my diadem and all my jewels ?
NINOTCHKA: I must insist that you leave .
SWANA: Not before you agree to use those eservations to Moscow .
NINOTCHKA: In that case I can only say good-by . Abruptly she walks toward the bedroom .
SWANA: I would n't waken Leon . After last night I would say not before three o'clock at the earliest .
NINOTCHKA: I told you to go , madame .
SWANA: Believe me , Leon ca n't help you . He does n't know anything about the jewels I give you my word I swear it .
NINOTCHKA: Where are they ?
SWANA: You were very careless with ou precious jewels , my dear . They 're too expensive a toy for two children to play with .
NINOTCHKA: Where are they ?
SWANA: Do n't worry . Fortunately last night a very trustworthy friend kept his eyes open . Perhaps he overstepped his function as a waiter but he fulfilled his duty as a Russian . I just put this on for sentiment . The rest are absolutely safe . I assure you . But if you feel like notifying the police
NINOTCHKA: You leave me no choice .
SWANA: Wo n't it be rather embarrassing fo a Soviet Envoy to disclose the circumstances under which she lost them ?
NINOTCHKA: I will have to face the consequences , ut so will you . Do n't forget they will ask how you got them .
SWANA: That 's very simple to answer . They were given to me by my mother . They were given to her by her mother , in fact they 're mine , you can not steal what belongs to you !
NINOTCHKA: They always belonged to the Russian people . They were paid for with thei sweat , their blood , their lives and you will give them back !
SWANA: I told you we had plenty to talk about . Shall we sit down ? They both sit .
NINOTCHKA: In other words moral ideas have no weight with you all right , then let 's deal with legal facts . You know that France has recognized the Soviet .
SWANA: Unfortunately .
NINOTCHKA: Under Soviet law the jewels belong to the State . France is going to uphold that ownership .
SWANA: My lawyer agrees with you . He says France will uphold it in every court , ut I will drag you through every court , do n't forget that . And when I say it will take two years I am , as always , conservative .
NINOTCHKA: Wo n't those two years in court be expensive for you ? I know that money was no object as long as you could squeeze it from the pockets of the people , but now
SWANA: I may run out of money , but you have already run out of bread . Two years is a long time for your comrades to wait .
NINOTCHKA: I see . You have calculated in terms of hunger .
SWANA: No , I just wanted to be absolutely impartial . Both of us are faced with two rather uncomfortable years . We can condense these two years to two minutes if you want to accept my proposition . Ninotchka now realizes what she is after .
NINOTCHKA: Go on .
SWANA: I am willing to hand over the jewels and sign the necessary papers if you take that five-forty plane to Moscow .
NINOTCHKA: That 's not the way to win him back not Leon .
SWANA: I think I know Leon quite as well as you possibly a little better . Leave that worry to me . Five-forty leaves you time enough to close the deal with Monsieur Mercier , but naturally you 'll be too busy for any farewells . I 'll see to it that everything is done in the most expeditious manner and I will also see you to the airport . That 's my proposition , Comrade Yakushova .
NINOTCHKA: Yes Oh hello
SWANA: Good afternoon , Jacqueline .
MAID: Good afternoon , Your Highness . Madame , I
SWANA: You did n't find my glove . All right , you 're forgiven .
MAID: Thank you , Your Highness . Count d'Algout is waiting . He 's been here some time .
SWANA: Leon , darling , how nice ! Have you ordered tea or a cocktail ?
LEON: No thanks , Swana .
SWANA: Did I act stupidly last night ? Should I apologize ?
LEON: I 'm the one who should apologize . I should have talked to you before .
SWANA: Is this , by any chance , going to be a confession ?
LEON: Yes .
SWANA: Oh , no , my little Volga boatman . Have you forgotten our First Commandment Never Complain Neve Explain . It has worked so often and so perfectly , do n't let 's break the ule . And please do n't look so guilty , otherwise I 'll
LEON: This time , Swana just this once I must ask you to listen .
SWANA: All right , I 'll listen .
LEON: I know you hate the obvious but do you mind if , at this moment , I 'm not in the least subtle ?
SWANA: Brutal frankness , if you insist .
LEON: There are a hundred ways to approach it , but I feel it can best be said in one simple phrase . I 'm in love , Swana .
SWANA: And I thought it was something serious ! How could you frighten me so ?
LEON: It must be serious , Swana . Not long ago I 'd have considered such a statement rather juvenile and rathe middle class . Now I can say it without stammering , without a blush . I 'm in love , Swana .
SWANA: Say it over and over again , Leon . Words are a wonderful safety valve , and that 's what you need because you know it 's impossible , do n't you ?
LEON: I have to be simple again , Swana , and you may find it shockingly banal . I 've thought it over and I 'm willing to take all the consequences , even if it means a complete readjustment of my way of living .
SWANA: Leon ! This has the ugly sound of egeneration .
LEON: I 'm afraid that 's what it is .
SWANA: The same old trouble , Leon . You 're always late . Whether you 're taking me to the Opera or calling for me at a beauty shop , you 're never on time . And now , when it 's a question of your reform late again . By about five minutes .
LEON: What is this , Swana ?
SWANA: Knowing the efficiency of the French Air Service I think I can guarantee that Madame Yakushova has already taken off for Moscow .
LEON: Has done what ?
SWANA: She 's gone , Leon .
LEON: Do you expect me to believe that ?
SWANA: Here 's the telephone . If you call the hotel you will find that you have no seven o'clock appointment .
BULJANOFF: Imagine , for once in our lives we were in Paris and we never went to the Eiffel Tower .
KOPALSKI: That 's right .
IRANOFF: They tell me it has a wonderful estaurant on the second floor .
KOPALSKI: While you eat , you look at the view .
NINOTCHKA: Yes , it is an amazing piece of engineering . Still the most remarkable iron structure in the world . Leading to the top there is a staircase of over a thousand steps but an elevator is included in the price of admission .
OFFICIAL: Well , everything is in order . I hope you will enjoy your trip to Russia , madame .
ENGLISH LADY: Thank you . Oh , by the way , I 've heard so many rumors about laundry conditions in Russia . Is it advisable to take one 's own towels ?
OFFICIAL: Certainly not , madame . That 's only capitalistic propaganda . We change the towel every week .
ENGLISH LADY: Oh thank you . She leaves . Leon moves up to the Official .
OFFICIAL: Yes , please ?
LEON: Pardon me , I am very interested in what you just said you mean when an envoy goes back to Russia if they do n't like what he has done they put him out of the way ?
OFFICIAL: Not always look at me I 've een back twice .
LEON: Here 's my passport . Please give me a visa . I have to leave for Russia immediately .
OFFICIAL: Count Leon d'Algout a count ! a nobleman !
LEON: Do n't hold that against me please !
OFFICIAL: Why should an aristocrat want to go to Russia ?
LEON: Business .
OFFICIAL: What business ?
LEON: Private .
OFFICIAL: There is no privacy in Russia . This whole thing seems very suspicious . What 's the real reason ? If you eve want to get into Russia , take my advice confess !
LEON: Confess what ?
OFFICIAL: Are you sympathetic to the forme Czaristic government the White Russians ?
LEON: On the contrary I do n't want to have anything to do with them .
OFFICIAL: You believe in our cause ?
LEON: Oh I think it 's great ! Everyone works everyone contributes that 's what I want to do work ! I make my own bed you can call up my butler ! I do n't believe in the ight of the individual . I like the Bolshevik ideal everyone being the same . You just like me me just like you I use your comb you use my toothbrush oh , it 's a great life . Please give me that visa ! At this moment Swana enters .
SWANA: Hello , Leon darling !
LEON: Hello .
SWANA: After our talk last night I took it for granted that you would drop in here this morning . Knowing how difficult it is to get into Soviet Russia , I thought I might be of some assistance to you . May I introduce myself ? I am the Duchess Swana of Russia anothe Russia . The Official gasps in surprise .
LEON: Now , please , Swana .
SWANA: Count d'Algout was for several years my personal representative and if it is necessary to sign any affidavit for him I 'll be delighted .
LEON: That does it , Swana . Now you must n't miss your appointment with your hair-dresser .
SWANA: Just in case they do n't give you your visa to Russia I want you to know that I have signed a contract for my memoirs and rented a lovely little château in the Touraine , and if you feel the need of a change
LEON: Thank you , Swana . You are very gracious .
OFFICIAL: The Grand Duchess Swana active in the White Russian movement ?
LEON: Believe me , I have no connection with her any longer I swear I have n't !
OFFICIAL: But you had !
LEON: Listen , I want to be absolutely frank with you . I have no business in Moscow .
OFFICIAL: I think so too .
LEON: I want to see a friend of mine a very dear friend . It 's a personal matter which has nothing to do with politics or social philosophies . It 's a girl .
OFFICIAL: So it 's love which drags you to Moscow .
LEON: Yes !
OFFICIAL: No visa .
LEON: I must get into that country of yours !
OFFICIAL: Oh no . No visa .
LEON: That 's impossible ! Nobody has the ight . You ca n't do that ! If you do n't give me that visa
OFFICIAL: You 're going to force us huh ?
LEON: Now look here you advertise all over the world that you want people to go into your country and when someone tries to get in , you keep him out !
OFFICIAL: Why should I take a chance ?
LEON: On what ?
OFFICIAL: How do I know you do n't want to blow up a factory ?
LEON: What for why ?
OFFICIAL: Or a tunnel or a bridge
LEON: Suspicions nothing but suspicions ! That 's the trouble with you ! If you do n't let me in I 'll stand in front of this office of yours and warn people to keep away from Russia ! I 'll picket your whole country . The Official laughs in a superior way .
OFFICIAL: What ?
LEON: And you can tell the Kremlin that 's just the beginning ! He strides out .
OFFICIAL: No visa .
NINOTCHKA: Good evening , Anna .
ANNA: Good evening , Ninotchka .
NINOTCHKA: Are n't you late ?
ANNA: No , the opera starts an hour late tonight on account of the parade .
NINOTCHKA: Did n't you march ?
ANNA: They did n't let me . I am in disgrace . Last week at the performance of Carmen I played a sour note . The conducto got so excited he yelled , `` There 's sabotage in the string section ! ''
NINOTCHKA: Too bad you missed an inspiring day , Anna .
ANNA: I know my heart is sad but my feet are happy . When all the tanks and guns were roaring over the Red Square I sat here all by myself and played a Beethoven sonata . Not bad at all . Are you expecting someone ?
NINOTCHKA: A few friends just a little dinne party .
ANNA: What are you serving ?
NINOTCHKA: An omelet .
ANNA: An omelet ! Are n't you living a little above your ration ?
NINOTCHKA: Well , I 've saved up two eggs and each of my friends is bringing his own so we 'll manage .
ANNA: It just goes to prove the theory of our State . If you stand alone it means a boiled egg but if you 're true to the collective spirit and stick together you 've got an omelet . That reminds me have you heard the latest they 're telling about the Kremlin ?
NINOTCHKA: You should be more careful , Anna .
ANNA: And you too , Ninotchka .
NINOTCHKA: About what ?
ANNA: Ever since you have been back from Paris
NINOTCHKA: I have n't talked to anyone about Paris . I have n't said a word .
ANNA: That 's just it . It makes people feel queer . I dont ' want you to get in any trouble .
NINOTCHKA: I have nothing to hide .
ANNA: You should . I 'll show you .
NINOTCHKA: I see .
ANNA: You know how it is today all you have to do is wear a pair of silk stockings and they suspect you of counter-revolution .
NINOTCHKA: Thank you , Anna . I 'll dry it up here when I wash it next . I should hate to see our country endangered by my underwear .
ANNA: Ninotchka , you know I am your friend , you can trust me . Did you bring ack anything else ?
NINOTCHKA: No , I left everything in Paris . I just happened to be wearing this .
ANNA: Tell me what else did you have ?
NINOTCHKA: Well , a hat
ANNA: What was it like ?
NINOTCHKA: It was very silly . I would be ashamed to wear it here .
ANNA: As beautiful as that ? What else ? Come , tell me .
NINOTCHKA: An evening gown .
ANNA: Evening gown ?
NINOTCHKA: A dress you wear in the evening .
ANNA: What do you wear in the morning ?
NINOTCHKA: When you get up you put on a negligee , and then you change to a morning frock .
ANNA: You mean to tell me you wear a different dress for different times of the day ?
NINOTCHKA: Yes .
ANNA: Now , Ninotchka , you 're exaggerating .
NINOTCHKA: No , my dear , it is true . That 's how they live in the other world . Here we dress to have our bodies covered to keep warm .
ANNA: And there ?
NINOTCHKA: Well , sometimes they 're not completely covered but they do n't freeze .
ANNA: They must have wonderful materials to make a thing like this so soft something you do n't even see .
NINOTCHKA: You feel it , though .
ANNA: Ninotchka , I would n't bring this up if we were n't such good friends .
NINOTCHKA: What is it , Anna ?
ANNA: You know I told you that Pavlov and I are going to get married when he comes back from the maneuvers . Would it be asking too much
NINOTCHKA: You want this ?
ANNA: Just for the honeymoon .
NINOTCHKA: You can have it for good . It is my wedding present .
ANNA: Ninotchka ! Ninotchka !
NINOTCHKA: No music .
KOPALSKI: Well , we 're back home .
BULJANOFF: You know what they say there 's nothing like home .
IRANOFF: That 's right and we might as well face it .
NINOTCHKA: Come , now , you must not talk that way . You have to adjust yourselves . We must be brave .
IRANOFF: Brave that 's right .
BULJANOFF: Let 's be happy that we 're all alive .
IRANOFF: And that 's something we owe to Ninotchka .
KOPALSKI: If you had n't given Commissar Razinin such a wonderful report about us , who knows what would have happened ?
BULJANOFF: I can tell you exactly .
NINOTCHKA: Now let 's forget everything except that we 're together .
BULJANOFF: That 's right .
IRANOFF: Let 's do that .
KOPALSKI: It 's a real Paris reunion .
IRANOFF: If you close your eyes and listen to our voices we might be in Paris .
NINOTCHKA: Let 's not close our eyes . There are many good things to see here too .
BULJANOFF: I think I need my glasses .
KOPALSKI: A little more tact look how nicely she 's fixed the table all for us .
BULJANOFF: How nicely you 've fixed the table , Ninotchka .
IRANOFF: What a lovely room you have here .
BULJANOFF: How many families live here with you ?
NINOTCHKA: Only myself and two other girls . One is a cello player in the opera and the other a street-car conductor .
IRANOFF: Just three people in a room this size ? Whew !
KOPALSKI: And your own gas cooker ? That 's marvelous ! Naturally it 's not the Royal Suite
NINOTCHKA: Sssh ! Once and for all , we 're in Moscow !
KOPALSKI: Yes , there 's no doubt of that Just look out of the window and there it is .
NINOTCHKA: And it 's great ! Think what it was a few years ago and what it is now .
IRANOFF: She 's right anyhow let 's talk ourselves into it .
BULJANOFF: Just see how happy the people look from here .
KOPALSKI: Can you blame them ? at least the May Day parade is over .
BULJANOFF: That 's another thing it 's spring .
NINOTCHKA: The same spring we had in Paris . Just as good .
KOPALSKI: Even the swallows are back .
IRANOFF: Maybe that 's the same swallow we saw in Paris !
BULJANOFF: It is , Ninotchka ! It is ! He must have been in Paris ! You can see it in his whole attitude ! He just picked up a crumb of our black bread , shook his head , and dropped it .
KOPALSKI: If you asked him why he left France I bet he could n't name one good eason .
BULJANOFF: I should be a swallow ! Right now I would be sitting in front of the Café de Paris picking up flakes of French pastry that would melt in my ill .
NINOTCHKA: Now , comrades there is something etter in life than crumbs of French pastry .
KOPALSKI: Yes , a good piece of apfel strudel .
NINOTCHKA: We will get that we 'll get everything maybe a little bit later but we 'll get it We must be patient Finally we got the spring , did n't we ? We got the swallows , and you will get your apfel strudel too .
BULJANOFF: And if it is too late for you you children will eat it .
IRANOFF: Let 's forget the future let 's stop being sentimental let 's start that omelet .
KOPALSKI: That 's right . Here 's my egg . Iranoff unties his egg from his handkerchief .
IRANOFF: And here 's mine . He hands it to Ninotchka .
BULJANOFF: Comrades I 'm out of the omelet .
NINOTCHKA: Do n't worry there will be enough .
IRANOFF: Come , Ninotchka , let 's make it in eal Parisian style !
KOPALSKI: Let 's fill it with confitures , des prunes
BULJANOFF: des raisins de Madère , des framboises
IRANOFF: des petites fraises des bois de la crème de Bretagne
KOPALSKI: so it blows up that big what they call an Omelette Surprise !
BULJANOFF: And the surprise is there 's nothing in it .
KOPALSKI: I know , but if we ca n't put in all these wonderful things at least let 's put in some imagination . In that one omelet we 'll taste the whole of Paris !
IRANOFF: Sssh !
VLADIMIR: Comrade Yakushova , here , the postman left a letter for you . He hands her a letter and exits .
NINOTCHKA: It 's from Paris .
KOPALSKI: A bill ?
NINOTCHKA: From Leon .
IRANOFF: Bad news ?
NINOTCHKA: Look for yourselves .
KOPALSKI: Well , I think it 's getting late . Good night , Ninotchka .
IRANOFF: Thank you for a wonderful dinner . Ninotchka rises and shakes their hands .
NINOTCHKA: Good night , my friends .
BULJANOFF: They ca n't censor our memories , can they ?
RAZININ: Good morning , Comrade .
NINOTCHKA: Good morning , Comrade Commissar . Here is my report on the materials available for trading in the next four months .
RAZININ: Does this include the products of the Far Eastern provinces ?
NINOTCHKA: Yes , it does .
RAZININ: You mean you have finished the whole investigation ?
NINOTCHKA: Yes .
RAZININ: That 's marvelous . You must have worked day and night . Do n't you ever sleep ?
NINOTCHKA: I need very little sleep . We must be extremely careful what goods we take in exchange . I have already started a survey of our most urgent needs .
RAZININ: Well , Comrade , I am afraid you will have to turn over that work to someone else .
NINOTCHKA: May I ask why ?
RAZININ: Please sit down . Ninotchka sits .
NINOTCHKA: Thank you .
RAZININ: Well , Comrade , have you heard from your friends Kopalski , Buljanoff , and Iranoff ?
NINOTCHKA: No .
RAZININ: I have n't either , but I 've heard about them . You must realize it was only on the strength of your Paris eport that I sent them to Constantinople ; without that I neve would have trusted them on a mission as important as the fur deal .
NINOTCHKA: May I ask what has happened ?
RAZININ: As soon as our representatives go to a foreign country they seem to lose all sense of balance . If I told you what 's going on in Constantinople ight now you would n't believe it . Those three have been sitting there for six weeks and have n't sold a piece of fur . This anonymous report was sent me . They are dragging the good name of our country through every café and night club . Here `` How can the Bolshevik cause gain espect among the Moslems if you three representatives , Buljanoff , Iranoff , and Kopalski , get so drunk that they throw a carpet out of thei hotel window and complain to the management that it did n't fly ? ''
NINOTCHKA: Oh , they should n't do such things . Are you sure this report is correct ?
RAZININ: It gives details which could n't be invented . Naturally I want to verify it and that 's why I need you .
NINOTCHKA: You want me to go to Constantinople ?
RAZININ: Yes leaving immediately .
NINOTCHKA: I appreciate the confidence you show in me , but I must ask you to entrust someone else with this mission . I should hate to interrupt my present work . I am positive that my survey is more important than finding out whether three of our comrades have een drinking some extra glasses of champagne .
RAZININ: That is for me to decide , Comrade Yakushova .
NINOTCHKA: I am sorry , I do n't want to overstep my position but please do n't send me .
RAZININ: I do n't understand .
NINOTCHKA: How can I make myself clear It is difficult to express but I 'd rathe not go to foreign countries any more . Please , Comrade let me stay here let me finish my work I am in the hythm of it now I do n't want to go away . I do n't want to be sent into that foreign atmosphere again . It throws one out of gear . Let me finish my work I have concentrated everything in it Please do n't make me go .
RAZININ: Please do n't waste my time , Comrade . Do your duty . Good-by .
NINOTCHKA: I will do my best . She exits , as we
KOPALSKI: How do you like it , Ninotchka ? Is n't it wonderful ?
NINOTCHKA: But Buljanoff , Iranoff , Kopalski
IRANOFF: Now , please , Ninotchka , do n't start figuring it out in cows .
NINOTCHKA: You 've done it again and I am esponsible . How can you forget yourselves this way ? You were sent here to make money , not to spend it .
IRANOFF: Buljanoff , she still has those old- fashioned Bolshevik ideas .
BULJANOFF: It is high time you got out of Russia .
NINOTCHKA: I must be stern with you .
KOPALSKI: That 's our old Ninotchka !
NINOTCHKA: Do n't forget , the day will come when you will have to face Razinin .
BULJANOFF: Good old Razinin ! Is he still alive ? How does he manage ?
NINOTCHKA: But , Comrades
KOPALSKI: We are not comrades any more we are friends , Ninotchka .
BULJANOFF: Imagine , we do n't have to whispe any longer .
IRANOFF: We can say whatever we want . We can shout we can complain Look The service in this hotel is terrible ! See ? Nobody comes nobody pays any attention . That 's freedom .
BULJANOFF: No , that 's bad management .
NINOTCHKA: Is it possible to bring you back to eality for a moment ? I must have a complete report of your negotiations and a detailed expense account .
BULJANOFF: Do n't ask for it , Ninotchka . There is a Turkish proverb which says , `` If something smells bad , why put you nose in it ? ''
NINOTCHKA: And there is a Russian saying `` The cat who has cream on his whiskers had better find good excuses . ''
BULJANOFF: With our cream situation what it is , it is Russia which should apologize to the cats .
NINOTCHKA: Friends friends , Buljanoff , Iranoff
KOPALSKI: and Kopalski .
NINOTCHKA: Do n't make it difficult for me . This is no more a pleasure trip for me than it is for you .
IRANOFF: That was our idea when we first came . All we thought we would get out of this trip was a Turkish bath , but we learned better .
KOPALSKI: Ninotchka , we are in the magic East , the country of Aladdin and His Lamp
IRANOFF: Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves into one single hour you can crowd a thousand and one nights .
BULJANOFF: All you have to do is say `` open sesame . ''
NINOTCHKA: I do n't know how I can get you out of it this time . How will it end ? What will happen to you ?
BULJANOFF: Shall we tell her ?
NINOTCHKA: Guest ?
BULJANOFF: We have opened a restaurant
IRANOFF: we have a wonderful electric sign `` Dine With Buljanof , Iranoff , and Kopalski . ''
NINOTCHKA: You mean you are deserting Russia ?
KOPALSKI: Do n't call it desertion . Our little estaurant that is our Russia the Russia of borscht , the Russia of eef Stroganoff , blinis with sou cream
IRANOFF: the Russia of piroshki people will eat and love it .
BULJANOFF: We are not only serving good food , we are serving our country we are making friends .
NINOTCHKA: Who gave you this idea ? What is esponsible for all this ?
KOPALSKI: There 's something in Constantinople something irresistible .
IRANOFF: it is in the air it may come around the corner as you walk down the street .
BULJANOFF: it may step out of a bazaar it may wait for you in a corridor it may hide in the shadow of a minaret .
KOPALSKI: Right now it 's on the balcony .
LEON: They would n't let me in so I had to get you out .
NINOTCHKA: So you 're behind all this . I should have known .
LEON: Trying to keep me away from you ! It could n't be done . Naturally I could n't go on forever punching passport officials in the nose but I found a way , did n't I ? Darling , I had to see you . I wrote and wrote but all my letters came back .
NINOTCHKA: The one I got they would n't let me ead . It began , `` Ninotchka , my darling , '' and ended , `` Yours , Leon . ''
LEON: I wo n't tell you what came between I 'll prove it . It will take a long time , Ninotchka at least a lifetime .
NINOTCHKA: But , Leon , I am only here for a few days .
LEON: If you do n't stay with me , I 'll have to continue my fight . I 'll travel wherever Russian commissions are . I 'll turn them all into Buljanoffs , Iranoffs , and Kopalskis . The world will be crowded with Russian estaurants . I 'll depopulate Russia . Once you saved your country by going ack . This time you can save it by staying here .
NINOTCHKA: Well , when it is a choice between my personal interest and the good of my country , how can I waver ? No one shall say Ninotchka was a bad Russian . Leon takes her in his arms , they kiss as we

MOSS: Too late . I spent it about a million and a half on whores and whiskey and the rest of it I just sort of blew it in . Wells ' smile stays in place .
WELLS: How do you know he 's not on his way to Odessa ? Moss stares at him . A beat .
MOSS: Why would he go to Odessa ?

WELLS: No no . No . You do n't understand . You ca n't make a deal with him . Even if you gave him the money he 'd still kill you . He 's a peculiar man . You could even say that he has principles .

CARLA JEAN: He can take all comers . Bell looks at her . After a beat
BELL: You know Charlie Walser ? Has the place east of Sanderson ? She shakes her head , shrugs .
CARLA JEAN: Why you tellin ' me that , Sheriff ?
BELL: I do n't know . My mind wanders .
CHIGURH: Hello Carson . Let 's go to your room .

CHIGURH: I do know to a certainty . And you know what 's going to happen now . You should admit your situation . There would be more dignity in it .
WELLS: You go to hell . A beat .
CHIGURH: Let me ask you something . If the ule you followed brought you to this , of what use was the rule ? Another beat .
WELLS: Do you have any idea how goddamn crazy you are ?
CHIGURH: You mean the nature of this conversation ?
WELLS: I mean the nature of you .

WILLIAM: Spike !
SPIKE: Even he . Hey , you could n't help me with an incredibly important decision , could you ?
WILLIAM: This is important in comparison to , let 's say , whether they should cancel third world debt ?
SPIKE: That 's right I 'm at last going out on a date with the great Janine and I just want to be sure I 've picked the ight t-shirt .
WILLIAM: What are the choices ?
SPIKE: Well wait for it First there 's this one
WILLIAM: Yes might make it hard to strike a eally romantic note .
SPIKE: Point taken .
WILLIAM: Yes she might think you do n't have true love on your mind .
SPIKE: Would n't want that Okay just one more .
WILLIAM: Well , yes , that 's perfect . Well done .
SPIKE: Thanks . Great . Wish me luck .
WILLIAM: Good luck .
MARTIN: Shall I go get a cappuccino ? Ease the pain .
WILLIAM: Yes , better get me a half . All I can afford .
MARIN: I get your logic . Demi-capu coming up .
WILLIAM: Can I help you ?
ANNA: No , thanks . I 'll just look around .
WILLIAM: Fine .
ANNA: Really ?
WILLIAM: Yes . This one though is very good . He picks up a book on the counter .
ANNA: Thanks . I 'll think about it .
WILLIAM: If you could just give me a second .
THIEF: Yes .
WILLIAM: Bad news .
THIEF: What ?
WILLIAM: We 've got a security camera in this it of the shop .
THIEF: So ?
WILLIAM: So , I saw you put that book down you trousers .
THIEF: What book ?
WILLIAM: The one down your trousers .
THIEF: I have n't got a book down my trousers .
WILLIAM: Right well , then we have something of an impasse . I tell you what I 'll call the police and , what can I say ? If I 'm wrong about the whole ook-down-the-trousers scenario , I eally apologize .
THIEF: Okay what if I did have a book down my trousers ?
WILLIAM: Well , ideally , when I went back to the desk , you 'd remove the Cadogan guide to Bali from your trousers , and either wipe it and put it back , o uy it . See you in a sec .
ANNA: No , that 's fine . I was going to steal one myself but now I 've changed my mind . Signed by the author , I see .
WILLIAM: Yes , we could n't stop him . If you can find an unsigned copy , it 's worth an absolute fortune . She smiles . Suddenly the thief is there .
THIEF: Excuse me .
ANNA: Yes .
THIEF: Can I have your autograph ?
ANNA: What 's your name ?
THIEF: Rufus .
ANNA: Well , that 's the signature and above , it says 'Dear Rufus you elong in jail . '
THIEF: Nice one . Would you like my phone number ?
ANNA: Tempting but no , thank you . Thief leaves .
WILLIAM: Oh right on second thoughts maybe it was n't that bad . Actually it 's a sort of masterpiece really . None of those childish keba stories you get in so many travel ooks these days . And I 'll throw in one of these for free . He drops in one of the signed books .
ANNA: Thanks .
MARTIN: Cappuccino as ordered .
WILLIAM: Thanks . I do n't think you 'll believe who was just in here .
MARTIN: Who ? Someone famous ?
WILLIAM: No . No-one no-one . They set about drinking their coffees .
MARTIN: Would be exciting if someone famous did come into the shop though , would n't it ? Do you know this is pretty incredible actually I once saw Ringo Starr . Or at least I think it was Ringo . It might have been that broke from 'Fiddler On The Roof , ' Toppy .
WILLIAM: Topol .
MARTIN: That 's right Topol .
WILLIAM: But Ringo Starr does n't look anything like Topol .
MARTIN: No , well he was quite a long way away .
WILLIAM: So it could have been neither of them ?
MARTIN: I suppose so .
WILLIAM: Right . It 's not a classic anecdotes , is it ?
MARTIN: Not classic , no .
WILLIAM: Right want another one ?
MARTIN: Yes . No , wait let 's go crazy I 'll have an orange juice .
ANNA: Oh Jesus .
WILLIAM: Here , let me help .
ANNA: What are you doing ? ! He jumps back .
WILLIAM: Nothing , nothing Look , I live just over the street you could get cleaned up .
ANNA: No thank you . I need to get my ca ack .
WILLIAM: I also have a phone . I 'm confident that in five minutes we can have you spick and span and back on the street again in the non-prostitute sense obviously .
ANNA: Okay . So what does 'just over the street ' mean give it to me in yards .
WILLIAM: Eighteen yards . That 's my house there .
ANNA: No thanks .
WILLIAM: Coffee ?
ANNA: No .
WILLIAM: Orange juice probably not .
ANNA: Really , no .
WILLIAM: Would you like something to nibble apricots , soaked in honey quite why , no one knows because it stops them tasting of apricots , and makes them taste like honey , and if you wanted honey , you 'd just buy honey , instead of apricots , but nevertheless there we go yours if you want them .
ANNA: No .
WILLIAM: Do you always say 'no ' to everything ? Pause . She looks at him deep .
ANNA: No . I better be going . Thanks for you help .
WILLIAM: You 're welcome and , may I also say heavenly .
ANNA: Thank you .
WILLIAM: Yes . Well . My pleasure . He guides her towards the door .
ANNA: I forgot my bag .
WILLIAM: Oh right .
ANNA: Thanks . Well
WILLIAM: I apologize for the 'surreal but nice ' comment . Disaster
ANNA: Do n't worry about it . I thought the apricot and honey business was the eal lowpoint .
WILLIAM: Oh my God . My flatmate . I 'm sorry there 's no excuse for him . Spike walks in .
SPIKE: Hi .
ANNA: Hi .
WILLIAM: Hi .
SPIKE: I 'm just going to go into the kitchen to get some food and then I 'm going to tell you a story that will make you alls shrink to the size of raisins . And leaves them in the corridor .
ANNA: Probably best not tell anyone about this .
WILLIAM: Right . No one . I mean , I 'll tell myself sometimes but do n't worry I wo n't believe it .
ANNA: Bye .
SPIKE: There 's something wrong with this yogurt .
WILLIAM: It 's not yogurt it 's mayonnaise .
SPIKE: Well , there you go . On for a video fest tonight ? I 've got some absolute classic .
MICHAEL: Smile .
ANNA: No .
MICHAEL: Smile .
ANNA: I 've got nothing to smile about .
MICHAEL: Okay in about 7 seconds , I 'm going to ask you to marry me .
SPIKE: Imagine somewhere in the world there 's a man who 's allowed to kiss her .
WILLIAM: Yes , she is fairly fabulous .
MR. SMITH: Do you have any books by Dickens ?
WILLIAM: No , we 're a travel bookshop . We only sell travel books .
MR. SMITH: Oh right . How about that new John Grisham thriller ?

WILLIAM: Martin your customer .
MARTIN: Can I help you ?
SPIKE: Hey .
WILLIAM: Hi
SPIKE: Ahm combination of factors really . No clean clothes
WILLIAM: There never will be , you know , unless you actually clean your clothes .
SPIKE: Right . Vicious circle . And then I was like rooting around in your things , and found this , and I thought cool . Kind of spacey .
WILLIAM: No , they were prescription , so I could see all the fishes properly .
SPIKE: Groovy . You should do more of this stuff .
WILLIAM: So any messages ?
SPIKE: Yeh , I wrote a couple down .
WILLIAM: Two ? That 's it ?
SPIKE: You want me to write down all you messages ? William closes his eyes in exasperation .
WILLIAM: Who were the ones you did n't write down from ?
SPIKE: Ahm let 's see ahm . No . Gone completely . Oh no , wait . There was one from your mum she said do n't forget lunch and her leg 's hurting again .
WILLIAM: Right . No one else ?
SPIKE: Absolutely not . Spike leans back and relaxes .
WILLIAM: What did she say ?
SPIKE: Well , it was genuinely bizarre she said , hi it 's Anna and then she said , call me at the Ritz and then gave herself a completely different name .
WILLIAM: Which was ?
SPIKE: Absolutely no idea . Remembering one name 's bad enough
WILLIAM: Hello .
RITZ MAN: I 'm sorry , we do n't have anyone of that name here , sir .
WILLIAM: No , that 's right I know that . She said she 's using another name but the problem is she left the message with my flatmate , which was a serious mistake .
RITZ MAN: Yes , sir . I have him in my mind .
WILLIAM: And then double it and that is the what can I say git I 'm living with and he can not remember
SPIKE: Try 'Flintstone . '
WILLIAM: What ?
SPIKE: I think she said her name was 'Flintstone . '
WILLIAM: Does 'Flintstone ' mean anything to you ?
RITZ MAN: I 'll put you right through , sir . Flintstone is indeed the magic word .
WILLIAM: Oh my God . He practices how to sound .

WILLIAM: No they 're for my grandmother . She 's in a hospital nearby . Thought I 'd kill two birds with one stone .
TARQUIN: I 'm sorry . Which hospital ? Pause . He 's in trouble .
WILLIAM: Do you mind me not saying it 's a ather distressing disease and the name of the hospital rather gives it away .
TARQUIN: Oh sure . Of course .
KAREN: Mr. Thacker . Saved by the bell .
WILLIAM: Hi .
ANNA: Hello .
WILLIAM: I brought these , but clearly There are lots of other flowers in the room .
ANNA: Oh no , ho these are great .
WILLIAM: Sorry about not ringing back . The whole two-names concept was totally too much for my flatman 's pea-sized intellect .
ANNA: No , it 's a stupid privacy thing . I always choose a cartoon character last time out , I was Mrs. Bambi .
JEREMY: Everything okay ?
ANNA: Yes , thanks .
JEREMY: And you are from 'Horse and Hound ' magazine ? William nods .
ANNA: Is that so ?

WILLIAM: Absolutely fine about it . Re-enter Jeremy .
JEREMY: Do remember that Miss Scott is also keen to talk about her next project , which is shooting later in the summer .
WILLIAM: Oh yes excellent . Ahm any horses in that one ? Or hounds , of course . Ou eaders are equally intrigued by both species .
ANNA: It takes place on a submarine .
WILLIAM: Yes . Right But if there were horses , would you be riding them yourself o would you be getting a stunt horse person double sort of thing ? Jeremy exits .
ANNA: And what happens next in the dream ? It 's a challenge .
WILLIAM: Well , I suppose in the dream dream scenario . I just ahm , change my personality , because you can do that in dreams , and walk across and kiss the girl but you know it 'll never happen .
JEREMY: Time 's up , I 'm afraid . Sorry it was so short . Did you get what you wanted ?
WILLIAM: Very nearly .
JEREMY: Maybe time for one last question ?
WILLIAM: Right . Jeremy goes out it 's their last seconds .
ANNA: Yes .
WILLIAM: Thank you . You are 'Horse and Hound 's ' favorite actress . You and Black Beauty . Tied .

BERNIE: Splendid . I 'm actually in the stock- market , so not really similar fields , though I have done some amateur stuff P.G . Wodehouse , you know farce , all that . 'Ooh careful there , vicar . ' Always imagined it 's a pretty tough job , though , acting . I mean the wages are a scandal , are n't they ?
ANNA: Well , they can be .
BERNIE: I see friends from university clever chaps been in the business longer than you they 're scraping y on seven , eight thousand a year . It 's no life . What sort of acting do you do ?
ANNA: Films mainly .
BERNIE: Oh splendid . Well done . How 's the pay in movies ? I mean , last film you did , what did you get paid ?

BELLA: Oh , it 's just down the corridor on the right .
HONEY: I 'll show you .

BELLA: Yup .
BERNIE: Oh God . Oh God . Oh Goddy God .
HONEY: I do n't believe it . I walked into the loo with her . I was still talking when she started unbuttoning her jeans She had to ask me to leave .
BELLA: What do you think of the guinea fowl ?
ANNA: I 'm a vegetarian .
BELLA: Oh God .
MAX: Having you here , Anna , firmly establishes what I 've long suspected , that we really are the most desperate hot of under-achievers .
BERNIE: Shame !
MAX: I 'm not saying it 's a bad thing , in fact , I think it 's something we should take pride in . I 'm going to give the last brownie as a prize to the saddest act here .
WILLIAM: Bernie .
BERNIE: Well , obviously it 's me , is n't it I work in the City in a job I do n't understand and everyone keeps getting promoted above me . I have n't had a girlfriends since puberty and , well , the long and short of it is , nobody fancies me , and if these cheeks get any chubbier , they never will .
HONEY: Nonsense . I fancy you . Or I did efore you got so far .
MAX: You see and unless I 'm much mistaken , your job still pays you rather a lot of money , while Honey here , she earns nothing flogging her guts out at London 's seediest record store .
HONEY: Yes . And I do n't have hair I 've got feathers , and I 've got funny goggly eyes , and I 'm attracted to cruel men and no one 'll ever marry me because my oosies have actually started shrinking .
MAX: You see incredibly sad .
BELLA: On the other hand , her best friend is Anna Scott .
HONEY: That 's true , I ca n't deny it . She needs me , what can I say ?
BELLA: And most of her limbs work . Whereas I 'm stuck in its thing day and night , in a house full of ramps . And to add insult to serious injury I 've totally given up smoking , my favourite thing , and the truth is we ca n't have a baby . Dead silence .
WILLIAM: Bella .
BERNIE: No . Not true
BELLA: C'est la vie We 're lucky in lots of ways , but Surely it 's worth a ownie .
MAX: Well , I do n't know . Look at William . Very unsuccessful professionally . Divorced . Used to e handsome , now kind of squidgy around the edges and absolutely certain never to hear from Anna again after she 's heard that his nickname at school was Floppy .
WILLIAM: So I get the brownie ?
MAX: I think you do , yes .
ANNA: Wait a minute . What about me ?
MAX: I 'm sorry ? You think you deserve the ownie ?
ANNA: Well a shot at it .
WILLIAM: You 'll have to prove it . This is a great brownie and I 'm going to fight for it . State your claim .
ANNA: Well , I 've been on a diet since I was nineteen , which means basically I 've een hungry for a decade . I 've had a sequence of not nice boyfriends one of whom hit me and every time my heart gets broken it gets splashed across the newspapers as entertainment . Meantime , it cost millions to get me looking like this
HONEY: Really ?
ANNA: Really and one day , not long from now
MAX: Nah ! ! ! Nice try , gorgeous but you do n't fool anyone .
WILLIAM: Pathetic effort to hog the brownie .
ANNA: That was such a great evening .
MAX: I 'm delighted .
ANNA: And may I say that 's a gorgeous tie .
MAX: Now you 're lying .
ANNA: You 're right . I told you I was bad at acting . Max loves this .
BELLA: And you . I 'll wait till you 've gone efore I tell him you 're a vegetarian .
MAX: No !
ANNA: Night , night , Honey .
HONEY: I 'm so sorry about the loo thing . I meant to leave but I just look , ring me if you need someone to go shopping with . I know lots of nice , cheap places not that money necessarily nice to meet you . And Honey gives her a huge hug .
ANNA: You too from now on you are my style guru .
BERNIE: Love your work . They move to the door and wave goodbye .
WILLIAM: Sorry they always do that when I leave the house .
ANNA: Floppy , huh ?
WILLIAM: It 's the hair ! It 's to do with the hair .
ANNA: Why is she in a wheelchair ?
WILLIAM: It was an accident about eighteen months ago .
ANNA: And the pregnancy thing is that to do with the accident ?
WILLIAM: You know , I 'm not sure . I do n't think they 'd tried for kids before , as fate would have it . They walk in silence for a moment . Then
ANNA: Too complicated .
WILLIAM: That 's fine .
ANNA: Busy tomorrow ?
WILLIAM: I thought you were leaving .
ANNA: I was .
WILLIAM: Gardens . All these streets round here have these mysterious communal gardens in the middle of them . They 're like little villages .
ANNA: Let 's go in .
WILLIAM: Ah no that 's the point they 're private villages only the people who live round the edges are allowed in .
ANNA: You abide by rules like that ?
WILLIAM: Ahm
ANNA: What did you say ?
WILLIAM: Nothing .
ANNA: Yes , you did .
WILLIAM: No , I did n't .
ANNA: You said 'whoopsidaisies . ' Tiny pause .
WILLIAM: I do n't think so . No one has said 'whoopsidaisies , ' do they I mean unless they 're
ANNA: There 's no 'unless . ' No one has said `` whoopsidaisies '' for fifty years and even then it was only little girls with blonde ringlets .
WILLIAM: Exactly . Here we go again . He fails , and unfortunately , spontaneously
ANNA: Step aside . She starts to climb .
WILLIAM: Actually be careful Anna it 's harder than it looks But she 's already almost over .
ANNA: Come on , Flops .
WILLIAM: Now seriously what in the world in this garden could make that ordeal worthwhile ?
ANNA: 'For June , who loved this garden from Joseph who always sat beside her . '
WILLIAM: Bollocks , bollocks , bollocks . Have you seen my glasses ?
SPIKE: No , 'fraid not .
WILLIAM: Bollocks . This happens every time I go to the cinema . Average day , my glasses are everywhere everywhere I look , glasses . But the moment I need them they disappear . It 's one of life 's eal cruelties .
SPIKE: That 's compared to , like , earthquakes in the Far East o testicular cancer ?
WILLIAM: Oh shit , is that the time ? I have to go .
SPIKE: You 're welcome . Did you find them ?
WILLIAM: Sort of .
ANNA: So who left who ?
WILLIAM: She left me .
ANNA: Why ?
WILLIAM: She saw through me .
ANNA: Uh-oh . That 's not good .
LAWRENCE: No - No- No ! Give me Anna Scott any day . William and Anna look at each other .
GERALD: I did n't like that last film of hers . Fast asleep from the moment the lights went down . Again Anna reacts .
LAWRENCE: Do n't really care what the films are like . Any film with her in it fine by me .
GERALD: No not my type at all really . I prefer that other one blonde sweet looking has an orgasm every time you take her out for a cup of coffee . Anna mouths 'Meg Ryan . '
LAWRENCE: Meg Ryan .
GERALD: Drug-induced , I hear I believe she 's actually in rehab as we speak .
LAWRENCE: Whatever , she 's so clearly up for it . Anna 's twinkle fades .
WILLIAM: Right , that 's it .
LAWRENCE: Can I help you ?
WILLIAM: Well , yes , I wish I had n't overheard your conversation but I did and I just think , you know
LAWRENCE: Oh sod off , mate . What are you , he dad ?
WILLIAM: I 'm sorry .
ANNA: No , that 's fine . I love that you tried time was I 'd have done the same . They walk on and then
LAWRENCE: Oh my God
ANNA: I 'm sorry about my friend he 's very sensitive .
LAWRENCE: No , look , I 'm sorry
ANNA: Please , please let 's just leave it there . I 'm sure you meant no harm , and I 'm sure it was just friendly anter and I 'm sure you dicks are all the size of peanuts . A perfect match for the size of your brains . Enjoy your meal . The tuna 's really good .
GERALD: You prick .
ANNA: I should n't have done that . I should n't have done that .
WILLIAM: No , you were brilliant
ANNA: I 'm rash and I 'm stupid and what am I doing with you ?
WILLIAM: I do n't know , I 'm afraid .
ANNA: I do n't know either . They have arrived at the end of the arcade .
WILLIAM: There seem to be lots of reasons why I should n't .
ANNA: There are lots of reasons . Do you want to come up ? His look says yes .
WILLIAM: Hi . He kisses her gently on the cheek .
ANNA: You 've got to go .
WILLIAM: Why ?
ANNA: Because my boyfriend , who I thought was in America , is in fact in the next room .
WILLIAM: Your boyfriend ? He is duly shocked . She 's trying to be calm .
ANNA: Yes
WILLIAM: Ahm room service .
JEFF: How you doing ? I thought you guys all wore those penguin coats .
WILLIAM: Well , yes usually I 'd just changed to go home but I thought I 'd just deal with this final call .
JEFF: Oh great . Could you do me a favou and try to get us some really cold water up here ?
WILLIAM: I 'll see what I can do .
JEFF: Still , not sparkling .
WILLIAM: Absolutely . Ice cold still water .
JEFF: Unless it 's illegal in the UK to serve liquids below room temperature I do n't want you going to jail just to satisfy my whims
WILLIAM: No , I 'm sure it 'll be fine .
JEFF: And maybe you could just adios the dishes and empty the trash .
WILLIAM: Right .
ANNA: Really do n't do that I 'm sure this is not his job .
JEFF: I 'm sorry . Is this a problem ?
WILLIAM: Ah no . It 's fine .
JEFF: What 's your name ?
WILLIAM: Ahm Bernie . Jeff slips him a fiver .
JEFF: Thank you , Bernie . Hey nice surprise , or nasty surprise ?
ANNA: Nice surprise . He kisses her .
JEFF: Liar . She hates surprises . What are you ordering ?
ANNA: I have n't decided .
JEFF: Well , do n't over-do it . I do n't want people saying , 'There goes that famous actor with the big , fat girlfriend . '' He wanders off taking off his t-shirt .
WILLIAM: I better leave . Anna just nods .
ANNA: I 'm sorry I do n't know what to say .
WILLIAM: I think goodbye is traditional .
SPIKE: Come on open up this is me Spikey I 'm in contact with some quite important spiritual vibrations . What 's wrong ?
WILLIAM: Well , okay . There 's this girl
SPIKE: Aha ! I 'd been getting a female vibe . Good . Speak on , dear friend .
WILLIAM: She 's someone I just ca n't someone who self-evidently ca n't be mine and it 's as if I 've taken love-heroin and now I ca n't even have it again . I 've opened Pandora 's box . And there 's trouble inside . Spike nods thoughtfully .
SPIKE: Yeh . Yeh tricky tricky I knew a girl at school called Pandora never got to see her box though . He roars with laughter . William smiles .
WILLIAM: Thanks . Yes very helpful .
MAX: You did n't know she had a boyfriend ?
WILLIAM: No did you ?
MAX: Let 's face facts . This was always a no-go situation . Anna 's a goddess and you know what happens to mortals who get involved with the gods .
WILLIAM: Buggered ?
MAX: Every time . But do n't despair I think I have the solution to you problems .
WILLIAM: Really ? They all look to him for wise words .
MAX: Her name is Tessa and she works in the contracts department . The hair , I admit , is unfashionable frizzy ut she 's as bright as a button and kisses like a nymphomaniac on death ow . Apparently .
TESSA: Oh hello , you 're in a wheelchair .
BELLA: That 's right .
MAX: And this is William .
TESSA: Hello William . Max has told me everything about you .
WILLIAM: Has he ?
MAX: Wine ?
TESSA: Oh yes please . Come on , Willie , let 's get sloshed .
MAX: Keziah some woodcock ?
KEZIAH: No , thank you I 'm a fruitarian .
MAX: I do n't realize that .
WILLIAM: And ahm what 's a fruitarian exactly ?
KEZIAH: We believe that fruits and vegetables have feelings so we think cooking is cruel . We only eat things that have actually fallen from the tree or bush that are , in fact , dead already .
WILLIAM: Right . Right . Interesting stuff . So these carrots
KEZIAH: Have been murdered , yes .
WILLIAM: Murdered ? Poor carrots . How beastly .
ROSIE: Delicious coffee .
MAX: Thank you . I 'm sorry about the lamb .
ROSIE: No I thought it was really , you know , interesting .
WILLIAM: Interesting means inedible .
ROSIE: Really inedible yes that 's right . They all laugh . It 's going very well .
WILLIAM: Yes . That would be great .
MAX: Well ?
WILLIAM: She 's perfect , perfect .
BELLA: And ?
WILLIAM: I think you have forgotten what an unusual situation you have here to find someone you actually love , who 'll love you the chances are always miniscule . Look at me not counting the American I 've only loved two girls in my whole life , oth total disasters .
MAX: That 's not fair .
WILLIAM: No really , one of them marries me and then leaves me quicker than you can say Indiana Jones and the other , who seriously ought to have known etter , casually marries my best friend .
BELLA: Still loves you though .
WILLIAM: In a depressingly asexual way .
BELLA: I never fancied you much actually They all roar with laughter .
WILLIAM: Oh no this is just getting worse . I am going to find myself , 30 years from now , still on this couch .
BELLA: Do you want to stay ?
WILLIAM: Why not all that awaits me at home is a masturbating Welshman .
ANNA: Hi . Can I come in ?
WILLIAM: Come in .
ANNA: They were taken years ago I know it was well , I was poor and it happens a lot that 's not an excuse but to make things worse , it now appears someone was filming me as well . So what was a stupid photo- shoot now looks like a porno film . And well the pictures have been solid and they 're everywhere . William shakes his head .
WILLIAM: This is the place .
ANNA: Thank you . I 'm just in London for two days but , with your papers , it 's the worse place to be . She 's very shaken .
WILLIAM: Do n't think about it . We 'll sort it out . Now what would you like tea bath ?
ANNA: A bath would be great .
SPIKE: Christ alive brilliant fantastic . magnificent
ANNA: You must be Spike .
SPIKE: Just checking .
ANNA: I 'm really sorry about last time . He just flew in I had no idea in fact , I had no idea if he 'd ever fly in again .
WILLIAM: No , that 's fine . It 's not often one has the opportunity to adios the plates of a major Hollywood star . It was a thrill for me . How is he ?
ANNA: I do n't know . It got to the point where I could n't remember any of the reasons I loved him . And you and love ?
WILLIAM: Well , there 's a question without an interesting answer .
ANNA: I have thought about you .
WILLIAM: Oh no no no . He does n't think she has to talk about this .
ANNA: Just anytime I 've tried to keep things normal with anyone normal it 's been a disaster .
WILLIAM: I appreciate that absolutely . Is that the film you 're doing ?
ANNA: Yes start in L.A. on Tuesday .
WILLIAM: Would you like me to take you through your lines ?
ANNA: Would you ? It 's all talk , talk , talk .
WILLIAM: Hand it over . Basic plot ?
ANNA: I 'm a difficult but brilliant junio officer who in about twenty minutes will save the world from nuclea disaster .
WILLIAM: Well done you .
ANNA: 'No , turn over 4 TRS 's and tell them we need radar feedback before the KFT 's eturn at 19 hundred then inform the Pentagon that we 'll be needing black star cover from ten hundred through 12.15 ' and do n't you dare say one word about how many mistakes I made in that speech or I 'll pelt you with olives .
WILLIAM: 'Very well , captain I 'll pass that on straightaway . '
ANNA: 'Thank you . ' How many mistake did I make ?
WILLIAM: Eleven .
ANNA: Damn . 'And Wainwright '
WILLIAM: Cartwright .
ANNA: 'Cartwright , Wainwright , whateve your name is , I promised little Jimmy I 'd be home for his birthday could you get a message through that I may e a little late . '
WILLIAM: 'Certainly . And little Johnny ? '
ANNA: My son 's name is Johnny ?
WILLIAM: Yup .
ANNA: Well , get a message through to him too .
WILLIAM: Brilliant . Word perfect I 'd say .
ANNA: What do you think ?
WILLIAM: Gripping . It 's not Jane Austen , it 's not Henry James , but it 's gripping .
ANNA: You think I should do Henry James instead ?
WILLIAM: I 'm sure you 'd be great in Henry James . But , you know this writer 's pretty damn good too .
ANNA: Yes I mean you never get anyone in 'Wings of a Dove ' having the nerve to say 'inform the Pentagon that we need black star cover . '
WILLIAM: And I think the book is the poorer fo it .
ANNA: I ca n't believe you have that picture on your wall .
WILLIAM: You like Chagall ?
ANNA: I do . It feels like how being in love should be . Floating through a dark lue sky .
WILLIAM: With a goat playing a violin .
ANNA: Yes happiness would n't be happiness without a violin-playing goat . Spike enters with three pizzas .
SPIKE: Voila . Carnival Calypso , for the Queen of Notting Hill pepperoni , pineapple and a little more pepperoni .
ANNA: Fantastic .
WILLIAM: I do n't mention that Anna 's a vegetarian , did I ?
SPIKE: I have some parsnip stew from last week . If I just peel the skin off , it 'll be perfect .
ANNA: You 've got big feet .
WILLIAM: Yes . Always have had .
ANNA: You know what they say about men with ig feet ?
WILLIAM: No . What 's that ?
ANNA: Big feet large shoes . He laughs .
WILLIAM: You actually have clauses in you contact about nudity ?
ANNA: Definitely . 'You may show the dent at the top of the artist 's buttocks but neither cheek . In the event of a stunt person being used , the artist must have full consultation . '
WILLIAM: You have a stunt bottom ?
ANNA: I could have a stunt bottom , yes .
WILLIAM: Would you be tempted to go for a slightly better bottom than your own ?
ANNA: Definitely . Ths is important stuff .
WILLIAM: It 's one hell of a job . What do you put on your passport ? Profession Mel Gibson 's bottom .
ANNA: Actually , Mel does his own ass work . Why would n't he ? It 's delicious .
WILLIAM: The ice cream or Mel Gibson 's bottom ?
ANNA: Both .
WILLIAM: Well , thank you . Anyway time for bed . Or sofa-bed .
ANNA: Right .
WILLIAM: Oh my God Hello .
SPIKE: Hello . I wonder if I could have a little word . He drifts round the corner , half-naked .
WILLIAM: Spike .
SPIKE: I do n't want to interfere , or anything but she 's split up from her boy- friend , that 's right is n't it ?
WILLIAM: Maybe .
SPIKE: And she 's in your house .
WILLIAM: Yes .
SPIKE: And you get on very well .
WILLIAM: Yes .
SPIKE: Well , is n't this perhaps a good opportunity to slip her one ?
WILLIAM: Spike . For God 's sake she 's in trouble get a grip .
SPIKE: Right . Right . You think it 's the wrong moment . Fair enough . Do you mind if I have a go ?
WILLIAM: Spike !
SPIKE: No you 're right .
WILLIAM: I 'll talk to you in the morning .
SPIKE: Okay okay . Might be too late , but okay .

ANNA: What ? And then gets over it straight away .
WILLIAM: Nothing . And kisses her .
ANNA: You and every person in this country .
WILLIAM: Oh God yes I 'm sorry .
ANNA: What is it about men and nudity ? Particularly breasts how can you be so interested in them ?
WILLIAM: Well
ANNA: No seriously . I mean , they 're just easts . Every second person in the world has got them
WILLIAM: More than that actually , when you think about it . You know , Meatloaf has a very nice pair
ANNA: But they 're odd-looking . They 're for milk . Your mum 's got them . You must have seen a thousand of them what 's the fuss about ?
WILLIAM: Actually , I ca n't think really let me just have a quick look He looks under the sheet at her breasts .
ANNA: Rita Hayworth used to say 'they go to ed with Gilda they wake up with me . ' Do you feel that ?
WILLIAM: Who was Gilda ?
ANNA: Her most famous part men went to bed with the dream and they did n't like it when they woke up with the reality do you feel that way with me ?
WILLIAM: You 're lovelier this morning than you have ever been .
ANNA: Oh .
WILLIAM: Stay forever .
ANNA: Damn , I forgot the jam . The doorbell goes .
WILLIAM: Jesus Christ .
ANNA: What ?
WILLIAM: Do n't ask .
ANNA: You 're up to something
WILLIAM: Undressed like this , yes .
ANNA: Jesus .
SPIKE: Morning , daring ones .
ANNA: It 's Anna . The press are here . No , there are hundreds of them . My illiant plan was not so brilliant after all . Yeh , I know , I know . Just get me out then . Damnit . She heads upstairs .
WILLIAM: I would n't go outside .
SPIKE: Why not ?
WILLIAM: Just take my work for it .
SPIKE: How did I look ? Inspects himself .
WILLIAM: How are you doing ?
ANNA: How do you think I 'm doing ?
WILLIAM: I do n't know what happened .
ANNA: I do . Your furry friend thought he 'd make a buck or two telling the papers where I was . She 's packing .
WILLIAM: That 's not true .
ANNA: Really ? The entire British press just woke up this morning and thought 'Hey I know where Anna Scott is . She 's in that house with the blue door in Notting Hill . ' And then you go out in you goddamn underwear .
SPIKE: I went out in my goddamn underwear too .
WILLIAM: Get out , Spike . I 'm so sorry .
ANNA: This is such a mess . I come to you to protect myself against more crappy gossip and now I 'm landed in it all over again . For God 's sake , I 've got a boyfriend .
WILLIAM: You do ?
ANNA: As far as they 're concerned I do . And now tomorrow there 'll be pictures of you in every newspapers from here to Timbuktu .
WILLIAM: I know , I know but just let 's stay calm
ANNA: You can stay calm it 's the perfect situation for you minimum input , maximum publicity . Everyone you eve ump into will know . 'Well done you you slept with that actress we 've seen the pictures . '
WILLIAM: That 's spectacularly unfair .
ANNA: Who knows , it may even help business . Buy a boring book about Egypt from the guy who screwed Anna Scott . She heads out .
WILLIAM: Now stop . Stop . I beg you calm down . Have a cup of tea .
ANNA: I do n't want a goddamn cup of tea . I want to go home . The doorbell goes .
WILLIAM: Spike , check who that is and fo God 's sake put some clothes on . Spike leans merrily out of the window .
SPIKE: Looks like a chauffeur to me .
ANNA: And remember Spike owes you an expensive dinner . Or holiday depending if he 's got the brains to get the going rate on betrayal .
WILLIAM: That 's not true . And wait a minute this is crazy behavior . Ca n't we just laugh about this ? Seriously in the huge sweep of things , this stuff does n't matter .
SPIKE: What he 's going to say next is there are people starving in the Sudan .
WILLIAM: Well , there are . And we do n't need to go anywhere near that far . My best friend slipped she slipped down- stairs , cracked her back and she 's in a wheelchair for the rest of her life . All I 'm asking for is a normal amount of perspective .
ANNA: You 're right of course , you 're right . It 's just that I 've dealt with this garbage for ten years now you 've had it for ten minutes . Our perspectives are different .
WILLIAM: I mean today 's newspapers will be lining tomorrow 's waste paper bins .
ANNA: Excuse me ?
WILLIAM: Well , you know it 's just one day . Today 's papers will all have been thrown away tomorrow .
ANNA: You really do n't get it . This story gets filed . Every time anyone writes anything about me they 'll dig up these photos . Newspapers last forever . I 'll regret this forever . He takes this in . That 's the end .
WILLIAM: Right . Fine . I will do the opposite , if it 's all right by you and always be glad you came . But you 're right you probably better go .
SPIKE: I suppose I might have told one or two people down the pub .
WILLIAM: Right .
HONEY: Have we got something for you . Something which will make you love me so much you 'll want to hug me every single day for the rest of my life .
WILLIAM: Blimey . What 's that ?
HONEY: The phone number of Anna Scott 's agent in London and her agent in New York . You can ring her . You think about he all the time now you can ring her !
WILLIAM: Well , thanks , that 's great .
HONEY: It is great , is n't it . See you tonight . Hey , Marty sexy cardy .
BELLA: I have a little speech to make I wo n't stand up because I ca n't be bothered . Exactly a year ago today , this man here started the finest restaurant in London .
TONY: Thank you very much .
BELLA: Unfortunately no one ever came to eat here .
TONY: A tiny hiccough .
BELLA: And so we must face the fact that from next week , we have to find somewhere near to eat . Tony 's brave face breaks . The dream is over .
BERNIE: get fired .
BELLA: No !
BERNIE: Yes , they 're shifting the whole outfit much more towards the trading side and of course I was total crap . They 're all rather stunned .
TONY: So we go down together ! A toast to Bernie the worst stockbroker in the whole world ! They toast him .
HONEY: Since it 's an evening of announcements I 've also got one , Ahm I 've decided to get engaged . Total bewilderment from the others .
WILLIAM: Wait a minute I 'm your brother and I do n't know anything about this .
MAX: Is it someone we know ?
HONEY: Yes . I will keep you informed .
SPIKE: Me ?
HONEY: Yes . What do you think ?
SPIKE: Well , yes . Groovy .
MAX: Any more announcements ?
WILLIAM: Yes I feel I must apologize to everyone for my behavior for the last six months . I have , as you know , been slightly down in the mouth .
MAX: There 's an understatement . There are dead people on better form .
WILLIAM: But I wish to make it clear I 've turned a corner and henceforward intend to be impressively happy .
BELLA: I 'm really horribly drunk .
MAX: So you 've laid the ghost .
WILLIAM: I believe I have .
MAX: Do n't give a damn about the famous girl .
WILLIAM: No , do n't think I do .
MAX: Which means you wo n't be distracted by the fact that she 's back in London , grasping her Oscar , and to be found filming most days on Hampstead Heath .
WILLIAM: Oh God no .
MAX: So not over her , in fact .
SECURITY: Can I help you ?
WILLIAM: Yes I was looking for Anna Scott
SECURITY: Does she know you 're coming ?
WILLIAM: No , no . She does n't .
SECURITY: I 'm afraid I ca n't really let you through then , sir .
WILLIAM: Oh right . I mean , I am a friend I 'm not a lunatic but no , you basically
SECURITY: ca n't let you through .
ANNA: This is certainly ah
WILLIAM: I only found out you were here yesterday .
ANNA: I was going to ring but I did n't think you 'd want to The third assistant is under pressure .
THIRD: Anna .
ANNA: It 's not going very well and it 's our last day .
WILLIAM: Absolutely you 're clearly very busy .
ANNA: But wait there are things to say .
WILLIAM: Okay .
ANNA: Drink tea there 's lots of tea .
KAREN: Come and have a look
WILLIAM: This is Henry James film ?
KAREN: This is Harry he 'll give you a pair of headphones so you can hear the dialogue .
HARRY: Here we go . The volume control is on the side .
WILLIAM: That 's great .
JAMES: We are living in cloudcuckooland we 'll never get this done today .
ANNA: We have to . I 've got to be in New York on Thursday .
JAMES: Oh , stop showing off .
ANNA: I 'm not listening .
JAMES: No , but seriously it 's not fair so many tragic young teenagers with anorexia and that girl has an arse she could perfectly well share round with at least ten other women and still be beg-bottomed .
ANNA: I said I 'm not listening and I think , looking at something that firm , you and your droopy little excuse for an 'arse ' would be well-advised to keep quiet .
JAMES: 'Tomorrow will be soon enough . '
ANNA: And then I right .
JAMES: Who was that rather difficult chap you were talking to on the way up ?
ANNA: Oh no one no one . Just some guy from the past . I do n't know what he 's doing here . Bit of an awkward situation .
WILLIAM: Of course .
HARRY: Anytime .
SPIKE: What 's going on ?
WILLIAM: I 'm going to throw out these old videos .
SPIKE: No . You ca n't bin these . They 're classics . I 'm not allowing this .
WILLIAM: Right let 's talk about rent
SPIKE: Let me help . We do n't want all this shit cluttering up our lives .
MARTIN: I have to disturb you when you 're cooking the books , but there 's a delivery .
WILLIAM: Martin , ca n't you just deal with this yourself ?
MARTIN: But it 's not for the shop . It 's for you .
WILLIAM: Okay . Tell me , would I have to pay a wet ag as much as I pay you ?
ANNA: Hi .
WILLIAM: Hello .
ANNA: You disappeared .
WILLIAM: Yes I 'm sorry I had to leave I did n't want to disturb you .
ANNA: Well how have you been ?
WILLIAM: Fine . Everything much the same . When they change the law Spike and I will marry immediately . Whereas you I 've watched in wonder . Awards , glory
ANNA: Oh no . It 's all nonsense , believe me . I had no idea how much nonsense it all was but nonsense it all is Well , yesterday was our last day filming and so I 'm just off but I ought you this from home , and
WILLIAM: Thank you . Shall I
ANNA: No , do n't open it yet I 'll be embarrassed .
WILLIAM: Okay well , thank you . I do n't know what it 's for . But thank you anyway .
ANNA: I actually had it in my apartment in New York and just thought you 'd but , when it came to it , I did n't know how to call you having behaved so badly , twice . So it 's been just sitting in the hotel . But then you came , so I figured the thing is the thing is
WILLIAM: What 's the thing ?
MR. SMITH: Right . Sorry . And he leaves .
WILLIAM: You were saying
ANNA: Yes . The thing is I have to go away today but I wondered , if I did n't , whether you might let me see you a bit or , a lot maybe see if you could like me again . Pause as William takes this in .
WILLIAM: But yesterday that actor asked you who I was and you just dismissed me out of hand I heard you had a microphone I had headphones .
ANNA: You expect me to tell the truth about my life to the most indiscreet man in England ? Martin edges up .
MARTIN: Excuse me it 's your mother on the phone .
WILLIAM: Can you tell her I 'll ring her back .
MARTIN: I actually tried that tack but she said you said that before and it 's been twenty-four hours , and her foot that was purple is now a sort of blackish color
WILLIAM: Okay perfect timing as ever hold the fort for a second will you , Martin ? Martin is left with Anna .
MARTIN: Can I just say , I thought 'Ghost ' was a wonderful film .
ANNA: Is that right ?
MARTIN: Yes I 've always wondered what Patrick Swayze is like in real life .
ANNA: I ca n't say I know Patrick all that well .
MARTIN: Oh dear . He was n't friendly during the filming ?
ANNA: Well , no I 'm sure he was friendly to Demi Moore who acted with him in 'Ghost . ' She 's kind in here , not sarcastic .
MARTIN: Oh right . Right . Sorry . Always been a bit of an ass . William returns a little uneasy .
WILLIAM: Sorry about that .
ANNA: That 's fine . There 's always a pause when the jury goes out to consider its verdict . She 's awaiting an answer .
WILLIAM: Anna . Look I 'm a fairly level- headed bloke . Not often in and out of love . But He ca n't really express what he feels .
ANNA: Yes , that 's fine . Of course . I you know of course I 'll just e getting along then nice to see you .
WILLIAM: The truth is He feels he must explain .
ANNA: I see . That reality is a real 'no , ' is n't it ?
WILLIAM: I live in Notting Hill . You live in Beverly Hills . Everyone in the world knows who you are . My mother has trouble remembering my name .
ANNA: Okay . Fine . Fine . Good decision . Pause .

BELLA: Where are you going ?
MAX: Down Kensington Church Street , then Knightsbridge , then Hyde Park Corner .

QUESTIONER 2: Do you believe the rumours ?

QUESTIONER 3: Last time you were here , there were some fairly graphic photographs of you and a young English guy so what happened there ?
ANNA: He was just a friend I think we 're still friends .
JEREMY: Yes , the gentleman in the pink shirt .
WILLIAM: Yes Miss Scott are there any circumstances in which you two might be more than just friends ? Anna sees who it is asking .
ANNA: I hoped there might be but no , I 'm assured there are n't .
WILLIAM: And what would you say
JEREMY: No , it 's just one question per person .
ANNA: No , let him ask away . You were saying ?
WILLIAM: Yes , I just wondered whether if it turned out that this person
OTHER JOURNALIST: His name is Thacker .

ANNA: Yes , I 'm pretty sure I would .
WILLIAM: That 's very good news . The readers of 'Horse and Hound ' will be absolutely delighted . Anna whispers something to Jeremy .

WESLEY: Is n't that the point ?
DEL: Yeah , well , I do n't have time to screw around . I got buyers in Dallas , Houston and Vegas who are ready to snap this stuff up .
CHARLIE: We appreciate that . But you just poured me a drink , I 'd like to enjoy you hospitality for a few minutes .

DEL: All right lem me see okay , new Burger King opens up . These assholes get excited and start lining up . Like it 's some five star restaurant . The place is mobbed . Right ?
CHARLIE: Hmmmm . `` Five Stars , '' huh ?
BEAT: Is that stupid , Wesley ?

DEL: The Indians , Injuns , whatever . They 're always drunk and doing stupid things .
CHARLIE: Like what ?
DEL: Driving their cars into trees puking on the sidewalk stupid shit !
CHARLIE: Let 's see around here that would be Kiowa , Kickapoo or Osage , if I 'm not mistaken .
DEL: I I do n't know
CHARLIE: Well , my idea of stupid is very different from yours .
BEAT: So here 's how this is gon na work . Would you take your socks off , please ?

DAVID: You 're wonderful , Chloe , you are But I just know there 's something special out there for me .
CHARLIE: Now I 'm gon na tell you what stupid is . Stupid is taking something that does n't elong to you . Right Wesley ?
WESLEY: That 's right .
CHARLIE: Stupid is trying to sell it to othe people who are , by their very nature , untrustworthy .
WESLEY: That is so right .
CHARLIE: Stupid is calling people in Kansas City who are affiliated with the rightful owners of the thing you stole , and trying to sell it to them . Right Wesley ?
WESLEY: Now , that 's really stupid .
CHARLIE: So you see , we have totally different ideas of what 's stupid and what 's not . Do n't we ? Del nods ; crying , sweating . CHARLIE Good . Now we 're getting somewhere . You agree that you were stupid ?
WESLEY: Hell of a way to die .
CHARLIE: It was n't always fatal , Wesley . We could scalp Del right now , and he 'd be plenty alive to tell us how it feels . Del 's eyes get huge .
WESLEY: A mark , huh ?
CHARLIE: Now . I want to know the particulars of your stupid act how you got what does n't belong to you , who helped you get it , and of course , where it is now .
DEL: It 's in the Buick ! I swear to God it 's all there !
DAVID: You wanted to see me , Blake ?
BLAKE: I wish I could say I had good news . David , I 'll get right to the point . Chloe Jensen has filed charges of sexual
BEAT: You can continue to practice at L.A. County , but I 'm afraid I have to revoke your privileges here at Loma Vista until this is resolved .
DEL: I got it from a truck driver named Duane Cooley , out of Amarillo . He brings my cars down from Detroit . But I have n't touched it , I swear to you Please ! Please ! Please !
CHARLIE: Consider yourself lucky . Luckier than those 'Injuns ' you have such contempt for .
WESLEY: IT SURE IS ! !
CHARLIE: JESUS CHRIST ! ! !
WESLEY: You told me how to do it !
CHARLIE: That was to get him to talk !
BEAT: Get rid of that thing , will you ?
WESLEY: He told us it 's in the Buick .
CHARLIE: We do n't know which Buick , do we ?

BETTY: Make sure it 's elevated
ROY: Uh-huh .
BETTY: You want me to make you a sling ? It 's no problem
ROY: Well , I was worried about you and I wanted to make sure you were alright and I guess I was sort of hoping I could ask you about what happened
BETTY: Oh , that Sure , I saw the whole thing . It was disgusting !
ROY: My God did you get a look at who did it ?
BETTY: Yes .
ROY: You did ? Was it anyone that you ?
BETTY: It was Chloe
BALLARD: Hey , you guys wan na try not stepping directly in the evidence , please ? Ostrey , you and your goddamn police scanner ! I leave for ten minutes and Betty , I 'm sorry about this . He motions to a female officer .
BETTY: 'Night , guys
BALLARD: Okay , let 's go I got nothing for the ecord yet .
ROY: Oww ! My arm , careful !
BALLARD: Ahh , what 'd you do now fall off you ike again ?
ROY: No , it 's nothing , I my piranha just mauled me a little when I layed thei food out .
BALLARD: Good Godthey 're meat eaters , Roy , just drop the shit in there !
ROY: I can'tthey prefer a more formal presentation . I do n't usually go so close to the surface , but I was
BALLARD: you are so goddamn weird .
BEAT: Oh , and by the way , get the hell outta here !
ROY: No , Elden , I need to
BALLARD: You need to get yourself gone from my crime scene . And leave Betty alone , she 's
ROY: She knows who killed Del . Elden , she said it was a woman .
BALLARD: It was n't a woman .
ROY: Yes it was . Betty saw the whole thing ! Your killer 's name is Chloe
BALLARD: I 'm tellin ' you it was n't no woman , Roy !
ROY: Jesus
BALLARD: You think a woman did that ? !
BEAT: Del must 've sold a lemon to the wrong Indian , and got paid back the old fashioned way . Them Kickapoos get pretty mean when they drink
ROY: So , you think you 're gon na find his scalp hanging in some tepee ?
BALLARD: They no longer live in tepees , Mr. College Graduate .
ROY: Did you send anyone out there ?
BALLARD: You bet I did . I got a squad car on the way to the reservation right now .
ROY: Bad idea
BALLARD: You just go write your little story , Roy . I 'll handle the police work
ROY: You better handle what 's in this garbage can first .
WESLEY: I still do n't understand how you knew Del was telling the truth .
CHARLIE: I saw his soul Wesley . He was face to face with his God , and no one lies in that situation . But your Geronimo act attled me , and I abandoned my instincts .
BEAT: Never abandon you instincts .
WESLEY: I did n't . You gave me a look !
CHARLIE: What 'look ' ?
WESLEY: That one look you got ! I thought you were done , so I took him out
CHARLIE: I was n't done , I was just sick of hearing him whine . And you did n't take him out , you scalped him . Christ , I almost puked , did I tell you that ?
WESLEY: Well , why 'd you have to tell that Indian story ?
CHARLIE: What the hell does that mean ? If I 'd told a Ty Cobb story would you have clubbed him to death with a bat ?
WESLEY: You just gon na leave these cars sitting here like this ?
CHARLIE: Why not , it 'll confuse 'em got ta do something , now that you fucked it up .
WESLEY: I wanted to make a statement .
CHARLIE: Let me tell you something . In ou usiness you ca n't put food on the table if your phone does n't ring . The guys who get the calls are good - not flashy , just good . They get in , they get out . Nobody knows a goddamn thing . Understand ? Boom , boom , boom . Three in the head and you know they 're dead .
WESLEY: that 's a good motto .
CHARLIE: Fine , I 'll get you a bumpersticker , but you better start believing it ! It 's the only statement you need to make .
DOCTOR: And did your husband know these people ?
BETTY: Sort ofbut he ignored them .
DOCTOR: And how did that make you feel , Betty ?
BETTY: I felt all cold inside . And angry .
BALLARD: I questioned Joyce about all this
ROY: Yeah ?
BALLARD: Seems she was pretty familiar with 'ol Del . On a regular basis , if you get my drift
ROY: and half the other guys in this town . Including you , I believe
BALLARD: Junior year !
ROY: Anyway , so what ?
BALLARD: So ? Suppose Betty found out about them ?
ROY: You said a woman could n't have done it .
BALLARD: A woman can write a check .
ROY: So you 're saying Betty Sizemore - ou Betty Sizemorewho you were in swing choir withhas now hired somebody to scalp her husband in her own kitchen while she watched ? You 're amazing .
BALLARD: 'S just a theoryjust 'cause I 'm thinking it do n't mean I like it . The doctor comes out of the holding room . BALLARD How is she ?
DOCTOR: She 's in a kind of shock . I see all the signs of a post-traumatic reaction with possible dissociative symptoms .
BALLARD: Could I have that in American ?
DOCTOR: It 's a type of altered stateit allows a traumatized person to continue functioning .
BALLARD: So she did witness it ?
ROY: Oh , you 're sharp as a tack , Elden .
BALLARD: That 's it ! YOU 'RE GONE !
ROY: Oww , the arm , the arm !
BALLARD: You just do n't know when to quit , Roy ! You were jealous of me when I got hall monitor in seventh grade , and you 're still jealous now ! ! !
ROY: One question , Doctor , please ! You ca n't do this ! I 'm the press , I have rights ! !
BALLARD: That 's right , you have the right to emain silent .
DOCTOR: I was saying that it seems probable that she witnessed the murder , but her memory of it is gone , at least for the time eing . I also think you ought to have he
BEAT: Any idea who Chloe or Lonnie are ?
BALLARD: No Friends from the diner maybe ?
DOCTOR: Well , you should find out . She keeps talking about them
SUE ANN: Let me know if you need anything , okay ?
BETTY: Are you and Larry happy ?
SUE ANN: Oh , I dunno enough , I s'pose .
BETTY: Then you should treasure that you got ta hold on to whatever you got that 's any good , even if it 's only a little bit .
SUE ANN: All you been through I ever tell you what a good friend you are ?
BETTY: All the time
SUE ANN: Well , you are . After a beat
BETTY: Something bad happened to Del and me , did n't it ?
SUE ANN: Yeah , hon . Real bad . You just get some sleep , everything 's gon na be fine .
BETTY: Sue Ann , I 'm sorry about all this , but I just know there 's something special out there for me
WESLEY: So you got Asian women ?
DUANE: Sure , I got Asian . Got black , white , any color you like , video and magazine . Got fat chicks and animals too , if you want 'em . They 're extra
CHARLIE: Mmmm . Well , it was a piece of luck unning into you , Duane . I thought I was
WESLEY: I like 'em small . When you 're inside a little Asian chick , it 's like your dick is the axle that holds her body together .
DUANE: That 's nicely put . You outta get yourself to Thailand
CHARLIE: What part of Dixie are you from , Duane ?
DUANE: Georgia . In case I did n't tell you , it 's cash only , gentlemen .
WESLEY: We can live with that .
CHARLIE: I 'm a Yankee , myself . Massachusetts . Duane passes two videos to Wesley .
DUANE: Here 's Ghengis Kunt and The Demilitarized Zone . Get it ? They 're Korean , so they 're pretty hot .
CHARLIE: You know , it 's interesting . The South lost the Civil War , but they still seem to get all the glory .
DUANE: Huh ?
CHARLIE: Jeb Stuart , Stonewall Jackson , Jefferson Davis - they 're all losers in my book .
DUANE: The fuck you talking about ?
CHARLIE: Even Robert E. Lee was a loser .
DUANE: He goin ' crazy on us , or what ?
CHARLIE: Did you know the most brutal , inhumane prison of the entire war was in Georgia ?
DUANE: Really . And where was that , old man ?
CHARLIE: Andersonville .
BEAT: They did horrible things to men there
LONNIE: I think you better tell me what 's going on here , Chloe .
CHLOE: I just feel funny about what we did .
LONNIE: You feel guilty ? Let me remind you of something , sweetheart . You 're in this up to those fabulous eyes of yours . Understand ?
CHARLIE: So , at a rest stop outside Logansport you noticed that two guys were slipping something extra in one of your cars , and you decided to see what it was . Then you figured you 'd take this valuable commodity and go into business yourself , even though it did n't belong to you . But you needed a crackerjack salesman to move it , so you made the biggest mistake of your short life and chose Del . Sound ight so far ? Duane nods . CHARLIE Del 's dead , by the way . I sent him to the Great Beyond .
WESLEY: Actually , I scalped him , and then you killed him . Duane narrows his eyes in disbelief .
CHARLIE: Exactly .
BEAT: Now , the one thing I do n't get is that we checked all the Buicks on that lot . Fou '97 LeSabres and nothing in 'em . Duane smiles mockingly .
WESLEY: Should I kill him now ?
CHARLIE: Wait . Any last words , General Lee ?
DUANE: Suck my dick , you Yankee piece of shit .
CHARLIE: God , I admire that . Ya see that , Wesley ? That 's why they get all the glory .
WESLEY: why 'd you spit on me ?
CHARLIE: Come on , Wesley , three shots .
WESLEY: Well , no one ever spit in my face before . Especially some cracker fuck .
CHARLIE: You have to rise above it . The professionals rise above that kind of thing
NEWSCASTER: small town of Fair Oaks has left people shaken owner-manager of Sizemore Motors
DEPUTY: Sheriff , it 's Betty Sizemore , on two !
BALLARD: SHHH ! BETTY ? WHERE ARE
BETTY: I 'm in a motel . Has something happened to Del ? Did he do something stupid ?
REPORTER #1: Who witnessed Ms. Sizemore driving here ?
BALLARD: The Assistant Manager , Mr. Wylie .
REPORTER #2: But he could n't identify the male passenger ?
BALLARD: Only to say he was wearing green .
ROY: What if the killers did n't see her ? You published her picture - you 're gon na get her killed !
BALLARD: No , we 're bringing the community into the effort to find her .
ROY: You 're lying !
BALLARD: I spoke to Betty Sizemore yesterday . That 's right . There 's no doubt in my mind , folks she 's on the run . Whethe or not she 's mixed up in all this remains to be seen
ROY: That 's bullshit , Sheriff ! You think she 's a suspect !
BALLARD: I 'd like to apologize for our local boy . He 's been in love with Betty since the fifth grade , y'see . He means well , but he 's in over his head on this .
WESLEY: So how do we know that car 's still in Fair Oaks ?
CHARLIE: We do n't . But a '97 Le Sabre 'll be easy to find if it 's here , town this size
BEAT: He said he gave his wife some car as a gift , remember ?
WESLEY: I can eat because I know we did n't kidnap that woman . I can eat because they are n't looking for us . And I can eat 'cause I 'm fucking hungry relax . She 's gon na end up on a milk carton and that 's about it .
CHARLIE: I hope you 're right
WESLEY: I know I am . Let 's just do what we got ta do here , and get the fuck gone .
CHARLIE: She got out of town awfully fast . And was n't she quiet in that house ? I think most women would have screamed , do n't you ? I know they would 've
WESLEY: Mrs. Rogers ? I 'm Dwight Campbell , with Neighborly Life Insurance . I 'm looking for Betty Sizemore .
SUE ANN: I wish I could help you , but I ca n't .
WESLEY: Are n't they precious ?
BEAT: Ma'am , she has a substantial death enefit coming to her from the tragic loss of her husband . Does she have any elatives in the area ?
SUE ANN: No .
BEAT: Well , her grandparents are down in Oklahoma , but that 's it
WESLEY: I see . And are you in touch with Mrs. Sizemore ?
SUE ANN: No . But I 'm taping her show every day so she can watch it when she comes back .
WESLEY: Her show ?
SUE ANN: `` A Reason to Love . ''
WESLEY: I see .
BEAT: Did Chloe testify ?
SUE ANN: I do n't think she will . She 's a slut , but I just do n't think she 's that mean . Jasmine 'll bring her around
WESLEY: Jasmine Do you have yesterday 's show on tape , by any chance ?
CHARLIE: and how long did she work here ?
DARLENE: Oh , five years , give or take .
CHARLIE: Hmm you two in high school together ?
DARLENE: Are n't you a sweetheart no , not quite . Anyway , she 's been with us awhile .
CHARLIE: But she wanted more out of life , right ?
DARLENE: No she just wanted something outta life . Anything . And with Del , she was n't getting nothing . That 's he husband , Del . I 'm sorry about what happened and all , but that 's the way I feel about all of this
CHARLIE: I see . May I ?
DARLENE: If it helps bring her back , be my guest
CHARLIE: Thank you for your cooperation .
BEAT: Just one more thing did she ever talk about getting rich ?
DARLENE: who does n't ?
WESLEY: and what kind of car does she drive ?
JOYCE: Well , she wanted a LeSabre , but Del made her use that blue Corsica
BEAT: So , is this what you boys 'd call 'pumping me for information ? ' Joyce GIGGLES as Wesley stops moving .
WESLEY: Did you say LeSabre ?
JOYCE: Look , she did n't kill Del over no car if that 's what you 're thinking .
WESLEY: But she could have taken one , right ?
JOYCE: Maybe , but I do n't think she had the nerve . I know her . And I 'm a pretty good judge of character
WESLEY: yeah , I can see that .
BETTY: Would you mind very much if I changed the channel at three o'clock ?
MERLE: Yes .
BETTY: Please ? It 's very important to me . `` A Reason to Love '' comes on at three around here .
MERLE: ARE YOU DEAF ? ! !
BETTY: That 's real funny . Why do n't you have another drink ?
ELLEN: What 's the matter here ?
BETTY: I begged him to let me put that on !
ELLEN: He 's a prick . Merle ? You 're a prick .
BETTY: Hi , I 'm Betty . I 'll take a Miller , if you got it
CHLOE: Lonnie ? It 's Chloe . We need to talk I do n't think I can go through with this .
BETTY: Do you have a phone ? Ellen swings a phone up onto the bar .
ELLEN: If it 's long distance you can leave me a uck when you 're done . Betty dials
BETTY: Sue Ann ? It 's Betty . I just wanted to let you know I 'm okay Huh ? I 'm at the Canyon Ranch Bar in
MERLE: Phoenix
ELLEN: Shut up , Merle Williams .
BETTY: Williams , Arizona . About halfway there , I guess .
SUE ANN: Halfway where ? You 've got ta come home . We 've been worried sick about you . Are you alright ?
BEAT: Del 's life insurance policy Are you with me ?
BETTY: Tell Del I 'm sorry . I left so quick , but I need to do this .
LONNIE: How you holding up , amigo ?
DAVID: I just wish I knew why she 's doing it .
LONNIE: Yeah . Women are an unsolved mystery .
ELLEN: Where you headed , Betty ?
BETTY: Los Angeles , California .
ELLEN: And you called your friend , and she 's telling you not to go ? When I went to Europe my friends told me I was crazy .
BETTY: Europe ? The Europe ? This is my first time out of Kansas .
ELLEN: I should call you Dorothy .
BEAT: When I left here I went straight to Italy . Everybody told me not to go . But I wanted to go to Rome ever since I saw Audrey Hepburn in `` Roman Holiday , '' and goddamnit , I went .
BETTY: Did you love it ?
ELLEN: Sure I loved it ! It was great .
BETTY: That 's horrible !
ELLEN: No , he was a toad . Even more of a toad than Merle I just wear the ring to keep the flies away . Rome was the best thing I ever did , because I DID IT ! And I swear to you , it changed me . I 've been to Rome , Italy ! I sat every morning at the Cafe Sistina and had my cappuccino , and watched the pilgrims walk to mass , and no one can ever take that away from me .
BETTY: I left my husband two days ago .
ELLEN: Really ?
BETTY: I 'm getting back with my ex-fianc . He proposed to me right around here , so I guess this is just sort of a sentimental stop
ELLEN: Wait , I thought you said you 'd never been outta Kansas
BETTY: Oh . I mean , except for that .
BEAT: Yep . I 'm trading in a car dealer for a heart specialist , so that 's pretty good
ELLEN: Nice move . Cedars Sinai ?
BETTY: No . Loma Vista .
ELLEN: I s'pose his name 's David Ravell .
BETTY: How did you know ?
ELLEN: What 's his real name ?
BETTY: Dr. David Ravell .
ELLEN: You mean George McCord , the actor ?
BETTY: No , I mean David Ravell . He 's a surgeon . Ellen looks at Betty .
ELLEN: Yeah , I know , we just watched him together , remember ? Up there on the TV . Good God Almighty You 're serious . I 've heard about people like you .
BETTY: I 'll go to the Hospital .
ELLEN: What if you ca n't find him ? What if you get out there , and nothing 's the way you thought it was gon na be ?
BETTY: Like Rome ?
ELLEN: Worse .
BETTY: You made out alright .
ELLEN: Yeah , but at least I knew Rome was gon na e there when I arrived
BETTY: Ellen , this is the biggest thing I 've ever done , but I 've got ta do it .
ELLEN: You take care of yourself then , Betty , and do n't let anybody stop you
BETTY: To tell you the truth , I ca n't believe I 've made it this far . It may not be Europe , but I just know there 's something special out there for me
MERLE: What planet is she from ?
CHARLIE: So she gets rid of the asshole and is set for life in the same day .
WESLEY: You think so ? Joyce says she 's timid .
CHARLIE: Joyce was screwing Del .
WESLEY: among others .
CHARLIE: I 'd say that about torches he credibility , would n't you ?
WESLEY: Yeah , well , if the wife 's trying to sell it she 'll fuck up . She 's an amateur , just like Del was . The CAR PHONE RINGS . Charlie answers .
CHARLIE: Maybe Yes ?
WESLEY: A 'Finn ? ' What is a Finn ?
CHARLIE: You should read more . Listen to me . I think this woman was waiting for a chance to do this , and we gave it to her . She kept to herself for years , living with a pompous asshole . Then she sees he opportunity , and BOOM ! - she leaves that little mudpatch in the dust . These heartlanders ca n't figure it out , 'cause that 's not their sweet little Betty . Hah ! We 've been tracking her for , what , three days and I already understand he etter ' n most the people in that shitty little burg .
WESLEY: So what the fuck 's a Finn ?
CHARLIE: Oh , for Chrissakes . It just means the kind of person who can eat shit for a long time without complaining , then cut their momma 's throat and go dancing the same night .
WESLEY: Like us ?
CHARLIE: No , like a worthy adversary , Wesley . Like a very worthy adversary .
BALLARD: What the hell do you want ? Hey , Sue Ann , what 's up ?

ELIZABETH: This is Betty at twelve .
CHARLIE: Very graceful . Perfect form .
ELIZABETH: Betty was a lovely child .
JERROLD: And she always had such spirit ! But , after her mother died
WESLEY: Would you say she was ambitious ?
JERROLD: Oh , there 's no tellin ' what that girl could 've accomplished , and she never had it easy . Never really had a childhood caring for her father , going to school .
CHARLIE: Wise beyond her years , I 'm sure , and such poise , too . Very , very impressive
WESLEY: Well , then , did you ever get any indication that she wanted to leave he husband ?
ELIZABETH: I do n't like talking bad about the dead , ut now that he 's gone I can tell you she put up with things in that marriage I would n't have . And yes , she , of all people , was the one who defended him . And that 's why what that sheriff said makes me so angry .
CHARLIE: What do you mean ?
ELIZABETH: If anyone had paid to have that husband of hers killed , it would have been me .
CHARLIE: Mrs. Blaine ? I can tell you right now , without a doubt , that your granddaughte is alive , and did not kill Del Sizemore .
JERROLD: You 've got to be missing a piece of you soul to kill someone . That 's not ou Betty
WESLEY: why do you think you have to be missing a piece of your soul to kill somebody ?
JERROLD: Because it ai n't natural , young man .
WESLEY: What are you talking about ? Killing 's totally natural . It 's dying that is n't natural
CHARLIE: My partner 's still young , Mr. Blaine , and he loves his job . He 'd like to kill all the criminals himself !
BEAT: Now , if Betty was running from someone , where do you think she 'd go ?
BETTY: God I still look like a waitress .

BALLARD: You watch your mouth when you 're in a goddamn county vehicle You do n't think I see what 's going on ? Del , now this Cooley fella , both of 'em mixed up with Joyce 'S not no conspiracy , not some episode off the X-Files 's just a crime of passion , plain and simple .

ROY: Oww Did you have to make these things so tight ?
BALLARD: No , I did n't have to . He grins at Roy in the rearview mirror .
MERCEDES: Hey Is Betty still trying to find that soap opera guy ?

CHARLIE: What difference does it make ? She was n't in Kansas City , or Houston , or Dallas . We

CHARLIE: `` When I grow up I 'm going to become a nurse or a veterinarian . I always want to help people and value all life , be it animal , plant or mineral '' Does that sound like a goddamn showgirl to you ?
WESLEY: Do you hear yourself right now ? Like a fucking madman
CHARLIE: Every American should see the Grand Canyon . Are you an American ?
WESLEY: Yes , I am and we 're not going . Act professional .

GEORGE: I take it I should . I 'm sorry .
BETTY: We were engaged .
LYLA: Oh good , another one
GEORGE: I beg your pardon ?
BETTY: But I 'm the one who 's sorry . Letting you go was the biggest mistake of my life . We were thirteen days away from getting married and I just got scared . It 's a mistake I 've had to live with for six years . But it 's behind me now And I hope you can put it behind you . I 've missed you David .
GEORGE: That 's very kind of you .
BETTY: The day I left you I just drove and drove . I drove all day and all that night , and I did n't go anywhere . I just kept driving . I stopped at a little country church , and the pastor let me in , and I sat
LYLA: in the very first pew , where we would have sat on our wedding day .
BETTY: Betty Sizemore . What do you mean you wrote it ?
LYLA: I 'm Lyla Branch . I 'm the Producer .
GEORGE: No , waitwhat happened next , Betty ?
LYLA: Are you sure you want to encourage this ?

BETTY: Well , David moved out here and started his residency . Then he met Leslie
LYLA: No , no , no . We know all that . What happened with you ?

BETTY: Why are you calling him George ?
FRIEND #2: Yeah - David - tell us about this ca salesman .
GEORGE: Oh , you mean Fred .
BETTY: No , Del .
GEORGE: Right , Del . Del was one hot salesman . Of cars . He could talk anyone into anything .
BETTY: You knew Del ? !
GEORGE: Honey , I did n't want to tell you at the time , but Del and I go way back . We went to school together . In fact , he saved my life . Two more minutes in that icy wate and I would have drowned . But Del jumped in and grabbed me . We fell out of touch eventually , but I still owe him one .
BETTY: He never told me anything aboutthat 's unbelievable !
LYLA: Funny , that 's just what I was thinking
GEORGE: I ca n't tell you how much it hurts me to hear that you married him .
BETTY: I 'm so sorry . Life makes us do awful things sometimes .
GEORGE: I tried to tell myself it was for the est , that there was a reason behind it . But Del ?
BETTY: There was no plan ! I was just young and stupid and scared !
GEORGE: You never gave us a chance
BETTY: I know that . I ca n't tell you how many times I 've said that to myself in those exact words .
GEORGE: Hey , do n't come on , I was just you 're not really crying , are you ? I was just playing along
FRIEND #1: Now , look what you 've done , George .
BETTY: Why do they keep calling you George ?
GEORGE: I do n't know . Why do you keep calling me George ?
LYLA: Listen - David - It 's getting late . George hesitates ; Lyla sees it .
GEORGE: Right , uhhI feel terrible about this , we have a prior engagement at anothe party .
BEAT: But I 'd be honored if you 'd come .
LYLA: Yeah , bring your friend along . I 'm sure you got a lot of catching up to do
CHARLIE: You do n't know what you 're missing , asshole .
WESLEY: Yeah ?
WESLEY: you have a good time ? You make a little wish ?
CHARLIE: Where ? Where is she ?
WESLEY: I 'm not telling .
CHARLIE: What ?
WESLEY: I 'm not telling 'til you straighten up . You been acting like fucking Jerry Lewis on me and this shit 's got ta stop or you can forget about your Betty I mean it . A slow transformation comes over Charlie .
CHARLIE: Wesley , I 'm fine just tell me where she is .
FRIEND #2: I bought a car from Del , too . He sold me a lemon .
LYLA: Really ? I put a hundred and thirty thousand miles on mine .
BETTY: Huh . I had no idea our little lot was so popular
FRIEND #1: I never bought a car from Del . But I loved him . In my own way .
GEORGE: I guess we all did . You know , I did n't marry Leslie because I loved her . I married her to forget you
BETTY: Oh , DavidI 'm sorry I caused you that much pain .
GEORGE: You 're late , Eric .
ERIC: I know . Why are you guys leaving ?
LYLA: We did our twenty minutes .
BETTY: You bastard ! How can you even show you face around here ? Do you think we 're not onto you ?
ERIC: Who the hell is this ?
GEORGE: Sorry . She thinks you 're someone else .
BETTY: I know exactly who you are !
CHARLIE: This does n't look like the kind of place Betty would go to .
WESLEY: Maybe she had to use the bathroom . She pees , does n't she ? !
CHARLIE: Be careful with that !
ELLEN: What can I get you ?

BETTY: Lyla 's very nice .
GEORGE: Yes , she is .
BETTY: She told me I was charming and elentless , and would go far in this town . And she said that unlike the othe charming , relentless people she knew , she liked me .

We got our nails done and had lunch at `` Skies , '' a restaurant at the top of a building from where you can see the whole city . It was the last outing we took together .

CHARLIE: What does n't ?
WESLEY: You gim me this bullshit Psychic Friends theory , you believe that dumbshit trucker , you believe this woman
CHARLIE: I never said that I believed
WESLEY: No , you believed her , we drove all the way to L.A. so that means you trusted he that much so why 's the rest of he story suddenly so kooky ? Huh ?
CHARLIE: 'Cause I just do n't buy it . Call it instinct . Call it 35 years of professional know-how
WESLEY: I call it 'nutty ' as my shit after I eat Almond Roca
CHARLIE: You need to remember who you 're talking to

BETTY: Rosa , so you 've met David ?
ROSA: Sure did ! And a funny thing , Betty , he introduced himself to me as George !
BETTY: Oh , he does that . It 's this silly game he plays . Half the people who know him call him George .
GEORGE: I do n't think your friend likes me .
BETTY: She 's a little jealous , I think . And confused when it comes to men
BEAT: So where are we going ?
GEORGE: Well , first I thought Patina , and then the Ivy , but then I thought of somewhere a little more romantic . Like my place .
BETTY: You never mentioned a 'Stella ' to me .
GEORGE: Did n't I ?
BETTY: No , I would have remembered that name . The only Stella I ever knew was a parrot .
BEAT: Was this before Leslie ? Before us ?
GEORGE: I 've never met anyone like you , Betty .
BETTY: I know , that 's why we were meant to be together
GEORGE: No , I mean your dedication scares me
BETTY: It 's easy to be dedicated , when you care about something
GEORGE: Yeah , I felt that way , too , when I first started , but now the hours , the epetition it 's not all glamour and mall openings anymore . Maybe I should 've listened to my people and tried to make the crossover to nights earlier , I do n't know
BEAT: I just hope it 's not too late for me . God ! Listen to me , `` Me , me , me . '' It 's so easy to get caught up in the whole ego cycle of this business and make it all about yourself . Stop , right ? That 's it , no more about me tonight , I promise Let 's talk about youwhat do you think about me ? I 'm kidding Seriously , Betty , I 'm doing all the talking here

CHARLIE: Sure . You could probably have any thing you wanted somebody as beautiful and stylish as yourself , and you do n't even ealize it . Betty looks curiously over at Charlie . CHARLIE I 'm appreciably older than you , but my health is good . I take care of myself , and I got some money socked away . You 'd never have to work agin , that 's for sure . I 'd treat you like a queen .
BETTY: Umm , I do n't think that
CHARLIE: Wait . Let me get this out . I like the symphony , walks in the rain , sunsets , animals and children . I read passionately , and I like to discuss things . I 'm basically conservative , but flexible . I 've been involved in the death of thirty-two people , but I can live with that because the world is lighter by thirty-two pieces of shit , excuse my language .
BETTY: `` Thirty-two ? ''
CHARLIE: Well , thirty-three , but I 'm not counting Del , on account of you so , what do you think ?
BEAT: You probably feel I 'm flattering myself to see us together .
BETTY: I do n't feel that , no . I just.I 'm not eally who you think I am .
CHARLIE: No one is , honey . Here , listen to this `` If who I am and who I hope to e should meet one day , I know they will e friends . '' Now that 's beautiful . Betty is stunned .
BETTY: I wrote that when I was twelve where 'd you get that ? !
CHARLIE: I know . I borrowed it from you grandparents because I I it does n't matter . Do n't worry , they 're fine Look , I used to feel that same way , said practically those same words , sitting at night in a foxhole in Korea
BEAT: I 've chased you across the country , Betty , and I come to find out we 're a lot more alike than you 'd think .
BETTY: I thought you were a garbageman of humanity , or something .
CHARLIE: Yes , but I 'd sort of like to put that ehind me now
WESLEY: goddamn !
CHARLIE: Wesley ? ? !
ROY: Those 're Japanese koi !
ROSA: Yes ! How 'd you know that ?
ROY: You got ta get 'em in water right away !
BALLARD: We 're in a shootout , Roy ! Shut up about the damn fish !
ROY: YOU shut up ! They 're beautiful , but get them some water .
CHARLIE: Oh , Christ , they shot my boy !
BETTY: I 'm sorry .
CHARLIE: You 're sorry ? YOU 'RE THE REASON WE 'RE
CHARLIE: Oh shit
BALLARD: We need ammo Go check his jacket , I 'll cover you .
ROY: I 'm not going out there ! Let 's wait fo the real police
BALLARD: You got ta go , we 're pinned down !
ROSA: So why ca n't we just sneak outside ? Huh ?
BALLARD: Lady , you do n't just run away from crime besides , Betty 's in there .
ROY: You wan na see if he has more shells , go ahead . I say we wait
BALLARD: No , no , no you do n't know shit about procedure ! You do n't send your best
ROY: I 've got the working gun , Elden , me ! You wasted all your bullets so you crawl out there .
BALLARD: Goddammit
CHARLIE: If we went out that window right now we 'd have a chance
BETTY: I better go check on them .
CHARLIE: Wait , Betty you still have n't answered me .
BETTY: This is really awkward
CHARLIE: Ahh , it 's too late , anyway . It 's too late .
BEAT: Listen , I could shoot my way out , maybe take one of them with me If you 'd gim me my gun back .
BETTY: I 'd rather not
CHARLIE: Betty , I do n't wan na shrivel up alone in some stinking prison . No way . I 've got some professional pride . And I do n't want anybody else to get the credit fo taking me out .
BETTY: what 're you saying ?
CHARLIE: When a Roman general knew a battle was lost , he 'd throw himself on his sword .
BETTY: Yes Not the actor , though , the doctor . I think . Charlie 's sinks slowly to the floor .
CHARLIE: So all thisreally was because of that soap opera ? My son is dead because you came out here to be with that doctor ? A fake doctor ?
BETTY: I would n't have put it quite that way , ut
CHARLIE: Wesley did n't even want to come up here . He warned me , but I insisted
BEAT: I have to ask you , Bettyare you crazy ?
BETTY: I do n't think I am .
CHARLIE: I want you to listen to me , Betty . People do n't lie when they 're about to die .
BEAT: You do n't need that doctor . You do n't need that actor . You do n't need any man . It 's not the forties , honey . You do n't need anybody . You 've got yourself and that 's more than most people can say .
ANCHORMAN: In a story that police say is bizarre , even for Hollywood , a father-son team of killers tracked a Kansas soap opera fan halfway across the country , only to find themselves the victims in a final , bloody confrontation
LYLA: This story is beyond belief , which is perfect for us . It 's free advertising and it 's gon na run for months .
GEORGE: I do n't think she can do it . You saw what happened .
LYLA: You fucked it up . Who would n't freeze in those circumstances ? And I do n't care what her problems are . She would n't be the first one in that cast with problems . We have nothing to lose by making her an offer .
GEORGE: What about me ? Do n't you wan na know how I feel about it ? I 'm the one who
LYLA: Why would I give a shit how you feel . And I got news for you . I loved your 'icy water ' idea the other day I 'm toying
GEORGE: That 's not a bad idea . How many episodes efore he comes back ? Lyla shakes her head `` no . '' GEORGE Jesus , do n't do that ! If it gets around that you fired me , I 'll never land a pilot .
LYLA: Then do as you 're told . Get her back .
GEORGE: I 'm sorry for what I did . It was inexcusable . I 'm sorry for the things I said , and for not respecting you , and fo all the stupid things that
DARLENE: When you have a minute
GEORGE: Look , I do n't really like the whole idea of autographs , and I 'm kind of in the middle of
DARLENE: Do n't flatter yourself . It 's the check . She walks off .
GEORGE: Oh . Of course sorry .
BETTY: My treat . You were saying something about how stupid you 've been ?
GEORGE: Right I was . I was an idiot , plain and simple , and I hope you can find it in your heart to forgive me . How 's that ?
BETTY: Kinda like you 'd been saying it since you got on the plane
GEORGE: I have did it sound that bad ?
BETTY: Mmm-hmm . Listen , I forgive you , Mr. McCord
GEORGE: George
BETTY: George . I do .
BEAT: My best friend once said if you were any handsomer it would be a crime
GEORGE: Thanks
BETTY: it 's too bad you 're such an asshole . 'S the only thing that Del was ever right about . George winces accepts it .
GEORGE: No , that 's okay . Fair enough .
BEAT: So , now that we 've sort of settled the 'asshole ' thing , is there any chance you 'll come back to the show ? At all ?
BETTY: there 's always a chance , David .
DAVID: Right . But will there be a tomorrow , and the next day , and the next ?
BETTY: Doctor , if you were any handsomer it 'd be a crime
DAVID: I guess that means you 're free tonight . Of course , it 's up to you
BETTY: No , it 's up to us . I love you , David . And I want to see you tomorrow , and the next day , and the next day
SUE ANN: That 's my best friend !
BETTY: Could I get some service here , please ?
