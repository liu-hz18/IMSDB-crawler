OLD MAN: You seek a great fortune , you three who are now in chains The men fall silent .
DELMAR: How 'd he know about the treasure ?
EVERETT: Do n't know , Delmar-though the blind are reputed to possess sensitivities compensatin ' for their lack of sight , even to the point of developing para- normal psychic powers . Now clearly , seein ' the future would fall neatly into that ka-taggery . It 's not so surprising , then , if an organism deprived of earthly vision-
PETE: He said we would n't get it ! He said we would n't get the treasure we seek ! Everett grows testy
EVERETT: Well what does he know - he 's an ignorant old man ! Jesus , Pete , I 'm telling you I buried it myself , and if your cousin still runs this-here horse farm and has a forge and some shoein ' impediments to restore ou liberty of movement-

PETE: To Washington Bartholomew Hogwallop . From his loving Cora . Ay-More Fie- dellis .
EVERETT: It was in his bureau . He screws the lid back on the pomade . Delmar whistles appreciatively .
DELMAR: You got light fingers , Everett . Gopher ?
PETE: You mis'able little sneak thief He lurches threateningly to his feet .
EVERETT: Who was fixing to betray us !
PETE: You did n't know that at the time !
EVERETT: So I borrowed it till I did know !
PETE: That do n't make no sense !
EVERETT: Pete , it 's a fool looks for logic in the chambers of the human heart . What the hell 's that singing ?
VOICE: Oh Brothers , let 's go down , come on down , do n't you wan na go down
VOICES: Oh Brothers , let 's go down , down to the river to pray
DELMAR: Appears to be some kinda con- gur-gation . Care for some gopher ?
EVERETT: No , thank you Delmar - a third of a gopher would only rouse my appetite without beddin ' her back down .
DELMAR: You can have the whole thing - me ' n Pete already had one
VOICES: Oh , sisters , let 's go down , come on down , do n't you want to go down
DELMAR: We ran acrost a gopher village
WOMAN: Come with us , brothers ! Join us and e saved !
VOICES: We went down to the river one day , Studying about that good old way , And who shall wear that robe and crown , Oh Lord , show us the way
EVERETT: I guess hard times flush the chumps . Everybody 's lookin ' for answers , and there 's always-
PETE: Well , I 'll be a sonofabitch . Delmar 's een saved !
EVERETT: Pete , do n't be ignorant- Delmar is slogging back through the water .
DELMAR: Well that 's it boys , I been redeemed ! The preacher warshed away all my sins and transgressions . It 's the straight-and-narrow from here on out and heaven everlasting 's my reward !
EVERETT: Delmar what the hell are you talking about ? - We got bigger fish to fry-
DELMAR: Preacher said my sins are warshed away , including that Piggly Wiggly I knocked over in Yazoo !
EVERETT: I thought you said you were innocent a those charges .
DELMAR: Well I was lyin ' - and I 'm proud to say that that sin 's been warshed away too ! Neither God nor man 's got nothin ' on me now ! Come on in , boys , the water 's fine !
A VOICE: All tight , boys ! We got the scent !
PETE: The preacher said it absolved us .
EVERETT: For him , not for the law ! I 'm surprised at you , Pete . Hell , I gave you credit for more brains than Delmar .
DELMAR: But there were witnesses , saw us edeemed !
EVERETT: That 's not the issue , Delmar . Even if it did put you square with the Lord , the State of Mississippi is more hardnosed .
DELMAR: You should a joined us , Everett . It could n't a hurt none .
PETE: Hell , at least it woulda washed away the stink of that pomade .
EVERETT: Join you two ignorant fools in a idiculous superstition ? Thank you anyway . And I like the smell of my hair treatment - the pleasing odo is half the point . He shakes his head and laughs .
DELMAR: Pull over , Everett - let 's give that colored boy a lift .
HITCHHIKER: You folks goin ' through Tishamingo ? Delmar pushes open the back door .
DELMAR: Sure , hop in .
EVERETT: How ya doin ' , boy ? Name 's Everett , and these two soggy sonsabitches are Pete and Delmar . Keep your fingers away from Pete 's mouth-he ai n't had nothin ' to eat for the last thirteen years but prison food , gopher , and a little greasy horse .
HITCHHIKER: Thank you fuh the lif ' , suh . M'names Tommy . Tommy Johnson . Delmar is genuinely friendly
DELMAR: How ya doin ' , Tommy . I have n't seen a house in miles . What 're you doin ' out in the middle of nowhere ? Tommy is matter-of-fact
TOMMY: I had to be at that crossroads las ' midnight to sell mah soul to the devil .
EVERETT: Well ai n't it a small world , spiritually speakin ' ! Pete and Delma just been baptized and saved ! I guess I 'm the only one here who remains unaffiliated !
DELMAR: This ai n't no laughin ' matter , Everett .
EVERETT: What 'd the devil give you for you soul , Tommy ?
TOMMY: He taught me to play this guita eal good . Delmar is horrified
DELMAR: Oh , son ! For that you traded you everlastin ' soul ? ! Tommy shrugs .
TOMMY: I wudden usin ' it .
PETE: I always wondered-what 's the devil look like ?
EVERETT: Well , of course there 's all manne of lesser imps ' n demons , Pete , but the Great Satan hisself is red and scaly with a bifurcated tail and carries a hayfork .
TOMMY: Oh no ! No suh ! He 's white-white as you folks , with mirrors for eyes an ' a big hollow voice an ' allus travels with a mean old hound .
PETE: And he told you to go to Tishamingo ?
TOMMY: No suh , that was mah idea . I heard they 's a man there pays folks money to sing into a can . They say he pays extra effen you play real good .
EVERETT: How much does he pay ?
WEZY: LISTENING AI N'T NEVER BEEN SO EASY NOR SO FINE
EVERETT: All right boys , just follow my lead .
EVERETT: Who 's the honcho around here ?
MAN: I am . Hur you ?
EVERETT: Well sir , my name is Jordan Rivers and these here are the Soggy Bottom Boys outta Cottonelia Mississippi- Songs of Salvation to Salve the Soul . We hear you pay good money to sing into a can .

EVERETT: Sir , we are Negroes . All except ou a-cump- uh , company-accompluh- uh , the fella that plays the gui-tar .
MAN: Well , I do n't record Negro songs . I 'm lookin ' for some ol'-timey material . Why , people just ca n't get enough of it since we started oadcastin ' the 'Pappy O'Daniel Flour Hour ' , so thanks for stoppin ' y , but-
EVERETT: Sir , the Soggy Bottom Boys been steeped in ol'-timey material . Heck , you 're silly with it , aintcha boys ?
PETE: That 's right !
DELMAR: That 's right ! We ai n't really Negroes !
PETE: All except fer our a-cump-uh-nust !
EVERETT: Hot damn , boy , I almost believe you did sell your soul to the devil !
MAN: Boys , that was some mighty fine pickin ' and singin ' . You just sign these papers and I 'll give you ten dollars apiece .
EVERETT: Okay sir , but Mert and Aloysius 'll have to scratch Xes - only four of us can write .
DELMAR: Hey mister ! I do n't mean to be tellin ' tales out a school , but there 's a man in there hands out ten dollars to anyone sings into his can !
PAPPY: I 'm not here to make a record , ya dumb cracker , they broadcast me out on the radio .
JUNIOR: That 's Governor Menelaus 'Pass the Biscuits , Pappy ' O'Daniel , and he 'd sure 'preciate it if you ate his farina and voted him a second term .
ECKARD: Finest governor we 've ever had in M'sippi .
SPIVEY: In any state .
ECKARD: Oh Lord yes , any parish ' r precinct ; I was makin ' the larger point . As Pappy brushes by them , Junior wheedles
JUNIOR: Aintcha gon na press the flesh , Pappy , do a little politickin ' ? Pappy slaps at the young man with his hat .
PAPPY: I 'll press your flesh , you dimwitted sonofabitch - you do n't tell you pappy how to cawt the elect 'rate !
ECKARD: Oh , yes , assa parful new force .
SPIVEY: Mm-mm .

PETE: Go out west somewhere , open a fine estaurant . I 'm gon na be the maide dee . Greet all the swells , go to work ever ' day in a bowtie and tuxedo , an ' all the staff 'll all say Yassi and Nawsir and in a Jiffy Pete
EVERETT: What about you , Delmar ? What 're you gon na do with your share a that dough ?
DELMAR: Visit those foreclosin ' sonofaguns down at the Indianola Savings and Loan and slap that cash down on the arrelhead and buy back the family farm . Hell , you ai n't no kind of man if you ai n't got land .
PETE: What about you , Everett ? What 'd you have in mind when you stoled it in the first place ?
EVERETT: Me ? Oh , I did n't have no plan . Still do n't , really .
PETE: Well that hardly sounds like you A distant Voice
VOICE: All right , boys , itsy authorities ! The three men tense up . Tommy stops singing .
EVERETT: Damn ! They found our car !
MAN: We ai n't got the time-and nary inclination-to gentle you boys no further !
DELMAR: Damn ! We got ta skedaddle !
EVERETT: I left my pomade in that car ! Maybe I can creep up !
DELMAR: Do n't be a fool , Everett , we got ta R- U-N-O-F-F-T , but pronto !
EVERETT: Where 's Tommy ?
PETE: Already lit out , scared out of his wits . Let 's go !
PETE: The hell it ai n't square one ! Ai n't no one gon na pick up three filthy unshaved hitchhikers , and one of 'em a know-it-all that ca n't keep his trap shut !
EVERETT: Pete , the personal rancor reflected in that remark I do n't intend to dignify with comment , but I would like to address your general attitude of hopeless negativism . Consider the lilies a the goddamn field , or-hell ! - take a look at Delmar here as you paradigm a hope .
DELMAR: Yeah , look at me .
EVERETT: Now you may call it an unreasoning optimism . You may call it obtuse . But the plain fact is we still have close to close to
DRIVER: Is this the road to Itta Bena ?
PETE: Uh Itta Bena
EVERETT: Itta Bena , now , uh , that would be

DRIVER: Hop on in while you give it a think .

CLERK: No , ma'am , we had a new shipment in yesterday but we just ca n't keep it on the shelves . The sad-faced woman is crestfallen .
PETE: Shutup , Delmar .
EVERETT: I guess o ' Pete 's got the itch .
PETE: Howdy do , ladies . Name of Pete !
EVERETT: Aintcha gon na innerduce us , Pete ?
PETE: Do n't know their names . I seen 'em first ! Everett laughs lightly .
EVERETT: Ladies , you 'll have to pardon my friend here ; Pete is dirt-ignorant and unschooled in the social arts . My name on the other hand is Ulysses Everett McGill and you ladies are about the three prettiest water lilies it 's ever been my privilege to admire .
EVERETTE: Mm . Corn licker , I guess , uh , the preferred local uh
DELMAR: Pleased to meet you , ma'am .
PETE: Damn !
DELMAR: Holy Saint Christopher ! He toes Everett urgently in the ribs .
EVERETT: Whuhh
DELMAR: Oh sweet Lord , Everett , looka this !
EVERETT: PETE ! Where the heck are ya ! We ai n't got time for your shenanigans !
DELMAR: Sweet Jesus , Everett ! They left his heart !
EVERETT: What on earth is goin ' on here ! What 's got into you , Delmar !
DELMAR: Caintcha see it Everett ! Them sigh- eens did this to Pete ! They loved him up an ' turned him into a horney- toad ! The toad hops down the river bank .
EVERETT: I 'm not sure that 's Pete .
DELMAR: Course it 's Pete ! Look at 'im ! The frog croaks .
EVERETT: I 'm just not sure that 's Pete .
EVERETT: You ca n't display a toad in a fine estaurant like this ! Why , the good folks here 'd go right off their feed !
DELMAR: I just do n't think it 's right , keepin ' him under wraps like we 's ashamed of him .
EVERETT: Well if that is Pete I am ashamed of him . The way I see it he got what he deserved - fornicating with some whore a Babylon . These things- He points a knife at the shoebox .
DELMAR: The two of us was fixing to fornicate !
EVERETT: Heh-heh . You 'll have to excuse my usticated friend here , unaccustomed as he is to city manners . He ostentatiously fans some of his money .
EVERETT: And I do n't suppose the chef 'd have any nits or grubs in the pantry , or - naw , never mind , just bring me a couple leafs a raw cabbage .
WAITRESS: Yes sir . The big man appears as she leaves .
BIG MAN: Do n't believe I 've seen you boys around here before ! Allow me t'innerduce myself name of Daniel Teague , known in these precincts as Big Dan Teague or , to those who 're pressed for time , Big Dan toot court .
EVERETT: How d'you do , Big Dan . I 'm Ulysses Everett McGill ; this is my associate Delmar O'Donnell . I sense that , like me , you are endowed with the gift of gab . Big Dan chuckles as he draws up a chair .
BIG DAN: I flatter myself that such is the case ; in my line of work it 's plum necessary . The one thing you do n't want is air in the conversation .
EVERETT: Once again we find ourselves in agreement . What kind of work do you do , Big Dan ?
BIG DAN: Sales , Mr. McGill , sales ! And what do I sell ? The Truth ! Ever ' blessed word of it , from Genesee on down to Revelations ! That 's right , the word of God , which let me add there is damn good money in during these days of woe and want ! Folks 're lookin ' for answers and Big Dan Teague sells the only book that 's got 'em ! What do you do - you and your tongue-tied friend ?
DELMAR: Uh , we uh-
EVERETT: We 're adventurers , sir , currently pursuin ' a certain opportunity but open to others as well .
BIG DAN: I like your style , young man , so I 'm gon na propose you a proposition . You cover my check so I do n't have to un back up to my room , have you waitress wrap your dinner picnic- style , and we 'll retire to more private environs where I will explain to you how vast amounts of money can e made in the service of God Amighty . Everett rises and digs in his pocket .
EVERETT: Well , why not . If nothing else I could use some civilized conversation .
BIG DAN: Do n't forget your shoebox , friend .
PAPPY: Languishing ! Goddamn campaign is languishing ! We need a shot inna arm ! Hear me , boys ? Inna goddamn ARM ! Election held tomorra , that sonofabitch Stokes would win it in a walk !
JUNIOR: Well he 's the reform candidate , Daddy .
PAPPY: Yeah ?
JUNIOR: Well people like that reform . Maybe we should get us some .
PAPPY: I 'll reform you , you soft-headed sonofabitch ! How we gon na run reform when we 're the damn incumbent ! He glares around the table .
ECKARD: Okay , Pappy . Pappy whips him back down with his hat .
PAPPY: I 'm just makin ' a point , you stupid sonofabitch !
ECKARD: Okay , Pappy .
BIG DAN: Thankee boys for throwin ' in that fricasee . I 'm a man a large appetite and even with lunch under my belt I was feeling a mite peckish .
EVERETT: Our pleasure , Big Dan .
BIG DAN: And thank you as well for that conversational hiatus ; I generally efrain from speech while engaged in gustation . There are those who attempt oth at the same time but I find it course and vulgar . Now where were we ?
DELMAR: Makin ' money in the Lord 's service .
BIG DAN: You do n't say much friend , but when you do it 's to the point and I salute you for it . Delmar is pleased and embarrassed .
DELMAR: Oh , it were n't nothin ' , I-
BIG DAN: Yes , Bible sales . The trade is not a complicated one ; there 're but two things to learn . One bein ' where to find your wholesaler - word of God in bulk as it were . Two bein ' how to eckanize your customer - who 're you dealin ' with ? - an exercise in psychology so to speak .
EVERETT: I like to think that I 'm a pretty astute observer of the human scene .
BIG DAN: No doubt , brother - I figured as much back there in the restaurant . That 's why I invited you out here for this advanced tutorial .
EVERETT: What 's goin ' on , Big Dan ?
BIG DAN: It 's all about money , boys ! Atsy answer ! Dough re mi !
DELMAR: No you do n't understand
BIG DAN: Do n't you boys know these things give ya warts ?
DELMAR: Oh Lord Pete Big Dan is over at the car , cranking it up .
BIG DAN: End of lesson . He climbs in .
DELMAR: Pete Pete Pete
VOICE: Where are they ? ! There is the sound of a lash and a scream .
COOLEY: Lump . I.O .
PETE: Goddamnit !
EVERETT: Believe me , Delmar , he would 've wanted us to press on . Pete , rest his soul , was one sour-assed sonofabitch and not given to acts of pointless sentimentality . Delmar doggedly shakes his head .
DELMAR: It just do n't seem right , diggin ' up that treasure without him .
EVERETT: Maybe it 's for the best that Pete was squushed . Why , he was barely a sentient bein ' . Now , soon as we clean ourselves up , get a little smell'um in our hair , we 're just gon na feel a hunnert per cent better about ourselves and about
DELMAR: Not that I 'm aware . Everett shakes his head as if to clear it .
EVERETT: Heat must be gettin ' to me . The truck rattles on .
STOKES: And I say to you that the great state a Mississippi can not afford fou more years a Pappy O'Daniel - fou more years a cronyism , nepotism , ascalism and service to the Innarests ! The choice , she 's a clea 'un Pappy O'Daniel , slave a the Innarests ; Homer Stokes , servant a the little man ! Ai n't that right , little fella ? The midget enthusiastically seconds

EVERETT: I shoulda guessed it - typical womanly ehavior . Just lucky we left before they came for us .
DELMAR: We did n't abandon you , Pete , we just thought you was a toad .
PETE: No , they never did turn me into a toad .
DELMAR: Well that was our mistake then . And then we was beat up by a bible salesman and banished from Woolworth 's . I do n't know if it 's the one branch or all of 'em .

PETE: With my added time for the escape , I do n't get out now 'til 1987 I 'll be eighty-four years old .
DELMAR: Huh . I guess they 'll tack on fifty years for me too .
EVERETT: Boys , we was chained together . I hadda tell ya somethin ' . Bustin ' out alone was not a option !
PETE: Eighty-four years old . Delmar brightens .
DELMAR: I 'll only be eighty-two . Pete lunges at Everett .

EVERETT: No , this is gon na work ! I just got ta get close enough to talk to her . Takin ' off with us is got a lot more future in it than marrying a guy named Waldrip . I 'm goddamn bona fide . I 've got the answers !
WALDRIP: Well that 's a improper suggestion ! I ca n't switch sides in the middle of a campaign ! Especially to work for a man who lacks moral fibre !
PAPPY: Moral fibre ? ! He waves his cane , outraged .
VOICE: Psst ! Penny ! Hey ! Up here !
EVERETT: Penny ! It 's me !

JUNIOR: But Pappy , they 's inter-grated .
PAPPY: Well I guess folks do n't mind they 's integrated .
STOKES: Wait a minute
PAPPY: Goddamn ! Oppitunity knocks ! He starts clambering up onto the stage .
EVERETT: Sure is , Governor .
PAPPY: Why then I say , by the par vested in me , these boys is hereby pardoned !
DELMAR: What sat mean exactly , Everett ?
EVERETT: Well , you ' n me ' n Pete ' n Tommy are gon na be the power behind the throne so to speak .

EVERETT: Governor - that 's one of ou favorites ! Pappy returns a considered appraisal
PAPPY: Son , you gon na go far . The song begins .
EVERETT: I guess Vernon T. Waldrip is gon na e goin ' on relief . Maybe I 'll be able to throw a little patronage his way , get the man a job diggin ' ditches or rounding up stray dogs .
DELMAR: Is the marriage off then , Miz Wharvey ?
PENNY: McGill . No , the marriage 'll take place as planned .
EVERETT: Just a little change of cast . Me and the little lady are gon na pick up the pieces ' n retie the knot , mixaphorically speakin ' . You boys 're invited , of course . Hell , you 're est men ! Already got the rings .
PENNY: I ai n't worn it since our divorce came through . It must still be in the rolltop in the old cabin . Neve thought I 'd need it ; Vernon bought one encrusted with jewels .
EVERETT: Hell , now 's the time to buy it off him cheap .
PENNY: We ai n't gettin ' married with his ing ! You said you 'd changed !
EVERETT: Aw , honey , our ring is just a old pewter thing -
PENNY: Ai n't gon na be no weddin ' .
EVERETT: It 's just a symbol , honey -

PENNY: I have spoken my piece and counted to three . She walks off .
EVERETT: Oh , goddamnit ! She counted to three ! Sonofabitch ! You know how far that cabin is ? !
DELMAR: George !
GEORGE: 'Lo , boys ! Well , these little men finally caught up with the criminal a the century ! Looks like the chai for George Nelson . Yup ! Gon na electrify me ! I 'm gon na go off like a Roman candle ! Twenty thousand volts chasin ' the rabbit through yours truly ! Gon na shoot sparks out the top of my head and lightning from my fingertips !
DELMAR: Looks like George is right back on top again .
EVERETT: Well , at least you boys 'll get to see the old manse - the home where I spent so many happy days in the bosom of my family - a refugium , if you will - with a mighty oak tree out front and a happy little tire swing
DELMAR: Where 's the happy little tire swing ?
COOLEY: End of the road , boys . It 's had its twists and turns -
EVERETT: Waitaminute -
COOLEY: - but now it deposits you here .
EVERETT: Waitaminute -
COOLEY: You have eluded fate - and eluded me - for the last time . Tie their hands , oys .
EVERETT: You ca n't do this -
COOLEY: Did n't know you 'd be bringin ' a friend . Well , he 'll have to wait his turn -
EVERETT: Hang on there -
COOLEY: - and share one of your graves .
EVERETT: You ca n't do this - we just been pardoned ! By the Governer himself !
DELMAR: It went out over the radio !
COOLEY: Is that right ?
PETE: God have Mercy !
TOMMY: It ai n't fittin ' !
EVERETT: It ai n't the law !
COOLEY: The law . Well the law is a human institution . Cooley gives the faintest smile .
PETE: Oh my God ! Everett !
DELMAR: I 'm sorry we got you into this , Tommy .
PETE: Good Lord , what do we do ?
EVERETT: Oh Lord , please look down and ecognize us poor sinners please Lord
DELMAR: A miracle ! It was a miracle !
EVERETT: Aw , do n't be ignorant , Delmar . I told you they was gon na flood this valley .
DELMAR: That ai n't it !
PETE: We prayed to God and he pitied us !
EVERETT: It just never fails ; once again you two hayseeds are showin ' how much you want for innalect . There 's a perfectly scientific explanation fo what just happened -
PETE: That ai n't the tune you were singin ' ack there at the gallows !
EVERETT: Well any human being will cast about in a moment of stress . No , the fact is , they 're flooding this valley so they can hydro-electric up the whole durned state Everett waxes smug
TOMMY: Rolltop desk

PENNY: That 's right , honey .
EVERETT: But I do n't mind telling you , I 'm awful pleased my adventuring days is at an end He fumbles in his pocket .
PENNY: That 's good , honey .
EVERETT: And you were right about that ring . Any other weddin ' band would not do . But this-here was foreordained , honey ; fate was a-smilin ' on me , and ya have to have confidence - He is slipping it onto her hand .

EVERETT: Well , I 'm sorry honey -
PENNY: Well , we need that ring .
EVERETT: Well now honey , that ring is at the ottom of a pretty durned big lake .
PENNY: Uh-huh .

VICTORIA: Okay , we 've got another Drone downed last night .
JACK: Send it .
VICTORIA: Would you like to set a course to eserve fuel ?
SMALL SMILE: Absolutely not . Bar gaucre hits top . Jack punches it .
VICTORIA: Yo no se . No data . It 's not transmitting . Tet coverage will go live in 11 minutes .
JACK: You know , I actually read about this game . Giants are literally on their own seven with 25 seconds on the clock
VICTORIA: Please do not reminisce on my Comm , thank you very much .
JACK: Anyway QB lets off this mile- high bomb
VICTORIA: Jack I have no scope . The Tet is still offline .
JACK: And at the one yard line interception . Devastation . It 's all over .
JACK: But the guy 's too eager . He starts running it back . Everyone 's yelling `` Fall down , just fall down ! ''
VICTORIA: What do you mean taken ? Was it a malfunction ?
JACK: No It 's a master drone , too . 166 . Looks like it was hit mid flight , managed to limp its way here . Watch my back , I 'm starting field repair .
VICTORIA: Jack , you need to get out of there . Bring it home to the shop .
JACK: So the guy keeps running . 30 , 40 , 50 yards and BAM ! He gets pasted . Ball goes loose
VICTORIA: Jack , you know they can weaponize a fuel cell .
STARTING WORK: And would n't you know it , Giants ecover , start running it back . Total insanity .
VICTORIA: I 'm reading the whole central core off alignment , you do n't have the necessary tools .
JACK: Bob , I said I needed
JACK: Hey there , boy . Easy Jack moves forward , hand out .
VICTORIA: Jesus , Jack . What the hell was that ?
SPITTING ASH: Call in number 166 for service up top . It 's practically got its motherboard and half its hydraulics hanging out . But it still wants to kill everybody
VICTORIA: Jack , what happened ? Nowtrudging to the ship
JACK: I 'll see you at the house later . You want anything ? Milk ? Bread ? Anything else that does n't exist ?
VICTORIA: You .
JACK: Well if you want anybody else , you 're out of luck . He boards the BUBBLESHIP .
VICTORIA: We only have two more months , Jack . Please try to resist the urge to do something stupid .
BEAT: There 's no other service signals . Come home .
JACK: No
VICTORIA: There 's no Drone signal there .
BEAT: What are you doing , Jack ?
JACK: One day when we get to Mars , someone will want to know about this . From someone who was here .
VICTORIA: It 's not doing anyone any good here .
JACK: Actually I 've got a bit of a problem with a gyro here , call you when I 've fixed it .
JACK: .There you are . An instant of BLACK
JACK: Vika , you 're not going to elieve

VICTORIA: You 're not supposed to bring up surface items .
JACK: No . I 'm not supposed to bring them in the house .
VICTORIA: I tried to reach you earlier If we 're going to be an effective
JACK: You 're right .
VICTORIA: Then you ca n't just
JACK: Ah-ha . So it 's okay when I bring you something . But if I
VICTORIA: I know you think I 'm a stickle for the rules , but you have no idea what sort of toxins could be in something like that . He chuckles
JACK: It was just a plant , Victoria .
VICTORIA: That 's not the point . We have two more months and the last thing we need is you putting it all at isk .
CONCERNED: You 're hurt . What happened ?
VICTORIA: This is gon na pinch a little
JACK: Hit me .
AFFECTIONATE: Serves you right . She kisses him on the forehead , turns away .
VICTORIA: .I 'm not saying you ca n't go into your caverns , I 'm saying we have a job and if I 'm trying to each you and you 're off on one of your adventures
JACK: Look , they trained me to fix drones . That 's my job , I get that . But it 's not what I am . I ca n't simply do the same thing over and over again , every day , with that world down there . And if mission has a better Drone tech , they can get him to baby- sit .
VICTORIA: It 's only a little while longer . The Gatherer 's have collected most of the resources we need for Mars . Pretty soon
JACK: Pretty soon , there wo n't be anything left down there . No more plant life , no more water .
VICTORIA: You act like there 's not a wa going on down there but there is and we ca n't leave even two of those things alive
NO RESPONSE: Dammit , Jack . They nearly killed you today . They eat in silence for a moment , then
JACK: Actually , it was like they were trying to catch me . Guess I look tasty .
VICTORIA: Please be careful . If they get to you , what happens to me ?
PLEADING: Jack .
JACK: Come on .
VICTORIA: Can you imagine when we go back up ? Having a face to face conversation again ? I ca n't elieve it 's finally ending .
TOASTING HIM: We made it . Jack looks away
JACK: It 's not so bad down here . They certainly do n't have anything like this .
VICTORIA: I wonder what duty I would have pulled . Probably programming the Mars boats .
JACK: I 'd have been overhauling the zero- G toilets .
SHE LAUGHS: I 'm serious , it 's dangerous work . I mean , you think you have control of the situation . He swims closer . She smiles , he presses on .
VICTORIA: Stop !
JACK: It 's awful . Just thinking about it , I get afraid
SUDDENLY: I 've been happy here . With you . I ca n't remember zero gravity . Physically . Can you ?
JACK: Here , let me show you
VICTORIA: I should have seen that coming .
VICTORIA: Do n't go out today until we get a signal .
JACK: .Then what would you say in you eport ? Victoria looks away , stuck .
VICTORIA: A hundred terraformed acres on Mars is all you have to think about .
TO HERSELF: I love you .

JACK: It 's the Empire State
VICTORIA: It 's ancient history , Jack . You know the procedure . Blow it .
JACK: Yeah , I may have seen anothe drone trap
VICTORIA: You 're at the edge of range , Jack . You 're starting to break up .
JACK: It 's okay
SERIOUS: No , it 's not okay . You get in too close that radiation
JACK: will cook me from the inside efore I know it . Do n't worry , I 'm still more than five clicks from the beacons
VICTORIA: What are you out there Jack ?
JACK: That 's right , Bob . You know where we 're going .
VICTORIA: Jack ?
VICTORIA: Mission , this is Lieutenant Victoria Kohl , requesting a link . I may have a situation A beat while the connection is made , then

VICTORIA: Will communicate findings on next Tet cycle . Understood .
JACK: So , um Victoria . The ROVER shifts , confused .
JACK: Bob ! Let 's get going !
JACK: Vika ? Vika , did you get that ? An object hit near here . A ship .
VICTORIA: Where the hell have you been ? Jack 's silent , not wanting to lie .
JACK: I saw it through optics in the last minute . I 'm not sure it was alien .

JACK: There are people here , and they 're killing them !
JACK: It 's you
RATIONALIZING: Well it did n't recognize her . It 's machinery . It 's programmed
JACK: She came off a NASA shuttle . The drones were specifically targeting the pods
VICTORIA: I do n't know what the machinery did or did n't do . There 's protocol
JACK: Protocol ? Protocol ? ! Who 's the machinery now , Victoria ?
VICTORIA: Go get the cutter , and a breather , and my big bag . Now . The Pod 's een damaged , she 's not doing well , let 's get her out of there .

JULIA: Have you ever seen a ship like that ?
JACK: No . No , of course not . This answers something important for Julia .
JULIA: I wonder what brought us back ?
JACK: .There was a transmission . I do n't know who sent it .
JULIA: We 'll never really know without the flight recorder . She says we ca n't go down there , that it 's too dangerous . He laughs a little , shakes his head .
JACK: Funnily enough , you 've found you man .

JULIA: So I guess I 'm around a hundred years old .
BEAT: What happened next ? He gestures towards the moon ring in the sky .
JACK: The Scavs assumed taking out the moon would wipe us out , and it almost did . But we re-grouped , fought back . We beat them in the end . She glances at him .
JULIA: A dry planet He nods at the Tet , rising in the distance .
JACK: Yeah . What 's left of us are up there now , ready to go where you were headed , Mars . 40 acres and a mule . What we 've got left . What you 've got . Julia stares out at the Tet .

BEECH: Interesting , Jack . Interesting . You 're worried I might be some kind of Collaborator . Jack does n't respond .
ASIDE: Lllllllights !
INHALING SMOKE: The Drones still kill us , but they 're not nearly so aggressive as when they smell a human target . Did you ever ask yourself why that is ?
JACK: No , they 're programmed to
BEECH: To what , Jack ?
OFF JULIA: You saw it yourself . You almost got yourself blown to bits protecting her . I 've been meaning to ask you , why did you do that ?
JACK: Anyone would have
BEECH: Anyone . Would have . Interesting .
BEECH: We grow what we can , under the lights . It is n't much ; Wheat- grass , some vegetables , what beans and soy we can . The general state of our health proves that human eings are not herbivores , but the alternative is not appetizing to anybody .
SARDONIC WINK: Not yet , anyway .
JACK: When we get you up to the Tet , there 's plenty -
BEECH: There is ? Plenty . Plenty of what ?

FRUSTRATED: Yes , I mean . I do n't know . Tet Comm Status `` COMMUNICATION ENDED . ''
JULIA: Jack , what he said about the Tet
JACK: It took three decades to build the Tet . And when it was finally eady and it was time to go up , there were people who refused . Leaders , who told their people to stay .
VICTORIA'S VOICE: Jack ! Jack ! There 's something coming your way . JACK ! ! ! !
JACK'S VOICE: .It 'll be fine . Trust me .
VICTORIA'S VOICE: I 'm trying to .
JACK'S VOICE: I 'll be home for breakfast .

VICTORIA'S VOICE: What are you doing out there so far , Jack ?
JULIA: The bomb
BEECH: I know what I did . But tell us , Commander , why did you have a bom on board , what was it for ? Tell him .
JULIA: The Tet is an alien ship , Jack . The odyssey 's mission - Ou mission , was to investigate it . Jack shakes his head no . Angry
BEECH: It attacked us . First it destroyed our moon . Then it unleashed its primary weapon , a illiant weapon
JACK: I was born there !
BEECH: I was born in Chicago , Jack . I used to go to baseball games with my father . I used to get two big hot dogs , fill 'em up with relish , and mustard . Just go to town . Me and my pops , watching the sox . You have any memories like that Jack ?
JACK: No , my father was a
BEECH: Was what ? Tall ? Fat ? He yell at your mom ? Ever go to a baseball game , Jack ?

JULIA: It was you , Jack .
JACK: What ?
JULIA: You and Victoria . We were all on the Odyssey . We were supposed to make contact
JACK: No .
BEECH: The Tet is an alien vessel , Commander Jack Harper . It came and destroyed our moon and most of humanity when it did . And eve since , with your help , it 's been trying to finish the job .
BEAT: I 'm sorry , Jack . It 's not good news , I know . You 've been turned to the wrong side . Beech goes to the BOMB , stares down at it
JACK: You 're insane . This is insane . He turns to Julia , but she wo n't help him .
BEECH: What ? People like you ? We are the last real people .
SHOULDERS: But you can , repairman . That is the beautiful irony . It gave you the skills .
SYKES: It followed him here . I told you this was a mistake !
BEECH: Well well , we may be out of time . Set the Drone to return to the Tet upon reactivation . It needs to go ight to the center
JACK: No ! It will kill -
RAGING: It will kill that ugly stain on the sky . That 's all ! Now program the Drone !
JACK: No . I wo n't do it .
SYKES: He wo n't help us . We bury them oth , make our run as soon as we can load up .
JACK: You know I stare into weapons every day , so you can put that away . Because here 's what I can tell you If the Rover found us , the Drones will too . Unless you want them to find you , let me get somewhere where I can send a signal . Somewhere far from here . Beech caught .
IGNORING SYKES: What 's your plan , Jack ? Tell the Tet where we are , so they can send a nice big welcome
JACK: The Drones would kill you . Let me try to stop that .
SYKES: You ca n't trust him !
JACK: You 're wasting time . On Beech , Sykes
BEECH: Well , you 're the repairman .
JACK: I 'll get to the antenna , send a signal with my location . The Tet will call off the search . .You should be safe , for now . Jack starts to go .
BEECH: Jack What if I told you that I had been to your radiation zones . And what I found there Would change everything you think you know about the world .
SYKES: What makes you think he 's any different from the others ? Beech stares at him a moment , then back out .
BEECH: She does . Beech turns away .
JULIA: What happened ?
JACK: The Scavs brought it down ten years ago . All . this time , I thought we were at war with the Scavs but it turns out we were just killing each other .
LAUGHING: .And I want a dishwasher , the kind that you can put
JACK'S VOICE: I do n't think they 'll have those on Mars , Honey .
VICTORIA'S VOICE: Okay , fine . No dishwasher . How about just you . All the time .
JACK'S VOICE: Yes . When we get there .
JULIA: What will you do now ?
JACK: That old man is smart . Those fuel cells , the way he 's got them tied in with your device He could low the whole station .
JULIA: Jack , you ca n't turn them in . He glances at her , shakes his head .
JACK: What do you want from me ? I 'm just a repairman .
BEAT: This is bigger than me .
CAREFULLY: You and I started the same year at
JACK: Look , stop , okay ? Just
JULIA: But for you , it was always the stars . You wanted to fly furthe and faster than any one else .

JULIA: I 'm talking about a man I knew , who was fearless . A man who would n't bow out of a fight , ever .
JACK: STOP ! You and that old man have this story Except I know who I am , okay ? I know who I am !
JULIA: No , you do n't . That thing ainwashed you , it erased you

MARK: I know , it 's horrible .
RONNIE: You want me to phone this one in to the police ?

RONNIE: Hold on , Mark . Let me make sure I understand you . You 're telling me to deny my primary objective of Observing and Reporting crime and at the same time , you 're giving me authorization to handle this case on my own .

BRANDI: No .
RONNIE: Well , I 'm sure you will . It 's actually pretty huge news . But the reason I stopped by is to tell you that it looks like we 've got a pervert on the loose . A real live psychopath who gains sexual gratification by exposing himself to ladies such as yourself . I just want to warn you to be careful when coming and going to work .
BRANDI: Okay , got it .
RONNIE: And you may not want to wear any of those skirts that you like to wear .
BRANDI: What skirts ?
RONNIE: You know what skirts . Something like that could set him off . And for that matter , you better not wear any of those little low-cut top things either , okay ? Especially with those black bras ecause , you can really see them in the light . Perverts really tend to notice stuff like that . Okay , see you later .
RONNIE: Dennis , man , I 'm glad we 've got a minute to talk . There 's no easy way to say this so I 'm just going to come right out with it . Mark offered me the position of Head of Mall Security . I know this is n't easy for you to hear seeing as you 've been here longer than me .

RONNIE: Luck has nothing to do with it .
MOM: You almost broke my arm .
RONNIE: I 'm sorry , Mom . Are you okay ?
MOM: Not really .
MOM: I 'm so proud of you , Ronnie .
RONNIE: Do you think I did good ?
MOM: Hell yes . You were great .
RONNIE: Ah , you 're just drunk .
MOM: Nah , you did good .
RONNIE: Yeah , I usually do n't come out to the forefront like that .
RONNIE: You working the door here ?
BOUNCER: That 's what they tell me . They needed to hire a little security here in case the drunks get out of line or whatever .
RONNIE: Kind of funny they thought they needed more security here . Ha . You do realize that if anyone gets out of hand , you need to call me to handle the situation .
BOUNCER: I work for O'Charley 's , not fo the mall .
RONNIE: Granted , but you realize that my jurisdiction supersedes any and all other forms of security when under the roof of Carolina Mall ?
BOUNCER: You know , I thought about getting a job as a Mall Security .
RONNIE: You did ?
BOUNCER: Yeah , man . I mean , I 'm kind of on extended vacation from college and it 's just like , I do n't want to do shit , you know what I mean ? My parents said I have to work if I want to live at home , but I just do n't feel like doing anything . This was the easiest job I could find , I mean , what the hell could e hard about being a bouncer in a mall restaurant ? But now that I think about it , Mall Security could be easier than this .
RONNIE: My young friend , you are sorely mistaken . Do you know how much stuff I 'm in charge of ?
BOUNCER: No .
RONNIE: A shitload . That 's not even counting the parking lot .
BOUNCER: Really ? I thought you just kind of chilled out and called stuff into the police .
RONNIE: No way , that 's about like 75 , maybe 82 percent of it . There 's so much other stuff .
BOUNCER: Like what ?
RONNIE: Two words , Friday Night .
BOUNCER: What about it ?
RONNIE: It 's crazy , let 's just leave it at that .
BOUNCER: Okay .
RONNIE: Listen . I like you , but I do n't like the fact that you 're masquerading as an official in the security world . If you 're serious about a career in the security world , then perhaps I could look into getting you a job on my staff ?
BOUNCER: Oh yeah ?
RONNIE: Part of my job is reaching out to troubled youths such as yourself . It 's who I am .
BOUNCER: Does it pay more than $ 6.50 an hour ?
WHISPERING: Seven even .
BOUNCER: I 'd say that 's more than I 'm making now .
RONNIE: Hold on , this job involves a probationary period . You have to prove yourself worthy . We ca n't just hire any old Tom , Dick , o Harry just because they want to carry a flashlight .
BOUNCER: What do I have to do ?
RONNIE: You have to complete a term as deputy . You will answer directly to me . Your job will be to come and find me if you see any trouble . If this works out , then I will phone the crime into the police . Now , this will train you eyes to spot various criminal activity . Once you have completed your training , you will be awarded an official position on my security staff where you will have the duty of actually phoning in crimes to the police yourself .
BOUNCER: So basically , I just do what I 'm doing now and then you 'll get me a job ?
RONNIE: For starters .
BOUNCER: How long does this mentorship last ?
RONNIE: Until Mark lets me hire anothe guy .
BOUNCER: Can I smoke while I work ?
RONNIE: Yes , you can .
BOUNCER: Sign me up .
RONNIE: You keep that attitude up and you 'll have no problem making the squad .
BOUNCER: What 's this ?
RONNIE: It 's a flashlight . Get to know it . It 's your new best friend . Until you get your giant flashlight . Then , that will be your new best friend .
MARK: Alright , people , she 's doing good . We 're just gon na get her down to my office and everything 's going to be fine , so the best thing fo you employees to do is just get on ack to your stations and you customers can go ahead and enjoy the back to school savings here at Carolina Mall .
BRANDI: It was horrible ! Oh , my God , the thought of that disgusting I think I 'm going to be sick .
BRUCE: Just let it out , baby . He should e ashamed !
BRANDI: I just keep playing it over and over again in my head .
MARK: Brandi , please , Dennis has called the police and let 's just take this down to my office .
BRUCE: A Pervert attacked Brandi is what 's going on !
BRANDI: Physically , yes . But psychologically , no !
WHISPERING: Did you call the cops ?
MARK: They 're on the way .
RONNIE: Brandi ! I came as soon as I heard . Jesus , are you alright ?
BRANDI: I 'm fine , Ronnie .
MARK: She 's fine , Ronnie .
RONNIE: This is one of the most heinous things I 've seen . Jesus , I tried to tell you about the skirts . It 's not your fault , you little fighter you . Ronnie 's not mad , okay ?
MARK: Ronnie , can you get her down to my office so the Police can talk to her in private when they arrive .
RONNIE: Rogers .
BRANDI: I ca n't walk right now . I feel like I 'm in shock .
RONNIE: Do n't worry . I 'll carry you .
MARK: Oh , fucking Jesus .
DETECTIVE HARRISON: Your secretary told me to come on in . I 'm Detective Harrison , Cabarrus County Police .
MARK: Mark Talbert , I manage the mall . This is Brandi , she 's the one who saw the deviant .
DETECTIVE HARRISON: Hello , Brandi . Are you doing okay ?
BRANDI: I 'm really shaken up .
DETECTIVE HARRISON: Yes , ma'am , I 'm sure you are afte all you 've been through , but I 'm here to tell you that we 're going to work together to make sure we catch the person who did this .
RONNIE: My name is Ronnie Barnhardt , chief inspector on the case and head of Mall Security here at Carolina Mall and this is my lieutenant , Dennis . From one law enforcement officer to another , I just want to welcome you and say that we will do whatever it takes to coordinate with your department in order to ing this assailant to justice .
DETECTIVE HARRISON: Great . Okay , Brandi . Did you get a look at the suspect ?
BRANDI: Yes , I did .
RONNIE: Did you get a blood sample ?
BRANDI: No .
RONNIE: That 's a shame . Would have been useful .
MARK: Go ahead , Detective .
DETECTIVE HARRISON: Thank you . Brandi , can you emember anything specifically ? What color was his hair ? Was he tall or short ?
BRANDI: He was tall and skinny and he had own hair and it was real greasy .
DETECTIVE HARRISON: Was his hair long or short ?
BRANDI: It was long about to his shoulders .
DETECTIVE HARRISON: Did he say anything ?
BRANDI: No , he just stood there and you know , touched himself .
DETECTIVE HARRISON: What was he wearing ?
BRANDI: Just a brown trench coat .
RONNIE: This is what I got so far .
DETECTIVE HARRISON: I just wrote a description .
RONNIE: Oh .
DETECTIVE HARRISON: Okay , Brandi , I think that 's good for now . I think the best thing at this point is to just follow up with the other ladies who saw the perpetrator yesterday and see if they remember anything .
BRANDI: What if he comes back ?
DETECTIVE HARRISON: That 's highly unlikely . These incidents are usually random and unpredictable . I 'm sure you 'll be safe .
RONNIE: I 'm afraid I 'm going to have to disagree with you there , Detective . By my math , it seems pretty clear that Brandi 's been targeted .
DETECTIVE HARRISON: Targeted ? What gives you that impression ?
RONNIE: Well , how about the fact that she was the first employee to get assaulted ? Not to mention the fact that she is the prettiest girl who works at this mall . To me it seems obvious that this is some sort of methodical villain that plans on returning to finish what he started by murdering Brandi .
BRANDI: Is that going to happen ? !
DETECTIVE HARRISON: That 's not going to happen .
RONNIE: That 's right , Brandi , you 've got the best team in law enforcement working for you .
DETECTIVE HARRISON: Look , I 've got to get going . Here 's my card . I 'll even write my home phone number on the back , just in the event you need to get a hold of me .
DETECTIVE HARRISON: Give me a call when you are n't working and I 'll have you come to the station to look through some mug shots . Do n't worry okay .
BRANDI: I feel a lot better now .
DETECTIVE HARRISON: What ?
RONNIE: I 'll take one of those cards as well .
DETECTIVE HARRISON: Oh , okay .
RONNIE: Go ahead and write your home phone on there as well in case I need to get a hold of you .
DETECTIVE HARRISON: You can just leave a message at the station . I check my messages constantly .
RONNIE: Sorry , but I 'm gon na need those digits . If we 're gon na solve this crime we need to constantly be in communication with each other and have an open door policy with intelligence . Brandi , let me see that card .
DETECTIVE HARRISON: Do n't do that .
RONNIE: It 's no problem at all . We 're others of the badge . This is what we do for each other .
NELL: What are you doing ?
RONNIE: Just putting these posters up .
NELL: You 've been so obsessed with catching this pervert I 've barely seen you .
RONNIE: That 's what it 's like when you date the Head of Mall Security . The downside is we do n't get to see each other as much , but the upside is you get to brag to all your friends .
NELL: Well , are you ready to go ?
RONNIE: Sure , let 's take off .
NELL: What are you doing , Ronnie ?
RONNIE: Come on , let me get some of those ig bazoombas .
NELL: Ronnie , no .
RONNIE: Goddamn it , are we ever gon na do it ?
NELL: You know we talked about this .
RONNIE: We did , it 's just , well , I 'm tired of just doing what we do . I 'm eady for something bigger . Like sex or just maybe using a finge on you
NELL: Ronnie , you know I 'm saving myself for marriage . I thought you were okay with that .
RONNIE: Well , I used to be , it 's just . I do n't know . What 's so great about eing a 27-year-old virgin ?
NELL: I thought you loved my purity .
RONNIE: I do . I really do . I 'm sorry , Nell .
NELL: It 's okay . I should leave anyway , it 's late .
RONNIE: I 'll stop by for breakfast tomorrow .
NELL: See ya tomorrow .
RONNIE: Mom , wake up . Let 's go to bed .
RONNIE: Good to see you , brother . Looks like the old team is getting together to crack one more case .
DETECTIVE HARRISON: Thanks for waking me up this morning , Ronnie .
RONNIE: I 've already checked the Security tapes . They did n't catch a thing . Someone must have broken in here and turned them off .
DETECTIVE HARRISON: My team just checked all the doors and there are no signs of forced entry . I 've also checked out the crime scene , but we did n't see any fingerprints on the glass . The suspect was probably wearing gloves .
MARK: That does n't sound good . How did they do it ?
RONNIE: Laser technology .
DETECTIVE HARRISON: My guess it was an inside job . Probably someone who has access to keys like a janitor or a security guard .
RONNIE: Detective Harrison , can I ask you how long you 've been a detective for ?
DETECTIVE HARRISON: I 'm almost at the end of my first year .
RONNIE: Just as I thought , a rookie .
DETECTIVE HARRISON: I 've been a police officer fo several years .
RONNIE: Yeah , you 're a rookie , okay . It 's fine , you 'll learn with experience . And when you do , you 'll discover that rule # 1 of law enforcement is that you do n't ever turn on a fellow officer . Now , I know you would neve actually accuse somebody on my Security Force of committing this act of lawlessness .
DETECTIVE HARRISON: Whoever did this would have to had keys to the Security Room so they could shut off the camera .
RONNIE: Look , my record speaks for itself and as for Dennis , well I can certainly vouch for him . Dennis is one of the finest men I know , so just take my word , you 're arking up the wrong tree . Now , let 's put this little squabble ehind us and get back to busting the guys that robbed this mall .
DETECTIVE HARRISON: Ronnie , nobody is accusing anybody , but I would like to stick around for a while and interview some of the employees .
MARK: Okay , but all I ask is that you do it quietly , so that the hoopla is kept to a minimum .
DETECTIVE HARRISON: I understand .
RONNIE: I understand too , sir .
MARK: Ronnie , you are to leave Detective Harrison alone and let him handle the investigation .
RONNIE: No can do , Mark . When you appointed me Head of Mall Security , I swore an oath to protect this mall and aid in inging crime to its knees .
MARK: You did n't swear an oath .
RONNIE: To myself I did .
DETECTIVE HARRISON: Ronnie , on these types of investigations , it 's usually not a good idea to have too many cooks in the kitchen .
RONNIE: There 's only one cook . I 'm a chef . A cook and chef , together , serving up justice .
DETECTIVE HARRISON: I 'm gon na do this alone .
RONNIE: Hot plates of justice .
DETECTIVE HARRISON: So , have you seen any suspicious people hanging around the mall ? Anybody who might have been casing the stores ?
SADDAMN: Nah , man . I ai n't seen nothing .
DETECTIVE HARRISON: Okay , well if you can think of anything , here 's my card .
RONNIE: My turn , Rookie .
DETECTIVE HARRISON: What are you doing , Ronnie ?
RONNIE: Solving the whole case right efore your eyes .
DETECTIVE HARRISON: Ronnie , this is official police usiness .
RONNIE: Hello , Saddamn .
SADDAMN: What the fuck you want , Ronnie ?
RONNIE: I want your ass to face the music is what I want .
SADDAMN: Do n't come any further , bitch . The restraining order says 20 feet so just back the fuck up .
DETECTIVE HARRISON: Ronnie , I appreciate you enthusiasm , but just let me handle this . Have a good day , sir .
RONNIE: So you 're just gon na let him slip ight through your fingers ?
DETECTIVE HARRISON: I have no reason to make him a suspect .
RONNIE: No reason ? Look at him . There 's every reason in the goddamn book .
SADDAMN: Why are you saying that , man ?
RONNIE: I think it 's obvious , Saddamn .
SADDAMN: That 's fucked up . You 're racist , man .
RONNIE: You 're not even black .
DETECTIVE HARRISON: Ronnie , stop . We 're finished here . Now if you 're going to tag along , I 'm gon na need you to just stay back ; are we clear ?
RONNIE: Sure , sorry . We 're crystal .
SADDAMN: What 's up , girl , you got a oyfriend ? Free cell phones with a month trial and I throw in my phone number for free .
DETECTIVE HARRISON: Did you let anybody borrow you keys ?
JANITOR: No , senor .
DETECTIVE HARRISON: Have you seen anything suspicious ?
JANITOR: No , senor .
DETECTIVE HARRISON: Okay , sir . Thank you for you time .
RONNIE: Alright , I believe I can be of some assistance here .
DETECTIVE HARRISON: Ronnie , we talked about this .
RONNIE: This is a special circumstance .
DETECTIVE HARRISON: What special circumstance ?
RONNIE: Communication skills , watch and learn .
JANITOR: Long drawn out conversation in Spanish ?
RONNIE: Como ?
JANITOR: More Spanish dialogue .
RONNIE: Si . Yeah , this guy definitely did it .
DETECTIVE HARRISON: What did he say ?
RONNIE: I do n't know , I do n't speak Spanish , but judging from his tonal inflections , it 's safe to say that he 's hiding something . The only question is where . Okay , Ramon , I 'm giving you one chance and one chance only to come clean . Or else Detective Harrison is going to come over to you house and deport your whole family ack to Mexico .
DETECTIVE HARRISON: No , I 'm not .
RONNIE: Good cop , bad cop , just play along . Where are you hiding the jewels ?
JANITOR: No se .
RONNIE: Alright , you 're gon na make me be the bad guy here ? Well , that 's a ole I 'm comfortable playing . Let 's just see what you 're hiding .
DETECTIVE HARRISON: Ronnie , that 's enough .
RONNIE: Think you 're pretty slick , do n't you ? Guess what ? I 'm pretty slick too .
HOT CLERK: Hello , can I help you ?
DETECTIVE HARRISON: I 'm Detective Harrison with the Cabarrus County Police .
RONNIE: And I 'm Ronnie Barnhardt , head of Mall Security .
DETECTIVE HARRISON: Okay , seriously , would you back the fuck off ? ! I 'm trying to do my job and you 're fucking it up .
RONNIE: Come on , we 're working here .
DETECTIVE HARRISON: I 'm working !
HOT CLERK: I 'm sorry , but I have n't noticed anything out of ordinary .
SEXY WORKER: Tracy , do you think my boyfriend would like these ?
DETECTIVE HARRISON: That 's fine , thanks for the help .
RONNIE: You 're gon na let them distract you with a little bit of panty showing . You have got a lot to learn , my friend . Who are you protecting , toots ?
HOT CLERK: What are you talking about ?
RONNIE: Look , I 'm sure you and your little friend have made a real lifestyle for yourselves here . It 's probably easy for you to blind most men with your beauty , but I 'm not most men . I can see through the sexuality to the truth . Jewelry , gold , diamonds , you do n't eally expect me to think that a man wants that crap . I 'm putting you on my list of top suspects . I do n't think you did the crime , but I do think you are an accomplice .
DETECTIVE HARRISON: I 'm sorry , ma'am . He 's not with me . Here 's my card . If you think of anything , just give me a call .
RONNIE: You should be ashamed of yourself .
DETECTIVE HARRISON: Shut up , Ronnie !
SALESMAN: It 's sage .
RONNIE: Whatever , hippy . If I find you doing drugs or killing cats o whatever you devil worshippers do , I 'll come back here and bust you . I swear to God .
DETECTIVE HARRISON: Get the hell out , Ronnie . I 'm here to ask questions about the obbery .
RONNIE: Just forget that , we 're on to something bigger here . ( back to the
SALESMAN: Tell me more about this 'sage . '
RONNIE: Now , maybe I 'm crazy or maybe I 'm the smartest man alive , but it seems kind of convenient to me that you sell hammers like this one that could easily be used to smash a glass case in , oh say , a jewelry store .
SEARS MANAGER: Could n't you smash the glass with anything ?
RONNIE: You really think you 're gon na talk your way out of this one ?
RONNIE: You guys should have been there today . We were just solving shit left and right . I mean , that 's what this job is supposed to be like . Busting loiterers and kids who steal pennies from the fountain has its rewards , but eally getting in there and closing cases is where it 's at . It 's rewarding too because at the end of the day , you know you 've done something good for the world .
BOUNCER: What are we doing here , Ronnie ? I thought you said they were giving away free Chick-fil-A sandwiches .
RONNIE: Well What is your name anyway ?
BOUNCER: Charles .
RONNIE: Well , my young apprentice . I called you here today because as Head of Mall Security , I have decided that it 's time to take protection to the next level . In other words , I alone can not combat this recent crime wave . In orde to help me in my personal journey , I have decided to divide up the tasks between my soldiers . So , for now on , Dennis , my right-hand man , you will be in charge of solving the case of who is robbing the mall . Little Chucky , you will e on the case of the Pervert . You are both to collect data and provide it to me . I will analyze the data , draw conclusions , and solve these crimes as well as coordinate and strategize with various law enforcement agencies .
BOUNCER: Since we 're going to be doing a lot of the work and you 're going to be solving the crimes , do we at least get paid ?
RONNIE: You ca n't measure honor in dollars and cents .
BOUNCER: Is that your girlfriend o something , Ronnie ?
RONNIE: Who me ? Nah , man . Why ? What do you think of her ?
BOUNCER: She 's not my type , but that 's just me .
RONNIE: Yeah , but , you do n't think she 's kind of hot ?
BOUNCER: Are you blind ? Give me a break . Wait , are you sure she 's not you girlfriend ?
RONNIE: Fuck no . There 's no way I 'd date that person who 's obviously not hot .
BOUNCER: You 're gon na hook me up with a job , right ?
RONNIE: Seven even . I promise .
RONNIE: One , two , three , TASK FORCE !
BRANDI: Sorry to interrupt .
RONNIE: It 's no interruption . What are you still doing here ?
BRANDI: I had to do inventory tonight . Bruce took off early so I 'm the last one . Hey , I was wondering if you would mind walking me to my car . You know , just in case that freak with the dick is out there someplace .
RONNIE: It would be my honor .
BRANDI: Alright , thanks for the ride .
RONNIE: Just doing my job with a little something extra especially fo you .
BRANDI: See ya tomorrow .
RONNIE: Brandi , um I was just thinking , would you like to go to dinne this weekend ?
BRANDI: How come every time somebody does something nice for me , they act like I owe them a blow job ?
RONNIE: Look , it 's not like that . I 've got a girlfriend who does n't work in this mall .
BRANDI: Ronnie , I got to be honest with you , you 're not really my type .
RONNIE: Just out of curiosity , what is your type ?
BRANDI: Rich guys . Or guys who are really hot .
RONNIE: Yeah , I guess that 's not me .
BRANDI: I 'll go out to dinner with you on one condition .
RONNIE: What 's that ?
BRANDI: This is not a date . Do you understand ? We 're going to dinner , but we are not going on a date .
RONNIE: Done .
BRANDI: And you can never tell anybody we went out .
RONNIE: My lips are sealed .
BRANDI: You pay for dinner , right ? And as many drinks as I want .
RONNIE: You may drink your fill .
BRANDI: And you have to drive me to my ca every night after work for the next six months .
RONNIE: You got it .
BRANDI: And my car is low on gas , so I need some money to fill it up .
RONNIE: Is $ 20 enough ?
BRANDI: Nah , fifty .
RONNIE: Got it . Not a date .
BRANDI: Thanks for the ride .
RONNIE: Hey , Brandi .
BRANDI: What ?
RONNIE: I lied . It is a date .
STEVIE: Our suspension is over .
RONNIE: I 'm not here for that . I need to talk to you .
BODYGUARD: Anything you want to say to Stevie , you can say to me , motherfucker !
RONNIE: Who the fuck are you ?
STEVIE: This is my cousin , Roy . He 's a oxer .
BODYGUARD: You got a fuckin ' problem , bitch ? !
STEVIE: Jesus , Ronnie , what the fuck are you doing ?
RONNIE: I need a favor .
STEVIE: I 'm listening .
RONNIE: As you know , we 've had a lot of crime around here lately . Between the Flasher and all the break-ins , I 've decided to go to the streets . Frankly , I 'm looking for a stool pigeon and you 're just the right person .
STEVIE: Why would I want to help you ?
RONNIE: I could make it worth your while . You like skating at the mall . I could allow you to skate here whenever you wanted . In exchange , you keep your eyes peeled and provide me with any information you come across as to the identity of the perpetrators .
STEVIE: Sorry , dude , but I 'm no snitch . Go find somebody else to do you dirty work .
RONNIE: Well , let me put it another way . If you do n't help me , I 'm gon na spread your little butt cheeks and stick this flashlight up your ass . But like for real . Like I really will do that . This is the new me talking and I get what I need , you understand me , Stevie ?
STEVIE: Alright , dude , I understand , you sick fuck .
RONNIE: Cool . In that case , have fun shreadin ' .
STEVIE: Stop crying , Roy .
NELL: Hey , sweetie Oh , I 'm sorry , good morning , Officer Barnhardt .
RONNIE: Good morning , Nell .
NELL: Where were you last night ? I tried to call , but your mom said you were n't home from work yet .
RONNIE: Look , I got to talk to you about something . I 'm not really sure how to put this . Let 's see . If you drove a Toyota .
NELL: I drive a Ford .
RONNIE: I know , but let 's just pretend you drove a Toyota . Now , this Toyota uns really good . It always starts when you need it to and it gets good gas mileage and you do n't have to do much to maintain it . Then you get a really important job like Astronaut , no that wo n't work , you get a job as the head of Wall Street . Well , you may really like that Toyota , ut you 're going to feel weird about driving it to work every day , right ? Now let 's say that somebody offers you a chance to get rid of that Toyota and instead you get a Ferrari . It may be more expensive and harder to drive , but I mean , it just looks good as hell . What would you do ?
NELL: I do n't get it .
RONNIE: You would trade up , Nell . Well , that 's exactly what I 'm doing .
NELL: Are you thinking about getting a new car ?
RONNIE: No , Nell , I 'm getting a new girlfriend .
NELL: What ? ! Who ?
RONNIE: This girl , Brandi .
NELL: The slutty girl who works at the make-up counter ?
RONNIE: Yeah , I mean , no , she 's not a slut . But you 're thinking of the ight person .
NELL: How could you do this to me ?
RONNIE: I 'm sorry . I do n't mean to hurt you . It 's just , well , I believe in this world , you play the hand you 're dealt and at this point in my life , I 've been dealt five Aces . I 'd be a fool not to bet .
NELL: Why are you doing this , Ronnie ?
RONNIE: I have to , Nell .
NELL: Do n't you love me ?
RONNIE: Of course I love you .
NELL: Then tell me why ?
RONNIE: Because I 've never dated the prom queen before .
NELL: Remember when you started this job ? You were n't such a hotshot then . I 've stood by you when you were at your worst . Every time you fell , I held your hand and told you everything would be okay . Time and time again .
RONNIE: Come on . Why do you have to bring that up ?
NELL: I never cared about who you wanted to be , I fell in love with who you eally are . If you leave me , Ronnie , I wo n't be there to pick you up when you fall .
RONNIE: Even if I do fall , it wo n't matter , because I 'm learning to fly .
SLICK SALESMAN: Can I help you , sir ?
RONNIE: Yeah , um , I 've got a really special date tonight with a hot young lady Do you know Brandi ?
SLICK SALESMAN: No .
RONNIE: Never mind . Anyway , I need something that 's really 'cool . ' Something that will impress he and I guess you could say I 'm not exactly in the know with what the hipsters are up to these days .
SLICK SALESMAN: Let 's see . Are you looking to fall in love or are you looking to get laid ?
RONNIE: Um , I guess love , but uh
SLICK SALESMAN: You want to get laid , too ?
RONNIE: Watch it , man . She 's a lady . But yes .
SLICK SALESMAN: Alright , I got just the thing . Something classy is what you want . Show her you 're a man with taste .
MOM: Come on , Ronnie , just get out here .
RONNIE: It 's too tight in the butt .
MOM: Let me see .
RONNIE: Really , you do n't think I look like a phony .
MOM: Hell no . You look like a stud muffin .
RONNIE: Yeah , I guess these clothes are kind of cool .
MOM: Nell is a lucky girl .
RONNIE: Its not Nell , Mom .
MOM: Really , I thought you and Nell were going to get married some day .
RONNIE: I did too . But then I met this girl Brandi and she swept me off my feet .
MOM: Well , I always liked Nell , but as long as you 're happy , Ronnie , that 's all I care about .
RONNIE: I actually feel kind of bad about Nell , but I figure that I can pou all the sadness into Brandi and just really rely on her for my happiness instead of Nell .
MOM: That sounds wonderful . Is she pretty ?
RONNIE: She is , Mom . She 's the most perfect girl in the whole world .
MOM: I remember when your father picked me up for our first date . I swea he was the most handsome man that I had ever laid eyes on . I knew ight then and there that this would be the man that I married .
RONNIE: I hope that happens tonight .
MOM: It will , Ronnie . Then you 'll have to give her a ring like the one your father gave me .
RONNIE: Is that a yellow diamond ?
MOM: It 's a glass diamond . This is how it looks now .
RONNIE: Mom , why did Dad leave ?
MOM: Well , he kind of freaked out when you were born . You had so many special needs that he just could n't handle the pressure . One day , he just could n't take it anymore .
RONNIE: Do you think it was my fault that Dad left ?
MOM: Definitely . You do n't think it was mine do you ?
RONNIE: Well , I did n't know , with the drinking and all .
MOM: Nope , it was all you .
RONNIE: I love you , too , Mom .
BRANDI: Yeah , work 's been pissing me off , so I just need to blow off some steam .
RONNIE: Well , Brandi , can I just say that you look absolutely beautiful tonight .
BRANDI: Yeah , I know . Nurse ! Get me another You got this , right ?
RONNIE: Yeah , yeah . No problem .
BRANDI: Nurse ! Bring me another and keep 'em coming . I think it 's funny to call the waitress nurse .
RONNIE: Oh , it 's nothing .
BRANDI: Do n't be stingy , what the fuck is that ?
RONNIE: It 's just a pill I 'm supposed to take .
BRANDI: Let me see .
RONNIE: The Doctor .

RONNIE: Yeah , I guess I party like this every four to six hours as needed .
BRANDI: Let me get one .
RONNIE: Help yourself .
BRANDI: Hell yeah !
RONNIE: So , how do you like working at the mall ?
BRANDI: I hate that shit . All I do is listen to bitching all day long . I got to put makeup on these fat- ass women all day and it 's like , I do n't give a shit what you do , you ca n't polish a turd .
RONNIE: Yeah , I see how that could get to you .
BRANDI: Let 's do some shots . Waiter , fou shots of Jager !
RONNIE: That 's a lot .
BRANDI: It 's Friday .
RONNIE: So , Brandi , I hope I 'm not being too forward , but do you have a oyfriend ?
BRANDI: I 've got a few hook-ups but nobody who is a boyfriend .
RONNIE: Yes !
BRANDI: You know , it 's just like a time in my life where I want to be free ight now and think about myself . Not get tied down to one person .
RONNIE: Yeah , I understand . I hate ties . I recently cut mine and now I 'm free like a bird .
BRANDI: Alright , bottoms up .
RONNIE: To new beginnings .
BRANDI: Right up your ass !
RONNIE: Okay .
BRANDI: Oh , shit !
RONNIE: No more . I 'm sticking to beer .
BRANDI: What 's wrong , is your pussy hurting ?
RONNIE: God , you remind me so much of my mother .
BRANDI: Feel the burn , bitch !
RONNIE: You are so beautiful .
BRANDI: Who wants to see my titties ? !
RONNIE: Brandi , this is the most fun I 've ever had on a date .
BRANDI: For the last time , this ai n't a date , motherfucker ! This is a party !
RONNIE: Wooo ! Um , so , Brandi , it 's no secret that I 'm attracted to you . I think everybody in the mall is . As you know , I recently split with my girlfriend and basically , I was wondering if , since you do n't have a boyfriend , that I could maybe be your boyfriend and you could be my girlfriend ?
BRANDI: That 's my house !
RONNIE: Brandi , I had a wonderful time tonight .
BRANDI: I 'm so fucking shit-faced .
RONNIE: Are you okay ?
BRANDI: My breath smells like asshole .
RONNIE: I love you , Brandi .
BRANDI: I think I 've got puke in my teeth .
RONNIE: I do n't care .
RONNIE: I 'm serious , Dennis . A gentleman never kisses and tells . So , just stop with all the pressure because it 's just not gon na happen .
NELL: Excuse me .
BRANDI: How may I help you ?
NELL: I need to talk to you .
BRANDI: What is it , honey ? Let me guess . You 're looking for something to take care of those blackheads and hide that puffiness under you eyes . I 've got just the thing .
NELL: No , that 's not it . Well , how much is it ?
BRANDI: Fifty dollars for the bottle .
NELL: Okay , I 'll take it .
BRANDI: What the hell are you talking about ?
NELL: It 's okay . I know he left me to e with you and I accept that .
BRANDI: I do n't know who you 've been talking to , but it 's safe to say that you 're fucking trippin ' .
NELL: It 's fine really . It 's going to take a while for me to get ove it , but I 'll be okay .
BRANDI: Oh fuckin ' Lord . This is disgusting .
NELL: I 'm sorry .
BRANDI: Pull it together . This is how you un around all the time ? Have some self-respect . No wonder you man left you . Who the hell would want to be around this shit all day ?
NELL: Jesus teaches us to forgive . And I forgive you for what you did to me when you stole my boyfriend . Plus , I feel pretty confident that you 'll end up burning in hell ecause of the various evil ways you live your life and that brings me some satisfaction . But I just want to tell you that Ronnie is a good person . He does a lot of stupid stuff , but really , he wants to do good for the world . I want you to know that if you hurt him and ruin his heart , I will personally come down here and kick the ever living shit out of you .
BRANDI: You better fuckin ' run , bitch !
NELL: It 's not too late to change you ways .
BRUCE: Okay . Thanks .
FLOWER SALESMAN: Ronnie , I 've been expecting you .
RONNIE: You have ?
FLOWER SALESMAN: Oh yeah , I heard about last night . Brandi is quite the woman . Congratulations , my friend . O should I say , welcome to the club ?
RONNIE: What color of roses do the women like anyway ?
FLOWER SALESMAN: Well , it depends on what you are trying to say . The white roses symbolize innocence and purity .
RONNIE: Yeah , we 're way past the colo white if you know what I mean . What about the yellow ones ?
FLOWER SALESMAN: Joy , happiness , appreciation .
RONNIE: I do n't even know what to make of that .
FLOWER SALESMAN: The pink rose means thank you .
RONNIE: Next .
FLOWER SALESMAN: The red rose is the most powerful . It symbolizes love .
RONNIE: Why did n't you just say that ? I 'm a busy man here .
FLOWER SALESMAN: I 'm sorry .
RONNIE: Forget it . Give me a big bag of the red ones .
FLOWER SALESMAN: Um , can I ask a question ?
RONNIE: Go ahead .
FLOWER SALESMAN: Do you really like Brandi ?
RONNIE: I 've only been on one date with her , but I could see myself being with her for all of eternity .
FLOWER SALESMAN: Well , in that case , the greatest symbol of love is just a single ed rose .
RONNIE: Seems like a big bag of roses would be more love than just one , ut I guess you 're the expert . Gim me one .
BRANDI: What are you doing here ?
RONNIE: I came here to see you . And to present you with this single red ose . It symbolizes 'love . '
BRANDI: Ronnie , that 's really uncalled for .
RONNIE: Well , after last night , I just wanted you to know that it was n't just some fling to me . It meant something special and I felt it deep in my soul .
BRUCE: You fucked the Security Guard ?
PLAYFUL: You are such a little slut !
BRANDI: Oh , like you 've never been drunk , Bruce !
RONNIE: I remember it for the both of us .
BRANDI: Okay , see here 's the thing . I do n't know how to say this , so I 'm just gon na come on out with it . Ronnie , I could never date you seriously . I mean , you 're a security guard .
RONNIE: I 'm the head of Mall Security .
BRANDI: Exactly . The point is , I do n't eally see myself being with that . Like ever . You know what I mean ?
RONNIE: Brandi , I know exactly what you mean . And I just want to thank you for being honest . You 're telling me I 'm not living up to my full potential in life . It 's funny , because I 've been feeling like this for quite some time . I guess I just needed that extra little push to get me over this hurdle I 've been stuck on . How can you be with a man who is n't living the life he was meant to ?
BRANDI: Yeah , something like that . And just you know , you 're a security guard at the mall and it 's like , come on , you know ?
RONNIE: I do n't like it , Brandi , but I do understand . I promise you this . Next time you see me , I will be wearing a uniform that will make you proud . I will be the man that you will be honored to call you life 's love .
BRANDI: Do n't bet on it .
RONNIE: I will though . I 'll bet everything I have on you . Now I ask you for one favor . Although I am unworthy , will you accept this ose from me anyway ?
BRANDI: I ca n't do that . And tell you girlfriend to stop coming by my work and threatening me and shit .
RONNIE: I 'm here to become a police officer .
POLICEMAN: We 're always on the hunt for new ecruits . Do you have at least a high school diploma ?
RONNIE: I have a GED .
POLICEMAN: We usually prefer an actual diploma , but GED is technically acceptable . Are you a citizen of the United States ?
RONNIE: You bet your ass I am .
POLICEMAN: Okay , Mr. Barnhardt , there are several steps you have to complete in order to be eligible for the police academy . Physical evaluation , psychological test , ackground check .
RONNIE: That sounds fun . Sign me up .
DETECTIVE HARRISON: You requested to ride along with me .
RONNIE: I know . You want to know the truth . It 's because I respect you . See , when we 're at the mall , it 's obviously my turf . Sure , I eak your balls about being a ookie , but out here in the streets , I 'm the rookie . I 'm here to learn . Teach me .
DETECTIVE HARRISON: Why do you want to become a Cop ?
RONNIE: I 've wanted to be a Police office all my life .
DETECTIVE HARRISON: Well , just pay attention tonight and make sure you stay out of the way .
RONNIE: Right , we 're not back at the station anymore so we can cut the charade .
DETECTIVE HARRISON: What are you talking about ?
RONNIE: Well , I know that policy demands I stay out of the way , but between you and me , I just want you to know that if anything pops off tonight , I 'm going to jump right in there and take 'em down with you .
DETECTIVE HARRISON: No , no . Ronnie , policy says you have to stay in the car .
RONNIE: I get you . You have to say this in order to keep you safe 'legally ' speaking . I should probably follow along too . ' I swear I wo n't get out of the ca and fight justice tonight . '
DETECTIVE HARRISON: Ronnie , you really ca n't .
RONNIE: I know .
DETECTIVE HARRISON: I 'm glad we understand each other .
RONNIE: Yeah , so then I basically saw his ass trying to circumvent around the ped exit and slip through the employ exit . Not allowed . The two ped exits are to be used only
DETECTIVE HARRISON: You see that corner there , Ronnie ?
RONNIE: Yeah , I see it .
DETECTIVE HARRISON: That corner used to be the worst corner in this whole town . It was iddled with drugs , prostitution , and gang violence . It was nicknamed 'The Crossroads . '
RONNIE: Shit , I 've heard of that .
DETECTIVE HARRISON: That 's right , but myself and the other officers worked on cleaning it up for years so that the good folks of this neighborhood would n't have to worry about being safe . Yes , sir , that corner is a testament to the fine police work of our force .
RONNIE: I do n't know . It looks pretty shitty to me .
DETECTIVE HARRISON: Well , it 's a low income area , Ronnie . You 're being kind of prejudiced .
RONNIE: Oh , yeah , I can see that it 's asically a fine neighborhood .
DETECTIVE HARRISON: That 's right , but it has n't been easy . We still patrol this area every night just to keep ou presence up .
RONNIE: I use that same technique at the mall .
DETECTIVE HARRISON: I 'm sure . I usually do the foot patrols myself , but because I like you , I 'm going to let you do it tonight .
RONNIE: Really ?
DETECTIVE HARRISON: Yeah , really . But I told you about department policy , so I 'm going to need you to keep quiet about this one .
RONNIE: You can count on me . Thank you for the honor .
DETECTIVE HARRISON: Of course , Ronnie . I just really elieve in you .
RONNIE: I wo n't let you down .
RONNIE: Where are you going ? !
KID: You want some crack ?
RONNIE: No , I do n't want any crack . In fact , I did n't want to do this , ut you leave me no choice in the matter . I 'm placing you unde citizen 's arrest .
KID: Let me go , motherfucker !
RONNIE: I place you under citizen 's arrest for the crime of selling a Schedule 1 Narcotic . You have the ight to remain silent
RONNIE: If you can not afford an attorney , one will be appointed to you . Now I guess we just wait here for my ride to come back .
RONNIE: Oh , no . That 's really not necessary , Tone .
COP #1: I ca n't believe you dropped him off at the Crossroads . That 's fucking hilarious .
DETECTIVE HARRISON: Trust me , you would have done the same thing . This guy is without a doubt the biggest fucking idiot I have ever met .
COP #1: He 's probably going to get killed .
DETECTIVE HARRISON: Good ! Fuck him , I hope he does get killed .
RONNIE: I know what you did !
DETECTIVE HARRISON: Ronnie , look , I did n't do anything
RONNIE: You 're not going to talk your way out of this one . You set me up !
DETECTIVE HARRISON: Ronnie , look
RONNIE: Do n't try to deny it ! You set me up and that 's all there is to it .
DETECTIVE HARRISON: Ronnie , I
RONNIE: And I just want to thank you fo it .
DETECTIVE HARRISON: Thank me ? Why ?
RONNIE: Because I 'm proud to report that I passed the test . I know you wanted to see if I had the chops to cut it on the police force and I 'm glad to say that I passed . I knew I would get initiated some time , but I did n't think it would e so soon . Thank you , Detective Harrison . Thank you for believing in me .
DETECTIVE HARRISON: Ronnie , I do n't know what to say .
RONNIE: You do n't have to say anything . Your actions speak for themselves . Thank you for giving this rookie a shot . Get used to seeing Ronnie Barnhardt around here , boys .
MARK: Come in .
RONNIE: Good morning , Mark .
MARK: Is it , Ronnie ? I mean , the mall is getting butchered in the press . Somebody who works here is ripping the place off . The cops do n't have any leads . I 'm getting shit from the owner of the mall . Sales are down . I mean , what 's so good about this morning ?
RONNIE: I feel your pain , Mark . Quite frankly , there 's two things happening . One , I 'm lacking a sufficient firearm . And two , we 're understaffed . That 's why I come to you this morning with a plan . Come on in , Charles .
MARK: Who is this ?
RONNIE: This is Charles , sir .
CHARLES: How 's it going ?
MARK: You work at O'Charley 's , right .
CHARLES: That 's right .
RONNIE: Mark , I would like to hire Charles here as an additional Security Guard . He would operate under me . I figure with the additional criminal element , we should hire more security in hopes that we would have a better chance of catching these guys .
MARK: Do you have any experience , son ?
CHARLES: Not really .
RONNIE: Um , sir , I have personally been training young Charles for weeks now in preparation for this day . The kid kind of looks up to me . I 'm some what of a big brother to the little guy .
MARK: Alright , it 's actually not a bad idea . It might make our Security more visible so we can give people the illusion that we 're on top of this .
CHARLES: Thank you , Mark .
MARK: Ronnie , one more thing . Look , if this crime does n't come to an end pretty soon , we 're gon na have to let someone go . I mean , you 've always done a great job for me , ut the truth is , someone is going to have to take the fall . You 're the one who wanted to be Head of Mall Security and quite frankly , I just bought my wife a new Cadillac , so let 's just say it wo n't be me .
RONNIE: With Charles on my team , I can now devote more time to the robbery and Pervert case . I plan on having these wrapped up by the end of the week .
MARK: It 's nothing . Have fun , Ronnie .
RONNIE: Did I say something funny ?
CHARLES: Let 's go , Ronnie .
RONNIE: That 's not bad , but you need to learn to speak in a more authoritative voice . Watch this . Slow it down ! Slow it down ! You 've already received one verbal , do n't make me issue a second ! See , you ca n't be intimidated . You have to make them respect you .
CHARLES: Ronnie , you know I really want to thank you for the job . You 're a man of your word .
RONNIE: No problem , my young student . So , I got something to tell you . Keep this between us until it 's official , but I do n't think I 'm going to be here for much longer .
CHARLES: You 're quitting ? But you love this job .
RONNIE: I do love it , but it looks like someone is going to be joining the police force .
CHARLES: The real police ?
RONNIE: They 're calling me up . It 's asically a done deal . Just a little red tape is the only thing keeping me from carrying a gun .
CHARLES: I did n't even know you wanted to ecome a Cop .
RONNIE: It 's always been my job . The Mall thing is great training , but it has its limitations . Some stars are just meant to shine brighte than others .
CHARLES: Congrats , brother .
NELL: Hey , Ronnie .
RONNIE: What are you doing ?
NELL: Nothing , just getting in shape .
RONNIE: Well , that 's okay , I guess . Just watch your speed , okay ?
CHARLES: Is n't that your girlfriend ?
RONNIE: Ex .
CHARLES: She looked good .
RONNIE: You think so ?
CHARLES: She looks a lot better .
RONNIE: Yeah .
PSYCHOLOGIST: Okay , Ronnie , today I 'll be giving you a psychiatric evaluation to determine if you 're competent to enter into the Police Academy . It 's really just a formality . Do n't want any serial killers working for us , now do we ?
RONNIE: No , ma'am , we do n't .
PSYCHOLOGIST: Okay , Ronnie , so let 's start with your background . Where are you from ?
RONNIE: Born and raised right here .
PSYCHOLOGIST: Local boy . Okay , and , Ronnie , have you ever been convicted of any crimes ?
RONNIE: No , ma'am . My record is totally clean .
PSYCHOLOGIST: Do you now take any illegal drugs or have you taken any in the past ?
RONNIE: No , ma'am . I believe drugs are the path to self-destruction and should be purged from the face of the earth with ruthless vengeance .
PSYCHOLOGIST: Any prescription medications ?
RONNIE: Yes , for my nerves . A man in my line of work has a lot of stress to deal with . If you 've seen the loodshed I 've seen , you 'd be on the meds too . I Where are you going with this ?
PSYCHOLOGIST: Are you presently or have you eve een affiliated with the Communist Party ?
RONNIE: I ca n't believe you 'd even ask me that .
PSYCHOLOGIST: Have you ever been in the military ?
RONNIE: Yes .
PSYCHOLOGIST: What branch of the military were you in ?
RONNIE: The kind of branch that does n't exist on paper .
PSYCHOLOGIST: Okay , here 's a real world scenario . You have a gun
RONNIE: Finally .
PSYCHOLOGIST: That was n't really the question , never mind , I think I got that one . Um here 's one . Do you feel like you would work well on a team ?
RONNIE: Would I ? Yes . Would I be more useful working alone , I would say definitely . I see myself more like a Rambo kind of guy . A man who rolls solo . Taking care of usiness on his own terms . Kind of like a Superhero or something .
PSYCHOLOGIST: Why do you want to become a cop ?
RONNIE: I want to become a cop to help people . The world is a scary place with lots of evil everywhere . See , I have this vision of evil trying to get at the world from every angle and there I stand at the top of it all with my gun , just kind of blowing it away . Just me and my weapons , cleaning up this whole town . I know I could do some good if I was just given a chance and everybody would be a lot better off .
PSYCHOLOGIST: Uh-huh . So , what do you feel is the greatest danger facing a police officer today ?
RONNIE: Maybe Russian gang activity , but you know what ? I think I 'm gon na have to go with evil on that one too .
PSYCHOLOGIST: Okay , I think we 're good here . It 's been a pleasure , Ronnie .
RONNIE: Thank you , ma'am .
MOM: I do n't care about that bullshit . All I need is a little nip of this good shit right here and I 'm ready to walk through the pearly gates .
RONNIE: Mom , I know , but maybe you should stop drinking so much . You 're getting up there and you know what the doctor said about your liver .
MOM: I do n't tell you how to party , do n't tell me how to live my life . I 've taken care of you since you were born .
RONNIE: I just worry about you is all .
MOM: Ronnie , do n't get your hopes up about this police thing .
RONNIE: Why would you say that ?
MOM: You know why . I just do n't want to see you get hurt . It 's my jo to protect you from the bullshit .
RONNIE: Mom , I appreciate it , but I 'm going to make it as a police officer . I 'm tired of coming in second all the time . Everybody in life gets to go for their goals , why should I be any different ?
MOM: I know . Just be careful is all . You 've got a good heart and I do n't want to see it broken .
RONNIE: Okay , Mom . I hear you .
MOM: And , Ronnie , one more thing .
RONNIE: What 's that , Mom ?
MOM: That 's right ! Now you got to smell it !
RONNIE: Mom .
RONNIE: Ronnie Barnhardt reporting fo duty .
DETECTIVE HARRISON: I can see that . Listen , I do n't eally know how to say this , but we 're not going to be able to let you join the academy .
RONNIE: What ? ! Why not ?
DETECTIVE HARRISON: It seems you had a little trouble passing the minimum requirements .
RONNIE: Did I fail one of the tests ?
DETECTIVE HARRISON: Well , yes , actually , you failed the psychological exam .
RONNIE: No !
DETECTIVE HARRISON: It says That Ronnie Barnhardt shows warning signs of delusion and allowing him to join the force puts his life and the lives of others in jeopardy .
RONNIE: Detective Harrison , you 've got to elieve me . I 'm completely sound . This has got to be a mistake .
DETECTIVE HARRISON: Ronnie , I personally did you ackground check and this is the fifth time you 've been turned down for the police academy .
RONNIE: You guys keep records on that ?
DETECTIVE HARRISON: We sure do . Look , I tried to talk to them , but there 's no way they 're gon na let you in . I 'm sorry , but your dreams of becoming a Police Officer just are n't going to happen .
RONNIE: I understand . Thanks fo elieving in me , Detective . And just for the record , I 'm not crazy .
DETECTIVE HARRISON: Take care , Ronnie .
RONNIE: Hey , Nell .
NELL: Hey , Ronnie . How 's it going ?
RONNIE: Can I talk to you for a second ?
NELL: What is it ?
RONNIE: I tried to get into the police academy again and the same thing happened .
NELL: Oh , Ronnie , I 'm sorry .
RONNIE: Why does this keep happening to me , Nell ?
NELL: I do n't know , Ronnie . Maybe it 's just not meant to be . Are you okay ?
RONNIE: No . Are you going home ? I mean , do you want to go somewhere and talk or something ?
NELL: Ronnie , I ca n't .
RONNIE: Why not ?
NELL: I 've got plans .
RONNIE: What plans ?
SADDAMN: Look at this sorry piece of shit .
RONNIE: What the fuck do you want ?
SADDAMN: I do n't want anything from you . How you doing , sweetness ?
RONNIE: What the fuck is going on ?
SADDAMN: You ready to go ? We got eservations at 9 00 .
NELL: I 'm ready , Saddamn .
RONNIE: Nell , for the love of God , do n't go with him .
NELL: I 'm sorry , Ronnie .
RONNIE: Do n't go , Nell . Remember you purity ! Remember your purity !
STEVIE: What are you doing , Ronnie ?
RONNIE: I 'm just taking a break . What do you want , Stevie ? I do n't have time to fuck around with you today .
STEVIE: I got something .
RONNIE: What the fuck is this ?
DUDE: Dude , I found these all over the mall . I 'm guessing that whoeve this Mall Flasher is , left these for girls to find .
RONNIE: This thing gets grosser and grosser all the time . Well , thanks for the clue . Maybe I can use this to identify the freak . You can skate all you want around here .
STEVIE: What 's wrong with you , Ronnie ?
RONNIE: What do you mean ?
STEVIE: I do n't know . You just seem kind of sad .
RONNIE: Nah , man , I 'm fine . I mean , I 'm catchin ' perverts and protecting this mall and just you know , eally livin ' the dream .
STEVIE: That 's cool . Look , man , you want to get high ?
RONNIE: No , I do n't want to get high .
STEVIE: That 's cool .
RONNIE: And by the way , if I see you getting high , I will call the police and have your criminal ass arrested . Do n't you fuckin ' eve mistake my kindness for weakness . I hate drugs and I hate you too .
STEVIE: Fine , you fucking dick .
BRANDI: Shhhh .

DETECTIVE HARRISON: No , I guess not .
BRANDI: Fine .
RONNIE: I 'm disbanding the task force .
CHARLES: Hey , Ronnie , that 's crazy talk . Are you cool ?
RONNIE: No , I 'm not cool , Charles . In fact , shit is seriously fucked up . I 've got to protect the whole mall y myself . Now , I got you this fucking job , when are you going to stop being a little baby and do something for a change .

CHARLES: I 'm gon na go check the parking lot .
RONNIE: I 'm sorry , Charles ! I did n't mean it , buddy !
DENNIS: I 've been waiting on you to get on my page this whole time . You look at this mall as a Kingdom ? ! Shit ! I look at this place like a motherfucking jail sentence . You put on that uniform every morning , ut what are you really protecting ? Commerce and corporations and money . Well I say , fuck that ! I 'm a fucking outlaw and I 'm going to live that until the day I die . Now , I can show you the way , but you 've got to be willing to accept it . So I 'm gon na ask you now , Ronnie . Are you ready for a trip to the other side ?
RONNIE: You 're goddamn right I 'm ready .
DENNIS: Alright then . Let 's party .
RONNIE: Fuck it , give me the bottle .

DENNIS: Do n't mention it , homey . I 'm just glad I got me a partner in crime .
RONNIE: A partner . I like that . You know , I 've never really had a friend before , but I think that this could be the beginning of a eal good thing .
DENNIS: You ai n't even seen the best part . After everybody leaves , I rob the shit out of this place .
RONNIE: What do you mean ?
DENNIS: I steal shit !

DENNIS: Hell yeah ! Who 'd you think it was ? !
RONNIE: I ca n't believe this . Right in front of my goddamn face this whole time !
DENNIS: This probably will look good with my complexion .
RONNIE: Dennis , I ca n't take part in this .
DENNIS: Ronnie , I thought you were down ? ! What the fuck ? ! Here I am opening up myself to you and you 're just gon na stick it to me like this . What the fuck has this place eve done for you ? Do n't you know that people see us as jokes ? ! A useless tool that 's left in the shed . Well that 's not me . Not now , not ever . I told you , I 'm an outlaw .
RONNIE: I ca n't let you rob the mall .

RONNIE: Come on , Dennis . We 're best friends , so just put that stuff ack and let 's go get a beer .
DENNIS: Alright , Ronnie , you 're right .
RONNIE: Good , man . That makes me feel etter .
DENNIS: See ya in Mexico , bitch .
RONNIE: Ramon , get your ass over here ! Go get my spare keys out of the office .
MARK: How fucking stupid do you have to e ? ! I mean Dennis . What the fuck , Ronnie ? How could you not have known it was Dennis ? Then , how the fuck could you be so stupid as to let him get away . OBSERVE AND REPORT . Those are the only two things you have to do and you ca n't do those worth a shit .
RONNIE: Can I speak now ?
MARK: Go ahead .
RONNIE: Are you sure ?
MARK: Just start talking , Ronnie !
RONNIE: It seems only natural that 'some people ' would want to blame me and truth be told I do put a lot of that blame on myself . But some people might say that the cops are to blame for not catching them . Some people might say that the eason this happened was the undeniable fact that I was under- equipped and quite frankly , lacking a sufficient firearm . But not me . I carry this loss alone deep inside my heart .
MARK: Good . Because you 're fired .
RONNIE: Fuck you .
MARK: I 'm serious , Ronnie . I 've always liked you , but there 's just no excuse for this . Somebody is going down and I 'll be damned if it 's going to be me . Now , do n't make a big thing out of this . Just pack your shit and get out by the end of the day .
RONNIE: Wait a minute . I thought I could trust you , Mark , and now you 're telling me that you 're going to be the one to put the knife in my ack . Fair weather friend you are .
MARK: I 'm not your friend , I 'm you oss .
RONNIE: You think you 're so smart , Mark . You do n't know everything . If you 're firing me , then you can say goodbye to your entire Security staff . Because there is no fucking way my team is going to work here if you fire me . Is n't that right , Charles ?
CHARLES: Ronnie , I got to talk to you about this . Mark asked me down here to escort you out .
RONNIE: And you told him to fuck off , ight ? Charles ? Right ?
CHARLES: What the fuck do you want from me , Ronnie ?
RONNIE: This is n't happening ! Everybody is fucking me over ? ! I hate you all .
CHARLES: I 'm sorry , Ronnie , but it 's time to go .
RONNIE: Wait a minute . I 'll work fo free , Mark .
MARK: No , Ronnie .
RONNIE: I 'll pay you .
MARK: Nope .
RONNIE: I love you .
MARK: Ronnie , Jesus have a little self- espect .
RONNIE: You do n't love me , Mark ?
MARK: Ronnie , it 's over .
RONNIE: Hey , Charles . Mark asked you down here in case I got out of hand ? Well , get ready to earn you money .
MARK: Stop him !
CHARLES: Alright , Ronnie , that 's enough .
MOM: What 's on the agenda for today ?
RONNIE: I guess maybe look for a job o something .
MOM: Well , I know you 're sad about it , ut try to look on the bright side .
RONNIE: There is no bright side . My life is over .
MOM: Ronnie , you may not be smart o handsome , but you 've got dreams inside of you and dreams make you special . No matter what this world tries to throw at you , they can never take those dreams away .
RONNIE: What the fuck are you talking about , Mom ?
MOM: I do n't know . I 'm drunk . I just know that mothers are supposed to talk like that to their children when they 're sad , so I tried . What do you want from me ?
RONNIE: Nothing . That 's exactly what you 're supposed to do . I just lew my life . I tried to be a big shot , a hero and a stupid cop . I wanted to be recognized for being great . I should have just been happy where I was at . I did n't do my duty .
MOM: Ronnie , the other night when I soiled my pants right before I puked myself , I was thinking about how you would come home and find me and clean me up . I knew you would be there to find me and take care of me , so I was able to pass out on the floor and not worry . If there 's one thing you know about , it 's duty .
RONNIE: I do it because I love you .
MOM: I know and I love you too , Ronnie . I have n't always been easy to deal with and most people would have thrown me away a long time ago .
RONNIE: Are you going to quit drinking ?
MOM: I 'm switching to beer . I can pound those all day and still keep my shit together . I 'm doing it for you .
RONNIE: I 'm so proud of you , Mom .
MOM: I 'm proud of you . Now today is a new day and we 're going to get through it . Now , get out there and find what the world has in store for you .
DENNIS: What 's up , Ronnie ? How you doing ?
RONNIE: I 've been better . You ?
DENNIS: I 'm holding it down in here .
RONNIE: Yeah , I heard they finally caught up with you .
DENNIS: I know . I should have hit Mexico , ut , you know , I got stoned and just kind of kicked with this girl in Kannapolis for a while .
RONNIE: You know they fired me when they found out you were the one who obbed the mall .
DENNIS: Shit , dog . Sorry about that .
RONNIE: It 's cool , but I need to know why you did it .
DENNIS: I told you . I 'm an outlaw .
RONNIE: Come on , Dennis .
DENNIS: Man , you want to know the real eason ?
RONNIE: Yeah .
DENNIS: Alright , I 'll tell you . Man , that gig was one of the best jobs I ever had . I got to wear a uniform , I could smoke weed whenever I wanted . For once in my life , I felt like I was actually somebody . I know most people do n't think it 's shit , but I eally loved it . Then , all of a sudden , I find out that your ass got promoted over me .
RONNIE: What 's that ?
DENNIS: You ever love a girl so much that you ca n't break up with her , so the only thing you can do when she pisses you off is smack her in the goddamn face ?
RONNIE: No , Dennis , I have n't .
DENNIS: Well , I have . And that 's pretty much how I felt about the job .
RONNIE: Thanks for talking to me , Dennis .
DENNIS: Well , it 's the least I could do after knocking you out and all .
RONNIE: Yeah , Dennis .
DENNIS: Bail me out of here , old friend .
RONNIE: I ca n't do it , Dennis . You 're now a criminal who stopped caring , but my crime is that I care too much .
CHARLES: Ronnie , what are you doing back here ?
RONNIE: I just came to talk to Nell . Do n't get your panties in a wad , I 'm just here as any normal patron .
CHARLES: Ronnie , dude , I 've been all fucked up in the head . I feel like shit about what happened . I mean , here I am , just looking to shuck esponsibility and I ended up hurting you in the process . Look , I should have been honest with you . I do n't give two shits about this stupid job . But you do .
RONNIE: It 's okay , Charles .
CHARLES: I 've decided I 'm going back to college . Getting stoned and studying beats this any day . I ealize that now . I realize that there are n't any jobs where you can avoid hard choices . Anyway , take as long as you want at the mall . I 'll keep Mark off you ack .
RONNIE: Thanks , Charles .
NELL: Ronnie , what are you doing here ?
RONNIE: I got something I want to say .
NELL: I do n't think we should be talking .
RONNIE: I 'll be quick . Nell , this is the only job I was ever any good at . I 'm not a crime solver or right hand of the law . I 'm just a dum guy in a uniform who ca n't even ecome a real policeman . Somewhere along the way I started to think I was something special , someone whose shit did n't stink , someone who deserved to date out of my league . You know , I 've learned . My shit does stink . It smells horrible . And you 're also out of my league , but for some eason , you like the smell of my shit . I guess what I 'm saying is
NELL: Oh , my God !
RONNIE: Are you alright ?
NELL: I 'm fine .
RONNIE: Shit , we should call somebody .
NELL: Ronnie .
RONNIE: Yeah ?
NELL: Go get him .
SADDAMN: What the fuck , man ? !

STEVIE: Dude , that 's fucking disgusting !
RONNIE: Okay , Ramon , we 're fucking even !
MARK: Okay , show 's over . Enjoy you shopping experience at Carolina Mall .
CHARLES: What is it ?
MARK: Call the police . And go get Ronnie .
CHARLES: He 's trying to help .
MARK: Just do what I ask you .
CHARLES: Hey , Ronnie !
RONNIE: Fuck yeah !
CHARLES: You want to report this to the police .
RONNIE: Hell no . I 'm taking him down myself .
MARK: Hey , Ronnie .
RONNIE: Thank you , sir .
BRANDI: Good job , Ronnie .
RONNIE: I do n't love you !
BRANDI: I do n't love you either .
RONNIE: Fine .
DETECTIVE HARRISON: I see that . Well , you better turn him over to me and I 'll take him inside and book him .
RONNIE: Since you 're a real Cop , right ?
DETECTIVE HARRISON: Hey , Ronnie , you may not be an officer of the law , but you 're the law 's right hand . Good job .
RONNIE: What are you doing ? !
NELL: You had an eyelash ?
RONNIE: I 'm trying to remember my speech .
NELL: Sorry .
FEMALE REPORTER: Okay , Ronnie , we 're ready for you .
CAMERAMAN: Rolling .
FEMALE REPORTER: Good evening . We 're here today with Ronnie Barnhardt , head of Mall Security here at Carolina Mall . Last week , Ronnie was able to catch The CAROLINA MALL FLASHER single-handed and bring him to justice . Ronnie , how did you manage to find the identity of The Pervert and take him down ?
RONNIE: Well , being a mall security guard asically requires the same skill set that someone in say the FBI has . You have to use logic and evidence and old-fashioned common sense as well as the latest technology to deduce the criminal mind . It 's what I do .
FEMALE REPORTER: Any last words for the folks at home .
RONNIE: Yeah , I 'd just like to say that Carolina Mall is back on track and safer than ever
FEMALE REPORTER: You heard it , folks . Everything is back to normal here at Carolina Mall . Back to you , Lindsay .

BETH'S VOICE: Do you want people to think we put it up ?
DEREK'S VOICE: I do n't know . I kind of like it .
BETH'S VOICE: Please tell me you 're joking .
DEREK: All I 'm saying , before we take it down maybe we should try it out .
PLAYFUL: You know . Christen the new house .
BETH: And what do you suggest we use for a bed ?
DEREK: What do we need a bed for when we 've got a fine shag carpet ?
BETH: Because I 'm gon na have fine shag carpet tattoos all over my
DEREK: Told ` em I 'd be late .
BETH: What about
DEREK: Kyle ? That boy would n't wake up if a nuclear bomb went off .
BETH: Maybe not , but the movers
DEREK: Wo n't be here for another hour .
BETH: Derek , you are so bad .
DEREK: Is n't THAT why you married me ?
DEREK: Want me to stay ? Crack the whip on these guys ?
BETH: No . Go to work and earn that promotion . Somebody 's got to pay for all this .
ISA: Gage/Bendix ?
DEREK: Excuse me ?
LISA: I could n't help but notice we 're both going to Seven .
DEREK: Right . Gage/Bendix . I work there .
LISA: I thought you might .
DEREK: Do you have an appointment with us ?
LISA: Why ? Do I look like a client ?
DEREK: Actually , you do .
DEREK: You 're a temp ?
LISA: Just here for the day .
DEREK: Well , you could have fooled me .
LISA: I 'm beginning to think these heels were a ig mistake .
DEREK: No problem . Happen to anybody .
ISA: Thanks . I owe you one .
DEREK: Are you following me ?
LISA: No . I 'm taking these files to Miste Charles ' office . They said it was this way .
DEREK: Derek Charles ?
LISA: I guess you probably know him .
DEREK: Oh , yeah , I know him . Kind of an asshole , takes himself waaaay too seriously . But do n't tell him I said that . L
ISA: I could get you into trouble ?

AGE: Did you talk to our German friend , He Ganz ?
DEREK: Matter of fact , I just got off the line to Berlin .
GAGE: And ?
DEREK: Ganz does n't like the way the Stock Market 's been gyrating and he thinks the hedge fund wave is about to crest .
AGE: You think he 's right ?
DEREK: Hell , no . I think he 's a hundred percent wrong . We have n't even gotten close to that point yet . Hedge fund demand is coming from individual investors which is why it 's gaining mainstream acceptance . You know Ganz . He gets paranoid when anything goes mainstream . He started making Auf Wiedersehen noises but I managed to talk him into a private equity portfolio instead to the tune of 155 mil .
AGE: I knew there was a reason I promoted you . No offense , Ben .
BEN: None taken , Joe . I 'm just honored to be allowed to exist in Derek 's world .
GAGE: Good . I want you to throw Derek all you support on this one .
BEN: Never seen ` em before .
DEREK: I think she 's one of the temps .
BEN: You mean temptress
GAGE: Remind me to call that agency and have them send over a couple more just like her . Does n't hurt to have a little eye candy around the office , does it , boys ?
BEN: I scored an extra Lakers ticket fo tomorrow night . Think you can get free ?
DEREK: I 'm moving into a new house .
EN: So ?
DEREK: Do I look like a man who wants a divorce ?
EN: I could call and say it 's a work emergency .
DEREK: Thanks , but I think I 'll stay married instead .
BEN: Coward .
LISA: Good night , Mister Charles .
DEREK: Sorry but you set me up .
LISA: Do n't worry . I 'll get my revenge . And y the way , you might like to know everybody who works here strongly disagrees with you .
DEREK: About what ?
LISA: About Derek Charles being an asshole . They all say he 's the nicest guy in the firm .
DEREK: Well , that just proves he 's got ` em all fooled .
LISA: And he 's humble , too . I 'm Lisa , by the way . Lisa Sheridan .
DEREK: Well , it was nice to meet you , Lisa Sheridan . Good luck with your next job

DEREK: Beth , you are so bad .
BETH: Is n't that WHY you married ME ?
LISA: Hi . Remember me ?
DEREK: Lisa Sheridan , Girl Temp . Where 's Patrick ?
LISA: Out with the flu . I did some trading with the other temps and wrangled you desk . I hope that 's okay .
MARGE: Good morning , Derek .
DEREK: Grab your pad and follow me .
LISA: I put a memo on your desk about the Christmas party this Friday .
EREK: Is it that time already ?
LISA: Why do n't they invite spouses ?
DEREK: How 's that ?
LISA: To the Christmas party . It says `` fo employees only . ''
DEREK: It 's like that in most companies . They think people are more inhibited in front of their spouses , less likely to kick ack and enjoy themselves and mingle with co-workers , which is what the party is about .
LISA: So , does this party get pretty wild ?
DEREK: Just the opposite .
LISA: Well that 's no fun .
DEREK: No , it 's perfect .
LISA: Fire away .
DEREK: Well , it 's Monday and first thing on Monday
LISA: I took care of that .

DEREK: Well , it took a little more than roses . We need to run some calls .
LISA: Ready when you are .

LISA: I think you 'll find I 'm not your typical temp .
DEREK: No . Definitely not .
THEN: Okay not your typical temp start with Phil Trendle at Emerson set up a lunch for end of the week . Wherever he wants ut push the Water Grill . Then Terry Mills at Imagio . Am I going too fast fo you ?
LISA: No . Go faster . I can handle it .
BETH: It 's a beautiful little park with a duck pond and close enough to push Kyle .
DEREK: I do n't know . It 's shaping up to be a work weekend .
BETH: You can work at home and then we 'll go to the barbecue .
LISA: Do you need me ?
BETH: Work at the office . This is home . Come to bed .
DEREK: In a sec .
BETH: The card that came today with the oses
EREK: Uh huh ?
BETH: was addressed `` To Betty . ''
EREK: Betty ?
BETH: Your other wife ? Yeah . Who 's Betty ?
DEREK: Blame it on the new girl . Patrick called in sick and I had a temp on my desk .

DEREK: I 'd love to but I 'm all jammed up . But say hi to your sister .
BETH: That guy she was seeing , the one we met at Thanksgiving Jack .
BETH: Apparently he 's not so perfect . He told her he just wants to be FWB .
DEREK: FWB ?
BETH: Friends With Benefits .
DEREK: What does that mean ?
BETH: You know . Sex but no commitments .
DEREK: And Sheila 's got a problem with that ?
LISA: Excuse me .
DEREK: Lisa , this is my wife Beth . Beth , Lisa . She 's temping for Patrick .
BETH: Hi .
LISA: It 's great to meet you , Mrs. Charles . eyes lighting up ) And this must be Kyle . I can already tell he 's going to grow up to be a heartbreaker .
DEREK: Kyle , say hello .
BETH: He can say hello . He 's usually not this shy around strangers .
LISA: What a handsome boy . He looks just like you .
DEREK: Actually , most people think he takes after Beth .
LISA: Talk about the perfect family . The three of you should be on a magazine cover .
BETH: I hope my husband 's not working you too hard .
LISA: He is . But I like it . I 'm learning a lot . Joe Gage needs to see you when you get a minute .

BETH: I thought you said she was plain . Derek , that girl may be a lot of things but one of them is not plain .
DEREK: How would I know ? I only have eyes fo you . B
ETH: Oh , you are so slick .
DEREK: Come on . I 'll walk you to the elevator . You can say hi to the old gang .
BEAT: Ever miss it ?
BETH: I like to think I traded up .
EREK: Hey , Patrick . Feeling better ?
PATRICK: Much . Thanks .

EREK: You get around do n't you ?
PATRICK: Yeah She 's not speaking to me at the moment .
DEREK: Alright . You two behave yourselves out here
PATRICK: So , how many times did you get busted listening in on Derek 's calls ?

DEREK: OUCH ! ! ! That 's pretty cold . How long were you together ?
LISA: Two months . small laugh ) Actually , it was one of my longer lasting elationships . I do n't know what it is ut sooner or later I just seem to scare men off .
BEAT: I 'm starting to think there 's something wrong with me .
DEREK: Nothing wrong with you . Your boyfriend 's a fool , that 's all .
LISA: I wish I could believe that .
DEREK: Maybe you just have n't met the right guy yet .
LISA: I 'm beginning to think all the good ones are taken . D
EREK: Look , I 'm no expert but if it did n't work out , maybe it was n't meant to be . When the right guy comes along you 'll know it .
LISA: Is that how it was with you and Beth ?

DEREK: Lisa , get out of my car !
LISA: Derek , what 's wrong ? What did I do ?
DEREK: I do n't know if you 're just dense o what 's wrong with you but I want you to understand something . There 's nothing going on between us . I would never never jeopardize my job with a co- worker .
ISA: Maybe you are an asshole . Wow .

BETH: I 've been on the phone for the last hou with Rachel MORE ) ( Hendricks .

BETH: At first I could n't even conceive of it . They 've always seemed to be so much in love , totally devoted to each other .
DEREK: Tim told her ?
ETH: Just blurted it out last night when he came home from work . Then he said he was moving out . You know they 've got three kids . Poor Rachel 's a wreck .
DEREK: Yeah . That 's tough .
BETH: Tough ? It 's a disaster . If it was me

EN: Sure you did n't lead her on ? Just a little ? I mean , a pretty girl it would be normal
DEREK: I did n't do a damn thing .

DEREK: Thanks . You 're a big help .
BEN: Sorry What are you going to do ?
DEREK: Report it to Human Resources
BEN: Get her fired ?
DEREK: I do n't have a choice .
BEN: I 'd be very careful if I were you . What if she makes trouble and says you came on to her ?

BEN: Would n't it be cheaper to just have he killed ?

DEREK: Hi , Connie . Is Hank in ? I need to talk to him .
HANK: Derek ? That you ?

BETH: Forget it . He 'll call you in the morning . Come to bed .
BETH: Remember the last time Joe had one of his weekend work retreats ?
DEREK: How could I forget ? I had a hangover fo a week after .
BETH: Any women coming this year ?
DEREK: No , just the usual suspects . Joe says it 's going to be a male bonding experience .
BETH: I can just picture you guys in the hotel jacuzzi , getting in touch with you innermost feelings .
DEREK: Hopefully , they 'll all get drunk and crash early . Or if I 'm really lucky drown in the jacuzzi .
BETH: Call me tonight .
DEREK: I will .
WAITRESS: It 's from the lady at the bar .
JOE: Derek , you okay ?

DEREK: They 're yelling for me to come back .
BETH: It 'll just take a second
DEREK: Beth , I 'll call you later .
BETH: I 'll be in bed Derek ?
LISA: I can always tell from the pained look on your face when you 're talking to Beth .
DEREK: How did you know I 'd be here ?
LISA: I 've got my sources . slight frown ) What 's wrong ? You do n't look happy to see me .
DEREK: Why did you come here ?
LISA: You said you could never be with someone you work with . ( when he does n't seem to `` get
IT": That 's why I quit . So we could be together .
DEREK: Lisa , you need to leave .
LISA: Or what ? You 'll make a scene ?
LISA: One of us has to take control and I guess it 's me . So you go back , say your good nights to the boys and I 'll be waiting in my room . 610 .
DEREK: I 'm not coming to your room .
LISA: Would you rather I came to yours ?
DEREK: You 're crazy sick . You need help .
LISA: I know . I need help . Help me , Derek .
DEREK: Stay away from me !
LISA: All right , Derek . You play your games and I 'll play mine .

BEN: Come on , it 's early . We 'll go to my room and plunder the mini-bar , charge it all to Joe . D

BEN: All right , be that way . But do n't forget . Nine o'clock in the California Room . Joe 's big rah-rah to the troops .
LISA: Shhhhh .
DEREK: No..

DEREK: Leave ! You 've got to go !
LISA: Derek , come on
LISA: Why ? You worried somebody 's gon na catch us ?
DEREK: Just get the hell out .

JOE: Thank god . We were about to send out a search party .
DEREK: Sorry . Overslept .
BEN: What about her ?
DEREK: She 's here .
MYSTIFIED: I 'll be right back .
CLERK: Here 's your wife , sir .
LISA: I thought you might need an excuse to get out of there . How about some lunch ?
DEREK: Lunch ?
LISA: It 's gorgeous outside and I made a eservation at
DEREK: What do you think this is ?
LISA: The morning after ?
DEREK: We did n't do anything last night .
LISA: But you ca n't remember , can you ?
DEREK: It did n't happen !
LISA: Derek , not so loud . You 'll cause a scene .
DEREK: That 's exactly what we Right . A scene . need .
LISA: What are you doing ?
DEREK: What I should have done last night . Taking you inside to tell Joe and the others whatever you want . They 'll know you 're out of your mind .
LISA: Why are you trying to ruin this ?
EREK: THERE IS NO THIS ! ! !
LISA: Do n't say that .
DEREK: Godammit !
LISA: What 's wrong with you ? You 're acting like a stranger .
DEREK: Yeah ! That 's exactly what I am . A stranger , a person you do n't know . Now either go inside and tell them you ullshit lies or get the hell out of here .
LISA: You think you can use me , then throw me away ? I 'm not some piece of garbage , Derek . I 'm a human being
DEREK: How else do you look at somebody who sickens and repulses you ?
DEREK: I do n't care what you do or what you say . What goes on in that twisted mind of yours . It does n't matter because the truth is , there 's never going to be anything between us . So go ahead , Lisa do your worst .
BEN: Derek , you drinking ?
DEREK: Not tonight , man . I 'm sticking to ice tea .
EREK: No . No fucking way
SHOUTS: Lisa !
REYES: All right , Mister Charles , let me get this straight . E )
DEREK: I know how it sounds but , yeah , that 's pretty much it .
REYES: This affair
DEREK: There WAS NO affair .
REYES: So she just made it up in her head ? With no help from you ?
DEREK: Maybe I was too nice to her , said something she took the wrong way , I do n't know . All I know is I did not lead he on .
REYES: And you had no idea she 'd be at the hotel ?
DEREK: None . I do n't even know how she got in my room .
REYES: Apparently she told one of the housekeepers she was your wife and lost her key .
DEREK: Does n't that prove she did this on he own ?
REYES: All it proves is she lost her key .
DEREK: She never had a key .
REYES: Look , Mister Charles , I do n't care if you were or were n't banging this girl . I just need to get your version for my eport .
REYES: Let 's just say I would n't like to explain a situation like this to my husband .
DEREK: How is she ?
REYES: They pumped her out in time . Doctor says she 's groggy and disoriented . Probably tomorrow they 'll move her out of ICU and up to the fifth floor for a psychiatric evaluation . All suicides are put on 72 hour hold , it 's standard .
EREK: Did she say anything ?
REYES: As a matter of fact , she was lucid long enough to give the doctor a name to call in case of emergency . He wrote it down . Here .
BETH: Tell me everything . From the beginning .
DEREK: You think I encouraged it ?
BETH: Maybe you liked it .
DEREK: Beth
BETH: What man would n't ? The attentions of a pretty young girl ? I can just see those adoring blue eyes batting at you every time you told her how pretty she looked or what a nice dress
DEREK: Stop it , Beth . You know I never said those things .
BETH: You must have said something . Done something to give her the idea .
DEREK: If I did , it was n't intentional .
ETH: She was in your bed , Derek ! You spent the night together and you want me to elieve nothing happened ?
DEREK: I was passed out drunk . Nothing happened .
BETH: Damn you , Derek . Damn you .
DEREK: I love you , Beth . I love Kyle and the life we have together . I would never do anything to screw that up . This girl is disturbed . She 's seriously disturbed and for some reason , she fixated on me .
DEREK: I do n't know . She 's crazy .
BETH: You should have told me . From the very eginning , you should have told me .
DEREK: I know .
BETH: Why did n't you ?
DEREK: At first I thought it was no big deal . And then I was just embarrassed . I did n't know how to explain it to you without looking
BETH: Guilty ?
DEREK: I said I was wrong .
BETH: Did she know about us , Derek ?
DEREK: What ?
BETH: How we met ?
DEREK: Do n't do this , Beth . You 'll make yourself sick .
BETH: I 'm already sick .
DEREK: Honey , I know I screwed up
BETH: I do n't know what to believe . All I know is , I need to be alone for awhile .
DEREK: Beth , do n't
BETH: I need to be alone
REYES: Miss Reynolds ? I 'm Monica Reyes .
LISA: Come in . I 'm sorry I 'm such a mess but they wo n't let me take a shower or wash my hair . Apparently I 'm still on suicide watch .
REYES: I 'm a police officer assigned to you case . How are you feeling ?
LISA: Well , still a bit groggy from the medication . But it is n't stopping me from feeling ashamed for all the trouble I 've caused .
REYES: Do you feel like talking about the othe night ?
LISA: Have you spoken to Derek ?
REYES: Yes .
LISA: And he 's all right ?
REYES: Relatively speaking .
ISA: When can I see him ?
EYES: See him ?
LISA: Derek .
REYES: I 'm afraid that 's not possible .
LISA: Why ?
REYES: Miss Sheridan , I do n't think Miste Charles wants to speak to you or continue any kind of contact .
LISA: Then why did he send these ? Really ?
REYES: He sent you flowers ?
REYES: When did these show up ?
LISA: A few hours ago . They 're lovely , are n't they ?
REYES: Can you tell me what happened at the hotel , why you were there .
LISA: Did n't Derek tell you ?
REYES: I 'd like to hear your version .
LISA: There 's not a lot to tell . We got together at the hotel and you can guess what we did .
EYES: Slept together . Had sex .
LISA: Of course .
REYES: Derek denies it .
LISA: He 's just being a gentleman , trying to protect me .
REYES: I see . Go on .
LISA: The next day when Derek told me his wife would n't give him a divorce and that we could never see each other again , I guess I over reacted .
BEAT: I did n't realize he was just being noble .
REYES: Noble ?
LISA: He was thinking about his little boy , Kyle what the breakup might do to him . He 's not even two , you know . My parents oke up when I was pretty young . It leaves a scar that never really heals .
REYES: So you believe Mister Charles is in love with you ? L
ISA: Read the card . Derek and I belong together and nothing can change that . But I do feel bad about his wife .
EYES: You do ?
LISA: I 'm not a home-wrecker . I 'm not stealing him away . Their marriage is dead and Beth is in denial . It ca n't be easy to find out that the man she loves is in love with another woman . I just hope she does n't do something foolish . strange smile ) You know the old saying .
REYES: What 's that ?
LISA: `` Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned . ''
REYES: You take it easy now . We 'll talk again .
JOE: I do n't have to tell you how an incident like this could impact the company . Even the slightest whiff of impropriety
DEREK: There was no impropriety , Joe . This is just the sick fantasy of a very disturbed girl .
JOE: Who might retaliate by hitting us with a sexual harassment lawsuit .
DEREK: There was no sexual harassment . If anything , I 'm the one who was sexually harassed .
SIGHS: I ca n't believe this is happening to me . It 's like a nightmare .
JOE: By now , you 're probably wishing you had fucked her .
THEN: Sorry . Bad joke .
DEREK: Goddamit , Joe , if there 's an injured party here , it 's me .
JOE: Derek , calm down . I believe you and you know I 'll back you up all the way . But if I find out there was something going on , I wo n't have a choice .
DEREK: That 's not going to happen because there 's nothing to find out .
OE: Good . Then you have nothing to worry about . Meantime I 'm going to put Ben on the Ganz account .
DEREK: But Ganz is my client
JOE: Look , maybe you should take some time off . Just til this blows over .
MARGE: Sorry to interrupt . Derek , there 's a Detective Reyes here to see you .
DEREK: She obviously ordered the flowers fo herself .
REYES: With your credit card .
DEREK: My secretary keeps all my personal information on her computer . Lisa must have accessed it when she was working my desk .
REYES: There 's more .
DEREK: More ?
REYES: This is a print out of Lisa 's blog . It 's sort of a diary she was keeping .
EREK: What ?
REYES: You can read them for yourself but I should warn you they 're a little X- ated .
DEREK: This is none of this ever happened . I was never at her apartment . I never even touched her , let alone did any of this
REYES: According to those entries , you 're quite the accomplished lover , Mister Charles . And you made promises to her , promises to divorce your wife and marry her
DEREK: You ca n't possibly believe this .
REYES: Whether I believe it or not is irrelevant . The only thing that matters is that she believes it .
DEREK: There 's got to be something I can do to protect myself my family .
REYES: You could file a restraining order . But that may not be necessary .
DEREK: Why not ?
LISA: Lisa 's left town . She was released in the custody of an older sister yesterday . Her sister flew down from San Francisco and took her back . Lisa 's agreed to check herself into a neuropsychiatric hospital up there .
DEREK: Well , I ca n't say I 'm unhappy to hea she 's gone . Maybe now she can get the help she needs .
REYES: W ith any luck , Mister Charles , you 'll never hear from her again .
DEREK: `` Four little ducks went out one day over the hill and far away ''
BETH: You 've got our cell numbers so if there 's any problem , do n't hesitate to call us , okay ?
DEREK: Come on , honey . Samantha knows what to do , do n't you ?
SAMANTHA: I 've got four little brothers . Trust me . I 'm really good at this .
BETH: I do n't know . Maybe we should
DEREK: No way . Do you know how hard it was to get these reservations ? Come on , we agreed . This is an important night . And I am not gon na waste you in that outfit . She looks fantastic , does n't she ?
SAMANTHA: Like a movie star .
DEREK: Everything 's gon na be fine .
BETH: Okay , but you call us .
DEREK: Lock this . We 'll be back by ten .
SAMANTHA: Have fun .
EREK: I have n't seen you looking this relaxed and beautiful in weeks .
BETH: I 'd forgotten what this was like the two of us out together .
DEREK: Yeah . It 's been awhile .
ENCOURAGED: So there 's hope ?
BETH: It 's not that easy .
DEREK: I need you to believe me .
BETH: Derek , not everybody gets drunk and does things they regret .
DEREK: I keep telling you I did n't do any thing to regret .
BETH: I am telling you you did .
LISA: Hi , I 'm Beth 's friend Allie . She 's expecting me .
SAMANTHA: Mister and Mrs. Charles are out .
LISA: Out ?
SAMANTHA: They went to dinner .
LISA: What ? Beth told me to drop by . That 's strange . Oh well , I have something fo Kyle . I 'll just run up and give it to him .
SAMANTHA: You ca n't . He 's sleeping .
LISA: Oh , I wo n't wake him .
SAMANTHA: Maybe you should come back .
LISA: But I 'm here right now . Why should I oh , I see . Just doing your duty . Good girl . You know what , let me call Beth .
CELL: Oh , wait . Did you want to talk to her ?
LISA: Thanks , Samantha . Nice meeting you .
SAMANTHA: ( preoccupied ; does n't even
LOOK: You , too .
BETH: It 's his birthday tomorrow .
DEREK: I know .
BETH: I told him we 'd take him to Legoland .
DEREK: I 'll go on-line tonight and order the tickets . Unless you think you should take him alone .
BETH: No . Whatever we 're going through , he needs us to be together .
SAMANTHA: Hey ! You guys got back so fast
BETH: Any trouble with Kyle ?
SAMANTHA: No . He was a doll .
THEN: But you just missed your friend .
BETH: What friend ?
SAMANTHA: You know . Allie ? She was just here called you on the cell ?
BETH: Nobody called me
DEREK: Someone was here ? Inside the house ?
SAMANTHA: You said it was okay . She said she had something for Kyle
BETH: Oh my god ! Where 's Kyle ?
SAMANTHA: In his crib .
DEREK: How long since she was here ?
SAMANTHA: A couple minutes . What 's wrong ?
AFRAID: You said it was okay !
LISA: She took him ! She took my baby !
EREK: Call 911 !
DEREK: Kyle
DOCTOR: We pumped his stomach . X-ray and cat scan came back normal . We 'll wait for the lood work but it appears he 's completely fine . I do n't see any reason why you ca n't take Bhim home in a couple hours .
ETH: Thank you , Doctor .
REYES: Apparently Lisa stole her sister 's ID to uy a ticket and board a plane to LA earlier today , then used her sister 's credit card to rent a car . The siste did n't even know she was gone until a few hours ago . She said Lisa had been doing well in therapy . She did n't know she checked herself out this morning
BETH: She was in our house alone with ou son .
DEREK: he doctor says he 's fine .
BETH: Well , I 'm not fine . to Reyes ; demanding ) I want you to find her .
REYES: We will . She violated the restraining order so we can arrest her . Look , Mrs. Charles , I know you 're upset . I 'm a mother , too
BETH: How would you feel if it was your child ?
REYES: Exactly the same as you .
BETH: Find her .
DEREK: Now what ? Am I supposed to go out and uy a gun or something ?
REYES: She did n't physically harm him .
DEREK: No , but she could have . Is that the message she 's trying to send ?
BETH: Derek !
BETH: She never left . She was here the whole time .
DEREK: It 's all right , it 's all right

DEREK: What 's wrong ?
BETH: Mom went back in for more tests . They wanted to do another biopsy and she 's pretty scared .
BETH: I 'm sure it 'll be fine but I thought I 'd drive down to San Diego to hold her hand , take Kyle with me .
DEREK: I 'm gon na be stuck here pretty late but I could drive down after
BETH: I do n't think that 's a good idea . Friday night traffic 's gon na be a nightmare and they wo n't know the results til tomorrow . Why do n't you do what you need to do and drive down in the morning ?

ATRICK: I do n't think that 's gon na happen .
LISA'S VOICE: Of course it is
PATRICK: I 'm not sure I should be telling you this
LISA: Patrick , do n't be such a drama queen . I thought we were friends .
PATRICK: We are , we are .

RUSTY: Alright . Who 's here ?
TOPHER: Josh is here . Seth is here . David could n't make it . He 's got two weeks of reshoots on Lusitania ecause somebody just figured out forty percent of the budget is coming from Germany .

DANNY: My fence seemed confident enough .
RUSTY: If you 're dealing with cash , you do n't need a fence .

RUSTY: Probably everybody in cell block E .
DANNY: Well , that 's all behind us now .
RUSTY: I should hope so .

DANNY: Thanks for the game , fellas . Hey , I hate to ask this , but could you sign something for me ? It 's for the guys in the joint . They just love all your shows .
RUSTY: That was , that was just
DANNY: Unprofessional . Rusty agrees .
RUSTY: How was the clink ? You get the cookies I sent you ?
DANNY: Why do you think I came to see you first ?
RUSTY: You barge into my new workplace , uin my professional reputation , least you could do is tell me you 've got something better fo me .
DANNY: I 've got something better fo you .
RUSTY: How 's Tess ?
DANNY: It 's tricky . No one 's ever done it before . Needs planning , a large crew .
RUSTY: Guns ?
DANNY: Not loaded ones . It has to be very precise . There 's a lot of security . But the take
RUSTY: What 's the target ?
DANNY: Eight figures each .
RUSTY: What 's . The . Target .
DANNY: When 's the last time you were in Vegas ?
RUSTY: What ? You wan na knock over a casino ?
DANNY: The vault at the Bellagio .
RUSTY: If I 'm reading these right and I think that I am this is probably the least accessible vault ever designed . Oops . Actually , you know what , I 'm wrong . It 's definitely the least accessible vault eve designed .
DANNY: Yep . Rusty 's brow furrows just a little .
RUSTY: You said three casinos
DANNY: These feed into the cages at both the Mirage and the M.G.M . Grand . But every dime ends up here .
RUSTY: The Bellagio , Mirage , and These are Terry Benedict 's places .
DANNY: Yes , they are . Think he 'll mind ?
RUSTY: More than somewhat .
DANNY: Like what , you think ?
RUSTY: Well , off the top of my head , I 'd say you 're looking at a Boesky , a Jim Brown , a Miss Daisy , two Jethros , and a Leon Spinks . Oh , and the biggest Ella Fitzgerald ever . Where do you think you 're gon na get the money to back this ?
DANNY: As long as we 're hitting these three casinos , we 'll get ou ankroll . Terry Benedict has a list of enemies .
RUSTY: But does he have enemies with loose cash and nothing to lose Aha .
DANNY: Aha .
RUSTY: Reuben .
DANNY: So
RUSTY: So , here 's what I think You should take this plan , kick it around for a week or two . Sleep on it . Turn it over in your head . Then never bring it up to me again .
DANNY: Uh-huh . So what are you saying ?
RUSTY: I 'm saying this is like trying to build a house of cards on the deck of a speeding boat .
DANNY: Really ? I thought it was much harder than that
SECURITY GUARD: Sorry . You two done up here ? Find what you wanted ?
DANNY: Yeah , thanks . You mind if we orrow a couple drawings for the night ? Make some copies .
SECURITY GUARD: Whatever you need .
DANNY: 'Preciate it .
RUSTY: I need a reason . And do n't say money . Why do this ?
DANNY: Why not do it ?
RUSTY: You 're been practicing that speech , have n't you ?
DANNY: A little . Did I rush it ? It felt like I rushed it .
RUSTY: No , it was good .
TISHKOFF: Are you listening to me ? You are , oth of you , nuts . I know more about casino security than any man alive . I invented it , and it can not be beaten . They got cameras , they got watchers , they got locks , they got timers , they got vaults . They got enough armed personnel to occupy Paris . Okay , ad example
DANNY: It 's never been tried .
TISHKOFF: Oh , it 's been tried . A few guys even came close . You know the three most successful robberies in Vegas history ?
TISHKOFF: And the closest any man has gotten to robbing a Las Vegas casino
TISHKOFF: Outside of Caesar 's in '87 . He came , he grabbed , he got conquered .
RUSTY: You 're right . He 's right .
DANNY: Reuben , you 're right . Our eyes are bigger than our stomachs .
RUSTY: That 's exactly it . Pure ego .
TISHKOFF: Yeah yeah blah blah .
DANNY: Thank you so much for setting us straight . Sorry we bothered you . They both rise to go .
TISHKOFF: Look , we all go way back . I owe you from that thing with the guy in the place , and I 'll neve forget it .
DANNY: It was our pleasure .
RUSTY: I 'd never been to Belize .
TISHKOFF: Give Dominic your addresses , I got some remaindered furniture I wan na send you .
DANNY: The Bellagio , Mirage , and the M.G.M . Grand .
TISHKOFF: Those are Terry Benedict 's casinos .
RUSTY: Say , you know , he 's right .
TISHKOFF: You guys Whadda you got against Terry Benedict ?
DANNY: What do you have against him ? That 's the real question .
TISHKOFF: He torpedoed my casino , muscled me out , now he 's gon na blow it up next month to make way for anothe fuckin ' eyesore . Do n't think I do n't see what you 're doin ' .
RUSTY: What are we doing , Reuben ?
TISHKOFF: You gon na steal from Terry Benedict , you better goddamn know . This sorta thing used to be civilized . You 'd hit a guy , he 'd whack you . Done . But Benedict At the end of this he better not know you 're involved , not know your names , or think you 're dead . Because he 'll kill you , and then he 'll go to work on you .
DANNY: That 's why we 've got to be very careful . We have to be precise . We have to be well-funded .
TISHKOFF: Yeah , you got ta be nuts , too . And you 're gon na need a crew as nuts as you are . Who do you have in mind ?
LIVINGSTON: D-do n't , don't-do n't touch it .
RUSTY: Munitions .

LINUS: Sorry 'bout that .
STOCKBROKER: No problem , guy .
DANNY: Hi , Linus . Sit down .
LINUS: Who are you ?
DANNY: A friend of Bobby Caldwell 's . Sit down .
LINUS: That was n't work , that was practice .
DANNY: You 're either in or out , right now .
LINUS: What is it ?
DANNY: A plane ticket . A job offer .
LINUS: You 're pretty trusting pretty fast .
DANNY: Bobby has every faith in you .
LINUS: Fathers are like that . He did n't tell you ? He does n't like me trading on his name .
DANNY: You do this job , he 'll be trading on yours .

LINUS: Las Vegas , huh ?
DANNY: America 's playground . And our MAIN THEME KICKS IN as we
LIVINGSTON: Trick or treat .
TISHKOFF: What , you guys get a group rate o something ?
TURK: You make it out to Utah much , Saul ?
SAUL: Not as much as I 'd like .
TURK: You should . You 'd like it . You 'd like Provo .
VIRGIL: Anybody see the salsa goes with this ?
DANNY: Everybody eaten ? Good . Everybody sober ? Close enough . Most of you know each other already . You probably have n't met Linus Caldwell before , he 's Bobby 's kid outta Chicago . Linus trades nods around the room .
BASHER: What the hell .
LINUS: Hi .
TISHKOFF: You 're Bobby Caldwell 's kid , huh ?
LINUS: Yeah .
TISHKOFF: From Chicago ?
LINUS: Yeah .
TISHKOFF: It 's nice there . You like it ?
LINUS: Yeah .
TISHKOFF: That 's wonderful . Get in the goddamn room .
DANNY: Gentlemen the 14000 block of Las Vegas Boulevard . Otherwise known as the Bellagio , the Mirage , the M.G.M . Grand . Together , they 're the three most profitable casinos in Las Vegas
DANNY: Gentlemen the Bellagio vault . Located below the Strip , beneath two hundred feet of solid earth . It safeguards every dime that comes through each of the three casinos above it . And we 're going to rob it . Everyone takes a breath , awed .
LINUS: Smash-and-grab job , huh ?
RUSTY: It 's a little more complicated than that .
DANNY: Courtesy of Frank Catton , new lackjack dealer at the Bellagio , security tapes from the three casinos .
DANNY: Okay . Bad news first . This place houses a security system which ivals most nuclear missile silos . First we have to get within the casino cages
RUSTY: here , here , and here
DANNY: which anyone knows takes more than a smile . Next through these doors , each of which equires a different six-digit code changed every twelve hours . Past those lies the elevator , and this is where it gets tricky the elevator wo n't move without authorized fingerprint identifications
RUSTY: which we ca n't fake
DANNY: and vocal confirmations from oth the security center within the Bellagio and the vault below - -
RUSTY: which we wo n't get .
DANNY: Furthermore , the elevator shaft is igged with motion detectors
RUSTY: meaning if we manually override the lift , the shaft 's exit will lock down automatically and we 'll e trapped .
DANNY: Once we 've gotten down the shaft , though , then it 's a walk in the park just three more guards with Uzis and predilections toward not eing robbed , and the most elaborate vault door conceived by man . Any questions ?
RUSTY: No . Tunneling is out . There are Richter scales monitoring the ground for one hundred yards in every direction . If a groundhog tried to nest there , they 'd know about it . Anyone else ?
TURK: You said something about good news
DANNY: The Nevada Gaming Commission stipulates a casino must hold in eserve enough cash to cover every chip at play on its floor . As I mentioned , this vault services each of the three casinos above it . That means during the week , y law , it must hold anywhere from sixty to seventy million dollars in cash and coin . On a weekend , etween eighty and ninety million . On a fight night , like the one two weeks from tonight , the night we 're going to rob it , at least a hundred and fifty million . Without eaking a sweat . Now there are eleven of us . Each with an equal share . You do the math .
RUSTY: That 's what I said .
SAUL: I have a question . Say we do get into the cage , and through the security doors there , and down the elevator we ca n't move , and past the guards with guns , and into the vault we ca n't open
RUSTY: Without being seen by the cameras .
DANNY: Oh , right . Sorry . I forgot to mention that .
SAUL: Say we do all that . We 're just supposed to walk outta there with a hundred million dollars in cash on us without getting stopped ?
DANNY: Yeah .
LIVINGSTON: Well , it 's not the least accessible system I 've seen , but it 's close . I do n't suppose they have a closed-circuit feed I could tap into ?
LIVINGSTON: Then this is definitely a black ag job . Do they employ an in- house technician ?
RUSTY: Two . And one of them is lonely . DANCE MUSIC overwhelms the SOUNDTRACK
DANCER: I 'll be right back , honey . Do n't move a muscle .
TECHNICIAN: Depends on the muscle .
RUSTY: Thanks , Charmaine . I 'll have it ack within the hour . Say hello to your mom for me .
DANCER: Say it yourself . She 'll be onstage in five minutes .
TOURIST: Hey , watch it , bud
SLIM: 433 , we have visual impairment on the east door camera .
SENTRY: Excuse me , sir You 're going to have to move your balloons .
VIRGIL: Who you calling 'bud , ' pal ?
TURK: Yeah yeah yeah , whatever , balloon oy .
SENTRY: Gentlemen , gentlemen
DANNY: Why do they paint hallways that color ?
RUSTY: They say taupe is very soothing .
DANNY: Uh-oh .
FAT: Hiya .
LIVINGSTON: Fine , thanks .
FAT: Hey
VIRGIL: Hey get your own balloons .
FAT: Hey
LIVINGSTON: Thanks . And he 's out .
DANNY: Well
RUSTY: Yeah
DANNY: Fourth task construction
LINUS: Benedict .
DANNY: Learn to love his shadow . Sixth task transport
LINUS: Wait , wait , wait . All I get to do is watch him ?
DANNY: For now . You got ta walk before you crawl .
RUSTY: Reverse that .
DANNY: Sixth task transport
BILLY TIM: I 'm sorry eighteen-five each is the best offer I can make you .
FRANK: Oh , I understand perfectly . They are beautiful vans . Well , I thank you for your time , Mister ?
BILLY TIM: Denham . Billy Tim Denham .
FRANK: Yes , Denham , like a jean . You know you have lovely hands do you moisturize ?
BILLY TIM: I 'm sorry ?
FRANK: I swear by it . I try all sorts of lotions . I went through a fragrance-free period last year , ut now I 'm liking this new brand fortified with rose hip . My sister , you know , she uses the aloe vera with the sun screen uilt in
BILLY TIM: Uh-huh . You said you 'd be willing to pay in cash ?
FRANK: I did . You know they say cinnamon is wonderful for you pores . Read that on the internet . And that ideally you should be wearing gloves to bed , but I find that would interfere with my social agenda . Problem is I get a reaction to camphor so I ca n't use traditional remedies
BILLY TIM: If you could pay cash , I could probably drop the price a little . To , say , seventeen sixteen each .
FRANK: That would be lovely .
DANNY: Power , surveillance , transport
TISHKOFF: Anything I can do ?
DANNY: Get your wallet .
SAUL: This is nice material .
DANNY: It 's Armani , Saul .
SAUL: It 's very nice .
DANNY: Saul , you sure you 're ready to do this ?
SAUL: If you ever question me again , Daniel , you wo n't wake up the following morning .
DANNY: You 're ready .
SAUL: Hello . My name is Lyman Zerga My name is Lyman Zerga
DANNY: There 's a little over twenty grand there , Saul . Try to make it last .
SAUL: You seen my
DANNY: Bought you a fresh roll .
VIRGIL: Mr. Zerga , we 're here .
DANNY: Good luck , Lyman .
SAUL: Luck is for losers .
V.I.P. CONCIERGE: Good afternoon , sir . How can I be of service ?
SAUL: My name is Lyman Zerga . I 'd like a suite , please .
V.I.P. CONCIERGE: Do you have a reservation with us ?
SAUL: I do n't make reservations .
RUSTY: Okay . Tell me about Benedict .
LINUS: The guy is a machine .
RUSTY: And that portfolio contains the codes to all the cage doors ?
LINUS: Two minutes after they 've been changed , he 's got 'em in hand . I 'll tell you you guys picked a helluva target . He is as smart and ruthless as they come . The last guy caught cheating here , Benedict not only sent him up fo ten years , he got the bank to seize the guy 's home and ankrupted
RUSTY: his brother-in-law 's tracto dealership , I heard .
LINUS: He does n't just go after you knees , he goes after you livelihood . And everyone-you- ever-met 's livelihood .
RUSTY: You scared ?
LINUS: You suicidal ?
RUSTY: Only in the morning . Now what ?
LINUS: Now comes the girl if she comes in after he does , that means they 're in a snit .
RUSTY: Where 's she come from ?
LINUS: The museum downstairs . She 's the curator there . Wait here she is . You 'll like this . Rusty looks up as
LINUS: I do n't know if we can use he yet . I have n't even caught he name .
RUSTY: Tess .
LINUS: What ?
RUSTY: Her name is Tess .
TISHKOFF: This looks familiar . Where 'd you get this ?
VIRGIL: Off your Rolls .
TISHKOFF: Danny ! Tell 'em not to touch the Rolls !
DANNY: 29 47 . Everything okay in there ?
RUSTY: But what does n't beat the shit out of being a circus performer ?
DANNY: What is it ?
RUSTY: Tell me this is n't about her . O I 'll walk off the job right now . Tess . She 's with Terry Benedict now . Tell me this is n't about screwing the guy who 's screwing your wife .
DANNY: Ex-wife .
RUSTY: Tell me .
DANNY: It 's not . About that . Entirely . A beat .
RUSTY: Here 's the problem we 're stealing two things now . And when push comes to shove , if you ca n't have both , which are you gon na choose ? And remember Tess does n't divide eleven ways . A beat .
DANNY: If things go to plan , I wo n't be the one who has to make that choice . The two men stand quietly for a moment .
DANNY: How 'd she look by the way ? Tess
RUSTY: I 've seen her happier .
TESS: He painted it in the summer of 1912 , after the break-up with Fernande Olivier .
SELLER: She must have put him through hell .
TESS: You can see the conflict . He makes her both erotic and grotesque . He 's hopelessly drawn to her , and yet she drives him crazy .
BENEDICT: Am I late ?
TESS: Not at all , Mr. Benedict . Allow me to introduce to you Mr. Jean Santaniello .
BENEDICT: Mr. Santaniello , I apologize if I kept you . I had to iron out a few issues with my fight promoter . I gave him an unlimited budget , and he exceeded it .
SELLER: I understand it 's going to be a hell of a fight .
BENEDICT: We hope . Tess angles Benedict toward the painting .
TESS: Here it is .
BENEDICT: Magnificent ! I 've been following her for fifteen years now . At last I 've made her a home . All the arrangements and so forth
SELLER: Done . She 's yours .
BENEDICT: Not mine . She belongs to everyone who comes into my hotel . Is n't that right , Ms . Ocean ?
TESS: Yes , Mr. Benedict .
BENEDICT: She 's lovely , is n't she ? I ca n't be the only one who was after her .
SELLER: You 're the only one who met my price .
BENEDICT: Ah , but this You ca n't put a price on beauty . But I should n't philosophize . I own casinos , after all .
TESS: You like it ?
BENEDICT: I like that you like it . I have some bad news from the world of high fashion . It seems Mike Tyson will be wearing red on Saturday night . Red trunks with a white stripe .
TESS: Oh ?
BENEDICT: And you , as I recall , will be wearing a red Donna Karan ? And when the TV cameras pick us up in the front row , that red dress
TESS: I see .
BENEDICT: He 's a charming man , but no one 's going to be watching him when they can make a study of you . I 've asked Paolo to find three or fou things for you to try . I hope you 're not too disappointed . She is , but she buries it .
TESS: What ? We 're alone .
BENEDICT: In my hotels , there 's always someone watching . But he kisses her anyway .
TESS: I 'll see you tonight .
BENEDICT: Actually , I do like it .
SAUL: I do n't believe in weakness . It costs too much . I do n't believe in questions , either .
BENEDICT: Eddie . Anything for me ?
PIT BOSS: Mr. Zerga , sir . Lyman Zerga . In the third position . Wishes to speak with you privately .
BENEDICT: Who is he ?
PIT BOSS: Businessman of some kind , working mostly in Europe . He 's very vague , but I asked around . Word is he deals primarily in arms . One of the biggest .
BENEDICT: Zerga ? Never heard of him .
PIT BOSS: Yessir . That 's why I do n't doubt it .
BENEDICT: He 's staying here ?
PIT BOSS: Checked in two nights ago , sir . He 's in the Mirador suite .
BENEDICT: How 's he doing ?
PIT BOSS: Up . Almost forty grand .
BENEDICT: Good for him
TESS: You 're thirty seconds late . I was about to send out a search party Danny
DANNY: Hello , Tess .
TESS: What are you doing here ?
DANNY: I 'm out .
TESS: You 're out .
DANNY: Of prison . You remember . The day I went for cigarettes and neve came back . You must have noticed .
TESS: I do n't smoke . Do n't sit
DANNY: They said I 'd paid my debt to society .
TESS: Funny , I never got a check . Danny smiles . Tess stares daggers .
DANNY: You 're not wearing your ring . A beat .
TESS: I sold it . And I do n't have a husband . Or did n't you get the papers ?
DANNY: My last day inside .
TESS: I told you I 'd write .
DANNY: Benedict ?
TESS: Danny
DANNY: You 're doing a great job curating the museum . She sighs , exasperated .
TESS: Remind you of anyone ?
DANNY: And I still get Monet and Manet confused . Which one married his mistress ?
TESS: Monet .
DANNY: Right . Manet had syphilis .
TESS: They also painted occasionally . A beat .
DANNY: You do n't know how many times I played this conversation out in my head the last two years .
TESS: Did it always go this poorly ?
DANNY: Yes .
TESS: Sounds frustrating .
DANNY: You were never easy . Okay . I 'll make this quick . I came here for you . I 'm gon na get on with my life , and I want you with me .
TESS: You 're a thief and a liar .
DANNY: I only lied about being a thief . But I do n't do that anymore .
TESS: Steal ?
DANNY: Lie .
TESS: I 'm with someone now who does n't have to make that kind of distinction .
DANNY: No , he 's very clear on both .
TESS: Nice . Work on that for two years , too ?
DANNY: Year and a half . A light smile from Tess .
TESS: Do you know what your problem is ?
DANNY: I only have one ?
TESS: You 've met too many people like you . I 'm with Terry now .
DANNY: Does he make you laugh ?
TESS: He does n't make me cry .
HIGH ROLLER: You do n't want to get in the hole too heavy to this Benedict . A friend of mine once borrowed a hundred g 's from the guy . Two months went by , Benedict had n't heard from him , he calls my friend up , asks 'Where 's my money ? ' I 'll get to it when I get to it , ' my friend says . Half hour late Benedict 's in my friend 's hotel oom , dangling him off his 10th floor balcony by his feet . 'You gon na get to it now ? ' High Roller turns over a nine . Saul wins .
FRANK: Bank wins natural nine . Benedict steps forward .
HIGH ROLLER: Hiya , Terry .
BENEDICT: Mr. Weintraub . How 's everything ?
HIGH ROLLER: Eh . They put too much grenadine in my Shirley Temple .
BENEDICT: And here I thought you were drinking vodka . Mr. Zerga .
SAUL: Mr. Benedict . I recognize you from the TV . You know , nine casinos out of ten , owner comes up in the middle of the hand to ask me what I want . I respect your waiting .
BENEDICT: You 're the guest , sir .
SAUL: And I have to impose on you hospitality . Can you sit in for a hand ?
BENEDICT: I 'd love to , Mr. Zerga , but the gaming board would feed me to my white tigers .
SAUL: That 's a shame . You 're the king of Vegas and you have to play craps in the alley .
BENEDICT: No shame at all . Reminds me of my youth .
SAUL: The fight is Saturday , is it not ?
BENEDICT: Yes . I can get you seats
SAUL: No , no . Hand-to-hand combat does n't interest me . I have a package arriving here Saturday evening . A black briefcase , standard size , the contents of which are very valuable to me .
BENEDICT: I 'd be happy to put it in the house safe for you .
SAUL: The house safe is for brandy and grandmother 's pearls . I 'm afraid I need something more secure .
BENEDICT: I can assure you , the house safe is utterly
SAUL: I can assure you , Mr. Benedict , your generosity in this matte will not go overlooked . Now what can you offer me besides the safe ?
TESS: See , the kind of people you steal things from , they have insurance to compensate them . They get made whole again . I had to leave New York to get away from what happened . How do I get my five years back , Danny ?
DANNY: You ca n't . But what you can do is not throw away another five years .
TESS: You do n't know anything about
DANNY: Listen , you do n't love me anymore , you want to make a life with someone else ? Fine , I 'll have to live with that . But not him .
TESS: Spoken like a true ex-husband .
DANNY: I 'm not joking , Tess .
TESS: I 'm not laughing . You have to admit there 's a conflict of interest when you give me advice about my love life . Danny exhales and leans back .
DANNY: Yes . But that does n't mean I 'm wrong .
TESS: Do you remember what I said to you when we first met ?
DANNY: You said you better know what you 're doing .
TESS: Do you ? Now ? Because truly you should walk out the door if you do n't .
DANNY: I know what I 'm doing .
BENEDICT: What are you doing ?
DANNY: Catching up .
TESS: Terry , meet my ex-husband
DANNY: Danny Ocean .
BENEDICT: Mr . Ocean . Forgive me for being late . A guest required my attention .
TESS: Danny was just walking through the estaurant and spotted me .
BENEDICT: Is that right ?
DANNY: I was shocked myself . Imagine the odds .
BENEDICT: 'Of all the gin joints in all the world ' You 've been in prison until ecently , is n't that right ? How does it feel to be out ?
DANNY: About the same . Everything you want is still on the other side .
BENEDICT: There 's the human condition fo you .
TESS: Terry , Danny was just about to
DANNY: I just wanted to say hello . Fo old time 's sake .
BENEDICT: Stay for a drink , if you like .
TESS: He ca n't
DANNY: I ca n't .
BENEDICT: Well , then I do n't imagine we 'll e seeing you again , Mr . Ocean .
DANNY: You never know .
BENEDICT: I know everything that happens in my hotels .
DANNY: So I should put those towels back .
BENEDICT: The towels you can keep .
DANNY: Good seeing you , Tess .
TESS: Take care , Danny . Danny goes . When he 's out the door
BENEDICT: Do n't be .
BASHER: Just jumping into the shower , can you come back later ?
REPORTER: and here 's Reuben Tishkoff , former owner of the Paradiso , come to bid farewell to his fabled esort and wish Terry Benedict all the best with his future plans fo the property
BENEDICT: Good to see you .
REUBEN: Go shit in your mouth .
BENEDICT: I hope there 's as much dynamite in the Paradiso as there will be in this Saturday 's fight .
REUBEN: G'bye , honey
BASHER: Shit .
RUSTY: Call is at five-thirty . Makeup and costume . Saul 's package arrives at seven-fifteen , and Linus grabs our codes . All goes well there and we 're a go . Seven- thirty Virgil and Turk deliver Yen and we 're committed . From that point , we have thirty minutes to low the power or he suffocates .
RUSTY: Okay they 've put you in the middle of the room , far from everything . You have to get from here to the door without touching the floor . What do you do ? A WIDER ANGLE reveals we 're
FRANK: Fin says he shorts it .
LIVINGSTON: Make it a sawbuck .
BASHER: We 're in deep shit .
BASHER: The damn demo crew did n't use a coaxial lynch to back the mainline ! Onioned the mainframe couplet ! Reuben leans into Livingston
REUBEN: You understand any of this ?
LIVINGSTON: I 'll explain later .
BASHER: Blew the backup grid one by one ! Like dominoes !
DANNY: Basher . What happened ?
BASHER: So unless we decide to do this jo in Reno , we 're screwed .
RUSTY: We could
DANNY: By tomorrow ?
BASHER: We could use a pinch . Danny stops ; Rusty looks up .
DANNY: What is a pinch ?
RUSTY: For how long ?
BASHER: About ten seconds .
DANNY: Could a pinch take out the powe of an entire city ? Like , I do n't
BASHER: Las Vegas ? But there 's only one pinch in the world big enough to handle it .
DANNY: Where ?
BASHER: Pasadena .
DANNY: You two ready ?
LINUS: Coming with you . Danny smiles and shakes his head .
VIRGIL: Are you a man ?
TURK: Yes . Nineteen .
VIRGIL: Are you alive ?
TURK: Yes . Eighteen .
VIRGIL: Evel Knievel .
TURK: Shit ! Okay , your turn
VIRGIL: Co-sign squared over .0455 .
TURK: No . Co-sign squared over .0415 .
VIRGIL: .04-five-five .
TURK: One-five .
VIRGIL: You 're so wrong .
TURK: You do n't know your string theory , itch .
VIRGIL: Mom told me she loves me more .
TURK: She told me she was going to tell you that .
DANNY: We got it . Let 's go . Turk floors it , and they 're off .
DANNY: Wait a minute . Turk brakes , and they 're not .
BASHER: Then there 'll be two of us who need saving .
DANNY: He knows where we are .
TURK: What ? Would you should n't someone be ehind the wheel ?
DANNY: Alright , back it up , back it up !
DANNY: C'mon , c'mon
YEN: Ahhh !
DANNY: I say stay in the van , you stay in the van , got it ? 'Cause you lose focus for one second in this game , and someone gets hurt .
LINUS: I got it .
JIM LAMPLEY: and even though it 's still five hours 'til the opening bell , the energy here is fever-pitched .
MANAGER: How we doing ?
TISHKOFF: Where are they ? That 's what I want to know . Where are they ?
SAUL: They 'll be here .
TISHKOFF: 'They 'll be here . ' Thanks a lot , Fidel .
LIVINGSTON: Yikes .
RUSTY: You boys have a nice trip ?
LIVINGSTON: We have a problem .
DANNY: This is a problem .
RUSTY: Saul time to get out .
RUSTY: You have any idea how this happened ? Before Danny can answer
LINUS: I do . He 's been chasing Benedict 's woman . Got into a real snarl with him two nights ago . I was tailing you .
DANNY: Who told you to do that ? Before Linus can answer
RUSTY: I did . I knew you could n't leave Tess alone .
TISHKOFF: Who 's Tess ?
DANNY: My wife .
RUSTY: Ex-wife .
SAUL: Tess is here ?
RUSTY: I 'm sorry . I did n't know if it would sting you , but it did . You 're out , Danny .
TISHKOFF: He 's out ? !
RUSTY: It 's that or we shut down right now . His involvement puts us all at risk .
DANNY: This is n't your call .
RUSTY: You made it my call . When you put her ahead of us . You made it mine .
DANNY: This is my job .
RUSTY: Not anymore .
TISHKOFF: But , but he ca n't just be out . Who 's gon na take his place ? Rusty turns to Linus .
RUSTY: Kid , you up for it ?
SAUL: Tess is with Benedict now ? She 's too tall for him .
BENEDICT: Yes . Yes . No . Very much no . Then inform Mr. Levin he 'll find a etter view of the fight in front of his television . Surely he must have H.B.O .
TESS: You .
BENEDICT: Any sign of Ocean ?
MANAGER: Bruiser ? Benedict nods , goes on his way .
SAUL: Mr. Benedict .
BENEDICT: Mr. Zerga . It 's a very busy night for me . Are we on schedule ?
SAUL: I have no reason to suspect otherwise . My couriers should be here momentarily . A beat as Benedict studies Saul .
BENEDICT: It 's a nice evening . Shall we wait outside ?
TURK: Mr. Zerga . A gift from Mr. Hesse .
SAUL: Thank you , Friedrich , Gunther .
FRANK: Lookin ' like a bad night for the house .
BENEDICT: Find Mr. Walsh . Tell him Mr . Ocean 's in the west slots .
BENEDICT: I 'm afraid I ca n't allow my private security personnel inside the casino cages . I hope you do n't mind
SAUL: Of course not . Saul turns to dismiss Virgil and Turk when
RACETRACK DENIZEN: Saul ? Saul Bloom , is that you ?
SAUL: Friedrich , Gunther .
DANNY: Pops , you won . then slips away .
RUSTY: Where you gon na put your hands ? Linus clasps them .
RUSTY: and up they know you do n't know the truth . Do n't use three words when one will do , do n't shift you eyes , look always at your mark but do n't stare , be specific but not memorable , funny but do n't make him laugh , he 's got ta like you then forget you the moment you 've left his sight , and for God 's sakes whatever you do , do n't unde any circumstances
BENEDICT: They 're very beautiful . A gift .
SAUL: Why not ?
BENEDICT: Insurance , for one . Security , another . And I do n't trust you .
SAUL: You leave me no choice . Saul unlocks the cuff from his wrist .
LINUS: Thanks .
TURK: Who ordered the penne ?
RUSTY: You ready ?
WALSH: This is our security center , where we oversee all gaming in the casino as well as our vault . You 'll be able to monitor you iefcase from here .
SAUL: Do n't let me keep you .
BENEDICT: Mr. Zerga And Benedict takes his leave
RUSTY: Linus you 're up .
LINUS: Deep breaths , deep breaths .
BENEDICT: Yes ?
LINUS: Sheldon Wills . Nevada Gaming Commission . Could I have two minutes of your time ?
BENEDICT: Of course . Anything for the
RUSTY: Okay when do you make the deposit ?
TURK: Not until we get your signal .
VIRGIL: Hey . What do we look like a couple of peckerwood jackasses o something ? No one responds .
RUSTY: Amazing how 's it feel ? You alright ? Want something to read ? Magazine ?
LIVINGSTON: You get no tip .
LINUS: It only came to our attention this morning , Mr. Benedict . Apparently he has a record longer than my arm .
BENEDICT: If he is who you say he is . Charlie . Call over Ramon Escalante .
PIT BOSS: Certainly , Mr. Benedict .
RUSTY: Did you make it out ?
LIVINGSTON: His head blocked the last two numbers . We missed it , Linus . You got ta grab the combination yourself .
BENEDICT: You new at the commission ?
LINUS: Been there about two years .
BENEDICT: I know Hal Lindley over there . You work with him at all ?
LINUS: Not since he died last year .
BENEDICT: Mr. Escalante . Would you come with us , please ?
FRANK: What 's this about ?
BENEDICT: I think it 's better if we talked off the floor .
MAITRE D': Good evening , Mr. Tishkoff .
TISHKOFF: Good evening , Marcel . My nieces and I would like a table . Something quiet before the fight .
MAITRE D': I can put you at 19 in just a couple minutes .

DANNY: Try to keep your tongue in you mouth .
TISHKOFF: Yeah , pal , well only if you take your thumb out of your
TESS: Danny No .

TESS: I 'm having you thrown out of here .
DANNY: Tess
TESS: Well , know this no matter what it is , you wo n't win me back . I ca n't afford it .
DANNY: I just came to say good-bye .
TESS: Oh then good-bye .
DANNY: Good-bye .
TESS: Good-bye , Danny .
DANNY: I thought he might .
LINUS: Thank you for your cooperation , Mr. Escalante . Or should I call you Mr. Catton ?
LINUS: You are Frank Catton ? Formerly of the Tropicana , the Desert Inn and the New York State penitentiary system ?
FRANK: Goddamn cracker
LINUS: Pardon me .
FRANK: You heard me . Just 'cause a black man tries to earn a decent wage in this state
LINUS: That has nothing to do with
FRANK: some cracker cowboy like you 's got ta kick him out on the street . Want me to jump down , turn around , pick a bale of cotton , wo n't let me deal cards , might as well call it whitejack .
LINUS: I resent your implication that ace has anything to do with this . Now , as I was saying , the Nevada Gaming Commission strictly forbids the employment of the colored I mean
FRANK: Okay , okay , I 'm cool .
BENEDICT: You alright ?
LINUS: Yeah .
RUSTY: He 's got it . Virgil , Turk deliver you package .
VIRGIL: Aw , I think Jesus . I lost my card .
SECURITY OFFICER: What 's going on here ?
VIRGIL: I think Jesus ! I lost my keycard .
SECURITY OFFICER: Okay . Leave the cart . Go find it . Take this cart inside .
WALSH: There it is now .
SAUL: Wonderful .
RUSTY: That 's my cue . Give Basher the go .
LIVINGSTON: Bash , what 's your status ?
BASHER: No need to yell .
BENEDICT: Please show this man off the premises . Do n't step foot in my casino again .
FRANK: Cracker .

LINUS: Of course .
BENEDICT: You know how to get back out ?
LINUS: Of course . Enjoy the fight .
BENEDICT: Thank you .
FRANK: Thanks , fellas .
DANNY: How much longer do you think Mr. Benedict will be ?
GOON #1: Just a few minutes more . He scans the room .
DANNY: No cameras in this room , huh ? Do n't want anyone seeing what happens here ?
DANNY: I guess Mr. Benedict did n't like me talking to his girl .
GOON #1: We 're gon na step outside now . Leave you two alone to talk things over .
DANNY: Jesus , Bruiser , not 'til later .
BRUISER: Sorry , Danny . I I forgot .
DANNY: S'okay . How 's the wife ?
BRUISER: Pregnant again .
DANNY: Then we better get to work .
LIVINGSTON: Oh shit
WALSH: Does that satisfy you , Mr. Zerga ?
SAUL: Yes , I 'm very satisfied .
WALSH: Close it up .
FAT: You alright , sir ?
LIVINGSTON: Almost there , kid .
FAT: Who 's that ?
LIVINGSTON: Going to video now .
WALSH: Call for a doctor .
DANNY: You did n't really think I was gon na sit this one out , did you ?
LINUS: What , did n't you trust me ?
DANNY: I do now .
RING ANNOUNCER: Ladies and gentlemen ! !
RUSTY: Someone called for a doctor ?
LINUS: How 'd you get here ?
DANNY: Crawlspace . And I had to give away a couple mil .
LINUS: But what about I mean , that whole thing with Rusty Danny just smiles at him .
DANNY: You think the kid bought it ?
RUSTY: Hell , I think Reuben bought it , and he knew we were screwing around . You sure about this ?
DANNY: Bobby Caldwell threw me into the pool first time . Least I could do is give his kid a push .
LINUS: Why 'd you make me go through all this ? Why not just tell me ?
DANNY: Well , where 's the fun in that ? C'mon Yen 's got about three minutes of air left .
RUSTY: He 's gone .
WALSH: You 're too late , guys . He 's dead .
VIRGIL: I told you to hurry .
DANNY: Who do you like tonight ?
LINUS: Huh ?
DANNY: Tyson or Lewis .
LINUS: The fight ? Lewis . You like Tyson ? How strongly do you feel about it ?
DANNY: You looking for action ?
LINUS: I 'd go in for a buck .
DANNY: A buck it is .
RUSTY: Livingston , we 're set .
LIVINGSTON: Basher , we 're set .
BASHER: Just give me a minute .
BASHER: Then give me thirteen seconds .
LINUS: You ever rappelled before ?
DANNY: Never . You ?

DANNY: No , but you 're sweet to ask .
FRANK: Are they in ?
LIVINGSTON: One second . I thought you got kicked out ?
DANNY: Not yet . Okay .
LINUS: You think Yen made it out okay ?
DANNY: I 'm sure he 's fine .
LINUS: Jesus
DANNY: There 's a Chinese man with a hundred sixty million dollars ehind that door . Let 's get him out .
FRANK: Fin says he shorts it .
LIVINGSTON: No bet .
DANNY: Okay .
FRANK: That 's it ?
LIVINGSTON: There 's still the five pins and the floor sensor . Not much we can do about that from this side of the door . But from this side He punches up the image of Yen in the vault .
BASHER: a little bit of Semtex should do the trick .
DANNY: Counting down from twenty now .
LIVINGSTON: Linus , can you read me ? Linus , do not blow the door , you 're about to kill Yen .
LINUS: five , four , three
DANNY: one He presses his detonator . Nothing .
LINUS: What 's wrong ?
DANNY: I do n't know . Linus comes over to look .
LINUS: You check the batteries ? Danny blanches . Linus shoots him a look .
SAUL: Everything going okay ?
LINUS: You know , you lose focus for one second in this game
DANNY: and someone gets hurt , yeah yeah . I do n't hear Yen complaining .
DANNY: Do it . Linus pulls and the door opens .
YEN: Where the fuck you been ?
SAUL: Ever been in love ?
FRANK: No , I guess not . Not really .
SAUL: This is better .
BENEDICT: You gon na answer it ?
TESS: I do n't have a cell phone .
BENEDICT: See who 's on the other end . She takes the phone , activates it .
TESS: Hello ?

RUSTY: The man who 's robbing you .
BENEDICT: What the hell is going on down there in the vault ?
FAT: Nothing , sir . All normal .

BENEDICT: Stop there .
DANNY: What would you say if I told you you could get your money back if you gave up Tess ? What would you say ?
BENEDICT: I would say yes .
DANNY: Well , that 's very interesting but I did n't have anything to do with it . He grins . Benedict sinks .
BENEDICT: Escort Mr . Ocean to the exit . And contact the police . I would imagine Mr . Ocean is in violation of his parole .
WALSH: Maybe we should have held him .
BENEDICT: No . Follow him . Everywhere .
TESS: You of all people should know , Terry in your hotel , there 's always someone watching .
TESS: Wait !

OWNER: Which one is it ?
TESS: I 'm sorry ?
OWNER: Anniversary .
TESS: Oh . Fortieth
OWNER: Wow . Okay . I think I have an idea . Something classic .
TESS: Do you have a bathroom ?
OWNER: Straight back , on the left . It 's unisex .
TESS: Thank you . Tess scurries to the back .
OWNER: It 's unisex !
DANNY: Miguel Diaz speaking .
BENEDICT: The Baldwins .
TESS: What about them ?
BENEDICT: We had dinner with them three years ago . You talked about your parent 's anniversary . She says nothing . BENEDICT I 'm getting married next month .
TESS: So am I .
BENEDICT: Well , I hope Danny is as good as he thinks he is . A bouquet toss in prison can get pretty ugly .
REUBEN: I really think you 're being too sensitive . She 's crazy about you . I can tell .
TURK: The opening does n't work .
VIRGIL: Duh .
TURK: She should n't have the same dream as Franklin . He 's the antagonist .
VIRGIL: It was your idea .
TURK: No it was n't .
VIRGIL: Well , it was n't mine . It could n't e ; it 's too stupid .
TURK: Why do you do that ? why do you have to get personal ?
VIRGIL: It 's not personal , it 's a fact .
TURK: It 's personal . You do n't argue logically . You attack . Bring the right foot back even with the left , buttocks raised high . you have to have reasons , to support your argument flattening the back so the body forms a triangle .
VIRGIL: I ca n't listen to you anymore . It makes me physically sick .
TURK: Relax the crown of the head toward the floor . Draw the hips away from the hands , lengthening the spine . And press the heels toward the floor .
VIRGIL: This a serious class . No pigs allowed . Okay ?
GUY: Sorry .
TURK: Virge .
VIRGIL: Yeah , whatever , OJ .
RUSTY: You are kidding me .
FELIX: And that 's what I sent .
RUSTY: No , Felix , no . I paid for pure . And if my workshop were on top of Mount Everest it would be pure . But I 'm at sea level , Felix , and at sea level it should liquefy at 736.95 . If it 's pure , that is . Which this is n't .
FELIX: Who 's Christo ? Rusty looks to the heavens .
RUSTY: Felix , you 're in a shame spiral . Have your assistant lose my number . Rusty snaps his phone shut . RUSTY My god .
BENEDICT: Four weeks .
FRANK: We stole that money fair and square . You bought people off to find me . You took advantage during an economic downturn , and made them say some shit they should n't have said . It 's not fair , it 's not just , and it aint ' cool . A long beat . Benedict stares back at him . FRANK Did you hear what I just said ?
BENEDICT: I heard what you said , Frank . Did you hear what I said ? Frank looks at Benedict and the Power Twins .
LIVINGSTON: How many people here tonight were stupid enough to have children ? A few people raise their hands . LIVINGSTON Wow . No , seriously , that 's great . I have a child . A daughter . She 's five . They get to you , right ? Am I ight ? Like emotionally . I mean , sometimes she 'll turn to me with her little face and her little shiny eyes , and she 'll say , `` Daddy , please stop hitting me , '' and it just breaks my heart . ' People are n't sure what to make of this . LIVINGSTON I 'm Livingston Dell . Thanks fo listening . See you at ten .
BENEDICT: What can I say ? You 're a funny guy .
SAUL: What it is about horses ? I ask you . Is it the strength ? The beauty ? The fearlessness ? The grace ? Of course . But there 's something else . Something in the eyes . The person with him nods . SAUL Yes . When I look into a horse 's eyes , I can tell This one 's a winner . A jacketed WAITER appears , holding a tray .
WAITER: Excuse me , Mr. Bloom ?
SAUL: Yes ?
WAITER: There appears to be a problem with your card .
SAUL: You take Visa ?
WAITER: I was acting on instructions from your business manager .
SAUL: My business manager ?
WAITER: Mr. Benedict .
BENEDICT: Look at it this wayEugene.if the album goes platinum it 'll cove what you owe . And if the second one goes gold , that should cover the interest .
LINUS: I 'm responsible for myself . I have my own life and my own plans . I 've never asked for anything but a fai shake . We make a deal , I stick to the deal .
DANNY: How many ca n't make the deadline ? Everyone raises their hands except Reuben .
REUBEN: So I 'm smarter than those schmucks on Wall Street . Whose fault is that ? Fair enough .
DANNY: How many think if they run , they 'll e found ?
RUSTY: We 're on the five o'clock .
DANNY: Good . A beat . DANNY Where ?
RUSTY: Amsterdam . Danny steps back .
DANNY: AMSTERDAM ! ?
RUSTY: FINE , THEN STAY HERE !
LIVINGSTON: Flight 144 to Amsterdam .
KLM AGENT: You 're in seat 43J . Enjoy you flight .
LIVINGSTON: Uhthere must be some mistake . I meanunlessis your first class section in the back of the plane ? The agent looks back at him , confused .
KLM AGENT: No .
SAUL: Fifty-five K ? There 's a fifty-five
KLM AGENT: We 've increased capacity by employing advanced design technology .
SAUL: You made the seats smaller . Can you just say that ? You made the seats smaller .
FRANK: See , you 're not hearing me . What I 'm trying to tell you is the eservations agent made a mistake when she issued the ticket , because on the rare occasions that I fly commercially , I always book a first- class ticket with no restrictions The desk agent looks back at him skeptically .
KLM AGENT: She may have , air , but this is the only ticket available to you on this flight . I need you to step aside so I can take care of the next customer .
FRANK: Now , listen Do n't make me get lack .
DANNY: Reuben .
REUBEN: I wanted to wish you luck . And listen I want to do something for you . Reuben hands Danny an envelope .
DANNY: What 's this ?
REUBEN: Take it . Take it . This is the least I can do . I 've got a friend who owns the Bellagio of Amsterdam and I 've made reservations for all of you there . It 's all taken care of .
RUSTY: That 's very touching , Reuben .
REUBEN: It 's the least I could do . I love you guys . Enjoy . Yen says something in Chinese . REUBEN No , thank you .
VIRGIL: Nice .
TURK: Great anticipation .
FLIGHT ATTENDANT: Gentlemen , you 'll have to go back to your seats now .
LINUS: Ground level . First floor . Day one . Planning stages . Planning stages .
LIVINGSTON: How 'd he get that seat ?
TURK: What seat ?
RUSTY: Call me an elitist asshole , call me a bourgeois clown , call me anything you want , but 'economy ' is ullshit .
DANNY: Oh , I do n't knowit 's not that ba-
LINUS: Hey . You guys have a minute ?
DANNY: Sure , Linus .
RUSTY: What 's on your mind ?
LINUS: Well , I know this may not be the exact right time to bring this up , ut I 've been thinking aboutwell , about where I want to e in five years , career-wise , and I 've decided I really want to be more than just a role-player . I eally see myself as kind of an idea man , like you guys . I mean , I know you do your part and you 're in the trenches with us and all , but it 's really your show , and like I said , five years from now , I want to be running my own show .
LINUS: So if there 's any opportunity fo me to be involved in the , you know , planning stages of things , I would eally appreciate it . I really feel like I 'm ready for more esponsibility and that I could eally make a contribution . Rusty turns to Danny .
RUSTY: Are you thinking what I 'm thinking ?
DANNY: Evelyn .
RUSTY: We 're negotiating the terms with her tomorrow . You feel up to taking the lead ?
LINUS: Are you serious ?
DANNY: Absolutely .
LINUS: This is n't some gag ?
RUSTY: No gag .
LINUS: Wow . Yeah . That would be awesome .
DANNY: Okay , then .
LINUS: Man . I was n't sure if I should say anything . Now I 'm glad I did .
DANNY: So are we .
RUSTY: We 're here to listen .
LINUS: Great . Thanks . Really . You wo n't egret this .
BASHER: Tom .
SAUL: He can be a Tom ?
BASHER: Anybody can be a Tom .
SAUL: You got ta make your own opportunities . This ai n't a ehearsal .
BASHER: Tom . Saul chews his economy class trail mix .
SAUL: Boy , you 're tough .
BASHER: Stop calling me `` boy '' . Saul stops chewing . They look at each other .
LIVINGSTON: How could he lie to us like that ?
RUSTY: The sign said 'the Bellagio of Amsterdam ' .
DANNY: Yeah .
LINUS: Look , you guys no frills , no perks , un-and-gun , all that stuff , and I said no problem because I believed you were right that we should n't go deeper into debt and spend money we do n't have . I mean , am I the only one who thinks this might actually e a good thing ? That we could use a little humility ? That maybe we were a little too pleased and impressed with ourselves after the Benedict job ? Okay , I grant you that maybe this is n't what we deserve , but maybe it 's what we need . We can do this . No , I take it ack We have to do this . A long beat .
TESS: What are you doing in Amsterdam ?
DANNY: How 's work ?
TESS: It 's the same . I 'm distracted .
DANNY: I 'm sorry .
TESS: It 's not your fault .
TESS: I 'll call you tomorrow . I love you .
DANNY: I love you .
RUSTY: She 'll try and use her looks to distract you . Do n't let her .
DANNY: Be polite , but firm .
LINUS: Right .
RUSTY: Do n't get soft on us . Do n't make too many concessions .
LINUS: I wo n't . Danny and Rusty nod . Okay .
EVELYN: The onset of summer is like a woman who owns too many shoes .
DANNY: If animals were capable of flattery , the World Bank would be open until 8pm .
EVELYN: When I was four years old , I saw my mother kill a spider with a tea cozy .
RUSTY: A doctor who specializes in skin diseases will dream that he has fallen asleep in front of the television . Later he will wake up in front of the television but not emember his dream .
LINUS: O let the sun beat down upon my face , stars to fill my dreams . I am a traveler of both time and space , to be where I have been .
EVELYN: Your young friend has a great deal to learn about respect .
DANNY: Linuswhy do n't you wait outside .
RUSTY: Her terms were scandalous . And we were lucky to get them after what you said .
DANNY: The deal was this close to being lown .
LINUS: `` Deal ? '' What `` deal ? '' Danny and Rusty just look at him . LINUS I know what you guys are doing . Danny and Rusty exhange looks . What ? LINUS Look . Thatperson had too many cupcakes . They just keep staring at him . LINUS I was playing along .
RUSTY: `` Playing along ! ''
DANNY: You called her mother a whore .
RUSTY: A really cheap one .
LINUS: Guys , I 'm not falling for this . I 'm not .
RUSTY: It 's a privately owned home . But do n't let that fool you . It 's extremely well-protected .
SAUL: What are we after ?
DANNY: A document . A very old , very valuable document .
VIRGIL: What is it ?
RUSTY: A stock certificate .
DANNY: The first one ever issued , from the first corporation on the planet . The Dutch East India Trading Company . It 's the only one of it 's kind and it 's worth a boat-load .
TURK: What 's our cut ?
RUSTY: 2.7 million after expenses . A beat . Turk seems confused
TURK: Each ?
VIRGIL: Who negotiated this ? Danny and Rusty look at Linus ,
LINUS: Thanks .
LIVINGSTON: What do we know so far ?
DANNY: There 's a dummy key pad by the front door . But the alarm is really controlled y the keypad in Mr. Vanderspeigle 's second floo office . Now , here 's good news we already know the system 's maste code . Evelyn gave it to us .
FRANK: That 's not good news , that 's really good news .
VIRGIL: We just wait until he leaves .
DANNY: Yeah , wellthat 's the bad news .
RUSTY: He does n't .
DANNY: He 's agoraphobic .
LIVINGSTON: So he 's never been out of his house ? Ever ?
TURK: Guys , am I missing something here ? We know his damn code , right ? You 're telling me with that much information we ca n't find a way into this freak 's house ?
SAUL: God , this guy really is a freak .
BASHER: Crazy freak .
DANNY: Something wrong ?
FRANK: Justdo n't call the guy a freak , okay ?
DANNY: Yeah .
LINUS: Okay , here 's somethingI 've got an ideasuppose we
RUSTY: No .
LINUS: Well , but how
RUSTY: There 's a Goldmann Grid over the enitre surface . Linus looks at him . RUSTY Is that what you were thinking about ? Linus nods .
DANNY: But .
RUSTY: Well , that 's different . Especially if we
DANNY: Right .
LINUS: What ?
RUSTY: A Schuman Special . Livingston
LIVINGSTON: Absolutely . I mean , I 'd need a day to
RUSTY: You 'll have three . Basher ?
BASHER: No worries .
RUSTY: Virgil , Turk .
TURK: Sweden .
RUSTY: Yen ? Yen says something in Chinese . RUSTY What , and give up show business ? Saul
SAUL: I know , I know . I 'll be bored . You 'll be fine .
RUSTY: Clock 's running .
LINUS: What 's a Schuman Special ?
LIVINGSTON: Your shot has to hit directly above the keypad .
BASHER: Let me see the specs .
SAUL: About 87 feet .
BASHER: How tall exactly ?
RUSTY: You 're not going to believe this .
DANNY: Try me .
RUSTY: We do n't have line-of-sight .
DANNY: What ?
RUSTY: We tried everywhere . Some places we 're only three or four inches offbutthere 's no straight shot . Even with Basher . It 's literally impossible .
LINUS: Can I talk to you guys for a second ?
DANNY: What ?
RUSTY: Jesus . This 'll kill us .
DANNY: Listen Do n't say anything . If you 're ever going to run your own crew , you 've got to remember to never show weakness .
RUSTY: It 's like blood in the water fo these guys .
DANNY: If they think you 're slipping , you wo n't even see it coming . Linus swallows .
RUSTY: But heythanks . Linus nods and goes back to the group .
DANNY: The Swinging Priest ?
RUSTY: Not enough time .
DANNY: Crazy Larry .
RUSTY: Too many variables .
DANNY: Robinov 's Revenge ?
RUSTY: Too many obstacles .
DANNY: The Soft Shoulder .
RUSTY: Not enough people .
DANNY: Baker 's Dozen .
RUSTY: We 'd need a woman .
DANNY: Hell in a Handbasket .
RUSTY: Ca n't train the cat that quickly .
DANNY: I ca n't have my wife watch me hauled off in handcuffs again .
RUSTY: It 's always about you , is n't it ?
DANNY: This like running toward a cliff . Speaking of which , how 's Isabel ?
RUSTY: I have no idea what you 're talking about .
DANNY: You get the tattoo removed ?
RUSTY: Given its location , my docto advised against it .
DANNY: What are you doing ?
RUSTY: We 're here .
DANNY: Oh .
SAUL: You want to do what ?
RUSTY: Tilt it . Raise it slightly .
SAUL: The whole house ?
RUSTY: It 's only a few inches .
BASHER: Then I 'll have line-of-sight .
FRANK: We ca n't tilt a whole house .
VIRGIL: They did it with the Leaning Towe of Pisa .
RUSTY: Exactly .
SAUL: It took three hundred guys two years to do that . You 're crazy . Nobody 's ever done anything like this .
RUSTY: Not true . Palowski did it in ` 64 in Venice and ` 73 in Istanbul .
SAUL: Really ?
LIVINGSTON: And he only had a crew of six .
RUSTY: There are thirty pylons . We cut them , insert the jacks , and crank .
BASHER: For nineteen hours . Here 's the order in which they have to be done .
LIVINGSTON: So , Basher approached me about eing on a crew .
FRANK: When ?
LIVINGSTON: Yesterday . Frank thinks about that .
RUSTY: The good news is , after the first twelve hours , I stopped being able to smell anything .
DANNY: Took a few more for me .
RUSTY: This water was stagnant six hundred years ago .
VIRGIL: There 's no reason for him not to . He would go to the cops .
TURK: Okay , so he goes to the cops .
VIRGIL: Then they arrest Dominique .
TURK: Right .
LINUS: She steals the money from Mr. Mulroney . They turn to look at Linus , sawing nearby .
TURK: What ?
VIRGIL: Why would she ?
LINUS: To pay Franklin to keep quiet .
TURK: That 's good .
SAUL: Counterfeiting ? Me ? I have to tell you , it 's not something I condone . It 's cheating .
BASHER: It is cheating .
SAUL: There 's no subtlety to it .
BASHER: It 's kind of embarrassing .
SAUL: No one I know
BASHER: I ca n't imagine anything like that .
SAUL: Not bad .
BASHER: Bolivia .
SAUL: Diego 's people ?
BASHER: Yeah .
SAUL: Well . Congratulations .
BASHER: I told him about you .
SAUL: I 'm too old . That 's dangerous . My stuff is cheap compared to that . It 's just me and my gal , you know . What you 're talking about is organized . But thanks , anyway .
FRANK: Jay Leno called .
LIVINGSTON: When are you gon na stop with that tired `` white people ca n't be funny stuff '' ? It 's so old , Frank , really . Do you want some orange juice ? I got the good kind .
FRANK: Bring that orange juice .
SAUL: This is Gatsby . We 're green here . Basher aims . The INSTANT he fires the shot we
ISABEL: Let 's discuss , briefly and to egin , with the category of `` thieves '' , as distinguished from the larger category of what might e termed `` hardened '' criminals . The highest level , `` maste thieves , '' if you will , is a very small world . Between six and ten high-level crews are operating in Europe at any given time . Worldwide , no more than twenty . The most famous , Gaspar LeMarc , is either dead or retired , and the expectation is that no one will eplace him . The good news is the trend is toward their extinction .
ISABEL: For example Anecdotal evidence suggest these people are personally insufferable .
ISABEL: That 's impossible !
PAUL: Thanks for coming . We can really use your help on this one .
ISABEL: I hope the scene has n't been contaminated .
PAUL: Not that we can find .
ISABEL: No , that would have triggered the system .
PAM: Well , then I do n't know how they got in .
ISABEL: They had to have known the code . She moves on to look in the mark 's BEDROOM .
PAUL: We considered that , but the mark swears that nobody in the world knew the code except him . He programmed the last seven steps of the system himself . He set it and never left the house again . When he dies , we 'll probably have to physically cut all the power lines to the house to get it off line .
ISABEL: There are other ways to get the code . Closed loop . Redundant servers . Titanium encasement . Not bad . The lead detective enters the bedroom .
PAUL: Like what ?
ISABEL: Uhwell , they probably set up in a house across the canal and watched him type the code in through a pair of binoculars .
PAUL: Actually , I do n't know about that . Isabel re-enters the office . PAUL Unless he had a habit of typing in the code like this
ISABEL: That 's why they probably set up over there
PAUL: What is it ?
ISABEL: It 's where the crossbow bolt hit .
PAUL: A crossbow bolt ?
ISABEL: Ever heard of Franz Schuman ?
PAUL: No .
ISABEL: They would have fired from that oof . Through this open window .
PAUL: From that roof , through this window ? Nobody could make a shot like that .
ISABEL: Not a cop , anyway .
PAUL: What 's that supposed to mean ?
ISABEL: Sorry . Your friend downstairs put me in a bad mood .
PAUL: He 's an idiot . You should n't let him bother you .
ISABEL: Yes . You 're right .
ISABEL: When did he get up and notice the certificate was gone ?
PAUL: The alarm woke him at 4 2O am .
ISABEL: But the alarm would have been She stops . And smiles to herself . ISABEL Oh Oh , I know what happened .
PAUL: What ?
ISABEL: There was someone else .
PAUL: Someone else .
DANNY: Wait ! Wait ! Shhhh !
DINNER JACKET: Can I help you ?
DANNY: Yeah . What the hell are you doing ?
DINNER JACKET: I am getting here first .
RUSTY: This is our score .
DINNER JACKET: I am here before you .
FRANK: We let you in the house ! Somehow you got in after we hit the code ut before we got to the door .
DINNER JACKET: That 's thirty seconds . How could I know which exact thirty seconds I had ? Unless I knew you plan . Could I have known your plan ? Do you have a snitch in your group ?
DANNY: No .
RUSTY: We do n't .
DINNER JACKET: Yes , I know you do n't . Because I saw , the whole thing from that chair . I knew you were around , ut I had my own plan . Yen says something in Chinese .
DINNER JACKET: There 's really no need for that .
DANNY: Listen , we have to come to some arrangement .
LINUS: We 've incurred some very serious costs here . Danny and Rusty look at him .
DINNER JACKET: Every second I am becoming more outnumbered .
VIRGIL: Who 's this ?
FRANK: He said he got here first .
VIRGIL: That 's bullshit .
RUSTY: Hey . Mouth .
VIRGIL: This is our goddamned job !
LIVINGSTON: If the situation were reversed
DINNER JACKET: But the situation is not reversed . The situation is that I am here first , without any help from you .
DINNER JACKET: So as much as I would Basher and Saul arrive .
DANNY: Just give us the stock certificate . Whatever else you took out of that safeit 's yours .
DINNER JACKET: No . But I leave you with something . He hands Danny a business card .
PAUL: Are you sure ?
ISABEL: I 'm sure there 's another scenario that would fit these physical details , but I do n't know what it is .
PAUL: Where should we start ?
ISABEL: You can start by picking that guy up .
VIRGIL: Who the hell was that guy ?
FRANK: It 's going to get out , you know . People are going to find out .
BASHER: Somebody must know this bloke 's name .
LIVINGSTON: The question is who trained him . He got into that place alone .
DANNY: He says .
FRANK: I believed him .
SAUL: You think he 's better than us ?
FRANK: I 'm not saying anything , but the man was sitting there , waiting fo us .
LINUS: Do you think the cops even know who this guys is ?
RUSTY: Please . That guy 's never even seen a cop .
TURK: Maybe he works with the cops .
SAUL: You do n't work with the cops unless you absolutely have to . And not even then .
BASHER: Either way , he 's got to have a name .
LIVINGSTON: It ca n't be that hard to find out who this guy is . Like I said , somebody trained him . Who trains the best ?
DANNY: LeMarc . Right ?
RUSTY: If he 's not dead .
LINUS: Who 's LeMarc ?
ONDERDONK: Fucking stone .
DAVENPECK: I 'm not quitting .
ONDERDONK: Who said quitting . I 'm tired .
ISABEL: Can I speak to him ? The two detectives look at each other .
DAVENPECK: Who are you ?
ONDERDONK: Are you moving him ?
ISABEL: Oh no . I just need to speak with him . To get some information .
DAVENPECK: We 've been on him for six hours .
ONDERDONK: With our best stuff .
DAVENPECK: Our best stuff . In mind terms , we 've been torturing this guy .
ISABEL: I 'm sure . I only need a moment , then I 'll be out of your way .
DANNY: Tess , I 've got to call you back .
RUSTY: Who is it ?
ISABEL: Hello , Robert . Rusty spins to see Isabel .
RUSTY: Isabel .
LINUS: `` Robert ? '' Is that his real name ? Virgil and Turk shrug .
LIVINGSTON: Ex-girlfriend .
RUSTY: It 's great to see you .
ISABEL: Is it ? Because you 've been seeing a lot of me lately . She hands a surveillance photo to Rusty .
ISABEL: You were hiding in the bushes when I had lunch yesterday at Trattoria Bella .
RUSTY: We did n't steal anything .
ISABEL: OhI know you did n't . Somebody eat you to it . One man . No crew . No back up . Tell me something just so I can get the full picture in my head was he wearing a tuxedo ? A white dinner jacket ?
BASHER: At least we saw him in the flesh . You 'll never see this guy you whole life .
ISABEL: So you know who he is ?
DANNY: Of course we know who he is .
ISABEL: Well , then . I 'll see you when you see him . To get your certificate ack .
LIVINGSTON: Who 's hat is that ?
SAUL: How did she That was
DANNY: This is what I was talking about . This is exactly what I was talking
RUSTY: I was just checking up on her . I knew she did n't want to see me . I was being polite .
TURK: Where did she learn all that stuff ? The Palowski stuff .
DANNY: Her father .
VIRGIL: He was a cop ?
RUSTY: Thief .
LINUS: Was he good ?
DANNY: Very .
FRANK: Great .
VIRGIL: What 's the big deal ? She 's just some brilliant , pissed-off ex- girlfriend who 's dad taught he every trick in the book .
TURK: But did you see that display of emotion , handing out those pictures ?
VIRGIL: Totally unprofessional .
RUSTY: She 's passionate .
VIRGIL: She 's unbalanced .
RUSTY: Her job is very stressful .
SAUL: She could reduce her stress by leaving us alone .
DANNY: We 've got to slow her down . Everyone agrees .
ISABEL'S BOSS: Twenty-four hours . You know that .
ISABEL: I do n't have twenty-four hours . They 're there now . They 'll lead me to him .
ISABEL'S BOSS: You also know that you can go now , if you do n't take your secretary . When there 's liability , I need a document . She nods .
HESS: He said we ca n't leave until tomorrow because of liability issues and he needs a document .
ISABEL: Yes .
HESS: Thanks for trying .
ISABEL: Let 's share a car .
HESS: That would be nice . Thank you .
ISABEL: I ca n't believe they wo n't make an exception . I 've got to find out who this othe guy is .
TOULOUR: Twenty minutes by helicopter .
BASHER: Scotland Yard said he 's the new LeMarc .
RUSTY: Scotland Yard never saw LeMarc .
TOULOUR: Please .
DANNY: What ?
RUSTY: Spit it out , Linus .
LINUS: He 's rarely alone . I think it 's a compulsion . I have a list of names hereit was just the first week .
DANNY: All right , moving on , is there anything else we need to know about this guy before we
BASHER: Did we forget to mention he 's a Viscount ?
DANNY: A what ?
LIVINGSTON: Viscount . As in nobility .
DANNY: Last time I checked titles like that went out with a little numbe I like to call the French Revolution
BASHER: Spain .
DANNY: What ?
BASHER: His title . It 's Spanish . Mother 's cousin .
DANNY: He may be the greatest thief in Europe . He may have slept with half of the EU . He may be a Casanova with the soul of a starving artist . It does n't matter .
EDMUNDS: Are you on steroids ? Toulour laughs .
EDMUND: Let 's try again . Give me five games this time .
TOULOUR: You are worse than Sampras . You should be paying me . A BUTLER arrives .
BUTLER: Pardon me , sir .
TOULOUR: Put them on the veranda and get them a drink . I 'll be right up .
DANNY: Other way around .
TOULOUR: Are you sure ? Usually I 'm so good at that . Edmund arrives , carrying his tennis bag .
DANNY: Nice to meet you . Edmund . You a tennis pro ? Rusty takes a sip of ice tea .
EDMUND: Actually , no , I 'm the King of Morocco . Danny and Rusty nod , their smiles frozen .
TOULOUR: Sadly , I ca n't show you my favorite painting of all a Degas that used to hang right there because it was stolen recently .
DANNY: That 's awful .
RUSTY: The criminal element is everywhere these days . Toulour nods .
DANNY: Listen , Francois
TOULOUR: Please . Call me Baron .
DANNY: We came here for the Vanderspeigle certificate
TOULOUR: That 's not for sale .
DANNY: Your Degas is worth three times that . You want your painting back , you 're going to have to trade .
TOULOUR: You actually expect me to believe that you are in possession of my Degas ? You are living in ain a ubble . Toulour looks at them and walks away .
BASHER: He used the word `` amateur '' ? Rusty and Danny nod reluctantly .
VIRGIL: You said we could show him the painting right , to prove that we had it .
DANNY: Yes .
RUSTY: He still would n't trade . Yen says something .
FRANK: We need to teach him a lesson .
TURK: Absolutely .
DANNY: All right , let 's stay calm . We do n't need to over-react here . He said some disrespectful things , that 's true . But why antagonize this guy ? Why get into something with him ? He 's young and he 's filthy rich , and he 's got time on his hands . We do n't want to become his Betty noir . We can just fence his painting and earn a lot more than we would have from the certificate .
BASHER: It 's about reputation . You said so yourself . We have to get that certificate to Evelyn 's buyer or
DANNY: We 'll make enough selling the Degas to pay off her buyer
FRANK: Then why did you make that trip down there in the first place , if you did n't want to get into something ?
DANNY: Saul ?
SAUL: Turn his name over to Isabel . In exchange for getting off our backs . Tough one to swallow .
TURK: We do n't even know our next job .
DANNY: We got ten million in that closet .
DANNY: I cash in the Degas , take a moment to think about our next move . Toulour is n't going anywhere . You guys are hyping him too much , you 're letting him get inside you head . Everyone agrees . Danny opens the closet .
ISABEL: Why do I need to see all these guys ? When I tracked the Munch down in Sweden I got all the approvals I needed with one phone call .
HESS: Without their signatures , you ca n't do anything . You ca n't pull the suspects over , you ca n't do surveillance on them , you 're not even allowed to contact them . They 're real sticklers about sovereignty issues here .
INSPECTOR: Isabel , I could n't possibly sign those documents in good conscience without talking to you about the case in detail . I realize you 're in a hurry and my schedule for the est of the day is quite full , so perhaps , if you 're interested in eing expedient , we could discuss the caseover dinner .
HESS: Foucquet 's at eight-thirty . Apparently their 's a private room . Better bring your kevlar . Do n't stop for that .
DANNY: That 's not how I want to go .
TOULOUR: No . They walk on .
DANNY: Why are you doing this to us ?
TOULOUR: Doing what ?
DANNY: This is a game for you . For us it 's survival . Are you that bored ? I mean
TOULOUR: No . I would n't do that . No The truth isI made a bet . Or maybe a etter word is a `` wager '' .
DANNY: What kind of wager ?
TOULOUR: A gentlemen 's wager with a friend of mine my mentor . A few months ago we were at his winter place in Nicaragua and another guest eferred to me as `` the greatest thief in the world . '' I did n't object , obviously , but my mento fell silent . Later I asked him about it . He said if I really wanted to say I was the best thiefI 'd have to prove I was etter than the eleven of you .
DANNY: 163 .
TOULOUR: Sorry . 163 . Before you were found .
DANNY: Here 's what I 'm going to do . You tell me the name of your mentor . I 'll call him up and I 'll tell him that you 're the greatest thief in the worldthat I accept that to e true . And in returnyou leave us alone , let us go about ou usiness . How about that ?
TOULOUR: He said you 'd probably say something like that but he said you 'd probably have your fingers crossed when you said it .
DANNY: This mentor of yourswas he a good thief in his day ?
TOULOUR: Who , LeMarc ?
DANNY: Yeah . Him .
LIVINGSTON: Who ? Yen says something .
RUSTY: I thought so too .
SAUL: LeMarc . The LeMarc . Danny nods .
FRANK: Hell , this could go on forever .
DANNY: No . It 's going to be settled by one more job . A single object .
SAUL: Whatever it is , let 's just let him have it .
DANNY: We ca n't .
LIVINGSTON: Because of pride ?
DANNY: Because we beat him , he 'll pay Benedict off . A stunned beat .
FRANK: Now we 're talking .
BASHER: One score , for the whole thing ?
LIVINGSTON: What do we have to do ? I mean , is it a fair bet or is it likethe Coronation Egg or something ? Danny points . That 's it . That 's the one .
SAUL: He wants us to steal the Coronation Egg !
BASHER: That 's just that'swhat is that ?
SAUL: The Holy Grail .
RUSTY: Carl Faberge , the greatest goldsmith in history , constructed the Coronation Egg in 1896 for the wedding of Czar Nicholas and Alexandra . Every world class thief in the last 108 years has tried to steal it . No one has even come close .
SAUL: That 's because it 's cursed .
LINUS: What ?
SAUL: It 's un-stealable .
DANNY: It 's the only thing in LeMarc 's entire career that he went afte ut failed to get . He tried three times . A long beat of silence .
BASHER: That 's great , except we ca n't get it .
SAUL: It 's not possible .
DANNY: Then we go to jail . A beat
VIRGIL: Wellwhere is it now ?
ISABEL: I 'm going to need surveillance on oth hotels , phone taps , room bugs , people in the lobby and by every exit .
CARABINIERI OFFICER: Yes , absolutely .
ISABEL: If I had to guess I 'd say I 'll need at least 25 people , a dozen vehiclesand an on-call air unit .
CARABINIERI OFFICER: Yes , absolutely .
ISABEL: Okay , one more thing , and this is crucial these guys are extremely , sophisticated at avoiding electronic surveillance , so we 'll need real state of the art stuff .
CARABINIERI OFFICER: Yes , absolutely .
ISABEL: Okay . Good . Now what time am I meeting Captain Giordano ? A beat
CARABINIERI OFFICER: Yes
ISABEL: No , what time ? Another beat
CARABINIERI OFFICER: Yesabsolutely Isabel looks right at him .
ISABEL: I seesoyou 've spoken with the Pope and he 's okay with autographing my breasts ? Hess turns around .
CARABINIERI OFFICER: Yes , absolutely .
DANNY: What am I looking at ?
LIVINGSTON: A TR354 infra red motion detection system . It 's the gold standard .
DANNY: Saul and Linus back yet ?
LIVINGSTON: No .
DANNY: No ?
LIVINGSTON: And I ca n't find Rusty .
FRANK: What ? Yen says something in Chinese , again .
DANNY: Seen Rusty ?
FRANK: We thought he was with you .
BASHER: Not since we first got here . About an hour ago . Danny moves away . BASHER And where 's Saul and Linus ?
ISABEL: Jesus , Robert . I could 've killed you .
RUSTY: I 'm older .
ISABEL: I hope so . What are you doing in my oom ?
RUSTY: I thought maybe we could get some coffee .
ISABEL: No , thanks .
RUSTY: Okay , how about a two week trip to Zanzibar ?
ISABEL: Please do n't .
RUSTY: Fine , coffee then . Whatever you say . Isabel gives an exasperated sigh .
ISABEL: Why do I want to have coffee with you ?
RUSTY: How should I know ? sorry about you mom . Isable nods . RUSTY She was a real
ISABEL: She hated you .
RUSTY: Well , she was nice enough to hide it from me . Some people ca n't even do that .
ISABEL: She hated everybody . Rusty nods . He remembers .
RUSTY: Get what ?
ISABEL: You 'll think you 've got it , you 'll e so close that you 'll be able to taste it and then this guy , the Night Fox or whoever he is , will just take it right out of you hand just like he did in Amsterdam . He 's as good as LeMarc .
RUSTY: It 's not possible .
ISABEL: You 're in a bubble .
FRANK: Look , if we 're having this much trouble , and we 've got ten guys Toulour must be pulling his hai out .
RUSTY: Would you call that bubble-shaped ?
DANNY: What ? Rusty shrugs it off .
RUSTY: She pulled a gun on me . He sits .
FRANK: Are you back on ?
RUSTY: I 'm selling . She ai n't buying .
DANNY: More importantly , what kind of eception is the Italian Police giving her ?
SUBORDINATE OFFICER: Captain Giordano is handling an urgent interrogation . He 'll be up as soon as it is completed . Please wait in here .
ISABEL: What are they talking about ?
SUBORDINATE OFFICER: It 's an internal matter , Madame . Isabel and Hess look at each other .
LIVINGSTON: Damn-it .
RUSTY: All right , okay . Let 's not be defeatists . What about that mirror trick that Akimbo tried at the
LIVINGSTON: There 's no mirror thin enough to avoid tripping the lasers .
DANNY: What 's he doing now ?
LINUS: We thought someone was following us .
SAUL: We gave 'em the shake . Caught 'em napping .
SUBORDINATE OFFICER: Captain Giordano , Rome Police Special Investigations . Isabel Lahiri , Europol , Major Theft Task Force .
ISABEL: reason to believe these men are going to try to steal the Coronation Egg when it is actually put on display next week . I need official authorization to surveil and pursue these suspected criminals on Italian soil .
CAPTAIN GIORDANO: Yes , absolutely .
ISABEL: And I 'll need substantial resources from your department . Can I count on that ?
CAPTAIN GIORDANO: Yes , absolutely . Isabel stops . Starts to wonder .
ISABEL: So , Captain , what do you think of my skirt ? He smiles and looks at her .
CAPTAIN GIORDANO: I think it 's very beautiful . Why , do n't you like it ?
TOULOUR: I do n't usually call for a second date . For you I make an exception .
DANNY: Thanks .
TOULOUR: I think it 's good that we talk . You see , you should stop following me . You 're wasting your time . I 'm going to let you go first and get caught . Then they will increase the security even more , and then I will steal the Egg . Then Lemarc can make his decision .
DANNY: You sound confident .
TOULOUR: Confident ? This is a very American word . I am arrogant . There 's a difference .
DANNY: Does n't matter if you 're that good . Are you that good ?
TOULOUR: I can move objects with my mind . Danny just looks at him .
DANNY: Do you ?
TOULOUR: Are you done stirring your sugar ?
DANNY: That 's fantastic . Listen , I appreciate the call , and , est of luck .
TOULOUR: Danny . I 'm serious . Sit down , please . Danny site down and looks at him .
DANNY: You 're telekinetic , is that what you 're telling me ?
TOULOUR: Yes . Butit 's a curse . A nightmare . Everything is too easy . But then LeMarc says I 'm still not the best . So I take his challenge . And you will fail , and I will win , and so what ? What does it prove ? What is he trying to show me ? Danny just looks at him .
CAPTAIN GIORDANO: Ms. Lahiri , you 're in Italy now . We are a sovereign nation . We 're not some adjunct , some administrative district of the EU . When Europol calls we do n't jump up and tap dance for you . If you want to work in Italy , then you have to do it under Italian authorityand that means you have to talk to Commander Andriottiwho , I 'm sure , will be happy to meet with you some time next week
ISABEL: Next week !
CAPTAIN GIORDANO: when he returns from vacation .
HESS: He said he has to get approval from someone else and they 're on sick leave .
ISABEL: Vacation .
HESS: Sorry I fell asleep .
ISABEL: We both did . I 'm exhausted .
ITALIAN DETECTIVE: I know the case , yes . Unfortunately , we did n't catch him .
ISABEL: Oh
RUSTY: Yes .
ISABEL: UmDid I ? I think I saw youyesterday .
RUSTY: Oh yeah ?
ISABEL: The police were chasing you .
RUSTY: You sure your eyes are n't broken ?
ISABEL: I 'm quite sure it was you .
RUSTY: Well , then I 'm not gon na argue . Can I buy you a coffee ?
ISABEL: Hello .
RUSTY: We 've got to stop meeting like this .
ISABEL: What are they talking about all the time ? !
RUSTY: Soccer . He does n't like Naples.thinks they 're a bunch ofsissies . Can I ask you a question ? Will you come to Zanzibar with me on Friday ?
ISABEL: Stop it .
LIVINGSTON: We did it ! It works !
DANNY: What , what happened ?
CAPTAIN GIORDANO: What 's that ?
ISABEL: An order signed by Commande Andriotti instructing you to `` provide any and all support that Agent Lahiri requests , whenever she equests it . '' He looks at it .
CAPTAIN GIORDANO: It 's good , yes . Okay . He looks at her .
LINUS: When Dominique goes back with Thomas to check the trunk , the money should n't be in the iefcase . Franklin should have double-crossed them .
VIRGIL: That could be a great moment , when he 's on the ground .
TURK: And you think Thomas is going to get blown up .
VIRGIL: Hey .
ISABEL: Another camera here and here . And have a guard here at all times so any attempt to disable the system will be detected . All your IR devices need to be fitted with eflective faces otherwise a UV later can be used to burn the sensors out .
LINUS: She just walked in there like Patton or something . She 's changingeverything and There were so many cops with her . I 've never seen so Danny plats up his hand to stop him .
LINUS: I do n't understand . If her fathe was a thiefwhy 's she such a hardass ? I mean you 'd think she 'd have a little sympathy for us .
RUSTY: When she was twelve her mother told her that her dad got arrested doing a job in Russia and died in jail . So I would n't count on much sympathy .
BASHER: `` This time it 's personal '' . Danny looks to Rusty , who nods .
ISABEL: What do you want ?
RUSTY: If he gets it , we 'll let you arrest us . If we get it , you come away with me to Zanzibar
ISABEL: What is your obsession with Zanzibar ? !
RUSTY: Do you want to make the bet or not ?
ISABEL: I 'm hanging up . Stop calling me .
LIVINGSTON: I 'm telling you , with everything she 's done in the last twenty-fou hoursunless you happen to be est friends with the head of security at the museum , unless you are someone he knows and trusts enough to leave alone in the gallery , after disabling about half of their security system , forget it . We are not stealing that egg
DANNY: `` Someone he knows . Someone he trusts . '' `` Someone he knows . ''
RUSTY: What about someone he does n't know ut trusts ?
DANNY: For instance ?
RUSTY: I 'm talking about you know who , who looks an awful lot like you know who Everyone looks at Danny .
DANNY: She might . It 's not going to be easy getting her over here .
BRUISER: Hiya , Tess . Just climb on through . Try not to look down too much .
REUBEN: There 's make-up in the bag there . And some photos . Do the best you can .
HOTEL MANAGER: Bonjourno . Yes . Yes . Ohoh , eally . Well , absolutely . We can haveI can make our presidential suite available . No , no , no . No trouble at all . We 'd love We 're honored that she 'd think of us
PRESS: Ms. Roberts ! Ms. Roberts ! Why did you come back to Rome so soon ! !
TESS: Iuh
PRESS: Was it to see Topher ?
TESS: To see what ?
PRESS: Topher Grace ! ! Your co-star ! ! Is that why you 're here ? !
TESS: Oh . No . I came to to see the
PRESS: Where 's Danny ?
TESS: What ?
PRESS: Danny , your husband ! !
TESS: Well , he 's not really
REUBEN: Ms. Roberts is very tired ! ! Please let her through ! Please !
TESS: I ca n't do this .
DANNY: Yes , you can .
TESS: I 'm not an actress , Danny ! And I do n't look like her !
DANNY: You do , Tess . You really do . I never told you that before , but it 's true .
TESS: Come on my
TESS: And my ears . Anybody who sees my ears is going to know instantly .
DANNY: Nobody 's looking at your ears .
TESS: Yes , Danny , they are . They 're going to know .
ISABEL: When did that happen ?
MUSEUM DIRECTOR: We just found out . I arranged a private showing for tomorrow morning before we open the show to the public .
ISABEL: I do n't understand , why do you have to disable any of the systems
MUSEUM DIRECTOR: Because she might want to get close to the egg , got right up here and look at it . And I 'm not going to embarrass myself or this institution by telling her she ca n't .
ISABEL: She 's an actress , Giovanni , not the Pope .
MUSEUM DIRECTOR: Do you realize how much free publicity we 'll get for this museum , just because she because she decided to come by and look at the egg ? She 's even agreed to do a photo shoot for us promoting the museum . Isabel gives an exasperated sigh .
ISABEL: That 's exactly the sort of thing
TURK: Where is he ?
VIRGIL: There . I took a look at the interrogation scene .
TURK: Why ?
VIRGIL: 'Cause Linus said it was epetitive .
TURK: It clarifies everything .
VIRGIL: He said it 's too on the nose .
TURK: What 's he , the head of the studio ? What 's he ever written ?
VIRGIL: He 's just saying Oh , no
TURK: What ?
VIRGIL: It 's not him !
TURK: What ! How did you You moron ! You said you were watching him the whole time !
VIRGIL: I was ! I mean , I used the bathroom once , but it was quick . You lost him yesterday ! They sit for a minute .
TURK: Livingston said Frank said that Rusty said that Danny said Toulou said do n't ever bother following him .
RUSTY: I 'm sorry .
ISABEL: What happened ?
RUSTY: I have to go . Right now . I have to leave the country . It could e a while . A month . Maybe more .
ISABEL: What are you saying ? What the hell are you saying ? Where are you going ?
RUSTY: I ca n't tell you . Isabel stares at his dark face .
ISABEL: When people start talking the way you 're talking there are only two possibilities you 're either in intelligence or you 're a criminal . And no one I work with has eve worked with youor even knows your name .
RUSTY: You knew what I was the day you met me , Isabel .
ISABEL: Robert
RUSTY: We can talk about it when I get ack .
ISABEL: No , Robert . I have to tell you something .
RUSTY: What is it ?
ISABEL: I 'm taking the job . I 'm moving to Amsterdam . He does n't respond for a moment .
RUSTY: I ca n't have this conversation ight now . Please , Isabel . I have to get out of here . I love you . He kisses her then leaves .
ISABEL: You want to walk ?
RUSTY: Who 's Julia ?
ISABEL: LeMarc knew when to get out . He just quitwith his perfect record intact . Now he 's a legend . Do n't do this .
RUSTY: LeMarc quit because he was 75 years old , Isabel . He was tired . His doctor told him if he did n't start taking it easy he was going to have another heart attack . You 're dramatizing it .
ISABEL: You do n't know why LeMarc retired , any better than I do . You have no idea .
RUSTY: Actually , I do . I know exactly why .
ISABEL: Really ? How 's that ?
RUSTY: He told me .
ISABEL: You know LeMarc ?
RUSTY: A little .
ISABEL: Since when ?
RUSTY: Ten years ago .
ISABEL: For how long ?
RUSTY: For six months .
ISABEL: You She 's so mad she can hardly speak .
RUSTY: I could n't tell you , then .
ISABEL: Really awful . Isabel thinks .
ISABEL: I do n't want to arrest you , Robert . I really do n't . But I will if you make me . I will if you go for that egg .
RUSTY: Isabel
ISABEL: I have to go .
REUBEN: You 're a photographer . Very exacting . You want things a certain way , but you never raise you voice . You 're uncompromising . Strong .
FRANK: Reuben , what are you doing ?
REUBEN: Oh , we understand each other . I 'm mean , the actual words are gibberish to me , but I know what he means . There 's a tone , you know . We communicate . I 'm sure he 'd tell you the same thing . Am I right ? Yen says something in Chinese .
TURK: I say we do a Joey Heatherton ,
VIRGIL: It 's the wrong color . Turk looks at his watch .
TURK: Damn .
TOPHER: Hello ? He knocks again .
TESS: Uh , no .
TOPHER: Oh . Hey . I saw the rough cut of YOU ALWAYS , YOU NEVER . It 's so awesome . Congratulations .
TESS: Oh . Thank you .
TOPHER: It was just like a dub of a lo-rez output , but I could totally see what you were doing . I think you might win again . Seriously .
TESS: Oh .
TOPHER: It really actually looked like you were blind . How did you do that ? What is it like , an on-set thing , or was it digital ?
TESS: It was , uh
TOPHER: You can tell me , I wo n't tell a soul . Because if you say it 's instinctual , I 'm quitting right now . Seriously . The way you parted your hair ? That was so connected . And that scene with the matches ? And when you find out who your real grandmother is and run through the ain and find her on the porch and touch her face ? Man , that wasyou got ta tell Steven how much I loved it .
TESS: Okay .
TOPHER: So what are you doing ?
TESS: I 'm , uh , getting ready to go out
TOPHER: I mean next . What movie are you doing next ?
TESS: II 'm having trouble deciding what to do next .
TOPHER: Is Danny working ?
TESS: DannyDanny isDanny is
TOPHER: Oh , no . Is something wrong ? Have you two
TESS: No , no
TOPHER: I 'm so sorry . I 'm so sorry .
TESS: No . we 're absolutely fine , he 's just

TESS: Thank you . He 's fine . Danny 's fine . He 's working .
TOPHER: Hey , cool , whatever . That 's what I 'll say . A beat .
REUBEN: My name is Stuart Feldman , Worldwide Executive Senior Vice- President of Marketing , Corporate Senior Vice-President of Publicity and Corporate International Executive Worldwide President of Promotion for the Warner Brothers Motion Picture company . My colleague , Grant Wells , who is esponsible for Ms. Roberts itinerary , has graciously set aside time for Ms. Roberts to view the Coronation Egg privately .
ISABEL: I want to be on record as saying that you should have shut the entire museum down .
TESS: It 's so beautiful . My God . Topher looks at the egg
TOPHER: Kinda small .
TOPHER: Hi .
TESS: I 'm not going to set off any alarms ?
MUSEUM DIRECTOR: No . No . Get as close as you like . Reuben pops his head in between them .
REUBEN: Julia unless you have any objections Wen and his crew set up for the publicity stills .
REUBEN: I was thinking maybe we could get you and Topher into some `` You Always You Never '' hats and t-shirts for the shoot
TESS: That 's stupid .
REUBEN: So stupid ! Idiot . Maybe we could put some posters in the background
TESS: I do n't think we want to be so obvious
REUBEN: I completely agree ! Stop trying to turn this into some sort of stunt .
ISABEL: This is n't going to work .
RUSTY: I do n't know what you 're talking about .
JULIA: Okay , thanks everybody . Thank you so much .
TOPHER: Hey , J Ro , why the quick exit ?
TESS: Iuh , I have to take some pills . Aspirin . I get headaches .
TOPHER: Yeah , well , with everything thing you 've been going through I can see how you 'd need something .
TESS: They 're just aspirin .
TOPHER: Right . I 've never taken aspirin in my life , ever . Can you believe that ?
TESS: That 's amazing .
TOPHER: For me , it 's like a control thing .
TESS: Well , with aspirinit 's very eneficial .
TOPHER: Oh , yeah . I 'm sure .
ISABEL: I am .
CAPTAIN GIORDANO: She is .
LINUS: What do you want ?
CLINT: Of course she did . We 're married , for God 's sake .
TESS: Why did n't you tell me ?
DANNY: I could n't .
TESS: Why not ?
DANNY: Because you 're not an actress . You would n't have been so real .
TESS: I thought you were going to jail .
DANNY: I 'm not going to jail . A beat .
TESS: So you do n't think I 'm a good actress .
DANNY: You 're a terrible liar .
TESS: I 'm a good liar .
DANNY: Where did Benedict find you ?
TESS: He
DANNY: At your parent 's house .
TESS: That wasokay , so I 'm not a good liar . So what . You 're good enough for both of us .
DANNY: Exactly .
ISABEL: What the Oh my God !
CAPTAIN GIORDANO: Yes , absolutely .
RUSTY: Guys . Get on there before they leave without you . Thanks .
CAPTAIN GIORDANO: Hey , no problem . Good seeing you , man .
ANDRIOTTI: Take care . See you back home .
RUSTY: Thanks , Scooter . Isabel is dumbstruck .
BUTLER: How was Rome , air ?
TOULOUR: Put this in the safe , would you ?
BUTLER: Of course , sir . Your guests are on the veranda .
TOULOUR: Guests ?
ISABEL: I hate you .
RUSTY: I love you .
ISABEL: This will ruin me .
RUSTY: No , it wo n't . Not if you come to Zanzibar .
ISABEL: What is it with Zanzibar ?
RUSTY: It 's where LeMarc is .
ISABEL: You 're asking me to turn my back on my whole life .
RUSTY: Would you miss it ?
ISABEL: I 'm a cop . That 's who I am .
RUSTY: You 're only a cop because you father was a thief .
ISABEL: Who died in a Russian jail .
RUSTY: According to you mother .
ISABEL: What does that mean ?
RUSTY: It means you should meet LeMarc .
TOULOUR: Let me guess , you decided you did want to give my lawyer a call . But you lost his card . Toulour holds out another card to Danny .
DANNY: No , nothing like that . We just came to collect our money .
TOULOUR: Not only did you fail , half of you crew got pinched ! Your plan was not good . And you do n't look anything like Julia Roberts ! I mean your and your and your ears .
TOULOUR: Oh , no . You stole it on the way to Rome did n't you ? I stole a replica .
LINUS: He 's completely drunk .
DANNY: What happened ? Linus puts his BACKPACK down .
LINUS: We thought someone was following us .
TOULOUR: But that means you knew what to steal before LeMarc proposed that I challenge you for it . That means
RUSTY: Gaspar , it 's Rusty . How are you ? And this time we see what be is working on
RUSTY: FINE , THEN STAY HERE !
TOULOUR: LeMarc told you . Of course .
DANNY: Well , we 'll be in touch to make all the arrangements .
TOULOUR: No . Do n't go . Please . Toulour gets up .
BASHER: So I think if you really analyze it , you can see that it 's inevitable . It 's time for us to evolve , en masse . I have to help ing that about whatever way I can , you know . Otherwise , the trajectory is fixed . You know what I 'm saying ?
SAUL: Mmm . Yes . But I 'm through evolving , I think . It 's too tiring . I feel pretty evolved . You know , considering .
TURK: I 've got an idea for anothe Dominique story .
VIRGIL: Can we finish this one first ?
TURK: Just let me tell it to you .
VIRGIL: No .
TURK: It 's like three sentences .
VIRGIL: I 'm serious ; you 're asking too much .
REUBEN: May I look at that when you 're through with it ?
LIVINGSTON: All in all , it was depressingly familiar . The forced camaraderie , the hollow smiles . Scared to take a moment 's reflection . Scared to imagine a different life . We ehaved like boys . But
LIVINGSTON: I 'm Livingston Dell . Thanks fo listening .
TESS: When do you want to go back ?
DANNY: Feel like traveling ?
TESS: Yeah . Do n't you ?
DANNY: Yeah .
TOULOUR: Tess . Danny . This is Monica Bellucci . And indeed it is .
MONICA: Hello .
TOULOUR: We 're thinking of taking a trip to the states . Take a look around . We 'd love to meet some of you friends while we 're there . Actually , one friend in particular .
RUSTY: There he is .
ISABEL: Gaspar ? That was my fa
BENEDICT: Yes .
REUBEN: So we 're clean ?
BENEDICT: You want it in writing ?
REUBEN: I 'll take your word .
BENEDICT: You 're clean .
REUBEN: These grudges , they 're awful . Nobody wine .
BENEDICT: As soon as someone retaliates , the situation is out of control .
REUBEN: This way , there 's no need fo etaliation . Why would there be ?
BENEDICT: There 's plenty for everyone .

SPIVEY: Well , according to the Warden at Pendleton , you were a disturbing influence on others . 'It appears that there is a potential in him for instigating a revolt among the other inmates . ' What do you think of that report ?
MCMURPHY: I do n't , Doc
SPIVEY: Arrested on an assault charge five times
MCMURPHY: That 's correct , Doc
SPIVEY: The doctor at the prison states 'Do n't overlook the possibility that this man may be faking psychosis to escape the drudgery of the work farm ' What do you say to that ?

BANCINI: Awful tired
BIG NURSE: At the close of Friday 's meeting , we were discussing Mister Harding 's problem , concerning his wife Mister Harding stated that his wife made him uneasy because she drew stares from men on the street . Is that correct , Mister Harding ?
HARDING: Yes , that 's perfectly correct .
BIG NURSE: He also thinks he may have given her reason to seek sexual attention elsewhere , but he did n't say how . He has been heard to say to his wife , ' I hate you , I do n't eve want to see you again . You 've etrayed me . ' So . Does anyone care to touch upon this further ? Big Nurse waits . A long beat .
MCMURPHY: Yeah , well , it just pains me somethin ' awful to see a full growed man sloshing around in his own water

BILLY: M-m-m-ma'am ?
BIG NURSE: Would you like to start ?
BILLY: N-n-n-n-n-no , ma'am .

MARTINI: No !
BIG NURSE: Mister Scanlon ? Scanlon looks at the floor .
HARDING: Yes , Miss Ratched , this is correct .
BIG NURSE: But you have no proof .
HARDING: No , Miss Ratched
BIG NURSE: And yet you suspect her .
HARDING: Yes , that is correct .
BIG NURSE: Why ?
HARDING: I can only speculate as to the easons why .
BIG NURSE: Have you ever speculated , Miste Harding , that you are impatient with your wife because she does not meet your mental requirements ? One of the Chronics laughs like a child .
HARDING: Miss Ratched . Given all the conditions of that sublime elationship , coupled with the subsequent annihilation of all that I held to be sacred , mentally , physically and emotionally , the only thing that I can speculate on , at this late date , is how I will justify the very existence of my life , with or without my dear wife .
SEFELT: What 's he talkin ' about ?
TABER: Yeah , Harding , why do n't you knockoff the bullshit and get to the point .
HARDING: The point is , I will carry on until I fully understand what the function of that relationship is egardless of form or content . Several hands go up .
BIG NURSE: Yes , Billy ?
BILLY: I-I-I-I-I d-d-do n't s-s-see how anyone could lu-lu-lu-love a man who t-t-t-talks the way he does .
TABER: Yeah , Harding , you 're so fuckin ' dumb I ca n't believe it .
HARDING: That 's a matter of opinion .
SEFELT: Yeah , Harding , where do you breathe anyway ?
FREDRICKSON: Through the ass .
HARDING: Is that your sense of humor or are you trying to say something ?
FREDRICKSON: Now what would I be trying to say ?
HARDING: I do n't know . I do n't know , but it makes me feel very peculiar when you throw in something like that .
FREDRICKSON: Peculiar ?
SEFELT: Why ?
TABER: Yeah , why ?
SCANLON: Yeah , tell us why .
HARDING: I hesitate to go on .
BIG NURSE: No secrets , Mister Harding . Let 's get it all out in the open
HARDING: I mean , the other day you made an allusion to my wife and the possible sexual problems we might e having . I know that to be the case , but the way in which you oached it , if that 's your idea of teaching me something
TABER: You know what , Harding ? I think you 're some kind of morbid asshole or something . You 've been talking about your wife evere since I can emember . You know , she 's on you mind and blah , blah , blah and on and on and when are you going to wise up and turn her loose !
FREDRICKSON: Yeah , wise up , Harding .
SEFELT: Yeah , turn her loose !
ACUTES: Yeah , who do you think you are anyway ? He thinks he 's God Almighty He 's a snob He 's a schmuck Dumbbell Creep Cretin Idiot Get rid of him Ship him upstairs
RUCKLY: Ffffffuck da wife
BANCINI: Tired Awful tired
ACUTES: Zap him Give 'im lobotomy Cut his nuts off He does n't have any Fag Pervert .
BANCINI: I 'm tired ! Everyone hushes .

WASHINGTON: You a good boy , Mistah Bancini

CHESWICK: Yeah
BIG NURSE: Good Now , as I recall , we were making quite a bit of headway , last time , with Mister Harding 's problem . So , does anyone care to begin ? McMurphy 's hand goes up . No one else 's does .
MCMURPHY: Right I 've been givin ' some serious consideration to what you told me about the democratic something of this therapeutic community of ours , an ' I got a few things I wan na get off my chest , efore we get back to Harding 's problem .
BIG NURSE: Certainly , Mister McMurphy .
MCMURPHY: Right !
SPIVEY: It is worth considering Miss Ratched ?
BIG NURSE: The point is well taken , Doctor , ut do we have the necessary personnel to cover a second day oom ?
SPIVEY: Well , since it will be largely the Chronics who remain here , one aide and one nurse should easily be able to handle any situation that might occur . What do you think , men , is it workable ?
CHESWICK: Right , Doc . It 's workable .
SPIVEY: Fine !
BIG NURSE: Good . Good . Yes , yes , I think we should give it a trial period . So ! May we get back to Mister Harding 's problem Yes , Mister McMurphy ?

MCMURPHY: The hell with the schedule , you can get back to the schedule next week when the series is over . What I want is a vote on it right now !
CHESWICK: I second the motion !

CHESWICK: No way .
BIG NURSE: Then I suggest we turn ou attention back to Mister Harding 's problem . Would anybody care to egin ? She looks around . McMurphy is slouched in his chair . Harding puts his hands up . No one else does .
HARDING: Yes , thank you , Miss Ratched . Since our last meeting I have been eflecting , quite seriously , on the nature of my problem . Naturally , I 'm referring to the capacity to obtain the necessary results in order to obtain No , no . To personify the very existence of that relationship regardless of the function Regardless of the function , we will confront the question of Yes . Yes . The question of Existence Relationship Function Confront Yes , confronting us in the moment of deepest crisis Yes , the crisis of our souls . Of our souls , which I am trying to fully understand the problem the problem . Not to shut ourselves off , but somehow Somehow to understand fully ou capacity to obtain to personify the question existence depends depends on the question to reflect to eflect

MCMURPHY: Come on , Doc , you know as well as I do what 's been comin ' down in that loony bin .
SPIVEY: Yes , well , Miss Ratched feels that you 're a disturbing influence on the other patients .
MCMURPHY: Shoot , Doc , the only one I 'm disturbing is that old nurse and her fixed ways . That 's all .
SPIVEY: Yes , that may be so , but in making a careful study of your past ecord , along with your behavio since you arrived here , my feeling is that you are not mentally ill and it is going to be my ecommendation that you be returned to Pendleton where they are bette equipped to handle your case . This is the kiss of death to McMurphy .

SPIVEY: I 'm afraid not .
MCMURPHY: Jesus , that old nurse sure wants my ass in a sling , do n't she !

PHAIBUN: He used to be a great boxer .

JENNA: I bet you do . But tell me Mai , before you started serving my son , how many cocks were you serving ? Was it over a thousand ? Mai stares at Jenna in disbelief .
JULIAN: Mum , stop it , for fuck 's sake .
JENNA: I 'm sorry Julian , but I wo n't stand by and let a dirty little hooker take advantage of my son in the vain hope that her womb is n't so diseased that she can trick him into impregnating he and putting another cocksucking child on to this earth .

JULIAN: Mum , do n't talk to her like that . Mai sits down .
JENNA: So what am I left with ? Julian stares at her .
JULIAN: Me .
JENNA: You 're right . We 're family . We stick together . But Billy was family too .
JULIAN: Billy was a fuck up He deserved everything he got . You know it and I know it .
JENNA: That 's it . I 'm not listening to this . I do n't ever want to hear you mention his name again Do you hear me ?
JULIAN: Yeah we were brothers , but we were neve close And he was only in Bangkok cause you could n't control him . So you sent him to me
JENNA: You could have protected him .
JULIAN: I did what I could . And that 's more than you ever did .
JENNA: I would 've done anything for him . Okay , he was n't born with as many advantages as you were . He struggled with things . But I always stood by him .
JULIAN: And what did that get him ? I 'll tell you what , a one way ticket to this fucking place , just like me .
JENNA: Do n't you dare blame me for what happened back then .
JULIAN: I 'm only here 'cause of you . If you did n't exist , I would n't be here . Beat .
JENNA: You would 've been a great fighter You could 've gone pro .
JULIAN: Do n't you think I know that ? And look at me now . I 'm a front for a drugs smuggling . He turns to Mai .
JENNA: At least you 're not behind bars and that 's more important to me .
JULIAN: That 's right Mum . That 's what 's more important to you . But what about me ? Sometimes I think you only got me out of there so the cops could n't trace it ack to you Jenna stares at him . Her face a mask .
JENNA: Surprise me .
JULIAN: 'Cause I 'm going to fight him . In the ing . Me versus him .
JENNA: Well that seems sensible And what do you hope that 's going to achieve ?
JULIAN: I do n't expect you to understand . Cause you do n't understand anything that is n't about you .
JENNA: And when you lose , what 's going to happen then ?
JULIAN: I do n't know But maybe this time I 'll win . Like you say , only God forgives . Maybe this time he 'll forgive me Jenna turns to Mai .
JENNA: Do you understand what he 's talking about ? 'Cause I have n't got a fucking a clue .
JULIAN: You never did , Mum .
JENNA: I hope you find what you 're looking for . 'Cause if you do n't , it 's going to find you and I 'm not always going to be there to look after you .

JENNA: We 'll have to something about that the , wont we ? But , first things first , what about Chang ?
GORDON: Who ?
JENNA: My son 's guardian angel .
GORDON: He 's just a retired cop
JENNA: Good , then he wo n't be to hard to kill , will he ?
GORDON: It 's not that simple Is there somewhere we can go that 's a little more private ? Beat . She raises her eyebrows .
JENNA: What did you have in mind ?
GORDON: You ca n't just going round killing cops here anymore . It 's not that easy .
JENNA: I did n't say it was easy . But then , you 're a resourceful man , are n't you ?
GORDON: I looked into it . Chang 's a hard man to get to . None of the Thais 'll go nea him
JENNA: Well then you 're going to have to find someone who 's not a fucking Thai then , are n't you ?
GORDON: There might be a way But Julian ca n't find out
JENNA: Do n't you worry about that . There are certain things that a mother and son should n't - and do n't - discuss
MAI: What are you doing ?
JULIAN: Seeing when it hurts . Mai watches him . He does n't flinch .
MAI: I 'm going to go .
JULIAN: Did n't you like what I got you ?
MAI: It 's fine , but you know It 's not my style .
JULIAN: What do you mean ?
MAI: Maybe you should give it to your mother .
JULIAN: Do n't to be so hard on her . Her life has n't been easy .
MAI: Come on Julian . She 's a fucking bitch .
JULIAN: Do n't say that , okay ? You do n't know what you 're talking about . She 'd do anything for me .
MAI: The way she talks to you
JULIAN: Do n't go there .
MAI: What ? 'Do n't talk about my mother ' ? Come on Julian . Julian stands up , angry .
JULIAN: You do n't get to judge her . You think she 's bad ? You should 've met my dad . But he 's not around anymore , and do you know why ? Cause she loved me too much . He lets go of her neck . Mai rubs her neck .
MAI: You 're fucked . He pulls money out of his pocket .
JULIAN: How much do I owe you ?
MAI: Fuck you .
YURI KARKOV: so why do you want to kill a policeman ? Policemen are good . They mind their own business and keep the streets safe . Stop people stealing my cars
JENNA: You really want to know ?
YURI KARKOV: Yes . It may effect the price .
JENNA: He killed my son .
YURI KARKOV: Revenge . Pricey
JENNA: This is Bangkok . Nothing 's that expensive .
YURI KARKOV: You 're right . Most things are cheap in Bangkok . Especially life We 'll take care of this business for you . But it wo n't be easy and it wo n't be cheap .
IN THAI: Do you want to die ? Do you want me to kill you ? For what you 've done ? A long pause . Finally
IN THAI: Tell me why not . Tell me why I should n't shoot you as soon as you come out of that door .
IN THAI: Not good enough .
IN THAI: I know that . You 're wearing sandals . Hitmen do n't wear sandals .
IN THAI: I 'm begging you . Please
IN THAI: You showed no mercy in there . Why should mercy be shown to you ?
IN THAI: I do n't know
IN THAI: Yes you do . A long beat .
IN THAI: I do n't know his name .
IN THAI: But you know where he is . Gunman Three looks up Nods .
IN THAI: You know why we 're here .
IN THAI: Yes
IN THAI: He set it up . He knows who ordered the hit . He 'll tell you .
IN THAI: Do n't talk unless I ask you to . Understood ?
IN THAI: Yes . Completely understood . Chang turns to Li Po .
IN THAI: Do you have anything to say fo yourself ?
IN THAI: I 'm a salesman . Some of the things I sell are n't exactly legal But I 'll give you the man that hired the hit Chang stares at him
IN THAI: Good
IN THAI: As for myself , I 'm not scared of paying for what I 've done . I just just do n't hurt my son .
IN THAI: You see ? He knows . He 's got the details . I told you he would .
IN THAI: And I told you not to talk unless I asked you . Chang aims his gun at Gunman Three .
IN THAI: Wait . You said if I took you to him you 'd let me live . Chang shakes his head .
IN THAI: I never said that .
IN THAI: Skylight bar at the Jupiter.. Every night .
IN THAI: I 'm taking your phone . Chang turns to leave .
IN THAI: What about me ?
IN THAI: I forgive you
YURI: You better have a fucking good reason for doing this . Do n't you know who you 're fucking with . Chang looks at him .
IN THAI: You live in my country . Ca n't speak my language Too bad the one guy on my team that could speak English got murdered today .
YURI: Can someone tell me what the fuck this guy 's trying to say Chang calls over to the barman .
IN THAI: Can you turn the music off . It wo n't e long , I promise . The music 's killed .
IN ENGLISH: You 're under arrest
DIMITRI: It was an English woman - she wanted you dead A beat . Not what Chang expected
CHANG: Why ?
DIMITRI: Said you murdered her son .
CHANG: Who was she ?
DIMITRI: I do n't know
CHANG: How did she know me ?
DIMITRI: She asked for you by name
CHANG: And what 's my name ?
IN THAI: I see the way you look at my people . The way you abuse them with your eyes . For this , I take your sight .
NADEE: I hope life treats you kind And I hope you have all you 've dreamed of And I wish you , joy and happiness .
CHANG: But above all this , I wish you love . And I will always love you .
IN THAI: Fight .
JULIAN: Come on .

CHANG: It was n't you , was it ? Julian shrugs , puts his guard up .
JULIAN: What are you talking about ?
CHANG: It 's not your fault .
JENNA: He does n't want to see anyone .
MAI: tell him I came ?
JENNA: Of course . Jenna hugs Mai close .
JULIAN: Give it a break mum . Just give it as rest .
JENNA: I 'll never get use to seeing you get hurt - even when you win .

JULIAN: We 'll be okay - I 'll do it , I 'll take him out
JENNA: Not just him . We 've got to take them all out .
IN THAI: What happened to the princess ' head ?
IN THAI: The monsters were angry . They bit it off .
IN THAI: I thought the King banished them all from his kingdom ?
IN THAI: These were new monsters . The woods are full of them .
IN THAI: Nothing 's wrong . Go to sleep .
IN THAI: They 're going to come after me Okay . Good .

CONRAD: I did n't lie !

CALVIN: Connie ! Now , Connie ! Connie !
CONRAD: Cos the only reason she cares , the only reason she gives a fuck about it
CALVIN: Connie !
CONRAD: is because someone else knew about it first !
CALVIN: Just stop it , Connie !
CONRAD: No ! You tell her to stop it ! You never tell her a godamn thing ! And I know why she never came to the hospital , she 's busy going to goddamn Spain and goddamn Portugal ! Why should she care if I 'm hung up by the balls out there ?
BETH: Maybe this is how they sit around and talk at the hospital , but we 're not at the hospital now .
CONRAD: You never came to the hospital !
CALVIN: How do you know she never came ? You know she came but she had the flu and could n't come inside , but she came .
CONRAD: Yeah ! She would n't have had any flu if Buck was in the hospital ! She would have come if Buck was in the hospital !
BETH: Buck never would 've been in the hospital !
CALVIN: That 's enough ! That is enough !
BETH: I wo n't do it again . I really wo n't do it .
CALVIN: What in hell has happened ?
BETH: Ah ! Oh , god , that 's the pattern , is n't it ? He walks all over us and then you go up and apologize to him .
CALVIN: I am not going to apologize
BETH: Yes of course you are ! You always do ! You 've been apologizing to him ever since he got home from the hospital , only you do n't see it !
CALVIN: I am not apologizing . I 'm trying to goddamn understand him !

CALVIN: Why do n't you tell her ?
CONRAD: Oh , God , no , I ca n't ! Do n't you see ? I ca n't talk to her !
CALVIN: Why not ?
CONRAD: Ha ! Because it does n't change anything . It does n't change the way she looks at me .
CALVIN: She was upset , Conrad . Your mothe was hurt because you quit the swim team . I do n't understand it myself .

DR BERGER: Tuesday you felt great . You bought a Christmas tree , it was all hunky- dory . Okay ?
CONRAD: You 're the doctor .
DR BERGER: Do n't take refuge in one-liners like `` You 're the doctor '' . Okay ? Because that pisses me off .

CONRAD: Hey , come on , if you Listen , I 'm never gon na be forgiven fo that . Never ! You know , you ca n't get it out , you know , all the blood in her towels , in her rug . Everything had to be pitched . Even the tiles in the bathroom had to be regrouted . Christ , she fired the godamn maid because she could n't dust the living room ight . If you think I 'm gon na forgive - that she 's gon na forgive me
DR BERGER: What ?
CONRAD: I think I just figured something out .
DR BERGER: What ?
CONRAD: Who it is who ca n't forgive who
DR BERGER: Well a real problem a real problem has a real solution .
CONRAD: I 've heard this all before .
DR BERGER: Does n't make it any less true .
CONRAD: I 'm so tired .
DR BERGER: Yeah , well that 's a hell of a secret you 've been keeping on yourself .
CONRAD: So what do I do now ?
DR BERGER: Recognize her limitations .
CONRAD: You mean , like she ca n't love me ?
DR BERGER: Oh , kiddo , no . Like she ca n't love you enough . Like do n't blame he for not loving you more than she 's able .
CONRAD: But she loves my father . I know she loved my brother . It 's me !
DR BERGER: Ha ! Now we 're back to the rotten kid routine ! She ca n't love you ecause you 're unlovable . Where does that leave your dad ? How come he loves you ? You 're a rottenkid , does n't he know that ?
CONRAD: That 's different . He feels esponsible . Besides , he loves everybody .
DR BERGER: Ho , I get it ! The guy 's got no taste ! He loves you , but he 's wrong . Look maybe she just ca n't express it the way you 'd like he to . Maybe she 's just afraid to show you what she feels .
CONRAD: What do you mean ?
DR BERGER: I mean there 's someone besides you mother you 've got to forgive .
CONRAD: You mean me ?
DR BERGER: Why do n't you give yourself a eak ? Let yourself off the hook ?
CONRAD: What did I do ?
DR BERGER: We 'll talk about it on Thursday .

DR BERGER: Come on , Con . You know the rules .
CONRAD: Rules ? What rules ? Ca n't I have a few minutes ?

CONRAD: Jesus !
FRIEND: Say . After going to a new high , it falls to 112 1/4 and then rallies on good volume . I shoot an order to uy 4000 at the market . If I get the 4000 shares at 113 3/4 , I know something 's wrong .
CALVIN: OK .
FRIEND: I 'll see you , Cal .
CALVIN: See you later .
FRIEND: Suppose the order to buy 4000 at
BETH: He walks all over us and you go up there and apologize to him
FRIEND: 500 at 114
CONRAD: It 's all German pudding with you , dad , you do n't see things .
BETH: You 've been apologizing to him eve since he came home from the hospital . And you just do n't see that !
CONRAD: Tell her to stop it ! You never tell her a godamn thing !
BETH: Buck never would have been in the hospital !
CONRAD: She hates me ! Ca n't you see that ?
CALVIN: I want to be clear .
DR BERGER: That 's good .
CALVIN: In the car , I was thinking `` be clear. '' . I suppose that 's what psychiatry 's about . Being precise and clear . And honest , of course . I 'll level with you . I 'm not a great believer in psychiatry .
DR BERGER: Okay .
CALVIN: I know what happens here is only etween you and him , andI like that , I respect that . Andhe 's better , I can see that . I am not trying to put you down , I just do n't believe in psychiatry as a panacea fo everybody .
DR BERGER: Neither do I .
CALVIN: I wish I knew what the hell I was doing here .
DR BERGER: Well , you said you thought you could shed some light on some things . What did you mean by that ?
CALVIN: I do n't know actually , I 'm not sure , I think I meant in terms of Conrad . You see , I knew something was wrong even before he tried to to kill himself . But I thought that It 's clear that he 's very smart . He 's been an `` A '' student ever since he started school , and naturally I thought that intelligent people could work out their own problems .
DR BERGER: But you still feel responsible ?
CALVIN: Yeah , sure I do . It 's hard not to . It was luck . It was just luck that I happened to be there when he tried it . I could have been at a meeting . We both could 've been away . It was luck !
DR BERGER: You think of yourself as a lucky man , then ?
CALVIN: No ! No . No . I used to . I used to think that I was a lucky person efore the `` accident '' . Mmm , I guess the whole of life is nothing but an accident , is it ? What happens to you . I should do with it .
DR BERGER: That sounds more like the philosophy of a drifter than a tax attorney .
CALVIN: Yeah . Maybe , maybe I am drifting a little . I can see myself , and I can see the two of them drifting away from me , and I just stand there watching .
DR BERGER: What would you want to do about that ?
CALVIN: Something . I got ta do something about it . I do n't know what .
DR BERGER: And you see them as on opposite sides of this fence ?
CALVIN: Yeah No . I do n't know . I see he not being able to forgive him .
DR BERGER: For what ?
CALVIN: Oh , I do n't know exactly . Being too much like her . People always think that she and Buck are were were alike . But it 's really she and Conrad . They were the only two that did n't cry at the funeral , you know ? It 's not easy for me to admit this but , uh she did n't His mother does n't show him a great deal of affection . I 'm not trying to put her down in any way at all . She is a wonderful woman , huh
DR BERGER: Did she give Buck much affection to Buck ?
CALVIN: Oh , god , yes , she loved Buck ! Bucky got so much I think what she felt for him was special . You know , he was her first-born . That 's not unusual , is it ?
DR BERGER: And you ?
CALVIN: Me ? I loved Buck .
DR BERGER: What I mean is , your wife 's affection .
CALVIN: For me you mean ?
DR BERGER: Yes .
CALVIN: Mmm . She 's very No . There 's no problem with her for me . We 've een We 've been married nearly twenty one years . Everybody loves Beth . But , huh for Conrad , - it 's been difficult . He did n't talk about that ? We do n't know what happens here . It does n't come up . I guess that 's what it is . It 's private here . Is n't it ?
DR BERGER: Mm-hmm . Very private .
CALVIN: I think I know why I came here . I think I came here to talk about myself .
DR BERGER: Okay . Why do n't we ?
BETH: Hi !
CALVIN: This will sound strange .
BETH: What happened ?
CALVIN: Could we talk about Buck 's funeral ?
BETH: What ?
CALVIN: I know it 'll seem trivial , but it 's on my mind , or has been , and I 'd just like to talk about it .
BETH: Why ?
CALVIN: When I was getting dressed fo Buck 's funeral , I was
BETH: Calvin , what 's the matter with you ?
CALVIN: Just let me get it off my chest , OK ?
BETH: What could getting dressed fo Buck 's funeral possibly have to do with anything right now ?
CALVIN: I was wearing a blue shirt . And you said - Wear a white shirt and the other shoes ! It was nothing at the time . But it 's always seemed to stay with me . And I , for some reason , been thinking about it and it suddenly occured to me what difference did it make what I wore at Buck 's funeral ?
BETH: Ha , ha .
CALVIN: Just hear me out , Beth ! It wo n't hurt you to listen !
BETH: I wo n't listen to that ! No one in their right mind would listen to that .
CALVIN: I just want to talk about something I always remembered .
BETH: Why do you want to remind me of it ?
CALVIN: Because I 've always wondered , in some needling way , what it mattered what I wore . I was crazy that day . We were going to our son 's funeral . And you were worried about what I wore on my feet . I 'm sure it sounds like nothing to you , but it sticks with me and I just wanted to tell you about it .
BETH: It 's all right .
CAROLL: Beth ! Beth ! Hi ! How are you ?
BETH: Caroll ! I 'm fine . How are you ?
CAROLL: I have n't seen you !
BETH: I know . I 'm so busy . I promise I 'll call you soon and we 'll have lunch .
CAROLL: Right !
BETH: How 's Brad ? Give him my love .
CAROLL: Fabulous ! Is everything okay ?
BETH: Is n't this madness ? It gets worse every year !
CAROLL: Good-bye !
SALESWOMAN: May I show you this in your size ?
BETH: What ?
SALESWOMAN: May I show you this dress in you size ?
BETH: Oh No , no . No . Thanks .
CALVIN: I do n't think so . I think we should go see him , Beth . - Dr. Berger .
BETH: What ?
CALVIN: I think we could all go and see him together .
BETH: Why ?
CALVIN: He thinks it 's a good idea .
BETH: Ho He thinks it 's a good idea ? What does he know about me , about this family ? I 've never even met him .
CALVIN: Exactly . That 's the point . Would n't it be easier if we all talked about it ? In the open .
BETH: About what ? What are we gon na talk about ? Do n't try to change me , Calvin . I do n't want anymore changes in my life . For God 's sake , has n't enough happened ? Let 's just hold on to what we 've got !
CALVIN: Darling , that is what this is for . Maybe you 'll get a surprise .
BETH: I do n't want any surprises . I know I 'm not perfect . And if I ca n't go around hugging everybody all the time the way you do , then I 'm sorry .
CALVIN: I am not asking you to be perfect , you 're missing the point .
BETH: I do n't want to see any doctors o counselors . I am me . This is my family . And if we have problems , then we will solve those problems in the privacy of our own home , not y running to some kind of specialist everytime something goes wrong
WAITRESS: Are you folks ready to order ?

CALVIN: Pinehurst would be nice . I think Connie would like Pinehurst .
BETH: Do you do that deliberately or is it just a reflex ?
CALVIN: Well , you said `` vacation '' , so I just assumed you meant him too .
BETH: I 'm surprised you have n't felt the need to call him since we 've been here .
CALVIN: I was gon na call him tonight .
BETH: Hey , could we have a little drink efore we head back ?
WARD: Drink , yes . Little , no . What 'd you get ? Cal , what 'd you get ?
CALVIN: Six . Let 's finish this .
BETH: What ?
CALVIN: What you started .
BETH: What I started ?
CALVIN: What you started .
BETH: Ha ! There 's no point discussing it .
CALVIN: I think there is a point .
BETH: He controls you even when you are two thousand miles away .
CALVIN: He is n't the problem .
BETH: Is n't he ?
CALVIN: No , he is n't . Let 's talk about what 's really bothering you .
BETH: No , no . Let 's talk about what 's othering you . Cos ' that 's what you want , is n't it ?
CALVIN: Jesus , what have I done to make you so angry with me ?
BETH: It 's not what you 've done , it 's what you think I 've done . You blame me for the whole thing .
CALVIN: Ca n't you see anything except in terms of how it affects you ?
BETH: No ! I ca n't ! And neither can you , and neither can anybody else ! Only maybe I 'm just a little more honest about it !
CALVIN: Well , stop being so godamn honest , and start being a little generous ! And start thinking about him fo a while !
BETH: I do n't know what he expects from me . I never have known .
CALVIN: Well , I 'll tell you what he expects !
BETH: What ? He wants me to throw my arms around him everytime he passes an exam ? Well , I ca n't do it ! I can not respond when someone says `` Here , I just did this great thing . Love me. '' . I ca n't !
CALVIN: All he wants All he wants is to know you do n't hate him . That 's it .
BETH: Hate him ? My God ! How could I hate him ? Mothers do n't hate thei sons ! Is that what he told you ? Do you see how you accept what he says with no questions , and you ca n't do the same thing to me , can you ?
CALVIN: I just try to keep this family together
BETH: I do n't know what everyone wants from me anymore !
AUDREY: Beth , nobody wants anything from you .
WARD: Beth , listen . We all just want Cal , Con , everybody , we just want you to be happy .

BETH: Calvin ?
CALVIN: I do n't
BETH: What did you say ?
CALVIN: You are beautiful . And you are unpredictable . But you 're so cautious . You 're determined , Beth . But you know something ? You 're not strong . And I do n't know if you 're eally giving . Beth is looking at him not knowing what this is about .
BETH: I feel the way I 've always felt about you .
CALVIN: We would 've been all right , if there had n't been any mess . But you ca n't handle mess . You need everything neat and easy . I do n't know . Maybe you ca n't love anybody . It was so much Buck . And Buck died , it was as if you buried all your love with him , and I do n't understand that . I just do n't know .

CALVIN: No .
CONRAD: Yeah , it is . It 's my fault .
CALVIN: Do n't do that ! Do n't do that to yourself ! It 's nobody 's fault ! Things happen in this world , people do n't always have answers for them , you know .
CONRAD: No , that 's right ! You 're right ! You ought to do that more often .
CALVIN: Oh , yeah ?
CONRAD: Yeah , yeah , Haul my ass a little , you know . Get after me . The way you used to for him .
CALVIN: Oh , he needed it . You did n't . You were always so hard on yourself , I never had the heart .
CONRAD: Oh , Dad . Do n't .
CALVIN: No , it 's the truth . I I neve worried about you . I just was n't listening .
CONRAD: Well , I was n't putting out many signals then . I do n't think you could have done anything .
CALVIN: No , no , no , I should I should 've got a handle on it somehow .
CONRAD: You know , I used to figure you had a handle for everything . You knew it all .
CALVIN: Well , do n't admire people too much . They 'll disappoint you sometimes .

SHIRLEY: We sure picked the wrong night to find a cemetery . Let 's turn ack .
BOB: No . It 's on a night like this when the best ideas come to mind .
SHIRLEY: But does it have to be in a cemetery ?
BOB: You would n't understand . Seeing a cemetery on a night like this can stir in the mind the best ideas for a good horror story .
SHIRLEY: But there 're so many wonderful things to write about , Bob .
BOB: Sure there areand I 've tried them all . Plays , love stories , westerns , dog stories . Huh , now there was a good one , that dog story all about
SHIRLEY: But horror stories ! Why all the time horror stories ?
BOB: Shirley , I wrote for years without selling a single word .
SHIRLEY: That 's life . My kisses are alive .
BOB: Who 's to say my monsters are n't alive ? LONG SHOT of the car driving down the road CUT back to MEDIUM SHOT of Bob and Shirley
SHIRLEY: Well , fact or not , I do n't see how we 're going to find an ancient cemetery in these mountains tonight . I ca n't see a thing ! Let 's turn back .
BOB: There 's an old cemetery on this road . I 've been there efore .
SHIRLEY: I 'm getting the jitters ! Let 's turn back !
BOB: Okay .
SHIRLEY: Not so fast !
CRISWELL: The day is gone , the night is upon us , and the moon , which controls all of the underworld , once again shinesin radiant contentment . Come forth , come forth , o Princess of Darkness .
SHIRLEY: I 'm so frightened .
BOB: Well we certainly ca n't stay here . C'mon .
SHIRLEY: Where ?
BOB: In there .
SHIRLEY: It frightens me .
BOB: Silly , there 's nothing in there to be afraid of .
SHIRLEY: Then..then what 's that music ?
BOB: That 's what I want to find out . We have to get help .
SHIRLEY: What help can we possibly find in the cemetery at this time of night ?
BOB: Something 's making that music .
SHIRLEY: I 'm not sure I care to find out what it is .
BOB: All right . Do n't worry , I 'll e right beside you .
SHIRLEY: What help will that do if something in there is n't dead ?
BOB: Not dead ? In a cemetery ?
SHIRLEY: I ca n't imagine anything dead playing that music .
BOB: Well , it 's probably just the caretaker , and that 's exactly who we want to find . They 'll have a telephone . C'mon .
SHIRLEY: Could it be some kind of college initiation ?
BOB: It 's an initiation all right , ut not of a college as you and I know them . Nothing alive looks like that !
SHIRLEY: Ca n't we get out of here ?
BOB: I 'm not sure
SHIRLEY: What do you mean ?
BOB: I 'm not sure , myself . It 's just a feeling I 've had since the crashLike I feel a cold chill all over.. ..Now this !
CRISWELL: I would see for approval , the one who in life worshipped gold above all else .
SHIRLEY: Look !
BOB: Be careful ! They 'll see you .
CRISWELL: Throw gold at her .
THE MUMMY: Yes , Master .
CRISWELL: Live ones where only the dead should be ?
THE MUMMY: Yes , Master , and we caught them , him and me .
CRISWELL: You shall both be rewarded . My Dear Empress of the Night , put these intruders to the test .
SHIRLEY: Fiend ! Fiend !
CRISWELL: A pussycat is born to be whipped . The Cat Girl Dance ends .
SHIRLEY: I 'm so frightened .
BOB: You 've got a right to be . We 're trapped by a bunch of fiends .
SHIRLEY: Those creatures.. !
BOB: Do n't let them hear you .
SHIRLEY: What can we do ?
BOB: I do n't know . I just do n't know . But do n't give up . We 're not finished yet . Shirley closes her eyes and sighs .
SHIRLEY: I 'm afraid I 'll faint .
BOB: Whatever you do , do n't do that .
CRISWELL: HOLD !
THE MUMMY: I do n't like snakes . I remembe the one Cleopatra used . Cute little rascal until it flicked out that red tongue , and those two sharp fangs . You 'd neve think such a little thing packed such a big wallop .
CRISWELL: She pleases me . Permit her to live in the World of the Snakes .
THE MUMMY: He wants us .
CRISWELL: Of course you are .
THE MUMMY: Have we in some way made you angry , Master ?
CRISWELL: You know better than that .
THE MUMMY: We do n't know of anything , Master
CRISWELL: Then why do you shake so ?
THE MUMMY: It 's not often an Empero like you calls on creatures like us .
CRISWELL: Well rest easy , I 'm not angry with either of you .
THE MUMMY: Aaaahhhh .
CRISWELL: You are the keepers of the Damned . You two know them all . And I am tired of this usual type of entertainment . I wanta decided change .
THE MUMMY: There are one or two which should complement the night 's entertainment , Maste
CRISWELL: Ahh , good . Then I will see them . Dismiss the rest .
THE MUMMY: Yes , sir , Master .
BOB: The ropes are coming loose .
SHIRLEY: Be careful !
BOB: I amIt 's our only chance .
SHIRLEY: Nothing is worth your life .
BOB: My guess is if we do n't take the chance pretty soon , we 're not going to have much life left anyway .
SHIRLEY: I 'm frightened . I 'm so frightened .
BOB: Hold on just a little longer , Shirley .
SHIRLEY: Be careful , oh please be careful . We 'll never get out of here alive , I know it . I just feel it .
BOB: You do ?
SHIRLEY: Yes I feel it in my bones .
BOB: You 're talking nonsense .
SHIRLEY: Oh , no I 'm not . These heathens probably have an open grave for us .
BOB: They would n't dare put us in the same grave
SHIRLEY: I should hope not . I hate you !
BOB: That sudden ?
SHIRLEY: Yes , that sudden . If it were n't for you we would n't be hunting for an old cemetery on a night like this . It 's all your fault .
BOB: And I thought you loved me .
CRISWELL: Not yet . I perhaps have othe plans for such a pretty one . No matter , I will tell you when and if you may have her .
SHIRLEY: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA .
CRISWELL: I have promised both The Wolf Man and The Mummy a eward . It could be that
SHIRLEY: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA .
CRISWELL: You need not worryNot just now , anyway .
BOB: Leave her alone , you fiend !
CRISWELL: Fiend is it ! You will not e so fortunate . You existence will cease within moments . No one wishes to see a man dance And you , my dear , will entertain for centuries to come .

BOB: Leave her alone , I tell you !
CRISWELL: I do not joke in my proposal .
SHIRLEY: No . No ! No !
CRISWELL: I repulse you ? Very well . It seems you have chosen your own fate . Live with it ! I should say die with it !
BOB: I 've got the ropes loose now . I 've got my hands free . Be carefulDo n't change you expression too much . They must not catch on .
SHIRLEY: What can we do against them ?
BOB: I do n't know , yet . We 'll just have to watch our chance . When it comes I 'll know what to doI hope I 'll know what to do .
SHIRLEY: I still do n't know what eve made me go steady with a crackpot writer like you .
BOB: All right . Put it on heavy .
SHIRLEY: My old boyfriend Tommy would never have gotten me in a mess like this . At least he 's < /i got brains .
BOB: Him ! I 'll bet he sleeps with all the lights on .
SHIRLEY: Maybe so .
THE MUMMY: I could make her anothe Cleopatra
CRISWELL: Ahh , she will be yours .
BOB: Easy , Shirley . Easy ! The Zombie Dance concludes .

.SISTER ABIGAIL: That 's what really worries you , is n't it ? Something bad happened , the last time you felt this way .
JOHN: Hi there .
ESTHER: Hello . -
JOHN: Are these , paintings all yours ?
ESTH ER: Yes . Do you like them ?
JOHN: Very much . They 're remarkable . -
BSS: h T ank you . My name is Esther . What 's yours ?
JOHN: John . It 's nice to meet you .
ESTHER: My paintings are stories that come from my imagination . -This one'-s about a'sad mother lion who ca n't find her cube .
JOHN: She 's smiling .
ESTHER: She 's dreaming about her babies . It 's the only thing that makes her happy .
JOHN: Well , I hope she finds them .
ESTHER: She will . I , bok .
JOHN: Where did you learn how to do this ?
ESTHER: Y 've just had lots of time to practice , I guess . It 's so boring here .
JOAN: You do n't play outside with the othe girls ? Sounds like they 're having fun .
ESTHER: I like staying inside . That way I do n't get my clothes dirty .
JOHN: - Well , that 's very responsible of you , ut I'll- bet the sisters could find something else for you . to wear .
ESTEER: You.do n't like my dress ? - Do n't you think it 's pretty ? -
JOHN: Your dress is . very pretty . I 'm , just saying . you could -probably go outside if you really wanted to .
ESTHER: Yes , there is . Everybody says there 's not , but it is n't true . I do n't care . If I 'm sad or lonely , I just come in here a nd paint a story with a happy endingg And when people say they like . my paintings , it makes me feel better . I think.peo le should always try to take the bad things that happen to them and turn them into something good . Do n't you ?
JOHN: Hey , I 'd like you to meet someone . - . Esther , this is my wife , Kate .
' RATE: Wow , you 're quite the little-artist .
ESTHE'R: Thank you . You smell nice .
ESTHER: Would you like me to paint you a picture ? You can watch me if-you want . I 'm normally a little shy , but
SISTER ABIGAIL': Esther , I 'm sorry , they do n't have time for you to paint them a picture . They have to come with me now . Yolanda 's going home with them tomorrow . is n't that wonderful ?
ESTHER: Yes . I 'm sure she 'll be very happy .
KATE: It was nice meeting you .
JOHN: You 've got a real talent on your hands here .
SISTER ABIGAIL: Yes , we 're very lucky to have her .
KATE: Thank you so much for all your help .
SISTER ABIGAIL: It 's Russian . It means `` mother . '' INT.JoHN 'S CAR - NIGHT
JOHN: Sorry , I 've got that stuck in my head now .
KATE: She . made quite an impression on.you .
JOHN: I wish you co'uld 've heard the things . she was saying before you c & me in . I Jatow adults who are n't that mature .
BEAT: I wonder ' why they did n't show us he case file .
KATE: She probably was n't there when we were first , looking .
JOHN: It just blows may mind , a kid could go through as much-as she must have and still turn out like that .
KATE: You sound like you 're sorry we 're not adopting her instead of Yolanda .
JOHN: No , of course not . I just hope she . gets the right break . I would n't trade our littl ' e ' girl fo the world . You ) maw that .
HOUSEMOTHER: Where 's Yolanda ?
SISTER JUDITH: Yolanda ? Are you hiding-down here ?
JOHN: .The birth family is claiming her body . They 're planning a private service .
KATE: So that 's it ? She just vanishes from our lives ?
JOHN: We can have our awn-service . I think .it 's important that we -
KATE: I 've been ' in grief counseling fo almost a year-and-a-half.. If you say the word `` closure , . '' I 'm going to-claw your eyes out .
KATE ': It does n't make.anndifference . I ca n't go through this again .
JOHN: so let 's not . Let 's adopt.Bather .
KATE: Her body 's barely cold and you 're already thinking about replacing her ?
JOHN: -Until what ? I do n't want to waste .a nother year of our lives wishing fo something that we.can't-have . . I want us to feel like a family again .
KATE: Let 's see what Sister Abigail thinks .
SISTER ABIGAIL: For the most -part , she 's an'ideal child . She 's originally from Russia , ut her English is flawless , Smart as a.tvhip and very mature °for her age . I do n't think I've-ever had to tell he .anything-twice and I 've never had to clean-up after her.. She 's a bit of a- nQat-freak .
JOHN: I think we can handle that .
SISTER.ABIGAIL: She 's also fiercely independent. , Whatever the other-children want to do , she wants to.dc the opposite .
JOHN: She told me they make fun of her .
SISTER ABIGAIL: I 'm sure they do , but she does n't make- things any easier on herself . She just does n't seem interested in friends.. She does n't even play like a normal child . She just reads and paints . Most of the time she barely-speaks .
KATE: Why do'you think that is ?
SISTER ABIGAIL: I do n't know . There 's nothing in he -history , but that does n't necessarily mean anything . Russian adoption - ecords . are notoriously unreliable .
JOHN: Then what are you basing this on ?
SISTER ABIGAIL: I wish I knew . There 's just something missing with her . A-spark you see in a child 's eyes that is n't there . I 've only seen that-before in cases where the child had been severely traumatized . It might also explain - some of her idiosyncratic behaviors .
JOHN: Like what ?
SISTER ABIGAIL: She refuses to shower or change clothes with the other girls . ' She wo n't even allow the housemother in-the bathroom with her . She . '.s also very concerned with her physical appearance for he age . She 's like a teenager getting eady for a date every morning . She insists on wearing dresses-every day . The ribbons around her wrists and neck stay on day and night . . The only trouble we ever had with her was when we tried to take them off . She kicked two of Sister Francis ' teeth-out .
BEAT: My one reservation is..this . When-an adoption fails , it 's usually because the parents did n't know what to expect . -And'in this case , I ca n't ' tell you what to expect because the plain fact of the- matter is that-I do n't knaw .
KATE: She really did open up with us , did n't she ?
JOHN: She latched . right onto you . We 're probably the best chance she has at a. normal life .
KATE: A normal life.. ' That sounds really good , ' , does n't it ? - She smiles . and takes John- . 's hand .
SISTER ABIGAIL: If you ever need anything , please do n't hesitate to call .
_ESTHER: Come on ! Let's-go ) Kate laughingly lets Esther drag her away .

KATE: Okay , which one do you like ?
ESTHER: These are for a'younger child . Did you pick them out for Yolanda ? Kate is taken aback . She stammers for a beat .
KATE: I 'm sorry . I 'll take them back and pick some just for you .
ESTHER: It 's all right . I rather like this one .
KATE: '1s that a real place ?
ESTHER: No . I just made it up . It 's a haunted castle where a beautiful- princess was locked away . She waited so long and was so sad that she filled the moat with her tears , but then a handsome prince swam , across it and rescued her .
SMILES: I like happy ending 's . Do n't you ?
KATE: These are cute .

ESTHER: Aaaww , -can I pet him ?
KATE: Sure . But you have to promise not to- let him out of his . cage .unless- Hcumey o Daddy is , here to hold him .
ESTEER: Why ? -
KATE: Because he 's very delicate and you could hurt him . Okay ?
DORIS: So what are your plans now ?
KATE: Well , we 'll get Esther settled , then I 'll probably go back , to work .
DORIS: Oh , so you think.they 'll take you back ? Kate 's eyes flicker with irritation .
KATE: I 'm not talking about Yale . I 'm going to teach piano lessons from home .
DORIS: I see . That was such a good position you had at Yale . It 's a. shame .

ESTHER: What other pictures ?
KATE: The ones I saw in . your Bible . Esther gives her a dismayed look .
ESTHER: It 's okay . ' I want you to -see them . She smiles , but it looks forced .
RATE: What 's wrong ? .
ESTHER: I hid these because Idid n't want you to know how much I miss ' them , I was afraid you 'd think I did n't love you .
KATE: It 's okay , sweetie I understand . You know , I lost someone who was very .special to me once , too .
ESTHER: Really ?

JOHN: We 'll talk to her about it tonight .
KATE: You think that 's enough ?
JOHN': What do you suggest ?
KATE ': I could take her to Doctor Browning .
JOHN: It was one dirty word . I do n't think we need to call in the shrink just-yet .
KATE: Maybe . It just reminded The of what Sister Abigail said.. We really do n't know that much about her . '- The last 'family she-was with could have been - like , `` Pass the fucking potatoes '' at the dinner table for all we know . '
JOHN: Iget it , I just- don `` t want to make a igger deal out of it than it is .
KATE: If she 's saying `` fuck '' to my face , what 's she doing when we 're not around ? We have to be thinking about what kind of influence she 's having-on Daniel and Max . Particularly Max .

KATE: Esther , come on .

HYGIENIST: She has n't had a check-up in about two years , so she 's a little nervous .
DENTIST: That a girl Little wider She opens more . He leans in to take a look
KATE: He 's been our dentist for ten years . Why would he lie to us ?
JQAN: I did n't say he 's lying . I just think Ws-blowing it out of proportion ,
KATE: I saw the bite marks . We 're lucky he 's not suing us .
JOHN: Fine , but I do n't believe for a '' second that she just did it for no reason .
RATE: That 's because she 's always on her best ehavior with you .
JOHN': That 's . not true . I 've had to deal with her at her worst..
JOHN: So you 've seen her haul off'and bite someone like an animal ?
KATE: No , but she threw that fit at school
JOEN: Yeah , because the other kids were harassing her . It 's the same thing here . She 's from a completely different culture Kate . She has to be taught that this . behavior is n't appropriate ut there 's nothing malicious about it . If'she says she bit him because she was scared and he was hurting her , I do n't see any reason not to believe her .
KATE: So should .1 believe her when she says you 've been hitting on Joyce Patterson ?
JOHN': Did she say that ? t .
]CATS: Is it true ?
JOHN: of course not !
KATE: Did-she invite You over ? '
JOHN: She wanted me to help her move a chair .
KATE: Oh , - come on .
ON: All right , she was obviously coming to me . But I shut her down .
KATE: Then why did n't you tell me ?
JOHN: Because I knew how you 'd reactl
KATE: Really ? You sure it was n't because you were coming-on to her so obviously that an eight-year-old picked upon it ? A long-beat . John sighs , resigned.-
JOHN: How-long are you going to keep this hanging over me ? It was ten years ago .
KATE: You keep-saying that . But it 's only een about two years since you told me . Having another child was -supposed to ing us together .
JOHN: I 'm sorry I did n't tell you-about it- x just feel like I 've earned a little trust here .
KATE: I was sick ! You were just an asshole who wanted to fuck somebody else !
JOHN: You were a danger to our children . If I did n't want to . make this work , I could have left months ago and nobody would have blamed me .
KATE: Nice . Is that-what-your mother told you ?
ESTHER: THE MAN LADY YS Comm TOMORROW .
ESTHER ': Look for the key to the treehouse . '
ESTHER: Do you -want to_ play ? -
BEAT: Not yet . -
SISTER ABIGAIL: When you first asked about adopting Esther , I expressed some misgivings . But I was n't completely straightforward with you . You see , I love children . I 've worked with them my entire life . And the thing about love is that it sometimes clouds your judgement .
BEAT: But the truth is that I knew there was something wrong with Esther from the moment I laid eyes on her . Kate sits up , concerned . John bristles .
SISTER ABIGAIL: Yes , but there was something else . It was hard to say chat it was at first . Just-a feeling that she was a profoundly damaged little girl .
JOAN: But none of these things were he fault .
SISTER ABIGAIL: That 's ; g I was reluc ! tant to t anything bef ore. Now ' I think th at may a have been a mistake . Children like Esther , who 've spent their entire lives-in institutions , have never had ' a chance to 'form normal , lasting bonds.. The longterm effects of 'this- can be devastating . In the very worst cases , children who fail to form early attachments are unable to learn the difference between'right and wrong . They can lie , cheat , steal - .or worse -and and have no remorse whatsoever for their actions . ' They view other human beings as objects , pawns for their amusement . And they can-be potentially very dangerous .
SISTER ABIGAIL: A severely character-disturbed child can appear to be -completely normal , -even exceptional . It 's like they have two faces one-they show the outside world in order'to get what they want , and the other , their true face , lying just beneath the surface .
KATE: What about the orphanage in Russia where she was raised ? Would n't they have been able to tell ?
SISTER ABIGAIL: That 's true , -I do n't . But I believe the circumstantial evidence is enough to warrant taking the next step .
RATE: Which is what ? -
JOHN: You want to disrupt the adoption ove this ? !
JOHN: She 's just a kids -
SISTER ABIGAIL: She 's also the sole-survivor of a house fire that killed her last family . It was arson . I did some checking . Someone deliberately set that fire . They-never caught who did it .
JOHN: Wait a minute , you 're not suggesting
SISTER ABIGAIL: Pyromania is one of the warning signs of a characterdisturbed child . Rate blanches , realizing
KATE: Do you think she had something to do with'what happened to Yolanda ?
JOHN: We can take her to Doctor -Browning . - Kate suggested doing that weeks ago . But I do n't want to send her away . Not without at least some kind of proof .
KATE: But what if 'the doctor says she 's dangerous ?
JOH1: Then I guess we.won't.bave any choice .
ESTHER: Here she . comes . Wait until she gets close .
SISTER ABIGAIL: Dear Lord ! Are you okay , honey ?
ESTHER: Help me get her off the road .
ESTHER: If you tell on me , you 'll get in trouble , too .
ESTHER: She wanted to take me away from you .
BEAT: Now we eau be together forever .
RATE: She 's canceling some appointments-so we - can get her in-tomorrow .
JOHN: Esther and Max ? You saw them ?
DANIEL: Oh-huh .
JOHN: The treehouse is still locked .
DANIEL: Esther had the-keys .
JOHN: You mean these keys here ?
DANIEL: No , I swear !
JOHN: I do n't know what 's got into you lately . Just go to your room . Daniel leaves , dejected
ESTHER: ssshhh .

ESTHER: You pissed yourself .
ESTBER: It was nice talking to you , Alice . I I hope we can be friends .
DR. BROWNING: I 'd like that . You can come on in-
KATE: She 's not dangerous ?
DR. BROWNING: No , of course not .
JOHN: Thank God .
DR. BROWNING: It 's . not all good news . You do have a serious problem in . your home..
BEAT: But the real issue is with you , Rate Kate reacts , stunned .
ESTRER: May I go to the restroom ?
DR. BROWNING: I was able to coax her into admitting that there 's been some tension between the two of-you . She 's really tr ! ing very hard to please you . The problem is that you 're blocking her attempts-to attach-with you . That 's why wheneve something bad happens , you blame her , whether it 's really her fault or not .
KATE: But that 's not what's.been happening .
DR. BROWNING: I doubt you 're even aware that you 're doing it . But subconsciously you t aunt her to be bad because ' demonizing her is your way of covering your own feelings _ of inadequacy as a mother .
KATE: I do n't feel inadequate .
DR. BROWNING: But you do have doubts . You worry that ' you Could relapse .
KATE: What does that have to do with'Esther ?
DR. BROWNING: Frankly , everything . Your guilt ove what happened with Max is preventing- you from bonding with Esther .
ESTEER: She did n't see . She does n't know . She does n't knout Ahitl
DR. BROWNING: She 's an extremely bright , thoughtful , sensitive little girl going through a very challenging time .
ESTHER: Goddamn , coaksucking bitch ! ! Thinks she knows well Does n't know shit ! !
DR. BROWNING: You just have to learn to be more patient . .You 're really very lucky to have her .
KATE: Thanks for the support back there .
JOHN: Hey , I 'm not a psychiatrist . And a lot of what she 's saying makes sense .
KATE: Yes . Who 's calling ?
JOHN: We 'll help in any way we can . We at least owe her that much .
KATE: Do you have any idea who could have done this ? '
DETECTIVE ': We have .a suspect in custody based on an anonymous -tip . We 're just trying . to - place ham at the time we think the - murder took place . -
JOHN: Who is it ?
DETECTIVE: I ca n't tell you that right now . But he was found with the murder weapon , along with some cash and credit cards .
JOHN: Jesus.. at kind of sick ' monste carjacks a nun ?

KATE: - I 'm not 'seeing her anymore..
JOHN: You 're not going to therapy ? When did you decide that ?
SATE: When do you think ? John sighs . A tense-beat .
JOHN: I know you were . upset . But we have to at least consider the possibility that she 's right about this .
KATE: No , we do n't . Why does everybody around here get the.benefit of the doubt fro m you except me ?
JOHN: That 's not true . I 'm just..worried about you , that 's all . We can hire someone to help you with the kids if it 's getting to be too much .
KATE: I do n't need help . All I want is for a doctor who knows what they 're doing to give us a second opinion .
JOHN: We're-not going to.keep taking her to doctors until you hear what you want to hear .
RATS: She did n't want to believe it . But she was worried enough-to think we should put her in foster care until we found out for sure .
JOHN: For all , her good intentions , siste Abigail was not a trained psychologist . She'had certain suspicions about Esthe and they turned out to be wrong . Why is ca n't you accept that ?
KATE: ts ) What if somebody else thought there was something wrong with her ? Like the director of the orphanage in Russia ?
JOHN: All right.- See what you can find out .
EST=: I .do n't mind .
KATE: Sister Judith ? Hi , this is Kate .Coleman . I teas.wondering if you 'd heard from anyone at the Sludianka Orphan 's Shelter in Russia . siste Abigail said that- Oh , you did ? _ What do you mean ? Well , I do n't understand . How could they not have any record of her being there ?
LISTENS: .Yes , please . Call me the moment you hear anything . Thank you . She hangs up , disturbed .
JOHN: What 's the matter ?
ESTHER: I do n't want to go to school .
JOHN: Why not ?
ESTHER: I hate it . Nobody likes me there . Nobody ever likes me .
JOHN: You want-to play hooky ? I can call in- sick and we 'll go to -the zoo . What do you think ? Esther smiles through her tears .

ESTHER: I do n't think ! 'Tommy likes me very much .
JOHN: That 's not true..- Mc=my loves 'you .
ESTHER: It 's all right . I understand if she does n't . It must be difficult to love an adopted child as much as- your own..
JOHN: Sweetheart , .you are just as much a part of this family- as Danny . and Max are . Mommy does n't love'you any less because you 're adopted . Do you understand ?
EST LER: That 's a wonderful idea . I think I know just what I'm.going to do , too .
ESTHER: I have a special surprise for you , Mommy . Kate eyes her warily . No idea what to expect .
KATE: You do ?
JOHN: What the hell did you do to her ?
KATE: I just grabbed her arm !
JOHN: It was n't even her idea . I 'm the one who told her she should try to do something nice for you . He leaves .
ESTHER: Daddy ! Daddy !
JOHN: what in it , sweetheart ?
ESTHER: My arm huits . '
ER DOCTOR: It 's a hairline fracture in her radius .
KATE: I swear , I barely touched her .
SKEPTICAL: You 'll need to talk to the social - worker about that . She 's going to come in here- and ask you some questions .
JOHN: But.it was just an.accident .
ER DOCTOR: It 's routine . We 're required by law to file . a report . Child Protective Services will be in touch to schedule a follow-up visit at your home .
KATE: You know I would never hurt any of the- . kids on purpose .
JOHN: I know . It 's not what you do on purpose that scares me .
KATE: We 're having guests over for dinner .
ESTHER: I ca n't wait for show-and-tell . I hope Mrs. Grosse . likes my paintings . I did one especially for her..
KATE: You dropped them on purpose .

DR. BROWNING: It also-would n't be the first time that you 've tried to blame Esther for . something that was really your fault .
XATE: This . isn-'t all in my head . Siste Abigail was right . There is something wrong with Esther . And I do n't care anymore if I ca n't prove it . I'want her out of this house . John and Dr. Browning exchange a dark look .
KATE: I 'll do whatever I have to , do to protect my children .

JOHN: Kate , do n't .
KATE: The girls ? '' You mean Esther found it .
JOHN: Yes , Esther found it . Does that make a difference ? Is she lying ? A beat . Kate 's silence-is answer enough .
KATE: I did n't I bought two bottles . I poured the other one down-the sink .
JOHN: But not this onie .
KATE: I 'm not going to rehab .
JQHN: I 'm not going to leave you-alone with the kids again until you do . - .
KATE: I have n't had a drink in almost a year .
DR. DROWNING: Relapse is very common in early sobriety . We can help you . But not until you drop the charade . -
KATE: It 's not a charade . I wanted to- drink i t. You have no fucking idea how.badly I wanted to drink it . But I did n't . I know 1 should have told you.. I was just afraid of what you 'd do .
JOHN: I wanted you to come to me . That 's why , I did n't confront you with it last night . If Max had gotten hurt this morning , it . would 've been because I trusted you tell me if there was a problem .
RATE: What happened this morning had nothing to do with this !
JOHN: l f ow do you expect me to believe that ?
KATE: Max and Daniel are the only reason I 'm still sober . I would never do anything that would hurt them .
DR. BROWNING: You do n't think this behavior effects them ?
KATE: You know damn.well what I 'm talking about .
JOHN: Then why-not throw both bottles away ?
KATE: I 'm not the one you need to be worried aboutt Seven people close to Esthe have died in the past year . Max was almost the eighth . now many more coincidences are you willing to ignore ?
JOHN: Kate , stop it . You 're talking about an eight-year-old girl . And right now she 's making a lot more sense than you are .
KATE: I know I have n't given you any reason to believe me . But you have to . I 'm egging you .
JOHN: I 'm sorry . Maybe if you 'd been honest with me from the start . But not now .

DANIEL: r She 's coming .
ESTHER: She 's fine . Lot 's not wake her .
KATE: What are you doing in here ?
ESTHER: 1-could n't sleep . I was-afraid you might try to take Daniel and Max away . Kate stands frozen , frustrated and'angry .

SIR THOMAS: I received a formal request for marriage today for Anne . From the Carey family . SIR THOMAS indicates to ANNE ; the eldest . Dark-haired .
LADY ELIZABETH: But that 's wonderful .
SIR THOMAS: I turned it down . LADY ELIZABETH turns ` What ? '
LADY ELIZABETH: You underestimate Mary .
SIR THOMAS: Not true . I think she's..the kinder of the two . Quite possibly the fairer .
ANNE: May we come in.. ?
MARY: Hardly .
GEORGE: No , is this it ? This is the end of the unholy trinity ?
MARY: No , George . Never . I 'll be married , that 's all.. Apart from that - it wo n't change a thing . The three of them hug together , tightly..
PRIEST: Confirma hoc , Deus , quod operatus es in nobis..
WILLIAM: Are you happy ?
MARY: Very .
WILLIAM: You do n't secretly wish you 'd married someone grander ? With a title ?
MARY: No . I want a husband who loves me . And who thinks it first thing every morning . And last thing at night .
WILLIAM: Then you 've found the right man .
ANNE: Who is that ? He was staring at me in church ?
GEORGE: That 's Henry Percy . Heir to the Duke of Northumberland . Richest landowner in England . ANNE 's eyes widen in interest , `` Really ? ''
GEORGE: But do n't get your hopes up . He is already betrothed .
ANNE: Betrothed is not married , brothe George . A lot can happen before you each the altar .
SIR THOMAS: Thomas..
NORFOLK: I think I have managed to persuade the King to come and stay with you on progress . A week-end 's hunting in late summer .
SIR THOMAS: But that 's wonderful ! Thank you , thank you so much.. Did you hear that , Elizabeth ?
LADY ELIZABETH: Yes .
SIR THOMAS: Finally we can present George , and with luck , get him a position at court . LADY ELIZABETH excuses herself , and leaves..
NORFOLK: These are difficult times . I have it on good authority that the Queen no longe leeds - yet the matter of a male hei is still not resolved . a beat ) It can not be long before the King is forced to look outside the marriage .
SIR THOMAS: What ? And make a bastard King of England ?
NORFOLK: A legitimized bastard . What choice does he have ? Obviously , I 've given it thought , and wondered which Howard girl I could put under his nose . Imagine the influence that would give us . To be blood family of the next King of England . Equally , imagine if another family were to achieve the same ?
SIR THOMAS: What about Anne ?
NORFOLK: But she 's your eldest , Thomas . You first born . And your favourite . Would n't you prefer her to have a nice , uncomplicated , respectable marriage ? Like Mary ?
SIR THOMAS: If Anne were an uncomplicated , espectable girl like Mary , then I 'd say ` yes ' . But she 's not . SIR THOMAS looks out at ANNE..
ADY ELIZABETH: do n't like it . It would cost a fortune to make our house fit for a royal visit . Money we do n't have .
SIR THOMAS: And what if you were to look on the ight side ? Just once ? An ominous clap of thunder outside..
LADY ELIZABETH: hen was it that people stopped thinking of ambition as a sin , and started thinking of it as a virtue ?
SIR THOMAS: Easy for you to say . You 've had powe and wealth all your life .
LADY ELIZABETH: Until I married you , Thomas . And I was happy to give it up . LADY ELIZABETH turns , and walks back inside .
ANNE: You asked to see me father ?
SIR THOMAS: Yes . Come in . SIR THOMAS closes the door .
MARY: o - the King himself is coming to Hever . I 'm so happy for George .
ANNE: Yes . But Father took me aside . It seems he has ambitions for me , too .
MARY: What ? What are you saying.. ?
ANNE: It 's known the King has a wandering eye . Imagineif he were to like me ?
MARY: Butyou could never be more than his mistress . And that 's no substitute for a husband .
ANNE: But as the King 's mistress the least I 'd get after he finished with me would be an Earl . And if I fell pregnant ? And gave him what his wife has failed to ? a beat ) Quite apart from the money , it 'd be a Duke at least .
MARY: But what about your happiness ? You future ? ANNE shrugs , smiles..
ANNE: I could be a happy Duchess .
MARY: A little .
ANNE: You 'll tell me everything in the morning ?
MARY: I promise .
ANNE: No details spared ?
MARY: Hold me a moment ? WILLIAM CAREY envelops MARY with his arms.. MARY I 'm so lucky to have a man who is content with what he has . MARY looks at him.. MARY You are , are n't you ?

SIR THOMAS: And our daughter , Anne . ENRY turns to see ANNE .
ENRY: No one said anything of a daughter . ANNE curtseys deeply
HENRY: Had we known , we might have come sooner .
ANNE: Your Majesty..
SIR THOMAS: Perhaps you 'll allow Anne to show you around our modest house ?
HENRY: A pleasure .
ANNE: Here is the library .
HENRY: Charming .
ANNE: And through here , the observatory..
HENRY: Lovely..
HENRY: What 's that ? HENRY points at an emblem above a doorway..
ANNE: falcon , your Grace .
HENRY: I can see that . But what 's it doing there ? More to the point.. ..not just there , but in every corner in the house ?
ANNE: I have no idea . Ask my father . a beat ) Perhaps because falcons are vaguely associative with field sports - field sports with aristocracy - and in the absence of a genuine coat of arms.. a man with ambition will do the strangest things . HENRY is delighted by ANNE 's candour..
ENRY: That 's a sharp tongue you have . a beat ) I wonder what it might say about me ehind my back ?
ANNE: Oh , his Majesty has nothing to fear from me . Unless he fears an excess of compliments . HENRY smiles , visibly charmed..
HENRY: Really ? And what would they be.. ?
SIR THOMAS: Bravo , Anne ! The King was quite smitten ! Told me so himself . And has requested you sit beside him at dinner . SIR THOMAS adjusts her hair..
HENRY: Well played ! And , may I say.. ..an excellent choice of music too !
HENRY: ..I had it from the lips of the Spanish ambassador himself . That our musicians are the envy of all Europe .
BRANDON: ..then he was flattering you , you Grace .
HENRY: Our Universities and philosophers , too .
BRANDON: another lie . That honour would have to go to the Germans .
HENRY: What of our painters , then ?
RANDON: Years behind their Italian counterparts . The truth is far from leading the world , we 're a provincial outpost , lagging fa ehind .
HENRY: What ? Is no one proud to be English ? Anne ? What say you ?
ANNE: Me , my Lord ? clears throat ) I know little of such matters , but I 've not heard mention of our armies . Undefeated , I believe , in a generation .
ENRY: Well said .
ANNE: Or our navy ? The finest in the world .
HENRY: It 's true .
ANNE: The universities in Spain and the philosophers in Germany may be strong , ut are they really the equal of Oxford and Thomas More ?
HENRY: Never !
ANNE: I doubt there is a country that is fairer in Government , or bette protected by nature from her enemies , whose people are happier or more prosperous..
HENRY: She 's right , by God ! She 's right !
SIR THOMAS: You did well tonight . Very well . Quite enough to be invited to court , I am sure of it . SIR THOMAS kisses ANNE 's forehead..
HENRY: Good morning , Anne . ANNE curtseys deeply..
ANNE: Good morning , your Grace .
HENRY: ho will you be riding with ?
ANNE: On my own your Grace .
HENRY: Your own.. ? A STABLE-BOY leads out her horse .
ANNE: They have invented a new saddle which allows ladies to ride on their own .
HENRY: ut with no man to hold onto ? How will you stay on the horse ?
ANNE: Why ? The same way you hold onto yours , your Grace .
HENRY: We 'll see . ENRY yanks the reins on his horse..
HENRY: Hah.. !

ENRY: he King of England defeated by a humble fawn .

PHYSICIAN: It 's a miracle , Majesty , you have no oken bones.. HENRY flinches in agony , tries to move..
SIR THOMAS: My daughter Anne is here . Would like to apologise .

MARY: Next to Anne , it 's easy to do .
HENRY: Nonsense .
MARY: Yes , your Grace . To William Carey .
ENRY: From Wolsey 's office ?
MARY: Yes , your Grace .
HENRY: Then why have n't I seen you at court ?
MARY: Because I have persuaded him to spend a year or two here first . We have a small manor and some land . Nothing much . But enough to start a family .
HENRY: A charmed life in the country ? Away from it all ?
MARY: Yes .
HENRY: Everything I would have wished fo myself . But then my brother died . a beat ) And duty called . HENRY looks at MARY , then..
MARY: He says not , your Majesty . MARY lowers her eyes..
HENRY: Well said .
SIR THOMAS: Consider it done , your Majesty .
STAFFORD: Your Father wishes to see you .
NORFOLK: Mary , I do n't know what you said or did - ut you obviously made a deep impression on the King . exchanges a look with SIR
THOMAS: And he has requested you come to court with immediate effect . MARY 's eyes widen in disbelief..'What ? '

SIR THOMAS: ell her .

SIR THOMAS: Y'hear that ? Gentleman of the Privy Council ! Attending to the private and personal needs of his Majesty himself ! That 's the inner sanctum ! MARY 's shell-shocked , lost for words..
MARY: But what about our future ? Here in the country ?
NORFOLK: Put it out of your mind . From now on your home is at court .
MARY: William , please ! Do n't you understand what this means ? MARY stares imploringly..
NORFOLK: Happily your husband understands the value of such an opportunity . For us all .
MARY: What about Anne ? Could n't she go instead ?
SIR THOMAS: The way that girl behaved this week-end , she can count herself lucky she still has a home .
MARY: How could he DO this to me ? My own father . a beat ) What if we just refused ?
WILLIAM: We would be cut off . He made that clear .
MARY: But would that be so bad ? MARY stares at him..
WILLIAM: You say that now - but when you 're older ? And our children are grown up ? This wo n't last long . A year . Maybe two . And at the end of that - we 'll we have everything we want . It 's for our FUTURE .
MARY: ut ca n't you see ? Do this , and we might not HAVE a future .

MARY: I ca n't imagine . Should I mention you to him ?
JANE: Would you ?
MARY: Of course . Happily .
GEORGE: Not noticed her ? Jane Parker ? Of course I have . How could I not ? She looks like a goat .
MARY: Well , she likes you , and asked me to give you this..to remember her by . MARY hands over a handkerchief..
GEORGE: Ugh . Well say you have n't seen me . O that you forgot . GEORGE hastily gives it back.. GEORGE There is something about that woman that makes me feel
MARY: And our sister ? Any word ?
GEORGE: ANNE ? You know she took being upstaged y you very badly .
MARY: Yes , I know .
GEORGE: And no amount of interventions on my ehalf would make her believe you had n't done it intentionally .
MARY: But you KNOW I would never do anything like that .
GEORGE: I know . GEORGE finds his helmet , puts it on.. GEORGE Just give her time . She 'll come round .
ENRY: I wanted to find somewhere we could be alone so I might say a few words to you in person . ENRY turns , looks around the room..
HENRY: I hope your accommodation is comfortable . I realise it 's no substitute for the life you had in mind in the country.. But please , give me the opportunity to try to make you happy here..
HE: The moment I met you , I realised I..
HENRY: What are you.. ?
NORFOLK: What ? If all the King wanted was coition , he could fetch in a woman from the bath house . a beat ) What he wants is YOU . a beat ) To woo you . And be wooed in return . And could'nt you look just a little happier ? There is n't a girl in the Kingdom that would n't wish to be in you shoes .
MARY: Your opinion , Uncle . MARY speaks quietly . Lowers her head..
ORFOLK: What ?
MARY: Asking a whore to have feelings , too .
PRIEST: Are you there ?
ANNE: No .
PRIEST: You brought the money .
RIEST: Good . Then let us begin .
MARY: George ? It 's the middle of the night .
GEORGE: t 's Anne .
MARY: hat ?
GEORGE: he 's married Henry Percy !
MARY: What ?
GEORGE: In secret . Without telling anyone ! MARY 's face falls..
MARY: Oh , no !
GEORGE: tailing off ) You do n't look pleased .
MARY: Why would I be pleased ?
GEORGE: It would make her the future Duchess of Northumberland . Our sister !
MARY: But they 'll never allow it , do n't you see ? He 's already precontracted to Mary Talbot , and if word of the consummation gets out her reputation will be ruined.. MARY pulls back her sheets..
GEORGE: What ? GEORGE watches MARY go to the door..
SIR THOMAS: What were you thinking ? The marriage of a senior noble is a matter of state . Something only the King can decide..
NORFOLK: Who knows about this ?
ANNE: No one .
NORFOLK: Then that is how it shall remain . Forever .
ANNE: But you can not undo what has been done efore God . And consummated too .
NORFOLK: WHAT ?
SIR THOMAS: There have been improper intimacies , too ?
ANNE: I have lain with my husband . There is nothing improper about it..
NORFOLK: SILENCE ! My God , if you were my daughte I 'd thrash you within an inch of you life.. ANNE recoils , terrified..
SIR THOMAS: The boy will return to Northumberland - where he will marry the Talbot girl . As arranged .
ORFOLK: As for you . You will go to France and stay there until you have learned you lesson .
MARY: What ?
ORFOLK: How could you do this to your sister ? You know full well her friendship with the King is at an extremely delicate stage . Any scandal or black mark against Mary 's name now could be fatal . SIR THOMAS dismisses her..
NORFOLK: You will join the court of the French Queen . And stay there until your fathe has forgiven you . ANNE goes . GEORGE follows..
ANNE: ou told them , did n't you ? a beat ) How COULD you ?
MARY: Because you would never have got away with it . And it would have ruined you prospects forever . Believe me . I did it for your good .
ANNE: Really ? For MY good ? I 'll try to remind myself of that . While I 'm in exile . And you 're here , in the King 's bed , and unchallenged for our father 's affection . a beat ) That it was for MY good . Not yours .
MARY: ANNE , wait.. !
MASKED MAN: Why look so glum , Mary ? MARY turns to see a MASKED MAN behind her .
MARY: What reason have I to be happy ?
MASKED MAN: ou have two men , the King of England and I , both fighting for your love .
MARY: Do I know you ?
MASKED MAN: You know me , Mary - but not half as well as I know you . I know you better than anyone here . And love you better than anyone here , too . And if God had made ME your husband instead of William Carey , one thing I know.. I would never have let you go . MARY 's smile fades..
MARY: Wait ! Who ARE you ?
MARY: What is it you desire ?
MARY: Your Majesty.. !
HENRY: he faints ! Quick ! Take her to my rooms ! Call my physicians.. !
ENRY: Go ! Leave us ! Go !
MARY: Thank you , your Grace .
HENRY: ` Henry ' , please . The first rule of this oom , is to leave ` Your Grace 's ' and ` Your Majesty 's ' outside . ENRY looks up..
MARY: No .
HENRY: Nothing to increase your comfort or well- eing ?
MARY: You might ask your servants to bring me some water . HENRY goes to get water himself..
HENRY: There . There ARE no servants .
MARY: So , this is it ? This is where the King of England sleeps ?
HENRY: And reads . And writes . And finds a few moments each day for himself . HENRY smiles at MARY.. HENRY You look surprised ?
MARY: I am . I suppose it 's more..
ENRY: There 's no need for show . I am only eve here alone .
MARY: And yet you invite me here ?
HENRY: Because I trust you .
MARY: You hardly know me .
HENRY: A man in my position develops an instinct . a beat ) You would never lie , could never lie to me . MARY smiles , admitting he 's right .
MARY: No .
HENRY: I also sensethat you might relish an opportunity to be yourself , too .
MARY: Yes .
HENRY: Well , here you only say what you like , do what you like .
MARY: I 'd like an apple , please.. ..Henry .
HENRY: What ?
MARY: To say something , or do something you could n't outside .
HENRY: There are many things I can not admit to in public . Sadness , for example . And loneliness .
MARY: But when you are loved as much as you are ? How can you be lonely ?
HENRY: Do you not know what it is to be lonely in a marriage ?
MARY: Yes . I do now .
ENRY: married my brother 's widow because my father ordered it . As a duty . To keep the alliance with Spain . And she is a emarkable woman . And wife . HENRY looks at MARY..
HENRY: But I never looked at her or longed fo her the way I do you . HENRY reaches out . Their hands meet..
TAFFORD: Good morning .
STAFFORD: I have orders to bring you to you father .
MARY: My father.. ? a beat ) Well , we 'd better not keep him waiting . STAFFORD turns , leads the way . MARY follows .
NORFOLK: Well.. ? MARY stares at her husband..
MARY: Yes .
NORFOLK: More than once ? MARY stares daggers..
MARY: Yes . More than once . WILLIAM CAREY 's face a flicker of pain..
NORFOLK: So he was satisfied ?
MARY: I believe so , Uncle .
NORFOLK: ood . This is where our work begins . It 's one thing to catch the king . Quite another to keep him .
HENRY: The biggest warship in the fleet . Thirty- two guns and two hundred feet long , and with your permission Thomas.. ..I 'd like to name her after you daughter . The `` Mary Boleyn '' . SIR THOMAS looks up in disbelief..
SIR THOMAS: Majesty ! I'mI 'm speechless..
HENRY: onsense . She 's an angel . It 's the least she deserves . And if there 's anything else I can do for YOU , my friend..as an expression of my gratitude..let me know . SIR THOMAS 's tails off . Thinking..
HENRY: Name it .
SIR THOMAS: ur son , George . He 's of an age now..
HENRY: You want me to make him a match ? SIR THOMAS bows . Deadly serious..
SIR THOMAS: Yes , your Majesty .
HENRY: Do you have anyone in mind ?
SIR THOMAS: There is one lady , Sir..
HENRY: Go on..
SIR THOMAS: Who I fear is too high-born for us . And following the unfortunate matter between Anne and Henry Percy , I did n't want my children to overreach themselves again..
HENRY: verreach themselves ? HENRY ca n't help smiling..
EORGE: I beg you , Father . No .
SIR THOMAS: She 's well connected , her father is cousin to the King . And there 's money , too .
GEORGE: But must I actuallymarry her ? SIR THOMAS 's expression changes..
SIR THOMAS: thought you had ambitions for this family . G
EORGE: I do .
SIR THOMAS: And that you wish to make a contribution yourself . Not just stand back and watch your sisters . EORGE nods..
GEORGE: Yes , Sir .
SIR THOMAS: For God 's sake , it 's the wedding of ou youngest child attended by the King of England and the greatest Lords in the Land . Would a smile be too much to ask ?
LADY ELIZABETH: What 's to smile about ? I 'm a mother with one child on his wedding day looking like he 's been condemned to death .
SIR THOMAS: For the moment she 's happy .
LADY ELIZABETH: But will she be happy when he leaves her ? Because you know that 's how it will end .
SIR THOMAS: Only God knows how anything will end .
LADY ELIZABETH: God.. ? He turned his back on all this a long time ago .
WILLIAM: You 're in love with him , are n't you ?
MARY: illiam , you 're drunk .
WILLIAM: How is it ? With him ? MARY stares - suddenly hard - punishing him .
MARY: He pleases me . Is that what you want to hear ?
WILLIAM: What does he do to you ? Tell me . I want to know..
MARY: Say ` no ' , husband . That was all you had to do .
SIR THOMAS: Are you certain ?
MARY: Yes . SIR THOMAS looks at the PHYSICIAN , who nods..
SIR THOMAS: n that caseI supposesomeone should tell the King .
SIR THOMAS: Now open !
ELIZABETH: So our debts are paid off . But LADY ELIZABETH remains granite-faced..
LADY ELIZABETH: Just be aware . These ` gifts ' , this ` favour ' can go as swiftly as it comes . These rooms belonged to the Duke of Buckingham . Once the King 's closest friend . Now his head rots on a spike..
SIR THOMAS: Because he committed treason .
ADY ELIZABETH: But what is ` treason ' ? It 's anything the King or his lawyers decide it to be . Anything that offends him , or causes him displeasure . a beat ) And can you assure me we 'll never do that ?
SIR THOMAS: Pay her no heed..
PHYSICIAN: Happily , the baby lives . She 's not miscarried .
PHYSICIAN: But the placenta is weak . For the sake of the child..
MARY: What ? MARY looks up . Her heart sinks .
HENRY: ou poor girl . All alone in here . But the time will fly by .
MARY: Will it ? It 's six months ?
HENRY: I know . But the most important thing is a healthy child . ENRY takes MARY 's hand.. HENRY I 'll come and see you as often as I can . I promise .
NORFOLK: For the moment he 's still visiting Mary . But for how long ? The Queen will soon have his head spinning with pretty little Spanish things . Not to mention the Seymours with that girl of theirs . NORFOLK looks up
SIR THOMAS: It 's justI was going to suggest Anne .
NORFOLK: You could n't control that girl last time . What makes you think it would be any different now ?
SIR THOMAS: I 've had favourable reports from the Dowager Queen in France . It seems she is quite changed .
MARY: Why ?
GEORGE: I suppose they felt three years of exile was punishment enough .
MARY: But the King visits me every day . There 's no need for her . Or anyone else .
GEORGE: They just want to protect you . Leave nothing to chance .
MARY: But in who 's interests do they imagine Anne will act ? Certainly not mine . GEORGE turns , looks all around him.. GEORGE Why DO they make this room such a dungeon ? Does it really need to be this dark ? GEORGE notices MARY 's vexed expression..
GEORGE: Do n't worry . She 's had three years to forgive you . And she 's not going to risk eing sent away again . She 'll do as she 's told , I 'm sure . Besides , the most important thing is..
HENRY: What 's the noise ? I can hardly hea myself think !
BRANDON: It 's Mistress Boleyn , your Majesty . He stories about life at the French court . They are particularly amusing .
HENRY: I 'm only aware of one Boleyn girl and she is lying-in with a certain child in her belly !
SIR THOMAS: It 's my elder daughter , Anne , you Majesty . She has returned to court .
HENRY: What ? That awful girl , Thomas ? The one that almost killed me ? You allowed her back ?
SIR THOMAS: The time abroad has done her good , you Majesty . I 'm certain you 'd find her much improved .
HENRY: Really.. ? HENRY looks down the table..
ANNE: I was just giving my thoughts on the new French King .
HENRY: Which are.. ?
ANNE: That for someone with such great wealth , and power..he has surprisingly little authority as a man .
HENRY: Hah !
ANNE: And is SO consumed by one particula ivalry he can barely think .
HENRY: eally ? And who is this rival ?
ANNE: A neighbouring King , who 's name one is forbidden to mention at court . Whose eputation haunts him in his thoughts and dreams . ipples of laughter , as people guess..
HENRY: What ?
ANNE: That in this department too , the King has his shortcomings .
SIR THOMAS: You should have seen the Seymours ! Thei faces !
MARY: Or HER , you mean .
SIR THOMAS: What ?
MARY: 'm wary of any suggestion that Anne would serve anyone but herself . France ca n't have changed her THAT much .
SIR THOMAS: n this occasion I am quite satisfied she was being loyal to you .
MARY: Really ? MARY stares hollow-eyed.. MARY Then ask yourself this . If she is really so concerned for my well-being
HENRY: You 're a fortunate man , George . To be lessed with G two such sisters .
EORGE: Yes , my Lord .
ENRY: Tell me . Are they as different in tempe as they are in looks ?
GEORGE: Oh , yes . Each has her own , quite distinct virtues . Mary for example..
HENRY: I 'm familiar with Mary 's . Tell me about Anne 's .
GEORGE: Anne ? Well , she 's strong . Some might say ` difficult ' .
ENRY: Headstrong . With a fiery temper .
GEORGE: But with it comes great passion , too . It 's both the best and the worst thing about her . a beat ) There are no half measures with Anne .
HENRY: Careful , you 'll make me think I chose the wrong Boleyn girl .
GEORGE: Oh , no . I 'm certain Mary is the right choice . You will have a serene , happy , life with her . The risk is with Anne , it might be like being caught in a wild summer storm .
HENRY: Is that so.. ?
ERVANT: From the King , madam .
ANNE: Open it . A SERVANT stares..
HENRY: She did what ?
SERVANT: Sent it back , your Grace . HENRY 's face . Confounded..
HENRY: Sent it back ?
LADY ELIZABETH: Your Majesty .
HENRY: Your daughter . Where is she ?
LADY ELIZABETH: Mary.. ?
HENRY: Anne !
ANNE: Your Grace ? They speak through the door..
HENRY: You received my gifts ?
ANNE: Yes .
HENRY: And ? They did not please you ?
ANNE: On the contrary , my Lord . They pleased me greatly .
HENRY: Then why did you return them ?
ANNE: ecause my sister lies in bed with you child . If you wish to please me , Sir , then send her the gifts you send me .
HENRY: I have shown Mary enough kindness and generosity . It 's you I want , Anne .
ANNE: beg you , my Lord , do not do this . What has changed so ?
HENRY: YOU . Do n't you see ? YOU have changed .
ANNE: But Mary is still the mother of you child . And even if she weren't..
ENRY: What ?
ANNE: How could I forget that you chose he above me when we first met ? You liked her better .
HENRY: Not true..
ANNE: Either way , I could never betray my own sister..
AN: Now I beg you , leave me . This is too difficult to bear .
HENRY: You see ! The same pain as mine ! It proves you feel the same way !
ANNE: Perhaps . But since it can never come to anything..
HENRY: Let me decide that . For now , you have given me hope .
STAFFORD: Sir Thomas ! It 's Mary.. !
SIR THOMAS: Does the King know ?
GEORGE: He 's on his way .
SIR THOMAS: Any moment , your Grace .
HENRY: Anne.. ANNE stares ahead at MARY 's bed..
ANNE: Your Grace , this is not the time..
HENRY: I love you Anne . I can not stop thinking about you . I can not eat , I can not sleep..
ANNE: But how could I ever TRUST you ? NORFOLK cranes his neck to listen..
HENRY: I vow from this moment forth I will never lie with my wife , or speak to you sister again . I will do anything you ask..
ANNE: Then do n't acknowledge the child . HENRY is thrown..
HENRY: What ?
PHYSICIAN: A boy !
SIR THOMAS: It 's a boy , your Majesty . A strong , healthy boy .
ANNE: What my sister has given you , I could , too .
NORFOLK: Damn you ! Three years we 've been working on this ! Not a single detail was left to chance ! And now , in the moment of ou greatest glory.. NORFOLK stares at ANNE..
ANNE: Or whatUncle ?
LADY ELIZABETH: Stop it ! Both of you . What shall we do about Mary ? And the child ? Or have we forgotten them already ?
ANNE: Mary should go back to her husband . Not a flicker of emotion on her face .
ADY ELIZABETH: Fine . Then you can be the one to tell her . ADY ELIZABETH stares at ANNE..
LADY ELIZABETH: I think you 've earned that privilege .
MARY: How can you show your face in here ?
ANNE: I understand you 're angry - but be assured . I did nothing , except remind him of you .
MARY: Oh , spare me . You did this deliberately . As revenge . And now you have what you wanted you probably think justice has been done .
ANNE: Well , has n't it ?
MARY: Be careful , that 's my advice . Learn from my experience . Because he 'll only do to you what he has done to me .
ANNE: Never . I 'll make sure he understands I 'm a greater thing by far . That he can never have me until he makes me a fa greater offer .
MARY: You 'll never get Henry Percy back , if that 's what you mean .
ANNE: That 's not what I mean . ANNE 's eyes burn with anger..
MARY: If that 's what you think , fine . Tell yourself that .
ANNE: I did , sister . Every day for three years . ANNE turns , and walks out .
MARY: Henry .
WILLIAM: I see . A painful smile..
MARY: He is to be Henry Carey .
WILLIAM: I see . A silence , then..
HENRY: Well , I have done what you asked . Will you give yourself to me , now ?
ANNE: As what ?
HENRY: My one true mistress . To whom I am loyal above all others ?
ANNE: But it 's not true . You are loyal to the QUEEN above all others .
HENRY: My wife ? I barely see her .
ANNE: But she sits on a throne beside you . Accompanies you to every state function .
ENRY: For appearance sakes only . In every other regard , our marriage is a sham .
ANNE: Still , she is your WIFE . And eve present . And I feel her eyes on me . And those of her spies . ANNE nervously looks left and right..
HENRY: Well , what would you have me do ?
ANNE: I 'd like to . But I 'm afraid I find the insult too much to bear .
HENRY: What insult ?
ANNE: Because as long as we remain unmarried , any child I gave you would forever be daubed ` bastard ' and I a ` whore ' .
ENRY: ut what alternative is there ? throws hands up in exasperation ) My love for the Queen may have died , but even you must concede , she is still very much alive . A
ANNE: Katherine of Aragon is alive . That woman is not worthy of the title ` Queen ' .
ENRY: Oh , Anne .
ANNE: I really do not know why we waste time talking of convents when you could annul the marriage .
HENRY: Annul it ?
ANNE: That woman married two brothers and therefore sinned against God .
HENRY: But she never consummated the marriage with my brother .
ANNE: They were married six months .
HENRY: Arthur was a sick man .
ANNE: And Katherine is a shrewd woman who knew that her position as Queen would neve e safe until she bedded your brother . Talk to your advisers . They will tell you as much . ANNE walks out . HENRY stares .
HENRY: Wolsey has agreed to charge the Queen ?
ANNE: But that 's wonderful . ANNE 's smiles , then notices..
HENRY: Because she will contest it . Which means putting her on trial . And hearing these delicate matters in public .
ANNE: es . But any court made up of YOUR Bishops will surely find in YOUR favour . And declare the marriage invalid .
TAFFORD: She 's beautiful .
MARY: Thank you .
STAFFORD: I brought gifts from your family . A night-dress from your mother . This from your Uncle George .
MARY: Please be sure to thank them - though one wonders what 's kept them so busy that not a single one of them found time to visit the new baby .
STAFFORD: It 's Anne . She 's turning this country on its head . She has persuaded the king to test the validity of his marriage , and put the QueenM on trial .
MARY: What ?
STAFFORD: She continues to hold out . Expertly witholding her favours until
MARY: ..until what ?
STAFFORD: Until he makes her the ultimate offer . MARY 's eyes widen..
MARY: High stakes indeed .
TAFFORD: Continues to be promoted . As does you Father . I lost track of their latest titles . STAFFORD smiles . Mounts his horse..
STAFFORD: ow is your husband ? I heard he was unwell .
MARY: He is .
STAFFORD: I 'm sorry .
HENRY: The Queen has insisted a Papal epresentative be present at the trial . But Wolsey has assured me the trial will proceed for appearance sake only . We have our verdict .
ANNE: Then what troubles you ?
HENRY: One or two friends have refused to lend their support . Among them , Thomas More . And then there 's the small matter of my conscience .
ANNE: Why ? You have justice on your side . HENRY stares , conflicted..
HENRY: Do I ?
SIR THOMAS: ` Mary Talbot ' .
ANNE: Who ?
SIR THOMAS: Mary Talbot ! ! The girl that married Henry Percy . It seems she has petitioned the King , demanding a divorce from he husband that his prior betrothal to you was actually.. ..consummated . ANNE 's eyes widen in horror.. ` What ? '
ANNE: I must go to the King .
SIR THOMAS: No ! He does n't want to see you ! Or hea a word from your lips ! He 's far too angry . a beat ) It seems the only Boleyn he will speak to , the only person who 's testimony he will trust in this matter.. is Mary . ANNE 's face . A dagger in her heart .
ANNE: Mary ?
SIR THOMAS: Mary .
ANNE: uch beautiful hair . earing ANNE 's voice , MARY freezes .
ANNE: Thank you for coming .
MARY: It 's fine . MARY pulls away . Raises her hand..
ANNE: I 'm frightened , Mary . What have I done ? MARY turns away . Avoids ANNE 's eyes .
HENRY: Ah ! Mary ! Come in . MARY walks closer .
MARY: ou asked to see me , your Grace ?
ANNE: And.. ?
OUNG HENRY: Mama ? What 's the matter ?
MARY: Nothing . MARY smiles , tenderly kisses YOUNG HENRY .
ANNE: I am forever in your debt .
MARY: You owe me nothing , sister . I did it that we may finally draw a line beneath everything that has happened between us .
ANNE: hen let it be exactly that . A new start etween us . Here at court . ANNE embraces MARY , who stiffens .
MARY: Thank you . But I 'd rather go back to ou home in the country .
ANNE: What ? That damp old ruin ? With no food ? Or warmth ? a beat ) Why do n't you let your family look afte you ? Your children would have the best of everything here . They would grow up safe and secure .
MARY: ho 's that ?
SIR THOMAS: The Papal Legate . Sent by the Pope to preside over the Queen 's trial .
MARY: So , it 's true . It 's really happening ?
ANNE: Yes , it is . Stay with me , please ? I need my sister by me side .
MARY: The crowds are with her .
ANNE: The crowds have no vote . a beat ) And the bishops that do are in Wolsey 's pocket .
UEEN KATHERINE: So..the Boleyn whores . Two former ladies of mine . Hiding in shadows . What did I do to upset you , that you should turn against me like this ?
ANNE: You failed to give England an heir .
QUEEN KATHERINE: And that upsets you so ?
ANNE: What upsets the King upsets me . QUEEN KATHERINE straightens . Big mistake .
QUEEN KATHERINE: How dare you !
CRIER: Katherine , Queen of England , come into court.. !
QUEEN KATHERINE: ou want me to creep away and become a nun ? Well , I shall not . You want me to lie before God and admit my first marriage was consummated ? Well , it was not .
KATHERINE: My Lord , how have I offended you ? Fo twenty years , I have been a true , obedient wife . I have loved all those whom you loved , and given you children though it has pleased God to take them away . If there is any just cause that you can allege against me , I will happily depart to my shame and dishonour , but I tell you , as God is my witness , there is none .
HENRY: You are .
KATHERINE: ..then let it be in a proper court and y the only authority I recognise . His holiness himself .
WOLSEY: Since it has pleased the Queen to absent herself from the court , the trial will simply proceed without her . A LAWYER gets to his feet . The trial begins..
ANNE: Wolsey promised the King his verdict . Instead he has humiliated him .
SIR THOMAS: But they are continuing with the trial . And the Bishops will still find in the King 's favour .
ANNE: Yes . But without the Pope 's blessing , the result will seem hollow . a frustrated gesture ) If only the King would take matters into his own hands .
ADY ELIZABETH: And do what ? His only option would be to reject the Catholic Church ? And his faith would never allow it .
SIR THOMAS: Nor his good sense . Breaking with Rome would isolate England politically . Leave us at the mercy of the Protestants .
ANNE: But the alternative is leaving this country without an heir . Failing in his duty as a King . And risking civil war . ANNE stops thinks.. ANNE
MARY: What ?
HENRY: Who 's this ?
YOUNG HENRY: My name is Henry .
HENRY: Is it , now ? A fine name . And how old are you ?
YOUNG HENRY: Four , Sir .
HENRY: I think so . Would you like to see it ?
KATHERINE: How dare you ! Take your hands off me..
HENRY: Now you will give yourself to me . ANNE looks up..
ANNE: I thought I had made myself clear . Until we are married , there is no questi..
HENRY: Silence ! Enough of your GAMES ! I have torn apart this country for you , gone against every principle in my heart , I 've endured the doubts and counsel of good men and silenced them with the axejust to be with you..
HENRY: Now prove to me it was worth the sacrifice .
ANNE: Stop , you are hurting me.. !
MARY: Tender . a beat ) Surprisingly so . a beat ) Why ? ANNE 's face . Haunted . Fearing the worst .
ANNE: No reason .
ARCHIBISHOP: Do you , Henry Tudor , take Anne Boleyn as your lawful wedded wife.. ?
HENRY: I do .
ANNE: Did you hear ? On the way to the church ? They were calling me a witch .
MARY: All that will die down as soon as they get to know you .
ANNE: But what if it does n't ? What if they hate me forever ?
MARY: They wo n't . They will see how much the King loves you , and follow .
ANNE: How much the King loves me ?
MARY: ister , I wonder if you 've given any thought..to the matter of my returning to the country . With the children .
ANNE: What ? No ! I need you here more than ever . Besides , as the Queen 's sister , you ca n't live alone out there like some gypsy . We need to make you a prope match .
STAFFORD: Wait ! Mary.. STAFFORD catches her up..
MARY: hat ? Stafford ? TAFFORD blurts it out..
STAFFORD: MaryI love you . There..I 've said it . From the moment I joined your family..
MARY: Wait..
STAFFORD: Yes .
MARY: Oh , Stafford..
STAFFORD: Mary..I have watched how your family has treated you .
MARY: But it 's impossible . You know that . Now Anne 's Queen , my family would neve allow it .
STAFFORD: And you would CARE ? What THEY think ? After everything they have done to you ? TAFFORD stares incredulously . Then goes .
ANNE: God , I look hideous .
EORGE: Does it hurt ?
ANNE: Little nips and stabs . MARY is n't listening . She is lost in thought .
GEORGE: Just imagine . It it 's a boy . The unholy trinity will be mother , uncle and aunt to the next King of England .
ANNE: But if it is n't ? The King will take that as evidence of God 's displeasure . And will turn further against me . He 's already become so cold . ANNE touches her stomach anxiously..
ANNE: You 've been like this for days .
MARY: What ?
ANNE: Mooning . You 're not in love , are you ?
MARY: What ? Certainly not.. MARY gestures dismissively..
MIDWIFE: And again , one more..
MARY: Well done
ANNE: And.. ?
MARY: It 's a girl !
ANNE: A girl ?
SIR THOMAS: She has named her Elizabeth . After you mother .
HENRY: Is the child healthy ?
SIR THOMAS: Perfectly , Sir . HENRY stares , hollow-eyed . Finally..
ENRY: Well , if we can have a healthy daughter , we can have a healthy son .
MARY: Lady Somerset , I believe .
ANNE: Yesterday it was the wife of the French Ambassador . The day before with the Countess of Salisbury . How could he DO that to me ? So SOON ? ANNE stares at MARY..
MARY: Oh , Anne..
ANNE: nd it 's getting more and more difficult to arouse him . Some nights he can not do itat all . I have to resort to eve more disgustingthen he hates himself in the morninghates me even more fo what I made him do ANNE eyes stare . She rocks back and forth..
SIR THOMAS: And.. ? The PHYSICIAN 's face he nods .
EORGE: And so , it 's come to this . Our sister is with child , and all England 's fate is in the balance . EORGE indicates ANNE.. GEORGE If it 's a boy , the King will have been vindicated in getting rid of his first wife , and his authority will be unassailable . But if it is n't . Or if , God forbid , she miscarries .
GEORGE: The King will have to move swiftly to silence his enemies . He will claim innocence . That he was corrupted . Anne will swiftly be replaced as Queen , by someone more ` acceptable ' . And we Boleyns will never be able to show our faces at court again .
MARY: That 's no bad thing .
GEORGE: ike the wise William Stafford . MARY turns
MARY: What ?
GEORGE: You did n't know ? Sold up and went . Left for the country . Just like that . Gone to live in some place called..
MARY: ..Tatton .
GEORGE: Where he grew up , apparently . Did you know he came from a better stable than all of us ? His grandmother was a Beaufort , cousin to the King . And he never mentioned it . Who 'd have guessed ?
ANNE: I 'm fine , thank you . Just a bad dream .
ANNE: I lost it . Almost without pain . And so fast it was over in a moment . MARY looks down at the bundle of sheets..
MARY: Oh , Anne..
ANNE: ou have to get rid of it . Bury it . Get id of it somehow . No one must know .
MARY: Why ? There 's still time . You could sleep with the King , and fall pregnant again . No one would know..
ANNE: he King would never lie with me now , and risk damaging the ` child ' he elieves I 'm carrying.. a beat ) Besides , he is barely capable anymore . And I could n't go through that again . ANNE stares at MARY and GEORGE..
MARY: I..I do n't understand .
ANNE: I need a baby , Mary . olling eyes ) Must I spell it out ?
MARY: You mean lying with another man ?
ANNE: Of course .
GEORGE: But that would be treason .
MARY: esides , where would you find someone you could trust ?
ANNE: Obviously , it would have to be someone close . Very close.. ANNE stares meaningfully at her BROTHER..
GEORGE: What.. ? horrified ) No.. !
MARY: Stop it , Anne ! It 's madness..
ANNE: Do n't you see ? This affects all of us . If I go down , so do all of you . The only way to save ourselves..is to do this.. And pray it 's a boy .
MARY: I ca n't listen to this.. this is monstrous..
ANNE: Mary , sit down..
MARY: No , Anne ! I understand you have had a shock tonight . A terrible shock . But there is no need for this..
MARY: Come , George.. GEORGE gets to his feet..
ANNE: George is staying . He understands this involves the whole family..
MARY: No . Come , George..
ANNE: George , is STAYING ! EORGE freezes..
MARY: I pray for you both . MARY turnsthen goes .
ANNE: Mary ! Come back !
MARY: Come on , darling wake up .
YOUNG HENRY: Where are we going ?
MARY: Away from here . Far , far away .
YOUNG HENRY: Who lives here , Mother ?
MARY: Someone . A friend .
OUNG HENRY: Mama , I 'm hungry .
CATHERINE: Me , too . MARY stares . What should she do ?
MARY: I 'm sorry . a beat ) I just did n't know where else to go . STAFFORD walks in . MARY gets up
RIEST: Do you , Mary , take William as you lawful wedded husband ?
MARY: I do .
STAFFORD: News from court . TAFFORD avoids MARY 's eyes..
MARY: hat ? It 's Anne . Tell me.. She miscarried the child ?
STAFFORD: They say it was deformedmonstrous . She is charged with incest and of summoning the devil . Your brother , too . He has already been sentenced . Anne is in the Tower , awaiting trial .
MARY: I must go .
STAFFORD: And do what ? George is doomed . For Anne it 's only a matter of time .
MARY: I can petition the King..
STAFFORD: ou think he will listen ? It 's his own neck he 's saving by getting rid of them , ca n't you see ? MARY stares..
STAFFORD: Fine , go . But if you do , you might as well kiss your children goodbye . You are Anne 's sister . That alone makes you he accomplice and co-conspirator .
MARY: I have no choice . Anne and George are my family . I can not desert them . MARY walks towards the door..
STAFFORD: And what of your new family ? You
MARY: Henry and Catherine have you . Anne and George have no one . I 'm sorry..
ANNE: It is a sad day for England when the nobles do not rise for their Queen .
NORFOLK: And even sadder when that same Queen is charged with adultery and incest .
ANNE: Charged is different to convicted , Uncle . Or is it not ? In this court ?
NORFOLK: Master Cromwell , read out the indictment.. CROMWELL gets to his feet..
CROMWELL: The charge is that in the twenty-eighth year of the reign of our Sovereign Henry , King of England , his wife , the Queen , being seduced by the Devil , did knowingly commit adultery , high treason and offences against God .
NORFOLK: How do you plead ?
ANNE: Not guilty , my Lord .
ANNE: My noble Lords..the love I have for my other is the love any sister would have for someone with whom she has grown up in the same house , nursed when sick , played games as children , shared life 's celebrations .
NORFOLK: Guilty .
MARY: ho was it ?
HENRY: Mary.. ?
ENRY: Leave us .
HENRY: ALL of you !
MARY: Your Majesty.. I understand my family has offended you . But having taken my brother today , I beg you to spare my sister .
HENRY: Oh , Mary
MARY: I realise you must replace Anne as Queen . But must she die , too ?
HENRY: She has been tried and found guilty .
MARY: You could send her away .
ENRY: I am bound by the law .
MARY: You could send her to a nunnery . No one would know .
HENRY: Anne ? To a nunnery ? HENRY almost manages a smile .
MARY: There is precedent , my Lord . Louis of France did it , too . When his wife could not conceive .
HENRY: The French Queen was a blameless woman . Your sister a witch .
MARY: I understand Anne has offended you . I ask only that if there is any regret you might..feel yourself .
ENRY: What ?
MARY: For your part in the matter..
HENRY: How could I have made that mistake ?
HENRY: o. I will reflect on the matter .
MARY: Oh , Anne..
ANNE: How has it come to this ?
MARY: Ssshhhhh .
ANNE: They 're letting the crowds in .
MARY: It 's all right . You will be spared . The King as good as gave me his word .
ANNE: The King saw you ?
MARY: Yes . ANNE manages a rueful smile..
ANNE: We all made a mess of that , did n't we ? We all underestimated little Mary . ANNE looks at MARY..
MARY: That 's not true .
ANNE: It is . He never loved me in the same way . And deep down you know it . MARY averts her eyes..
ANNE: Hold me..
MARY: It will be all right . Trust me .
ANNE: he could n't ask for a better moth MARY hugs ANNE tight.. ` Sssshhh ' .
MARY: e will spare you . I am sure of it .
ANNE: II come here to diea loyal subject..
MARY: Come on..
ANNE: ..I..I do not blame the King . Never was there a more just or goodly Lord..
MARY: No !

BUDDY: Ref do n't call it pretty soon , Snoopy 's gon na send this guy out in a body bag .
FOLEY: Anyone ever tell you why they call him Snoopy ?
BUDDY: I do n't believe it .
FOLEY: It 's Richard Ripley .
BUDDY: The Wall Street guy ? Oh , yeah . I did n't recognize him without his rug .
FOLEY: Dick the Ripper they called him , on account of all the people he ripped off .
BUDDY: What 's he doin ' here ?
GLENN: He got three years and fined fifty million dollars and wrote 'em a fucking check . Like that , fifty mil , signed his name . Whoa little help here !
FOLEY: Who you talkin ' to , Studs ? Me , o Buddy . I ca n't tell , you got those shades on .
GLENN: You guys come on this is too heavy !
FOLEY: I guess the bright glare out here made it hard to see the numbers on the weights .
GLENN: I 'll take the shades off . Just get this fuckin ' thing off me .
BUDDY: How do you know he wrote a check ?
GLENN: He told me . He works the laundry with me . The guy loves to talk .
FOLEY: Yeah , to the U.S. Attorney . I hear he olled over on all the snitches he was doing business with and got 'em all ought up .
GLENN: Hey , anybody that can write a check for fifty mil , he says anything I 'm all fucking ears . Like the other day , he tells me how he 's got all this money in foreign banks , plus around five mil in uncut diamonds at his house . He said , quote , `` Where I can put my hands on it anytime . ''
BUDDY: Cool . Where 's the guy live ?
GLENN: Detroit . Snoopy Miller told me uncut diamonds are as easy to move as cash .
FOLEY: Ever seen an uncut diamond , Studs ? They look like plain old rocks .
GLENN: So . What 's your point ?
FOLEY: My point is , that 's probably what you 're gon na end up with .
GLENN: You think he 's lying ?
FOLEY: Use your head . The guys got five million lying around his house , you eally think he 's gon na tell some motormouth he just met in prison about it ?
BUDDY: Here it comes .
FOLEY: You do n't wan na be standing there , the hacks start asking questions you do n't wan na answer .
RIPLEY: Oh , uh , right , thanks
BUDDY: Here , lem me help you with those , ma'am .
WOMAN: I did n't ask for your help , so do n't expect a tip . Buddy smiles , waves her off .
BUDDY: That 's okay , ma'am . I 'll just take your car .
FOLEY: They 're right underneath you , Pup . They dug a tunnel .
PUP: I do n't hear 'em . Where 's the tunnel come out ?
FOLEY: Second fence post from the tower out there . Go on , take a look . As Pup stares out the window
PUP: I do n't see nothing there .
FOLEY: You will directly . Keep watching .
KAREN: Hi . Karen Sisco again for Ray Nicolet . He 's not ? Could you tell him that never mind . I 'll call back .
PUP: There some car headlights out there Jesus Christ
BUDDY: What 's she doing ?
KAREN: Get your hands in the air !
BUDDY: It 's okay , honey , we 're good guys .
KAREN: What 're you doing here ?
FOLEY: I bet that 's all the hacks they send out . Otherwise nobody 's left to mind the store .
BUDDY: Why do n't we talk about it later ?
FOLEY: Why you 're just a girl . What do you do for a living you pack a shotgun ?
KAREN: I 'm a federal marshal and you 're unde arrest , both of you guys .
FOLEY: I bet I smell , do n't I ? Listen , you hop in the trunk and we 'll get out of here .
KAREN: In my bag , in the car .
FOLEY: They 're off in the cane by now chasing Cubans . I timed it to slip between the cracks , you might say .
KAREN: I believe it . You 've ruined a nine- hundred-dollar suit my dad gave me .
FOLEY: Yeah , went real nice with that twelve gauge , too . Tell me , why in the world would someone like you ever become a federal marshall ?
KAREN: The idea of going after guys like you appealed to me .
FOLEY: Guys like me , huh . Well , listen , even though I 've been celibate lately , I 'm not gon na force myself on you . I 've never done that in my life .
KAREN: You would n't have time anyway . We come to a roadblock , they 'll run the car , find out in five seconds who it elongs to .
FOLEY: If they get set up in time , which I doubt . And even if they do they 'll be looking for a buncha little Latin fellas , not a big black guy driving a Ford .
KAREN: Must be quite a pal , risk his own ass like this .
FOLEY: Who , Buddy ? Yeah . He 's a good guy . Back when we jailed together , he 'd call his sister every week without fail . She 's a born-again Christian , does bookkeeping for a televangelist . Buddy calls her up , confesses his sins , tells her about whatever bank he happened to rob .
KAREN: Buddy . That 's his given name ?
FOLEY: One I gave him , yeah . Fuck
KAREN: So , what 's your name ? It 'll be in the paper tomorrow anyway .
FOLEY: Jack Foley . You 've probably heard of me .
KAREN: Why , are you famous ?
FOLEY: Time I was convicted in California ? FBI told me I 'd robbed more banks than anyone in the computer .
KAREN: How many was that ?
FOLEY: Tell you the truth , I do n't know . I started when I was eighteen , driving for my Uncle Cully and his partner , Gus . They go into a bank this one time in Slidell , Gus jumps the counte to get the tellers and breaks his leg . All three of us ended up in Angola .
KAREN: That 's funny .
FOLEY: I thought so , too .
KAREN: It was me , I woulda left ol ' Gus on the floor .
FOLEY: I believe you would have . Another fall , I did seven years at Lompoc . And I do n't mean the place next door where some of Nixon 's people went .
KAREN: I know the difference . You were in Lompoc USP , the federal penitentiary . I 've delivered people there . So asically you 've spent half your life in prison .
FOLEY: Basically . Yeah . If I go back now , I do a full thirty years , no time off . Can you imagine looking at that ?
KAREN: I do n't have to . I do n't rob banks . He looks at her , then looks away as we
FOLEY: You do n't seem all that scared .
KAREN: Of course I am .
FOLEY: You do n't act like it .
KAREN: What do you want me to do ? Scream ? I do n't think it would help much . I 'm just gon na sit back , take it easy , and wait for you to screw up .
FOLEY: Jesus , you sound like my ex-wife .
KAREN: You were married ? All those falls , I 'm surprised you had time .
FOLEY: It was just a year , give or take a few days . I mean , it 's not like we did n't get along or anything . We had fun , we just did n't have that that thing , you know ? That spark , you know what I mean ? You got ta have that .
KAREN: Uh-huh .
FOLEY: We still talk , though .
KAREN: Sure .
FOLEY: Yeah , well , if it turns out I get shot like a dog , it 'll be in the street , not off a goddamn fence .
KAREN: You must see yourself as some kind of Clyde Barrow .
FOLEY: Oh , you mean of Bonnie and Clyde ? Hm . You ever see pictures of him , the way he wore his hat ? You could tell he had that don't-give-a-shit air about him .
KAREN: I do n't recall his hat , but I 've seen pictures of him lying dead , shot by Texas Rangers . Did you know he did n't have his shoes on ?
FOLEY: Is that right ?
KAREN: They put a hundred and eighty-seven ullet holes in Clyde , Bonnie Parke and the car they were driving . Bonnie was eating a sandwich .
FOLEY: You 're full of interesting facts , are n't you ?
KAREN: It was May , 1934 , near Gibsland , Louisiana .
FOLEY: That part in the movie where they get shot ? Warren Beatty and I ca n't think of her name .
KAREN: Faye Dunaway .
FOLEY: Yeah , I liked her in that movie about
KAREN: Network . Yeah , she was good .
FOLEY: And the guy saying he was n't gon na take any more shit from anybody
KAREN: Peter Finch .
FOLEY: Yeah , right . Anyway , that scene where Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway get shot ? I remember thinking at the time it would n't be a bad way to go , if you have to .
KAREN: Bleeding on a country road .
FOLEY: It was n't pretty after , no , but if you were in that car eating a sandwich you would n't have known what hit you . We HEAR FAINT SIRENS OS
KAREN: Nothing .
FOLEY: I mean if you did n't know who I was .
KAREN: You 'd probably tell me .
FOLEY: I 'm just saying I think if we met unde different circumstances
KAREN: You have to be kidding .
FOLEY: Another one Faye Dunaway was in I liked , i > Three Days of the Condor .
KAREN: With Robert Redford , when he was young .
FOLEY: Yeah
KAREN: I never thought it made sense , though , the way they got together so quick .
FOLEY: Really .
KAREN: I mean , romantically .
FOLEY: Uh-huh . Well , but if
BUDDY: That 's the turnpike up there . Glenn 's waiting with the other car .
FOLEY: Okay , honey , come on out of there .
KAREN: Get your hands up and turn around . u > Now .
FOLEY: Shit
BUDDY: We may as well leave her , we 're leaving the car and we got ta leave her some place anyway , what 's the difference where ?
FOLEY: She 's coming with us .
BUDDY: Jesus Christ , what were you doing in there ?
FOLEY: Get the shotgun . And her purse . I 'd like to know who she is .
BUDDY: I already looked . Her name is Karen Sisco . Like the Cisco Kid only spelled different , S-i-s-c-o .
FOLEY: Karen ? Be a good girl now , you hear ? Now , I 'm gon na open the Foley jumps at the sound of a pistol shot .
VOICE: Hey ! Coming from somewhere above them .
GLENN: Hey , Jack , good to see you , man . The fuck 're you guys shooting at ? Foley looks at Buddy .
FOLEY: Do we need him ?
BUDDY: The green-and-whites saw us . One of 'em starts thinking , what 's that ca doing there ? Ties it to the break and turns around
FOLEY: Oh , hey , Studs ? We thought you were somebody else .
GLENN: Studs . Man , I have n't heard that since Lompoc . What 's going on ?
FOLEY: Oh , nuthin ' .
KAREN: You win , Jack . `` Jack . '' Buddy gives him another funny look .
FOLEY: Have your clothes cleaned and send me the bill .
KAREN: I 'll send it to you at Glades .
GLENN: Jesus , what 'd you crawl through , a sewer ?
FOLEY: Take your sunglasses off .
GLENN: I see better with them on .
FOLEY: You do n't take 'em off , I 'm gon na throw 'em off the overpass while they 're still on your head .
GLENN: You 're in civilization now , man , ease up .
FOLEY: I 'd like you to go wait in the car . How 's that ? Take her with you and put her in back .
GLENN: In the trunk ?
FOLEY: The backseat .
GLENN: Come on . I have to do what I 'm told . She walks past Foley without looking at him .
FOLEY: Wait a minute . Let me have you aincoat . Somebody forgot to bring me clean clothes .
BUDDY: I brought 'em , they 're back at Glades in the Cadillac . You wanted to take her car .
KAREN: You can blame me if you want . I do n't mind .
GLENN: Here you are , sir .
BUDDY: What 's wrong with you ?
FOLEY: Why you brought Glenn into this , I 'll never know .
BUDDY: How 'bout the score was his idea to egin with ?
FOLEY: His idea ? Gim me a break . Fuckin ' guy 's got a vacant lot for a head . Was you and me figured the whole thing out .
BUDDY: You 're pulling at it . Here
FOLEY: I do n't know why , but every time he opens his mouth I want to punch him out .
BUDDY: He ai n't the problem , Jack . Foley looks at him .
GLENN: if he thinks he can talk to me like this . Shit , I do n't even know what I need them for .
KAREN: Glenn ?
GLENN: It could n't have been out at Glades , if that 's what you 're thinking . I was never out there .
KAREN: No , that 's not what I 'm thinking .
GLENN: But you 're sure we 've met , huh ?
KAREN: Last fall , I drove you from the Palm Beach county jail to the federal courthouse , twice . You 're Glenn Michaels . I never forget anyone I 've cuffed and shackled .
GLENN: I remember you now . Shit .
KAREN: Foley 's not going to make it . And if he goes down , Glenn , you go with him . She touches his shoulder and he jumps .
GLENN: We 're not . I 'm helping him , yeah
KAREN: Wait . Have you helped him , Glenn ? At this point , technically , I doubt you could be charged with aiding a fugitive . So you still have a choice . You can help him and risk going down again , get cuffed and shackled , hope to God you pull a reasonable judge , not some hard-on . Or , if you want to play it another way She pauses . He turns and looks at her .
GLENN: Like how ?
BUDDY: You want to take her to my place and get cleaned up ? You come out of the athroom with your after-shave on and she goes , `` Oh , I had you all wrong '' ?
FOLEY: I want to talk to her again , that 's all . See what would happen under , you know , normal circumstances .
BUDDY: You 're too late , Jack .

FOLEY: You stick anything in this guy , Snoop , they transfer his ass outta here faster ' n you can throw a fight , and you still end up with nothing . Ripley nods , takes this in .

MOSELLE: I 'm trainin ' Tuffy , so he can be on a Kal Kan commercial , make us some extra money . He looks at her .
MAURICE: That 's the dumbest thing I heard in my life . Everybody knows Kal Kan does n't pay for shit . You gon na get a gig , it 's got ta be for one of the big three Science Diet , Iams or that Cycle shit for the fat dogs . Now answer the fuckin phone . She comes over , picks up the phone .
MOSELLE: Hello ? For you .
MAURICE: This is me .
GLENN: Snoopy . Glenn Michaels .
MAURICE: Studs . Hey , son , you must be one a them psychic friends . I was just thinkin ' about you .
GLENN: Listen , Snoopy , I 'm on my way up to Detroit and need a place to crash .
MAURICE: You crazy , come up here ? It 's fuckin one degree outside .
GLENN: I wan na talk to you about a job .
MAURICE: Uh-huh .
GLENN: I ca n't really go into it right now . I 'll just tell you it 's someone big .
MAURICE: Someone ? Gim me a hint .
GLENN: It 's a guy you know .
MAURICE: Gim me another hint .
GLENN: It 's Richard Ripley . Maurice does n't say a word .
MAURICE: Oh , I 'm here , all right . I 'm very here . Question is , why are n't you here ?
FOLEY: I 'm just saying she was n't scared .
BUDDY: Cause she had her hand on her gun the whole time , waiting to make her move . Buddy opens the door , looks at Foley .
FOLEY: You 're just jealous it was me in the trunk with her and not you .
BUDDY: You 're right .
FOLEY: First thing I 'm gon na do is get all this mud off me . Foley starts for the bathroom .
BUDDY: There 's some lilac oil , you want some , a vanilla candle under the sink .
FOLEY: Oh , man .
BUDDY: There 's something about a nice hot ath , transforms a person . It 's not just about opening up your pores , know what I mean ? There 's just something about the heat and the wet that 's calming you know ? Settles me in a way that I really ca n't articulate .
FOLEY: I know exactly what you mean . It 's just a feeling . You know , I could go for some wine tonight .
BUDDY: There 's a store around the corner , I 'll be right back .
FOLEY: Sounds great .
KAREN: What ?
MARSHALL: You were talking in your sleep .
KAREN: What 'd I say ?
MARSHALL: `` Hey , yourself . ''
KAREN: Huh .
BURDON: Daniel Burdon , FBI .
MARSHALL: Marshall Sisco . Karen 's dad .
BURDON: You mind please waiting outside . We have some business to do here .
MARSHALL: I need to go to the john anyway .
KAREN: I wan na be on the task force , Daniel .
BURDON: That 's nice of you to offer , Karen , ut I got all the help I can use right now . Instead , let 's talk about how you got the bump on your head .
KAREN: Is n't that my report you 're holding onto ?
BURDON: Yes , but I want to hear you tell it . Starting with when you tried to gra the wheel where was this ?
KAREN: Coming to the Okeechobee exit And now we see it
GLENN: What am I supposed to do now ?
KAREN: Glenn , take the exit .
GLENN: No way , man , no fuckin ' way am I gon na turn myself in . She reaches over and grabs the wheel .
KAREN: The next thing I knew , the paramedics were taking me out the car . Burdon looks at Karen a moment , then
BURDON: There 's a couple of points I keep wondering about have to do with the two guys that grabbed you . Buddy is it ? And this fella Jack Foley . I swear the man must 've robbed two hundred anks in his time .
KAREN: Really ? Huh . He told me he did n't emember how many he robbed .
BURDON: You talked to him ?
KAREN: In the trunk , yeah ?
BURDON: What 'd you talk about ?
KAREN: Oh different things , prison , movies .
BURDON: This fella holds you hostage , you talk about movies ?
KAREN: It was an unusual experience .
BURDON: Foley made me think of that fella Carl Tillman , the one you were seeing , it turns out the same time he was doing anks . You recall that ?
KAREN: When I was seeing Carl Tillman , I did n't know he robbed banks .
BURDON: Yeah , but I had enough reason to believe he did , and I told you . So you had to at least suspect him .
KAREN: And what happened to Carl ?
BURDON: The time came , you shot him . But you did n't shoot Foley or the guy with him . They 're unarmed , you had a shotgun and you let them throw you in the trunk . Okay , now you got your Sig in you hand . You say in the report you could n't turn around , he had you pinned down . But when the trunk opened , how come you did n't cap the two guys then ?
KAREN: Is that what you would 've done ?
BURDON: You say in the report Glenn did n't have a gun , but you let him get away , too .
KAREN: Daniel , what do you work on most of the time , fraud ? Go after crooked ookkeepers .
BURDON: Karen , I 've been with the Bureau fifteen years , on all kinds of investigations .
KAREN: Have you ever shot a man ? How many times have you been primary through the door ?
BURDON: I have to qualify , is that it ?
KAREN: You have to know what you 're talking about .
BURDON: We 'll talk another time , Karen . All ight ? I 'd like to know why Foley put you in that second car when he did n't need you any more .
KAREN: You 'll have to ask him .
BURDON: Sounds to me like he liked having you around . I 'll see you , Karen . Mr. Sisco .
MARSHALL: Agent Burdon . Marshall waits for him to walk out
KAREN: The Sig Sauer you got me for my irthday .
MARSHALL: Tell you what , you 're a good girl , you might get another one for Christmas . She looks at him .
KAREN: I 'll get it back when I get Foley .
OLD WOMAN: Oh Are you delivering the oxygen ?
BUDDY: Uh , no , ma'am . Sorry .
KAREN: You win , Jack .
BUDDY: You made the front page .
FOLEY: I was n't feeling my best that day . I 'd just drawn thirty to life .
BUDDY: Maybe this 'll make you feel better .
FOLEY: Thanks .
BUDDY: Paper says there 's ten grand each on you , Chino and Lulu .
FOLEY: Say anything in there about Karen Sisco ?
BUDDY: Just that she got away .
FOLEY: Yeah , but what happened after she drove off with Glenn ?
BUDDY: You 'll have to ask Glenn . And most likely , he 's on his way to Detroit , where we should be .
FOLEY: Think this old guy is her boyfriend ? It 's the only picture she carries .
BUDDY: Am I going to Detroit by myself ? Foley picks up her drivers licence photo .
FOLEY: We 'll leave first thing in the morning .
KAREN: He does n't even look like that .
MARSHALL: No ?
KAREN: No , he looks a lot She realizes Marshall 's watching her .
RAY: You look great . Your dad taking good care of you ?
KAREN: He took the week off so we 'd have time together . So far he 's worked on his oat every day . Dad ? Ray Nicolet . Marshall gets up , shakes his head .
RAY: I 've heard a lot about you , Mr. Sisco .
MARSHALL: Likewise .
KAREN: Ray 's with the F.B.I . Task Force , working on the prison break .
MARSHALL: I see that .
RAY: No . Course not .
KAREN: How 's it going ?
RAY: Great . We got one of 'em . Karen looks at him .
KAREN: Was it Foley ?
MARSHALL: Off a tip ?
RAY: Yeah , someone spotted two of 'em in this hobo camp out by the airport , called the number
MARSHALL: I knew it , soon as I saw they were offering a reward . She grabs Nicolet by the arm .
KAREN: Was it Foley ? < /u Marshall looks at her .
RAY: Foley ? Oh . No , it was one of the Cubans . Linares .
KAREN: Oh
RAY: We went out there , full SWAT , two choppers , the whole bit , but Linares started shooting anyway . We put him down , but somehow Chirino got away .
MARSHALL: Did you pay the guy the reward ?
RAY: Yeah , as soon as we got back .
KAREN: Foley had n't been there ? Her father gives her a look .
RAY: This place was strictly Cuban . If Foley had a ride he must have his own agenda . He seems to be the only one knows what he 's doing . THE PHONE RINGS . Marshall moves to it .
MARSHALL: Hello ? Yeah , she is . Just a minute . For you .
KAREN: Hello ?
FOLEY: Hi .
KAREN: Yes . She walks out to her father 's balcony now .
FOLEY: I just wanted to see if you 're okay , make sure Glenn did n't hurt you or , you know , anything .
MARSHALL: Something I 've been wondering , Ray Marshall picks up the newspaper
KAREN: How 'd you get this number ?
FOLEY: Who was it answered the phone ?
KAREN: None of your business .
FOLEY: I 'm just worried maybe I 'm not old enough for you .
KAREN: That 's my dad .
FOLEY: Really . He has a cop 's face .
KAREN: How do you know ? Wait you have my wallet .
FOLEY: And your gun .
KAREN: Think I could have them back ?
FOLEY: How do we do that ?
KAREN: Let 's see . You could come on by my dad 's place , drop 'em off .
FOLEY: Sure . I 'll just leave 'em with the S.W.A.T . guy answers the door .
KAREN: There 's a guy here on the task force ight now . Maybe I should put him on the phone , let you two work it out .
FOLEY: You wo n't do that .
KAREN: Why not ?
FOLEY: Because you 're having too much fun .
MARSHALL: She fixes him pork chops and rice , the next thing you know they 're making love on the sofa . She says he was very gentle .
RAY: I spoke to her . The guy told her he missed his little girl and she felt sorry for him .
MARSHALL: That 's how you score now ?
KAREN: My dad 's retired . He was a Private Investigator . Forty years . I used to work for him .
FOLEY: I can just picture that , a cute girl like you following slip-and-fall and whiplash cheaters .
KAREN: Something I 've been wondering , what ever happened to your Uncle Cully ?
FOLEY: Why ? You think he might tell you where I am ?
KAREN: Unless you wan na tell me .
FOLEY: He 's dead . He did twenty-seven years efore he came out and died not too long after in Charity Hospital , I think trying to make up for all the good times he 'd missed . That 's not gon na be me .
KAREN: One last score , that the idea ? Move to some island .
FOLEY: I 'm partial to mountains myself . But if you like islands , we 'll make it an island .
FOLEY: I just thought maybe you and me could
BUDDY: Who you talking to ?
KAREN: Is that Buddy ?
FOLEY: What ? !
BUDDY: You better come see this .
RAY: The woman also said he stole he husband 's gun , a twenty-two pistol , and some of his clothes .
MARSHALL: So the woman 's married . She goes to ed with this prison escapee because he misses his little girl and then tells the world about it . But you do n't reveal her name , you protect her . It sounds like you 're saying it 's okay as long as her husband does n't find out about it . Like the guy who cheats on his wife , saying what she does n't know wo n't hurt her .
KAREN: Dad .
MARSHALL: What ?
FOLEY: Chino 's gon na wan na talk to me .
BUDDY: He 's running for his life , he does n't give a shit about you .
FOLEY: He 's got ta know by now that I gave him up back at Glades . He does , he 's gon na try to find me . Maybe go see Adele , see what she knows .
BUDDY: He knows where she lives ?
FOLEY: We were talking one time , drinking um . I may 've mentioned Adele , how she worked for a magician . Chino got interested . He 's like , Yeah ? How does he saw the woman in half ? He wanted to meet her . Or get a look at her if she ever came to visit .
BUDDY: So call her up . Tell her do n't talk to any Cubans .
FOLEY: Her phone 's probably tapped .
BUDDY: And you know they 're gon na have some people watching the hotel .
FOLEY: Shit .
MARSHALL: Remember , pay attention to how she talks about Foley , her tone . Do it ight , she 'll tell you things she would n't tell Burdon . Tell her you think he 's a nice guy . No , first tell her about being in the trunk with him , in the dark for half an hour , and see how she takes it . If she 's in on it , what does she get for all the aggravation ; cops breathing on her ? I et nothing . So she still likes him enough to stick her neck out . You think that 's possible ? What kind of guy is he ?
KAREN: He 's pretty laid back , confident .
MARSHALL: He remind you of that guy , Tillman ?
KAREN: Not at all .
MARSHALL: But you know he 's dirty and you still wan na see him again .
KAREN: I want to bust his ass , put him in shackles .
MARSHALL: Maybe . But you 're also curious about the man . Twice last night you asked your married boyfriend Nicolet about him . You were concerned , but you did n't want to show it .
KAREN: My married boyfriend - setting him up with that news story so you could talk about infidelity . I could n't believe it .
MARSHALL: You like the wild ones , do n't you ? Tillman , Nicolet and now Foley . You know , I 've always said there 's a thin line between the cowboy cops and the armed robbers , all those guys that love to pack .
KAREN: Foley kidnapped me .
MARSHALL: Yeah , but you talked all the way from GCI to the turnpike . It sounds more like a first date than a kidnapping .
ADELE: Hi , this is Adele speaking .
CHINO: Oh , is this Adele ?
BUDDY: Nice disguise .
FOLEY: I 'm a tourist .
BUDDY: You at least bring the gun ?
FOLEY: In here with my suntan lotion and beach towel . That 's her place .
BUDDY: There . You see the guy sitting on the porch ? The old ladies and one guy ? You know they 'll have a couple more in a car somewhere .
FOLEY: Uh-huh Buddy follows Foley 's gaze to
BUDDY: Oh , my .
FOLEY: I guess Adele 's in good hands .
BUDDY: Sure looks that way .
FOLEY: Let 's go to Detroit .
BUDDY: Now you 're talkin ' .
ADELE: You were both in the trunk ? Together ?
KAREN: From Glades to the turnpike . Then I left with Glenn .
ADELE: They did n't tell me anything , they asked questions .
KAREN: But you know what I 'm talking about , do n't you ? About Glenn , do n't you , and the second car ?
ADELE: I know a Glenn .
KAREN: No , thanks .
ADELE: Those are cute shoes . The kind of jobs I get , I have to wear these kille spikes , they ruin your feet . She walks away , comes back with an ashtray .
KAREN: You mean , did he try to jump me ? No , ut he was kind of talkative .
ADELE: He gets that way when he 's nervous sometimes .
KAREN: You did n't visit him in prison .
ADELE: He did n't want me to .
KAREN: Why not ?
ADELE: I do n't know . He was different afte he was sentenced , looking at thirty years . Said it depressed him every time the younger cons called him an old timer .
KAREN: But you spoke to him on the phone .
ADELE: He 'd call every once in a while .
KAREN: He called the day he escaped .
ADELE: He did ? I do n't remember . Did he say about me ? In the trunk ?
KAREN: He said he wished the two of you could start over , live a normal life .
ADELE: Huh . Problem is , Jack 's idea of a normal life is robbing banks . It 's all he 's ever done .
KAREN: Did you know that when you married him ?
ADELE: He said he was a card player . I could live with that . I never knew he robbed anks till he got busted with that ca that caught fire if you can imagine something like that happening , comes out of the bank and the car 's on fire . I did go see him in jail to tell him I was filing for divorce . He said , `` Okay . '' Jack 's so easy going . He was fun , but never what you 'd call a real husband .
KAREN: Really . Hm . She realizes Adele is looking at her .
ADELE: Buddy 'll take care of him . Keep him out 've trouble . He 's Jack 's conscience . Always has been . He tell you how they met ? Karen shakes her head .
KAREN: Till they got busted .
ADELE: That was n't Jack 's fault . No , that was on account of Buddy , for some eason , decided to call his sister and confess to a job before they 'd done it instead of after . She called the FBI and they both went down , ended up at Lompoc . I think Buddy felt kinda bad about that .
KAREN: Any idea where I could find Buddy ? O Glenn ?
CHINO'S VOICE: Adele ? You in there ?
ADELE: Yes .
CHINO: I want to speak with you , please .
ADELE: Who is it ?
CHINO'S VOICE: I talk to the guy you work for , Emil . He tole me your number and where you live . See , I 'm looking for an assistant and would like to speak to you .
ADELE: Oh . Uh-huh .
CHINO'S VOICE: You did work for Emil , right ?
ADELE: Yeah , I was Emil 's box-jumper for almost four years .
CHINO'S VOICE: You were his what , his box ?
ADELE: His assistant .
CHINO'S VOICE: Yes , around here . I was a mayishan in Cuba before I come here . Manuel the Mayishan was my name . And now Karen and Adele look at each other .
ADELE: I 'm not dressed .
CHINO'S VOICE: Listen to me . I 'm a good friend of Jack Foley .
KAREN: Ask him his name .
ADELE: Who are you ?
CHINO'S VOICE: Jose Chirino . Karen brings her Beretta out of the bag .
KAREN: Tell him to wait in the hall , you have to get dressed . Say it loud .
ADELE: Wait in the hall ! I have to get dressed !
CHINO'S VOICE: Tell me where is Jack Foley , I do n't other you no more .
ADELE: I do n't know where he is .
CHINO'S VOICE: Listen , I 'm the one help Jack escape from prison . He tole me , I ca n't find him to see you . So why do n't you open this fucking door . Okay ? So we can speak .
ADELE: Go away , or I 'll call the police .
CHINO'S VOICE: Why you want to do that , to a frien ' ? Adele says nothing . Then
KAREN: Go in the bedroom and
CHINO: Wait . You not Adele ?
KAREN: I 'm a federal marshal and you 're unde arrest . Put the gun on the table . I mean , now .
CHINO: Oh . Then this must be Adele He now aims the gun point-blank at Adele .
KAREN: Put it down or I 'll shoot .
CHINO: You would n't shoot me , would you ?
KAREN: What do you want to bet ?
CHINO: I could walk out of here .
KAREN: If you move , if you look at her again , you 're dead .
CHINO: Oh , is that right ? You going to shoot me ? Nice girl like you ? I do n't think so .
KAREN: You do n't , huh ?
CHINO: What ? !
KAREN: Daniel Burdon , please . Karen Sisco .
CHINO: Excuse me , Adele ?
ADELE: Yes .
CHINO: You do the sawing of the box in half trick with you inside ?
ADELE: Yes .
CHINO: Tell me , how do you do that ?
KAREN: Shut up .
ADELE: You 're good .
KAREN: Thank you .
FOLEY: First thing we do , we get to Detroit , we find Glenn , then we find a window to throw him out of .
BUDDY: I been thinkin ' , if I was Glenn , I was up there to take down the Ripper , where would I go ?
FOLEY: Well , first off , if you were Glenn , you would n't be thinking .
BUDDY: Remember Snoopy Miller , his old pal from Lompoc ?
FOLEY: Snoopy . Christ , I thought he 'd be ain dead by now .
BUDDY: He is n't fighting no more . Glenn told me the Snoop 's been managing some guys up there now , works out at the Kronk .
BURDON: You get the key ?
KAREN: They 're in 7D .
BURDON: I want two men outside , front and back . Conway and Jessup go on up to seven , cover both ends of the hall .
KAREN: You 're gon na use a ram ?
BURDON: Yeah , why ?
KAREN: The manager 's door is metal . They all look at her .
FOURTH MAN: I got a shock-lock round in my shotgun oughta do the trick .
BURDON: Fine . Whatever . He sees the elevator still has n't come down .
KAREN: What ? Daniel , I wan na go upstairs .
BURDON: You can go wait out in the car , you want to . She does n't say anything .
KAREN: Call and tell you .
BURDON: And you let them come up . You do n't try to make the bust yourself . You understand ?
OLD WOMAN: Are you delivering the oxygen ?
BUDDY: Is this your floor , mother ?
OLD LADY: Oh . Yes , it is .
OLD GENT: Like to play some gin ?
KAREN: No , thank you . He creeps off towards the elevator .
OLD GENT: Going up ?
BUDDY: Let 's just hope there 's no one in the garage .
FOLEY: She looked right at me . She did n't yell or get excited . She did n't move .
BUDDY: They know where I live , I guess they know what I drive , so maybe we should pick up another car on the way .
FOLEY: She just sat there , looking right at me .
MARSHALL: He waved to you ?
KAREN: I could n't swear to it , but I 'm pretty sure he did .
MARSHALL: You wave back ?
KAREN: I did n't have time .
MARSHALL: I imagine you would 've though . She shakes her head .
KAREN: Buddy 's sister Regina Mary Bragg got two calls from Buddy up in Detroit this morning , called Burdon . She 's also the one gave Burdon Buddy 's address .
MARSHALL: So ?
KAREN: So what I want to know is why Buddy still calls his sister every week even after she turned him in .
MARSHALL: He does n't seem to hold a grudge . What I want to know is why , they got such a big score up north , did Foley hang around Miami for so long ? Any thoughts on that one ?
KAREN: None I 'd like to share . She gives him a kiss
MAURICE: I 've diversified since the last time you saw me . I 've vertically integrated and now I 'm into home invasions and the occasional grand larceny . Glenn just nods , stares out the window .
GLENN: Sure , right , they see Bigfoot driving around a black guy wearing shades and a lavender fucking bandanna , no , they wo n't think anything of it .
MAURICE: It 's lilac , man , the color , and the style 's made known by Deion and othe defensive backs in the pros . I could e one of them living out here with doctors of my race and basketball players . Okay , here comes Mr. Ripley 's house up on the left . Yeah . The brick wall . There 's his drive , right there .
GLENN: If they 're not busted now , they 're gon na be . It 's wide open .
MAURICE: I 'll show you , soon as I get one more guy I 'm gon na need , Moselle 's brother , Kenneth . Along with White Boy there .
GLENN: What ?
MAURICE: You get everything ?
KENNETH: The one gon na help us rip off the rich guy ?
MAURICE: That 's right .
GLENN: Help you
MAURICE: You just ask me how we gon na do it . That 's what I 'm here for , tell you how . We the experts . Glenn ca n't believe this is happening .
GLENN: Me ?
MAURICE: Yeah . If you can step up and actually do it . Understand ? 'Stead of just talking the talk .
GLENN: Can I do what ?
MAURICE: Walk in a house with me , do this cross- dressin ' nigga named Eddie Solomon I used to sell to been dealin ' on his own .
GLENN: What when ?
MAURICE: Right now , son .
GLENN: I do n't have to prove shit to you .
MAURICE: Look , Glenn , I know you cool , but you do n't have to give me no tone of voice , okay ? You do n't like what I 'm saying , you can get out anywhere along here you want .
GLENN: I think you 're forgetting , this is my car . I drove it up here .
MAURICE: Hey , shit , come on . I say I want this car , man , it 's mine . You go get yourself another one . I say I 'm in on Ripley ? I 'm in , with or without your < /i ass . I say I want you to come along on another job , see if you for real o not , guess what you gon na do ?
RIPLEY: Tell me something . What 's it like , walk in a bank with a gun , stick it up ?
FOLEY: I do n't know . I never used a gun .
RIPLEY: Really ?
FOLEY: You 'd be surprised what all you can get , you ask for it the right way .
RIPLEY: You 're the reason , Jack , I do n't keep all my money in banks .
FOLEY: No ? Where do you keep it , Dick ? I 'm talking about all those uncut diamonds you told Glenn about .
RIPLEY: I know what you 're talking about .
FOLEY: You 're the one with balls , Dick , say something like that to someone like Glenn . Or maybe you just forgot where you were for a minute .
RIPLEY: Yeah , but who 's gon na believe Glenn ? I mean , do you believe Glenn ?
FOLEY: Of course not .
RIPLEY: Plus , even it was true , he 'd still have to figure out where I keep 'em .
FOLEY: Does n't have to figure out shit . You u > told him you keep 'em at your house .
RIPLEY: It 's a big house .
FOLEY: Twenty-two months , three days , two hours . Why ?
RIPLEY: I was just thinking that I could use a guy like you , someone knows how to ask for things the right way . I 'm talkin ' about when you 're outta here . I mean , you ca n't rob banks for ever . Foley looks at Ripley .
FOLEY: It 's a little late for me .
RIPLEY: Hey , Jack ? Bullshit . I did n't make my first million until I was forty- two . Forty-two . You really want to change , it 's never too late .
FOLEY: I do n't know . I 'm not exactly the nine-to-five type .
RIPLEY: Who is ? But then you got ta look at a job as more than just work . You got ta look at it as peace of mind . As i > security , you know what I mean ? I got offices in Detroit , Miami , Boston , take your pick .
FOLEY: My ex-wife 's in Miami . It 's nice down there .
RIPLEY: No need to decide now . Be like the fish . Let whatever happens happen .
FOLEY: The fish ?
RIPLEY: Yeah , fish live in the present . They do n't dwell on yesterday and they do n't worry about tomorrow . Even when a big fish attacks a little fish , there 's no neurosis involved . No guilt afterward . No whining on some fish-shrink 's couch . They just do it . They accept .
FOLEY: I ca n't say that I 've paid that much attention to 'em before .
RIPLEY: The fish saved my life . Two years ago , I found out I had high blood pressure . So my doctor , he tells me to go get an aquarium , look at the fish every time I felt myself stressing out .
FOLEY: And the guy sent you a bill for this ?
RIPLEY: It works . You should try it sometime .
FOLEY: The next time I walk into a bank . Ripley shakes his head , then gets up
RIPLEY: Think about my offer , Jack . Foley watches him go .
FOLEY: What ?
BUDDY: You see this one
FOLEY: Love is funny .
BUDDY: Hey
MAURICE: Was a time you see a gold Mercedes over in the parking lot has a license plate on it say HITMAN ? You know Tommy Hearns is inside . Seeing the car would get our juices flowing . Maurice looks at Glenn now and grins .
GLENN: Why 'd he have to do that to that girl ?
MAURICE: Yeah , Kenneth , why you have to do that to that poor girl .
KENNETH: Do what ? Glenn says nothing , just looks at Kenneth .
MAURICE: Just wait till we get inside Ripley 's house .
GLENN: It 's all right with you , I 'll just hang in the car .
MAURICE: No . You gon na stay close to me from now on . So you do n't disappear on me .
GLENN: Why would I do that ?
MAURICE: Was worse than you imagined , was n't it ? Baby , you with the bad boys now .
BUDDY: Whatta you think ?
FOLEY: I think Glenn opened his big mouth and now we got us another partner .
BUDDY: Or two .
MAURICE: Stick and jab !
VOICE: Hey , Studs , how you doing ?
GLENN: Jesus Christ , what 're you guys doing here ? They sit down on either side of him , close .
FOLEY: Were n't you expecting us ?
GLENN: That broad you picked up did you know she was a US Marshal , for Christ sake ?
FOLEY: Yeah ? She said that to you ?
GLENN: I do n't know Foley notices the blood on Glenn 's shirt .
FOLEY: Whose blood you got all over you ?
GLENN: These guys , man , they 're crazy . Shit .
FOLEY: Is that Snoopy ? In the purple doo ag ?
BUDDY: What 's he do now , tell fortunes ?
MAURICE: Jack Foley , famous bank robber .
FOLEY: Snoopy Miller , famous fight thrower .
MAURICE: It seems to me I been reading about you in the newspaper . Busted out of some joint in Florida , huh ?
FOLEY: Low class of people there , Snoop .
BUDDY: What ? You mean Snoop ?
MAURICE: Nobody calls me Snoop no more or Snoopy , is what White Boy 's trying to say . He 's a little crude , you understand . No , I left that Snoopy shit behind me .

KAREN: Listen , Raymond , a year ago , DEA had this guy Glenn Michaels on possession with intent but could n't make it stick . In his statement , Glenn said he went up to Detroit to visit a friend and look into job opportunities if you can believe that .
CRUZ: Who was the friend ?
KAREN: Guy named Maurice Miller , also known as Snoopy , a former prizefighter .
CRUZ: Christ , I know Snoopy Miller . He 's a fuckin ' wackjob thinks he 's Sugar Ray Leonard . Hangs out with a couple othe Grade-A nutcases over on the West side .
KAREN: I 'll need a last known address .
CRUZ: That 's fine , but I do n't want you to talk to Miller alone .
KAREN: Come on , Raymond , I 'm a federal officer , I 'm armed . He turns and looks at her .
CRUZ: Yes , you are . I 'll call you tomorrow with the address . As he gets into his car , we then
FOLEY: It 's a terrific shot of her .
BUDDY: Outside of that .
FOLEY: Does n't say what she 's doing up here , ut I do n't think it has anything to do with us .

KENNETH: How you know that ?
KAREN: I can tell .
KENNETH: I was He moves his head in what might be a feint .
KAREN: What 'd you fight , middleweight ?
KENNETH: Light to super-middleweight , as my ody developed . You go about what , antam ?
KAREN: Flyweight .
KENNETH: You know your divisions . You like the fights ? Like the rough stuff ? Yeah , I bet you do . Like to get down and tussle a little it ?

KAREN: You wanted to tussle , we tussled .
BUDDY: Now that 's a really big house .
FOLEY: Jesus , look at that wall . Place almost looks like a prison .
BUDDY: No doubt the man 's got some big-ass security system .
FOLEY: Time comes , we knock on the door . See if he wants to talk about old times . Go in the easy way .
BUDDY: Yeah ? You think he 'll let us in , we got Snoopy and the muscle-bound asshole with us ?
FOLEY: Who says anybody 's gon na be with us ? I say we go to the fights tomorrow , find out what the Snoop 's big plan is , then go in ahead of those guys u > alone .

FOLEY: Tell me something , Buddy . You know anyone who 's actually done one last ig score and gone to live the good life ? Cause it occurred to me that everyone talks about doing it , but I do n't know anyone who 's actually gone and done it . Do you ?
BUDDY: What about that D.B . Cooper guy ? Foley looks at him .
FOLEY: Let fate decide ? What 're you , the fuckin ' Dali Lama now ?
BUDDY: My sister believes in fate , but not hell . That 's why she stopped praying for the lost souls since you do n't hear that much about purgatory anymore . But every day she asks her boss to pray I do n't fuck up . Whatta you think , you think there 's a hell , Jack ?
FOLEY: Yeah , it 's called Glades Correctional Institution and I 'm sure as shit not going back there or any place like it .
BUDDY: You might not have a choice . Foley looks at him .
FOLEY: They put a gun on you , you still have a choice , do n't you ?
MR. HEARN: Now Mr Ripley and I have had a long discussion about your role in the company and it was his feeling that you would be happiest working down here in Miami . How 's that sound to you ?
FOLEY: Great . Mr. Hearn pauses , looks down at Foley
MR. HEARN: You 're about a 42 long , right ?
FOLEY: What ?
MR. HEARN: Okay . Let 's see how she fits .
FOLEY: What is this ?
MR. HEARN: Your uniform .
FOLEY: My what ?
RIPLEY: Jack ? Whoa what 's the problem ? Take it easy , let 's talk
FOLEY: A security guard ? Are you fucking kidding me ? Ripley considers Foley a moment , then
RIPLEY: You know , I was n't sure you 'd show up . But I was pretty sure that , if you did , you 'd throw the job in my face . Understand something , Jack . Up to this point , everything you 've done with your life means absolutely nothing in the real world . Less than nothing . Foley says nothing .
FOLEY: How , Dick ? The way you earned it ? By marrying some rich broad owns the company , selling it off a piece at a time , then divorcing her ? What is this Knute Rockne , pull yourself up by the bootstraps bullshit ? Back in prison , guy like you , place like that , you were ice cream for freaks . You were a goddamn dumpling . Maurice and a dozen other guys coulda bled you till you had nothing . Till you were < /u nothing . I saved your ass . So you 'll pardon me if I do n't wan na sit on a fuckin stool all day saying `` sign in here please '' or `` hey , pal , you ca n't park there . '' Okay , Dick ? I ca n't do it .
RIPLEY: Jack , I 'm disappointed . I guess I misjudged you .
FOLEY: Hey , what job he promise you guys ?
GUARD: There 's two ways we can do this .
FOLEY: Yeah ? What are they ?
RIPLEY: Gentlemen . I think we 've calmed down now . Have n't we , Jack ?
FOLEY: Oh , yeah , I 'm calm . In fact , I 'm totally `` relaxed ''
BUDDY: Yeah , and I better call my sister .
KAREN: Jack Daniel 's , please , water on the side .
WAITRESS: They want to buy you a drink .
KAREN: I get that . Tell them I 'd rather pay for my own .
EXECUTIVE GUY: Excuse me . My associates and I made a et on what you do for a living .
KAREN: If it 's okay with you , Philip , I 'd like to just have a quiet drink and leave . Okay ?
PHILIP: Do n't you want to know what I guessed ? How I know what you do for a living ?
KAREN: Tell you the truth , I 'm not even mildly curious . Really , I do n't want to be ude , Philip , I 'd just like to be left alone .
ANDY: We 're ad guys . We flew in from New York this morning to pitch Hiram Walke Distillery , present this test-market campaign for their new margarita mix . What we do , we show this guy who looks like a Mexican bandido , you know , with the big Chihuahua hat , the bullet belts
KAREN: Andy ? Really . Who gives a shit ? He gives her a sympathetic expression .
ANDY: Want to tell me what happened ?
KAREN: Beat it , will you ?
VOICE: Can I buy you a drink ?
KAREN: Yeah , I 'd love one . Would you like to sit down ?
FOLEY: I 'm Gary . She hesitates , then shakes his hand
KAREN: I 'm Celeste .
FOLEY: I can go to the bar .
KAREN: Do n't leave me .
FOLEY: Those guys bother you ?
KAREN: No , they 're all right . I meant , you just got here .
FOLEY: You like bourbon ?
KAREN: Love it .
FOLEY: Well , we got that out of the way . Tell me , Celeste . What do you do fo a living ?
KAREN: I 'm a sales rep . I came here to call on a customer and they gave me a hard time because I 'm a girl .
FOLEY: Is that how you think of yourself ?
KAREN: What , as a sales rep ?
FOLEY: A girl .
KAREN: I do n't have a problem with it .
FOLEY: I like your hair . And that suit .
KAREN: I had one just like it well , it was the same idea , but I had to get rid of it .
FOLEY: You did ?
KAREN: It smelled .
FOLEY: Having it cleaned did n't help , huh ?
KAREN: No . What do you do for a living , Gary ?
FOLEY: How far do we go with this ? This stops her , throws her off balance .
KAREN: Not yet . Do n't say anything yet . Okay ?
FOLEY: I do n't think it works if we 're somebody else . You know what I mean ? Gary and Celeste , Jesus , what do they know about anything ?
KAREN: It 's your game . I 've never played this before .
FOLEY: It 's not a game . Something you play .
KAREN: Well , does it make sense to you ?
FOLEY: It does n't have to , it 's something that happens . It 's like seeing a person you never saw before you could be passing on the street you look at each other and for a few seconds , there 's a kind of recognition . Like you both know something . But then the next moment the person 's gone , and it 's too late to do anything about it , ut you remember it because it was ight there and you let it go , and you think , `` What if I had stopped and said something ? '' It might happen only a few times in your life .
KAREN: Or once . They look at each other a moment , then
FOLEY: Why do n't we get out of here .
KAREN: How 'd you find me ?
FOLEY: I called your room from downstairs .
KAREN: If I had answered , what were you gon na say ?
FOLEY: Well , I 'd say who I was and do you emember me and ask if you 'd like to meet for a drink .
KAREN: If I remembered you . I came looking for you . I would 've said sure , let 's do it . But for all you knew I could show up with a SWAT team . Why would you trust me ?
FOLEY: It would be worth the risk .
KAREN: You like taking risks .
FOLEY: So do you . He kisses her now , puts his arms around her .
KAREN: What 's the hurry , Jack ? You have to e somewhere ?
FOLEY: That 's not what you were about to say .
KAREN: Remember how talkative you were ? In the trunk ? Adele said you do that when you 're nervous .
FOLEY: She did , huh .
KAREN: You kept touching me , feeling my thigh .
FOLEY: Yeah , but in a nice way .
KAREN: He killed a police officer . He stops . Looks at her .
FOLEY: I hear he did n't mean to . The cop fell as Dillinger was aiming at his leg and got him through the heart .
KAREN: You believe that ?
FOLEY: Why not ?
KAREN: You know that Sig .380 you took was my favourite . My father gave it to me . As he kisses her on the neck .
FOLEY: I do n't know . I had n't worked that part out yet . All I knew was that I liked you , and I did n't want to leave you there , never see you again .
KAREN: You waved to me in the elevator .
FOLEY: I was n't sure you caught that .
KAREN: I could n't believe it . I was thinking of you by then , a lot , wondering what it would be like if we did meet . Like if we could take a time-out
FOLEY: Really ? I was thinking the same thing . If we could call time and get togethe for a while . They look at each other a moment .
KAREN: Where ?
FOLEY: Outside Adele 's . He starts to kiss her again , but
KAREN: You were going to see her ?
FOLEY: To warn her about Chino .
KAREN: So she did help you ?
FOLEY: I do n't think we should get into that .
KAREN: No , you 're right . Or Buddy . I wo n't ask if he 's with you or what you 're doing here in Detroit . Or if you 've un into Glenn Michaels yet .
FOLEY: Do n't talk like that , okay ? You scare me .
KAREN: Come on .
FOLEY: My God , look at you .
FOLEY: You coming back ?
KAREN: I 'm just going to the bathroom .
FOLEY: Why are you mad ?
KAREN: Or I did it for some kind of kinky thrill . Score with a bank robber the way some women go for rough trade .
FOLEY: What about my motive ? Now I can say I fucked a US Marshal . You think I will ?
KAREN: I do n't know .
FOLEY: I know of a guy he goes in the bank holding a bottle he says is nitroglycerin . He scores some cash off a teller , he 's on his way out when he drops the bottle . It shatters on the tile floor , he slips in the stuff , cracks his head and they 've got him . The nitro was canola oil . I know more fucked-up bank robbers than ones that know what they 're doing . I doubt one in ten can tell a dye pack when he sees one . Most bank robbers are fucking morons . To go to bed with a bank robbe for kinky thrills , as you say , you 'd have to be as dumb as they are . I know you 're not dumb , so why would I think that ? Why would you think I might think that ? She comes over and sits down on the bed .
KAREN: You 're not dumb .
FOLEY: I do n't know about that . You ca n't do three falls and think you have much of a brain .
KAREN: I 'm trying not to . I just wan na know what 's gon na happen .
FOLEY: You know . And he kisses her .
KAREN: Oh , for Christ sake , grow up .
BUDDY: It took you , what , seven hours to buy a pair of shoes ?
FOLEY: I saw Karen Sisco . Buddy turns to him .
BUDDY: And she saw you ?
FOLEY: Yes , she did .
BUDDY: So how 's that work , a wanted felon socializing with a U.S . Marshal ?
FOLEY: You know how I felt about her .
BUDDY: Did you give her a jump ? If you did I might begin to understand where you head 's at .
FOLEY: It was n't about getting laid . I just wanted to know what might 've happened if things were different .
BUDDY: You find out ?
FOLEY: Yeah , I did .
BUDDY: So what 's that mean ? That you 're disappointed by what you found or you 're sorry you robbed all those banks ?
FOLEY: I do n't know .
MAURICE: Stick and jab , stick and jab !
GLENN: I got to go take a piss .
KAREN: Glenn , are you trying to steal this car ?
GLENN: Jesus , I do n't believe it .
KAREN: Another one of those days , huh , nothing seems to go right ? He raises his empty hands .
GLEN: I do n't have the keys .
KAREN: I see that .
GLENN: I mean I 'm not stealing the fucking car .
KAREN: You 're not ?
GLENN: I already stole it . Last week o whenever it was , in West Palm . I ca n't e stealing it again , can I ?
KAREN: The two guys you were with that one , that is n't Maurice Miller , is it ? I 've seen Snoopy 's mug shot and that did n't look like him .
GLENN: Jesus . How 'd you know about Snoopy ? Karen looks at him , shakes her head .
KAREN: Glenn , I know your life history , who your friends are , where you 've been and now , it looks like , where you 're going . Put your hands on the wheel .
GLENN: You 're gon na bust me for picking up a car ?
KAREN: For the car , for aiding and abetting a prison escape , and conspiring to do whatever you came here for .
GLENN: Listen , these guys , they 're gon na be out here any minute looking for me . They 're fucking animals .
KAREN: What 's going on , Glenn ?
GLENN: Nothing . I just wan na get the fuck outta here .
KAREN: But I thought the whole thing was you idea ?
GLENN: Rippin ' off Ripley was my idea , but these guys , man , they 're into shit I ca n't handle .
KAREN: Ripley ? You mean the wall street guy ?
GLENN: Yeah , the plan was to pick him up at his office tomorrow , take him out to his house in Bloomfield Hills . Now , I do n't give a shit what they do .
KAREN: And is Foley a part of this ?
GLENN: He 's supposed to be , but he has n't shown up yet , which is a good thing for him .
KAREN: Why 's that ?
GLENN: Maurice is gon na kill him , try and collect the reward .
KAREN: But you say he has n't shown up , you think he backed out ?
GLENN: I do n't know he does n't exactly confide in me .
KAREN: Gee , I wonder why not .
GLENN: I 'm freezing my ass off .
KAREN: You want to get out of here , run , it 'll warm you up .
GLENN: Really ?
KAREN: But listen , Glenn . If you 're lying to me
GLENN: I know , you 'll find me . Jesus , I elieve it . I keep thinking if you had n't driven me to federal court last summer , you would n't even know who I am .
KAREN: If I did n't know you , Glenn , by tomorrow you 'd be in jail or dead . Look at it that way . Go on .
MAURICE: Where you been ? You miss the big boys , come in time for the walkout fights . Well , shit , you may as well pull up a chair . Foley and Buddy remain standing .
FOLEY: Who 's sitting here ?
MAURICE: Your homie , Glenn . Only thing , he went to the men 's about a while ago and never came back .
FOLEY: Well , if he left his coat and he 's een gone a while .
MAURICE: Reggie , push off and hit , man . Push him off .
FOLEY: We 're leaving .
MAURICE: The fuck you talking about ?
FOLEY: Snoop , if you do n't know where Glenn is
MAURICE: Look , what you worried about Glenn for ? What 's he know ?
FOLEY: I thought everything .
MAURICE: Glenn knows everything we suppose to
FOLEY: Give me a minute , talk to Buddy .
MAURICE: You got two minutes , that 's all . Make up your mind .
FOLEY: I was n't asking permission . Foley walks up to the bar with Buddy .
BUDDY: Whatta you wan na do ?
FOLEY: I get that feeling , yeah .
BUDDY: But you still think you can get the diamonds fore they do ? Foley looks at him a moment , then
FOLEY: I 'll make you a deal . Get out of here . Right now . I 'll do the job with the Snoop , meet you wherever you want and give you half .
BUDDY: Half for doing what ?
FOLEY: Getting me out of Glades for starters .
BUDDY: And who watches your back ?
MAURICE: Man has all that reward on his head and still talks like a con in the yard . You know what I 'm saying ? Like he 's a man you do n't mess with . Yeah , well ,
FOLEY: That what they 're wearing these days to break and enter ?
MAURICE: Break and enter , shit . Take it and git , how it 's done . Do n't waste any time . That 's how you do it .
FOLEY: So you 've done this before , huh ?
MAURICE: Shit , yeah . White Boy even got busted for it . White Boy , tell these boys the reason you went down on that burglary that time .
FOLEY: That 's a wonderful story , Snoop . I 'm very excited about tonight .
MAURICE: Hey . You learn from doing .
FOLEY: I 've seen 'em used on TV .
BUDDY: Slow down .
MAURICE: Do like he says , man . Slow down .
KAREN: Shit
MAURICE: `` An army .45 will stop all jive . '' Huey P. said that .
BUDDY: You think he was talking about walking into people 's houses when he said it ?
MAURICE: Get ready to go skiing . Now the front door opens
FOLEY: Go on in the house before you get hurt .
BUDDY: I 'm not leaving you alone with these assholes .
WOMAN: I work here . I 'm the maid .
KENNETH: Hey , shit , we 're gon na have a party .
MAURICE: Not yet . Where 's Mr. Ripley ?
MAID: I told you , he is n't here .
MAURICE: Out for the evening ?
MAID: He 's in Florida . Palm Beach .
MAURICE: When 's he due back ?
FOLEY: Jesus Christ , what difference does it make ? You want to wait for him ?
MAID: Mr. Ripley 's down for the season . Christmas to Easter .
MAURICE: You here all by yourself ?
MAID: That 's right , just me .
MAURICE: Where 's Ripley 's safe at , he keep his valuables in .

FOLEY: Maurice Miller , couple of his friends .
RIPLEY: Maurice ? From Lompoc ? Good God . Ripley moves to the doorway .

FOLEY: And how long was it before they caught up with you ?
HEJIRA: That time ?
FOLEY: There were others .
HEJIRA: Yeah . That was the ninth .
