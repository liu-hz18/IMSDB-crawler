SERB 2: Fifteen minutes to delivery .
PILOT: All clear from above .
SERBIAN 2: What happened ?
SERBIAN 1: We 've been hit . We 're taking on water .
SHANE: Lieutenant Shane Wolfe , United States Navy . I 'm gon na get you outta here . But you have to do exactly what I say , when I say it . My way no highway option . Do you copy ? Where 's the briefcase ?
PLUMMER: How did you know where I
SEAL: KEEP SHOOTING !
SHANE: I 've got the Prof and the case . First ound 's on me back at Virginia Beach .
PLUMMER: Oh my God . I ca n't believe you how 'd we That was the most incredible
SHANE: Better keep that on ` til we get to the endezvous point .
PLUMMER: Why ? Poison gas ?
SHANE: No . I 'm just not big on chit chat .
CHARLES: Lieutenant , thank you . You saved more than just my life today . Can I call my wife to let her know I 'm okay ?
SHANE: Negative . Not imperative to the mission . We have to keep moving . I have strict orders to get you out of here safely .
CHARLES: I 'm safe , Lieutenant . Please . She thinks I 'm dead . Do n't you have a family ?

SHANE: Captain , sir .
BILL: As you were Lieutenant .
SHANE: I know sir . And I except full esponsibility for the mission 's failure .
BILL: Why the hell did you let him use the satellite phone ?
SHANE: He had to call his family . A lapse in judgement on my part that I regret sir .
BILL: Plummer was the best security expert the department of defense ever had a genius . He was working on a program that scrambles launch codes . He called it G.H.O.S.T . Guided High-altitude Scrambling Transmitter . One pulse from the GHOST satellite and a country ca n't launch its own nukes . That 's what the Serbians kidnapped him for , but they could n't get S inside the briefcase .
SHANE: The case was empty sir , as I stated in my eport .
BILL: Not a surprise , really . Not like the professor to hide things where someone might look for them . G.H.O.S.T . is still out there , which is why I 'm going to give you another shot .
SHANE: Sir . Thank you . I appreciate you confidence .
BILL: Negative . It 's not that kind of mission .
BILL CONT'D: She 's scared . The family 's scared . Whoever killed the professor must think G.H.O.S.T . is in that house . Maybe it is , maybe it is n't . Either way , I need someone to stay at that house , and protect them . And while you 're there find out if the program is in there .
SHANE: That 's it ? Why would you want me fo that , sir .
BILL: The professor 's wife requested you .
SHANE: Sirnosir . It 's just that I 've neve een very good with kids , sir . Not even when I was a kid sir .

SHANE: Mrs. Plummer , I have to tell you that I did everything I could
JULIE: Charles was in a dangerous business . I knew it when I married him . No one 's to lame here . Everyone thinks that Charles told me o the kids where he hid it . And until G.H.O.S.T . is found , we 're all in danger .

SHANE: Come on . Julie Andrews was hot .
TODD: What if girls 'll think I 'm weird o something ?

F.B.I. AGENT: The Bureau is always looking for good men . Do you have a card or something ?

FBI AGENT: Yes .
LULU: Does it itch ?
FBI AGENT: Yes
ZOE: If you 're reading this , then Julie found the key . Julie , Tyler , Peter , Zoe , Todd , Lulu I want to say I love you more than anything . I always have .
PRINCIPAL CLAIRE: So . What happens now ? You 'll be stationed somewhere else , right ? I guess there 's no more reason for you to stick around here .
SHANE: Well . I 'm kinda , re-conning the situation , here And to tell the truth . I do n't see anything but reasons to stay .
RINCIPAL CLAIRE: So What 's the next move ?

SHANE CONT'D: Now let 's break a leg .
BEAT: Only a few who would be right .
BOWER: Burns are red ! Bruises blue-
BOWER: Bower .
BOWER: Faa-uck !
PAYTON: Who are you ?
BOWER: Bower . Corporal Bower , sir . I 'm the-
NOT FAMILIAR: Bower ?
BOWER: That 's right . You 're waking from
PAYTON: Corporal ?
BOWER: Yes , sir . This is disorientation from-
PAYTON: corporal Bower .
BOWER: Yes . That 's right , I'm-
PAYTON: Wan na get that fucking light out of my eyes , pal ?
BOWER: Sorry sir . PAYTON rubs his face with a frown .
PAYTON: Where are we ?
BOWER: We 're aboard the Elysium . From what I 've
NOT FAMILIAR: Elysium ? Where are we ?
BOWER: I do n't really know . There 's no powe in the com and I ca n't even-
PAYTON: Where 's the rest of the crew ? It 's our shift ? Our rotation-
BOWER: I believe so .
PAYTON: Are n't they suppose to be here to wake us ?
BOWER: Sir I do n't know where anyone is .
PAYTON: Hit the lights , will ya ?
BOWER: Ah we 're having some power problems-
PAYTON: Who woke you up ?
BOWER: Umm , not sure . It had to have been the flight computer . There 's no one here .except us .
PAYTON: Cold in here .
BOWER: There 's no power coming off the main grid . Ca n't fire any of the Dynos . Ca n't even open the doors .
PAYTON: Bower .
BOWER: Yeah ?
PAYTON: Until I have two coffees you 're just gon na have to repeat all this shit , so let 's just idle here for a bit .
BOWER: Sorry . I just- Just glad to see you awake . i was a little concerned . I did n't know what to do if-
PAYTON: Coffee ?
BOWER: I 'm on it .
PAYTON: Good man .
BOWER: This is you , sir .
PAYTON: How do you know that ?
BOWER: 1 It 's the name on your sleep pod , sir .
PAYTON: Very reassuring . I guess when you gamma the brain into extended REM , sometimes it can take a while to get it back .
BOWER: I 've been awake for at least an hour and I still ca n't remember my anything .
PAYTON: Listen , the last time I crawled out of a hyper bunk , it took me quite a while to get it all back .
BOWER: What was your last flight , sir ?
BEAT: Do n't recall . The Kuiper Belt odyssey ? Do n't worry , it 'll come back , eventually . PAYTON kisses the photo of his wife .
BOWER: Sir ? I know this is going to sound strange , but do you even know where we 're going ? I can remember the training , ut not the mission . Know the procedures , not the destination .
PAYTON: I figured you 'd tell me .
BOWER: Did n't even know the ship 's name until I saw it-on the console . For all I know this was another damn training exercise-
PAYTON: Trust me , it 's not . if this is a simulation
BOWER: None of the activators are working .
PAYTON: Figures . We can ride two hundred thousand tons of space freighter across the galaxy without a dent in the hood , ut ca n't get one good cup of coffee .
BOWER: Without the mainframe , we ca n't connect . I do n't know how we 'll ever be able to-
PAYTON: Payton on the con . Respond ? This is Lt. Payton of flight Team ? Shit-
BOWER: Five .
PAYTON: Five ? How do you know that ?
BOWER: Team Four suppose to be here for the shift rotation . Where could they be ?
PAYTON: Fucking teamsters . Maybe they could n't get to us . BOWER eyes the third empty sleep-chamber .
BOWER: Where could he have gone ?
PAYTON: The power systems must be free-floating off blown circuits or something . The over-ride grid wo n't even lock in .
BOWER: Whatta ya think ?
PAYTON: I think we need to find a deck of cards and call the union .
BOWER: Somebody is up there .
PAYTON: Hmm . Ventilation maybe . Systems keep e-booting after each surge . That could e anything .
BOWER: Jesus . Somebody was trying to get out .
PAYTON: Ironic . I think it was built to protect us .
BOWER: Well , he got out some how .
PAYTON: What ?
BOWER: It 's not circuitry . Reactor timing is off-set in the core . Seems sporadic , but it 's not . Each revolution decreasing efore starting over from the beginning .
PAYTON: How the hell do you know that ?
BOWER: I dunno . I ca n't remember my own- but I know everything there is to know about that damn reactor .
PAYTON: The training stuck .
BOWER: And I know that Another SHUDDER approaches .
PAYTON: Now if we only had a monkey and a rope .
BOWER: Our 2nd Lieutenant must have gone this way . Do n't you think ?
PAYTON: Must have .
BOWER: It 's the only way out .
PAYTON: I think we 're better off waiting here-
BOWER: For what ? If the mainframe is off-line-
PAYTON: We 're not going to be able to get to the idge or even be able to open that doo from the other side-
BOWER: But we can at least find out what 's
PAYTON: Do you remember just how big this ship is , kid ? We do n't know where that will come out , if at all-
BOWER: But , we can at least try to-
SOBERLY: I ca n't do that .
BOWER: Ca n't do Sir ?
PAYTON: Listen , I have to take a handful of Doxitol just to get in the hyper-bunk .
BOWER: You 're claustrophobic ?
PAYTON: I can take a lot , that 's not one of 'em .
BOLDLY: I can take it .
SIGH: Real boy scout , is that it ? You get lost in there and you 're a footnote in the
BOWER: You can guide me over two-way . PAYTON eyes him over with reluctance .
PAYTON: Just in case .there 's mail you need to open quickly .
BOWER: Yeah I think so .
PAYTON: Must be newlyweds . How can you forget something like that ?
BOWER: What do-you remember ? Anything yet ?
PAYTON: Some pieces .
EYES NARROWING: Still a little fuzzy but you 're the cocky little shit who wanted the window seat ?
BOWER: And you 're the cranky old bastard who made me take the aisle .
PAYTON: Give it some more time , pal .
GASPING: Dammit . PAYTON 'S voice crackles over the radio .
BOWER: Nothing yet . Christ , not a single vent opening or- Nothing . How about on you end ?
PAYTON: Power surges keep coming across in longe increments , just like you said .
BOWER: Hey ?
GASPING: Payton ? Nothing but STATIC .
BOWER: I dunno . I dunno if I can- I ca n't tell if I 'm going in circles or- There 's nothing to- Ca n't breath-
PAYTON: Easy , pal . Breath easy . Listen to me-
BOWER: I just want to stand up for God 's sakes ! Ca n't breath-
PAYTON: Bower ? BOWER ! ? Stop it . Stop it ! Just listen to me . Put it out of you head . Stop moving and breath . Listen to
BOWER: WHAT ! ? Are you fucking kidding me ! ?
BOWER: Dream like that , sounds like you 've got some guilt issues .
HAUNTING REALIZATION: .eight years .
BOWER: Why would I-leave her ? I ca n't even emember saying good-bye . Why would I ?
PAYTON: Well , you are n't here on default . This was a select pick . This flight was different .
PAYTON: We 're not just doing speed laps on the elt . This was something special .
BOWER: Someone 's been
PAYTON: What 's wrong ?
BOWER: I 'm I 'm at an angle ! Shit !
BOWER: Aaaaeirrrgh !
PAYTON: Bower ! ? What happened ? Bower ! ?
PAYTON: Bower ! ? Through the static comes a HOWL of victory .
BOWER: I 'm out ! I'm- PAYTON breathes a heavy sigh of relief .
PAYTON: Jesus , do n't scare me like that ! Where are you ?
BOWER: I'm- I 'm inside a boot locker !
PAYTON: Bower ? You alright ? BOWER ! ?
BOWER: Make that an overhead compartment . You with me , Payton ? I got out . Hear me ?
PAYTON: Bower ? Do you hear me ? Bower ? Nothing but STATIC .
PANICKED: Payton ? Are you there ? Answer me .
PAYTON: Bower ? You there ?
CLICK: Com'on , man . You there ?
NADIA: Keine Bewegung !
BOWER: What- ! ?
GERMAN ACCENT: Do n't move !
DAZED: Wait a second-
NADIA: Do n't you move MOTHER FUCKER !
BOWER: Wait- I 'm part of the crew ! I'm-
BOWER: I wo n't ! Please ! Just listen- I 'm not-
NADIA: Take them off !
BOWER: What ! ?
NADIA: SHOES ! I 'll gut your ass-
BOWER: Alright , alright ! Take it easy !
BOWER: But , why would she try to kill me ! ? She was going to slit my throat ! And why would they look like that ?
BOWER: They sure-as-shit were n't a welcoming party from the Promenade deck ! These guys were looking to do some damage .
PAYTON: If they 're in there why have n't they thrown the security hammer into lock down ? Seal and freeze it until the emergency units wake ?
BOWER: Maybe they ca n't . With the systems kicking on and off- Maybe they 're flying lind , with no control of the LFS ?
PAYTON: Either way we ca n't assume help will be coming . On-board or off . Out here , there is no rescue . There is no turning around . This thing was n't even built .to return .
BOWER: What are you talking about ?
PAYTON: This is no regular transport . We 're not out collecting data off the belt o hauling cargo we are the cargo . It was a single launch trajectory for
BOWER: .Tanis . Planetary processing and population . We 're a settler 's vessel .
HAUNTING REALIZATION: Elysium . This was a one-way ticket . BOWER 'S gaze goes distant as
PAYTON: What ?
BOWER: We did n't leave them behind . No one did . They 're on this flight ! Remember the ecruitment .
BOWER: I 've got to find her before those fucking animals do ! I 've got to-
PAYTON: Hold it , hold it ! Think about this for a
BOWER: What 's there to think about ! ? I emember ! There was thousands of passengers that were n't part of the development team . Families that-
PAYTON: No , listen to me ! LISTEN ! You know how ig this ship is and there 's no way of knowing exactly where- If you go on some wild goose chase to try to find her-
PAYTON: And then we would be no closer to getting out of this situation with even less time to regain control of the ship .
BOWER: But how do we- I r PAYTON Where are you ?
BOWER: I dunno . Officer 's quarters , somewhere above D-level , I think- I don't-
PAYTON: I can guide you . Find out where you are . Hatch marker . Over the door .
PAYTON: Take it .
PAYTON: Back toward the flight decks . Back to me .
BOWER: Listen if you can get me to the eactor bay . I can reset the eactor 's cycle .
GASPING: Third crossing . Marker D-5381-X .
PAYTON: Okay . Hold up . I do n't want you to go too far down that lane . Just catch you
GASPING: I do n't need a rest . Which way ?
PAYTON: I do n't know vet . Hold on-
BOWER: Eden .
PAYTON: What did you say ?
PAYTON: Of all things to remember , why would you pick that ?
BOWER: I 'm just thinking , maybe there 's something we have n't considered . Eden failed because of ODS syndrome . The one officer who was suffering from Pandorum . Cabin Fever . Maybe there was something similar with one of the earlie
PAYTON: No , no , no . You 're talking about- Eden was lost because of a mechanical failure ,
BOWER: That was the report but do n't you emember the story of the one flight officer the real story ? They say he went lunar , launched the entire ship , five thousand people killed with the flip of a switch . All from a bad case of cabin fever- ?
PAYTON: spook story , along with a million others . Eden was mechanical failure , not human error . A. glitch that was remedied way efore we ever-
BOWER: And why did they switch the rotation shifts from three years to two ? And they eliminated the manual over-ride-
PAYTON: They did that for obvious reasons , not ecause of Eden .
BOWER: Well , at least we did n't wake up floating away in a coffin .
PAYTON: Who says we did n't ?
BOWER: Something happened to the other team ? Maybe there was Pandorum .
PAYT ON: What 's wrong ?
BOWER: Have I done a circle or am I doubling ack ?
BOWER: Stop it ! Jesus , I 'm not gon na - SHUT-UP !
ANGERED WHISPER: I 'm not gon na hurt ya ! Just shut the hell up ! I 'm gon na get you out of this thing . But , you have to be quiet , understand ?
BOWER: He 's team six . The unit that 's suppose to follow us . He's-
SHEPARD: Shepard , Thomas L. Team Six . Secto Eight . I think I 'm the only one , sir . I knew it . I knew you 'd be coming .
BOWER: Huh ?
SHEPARD: Where 's the rest of your squad ?
BOWER: Squad ? My Lieutenant and I were the-
SHEPARD: Where 's the shuttle ?
BOWER: Shuttle ? What are you talking about ? SHEPARD 'S expression drops .
SHEPARD: Are n't you the retraction team ? The
BOWER: No , no . Hold on . I 'm from this crew . I 'm from Team Five .
SHEPARD: You just woke up ?
BOWER: six maybe eight hours ago . I had to crawl all the way from the upper deck
SHEPARD: So you do n't have a fucking clue to what 's happened ? Is that it ?
BOWER: That 's what we 're trying to figure out ! Tell me- what happened ! ?
I SHEPARD: You know as much as I do .
BOWER: I do n't know anything .
SHEPARD: You 'll fit right in .
BOWER: What are you doing ?
SHEPARD: Get the scent off .
BOWER: What ! ?
SHEPARD: I ca n't help you . I 'm sorry .
BOWER: Help.me ? Wait a second-
SHEPARD: They go off scent and sound as far as I can tell and they 're a lot fucking stronger and faster they you 'd think .
BOWER: They- Who the hell are they ! ?
SHEPARD: I ca n't wait for you .
BOWER: God dammit , WAIT ! You 're still an officer of this ship and at present time , your CO is ordering you to-
SCOFF: ordering ? For your information , there 's a new CO on board . So fuck you and you
TERRIFIED WHISPER: That 's not going to help you .
PUSH IN: Fear over comes BOWER .
BOWER: Payton ?
MOUTHING: Do n't follow me ! I ca n't help you-
PAYTON: Bower ! ? BOWER ! ? Answer me God Dammit !
BOWER: They got him ! They fucking ripped him apart ! They're-
GASPING: They 're everywhere ! They're-

NADIA: Gee , you think ? Where are you going ?
BOWER: I 'm heading for the reactor bay .
NADIA: You just wake up ?

BOLTER: You know where you 're going ? This does n't `` feel '' right .
NO RESPONSE: How long have you been awake ?
NADIA: Do n't know . There 's no way to tell time in here . Two maybe three months .
NADIA: Quiet ! You wan na get us killed ! ?
WHISPER: How could you have- You telling me people have been running around on board for several months ! ?
NADIA: Longer . I was n't the first one up .

NADIA: i Shush ! We 're waiting .
BOWER: Waiting for what- ?
NADIA: Quiet !
NADIA: Ssssht !
BOWER: Who are they ? What the hell are those things ?
NADIA: Never quite felt like sticking around to find out . Running is always the best option . Believe me .
BOWER: They 're not- They ca n't be from this ship . They do n't seem human . Do you think something got on board or maybe I something He turns to follow her and pauses to see
NADIA: Ecological Development , Embryonic Charter . Livestock and wildlife re- population .
BOWER: You 've been living in here ? You 're protecting it ?
NADIR: It ' seems to be the only living thing left on this ship worth protecting . Regardless of the situation , we still have a mission . We 've only lost about thirty percent of the specimens , mostly eptilian class . Never was big into snakes anyway .
BOWER: Tanis .
NADIA: You could n't remember ?
BOWER: No , I- I did n't remember just how fa away it is until now . This was a hundred and twenty-three year flight .
NADIA: It comes only in pieces . Even after a few months . I know everything about this vault and its systems but I still ca n't remember where I grew up . Or my other 's name . Only pieces And the training comes back first . For good eason , I guess .
BOWER: How could we have become like this in only eight years ?
NADIA: Dehydrated meatloaf . House special . I save 'em for the weekends .
BOWER: How long ?
NADIA: I do n't know , but it takes more then a couple years to turn coal into fucking diamonds .
BOWER: You think we 've over slept ?
NADIA: This ship was built to outlast ou children 's children and any enginee could tell ya the warranty is running out . I think we 've been asleep longe then you may think .
BOWER: Do you have a radio ?
NADIA: Who the hell is there to call ?
BOWER: I 'm not the only flight crew office awake . We 're not in this alone .
PAYTON: You want in ? Come and get it you fu-
GALLO: Help me- I 'm part- of the flight crew ! I'm- Please- HELP ME !
PAYTON: Easy Easy . You 're all right .
PAYTON: EASY ! I 'm here to help you !
MUMBLING: Gallo .
PAYTON: What 's that ? Gallo ?
TREMBLING: Yes , sir .
PAYTON: Where did you come from , Gallo ?
GALLO: The bridge .
PAYTON: The bridge ! ? Where are we ? What 's happened ? Can you tell me-
NADIA: We ca n't get through this way .
BOWER: I 'd prefer to stay on foot .
NADIA: It 's the safest way to travel . And there 's only one other way to get through that I know of .
BOWER: And what is that ?
NADIA: Main corridor . Hyper-sleep chamber , Personnel . Keep your light down .
BOWER: Jesus
NADIA: Keep quiet .
BOWER: Wait a second . My wife-
NADIA: Keep moving .
BOWER: No , wait . My wife could be in here .
NADIA: What does she do ? What 's her specialty ?
BOWER: She 's not part of the crew , but spouses were brought with . I remember there were-
NADIA: Then she 's not in here . This is development settlers . Engineers .
BOWER: Do you know where the family members are-
GROWL: Quiet !
BOWER: I do n't see what he 's looking at , do you ?
NADIA: We have to keep moving . We do n't want to stay out in the open for too long . Especially in here .
TO TANAKA: Hey ? Let 's go !
NADIA: We ca n't stay herel
BOWER: Let 's get out of here ! Com'on-
NADIA: Then you wait and find your own way .
BOWER: We ca n't split up the team , it 's all
NADIA: I told you I 'm not going to wait . I 'm not gon na get myself killed for-
BOWER: The guy saved my life twice already . I 'm not gon na leave him-
NADIA: What do you think he 's doing in there ! ?
BOWER: How the hell should I know-
NADIA: He 's hunting ! Bagging the next notch on his belt . You wait for him ! Good luck .
BOWER: Wait ! I 'm coming-
HORRIFIED: My God ! Wait- Where are we going ! ?
WHISPER: Do n't move .
WHISPER: Where did it go- ?
GASPING: Jesus Christ- Jesus-
BOWER: What is he doing ?
NADIA: Run .
BOWER: They 're everywhere-
NADIA: Run !
BOWER: What the hell happened to them ! ? What the hell are those things ! ?
NADIA: Shut-up !
TANAKA: Japanese - No subtitles .
BOWER: I second that . Let 's get the fuck out of here . Which way did we come from ?
NADIA: You want to go back ?
BOWER: No , I mean let 's just go !
NADIA: We should go back . Find a different path . I do n't think we can get through to the reactor bay from-
BOWER: You said there was no other path .
NADIA: I 'm ready to explore other options-
BOWER: Which way did they go- ?
NADIA: You really want to discuss it here ! ?
NADIA: What are you doing- ! ?
BOWER: They 'll hear him- They'll- We 've got to
GALLO: What are you doing ?
PAYTON: Just checking you .
GALLO: For what ?
PAYTON: To make sure you 're alright . You passed out . You-
GALLO: Who the hell are you ?
PAYTON: Payton Lieutenant Payton .
GALLO: Lieutenant ? You 're a lieutenant ?
PAYTON: That 's right . You 're Team Four ? You 're suppose to be my predecessor .
LEERY: Yeah . So ?
PAYTON: Where are we ? I ca n't get guidance off this system and I have no idea where-
GALLO: I do n't know .
PAYTON: Well , what did you see ? How did
GALLO: Listen , I 'm not a navigator . Stars all look alike . I do n't know ! How the hell would I know ! ?
PAYTON: Easy . I just want to make sure GALLO 'S hands are trembling , uncontrollably .
GALLO: I 'm fine .
PAYTON: Is this your blood Corporal ?
GALLO: Some of it is sir .
PAYTON: Whose blood is it ? GALLOholds his stare , jaw muscles tightening .
GALLO: They did n't give me any choice .
PAYTON: Who did n't ?
GALLO: There was something wrong with them .
PAYTON: i Something was wrong with who ?
GALLO: It was Pandorum . Of the worst sort . They were- I could n't even- I had to defend myself .
PAYTON: Pandorum . Both of them- ?
GALLO: You do n't believe me ?
UNCONVINCED: I believe you .
GALLO: What are you doing ? What is that ?
PAYTON: It 's just a sedative . Help you relax-
GALLO: Then you take it and relax . PAYTON backs off , setting the syringe aside .
PAYTON: Take it easy . We 're on the same team here . Alright ?
FLATLY: Sure , Lieutenant .
BOWER: Did n't we come through here already ?
NADIA: We got ta find a way out .
BOWER: Out ? Why did we come iii- ?
NADIA: I was trying to get us out of there alive-
BOWER: I thought you knew where you were going .
NADIA: I was trying to save our asses-
BOWER: Could 've mentioned that after the first mile . If I would have known we 'd be doing laps down here-
NADIA: I did n't need to help you at all ! You and the Hong-Kong Express would still be playing ding-dong-ditch on level eight if it were n't for me !
TANAKA: HIIISSST !
BOWER: What the hell is that ?
LELAND: No , no , no . Back in der ' big boy !
BOWER: Get back ! BACK !
LELAND: Whoa WHOA ! What the hell was that ! ?
BOWER: Shut off the gas !
LELAND: Where did you get that ?
LELAND: Fancy looking piece . Looking to trade ?
BOWER: You live here ?
LELAND: Sublet . Got a roomier flat in the bow for the off season , but from here , ya just ca n't beat the commute .
BOWER: Left ? Have you seen any ?
LELAND: Well , only the captain . informally , mind you .
BOWER: Captain ? Where ! ?
LELAND: Umm , up on B-Deck . Some on C. A few pieces on the promenade and I think his nuts are in the foose-ball game in the ec room .
BOWER: Why do n't you come on down so we can meet properly ?
LELAND: Oh , no-no . No-can-do . I 'm real touchy to the dust bug and who knows where yawl have been . No offense . There 's something funky going around . But do n't let that spoil the party . Here
BOWER: Where do you think we are ?
NADIA: I do n't know . Got ta be somewhere below B- deck .
LELAND: Why , where you got ta be ?
BOWER: The reactor bay . Know where it is ?
LELAND: Reactor ? Now why would you want to go down there ?
GRIN: You just woke up , did n't cha ?
LELAND: It 's tough to properly season with a motor oil base . But if you use you imagination , kinda tastes like
SIP: Herb and garlic dog shit .
BOWER: How long have you been awake ?
LELAND: Mmmm . Lem me think . What 's today , Tuesday ? That would be about , mmm
SOBERLY: Not naming names but I 'm writing a very strongly worded letter to the airline .
BOWER: Those things out there . Could it have een something that crawled out of your lab ? Something that-
NADIA: No . That 's not possible .
BOWER: Then something got on board . Some kind of life form . Something that-
NADIA: Or something that was already on board , with us in the hyper-bunks .
BOWER: What does that mean ?
NADIR: it could have been the accelerator .
BOWER: What ?
NADIA: It 's the only theory I can come up with . The synthetic enzyme in our feeding tubes . The accelerator that would help our bodies adjust and adapt to the environmental conditions on Tanis . From what I 've seen these things have adapted to the ship instead .
BOWER: But , why would- You 're saying we 'll ecome like them ? Why would they be affected like that and we 're not-
NADIA: I do n't know . Like I said , it 's the only theory I can think of- Unless
GALLO: Do you know the symptoms of Pandorum ?
PAYTON: What ?
GALLO: Orbital Dysfunctional Syndrome . Pandorum . Ever witnessed the symptoms of first-hand ?
PAYTON: I 've seen it before . But nothing that-
GALLO: It 's not something you can easily detect . Starts with a shiver . An itch . A slow oil and without being able to get off the ship there 's no shutting off the heat . It 'll boil over , no matter what you do .
PAYTON: I did n't say that-
GALLO: How could they both have had it ? The odds are insurmountable .
PAYTON: I was n't about to question any of you
GALLO: But , we all know Pandorum is greatly affected by any substantial psychological It has an emotional trigger effect .
PAYTON: That 's what they say .
GALLO: How do you think you would react if you knew the truth ?
PAYTON: The truth about what ?
LELAND: B0000OM ! Oh , how the world cheered to the thunder of it 's mightiest creation . Eylisium ! The heaven for heroes , to venture further and farther then any of man 's machine dared before it .
GALLO: we were only into our second term . All flight systems nominal . I 'd picked up on symptoms with my CO and 2nd Lieutenant . Mild symptoms . Nothing I thought would become a problem . Until we got the transmission .
PAYTON: What transmission ?
GALLO: The final transmission . The last message from home .
I LELAND: .until the last cry from home . All of God 's creation ending with mere words of encouragement . Mother Earth 's last call . Boop ! Leave a message , momma .
RECORDER VOICE: Hoove arr awl dadz efft ah uz . Bood uck , oogz guezz ab hoobz deeb .
BOWER: What is that saying ?
RECORDER VOICE: Yoove are all watt efft of uz . Good uck , gog besh ab Gogz deez . You are all whadz left of uz . Gog besh and Gogs sbeeb God blezz and Gogz speeb
GALLO: You are that 's left of us . Good luck , God bless and God 's speed .
PAYTON: Earth is gone ?
GALLO: Wiped away . We ran a full sweep off the grid and they were gone . One day there , the next nothing .
PAYTON: In one day it had to be nuclear or- ?
GALLO: Whatever it was , they knew it was coming . Wished us well . We 're all that 's left .
PAYTON: Oh my God
GALLO: You can see why I was hesitant to tell even you . My fellow crew members did n't take the news too well . I wanted to wake the primary crew but my 2nd Lt was already over the edge .
LELAND: Three little Indians , with the burden to are no more law and nothing left to care . Three poor souls , destiny undone . Chop , chop , chop now there 's only one .
GALLO: They were my commanding officers . Men who had guided me through FT . I looked up to these men . But it was n't them anymore . They were gone . They tried to I had no choice . I-
PAYTON: Easy
LELAND: One little Indian left all alone with his doom .
SOBER FROWN: you want me to back up ?
BOWER: Play that transmission again . I want-
LELAND: Save yer questions til the end please . We 'll have a review .
NADIA: Could that be real ? You think that could-
BOWER: I dunno . It ca n't be- It just-
LELAND: And now the newest chapter comes to us three weary travelers , guided by the light . The new brave flyer , woken by the dying machine .
PAYTON: How could they how could they have let this happen ?
BOWER: What are you doing ! ? What the-
NADIA: He was- He was gon na fucking eat me !
LELAND: Whaw ! ? I waddn't-
NADIA: He gassed us ! He was gon na - All of us !
LELAND: Gas ! What gas ! ?
NADIA: What is that ?
BOWER: It 's gone into the final cycle .
NADIA: What does that mean ?
BOWER: it means we have less time then I thought . The last phase before shutdown . It means we 're done .
NADIA: Done ! ? What do you mean done ? What do we do ? Hey ! ?
BOWER: What difference does it make ?
NADIA: What are you talking about ? You said you could reset the reactor- That we could- That there 's a chance to-
BOWER: For what ? They 're gone . Everything is gone . There 's no Earth to go back to ,
NADIA: We were n't meant to go back ! We were meant to go on . And now it 's more important then ever ! We 're the last of-
BOWER: And what is left of us ? What 's left , worth saving ? This flight 's over .
NADIA: What about your duty ? What about you wife ! ? There 's still a chance she's-
BOWER: She 's dead .
NADIA: You do n't know that for sure !
BOWER: I know
BOWER: You got a radio ?
LELAND: Who the hell are you gon na call- ?
BEAT: You promise to bring it back ?
PAYTON: BOWER ! I 'm here ! Where are you ?
BOWER: Storage Tanks , just below B-level . Mid- ship Sector twelve we think .
I PAYTON: How the hell did you get all the way to Y the other side of-
PAYTON: I hear you . How do we get you in there ?
I BOWER: I need you to give me a path .
BOWER: What ?
LELAND: What did he say ?
BOWER: I dunno . But do what he says .
DEVASTATED: Oh my God
BOWER: Child ! ? That 's no child ! What the hell is it ! ?
LELAND: Not as cute when they 're little , are they ?
NADIA: My God . They 're breeding .
BOWER: What ! ? What do you mean they ? How could they- That 's impossible .
LELAND: Little bastard rang the bell .
NADIA: There 's no where to turn back to . We ca n't give up-
LELAND: Told you this would n't fly .
NADIA: You did n't tell us anything . You neve said that . You said you 'd love to come-
PONDERING: Oh then I forgot . This wo n't work .
BOWER: Why not ?
LELAND: This is where they live . Reactor is the Keeper 's temple .
GALLO: What are you doing ?
PAYTON: I think the direct channels are fried . I 'm gon na run a patch so we can get this door open as soon as we 're back on-line .
GALLO: What 's so important on the other side of the door ?
PAYTON: The bridge . As soon as we 're up we 'll be able to take control of guidance . But only from on the bridge .
GALLO: This ship is not dying .
PAYTON: He can do it .
GALLO: Twelve hours ago , he did n't know his own name . Now , you think he 's ready to re- configure a nuclear reactor ?
PAYTON: He 's the only shot we have . Got ta have a little faith .
GALLO: Faith ? After what you know now , you can actually say that with a straight face ? A little faith ?
NADIA: What are you doing ? What is it ?
DAZED: These were family members of flight personnel .
BOWER: She 's not here . She 's dead .
NADIA: How do you know for sure ? She could be-
BOWER: She 's not on this flight . She would n't come with me . She would n't marry me . That 's why I came . There was nothing left for me there . She stayed on Earth . Gone with everyone else . And I left ecause of her .
NADIA: Well , then she saved your life .
BOWER: Marianne .
NADIA: you knew her ?
BOWER: I remember her . Payton 's wife .
NADIA: Who 's Payton ?
BOWER: I remember her . I remember-
NADIR: Are you alright ?
BOWER: Com'on .
GALLO: He 's right about one thing . Once that thing shuts down , we 're as good as dead . Nothing on this ship will ever turn on again . Ever . Not the air , not the lights , the heat not even the pod 's escape launch systems . PAYTON refuses to look up from the computer .
3 PAYTON: What are you saying ?
GALLO: I'm�saying once it 's done . We 're done . But , we still have a way out of this before it 's too late .
PAYTON: What are you suggesting , Corporal ?
GALLO: We can still launch ourselves in the pods . Before the ignition systems are completely dead , sir .
PAYTON: Launching ourselves into deep space when we do n't even know where we are ? We would n't last more then a few days inside those things . That 's suicide-
GALLO: A few days is better then what we have left here . I 'll take my chances . How long do you think that reactor has been sitting ? That thing could melt-down when he tries to fire the core . This ship could be ripped in half-
PAYTON: Stand down , Corporal . We 're not going to abandon anything and we 're not going to leave them behind-
GALLO: We ca n't stay on this ship . You know that as well as I do-
PAYTON: I said stand down , Corporal ! That 's an order !
BOWER: This is our chance .
NADLA: Shut-up ! Move !
PAYTON: He 's in ! That 's the reactor 's activato panel . We 're going to make it out of
GALLO: Trust you ? How can I trust someone who is n't even honest with himself . Tell me ?
PAYTON: Gallo you have to listen to me Carefully . You do n't have•to-
GALLO: Do n't do that .
PAYTON: Do n't do what ?
GALLO: Do n't talk to me like some child that needs reassurance . Think I do n't know the risks ? Think I do n't know this ship ?
PAYTON: Take it easy-
GALLO: I know this ship and what she 's capable of better then anyone . I know her and I know what she can and ca n't do .
PAYTON: Easy
GALLO: And this she ca n't do ! Why are we even arguing . You know it-
PAYTON: I 'm giving you an order
GALLO: You wan na stay here to die , that 's you choice , not mine !
PAYTON: .to stand-down Corporal .
PAYTON: Think about what you 're doing
GALLO: I 'm getting off this ship . My flight 's over . OVER !
PAYTON: This wo n't work
GALLO: Shut-up .
PAYTON: just think about what you 're doing-
PAYTON: It was n't the crew that was sick , was it ?
GALLO: Finish the code
PAYTON: What did you really do to them ? GALLO slides into the pod and
PAYTON: For your own good-
PAYTON: You 're not well , Corporal . You just need the proper treatment-
PAYTON: This is n't your fault-
PAYTON: Your mind has turned against itself .
NADIA: Hurry ! Go !
BOWER: Com'on
NADIA: Bower ?
BOWER: I 'm going as fast as I can-
PAYTON: I My God he did it ! He did it .
GALLO: Let me out . I can help .
PAYTON: shut-up .
DEVILISH GRIN: They 'll know what you did .
GALLO: Where do you think you 're going ?
GALLO: Think about what you 're doing , sir-
GALLO: You do n't want to see what 's in there-
BOWER: Go GO ! GO !
NADIA: You snake bastard- OPEN IT !
GALLO: We both know who needs this shot
GALLO: Who 's the one suffering sir-
GALLO: Corporal
GALLO: Your mind has turned against itself ,
PAYTON: I 'll FUCKING CARVE YOU UP !
LELAND: We made it ! We- I 'm with your boy . I was the one helping with-
I PAYTON: Captain on the bridge .
BOWER: That 's it ! GO ! Go for it !
NADIA: Where 's your lieutenant ?
BOWER: He 's not my lieutenant .
IN AWE: What 's happened to us ? Where are we ?
BOWER: Flight log . It 'll tell us how long we 've I been out and how far we 've gone .
DRYLY: Mine too .
BOWER: Who the hell are you ?
GALLO: I was younger then you when I first came on board . Funny , I ca n't even remembe what it was like before this flight egan . It 's all I know .
BOWER: You were the one who first received the final transmission . Who refused to go back to sleep . You stayed awake for all those years . What were you doing what crimes were you hiding from when you took Payton 's bunk ?
IMPRESSED: How the hell would you know all that ?
BOWER: Is it true ? What have you done to us ? Where are we now ? GALLO lazily nods towards the windows .
GALLO: Go ahead . Take a peek . You tell me .
BOWER: And that makes it okay ? To play God ?
GALLO: You think God survived ? He 's gone with the rest . There 's no one left to judge you , Bower .
BOWER: Judgement will come for you . You think you could cover it ? Your victims survived . Evolved . That 's your creation out there . Your crime . BOWER jabs the gun into his back with force .
GALLO: No world left . No law . No order . Only us . You the law now ? You gon na be the one that brings order to what 's left ? Wan na take a shot at it ? I did my best with what I was given . Wan na be King fo a day ? Give it a whirl , Corporal . I 'd like to see how you fare .
BOWER: Shut-up .
TO NADIA: What 's out there ?
GALLO: Imagine us both . What 's left to stop you ? I offer you the kingdom and you-
GALLO: There 's still quite a few sleeping eauties down there a thousand flavors . You up for a little window shopping ?
BOWER: Shut-up !
GALLO: I wan na see it . I 'll bet you 'd be a
BOWER: There will be law in whatever world we create . And you 'll pay for what you 've done . Believe me .
GALLO: A real boy scout , is that it , kiddo ?
GALLO: You ready for the new world , corporal ?
DISBELIEF: We 've we 've already crashed . We 've already we 're
GALLO: I guess this thing does land itself . Just does n't float too well .
NADIA: NO ! ? Are you crazy-
GASPING: Not like this ! I can't- like this !
BOWER: Hold on !
NADIA: I What are you doing ! ?
BOWER: 1 Put it on !
NADIA: No ! I can't- Not like this ! I 'm not going to wake up and drowned-
GASPING: Where are we ? What happened ?
GRIN: It 's all right . It 's safe to wake up this time .
YOUNG GALLO: Well , if you 're gon na be captain what are we gon na do now ? Off his look
GALLO: What is a King without his Queen . He hits the control panel switch and
LYDIA: seventeen feet wide , fifty-five feet deep , forty-two hundred square feet , four floors with a rentable asement apartment , so five altogether , courtyard in back
MEG: Could you slow down a little ? Or we could wait for the car
LYDIA: No cars . Feet are faster .
MEG: How many more do we have after this ?
LYDIA: None , there 's nothing else , you know how tight the market is .
MEG: This is it ? I told you on the phone , I have to be moved in in two weeks . Sarah , please do n't bounce that here .
SARAH: Mom , it 's the sidewalk .
LYDIA: Oh , that miserable little prick is already leaving .
EVAN: One day you will learn to respect other people 's time , Lydia , one day you
LYDIA: Evan , I am so sorry , you were a saint to wait for us !
EVAN: This is the middle of the house , the entry floor , living room 's ove there . The kitchen floor 's below us and there 's two bedroom floors above .
LYDIA: No ball , kid .
EVAN: Working elevator . Mr. Pearlstine , the previous owner , was disabled the last ten years of his life . Highly unusual , the elevator , you will not find this in ninety percent of ownstones .
MEG: Will they take asking price ? I need a two week escrow and I 'm already approved for the loan .
EVAN: What say we see the house before we dicker , hmm ? I have to warn you , this is exactly the response we expected to get . It 's a very emotional property .
LYDIA: Who taught you to negotiate ?
SARAH: It 's not like Saks ' , Mom , you do n't have to pay the price on the tag .
MEG: I 'm sorry . Apartments , and money , and this is more my husband 's area .
EVAN: Top floor . Two bedrooms , one athroom .
LYDIA: He 's talking about Bernard Pearlstine .
EVAN: Master bath .
LYDIA: The hotel guy ? It 's been in the papers lately . His kids are all suing each other over his estate . He was a total recluse , paranoid , ich as hell , he was worth thirty million or something , now it turns out they ca n't find half of it . Somebody took something did n't elong to them !
EVAN: I hardly see how family gossip is germane to showing the property .
LYDIA: Stop calling it the property , you sound ridiculous .
EVAN: Master closet .
LYDIA: KID ! NO ELEVATOR !
EVAN: And we emerge in the master bedroom .
MEG: Something 's weird .
LYDIA: What ?
MEG: I do n't know , does n't that corne seem funny to you ?
EVAN: I was waiting to see if you 'd notice ! On caravan , no one from ou office had the slightest idea .
MEG: A what ?
EVAN: A safe room . An inner sanctum . A castle keep , in medieval times .
LYDIA: Oh , I 've seen these
EVAN: It 's quite in vogue in high end construction right now . One really ca n't be too careful about home invasion .
LYDIA: Hey , this is perfect for you Absolutely ! You 're a woman , you 're living alone now . Your alarm goes off , or you head glass break , or fo whatever reason you think someone 's oken into your home in the middle of the night . What are you going to do ? Call the police and wait until they get here on Tuesday ? Traipse downstairs in your sexy little underthings and check it out ? I think not !
EVAN: Reinforced steel core walls . Buried phone line , completely separate , not connected to the house 's main line and never exposed throughout the house 's infrastructure or outside the house you can call the police ; nobody can cut you off . Your own ventilation system , complete with oxygen scrubber , so you 've got plenty of fresh air fo as long as you like . And a bank of video monitors
MEG: Makes me nervous .
LYDIA: Why ?
MEG: Ever read any Poe ?
LYDIA: I do n't think so , but I love he album .
MEG: No , Edgar Allen .
LYDIA: The furniture guy ?
MEG: What 's to keep them from prying open the door ?
EVAN: Steel , four inches thick .
MEG: Open it .
LYDIA: Old Bernie did n't miss a trick with this room , did he ?
MEG: Open the door .
LYDIA: And with kids like he 's got , no wonder he wanted a place to hide .
EVAN: That 's highly inappropriate .
MEG: I said open the door .
SARAH: My room . Definitely my room .
LYDIA: That door is a safely hazard .
EVAN: Not at all .
MEG: Do n't !
SARAH: Too many stairs .
MEG: Got us in here , did n't I ?
SARAH: Shoulda got an apartment .
MEG: Well , I know that now .
SARAH: 478-0150 .
MEG: Battery 's dead .
SARAH: The crowd goes wild .
SARAH: 0150 .
VOICE: Perry 's Pizza , please hold .
SARAH: Fuck him .
MEG: Do n't .
SARAH: Fuck her too .
MEG: I agree . But do n't .
SARAH: `` Tom 's throat felt so dry and tight that it was a moment before he could make any sound come out . `` Dad ! '' He croaked . `` I 'm - inside - the - machine ! '' `` Great Scott ! '' The elde scientist gasped . He dashed across the laboratory and switched off the epelatron 's motor . `` What happened , son ? '' `` The Durafoam hardened , Dad . Get a solvent , quick you know the formula ! ''

JUNIOR: Fuck .
BURNHAM: I know .
RAOUL: What ?
BURNHAM: A woman and a little girl , both asleep upstairs .
JUNIOR: Fuck !
BURNHAM: Keep your voice down .
JUNIOR: They 're not supposed to be here !
BURNHAM: This was your department , Junior .
JUNIOR: They 're not supposed to be here !
BURNHAM: That 's why the key did n't work , they changed the locks .

BURNHAM: This is insane . I 'm outta here .

RAOUL: It 's just the woman and the kid ?
BURNHAM: Unless Daddy comes back later .
JUNIOR: Daddy 's not coming back , she 's in the middle of a divorce , it 's just the two of them . We 're okay , here . We can do this , right ?

BURNHAM: Who else but God could think this shit up ? I spend ten years building those fucking rooms to keep people out , now I got ta figure out how to get in . God , man , He just loves the irony .
JUNIOR: Yes . Yes , it 's all terrible ironic and amusing . You fuck . Now how are you gon na get us into that room ?
BURNHAM: Ca n't . Whole point . Ca n't get in the room .
RAOUL: So what the fuck are we supposed to do ? !
BURNHAM: Make her come out . And when she does , that 's when we got ta be careful . She ca n't get out of this house . She ca n't even think she can get out of this house . We just keep them here and keep them quiet fo forty-five minutes . And I do n't want Joe Pesci here standing over them with his fat sweaty finger on the trigger . That 's a sure way for us to end up with two dead bodies and little puffs of smoke burning out of our heads up in Greenhaven . So we 're gon na seal the place up . They wan na hole up in here ? Fine , we 'll help 'em . Make it impossible fo them to leave . Once they come out of that room .

HARRY: You 're resigning ? Now ? The accountants coming in .
NICHOLAS: Sorry Harry . En boro . En boro . NICHOLAS exits .
HARRY: Nicholas !
NICHOLAS: That 's enough . That 's enough .
HARRY: Nicholas . Can you believe that ? ROB and SOPHIE , an American , enter .
ROB: Shit , fan and hitting ? Hey ! Fat Laki ! You know why they call this guy Fat Laki ?
SOPHIE: Wow . Congratulations .
FAT LAKI: I stopped eating bread . It 's sad though . I loved bread . But . What can you do ?
ROB: This is Sophie . Just relocated from our New York office .
SOPHIE: Hello . Really pleased to meet you . Can I just say , I 'm a huge fan of Greek food . Especially the cakes . I love Baklava .
HARRY: Great . The ship 's going down and we 've got baklava .
ROB: I take it the banks are pulling the ug ? What are the bastards proposing ?
FAT LAKI: They 've demanded the 300 million we orrowed . Thirty by close of play .
ROB: Sweet mother of God . They are sons of itches .
FAT LAKI: They 've taken a new position on the value of the property development . It 's triggered the guarantees .
SOPHIE: Can you sell it ?
HARRY: It 's not even a building site yet .
SOPHIE: So , its bankruptcy .
ROB: Put something offshore , I said . He wanted to pay his taxes .
HARRY: Maybe I should have been more Greek about it .
ROB: Hey . It 's bankruptcy baby . Not disaster .
HARRY: Accountants . When it 's good , they get paid . When it 's bad , they get paid . I want my son to be a lawyer for the same reason . He does n't get it . So what are the options ?
ROB: Well , the obvious is to buy back you own business .
SOPHIE: Trick is finding the investors to back you .
HARRY: And the banks will sell back to me ecause ?
ROB: Because nobody makes pink slop like you do Harry .
SOPHIE: The banks just want a quick sale . They have no interest in running you usiness .
HARRY: Let 's jump on it .
ROB: I 'll talk to private equity firms , VCs , angels . The usual suspects . We 'll find someone .
SOPHIE: What does n't break you , makes you .
HARRY: Ah . Therapy . Do n't charge me fo that , will you ? Rob ? Do n't let he charge me for that .
KATIE: They 're going through my things . It 's disgusting .
HARRY: Are they darling . It 's temporary . You 'll get it all back .
RUPERT: Morning .
KATIE: Oh . Hi .
NIGEL: Problem .
RUPERT: This is the kitchen .
NIGEL: Fabulous finishes .
HARRY: So how long 's this going to take ?
RUPERT: Most of the day , I should think .
HARRY: And what are we allowed to keep ?
RUPERT: Ah , well . According to the asset sheet let 's see . Not very much .
KATIE: Little rats , with their little claws .
MRS PARRINGTON: That is quite unnecessary Katie .
RUPERT: We may as well do this now . That 's a nice computer . Oh , do n't worry we 're not going to , you know , take it now . Anything interesting ?
THEO: Stocks . Everyone 's selling . I 'm uying . Two , Four , Eight , 16 , 32..
MRS PARRINGTON: Double your numbers quietly Theo and apologise or I 'll confiscate that wretched computer for a week .
THEO: Sorry .
RUPERT: There 's no easy way of doing this .
NIGEL: You have impeccable taste , by the way .
MRS PARRINGTON: It 's not mine .
RUPERT: We operate very strict guidelines .
NIGEL: We have your range of Greek dips at home . Do n't we Rupert ?
RUPERT: As I was saying , we operate very strict guidelines .
HARRY: So . What is legally ours ?
RUPERT: Well , the bank will let you keep £25,000 in cash . And you 're each allowed £1,000 in personal items .
KATIE: My Westwood Gold Label cost more than that .
NIGEL: It 's such a beautiful dress . I could n't resist looking .
KATIE: I love it too .
NIGEL: I 'll sort something out for you .
KATIE: Thank you !
RUPERT: Nigel .
NIGEL: You seem like such a lovely family . We hate doing this .
RUPERT: Nigel .
HARRY: Right , so 25k cash . And 1000 in personal items . What else ?
RUPERT: Ah . Well . One thing that came up in the meeting with HQ this morning . The fish and chip shop . The Three Brothers ?
JAMES: What fish and chip shop ?
MRS PARRINGTON: That went years ago .
RUPERT: Well , the bank is unable to seize it as an asset because of its co- ownership with a Spiros Papadopoulos ?
HARRY: Right .
MRS PARRINGTON: Yes , that 's his brother . But they have n't spoken in years .
SPIROS: It was so strange . Oh , James - more lemon son .
MRS PARRINGTON: Still so charming .
SPIROS: So , I 'm sitting there watching the telly and suddenly I see Papadopoulos & Sons . On the TV .
THEO: Daddy over leveraged himself .
SPIROS: Look at this little Englezo . Hey ! I 'm your Uncle Spiros re . I 'm your uncle , e manga ! I 'm going to eat him he 's so cute .
THEO: Please do n't eat me .
SPIROS: Re gugluthi . He 's just like his mother . A little Englishman .
THEO: That 's because my Mummy was English .
SPIROS: Ah ! I know re ! I know . Ah . So ! I 'm watching the news and I 'm thinking , what 's my baby brother gone and done now ? And just at that moment .
MRS PARRINGTON: She 's still a little spoilt .
KATIE: Nanny P !
JAMES: And dumpy .
MRS PARRINGTON: Not so dumpy .
SPIROS: Ah , James . Sweet baby James . When you were three . How old was he ? Three o four ? We used to play fight . Remember ? You loved to fight . Why , you broke my nose . Yeah ! Fuck that hurt !
MRS PARRINGTON: Spiros .
SPIROS: Oh . Sorry . Duck ! I said duck . .
THEO: I know what you said .
SPIROS: Do n't tell your father . Harry . Thank you for phoning me . No , seriously . I 'm so grateful . There 's , you know I know there 's so much that we need to sort out , you and I .
HARRY: Well .
SPIROS: But we should be celebrating . Yeah ? I do n't drink anymore . Just so you know . But you do n't have to be drunk to dance . That 's what I say now . You do n't have to be drunk to dance !
HARRY: Fantastic . So . Look . We 're losing the house and well everything . It 's only temporary . I 'm in negotiations with a top corporate finance team to buy it ack . But in the meantime , I need to free up some capital .
SPIROS: I 'll give you whatever I 've got but you know , I do n't have much money .
HARRY: I do n't want your money Spiro . I want to sell the Three Brothers . We 'll split it 50/50 . I get enough money pay the rent , pay a few bills off and it 's great for you because you get some cash to do whatever it is you want to do .
SPIROS: You ca n't sell the Three Brothers .
HARRY: I knew it ! I knew you 'd be difficult . I knew it , I knew it , I knew it . You have n't changed .
SPIROS: No , it does n't feel right .
HARRY: You 're loving this .
SPIROS: No Harry . I want to help .
HARRY: Ca n't you see we 're in the shit ?
MRS PARRINGTON: Gentlemen , please . May I suggest we sleep on this ? Before it gets out of hand .
SPIROS: Yeah . This is good advice Mrs P .
MRS PARRINGTON: Harry ? Harry ?
HARRY: Okay . Whatever .
SPIROS: I could n't sleep last night . Not a wink . Over and over , in my mind , I was trying to imagine selling the shop . Something here was saying , no , no . I want to help you . All of you . So I prayed for guidance . I asked the Universe . Please help me . Please help me help these people . And I must 've fallen asleep not long after . A crazy sleep . And then this dream . Banayia mou . There was this , this music . The most incredible music . And you and me Harry . Running the shop . I woke with tears in my eyes and I knew .
HARRY: Sorry . What are you going on about ?
SPIROS: We are going to reopen the Three Brothers .
THEO: Brilliant !
KATIE: Is he talking about us ?
JAMES: Yeah , I think he is .
HARRY: There 's nothing there .
SPIROS: Exactly . It 's empty . Useless . We 'd get nothing for it . But if we made the Three Brothers great again . Hey ! That is our destiny ! Okay . It needs work . Sure . But destiny need work .
HARRY: You 're still crazy .
SPIROS: We have . You . You have a better chance of getting through this if we increase the value of the shop .
HARRY: I 'm not opening a fish and chip shop , I 'm Papadopoulos & Sons , I 'm on supermarket shelves .
KATIE: God . What would I tell my friends ?
JAMES: Do n't know , maybe the truth ?
KATIE: I do n't know , maybe the truth .
JAMES: God . Fuck off .
KATIE: F.. f.. fuck you .
MRS PARRINGTON: Enough !
SPIROS: People ! Hear me out . If we get it up and running again , we can sell it as a going concern instead of an empty shop . This deal you 're working on could take ages . In the meantime , you 're getting cash in and you 're saving money because it 's got two edrooms . Eh ? The Three Brothers is a goldmine . Used to be . Can be again .
HARRY: When did you become so practical ?
SPIROS: I 'll get it fixed . I 'm a handyman now .
MRS PARRINGTON: I thought you were a waiter Spiros .
SPIROS: Around too much booze Mrs P. I went travelling . Belgium , America , Brooklyn . I ended up managing a block of apartments in LA . I do painting , decorating , plumbing , electrics , everything .
MRS PARRINGTON: A man who can fix things .
SPIROS: I 've got a van .
HARRY: Oh . It 's alright everyone . Do n't panic . He 's got a van .
SPIROS: Let 's go look at the shop . Let me go and start working on it now .
HARRY: You 're out of your mind . I know what you 're up to . You want to make some money for yourself . That 's fine . It 's okay . It 's okay . At least you 're thinking smart these days . But do n't involve us in all this .
SPIROS: I want to help .
MRS PARRINGTON: Given the current situation , I think it 's worth consideration .
HARRY: What ? I 'm not opening a fish and chip shop . I 'm not . I 'm not ! I 'm not ! I 'm not ! Not ! Not ! What ?
MRS PARRINGTON: May I have a private word ? Now .
HARRY: Mrs Parrington , with all due espect
MRS PARRINGTON: You are the father of this family .
HARRY: I 'd rather boil my own head than go ack to a chip shop .
MRS PARRINGTON: What a terrible thing to say . Really .
HARRY: He 's unreliable Mrs P. He 's irresponsible , he 's a talker . He sings . He dances . He plays the bongo drums . He 's a waiter . He 'll drive us all mad and leave us broke .
MRS PARRINGTON: He seems reformed to me . He does n't drink anymore . I think he wants to help .
HARRY: Moving back to a chip shop will destroy my children 's confidence .
MRS PARRINGTON: Seeing you behave like a spoilt brat will do that perfectly well .
HARRY: We 're going to smell of fish and chips .
MRS PARRINGTON: The children need a home . I do n't give a fig for your bourgeois snobbery . Look at you . Everything has to be a drama with you Greeks . Show some gumption man .
SPIROS: So many memories .
KATIE: Are we really going to live in that ?
THEO: Oh .
JAMES: I 'm trying to find something good .
KATIE: And ?
JAMES: No . Nothing .
SPIROS: Nonsense . You 'll love it ! We 're going to have a crazy time . We 're going to fix this place up . I 'm going to teach you how to do some Greek dancing , some singing . We 'll fry some good fish . We 'll laugh . Good times .
HASSAN: I do n't believe it .
MEHMET: What ?
HASSAN: The Greeks are back .
MEHMET: What Greeks ?
HASSAN: Those Greeks . Hello my old friends . Mehmet . Find out what they 're up to .
SPIROS: See . It looks much worse from the outside .
KATIE: It 's actually a fish and chip shop .
JAMES: Of course it is you spanner .
KATIE: Daddy . Really ?
THEO: What 's this ?
SPIROS: This is Mr Charles . Our lucky fish . He helped us make the busiest chip shop in London . SPIROS takes in a deep breath .
HARRY: Wasting it . Gambling it . Losing it .
SPIROS: Happy days .

ROB: Parents . Is Matt your
SOPHIE: Ex .
ROB: Right . A bit of a tosser , yeah ?
SOPHIE: I would n't say tosser exactly . We just wanted different things .
ROB: Yada , yada , yada . Yeah , I hear ya . It 's like me and my ex . She was keen and everything but I do n't know , her forward thinking sort of killed the romance . Yeah . It 's good to have these little chats . Should n't always be about work . Society is so work obsessed . Tragic . Right . Back to work .
HARRY: Some big names .
ROB: Pap & Sons is still a cash cow .
HARRY: What 's the potential deal structure ?
ROB: That 's the pisser .
SOPHIE: You 'd still be key to running the usiness , but
HARRY: But ?
ROB: Money is n't cheap Harry . These guys will want at least 95 % of the company .
HARRY: Leaving me with nothing . I 'd do the same thing . I 'd be CEO of Papadopoulos & Sons . Get a salary . Get my house back . My children 's future .
ROB: It beats fish and chips .
SOPHIE: You 'd be working for someone else .
HARRY: I 'd be working for someone else . By the way , I 'm not actually running a fish and chip shop . Just helping my other relaunch .
ROB: Sure . Listen , there maybe anothe way . Came up in conversation with the Norske Velconan Bank . It 'd be along the lines of a straight loan to buy back the business .
HARRY: Why would they lend me the money ?
ROB: Well . Let 's ask them . Want me to look into it ?
HARRY: Sure , no choice . ROB 's mobile alarm goes off .
ROB: Okay . Cool . Got to go . Got an emergency with - get this - a high tech portable toilet company - that has literally gone down the tubes . An internet ready , wireless , crappe with a waterproof keyboard and screen . For the love of God . Because taking a dump needed an overhaul . Still , somebody 's got to bury them . Inomine patre , Spiritu , Sanctu etc , etc .
SOPHIE: Got to love a downturn .
ROB: Laters . ROB exits . SOPHIE starts to pack her files .
SOPHIE: I think what you 're currently doing with your brother sounds liberating .
HARRY: I 'm liberating myself of my last 25 grand on a disused chip shop .
SOPHIE: But its like a startup . Is n't that the most exciting phase of any venture ? Taking a bit of a risk . Developing your products and your services . Learning about your market . Look , some of the largest companies on the planet never make a profit . Like a real profit . It 's all accounting tricks and leveraged debt . What I 'm trying to say is , does it matter if the business is a small one ? As long as it makes a profit and the people who work there are happy ?
HARRY: What are you doing working in a place like this ?
SOPHIE: This is only temporary . I got divorced ecently . Came to London for a fresh start . I 'm actually looking into setting up my own business .
HARRY: Well , I 'm sorry about that . About the divorce , I mean . Not
SOPHIE: I 've been meaning to ask . Can I come and visit your shop sometime ?
HARRY: There is n't one .
SOPHIE: When it 's up and running .
HARRY: It 's a chip shop . It 's hot . On you feet all hours . Verbal abuse from customers on a Friday night .
SOPHIE: I was n't applying for a job Harry . Just wanted to stop by . SOPHIE exits .
SPIROS: It 's late . What are you doing little man ?
THEO: Trading . I watch trends . Making trades ased on patterns . I do n't even look at the fundamentals .
SPIROS: The fundamentals ?
THEO: You know , capital employed , gearing atios etc . Not even turnover o profit . It 's short term , but I can spot a trend . I know what 's going to happen .
SPIROS: So , you can see the future ? And ?
THEO: Same as the past . The pursuit of orde from chaos . I 'm done for today . SPIROS takes the laptop and closes it .
SPIROS: Ah ! Theo , Theo , Theo . Guglouthi mou . Kali Nichta . Onira ylica . Sweet dreams .
THEO: Uncle Spiros ? You knew my Mummy .
SPIROS: Yes . She was She was beautiful . And she was very kind to me .
THEO: I wish I had my Mummy sometimes .
SPIROS: It 's very hard for you .
THEO: I 'd have made her laugh , Uncle Spiro .
SPIROS: You make me laugh .
THEO: I 've come out with some classics . Real gems . Wasted on this family .
SPIROS: Ha ! You are something else .
KATIE: We can hear everything.. KATIE and JAMES are at the doorway .
JAMES: Do n't fall for him Spiros . He 's a little tinker .
KATIE: Say the magic release poem !
THEO: No .
JAMES: Actually , say it the magic release poem .
THEO: No
SPIROS: Ah , your kids are something else .
HARRY: No .
SPIROS: Remember how excited we felt when we got this place ? It feels like that again . Hey . My gut says push Alaskan Pollock . Over Cod ! What do you think ?
HARRY: I should never have taken out that loan .
SPIROS: Ah . We 'll talk fish after we fix this place . We 'll talk fish afte we fix this place . Katie 's got some good thoughts . Says we should keep the old look . And she had some beautiful ideas about the uniforms .
HARRY: But then , you know . The potential yield of the Plaza . Papadopoulos Plaza . Fully developed with a thousand year lease . I would have kept the freehold . I 'm telling you Spiro . It was good . I 'd have been worth a fortune . Worth , I do n't know . One illion five . One billion six . One illion six . Big numbers Spiro . Big , ig numbers .
SPIROS: We were children when we came to the UK with nothing . We start again . Fat Laki . The weight you lost is an inspiration . Phil The Till . You 've helped many Greeks with your tax friendly till machines . Eh , only two things are certain in life - death and taxes . Unless you 're Greek . Then it 's only death ! . Nikos , Kyriaco , Androniki , Loula , Uncle Panikos , Aphrodite , Maria and of course , Father Jimmy . Thank you . Thank you , thank you , thank you .
HARRY: Did n't Father Jimmy get done fo selling illegal copies of Rambo ?
SPIROS: He 's got three liquor stores in Palmers Green .
HARRY: He always hated me . HARRY now addresses the small crowd .
UNCLE PANIKOS: What did he say ?
SPIROS: James , music .
HARRY: You 're supposed to do that after you launch something .
SPIROS: To hell with convention .
SPIROS: Hade re Laki . Tell us .
FAT LAKI: Entaxi . Do n't rush me . Its been a long time since I had meat like this .
THEO: What 's he doing ?
MRS PARRINGTON: He 's assessing the competition .
SPIROS: E belame mas .
FAT LAKI: There 's a reason Hassan 's still in usiness . Texture , very good . Way above average . Meat content . High . Mechanically recovered cheap ubbish ? You wish . This is a quality donner , nicely cooked with all the right combination of herbs . It 's beautiful .
SPIROS: It does n't mean we ca n't take them on .
FAT LAKI: No . I 'm not saying we ca n't . MEHMET walks into the shop and freezes .
HARRY: Yes ?
MEHMET: Sorry . I I
HARRY: What do you want ?
MEHMET: That 's a lot of Greeks . Katie grabs her coat .
KATIE: What ? We 're going out .
MRS PARRINGTON: Not too late . KATIE exits with MEHMET .
HARRY: We 'll make a better product at a cheaper price with larger portions . We 'll lose money on the kebabs in the short term , put Turks out of business within a year , make our margins on the fish and when the rest of this crummy street has packed up we 'll raise ou prices and cut our portion sizes .
SPIROS: The entrepreneur has spoken .
HARRY: Hey , it 's temporary , but as long as we 're here we 'll do some business .
SPIROS: You know , when he was a little boy , he 'd come home from school and sit there - just like that .
JAMES: Who was the third b.. brother ?
HARRY: Michael . He died in the fire . With ou parents , your grandparents , in Cyprus . In the war between the Greeks and Turks .
JAMES: How did you both escape ?
HARRY: Spiros climbed down and Michael who was six ?
SPIROS: Yeah .
HARRY: Dropped me down . I was just a baby .
SPIROS: I caught him . But Michael He . I told Mihalis to jump . But he he ran ight back into the house . We 'll neve know why . One night and everything changes .
JAMES: He probably wanted to save his Mum and Dad .
SPIROS: You know what ? I never thought about that . You could be right . Yeah . You are a wise boy James . Your soul is old . Tell me . This has always been a big question for me . For many years . Do you think do you think I could 've done something else ? For Michael ?
JAMES: No . You were holding a baby .
SPIROS: Yeah .
JAMES: And how old were you ?
SPIROS: I was nine .
JAMES: Well , you were only a boy . Like Theo . HARRY has stopped eating . He looks troubled .
SPIROS: H ? Hello ? What 's wrong with him ? Hey . Do n't worry . It 's temporary !
HARRY: Excuse me . HARRY exits .
SPIROS: Did I say something wrong ?
HARRY: He was only nine . I never thought about how young he was .
JAMES: I got you this . Tea .
HARRY: James . Come here . Sit down . I 've let you and your brother and your siste down .
JAMES: Dad .
HARRY: I made a promise to your mother that I 'd take care of you .
JAMES: And you 're doing that .
HARRY: This is humiliating for you .
JAMES: Dad , we 'll get through this . Like I do n't know . Like King Lear .
HARRY: I do n't know the story .
JAMES: Well , King Lear loses everything . Absolutely everything and he finds himself in the middle of this storm with nothing and all his kids h.. h.. hate him . They think he 's a prick .
HARRY: What happens to him ?
JAMES: Well . He dies .
HARRY: Oh .
JAMES: But it has to end like that because its a tragedy .
HARRY: I 'm sorry about your plants .
JAMES: I can grow new ones .
HARRY: Why did n't you bring more with you ?
JAMES: I did n't want to get in the way .
HARRY: You 're such a sweet boy . You get that from your mother . Your stammer is getting better . You know what ? I 'm going to go and get your plants . Now . From the house .

SPIROS: You 're overreacting Harry .
HARRY: The thought of her pregnant . In a kebab shop .
SPIROS: Harry . Do n't worry about Katie . She can look after herself .
HARRY: What are you doing ?
SPIROS: I 've got something to say .
HARRY: About Katie ? Is she pregnant ?
SPIROS: No .
HARRY: Oh God . Have you 've got cancer ?
SPIROS: No .

SPIROS: There were aspects of my ehaviour which were unacceptable . This includes , and is not limited to .
HARRY: Why now ?
SPIROS: I 've been carrying this . Well , if you do n't want to hear we can do it later .
HARRY: No . Now is fine . Now is good .
SPIROS: Just . Oxi . Oxi . Skip that . I have abused you generosity .
HARRY: I agree with that statement .
SPIROS: When we were children and got to London I looked after you . Got you eady for school . Made you do you homework . I taught you to cook , ride a ike , speak Greek . Dance . Why do n't you speak Greek re ?
HARRY: You were reading your list .
SPIROS: I fought with Stephen Klein , when he accused you of stealing his orthopedic shoe . Remember that ?
HARRY: Yeah .
SPIROS: Did you take it ?
HARRY: No .
SPIROS: You can tell me now .
HARRY: I did n't steal the shoe . Are you going to read all of that ?
SPIROS: I do n't have to .
HARRY: Why did it go wrong with us Spiro ? We may as well get to it . Why did you turn against me after I left the shop ?
SPIROS: I never turned against you .
HARRY: That 's what it felt like .
SPIROS: I was jealous of you .
HARRY: You were my brother .
SPIROS: Brothers get jealous .
HARRY: You were more than a brother .
SPIROS: You were my life and then you left . Gone .
HARRY: I set up the business . I was n't going to stay in the shop . You could 've come with me .
SPIROS: Harry , you were so fast . You were like a plane , like a supersonic jet .
HARRY: But I gave you everything you wanted . Did I ever once turn you down ? In all the years after I left the business . Did I ? And after it went bust ? But it was never enough . Every week something new . Writing a cheque to I do n't know . You had some weird friends . Who was that loke with the pin head ? Kept turning up at the house .
SPIROS: None of my friends anymore .
HARRY: And then drunk at Elizabeth 's funeral ? And your big 'tell it as it is ' speech .
SPIROS: I heard about it .
HARRY: That was it for me . For us .
SPIROS: You were right to cut me off .
HARRY: She never had a bad word for you Elizabeth . Always forgave you . And she made me forgive you . Every time .
SPIROS: She did . I always had a way back when she was with us . Elizabeth was so good to me . She was our world . She was our world .
HARRY: I 'm sorry , I ca n't .
SPIROS: It 's okay H .
HARRY: I 've got to get to this meeting . It 's an important meeting .
SPIROS: It 's okay to miss her .
HARRY: Oh man . Just give me a minute .
ROB: With the help of Lars and the Norske Velconan Bank , we aim to buy Pap and Sons back from the receivers .
LARS: Also , I have to say Harry that I elieve there is an intuitive bond etween the Greek and the Nordic peoples , yah ? And so , maybe the very first vikings were descended from Ancient Greeks , somewhere in the deep mists of time . And so it 's so so Wagnerian , yah ?
SOPHIE: We should point out the new approach .
ROB: To buy Papadopoulos & Sons but divest the food manufacturing side of the usiness .
HARRY: Divest the food manufacturing ? What else is there ?
ROB: Sell off the food but keep the property .
LARS: Papadopoulos Plaza . It 's going to be worth a fortune .
HARRY: That 's not what I had in mind .
SOPHIE: It 's an asset breakup .
LARS: Tusk . Tusk , yah ? Makes us sound like arbarians .
ROB: With the new loan , you 'd buy back you old assets and then sell off the ands in the Pap & Sons stable .
LARS: Yah . And you know how to squeeze the value Harry .
SOPHIE: That 's a break up .
HARRY: Please . I know what it is .
LARS: The pitta bread , the cakes get sold to a bakery .
ROB: The halloumi and feta to a dairy company .
LARS: I love your halloumi ! Grilled . It 's
ROB: The sell off value of these brands will exceed the new loan .
LARS: So my bank will get its money back faster than you can say 'knife ' .
HARRY: And what do you get ?
ROB: Lars wants 50 % of the Plaza development . Which is what will remain after the debts have been settled .
HARRY: So you get 50 % of the development fo free .
LARS: Sure , yeah . But you get 50 % of the same development yah , also fo free .
SOPHIE: What do you want Harry ?
HARRY: I want my food business back .
ROB: Guy , guys , guys . Reality check . Harry . It 's not going to happen . Okay ? The est you can hope for is to work with Lars here and save something .
HARRY: I ca n't say no .
LARS: Okay . So . Yah . I need to take this to the board . Take two , three months . But pish , yah ?
SOPHIE: It seems criminal to buy the business ack only to break it up . As an aside to SOPHIE .
ROB: Can I just point out that you are skating . Figuratively speaking . On thin fucking ice .
HARRY: I 'll do whatever the bank wants .
LARS: Okay ! Harry , we are going to take this to the hoop , yah ? Three points ! Yah ? Three points !
SOPHIE: Taking out a loan to pay off a loan ? So you can remortgage a property ? It 's got nothing to do with business . It 's got nothing to do with making stuff .
HARRY: I get my life back .
SOPHIE: No . You get a loan for some land .
HARRY: My children get their lives back .
SOPHIE: I 'm sorry . This is n't very professional .
HARRY: Do you give all your clients a hard time Sophie ?
SOPHIE: No . Just the interesting ones .
HARRY: You got five minutes ?
SOPHIE: Yeah . Of course .
HARRY: Just want to talk about the shop and make sure my brother 's got the right plan before I go .
SOPHIE: Okay . Let 's grab a coffee .
SOPHIE: So it 's 30 % on materials . The fish , the potatoes , the packaging etc . Would you include energy ? Light , heat ?
HARRY: Yeah . But not rent because we already own the building .
SOPHIE: Okay . And 30 % on labour ?
HARRY: Yeah .
SOPHIE: So it 's 30/30/30 . Classic restaurant model .
HARRY: That 's right .
SOPHIE: What are your weaknesses ?
HARRY: The price of fish can vary . Dramatically .
SOPHIE: Can you vary the menu ?
HARRY: You do n't want to complicate it .
SOPHIE: It does n't have to be complicated Harry . What are your fears ?
HARRY: My fears ? Oh . Just that it just wo n't work out . That fish and chips has maybe had its day .
SOPHIE: No . Hang on a second . Fish and chips is a British classic . It 's much more than just a quick meaningless experience . It 's something to be savoured . Just think of the soft , white , cod flakes , gently falling away as you fork pierces the hard , crunchy shell of the golden batter . The ich smells of a fryer 's delight . The tangy smack of salt and vinega on your lips . Hell yeah . I 'd pay for that .
HARRY: Yes . We should We see HARRY and SOPHIE walk down South Bank .
MEHMET: What ?
KATIE: This time last year I was in Malibu .
MEHMET: We 'll go tonight .
KATIE: It 's not a nightclub . It 's America .
MEHMET: Oh . Look . The shop 's where I 'm from ut it 's not where I 'm going to end up .
KATIE: My Dad must 've said that to my Mum once . Maybe even on this bridge .
MEHMET: See . Look where he ended up ?
KATIE: So , what 's your plan ?
MEHMET: Property . Got an eye for it .
KATIE: I 'll probably be a pop star one day .
MEHMET: Cool .
KATIE: Yo , yo , yo ! It 's time to die Yo , yo , blue bottle fly
MEHMET: That is well sick !
KATIE: Yeah . I wrote something for you too . It 's a poem . It 's called , 'Sometimes I want for nothing else ' . Just you and me . In an eve expanding Universe . Sharing a cup of tea . Sometimes , I want fo nothing else .
MEHMET: Fuck . You 're amazing . MEHMET and KATIE start kissing again .
MRS PARRINGTON: Lovely . Come and try . Fresh fish . Lovely hot chips . Come and try . Little boy . Battered inside . Special chip for you ? And one fo you . Fish and chips , come and try . We batter our own fish .
HASSAN: It 's not just fish and chips .
SPIROS: There 's room for all of us .
HARRY: What do you want Hassan ?
HASSAN: Remember when we were children ? When we were friends . We were n't Greeks , Turks . Respectfully , I would like you to take your kebabs off the menu . This is a fish and chip shop .
SPIROS: What do we get ?
HASSAN: I wo n't do fish .
HARRY: You do n't do fish Hassan .
HASSAN: You are going to put us on the street .
HARRY: It 's business .
HASSAN: It 's not about business . Perhaps you would not be like this if we were Greeks .
HARRY: I 'll tell you what . We 'll take kebabs off the menu , if you ask your son to stay away from my daughter . HASSAN thinks about this . He sips his tea .
SPIROS: More tea ?
HASSAN: No . Thank you . This is very difficult .
HARRY: Come on . It 's easy .
HASSAN: My son is his own man .
HARRY: Right . There 's no deal .
HASSAN: Is this because he 's Turkish ? Because he 's a Muslim ?
HARRY: Oh no . I do n't have a problem with that .
SPIROS: Harry 's not like that .
HASSAN: Because he works in a kebab shop ? Is that it ?
SPIROS: Yeah . Harry 's more like that .
HARRY: I would ask you - both of you - to espect a man 's aspiration for his daughter .
HASSAN: I have similar aspirations for my son . Spiro , perhaps you should remind you other where he is now . Tell him to look around . Perhaps he still sees a ig mansion with gardens and servants . Well , I do n't . But more importantly , neither does my son .
HARRY: This is only . We 'll be gone in a couple of months .
HASSAN: I hope so . It 's going to be a very long couple of months .
HARRY: For both of us .
THEO: Say cheese !
HARRY: So , here we are .
SPIROS: Here we are .
MRS PARRINGTON: I 'm sure it will be good news .
HARRY: If it 's good news Spiro , I want you to have the shop . All of it .
THEO: Will we get to visit Uncle Spiros again ?
MRS PARRINGTON: Yes , of course we will .
SPIROS: Who 's going to help me to run the store ? I 'm going to need you little man .
MRS PARRINGTON: I expect Uncle Spiros will always find you a holiday job here .
HARRY: Hello . Lars . Yeah . I 'm just
MRS PARRINGTON: What is it ?
THEO: Did you get the loan ?
HARRY: Bad news I 'm afraid .
KATIE: Really ?
HARRY: Yeah . We 're going home ! We got it ! We 're going home . The family 's response is muted .
SPIROS: Congratulations .
HARRY: What 's wrong ? We 're leaving , we 're out of here . We got the loan . We should be celebrating . The family are still unmoved .
SPIROS: He 's right . It 's a good day . You , you made it . You 're a survivor . Sorry .
HARRY: What is it with you Spiro ? Why ca n't you be happy for me ? Whenever I have any kind success you always have to stamp on it . Where are you going ?
SPIROS: I am happy for you . I am .
HARRY: What is it ? What 's wrong ? Spiros staggers off .
SPIROS: There is this SPIROS collapses onto the floor .
THEO: He looks dead to me .
MRS PARRINGTON: No , he 's not dead . He 's sleeping . He 's still sleeping .
THEO: Like sleeping beauty ?
MRS PARRINGTON: Yes . That 's a good way of looking at it . SOPHIE enters . SOPHIE is carrying a cake .
SOPHIE: Sorry . I hope I 'm not .
HARRY: No , no . Come in . James , James . And take the erm
SOPHIE: Yeah , I heard the news and I really wanted to bake something so I made a Greek Easter cake . Do n't ask .
HARRY: No . That 's really lovely . Thank you very much . We 'll , we 'll have some of that . He 's in a mild coma apparently and we have to talk to him and play music and James , put the turn the music on . Hey , wake up . The accountant 's here . You 've got to wake up .

HARRY: Wait ! I can felt something . Katie . Get the doctor .
KATIE: I do n't want to ask .
JAMES: Oh for fuck 's sake , I 'll go shall I ? James exits and fetches a female doctor .
HARRY: Doctor . I felt something just now . A gripping movement .
DOCTOR: Anything else ?
HARRY: No , just a slight squeeze , is that a sign ?
DOCTOR: It could be a decorticate response . It 's difficult to tell .
HARRY: Right . How long 's he going to be like this ?
DOCTOR: He 's suffered a heart attack . It 's hard to predict . You should all take a eak . I 'm sorry about him .
MRS PARRINGTON: Yeah . Okay . We 'll leave you to it . Come on . We 'll just say goodbye to Uncle Spiros . The family depart . SOPHIE also goes to leave .
HARRY: Would you mind staying around ?
SOPHIE: Of course .
HARRY: So , he saved me twice . Once in the fire , and once after the banks . I was always embarrassed by him , you know . By his thing that he does . You know , his 'thing ' . But the thing that he does . It 's a good thing really . These last few months . This year actually . This whole year . God . What a year . What a year . And yet . I 've never felt so alive . I 've never felt so engaged . Why is that ? I mean why ? I mean , I 'm frying chips . SOPHIE shrugs with smile .
SOPHIE: It 's okay . It 's okay .
HARRY: It 's a crazy , crazy , world . It 's up , it 's down . You fight . You win .
SOPHIE: I 'll get someone . SOHPIE exits .

ROB: I just want to talk .
HARRY: I do n't want to do the deal .
ROB: Harry , you have seriously lost the plot on this one .
HARRY: It just does n't feel right .
ROB: We worked hard on this .
SOPHIE: If he does n't want to do the deal , he does n't want to do it .
ROB: Shut up .
HARRY: Hey . No need for that .
ROB: I do n't understand .
HARRY: I 've got everything I want . And I 've got no debt . And that feels good . When I lock up my shop at night , it feels good . I 've got no debts , no loans . I own it 100 per cent .
ROB: Come on . A percentage of something that could be worth millions . You 'd walk away from that ? For a chip shop ?
HARRY: Yeah . Right now ? Yes . I would . And I 'm with my children . And that 's . You ca n't put a price on that Rob . And I 'm having fun . We 're having fun . Come ack to the shop and let me cook you something to eat . Go on . We 're doing great business . I 'm actually thinking of expanding .

HARRY: What is success Rob ? What is it ? We 've both had it . What is it ? Is it the share price ? Is it the profit earnings ratio ? Is it a eautiful car .

SALMA: Why is the witch always a hideous old crone with a pointy hat and a oomstick ? I do n't believe it 's historically accurate , Mrs Henscher !
MRS HENSCHER: It 's not supposed to be . It 's supposed to sell postcards and key chains .
CLAPS HANDS: So let 's try it again . Top of page six , Norman . Norman skips ahead on his scroll .

NEIL: Because I 'm fat . And my allergies make my eyes leak . And I sweat when I walk too fast . And I have a lunchbox with a kitten on it . And I have Irritable Bowel Syndrome . I guess there 's a whole bunch of stuff .
NORMAN: Does n't it bother you ? ParaNorman 14 .

NEIL: Do n't blow this for me , Mitch . This one 's not weird . He talks to dead people .
A BEAT: So does everyone come back as a ghost ? ParaNorman 18 .

DEAD JUDGE: You must stop the curse . A beat . Norman is stunned .
NORMAN: What ? You do n't want to kill me ?
DEAD JUDGE: You can speak to the dead . To us . To her . We need you to read from the book to send us all back to the grave .
NORMAN: But it did n't work ! It 's a fairy tale ! Just a bedtime story He narrows his eyes at the Judge .
DEAD JUDGE: We were scared .
NORMAN: Of what ?
DEAD JUDGE: Of her .
GESTURES BEHIND: I believed we were doing what was ight . I was wrong . Now this is our punishment .
MORE: ParaNorman 75 .

NORMAN: Something nobody ever did before . I 've got ta go talk to her .

NORMAN: He says `` take a left here '' .
PERRY BABCOCK: We 've already been this way . We 're going around in circles !
SANDRA BABCOCK: Maybe we should pull over and ask someone ?
PERRY BABCOCK: Oh , right , you think maybe we should stop at a graveyard and dig up some other eighteenth-century corpses ?
SANDRA BABCOCK: It 's not a bad idea .
PERRY BABCOCK: I wish I understood you .
NORMAN: Turn down there !
SANDRA BABCOCK: Oh my , do you think that 's it ? ParaNorman 83 .

NORMAN: Hello ? Words echo around him in response .
AGGIE: You 're not welcome here . Go away . Norman shivers as the voice RUMBLES coldly .
NORMAN: Uh I really need to speak with you .
AGGIE: Who are you ?
NORMAN: I 'm Norman . Norman Babcock . You do n't actually know me , but I know you . We 're actually kind of the same , you and I .
AGGIE: You 're not dead .
NORMAN: Well , no , apart from that .
AGGIE: And you 're a boy .
NORMAN: Well , yes , that too .
AGGIE: You 're not like me at all .
NORMAN: Well , I know how you feel ?
AGGIE: No you do n't . You do n't know anything about me .
NORMAN: I know your name is Agatha Prenderghast . The ghostly voice wavers for the first time .
AGGIE: What ?
NORMAN: And I know you 're probably tired . Right ? Because , I mean , it 's eally late and it 's been a long night and we 're , like , only eleven years-old , and The voice snaps back like a clap of thunder .
AGGIE: I do n't want to go to sleep , and you ca n't make me ! I burnt the ook into dust , and now I do n't have to listen to that stupid story any more ! Leave me alone !
NORMAN: No . I 'm not leaving . Just listen to me . Uh once upon a time long ago there was a little girl ParaNorman 86 .
AGGIE: What ?
NORMAN: A little girl who was different from the other people in he village .
AGGIE: I 'm not listening ! LA-LA-LA-LA-LA-
NORMAN: She could see and do things that no one could understand , and that made them scared of her .
AGGIE: I do n't like this story !
NORMAN: She turned away from everyone , and ecame sad and lonely , and had no one to turn to .
AGGIE: Stop it !
NORMAN: But the more she turned away from people , the more scared they were of her , and they did something terrible !
AGGIE: No !
NORMAN: But even though she was dead something in her came back .
AGGIE: Stop ! ParaNorman 87 .
NORMAN: And this part of her would n't go away , not for three hundred years
AGGIE: Shut up !
NORMAN: And the longer it stayed , the less there was of the little girl !
AGGIE: I 'll make you suffer !
NORMAN: Why ?
AGGIE: Because because
NORMAN: Because you want everyone to hurt just as much as you are ! So whenever you wake up you play this mean game , but you do n't play fair !
AGGIE: They hurt me !
NORMAN: So you hurt them back ?
AGGIE: I wanted everyone to see how otten they were !
NORMAN: You 're just like them , Agatha .
AGGIE: No I 'm not !
NORMAN: You 're a bully .
AGGIE: No I 'm not !
NORMAN: They did something awful , but that does n't mean you should too !
MORE: ParaNorman 88 .
AGGIE: That 's not true !
NORMAN: Then stop . This is wrong and you know it ! You 've spent so long emembering the bad people that you 've forgotten the good ones . There must have been someone who loved you and cared for you . You do n't remember them ?
AGGIE: Leave me alone !
NORMAN: But you 're not alone ! You have to emember !
AGGIE: Keep away from me !
NORMAN: Remember ! There is a flash of white , and silence .
AGGIE: Aggie . My name was Aggie . ParaNorman 89 .
BROW FURROWS: And then those horrible men came and took me away and I never saw her again !
NORMAN: Sometimes when people get scared they say and do terrible things . I think you got so scared , that you forgot who you are . But I do n't think you 're a witch . Not really . Aggie looks into his eyes .
AGGIE: You do n't ?
NORMAN: I think you 're just a little kid with a really special gift who only ever wanted people to understand her . He smiles softly .
AGGIE: But what about the people who hurt you ? Do n't you ever want to make them suffer ? Norman thinks this over , and shrugs .
NORMAN: Well , yeah , but what good would that do ? You think just because there 's bad people out there that there 's no good ones either ? I thought the same thing .
MORE: ParaNorman 90 .
AGGIE: I just want my mommy
NORMAN: I 'm sorry , Aggie . She 's gone .
AGGIE: That story you were telling . How does it end ?
NORMAN: I think that 's up to you .
AGGIE: Is this where they buried me ?
NORMAN: It 's a pretty good place to sleep . Then you can be with your mom again .
SANDRA BABCOCK: Norman ? Norman !
NORMAN: Mom , you 're embarrassing me .
SANDRA BABCOCK: That 's my job .
COURTNEY: Good job , Norman .
PERRY BABCOCK: Well done , Son . You did it .
DEPUTY DWAYNE: So , uh , are we gon na need statements ? She slaps it out of his hand .
MRS HENSCHER: You know what it 's like . You join a mob and you say things . I was merely inhabiting the role .

ALVIN: Yeah , me and Norman are in a lot of the same classes . Pretty much inseparable . Best buds . And we do a lot of psychic investigations together . We have a blog actually , you should check it out .
COURTNEY: So I was thinking , maybe we could catch a movie sometime ? Nothing scary .
MITCH: That sounds great , Kathy ! Y'know , you 're gon na love my boyfriend ! He 's like a total chick-flick nut !
NORMAN: Hey Neil .

ARTHUR: It 's not possible for you to be here . He smiles as if he 's solved the problem .
JIM: But I am .
ARTHUR: Sorry , Jim . My specialty is cocktails and conversation . Take your fancy trick questions to one of those Infomats . They think they know everything .
JIM: Arthur , I 'm in trouble . I 'm screwed . I am completely , ridiculously screwed .
ARTHUR: Lot of self-pity .

JIM: Okay .
ARTHUR: I 'll bet even if you got your wish , you 'd still feel this way . Not in the ight place . Supposed to be somewhere else . That 's not a crisis , it 's the human condition . Jim takes a moment to consider that .
JIM: That 's not me .
ARTHUR: Well , maybe not . The point is , you ca n't get so wrapped up in where you 'd rather be that you forget to make the most of where you are .
JIM: What are you telling me ?

JIM: A woman . A passenger .
CAFETERIA: Jim pours milk over a bowl of cereal .

JIM: I know . I know .
ARTHUR: I do n't know . I 've never been on an island .
JIM: Okay . Say you figured out how to do something that would make your life a hundred times better . But it 's wrong , and there 's no taking it back . How wrong would it have to be to stop you ? I mean , what if it made you life a thousand times better ? How do you do the math ?
ARTHUR: Jim . These are not robot questions . Jim stares at Arthur in frustration .
JIM: I know how to wake up Aurora .
ARTHUR: Sounds like a fine idea . You could use some company .
JIM: I 'd be stranding her on this ship fo the rest of her life !
ARTHUR: Oh . Well , you ca n't do that . Jim buries his face in his hands .
JIM: What am I going to do ?
ARTHUR: Jim . I 'm here for you .
LOOKING UP: Arthur , you 're a machine .
JIM: I 'm shaving off my beard . It 's wrong , man .

SHOUTING: I 'll come down .
AURORA: Passenger or crew ?
JIM: Passenger . Jim Preston .
AURORA: I 'm Aurora .
JIM: Yeah , Isame for me .
AURORA: The crew 's supposed to wake up a month before we do . But I have n't seen anybody . Jim swallows hard .
JIM: The crew 's still sleeping . They 've got a special facility . I can see them in there but I ca n't get in . Aurora stares at him .
AURORA: You 're saying nobody 's awake ?
JIM: Just me .
AURORA: Just you ?
JIM: Just us .
AURORA: But somebody 's got to land the ship in a few weeks .
JIM: I have to show you something .
AURORA: Typical . There 's so much incompetence in these big companies . No accountability ! They lost my luggage on the flight to the spaceport . I 'm leaving the planet and my bags almost did n't make it ! And nobody apologizes . Nobody even feels bad .
JIM: The Observatory .
AURORA: Eighty-nine years to go .
JIM: The other passengers are n't late waking up . We 're early . Aurora stares at Jim .
AURORA: We 've got to get back to sleep .
AURORA: Nobody strands me on a spaceship fo a hundred years . I work for the New Yorker . I 'll write an expose so hot you 'll need oven mitts to read it . Trust me .
JIM: It 's not that simple . Putting somebody into hibernation takes special equipment . Remember the facility where they put us to sleep ?
GETTING IT: You do n't think there 's a way back into hibernation .
JIM: Not that I can see .
AURORA: There has to be . There 's always a way . Where 's the crew ?
JIM: A year and three months .
AURORA: Oh , my God . No .
JIM: Aurora !
AURORA: I ca n't even find the one I 'm supposed to be in .
JIM: I should n't have told you like that .
AURORA: No , I 'm sorry . It just hit me how serious this is . How did you wake up ?
JIM: I just did . I woke up , my pod dumped me out , and there I was .
AURORA: Me too . We have to get help .
JIM: I 've sentsixteen messages to Earth . A bunch to the Homestead company , one to the Space Administration , one to the United Nations . A couple to Homestead II , just for the hell of it . My phone ill 's about eighty grand .
AURORA: How soon could we hear something ?
JIM: With speed-of-light lag , fifty-six years . That 'll be from Earth . Nothing from Homestead II until we 're almost there anyway . Eighty years or so . Aurora 's mouth goes dry . She swallows hard .
AURORA: What about the other planets ?
JIM: The other occupied worlds are even farther away . We 'd die of old age efore they could answer .
AURORA: What about other ships ? Jim ?
JIM: I never thought of other ships .
AURORA: Jim , you 've had more than a year ! There has to be a flight plan o something
JIM: The computer knows . Give me a ship .
AURORA: The starship Zephyr .
JIM: Round-trip message lagninety-nine years .
AURORA: The starship Andromeda .
JIM: One hundred thirty-two years .
AURORA: The Maximilian .
JIM: Eighty-one years . Jim and Aurora deflate visibly .
AURORA: That 's the closest one .
JIM: You just came out of hibernation . It 'll be a couple days before you 're a hundred percent . You should rest .
YAWNING: I think I have to .
JIM: I 'll walk you to your cabin .
AURORA: No , I 'm all right .
JIM: Okay .
AURORA: Jim . Do n't look so down . It 's going to be okay . You 've got me on the team now . Chin up , all right ? Jim nods , speechless .
JIM: I 'm in the Berlin Suite if you need me . She stops . Turns to look back at him .
AURORA: A year and a half ? Must have been hard .
JIM: It was .
AURORA: Good night , Jim .
JIM: Whiskey . Rocks .
ARTHUR: Sure thing . How 's your day been ? Jim takes a stiff drink .
JIM: Aurora 's awake .
ARTHUR: Congratulations . You do n't look happy .
JIM: Arthur . Can you keep a secret ?
ARTHUR: I 'm a bartender .
JIM: Do n't tell Aurora I woke her up . She thinks it was an accident . Let me tell her . Okay ?
AURORA: How can there be no way to put someone into hibernation aboard ship ? What if a pod breaks down ?
INFOMAT: No pod has malfunctioned in thousands of interstellar flights .
AURORA: Well , I 'm awake .
INFOMAT: Hibernation pods are fail-safe . Jim appears behind Aurora .
JIM: Good morning . Have you eaten ?
AURORA: I 'm starving . This is the dumbest machine .
AURORA: You 're a man of simple tastes .
JIM: I 'm a silver class passenger . The French Breakfast Puff is above my pay grade .
AURORA: Oh , no ! All this time ? What can I get you ?
JIM: No , I 'm fine , really
AURORA: Shut up . I 'll be right back .
JIM: Thank you . They dig in .
AURORA: You think the crew members would know what to do ?
JIM: I was hoping so .
AURORA: Could we wake them up if we got in there ?
AWKWARDLY: I 'm no expert . But I think so .
AURORA: Maybe there 's another way to go to sleep . Did you check out the infirmary ?
JIM: I looked around . It 's the usual hospital stuff . Scanners , autodocs .
AURORA: Did you look for ways of going to sleep ?
JIM: Not really .
AURORA: Well , Jim !
JIM: You think they 've got suspended animation pills sitting around ?
AURORA: You do n't know until you look . What about cargo ? Maybe there 's a hibernation machine in the hold .
JIM: I looked at the manifests . It 's mostly farming stuff , industrial machines . We 're not going to find a hibernation facility in a box .
AURORA: You do n't know that ! We have to think ig here . Maybe we can build our own hibernation machine .
JIM: No , we ca n't .
AURORA: You 're not even trying !
JIM: I 've been awake a year and a half . I 've tried everything I can think of .
AURORA: Well , it looks to me like you missed some possibilities . And I 'm not ready to give up .
WORKSTATION: No plans are available .
AURORA: What about research articles , any kind of technical documents ?
WORKSTATION: Hibernation technology is proprietary . The following articles deal with the subject on a theoretical level .
COMMUNICATIONS BOOTH: Planet and connection , please .
AURORA: Earth . The New Yorker magazine , office of the Editor in Chief .
COMMUNICATIONS BOOTH: Begin message .
JIM: No .
AURORA: And there 's no magic sleeping drugs in the infirmary .
JIM: No .
AURORA: I did find the gene bank . Five thousand sperm and egg samples on ice . I should be glad they do that . By the time we get to Homestead II , that little capsule in the freezer is going to be all that 's left of me . We eally are screwed , are n't we ?
JIM: Pretty much .
AURORA: So who are you , Jim ? I 'm going to be seeing you around . I should know who I 'm talking to .
JIM: I 'm from Denver . Lived there all my life .
AURORA: What kind of work do you do ?
JIM: A little of everything . Transport , obotics , industrial systems . I fix what 's broken . On the emigration forms I 'm a `` rate two '' mechanical engineer . Means I do n't have a Ph.D .
AURORA: Neither do I . But a journalist does n't need one ; she just needs a way with words and an attitude . I 'm from Manhattan , so I had the attitude .
JIM: I noticed .
AURORA: And the words have always been there when I needed them .
SHE LAUGHS: I would never have lasted a year with no one but robots to talk to . They 're all such idiots !
JIM: Not all of them .
ARTHUR: Evening , Jim . Who 's the lovely lady ?
JIM: Arthur , this is Aurora . Aurora , Arthur .
ARTHUR: Aurora . A pleasure . He takes her hand formally .
AURORA: Arthur ! Lovely to meet you .
ARTHUR: What 'll it be ?
AURORA: Dirty martini !
TO JIM: Now this is a robot I can talk to .
JIM: Android , technically .
TO ARTHUR: Whiskey and soda .
COLLECTING HERSELF: My God , I almost forgot my life is in uins . That wipes the smile off Jim 's face .
JIM: Sorry .
AURORA: What for ? It 's time to sleep . In the morning we 'll think of something illiant .
JIM: All right .
AURORA: Good night , Jim . Good night , Arthur . She exits .
ARTHUR: Good night . She 's wonderful . Excellent choice . Jim drops his head into his hands .
AURORA: Of course !
JIM: What ? She pulls him down the hall , chattering .
AURORA: It takes too long to get to Homestead II . But we 're still closer to Earth . We 'll turn the ship around .
ELEVATOR: Aurora drags Jim in and punches the button .
AURORA: We 'll go home .
JIM: It would take decades .
AURORA: It 's our only chance of getting off this ship in our lifetimes .
AURORA: Where 's thenavigating place ?
JIM: That way . But She drags him toward the Bridge .
AURORA: We can learn how to pilot the ship . We have all the time in the world .
JIM: There 's just one problem .
AURORA: Oh .
JIM: Sorry .
CRUSHED: That was my last good idea .
AURORA: New file . My Voyage .
AURORA: Vanished , like a dream , in the blink of an eye . She falters , frightened by her own words .
JIM: Do what ?
AURORA: Emigrate . Leave Earth . I 'm interviewing you .
JIM: You 're what ?
AURORA: Interviewing you . You 're the first victim of hibernation failure in the history of space travel . That makes you news .
JIM: Who are you going to tell ?
AURORA: Posterity . So why 'd you give up you life on Earth ?
JIM: I , uhI never really
AURORA: Were you running away from something ?
JIM: No . Things were okay .
AURORA: So ?
JIM: I just wanted more , I guess . You know . More room . A fresh start . Back to basics .
CHIDING: That 's HomeStead Company propaganda .
JIM: I guess .
AURORA: Jim !
JIM: I 'm a mechanic . A rate-two mechanic . We 're a dying breed on Earth . But in the colonies , they still have problems to solve . My kind of problems . In the colonies , a handyman is somebody .
AURORA: Now you 're back to advertising .
JIM: Ca n't it still be true ?
AURORA: You know how much the Homestead Company 's made off its first planet , Homestead I ? Over eight quadrillion dollars . That 's eight million illions . Colony planets are the iggest business there is . Did you pay full price for your ticket ?
JIM: No , I 'm in a desirable trade .
TRIUMPHANTLY: So they fill your head with dreams , discount your ticket , and you fly off to populate their planet and pay HomeStead ten percent of everything you do for the rest of your life . You think you 're free ? You 're just part of the business plan . Jim waves at the rows of sleepers .
JIM: All you see here is five thousand suckers ?
AURORA: I see zeroes on the HomeStead Company 's bottom line .
JIM: I see five thousand men and women changing their lives . For five thousand different reasons . You do n't know these people .
AURORA: Banker .
JIM: Gardener .
AURORA: She 's too silly to be a Donna . I think she 's a Lola .
JIM: Madison . Chef , accountant , o midwife ?
AURORA: She has to be a midwife . There 's no way you made that one up .
JIM: She 's a midwife . I did n't know they still had midwives .
AURORA: Married , or strangers ?
JIM: Married .
IMPRESSED: Yes .
JIM: Sixteen , twenty-six , or thirty-six ?
AURORA: I 'd almost say sixteentwenty-six .
JIM: Right .
AURORA: Politician , historian , or artist ?
JIM: I do n't know . Artist ?
AURORA: It does n't say . But I 'll tell you this I like her . We 'd be friends . Jim looks at Aurora seriously .
JIM: You think you can see that ?
AURORA: Do n't you ? Jim looks at the woman in the pod . Smiles .
JIM: Yeah .
AURORA: That was my plan . Travel to Homestead II . Live there for a year and see what emigrating 's really like . Then ack to Earth . I 'm the only passenge on board with a round-trip ticket .
PERPLEXED: I left Earth for a new life . But you end up back where you started .
AURORA: No ! I end up in the future . Two hundred and fifty years in the future . On Earth , which is still the center of civilization , overcrowded or not . And I arrive in the future with an amazing story .
JIM: And what 's this amazing story ?
AURORA: The selling of the colonial dream .
JIM: Big plans .
AURORA: My friends threw me this huge farewell party . Everyone came . It was the happiest , saddest night . And look what it 's all come to .
SHE SIGHS: Jim , I ca n't think of anything else to try . To save us , I mean . I do n't even want to think about it anymore . So . What is there to do around here ?
JIM: Watch your step . I 've made a few changes .
AURORA: I 'm up two points ! She cuts around him toward the basket .
JIM: Wow .
AURORA: You clean up all right yourself . You went shopping .
JIM: I went shoplifting .
CARGO ROBOT: Yes , Passenger Jim !
ARTHUR: Evening . What can I get for you ?
AURORA: A manhattan , please .
JIM: Single malt , rocks . Arthur pours .
ARTHUR: You two look fine this evening .
CONFIDENTIALLY: We 're on a date !
ARTHUR: Very nice .
AURORA: Took you long enough to ask .
JIM: I was giving you space !
AURORA: Space is one thing I do n't need more of . I 've been doing research .
JIM: Really ? !
AURORA: But it 's not suspended animation . We 'd still be aging .
JIM: Oh .
AURORA: Yeah . If I have to grow old on this ship , I 'd at least like to be awake for it . So that was a failure .
JIM: A highly ambitious failure .
AURORA: There 's the title of my memoir . `` A Highly Ambitious Failure , '' by Aurora Dunn . Jim laughs . He thinks for a minute .
JIM: `` Voyage to Nowhere , '' by Jim Preston .
LAUGHING: `` My Life in a Tin Can . ''
JIM: `` A Spaceship Built For Two . ''
AURORA: Incredible .
JIM: Yeah , me too . Well , good night . He turns to go .
AURORA: Jim .
AURORA: This is so good . I 'm starving . Last night was just what I needed .
JIM: You are the most beautiful woman I 've ever seen . You 're so beautiful it hurts me .
JIM: You okay ?
AURORA: Yes , I 'm fine . It 's just
JIM: I know .
AURORA: Be careful .
JIM: Back by happy hour .
AURORA: The Polynesians set out into the Pacific Ocean with no destination . Searching for islands . They sailed into the endless sea on faith .
ARTHUR: What 's that ?
AURORA: I 'm writing , Arthur . Hush .
JIM: Hi . How was your day ?
AURORA: I do n't know . I wrote a few pages . I 'm not sure what I 'm doing anymore . I was writing a book , and I was keeping a diary . But the book and the diary are running together . I think I 'm writing about us .
JIM: Makes sense to me .
AURORA: I 'm not sure I want to write about this life . I do n't even know how to think about it . I live in a palace . But it 's also a prison . I 'm moving at half the speed of light and I ca n't go anywhere ! Jim takes that in .
JIM: The cargo hold is full of pionee gear . There 's a submarine down there , can you believe it ? Ships and airplanes and bulldozers . That 's what I wanted , a world still being built . But I 'll never see it . They sit for a moment in glum contemplation .
AURORA: Did you find anything that could help us ?
JIM: Yes . I found these .
AURORA: Are they real ?
JIM: I cut them myself .
AURORA: Thank you .
JIM: You 're welcome . She looks into his eyes .
AURORA: For very unlucky people , we got pretty lucky .
JIM: It 's coming ! Run !
BREATHLESSLY: That was incredible .
JIM: Closest we 'll get to a star on the whole trip . Happy birthday .
SINGING: Happy birthday to you Happy birthday to you Happy birthday , dear Aurora Happy Birthday to you .
ARTHUR: Birthday cocktail for the birthday girl .
AURORA: Are n't you going to check my I.D. ? I might not be old enough to drink .
ARTHUR: I 'd never ask your age in front of a gentleman .
AURORA: Jim 's not a gentleman . Anyway there 's no secrets between me and Jim .
ARTHUR: Is that so ?
JIM: You heard the lady . Be right back . He walks away .
AURORA: You know what I like about you , Arthur ? You have a sense of occasion . I bet ladies fall for you on every trip .
ARTHUR: I 'd say you were pulling my leg , but I have n't got any .
LAUGHING: Exactly ! There you go .
ARTHUR: I remember your last birthday , a yea ago . Jim was really looking forward to meeting you .
AURORA: What ?
AURORA: What do you mean , he was looking forward to it ? How could he
ARTHUR: He could n't stop talking about you , let me tell you . He spent months deciding whether to wake you up . Aurora eyes widen in shock .
AURORA: Jim woke me up .
ARTHUR: Oh , yes . Said it was the hardest decision of his life , but I see it worked out just fine .
JIM: What ?
AURORA: Did you wake me up , Jim ?
JIM: Yes . I woke you up .
IN AGONY: How could you do it ?
JIM: I tried not to .
AURORA: You pulled me out of hibernation . You destroyed the rest of my life . You murdered me !
JIM: That 's a little strong
AURORA: You murdered me . I 'm going to be sick . Oh , my God . II ca n't see . She gets up to leave .
JIM: Aurora . He goes after her .
AURORA: Get away from me !
BITTERLY: How did you decide ? Did you just go shopping ? A couple thousand women in their underwear , and you get to pick your favorite .
JIM: It was n't like that .
AURORA: What was it like ? And you had it all planned out ! Dinner and movies and our big dateOh , my God ! And I just ate it up . Fake ! All fake !
JIM: This was real . I did n't plan this . Ithappened .
MOCKING: `` Find true love on the Starship Excelsior ! Romance between the Stars ! The woman of your dreams ! '' Was it everything you thought it would be ?
JIM: Aurora . I love you .
AURORA: This is sick . Show me how you did it .
JIM: I looked at my pod . A couple different processors burned out at the same time . I triggered the same failure in your pod . Short circuit across these two contacts , and then these two . And cut these wires .
AURORA: Just like that .
JIM: Just like that .
AURORA: I 'm so stupid . I fell for all of it . I fell for you . I thought you saved me . But you did n't save me , Jim . You did this to me . And now I 'm stuck with you . Stuck with the second-rate mechanic who ruined my life .
LAMELY: Rate two mechanic . But Aurora 's already walking away .
JIM: Can I talk to you ?
AURORA: I do n't want to talk anymore . I do n't want to look at you anymore . If you see me coming , get out of my way . If you see me sitting , find somewhere else to be . There 's plenty of choices . It 's a big boat .
AURORA: Watching me through a robot is creepy , Jim . Cut it out .
ELITE DECK: Aurora circles the atrium . OVER THE P.A . SYSTEM Jim clears his throat .
JIM: The day I first saw you , my life changed . I could n't forget your face . I kept coming back to see you . Trying to know you through the glass . I read every word you ever wrote , trying to hear you . The day you woke up
AURORA: That 's great , Jim . Just great . I 'm glad that ruining my life somehow improved yours . But I have a run to finish , so
DRUNK: You ! Tuesday 's my day with Arthur . You 're trespassing .
ARTHUR: Actually , today 's Wednesday .
JIM: I slept through Tuesday ?
AURORA: Forget it . The bar 's all yours . But I 'd say a drink is the last thing you need . You 're pathetic . Aurora leaves . Jim takes a seat .
ARTHUR: What 'll it be ?
JIM: I 'm going to kill myself .
ARTHUR: Why 's that ?
JIM: I 'm a murderer .
ARTHUR: Who 'd you murder ?
JIM: Aurora .
ARTHUR: But she 's alive . She was just here .
JIM: She wo n't talk to me . She wo n't let me tell her what happened . How I fell in love with her . How I want to be with her . And I 'm not sorry I woke her up . I 'm not . I love her . And you know what ? She loves me .
SOBBING: Gim me another bottle .
ARTHUR: I think you 've had enough .
JIM: You know what ? You 're right . I 've had enough .
AURORA: I have n't written in days . I do n't know why . It 's the old problem , I guess . Who 's my reader ? Who am I talking to ? What 's it for ?
SHE SIGHS: I used to love it .
AUTODOC: Two separated ribs . Fracture of the ight arm , radius and ulna . One fractured finger . Dislocated thumb .
JIM: Am I gon na be okay ?
AUTODOC: Leave the bandages on for one week .
JIM: Thanks , doc .
AUTODOC: And take better care of yourself .
AURORA'S MOTHER: I promise you we 'll think of you every day . When you wake up , I know we 'll be gonebut you just know that we lived our lives remembering you , and holding you in our hearts . I do n't understand , baby . I 'm trying , ut I ca n't believe I 'm losing you . I hope you find what you 're looking for . I hope it makes you happy . Aurora watches , devastated .
ARTHUR: Hello , Jim . Whiskey ?
JIM: Iced tea .
ARTHUR: Coming up . Are you getting my arstool dirty ?
JIM: Got to get dirty to get things done , Arthur . If your hands are too clean , it means you 're not making anything .
ARTHUR: And what are you making ?
JIM: Improvements .
AURORA: I need you . The last thing Jim expected to hear .
JIM: Wow . You do need a repairman .
AURORA: I 'm fine , Jim . Thanks for your work .
GUS: Who did that ?
JIM: Jim Preston . Rate-two mechanic .
GUS: Mechanic , huh ?
TO AURORA: And who are you ?
AURORA: Aurora . Aurora Dunn .
GUS: Gus Mancuso , Senior Deck Chief . Nice to meet you . How long have you been awake ?
AURORA: A year .
JIM: Two years .
GUS: This is not good .
GUS: I always get a hibernation hangove ut this is the worst ever .
HE DRINKS: So it 's just the two of you ?
JIM: Yeah .
GUS: Two years . Ouch . You know what it means , right ? There 's no way back into hibernation .
AURORA: I was hoping you 'd know something we did n't .
GUS: No . We 're awake for the duration . How far along are we ? You know ?
JIM: Thirty-two years . Eighty-eight years to go . Gus blows air .
GUS: That 's tough . Hibernation failure ! They said it could n't happen . And now three on one trip . Aurora shoots Jim a look . Gus does n't notice .
JIM: You have no idea how long I 've been trying to get in here .
GUS: Now you 're in . Do n't touch anything .
GUS: We 're on course.Whatever 's wrong with the ship , NavComp 's still minding the store .
JIM: What do you think is wrong ?
GUS: Three pod failures ? Something 's wrong . Question is what . He turns to leave .
AURORA: Wait . What about diverting the ship ? Can we go back to Earth ? Gus almost laughs .
GUS: We 're going forty percent of lightspeed away from Earth . To go home we 'd have to come to a stop , accelerate back towards Earth , and then come to a stop again . It 'd take as long as going on to Homestead II . Anyway , navigation 's not fo amateurs . Space is a big place , and a planet 's just a little thing .
GUS: I thought we 'd see a lot of red lights here . That would mean trouble .
AURORA: So everything 's okay ?
GUS: No , if everything was okay we 'd see a lot of green lights here .
AURORA: What does no lights mean ?
GUS: No lights means big trouble . Diagnostic Computer 's down . We 've got some work to do .
JIM: What do you need ?
GUS: Right now ? Cheeseburger .
JIM: So where you from , Gus ?
GUS: Grew up in Chicago . But I 've lived on this ship a long time . The Excelsior 's made five inter-planetary uns , and I 've been on every one . I live aboard . When she makes port , I live where she lands until she lifts again .
JIM: How old does that make you ?
GUS: Fifty-six .
JIM: But how long ago were you born ?
GUS: Oh . Hang on About six hundred years ago .
AURORA: You should rest .
GUS: I think I will . Tomorrow morning , eight bells , you meet me beside that tree of yours . Until I figure out what 's wrong with the Excelsior , you work for me . Jim and Aurora smile .
JIM: Yes , sir .
AURORA: Good night , Gus .
JIM: I 've missed you . Aurora stares , caught off guard . She gets up .
AURORA: See you in the morning .
GUS: The CPU 's burned out , can you believe it ? Why should that happen ? It 's ated for five hundred years .
AURORA: Can you fix it ?
GUS: You do n't fix it , you replace it . There are spares for everything in storage . Make a note . Diagnostic Computer CPU . And a new cooling fan , this one looks shot .
AURORA: Got it .
GRAND CONCOURSE: Gus and Aurora stand waiting as if for a bus .
AURORA: Do n't take this the wrong way - I wish for your sake you were still asleep - but I 'm glad you 're here .
GUS: Thank you , sweetheart .
JIM: The golf cart .
GUS: This I like .
GUS: Start ` er up .
JIM: How long will it take ?
GUS: Full diagnostic from a cold start ? Days . But it 'll tell us everything .
CONCOURSE BAR: Gus walks up to the bar .
ARTHUR: Chief Mancuso ! Good to see you .
GUS: Good to see you too , Arthur .
ARTHUR: What can I get you ?
GUS: Just an ice water with a little lemon . I feel hot as hell .
AURORA: Thank you .
GUS: All right . Last night I checked ten atmosphere stations and two of them were burned out . Twenty percent failure rate . Unheard of . So we 're going to see how far the rot runs .
TO AURORA: You . You 're going to walk Decks Two , Three , and Four , and check every atmosphere station . Green light good , ed light bad , no light really bad . Write down what you find , I want a complete census .
AURORA: Yes , sir .
TO JIM: You . Go down to the Ship 's Stores . Find atmosphere station CPUs and take an inventory of the spares . I know what the manifest says , but lists ai n't facts .
JIM: Got it .
GUS: I 'm going down to the Hibernation Bay to look at our pods . Maybe I can spot what went wrong . Jim and Aurora exchange glances .
AURORA: That should be interesting .
GUS: Son of a gun .
JIM: I finished .
GUS: I looked at your pod . Very simple . The clock chips burned out . Not supposed to happen , but it 's simple .
JIM: Gus
GUS: You did this .
JIM: Yeah .
GUS: I was thinking what a lucky son of a itch you were , stuck with a beauty like Aurora . But it was n't luck .
JIM: No . Gus sits down heavily , looking at Jim .
GUS: She knows ?
JIM: She knows .
GUS: I could see there was some trouble etween you .
JIM: Here 's your inventory . I 'll be in the machine shop if you need me .
AURORA: I finished the census .
SHE HESITATES: You saw the hibernation pods ?
GUS: Yeah .
AURORA: So you know . What Jim did . Aurora 's chin begins to tremble .
GUS: Yeah , he told me .
AURORA: He told you ? Just like that ? And ?
GUS: No , it 's a bad thing . But Look . When a drowning man drags somebody down with him , you do n't call it right . But he 's drowning . A starving man steals a loaf of bread , what can you say ? You should have starved ?
AURORA: I would have starved .
GUS: Really ?
JIM: We can replace them .
GUS: We will . But they 'll just burn out again if we do n't figure out why it 's happening .
JIM: Where do we start ?
GUS: We wait for the diagnostic report . You 've been knocking around this ship for two years . A few days more wo n't kill you .
AURORA: So how did you end up in space ?
GUS: Only place I ever wanted to be . When I was sixteen I lied about my age and got onto a lunar shuttle crew . A few years later I moved on to planetary ships . Made the Venus run a hundred times , then Jupiter and Saturn . Then the gravity drive came along . Real spaceflight . I did everything I could to get onto an interstellar ship . I was thirty-six years old the first time I saw an alien sun . No going ack after that . I 've walked on seventeen planets in five sola systems .
JIM: That 's incredible .
AURORA: Do n't you feel homeless ?
GUS: I 'm a spacer . My home is where I am . You ca n't take much with you , so you do n't get hung up on things . You have yourself . The things you do . The company you keep .
ARTHUR: Gus always dances with the ladies .
JIM: You have n't seen him at all ?
AURORA: I do n't think he 's up .
JIM: Gus ! Are you all right ?
GUS: No . No , I 'm not .
GUS: Could n't get up . Weak as a baby . What does it say is wrong with me ?
JIM: It 's a few things .
MEDICAL SCANNER: Diagnosis complete .
GUS: What 's the summary ?
MEDICAL SCANNER: Pan-systemic necrosis . Progressive organ failure . Cause unknown .
GUS: I 'll tell you the cause . My goofy hibernation pod is the cause .
AURORA: What 's the treatment ?
MEDICAL SCANNER: No treatment known .
GUS: Prognosis .
MEDICAL SCANNER: Between two and three days .
JIM: Gus !
GUS: Sorry , Jim .
JIM: He 's not in his room .
AURORA: Where are you ? Gus , please answer . We 'll be at the Concourse Bar every hour . I 'm really worried .
JIM: Where is he ? What 's he doing ?
AURORA: Where have you been ?
GUS: Making arrangements . You kids have dinner plans ?
JIM: No .
GUS: Xanadu at eight .
EXITING: Now stop shouting at me .
AURORA: You look magnificent .
TO JIM: Ladies love the dress blues . Thanks for coming . Sorry to run out today , but I did n't have a lot of time , and there was a lot to do .
JIM: How you feeling ?
GUS: Fine , fine .
AURORA: Gus , just because some stupid machine says there 's no cure
GUS: State-of-the-art machine , Aurora . Anyway , I can feel it happening .
AURORA: But you just got here . It 's barely een a week . He takes her hand .
GUS: No point counting the days .
JIM: Why are we standing by the airlock ?
AURORA: Oh , God ! Gus , no !
GUS: Got no choice about going . But I can decide how to go , and I 'm going out on my own two feet .
SHOCKED: Are you sure about this ?
GUS: If you knew how this feels , Jimbo , you would n't ask me to stay .
AURORA: Gus . I ca n't stand it . There 's got to e some other way . Do n't do this . Gus gently frees himself from her arms .
TENDERLY: It 's all right , Aurora . It 's all ight .
JIM: Yes , sir .
GUS: And take care of each other .
AURORA: There 's trouble everywhere . Atmosphere systems , water systems , waste systems , robot control .
JIM: What 's happening ?
AURORA: It started two years ago . Thirty years with no trouble , then forty- seven failures in a single day . Structural concussion . System overvoltage . Transient pressure anomaly . Circuit reset , conduit 12 . Sync failure , hibernation pod 1498 .
JIM: Pod 1498 ? That 's me !
AURORA: Whatever happened that day woke you up .
JIM: Ever since then , more and more failures . Faster and faster .
AURORA: How do we find out what 's going on ?
JIM: We start at the beginning . The eakdowns from the day I woke up .
AURORA: They 're all on Deck One .
JIM: Power Converter seems okay .
AURORA: The failures are all below us .
TOGETHER: Do n't touch anything .
AURORA: It 's beautiful .
JIM: Scares the hell out of me .
AURORA: What keeps it in ?
JIM: Gravity . The gravity plant gives us weight . Propels the ship . And it contains the fusion reaction . All one system .
AURORA: The cluster of failures is still one level down .
JIM: Gus 's card should open any door .
AURORA: Let me try an override code .
JIM: Wait a sec , maybe there 's a reason the door The light flashes green . The door begins to slide open .
AURORA: Jim . Are you okay ?
JIM: I think I 'm all right . Look .
AURORA: A rock .
A BRAINSTORM: The computers are networked . Eve since the core computer got blown away , all the other computers must have been carrying the load . Running at full capacity around the clock fo two years . They 're burning out .
AURORA: And every computer that burns out increases the load on the others .
JIM: Yeah . The breakdown accelerates . If we do n't stop it , the whole ship will go down .
AURORA: I 'm trapped on a sinking ship ?
JIM: Gus said there 's spares fo everything . If we replace the core computer , it 'll pick up the load . The urnouts will stop . Another BEEP . Another green light turns red .
AURORA: Let 's go .
FROWNING: Jim !
GROGGY: I 'm fine .
AURORA: You just got sucked into outer space . Take a break .
JIM: Aurora !
EXASPERATED: I 'm drifting helplessly .
JIM: We 've got to get you down . The gravity might come back on .
AURORA: Whoa . Hey . Let 's talk about this .
JIM: Hang on .
AURORA: To what ? !
JIM: You okay ?
AURORA: There 's no gravity .
JIM: Yeah . That 's bad .
AURORA: Why is there no gravity ?
JIM: The gravity plant 's failing . Internal field goes first . After that the engines diethen the fusion reacto goes nova .
AURORA: That is bad .
JIM: We 've got to get the core compute online . Now .
ANNOUNCER: Reactor failure . Reactor failure . Passengers please remain calm .
JIM: Does the data cable go in the `` bus '' port or the `` through '' port ?
AURORA: Bus port ! The blue one !
JIM: Hold it ! Hold it !
AURORA: Trying !
JIM: Do n't know .
AURORA: We 're alive ! The engines rumble back to life .
JIM: We have to replace the other burned- out computers . But we have time . Aurora slides her arm around his waist .
AURORA: Jim !
JIM: The hibernation system rebooted . It thinks the ship 's in port . It 's ejecting the empty pods .
HORRIFIED: They 're not empty .
AURORA: Hurry .
JIM: I see it .
AURORA: Who 's that ?
JIM: The Captain .
AURORA: You do n't have much time .
JIM: I know .
AURORA: Go go go !
JIM: Got it ! The hibernation pod hums to life .
AURORA: Can we talk ?
JIM: I 've missed you too .
AURORA: I do n't want to be angry anymore . I ca n't be . We 've come through too much . No matter what you 've done the fact is , I love you .
JIM: Hell of a life .
SOUTH CAROLINA: April , 1776
MARION: Damnation !
NATHAN: Father , I saw a post rider at the house .
MARION: Thank you . Did you finish the uppe field ?
SAMUEL: We got it all cut and we bundled half of it .
MARION: Those swimming breaks cut into the day , do n't they ?
GABRIEL: Father , a post rider came from Charleston . You have a lette inside .
MARION: Thank you . How 's the spotted one 's milk ?
THOMAS: Better . She 's near ready to calve .
MARION: and they bundled half almost no trace of the boys you knew
WILLIAM: Father , Samuel broke the blue plate
SAMUEL: I did not
MARGARET: Dinner
GABRIEL: News of Boston , father ?
NATHAN: I hate turnips
SAMUEL: William knocked it right out of my hands
GABRIEL: Father ?
MARION: Samuel , William , both of you clean it up
MARGARET: Charleston !
NATHAN: We 're going to Charleston !
SAMUEL: When , father , when ?
MARION: We 'll leave tomorrow
THE CHILDREN: Charleston ! We 're going to Charleston !
MARION: I love turnips
MARGARET: now count five finger lengths up from the front two stars of the Big Dipper , and that 's the North Star , that 's her .
GABRIEL: The New York and Rhode Island assemblies have been dissolved
MARION: The middle colonies ?
GABRIEL: Rioting both sides of the bay , in Chestertown they burned the Customs House and tar-and-feathered the Customs Agent . He died of burns . In Wilmington they killed a Royal Magistrate and two Redcoats .
MARION: Anything about the convention in Philadelphia ?
GABRIEL: Poor Richard says they 'll make a Declaration of Independence by July .
THE CHILDREN: Aunt Charlotte ! Aunt Charlotte !
CHARLOTTE: Welcome ! Welcome ! Margaret , William , look at you ! They 're huge . What have you been feeding them ?
MARION: They 're from good stock on thei mother 's side .
CHARLOTTE: Thank you .
THE CHILDREN: Presents ! For me ? What do you have ?
CHARLOTTE: Inside , inside
MARION: You look well , Charlotte .
CHARLOTTE: As do you .
MARION: Inside , all of you
THOMAS: Look ! There 's Gabriel !
CHARLOTTE: Children , inside ! All of you ! Right now .
MARION: What news ?
GABRIEL: The British army is barricaded in Boston . Harry Lee , is here from Virginia , recruiting for a Continental Army .
MARION: Is that why the Assembly was convened ?
GABRIEL: Yes . He seeks a levy of troops and money .
MARION: And the Governor ?
GABRIEL: He vowed that if the Assembly votes a single shilling to Lee , he 'll dissolve the body .
MARION: Which would force our delegates in Philadelphia to vote fo independence .
CHARLOTTE: And send us to war alongside Massachusetts .
MARION: Our governor is a bigger fool than I thought .
GABRIEL: Lee is counting on your vote and expects you to be the first to enlist .
SPEAKER: ORDER ! ORDER !
SIMMS: And out last if we vote a levy The ROOM ERUPTS .
SPEAKER: ORDER ! ORDER ! Mr. Simms , you do not have the floor . The ROOM SETTLES DOWN .
LEE: You all know why I am here . I am not an orator and I will not try to convince you of the worthiness of our cause . I am a soldier and we are at war and with the declaration of independence we all expect from Philadelphia , it will soon be a formal state of war . In preparation for that , eight of the thirteen colonies have levied money in support of a Continental Army . I ask South Carolina to be the ninth .
SIMMS: Colonel Lee , Massachusetts may be at war , along with New Hampshire and Rhode Island and Virginia , but South Carolina is not at war .
LEE: Massachusetts and New Hampshire are not as far from South Carolina as you might think and the war they 're fighting is not for independence of one or two colonies . It 's for the independence of a nation .
WITHINGTON: And what nation is that ? Robinson , one of the Patriots , stands up .
ROBINSON: An American nation . Colonel Lee , with your permission ?
LEE: Please .
ROBINSON: Those of us who call ourselves Patriots are not seeking to give irth to an American nation , but to protect one that already exists . It was born a hundred-and-seventy years ago at Jamestown , Virginia and has grown stronger and more mature with every generation reared and with every crop sown and harvested . We are a nation and our rights as citizens of that nation are threatened by a tyrant three thousand miles away .
LEE: Thank you . Were I an orator , those are the exact words I would have spoken . Laughter . Marion rises .
MARION: Mister Robinson , tell me , why should I trade one tyrant , three thousand miles away , for three thousand tyrants , one mile away ?
ROBINSON: Sir ?
MARION: An elected legislature can trample a man 's rights just as easily as a King can .
LEE: Captain Marion , I understood you to e a Patriot .
MARION: It 's Mister Marion .
LEE: I understood him to be a Patriot as well . More laughter .
MARION: If you mean by a Patriot , am I angry at the Townsend Acts and the Stamp Act ? Then I 'm a Patriot . And what of the Navigation Act ? Should I be permitted to sell my tobacco to the French traders on Martinique ? Yes , and it 's an intrusion into my affairs that I ca n't legally . Laughter .
ROBINSON: This from the same Captain Francis Marion whose anger was so famous during the Wilderness Campaign . Marion glares at Robinson , then smiles .
MARION: I was intemperate in my youth . My departed wife , God bless her soul , dampened that intemperance with the mantle of responsibility . Robinson looks derisively at Marion .
ROBINSON: Temperance can be a convenient disguise for fear .
LEE: Mister Robinson , I fought with Captain Marion in the French and Indian War , including the Wilderness Campaign . We served as scouts unde Washington and I have no doubts about Captain Marion 's courage o competence on a battlefield . There 's not a man in this room , o anywhere , for that matter , to whom I would more willingly trust my life .
ROBINSON: I stand corrected .
LEE: Nonetheless , I would like to know , Mister Marion , how how how Lee 's oratorical skills peter out .
MARION: Harry , Harry , Harry
LEE: My hairy arse ! You live in a cave if you think we 'll get independence without war The Speaker POUNDS HIS GAVEL .
SPEAKER: Gentlemen ! Please ! This is not a tavern !
MARION: Was n't it a Union Jack we fought under ?
LEE: A long time ago
MARION: Thirteen years
LEE: That 's a damn long time The Speaker POUNDS HIS GAVEL again .
SPEAKER: Gentlemen ! Please ! Marion and Lee ignore the speaker .
MARION: You were an Englishman then
LEE: I was an American , I just did n't know it yet
MARION: We do n't have to go to war to gain independence
LEE: Balderdash !
MARION: There are a thousand avenues , othe than war , at our disposal
LEE: Name five hundred .
MARION: Royal petition , delegates to court , judicial redress , economic boycott , ibery
LEE: That 's five , keep going
MARION: time , royal succession , egicide , bribery
LEE: You said bribery twice Marion speaks slowly and firmly .
MARION: We do not have to go to war to gain independence .
LEE: Francis , I was at Bunker Hill . It was as bad as anything you and I saw on the frontier . Worse than the slaughter at the Ashuelot River . The British advanced three times and we killed over seven hundred of them at point blank range . And still , they advanced and they took the ground . That is the measure of their resolve . If your principles dictate independence , then war is the only way . It has come to that .
MARION: I have seven children . My wife is dead . Who 's to care for them if I go to war ?
LEE: Wars are not fought only by childless men . A man must weigh his personal responsibilities against his principles .
MARION: That 's what I 'm doing . I will not fight and because I wo n't , I will not cast a vote that will send others to fight in my stead .
LEE: And your principles ?
MARION: I 'm a parent , I do n't have the luxury of principles .
ROBINSON: Mister Speaker , I call for a vote on a levy to the Continental Army .
HAMILL: Second .
SPEAKER: So moved .
ROBINSON: Yea .
SPEAKER: Mr. Hamill .
HAMILL: Yea .
SPEAKER: Mr. Johnson .
JOHNSON: Yea .
SPEAKER: Mr. Simms .
SIMMS: Nay .
SPEAKER: Mr. Marion . No response .
MARION: Nay .
PAGE BOY: Twenty-eight to twelve , the levy passed !
GABRIEL: Father , I 've lost respect for you . I thought you were a man of principle .
MARION: When you have children , I hope you 'll understand .
GABRIEL: When I have children , I hope I do n't hide behind them . Marion looks closely at Gabriel .
MARION: Do you intend to enlist without my permission ?
GABRIEL: Yes .
LEE: One of yours ?
MARION: Gabriel .
LEE: I recognize him now . Is he as imprudent as his father was at his age ?
MARION: No , thank the Lord . He 's more like his mother .
LEE: I 'll see to it that he serves unde me .
MARION: Thank you .
THOMAS: When ?
MARION: Seventeen .
THOMAS: But it 's already been two years and that 's two more years . The wa could be over by then .
MARION: God willing . Thomas considers it , then nods .
THOMAS: Alright . Seventeen .
WILLIAM: Is it going to rain ?
THOMAS: That 's not thunder .
NATHAN: Father ?
MARION: Six-pounders . Lots of them .
MARGARET: How far away ?
MARION: Four , five miles .
SAMUEL: Waxhaus ?
MARION: Just east of it .
MARGARET: Are we safe here ? Marion puts on a smile .
MARION: Do n't worry .
MARGARET: We could go stay at Aunt Charlotte 's farm . She 's to the west .
MARION: No , there 'll be skirmishers on the oads . We 're safer here .
THOMAS: But father , they might come this way .
MARION: Put them away .
MARGARET: Samuel
MARION: Up to the house , now . All of you , come on . Now .
SAMUEL: They 're going to come .
MARGARET: Quiet .
SAMUEL: We 're going to have to fight them off .
WILLIAM: Father will do that .
SAMUEL: They 'll probably kill us men and do Lord knows what to you women .
MARGARET: Samuel !
MARION: Gabriel !
MARGARET: You 're hurt .
THOMAS: The battle , were you there ?
MARION: Margaret , get bandages and water . Thomas , the porch , eyes open .
GABRIEL: Have you seen any Redcoats ?
MARION: Not yet . What happened ?
GABRIEL: It was n't like Saratoga . There , we stayed in the trees , but this time Gates marched us straight at the Redcoats . They fired two volleys into us and we broke like straw . I was given these dispatches I saw Virginia Regulars surrender as they laid down their weapons the British Green Dragoons rode into them and hacked them to bits killed them all , over two hundred men . Marion 's appalled .
MARION: They had surrendered ?
GABRIEL: I have to get these dispatches to Hillsboro .
MARION: You 're in no condition to ride .
GABRIEL: I have no choice , I
MARION: Margaret , take William and Susan down to the root cellar . Thomas , go to the back porch . Nathan and Samuel , the side windows . Keep out of sight .
CONTINENTAL SERGEANT: Thank you . Marion nods , uncomfortable with the thanks .
MARION: Sergeant , there are seventeen wounded men here . Seven Redcoats and ten Patriots , counting my son inside . That puts me in a difficult position .
SERGEANT: I understand .
THOMAS: Father ?
NATHAN: But they 're wounded .
MARION: There are rules , even in war .
TARLETON: You 're surrendering .
CONTINENTAL SERGEANT: Yes , sir .
TARLETON: What unit ?
CONTINENTAL SERGEANT: First Virginia Regulars unde Colonel Hamilton .
TARLETON: Who cared for your wounds ? They hesitate .
CONTINENTAL SERGEANT: We did .
TARLETON: With a lace table cloth ?
REDCOAT LIEUTENANT: These men are of my regiment . Thank you .
REDCOAT: Rebel dispatches , sir . Gabriel steps up .
GABRIEL: I carried those . I was wounded , these people gave me care , they have nothing to do with the dispatches .
REDCOAT LIEUTENANT: I understand .
TARLETON: Lieutenant , have a detachment take our wounded to our surgeons at Camden crossing . Use whateve horses and wagons you can find here .
REDCOAT LIEUTENANT: Yes , sir . He hands the dispatch case to Tarleton .
TARLETON: Who carried this ?
GABRIEL: I did .
TARLETON: Take this one to Camden , he 's a spy . He will be hung .
MARION: Colonel , he 's a dispatch rider and that 's a marked dispatch case .
TARLETON: Fire the house and barns .
REDCOAT LIEUTENANT: Yes , sir .
MARION: Colonel
REDCOAT LIEUTENANT: And the Rebel wounded ?
TARLETON: Kill them .
MARION: A dispatch rider with a marked case can not be held for spying .
TARLETON: We 're not going to hold him , we 're going to hang him .
MARION: But
GABRIEL: Father
TARLETON: Oh , he 's your son . You should have taught him about loyalty .
MARION: Colonel , I beg you , please econsider . By the rules of war , a dispatch rider with a marked case
TARLETON: Would you like a lesson in the rules of war ?
MARION: No lesson is necessary .
THOMAS: Father , do something .
TARLETON: Major .
MARGARET: Thomas , please , Thomas
MARION: Lieutenant , please
REDCOAT LIEUTENANT: I have my orders . Sergeant !
MARGARET: Papa , look what they did to Thomas
NATHAN: Father , they 're going to take Gabriel
MARION: Quiet .
MARGARET: But what about Thomas ?
MARION: Leave him . Take care of William and Susan .
REDCOAT SERGEANT: FORM BY TWOS ! BACK-TO-BACK LINES
REDCOAT CORPORAL: READY
MARION: Samuel , reload . Nathan , untie Gabriel .
MARION'S CHILDREN: Amen .
GABRIEL: The Morgans , the Halseys , Williams , Stantons
MARION: Sleep , now . Marion moves on to Nathan .
NATHAN: Father I killed those men
MARION: Do n't blame yourself , you did what I told you to do .
NATHAN: I 'm glad I killed them I 'm glad
MARION: Try to get some sleep .
CHARLOTTE: I 'll stay with them .
GABRIEL: How are they ? Marion just shakes his head .
CHARLOTTE: They 're asleep .
MARION: How did this how did I let this happen ?
CHARLOTTE: You could n't have known .
MARION: I should have known once I would have I used to be wary and today I watched my son killed before my eyes your sister civilized me and I damn myself for having let her
CHARLOTTE: Thomas is dead but you 've done nothing for which you should be ashamed .
MARION: I 've done nothing and for that I am ashamed . She looks at him closely .
CHARLOTTE: If you go , I 'll care for them as if they were my own .
MARION: I 'll leave in the morning with Gabriel .
WILLIAM: When will you be back ?
MARION: I do n't know , William .
WILLIAM: Tomorrow ?
MARGARET: No , not tomorrow .
MARION: Goodbye ? She just looks at him .
SUSAN: Goodbye . Marion and Gabriel ride away .
MARION: No , it 's too late .
GABRIEL: Father , we have to do something
MARION: It 's already over .
LEE: Damn you , Sergeant , do n't move the wounded twice , put them straight on the wagons from the surgeons .
PATRIOT SERGEANT: Yes , sir .
LEE: Lieutenant , detail men fo outriders . We move out as soon as the wounded are ready .
LIEUTENANT: Yes , sir .
MARION: Green Dragoons came to my home , killed my son , Thomas . It was Tarleton himself .
LEE: I 'm sorry .
MARION: I 'm sorry I was n't here for this .
LEE: There 's nothing you could have done , Gates is a damned fool .
MARION: We saw .
LEE: I begged him to stay in the cover of the trees but he insisted the only way to break Cornwallis was muzzle- to-muzzle . He spent too many years in the British army .
MARION: Where is he now ?
LEE: Last anyone saw , riding hard , northeast , his staff a hundred yards ehind , trying to catch up .
MARION: Who 's in command ?
LEE: I am , I think .
MARION: What are my orders ? Lee gives Marion a tired smile .
LEE: If you want orders , I 've got some for you . Lee ROLLS OUT A MAP for Marion and Gabriel .
MARION: So now Cornwallis will head north , link up with Clinton and finish off Washington .
LEE: And Patriots will start dying on the gallows instead of the battlefield . Unless we can keep Cornwallis in the South until the French arrive . A treaty was signed at Versailles after our victory at Saratoga . The French are sending a fleet and ten thousand troops .
MARION: When ?
LEE: Fall , six months at the earliest .
MARION: Long time .
LEE: The bigger problem is where , not when . The French fleet wo n't sail north of the Chesapeake for fear of early storms .
MARION: So you 're going to try to keep Cornwallis in the South until then .
LEE: Not me , you . I 'm going north with every Continental regular I can find to reinforce Washington or he wo n't last six weeks .
MARION: You expect Cornwallis to be held here by militia ?
LEE: Not held , just slowed down .
MARION: They 're nothing but farmers and you 're asking them to try to keep a tiger in their backyard . They 'd be etter off letting it move on .
LEE: They 'd be better off , but the cause would n't be .
MARION: How many men does Cornwallis have under his command ?
LEE: Four thousand infantry and around six hundred cavalry including the Green Dragoons under Tarleton . At the mention of Tarleton , Marion nods .
MARION: I 'll do what I can . Lee quickly writes something .
LEE: I 'm giving you a field commission as a colonel .
GABRIEL: Colonel Lee , I request a transfer to Colonel Marion 's command .
LEE: Granted .
GABRIEL: What now , sir ?
MARION: We put out the word . We 'll start along the south side of the Santee
GABRIEL: We 'd cover more ground if we split up .
MARION: It 's safer if we stay together . Gabriel steps in front of Marion .
GABRIEL: Colonel , I did n't request this transfer because you 're my father . I requested it because I believe in this cause and this is where I can do the most good .
MARION: Oh ?
GABRIEL: I 've been doing this for two years . I 'm the best scout in the Continental Army , the best horseman , the best shot , the best scavenge and I know every deer path and swamp trail between here and Charleston .
MARION: Is that so ?
GABRIEL: Yes , sir . My father taught me . Marion looks at Gabriel closely .
MARION: Did your father teach you humility ?
GABRIEL: He tried . It did n't take . Marion looks Gabriel up and down .
MARION: Alright , Corporal , you take Bennington , Harrisville , Acworth and the farms along Black Swamp . I 'll take the north side of the river . We 'll meet at Snow 's Island .
GABRIEL: Yes , sir . They mount up .
MARION: And , Corporal be careful .
GABRIEL: Yes father . They ride off in different directions .
MARION: I 'm looking for John Billings .
BARTENDER: He 's dead .
MARION: If he comes back from the dead , tell him Francis Marion is looking fo him .
BARTENDER: I 'll be sure to do that .
MARION: I 'll wait . Miracles happen .
BILLINGS: You expect to hold Cornwallis with militia ?
MARION: I expect to try .
BILLINGS: Trust you and Harry Lee . Remembe that damned overland you two thought up in '62 to hit Fort Louis ?
MARION: It worked . How many men can you aise ?
BILLINGS: Not many . Dalton , Scott , they 've got their reasons ; Rev . Oliver , he believes in the cause ; some of the young bucks ; a few like me with nothing to lose What about you ? You 've got a lot to lose . Marion drains his glass and stands up .
MARION: You coming , or not ?
GABRIEL: Father , this war is about more than Thomas . Marion does n't look up .
MARION: Is it ?
GABRIEL: If you 're here only for revenge , you 're doing a disservice to him as well as yourself .
MARION: How old are you ?
GABRIEL: You know how old I am .
MARION: God help us all when you 're forty .
REV. OLIVER: I heard about your son . I 'm sorry .
MARION: Dalton .
CORNWALLIS: Gentlemen . The officers gather around the map .
MAJOR HUNTINGTON: We have better coming on the trailing supply convoy from Charleston .
CORNWALLIS: A useful place for our maps .
MAJOR HUNTINGTON: I 'm sorry , sir , it wo n't happen again . Tarleton enters , followed by Wilkins .
CORNWALLIS: My harrier . Join us , Colonel .
TARLETON: Sir .
CORNWALLIS: Gentlemen , celebration is premature . We have a difficult campaign ahead of us . We are in predominately hostile country and we can not rely on forage . As we move north , the ulk of our supplies will reach us y sea , through Charleston , which will give us a long and vulnerable supply line , one that can only be secured if the locals are loyal to the crown .
CORNWALLIS' OFFICERS: Yes , sir .
CORNWALLIS: Nonetheless , we must remember that this is a civil war Tarleton proudly holds Cornwallis ' look .
OFFICERS: Yes , sir .
TARLETON: Yes , sir .
WILKINS: I believe he was speaking to us , Colonel .
TARLETON: Did you know that Lord Cornwallis ' father was a tenant on the estate of my grandfather ?
GABRIEL: Less than a mile . Forty-one wagons , a company of Redcoat infantry , horses at the rear .
MARION: Flanking riders ?
GABRIEL: I did n't see any .
REDCOAT LIEUTENANT: Across the river ! Covering fire ! Double rank ! Marion calls to his men .
MARION: Epaulets first Kill the officers .
REV. OLIVER: two-hundred-sixty-six Brown Bess muskets , forty-one casks of powder , alls , tamping
BILLINGS: We have enough arms for an army . Now all we need is an army .
SCOTT: Reamer , boring tool
MARION: Swage , broach , etching tool
FIELDING: A rolling gunsmith 's shop
SCOTT: We can rifle those musket barrels
FIELDING: Get another hundred yards out of 'em
MARION: We 'll need a forge
SCOTT: Easy enough
MARION: We 've got clay to make a chamber
FIELDING: Oak to make charcoal
SCOTT: Oil cloth and barrel staves to make a bellows
MARION: And we can yank a wagon wheel , weight it , rig a piston and drive shaft and we 'll have a flywheel to power the bellows
SCOTT: That 's why he 's a colonel .
BILLINGS: Shoot them ! Shoot the damn things ! Dalton prepares to do so .
MARION: Put that pistol down !
SCOTT: They followed us from the bridge . They wo n't let anyone near the wagon .
MARION: Stay stay stay
ABNER: Rum , French Champagne , Madeira , Port
BILLINGS: No wonder they were guarding it .
REV. OLIVER: My heavens , personal correspondence of Lord Cornwallis .
MARION: These four wagons must be his .
GABRIEL: And the dogs , too , I 'll wager .
BILLINGS: I say we drink the wine , shoot the dogs , and use the papers for musket wadding .
MARION: His journals , letters , maps , ooks Abner calls from another wagon .
ABNER: Colonel , we got a wagon full of officer 's uniforms and more powde and muskets here .
MARION: Today was hard earned but a good start .
DALTON: Like they gave quarter to my family ? My wife and three children were hiding in our root cellar when they came . The Redcoats locked the doo and torched the house .
MARION: You have my sympathy but the order stands .
DALTON: And who are you to give an orde like that ? We all know what you did after Fort Wilderness . That hits home but Marion remains calm .
MARION: I 'm your commanding officer . This is militia , not regular army . I ca n't hold you here , but as long as you stay , you 'll follow my orders .
REV. OLIVER: Thank you .
MARION: For what ?
REV. OLIVER: For trying to impose some decency on that sort .
MARION: Do n't depend on my decency . I 'm one of that sort .
BILLINGS: Am I one of that sort ?
MARION: You 're the worst of that sort . You 're the sort that gives that sort a bad name .
GABRIEL: He should n't make light . That Redcoat should not have been killed .
BILLINGS: He 's not making light . Gabriel shoots Billings a dubious look .
GABRIEL: He 's my father . Billings looks closely at Gabriel .
BILLINGS: Do n't fault him for having grown up on the frontier . It was a harde time and a harder place than you know .
MARION: I 've just been inside the mind of a genius . Lord Cornwallis knows more about war than I could in a dozen lifetimes .
BILLINGS: Cheerful news to greet the morn .
MARION: His victories at Charleston and Camden were perfect , strategically , tactically , logistically . But he has a weakness . They all turn to Marion .
GABRIEL: Father ?
MARION: Pride is his weakness . The men consider that .
BILLINGS: Personally , I 'd prefer stupidity .
MARION: Pride will do . BEGIN MONTAGE Series of shots as follows
CORNWALLIS: Why am I here , Colonel Halbert ?
MAJOR HALBERT: For the ball , sir ? Cornwallis holds his temper .
CORNWALLIS: Why , after six weeks , are we still here to attend a ball . By now , we should be attending balls in North Carolina , not South Carolina .
MAJOR HALBERT: Our supply line , sir ?
CORNWALLIS: Excellent guess , Major .
VALET: Uh I borrowed it from Colonel North . I took it in at the back , added wider epaulets , a court sash and looped gold braiding on the cuffs
CORNWALLIS: It 's a horse blanket . First my personal baggage , then half the bridges and ferries between here and Charleston burned , a dozen convoys attacked . Colonel , if you ca n't secure our supply line against militia , how do you expect to do so against Colonial regulars or the French when they come ?
COLONEL HALBERT: Sir , they 're not like regulars , we ca n't find them and we do n't know when or where they 're going to strike .
CORNWALLIS: How impolite . And who leads these clever , secretive fellows ?
COLONEL HALBERT: We do n't know , sir . He 's called , the Commander by some , the Swamp Fox y others .
CORNWALLIS: Colonel , I 'm a civilized man but I 'm finding to difficult to remain civil . Secure my supply line .
COLONEL HALBERT: Yes , sir .
REDCOAT GUARD: Hey , what you got there ?
BILLINGS: We got our own little party
DALTON: To hell with the officers and thei fancy dress ball
GUARD: Give us a nip , here .
MRS. TALBOT: No ! The beasts took your dogs , as well ?
CORNWALLIS: Fine animals , a gift from His Majesty . Dead now , for all I know .
MRS. TALBOT: Is there no decency ?
MR. TALBOT: Among the rebels ? We know the answer to that .
CORNWALLIS: Yes , we have learned .
MRS. TALBOT: You seem far away .
CORNWALLIS: It 's the weight of command and the lot of a widower memories , loneliness and long gazes at the moon .
MRS. TALBOT: Oh , you poor man
MAJOR HALBERT: Good God !
MR. TALBOT: These rebels seem to lack fear as well as decency , eh , General ?
CORNWALLIS: Colonel Tarleton , you deal with these damned rebels .
TARLETON: Yes , sir .
GREEN: four baskets of apples , salt pork , sweet potatoes , jerky , hard tack , salt and powder . It 's not much , but I 'll get you more .
MARION: We ca n't pay for this
GREEN: I 'll give you what I can , when I can . You pay me what you can .
MARION: Nice to see you again , Anne .
ANNE: I know who you are , Gabriel Marion . The last time I saw you , I was nine and you put ink in my tea .
GABRIEL: I uh that was n't me , it was Samuel I mean Nathan
ANNE: It was you and it turned my teeth lack for a month .
GABRIEL: Uh uh I
GREEN: He 's sorry . Come .
MARION: and your terms of enlistment will be month-to-month . Every thirty days you can re-enlist o eturn to your families .
REED: I 'm in . The others nod in agreement .
MARION: Talk to Abner and Scott about provisions , powder and mounts .
BILLINGS: Twenty men here , seventeen in New Brighton , a dozen along the Black River . We 'll pass three hundred by week 's end if this keeps up .
GABRIEL: If I 'd known you were going to look like this , I never would have put ink in your tea .
ANNE: You call that a compliment ?
GABRIEL: It 's a start .
BILLINGS: He reminds me of you before you got old and ugly .
MARION: No , he takes after his mother
BILLINGS: You got me beat on both accounts .
MARION: The hell I do .
GABRIEL: We 're low on salt . I should go to Pembroke and get some .
BILLINGS: You got salt last week .
GABRIEL: Oh , right . Baking powder , we need baking powder .
BILLINGS: We 've got plenty of baking powder . You went to Pembroke and got five pounds two weeks ago .
REDCOAT SERGEANT: Halt . Look alive , boys .
MARION: Sergeant , this road is closed . Those wagons now belong to the Continental Army .
REDCOAT SERGEANT: Ready arms ! By twos ! Marion 's surprised by the Sergeant 's order .
MARION: Sergeant , there 's no reason for you and your men to die . Just leave the wagons and go .
REDCOAT SERGEANT: Steady , boys
MARION: It 's a trap
REDCOAT SERGEANT: FIRE !
MARION: GO !
TARLETON: Which way ?
GASKINS: This way no this I think
TARLETON: HALT !
GABRIEL: Father , no
MARION: That 's him . Tarleton .
GABRIEL: Father , please
MARION: I should have killed him when I had the chance ?
GABRIEL: When was that ? In the swamp at the expense of your men ? Or when he killed Thomas at the expense of you family ?
MARION: No
GABRIEL: Or perhaps tomorrow at the expense of our cause . Marion is silent .
MARION: Stay the course your mother used to say that to me when I 'd get drunk or lose my temper .
GABRIEL: She 'd say it to me when I picked on Thomas or Nathan .
MARION: You learned her lessons better than
GABRIEL: She got me at a more impressionable age .
ANNE: Next time we 'll bring more blankets .
GABRIEL: That would be nice .
ANNE: Maybe we 'll be lucky this winter and have just rain , no snow .
GABRIEL: That would be nice , too .
ANNE: Just because the French did n't come this fall , does n't mean they 're never going to come .
ROLLINS: They 're to be hung !
GABRIEL: But they 're prisoners-of-war !
REDCOAT SENTRY: Sir .
TARLETON: General , a message from the commander of the rebel militia . Cornwallis reads the message .
CORNWALLIS: It seems our Swamp Fox wants to have a formal parley .
TARLETON: Are you going to meet with him ?
CORNWALLIS: Most certainly . Arrange it .
MAJOR HALBERT: Lord Cornwallis will be with you presently .
MARION: Thank you .
MAJOR HALBERT: You may , of course , keep you weapons , but I must warn you that
MARION: I 'm familiar with appropriate ehavior at a military parley .
MAJOR HALBERT: Yes , quite , but you should know that
MARION: That will be all , Major . I 'll wait for Lord Cornwallis .
MAJOR HALBERT: Yes you will wait . Major Halbert turns and starts to stride out .
MARION: One other thing . Major Halbert stops .
CORNWALLIS: Jupiter ! Mars !
MARION: Go .
CORNWALLIS: My boys my boys you seem to have been well fed . Thank you fo that , Colonel .
MARION: My pleasure , sir .
CORNWALLIS: Please forgive me for keeping you waiting .
MARION: Apology accepted .
CORNWALLIS: Thank you , Colonel I 'm afraid I do n't know your name .
MARION: Colonel will do .
CORNWALLIS: As you wish .
TARLETON: Colonel .
MARION: Shall we proceed ?
CORNWALLIS: Let us . Unless you object , I would like to deem this meeting a formal negotiation and , as such , there are certain customary practices . Perhaps I could explain them to you
MARION: I 'm familiar with how a formal negotiation is handled .
CORNWALLIS: Oh ?
MARION: I served in His Majesty 's army in the French and Indian War .
CORNWALLIS: Oh . Very well , then . Would you , as the initiating party , like to begin ?
MARION: Unless you would like to claim aggrieved status .
CORNWALLIS: You are familiar with how these things are done . In fact , I would like to claim aggrieved status .
MARION: Very well , proceed , sir .
CORNWALLIS: First , you have in your possession certain belongings of mine , including clothing , private papers , furniture and personal effects of a non-military nature which I would like to have returned to me .
MARION: I will do so as soon as possible . Cornwallis is surprised .
CORNWALLIS: Thank you .
MARION: Please accept my apology for not having done so sooner .
CORNWALLIS: Apology accepted . Now , on the matter of the specific targeting of officers during engagements , this is absolutely unacceptable .
MARION: That one is a bit more difficult .
CORNWALLIS: Certainly you must know that in civilized warfare , officers in the field must not be accorded inappropriate levels of hostile attention .
MARION: And what are inappropriate levels of hostile attention ?
CORNWALLIS: Colonel , imagine the utter chaos that would result from un-led armies having at each other . There must be gentlemen in command to lead and , when appropriate , restrain thei men .
MARION: Restrain them from the targeting of civilians , including women and children ?
CORNWALLIS: That is a separate issue .
MARION: I consider them linked .
CORNWALLIS: I beg to differ . One is a command decision on your part . The othe epresents nothing more than the occasional over-exuberance of field officers attempting to carry out their duty in difficult circumstances .
MARION: As long as your soldiers attack civilians , I will order the shooting of your officers at the outset of every engagement . And my men are excellent marksmen . Cornwallis sighs .
CORNWALLIS: Very well , let us move on to
MARION: Prisoner exchange .
CORNWALLIS: Sir ?
MARION: You have eighteen of my men . I want them back .
CORNWALLIS: I do have eighteen criminals unde sentence of death , but I hold no prisoners-of-war .
MARION: If that 's your position , then eighteen of your officers will die . Nineteen , if you hang me with my men .
CORNWALLIS: What officers ?
MARION: In the clearing , just down from the crest , to the left of the dark pines Cornwallis looks through the spyglass .
CORNWALLIS: Their names , ranks and posts ?
MARION: They refused to give me their names . Their ranks are nine lieutenants , five captains , three majors and one fat colonel who called me a cheeky fellow . Their posts ? We picked them up here-and-there last night . Cornwallis glares at Marion .
CORNWALLIS: You are not a gentleman . Marion ca n't help but laugh at the insult .
MARION: If your conduct is the measure of a gentleman , I take that as a compliment . Get my men . Cornwallis turns to Colonel Huntington .
CORNWALLIS: Arrange the exchange . Colonel Huntington leaves to do so .
MARION: Thank you , General . I 'm sure you officers will thank you , as well .
TARLETON: Ah , yes , that boy . Tarleton calmly holds Marion 's glare .
MARION: Yes , ugly business .
CORNWALLIS: Jupiter ! Mars !
TARLETON: Take a detachment and go get ou officers . Wilkins hurries off .
CORNWALLIS: This fox believes himself clever . We shall see .
GASKINS: Nothing .
WILKINS: No one 's been here for months .
TARLETON: But now we have a name for ou Colonel Francis Marion . And with a name will come a family .
CAPTAIN MORROW: UPSTAIRS !
TARLETON: They ca n't be far . Check the outbuildings and the woods . The Dragoons race outside .
GABRIEL: It 's all set .
CHARLOTTE: This will do fine . She turns to Aaron and Abigail .
GABRIEL: Yes .
CHARLOTTE: I thought it might be him , the bits and pieces we heard , a veteran , fought in the French and Indian War , knows the swamps .
GABRIEL: They wo n't stop looking for you and the children .
CHARLOTTE: We 'll be alright , here , for now . How is he ? Gabriel searches for an honest answer .
GABRIEL: I do n't know I 'm his son .
SUSAN: Why did n't father come ?
CHARLOTTE: Speaking for months now .
SUSAN: Why did n't he come ?
GABRIEL: He wanted to , Susan , but he could n't leave his men .
SUSAN: He left us .
GABRIEL: I know he did and he 's sorry . He 'll come back as soon as he can .
SUSAN: I do n't care . I hate him .
GABRIEL: You do n't hate him .
SUSAN: Yes , I do . I hate him and I hope he never comes back .
MARION: She spoke ? Susan spoke ?
GABRIEL: Full sentences . As if she had been speaking all along .
MARION: I do n't believe it and I was n't there for it The cloud passes quickly .
GABRIEL: She said she loves you and misses you but she understands why you ca n't be there with her .
MARION: She said that ? Oh , my Lord , she said that ? Gabriel nods .
GABRIEL: Father , there 's something else I need to talk to you about .
MARION: What ?
GABRIEL: Come with me . I 'll tell you when we get there . Marion nods and curiously follows Gabriel .
MARION: I 'd be honored .
REV. OLIVER: Dearly beloved , we are gathered here in the sight of God to join this man and this woman in holy matrimony
GABRIEL: Sir , I 'd like to request a furlough . Two days ?
MARION: Granted . Where are you going ?
GABRIEL: Cheraw Falls .
MARION: It 's beautiful there . Your mothe and I were there once , before you were born .
GABRIEL: I know . They 're silent for a moment .
MARION: She would have been pleased .
ANNE: I 'm sorry we did n't give you more warning .
MARION: It 's alright . I 'm very happy fo you .
REV. OLIVER: For richer , for poorer , in sickness and in health , 'til death do they part . Marion nods . They ride on .
CORNWALLIS: From General Clinton in New York `` your request to move north is denied until you have properly dealt with your militia problem . '' He underlined , 'militia ' . `` You have spent over six months dealing with a six-week problem . It is essential that you quell the militia '' Underlined again. `` insurgency , particularly ecause of the likely move south of Washington and the inevitable arrival of the French . Militia , as you have so often pointed out , is not worth the attention of a significant army , hence it is mystifying why militia has bedeviled you for so long '' Tarleton smiles slightly , enjoying the show .
TARLETON: Perhaps .
CORNWALLIS: And if I triumph , you triumph .
TARLETON: Probably .
CORNWALLIS: How can we end this madness ?
TARLETON: Difficult , sir . This is , as you pointed out , a civil war .
CORNWALLIS: Civility is a secondary virtue . It is superseded by duty .
TARLETON: I understand , sir .
GASKINS: I 'm sorry , sir . He died . Tarleton sighs , irritated .
TARLETON: Very well , get one of the others .
BILLINGS: Damn your eyes . Do your worst .
TARLETON: I intend to . They tie Billings to the table .
DALTON: You still want me to give wounded Redcoats quarter ?
GABRIEL: Tarleton has a list of our men , most are on it . A regiment of dragoons is going to the homes on the list , urning them , killing whomeve esists , women and children , as well .
MARION: Where ?
GABRIEL: Seven homes along the Black River so far
REV. OLIVER: It 's not time for vengeance , it 's time to mourn and
MARION: Five day furlough for all men . Abner , Dan , Reverend , spread the word . We 'll reform at Acworth . Any man who does n't come back wo n't be thought a coward or uncommitted to the cause . Attend to your families .
NATHAN: Father !
WILLIAM: Papa
MARION: Thank you .
MARGARET: I told you , things would get better . The children smile and dismount .
MARION: The overlook , up there should be where you post the watch . Work out a schedule . Short watches , especially at night . If you can catch some of those mockingbirds you can make cages and put them along there for alarms . Now let 's find someplace to cache extra weapons They follow Marion like soldiers .
ANNE: May I ask you a question ?
MARION: Yes , of course . She speaks with a sly , withheld smile .
ANNE: Do you think Frances with an `` e '' is too manly a name for a girl ?
MARION: No .
ANNE: Do you think Francis with an `` i '' is too womanly a name for a boy ?
MARION: No .
ANNE: Good .
MARION: When ?
ANNE: Late summer .
MARION: Congratulations .
ANNE: Thank you . Marion laughs at the thought .
CHARLOTTE: I 'm not my sister . Startled , Marion turns to Charlotte .
MARION: Excuse me ?
CHARLOTTE: I said , I 'm not my sister .
MARION: I know that .
CHARLOTTE: Do you ?
MARION: Of course , I do .
CHARLOTTE: Very well , then .
MARION: Just a little goodbye ? One word ? That 's all I want to hear .
CHARLOTTE: Goodbye .
SUSAN: Papa !
MARION: I 'll come back I promise
REV. OLIVER: About a hundred and twenty . Less than a third .
REDCOAT SERGEANT: Excuse me , Ma'am , everyone has been equested to gather at the church .
ANNE: Everyone ?
REDCOAT SERGEANT: Colonel Tarleton wants to address , the whole village .
REDCOAT: Into the church , please .
ANOTHER REDCOAT: Colonel Tarleton wishes to address all of you .
VOICE: Open this door !
ANOTHER VOICE: By what right are we made prisoners ?
WILKINS: Sir ?
TARLETON: Yes , Major .
WILKINS: Sir , there is no honor in this .
TARLETON: The honor is found in the end , not the means . This will be forgotten . Proceed .
GABRIEL: Anne ?
MARION: Do n't go in there .
GABRIEL: Is it her ? Is Anne in there ?
MARION: She is . Do n't go in there .
GABRIEL: Father , tell me what happened at Fort Wilderness ?
MARION: You know what happened .
GABRIEL: No , I do n't .
MARION: Everyone knows . It 's what made me a hero . Me , Harry Lee , all of us . I got a medal . Men bought me drinks . They still do sometimes . Everyone knows what happened .
GABRIEL: Tell me what everyone does n't know .
MARION: And what do they know ?
GABRIEL: That the French and Cherokees captured the fort and when you etook it , you took revenge on them for what they did during the occupation .
MARION: That 's right .
GABRIEL: That 's not enough . Tell me .
MARION: Your mother asked me the same question around the time you were orn . I was drunk and I was foolish enough to answer her . Marion shakes his head to himself .
GABRIEL: I 'm not my mother . I ca n't have the espect without the knowing . Marion 's quiet for a moment . Then he speaks
MARION: It was in '63 . It was a bad time . The French and the Cherokee had aided along the Blue Ridge . All the English settlers took refuge at Fort Wilderness but the French captured it . We were sent in elief . Harry Lee , Billings , sixty of us . We already had something of a reputation for being harsh . When we got there the fort was abandoned . Not a French soldier o Cherokee anywhere . They had left a week earlier . What we found was ad .
GABRIEL: Go on .
MARION: We took our time with them and gave every one of them worse than they had given at the fort . It was two weeks before they were all dead , all except two . We put the heads on a pallet and had the two we let live take it to the French at Fort Ambercon . The eyes , fingers and tongues we put in a basket and sent that down the Asheulot to the Cherokee . The French stayed east of the Blue Ridge after that and the Cherokee oke their treaty with the French and stayed out of the fight . That seemed to make a difference . The war went another year , things went better and men bought us drinks .
GABRIEL: I see , do as I say , not as I do .
MARION: Yes .
ABNER: THEY 'RE HERE ! CONTINENTALS , THEY 'RE HERE !
MARION: If this war is about more than Thomas , it 's about more than Anne , as well . Stay the course .
GABRIEL: As you did at Fort Wilderness ?
LEE: Look at you ! I knew you could do it !
MARION: His wife was killed yesterday . She was with child .
LEE: I 'm sorry , I did n't know .
DALTON: Gabriel and at least a dozen others . They must have left right after the watch change .
MARION: That means they have two hours on us .
BROTHER JOSEPH: Fifty Green Dragoons , camped about a quarter mile from here . Sentries at four points .
WILKINS: FIRE !
GABRIEL: I 'm alright , I He tries to stand
MARION: Let me help you
DALTON: Colonel
REV. OLIVER: May I help you try to find solace with the word of God ? No response .
MARION: He looks as if he 's sleeping , does n't he ?
REV. OLIVER: Yes , he does .
LEE: You have to bury him . No response .
MARION: Do n't touch him .
LEE: How many men have we seen die ?
MARION: Two . Gabriel and Thomas .
LEE: They 're gone . And there is nothing you or I can do to bring them back . But there is something you can do to help end all this .
MARION: It is ended .
LEE: No . It 's not over yet . Two days ide , Yorktown , Virginia . Washington , the French , Cornwallis and Tarleton . It will end , one way or another . Francis , nothing will replace you sons but helping us will justify their sacrifice .
RUNNER: You called for me , sir ?
MARION: Take this to General Washington .
WASHINGTON: Did you bring me this ?
RUNNER: Yes , sir .
WASHINGTON: Take this to Colonel Marion .
RUNNER: Yes , sir . The boy runs off . Washington smiles .
MARION: Colonel Francis Marion .
WASHINGTON: Earned .
MARION: I lost another a year ago , Thomas . He was only fifteen .
WASHINGTON: I 've had no sons to lose , no daughters . I lose the sons of other men .
HAMILTON: Mortars , center , with two lines of enfilading trenches .
PINKNEY: More along the right flank and ehind the forward redoubts .
LAFAYETTE: A formidable defensive position . Very formidable .
HAMILTON: They could hold out for weeks . Washington nods and turns to Marion .
WASHINGTON: Francis , tell me about General Cornwallis .
MARION: Remember Braddock ?
WASHINGTON: That bad ?
MARION: Worse .
WASHINGTON: Proud , priggish and competent . A very bad combination in an adversary . Washington sighs .
HAMILTON: How long before they arrive ?
WASHINGTON: Less than a week . Sixteen ships and over nine thousand Redcoats .
LAFAYETTE: Sooner or later that message will get through to Cornwallis .
PINKNEY: And when it does , he 'll just wait us out .
WASHINGTON: And when the British ships arrive , the French ships will flee . And when the French ships flee , General Rochambeau and the French troops will flee as well . Marion speaks up .
MARION: Then you must let the message go through .
WASHINGTON: If Cornwallis receives news that Clinton is coming , he 'll simply hold tight and wait . He 'll fight a purely defensive battle and he 'll win that .
MARION: No , he wo n't . There are two things you need to know about Cornwallis . First , he is a very proud man , He would rather risk defeat than share a victory . If you give him what he thinks is an out , he 'll take it .
WASHINGTON: And what is the second thing ?
MARION: I 'll let him tell you himself `` but it is this colonial militia that is the most irksome . Not worthy of my attention , but demanding it ; not worthy of British lood , but taking it ; and not worthy of a soldier 's honor , but sullying it . Those nights of mine that are not sleepless , are filled with dreams of a cavalry charge on the heels of fleeing farmers '' Marion closes the journal .
MAJOR HALBERT: Sir , a dispatch from General Clinton made it through the rebel lines .
WILKINS: Sir ?
CORNWALLIS: Call a general staff meeting .
AIDE: Yes , sir .
MARION: The British army believes in officers . I believe in soldiers . After we engage , there will be no more orders . Every man here must know what I 'm about to tell you . They listen closely .
CORNWALLIS: Do you see that , Colonel ?
TARLETON: Unless I 'm dreaming , I think I see irregulars at their center .
CORNWALLIS: Fix bayonets dispatch the Green Dragoons .
DALTON: COLONEL ! OUR LINE !
LEE: Goodbye , Francis .
MARION: Goodbye , Harry . Marion reaches down . They shake hands .
LEE: Thank you . Maybe all of this will uy him some peace .
MARION: I hope so .
LEE: Robert . Robert E. Lee . Marion smiles .
MARION: A good name for a farmer . Lee nods . Marion rides off .
CHARLOTTE: Lovely .
SUSAN: Wait for me
GIRL: Go on now Paul , do n't be long .

CLIVE: No , it 's rubbish .
GRAHAM: What are you going to ask ?

GRAHAM: Would you like a copy ?
PUBLICIST: Are you nuts ? My office is full of junk . The PUBLICIST walks away chuckling .
CLIVE: Graham , I need a drink .

GRAHAM: And let 's not forget , we 've always got Analogue .
CLIVE: Not when we 're driving Graham .
GRAHAM: Sorry .
CLIVE: Thank god . I 'm a wreck until I 've had my first cup of J .

CLIVE: Amazing , is n't it ? There are 295,734,134 people in this country and we have n't seen a soul for a hundred miles . Where is everybody ?
GRAHAM: What about that old woman on crutches we saw hitchhiking ?
CLIVE: Apart from her . I suppose that 's why they established the Dreamland facility out here .
GRAHAM: Far from prying eyes .
CLIVE: Did you know the site was selected in the mid-1950s for testing of the U-2 spyplane , due to its emoteness , proximity to existing facilities and presence of a dry lake bad for landings ?
GRAHAM: Yes .
CLIVE: Oh .
GRAHAM: Shall we have a bite before o after we hit the Black Mailbox ?
CLIVE: Before .
PAT: `` Watch The Skies '' � or `` Alien Onboard ? `` �
MUMBLY: San Diego .

PAT: Well , I do n't know what they were . So as far as I 'm concerned they 're unidentified and they were definitely flying .
CLIVE: And objects .
PAT: Damn straight . Whether or not they were spaceships , I ca n't say . Probably not , but I 'd like to think they were . Be a shame if we were the only souls in the universe .
CLIVE: Did you now , it 's estimated that there are as many as 200 billion galaxies in the observable universe and each of those has approximately 40 billion starts , around which orbit countless planets and moons ?

PAT: Okay then , beers for you gentleman . A cup of Joe and a extra thick malt with a sparkler for the boys from outer space .
JAKE: We 're heading into Utah . Do ourselves some hunting .
GUS: Deer , coon , beaver , whatever steps in front of the bangstick , right Jake ? They throw a look back at GRAHAM and CLIVE .
JAKE: You got that right , Gus .
PAT: Well now , I heard Utah beaver puts up quite a fight .
GUS: That 's what we 're counting on . They nudge each other and laugh .
PAT: I better make you something good and hot . Long way to The Beehive .
CLIVE: What took you so long ?
GRAHAM: I was putting the sticker on .
CLIVE: They were an odd pair , were n't they ?
GRAHAM: Definitely did n't speak Bocci .
CLIVE: No .
GRAHAM: What 's the matter ?
CLIVE: Nothing . How we doing ?
GRAHAM: We should be just about there . They scan the roadside for a few seconds .
CLIVE: I 've found it .
GRAHAM: Where ?
REVERENTIALLY: The Black Mailbox .
CLIVE: It 's amazing , is n't it ? We 're actually here .
GRAHAM: Area 51 .
CLIVE: Dreamland .
GRAHAM: The Groom Lake Military Test Facility .
CLIVE: MacArthur 's Black Mile .
GRAHAM: Is that a real one ?
CLIVE: No , I made it up myself .
GRAHAM: I like it .
CLIVE: Be great if we saw something .
GRAHAM: Yes , imagine if we got buzzed up by a craft .
CLIVE: That would be incredible . It just sort of stops in the air and hovers then just goes up really fast . Whoosh .
GRAHAM: What would you do if they actually landed ?
CLIVE: Keep it together . First contact is a big responsibility . They come in peace , we go to pieces ? That 's not how I roll .
GRAHAM: It 's them . They found us . I do n't know how but they found us .
CLIVE: Who ? Who 's found us ?
GRAHAM: The Libyans !
CLIVE: Run for it Marty ! GRAHAM and CLIVE scramble for the RV .
GRAHAM: Perhaps it 's not them . Perhaps whoever it was turned doff .
CLIVE: Of course it 's them . We 're dead . It 's like Deliverance . They 're going to rape us and break ou arms .
GRAHAM: I do n't want my arms broken !
CLIVE: There 's only one thing for it .
GRAHAM: What ?
CLIVE: I 'm gon na have to fly blind .
GRAHAM: I need the toilet .
CLIVE: Me too . The vehicle behind pulls out to overtake .
GRAHAM: Do n't let them get past .
CLIVE: Should I ram them ?
GRAHAM: What about the deposit ?
CLIVE: It was n't them .
GRAHAM: I still need a wee .
CLIVE: I can hold mine .
GRAHAM: The bulb 's gone in there .
CLIVE: Hello ? They wait for a few seconds . Nothing .
GRAHAM: Maybe you should call for help .
CLIVE: I rather think these men need help . Graham , give me the phone . GRAHAM passes the phone over .
VOICE: Seriously , I would n't do that .
OPERATOR: 911 Emergency . How may I direct your call ? Hello ? Hello ?
ALIEN: Put - the phone - down .
GRAHAM: What have you done to him ?
ALIEN: I did n't do anything . He fainted .
GRAHAM: Yes but you made him faint .
ALIEN: I did not . Okay I did , but it 's not like i set my phaser to `` ˜Faint ' .
GRAHAM: You 've got a phaser ! ?
ALIEN: No ! Look , I need you to help . Can you get this guy back onto you wagon ?
GRAHAM: Are you going to probe us ?
ALIEN: No ! Where does that come from ? Why do people always assume we want to stick something up their ass ?
GRAHAM: Do n't you ?
ALIEN: No . There 's certainly nothing about it in the encounter manual . As a ule , we do n't even abduct . Maybe people find it easier to deal with earthly transgressions if they suppress it with absurd fantasies about alien probing .
GRAHAM: What ?
ALIEN: It 's just a theory . Listen , focus okay ? I promise you I wo n't hurt you , I just need your help .
GRAHAM: You need my help ?
ALIEN: Yes .
GRAHAM: How come I can understand you ? Are you using some sort of neural language router ?
ALIEN: No , I 'm speaking English you prick . Sorry , I 'm tense . Look , what 's you name ?
GRAHAM: Graham Willy .
ALIEN: What about him ?
GRAHAM: That 's the writer , Clive Gollings .
ALIEN: Well , let 's get Clive into the RV and get going . I 'll explain everything on the way . Please .
GRAHAM: Where are we going ?
ALIEN: North .
GRAHAM: The RV 's got ta be back in 2 days .
ALIEN: Well , then we 're gon na have to hustle , are n't we ?
ALIEN: Look Graham , you 're just gon na have to trust me , okay ?
GRAHAM: Okay then .
ALIEN: Great . Thank you .
GRAHAM: What 's your name ?
ALIEN: I 'm Paul .
GRAHAM: Paul ?
PAUL: Yeah . Now let 's get Cloverfield onto the recreational vehicle and get the fuck off MacArthur 's Black Mile .
GRAHAM: I told him he should have gone .
PAUL: Could have been worse . Know what I 'm saying ?
GRAHAM: Uh yes .
PAUL: Great !
GRAHAM: Paul ? Where am I going again ?
PAUL: I told you , North . Do you have a map ?
GRAHAM: Sorry .
PAUL: Just head North . We need to get as much distance as we can between us and them .
GRAHAM: Them ? Who 's them ?
CAPTAIN: Sir ?
ZOIL: Talk to me .
CAPTAIN: Three survivors , company men , hurt ut alive .
ZOIL: Anyone else ?
CAPTAIN: No sir .
ZOIL: No . It 's neither of those things .
VOICE: What 's the situation ?
ZOIL: We have a guest who 's left the hotel without paying , sir .
VOICE: Damn it ! Do you think he 's `` ˜left ' left ?
ZOIL: Doubtful . NORAD would have picked up a bogie . Those guys can track Santa . No sir , he 's still here . Question is , for how long ?
VOICE: Do n't you think this is all a bit of a coincidence ?
ZOIL: How so ?
VOICE: I signed the red document this morning , Zoil . Do n't you think it 's odd that he chooses today to go AWOL ? How did he know ?
ZOIL: Are you suggesting he has someone on the inside .
VOICE: Maybe .
ZOIL: Well he 's definitely got someone on the outside .
VOICE: What ?
ZOIL: Tire tracks , sir . Tire tracks among other things . I 'd bet my left nut that little bastard 's hitched a ide .
VOICE: Lock down the area . Road blocks , spot checks , the whole nine yards . You 're going to handle this personally , Zoil . I want this wrapped up before Letterman .
PAUL: The bulb 's gone in there .
GRAHAM: I usually bite them open .
PAUL: Are you fucking insane ? You got ta tap `` ˜em and if they do n't open you throw them away .
GRAHAM: That 's molluscs .
PAUL: Shut up .
GRAHAM: It 's true .
NOTICES CLIVE: Hello Clive ! How are you feeling ?
CLIVE: I 'm feeling like I 've gone MENTAL MAD , Graham . If that is your name ? You 're happily sitting there chatting to to that , like it 's the most natural thing in the world . The two of you laughing away like you have n't seen each othe since 1990 . PAUL spits a shell out into a cup .
GRAHAM: His name is Paul .
CLIVE: Oh , Paul is it ? Paul what ? Paul Verhoven ? Paul Freeman ? Paul Reiser ?
PAUL: Just Paul . You know , like Madonna or Dracula .
GRAHAM: Paul 's from a small planet in the northern spiral arm of the Andromeda Galaxy .
CLIVE: No he is not !
PAUL: I am man , seriously .
CLIVE: How could he possibly have travelled that distance ?
PAUL: Wormhole .
CLIVE: Balls ! Graham , this is n't what it seems . What about Ocham 's Razor ?
GRAHAM: The hairdressers ?
CLIVE: Yes , the old man who owns it told me that , in unbelievable circumstances , the most plausible explanation is usually the truth .
PAUL: And what 's the most plausible explanation , Clive ?
CLIVE: That you 're a thin midget in an alien costume .
PAUL: There 's no such thing as a thin midget ? Those guys are built . Have you not seen The Station Agent ?
GRAHAM: He 's right . I think that 's less elievable than Paul being form a planet in the norther spiral arm of the Andromeda Galaxy .
PAUL: Ow ! Get off me !
CLIVE: You 're not real . You 're not real !
GRAHAM: Excuse me .
PAUL: Get off me , you fucking psycho !
CLIVE: Oh shit !
GRAHAM: Maybe he beamed up .
CLIVE: As if . We would have seen the classic shimmer and hum .
GRAHAM: Good point .
AGENT 1: Where you boys from ? Australia ?
CLIVE: Britain .
AGENT 1: Ah . G'day mate .
CLIVE: We were having a little drive .
AGENT 1: Is that right ?
HAGGARD: Yeah ?
O'REILLY: These guys have met Michael Biehn .
HAGGARD: No shit ! How was he ?
CLIVE: He was a good egg .
GRAHAM: Very unaffected .
HAGGARD: That 's nice to hear .
O'REILLY: Just some pissy jeans .
HAGGARD: Okay , you guys can go .
CLIVE: Thank you . May I ask what you 're searching for ?
HAGGARD: Of course you may .
CLIVE: Well , it 's pretty obvious what happened there , is n't it ?
GRAHAM: Is it ?
CLIVE: Yes , the government used some sort of neurotoxic paint on the Black Mailbox , which was white by the way , and it caused us to suffer a shared hallucination about an alien . I mean , it 's what we 've always wanted , is n't it ?
GRAHAM: I suppose so .
CLIVE: Than that 's what happened . PAUL materializes from thin air behind them .
CLIVE: Where the hell did you go ?
PAUL: Nowhere .
GRAHAM: What , you went invisible ?
PAUL: It 's not invisibility per so . It 's more like what a chameleon does with a little light blending thrown in for good measure .
GRAHAM: Like Predator ?
PAUL: Exactly .
GRAHAM: Can you do it whenever you want ?
PREDATOR VOICE: Anytime
CLIVE: No thank you .
PAUL: You sure ? How about a cup of coffee ? Come on Hulk , I 'll get you a nice cuppa J .
GRAHAM: Hello Paul . GRAHAM approaches CLIVE who ignores him .
CLIVE: Graham , there is a Grey in the galley , making me coffee .
GRAHAM: Did you want tea ?
CLIVE: No , I do n't want tea .
GRAHAM: Tea 's a bit weird in America , is n't it ?
CLIVE: No , what 's wried , Graham , is that we have picked up an extra terrestrial hitch hiker and you seem completely fine with it !
GRAHAM: He needs our help , Clive .
PAUL CLIVE: You got it ? Yes I 've got it .
PAUL: Look Clive , I 'm gon na go out on a limb and say this is probably the weirdest thing that 's ever happened to you . Am i right ? CLIVE does n't deny it .
CLIVE: Why us ?
PAUL: Why not ? CLIVE glances back at an expectant GRAHAM .
CLIVE: What about the RV ? It has to be ack in two days .
GRAHAM: Clive , he 's an alien . A living , eathing , alien .
CLIVE: I suppose we could phone the hire company and get an extension . PAUL looks super-pleased .
PAUL: Crashed in `` ˜47 . Anti-grav failure .
GRAHAM: Happens to the best of us .
PAUL: Also , I 'm a shit driver .
CLIVE: Oh my God ! Roswell ? ! That was you ? !
PAUL: Roswell was a smoke-screen man , designed to distract from the truth .
CLIVE: They invented a fake alien crash to distract from an actual alien crash ?
PAUL: I know , fucking stupid , is n't it ?
CLIVE: What have you been doing here all this time ?
PAUL: Oh you know , kickin ' back , shooting the shit . Advising the government .
GRAHAM: Not just the government .
STEVEN SPIELBERG: I want him to have some kind of special power , you know ? Something sort of messianic
PAUL: How about molecular revivification .
STEVEN SPIELBERG: I do n't know what that is .
PAUL: Restoration of damaged tissue through telepathic manipulation of cellular intrinsic field memory .
STEVEN SPIELBERG: Iuh
PAUL: Healing , Steven .
STEVEN SPIELBERG: Oh right yeah . Like by touch sort of thing ? His little finger could light up at the end and-
PAUL: You know what ? Sometimes , less is more . The line beeps .
STEVEN SPIELBERG: You got another call ?
PAUL: Yeah I got ta take this man . It 's the fucking V guys again .
GRAHAM: You 'd be surprised how much he 's influenced popular culture generally over the last 60 years .
TO GRAHAM: How come you know so much ?
GRAHAM: We had quite a long chat while you were unconscious . CLIVE looks miffed .
PAUL: You want a bagel Clive ?
CLIVE: No thanks .
PAUL: Graham ?
GRAHAM: Yes please .
CLIVE: Go on then , I 'll have half .
PAUL: Gotcha .
GRAHAM: I gave your jeans a swill and hung them up .
CLIVE: Thank you . So , do you know where we 're going ?
GRAHAM: Just North . He said we had to make a right at Utah .
CLIVE: Why ca n't he tell us ?
GRAHAM: He said it was a surprise .
CLIVE: Do you trust him , Graham ? I mean , is he Strider or Black Rider ?
GRAHAM: Strider , definitely .
CLIVE: You 'd better be right . I do n't want to wake up and find him inserting a probe into my anus .
GRAHAM: It 's okay , he does n't do that .
PAUL: Bagel time !
GRAHAM: Fuel level 's critical .
PAUL: Sorry , I had a warning light just like that on my ship .
GRAHAM: For fuel ?
PAUL: Anti-grav failure .
CLIVE: There 's a place called Ely five miles from here . It 's small but there should be a gas station .
GRAHAM: Roger that , number one .
CLIVE: Paul , do n't do that !
PAUL: Here 's what I need . Some organic eef mince , organic pork , some veal , red onions , pine nuts , pecorino cheese , plum tomatoes , a fistful of fresh basil and 3 wa ciabattas .
CLIVE: You know this is a gas station ? PAUL looks disappointed .
GRAHAM: Ready . HOOOONNNNNKKKK ! GRAHAM and CLIVE jump .
STATE TROOPER: After you .
CLIVE: Thanks .
O'REILLY: Coming ready or not !
ZOIL: Orange ?
O'REILLY: No thanks .
ZOIL: Nice and juicy .
O'REILLY: I do n't want to spoil breakfast .
ZOIL: Do you mind telling me what 's going on , Agent ?
O'REILLY: Just keeping ourselves occupied sir . Things are pretty slow .
ZOIL: Where 's the other one ?
O'REILLY: I do n't know , let 's see . Haggard ?
HAGGARD: Sorry , I was just hiding .
ZOIL: I see . You fellas had much traffic through here ?
HAGGARD: Just a big RV driven by a couple of nerds .
ZOIL: Nerds , huh ?
HAGGARD: Yeah , they 'd been to Comic-Con and met Michael Biehn .
ZOIL: I 've heard he 's nice .
HAGGARD: Good egg .
O'REILLY: Very unaffected .
ZOIL: Did you search the vehicle thoroughly ?
O'REILLY: Yes sir .
ZOIL: Find anything ?
O'REILLY: Not really . Just Michael Biehn 's autograph and some pissy jeans .
ZOIL: Did you get the license plate ? HAGGARD and O'REILLY look sheepish .
HAGGARD: It was big .
ZOIL: I want everything you can remember . Descriptions of the occupants , height , hair , distinguishing features . We can do it on the way .
HAGGARD: On the way ?
ZOIL: You 're coming with me .
O'REILLY: What about the road block sir ?
ZOIL: It did n't work .
CLIVE: Do n't you think that 's a bit much ? Put it all back . Except the urrito and the doughnuts and the chocolate milk . Let 's just pay for it and leave .
GRAHAM: We need bulb for the toilet .
CLIVE: Essential only , Graham !
STATE TROOPER: Morning Chris !
CHRIS: Hey Dean .
STATE TROOPER: Who do you think I had in my office this morning ?
CHRIS: Jeremy Piven ?
STATE TROOPER: No . The Secret Service .
CHRIS: They find out how you can afford a Dodge Viper on troopers pay ?
STATE TROOPER: Not yet . They 're all over this crash on the road up to Rachel .
CHRIS: What you think 's going on ?
STATE TROOPER: Do n't know , could be Muslims .
CHRIS: Jesus Cheeerist ! CLIVE and GRAHAM sidle up to the check-out .
STATE TROOPER: You go right ahead .
CLIVE: Thank you very much , officer .
STATE TROOPER: Where 're you guys from ?
GRAHAM: Britain .
STATE TROOPER: Britain , huh ? Nice place . No guns !
CHRIS: No guns ? Jesus Cheeerist .
POLICE CONTROLLER: All units , be on the lookout for a cream and brown Recreational Vehicle , no plate number at this time . Officers are advised to contain but not board . Dean , if you still at Gas and Go , bring back a quart a milk and a box of doughnut holes ? Dean ?
CLIVE: It 's find for you . You 'll get whisked back to whatever lab they kept you in and we 'll be arrested for harbouring a fugitive and sent to Guantanamo Bay . PAUL laughs .
PAUL: That 's their excuse for everything . There are worse things you can be . We had a Muslim guy at the base . Systems analyst called Yusef . We used to do karaoke on Tuesday nights . You should ' a heard him do Matthew and Son . Shame I did n't get a chance to say salam alaikum .
CLIVE: Paul , the authorities know we 're in an TV .
PAUL: We 're hardly the only RV on the oad . Trust me , if we stay off the highways , keep to the back routes , we 'll have a nice uneventful journey .
CLIVE: Ah yes , the waspish markings of a Scott 's Oriole . Unmistakable .
PAUL: What a waste .
GRAHAM: Poor thing .
CLIVE: Nothing anyone could 've done .
GRAHAM: What are you doing ?
PAUL: I 'll miss these .
CLIVE: Why would you do that ?
PAUL: I 'm not gon na eat a dead bird , am
STATE TROOPER: By the time I got the bulletin , they were long gone . Seemed like nice fellas to me .
CHRIS: Is it true they was Muslims ?
STATE TROOPER: They said they were British .
ZOIL: I think you can be both .
CHRIS: Jesus Cheeeeerist !
HAGGARD: Agent Zoil ?
ZOIL: Excuse me gentlemen .
VOICE: Report .
ZOIL: We 've tracked them down to a gas station in Ely .
VOICE: So why am I not witting with my feet up , smoking a jay , watching Erin Brockovich ?
ZOIL: We think he may be travelling in an RV with two British men sir .
VOICE: Goddamnit , I knew we should have gone ahead with invasion in `` ˜44 . What are they , MI6 ?
ZOIL: No , sir . Just a couple of nerds on the lamb from Comic-Con .
VOICE: Shit . My sister 's kid went to that . Little Manga faggot .
ZOIL: I still think this stinks , sir .
VOICE: Like fat man doo-doo . It 's too much of a coincidence . He sits tight fo 60 years and then suddenly now he decides to take off . If he wanted to go home so bad , he could 've just given us the slip when he was playing golf with J. Edgar Hoover .
ZOIL: Someone must have told him . We need to find the rat .
VOICE: Leave that to me . In the meantime , if E.T . is still M.I.A . in the P.M. then F.Y.I . I 'm tearing someone a new A . O.K . ?
ZOIL: Yes sir .
GRAHAM: What do you think ?
PAUL: Ask me when I 've finished it . CLIDE rubs his yes .
GRAHAM: You tired , Sausage ?
WHISPERING: Do n't call me Sausage in front of him .
GRAHAM: Sorry . Are you tired though ?
CLIVE: Mummy , I am bushed .
GRAHAM: What do you need ?
CLIVE: Best case , I 'd like a cold flannel on my neck and an honest meal .
GRAHAM: I hear that , Big-Rig . I can still call you Big-Rig ca n't I ?
CLIVE: Sure . Just not Sausage . Any luck with an RV park ? We need somewhere off the beaten track , n'est pas ?
GRAHAM: Roger that . Cup of Joe ?
CLIVE: You read my mind .
PAUL: You want a cigarette ?
CLIVE: No , thank you . I do n't smoke .
PAUL: Look , I 'm sorry okay ? About eating the bird .
GRAHAM: Honey Bun ?
CLIVE: Could you unwrap it for me ?
GRAHAM: By your command .
PAUL: Let me ask you something . Are you to ?
CLIVE: What ?
PAUL: You know
CLIVE: No !
PAUL: Okay , that 's great . I just wondered . I 'm cool with it . Everyone 's `` ˜bi ' where I 'm from . It 's all about the pleasure thing , you know ? We 've evolved beyond paranoid notions of gende identity . I mean , procreation is only the functional aspect of sexual congress right ? The human ace is fairly advanced but most males still act like a cornered tiger if you imply the like `` ˜smoking the bone ' and let 's face it they probably do . Look at single sex , empirical institutions , oarding schools , prisons , pirate ships , places where the choice has een removed , everyone 's banging everyone else and there is n't a whiff of socio-cultural angst . Get out into the real world and guys are getting smacked int he chops for wearing pink socks . You think you 're so sophisticated because you can distinguish yourself from you own reflection but ultimately you 're part of a deeply neurotic species and you 'd all be a lot etter off if you stopped worrying and learned to love the bum .
CLIVE: What are you trying to say ?
PAUL: Maybe you should start smoking .
CLIVE: Great find , Graham .
GRAHAM: I sourced a website listing off the eaten track , North American RV parks .
PAUL: I really lucked out with you nerds , did n't I ?
GRAHAM: It 's awfully quiet .
CLIVE: Just the way we like it .
GRAHAM: Someone 's coming .
VOICE: Hello ?
CLIVE: We 're just a couple of regular guys on a tour of the less touristy side of the American midwest .
GRAHAM: I do n't think she heard you .
CLIVE: I was talking to you .
GRAHAM: Oh , sorry .
VOICE: Hello ?
RUTH: Good evening , I 'm Ruth Behe .
CLIVE: Hello Ruth . Do you mind if we come in ?
RUTH: Sure . Park in Bay 9 . The charge is $ 50 for the night , plus $ 10 fo hook ups an I 'll need to hang onto an ID too .
GRAHAM: We 're just a couple of regular guys on tour of the less touristy side of the American midwest .
RUTH: Where you heading next ?
GRAHAM: Uh , east apparently .
RUTH: England ?
CLIVE: Yes . London .
RUTH: I love London .
CLIVE: Have you been ?
RUTH: No . Did you know it was founded by the Romans in AD 43 as Londinium ?
GRAHAM: You should .
RUTH: There 's lots a places I wan na go . Europe . Asia . The Antipodes . The world 's a big place . I need one of these though .
CLIVE: You do n't have a passport ?
RUTH: That 's my father . I 'll come ove and take your money in the morning . Have a pleasant night now , wo n't you ?
CLIVE: Doors to manual and cross check . Graham ? Graham ?
GRAHAM: Hmmm ?
RUTH: I was just talking .
MOSES BEHE: Europe ? I 'll give you Europe , missy . Now , get and make my supper .
PAUL: Arrghh , what the fuck ? !
GRAHAM: Hungry ?
PAUL: I ate already . GRAHAM and CLIVE look suddenly sad .
GRAHAM: Willies ! PAUL gives CLIVE a `` ˜see what I mean ? ' look .
CLIVE: I 'll flame up the BBQ pit . Fire 's my forte .
PAUL: Hello Clive . From the squirting of the gas and the flicking of the tongue , am I do assume you 're a Hendrix fan ?
CLIVE: I am actually , yes .
PAUL: I met him once .
CLIVE: Really ?
PAUL: Yeah . Nice man , really soft , He thought I was a hallucination . Shame what happened to him .
CLIVE: All the good ones die .
PAUL: Meanwhile Bryan Adams releases album seventeen . PAUL and CLIVE share a laugh .
CLIVE: So you 've been here for 60 years ?
PAUL: I know , right ? Time flies when you 're confined to a U.S. military installation .
CLIVE: Why did you come to earth ?
PAUL: I 'm the vanguard of a highly aggressive invading force .
CLIVE: What ? !
PAUL: I 'm fucking with you , man . I was on a science mission actually . Meteorological reconnaissance . We were surveying atmospheric conditions on CO2 spiking , M-Class planets . My specialist subject is tornadoes right ? So I 'm buzzing around the mid-west , looking fo twisters and all of a sudden my A.G.G . goes offline and I crash in the middle of some field .
PAUL: No , it 's 52 . Area 51 is just full of old Pan Am jets and mini disc players and shit . It 's anothe `` clever subterfuge . `` � GRAHAM joins them with the food .
GRAHAM: Ha ha yeah .
PAUL: So , with my cover blown and the natives cautious but friendly , I figured we might as well indulge in a little file sharing .
CLIVE: Mulder was right !
PAUL: Mulder was my idea .
CLIVE: Would you like a go ?
RUTH: Good morning .
CLIVE: Good morning .
RUTH: May I come in ?
GRAHAM: Yes .
RUTH: Was everything to your liking ?
CLIVE: Yes , thank you .
RUTH: Where 's the other one ?
CLIVE: The other one ?
RUTH: It 's okay , we do n't charge by the person . That was three pairs of legs I saw last night cavorting ound the camp fire , right ?
CLIVE: Oh the other one . Um
PAUL: I 'm in the can . I ate a closed mollusc .
GRAHAM: I like your shirt .
RUTH: Thanks . I got it at my church .
GRAHAM: Why would Jesus want to shoot Charles Darwin ?
BRIGHTLY: Because of his theories . Are you men of God ?
GRAHAM: Would you like a coffee ?
CLIVE: I suppose we 're men of science .
CLIVE: If we believe in anything it would e macro evolution . Cause and effect . The establishment of a iological order from the maelstrom of physical and chemical chaos . RUTH looks scandalized .
GRAHAM: Or it could be God . You just do n't know do you ?
RUTH: God created the earth in six days and on the seventh he rested .
CLIVE: Did you know that the universe has een dated as being 13.5 billion years old an that the release of neutral hydrogen at the moment of the big bang has enabled scientists to do this with categorical accuracy ?
GRAHAM: Yes .
CLIVE: Not you !
RUTH: The world is 4000 years old .
RUTH: Explain to me how something as complicated as the human eye simply comes into being .
PAUL: Oh yeah ? Well then how do you explain me ?
CLIVE: What did you do that for ?
PAUL: I did n't do anything , she fainted .
CLIVE: She saw you !
PAUL: Oh come on . Who 's gon na believe anything she says ?
CLIVE: The authorities will be on the look out for exactly this sort of thing .
PAUL: What , a delusional , one-eyed God otherer ?
CLIVE: Paul , right now they 're going to follow any lead they can get .
PAUL: I did n't think of that .
GRAHAM: We could take her with us .
CLIVE: How am I going to get my passport ack ? PAUL vanishes .
PAUL: Hallelujah .
GRAHAM: Hi .
RUTH: Where am I ?
PAUL: Hey , look who 's up .
GRAHAM: Would you like a cup of tea ? RUTH starts to pray furiously .
RUTH: You have been deceived . Deceived by an agent of Satan himself .
GRAHAM: He 's not a demon Ruth , he 's from another world and we 're helping him get home . He 's not evil . He 's just very rude .
RUTH: How can he be from another world ? There is only one world . Our world , created by God the Father . PAUL sits down next to GRAHAM . RUTH whimpers .
PAUL: Look , if it makes you feel any etter , my existence only disproves the notion of the Abrahamic , Judeo- Christian God , as well as all single earth theologies . Science still has n't categorically rule out the notion of divinity , even though evolutionary biology suggest the non-existence of a creator by probability alone .
RUTH: How could that possibly make me feel any better ?
PAUL: Jesus Christ , I was just trying to e nice !
GRAHAM: I think what Paul 's trying to say is , just because there are othe inhabited planets , it 's not the end of the world .
RUTH: This is n't happening ! You 're a hallucination . You 're not real . You 're a test . A test from God .
PAUL: You ca n't win can you ?
CLIVE: I ca n't drive like this . We 'll have to drop her off and take ou chances .
GRAHAM: No !
PAUL: Oh , for God 's sake .
GRAHAM: What did you do to her ? !
PAUL: I broadened her horizons .
GRAHAM: Can you broaden mine ?
PAUL: No , it 's tiring . GRAHAM goes over to where PAUL is lying .
GRAHAM: Oh please .
PAUL: Come here then .
CLIVE: Oh great ! Everyone knows the secrets of the universe apart from me . He always knew what was going on in Buffy before me because his mum had cable .
PAUL: Ca n't I just tell you ?
CLIVE: No spoilers !
WEAKLY: Maybe I should make that tea ?
ZOIL: Given your description of the intruder , the police felt your call was perhaps better directed to us .
MOSES BEHE: And who are you ?
ZOIL: Secret Service , sir .
MOSES BEHE: I knew it . You know that devil took my Ruth .
ZOIL: And Ruth 's your daughter ?
MOSES BEHE: That 's right . Her Mama died when she was born . I good as brought he up by myself . Was n't easy either . Two mouths to feed and this place to run .
ZOIL: I understand . Do you have a photography of Ruth , Mr. Behe ?
MOSES BEHE: I do
ZOIL: You say they went East ?
MOSES BEHE: Uh-huh . They 'll have to get off the 191 after Flaming Gorge if they ai n't using the interstate , there 's een a rig spill just South of Dutch John .
ZOIL: So ?
MOSES BEHE: So that means they 'll be on the 44 . Only way to go . ZOIL looks at O'REILLY .
ZOIL: Let 's go . Haggard !
MOSES BEHE: Tell me you 're gon na kill that thing , Mr. Zoil . Kill it for what it is .
ZOIL: We 'll do our best , Mr. Behe .
MOSES BEHE: Watch yourself now . I seen its eyes . It 's evil .
ZOIL: Can it , you two ! How many times do I have to tell you ?
PAUL: Wow .
CLIVE: Is that where we 're going ?
PAUL: Maybe . I got ta tell ya . It 's at times like these you winder if the intelligent design crowd are n't onto something . I mean look at it . Hey Ruth , get up here .
CLIVE: Someone should go after her . Graham ? CLIVE looks round to see GRAHAM gone .
GRAHAM: Ruth !
RUTH: Leave me alone !
GRAHAM: Ruth , please stop , I 've got shin splints . RUTH stops . GRAHAM catches up to her .
RUTH: He ca n't be from space . It 's not possible .
GRAHAM: Ruth , you saw for yourself . It 's not just possible , it 's probably . There 's probably millions of intelligent civilizations .
RUTH: So , where is everybody ?
GRAHAM: Well , one of them is right there .
RUTH: Everything I 've ever been told is a lie . My purpose . My truth . All false . DO you know how that feels ? To suddenly have nothing ?
GRAHAM: Just because your truth was n't the truth , it does n't mean there is no truth , Ruth .
RUTH: Huh ?
GRAHAM: I understand you 're probably feeling very confused right now . Religious belief systems are devised to give us context and security . To stop us feeling lonely and unimportant .
RUTH: I do feel lonely and unimportant ! How can this all be an accident ? It does n't make sense . Did you know the reason we have solar eclipses is because the sun is exactly 400 times bigger than the moon and the moon is exactly 400 times closer to the earth ?
GRAHAM: It is n't , it 's a coincidence . Or it probably is . That 's the beauty of the universe .
RUTH: But what 's the point ? If there 's nothing afterwards , what 's the point in living ?
GRAHAM: This is the point , Ruth . Right now . This conversation . That tree , you next cheeseburger . Life is a miracle . People spend so much time focusing on rescuing the princess , they forget how much fun it is to fight the dragon .
RUTH: Huh ?
GRAHAM: Carl Sagan said `` ˜A religion , old o new , that stressed the magnificence of the universe as revealed by modern science might be able to draw forth reserves of reverence and awe hardly tapped by the conventional faiths . '
RUTH: Huh ?
GRAHAM: It 's okay not to know , Ruth . It 's wonderful because it means we still have things to learn . We still have life to live .
RUTH: I 'm frightened .
GRAHAM: So am I , but it passes , sort of . Ruth , we 're on an amazing adventure and I think you should come with us . I know you feel confused and lost but if you get back on board that RV , you might just find the very thing you 're looking for .
RUTH: I I 'm not sure .
GRAHAM: I 'm sure Ruth . I 'm sure because I can honestly say , I have neve talked to a woman for this long without blushing .
RUTH: That 's so sweet . GRAHAM blushes , deep , dark , red .
GRAHAM: She 's going to be fine . I think your hair looks good by the way . You look like Storm .
RUTH: Who 's Storm ?
PAUL: From X-Men .
GRAHAM: Exactly . RUTH goes to the bathroom .
CLIVE: Small corrections ! Small corrections ! RUTH drives . Everyone else is asleep .
PAUL: 11 o'clock , 12 o'clock , 11 o'clock , 12 o'clock , 11 o'clock . Come on ! It 's fun .
RUTH: This is the furthest I 've eve een .
GRAHAM: It looks nice .
PAUL: Hey , we should stop for something to eat . Are you hungry , Ruth ?
RUTH: What ?
CLIVE: I 'm hungry .
PAUL: What 's new , fatty ?
CLIVE: Hey , it 's not fat , it 's power . I happen to be very strong .
PAUL: Pick that up then .
CLIVE: So childish .
RUTH: Maybe I should call Papa .
PAUL: Right up top !
CLIVE: I did it !
RUTH: I wo n't be long .
CLIVE: We 'll order food and wait for you at the bar .
RUTH: Okay .
CLIVE: Be careful .
MOSES BEHE: Tap water .
RUTH: Yes ?
ZOIL: Where are you ? Where are you headed ?
RUTH: Who 's there with you ?
ZOIL: You 're not still talking about his alls , are you ?
RUTH: I i just want to know what 's eal . I 'm confused . I I
JAKE: Hey , slow down there cyclops .
RUTH: I need to get to my friends .
GUS: Why the hurry ? You know I got a friend with one eye who 'd love to meet you .
RUTH: I happen to have two eyes actually . I just have a severe stigmatism .
JAKE: You should get that fixed up . Reckon you 'd be kinda pretty in the ight light .
GUS: Yeah , the dark .
RUTH: Papa said the Lord would fix it .
GUS: The Lord ai n't gon na fix nothing sweetheart .
RUTH: No shit .
GRAHAM: How 's your dad ?
RUTH: We need to leave now .
CLIVE: We 're still waiting on a wet fries .
JAKE: Holy shit ! It 's the space faggots that dinged the fuck-mobile !
CLIVE: Look , I 'm terribly sorry . Perhaps we can exchange insurance details ?
JAKE: I 'm sorry I do n't speak `` ˜nerd ' . GRAHAM and CLIVE look terribly offended .
GUS: These the `` ˜friends ' you told us about , baby ?
RUTH: Yes , they are .
JAKE: Well whaddya know ? Small world .
RUTH: We were just leaving .
GUS: I do n't think so .
GRAHAM: Leave her alone !
JAKE: What did you say ?
CLIVE: He said , leave her alone .
CLIVE: Graham ?
MOSES BEHE: I 'm taking you home .
RUTH: I I ca n't .
MOSES BEHE: Do n't talk back to me , girl !
JAKE: Hey , we ai n't finished with you .
CLIVE: Graham , take Ruth into the RV and lock the door . I do n't want eithe of you to see this .
PAUL: Yo fucknuts !
GRAHAM: Ha ! Only one of us fainted !
PAUL: Tell me you got the food ?
RUTH: It 's them .
GRAHAM: Who ?
RUTH: It was n't my fault . They answered the phone . He knew all about us .
CLIVE: Who ? Who are you talking about ?
PAUL: Get in the RV !
GRAHAM: Was that your dad , Ruth ? RUTH nods .
CLIVE: He was so angry .
RUTH: He 's always angry . GRAHAM , CLIVE and PAUL all exchange looks .
GRAHAM: Are you alright , Ruth ? RUTH nods , still distant .
PAUL: I 'm feeling pretty amped up . Anyone wan na take a walk ?
CLIVE: I 'm game .
GRAHAM: You want to come for a walk , Ruth ?
RUTH: Thanks , but I think I 'm going to turn in . It 's been a long day what with meeting you guys , being abducted by and alien and having my whole belief system called into question .
PAUL: Sorry about that .
GRAHAM: It was amazing though , was n't it ? Remember when Paul said `` ˜Yo fucknuts ' ? That was brilliant .
PAUL: You got ta talk the talk , right ?
CLIVE: What about when I got smacked in the nose ?
PAUL: Yeah yeah Snorlax , you 're a real hero . Come on . Let 's skedaddle . You want anything Ruth ?
RUTH: No , you go , I 'll be fine . Here Clive .
CLIVE: Thank you .
GRAHAM: You can sleep in my bunk if you 'd like .
PAUL: Hey Graham . Check this out . What d'ya think ?
GRAHAM: Space cowboy .
PAUL: Steve Miller Band . I love that song . Speaking of midnight tokers , I got a littler herbal refreshment in my pants . Do you guys partake ?
GRAHAM: No .
PAUL: Shame . I get it from the military . This is the shit that killed Dylan .
GRAHAM: Bob Dylan 's still alive .
PAUL: Is he ?
CLIVE: Let 's party !
GRAHAM: So why `` ˜Paul ' ? It 's not very , you know , alien .
CLIVE: Is it spelt like , P-'-a-w-l-l o something ?
PAUL: No .
GRAHAM: P-o-o-u-r-l ?
PAUL: No , it 's Paul . Like Paul Newman o the little guy from Simon and Garfunkel .
CLIVE: Paul Simon .
PAUL: Paul Simon . Paul 's not my real name . It 's a name I got given .
GRAHAM: What 's your real name ?
PAUL: You wo n't be able to pronounce it .
CLIVE: I can speak Klingon .
PAUL: What a geek .
CLIVE: Hey !
GRAHAM: Come on , what 's your real name . PAUL opens his mouth and screeches .
PAUL: Roooooootttchaaaaaaaaaaa .
CLIVE: Roooooootttttttccchhaaaa .
PAUL: That 's pretty good .
GRAHAM: Rootchaa ? That sounds like Roger .
PAUL: Fuck you !
CLIVE: Calm down , Rog .
GRAHAM: You look like a poster on a student 's wall .
PAUL: That was my gag ! `` ˜Take me to you dealer ' right ? Yeah , that was mine . Never saw a dime .
GRAHAM: You never answered my question . Why Paul ? Who called you Paul ?
PAUL: The little girl who found me when I crashed . It was terrible actually . I killed her dog . I did n't mean to ! My ship sort of landed on it . When the military arrived I was delirious ; I kept saying `` Paul ? Paul ? `` � It was the only English I knew , because I 'd heard the little girl saying it over and over . Spooks thought it was my name .
CLIVE: She called her dog Paul ?
PAUL: Least it was n't Mr. Muggles .
GRAHAM: What happened to the little girl ?
PAUL: Who knows ? Never saw her again . Think about her everyday though .
CLIVE: It 's strange , is n't it ? Ordinarily in this situation Graham and I would be looking up at the stars , wondering about life on othe planets but we know now , do n't we ? It 's a bit of an anti-climax .
PAUL: Thanks a bunch , Hurley .
CLIVE: I do n't mean that in a bad way . They all scratch their noses .
GRAHAM: Paul , can I ask you something ?
PAUL: Shoot .
GRAHAM: Why are you in such a hurry to leave ?
PAUL: I 've outlived my usefulness .
CLIVE: How so ?
PAUL: There 's only so much knowledge I can share about the universe and quantum theory and how to make a eally nice meatball sandwich . The only thing I have to offer them now are my abilities .
GRAHAM: So ?
PAUL: So the only way they 're going to get hold of them is by obtaining some of somatic stem cells .
GRAHAM: So what , do they take a swab from your cheek ?
PAUL: Negative .
CLIVE: Stool ?
PAUL: Sadly , not that simple .
GRAHAM: Blood ? ! Oh my god , I hate needles .
PAUL: Believe me , a needle would be a picnic compared to what they had in store for me .
CLIVE: I do n't follow .
PAUL: Stem cells are multipotent . GRAHAM and CLIVE look blank .
CLIVE: I thought the crash was our fault .
PAUL: Well it was , kinda .
GRAHAM: So , you 're saying if they catch you
PAUL: So tell me , are you guys virgins o what ?
CLIVE: Comic-Con 2005 . Ewok chick .
PAUL: Three years ago you had sex with a midget ?
CLIVE: She was an Ewok ! Sniff .
PAUL: There are only two types of person small enough to fit inside an Ewok costume .
CLIVE: She was a midget .
PAUL: I ca n't believe you thought boning a space bear sounded less embarrassing than a person of short stature .
CLIVE: I know . I 'm sorry .
PAUL: Was it nice ?
PAUL: You sly dog !
CLIVE: How did that happen ?
PAUL: Sorry , I get this thing when I get high . It 's called `` ˜projective empathy ' . You feel what I feel .
GRAHAM: Like in E.T . ?
PAUL: Exactly .
CLIVE: Oh , thank God . For a second there I thought I 'd got drunk on Lite beer .
GRAHAM: Oh dear !
PAUL: I ca n't walk through there .
CLIVE: How are we going to get back ?
GRAHAM: Maybe we should hold hands , so that we look like a family .
PAUL: That 's great ! Two grown men who look like sex offenders holding hands with a child cowboy .
CLIVE: You could be a midget .
PAUL: You 're obsessed with midgets !
GRAHAM: Seem to be working , Clive . Clive ?
CLIVE: I must have it .
GRAHAM: It 's very cheap . Are you sure you do n't want to save up and get a proper on ?
CLIVE: Oh , come on , we 've got time .
RUTH: Where have you been ? I was worried .
ZOIL: Good morning , Ma'am . Sorry to trouble you . Agent Zoil , Secret Service . Your wagon here matches the description of a recreational vehicle we 're currently looking for . May I ask , are you alone ? RUTH pauses a second .
RUTH: Yes , I 'm alone .
ZOIL: Do you mind taking a look at these pictures ?
RUTH: No , sorry I do n't .
ZOIL: Where are you coming from , Ma'am ?
RUTH: Christian ministry in Seattle . I 've een driving for 5 days .
ZOIL: Going far ?
RUTH: Austin .
ZOIL: Great town .
RUTH: Oh yes . It has an impressive bat population you know ?
ZOIL: Is that so ?
RUTH: Uh-huh . Well , I really should be getting along .
ZOIL: Of course . Thanks for your time , Miss ? Beat .
RUTH: Darwin , Charlotte Darwin . ZOIL smiles and nods . He laves .
PAUL: How 's it going ?
CHILD: Is that you ?
PAUL: No .
CHILD: It looks like you .
PAUL: Suppose it does . What 's your name ?
CHILD: Keith Nash .
PAUL: I 'm Paul . Pleased to meet you . They shake hands .
KEITH NASH: My Mom 's shopping for some new jeans . She lets me wait in here .
PAUL: Sounds like a good Mum .
KEITH NASH: Yes and no . What 're you doing here ?
PAUL: My friend 's buying a sword . He 's a grown man .
KEITH NASH: What a nerd . PAUL laughs . So does KEITH NASH .
PAUL: You an M & Ms man , Keith ?
KEITH NASH: I am but I should n't .
PAUL: Strangers with candy , right ?
KEITH NASH: Right .
PAUL: Well , we 've got a lot in common . We oth like comics and M & Ms . Guess that makes us pals .
KEITH NASH: Guess so .
PAUL: You read this one ?
KEITH NASH: No .
PAUL: It 's a good one . Take it . Go on . It 's a gift .
KEITH NASH: Thanks Paul .
PAUL: Catch you later , Keith Nash .
CLIVE: Who was that ?
PAUL: Keith Nash . How much was that ?
CLIVE: $ 299.99 . It 's made of a low grade Turkish alloy .
PAUL: What did you get , speccy ?
GRAHAM: X-Men action figure .
PAUL: Jesus Cheeeerist .
MRS. NASH: Do n't lie , Keith .
KEITH NASH: I 'm not lying .
MRS. NASH: Oh , come on now , Keith . If you carry on like this , you 'll have to come with me to Dress Barn .
KEITH NASH: Honestly Mommy , he was an alien and his name was Paul !
MRS. NASH: Whoever hard of an alien called Paul ?
HAGGARD: What did you say , kid ?
MRS. NASH: Excuse me . Who are you ?
HAGGARD: Agent Haggard Ma'am , Secret Service .
MRS. NASH: Secret Service ? !
HAGGARD: Kid ?
KEITH NASH: He was in the shop .
HAGGARD: Is he still in there ? KEITH shakes his head .
O'REILLY: Did he say where he was going ?
HAGGARD: South . Toward New Mexico , huh ?
O'REILLY: We 've got him man ! We 're going to get a fucking promotion .
HAGGARD: You did good kid . Want a candy ?
KEITH NASH: No thanks .
HAGGARD: Let 's go . The two agents rush off .
O'REILLY: What about Zoil ?
HAGGARD: Screw Zoil !
ZOIL: And you were just gon na take off ?
HAGGARD: Thought it best to take the initiative , sir . We were going to adio you .
ZOIL: Well now , that 's mighty civil of you . We have a chain of command . I expect you to abide by it . Where d'you say he was headed ?
HAGGARD: New Mexico sir .
ZOIL: Well , then let 's move it . They scramble .
MOSES BEHE: Looks like you 're going the wrong way , Agent Zoil . That 's what happens when you do n't got the Lord on your side .
PAUL: He likes you , y'know ?
RUTH: Graham ? D'you think ?
PAUL: What are you , blind ? Beat .
RUTH: Papa said the Lord would fix it . Guess that 's not gon na happen , seeing as we 're living in a gigantic godless universe , with no hope of salvation .
PAUL: Hey , I do n't know categorically that it 's godless . I just said `` ˜probably ' .
RUTH: Oh , that 's a relief .
PAUL: Look , the way you 're feeling now , that 's why religion appeared in the first place . It 's like existential Prozac . Imagine being five yea sold and having no adults around to tell you why it snows or what trees are for . That 's how it is for much of humanity . Faith is a night- light . It illuminates the scary corners , fills the gaps , makes the universe easier to comprehend . Thing is , it 's okay not to know everything . I mean , who knows what 's really out there ? Did you know astrophysicists recently identified the equation for the creation of matter ?
RUTH: Yes .
PAUL: Oh . Well , then you get it , right ? If they have the theory , who 's to say at some point in the future they wo n't put it into practice and who 's to say someone else did n't do that 13.5 Billion years ago and that 's how the universe came to be ? Course , then we get the eternal problem of who created the creato ut that 's a whole other car park . I think Shakespeare said it best . `` There 's more in Heaven and earth than is dreamt of in you philosophy Horatio '' � .
RUTH: What did you call me ?
PAUL: Horatio . It 's from Hamlet . You know , the Prince of Denmark ?
RUTH: Denmark has a municipal population of 508,691 . PAUL blinks .
PAUL: Anyway , if there is a God , did n't he create doctors and hospitals and scalpels and shit , so he would n't have to go round fixing people 's lazy eyeballs ?
RUTH: I suppose so .
PAUL: The eye is a delicate and complex thing , Ruth . You should get it taken care of .
RUTH: They 're back .
PAUL: Perfect .
CLIVE: What are you going to do with this ?
PAUL: Phone home .
ZOIL: Yes , sir ?
VOICE: Satellite 's come up with a data analysis on all the traffic coming out of Prospect in the last 5 hours . There was only one RV , and guess what , nimrod ?
ZOIL: It was n't going to New Mexico ?
VOICE: That 's a three pointer Agent Zoil . You better spin your ass around . You got some serious catching up to do . Do n't make me come out there .
ZOIL: No , sir . Where are they headed ? If we gun it , maybe we can get the drop on their destination .
VOICE: They 're on the 50 , heading towards Gillette .
ZOIL: What else is around there ?
VOICE: Not much . Thunder Basis , Bethlehem Creek .
ZOIL: Bethlehem Creek ?
VOICE: Holy shit !
GRAHAM: You do n't think she 's still there do you ?
PAUL: That 's what you 're going to find out for me .
CLIVE: Us ?
PAUL: I ca n't just knock can I ? What if she 's moved on and someone else answers ? I 'm sick of people fainting on me . I 'll hang back with my buddy Ruth , you two make first contact . Just enjoy it .
CLIVE: What shall we say if it 's her ? We 're here with the alien that killed your dog sixty years ago ?
PAUL: Yes . Hurry up , there 's going to be a really big storm in exactly 34 minutes .
RUTH: How do you know ?
PAUL: It 's my job to know .
GRAHAM: Hello ?
CLIVE: Knock again .
GRAHAM: Okay . GRAHAM goes to leave . CLIVE stops him .
CLIVE: Miss Walton , I 'm the writer , Clive Gollings and this is my friend and colleague , Graham Willy . We 're from England and we 're here with the alien that killed your dog 60 years ago .
TARA: What is this , some kind of joke ?
CLIVE: It 's no joke . PAUL materializes between GRAHAM and CLIVE .
PAUL: Hello Tara .
RUTH: Maybe I should make some tea .
TARA: Where are my manners ? I neve eally have guests . Nobody comes up here . I go whole weeks without seeing a soul .
PAUL: Can I do anything to help ?
TARA: I 've only just stopped believing in you , y'know ? Spent a very long time trying to convince folk about what happened that night . My parents , my friends . Everyone thought I was mad . They told me it was a meteo that squashed little Paul . Took me away and did tests they did , said it was for cosmic radiation . They said I was concussed , hallucinating , but I knew you were eal . I pulled you from that spaceship myself . Sat with you till the men came and took you away . If Pop had n't had to go to Casper , he would have seen you too . They kept telling me I 'd imagined it but I knew different . Pop tried to understand but they filled his head with `` ˜delayed this ' and `` ˜post- traumatic that ' . He just used to smile and say `` ˜there , there Tara ' . He got sick when I was seventeen and died a few years later . I inherited this place . Word got out about my story not long after it happened , so I did n't really have any friends . Kids used to throw stones at the house and call me names . I just kinda retreated into myself . I 'd spend whole nights up on the roof , staring at the sky , hoping to catch a glimpse of you again . I always believed that one day you '' ˜d come back and here you are .
PAUL: I 'm so sorry .
TARA: What for ?
PAUL: For killing your dog and ruining your life .
TARA: That does n't matter . Do n't you see ? You 're real . I was right and all those folk that said I was crazy ? Well , they can all go fuck themselves .
PAUL: It 's good to see you , Tara .
TARA: Now , where do you suppose that came from ?
PAUL: Fuck a duck ! Get out !
TARA: In back .
ZOIL: Paul , wait-
PAUL: Clive ?
CLIVE: Yes ?
PAUL: A little help ?
HAGGARD: Freeze , space monkey !
GRAHAM: We 're cut off .
TARA: Storm cellar !
ZOIL: Godammit Haggard !
PAUL: Not a fucking cent .
ZOIL: Oh great !
PAUL: Come on !
GRAHAM: Ow , my shins !
ZOIL: Help me up !
RUTH: Papa ? PAUL grabs RUTH 's hand .
PAUL: Come on .
MOSES BEHE: Take your hands off her , devil !
O'REILLY: Ready or not . He fires .
CLIVE: I 'll drive !
GRAHAM: Punch it !
TARA: My weed !
ZOIL: Damnit Haggard , wait !
GRAHAM: Your dad 's persistent , is n't he ?
RUTH: You have no idea . CLIVE sees their pursuers in his wing mirror .
CLIVE: I think we have a problem .
GRAHAM: What do we do ?
PAUL: Go left .
CLIVE: What ?
TO HIMSELF: What the hell is he doing ? !
ZOIL: Sir , I-
HAGGARD: In pursuit , sir .
VOICE: Who the hell is this ?
HAGGARD: Haggard , sir . Agent Zoil has been compromised . I 'm assuming command .
VOICE: I do n't give a shit who 's in command . Where ' my fucking mooncoon ? !
HAGGARD: Just ahead of me sir . We 're heading East across scrubland just North of Mitchell Creek .
VOICE: I do n't wan na hear from either of you jokers until that little mothe fucker is under glass .
HAGGARD: Yes sir ! HAGGARD floors it . He is manic and wild eyed .
CLIVE: They 're trying to overtake .
PAUL: Do n't let him get past .
CLIVE: Shall I ram him ?
TO HIMSELF: Immense pressure and temperature drop . High winds , circulating in the troposphere , two opposed fronts clashing . Oh , this is going to be a good one .
RUTH: Oh my God .
ZOIL: -Shit !
CLIVE: Are you sure you know what you 're doing ? !
PAUL: Twenty seconds .
TARA: Paul , we 'll get sucked right up .
PAUL: Stay on target .
CLIVE: Paul !
PAUL: Stay on target .
ZOIL: He 's insane !
ZOIL: Haggard , stand down . Stand down !
GRAHAM: It 's gone !
CLIVE: Where did it go ?
ZOIL: Son of a bitch ! ZOIL looks at the sky . His face drops .
CLIVE: They 're still coming !
PAUL: Ruth , why do n't you count back from
RUTH: Okay . 109
PAUL: Back where I 'm from , tornadoes are part of our daily life . We 've learnt how to live with them , how to understand them .
CLIVE: They 're gaining !
PAUL: We 've learnt to anticipate thei ehavior , know their personalities , know when they 're playing games .
GRAHAM: What games ?
PAUL: Hide and seek ?
CLIVE: Great Caesar 's ghost !
RUTH: How did you do that ? How did you know ?
PAUL: Evolution baby .
CLIVE: We 've lost them .
GRAHAM: Sorry .
RUTH: Wait , what about Papa ?
CLIVE: I only saw one car following us .
PAUL: Where 's Tara ? TARA comes out of the toilet .
TARA: The bulb 's gone in there .
GRAHAM: That was just awesome . Amazing driving Clive . It was like G.T.A . ut potentially fatal . Was n't it , Clive ? Clive ?
CLIVE: Oh no .
GRAHAM: There goes the deposit .
CLIVE: Fare thee well friend . You were a faithful and mighty steed .
TARA: She rode that storm with a bullet in her heart and did n't stop until we we 're safe .
RUTH: If there is a benevolent creato watching over everything then may he , she or it bless the 1985 Holiday Rambler , Imperial .
GRAHAM: Paul ?
VOICE: Zoil ! What the hell is going on ?
ZOIL: We got hit by a twister , sir . Haggard 's dead .
VOICE: What about the other one ?
ZOIL: I lost him when the ranch exploded .
VOICE: Jesus Christ , Zoil , this has been one fuck up after another . I should have handled it myself . I want that little bastard dead by midnight tonight or you 'll be working security in a convention centre . Now where 's that RV ?
RUTH: What you may not know is on the outside of the tower they bolted a series of ladders , all the way to the top , put there by William Rogers in 1893 . He was the first man to climb the tower .
TARA: I climbed up there in 1976 . Thought it would make a good site for some UFO spotting . Turns out I was n't the only one .
PAUL: We call them IFOs .
TARA: Cute .
PAUL: I-thank-you .
TARA: Pretty .
GRAHAM: What now ?
PAUL: We wait . A light appears in the sky some way off .
FROWNING: That was quick .
PAUL: Wait a minute
VOICE: Well , whaddya know ? Small world .
PAUL: Lorenzo ? !
VOICE: It was you ! You told him . I should 've known .
ZOIL: He 's my friend ! I 've known him fo twenty years . He introduced me to my wife damnit !
VOICE: You stupid son of a bitch . In five years , you could have been where I am .
ZOIL: I do n't want to be where you are .
VOICE: Too bad , seeing as I 'm the one hold'ng all the cards and when I say `` cards '' � , I of course mean big fucking gun . VOICE points his gun at PAUL .
PAUL: How 'd you find me ?
VOICE: It was pretty easy once we got a fix on the geek-mobile . Was n't hard to figure out where you were headed . You always did have a flare for the dramatic .
CLIVE: He 's not going anywhere .
VOICE: Be honest with yourself , two scoops . What is it that you think you can possibly bring to the table at this stage in the game ?
CLIVE: Blind fury . The blade falls off .
VOICE: Step aside , you fat nerd .
IN KLINGON: Graham , his this man .
RUTH: Leave him alone !
GRAHAM: Leave her alone !
TARA: Leave them alone .
PAUL: Thank you , Tara .
TARA: Do n't mention it .
ZOIL: The things I do for you , huh ?
PAUL: You know I appreciate it .
ZOIL: Do you have any idea how difficult it was to catch you guys ?
LAUGHS: Let me take a look at that . Ruth , shine the torch down here ? RUTH grabs a torch and steps in behind PAUL .
MOSES BEHE: Oh Lord , Ruth . My little Ruth .
GRAHAM: Noooooooooo !
MOSES BEHE: II never meant to shoot her . I was aiming for the goblin .
CLIVE: He 's not a goblin he 's from anothe planet .

TRAINING CAPTAIN: McCawley ! Walker ! Cut that out !
RAFE: I thought this was a training flight . I 'm just trying to give Danny some training .
DANNY: Not on your best day , boy !
TRAINING CAPTAIN: That 's it , get into a wedge !
RAFE: Did n't you say test the limits ?
DANNY: Hey , you wan na test my limits , you bette line up a couple dozen women on the GROUNDcause I got NO limits in the air !
TRAINING CAPTAIN: Everybody down !
DANNY: If I had guns I 'd be chewing up your

TRAINING CAPTAIN: You 're down , Walker ! That 's an order !
DANNY: What about him ?
TRAINING CAPTAIN: He 's not taking my orders anymore .
DANNY: He 's gon na do it .

BILLY: Why ?
DANNY: Cause now he 's gon na do an outside loop .
TRAINING CAPTAIN: Aw shit . Aw shit shit shit
RED: Aw sh- sh- sh- sh-
BILLY: Shit .
RED: Yeah .
DANNY: You can do it , Rafe . You can do it .
DOOLITTLE: There are some people who think the outside loop is reckless and irresponsible .
RAFE: How could it be irresponsible , Sir , if you were the first man in the world to do it ?
DOOLITTLE: Do n't get smart with me , son .
RAFE: Never , Sir . I just meant it 's dangerous only for the kind of pilot who wants to show off , rather than inspire the othe pilots in his unit . And all you 've done for me , Sir , working out the transfer , I did it to say thanks . To honor you , Sir . What the French call a `` homage . ''
DOOLITTLE: That 's bullshit , son . But it 's really good bullshit .
RAFE: Thank you , Sir .
DOOLITTLE: Good luck over there McCawley . I admire your decision .
RAFE: Thank you , Sir .
BILLY: You good-lookin ' sumbitchdo n't you EVER die !
ANTHONY: That 's your line for tonight , ya know .
BILLY: What , good-lookin ' sumbitch ?
ANTHONY: No , numbnuts , die . You get your nurse alone , you look her in the eye , and say , `` Baby , they 're training me for war , and I do n't know what 'll happen . But if I die tomorrow , I wan na know that we lived all we could tonight . '' I 've never known it to fail .
RED: He 's n-never known it to work , either .
DANNY: Doolittle did n't kill you ? Attaboy ! Rafe catches Danny 's arm .
RAFE: Danny , there 's something I got ta tell you
DANNY: How could you do this ?
RAFE: The Colonel helped me work it out .
DANNY: I do n't mean how 'd you do the paperwork , I mean how the hell did you do it without letting me in on it ?
RAFE: I 'm sorry , Danny , but they 're only accepting the best pilots .
DANNY: Do n't make this a joke , Rafe . You 're talking about war , and I know what wa does to people .
RAFE: Danny , you know how many times I saw you come to school with a black eye or a usted nose , and could n't do a thing about it for you , or for your mother or your father , with his lungs scorched out with mustard gas , and more left of his lungs than there was of his spirit ? You 've made your sacrifice , Danny . It 's time I made mine .
BILLY: The nurses are waiting !
RAFE: Let 's go .
DANNY: Nah , you go on .
RAFE: I have to talk to Evelyn . And I want you to meet her .
DANNY: Some other time . I do n't feel like a party .
PILOTS VOICE: Nurses ! Nurses ! Nurses !
BETTY: Do you have trouble with your boobs in the uniform ?
BARBARA: You mean hiding them ?
BETTY: Hide them ? On a date with pilots ? I 'm talking about how you make them show ! SANDRA , another nurse , speaks up .
SANDRA: Loan 'em to me , I 'll make 'em show .
BETTY: The boobs or the pilots ?
BARBARA: We 'll ask Evelyn . Evelyn ? Evelyn !
BETTY: Ooo , she 's thinking of her date ! Come on , you 've been dating a pilot . We want to know what we can expect .
EVELYN: I 've been dating one pilot . And only fo a few weeks . But I know he 's different from all the others .
SANDRA: True love !
BETTY: Morphine , give her morphine !
BARBARA: Give her an enema .
EVELYN: But I do have a warning for you . There 's one line you all need to know , and you 're likely to hear it from any man in a uniform . It goes like this `` Honey , Baby We never know what 's gon na happen , and I may die tomorrowso , let 's live all we can tonight . '' A silence among the nurses .
BARBARA: I tell you . Any one of those arrogant , leather-jacketed , slick-lookin ' flyboys tries that line on mehe 's gon na get anything he wants . As the nurses laugh
EVELYN: Stick with me , I 'll find you somebody good . Betty spot 's Rafe .
BETTY: I 'll take that one .
EVELYN: He 's taken . But come on , I 'll introduce you .
RAFE: Hello , Lieutenant . Good to see you .
EVELYN: You too , Lieutenant . Betty clears her throat .
RAFE: Nice to meet you , Betty .
EVELYN: Danny 's not coming ?
RAFE: No , hegot some news today . He 'll be okay , he just did n't feel like coming tonight .
EVELYN: I was hoping to meet him .
BETTY: I was hoping to meet him .
RAFE: We 'll just have to find a substitute , wo n't we ? Betty stops , and faces Rafe .
BETTY: I just want to tell you one thing . If you 're thinking this might be your last night on earth ? I 'm prepared to make it meaningful . Very meaningful .
EVELYN: At ease , Betty !
RED: He , I 'm R-Red . Red S-Strange .
BETTY: RedStrange ?
RED: You know the football player , Red G- Grange ? Well the guys called me R-Red , cause you know , I 'm redand they thought I was strange , so , you know , Red G-Grange , Red Str-Strange .
BETTY: Butthey called you Strange ? Because of Red Grange ? I do n't get it . Was Red Grange strange ?
RED: How would I know .
BETTY: Do you always stutter ?
RED: Only when I 'm n-n-n-
BETTY: Nervous ?
RED: Yeah . But if I have to get something out , I c-can always s-s-s-
BETTY: Do n't be nervous .
EVELYN: There shipping us out . Hawaii . The Germans are overrunning Europe , and we 're sent to paradise . How about you ? Have you heard anything ?
BILLY: You 're a very special woman , andwell aby , they 're training me for war , and we do n't know what happens tomorrow . So we got ta make tonight special .
BARBARA: I hope you can back that up , flyboy . Cause you 're not ever gon na forget tonight .
EVELYN: Whatever you 're trying to tell me is n't good , is it . Or it would n't be so hard to say .
RAFE: The only reason it 's hard to say is that I keep thinking I do n't have the right to say it . But I 've got to because it 's true . I love you . That must surprise you .
EVELYN: It surprises me that I 'm not the only one on this balcony who feels that way .
RAFE: There 's one thing I have to say . I 'm going away .
EVELYN: We 're all going away .
RAFE: I 'm going to the war . The real war . Hitler 's taken Europe . The Brits are hanging on by their fingernails , and If they lose , there 'll be more people killed than anybody can imagine . And not just there , but here .
EVELYN: But you 're in the U.S. Army , how could you
RAFE: Colonel Doolittle pulled the strings , and put me on loan to the R.A.F . They need pilots , and we need experience . I leave tomorrow .
EVELYN: You waited til tonight to tell me ?
RAFE: I had to tell you in person . Because there 's something else I need to say .
EVELYN: I do n't know if you can choose that , Rafe .
RAFE: Maybe not . But I need you to know . I love you . And I will come back . I 'll find a way . And then we 'll get a chance to know if what I felt the first moment I saw you , and every minute since then , is eal .
EVELYN: Do one thing for me , before you go . She takes his hand and leads him inside .
CONDUCTOR'S VOICE: All aboard !
DANNY: Did n't you say you told her not to come ?
RAFE: Yeah .
DANNY: Then why are you looking for her ?
RAFE: It 's a test . If I asked her to come and she came , it would n't tell me anything . If I tell her not to come , and she comesthen I know she loves me .
VOICE: ALL ABOARD !
DANNY: You 're still a kid , ya know that ? Take care of yourself .
RAFE: You too .
DANNY: Give 'em hell , Rafe .
RAFE: Rafe McCawley , Sir .
GUARD: I 've died and gone to heaven .
BARBARA: You know the ratio of men to women on this island ? Four-thousandto one .
EVELYN: Thank youEnsign .
PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT: Please be seated , gentlemen . They sit , as one .
GENERAL MARSHALL: We 've increased supply shipments to them , Mr. President , and we 're losing merchant vessels every day .
PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT: Shift in every destroyer and anti- aircraft weapon you can find .
ADMIRAL: Sir , our Pacific Fleet is already down to almost nothing .
PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT: Gentlemen , at this moment the nation of Hungry has a larger military then the United States . We have no choice but to draw from whatever we can .
NISHIKURA: So you join us , Admiral . Some of us thought your education at an American university would make you too weak to fight the Americans .
YAMAMOTO: If knowledge of opponents and careful calculation of danger is taken as weakness then I have misunderstood what it means to be Japanese .
NISHIKURA: The time has come to strike ! Or to sit and let the Americans cut off our oil and our future . I know what you whisper to the others , Yamamoto that the Americans are strong . Yet look at their leader .
OYAMA: Franklin Roosevelt . Born into great wealth . Fifteen years ago , he was stricken with polio . Now he can not walk , or even stand without help . Photographers will not take pictures of him in his chair ; Americans do not wish to know how weak their President is . Yamamoto makes a low grunt .
NISHIKURA: You have something to say , Yamamoto ?
YAMAMOTO: The Council knows I have opposed fighting the Americans . No matter how great ou esolve , they have resources beyond ours . If we must go to war , there is only one way deal them a blow from which it will take them years to recover . In that time we can conquer all of the Pacific , and they will have no choice but to ask fo peace .
NISHIKURA: You see us as capable of such a blow ?
YAMAMOTO: The Americans themselves have made it possible . We will annihilate them in a single attack at Pearl Harbor .
RED: If I ai n't n-never on a b-boat again , it 'll be too s-soon .
BILLY: Where are the women on this
RED: They 're s-still asleep ! Danny pauses for a moment , then shouts
DANNY: Drop your cocks and grab your socks , oys ! The terror of the skies are here !
ANTHONY: They 're all drunk .
DANNY: Hey . You . Mr. Coma .
COMA: Where 's that lizard ?
DANNY: What lizard ?
COMA: The one that slept in my mouth last night .
DANNY: What the hell happened to you guys ?
COMA: Ever hear of mai-tai 's ? Comes in a igpot . Likelike
RED: A m-missionary ?
COMA: No , like
DANNY: This is an Air Base ? Where 's your squad commander ?
RED: I th-think I 'm gon na like it here .
COMA: You guys are new ?
DANNY: Yeah .
COMA: Mai-tai 's . I got this to tell ya , about mai-tai 's .
DANNY: Hey ! What is this , the planes all unched up like that ?
MECHANIC: The brass is afraid of sabotage . This makes 'em easier to protect and easie to service .
DANNY: What about easier to hit in an air raid ?
MECHANIC: Who 's gon na to that ? Japan is fou thousand miles away . So you guys just arrived , huh ?
DANNY: Yeah .
MECHANIC: We got a saying here . A-low-HA !
DANNY: Well guysI reckon there 's just one thing to do
RED: More m-mai-tai 's ! Coma is sitting there with them , beside Red .
COMA: Absolutely right .
ANTHONY: I never knew those dances were so sophisticated .
COMA: Fish nibble at her breasts
BILLY: Hey , is n't that Evelyn ? Danny moves up to look .
DANNY: Rafe 's girl , Evelyn ?
COMA: You guys know her ? ! I got ta have an intro ! Man , I 'd like to
DANNY: A friend of mine 's in love with her . So you do n't even look not ever .
OTHER PILOTS: To Rafe .
COMA: Uh oh . Volcanic eruption !
RED: Well , you p-puked on his feet .
COMA: Yeah , but he was wearing shoes !
ADMIRAL KIMMEL: transfer twelve more destroyers to Atlantic Fleet , and all the available anti-aircraft weaponry ? ! Washington has gone insane ! Kimmel 's STRATEGIC ANALYST speaks up .
STRATEGIC ANALYST: We 've done what you ordered , Admiral , and war gamed the likely outcome of a Japanese attack against each of our majo ases in the Pacific . Wake , Guam , Midway , the Philippines . In each case , we lose .
ADMIRAL KIMMEL: You left out Hawaii .
STRATEGIC ANALYST: Pearl Harbor ca n't be attacked effectively from the air . It 's too shallow for an aerial torpedo attack . Pearl Harbor 's safe . It 's everywhere else that we 're vulnerable .
ADMIRAL KIMMEL: Step up surveillance of Japanese communications . They 're gon na do something somewhere . I can feel it .
GENDA: Look at the ships all grouped . Perfect targets !
JAPANESE OFFICER: And the planes ! They are what is that American expression ? Sitting geese ?
YAMAMOTO: Sitting ducks .
JAPANESE OFFICER: How can they be so foolish ?
YAMAMOTO: They think no one would be stupid enough to attack them at Pearl Harbor .
GENDA: Or perhaps they think no one is capable . Look at this
YAMAMOTO: Uncharged torpedoes have different alance .
GENDA: I have arranged a live fire drill with your permission .
BILLY: Are you sure they 're here ?
ANTHONY: If Evelyn 's here , the rest are here !
RED: Shut up . Red moves away , to polish his shoes .
ANTHONY: What is it with Red ? I 've never seen him this way .
BILLY: He 's been like that all day . Hey Danny , you coming ?
DANNY: Nah , I 'm gon na stay here . Read .
BARBARA: Now listen , it 's hands off Billy . I mean , you can put your hands on him if you want to , but then my hands will break yours .
BETTY: He was that good ?
BARBARA: No , I was .
BILLY: Red , Peeping Tom stuff can get us court- marshaled .
RED: Shhh !
ANTHONY: Oh SandraI like youlove you
IAN: Leapin ' Jesus !
RAFE: The struts are loose , the hydraulics are leaking , and the electrical system 's shorting out in the cockpit .
IAN: Well which of those three ya want fixed ?
RAFE: All of 'em .
IAN: If ye 'd wanted a bloody Cadillac ya should ' a stayed in the bloody States !
RAFE: And if you do n't give me a plane that can handle combat , you better start learning to speak German .
IAN: Fook ya !
RAFE: Learn English , then !
IAN: Fook ya dooble !
BRITISH PILOT: Bloody Krauts ! Night raid !
IAN: I have'na been able ta
RAFE: Crank her !
IAN: God speed ya , laddie .
RAFE: Here they come .
SQUAD LEADER: McCawley ! Get to the clouds ! Get into the clouds ! RAFE , IN HIS PLANE , is flying blind .
RAFE: I ca n't see the clouds !
SQUAD LEADER: Get out of there , McCawley ! Get out of there !
WHITE BOXER: You hit hard for a cook .
BARBARA: Let 's get into civvies and find a bar .
MARTHA: Right after church ?
BARBARA: You 've got ta sin some , to get forgiveness . Come with us , Evelyn . You need some sin .
EVELYN: I 've got to write some requisitions . We 're undersupplied with morphine .
BETTY: Morphine ? We 've been here a month and nobody 's had worse than a sunburn .
BARBARA: You do n't forget love , Honey . Not ever .
EVELYN: Can I help you , sailor ?
DORIE: 'Scuse me , 'Mam . All the ship 's doctors is golfing , and I could n't find nobody to look at this .
EVELYN: Our doctor 's gone too .
DORIE: Sorry to trouble you .
EVELYN: Wait , let me look at that You bette come in here .
DORIE: Boxin ' .
EVELYN: Win ?
DORIE: Yes 'm .
EVELYN: What 's your name ?
DORIE: Dorie Miller , 'Mam .
EVELYN: I 'm Evelyn . And I 'm just a nurse . But I 'm not playing golf , and that cut needs sewing , or else it 's gon na make a big lumpy scar . Whatta ya say ?
DORIE: Every other Sunday . I 'm heavyweight champion of the West Virginia .
EVELYN: What do you get for winning ?
DORIE: Respect . She hands him a mirror . He studies her work .
EVELYN: Tell me something , Dorie . A man as big as you and smart too , you knew where to come when your ship could n't help do you still have to fight with you fists to get respect ?
DORIE: I left my Mama and joined the Navy to be a man . They made me a cook and not even that , really I clean up after the other sailors eat . I shine the officer 's shoes . In two years , they 've never even let me fire a gun . Now Evelyn understands .
EVELYN: You take care , Dorie .
DORIE: You too , 'Mam .
EVELYN: Rafe
DANNY: Lieutenant I 'm Danny Walker . I 'm Rafe McCawley 's best friend .
EVELYN: Were . Is n't that what you mean ? Were . Because he 's dead , is n't he ? And that 's why you 've come .
DANNY: Before Rafe left , he asked me to be the one to tell you , if it happened .
EVELYN: He told me about you . That he had no other friend like you .
DANNY: Rafe 's folks had a crop dusting business , owned their own planes . Real straight , frugal . My father was the town drunk . Went to sleep one night on the railroad tracks and was still there when the Dawn Express came along . Rafe and I were the only ones at the funeral . He took me ack to his house , and I never left .
EVELYN: You were more like brothers .
DANNY: I taught him to drink beer . He taught me how to fly .
EVELYN: He said you 're the only one he ever saw who was better in the air than him .
DANNY: He said that ?
YAMAMOTO: Everything real except the fact that no one is shooting back at us .
GENDA: If we achieve surprise , they will offe little resistance .
YAMAMOTO: Set up teams of radio operators to send out messages the Americans will intercept , concerning every potential American target in the Pacific . Include Hawaii the clutter will be more confusing that way .
GENDA: Brilliant , Admiral .
YAMAMOTO: A brilliant man would find a way not to fight a war .
AIDE: Mr. President , we 've received a message from the Argentinian ambassador to Japan . His sources tell him the Japanese are assembling their fleet to attack us .
PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT: We 're picking up warnings for every American base in the Pacific . Does this ambassador know the target ?
AIDE: Not for sure . But he thinks it 's Pearl Harbor .
PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT: Tell the Pentagon .
ADMIRAL: The attack seems inevitable . The question is where ? The way to answe that question is to ask if we were the Japanese , how would we do it ?
VICE ADMIRAL: Between America and the Far East are the sea lanes where the winds and the currents make the best route fo shipping . Far above is the northern oute , between Canada and Russia . Between these two is something they call the Vacant Sea . If I were the Japs , I 'd send a task force there . You could hide the entire land mass of Asia in the Vacant Sea , and nobody would know .
ADMIRAL: So they pop out and attack where ?
VICE ADMIRAL: That 's the problem , Admiral . They could hit anywhere they want . Nobody has any solution .
DENTAL ASSISTANT: Dr. Takanawa , you have a call from Tokyo .
DENTIST: Please excuse me . Just relax .
LISTENER: Here 's something , over the line from Tokyo .
TRACER: It 's connected to a local dentist . His office is beside Pearl Harbor .
LISTENER: Sounds too innocent . His accent is from the old country . Somebody official- sounding calls , he thinks it 's discourteous not to respond .
AIDE: Sir , we just had an intelligence intercept . Someone from Tokyo called a local dentist whose office looks ove Pearl . They wanted to know the exact location of the ships .
ADMIRAL KIMMEL: Someone from Tokyo asks a dentist how the ships are sitting What are we supposed to do about that ?
AIDE: Ido n't know , Sir . But it just seemed significant .
ADMIRAL KIMMEL: Have intelligence keep monitoring him . The Admiral sinks back into the chair .
PHOTOGRAPHER: Closer , ladies ! Closer ! Now smile ! Great ! Next week I 'll show you a print and you can order your Pictures of Paradise !
BETTY: Barbara , here 's yoursand Evelyn , here you are .
BARBARA: What is it with nurses and pilots ?
COLONEL: You 're Walker , right ?
DANNY: Yes Sir .
COLONEL: That was a nice little stunt you pulled , uzzing the base .
DANNY: You liked that ?
COLONEL: Oh yeah . I liked it so much I 'm cutting you out of the squadron .
DANNY: Sir ?
COLONEL: I do n't buy that hot dog shit . So you and your buddies are gon na transfer you planes up to Haleiwa .
DANNY: Hale-what ?
COLONEL: You 'll love it . No base , no bars , just lots of sun and aircraft maintenance .
DANNY: Sir , I
COLONEL: Too late for apologies , Walker .
DANNY: I was n't gon na apologize , Sir . I was just gon na say it was worth it to feel like a real pilot again , even if it was only for five seconds . The Colonel glares at him and stalks away .
EVELYN: We got some soldiers in traction from a jeep accident , but it 's quiet . Except for the occasional fighter plane buzzing us .
DANNY: That might not have been such a good idea . They 're making us fly out of a half-paved airfield . The real punishment is that I wo n't be back to the barracks till it 's too late for dinner or coffee . So I guess it 's goodbye for awhile .
EVELYN: I was just thinking that war is a series of goodbyes . Do you think that 's why we 're meeting . To help us say goodbye to Rafe ?
DANNY: I swore not to talk about him tonight , ut there 's all this stuff I think I ought to tell you , that he did n't get a chance to . Rafe washe was lonely . He had such high expectations of himself that he always felt empty . The week he met you he told me he felt his heart had always lived in winter , and for the first time in his life he has seen the spring .
EVELYN: He told me he did n't want to leave me with regret . Now that 's all I have .
DANNY: Hey , have you seen Pearl Harbor at night ?
EVELYN: Wellsure .
DANNY: From the air ?
EVELYN: So beautiful !
DANNY: Hang on .
EVELYN: I did n't realize until tonight that I 've stopped wanting to live .
EVELYN'S VOICE: Dearest Rafe
MESSAGE BOY: Daniel Walker ?
DANNY: Rafe !
RAFE: Evelyn .
EVELYN: Why were you sitting here , instead of
RAFE: I saw you , I could n't go in , Ijust stood there wondering if you knew . You lookedsad , and I had to sit down a minute .
EVELYN: How did you ?
RAFE: Survive ? I jumped in a patch of fog , and nobody could see me . I hit the wate hard . And it was socold .
EVELYN: I 'm justso amazed , so glad to know that you 're okay . You are okay , are n't you ?
RAFE: Nothing that wo n't heal . I guess .
EVELYN: It 's beenso different , being so sure you were dead .
RAFE: I 'm so sorry for what you must 've gone through , but I 'm back . He sees the troubled look on her face .
EVELYN: It 's not your fault , Rafe . The letter I wrote you , they
RAFE: Do n't worry about that . Guys away from home , lonely , good-hearted women try to cheer them up .
EVELYN: It 's not that I did n't mean everything I wrote . It 's just that I thought you were dead . And now Danny runs up , through the darkness .
DANNY: You 're alive !
RAFE: Aw , God . Oh my God .
EVELYN: Rafe
RAFE: Evelyn
DANNY: Do n't worry . I 'll find him .
BETTY: This came while you were gone .
DANNY: You 'd always go sit in a plane wheneve you were upset .
RAFE: Upset ? Why should I be upset ?
DANNY: Let 's go get a drink . Unless you 're scared to talk about it .
ANTHONY: Rafe ? ! They rush the table
RAFE: They 'll go under you because their planes are faster , then they run so you ca n't catch 'em . But then they 'll come around and take you from behind like some Americans will .
DANNY: Why be sorry ? That 's what you feel , it 's etter to come out with it .
RAFE: I did n't mean it .
DANNY: Sure you did . So come on . Say what you think .
RAFE: Waitress ! Four beers !
DANNY: You do n't wan na put beer over mai-tai .
RAFE: If you ca n't keep up , do n't drink yours .
DANNY: What facts are those ?
RAFE: I understand how it could happen . I know why any guy would love her . And I ca n't lame you that it happened . You thought I was dead , she was grieving , you were trying to help her .
DANNY: I was grieving too .
RAFE: Yeah , right . Anyway , you did n't know .
DANNY: So what are you saying ?
RAFE: I 'm saying now you do know . So it 's time for you to fuck off .

SELFRIDGE CAPTAIN: How big ?
SONAR OPERATOR: I 've lost it .
SELFRIDGE CAPTAIN: Probably a blackfish . I 've seen them look like subs .
DUTY OFFICER: Sir , Selfridge reports a contact , then lost it . Now our sonar reports the contact .
RAFE: How come you 're not pukin ' ?
DANNY: I guess I 'm used to it . I 've felt like throwing up every minute since you got ack .
RAFE: Fuck you .
DANNY: She loves you . I know that . And part of what she loves in me is how much of you she sees in me .
RAFE: How sweet . Is that when you put the move on her ?
SUB COMMANDER: Prepare to launch midget sub .
LOOKOUT: Captain , do you see that , in our wake ?

ELLIS: All right , Sir . They say do n't worry about it .
YAMAMOTO: We have achieved surprise , but thei carriers are not in port . I do n't like this .
GENDA: We have a fighter screen up , in case we are attacked , Admiral .
YAMAMOTO: We must go ahead . This is our moment .
LIEUTENANT: Admiral , one of our destroyers reports sinking a sub on its way into Pearl .

GENERAL SHORT: Mobilize everything ! We 're at war ! Send a message to Washington Hostilities with Japan commenced with an air raid on Pearl Harbor .
HOPKINS: Oval Room Yes , he is . It 's Knox , Mr. President .
ROOSEVELT: Yes ?
HOPKINS: My God . Do we have damage estimates ?
ROOSEVELT: Our Pacific Fleet , at anchor , unprepared ? It 's terrible . It has to be . And it 's not over .
DANNY: We need ammo too ! Earl shouts instructions to the pilots .
EARL: Strip it from the wrecks !
DANNY: He did .
SHIMAZAKI: Second wave , deploy over the military ases . High level bombers to the ai stations , dive bombers attack ships in harbor . Fighters strafe and cover .

ORDERLY: Insecticide ?
EVELYN: No , just the sprayers . We 'll fill them with tannic acid , it 'll sterilize them and cool the burns ! GO !
GENDA: We have achieved complete surprise ! The first wave is returning , the second is attacking now , and we have lost only a few planes . We can launch a third wave , Admiral .
YAMAMOTO: The second wave has not returned . And we have no idea where their carriers are . What is the damage report ?
COMMUNICATIONS OFFICER: We have Commander Fuchida on the radio now , Admiral .
FUCHIDA'S VOICE: I am over the harbor now
FUCHIDA: We have a tremendous victory . Many ships damaged , some totally destroyed . But the Second Wave 's attack is being hindered by the smoke .
YAMAMOTO: The more we attack , the harder it is to find targets . And we no longer have surprise .
GENDA: If we launch the third wave and annihilate their fuel depots , we destroy their ability to operate in the Pacific for at least a year !
YAMAMOTO: And if we fail , and lose our carriers , we destroy our ability to fight them at all . As soon as the second wave returns , we will withdraw .
CONSCIOUS SOLDIER: Sarge ? ! Where are you , Sarge ?

SAILOR FLASHLIGHT: Just hand on . They 'll find us .
SAILOR: How do you know ?
SAILOR FLASHLIGHT: Because we would find them . He switches the light off again .
SAILOR: You hear something ?
ROOSEVELT: Yesterday , December 7 , 1941 a date which will live in infamy the United States of American was suddenly and deliberately attacked by naval and ai forces of the Empire of Japan .
ROOSEVELT'S VOICE: Warwarwar
ROOSEVELT: Gentlemen , the crisis we face is not the fact that our enemies believe they can defeat us it 's the fact that our people elieve it too . I want a plan a workable plan to hit the heart of Japan , to bomb them the way they have ombed us .
ADMIRAL: Mr. President , Pearl Harbor caught us ecause we did n't face facts . This is n't a time for ignoring them again . There are no planes in the entire American arsenal capable of covering the distance to Japan from any land base we control while carrying enough bombs to do any damage whatsoever .
GENERAL MARSHALL: He 's right , Mr. President . The Army has long range bombers , but no place to launch them from . Midway 's too far , China is overrun by Japanese forces , and Russia refuses to go to war with Japan and wo n't allow us to launch a raid from there .
ADMIRAL: The navy 's planes are small , carry light loads , and have short range . We would have to get them within a few hundred miles of Japan , and therefore risk ou carriers . And if we lose our carriers , we have no shield against invasion .
ROOSEVELT: What if the Japanese did invade ?
GENERAL MARSHALL: We 've done studies . We 're confident we would turn them back eventuallyafte they 'd gotten as far as Chicago .
ADMIRAL: Mr. Presidentwith all respectwhat you are asking ca n't be done .
ROOSEVELT: Do not tell meit ca n't be done .
MINISTER: Where is God in this ? Our enemies elieve a divine wind protects them . We see our friends laid out before us , and find it hard to believe in anything at all .
EVELYN: Rafe
RAFE: I need to tell you something . I did n't know what it was to lose somebody , to see death and find how much it scares you . That you have n't lived and loved enough . I did n't understand . Forgive me .
EVELYN: Rafe No . You forgive me .
RAFE: Of course I forgive you . I know what you feel for Danny is real . And your choice is your choice .
EVELYN: That 's what I have to tell you , Rafe . It was n't a choice . It An Army Corps MAJOR steps up and interrupts .
MAJOR: Lieutenant Rafe McCawley ?
RAFE: Yes , Major .
MAJOR: Lieutenant Daniel Walker here too ? Danny sees him and moves up .
DANNY: I 'm Walker .
MAJOR: You 're going Stateside . We fly out in half an hour . He hands them both orders .
RAFE: What for , Sir ?
MAJOR: Ask Colonel Doolittle . Those orders are from him .
DANNY: I told her not to come .
DOOLITTLE: I heard what you did .
RAFE: We can explain , Colonel .
DOOLITTLE: Explain what ?
DANNY: Whatever is was you heard about us .
DOOLITTLE: You mean the hula shirts you were flying in ? Or the six planes you shot down ? You 're both being awarded the Silve Star , and promoted to captain .
RAFE: Is that the good new , Sir , or
DOOLITTLE: You 're just about the only pilots in the Army with actual combat experience , so you 're volunteering for a mission I 've een ordered to put together . Do you know what top secret is ?
RAFE: Well sure , Colonel
DOOLITTLE: Top secret means you help me pick the other pilots , train , and go without knowing where you 're going until it 's too late .
DANNY: You can count on us .
DOOLITTLE: There 's only one other thing I can tell you .
VOICE: Attention !
DOOLITTLE: Be seated . The mission you 've volunteered for is dangerous . How dangerous ? Look at the man beside you . It 's a good bet that six weeks from now , either you or he will be dead . Danny and Rafe whisper to each other
DANNY: Sorry you 're gon na die cause I 'm gon na make it .
RAFE: What color flowers you want me to bring to your funeral ?
DOOLITTLE: In flight school you qualified in single and in multi-engine planes . You 'll be flying multi-engines here .
RAFE: Bombers .
DOOLITTLE: I want to introduce a couple of people . Doc White is a flight surgeon ; he has volunteered for gunnery training so that he can go on the mission , because we ca n't spare the weight of an extra man .
DANNY: A long range bomber mission .
DOOLITTLE: And Ross Greening , who will oversee your equipment . Any questions ?
DANNY: Who 'll be the first one in , Colonel ? I 'd like to volunt
DOOLITTLE: I thought I 'd made it clear , I 'm not just putting this mission together I 'm leading it myself .
RAFE: I take it back , about the flowers . We 're all gon na die .
DOOLITTLE: This is what we 'll fly the B-25 . There 's one thing you have to be aware of from the very beginning . You see that private ?
GREENING: Okay , forty pounds gone . And in it 's place , this .
DOOLITTLE: Does it work ?
DANNY: Fun today . Like old times .
RAFE: Danny , what the hell are you trying to do out there ?
DANNY: What do you mean ? I 'm just doing what we 've always done .
RAFE: No . You 're trying to beat me .
DANNY: We 've always tried to beat each other .
RAFE: Bullshit . We 've played with each other , pushed each other . This is different . Like you want to prove that you 're etter than me . Who 's that for Evelyn ?
DANNY: Maybe just trying to measure up .
RAFE: What 's between you and her is between you and her . But here 's what 's between you and me . Everybody has a hero , Danny . And you 're mine . Danny 's caught off-guard .
ROOSEVELT'S VOICE: Good evening , America
RED: N-naval station ? What 's g-going on ?
RAFE: Wish I knew , Red .
DOOLITTLE: Want to see where they 're going ?
ANTHONY: I guess that settles it . Somewhere in the Pacific .
RED: With a s-short r-runway .
DOOLITTLE: You have rooms at the Biltmore . I suggest a nice meal and a good night 's sleep . We leave tomorrow . Doolittle walks to join a captain .
ANTHONY: San Francisco , here we are !
DANNY: I do n't reckon we can get hogbrains and grits , but I hear a man can eat good in this town .
RAFE: I 'm gon na turn in . I hate being on the water . I think this is the last sleep I 'll get for awhile .
MANAGER: Have fun .
RAFE: What ?
EVELYN: They were bringing back a ship full of wounded and needed extra nurses along . I wrote Colonel Doolittle , and told him I needed to see you before you go .
RAFE: It must of been a convincing letter .
EVELYN: It was . I could n't have you go away , wherever it isto warwithout knowing something . You think I made a choice , of Danny over you . I did n't . I did n't have a choice . I 'm pregnant .
RAFE: Does Danny know ? She shakes her head , refuses to cry .
EVELYN: I was n't sure , until the day you turned up alive . I never had a chance to tell him . Now I ca n't have him thinking about this when he needs to be thinking about his mission , and how to come back from it . She turns and faces him again .
DOOLITTLE: Gentlemen , I can now tell you that the target of this mission is Tokyo .
RED: And where 's the secret base , Sir ? The one we t-takeoff from .
DOOLITTLE: The navy will get us to within 400 miles of the Japanese coast . We 'll launch off the carriers from there .
ANTHONY: Sir , has this ever been done , launching an army bomber off a navy carrier ?
DOOLITTLE: No . Any other questions ?
RED: C-Colonel , we been p-practicing takeoff 's , but I ai n't sure we can land on these carriers d-decks .
DOOLITTLE: We wo n't have the fuel to get back to the carriers ; they 'll turn and run back to Hawaii the minute we 're airborne .
RED: Then wh-where do we land ?
DOOLITTLE: I have a phrase I want you all to memorize `` Lushu hoo megwa fugi . '' It means `` I am an American . '' In Chinese . Absolute silence among the pilots .
RED: A-a-asshole ! Maybe it 's l-longe going this way .
DANNY: It 's shorter than our practice runway .
RAFE: They 'll turn the ship into the wind efore we launch . That 'll help .
DANNY: We 'll be loaded with 2,000 pounds of ombs and 1,500 pounds of fuel . I got another Chinese phrase for Doolittle . `` Mug wump rickshaw mushu pork . '' It means `` Who the fuck thought up this shit ? '' Doolittle appears right beside them .
DOOLITTLE: He was a navy man . Doolittle walks away .
RAFE: Maybe we 'll be lucky with the weather .
DOOLITTLE: Since we 'll be on our own once we 're in the air , I thought I had a good idea letting each crew select it 's own target .
RED: I d-do n't think Japs ought ' a be allowed to p-play baseball .
DOOLITTLE: I 'd like to bomb their Emperor too . But I think that 'd just piss 'em off . The idea here , Gentlemen , is not revenge . We 're here to prove to them that they 're neither invincible nor superior . So let 's try this again . Military targets only .
RED: Colonel , to f-fight you need strategy . To have strategy , ya got ta practice . And to practice it , ya got ta play
DOOLITTLE: No baseball diamonds , Red .
RED: Y-Yes Sir .
ADMIRAL: The Enterprise will ride shotgun when we launch the bombers . They wanted ou carriers at Pearl , and now we 've come to them . If the Japanese get us , they 'll be having dinner in San Francisco next month .
RAFE: It 's not getting any longer .
DANNY: Longer ? It 's getting shorter .
DOOLITTLE: We 'll take off late this afternoon . I 'll hit Tokyo at dusk , and drop incendiary ombs . You 'll come after me at night , guided by the fires . Then it 's on to China , where you 'll arrive at dawn , guided to their airfields by the homing eacons the Chinese are going to switch on for us . That 's if everything is perfect like every other military mission I 've ever been involved with .
RAFE: Colonelwe 're all going . Whether you make it or not .
DOOLITTLE: I know .
OFFICER: Sir , lookouts on the cruisers report patrol boats , ten miles away !
HALSEY: The Japs have set up a picket line ! Order the cruisers to open fire ! We 've got to sink them before they get a message away .
RADIO OPERATOR: They 've reported our position ! Tell the Admiral .
DOOLITTLE: How far are we from Tokyo ?
ADMIRAL: Seven hundred miles .
LOUDSPEAKER: Army pilots , man your planes !
DOOLITTLE: Load in every bit of extra gas you can carry ! And strip everything you do n't need out of the planes . I mean
DANNY: Broomsticks instead of tail guns .
RAFE: We 'll get separated over the target , but you and I will rendezvous for the run to China . I 'm on your wing .
DANNY: And I 'm on yours . Land of the free .
RAFE: Home of the Brave . They climb into their bombers .
HALSEY: Of all the other things this mission is doing that have never been done before I 've never sent out planes that I was n't going to see safely home . Let 's get out of here . The task force runs for home .
RAFE: What 's our ETA for Tokyo ?
NAVIGATOR: Almost exactly at 12 noon .
RED: High n-noon . I k-kinda like that .
DANNY: We got a 25-mile-an-hour head wind . How we doing with fuel ?
GUNNER: How do you think ?
DOOLITTLE'S NAVIGATOR: Time for the others to break off .
SUPERVISOR: From the sea ? That could n't be right , it must be part of the air raid practice this morning .
COMA: Listen to this it 's Tokyo Rose .
ANTHONY: We 'll give that bitch something to announce .
JAPANESE MOTHER: Yes ! So beautiful !
RAFE: Open bomb bay doors . DANNY 'S PLANE runs toward its target DOOLITTLE 'S PLANE races over Tokyo
GUNNER: Bomb bay doors open , sir .
RAFE: It 's all yours .
EMPEROR'S ATTENDANT: Surely just a drill , Divine One .
NAVIGATOR: Last bomb away .
GUNNER: We got Zeros ! And they 're pissed off ! Rafe changes course quickly .
RAFE: Can you get 'em off us ?
RED: Whatta ya want me to do , sweep 'em !
RAFE: Danny , get the hell out of here !
ANTHONY: `` How 's your fuel ? ''
GENERAL MARSHALL: We have bombed Tokyo , Mr. President . Radio Tokyo interrupted it 's own oadcast to make the announcement .
ROOSEVELT: Have the planes made it to China ?
GENERAL MARSHALL: There 've been some complications , Sir . The Chinese did n't receive our request for homing beacons until is was too late to get them set . And the planes had to take off so early they may lack fuel to make the mainland anyway .
ROOSEVELT: So those brave men are flying blind and unning out of fuel .
GENERAL MARSHALL: The Chinese are sending out search parties to try to find the crews before the Jap patrols do , if any of the planes make it .
ROOSEVELT: God help them .
DOOLITTLE: We 'll fly till we run out of fuel , then ail out . Just then his engines start to sputter .
COMA: We 're running out of fuel . And I ca n't find the beacon .
RAFE: I do n't know if we 're over sea or land . Drop flares and try to spot something .
DANNY: Flash Rafe . We 're gon na bail . Red sees Anthony signal .
RED: They 've got ta jump .
RAFE: Not unless we know he 's over land ! Rafe yells at Danny , as if he could hear
RAFE'S NAVIGATOR: Coastline below !
RAFE: We 've got coast ! Signal him to climb and jump . Red signals ; Danny 's plane signals back .
RED: They do n't have fuel to make altitude . He 's gon na set it down in the water .
RAFE: N-O ! We stay together ! I 'll go in first .
DANNY: I 've made better landings .
RAFE: You hang on , Danny ! You hang on ! You 're gon na make it !
DANNY: I ca n't make it .
RAFE: Yes you can .
DANNY: Take care of Evelyn .
RAFE: I will . And your baby . You 're gon na be a father .
DANNY: No . You are .
RAFE: Danny Land of the free Land of the free
VOICE OVER: The Doolittle Raid was the pivotal moment of America 's war with Japan . Before it , America knew nothing but defeat ; afte it , nothing but victory . One crew of Doolittle 's raiders made it to Vladivostok , Russia , where they were interred for much of the war . Thirteen planes crash landed in China , where the Chinese people helped the Americans escape , and had their villages destroyed and citizens executed by the Japanese forces of occupation . Two crews were captured by the Japanese and three fliers were executed without trial , called `` wa criminals '' by the Japanese . Jimmy Doolittle was promoted to General , and given the medal of honor .

NANCY: Look at Kenny Rossi . Is n't he dreamy ? I wish he 'd break up with Arlene . She thinks she 's so great .
PEGGY: Do n't eat the red ones .
NANCY: Why not ? They 're my favorite .
PEGGY: They 're bad for you . They causered lips .
PEGGY: Ca n't hurt . I 'm already dead . She belts down several drinks .
MRS. KELCHER: I put your laundry on your beds . Do n't forget to put it away .
NANCY: What 's for dinner ?
MRS. KELCHER: Meatloaf .
NANCY: Yeech , not again .
MR. KELCHER: Girls ? Evelyn ? Who left this thing outside ? He turns and heads back outside .
MRS. KELCHER: What is it ?
MR. KELCHER: What do you think ?
NANCY: Like wow ! Wait till I tell Diane . She 's always bragging about he father 's Cadillac .
MR. KELCHER: Peggy Sue , what do you think ?
PEGGY: Oh , Daddy . You were always doing things like that . That 's funny ! That 's really funny .
MR. KELCHER: Young lady , you 're drunk !
PEGGY: Just a little . I 've had a tough day .
MR. KELCHER: I do n't see the humor in this . Go to your room immediately . You 're grounded .
PEGGY: Grounded ? Ha ! The story of my life . I do n't wan na go to my room . I wan na import Japanese cars . I wan na go to Liverpool and discover the Beatles .
MRS. KELCHER: Jack , take it easy . She gave blood at school today . Maybe she 's just a little light—headed .
MR. KELCHER: This is not giving blood . This is drunk .
PEGGY: Dad , I never knew you had a sense of humor .
MR. KELCHER: Evelyn , put her to bed .
MRS. KELCHER: My little baby . Do n't try to grow up so fast .
PEGGY: Oh Mom , I forgot you were ever so young .
NANCY: Can I borrow this sweater ?
PEGGY~: Yeah , but take good care of it . I 'm saving it for my daughter.. She loves this stuff .
MRS. KELCHER: What happened to your hair ? You have such a pretty face . Why are you always trying to cover it up ?
PEGGY: Oh . I forgot .
MRS. KELCHER: You 're looking pretty chipper this morning .
PEGGY: I 'm still here , are n't I ? I may as well enjoy myself . I 'm going to go to school today . Dad , I want to apologize fo yesterday . The car is a classic . Use it in the best of health .
MR. KELCHER: Thank you.. I accept you apology with the hope that what went on yesterday will neve happen again .
PEGGY: That would be impossible .
MR. KELCHER: You 're so young , this is not the time to start acquiring bad habits .
PEGGY: Mom , is there any coffee left ?
MRS. KELCHER: When did you start drinking coffee ?
PEGGY: Oh . Ahrecently . All the kids drink it .
MR. KELCHER: If all the kids jumped off a idge , would you do that too ?
PEGGY: I think I 'm way ahead of them .
NANCY: Pass the toast , please . Peggy passes Nancy the toast .
PEGGY: You know , you two are wonderful parents . I 'm really going to try to ehave myself .

NANCY: DADDY—o .
PEGGY: Mom , sit down for a minute . This is so nice , all of us being togethe again like this .
NANCY: Can I tell Diane that Peggy Sue got drunk or is that a deep family secret ? Well ?
MRS. KELCHER: How does Diane like her braces ?
R31.NCY: She hates them . Nobody likes aces . Thy just call you junkyard face and Miss Metal Mouth . I got ta go .
PEGGY: Oh yeah . Charlie . How am I going to handle him ?
MRS. KELCHER: What 's the matter ? Did you two have a fight ? .
PEGGY: Sort of .
MRS. KELCHER: What about ?
PEGGY: The house payments .
CHARLIE: How do you feel ?
PEGGY: Pretty strange .
CHARLIE: Come on . Get in . I can take care of that .
PEGGY: Not now , Charlie . I 've got a headache . Get used to the word . Roll it around your tongue for a years .
CHARLIE: Hey , I can take a hint . You look great today .
PEGGY: You drive like a maniac !
CHARLIE: I call this the staccato .
PEGGY: Oh yeah ?
CHARLIE: You know . About what we said on Tuesday . It makes a lot of sense .
PEGGY: Refresh my memory .
CHARLIE: How could you forget ? We talk about seeing other people and you forget ?
PEGGY: Maybe I blocked it out .
CHARLIE: I can understand that.. But please do n't start crying again .
PEGGY: Why wait ?
CHARLIE: Well , we got the prom coming up , all these parties . We should n't upset our parents ?
PEGGY: They 'll learn to live with it .
CHARLIE: You 're more shook up than you want to admit . You 'll get used to it , we 'll still see each other 2 , 3 times a week .
PEGGY: Would you ?
CHARLIE: Would I ? ! ! Why I oughta
PEGGY: Where 's Rosalie Testa ?
CAROL: Probably at the diving meet .
DOLORES: Did you study for the test ?
PEGGY: Test ?
SNELGROVE: All right , class . Time 's up .
PEGGY: Mr. Snelgrove , I happen to know that in the future , I will neve have the slightest use for algebra . And I speak from experience .
MICHAEL: Santiago comes back , with nothing — there 's no meat on the bone . It 's Hemingway 's ego defending itself again ; he 's trying to prove he can still perform .
GILFOND: What Hemingway 's saying , Michael , is that we are alone — that when we go out too far we 're vulnerable . The irony , that Santiago is beaten by the sharks , does n't make him less of a hero . THE BELL RINGS . The class begins to exit .
PEGGY: Mr. Gilfond , can I talk to you ?
GILFOND: Sure , Peggy Sue . What 's on you mind ?
PEGGY: I just wanted to tell you how much I enjoy your class . You taught me a lot and you 're a very fine teacher .
GILFOND: That 's very kind of you . Thank you .
PEGGY: Thank you . Um , I also think you 're underpaid .
WALTER: Why does your father take inventory on Sunday night ? That 's poke night . You always got out of it efore .
CHARLIE: I 've got to string him along for a while . It 's for his own good .
ARTHUR: But you 're not going into his usiness . When 're you going to tell him ?
CHARLIE: Soon . I ca n't tall everybody everything all at once .
WALTER: Strange rumors are sweeping the school about you .
PEGGY: What do you mean ?
WALTER: Prom what I hear , you really gave it to old Smellgrove .
MADDY: I was there . She told the creep off ight to his face .
ARTHUR: Atta girl , Peg .
PEGGY: Arthur , please do n't call me Peg .
ARTHUR: Why I oughta Charlie , Walter and Arthur crack up .
PEGGY: I do n't get it .
CAROL: That 's because you ' re not a total moron like they are .
MADDY: It 's some stupid old movie thing they just started .
WALTER: That 's enough out of you , little lady .
CHARLIE: I 'll throw the book at you !
ARTHUR: Why I oughta
PEGGY: I 'll be right back .
WALTER: She 's not wasting any time . Peggy Sue and Mr. Square Root ?
CHARLIE: He 's a nice guy . You know he 's writing a book ?
WALTER: Oh , a book Excuse me for a second .
PEGGY: Congratulations on the math contest , Richard .
RICHARD: It really was n't that difficult .
DOUG: What 're you doing , Peggy Sue ? Fishing for four—eyed worms ?
PEGGY: Get lost you macho shmuck . Doug and Richard react .
RICHARD: I 'm not doing any tutoring this year . I 'm too busy .
PEGGY: It 's not that . Can we meet afte school ? Please ?
RICHARD: All right . I 'll be in the physics lab . Make it four—thirty . I have a ocket club meeting .
MADDY: Therefore , the key to a successful children 's party can be summed up in one word — planning.. With proper planning , a successful , inexpensive happy birthday party can be had by all . Including the mother . She walks back to her seat .
MISS OTTO: That was very comprehensive , Madeline . Thank you.. Now Peggy Sue , your topic was 'How To Choose A Nursery School . ' Are you prepared ?
PEGGY: All . Okay . Sure .
DOLORES: What a girl . What a twirl . You know , Peg—Leggy , you 're gon na get demoted to hall monitor -
HEAD MAJORETTE: Come on , Peggy Sue.. Try it again . You have n't been practicing .
CHARLIE: Looking good out there .
PEGGY: Thanks .
CHARLIE: I noticed you were giving me the silent treatment at lunch . I guess I deserved it . I 've been thinking about my three year plan and I think it 's unworkable . I must have een delirious .
PEGGY: I thought it had a lot of merit .
CHARLIE: In the abstract maybe . Get a grip on yourself ! But when I imagine you going out with other guys , I feel ah
PEGGY: Rejected , worthless , miserable .
CHARLIE: Yeah . Like that .
PEGGY: Good .
RICHARD: I 'm writing a book on kite construction . What did you want to talk about ?
PEGGY: I want to ask you a question . Do you thinktime travel is possible ?
RICHARD: Are you doing some kind of science project ?
PEGGY: Sort of .
RICHARD: Well in a Newtonian framework , the possibilities were limited , but with the advent of relativity theory , the idea of absolute time can no longer be reasonably affirmed . Peggy has n't understood a word .
PEGGY: What 's that ?
RICHARD: That 's my own theory based on a Mexican food called the burrito . I had it once when my parents took me to Disneyland .
PEGGY: I know what a burrito is .
RICHARD: Well , I think time is like a urrito . Sometimes it just folds over on itself and one part touches the other .
PEGGY: What 's inside ?
RICHARD: You can till it with whatever you want . From illusions to memory , from experience to innocence , from happiness to the entire universes
PEGGY: So you think time travel is possible ? For people ?
RICHARD: Absolutely . People , dogs , elephants .
PEGGY: Listen , you 've got ta keep this a secret . You ca n't tell a soul . Promise ?
RICHARD: Okay . I promise .
PEGGY: This is serious . Nobody can know . Ah , I 've returned from the future . I traveled back here 25 years .
RICHARD: You probably are crazy . Wait a minute . Is this some kind of joke ? I know what you all , think of me .
PEGGY: You have a blind grandfather . One day you 're going to invent a machine that reads books for blind people . I read about it . You 're going to be famous . You 're going to invent a lot of things .
RICHARD: How , did you know about my grandfather ?
PEGGY: Because I 'm telling you the truth . I know what 's going to happen . There 's going to be test tube abies and heart transplants . And an American named Neil Armstrong is going to walk on the moon . On July
RICHARD: Holy Toledo ! That 's six years ahead of schedule !
PEGGY: I do n't know .
RICHARD: I 'd be very careful if I were you . You don ' t want to fall into the clutches of some madman with plans to manipulate your brain .
PEGGY: That 's why I was getting a divorce.. What I really think is that I had a heart attack at the reunion and died .
RICHARD: You look pretty good for a corpse .
PEGGY: Come on , Richard , I 'm serious .
RICHARD: You 're giving me the creeps .
PEGGY: Am I dead or not ?
RICHARD: There 's one way to find out .
PEGGY: What 're you doing ?
RICHARD: Confucious says , The way out is through the door . There 's a truck . There 's your door . A large truck speeds towards them .
PEGGY: No ! I do n't want to die !
RICHARD: Okay , you 're not dead , but according to every law of science what you say happened to you is impossible .
PEGGY: What if it 's beyond science ? What it it 's God ?
RI CHARD: Einstein said `` God does n't play dice with the universe . '' I 'm a scientist . I believe that there 's an order to things . Why would God ing you back as a high school girl ?
PEGGY: I do n't know .
RICHARD: You 're a molecule in chaos , a discontinuent aberration . Maybe you 've just got powers of precognition . Well , maybe you 're just out of whack .
PEGGY: I told you , I 've already lived my life . I do n't know how or why I 'm here , but you have to help me get ack . I want to get back to my real life !
RICHARD: All right , I 'll work on it , I 'll , do some research . But in the meantime , do n't get crazy .
PEGGY: I 'm trying . I 'll see you tomorrow .
RICHARD: What if you 're not here tomorrow ?
PEGGY: Who was that man ?
MRS. KELCHER: It was nobody . Ah he 's a poll , taker . I 'm thinking of voting Democrat this year . But do n't mention it to your father . How was school today ?
PEGGY: It was great to see everybody again . But it 's so boring and egimented . Most of what they teach is useless . The worst thing was lunch . The TELEPHONE RINGS .
MRS. KELCHER: Would you get that , dear ?
PEGGY: Sure , Mom . Hello . Peggy gasps . Mrs. Kelcher turns to her .
MRS. KELCHER: Peggy ! What 's the matter ? Who is it ?
PEGGY: It 's Grandma . I ca n't talk to he now . I 'm sorry , Grandma .
MRS. KELCHER: What happened to you ?
PEGGY: I had a dream that Grandma died .
MRS. KELCHER: Well , she is getting on , but she 's fine . I told her you were n't feeling well yesterday . She called to find out how you are .
PEGGY: She did ? I love her so much , and I have n't seen her in such a long time . And Grandpa Barney . Is he all , right ?
MRS. KELCHER: Yes , he 's fine , too . You saw them at Easter .
PEGGY: I 'm sorry , Mom . I 'll call Grandma ack and apologize .
MRS. KELCHER: That 's a good girl I hate to see you so upset . Tell me , sweetheart . Are you having problems with Charlie ? You mentioned something this morning .
PEGGY: I 'm confused about a lot of things ight now . Charlie 's only one of them . Two beats .
MRS. KELCHER: Is Charlie pressuring you to do things you do n't think you should e doing ?
PEGGY: What do you mean ?
MRS. KELCHER: Peggy , do you know what a penis is ? Stay away from it .
MR. KELCHER: Hello , Charlie .
CHARLIE: Hello , sir . How are things at the hat store ?
MR. KELCHER: Fine , thanks . Come on in . I want to talk to you .
NANCY: She 's distorted .
CHARLIE: Yes , sir .
MR. KELCHER: She seems confused , irresponsible , overemotional . My wife says that 's the way girls act sometimes .
NANCY: She 's almost a juvenile delinquent .
CHARLIE: Yes , sir . But that 's what I like about her . She 's not like all the other girls at school .
MR. KELCHER: Charles , in spite of you adolescent infatuation with music , we 've always regarded you a a fine young man . We 've trusted you with our daughter .
CHARLIE: Yes , sir . Trust is a two—way street . In the past two years I 've een pleased to note that you and Mrs. Kelcher have , uh , fulfilled your sacred trust of being good parents to the , uh , woman I plan to take off your hands .
PEGGY: Oh , Beth .
MRS. KELCHER: Charlie 's downstairs . Why are n't you ready ?
PEGGY: For what ?
MRS. KELCHER: Maddy 's party .
PEGGY: I do n't feel very festive .
MRS. KELCHER: You accepted an invitation , Maddy 's one of your best friends , and I aked the Rice Krispie squares . Peggy laughs .
MR. KELCHER: We think this party might chee her up . Just make sure you know what 's expected of you .
CHARLIE: What would that be , sir ?
MR. KELCHER: Show her a good time , but for God 's sake restrain yourself .
CHARLIE: Of course .
PEGGY: Where did you get that sweater ?
CHARLIE: Great , is n't it ?
PEGGY: It 's really Fifties . You sort of clash with the world .
CHARLIE: Hey ! What 's the fun of being a teenager if you ca n't dress weird ? And we 're going to have fun tonight , right ?
PEGGY: Right . I promised my mother .
CHARLIE: Is this slow enough for you ?
PEGGY: Charlie , how are you ?
CHARLIE: I 'm fine Peggy Sue . And how are you ? Are we talking on the phone ? Are we pen pals ?
PEGGY: Seriously . What 's it like to be eighteen ?
CHARLIE: It 's great . I cleaned the car , do you like it ? Oh , I got tickets fo Fabian on your birthday , you like him , right ? He 's cool . Eighteen is half of thirty six . It 's `` Gentlemen start your engines '' , vroom , like I 'm gassed up ready for the race . I 've got the girl , I 've got the car , I 've got the talent , but I do n't know . Do I date , get married , join the army , cut a record , go to college ? I got a million choices , ut nobody teaches you how to choose . But it 's different for a girl . You 're Lucky . You just have to wait for me .
DOUG: Gol'darnit , dag nab it , dad burn it , dad blame it .
CHARLIE: Here comes the life of the party .
LEON: Goes down , smooth . Hey , look what the cat dragged in .
CHARLIE: Have no fear . Charlie 's here .
WALTER: Oh , it 's you is it .
TERRY: Jumping Jehosophat !
DOUG: It 's a miracle !
PEGGY: Hi , guys .
ARTHUR: Now that 's a purty little heifer .
CHARLIE: Why Pete 's the best darn cook on the Panhandle !
PEGGY: Why I oughta ! The boys all crack up .
CHARLIE: Ready . Set . Go -
ARTHUR: Hi—Yo Silver ! A cloud of dust , a galloping horse with the speed of light , a hearty Hi-Yo Silver ! The Lone Ranger ! With his faithful Indian companion Tonto , the daring and resourceful Masked Rider of the Plains came to Earth with powers- and abilities far beyond those of mortal men . Return with us now to those thrilling days of yesteryear - from out of the
LEON: You doorknob ! You threw in Superman !
CHARLIE: Too bad . Close to a record .
ARTHUR: I hate it when the beer comes out my nose .
MADDY: Can you believe I want to marry that dork .
CAROL: Why do guys do such stupid things ?
PEGGY: You know , I never could figure that one out .
MADDY: I was thinking of four ushers and four bridesmaids .
WALTER: The Yanks got the hitting but the Sox got the defense .
CAROL: What are your colors , going to be ?
ARTHUR: I'l1 take Kubek and Richardson over Fox and Aparicio .
MADDY: I 'm thinking of pink and green .
CHARLIE: Pitching wins pennants . The Tigers got four potential twenty game winners .
CAROL: You 'd be surprised at how many girls in school are n't virgins .
CHARLIE: Don Mossi , Frank Lary , Jim Sunning and Paul Foytack .
ARTHUR: And now , direct from three weeks of ehearsal in Walter 's garage , fou guys who have dedicated their lives to becoming the greatest singing group in the world Charlie , Walter , Leon and Terry . The Definitions .
CHARLIE: One , two , three-
CAROL: Charlie really has a great voice .
MADDY: Maybe they 'll be the next Dion and the Belmonts .
PEGGY: Do n't get your hopes up .
MADDY: Come on , where 's your enthusiasm ?
PEGGY: He is kind of cute , is n't he ?
CAROL: Yeah . You 're so lucky . He really loves you , too . He 's always telling Walter how wonderful you are .
PEGGY: He does ?
DOLORES: Carol and I saw you with that creep , Richard , today .
PEGGY: First of all , Richard is not a creep . He happens to be an exceptional person . If any of you gave him half a chance , you 'd find that out .
DOLORES: God , Peggy , you 're so unformed you 're practically fetal . You 're just taking pity on him 'cause he has no friends .
PEGGY: Dolores , ca n't you be a little kinder to people ? You do n't even know the boy . If you were n't so neurotic and insecure , maybe you 'd shut up for a while and show some compassion .
DOLORES: Are you for real ?
PEGGY: Touchy , touchy ! Dolores storms away .
MADDY: I do n't know what you said to her , ut I wish I 'd said it .
PEGGY: Charlie , what do you think of Richard Norvik ?
CHARLIE: Is he gon na help you with that physics stuff ?
PEGGY: He 's trying .
CHARLIE: Hey ! Who needs physics when we 've got chemistry ?
PEGGY: Come on , let 's dance .
WALTER: Put on some make—out music , and kill the lights .
CHARLIE: There is n't a girl in school that can hold a candle to you..
PEGGY: You 're pretty charming when you want to be .
CHARLIE: Yeah I know . But I do n't have to flatter you . It just feels right . You 're the perfect girl for me . As in is , was and always will be . I 'm glad dancing was invented . You know the first dances were rituals . Like fertility rites .
DOLORES: Hey Terry , what is that ? Did Peggy make it up ? I 've never seen that on Bandstand .
TERRY: What if we 're witnessing the end of touch dancing ?
PEGGY: Mmm . This is nice . I always loved the way you kiss . I missed you .
CHARLIE: Your eyes look like silver pools of moonlight . And the tide rushes in .
PEGGY: You really love me , do n't you ?
CHARLIE: You know I do . I even wrote you into my will .
PEGGY: Charlie , let 's make love .
CHARLIE: What ? ! You mean sex ? ! Intercourse ? You want to have intercourse ! Last weekend you said What time is it ?
PEGGY: A lot 's happened since last weekend .
CHARLIE: But you 're the one who wanted to wait till we got married . And you were right . We should wait .
PEGGY: I probably meant it when I said it . Does n't Lucky Chuckie want to come out ?
CHARLIE: Who ?
PEGGY: You know . Your love machine the throbbing thrill hammer you thing !
CHARLIE: You mean my wang ? Listen , it 's unning real late . Charlie pushes her away , angry..
PEGGY: This is a mistake . We bette forget it .
CHARLIE: You 're damn right ! Jesus ! Peggy ! You sure know how to spoil a mood .
PEGGY: I 'm sorry Charlie .
CHARLIE: Save it .
MONICA: What would you like ?
PEGGY: Monica ? Are n't you Monica Hines ?
MONICA: Yes . Who are you ?
PEGGY: Ah never mind . Can I have a coffee , please ? And a cinnamon cruller . How 's Bobo ?
MONICA: Twenty cents , please .
PEGGY: You 're kidding ?
MICHAEL: Gilfond 's okay , except he thinks Hemingway 's great Literature .
PEGGY: You do n't ?
MICHAEL: He 's a fisherman ! The most overrated writer of the century . I mean , he 's the perfect American author — fat , violent , drunk
PEGGY: Maybe you 're confusing his life with his work .
MICHAEL: A writer 's life is his work . Jack Kerouac does n't have to kill a bull to have something to write about . He 's out there feeling , burning grooving on life !
PEGGY: The young man leaned back in his chair . No bulls would die today .
MICHAEL: What 're you doing here anyway ?
PEGGY: Coffee and a donut .
MICHAEL: I thought chicks like you traveled in packs .
PEGGY: Hey , man , I 'm a hip chick .
DOLORES: Terry , slow down .
TERRY: Okay .
DOLORES: Terry ! Slow down .
TERRY: What , why ?
DOLORES: There 's Peggy with Michael Fitzsimmons .
TERRY: That commie beatnik ? What 's she doing with him ? Wait 'll I tell Charlie .
DOLORES: First a nerd and then a weirdo . What a bunch of nose pickers . I 'll tell Charlie .
MICHAEL: This is great reefer .
PEGGY: Yeah . I 'm surprised . It 's really old Travels well though . You know , the world looks a lot etter from up here .
MICHAEL: The world is fantastic . It 's the ultimate absurd circus . I am shot from a cannon into the energy .
PEGGY: What are you shooting for ?
MICHAEL: Maximum intensity . Yeah . I ca n't wait to get out of here . I 'm gon na write . I 'm gon na check out of this ourgeois motel . Push myself away from the dinner table and say 'No more Jell—O for me , Mom . '
PEGGY: Do n't you get along with you parents ?
MICHAEL: The only thing my father digs is cold , green money . All my mothe cares about is her standing at the country club .
PEGGY: They care about you . They 're just a different generation .
MICHAEL: Hey what 's with you ? I thought you were cool . You rode my bike . You lew some pot . What 's your scene Miss Majorette ? You gon na marry Mr. Blue Impala and graze around with all the othe sheep for the rest of your life ?
PEGGY: I already did that . I want to be a dancer , I want to dance .
MICHAEL: You know , I had you pegged all wrong .
PEGGY: Is that one of your poems ?
MICHAEL: No , I just made that up . Do you want to hear one ?
PEGGY: I 'd love to .
MICHAEL: Okay . Here 's a new one . It 's called Tenderness . I could n't sleep so I thought I 'd scream Betrayed by a kiss , sucking pods of itterness . In the madhouse of Dr . Dread Razor shreds of rat puke fall On my bare arms I 'm sorry . I guess I was trying to impress you .
PEGGY: Michael you 're as good as you looked . His other hand reaches to undo her skirt .
MICHAEL: I 'll respect you for eternity . 'When you are old and gray , and full of sleep , And nodding by the fire , Take down this book , and slowly read , And dream of the soft look your eyes had once . '' I did n't write that . That 's Yeats .
PEGGY: I envy you . You have your whole life ahead of you and you know exactly what you want to do . But forget the rat puke ; write something beautiful .
MILKMAN: Your parents are waiting up . You know , I see a lot of this in the spring . Good luck .
PEGGY: Thanks , Ralph .
MRS. KELCHER: Where have you been ?
PEGGY: I went for a drive . Up in the hills .
MR. KELCHER: Damn that Charlie I
PEGGY: It 's not Charlie . It 's me .
MR. KELCHER: Peggy , let me ask you something . You 're not expecting are you ?
PEGGY: At my age ? Do n't be silly .
MR. KELCHER: Thank God for that .
PEGGY: Dad.. it 's not a big deal . Did n't you ever stay out all night when you were young ?
MR. KELCHER: Yes but I was a boy . And I still had hell to pay .
PEGGY: Calm down . Just listen for a minute.. Please .
MR. KELCHER: All right . But this better be good .
PEGGY: I want to help with the family finances . I want you to buy some stocks . And gold . By 1980 gold is going to be worth eight hundred dollars an ounce . Then you sell .
MR. KELCHER: Do you know how ridiculous you sound ? First of all , it 's illegal for U.S. citizens to buy gold . And in the second place , the price of gold is regulated by the government .
PEGGY: I think they 're going to deregulate it .
MR. KELCHER: That 's your problems The more women think , the more trouble they get into .
PEGGY: Oh boy , that 's another thing that 's going to change . Who 's going to think for us ? Our husbands ? You know , you treat Mom like a maid . It 's not entirely your fault . Those were the attitudes in the fifties , and that 's the way you raised me . But give Nancy a break , encourage her to go to art school .
MR. KELCHER: I 've heard just about enough of this lunacy ! Go to your room !
PEGGY: Listen Dad , please . Buy IBM , buy Polaroid , buy Apple Computer . No , no . Not yet . Buy Xerox !
MR. KELCHER: Evelyn , take her to her room !
MRS. KELCHER: I 'm not the maid !
PEGGY: Way to go , Mom !
RICHARD: The way I see it , you have an unparalleled opportunity to become the richest woman in the world .
PEGGY: I 'm just not the type . Besides , I want to get out of here .
RICHARD: But you have a vision . Do n't you want to help your parents ?
PEGGY: I tried to tell them , but they would n't listen to me .
RICHARD: I 'm talking about invention , no investment . I know what people think of me . Mr. Spasmatician . Dick the Square Root . I 'll show them . You said I was going to be a millionaire . And you 're gon na help !
PEGGY: Richard , take it easy .
RICHARD: No offense , but for a person who says she 's lived an extra lifetime , you certainly are thick . Money is power.. Money makes people respect you
PEGGY: How come you never ask me any important questions ? Do n't you wonder if there 's going to be a nuclear war ? Or a cure for cancer ? What about your family ? What about people ?
RICHARD: I 'm curious , but I do n't want to know . Jeez , I hope you have n't been telling people what 's going to happen to them .
PEGGY: Give me some credit , will you ?
RICHARD: Good . You 're discreet . I like that in a partner .
PEGGY: Wbat 're you talking about ?
RICHARD: Look it 's very simple . You tell me everything that has n't been invented yet , and I 'll invent it . We 'll be partners . Fifty—fifty .
PEGGY: Sixty—forty .
RI CHARD: That 's not fair .
PEGGY: Okay , find yourself another vision .
RICHARD: You 're taking advantage of a minor .
PEGGY: When do we start ? A WAITRESS approaches their table .
WAITRESS: Do you know what you want ?
RICHARD: A Ton on a Bun , with fries .
WAITRESS: And you ?
PEGGY: Quiche Lorraine , spinach salad and a Perrier .
RICHARD: Come on . You ca n't be serious .
PEGGY: There are major fortunes to be made here . Leisure time and life—styles .

PEGGY: Not for you . Okay , there 's lots more .
RICHARD: Let 's see icrowavemays , ocketpay alculatorcays The two ladies react .
PEGGY: You do n't have to use pig Latin ! Nobody could possibly know what we 're talking about .
RICHARD: All right . These are the choices microwave ovens , pocket calculators , Walkmans , digital watches and miniature TV 's .
PEGGY: Oh . And huge portable radios . Everything else gets small , but fo some reason , portable radios get enormous .
RICHARD: What are you talking about ?
PEGGY: The wave of the future ! I 've decided on our first fortune ! I 'll see you later . You just think high tech .
RICHARD: High tech . I like the sound of that .
MR. BODELL: Look at that freezer chest . What capacity . Hello Peggy Sue .

PEGGY: Nice to see you .
MR. BODELL: Charlie 's in the back .
GENTLEMAN: I 'll just take the Ravel .
CHARLIE: Take the Shostakovich home and listen to it . Let it grow on you . Everyone that 's bought it has come ack and said , `` This is definitive Shostakovich . Thank you fo encouraging me to investigate it . ''
GENTLEMAN: Well , I did enjoy the Dvorak you suggested . Young man , you talked me into it . Charlie points Peggy to the listening booth .
CHARLIE: You 'll like it . I kid you not .
PEGGY: What do you know about classical music ?
CHARLIE: Nothing.. Selling is selling .
PEGGY: Charlie . About last nights..
CHARLIE: Forget it . I 've been thinking . Girls must go through that stuff too . Sometimes when I look at you I feel like an animal . Maybe my dad 's ight . Teenagers are nuts .
PEGGY: But I 'm not . I 'm a grown woman with a lifetime of emotional experiences you could n't possibly understand .
CHARLIE: Yeah , I know . Girls mature faste than guys . But last night , I was the one who put on the brakes . And you know why ?
PEGGY: Why ?
CHARLIE: Because nothing else matters . That 's the great thing about love . Every time we argue , every time something goes wrong , and I know that I 'm not perfect either , things just work out better in the end . Cause you 're my baby and I love you .
PEGGY: What am I going to do with you ?
CHARLIE: Do n't be cruel to a heart that 's true .
PEGGY: Hi , Dad .
MR. KELCHER: Doing some shopping ?
PEGGY: Open it .
MR. KELCHER: Sweetheart , they 're beautiful . But they must 've been expensive .
PEGGY: I closed my Christmas club .
MR. KELCHER: Good , you got your money out of that greedy bank .
PEGGY: I wanted to apologize for this morning .
MR. KELCHER: It 's hard to believe you 're going to be eighteen . Want an eskimo pie ? Or a creamsicle ? I 'd come home from the store and there 's little you running up to me . I 'd give you a dime and you 'd promise never to grow up .
PEGGY: Quiet today ?
MR. KELCHER: This morning was good .
PEGGY: The hat business is in trouble .
MR. KELCHER: I , that what all that nonsense was about this morning ? You 're worried about my business ?
PEGGY: Yes .
MR. KELCHER: That 's very thoughtful , honey . It 's just a slump . Things will pick up .
PEGGY: But when John F. Kennedy 's elected President , men'1l stop wearing hats .
MR. KELCHER: Kennedy 's a Catholic . He 'll neve win .
PEGGY: He 'll win .
MR. KELCHER: Richard Nixon 's going to be President . Nixon wears hats .
NANCY: You think this 'll cheer Dad up ?
PEGGY: Of course , he 'll love it . You 're a terrific artist .
MRS. KELCHER: Please do n't shout .
MR. KELCHER: I want everybody to hear because I do n't have anything to be ashamed of .
MRS. KELCHER: Jack , I was just trying to help .
MR. KELCHER: We 'll make it , we 'll be fine .
NANCY: Does this mean we 're going to be poor ?
CAROL: All right . What 's the scoop ?
PEGGY: On what ?
MADDY: How come we 're your best friends and we had to find out about you and Michael Fitzsimmons from Dolores ?
PEGGY: She 's unbelievable . Who needs satellites when we 've got Dolores 's mouth ?
CAROL: I hear she does more than talk with her mouth .
MADDY: That 's disgusting !
CAROL: ) Oh , Maddy , grow up . It says in LOVE WITHOUT FEAR that `` the tongue kiss as a means of genital stimulation is widely practiced and has much to commend it '' . Page eighty—six .
PEGGY: Did you memorize the whole book o only the good parts ?
CAROL: Just what you underlined .
PEGGY: You 're kidding ? Carol , you have eautiful hair .
CAROL: Come on . What 's with you and Michael ?
MADDY: Yeah . He 's so cool and mysterious .
PEGGY: He 's very interesting . For all his pretending to be a tough guy , he 's eally got the soul of a poet .
CAROL: I bet Dolores told Charlie .
PEGGY: That loud—mouthed little bitch~
MADDY: Peggy Sue !
CAROL: You better watch out for her . She 's after Charlie .
PEGGY: Cool it kids . He 's free to see other girls , if he wants .
MADDY: But I always thought that you would marry Charlie , Carol would marry Walter , and I would marry Arthur . We 'd all live on the same street and take our kids to the park together and have barbecues every Sunday . It 'll spoil everything if you and Charlie break up . That Michael does n't look like the arbecue type .
PEGGY: I 'm not going to marry him . I just went out with him once . I know ! Why do n't we go to the movies tonight . Just us girls . It 'll be fun .
CAROL: Do n't be silly . It 's Saturday . Date night !
MADDY: Yeah . I 've got ta go . Arthur 's picking me up soon .
PEGGY: Okay . But let 's have a girls night soon . Maybe a pajama party .
CAROL: Are n't we a little old for that ?
MADDY: Sometimes you 're so immature .
PEGGY: Ta da ! Pantyhose ! The death of the garter belt ! Of course , once they 're manufactured they 'll look etter than this . What do you think ?
MR. KELCHER: This is your great invention ? Would you wear those things ?
MRS. KELCHER: Would they go over my girdle o under ?
PEGGY: Instead of a girdle . And light as a feather .
MR. KELCHER: That 's all well and good , but we do n't have the money to manufacture them .
PEGGY: You need a partner . There 's a friend of mine at school whose father makes seat covers for cars , Mr. Fitzsimmons . I 've invited him and his family over for dinne tomorrow night .
MRS. KELCHER: Is n't that awfully forward ?
PEGGY: We 've got to move fast . This is an idea whose time has come .
MR. KELCHER: You mean to tell me that you invited this Mr. Fitzsimmons ove to talk about investing his money in your cockamamie idea ?
PEGGY: Wrong , Dad . Your idea .
CHARLIE: I have to talk to you..
PEGGY: What are you doing here ?
CHARLIE: Let 's go down to the basement .
PEGGY: I bumped into him after you dropped me off Last night . I did n't feel like going home , so we went for a ide .
CHARLIE: Then it 's true , dammit ! I had a miserable time tonight 'cause of you . When the Monotones did `` Book of Love —— Chapter Four you break up , wo n't you give it just one more chance '' I 'm thinking Did we eak up ? 'Cause if we did , I do n't even know about it ! . I thought we cleared all that up yesterday . Did that Maynard G. Beatnik give you what you wanted ?
PEGGY: You know I never could stand you sarcasm .
CHARLIE: You 're going to blow it , Peggy Sue . Nobody treats Charlie Bodell like this .
PEGGY: And why do you always refer to yourself in the third person , like Napoleon ? How come it always turns into an argument with you ?
CHARLIE: Look , I 've got the hair , got the eyes , got the teeth , I got the car . I 'm the lead singer , I 'm the man .
PEGGY: Charlie , . I 've been trying to postpone this . But what 's the point ? It 's over . I do n't want to hurt you . This is very hard for me . I 'm doing this for both of us . I really want you to be happy .
CHARLIE: I will be happy if I have you . I love you .
PEGGY: That wo n't make any difference . We just ca n't live together . And you had the nerve to drive up with that bimbo Janet .
CHARLIE: What are you talking about ? Who 's Janet ?
PEGGY: I just ca n't trust you anymore .
CHARLIE: What about everything I said to you this afternoon
PEGGY: That 's just it . You can always get to me . There 's this window in my heart and every time I leave it open , you climb in . Unless I close it now , nothing 's ever going to be different !
CHARLIE: But what has to be different ?
PEGGY: Everything . I have a good head fo usiness , I should be franchising the bakery . And I want you to give me your word that whatever happens , you 'll go to college . And finish .
CHARLIE: What ! What about the group and my singing career ? What about me ?
PEGGY: I 'm trying to save you years of frustration waiting for a big eak no . Waiting for that big disappointment so you could blame it all on me .
CHARLIE: You do n't know zip ! You think I 'm going to end up selling appliances like my father ? Chasing women around the store . I 've got to give it a shot . Why are you trying to kill the two things that mean the most to me ? Until yesterday you loved me and you loved us . ) What the hell has changed ? For two years I 've done nothing but love you . I 'll show you , I 'm going to be just like Fabian !
PEGGY: Hello , Grandma . It 's Peggy Sue . Much better . How are you ? I 'm very sorry about the other day .
RICHARD: What are you doing ?
PEGGY: Jogging . I was running , now I 'm jogging .
RICHARD: That 's what you were talking about yesterday ? Everybody does that in the future ?
PEGGY: Yep . It 's going to be a law . I broke up with Charlie last night .
RICHARD: That 's terrific . You did it . You eally changed the course of you destiny .
PEGGY: It was an unfair fight . He did n't have a chance . I 'm taking a real gamble . I loved him for a long , long time .
RICHARD: Cheer up . Now you can give some other guy a shot . Make it up to him later and buy him a yacht .
PEGGY: For God 's sake , forget the money ! I 'm going crazy ! I 'm a walking anachronism . I 'm a puddle of deja I 'm worried about my kids , Scott must be scared to death , I think my daughter 's doing drugs again . I ca n't have any fun here , I do n't have that innocence any more . I ca n't keep all this in anymore . I feel Like I 'm going to explode .
RICHARD: Look , the best scientific mind in this country is working on you case . May I make a suggestion ?
PEGGY: Like what ?
RICHARD: Suggestion ! Hypnotic suggestion ! Why did n't I think o~ that before ?
PEGGY: What do you know about hypnosis ?
RICHARD: Everything . This is perfect . The subconscious mind remembers all . You can give me more information on microchips and then pinpoint what happened at the reunion . Maybe that 'll give us a clue on how to get you back .
PEGGY: Look , I 'm desperate . I 'll try anything . But what if you ca n't snap me out of it ?
RICHARD: No offense , but you 're pretty out of it now .
PEGGY: Peggy Sue Kelcher . Or , Peggy Bodell . I 'm not sure .
RICHARD: Oh boy . Peggy , what are microchips ?
PEGGY: Ah.. they 're very tiny they look like a fingernail made out of an erector set
RICHARD: What will they be made of ?
PEGGY: I think it 's called silicon . Charlie told me that .
RICHARD: Silicon is from sand .
PEGGY: We were lying in the sand . It was my eighteenth birthday We were so awkward I would have married him anyway
RICHARD: In the future , will you have to marry a girl before you have sex with her ?
PEGGY: No . The Pill will change all that . Then he would n't have blamed me . We were just too young .
RICHARD: You mean you 'll give a girl a pill and she 'll want to have sex ?
PEGGY: No . The Pill will be for birth control . But girls do like sex . Maybe not the first time .
RICHARD: Will you take of f your blouse ?
PEGGY: Yes , every day . Maybe I should n't have worn that dress ? I told Beth it was a bad idea . That 's why they made me Queen . Peggy 's meandering makes Richard nervous .
RICHARD: No ! Yes ! I 'll be right out , Dad . Oh shit ! Peggy , I 'm going to snap you out of it .
PEGGY: I could n't help it —— I loved him .
RICHARD: One two three . You are now awake .
PEGGY: Richard ! You should be ashamed of yourself .
RICHARD: Me ? You went crazy ! You started taking your clothes off . I was putting them back on for you .
PEGGY: That 's just perfect is n't it ? Did it work ? Did you find out why I came back ?
RICHARD: I think it has something to do with your birthday . You were rambling . I did n't understand the rest .
PEGGY: God dammit ! How 'm I gon na got out of here ?
RICHARD: Hey ! Do you have any idea how much those beakers cost ? I usually charge for hypnosis .
PEGGY: Oh , go feel up your hamsters ! I hear rodents put out . Peggy storms out .
MRS. KELCHER: You know , dear , I think the pantyhose is a wonderful idea , but the next time you come up with something , please do n't stay out all night . Just tell us . We 'll elieve you .
PEGGY: Mom , how about a machine that 's like your blender , only it slices vegetables , kneads dough , chops meat and even make fresh pasta ?
MRS KELCHER: What 's pasta ?
MRS. KELCHER: These roses are beautiful . And so omantic ' . Who is this Michael ? Is he a friend of Charlie 's ? She moves the Jell-O mold .
PEGGY: No , just a friend of mine . I do n't think he Likes Jell—O .
MRS. KELCHER: What does Charlie think about that ?
PEGGY: You know Mom , it 's okay to have male friends . Besides , it 's ove with me and Charlie .
MRS. KELCHER: What ? When did it happen ? Your dad and I always expected you two to get married .
PEGGY: Yeah , I know Peggy Sue gets married . Case closed . Period . Mom , if you could live your life ove again , would you do the same thing ? Get married and settle down afte high school ?
MRS. KELCHER: All the college girls I knew were so well , dressed . I was worried that I would n't fit in . I did n't have the right clothes . I was so silly . But , I do n't have many egrets , and besides , r do n't have time to worry about the past . But Charlie . I hope you know what you 're doing .
MR. FITZSIMMONS: Moose ? I never thought I 'd have moose for desert . The adults laugh . Michael looks bored .
MR. KELCHER: Peggy Sue cooked the whole dinner .
NANCY: But Mom helped .
MR. FITZSIMMONS: You know , you should open a estaurant .
PEGGY: It 's incredibly difficult to make money in the restaurant business . You have to get up at five in the morning to go to the market , you have problems with spoilage , employee pilferage , and just try and collect from the credit card companies . They take months to pay . The whole table is astonished .
MR. FITZSIMMONS: How does a young gal like you know so much about business ?
PEGGY: Oh , I just picked it up from my dad . He 's a wonderful businessman .
MR. FITZSIMMONS: Really ?
MR. KELCHER: Ah , Ed , why do n't you and I adjourn to the den for a while ?
MICHAEL: That was quite an evening . Bourgeois , phony , decadent , stupid .
PEGGY: I should n't have put you through that . It must have been agony . Let 's do something .
MICHAEL: Five more weeks of school . And ten minutes past graduation I 'm gone . To freedom .
PEGGY: For everyone .
MICHAEL: Now listen , this is the plan . As soon as school is finished we go to Utah and
PEGGY: Utah ? I thought you 'd be going to New York or Paris . What 's in Utah ?
MICHAEL: Rita . I met her last summer . She 's cool . You 'll really dig her . She 's got this great little cabin in the hills , just outside of Provo where she raises chickens . I 'll write and the two of you can take care of the chickens to support us .
PEGGY: I ca n't do that .
MICHAEL: Why not ? Polygamy 's legal in Utah .
PEGGY: I hate chickens .
SINGER: Thank you . Now we 're happy to introduce , a friend of ours . He 's one damn fine singer , Mr. Charlie Dell ! We HEAR the GROVE BEGIN the SONG SEA OF LOVE .
MICHAEL: But what about the other night ? We were like two stars in the same constellation .
PEGGY: Michael , you and I are light years apart . You should go , but not with me .
MICHAEL: But we had heat baby . Passion ! Fire ! We owe it to ourselves to fuse together . At least one more time .
PEGGY: That 's a terrific line . You 're going to be a wonderful writer .
MICHAEL: You think so ?
PEGGY: Yes . We had a glorious night together . One day you 'll remembe and write about it .
MICHAEL: I can dig that . Bittersweet perfection . Dogs of lust on leashes of memory yeah .
PEGGY: Ssh . He 's great .
MICHAEL: Peggy Sue 's still stuck on treble without a cause .
PEGGY: I thought I knew everything about him .
MICHAEL: Can we split now ?
PEGGY: What ?
MICHAEL: My father . He 's not just the ultimate square . He 's a total crook .
PEGGY: How did it go with the pantyhose ?
MR. KELCHER: It 's the darndest thing . Ed knew what they were immediately . As a matter of fact , he said he 's got a product like that in development ight now .
PEGGY: Oh no !
MR. KELCHER: Did n't call , them pantyhose , though . What was it , Evelyn ?
MRS. KELCHER: Sheerotards . Catchy name , is n't it ? Like leotards .
PEGGY: He 's a liar ! He has no such thing ! It 's my own fault . I should have had it patented first . He 's a crook , damnit .
MR. KELCHER: Peggy Sue , watch your mouth .
MRS. KELCHER: Mr. Fitzsimmons is a very prominent man .
PEGGY: Oh , you 're both so naive .
MR. KELCHER: Look young lady , I grew up through the depression . I fought in the second World War . Six days a week I get up and deal with the public , the bank and the bill collectors . And on the seventh day , when God ests , I do n't have to listen to my daughter calling me a fool !
MRS. KELCHER: You have a point , dear .
CHARLIE: What 're you doing here ?
PEGGY: I wanted to talk to you , and I have one last thing to take care of at school . Then I 'm going to Good dog , Rusty . Good dog .
CHARLIE: Rusty 's dead . That 's Ajax
PEGGY: Oh . I guess I always liked Rusty etter . Could you give me a ride to school ?
CHARLIE: Sorry , the Blue Thunder 's out of commission for a while .
PEGGY: Well , how about a walk , Charlie Bell..
CHARLIE: How 'd you know about that ?
PEGGY: I was at Lena 's last night . You were terrific .
CHARLIE: Not terrific enough . What were you doing in that part of town ? Who were you with ?
PEGGY: What were You doing there ? You never told me you were singing with an R and B group .
CHARLIE: Hey . I guess there 's a lot of things we do n't know about each other . Charlie and Peggy walking .
PEGGY: I 'd forgotten how much music meant to you .
CHARLIE: That 's real big of you .
PEGGY: Stop being defensive . I want to help you . I wrote a song for you .
CHARLIE: You 're kidding . You wrote a song ? Is it about a guilty girl and a trusting guy she wants to hurt him , and he wonders why ? Peggy takes a piece of paper from her purse .
PEGGY: Not exactly , but with your great voice , it 'll be a huge hit . Honest .
CHARLIE: Fat chance . You know , Lee Wilkins came to hear me last night . He told me to forget it . You told me to forget it . My parents tell me to forget it .
PEGGY: Just take a look at it .
CHARLIE: If you took the trouble to write it , then sure , I 'll take a look at it . But I 'm beginning to think that maybe there 's more to life than music . I wonder if people would still like me if I stopped being Mr . Excitement ?
PEGGY: It means I care about you and what happens to you .
CHARLIE: That 's all I wanted to hear . 'Cause I 'm never going to give up on us . It 's easy to fall apart in a crisis . It 's easy to be selfish and say goodbye and good luck . But this is more than love . This is a mental decision . Just wait till tomorrow , when you see your birthday present . Then you 'll understand .
CAROL: Peggy , I have to talk to you .
PEGGY: What 's the matter ?
CAROL: It 's that jerk Walter .
PEGGY: What happened ?
CAROL: After Charlie told Walter that he oke up with you because he wanted to play the field , Walter decided he should do the same thing .
PEGGY: Welcome to the singles ' scene .
CAROL: What a I going to do for the rest of my life ? I do n't have a oyfriend anymore .
PEGGY: Look , Carol , maybe Walter 's done you a big favor . You always said you wanted to get out of town . Go for it . And be happy , goddamnit , I 'm rooting for you .
WALTER: Hey Charlie , what do you think of this ?
CHARLIE: Walter , maybe you should be a dentist .
DOLORES: What 's the matter , princess ? Lost your prince ?
PEGGY: You know Dolores , there 's a lot of things I could say to you , but you 're not worth the effort .
DOLORES: Oh ! You did that on purpose ! I hate you . Go gargle with razor blades !
PEGGY: I beg your pardon ?
DOLORES: Take a long walk on a short pier .
PEGGY: Have a nice day .
ROSALIE: What 's up ?
PEGGY: I think you should give up diving . It 's dangerous .
ROSALIE: Do n't be silly , I 'm the best in the county .
PEGGY: I know you are , but you have to stop . I could n't tell you before , I did n't know if I should . But you have to stop before you hurt yourself .
ROSALIE: I spend three hours a day practicing . I have trainers , I know what I 'm doing .
PEGGY: But accidents can happen .
ROSALIE: Not to me they do n't . I 'm going to win the State , then the . Nationals , and then I 'm going to the Olympics .
PEGGY: Rosalie , please , listen to me ! You have to stop .
ROSALIE: You 're sick . You should go to the nurse . I 'm going to tell Miss Dennis .
RICHARD: What 's the matter ?
PEGGY: It 's all , gone wrong , nothing 's working out .
RICHARD: Not true . I think I 'm making real progress on the microchip .
PEGGY: You were meant to . You 're one of those fortunate people that good things happen to . I have to get out of here . She starts to walk away .
RICHARD: Peggy , I believe you . I believe everything you told me . It 's wonderful . You 're the exception that proves the rule . She kisses him on the forehead .
PEGGY: I love you too , Richard . Thanks fo trying . She continues down the hallway .
CHARLIE: Hey , Peggy . Wait a minute .
PEGGY: Forget it , it 'll never work .
CHARLIE: Okay . Listen , I cancelled the tickets for Fabian . I thought it would be better for your birthday to eat at a nice restaurant , Chez Tres .
BUS DRIVER: Everybody gettin ' off at Dumont . Here we are .

PEGGY: I remember that book ! Grandpa , Grandma , I want to tell you something .
ELIZABETH: If you believe it , darling , then I elieve . Being young can be just as confusing as being old . The things that happened to me fifty years ago are more on my mind than what happened yesterday .

PEGGY: You betrayed me , Charlie . You were never there for me or the children . And now you come and tell me , `` Peggy , you 're scared . '' Of course I 'm scared . If you knew what I knew you 'd be scared shitless .
CHARLIE: You 're crazy ! You 're really out of your mind !
PEGGY: I might be crazy , but I 'm not crazy enough to marry you twice . There 's a lot of things I ca n't change . I ca n't even think about them . I tried . But I could n't even help Rosalie . I do n't want to be bitter . I 'm a naturally optimistic person . But you took advantage of that .
CHARLIE: Oh , Peggy . My poor Peggy . It 's all my fault . I 'm so sorry . I wo n't other you anymore . I promise . Please stop crying . Please . Peggy starts to compose herself .

CHARLIE: I wanted to apologize . I ca n't live without you .
PEGGY: What about Janet ?
CHARLIE: That 's over . I got tired of translating everything . She thought the Big Hopper was a hamburger .
PEGGY: Who are all the flowers from ?
CHARLIE: Everyone . Maddie and Arthur , Carol and Walter . Richard Norvick . And here 's a book , by that guy from high school , Michael Fitzsimmons . He dedicated it to you .
PEGGY: It could n't be me . I hardly knew him .

GENETIC DOCTOR: See here . This is what you need to look for .
AUGUSTUS: This is your brother Silus . You will teach him .
AUGUSTUS: This is good .
SILUS: Augustus . We failed this girl . We asked her to help us catch him , and then we failed her .
AUGUSTUS: Yes . But her death served a greater good . Every trap needs ait .
SILUS: Perhaps this is beyond us . Perhaps we should inform the authorities . The human beings .
AUGUSTUS: For now the Brothers feel we should deal with this ourselves .
SILUS: If they find out we are covering up these deaths
AUGUSTUS: Which is why you must find him . Silus .
SILUS: Perhaps they have good reason .
AUGUSTUS: Silus . Simply concern yourself with finding Edgar . Find you Brother so that we can help him . Before he kills again . Cut to
JONES: Everyone 's ready Lilly .
LILLY: About time .
JONES: Do n't you move !
LILLY: Do n't you dare .
JONES: God help us . What an appalling sight .
SLUM LANDLORD: I do n't know nothing about it . I give 'em out . Make sure everyone gets 'em .
JONES: That 's a lie ! We know you 've been trading influenza vaccine in the workhouses ! Another man now approaches Lilly .
FRANK: Lil ' . I think you should see this .
JONES: You 're a fucking liar !
SLUM LANDLORD: No , no , I swear it , I gave 'em their boosters , both of 'em . I 'm a responsible landlord , I swear to god . There must 've been something wrong with them vaccines .
JONES: This is a civil health violation ! You 're going to the hell house fo this . You can forget lovely Doris here where you 're going .
SLUM LANDLORD: I do n't know what you 're on about . I 've done nothing , I swear to god , I 've done nothing .
LILLY: It is my pleasure to inform you that you are under arrest fo trafficking influenza vaccine .
SLUM LANDLORD: I want my lawyer .
LILLY: This is a violation of the 12/10 health act , whereby you have withheld borough sponsored vaccines from your tenants .
SLUM LANDLORD: I want a lawyer !
LILLY: Anything you say will be held against you as evidence and , by endangering the public good , you are not entitled to a lawyer . The Slum Landlord just stares at her .
SLUM LANDLORD: Fuck you then . Lilly smiles grimly .
LILLY: There 's only one other thing .
PROSTITUTE: Oi ! How about me ? He promised me some of that . I earned it . Cut to
FRANK: Come one !
JONES: Lil ' , you want some ?
LILLY: Smells terrible .
JONES: I 'm not letting that scum put me off my food . That 'd be like a moral victory .
LILLY: I 'll get out here .
FRANK: You sure ?
JONES: Yeah . Lilly 's kid . It died of the influenza , did n't it .
FRANK: She 's never said anything about a kid .
JONES: No . She never says anything .
KID: Hey ? ! Hey !
AUGUSTUS: 300 years ago , with these simple instruments , the alchemist Guiseppi De Angelo discovered what we today call genetic science .
CHILD: All the bad things . Like bad germs and flu .
AUGUSTUS: Yes . That 's right .
JONES: Someone should flatten this cesspool and start again .
STREET REPORTER: Marm ? The Tribune . Do you have any comments on the death ?
LILLY: No .
STREET REPORTER: They 're saying it was a Brother , is that true ?
LILLY: Arrest her .
FORENSIC GUY: With the traffic . What 's it matter .
DOMINIC: Lil ' .
LILLY: Hello Dominic .
DOMINIC: Have you seen it ?
LILLY: Any identification ?
JONES: Where do you get a cup of tea around here ? No one answers . Jones shrugs .
LILLY: Alright , we 'll close this down gents . None of you are to say a word , not even to your old mother .
POLICEMAN 1: Now he wont talk . Did n't see anything . Lilly looks at the boy . So young .
LILLY: What 's your name ?
KID: Albert .
LILLY: You live around here ?
KID: You did ?
LILLY: Or should I say , I crawled out of here . The kid smiles . Lilly focuses on him now .
KID: A man .
LILLY: What kind of man ?
KID: A Brother .
LILLY: You 're sure it was a Brother ?
KID: He had teeth and everything .
LILLY: Where did he go ?
KID: He went straight up there . Lilly stares at the wall .
LILLY: Alright , you go with these men , they 'll look after you . I promise . She rises .
JONES: Now they 'll all want feeding .
LILLY: I 've quarantined the neighborhood .
ANDERSON: What about the telephonic companies ?
LILLY: They 're cooperating , closing all phone lines in and out except directly to us . Anderson nods .
ANDERSON: Sit , sit . She does .
LILLY: It 's better than the alternative , sir .
ANDERSON: I need you to stay with this , Lilly . You know Jamestown bette than anyone , how to handle the people . Lilly acknowledges the compliment .
LILLY: That 's nice for them .
ANDERSON: You have a problem with it ?
LILLY: Not particularly .
ANDERSON: Good . I think they can help . And I do n't want someone working on this whose got something against the Church .
LILLY: How do you know I do n't ?
ANDERSON: Lilly , you 're the least prejudiced person I know . In fact , you 're the only one I know . That 's important . The church is powerful , but more than that , people 's faith in the Brotherhood is about all they 've got these days . And the government knows it . Even the Queen herself is involved . This is political . Cut to
JONES: Lil ' . He 's here .
STEPH: Do you know who he is ? That 's Brother Silus . They say one day he will lead the Brotherhood . He 's a great man .
JONES: I think I hear choir music . Steph flashes Jones a resentful look .
STEPH: Do you respect anything ?
JONES: Hey . My old mum goes to church four times a week and gives blood . She 's happy as a lark . Just do n't expect me to kiss him , that 's all I 'm telling you . Cut to
LILLY: Senior Brother Edgar How long have you known about this ?
SILUS: A matter of weeks . Lilly smiles .
LILLY: Yes . Withholding evidence . Covering up two murders . And no one 's worried . If me or one of the people in Jamestown did that they 'd be in the hell house with the key thrown away . It seems the church is able to do whatever it wants . Silus nods .
SILUS: You 're right to not like it . It is political .
LILLY: Would n't want anyone criticizing the church I suppose .
SILUS: It 's more than that Captain . This is about prejudice , or rather the nature of it . As a female surely you would understand .
LILLY: Really .
SILUS: How many other Captains in this orough are female ?
LILLY: None ?
SILUS: How are your actions judged , the same or differently from the men .
LILLY: Differently .
SILUS: Exactly . If a white man kills , then he is just a killer . If a lack man kills , then all black men are suspect . That is the nature of prejudice . Those who are different are grouped together . If only one Brother does a bad thing then all Brothers are suspect , ecause we are different . And then what would this world be like , if there was no hope ? Lilly nods , acknowledging the truth of it .
LILLY: Alright then . So what do you suggest ?
SILUS: First , there is something you should hear . Cut to
LILLY: Ok , ok , quiet down .
JONES: There 's no chance . Not a hope in hell .
FRANK: He 's right . We do n't even know where to begin .
LILLY: Quiet !
SILUS: Thank you Captain . Could we have the plate ?
DOMINIC: What 'd he do ?
SILUS: He was personally responsible fo developing the most recent influenza antivirals . It is ecause of him that most of you are alive today . His behavio appeared normal . Next . 3 photos come up . The victims .
JONES: Next he 'll be wanting an fucking medal .
SILUS: What I am saying to you is that Brother Edgar 's behavior is aberrant . We
DOMINIC: How do you know ?
EDGAR: Quiet .
JONES: Fuck !
LILLY: Jones , sit down .
JONES: Why are we listening to this ? !
LILLY: Quiet !
EDGAR: Good . Now you 're quiet . We can hear Edgar moving around .
FRANK: He sent this to you . Specifically .
SILUS: We share the same mother . There is a bond .
LILLY: There will be two teams . Frank , I want you and Abernathy up in the uildings around Bridge Square . Frank nods .
JONES: What ?
LILLY: You heard me . He 's to be taken alive .
SILUS: Yes .
LILLY: Anything ?
SILUS: No .
LILLY: It 's getting late .
SILUS: He will come .
LILLY: Ok. We 'll sit tight .
JONES: This is a dud .
LILLY: Frank ? Cut to
FRANK: Yeah Lil ' .
LILLY: Anything ?
FRANK: Not a thing .
LILLY: Check each floor again .
FRANK: You heard her . Once more for the empire .
EDGAR: Shoo . Cut to
FRANK: Lil ' ! Lil ' ! Cut to
LILLY: Frank .
FRANK: He 's on the sixth floor ! He 's on the sixth floor !
LILLY: Let 's go .
JONES: Lil ' .
EDGAR: You 're so strong .
JONES: Lilly !
DOMINIC: Lilly 's hurt . She 's hurt !
JONES: She 's dying ! She 's fucking dying ! At that moment SILUS appears at the door .
SILUS: Do you want me to save her ? Jones wavers .
DOMINIC: He 's getting away ! !
SILUS: Quiet .
JONES: Get out of my way .
SILUS: No .
JONES: He killed Lilly .
LILLY: Antibiotics . They say it 's like an animal bite . Silus nods . He slowly sits on the bed .
SILUS: We all caught Edgar .
LILLY: I do n't mean that . The blood , they say it saved my life . Is it true that people who go to church are given your blood ?
SILUS: Sometimes the rituals call for it . Some say they have visions from it . That it restores their health .
LILLY: So smooth .
SILUS: In some ways my body is like a human embryo . The cells regenerate quickly . It is why we live so long . Will someone come for you ? Your family ? She releases his hand .
LILLY: I do n't have one . Not any more .
SILUS: I see .
LILLY: Influenza . My husband was quick . But my daughter , Mary , her little ody fought it for a long time . So I just waited . Hoped . But then you ealize how cruel hope is . And you just want it to end . Not to stop her suffering , but to stop my own .
SILUS: I am sorry .
LILLY: Do we seem pathetic to you ?
SILUS: No . Fragile . Worn down by nature . But you fight back .
LILLY: Yes . We 're good at that .
SILUS: I think yours will be a good life to watch , Lilly . Goodbye .
JONES: Nicely done . You 're more human than I thought .
AUGUSTUS: Silus . You know Professor Liepsky .
SILUS: How is he ?
PROFESSOR LIEPSKY: See for yourself .
SILUS: Is the brace necessary ?
AUGUSTUS: He decapitated a guard as they ought him in . Even though he was sedated . He said he will drink us all dry .
SILUS: Insane then .
PROFESSOR LIEPSKY: Not quite . Silus now turns to the Professor .
SILUS: With what ?
AUGUSTUS: Go on , Brother Silus will soon be part of the inner circle of the Brotherhood . He should know this . Cut to
PROFESSOR LIEPSKY: If she was n't restrained she would try to kill you . Do n't worry , it 's only transmissible through thei lood . We designed it that way . Silus quietly turns to the Professor .
SILUS: Designed ?
PROFESSOR LIEPSKY: Genetically designed . Edgar was experimenting with the virus that created you . It was sanctioned by the government .
SILUS: Since when do they sanction such things ?
PROFESSOR LIEPSKY: Since not one Brother has been orn in 70 years . And never a female of your kind from which we could breed . And we need to breed more Brothers . You give the world hope . To the people you 're like gods walking the earth .
AUGUSTUS: This is what Edgar was doing Silus . Trying to genetically control the birth of Brothers .
PROFESSOR LIEPSKY: And Edgar was successful . Each of these women carried a Brother , fo a time . But , the virus changed . Most of them have died and these will die soon .
SILUS: The police officer . Lilly . Did he infect her with this ?
PROFESSOR LIEPSKY: No . She was lucky . But it is in Edgar 's blood . It always will be .
SILUS: Hello my Brother .
EDGAR: Do you like what they 've done fo me Silus ? He moves again , as if enjoying it .
SILUS: You are sick . We will help you if we can .
EDGAR: Help me ? I am being what I was meant to be . How can you help me from that ? Or do you want to tame me ? Brainwash me ? Animal o vegetable , are those the two choices , Silus ? Edgar leans closer to Silus .
SILUS: She survived .
EDGAR: Good . I will have her again .
SILUS: You wo n't touch her .
EDGAR: You 've chosen to watch over her . You want her do n't you ? I can see it in your eyes . You are like me . Silus ' control has returned now .
SILUS: I will pray for your cure , Brother . Silus then turns and leaves .
EDGAR: I wont be able to forgive you fo this you know ? Not ever . In fact , when I get out of here
LILLY: Take them away from here . Jones nods as Lilly walks off .
JONES: You do n't feel like a drink ?
CONSOLE OPERATOR: If you do n't stop that we 'll use the gas . You hear me ?
JONES: I knocked . Lilly turns to Jones .
LILLY: You nearly gave me a heart attack .
JONES: What 's this then ?
STEPH: My apartment was condemned , keep your hair on , what 's left of it .
TV PRESENTER: the ascension through the ranks of the Church has been fast fo Brother Silus . He will now be the highest ranking cardinal outside the ruling council of the Brotherhood . This is largely seen as a reward for his handling of the last influenza pandemic .
STEPH: Is n't he amazing ? Jones sneers under his breath .
JONES: A saint .
LILLY: Quiet .
TV PRESENTER: You have been an opponent of those who want an easing in the ban on genetic research .
SILUS: Yes .
TV PRESENTER: They would say you 're denying legitimate research into a science that would change the world .
SILUS: The church does not deny the potential . Only the motivations of those who want to exploit it . And the fact that we understand so little of its power .
TV PRESENTER: With the elimination of influenza , are we approaching a new era where disease might be a thing of the past ?
SILUS: Disease is part of nature , it will always be a part of our lives . Close on Edgar .
EDGAR: How true .
TV PRESENTER: Brother Silus ' confirmation ceremony will be held today in the sacred Chapel of St. Augustine where all the Brotherhood will gather . Edgar listens , smiles .
CONSOLE OPERATOR: I turned off the lights to try and calm him
AUGUSTUS: The blood flows , through them , to us and we preserve them , preserve the blood we are bound to protect .
SILUS: Let the blood be one and the two aces join , as the Perfect Creature . Cut to
EDGAR: Today my brother enters the history books , Professor .
PROFESSOR LIEPSKY: Move back !
EDGAR: Tonight all the Brothers will be with him . A perfect day for me to celebrate .
AUGUSTUS: Now he carries this thing out into the world . Can you imagine what will happen if he infects others ? Or if the experiments were known .
SILUS: The question becomes what will he do next ? He said he would kill us all . But especially the police officer . Lilly . Cut to
PROSTITUTE: Come on governor , you going to pay me or not ?
FREDDY: Soon enough my cherub . I 've not finished with you yet .
STEPH: Police ! Put the gun down now !
FREDDY: It 's ok . I 'm complying officer , see .
STEPH: Put the gun on the ground and step away !
FREDDY: I 'm doing it .
PROSTITUTE: He 's crazy ! Fucking crazy ! She gives Freddy the finger then heads off .
STEPH: Wait ! Down ! Right now , down on the ground ! Freddy gets down .
FREDDY: I 'm getting wet now .
STEPH: Shut up !
FREDDY: Sure . Anything you say .
EDGAR: Nice to meet you again .
FREDDY: What 's wrong ?
EDGAR: You brought me the wrong one .
FREDDY: Does it matter , one 's as good as the next ?
EDGAR: What do you see Freddy . Visions ? Can you see your future ?
FREDDY: Hey !
EDGAR: Do n't be a greedy little pig Freddy . You have to earn more .
LILLY: Police . Put your hands where I can see them !
PARISHONER: Holy brother , please Lilly grabs Silus ' shoulder .
LILLY: Let him go . She shows Silus the pamphlet .
PARISHONER: Forgive me . I 've offended you We see Silus ' dark stare . A beat .
SILUS: No . You are divine . It is the world that offends me .
LILLY: Brother Silus . What 's going on ?
JONES: A shopkeeper heard yelling . Went to see , found this . One witness . A prostitute .
SILUS: It is Edgar .
LILLY: And now he 's got Steph . Why does he want her ?
SILUS: She is not what he was after . We see Lilly slowly getting it .
LILLY: Steph was staying with me . She was wearing my coat . It was me he was after . Was n't it ?
SILUS: Yes . He will come for you Lilly .
JONES: Right , then we put you somewhere safe and set up this place . Shooters on the roofs . And when he comes we blow his fucking brains out .
SILUS: He will know . He will see and hea it .
LILLY: It has to be me . That 's what he wants . It 's the only chance Steph 's got .
JONES: What are you talking about , she 's probably dead already
LILLY: Jones ! And we ca n't make it too hard . He has to be able to get in . He ca n't suspect anything .
STEPH: Help me . Please , I 'm sick . Help me .
FREDDY: Do n't fucking touch me .
JONES: What are you doing ?
LILLY: What is it ? Jones ? Cut to
SILUS: Stay here . Silus immediately drops out of the window . Cut to
JONES: Get back here , Lilly !
LILLY: Cover me .
EDGAR: You saved me

EDGAR: The little policewoman .
LILLY: Do n't move !
EDGAR: Oh , I 've killed her already . Essentially .

EDGAR: We will see . You will be my tool .
JONES: You happy now ? Cut to
FREDDY: You scared the shit out of me . Hey , the police woman . She 's real sick . To tell the truth I do n't feel so hot myself . Edgar approaches , still silhouetted .
EDGAR: I want you to take her and put he where they 'll find her .
FREDDY: But I 'm sick . She 's given me something
EDGAR: What have I said to you ?
JONES: Stephanie Richards , you just ought her in .
NURSE: Thank god you 're here .
JONES: Will she recover ?
DOCTOR: No . Containment is the issue now . She is insane . And we 've had more cases , 10 in the last hour . The Doctor leaves . Jones turns to Silus .
JONES: What is this ? What is it ?
SILUS: It comes from Edgar . He has shared his blood with them .
JONES: You 're telling me that he 's out there spreading this around ? Jones gets close to Silus , intimidating .
DOMINIC: Jones ! Back off .
JONES: That 's it , Lilly 's dead .
SILUS: No . He will keep her alive .
DOMINIC: Why ?
SILUS: So that I will come for him . That 's what he wants .
DOMINIC: It says , `` Everything flows from me . My blood will change the world . '' What does that mean ?
EDGAR: It almost sounds like children playing , do n't you think ?
LILLY: No .
EDGAR: I looked at your body . You have orne a child . Lilly 's features tense .
LILLY: Why do n't you just kill me ?
EDGAR: I can see why he likes you . But I have a better use for you . To save you , Silus will take my blood . Join me .
LILLY: You 're insane .
EDGAR: The world is insane . I am bette than you . But they force me to serve you . Does that happen in a sane world ? Forced to watch you waste the most precious thing you have . Life .
LILLY: You do n't have to do this . You can change things .
EDGAR: You have reminded me of something .
REPORTER: Some say this plague is the result of genetic experimentation , by the Brothers . Do you have a comment ? Cut to
HEALTH OFFICIAL: We 're asking everyone to stay in their homes in the sections of Jamestown now under quarantine .

EDGAR: Do you like the world I am making for us , Silus ? I have n't had you little policewoman yet . But I will soon . You 'll just have to find me . You know where I am . Everything flows from me . Remember that
AUGUSTUS: The infection is spreading . Each day he shares his blood with more of them . Even though they are locked in their homes .
SILUS: He is somewhere in the quarantine zone . I will find him .
AUGUSTUS: Clear . So very clear your eyes . The way they were when you were orn . There will be no search .
SILUS: No search ?
AUGUSTUS: The Queen has instructed the government to evacuate the city around the quarantine zone . In another day they will take action .
SILUS: What kind of action ?
AUGUSTUS: Eradication . Of everything within the area . They will burn it all . Including Edgar .
SILUS: And the innocents there , who are not infected ?
AUGUSTUS: It is a necessary step . We can not let this escape .
SILUS: No !
AUGUSTUS: Is it the policewoman ? Is this affecting your thinking ? There is no love for our kind Silus . Only service .
SILUS: We have done this . Released this thing into the world . We have etrayed their trust in us , more than once . I wo n't do it again .
AUGUSTUS: There is no debate . They will be sacrificed , so the rest will be pure . Silus shakes his head .
JONES: Great .
SILUS: I want to help you . They know you talked to the press .
JONES: They can fuck off . For that matter , so can you . Jones takes a slurp on his drink .
SILUS: Why ?
JONES: I saw you . Remember . Watching Lilly , when she was asleep .
EDGAR: You know where I am . Everything flows from me
SILUS: Do you have a map ? Cut to
JONES: There 's the quarantine zone . It 's a pit . Slums .
SILUS: The water supply . Where is it ?
JONES: There , all the old suburbs are supplied by their own artesian wells . Mineral springs . That 's why it has n't broken out of Jamestown , it 's the water . Jamestown 's water .
SILUS: He is there , with Lilly . We see the Map .
JONES: You 'll never get in , they 've circled the whole borough . Silus turns to Jones .

ADLER: Press has been waiting almost an hour , Red .
RED: Yeah . Clear as a bell Mi ' sabe .
ADLER: What 'd he say ?
RED: Who ?
ADLER: The Guvner ' , Red . Red closes the file .
RED: Reminded me it 's an election year . Red turns his attention to Sally .
SALLY: Uh no .
SALLY: Last what ?
RED: Secretary .
ADLER: Penny Munroe .
SALLY: I believe you have me confused . I 'm here from Huntsville . Assigned by Governo Connally .
RED: Adler what is this ? Adler searches the messy desk for something .
ADLER: Rings a bell , Red . Believ ' they sent us something about her this mornin '
RED: Who sent ?
ADLER: Guvner ' , Red .
ADLER: Here it is .
SALLY: Uh , I 'm Sally Gerber . Criminologist with the State Prison System .
ADLER: Tom Adler . Deputy . State Police System .
SALLY: It 's a relatively new procedure but I was assigned by Governor Connally
RED: 'to work with State law enforcement officials in all affairs where penal matters coincide with those of the State Police . ' It do n't say nuthin ' about
SALLY: It includes parole and work release programs as well as penal escape situations .
ADLER: On our way , Marge . Adler hangs up the phone .
SALLY: The idea is that an understanding of the particular behavioral case histories should , in parole situations , help the subject to avoid habitual traps and , in penal escape situations could , conversely , identify those self-same traps as an aide to apprehension .
RED: In the first place , Miss Gerber .
SALLY: Sally , please .
RED: In the first place , Sally , it ai n't a 'penal escape situation . ' It 's a manhunt . Fancy words in a circle do n't help much .
SALLY: And what does ?
RED: A nose like a Blue Tick , a medulla with an antenna and one helluva lot of coffee . And with that he 's out the door .
REPORTER #1: Is the prison employee with them ?
RED: Was when they left the prison .
REPORTER #2: What 's the rap sheet on these guys like ?
RED: Long as Christmas eve to a kid . Haynes was doin ' 40 for armed robbery and Pugh was idin ' 20 hisself for manslaughter and assorted parole vios .
REPORTER #3: Is there any indication of
RED: Lem me ' finish , Billy . This mornin ' another hostage was taken from a private home in Madisonville . A boy , age 8 . Grabbed him out of bed .
REPORTER #1: Any sex offenses on Haynes or Pugh ?
RED: Yer ' askin ' if they 're preverts . Well , one is .
REPORTER #4: You got inter-agency cooperation on this ?
RED: Texas Rangers as the criminal investigation arm of the D.P.S . share responsibility with the F.B.I . due to the kid being taken . But I doubt they 're out of bed yet . A few chuckles .
REPORTER #3: Red , how do you plan to apprehend the escapees ?
RED: Officially I can only say we have a full manhunt team on their trail and we 'll proceed with due haste .
REPORTER #3: And unofficially ?
RED: Unoffically ? I 'm gon na ' hunt 'em like the rabid dogs they are .
RED: That 's all I 've got but I 'd like to introduce ya ' to Miss Sally Gerber . She 's straight from the Governor 's office . Knows all about psychological profiles and the like . You probably have some questions for her .
SALLY: You have a question ?
REPORTER: Yes I do .
BUTCH: We got a handful of caps and yer ' shootin ' water tanks . He 's a smart guy , huh , Phillip ?
ADLER: All right , that 's it , boys . Chief 's got work to do .
SAUNDERS: So whattaya ' think ?
RED: So I hear .
SAUNDERS: Latest technology , oversized engine , complete kitchen and sleeping quarters , gun racks , frig , stove , the works . Even got a hot line phone straight to the Governor 's office .
RED: Fine piece of machinery .
SAUNDERS: What 's more , as soon as it gets back from Dallas it will be at your requisitioned disposal . Perfect for lots of situations a headquarters on wheels .
RED: We 'll take it .
SAUNDERS: Uh , Chief ? .
RED: Guvner ' hisself told me this manhunt was top priority .
ADLER: S'cuse me . This here 's Bobby Lee . He 's a specialist with the Feds . They want him to tag along .
SAUNDERS: Please , Red , ya ' got ta ' believe me
RED: Who are you ?
SUTTLE: Dick Suttle , the driver .
RED: Not anymore . Bradley .
SAUNDERS: This man stays with the vehicle whereve it goes , Red !
RED: You know how to operate the gadgets ?
SUTTLE: Yessir .
RED: Grab a seat .
SAUNDERS: Please Red , I 'm beggin ' . I mean , what am I suppose to tell the Governor ?
RED: Tell John that Miss Gerber here checked me out on it .
SAUNDERS: Not a scratch , you hear me , Suttle ? Not a scratch !
RED: You comin ' or not ?
SALLY: I 've got it .
JERRY: Why the hell we stoppin ' ?
BUTCH: You said you had a cousin near here .
JERRY: So ?
BUTCH: So give him a call . See if we can shack there til ' things cool down .
PHILLIP: Why 'd he take the keys ?
BUTCH: So I wo n't leave him .
PHILLIP: Would you leave him ?
BUTCH: Oh yeah .
JERRY: Musta ' moved . Prolly ' could n't have heard 'em anyway . Goddam ear 's still bleedin ' . You ever try that shit again
BUTCH: What ?
JERRY: What ?
BUTCH: You were in the middle of threatenin ' me .
JERRY: Ai n't a threat . It 's a fact .
BUTCH: Here kid , take the wheel .
BUTCH: And that 's a fact .
JERRY: I 'm gon na ' kill you for that .
BUTCH: And that 's a threat . Beginnin ' to understand the difference ?
JERRY: Get beer . Butch hands Phillip the revolver .
BUTCH: Here , hold it like this . And point it ight between his eyes .
JERRY: What the hell ?
BUTCH: If he so much as moves you pull the trigge right here Put your finger on it .
JERRY: Yer ' a fuckin ' crazy man .
BUTCH: And that 's a fact . I believe ye gettin ' the hang of this .
MAN: Hot in the first aisle . Cold in the ack , in the cooler .
JERRY: You ever shot a gun before , boy ?
PHILLIP: Be quiet , mister .
JERRY: Naw . You ai n't never shot no gun before . Livin ' in a house with three split tails no Daddy around . You 'll prolly ' grow up queer , you know that ? A bead of sweat rolls down Phillip 's cheek .
OLD MAN: This be all for ya ' ?
BUTCH: This and a carton of Chesterfields . Are those .38 shells ? Gim me a box .
OLD MAN: With deposit comes to four dollars eighty .
BUTCH: Used cars . Buy 'em , fix 'em up . Sold a Cadillac down in Madisonville this mornin ' .
OLD MAN: Do n't say .
JERRY: Come over a little closer .
JERRY: Whatcha ' gon na ' do ? Hit me with it ?
BUTCH: Thick as theives .
BUTCH: You got a phone ?
OLD MAN: Naw .
BUTCH: Then go inside and lie down til ' we 're gone .
ADLER: Got a spot on 'em . A store right outside of Benhur . About 20 miles from here .
RED: All right . Push the roadblock on 288 north by 50 miles .
ADLER: Ya ' figger ' they 're that far along ?
RED: Hell , I dunno'and neither do they . They 're jus ' happy to be out . It 's a high speed Sunday drive to them .
ADLER: Sunday drive . I like that . Never heard you use that one before , Red .
RED: Somethin ' eatin ' at you ?
SALLY: It 's perhaps premature , but do you have an auxiliary roadblock plan for when they split up ?
ADLER: What makes you so sure they wo n't stay together ? Sally hesitates . Red notices
RED: You got somethin ' to say , spit it out .
SALLY: Their situation is one of accommodation . They wo n't be together long . Silence . Sally continues .
ADLER: What about the hostages ? They gon na ' flip a coin to see who gets to keep who ?
SALLY: It 's happened before . Either way it 's a dilemma they 'll address soon . That 's why we should address it now .
RED: We do n't have a dilemma . And neither do they . They 'll keep one hostage and get id of one , if they have n't already .
SALLY: Okay which one ?
RED: If there 's a SNAFU , who 's John Q . Public more likely to give a rat 's ass about an innocent boy or a goddam bureaucrat .
SALLY: We need to talk , Chief Garnett .
RED: Call me Red .
SALLY: Red . Why are you so hell-bent on embarassing me ?
RED: I 'm hell-bent on one thing . You hang around long enough you 'll find that out . Til ' then a tough backside and a sense of humor will get you through a lot .
SALLY: I have a fine sense of humor , but the one thing I wo n't do is be your straight man so you can play hero to a bunch of morons who think you 're some kind of hillbilly Sherlock Holmes .
RED: Awful . Arthur Godfrey says it keeps ya ' young , but I 'm not sure it 's worth it .
SALLY: I 'd like an answer .
RED: This yer ' first time out of an office ? She refuses to answer .
SALLY: You think I 'm what ? Some dumb schoolgirl who wandered into the boy 's locker room ? Well you 're wrong . I do n't mean to boast , ut I happen to be one of the two most intelligent people involved in this fiasco .
RED: Did n't ask that . Asked what you expected .
SALLY: I expected to be allowed to do the jo assigned to me by the Governor .
RED: I happen to like the Governor , hunt quail together every year . But deep down he and I know that win , lose or draw this is my ship , not his .
SALLY: The Governor as chief executive office of this state bears ultimate responsibility for
RED: Bullshit . Responsibility lies with the one that loses sleep ; the one with the most ulcers . This mess turns bloody and it might all it 's gon na cost the Governo is a few votes ! Me , I 'm the one that 's
SALLY: You 're the one that what ? But Red side-steps .
RED: Tell ya ' what . You think I 'm makin ' a wrong turn you speak up . Might not agree , ut I 'll listen . As far as stepped on toes and wounded pride , I 'll buy everyone a drink when we head for home . Not until . I got more to worry about . That sound fair to you ?
SALLY: Yes .
RED: Well okay then . Sally turns , about to leave .
SALLY: Other one ?
RED: If yer ' one brain , who 's the other ?
SALLY: Haynes . He was tested in prison .
PHILLIP: Thankyew . Are you gon na ' shoot me ?
BUTCH: No . Me ' n you are friends .
BUTCH: If I was choosin ' a runnin ' buddy , I 'd take you over him any day of the week .
RED: We got a positive I.D . ?
LOCAL SHERIFF: Yessir , with only the boy as hostage . But not five minutes ago we found something else .
RED: Least now we know who 's in charge .
BUTCH: Whattaya ' thinkin ' about ?
PHILLIP: Nuthin ' .
BUTCH: If I guess you tell me ? Phillip nods .
BUTCH: I hear ya ' , Phillip , but look around . I ca n't very well leave you here , can I ?
PHILLIP: A car .
BUTCH: Yer ' lookin ' at this thing bassackwards . This is a 20th Century time machine . I 'm the captain and you 're the navigator . Butch points forward through the dash .
BUTCH: This is the present , Phillip . Enjoy it while it lasts .
SUTTLE: It 's an intercom speaker system . You can get and give instructions to and from the ear of the vehicle .
BRADLEY: How 's it work ?
SUTTLE: You push the power button but if you 've got the volume turned up
BRADLEY: This thing 's prolly ' got a warranty . You oughta ' make a list of all the things that are wrong .
ADLER: That oughta ' put his pecker in a sling , huh , Red ? Sorry , ma'am .
SALLY: Should n't these be roadblocked as well ? She points to several other unmarked roads .
RED: Sooner or later he 'll get on a main road . We do n't got the manpower to roadblock every farm to market .
ADLER: In a perfect world , Miss Gerber , we 'd lock arms and thrash the bush til ' he turned up
SALLY: In a perfect world things like this would n't happen in the first place .
ADLER: Locals are heading out . Wan na ' follow ?
RED: Let 's sit tight . He 'll turn up .
BUTCH: Ok , Phillip , we 're gon na do some ca shoppin ' . You ever play cowboys n ' Injuns ? See that Ford sedan ? Now I want you to sneak on over there like an Injun and take a peek and see if the keys is in it . Phillip hesitates .
PHILLIP: It 's got keys and a radio . I checked .
BUTCH: Good man . Phillip holds his crotch and stamps his feet .
PHILLIP: Can we stop at a fillin ' station .
BUTCH: What for ?
PHILLIP: Number one .
BUTCH: This here 's nature , Phillip . Pee in the ditch .
BUTCH: Start , you sonofabitch ! The Farmer runs faster , comes closer
FARMER: Hey , that 's my car ! Hey ! ! !
BUTCH: Get in the car , Phillip !
FARMER: Aaaaaayyyyyy ! ! ! !
BUTCH: Goddam , boy , how many RC 's did you drink anyway ?
PHILLIP: Four . Butch shakes his head and laughs .
BUTCH: One thing 's for sure . You got one helluva set of chompers .
BRADLEY: Lighter do n't work . Put that on the list .
ADLER: Highway 16 north . Four miles south of Desdemona . Got it . Stole a vehicle .
RED: What kinda ' shape 's it in ?
ADLER: What 's that ?
SALLY: The Ford he stole .
ADLER: Owner told the locals they only drove it to church , but it does have a bad emergency ake . How 'd ya ' know it was a Ford ?
SALLY: He likes Fords . Adler looks at the map .
ADLER: Looks like you was right , Red . He 's off the farm to market and onto a spur . Whattaya ' wan na ' do ?
RED: Beef up the I-20 roadblock . Adler gets more news through the headsets .
ADLER: What 's that ? Red , the locals wan na ' know if they 're to take a clean shot if they get one ?
RED: No .
ADLER: Uh no .
ADLER: No , er , yes . No means negative . Same thing . Over .
RED: I do n't want some half-ass Sergeant York taking pot shots with a deer rifle . Adler puts the headphones back on . Bobby Lee smirks a bit .
SALLY: It 's the only thing to do . He 's got the child with him .
BOBBY LEE: I suppose you figger ' he 'll jus ' give up .
SALLY: Maybe , maybe not .
BOBBY LEE: Well now there 's a safe bet .
SALLY: I 'll give you a safe bet . The boy 's in better hands now than he was .
RED: The third eye Pugh 's sportin ' on the way to the morgue shouts otherwise .
BOBBY LEE: Then why not shoot to kill .
ADLER: They 've forwarded the stolen vehicle license to the roadblocks . You still wan na ' go to the farm ?
RED: Yeah . I got ta ' hunch .
BUTCH: You got blue eyes don'tcha ' , Phillip ? Never met a blue-eyed Phillip before . Who you named after ?
PHILLIP: My daddy .
BUTCH: You and your old man get along all right ?
PHILLIP: Yeahsir .
BUTCH: Toss the ball around , play grab-ass in the yard , that sorta ' thing ?
PHILLIP: Nawsir .
BUTCH: Why the hell not ?
PHILLIP: He ai n't around , really .
BUTCH: Well he is or he ai n't . When 's the last time you saw him ? Phillip shrugs .
PHILLIP: My Mama says he 'll prolly ' come back . Prolly ' when I 'm ten or so .
BUTCH: Well she 's lyin ' to ya ' pure and simple . He ai n't never comin ' back . Disappointment registers on the boy 's face .
BOY: What can I do ya ' for ?
BUTCH: Tell him your name .
PHILLIP: Phillip .
BOY: Fill-er-up it is . The attendant starts to pump the gas .
BUTCH: See there ! All you got ta ' do is say you name and people are waiting on you hand and foot . Like a goddam king or somethin ' . Phillip ca n't help but smile at the notion .
BRADLEY: You responsible for engine maintenance on this thing ?
SUTTLE: Uh , yeah . I 'm the full time driver .
SUTTLE: What ? Why ?
BRADLEY: You notice how it keeps wanting to slip a it goin ' into second . Feels to me like somebody 's been a little heavy-footed with the clutch . I 'd take care of that if I was you .
ADLER: No bodies this time , thank Gawd .
RED: You got the keys to this thing ?
ADLER: Uh naw
RED: Get me a crowbar . You might wan na ' wait in the boat .
SALLY: No thank you .
RED: Well .
BUTCH: You ready to get out of those skivvies and into some britches ? Phillip nods .

LUCY: Well , hello there and welcome to Friendly 's .
BUTCH: As a matter of fact . Shoes and new skivvies , too . He 'll tell you his size . Go with the lady , Buzz .
LUCY: Buzz , what a cute name . Like a bee .
CHILDREN'S AISLE: Lucy is holding jeans up to Phillip 's waist .
LUCY: It 'd be easier if I knew your size , but we 'll get it right . Phillip 's eye catches something
PHILLIP: wearing the Casper mask .
PHILLIP: Boo .

PHILLIP: A bandit .
TERRANCE: Aw shit
BUTCH: Whattaya ' think ?
PAULA: Look good . He adds them to the pile of stuff .
BUTCH: You folks are about the grinninest bunch I ever seen .

LUCY: Here 's the clothes , but Buzz has his heart set on a Halloween costume fo next year . It is half off .
BUTCH: We 'll get it next time . Go get in the car , son .
TERRANCE: Okay , Pete , I 'm all set down here . You ?

PHILLIP: It 's puny .
BUTCH: What ?
PHILLIP: It 's puny .
BUTCH: Well hell , lem me ' see . Phillip still hesitates .
ADLER: Haynes bought tape , rope , and some clothes for the boy .
SALLY: Probably scared to death .
ADLER: That 's not all . The kid stole a Halloween outfit .
RED: Holy Jeezus , they 're a team .
ADLER: With the pit stop in Noodle looks like he 's headed for the Panhandle .
SALLY: What ?
ADLER: There 's more roads than people in the Panhandle .
SALLY: How 's that happen ?
KAISER: Poor counties . They tend to half finish oads then start on another one .
ADLER: But if anybody knows them backroads it 's Red .
SALLY: Okay , so I 'm Robert Haynes . Called Butch by everyone . I was born in Amarillo , but grew up in the French Quarter of New Orleans .
ADLER: What 's she doin ' , Red ?
SALLY: I killed a man when I was eight .
RED: How 'd ya ' kill him ?
SALLY: Shot him with a pistol . There was always one around the dance hall . That 's what they called it but it was a whorehouse . We lived there .
ADLER: What 'd the authorities do ?
SALLY: The victim was wanted by the locals so the whole thing got shoved under the carpet Cajun-style .
ADLER: They did n't even stick him in juvy ?
SALLY: Put me in school . Three years behind ut I catch up .
KAISER: Sounds like things are goin ' okay ' now ?
SALLY: They were . For awhile . When I 'm twelve mom dies .
ADLER: What happened ?
SALLY: Delilah Jane Haynes hung herself in the athroom of the brothel . Could have saved herself the trouble . Post-mortem check uncovered last stage syphilis .
KAISER: Where 's yer ' father ? Red 's face tells us he 's listening .
SALLY: Nobody knows where he is now . Ditched when I was six . He was a small-time felon . Popped up again after Mom died he 'd just een paroled . Moved us back to Amarillo . A year later I 'm in trouble again .
ADLER: Yeah ? Kill somebody else ?
SALLY: Took a joyride in a Ford coupe that I just could n't resist .
KAISER: Hell , that 's no big deal .
SALLY: Judge gave me four years in Gatesville , toughest juvy farm in Texas .
ADLER: That 's where the son-of-a-bitch learned to be a criminal . Seen that before , ai n't we , Red ?
BOBBY LEE: So , Butch , why do n't you tell us where yer ' goin ' , save us the trouble o ' huntin ' you down ?
SALLY: Where I 'm going is n't as important as 'Why am I going there ? '
BOBBY LEE: Shit . 'Caus ' I 'm runnin ' and they 're chasin ' and I 'd jus ' as soon go north as south as east as west . It 's a fun lil ' parlor game , lady , but right now Butch Haynes do n't have the slightest idea where he 's headed !
BUTCH: An inch is 24 miles . Hold yer ' pointin ' finger along the line of the road . You got three lines on your finger , don'tcha ' ? Each one 's an inch . So how many inches to Childress ?
PHILLIP: One , two six .
BUTCH: Yer ' a helluva ' navigator , Phillip . A lot smarter than Jerry . But I guess that 's not sayin ' a lot . Something catches Phillip 's eye .
PHILLIP: Lookie there !
BUTCH: Seen one of them in a magazine . It 's called a motor home . They 're new . Kinda ' like a house on wheels .
SALLY: You said the boy stole a Halloween costume What character ?
ADLER: I believe it was Casper Casper the friendly ghost .
SALLY: That was them . They just passed us .
RED: Turn this thing around ! Adler jumps on the radio to the truck .
ADLER: Turn it around ! That was them !
SUTTLE: It 's it 's not safe to go over 65 with this much load !
BOBBY LEE: Tell him to pull up next to 'em ! Bobby Lee opens a window and leans out .

SALLY: He was laughing and waving .
RED: Do n't tell 'em that .
AIDE: They say the boy looked A-okay .
GOVERNOR: He 'll be fine , Mrs. Perry . This whole nightmare will be over and done with very soon and you 'll be home with your boy . I promise .
GOVERNOR: I want you to know that I personally okayed the use of a brand-new high-tech mobile home from which to conduct the manhunt . It 's an amazingly futuristic piece of law enforcement equipment . Another FLASH .
BUTCH: Started this road 20 years ago and it still ai n't finished . Appears to me we got a decision to make .
PHILLIP: Where we goin ' ?
BUTCH: It 's Alaska , Phillip . Last of the wild frontier .
PHILLIP: It 's pretty .
BUTCH: It 's beautiful !
PHILLIP: You been there ?
BUTCH: Naw . Just got the one postcard . But anyhoo , back to our present dilemma . You feel like a hike ?
PHILLIP: How far ?
BUTCH: Ca n't be more ' n , oh , say , fifteen hundred miles .
BUTCH: Yer ' prolly ' right . Go give our supplies a check .
PHILLIP: A soda some gum half a Moon Pie .
BUTCH: Rations for one at best . Come on .
BRADLEY: Now yer sure that gooseneck had a safety chain ? Suttle turns and glares .
SUTTLE: Yes ! ! !
ADLER: Governor 's hot line , Red . Governo insists that he have the mobile home ack for the parade tomorrow .
RED: Tell 'em to come and get it .
PHILLIP: Where we goin ' ?
BUTCH: We 're goin ' trick r ' treatin ' , Phillip .
PHILLIP: We ai n't allowed to trick r ' treat .
BUTCH: Huh ?
PHILLIP: My mama do n't allow it .
BUTCH: Trick r ' treatin ' ? Why not ?
PHILLIP: Against our religion .
BUTCH: Against yer ' religion . What kind of foolishness is that ?
PHILLIP: Jehovah Witness .
BUTCH: Now , I 'm askin ' you , Phillip . I ai n't askin ' yer ' mother and I ai n't askin ' Jehovah . Do you wan na ' go trick r ' treatin ' or not ?
PHILLIP: Trick r ' treat .
BUTCH: Say it again , Phillip .
PHILLIP: Trick r ' treat , ma'am .
WOMAN: Well , seein ' that Halloween was yesterday , I guess you 'll have to trick me . You missed the caramel popcorn balls I made up special .
PHILLIP: Thankyew .
BUTCH: Never underestimate the kindness of the common man , Phillip .
ADLER: Spur 208 northbound . And 83 at Aspermont coming and going . That it ?
RED: Yeah .
BUTCH: You sure there 's no meat in there ? Spam maybe , Vienna sausages , anything like that ?
PHILLIP: Nawsir .

PHILLIP: Yeahsir .
BUTCH: Well go to it .
PHILLIP: How many ?
BUTCH: Many as you want .

EMERGENCY BRAKE: slips a little , then gives all at once .
FORD: starts to roll backwards .
PHILLIP: Whooaaa ! Butch ! Butch ! ! !
FORD: swerves off the road and onto the shoulder .
BOB'S WIFE: Forget the car , Bob !
BOB: Are you crazy . It 's only got a 1000 miles on it !
BOB: That was close .
BOB: Bob Fielder .
BUTCH: Edgar Poe .
BOB: Had me scared silly . I 've only had he two months .
BUTCH: She 's a beaut , all right . Say , Bob , what
BUTCH: The brake , Phillip ! Step on the brake ! Hard !
BUTCH: Helluva job , Phillip ! Never had a doubt .
BUTCH: No trouble at all , Bob .
BOB: Why the roadblock , Officer ?
OFFICER: Escaped convict , sir . Just a precaution .
RED: What ?
ADLER: They 've got two Highway Patrol cars they can give to us now .
RED: Tell 'em stand by . We got the best seat in the house right here . Have the southern roadblocks call in the dogs and move north . Check every road , every farm from San Angelo to Sweetwater .
ADLER: He knows he 's hemmed in . I predict we 'll have him singing a different tune by nightfall .
BOB'S SON: You 're spilling ! You 're spilling ! Bob and his Wife immediately turn around .
WIFE: Patsy ! Look at what you 're doing ? !
BOB: Ahhh noooo !
BOB'S WIFE: Look at what you did ! It 's all ove the seat of your father 's new car !
BOB'S WIFE: Damn that kid !
BOB: It 's okay , sweetie . Daddy 's not mad .
BOB'S WIFE: So much for the new car smell . The little girl muffles her tears .
BUTCH: This will do fine right here , Bob . But I do have one more favor to ask .
BOB: Please , it 's new . Hold it under 45 at least for the next 500 miles .
BUTCH: You know I will , Bob .
PHILLIP: They look funny .
BUTCH: Maybe , but Bob did the right thing . What if he 'd put up a fight ? I mighta ' had to shoot him , and where would that family be then ? Naw , Bob 's a fine family man and that 's about the best thing a fella ' can hope to be .
ADLER: He got through ! At Aspermont .
BRADLEY: What ?
ADLER: Coerced a motorist . Red sighs .
RED: Well goddam , shout at Amarillo . Tell 'em we got a notion he 's headed their way . Adler gets right to it .
RED: Truth is I wish he 'd cross the border so we could turn this over to the feds . Nobody in the room expected to hear this .
SUTTLE: Well , uh Adler jumps up and goes to the frig .
ADLER: Got T-bones in the frig , Red !
SUTTLE: Uh , uh , those were stocked for the Governor . I do n't think that he would approve of
ADLER: And look , Red ! Tater Tots ! Those kind you like ! Red turns and looks .
RED: That so ?
BUTCH: Ca n't find a Coonass Waltz to save my ass . Hey , Phillip , that stuff you told me 'bout not trick r ' treatin ' causa ' Jehovah Was you pullin ' my leg ?

PHILLIP: You mad at me ?
BUTCH: No . More silence .
PHILLIP: You kissed her , huh ?
BUTCH: Jus ' barely .
PHILLIP: Why ?
BUTCH: Caus ' it feels good . Ai n't you ever seen your mama kiss a man ?
PHILLIP: No . You kissed her backside , huh ?
BUTCH: It 's , well , uh , it 's kinda ' hard to explain . I know how it musta ' looked . Hell , I do n't know how it looked .
PHILLIP: Do you love her ?
BUTCH: Who ?
PHILLIP: The lady that cooked the hamburgers ?
BUTCH: Yeah , Phillip , I love her . Kissed her butt did n't I ? And they both start to laugh .
PHILLIP: I wan na ' go home .
BUTCH: If you wanted to go home so bad , why did n't you stay at that store today ?
PHILLIP: Caus ' .
BUTCH: Caus ' why ?
PHILLIP: 'Caus ' I stole . They 'd put me in jail . Prolly ' go to hell . Butch chuckles at the notion .
BUTCH: Same difference . We 'll get you home soon . I swear , okay ?
PHILLIP: Butch ?
BUTCH: Yeah , Phillip ?
PHILLIP: I can drive .
BUTCH: Done proved that ain'tcha ' ? There 's lots and lots of stuff you can do , Phillip . Reach in that glovebox there . See if Bob 's got a notepad or something . Phillip extracts a small ringed memo pad .
PHILLIP: I can print .
BUTCH: Good enough . Now I want you to make a list of everything you ever wanted to do ut was n't allowed to . Okay ?
PHILLIP: Like what ?
BUTCH: Like cotton candy .
PHILLIP: Cotton candy ?
BUTCH: Hell I do n't know . It 's yer ' list .
PHILLIP: Butch ?
BUTCH: Yeah ?
RED: Figger to give 'em another hour of shuteye , then grab the patrol cars and head for the Panhandle .
SALLY: Bring back any memories ?
RED: Too many .
SALLY: It 's the 60 's , Red . They 've got a file on everybody .
RED: Just caus ' it 's written down do n't make it true .
SALLY: You worked as County Sheriff in Amarillo and Austin before you became a Ranger . Right so far ? Oh , and it says your name 's Cecil .
RED: Yeah , well , that 's definitely the worst of it .
SALLY: Strong but good . So Cecil Red gives her a strong look .
RED: The file do n't tell ya ' that , too ?
SALLY: Nope .
RED: I got a ranch I never visit , nieces I hardly know , a tackle box full of dry lures and a dog that figures he 's the owner and I 'm the pet . Could have a point , he 's there more .
SALLY: A confirmed bachelor . Any regrets ?
RED: Liked to have wet those lures . Maybe a new dog . How 'd you get into whatever the hell it is you do ?
SALLY: My father 's defense lawyer .
RED: That explains your mouth . Sally smiles .
SALLY: Instead of Home Ec , I studied Criminology . When I graduated , my father , with the Governor 's help , they , he and my dad I created a position for myself with the prison system .
RED: What 's yer ' husband think about all this ?
SALLY: Do n't own one .
RED: Yer ' not careful you 'll wind up jus ' like me . Old , tired , with nobody around to love ya ' .
SALLY: Maybe .
RED: It 's crazy ai n't it ?
SALLY: What 's that ?
RED: Goin ' without sleep chasin ' after a three time loser and Casper the Friendly Ghost ?
SALLY: Sleep ? That 's what retirement 's for .
RED: Bite your tongue .
SALLY: You wan na ' know what 's really crazy ? Hayne 's juvenile court record lists you as Amicus Curiae . Silence save the CRICKETS .
SALLY: Friend of the court . Evidence given by a non-party with the intention of swaying the judge one way or the other . They 're usually in written form , but there 's no copy attached . Red does n't flinch .
RED: What 's your file say about him ?
SALLY: That he was a petty thief who did a little time , got out and stayed pretty clean .
RED: There are murderers I 'd trust with my mother and petty thieves I would n't turn my back on . Your precious files are wrong .
SALLY: I 'm listening .
RED: Hayne 's old man was a career criminal with a soft spot for whores . One way o the other he beat the hell outta ' every person he ever crossed , screwed o fathered . Judge sends junior home with the old man and you can bet your last dollar that within a year he 'll have a ap sheet as long as yer arm . I know kids who did Gatesville , made it through , shaped up . Hell , one 's even a priest . Sally realizes she 's opened an old wound .
SALLY: Still , I do n't understand from the file why
RED: This job ai n't about files and books and second guessin ' . Ya get one shot and ya call 'em like you see 'em .
SALLY: I 'm a bit confused Red tosses out the rest of his coffee .
RED: In Texas the bottom line is who ya ' know and what they owe ya . That 's how I do my job and how you got yours . He turns to walk inside .
SALLY: What are you trying to say ? Red stops , faces Sally .
RED: I bought the judge a T-bone and told him to send the boy up . Told him it was the right thing to do . He went along right down the line .
BUTCH: Me n ' the boy was just catchin ' some shut-eye in yer ' field .
MACK: Oh , it ai n't mine . I just works it fo Mr. Andrews . Where ya 'll from ?
BUTCH: Drove from Texarkana yesterday .
MACK: Quite a haul .
BUTCH: Said a mouthful there .
MACK: Well , ai n't no sense in ya 'll sleepin ' in the car . Not when I got a fold out couch sittin ' empty .
BUTCH: Would n't want to put you out . 'Sides we need to get back on the road .
MACK: No trouble t'all . Wake you up first light , fill yer ' belly and send you on yer ' way .
SAUNDERS: We did n't pass it did we ? Saunders spots the RV on the horizon .
MONTGOMERY: There it is .
SAUNDERS: Where are they ? !
SUTTLE: Uh , uh , they 're gone .
SAUNDERS: How long ? !
SUTTLE: I do n't know , uh , four , five hours .
SAUNDERS: Well , goddammit , did he say anything ?
SUTTLE: Yeah .
SAUNDERS: What ? !
SUTTLE: Well , uh , Chief Garnett wanted me to tell you that the vehicle gets his seal of approval . Saunders ' face begins to turn red .
PHILLIP: Aaaayyyyy !
CLEVE: Aaaayyyy ! ! !
BUTCH: Aaaayyyyy ! ! ! !
LOTTIE: He wake ya 'll up ? Now I told ya not to do that .
BUTCH: No harm , Ma'am .
LOTTIE: I 'm Lottie . Mack 's wife . This here 's my grandbaby , Cleveland .
CLEVE: Name 's Cleve . I 'm six .
PHILLIP: I 'm eight . Mine 's Buzz .
CLEVE: We got us a creek down the way . Wan na go later ?
PHILLIP: Sure thing . Mack enters after a hard night 's work .
BUTCH: Mornin ' to ya .
MACK: Mornin ' . Rest done ya 'll some good .
LOTTIE: You wan na plate ?
MACK: Not jus ' yet . Boy , go get my thermos from the truck .
JONES: Want me to stay on Highway 70 ?
RED: Let 's head on over towards Amarillo . We 'll cross him there or wave goodbye at the border .
CLEVE: Agin ' ! Do it agin ' !
LOTTIE: Where 's the boy 's mother ?
BUTCH: We left her at home this time . Boy 's night out kinda thing . Butch spots an old phonograph .
LOTTIE: Mr. Andrews give 'em to us when he got hisself a newfangled one . Butch finds a particular favorite .
BUTCH: Jeezus . Now this is music . You know how long it 's been since I heard this .
LOTTIE: That 's an oldie all right . Mrs. Andrews ' maiden name was Bougeois half-Creole herself she is , but Mr. Andrews he do n't like nobody to know . 'Suppose that 's why he give 'em to us .
BUTCH: You dance , Lottie ?
LOTTIE: Lawd goodness no .
BUTCH: Here , jus ' follow me .
LOTTIE: Mr. Poe , you sure can move .
BUTCH: Oughta be able to . Was raised in a dime a dance whorehouse .
LOTTIE: Yer ' foolin ' me ?
BUTCH: No , ma'am . My mama would dance thei asses out of the fryin ' pan and into the ack room fire .
LOTTIE: Well go on !
BUTCH: Dance , boys !
BUTCH: We 'll be leavin ' soon enough . I 'll kill all of you if you try anything stupid . Mack swallows hard .
LOTTIE: What 's Texarkana like ? I ai n't neve een there .
PHILLIP: Oh , it 's real nice . I got a dog named Phillip and a tree house and
BUTCH: Come on , Buzz . Time for us to hit the oad .
LOTTIE: Whass ' wrong , Mack ? You look like you seen a ghost .
CLEVE: Do me agin ' !
MACK: No ! Boy ! Get over by yer ' Mammaw !
CLEVE: Come on , Mister , do me agin ' !
BUTCH: Why 'd ya ' wan na ' go and hit Cleve for ? He did n't move fast enough for ya ' , is that it ? Or maybe he gets excited sometimes and do n't hear everything ya ' say ? You make me sick to my stomach .
PHILLIP: I do n't wan na '
BUTCH: Point it !
BUTCH: He do n't trust ya ' no more . You got ta ' earn that , ya ' know ? Put yer ' hands 'tween yer ' legs , son .
MACK: I love you .
BUTCH: No , old man . Say it like you mean it .
MACK: This boy know I loves him , mistah ' .
BUTCH: Then say it .
LOTTIE: Please , mistah ' . I got ta ' sense about you . I know you a good man .
BUTCH: Nome ' , I ai n't a good man . Ai n't the worst neither , jus ' a different breed .
BUTCH: Say it , Mack . Do n't cost nuthin ' .
MACK: I love you , Cleve .
BUTCH: Gawd that 's beautiful .
BUTCH: You can go wait in the car or you can watch . Yer ' old enough to think fo yer'self .
LOTTIE: Please , mistah ' , ai n't no use in it .
MACK: We 'll give you ever'thing we got !
LOTTIE: Our Father , which are in heaven , Hallo e thy name
BUTCH: Shhh shhh shhh
LOTTIE: Thy Kingdom come , Lawd , thy will be done here on Earth as it is in Heaven .
BUTCH: Shhh.. shhh
LOTTIE: Say it wif ' me .
BUTCH: Phillip ? .
BUTCH: Thanks for yer ' hospitality . And walks away .
ARCH: What the hell ?
ARCH: Mack ? Lottie ?
BUTCH: That was a helluva ' thing to do , Phillip . You 're a hero . Prolly ' be in all the papers tomorrow , how you saved those folks . Truth is , I do n't think I woulda ' killed 'em . I only killed two people in my whole life . One hurt my mama and one hurt you .
RED: How far ?
JONES: Half-hour tops .
RED: Get on the radio and tell whoever gets there first to play it nice and easy . Sally gives him a look .
RED: Jeezus , who did that ?
ADLER: Guvner , I assume .
SALLY: Not a bad idea .
RED: Go ahead and chopper her in .
SALLY: I did n't mean to pry last night .
RED: Yes , ya did .
SALLY: Look , Red , it was 20 years ago .
RED: Funny thing . When the judge sent him away the kid stared at me . Like he knew . Not hard or mad like you 'd expect . It was It was like he was forgiving me .
SALLY: Forgiving you for what ? ! For looking at the facts and doing what you thought was right ?
RED: Naw . For what 's gon na happen today .
BUTCH: What say we talk this over ? Settle things man to man . Then we can be on our way . I 'll even let you drive . Knock that right off yer ' list . How 'd that be ?
ARCH: That 's his car . Took off on foot . He 's got a pistol . Mack says it looks like a
BUTCH: Alaska , Phillip . Wild and wooley . Man against nature . Me personally , I like them odds . Did I tell you my daddy lives there ? He 's the one that sent the picture postcard . Listen here to what he says about it
BUTCH: He useta ' pat me on the head and tell folks 'that it 's some that can live life without askin ' about it and it 's others has to know why , and this boy here is one of the latters . ' That 's why I wanted to go up there . To visit the old man , I guess . Prolly ' punch him one first , but then maybe we 'd end up bein ' friends , sit down , have a eer , talk things over .
PHILLIP: I 'm sorry .
BUTCH: I know ya ' are . Truth is , if it had to happen , I 'm glad it was you . As opposed to someone I do n't know , I mean . All things considered , I feel pretty good , though . Could use a beer , though .
PHILLIP: What 's beer taste like ?
BUTCH: Oh , it 's about the best thing there is . You 'd better put that on the list .
SALLY: I think our chances of this thing ending peacefully are good .
PHILLIP: You better run .
BUTCH: Naw , Phillip , I need me a time machine with a loud radio to take me where I 'm goin ' . Walkin 's for squares .
HENDRICKS: Garnett , I 'm Tom Hendricks , F.B.I. , out of the Amarillo office . I understand you have one of our men with you ?
RED: Yeah . You got the area quadroned off ?
HENDRICKS: Water tight . Like a frog 's pussy . Sorry , ma'am .
SALLY: No doubt an observation based on personal experience . Red ca n't help but smile .
RED: You got him spotted ?
HENDRICKS: By the creek , half-mile down the road . I spaced officers in a circle around them 100 yards or so away .
RED: You got any problem with me handling this one ?
HENDRICKS: What say we both handle it ? Red sighs .
RED: Let 's head on down there . Bradley , gim me ' a megaphone .
HENDRICKS: One other thing , Chief . Haynes is wounded . The boy gut-shot him .
RED: Yer ' shittin ' me .
BUTCH: All this for me . I 'm touched , but I 'm afraid ya 'll gon na ' have to back it up a step or two . I 'm headed to Mexico . Lyin ' to 'em , of course .
RED: Hate to tell ya ' , Butch , but yer ' headed the wrong direction . Tell ya ' what . You let the boy go and we 'll talk about it . Discuss it over a cold beer .
BUTCH: Beer . What 'd I tell ya ' . Appreciate the offer , Cap ' n , but ya ' know I ca n't do that . If you and yer ' pals back outta ' here , I 'll drop the boy at the border . If you do n't I 'll shoot him in the head . I mean it !
PHILLIP: Threw it in the well .
BUTCH: Good thinkin ' .
ADLER: Ya ' think he means it ?
RED: What do you think ?
SALLY: Based on what 's happened the past two days I do n't think he would .
RED: One thing 's for sure . If he gets outta ' here with the boy , we 're right back to where we started .
BRADLEY: If he kills the boy he 'll get the chair .
ADLER: Shit , he 'll get the chair anyway . He 's killed two in two days .
SALLY: We do n't know that he pulled the trigge on either of the innocent victims .
ADLER: Well he was n't at home in his Strat-O- Lounger . 'Sides , who killed Pugh ? Casper ?
RED: All right , both of you , that 's enough ! From the trail of blood I got a feelin ' it ai n't gon na ' make any difference . Let 's jus ' concentrate on gettin ' the oy out for now .
BOBBY LEE: Where ya ' want me , sir ?
RED: Can you shoot off a hood ? Bobby Lee nods .
ADLER: That 'd be the boy 's mother .
RED: Bring her on over .
BUTCH: See , Phillip , dreams do come true . There 's yer ' rocketship .
PHILLIP: Think I 'll get to ride it ?
BUTCH: Today 's the day .
PHILLIP: It 's my mama . Phillip still cranes his neck to see .
BUTCH: Now that ya ' got yerself a ghost suit , do ya ' think she 'll let ya ' trick r ' treat ?
PHILLIP: I got to do one house . Butch smiles . He has an idea .
BUTCH: Put yer ' mask back on .
RED: Jus ' push the button and talk normal . It SQUAWKS again .
GLADYS: Hullo Hullo . Please , sir , he 's my only son . I 'll give you money , whateve I can . Please , I want to take my boy home ! I want to
RED: Yer ' doin ' fine . We 'll get another one .

BRADLEY: Do n't have another megaphone , Chief .
RED: You all set ?
BOBBY LEE: You say when , I 'll say dead .
RED: You got yer'self a deal . Candy 's waitin ' .
BUTCH: One more thing . His old lady has to swear to take him trick r 'treatin ' every year .
PHILLIP: Butch ?
BUTCH: Gim me that list .
PHILLIP: I wan na ' go home !
BUTCH: And when he gets older he gets to drink eer
PHILLIP: I do n't need beer !
BUTCH: Well it 's on yer ' list . And to go out on dates with girls ! Not on the list , but you 'll thank me later for that little addition . Done that , got to drive , gon na ' ride that ocketship . That 's about it . She 's got ta ' promise or I wo n't let him go !
PHILLIP: I wan na ' go home , Butch . My mama 's not ad ! She gives me those things .
BUTCH: Do n't kid a kidder , Phillip .
RED: It 's a deal !
BUTCH: Make her say it !
PHILLIP: I jus ' wan na ' go home .
BUTCH: Know jus ' how ya ' feel , Phillip .
GLADYS: Phillip knows those things are against our beliefs .
RED: What kinda ' foolishness is that ? She promises !
BUTCH: Make her say it !
GLADYS: I promise !
BUTCH: Can we trust her ?
PHILLIP: She 's a real good mama .
BUTCH: When you get home , hide this . If she 's lyin ' you can buy yer ' own damn eer .
PHILLIP: Yer ' not bad , are you , Butch ?
BUTCH: Yeah . Now , Buzz , listen here . I want ya ' to step out there real slow , keepin ' yer ' paws in the air . Then strut right ove to them cops and yell 'trick r ' treat . ' Got it ?
PHILLIP: What are you gon na ' do ?
BUTCH: Somethin 'll come to mind .
RED: Gim me ' them things .

FRESHMAN GIRL: Shakespeare .

CHARLIE: Thank you , sir , but if my English teache is the only friend I make today , that would be sort of depressing .
BILL: Yeah . I could see that .
CHARLIE: Do n't worry , Mr. Anderson . I 'm okay .
PATRICK: I would happily not take shop
SENIOR BULLY: Hey , Freshman Toad .
DEREK: Mmmm . This chicken paprikash is delicious , Mrs. Kelmeckis .

CHARLIE: That 's okay .
PATRICK: Let it go ! Jesus ! It 's an old joke ! It 's over !
SAM: So , Charlie what are you going to do when you get out of here ?

CHARLIE: You guys look happy together . How long have you been boyfriend and girlfriend ? What ?
SAM: He 's my step-brother . My mom finally left my worthless dad and married his nice dad 3 years ago .
PATRICK: But Sam 's not bitter . Make no mistake .
SAM: Absolutely . I 'm not a bulimic . I 'm a ulim-ist .
CHARLIE: I 'm sorry . I do n't know what that means .
PATRICK: She just really believes in bulimia .
SAM: I love bulimia .
PATRICK: Thanks for paying , Charlie .

AUNT HELEN: Oh . Look at you all , dressed so nice .
CHARLIE: What are you doing ?
CANDACE: Look , I egged him on . You saw it . He 's never hit me before . I promise he 'll never hit me again . She 's about to go back downstairs when
CHARLIE: Like Aunt Helen 's boyfriends ? A silence passes between them . Then
CANDACE: Charlie this is Pony Tail Derek . I can handle him . Will you trust me ? Please , do n't tell mom and dad .
SAM: Oh , my God . They 're playing good music .
PATRICK: Holy shit . They are ! They 're playing good music !
SAM: Living room routine ?
PATRICK: Living room routine !
SAM: God , it 's freezing .
PATRICK: But you wore that toasty costume . It 's not like you 're trying too hard to be original .
SAM: Piss off , Tennessee Tuxedo .
CHARLIE: Are you sure it 's okay that I come ?
SAM: Of course . Just remember , Charlie Bob 's not paranoid .
PATRICK: `` He 's sensitive . ''
BOB: Sam that waitress from the Olive Garden is a tease . Will you marry me ?
SAM: Only if I have Patrick 's blessing .
BOB: Patrick ?
PATRICK: You 're a hopeless stoner who attends the culinary institute . So , I 'm going to have to say `` no '' on that one , but nice try . Charlie ?
BOB: Touché .
PATRICK: Charlie this is a party .
MARY ELIZABETH: Patrick , you 're such a dick .
PATRICK: Where the hell did you go ?
MARY ELIZABETH: The dance was a little boring , do n't you think ?
PATRICK: You 're so selfish . We looked everywhere for you . You could have told someone .
MARY ELIZABETH: Cry me a river .
PATRICK: How is it that you got meaner since
MARY ELIZABETH: Just lucky I guess .
PATRICK: I think you 're doing something wrong .
MARY ELIZABETH: Or something very right .
CHARLIE: Is that Brad Hays ?
ALICE: Yeah . He comes here sometimes .
CHARLIE: But he 's a popular kid .
MARY ELIZABETH: Then , what are we ?
BOB: Charlie , you look like you could use a ownie .
CHARLIE: Thank you . I was so hungry at the dance . I was going to go to King 's , but I did n't eally have any time . Thanks .
MARY ELIZABETH: Charlie , what do you think about high school ?
CHARLIE: High school ? Bullshit . The cafeteria is called the Nutrition Center . And people wear their letter jackets even when it 's 98 degrees out . And why do they give out letters for marching band ? That 's not a sport , and we all know it .
MARY ELIZABETH: This kid is crazy .
CHARLIE: And Mary Elizabeth , I think you 're really going to regret that haircut when you look back at old photographs . I 'm really sorry . That sounded like a compliment in my head .
MARY ELIZABETH: Oh , my God !
ALICE: Well , it 's kind of true .
MARY ELIZABETH: Shut up !
SAM: Bob , did you get him stoned ?
BOB: Come on , Sam . He likes it . Just look at him .
SAM: How do you feel , Charlie ?
CHARLIE: I just really want a milkshake .
SAM: Okay , Charlie . Let me make the milkshake .
CHARLIE: What a great word . Milkshake . It 's like when you say your name over and ove again in the mirror , and after awhile , it sounds crazy .
SAM: I 'm guessing you 've never been high efore ?
CHARLIE: Me ? No . My best friend Michael . His dad was a big drinker . So , he hated all that stuff . Parties , too .
SAM: Well , where is Michael tonight ?
CHARLIE: Oh , he shot himself last May .
SAM: It 's up the stairs .
PATRICK: Charlie ?
BRAD HAYS: Who is that kid ?
PATRICK: Relax . Relax . He 's a friend of mine . Stay here .
CHARLIE: I did n't see anything .
PATRICK: I know you saw something , but it 's okay .
CHARLIE: `` Like a cake . '' That 's what Bob said . And how you ca n't have 3 on a match ecause they would find us . And everyone laughed , but I do n't know what 's funny .
PATRICK: Okay , Charlie , listen . I need you to promise that you 're not going to say anything to anyone about me and Brad . This has to be our little secret .
CHARLIE: Our little secret . Agreed .
PATRICK: Thank you . We 'll talk later .
CHARLIE: I look forward to that big talk .
SAM: I need to talk to you . Charlie just told me that his best friend shot himself . I do n't think he has any friends .
PATRICK: Everyone . Raise your glasses to Charlie .
CHARLIE: What did I do ?
PATRICK: You did n't do anything . We just want to toast our new friend . You see things . And you understand . You 're a wallflower .
PATRICK: Well , we did n't think there were any cool people left to meet . So , everyone
SAM: Welcome to the island of misfit toys .
PATRICK: Right ? I have no idea .
SAM: Have you heard it before ?
CHARLIE: Never .
SAM: Wait ! Let 's go through the tunnel !
PATRICK: Sam , it 's freezing .
SAM: Patrick , it 's the perfect song !
PATRICK: No . Mama Patrick says no .
SAM: Patrick , it 's Sam . It 's Sam talking to you , I 'm begging you to drive me
PATRICK: Alright ! I concede !
CHARLIE: What is she doing ?
PATRICK: Do n't worry . She does it all the time .
SAM: Turn it up !
PATRICK: You got it , your highness .
CHARLIE: I feel infinite .
AIR SUPPLY: I 'm lying alone with my head on the phone , thinking of you 'til it hurts .
CHARLIE: When he was a junior , Patrick started seeing Brad on the weekends in secret . I guess it was hard , too , because Brad had to get drunk every time they fooled around .
PATRICK: Whatever happened to Fae Wray ? That delicate , satin draped frame ? As it clung to her thigh , how I started to cry 'cause I wanted to be dressed just the same .
ALICE: It 's gorgeous , Craig . What did you use ?
CRAIG: Color film , but black and white paper fo the printing . My professor gave me an `` A , '' but for the wrong reasons . Most of them are idiots . You 'll see what I mean when you get to college . How were you SAT 's by the way ?
ALICE: 1150 . I think I 'll get into NYU .
CRAIG: Yeah , I hope so .
MARY ELIZABETH: 1490 . Harvard . Face !
CHARLIE: Hey . Are you okay ?
SAM: Yeah . Yeah . But I got my SAT results ack . Oops .
CHARLIE: You can take them again .
SAM: Yeah , it 's just if I 'm going to Penn State main campus , I have to do much etter . I wish I would have studied freshman year . I was a bit of a mess .
CHARLIE: I 'll help you study for the next one .
SAM: Will you ?
CHARLIE: Yeah , of course .
SAM: Thanks , Charlie .
CHARLIE: Just a mix tape . No big deal . My parents have a pretty good stereo . It 's all about that night in the tunnel . I could n't find that song we were listening to , but I 'm still searching for it , so
SAM: It 's okay . These are great . You have eally good taste , Charlie .
CHARLIE: Really ?
SAM: Yeah . Way better than me as a freshman . I used to listen to the worst top 40 .
CHARLIE: No .
SAM: Yeah , I did . But then I heard this old song . Pearly Dew Drops Drop . And I thought someday I would be at a party in college or something . And I 'd look up and see this person across the room . And from that moment , I 'd know everything was going to be okay . You know what I mean ?
CHARLIE: Yeah .
ALICE: So , what do you think ?
PATRICK: I do n't know .
ALICE: I hope it works out . Craig would be a ig step up from her last boyfriend .
MARY ELIZABETH: No , shit . Who could forget Mr . Car Wash Loser ?
PATRICK: I just hope she stops playing dumb with these guys . I keep telling her do n't make yourself small . You ca n't save anybody .
CRAIG: Man , your mix is morbidly sad , kid . How about something a little more upbeat ?
CHARLIE: Yeah .
ALICE: Do n't you write poetry , Craig ?
CRAIG: No . Poetry writes me . You know ?
BILL: Wow . That was fast . You want anothe one ?
CHARLIE: Mr. Anderson can I ask you something ?
BILL: Yeah .
CHARLIE: Why do nice people choose the wrong people to date ?
BILL: Are we talking about anyone specific ?
CHARLIE: Can we make them know they deserve more ?
BILL: We can try . Charlie smiles .
SAM: Hey , Charlie .
CHARLIE: Hey , Sam . I did n't see you come in . You want to work on probabilities and statistics ?
FATHER: 20 dollars ? What do you want 10 dollars for ?
CHARLIE: Sam is doing secret santa . It 's he favorite thing in the world . Please .
FATHER: Have fun .
CHARLIE: Thanks .
BILL: Charlie this was my favorite book growing up . This is my copy , but I want you to have it .
CHARLIE: Thanks .
BILL: Have a great Christmas break .
CHARLIE: You too , Mr. Anderson .
MR. CALLAHAN: Terrible stain .
PATRICK: If you fail me , you get me next semester .
SAM: Below average !
MARY ELIZABETH: Multiple pairs of blue jeans . Wow . This is a really tough one , but I 'm going to have to guess Alice .
PATRICK: Impossible !
MARY ELIZABETH: I 'm so touched .
CHARLIE: Where 's Craig ?
SAM: He went home to Connecticut . He 'll be ack for New Year 's Eve .
CHARLIE: I 'm sorry we wo n't be seeing him tonight .
SAM: Alright , big brother by 3 weeks . Who 's your secret santa ?
PATRICK: I 'll tell you , Sam . This one 's tough . I have received a harmonica , a magnetic poetry set , a book about Harvey Milk , and a mix with the song `` Asleep '' on it twice .
SAM: Alright , Charlie it 's your turn .
CHARLIE: Okay . Uh , I have received socks , pants , a shirt , and a belt . I was ordered to wear them all tonight . So , I 'm guessing my secret santa is Mary Elizabeth .
PATRICK: Huh . Now , why do you say that ?
CHARLIE: I do n't know . She bosses people around sometimes .
MARY ELIZABETH: What the hell is wrong with you ?
CHARLIE: Sorry .
PATRICK: Well , you 'll be surprised to know that your secret santa is actually me .
CHARLIE: You got me clothes ? Why ?
PATRICK: Because all the great writers used to wear great suits . Your last present is on a towel rack in the bathroom . Delve into our facilities . Emerge a star . Charlie gives Sam a sack of presents .
CHARLIE: Can you hand these out while I 'm gone ?
MARY ELIZABETH: Wait a second . There 's only secret santa presents . There are rules , Charlie .
PATRICK: Mary Elizabeth , why are you trying to eat Christmas ? Hand them out , Sam .
ALICE: `` Alice , I know you 'll get into NYU . ''
MARY ELIZABETH: 40 dollars . `` To print Punk Rocky in color next time . ''
BOB: He knows me . He really knows me .
SAM: Come on out , Charlie .
PATRICK: Yeah ! What a display of man I have eve seen ! Sam and Charlie look at each and smile .
CHARLIE: Where are we going ?
SAM: It 's a surprise .
CHARLIE: Is this your room ? It 's so cool .
SAM: Thanks .
CHARLIE: You got me a present ?
SAM: With all that help on my Penn State application ? Of course I did . Open it .
CHARLIE: I do n't know what to say .
SAM: You do n't have to say anything .
CHARLIE: That 's okay . I 'm just sorry you have to go back and visit your dad .
SAM: I 'm in such a great mood , I do n't think even he could ruin it . I feel like I 'm finally doing good .
CHARLIE: You are .
SAM: Me ? What about you ? When I met you , you were this scared freshman . And look at you in that suit . You 're like a sexy English school boy . I saw Mary Elizabeth checking you out .
CHARLIE: No .
SAM: Innocent . Worst kind of guys . Never see you coming . And parents love you . That 's like extra danger .
CHARLIE: Well , it has n't worked so far .
SAM: Come on . You 've never had a girlfriend ? Not even a 2nd grade valentine ? He shakes his head .
CHARLIE: No . What about you ?
SAM: Have I ever kissed a girl ?
CHARLIE: No ! Your first kiss
SAM: My first kiss ? I was 11 . His name was Robert . He would come over to the house all the time .
CHARLIE: Was he your first boyfriend ?
SAM: He was my dad 's boss . Charlie goes silent .
CHARLIE: It 's true . You can do it .
CHARLIE: My Aunt she had that same thing done to her , too . And she turned her life around .
SAM: She must have been great .
CHARLIE: She was my favorite person in the world until now . Sam smiles . She 's very moved .
SAM: Charlie , I know that you know I like Craig . But I want to forget that for a minute . Okay ? I just want to make sure that the first person who kisses you loves you . Okay ?
CHARLIE: I love you , too .
GANG: `` Merry Christmas ! '' `` Good luck at you dad 's ! '' `` See you at New Year 's ! '' Patrick approaches Charlie in the doorway .
CHARLIE: Have a good time at your mom 's .
PATRICK: Thanks . And Charlie since you were orn on Christmas Eve , I figure you do n't get a lot of birthday presents . So , I thought you should have my clock . From the heart .
CHARLIE: Thank you , Patrick .
PATRICK: I love you guys !
FATHER: Hey ! Look who 's here !
CHRIS: Come here , little sister .
CANDACE: Hey , Chris .
CHRIS: Ma , you look so thin !
MOTHER: 10 pounds Weight Watchers .
CHRIS: Charlie
MOTHER: Make a wish , honey .
AUNT HELEN: Can you see it , Charlie ? The luminaria is a landing strip for Santa Claus .
CHARLIE: Hey .
CHRIS: Hey . God , I missed mom 's cooking . You have no idea how good you have it . I 'm actually beginning to hate pizza .
CHARLIE: How are you liking school ?
CHRIS: Not bad . I 'm no brainiac like you o Candace . But I 'm doing okay .
CHARLIE: Okay ? You 're playing in a Bowl Game .
CHRIS: How are you feeling , Charlie ?
CHARLIE: Good .
CHRIS: You know what I mean . Is it bad tonight ?
CHARLIE: No .
CHRIS: No ?
CHARLIE: I 'm not picturing things anymore . And when I do , I can just shut it off .
CHARLIE: Yeah . Especially Sam . I 'm going to ask her out at New Years . I think the time is right now .
SAM: Shoveling snow , huh ?
CHARLIE: I have to get this driveway clean . Then , I have to congratulate you for being happy because you deserve it .
SAM: You said that an hour ago .
CHARLIE: Was that tonight ? God . I was looking at this tree , but it was a dragon , and then
SAM: Okay , Charlie . Do n't freak out . Just give me the shovel . Calm down . Look up .
CHARLIE: Sam , you ever think that if people knew how crazy you really were , no one would ever talk to you ?
SAM: All the time . So , you want to put on these glasses ? They 'll protect you .
PATRICK: 10-9-8
AUNT HELEN: It 'll be our little secret , all right ?
PATRICK: 7-6-5-4-3-2-1 . Happy New Year !
POLICEMAN: Did your older friends pressure you ?
CHARLIE: No one pressured me into anything . I would never do drugs , officer . Never .
POLICEMAN: Then , how did you happen to be passed out on the ground at 6 in the morning ?
CHARLIE: Well , um I was really tired , and uh I was feeling feverish . So , I went outside for a walk , just to get some cold air . And I started seeing things . So , I passed out .
MOTHER: You 're seeing things again , Charlie ?
CHARLIE: Not , uh Not really .
BILL: More fun than you 're going to have today , Sinatra .
MARY ELIZABETH: Well what are we supposed to do ? We 're going on in 10 minutes !
CHARLIE: But they said in health class
BRAD HAYS: They say that about LSD to scare you .
CHARLIE: Are you sure ?
BRAD HAYS: Charlie , you 're fine , man .
MARY ELIZABETH: Guys , we have an emergency . Craig flaked out on us again . I need a Rocky . Brad ?
BRAD HAYS: No way . There are people out here .
MARY ELIZABETH: Charlie take off your clothes .
SAM: So if anything grows while you pose . I 'll oil you up and drop you down . And that 's just one small fraction of the main attraction . You need a friendly hand . And I need action !
CHARLIE: Maybe I could join the cast as an alternate or something ?
MARY ELIZABETH: We 're filled up now , but they 'll need people after we leave for college . I could put in a good word for you .
CHARLIE: That 'd be great . Thanks .
MARY ELIZABETH: Charlie have you heard of the Sadie Hawkins dance ?
CHARLIE: The one where the girl asks the guy .
MARY ELIZABETH: Yeah . Well , obviously , it 's completely stupid and sexist . It 's like , `` Hey , thanks for the crumb . '' And normally , I 'd just blow it off because school dances suck torture . But , you know , it 's my last year , and would you maybe want to go with me ?
CHARLIE: You want to go with me ?
MARY ELIZABETH: I 'm sick of macho guys . And you looked eally cute in your costume . So , what do you say ? Charlie thinks and thinks and
MOTHER: You must be Mary Elizabeth . It 's so good to meet you .
MARY ELIZABETH: You , too , Mrs. Kelmeckis .
FATHER: Charlie tells me you 're a Buddhist .
CHARLIE: Are you having a good time ?
SAM: Not really . How about you ?
CHARLIE: I do n't know . This is my first date , so I do n't know what to compare it to .
SAM: Do n't worry . You 're doing fine .
CHARLIE: I 'm sorry Craig did n't come .
SAM: Yeah . He said he did n't want to go to some stupid high school dance . Ca n't say I blame him .
CHARLIE: I do n't know . If you like it , he should come .
SAM: Thanks , Charlie . Have a beautiful first date . You deserve it .
CHARLIE: I 'll try not to make you too jealous .
MARY ELIZABETH: Mmmm . Now , let it breathe .
CHARLIE: This is sure a nice house .
MARY ELIZABETH: Thanks .
CHARLIE: This merlot is really fancy .
MARY ELIZABETH: Yeah . My dad collects wine , but he does n't drink . That 's weird , is n't it ?
CHARLIE: I guess . Where are your parents ?
MARY ELIZABETH: Their club is hosting a cotillion o something racist . They 'll be gone all night .
CHARLIE: That 's sure a nice fire .
MARY ELIZABETH: Yeah . After I 'm done being a lobbyist , I want to move to a house like this in Cape Cod . That sounds nice , does n't it ?
CHARLIE: Yeah . She reaches out and touches his chest .
MARY ELIZABETH: Your heart is beating really fast .
CHARLIE: Is it ?
MARY ELIZABETH: Here , feel .
CHARLIE: Uh-huh ?
MARY ELIZABETH: Do you like me ?
CHARLIE: Uh-huh .
MARY ELIZABETH: You know what I mean .
CHARLIE: I think so .
MARY ELIZABETH: Do n't be nervous .
CHARLIE: Yeah .
MARY ELIZABETH: I ca n't believe it . You of all people . I just ca n't believe you 're my boyfriend .
CHARLIE: I know .
MARY ELIZABETH: Your first foreign film .
MARY ELIZABETH: Vegans do n't eat butter .
MOTHER: She 's on the phone right now ? Charlie , you have to break up with her .
CHARLIE: I can do that ?
FATHER: For Christ 's sake I need to use the phone !
PATRICK: Who are you talking to ?
BOB: I dare you to kiss Alice .
PATRICK: Get ready , breeder .
CRAIG: Mary Elizabeth ? Samantha told me that you got into Harvard . Congratulations .
MARY ELIZABETH: Thank you . This one still has n't gotten me flowers . But I forgive you .
CRAIG: Do n't worry about Penn State . You 're just wait-listed .
PATRICK: Excuse me , everyone , but you 're missing some hot `` fag on goth '' action .
CHARLIE: Truth .
PATRICK: How is your first relationship going ?
CHARLIE: It 's so bad that I keep fantasizing that one of us is dying of cancer , so I do n't have to break up with her .
PATRICK: Charlie ? Truth or dare ? Charlie blinks . It was all fantasy .
CHARLIE: Dare .
PATRICK: I dare you to kiss the prettiest girl in the room on the lips . Notice I charitably said girl and not person ecause let 's face it I 'd smoke all you bitches .

CHARLIE: Fine ! Okay . Your turn .
PATRICK: Yeah , I 've got one . Well , there was this one guy . Queer as a 3 dollar bill . Guy 's father did n't know about his son . So , he comes down into the basement one night when he 's supposed to be out of town . Catches his son with another boy . So , he starts beating him . But not like the slap kind . Like the real kind . And the boyfriend says , `` Stop . You 're killing him . '' And the son just yells `` Get out . '' And eventually the boyfriend just did .
CHARLIE: I do n't know .
PATRICK: Forget it . I 'm free now , right ? I could meet the love of my life any second now . Things will be different now , and that 's good . I just need to meet a good guy .

CHARLIE: Yeah . So , uh , I know it 's none of my usiness , but have you decided are you going to New York ?
BILL: Well , my wife and I like it here , and I think I might be better at teaching than writing . Charlie is relieved . Bill is staying .

CHARLIE: I , uh , I just did n't think you wanted that .
SAM: Well , what did you want ?
CHARLIE: I just want you to be happy .

RACHEL: How can you call it a good thing ? A graveyard for pets killed in the oad ! Built and maintained by broken- hearted children !

JUD: Wellthey have to learn about death somehow , now do n't they , Missus Creed ? The little ones ? RACHEL Why ?
ELLIE: It 's okay , Mr. Crandall
LOUIS: Have you got a death-wish , Ellen ?

ELLEN: `` Spot a good fellow we love you boy . '' `` Owned by JudsonJudson '' Gee , I ca n't read the rest .
JUD: Last name 's Crandall , little missy .
ELLIE: WellI guess not .
JUD: It 's a place where the dead speak , Missy .

ELLIE: What if you ca n't read what 's written on there anymore ?
JUD: Well , it still says some animal got laid down here after , do n't it ?
ELLIE: Yes
LOUIS: And that someone cared enough about that animal to mark the spot .
ELLIE: To remember . JUD Yes . To remember . This ai n't a scary place , Ellie . It 's a place of rest and speaking . Can you remember that ? ELLIE Yes , sir .
LOUIS: My wife is not crazy about cemeteries of any kind . As you may have noticed .
JUD: Me neither . But I believe in knowing your enemy .
ELLIE: Daddy , that Pet Sematary is there ecause of the road , is n't it ? LOUIS looks around at her , surprised .
LOUIS: Well , it 's always better to take precautionsbut I 'm sure Church will be all right , honey
ELLIE: In the end he 's gon na croak , is n't he ?
LOUIS: LoveyChurch might be still alive when you 're in a high schooland that 's a very long time .
ELLIE: It does n't seem long to me . It seems short . I think the whole thing about pets dying s-s-sucks !
LOUIS: If it was up to me I 'd let Church live to be a hundredbut I do n't make up the rules . ELLIE Well who does ? God , I suppose . But he 's not God 's cat ! He 's my cat ! Let God get His own , if He wants one ! Not mine ! Not mine ! Not
RACHEL: She 's finally asleep .
LOUIS: She was a little over-excited , that 's all . Poor kid .
RACHEL: It was that place . That creepy cemetery up in the woods . Whatever disease the kids in this town have got , I do n't want Ellie to catch it .
LOUIS: Jesus , Rachel , what 's got into you ?
RACHEL: Do you think I did n't hear her tonight , crying as if her heart would break ? Here she is thinking Church is going to die .
LOUIS: Rachelsomeday Church is going to die . RACHEL That is hardly the point ! Church is not going to die today , or tomorrow Never mind . I can see you do n't have the slightest idea what I 'm talking about .
ELLIE: Yee-uck ! Gross !
LOUIS: He ca n't help it , babe . Emily Post is going to be beyond him for a few years .
ELLIE: I do n't want him to get his nuts cut , daddy ! What if he dies ?
LOUIS: Good God ! Where 'd you hear that ?
ELLIE: Missy Dandridge . And she says it 's a operation !
RACHEL: Honey , Church will be fine .
ELLIE: But what if he dies and has to go to the Pet Sematary ?
RACHEL: Do n't be silly . Church is not going to die .
LOUIS: According to what Mr. Crandall says , the oad 's a lot more dangerous than the operation . Church will be just the same . Wellalmost the sameand we wo n't have to worry about him getting turned into catburgers by one of those damn Orinco trucks .
RACHEL: That 's enough of that kind of talk !
LOUIS: I just said
RACHEL: I know what you just said . Ellie , clear your place . ELLIE goes slowly back to the table . ELLIE I 'm scared . What if school here is n't like in Chicago ! I 'm scared and I want to go h-h-home !

RACHEL: Do n't shilly-shally , Louis . Give the little girl her promise . LOUIS Church will be fine . I promise .

MISSY: It 'll pass . They always do . She starts toward the house with the sheets .
RACHEL: Thank God . I was a little worried there . Have a great first day at school , doc . No broken bones . LOUIS Not so much as a sprain .

LOUIS: Help me hold him . They hold PASCOW 'S spasming body .
STEVE: It would n't matter if we did have the ambulance .
LOUIS: It would n't matter if we had the SST . PASCOW begins to quiet .
CHARLTON: It wo n't
LOUIS: I know it wo n't ! But let 's for God 's sake do it by the rules !
LOIS: There was n't even supposed to be a sprain today , my friendthat 's what I told her .

PASCOW: The door must not be opened . The arrier must not be crossed . Do n't go on , doc . No matter how much you feel you have to . There 's more power here than you know . He points at
LOUIS: Please , I want to wake up . Leave me alone . It 's not my fault you died ; you were as good as dead when they brought you in
PASCOW: The power of this place is old and always restless . Sometimes the dead do more than speak . Remember , doc .
LOUIS: Leave me alone !
PASCOW: Remember .
LOUIS: Getting there .
RACHEL: I got eggs down here !
LOUIS: Good d He throws the covers back and freezes .
JUD: Did you tell me Rachel took the kids back to Chicago for a few days ?

JUD: You going to bury him in the Pet Sematary ? LOUIS I guess that 's what it 's there for , huh ?
LOUIS: I do n't know .
JUD: Seems like you told me about a promise you made
LOUIS: Maybe when they call I 'll just tell Ellie I have n't seen the damn cat around . You know ? JUD Maybe there 's a better way .
JUD: It 's going to be dark before we even get where we 're going , Louis . But we can do itand we 're going to .
LOUIS: But
JUD: Does she love the cat ?
LOUIS: Yes , but
JUD: Then come on .
LOUIS: Well , folks , here we are , in Louis Creed Dreamland .
JUD: What say , Louis ?
LOUIS: Nothing . Do we plant him on the outer circle or start a new one ?
JUD: We 're still not where we 're going .
LOUIS: What do you mean ?
JUD: The place we 're going is on the other side of that . He points at the deadfall .
LOUIS: We ca n't climb over that . We 'll break our necks !
JUD: No . We wo n't . I have climbed it a time or two before , and I know all the places to step . Just follow memove easydo n't look downand do n't stop . If you stop , you 'll crash through for sure .

LOUIS: You keep saying that .
JUD: This time I mean it .
LOUIS: Whose burying ground ?
JUD: The Micmac Indians . I brought you here to bury Ellen 's cat .
LOUIS: Why ? For God 's sake , why ?
JUD: I had my reasons , Louis . We 'll talk later . All right ?
LOUIS: I guess sobut
JUD: You want to rest a bit before you start ?
LOUIS: No , I 'm okay . Will I really be able to dig him a grave ? The soil looks thin .
JUD: Soil 's thin , all right . But you 'll manage . He hands him the pick and shovel .
LOUIS: You think so ? He notices the rocks .
JUD: Your cairn .
LOUIS: Does n't look like they last long .
JUD: Do n't worry about that .
LOUIS: Jud , why am I doing all this ?

LOUIS: Food , Churchfood ! SOUND Miaow .
JUD: I most generally do n't start before noon , but this looks like an exception .
LOUIS: What did we do , Jud ?
JUD: Why , saved a little girl from being unhappythat 's all . Drink up , Louis ! LOUIS drinks about half the beer .
LOUIS: I tried to tell myself I buried him alive . You knowEdgar Allan Poe meets Felix the Cat . But
JUD: Would n't wash ?
LOUIS: No . I 'm a doctor . I know death when I see it , and Church was dead . He smells horrible and he uses his claws , but he 's aliveand I feel like I 'm going crazy . It was that place , was n't it ?
JUD: Ayuh . It was the rag-man told me about the placeStanley Bouchard . Us kids just called him Stanny B . He was half Micmac himself . LOUIS drains his beer .
LOUIS: Can I have another one ?
JUD: I guess it would n't hurt . He gets up and goes to the fridge .
LOUIS: Wendigo ?
JUD: Spirit of the north country . Not a good spirit . Wendigos are great liars and tricksters , according to the stories . And if one touches you
LOUIS: You and this old Indian rag-man
JUD: Stanny B. did for me what I did fo you last night , Louis . Only I was n't alone when Spot came back .
LOUIS: How did your mother take it , Jud ? How did she take it when your dog came back from the dead ?
JUD: Well , she was a little upset at first , and that 's why I thought you ought to hold your peace when you talked to your people last nightyou did , did n't you , Louis ?
LOUIS: Yes .
JUD: Why , then , things should be fine .
LOUIS: A little upset is all she was ? Because I 'll tell you , Jud , my brains feel a little like a nuclear reactor on the edge of a meltdown .
JUD: She got used to the idea . Spot lived another four years . He died peacefully in the night that second time , and I uried him in the Pet Sematarywhere his bones still lie .
LOUIS: What ?
JUD: Ellie 's a little scared of death . And the main reason Ellie 's that way is ecause your wife is a lot scared of death . Now you just go ahead and tell me I 'm wrong .
RACHEL: Do n't shilly-shally , Louis . Give the little girl her promise .
PASCOW: The door must not be opened . The arrier must not be crossed .
LOUIS: You do n't understand
PASCOW: Sometimes the dead do more than speak . Remember , doc .
LOUIS: Promise
ELLIE: Daddy ! She runs for him .
LOUIS: Hi , sugar !
ELLIE: Daddy , is Church all right ?
LOUIS: YesI guess so . He was sleeping on the front porch when I left .
ELLIE: Cause I had a bad dream about him . I dreamed he got hit by a car and you and Mr. Crandall buried him in the Pet Sematary . LOUIS That was a silly dream , was n't it ?
LOUIS: Yes .
ELLIE: Because you promised .
LOUIS: I know .
RACHEL: Want to take your son , doc ? LOUIS does . GAGE is ecstatic . LOUIS kisses RACHEL deeply .
LOUIS: I 've noticed it , too . I 'll cough up the money , Ellen .
ELLIE: I hate that smell .
LOUIS: YesI hate it , too .
ELLIE: They 're all turning on their lights ! Daddy , why are they all turning on their lights in the middle of the day ?
JUD: They do it to honor the dead , Ellen .
ELLIE: Is that right , dad ?
LOUIS: Yes . To honor the dead .
JUD: Rachel not feeling well ?
LOUIS: Wella touch of the flu
ELLIE: She 's in bed . She was throwing up . Ever since Mrs. Rogers called and said Missy
LOUIS: That 's enough , Ellen . They 've reached the CREED station wagon .
JUD: Out of the mouths of babes , Louis .
LOUIS: This babe has said enough . He opens the front passenger door .
JUD: Poor Missy . God , I was sorry to hear . I remember when she was no older ' n Ellen there , walking down to the store with her Raggedy Anne doll draggin ' behind her in the dust . I do n't know why God takes someone like her , who should have a bunch of years still in front of them , and lets an old shit like me just go on and on .
LOUIS: My father used to have a saying , Jud `` God sees the truth , but waits . ''
JUD: Ayuhhow is your cat , Louis ?
LOUIS: It 's Ellie 's cat .
JUD: Nope . He 's your cat now .
LOUIS: Ellie ? What 's wrong ?
ELLIE: No more chocolate chip cookies .
LOUIS: Huh ?
ELLIE: Missy made the best chocolate chip cookies in the worldeven Mom said so . Now there wo n't be any more ecause she 's gon na be dead forever !
NEWSCASTER: Bizarre as it may seem , it now seems almost beyond doubt the dead are eturning to eat the living . ELLIE Daddy ?
LOUIS: What 's up , sugar ?
ELLIE: Daddy , do you think Missy Dandridge went to heaven ?
ELLIE: At school Michael McDowell said she was gon na fry in hell . Michael McDowell says all sewersides fry in hell .
LOUIS: Well , I think Michael McDowell is so full of shit he probably squeaks when he walks , my dear .
ELLIE: I won'tis Missy in heaven , do you think ?
LOUIS: I do n't know , honey . Different people elieve all sorts of different things happen to us when we die . Some believe in heaven or hell . Some think we 're orn again as little children
ELLIE: Sure , carnation . Like in that movie you rented , Audrey Rose .
LOUIS: Well , it 's actually reincarnation , but you get the idea . And some people think we just wink outlike a candle flame when the wind blows hard .
ELLIE: Do you believe that ? LOUIS looks toward
LOUIS: I think we go on . I 'm not sure what happens after we die , but yeah I have faith in that .
ELLIE: You believe in it .
LOUIS: Oh , faith 's a little more than just elieving .
ELLIE: I do n't get it .
LOUIS: Well , here we are , sitting in my chair . Do you think my chair will e here tomorrow ?
ELLIE: Yeah , sure .
LOUIS: Then you have faith in that . But we do n't know it will be ; after all , some crazed chair-burglar might break in while we 're away and steal it , right ? ELLIE 'S giggling .
ELLIE: I 'm not tired !
LOUIS: I 'm sure you 're not .
ELLIE: Then why do I have to go to bed ?
LOUIS: Because your mother and I need the rest , sugar . Now buzz . She heads toward the stairs .
RACHEL: I heard you tonight .
LOUIS: I thought maybe you did . I know you do n't approve of the subject eing raised
RACHEL: That 's not true . The subject scares me . Because of Zelda .
LOUIS: Your sister , I know .
RACHEL: Sometimes you 're so good with her , Louisso straight with herthat you make me ashamed of myself .
LOUIS: That 's forgotten .
RACHEL: Not by me , it is n't . I know how adly I acted , how unfair I was . It 's just that I..you know .

JUD: EllieGod does n't do things like that . I know you loved y'brother , but

JUD: You 're thinking of things best not thought of , Louis .
LOUIS: I 'm thinking about going to bed . But he begins pouring the beer into a glass .
JUD: You never asked me if anyone had uried a person up there in the Micmac burying ground
LOUIS: Shit ! Look at this mess !

CHASE: Were you drinking ?
GEOFF: Just out .
CHASE: `` Out . '' Well that 's great , Geoff . Look , I 've been letting you get away with a lot these past few weeks , but I 'm not going to stand for crap like this . I do n't care if it 's Halloween it 's a school night , and if you do this again

DREW: Gus ?
GUS: Found 'em .
AMANDA: Gus , hon . I 'm sorry about tonight . You coming to bed ?
GEOFF: Well ? Drew nods . Geoff 's eyes widen in disbelief .
DREW: Picture this Gus comes down to eakfast and he does n't say a word . He even kind of smiles , like he forgot he hates me . And then you know what he does ? He serves me an extra helping of pancakes I asked him if I was still grounded `` no . '' I asked him if you could spend the night , and he nods . It 's like we 're a family . A real family .
GEOFF: What do you mean ?
DREW: It 's like he 's not Gus anymore . He 's different . You know , like Zowie
MESSAGE MACHINE: Doctor Matthews , this is Elliot Rudman at the university . I 've looked over the blood specimen you sent us on canine Zowie
MOTHER: We saw your sign . Are there any kitties left ?
CHASE: Take your pick . They 're in the oarding area . You can go on ack .
RUDMAN: I said next time it might help if you took the blood sample while the animal was still alive The comment hits Chase out of left field .
CHASE: What ?
RUDMAN: I do n't know what you expected to find , Matthews . There 's nothing wrong with the antigens , nothing to indicate an unusual death
CHASE: Wait , there must be some mix-up . He was the dog is alive .
RUDMAN: Not this dog . There was n't enough oxygen in those red cells to pump life into a flea . Chase is baffled , speechless .
CHASE: Yes why ?
RUDMAN: Because the last person that sent me blood from a dead animal was Yolander
THRU: 112 OMITTED
TODDLER: Where are the kitties ?

YOLANDER: You 'd be so much more interesting with blue eyes
CHASE: I um Chase glances to the right and steps back
CHASE: the pathologist he said that you had reported a simila incident with a cat
YOLANDER: The Creed cat , that 's right . Bastard 's name was `` Church '' . Let me guess . Your dog 's tissue is n't healing , pupils are n't dilating maybe you ca n't find a heartbeat ?
CHASE: Exactly ! I thought it might be some sort of blood condition immune deficiency or Quentin Yolander laughs . It 's disconcerting .
YOLANDER: There 's no `` blood condition . '' The dog is n't sick , it 's dead . And so was Creed 's cat . And so was his wife the night she was killed for the second time
CHASE: Well uh thanks

MARJORIE: Did you ever play that game where you pass a story down a row of people and see how screwed up it gets by the time it 's done ? People say Louis Creed 's son came ack from the dead and it drove him crazy He killed his wife and himself , and that 's the end of story . Anything else belongs in the National Enquirer .
CHASE: I wish I knew .
LIBRARIAN: What are you looking for , Hon .

ARCHIE: Arnold ?
PETULIA: Archie . ?
JUDGE TATE: One at a time . Mr. Miller ?
JOE: Your Honor , since Rockwell Corp. egan construction , the surrounding residential neighborhood has been enshrouded in a cloud of foul-smelling , germ-carrying , pestilent dust . My client is being forced to eathe known carcinogens daily ! Other residents are coming forth on a daily basis to add thei voices of outrage !
ANDREW: Your Honor , I submit there were no complaints until Counselo egan knocking on doors , drumming up business . And the dust , which Counselor refers to , has appeared on only three occasions . Each time it has een examined and the results
JOE: Innocuous ?
ANDREW: Defined by Webster 's as harmless .
JOE: I know what it means . You Honor , imagine how the children in this neighborhood have been made to feel . The pounding of construction ringing in thei ears as this skyscraper , a tribute to mankind 's greed , grows daily , casting an ominous shadow over their lives , filling them with dread even as they are surrounded in a black , toxic fog , blocking out the sun while poisoning their lungs ! And Counselor calls it harmless ? !
ANDREW: Your Honor , Counselor is attempting to portray my client as a hideous manifestation of evil and corruption . But nothing could be further from the truth . Rockwell has generously contributed ten thousand dollars to this neighborhood 's schools , clinics and youth centers ! Granting a estraining order on the construction site will throw hundreds of Philadelphians out of work , and will lend validation to this contemptible and groundless nuisance suit , which speaks directly to the kind of greed and treachery that today is threatening the very fabric of our society . Judge Tate looks skeptically at both lawyers .
JUDGE TATE: Let 's not go off the deep end , gentlemen . I thought we were talking about some dust .
ANDREW: You . Andrew resumes his telephone conversation .
JOE: Right . Miller .
ANDREW: Client of yours ?
JOE: Funny .
TYRONE: Gon na have to start looking fo veins in your feet , sweetheart .
DR. GILLMAN: Andy . Can you stop at my office on your way out ?
ANDREW: Sure .
ANTHEA: up to Tax , on fourteen , and get right back , I need you .
ANDREW: Just the dazzling paralegal I wanted to see .
ANTHEA: I know what that means , and the answer is no . I have a class tonight . Exploit someone else . And since you 've asked
KILLCOYNE: Solid work on the Rockwell situation , Andy . Top-notch .
ANDREW: Thanks , Kenneth . Your exam !
ANTHEA: Thank you . 98 . I got ta go
ANDREW: Ninety-eight ? ! Ninety-eight !
SHELBY: Conference call 's up . They just started the roll call . Here 's the settlement agreement , the ed-lined copy 's on your desk . Need me in there ?
ANDREW: No . Great . Thanks , Shelby . It 's 6 30 , go home .
RACHEL: I 'm late , I have to pick up Amy from her afterschool but I want to talk to you about that Hansen thing .
ANDREW: Catch me later , I 'll be here . And tell Amy , I love he painting , it 's on my wall . Andrew SAILS toward his office .
OPERATOR: Karen Hargreave , representing Lloyd Management Corporation ?
HARGREAVE: Present .
OPERATOR: Andrew Beckett , representing Saunders International ? Andrew punches into the conference call
ANDREW: Present .
SARAH: Hello ?
ANDREW: Hi , Mom . It 's me .
SARAH: Andy ! This is a nice surprise . How are you , hon ?
ANDREW: I 'm fine .
SARAH: What 's Dr. Gillman say ?
ANDREW: Hold on , Mom . There 's no way my client will go along with that .
HARGREAVE: Who 's this ?
ANDREW: Andrew Beckett . Hi , Karen . I 'm sorry I interrupted
SARAH: Are you on one of those conference calls ? I hate when you put me on hold .
ANDREW: Ah hah ! Yes ! Rentworth v. Pennsylvania court of appeals affirms jury award of punitive damages fo wrongful interference with prospective economic elations A SHADOW falls across Andrew . He IGNORES IT .
KENTON: Look at this fucking guy . He 's an animal . Andrew 's hands DO NOT LEAVE the keyboard .
ANDREW: Walter .
SEIDMAN: Are we interrupting , Andy ?
ANDREW: In a word , Bob
SEIDMAN: Charles is right behind me .
ANDREW: I was just about to take a eak . Good evening , Charles .
WHEELER: Andy ? Could you step into my office for a sec ? I feel like firing someone tonight . Andrew throws an arm over Seidman 's shoulder .
ANDREW: We 're gon na miss you around here , Bob
SEIDMAN: Andy 's expressed a keen interest in the Kronos Inc. situation , Charles . Is that correct , Andy ?
ANDREW: The fate of the participants interests me , yes sir .
KENTON: It 's good to be King , hey Charles ?
WHEELER: Kings are out of fashion . I 'd ather be thought of as a enevolent tyrant . It 's an anti-trust action .
ANDREW: It is , and it is n't , Charles . Macrosystem 's new software copies all the best-known elements of Kronos ' spreadsheet program . If they 're allowed to sell it , Kronos will get undersold ight out of business . For me , the legal principle , involved is copyright infringement .
WHEELER: Bearing in mind that Bill Wright , the chairman of MacroSystems , is a close , personal friend of mine which side of this mess would you desire to be on , Andy ? And do n't allow my very tight , personal relationship with Bill to influence your answer in any way . Andrew knows this is a test . And he loves it .
ANDREW: Sorry , Charles , but
KENTON: Why , Beckett ?
ANDREW: Because they deserve to , Walter .
SEIDMAN: Andy , do you know who reps Kronos Inc. ?
ANDREW: Bailey , Brackman .
WHEELER: Get with the program , Andy . As of this evening , about 8 05 this evening , right after the soup course Kronos Incorporated is epresented by Wyant Wheele Hellerman Tetlow and Brown . Or , more specifically , senio associate Andrew Beckett .
ANDREW: Yes !
SEIDMAN: You 'll have to get right on it , Andy , we 're up against the statute of limitations .
ASSOCIATE LAWYER: Tokyo on four , Bob .
SEIDMAN: Great . Excuse me , fellas . Connichiwa . Itsumo osewa ni nari mashita . Arigato gozaimasu . Andrew offers his hand to Walter Kenton .
ANDREW: Thanks , Walter .
KENTON: What 's that on your forehead , pal ?
ANDREW: Whacked with a racquetball . I appreciate your faith in my abilities .
WHEELER: Faith , Andy , is the belief in something for which we have no evidence . It does n't apply to this situation . Go home . I mean , get back to work .
ANDREW: Thanks , Charles .
WHEELER: No sweat , buddy . Smiling , Andrew exits the office .
ANDREW: It 's good to be King .
CHANDRA: Okay . You try . Andrew tries applying makeup to his face .
ANDREW: Chandra ? Do n't you think this color 's a little orange for me ?
CHANDRA: Tahitian Bronze works best on lesions .
ALAN: Think of it as the `` I just back from Aruba '' look .
BRUNO: I got it .
ANDREW: Thanks , Bruno . I 've been out of the office fou days . I do n't want them to think I 've been to the beach . Okay . Check this out .
CHANDRA: You know who you look like , Andy ? That actor , in that movie . Not the one where he was autistic , the one where he dressed up like a lady on a soap opera
ALAN: Dustin Hoffman .
ANDREW: Tootsie !
BRUNO: Right .
CHANDRA: You want to try Light Egyptian ? Suddenly , Andrew winces , gripping his gut .
ANDREW: Excuse me a sec
CHANDRA: Just like my cousin Fredo .
BRUNO: You okay , Andy ?
ANDREW: I think I need to go to the hospital .
MIGUEL: Yeah . Thanks , guys . Miguel puts his arms around Andrew .
ANDREW: Gillman 's out of her office today . I told her to take a day off , and she did , can you believe it ? Did you get someone to cover you class ?
MIGUEL: Do n't worry about it . They took lood ? A specimen ? Andrew holds an empty specimen cup .
ANDREW: Are n't you giving an exam ?
MIGUEL: I said , do n't worry about it .
ANDREW: I almost did n't make it to the bathroom , Miguel . I almost lost control right in front of everybody .
MIGUEL: So what ? It 's nothing to be ashamed of . You have nothing to e ashamed of , okay ?
ANDREW: Wait , here 's my guy Hey !
MIGUEL: Why do you need to do this ?
ANDREW: This is my partner . We keep ecords of hospital visits . Nothing personal .
MIGUEL: It could be parasites , an infection
ANDREW: A reaction to AZT
KLENSTEIN: That 's possible , but .
MIGUEL: He 's not going through some painful procedure until we 've cancelled out everything else .
ANDREW: He 's upset , he 's sorry .
MIGUEL: Do n't apologize for me .
ANDREW: He 's not sorry , okay , fine . Why do n't we see what we find out from the blood work ? I 'll work on getting a specimen , I 'm sure hospital food could help in that direction . Maybe , by then , we 'll hear from my doctor , and we 'll go from there . Okay ? Everybody happy ?
MIGUEL: I 'm sorry . The INTERN walks away . Andrew 's BEEPER BEEPS .
ANDREW: That 's the third time . I bette call the office . Would you relax , please ?
MIGUEL: I am relaxed .
ANDREW: Shelby ? It 's me . Jamey 's been eeping me , I Okay , okay , calm down . Put Jamey on .
JAMEY: Andy ? ! This is a disaster ! We ca n't find your revisions on the Kronos complaint !
ANDREW: Slow down , Jamey , for Christ 's sake !
JAMEY: I went down to Word Processing to pick up the corrected copy , ut they said you have n't delivered the corrections . I told them you 've been working on it at home , and
ANDREW: I brought it in last night , around midnight . It 's in my computer .
JAMEY: What did you file it under ?
ANDREW: K-R-O-one . Jamey types the file name .
JAMEY: It 's not here , Andy .
ANDREW: You go down to Word Processing and tell those motherfuckers they better come up with that complaint , now ! Or they are u > fucking dead ! You tell them that comes from me ! Andrew SLAMS the phone into its cradle .
MIGUEL: Why are you getting dressed ?
ANDREW: You 're not going to like this . Please try to smile Andrew puts his arms around Miguel .
MIGUEL: You 're going to the office ? !
ANDREW: You 're not smiling . Andrew rushes toward the exit doors .
MIGUEL: You 're leaving the hospital ? You 're going into the office looking like that ? Are you insane ?
ANDREW: One hour !
MIGUEL: Drew !
ANDREW: I promise !
ANTHEA: Did n't expect to see you ? He ducks into his office .
SHELBY: I 'm looking through the files but
ANDREW: Call the messenger service , have someone standing by u > Your phone .
SHELBY: Sure .
ANDREW: Think . You brought the discs in , you transferred Rachel comes into his office .
RACHEL: I thought I was supposed to be covering for you . God , Andy , you look awful .
ANDREW: Fucking Word Processing lost my Kronos complaint . Which must be filed by fucking five o'clock ! If it 's late , there 's no case Every problem has a solution .
RACHEL: What can I do ?
ANDREW: Get down to Word Processing . Help Jamey look . She rushes out .
SEIDMAN: C'mon , Andy , you did n't lose anything
ANDREW: I do n't know what to do , Bob .
SEIDMAN: You 'll never find it in the dark .
ANDREW: Bob
SEIDMAN: What 's wrong with your face ?
ANDREW: What 's wrong with my face ? You want to know what 's wrong with my face ? I 've got a skin condition . Next question , Bob ? No more questions ? Fine . Now can you help me find the complaint ?
SEIDMAN: Allright . Calm down .
ANDREW: Sorry Seidman sits in front of Andy 's computer .
SEIDMAN: What was the file name ?
ANDREW: K-R-O-one .
SEIDMAN: Maybe you mistyped the name when you were saving it . We 'll try combinations of those letters
ANDREW: You 're right , I probably just misfiled
DOCTOR: There she is , okay . You can relax now , Lisa .
JOE: Oh my god a girl oh my god Lisa oh my god He 's frantic .
LISA: Give me the camera , Joe .
JOE: Thanks , hon . Oh my god
MRS. FINLEY: Right .
JOE: Why did n't you cross at the crosswalk ?
MRS. FINLEY: Why should I ?
IRIS: Mr. Beckett ?
ANDREW: Thank you .
JOE: Explain this to me like I 'm a six year old , okay ? The entire street is clear except for one small area under construction , with a huge hole that is clearly marked and blocked off , and you decide you must cross the street at this spot . You fall into the hole and you want to sue the city for negligence ?
MRS. FINLEY: Yeah . Do I have a case ?
JOE: Of course you have a case ! Now , I want you to go with my assistant , Iris , and fill out some forms . She 'll tell you about our fee arrangement . Mrs. Finley ? Any back pain since the accident ? Dizziness ? Nightmares ?
MRS. FINLEY: Now that you mention it
JOE: Tell Iris all about it . Take good care of Mrs. Finley , Iris . Beckett , come in .
ANDREW: I have AIDS .
JOE: Whoa-oh ! Sorry , I
ANDREW: It 's okay . Can I sit down ?
JOE: Uh , yeah . Andrew hesitates . Joe does n't sound sure .
ANDREW: New baby ?
JOE: One week old .
ANDREW: Congratulations .
JOE: Little baby girl .
ANDREW: Kids are great .
JOE: Thanks , Beckett . I 'm real excited about it . What can I do for you ?
ANDREW: I was fired by Wyant Wheeler . I plan to bring a wrongful termination suit against Charles Wheeler and his partners .
JOE: You want to sue Wyant Wheele Hellerman Tetlow and Brown ?
ANDREW: Correct . I 'm seeking epresentation .
JOE: Continue .
ANDREW: I misplaced an important complaint . That 's their story . Want to hear mine ?
JOE: How many lawyers did you go to , efore you called me ?
ANDREW: Nine .
JOE: Continue .
ANDREW: I was diagnosed with AIDS eight months ago . During a bout of pneumonia . I recovered quickly and was back at work in ten days . Since I was doing so well on the AZT , we decided against telling anyone about it .
JOE: We ?
ANDREW: My lover and I .
JOE: Your lover ?
ANDREW: Miguel Alvarez . We 've lived together for nine years .
JOE: Continue .
ANDREW: I dove back into work , everything was fine . Until the lesions started
JOE: Hell , they are staring . What 's that shit on your face ?
ANDREW: Makeup .
WHEELER: Sit down , Andy . Wheeler 's secretary , LYDIA , takes notes .
ANDREW: Of course . Bob Seidman CAN NOT look directly at Andrew .
WHEELER: Andy . Before we begin , I 'd just like to say everyone in this oom is your friend .
JOE: You 're in trouble .
ANDREW: I know that , Charles .
WHEELER: More than your friend . Family .
JOE: Big trouble .
ANDREW: Charles , I must apologize again , for the Kronos mishap . It was a scary few minutes around here . Wow . But thank God , the complaint was found . And no damage was done .
KENTON: This time . What about next time ?
ANDREW: There wo n't be a next time , I guarantee it .
WHEELER: Andy . It seems that something has come over you , lately A kind of stupor , a fogginess , a lack of focus Earth to Andy . Anybody home ?
KENTON: Helloooo
KILLCOYNE: That 's right , Andy . The last four , five months you 've seemed eally out of it
SEIDMAN: At least different , somehow .
ANDREW: Perhaps you 're right . I 've certainly been busy . With the Kronos complaint , a preliminary injunction hearing and the Saunders trial all falling at the same time
KENTON: Some people think you have an attitude problem , Beckett .
ANDREW: Really ? Who thinks that , sir ?
WHEELER: I do . Wheeler seems very grave .
ANDREW: I had no idea there was a concern in that area . Hey I 'll get to work on it right away . NO ONE else smiles .
WHEELER: We 've been talking it over , Andy . Your future that is We feel that , ecause we respect you so much , we have to be honest with you .
ANDREW: Honesty is always best .
SEIDMAN: Do you really think so , Andy ?
ANDREW: Yes , Bob , I do . Excuse me ? Am I being fired ?
WHEELER: Let 's put it this way , Andy your place in the future of this firm is no longer secure .
JOE: In a word , yes .
WHEELER: We do n't think it 's fair to keep you here , where your future is limited . But we wish you luck , Andy , all the luck in the world . Wheeler rises , wearing a friendly smile .
JOE: But he 's got lots of othe people 's lives to ruin
WHEELER: we 've got a committee meeting .
ANDREW: Excuse me , Charles . With all due respect this is preposterous ! It does n't make any sense , it sounds as if we 're talking about someone else . Pardon the lack of humility , but I 've had the distinct impression I was kind of one of the ising stars around here . And I feel that was n't just my imagination . And I also think I deserve to know what 's really going on here , Charles .
KENTON: Oh , you 're right , Beckett , you do n't have an attitude problem .
WHEELER: Take it easy , Walter .
ANDREW: If you 'd lost confidence in me , why did you give me the Kronos suit ?
WHEELER: I hoped the challenge would improve your performance . You could say it was a carrot .
ANDREW: A carrot ? !
JOE: I buy that .
ANDREW: As in , the vegetable ?
SEIDMAN: Andy , you nearly blew the case , for God 's sake ! That alone is inexcusable . It would have been catastrophic for us . Put yourself in our shoes , Andy . There 's no coming back from an error like that , regardless of who you are ! I 'm sorry , Andy .
ANDREW: Uh huh Okay I see
WHEELER: Good luck , Andy .
ANDREW: Who are you ?
SECURITY GUARD: I 'm here to escort you to you office so you can organize you elongings .
JOE: Okay . Explain to me like I 'm a two year old , because there 's an element to this I ca n't get through my thick head Did n't you have an obligation to inform your employer you had this dreaded , deadly , infectious disease ?
ANDREW: The law says people with disabilities can not be terminated , so long as they can perform the duties required by their position
JOE: Okay , okay They discover you have this horrible , disgusting , terminal illness , and they panic , for any number of perfectly valid reasons . They 're frightened fo themselves , their families Maybe it 's the homo angle . Maybe they do n't want to ru elbows with someone who 's just popped out of the closet with a terminal case of acne . And how do they explain your status to the client for Chrissake ?
ANDREW: Joe , from the day I arrived to the day they fired me , I performed consistently , thoroughly and with absolute excellence . And if they had n't fired me , that 's what I 'd be doing today .
JOE: Okay They want you out . It 's against the law to fire you fo having AIDS , so they make you look like a fuck up . Which leads us to the mysterious , lost file .
ANDREW: They sabotaged me .
JOE: I knew you were going to say that . I do n't buy it , and I do n't see a case .
ANDREW: Look . I know I have a case . If you do n't want to take it fo personal reasons
JOE: Correct . I do n't . Andrew rises , thoroughly business-like .
ANDREW: Thanks for your time .
JOE: Beckett ? I 'm sorry about what 's happened to you . It 's a fucking kick in the head .
ANDREW: Do n't send flowers , Joe . I 'm not dead yet . Andrew exits .
IRIS: Have a nice day .
JOE: Find out if Armbruster can see me this afternoon .
FILKO: What the hell 's wrong with him ?
JOE: I 'm not worried . What are you doing ?
DR. ARMBRUSTER: Checking your blood pressure , elax .
JOE: I did n't have contact . What do you consider `` contact ? '' We were sitting in the same room , three , fou feet What if you shake hands ? Wait . I know the answer . Only sex , or sharing needles . I know that. < /u We did n't shake hands , anyway .
DR. ARMBRUSTER: The HIV virus can only be transmitted through the exchange of bodily fluids , namely blood and semen .
JOE: Right . Joe begins rolling down his sleeve .
DR. ARMBRUSTER: Leave that .
JOE: Yeah , but Doc , is n't it true they keep finding out new things about this disease ? So you tell me , today , there 's no danger , and I go home , and I hold my baby , and six months from now I hear on the news `` whoops ! We were wrong . ' You can carry it on your clothes , your skin , and now I 've got to worry about my kid . What are you doing ? Dr. Armbruster has been preparing a syringe .
DR. ARMBRUSTER: We 're going to draw blood .
JOE: Why are we going to do that ?
DR. ARMBRUSTER: Joe . I do n't care a whit about you private life .
JOE: You want to give me an AIDS test ? ! Joe HOPS off the table .
DR. ARMBRUSTER: Right .
JOE: It does n't travel through the air , by breathing , or touching , ight ?
DR. ARMBRUSTER: Not by touching , or shaking hands , or hugging , using the same toilet Even kissing someone with AIDS is safe . But it there 's something in your past you 're worried about
JOE: Thanks , Doc , but I do n't need an AIDS test . Are you crazy ? But thanks for the information . Really .
ARMBRUSTER: IV drug use . Joe shakes his head .
JOE: Get real .
DR. ARMBRUSTER: Unprotected sex with a prostitute .
JOE: Uh . No . Not really .
DR. ARMBRUSTER: Or unprotected sex with someone you did n't know very well , any time during the last twelve years .
JOE: Not especially .
LISA: How many gays do you know ?
JOE: How many do you know ?
LISA: Lots .
JOE: Who ?
LISA: Karen Berman . Aunt Teresa . My cousin Tommy who lives in Rochester . Eddie Meyers from the office . Joe Cantwell , he 's one of the partners . His lover , Greg . Stanley , the guy who 's putting in our kitchen cabinets .
JOE: Your Aunt Teresa is gay ? That eautiful , sensuous woman is a u > lesbian ?
LISA: Duh
JOE: Since when ?
LISA: Probably since she was born .
JOE: Allright . I admit it I 'm prejudiced . I do n't want to work with a homosexual . You got me .
LISA: Okay , Joe
JOE: I mean , two guys , doing the horizontal thing ? I do n't get it . Do n't they get confused ? `` Is that mine ? I thought it was yours . '' Hey , call me old fashioned , call me conservative I think maybe you have to be a man to get just how nauseating the whole basic idea really is .
LISA: Fine , Joe .
JOE: And the way they work out , pumping up , so they can be macho and faggot at the same time I ca n't stand that shit . Now I 'm eing totally honest with you .
LISA: That 's perfectly clear .
JOE: Would you take a client if you were constantly thinking `` I hope this guy does n't touch me . I do n't even want him to breathe < /u on me ? ''
LIBRARIAN: This is the supplement . You 're ight , there is a section on HIV related discrimination .
ANDREW: Thank you .
LIBRARIAN: We have a private research room available .
ANDREW: I 'm fine , thanks .
LIBRARIAN: Would n't you be more comfortable in a research room ?
ANDREW: No . But would it make you more comfortable ?
LIBRARIAN: Whatever , sir .
JOE: Oh , Beckett . How 's it goin ' ?
ANDREW: Fine . Andrew goes back to his work .
JOE: Who 'd you get ?
ANDREW: What ?
JOE: Find a lawyer ?
ANDREW: I 'm a lawyer . How 's your baby ?
JOE: Huh ? Oh . Great . She 's great .
ANDREW: What 's her name ?
JOE: Rayisha .
ANDREW: Rayisha . Very nice . Andrew focuses on his work . Joe steps away . Joe comes back .
JOE: How did they find out ?
ANDREW: One of the partners spotted a lesion on my forehead .
JOE: Uh huh Andrew concentrates on his work once more .
ANDREW: Good point .
JOE: They did n't fire her ?
ANDREW: No . They did n't fire her .
JOE: So Kenton connected the lesion , u > and whatever suspicions he had about your personal life to this woman , Maria and blew the whistle on you . Suddenly you 're losing files , and it 's time to let you go . But , up to this point , you 've been their Golden Boy , their rising star Thei ehavior is inconsistent .
ANDREW: Thank you . Andrew goes back to work .
JOE: There is no relevant precedent .
ANDREW: Arline decision . Supreme Court .
JOE: Arline ? Andrew SHOVES the legal book toward Joe .
WHEELER: Julius !
KENTON: Dr. J. !
LAWYERS: How 's it goin ' , Doctor ? /This is an honor ! /etc
JOE: Excuse me . Charles Wheeler ?
WHEELER: interview every employee , support staff , associates , partners . Did any of them know Andy was sick ? u > How did they know ? Did he tell them ? Did they notice something was wrong with his appearance ? None of this information got to the managing partners . We know that . Make sure everyone else does too And Beckett I want to know everything about his personal life . Did he frequent those pathetic bars on Camac Street ?
SEIDMAN: Jesus .
WHEELER: What about other homosexual facilities , whatever they are ?
SEIDMAN: Charles
WHEELER: What deviant groups o organizations did he secretly elong to ? What is it , Bob ? !
SEIDMAN: Let 's settle with Andy and put this whole tragic mess behind us .
WHEELER: Andrew brought AIDS into ou offices , into our men 's room . He brought AIDS to our annual goddamn family picnic .
KENTON: We ought to be suing him .
SEIDMAN: For Christ 's sake , where 's you compassion ?
KENTON: Compassion ? Andy sucks cocks , Bob . He takes it up the ass . He 's a pervert . Only Seidman shows any kind of REACTION .
SEIDMAN: That 's kind of extreme , Walt . Andy 's private life is none of our business .
WHEELER: Bob . You 're trying my patience . Andrew Beckett is making his private life our business . We gave him Kronos . Did he say , `` I 'm sick . I might not be able to see this through ? ''
SEIDMAN: He was doing a great job .
WHEELER: Bob . I must ask you to shut the fuck up . Did Andrew Beckett say `` I might not be able to serve ou clients to the best of my ability ? '' He said nothing . And now , Andrew Beckett proposes to haul me into a court of law , to sling accusations at me , in full view of the entire , Philadelphia , judicial establishment . My God .
KILLCOYNE: Beckett does n't want to go to court , he 's hoping for a quick tasty settlement .
SEIDMAN: A jury might decide that Andy has a case .
WHEELER: Wait a minute . The man was fired fo incompetence , not because he has AIDS . You did n't know he was sick , did you , Bob ?
KENTON: Holy Shit . Did you , Bob ?
SEIDMAN: No . Not really .
FILKO: Charles Fucking Wyant Wheeler ? ! Joe sweeps by , just arriving for work .
JOE: Morning , Filko .
COLLEAGUE: Hey , it 's the local chapter of the ACLU !
FILKO: You 're a Republican , Joe ! You elong to the NRA !
JOE: How many toilet stalls are there in the women 's restroom on this floor , Filko ?
FILKO: How many what ? ! Filko follows Joe into Joe 's office .
JOE: Two . How many toilet stalls are there in the men 's room ? Two , u > plus four urinals . How many wheelchair accessible toilets in u > either of those restrooms ? Zero . In this entire building ? Zero . Get the picture , Filko ? u > Discrimination ! You find yourself a female , paraplegic , legal assistant who is qualified to work here , except she ca n't take a leak and you 've got yourself a sex discrimination suit and a handicapped discrimination suit . Not handicapped . What do you call someone who ca n't use a normal estroom ? `` Gastro-intestinally challenged ! ''
IRIS: Wyant Wheeler 's asking for a postponement on the prelim , Joe . Joe is dialing the phone .
JOE: Low-life , sleazy scumbags . Of course they want a postponement , I 've got a client with a terminal disease . They 're going to drag their heels every step of the way , the rotten bastards . ( tapping on the window , to the
WOMAN'S VOICE: I can heal myself .
ANDREW: I can heal myself .
WOMAN'S VOICE: I can heal myself .
ANDREW: I can heal myself .
MIGUEL: I was coming out of the gym today , and I ran into Jimmy . Do you know what he asked me ? `` What 's it like knowing you oyfriend 's going to die ? ''
ANDREW: Jerk What did you say ?
MIGUEL: I said , `` Everyone 's going to die , Jimmy . But Drew 's not going to die of AIDS . There 's a cure around the corner , and he plans to be around to take advantage of it . '' Miguel strokes Andrew 's hair .
ANDREW: You got that right , Mikey You still believe that , do n't you ?
MIGUEL: Yes . I think it will be a simple solution . They 'll put it in a syringe , inject it into your bloodstream . It 'll neutralize the virus . It 'll evitalize the immune system , and people with AIDS will become healthy again .
WHEELER: You 're looking better , Andy . How do you feel ?
ANDREW: Fine , thanks , Charles .
JUDGE GARNETT: Charles , Walter
WHEELER: Congratulations on the new grandson .
JUDGE GARNETT: Thank you . We 're very happy .
JOE: Joseph Miller , Your Honor . Macready and Shilts Legal Services .
JUDGE GARNETT: I 've seen your television commercials . `` If you or anyone you know has een injured through the fault of others It should say , `` through the negligence of others . ''
JOE: I 'll take that under consideration , Your Honor .
JUDGE GARNETT: On behalf of the defendants ?
BELINDA CONINE: Belinda Conine . Of Petersen , Lehigh , Monroe and Smith .
JEROME GREEN: And Jerome Green . And a WASPISH lawyer wearing round glasses
RALPH PETERSEN: Ralph Petersen .
JUDGE GARNETT: You 're outnumbered four to one . Whom do I address ? I ca n't talk to four lawyers at once .
BELINDA: I 'm chief litigator , Your Honor .
JUDGE GARNETT: Fine . I 've asked the litigants to be present for this conference , in the hope we can settle this matte today , among ourselves There is nothing I hate more , than to see lawyers suing each other . If you look at the opinion polls , when Mr. John Q . Citizen is asked to rank professions according to the espect he holds for them Where are the lawyers ? Somewhere below personal fitness trainers and only slightly above child pornographers . If we keep suing each other , if we fail to settle the smallest difference among ourselves with mutual respect , if we continue to scrap like bucks in heat , we 'll fall lower on that list . And when people lose respect for lawyers , they lose respect for the law . And when this society loses all respect for the law , we 'll be murdered in our beds , my friends , our cherished institutions will be burned to the ground and our children and ou grandchildren will live like savages .
JOE: If it please Your Honor , we hope to settle this matter .
JUDGE GARNETT: By God you will settle it ! If you force this case to trial , young man , you 'll regret it for the rest of your natural-born days Now , Joseph . What would you equire to settle this matte today ?
JOE: Reinstatement at full salary . Back pay covering the period of unemployment and
JUDGE GARNETT: Hold it , Joe . He wants to come back to work , Chuck .
WHEELER: That 's impossible , Your Honor .
JUDGE GARNETT: That 's impossible , Joe .
BELINDA CONINE: If it please Your Honor , we 're prepared to offer a cash settlement of twenty-five thousand dollars .
JOE: Your generosity overwhelms me , Belinda , considering my client was earning over a hundred thou when he was terminated almost six months ago .
JUDGE GARNETT: Give me a break , Joe . Let 's cut through these false attitudes . Give them a figure . How much do you want ?
ANDREW: I want to go back to work , You Honor .
JUDGE GARNETT: You 're here at my indulgence , young man . I 'm waiting for a figure , Joe . Andrew and Joe confer with each other .
JOE: Based on what my client would have earned over the next three years , including benefits and projected raises , and the extraordinary cost of medical care for someone with Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome We would settle today for the very fair amount of one million five hundred thousand dollars .
JUDGE GARNETT: Very good , Joe . Now , Belinda , I 've got a figure over here , of one million , five . I
JOE: One more thing , Your Honor
ANDREW: Any settlement agreement must < /u include , and this is critical , a letter of exoneration , making clear my termination had nothing to do with the quality of my work . Charles Wheeler WHISPERS to Belinda Conine .
BELINDA CONINE: Your Honor , Mr. Beckett 's incompetence nearly sabotaged a 350 million dollar suit .
ANDREW: I was the one who was sabotaged .
BELINDA CONINE: We have complaints about Mr. Beckett 's lack of preparation , his disorganization , his arrogant , defensive attitude The list goes on .
JEROME GREEN: We have letters .
JOE: Why have n't you produced these letters ?
JUDGE GARNETT: Take it easy . What 's the big deal , Chuck ? The oy wants a letter , to show to his mother , for her to keep afte he 's gone . Why are you being hard- assed about this ?
WHEELER: I wish I could exonerate you , Andy . But I 'd have to lie to do it .
ANDREW: You can save it for the jury , Charles . I want to hear you say , under oath , in front of a judge and a jury , I 'm a bad lawyer . Gentlemen . Counselor .
WHEELER: Do n't do this , Andy .
JOE: Whoa , whoa What do you expect them to say , you 're Alan Dershowitz ?
KENTON: A trial takes time , Beckett . Do you know what I 'm saying ?
ANDREW: I think I catch your subtle drift , Walter . Andrew saunters out .
KENTON: You 'll be sorry , Beckett .
WHEELER: Andy , you do n't want this .
JOE: With all due respect , Your Honor , my client chooses to pursue his constitutionally guaranteed ight to a trial . Joe exits .
ANDREW: This is the house where I grew up . In Downington , Pennsylvania . See this ?
MIGUEL'S VOICE: And today is ?
ANDREW: Today is my parents ' fortieth wedding anniversary . Andrew goes inside , speaking to the CAMERA
ALEXIS: Uncle Andrew !
ANDREW: This is my niece , Alexis . Say hello , Alexis .
ALEXIS: Mommy 's pregnant again .

JILL: You feel thin . Hello , Miguel .
MIGUEL: Hey , Jill . Nice to see you , sweetheart .
JILL: Handsome devil . Is he eating ?
MIGUEL: We do n't discuss his weight . Do we ?
LADIES: There he is ! Hi , Andrew ! Do n't point that thing at me ! etc
ANDREW: Hi , Mom . How do you feel on you fortieth anniversary ?
SARAH: Ancient . How do you think I feel ? Put that thing down and give me a hug . Andrew , stop ! He still does n't listen .
ANDREW: Where 's Dad ?
SARAH: He 's out in his shed showing you uncle his new riding mower .
ANDREW: Things might be said , at the trial , that are not going to e easy for you to hear . Things about me , about my private life . And I want to make sure it 's okay with everybody .
MATT: I appreciate you asking , Andy , ut really , it 's your call .
ANDREW: What do you think , Jill ?
JILL: To be honest , I 'm worried about Mommy and Daddy . They 've had to go through so much already And , we all know There 's going to be even worse things to deal with , eventually . I wonder if it 's fair to put them through this . Andrew 's father STARES at his folded hands .
ANDREW: Mom ?
SARAH: All I know is , you got through your diagnosis fine , like a trooper . But when they fired you you were so devastated , Andy I do n't expect any of my kids to sit in the back of the bus . Fight for your rights .
ANDREW: Thanks , Mom Dad ? There 's a pause before Bud Beckett speaks .
BUD: Supposedly , the Lord does n't give you more trouble than you can handle . But I 'm having a hard time believing that these days .
ANDREW: Thanks , Dad . I love you guys . How about you , Randy ?
RANDY: Hey . You 're my kid brother , Andy . That 's the bottom line . I mean , what are those bastards going to say ? You 're gay ? Shit , I knew that when you were five years old . Everyone LAUGHS . Andrew and Randy high five .
MIGUEL: Wait a minute You 're gay ? More laughter . But Jill speaks seriously
JILL: What about you , Andy ? You 're not a militant type . You 've always een so private .
ANDREW: I guess I do n't have time fo that any more .
SARAH: Jim ? Will you lead us in a prayer ?
REVEREND JIM: Dear Lord . Sometimes it is difficult to remember to be grateful
EVERYONE: Amen .
GUIDO: `` After all the days of Spring have flown ''
MIGUEL: Yes . I can .
BELINDA: Fact . Andrew Beckett performed at a consistently mediocre level . Fact . He made a grievous error on a multi-million dolla lawsuit Fact . He claims he is the victim of lies and deceit . Fact . Andrew Beckett lied to his employers , going to great efforts to conceal his disease from them . Fact . He was successful in his duplicity . The partners at Wyant Wheeler did not know Andrew Beckett had AIDS when they fired him
JOE: Andrew Beckett represented you company in a lawsuit in 1990 , is that correct ?
LAIRD: Wyant Wheeler represented us .
JOE: But , Andrew Beckett was in charge of litigation for the suit .
LAIRD: That 's correct .
JOE: Were you pleased with his work ?
LAIRD: We were satisfied .
JOE: Were you satisfied , or were you pleased ?
LAIRD: We were satisfied . Joe refers to legal documents .
JOE: Mr. Laird , when I approached you about being a witness at this trial , and you agreed , you gave sworn testimony in a deposition . Is that correct ?
LAIRD: That 's correct .
JOE: According to the deposition , you said you were `` thrilled , impressed , overwhelmed '' by the quality of Andrew Beckett 's work . Do you emember saying that ?
LAIRD: I may have said something like that . But that 's not how I feel at this moment . Joe takes on a street-tough tone
JOE: Okay , Mr. Laird . Explain this to me like I 'm a four year old Did Andrew Beckett win your lawsuit for you or not ?
LAIRD: We won .
JOE: Did that thrill , impress and overwhelm you ?
LAIRD: It satisfied me . Joe STARES at the guy .
JOE: It 's a long way between being overwhelmed and being satisfied . A cheeseburger may be satisfying whereas caviar and champagne and oast duck and baked Alaska fo dessert might be considered overwhelming . Do you agree ?
LAIRD: I might .
JOE: Five months ago you characterized Andrew Beckett as caviar and now you 're calling him a cheeseburger . Your standards have shifted a great deal , and I 'd like to know why you 've changed your mind .
LAIRD: Since that time I 've devoted more thought to the subject , and that 's how I feel now .
JEROME GREEN: Partner Robert Seidman was the supervising attorney for you lawsuit ?
MR. LAIRD: That 's right .
JEROME GREEN: Does the supervising attorney guide the litigating attorney during the trial ?
MR. LAIRD: Often , he does .
JEROME GREEN: As far as you know , in the handling of your lawsuit , Andrew Beckett was simply following orders .
LAIRD: That 's a fair assessment of the situation .
ANDREW: I 'm not political . I just want compensation for being fired .
REPORTER MEDINA: But you are gay , are n't you ?
ANDREW: `` I do n't see how that 's any of your business But yes , I am . ''
REPORTER MEDINA: `` Do you believe that homosexuals deserve special treatment ? ''
FILKO: Hell , no ! JOE `` Angela , we 're standing in Philadelphia , the City of Brotherly Love , the birthplace of freedom , where our Founding Fathers authored the Declaration of Independence . And I do n't emember that glorious document saying `` All straight men are created equal . '' I could have sworn it says , `` All men are created equal . ''
REPORTER MEDINA: `` This case is sending a cold chill through the legal community . One of Wyant Wheeler 's key clients , the Grace Foster Foundation , which supports several AIDS charities , has taken its business to anothe firm until this matter is esolved ''
FILKO: Hey , Joe . You 're not starting to get a little light on your feet here on us , are you ? Joe does not laugh .
JOE: Yeah , Filko . I am . I 'm on the prowl , Filko . I need a man . Not just any man . I need a hunk . A hunk like you . How about it , Filko ? Want to play sailor ? This time , I 'll be first mate and you can be Columbus .
FILKO: Chill out , Joe .
JOE: Those people make me sick , Filko ! But a law 's been oken , okay ? The law . Remembe the law ? CHARLIE THE COP has relaxed a bit .
SARAH: `` This is a world full of war , famine , poverty , homelessness and people make a fuss because two men or two women want to live together , or make love . Seems kind of silly , does n't it ? ''
JOE: And Walter Kenton knew the lesions on your face and arms were caused by AIDS ?
MARIA: Definitely . People were going around , whispering things . I figured I did n't have anything to lose , so I told all the partners .
JOE: How did Walter Kenton treat you , after you told him you had AIDS ? CLOSE ON KENTON , looking confident .
MARIA: Every time he came into contact with me , he 'd get this look on his face . I called it , the `` Oh God '' expression . As in `` Oh God , here comes that woman with
JOE: Ms. Torres ? Have your employers fired you for having AIDS ?
MARIA: No . When I need time off , fo medical reasons , we work it out .
JOE: Thank you . No more questions . Jerome Green rises .
JEROME GREEN: Miss Torres . How did you contract the AIDS virus ?
MARIA: During a transfusion . I lost a lot of blood giving birth to my second child .
JEROME GREEN: In other words , in your case you happen to be an innocent victim of the AIDS tragedy .
MARIA: Look . I 'm no different from everyone else who has this disease I 'm not guilty , I 'm not innocent . I 'm just trying to survive .
JOE: Beyond noticing the marks on his face , were there othe things about his appearance that made you suspect he had
ANTHEA: He was losing weight . He looked kind of tired sometimes . But he was working so hard Still , I felt something was wrong . And I ca n't believe they 're < /u saying they did n't notice anything .
BELINDA: Objection .
JUDGE GARNETT: Just answer the question .
ANTHEA: Sorry .
JOE: Ms. Burton . You 're black .
ANTHEA: Is that a question ?
JOE: No . Have you ever felt discriminated against , at Wyant Wheeler ?
ANTHEA: Yes .
JOE: In what way ?
ANTHEA: Well One time , Mr. Wheeler 's secretary , Lydia , told me Mr. Wheeler had a problem with my earrings .
JOE: Your earrings ?
ANTHEA: Apparently , Mr. Wheeler felt they were too `` ethnic '' is the word she used . She said he would like it if I wore something smaller , less garish , and more `` American . ''
JOE: What did you say ?
ANTHEA: I said my earrings are American . They 're African-American .
JOE: Thank you . No more questions . Belinda Conine approaches Anthea .
BELINDA: Miss Burton ? Do you still work at Wyant Wheeler ?
ANTHEA: Yes .
BELINDA: Were you recently promoted ?
ANTHEA: Yes . I 'm now in charge of the paralegal department .
BELINDA: Thank you .
YOUNG MAN: How 's the trial going ? It 's a great case . Joe looks up surprised . The YOUNG MAN smiles .
JOE: Good school . What year ?
YOUNG MAN: Second .
JOE: Great .
YOUNG MAN: Would you like to have a drink with me ? I just finished a game , I could use a beer . I do n't pick up people in drug stores every day .
JOE: Whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa do you think ? You think I 'm gay ?
YOUNG MAN: Are n't you ?
JOE: What 's the matter with you ? Do I look gay to you ?
YOUNG MAN: Do I look gay to you ? Relax .
JOE: Relax ? I ought to kick you faggoty little ass for you !
YOUNG MAN: Take it as a compliment . Geesh . But Joe is really upset . People are watching .
JOE: Do n't you know this is exactly the kind of bullshit that makes people hate you guys ?
YOUNG MAN: Fuck you ! You want to kick my ass ? You want to try ? Asshole .
JOE: You 're the asshole , buddy .
YOUNG MAN: Get a life .
JOE: But what was it ? ! What was this guy thinking ? !
LISA: Do n't know , Joe .
JOE: Is there some kind of expression I 've picked up from Beckett ? ! Some kind of fairy attitude I 've unconsciously adopted ? ! Am I walking different ? ! Some kind of vocal thing ? ! Have I picked up some kind of homo vibe ? !
LISA: Have you changed your aftershave ?
JOE: Very funny . I had a box of Pampers under my arm fo Chrissake !
LISA: Joe ?
JOE: Yeah ?
LISA: Two men making love ? Now tell me again why is that disgusting ?
JOE: Lisa , c'mon . One guy sticking his dick in another guy 's mouth ? It 's disgusting . They lie in silence for a moment . Then
LISA: Okay , so help me with this one , Joe Is it disgusting fo someone to put his dick into someone 's mouth ? Or , is it disgusting for someone to take a dick into their mouth ?
JOE: Great , Lisa . Thank you .
JAMEY: Yes . We found a copy . It been incorrectly filed TITLE `` Plaintiff 's case , day ten . ''
JOE: Has a file ever disappeared like that before ? Vanished into thin air , all of a sudden , only to eappear in the nick of time ? Jamey answers nervously
JAMEY: I 've never known that to happen efore . No .
JOE: Did you have something to do with this file being lost accidentally-on-purpose ?
BELINDA: Objection !
JOE: I 'll rephrase . Did you have anything to do with this file being misplaced ?
JAMEY: Absolutely not .
JOE: Are you a homosexual ?
JAMEY: What ? ! Joe pressing forward , toward Jamey .
JOE: C'mon , Mr. Collins . Are you homosexual ? You know , gay ?
JUDGE GARNETT: Hold it , hold it ! Andrew trains his attention on Joe .
BELINDA: Objection ! Where has this come from ? ! Suddenly Counsel is attacking his own witness . Mr. Collins ' sexual orientation has absolutely no relevance to this case .
JUDGE GARNETT: I said , HOLD IT ! Mr. Miller . Could you kindly share with me exactly what 's going on in your brain , because I do n't have a clue at the moment .
JOE: Your Honor , everyone in this courtroom is thinking about sexual preference , sexual orientation , whatever you want to call it . They 're looking at me , and wondering about it They 're looking at Mr. Beckett , and wondering about it . They 're looking at Mr. Wheeler and wondering about it . They might even be looking at you and wondering about it . So , let 's get it out in the open . Let 's talk about what this case is really about the general public 's hatred our loathing , our fear of homosexuals . DEAD SILENCE while the Judge thinks it over .
ANDREW: Very good .
JUDGE GARNETT: In this courtroom , Mr. Miller , justice is blind . To matters of ace , creed , color , religion . And sexual orientation .
JOE: With all due respect , Your Honor We do n't live in this courtroom , do we ?
JUDGE GARNETT: No . We do n't However , as egards this witness , I 'm going to sustain the defense 's objection .
MARINE: No , sir . I do not .
JOE: And how many weeks at a time would you be out to sea , without stopping at port ?
KENTON: Anywhere from two weeks , to several months .
JOE: Any women on board ? Kenton glances at the MARINE JUROR .
KENTON: Not when I was in the Navy .
JOE: So during those long voyages , months at a time , out to sea , no women in sight , a hundred , hardworking , robust , young men , in the prime of their life , at the peak of their natural appetites , desires , their god- given , hormonal instincts Anything going on ?
KENTON: Going on like ?
JOE: Like two sailors playing hide the salami . Andrew covers his face with his hands .
BELINDA: Objection !
JUDGE GARNETT: Mr. Miller !
KENTON: We had one guy like that .
BELINDA: You have n't ruled on my objection , Your Honor .
JUDGE GARNETT: Let 's continue .
JOE: You had one guy `` like that ? ''
KENTON: Yeah . But we took care of him .
JOE: How did you do that ?
KENTON: We stuck his head in the latrine , after ten of us had used it .
JOE: You taught him a lesson .
KENTON: Yes , we did .
JOE: Like firing Andrew Beckett taught him a lesson ?
BELINDA: Objection !
JOE: I 'll withdraw . You were aware , when you worked with Maria Torres , that she had AIDS , correct ?
KENTON: She did n't try to conceal it .
JOE: So you are aware of the difference between a lesion and a bruise , is that correct ?
KENTON: I know the difference . That does n't mean I 'm always able to ecognize the difference .
JOE: But did n't you avoid contact with Ms. Torres , after you found out she had AIDS ? She says you acted repulsed by her and you avoided her , is that correct ?
KENTON: I felt , and still feel , nothing ut the deepest sympathy and compassion for people like Maria , who have contracted this terrible disease through no fault of their own .
MIGUEL: Drew ! Are you ready ? If we start at eight , we 'll be done by twelve .
ANDREW: We 'll have to flush it again . Andrew reaches for a law book .
MIGUEL: Hold still . Shit . The goddamn vein 's clotted . We have to go the goddamn hospital , so they can change the goddamn catheter .
ANDREW: I have too much work to do . Skip the treatment .
MIGUEL: We 're not skipping this treatment .
ANDREW: I said , skip it , Michael . It 's my treatment .
MIGUEL: Fuck you .
ANDREW: Fuck you . This shit 's probably not doing me any good anyway .
MIGUEL: That shit 's saving your life , you asshole ! Miguel shoves away from the table .
ANDREW: What 's wrong with you ?
MIGUEL: Close the law book .
ANDREW: I 'm not going to close the
ANDREW: ALLRIGHT IT 'S CLOSED ! Jesus !
MIGUEL: The least you can do is look at me , while I 'm sticking this shit into your arm . Forget the fucking case , one hour a day , and give me a little of you time .
ANDREW: You do n't think there 's much time left , do you ?
MIGUEL: That 's not what I said .
ANDREW: You 're scared . You think we 're near the end .
MIGUEL: No .
ANDREW: Maybe I should start making plans , is that what you think ? Start planning my memorial service ? `` Begin to prepare for the inevitable . ''
MIGUEL: Maybe you should think about it .
ANDREW: What 's that mean ? !
MIGUEL: Maybe you should think about it .
ANDREW: I 'm not going to die .
MIGUEL: That 's right . We 're on the Positive Plan . You do n't have a Fatal Disease , you have Manageable Illness .
ANDREW: You want me to give up ? Let this thing turn us into victims ?
MIGUEL: Then , what are we , Drew ? ! The u > winners ? `` Ladies and gentlemen , the first prize of AIDS goes to Andrew Beckett and his love Miguel '' Excuse me , I 'm not your lover . I 'm your Care Partner .
ANDREW: I 'm not ready to die .
MIGUEL: Do you think I 'm ready for it ? ! I hate this shit . I 'm not a fucking martyr ! I hate every goddamn part of it !
ANDREW: I am so scared . I am so fucking , incredibly , fucking scared
JOE: Did I ever tell you , I hate costume parties ?
LISA: My lettuce is wilting .
JOE: We 're friends of Beckett 's .
ANDREW: It 's me , you dork .
LISA: I 'm Lisa Miller .
ANDREW: Glad to finally meet you . Come on in .
MIGUEL: My sister , Maria . Pastrami on rye ?
LISA: Corned beef .
MIGUEL: Want to dance ?
LISA: Sure !
JOE: Beckett . You seem better . Energized , more alive
ANDREW: I had a blood transfusion today . I feel great .
JOE: I 'm a law suit .
ANDREW: Not bad .
JOE: Get it ?
ANDREW: Let 's find you a drink .
JOE: Beer . We need to go over your Q and A .
ANDREW: Excuse me , I 'm having a goddamn party , is that allright with you ?
JOE: Sure . It 's fine .
ANDREW: No , we have to do it . But later , allright ?
JOE: Thank you .
LA TOYA: 'Scuse me , darling . Andrew is SMILING at Joe .
JOE: You think I 'm uncomfortable
ANDREW: Correct .
JOE: You 're right . Joe spills beer down his shirt .
ANDREW: Thank you .
MARIE ANTOINETTE: I 'm an accountant . What do you do ?
JOE: I 'm a lawyer . That 's my wife !
SARAH: Have a cocktail wienie .
JOE: Thanks , Sarah . Nice costume .
POLICEMAN: It 's not a costume , I just got off work . You 're cute .
JOE: That 's my wife . Want to see a picture of my baby ?
POLICEMAN: Absolutely . Want to see a picture of my baby ?
JOE: I 'll see you in an hour , max .
LISA: Night , honey .
ANDREW: Congratulations , Miller .
JOE: Let me tell you something , okay ? When you 're brought up , like the est of us , in a place like where I was brought up , there 's not a whole lot of discussion about homosexuals . As a kid , you 're taught right away that queers are weird , queers are funny , they 're a danger to kids , they 're afraid to fight , and they all want to cop your joint . And that pretty much sums up the general thinking out there , if you want to know the truth .
ANDREW: Thank you for sharing that with me , Joe .
JOE: Let 's review these notes for you testimony . We have a big day on Monday .
ANDREW: Uh huh
JOE: What ?
ANDREW: Do you pray ?
JOE: Yeah . Sure . Joe goes back to the notes
ANDREW: What have you prayed for ?
JOE: For a healthy baby . For Lisa to make it through the delivery . For the Phillies to get into the playoffs .
ANDREW: There 's a possibility I wo n't be around for the end of this trial .
JOE: I 've considered that .
ANDREW: What happens ?
JOE: We proceed , representing you estate .
ANDREW: I 've made provisions in my will for some charities . Miguel will need a lawyer . I know it 's not your area
JOE: I know a good probate lawyer .
ANDREW: Thanks . Do you like opera ?
JOE: Opera ?
ANDREW: Want to hear my favorite aria ?
JOE: Opera ?
ANDREW: Andrea Chenier , by Giordano . This is Madeleine . She 's telling how , during the French evolution , a mob set fire to her house . Her mothe died , saving her . `` I look The place that cradled me was urning ! '' Do you hear the heartache in he voice ? Then , here come the strings . Everything changes . The music fills with hope . Madeleine says
JOE: I think I 'll I told Lisa .
ANDREW: Right . Andrew follows Joe to the door .
JOE: You 're ready , do n't worry .
BAILIFF: Place your left hand on the Bible and raise your right hand . Andrew places his hand on the Bible .
ANDREW: Wyant Wheeler had aggressively ecruited me . They were the most prestigious firm in Philadelphia , full of opportunity . And I was impressed by the partners .
JOE: Including Charles Wheeler ?
ANDREW: Particularly , Charles .
JOE: What impressed you about him ?
ANDREW: He was the kind of person I thought I wanted to be .
JOE: What kind of person is that ?
ANDREW: Possessed of an encyclopedic knowledge of the law . A razo sharp litigator , a genuine leader , gifted at bringing out the very best in others . An awesome ability to illuminate the most complex of legal concepts to colleagues , courtrooms , the person on the street . The kind of person who plays three sets of tennis but does n't sweat . But underneath the elegant surface , was an adventurous spirit . Belinda Conine MAKES A NOTE ABOUT THAT .
JOE: Obviously , at this time , you were n't sick .
ANDREW: It 's possible I was infected with the HIV virus at that time , but I was n't diagnosed until several years later .
JOE: You did n't look then , the way you look now ?
ANDREW: No . I was thirty pounds heavier . I was athletic .
JOE: A regular all-American guy ?
ANDREW: I suppose you could say that .
JOE: Except you were gay ?
ANDREW: I still am .
JOE: In the years you worked at Wyant Wheeler , did you ever tell Charles Wheeler you were gay ?
ANDREW: No . I did n't .
JOE: Can you explain why you did n't ?
ANDREW: You do n't bring your personal life into a law firm . You 're not supposed to have a personal life , really . Anyway , I did plan to tell Charles , eventually . But then , this thing happened at the tennis club
WHEELER: Longstreet 's interested in the Harrisburg deal .
ANDREW: I 'm seeing him this afternoon .
FIRST MAN: What do you call a woman who has PMS and ESP at the same time ? .
SECOND MAN: What ?
FIRST MAN: A bitch who knows everything .
CHARLES WHEELER: How does a faggot fake an orgasm ? Andrew opens one eye .
SEIDMAN: Charles , that 's revolting !
ANDREW: Relieved . That I 'd never told him I was gay . Very relieved .
JOE: Are you a good lawyer ?
ANDREW: I 'm an excellent lawyer .
JOE: What makes you an excellent lawyer ?
ANDREW: I love the law . I know the law . I excel at practicing it . It 's the only thing I 've ever wanted to do .
JOE: What do you love about it ?
ANDREW: Well many things . But I think the thing I love the most , is that every once in a while , not that often , but occasionally you get to be part of justice being done . It 's really quite a thrill when that happens .
BELINDA: You said earlier you aspired to e the kind of person who had `` an adventurous spirit . '' Is that correct ?
ANDREW: Something like that .
BELINDA: Do you take risks ?
ANDREW: In my work ? Yes . Calculated isks . You have to .
BELINDA: In general . Do you take risks in other areas of your life ?
ANDREW: Not unnecessary ones .
BELINDA: Have you ever been to the Apollo Cinema on Sansom Street ? Joe cringes a little with discomfort .
ANDREW: A few times .
BELINDA: Gay pornographic movies ?
ANDREW: Yes .
BELINDA: Do men have sex with each othe in that theater ?
ANDREW: Yes .
YUPPIE: I 'm Robert .
ANDREW: Andrew . Andrew steps into the booth .
ROBERT: I think we 'll figure it out .
BELINDA: When ? Approximately what year did this event take place ?
ANDREW: I guess it was 1984 , 85 .
BELINDA: Were you aware in 1984 or 1985 that there was a fatal disease out there , called AIDS , and that you could contract it through sexual activity ?
ANDREW: It 's impossible to know exactly when or how I was infected with HIV .
BELINDA: But you were having anonymous sex in porno theaters in 1984 and 1985 ?
ANDREW: That happened once . People were n't talking about AIDS then , the way we are now . Or safe sex .
BELINDA: You 'd heard of AIDS in 1984 , 85 ?
ANDREW: I 'd heard of something . The gay plague , gay cancer , but we did n't know how you could get it , or that it could kill you . CLOSE SHOT ON ANDREW losing strength .
BELINDA: While you were employed at Wyant Wheeler , you did everything you could to make sure no one knew you were an active homosexual , correct ?
ANDREW: That is not correct . I never lied about it .
BELINDA: Did you keep a picture of you lover on your desk ?
ANDREW: No .
BELINDA: Do other lawyers at the firm keep pictures of their spouses o fiances on their desks ?
ANDREW: Some do . I did n't .
BELINDA: As a homosexual , one is often forced to conceal one 's sexuality , is that right ?
ANDREW: In some situations .
BELINDA: Is n't it true you have spent you life pretending to be something you 're not , so much so that the art of concealment and dishonesty has become second nature to you ? !
JOE: Objection !
BELINDA: I 'll withdraw it . Mr. Beckett ? Were you living with Miguel Alvarez in 1984 or 1985 when you had your anonymous sexual encounte in the porn theater ? ANGLE ON MIGUEL , sitting next to Sarah .
ANDREW: Yes .
BELINDA: You could have infected him , is n't that right ?
ANDREW: Miguel has not been infected . As I said , we were n't aware of AIDS , then , or how it is spread .
BELINDA: Really ?
ANDREW: Yes . Andrew wipes sweat from his forehead .
BELINDA: You 've testified the lesions on your face were visible to the people you worked with , correct ?
ANDREW: That 's right .
BELINDA: And it 's your contention , that when the partners were made aware of the lesions , they jumped to the conclusion you had AIDS and fired you .
ANDREW: Absolutely .
BELINDA: Do you have any lesions on you face at this time ?
ANDREW: One . Here , in front of my ear .
BELINDA: Remembering you are under oath , answering truthfully , can you see the lesion on your face , in this mirror , three feet away ? Answering truthfully .
ANDREW: By the time I was fired , there were four lesions on my face , much bigger
BELINDA: Answer the question , please .
ANDREW: No . I ca n't really see it .
BELINDA: Thank you . Andrew rubs his eyes .
ANDREW: Yes sir . Joe JUMPS UP from the plaintiff 's table .
JOE: I only need five ! May I ? Joe approaches Andrew , with the mirror .
ANDREW: Yes . On my torso .
JOE: If it please the court , I 'd like to ask Mr. Beckett to emove his shirt , so that the jury can have an accurate idea of what we 're talking about .
BELINDA: We object , Your Honor . It would unfairly influence the jury .
JOE: Your Honor , if Mr. Beckett was forced by his illness to use a wheelchair , would the defense ask him to park it outside ? We 're talking about AIDS , we 're talking about lesions . Let 's u > see what we 're talking about .
JUDGE GARNETT: I 'll allow it . Would you mind emoving your shirt , Mr. Beckett ?
ANDREW: Allright . The COURTROOM TURNS SILENT .
JOE: Can you see the lesions on you chest in this mirror ?
ANDREW: Yes .
JOE: Thank you .
SEIDMAN: I 've discovered something interesting , Charles .
WHEELER: keep them from that area , on grounds of relevancy . What , Bob ?
SEIDMAN: No matter how hard I try , I ca n't lose a file in my computer . NOW he 's got EVERYONE 'S attention .
BELINDA: I do n't think I should hear this .
SEIDMAN: You can erase the backup But why would you ?
KENTON: What 's the point , Bob ?
WHEELER: Very interesting , Bob . Let 's make a note of that . Andy did n't lose the complaint in his computer . He never put it in . He lied about that , too .
SEIDMAN: Charles
WHEELER: If you feel differently , Bob , you should say so , when you 're called to the stand . After all , this is n't a conspiracy .
BELINDA: Why did you recruit Andrew Beckett to your firm ? Andrew uses all his strength to concentrate . Charles Wheeler speaks with great sincerity .
WHEELER: If you 're the owner of a majo league ball club , you recruit the hot rookie . And Andy was tremendously promising as a young attorney . That 's why we went after him , that 's why we hired him , and that 's why we stuck with him , year after year waiting fo the promise to be fulfilled . But it never was .
BELINDA: You kept giving him another chance ?
WHEELER: Of course we did . When you 've groomed someone they way we groomed Andy , nurturing him , lavishing all kinds of special treatment on him you 've made quite an investment . We were waiting for his promise to kick in , and deliver . But , ultimately , we could no longe ignore the gap between the promise and the reality This is one of the saddest times in my life . To sit in this court , testifying to Andy 's ultimate failure to make the grade . To discover that he is one of those people who wants to enefit by the system , but does n't want to play by the system 's ules . To think you know someone , only to find out you do n't know them at all . It 's heartbreaking .
BELINDA: Thank you . That 's all for now , Your Honor .
JUDGE GARNETT: Mr. Miller ? Joe rises . Adjusts his jacket . Wheeler waits .
JOE: Explain to me , if you can , Mr. Wheeler , explain this to me like I 'm a ten year-old . This trial is not about a disease , is that what you 're saying ? Not about you understandable , if unfounded , fea of catching AIDS through casual contact with someone who has it ? You 're saying , this trial is about Andrew Beckett 's character . Am I getting this right ?
WHEELER: Yes , character . To the extent that it affects a person 's ability to do a great job .
RACHEL: I did n't mind covering for Andy , ut I did wonder when was he planning to deal with his problem ? Andrew blinks what 's going on ?
WHEELER: Sometimes it seems like society is run by these kinds of people .
JOE: What kind of people ?
WHEELER: People who want to bend the rules
KILLCOYNE: If you want to be a leader in this society , you have to make certain sacrifices . Wheeler keeps speaking
WHEELER: to suit their personal desires , and the rest of us have to live with it .
KENTON: You have to make a decision is this guy partner material ?
JOE: Who makes the rules , Mr. Wheeler ? u > You ? < /u
SEIDMAN: Yes , I did see the lesions . I suspected he was sick CLOSE ON ANDREW closing his eyes .
WHEELER: The everyday , common person with decent values
RACHEL: It seems like he was n't willing to face the reality of his situation
SEIDMAN: I did n't tell the others , I was afraid to
WHEELER: But now , we 're standing up fo ourselves
SEIDMAN: But we should n't have fired him
WHEELER: It 's time to get this society ack on track !
ANDREW: Could you call an ambulance , please ?
MIGUEL: It 's making it worse . Take it out . Take it out !
WAITRESS JUROR: They wanted to see if he 'd rise to the challenge . An American flag hangs on the wall .
SCHOOLTEACHER JUROR: They wanted to give him a final chance .
BUSINESSMAN JUROR: I 'd still love to know what happened to that missing file .
HOMEMAKER JUROR: Would n't we all ?
BUSINESSMAN JUROR: Why would they fire him ? Why not a medical leave , or
SCHOOLTEACHER JUROR: They hate homosexuals .
BUSINESSMAN JUROR: It 's not against the law to disapprove of homosexuals .
LESBIAN JUROR: It is against the law to fire someone for having AIDS . That 's why we 're here .
BUSINESSMAN JUROR: You 're the foreman . You have n't said anything . What do you think ?
MARINE JUROR: They 're saying he was n't a good lawyer . He was mediocre . And the fact that they gave him the most important lawsuit they 'd ever had , for one of their most important clients they say that does n't prove anything , because that was just a test . What did they call it ? A carrot . To see if he 'd rise to the occasion Okay Say I 've got to send a pilot into enemy territory , and he 's gon na e flying a plane that cost 350 million dollars Who am I going to put into that plane ? A rookie who ca n't cut the grade , because I want to see if he 'll rise to the challenge ? Or am I going to give that assignment to my best pilot , my most experienced , my sharpest , my top gun The very est I 've got ?
MARINE: We have , Your Honor Charles Wheeler looks the Marine in the eye .
JUDGE GARNETT: Have you awarded any damages ?
MARINE: Yes , we have , Your Honor . For back pay and loss of benefits one hundred fortythree thousand dollars .
DR. GILLMAN: if he comes out of the hospital this time , you must n't expect him to be like he was efore Joe steps into
ANDREW: What do you call a thousand lawyers chained together at the bottom of the ocean ?
JOE: What ?
ANDREW: A good start . Joe smiles .
JOE: It was good working with you , Andrew . You 're welcome . Hey . Should n't you put that thing back on ?
ANDREW: Sure thing . Joe stands .
JOE: I 'll see you , Beckett .
ANDREW: Thanks for coming by .
JOE: You bet . We 'll see you later . Joe heads for the door , meeting Miguel there .
MIGUEL: We just want to get him home . Thanks for stopping by , Joe .
JOE: Night . Joe leaves .
MIGUEL: He 's tired . He ought to sleep .
JOE: What do you call a thousand lawyers chained together at the bottom of the ocean ? The elevator doors close .
MATT: Night , Andy . See you tomorrow , uddy . Rev . Jim pats Andrew 's shoulder .
REV. JIM: God bless you , Andy . Bud Beckett kisses Andrew on the cheek .
BUD: Goodnight , son . Get some rest , okay ?
SARAH: Goodnight angel , my sweet boy
RANDY: Andy .
ANDREW: I 'm okay , bro . I 'll see you tomorrow .
MIGUEL: Ready for what , baby ?
ANDREW: Whatever .
MIGUEL: I hope you 're ready for `` Studs , '' ecause that 's what 's on . Andrew replaces the oxygen mask .
LISA: It 's Miguel . Joe sits bolt upright .
JOE: Miguel ?
NARRATOR: There are 237,911 pay telephones in the five burroughs of the city of New York . Many of them are still in working order .
MARIO: Stu , we got to talk .
STU: Wish I could accommodate you , Mario , but this is my busy time of day .
MARIO: How come you cross the street every time you go past the restaurant ?
STU: Why do n't I stop in later for some lunch ?
MARIO: There 's no more drinks or free meals until the restaurant starts showing up in the columns like you said .
STU: I 'm doing my level best for you people .
MARIO: One lousy mention in the Post and you expect to eat for six months !
STU: I got the food critic from the Village Voice all lined up to give you a review .
MARIO: That 's what you tell me last July . And he never shows .
STU: I was allowing you time to expand the menu . Wallpaper the bathrooms , for God sakes . You get only one shot with these fucking critics and I do n't want you to blow a rare opportunity .
MARIO: You the one blowing it . How long you think you can fuck everybody ?
STU: Hold on right there . I 've got a very excellent reputation around this town .
MARIO: So how come you take two nice suits of clothes from Harry and never get his daughter on David Letterman ?
STU: Hell , I 'm not an agent . I 'm a publicist .
MARIO: Mister , you 're nothing !
STU: Believe me , Valerie 's on the waiting list to audition . Harry 's got no complaints . He just let me pick out this tie the other day .
MARIO: That Harry 's a damn fool !
STU: Mario , please let me make this up to you . How about I arrange fo the opening night party for this new off-Broadway show I 'm handling to be held at your place with local TV coverage on nine and eleven ? I mean I had it promised to another client who actually pays me money . But it is n't firmed up yet . And I could throw it you way . Maybe .
MARIO: What is involved ?
STU: You 'd toss in the buffet for say seventy or eighty . The producers would supply their own vino , of course . I 'd deliver you a truckload of celebrities . And if they like the food , they 'll all come back , naturally .
MARIO: What celebrities ?
STU: You want Liza Minelli ? An Osca winner . Or Douglas Fairbanks , Jr. ?
MARIO: Is he still alive ?
STU: I saw him last night going into the Four Seasons . I 'll bring you ove a whole VIP list when we come by for dinner .
MARIO: How come everybody wants to eat but nobody wants to pay ?
STU: You ca n't think small like that . Hey , you still feature musicians Fridays and Saturdays ?
MARIO: At least they work for their meals .
STU: What about Harry 's daughter as an extra added attraction ? She 'll elt out five or six showtunes two sets a night and it wo n't cost you a fucking nickel .
MARIO: How come ?
STU: Star Showcase ! Let me handle setting that up . And when she eventually goes on Letterman , she 'll announce I 'm currently appearing over at Mario 's fine supper club . Right over CBS she 'll say that , Mario .
MARIO: You 're full of shit . You know that ? All bullshit !
STU: That 's just a vulgar word for PR . Mario , you ca n't hurt my feelings . Even when I was a kid and they hurled certain invectives my way , it never bothered me . Other kids would fall apart if anybody called them a fucking name . Me , I just loved the attention ! 'Shit-for- ains ' that 's what the bigge kids named me . And I answered to it . Hey , 'shit-for brains ' eporting for duty . Everybody loved me for that . I could take abuse . After a while , I kind of wore them down . There was nothing more they could say to me . So they stopped . I kind of missed it .
MARIO: I 'm sorry I even talked to you .
STU: I 'll bet your loving wife put you up to this . She saw me pass by and she sent you out in the street . But I do n't hold it against you personally you still serve up superior veal chop . Now I got urgent business to conduct , Mario . He slides the booth closed in Mario 's face .
MAVIS' VOICE: Where have you been ? Do you think I have nothing to do but wait around for you to call ?
STU: I 'm only a few minutes late , loveliest individual on earth .
MAVIS' VOICE: Stu , I 'm so lonely . When can I see you ?
STU: Good news in that arena . Kelly goes into rehearsal as of Monday . You know how dedicated she is . By the time she gets back from dancing her ass off , she goes right to sleep . We 'll have both our days and certain nights . Not to mention when they take the show on the oad .
MAVIS' VOICE: How long is that for ?
STU: Four to five weeks minimum .
MAVIS' VOICE: Maybe I should quit my job so we can be together full time .
STU: I would n't do that .
MAVIS' VOICE: Sometimes I think if I have to give one more fucking manicure
STU: That 's how you met me .
MAVIS' VOICE: I never saw a worse set of nails . Bit right down to the quick .
STU: I 'm much better groomed since you 've been looking after me .
MAVIS' VOICE: I 'm glad you admit it .
STU: Even Kelly remarked on it when I first met her .
MAVIS' VOICE: She could care less how you look . She 's only interested in pushing her own career . Some wife you 're stuck with !
STU: The marriage is not without its compensations . Do you imagine I could afford that apartment on what I 'm earning ? Not with everybody cutting back on the publicity . Not to mention a million college graduates coming into the profession trying to cut me out . And one thing you ca n't expect from your clients is loyalty . They get a couple of bad notices , they dump you . Goodbye .
MAVIS' VOICE: Do n't go .
STU: I was n't saying goodbye to you . I was saying how the clients try to give you the wave off without even a month 's notice .
MAVIS' VOICE: Why must you always be calling me from some booth ?
STU: On account of that phone records are regularly subpoenaed in divorce proceedings . And I do n't want some entry showing up on my cellula ill either . She gets the mail . She looks these items over . Sometimes she even dials up a strange number to see who it is .
MAVIS' VOICE: Then she suspects something .
STU: It 's only because her last husband , the choreographer , ran around on her . She ca n't get that out of he head . That 's how she caught onto him . The phone bills .
MAVIS' VOICE: She has n't developed much skill at holding a man .
STU: You know what a self-fulfilling prophecy is ? She was so sure I was going to find me a woman that she finally drove me back to you . I thought I 'd feel all guilty about it but I guess it has n't kicked in yet . Still , I would n't do anything to hurt her . Basically , Kelly 's a decent individual .
MAVIS' VOICE: What about hurting me ? Like last time ?
STU: Hurt ? You were glad to be rid of me .
MAVIS' VOICE: For a while I was , 'til I took stock of what was around . You 're the lesser of many evils .
STU: That 's about the nicest thing you ever said .
MAVIS' VOICE: I 'll have it engraved .
STU: We 've been up front with each othe from the beginning . Let 's keep it that way . How about a drink ? Say seven o'clock ? The Monkey Bar ?
MAVIS' VOICE: Meet me in front . I do n't like walking in there unescorted .
STU: Yeah , you 're great enough looking to be mistaken for one of those thousand dollar a night girls .
MAVIS' VOICE: It happens all the time lately .
STU: And wear that short black number I ought you from Bendel 's .
MAVIS' VOICE: Again ? I do n't know if it 's me o that dress you like .
STU: Have a good day . Make plenty of tips . And leave the whole evening open . She thinks I 've got Knicks tickets .
VOICE: Do n't even think about leaving that ooth .
STU: What ?
VOICE: Stay exactly where you are and listen carefully .
STU: I 've got a heavy day , mister .
VOICE: You know better than to disobey me .
STU: I do n't know you at all .
VOICE: Are you absolutely sure ?
STU: Who is this ?
VOICE: Someone who 's watching you .
STU: Get lost !
VOICE: Love the gray suit . That red and lack tie makes a nice combination .
STU: Where ? Where are you ?
VOICE: Closer than you think .
STU: I do n't see you .
VOICE: There are any number of windows . Check them out .
STU: Okay , you had your little joke .
VOICE: I 'm not sufficiently amused . Not yet . We have more to talk about .
STU: Do me a favor . Call up somebody else .
VOICE: But it 's you I 'm interested in . You know how many people use that ooth every day ?
STU: Why do n't you tell me ?
VOICE: Better than two-hundred people on average .
STU: Is that what you do ? Count them ?
VOICE: What else do I have to do ? It 's interesting watching people . Trying to guess who they are . And what they 're up to .
STU: What are you a shut-in of some kind ?
VOICE: You might say that . I ca n't go out . I might be seen .
STU: Somebody 's looking for you ?
VOICE: Desperately .
STU: The cops ?
VOICE: Not yet .
STU: The ex-wife . What 'd you do run out on child support ?
VOICE: What kind of man do you think I am ?
STU: Frankly , I could care less . You had your fun . Now goodbye .
VOICE: It 's not in your best interests to hang up on me . That would make me angry .
STU: Is n't that just too bad ?
VOICE: For you .
STU: There 's ten million names in the phonebook . Pester somebody else .
VOICE: I never talk to people I ca n't see . I need to study their reactions .
STU: Alright , bullshit artist , what am I doing right now ?
VOICE: Scratching your forehead with you left hand . Now you 're brushing your hair back .
STU: Okay , okay , you got me in you scrutiny . So what ?
VOICE: So let 's talk .
STU: Only I got nothing to say .
VOICE: Oh , you will . You 'll do a lot of talking before this conversation is over . And it 'll only end when I want it to .
STU: Is that a fact ? Well if you watch closely , you will see me hang up .
VOICE: I do n't think you will .
STU: Why not ?
VOICE: I interest you .
STU: Why should I be interested in some creep who gets his jollies spying on strangers in phone booths ?
VOICE: But you 're not a stranger , Stu .
STU: Who put you up to this ?
VOICE: You were my very own selection .
STU: Why me in particular ?
VOICE: Because you 're so afraid .
STU: Ha ! What 've I got to be afraid of ?
VOICE: Why else would a man with a perfectly good cellular bother to make calls from a pay booth ?
STU: That 's my business .
VOICE: I 've made it mine .
STU: All of a sudden I 'm required to give explanations to you ?
VOICE: In explicit detail .
STU: What is this ? Some kind of candid camera gag ? Or like that thing on HBO where the cab driver is taping what goes on in the back seat ?
VOICE: This is not showbusiness , my friend . This is reality .
STU: Your reality . Not mine , you lowlife fuck .
VOICE: Stu , you 'll be made to suffer fo your attitude , so let 's dispense with the vulgarities .
STU: Now you 're threatening me ! Fuck you . Could that be any clearer ?
VOICE: You 're only making it easier for me to do you harm .
STU: Oh yeah . Right . Can you see how I 'm trembling ?
VOICE: You will be .
STU: Shit , this is a new one . Fucking threatening calls in a goddam phone ooth . When are you going to start with the heavy breathing .
VOICE: I 'm not the degenerate . You are , Stu .
STU: You do n't know anything about me .
VOICE: Infinitely more than you know about me .
STU: Like what ?
VOICE: Like the number you dialed when you first entered the booth .
STU: How would you know that ?
VOICE: I 'm watching through a scope and I could clearly read the buttons you pushed . I have another extension here by the window . Shall I dial that same number back for you ? Would that convince you ?
VOICE: Let 's see who 's on the other end of the line .
STU: Do n't .
VOICE: Too late . It 's already ringing . I 'll hold the receiver up so you can listen in .
MAVIS' VOICE: Hello ?
VOICE: Well , hello .
MAVIS' VOICE: Who is this ?
VOICE: Someone who 's really tight with your boyfriend who just called you from his favorite phone booth .
MAVIS' VOICE: You know Stu ?
VOICE: Stu ? Oh , I know him better than anyone . What he does how he thinks . How he lies .
MAVIS' VOICE: Who the hell is this ?
VOICE: Stu is listening in . He knows what we 're both saying .
MAVIS' VOICE: Stu ? Is that true ? Are you there ?
VOICE: He does n't feel like talking .
STU: Mavis ! Just hang up the goddam phone .
VOICE: She ca n't hear you , Stu . Only me . Mavis , I 'm afraid Stu has n't been totally honest with you . But then he ca n't be honest with anyone , can he ?
MAVIS' VOICE: What 's your name ? To whom am I speaking ?
VOICE: You 've never heard of me , Mavis . He does n't want you to know I exist . He wishes I did n't exist . But there is n't anything he can do about that . Still there , Stu ? All you can do is listen .
STU: Mavis the guy is a fucking nutcase ! Hang the fuck up .
VOICE: She does n't want to . She wants to know all about us . Do n't you , Mavis ?
MAVIS' VOICE: Did his wife put you up to this ? That bitch , Kelly ?
VOICE: Oh yes , the bitch wife , Kelly . My very next call .
STU: He does n't know my wife ! Do n't tell him anything else .
FELICIA: Could you hurry it along ?
STU: Can you hear me , Mavis ? Keep you ig mouth shut .
VOICE: Is that any way to talk to a woman you love ? Mavis , is he always that abusive to you ?
MAVIS' VOICE: You 're getting me all upset . I do n't know who you are or how you know all this
VOICE: I find out things from watching people and listening to them .
MAVIS' VOICE: Just what is your relationship to Stu ? That 's all I want to know .
VOICE: Well , what do you think ?
MAVIS' VOICE: Answer me , goddam it !
VOICE: Well alright . Stu and I are longtime companions . A pair . Two of a kind . Closer than close . Peas in a pod . Spoons in a drawer .
MAVIS' VOICE: You pervert !
VOICE: That , too .
STU: Do n't believe a word of it . It 's all lies .
VOICE: Too late , Stu . She already elieves it .
MAVIS' VOICE: You can tell that scumbag never to other me again .
VOICE: He wo n't care . He 'll still have me .
STU: It 's not true . I do care .
FELICIA: Get done in there , mister . I got me an important call .
STU: Go away .
FELICIA: Shit I will ! Finish up !
VOICE: Why do n't you tell me what you think of us ?
MAVIS' VOICE: You 're both disgusting .
VOICE: That 's what he said about you . Well , if Stu did n't have the balls to come out and tell you the truth , I felt it was my responsibility to clear the air . Goodbye now , Mavis . Thanks for your time . Back to you again , Stu .
STU: You total asshole ! How could you do that ?
VOICE: Speaking of females , that woman hovering outside the booth may as well tell her that you 'll be on the line forever .
STU: Like hell I will .
VOICE: I 'm ready for you to take out you cellular and phone home . And this time , I 'll listen in .
STU: There 's no chance of that .
VOICE: Or should I call Kelly and make up something totally outrageous ? You must realize by now I have a vivid imagination .
STU: You do n't know our phone number !
VOICE: Are you absolutely sure ? I may have been watching you on a regula asis . Keeping track of all the numbers I see you dial .
STU: And I 'm supposed to believe that ?
VOICE: I 've put a great deal of preparation into this prior to actually saying hello . Now do you want to dial 832-7165 or should
STU: What are you going to tell her ?
VOICE: You 'll do the talking .
STU: What am I supposed to say ?
VOICE: Try telling her the truth .
STU: Look , I do n't want to hurt Kelly . She 's always there for me . It 's just my nature to have a little 'strange ' on the side . It does n't mean shit .
VOICE: But you still find it necessary ?
STU: Kind of like having a beautiful home . With everything you eve dreamed of . But you still need that vacation now and then . Some nice hotel room with a great view . Maybe a pool . Only you would n't want to spend more than a few days in any hotel . Eventually , you want to go back to your home and all your stuff . You 're real glad to check out .
VOICE: Kelly is home and Mavis is a hotel ? I 'm sure they 'll both appreciate that explanation .
STU: You 're ruining my fucking life , you sonofabitch .
VOICE: Did n't I warn you about calling me names ? It makes me vindictive .
STU: What else can you do to me ?
VOICE: We have n't even begun .
STU: She 's not home . She went out .
VOICE: I 'll bet she 's back . Now hold the cellular up where I can see it so I can be certain you do n't misdial on me . A little higher and to your left . Now I have it in perfect view . Dial slowly .
FELICIA: If you got you a cell phone , how come you taking up the whole fucking booth ! This here 's an emergency !
STU: There 's another booth on the next lock .
FELICIA: It 's busted . Every damn phone on Eighth Avenue is busted but this one .
STU: Well , I 'm not through ! Go in a estaurant or someplace , but get away from me !
FELICIA: I 'm gon na pull you out of that ooth and snatch you ballheaded !
STU: Let me hear from your lawyer !
FELICIA: You 're hear alright . I 'm coming ack . And your ass better not be around .
VOICE: Good work , Stu . Now let me see you dial . Tuck the receiver under you chin and dial your remote .
STU: I 'm doing it .
VOICE: Let it ring . Then a girl 's voice is heard .
KELLY'S VOICE: Shepard residence .
VOICE: Hold it close to the receiver so I can hear .
KELLY'S VOICE: Hello ?
STU: Honey , it 's me .
KELLY'S VOICE: What 's taking you so long ? I thought we were having some lunch at Mario 's ?
STU: Change of plan . We 're not eating in that dump any more .
KELLY'S VOICE: How come ?
STU: The Health Department gave them a ' C ' rating that 's how come . Here I 'm trying to put the place on the map and he fucks it all up with a major roach problem .
KELLY'S VOICE: That 's disgusting . Okay , I 'll fix us a sandwich . Where are you now ?
STU: Just in a phone booth .
KELLY'S VOICE: How come ? The caller ID says you 're on your cellular .
STU: Oh yeah , I am .
KELLY'S VOICE: But you 're also in some phone ooth ?
VOICE: Explain that one , Stu .
STU: I only stepped in because the traffic was so loud outside .
KELLY'S VOICE: Well just hurry on back .
VOICE: Tell her you ca n't .
STU: Not for a few minutes .
KELLY'S VOICE: Are you sure you 're alone ? I hea somebody in the background .
STU: The guy in the next booth . He 's got a bad connection and he 's hollering his fool head off .
VOICE: You 've got an answer fo everything .
STU: I love you , baby .
KELLY'S VOICE: Do you ?
STU: You know that .
KELLY'S VOICE: Stu who was that man ?
STU: What man ?
KELLY'S VOICE: Some person who phoned fifteen minutes ago just after you went out .
STU: I do n't understand
KELLY'S VOICE: This total stranger rang up and told me to wait by the phone ecause you 'd be calling me in a few minutes from a booth . And I said what would he be doing in any phone booth ?
STU: And what did this guy say ?
KELLY'S VOICE: He said you 'd be making phone calls . What else ?
STU: Making calls is part of my usiness .
KELLY'S VOICE: To whom ?
STU: Clients . People . Planting items like I do .
KELLY'S VOICE: Women ?
STU: Once in a while one of them could e a woman . I just called `` Elaine 's '' and talked to her to see who was in there last night .
KELLY'S VOICE: You know exactly what I mean .
STU: You 're not going to start that shit again ?
KELLY'S VOICE: I just feel something is wrong .
STU: What could be wrong ?
KELLY'S VOICE: The way you sound . You do n't sound like yourself .
STU: Yeah ? Who do I sound like ?
KELLY'S VOICE: Someone who 's scared . There 's fea in your voice like I 've never heard efore .
VOICE: See , Stu ? Kelly agrees with me .
KELLY'S VOICE: I want you to come back home . Now !
STU: I told you . In a while .
KELLY'S VOICE: No . I want you here now . In case he calls back , I do n't want to answer again .
STU: Why should he call back ?
KELLY'S VOICE: I feel like he 's going to .
STU: You 're the one that sounds frightened . And of nobody .
KELLY'S VOICE: He 's not a nobody . He knows about us .
STU: You 're not telling me all he said . What are you holding back ?
KELLY'S VOICE: I ca n't discuss it on the phone . Just get over here ! CLICK ! She hangs up .
STU: Why did you do that to her ? She never did you any harm .
VOICE: How would you know ? Everybody does harm to somebody . And then they try their best to forget it .
STU: Maybe me but not her . Whateve I 've done , there 's no reason to take it out on her .
VOICE: Suppose that 's the only way I can get to you ? You claim you love her .
STU: Yeah , I do .
VOICE: You do n't even love yourself .
STU: But Kelly I would never hurt .
VOICE: Still you have to uphold you status as an honorary asshole .
STU: Listen , I 've treated all my women decent . I never laid a hand on any of them , even when provoked . And I always let them down easy . I 'm not ready to let Kelly go . Maybe I never will be .
VOICE: What if she dumps you first ? What 's the odds she 's already taken up with somebody ? One day soon you 'll come home and find her gone along with the CD player and the
STU: I 'm not gon na let you mind-fuck me all day ! That 's it . This call is ended .
VOICE: Not until I say it is .
STU: What happens if I hang up ?
VOICE: You do n't really want to find out .
STU: I 'm dying to hear this ! ! ! What the fuck can you do about it up in your fucking high window with you goddam binoculars ?
VOICE: I never indicated I had binoculars . I said I had a highly magnified telescopic image of you that ought you up so close I could see where you nicked yourself under the chin shaving this morning .
STU: Oh while you 're at it , have a look up my ass .
VOICE: I may very well do that , Stu . In the meantime , think about what kind of device has a telescopic sight mounted on it .
STU: What ? You mean like a rifle ?
VOICE: A high-powered .30 calibre bolt action Remington 700 with a carbon one modification and a state of the art Henzholdt tactical sniperscope . And you 're in the cross hairs , Stu .
STU: I 'm supposed to believe that ?
VOICE: There 's only one way I can prove it to you . Hang up the receiver and find out . At this range , the exit wound ought to be about the size of a small tangerine .
STU: And you 're just going to kill me for no reason ?
VOICE: For plenty of reasons ! Because you hung up . For years I hated people hanging up on me . Ex-girlfriends . Women I did n't even know . Prospective employers .
STU: I get hung up on all the time . You get used to it .
VOICE: Or else you do n't . I worked fo months getting people to switch to MCI being insulted at and being hung up on hundreds of times a day . The ones that cursed me out fo invading their privacy neve othered me as much as those that clicked off without even bothering to reply .
STU: Then why did n't you go after one of them ?
VOICE: Maybe you are one of them .
STU: Hey , I have worked in a boiler room myself peddling `` Term Life . '' I Would never be rude to a fellow salesperson .
VOICE: Can you feel it on you now ? The heat of it . I 'm moving the strike zone down to your stomach area . Now I 'm raising it up again . Directly above the chest cavity sliding up to the forehead just above the left ear .
STU: Shit I do feel it .
VOICE: Tell me where I 'm going with it now .
STU: Across my forehead now back where it was before .
VOICE: I 'm amazed how you can do that . You 're amazingly accurate . Now I know what you 're thinking . If I drop down on the floor of the ooth and flatten myself out
STU: No , I 'm not thinking that .
VOICE: Oh yes you are . Can I crawl out using the booth as a shield ? Can I crawl to that Chrysler illegally parked only three or four feet away ? The shattering glass may cut me , but it 'll only be superficial . Otherwise , this lunatic will neve let me out alive .
STU: No . You will . I know you will . If I just cooperate .
VOICE: Where is it now ? Think and feel for the warm spot .
STU: Below the shoulder ?
VOICE: Which one ?
STU: The right shoulder .
VOICE: Remarkable how we 're in tune . You 're doing far better than the others .
STU: What others ? What do you mean ? You said 'others ! '
VOICE: I 'm sure you read about the Italian tourist shot dead ten days ago at the corner of Forty-fifth and Eighth ?
STU: I saw it on the news .
VOICE: And where are we now ?
STU: Oh , God . Forty-fifth and Eighth .
VOICE: What else do you remember about that killing ?
STU: I do n't know .
VOICE: Try .
STU: He was gunned down . And nobody was caught . And they did n't even other to take his wallet or his watch or anything .
VOICE: Now you know why . It was n't a obbery .
STU: What did he do ?
VOICE: He hung up so I disconnected him permanently .
STU: Please do n't do it to me . You got no reason to do it to me .
VOICE: Do n't give me reason .
STU: I 'm not looking to . Tell me what you want !
VOICE: Tell me about your job .
STU: What 's to tell ? I 'm in Public Relations . They used to call us `` flacks . '' Now we 're media consultants .
VOICE: What do you do , exactly ?
STU: Plant items in the paper and on the tube . More important sometimes , keep stuff out .
VOICE: What 've you kept out ?
STU: One of my people got nailed fo indecent exposure . I managed fo the cops to use his real name instead of his stage name so nobody picked up on it .
VOICE: You saved the little deviate 's ass , did n't you ?
STU: He 's in major therapy now . I swea he is .
VOICE: You must hang with some majo celebrities . Journalists , newscasters those types .
STU: I 'm real close with Larry King . And the `` Hard Copy '' people .
VOICE: Could you get him down here ? Larry King ?
STU: Why would he want to come here ?
VOICE: Because you asked him to .
STU: He comes from Atlanta .
VOICE: Well , who could you get ?
STU: I do n't know .
VOICE: Wolf Blitzer ?
STU: Definitely no chance .
VOICE: You 'd be offering them an exclusive newsbreak . I 'm talking about more than one homicide .
STU: How many ?
VOICE: I do n't answer questions . I ask them .
STU: I got ta have the facts . They might not believe me . My record is n't too good when it comes to hard news .
VOICE: You 're not considered a reliable source ?
STU: On a divorce or separation , maybe . Or who 's gay , or who is n't gay any more . I kind of specialize in that kind of material . I mean I could probably get you Joe Franklin .
VOICE: How about Cindy Adams ?
STU: I might have a shot . Are you familiar with Liz Smith ?
VOICE: Do you know her number ?
STU: Want I should call her ? How much can I say ?
VOICE: Tell her you 're in direct touch with a killer who 's willing to speak honestly if she shows up here alone and without notifying the authorities .
STU: She usually likes to have a celebrity involved . If you had an actor or a sports figure held prisoner instead of me , there 'd be etter odds she 's come .
VOICE: Then lie . Pick a celebrity and put them in the booth .
STU: Let 's see . Who does she like ? Who could n't be reached to deny it ?
VOICE: I 'm anxious to see you in action . Do n't keep me waiting . Stu uses his cellular again .
STU: Sometimes you only get her service . Hi Stu Shepard . Put me through . I 've got hard news for her . I can only talk to her directly . But say it regards Liza .
VOICE: Liza ? That was imaginative .
STU: No , I ca n't call back . I 'll have to lay in on somebody else . Alright , but I ca n't hang on long . She 's coming on . Liz , hello . Sure I 'll make it ief . Killing two weeks ago in the theatre district ? Turn out a sniper did the job . Yeah , a snipe with a rifle . Now he 's got anothe victim lined up . Not just you anonymous New Yorker , but Liza . Now you ca n't call anybody or Ms. Minelli 's dead meat and so am I . She 's hostage in a phone booth ight in the sniper 's sights . But he says he 'll talk to you and let her walk . I know it 'll take balls to do this , but you 're a fine and courageous newspaper woman There 's a click . Silence .
VOICE: You were n't particularly convincing .
STU: I did n't really believe in what I was saying .
VOICE: Because you do n't really believe my Remington is pointed at you ?
STU: I do .
VOICE: You 're ninety percent sure .
STU: At least ninety-five percent , easy .
VOICE: Let me erase all doubt .
STU: No . Do n't shoot .
VOICE: Control yourself , Stu . Glance down at your chest . What do you see .
STU: Oh , my God . A dot . A fucking red dot . A tiny red dot now moves across Stu 's chest .
VOICE: Like you 've seen in the movies ?
STU: The laser dot . Just before some poor bastard always gets blown away .
VOICE: Usually a supporting player . That lovely but by now generic special effect of the bullet piercing the forehead .
STU: Do n't tighten . Do n't even tickle that fucking finger .
VOICE: How about Geraldo ? He 's run his ass off to get in on this .
STU: You 're talking about the old Geraldo . Look , I can try and reach cable NBC . They 're hungry .
VOICE: I 'm disappointed . I wanted to go first class .
STU: They do a great job . They 'll haul a whole crew over to cover you surrender `` live . ''
VOICE: I never expressed interest in giving myself up . There are so many other phone booths in the city . I 'm just getting warmed up .
STU: That 's entirely up to you . You choice . I 'm just trying to set you up with the proper communicator . I suppose Liza was n't strong enough . I should 've said Madonna .
VOICE: Now you 're being creative .
LEON: Drag your baggy butt out of that ooth . We got business to conduct out of there .
FELICIA: He been in there all day .
STU: I 'm not through .
LEON: Hang up that receiver or I 'll make you eat the fucking thing !
STU: Fuck off or I 'll call a cop .
LEON: Do you see one around here ? What you think I 'm gon na be doing while you 're waiting for a prowl car to get assigned ? I 'm about to cut you a second asshole if you do n't vacate those premises .
STU: I ca n't .
FELICIA: He 's got him a fucking cellular . What 's he need to be on our booth for ?
STU: I ca n't explain it .
LEON: I 'm not interested in you explanations even if you had any .
STU: I 'll make it worth your while to go away . How much do you want ?
LEON: Make me an offer .
STU: Thirty dollars . It 's all I 've got in cash . Take it and go .
LEON: You 're offering to rent my phone ooth ? For how long ?
STU: I do n't know . For as long as it takes .
LEON: What 's so special in there ?
STU: Do you want the money ?
LEON: Is that a genuine Rolex you 've got on ?
STU: Come on , man . That 's my good watch .
LEON: That 's what it 's gon na take .
STU: Then here . Take the damn thing .
LEON: And the thirty !
STU: Take it all .
LEON: Now I 'm satisfied . But you still got to deal with Felicia here . I elieve you spoke harshly to her .
STU: I apologize .
LEON: And did her some injury .
STU: An accident . I 'm sorry about that , too .
FELICIA: The man do n't sound like he means it .
LEON: I agree . Why do n't you hang up a minute so we can discuss this matter at length .
STU: It 's long distance . I ca n't lose the call I might not get them ack .
LEON: Do I have to rip that fucking phone out of there ?
STU: That would n't be a good idea . Would it ?
VOICE: Not at all .
STU: I gave you everything I 've got .
LEON: That pinky ring looks attractive . Felicia might like that .
FELICIA: It might fit .
STU: You want the ring , you 've got the ing . If I can get it off .
LEON: I can get it off you . Leon reaches in and grabs Stu 's ring hand .
STU: Let go of me ! It 's coming loose . There . Okay , Felicia , with my deepest apologies . Goodbye now .
LEON: What 's really going on in that ooth that escapes the naked eye ?
STU: Nothing . Talk . That 's all .
LEON: That your connection on the end of the line ? Or are you dealing ?
STU: This has nothing to do with drugs .
LEON: You got ta be high on something to willingly divest yourself of you valuables just to maintain occupancy of a fucking phone booth that the local bums piss in every night .
STU: I knew it smelled for some reason .
LEON: You look like you 're ready to piss yourself .
STU: Because I am .
LEON: Maybe if the city provided decent public toilets , folks would n't elieve themselves in the subway stations and phone booths !
STU: I 'll take it up with the mayor .
LEON: Next thing you know you 're gon na claim we mugged you took you illfold and watch .
STU: No , you did n't . It was a fair and equitable deal . You had territorial rights to this booth and I paid a license fee . Fair is fair . Now leave me in peace .
LEON: You sure you 're alright ? He do n't look well .
FELICIA: Kind of pale . Even for a white man .
LEON: Jaundice they calls it . Probably advanced liver trouble . If it 's cirrhosis , you better find yourself a twelve step program and quick .
STU: Thanks for your interest but I 'm in perfect health .
FELICIA: So how come his hand is shaking ?
LEON: The man is cracking up .
FELICIA: Lookit the sweat pouring off the sonofabitch . That 's one sick mother you started up with , Leon !
LEON: Me ? You 're the one that brought me over and exposed me to all his germs .
STU: I 'm terminal , okay ? Now can I close the booth and continue my conversation ?
LEON: I 'm worried now it might be catching . All that money out of your sweaty pocket is probably crawling with some rare and incurable disease .
STU: Fine . Give it back .
LEON: What good 's that ? We done touched it .
STU: Well go wash your hands .
LEON: Come on now . Own up to what you 're carrying . Is it some of that sexually transmitted shit ? Cause in that case , we can relax .
STU: I 'm sick of you . Now get out of my face .
LEON: Here we 's being solicitous as to your health and you respond by heaping abuse !
FELICIA: Whip his arrogant ass .
STU: Touch me and I 'll throw up on you . At the suggestion , Leon lets go quickly .
VOICE: Want me to get rid of him for you ?
STU: What do you have in mind ?
VOICE: I 'll think of something .
STU: God no . Do n't . It 's not necessary .
VOICE: You asked for my help .
STU: I 'll handle it myself .
VOICE: You 're not doing too well . I can settle it in a fraction of a second . Shall I demonstrate ?
STU: No . For your own safety , mister , just walk away .
LEON: Now the man is turning aggressive issuing threats upon my person .
STU: You 're making this happen .
LEON: If you do n't hang up and step out , I 'm about to topple this booth into the gutter with you inside it .
STU: This is n't my fault . Stop that !
VOICE: Only one way to stop a mad dog . Give me permission .
STU: I ca n't .
VOICE: If he forces you out of that booth , I 've told you what to expect . You or him , Stu .
FELICIA: Do n't cut yourself , honey .
DERELICT: Looks like the fucker is comin ' loose .
STREET PERSON: Shove it out into the oncoming traffic .
DERELICT: What 'll you bet the bus could knock that fifty feet ?
STU: Hello ? Hello ?
VOICE: You 're breaking up . We 're about to e cut off .
STU: I ca n't help it !
VOICE: That counts as a hang-up .
STU: No . It ca n't . That 's not fair .
VOICE: I can still make him stop . Say the word . Can you hear me ?
STU: Yes .
VOICE: You said 'yes . '
STU: I said 'Yes , I can hear you . ' Not 'Yes kill the motherfucker ! '
VOICE: Do n't try to renege on it . I was following orders .
STU: You 're twisting it all around . I did n't do this !
FELICIA: I warned you not to cut yourself . Look at all that blood . He must 've hit an artery .
DERELICT: Gunshot !
STREET PERSON: Yeah . Sucking chest wound right over the heart .
FELICIA: Somebody call an ambulance .
STREET PERSON: Call the meatwagon . He 's fucked up .
FELICIA: You shut the fuck up !
STU: I did n't .
FELICIA: You all saw it ! He shot my man without no provocation !
DERELICT: Yeah . Pumped one right into him at close range .
STU: How could I ? I do n't even have a gun . Look !
STREET PERSON: Everybody get the fuck back ! They shoot one then they shoot everybody in sight ! Kill all the fucking witnesses !
STU: Come back . You 've got to see I 'm not armed .
FELICIA: Hang up and dial 911 . Get a doctor !
STU: I ca n't hang up . That 's what this is all about .
FELICIA: You 're gon na stand there and let him die ?
STU: I can use this . Emergency . Yes . There 's been a shooting at Forty-fifth and Eighth on the corner . A man is down . What 's the difference who I am ? I do n't want to be involved .
FELICIA: That 's bullshit . He 's the shooter . You 're talking to the shooter . Stu quickly disconnects the cellular .
STU: That was n't nice .
FELICIA: Go ahead make a fucking run fo it . I hope they gun you down like you did him !
STU: I 'm not going anyplace . I 'm staying right here in this booth . Unless you give me permission .
VOICE: You 're attracting a lot of attention . I suppose when the police get there , you 'll accuse me .
STU: What do you expect me to say ?
VOICE: That 's up to you . But any mention of me will not be appreciated .
STU: You mean ?
VOICE: You wo n't even get to finish you sentence . Oh look , that little red dot is dancing around all over you again . You saw how quickly it can happen . And how accurate I can be .
STU: They ca n't blame me I 'm not armed .
VOICE: Who 's going to believe that ? With all those witnesses to the contrary .
STU: They can see with their own eyes .
VOICE: Remember to leave me out of it .
STU: How can I ?
VOICE: You 'll put the proper spin on it . Is n't that your specialty ? Feeding the public a story that may not have a shred of truth and making it totally believable ?
STU: This is n't a story . This is real . This is murder .
VOICE: If you 'd only dealt with the man easonably , shown him some respect , this might not have been necessary .
STU: I gave him my money , my watch
VOICE: But not your respect . Which is what he required of you .
STU: He was a fucking thief .
VOICE: And now he 's a fucking dead thief . Do you feel better about that ?
STU: I do n't feel a bit guilty . This is all your doing !
VOICE: Now you 're being disrespectful of me . You never learn . Your job is to deal with people but you 're not good at it .
STU: Hey , I 'm not taking any more criticism from some lunatic snipe who gets his kicks killing strangers .
VOICE: You keep insisting I 'm a stranger . Probably because you do n't ecognize the voice . But there are cheap electronic devices available that disguise the voice . I might not even be a man . I might be one of those many women you 've almost totally forgotten . One who does n't forgive easily . One who wants to watch you squirm .
STU: You 're a man . I know you 're a man . Women do n't kill with telescopic ifles . They stab you .
VOICE: You sound so sure of that . But you 've never provoked any man as much as have the women in you life . And so many of them , Stu . Do you even remember their names ?
STU: I 've got no time to rehash my whole life . Oh my God ! The cops are here .
FELICIA: That 's him in the booth . He 's got a gun !
SERGEANT: Throw down your weapon and come out with your hands raised .
STU: They 're ordering me to come out .
VOICE: I can see that . Ignore them .
STU: What if they open fire ?
VOICE: They probably wo n't . Look across on the east side of the street . Do you see the tourist with the home video camera ?
STU: What about him ?
VOICE: He 's going to keep the police on their best behavior . So long as you do n't take what could be interpreted as hostile action , you 'll be safe .
STU: You call this safe ? Six cops with guns pointed my way ?
VOICE: You want me to reduce them to three or two ?
STU: Absolutely no more shooting . Now is that clear ?
VOICE: You can always change your mind .
SERGEANT: You know the drill . Hands clasped ehind the back of your neck moving slowly step out of the ooth . If we see any sign of a weapon , we will respond .
STU: You wo n't , because there is n't any .
SERGEANT: I repeat . Raise your hands .
STU: I ca n't . I 'm on a phone call .
CAPTAIN RAMEY: You have thirty seconds to comply .
STU: I told you . I 'm busy . Come back later .
VOICE: Very good , Stu .
RAMEY: You 've been given an order .
SERGEANT: We 're dealing with a mental case . He 's looking for us to kill him .
RAMEY: Well he 's not getting his wish .
FELICIA: Tell me he 's gon na be alright .
MEDIC: Step aside . Let us look at him .
SERGEANT: Same corner as two weeks ago .
RAMEY: Maybe it 's more than a coincidence . Cover me . I need to talk to him .
SERGEANT: You 've got your vest on ?
RAMEY: What do you think ?
STU: Neither am I .
RAMEY: Yeah , sure . I need to know what happened .
STU: Ca n't talk about it .
RAMEY: Sure you can . My name 's Ramey . Captain Ed Ramey . What 's yours ?
STU: Look , I do n't want to be friends .
RAMEY: You look like you need a friend .
VOICE: Tell him you 've already got a friend .
STU: I 've got a friend , okay .
RAMEY: Is that who you 're talking to on the phone ?
STU: None of your business .
RAMEY: When somebody gets shot , it becomes my business . Let 's not have anybody else killed . I want to hear your side of it .
STU: I 've got no side of it .
VOICE: Do n't worry , Stu . I 've got him fixed right in my sights . I wo n't let him hurt you .
RAMEY: Has this happened to you before ? The need to hurt someone ? To put a ullet in them ?
STU: You wo n't believe anything I say .
RAMEY: Try me .
STU: I could n't shoot anybody . I 'm not armed .
RAMEY: You 're right . I do n't believe you . What 's that bulge in your pants pocket ?
STU: That ? That 's my cellular .
RAMEY: A cellular ? Then what are you doing in a phone booth making calls ?
STU: Do you want to see it ?
RAMEY: Do n't reach for it , mister .
STU: Then how can I show it to you ?
RAMEY: I do n't need to see it . I know what 's there . All these witnesses saw you use it on him .
STREET PERSON: Damn straight !
DERELICT: Yeah ! Shot him down like a dog !
STU: They 're all lying . Nobody saw it ecause it did n't happen .
RAMEY: A man is dead but it did n't happen .
STU: Not on account of me ! This is like some bad dream .
RAMEY: You 're walking through a bad dream and you ca n't wake up . Do you want to wake up ?
STU: I 'm trying .
RAMEY: And in this dream , you killed that man . He was bothering you so you iced him .
STU: No .
RAMEY: Then who did ?
VOICE: Do n't tell him , Stu . Or it 'll be the last thing he ever hears . His lood will be on your hands .
STU: I do n't know .
RAMEY: But you saw it happen ?
STU: Yes .
RAMEY: You were the closest one to him . You must 've seen who did it .
STU: No .
RAMEY: We 're trying to be honest with each other , are n't we ?
STU: Not necessarily .
VOICE: I 'm losing patience with this cop .
STU: I 'm handling this .
RAMEY: Who do you keep talking to on the phone ?
STU: Nobody . My psychiatrist .
VOICE: Excellent , Stu . You 're getting good at this .
RAMEY: What 's this doctor 's name ? It 's important we know .
STU: He says not to tell you . It 's privileged information .
VOICE: Damn good reply . Now you 're having fun . Admit it .
STU: Whatever you say .
VOICE: Playing it so close to the edge . I 'll bet you 've never felt so alive . That 's how I feel when I look through the sight and select somebody .
RAMEY: I respect your right to privacy . I 've been to therapy myself . The department provides it . I know it 's not good form for a cop to be admitting that , but
VOICE: Tell him not to come any closer .
STU: Stop right there . Back up a few steps . Back where you were .
RAMEY: If it makes you more comfortable .
VOICE: Tell him to read you your rights .
STU: I want you to read me my rights and stop asking questions .
RAMEY: Al least tell me your first name .
STU: It 's my right not to have any name .
RAMEY: No gun and no name . You 're a highly underprivileged person .
VOICE: Demand a lawyer .
STU: And get me a lawyer , too . I want a lawyer brought down here to negotiate my surrender .
VOICE: Brilliant , Stu . Keep winging it .
RAMEY: It 'll be hard to find a lawye willing to risk his life . But if you hand over the gun
STU: How can I when you wo n't let me take it out ?
RAMEY: We 'll take it out for you as soon as you exit the booth with your hands raised and
STU: Now we 're back to that again . It 's always `` Get out of the booth . ' 'You ca n't stay in the booth . ' Well , I like it in the fucking ooth . It 's my whole world now . It 's my booth and I 'm never coming out .
RAMEY: We 're not about to force you ecause there could be a miscalculation and then we 'd neve find out why this happened .
STU: Why is it so important to know ? The guy is dead . Is n't that enough ? Knowing is n't going to make him alive again . So who gives a fuck !
RAMEY: It 's what makes the jo interesting . Finding out why . Something drove you to do this . You did n't go out today expecting this to happen . It was a nice day . You were out for a walk . And then suddenly it all changed .
STU: All I wanted was to make a phone call . One lousy phone call fo thirty-five fucking cents .
VOICE: Careful , Stu . Do n't volunteer too much .
RAMEY: You got some bad news on that call .
STU: The worst .
RAMEY: Something that pushed you over the edge ?
STU: And I 've been falling ever since .
RAMEY: Time to land .
STU: When you hit bottom , you die .
RAMEY: I 'm your safety net .
STU: If I tell you what you want to know you 'll die , too .
RAMEY: I 'll go see about that lawyer .
STU: Now that 's a good idea . The Captain withdraws back across the street .
VOICE: He 's lucky . I had him centered in my cross hairs . I really had to estrain myself . We hear the approach of a helicopter .
STU: They 're just hoping for coverage of me dying in the gutter .
VOICE: Their presence is putting the police on their continued best ehavior .
STU: Those cops are just looking for any excuse .
VOICE: Then do n't give them one .
STU: Kelly . She was worried about me .
VOICE: Maybe she 's seen this on television . It must be on every channel by now . Breaking news .
STU: She does n't watch daytime TV .
VOICE: One of the neighbors could 've alerted her .
STU: Why are you saying this ? You want me to reach in my pocket so you can see them open fire ?
VOICE: That 's an unwarranted accusation and very unbecoming in light of the good advice I 've given in the past . Have I ever steered you wrong ?
STU: God how I 'd love to hear he voice .
VOICE: It might even be worth it . She 's insistent , is n't she ? The cellular wo n't stop ringing .
STU: If she knows I 'm in trouble , she wo n't give up .
VOICE: Probably glued to the TV by now . I 'm watching coverage on two stations now . Channel surfing . Well , there you are on two and fou and five . Not any decent angles on you , though , stuck inside there .
STU: You said I 'm not allowed to leave the booth . Finally the cell phone stops ringing .
VOICE: I might be willing to bend the ules and let you enjoy your moment of fame . Set the phone down without hanging up and take a step or two outside . Just for a minute . Then come straight back in or I 'll be forced to provide 'live ' coverage that should rival the historic Zapruder footage . Nothing like an exploding head to excite viewer interest .
STU: No , thanks . I 'll stay where I am .
VOICE: It was only a suggestion . Since you 're convinced I 'm going to plug you anyway , it ca n't matter much .
STU: If you shoot me , you give yourself away .
VOICE: Even without a muffler , they 'd never hear the report with all this noise . Afterwards , it 'd take them a good ten minutes to realize you were n't plugged by some overzealous officer . Then they 'll blame the media for inciting a crackpot vigilante to come down here and do the SWAT team 's job for them .
STU: You expected them to come . You had this all worked out .
VOICE: I write the scenario and you all play your parts as directed .
STU: Poor Kelly . What she must be going through .
VOICE: Why do n't you tell her how you feel about her ?
STU: I 'd never get the words out . Not with fifteen or twenty rounds in me .
VOICE: You ca n't be certain they 'd fire . They 'd see it was only a phone .
STU: They would n't wait to see .
VOICE: Is she ?
STU: The blonde girl in the green jacket .
VOICE: Ca n't miss her . Very attractive , is n't she ?
STU: She must 've heard all the commotion and come downstairs . The cellular is still ringing .
VOICE: You continue to impress .
STU: Why is it so important that they kill me ?
VOICE: Because that 's how I win .
STU: This time you wo n't . If you want me dead , you 'll have to do it yourself .
VOICE: Either way I ca n't lose .
STU: It 's all a game to you because you 're incapable of feelings . You 're not even human .
VOICE: I pride myself on that . What 's so great about being human ? It 's the lowest form of life on this planet and I 've taken it upon myself to thin the herd .
STU: I quit . I 'm not answering back any more . I wo n't hang up but I 'm not playing . There 's silence now between them .
VOICE: Stu ? Stu , do n't be that way . You 're taking the pleasure out of it .
SERGEANT: This here 's Helfand , of New York Telephone .
HELFAND: Glad to help out .
RAMEY: Have you got the number of that ooth ?
HELFAND: Sure do .
RAMEY: Can you tap into that call ?
HELFAND: It can be done .
SERGEANT: But not without a warrant . You could be violating this psycho 's civil rights . Especially if he 's on the line with his fucking psychiatrist .
RAMEY: Shit . I do n't want to blow this on a technicality . Tracing the call is n't any violation , is it ?
SERGEANT: As long as we do n't listen in .
RAMEY: Okay , we 've got to know who he 's talking to and their current location .
HELFAND: That I can handle . As long as they keep the circuit open .
RAMEY: I need the number and an address to go with it .
VOICE: Stuart , my friend . Do you want to see how close I can come without actually hitting you ?
STU: No !
VOICE: What was that ? Louder , Stu . We must have a bad connection .
STU: Leave her out of it .
VOICE: I did n't expect her to show up here . But since she has I 'll improvise .
STU: Do n't . Please do n't . I 'm sorry . I 'm talking to you again . I 'll talk all you want !
VOICE: It 's a bad dye job . The black oots are growing in and it makes her look cheap .
STU: I 've screwed up her life enough already . Please do n't hurt her .
VOICE: I do n't necessarily have to kill her . I could be persuaded to settle for a reasonable mutilation . Which part of her displeases you most ? If she turns a bit more in profile , I 'm accurate enough to emove the tip of her unpleasantly protruding nose . It 's just cartilage . Any decent cosmetic surgeon will have her looking etter than ever .
VOICE: You can see her talking to the police now . She 's identifying herself as your wife . They 're very interested in who you are . They 're taking her over to see the office in charge . What was his name ?
KELLY: What do you mean psychiatrist ? He does n't see any psychiatrist .
RAMEY: Then who 'd your husband be talking to ?
KELLY: There was some guy that called the house this morning and said weird stuff to me .
RAMEY: Stu seems to be checking things out with this person .
KELLY: He has n't got many friends I can tell you that .
RAMEY: Remain here , please . We may need you later .
KELLY: You wo n't hurt him ?
RAMEY: We 'll do our best not to .
VOICE: She wo n't even feel it when it happens .
STU: Take me instead .
VOICE: Do n't distract me . Now 's the time to be absolutely still . I have to hold my breath as I squeeze gently
STU: No ! I 'm hanging up . That 's it . Stu hangs up the receiver . He disconnects .
RAMEY: Shit . He hung up .
SERGEANT: Maybe they already traced it . Anyhow , it does n't matter . Looks like he 's coming out .
STU: I 've giving myself up . Take me !
SWAT OFFICER: First the gun . We want to see you toss away your weapon !
STU: Shit . I ca n't .
SWAT OFFICER: Freeze where you are ! Turn around and keep those hands clasped . Take him .
SERGEANT: What is going on with these fucking phone calls ?
RAMEY: Hold your fire . Let him answer it .
SERGEANT: Are you nuts ?
RAMEY: Let them talk . He 's not going anywhere . He 's going back inside the booth .
STU: Yeah ?
VOICE: Aw , relax , Stu . Only yanking you chain . Now can we start over ?
STU: Those cops wo n't wait much longer .
VOICE: What else can they do ? They ca n't afford to just shoot you like I can . Not with so much media coverage . Not unless you make some stupid aggressive move . The ABC Mobile Unit just rolled up .
STU: Will you look at that ? I must be going out over the network . Bet they 're pre-empting usual programming .
VOICE: And just think if you survive this , your trial will be televised . And you can try and make the world elieve I ever existed . I 'd be your only defense .
STU: How are they gon na prove that I killed anybody when there 's no gun ?
VOICE: They 'll plant one . The police are n't above that when they 're desperate to convict .
STU: No , sir . No gun and I walk .
VOICE: Do n't you think I took that into account ? Am I a fool ?
STU: What do you mean ?
VOICE: Have n't I considered every eventuality ? I knew they 'd come and cordon off the block . And that there 'd have to be a gun someplace .
STU: Where ?
VOICE: It 's a small booth , Stu . Have you checked every inch of it ?
STU: It 's not on the floor .
VOICE: Then what 's left ?
STU: Up above .
VOICE: Could be . Why do n't you reach up there and lift the plastic sheet and feel around .
STU: If they see me reach for something , they could open fire .
VOICE: They could . But you have to know if it 's there . Do n't you ?
STU: I totally do n't give a shit .
VOICE: In a narrow space , tucked just to the left of the fluorescent bulb . You can almost see it outlined if you look closely .
STU: It does n't matter . I know about allistics . The slug in that dead guy came from your rifle , not any handgun .
VOICE: You saw how hollow points splinte on impact . There 's nothing much for ballistics to match to . The same make .30 calibre bullets are in that handgun . The prosecution ests .
STU: There 's no gun up there . I do n't see a damn thing .
VOICE: Slide your finger up under the plastic and you 'll feel the cold metal surface . There are fou ounds left in it . Should you decide to shoot your way out .
STU: I could never shoot anybody .
VOICE: You could shoot me , Stu . You 'd do that in a minute if you could .
STU: And I 'd fucking love it !
VOICE: Now you 're speaking from the heart . Come on , just lift the partition a few inches and feel what 's there for you .
STU: I 'm not getting my fingerprints on your fucking weapon . What about powder residue ? How are they going to explain that to a jury ?
VOICE: Do you think that 'll matter with so many eye witnesses ? Do it or should I re-focus my attention on Kelly ?
STU: No .
VOICE: You carefully distracted me from her before and I let you get away with it . But if you 're not going to play fairly There she is again . So close I feel like I could touch her .
STU: Get off her !
VOICE: Then mind me when I speak .
STU: Look ! I 'm reaching up with my left hand . I 'm pushing against the partition . It 's giving . I 'm feeling around with my fingertips . It 's filthy up there .
VOICE: One of the finest handguns Remington makes . Lightweight , efficient and highly accurate .
STU: I 'm not picking it up .
VOICE: Not right now . But eventually Stu lowers his hand , still empty .
STU: I would n't have a chance .
VOICE: I never said you would .
STU: I 'm not insane .
VOICE: But you 're getting there . It would n't take much .
STU: That wo n't happen .
VOICE: You could pull the gun down , shove it in your own mouth and jerk the trigger . That 's another option .
STU: Why would I do that ?
VOICE: To please me . And ensure that nothing happens to Kelly . I do n't necessarily have to deal with he today in the midst of a crowd of cops . I can take her out any time I like . When she goes to pull down her blinds at night or when she walks the dog first thing in the morning . What is it a Jack Russell ?
STU: Okay . I know you can do it . But do n't talk about that . Please .
VOICE: I 'd rather see you remembered as the gallant gunman who tried to shoot his way past an army of police than as a coward who sucked the barrel . I 'm doing you PR for you . Creating a final image that 'll endure . The outraged New Yorker who was pushed too far . When some lowlife street person tries to invade his territory , he etaliated . And when the forces of the law closed in , he was defiant to the end .
STU: Like that nerdy sonofabitch who lew those three wiseass kids away on the subway ?
VOICE: Exactly . Nobody minded that he was a sicko . He was living out a New Yorker 's pet fantasy . Can you emember that movie where Pete Finch started screaming ' I 'm not taking it anymore ! ' And everybody picked up on it .
STU: ' I 'm mad as hell and I 'm not taking it anymore . '
VOICE: That was it . Poor Finch got himself an Oscar for that . But he was dead by then . I mean he really died . Maybe playing that part took too much out of him .
STU: ' I 'm not taking it anymore . ' ' I 'm not taking it anymore . '
VOICE: That 's the way ! Psyche yourself up . Everybody respects a man who fights back , even if he goes a little berserk in the process .
STU: Fighting back . That 's what it 's about .
VOICE: Exactly ! We all understand the poor schmuck that gets laid off and comes back and shoots all his osses . We all thought of doing that . But only he had the balls . The terminally ill husband who gets his policy canceled and machine guns the insurance company offices . Maybe somebody will finally get the message . You can fuck human beings over only for so long before they come back at you . I 'm still holding on Kelly and she looks very concerned . I could relieve all that anguish in a fraction of a second . Shall I ?
STU: I 'm on my knees begging you .
VOICE: Stand up , Stu . You 're embarrassing yourself .
VOICE: Stu I want you back on your feet facing me . So you can see what I 'm going to do to her .
VOICE: Be a man , Stuart . Do n't let them see you like this . You 're an embarrassment to me .
SERGEANT: Officer on east side of the street eports subject removed a dark metallic object from his pocket . We better move .
RAMEY: Hold all fire until you actually identify a weapon . We 're doing this on fucking TV !
EMERGENCY OPERATOR: Police . Is this an emergency ? Hello ? Is someone on the line ?
STU: You 've made your point . Who 's going to believe I 've got a snipe with a telescopic sight holding me in a fucking phone booth at 45th and 8th ?
VOICE: It took you a while to believe it yourself .
STU: If you 'd put a bullet in that Captain Ramey , it would 've been a different story but you were too wise to do that .
VOICE: Why do n't you do it for me ? Wave the old captain back over and get him nice and close and then use the handgun on him .
STU: Why me ? You could pick off any of those cops from your window up there . Like you did that pimp . And that tourist last week . But this time you want me to do you killing for you .
VOICE: And you will ! To save Kelly .
EMERGENCY OPERATOR: Can you speak up , sir ? What is your name ?
VOICE: That 's better , Stu . Now turn around so I can see you .
STU: This booth . It 's my whole world shrunk down to four feet by three feet . Not much bigger than the size of a coffin .
VOICE: They can put handles on the booth and bury you in it .
STU: When I saw you put that bullet into that black dude , I knew you 'd neve let me out of this phone booth alive .
VOICE: You 're wasting my time . Reach up and take the gun .
STU: Let me see you first . What harm can that do you ? You 're in one of those windows . I 've got to know which one .
VOICE: No need for that .
STU: Being so far , I could neve identify you . I do n't even want to .
VOICE: What is it then ?
STU: Do n't worry that I 'd try to point you out . You 'd shut me up with one of your .30 calibre hollow points efore I could even raise a finger .
VOICE: Why does it matter so much ?
STU: I want to see that you exist . Like God exists . It 's not enough to elieve . You want to see him just once even at a distance .
VOICE: And then you 'd take the gun down . And use it . We have a deal on that ?
STU: Show yourself to me and I 'll take the gun down . I swear . There 's a pause as the sniper mulls it over .
VOICE: I do n't have to make deals . And you 're irritating me by trying to negotiate . God does n't have to prove anything . He just strikes you down when he gets in the mood .
STU: Stop ! I wo n't ask to see you anymore .
VOICE: I 'm glad that 's settled . But look who else has showed up ?
STU: Who ?
VOICE: I guess she saw the coverage on TV and just could n't keep away .
STU: What are you talking about ?
VOICE: The 'hotel ' just arrived . And a very beautiful little hotel she is . Actually , I 'd classify her as more of a motel .
STU: Mavis ? I do n't see her .
VOICE: She 's too far back behind the police line . But I 've got a fine shot at her from up here .
STU: You do n't even know what she looks like .
VOICE: You 're in an enviable position now , Stu . You get to choose between them . Tell me which one .
STU: I ca n't .
VOICE: Which will it be ? Kelly or Mavis ? Or should I simply select one ?
STU: I need time to think
VOICE: You 've got to be more in touch with your feelings . You said you love Kelly .
STU: I do .
VOICE: Then I 'm doing you a favor putting you out of the way of temptation .
STU: It was n't Mavis ' fault . It was all my fault .
VOICE: Then take the third option . Reach above you and pick up the gun .
STU: You 'll leave them both alone ?
VOICE: There wo n't be much point in harming them without you around to impress .
STU: I 'll do it .
VOICE: Let me see you do it .
STU: I need one minute . One last minute , please . Can you give me that ?
VOICE: Do n't tell me you 're going to say your prayers ?
STU: Something like that .
RAMEY: They should 've traced the fucking call by now .
SERGEANT: There 's something else coming in . A 911 operator says your name was mentioned by somebody that 's still on the line . Somebody talking about a phone booth . And a sniper .
RAMEY: Patch me through . Hello , this is Captain Edward Ramey . What about that call ?
EMERGENCY OPERATOR: The line is still open . It 's originating from a booth at 45th and 8th .
RAMEY: We 're there ! Can you play me back your recording of the entire call ?
EMERGENCY OPERATOR: I ca n't replay the tape while it 's still running .
RAMEY: Then switch to another machine and play back what you 've got .
EMERGENCY OPERATOR: It 's awful faint . He 's not talking directly into the receiver .
STU'S VOICE: 'Who 's going to believe I 've got a sniper with a telescopic sight holding me in some fucking phone ooth '
TELEPHONE TECHNICIAN: Got what you wanted . The call 's coming from up the street . The Hotel Broadway .
RAMEY: Have you got the room ?
TELEPHONE TECHNICIAN: It 's not that easy . Electronic switchboard .
RAMEY: Move your SWAT units to the hotel . No wait . Any movement will alert the sniper . If he sees any of us withdraw , he may panic .
SERGEANT: There 's another SWAT unit on the way .
RAMEY: Intercept them . Divert them to the hotel .
SERGEANT: It 's done .
RAMEY: Send them in from the Forty-third Street side . I do n't want any activity the sniper might catch sight of . He 's probably high up and facing that booth . He 's got to continue to believe our full attention is focused on the man inside whoever the hell that poor bastard is . Hello 911 operator , I missed some of that . Run it halfway back and epeat it .
VOICE: The police seem all excited about something , Stu .
STU: Are they ? I was n't looking .
VOICE: I ca n't wait any longer . Say amen , then reach up for the gun . When your hand comes down , I want to see it .
STU: I 'm too afraid .
VOICE: For once , be brave . Surprise yourself .
STU: I 'm shaking all over .
VOICE: Guys in combat situations even shit their pants . But they follow orders .
STU: As soon as the cops see a gun , they 'll open fire .
VOICE: Then I 'd advise you to fire first .
POLICE SNIPER: Give me the word .
VOICE: Hard part 's over . Drop your arm and point it like you 'd point you finger and squeeze .
STU: No . You do it . If you want me dead , then fucking murder me !
VOICE: Why must I keep invoking some poo girl 's name every time we come to an impasse ? I 'm focused back on Kelly again . You 're obviously not willing to trade your life fo hers .
STU: I am ! I 'm doing it !
VOICE: Thanks for such an interesting afternoon .
RAMEY: Hello ? This is Captain Ramey . Somebody talk to me .
MEDIC: Do n't try to sit up .
STU: What was that ?
RAMEY: Rubber bullet .
MEDIC: You 'll have one hell of a nasty welt . Busted rib . Maybe a permanent scar there .
STU: It could n't hurt much more if you eally shot me .
RAMEY: Somebody was going to and we thought it may as well be us .
STU: Did you get him ?
RAMEY: Sure as hell did . Thanks to you .
STU: Still alive ?
RAMEY: Barely .
MEDIC: We 'll be giving him a hypo for the pain . It 'll put him out for a while .
STU: It 's okay . I 'm not really shot .
KELLY: I was so afraid . I thought
STU: I thought so , too . But we 're going to be alright . Both of us .
KELLY: Remember how you swore up and down you 'd get me on TV ? Well , you did . I already got interviewed on Fox and Channel Eleven and they even want me on A.M. America tomorrow morning .
STU: Bet you did n't think I could deliver on that .
MEDIC: Will you please let go of him , Miss ?
STU: No . No hypo . I want to see him first .
RAMEY: Relax . The guy 's dying .
STU: That 's why I 've got ta talk to him . Please !
RAMEY: We 'll see .
MEDIC: You can ride with him in the ambulance .
RAMEY: This is Ramey . Over . This is Ramey . Ten-Four .
COP'S VOICE: He 's not saying a word , Captain .
RAMEY: He 's not about to talk to us . Maybe to him .
STU: I can try .
RAMEY: Help him over here .
STU: It 's me . Do you hear me ? Answe me .
VOICE: Had to have the last word , Stu .
STU: I finally beat your ass . Admit it , you fuck .
VOICE: But you 'll never forget me . I gave you the most thrilling day of you life . Say thanks .
STU: Now you 're gon na die , you bastard .
VOICE: I lost a lot of blood . Do n't you want to donate some for me ? Then we 'd really be part of each other .
STU: Hang on . I ca n't wait to see you at the hospital . So I can yank your fucking air tube out .
VOICE: Wish I could give you that pleasure . You deserve it . Only I 'm out of time .
STU: What 's your name ? At least tell me who you are .
COP'S VOICE: He 's gone . Stu stares at the receiver .
RAMEY: Do n't worry . We 'll find out who he is . And why he picked you .
STU: No . You wo n't . What do you want to bet you wo n't ?
JENNA: Max , Max ! Can we do one ?
MOM: Jenna ! Jenna !
MAX: Oh , no .
JENNA: What 's three hundred and twenty-two times fou hundred and ninety-one .

MARCY DAWSON: Mr. Cohen . Marcy Dawson here again I was just looking over my schedule and I realized I 'll be in you neighborhood tomorrow around three . Max heads to the
MAX: Who is
MARCY DAWSON: Marcy Dawson from Lancet-Percy I 'm so anxious to meet you . It will be worth it—for both of us I promise . See you at your house at three , okay ?
MAX: My househow do
MARCY DAWSON: Oh , do n't worry , I got your address from Columbia . So three it is . Looking forward to it .
MAX: Damn .
S0L: Max ! How are you7
SOL: Stop thinking , Max , just feel . Use your intuition . It 's the only way to get into the flow . What did you think of Hamlet ?
MAX: I did n't get to it .
SOL: It 's been a month . You have n't taken a single break .
MAX: I 'm so close , Sol . I 'm so close but I just ca n't grab it .
SOL: Have you met the new fish my niece bought me ? I named her Icarus . After you . My renegade pupil . You fly too high , you 'll get burned .
MAX: We 'll see .
SOL: But life is n't just mathematics . I spent forty years looking for patterns in Pi , I found nothing .
MAX: You found things
SOL: I found things , but not a pattern .
LENNY MEYER: Hey , Max , how you doing ?
MAX: Oh , okay .
LENNY MEYER: Lenny Meyer . I 'll put it out . So , what do you do ?
MAX: Um , I work with computers math .
LENNY MEYER: Really ? What type of math ?
MAX: Number theory . Mostly esearch .
LENNY MEYER: Number theory ? No way , I work in theory , too . Not traditional , though I work with the Torah . Amazing .
MAX: Yeah
LENNY MEYER: Yeah . You know Hebrew is all numbers . It 's all math .
MAX: Hm .
LENNY MEYER: Here , lookthe ancient Jews used Hebrew as thei numerical system . Each letter is a number .
MAX: Kind of interesting .
LENNY MEYER: Yeah , like take the Hebrew word for , say , the Garden of Eden , Kadem . Kuf , Dalei MemKuf is a hundred . Daled , four Mem , forty . They equal one hundred and forty-four . Then take the tree of knowledgein the garden , Aat Ha Haim , it equals two hundred and thirty-three . Now you can take that number and
MAX: They 're Fibonacci numbers .
LENNY MEYER: Huh ?
MAX: The Fibonacci sequence . Italian mathematician , thirteenth century . If you divide a hundred and forty-four into two hundred and thirty-three , it approaches theta .
LENNY MEYER: Theta ?
MAX: The Greek symbol for the golden ratio . The golden spiral .
LENNY MEYER: You 're right , I never saw that before . That 's the series you find in nature . Like the face of a sunflower .
MAX: Wherever there 's spirals .
LENNY MEYER: You see , there 's math everywhere .
MAX: Math everywhere
MAX: What the
DISSOLVE TO: EXT . PLAYGROUND - DAY
MAX: Euclid crashed . I lost all my data , my hardware .
SOL: Your mainframe ?
MAX: Burnt
SOL: What happened ?
MAX: I do n't know , first I got these horrible picks . Then Euclid spits out some numbers . Never saw anything like it and then it fries . The whole machine just crashed .
SOL: You have a printout ?
MAX: Of ?
SOL: The picks , the number ?
MAX: I threw it out .
SOL: What was the number it spit out ?
MAX: I do n't know , just a long string of digits .
SOL: How many ?
MAX: I do n't know .
SOL: What was it , a hundred and fifty , a thousand , two hundred sixteen ! ? How many ?
MAX: I do n't know . Probably around two hundred . Why ?
SOL: I dealt with some bugs back in my Pi days . I was wondering if it was similar to one I ran into .
MAX: Yeah .
SOL: Remember Archimedes of Syracuse ? The King asks Archimedes to determine if a present he 's received was actually solid gold . Unsolved problem at the time . It tortures the great Greek mathematician for weeks . Insomnia haunts him and he twists and turns on his bed for nights on end . Finally , his equally exhausted wife , she 's forced to share a bed with this genius , convinces him to take a bath , to relax . While stepping into the tu he observes the bathwate ise as he enters . Displacement . A way to determine volume . And thus , a way to determine density , weight over volume . And thus , Archimedes solves the problem . He screams `` Eureka ! `` —Greek for `` I found it ! `` —and is so overwhelmed he uns dripping naked through the streets to the King 's castle to report his discovery . Now , what 's the moral of the story .
MAX: That a breakthrough will come
SOL: Wrong . The point of the story is the wife . Listen to your wife , she will give you perspective . Meaning , you need a break , Max , you have to take a bath , otherwise you 'll get nowhere . There will e no order , only chaos . Go home and take a bath .
MAX: Hey , excuse me , can I see that ?
MARCY DAWSON: Mr. Cohen ! Perfect timing .
MAX: Who are you ?
MARCY DAWSON: OhMarcy Dawson . From Lancet Percy . We were supposed to meet at three .
MAX: I 'm sorry , I do n't
MARCY DAWSON: I ca n't tell you what a pleasure it is to finally meet you . I 've studied your papers for years .
MAX: No , no , no , really , I ca n't .
MARCY DAWSON: We 're excited by your work . We ca n't wait to discuss
MAX: On the nose . On the damn nose .
MAX: Um , no , it 's Max from next door .
DEVI: Max , is everything all ight ?
MAX: Do you have any iodine ?
DEVI: Iodinedid you cut yourself ?
MAX: No . I just need it to stain a slide .
DEVI: Ah , science , the pursuit of knowledge . One second .
MAX: Just something with my computer .
MRS. OVADIA: Humph .
MAX: Just a printout . I , uh , lost my data
LENNY MEYER: Max ! How you doing ? Lenny Meyer .
MAX: Oh , hey
LENNY MEYER: Hey , where you going ? You got a few moments to do Tefillin ?
MAX: You got ta car ?
LENNY MEYER: Yeah , right there . That 's Ephraim , my friend .
MAX: All tight , lets go .
LENNY MEYER: Great
MAX: Lenny , I do n't really want to do
LENNY MEYER: Do it for me ? It means a lot , having someone of your stature performing a mitzvah in my presence . When you told me your name was Max Cohen , I did n't realize you were the Max Cohen . Maximilian Cohen .
MAX: You know me ?
LENNY MEYER: 0f course , I 've followed your research since your Columbia days . It 's evolutionary . You 've inspired the work we do .
MAX: I have ?
LENNY MEYER: Yes , very much so . The only difference is , we 're not looking at stocks . We 're searching for a pattern in Torah .
MAX: What kind of pattern ?
LENNY MEYER: We 're not really sure . Our calculations have shown us that there is a number encoded in the text .
MAX: What sort of number ?
LENNY MEYER: We do n't know . All we know is that it 's two hundred and sixteen digits long .
MAX: Two sixteen ?
LENNY MEYER: Yes . Now we have to say a small prayer , repeat after me .
MAX: What is it ?
LENNY MEYER: It 's a prayer about ou dedication to our one and only God .
MAX: No , I mean the number , the two sixteen number ? What is it ?
LENNY MEYER: Oh . We do n't know . We just know that it 's the most common number encoded in the text . It might be some type of linguistic pattern . If we could figure out what the number is we could maybe answer that .
MAX: Tell me more .
SOL: Max ?
MAX: What 's going on , Sol ! ?
SOL: Relax , it 's early .
MAX: What 's the two hundred and sixteen number , Sol ?
SOL: Excuse me ?
MAX: You asked me if I had seen a two hundred and sixteen digit number , right ?
SOL: Oh , you mean the bug . I found it working on Pi .
MAX: What do you mean by `` found it '' ?
SOL: What 's this all about , Max ?
MAX: Well , there 's these eligious Jews who have
SOL: Religious Jews ?
MAX: Well , you know , Hassidim . I met one in the coffee shop . The guy 's a number theorist . The Torah is their data set . The thing is , they 're searching for a two hundred and sixteen digit number in the Torah .
SOL: Really ? What 's it mean to them ?
MAX: They say they do n't know , but that 's crazy . I mean what are the odds
SOL: It 's just a coincidence .
MAX: But hold on , there 's something else . You remembe those strange picks I got .
SOL: Yesterday 's stock picks ?
MAX: Right . Well , it turns out that they were correct . I hit two picks on the nose . Smack on the nose .
SOL: Hmmm .
MAX: Something 's going on , and it has to do with that number . The answer is there .
SOL: Max , it 's a bug .
MAX: No . it 's a pattern . A pattern is in that numbe
SOL: Come with me .
MAX: But as a Go game progresses , the possibilities ecome smaller and smaller . The board does take on order . Soon , all moves are predictable .
SOL: So ?
MAX: So , maybe , even though we 're not sophisticated enough to be aware of it , there is an underlying ordera pattern , beneath every Go game . Maybe that pattern is like the pattern in the market , in the Torah . The two sixteen number .
SOL: That is insanity , Max .
MAX: Or maybe it 's genius . I have to get that number .
SOL: Hold on , you have to slow down . You 're losing it , you have to take a breath . Listen to yourself . You 're connecting a computer bug I had , a computer bug you might have had , and some religious hogwash . If you want to find the number two sixteen in the world , you 'll be able to pull it out of anywhere . Two hundred and sixteen steps from your street comer to your front door . Two hundred and sixteen seconds you spend iding on the elevator . When your mind becomes obsessed with anything , it will filte everything else out and find examples of that thing everywhere . Three hundred and twenty , four hundred and fifty , twenty-three . Whatever ! You 've chosen two sixteen and you 'll find it everywhere in nature . But Max , as soon as you discard scientific rigor , you are no longer a mathematician . You ecome a numerologist . What you need to do is take a eak from your research . You need it . You deserve it Here 's a hundred dollars , I want you to take it . If , you wo n't take it , borrow it . Either way , take a break . Spend it however you like as long as it falls in the category of vacation . Real world stuff , okay . No math . Max looks at his bands .
MARCY DAWSON: Mr. Cohen ? Mr. Cohen ? Please stop for a second Mr. Cohen ?
MAX: Damn it already ! Stop following me . I 'm not interested in your money . I 'm searching for a way to understand our world . I 'm searching for perfection . I do n't deal with mediocre materialistic people like you !
MARCY DAWSON: I 'm sorry . I 'm very sorry . I admit I 've been a bit too aggressive . But all I ask is for five minutes of your time . Here
MAX: Go .
MARCY DAWSON: Good . It 's funny , even though we have different aims and different goals we 're actually incredibly alike . We both seek the same thing—perfection . I know clearly we 're seeking different types of perfection , but that is what makes us perfect candidates for a fruitful partnership . If you let me , I can be you greatest ally . Take the acacia treein East Africa . It is the most prevalent plant in all of Kenya because it has managed to secure its niche by defeating its major predator , the giraffe . To accomplish this , the tree has made a contract with a highly specialized red ant . The tree has evolved giant spores which act as housing for the ants In return for shelter , the ants supply defense . When a giraffe starts to eat the tree 's leaves , the shaking anch acts like an alarm . The ants charge out and secrete an acid onto the giraffe 's tongue . The giraffe learns its lesson and never returns . Without each other , the tree would be picked dry and the ants would have no shade from the brutal African sun Both would die . But with each other , they succeed , they survive , they surpass . They have different aims , different goals but they work together . Max , we would like to establish a mutually benefiting alliance with you .
MAX: I 'm not interested .
MARCY DAWSON: Allow me to dose .
MAX: I told you I do n't want money .
MARCY DAWSON: The suitcase is n't filled with fifties or gold or diamonds . Just silicon . A Ming Mecca chip .
MAX: Ming Mecca . They 're not declassified .
MARCY DAWSON: You 're right . They 're not . But Lancet-Percy has many friends . Come here , take a look .
MAX: What dodo
MARCY DAWSON: Beautiful , is n't it ? You know how rareare you okay ?
MAX: Yeah , I got to go .
MARCY DAWSON: But what about
MAX: Let me think about it
MARCY DAWSON: What ? Mr . Cohen ! ?
MAX: Hey !
TRANSIT COP: Up , buddy Coney Island , last stop .

MARCY DAWSON: You tech guys . I think you know what we want .
MAX: No , I do n't .
MARCY DAWSON: C'mon , Mr. Cohen . We can work together We can both profit from this information . We both need each other to get it , so why not work with us ?
MAX: I do n't know if I 'll find anything useful .
MARCY DAWSON: We 're willing to take the risk .
MAX: Okay . First , I want you to call off the surveillance .
MARCY DAWSON: Done . Anything else ?
MAX: Yeah , I 'm a very private person . Knock on my door and leave the suitcase outside . I do n't want to talk to Anyone .
MARCY DAWSON: How do I know you 're home ?
MAX: I 'll knock back .
MARCY DAWSON: Fair enough .
LENNY MEYER: The Torah .
MAX: What is it ?
LENNY MEYER: In Hebrew characters and numbers .
MAX: No , what is it ? The two hundred and sixteen digits .
LENNY MEYER: I do n't know . If you get it , maybe we can figure it out . Can you really find it ?
MAX: If the number 's in there , I 'll find it .
FARROUHK: There you go , dork . Been thinking about my girlfriend . Have n't you ?

SOL: You 're early . I was just studying our What did you do to yourself ?
MAX: You lied to me .
SOL: I thought you were going to take a break .
MAX: You found the two sixteen number in Pi , did n't you ? You saw it .
SOL: You have it ?
MAX: It 's in my head !
SOL: Okay , sit down . Max does .
MAX: The computer becomes conscious ?
SOL: In some waysI guess
MAX: Studying the pattern made Euclid conscious of itself . Before it died it spit out the number That consciousness is the number .
SOL: No , Max , it 's only a nasty bug .
MAX: Stop ? How can I stop ? I 'm this close .
SOL: The bug does n't only destroy computers .
MAX: What are you saying ?
SOL: Look what it did to you computer . Look what it 's doing to you .
MAX: You were afraid of it . That 's why you quit .
SOL: Max , I got burnt .
MAX: C'mon , Sol .
SOL: It caused my stroke .
MAX: That 's bullshit . It 's math , numbers , ideas . Mathematicians are suppose to e out on the edge . You taught me that !
SOL: Max , there 's more than math ! There 's a whole world
MAX: That 's where discoveries happen . We have to go out there alone , all alone , no one can accompany us . We have to search the edge . We have to risk it all . But you ran from it . You 're a coward .
SOL: Max , it 's death !

MARCY DAWSON: You 're responsible for this .
MAX: I did n't do anything . I did n't play the market .
MARCY DAWSON: But we did .
MAX: How could you do that ?
MARCY DAWSON: You gave us faulty information . You gave us the carrot , the right picks , but then you only gave us part of the code .
MAX: You selfish , irresponsible cretins . How could you be so stupid ! ?
MARCY DAWSON: C'mon , Max . This is n't a game anymore . We 're playing on a global scale . We used your code . FoolishI admit . But we can fix things if we make some careful picks . Give us the rest of the code so we can set things right .
MAX: C'mon ! I know who you are . You 're not gon na save the world .
MARCY DAWSON: Look , Max
MAX: My God , what are you doing ?
MARCY DAWSON: Information is the private language of Capital . We tried to establish a symbiotic elationship but if you choose to compete and enter our niche we are forced to comply with the laws of nature .
MAX: You ca n't kill me !
MARCY DAWSON: C'mon , Max . You do n't get it . I do n't give a shit about you . I only care about what 's in you fucking head . If you wo n't help us help yourself , then I 'll have only one choice . Destroy the competition . I 'll take you out of the game . Survival of the fittest , Max . And we 've got the gun .
MAX: You bastards ! You stupid astards !
FARROUHK: He 's sick ! He 's sick !
LENNY MEYER: Max !

LENNY MEYER: Stay down !
MAX: Go back !
LENNY MEYER: He 's okay , he got in his cab . We 've been looking for you .
MAX: What 's going on ?
LENNY MEYER: Do you have the number ?
MAX: What 's going on ?
LENNY MEYER: Do you have the number ?
MAX: Yeah , I have it !
LENNY MEYER: You have it . Where is it ? You have it written down ?
MAX: What is it ?
LENNY MEYER: We 're not joking around , Max ? Where 's the number ?
MAX: It 's not on me . It 's in my head .
LENNY MEYER: You memorized it ? Did you give it to them ?
MAX: Who ?
LENNY MEYER: Who ! ? Those Wall Street bastards .
MAX: Why do you care ?
LENNY MEYER: Just answer me !
MAX: Screw you !
LENNY MEYER: Hit him !

RAV COHEN: Max , Max . You 're okay I 'm Rabbi Cohen . Cohen like you . I 'm sorry for what Lenny did , he 's been eprimanded . It is not our way Are you okay ?
MAX: Yeah , yeah
RAV COHEN: Everything will be fine , Max . You need to give us the number . Do you have it ?
MAX: What is it ?
LENNY MEYER: I told you we do n't know
MAX: You would n't be so flipped out if you did n't know . What 's happening to me ?
LENNY MEYER: Give us the number !
MAX: Screw you !
RAV COHEN: Okay , okay ! Lenny , easy ! Max , I 'll tell you what 's going on . Just calm down . The Talmud tells us it began two thousand years ago , when the Romans destroyed the second temple .
MAX: What are you
RAV COHEN: Just give me a chance . You 'll understand everything if you listen .
MAX: So ?
RAV COHEN: That word was the true name of God .
MAX: Yeah
RAV COHEN: The true name , which only the Cohanim knew , was two hundred and sixteen letters long . A long beat .
MAX: You 're telling me that the number in my head is the name of God ! ? Wondrously , Max rubs the scar on his head .
RAV COHEN: Yesit 's The key into the messianic age . As the Romans burned the temple , the Talmud says , the High Cohen walked into the flames . He took his secret to the top of the burning building . The heavens opened up and took the key from the priest 's outstretched hand . We 've been searching for the key eve since . And you may have found it . Now let us find out .
MAX: That 's what happened . I saw God .
RAV COHEN: No , no , Max . You 're not pure . You ca n't see God unless you 're pure .
MAX: It 's more than God it s everything . It 's math and science and nature the universe . I saw the Universe 's DNA
RAV COHEN: You saw nothing .
MAX: I saw everything .
RAV COHEN: There 's much more . We can unlock the door with the key . It will show God that we are pure again . He will return us to The Garden .
MAX: Garden ? You 're not pure . I 'm the one who has the numbe
RAV COHEN: Who do you think you are ? You are a vessel from our God . You are carrying a delivery that needs to be made to us .
MAX: It was given to me . It 's part of me . It 's changing me .
RAV COHEN: It 's killing you . Because you are impure .
LENNY MEYER: It will kill you !
MAX: And what will it do to you ?
LENNY MEYER: We 're pure . Give us the number !
MAX: The number is nothing . You know that !
RAV COHEN: We can use it . We can wield it .
MAX: It 's just a number . I 'm sure you 've written down every two hundred sixteen number . You 've translated all of them . You 've intoned them all . Have n't you ? But what 's it gotten you ? It 's not the number ! It 's the meaning . It 's the syntax . It 's what 's etween the numbers . If you could understand you would . But it 's not for you ! I 've got it . I understand it . I 'm going to see it ! RabbiI was chosen .
JENNY ROBESON: Can I help you ?
MAX: Sol ?
JENNY ROBESON: Were you a friend ?
MAX: What do you mean ?
JENNY ROBESON: He had a second stroke .
MAX: Where is he ?
MAX: Stop it , please !
DEVI: Breathe , Max ! Breathe . Focus . Max turns away from Devi and we return to the

JEHNA: Max , Max !
JENNA: Can we do one , Max , can we ? Max shrugs , not able to say no .
MAX: I do n't know . I really do n't know . What is it , Jenna ?
JENNA: Forty-six thousand six hundred and sixty-five .
MAX: Oh .
DOROTA: Mr. Szpilman .
SZPILMAN: Hello .
DOROTA: I came specially to meet you today . I love your playing , but what a day to choose .
SZPILMAN: Who are you ?
DOROTA: My name 's Dorota , I 'm Jurek 's sister . oh ! You 're bleeding .
SZPILMAN: It 's nothing .
JUREK: C'mon , Dorota , you can write him a fan letter later , this is n't the est time , c'mon .
SZPILMAN: Jurek , why have you been hiding her ?
FATHER: What you think , should I take Uncle Szymon 's photograph ?
MOTHER: Take it , do n't take it , take what you like . Ca n't you see I 'm worried sick ?
FATHER: He 'll come home , he 'll be all right .
REGINA: Mama , Wladek 's home . Mother dashes out of the kitchen .
MOTHER: Thank God - Wladek ! You 're wounded .
SZPILMAN: It 's a little cut , nothing .
MOTHER: I 've been worried sick .
HENRYK: I told her not to worry . You had your papers on you . If you 'd been hit by a bomb , they 'd have known where to take you . The girls suppress smiles .
MOTHER: Henryk , do n't say things like that , God forbid , God forbid .
HALINA: Papa , Wladek 's home .
FATHER: What did I tell you ?
SZPILMAN: What are you doing ?
REGINA: What 's it look like we 're doing ? The toing and froing continues non-stop .
SZPILMAN: They bombed us , we 're off the air .
HENRYK: Warsaw 's not the only radio station .
MOTHER: Pack , darling , get your things , pack .
SZPILMAN: Where are we going ?
MOTHER: Out of Warsaw .
SZPILMAN: Out of Warsaw . Where ?
REGINA: You have n't heard ?
SZPILMAN: Heard what ?
REGINA: Have n't you seen the paper ? Where 's the paper ?
HALINA: I used it for packing .
REGINA: She used it for packing .
FATHER: The government 's moved to Lublin .
HALINA: All able-bodied men must leave the city , go across the river and set up a new line of defence , that 's what it said .
FATHER: There 's hardly anybody left in this building , only women , the men have gone .
SZPILMAN: And what do you think you 'll do while you 're setting up a new line of defence ? Wander round lugging your suitcases ?
MOTHER: Pack , Wladek , there 's no time .
SZPILMAN: I 'm not going anywhere .
HALINA: Good ! I 'm not going anywhere either !
MOTHER: Do n't be ridiculous , we 've got to keep together .
SZPILMAN: No , no , no , I 'm staying put . If I 'm going to die , I prefer to die at home .
MOTHER: God forbid !
HENRYK: Sssh ! Crackles , whistles and static from the radio .
RADIO ANNOUNCER: an important announcement . News has just been received through the BBC that Great Britain , having had no reply and therefore has declared wa on Nazi Germany next few hours awaiting latest news Henryk hits the set .
HENRYK: Mama , that was a great dinner .
SZPILMAN: It certainly was .
MOTHER: When there 's something to celebrate , you 've got to make an effort . The glasses are handed round .
FATHER: Here 's to Great Britain and France . They all clink glasses and drink .
MOTHER: Is that all ?
FATHER: Yes , five thousand and three zlotys , that 's all we 've got left .
REGINA: It 's three thousand and three zlotys too much , 'Re Further restrictions regarding liquid assets Jews will be allowed to keep a maximum of two thousand zlotys in their homes . '
MOTHER: What are we supposed to do with the rest ?
HALINA: Deposit it in a bank . Blocked account .
HENRYK: Banks ? Who 'd be stupid enough to deposit money in a German bank ?
REGINA: We could hide the money here in the window frame .
FATHER: No , no , no . I 'll tell you what we 'll do . We 'll use tried and tested methods . You know what we did in the last war ? We made a hole in the table leg and we hid the money in there .
HENRYK: And suppose they take the table away ?
MOTHER: What d'you mean , take the table away ?
HENRYK: The Germans go into Jewish homes and they just take what they want , furniture , valuables , anything .
MOTHER: Do they ?
FATHER: Idiot ! What would they want with a table ?
MOTHER: What on earth are you doing ?
HALINA: There 's a good place under the cupboard .
HENRYK: No , no . Listen , I 've been thinking
SZPILMAN: That makes a change .
HENRYK: You know what we do ? We use psychology .
SZPILMAN: We use what ?
HENRYK: We leave the money and the watch on the table . And we cover it like this . In full view . The Germans will search high and low , I promise you , they 'll never notice it .
SZPILMAN: Of course they 'll notice it . But look This is a good place for something .
HENRYK: A good place for what ? He 's insane !
SZPILMAN: Just shut up .
FATHER: My violin ? They all talk at once .
REGINA: Quiet ! Quiet ! Order , please , order !
HALINA: She 's a lawyer , she likes order .
REGINA: Listen , just listen . Let 's come to an agreement . We jam the money in the window frame . The watch we hide under the cupboard . And the chain we put in the violin . A brief silence .
FATHER: Will I still be able to play ?
SZPILMAN: Let 's find out . They start to hide the things .
JUREK: Wladek ! How are you ?
SZPILMAN: Fine , we 're fine , thank you , and you ?
JUREK: Fine , we 're fine in the circumstances . But I can guess what you 've called about . There 's nothing we can do ; they wo n't reopen the station
SZPILMAN: Yes , I know , but Jurek , Jurek
JUREK: not even music , nothing , no adios for the Poles . But I 'm sure you 'll find work , Wladek , a pianist like you .
SZPILMAN: Maybe , maybe not , but , Jurek , do n't e offended , I did n't call to discuss my future career .
DOROTA: I nagged Jurek for weeks and weeks . And at last he gave in and said , 'All right , come with me tomorrow , ' and so I came and they bombed the station .
SZPILMAN: You know something ? Meeting you like that was absolutely wonderful .
DOROTA: Really ?
SZPILMAN: Yes ! It wasit was unforgettable . She 's embarrassed .
DOROTA: I 've always loved your playing , Mr. Szpilman .
SZPILMAN: Wladek , please .
DOROTA: No one plays Chopin like you . She begins to laugh .
SZPILMAN: I could accompany you , me on the piano , you on the cello .
DOROTA: Oh , Mr Szpilman , you 're quite quite wonderful .
SZPILMAN: Wladek , please .
FATHER: 'Re emblems for Jews in the Warsaw District . I hereby order that all Jews in the Warsaw District will wear visible emblems when out of doors . This decree will come into force on the 1st December 1939 and applies to all Jews over twelve years of age . The emblem will e worn on the right sleeve and will represent a blue Star of David on a white background . The ackground must be sufficiently large for the Star to measure eight centimetres from point to point . The width of the arms of the Sta must be one centimetre . Jews who do not respect this decree will be severely punished . Governor of Warsaw District , Dr . Fischer . ' Silence . Then
HENRYK: I wo n't wear it .
REGINA: wo n't wear it . I 'm not going to be anded .
SZPILMAN: Let me see this .
FATHER: Does n't it say we have to provide these armbands ourselves ? Where will we get them ?
HENRYK: We 're not going to get them . We 're not going to wear them ! Silence , each locked in their own thoughts .
GERMAN OFFICER: You !
FATHER: I 'm sorry I
GERMAN OFFICER: You are forbidden to walk on the pavement . Walk in the gutter !
HALINA: Have you seen this ?
SZPILMAN: What , I 'm working , what ?
SZPILMAN'S VOICE: What is it ?
HALINA'S VOICE: That 's where they 're going to put us .
SZPILMAN'S VOICE: What d'you mean , put us ?
HALINA: 'By order of the Governor of the Warsaw District , Dr. Fischer , concerning the establishment of the Jewish District in Warsaw . There will be created a Jewish District in which all Jews living in Warsaw or moving to Warsaw will have to reside . '' And look here 'Jews living outside of the prescribed area will have to move to the Jewish district by 31st of October 1940 . ' Szpilman gazes at the map , horrified .
SZPILMAN: Butthey wo n't get all of us we'llit 's too smallthere 's four hundred thousand of us in Warsaw !
HENRYK: No . Three hundred and sixty thousand , so it 'll be easy .
HALINA: Mama , what is it ?
MOTHER: Twenty zlotys . That 's all we 've got left . What can I buy with twenty zlotys ? I 'm sick of cooking potatoes , potatoes , potatoes .
MR LIPA: That 's the price . That 's what I 'm offering . And my advice is to accept . You wo n't get more from anyone else .
REGINA: Butbut it 's a Steinway , M Lipa
MR LIPA: Two thousand . My advice is to take it . What you going to do when you 're hungry ? Eat the piano ?
HENRYK: Get out ! You 're a thieving bastard , we do n't want your money , get out ! We 'd rather give it away ! Get out ! Regina tries physically to restrain him .
MR LIPA: Hey ! Hey ! What 's the matter with you ? Have n't you eaten today , what you suffering from ? Hey !
REGINA: Henryk , stop it , leave him alone .
MR LIPA: You people are crazy ! I 'm doing you a favour , two thousand , and I 'm paying for the removal , I 'm not even charging for the removal . Henryk subsides , glowering at him .
SZPILMAN: Take it .
DOROTA: I did n't want to come , I did n't want to see all this , but I could n't stop myself .
SZPILMAN: How are you doing ?
DOROTA: Fine , no , not really , they arrested my cousin , but Jurek says they 'll let him out . This is disgraceful .
SZPILMAN: Do n't worry , it wo n't last long .
DOROTA: That 's what I said , it 's so - it 's too absurd !
SZPILMAN: I 'll see yousoon .
FATHER: To tell you the truth , I thought it would be worse .
SZPILMAN: How will we sleep ?
MOTHER: I 'll sleep with the girls in the kitchen . You , Henrykc and Papa in here .
HALINA: Look ! Come and look ! They all go to the window and look out . Their POV - the street .
SZPILMAN: You sell anything ?
HENRYK: Just one . Dostoevsky . The Idiot . Three zlotys .
SZPILMAN: That 's better than yesterday .
HENRYK: Three lousy zlotys . And there are people here making millions .
SZPILMAN: I know .
HENRYK: You do n't know , believe me . They ibe the guards . The guards turn a blind eye . They 're bringing in cartloads , food , tobacco , liquor , French cosmetics , and the poor are dying all around them and they do n't give a damn .
SZPILMAN: I 'm afraid not .
HENRYK: Sometimes I wish I could go mad .
SOLDIERS: Faster ! Go on , faster ! Dance !
MOTHER: Good , they 're here . Yitzchak Heller 's been waiting for you , Henryk .
HENRYK: What 's this about ?
MOTHER: Sit down , have tea , I 'll start lunch when the girls get back .
HENRYK: So , what are you doing here ?
FATHER: He brought cakes . Awkward silence .
HELLER: We 're recruiting .
HENRYK: Who 's recruiting ?
HELLER: Do n't be clever with me , Henryk . I 've come here as a friend . They 're inging Jews in from all over the country . Soon there 'll be half a million people in the ghetto . We need more Jewish police
HENRYK: Oh ? More Jewish police ? You mean you want me to wear a cap like yours , beat up Jews with my truncheon and catch the Gestapo spirit . I see !
HELLER: Someone 's got to do it , Henryk .
HENRYK: But why me ? I thought you only ecruited boys with rich fathers . Look at my father , look at us , I mean
HELLER: Yes , I 'm looking at you and that 's why I 'm here . Your whole family can have a better life . You want to go on struggling for survival , selling books on the street ?
HENRYK: Yes , please .
HELLER: I 'm doing you people a favour . And what about you , Wladek ? You 're a great pianist . And we 've got an excellent police jazz band . They 'd welcome you with open arms . Join us . You 've got no work
SZPILMAN: Thank you . But I 've got work . Silence . Heller rises angrily .
BENEK: I 'm sorry , Mr Wladek , he wants you to stop .
SZPILMAN: Who wants me to stop ?
2ND CHILD: Help me ! help me !
JEHUDA: I always say look on the bright side . You 're in the small ghetto , intellectuals , professional people , you 're better off than us . Here , in the large ghetto , it 's a cesspool . But you , you 're living in Monte Carlo . You could say you 're privileged and that , of course , goes against my principles . Nevertheless
SZPILMAN: You 're amazing , Jehuda .
JEHUDA: No , I 'm a socialist . I have brothers everywhere . They bring me news and food . We care about our fellow human beings . Workers of the world unite .
SZPILMAN: So , what 's the news ?
JEHUDA: The Germans are advancing on Kharkhov .
SZPILMAN: I do n't know why I come here every evening , it 's always such bad news .
JEHUDA: Bad news , you crazy ? You have no world view , Wladek , that 's you trouble . The news could n't be etter . The moment Hitler invaded Russia , I knew we 'd be all right . Remember Napoleon . Same business . The Germans will freeze to death , please God .
SZPILMAN: Jehuda , give me something to do .
JEHUDA: You 're an artist , Wladek , you keep people 's spirits up . You do enough .
SZPILMAN: But I want to help , I want to .
JEHUDA: You 're too well known , Wladek . And you know what ? You musicians do n't make good conspirators . You 're tootoo musical . He loves this , laughs , coughs .
SZPILMAN: There are notices going up . The city 's to be cleansed of undesirables .
JEHUDA: There are always notices going up .
MAJOREK: Hello , Symche , Dolek , Mrs Zyskind , Jehuda . Working hard ? He stops , seeing Szpilman .
JEHUDA: Majorek , this is the greatest pianist in Poland , maybe in the whole world . Wladyslaw Szpilman . Meet Majorek .
MAJOREK: I know your name . I 've never heard you play .
JEHUDA: Majorek used to be in the army . Brilliant man . He 's got a mind like a searchlight . The only thing I 've got against him is he 's not a socialist . You 'd better go now , Wladek . It 's nearly curfew . You see these , Wladek ? You know how many copies we print of ou newspaper ? Szpilman shrugs .
SZPILMAN: Toilets ?
MAJOREK: As many toilets as I can find . Germans never go into Jewish toilets . They 're too clean fo them .
MOTHER: And , please , tonight , for once , I do n't want anything bad talked about . Let 's enjoy our meal .
HENRYK: Okay , then I 'll tell you something funny . You know who I mean by Dr. Raszeja .
REGINA: The surgeon ?
HENRYK: The surgeon . Well , for some reason , do n't ask me why , the Germans allowed him into the ghetto to perform an operation
HALINA: On a Jew ? They allowed a Pole to come in to operate on a Jew ?
HENRYK: He got a pass , that 's all I know . Anyway , he puts the patient to sleep and starts the operation . He 'd just made the first incision when the SS burst in , shoot the patient lying on the table , and then shoot Dr. Raszeja and everybody else who was there . Is n't that a laugh ? The patient did n't feel a thing , he was anaesthetised - He laughs . No one else does .
MOTHER: Henryk , I said nothing bad .
HENRYK: What 's the matter with you all ? Have you lost your sense of humour ?
SZPILMAN: It 's not funny .
HENRYK: Well , you know what 's funny ? You 're funny with that ridiculous tie .
SZPILMAN: What are you talking about , my tie ? What 's my tie got to do with anything ? I need the tie for my work .
MOTHER: Boys , boys
HENRYK: Your work , yes , playing the piano for all the parasites in the ghetto , they do n't give a damn about people 's sufferings , they do n't even notice what 's going on around them !
FATHER: I blame the Americans . The others look at him .
SZPILMAN: For what ? For my tie ?
FATHER: American Jews , and there 's lots of them , what have they done for us ? What do they think they 're doing ? People here are dying , have n't got a bite to eat . The Jewish bankers over there should be persuading America to declare war on Germany !
NCO: Stand up !
REGINA: Be quiet , Mama , for God 's sake , be quiet !
SZPILMAN: What 's happened ?
HALINA: Oh my God , it 's terrible , you 've got to do something , oh my God !
SZPILMAN: Calm down , what , what is it ?
HALINA: They 're hunting people on the streets . They 've picked up Henryk .
SZPILMAN: I 'm afraid not . He tries to dodge past but she grabs his arm .
HELLER: I have n't seen him .
SZPILMAN: Believe me , they 've picked him up .
HELLER: Tough luck .
SZPILMAN: Can you help ?
HELLER: Oh , you need me now , yes , now you need me !
SZPILMAN: Can you help us ?
HELLER: It costs .
SZPILMAN: I 've no money .
HELLER: Then there 's nothing I can do . He should 've joined us when I gave him the chance..
SZPILMAN: Yitzchak , they told me you had influence .
HELLER: Who told you ?
SZPILMAN: People I know . They said you 're an important man .
POOR WOMAN: A snatcher ! Help me , a snatcher !
RUBINSTEIN'S VOICE: Boys , keep your peckers up ! And girls , keep your legs crossed !
RUBINSTEIN: Do n't let 'em get you down - He approaches a couple of Shupos .
1ST SHUPO: Good day , Herr Rubinstein .
RUBINSTEIN: If that means good day , I 'm you man , you gangsters , robbers , pirates !
2ND SHUPO: Mad !
RUBINSTEIN: Ich bin meshuge , you bandit !
HENRYK: You go to Heller , did I ask you to talk to him ?
SZPILMAN: You 're out , are n't you ? They start to walk .
HENRYK: Did you beg , did you grovel to that piece of shit , that cockroach ?
SZPILMAN: I did n't grovel , I asked him to help .
HENRYK: What did you pay him ?
SZPILMAN: Pay him ? With what ? With what could I pay him ? Every zloty I earn we spend on food !
HENRYK: I can look after myself !
SZPILMAN: They were taking you away .
HENRYK: It 's nothing to do with you . It 's me they wanted , not you . Why do you interfere in other people 's usiness ?
SZPILMAN: You 're mad , that 's your trouble , you 're mad .
HENRYK: That 's also my business . They walk on .
SZPILMAN: What 's the matter ? Are you sick ?
HENRYK: Hungry .
SZPILMAN: What 's that mean , no employment certificate ?
HENRYK: You have to have an employment certificate to work for one of the German firms in the ghetto , otherwise
SZPILMAN: Otherwise what ?
HENRYK: You 'll be deported .
BENEK: So the rumours were true
HENRYK: They 're going to resettle us . Send us to labour camps . In the east . And they 're closing the small ghetto . Silence .
JEHUDA: Wladek ! Szpilman stops .
SZPILMAN: Not this week .
JEHUDA: I have to say you look terrible . What 's the trouble ?
SZPILMAN: You 've heard the rumours they 're going to resettle us in the East ?
JEHUDA: Rumours , rumours , you take it all too much to heart , Wladek .
SZPILMAN: I 've been trying to get a certificate of employment for my father . I 've managed to get certificates for me and the rest of the family but I need one more for my father . I 've been trying all the firms , the shops
JEHUDA: Why did n't you come to me ?
SZPILMAN: I did n't know you were in the certificate business .
JEHUDA: I 'm not , but Majorek is .
SZPILMAN: Can you help ? I 've no money
JEHUDA: Please , do n't insult us . Can you do something for him ?
MAJOREK: Be at the Schultz Workshop , tomorrow , four o'clock .
JEHUDA: You see what a wonderful piece of luck you 've had today ? That 's die historical imperative in action and that 's why I always say , look on
SZPILMAN: the bright side , yes , I know .
FATHER: Thank you .
SCHULTZ: My pleasure . It wo n't help you anyway .
FATHER: At least we 've got work in the ghetto . At least we 're still together .
NCO: Out ! Assemble in the yard !
SZPILMAN: We 're employed here , we 've got certificates -
NCO: The rest of you get dressed then eport back here . Bring you elongings . Fifteen kilos only .
SZPILMAN: I 'm sorry , I did my best , I thought the certificates would save us all .
MOTHER: Stop it , Wladek .
REGINA: Let 's just hope that Henryk and Halina will be better off -
SZPILMAN: Let 's sit over there .
FATHER: I can hear you . Szpilman goes to them .
DR. EHRLICH: We 're letting them take us to ou death like sheep to the slaughter !
FATHER: Dr. Ehrlich , not so loud !
DR. EHRLICH: Why do n't we attack them ? There 's half a million of us , we could eak out of the ghetto . At least we could die honourably , not as a stain on the face of history ! Another man , Grun , joins in .
GRUN: Why you so sure they 're sending us to our death ?
DR. EHRLICH: I 'm not sure . You know why I 'm not sure ? Because they did n't tell me . But I 'm telling you they plan to wipe us all out !
FATHER: Dr. Ehrlich , what do you want me to do ? You want me to fight ?
GRUN: To fight you need organisation , plans , guns !
FATHER: He 's right . What d'you think I can do ? Fight them with my violin bow ?
GRUN: The Germans would never squander a huge labour force like this . They 're sending us to a labour camp .
DR. EHRLICH: Oh , sure . Look at that cripple , look at those old people , the children , they 're going to work ? Look at Mr Szpilman here , he 's going to carry iron girders on his ack ?
MOTHER: Henryk !
REGINA: Oh my God !
MOTHER: Halina ! Henryk !
HALINA: We heard you were herewedid n't wantwewe wanted to be with you .
SZPILMAN: Stupid , stupid !
HALINA: She 's getting on my nerves . What did she do , for God 's sake ? Grun leans across to her .
GRUN: She smothered her baby . Halina looks at him in disbelief .
SZPILMAN: What are you reading ?
HENRYK: 'If you prick us , do we not bleed ? If you tickle us , do we not laugh ? If you poison us , do we not die ? And if you wrong us , shall we not evenge ? '
SZPILMAN: Very appropriate .
HENRYK: Yes , that 's why I brought it . Later
FATHER: How much for a caramel ?
SZPILMAN: Halina ?
HALINA: What ?
SZPILMAN: Funny time to say this .
HALINA: What ?
SZPILMAN: wish I knew you better .
HALINA: Thanks .
A VOICE: Szpilman ! Szpilman !
SZPILMAN: Papa !
HELLER: What do you think you 're doing , Szpilman ? I 've saved your life ! Now , go on , save yourself !
JEWISH POLICEMAN: Well , off they go for meltdown !
BENEK: Why are you here , Mr. Wladek ?
SZPILMAN: It 's like this Iweall of them . He ca n't continue . Benek nods .
BENEK: Perhaps they 're lucky . The quicke the better . It is n't over yet . We 'll stay here for a couple of days . Until things die down . I 've bribed a policeman . He 'll come when it 's over .

BARTCZAK: I 'll see if I can get him something etter .
WORKER: Trouble .
SS CAPTAIN: I have important and good news fo you . There are rumours circulating that resettlement measures are again going to be taken . A glance between Szpilman and Majorek .
MAJOREK: The smaller one . At the bottom .
SZPILMAN: Majorek ! Majorek is instantly awake .
MAJOREK: It 's easy to get out , it 's how you survive on the other side that 's hard .
SZPILMAN: I know . But last summer , I worked for a day in Zelazna Brama Square . I saw someone I knew . A singer . Her husband 's an actor . They 're old friends . I 've written their names down . And their address . If they 're still there . Janina Godlewska and Andrzej Bogucki . Good people . Majorek , you go into the town every day . Would you try and make contact ? Ask them if they 'd help me get out of here ?
SS LIEUTENANT: Any fucking plaster ?
SZPILMAN: We 're allowed to take food into the ghetto . Five kilos of potatoes and a
SS LIEUTENANT: Open it .
SZPILMAN: It 's only potatoes and bread .
SS LIEUTENANT: Fuck that , you 're lying , I can smell it . Open it .
MAJOREK: I tried your friends . They 're not at that address any more . But .
SZPILMAN: You made contact ?
MAJOREK: Be ready to leave in two days ' time . Same place as last night .
SZPILMAN: Oh , shit !
ALL WORKERS: Hey , ranks unite And follow the White Eagle ! Stand up and fight Our mortal enemy . Riflemen , hey ! Let 's give them fire and brimstone . We 'll blow away The yoke of slavery . Punish and rout The rapists of our nation . We 'll smash the knout To save our dignity . Soon we 'll be proud Of our liberation -
GERMAN VOICES: Get on with it and fall in ! Fall in !
BOGUCKI: We have n't much time .
SZPILMAN: Thank you , I do n't .
BOGUCKI: You 'll be looked after by M Gebczynski . He 's on the other side of town . You 'll stay there tonight . Then we 'll find you somewhere else . Janina adds the last strip of clothing .
JANINA: I 'll bring you food .
BOGUCKI: Let 's go .
GEBCZYNSKI: I 'll show you where you 're going to sleep .
SZPILMAN: I 'll be fine .
GEBCZYNSKI: You 'll have to stay here until tomorrow afternoon . He helps Szpilman into the compartment .
GEBCZYNSKI: Must feel better this side of the wall .
SZPILMAN: Yes , but sometimes I 'm still not sure which side of the wall I 'm on .
GEBCZYNSKI: Here . He leads Szpilman to the small kitchen .
KITTEN'S VOICE: Puppydog , what d'you mean , you forgot ?
PUPPYDOG'S VOICE: What d'you think I mean , Kitten ? I forgot , that 's what I mean .

JANINA: wanted to come earlier but She hands him the parcel .
SZPILMAN: Thank you .
JANINA: No one thought they 'd hold out so long .

JANINA: Wladek , stop that . It 's over now . Just be proud it happened . My God , did they put up a fight .
SZPILMAN: Yes , so did the Germans .
JANINA: They 're in shock . They did n't expect it . Nobody expected it . Jews fighting back ? Who 'd have thought ?
SZPILMAN: Yes , but what good did it do ?
JANINA: What good ? Wladek , I 'm surprised at you . They died with dignity , that 's what good it did . And you know something else ? Now the Poles will rise . We 're ready . We 'll fight , too . You 'll see . she turns to look again out of the window .
GEBCZYNSKI: Get your things together , you have to leave !
SZPILMAN: What 's happened ?
GEBCZYNSKI: I 'm on the run !
SZPILMAN: What 's happened ?
GEBCZYNSKI: The Gestapo found our weapons . They 've arrested Janina and Andrzej . They 're bound to find out about this place , too - you must get away at once .
SZPILMAN: Where do you want me to go ? Look at me . No , no , I 'm not leaving . Ca n't I take my chances here ?
GEBCZYNSKI: That 's your decision . But when they storm the flat , throw yourself out of die window - do n't let them get you alive . I have poison on me , they wo n't get me alive either !
KITTY'S VOICE: Open this door at once , or we 'll call the police !
KITTY: Are you from the flat in there ? You 're not registered .
SZPILMAN: It belongs to a friend of mine . I came to visit but I must have just missed him .
KITTY: Have you got your identity card ? Let me see your identity card ! Szpilman hesitates ; she shouts more loudly .
WOMAN'S VOICE: Yes ?
SZPILMAN: Mr Gebczynski sent me .

SZPILMAN: When 's your baby due ?
DOROTA: Christmas . This is not a good time to have children . But then
MICHAL: Oh , yes . I remember . He shakes hands with Szpilman .
SZPILMAN: Mr Gebczynski said to contact you only in an emergency , but
MICHAL: Do n't worry now . We ca n't move you tonight .
SZPILMAN: Excuse me , could I have a piece of ead ?
MICHAL: Yes , of course , we 'll eat .

MICHAL: This is Antek Szalas . Szalas and Szpilman shake hands .
SZALAS: You do n't remember me , Mr. Szpilman ?
SZPILMAN: No , I do n't think so ?
SZALAS: Warsaw Radio . I was a technician . I saw you almost every day .
SZPILMAN: Sorry , I do n't remember .
SZALAS: Does n't matter . You 've nothing to worry about . I 'll visit often .
MICHAL: And you 'll be pleased to hear the Allies are bombing Germany night after night - Cologne , Hamburg , Berlin .
SZALAS: And the Russians are really giving them hell . It 's the beginning of the end . He gives the others their vodka .
MICHAL: Let 's hope so . I do n't know when I 'll see you again ? They clink glasses and drink .
SZALAS: Still alive then , are you ? Here . Sausage . Bread .
SZPILMAN: How long is this meant to last ?
SZALAS: You do n't want to worry about that . My grandfather was jilted by his girl friend when he got jaundice . In my opinion , jaundice is not very serious . Drink up .
SZPILMAN: Why did n't you come sooner ? It 's een over two weeks . Szalas goes to the window , looks out .
SZALAS: Problems . Money . I 've got to raise money to buy the food . I need things to sell , it ' s not easy .

DOROTA: Wladek ? Wladek ! I knew it , I knew this would happen !
MICHAL: You ca n't , it 's too dangerous .

DOROTA: We came to say goodbye . We 're going to stay with my mother in Otwock.The aby 's already there . It 's safer . There 's talk that the uprising will begin any day now . Szpilman suddenly winces with pain .
DOCTOR: Acute inflammation of the gall ladder . Liver the size of a football . But he 'll live . I 'll try to get hold of some levulose , but it 's not easy .
DOROTA: Can you visit him again ?
DOCTOR: Who knows ?
SZPILMAN: Doctor , thank you .
DOCTOR: Do n't speak . Rest .

But so passionate was their singing that they did not notice , no did they stop as the rain began to fall and when their voices ose for the final bars of the duet a great bolt of lightening came out of the sky and struck my father so that he lit up like a torch And at the same moment my father was struck dead my mother was struck dumb ! She- never-spoke-another-word .
AUNT MORAG: Ohhh dear . Not another word From the shock , yes it would e .

SAUL: Somebody killed a cop , a lady and a guy ?
DALE: No ! A guy !
SAUL: A cop killed a guy ?
DALE: No ! A cop and a guy killed another guy ! The lady and the guyNo , a fucking woman , a police woman , and an old guy , shot a guy , a younger guy , in the fucking window at Ted 's house !
SAUL: Was the guy Ted ?
DALE: Which guy ?
SAUL: I do n't know , the old guy who shot the guy ?
DALE: I do n't fucking know . He was this big , old , grey haired guy with a gun , and he fucking took him , and he shot him ! Right there in the fucking window ! BAM !
SAUL: I heard Ted 's got grey hair !
DALE: And they saw me ! They saw me see them shoot the guy !
SAUL: What ! ? ! They saw you ? ! ? Why the fuck did you come here ? Did they follow you ? ! ?
DALE: No ! I panicked . I was having a coughing fit , I crashed , I crashed into a car . Fuck , two cars . They must 've heard at least . They knew someone was there .
SAUL: But they do n't know it 's you ?
DALE: No . I do n't think so . No .
SAUL: Sothey 're not coming here ?
DALE: I 'm not calling the cops - one of them was a cop . They could all be cops !
SAUL: Did you see any blood ? Was it sick ?
DALE: Yeah . I saw some blood .
SAUL: I wonder who the guy he shot was ?
DALE: I do n't know , who do drug dealers kill ? It was probably another drug dealer . He was Asian . Are there Asian drug dealers .
SAUL: Hell yeah , man . The Koreans teamed up with , like , the Vietnamese or some shit . They 're crazy mother fuckers . Number two in town . Heh . Ted 's cappin ' the competition . Yo , you want some of this ?
DALE: I 'm sitting across from Ted 's smoking a massive joint of that weed you sold me-
SAUL: Oh , the Pineapple Express . It 's so rare it 's almost a shame to smoke it , like killing a unicornwith , like , a bomb .
DALE: When I threw itoutthe window
SAUL: What ?
DALE: This weed is actually that rare ?
SAUL: Yeah , it 's like , `` the rarest '' .
DALE: So , you are actually the only guy in town with this weed ?
SAUL: Fuckin ' rights , I am . Red told me he was giving me an `` exclusive sneak preview '' .
DALE: And am I the only guy you gave it to ?
SAUL: Yeah . So , we 're the only guys .
DALE: But , like , another dealer , could n't identify it , the pineapple weed ? Like , if they found a roach of it , right ?
SAUL: I could . Why ?
DALE: We should go , we should n't be here ! We should go !
SAUL: Noseriously , why ?
DALE: I left a roach of this weed in front of Ted 's house !
SAUL: So what ? I leave roaches all over fucking town .
DALE: No , listen - they could find the roach and say , `` This is pineapple weed , Saul 's the only guy in town who has pineapple weed , therefore he must have witnessed the murder or know who did - let 's go kill him . ''
SAUL: Mother of fuck !
DALE: Wait !
SAUL: Why ! ? ! Let go of me ! Let 's get the fuck out of here !
DALE: Saul , wait ! Grab anything we might need , like your weed and money and stuff .
SAUL: Yes ! Come on !
DALE: We 'll take the stairs , it 'll be faster .
SAUL: Why ? ! ?
DALE: We do n't want to draw attention .
SAUL: Whose attention ! ? ! You think they could e down there ? In the Lobby ? Right now ! ? !
DALE: I do n't know ! Who knows ? Just try to be cool .
SAUL: What the fuck was that ?
DALE: That was bad - Calm ! Calm ! Calm !
MATHESON: Look .
BUDLOFSKY: Ted ? He 's gone , but he was just here . I think he knew we were coming .
DALE: Okay , what do you know about Ted ?
SAUL: What ? Ted ? Nothing . For all I know he 's tracking us with space satellites right now ! He 's got grey hair , that 's all I knew .
DALE: No way ! What if they did see my license plate ! ? !
SAUL: Okay , so let 's got to a hotel , or a motel , or a Holiday Inn .
DALE: Well , how much money do we have ?
SAUL: All I 've got is the seventy-five you gave me .
DALE: That 's it ! ? !
SAUL: Well , how much money do you have ?
DALE: Uhnine bucks .
SAUL: Well , shut up then ! I 've got more than you !
DALE: Fine . Forget the hotel .
SAUL: I wish we could just go nowhere .
DALE: Okaywhere 's nowhere ?
SAUL: He could n't . Cause I 'm in the woods . It 's impossible ! Unless he 's , like , hanging on the bottom of the car or some shit , but I mean-
DALE: No , what I mean is , if Ted found the oach and identified the weed , how could he connect it to you ?
SAUL: There 's no way . He could only find out from Red .
DALE: Who is this Red guy ?
SAUL: Red 's pretty much a middleman between Ted and guys like me . And we 're mad fucking tight . One time he convinced some girl he knew to give me a hand-job within , like , five minutes of me meeting her .
DALE: But let 's say someone calls asking who he sold this pineapple weed to , he 'll say you , becausewhy would n't he ?
SAUL: Fuck that . That 's bullshit . He would have called me if that happened . A hand-job , Dale ! Imagine if I 'd gotten you a hand job by now !
DALE: Yeah , but Saul , he 's a fucking drug dealer .
SAUL: So ? I 'm a fuckin ' drug dealer . What , you do n't trust me then ?
DALE: UmIcall him . Yeah , sure , call him .
SAUL: Thank you !
DALE: You 're right . You are . I 'm just being paranoid . Sorry , dude .
SAUL: Yo , Red . You okay man ?
DALE: No ! We should do it tomorrow !
SAUL: I 'm in the middle of a convo , man . Let 's just go and get this shit over with .
DALE: Come on , man . Tomorrow . I 'm scared shitless . I want to think things through efore I do anything . Let 's go in the morning . Please .
SAUL: Yeahokay . Less scary shit happens in the day .
BUDLOFSKY: Why is n't he coming now ? What did you say ?
RED: I did n't say shit , man ! There was anothe guy there and he said tomorrow !
MATHESON: Why did he mention the casino ? The Asians un the casinos . Is Saul Asian ?
RED: No , man !
MATHESON: This might be more than we thought .
BUDLOFSKY: Than you thought . I thought it would be more than you did . I 'll call Ted .
SAUL: I always liked smoking weed in the forest .
DALE: I 'm going to go call Angie . Make up some ull shit .
SAUL: Dalewait !
DALE: What the fuck is that ? !
SAUL: It 's them ! ! !
DALE: You know what ? You 're right . We should just get rid of them . We should just smash ` em .
SAUL: No ! Smash it !
DALE: What the fuck was that ? !
SAUL: Fuck ! I was trying to throw it at that tree !
DALE: What tree ?
SAUL: That one .
DALE: Who the fuck knows ? ! ? I do n't know ! ! Why could n't you have just smashed it on a ock like a normal person ?
SAUL: I was trying to smash it ! How often does a guy smash things ? I 'm rusty . Fuck .
DALE: Did you at least see where it landed ?
SAUL: Over there , somewhere . Wait ! We could call it !
DALE: With what ? I just smashed my phone !
SAUL: Man , it 's not like they got McGuyve workin ' on the case . I bet they ca n't even triangulate it .
DALE: Well , then you should n't have said anything , cause now you 've convinced me that they can !
SAUL: Fine ! Fine . Let 's just find the stupid thing and get back to doing what we were doin ' .
DALE: Do you see it ?
SAUL: Dude , this is the scariest place I 've ever been in my life .
DALE: The `` Blair Witch Project . ''
SAUL: NoShit . That one 's way scarier than the one I was thinking of . Mine had Arnold Shwartzenegger in it . Now I 'm thinking of the fucking Blair Witch .
DALE: Stop !
SAUL: What-
DALE: Sshh !
SAUL: What is-
DALE: Sshh ! Can you hear that ?
SAUL: What ?
DALE: Just listen .

SAUL: I do n't know ! I 'm freaking out , man ! Let 's just go !
DALE: No ! We 're not going anywhere !
SAUL: But there could be something out there !
DALE: There 's nothing out there , that 's why we 're here . God , man , you scared the fucking shit out of me .
SAUL: Well , I 'm not getting out of the car . I 'm staying in the car .

RED: Who 's this guy ?
DALE: Dale . Nice to meet you .
RED: Dale who ?
DALE: I think it 's better if you do n't know my last-
SAUL: Dale Denton . He 's with me . No worries .
RED: What happened to your clothes ? Where 'd you call me from , man ?
SAUL: We were in the forest laying low . Thinking .

DALE: How many cops does he have in hisuh , payroll , or whatever ?
RED: I know there 's this lady cop . He could have more , I do n't know . He 's got pretty crazy connections . He 's also got a cool- ass hideout . It 's crazy man .
DALE: Who 's his competition ?

MATHESON: You hear that ?
TED: Ask if either of them were Asian .
MATHESON: Hey . What skin color were these guys ?

TED: Fuck .
CAROL: Does he have something to do with ou friend in there ?
TED: If the Asians have the balls to send an assassin right into my home , we ca n't be too cautious . The boys say Denton and Saul are Caucasian . Maybe after thei assassin failed , they hired this outside guy Denton to finish the job . Also , the boys said that Saul mentioned `` going to the casino . ''
CAROL: `` Going to the casino '' ? I do n't like that .
SAUL: But my parents live in Canada . You do n't think they 're going to go to Canada , do you ? How would they get a Canadian phone ook even ?
DALE: All I know is Angie 's new number is on my fridge and they could see that , so I have to get to her .
SAUL: My Grandma lives here . They would n't go after her , would they ? She 's got a different last name . Belogus .
ANSWERING MACHINE: `` cough It 's Dale . I 'm probably at work , maybe we 'll talk later . BEEP ``
MATHESON: Budlofsky !

ROBERT: Get the hell out of my house .
DALE: Okay , Mr. Anderson , look , here 's the deal - I saw a crooked cop kill a guy while I was workingthis morning . The cop shot the guy then saw my car drive off , and I think they might have seen my license plate and , so , I ditched my carin the woods , so
SAUL: No fucking way .
ANGIE: Who are these people ? Why are they-
DALE: I think their drug dealers .
ANGIE: Why ?
DALE: Well , it 's complicated . See , theuhit does n't matter right now , we just have to get out of here .
ANGIE: Let 's go to the police !
DALE: No , they are the police !

ROBERT: Baby ! Get in the car quick . Angie , in the car !
ANGIE: Dale - get in the car !
ROBERT: You stay the fuck away from my family !
ANGIE: Shut up dad !
DALE: II think it would be best if I did n't go with you . I do n't want to put you in any more danger .
ANGIE: What are you going to do ? What should we do ?
ROBERT: Angie , get in the car !
DALE: Alright , baby . Here 's the plan - go to the Holiday Inn downtown and use a fake name . Something like Carlyle .
ANGIE: Carlyle ? II have so many questions . I justhow can this be happening ? Wherewhere are you going ?
DALE: I have to stop this . I do n't know how , ut do n't worry . I 'll keep you safe . But still , watch your back . You neve know where they might be , whoever they are .
ANGIE: Uhthanks .
DALE: Umyou 're welcome . And nice to meet you guys .
SAUL: Why are n't we in that car ?
DALE: Let 's run , man ! Run !
SAUL: Huff Huff Where are we running ?
DALE: Somewhere we can think .
CAROL: A fork ?
TED: A bloody fork . In his girlfriends house . And the blood was fresh .
CAROL: Maybe he killed her , to protect himself .
TED: Or maybe it 's the Asians fucking with us . What the fuck is going on ! Any luck with the cell phones ?
CAROL: They smashed one and left the other one in the woods to distract us . Took us an hour to find it . And we found Denton 's car , which was filled with all these strange disguises . These guys are fo eal .
TED: I want to talk to the Asians . Get me Cheung 's number . Now .
CHEUNG: Hello ?
TED: Cheung . It 's Ted .
CHEUNG: Record this conversation .
TED: Cheung , I want you to call off your man Denton . I do n't know what he is , a scout , assassin , and frankly I do n't care . I just want him gone . I want him dead . If you do this , I 'll consider it a peace offering , otherwise , you 're asking fo war . And just in case you forgot , I 'm number one , and there 's a reason fo that . You 've got 24 hours to reply .
CHEUNG: Ted Jones is slipping . Our assassin failed to kill him , but it did rattle his confidence . It 's earlier than planned , ut we should strike now , while he is confused . Let it be known-
SAUL: Victory joint complete . Here ya go .
DALE: `` Tell us what you know ! '' How fuckin ' alls was that ?
SAUL: Like , really balls .
DALE: And I think I fought pretty well , do n't you ? You know , for my first time . We were like Tango and Cash , man .
SAUL: Or Scarface !
DALE: BOOM ! Knocked the door right off it 's hinges !
SAUL: And you probably saved Angie , which is fucking pimp .
DALE: I probably could n't have done it without you . Thanks , man . It is fucking pimp .
SAUL: We 're in this together , right ? So , ya know .
DALE: Thanks , man . You know , my last dealer was a total dick . You 're by far the coolest deale I 've ever had .
SAUL: Wow . Thanks , man . I seriously appreciate that .
DALE: Yeahlike , the time before last time , I totally had weed . I just kind of wanted to chill with you .
SAUL: Really ? That 's awesome , man . That means a lot to me , ` cause , like , plenty of dudes come in to buy and pretend to be all uddy-buddy with me , but in my head I 'm always , like , `` you do n't like me , you like my drugs , so fuck you , buddy ! '' You know ? And just so you know , I totally could have lit that cross-joint on my own . I 'd just have to use candles , but , like , I 've never smoked one of those with anyone before .
DALE: So , do you think we should leave town ? We could just get on a bus and go , right ?
SAUL: We only have , like , fifty bucks . I do n't think that could even pay for one ticket .
DALE: What about your sack ?
SAUL: Oh man . It 's still fucking killing me .
DALE: No dude , your sack of weed . Ca n't we sell some ?
SAUL: Of course . That 's my bread and butter . We just have to go to a highschool . It 's the easiest market . Chester A. Arthur is like , a block a way .
DALE: No way , man . I 'm not going to sell to kids .
SAUL: Why ? They 're gon na get it from somewhere . I mean , we got it from guys like us .
DALE: Well , then not kids at that school .
SAUL: Well , there 's a bunch of private ones nearby , but they 're into way crazier shit than weed-
DALE: I ca n't do it , man . I 'm not going to a high school is there anywhere else we could go ?
SAUL: We could go to Crackhead Park .
DALE: What 's that ?
SAUL: It 's a park . Really close , actually . Full of crackheads . They smoke weed too , though .
DALE: Fuck this place .
SAUL: Yo . ` sup . You guys want some chronic ?
DALE: Man , this is great .

DALE: Could I have the , uh , Carlyle room , please ?
ANGIE: Dale ?
DALE: Angie ! Thank god you 're okay !
ANGIE: I 'm fine . How are you ? Are you okay ?
DALE: I 'm great . I 'm fine . I miss you . So , here 's the plan , babe . I 'm going to leave town and contact a government official o something . From somewhere safe . I know this shit is all fucked up and I just ca n't apologize enough .
ANGIE: Dale . I 've realized some problems and-
DALE: I know there 's a problem ! That 's the thing , that 's why I-
ANGIE: Dale , shut up and listen . People are trying to kill you , and me ! Dale , drug dealers are trying to kill me , because of you ! It 's fucking over , man . Are you kidding me ? For gods sake
DALE: Angie , no ! No ! Do n't you get it ? I was thrown into this situation , I had no control , but I am dealing with it . This kind of thing happens , you know-
ANGIE: NO ! IT DOESN '' T ! You 're immature , Dale ! I 'm six years younger and I 'm saying this ! And the fact that you think you 're some kind of fucking genius just makes it a hundred times more infuriating !
DALE: What ? You 're telling me you think I 'm a dumb guy ?
ANGIE: You 're not how you think you are Dale , and it 's pathetic . Call me when I can go home .
SAUL: Alrghit , I 'll see you soon . And I 'm sorry again about the clocks . Ha ! What a douche bag . Yeah , love you too .
DALE: Are you joking ? You 're actually gon na smoke marijuana ?
SAUL: Why not ?
DALE: How can you smoke marijuana after what we just went through ? That clearly happened ecause we were smoking marijuana .
SAUL: No . It happened because those fucking kids did n't keep that shit on the down low . Which is weird , ` cause they really seemed like cool kids .
DALE: If you have n't noticed , we 're not very functional when we 're stoned , Saul .
SAUL: When I saved you with those Slurpees I was stoned . What do you got ta say to that ? Maybe the pot is what gave me the creative capacity to come up with such a great plan ! The Beatles were high !
DALE: You did n't save me ! She was going to protect us , and now we 're wanted for all sorts of crazy shit !
SAUL: For one thing , I 'm done dealing pot . Mostly , because I do n't know where I would get it now , but still . And `` b '' , fuck you , man . You ca n't judge me . We 're exactly the same , and this whole thing 's your fucking fault . You 're the one who dropped the roach !
DALE: It 's not my fault !
SAUL: Stop calling it marijuana !
DALE: Grow up , you fucking two year old .
SAUL: See ! This is why you 're a douche bag , Denton . Because you think you 're bette than others , but you 're just a dum pothead burnout , same as me .
DALE: Maybe I am a pothead burnout , but at least I 'm not the dumbest most annoying guy in the world . The only reason I eve ought weed from you was because you 're shit is so good , not because you 're cool .
SAUL: But you said you bought when you already had a few times , just to hang out ?
DALE: Bullshit ! I just likeliked having lots of different kinds of weed at once .
SAUL: Here . Buy yourself a good last meal .
DALE: Saul ! I 'm sorry , man ! I did n't mean all that ! Saul !
CAROL: Guy drove like a mother-fucker . It was amazing .
TED: This is not good . We should have this under control . We have n't heard shit from the Asians . Got these lunatics after us . Shit .

DALE: Iwhat ? I 'm not here to fight , man , I-
RED: Good , man . I 'm fuckin ' tired .
DALE: Go to the hospital , man ! Are you crazy . You do n't have to die .
RED: Yes I do ! What ? I go to the hospital , I 'm gon na end up in But that does n't matte ` cause once Ted finds out , which he will , I 'm dead wherever I am . I 'm fucked through and through . Now if you 'd be willing to give a dying man his wish , could ya run on into the other room and pop in disc two of Tu Pacs `` All Eyez On Me '' . I want to listen to it while I die .
DALE: You do n't have to die .
RED: Will you stop saying that , I 've excepted it , man . I 'm at peace . cough
DALE: Red , I need you to tell me where Ted 's ase is . He took Saul , and I ca n't bail on him . I 'm going to get him back .
RED: Fuckin eh , amigo .
DALE: What are you doing ?
RED: So , this is the backside of the farm . If you stay low in the grass you should be fine . If someone is shooting at you with an automatic weapon , zig zag . It makes you harder to hit .
DALE: You 're not coming to help ?
RED: Fuck no ! I 've been shot . By these guys . I was in shock before , but the air on the drive cleared my mind , I should get to the hospital . You saw Reservoir Dogs , ight ? I got shot in the best spot possible . I could have a long and fruitful life ahead of me . Full of possibilities . Go get ` em , slugger .
DALE: But how do I get out of here if I rescue Saul ?
RED: I 've no idea . I 'm sure it wo n't be that hard . Kill some dude and take his car , o just take it or whatever . Good luck , amigo !
DALE: I 'll blow his fuckin ' brains out if you don't-
THUG 2: What the fuck was that , Budlofsky ?
BUDLOFSKY: Have n't you seen `` Speed '' ? `` Shoot the hostage '' .
THUG 2: In the leg , you fucking moron !

BUDLOFSKY: What ?
DALE: I had to try .
SAUL: Dale ! ? ! What the fuck ? Did you rat me out , you shitty bastard ? That what happened ?
DALE: No ! I came here to save you !
SAUL: To save me ? Ha ! That 's rich ! You 're caught , too . And now I have to die with some asshole .
DALE: Saul , I deserved that , because I fucked you . You 're right , this whole things my fault , and they only way I can make it up to you is by rescuing you , and that 's why I 'm here . To save my friend .
SAUL: Tell ya what , Dale . You actually save me and I 'll consider forgiving you for this mad shit .
DALE: Good . ` Cause I will .
SAUL: Oh really ? What , you forget to tell me you shoot lasers out of your eyes , or you got some kind of secret blowtorch strapped to your dick ? We 're not gon na escape , Dale , we 're losers , and sinners , and after we die , we 're gon na go to hell !
DALE: We 're not losers ! We did that car chase . That was all you , man ! You got away from the cops . I 've watched , like , nine illion hours of worlds wildest police chases and I 've never seen a guy get away . Not once ! But you did it . You did the impossible .
MATHESON: We can hear you out there , and it 's annoying . Shut the fuck up .
DALE: Perfect ! Now rub your wrists against my elt ! My belt buckle 'll cut the tape . Do it ! This is it !
TED: You have them ?
BUDLOFSKY: Got them downstairs .
CAROL: Where did you find them ?
BUDLOFSKY: We found Saul at his grandmother 's and Dale Denton busted in here like a madman , armed to the teeth , and-
TED: He shot Frank ? Jesus . Fuckin ' Frank .
CAROL: Who the fuck is this Dale Denton ?
TED: Well , we 'll torture these two bastards and find out everything they know . What about the shipment ? Ready to move out ?
BUDLOFSKY: We 'll be good to in 10 minutes or so .
DALE: This is n't working . Turn around . I 'm using my mouth .
SAUL: Someone 's coming !
DALE: Yo - if I cough , I 'm going to make a move , if I cough twice , you take the lead . Got it ?
SAUL: What ? No ! What if you actually cough ?
MATHESON: Hey man , whatever you 're doing , I get it , okay ? So just stop it , alright ? Just cut it-
SAUL: Holy shit , man ! I 'm sorry !
TED: Has anyone seen my bigger knife ? Do you guys hear that ?

DALE: I do n't know ! That guy just blew half my fucking ear off !
SAUL: There 's some dudes in here . I saw them when I got dragged down . And there 's some kind of super-suit or something .
DALE: Were they armed ?

SAUL: Tell her you cut off your ear for her , like that crazy artist . But , seriously dude , your joking right ? She 'll never take you back , ever . Just grow up and date a woman your own age .
DALE: Do you think we should have looked fo the ear ? They probably could 've re- attached it , eh ? I mean , this ear thing kind of fucking sucks .
RED: Oh my god , they blew your ear off , man ! Fuck that 's gross . Can you dudes switch sides ? I do n't want to look at it .
SAUL: Do n't worry , man . Look at Evande Holyfield , he looks totally normal . And plus , I saw this thing on the Discovery Channel , they can actually grow ears , like , in a petri dish , or even on the side of a mouse . And you only need half of one . It 'll be a fuckin ' cinch .

ELIZABETH: drink up me hearties , yo , ho
GIBBS: Quiet , missy ! Cursed pirates sail these waters . You want to call 'em down on us ? Elizabeth stares wide-eyed at him .
NORRINGTON: Mr. Gibbs .
GIBBS: She was singing about pirates . Bad luck to sing about pirates , with us mired in this unnatural fog mark my words .
NORRINGTON: Consider them marked . On you way .
GIBBS: 'Aye , Captain . Bad luck to have a woman on board , too . Even a mini'ture one .
ELIZABETH: I think it would be rathe exciting to meet a pirate .
NORRINGTON: Think again , Miss Swan . Vile and dissolute creatures , the lot of them . I intend to see to it that any man who sails under a pirate flag , or wears a pirates brand , gets what he deserves a short drop and a sudden stop .
SWAN: Captain Norrington I appreciate your fervor , but I am concerned about the effect this subject will have on my daughter .
NORRINGTON: My apologies , Governor .
ELIZABETH: Actually , I find it all fascinating .
ELIZABETH: Yes , father .
NORRINGTON: Man overboard !
ELIZABETH: Boy overboard !
NORRINGTON: Fetch a hook ! Haul him out of there !
GIBBS: Mary mother of God Attention is turned away from the boy
SWAN: What happened here ?
NORRINGTON: An explosion in the powder magazine . Merchant vessels run heavily armed .
GIBBS: Lot of good it did them Everyone 's thinking it ! I 'm just saying it ! Pirates !
SWAN: There is no proof of that . It could have been an accident . Captain , these men were protection . If there is even the slightest chance one of those poo devils is still alive , we can not abandon them !
NORRINGTON: Of course not , Governor . Come about and strike the sails ! Unlash the boats ! Gunnery crew jackets off the cannons ! Hope for the bestprepare fo the worst . Move the boy aft . We 'll need the deck clear .
SWAN: Elizabeth , I want you to accompany the boy . He 's in your charge now . You 'll watch over him ?
ELIZABETH: My name is Elizabeth Swann .
WILL: Will Turner .
ELIZABETH: I 'm watching over you , Will . He clutches her hands , then slips back into unconsciousness .
NORRINGTON: Did he speak ?
ELIZABETH: His name is Will Turner that 's all I found out .
NORRINGTON: Very good .
ELIZABETH: Yes yes .
SWANN: Still abed at this hour ? It 's a eautiful day !
SWANN: Is an occasion necessary for a fathe to dote upon his daughter with gifts ?
ELIZABETH: I knew it .
SWANN: Or , rather , Commodore Norringtona fine gentleman , do n't you think ? He fancies you , you know . Behind the screen , Elizabeth GASPS .
ELIZABETH: Difficult to say .
BUTLER: Governor ? A caller is here fo you .
SWANN: Ah , Mr. Turner ! It 's good to see you again !
WILL: Good day , sir . I have your order .
SWANN: Impressive . .. very impressive . Commodore Norrington will be pleased , I 'm sure . Do pass my compliments on to your master .
WILL: I shall . A craftsman is always pleased to hear his work is appreciated
SWANN: Elizabeth ! You look stunning !
ELIZABETH: Will ! It 's so good to see you !
SWANN: Elizabeth , this is hardly appropriate -
ELIZABETH: About the day we met . Do you emember ?
WILL: I could never forget it , Miss Swann .
ELIZABETH: Will , how many times must I ask you to call me 'Elizabeth ' ?
WILL: At least once more , Miss Swann . As always .
SWANN: Well said ! There 's a boy who understands propriety . Now , we must be going .
ELIZABETH: Good day , Mr. Turner .
WILL: Good day .
SWANN: Dear , I do hope you demonstrate a bit more decorum in front of Commodore Norrington . After all , it is only
HARBORMASTER: If you 're out rolling scuppers in this tub , you 're either incredibly ave or incredibly stupid .
JACK: It 's remarkable how often those two traits coincide .
HARBORMASTER: It 's a shilling for the dock space , and you 're going to have to give me your name .
JACK: What do you say to three shillings , and we forget the name ?
HARBORMASTER: Welcome to Port Royal , Mr. Smith .
MURTOGG: This dock is off-limits to civilians .
JACK: Sorry , I did n't know .
MURTOGG: No someone has to make sure this dock stays off-limits to civilians .
JACK: This must be some important boat .
MULLROY: Ship .
JACK: Ship .
MURTOGG: Captain Norrington 's made it his flagship . He 'll use it to hunt down the last dregs of piracy on the Spanish Lake .
MULLROY: Commodore .
MURTOGG: Right . Commodore Norrington .
JACK: That 's a fine goal , I 'm sure But it seems to me a ship like that makes this one here just a wee superfluous .
MURTOGG: Oh , the Dauntless is the power in these waters , true enough but there 's no ship that can match the Interceptor for speed .
JACK: That so ? I 've heard of one , supposed to e fast , nigh uncatchable the Black Pearl ? Mullroy scoffs at the name .
MULLR0Y: There 's no real ship as can match the Interceptor .
MURTOGG: The Black Pearl is a real ship .
MULLROY: No , it 's not .
MURTOGG: Yes it is . I 've seen it .
MULLR0Y: You 've seen it ?
MURTOGG: Yes .
MULLROY: You 've seen the Black Pearl ?
MURTOGG: Yes .
MURTOGG: Yes , I have .
MULLR0Y: You 've seen a ship with black sails that 's crewed by the damned and captained by a man so evil that hell itself spat him back out ?
MURTOGG: No .
MULLROY: No .
MURTOGG: But I 've seen a ship with black sails .
MULLR0Y: Oh , and no ship that 's not crewed by the damned and captained by a man so evil hell itself spat him back out could possibly have black sails and therefore could n't possibly be any ship other than the Black Pearl . Is that what you 're saying ?
MURTOGG: no .
MULLR0Y: Like I said , there 's no real ship as can match Hey !
JACK: I 'm sorry . It 's just such a pretty oat . Ship . The sailors study him suspiciously .
MURTOGG: What 's your name ?
JACK: Smith .
MULLR0Y: What 's your business in Port Royal , 'Mr . Smith ' ?
MURTOGG: And no lies !
JACK: None ? Very well . You 've rumbled me . I confess I intend to commandeer one of these ships , pick up a crew in Tortuga , and go out on the account , do a little honest pirating .
MURTOGG: I said , no lies .
MULLR0Y: I think he 's telling the truth .
MURTOGG: He 's not telling the truth .
MULLROY: He may be .
MURTOGG: If he were telling the truth he would n't have told us .
JACK: Unless , of course , he knew you would n't elieve the truth if he told it to you . Murtogg and Mullroy consider that point
NORRINGTON: May I have a moment ?
ELIZABETH: I ca n't breathe .
GILLETTE: The rocks , sir ! It 's a miracle she missed them !
JACK: Are n't you going to save her ?
MULLR0Y: I ca n't swim . Murtogg shakes his head neither does he .
JACK: Sailors .
MULLROY: Not breathing .
MULLROY: I never would have thought of that .
JACK: Clearly , you 've never been to Singapore .
NORRINGTON: On your feet .
SWANN: Elizabeth ! Are you all right ?
ELIZABETH: Yes yes , I 'm fine Commodore Norrington , do you intend to kill my rescuer ?
NORRINGTON: I believe thanks are in order .
JACK: Captain Jack Sparrow . If you please . Norrington looks out at the bay .
NORRINGTON: I do n't see your ship Captain .
MURTOGG: He said he 'd come to commandeer one .
MULLROY: I told you he was telling the truth . These are his , sir .
NORRINGTON: Extra powder , but no additional shot .
JACK: Ah , but you have heard of me .
NORRINGTON: Carefully , lieutenant .
ELIZABETH: Commodore , I must protest . Pirate o not , this man saved my life .
NORRINGTON: One good deed is not enough to redeem a man of a lifetime of wickedness .
JACK: But it seems to be enough to condemn him .
NORRINGTON: Indeed .
JACK: Finally .
ELIZABETH: You are despicable .
JACK: I saved your life ; now you 've saved mine . We 're square .
NORRINGTON: On his heels ! Gillette , bring a squad down from the fort !
ELIZABETH: Yes , I 'm all right , I 'm fine ! Go capture him .
SWANN: Here , dear you should wear this .
ELIZABETH: Thank you , Father and let that e the last of your fashion advice , please . But she accepts his comforting embrace .
WILL: Right where I left you .
JACK: You look familiar Have I eve threatened you before ?
WILL: I 've made a point of avoiding familiarity with pirates .
JACK: Ah . Then it would be a shame to put a black mark on your record . So if you 'll excuse me
WILL: You threatened Miss Swann .
JACK: Only a little .
WILL: I do . And I practice with them . At least three hours a day .
JACK: You need to find yourself a girl . Or maybe the reason you practice three hours a day is you 've found one but ca n't get her ?
WILL: No . I practice three hours a day so that when I meet a pirate I can kill him .
WILL: No .
JACK: Move !
WILL: No . I can not just step aside and let you escape .
JACK: You 're lucky , boy this shot 's not meant for you .
NORRINGTON: Excellent work , Mister Brown . You 've aided in the capture of a dangerous fugitive .
BROWN: Just doing my civic duty .
NORRINGTON: I believe you will always remembe this as the day Captain Jack Sparrow almost escaped .
BROWN: That ratter broke my bottle .
ELIZABETH: Nice and toasty . Thank you , Estrellia .
PRISONER: Come here , boy Want a nice , juicy bone ?
JACK: You can keep doing that forever , that dog 's never going to move .
PRISONER: Excuse us if we ai n't resigned ourselves to the gallows just yet .
SWANN: Has my daughter given you an answer yet ?
NORRINGTON: No . She has n't .
SWANN: Well , she had a taxing day Ghastly weather tonight .
NORRINGTON: Bleak . Very bleak . From the distance , there is a BOOM -
SWANN: What was that ?
NORRINGTON: Cannon fire !
JACK: I know those guns !
PRISONER: The Black Pearl ? I 've heard stories she 's been preying on ships and settlements for near ten years and never leaves any survivors .
JACK: There are a lot of stories about the Black Pearl .
NORRINGTON: Governor ! Barricade yourself in my office ! That 's an order !
ESTRELLA: Miss Elizabeth ?
ELIZABETH: Listen , Estrella they have n't seen you . Hide , and first chance , un for the fort .
SMOLDERING PIRATE: To blazes with the code !
PRISIONER: Praise be ! He and the other two scramble through .
JACK: It 's all right , doggie come here , oy . Come here , Spot . Rover . Fido ?
TWIGG: This is n't the armory . He turns to go , but Koehler has spotted Jack .
KOEHLER: Well , well Look what we have here , Twigg . It 's . Captain Sparrow .
TWIGG: Huh . Last time I saw you , you were all alone on a God-forsaken island , shrinking into the distance . I 'd heard you 'd gotten off , but I did n't believe it .
KOEHLER: Did you sprout little wings and flyaway ?
TWIGG: His fortunes are n't improved much .
JACK: Worry about your own fortunes . The lowest circle of hell is reserved for betrayers and mutineers .
KOEHLER: You know nothing of hell . And then they 're gone .
BOSUN: I did n't know we was taking captives .
ELIZABETH: I am here to The Bosun SLAPS her .
BOSUN: You 'll speak when spoken to !
BARBOSSA: And you 'll not lay a hand on those under the protection of parlay !
BOSUN: Aye , sir .
ELIZABETH: Captain Barbossa I have come to negotiate the cessation of hostilities against Port Royal . Barbossa is both impressed and amused .
BARBOSSA: There was a lot of long words in there , miss , and we 're not but humble pirates . What is it you want ?
ELIZABETH: I want you to leave . And neve come back . Barbossa and the pirates laugh .
BARBOSSA: I am disinclined to acquiesce to your request . Means ' No . '
ELIZABETH: Very well .
BARBOSSA: My holds are bursting with swag . That bit of shine matters to me Why ?
ELIZABETH: Because it 's what you 're searching for . You 've been searching for it for years . I recognize this ship .
BARBOSSA: Did you , now ?
ELIZABETH: Fine . I suppose if this is worthless , there 's no reason to keep it . She flips the medallion up , off her finger -
BARBOSSA: NO !
ELIZABETH: Elizabeth - Turner . I 'm a maid in the governor 's household . Barbossa reacts to the name Turner it confirms what he has suspected . The other pirates surreptitiously exchange glances and nods .
BARBOSSA: You 've got sand , for a maid .
ELIZABETH: Thank you , sir .
ELIZABETH: Of course . I did n't steal it , if that 's what you mean .
BARBOSSA: No , no , nothing like that . Very well . You hand that over , we 'll put your town to our rudde and ne'er return .
ELIZABETH: Can I trust you ?
BARBOSSA: It 's you who invoked the parlay ! Believe me , Miss , you 'd best hand it over , now or these be the last friendly words you 'll hear !
ELIZABETH: Our bargain . . ?
BOSUN: Still the guns , and stow 'em ! Signal the men , set the flags , and make good to clear port !
ELIZABETH: Wait ! You must return me to shore ! According to the rules of the Order of the Brethren -
BARBOSSA: First . Your return to shore was not part of our negotiations no our agreement , and so I 'must ' do nothing . Secondly you must be a pirate for the pirate 's code to apply . And you 're not . And thirdly
WILL: Miss Swann ! Elizabeth !
NORRINGTON: We 're aware of the situation .
WILL: We have to hunt them down and save her ! Swann 's worry has made him short-tempered .
SWANN: Where do you propose we start ? If you have any information that concerns my daughter , then share it ! If anyone does , tell me ! Leave , Mr. Turner .
MURTOGG: That Jack Sparrow he talked about the Black Pearl .
MULLROY: Mentioned it , is more what he did .
MURTOGG: Still
WILL: We can ask him where it is maybe he can lead us to it !
WILL: We could strike a bargain -
NORRINGTON: No . The pirates who invaded this fort left Sparrow locked in his cell . Ergo , he is not their ally , and therefore of no value . We will determine their most likely course , and launch a search mission that sails with the tide .
WILL: That 's not good enough . This is Elizabeth 's life !
NORRINGTON: Mr. Turner , this is not the time for rash actions . Do not make the mistake of thinking you are the only man here who loves Elizabeth . Now , go home .
WILL: Are you familiar with that ship ? The Black Pearl ?
JACK: Somewhat .
WILL: Where does it make berth ?
JACK: Surely you 've heard the stories ? The Black Pearl sails from the dreaded Isla de Mureta an island that can not be found except by those who already know where it is .
WILL: The ship 's real enough . So its anchorage must be a real place . Where is it ?
JACK: Why ask me ?
WILL: Because you 're a pirate .
JACK: And you want to turn pirate yourself ?
WILL: Never . They took Miss Swann .
JACK: So it is that you found a girl . Well , if you 're intending to brave all and hasten to her rescue and so win fai lady 's heart , you 'll have to do it alone . I see no profit in it for me .
WILL: I can get you out of here .
JACK: How ? The key 's run off .
WILL: I helped build these cells . Those are hook-and-ring hinges . The prope application of strength , the door 'll lift free . Just calls for the right lever and fulcrum . . .
JACK: Your name is Turner . Will gives him a puzzled look .
WILL: Yes . Will Turner . Jack grins .
JACK: Will Turner I 'll tell you what , Mr. Turner . I 've changed my mind . You spring me from this cell , and on pain of death , I 'll you to the Black Pearl . Do we have an accord ?
WILL: Agreed .
JACK: Agreed !
WILL: Someone will have heard that . Hurry .
JACK: Not without my effects .
WILL: We need to go !
JACK: My business , Will . As for your business -one question , or there 's no use going . This girl what does she mean to you ? How far are you willing to go to save her ?
WILL: I 'd die for her .
JACK: Good .
WILL: I have n't set foot off dry land I was twelve , when the ship I was on exploded . It 's been a sound policy .
JACK: No worries there . She 's far more likely to rot out from under us .
WILL: We 're going to steal a ship ? That ship ?
JACK: Commandeer . We 're going to commandeer a ship . Nautical term .
WILL: It 's still against the law .
WILL: This is either crazy , o illiant .
JACK: Remarkable how often those two traits coincide .
WILL: Aye ! Avast !
JACK: Dead serious .
GILLETTE: You understand this ship can not be crewed by only two men . You 'll neve make it out of the bay .
JACK: We 'll see about that .
GILLETTE: Sir , I 'll not see any of my men killed or wounded in this foolish enterprise .
JACK: Fine by me . We brought you a nice little boat , so you can all get back to shore , safe and sound .
GILLETTE: Agreed . You have the momentary advantage , sir . But I will see you smile from the yard arm sir .
JACK: As likely as not . Will , short up the anchor , we 've got ourselves a ship !
MURTOGG: I ca n't believe he 's doing this .
MULLROY: You did n't believe he was telling the truth , either .
GILLETTE: Do you have any idea , boy , what you 're doing ? Another quarter turn -
WILL: No .
JACK: Lookee there , mate ! We 're underway !
SWANN: Commodore
NORRINGTON: A moment .
SWANN: But
NORRINGTON: Please .
SWANN: Dammit , man , it appears someone is stealing your ship !
NORRINGTON: Rash , Turner , too rash .
WILL: They 're coming !
NORRINGTON: Search every cabin , every hold , down to the bilges !
JACK: Can you swim ? Can . You . Swim ? Jack removes his hand .
SENTRY: Of course , sir . Like a fish . I grew up summers living in Dover , with my uncle -
JACK: Good .
NORRINGTON: Sailors ! Back to the Interceptor !
JACK: Thank you , Commodore , for getting ou ship ready to make way ! We'd 've had a hard time of it by ourselves !
NORRINGTON: Raise the sails .
GILLETTE: The wind is quarter from astern by the time we 're underway , we 'll never catch them .
NORRINGTON: We need only to come about , to put them in range of the long nines .
GILLETTE: Hands ! Come about ! Jackets off the cannons ! We are to fire on our own ship ?
NORRINGTON: Better to see it at the bottom of the sea than in the hands of a pirate .
STEERSMAN: Captain , there 's a problem .
NORRINGTON: So it would seem .
GILLETTE: He 's got to be the best pirate I 've ever seen .
NORRINGTON: So it would seem .
ELIZABETH: Tell the captain that I am disinclined to acquiesce to his request .
BARBOSSA: Maid or not , it fits you .
BARBOSSA: Now , none of that . Please dig in .
ELIZABETH: It 's poisoned !
BARBOSSA: Oh , there would be no sense in killing you , Miss Turner .
ELIZABETH: Then why are n't you eating ?
BARBOSSA: Would that I could .
ELIZABETH: It 's a pirate medallion .
BARBOSSA: It 's a piece of the treasure of Isla de Muerta .
ELIZABETH: That 's all very interesting , but I hardly believe in ghost stories any more .
BARBOSSA: You idiot girl ! It 's no make- elieve ! My crew and I , we found the gold , and we did more than take one piece , we took it all . Rich men we were and we spent it and traded it and gave it away in exchange
JACK: For a man whose made an industry of avoiding boats , you 're a quick study .
WILL: I worked passage from England as a cabin boy . After my mother passed , I came out here looking for my father .
JACK: Is that so ?
WILL: My father . William Turner ?
JACK: I knew him . Probably one of the few who knew him as William Turner . Most everyone just called him Bill , or 'Bootstrap ' Bill .
WILL: 'Bootstrap ? '
JACK: Good man . Good pirate . And cleve - '' - I never met anyone with as clever a mind and hands as him . When you were puzzling out that cell door , it was like seeing his twin .
WILL: That 's not true .
JACK: I swear , you look just like him .
WILL: It 's not true that my father was a pirate .
JACK: Figured you would n't want to hea it .
WILL: He was a merchant marine ! He was a espectable man who obeyed the law , and followed the rules
JACK: You think your father is the only man who ever lived the Glasgow life , telling folk one thing , and then going off to do another ? There 's quite a few who come here , hoping to amass enough swag to ease the burdens of respectable
WILL: My father did not think of my mother -his family as a burden .
JACK: Sure because he could always go pirating .
WILL: My father was not a pirate !
JACK: Put it away , Will . It 's not worth getting beat again .
WILL: You did n't beat me . You ignored the rules of engagement . In a fai fight , I 'd kill you .
JACK: Then that 's not much incentive fo me to fight fair , is it ?
WILL: Tortuga ?
JACK: Oh did I forget to mention that ?
WILL: Just do it quickly .
JACK: Do n't worry . I 've already got my Quartermaster there !
ANAMARIA: You stole my boat .
JACK: AnaMaria ! Have you seen Gibbs ? I need to put together -
ANAMARIA: My dory . The Jolly Mon . Where is it ?
JACK: Safe ! At Port Royal . With the Royal Navy .
ANAMARIA: That boat is my livelihood !
JACK: You 'll get it back . Or one better .
ANAMARIA: I will .
WILL: Jack ! Over here !
GIBBS: Curse you for breathing , you slack-jawed idiot Mother 's love , Jack , you know etter than to wake a man when he 's sleeping . It 's bad luck !
JACK: Well , fortunately , I know how to counter it . The man who did the waking uys the man who was sleeping a drink , and the man who was sleeping it drinks it while listening to a proposition .
GIBBS: Aye , that 'll about do it .
WILL: I know . That was for the smell .
JACK: Just the one . Gibbs pauses . He takes a dainty sip .
GIBBS: Make it_ast , then . Now , what 's the nature of this venture of yours ?
GIBBS: Oh , there 's a hard tale , Jack . Most of the decent pirates in town wo n't sail with you seem to think you 're a jinx .
JACK: Now where , I wonder , would they have gotten that idea ?
GIBBS: Say again ?
JACK: Ilm going after the Black Pearl . I know where its going to be , and I 'm going to take it .
GIBBS: Jack , it 's a fool 's errand You 've heard the tales they tell about the Pearl .
JACK: Aye , and that 's why I know where it 's going to be , and that 's why I know what Barbossa is up to . All I need is a crew .
GIBBS: A fool 's errand .
GIBBS: And you 've got that , have you ?
JACK: Back there , guarding the door is the son of old Bootstrap Bill Turner .
GIBBS: Well , lookee there . I 'll allow you may be onto something , Jack . There 's bound to be sailors on this rock crazy as you . I 'll find some men .
JACK: That he is .
GIBBS: Feast your eyes , Cap ' n . All of 'em good sea-faring men , faithful hands efore the mast , every one worth his salt
ANAMARIA: You owe me a boat .
GIBBS: Cotton here is mute , sir . Poo devil had his tongue cut out
JACK: Mr. Cotton . Do you have the courage and fortitude to follow orders and stay true , in the face danger , and almost certain death ?
COTTON'S PARROT: Wind in your SAILS ! Wind in your SAILS !
GIBBS: Mostly , that seem to mean 'yes . '
WILL: Shut up , before you lose them all !
JACK: These are the only ones worth having . And we 're going to need them-
GIBBS: That fool will have us lose the canvas , and the masts besides !
JACK: She can hold a bit longer .
GIBBS: What 's in your head to put you in such a fine mood ?
JACK: We 're catching up !
TWIGG: Isla de Muerta ! Isla de Muerta , off the port bow !
JACOBY: Orders , Captain ?
BARBOSSA: Bring her in , not too close . I wo n't ave the reef , not until high tide . We lay anchor before dark .
JACK: Bear three points starboard .
GIBBS: Left handed-ropes are coiled against the sun , or it 's bad luck ! Anty-clockwise .
GIBBS: Now , lad , just because it do n't point north do n't mean it do n't work . That compass gives bearings to the Isla de Muerta , wherever it may lie .
WILL: Really ? So what 's the story on the pistol ?
GIBBS: I 'll tell lee . Now , Jack Sparrow has an honest streak in him , and that 's where the whole problem starts . This was when he was Captain of the Black Pearl -
WILL: What ? He never told me that .
GIBBS: Ah he 's learned , then . Plays things more close to the vest . See , Jack was a cartographer , back in Old England . Somehow I he came by the money to commission the Pearl . Hired himself a crew , promised each man an equal share . So , they 're forty days out , and the First Mate says , everything 's an equal share , that should mean the location of the island , too . So Jack gave up the earings . That night , there was mutiny .
WILL: How did he get off the island ?
JACK: I did n't !
GIBBS: How did you get off the island ?
JACK: Ah , that 's a dark and unpleasant tale , best left untold . He starts off .
WILL: Wait what about the pistol ?
JACK: The pistol . When a pirate is marooned , Will , he 's given a pistol with a single shot . No good for hunting , o surviving , really . But after three weeks of starvation and thirst the option of that pistol begins to look good .
KOEHLER: Moonrise , Captain ! First night of full .
BARBOSSA: Hah ! Be mindful of pits and crevasses . Stay together .
COTTON'S PARROT: Land HO ! Land HO ! LAND ho ! LAND ho !
ANAMARIA: How does he do that ?
JACK: They 'll be anchored on the lee side . Haul your wind , and keep to the weathe of the island -
ELIZABETH: The curse drove you to gathe this ?
WILL: What 's that ?
JACK: Depends .
WILL: On what ?
JACK: On whether the stories are all true . If they are , that 's a waterfall that spills over at high tide , with a short drop to an underground lagoon . If not -
BARBOSSA: Here we stand before the cursed treasure of Cortez himself . Won by lood , it demands blood in return .
KOEHLER: Did it work ?
DEADEYE: I do n't feel no different .
JACOBY: How do we tell ?
KOEHLER: You 're not dead .
JACOBY: No . He shot me !
BARBOSSA: You . Maid . Your father . What was his name ? ! Was your father William Turner ? !
ELIZABETH: No .
BARBOSSA: Where 's his child ? The child that sailed from England eight years ago , the child who is the real owner of that medallion , the child in whose veins flows the blood of William Turner ? ! Where ?
JACOBY: You brought us the wrong person !
TWIGG: You brought us here for nothing ? Barbossa whirls on him
ELIZABETH: You ? !
JACK: Me !
ELIZABETH: You 're in league with Barbossa !
JACK: No , I 'm rescuing you . Elizabeth ca n't comprehend that one .
ELIZABETH: You ? ! Will gains his footing in the rubble .
WILL: Miss Swann ! We 're here to rescue you ! It 's going badly !
JACK: This way ! They race off , toward a bit of moonlight -
WILL: I 'm glad we got here in time .
ELIZABETH: Truthfully you were a bit late .
JACK: The trick is n't getting here , it 's getting away .
ELIZABETH: Come on !
WILL: No .
JACK: I 'll lead them away . The sounds are closer .
WILL: Are you sure ? Jack this is not something you have to do .
JACK: I 'm sure . When you 've led the kind of life I have , there are debts that must be paid . Maybe I can alance the scales a little .
BARBOSSA: I 'm inclined to kill you now , Jack Sparrow , without so much as a word , if you do n't lose that grin from your face .
JACK: The woman 's blood did n't work , did it ? Barbossa hesitates .
BARBOSSA: Say the name , or I slit you throat .
JACK: No you wo n't .
BARBOSSA: The Pearl ? Oh , that 's fine . And just how do you expect this to work ?
JACK: You give me the Pearl . Then I tell you who you need . Barbossa stares at him , incredulous .
BARBOSSA: That 's your offer ? You , sailing away nice and pretty with the Black Pearl , and all I have is a name ?
JACK: That 's right .
BARBOSSA: I 'm supposed to trust you ? The pirates laugh .
JACK: I 'm a man of my word . The pirates laugh louder .
BARBOSSA: I 'll torture it out of you .
JACK: You left me on a desert island what worse can you do ?
BARBOSSA: Blast you ! I 'll throw you in prison .
JACK: Wait as long as you like .
BARBOSSA: You 're setting me up for a double cross , you with the ship , and me with nothing more than your word !
JACK: Let 's say I tell you the wrong person . What would you do ?
BARBOSSA: Track you down and - He sees where Jack is headed .
JACK: And if I tell you the truth , you become mortal , and you wo n't come near me ecause you know I 'd kill you .
BARBOSSA: Jack , I do n't trust you , and that 's a fact . Never trust a smiling man , you can lay to that .
JACK: See , that 's where we 're different . I trust you to do what it takes to get what you want .
BARBOSSA: You 're playing this as close to the edge as any man , I 'll give you that .
JACK: What you do n't have the medallion ?
BARBOSSA: That fool woman took it . You be careful around her , Jack she 's pretty enough , she 'll steal you heart but pure evil inside .
JACK: I 'll watch my back .
BARBOSSA: Bosun ! Set up Mr. Sparrow 's quarters , nice and fine in the brig . Meaning no disrespect , of course .
GIBBS: Two women on board ? A man do n't have to e superstitious to know that 's trouble .
ELIZABETH: you were in danger so I took the medallion . And I 've kept it eve since . They thought I was you , that they needed my blood . And it did n't work . She hands him the medallion .
WILL: Why would my father send this to me ?
ELIZABETH: To keep it away from them ? No pirate would sail to London , for fear of Execution Dock .
WILL: If I had known-
ELIZABETH: then we never would have met .
WILL: I ca n't believe he would make such a sacrifice for us .
ELIZABETH: I guess you can never truly know someone else 's heart . Will glances at her , and nods .
GIBBS: Shift your heading , steer clear of that island . Fifteen degrees starboard .
COTTON'S PARROT: Dead men tell NO tales ! Dead men tell NO tales ! Dead men tell NO tales !
ANAMARIA: Can we outrun them ?
GIBBS: Not a chance . Make for the reef .
BARBOSSA: All hands ! Prepare to come about !
JACK: Do n't hit my ship ! I mean , kill the lying scoundrel - I 'm a little conflicted , here . Twigg just stares .
BARBOSSA: Strike your colors , you bloody cockroaches !
ANAMARIA: Looks like they mean to send us under .
GIBBS: There she 's raised the Jolly Roger , upside down .
WILL: We 're not going to just surrender ! GIBBS That we are .
GIBBS: Will it 'll go worse for us fo Elizabeth , especially if we fight .
BARBOSSA: Welcome back , Miss . Last time on board , you played me right clever , make pretending and all . I hope your stay this time is more pleasant . Boys , show her some hospitality !
WILL: She goes free !
BARBOSSA: What 's in your head , boy ?
WILL: She . Goes . Free .
BARBOSSA: You 've got one shot and we ca n't die .
WILL: You ca n't . I can . He leans out over the ocean .
ELIZABETH: No ! Jack pushes forward .
WILL: My name is Will Turner , the son of Bootstrap Bill Turner . His blood runs in my veins . You need my blood . And on my word I will pull this trigger , and sink all the way down to Davy Jones ' Locker !
TWIGG: It 's true - he 's the spittin ' image of old Bootstrap . Even talks the same ! Jack drops his head . Barbossa grins at him .
BARBOSSA: Looks like you 're back to having nothing to offer .
WILL: Elizabeth goes free !
BARBOSSA: We got that part . Anything else ?
WILL: And Jack . And the crew . Free and unharmed . I f you agree then I will remain with you . Barbossa considers ; his crew waits . Finally -
ELIZABETH: Will you ca n't trust him .
WILL: You must swear by the Holy Bible .
BARBOSSA: Eh ? You have my word , then on the Good Book , I do swear , and the Lord spare my worthless soul .
GIBBS: Amen to that
BARBOSSA: Jack , Elizabeth I 'm a man of my word and you 're to be set free , right quick . Men , break out the plank !
WILL: No ! You gave your word !
BARBOSSA: Quiet , boy , or you 'll lose your tongue . Those as know me know I would n't cross my word , and bring down bad luck on the ship . I agreed to set them free . I did n't say when . .. nor where .
JACK: It 's pure evil to make a Captain walk the plank of his own ship , twice in one lifetime . No good can come of it .
BARBOSSA: Now , Jack . That reef is less than a league distant . It 's a square deal all around , and you ca n't hope for better .
JACK: Someone needs to cut these bonds , then .
BARBOSSA: You 'd best take a swim , Jack .
JACK: The last time you did this , you left me a pistol , with one shot . The pirates mutter agreement .
BARBOSSA: By the Powers , you 're right ! Where 's Jack 's pistol ? Who 's got it ? Bring it forward !
JACK: A gentleman might give us two pistols , seeing as there are two of us , this time . A pirate hands Jack 's pistol to Barbossa .
BARBOSSA: Tell you what . I 'll give you one pistol , and let you be the gentleman , an ' shoot the lady , and starve to death yourself !
JACK: You can go to your grave not knowing .
BARBOSSA: That 's fair .
ELIZABETH: Here it will go well with you lack heart ! Barbossa indicates the plank .
BARBOSSA: Have at her , lads !
ELIZABETH: You went back for that ? We need to head for the reef !
JACK: That 's the second time I 've had to watch that man sail away with my ship . He turns away , and swims after Elizabeth .
ELIZABETH: Has it changed since the last time you were here ?
JACK: The trees are taller .
ELIZABETH: I hope you have no intention of using that .
JACK: Not yet . Ask me again in a few weeks . Elizabeth ca n't believe it .
ELIZABETH: Captain Sparrow ! We have to get off this island immediately !
ELIZABETH: What is that ? Is there a boat under there ?
JACK: It wo n't . It wo n't , and so we wo n't .
ELIZABETH: But you did it before ! Last time -
JACK: Last time , I was here a grand total of three days . Last time , the rumrunners who used this island as a cache came by , and I artered passage off .
ELIZABETH: So that 's it ? That 's the secret grand adventure of the infamous
JACK: Welcome to the Caribbean , love .
ELIZABETH: A month ? Will does n't have a month ! We 've got to do something to help him !
JACK: You 're right . Here 's luck to you , Will Turner .
ELIZABETH: Not when you can drink instead , at least . Jack tosses her a bottle .
ELIZABETH: And you will call me Miss Swann .
JACK: What ? What was that ? Something funny , Miss Swann ? share . Please ,
ELIZABETH: Nothing it 's nothing . Just I 'm reminded of a song I learned as a child . A song about pirates .
JACK: I know a lot of songs about pirates , ut none I 'd teach a child . Let 's hea it .
ELIZABETH: Oh , no it 's silly . Back in England we did n't know a thing about pirates , really . They seemed so romantic and daring - Jack likes the way that sounds .
ELIZABETH: Well , perhaps with a bit more to drink , I might
JACK: More to drink !
ELIZABETH: We pillage , we plunder , we rifle , we loot , Drink up me hearties , yo ho . She gestures for him to drink . He does .
JACK: I LOVE this song ! Yo ho , yo ho , a pirate 's life fo me ! We 're beggars and blighters ,
ELIZABETH: You 'll be positively the most fearsome pirates to sail the Spanish Main .
JACK: Not just the Spanish Main . The whole ocean . .. the whole world . Wherever we want to go , we go . That 's what a ship is , you know . Not just a keel and a hull and a deck and sails . That 's what a ship need_ but what a ship is what the Black Pearl really-is is freedom . Elizabeth lays her head on his shoulder .
ELIZABETH: Jack , it must be so terrible for you , to be trapped here on this island , all over again .
JACK: Ah , well the company is bette than last time . And the scenery has definitely improved .
JACK: We 've got a few bottles left and we 've yet to tap the kegs .
ELIZABETH: To freedom .
JACK: To the Black Pearl .
ELIZABETH: Yes , the rum is gone .
ELIZABETH: One , because it is a vile drink that turns even the most respectable men into scoundrels . Two - She points to the sky .
JACK: You you burned up the island , for a one-time chance at being spotted ?
ELIZABETH: Exactly . Elizabeth turns toward the sea .
NORRINGTON: Elizabeth , I 'm '' relieved you 're safe . Clap him in irons . And behind his ack this time .
ELIZABETII: Commodore , you ca n't do that !
NORRINGTON: You 're speaking up for him again ?
ELIZABETH: He can locate Isla de Muerta ut I doubt he 'll be willing to help us from the brig .
JACK: We had time to get to know each other .
NORRINGTON: We are bound for Port Royal , not Isla de Muerta .
ELIZABETH: No . The pirates have taken Will -
NORRINGTON: Your father is frantic with worry . Our mission was to rescue you and eturn home . That is what we shall do . Mr. Turner 's fate is egrettable . But so was his decision to engage in piracy .
ELIZABETH: Commodore , please !
NORRINGTON: By remembering that I serve others , not only myself .
ELIZABETH: Commodore , I beg you please do this for me . As a wedding gift .
NORRINGTON: I am to understand that you will accept my marriage proposal on the condition I rescue Mr. Turner ?
ELIZABETH: Not as a condition a request . Norrington considers . To Gillette
NORRINGTON: Free Mister Sparrow , and prepare to come about . He 'll give you our heading .
JACK: Congratulations , sir .
NORRINGTON: Elizabeth , I hereby withdraw my proposal .
ELIZABETH: What ?
NORRINGTON: I know now where your heart truly lies .
ELIZABETH: And now I know where yours does , as well .
NORRINGTON: You may seclude yourself in my cabin . I 'm afraid we do not have any ladies ' clothing aboard .
ELIZABETH: Then I can wear men 's clothing .
NORRINGTON: That would hardly be proper .
ELIZABETH: Well , I am not going to stay hidden in a some cabin , 80 I suppose it 's going to be heaving osoms and bare ankles for the emainder of the voyage !
NORRINGTON: Murtogg , take our guest below , and find her some trousers , and a shirt .
WILL: What happened to William Turner ?
BARBOSSA: Bring him .
ELIZABETH: You did n't tell Commodore Norrington everything .
JACK: Nor did you , I noticed .
ELIZABETH: He might delay the rescue and that would be too late .
JACK: Exactly .
ELIZABETH: These men will be facing an enemy that seemingly can not be killed .
JACK: I have a plan . If it succeeds , then any attle will be decidedly brief and one-sided .
ELIZABETH: What 's your plan ?
NORRINGTON: Elizabeth below decks . I will not compromise your safety.. She starts to speak ; he turns away..
JACK: Funny , I was thinking along those lines . How about you let me go in alone , and while you 're setting up an ambush , I 'll trick the pirates out to you .
NORRINGTON: You would do that ?
JACK: They left me stranded . Twice . What have you got to lose ?
NORRINGTON: Nothing I would n't be please to be rid of .
JACK: I knew you 'd listen to reason !
NORRINGTON: I 'll be at the wheel myself .
JACK: I 'll slip in , talk them into to come out , and you 'll be free to blow holy high heaven the whole lot of them .
BARBOSSA: Turner blood does n't flow pure in his veins . Best play it safe , and spill it all .
WILL: You deserve to be cursed and emain cursed !
BARBOSSA: Blast him ! A pox on him , and his father , and the whole damnable line ! Fan out ! Find him !
COTTON'S PARROT: Drink UP me hearties yo ho ! Drink UP me hearties yo ho !
JACK: Do you have any idea where you 're going ?
WILL: Jack !
JACK: Do n't talk . These caves magnify sound . Just follow me .
WILL: Are you certain this is the right way ?
JACK: It 's the right way .
BARBOSSA: Thank you , Jack Sparrow .
WILL: You did know where you were going ! You did lead us directly to them ! Why ?
BARBOSSA: What was begun by blood , let blood now end ! He raises the knife to Will 's throat -
JACK: You do n't want to be doing that . Barbossa pretends to think about his words .
BARBOSSA: No , I really think I do .
JACK: All right then .
BARBOSSA: Why do n't I want to do this ?
JACK: Because , right about now , the H.M.S . Dauntless is lying in wait in the harbor .
WILL: Jack !
JACK: - - and its guns and crew will cut you and your men to pieces the moment you step outside these caves .
BARBOSSA: No . But him I believe . He is genuinely angry .
JACK: You 've no hope of surviving Norrington 's attack that is , if you 're mortal .
BARBOSSA: What 're you suggesting ?
JACK: Simple . Do n't kill the boy yet . Wait for a more opportune moment .
BARBOSSA: I ca n't help wondering , Jack , why you 're being so helpful and all ? Last time you did that , it did n't end 80 well for you .
JACK: The situation has changed .
BARBOSSA: That so ?
JACK: Aye . See , after you 're done with the Royal Navy , you 'll have a bit of a problem the H.M.S . Dauntless . There you 'll be , with two lovely ships on your hands , and what to do ? Of course you 'll decide you deserve the bigge one , and who 's to argue ? The Dauntless a first-rate ship-of-line , and with it , you can rule the seas .
BARBOSSA: Men ! Are you up for it ? The pirates yell to the affirmative .
JACK: There 's another exit ?
BARBOSSA: Aye , for us there is .
TALL SAILOR: Ship rats . Big ones .
SHORT SAILOR: Hate those things .
TALL SAILOR: That they do .
SKINNY: Which would you prefer first , good sir -rum , or wine ?
GILLETTE: All the men in place , sir . Ready to fire .
NORRINGTON: Wait for my order what the blazes is that ?
WILL: You 've been planning this from the eginning . Since you learned my name .
JACK: Oh , please do I really seem that clever ?
BARBOSSA: Confound it , Jack I was actually beginning to like you ! Swords are drawn , and the Pirates attack .
NORRINGTON: Steady , men ! Remember we 're the Navy !
GILLETTE: They 're on our side ! Take heart , men ! The Royal Navy stand their ground and fight -
BARBOSSA: Just so you know , Jack I do n't think you 're that clever . I think you 're a fool . A mortal fool .
JACK: Remarkable how often those two traits coincide . Jack drives him back , making Barbossa laugh .
BARBOSSA: You ca n't beat me , Jack .
WILL: Jack !
JACK: Well , is n't that interesting .
BARBOSSA: So what now , Jack Sparrow ? Are we to be two immortals , locked in epic battle until the trumpets of Judgment Day ?
JACK: Or you could surrender .
BARBOSSA: Or I could chain you to a cannonball and drop you in the deepest part of the ocean , where you can contemplate your folly forever .
WILL: He did n't waste it .
JACK: The worst . On the other hand , maybe I 'm a man who ca n't pass up a chance for revenge against the black-hearted bastard who stole my ship and left me to die in the middle of the ocean twice ! and who knows how to get what he wants . Now that 's a great pirate .
WILL: Let 's get out of here .
ELIZABETH: You 're all right !
WILL: Miss Swann are you wearing trousers ? And how did you get off the island ?
ELIZABETH: Yes , I am wearing trousers . And as fo how we got off the island ah , that 's a grand adventure , but now is not the time to talk about it .
WILL: Elizabeth , I think it does n't matter- that we are of a different class -
ELIZABETH: It does n't !
WILL: but that was not a proper kiss . Pure consternation on Elizabeth 's face -
JACK: Tough luck . I was rooting for you .
NORRINGTON: and though I do say so with egret , the law is clear . The penalty for piracy is death by hanging .
SWANN: By your leave , I wish to speak on ehalf of the boy . It is clear that these deeds were performed out of a sincere desire to do good , at great personal risk . It seems to me , that in the rare occasion where the right course is committing an act of piracy , then an act of piracy is the ight course ! So in my capacity as Governor , I intend to grant a pardon to
GILLETTE: Sir !
SWANN: The Black Pearl !
GILLETTE: Sir ! Shall I break out the cannons ?
NORRINGTON: I do n't think that will be necessary .
ANAMARIA: Captain Sparrow the Black Pearl is yours !
JACK: AnaMaria , trim the mainsail !
ANAMARIA: Aye , aye , sir !
JACK: Mr. Gibbs , organize a cleaning detail - you and Cotton . I want every inch of the Pearl spic-and-span and ship-shape !
THE END: FADE OUT and CREDITS ROLL
ELIZABETH SWANN: Will !
WILL TURNER: I do n't know . You look beautiful .
ELIZABETH SWANN: I think it 's bad luck for the groom to see the bride before the wedding .
WILL TURNER: No !
ELIZABETH SWANN: *What are the charges ? *
WILL TURNER: Lord Beckett ! In the category of questions *not* answered
ELIZABETH SWANN: We are under the jurisdiction of the King 's governor of Port Royal , and you will tell us what we are charged with .
GIBBS: Fifteen men on a dead man 's chest . Yo ho ho , and a *bottle* of rum . Drink and the devil had done for the rest .
JACK SPARROW: Sorry , mate .
GIBBS: Not *quite* according to plan .
JACK SPARROW: Complications arose , ensued , were overcome .
GIBBS: You got what you went in for , then ?
JACK SPARROW: Mm-hmm !
GIBBS: Captain , I think the crew , meaning me as well , were expecting something a it more *shiny* . What with the Isla de Muerta going all pear shaped , reclaimed y the sea , and the treasure with it .
LEECH: And the Royal Navy chasing us all around the Atlantic .
MARTY: And the hurricane ! Aye .
CREW: Aye . Aye .
GIBBS: All in all , it 's seems some time since we did a speck of honest pirating .
JACK SPARROW: Shiny ?
GIBBS: Aye , shiny .
JACK SPARROW: Is that how you 're all feeling , then ? Perhaps dear old Jack is not serving your best interests as captain ?
COTTON'S PARROT: Awk ! Walk the plank !
JACK SPARROW: What did the bird say ?
LEECH: Do not blame the bird . Show us what is on that piece of cloth there .
JACK SPARROW: Ohhh !
GIBBS: Know that do n't do no good .
JACK SPARROW: It does me .
MARTY: It 's a key !
JACK SPARROW: No ! Much more better . It is a *drawing* of a key .
LEECH: Keys unlock *things* ?
GIBBS: And whatever this key unlocks , *inside* there 's something valuable . So , we 're setting out to find whatever this key unlocks !
JACK SPARROW: No ! If we do n't have the key , we ca n't open whatever it is we do n't have that it unlocks . So what purpose would be served in finding whatever need be unlocked , which we do n't have , without first having found the key what unlocks it ?
GIBBS: So - We 're going after this key !
JACK SPARROW: You 're not making any sense at all . Any more questions ?
MARTY: So Do we have a heading ?
JACK SPARROW: Hah ! A heading . Set sail in a mmm a general in *that* way - direction .
GIBBS: Cap ' n ?
JACK SPARROW: Come on , snap to and make sail , you know how this works . Come on , ? oy/ ? quick , ? oy/ ? quick , hey !
MARTY: Have you noticed lately The captain seems to be actin ' a bit strange -er .
GIBBS: Settin ' sail without knowing his own headin ' ? Somethin 's got Jack vexed . Mark my words , what bodes ill for Jack Sparrow bodes ill for us all .
GUARD: Lord Beckett . The prisoner as ordered , Sir .
WILL TURNER: More acquaintance than friend . How do you know him ?
JACK SPARROW: Why is the rum always gone ?
GIBBS: Lift the skin up !
JACK SPARROW: All on deck ! Run ! And keep running ! Run as if the devil himself and itself is upon us !
GIBBS: Do we have a heading ?
JACK SPARROW: Ah ! Ooh ! Run ! Land .
GIBBS: Which port ?
JACK SPARROW: Did n't say port . I said land . Any land .
GIBBS: Jack 's hat ! Bring 'er about !
JACK SPARROW: No no ! Leave it ! Run !
GIBBS: Back to your stations ! The lot o ' ya !
JACK SPARROW: Shhh !
GIBBS: For the love of mother and child , Jack , what 's coming after us ?
JACK SPARROW: Nothing . small fishing vessel
TURKISH FISHERMAN: Heh-heh-heh. ? tupayHey ! ? Fo ? pes ? sa ? kapazun kapitan ? de ? la ? mezande , huh ?
GREEK FISHERMAN: ? Etora . ? Fetsoran ? ipitos . ? Ferinte . arrive , huh ?
CARRUTHERS: Here now . He ca n't be here .
ELIZABETH SWANN: Jack 's Compass . What does Beckett want with that ?
WILL TURNER: Does it matter ? I 'm to find Jack and convince him to return to Port Royal . In exchange the charges against us will e dropped .
ELIZABETH SWANN: I have faith in you . Both of you . Where will you find him ?
WILL TURNER: Tortuga . I 'll start there , and I wo n't stop searching 'til I find him . And then I intend to return here , to marry you .
ELIZABETH SWANN: Properly ?
WILL TURNER: Eagerly , if you 'll still have me .
ELIZABETH SWANN: If it were n't for these bars I 'd have you already .
WILL TURNER: Keep a weather eye on the horizon .
WEATHERED SAILOR: *Captain* Jack Sparrow ? Owes me fou dubloons . Heard he was dead .
GISELLE: Jack Sparrow !
SCARLETT: I have n't seen 'im in a month .
GISELLE: When you find him , will you give him a message ?

CANNIBAL ISLAND: throne
JACK SPARROW: Thank you .
CANNIBAL ISLAND: cages
WILL TURNER: Why would he do this to us ? If Jack is their chief .
GIBBS: Aye , the Pelegostos made Jack thei chief . But he only remains chief as long as he *acts* like a chief .
WILL TURNER: So he had no choice . He 's a captive then as much as the rest of us .
GIBBS: Worse as it turns out . See , the Pelegostos elieve that Jack is a *god* in human form , and they intend to do him the honor of releasing him from his fleshy prison .
WILL TURNER: Where 's the rest of the crew ?
GIBBS: These cages we 're in were n't built 'til *after* we got here .
WILL TURNER: Well , we ca n't just sit here and wait then , can we ?
CANNIBAL ISLAND: throne

WILL TURNER: What about Jack ? I wo n't leave without him .
JACK SPARROW: Hey !
WILL TURNER: Time to go .
GIBBS: *Cast off those lines ! * Make ready to cast off ! # # # !
JACK SPARROW: Good doggie ! ? Doggie .
GIBBS: Let 's put some distance between us and this island , and head out to open sea .
JACK SPARROW: Yes to the first , yes to the second , ut only insofar as we keep to the shallows as much as possible .
GIBBS: Uh , that seems a bit contradictory , Captain .
JACK SPARROW: I have every faith in your reconciliatory navigational skills , Master Gibbs , now where is that monkey ? I want to shoot *something* .
WILL TURNER: Jack .
JACK SPARROW: Ah .
WILL TURNER: Elizabeth is in danger .
JACK SPARROW: Have you considered keeping a more watchful eye on 'er ? Maybe just lock her up somewhere .
WILL TURNER: She *is* locked up , in a prison , bound to hang for helping *you* !
JACK SPARROW: There comes a time when one must take esponsibility for one 's mistakes .
WILL TURNER: I need that Compass of yours , Jack . I must trade it for her freedom .
JACK SPARROW: Mister Gibbs !
GIBBS: Cap ' n .
JACK SPARROW: We have a need to travel upriver .
GIBBS: By need , d'you mean a trifling need , ? uh/ ? a fleeting , as in say in a passing fancy ?
JACK SPARROW: No , a resolute and unyielding need .
WILL TURNER: What we need to do is make sail fo Port Royal with all haste .
JACK SPARROW: William I shall trade you the Compass , if you will help me to find *this* .
WILL TURNER: You want me to find this ?
JACK SPARROW: No . *You* want you to find this . Because the finding this finds you incapacitorially finding and/or locating and your discovering the detecting of a way to save you ? dolly/ ? dotty belle ol ' what's-her-face . Savvy ?
WILL TURNER: This is going to save Elizabeth ?
JACK SPARROW: How much do you know about Davy Jones ?
WILL TURNER: Not much .
JACK SPARROW: Yeah , it 's gon na save Elizabeth . Edinburgh Trade
BELLAMY: What 's all this ? If you both fancy the dress , you 'll just have to share , and wear it one after the other .
BURSAR: It 's not like that , Sir . This ship is haunted .
BELLAMY: Is it now ? ' N ' you ?
QUARTERMASTER: The female presence amongst us , yes all the men they can feel it .
BURSAR: I say that we throw the dress overboard , and we hope the spirit finds it .
QUARTERMASTER: No ! That - that will just anger the spirit , Sir . What we need to do is find out what the spirit needs , and then just get it back !
WILL TURNER: Why is Jack afraid of the open ocean ?
GIBBS: Well , if you believe such things , there 's a beast does the bidding of Davy Jones . A fearsome creature with giant tentacles that suction your face clean off . And drag an entire ship past the crushing darkness . The Kraken !
WILL TURNER: And the key will spare him that ?
GIBBS: Now that 's the very question Jack wants answered . Bad enough even to go visit *Her* .
WILL TURNER: Her ?
GIBBS: Aye .
BAYOU: Tia 's shack
JACK SPARROW: No worries , mates . Tia Dalma and I go way back . Thick as thieves . Nigh inseparable we are . Were . Have been . Before .
GIBBS: I 'll watch your back .
JACK SPARROW: It 's me front I 'm worried about . Mind the boat .
GIBBS: Mind the boat .
?WILL TURNER: Mind the boat .
MARTY: Mind the boat .
COTTON'S PARROT: Awk ! Mind the boat !
TIA DALMA: Jack Sparrow !
JACK SPARROW: Tia Dalma !
TIA DALMA: I always know de wind was goin ' blow you back to me one day .
WILL TURNER: You know me ?
TIA DALMA: You want to know *me* .
JACK SPARROW: There 'll be no knowing here . We 've come for help and we 're not leaving without it .
TIA DALMA: Not so well as I had hoped . Come .
JACK SPARROW: Come .
TIA DALMA: What service may I do you ? Hmmm ? You know I demand payment .
JACK SPARROW: I brought payment .
GIBBS: No ! You 've no idea how long it took us to catch that .
TIA DALMA: The payment is fair .
JACK SPARROW: We 're looking for this . And what it goes to .
TIA DALMA: The Compass you bartered from me . It can not lead you to dis ?
JACK SPARROW: Maybe . Why ?
TIA DALMA: Ayeee Jack Sparrow does not know what he wants ! Or do know , but are loathe to claim it as your own . You key go to a chest , and it is what lay inside the chest you seek , do n't it ?
GIBBS: What *is* inside ?
RAGETTI: Nothing bad , I hope .
TIA DALMA: You know of Davy Jones , yes ? A man of de sea . A great sailor , until he an afoul of dat which vex all men .
WILL TURNER: What vexes all men ?
TIA DALMA: What , indeed .
GIBBS: The sea ?
RAGETTI: Dichotomy of good and evil .
JACK SPARROW: A *woman* .
TIA DALMA: A wo-*man* . He fell in love .
GIBBS: No-no-no-no , I heard it was the *sea* he fell in love with .
TIA DALMA: Same story , different versions , and all are true . See , it was a *woman* , as changing , and harsh , and untamable as the sea . Him never stopped loving her . But the pain it cause 'im was too much to live wid . But not enough to cause him to die .
WILL TURNER: What exactly did he put into the chest ?
TIA DALMA: Him heart .
RAGETTI: Literally , or figuratively ?
TIA DALMA: It was not wort ' feeling what small fleeting joy life brings , and so he carved out him heart , lock it away in a chest , and hide de chest from de world . De keys , he keep wid him at all times .
WILL TURNER: You knew this .
JACK SPARROW: I did not . I did n't know where the key was . But now we do . So all that 's left is to climb aboard the Flying Dutchman , grab the key , you go back to Port Royal and save your bonnie lass , hey !
TIA DALMA: Let me see your hand .
GIBBS: Uhhh ! The black spot !
JACK SPARROW: My eyesight 's as good as ever , just so you know .
TIA DALMA: I am justMy little # # # , where are you ? # # #
JACK SPARROW: Dirt . This is a jar of dirt .
TIA DALMA: Yes ?
JACK SPARROW: Is the jar of dirt going to help ?
TIA DALMA: If you don ' want it , give it back .
JACK SPARROW: No .
TIA DALMA: Den it helps .
WILL TURNER: It seems we have a need to find the Flying Dutchman .
TIA DALMA: A touch of destiny !
WILL TURNER: That 's the Flying Dutchman ? She does n't look like much .
JACK SPARROW: Neither do you . Do *not* underestimate her .
GIBBS: Must 've run afoul of the reef .
JACK SPARROW: So what 's your plan , then ?
WILL TURNER: I row over , search the ship until I find your bloody key .
JACK SPARROW: And if there are crewmen ?
WILL TURNER: I cut down anyone in my path .
JACK SPARROW: I like it . Simple , easy to remember .
RAGETTI: Your chariot awaits you , sire ! Ha , ha-ha-ha , ha-ha !
JACK SPARROW: Hey ! If you *do* happen to get captured , just say Jack Sparrow sent you to settle his debt ! Might save your life !
RAGETTI: Bon voyage ! Ha-ha-ha !
JACK SPARROW: Douse the lamps .
SCUTTLED SHIP: before attack
WOUNDED SAILOR: up the
WILL TURNER: Sailor !
WOUNDED SAILOR: the stenchcapsized
WILL TURNER: Sailor !
WOUNDED SAILOR: bring a
WILL TURNER: There 's no use . You 've run aground .
WOUNDED SAILOR: No ! Beneath us ! Foul breath !
WILL TURNER: Hey ! Hey !
GREENBEARD: Down on your marrowbones , and pray .
WILL TURNER: Get back ! Back !
SCUTTLED SHIP: after attack
MACCUS: Five men still alive . The rest have moved on .
DAVY JONES: Do you fear death ? Do you fear that dark abyss ? All your deeds laid bare . All your sins punished . I can offe you an escape-uh .
CHAPLAIN: Do n't listen to him !
DAVY JONES: Do you not fear death ?
CHAPLAIN: I 'll take my chances , Sir .
DAVY JONES: To the depths .
HELMSMAN: I - I will , serve .
DAVY JONES: ? Grand .
WILL TURNER: Jack Sparrow sent me to settle his debt .
DAVY JONES: What is your purpose here ?
WILL TURNER: Jack Sparrow . He sent me to settle his debt .
DAVY JONES: Huh ! Did he , now ? I 'm sorely tempted to accept that offer .
JACK SPARROW: Oh .
DAVY JONES: You have a debt to pay . You 've been captain of the Black Pearl for thirteen years . *That* was our agreement .
JACK SPARROW: Technically , I was only captain fo two years , then I was viciously mutinied upon .
DAVY JONES: Then you were a poor captain , but a *captain* nonetheless ! Have you not introduced yourself all these years as *Captain* Jack Sparrow ?
JACK SPARROW: You have my payment . One soul to serve on your ship is already over there .
DAVY JONES: One soul is not equal to another .
JACK SPARROW: Aha ! So we 've established my proposal is sound in principle , now we 're just haggling over price .
DAVY JONES: Price ? Pttt !
JACK SPARROW: Just how many souls do you think my soul is worth ?
DAVY JONES: One hundred souls , three days-uh .
JACK SPARROW: You 're a diamond , mate . Send me back the boy , I 'll get started right off .
DAVY JONES: I keep the boy . A good-faith payment . That leaves you only ninety-nine more to go . Ha ha ! Ha ha ! Ha ha !
JACK SPARROW: Have you not met Will Turner ? He 's noble , heroic , *terrific* soprano . Worth at least four maybe three and a half . And did I happen to mention he 's in love . With a girl . Due to be married . Betrothed . Dividing him from her and her from him would only be half as cruel as actually allowing them be joined in holy matrimony . Aye ?
DAVY JONES: I keep the boy . Ninety-nine souls-uh . But I wonder , Sparrow , can you live with this ? Can you condemn an innocent man - a friend-uh - to a lifetime of servitude , in your name while you roam free ?
JACK SPARROW: Yep ! I 'm good with it . Should we seal it in blood ? I mean mm-mm - ink ?
DAVY JONES: Three days . Three days .
JACK SPARROW: Oh , Mr. Gibbs .
GIBBS: Aye .
JACK SPARROW: Uh , I feel sullied and unusual .
GIBBS: And how do you intend to harvest these ninety-nine souls in three days ?
JACK SPARROW: Fortunately , he was mum as the condition in which these souls need be .
GIBBS: Ah Tortuga !
JACK SPARROW: Tortuga . Edinburgh Trade
BELLAMY: It 's an outrage . Port tariffs , berthing fees , *wharf* handling , and heaven help us , pilotage . Are we all to work fo the East India Trading Company , then ?
QUARTERMASTER: I 'm afraid , Sir Tortuga is the only free port left in these waters .
BELLAMY: A *pirate* port is what you mean . Well , I 'm sorry . An honest sailor is what I am . I make my living fair , and I sleep well each night , thank you .
BURSAR: S-S-Sir !
BELLAMY: She 's tryna give a sign .
QUARTERMASTER: Look there ! There it is . There 's the sign .
?BURSAR: That 's seaweed .
QUARTERMASTER: S-Seaweed can be a sign .
?BURSAR: Looks like entrails . ? That ? would be a bad sign .
ELIZABETH SWANN: What 's that over there ?
GIBBS: And what makes you think you 're worthy to crew the Black Pearl ?
ELDERLY MAN: Truth be told , I never sailed a day in me life . I figure I should get out and see the world while I 'm still young .
GIBBS: You 'll do . Make your mark . Next !
JILTED MAN: My wife ran off with my dog . And I 'm drunk for a month . And I do n't give a ass rat 's if I live or die .
GIBBS: Perfect ! Next !
JACK SPARROW: I know what I want .
GIBBS: Next !
ROMANTIC MAN: Ever since I was a little lad , I 've always wanted to sail the seas . Forever .
GIBBS: Sooner than you think . Sign the roster .
ROMANTIC MAN: Thanks very much .
JACK SPARROW: How we going ?
GIBBS: Including those four ? That gives us - four !
NORRINGTON: My story it 's exactly the same as your story , just one chapter behind . I chased a man across the Seven Seas . The pursuit cost me my crew , my commission , and my life .
GIBBS: Commodore ?
NORRINGTON: No , not anymore , were n't you *listening* ? I nearly had you all , off Tripoli . I would have , if not for the hurricane .
GIBBS: Lord . You did n't try to sail through it ?
NORRINGTON: So do I make your crew , or not ? You have n't said where you 're going . Somewhere *nice* !
JACK SPARROW: You 're hired .
NORRINGTON: Sorry . Old habits and all that . Easy , sonny !
JACK SPARROW: Time to go ?
GIBBS: Aye !
JACK SPARROW: Thanks , mate .
NORRINGTON: Come on , men ! Who wants some ? Form an orderly line , I 'll have you all one y one . Come on , who 's first ?
ELIZABETH SWANN: I just wanted the pleasure of doing that myself !
BO'SUN: Secure the mast tackle , Mister Turner !
WILL TURNER: Step aside !
BO'SUN: ? Regain- ? yourselves ! / ? Mind- ? yourself !
DAVY JONES: Will you now ? And what would prompt such an act of charity ?
BO'SUN: You had it easy , boy ! Ha ha ha !
WILL TURNER: I do n't need your help !
FLYING DUTCHMAN: below deck
WILL TURNER: I 've sworn no oath .
WYVERN: The deadman 's chest .
WILL TURNER: What do you know of this ?
WYVERN: Open the chest with the key , and sta the heart . No-no-no-no . Do n't stab the heart . The Dutchman needs a living heart , or there 'll be no captain . And if there 's no captain , there 's no one to have the key .
WILL TURNER: So the captain has the key .
WYVERN: Hidden .
WILL TURNER: Where is the chest ?
WYVERN: Hidden . Black Pearl
ELIZABETH SWANN: Captain Sparrow !
JACK SPARROW: Come to join me crew , lad ? Welcome aboard .
ELIZABETH SWANN: I 'm here to find the man I love .
JACK SPARROW: I 'm deeply flattered , son , but my first and only love is the sea .
ELIZABETH SWANN: Meaning William Turner , Captain Sparrow .
JACK SPARROW: Elizabeth . Hide the rum .
ELIZABETH SWANN: Jack . I know Will came to find you . Where is he ?
JACK SPARROW: Darling , I am truly unhappy to have
ELIZABETH SWANN: Davy Jones ?
NORRINGTON: Oh , please . The captain of the Flying Dutchman .
JACK SPARROW: You look bloody awful . What are you doing here ?
NORRINGTON: You *hired* me . I ca n't help it if you standards are lax .
JACK SPARROW: You *smell* funny .
ELIZABETH SWANN: Jack . All I want is to find Will .
JACK SPARROW: Are you certain ? Is that what you really want most ?
ELIZABETH SWANN: 'Course .
JACK SPARROW: Because I would think , you 'd want to find a way to *save* Will the most .
ELIZABETH SWANN: And you have a way of doing that ?
JACK SPARROW: Well , there is a chest
NORRINGTON: Oh , dear .
JACK SPARROW: A chest of unknown size and origin .
RAGETTI: Unh-unh unh-unh unh-unh
JACK SPARROW: And whoever possesses that chest possesses the leverage to command Jones to do whatever it is he or she wants , including saving brave William from his grim fate .
NORRINGTON: You do n't actually believe him , do you ?
ELIZABETH SWANN: How do we find it ?
JACK SPARROW: With this . My Compass is unique .
NORRINGTON: `` Unique '' here having the meaning of oken .
JACK SPARROW: True enough . This Compass does not point north .
ELIZABETH SWANN: Where does it point ?
JACK SPARROW: It points to the thing you want most in this world .
ELIZABETH SWANN: Oh Jack ! Are you telling the truth ?
JACK SPARROW: Every word , love . And what you want most in this world is to find the chest of Davy Jones , is it not ?
ELIZABETH SWANN: To save Will ?
JACK SPARROW: By finding the chest of Davy Jones .
GIBBS: Cap ' n .
JACK SPARROW: We have our heading .
GIBBS: Finally ! Cast off those lines , weigh anchor , and prow that canvas !
JACK SPARROW: Miss Swann .

PORT ROYAL: EITC headquarters
MERCER: Most recently seen on the island of Tortuga , then left , in the company of a known pirate , Jack Sparrow . *And* other fugitives from justice .
FLYING DUTCHMAN: deck
MACCUS: I wager ten years .
?KOLENIKO: I 'll match ten years .
GREENBEARD: Agreed .
WILL TURNER: I understand .
DAVY JONES: I accept ? that-uh .
WILL TURNER: My soul . An eternity of servitude .
DAVY JONES: Against ?
WILL TURNER: I want this .
DAVY JONES: How do you know of the key ?
WILL TURNER: That 's not part of the game , is it ? You can still walk away .
DAVY JONES: What 's this ?
WILL TURNER: No ! Do n't do this .
DAVY JONES: Four fours .
WILL TURNER: Four fives .
DAVY JONES: Seven fives-uh .
WILL TURNER: Eight fives .
DAVY JONES: Huh huh huh . Welcome to the crew , liar .
WILL TURNER: Fool . Why did you do that ?
FLYING DUTCHMAN: organ room
WILL TURNER: It 's not a fate you had to choose fo yourself , either .
GIBBS: Beckett !
ELIZABETH SWANN: Yes , they 're signed , Lord Cutler Beckett of the East India Trading Company .
JACK SPARROW: Agh .
GIBBS: Will was working for Beckett , and neve said a word .
JACK SPARROW: Agh .
GIBBS: Beckett wants the Compass . Only one eason for that .
JACK SPARROW: Of course . He wants the chest .
ELIZABETH SWANN: Yes , he did say something about a chest .
GIBBS: If the company controls the chest , they controls the sea .
JACK SPARROW: A truly discomforting notion , love .
GIBBS: And bad . Bad for every mother 's son what calls himself a pirate . I think there 's a bit more speed to be coaxed from these sails . Brace the foreyard !
JACK SPARROW: Might I inquire how as to how you came y these ?
ELIZABETH SWANN: Persuasion .
JACK SPARROW: Friendly ?
ELIZABETH SWANN: Decidedly not .
JACK SPARROW: Will strikes a deal for these and upholds it with honor . Yet you 're the one standing here with the prize . Full pardon , commission as a privateer on behalf of England and the East India Trading Company . As if I could be bought for such a low price .
ELIZABETH SWANN: Jack , the Letters , give them back .
JACK SPARROW: No . Persuade me .
ELIZABETH SWANN: You do know Will taught me how handle a sword .
JACK SPARROW: As I said Persuade me .
NORRINGTON: It 's a curious thing . There was a time when I would 've given anything for you to look like that while thinking about me .
ELIZABETH SWANN: I do n't know what you mean .
NORRINGTON: Oh , I think you do .
ELIZABETH SWANN: Oh , do n't be absurd . I trust him , that 's all .
NORRINGTON: So you never wondered how your *latest* fiancé ended up on the Flying Dutchman in the first place ?
BELLAMY: Strange thing to come upon a longboat so far out in open waters .
WILL TURNER: Just put as many leagues behind us as you can . As fast as you can .
BELLAMY: And what are we running from ?
WILL TURNER: That dress . Where did you get it ?
BELLAMY: It was found aboard the ship . The crew it thought it was a spirit bringing some omen of ill fate .
WILL TURNER: That 's foolish .
QUARTERMASTER: Oh , yes . ? Proceededly foolish .
BURSAR: It brought good fortune ! The spirit told us Put in at Tortuga . And we made a nice bit of profit there .
?BELLAMY: Off the books , of course .
WILL TURNER: I imagine some of your crew may have jumped ship there .
BELLAMY: Why do you ask ?
MESSENGER SAILOR: Captain , a ship 's been spotted .
BELLAMY: Colors ?
MESSENGER SAILOR: She is n't flyin ' any .
BELLAMY: Pirates !
WILL TURNER: Or worse .
FLYING DUTCHMAN: deck
DAVY JONES: You will watch this .
WILL TURNER: I 've doomed us all . It 's the Flying Dutchman !
BURSAR: Oh , Mother Cary 's chickens . What happened ?
?QUARTERMASTER: Must 've hit a reef .
?BELLAMY: Free the rudder ! Hard to port , then hard to starboard !
FLYING DUTCHMAN: deck
MACCUS: The boy 's not here . He must 've been claimed by the sea .
DAVY JONES: *I* am the sea .
KOLENIKO: First ?
DAVY JONES: Who sent that thieving charlatan onto my ship ? Who told them of the key ? Jack Sparrow .
JACK SPARROW: My tremendous intuitive sense of the female creature informs me that you are troubled .
ELIZABETH SWANN: I just thought I 'd be married by now . I 'm so ready to be married .
JACK SPARROW: You know Lizzy I *am* captain of a ship . And *being* captain of a ship , I could in fact perform a marriage . Right here . Right on this deck . Right *now* !
ELIZABETH SWANN: No , thank you .
JACK SPARROW: Why not ? We *are* very much alike , you and I. I and you . Us .
ELIZABETH SWANN: Oh . Except for a sense of honor , and decency and-and a moral center . And personal hygiene .
JACK SPARROW: Trifles . You *will* come over to my side , I know it .
ELIZABETH SWANN: You seem very certain .
JACK SPARROW: One word love curiosity . You long fo freedom . You long to do what you want to do because you want it . To act on selfish impulse . You want to see what it 's like . One day , you wo n't be able to resist .
ELIZABETH SWANN: Why does n't your Compass work ?
JACK SPARROW: Uh my Compass works fine .
ELIZABETH SWANN: Because you and I *are* alike , and there will come a moment when you have a chance to show it . To do the right thing .
JACK SPARROW: I *love* those moments . I like to wave at them as they pass by .
ELIZABETH SWANN: You 'll have the chance to do something something courageous . And when you do , you 'll discover something that you 're a good man .
JACK SPARROW: All evidence to the contrary .
ELIZABETH SWANN: I have faith in you . Want to know why ?
JACK SPARROW: Do tell , dearie .
ELIZABETH SWANN: Curiosity . You 're going to want it . A chance to be admired . And gain the ewards that follow . You wo n't be able to resist . You 're going to want to know what it tastes like .
JACK SPARROW: I *do* want to know what it tastes like .
ELIZABETH SWANN: But - seeing as you 're a good man I know you will *never* put me in a position that would compromise my honor .
?GIBBS: Land ho !
JACK SPARROW: I want my jar of dirt . Longboat
RAGETTI: You 're pulling too slow . We do n't want the Kraken to catch us .
ISLA CRUCES: beach
JACK SPARROW: Guard the boat , mind the tide Do n't touch my dirt .
ELIZABETH SWANN: This does n't work . And it *certainly* does n't show you what you want most .
JACK SPARROW: Yes it *does* . You 're sitting on it !
ELIZABETH SWANN: Beg your pardon ?
JACK SPARROW: Move .
RAGETTI: I ? can/ ? may join the circus !
FLYING DUTCHMAN: deck
DAVY JONES: They 're here . And I can not step foot on land again for near of a decade .
MACCUS: Then trust us to act in your stead .
DAVY JONES: I 'll trust you know what awaits should you *fail* ! Down , then !
MACCUS: Down !
ISLA CRUCES: beach
ELIZABETH SWANN: It 's real !
NORRINGTON: You actually *were* telling the truth .
JACK SPARROW: I do that quite a lot . Yet people are always surprised .
WILL TURNER: With good reason !
ELIZABETH SWANN: Will ! You 're alright ! Thank God ! I came to find you !
JACK SPARROW: How did you get here ?
WILL TURNER: Sea turtles , mate . A pair of them , strapped to my feet .
JACK SPARROW: Not so easy , is it ?
WILL TURNER: But I do owe you thanks , Jack .
JACK SPARROW: You do ?
WILL TURNER: After you tricked me onto that ship to square your debt with Jones .
ELIZABETH SWANN: What ?
JACK SPARROW: What ?
WILL TURNER: I was reunited with my father .
JACK SPARROW: Oh ! Well you 're welcome , then .
ELIZABETH SWANN: Everything you said to me every word , was a lie !
JACK SPARROW: Pretty much . Time and tide , love .
WILL TURNER: I 'm gon na kill Jones .
JACK SPARROW: Ca n't let you do that , William . 'Cause if Jones is dead , who 's to call his terrible beastie off the hunt , eh ? Now . If you please The key .
WILL TURNER: I keep the promises I make , Jack . I intend to free my father . I hope you 're here to see it .
NORRINGTON: I ca n't let you do that , either . So sorry .
JACK SPARROW: I knew you 'd warm up to me eventually .
NORRINGTON: Lord Beckett desires the contents of that chest . I deliver it , and get my life back .
JACK SPARROW: Ah . The dark side of ambition .
NORRINGTON: Oh , I prefer to see it as the promise of redemption .
ELIZABETH SWANN: Stop it ! Be careful !
WILL TURNER: Guard the chest !
ELIZABETH SWANN: *No* !
RAGETTI: Well , each wants the chest for hisself , do n't ' e ? Mister Norrington , I think he 's tryna regain a bit of honor . Old Jack 's lookin ' to trade it , save his own skin . And Turner there - I figure ' e 's tryna settle some unresolved usiness 'twixt him and his twice-cursed pirate father .
ELIZABETH SWANN: Will ! *Enough ! *
NORRINGTON: By your leave , Mister Turner .
ISLA CRUCES: church
WILL TURNER: By *your* leave , Mister Norrington .
NORRINGTON: Do excuse me while I kill the man who uined my life .
WILL TURNER: Be my guest .
JACK SPARROW: Let us examine that claim for a moment , former Commodore , shall we ? Who was it , who at the very moment you had a notorious pirate safely behind bars , saw fit to *free* said pirate , and take your dearly beloved all to hisself , hey ? So who 's fault is it , *really* , that you 've ended up a rum-pot deckhand what takes orders from pirates ?
NORRINGTON: Enough !
JACK SPARROW: Still rooting for you , mate !
ELIZABETH SWANN: Sword !
RAGETTI: Sword !

NORRINGTON: Not with the chest . Into the boat .
ELIZABETH SWANN: You 're mad .
NORRINGTON: Do n't wait for me .
JACK SPARROW: Uh , I say we respect his final wish .
HADRUS: Your bravery is wasted . I shall pry the chest away from your cold dead hands .
NORRINGTON: Here you go !
HADRUS: Oo !
WILL TURNER: What happened to the chest ?
ELIZABETH SWANN: Norrington took it to draw them off .
RAGETTI: You 're not pulling hard enough !
GIBBS: Where 's the Commodore ?
JACK SPARROW: He fell behind .
GIBBS: My prayers be with him . Best not wallow in our grief . The bright side is You 're ack . And made it off free and clear .

DAVY JONES: Send his beloved Pearl back to the depths !
ELIZABETH SWANN: She 's falling behind !
GIBBS: Aye , and we 've got her !
WILL TURNER: We 're the faster ?
GIBBS: Against the wind the Dutchman beats us . That 's how she takes her prey . But *with* the wind
WILL TURNER: We rob her advantage .
GIBBS: Ah !
FLYING DUTCHMAN: deck
DAVY JONES: They 're out of range ! ? Break ? out ? run # # #
?MARTY: They 're giving up ! Yay !
WILL TURNER: My father is *on* that ship . If we can outrun her , we can take her . We should turn and fight .
JACK SPARROW: Why fight when you can negotiate ? All one needs is the proper leverage .
WILL TURNER: No . It 's not a reef ! Get away from the ail !
ELIZABETH SWANN: What is it ?
WILL TURNER: The Kraken . To arms !
?GIBBS: All guns , defend the masts !

GIBBS: Aye ! The rum , too !
ELIZABETH SWANN: Step to !
MARTY: Not good .
WILL TURNER: ? Pull ? away !

MARTY: Did we kill it ?
GIBBS: No . We just made it angry . We 're not out of this yet . Captain ! Orders !
JACK SPARROW: Abandon ship . Into the longboat .
GIBBS: Jack ! The Pearl !
JACK SPARROW: She 's only a ship , mate .
ELIZABETH SWANN: He 's right , we have to head for land .
RAGETTI: That 's a lot o ' wa'er .

RAGETTI: Never another like Captain Jack .
ELIZABETH SWANN: He was a good man .
WILL TURNER: If there was anything could be done to bring him back Elizabeth
TIA DALMA: Would you do it ? Hmmm ? What would you ? Hmmm ? What would *any* of you be willing to do ? Hmmm ? Would you sail to the ends of the eart ' , and beyond , to fetch back ? witty Jack and 'im precious Pearl ?

PITCH BLACK: Screenplay
FRY: Hear me ? Cap ' n ? Some kinda compromise to the hullholding for now , butGoddamn , I 'm glad you 're alive . Got ta pull you E-releaseno , red handle , red handle . I 'll get the warm-ups out while
OWENS: Why did I fall on you ?
FRY: He 's dead . Cap ' n 's dead . Christ , I was looking right at him when
OWENS: I mean , I mean , chrono shows we 're 22 weeks out , so gravity was n't supposed to kick in for another 19 . I mean , I mean , I mean , why did I fall at all ?
FRY: You hear me ? Captain 's dead . Owens too .
OWENS: Oh , no . Not Owens , not . Wai ' , wai ' , wait . I 'm Owens . Right ?
FRY: Cryo-sleep . Swear to God , it sloughs ain cells .
OWENS: Just tell me we 're still in the shipping lane . Just show me all those stars , all those bright , beautiful , deep-space .
FRY: Jesus God .
OWENS: crisis program selected Number Two of
SILENCES ALARMS: more than 1,500-millibars of pressure at surface-level . Okay , so maybe the ship did something right for a change .
OWENS: showing no major water bodiesmaximum terrain , 220 meters over mean surface largely cinder and gypsum with some evaporite deposits .
FRY: Ca n't get my nose downtoo much load ack there .
OWENS: You mean that `` load '' of passengers ?
FRY: So what , we should both go down too ? Out of sheer fucking nobility ?
OWENS: Look , Fry . Company says we 're responsible for every one of those
FRY: Company 's not here , is it ?
OWENS: When captain went down , you stepped up whether you like it or not . Now they train you for this , so
FRY: And there was n't a simulated cockroach alive within 50 clicks of the simulated crash site ! That 's how they train you ! On a fucking simulator ! Owens unbuckles from his chair .
OWENS: Do n't touch that switch !
FRY: I 'm not dying for them . u > She pushes it . But this time
OWENS: 70 seconds ! You still got 70 seconds to level this beast out !
AUDREY: Somethin ' went wrong , huh ?
JOHNS: One chance and you blew it , Riddick . Never cease to disappoint me .
FRY: Carolyn Fry . I 'd shake hands , but
OWENS: Out , out , out , GET IT OUTTA ME !
VOICES: Pull it out of himNo , it 's too close to the heartYou got ta do it , just do it fast . Fry grabs the rod .

PARIS: Well . Our own little slice of heaven .
IMAM: Pleasewhich way to New Mecca ? We must know the direction in order to pray .
JOHNS: Big talk about a scouting party
PARIS: Anyone else having breathing problems ? Aside from me ?
AUDREY: Like I just ran , or something .
SHAZZA: Feel one lung short . All of us .
PARIS: Well , I tend toward the asthmatic . And with all this dust .
FRY: It 's the atmosphere . Too much pressure , not enough oxygen . Might take a few days to
ZEKE: So what the bloody hell happened , anyways ?
FRY: Somethin ' knocked us off-lane . Maybe a ogue comet . Maybe we 'll never know .
SHAZZA: Well , I for one , am thoroughly fucking grateful . This beast was n't made to land like this . But cripes , you rode it down . C'mon , you lousy ingrates , only reason we 're alive is a'cuzza her .
FRY: Liquid oxygen canisters inside . Start ipping them out . Quick hits only try to make it last .
AUDREY: Well , is someone coming for us ? Or are we all just gon na die of exposure o dehydration or sunstroke or maybe even something worse ? Hey , you do n't have to worry about scaring me .
SHAZZA: We 're worried you 'll scare us . Name 's `` Audrey , '' right , love ? And you 're goin ' to Taurus Three like we were ?
AUDREY: Yeah , butdo we even have enough food to get there ? Or will we have to resort to cannibalism ?
ZEKE: I 'll see 'bout makin ' this air go a bit further , cap ' n . With your permission , a ' course .
FRY: And him ?
JOHNS: Big Evil ?
FRY: We just keep him locked up forever ?
JOHNS: Be my choice . Already escaped once from the max-slam facility on
FRY: I do n't need his life story . Is he really that dangerous ?
JOHNS: Only around humans .
FRY: Oh , Christ .
PARIS: Mine here .
FRY: S'matter ?
JOHNS: Little swamp-flu from the Conga system . Never shook it with all this cryo-sleep . Paris opens his container to reveal
PARIS: Be surprised what these will fetch in the Taurus system . Here . This Wooten here easy , easy . Very rare .
PARIS: 200-year-old single-malt scotch is to `` booze '' as foie gras is to `` duck guts . ''
JOHNS: A toast to whatever he just said .
PARIS: I 'll need a receipt for that . For all these .
FRY: Top of my list .
IMAM: One of the Christian habits we did n't < /u adopt perhaps unfortunately . We 'll have to wait .
JOHNS: For what ? There is no water . You understand that , do n't you ?
IMAM: All deserts have water , somewhere . God shall lead us there .
JOHNS: Like we needed another way to die .
PARIS: Maratha crow-bill war-picks from Northern India . Very rare .
ZEKE: An ' this ?
PARIS: Blow-dart hunting stick from Papua New
ZEKE: 'Cuz they could n't hunt shit with these things , be my guess .
PARIS: Well , what 's the need , anyway ? If he 's gone , he 's gone . Why should he bother us ?
JOHNS: First , because he can only live out there for so long he 's gon na come back and take what we got . Second , for the shee thrill of the kill . A beat . They all grab for weapons .
FRY: Imam . We should leave soon . Before nightfall but while it 's cooler .
ZEKE: What , you 're goin ' off , too ?
FRY: Johns is leaving you a gun . Just do me a favor , huh ? Get my crewies buried ? They were good guys who died bad .
SHAZZA: A'course we will .
AUDREY: Three suns ?
ZEKE: So much for your nightfall .
PARIS: So much for my cocktail hour .
IMAM: We take this to be a good sign a path , a direction from God . Johns swings down from the top of the ship .
JOHNS: A very good sign . That 's Riddick 's direction . You do not < /u wan na be caught in the dark with this guy .
FRY: Thought you found his restraints ove there . Toward sunset .
JOHNS: Which means he went toward sunrise .
FRY: So quiet . You get used to the sounds of the ship , then .
IMAM: You know who Muhammad was ?
FRY: Some prophet guy ?
IMAM: `` Some prophet guy . '' And a city man . But he had to travel to the desert where there was quiet to hear the words of God .
FRY: You were on a pilgrimage ? To New Mecca ?
IMAM: Chrislam teaches that once in every lifetime should there be a great hajj a great pilgrimage . To know God , better , yes , but to know yourself as well .
FRY: Frightening thought .
IMAM: We 're all on the same hajj now . Fry notices Johns scope-locked on something .
FRY: What ?
JOHNS: Tell me it 's not a mirage .
FRY: Trees ?
PARIS: Amazing how you can do without the essentials of life so long as you have the luxuries .
ZEKE: Well , just keep your bloody-fuckin ' eyes open . Do n't want that ratbag sneakin ' up on me bloody-fuckin ' arse .
AUDREY: He 'd probably get you right here , right under the jaw . And you 'd never hear him coming . That 's how good Riddick is . Paris eases the hunting boomerang away .
PARIS: Now did you run away from your parents ? Or did they run away from you ?
PILGRIMS: Allahu AkbarAllahu Akbar .
FRY: Is this whole planet dead ? A pilgrim questions Imam IN ARABIC .
IMAM: He asks what could have killed so many great things
JOHNS: Long time ago . Whatever happened .
PILGRIM #1: Ah .
FRY: Probably makes it worse . Dehydrates you even more .
JOHNS: Probably right .
FRY: Better keep moving .
JOHNS: What 'd Owens mean ? 'Bout not touching the switch ?
FRY: Promise me . Swear to me you wo n't
JOHNS: You see anybody else here ? Just between you and me .
FRY: During the landingwhen things were at their worstOwens was at his best . He 's the one who would n't let the pilot dump the passenger cabin .
JOHNS: Hold up .
FRY: What ?
JOHNS: Thought he might be coolin ' it in the oneyard could either double-back to the ship or slip in behind us . So I left the bottle out as bait .
PILGRIM #1: Captaincaptain .
FRY: Wait , wait , wait .
IMAM: We are not alone here , yes ?
JOHNS: Never thought we were .
PILGRIM #1: Assalamoo ahlaykum !
PILGRIM #2: Assalamoo ahlaykum !
JOHNS: Long gone . Whoever they were .
IMAM: Waterwater there was here .
PILGRIMS: Allahu Akbar .
IMAM: `` God is Great , '' yes ?
JOHNS: I 'm born-again .
FRY: Lights .
JOHNS: Hey . Do n't go too far , huh ?
FRY: No darkness . No lights because no darkness .
PARIS: This now qualifies as the worst fun I 've ever had . Stop it . No response .
AUDREY: Okay , it was me . What 'd I do now ?
PARIS: Assailing my fragile sense of security , that 's what .
SHAZZA: What 're you goin ' on about ? She 's been ight here for the last .
AUDREY: No !
TOTAL STRANGER: I thoughtmy God , I thought I was the only one who .
PARIS: Oh , Lord .
AUDREY: It was just somebody else . From the crash . He was just .
ZEKE: Cripes galore , I thought it was him . The murderin ' ratbag . I thought he was .
FRY: No juice , looks like it 's been laid up for years . But we might be able to adapt
JOHNS: Shut up . Outside , Johns has an ear cocked to the wind .
FRY: Like what ?
JOHNS: Like my pistola .
ZEKE: Now what the bloody hell .
JOHNS: Same crap , different planet , huh ?
FRY: Ease up , ease up . JOHNS ! Just tell me what .
SHAZZA: What 'd you do with 'im ? You bloody sick animal you , what'dja do with me Zeke ?
FRY: He used that ?
JOHNS: Sir Shiv-a-lot . He likes to cut .
FRY: So why is n't it all bloody ?
JOHNS: I assume he licked it clean .
FRY: So where is he ?
RIDDICK: 'Mean the whispers ?
FRY: What whispers ?
RIDDICK: The ones tellin ' me to go for the sweet spot just to the left of the spine , fourth lumbar down . The abdominal aorta . What a gusher . Had a cup on his belt , so I used it to catch a little run-off . Metallic taste to it , human blood . Coppery . But if you cut it with peppermint schnapps , that goes away . Course , that 's more for winter . Summertime , I take mine straight .
FRY: Why do n't we try the truth now ? A head-shaking beat , then
RIDDICK: All you people are so scared of me an ' most days , I 'd take that as a compliment but it ai n't me you got ta worry about now .
FRY: Show me your eyes .
RIDDICK: Slam doctor . Well , we called him `` doctor . ''
FRY: Heard about it . Just never seen it .
RIDDICK: Fairly fuckin ' ironic , would n't you say ? Slamlight 's so dim that you go and get your eyeballs taken out and shined up then you wind up here . Three ass-kick suns . Maybe I did do a few people . But not this one . No ma'am , not this time .
FRY: Then where is he ? He 's not in the hole . We looked .
RIDDICK: Look deeper . He CLICKS HIS TONGUE at her .
FRY: Let 's just be sure .
JOHNS: Well , do n't ask me to .
FRY: Thought you did n't believe his story .
JOHNS: I do n't . But that ground looked none too stable , and I do n't want anyone
AUDREY: If you 're afraid , I 'll go . He shoots Audrey a scowl .
FRY: Nobody else is going down but me , okay ?
JOHNS: Hey . Bein ' ballsy with your life now does n't change what came before it 's just stupid .
FRY: What , you think I 'm doin ' this to prove something ?
JOHNS: You said it , not me . Let 's just not let one bad call lead to another .
FRY: Thanks for the tip , Johns . i > '' Now get outta my way . `` < /i
IMAM: Did you hear .
FRY: I 'm over here in the Something tugs on her chain .
JOHNS: We got youit 's okay , it 's okaywe got you now .
IMAM: The child heard you before any of us could even .
SHAZZA: Did you find him ? You find Zeke ?
FRY: was n't Riddickit wasit was goddamn , that was stupid.but was n't Riddick . Somethin ' else down there that got Zeke and nearly got
IMAM: One is all ?
FRY: For now .
RIDDICK: Found somethin ' worse than me , huh ?
JOHNS: We 're movin ' . And I 'm just wondering if I should n't lighten the load right now .
RIDDICK: Woof , woof .
JOHNS: Want you to remember this moment , Riddick . The way it coulda gone and did n't .
RIDDICK: Say that again .
JOHNS: Here 's the deal . You work without the chains , without the bit without the shivs . You help us get off this rock .
RIDDICK: For what ? The honor of goin ' back to some asshole of a cell ?
JOHNS: Truth is , Riddick , I 'm tired of this head-up shit . I wan na be free of you as much as you wan na be free of me .
RIDDICK: You 'd cut me loose , Boss ?
JOHNS: Only if we both get outta this alive . And there may be a way .
RIDDICK: My recommendation Do me . Do n't take the chance that I 'll get shiv-happy on your wannabe ass . Ghost me , Riddick . Would if I were you .
JOHNS: If you were me , I 'd kill us both . C'mon , you wan na sit at the grown-up table or not ?
RIDDICK: Want you to remember this moment .
PARIS: So just like that . Wave your little wand and he 's one of us now .
JOHNS: Did n't say that . But least this way I do n't have to worry about falling asleep and not wakin ' up .
IMAM: Well , I feel we owe Mr. Riddick amends .
SHAZZA: Oh , right . Let 's all line up and beg his forgiveness . Right you are .
IMAM: At least give the man some oxygen .
JOHNS: He 's happy just bein ' vertical . Leave him e .
AUDREY: So I can talk to him now ?
PARIS: Paris P. Ogilvie . Antiquities dealer , entrepreneur .
RIDDICK: Richard B. Riddick . Escaped convict , murderer .
PARIS: You know , if I owned Hell and this planetI believe I 'd rent this out and live in Hell .
JOHNS: Little ratty-ass .
FRY: Nothing we ca n't repair so long as the electrical adapts .
SHAZZA: Not a star-jumper .
RIDDICK: Does n't need to be . Use this to get back up to the Sol-Track Shipping Lanes , stick out a thumb . You 'll get picked up . Right ?
FRY: Little help here ?
JOHNS: Check those containers for me . See what we can patch wings with .
FRY: Okay , that should buy us a sys-check . But we 'll need more cells .
JOHNS: How many ?
FRY: 15 6-gigs here90 gigs totalothe ship carries 20-gig cells , sofive . Five total to launch .
JOHNS: 25 kilos each , huh ?
SHAZZA: Old sand-cat outside . See if I ca n't get it up and chuggin ' .
JOHNS: Do it . And if you need an extra hand , tap our problem child out . Where 's Riddick ?
ROBOT: `` to all intruders . I am the guardian of this land . I will protect my masters at all cost . Death to all intruders ''
RIDDICK: Missin ' the party . C'mon . He leaves . HOLD on the trash bin a beat .
IMAM: and for this , our gift of drink , we give thanks in the name of our Prophet , Muhammad , peace be upon him , and to ou Lord , Jesus Christ of Nazareth , and to his father , Allah the Compassionate and the Merciful .
PARIS: The strangest religion .
SHAZZA: Looks like geologists . Advance team , moves around from rock to rock .
JOHNS: Musta crapped out here , huh ?
AUDREY: But why did they leave their ship ?
JOHNS: Well , just a skiff . Disposable , really .
PARIS: Like an emergency life-raft , right ?
SHAZZA: Sure . Coulda had a real drop-ship take them off-planet . Long gone .
PARIS: A toast to their ghosts , then . Goblets rise .
RIDDICK: Did n't leave , these people . Whatever got Zeke got them . They 're all dead . It 's like he just pissed in the punchbowl .
SHAZZA: Maybe they had weight limits , you do n't know .
RIDDICK: I know you do n't uncrate your emergency ship unless there 's a fucking emergency .
JOHNS: Rag it , Riddick . Nobody wants you theories on
FRY: So what happened ? Where are they , then ?
IMAM: Has anyone seen the young one ? Ali ?
RIDDICK: Has anyone checked the coring room ?
IMAM: Ali .
SHAZZA: Why was the door chained up ? Why the loody hell would they lock themselves in like that ?
JOHNS: Not sure , but tell you what Chrislams etter not be diggin ' another grave out there .
SHAZZA: So that 's what come of me Zeke . An ' you saw it . You was right there . Riddick nods .
RIDDICK: Just wanted his O-2 . Though I notice he tried to ghost my ass . When he shot up that stranger instead .
SHAZZA: Take it .
RIDDICK: What , it 's broken ?
SHAZZA: Startin ' to acclimate , anyhow . Take it .
JOHNS: Let 's board this up and get the hell gone . They seem to stick to the dark , so if we stick to daylight , should be all
FRY: 60 years ago .
JOHNS: Wha ' ?
FRY: Core-samples are dated . Last one is 60 years ago . This month .
SHAZZA: Yeah ? What 's special about that ?
FRY: Dunno . Maybe nothing , but . But now Fry remembers
JOHNS: Are you fuckin ' kidding me ?
RIDDICK: Not afraid of the dark , are you ?
FRY: need those cells from the crash ship . Shit , still got ta check out the hull , patch the wings
JOHNS: Let 's wait on the power cells .
FRY: Wait for what ? Until it 's so dark we ca n't even find our way back to
JOHNS: Ever tell you how Riddick escaped ?
FRY: He can pilot ?
JOHNS: Hijacked a prison transport , made a helluva good run 'fore I tracked him down .
JOHNS: He also figured out how to kill the pilot , Fry . A mental shiver .
FRY: You said we were going to trust him now . You said there was a deal .
JOHNS: That 's what I said . He challenges her to read his mind .
FRY: Oh , this is a dangerous game you 're playing , Johns .
JOHNS: May 've noticed chains do n't work on this guy . Only way we 're truly safe is if he
FRY: You mean , if he learns that you 're gon na oyally fuck him over .
JOHNS: He 's a murderer . The law says he 's got ta do his bid . Shaking her head , she looks off .
FRY: Dancin ' on razor blades here
JOHNS: I wo n't give him a chance to grab anothe ship or to slash another pilot 's throat .
RIDDICK: Bad sign . Shakin ' like that in this heat .
FRY: They 're coming .
RIDDICK: Strange , not doin ' a run-up on the main drive yet . Strange unless he told you the particulars of my escape .
FRY: I got the quick-and-ugly version .
RIDDICK: An ' now you 're worried about a repeat of history ?
FRY: Entered our minds .
RIDDICK: I asked what you thought .
FRY: You scare me , Riddick . That 's what you wan na hear , is n't it ? There , I admit it , Can I get back to work now ?
RIDDICK: Think Johns is an do-right man ? You think I can trust him to cut me loose ?
FRY: Why , what 'd you hear ?
RIDDICK: Well , guess if it was trickeration he 'd just do me , huh ? Then againI am worth twice as much alive . Did n't know ? Johns ai n't a cop . Oh , he 's got that shiny badge an ' all , but nah he 's just a merc and I 'm just a payday . That 's why he wo n't kill me . The creed is greed . It knocks her off stride , but
FRY: Save it , Riddick . We are n't gon na turn on each other no matter how hard you try . Riddick moves right up behind her .
RIDDICK: I do n't truly know what 's gon na happen when the lights go out , Carolyn but I do know that once the dyin ' starts , this little psycho family of ours is gon na rip itself apart . So you better find out the truth . Come nightfall , you better know exactly who 's standing behind you .
JOHNS: I never said I was .
FRY: Never said you were a hype , either .
JOHNS: You have a little caffeine in the morning , I have a little morphine . So what ?
FRY: And here you got two mornings every day . Wow , were you born lucky ?
JOHNS: Not a problem unless you 're gon na make
JOHNS: Owens was already dead . His brain just had n't caught on to that fact .
JOHNS: My first run-in with Riddick . Went fo the sweet-spot and missed . They had to leave a piece of the shiv in there . I can feel it , sometimes , pressing against the cord . So maybe the care and feeding of my nerve-endings is my business .
FRY: You coulda helped . And you did n't .
JOHNS: Yeah , well , look to thine own ass first . Right , `` captain '' ? It cuts deep .
PARIS: What do my eyes see ?
FRY: It 's starting .
SHAZZA: If we need anything from the crash ship I suggest we kick on . That sand-cat 's solar .
FRY: LET 'S GET THOSE CELLS !
SHAZZA: We stay together ! C'mon !
RIDDICK: Do n't wan na miss this .
AUDREY: Lookit . Lookit !
FRY: Do n't stop , do n't stop .
JOHNS: Jesus , how many can there .
PARIS: Just a suggestion , but perhaps we should flee .
FRY: Cargo hold , everyone in the cargo hold . lesgo , lesgo , lesgo .
AUDREY: Tell her to stay there . Stay down .
FRY: No , no , NO , NO , NO .
RIDDICK: Like I said . Ai n't me you got ta worry about .
AUDREY: What ifwhat if she 's still out there still alive .
JOHNS: Well , I do n't want to jump to conclusions herebut 'member that boneyard ? These just might be the fuckers that killed every other living thing on this planet , okay ? Chances of Shazza knockin ' on that door anytime soon are just about zero squared .
FRY: I saw the cut-marks on the bones . Was n't a natural die-off .
IMAM: Quiet , please . Everyone .
AUDREY: Why do they do that ? Make that sound ?
IMAM: Perhaps the way they see . With sound , eflecting back .
FRY: Echo-location . That 's what it is .
JOHNS: I 'd rather piss glass .
RIDDICK: Well , you got the big gauge .
JOHNS: Wan na rag your fat mouth ?
AUDREY: Maybe it 's just their beads again . Imam , are you still
IMAM: No , no , no , I do not believe
JOHNS: C'mon , man , you 're drivin ' everybody ugfuck with those things . Why do n't you just lose the goddamn .
RIDDICK: Big beads .
JOHNS: Okay . We 're okay . Just some small ones that musta
PARIS: Not staying in here another .
FRY: Christ , you do n't know what 's out there !
PARIS: I know what 's in here !
IMAM: Everybody come , this way and we should be safe . Hurry , please .
RIDDICK: Can you do sumpin ' else with that ? 'Sides holding it in my fucking face ?
PARIS: Hello , hello ?
RIDDICK: Do n't . Move .
FRY: Imam ? Where are they ?
RIDDICK: No .
FRY: Stop it , stop it , STOP IT !
JOHNS: 'Sokay , 'sokay . I killed it .
FRY: There .
PARIS: Like the light is scalding it .
FRY: It hurts them . Light actually hurts them .
IMAM: Is thatHasan ? Riddick nods .
JOHNS: We 'll burn a candle for him later . C'mon .
FRY: one cutting torchone handlight here , two more in the cabinI think two more .
PARIS: Spirits . Anything over 45 proof burns well .
FRY: How many bottles ?
PARIS: Not sure . Ten ?
FRY: Those umbrellas , the ones that mist . Would they burn ? If you got a receipt ?
PARIS: Possibly .
FRY: Awright . So maybe we 'll have enough light .
JOHNS: Enough for what ?
FRY: We can stick to the plan . If we get fou cells back to the skiff , we 're off this ock .
PARIS: I hate to kill a beautiful theory with an ugly fact , but that sand-cat wo n't run at night .
FRY: We 'll have to carry the cellsdrag themwhatever it takes .
AUDREY: You meantonight ? With all those things still out there ?
PARIS: Oh , sure . Why not ? Sounds like a hoot .
JOHNS: Back it up . How long can this last ? Few minutes ? Couple hours ? No one knows for sure .
IMAM: I had the impressionfrom the model that the two planets were moving as one . That there would bea lasting darkness .
FRY: I 'm sure that 's what someone else said . Locked inside that coring room .
JOHNS: Look , we got ta think about everyone now the kid especially . How scared is she gon na be out there ?
FRY: Oh , do n't use her like that , for a smoke screen .
JOHNS: Smoke screen for what ?
FRY: For your own fear .
JOHNS: Hey . Why do n't you rag your hole for two seconds and let someone else come up with a plan that does n't involve MASS SUICIDE ? Two seconds pass .
FRY: How much you weigh , Johns ?
JOHNS: What the hell 's it matter ?
FRY: How much ?
JOHNS: 79 kilos .
FRY: Because you 're 79 kilos of gutless white meat , and that 's why you ca n't come up with a better plan .
RIDDICK: Think about that reward , Johns .
JOHNS: I 'm willing to take a cut in pay .
RIDDICK: How 'bout a cut in your gut ?
JOHNS: Oh , Trash Baby , you 're gon na regret this .
IMAM: Pleasethis solves nothingplease .
FRY: They 're afraid of our light . That means we do n't have to be so afraid of them .
IMAM: And you 're certain you can find the way ack ? Even in the dark ?
FRY: No , I 'm not . But he can . She 's pointing , of course , to Riddick .
RIDDICK: Looks clear .
JOHNS: Fuck me . You said `` clear . ''
RIDDICK: Said `` looks clear . ''
JOHNS: Well , what 's it look like now ?
RIDDICK: Looks clear .
FRY: Just get the goddamn lights on .
JOHNS: He 'll lead you over the first cliff . You know that , do n't you ?
FRY: We 're just burnin ' light here .
JOHNS: You give him the cells and the ship and he will leave you . He will leave you all out there to die .
FRY: I do n't get it , Johns . What is so goddamn valuable in your life that you 're worried about losing ? Huh ? Is there anything at all ? Besides your next hype ? Got no right to be so scared . Neither one of us .
RIDDICK: Be runnin ' about 10 paces ahead . I want light on my back but not in my eyes . And check your cuts . These things know our blood now .
FRY: Riddickwas thinkin ' we should make some kind of deal . Just in case , you know , this actually
RIDDICK: Had it with deals .
FRY: But I just wanted to say
RIDDICK: Nobody 's gon na turn a murderer loose . I fuckin ' knew better .
FRY: We can , ca n't we ? Trust you ?
RIDDICK: Actually That 's what I been askin ' myself .
JOHNS: So you noticed too ?
FRY: Riddick . Riddick .
RIDDICK: Saw something I did n't like .
JOHNS: Such as .
RIDDICK: Hard to tell , sometimeseven for me ut looked like a bunch of those big boys chewin ' each other 's gonads off . Thought we 'd swing wide . Okay by you ?
FRY: Let 's move . Just a detour . He 'll get us there .
PARIS: Can we switch ?
FRY: What , switch what ?
PARIS: I think I twisted my ankle running ackwards like that . And I 'm not sure I can . Okay , that 's a lie . I just do n't want to e alone back there anymore . If you could just give me a few minutes up front here
JOHNS: She 's the pilot , she should stay close to the cells .
PARIS: Oh , so I 'm disposable ?
FRY: I 'll switch , I 'll switch ! Christ , just get this train moving !
PARIS: Light , please , need light here .
IMAM: Pleasehave we been cut ? Can someone tell me if .
PARIS: Oh , sweet Jesus . The bottle drops . The blood flows . The CLICKING STOPS .
FRY: What do you see ? Riddick ?
RIDDICK: Hunger . I see 60 years of hunger .
FRY: Bottle-count .
AUDREY: Four fulls , one half . That mean we 're halfway there ? I hope ?
FRY: Can we pick up the pace ?
JOHNS: We are n't completely stupid .
FRY: Stay in the light ! Everybody ! Stay in the fucking
IMAM: We crossed our own tracks .
JOHNS: He 's running us 'round in circles . Look for yourself . Look !
FRY: Riddick ? What the hell are you
RIDDICK: Listen .
FRY: Think about what ?
JOHNS: About how to kill us and still get these cells to the skiff . Goddamnit , we 're just doin ' the heavy lifting for this prick !
RIDDICK: About the girl .
FRY: What about her ?
RIDDICK: What it 's gon na be like when we hit that canyon . With her bleeding .
JOHNS: What 're you jaw-jackin ' about ? Girl 's not cut .
RIDDICK: No . She 's not .
AUDREY: I did n't want you to leave me there ack at the shipthat 's why I did n't say anything .
FRY: No , we 'd never.Oh , God , honey , you shoulda told me sooner .
JOHNS: Aw , this ca n't be happening to me .
RIDDICK: They been nose-open for her ever since we left . They go off blood .
IMAM: Wellwe must keep her close , then . Here , she 'll be safe if we put he etween
RIDDICK: There is no `` safe . ''
FRY: It 's not gon na work . We got ta go back . Johns brays .
FRY: I was wrong . I admit it . My bad , okay ? Now let 's just go back to the ship .
JOHNS: I dunno . Nice breeze , wide open spaces you know , I 'm startin ' to enjoy myself out here .
FRY: Are you fucking high again ? Just listen to
JOHNS: No , no , you 're right , Fry . What 's to be afraid of ? My life is a steamin ' pile of meaningless toadshit anyhow . So I say mush on ! Canyon 's only couple hundred meters , after that we 're in Skiff City ! So why do n't you just butch up , stuff a cork in that kid , and get
IMAM: She 's the captain , we should listen to
AUDREY: What 's he talkin ' about ?
JOHNS: During the crash , she
FRY: This does not help us , Johns .
JOHNS: she tried to blow the whole fucking passenger cabin , tried to kill us
FRY: Just shut up , okay ?
JOHNS: tried to kill us in our sleep . Paris
FRY: Would you RAG YOUR STUPID HOLE !
JOHNS: We 're not alive because of her we 're alive in spite of her .
FRY: We can not go through there .
JOHNS: How much you weigh right now , Fry ? Huh ?
IMAM: Fine , fine , you 've made your point . We can all be so scared as you . Johns snatches a light away from Imam .
JOHNS: Verdict 's in . The light moves forward .
RIDDICK: Just realized that , huh ?
JOHNS: Six of us left . If we could get through that canyon and lose just one , that 'd be quite a fucking feat , huh ? A good thing , ight ?
RIDDICK: Not if I 'm the one .
JOHNS: What if you 're one of five ? Riddick stares . `` I 'm listening . `` < /i
AUDREY: What 're they doin ' up there ?
IMAM: Talking about the canyon , I suppose . How to get us through .
JOHNS: Look , it 's hellified stuff but no different than those battlefield doctors when they have to decide who lives and who dies . It 's called `` triage , '' okay ?
RIDDICK: Kept calling it `` murder '' when I did it .
JOHNS: Either way , figure it 's something you can grab onto .
RIDDICK: Sacrifice play . Hack up one body , leave it at start of the canyon . Like a bucket of chum .
JOHNS: Trawl with it . There 's a cable on the sled . We can drag the body behind us .
RIDDICK: Nice embellishment .
JOHNS: Do n't wan na feed these land-sharks just keep 'em off our scent .
RIDDICK: So which one caught your eye ?
JOHNS: Don ' look , don ' look , don ' look .
FRY: Imam . Slow down .
IMAM: What ?
FRY: Do n't stop , just slow down . Little more space 'tween us and them .
IMAM: I would rather we all stay
FRY: Do what I say . Please .
RIDDICK: What 's her name , anyway ?
JOHNS: What do you care ? Riddick shrugs . `` I do n't . `` < /i
RIDDICK: What , you 'spect me to do it ?
RIDDICK: Oh , you 're a piece of art , Johns . They oughtta hang you in a museum somewhere . Or forget the museum maybe they should just hang you .
JOHNS: Awright . You do the girl , I 'll keep the others off your back . Riddick stops . Reconsiders .
RIDDICK: Just wonderin ' if we do n't need a bigge piece of chum .
JOHNS: Like who , Mr. Chrislam ?
FRY: Bring the light !
AUDREY: What 're they doing ? What 're we
FRY: Leave the sled , let 's go , go , go !
RIDDICK: Got ta stay in the light , Johns . That 's the only rule .
FRY: Get out of our way .
RIDDICK: So everybody huddles together till the lights burn out ? Until you ca n't see what 's eating you ? That the big plan ?
IMAM: Where 's Mr. Johns ?
RIDDICK: Which half ?
IMAM: You mean .
AUDREY: Gon na lose everybody out here .
RIDDICK: He died fast . And if we got any choice , that 's the way we should all go out . Do n't you cry for Johns . Do n't you dare .
FRY: How many you see ?
RIDDICK: One or two .
FRY: Audrey ?
AUDREY: Three full bottles . But almost time to efill .
FRY: Does n't seem like enough to turn back on , does it ?
RIDDICK: Only see one way . Turn the sled over and drag it like that , girl down low . Light up everything we got and run through like dogs on fire . A beat .
IMAM: The sled as a shield .
FRY: And what about the cells ?
RIDDICK: I 'll take those . She looks at him hard .
FRY: We 're just here to carry your light , are n't we ? Just the torch-bearers .
RIDDICK: Let 's drop back an ' boot up .
IMAM: Blessing you like the others . It 's painless .
RIDDICK: And pointless .
IMAM: I see . Well , even if you do n't believe in God , it does n't mean He wo n't be
RIDDICK: You do n't see .
IMAM: He will be with us . Nonetheless .
RIDDICK: Give my blessing to the girl . She needs a spare .
FRY: You sure you can keep
RIDDICK: As fast as you can .
IMAM: `` So dark the clouds around my way I can not see , But through the darkness I believe God leadeth me . I gladly place my hand in His when all is dim , And , closing my weary eyes , lean hard on him . ''
FRY: Riddick ? RIDDICK ?
AUDREY: What ? What is it ?
RIDDICK: It 's a fucking staircase ! Go over it !
FRY: Audrey !
RIDDICK: Did n't know who he was fuckin ' with .
IMAM: Suleiman !
RIDDICK: Get the girl back under . Keep going .
IMAM: SULEIMAN !
RIDDICK: KEEP GOING OR I WILL !
FRY: Oh , no . No , no , no .
IMAM: Rain .
RIDDICK: So where the hell 's God now , huh ? I 'll tell you where ! He 's up there
FRY: Riddick ? How close ?
RIDDICK: We ca n't make it .
AUDREY: Why 's he still out there ?
FRY: There 's light in here .
IMAM: Larva .
AUDREY: Glow worms .
FRY: How many bottles we got ? Empty ones ?
AUDREY: More , more , we need more .
RIDDICK: Strong survival instinct . Admire that in a woman .
FRY: You 're not leaving . Not until we go back for the others . He laughs at that .
RIDDICK: Think you 've mistaken me for somebody who gives a fuck .
FRY: What , you 're afraid ?
RIDDICK: Confusin ' me with Johns now fear was u > his monkey . I only deal in life and death . All that stuff in between ? Some shade of grey my eyes do n't see .
FRY: I trusted you , Riddick . Goddamn , I trusted that some part of you wanted to ejoin the human race .
RIDDICK: Truthfully ? I would n't know how .
FRY: Then wait for me . I 'll go back myself . Just give me more light for them . He tosses her a light . The broken one .
RIDDICK: Got a better idea . Come with me . Fry 's mouth moves but nothing comes out .
FRY: You 're fuckin ' with me . I know you are .
RIDDICK: 'Course I am but does n't mean I wo n't leave you here . If you believe anything about me , better be that .
FRY: No , you see , I promised themI have toI have to go and .
RIDDICK: Step aboard , Carolyn .
FRY: I can't.I ca n't .
RIDDICK: Here . Make it easy on you .
FRY: Do n't do this to me .
RIDDICK: Just give me your hand .
FRY: But theythey could still be .
RIDDICK: No one 's gon na blame you . C'mon . Take my hand and save yourself , Carolyn .
FRY: I will not give up on them ! I Will not leave anyone on this rock with those fucking things , even if it means
RIDDICK: You 'd die for them ?
FRY: I would try for them .
RIDDICK: You barely know them .
FRY: But I 'm human . I know you view that as a
AUDREY: You came for us .
RIDDICK: Yeah , yeah we 're all fuckin ' amazed . Anyone not ready for this ?
FRY: I do n't hear He covers her mouth .
RIDDICK: Does n't see uswait for it to leave .
IMAM: Captain .
FRY: It 's me , it 's me , it 's me !
RIDDICK: Not for me .
AUDREY: Not sure where to go . I was just runnin ' away when this whole thing started . Where you goin ' ?
RIDDICK: Not sure . I was just runnin ' away when this whole thing .
IMAM: New Mecca .
RIDDICK: Think a soul could get lost there ? With all those pilgrim-types ?
IMAM: It 's more a place where souls are found , Mr. Riddick .
SHOOTING SCRIPT: May 5 , 1967
ASTRONAUT'S VOICE: So ends my last signal until we reach our destination . We are now on automatic , a mere hundred and five light years from our base and at the mercy of com- puters . I 've tucked in my crew for the long sleep . I 'll join them presently .
ASTRONAUT: Within the hour we shall complete the sixth month of our flight from Cape Kennedy . By our time , that is He pauses , looking up at
ASTRONAUT'S VOICE: But according to Dr. Hasslein theory of time in a vehicle traveling at close to the speed of light , old Mother Earth has aged a few thousand years since our de- parture while we have scarcely aged at all .
TAYLOR: It may be so . This much is probable the men who sent us on this journey have long since been moldering in forgotten graves ; and those , if any , who read this message are a different breed . Hopefully , a etter one . He begins to roll up his left sleeve .
TAYLOR'S VOICE: You all right ? They nod .
TAYLOR: Stewart ? Stewart ?
TAYLOR'S VOICE: We 're in the soup . We 're sinking .
TAYLOR: Dodge ! Read the atmosphere !
LANDON: What signal ?
TAYLOR: To Earth ! That we 've landed !
DODGE: It 's breathable .
TAYLOR'S VOICE: Okay ! Blow the hatch before we lose auxilliary power .
LANDON: It 's no use there she goes .
TAYLOR: Forget it . Abandon ship .
DODGE: Brinytwenty-five percent salinity . Near the saturation point .
LANDON: She 's still sinking
LANDON'S VOICE: Going going The craft vanishes beneath the water .
LANDON: Gone .
TAYLOR: We 're here to stay .
LANDON: Well ? Where are we ? Have any notion , skipper ?
TAYLOR: We 're some three hundred and twenty light years from Earth . On an unnamed planet in orbit around a star in the constellation of Orion . That could be Bellatrix .
DODGE'S VOICE: Too red for Bellatrix .
LANDON: You did n't have time to check the tapes , so you do n't really know , do you ? What went wrong ? We were n't programmed to land in water .
DODGE: The question , Landon , is not so much where we are as when we are .
TAYLOR: We 've had a nice snooze . Let 's start earning all our back pay .
DODGE: Yo !
TAYLOR: Geiger counter ?
DODGE: Yo !
TAYLOR: One pistol twenty-four rounds of ammo . two medical kits.. one camera one TX9 . We 've enough food and water for three days .
DODGE: But how long is a day ?
TAYLOR: Good question . Landon check your communications kit .
LANDON: Sorry I was thinking of Stewart . What d'you suppose happened ?
TAYLOR: Air leak . Died in her sleep .
LANDON: You do n't seem very cut up about it .
TAYLOR: It 's a little late for a wake . She 's een dead nearly a year .
LANDON: Then we 've been away from Earth fo eighteen months .
TAYLOR: By our time . You 've turned gray .
LANDON: long pause ) You know it .
TAYLOR: Because time has wiped out everyone and everything you cared for they 're dust .
LANDON: Prove it . If we ca n't get back , it 's still just a theory .
TAYLOR: It 's a fact , Landon . Buy it . You 'll sleep etter .
DODGE: Nothing will grow here . there 's just a trace of hydrocarbons , and most of the nitrogen is locked into nitrates .
TAYLOR: Any sign of dangerous ionization ?
DODGE: No .
TAYLOR: Okay . If there 's no life here , we 've got just seventy-two hours to find it . That 's when the groceries run out .
DODGE: Which direction ?
TAYLOR: That way .
DODGE: Any particular reason ?
TAYLOR: None at all .
DODGE: Eight ounces . Dodge lies back and looks up at the sky .
LANDON: If only we could get a fix .
TAYLOR: What would you learn ? I 've told you where you are and when you are .
DODGE: Taylor quit riding him .
TAYLOR: You 're more than three hundred light years from your precious planet . You loved ones have been dead and forgotten for twenty centuries . Even if you could get back , they 'd think you were something that fell out of a tree .
LANDON: All right
TAYLOR: There 's only one reality left . We 're here and it 's now . You get ahold of that and hang on tight , or you might as well e dead .
LANDON: I 'm prepared to die . Taylor turns to Dodge , throws up his hands .
TAYLOR: He 's prepared to die ! Does n't that make you misty ? Chalk up another victory fo the human spirit !
LANDON: Climb off me , will you !
TAYLOR: And the glory , do n't forget that . There 's a life-sized bronze statue of you somewhere . It 's probably turned green by now , and nobody can read the name plate . But never let it be said we forget our heroes .
LANDON: Taylor . I 'm telling you
TAYLOR: Oh , and one last item . Immortality . You wanted to go on forever . Well , you damn near made it . Except fo Dodge and me , you 've lived longer than anybody . And with Stewart dead , it looks like we 're the last of the strain . You got what you wanted , kid . How does it taste ?
LANDON: Okay . You read me well enough . Why ca n't I read you ?
TAYLOR: Do n't bothe
LANDON: Dodge he 's not like me at all . But he makes sense . Held walk naked into a live volcano if he thought he could learn something no other man knew . I understand why he 's here . But youYou 're no seeker . You 're negative .
TAYLOR: But I 'm not prepared to die .
LANDON: I 'd like to know why not . You thought life on Earth was meaningless . You despised people . So what did you do ? You ran away .
TAYLOR: No , not quite , Landon . I 'm a bit of a seeker myself . But my dreams are a lot emptier than yours . I ca n't get rid of the idea that somewhere in the Universe there must be a creature superior to man .
DODGE: Taylor ! Over here !
TAYLOR: Let 's find them all .
DODGE: It 's a stream bed. , no doubt about it but bone dry .
LANDON: Look . . .
TAYLOR: Let 's take a look .
DODGE: It 's loaded with minerals , but safe .
LANDON: Can we take a dip ?
TAYLOR: Okay .
LANDON'S VOICE: Hey , Taylor ! Look at this
LANDON: My God..they look almost human .
DODGE: They there 's a herd of them .
TAYLOR: Show them we 're friendly .
LANDON: Try telling them our names . Taylor grimaces at Landon .
TAYLOR: Well , if we 're looking for an icebreaker Listen , folks ..
DODGE: I 'm afraid they are n't having any .
LANDON: Shall we follow them ?
TAYLOR: Have n't much choice . As they walk off down the jungle path .
DODGE: Blessed are the vegetarians .
LANDON: We got off at the wrong stop .
TAYLOR: You 're our optimist Look at the bright side . If that 's the best there is around here , in six months we 'll be unning this planet .
DODGE: Look
LANDON: Think they 'll attack us ? Taylor turns , looks back at
APE PHOTOGRAPHER: Smile . The hunter bares his teeth .
ZIRA: Which one was wearing the strange clothes ?
GALEN: Him . Zira looks down at Taylor .
ZIRA: Will he live ?
GALEN: I do n't know . This beast lost a lot of blood .
NURSE: Yes , sir .
ZIRA: This place is dirty , doctor .
GALEN: These animals are dirty , doctor . They stink , and they carry communicable diseases . Why are n't they cleaned up efore they 're brought here ?
ZIRA'S VOICE: You do n't sound happy in your work .
GALEN'S VOICE: I 'm nothing more than a vet in this laboratory
ZIRA'S VOICE: I did . But you know how he looks down his nose at chimpanzees .
GALEN: But the quota system 's been abolished ! You made it . Why ca n't I ?
ZIRA: What do you mean , made it ? I 'm an animal psychologist , that 's all . We do n't have any authority .
GALEN: You do pretty well when it comes to getting space and equipment .
ZIRA: That 's because Dr. Zaius realizes ou work has value .
GALEN: Hmph .
ZIRA: The foundations of scientific brain surgery are being laid right here - in studies of cerebral function in these animals .
GALEN: They 're still dirty . And their bite is septic . Look at that
TAYLOR: Hey ! Hey !
JULIUS: Simmer down ! You especially .
ZIRA: Good morning , Julius . How 's our patient today ?
JULIUS: No change . The minute you open the door , he goes into his act .
ZIRA: Well , what do we want this morning ? Do we want something ? Speak ! Come on , speak !
JULIUS: You could get hurt doing that , Doctor .
ZIRA: Do n't be silly . He 's perfectly tame .
JULIUS: They 're all tame until they take a chunk out of you .
ZIRA: Well , Bright Eyes , is our throat feeling better ?
TAYLOR: Listen , listen I can speak He winces , puts his hand to the bandage .
ZIRA: Awww , it still hurts , does n't it ?
JULIUS: See ? He keeps pretending he can talk . Taylor glares at Julius , slams the bars .
TAYLOR: I 'm not pretending ! I can talk !
ZIRA: Did you see that ? It 's remarkable !
JULIUS: Huh ?
ZIRA: He 's trying to form words .
JULIUS: Well , you know what they say . Human see , human do .
ZIRA: He seems to want something . She advances tentatively toward the cage .
JULIUS: I 'd be careful , doctor .
TAYLOR: What 's the matter with you ? I can talk ! Ca n't you see that ?
JULIUS' VOICE: Good morning , Your Excellency . Taylor looks o.s .
ZIRA: Dr. Zaius , I 'm so glad you could come . He 's over here .
TAYLOR: My - name - is n't - Bright Eyes It 's Taylor !
ZIRA: There ! Can you believe it ? I looks like he 's talking .
ZAIUS: Yes , amusing . A man who acts like an ape . Taylor turns to Zaius .
TAYLOR: I 'm not acting ! I can talk ! How much proof do you want ?
ZIRA: Dr. Zaius , I could have sworn he was answering you !
ZAIUS: He shows a definite gift for mimicry . Zira wiggles her fingers excitedly .
ZIRA: I wonder how held score on a Hopkins manual dexterity test ?
ZAIUS: An animal ?
JULIUS: Look ! Taylor is frantically wiggling his fingers .
ZIRA: He 's moving his fingers !
ZAIUS: Of course . He saw you moving yours .
ZIRA: But perhaps he understood
ZAIUS' VOICE: Man has no understanding , Dr. Zira . He can be taught a few simple tricks . Nothing more .
ZIRA'S VOICE: I beg to disagree . According to my exper- iments
ZAIUS: A word to the wise , Dr. Zira . Experimental ain surgery on these creatures is one thing . I 'm all for it .
APE GUARD: Is this the one you wanted , Doctor ?
ZIRA'S VOICE: Yes , thank you . Bright Eyes ? Taylor looks up .
ZIRA: Put her in with him .
CORNELIUS: Do you have to work tonight ?
ZIRA: No .
CORNELIUS: Neither do I . He gives her a quick peck on the cheek .
ZIRA: That 's Bright Eyes . The one I was telling you about .
CORNELIUS: What 's so special about him ?
ZIRA: Watch . Hello , Bright Eyes . How 's ou throat today ?
CORNELIUS: Remembers what ?
ZIRA: The blood transfusion .
CORNELIUS: Zira , come on . You know they ca n't Oh oh . Here comes Number One . Taylor looks up and o.s. , quickly rises .
ZIRA: Something 's bothering him . He 's een prying around the lab for the last two days
ZAIUS: Oh , yes the young ape with a shovel . I hear you 're planning another archeological expedition .
CORNELIUS' VOICE: Yes , sir . If the academy agrees .
ZAIUS' VOICE: The project will require my support , of course .
CORNELIUS' VOICE: I hope I can count on it , sir .
ZAIUS' VOICE: A friendly warning , Cornelius when you 're digging for artifacts , do n't bury your reputation .
A VOICE: Guards !
ZIRA: Stop ! You 've hurt him ! Take them inside !
ZAIUS: Cornelius , if you have a moment today , I 'd like to discuss this expedition of yours in more detail .
CORNELIUS: Certainly , sir . I 'll get my notes and come ight over .
ZAIUS: That man can be domesticated .
JULIUS: What happened ?
ZIRA: Those fools and their torches ! Do you have any ointment ?
JULIUS: I 'll see .
ZIRA: I 'm sorry , Bright Eyes .
JULIUS: I told you what you 'd get !
ZIRA: Julius , do n't . It does n't matter .
JULIUS: Natural born thieves , are n't they ?
ZIRA: Get me a collar and leash . I 'm taking him to the infirmary .
JULIUS: He 's vicious , Doctor . Besides , it 's against the rules .
ZIRA: Do as I say .
CORNELIUS: It 's a stunt . Humans do n't write .
ZIRA: Dear , you 're a scientist . Do n't you believe your own eyes ?
CORNELIUS: Where did you learn to do this ?
ZIRA: 'And you 're a fool ' . She smiles . Cornelius bristles .
CORNELIUS: Now , just a minute
ZIRA: Oh , Cornelius , be quiet .
CORNELIUS: And they fell out of the sky with you ?
ZIRA: 'Not fell flew ! '
CORNELIUS: Flight is a scientific impossibility .
ZIRA: And even if it were n't , why fly ? Where would it get you ?
CORNELIUS: Well , now
ZIRA: 'Do you have maps ? '
CORNELIUS: We are here You were captured about here .
ZIRA: You fell in the water here ? you came ashore you marched across the desert the mountains many days and nights and reached the jungle . Taylor nods , smiles gratefully .
CORNELIUS: Out - of - the - question ! .
ZIRA: Cornelius , why do you insist on provoking him ?
CORNELIUS: No creature can survive in that part of the Forbidden Zone . I 've been there . I 've seen it .
ZIRA: 'Then how do you account for me ? ,
CORNELIUS: I do n't . And I 'm not going to try .
ZIRA: But what about your theory ? The existence of someone like Taylor might prove it .
CORNELIUS: Zira , are you trying to get my head cut off ?
ZIRA: Do n't be foolish . If it 's true , they 'll have to accept it .
CORNELIUS: No , they wo n't -
ZIRA: Cornelius has developed a brilliant hypothesis -
CORNELIUS: It 's probably wrong
ZIRA: that the ape evolved from a lower orde of primate , possibly man . In his trip to the Forbidden Zone he discovered traces of a culture older than recorded time -
CORNELIUS: The evidence was very meager
ZIRA: You did n't think so then .
CORNELIUS: That was before Dr. Zaius and half the Academy said the idea was heresy .
ZIRA: How can scientific truth be heresy ? What if Taylor is exactly the proof you needed ? A mutation . A missing link between the unevolved primate and the ape -
CORNELIUS: He 's touchy , is n't he ?
ZIRA: ' I am not a missing link . '
CORNELIUS: Because if he is a missing link , it means the Sacred Scrolls are n't worth thei parchment .
ZIRA: Well , maybe they 're not .
CORNELIUS: No , thank you ' . I wo n't get into that battle .
ZIRA: Oh , Cornelius , show some strength !
CORNELIUS: Zira , listen to me . We 've got a fine future ahead of us . Marriage . Stimulating careers . I 'm up for a raise
ZAIUS: Did you forget our appointment , Cornelius ?
CORNELIUS: Oh. , no. , sir . I was just assembling my notes .
ZAIUS: You know Dr. Maximus , our Commissione for Animal Affairs ?
CORNELIUS: Certainly , sir . It 's a pleasure to see you again .
MAXIMUS: What is that ?
ZIRA: A man , Dr. Maximus .
MAXIMUS: I know it 's a man . And you know the ules . No animals outside the compound , and most certainly not without a leash .
ZIRA: Yes , Sir . But this creature is a special case .
MAXIMUS: Why special ?
ZIRA: We 're conducting a new experiment .
ZAIUS: Would n't it more properly be done in your office ?
ZIRA: Yes , Sir .
MAXIMUS: Guards ? The gorilla GUARDS enter from outside .
ZAIUS' VOICE: What 's this ?
ZIRA: A toy . It floats on the air . Try it .
CORNELIUS: Zira .
ZAIUS: Nonsense .
JULIUS' VOICE: What 's up , Lieutenant ?
APE LIEUTENANT: We 're taking Number Four over to surgery in five minutes . Have him ready .
JULIUS: How come ? The beast 's throat is nearly healed .
LIEUTENANT: It 's not his throat this time . The vet 's going to geld him .
JULIUS' VOICE: Dr. Zira wo n't like it . She wants this pair to mate .
LIEUTENANT: These orders came from Dr. Zaius himself . There 's nothing she can do about it .
JULIUS: If only you knew , Bright Eyes , what they 're going to do Stand still nowdo n't give me any trouble .
MINISTER: Weep if you must , but make an end of sorrow . He lives again . Yes , he has found peace in Heaven .
MINISTER'S VOICE: He was a model for us all , a gorilla to emember ; hunter , warrior , defender of the Faith .
MINISTER: Cherished husband , beloved father , generous master yes , he was a font of simian kindness .
MINISTER'S VOICE: The dear departed once said to me ' I never met an ape I did n't like ' The small fry spots Taylor .
CHILD: Look ! . It 's a man !
MINISTER: In Heaven 's name Get rid of that creature . Two ushers rise , moving past CAMERA and o.s .
FIRST USHER: There he is They move toward Taylor .
FIRST CHIMP: You see what I saw ?
SECOND CHIMP: Must 've escaped from the zoo .
TAYLOR: Dodge Taylor vanishes in a BLUR of movement .
ZIRA: Taylor , why 'd you run away ?
LIEUTENANT: Security police .
ZIRA: I 'm in charge of this man .
LIEUTENANT: No longer , madame . He is now in the custody of the Ministry of Science .
TAYLOR: Get away from me , you dirty ape !
TAYLOR: and that 's when I decided to take up astronautical engineering. , you see . I was halfway through college and I It 's an old trick ! The silent treatment . Four weeks and three days , and not a word from anyone . Not Zira. , or Corneliuso that damn Julius . No one 'll listen only you . YouNova . NO-VAH .
JULIUS: Turn it off ! The ape guard shuts off the hose .
TAYLOR: Answer me ! Julius strides over to Taylor 's cage .
JULIUS: Shut up ! The reason no one 'll talk to you is because you 're a freak !
TAYLOR: Where 's Dr. Zira ? Why ?
JULIUS: I said shut up !
TAYLOR: Ape ! Apes wearing clothes ! It 's a madhouse ! A madhouse ! He sinks to the floor as the apes go out .
TAYLOR: Now I do n't even have you . Imagine me needing someone . Back on Earth there was nobody . Women , yes . Lots of them . Love making ithout love . That 's the kind of world it was turning into , with the help of cynics like myself . So I left it because there was no one dear enough to keep me there . Did I tell you about Stewart ? There was a lovely girl . The most precious cargo we brought along . If human life could survive here , she was to be the new Eve . It 's probably just as well she did n't live to see this .
ZIRA: Shhhh !
TAYLOR: What is this ?
ZIRA: A hearing .
CORNELIUS: Be clever . Be quiet ,
BAILIFF: All rise !
PRESIDENT: This ad hoc Tribunal of the National Academy is now in session . President of the Academy presiding . On my right , Dr. Maximus , Commissioner for Animal Affairs . On my left , Dr. Zaius , Minister of Science and Chief Defender of the Faith Appearing for the State , Dr. Honorius , Deputy Minister of Justice . Honorius rises and bows .
ZIRA: By your leave , Mr. President the Tribunal has not yet defined the purpose of this inquiry .
MAXIMUS: You asked for the opportunity to present your case . Surely you must know why you 're here .
ZIRA: My own purpose is to save this exceptional creature from mutilation .
MAXIMUS: And our purpose is to settle custodial and jurisdictional questions concerning this east , and determine what 's to be done with him .
ZIRA: At the very least , this man has the right to know whether there 's a charge against him .
HONORIUS: Objection . The accused is indeed a man . Therefore , he has no rights under ape law .
PRESIDENT: Well , Dr. Zira ? This is a man , is he not ?
ZIRA: He is unlike any man you have ever seen - as we hope to prove .
PRESIDENT'S VOICE: Answer the question . Is he a man ?
CORNELIUS: Sir ? The question is the point at issue Is he a man ? Or a deviate ? Or a freak of nature ?
HONORIUS' VOICE: Objection !
PRESIDENT: Sustained . In all fairness , Dr. Zira , you must admit the accused is a nonape , and therefore has no rights under ape law .
ZIRA: Then why is he called the accused You Honors must think him guilty of something . Honorius seems confounded . Zaius takes over .
ZAIUS: This man is not being tried . He is being disposed of . It is scientific heresy that is actually on trial here .
MAXIMUS: Well put , Dr. Zaius . Let us warn our friends that they endanger thei own careers by defending this animal .
TAYLOR: Then I 'll defend myself .
PRESIDENT: Dr. Zira tell Bright Eyes to sit down .
TAYLOR: My name is Taylor .
PRESIDENT: It says here that his name is Bright Eyes . You gave him that name yourself .
TAYLOR: This hearing is absurd ! Let me tell my story
PRESIDENT: Bailiff ! Make the animal be quiet .
HONORIUS: Learned Judges My case is simple . It is ased on our first Article of Faith that the Almighty created the ape in his own image ; that He gave him a soul and a mind ; that He set him apart from the beasts of the jungle , and made him the lord of the planet .
HONORIUS' VOICE: These sacred truths are self-evident . The proper study of apes is apes . But certain young cynics have chosen to study man - yes , perverted scientists who advance on insidious theory called 'evolution . '
HONORIUS: There is a conspiracy afoot to undermine the very cornerstone of our Faith
PRESIDENT: Come to the point , Dr. Honorius .
HONORIUS: Directly , Mr. President . This wretched man ,
ZIRA: ThatÕs a lie !
PRESIDENT: Mind your tongue , madame .
ZIRA: Did we create his mind too ? Not only can this man speak . He can write . He can eason .
PRESIDENT: Proceed . But do n't turn this hearing into a farce .
HONORIUS: Tell the court , Bright Eyes what is the second Article of Faith ?
TAYLOR: I admit , I know nothing of your culture .
HONORIUS: Of course he does n't know our culture - ecause he can not think . Tell us why all apes are created equal .
TAYLOR: Some apes , it seems , are more equal than others .
HONORIUS: Ridiculous . That answer is a contradiction in terms . Tell us , Bright Eyes , why do men have no souls ? What is the proof that a divine spark exists in the simian brain ?
TAYLOR: Show this to the President .
ZIRA: Since the defendant is forbidden to speak in his own defense , he asks that this statement be read into the record .
PRESIDENT: Read it yourself .
ZIRA: ' I have come to you from a planet in a different solar system . I am an explore in space , with no hostile intentions against your civilization . On my planet it was the primate Man who evolved Into a thinking animal , while the apes remained ''
PRESIDENT: Stop right there . Bring me that paper .
ZIRA: Is it a joke to seek the truth about this man ?
ZAIUS: Dr. Zira you state here that a ship from outer space sank in an inland sea of our eastern desert .
ZIRA: I do not state it , sir . The prisoner does .
ZAIUS: Do you believe him ?
ZIRA: Like you , I find it difficult .
ZAIUS: But how convenient that the proof of his arrival has vanished ? You also state that Bright Eyes had two intelligent companions at the time of his capture .
ZIRA: This is his assertion .
ZAIUS: Where are they now ?
TAYLOR: One is in a museum !
PRESIDENT: Dr. Zira ! Silence that man !
ZAIUS: How sad . Stuffed and mounted , eh ? Dead men , like sunken ships , can tell no stories . And his other companion ?
ZIRA: He does n't know .
ZAIUS: Mr. President , I believe the Prosecuto has reassembled all he surviving humans captured in the hunt along with Bright Eyes .
HONORIUS: That 's true , Dr. Zaius . My witnesses correction my exhibits are on display in the amphitheater .
PRESIDENT: Very well . I suggest we go and look at them .
TAYLOR: It 's himLandon .
ZIRA: Which one ?
TAYLOR: Second from the left .
ZAIUS: Welldo you acknowledge kinship with any of these creatures ?
TAYLOR: With one of them .
ZAIUS: Identify him , then . Speak to him . Taylor moves forward for a few paces , stops .
TAYLOR: Landon ?
ZIRA: No , I swear I never saw this man before .
TAYLOR: You did this to him ! You 've removed his frontal lobes !
PRESIDENT: Silence ! Bailiff , take the prisoner inside !
ZAIUS: Mr. President , a word of explanation the creature in question suffered a skull fracture during the hunt . Two fine veternary surgeons under my direction were able to save his life . But the beast could not speak , of course . Nor will he ever speak
TAYLOR: You destroyed his memory ! His mind ! His identity ! And , you want to do the same to me !
PRESIDENT: Bailiff ! Stop this outburst ! Gag that monstrosity !
TAYLOR: You barbarians !
CORNELIUS: May it please the Tribunal I for one grant that this being can not have come from another planet . But this much is certain he comes from somewhere in the Forbidden Zone . He has described the region to us , and described it accurately , for I have been there .
PRESIDENT: You visited the Forbidden Zone ?
CORNELIUS: Why , yes , sir . A year ago . With the special permission of the Academy .
ZAIUS: He exceeded his orders . His travel permit was promptly revoked .
CORNELIUS: Yes , sir , so it was thanks to you . But not before I discovered evidence of a simian culture that existed long before the Sacred Scrolls were written
PRESIDENT: Sustained . Your archeological theories have no bearing on the disposition of this creature .
ZAIUS: Let them talk , Mr President . Let them talk .
ZIRA: Sirs our theories have a bearing on his identity .
PRESIDENT: How so ?
ZIRA: Let us assume , as common sense dictates , that the prisoner 's story is false . But if he does not come from another planet , then surely he sprang from our own . Yes , sprang . As an animal psychologist , I have found no physiological defect to explain why humans are mute .
HONORIUS: Objection !
PRESIDENT: Sustained .
ZIRA: Their speech organs are adequate . The flaw lies not in anatomy but in the brain .
HONORIUS: Objection !
PRESIDENT: Sustained .
ZIRA: Sustain all objections , but face the truth !
CORNELIUS: Yes ! Behold this marvel , this living paradox , this missing link in an evolutionary chain !
PRESIDENT: Silence ! You have gone too far .
ZAIUS: There you are , Mr. President . I warned you these two would use this hearing as a forum for subversion .
MAXIMUS: You were right ! The advocates of heresy have evealed themselves .
ZAIUS: Mr. President , I think an indictment is in order .
HONORIUS: Yes , sir . The State charges Doctors Zira and Cornelius with contempt of this Tribunal , malicious mischief and scientific heresy .
PRESIDENT: Be it so ordered . The Tribunal will examine all the evidence presented here and in due time render a verdict on the proposed indictment and on the disposition of the deviate in question . This hearing is adjourned .
ZAIUS: Wait outside .
TAYLOR: What about me ?
ZAIUS: Oh , your case was preordained . In a way , you performed a service for the State Because your hearing made it possible for us to expose Zira and Cornelius . And now the Tribunal has placed you in my custody forfinal disposition . Do you know what that means ?
TAYLOR: No .
ZAIUS: Emasculation , to begin with . Then experimental surgery . On the speech centers . On the brain . Ultimately , a kind of living death .
TAYLOR: I told the truth at that 'hearing'of yours .
ZAIUS: You lied . Where is your tribe ?
TAYLOR: My tribe , as you call it , lives on anothe planet in a distant solar system .
ZAIUS: Then how is it we speak the same language ? Even in your lies , some truth slips through ! That mythical community you 're supposed to come from Fort Wayne ' ?
TAYLOR: What about it ?
ZAIUS: A fort ! Unconsciously , you chose a name that was belligerent . Where were you nurtured ?
TAYLOR: I take it you do n't believe the prosecutor 's charge that I 'm a monster created by Dr. Zira .
ZAIUS: Certainly not . You 're a mutant .
TAYLOR: That 's exactly what Zira and Cornelius claim . You 're talking heresy , doctor .
ZAIUS: Of course .
TAYLOR: All right , suppose I am a mutant ? Why does the appearance of one mutant send you into a panic ?
ZAIUS: Because you 're not unique . There was the one you call Landon
TAYLOR: Then you admit
ZAIUS: I admit that where there 's one mutant there 's
TAYLOR: Thank you for calling me Taylor . Dr. Zaius , I know who I am . Who are you ? How did this upside down civilization ever get started ?
ZAIUS: You may well call it upside down , since you occupy its lowest level . And deservedly . The eastern desert has never been explored ecause we 've always assumed that no life can exist there . Save yourself , Taylor . Tell me is there another jungle beyond the Forbidden Zone ?
TAYLOR: I do n't know .
ZAIUS: If you are protecting others of your kind , it will cost you your identity .
TAYLOR: I 'm not protecting anybody ! That hearing was a farce . What have I done ?
ZAIUS: You 're a menace ! A walking pestilence . I do know who you are , Taylor . As I know that others of your kind must live in the Forbidden Zone . You have just six hours to make a full confession . After that I 'll employ surgery to obtain one . Guards !
TAYLOR: All right , you can cut me to pieces . It 's within your power . But know this , doctor . You do it because you 're afraid of me . You do it from fear !
LUCIUS: Are you Julius ?
JULIUS: What do you want ?
LUCIUS: I 'm from the Office of Animal Affairs . This male 's to be transferred to the zoo .
JULIUS: At this hour ? Who says so ?
LUCIUS: Do n't they tell you anything ? The Anti- vivisectionist Society is up in arms . They 're going to save this beast from those butchers in the lab . If he can speak he belongs in the public zoo . But what 'll probably happen is that some money-mad grown-up will put him in a circus . And then we 'll have to pay to see what ightfully should have
JULIUS: Stop making speeches and show me the order .
LUCIUS: Hit him !
TAYLOR: Who are you ?
LUCIUS: So you can talk . I 'm Dr. Zira 's nephew . This abduction was her idea . You 're not really going to the zoo . That 's just our cover story in case we 're stopped . Although I do feel that if it ever came down to a question of whether something like you should be public or private property
TAYLOR: Come on . Get me out of here .
LUCIUS' VOICE: We 've got to move fast .
TAYLOR: She comes along too .
LUCIUS: Zira does n't want your female .
TAYLOR: I want her .
LUCIUS: If you insist . But I 'm not taking any orders
TAYLOR: Fine . Just let her out .
ZIRA: I told you not to bring the other one .
LUCIUS: He would n't leave her .
ZIRA: All right Get inhurry . Put this on .
TAYLOR: Listen-
ZIRA: Taylor just keep quiet and we may get away with this . Remember that men all look alike to most apes .
LUCIUS: Gorilla hunters
ZIRA: Keep moving . We ca n't turn back now .
LEADER: Hold it !
ZIRA: You ca n't ! I 've two sick humans in the cage . We 're taking them to the chief vet at the zoo
LEADER: We bagged two live ones today . I 'll have to ask you to take them along . He moves to the rear of the wagon .
ZIRA: No , no , my animals are diseased Leave them alone ! They 're diseased , I tell you !
FIRST HUNTER: Give him a taste of fire !
LUCIUS: Stand back ! He 's dangerous !
FIRST HUNTER: Why ?
ZIRA: He 's rabid ! His bite is fatal !
FIRST HUNTER: You serious ?
LUCIUS: You would die in agony ! Frothing at the mouth !
FIRST HUNTER: They treat those animals better than they treat us .
LEADER: I still say the only good human is a dead human .
CORNELIUS: How did it go ?
ZIRA: There was one bad moment some hunters stopped us .
LUCIUS: I pursuaded them our beasts had rabies .
TAYLOR: Let me out of here !
CORNELIUS: Well , Taylor we 're all fugitives now .
TAYLOR: Do you have any weapons ?
CORNELIUS: The best . But we wo n't need them .
TAYLOR: Just the same , I want one .
CORNELIUS: Look here , Taylor . I 'm in charge of this expedition
TAYLOR: Fair enough . But you 're no longer in charge of me . And I do n't mean to be captured again . Zira and Lucius have come up .
CORNELIUS: As you wish .
TAYLOR: Zaius seems to think there might be another jungle beyond the Forbidden Zone . That 's what we 'll try for . What about you ?
ZIRA: Cornelius and I have been indicted fo heresy . Unless we can prove our theories , we do n't stand a chance of acquittal .
TAYLOR: You 're going back to the Forbidden Zone ?
CORNELIUS: To the diggings I worked at a year ago . It 's a three day ride across the eastern desert , near where you claim you landed from that planet of yours .
TAYLOR: You still do n't believe me , do you ?
CORNELIUS: It 's a long detour to Dead Lake . What would we find ?
TAYLOR: Nothing much . The remnants of a life raft . Maybe a small flag . The emblem of my countrymen .
CORNELIUS: Sorry , Taylor . The terrain around that lake is poisonous . There is no fresh water , no vegetation . Nothing .
TAYLOR: I know Nevertheless , I thank you for saving us . You 'll be in trouble fo going there .
ZIRA: We 've been in trouble since the moment we met you .
ZIRA'S VOICE: What 's she pointing at ?
TAYLOR: That 's the way home . And she knows it .
ZIRA: We 'd better get started . If the mounted police pick up our trail , they 'll come this far at least .
CORNELIUS: Right . Let 's put the water and provisions in the wagon . He and Lucius move off toward the horses .
ZIRA: Are you going to take her with you ?
TAYLOR: Yes .
ZIRA: Actually , you 're a different breed . This creature will never evolve .
TAYLOR: Maybe not .
ZIRA: You want her that much ?
TAYLOR: You threw us together , remember ? And you guessed right . Men , like apes , get despondent without a mate .
LUCIUS: Who put them up ?
ZIRA: The Hunt Club .
LUCIUS: To scare off humans ?
CORNELIUS: To scare us , too . We 're entering the Forbidden Zone .
TAYLOR: Do n't worry . You 'll be safe with me . Here . It 's time you learned to earn your keep .
LUCIUS: Something 's wrong with your mate .
ZIRA: Let me handle this . You may be smarter than I am , but I 'm the veterinary on this planet .
TAYLOR: Where does the river lead ?
CORNELIUS: It empties into a sea some miles from here . That 's where the cave is .
TAYLOR'S VOICE: And beyond that ?
CORNELIUS: Do n't know . At high tide you ca n't ride along the shore , and we had no boats on the last expedition .
TAYLOR: You 've never told me why this region 's called the Forbidden Zone .
CORNELIUS: No one really knows . It 's an ancient taboo . Set forth in the Sacred Scrolls . The Lawgiver pronounced the area deadly .
LUCIUS: Should n't we be moving on ?
TAYLOR: I 'm for that . They start toward the horses and wagon .
ZIRA: She 's not sick at all . She 's pregnant .
TAYLOR: So I 'm not an altogethe different breed , you see ?
LUCIUS: Why did you do that ? Scrape off you hair ?
TAYLOR: In my world before I left it - only youngsters of your age wore un- scraped hair .
CORNELIUS: It makes you look somehow less intelligent .
TAYLOR: When are you going to show me what 's in the cave ?
CORNELIUS: Right now , if you like .
ZAIUS: You 're all under arrest ! You seditious scoundrel . Drop that ifle .
TAYLOR: Stop right there .
ZAIUS: Do n't be a fool . You 're outnumbered and outgunned . Taylor aims at Zaius and calls out
TAYLOR: If there 's any shooting , Dr. Zaius , you 'll be the first to die . Depend on it .
CORNELIUS: Taylor , you 're not in command here . Put down that gun .
TAYLOR: Shut up . Silence . Zaius knows Taylor is n't bluffing .
ZAIUS: Very well . Lower your weapons . They obey . Taylor calls again
TAYLOR: Tell them to move around the point . Out of range .
CORNELIUS: How did you know we 'd come here ?
ZAIUS: It was n't difficult . Only an apostate or a lunatic would flee to the Forbidden Zone . I see you brought along the female of your species . I did n't realize a man could be monogamous .
TAYLOR: On this planet it 's easy .
ZAIUS: I ask you to reconsider the rash course you 've taken . If you 're convicted of heresy , the most you 'll get is two years . But if you persist in pointing guns in my direction , you 'll hang for high treason .
CORNELIUS: We 've never meant to be treasonable , sir . But up there , in the face of that Cliff , is a vast cave and in that cave a fabulous treasure of fossils and artifacts .
ZAIUS: I 've seen some of your fossils and artifacts . They 're worthless .
TAYLOR: And that 's your Minister of Science . Honor- ound to expand the frontiers of knowledge .
ZIRA: Taylor , please
TAYLOR: Except that he 's also the Chief Defende of the Faith .
ZAIUS: There is no contradiction between faith and science . True science .
TAYLOR: All right , let 's see if you 're willing to put that statement to a test .
CORNELIUS: Taylor , I 'd rather you -
TAYLOR: No . You saved me from this fanatic . Maybe I can pay you back .
ZAIUS: What is your proposal ?
TAYLOR: When were the Sacred Scrolls written ?
ZAIUS: Twelve hundred years ago .
TAYLOR: Very well . If Zira and Cornelius can prove that those scrolls do n't tell the whole truth of your history ; if they can show you definite evidence of another culture from an unrecorded past will you exonerate them ?
ZAIUS: Of course .
TAYLOR: Okay.Up to the cave .
LUCIUS: Always giving orders . Just like every other adult .
TAYLOR: Relax . You 'll see it all later .
ZAIUS: Present your evidence , Cornelius .
CORNELIUS: It was at this level I discovered traces of an early ape creature stage of primitive barbarism , really dating back oughly thirteen hundred years . It was here I found cutting tools and arrowheads of quartz and the fossilized bones of carnivorous gorillas .
ZAIUS: Do n't speak to me in absolutes . The evidence is contestable .
CORNELIUS: I apologize .
ZAIUS: To begin with , your methods of dating the past are crude , to say the least . There are geologists on my staff who would laugh at your speculations .
TAYLOR: Perhaps that 's why they 're on your staff .
ZAIUS: Secondly , if these 'tools ' as you call them , are unidentified , why are they introduced as 'evidence ' of anything ?
ZIRA: But there 's the doll , sir .
ZAIUS: What ?
CORNELIUS: Right there . The human doll . Zaius deigns to stoop and pick it up .
ZAIUS: What does this prove ? My grand- daughter plays with human dolls .
ZIRA: Taylor ! Tell him .
TAYLOR: He has a point . On my planet children often play with ape dolls .
CORNELIUS: A doll alone proves nothing . True . But the doll was found beside the jawbone of a man and no trace of simian fossils has turned up in this deposit .
ZAIUS: Your conclusion is premature . Have you forgotten your Scripture ? The Thirteenth Scroll ? 'And Proteus brought the upright beast into the garden , and chained him to a tree , and the children made sport of him . '
CORNELIUS: No sir , I have n't forgotten .
ZAIUS: Well ? For a time the ancients kept humans as household pets . Until the Lawgive proved that man could not be tamed . Keep digging Cornelius . You 'll find evidence of the master of this house an ape .
ZIRA: Are you going to let that pass without an answer ?
TAYLOR: Yes . I have to agree . From all you 've found so far , his position 's as good as yours .
CORNELIUS: What are you doing there ?
TAYLOR: Reconstructing a life . Care to have a look ?
ZAIUS: That 's lunacy . I can give an alternate description for everyone of those objects that 's equally as inventive as yours . But it would be conjecture , not proof .
DOLL'S HEAD: Mamma ! Mamma ! Mamma ! .
TAYLOR: Dr. Zaius ! Would an ape make a human doll that talks ?
ZIRA: Lucius .
TAYLOR: You louse !
ZAIUS: Cease fire ! Withdraw !
TAYLOR: I ought to kill you right now . Let 's go . They move off down the trail .
LUCIUS: They took me by surprise . Sneaked up on me while I was watering the horses . What 's happened to honor ? I got off one round to warn you .
CORNELIUS: They 've taken everything .
TAYLOR: Not everything . They left a hostage . How do you feel , Lucius ?
LUCIUS: Disillusioned But vindicated ! I 've been right all along . You ca n't trust the olde generation . It 's a matter of values
TAYLOR: All right , all right . Will You do me a favor ? No orders .
LUCIUS: What is it ?
TAYLOR: I want you to go around the bend and tell those gorillas their leader is my prisoner .
LUCIUS: Yes , I can do that .
TAYL0R: Good . Say I want a week 's supply of food for the woman and myself . A horse . A spade . And fifty rounds of ammunition .
LUCIUS: What if they wo n't agree to your terms ?
TAYLOR: Then tell them Dr. Zaius wo n't leave here alive .
ZIRA: Taylor , you ca n't .
ZAIUS: Oh yes he can . He 's a born killer . Deliver the message .
TAYLOR: Sit down . Over there .
ZIRA: Taylor , please do n't treat him that way .
TAYLOR: Why not ?
ZIRA: It 's humiliating .
TAYLOR: Was n't I humiliated ? By all of you ? Did n't you lead me around on a leash ?
CORNELIUS: That was different . We thought you were . inferior .
TAYLOR: And now you know the truth . Cornelius has beaten you , Doctor . He proved it . Man preceded you here . You owe him your science , your language , whatever knowledge you have .
ZAIUS: Then answer this If ran was superior , why did n't he survive ?
TAYLOR: He might have been wiped out by a plague . Natural catastrophe . Like a fiery storm of meteors . From the looks of this part of your planet , I 'd say that was a fair bet .
ZIRA,: But we ca n't be sure .
TAYLOR: He is . He knew all the time . Long before your discovery , he knew . Defender of the Faith . Guardian of the terrible secret . Is n't that right , doctor ?
ZAIUS: What I know of man was written long ago set down by the wisest ape of all our Lawgiver . Open my breast pocket .
CORNELIUS: 'Beware the beast man , for he is the devil 's pawn . Alone among God 's primates , he kills for sport , or lust or greed . Yes , he will murder his brother to possess his brother 's land . Let him not breed in great numbers , for he will make a desert of his home and yours . Shun him . Drive him ack into his jungle lair For he is the harbinger of death ' .
ZAIUS: I found nothing in the cave to alter that conception of man . And I still live by its injunction .
TAYLOR: Stay where you are !
LUCIUS: They think you 're behaving foolishly . I must say I agree . Where will you go ?
TAYLOR: I 'll start by following the shoreline . And my nose .
ZIRA: But suppose you find nothing but a wasteland . How will you survive ?
ZAIUS: He wo n't survive . Do you know what sort of life awaits you out there , Taylor ? That of an animal . If you are n't eventually hunted down and killed by apes , some jungle beast will devour you .
TAYLOR: Then there is another jungle ?
ZAIUS: Of course , you could return with us . Ou society might find a place for you and your mate .
TAYLOR: Sure . In a cage .
ZAIUS: Where else , but in a cage , does man elong ?
TAYLOR: No , thanks . I 'll take freedom .
ZIRA: We ca n't .
TAYLOR: It 's better than going to prison fo heresy .
CORNELIUS: They ca n't convict us of that . You proved our innocence . Besides his culture is our culture .
TAYLOR: Good luck then .
ZIRA: All right , but . you 're so damned ugly ! Taylor smiles , leans down , kisses her .
TAYLOR: God bless you . He extends his hand to Lucius , who takes it .
LUCIUS: I think you 're making a mistake .
TAYLOR: That 's the boy . Keep 'em flying .
LUCIUS: What ?
TAYLOR: The flags of discontent . It 's the only way anything ever gets changed . Do n't try to follow us . I 'm pretty handy with things like this .
ZAIUS: Of that I 'm sure . All my life I 've awaited your coming and dreaded it . Like death itself .
TAYLOR: Why ? From the first , I 've terrified you , Doctor . And in spite of every sign that I 'm an intelligent being who means no harm , you continue to hate and fear me . Why ?
ZAIUS: Because you are a man . And you were right I have always known about man . From the evidence , I believe his wisdom must walk hand in hand with his idiocy . His emotions must rule his brain . He must be a warlike animal who gives battle to everything around him even himself .
TAYLOR: What evidence ? No weapons were found in the cave .
ZAIUS: The Forbidden Zone was once a paradise . Your breed made a desert of it , ages ago .
TAYLOR: We 're back at the beginning . I still do n't know the why . A planet where apes evolved from men . A world turned wrong side up . A puzzle with one piece missing .
ZAIUS: Do n't look for it , Taylor . You may not like what you find .
MARCUS: Yes , sir . He remounts his horse and rides o.s .
CORNELIUS: Seal the cave ?
ZAIUS: That 's correct . And you will both stand trial for heresy .
ZIRA: But the proof ? The doll ?
ZAIUS: In a few minutes there will be no doll . There ca n't be . I 'm sorry . Cornelius throws himself at Zaius .
CORNELIUS: You must n't ! You gave your 'word ! Zaius looks emptily at one of his apes .
ZAIUS: What I do , I do with no pleasure . Silence him .
LUCIUS: Dr. Zaius , this is inexcusable ! Why must knowledge stand still ? What about the future ? Zaius looks benevolently at Julius .
ZAIUS: I may just have saved it for you .
LUCIUS: What will he find out there , doctor ?
ZAIUS: His destiny .
TAYLOR: Yes , Nova I see it . In my old profession green meant safe . Green meant go .

MR. JOHNSON: Like the other night , when I closed up by myself . That was different
DAVID: Forget about that !
MR. JOHNSON: Oh Okay . But I really liked it .
DAVID: Look , you ca n't always like what you do . Sometimes you just do it because it 's your job . And even if you do n't like it , you just got ta do it anyway .

UTAH: Wait , so I 'm a big hero to my folks , ight ? But two years ago they got killed in a car wreck and I just suddenly ealized all my goals had been thei goals . And I had n't been living my own life . So I wanted something fo myself . Something that maybe did n't make any sense . You know what I mean ?
TYLER: Tomorrow , 6 AM . Here . If you 're a minute late I 'm gone . And Stud I did n't take you to aise . I can show you a few things ut after that you 're on your own . That 'll be four fifty .
UTAH: Keep the change , Teach .
TYLER: Stop here . Do you agree to do exactly what I say when I say it ?
UTAH: Sure .
TYLER: Do it again .
UTAH: Who 's that ?
TYLER: The modern savage . Guy 's even crazier than you , Johnny Utah . C'mon .
BODHI: Hey Tyler !
ROACH: The fuck you doin ' man ? ! You fuckin ' crazy ? Bodhi flashes a million dollar smile .
BODHI: Chill , brah . You know who this is ? Johnny Utah . Ohio State , all- conference . Rose Bowl three years ago . Right ? Johnny nods . Tyler looks at him no shit ?
ROACH: Johnny fuckin ' Utah ! Fuckin'-A ! Yeah , I remember that game , man . You were on-fire . They could not stop your ass .
GROMMET: Radical ! Head-butt , dude ! ! Johnny gestures `` Please no '' .
BODHI: Something happened . You got nuked in the last quarter .
UTAH: Yeah , my knee got folded about 90 degrees the wrong way .
BODHI: And that 's why you never went pro ?
UTAH: Two years of surgery . I missed my window . Limped through law school instead .
BODHI: Mmm . A lawyer , huh ? Too bad . But at least you 're surfing now . So your life 's not over yet , right ?
UTAH: Not yet .
COLE: Like totally rad stick , dude .
SEVERAL AGENTS: Gnarly , man hang ten cowabunga surf patrol rip it up !
HARP: How was the beach ?
UTAH: Fine .
HARP: Surf conditions okay ?
UTAH: A little mushy .
HARP: A little mushy ! You think the taxpayers would like it , Utah , if they knew they were paying a federal agent to surf and pick up girls ?
UTAH: Babes .
HARP: What ?
UTAH: The correct term is babes , sir . Uh , this type of undercover operation is entirely dependent on picking up the idiom of the speech . Otherwise penetration is not possible , sir . Of the social infrastructure , I mean . Harp inhales through his nose . A bad sign .
HARP: Where is Pappas ? Utah points across the room . Harp turns .
UTAH: Caught my first tube this morning .
PAPPAS: What , you could n't have just left the thing in your car ?
UTAH: It sticks out , so I ca n't lock it . Look , Angelo , you think I joined the FBI to learn to surf ? This was you lame-o idea in the first place . You got ta back me up on this .
PAPPAS: Johnny , all I can say is we bette come up with something real soon .
MISS DEER: One four centimeter strand . Colo own . Oily . Slight wave .
PAPPAS: Hell , what 're we waiting for , let 's go pick the guy up .
UTAH: Angelo , pay attention . There 's gon na be a test afterward . Lab is showing traces of toxins . PCBs . Heavy elements selenium , titanium and arsenic .
PAPPAS: Guy 's the Toxic Avenger .
UTAH: The beaches are always being closed ecause of waste spills , right ? And surfers are territorial . They stick mostly to certain breaks . If we can get some hair samples , and get a match to a certain beach , we 'd know which break the Ex-Presidents surf . You buyin ' this ?
PAPPAS: No . But let 's do it , anyway . It 's gon na bug the shit out of Harp .
UTAH: Whoa , brah , easy now Do n't move ! Got some huge sucker crawling into your Got it ! Uuuughhh .
HALSEY: Naw , this is n't it .
PAPPAS: He moved .
HALSEY: PCBs , selenium , titanium , arsenic . The percentages look right . Here 's a match .
UTAH: Latigo Beach .
PAPPAS: Surf 's up , ace .
UTAH: Big zippo so far . How about you ?
WARCHILD: This the guy ?
BUNKER: Yeah .
UTAH: Okay , so this is where you tell me all about how locals rule and yuppie insects like me should n't be surfing your break and all that , right ?
BUNKER: No .
TONE: Waste of time .
WARCHILD: We 're just going to fuck you up .
UTAH: Oh .
PAPPAS: Johnny ? You there ?
ARCHBOLD: The dude can fight !
BODHI: Back off ! Now ! ! Just let it go !
BUNKER: Stay outta this , Bodhi !
BODHI: He 's with me . Now back off . Seriously.Just do it ! You alright Warchild ?
WARCHILD: Fuck you . Everybody has backed off a bit , panting .
UTAH: What 's your name ?
BUNKER: Bunker .
UTAH: Well , listen , Bunker I 'm actually kinda glad you found me .
BUNKER: Yeah ? Why ?
BODHI: Whoa ! Whoa ! Hold it , ladies . Give it a rest . Let 's go . He literally turns Utah around .
PAPPAS: Uh , you guys seen a kid , maybe 10 , 12 , running with a car stereo ? Stole the fucking CD too , you elieve it ? Utah is grateful for the cover .
UTAH: No , but there are four guys back there you might check out .
PAPPAS: Thanks , buddy . He shoves on .
UTAH: Friends of yours , huh ?
BODHI: The one you decked is Bunker Wiess . The big one is his brother , Warchild . The other two always hang . They think they 're some kinda death squad around here .
UTAH: What 's their program ?
BODHI: They 're punks . Nazis . Their brains are wired wrong . They hurt surfing ecause they give nothing back , and they have no respect for the sea . They just want to get radical . It 's mindless aggression . They 'll neve get it , the spiritual side of it .
UTAH: You always talk like this ? You 're not gon na start chanting or anything are you ?
BODHI: No . So I was up the beach . I saw it going down . you did n't hesitate they never backed you up an inch . That 's rare in this world .
UTAH: Thanks for stepping in .
BODHI: De nada .
UTAH: Gon na be some people at my house tonight . Maybe you can make it .
BODHI: Come with Tyler . She knows .
PAPPAS: Ten seconds you 're out of sight . Unbelievable .
UTAH: You 're losin ' them . That 's right . Two-denver-four-sam- niner-five-niner . Late seventies Jeep .
PAPPAS: Look , if you 're gon na go leavin ' your piece and your shield in the car , you can damn well stay in sight . Okay ?
UTAH: Okay , Dad .
PAPPAS: Remember , all bank robbers are losers , but not all losers are bank obbers .
UTAH: These are the guys . I can feel it . I say we lay it on Harp .
MUNOZ: This is bullshit . This is a ullshit lead . This is totally ullshit . Harp must be fucking desperate if he 's listening to you two flakes .
UTAH: See you bright and early , guys .
PAPPAS: Cold pizza ? It 's great fo eakfast .
UTAH: When did Harp say they 'd have the warrant ?
PAPPAS: He 's pushing it through first thing . You better get some sleep tonight , it could be an interesting morning .
UTAH: Nice place .
TYLER: He rents it for the summer . Bodhi always gets some slick place and throws it open to every surf burnout around . Most a these guys ca n't keep a job . When the swell comes , they 're gone , they have to ride .
GROMMET: Do your worst , man !
UTAH: Do n't you gamble ?
BODHI: Only make bets I ca n't afford to lose . Only way to be 100 % committed .
UTAH: Who 's the girl ?
TYLER: Catch of the day .
UTAH: Oh , oh . That sounds personal .
TYLER: People are expendable to Bodhi .
UTAH: Meaning you were expendable .
TYLER: We went out for about five minutes which is four minutes longer than most of them . But you ca n't hold it against him , he 's different .
UTAH: Sure , he 's `` the Bodhisattva '' .
TYLER: Yeah , he thinks he 's evolved to a higher plane of existence , o something . Maybe he has . You 've seen him surf that frenzy . It seems like anger . It 's not . It 's the energy of lovemaking . The sea is the woman in his life . She 's his only true lover .
UTAH: All she does is beat the shit out of me .
NATHANIEL: Okay , so you 're in the face , it 's twenty-five feet straight down , your balls are about this big . And the whole thing 's moving , right , oaring like you 're stuck to the front of a freight train . There ai n't nothin ' like it , man . The ultimate rush . Forget about sex , it does n't even come close .
ROACH: You lose it right then , you 're history . The fish 'll be pickin ' you outta the coral .
NATHANIEL: Thanks , brah .
ROACH: See , it 's all dynamic , it 's all in motion . You ca n't just stop and walk on in to the beach if you do n't like the way things are going , y ' know what I mean ? You got ta ride it out man , all the way .
GROMMET: You ride the monsters , you got ta know you 're ridin ' a line between life and death . There ai n't no forgiveness .
UTAH: So what 's the biggest ? Waimea ?
GROMMET: Shit , yeah ! I remember that day gnarly fuckin ' ass ! Was you irthday
ROACH: The set was northwest . Jacking up like a fucking mountain of gray glass
BODHI: I made that one mistake you pray you 'll never make
NATHANIEL: You shoulda fuckin ' seen it it was like he fell for-ever . Then the curl crashes down and he 's gooone
GROMMET: held down in the washing machine , man it was severe , we could n't see nothin ' thought it was all ove for sure Nathaniel HOWLS .
BODHI: Not tragic to die doing what you love . You want the ultimate thrill , you got ta be willing to pay the ultimate price .
NATHANIEL: Fuckin ' A .
GROMMET: Hell , I ai n't gon na see 30 .
UTAH: Uh . I need another beer . He heads out after Tyler .
TYLER: Bunch of goddamn adrenaline junkies . I hope you 're not buying into this anzai-bullshit like the rest of Bodhi 's moonies .
UTAH: What are you talking about ?
TYLER: I 've seen that kamikaze look , Johnny . You 've got it . And Bodhi can smell it a mile away . He 'll take you to the edge and past it . Hey , Bodhi . Utah turns . Bodhi is in the doorway .
BODHI: Johnny has his own demons , do n't you , Johnny ? Bodhi seems to stare into him .
UTAH: What 's goin ' on ?
TYLER: Swell 's here , Johnny . Bodhi always knows .
BODHI: Let 's go , Utah . Time for a little stealth mission .
ROACH: Gaping barrels ! Way overhead , man !
UTAH: I can barely do this in broad daylight .
TYLER: Come on . At least no one 's gon na see how bad you are .
UTAH: I got ta be fucking crazy .
BODHI: Yeah , but are you crazy enough ?
UTAH: I know that part . Tell me something I can use , here .
BODHI: I 've watched you once or twice . You surf like it 's some kind of street fight . You jerk along from moment to moment , fighting everything that comes at you . Always trying to win .
UTAH: A flaw I 'm working on .
BODHI: The only way to win out here is to surrender . You have to feel what the wave is doing , accept its energy , get in sync . Just feel it all moving in the blackness you do n't need to see .
UTAH: Yeah , right , vision is highly over- ated .
BODHI: This one 's got your name on it , Johnny .
UTAH: Shit , I 'm gon na die . I 'm gon na die now .
TYLER: You had enough ?
UTAH: Yeah . I just want to sit out here for a minute .
TYLER: Look at you .
UTAH: What ?
TYLER: Well , usually you have this sort of intense scowl of concentration , like you 're doing this for a school project or something I do n't know , like something 's driving you . See , it 's gone . If I did n't know etter I 'd say you looked almost happy .
UTAH: I I do n't know . I ca n't describe what I 'm feeling .
TYLER: You do n't have to .
UTAH: Goosebumps . Come here .
TYLER: Those are cold .
UTAH: Warm them up . She moves his strong hand onto her breast .
COLE: You 're late . We hear Pappas ' voice over the radio .
UTAH: Right here , partner .
PAPPAS: Good of you to join us , hotshot . Watch it . I told you , not on the hairs , goddammit .
UTAH: I 'm ready to rock , Angelo . Where you want me ?
PAPPAS: Cole and Munoz are going in the back door . Babbit is backing me . So I want you at the side window by the hedge . You 're strictly backup , got it ?
UTAH: Got it .
PAPPAS: Awright . Get into position . I 'm olling .
FIBERGLASS: Yeah ? What ?

FIBERGLASS: No . UTAH blinks at what he sees . HIS POV , in the little mirror .
UTAH: Babbit . Get Angelo out of there . They 're pulling out a fucking arsenal ! Babbit , you copy ? Cole ? Do n't let him pull his badge !
MUNOZ: Utah , say again . What ? I ca n't hear jack shit over this lawnmower . Christ .
BUNKER: Something 's goin ' down , man . This ai n't right .
TONE: No , man , it 's nothin ' . It 's nothin ' .
BUNKER: Will you shut the fuck up ! Check the windows . Do it ! !
PAPPAS: You sure he is n't out back ? You mind if I go take a look ?
FIBERGLASS: Look , I do n't know anything about your dog , okay
PAPPAS: Well is there anyone else here that might have seen him ?
FIBERGLASS: There 's nobody else here
WARCHILD: There 's two guys by the back door . Ducked down .
TONE: Oh , shit . Shit ! ! We 're fucked , man .
BUNKER: That fat fuck comes through the doo I 'm gon na pump him up . Swear to Christ , man , I 'm gon na blow the dude up !
PAPPAS: FBI , gorgeous . Now let 's take a look around

PAPPAS: Speak into the microphone .

DIETZ: You think I like this haircut ? My wife wants me to stay at Ramada I een working on these guys for THREE MONTHS ! Finally finally I get dickwad in there wantin ' to play wheel of fortune so I can find out their supplier !
HARP: This is agent Dietz , DEA . He 's got a record of your suspect 's movements every day for the last three months .
DIETZ: All I wan na know is how are these guys supposed to be holding up Tarzana City National on August 2nd , when they are in Fort-fucking- Lauderdale August 2ND ! ! !
HARP: Not an easy thing to do , is it , Utah ?
UTAH: Aw shit .

PAPPAS: Did he rob it ?
UTAH: Cute . He was inside for about 20 minutes . The other guy , Roach , waited in the truck . They were scoping it out , right ? !
PAPPAS: Last time you got a feeling I had to kill a man , which I always hate ecause it looks bad on the report .
UTAH: Angelo I 'm right this time . We can still win this one .
PAPPAS: Alright , look banks are closed . Nothing 's gon na go down tonight , ight ? So we 'll be on these guys like white on rice first thing tomorrow morning . Okay ? Tomorrow . Okay ?

PAPPAS: Sure . No problem . I 'll just call up and tell him his favorite agent saw this one surfer moon anothe surfer yesterday and it looked real suspicious . Shit , he 'll probably call out the National Guard .
UTAH: I say we do n't call it in . Under no circumstance are we to call this in .
PAPPAS: Look , we handle it ourselves , fo ight now , okay ? We cover the bank , whatever . You and me . That way if nothing happens , or more accurately , when nothing happens I do n't get my tits any further into the wringe than they already are .
UTAH: Angelo , it 's eleven thirty .

TYLER: So what 'd the other guy look like ?
UTAH: Never saw him , was your basic hit and run .
TYLER: But you look like you been in a train wreck , how 'd he just drive away ?
UTAH: I 'm glad you pulled me out of the water that day

TYLER: Fuck you , Johnny Utah . Fuck you ! ! Do n't you have a soul ? Goddamn you to hell !
UTAH: Tyler ! Wait ! !
BODHI: Howdy brah .
UTAH: What going on , Bodhi ?
BODHI: Here . Hey , what happened ? Ya cut yourself shaving ? Johnny meets Bodhi 's cold stare .
UTAH: I do n't think I wan na surf right now . Bodhi 's face takes on a crazy glow .
BODHI: Naw , this is different , Johnny . This is something totally different you 're gon na love this .
UTAH: How you figure ?
BODHI: News , last night those guys , the Ex-Presidents they robbed my bank yesterday . And I was just there the day before , cashing a check . See look . Assured Trust same place .
UTAH: Takes guts to rob a bank . All that adrenalin pumping , waving loaded guns , taking out the guards , getting everybody on the floor , neve knowin ' who 's gon na burst in wondering what it 's like to take a bullet . Must be some ride .
BODHI: Banks are insured , brah . Long as nobody gets shot , it 's really a victimless crime . Just got ta scare 'em a little , would be my guess . Now if I was gon na rob a bank , with all those guys wearin ' body armo these days , know what I 'd carry ? Bodhi reaches his hand underneath the seat .
UTAH: One shot stopping .
BODHI: 'One shot stopping ' good , very good . I like you , Johnny . I like you because you 'll sacrifice anything to win . I respect that . It elevates you a little above the drones who have learned compromise . Here , hold it . Check out the weight .
UTAH: Nice . He hands the smoking weapon back to him . As if to say `` two can play this game '' . Bodhi stands challenged . Each snared in the other 's power
BODHI: It 's a special day , Johnny U . A very special day Utah 's gaze travels beyond the windshield .
UTAH: Once .
BODHI: Pure adrenalin , right ? ! The ultimate rush . Other guys snort fo it , jab a vein for it all you got ta do is jump .
UTAH: Sure , it 's a blast , but listen , I sorta screwed up my knee yesterday
BODHI: Yeah , I noticed you limping . But do n't worry about it , brah . Do n't worry at all . We 're not gon na land on land !
UTAH: Oh , well , that 's fine then . I feel so much better .
BODHI: It 's a little ceremony we always have at the end of summer . One last speedstar .
UTAH: So , who uh , who packed my chute ?
BODHI: I did . What 's the matter ? Do n't trust me ?
UTAH: You got ta earn trust .
BODHI: Then we 'll earn it together . Here , take mine . Bodhi swaps chutes with Johnny . Utah looks at the new chute uncertainly . Is this a game ? Poker moves ? Did Bodhi anticipate this step ?
ROACH: Hey you do n't want Bodhi 's , man . His pack-jobs suck they only open half the time . Take Grommet 's , man .
GROMMET: Whoa , unfair , dude !
UTAH: We gon na jump or jerk off ?
BODHI: My man !
ROACH: Whip it out dudes ! Cheap sex with the cosmos !
BODHI: Ten thousand feet . Let 's do it . The group stabilizes , moving together .
GROMMET: Righteous-ass speedstar , dudes !
BODHI: You diggin ' this ?
UTAH: Great ! GREAT !
BODHI: Purty-thirty and we 're meat waffles , folks . See ya downtown !
UTAH: After you , Alfonse . I insist !
BODHI: Do n't screw around man , pull it !
UTAH: You do it you first !
BODHI: One thousand feet . Pull the goddamn cord !
UTAH: You first !
BODHI: Okay !
UTAH: Jesus Christ . I got ta be losin ' it .
BODHI: Ya see I told you Johnny U was gon na be just fine !
UTAH: What 's this ?
BODHI: Insurance policy . Now this is going to sting a bit , but it 's for you own growth , brah . Press play .
UTAH: You 're a fucking dead man
BODHI: Whoa , whoa ! ! Think it through ! I 'm the only one knows where they are . Just let me talk for a second . Johnny pulls back . Barely in control .
UTAH: Talk .
BODHI: She 'll be fine , Rosie wo n't do anything . At least not as long as I meet him at a certain place and time , about let 's see six hours from now . Utah 's voice sounds kind of strangled .
UTAH: You call him right now and tell him to let her go .
BODHI: Sorry , ca n't do it , brah . He 's on the road . And where they 're going there 's no phones . Damn , I hate this Johnny , I really do . I hate violence . See , that 's why I need Rosie . I could never make this thing work , myself . No way I could hold a knife to Tyler 's throat , man ! She was my woman , once . We shared time in this world . But Rosie , he 's kind of a mechanism . Once you set him in motion , he wo n't stop . That 's his gift , a kind of lankness . Noon comes , straight up , he 'll gut her like a pig and try not to get any on his shoes . Nothing I can do , unless I get there .
UTAH: We 're wasting time .
BODHI: See ! That 's what I like about you , man ! You 're just sharp as a razo lade .
ROACH: Peace through superior firepower , abe .
BODHI: Here , you need this . You ca n't be comin ' through that door with you dick in your hands , right ?
UTAH: I ca n't do this .
BODHI: Sure you can ! You may even like it it 's a killer rush . You 'll see . Hey , do n't I show you things , Johnny U ?
UTAH: Bodhi , this is your wake up call , man I am an Eff Bee Eye Agent ! !
BODHI: Wild , ai n't it ? ! See , we exist on a higher plane , you and I . We make our own rules . Why be a servant of the law Johnny U when you can be it 's master ?
GROMMET: Fuckin ' A !
BODHI: Ninety seconds , man , door to door . A small price to pay for someone who loves you . She does you know . It 's not he style to fall so hard I do n't think she did with me .
GROMMET: Do n't fucking do it , man !
UTAH: On the floor , asshole ! What 's you problem ? ! I blow your fucking kneecaps out , you 'll be on the floor ! ! The guy hits the deck like a sack of cement .
MISS JENNINGS: He he he has the keys . Mr. Duggan .
DUGGAN: Do whatever they say , Terry . MISS JENNINGS hurries to comply .
UTAH: You 're blowing it , man ! You 're eaking your own rules pulling too much time !
BODHI: Do n't anybody fucking move !
GROMMET: Oh no , oh my god , oh god it 's all comin ' out man , got ta stop it it 's all gon na come out do something ! !
ROACH: We got ta bug out , man ! We 're eatin ' it bad on this one . Let 's go !
BODHI: Goodbye , Johnny .
MUNOZ: if you so desire , an attorney will be provided for you free of cost . Do you understand these ights I have explained to you ? Utah ?
PAPPAS: He knows his goddamn rights ! Jesus , kid . I knew you were getting too close to these guys . Gim me the goddamn key to these things , Cole . Christ !
HARP: Do n't take those off . Just leave them on ! Your partner 's an accessory to murder . You realize that ?
UTAH: Take your hand off my shoulder right now .
PAPPAS: Look , Harp . Do n't turn him over to the uniforms like some punk . Let me ide him in .
HARP: Yeah , sure . Why not ? You two screw-ups deserve each other . That 's why I put you together in the first place . Christ Pappas , you 're as bad as he is talk about the lind leading the blind Pappas steps close to the Supervising Agent .
PAPPAS: Harp , let me tell you something . I was an agent in this bureau when your mommy was still wiping you shinny pink ass , and you know one thing I learned in all those years that you still have n't ?
HARP: What that ?
PAPPAS: Respect your elders . Let 's go kid .
UTAH: I know where they 're going .
PAPPAS: Figured you did . Angelo flips Johnny the key .
UTAH: Only problem is we ca n't arrest them or shoot them . ON PAPPAS ' `` what the fuck ? ! '' expression we
BODHI: But you 're not alone .
UTAH: Good guess . There 's a gun on you ight now .
BODHI: Around somewhere . Listen , I 'm in kind of a hurry , Johnny U . What can I do for you ?
UTAH: You got ta tell me where she is .
BODHI: And let my policy expire ? Sorry .
UTAH: Look , Bodhi man . People are dead . The ride is over .
BODHI: I say when it 's over !
UTAH: The guy you killed was an off duty cop ! If you get out of here they 'll nail you wherever you land . They have a new thing called radar . Maybe you 've heard of it .
BODHI: Back in the hotseat , campadre .
UTAH: Angelo ! Do n't fire !
PAPPAS: Kid , get outta the way ! !

BANDIT #20: What do you got in there ?
LEAD BANDIT: Shut up . What do you got in there ?
THE POSTMAN: Dried peas . Beef jerky . Cigarettes .
BANDIT #20: Maybe he 's got it booby-trapped .
LEAD BANDIT: You go up and get it .
BANDIT #20: Maybe he fell asleep .
THE POSTMAN: It 's going to take a second . I got my stuff bolted in .

MRS. THOMPSON: The children have never heard Shakespeare before .
THE POSTMAN: They still have n't . The Curmudgeon is still clapping .
CURMUDGEON LARRY: I 'm clapping because you stink .
THE POSTMAN: I do n't think you understand how it works .
CURMUDGEON LARRY: When I was young , I tried to be an actor . I was awful . But now I wo n't die thinking I was the worst one .
THE POSTMAN: I 'm glad I could help .
MRS. THOMPSON: Larry , stop it . You were very good .
THE POSTMAN: Good enough to get something to eat ? Before she can answer , a SENTRY cries
SENTRY: Holnists ! Holnists are coming !
MRS. THOMPSON: It 's okay . We give them food and supplies . All the towns do .

THE POSTMAN: Well , I 'd just as soon not give them anything of mine . Let 's find the back door , Bill .
BETHLEHEM: I said , what are you doing ?
MAYOR: It 's just a game , General Bethlehem . Something they saw in a play . No harm in it .
BETHLEHEM: A play ? Show me . It 's all right , children , show me . One BRAVE BOY finds his voice , barely .
BRAVE BOY: Arm , arm yourselves ! No running from the witches !
BETHLEHEM: Shakespeare , is it ? Well , I 'm sorry I missed it .
MAYOR: You should know , sir , we have n't nearly stocked the game we thought we would .
BETHLEHEM: Really ? But you had time for a play ?
IDAHO: All men between 15 and 50 and of suitable ethnic foundation are equired to show themselves now .
BETHLEHEM: Acceptable .
IDAHO: Sir ?
BETHLEHEM: Acceptable , Captain !

THE POSTMAN: You do n't understand
IDAHO: You were required to show yourself .
THE POSTMAN: But , I 'm not with these people . I 'm just passing through . I
BANDIT #20: Hi .
THE POSTMAN: Hi ?
BANDIT #20: Well I mean , we know each other , kind of
THE POSTMAN: Kind of .
BANDIT #20: Wow !
THE POSTMAN: So what did you guys do with my cigarettes ?
BANDIT #20: We traded them for a woman .
THE POSTMAN: Wonderful . What happened to you partners ?
BANDIT #20: They traded me to the Holnists .
BETHLEHEM: Welcome , gentlemen , to your new life . You have been born again as soldiers in the army of the United Clans of Holn . The strong have een sapped by the whimpering propaganda of the weak . Men , strong men , have been denied thei destiny . You men have been saved from that fate . Redemption is within your grasp .
GANGLY RECRUIT: I had a shovel . I digged holes . Bethlehem regards him benevolently .
BETHLEHEM: You digged holes Well , now you 're going to fill them . And you ?
THE POSTMAN: Me ?
BETHLEHEM: Is there any question in anyone 's mind that I was talking to you ? Yes , you . You look like a dangerous man . Are you ?
THE POSTMAN: I 'm just a performer . Shakespeare . Stuff like that .
BETHLEHEM: Shakespeare ?
THE POSTMAN: He was a writer . He
BETHLEHEM: I know who Shakespeare was 'Cry `` Havoc ! '' and let slip the dogs of war . '
THE POSTMAN: I , um , you want a line ?
BETHLEHEM: 'We few , we happy few , we band of others . '
THE POSTMAN: 'Now is the winter of ou discontent made glorious summer by this son of York . ' Bethlehem claps The Postman on the back .
BETHLEHEM: You 're pretty good . You 're also a fighter . I see it in your eyes .
THE POSTMAN: I do n't mean any disrespect , sir , ut you 'd be better off just letting me go . A fighter is about the last thing I am .
BETHLEHEM: Do n't you think I should be the judge of that , soldier ? The Postman gasps to catch his breath .
THE POSTMAN: You 'd win .
BETHLEHEM: Now fight .
THE POSTMAN: Thanks . Did I win ? Woody shakes his head `` no . ''
WOODY: Say it again .
THE POSTMAN: Say what ?
WOODY: The words you said in town . About the wind blowing . And the rest Say it again .
THE POSTMAN: 'Blow , wind . Come wrack . At least we 'll die with the harness off our back . '
WOODY: What 's it mean ?
THE POSTMAN: Live free or die .
IDAHO: All right , girls . We 're gon na un . Twenty miles . With packs . You got three hours . Everybody makes it . Or nobody eats .
IDAHO: Eat up ! You got meat tonight .
COOK: Mule .
IDAHO: A godawful animal . The sterile offspring of a horse and a donkey . Can you imagine that ? ! There 's no oom in this new world for a astard like that .
BANDIT #20: I 'll die before I 'm last in line again .
THE POSTMAN: That 's what they 're hoping for . He holds his pail out to Bandit # 20 .
BANDIT #20: Serious ? This is n't bad .
THE POSTMAN: These were supposed to be the best years of my life .
BETHLEHEM: The laws of eight , gentlemen . That is the legacy handed down to us by Nathan Holn .
RECRUITS: God rest his soul !
THE POSTMAN: May he burn in hell .
BETHLEHEM: These are the laws that we live y . The eight is our symbol . Each man will bear it with pride .
SLOW RECRUIT: There were n't enough chairs .
BETHLEHEM: I did n't specify chairs . You could 've sat down on the ground . The Slow Recruit moves to do so .
SLOW RECRUIT: Please , I 'm begging you .
BETHLEHEM: You will get out of this army what you put into it . Work and you 'll e fed . Fight and you 'll be espected . Die and you 'll be emembered . It 's up to you .
IDAHO: You thinking of challenging fo leadership of the clan ?
THE POSTMAN: No , sir . I 'm a follower not a leader .
IDAHO: You see Colonel Getty ? Always following the General ? He 's the only man who ever challenged . Fight lasted six seconds , but the General did n't kill him . He cut off his tongue and he cut off his alls and old Getty 's been following him like a dog eve since .
IDAHO: The General would like a word with you , Shakespeare .
BETHLEHEM: They 're yours . A solitary man , are n't you ? Binoculars . To watch life from a distance . And Shakespeare . To read about it instead of living it .
THE POSTMAN: No offense , General , but you seem to have read some Shakespeare yourself .
BETHLEHEM: If he wishes to rise above mere thuggery , a military commandee must be classically educated . Philosophy , history . Even a sense of the dramatic . Do you know what I did before the war ? Do you think I was in the army ? I sold copying machines . I was a salesman . The talent to lead men and devise and execute a attle plan were locked away inside me .
BETHLEHEM: If Nathan Holn had n't come along , I 'd still be selling copying machines . Can you imagine the wasted life ? Can you imagine the magnitude of it ? But war Wa gives men like me a chance . He turns to a dog-eared page in the book .
IDAHO: And the book , sir ?
BETHLEHEM: Burn it .
BANDIT #20: What happened ?
THE POSTMAN: Nothing .
BANDIT #20: Did he say anything about me ?
THE POSTMAN: No .
BANDIT #20: What are you talking about ?
THE POSTMAN: Escaping . You ever hear of St. Rose ? It 's on the coast . They say it 's a paradise . They 've even got electric lights . Bandit # 20 looks scared , Woody unreadable .
BANDIT #20: We ca n't .
THE POSTMAN: Between the three of us , we could
BANDIT #20: No , no . I ca n't . I like it here . I like being a part of something .
IDAHO: One of you dogs has earned himself a treat . Over there .
BANDIT #20: I 'll go . Idaho ignores him , stops in front of Woody .
IDAHO: I guess size ai n't a measure of courage , is it ? Shakespeare !
BETHLEHEM: Come out alive and you got yourself a lion steak .
IDAHO: Maybe you 'll find your St. Rose up there .
THE POSTMAN: I found him .
IDAHO: Hurry up ! You still got a lion to ag !
BETHLEHEM: In the water . Come back without him and you and another man will die in his place .
CONSCRIPTS: Go ! Go !
BANDIT #20: I 'll get him , sir . He takes off running across the bridge .
THE POSTMAN: Just let me go . I do n't want to e part of your army .
BANDIT #20: My army . I like the sound of that . The Postman gestures with his knife .
THE POSTMAN: Do n't
BANDIT #20: I got him ! Over
WOODY: They sent me to kill you .
THE POSTMAN: Come with me .
IDAHO: Good , boy . Get him .

BETHLEHEM: Do you know what system of government we have here , son ? A feudal system . Like the Middle Ages . With lords and vassals . That 's you and me . Those lords , they had some ideas . If a vassal got married , it was the lord 's ight , his right , to sleep with the bride on the wedding night .

BRISCOE: East .
BETHLEHEM: Send a patrol east . Send three more south , north and west . They 'd better find him east .
FORD: I managed to save these .

MAN #3: How much is it to mail a letter ?
THE POSTMAN: A buck seventy-five .
MAN #3: That sounds awful cheap .
THE POSTMAN: The catch is the only currency ecognized are silver American coins minted before 1964 and two dollar bills . Look for Thomas Jefferson . Of course , food is always acceptable as barter . The moment is split by a SIREN .

BETHLEHEM: What ?
GIBBS: They say they got a representative of the restored United States in there . They say this army is illegal . They say
CHUBBY SENTRY: Drop dead and go to hell !

THE POSTMAN: You do n't . Negotiate a settlement . Give them extra supplies .
MAYOR: Okay . You 're a government rep. You go tell them . The look on The Postman 's face says it all .
BETHLEHEM: Make it quick . I 've got an attack to coordinate .
THE POSTMAN: General , um , they 've asked me to negotiate a peace treaty .

THE POSTMAN: The new capital is based in Minneapolis . Inside the Hubert Humphrey Metrodome . You know , where the Vikings used to play ?
BETHLEHEM: You 're funny . Now , what are the terms ?
THE POSTMAN: They 'll open the gate and give you double what they usually give . Just do n't hurt anybody . This was all a misunderstanding . Bethlehem thinks this over .
BETHLEHEM: Appreciate your offer , Postman . Problem is , you 're in no position to negotiate . These people made it through the bugs and the riots and the three year winter . But they 're not going to survive you .
CAPTAIN: In accordance with law eight and y the authority of Emergency Order 46 , you are hereby

ABBY: They killed Michael .
THE POSTMAN: I 'm sorry .
ABBY: How sorry are you ?
THE POSTMAN: What 's that supposed to mean ?
ABBY: You got the mark of eight on you .
THE POSTMAN: A mark does n't mean I 'm a
ABBY: You 're a liar . I should 've let you die .
THE POSTMAN: Then , why did n't you ? If she knows , she 's not ready to say yet .
THE POSTMAN: You were with Bethlehem . Does that make you one of them ?
ABBY: Anything else ?
THE POSTMAN: I did n't mean for you to
ABBY: Your legs are going to rot off if you do n't try to walk .
THE POSTMAN: I 'm hurt .
ABBY: You 're lazy .
THE POSTMAN: Lazy ? ! I got a hole in my stomach . I 'm weak . The two big meals around here are grass and snow . And we 're running out of grass .
ABBY: This is the last of it .
THE POSTMAN: Give me a break
ABBY: I 'm going to check the pass .
THE POSTMAN: Why are you in such a hurry to get out of here ? I can think of worse places . And worse company to And with the SLAM of the DOOR she is gone .
ABBY: Help !
THE POSTMAN: I ca n't help you .
ABBY: I told you that 's all there was .
THE POSTMAN: That 's why you should have it .
ABBY: I knew you could walk .
THE POSTMAN: You 're weird , you know that ?
ABBY: So ? What good is that now ?
THE POSTMAN: Obviously you 've forgotten Tang and microwave ovens . Your face looks pretty . Abby looks up .
ABBY: Look , there 's something you 'd etter know . You 're going to find out soon enough . I 'm pregnant . It 's Michael 's baby . You 're just the body father .
THE POSTMAN: How do you know it 's mine and not Bethlehem 's ?
ABBY: He tried with me almost every night . He could n't do it . So he eat me . Said it was my fault .
THE POSTMAN: Abby .
ABBY: The pass is clear . It 's time to go .
THE POSTMAN: What happened ?
ABBY: Of course .
THE POSTMAN: Of course ? I do n't understand .
ABBY: I set the fire .
THE POSTMAN: Am I missing the point here ?
ABBY: You did n't think we 'd stay here forever , did you ? I 'd appreciate if you 'd walk with me long enough to find someplace safe for the baby . Then we can split up . You shaved . The Postman has all but forgotten .
THE POSTMAN: Yeah
ABBY: It looks nice .
THE POSTMAN: You 're really weird , you know that ?
ABBY: I 've heard people talk . I 've heard lots of names . Bliss . Hesperia . New Eden . Sheriff Briscoe says it 's a fantasy .
THE POSTMAN: He 's wrong . St. Rose is out there . And I 'm going to find it .
ABBY: But you 're The Postman .

RIDER: Me neither , mister .
ABBY: What are you ?
THE POSTMAN: That 's impossible .
PONYTAIL: Ai n't you heard of The Postman ?
ABBY: No , tell us .
PONYTAIL: He 's only the greatest man who ever lived . He crossed the wasteland , shook his fist at the enemy and spit in the eye of General Bethlehem himself . He 's ack east with President Starkey ight now .
THE POSTMAN: Who told you all this ?
PONYTAIL: Postmaster Ford Lincoln Mercury . He 's in direct contact with the estored congress .
THE POSTMAN: Direct contact I do n't believe this .
PONYTAIL: Do you have mail , or do n't you ?
THE POSTMAN: You said Carrier Eighteen . That mean there 's eighteen of you ?
PONYTAIL: Thirty-two . As of midnight .

CHUBBY: Did you get a letter or did n't you ?
FORD: Gather 'round , everybody . Got another letter here . Came in last night .
THE POSTMAN: What 's all this ?
YOUNG CARRIER: Postman sent Ford another letter . He 's gon na read it .
FORD: 'Hello , all postal carriers . '
CARRIERS: Hello !
FORD: I 'm here in Minneapolis with President Starkey , but my thoughts are with you . Remember , nothing worth doing can be done overnight . Keep your chins up and do you est not to get shot . Signed , The Postman .
PONYTAIL: His letters are always kind of short . Abby and The Postman exchange a look .
FORD: Hold on now . There 's a P.S Anybody know what P.S . stands for ?
CHUBBY: Holy shit
RED: That would be H.S. , Chubby .
CHUBBY: I seen him once when I lived in Benning . It 's The Postman ! Word goes through the crowd like a wave . The Postman takes the letter , reads .
THE POSTMAN: P.S . Ford knows what to do . Ford shrugs sheepishly .
FORD: Guess you want to talk about this ?
PONYTAIL: I found him ! I found him ! They clamor around her .
THE POSTMAN: President Starkey ? Minneapolis ? Ford knows what to do ?
FORD: I thought you were dead .
THE POSTMAN: So ? I 'm not making the connection . What 's all this then ?
FORD: I lied . I told people you were in contact with me .
THE POSTMAN: Why ?
FORD: Because I did n't want it to end .
THE POSTMAN: I do n't know how long I can stay , Ford . President Starkey will send word one day and I 'll have to move on . Understand ?
FORD: Sure . But you 'll stay till he sends word ? Right ?
THE POSTMAN: Aw , do n't do that . Hands down .
FORD: You 'll stay 'til President Starkey sends word , right ? Right ?
THE POSTMAN: Yeah , till he sends word , right . Ford smiles , gestures to the carriers .
FORD: Could you say a few words ?
THE POSTMAN: Two plus two equals four .
FORD: We bring all the mail here first . We sort it , group it and then it goes out . So far we got thirty outes .
THE POSTMAN: You spelled tyranny wrong .
CHUBBY: Boy , he 's smart .
THE POSTMAN: How old are you ?
OLD GEORGE: Seventy-five , sir . The Postman looks over at Ford , who shrugs .
THE POSTMAN: Can you ride ?
OLD GEORGE: Nope . Ca n't walk too good , either .
THE POSTMAN: Why are you here ?
OLD GEORGE: I know stuff . The Postman looks at Ford again . Then
THE POSTMAN: When did you get that ?
OLD GEORGE: 1970 . A girl with eyes as big as saucers did me in a little town called Saigon .
THE POSTMAN: Abby
ABBY: Yes ?
THE POSTMAN: Ford wants me to have his trailer . Said it 's the best one .
ABBY: I 'm on the other side of town .
THE POSTMAN: I got plenty of room here .
BETHLEHEM: What do you think , Lieutenant ?
GIBBS: Ca n't tell what it is if you stand too close . The colors all kinda un together , do n't they ?
BETHLEHEM: Yes
GIBBS: We captured him on the Oregon order .
BETHLEHEM: Who the hell are you ?
GIBBS: Yes , sir . Bethlehem looks back to Carrier Twelve .
BETHLEHEM: You spelled tyranny wrong .
THE POSTMAN: I wish they 'd stop saluting .
CHUBBY: Boy , he 's smart .
THE POSTMAN: What the hell ?

BRISCOE: I 'll be damned .
FORD: Bethlehem is offering a 1000 pounds of gold to whoever brings you in . Dead or alive .
THE POSTMAN: Thank God it was n't a carton of cigarettes .
BRISCOE: I 'd have shot you myself .
THE POSTMAN: Got a letter for you , Sheriff .
BRISCOE: It 's from my sister . I thought she was dead .
THE POSTMAN: You thought wrong .
THE POSTMAN: Tell me about the baby , Abby . I want to know .
GIBBS: Births and deaths , the weather , gossip . There 's nothing here .
BETHLEHEM: Nothing ? Everything is here . Am I the only one who sees that ? Get out !
BETHLEHEM: A military man , especially a commander , should keep a journal . After he 's gone , it 's the only eal defense against the slande that arises .
THE POSTMAN: Who do you talk to ?
OLD GEORGE: Not a soul in seven years of trying . But I will .
THE POSTMAN: No . No thanks . Hey , do n't let the kids see that .
OLD GEORGE: I was an aerospace engineer . I helped design the Galileo space station . I dream it 's orbiting Earth forever . With a dozen human skeletons all grinning at each other . Laughing at us down here .
THE POSTMAN: What is it ?
FORD: It 's Red . He 's overdue .
THE POSTMAN: That makes five . All on Southern outes .
BETHLEHEM: No . No . Not him . No . Children . I want a man and you ing me children !
GIBBS: Not yet . General wants the message to get back .
THE POSTMAN: Tell me about the other stuff you know
SENTRY: Halt ! Identify yourself !
BETHLEHEM: Postage due
ABBY: Ford 's idea .
THE POSTMAN: Figures . They do n't think to ask who they 're replacing . Or why .
LUKE: Sir ? It 'd be an honor if I could shake your hand .
THE POSTMAN: You look like Do I know you ?
LUKE: No , sir .
THE POSTMAN: Well , good luck to you . Nodding in awe , Luke heads off .
ABBY: You 're exhausted . You need rest . There 's food in the trailer
THE POSTMAN: Where are you going ?
PONYTAIL: Route twenty-two . I 'm already an hour late .
THE POSTMAN: You 're grounded . Get off the horse . You know the rule .
PONYTAIL: What rule ?
THE POSTMAN: Twenty-two 's too far south .
PONYTAIL: But they 're waiting on their mail down there .
THE POSTMAN: Get off the goddamn horse .
ABBY: You ca n't keep doing this .
THE POSTMAN: Doing what ?
ABBY: Riding all the routes . You 're not saving anyone .
THE POSTMAN: Did I ever tell you how I got to e a postman , Abby ? I do n't know if you 'd laugh o cry .
GIBBS: Ready !
SOLDIER: The post office , General ?
BETHLEHEM: No . Let it stand . All by itself . So it can remind them what it cost them .
GIBBS: Aim ! Rifles are aimed .
BETHLEHEM: You think you can ride ? Then today 's your lucky day .
BLOODIED CARRIER: Bethlehem says
FORD: What are you going to do ?
THE POSTMAN: I 'm going to stop this .
FORD: You ca n't .
THE POSTMAN: Get out of my way , Ford . All of you .
FORD: They 'll kill you .
THE POSTMAN: Goddamnit
FORD: You ca n't help them !
THE POSTMAN: There 's still time , Ford !
PONYTAIL: You 're hurting him . But there 's no let-up .
FORD: No , this is all my doing . I went against your orders . There 's a moment of shocked surprise .
THE POSTMAN: Why ?
FORD: Because Bethlehem has to know that we 're not going to stop .
THE POSTMAN: God damn you , Ford . Those people down there are dying because of us . Because of what we did .
FORD: Bullshit . They 're dying because of Bethlehem . They 're dying ecause this is a shitty world . And if we 're ever going to change it , then somebody might have to die . If I could make it be me down there I would . But I ca n't . A terrible SCREAM gives them all pause .
THE POSTMAN: My God , what have I done ? We do n't even know their names
PONYTAIL: We know their names . The little one 's my brother . His name is Billy . A moment of stunned silence .
BETHLEHEM: He 's out there somewhere . Watching . I can feel it .
GIBBS: Ready ! Aim !
BRISCOE: Ride , Postman ! Ride ! You hea me ? I said ride !
BETHLEHEM: Fire ! The RIFLES BARK . Everyone falls dead .
ABBY: Ford thinks you 're going to do something .
THE POSTMAN: I am .
ABBY: Ford does n't know what it means to e a kid . He does n't have you memories . None of them do . All they 've got is the lousy world we gave them . And this is the only decent thing in it .
THE POSTMAN: What ? Being a postman ? It 's all ullshit , Abby . All of it . I took this uniform off a skeleton to stay warm . I made up the rest to stay fed . There is no restored United States .
ABBY: I knew it was something like that .
THE POSTMAN: Weird thing is , being a Postman was almost the best thing that ever happened to me Remember this ? You left it behind that night .
ABBY: I remember
THE POSTMAN: I always liked to think you left it on purpose . But maybe you just forgot it . Abby does n't answer . She leaves instead .
FORD: The rest are on the overdue list .
THE POSTMAN: This is everybody . Got a letter from President Starkey .
CARRIERS: Greetings , President Starkey !
THE POSTMAN: ' I 've been in contact with The Postman . I 've received all the eports . I 'm proud of you all . '
THE POSTMAN: In dark days , in a weary world , you gave everything and asked fo nothing . You beat back despai and replaced it with hope and fo that your country can never repay you . But the price is too high . I wo n't see anymore of my bravest die . It is my duty to hereby disband the Postal Service of the estored United States . You are to burn your uniforms and The Postman is to return to Minneapolis at once . Thank you and that is all .
FORD: The President never wrote that letter .
THE POSTMAN: If he could 've that 's what he would have said . Ford gestures to the second letter .
FORD: Who 's the other letter to ?
THE POSTMAN: Bethlehem . I 'm taking it to him in the morning .
FORD: What does it say ?
THE POSTMAN: Mail 's private . You know that .
FORD: What does it say ?
THE POSTMAN: It says it 's over . It says we quit .
FORD: It says you quit . What about the oath ?
THE POSTMAN: Tell me something , Ford . How much mail can a dead postman deliver ? It 's over . The Postman starts to walk away again .
FORD: Then I 'll take it .
THE POSTMAN: I ca n't trust you .
FORD: If this is the end . If this is the last piece of mail that eve gets delivered . I 'll take it .
THE POSTMAN: Whoever takes this letter probably dies for it . Ford thrusts out his hand .
FORD: I 'm still a postman . You owe it to me I owe it to me .
THE POSTMAN: I 'm going to St. Rose , Abby . And I 'm taking you with me . I know you do n't want to hear it , but that 's my child inside you . I want to see it born somewhere safe . I have a right to that , Abby . Whether you like it or not .
THE POSTMAN: Thought I recognized you .
LUKE: General Bethlehem said You should be on your knees when I do it .
THE POSTMAN: I do n't give a damn what that asshole said .
LUKE: The general is a great man .
THE POSTMAN: The general is a fucking lunatic .
THE POSTMAN: You 're a better man than Bethlehem , Luke . I 've seen it .
CHUBBY: Guess Minneapolis is that way .
THE POSTMAN: We ca n't help you . We 're just as lost as you are .
BETHLEHEM: Good lord , what do we have here ?
FORD: I 'm a representative of the estored United States Bethlehem backhands Ford .
GIBBS: He 's got a letter . Says The Postman sent it .
BETHLEHEM: A letter ?
FORD: Traitor
BETHLEHEM: Then I 've won . I 've won .
LUKE: I could n't get close enough . This one 's his second in command . Bethlehem looks Ford over .
BETHLEHEM: Why does n't that surprise me ?
FORD: Who are you ?
CAL CARRIER: Name 's Clark . Postal Carrier of the restored Republic of California . Who are you ?
FORD: Postmaster Ford Lincoln Mercury .
CALI CARRIER: It 's an honor .
BETHLEHEM: Wait a minute wait a minute !
GIBBS: Sir ?
BETHLEHEM: Hold your fire ! You do n't know each other ? This will never be over . It 'll go on except I 'll be fighting a goddamn ghost .
GIBBS: Should we fire , sir ?
BETHLEHEM: No goddamnit . Bethlehem crumples the letter , tosses it .
THE POSTMAN: I do n't know him . Do you ?
ABBY: Where do you think he came from ?
SQUATTER: Howdy . Welcome to sunny California .
THE POSTMAN: What happened here ?
SQUATTER: Little accident . The ground started to shake big time and the Hanford nuclear plant went 'Poof . ' Destroyed everything for miles . But the sunsets are eautiful .
THE POSTMAN: You ever hear of a city called St. Rose ?
SQUATTER: Friend , I 've never heard of St. Shit .
CHUBBY: You think that 's President Starkey ?
PONYTAIL: No .
CHUBBY: What makes you so sure ?
PONYTAIL: President lives in a white house . That guy 's place is gray .
THE POSTMAN: We can rest in there . Abby is quick to agree .
ABBY: I 'm hungry , Postman .
GUARD: Set the rifle on the ground .
THE POSTMAN: This old thing ? It is n't even loaded . Where are we ?
B.C. MAYOR: You 're in Bridge City . Where we do n't allow guns .
THE POSTMAN: I know you . You 're famous .
B.C. MAYOR: I was once . Not anymore . Are you looking to cross ?
THE POSTMAN: We will be . Right now , we 'd just appreciate some food . I got some kids behind me , too .
B.C. MAYOR: How many ?
THE POSTMAN: Three . Hey , guys , come on in ! I know you 're out there !
CHUBBY SENTRY: Boy , is he smart As they stand , show themselves .
B.C. MAYOR: For you and your wife .
THE POSTMAN: Thanks . She 's not my wife .
B.C. MAYOR: St. Rose ?
THE POSTMAN: Yeah !
B.C. MAYOR: Never been . But they say it 's a ways down on the coast .
THE POSTMAN: How far ?
B.C. MAYOR: Couple hundred miles at least . I could n't say for sure .
THE POSTMAN: You seem like a decent man . And these seem like decent people .
B.C. MAYOR: We try to be .
THE POSTMAN: And this seems like a safe place .
B.C. MAYOR: You want to leave her ?
THE POSTMAN: All of them . I 'll give you the horses and my gear . Abby 's special . She 's strong . Probably end up running the place .
B.C. MAYOR: Why do n't you take the night to think . Decide if that 's what you eally want .
B.C. MAYOR: They 're looking for The Postman .
B.C. MAN: No such thing anymore .
B.C. MAYOR: Man on the horse says there is . Says he thinks he 's here . Says he 's coming back with friends . A little BOY steps forward , sings out .
B.C. BOY: What 's a postman ?
ABBY: You never heard of a postman ?
B.C. BOY: Wow
ABBY: My postman knew the name of every kid on my street . He knew ou irthdays . He 'd even find the aseballs you 'd hit down the street . I can still see the smile on his face . The tip of his cap when he had a letter in his bag with my name on it . Mine always came just after school . You could set your watch by him . Unless you were waiting on something special like a present from somewhere far away or a letter from you sweetheart . Then it seemed like he 'd never come . I used to think they could make time stand still .
B.C. MAYOR: Are you The Postman ?
THE POSTMAN: Yes .
B.C. MAYOR: I 've heard of you , man . You 're famous .
THE POSTMAN: Yeah , I guess I am . And all of a sudden , I 'm not wearing the right clothes .
B.C. MAYOR: Fact that we do n't allow 'em does n't mean we do n't have 'em . We 're not stupid , after all .
THE POSTMAN: I 'm sorry I 've brought this on you .
B.C. MAYOR: No need to be sorry . Long as we get our mail on time .
THE POSTMAN: The order was to burn all uniforms . The carriers look away sheepish .
THE POSTMAN: You know what to do then ?
PONYTAIL: Talk to the people . Gather who 's willing . Tell them it 's important . Tell them we can make a difference .
CHUBBY SENTRY: And tell 'em we 're going to kick ass .
THE POSTMAN: Yeah , tell them that , too .
ABBY: This is hard for me . Michael was the best man I eve knew . I never thought there 'd be another man I could love the way I loved him . I do n't know why I 've been so lessed . And I 've tried to find a way to be thankful , but I swear , if I lose you
THE POSTMAN: Abby , do you think a lie can ecome the truth ?
ABBY: I do n't know , but I believe in you . You have a gift , Postman . I saw it back in Pine View .
ABBY: When you come back , we 'll be waiting here for you . So you can take us to St. Rose .
B.C. MAYOR: There 's three good-sized towns up that way . Enough folks to be a ig help to you . If you can convince them to come .
THE POSTMAN: How do I stop
B.C. MAYOR: Do n't worry about it . Good luck and Godspeed .

BETHLEHEM: How many ?
GIBBS: A least a hundred . With guns .
BETHLEHEM: With guns ? Are you sure ?
GIBBS: Yes , sir
BETHLEHEM: Looks more like two hundred to me
THE POSTMAN: Stay here . No one moves until I give the orders .
SERGEANT: Are they surrendering ?
BETHLEHEM: God , I hope not .
THE POSTMAN: We 're both a couple of frauds . You know it ; I know it . Bethlehem sneers .
BETHLEHEM: Great men are made by other great men . Patton had Rommel . Grant had Lee . But I get you .
THE POSTMAN: Would n't it be great if wars could e fought just by the assholes who started them ? We could settle this thing right here . You and me .
BETHLEHEM: Unfortunately , it does n't work that way .
THE POSTMAN: It does in your army .
BETHLEHEM: What ? The Postman wheels his horse around .
THE POSTMAN: I challenge you .
BETHLEHEM: You 're not a Holnist . You 're not a member of the clan . You do n't have the right .
THE POSTMAN: I have every right . I invoke law seven ! Bethlehem ca n't believe his eyes .
BETHLEHEM: Where do I know you from ?
THE POSTMAN: 'Cry Havoc ! And let slip the dogs of war . ' Remember that ?
BETHLEHEM: Shakespeare . The one who did n't want to fight .
THE POSTMAN: I should 've found a way to kill you then . But you seemed so strong .
BETHLEHEM: Law seven it is . This war is settled here !
BETHLEHEM: I study people . I know you problem . Do you know why you ca n't fight ? The Postman ca n't answer .
THE POSTMAN: I believe in the United States Postal Service .
THE POSTMAN: Neither snow Nor rain Nor heat Nor gloom of night Will stay this courier from the swift completion of his appointed ounds
FORD: Law three . Mercy is for the weak .
THE POSTMAN: Ford , do n't
FORD: Law eight . There is only one penalty and that penalty is death . Ford 's going to shoot .
THE POSTMAN: He is n't worth it . I 'm the head of the clan now ! There are going to be new laws ! Law one ! No more killing ! There 's going to be peace !
WOMAN: Everyone has to learn how to read .
THE POSTMAN: That 's law two . Who else ? !
CARRIER #1: Three . Liberty and justice fo all !
LUKE: Four . No more tattoos .
CARRIER #2: Law five . Give peace a chance !
CARRIER #3: Seven ! Bring back vacations ! The Postman nods solemnly , looks to Ford .
THE POSTMAN: How about it , Ford Lincoln Mercury ? You give us law eight . Ford grits his teeth .
FORD: Law eight
FORD: Live and let live .
BETHLEHEM: Would I had bestowed that time in the tongues that I have in fencing , dancing and bear-baiting . Oh , had I but followed the arts He dies .
THE POSTMAN: Grow like savages as soldiers will that nothing do but mediate on blood .
CHUBBY: Huh ?
THE POSTMAN: A letter
ABBY: Your daddy wrote to tell you that he 'll be here as soon as he can . And that he loves you very much .
THE POSTMAN: Mail 's slow . I 'll have to see about that . Abby smiles down at the child in her arms .
ABBY: Your daughter . Her name is Hope . The Postman takes the tiny child in his arms .
HOPE: But he never did see St. Rose . There was too much to be done . He 'd made a promise and in keeping it he traded one dream fo another . With no regrets . And so , in honor of my father
OLDER MAN: That was me . As St. Rose applauds

MORRIE: Well let 's bloody hope so . It 'll e a lonely time without you there .
PK: Morrie Levy . Is that the voice of sentimentality I hear coming from you ?
MORRIE: Sentimentality my ass . Practicality . Where am I going to find a sure thing like you to make book on at bloody Oxford ?
PK: Go on .
MORRIE: You hear Sutcliffe screwed Bartlett 's sister when he stayed with them over holidays ?
PK: I do n't believe it .
MORRIE: I heard it from Bartlett 's own lips . He 's selling reservations for next holiday . A pound fo one night ; three pounds for four .
PK: You register ?
MORRIE: For both of us . Took the whole holiday .
PK: No .
MORRIE: Christ ! I 'm about to have a calf . This bloody Boer gets lucky , we 're in the poorhouse .
PK: Right .
ANNOUNCER: And at the end of six matches in all weight divisions , the score is Prince of Wales three victories , Helpmakeer three victories . The stands explode with cheers .
REFEREE: You both know the rules . No utts , no elbows , no low blows . First man to score three knock downs wins . Let 's have a good clean fight . Good luck to you .
PK: First row , third from the left . Find out who she is . Morrie looks down at Maria .
MORRIE: We 're in a bloody war here , in
JANNIE: Blery Rooinek . I 'll kill you .
MORRIE: Get up ! Get up !
REFEREE: Okay . Fight .
MORRIE: What are you trying to do , ankrupt us ? What happened ?
PK: I do n't know .
MORRIE: Well , worry about it later . In case you have n't noticed , this Boer bastard is trying to kill you .
PK: You see the way he drops his left when he throws the right ?
MORRIE: Yeah ?
PK: You 're the treasurer of this company . You hold it . Did you find out what I asked for ?
PK: Thanks for the advice . The information please .
MORRIE: Do you know who her father is ? Professor Daniel Marais .
PK: So ?
MORRIE: So ? He 's the Nationalist Party 's esident intellectual . The man is one of the architects of this damned system of what are they calling it ? apartheid ? He has about as much use for a Rooinek Englishman rutting after his daughter as the Queen does fo alls , pardon my French .
PK: What 's her name and where do I find her ? Morrie sighs .
MORRIE: Maria Elizabete Marais , Seniors Cottage , Room 22 , Devilliers School . They do n't call it 'Fortress Virgin ' for nothing . You 'll never get in . PK slips his school blazer on .
PK: You going to take book on that ?
MORRIE: Already have . Three-to-one says you do n't .
PK: Where 'd you bet ?
MORRIE: I took a big position you do .
GIRL: Those are always cold . Use this one .
PK: May I come in ?
MARIA: You ca n't be here . She speaks in Afrikaan-accented English .
PK: I did n't know how else to meet you .
MARIA: I could be expelled .
MARIA: We went on a dare . Please . PK ignores her anxiety .
PK: Did you like it ?
MARIA: It was exciting . You were very good .
PK: Thank you . I 'm glad I impressed you .
MARIA: You speak the Taal .
PK: I 'll speak Zulu if it 'll help me see you again .
MARIA: I ca n't .
PK: Why not ?
MARIA: I need my father 's permission .
PK: Is it hard to get ?
MARIA: Hard for an Afrikaaner boy . Impossible for an English one .
PK: How about your permission ? Do I have that ? Maria blushes .
GIRL #1: We 're having coffee upstairs . Want to come ?
MARIA: I have to finish this paper .
GIRL #2: Come when you 're finished . We 'll e up late .
MARIA: Please go .
PK: You did n't answer my question .
MARIA: There are plenty of English girls . What makes me so important ?
PK: The way I felt when I saw you .
MARIA: My father will insist on meeting you .
PK: I ca n't wait .
MARIA: Now please . PK opens her window and starts to climb out .
PK: Good night , Maria Marais .
MARIA: Good night , PK .
PK: I do n't remember telling you my name .
MARIA: And I do n't remember telling you mine .
MARAIS: Jan Piet Marais . My uncle . At 22 he led a kommando for three years before your people caught him and hung him .
PK: My people ?
MARAIS: The English .
PK: I consider myself an African , sir .
MARAIS: As do I . As do the Zulu , the Xhosa , the Pongo , the Ndebele . We 're all Africans . But all from separate tribes , ay ?
PK: Unfortunately .
MARAIS: Why do you say that ?
PK: Because it 's the whole tribal idea that creates our problems here in South Africa .
MARAIS: The problems of South Africa , my oy , do not come from tribalism . They come from counter-tribalism . From people insisting that natural laws which have been in place and operating since God 's creation , should be tampered with . Does the gazelle sleep with the lion ? Does the rhino graze with the mouse ? The separation of things is not coincidental . Do you think a Zulu wants to see his culture , his sense of identity , replaced by someone else 's anymore than I do ?
PK: No , sir . But I do n't think he wants being a Zulu to mean he is denied the same rights as everyone else has .
MARAIS: Which is why civilization is defined by the ability to live under the rule of law . Laws define rights .
PK: But do they define justice ?
MARAIS: Ah . Justice . The banner behind which the English marched as they gobbled up a quarter of the world ? Justice , my boy , is only relative to who 's in charge .
PK: And how long they stay in charge is only relative to how well they dispense that justice with all due respect .
MARIA: Papa , would you like coffee in the library or the parlor ?
MARAIS: The library , mein leib .
PK: Why is that , sir ?
MARAIS: You come here to ask for permission to see my daughter . Correct ?
PK: Yes , sir .
MARAIS: And knowing who I am , what I stand for , do you think this sort of discussion is going to put that equest in a favorable light ?
PK: I thought a man of your intellectual eputation would n't want his daughter seeing someone who did n't think .
MARAIS: Let me give you some advice then . You 're right . I admire a keen mind . But intellectual reputation or not , I am first a Marais , a member of the Volk .
PK: These ideas I picked up somewhere else . Marais opens the library door .
MARAIS: No doubt from an expert on race elations .
PK: Actually , sir , from an expert on cactus .
DOC: This I do not normally without permission do , ja ? But to catch the expression . After all , it is the expression that is important . Ja ? Without the expression the human being is just a lump of meat . You have some problems , I think . I am Professor Karl von Vollensteen .
PK: I 'm P.K . He holds out his hand . Doc takes it .
DOC: Such a young person with such an
PK: But I do n't want to be known as a brain .
DOC: Why not ?
PK: Who do you think gets beaten up on all the time in school ?
DOC: My boy , to be smart is not a sin . But to be smart and not use it , that is sin number one . And as for getting beat up on , use your brain to figure out how not to be .
MORRIE: Look , even if the scholarship does n't come through , my old man said he 'd lend you the money .
PK: Morrie .
MORRIE: All right . All right . We 'll call it the 'Levy Carpet Emporium Scholarship for Poor but Proud Christian Gentlemen . ' How 's that ?
PK: Tell your father I appreciate the offer .
MORRIE: God , I hate people who ca n't be ought .
PK: Why is that ?
MORRIE: I do n't know . Personality disorder . PK nods in agreement .
PK: Undoubtedly .
MORRIE: How do they get away with this ?
PK: There he is .
MORRIE: Christ , he 's old .
PK: And he 's the best . C'mon .
SOLLY: What ? You boys lost ?
PK: I 'm the one who called you yesterday . From the Prince of Wales School ?
SOLLY: Oh yeah , yeah . The champeen . Right ?
PK: Right .
SOLLY: And who are you ?
MORRIE: The champeen 's manager . Solly rolls his eyes to heaven .
SOLLY: Oy gevalt . You know you train here it 's not like those nice school fights you 're used to . Three knockdowns you win .
MORRIE: What does it cost for you to train him ?
SOLLY: For my personal attentinons , Mr . Manager ? Fifty pounds a month . For one of them less .
MORRIE: Here 's for six months in advance . Three hundred pounds . Solly pushes the money back .
SOLLY: Six months ? I do n't know you oy 'll last six minutes .
PK: I 'll last .
PK: Yes , sir .
SOLLY: Go change in the back . We 'll see if you could n't find a better use for all that money .
PK: Thank you , sir .
SOLLY: Why 's he want to do this , a nice- looking schoolboy ?
MORRIE: He wants to be welterweight champ of the world . Solly breaks up laughing .
SOLLY: Oh sure , sure . And I 'd like to e twenty-five again .
MORRIE: You like to make book on it ?
SOLLY: You giving odds ?
MORRIE: You name them . Solly gives him a long look .
SOLLY: You both meshugah . Solly walks away .
PK: In prison , sir .
SOLLY: You trying to be a comedian and a oxer ? Mr . Manager , come to my office . We 'll talk terms . You , get showered , and see me after . We 'll talk training .
PK: Yes , sir .
VON ZYL: I am Kommandant Von Zyl . The professor has requested you to be his visitor so you can continue your studies on piano and he can continue with his studies on cactus . This is the first specimen ? He alludes to the bucket .
PK: Yes , sir . Kalanchoe Thrysiflora . He holds the bucket up .
VON ZYL: The professor taught you this , ja ? Of course to your English town he is a prisoner , a criminal . To us who respect such learning and culture , he is an honored guest .
PK: Yes , sir .
VON ZYL: Come . I will take you myself .
PK: Yes , sir .
VON ZYL: You like to box ?
PK: I would like to learn , meneer . Are the boys prisoners ?
VON ZYL: No , no . The sons of the guards . See that one there ? ( points to a
SMIT: Sir ?
VON ZYL: We have room for one more on the squad ? Smit looks down at PK .
SMIT: He 's a little small , Kommandant .
VON ZYL: We 'll build him up then .
SMIT: Yes , sir . But I really do n't have anyone to spare to teach him ight now . You know , with the tournament coming up .
VON ZYL: There must be someone . Smit looks around the hall .
SMIT: Piet .
GEEL PIET: I teach him best I know , baas .
SMIT: We train every day . First thing in the morning . Miss two trainings , you 're gone .
PK: Yes , meneer .
SMIT: Come tomorrow . See this old kaffir .
PK: Yes , meneer . Thank you , meneer .
VON ZYL: Lieutenant , a word ? The two men step off to the side .
GEEL PIET: Do n't worry , little baas . Little can beat big any day . First with the head , then with the heart . Little defeat big when little is smart . You can remember that ?
PK: Yes , sir .
GEEL PIET: No , no . Do n't never call me sir . 'Specially in front of the guards .
PK: What should I call you ?
GEEL PIET: Piet . Geel Piet .
COACH: Kaffir . Towels .
GEEL PIET: Okay , baas . Coming , baas .
MARIA: You took a big chance talking to my father the way you did .
PK: Not really . Going in I was behind on points with him . I 'm English . I attend a politically suspect school . I 'm a boxer .
MARIA: He likes boxers .
PK: All men like boxers . But not fo their daughters . So I had to find some way to make an impression . They get on line for the Ferris wheel .
MARIA: You could have picked a more agreeable topic .
PK: And made much less of an impression . Talk to someone about their passion . Even if they disagree they 'll remember you . It was really the most logical strategy if you think about it .
MARIA: Do you spend hours thinking about how to deal with me , too ?
PK: Days .
MARIA: Know what I think ?
PK: No .
MARIA: Want to try ?
PK: Sure .
MARIA: I see a forest . It goes on forever . There are giant trees which keep getting bigger and igger over thousands of years . Now you .
PK: I see little trees growing on the forest floor , learning to grow with the little bit of light the ig trees let in . Now you .
MARIA: I see the big trees getting bigger , their leaves and branches making one great green umbrella over all of Africa . The wheel stops again at its highest point .
MARIA: You tell a very good story .
GEEL PIET: You wear out this old man . See ? See how it can work ? How little eat big ?
PK: Yes , sir . But when do I get to punch ?
GEEL PIET: You not going to just punch , man . You going to combination . He demonstrates .
DOC: How is the next Joe Louis this morning ?
PK: Try and hit me . Doc chuckles .
DOC: You are amazing .
PK: And I 'm going to learn the Geel Piet eight .
DOC: Yes , yes , yes . But right now you have to come learn the Beethoven Fifth for one hour so we can get to the cactus before it 's too hot to plant . Did you ing her ? PK points to a nearby bucket .
PK: Parchypodium Namquanium .
DOC: Excellent . Excellent . We make from you a champion and a brain .
GEEL PIET: Excuse me , big baas . But can I talk to the small baas ?
DOC: Of course .
GEEL PIET: Every day I see you bring the ucket and in the bottom is some tobacco leaf .
PK: It keeps the roots wet .
GEEL PIET: What happens to the leaf after ?
DOC: A little I use in some water to make a bug spray for the plants .
PK: And the rest we throw away .
GEEL PIET: If you leave the pail when you go plant is a problem , small baas ?
PK: I do n't understand .
GEEL PIET: Is like this . You see how hard the life is for the people here in prison . Only little pleasure they take from this hard life maybe sometimes when no one watching late at night a little smoke . Now with the big war in Europe tobacco is plenty hard to get outside . Inside it is gone . We are the forgotten in here .
PK: We have bunches of leaves at home . I 'll bring a whole bucketful tomorrow .
GEEL PIET: No , no . Must n't do that , little aas .
PK: I do n't understand .
DOC: What Geel Piet means is it can be dangerous . Something the guards might not want the people to have .
PK: What 's wrong with tobacco ? Why would n't they want them to have it ?
DOC: What 's wrong is people whose jo it is to punish . After a little while it is all they know how to do .
PK: What should I do ?
DOC: This is for you to answer .
BORMANN: I smell something not right here , ay , kaffir ? He pokes Geel Piet with his truncheon .
GEEL PIET: No , meneer sergeant . Everything okay here .
BORMANN: I do n't fuckin ' believe you . He glares at Doc and PK .
DOC: Schweinhund .
GEEL PIET: No , no . This old kaffir 's okay . Sorry to make any trouble , little aas . We just stick to the boxing now on . Sorry , sorry .
PK: Geel Piet . Geel Piet turns .
DOC: PK , to me you are the champion of the world already . Come . Let us go box now with Mr. Beethoven . PK and Doc exit .
SOLLY: Now at the end of the Geel Piet eight you do this one-two One-two-three the Solly Goldman thirteen . Okay ?
MORRIE: How do you get away with this , Mr. G ? Why do n't they close you down ? I mean , there are laws about lacks and white boxing each other .
SOLLY: In a public match . Not in a gym . Not yet anyway . The Boer is a funny people . Outside the ring the black is not equal . Inside he is . But only in private , not in public . So I keep my mouth shut , the police go a little blind , and that 's that . It 's a crazy world , huh ?
MORRIE: Six , seven , eight , nine , ten . That 's it .
ASSISTANT: Solly wants to see you two .
MORRIE: You wanted to see us , Mr. G. ?
SOLLY: Close the door . Someone I got a lot of respect for asked me to make a request . He wants to put you in a match .
MORRIE: With who ?
SOLLY: A young guy just turned pro . Gideon Mandoma .
MORRIE: A black fighter ! They want him to fight a black fighter ?
SOLLY: In a black township . Sofiatown .
MORRIE: Out of the question . Not even up for discussion . C'mon , P.K .
PK: Who asked you to ask ?
SOLLY: The man who promotes all the fights in Sofiatown Elias Nguni .
PK: And you trust him ?
SOLLY: In thirty years I know him , number one on the list .
MORRIE: You 're both out of your minds .
PK: Did he tell you why he wants the match ?
SOLLY: I told you what he told me .
PK: Just talking boxing how do I match up with Mandoma ?
SOLLY: Pretty even .
MORRIE: I mean besides getting thrown out of school and into jail , do you know what else happens you do this ? He 's a pro . The minute you fight him you 're a pro .
SOLLY: There 's no purse being offered .
MORRIE: That 's a good career move . Risk everything to gain nothing . Very sound business sense .
PK: Tell Mr. Nguni I 'll think about it .
MORRIE: Okay . What 's going on ?
PK: I do n't know .
MORRIE: Well why do n't you tell me what you do know .
PK: There 's an African myth about an outsider who comes one day and unites all the tribes into one against their oppressors . They call it the myth of Onoshobishobi Ingelosi the tadpole angel . That chanting at the school championships ?
MORRIE: For you ?
PK: I have n't heard it in years . PK begins to disrobe .
MORRIE: And how did this honor fall on your broad back ?
PK: I told you about bringing tobacco to the prisoners at Barberton ? Well after that was going for a while I learned that even though they could send and receive letters , they never did . They could n't read or write .
MORRIE: So you did it for them .
PK: Right .
MORRIE: And after that ?
PK: A clothing program for thei families and a food program . One thing sort of led to another .
MORRIE: I can see where 'angel ' would be an appropriate title . But it was , uh , this Geel Piet who was really behind all of it , was n't it ?
PK: He was very good at pointing things out .
MORRIE: Man like that should be running a country , not rotting in prison .
PK: He 's not in prison anymore . He 's dead .
MARIA: I thought I 'd surprise you .
PK: Well , you succeeded .
MARIA: Mr. Goldman was explaining the theory behind the left hook .
MORRIE: Beats talking about the weather . You may have heard about me ?
MARIA: Oh yes . How d'you do . Solly 's Assistant whistles for him .
SOLLY: Well , nice meeting you , Maria .
MARIA: Nice meeting you , Mr. Goldman .
SOLLY: We never had a girl come to the gym . It 's not such a bad thing , huh ? Solly moves off .
PK: You got a pass to come out on a weeknight ?
MARIA: Your tree pass .
MORRIE: Do I look that daft ?
PK: Morrie 's the brains of the operation .
MORRIE: He means the bank . Your boyfriend has a great head for literature ut none for finance . They exit the staircase .
PK: I see you , Nguni .
NGUNI: I see you , P.K . They talk across the narrow street .
PK: Yes . Why do you make it ?
NGUNI: A woman has thrown the sacred ox ones . She has made a fire and ead the smoke .
PK: What did she read ?
NGUNI: That the Onoshobishobi Ingelosi who is a chief must fight the one who one day will be a chief .
PK: But it 's not true that I 'm a chief .
NGUNI: Who knows what is true and what is not . The legend of Onoshobishobi Ingelosi is very powerful among the people . They see you box the Boer and always you win . They have heard the stories from Barberton . The people live with little hope . They must see if the spirit of the boy still lives in the man .
PK: And if I lose ? If the spirit of the Onoshobishobi Ingelosi does not exist in me anymore , then what will they live with ?
NGUNI: Less hope . But still they must
POLICE #1: What 's this here ?
PK: An old family servant , Officer . From home . We just ran into each other .
POLICE #2: Papers , man . Come on , be quick . Nguni reaches into his pocket .
POLICE #1: Where you coming from ?
PK: Gym , sir . I train there .
POLICE #1: And you ?
MORRIE: I 'm his manager .
POLICE #2: And you 're the sparring partner , hey ?
NGUNI: Yes , baas . Going right now .
MARIA: I 'm scared for you , PK .
PK: Solly 's a great teacher . He would n't put me in a fight I could n't handle .
MARIE: I mean about how involved you are with the black people . That scares me .
PK: Because you do n't understand them .
MARIA: No I do n't .
PK: If you did you would n't be so scared . You ever have a conversation with a black person ?
MARIA: Of course .
PK: Besides a servant . Maria 's silence is her answer .
MARIA: I hate it when you tease me .
PK: Sorry . He kisses her .
MARIA: No you 're not .
PK: Yes I am .
MARIA: I better go .
LEWIS: According to your submission you have ambitions to be a writer and the welterweight boxing champion of the world .
PK: Yes , sir .
LEWIS: Do n't you find seeking a career as a pugilist and reading for a degree at Oxford a bit , how shall we put it , intellectually
PK: Lord Byron was a boxer , sir . And I 've never heard anyone question his intellectual integrity .
LEWIS: I do not recall Lord Byron actually engaging in matches fo money .
PK: Actually , sir , there are several ecorded instances of Lord Byron engaging in matches for quite large sums of money .
EXAMINER #2: Quite right . Yes . In a letter to his wife Shelley makes mention of just such a thing . For hundreds of pounds , actually . Lewis has heard enough .
LEWIS: Let 's move along , shall we ? As your presentational you 've equested to read from a work of your own fiction .
PK: Yes , sir .
LEWIS: Well , then , let us hope we 'll be treated to the stirrings of another Byron .
PK: The Concerto for the Southland and the Death of Geel Piet . His name was Geel Piet yellow Peter . He was a mix of half the lood in Africa Dutch , Portuguese , Zulu , Sotha , and who knew what else . His fathe
GEEL PIET: To them you are . You are the one who brings the smoke , the one who writes the letters , the one who puts clothes on their children when they are cold . You are Onoshobishobi Ingelosi .
PK: But you know that 's not true .
GEEL PIET: Who is to say what is true and what is not true , kleine baas .
DOC: The Allied armies have crossed the Rhine into Germany . It is almost over .
PK: That 's great , is n't it ? He turns to Geel Piet .
DOC: You are a good faker , Geel Piet . ut you do n't think it 's great at all . It means you lose your sta letter writer and tobacco importer .
GEEL PIET: No matter that , Professor . We always manage here . What pains me most is I lose my boxer .
PK: I 'll come back .
GEEL PIET: No , kleine baas . You leave this damn place you do n't come back never .
DOC: Geel Piet , when a painter finishes a work of art he does n't lose it . He sends it out in the world so everyone can see the genius of his creation . This is what you are going to do . And to celebrate the launch of such a work of art as you have made our boxer here , I have composed an entire concerto 'The Concerto for the Southland ' which it is my intention to play in concert for the prisoners efore I leave .
GEEL PIET: Not possible . The kommandant never allow the people to have such a thing .
DOC: He 'll think it 's a concert for him and the brass . But we 'll know , ay ? And the people will know .
PK: He 'll never let black be with white here , Doc .
DOC: If the black is part of the
GEEL PIET: But the people have no instruments in this place , big baas .
DOC: They have their voices . Each tribe a different voice , a different language all singing together . It is brilliant , no ?
PK: Except the tribes do n't trust each other . They do n't even talk to each other .
DOC: Oh . This is correct . This stupid hatred .
GEEL PIET: They will do it for you , kleine aas . You are Onoshobishobi Ingelosi . You bring the tobacco . You write the letters . You put clothes on their children 's bodies and food in their bellies . All you do is ask and they all sing for you .
DOC: He 's right . Wunderbar . You are the smartest of us all .
BORMANN: A kaffir smarter than all of us ? You are a strange German , Professor .
DOC: That little maniac with the moustache in Berlin you admire . He is the strange German . And soon kaput , I hope .
BORMANN: If that 's true you 'll not be long for this place , eh , Professor ?
DOC: No , Sergeant . God willing .
BORMANN: And you , too , little Rooinek . But you , kaffir , Hitler comes o goes He takes Geel Piet 's hand .
DOC: Have you seen my page turner ?
PK: No . He asks a prisoner in Zulu .
DOC: He will come .
VON ZYL: Where is Bormann ? I need Bormann to translate to the prisoners .
SMIT: I do n't know , Kommandant .
DOC: Is there a problem here , Kommandant ?
VON ZYL: I want to address these filthy kaffirs but I do n't have a translator .
PK: I 'll translate .
VON ZYL: You can speak Zulu , PK ?
PK: Yes , sir .
VON ZYL: All right . Listen up . He addresses the prisoners .
PK: The Kommandant welcomes you and looks forward to the great singing .
VON ZYL: For such a man I am happy to do this . But one hair of trouble and it 's finish .
PK: He hopes each tribe will sing its est and bring honor to its people .
VON ZYL: One wrong move and you get marched ack to your cells and do n't come out for a month .
PK: He says tonight let us be one people under the African sky .
VON ZYL: You did a good job .
PK: Thank you , sir .
VON ZYL: Professor ?
PK: No !
LEWIS: Thank you very much . You will be notified as to the University 's decision by mail . PK rises and goes to exit .
PK: Yes , sir .
LEWIS: This Bormann , he was real ?
PK: Yes , sir .
LEWIS: Was justice ever served ?
PK: Yes , sir . Sergeant Bormann died of cancer of the rectum . PK turns and exits .
SOLLY: The night wo n't last forever , oychick .
PK: It 'll only take a minute . Solly puts the car in gear and drives off .
SOLLY: The night I escaped from the Tsar 's Army it was just like this . Six of us four Jews , two Ukranians . Dark as anything . No streets . In the day we hid in ushes . At night we went .
MORRIE: You deserted ?
SOLLY: Whey they come take you at thirteen years old and tell you it 's twenty-five years in the Army , it 's your duty to desert .
NGUNI: Yes , yes . Sorry . I drive .
MARIA: Thank you .
VOICES: Onoshobishobi Ingelosi .
NGUNI: The people have come from everywhere to see you .
MORRIE: Where are the men ?
NGUNI: They are to be witness .
MORRIE: I do n't see why we have to weigh in . They 're going to fight anyway .
NGUNI: It is very important the people see everything is correct .
PK: I see you , Gideon Mandoma .
MANDOMA: I see you , PK .
PK: I just want you to know you fight a man . Onoshobishobi Ingelosi is just a name I was given at Barberton Prison . It means nothing .
MANDOMA: It is not for you or me to say what it means .
NGUNI: Please .
WHISPERS: Onoshobishobi .
CROWD: Onoshobishopi Ingelosi . Shobi shobi Ingelosi .
OLD WOMAN: Onoshobishobi Ingelosi .
REFEREE: You are listening to me please . When I am shouting break , you must eak at once . When a knockdown is coming , it is for an eight count . No heads , no elbows . You fight clean or by golly I am giving you penalty points . Good luck , boys .
PK: What do you see ?
SOLLY: A very tough fight . The BELL RINGS .
REFEREE: Continue .
PK: God , he hits like a truck .
SOLLY: He 's going for the quick knockout . He ca n't keep it up . Soon the truck runs out of gas .
PK: If he catches me again like that I 'll run out of gas permanently .
SOLLY: He 's had it . He 's got no strength in his punch .
PK: Could 've fooled me .
SOLLY: I 'm telling you .
MORRIE: Look he 's taking water . They all look .
SOLLY: See . Where that water goes you go . Right to here . He pokes PK 's belly .
REFEREE: Three four five

MARIA: The Seniors Dance is two Saturdays from now . I would like it if you could escort me .
PK: Maria Marais with a rooinek at the Senior Dance ? What will people think ?
MARIA: They 'll think what they think and I 'll think what I think .

MARIA: I think I love you .
PK: I would be honored to be you escort . Maria beams .
MARIA: I did n't doubt it for a minute . Solly HONKS the HORN . PK kisses Maria once more .
PK: I 'll give you a boost .
MARIA: Thank you for tonight . You were great .
SOLLY: When you and your manager first came to me with that meshuganah idea to be welterweight champion of the world you did not have a ig believer here . But I got ta tell you . Now you do . In London lives Benny Rosen , the greatest trainer in the world today . When you go to your Oxford I give you a letter to Rosen . Whatever I ca n't do for you , he can .
PK: Thanks , Mr. G. Solly pokes Morrie awake .
SOLLY: And I give the address of a very good bookmaker . Teach you also a thing or two . Now , go on back to being fancy-schmancy English gentlemen . I 'm proud of both of you .
MORRIE: You 're up early , sir .
ST. JOHN: Best time for walking .
PK: Best time for running too , sir .
MORRIE: Have to put in the roadwork , sir . You know , keep those legs strong . St. John eyes the bruise on PK 's cheek .
ST. JOHN: Yes . Quite a fresh bruise there .
PK: I tripped .
ST. JOHN: Maybe you should change you footwear .
BOTH: Yes , sir .
MANDOMA: Please excuse me for coming like a thief by the window .
PK: You speak English ? PK is surprised . Mandoma nods .
MANDOMA: Second greatest in this room .
PK: But you did n't come to talk about fighting .
MANDOMA: When you say to me , Onoshobishobi Ingelosi means nothing , you are ight . And you are wrong . The legend gives the people hope fo a good tomorrow . But hope alone will not make a good tomorrow for the people . You can not write our letters , get us clothes , food , work . These things we must do ourselves , so we can be part of this country 's good tomorrow . If we are not , the hope will disappear . The people will grow tired . The tired will grow angry and there will be no good tomorrow for anybody black or white .
PK: What are you asking from me ?
MANDOMA: To be part of something you must know what everyone else knows . We have our own knowledge . We need yours .
MORRIE: We get our knowledge in schools , Gideon . We 're not born with it .
MANDOMA: Then it must be the same with us .
MORRIE: You have schools .
MANDOMA: Yes . And teachers who can not do more than their own ABC 's . We have a system made not to teach us .
PK: I am only seventeen years old , Gideon . I can not teach five million people how to speak English and do sums .
MANDOMA: You taught the singing to thousands at Barberton Prison . You were only twelve . Mandoma rises .
PK: Second greatest in this room , Gideon . Mandoma exits through the window .
ST. JOHN: You are asking me for a lot , young man .
PK: I 'm only asking you to put what you 've taught us into practice , sir .
ST. JOHN: You are asking me to put the eputation of this school in jeopardy .
PK: The reputation of this school , sir , is based on its integrity .
ST. JOHN: I 'm aware of that . I 'm also aware of what will happen if this eve gets out . We live in a country where the rules are being ewritten .
PK: Then we 'd better be careful to keep a firm hand on our pens sir . St. John regards PK .
ST. JOHN: All right . I will allow it on a trial basis . Here are my conditions you tell no one ; you operate at night on Saturdays when the student body is gone ; you involve no one besides yourself and Mr. Levy . If you can comply , you can have your school .
MARIA: Ready . Set . Go !
PK: You okay ?
MARIA: You 're supposed to let me win .
PK: Then you 'd say I was being condescending .
MARIA: You were guilty of that when you gave me a head start .
PK: Uh no .
MARIA: The dance is only a week away .
PK: Maria I ca n't come to the dance .
MARIA: Why not ?
PK: I have an obligation .
MARIA: Ca n't you change it ?
PK: It 's a permanent obligation . Every Saturday night It starts tonight . Maria can not believe what she is hearing .
MARIA: You 're breaking up with me .
PK: No .
MARIA: Then what could be so important that it takes all your Saturday nights ?
PK: I really ca n't say .
PK: I 'm not going away .
MARIA: Yes you are . I can feel it .
PK: I 'm not . I 'm just tutoring . Maria pulls back .
MARIA: I 'm losing you to a bunch of kaffirs ?
PK: You 're not losing anything .
MARIA: No ? Are you escorting me to the dance ? Are you going to see me on the only free night they give us ?
PK: Maria , this is important to me .
MARIA: And my life 's important to me . Damn you .
DOC: Ach . You see how beautiful ?
PK: You ever hear of glycerine , Doc ?
DOC: Mr. Going-To-Oxford-Smarty-Pants . Of course I know about glycerine . Triglycerine . Biglycerine . Monoglycerine . What do you want to know ?
PK: Why you do n't use it . It 's only a little pill under the tongue .
DOC: Tongues were not made to put little pills under . When I have to start with that , I become something else .
PK: Well , until you become something else , the little pills would make this easier on your heart .
DOC: Little pills or no little pills we do n't find cover , we both turn into something else .
PK: I 've found something .
DOC: Exploring .
PK: Why do n't you just rest ?
DOC: Plenty time for resting when I am something else . Look .
PK: Let 's hope it 's not hungry .
DOC: Better , ja ?
PK: What 's that smell ?
DOC: Who can think about rain when you are on the edge of the great unknown cave .
PK: You do n't know that .
DOC: The bats did n't come from a shoebox , Mr. Know-It-All . Doc heads off .
PK: It was your idea . Your ' e the one who pushed for me to go .
DOC: Ja . But who knew they do such a good job of boxing up part of
PK: Which part is that ?
DOC: The one where is all the questions . The curiosity center . Look .
PK: Incredible .
DOC: This is incredible ! The crystal . You can feel the life go right through you . Here . Doc rises .
PK: No . That 's all right . Can we go ?
DOC: We have only just gotten here . What 's the matter , P.K . ?
PK: All day long you 've been talking about becoming something else , about dying . You never talked about dying before .
DOC: I 'm 87 next month . It 's natural .
PK: Not to a sixteen-year-old it 's not . It 's painful . Doc realizes what PK is saying .
DOC: You are right . I am sorry . Sixteen-year-old ears should only hear life .
PK: I 'll just set you up with some coffee here , so in the morning you wo n't have to bother making it . He begins to prepare the coffee .
DOC: P.K . ?
PK: I 'm here , Doc .
DOC: The crystal cave will be ou secret , ja ?
PK: Whatever you say .
DOC: Promise .
PK: I promise .
DOC: Ja . Good . I rest a little . The heart of Africa , P.K . Doc lays down .
MORRIE: Christ ! If someone would have told me this is where I 'd be on a Saturday night , last term of my senior year , I 'd call them atty . You know , you 're going to owe me for the rest of your life on this one .
PK: That all ? I figured you 'd hold me to it longer .
MORRIE: You get the insider friend 's ate .
PK: Thanks , mate .
MANDOMA: I see you , P.K .
PK: I see you , Gideon .
MORRIE: Let 's get inside before the whole loody world sees us .
MANDOMA: Morrie .
PK: Let 's go . Stay to the fence . The group moves out .
ALL: ' A . '
PK: Excuse me .
MARIA: I thought you might need some help . Or I can just sit and watch . PK hands her the chalk .
PK: Class . This is Maria . She is now the teacher . We 're doing alphabet , from the letter ' A . '
MARIA: ' A . '
PK: Repeat what she says . Say it again .
MARIA: ' A . '

MANDOMA: And you are one lucky English . He kids PK . PK blushes .
PK: Good night , Gideon .
MORRIE: Well , I think I 'll go um lay on my back and count the cracks in the ceiling . 'Night . Nice to see you , Maria .
MARIA: Good night , Morrie . Morrie runs off . PK takes Maria around .
PK: I am one lucky English . They embrace and kiss .
MARIA: P.K . Can I ask you a favor ?
PK: Anything .
MARIA: We do n't have to go in or anything . You can hear the music from outside . I 'd love to have one dance with you before I graduate .
PK: Done .
MARIA: I feel so good . Race you to the gate .
PK: You need a headstart ?
MARIA: No . She takes off . PK follows .
MORRIE: We made it ! We made it ! He thrusts one of the letters at PK .
PK: You 're out of here .
MORRIE: What the hell are you talking about ? He snatches PK 's letter .
PK: It says nothing about the scholarship .
MORRIE: A technicality . Another BOY comes over .
BOY: St. John wants to see you two in his study .
MORRIE: Good news travels fast .
PK: I 'll get showered and changed .
BOY: He said to come as you are . Immediately .
PK: Wanted to see us , sir ?
ST. JOHN: Yes . Come in . Close the door .
PK: Why ?
BRETYN: Because it is illegal .
MORRIE: We 're only teaching them how to ead and do sums .
BRETYN: You do n't have certification to do that .
PK: Prince of Wales is a certified school .
BRETYN: Yes . But not certified for that
PK: Can he do this , sir ?
BRETYN: Of course I can do it . Would I e here if I could n't ? Come now meneer headmaster . Let 's end this now . I have a full day ahead of me still .
ST. JOHN: The Saturday school is to be disbanded until further notice .
BRETYN: Thank you , meneer headmaster . Your cooperation in this matte is very appreciated . Good day . Bretyn goes to exit .
PK: You know it ca n't go on like this forever . St. John tenses .
BRETYN: What ca n't ?
PK: What you 're doing .
BRETYN: I 'm just doing my job . And if you 'll take some advice , you should just do yours . Bretyn exits .
MORRIE: Is that really the end of it , sir ?
ST. JOHN: For the moment I 'm afraid it is .
PK: If we let them get away with it on our own grounds , it will neve
ST. JOHN: History disputes you .
PK: History takes too long .
ST. JOHN: Yes it does . But it is neve kind to those who try to hurry it .
PK: I feel we should resist , sir .
ST. JOHN: So do I , P.K . But this is not a subtle government . They mean to have their way and damn the consequences . And I can not jeopardize this school , no matte how I personally feel . I 'm sorry . I heard you were accepted at Oxford .
MORRIE: Yes , sir . Received notification today .
ST. JOHN: Well , congratulations .
MORRIE: Thank you , sir . St. John looks at PK who remains silent .
ST. JOHN: To both of you .
PK: Thank you , sir . An uncomfortable silence lingers .
ST. JOHN: We 'll talk before you go .
PK: Yes , sir . Will that be all ?
ST. JOHN: That 'll be all .
PK: I 'd like to see Maria Marais please . The Guard checks his list .
GUARD: Sorry . She 's not allowed visitors .
PK: Well , if I could just talk to her .
GUARD: Sorry .
PK: Morrie . Morrie .
MORRIE: What ?
PK: I want to show you something .
MORRIE: What time is it ? He looks at his watch and turns over .
PK: No . Come on .
MORRIE: You know , when we get to Oxford separate rooms .
PK: Will you hurry .
MORRIE: Is there some girl out there waiting for me ?
PK: Yeah . Stunning . Breasts like casabas . Just waiting for you .
MORRIE: Bullshit .
PK: What do you think ?
MORRIE: I think you 're fooling yourself into thinking the bastards wo n't
PK: This is a church . Did n't you ever hear of the Christian concept of sanctuary ?
MORRIE: Yes . But I 'm not the one who has to respect it .
PK: Even the Boer has limits , Morrie .
MORRIE: I 'm sure he does , but I 'd still like to see a big bolt on the inside door .
CARETAKER: Mr. Levy ?
SOLLY: Now move it nice and easy , the oth of you . Time .
PK: They want us to close the school . PK counters .
MANDOMA: I know . Mandoma lays in a combination .
PK: We are still game . PK throws a combination .
MANDOMA: So are we .
SOLLY: Would you two find some othe time to chat . This is a boxing ing , not a social club .
PK: I was in the neighborhood .
MARIA: They 're sending me away to school in Pretoria . I told my father I would n't go . He said if I did n't he 'd see they arrest you and ruin your chances . I could n't let him do that .
PK: When do you go ?

PK: Boy .

PK: Girl . I see the girl .
ALL: I see the girl .
MARIA: P.K. , it 's me .
WOMEN: We see the girl . Maria smiles , surprised .
BRETYN: Once warned . Twice punished .
PK: You 're violating the sanctity of the church .
BRETYN: No . You are with your damned ace mixing ideas , rooinek .
PK: At least let the women go .
BRETYN: You want everything to be equal , little Boetie . Why not men and women too ? Just then Morrie throws the bolt .
MORRIE: Now !
BRETYN: Locks keep people out but they also keep them in .
PK: No . Wait . We 'll leave .
BRETYN: Too late . You never should have come . At the ready . The two police lines tense to charge forward . The blacks brace to defend .
PK: No ! Stop !
BRETYN: Now .
MARIA: PK !
PK: Maria !
MEN: Daniel . No . Marais glares at PK .
PK: In case the scholarship does n't come through .
MORRIE: Why are you so bloody stubborn ? You do n't belong in a South African university any more than I belong in the priesthood . Will you take my father 's loan ?
BOY: There a Mr. P.K . here ?
MORRIE: It 's your scholarship . Morrie grabs the telegram .
BOY: Sign here . Odd name P.K .
MORRIE: What 's your name ?
BOY: Waldo .
MORRIE: You 're not one to talk about names .
PK: Doc 's missing .
VON ZYL: Since his pneumonia last yea I 've had one of the men drop y once a week to see if he needed anything . Of course you know the professor . He never did .
PK: Hello ? Mr. G ? Anyone here ?
SOLLY: A repeat performance of history , my boy . Solly Goldman 's being deported . Of course last time I did n't have the luxury of being able to pack .
PK: For what reason ?
SOLLY: Their reason is that I 'm here illegal . I did n't enter the country with a passport . Like the Czar was issuing passports to Russian Jews in 1910 .
PK: This is because of me , is n't it ?
SOLLY: No , boychick . This is because of them . They are the problem , not you . Do n't ever think different . You look tired . Want a glass tea ?
PK: No , no . I have to get back to school . Solly opens his arms . PK hugs him .
SOLLY: You got your head screwed on ight . Do n't let these meshuganahs screw it on wrong . Now go on . You want to find me , look at Benny Rosen 's gym in East End , London .
PK: Thank you for everything .
SOLLY: We 're not finished yet . PK smiles and exits .
MARAIS: You 're a very good writer . The subject matter is a little inflammatory but the style is interesting .
PK: What are you doing here ?
MARAIS: I came to inform you that you will not be receiving aid from the National Scholarship Fund . Neither will you be admitted to any of the South African universities . Here are you applications back . He hands PK the applications as he rises .
MORRIE: Take the hint . Screw the scholarship . Come on . Let 's leave .
PK: If I leave or if I stay in South Africa it 's because I choose to , not because they choose for me .
MORRIE: Where are you going ?
PK: Save my place at Oxford . PK exits the room . Morrie chases after him .
MORRIE: P.K. , goddammit ! He grabs PK , stopping him .
PK: Save my place . Morrie 's grip releases . PK walks out .
THOMAS: Are you crazy ? To sign on fo a year ?
PK: You said I was the best you eve taught , sir .
THOMAS: And you are , boyo . The absolute est .
PK: You worked grizzly a year .
THOMAS: And let me show you what I have to show for it to this day . He holds up his hand . It shakes noticeably .
PK: Something wrong ?
THOMAS: Nothing .
BARTENDER: One double brandy . One lemon soda . He puts the lemon soda in front of PK .
THOMAS: Come on , then . Thomas lifts his glass .
PK: I do n't like the taste .
THOMAS: Taste ? You do n't drink for the taste .
PK: You know , Rasputin , I had them ight where I wanted them . Another minute they were done for .
ELIJAH: Baas . Baas .
PK: Let 's clean her off and call it a night , hey ?
JOCKO: Ay , man . If you 'd let him win once in a while we could take a little book on it here .
PK: He does n't care if he wins . He just likes to play .
JOCKO: And you ?
PK: I like to win .
JOCKO: Which is why I 'm about visiting you . You 've come on the board , man . There are odds on you making it or not .
PK: How are they ?
JOCKO: Not in your favor , my boy .
PK: Why are you telling me this , Jocko ?
JOCKO: When you come up on the boards , oyo , it 's time to bow out . It 's an omen .
PK: I bow out you ca n't make book .
JOCKO: PK , it 's not a bet I want to collect .
PK: Tell me , Jocko , how high will the odds go on something like this ?
JOCKO: The shorter your time , the highe they go . With you probably ten , twelve , thirteen to one when you 're short a month .
PK: When the odds hit the top put me in against all bets for two hundred quid .
JOCKO: I did not come here to solicit your bet .
PK: I know that . I appreciate it . But if you do n't take it , someone else will .
JOCKO: All right . You 're a bleery fool . And I 'll be prayin ' every night it 's the only bet I ever have to pay off on .
PK: And so will I. Jocko rises to exit .
JOCKO: You should let him win once in a while .
PK: When he wins it wo n't be because I let him .
ELIJAH: No , baas .
PK: I never heard a drill at night .
ELIJAH: Baas .
PK: Not the first bloody thing !
ELIJAH: Bad sign , baas .
PK: Bad drilling 's more like it . Come on . Let 's get it going .
ELIJAH: They say juju . Bad magic is in the mine tonight .
PK: She 's playing with us tonight . Fuse set ? Elijah nods .
ELIJAH: I stay with you , baas .
PK: That 's an order .
RASPUTIN: PK !
MINER #1: He 's dead . No doubt about it .
MINER #2: You give me a fair odds on ten quid ?
MINER #1: Four to one .
MINER #2: Make it a sixer and you got me .
MINER #1: You 're on .
MINER #2: Anyone else ? Six to one he 's dead .
MINER #3: He says someone was up there . Blasted it out on PK from the other side ?
MINER #4: Who 's the driller ?
MINER #3: Botha .
MINER #4: No one drills Botha 's stope but Botha , and he only works days .
PK: Help . Help .
RASPUTIN: PK !
JOCKO: Well , look at ya now , boyo . Up and at 'em in no time . And rich as a fuckin ' lord . He tosses a fat wad of cash on PK 's bed .
PK: What 's this ?
JOCKO: Your ticket to ride . Two hundred quid at fourteen to one .
PK: But I did n't make it . I 'm a month short .
JOCKO: Not according to managment . They cashed you out at twelve months for eleven worked . Last thirty days was bonus . And until someone shows me a calendar reads different , twelve months and a year are one and the same kind of thing . And the bet was for a year . So get yourself mended and get your ass out of here .
PK: There 's someone I have to see first . Jocko grows uncomfortable .
JOCKO: What do you want to go pressin ' it for ? You 're rich , lad . You 're whole . Why do you want to go pressin ' it ?
PK: Because I want to know .
JOCKO: Know what ? That the man has
PK: No worries . The luckier you are , the longer you last . The longe you last , the luckier you are . Rasputin moves a chesspiece and bellows .
RASPUTIN: Checkmate ! Checkmate !
JOCKO: There 's an end to everything , oyo . Even luck . Jocko exits .
PK: Well I guess this is goodbye , my friend . I 'll never forget you . Rasputin speaks urgently in Russian .
RASPUTIN: PK . Botha . Nyet , nyet . Nyet , Botha . PK does not respond .
RASPUTIN: PK . Botha . Nyet . Nyet . PK . PK turns the corner and is gone .
DRILLER: Who you lookin ' for ?
PK: Botha . The driller from stope number five .
DRILLER: He 's at the bar .
PK: Thanks .
DRILLER: I would n't disturb him . There 's a reason he 's there and we 're here .
BARTENDER #1: PK . You 're not going to go in ,
PK: Is Botha the driller in there ?
BARTENDER #2: Ja . Always we give him one hou alone before we open . You do n't know this because you work at night , but it is the rule .
FRITZ: Ja . In one hour it is pffft . He motions a man falling on his face .
PK: Are you Botha ? Botha does not turn around .
BOTHA: Ja .
PK: I 'm PK . I worked your grizzly .
BOTHA: Ja .
PK: Why 'd you try to kill me ?
BOTHA: Because I missed the first time , ooinek .
PK: Jaapie Botha .
BOTHA: You remember , rooinek .
PK: Botha . It was thirteen years ago .
BOTHA: Because of you they expelled me . Because of you my father beat me . Threw me out from the farm . Because of you .
PK: Botha . We 've made a lot of money working together . Let the past be the past .
BOTHA: You ruined the country , all you ooineks . You come and ruin the country . He rushes PK again . Again PK sidesteps .
PK: No , Jaapie Botha . It 's hate uining the country .
BOTHA: Jaah . He swings at PK . PK ducks .
PK: Boer hate .
BOTHA: Our country .
GEEL PIET: First with the head , then with the heart . Little defeat big when little is smart .
PK: Want to see the wages of hate ?
TOM: What 's your name girl ? Precious blushes .

PRECIOUS: I 'm looking for alternative school .
CORNROWS: This is an alternative school .
PRECIOUS: What alternative is ?
CORNROWS: What are you asking me ?
PRECIOUS: Alternative . The lady from my othe school tell me to come here to Hotel Theresa , nineteenth floor , it 's `` alternative '' school .
CORNROWS: Each One Teach One is an alternative school and an alternative school is like a choice , a different way to do something .
PRECIOUS: Oh .
CORNROWS: You need your discharge papers from your old school saying they have formally discharged you or we ca n't allow you in the program .
PRECIOUS: I got kicked out 'cause I was pregnant .
CORNROWS: You still need formal discharge papers or we ca n't let you in . It 's the law .

PRECIOUS: ' I have just finished a session with Claireece Precious Jones , an eighteen-year-old African American female . According to her teachers at Each One Teach One where she attends school she is a pen- , phen-
JERMAINE: 'phenomenal '
PRECIOUS: success . Having made strides so tre-men-tremendous in the past year , she was given the mayor 's award for outstanding achievement . She seems actively enengaged in all aspects of the learning process . However , her TABE test scores are disappointingly low ' Not to Miz Rain ! Not to Miz Rain ! 'She scored 2.8 On her last test . ' So what ! Miz Rain-
JERMAINE: Get a grip and gon ' read the report and do n't get all emotional about what this silly hoe got to say . Anyway , if your shit was n't dope you would n't be standing up here eadin ' -what , what 's her name
PRECIOUS: 'She will need at least an 8.0 Before she can enter G.E.D . Class and begin work toward her high school e-qequivalency . '
JERMAINE: Nice .
PRECIOUS: Thanks . 'Abdul is the client 's second-born child . He 's from all outwhere
JERMAINE: 'outward '
PRECIOUS: 'Appearances , a healthy and welladjusted toddler . Precious attends to his needs a-s-s-i-d-u-o-s-l-y
JERMAINE: 'eagerly '
PRECIOUS: 'seeks any and all information on child rearing . The time and esources it would require for this young woman to get a G.E.D . or into college would be considerable '
PRECIOUS: Finish reading this I know what 's coming .
JERMAINE: 'Although she is in school now , it is not a job readiness program . Nonetheless , Claireece is capable of going to work . In January , he son will be two years old . In keeping with the new initiative on welfare reform , I feel Claireece would benefit from any of the various workfare programs in existence . Despite her obvious intellectual limitations she is quite capable of working as a home attendant . '
PRECIOUS: I do n't want to be no motherfucking home attendant ! I wan na be
JERMAINE: Hush ! 'My rapp-o-r-t with Precious is minimal . Although I am not sure with whom , she evidently has access to counseling services provided by Each One Teach One . She has a history of sexual abuse and is H.I.V . positive . '
PRECIOUS: She say she not put that in my file ! Bitch !
JERMAINE: That 's the bitch 's job , to get the mofuckin ' goods on you ! 'The client seems to view the social services , AFDC , as taking care of her forever . '
PRECIOUS: That file do show one thing -that
PRECIOUS: I 'm getting my G.E.D. , a job , and a place for me and Abdul , then I go to college . I do n't want to 'home attend ' nobody !
JERMAINE: You better put this shit back efore you get in trouble . We talk about it with Ms . Rain in the morning .
MS. RAIN: Time is up . Does anyone want to share ? The only hand up belongs to Precious ' .
PRECIOUS: I do n't really want to read all I wrote , I jus ' wan na kinda say what it is I 'm writing about and how it came about .
AISHA: What happened ?
PRECIOUS: Well , to make a long story short , the counselor at Advancement House quizzing me about Mama and Daddy etc. , etc . But it 's really about workfare . She want to send me out as home attendant .
RHONDA: How you know ?
PRECIOUS: Cause I stole my file from Advancement House and read it . The class GASPS .
JO ANN: Next time get mine 's too .
PRECIOUS: All this 'What you wan na be ? ' And 'You can talk to me . ' They ain ' no motherfucking therapists on ou side , they just flunkies for the 'fare . I wan na work , but not for no motherfucking welfare check in Central Park -displacing brothers and sisters who really got jobs cleaning up 'cause I 'm there working for free .
JERMAINE: And what kinda shit is it fo someone like Precious to have quit school before she get her G.E.D . to work at some live-in job for some old-ass crackers . She 'll never make a rise she get stuck in some shit like that !
MS. RAIN: Sit up straight Jermaine and watch your language . Both of you . Please . Jermaine reluctantly sits up .
PRECIOUS: Miz Rain , If I did n't steal that file I would n't know what I was facing !
MS. RAIN: You read the whole thing by yourself ?
PRECIOUS: Yeahbasically .

JERMAINE: Rhonda used to have to go all the way out to Brighton Beach where she work for them people .
PRECIOUS: The people had her there all day and night - 'on call ' they call it . But you only get pay for 8 hours so that 's 8 X $ 6.37 = $ 50.96 a day , but then you is not eally getting that much cause you is working more than eight hours a day . You is working 24 hours a day and 50.96 divided by 24 is
JO ANN: Rhonda say old bitch would ring a ell - a actual bell -when she want Rhonda in the night !
PRECIOUS: Home attendants usually work six days a week . I would only see Abdul on Sundays ? When would I go to school ? Am I gon na hafta go be home attendant like Rhonda was ?
MS. RAIN: No ! So stop worrying about it . We 'll cross that bridge when we get to it . Trust me -no , trust yourself . My concern now is that if this Ms. Weiss is someone you 're working with and ca n't trust , she 's out ! We got ta find somebody else .
PRECIOUS: Well , I just write in my notebook till I get wif some kinda therapist I can trust . Actually that always help me more than talking to her . Plus , I 'm going to start going to meetings wif Rita for insect survivors .
BUNNY: Incest .
PRECIOUS: That 's what I mean .
BUNNY: Well it ai n't what you been saying .

MS. WEISS: Why congratulations Precious . That 's
MAN: He 's here .
PHILIPS: You 're looking well , Dutch .
SCHAEFER: It 's been a long time , General .
PHILIPS: We 've got a real problem here , something right up your alley .
SCHAEFER: That 's over the border , General .
PHILIPS: That 's the problem . Apparently they strayed off course . We 're certain they 've been captured by the guerrillas .
SCHAEFER: What have you got in mind , General .
PHILIPS: We figure we 've got less than twenty-four hours to catch up with them . After that , there 's not much hope . We want a rescue operation mounted tonight . That does n't give you much time . Another puff on the cigar .
SCHAEFER: What else it new ? When do we leave ? Philips looks at his watch .
PHILIPS: You lift off in three hours . There 's one other thing .
SCHAEFER: What 's that , General ?
PHILIPS: Someone else will be going in with you . Schaefer stubbs out his cigar in an ashtray .
SCHAEFER: You know we do n't work with outsiders , General .
VOICE: Who said anything about outsiders , Dutch ?
DILLON: Last time we danced , it was Lieutenant , Schaefer . A grin breaks out across Schaefer 's face .
SCHAEFER: Dillon , you son of a bitch .
DILLON: How you been , Dutch ?
SCHAEFER: You 've been pushing too many Pencils , Dillon . Had enough ?
DILLON: No way , old buddy .
SCHAEFER: You never did know when to quit .
DILLON: That piece of work you guys pulled off at the Berlin embassy last week was really something . Blew the entry points on three floors and neutralized the opposition in eight seconds flat . Beautiful .
SCHAEFER: Like the old days , Dillon .
DILLON: Also heard that you passed on that little job in Libya .
SCHAEFER: Was n't my style . We 're a escue unit , not assassins . This must be good . Big shot from the CIA , leaves his desk to come back to the bush . What 's so important ?
DILLON: Those cabinet members are very important to our scope of operations in this part of the world . They 're about to get squeezed . We ca n't let that happen . I needed someone who could get the jo done , quick and quietno screw-ups . I needed the best . The best . So , I pulled a few strings at the State Departmentand here we are .
SCHAEFER: Go on . Dillon goes to the map .
DILLON: The set-up is simple , Dutch . One day job . We pick up thei trail at the chopper , run 'em down , grab the hostages and ounce back across the order before anyone knows we were there . You 've done it a hundred times . Nothing out of the ordinary . Schaefer considers this .
SCHAEFER: And nothing we ca n't handle alone . Philips breaks in .
PHILIPS: I 'm afraid those are you orders , Major . Once you each your objective , Dillon will evaluate the situation and take charge .
DILLON: Not to worry , Dutch . I have n't lost my edge . They 've got a head start on us in some real tough country , otherwise , believe me , it 's a piece of cake .
PHILIPS: Gentlemen , we 're losing time . You 'd better get your men eady . Good luck , Major .
PILOT ONE: Redbird Two , Two . Bearing south , three , five , zero , one o'ckock on the saddle ridge . Over .
PILOT TWO: Roger , Blue Leader . Three , five , zero , on your move . Over .
HAWKINS: Hey , Billy , how many marines does it take to eat a squirrel ?
RAMIREZ: Get that stinkin ' thing out of my face , Blain !
BLAIN: bunch of slack-jawed faggots around here this stuff will put hai guaranteed make you a God-damned sexual ty-ran-toe-sore-ass just like me .
DILLON: Our rendezvous points and adio freqs . are indicated and fixed . AWACS contact on four hour intervals .
SCHAEFER: Who 's our back-up on this ?
DILLON: No such thing , old buddy . It 's a one way ticket . Once we cross that border , we 're on our own .
SCHAEFER: This gets better by the minute .
DILLON: Man , that 's a real bad habit you 've got .
SCHAEFER: You never were all that smartlet 's go ! ! ! Schaefer signals . Men leap from the chopper .
RAMIREZ: The pilots have each got one ound in the head . And whoeve hit it stripped the shit out of it .
SCHAEFER: Took 'em out with a heat seeker .
RAMIREZ: There 's something else , Major
SCHAEFER: Mmmnnn ?
RAMIREZ: I do n't think that was any ordinary army taxi Schaefer looks at him quizically .
DILLON: Have you picked up their trail yet ?
SCHAEFER: Billy 's on it . Heat seeker . Pretty sophisticated for half-asses mountain boys .
DILLON: They 're getting better equipped every day . Bill approaches from the b.g .
BILLY: Major , looks like there were ten , maybe twelve guerrillas . Looks like they took some prisoners from the chopper . Then a different set of track , over there .
SCHAEFER: What do you mean ?
BILLY: Six others , U.S. issue jungle oots . They came in from the north , then followed the guerrillas . Schaefer turns to Dillon .
SCHAEFER: Mean anything to you ?
DILLON: Probably another rebel patrol . They operate in here all the time .
SCHAEFER: Get ahead , see what you can find . Slow and easy .
SCHAEFER: What 's he got ?
RAMIREZ: Same business , guerrillas hauling two guys from the chopperfollowed by men with American equipment
RAMIREZ: Holy Mother
SCHAEFER: J.S . Davis , Captain , U.S. Army
SCHAEFER: I knew this man . Green Berets , out of Fort Bragg . What the hell were they doing in here ? You got any answers for this , Dillon ?
DILLON: Jesusthis is inhuman . UhI was n't told of any operations in this area . They should n't have been here .
SCHAEFER: Well somebody sent them .
RAMIREZ: Must have run into the guerrillas Fucking animals . Mac moves alongside Blain .
MAC: Ai n't no way for a soldier to die . Time to let 'ol 'painless ' out of the bag .
SCHAEFER: What happened here , Billy ? Billy looks at him , puzzled .
BILLY: Strange , Major . There was a firefight . Shooting in all directions .
SCHAEFER: I ca n't believe Jim Hoppe walked into an ambush .
BILLY: I do n't believe he did , Sir . I could n't find a single track . Just does n't make sense .
SCHAEFER: What about the rest of Hopper 's men ? Billy shakes his head .
BILLY: No sign . They never left here Major . It 's like they just disappeared . Schaefer ponders a moment . Then , to Billy
SCHAEFER: Stick with the guerilla trail . Let 's get it over with . We move . Five meter spread . No sound . Nothing .
BLAIN: Payback time .
MAC: You 're ghostin ' on me , mothe fokaaa ! I do n't care who you are back in the world You give away our position again and I 'll bleed you quiet and leave your fuckin ' ass ight here . Got it ?
BLAIN: Say , Bull . What 's goin ' down ? We got movement ?
MAC: No . Shithead with his trenchcoat and dee-coda-da ing was makin ' enough noise to get us all waxed . I do n't like that guy . Do n't like him at my back . I ai n't winding up like those astards back there .
BLAIN: I know what you mean , Bull , ut do n't sweat it , me and 'ol 'painless ' here are watchin ' the front door .
MAC: As always , bro They do a gentle fist dap and smile warmly at each other . Two men who have seen it all ,
DILLON: Ready , kid ?
DILLON: On your nine ! ! !
SCHAEFER: Stick around .
SCHAEFER: Down ! ! !
HAWKINS: You got it , Major !
SCHAEFER: Any sign of the hostages ?
MAC: We found 'em both , dead . And the gear from the chopper . If they 're Central American ,
SCHAEFER: Good work , Mac . Clear the area , no traces . Get the men eady to move .
SCHAEFER: Shit
RAMIREZ: You 're hit . You 're bleedin ' , man . Blain looks briefly at the wound .
BLAIN: Ai n't got time to bleed .
BLAIN: Son of a bitch 's dug in like a Alabama tick jack us around all day .
RAMIREZ: Hell , dude , we do n't have all day .
BLAIN: Shit , Pancho ! ! !
RAMIREZ: What 's your problem , dude ?
DILLON: This is beautiful ! More than we ever thought . We got the astards !
SCHAEFER: I think this is the one you want . Dillon reads it .
DILLON: Two daysthat 's all we had . In two days , three hundred of these bastards would have been equipped with all this . Afte they crossed the border , it would have taken a year to stop them . We 've averted a majo guerrilla invasion , Dutch
SCHAEFER: It was all bullshit . All of it . From the startyou set us up , got us in here to do you dirty work .
DILLON: That 's right , I set you up . You 're a veteran at this , Dutch , I had to .
SCHAEFER: Why us ?
DILLON: Because I told you , you 're the est . I knew you could do it but I could n't get you in here without a cover story .
SCHAEFER: What story did you give to Davis ?
DILLON: We 've been lookin ' for this place for months . The choppe must have gotten close when
SCHAEFER: That 's your problem , Dillon . You always did put ambition efore the lives of your men . My men are not expendable . I do n't do this kind of work . This is your dirty little war , not mine .
HAWKINS: Major !
DILLON: Are you all right ?
HAWKINS: Major , we stepped into some eal shit here . I got a hook-up with aerial surveillance .
SCHAEFER: Movement ?
SCHAEFER: How much time ?
SCHAEFER: Tell Mac we move in five . He starts to walk away .
DILLON: She goes with us .
SCHAEFER: We take her and she 'll give away our position , every chance she gets . No prisoners , Dillon .
DILLON: You 're still under orders , Dutch . You want to make the call , or should I ?
SCHAEFER: I 'm getting my men out of this damn jungle , Dillon . She 's your baggage . You fall behind , you 're on your own .
BILLY: Looks bad , Major . It 's gon na be a real bitch . If we follow above the river and then down , here , at this canyon , we might find a way out . Schaefer turns to Ramirez , kneeling close by .
SCHAEFER: Not much choice . Pancho , take the lead . Double time it .
ANNA: You touch me again , pig , and I will cut off your balls !
DILLON: It 's a long walk back , make it easy on yourself .
MAC: Hey , Dillon , over here . Dillon does n't respond .
DILLON: Yeah , what is it , Sergeant ?
ANNA: When my people catch you , you 'll wish you were him .
DILLON: Thanks .
MAC: Anytime .
HUNTER: Dillon , over here .
MAC: I 've seen some badass bush efore , but nothin ' like this , man . Little taste ' o home ?
BLAIN: I hear you bro , this is some shit . Makes Cambodia look like Kansas . Lose your way in here , man , you be in some kinda hurt .
DILLON: Shit . Come on
RAMIREZ: Do n't try it .
DILLON: Watch her .
SCHAEFER: What 's got Billy so spooked ?
MAC: Ca n't say , Majorbeen squirrely all mornin ' fuckin ' weirdsometimes I think that nose of his is too goodsmells things that ai n't there .
SCHAEFER: What is it ?
BILLY: Somethingin the trees
SCHAEFER: It'snothing
BILLY: It 's nothing
HAWKINS: Please She looks at the weapon , to Hawkins and then ,
ANNA: Look out , behind you ! ! ! Hawkins spins
SCHAEFER: It 's not her blood .
RAMIREZ: Major , you 'd better take a look at this .
SCHAEFER: Hawkins ?
RAMIREZ: I ca n't tell .
SCHAEFER: What in God 's name ?
RAMIREZ: I think it 's Hawkins .
SCHAEFER: Where the hell is his body ?
RAMIREZ: There 's no sign of it .
SCHAEFER: Ramirez , ask her what happened .
RAMIREZ: She saysthe jungle came alive , and took him
DILLON: That is n't what she said she said she does n't make sense .
RAMIREZ: Couple of sappers been trailing us all the way from the camp , Major . Billy heard them . She set us up , ran for itThey were waiting . I should 've wasted the bitch when I had the chance .
SCHAEFER: Why did n't they take the adio and his weapon ? Why did n't she escape ?
DILLON: They did the same thing to Davis
SCHAEFER: I want him found . Sweep pattern and double back . Fifty meters .
BLAIN: Come on in you fuckerscome on in . 'ol 'painless ' is waitin '
MAC: Contact , 30 Right ! ! !
MAC: Isaw it .
SCHAEFER: You saw what ?
MAC: I saw it .
SCHAEFER: Blain Just like the othersno powder burns , no shrapnel .
DILLON: The wound all fused , cauterizedwhat the hell did this ?
SCHAEFER: Mac !
MAC: I do n't know . Goddamn it , somethingI saw something/ .
RAMIREZ: Nothing . The same thing . Not a fucking trace . No odies , blood , anything .
SCHAEFER: We 're losing the light . Mac , I want a defensive position above this ridge , mined with everything we 're got . Man is again the hardened professional .
MAC: Yessir .
SCHAEFER: Put him in his poncho and liner and carry him back . We 'll bury him in the morning .
MAC: I 'll take him .
MAC: We 've got most of the flares , frags . and two claymores just outside . Nothin 's comin ' close to here without trippin ' on somethin ' .
SCHAEFER: Thank you , Sergeant .
MAC: The best friend I ever had .
DILLON: Blazer One , say again A CRACKLE of STATIC over the radio .
BLAZER ONE: Red Fox , I say again . You equest for extraction denied . Your area still compromised . Proceed to Sector 3000 fo prisoner extraction , Priority Alpha . Next contact at 1030 hours .
DILLON: Roger , Blazer One . 1030 hoursdamn , bastards .
SCHAEFER: Expendable assets , Dillon . Seems Langley is never around when you need them .
DILLON: I can accept that , it comes with the job .
SCHAEFER: Bullshit . You 're just like the rest of us .
RAMIREZ: Shit load o ' good a chopper 'd do us in here anyway . Dillon turns to Mac .
DILLON: Mac . Who hit us today ?
MAC: Do n't know , only saw one of 'em . Camouflaged . He was there Those fucking eyes
DILLON: What , Sergeant ?
MAC: Those eyesdisappeared . But I know one thing , Major I drew down and fired ight at it . Capped-off two hundred rounds and then the Mini-gun ; the full pack . Nothin'nothin ' on this earth could have livednot at that range .
DILLON: Ask her again . What did she see ? What happened to Hawkins ?
RAMIREZ: She says the same thing It was the jungle
RAMIREZ: You know something Billy , what is it ?
BILLY: I 'm scared . Ramirez is frightened by this .
RAMIREZ: Bullshit . You ai n't afraid of no man .
BILLY: There 's something out there , waiting for usit ai n't no man .
DILLON: He 's losing his cool . There 's nothing out there but a couple of men that we 're going to have to take down .
SCHAEFER: You still do n't get it , do you Dillon ? He took Davis and now he wants us .
MAC: It 's the same kinda jungle , Bro , same moon everything a real number ten night . Remember Bro ? Only you and me , the only one 's out of the whole fuckin ' platoon who made it out . His eyes probe the darkness , remembering .
MAC: I promise you this , Bro whoever he is , I hope he 's plannin ' to hit us again 'cause he 's got my name on 'em .
MAC: Got the motherfucker
RAMIREZ: Holy shit , Mac .
SCHAEFER: Get a field dressing on that ight away . Suddenly he remembers , Anna .
BILLY: Major , over here .
RAMIREZ: Came in through the trip wires , took it right out from under our noses
BILLY: Boar set off the trip flare , Major . No other tracks .
RAMIREZ: How could anyone get through
RAMIREZ: Why did n't he try to kill one of us last night ? Schaefer looks at him .
SCHAEFER: He came back for the body . He 's killing us , one at a time
SCHAEFER: Yesterday . What did you see ? She stares back at him .
DILLON: You 're wastin ' your time .
SCHAEFER: No more games .
ANNA: I do n't know what it was . It
SCHAEFER: Go on .
ANNA: It changes colors , like the chameleon . It uses the jungle
DILLON: Shit , you trying to tell me Blain and Hawkins were killed y a fucking lizard ? Do n't listen to her . Its 's a psych-job .
SCHAEFER: What 's you name ? She looks back into his eyes .
ANNA: Anna .
SCHAEFER: Anna . He 's hunting us . You know that ?
DILLON: What the hell do you think you 're doing ?
DILLON: What are you talking about ?
ANNA: There is something else . When the big man was killed , you must have wounded it . It 's blood was on the leaves .
SCHAEFER: If it bleeds , we can kill it .
SCHAEFER: He 'll be looking for the trip wires . If we 're lucky , he wo n't see this .
DILLON: Now what , Dutch . You going to send your mystery guest an invitation ?
SCHAEFER: You 're catching on , Dillon .
ANNA: When I was little we find a man like a butcher . The old ones in the village cross themselves and whisper crazy things . 'Demonio , cazador de trofoesOnly the hottest times of the hottest years ' Crazy thingsThis year is grows hot . And we begin finding our men . We find them sometimes without their skin . Sometimesmuch , much worse . Cazado de trofoesmeans the demon who takes trophies .
DILLON: What 'll you try next cheese ? Schaefer glares at him . Turns to go
DILLON: Satisfied ? Now let 's get the hell out
DILLON: What is God 's name ?
SCHAEFER: Mac !
DILLON: No way , Dutch . I 'm going . You get these people and get the hell out of here .
SCHAEFER: This is n't your style , Dillon .
DILLON: Guess I 've picked up some bad habits from you , Dutch . Now do n't argue with me , you know I 'm right . Get to that chopper and hold it for us . We 'll be along .
SCHAEFER: You know you ca n't win this one . Dillon stares at him .
DILLON: You know me , Dutch , I neve did know when to quit . Dillon turns and begins to move out .
SCHAEFER: Dillon !
DILLON: Right behind you .
BILLY: He 's busted up , bad , Major .
RAMIREZ: I can make it , Major .
SCHAEFER: Come on , Poncho , we 're getting out of here . Billy , take the radio , leave the rest . Come on !
MAC: Come on , you motherfucker !
VOICE: Dillon , over here .
DILLON: Mac ?
MAC: Out there . Past the rocks can you see it ?
DILLON: I see it ! We 're gon na take this thing .
MAC: Right , I got a score to settle for the Bro
DILLON: We both got scores to settle .
DILLON: MacMac .
SCHAEFER: Billy ! ! !
SCHAEFER: Get back , into the rocks !
SCHAEFER: You could n't see me .
SCHAEFER: One chance , that 's all .
ANNA'S VOICE: Look out , behind you ! ! !
SCHAEFER: Anna ? Tracelike he moves towards the sound .
SCHAEFER: Anna ?
HUNTER: Dillon , over here
SCHAEFER: Bleed , you bastard .
HUNTER: Who the hell are You ?
PILOT: Holy , fuck , what was that ? ! ! !
PHILIPS: Orbit rightcheck it out !
ANNA: NOOOOOO ! ! ! ! ! !
MEDIC: Looks like he 's been through hellca n't believe he 's still alive . What the hell went on down there ?
PHILIPS: If it had n't been for her , he 'd e dead now . That story she told usI still ca n't believe it .
STAGEHAND: Where 'd you think you 're going ? !
BEARDED MAN: I 'm part of the act , you fool !
CUTTER: Who was that ?
PROSECUTOR: And did Robert Angier , the Great Danton , your employer , get to that final part of his trick that night ?
CUTTER: No , sir . Something went wrong .
PROSECUTOR: What went wrong ?
CUTTER: I saw a someone head below the stage I followed and I found
PROSECUTOR: Would you describe your occupation to the jury please , Mr.Cutter ?
CUTTER: I 'm an ingeneur . I design illusions and construct the apparatus necessary for perfoming them .
PROSECUTOR: And for how long had you been Mr.Angier 's `` ingeneur '' ?
CUTTER: Eight years . I was privvy to the secrets of his entire act .
PROSECUTOR: So , Mr.Cutter , was this water-filled tank beneath the stage part of Mr.Angier 's illusion- the illusion illed as `` THE REAL TRANSPORTED MAN '' ?
CUTTER: No , sir . The tank had been used fo the first trick , then taken offstage . Borden must have put it under the trap door after the interval .
DEFENDER: How large was this tank ?
CUTTER: The sort of tank used for underwate escapes- four or five hundred gallons .
DEFENDER: How do you think Mr.Borden was able to move the tank under the trap doo without anyone noticing ?
CUTTER: Ask him- he 's the magician .
IMPATIENT: I ask again that this man explain the mechanics of Mr.Angier 's illusion .
ANGRY: If I reveal my magician 's secrets here in open court , I 'll be unemployable and the secrets will be worthless . The Real Transported Man is the most sought-after illusion in the business and I have te right to sell it on .
JUDGE: Mr.Cutter , I see your predicament ut we are talking about a capital offence- Alfred Borden 's life hangs in the balance . Cutter looks down . Quiet .
ADDRESSES LAWYERS: Might this be an acceptable compromisse ?
CAPTAIN: I 'm going to have to ask you to turn out your pockets . Owens raises his eyebrows .
TO WARDERS: Check the locks . Twice .
OWENS: My name is Owens- I 'm a solicitor . Borden says nothing .
BORDEN: How much ?
OWENS: Lord Caldlow is interested in-
COLD: How much for my tricks ?
OWENS: Five thousand pounds .
BORDEN: Talk to Fallon , my ingenuer- the money 's for him .
OWENS: I did . He offered to sell all of your tricks except the most valuable one - The Transported Man .
BORDEN: I 'd never forgive myself for selling my greatest trick .
OWENS: Even for your daughter ?
BORDEN: Fallon can take care of-
OWENS: Bernard Fallon ? A man with a past even more obscure than your own ? The court have already motioned to have the girl removed from his `` care '' . No , the girl is to be an orphan . I 've been to the work house Owens looks around the prison yard . Shrugs .
BOUND JOURNAL: As a show of good faith . He thought it might be of interest .
BORDEN: Angier never learned my trick .
OWENS: Really ? When he returned from Colorado he mounted a version of the Transported Man that the papers said was better , even
WITH RELISH: Than your original .
ACID: If you want Angier 's secret you can dig him up and ask him for yourself . Borden TURNS , dragging the Warders with him .
OWENS: I want your secret , Mr.Borden
LOUDER: Consider your daughter !
DISBELIEF: The whole town has electricity ?
ANGIER: Quit a reception .
MANAGER: You 're our first guest of the season , Mr.Angier . Your telegram did n't indicate how long you would be staying with us .
ANGIER: As long as it takes .
SIGNS BOOK: I 'll need a coach tomorrow to take me up the mountain .
MANAGER: The peak is closed , sit . Fo scientific experimentation .
SMILES: That 's why I 'm here .
DRIVER: You have to walk the reat , I 'm afraid , sir .
SHOTGUN: I 'm amazed at how many of you newspaper writers ca n't read mu sign .
ANGIER: Not the welcome I was expecting . Shotgun RECOGNIZES Angier , AMAZED .
SHOTGUN: I know you . You 're that magician-the Great Danton . I 'm Alley . I saw your show . IN London . Seven times- you guessed every object the audience had in their pockets .
ALLEY: I 'm sorry about the fence . People keep interfering with our work .
ANGIER: I 've come to see Tesla .
ALLEY: Why ?
ANGIER: He built a machine for a- for a colleague of mine . A long time ago . Can you get me a meeting with him ? I 've come a very long way .
ALLEY: Impossible , I 'm afraid .
ANGIER: I 've brought a lot of money . Beat .
ALLEY: I 'm sorry , Mr.Angier . I simply ca n't help you . Alley pulls the fence closed .
ANGIER: I 'll be staying at the hotel . Indefinitely .
ALLEY: What am I holding ? Angier does n't look back .
ANGIER: Your watch .
MILTON: Which of you brave souls is willing to bind this lovely young woman
BORDEN: Milton 's squadering their goodwill or a bunch of tired second-hand tricks-
AMUSED: Old favourites , please .
BORDEN: What about something fresh ? He wo n't even try a bullet catch-
ANGIER: He ca n't use plants for every trick .
JULIA: There 'd be no seats left for the punters .
BORDEN: Fine- no bullet catch . But a real magician tries to invent something new , something other magicians scratch their heads over-
CUTTER: They sells it to them for a small fortune . Cutter hands Angier some money .
ANGIER: Actually , I do .
CUTTER: Care to sell it ?
BORDEN: No one else could do my trick .
ANGIER: I could .
BORDEN: You do n't even know what it is .
ANGIER: Show it to me twice , I 'll do it . Cutter looks at Borden , thoughtful .
CUTTER: I admire your spirit , Mr.Angier . But if Borden here really has invented his masterpiece it might well be something only he can do .
ANGIER: Why ?
CUTTER: It might be something only he is prepared to do . my illusions employer , Mr.Milton , is a skilled showman . But Borden 's ight- he wo n't get his hands dirty . You want to see what it takes to make real magic- go to the Tenley . There 's a Chinaman there who 's got what it takes .
ANGIER: Chung Ling Soo .
BORDEN: Tickets are pricey .
CUTTER: I know a lad on the door . You two watch his show- whoever tells me how he does his goldfish bowl trick gets the prize .
ANGIER: Which is ? Cutter gives a sly smile .
CUTTER: Ten minutes onstage in front of my old friend , Mr.Ackerman . Angier and Borden prick up at the name .
JULIA: Who 's Ackerman ?
BORDEN: The most powerful theatrical agent in London .
CUTTER: I saw you drop the knot again , Borden .
JULIA: I think I had my wrist turned-
IGNORING JULIA: Some nights you just ca n't get it , can you ? If that knot slips when Julia 's on the hoist she 'll break a leg .
DEFENSIVE: It 's the wrong knot . A Langford double would hold tighter .
CUTTER: The Langford double 's not a wet knot it 's too dangerous . The ropes could swell and she 'd never slip it-
JULIA: I can slip a Lanford underwater .
BORDEN: We 've been practiced it-
CUTTING IN: He said no . Julia glances at Angier .
TO BORDEN: No more mistakes .
ANGIER: Where 's he from ?
CUTTER: Where are you from ? Angier nods . Fair enough .
ANGIER: He works for another magician ? Are n't you worried he 'll steal your tricks ?
SHAKES HEAD: He does n't deal in methods .
ANGIER: How do you know ?
SLY SMILE: Because I hired him to try and find out Virgil 's orange trick .
ANGIER: I do n't know if I trust him .
CUTTER: He 's a natural magician . Of course you ca n't trust him .
JULIA: I think he 's alright . Angier turns to Julia . Smiles .
ANGIER: You think everyone 's alright .
JULIA: Even you . Julia kisses Angier . Cutter rises .
CUTTER: And Mr.Angier ? Learn your aight lines- if I can see you sneaking a peck on your wife 's ankle from the wings , the blokes on each end of rows 3 and 4 can , too .
BORDEN: Look- he 's all right . He 's fine .
SNIFFS: But where 's his brother ?
BORDEN: Sharp lad , your son .
LAUGHS: My brother . Borden smiles back .
BORDEN: You 're the lucky one tonight .
BOY: It 's got two heads .
BORDEN: Never . Show . Anyone .
SARAH: He lives with Mum .
BORDEN: And you ?
SARAH: I think so . Wil I see you again ?
ANGIER: You 're wrong . It ca n't be .
BORDEN: It is . He carries the bowl between his knees for the entire performance .
ANGIER: but look at the man !
ANGIER: I can barely lift this thing and it 's not even filled with water . O fish . He must be strong as an ox .
INCREDULOUS: He 's been preteding to be an cripple for years ?
ANGIER: Any time he 's in public . Any time he goes out . It 's unthinkable .
JULIA: You 're pretending to be someone else .
ANGIER: I do n't think changing your name compares .
JULIA: Not just your name- who you are , where you 're from
ANGIER: I promised my family I would n't embarrass them with my theatrical endeavors . Angier cuddles up to Julia .
JULIA: I came up with a name for you `` The Great Danton ''
ANGIER FROWNS: You do n't like it ? It 's sophisticated .
ANGIER: It 's French .
SARAH: Alfred ? !
BORDEN: We have our routine for Ackerman ! The other man turns- it is Fallon .
COLD: We have n't had the pleasure .
BORDEN: Mr.Fallon is my ingeneur-
SARAH: Where did yo get all of-
BORDEN: Begged , borrowed and do n't ask . Mr.Fallon 's an enterprising soul .
SARAH: I need talk to you .
BORDEN: We 'll start making money once we have our audience-
SARAH: And until then ? What I earn is barely enough for us .
SHRUGS: I 'll give him half of my food . Sarah looks meaningfully at Borden .
SARAH: You 're already going to be sharing it with someone else . Borden looks at her , confused . Then realizes .
BORDEN: You 're ?
SARAH: Having a baby .
BORDEN: The trick to wake up Ackerman at the end of my audition .
SARAH: Your great trick ? The `` masterpiece that will make our fortunes '' ?
BORDEN: No . The world is n't ready for that one , yet .
SARAH: I 'm not letting you get shot .
BORDEN: It 's perfectly safe . Shoot me .
SARAH: Show me . Then you 're not doing it . I ca n't aise a child on my own , Alfred .
BORDEN: The bullet goes in the gun . Then comes the ramrod .
SARAH: Once you know it 's so obvious .
BORDEN: Yes , well , people still get killed perfoming it .
SARAH: How ?
BORDEN: Sme smart-arse drops something down the barrel .
SARAH: Such as ?
BORDEN: A penny , or a button . Or , of course , a bullet . But do n't fret-
SARAH: Say it again .
BORDEN: I love you .
BORDEN: What ?
SMILES: Some days , it 's not true . Todayt you do n't mean it . Maybe today you 're more in love with magic than me .
OFF LOOK: It 's alright . I like being able to tell the difference- it makes the days it is true mean something . Borden shakes his head , grinning .
BORDEN: Bloody fool . Borden TOSSES the book across the cell .
JUDGE: What 's in there ?
CUTTER: Angier 's machine .
JUDGE: You built this , Mr.Cutter ?
SHAKES HEAD: Oh no . This was n't built by a magician it was built by a wizard .
OFF LOOK: A man who can actually do the things a magician pretends to
JUDGE: They 've benn sold to a Lord Caldlo . An avid collector , apparently very interested in the case .
CUTTER: Do n't let him take this .
JUDGE: Why ever not ?
CUTTER: It 's dangerous .
JUDGE: I 'm sure beneath its bells and whistles it 's get some simple and disappointing trick .
CUTTER: The most disappointing of all- it has no trick . It 's real .
JUDGE: This is the tank Angier drowned in ?
CUTTER: This lets the performer 's hands reach the trick padlock -a small section POPS open .
JUDGE: A standard magical apparatus fo escapes ?
CUTTER: With one important difference Cutter grabs the PADLOCK . Rattles it .
JUDGE: What a way to kill someone . Why in God 's name go to such lengths ?
CUTTER: These are magicians , you honour . Showmen . Men who live by dressing up plain and sometimes brutal truths to amaze . To shock .
JUDGE: Even without and audience ? Cutter stares at the tank-
CUTTER: There was and audience . See , the water tank had a particula signinficance for the two men
MILTON: Which of you brave souls is willing ind this lovely young woman ?
ANGIER: How can be not know ? !
BORDEN: `` How can be not know ? ! ''
STARTS LAUHING: Because , Angier , life is complicated , people are complicated , knots are
JUDGE: Alfred Borden , you have been found guilty of the murder of Robert Angier . You will , in one month 's time , be hanged by the neck until dead . May the Lord have mercy on your soul . Borden barely reacts .
BORDEN: They took her away ?
FALLON NODS: To the workhouse ?
OFF LOOK: It 's for the best .
ALLEY: Tesla sends me down here during the storms . Perfect excuse to come shere a drink with the Great Danton . Alley sits , gesturing to a waiter .
TO WAITER: Two of 'em .
TO ANGIER: Beautiful , is n't it ? I do miss New York , though .
ANGIER: Why are you here ?
ALLEY: The lightning lives here . And noit much else- our work is secret .
ANGIER: My profession also deals in secrets .
ALLEY: Which is ? Angier smiles as he reaches for the notebook .
ANGIER: We magicians have a circle of trust .
ALLEY: You have a circle of trust with someone whose dairy you stole ?
ANGIER: Maybe I bought it .
ALLEY: Magicians sell their secrets ?
ANGIER: It 's how we pay for our retirements and how greats tricks outlive us .
ALLEY: You 're hoping to find a great secretin there ?
ANGIER: I 've already found it . That 's why I 'm here .
ALLEY: Why would you want the same thing ?
ANGIER: Call it a professional rivalry .
ALLEY: Tesla has built unusual machines fo unusual people , but he would neve talk about it .
ANGIER: I understand discretion . I just want the machine . Alley looks at Angier . Thinking .
ALLEY: Finish your drink . You 'll have a special appreciation for our work .
ANGIER: I thought it was a secret .
SMILES: You 're a magician . Who 's going to elieve you ?
ALLEY: We do our tests when the townspeople are asleep- Mr.Tesla does n't want to scare anyone . Alley checks his wacth by the moonlight .
ANGIER: Where are the wires ?
ALLEY: Exactly .
ANGIER: Where 's the generator ?
ALLEY: You saw it last week .
ANGIER: But that must be ten miles from here .
ALLEY: Fifteen . And I have to ride all of them before I get to bed . I 'll send word for you in a few days , Mr.Angier .
VOICE: Get out your gun , Professor !
BORDEN: A volunteer .
QUIET: Yes .
SMILES: I think not .
ANGIER: Never thought I 'd find an answer at the bottom of a pint glass .
CUTTER: Has n't stopped you looking .
ANGIER SITS: I heard about a booking . Nice little theatre . Good up-and-coming magician .
ANGIER: Who ?
CUTTER: You .
ANGIER: You got me a booking ? Why ? Cutter looks down into his beer .
CUTTER: Because I want to keep working And who 's going to hire the ingeneu who killed Julia McCullough in front of a sellout crowd at the Orpheum ? Angier looks back at Cutter .
ANGIER: Someone who know that it was n't you fault . Someone who knows Alfred Borden and his repertoire of exotic knots .
CUTTER: Heard he had a spot of bad luck doing a bullet catch South of the river . Angier looks down at the liquid in his glass .
ANGIER: To die like that . Locked in water lungs screaming
SHAKES HEAD: What did she go through , Cutter ? Cutter watches Angier 's distress .
CUTTER: I knew an old sailor . Told me about a time he got pulled over the side tangled in the sheets they dragged him out , but it was five minutes efore he coughed Angier stares at Cutter . Hanging .
ANGIER: Which knot did Borden tie that night ?
CUTTER: He would n't say .
ANGIER: Would n't say ? !
CUTTER: It was as if as if he did n't know .
LOOKS AROUND: But this should do .
ANGIER: We should see about an assistant .
CUTTER: I 've made arrangements . Have you settled on a name ?
ANGIER: Yes , I have . The Great Danton .
CUTTER: Hmm . Bit old-fashioned ? Angier smiles gently at Cutter .
ANGIER: No . It 's sophisticated .
OLIVIA: What 's so hard about this ?
CUTTER: In here , Miss Wenscombe . No point meeting Mr.Angier unless you fit .
SMILES: I suppose I should let her out .
SARAH: I do n't understand , Alfred . How can it be bleeding again ?
SNAPS: We can ' afford the doctor back !
SARAH: You 've woken her .
BORDEN: I 'm sorry . I just need this to heal so I can het back to work . Sarah looks at Borden . Reluctantly .
SARAH: Alfred , you have to face things . What tricks could you peform with this kind of injury ?
BORDEN: Some of the card pulls , prop tricks And the trick I 've been telling you about . The trick they 'll remembe me for .
ANGIER: The bird cage ca n't be our climax- everybody knows it .
CUTTER: Not like this , they do n't .
ANGIER: And I do n't want to kill doves .
SNAPS: Then stay off the stage . You 're a magician , not a wizard- you have to get your hands dirty to achieve the impossible .
ANGIER: You sound like him .
CUTTER: Put your hands on the sides
ANGIER: I need a volunteer .
CUTTER: Hang on , hang on
MERRIT: You 'd beat not be intending to hut this animal , Mr.Angier .
ANGIER: Of course not .
CUTTER: And the best part
ANGIER: Thought you said I had to get my hands dirty .
CUTTER: Someday , perhaps you will . I needed to know that you can .
MERRIT: Very nice . Very nice indeed .
SMILING: I have n't had a chance to compliment you on your beautiful theatre yet , Mr.Merrit .
MERRIT: A lot more beautiful when it 's full , Mr.Angier .
ANGIER: Do n't worry .
MERRIT: You all say that . Why sould I worry ? If your tricks do n't get 'em in , someone else 's will . Maybe someone willing to do a bullet catch or a water scape .
CUTTER: cheap thrills , Mr.Merrit . People hoping for an accident- and quite likely to see one , too . What would that do for your business ?
SHRUGS: You 've got a week .
ANGIER: You sir , in the hat . Could you show us your handkerchief ?
MAN: This is n't mine .
ANGIER: Perhaps you 'd be so good as to return it to the other man . He has yours .
OLIVIA: I 'm so nervous- I 'm sorry , I 'm making mistakes . Cutter quickly REMOVES Angier 's coat
ANGIER: The audience does n't seem to be esponding much , Cutter .
CUTTER: This is a grand theatre with a sophisticated audience- They 've seen most of these tricks before . But not this next one . You 'll see .
ANGIER: Wish us luc , Cutter .
SMILING: I 'll have the champagne ready .
ANGIER: You 've seen this one before ?
CUTTER: You had a lot of plates spinning .
ANGIER: Do n't suppose they 'll let us do this one again .
CUTTER: No .
ANGIER: So what 's the climax of our show ?
MERRIT: To perform magic- not butcher birds and break my costomer 's fingers ! Clear out , anything here in the morning gets burned . Cutter puts his hand on Merrit 's arms .
CUTTER: Mr.Merrit-
MERRIT: It 's done , John . I 've hired a comedian . You know I hate comedians , which should indicate the may I felel about your friend 's future as a stage magician .
CUTTER: There are plenty of good theatres if we can come up with another trick and change the name of the act-
ANGIER: The name stays . Cutter sees Angier 's resolve .
CUTTER: Right . Well , the new trick will have to be irresistible , then . I 've a couple of methods to try out , but we 'll need a fresh angle on the presentation .
TICKET HAWKER: Would you like to know the future , sir ? The man who kill change the world is speaking right now . Continents divided no more . Free , clean power . The mysteries of the world solved .
TESLA: With a system like this I could have the entire city electrified whitin two years .
YELLS: Fraud .
BORDEN: I love you . Sarah smiles .
SARAH: See ? Today , it 's true .
BORDEN: Guard ! Guard ! ! The viewing slot slides open .
GUARD: What do want , Professor ?
BORDEN: Paper and pencil . Please .
SULLEN: Let me see ?
SMILING: Only if I teach you how to read .
SULLEN: Just stupid tricks , right ? Have n't helped you get out of here-
TUGS CHAINS: Have they ? Or ca n't you open real locks , Professor ?
BORDEN: Perhaps I 'm just biding my time . Perhaps one day I 'll just hold up my
WHISPERS: `` are you wacthing closely '' perhaps say a magic word or two then I 'll e gone .
SULLEN: How 'd you get so famous , then ? Borden STANDS .
BORDEN: Magic .
SULLEN: Oi , Borden , get back here !
EMBARRASSED: I thought you 'd gone . Olivia shifts . Embarrassed .
OLIVIA: I do n't really . have anywhere to go . Angier slips the newspaper from the table .
ANGIER: You 've been sleeping here ?
OLIVIA: Cutter said it would be okay till we get another booking .
BEAT: What are you doing ?
ANGIER: Researching . Part of a magician 's job is to watch his competition , to see what illusions they're-
OLIVIA: You 're going to do something to that man , are n't you ? Olivia moves closer . Angier is quiet .
ANGIER: Even ? My wife for a couple of his fingers ? He has a child now . And he 's perfoming again .
BITTER: Borden is out there , living his life just as he always intended . As if nothing had happened . And look at me . I 'm alone . And no theatre will touch me .
OLIVIA: Us . Olivia moves towards him .
BORDEN: I need a volunteer . Angier takes a few steps towards the stage . Borden produces a RUBBER BALL . he TOSSES the ball to Angier .
TO AUDIENCE: You 're not impressed ?
OLIVIA: What happened , Robert ?
ANGIER: He had a new trick .
OLIVIA: Was it good ?
ANGIER: Did they applaud when you saw it ?
CUTTER: Not very enthusiastically .
ANGIER: He 's a dreadful magician .
CUTTER: He 's a wonderfull magician- he 's a dreadful showman . He does n't know how to dress it up , how to sell the trick .
ANGIER: How does he do it ?
CUTTER: He uses a double .
SHAKES HEAD: It 's not that simple . This is a complex illusion .
CUTTER: You think that because you do n't know the method . It 's a double who comes out at the end . It 's the only way .
ANGIER: I 've seen his perfom ir three times now , Mr. Cutter- the Prestige is the
ANGIER: The same man comes out of the second cabinet . I promise you .
OLIVIA: It is the same man . They both turn to look at Olivia .
ANGIER: He does n't know how to sell his trick to an audience . But I do .
NODS: It would give us our climax .
ANGIER: The man stole my life . I 'm going to steal his trick .
CUTTER: We 'll have to find someone who can look like you on a stage .
ANGIER: He does n't use a double-
IMPACIENT: I do n't know how Borden does it , Robert . So either you wait for Borden to retire and buy his secret , or you can listen to how I would do this trick .
ANGIER NODS: Ang the only way I know is to find you a bloody good double .
ANGIER: Take a good look- let 's get out there and find me .
ALLEY: It 's perfectly safe .
TESLA: So this is the Great Danton .
ANGIER: I saw a lecture you gave in London , several years ago . I 'm flattered you agreed to see me . Tesla keeps hold as Angier 's hand .
TESLA: Our bodies , Mr. Angier , are quite capable of conducting , and indeed , producing energy .
ANGIER: I need something impossible .
TESLA: You 're familiar with a phrase 'Man 's each exceeds his grasp ' ?
ANGIER: If people thought the things I did on stage were real , they would n't clap- they 'd scream . Think of saving a woman in half . Tesla nods . Considering .
TESLA: Mr.Angier , the cost of such a machine-
ANGIER: Price is not an object .
TESLA: Perhaps not . But have you considered the cost ?
ANGIER: I 'm noit sure I follow .
TESLA: I can make your machine , Mr. Angier . But I can also give you some advice
ANGIER: Have your obsessions done you no good ?
TESLA: At first . But I 've followed them too long- I am their slave . Thei whipping boy . And one day they may choose to destroy me . Angier looks into Tesla 's eyes .
ANGIER: if you understand an obsession then you know you wo n't change my mind .
SMILES: So be it .
ANGIER: Will you build it ?
TESLA: I have already begun to build it , Mr. Angier . I hope you enjoy the mountain air . This will take time . Tesla disappears into the lab .
TO TRAMP: Gerry ?
ROOT: A pleasure to meet you fine gentlemen .
WHISPER: Would you like for me to tell you a little joke ?
YELLING: Are you laughing ?
ANGIER: He 's out of his mind .
OLIVIA: He 's an out-of-work actor- of course he 's out of his mind .
CUTTER: He 's perfect . A little work , mind you , but when I 'm done with him he could be your brother .
ANGIER: I do n't need him to be my brother . I need him to be me .
BORDEN: Would you like to see a magic trick ?
SARAH: What is this for ?
BORDEN: You caught me in the wrong mood .
SARAH: But you want through all the-
BORDEN: Sarah , I 'm allowed to change my mind , are n't I ? The act is taking off , maybe soon I 'll get us into a igger theatre . Things will work . Sarah turns and embraces her husband .
OLIVIA: You walk through this one- then ? Angier stands Olivia in front of the door .
SMILES: It 's not for sleeping on . Olivia looks around the below stage area .
OLIVIA: And Root goes up through there ?
ANGIER: It has to be . Borden 's trick is getting noticed . The place was packed today . Olivia looks at him strangely .
OLIVIA: You went and saw his show again ? Angier looks away , embarrassed .
ANGIER: All I have to do is keep myself stinking drunk all the time and no one will be able to tell the difference .
CUTTER: A little faith , sir . Could you favo us with a perfomance . Mr. Root ? Root picks himself up and dusts himself off .
ROOT: You would drink , too , if you know the world half so well as I do .
CUTTER: You can go back to being yourself . Root . For free.. Root looks challengingly at both men .
ROOT: I 'd rather be him , for now . I find it amusing .
CUTTER: Root has to keep a low profile anyone sees him the game 's up .
WATCHING ROOT: I do n't know how you do these things , Cutter . I 'm not sure I want to know .
CUTTER: Have you thought about what we should call the trick ?
ANGIER: No point being coy . Borden calls his trick 'The Transported Man ' ? Cutter nods .
TOAST: To our achivement . They drink .
CUTTER: The manager said he 's never seen a eaction like it . Angier smiles , rueful .
ANGIER: At least he got to see it . I spent the ovation hidden under the stage . No one cares about the man who disappears , the man who goes into the box . They care about the man who comes out the other side .
OLIVIA: I care about the man in the box . Angier turns to Olivia , raises his glass .
ANGIER: Thank you .
TO CUTTER: Maybe we could switch before the trick . That way I could be the Prestige and Root ends up below stage .
SHAKES HEAD: The antecipation of the trick is everything- it needs your showmanship to built suspense . If Root opens his mouth , it 's all over- he ca n't introduce the trick .
CUTTER: Root , you bloody fool , get that costume and makeup off right now , anyone could walk in here !
ANGIER: I suppose I should get more rest .
OLIVIA: Life is not full of these moments , Robbie . Olivia pours him some more champagne .
SOFTLY: It is your wife ? Angier shakes his head , distracted .
ANGIER: The trick is n't good enough . Olivia stares at him .
OLIVIA: Did n't you see the audience ?
ANGIER: No .
OLIVIA: Well , they loved it .
ANGIER: It 's not as good as his trick .
OLIVIA: Borden 's trick is nothing compared to ours . He does n't have any style-
ANGIER: He does n't have to spend the finale hiding under the stage . Angier rises , turning out of her embrace .
OLIVIA: Why ?
ANGIER: So that I can do it better . Angier turns to her . Looks her in the eye .
OLIVIA: Work for him ? Are you joking
ANGIER: You 'll be my spy .
TAKEN ABACK: We just got our start and you want me to leave ?
ANGIER: It 's how we advance .
FRUSTATED: He knows I work for you .
ANGIER: Exactly why he 'll want to hire you . He 'll want my secrets .
OLIVIA: Why would he trust me ? Angier thinks for a second . Then smiles .
ANGIER: Because you 're going to tell him the truth .
TESLA: You must be curious to see what so much money had bought you , Mr. Angier .
ALLEY: You might want to stand back .
TESLA: No , no . It will be fine . Mr. Alley , please proceed .
ANGIER: I do n't understand-
ALLEY: Perhaps it would be best if you left us to it . We 'll see you next week ?
LOOKING AROUND: Interesting workshop .
BORDEN: We make do .
OLIVIA: My name is Olivia Wenscombe .
BORDEN: I know who you are . Are you here to steal the rest of my show ?
OLIVIA: No . I 'm here to give your show what is missing .
BORDEN: And what might that be ?
OLIVIA: Me .
TO FALLON: Was n't I just saying that , Bernard ? A woman 's touch . Fallon leaves , closing the door .
OLIVIA: I 've left Angier . I want a job . Borden sits there .
BORDEN: Why on earth should n't I trust you ? The mistress of my enemy . Olivia is taken aback . Chanes tack .
OLIVIA: Mr.Borden-
BORDEN: Alfred .
OLIVIA: Alfred . I 'm going to tell you the truth .
BORDEN: Ah . The truth . A slippery notion in our life of work , Miss Wenscombe .
OLIVIA: I 'm here because he sent me here . He wants me to come and work for you and steal your secret .
BORDEN: What does he need my secret for ? His trick is top notch . The Great Danton vanishes and isntantly eappears on the other side of the stage mute , overweight , and , unless I 'm mistaken , rather drunk . Borden rises , moves closer to Olivia .
OLIVIA: No . It 's killing him . he 's obsessed with discovering your method . He thinks of nothing else , and takes no pleasure in our sucess . I 've had enough . There 's no future with him . He sent me here to steal your secrets , ut I 've actually come to offer you his .
BORDEN: He has no secrets from me . Borden stares at her , unsure .
CUTTER: Best be getting changed for the martinee , sir . - Angier nods . Cutter REALIZES .
SNIFFS: And even more drunk than usual . Get yourself below stairs , right away !
ROOT: No .
CUTTER: No ? ! Root looks at Cutter with genuine malice .
ROOT: We need to have a chat , Mr.Cutter .
ANGIER: We have a problem , Cutter .
CUTTER: We have a bigger problem . Root .
ANGIER: Do n't tell me he fell over again .
CUTTER: Worse . He realized he can make demands .
ANGIER: He 's blackmailing us ?
CUTTER: In a word , yes . I 'm surprised , to e honest- it usually takes them a lot longer to figure it out .
ANGIER: How much does he want ?
CUTTER: It makes no difference- we have to stop doing the trick .
WIELDS PAPER: Stop doing the trick ? Look at this .
CUTTER: Look at yesterday 's . And last week 's , where they called you `` London 's premiere stage performer '' , not `` magician '' mind . Performer . Of any kind .
ANGIER: What 's the point ?
CUTTER: My point , Robert , is that you 've climbed too high to get away with any kind of professional embarrassament . We 're not doing any tricks we ca n't control . Angier considers this . Nods . Thinking .
ANGIER: Pay him whatever he wants , for now . We keep doing the trick till Borden opens , then we 'll phase it out .
HISSES: Get up there ! !
CUTTER: Get it down !
ROOT: To what do I owe the pleasure of this rather welcome pint of ale ?
BORDEN: You are the Great Danton , are n't you ? Root gestures silence , glancing around them .
ROOT: Of course I am . But do n't advertise it- I 'll be mobbed with fans . And who might you be ?
BORDEN: Just a humble admirer . And fellow practitioner .
ROOT: Ah , very good .
BORDEN: Another ?
ROOT: If you insist . I 'm not perfoming tonight . Well , only one show , and , to be frank , my people pretty much un things these days .
BORDEN: You could probably do it blindfolded .
ROOT: Bloody good idea .
BORDEN: Have it .
ROOT: Thanks . A new pint arrives . Root sips .
BORDEN: Actually , there 's something I might warn you about .
ROOT: Oh ?
BORDEN: Well , it 's your Transported Man illusion . Now , I 'm noit claiming to know your method but I had a similar trick in my act- and I used ( looks around ,
WHISPERING: a double .
ROOT: Oh , I see , very good .
BORDEN: At first . Then it went bad . You se , I had n't counted on the fact that once I incorporated this bloke into my act , he had complete powe over me .
ROOT: Complete power , you say ?
NODDING GRAVELY: Weel , he was the secret , you see . And the more successful I became , the more outrageous his demands ecame . He practically backrupted me . In the end I had to stop performing the illusion completely . You must be very careful about giving someone that power over you .
ROOT: Thanks for the warning .
ANGIER: some of you may be familiar with this technique , but for those of you who are n't , do not be alarmed , what you are about to see is considered safe
BORDEN: Great Danton , I must apologize ! I simply had too much magic for my stage at the Pantages !
CUTTER: I do n't see how Borden found him- I had him under wraps , I was careful .
ANGIER: Well , he did . Cutter helps Angier to his feet .
CUTTER: Sit , do you think it might be her ? Olivia ? Angier stops to look at Cutter .
ANGIER: No . I do n't . Cutter gestures at Root .
CUTTER: Shall we cut him down ?
ANGIER: He 's the Great Danton . Let him cut himself down .
OLIVIA: I was expecting you sooner , Robbie . Your message said `` afternoon '' .
ANGIER: Well , it takes a bit for me to get around these days
OLIVIA: What do you mean ? You sent me to- Angier takes her by the shoulders , ROUGHLY .
ANGIER: I sent you to steal his secret- not to improve his act-
OLIVIA: That 's my job- !
ANGIER: Or to fall in love with him !
OLIVIA: You abandoned me to him ! Angier SLAPS her . She shakes her head at him .
CHALLENGING: Yes ? Then how does he do it ? !
OLIVIA: Cutter was right- it 's a double . Angier shakes his head , furious .
ANGIER: Of course Borden said that-
OLIVIA: He did n't say anything- he 'd neve say . I 've seen things- make-up , glasses , wigs . We do n't use any of it for the show , but I 've found it hidden backstage .
SCORN: It 's misdirection- he leaves those things lying around to make you think he 's using a double .
OLIVIA: All the time ? He does n't know when
ANGIER: All the time , Olivia- that 's who he is , that 's what it takes- he lives his act , do n't you see ? !
BEAT: And just because you 're sleeping with him does n't mean he trusts you .
OLIVIA: You thing you can see everything , do n't you ?
ANGIER: You stole it ?
OLIVIA: I borrowed it for tonight . I thought you 'd be able to translate some of it , but now I realize-
ANGIER: I ca n't .
SCORN: You ca n't .
ANGIER: Olivia , no one could-
STUDIES PAGES: It 's a cypher- with a transposition that probably shifts every day of the diary . Even with the keyword it would take months to decode
OLIVIA: And without the keyword ?
ANGIER: Perhaps never . We 'll see .
OLIVIA: No , we won't- if I do n't get that ack tomorrow morning , he 'll know I took it . Angier looks at her , incredulous .
ANGIER: You can ' r possibly think I 'd let this go ? This is his diary , Olivia . All of his secrets are right here , in my hands .
PLEADING: Do n't do this do me , Robert !
SHRUGS: Leave him .
OLIVIA: He knows where I live !
ANGIER: I need to know his method .
DESPERATE: It wo n't get your wife back , Robert .
ANGIER: I do n't care about my wife- I care about his secret !
OLIVIA: He 'll know it was you-
ANGIER: Yes , me , not you . Understand ?
OLIVIA: Robert ? I have fallen in love with him . Angier looks at her , sympathetic .
ANGIER: Then I know how hard this had been hard for you .
BORDEN: Notebook . Fallon nods . Borden sighs . Weary .
CUTTER: I 'll live .
TO COFFIN: You save me the trouble to making you an air hole !
BORDEN: I 'm impressed .
ANGIER: Why 's that ?
BORDEN: You 're finally getting your hands dirty . This is what a good trick costs , Angier . Risk . Sacrifice .
ANGIER: The sacrifice , I 'm afraid , is all going to be yours . Unless you give me what I want .
BORDEN: Which is ?
ANGIER: Your secret . Borden tries to gauge Angier 's expression .
BORDEN: My secret ?
ANGIER: Your method for the Transported Man . Fallon would n't tell me . In fact , he does n't talk at all .
SHRUGS: You have my notebook .
ANGIER: Useless without the keyword .
BORDEN: The keyword is the method .
ANGIER: How fast can you gid ?
CUTTER: Still attached . Did you get you answer ? Angier holds up the folded paper .
ANGIER: Our answer , Cutter . I have n't looked yet , I wanted you to share this . Cutter looks curiously at Angier .
CUTTER: I already know how he does it , Robert . The same way he always has , the same way we do . You just want it to be something more . Angier looks at Cutter , uneasy .
ANGIER: Well , let 's find out , shall we ?
CUTTER: What does it mean ?
EXCITED: It means , Cutter , that we have a journey ahead of us . To America . Cutter watches Angier 's excitement . Awkward .
CUTTER: Robert , listen to me . Obssession is a young man 's game , I ca n't follow you any farther in this .
ANGIER: Then the rest is up to me .
SARAH: I did n't know we 'd be joined fo dinner .
BORDEN: Absolutely . We 're celebrating .
SARAH: Miss Wenscombe . Mr.Fallon .
BORDEN: Champagne . Your finest
SARAH: What are we celebrating , dear ?
BORDEN: Well , we 've hit upon a new trick , have n't we , Fallon ?
OLIVIA: What trick , Freddy ?
BRITTLE: Yes , `` Freddy '' . What trick ?
LOUD: I 'm going to bury myself alive . Every night . Then someone 's going to come along and dig me up !
TO WAITER: I 'm not sure my husband needs-
BORDEN: Who are you to tell me what ? ! Awkward silence . Olivia shifts in her seat .
SARAH: Perhaps , Mr.Fallon , you might escort Miss Wenscombe home . My husband 's eing a bore . I see no reason fo the two of you to suffer as well .
OLIVIA: Good-night , Mrs.Borden . Good-night , Freddy . They leave . Borden glares at his wife .
SARAH: `` Freddy '' ?
BORDEN: It 's my name .
SARAH: Not at home .
BORDEN: I 'm not always at home . Sarah is clearly on the verge of tears .
SARAH: Alfred , why are you being like this ? Borden , seeing her fistress , softnes .
BORDEN: Sarah , I had a terrible ordeal today . I thought I 'd lost something very precious to me .
SARAH: What ?
BORDEN: Secrets are my life , Sarah . Ou life . Sarah brushes away a tear .
SARAH: When you 're like this , Alfred , I 'm not seeing the real you . You 're treating me like your audience . Performing . I ca n't live with that . Borden just sits there . Offering nothing .
ANGIER: I thought I had the place to myself .
MANAGER: Unexpected guests . Not very polite . A lot of questions . At first I thought they might work for the government .
ANGIER: No ?
LOWERS VOICE: Worse . They work for Thomas Edison .
OLIVIA: No . It 's killing him . He 's obssessed with discovering your method . he thinks of nothing else , and takes no pleasure in our success . I 've had enough . There is no future with him . He sent me here to steal you secrets , but I 've actually come to offer you his .
BORDEN: He has no secrets from me . Borden stares at her , unsure .
OLIVIA: No . This is what he told me to tell you . Beat .
BORDEN: I can spot Angier 's methods from the ack of the theatre . What could you possibly have to offer me ?
OLIVIA: You may know he does his tricks ut you ca n't understand why no one can see that yours are better .
QUIETLY: It does .
OLIVIA: Then let people know . You can be so much more then he is . I can show you how . Borden looks into her eyes .
ANGIER: I 've veen played for a fool !
ALLEY: Who by ?
ANGIER: Tesla never made a machine like the one I asked for .
ALLEY: We never said he had .
ANGIER: You let me believe that he had , Alley !
ALLEY: Where ?
ANGIER: In the hotel . I 've every mind to ing them up here myself-
TESLA: That would be unwise , Mr.Angier .
ALLEY: Sir , my cat ? Tesla silences Alley with a tiny GLANCE .
ANGIER: Then why is n't the machine working ? Tesla gives Angier the slightest of smiles .
TESLA: Because exact science , Mr.Angier , is not an exact science . The machine simply does not operate as expected . It needs continued examination .
ANGIER: Where did my top hat go ?
ALLEY: Nowhere .
TESLA: Which is why we need to rey a different material . It may provoke a different result .
ALLEY: You are responsible for whateve happens to this animal , Doctor .
ANGIER: I 'll go . Angier limps after the cat .
ALLEY: I never bothered to check the calibration . The hat never moved .
TESLA: These things never quite work as you expect them to , Mr. Angier . That 's one of the principal beauties of science .
ANGIER: Which one is mine ?
TESLA: They are all your hat , Mr. Angier . Tesla smiles at him .
JESS: Are we going to the zoo this afternoon , daddy ?
BORDEN: Daddy 's got some business this afternoon .
JESS: But you promised .
BORDEN: Did I ? Jess nods at him , solemly .
JESS: That 's you , daddy ?
BORDEN: Daddy has some errands to run . I 'll e back before you know it , so get eady .
SARAH: We each have our vices .
BORDEN: Sarah . Whatever you may think , you only competitions for my affections is my little girl . I love you . I will always love you , and you alone . She looks into his eyes . Fascinated .
SARAH: You mean it today .
BORDEN: Absolutely .
SARAH: That makes it so much harder when you do n't .
BORDEN: More shopping . She does n't like the smell of money , does n't she ? Fallon looks away . Borden tears up the paper .
PLEADING: Help me with her . Try and convince her that I love her . Please .
OLIVIA: What is it . Freddy ?
BORDEN: Please do n't call me that . It 's nothing , just sometimes things seem wrong . Olivia looks at him . Cold .
OLIVIA: Freddy , I 've told you before . When you 're with me , you 're with me . Leave your family at home where they elong .
BORDEN: I 'm trying , Olivia . Please .
OLIVIA: I 'll get dressed . Borden watches her move down the hall .
BORDEN: You trust me ? Then trust Fallon- he protects the things I care about .
MANAGER: We 're sorry to see you go , Mr. Angier .
ANGIER TURNS: I did n't feel it was necessary to tell the other men about the box . Angier stops .
ANGIER: What box ? The manager smiles .
MANAGER: We never use these rooms in the off - season . It 's a shame .
ANGIER: Yes , you , Borden . Sitting there , in your cell , reading my diary . Awaiting your death . For my murder .
OWENS: Lord Caldlow was happy to hear that you 'd reconsidered his offer .
BORDEN: Angier 's journal , the `` gesture of good faith '' ? It 's a fake .
SURPRISED: I assure you it 's not .
BORDEN: It has to be- it refers to events that happened after his death .
OWENS: Clever predictions , I 'm sure . The provenance of the journal is clea and under no doubt . It 's written in Angier own hand , of which we have numerous examples . What makes you think it 's a fake ? Borden looks away , uncomfortable .
BORDEN: It does n't matter .
OWENS: Including the Transported Man ? Lord Caldlow will be very pleased .
BORDEN: No he wo n't . They 're not complete- you only have the Pledge and Turn for each . Owens leafs through the papers , annoyed .
OWENS: Without the Prestige for each trick these are wothless .
BORDEN: You 'll get the rest after you bring my daughter here . Owens looks at Borden .
SARAH: Deny it all you want- I know !
BORDEN: Sarah , it 's not true ! I 've told you Olivia means nothing to me !
SARAH: I 'll go yo her ! I know what you eally are , Alfred !
QUIETLY FIRM: Sarah . You ca n't do that .
SARAH: I ca n't live like this !
ANGRY: What do you want from me ! Sarah pauses . Catches her breath .
QUIET: I want you to be honest with me . No tricks , no lies , no secrets . Borden calms . Looks into her eyes . Nods .
BORDEN: Not today .
WHISPERS: Thank you . Borden watches her turn away from him .
CUTTER: I- I 'm looking for an old friend-
ANGIER: It 's a good to see you , John .
CUTTER: Good rehearsal space . Blind stagehands . I like it-
KNOWING SMILE: You always had an eye for publicity .
ANGIER: I need your help , John . My last show . A limited engagement .
CUTTER: Your last show ?
ANGIER: A wise man once told me that obsession was a young man 's game . I 'm almost done . One thing left The real Transported Man . Cutter stares at the crate .
CUTTER: You want to design a show around it ?
ANGIER: i do n't want you backstage , I need you front of house , managing . Cutter considers this . Uncertain .
CUTTER: What sort of booking are you after ?
ANGIER: The sort that Borden ca n't ignore . Cutter looks at Angier . Nods .
DRIVER: This is the address , sir .
CUTTER: Mr.Ackerman . It 's an honor to see you again , sir . Ackerman shakes Cutter 's hand .
ACKERMAN: When you said you only wanted to show me one trick it piqued my interest .
CUTTER: It 's a very special trick . Mr.Ackerman . Angier has appeared .
ANGIER: Pleased to meet you , Mr. Ackerman .
ACKERMAN: Likewise , I 'm sure . Let 's get on , shall we ? Angier smiles .
CUTTER: Turn it on , please .
ACKERMAN: Very pretty .
ANGIER: Are you interested in helping us ?
NODS: Yes . But you 'll have to dress it up a little . Disguise it . Give them enough reason to doubt it .
SURPRISED: Mr. Ackerman . When they saidI did n't think you 'd be here in person . Ackerman sits without being asked to .
ACKERMAN: I have an act for your venue .
FLUSTERED: Well , of course , sirBut I 'm afraid I 'm booked . The Moscow Ballet . They 're playing through next year .
ACKERMAN: Get rid of them . This is a magical act . An excellent one . I believe you booked his first engagement several years ago . The Great Danton .
MERRIT: You really want me to- Ackerman stands .
SMILES: There will be one hundred performances . No more , no less . Five perfomances a week . No matinees , no weekends .
OLIVIA: You have n't spopken about her , Freddy . Not once .
BORDEN: Who ?
OLIVIA: Do n't be cruel .
BORDEN: Why would I talk about her to you ?
OLIVIA: Because she was part of your life and now she 's gone . Borden says nothing .
LOOKS AWAY: I was such a coward , I could n't bring myself to face her . What would she have said , I wonder ?
SNAPS: You want the truth about me , Olivia ? I never loved Sarah .
APPALLED: You married her , had a child with
BORDEN: Part of me loved her . But part of me did n't . The part that found you . The part that 's sitting here now . I love you . That is the truth that matters . Olivia tosses her napkin on her plate .
OLIVIA: You could be sitting in some othe estaurant talking to some othe woman about me that way . It 's unhuman to be so cold .
BORDEN: He 's back ?
OLIVIA: After two years . And he has a new trick . They 're saying it 's the best that London 's ever seen . Borden can not hide his reaction .
ANGIER: Ladies and gentlemen , my first trick of the evening is one that involves considerable risk . Anyone in the audience who would be irrevocable damaged by seeing a man drown should leave now , for when I tell you that the young lady who taught performing it , you will understand the seriousness of the danger involved .
BORDEN: Why only 100 performances ? Do his methods dictate it , or is it simply a publicity move ? Borden walks back and stares at the sketch .
CUTTER: It 's Cutter .
BLIND STAGEHAND: What do you want ?
CUTTER: I 'm looking for Angier .
ANGIER: You found him . Cutter turns . Angier approaches .
CUTTER: What are they doing ?
ANGIER: Disposing of the Prestige materials .
CUTTER: What 's down there ? Angier looks at him , serious .
ANGIER: Do you really want to know ? Cutter considers Angier 's grave tone .
CUTTER: Perhaps not . Cutter leaves by the stage door .
BORDEN: They do this every night . Afte each performance ?
STAGEHAND: Where 'd you think you 're going ? Borden pulls off his beard .
BORDEN: I 'm part of the act , you fool !
CUTTER: Who was that ?
JUDGE: You will , in one month 's time , be hanged by the neck until dead . May the Lord have mercy on your soul .
OWENS: Mr.Cutter ?
CUTTER TURNS: Owens . They shake hands .
CUTTER: Thank you for coming , Mr.Owens . It 's fallen to me to dispose of Mr.Angier 's equipment . Looking at the manifest , it 's cleat that Lord Caldlow has purchased the bulk of the items .
OWENS: Mr.Cutter , if you needed to know where to deliver the items you surely could have just-
CUTTER: It 's not just that , Mr.Owens . There is a particular item This time , in fact , that I wish to well , that is to say , I want to-
OWENS: You wnat to buy it instead .
CUTTER: I suppose so , yes .
OWENS: This is the machine ?
OFF LOOK: I 'm afraid Lord Caldlow was adamant about procuring this particular item .
CUTTER: Perhaps if I dould talk to Lord Caldlow in person .
OWENS: Out of the question , I 'm afraid .
SARDONIC: Still here , Borden ? Borden looks up .
BORDEN: For now .
SULLEN: Got a visitor . Lord Caldlow . With a little girl . Borden HURRIES to his feet .
BORDEN: Jess , how are you ?
JESS: Can I come in there , Daddy ?
BORDEN: Everything 's going to be okay .
ENGLISH ACCENT: Caldlow . Yes , I am . I always have een . Borden STARES at Angier .
BORDEN: I saw you die . Angier just SMILES .
ANGIER: They flatter you with all those chains , Alfred . Do n't they know you ca n't escape without your little ubber ball ? Borden says nothing .
BORDEN: You were always afraid to get you hands dirty ( looks down at his
JESS: Not anymore .
ANGIER: No . Not anymore . And I win . Because no one cares about the man in the ox , the man who disappears .
BORDEN: You win . But do n't take my little girl Angier looks at Borden . Bitte
ANGIER: I know how hard it is to have someone so precious taken away , do n't I
BORDEN: Wait . Do n't you want this ? You paid for it .
ANGIER: Your secret .
VICTORIOUS: -mine is better . Angier TURNS .
BORDEN: Angier ! Let me say good-bye . Please .
JESS: When are you taking me home , Daddy ?
BORDEN: Soon . I promise . Soon .
ANGIER: For God 's sake , Borden .
BORDEN: Daddy 's coming , I promise . I promise .
HOUSEKEEPER: Come here , love .
TO ANGIER: Sir , there 's gentleman waiting . Angier looks at her , surprised .
CAPTAIN: Dead God .
ANGIER: Hello , Cutter .
CUTTER: You 're alive .
ANGIER NODS: You 're Lord Caldlow . How ?
SHRUGS: I learned an American accent from-
ANGRY: How are you alive , Robert ? ! I saw you on the slab , for God 's sake .
ANGIER: I magician never reveals his secrets .
HOUSEKEEPER: Go on , child . Angier smiles kindly at her .
ANGIER: Good night , Jess . They leave .
CUTTER: Who 's the girl ? Angier says nothing .
QUIET: What have you done ?
ANGIER: She needs looking after-
CUTTER: She needs her father , but you 're letting him hang . And I helped you . Cutter moves to the door . In a daze . Pauses .
ANGIER: You do n't have to . I 'm going to make sure the machine . is never used again .
SHRUGS: A good magician never repeats his tricks .
CUTTER: Then , Lord Caldlow , where would like me to deliver it ?
ANGIER: My theatre . It belongs with the Prestige materials . Cutter lookd at Angier . Sad .
CUTTER: I once told you about the sailor who described drowing to me
NODS: He said it was like going home .
CUTTER: I was lying . He said it was agony . Cutter opens the door . Angier watches him go .
BORDEN: We go alone now- both of us . Only I do n't have as far to go as you . Borden looks down at his feet .
QUIET: Are you watching closely ? Sullen stares back at him , terrified .
CUTTER: Thank-you gents .
WORKMAN: Where do you want it ?
CUTTER: Do n't worry . Someone 's coming to help . The workmen levae . Cutter looks at the crate . Angier emerges from the darkness .
ANGIER: Cautions as ever , Cutter . No one 's going to use the place . I own it .
CUTTER: No room left- you could n't have acommodated 100 performances .
ANGIER: It 's a good thing I retired early then .
CUTTER: I 'll go mix the cement . Cutter looks at Angier , cold .
ANGIER: Cutter , I tried not to involve you .
WHISPER: No one cares about the man in the ox . Behind him , a NOISE .
CALLING: Cutter ? No responses .
WARDEN: Alfred borden , on this day , in the name of the King and the high court of England , you will meet your end . Do you have anything to say fo yourself .
WHISPER: Abacadabra .
WEAK: You- you died . Borden shakes his head .
ANGIER: You were Fallon . The whole time
BORDEN: We were both Fallon . And we were oth Borden . Angier considers this . Minds spinning .
ANGIER: Were you the one who went into the
BORDEN: Simple , maybe . But not easy .
ANGIER: What about Olivia ? And your wife ?
BORDEN: We each loved one of them . We each had half a full life . Enough fo us , but not for them .
VERY QUIET: I 've made sacrificies .
BORDEN: It takes nothing to steal someone else 's work .
ANGIER: It takes everything .
CONFUSED: It did n't work .
HORRIFIED: No , wait ! I 'm the-
WEAKER: Do you want to see what it cost me ? You did n't see where you are , did you ? Let me show you .
SCORN: You went halfway around the world . You spent a fortune . You did terrible things and all of it for nothing .
ANGIER: Nothing ? You never understood , id you ? Why we did this ?
COUGHS: The audience knows the truth- that the world is simple . Miserable . Solid all the way through . But if you could fool them , even for a second , you could make them wonder . Then you got to see something very special You really do n't know ? Borden just stares at Angier . Who smiles .
EDWARD: Left pocket .
VANCE: Look , we 're talking about hard assets and a straight liquidation . We have over a thousand man hours in this deal .
STUCKEY: This is a `` no brainer '' . There 's no risk for you . No one has eve lost money backing Mr. Harris .
EDWARD: It 's unacceptable .
STUCKEY: Hah ! Did you see the look on their faces ?
VANCE: You do n't think we pushed too hard ?
STUCKEY: NO way ! They 'll come back . They ca n't afford not to . Edward , that bluff was beautiful .

EDWARD: Very good . You ought to have that printed up on your business card .
VIVIAN: If you 're making fun of me , I do n't like it .

VIVIAN: No , but it 's getting there .
EDWARD: Vivian , how much to put up with me for the entire night ?
VIVIAN: You could n't afford it . Vivian starts to get out of the car .
EDWARD: Try me . A moment . Vivian 's sexy smile comes on .

VIVIAN: Here we go Edward .
EDWARD: My raincoat 's in the back . Put it on .
VIVIAN: Why ?
EDWARD: You may feel more comfortable . This is not the kind of place that ents rooms by the hour .
VIVIAN: You mean they do n't have hookers .

VIVIAN: There , see ? Now the emblem is ight in the middle of the knot .

VIVIAN: Hey Kit , where do I go for the clothes ? Good stuff on him .
SALESWOMAN: May I help you ?
VIVIAN: I 'm just looking , thanks .
SALESWOMAN: Are you looking for something in particular ?
VIVIAN: Yes . Something conservative .
SALESWOMAN: Yes
VIVIAN: You have beautiful things . How much is this ?
SALESWOMAN: I do n't think it would fit you .
VIVIAN: I did n't ask if it would fit . I asked how much it was .
SALESWOMAN: It 's very expensive .
VIVIAN: What is with you ?
SALESWOMAN: Excuse me ?
VIVIAN: I 'm going to spend money .
SALESWOMAN: I do n't think we have anything for you here . You 're obviously in the wrong place .
MR. THOMAS: May I help you Miss ?
VIVIAN: I 'm just going to my room .

VIVIAN: I 'm I 'm with a friend .
MR. THOMAS: And who is that ?

OPERATOR: She apparently joined him last night . Mr. Thomas waves the Operator away .
MR. THOMAS: Why do n't you come with me . We 'll chat for just a moment .
VIVIAN: Vivian .
MR. THOMAS: Miss Vivian things that go on in other hotels do n't happen at the Regent Beverly Wilshire . Vivian says nothing . MR. THOMAS Mr. Harris , however , is a very special customer . And we like to think of our special customers as friends . As a customer , we would expect Mr. Harris to sign in any additional guests . But as a friend , we 're willing to overlook it , I 'm assuming you 're a relative ? Vivian finds herself nodding . MR. THOMAS I thought so . You must be his ?
VIVIAN: Niece ?
MR. THOMAS: Of course . Naturally when Mr. Harris leaves , I wo n't see you in this hotel again . Vivian bites her lower lip , nods . MR. THOMAS Good . We understand one another . I would also encourage you to dress in a more appropriate manner .
VIVIAN: That 's what I was trying to do .
MR. THOMAS: Women 's clothing . Bridget , please . Vivian is staring at him . MR. THOMAS Bridget , hello , this is Barnard Thomas over at the Regent Beverly Wilshire .

VIVIAN: Barney . She smiles mischievously .
VANCE: Okay this is the jewel in Kross 's crown . We can strip out all the heavy equipment . Some of the cranes are very valuable overseas . The Japanese are salivating for them .
STUCKEY: Prime industrial property straddling the Port of Long Beach and Los Angeles . It gives me a hard-on .
EDWARD: What 's that long building ove there ?
JAKE: Storage , I think .
EDWARD: Not with those smokestacks it 's not .
VANCE: Let me check . Vance pulls out a notebook .
JAKE: The real estate possibilities are endless . Most of the yard we 'll just level . I talked to a couple of developers , under the table , of course , and they said
EDWARD: You what ?
JAKE: I talked to some developers about the land .
STUCKEY: What kind of an idiot are you ? You do n't talk about this to anyone .
JAKE: They 're close friends , they 'd never breathe a word
STUCKEY: Where did you dig this moron up ?
VANCE: He 's right , Jake , that was an incredibly stupid thing to do . It wo n't happen again , Edward . I 'll pull him off the project immediately .
EDWARD: Do n't bother .
STUCKEY: What ! ?
EDWARD: We do n't have the time to bring someone new up to speed . Besides You 've already impressed everyone you need to , have n't you ?
JAKE: It wo n't happen again , Mr. Harris .
VANCE: This is interesting . That uilding is storage now , but it used to be a smelting plant . They closed it down after World Wa
EDWARD: I want our lawyers to check into the toxic waste licences on them ight away . I want to know if the permits are still valid and what kind of limits are on them .
STUCKEY: Jesus , yes . It 's a long shot but if the permits are still in effect , they 're worth a fortune .
EDWARD: What time 's diner tonight ?
STUCKEY: Eight o'clock . Kross is bringing his son . Very bright kid , watch yourself with him . Who 's this girl you 're taking ?

EDWARD: Let 's hope so . You 'll get some more clothes tomorrow . I 'll be pushed for time so meet me in the hotel lobby at seven forty-five sharp . Got it ?
VIVIAN: No , I do n't `` got it '' . Even the farmboys back in Georgia come to the door when they 're taking you on a date .
EDWARD: This is n't a date .
VIVIAN: Go by yourself then . Where you taking me anyway ?
EDWARD: The Rex .
VIVIAN: Any good ?

MR. THOMAS: It 's a bit beyond my range , shall we say .
VIVIAN: Yeah , mine too . Is it like , y'know , normal ?

VIVIAN: Will I like it ?
MR. THOMAS: You 'll like it fine .
VIVIAN: Okay . Thanks , Barney . You 're the best . She turns away .
MR. THOMAS: Just mind which fork you use .
VIVIAN: Fork ?
MR. THOMAS: In fifteen minutes I can teach you everything you need to know to dine with the Queen . First , as you pick up the knife you shift your fork to the left hand .
VIVIAN: But I always eat like this .
MR. THOMAS: Either you 're European or badly ought up .

MR. THOMAS: Actually , some of the richest people I know have the worst manners . Of course , Mr. Harris , eing of old money , knows his way around a table . All right now , pay attention please . Salad fork .
VIVIAN: What if they serve soup ?
MR. THOMAS: They will serve salad .
VIVIAN: But what if they serve soup ?
MR. THOMAS: Then you use your soup spoon .
VIVIAN: I like steak .
MR. THOMAS: Then you would use your
VIVIAN: Steak spoon ! Mr. Thomas swallows his exasperation .
MR. THOMAS: Miss Vivian
VIVIAN: Maybe I 'll just order a burger , Barney , that way I can eat with my hands .
MR. THOMAS: Miss Vivian there 's a salon here in the hotel . Instead of worrying unnecessarily about table manners , why do n't you just have your hair done instead ?
VIVIAN: Professionally ?
THANE: I hate him already . All set ?
VIVIAN: Yeah what a ya say we chop it all off and bleach the tips .
THANE: Darling ? Trust me .
MR. THOMAS: Good evening , Mr. Harris . Edward looks at him blankly .
EDWARD: Of course , yes . If you 'll excuse me just a moment
MR. THOMAS: I have a message for you from you `` niece '' , sir .
EDWARD: My what ?
MR. THOMAS: The young lady staying in you oom ? Edward 's eyes narrow . He hangs up the phone .
EDWARD: I think we both know she 's not my niece . Mr. Thomas looks uncomfortable . EDWARD Does this hotel have any problem with that ?
MR. THOMAS: Mr. Harris , a guest of yours , is a guest of ours and shall be treated accordingly . The young lady asked me to tell you that she is waiting for you in the lounge .
EDWARD: Thank you . He starts towards the lounge .
MR. THOMAS: Very intriguing young woman , Miss Vivian . His tone stops Edward in his tracks . MR. THOMAS Have a good evening , sir .
VIVIAN: You 're late .
EDWARD: I 'm sorry .
VIVIAN: You 're forgiven .
KROSS: So young man , I understand you are trying to take over my company .
EDWARD: Please do n't patronize me , Mr. Kross . Our ages mean nothing here . Kross and David look at each other .
DAVID: Mr. Harris , we know you 've purchased at least twenty percent of our stock . We also know you plan to file a formal bid for a majority share .
EDWARD: Twenty-five percent .
KROSS: Mr. Harris , I built Kross Enterprises myself . I know every man who ever worked there by his first name . I know their wives and their children . If you intention is to take over my company and turn it into a glorified real estate deal , think again .
EDWARD: What do you suggest , Mr. Kross ?
KROSS: What would it take to buy ou stock back ? Name your price .
EDWARD: To get me in a mood to sell double what I paid . But you company does n't have enough capital right now to buy anything .
DAVID: We 're on the verge of closing a large navy contract . Double is ridiculous but we can assure you a healthy profit on you shares . We would give you a promissory note
EDWARD: You 're not getting any navy contracts .
DAVID: There 's no way you could know that .
EDWARD: But I do know . I also know you lines of credit are over-extended . If I do n't buy your company , someone else will Ah , the escargot .
VIVIAN: Scume me , what are these things ?
WAITER: Escargot , mademoiselle .
EDWARD: Snails .
KROSS: You 've got a lot of nerve .
EDWARD: No . What I have is a lot of money .
KROSS: I know all about you , Mr. Harris . When you buy companies , they have a way of disappearing . Even the pension funds are stripped clean . The last three companies you took over were cut up in so many pieces , widows were left without their retirement checks .
EDWARD: What I did with those companies was perfectly legal .
KROSS: I do n't question the legality of what you do . It 's you morality that makes me sick . I will not allow my company to be aped by a man like you .
EDWARD: It is not your company . It 's a public company . And I am going to acquire it . Either I buy from the other stock holders , or I buy from you . Vivian struggles with her escargot . EDWARD I would suggest that you and you oard cooperate with me , rathe than fight a battle you do n't have the ammunition to win .
VIVIAN: Slippery little suckers Kross rises .
KROSS: If you 'll excuse me young lady , Mr. Harris Deal with this , David , you know where we stand . I need to go someplace and puke . He rises . He exits .
DAVID: Men like my father built this country . He was no saint . He screwed people . But for every guy he stepped on , he gave a hundred a good job . Edward is silent .
VIVIAN: He seems like a nice man .
EDWARD: We can reach an understanding on this .
DAVID: I do n't think so . You should know we 're going to fight you with every resource we have .
EDWARD: Do what you have to do . I do n't take it personally .
DAVID: I do . I take it all very personally . Very nice meeting you , Vivian .
EDWARD: And that 's the way the game is played .
VIVIAN: Some game . Screwin ' some poo slob out of his retirement .
WAITER: Are we ready for the next course , sir ?
EDWARD: No . Bring a check , please .
VIVIAN: You 're upset , huh ?
EDWARD: Upset . No . I never get upset about business .
VIVIAN: You liked the guy , though .
EDWARD: Whether I liked him or not is irrelevant . It 's business . There 's no emotion involved in usiness if you want to survive .
VIVIAN: We 're the exactly the same ! Kit keeps telling me do n't get emotional when you turn tricks that 's why no kissing it 's too personal . The key is like you 're saying , stay numb , do n't get involved when I 'm with a guy , I 'm a robot , I just do it . Except with you . At your price I give my all Edward laughs . VIVIAN Let 's not talks about this heavy stuff . Come on , relax .
EDWARD: That is very good .
VIVIAN: Know what we 're gon na do in a little while then ? We 're gon na call Domino 's and have 'm delive a bigass pizza . We 're gon na eat it in bed . We 're gon na veg ' out and watch television .
EDWARD: Television ?
VIVIAN: Yeah , it 's this box , it has pictures , sound . You do n't have to use your brain at all .
EDWARD: I have work to do .
VIVIAN: Uh-uh . No work . Smiling , she softly kisses his throat . VIVIAN See what you have n't figured out yet
EDWARD: I still do n't understand why you only bought one dress .
VIVIAN: I was n't as much fun as I thought it was going to be .
EDWARD: Why not ?
VIVIAN: Well , you know those cold bitches that work in those stores and try to intimidate you ? It works .
EDWARD: Was someone rude to you ?
VIVIAN: I had a little problem in one store . I was n't dressed right . I do n't know what to say . I do n't elong there . Maybe I 'll just go back to Bridget . She was cool .
EDWARD: Vivian , you belong wherever you are . I do n't care how you were dressed , they were the ones who were wrong , not you . Edward sits on the bed . EDWARD People are n't going to respect you unless you respect yourself . The next time someone is rude to you , you stare at them right here .
VIVIAN: Okay .
EDWARD: Good .
VIVIAN: Come with me ?
SALESGIRL: Do do you have a charge account with us ?
VIVIAN: I look like fucking Nancy Reagan .
VANCE: Kross came out of his corne swinging . He started buying up all available stock as soon as the market opened .
EDWARD: He 's a tough old son of a itch
VANCE: It 's up to ten and a quarter .
EDWARD: Offer nine and a half . Bring them back down to earth .
STUCKEY: Goddamit ! Where is he getting the money to fight ?
EDWARD: Someone 's loaning it to him . Get on it right away .
STUCKEY: Our contract guys are working on the Kross pension funds . There 's another forty million there . We can bleed 'm dry .
EDWARD: Put the pension funds on hold until I say otherwise .
STUCKEY: We 're letting them slide ?
EDWARD: I want the treatment plant licenses to be top priority right now .
STUCKEY: But , Edward
EDWARD: Do it .
VIVIAN: Not me !
SALESWOMAN: Is n't this lovely ? I think it would look wonderful on you .
VIVIAN: 'Scume me .
SALESWOMAN: Yes ?
VIVIAN: Do you remember me ?
SALESWOMAN: No , I 'm sorry , I do n't .
VIVIAN: I was in here yesterday .
STUCKEY: You were right . Kross mortgaged everything he has down to his grandson 's college tuition to secure loans from a bank . Not just any bank . One we do business with . Edward just sips his coffee . STUCKEY It goes without saying that you usiness means a great deal more to them than our friend Kross 's . All you have to do is make a call .
EDWARD: Come on , Bill , do n't talk to me about how much money 's involved . It 's my money .
STUCKEY: And some of it 's mine . Edward , his jugular 's exposed . Edward hesitates . Then
EDWARD: Get the bank on the phone for me .
VIVIAN: I thought maybe you 'd like dinner .
EDWARD: Thank you . I would . Nice .
VIVIAN: Wait till you see what I have on underneath .
EDWARD: Please .
VIVIAN: What about dinner ?
EDWARD: Dinner can wait .
VIVIAN: You always been rich ?
EDWARD: No .
VIVIAN: Seems like it . I guess it 's easy to get used to , huh ?
EDWARD: Easier than learning how to be poor . My father 's family was wealthy . When I was young there were cars and houses , private schools , nannies . But then my fathe divorced my mother to marry another woman . And he took his money with him . Silence .
VIVIAN: Keep talkin ' . I like hearin ' .
EDWARD: Not much to tell . I went to public school . Went to university on scholarship . Went to work for an investment firm . In eight years I owned it . My father was chairman of the oard of the third company I eve went after . I swallowed that company and shit out the pieces . One of the pieces was him .
VIVIAN: You still mad at 'm ?
EDWARD: He died a long time ago . She gently rests her head on his back .
WAITER: You have a call . Mr. Harris .
VIVIAN: Hi , baby . I 'll be ready . Bye .
EDWARD: I think it 's exciting .
VIVIAN: What id we run into someone I know ?
EDWARD: I really doubt anyone here frequents Hollywood Boulevard .
VIVIAN: You did . A VOICE calls out .
STUCKEY: Well , well , well
EDWARD: Bill , I 'd like you to meet Vivian .
STUCKEY: Bill Stuckey , Vivian . My wife , Elizabeth .
VIVIAN: Hi .
STUCKEY: Lots of fun people here . Let me get you two some champagne . He moves quickly away .
ELIZABETH STUCKEY: Excuse me .
VIVIAN: Real genuine guy .
EDWARD: He 's good at what he does .
VIVIAN: You could freeze ice on his wife 's ass . She anything like your ex ?
EDWARD: Shall we mingle ?
WOMAN: I simply love your dress , Vivian .
VIVIAN: This old thing ?
WOMAN: Of course , a figure like yours can wear anything . You must work out constantly .
VIVIAN: I lead a very physical life .
OLDER MAN: Are you into running , Vivian ?
VIVIAN: I 'm into walking . I walk a lot .
ANOTHER MAN: You look awfully familiar , Vivian . Have n't we run into one anothe at the spa in La Costa ?
VIVIAN: Well , I do often spa there .
ELIZABETH STUCKEY: Edward , she 's marvelous . Warm and witty and down to earth .
EDWARD: She is , is n't she .
ELIZABETH STUCKEY: So unlike your usuals . Where on earth did you find her ?
A WOMAN: We 're good together . He has to admit it . I 've been just what he wants me to be . I say the ight things , I know the right people , I give wonderful parties . No question , no arguments , no embarrassments . It works for both of us .
VIVIAN: Edward , these women here , I do n't think any of 'm like the guys they 're with . They 're just into it for the money .
EDWARD: I 'm sure that 's true for some of them .
VIVIAN: I thought I was the pro . These women make me feel like an amateur .
EDWARD: Ready to stomp sod ?
DAVID KROSS: Hi .
VIVIAN: Hi . I never thought stomping in grass could be so much fun .
DAVID: I like your hat .
VIVIAN: Huh ? Oh yeah . S'okay ? Uhm how 're business things going .
DAVID: Let 's not talk about it , it 's too depressing . Come on , I 'll show you Thunder .
VIVIAN: Please , we hardly know each other .
DAVID: Thunder 's a horse . Come on .
VIVIAN: No .
DAVID: Hope to be ?
VIVIAN: It 's it 's not like that .
DAVID: I see . Well . Maybe that means you 'd have lunch with me sometime then . Vivian is suddenly silent . She looks away . DAVID I 'm sorry , am I being too forward ?
VIVIAN: You do n't know anything about me .
DAVID: I 'd like to find out . You do n't know anything about me either . That 's why people have lunch . But something holds Vivian back , a feeling .
STUCKEY: Fill me in on this . How 'd you and Vivian meet ?
EDWARD: We just did .
STUCKEY: Come on , you can tell me . I sure would like to know where a guy uns into a girl as attractive as this .
EDWARD: The night I left your house , I was lost . I was looking fo directions .
STUCKEY: And you just happened to run into her . Great . What 's she do ? She work ?
EDWARD: Yes
STUCKEY: Doing what ?
EDWARD: Vivian 's in sales .
STUCKEY: Sales , really ? That 's great . What does she sell ? Edward 's eyes narrow .
EDWARD: Why do you want to know ?
STUCKEY: Hear me out . I 've known you a long time . I see a difference in you this week . Like that tie . I 'm suddenly wondering if this girl 's not the difference . Especially when I see her talking with David Kross .
EDWARD: She met him at dinner last night I like this tie .
STUCKEY: So now they 're best friends ? Edward , this girl appears out of nowhere and now I see her talking to a guy whose company we 're trying to buy . It 's too convenient .
EDWARD: You 're being ridiculous .
STUCKEY: Industrial espionage is not idiculous . Edward , how do you know she has n't attached herself to you so she can bring Kross back information ?
EDWARD: Christ , Bill , she 's not a spy , she 's a hooker . I picked her up off Hollywood Boulevard .
STUCKEY: I swear to God , you are the only millionaire I ever heard of who 'd go looking for a goddam bargain streetwalker ! Edward sees Vivian coming .
EDWARD: Let 's drop it , shall we ?
MAN: Edward ! May we have your opinion on something ?
EDWARD: Excuse me a moment .
STUCKEY: Having a good time , Vivian ?
VIVIAN: Yeah . Thanks .
STUCKEY: All this must be quite a change from Hollywood Boulevard . Vivian looks as if she 's been struck .
VIVIAN: What ?
STUCKEY: It 's okay . Edward told me . You secret 's safe with me . Stuckey runs his hand up her arm . STUCKEY What do you charge , Vivian ? Maybe you and I could get togethe after Edward leaves .
VIVIAN: Yeah . Sure . Why not . Call me at the Regent Beverly Wilshire .
STUCKEY: I just might do that .
EDWARD: You 're awfully quiet . You have n't said a word since the party .
VIVIAN: You asshole ! I ca n't believe what a !
EDWARD: Vivian , what the
VIVIAN: Clean the slut up , take her out , huh ? ! What are you trying to prove ! ? I 'm not a piece of meat for you to offer to your friends !
EDWARD: I do n't know what you 're talking about .
VIVIAN: I 've been with stinking old men who 've made me want to puke but I 've never had anyone make me feel as dirty as you did tonight .
EDWARD: Would you please calm down . Tell me what happened .
VIVIAN: Stuckey ! He wants an `` appointment '' with me after you leave . You my pimp now or did he think that up on his own ? Edward looks guiltily away .
EDWARD: What was I supposed to do ? I told the truth . Why should the truth upset you ? It 's not as if you 're from a convent .
VIVIAN: I want my fucking money . I 'm getting out of here . I do n't want anything more to do with you .
EDWARD: Can we talk about this ? Can you just try to calm down ?
VIVIAN: Your goddamned friend , he thinks the only reason I 'm with you is for the money . A tear falls from Vivian 's eyes .
EDWARD: Vivian
VIVIAN: Pay me ! Before I pick up this chair and smash your face in .
EDWARD: Fine . I 'm only here a couple of more days and I 'm not going to spend them fighting with you .
VIVIAN: Fuck off .
EDWARD: I 'll call you a cab . If you want the clothes , pack them up .
VIVIAN: I 'm not hurt . It does n't hurt you when somebody pisses on you , it just pissed you off .
EDWARD: I really am sorry .
VIVIAN: You hurt me .
EDWARD: I 'll make it up to you .
STUCKEY: This is no time to disappear . We 're in too far .
EDWARD: Bill ? Stop panicking . Kross is n't going anywhere and I do n't need to spend the rest of the day watching his stock go down . I 'll e in the office tomorrow .
STUCKEY: Promise me you 'll read those contracts by then .
EDWARD: Goodbye , Bill . Stuckey stops . He calls after Edward .
STUCKEY: Shit By tomorrow , Edward ! Edward hurries on .
MR. THOMAS: Good afternoon , Mr. Harris .
EDWARD: Afternoon .
VIVIAN: C'mon , Kit
EDWARD: Hmm let 's see no , there 's something missing . He holds up the small case .
VIVIAN: What 's that ?
EDWARD: I do n't want you to get too excited these are on loan however
VIVIAN: Edward , I ca n't .
EDWARD: Shush . Of course you can .
VIVIAN: What if I lose it ?
EDWARD: You wo n't .
VIVIAN: What if someone tries to steal it ?
EDWARD: I 'll guard them and you with my life .
PILOT: Your plane is ready to go , Mr. Harris .
EDWARD: Very good .
VIVIAN: Plane ?
EDWARD: You do n't want to go all the way to San Francisco in a limousine , do you ? I do n't .
VIVIAN: Where are you taking me ! ?
EDWARD: To meet some friends . Rudolpho , a poet Benoit , a landlord Mimi , a flower maker
VIVIAN: Huh ?
EDWARD: The opera .
VIVIAN: I 've never been on a plane efore .
EDWARD: I 'm glad you like it . Now be quiet , I 've really got to read these .
VIVIAN: Being quiet .
EDWARD: Vivian . I 'm paying you to be you . Be you . Have you ? Ever been in love with anyone ?
VIVIAN: You mean , besides Elvis ? I 'm a human being . Sure . Once . First time I ever ran away from home , I got as far as Atlanta . I met this boy . He 'd been with his parents on their way to Chicago . They stopped at a gas station . He went to the john . When he came back they 'd split . We sorta started looking out fo each other . Aw , he was sweet . And boy , was he good looking , y'know , dark hair and eyes . The chicken hawks were on him all the time . He hated that . Sometimes we 'd find a safe place to crash nights and we 'd curl up together and we 'd talk about all these crazy things . The two of us getting married someday . Having kids . Stupid stuff .
EDWARD: What happened to him ? A moment . Vivian shrugs .
VIVIAN: My father found me . Dragged me home . I do n't know why , he neve seemed to like me much when I was there . 'Cept when he was drunk , then he liked me a whole lot . I made it back to Atlanta a yea later . Andy was gone . Silence . Vivian stares out the window .
EDWARD: Some people say that opera is an acquired taste , but I do n't elieve it . You can always tell when someone goes to the opera for the first time . They eithe love it or hate it . Those who love it will always love it ; those who hate it might come to appreciate it , but they 'll neve truly love it .
VIVIAN: If it 's in Italian , how will I know what they 're saying ?
EDWARD: I 'll whisper some of the main parts of the story to you . But you 'll be surprised how much you understand . The music conveys the story more powerfully than any words .
VIVIAN: But do n't they have it in English ?
EDWARD: Vivian , do n't be afraid of what you do n't know . That 's the fun of it . The lights dim .
VIVIAN: Okay . Even if I hate it , I 'm glad you brought me .
EDWARD: What am I ? I am a poet . Not a man of wealth but one rich in dreams . You have come to replace my vanished dreams . I dwell now only in your eyes .
OLDER WOMAN: Did you enjoy the opera , dear ?
VIVIAN: It was so beautiful I just about pissed my pants .
EDWARD: If you 'd gone on about how much you liked it , I 'm not sure I 'd have believed you .
VIVIAN: I more than liked it .
EDWARD: I know . I 'm glad .
VIVIAN: Did you ?
EDWARD: Yes . I 've never enjoyed it more . Thank you .
VIVIAN: Love you
EDWARD: Yes ?
STUCKEY: Did I wake you ?
EDWARD: I 'm up .
STUCKEY: I had to call . I jus got off the phone with James Kross . Get this . He wants to see you . Today .
EDWARD: Why ?
STUCKEY: He would n't say . Edward I think we got him . His nuts are on the block and we got him . You there ?
EDWARD: Give me twenty minutes .
STUCKEY: We 'll be there . Listen , if he 's eally caving in , we 'll go from there down to the office . I want him to commit his stock to us this morning .
VIVIAN: Mmm . Hi . Edward smiles at her softly . And then
EDWARD: Better get dressed . We 're having guests .
VIVIAN: Here . Let me .
EDWARD: One more night and you 're finally id of me .
VIVIAN: Yeah , you 've been pretty tough to take .
EDWARD: I have to go to New York tomorrow . Vivian says nothing . EDWARD But I 'll be back in Los Angeles . Soon . I 'd like to see you again . I thought we could work out something An arrangement . Vivian is silent . EDWARD I 'll get you an apartment , buy you a car
VIVIAN: What else ? You gon na leave some cash by the bed when you pass through town ?
EDWARD: It would n't be like that . I want to get you off the street . You 'll have a different kind of life . What 's wrong with that ?
VIVIAN: I 'm sorry . That 's very sweet , Edward , and I know you mean it She is silent .
EDWARD: Vivian , I 've thought about this a lot . This is the best solution .
VIVIAN: When I was a little girl , my mother locked me in the attic when I was bad , which was pretty often . I 'd stare out the window up there and make believe I was a princess trapped in the tower by the wicked queen . Then suddenly a knight on a white horse with his bright colors flying would ride up . Rescue me from the tower , and then we 'd ride off but never , eve in all the times I had that dream did the knight say , `` Come on baby , I 'll put you up in a great condo . '' She finished his tie .
EDWARD: Vivian , life 's not a fairy tale .
VIVIAN: I know . Hey , do n't mind me . I 'm being stupid . I 'll think about it , okay ? It 's a real good offer for a whore .
EDWARD: I 've never treated you like a whore .
VIVIAN: You just did .
KROSS: Mr. Harris .
EDWARD: How are you , Mr. Kross .
KROSS: Not bad for a man who has n't slept in four nights . I 'll get used to it .
VIVIAN: Hello . Hi .
DAVID: Hello , Vivian .
STUCKEY: Let 's not waste time here , shall we ? Mr. Kross , you said this morning , you wished to speak with Mr. Harris . Mr. Harris is now listening .
KROSS: Yes . I 'm here to tell you that I 've reconsidered my position on your acquisition offer .
EDWARD: Expected offer .
KROSS: Of course , yes . After the expected filing period is over , I 'm going to recommend to the oard that we accept your bid .
EDWARD: You 're making the right decision , sir .
KROSS: I 'll see you on one condition . I 'm not so concerned for me but the people who have worked fo me
STUCKEY: They 'll be taken care of . Wo n't they , Edward ?
KROSS: I 'll sign anything you want then .
STUCKEY: Today . Kross nods tiredly . His voice is very soft .
KROSS: Today .
EDWARD: Excuse me , please ? He heads to the bedroom .
VIVIAN: Hello . Is Kit DeLuca there ? When she comes in will you have her call Vivian Wells at 560-30000 . Yes . Okay . She hangs up as Edward comes in .
EDWARD: What do you mean ?
VIVIAN: Last time I saw him he was this strong guy . Now he 's beaten . And you liked him .
EDWARD: Vivian , I want you to listen to me . The man realized that it would be better for his future and his son 's future , if he cooperated .
VIVIAN: Right .
EDWARD: It 's not your concern . It 's usiness , that 's all .
VIVIAN: Business .
EDWARD: Yes . The man made a business decision .
VIVIAN: It 's all just business to you . Him . Me . Your life . Everything 's business .
EDWARD: It 's what I do for a living . It 's how I make money . Silence .
VIVIAN: Lo ?
MR. THOMAS: Barnard Thomas here . Miss Vivian , I wonder if you might come down to the front desk . There 's someone here to see you .
VIVIAN: Me ?
MR. THOMAS: I 'd send them up , but sadly , I do n't trust the young lady to find you on her own .
KIT: Viv ? Where are you , babe ? The sphincter-police wo n't let me through .
VIVIAN: Yes , I 'm glad you 're clean but I 've been calling and calling .
KIT: Was that you ?
VIVIAN: Who did you think ?
KIT: Carlos . I still owe him two hundred bucks
VIVIAN: Kit , I left that money for you days ago .
KIT: Yeah . I just got it .
VIVIAN: Kit
KIT: Everybody keeps starin ' at me .
VIVIAN: Yeah I know what you mean .
KIT: What do you know ? You look good . All dressed up . You clean up real nice . You sure do n't fit in down on the Boulevard , lookin ' like you do . Not that you ever did anyway .
VIVIAN: You think I fit here where they just about chew your food for you ?
KIT: Where do you fit ? Vivian is silent , then .
VIVIAN: I kissed him , Kit . On the mouth .
KIT: Honey , you 're not supposed to do that .
VIVIAN: I know . I stopped pretending and started liking it with him for real .
KIT: Oh , my god , you mean it was good ?
VIVIAN: It was great .
KIT: Dummy .
VIVIAN: He wants to set me up in a place , give me some money .
KIT: I pray for that .
VIVIAN: All I 'm doing is feeling lousy about it . I do n't know what to do . What do I do , Kit ?
KIT: Go for the bucks .
VIVIAN: I do n't care about bucks . I might love this guy .
KIT: Wow , are you in deep shit . You know he 'll break your heart . Vivian is silent again . KIT I blame myself here . First time I laid eyes on ya ' , I knew you were too complicated to be a whore .
JAKE: Congratulations , sir .
EDWARD: What ?
JAKE: Mr. Kross is just getting off the phone with his stock broker . It 's finished . You 've won . Edward says nothing .
EDWARD: Who indeed
STUCKEY: If we can get these letters of intent out of the way now Mr. Harris and I would like to ask you some questions about you company .
DAVID: Dad , excuse me , but that 's inappropriate . You 're under no obligation to answer any questions at all .
KROSS: Could we at least wait till afte the filing period ?
STUCKEY: Mr. Harris is preparing a bid ased on our speculation of the corporation 's net worth . The price he ultimately pays for you father 's stock will be based on that bid . The more we know , the higher our bid can be .
KROSS: It 's in my best interest to cooperate , David .
DAVID: If he throws himself on you sword , you promise to take care of him and his family , huh ? David stares at him .
STUCKEY: That 's unfair !
DAVID: You bed it is . You 're everything he said you were . Do what you have to do , Dad . Just do n't expect me to watch it .
KROSS: He 's young . He has n't learned how to lose gracefully yet . I 'll sign your papers . And I 'll answe your questions . Whatever you want .
EDWARD: Stop . For just a moment . Mr. Kross , I 'd like to ask you a few questions before you sign . You realize that you 're a target . If you were n't mine , you 'd be someone elses , correct ?
KROSS: Yes .
EDWARD: If you had a reprieve , what would do ?
STUCKEY: I do n't think there 's any sense in
EDWARD: Let him answer .
KROSS: I I would take advantage of it .
EDWARD: How ?
KROSS: I I do n't know . There there was n't time
EDWARD: I suppose you 'd find out soon enough that you have assets you presently do n't seem aware of , would n't you ? The waste processing licenses at that abandoned shipyard of yours , you 'd certainly find out about that . Surprise suddenly flares in Stuckey 's eyes .
STUCKEY: Oh , my god Edward , no !
EDWARD: I suppose you 'd use them as collateral on new loans , would n't you ?
STUCKEY: Have you lost your mind ?
KROSS: Quiet . Would I get the loans ?
EDWARD: This time I imagine you would , yes . Hmm With all this in mind , Mr. Kross , I ca n't logically make a formal id on your company , can I ?
KROSS: You 'd be initiating a financial attle you 'd ultimately lose , Mr. Harris .
EDWARD: You 're very right . I think the est thing we could all do is go home .
STUCKEY: What ! ?
EDWARD: Have a good day , gentlemen . He exits from the room . Stuckey follows .
STUCKEY: Edward , what happened ? What kind of move was that ?
EDWARD: No take the car back to the hotel . I need to walk . He sets off across Century Park East .
STUCKEY: Well , well Hello again . I 'm looking for Edward . Vivian just stares at him .
VIVIAN: Edward 's not back . I thought he was with you .
STUCKEY: No , I 'll just have to wait then , wo n't I ?
VIVIAN: No .
STUCKEY: Do you want to know what he did ? Do you want to know what the crazy son of a bitch did ? He handed the whole thing back to Kross ! On a silver platter . For no eason ! What was he thinking , I mean , what was going through his goddam head ? Why ? What was all that benevolent crap ? What are we going to ecome , a philanthropic foundation ? I 'll probably be the director of several worthwhile charities .
VIVIAN: I think it 's great . Stuckey glares at Vivian .
STUCKEY: I bet . A lousy whore and you 're the gum in a hundred million dollar deal .
VIVIAN: Aw , come on , Bill . It 's just usiness . He looks at her a moment .
STUCKEY: But what do I know , maybe you 're worth it . Come on , show me . Let 's see your act . He grabs her wrist .
VIVIAN: Get out !
STUCKEY: Do n't worry . I 'll pay for it . What a you charge ? Huh ? Twenty , thirty , fifty bucks , maybe ? Are you a fifty dollar whore ?
VIVIAN: Are you crazy ?
STUCKEY: You got a mean streak in you , do n't you . He tries to kiss her again . STUCKEY Is that what he likes about you ? Huh ? Answer me !
EDWARD: I think I broke my hand . You 're fired .
STUCKEY: Edward , we 've been together ten years .
EDWARD: And I do n't like what we 've ecome . I 'll cover any losses you have on this one . Now get out , you asshole !
STUCKEY: All this because of that whore !
EDWARD: Yes .
STUCKEY: Edward , think about what you 're
EDWARD: Well , I did n't plan that !
VIVIAN: Why do guys always know how to hit a woman ? Right across the cheek , wham , so it feels like you eye is gon na explode . What do they do , take you all aside in high school and show you how ? It pisses me off !
EDWARD: Not all men hit . And no one is going to hit you anymore .
VIVIAN: Right . You 're quite the Sir Galahad today , are n't ya ' ? I heard what you did with Kross .
EDWARD: It was a business decision . Vivian looks at him .
VIVIAN: It was good .
EDWARD: It felt good . Edward looks on the bed at her suitcases .
VIVIAN: I 'm leaving . Do n't ya see ? If I stay with you like you want me to , there 'll always be some guy , your friends eve , treatin ' me like that thinkin ' they 're allowed to . What are you gon na do , fight 'm all ? No . I 'll take my money now , please .
EDWARD: Stay with me tonight . Not ecause you 're being paid to . Stay with me because you want to .
VIVIAN: I do . I do want to . That 's why I 'm leaving . That 's what you given me , see ? I know what I want now . I want a guy like you for real . Not ecause you buy me things and give me money . The nicest thing you ever done for me is hold my hand . You gon na give me that ? Edward is silent .
EDWARD: Vivian

MR BINGLEY: Delighted to make your acquaintance .
SIR WILLIAM: And may I introduce Mr Darcy .
SIGNIFICANT LOOK: of Pemberley , in Derbyshire !
ELIZABETH: How do you like it here in Hertfordshire , Mr Bingley ?
MR BINGLEY: Very much .
ELIZABETH: The library at Netherfield , I 've heard , is one of the finest in the country .
MR BINGLEY: Yes , it fills me with guilt .
BINGLEY: Not a good reader , you see . I like being out of doors . I mean , I can read , of
TO DARCY: Your library at Pemberly , Mr Darcy , is astonishingly good .
DARCY: Thank you . It is the work of many generations .
MISS BINGLEY: And then you have added so much to it yourself .
JANE: I wish I read more , but there always seems so many other things to do .
BINGLEY: That 's exactly what I meant . He beams at Jane .
LYDIA: Mama ! The regiment is arriving next week !
KITTY: And will be here for the whole winter ! Mrs Forster told us !
LYDIA: They 're going to be stationed in the village !
MR BINGLEY: May I have the honour ? They leave , to dance .
ELIZABETH: Do you dance Mr Darcy ?
DARCY: Not if I can help it .
LYDIA: officers ! Lots of officers !
KITTY: How will we meet them ?
LYDIA: It 's easy . You just walk up and down in front of them and drop something . Lydia pantomimes the actions for Kitty .
MR BENNET: I have long suspected that we have two of the silliest girls in the county .
MRS BENNET: Oh Mr Bennet ! I remember the time when I liked a red coat myself , and if a smart young colonel with six thousand a yea should want one of my girls I shall not say nay to him .
BINGLEY: Come Darcy , I must have you dance . I hate to see you standing by yourself in this stupid manner .
MR DARCY: You know how I detest it .
MR BINGLEY: Upon my word , I 've never seen so many pretty girls in my life .
DARCY: You are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room .
BINGLEY: Oh , she is the most beautiful creature I ever beheld , but her sister Elizabeth is very agreeable .
DARCY: Perfectly tolerable , I dare say , but not handsome enough to tempt me . Elizabeth 's smile drops .
CHARLOTTE: Ignore him , Lizzie , he is such a disagreeable man it would be a misfortune to be liked by him .
ELIZABETH: Do n't worry . I would not dance with him for half of Derbyshire .
TO LIZZIE: Your friend Miss Lucas is a most amusing young woman .
ELIZABETH: â€¢ Yes ! I adore her .
MRS BENNET: It is a pity she is not more handsome .
ELIZABETH: Mama !
MRS BENNET: But Lizzie will never admit she is plain .
TO BINGLEY: Of course it 's my Jane who 's considered the beauty of the county .
JANE: Oh , Mama , please !
MRS BENNET: When she was only fifteen there was a gentleman so much in love with her that I was sure he would make her an offer . However , he did write her some very pretty verses .
IMPATIENTLY: And so ended their affection . I wonde â€¢ who first discovered the power of poetry in driving away love ?
DARCY: I thought that poetry was the food of love .
ELIZABETH: Of a fine , stout love it may . Everything nourishes what is strong already . But if it is only a thin , slight sort of inclination , I 'm convinced that one good sonnet will starve it away entirely .
DARCY: So what do you recommend , to encourage affection ?
ELIZABETH: Oh dancing , of course . Even if ones partner is barely tolerable .
JANE: Mr Bingley is just what a young man ought to be . Sensible , good humoured -
ELIZABETH: Handsome , conveniently rich -
JANE: You know perfectly well I do not believe marriage should be driven by thoughts of money .
ELIZABETH: I agree entirely , only the deepest love will persuade me into matrimony , which is why I will end up an old maid .
JANE: Do you really believe he liked me , Lizzie ?
ELIZABETH: Jane , he danced with you most of the night .
JANE: I was flattered , I must admit . I did not expect such a compliment .
ELIZABETH: That is one great difference between us . Compliments always take you by surprise . Well , Mr Bingley is certainly very amiable , and I give you leave to like him . You 've liked many a stupider person .
JANE: Lizzie !
ELIZABETH: You 're a great deal too apt to like people in general , you know . All the world is good and agreeable in your eyes .
Â€¢ JANE: Not his friend . I still can not believe what he said about you .
ELIZABETH: Mr Darcy ? I could more easily forgive his vanity had he not wounded mine . But no matter . I doubt we shall ever speak again . She blows out the candle .
MRS BENNET: And then he danced the third with Miss Lucas . Poor thing , it is a shame she is not more handsome . The fourth with a Miss King of little standing . And the fifth again with Jane .
MR BENNET: â€¢ If he 'd had any compassion for me he would have sprained his ankle in the first dance .
MRS BENNET: Oh , Mr Bennet ! Anybody would think the girls looked forward to a grand inheritance .
NOT LISTENING: Kitty , be so kind as to pass the butter .
MRS BENNET: As you well know , Mr Bennet , when you die , which may in fact be very soon , ou girls will be left without a roof ove their head nor a penny to their name .
ELIZABETH: Oh Mother , please ! It 's ten in the morning .
MRS BENNET: Praise the Lord ! We are saved . Mrs Hill gives the letter to Jane .
JANE: It is from Miss Bingley . Mrs Bennet is stopped in her tracks .
PAUSE: Her brother will be dining out .
MRS BENNET: This is most unfortunate .
LYDIA: I did n't think he was so good looking anyway .
JANE: Can I take the carriage ?
MRS BENNET: Certainly not my dear , you will go to Netherfield on horse back .
JANE: Horseback ? !
MRS BENNET: Ah , good
MR BENNET: Good grief , woman . Your skills in the art of match-making are without question .
ELIZABETH: Though I do n't think , mama , you can easonably take credit for making it ain . Let 's hope she has n't caught he death before she gets there .
MR BENNET: Well , my dear , if your daughter does die it will be a comfort to know it was all in pursuit of Mr Bingley .
MRS BENNET: People do not die of colds .
ELIZABETH: Though she might well perish with the shame of having such a mother . Mr Bennet laughs .
MRS BENNET: Nonsense , the horse is with Jane . And the girls took the carriage to town .
ELIZABETH: Then I will walk there . We should not leave Jane alone in her condition .
MRS BENNET: Walk ! You will not be fit to be seen by the time you get there .
MR BENNET: Why the devil not . We could have them all laid up at Netherfield Hall .
ELIZABETH: I will be fit for Jane which is all I care about .
CAROLINE BINGLEY: Apparently , Lady Bathurst is redecorating her ballroom in the French style . A little unpatriotic , do n't you think ?
FOOTMAN: Miss Elizabeth Bennet .
CAROLINE BINGLEY: Good Lord , Miss Bennet . Have you walked here ?
ELIZABETH: I 'm so sorry . How is my sister ?
MORE KINDLY: She 's upstairs .
TO FOOTMAN: Show Miss Bennet the way , Alfred . Lizzie leaves . A beat .
CAROLINE BINGLEY: Goodness , did you see her petticoat ? Six inches deep in mud ! No response .
DARCY: I think her concern for her sister does her credit . A little pause , Caroline recovers .
CAROLINE BINGLEY: Oh yes , its shocking to have a bad cold . I dislike excessively being ill myself .
BINGLEY: Miss Elizabeth ! Oh I 'm so glad to see you A doctor comes out of Jane 's room .
TOGETHER: How is she ?
DOCTOR: A violent cold , but we shall get the etter of it .
ELIZABETH: Jane ! Jane 's face lights up . Elizabeth kisses her .
JANE: Lizzie ! Oh , your face is so cold . They 're eing so kind to me , I feel such a terrible imposition .
ELIZABETH: Do n't worry . I do n't know who is more pleased at your being here , Mama or M Bingley .
BINGLEY: It is a pleasure , I mean not to see he so sick , of course , that 's terrible . I will have a room made up for you . You must be our guest here until Jane ecovers .
CAROLINE BINGLEY: Stay ! ? She is a perfectly sweet girl but save being an excellent walker , there is very little to recommend her .
BINGLEY: I thought she showed remarkable spirit coming all this way .
CAROLINE BINGLEY: The eldest Miss Bennet , as you know , I hold in excessive regard and I wish he well settled . Though I do fear with he families low connections there is little chance of it . Their uncle is in trade , you know , in Cheapside .
BINGLEY: If they had uncles enough to fill all Cheapside it would not make them one jot less agreeable .
MRS BENNET: Well , my dear , its all going according to plan . He 's half in love with he already !
MR BENNET: Who , my sweetest ?
MRS BENNET: Mr Bingley ! And he does n't mind that she has n't a penny , for he has enough for the two of them .
CAROLINE BINGLEY: You write uncommonly fast , Mr Darcy .
MR DARCY: â€¢ You are mistaken . I write rather slowly . Caroline Bingley lingers , annoyingly .
CAROLINE BINGLEY: How many letters you must have occasion to write , Mr Darcy . Letters of business too . How odious I should think them !
DARCY: It is fortunate , then , that they fall to my lot instead of yours .
CAROLINE BINGLEY: Please tell your sister that I long to see her .
DARCY: I have already told her once , by you desire . Lizzie looks across from her book .
CAROLINE BINGLEY: I do dote on her , I was quite in raptures at her beautiful little design for a table .
Â€¢: Perhaps you will give me leave to defe your raptures till I write again . At present I have not enough room to do them justice .
MR BINGLEY: Its amazing , how young ladies have the patience to be so accomplished .
CAROLINE BINGLEY: What do you mean , Charles ?
MR BINGLEY: They all paint tables , and embroide cushions and play the piano . I neve heard of a young lady , but people say she is accomplished .
DARCY: The word is indeed applied too liberally . I can not boast of knowing more than half a dozen women , in all my acquaintance , that are truely accomplished .
ELIZABETH: Goodness ! You must comprehend a great deal in the idea .
DARCY: I do .
CAROLINE BINGLEY: Absolutely . She must have a thorough knowledge of music , singing , drawing , dancing and the modern languages , to deserve the word . And something in he air and manner of walking .
DARCY: And of course she must improve her mind y extensive reading . Elizabeth closes her book .
ELIZABETH: i am no longer surprised at your knowing only six accomplished women . I rathe wonder now at your knowing any .
DARCY: Are you so severe on your own sex ?
ELIZABETH: â€¢ I never saw such a woman . She would certainly be a fearsome thing to behold .
CAROLINE BINGLEY: Miss Bennet , let us take a turn about the oom .
ELIZABETH: And it 's a small kind of accomplishment , I suppose .
CAROLINE BINGLEY: Mr Darcy , will you join us ?
DARCY: You can only have two motives , Miss Bingley , and I would interfere with either .
CAROLINE BINGLEY: What can he mean ?
ELIZABETH: Our surest way of disappointing him will e to ask nothing about it .
TO DARCY: Please tell us !
DARCY: Either you are in each other 's confidence and have secret affairs to discuss , o you are conscious that your figures appear to the greatest advantage by walking . If the first , I should get in your way . If the second , I can admire you â€¢ much better from here .
ELIZABETH: We could always tease him .
CAROLINE BINGLEY: Oh no , Mr Darcy is not to be laughed at !
ELIZABETH: Are you too proud , Mr Darcy ? And would you consider that a fault ?
DARCY: That I could n't say .
ELIZABETH: For we 're trying to find a fault in you .
DARCY: Maybe it 's that I find it hard to forgive the follies and vices of others , or thei offences against myself . My good opinion , once lost , is lost forever .
ELIZABETH: â€¢ Oh dear , I can not tease you about that . What a shame , for I dearly love to laugh .
SMALL SMILE: A family trait I think .
ELIZABETH: Jane , do you think you might feel well enough to leave today ?
BUTLER: A Mrs Bennet , a Miss Bennet , a Miss Bennet and a Miss Bennet , sir .
CAROLINE BINGLEY: Are we to receive every Bennet in the country ?
MRS BENNET: What an excellent room you have sir . Such expensive furnishings . I hope you intend to stay here , Mr Bingley .
BINGLEY: Absolutely I find the country very diverting . Do n't you agree , Darcy ?
DARCY: I find it perfectly adequate even if society is a little less varied than in town .
MRS BENNET: But I assure you there is quite as much going on in the country as there is in the town .
ELIZABETH: Indeed Mania , I think Mr Darcy merely meant there were not such a variety of people to be met in the country as there are in town , which you must acknowledge to be true .
LYDIA: Mr Bingley , is it true that you have promised to hold a ball here at Netherfield ?
BINGLEY: Well
LYDIA: It would be an excellent way to meet new friends . You could invite the militia .
KITTY: Oh do hold a ball .
ELIZABETH: ( trying to stop Bingley being
BAMBOOZLED: Kitty
BINGLEY: When your sister has recovered you shall name the day .
MARY: I think a Ball is a perfectly irrational way to gain new acquaintance . It would be etter if conversation instead of dancing were the order of the day .
CAROLINE BINGLEY: Indeed much more rational but rather less like a ball .
ELIZABETH: Thank you , Mary .
BINGLEY: Please let me show you to Jane , you will find her quite recovered .
JANE: Really , I do n't know how to thank you .
BINGLEY: Really , you 're welcome anytime you feel the least bit poorly .
TO CAROLINE: Thank you for such stimulating company . It has been most instructive .
CAROLINE BINGLEY: Not at all . The pleasure is all mine .
ELIZABETH: Mr Darcy .
DARCY: Miss Bennet .
BINGLEY: Goodbye . Goodbye .
MRS BENNET: What a high and mighty man that Mr Darcy is , quite eaten up with pride .
LYDIA: I ca n't believe it , there must be a thousand of them .
ELIZABETH: Please , drive on .
MR BENNET: I hope , my dear , that you have ordered a good dinner today , because I have reason to expect an addition to our family
Â€¢: party . Mr Bennet holds up the letter .
LIZZIE: â€¢ His name is Mr Collins . He 's the dreaded cousin .
CHARLOTTE: Who 's to inherit ?
LIZZIE: Indeed . Everything , apparently . He may leave us our stays , but even my piano stool belongs to Mr Collins .
CHARLOTTE: When ?
LIZZIE: He can turn us out of the house as soon as he pleases .
CHARLOTTE: But why ?
LIZZIE: Because the estate is entailed to him and not to us poor females .
DEEP BOW: Mr Collins , at your service .
LOOKS AROUND: What a charming house ! So convenient fo the local village . And some very fine pieces , if I 'm not mistaken . A beat . This is hardly tactful .
COLDLY: They are . Jane , Lizzie and Mary enter .
MR COLLINS: Ah , these are your daughters , are they not ?
MR BENNET: We have some more somewhere .
MR COLLINS: I must congratulate you . I have heard much of their beauty , but in this instance fame has fallen short of the truth .
COLLINS: What a superbly featured room and what excellent boiled potatoes . It is many years since I had such an exemplary vegetable . To which of my fair cousins should I compliment the excellence of the cooking ?
MRS BENNET: Mr Collins , we are perfectly able to keep a cook .
COLLINS: Excellent . I am very pleased the estate affords such a living . I am honoured to have , as my patroness , Lady Catherine de Bourg , you have heard of her , I presume ? Mrs Bennet shakes her head .
MR COLLINS: My small rectory abuts her estate , Rosings Park , and she often condescends to drive by my humble abode in her little phaeton and ponies . A pause . Lizzie catches her father 's eye .
MRS BENNET: Does she have any family ?
MR COLLINS: One daughter , the heiress of Rosings and very extensive property . I have often observed to Lady Catherine , that he daughter seemed born to be a duchess fo she has all the superior graces of â€¢ elevated rank .
GRAVELY: How happy for you , Mr Collins , to possess the talent for flattering with delicacy . Mr Collins nods with satisfaction .
ELIZABETH: Do these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the moment or are they the esult of previous study ?
MR COLLINS: They arise chiefly from what is passing at the time , and though I sometimes amuse myself with arranging such little elegant compliments , I always wish to give them as unstudied an air as possible .
ELIZABETH: Believe me , no one would suspect you manners to be practised . The girls look at one another .
COLLINS: After dinner I thought I might read to you all an hour or two . I have with me Fordyce 's sermons which speak eloquently on this point .
TO JANE: Do you know Fordyce 's sermons Miss Bennet ?
COLLINS: Mrs Bennet . You do know I have been estowed by the good grace of Lady Catherine de Bough a parsonage of no mean size .
MRS BENNET: Mr Collins , unfortunately it is incumbent on me to hint that the eldest Miss Bennet is - very soon to be engaged .
COLLINS: Engaged !
MRS BENNET: But Miss Elizabeth next to her in both age and beauty would make anyone an excellent partner . Do not you agree , M Collins ?
COLLINS: Indeed . Indeed . A very agreeable alternative .
ELIZABETH: Oh no !
Â€¢: We 've lost him .
ELIZABETH: Kitty ? Lydia ! She and Jane join them .
LYDIA: We just happened to be looking for some ibbon , did n't we , Kitty ?
KITTY NODS: And we met Mr Wickham .
KITTY: He picked up Lydia 's gloves !
LYDIA: He 's a lieutenant ! Wickham bows .
WICKHAM: I 'm enchanted . Shall we all look at some ibbons together ?
LYDIA: Oh yes !
WICKHAM: Though I must warn you , I have very poo taste .
SMILES: Only a man truly confident of himself would admit that .
WICKHAM: No , it 's true . My rooms in town , decorated , I thought , in the height of â€¢ fashion , have reduced grown men to tears of mirth .
MR WICKHAM: And deny people such pleasure ?
ELIZABETH: So you do n't mind being laughed at ?
MR WICKHAM: Not particularly .
ELIZABETH: It is a somewhat sterile quality , is it not , to be aware of ones importance in the world .
WICKHAM: Especially if , like me , one has none .
LYDIA: Lizzie , please lend me some money !
Â€¢: You already owe me a considerable sum , Liddy .
MR WICKHAM: Allow me to oblige .
ELIZABETH: No ! Please - Mr Wickham ! -
WICKHAM: I know . Fivepence halfpenny !
ELIZABETH: It all adds up .
Â€¢ LYDIA: I 'll pay him back .
WICKHAM: Oh yes . I 'll make sure of that .
ELIZABETH: Will you be stationed here all winter , M Wickham ?
WICKHAM: That depends on what the French have in mind . Of course I look forward to action But on the other hand
JANE: Lizzie - look ! They stop . Jane 's face lights up .
BINGLEY: I was on my way to your house .
JANE: Lydia !
BINGLEY: I was just waiting until your sister was quite well.-
LYDIA: She is ! Elizabeth pays no attention to the following
KITTY: - when , then ?
Â€¢: As soon as they have made the white soup .
LYDIA: Be sure to invite Mr Wickham . Darcy turns and rides off without a word .
JANE: Lydia , you ca n't just say that -
MR BINGLEY: Will you excuse me ladies ? Mr Wickham . Enjoy the day . Elizabeth looks at Wickham , puzzled .
KITTY: Yes , white , they must be white .
LYDIA: White is the only colour to be worn this season .
SIR WILLIAM: So I believe .
COLLINS: - of course , when you understand that Lady Catherine de Bourgh is its proprietor you will realise what an immense compliment that is . Lady Catherine spent eight hundred pounds on a chimney-piece alone .
WICKHAM: Your cousin is blessed with an uncommon capacity for charm . Elizabeth laughs and plays a hand .
LYDIA: Will you be attending the Netherfield all , Mr Wickham ?
WICKHAM: I hope to .
TO ELIZABETH: How long has Mr Darcy been a guest a Netherfield ?
ELIZABETH: About a month . Are you acquainted with , Mr Darcy ?
WICKHAM: Indeed , my fate has been very intimate with that gentleman . I have been connected with his family since infancy .
ELIZABETH: As much as I could ever wish to be . I have spent four days in the same house as him , and I think him very disagreeable .
WICKHAM: I can not pretend to be sorry . Elizabeth blushes .
COLLINS: Miss Elizabeth , I was just saying to Si William what appalling weather we 've been having .
ELIZABETH: I think I shall take a little air .
TO MARY: It seems Mr Wickham has met with universal approval . Though Lizzie looks singularly pleased with him .
MARY: At the moment she has more suitors than sense .
SIR WILLIAM: Now any one for a round of bridge ? Elizabeth ?
Â€¢: Really I need to take some air . Mr Collins makes his way to join Elizabeth .
SIR WILLIAM: Mr Collins ?
COLLINS: Oh , I am not so familiar with the game , Sir William .
SIR WILLIAM: Absolute nonsense . I insist that you join us .
CHARLOTTE: Please , Mr Collins , I 'd be happy if you 'd
ELIZABETH: â€¢ I hope your plans in favor of Meryton will not be affected by your difficult elations with the gentleman we were just speaking of .
WICKHAM: Oh no - it is not for me to be driven away . If he wishes to avoid seeing me , he must go not I . Pause .
ELIZABETH: I must ask you Mr Wickham , what is the manner of your disapproval of Mr Darcy ?
WICKHAM: Do you really want to hear ? Lizzie nods .
ELIZABETH: How so ?
WICKHAM: My father managed his estate . We grew up together , Darcy and I . His father treated me like a second son . Oh he was the kindest of men and bequeathed me the best living in his gift , for I had my heart set on joining the church . But when he died Darcy ignored his wishes and gave the living to another man .
LIZZIE: Why did he do that ?
WICKHAM: Out of jealousy , for his father loved me more than he loved him .
LIZZIE: How cruel ! Are you sure ?
NODS: And out of pride , for he considered me too lowly to be worth his consideration .
LYDIA: Aggghh !
KITTY: Breathe in !
HORRIFIED: - I still think there must have been a misunderstanding .
EXASPERATED LAUGH: Oh Jane , do you never think ill of anybody ?
JANE: 0 How could Mr Darcy do such a thing ? I will discover the truth from Mr Bingley at the ball this evening .
ELIZABETH: If it is not true let Mr Darcy contradict it himself . But until he does , I hope never to encounter him .
JANE: Poor , unfortunate Mr Wickham .
ELIZABETH: On the contrary , he is twice the man Darcy is .
JANE: And lets hope for you a rather more willing dancer .
BINGLEY: You 're here ! I 'm so pleased .
JANE: And so am I .
BINGLEY: How are you , Miss Elizabeth ?
ELIZABETH: â€¢ No , no not at all . Admiring the splendo of the ball .
JANE: It is lovely , Mr Bingley .
MRS BENNET: ( refering to Jane and
BINGLEY: I dare say I have never met a more pleasant gentleman in all my years . Look how he dotes on her ! Still Jane has always done what is best for her family .
Â€¢: Have you seen Mr Wickham . She shakes her head .
CHARLOTTE: Perhaps he is in the ballroom .
JANE: He 's not here . Apparently otherwise detained .
ELIZABETH: Detained ?
COLLINS: There you are .
Â€¢ ELIZABETH: Mr Collins . What a pleasant surprise .
MR COLLINS: Perhaps you will do me the honour , Miss Elizabeth ?
ELIZABETH: Oh . I did n't think you danced , M Collins .
MR COLLINS: I do not consider it incompatible with the office of a clergyman to indulge in such an innocent diversion . Elizabeth tries to smile , politely .
COLLINS: â€¢ To be sure , dancing is of little consequence to me , but it does afford the opportunity to lavish'ones partner with delicate attentions which is my primary object of the evening .
JANE: Apparently Your Mr Wickham has been called on some business to town , though my informer told me he would have been less inclined to be engaged had it not een for the presence at Netherfield of a certain gentleman .
ELIZABETH: That gentleman barely warrants the name . The dance leads Elizabeth back to Mr Collins .
DARCY: May I have the next dance , Miss Elizabeth . Elizabeth is stunned .
ELIZABETH: You may . Darcy walks away .
CHARLOTTE: I dare say you will find him very agreeable , Lizzie .
Â€¢ ELIZABETH: Heaven forbid ! That would be the greatest misfortune of all - to find a man agreeable whom one is determined to hate !
ELIZABETH: I do love a Sarabande .
DARCY: Indeed . Most invigorating . They continue , for a moment , in silence .
ELIZABETH: It is your turn to say something , M Darcy - I talked about the dance , now you ought to remark on the size of the room or the number of couples .
DARCY: I am perfectly happy to oblige , please advise me of what you would like most to â€¢ hear .
ELIZABETH: That reply will do for the present . Perhaps by and bye I may observe that private balls are much pleasanter than public ones . But for now we may be silent .
DARCY: Do you talk as a rule while dancing ?
ELIZABETH: We are each of an unsocial , taciturn disposition , unwilling to speak , unless we expect to say something that will - amaze the whole room , and be handed down to posterity with all the eclat of a proverb . So a little lubrication to avoid embarrassment might be advantageous .
DARCY: I see no striking resemblance of your own character in this , how near it is to mine I can not say . Tell me do you and your sisters very often walk to Meryton ?
ELIZABETH: Very mild weather we 've been having .
DANCING PARTNER: Sorry .
ELIZABETH: Yes , we often walk to Meryton - it is a great opportunity to meet new people . In fact when you met us we had just had the pleasure of forming a new acquaintance .
DARCY: I will admit your Mr Wickham is blessed with such happy manners as may ensure his making friends - whether he is capable of etaining them is less certain .
ELIZABETH: He has been so unlucky as to lose you friendship . I remember hearing you once say that your resentment once created was unappeasable . You are very cautious , I suppose , as to its being created ?
DARCY: I am . May I ask to what these questions tend .
ELIZABETH: To make out your character , Mr Darcy .
DARCY: And what have you discovered ?
ELIZABETH: very little . The dancefinishes .
DARCY: I hope to afford you more clarity in the â€¢ future .
CAROLINE BINGLEY: Miss Elizabeth . Let me recommend you as a friend not to give too much confidence to all of the assertions your friend M Wickham might make . He is indeed a charming man , but one should never forget from where he is descended .
ELIZABETH: His lack of trustworthiness and descent appear by your account to be the same thing ,
CAROLINE BINGLEY: Please excuse my interterence , it was kindly meant . â€¢ A breathless Mr Collins appears .
COLLINS: Is that Mr Darcy , of Pemberley in Derbyshire ?
ELIZABETH: I believe so .
COLLINS: But I must make myself known to him immediately !
ELIZABETH: But sir -
COLLINS: He is the nephew of my esteemed patroness , Lady Catherine .
SURPRISED: He is ?
Â€¢ ELIZABETH: Please , Mr Collins ! He 'll consider it an
CAROLINE BINGLEY: What interesting relatives you have , Miss Bennet . Elizabeth walks away into another room .
ELIZABETH: Are n't you going to do something ?
Â€¢: Mr Bennet walks over to the piano .
MR BENNET: Mary dear , you 've delighted us long enough .
MARY: But they asked for another song . Mr Bennet shuts the lid .
MR BENNET: Let the other young ladies have a turn .
ELIZABETH: Perhaps my family have made a competition to see who can expose themselves to the most ridicule .
CHARLOTTE: Well , at least Bingley has not noticed .
ELIZABETH: â€¢ Yes . I think he likes her very much .
CHARLOTTE: But does she like him ? There are few of us who are secure enough to be really in love without proper encouragement . Bingley likes her enormously but might not do more if she does not help him on .
ELIZABETH: She is just shy and modest . If he does not perceive her regard he is a fool .
CHARLOTTE: We are all fools in love . He does not know her character as we do . She should move fast . Snap him up . There is plenty of time for us to get to know them afte we 're married -
MRS BENNET: I have never had such a good time in my life . Mr Bingley you must have such a all once a month at least .
ELIZABETH: Mother . I really think it is time to go .
MRS BENNET: Do n't be impertinent . our hosts are perfectly happy with our company , are you not , Mr Bingley ? I hope I can entice you to Longbourn to sample our hospitality . We would make sure you had 3 or 4 courses at least .
ELIZABETH: Really . This is enough .
MRS BENNET: Allowing for new carriages , dresses etcetera , etcetera . We will be having a wedding here at Netherfield in less than three months , if you ask me . Mr Bennet ? Mr Bennet ! 5o INT . BREAKFAST ROOM - LONGBOURNE - DAY . 50
ELIZABETH: Wait . I beg you . Mr Collins can have nothing to say to me.that anybody need not hear .
MRS BENNET: No . Nonsense , Lizzy . I desire you-will stay where you are . Everyone else , to the drawing room . Mr Bennet .
MR COLLINS: Dear Miss Elizabeth , you can hardly doubt the purpose of my discourse . My attentions have been too marked to be mistaken . Almost as soon as I entered the house I singled you out as the companion of my future life . Elizabeth stares at him , astonished .
MR COLLINS: My object in coming to Longbourn was to choose such a one from amongst M Bennet 's daughters , for as you know I am next in the entail of the estate and such an alliance will surely make amends fo this . And now nothing remains for me but to assure you in the most animated language of the violence of my affections .
ELIZABETH: Mr Collins -
MR COLLINS: And that no reproach on the subject of fortune will cross my lips once we are â€¢ married .
ELIZABETH: You are too hasty , sir ! You forget that I have made no answer .
UNPERTURBED: I must add , that Lady Catherine will thoroughly approve , when I speak to he of your modesty , economy and othe amiable qualities .
ELIZABETH: Sir , I am honoured by your proposal , but egret I must decline it .
MR COLLINS: ( momentarily taken aback , but
RECOVERING: I know ladies have their pretty little ways , and do n't seek to seem too eager -
ELIZABETH: Mr Collins , I am perfectly serious . You could not make me happy and I 'm convinced I 'm the last woman in the world who could make you happy .
PAUSE: I 'flatter myself , cousin , that you efusal is merely a natural delicacy . Besides , you should take into account that despite your manifold attractions it is by no means certain that another offe of marriage may ever be made to you -
ELIZABETH: Mr Collins -
MR COLLINS: So I must conclude that you simply seek to increase my love by suspense , according to the usual practice of elegant females .
ELIZABETH: Sir ! I am not the sort of female to torment a respectable man . Please understand me - I can not accept you !
MRS BENNET: Declined indeed ! The headstrong , foolish
COLLINS: Thank you , but Head strong ?
MRS BENNET: - we shall have this little hiccup dealt with immediately , Mr Collins .
Â€¢: Mr Bennet starter at Mrs Bennet blankley .
MRS BENNET: Mr Collins , Mr Collins has proposed to Lizzie . But Lizzy declares she will not have him , and now the danger is M Collins may not have Lizzy .
MR BENNET: And what am I to do ? Mrs Bennet drags Mr Bennet to his feet .
MRS BENNET: Speak to Lizzy . They march to find Elizabeth .
Â€¢ LIZZIE: Papa , please - ' .
MRS BENNET: You will have this house !
LIZZIE: I ca n't marry him !
MRS BENNET: You 'll save your sisters from destitution !
LIZZIE: I ca n't ! -
MRS BENNET: Go back now and say you 've changed you mind !
LIZZIE: No !
MRS BENNET: Think of your family !
LIZZIE: You ca n't make me !
MRS BENNET: Mr Bennet , say something !
TO LIZZIE: So , your mother insists on you marrying Mr Collins.-
MRS BENNET: Yes , or I shall never see her again ?
MR BENNET: Well , Lizzie . From this day on you must e a stranger to one of your parents -
TO LIZZIE: - who will maintain you when your fathe is dead ?
MR BENNET: Your mother will never see you again if you do not marry Mr Collins , and I will never see you again if you do .
ELIZABETH: Thank you , papa .
MRS BENNET: Oh , ungrateful child ! I shall never speak to her again ! Not that I have much pleasure in talking to anybody . People who suffer as I do from nervous complaints can have no inclination fo talking . Nobody can tell what I suffer
ELIZABETH: What 's wrong , Jane ?
DISTANT: But it is always so . Those who complain are never pitied
ELIZABETH: I do n't understand . What would take him from Netherfield ? Why would he not know when he was to return ?
JANE: â€¢ I have no reserves from you . Jane passes Elizabeth the letter .
ELIZABETH: `` Mr Darcy is impatient to see his siste and we are scarcely less eager to meet her again . I really do not think Georgina Darcy has her equal for beauty , elegance and accomplishments , so much so I must hope to hereafter call her my sister . It is my duty to indulge you in no hope in this respect for your own self . ''
JANE: Is that not clear enough ?
ELIZABETH: Miss Bingley sees that her brother is in love with you and is gone with him to persuade him otherwise .
JANE: But I know her to be incapable of wilfully deceiving anyone .
ELIZABETH: â€¢ He loves you , Jane . Do not give up . Go to our aunt and uncle 's in London .
MRS BENNET: Give my love to my sister . And try not to e so much of a burden , dear .
MR BENNET: Poor Jane . However , a girl likes to be crossed in love now and then . It gives her something to think of , and a sort of distinction among her companions .
DRYLY: I 'm sure that will cheer her up , Papa .
MR BENNET: It 's your turn now , Lizzie . Since you 've turned down Mr Collins you 're free to go off and be jilted yourself . What about M Wickham ? He is a pleasant fellow and would do the job credibly .
ELIZABETH: Thank you , but a less agreeable man would satisfy me . We must not all expect Jane 's good fortune .
MR KENNET: Still , it 's a comfort to know that whatever might befall you , you have an affectionate mother who will be sure to make the most of it . A small smile from Elizabeth .
CHARLOTTE: My dear Elizabeth , I 've come here to tell you the news .
ELIZABETH: â€¢ What news ?
DEFIANTLY: Mr Collins and I are engaged to be married . A stunned pause .
ELIZABETH: Engaged ?
TIMIDLY: You do n't mind , do you ?
ELIZABETH: No , no Of course not .
CHARLOTTE: He asked for my hand this morning .and I accepted him .
WEAKLY: No
CHARLOTTE: I 'm not a romantic , you know . I ask only a comfortable home , and considering M Collin 's character , and situation in life , I am convinced that my chance of happiness with him is as fair as most people can hope for .
ELIZABETH: And that 's all you expect ?
CHARLOTTE: For women in our situation , what choice is there ?
PASSIONATELY: Do n't speak like that , Charlotte !
CHARLOTTE: â€¢ - to become an old maid , at best tolerated , at worst a burden , dependent on the kindness of others ? Or to seek the protection of marriage .
ELIZABETH: And we only have two choices ?
CHARLOTTE: Yes .
ELIZABETH: You can still change your mind , Charlotte .
CHARLOTTE: I 'm twenty-seven years old . We hear the sound of the militia drums
LYDIA: It 's too dreadful ! They 're leaving fo Brighton .
ELIZABETH: All of them ?
KITTY: They got the call this morning .
LYDIA: Not a word of warning !
POSTMASTER: Bad news , Miss ?
ELIZABETH: It could not be worse . I have been invited to possibly the very last place on earth I would like to go .
MR COLLINS: Welcome to our humble abode
CHARLOTTE: My dear , I think our guest is tired afte her journey . Come on , Lizzie , let 's get some tea .
MR COLLINS: â€¢ My wife encourages me to spend as much time in the garden as possible , for the sake of my health .
CHARLOTTE: â€¢ We shall not be disturbed here , for this parlour is for my own particular use .
A BEAT: Oh Lizzie , it 's such a pleasure , to run my own home ! A flash of understanding between them .
ALARMED: What 's happened ?
JUMPS UP: Has the pig escaped ?
CHARLOTTE: Its all right . Its just Lady Catherine .
ELIZABETH: I have not heard from Mr Wickham since the regiment left for Brighton , but I am informed by Lydia who keeps a breast of all matters military that he does very well .
CHARLOTTE: Oh Lizzie .
COLLINS: One of the most extraordinary sights in all Europe , is it not . The glazing alone cost upwards of twenty thousand pounds .
COLLINS: This way !
MR COLLINS: Your Ladyship . Miss de Bourg .
LADY CATHERINE: So you are Elizabeth Bennet .
ELIZABETH: I am , your ladyship .
LADY CATHERINE: Hmm . This is my daughter .
EAGERLY: It 's very kind of you to ask us to dine , Lady Catherine . Lady Catherine ignores her .
MR COLLINS: The chimneypiece alone cost Â£400 .
ELIZABETH: â€¢ Mr Darcy ! What are you doing here ?
MR COLLINS: Mr Darcy ! I had no idea we would have the honour
BOWS: Miss BennetI 'm staying here .
SURPRISED: You know my nephew ?
ELIZABETH: Yes , madam , I had the pleasure of meeting him in Hertfordshire .
FITZWILLIAM: â€¢ Colonel Fitzwilliam . How do you do ?
WHISPERING: You know Mr Darcy is as good as engaged to Miss de Bourg ?
ELIZABETH: Really ? Miss Bingley will be disappointed to hear that . What a sickly , cross little thing ! Oh yes , they should suit each other very well .
LADY CATHERINE: You sit there and you sit there . M Collins ! You ca n't sit next to your wife !
MR DARCY: I trust your family is in good health , Miss Bennet ?
ELIZABETH: They are , thank you .
PAUSE: My eldest sister is currently in London , perhaps you happened to see her there ?
AWKWARD PAUSE: I have n't been fortunate enough , no .
LADY CATHERINE: Do you play the pianoforte , Miss Bennet ?
ELIZABETH: A little , ma'am , and very poorly .
LADY CATHERINE: Oh . Do you draw ?
ELIZABETH: No , not at all .
LADY CATHERINE: Your sisters , do they draw ?
ELIZABETH: Not one .
LADY CATHERINE: That is very strange . But I suppose you had no opportunity . Your mother should have taken you to town every spring fo the benefit of the masters .
ELIZABETH: My mother would have no objection but my father hates London .
LADY CATHERINE: â€¢ Has your governess left you ?
ELIZABETH: We never had a governess .
LADY CATHERINE: No governess ? Five daughters brought up at home without a governess , I neve heard such a thing ! Your mother must have een quite a slave to your education .
ELIZABETH: Not at all , Lady Catherine .
LADY CATHERINE: Mmmm . Are any of your younger sisters out ?
ELIZABETH: Yes , ma'am . All .
LADY CATHERINE: All ! What , five out at once ? Very odd ! â€¢ And you only the second - the younge ones out before the elders are married ! Your youngest sisters must be very young .
ELIZABETH: Yes , my youngest is not sixteen . But I think it would be very hard on younge sisters , not to have their share of amusement because the elder is still unmarried . And to be kept back on such a motive ! It would hardly encourage sisterly affection .
LADY CATHERINE: Upon my word , you give your opinion very decidedly for so young a person . Pray , what is your age ?
SMILES: With three younger sisters grown up , you Ladyship can hardly expect me to own to
P C: it .
LADY CATHERINE: Come , Miss Bennet , and play for us !
ELIZABETH: No , I beg you -
LADY CATHERINE: For music is my delight . In fact there are few people in England who have more true enjoyment of music than myself , o etter natural taste . If I had eve learnt , I should have been a great proficient .
INDICATES DAUGHTER: So would Anne , if her health would have allowed her .
ELIZABETH: Please , I told you I play poorly -
HISSES: Come come , Elizabeth , her ladyship demands it !
LADY CATHERINE: How does Georgina get along , Darcy ?
DARCY: She plays very well .
LADY CATHERINE: I hope she practises . No excellence can e acquired without constant practice . I have told Mrs Collins this . Though you have no instrument of your own you are very welcome to come to Rosings and play on the piano in the housekeeper 's room .
CHARLOTTE: Thank you , your ladyship .
LADY CATHERINE: â€¢ You would be in nobody 's way '' , you know , in that part of the house .
ELIZABETH: You mean to frighten me , Mr Darcy , by coming in all your state to hear me , but I wo n't be alarmed even though you sister does play so well .
DARCY: I am well enough acquainted with you , Miss Bennet , to know I can not alarm you even should I wish it .
INDICATING DARCY: What was my friend like , in Hertfordshire ?
ELIZABETH: â€¢ You really care to know ? The colonel nods .
STOPS PLAYING: The first time I saw him , at the Assembly , he danced with nobody at all - even though gentlemen were scarce and there was more than one young lady who was sitting down without a partner .
COLOURING: I knew nobody beyond my own party .
SMILES SWEETLY: True , and nobody can be introduced in a allroom .
LADY CATHERINE: Fitzwilliam ! Come here and talk to us !
DARCY: I do not have the talent of conversing easily with people I have never met efore .
ELIZABETH: Maybe you should take your aunt 's advice and practice .
ASTONISHED: Mr Darcy ! An awkward pause .
ELIZABETH: Please , do be seated .
PAUSE: I 'm afraid Mr and Mrs Collins are gone on usiness to the village .
DARCY: This is a charming house . I believe my aunt did a great deal to it when M Collins first arrived .
ELIZABETH: I believe so and she could not have estowed her kindness on a more grateful
DARCY: Mr Collins seems very fortunate in his choice of wife .
ELIZABETH: He is indeed lucky to have found one of the few sensible women who would have accepted him . Darcy sits down .
DARCY: No . Thankyou .
CHARLOTTE: What on earth have you done to poor M Darcy ?
ELIZABETH: How long do you plan to stay in Kent , Colonel ?
FITZWILLIAM: As long as Darcy chooses . I am at his disposal .
ELIZABETH: I do imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly to have someone to orde around . I wonder he does not marry and secure a lasting convenience of that kind .
FITZWILLIAM: She would be a lucky woman .
ELIZABETH: Really ?
FITZWILLIAM: Darcy is a most loyal companion . From what I heard , on our journey here , he ecently came to the rescue of one of his friends just in time .
ELIZABETH: What happened ?
FITZWILLIAM: He saved the man from an imprudent marriage .
FALTERING SLIGHTLY: Who was the man ?
FITZWILLIAM: His closest friend . Mr Bingley . A silence .
ELIZABETH: Did Mr Darcy give you his reasons fo this interference ?
FITZWILLIAM: There were apparently strong objections to the lady .
ELIZABETH: What kind of objections ? Her lack of fortune ?
FITZWILLIAM: I think it was her family that was considered unsuitable .
ELIZABETH: So he separated them ?
FITZWILLIAM: I believe so . I know nothing else .
ELIZABETH: I wish Mr Darcy and all his friends well in finding partners suitable to thei very high standards . Good morning , Col. Fitzwilliam .
DARCY: Miss Bennet , I have struggled in vain but I can bear it no longer . The past months have been a torment
ELIZABETH: â€¢ Me ?
DARCY: â€¢ I 've fought against my better judgement , my family 's expectation
PAUSE: The inferiority of your birth.. .my rank and circumstance
STUMBLINGLY: all those things.. .but I 'm willing to put them aside and ask you to end my agony
ELIZABETH: I do n't understand
WITH PASSION: I love you . Most ardently . Elizabeth stares at him .
DARCY: Please do me the honour of accepting my hand .
VOICE SHAKING: Sir , I appreciate the struggle you have een through , and I am very sorry to have caused you pain . Believe me , it was unconsciously done .
STARES: Is this your reply ?
ELIZABETH: Yes , sir .
DARCY: Are you laughing at me ?
ELIZABETH: No ?
DARCY: Are you rejecting me ?
PAUSE: I 'm sure that the feelings which , as you 've told me , have hindered you egard , will help you in overcoming it .
DARCY: Might I ask why , with so little endeavou at civility , I am thus repulsed ?
ELIZABETH: I might as well enquire why , with so . evident a design of insulting me , you chose to tell me that you liked me against your better judgement . If I was uncivil , that was some excuse -
DARCY: Believe me , I did n't mean -
ELIZABETH: But I have other reasons , you know I have !
DARCY: What reasons ?
ELIZABETH: Do you think that anything might tempt me to accept the man who has ruined , perhaps for ever , the happiness of a most beloved sister ?
DARCY: I do not deny it .
BLURTS OUT: How could you do it ?
DARCY: Because I believed your siste indifferent to him .
ELIZABETH: â€¢ Indifferent ?
DARCY: â€¢ I watched them most carefully , and ealized his attachment was much deepe than hers .
ELIZABETH: That 's because she 's shy !
DARCY: Bingley too is modest , and was persuaded that she did n't feel strongly for him .
ELIZABETH: Because you suggested it !
DARCY: I did it for his own good .
ELIZABETH: My sister hardly shows her true feelings to me ! I suppose you suspect that his fortune had some bearing on the matter ?
SHARPLY: No ! I would n't do your sister the
Â€¢: dishonour . Though it was suggested -
ELIZABETH: What was ?
DARCY: It was made perfectly clear that-an advantageous marriage
ELIZABETH: Did my sister give that impression ?
DARCY: There was , however , I have to admit the matter of your family -
ELIZABETH: Our want of connection ? Mr Bingley did n't vex himself about that !
DARCY: No , it was more than that .
ELIZABETH: How , sir ?
DARCY: It pains me to say this , but it was the lack of propriety shown by your mother , your three younger sisters - even , on occasion , your father . Forgive me .
ELIZABETH: And what about Mr Wickham ?
DARCY: Mr Wickham ?
ELIZABETH: What excuse can you give for you ehavior to him ?
DARCY: You take an eager interest in that gentleman 's concerns !
ELIZABETH: He told me of his misfortunes .
DARCY: Oh yes , his misfortunes have been very great indeed !
ELIZABETH: You have ruined his chances , and yet treat him with sarcasm ?
DARCY: So this is your opinion of me ! Thank you for explaining so fully . Perhaps these offences might have been overlooked , if your pride had not been hurt -
ELIZABETH: My pride ?
DARCY: - by my honesty in admitting scruples about our relationship .
ELIZABETH: And those are the words of a gentleman ? From the first moment I met you , you arrogance and conceit , your selfish distain of the feelings of others , made me realize that you were the last man in the world I could ever be prevailed upon to marry .
DARCY: Forgive me , madam , for taking up so much of your time . He leaves , abruptly .
CHARLOTTE: Elizabeth !
ELIZABETH: I was caught somewhat off-guard .
CHARLOTTE: Shall I call the doctor ?
ELIZABETH: No ! Charlotte , I shall be quite all ight . Please , give Lady de Bourgh my apologies . You must not keep her waiting . Mr Collins clatters up the stairs .
COLLINS: ( popping his head around the
DOOR: Come on . We shall be late !
DARCY: I came to leave you this .
Â€¢: preferred your eldest sister . I observed my friend 's behaviour attentively and I could perceive that his partiality fo Miss Bennet was beyond what I have eve witnessed in him .
CONT'D: This I did , though by now I had some doubts about his character . These were confirmed by reports that he had sunk into a life of idleness , gambling and dissipation . The money was soon used up , whereupon he wrote demanding more money which I refused , whereupon he severed all
Â€¢: cousin Fitzwilliam .
CHARLOTTE: Lizzy Are you alright ?
ELIZABETH: I do not know . I hardly know myself . Elizabeth looks at Charlotte utterly shaken .
MRS GARDINER: How fortunate , you are here just in time to catch everybody coming through from Longbourn .
ELIZABETH: How is Jane ? Mrs Gardiner smiles sadly .
MRS GARDINER: She is outside .
JANE: I am quite over him , Lizzie . If he passed in the street I would hardly notice . London is so diverting
ELIZABETH: oh Jane
JANE: Its true ! What with the theatre and But tell me , what news from Kent ?
ELIZABETH: Nothing . Everything as you might imagine .
KITTY: Lizzie , tell mama , tell her !
Â€¢: Mrs Forster has invited me .
WAILS: Why did n't she ask me as well ?
ELIZABETH: Kitty , what 's happened ?
LYDIA: - because she likes me better .
KITTY: I 've just as much right as Lydia -
MRS BENNET: Oh , if I could but go to Brighton -
KITTY: - and more so , because I 'm two years older ! Elizabeth looks to Jane .
JANE: Lydia has been invited to Brighton with the Foresters .
MRS BENNET: â€¢ A little sea-bathing would set me up very
LYDIA: I shall dine with the officers every night ! An anguished wail from Kitty .
MRS BENNET: I 'm sure I cried for two days when Colonel Millar 's regiment went away . thought I should have broke my heart .
LIZZIE: Mother ! Are you all mad ?
ELIZABETH: Please Papa , do n't let her go !
MR BENNET: Lydia will never be easy till she has exposed herself in some public place o other , and we can never expect her to do it with so little inconvenience as unde the present circumstances .
ELIZABETH: If you , dear father , will not take the trouble to check her , she will be fixed forever as the silliest and most determined flirt who ever made her family idiculous . And Kitty will follow , as she always does .
MR KENNET: We shall have no peace until she goes .
ELIZABETH: Peace ! Is that all you care about ?
MR BENNET: Colonel Forster is a sensible man and will keep her out of any real mischief , and she is far too poor to be an object of prey to anyone .
ELIZABETH: Father , its dangerous ! -
MR BENNET: I 'm sure the officers will find women etter worth their while . Let us hope , in fact , that her stay in Brighton will teach her her own insignificance . At any ate she can hardly grow any worse , without authorizing us to lock her up fo the rest of her life .
ELIZABETH: No wonder our family is treated with contempt .
MR BENNET: Well , at least the house will be quieter .
ELIZABETH: I do n't wish to be stuck with such a foolish family any longer , with you constant talk of men and marriages . Surely there is more to life .
MRS GARDINER: Lizzie dear , you would be very welcome to accompany us ?
MR GARDINER: Oh yes . We plan to journey through the Peak District . You 'd be most welcome .
MARY: Oh , the glories of nature ! What are men , compared to rocks and mountains ?
ELIZABETH: Believe me , men are either eaten up with arrogance or stupidity . And if they 're amiable they 're so easily led that they have no minds of their own whatsoever .
MRS GARDINER: Take care , my love , that savours strongly of bitterness .
ELIZABETH: No , they bring nothing but heartache .
JANE: Why did you not tell me . Did he mention Mr Bingley . Pause .
ELIZABETH: No . He did not .
WOMAN: â€¢ He 's been taking the waters at Buxton .
LAUGHS: Has n't done him a jot of good .
HER HUSBAND: But we 've had a fine time , have n't we dear ?
WOMAN: We 've visited Chatsworth , Dovedale ,
MRS GARDINER: Pemberley ?
WOMAN: Just two miles from here . close , very close , on Lizzie 's face .
HER HUSBAND: One of the best houses in the country .
TO ELIZABETH: Are n't you acquainted with the owner , M â€¢ Darcy ?
MRS GARDINER: Well , we shall go there tomorrow , Lizzie .
ELIZABETH: I would rather stay here .
MRS GARDINER: Stay here ?
VERY UNCOMFORTABLE: I must own that I 'm tired of great houses . All those carpets and curtains .
MRS GARDINER: But you liked Chatsworth .
ELIZABETH: If it is anything like Mr Darcy , I am sure I will not be able to bear it .
MRS GARDINER: Come , come , Lizzie .
Â€¢: The grounds alone are worth a visit .
MR GARDINER: Let us not make a fuss . If the girl does not want to go there is little point in persuading her .
ELIZABETH: I hear that Pemberley is not far from here .
MAID: Yes , madam .
ELIZABETH: You see something of the owner , do you , in town ?
MAID: Not for some months , madam , for he 's still in London , I believe . A pause . Close on Elizabeth 's face .
Â€¢: 88 EXT . PEMBERLEY - DAY . 8n The carriage enters the gates of Pemberley .
MRS GARDINER: I 'm so glad you changed your mind .
TO ELIZABETH: Keep up .
MRS REYNOLDS: This is my master - Mr Darcy .
MRS GARDINER: A handsome face . Lizzie , is it a true likeness of him ?
MRS REYNOLDS: Does this young lady know Mr Darcy ?
ELIZABETH: Only a little .
MRS REYNOLDS: And do you not think him a handsome man , Miss ?
THOUGHTFULLY: Yes , yes I suppose he is .
MRS REYNOLDS: And this is his sister , Miss Georgians . She plays and sings all day long .
ELIZABETH: â€¢ They are at home ? !
MRS REYNOLDS: Miss Darcy is always down for the summer . Mr Darcy is due here tomorrow .
MR GARDINER: Is your master much at Pemberley ?
MRS REYNOLDS: Not as much as I would wish , sir , or he for he dearly loves it here .
MRS GARDINER: If he should marry , you might see more of him .
MRS REYNOLDS: Yes madam , but I do not know when that will be . I do not know a lady who is good enough for him .
MRS GARDINER: What do you mean ?
MRS REYNOLDS: I 've known Mr Darcy since he was a boy . He was always a kind and generous person even then . Not everyone can see it , ecause he does not make a meal of it like a lot of young men nowadays . But he is the most sweet-tempered and kind- hearted man I have ever known .
DARCY: Miss Bennet !
ELIZABETH: I thought you were in London .
STUPIDLY: No I 'm not .
ELIZABETH: No .
ELIZABETH: I 'm visiting Derbyshire with my uncle and aunt .
DARCY: And are you having a pleasant trip ?
ELIZABETH: Very pleasant . Tomorrow we go to Matlock .
DARCY: â€¢ Tomorrow ?
ELIZABETH: Yes . At the Rose and Crown . Another pause . She extends her hand .
DARCY: May I see you to the village ?
ELIZABETH: Oh no ! I 'm very fond of walking .
DARCY: Yes .
ELIZABETH: Goodbye , Mr Darcy .
Â€¢: She hurries away . He gazes after her .
DARCY: - I shall send my carriage at noon
MR GARDINER: Very civil .
MRS GARDINER: â€¢ Not at all like you painted him .
STARES: To dine with him ?
MRS GARDINER: - there is something pleasing about his mouth , when he speaks .
MR GARDINER: You do n't mind delaying our journey fo another day ? Elizabeth shakes her head , dumbly .
MRS GARDINER: He particularly wishes you to meet his sister .
ELIZABETH: His sister ?
DARCY: My sister , Miss Darcy
GEORGIANA: Miss Elizabeth , my brother has told me so much about you . I feel as if we are friends already .
ELIZABETH: What a beautiful instrument .
GEORGIANA: My brother gave it to me . He should n't have .
DARCY: â€¢ Yes I should .
GEORGIANA: Oh very well then .
DARCY: She 's easily persuaded , is she not ?
SMALL SMILE: What a surprise , Miss Bennet , to see you in Derbyshire .
SMALL NOD: Your brother is well , I trust ?
MISS BINGLEY: Very well . He hopes to come here soon . ( significant glance at
GEORGIANA: Pemberley has a special attraction fo him .
SWEETLY: Yes , the library is particularly splendid , is it not ?
MISS BINGLEY: And how is your family , Miss Bennet ? Someone told me the militia are removed from Meryton .
SIGNIFICANT SMILE: They must be a great loss for some of you Darcy comes to the rescue .
DARCY: Your uncle is fond of fishing , I hear .
ELIZABETH: Yes , very .
DARCY: Can you persuade him to borrow a rod this afternoon ?
MISS BINGLEY: In six months I have never seen anyone so altered . How brown and coarse she has ecome !
DARCY: I perceive no alteration ' except she is ather tanned . Hardly a miraculous consequence of travelling in the summer .
MISS BINGLEY: I remember , when we first knew her in Hertfordshire , you said `` she a beauty ? I would have as soon called her mother a wit ! ''
DARCY: You must have mis-heard , Caroline . Even had I thought it , I would have couched it
Â€¢: with a little more finesse .
ELIZABETH: It is so beautiful up here . I will be sorry to leave . Darcy smiles at her .
Â€¢ DARCY: I have recently thought a great deal about how I appear and act to others .
ELIZABETH: It does you credit , sir .
MR GARDINER: What a capital fellow .
MRS GARDINER: Thank you so much Mr Darcy .
TO LIZZIE: For you , madam .
DELIGHTED: 107 Its from Jane . 10 â€¢ she rips open the letter .
DARCY: Miss Elizabeth . She cries on .
ELIZABETH: It is the most dreadful news . Lydia has un away - with Mr Wickham . They are gone together from Brighton to Lord knows where . She has no money , no connections , I fear she is lost forever .
DARCY: â€¢ This is my fault - if only I had exposed Wickham when I should .
ELIZABETH: No , this is my fault . I might have prevented all of it by merely being open with my sisters rather than too proud with my knowledge .
MRS GARDINER: Has anything been done to recover her ?
ELIZABETH: Father has gone to London . But I know very well that nothing can be done . We have not the smallest hope .
DARCY: Would to heaven that anything could be said or done on my part that could offe consolation to such distress .
ELIZABETH: Sir , it think it is too late .
MR GARDINER: I am afraid we must go at once - I will join Mr Bennet and find Lydia before she uins the family forever .
DARCY: I am so very sorry . This is grave indeed . I will leave you . Goodbye .
MRS BENNET: Why did the Foresters let her out of their sight ? I always said they were unfit to have charge of her .
SMUGLY: And now she is ruined .
MRS BENNET: You are all ruined . Who will take you now with a fallen sister ? Poor Mr Bennet will now have to fight the perfidious Wickham and then be killed
ELIZABETH: He has n't found him yet , Mama .
MRS BENNET: - and The Collins ' will turn us out efore he is cold in his grave -
JANE: Do not be alarmed , mama . Our uncle is helping in the search .
MRS BENNET: Lydia must know what this will do to my nerves , such flutterings and spasms all over me
MR BENNET: Excuse me . They ignore him . He tries again
ELIZABETH: How long is this going to go on for ?
JANE: Do n't be too harsh . This is hard for all of us . They walk downstairs .
ELIZABETH: I ca n't bear not hearing anything .
Â€¢ KITTY: Look . It 's Papa !
KITTY: - who is to fight Wickham and make him marry Lydia , now you 've come home ?
MR BENNET: For God 's sake let me be !
TO LIZZIE: Lizzie , help me with my boots . Elizabeth pulls off his boots for him .
JANE: You suppose them to be still in London ?
NODS: Where else could they be so well concealed ?
ELIZABETH: Oh father , I 'm so sorry .
MR BENNET: â€¢ It 's been my own doing .
ELIZABETH: You must n't be too severe on yourself .
MR BENNET: No Lizzie . Let me once in my life feel how much I have been to blame .
WAN SMILE: I am not afraid of being overpowered by the experience . It will pass away soon enough .
JANE: It 's to Daddy . It 's in uncle 's writing . Mr Bennet snatches the letter .
MR BENNET: As it is addressed to me
KITTY: Are they married ?
MR BENNET: Just wait . I ca n't make out his script .
ELIZABETH: Give it to me .
KITTY: Are they married ?
ELIZABETH: They will be , if father will settle a hundred pounds a year on her . That is Wickham 's condition .
KITTY: A hundred pounds !
ELIZABETH: You will agree to this , father ? The letter is passed around the other girls .
MR BENNET: Of course I will agree . But how much you uncle has laid on this wretched man already is anybody 's guess .
KITTY: What do you mean , Father ?
MR BENNET: No man in his senses would marry Lydia on so slight a temptation as a hundred a year .
ELIZABETH: Ah , I see .
JANE: See what ?
MR BENNET: Your uncle is very generous .
ELIZABETH: Do you think it a large sum ?
MR BENNET: Wickham 's a fool if he takes her for less than ten thousand pounds . I should be sorry to think so ill of him in the very - eginning of our relationship .
JANE: Ten thousand ! Heaven forbid !
MRS BENNET: Lydia married ! And at sixteen too ! Ring the bell , Kitty ! I must put on my things and tell Lady Lucas ! Oh to see her face ! And tell the servants they will have a owl of punch ! The other Bennet 's are assembled .
ELIZABETH: We should thank our uncle , Mama .
MRS BENNET: And so he should help ! He 's much riche than us , and he has n't got any children .
ANGRILY: How can you talk like that ? Her mother gets to her feet .
MRS BENNET: A daughter , married !
ELIZABETH: Is that all you think about ?
MRS BENNET: `` Mrs Wickham '' - how well it sounds
IN DESPERATION: You do n't know what he 's like
MRS BENNET: Now where will they live ? Purvis Lodge might do . Ashworth is vacant of course , ut it 's too far off , I could n't bear to have her ten miles from me -
MR BENNET: Before you take any of these houses , Mrs Bennet , let us be clear . Into one house she will never be welcome . Mrs Bennet stares at him .
LYDIA: - and then we passed Sarah Sims in he carriage so I took off my glove and let my hand just rest on the window frame , so she might see the ring , and then 1 bowed and smiled like anything !
FURIOUS: Lydia !
WICKHAM: I 've been enlisted in a regiment in the north of England , sir . l f G MR BENNET
NODS COLDLY: I 'm glad to hear of it .
WICKHAM: Near Newcastle . We shall travel there next week .
KITTY: â€¢ Can I come and stay with you ?
MR BENNET: That is out . of the question .
LYDIA: Well , Monday morning came and I was in such a fuss -
ELIZABETH: I do n't want to hear -
LYDIA: - there was my aunt , preaching and talking away just as if she was reading a sermon , she was horrid unpleasant -
ELIZABETH: Ca n't you understand why ?
LYDIA: - but I did n't hear a word because I was thinking of my dear Wickham . I longed to â€¢ know whether he would be married in his lue coat
MARY: The north of England , I believe , boasts some spectacular scenery
LYDIA: - and then my uncle was called away from the church on business and I thought - who is to be our best man if he does n't come back ? Lucky he did come back or I would have had to ask Mr Darcy -
STARES: Mr Darcy ?
LYDIA: I forgot ! I should n't have said a word !
Â€¢ ELIZABETH: Mr Darcy was at your wedding ?
WHISPERS: He was the one that discovered us ! He knew where to find Wickham , you see .
HISSES: But do n't tell anyone ! He told me not to tell !
LYDIA: Come on , Wickham ! You 've got to play .
KITTY: Yes , come on !
WICKHAM: I hope we can be even better friends , now we 're brother and sister .
NODS: I met Mr Darcy 's sister .
A BEAT: Did you like her ?
ELIZABETH: Very much . We found a great deal to talk about .
LOW VOICE: Why was Mr Darcy there ?
LYDIA: I 'm not supposed to tell .
ELIZABETH: Please , Lydia !
LYDIA: Because he paid for it .
STARES: For what ?
CARELESSLY: The wedding , Wickham 's commission . Everything .
ELIZABETH: Everything ?
CALLS: Lydia ! It 's your turn ! Lydia moves to go .
LYDIA: People kept saying Wickham owed them money , it was so tedious . So Darcy settled his debts but I do n't really like him , do you ? Lizzie pulls her back .
ELIZABETH: But why did he do it ?
SHRUGS: I do n't know , do I ? Anyway you 're not to tell because it 's supposed to be ou uncle who paid , and he would n't have â€¢ minded paying , either , because I 'm his favorite .
BUTLER: Mr Darcy .
DARCY: I have some business with Mr Bingley .
MRS BENNET: Write to me often , my dear ' . Wickham takes his leave of Elizabeth .
WICKHAM: Please relay my affections to the Darcy 's on your next acquaintance . I am sure he will be pleased to hear things have worked out so well . He joins Lydia .
LYDIA: Married women never have much time fo writing . My sisters may write to me ! They 'll have nothing else to do .
Â€¢: Oh there is nothing so bad as parting with ones children ! One seems so forlorn without them .
ELIZABETH: That is the consequence of marrying a daughter . It must make you bette satisfied that your other four are single .
MRS HILL: Did you hear the news , madam ? Mr Bingley is returning to Netherfield .
MRS BENNET: Mr Bingley ?
MRS HILL: Mrs Nichols is ordering a haunch Of pork , for she expects him tomorrow .
MRS BENNET: Tomorrow ?
RECOVERING: Not that I care about it . Mr Bingley is nothing to us and I 'm sure I never want to see him again .
MOVES AWAY: No , we shall not mention a word about it . Is it quite certain he is coming ?
MRS HILL: Yes , madam . I believe he is alone ; his sister remains in town .
MRS BENNET: Huh ! Come along , girls .
Â€¢: It 's all right , Lizzie . I 'm just glad that he comes alone , because then we shall see less of him .
BLUSHING: Not that I 'm afraid of myself , but I dread other people 's remarks .
KITTY: He is here ! He is here , he 's at the door !
MRS BENNET: Oh my goodness ! Everybody act naturally .
KITTY: Look . There 's someone with him . Mr whats his name . The pompous one from before .
MRS BENNET: Mr Darcy indeed ! The very insolence of 0 0 it . What does he think of coming here ?
Â€¢ JANE: Mama !
MRS BENNET: â€¢ ( to Mary - who is still
PLAYING: Stop that and sit down ! Find yourself some work ! Oh Lord .
SMILES: I did hear of it , and offer my congratulations .
MRS BENNET: - but it 's very hard to have my Lydia taken away from me . Mr Wickham has been transferred to Newcastle , where ever that is . Thank heaven he has some friends .
ELIZABETH: Do you hope to stay long in the country , Mr Bingley ?
BINGLEY: Just a few weeks . For the shooting .
MRS BENNET: When you have killed all your own birds , Mr Bingley , I beg you will come here and shoot as many as you please .
MR BINGLEY: Thank you -
MRS BENNET: - Mr Bennet will be vastly happy to oblige you , and will save all the best of â€¢ the covies for you .
Â€¢: Excellent .
ELIZABETH: Are you well , Mr Darcy ?
DARCY: Quite well , thank you .
ELIZABETH: Well , I hope the weather stays fine , fo your sport .
DARCY: I return to town tomorrow .
A PAUSE: So soon ?
MRS BENNET: My Jane looks well , does she not ? Mr-Bingley stands up abruptly .
BINGLEY: She does indeed . Well , I must be going , I suppose . Darcy -
MRS BENNET: You must come again . For when you were in town last winter you promised to take a family dinner with us . I have not forgot you see . At least three courses .
BINGLEY: Oh damn , damn , buggery , damn .
DARCY: What were you thinking of ?
BINGLEY: Damn and blast , oh buggery , damn .
JANE: Well , I 'm glad that 's over . We can now meet as indifferent acquaintances .
LAUGHING: Oh yes ? Jane , take care .
JANE: You can not think me so weak as to be in
Â€¢: danger now .
ELIZABETH: I think you are in great danger of making him as much in love with you as ever .
JANE: I 'm sorry , though , that he came with M Darcy .
BLURTS OUT: Oh Jane , I have acted so stupidly . Had I een in love , I could not have been more lind !
STARES: What do you mean ? The door bell rings .
KITTY: It is him . He 's back . He 's come again . â€¢ A stunned reaction .
BINGLEY: I , erm , I know this is all very embarrassing , but I would like to request the privilege of speaking to Miss Jane - They all look at him .
MRS BENNET: Girls . Everybody to the kitchen . Immediately . Oh , Mr Bingley . It is so good to see you again so soon .
BINGLEY: Miss Bennet , you have been the victim of a huge misunderstanding . Suffice to say , I have been an unmitigated and comprehensive ass . And therefore , I would like to ask you -
MARY: Ssssshhh !
JANE: â€¢ Yes . A hundred times - yes .
MRS BENNET: Thank the Lord for that . I thought it would never happen .
MR BENNET: I am sure they will do well together ,
Â€¢: their tempers are much alike . They will e cheated assiduously by their servants , and be so generous with the rest , they will always exceed their income .
MRS BENNET: Exceed their income ? He has five thousand a year ! I knew she could not be so eautiful for nothing .
JANE: He has made me so happy . You know , he . was totally ignorant of my being in town last spring !
ELIZABETH: How did he account for it ?
JANE: He thought me indifferent !
ELIZABETH: Unfathomable .
JANE: No doubt poisoned by his pernicious sister .
ELIZABETH: Bravo ! That is the most unforgiving speech you 've ever made .
JANE: Oh Lizzie , if I could but see you so happy . If there were such another man fo you ! There is a noise outside .
ELIZABETH: Perhaps , if I have very good luck , I may meet with another Mr Collins in time . What is that ?
MARY: Maybe he 's changed his mind .
ELIZABETH: Lady Catherine !
LADY CATHERINE: And these are your daughters , I suppose .
MRS BENNET: All but one , the youngest has been lately married your ladyship . And my eldest was only proposed to yesterday afternoon .
LADY CATHERINE: You have a very small garden , madam .
MRS BENNET: â€¢ I am sure it is nothing compared to Rosings , but it is larger than Si William Lucas 's , I can assure you .
TENTATIVELY: Could I offer you a cup of tea , perhaps ?
LADY CATHERINE: Absolutely not ! I must speak to Miss Elizabeth alone , as a matter of complete urgency .
ELIZABETH: Indeed you are mistaken . I can not account for this honour at all .
LADY CATHERINE: Miss Bennet , I warn you , I am not to be trifled with . A report of a most alarming nature has reached me that you intend to e united with my nephew , Mr Darcy . Elizabeth stares at her , amazed .
ELIZABETH: If you believed it impossible , I wonde you took the trouble of coming so far .
LADY CATHERINE: To hear it contradicted , Miss Bennet .
COOLLY: Your coming here will be rather a confirmation , surely , if indeed such a eport exists .
LADY CATHERINE: If ? Do you then pretend to be ignorant of it ? Has it not been industriously circulated by yourself ?
ELIZABETH: I have never heard of it .
LADY CATHERINE: And can you declare there is no foundation for it ?
ELIZABETH: I do not pretend to possess equal frankness with your ladyship . You may ask the questions , which I may not choose to answer .
LADY CATHERINE: This is not to be borne . Has my nephew made you an offer of marriage ?
ELIZABETH: Your Ladyship declared it to be impossible .
LADY CATHERINE: Let me be understood . Mr Darcy is engaged to my daughter . Now what have you to say ?
ELIZABETH: Only this - if that is the case you can have no reason to suppose he will make an offer to me .
LADY CATHERINE: Oh obstinate girl ! This union has been planned since their infancy . Do you think it can be prevented by a young woman of inferior birth , of no importance in the world and wholly unallied to his family ? Whose own sister 's elopement resulted in the scandalously patched-up marriage , only achieved at the expense of you uncle ? Heaven and earth , are the shades of Pemberly to be thus polluted ? Now tell me once and for all , are you engaged to him ?
ELIZABETH: I am not .
LADY CATHERINE: And will you promise never to enter into such an engagement ?
ELIZABETH: I will not . And I certainly never shall . Allow me to say , the arguments which you have supported this extraordinary application have been as frivolous as the application was ill-judged . You have , insulted me in every possible method and can now have nothing further to say . I must ask you to leave immediately . Good night .
LADY CATHERINE: I have never been thus treated in my entire life .
MR BENNET: Lizzie , what on earth is going on ?
ELIZABETH: Just a small misunderstanding . She walks past them to bed .
MRS BENNET: Lizzie !
ELIZABETH: For once in your life . Just leave me alone .
ELIZABETH: Mr Darcy !
DARCY: What are you doing out here so early ?
ELIZABETH: I could not sleep .
DARCY: Me neither . I have been up.most of the night .
ELIZABETH: Mr Darcy , I must thank you for you unexampled generosity to both my sisters . I know what kindnesses you have done fo poor Lydia and suspect your hand in the happy resolution for Jane also .
DARCY: I am alarmed that you know of what I have een so in earnest to keep silent . But you must know that your happiness was one of my prime inducements . Elizabeth looks at Darcy .
Â€¢: one word from you will silence me forever .
ELIZABETH: I am very happy to inform you that not only have my sentiments changed there are no other words which could give me greater pleasure .
MRS BENNET: Lizzie , where have you been . We thought something had happened to you . Darcy follows Elizabeth in .
ELIZABETH: Mr Darcy has come to speak with Papa . Everyone is stunned .
MR BENNET: Lizzie , are you out of your senses ? I thought you hated the man .
ELIZABETH: No , Papa .
MR BENNET: He is rich , to be sure , and you will have more fine carriages than Jane . But will that make you happy ?
UNCOMFORTABLE: Have you no other objection than you elief in my indifference ?
MR BENNET: None at all . We all know him to be a proud , unpleasant sort of fellow , but this would be nothing if you really liked him .
ELIZABETH: I do like him !
WITH PASSION: I love him ! He 's not proud . It 's I who 's een prejudiced , who did n't realize You do n't know him , Papaif I told you what he 's really like . What he 's done .
MR BENNET: What has he done ?
ELIZABETH: No , you must n't tell anyone ! He would n't want it .
PAUSE: We misjudged him , me more than anyone . In every way , not just in this matter . I 've een so blind . He 's been so blind ! About Jane , about so many things . Then so have
BREATHLESS PAUSE: You see , he and I are so similiarwe 're oth so stubborn
SHAKY LAUGH: Oh Papa
MR BENNET: You do love him , do n't you ? Elizabeth nods .
ELIZABETH: â€¢ Very much .
MR BENNET: I can not believe that anyone can deserve you , but it seems I am over-ruled . So I heartily give my consent .
ELIZABETH: Oh thank you ! She starts to rush out .
MR BENNET: And if any young men come for Mary o Kitty , send them in , for I am quite at â€¢ leisure .
DARCY: Allow me , Mrs Darcy .
ELIZABETH: How did it begin ?
DARCY: I can not fix the hour , or the spot , o
Â€¢: the look . It was too long ago and I was in the middle before I knew it had begun .
ELIZABETH: Now be sincere , did you admire me for my impertinenc ?
DARCY: For the liveliness of your mind , I did .
ELIZABETH: You may as well call it impertinence , though make a virtue of it by all means . My good qualities are under you protection , and you are to exaggerate - them as much as possible . And , in return , it belongs to me to find occasions fo teasing and quarrelling with you as often as maybe and I shall begin directly

OLD MAN: Take another step and you 'll be meetin ' the Lord directly .
HICKS: Easy now old timer . I 'm a sheriff .
OLD MAN: Ai n't no law out here but my own .
HICKS: Sounds like a bunch of religious mumbo jumbo to me . The old man stares fixedly at Priest .
OLD MAN: Now you tell the Clergy this here is an authentic miracle , I want it registered . It 's mine .
PRIEST: Miracle ?
OLD MAN: The Angels . Never seen so many loot souls , breaks my heart just to think of it . This ai n't no place for nothin ' divine .
PRIEST: You saw angels ?
OLD MAN: Sure as chit .
PRIEST: How many ?
OLD MAN: Do n't know , too many to count . Hundreds . Thousands . Some nights the sky was so thick you could n't see the stars .

HICKS: That 's angel shit ?
OLD MAN: Scooped it up myself . You wan na hold it ? Hicks backs away , shaking his head .
PRIEST: These angelsdi.d you ever see them during the day ?

PRIEST: Home ?
OLD MAN: The castle -
LEANS FORWARD: I never would disturb ` em though . God 's children like their privacy .
OLD MAN: Wait ! I want you to have somethin ' efore you go
LUCY: Thank you . The Familiar turns to leave .
SARCASTIC: Yep . Truly a wonder of the worldgood thing we listened to the fossil . Do n't know how we 'd find Lucy without him .
PRIEST: Vampires sometimes use abandoned structures as a perch . Watch for booby traps . And with that he enters the
HICKS: Why we listen ' to that crackpot ? Crazy fucker 's so blinded by faith he 's atahit . That 's called a zealot in my . ook .
BEAT: I 'm startin ' to think you might be one yourself . You ever think bout that ? Priest does n't respond , squinting his eyes .
HICKS: This is bullshit . Lucy 's been gone five days ' every stupid minute we waste here is a minute more she gets farther-away .
PRIEST: Stay here . If anything comes up the steps that is n't me Shoot it .
HICKS: Great .
PRIESTESS: How did you find me ?

PRIESTESS: I 've been busy . Off Priest 's reaction we CUT TO
HICKS: Shit .
PRIESTESS: If you did n't come for mewhy are you here ?
PRIEST: I should be asking you the same question .
PRIESTESS: There 's another one around here somewhere .
PRIEST: Where ?
PRIESTESS: I do n't knowbut it 's not like the others .
PRIEST: Hicks .
HICKS: What the hell is that thing ? I
PRIESTESS: Should we lead it into open air ? More oom to . maneuver .
PRIEST: Better to keep it contained .
PRIESTESS: Or not . They race outside .
PRIESTESS: Not bad .
HICKS: Point Ameet point fuckin ' B .
PRIEST: This was a Pureblood .
PRIESTESS: we both know that 's impossible They have n't existed for a millennium .
BEAT: What 's going on here ?
PRIEST: .I do n't know .
PRIESTESS: Sector Seven was the only place I could find work . Waste Management .
BEAT: Nobody else would hire me . % No applicable skills. &
PRIEST: I heard that one too .
PRIESTESS: A week ago , a family camping out on the Perimeter approached me .Told me vampires were terrorizing their village and that the government would n't do anything about it .
PRIEST: Did you go to The Clergy ?
PRIESTESS: They would n't see me ,
BEAT: I 've been on their trail eve sincecould be the same group who took your niece .
PRIEST: Could be . The Priestess glances towards Hicks .
PRIESTESS: Does the lawman know what you 'll do if you find her ?
PRIEST: He knows .
PRIESTESS: He 'll try to stop you .
PRIEST: He wo n't be able to . She pauses a moment , regarding him .
PRIESTESS: You know , some nights I still dream we 're ack on the frontlines I wake up , I 'm sweating my muscles all clenched like I 'm ready for something But I do n't know what .
PRIEST: Me too .
PRIESTESS: Nights like that I do n't go back to sleep .
BEAT: But on other nights the good nights I dream about other things .
PRIEST: ..Like what ?
PRIESTESS: You .
HICKS: - Hey.you guys better get a look at thisl
PRIESTESS: it must be a birthmark of some kind .
HICKS: That ai n't no birthmark it 's a brand .
PRIESTESS: There 's something else you need to see
PRIEST: It 's a tomb . Big enough for an army .
HICKS: Guess they 're not as endangered as everyone thought .
BEAT: 0 But where 'd they go ? .
PRIEST: Only one way to find out
HICKS: Are Priests allowed to , you knowhave elations ?
PRIESTESS: We take a vow of celibacy at inception .
HICKS: LookI was uh , wondering . how did he do that little stunt back there ?
PRIESTESS: All Priests can do it .
HICKS: Including you ? She nods .
PRIESTESS: No trick . You just have to remember .
HICKS: Remember what ?
PRIESTESS: Time is relative .
PRIEST: You said the next nearest town was Jericho .
HICKS: Yeah .
PRIEST: Then we better go see .
HICKS: . See what ?
PRIESTESS: What they left of it .
PRIEST: We separate . Go through each building , see what we find .
HICKS: I 'll start with the sheriff .
PRIESTESS: Be careful . Just because it 's daylight does n't mean it 's safe .
HICKS: 'Damn .
OMINOUS: Too many mouths to feed .
HICKS: Where 's Priest ?
FACES: They 're Priests .
HICKS: Do n't make no sense . What were they doin ' out here ?
PRIESTESS: The same thing as us .
BEAT: Someone 's drawing us out .
HICKS: Who ?
PRIEST: We 're not going back .
PRIESTESS: We 'll burn for this .
PRIEST: We already are .
HICKS: It 's a railroad spike . My pop used to work boxcars before they shut down Why the hell would anyone wan na swallow that ? A beat as Priest puts it together .
PRIEST: He wanted us to find it . It 's a clue .
PRIESTESS: Where 's the closest track ?
HICKS: The Dunkirk Line . It starts all the way in the backcountry , bought the ore from the deep mines . There were about five stops along the route . I think .
PRIEST: Where ?
HICKS: The Cities .
PRIESTESS: They must have been picking up different factions along the way . Moving during the day , feeding at night .
HICKS: But headin ' to the Cities is suicide . The sun will kill ` em there 's nowhere to hide . Priest gazes at the map , deeply troubled .
PRIEST: They wo n't have to .
DARK FIGEMH: A fine catch yes ? ( the voice is oily , a dark
WHISPER: She 'd be dead if not for meswallowed y the wasteland .
BLACK HAT: What do you want for her ?
RUNE: You know what r want .
BLACK HAT: Do n't . go too far , Rune .
RUNE: He comes for her still .
BLACK HAT: Of course he does .
RUNE: Let me have him .
BLACK HAT: No .
RUNE': I 'm sure she 'll fetch a nice price out In the zone they do n't care what condition their meat 's inas long as it 's easy to chew .
BLACK HAT: Do n't get involved in this .
RUNE: I was involved long before you showed up .
SEETHING: I 've been waiting years for a chance at himand now that he 's here I find x have to ask a Prime permission
BEAT: Maybe it 's time to return the favor .
BLACK HAT: Fine . He 's Yours .
RUNE: And she 's yours .
BEAT: A shame he 'll never see what you 'll ecome . I would 've loved to see his face .
HICKS: Beggar 's Passit ai n't gon na be easy .
PRIESTESS: We'need more than a jump . We need a miracle .
HICKS: That 's the funny thing about time
PRIESTESS: You should try harder , sheriff .
HICKS: You ever regret it ? Bein ' a Priest ?
PRIESTESS: No .
HICKS: What about a husband , childrenA family ?
PRIESTESS: I 've had a family just not the kind you 're familiar with .
HICKS: What ? You mean Mr. Laffs over there ?
PRIESTESS: He 's not so bad once you get to know him . A beat , Hick 's expression becoming serious .
HICKS: He 's going to kill her , is n't he ? If . she 's turned .
PRIESTESS: Yes .
HICKS: There 's things that can be done . She does n't have to die .
PRIESTESS: She 's his bloodline and he 's a Priest . It 's the only way .
HICKS: And how many of you Priests are left now ? A long moment before she speaks .
PRIESTESS: Two . Hicks does n't know what to Say- , ,
HICKS: .I 'm sorry. ,
PRIESTESS: Yes .
PRIEST: Retreat !
WINKS: What do you think Am I a `` Dapper Dan '' ?
PRIESTESS: Why would the Clergy forbid us from seeing each other ?
PRIEST: Maybe they were scared of what we could do .
PRIESTESS: Or what we would do .
PAUSE: We both know there 's something inside the Order that 's off . Even if we do n't know what it is .
PRIEST: With or without the Clergywe 're still Priests . And we 're the only ones who can stop that train .
PRIESTESS: If we survive this we need to expose them for what they are .
PAUSE: We won ' t survive this .
PRIESTESS: You scared to die ? _
PRIEST: No .
PRIESTESS: I believed in Heaven my whole life . Believed everything we were taught And nowwhen it 's finally my timeno more faith . They took it away from me .
PRIEST: Whatever happens . .. Wherever it is we go . We 'll go together .
PRIESTESS: What ?
PRIEST: It 's a riddle . The Priestess thinks about it .
BEAT: Nothing is greater than God . Nothing is more evil than the devil . The poor have nothing , the rich need nothing . And if you eat nothing you 'll die .
PRIESTESS: The good nights .
PRIEST: Yes . The good nights . Do you think maybe tonight
PRIESTESS: Could be one of those nights ? She smiles .
HICKS: I- ee itl
PRIEST: I know you 're there .
RUNE: It still is
HICKS: Six-shooter pointed right at him .
HISSING: Another time , Priest .
HICKS: Tell me you wo n't kill her . Priest does n't reply .
PRIEST: Finally showing your true colors . A beat . The Priestess looks at Hicks .
PRIESTESS: What 's he talking about ?
PRIEST: He 's a halfbreed . Hicks cocks the gun .
HICKS: Do n't turn this into somethin ' it 's not .
PRIEST: You 've been itching to do this since Nightshade .
HICKS: She 's your kin , goddamit !
PRIEST: if she 's turnedshe 's nobody 's kin .
HICKS: Things can be done . Things to lessen the thirst . She can have a normal life , she does n't have to die . Priest nods grimly .
PRIEST: It 's our way .
HICKS: And what is that ? Some special Priest code of honor ? You do n't get it . You `` way ' It 's over !
PRIEST: Shoot me and it wo n't matter if you find Lucy . You wo n't stop that train and you wo n't save her .
PRIESTESS: He 's right . We need to be together on this it 's the only shot we have .
HICKS: This ai n't done . He lowers his gun and walks away .
SHOUTING: You think they see us ?
PRIEST: Make sure you get on that train ,
BEAT: I 'll catch up .
PRIESTESS: You ready ?
HICKS: My.tuxn now , Priest . BAMI He kicks the door in
BLACK HAT: `` And the third day He shall rise again .
PRIEST: .How ? Black Hat smiles , baring hi fangs .
BLACK HAT: Oh ye of little faith .
PRIEST: .They turned you .
BLACK HAT: No , PriestI turned them . He smiles wider as we CROSSCUT TO
BLACK HAT: Lost souls abandoned by divinity . No elief , no voice to guide them through the wilderness . Sound familiar ? Priest does n't reply , warily eyeing him .
PRIEST: By murdering innocents ?
BLACK HAT: By drawing a once great race back to their '' nature . By helping them discover ' the mastery within themselves .
PRIEST: who ?
BLACK HAT: Me .
PRIEST: So this is how you go about it ? One by one killing every last remaining Priest ?
BLACK HAT: It was the only way . The Cities are defenseless nowno one left to stop us from entering our Eden . But I was kind I gave every last one the choice I neve had .
SMILES: Now it 's your turn .
BEAT: It 's time to make way for new blood .
PRIEST: Yours .
BLACK HAT: They taught us God created man in His image . . .but they lied . Man created God in a image And so , like man , God is weak . Corrupt . Merciless .
SMILES: How do you think I 'm getting into the cities ? Priest 's face drops .
PRIEST: I do n't believe you .
BLACK HAT: Your faith has failed you Priest .
BEAT: Join me . Join me and have the best of oth worlds Walk in the sun . Stalk in the night . Why pray to a God when you can BE one ?
BLACK HAT: Your problem is you keep looking to God for-your power But I know the real truth .
BEAT: You 've been praying to an empty sky .
HICKS: Shit .
HICKS: 'Dam .
HICKS: Lucy ?
PRIEST: Give her to me ! Hurry !
HICKS: We should jump !
PRIEST: Not until we stop the trains
SWALLOWS: Too late .
PRIEST: What happens next happens fast
HORRIFIED: They 're gon na make it .
PRIEST: No , they 're not .
THE SUN: PUNCHES through the teeming mass .
HICKS: You knew they would n't make it . A long time before Priest answers .
PRIEST: She knew .
PRIEST: `` You shall wash me and I shall be made whiter than snow . Glory be to the Fathe and to the Son and to the Holy Spirit
BEAT: Amen .
PRIESTESS: I wish we could 've had more time .
PRIEST: .Me too .
PRIESTESS: Wherever it is we go we go together , ight ?
HICKS: When you 're finished You know where to find me . A tense beat then
ORELAS: Ecces Agnes Dei , ecces qui tollit peccata mundi .
ORELAS: And why should n't we live forever ?
HISSES: We 're God 's very voice . His vessel !
BLACK HAT: With them I can start anew ! You ca n't stop it
SMILES: Must be God 's will .
WHISPERS: Forgive me . He collapses , making the sign of the cross .
KOEPPEN: Am I next ?
CALLING OUT: People do n't run ! God is here for youl He wants you to STOPI Stop and ask yourself a question
AARON: I ca n't thank you enough for what you 've done , sheriff .
HICKS: Just make sure she keeps on the tea . It 's a special brew lessens the loodthirstsomething my granddad taught me .
HICKS: It does n't have to be like this . Priest just stands , staring . Hick 's hand curls around the revolver .
PRIEST: Stares into his eyes and
SHIT: He RACES back to the cabin
AARON: All done .
BEAT: We heard you fire your gun . is everything OK ? A beat then Hicks nods .
HICKS: Nothing to worry about , just a coyote . Aaron smiles , happy enough to be with Lucy .
AARON: Well we 're all God 's creatures .
BEAT: I think it 's for youand Lucy .
MOTHER: You feeling any better ?
THE KID: A little bit .
MOTHER: Guess what .
THE KID: What ?
MOTHER: Your grandfather 's here .
THE KID: Mom , ca n't you tell him that I 'm sick ?
MOTHER: You are sick , that 's why he 's here .
THE KID: He 'll pinch my cheek . I hate that .
MOTHER: Maybe he wo n't .
GRANDFATHER: Hey ! How 's the sickie ? Heh ?
MOTHER: I think I 'll leave you two pals .
GRANDFATHER: I brought you a special present .
THE KID: What is it ?
GRANDFATHER: Open it up . The Kid does . He does his best to smile .
THE KID: A book ?
GRANDFATHER: That 's right . When I was you age , television was called books . And this is a special book . It was the book my father used to ead to me when I was sick , and I used to read it to your father . And today , I 'm gon na read it to you .
THE KID: Has it got any sports in it ?
GRANDFATHER: Are you kidding ? Fencing . Fighting . Torture . Revenge . Giants . Monsters . Chases . Escapes . True love . Miracles .
THE KID: It does n't sound too bad . I 'll try and stay awake .
GRANDFATHER: Oh . Well , thank you very much . It 's very nice of you . Your vote of confidence is overwhelming . All right . The Princess Bride , by S. Morgenstern . Chapter One . Buttercup was raised on a small farm in the country of Florin .
THE KID: Yeah . It 's really good .
GRANDFATHER: Nothing gave Buttercup as much pleasure as ordering Westley around .
BUTTERCUP: Farm boy . Polish my horse 's saddle . I want to see my face shining in it by morning .
WESTLEY: As you wish .
GRANDFATHER: `` As you wish '' was all he eve said to her .
BUTTERCUP: Farm Boy . Fill these with water please .
WESTLEY: As you wish .
GRANDFATHER: That day , she was amazed to discover that when he was saying , `` As you wish , '' what he meant was , `` I love you . ''
BUTTERCUP: Farm Boy , fetch me that pitcher .
WESTLEY: As you wish . Now he turns , moves outside .
THE KID: -hold it , hold it-
GRANDFATHER: wait , just wait
THE KID: well , when does it get good ?
GRANDFATHER: Keep your shirt on . Let me read . Westley had no money for marriage . So he packed his few belongings and left the farm to seek his fortune across the sea .
THE KID: I do n't be-leeve this .
BUTTERCUP: I fear I 'll never see you again .
WESTLEY: Of course you will .
BUTTERCUP: But what if something happens to you ?
WESTLEY: Hear this now I will come for you .
BUTTERCUP: But how can you be sure ?
WESTLEY: This is true love . You think this happens every day ?
GRANDFATHER: Westley did n't reach his destination . His ship was attacked y the Dread Pirate Roberts , who never left captives alive . When Buttercup got the news that Westley was murdered
THE KID: murdered by pirates is good
GRANDFATHER: She went into her room and shut the door . And for days , she neither slept nor ate .
BUTTERCUP: I will never love again . HOLD ON HER FACE , perfect and perfectly sad .
GRANDFATHER: Five years later , the main square of Florin City was filled as never before to hear the announcement of the great Prince Humperdinck 's bride-to be .
HUMPERDINCK: My people a month from now , our country will have its 500th anniversary . On that sundown , I shall marry a lady who was once a commoner like yourselves but perhaps you will not find her common now . Would you like to meet her ?
GRANDFATHER: Buttercup 's emptiness consumed her . Although the law of the land gave Humperdinck the right to choose his bride , she did not love him .
GRANDFATHER: Despite Humperdinck 's reassurance that she would grow to love him , the only joy she found was in he daily ride .
VOICE: A word , my lady ?
VIZZINI: We are but poor , lost circus performers . Is there a village nearby ?
BUTTERCUP: There is nothing nearby ; not fo miles .
VIZZINI: Then there will be no one to hea you scream-
INIGO: What is that you 're ripping ?
VIZZINI: It 's fabric from the uniform of an Army officer of Guilder .
FEZZIK: Who 's Guilder ?
VIZZINI: The country across the sea . The sworn enemy of Florin . Go ! The horse takes off . They start for the boat .
FEZZIK: You never said anything about killing anyone . Vizzini hops onto the boat .
VIZZINI: I 've hired you to help me start a war . That 's a prestigious line of work with a long and glorious tradition .
FEZZIK: I just do n't think it 's right , killing an innocent girl .
VIZZINI: Am I going mad or did the word `` think '' escape your lips ? You were not hired for your brains , you hippopotamic land mass .
INIGO: I agree with Fezzik .
VIZZINI: Oh . The sot has spoken . What happens to her is not truly you concern I will kill her And remember this never forget this
INIGO: That Vizzini , he can fuss .
FEZZIK: fuss fuss I think he likes to scream at us .
INIGO: Probably he means no harm .
FEZZIK: He 's really very short on charm .
INIGO: Oh , you 've a great gift for rhyme .
FEZZIK: Yes , some of the time .
VIZZINI: Enough of that .
INIGO: FEZZIK , are there rocks ahead ?
FEZZIK: If there are , we 'll all be dead .
VIZZINI: No more rhymes now , I mean it .
FEZZIK: Anybody want a peanut ? As Vizzini screams we
VIZZINI: We 'll reach the Cliffs by dawn . Inigo nods , glances back .
INIGO: Making sure nobody 's following us .
VIZZINI: That would be inconceivable .
BUTTERCUP: Despite what you think , you will e caught . And when you are , the Prince will see you all hanged . Vizzini turns a cold eye on the Princess .
VIZZINI: Of all the necks on this boat , Highness , the one you should be worrying about is your own . Inigo keeps staring behind them .
INIGO: You 're sure nobody 's following us ?
VIZZINI: As I told you , it would be absolutely , totally , and in all other ways , inconceivable . No one in Guilder knows what we 've done . And no one in Florin could have gotten here so fast . Out of curiosity , why do you ask ?
INIGO: No reason . It 's only , I just happened to look behind us , and something is there .
VIZZINI: What ?
VIZZINI: Go in , get after her !
INIGO: I do n't swim .
FEZZIK: I only dog paddle .
VIZZINI: Veer left . Left . Left !
VIZZINI: Do you know what that sound is , Highness ? Those are the Shrieking Eels if you doubt me , just wait . They always grow loude when they 're about to feed on human flesh .
VIZZINI: If you swim back now , I promise , no harm will come to you . I doubt you will get such an offer from the Eels .
GRANDFATHER: She does n't get eaten by the Eels at this time . And the second we hear him
THE KID: What ?
GRANDFATHER: The Eel does n't get her . I 'm explaining to you because you looked nervous .
THE KID: Well , I was n't nervous . His Grandfather says nothing , just waits .
GRANDFATHER: Because I can stop now if you want .
THE KID: No . You could read a little bit more if you want .
GRANDFATHER: `` Do you know what that sound is , Highness ? ''
THE KID: We 're past that , Grandpa .
GRANDFATHER: Oh . Oh my goodness , I did . I 'm sorry . Beg your pardon .
GRANDFATHER: All right , all right , let 's see . Uh , she was in the water , the Eel was coming after her . She was frightened . The Eel started to charge her . And then -
VIZZINI: Put her down . Just put her down .
VIZZINI: He 's no concern of ours . Sail on ! I suppose you think you 're brave , do n't you ?
BUTTERCUP: Only compared to some .
INIGO: Look ! He 's right on top of us . I wonder if he is using the same wind we are using .
VIZZINI: Whoever he is , he 's too late see ? The Cliffs of Insanity .
VIZZINI: Hurry up . Move the thing ! Um that other thing . Move it ! We 're safe only FEZZIK is strong enough to go up our way he 'll have to sail around fo hours 'til he finds a harbor .
VIZZINI: Inconceivable !
FEZZIK: I thought I was going faster .
VIZZINI: You were supposed to be this colossus . You were this great , legendary thing . And yet he gains .
FEZZIK: Well , I 'm carrying three people . And he 's got only himself .
VIZZINI: I do not accept excuses . I 'm just going to have to find myself a new giant , that 's all .
FEZZIK: Do n't say that , Vizzini . Please . And his arms begin moving much more slowly .
VIZZINI: Did I make it clear that your jo is at stake ?
INIGO: You keep using that word I do not think it means what you think it means . My God ! He 's climbing .
VIZZINI: Whoever he is , he 's obviously seen us with the Princess , and must therefore die . You , carry her . We 'll head straight for the Guilder frontier . Catch up when he 's dead . If he falls , fine . If not , the sword . Inigo nods .
INIGO: I want to duel him left-handed .
VIZZINI: You know what a hurry we 're in .
INIGO: Well , it 's the only way I can be satisfied . If I use my right tch over too quickly .
VIZZINI: Oh , have it your way .
VIZZINI: I 'm waiting ! FEZZIK nods , hurries after Vizzini .
INIGO: I was eleven years old . When I was strong enough , I dedicated my life to the study of fencing . So the next time we meet , I will not fail . I will go up to the sixfingered man and say , `` Hello , my name is Inigo Montoya . You killed my father . Prepare to die . ''
VIZZINI: Inconceivable !
FEZZIK: What do I do ?
VIZZINI: Finish him , finish him . Your way .
FEZZIK: Oh , good , my way . Thank you , Vizzini . Which way is my way ?
VIZZINI: Pick up one of those rocks , get ehind the boulder , and in a few minutes , the Man in Black will come running around the bend . The minute his head is in view , hit it with the rock ! As Vizzini and Buttercup hurry away .
FEZZIK: My way 's not very sportsmanlike .
HUMPERDINCK: There was a mighty duel it anged all over . They were both masters .
RUGEN: Who won ? How did it end ?
HUMPERDINCK: The loser ran off alone . The winner followed those footprints toward Guilder !
RUGEN: Shall we track them both ?
HUMPERDINCK: The loser is nothing . Only the Princess matters clearly this was all planned y warriors of Guilder . We must e ready for whatever lies ahead .
RUGEN: Could this be a trap ?
HUMPERDINCK: I always think everything could e a trap Which is why I 'm still alive . And he gallops off
VIZZINI: So , it is down to you . And it is down to me . The Man In Black nods and comes nearer
VIZZINI: I 'm afraid so I ca n't compete with you physically . And you 're no match for my brains .
BUTTERCUP: Who are you ?
HUMPERDINCK: Someone has beaten a giant ! There will be great suffering in Guilder if she dies . He leaps onto his horse and they charge off .
BUTTERCUP: If you 'll release me whateve you ask for ransom you 'll get it , I promise you
HUMPERDINCK: Iocane . I 'd bet my life on it . And there are the Princess 's footprints . She is alive o was , an hour ago . If she is otherwise when I find her , I shall be very put out .
BUTTERCUP: And what am I ?
HUMPERDINCK: Disappeared . He must have seen us closing in , which might account for his panicking in error . Unless I 'm wrong , and I am neve wrong , they are headed dead into the fire swamp .
WESTLEY: Can you move at all ?
BUTTERCUP: Move ? You 're alive . If you want , I can fly .
WESTLEY: I told you , `` I would always come for you . '' Why did n't you wait fo me ?
BUTTERCUP: Well you were dead .
WESTLEY: Death can not stop true love . All it can do is delay it for a while .
BUTTERCUP: I will never doubt again .
WESTLEY: There will never be a need .
THE KID: Oh no . No , please .
GRANDFATHER: What is it ? What 's the matter ?
THE KID: They 're kissing again , do we have to hear the kissing part ?
GRANDFATHER: Someday , you may not mind so much .
THE KID: Skip on to the Fire Swamp that sounded good .
GRANDFATHER: Oh . You 're sick , I 'll humor you . So now , where were we here ? Yeah , yeah , yeah . Ah . Oh . Okay . Westley and Buttercup raced along the avine floor .
WESTLEY: Nonsense you 're only saying that because no one ever has .
BUTTERCUP: You ?
WESTLEY: Well , one thing I will say . The Fire Swamp certainly does keep you on your toes .
BUTTERCUP: But how is that possible , since he 's been marauding twenty years and you only left me five years ago ?
WESTLEY: I myself am often surprised at life 's little quirks .
BUTTERCUP: What ? go on
WESTLEY: Well , Roberts had grown so rich , he wanted to retire . So he took me to his cabin and told me his secret . `` I am not the Dread Pirate Roberts , '' he said . `` My name is Ryan . I inherited this ship from the previous Dread Pirate Roberts , just as you will inherit it from me . The man I inherited it from was not the eal Dread Pirate Roberts , either .
WESTLEY: So we sailed ashore , took on an entirely new crew and he stayed aboard for awhile as first mate , all the time calling me Roberts . Once the crew believed , he left the ship and I have been Roberts ever since . Except , now that we 're together , I shall retire and hand the name over to someone else . Is everything clear to you ?
WESTLEY: No . No . We have already succeeded .
BUTTERCUP: Westley , what about the R.O.U.S . 's ?
WESTLEY: Rodents of Unusual Size ? I do n't think they exist
WESTLEY: Now , was that so terrible ?
HUMPERDINCK: Surrender !
WESTLEY: You mean you wish to surrender to me ? Very well , I accept .
HUMPERDINCK: I give you full marks fo avery do n't make yourself a fool .
WESTLEY: Ah , but how will you capture us ? We know the secrets of the Fire Swamp . We can live there quite happily for some time . So , whenever you feel like dying , feel free to visit .
HUMPERDINCK: I tell you once again surrender !
WESTLEY: It will not happen !
HUMPERDINCK: For the last time SURRENDER !
HUMPERDINCK: May I live a thousand years and never hunt again .
BUTTERCUP: He is a sailor on the pirate ship `` Revenge . '' Promise to return him to his ship .
HUMPERDINCK: I swear it will be done .
RUGEN: I swear it will be done .
BUTTERCUP: I thought you were dead once , and it almost destroyed me . I could not bear it if you died again , not when I could save you .
RUGEN: Come , sir . We must get you to your ship .
WESTLEY: We are men of action . Lies do not ecome us .
RUGEN: Well spoken , sir Westley is looking at him .
WESTLEY: You have six fingers on you ight hand someone was looking for you
ALBINO: The Pit of Despair .
WESTLEY: Then I 'm here till I die ?
ALBINO: Till they kill you . Yeah .
WESTLEY: Then why bother curing me ?
ALBINO: The Prince and the Count always insist on everyone being healthy efore they 're broken .
WESTLEY: So it 's to be torture . The albino nods .
ALBINO: You survived the Fire Swamp . You must be very brave but nobody withstands The Machine .
HUMPERDINCK: She 's been like that ever since the Fire Swamp . It 's my father 's failing health that 's upsetting her .
RUGEN: Of course . As they move on
GRANDFATHER: The King died that very night , and before the following dawn , Buttercup and Humperdinck were married .
HUMPERDINCK: My father 's final words were
THE KID: hold it . Hold it , Grandpa .
GRANDFATHER: Well , who says life is fair ? Where is that written ? Life is n't always fair .
THE KID: I 'm telling you you 're messing up the story , now get it right !
GRANDFATHER: Do you want me to go on with this ?
THE KID: Yes .
GRANDFATHER: All right , then . No more interruptions . at noon , she met her subjects again . This time as their Queen . And on these words
HUMPERDINCK: My father 's final words were `` love her as I loved her , and there will be joy . '' I present to you your Queen . Queen Buttercup . And on his words
BUTTERCUP: Why do you do this ?
ANCIENT BOOER: Because you had love in you hands , and you gave it up .
BUTTERCUP: But they would have killed Westley if I had n't done it .
ANCIENT BOOER: Your true love lives and you marry another True love saved her in the Fire Swamp , and she treated it like garbage . And that 's what she is , the Queen of Refuse ! So , bow down to her if you want . Bow to her . Bow to the Queen of Slime , the Queen of Filth , the Queen of Putrescence . Boo ! Boo ! Rubbish ! Filth ! Slime ! Muck ! Boo ! Boo !
GRANDFATHER: It was ten days till the wedding . The King still lived , but Buttercup 's nightmares were growing steadily worse .
THE KID: See ? Did n't I tell you she 'd never marry that rotten Humperdinck ?
GRANDFATHER: yes , you 're very smart . Shut-Up .
HUMPERDINCK: I could never cause you grief ; consider our wedding off . You returned this Westley to his ship ?
RUGEN: Yes .
HUMPERDINCK: Then we will simply alert him . Beloved , are you certain he still wants you ? After all , it was you who did the leaving in the Fire Swamp . Not to mention that pirates are not known to be men of their words .
BUTTERCUP: My Westley will always come for me .
HUMPERDINCK: I suggest a deal . You write fou copies of a letter . I 'll send my four fastest ships . One in each direction . The Dread Pirate Roberts is always close to Florin this time of year . We 'll run up the white flag and deliver you message . If Westley wants you , less you both . If not please consider me as an alternative to suicide . Are we agreed ? And she nods
RUGEN: Your Princess is really a winning creature . A trifle simple , perhaps , but her appeal is undeniable .
HUMPERDINCK: Oh , I know . The people are quite taken with her . It 's odd , but when I hired Vizzini to have he murdered on our engagement day , I thought that was clever . But it 's going to be so much more moving when I strangle her on ou wedding night . Once Guilder is lamed , the nation will be truly outraged . They 'll demand we go to war .
RUGEN: Now , where is that secret knot ? It 's impossible to find . Are you coming down into the Pit ? Westley 's got his strength back . I am starting him on The Machine tonight .
HUMPERDINCK: Tyrone , you know how much I love watching you work . But , I 've got my country 's five hundredth anniversary to plan , my wedding to arrange , My wife to murder , and Guilder to frame for it . I 'm swamped .
RUGEN: Get some rest if you have n't got your health , you have n't got anything .
RUGEN: This being our first try , I 'll use the lowest setting . And he turns the dial to `` 1 '' .
RUGEN: As you know , the concept of the suction pump is centuries old . Well , really , that 's all this is . Except that instead of sucking water , I 'm sucking life . I 've just sucked one year of your life away . I might one day go as high as five , but I really do n't know what that would do to you . So , let 's just start with what we have . What did this do to you ? Tell me . And remember , this is for posterity , so be honest how do you feel ?
RUGEN: Interesting .
YELLIN: Sire .
HUMPERDINCK: As Chief Enforcer of all Florin , I trust you with this secret killers from Guilder are infiltrating the Thieves ' Forest and plan to murder my bride on our wedding night .
YELLIN: My spy network has heard no such news .
HUMPERDINCK: Too soon , my angel . Patience .
BUTTERCUP: He will come for me .
HUMPERDINCK: Of course . As she glides out
YELLIN: Many of the thieves will resist . My regular enforcers will be inadequate .
HUMPERDINCK: Form a Brute Squad then . I want the Thieves ' Forest emptied efore I wed .
YELLIN: It wo n't be easy , Sire .
HUMPERDINCK: Try ruling the world sometime .
GRANDFATHER: The day of the wedding arrived . The Brute Squad had their hands full carrying out Humperdinck 's orders .
YELLIN: Is everybody out ?
ASSISTANT BRUTE: Almost . There 's a Spaniard giving us some trouble .
YELLIN: Well , you give him some trouble . Move ! And his wagon starts , and as it does ,
ASSISTANT BRUTE: Ho there .
INIGO: I do not budge . Keep your `` Ho there . '' He waves his sword dangerously .
ASSISTANT BRUTE: But the Prince gave orders
INIGO: So did Vizzini when a jo went wrong , you went back to the eginning . And this is where we got the job . So it 's the eginning , and I 'm staying till Vizzini comes .
ASSISTANT BRUTE: You ! Brute ! Come here .
INIGO: I am waiting for Vizzini
VOICE: You surely are a meanie .
FEZZIK: Hello .
INIGO: It 's you .
FEZZIK: True !
INIGO: Perhaps not . I feel fine .
FEZZIK: Yeah ?
GRANDFATHER: FEZZIK and Inigo were reunited . And as FEZZIK nursed his inebriated friend back to health , he told Inigo of Vizzini 's death and the existence of Count Rugen , the sixfingered man . Considering Inigo 's lifelong search , he handled the news surprisingly well . And he faints again into his stew .
INIGO: That 's enough . That 's enough ! Where is this Rugen so I may kill him ?
FEZZIK: He 's with the Prince in the Castle . But the castle gate is guarded by thirty men .
INIGO: How many could you handle ?
FEZZIK: I do n't think more than ten .
INIGO: That leaves twenty for me . At my est , I could never defeat that many . I need Vizzini to plan . I have no gift for strategy .
FEZZIK: But Vizzini 's dead .
INIGO: No not Vizzini I need the Man in Black
FEZZIK: what ?
INIGO: look , he bested you with strength , your greatness . He ested me with steel . He must have outthought Vizzini , and a man who can do that can plan my castle 's onslaught any day . Let 's go
FEZZIK: where ?
INIGO: To find the Man in Black , obviously .
FEZZIK: But you do n't know where he is .
INIGO: Do n't bother me with trifles ; after twenty years , at last , my father 's soul will be at peace .
HUMPERDINCK: Rise and report .
YELLIN: The Thieves ' Forest is emptied . Thirty men guard the castle gate .
HUMPERDINCK: Double it . My Princess must be safe .
YELLIN: The gate has but one key , and I carry that .
HUMPERDINCK: Ah ! My dulcet darling . Tonight we marry . Tomorrow morning , your men will escort us to Florin Channel where every ship in my armada waits to accompany us on ou honeymoon .
BUTTERCUP: Every ship but your four fastest , you mean . The Prince looks at her blankly for a moment .
HUMPERDINCK: Yes . Yes , of course . Naturally , not those four .
YELLIN: Your Majesties .
HUMPERDINCK: You 're a silly girl .
BUTTERCUP: Yes , I am a silly girl , for not having seen sooner that you were nothing but a coward with a heart full of fear .
HUMPERDINCK: I-would-not-say-such things-if- Iwere-you-
BUTTERCUP: Why not ? You ca n't hurt me . Westley and I are joined by the onds of love . And you can not track that . Not with a thousand loodhounds . And you can not break it . Not with a thousand swords . And when I say you are a coward , that is only because you are the slimiest weakling ever to crawl the earth .
RUGEN: Not to fifty ! ! ! But it 's too late as we
FEZZIK: The Man in Black ?
INIGO: His true love is marrying anothe tonight , so who else has cause for Ultimate Suffering ? Excuse me It 's too crowded .
FEZZIK: Everybody MOVE ! !
INIGO: Thank you .
FEZZIK: I 'm sorry , Inigo . I did n't mean to jog him so hard . Inigo ?
FEZZIK: He 's dead .
INIGO: It just is not fair .
THE KID: Grandpa , Grandpa wait
GRANDFATHER: You want me to read this or not ?
THE KID: Who gets Humperdinck ?
GRANDFATHER: I do n't understand .
THE KID: Who kills Prince Humperdinck ? At the end , somebody 's got to do it . Is it Inigo ? Who ?
GRANDFATHER: Nobody . Nobody kills him . He lives .
THE KID: You mean he wins ? Jesus , Grandpa ! What did you read me this thing for ? And he desperately fights for control .
GRANDFATHER: You know , you 've been very sick and you 're taking this story very seriously . I think we better stop now . He closes the book and starts to get up .
THE KID: No ! I 'm okay . I 'm okay . sit down . All right ?
GRANDFATHER: Okay . All right , now , let 's see . Where were we ? Oh yes . In the Pit of Despair .
INIGO: Well , we Montoyas have neve taken defeat easily . Come along , Fezzik . Bring the body .
FEZZIK: The body ?
INIGO: Have you any money ?
FEZZIK: I have a little .
INIGO: I just hope it 's enough to buy a miracle , that 's all .
MIRACLE MAX: What ? What ?
INIGO: Are you the Miracle Max who worked for the King all those years ?
MIRACLE MAX: The King 's stinking son fired me . And thank you so much for bringing up such a painful subject . While you 're at it , why do n't you give me a nice paper cut and pou lemon juice on it ? We 're closed ! He shuts the window . They rap on the door .
FEZZIK: I 'm on the Brute Squad .
MIRACLE MAX: You are the Brute Squad .
INIGO: We need a miracle . It 's very important .
MIRACLE MAX: Look , I 'm retired . And besides , why would you want someone the King 's stinking son fired ? I might kill whoever you wanted me to miracle .
INIGO: He 's already dead .
MIRACLE MAX: He is , eh ? I 'll take a look . Bring him in . He unlocks the door and lets them in .
INIGO: Sir . Sir .
MIRACLE MAX: Hah ?
INIGO: We 're really in a terrible rush .
MIRACLE MAX: Do n't rush me , sonny . You rush a miracle man , you get rotten miracles . You got money ?
INIGO: Sixty-five .
MIRACLE MAX: Sheesh ! I never worked for so little , except once , and that was a very noble cause .
INIGO: This is noble , sir . His wife is crippled . His children are on the brink of starvation .
MIRACLE MAX: Are you a rotten liar .
INIGO: I need him to help avenge my father , murdered these twenty years .
MIRACLE MAX: Your first story was better . Where 's that bellows ? He probably owes you money , huh ? Well , I 'll ask him . He goes to get a huge bellows .
INIGO: He 's dead . He ca n't talk .
MIRACLE MAX: Look who knows so much . Well , it just so happens that your friend here is only mostly dead . There 's a big difference between mostly dead and all dead . Please open his mouth .
INIGO: What 's that ? He stops pumping .
MIRACLE MAX: Go through his clothes and look for loose change .
WESTLEY: tr oooo . luv
INIGO: True love . You heard him . You could not ask for a more noble cause than that .
MIRACLE MAX: Sonny , true love is the greatest thing in the world . Except for a nice MLT , a mutton , lettuce and tomato sandwich , where the mutton is nice and lean and the tomato is ripe . They 're so perky , I love that . But that 's not what he said . He distinctly said `` to blave . '' And , as we all know , `` to blave '' means `` to bluff . '' So you 're probably playing cards , and he cheated
VALERIE: I 'm not a witch , I 'm your wife . But after what you just said , I 'm not even sure I want to be that anymore .
MIRACLE MAX: You never had it so good .
VALERIE: `` True love . '' He said , `` true love , '' Max . My God
MIRACLE MAX: Do n't say another word , Valerie .
VALERIE: He 's afraid . Ever since Prince Humperdinck fired him , his confidence is shattered .
MIRACLE MAX: Why 'd you say that name you promised me that you would neve say that name
VALERIE: What , Humperdinck ? Humperdinck . Humperdinck . Ooo-ooo , Humperdinck
MIRACLE MAX: I 'm not listening .
VALERIE: A life expiring and you do n't have the decency to say why you wo n't help
MIRACLE MAX: Nobody 's hearing nothing !
VALERIE: Humperdinck . Humperdinck ! Humperdinck !
INIGO: But this is Buttercup 's true love If you heal him , he will stop Humperdinck 's wedding .
VALERIE: Humperdinck . Humperdinck
MIRACLE MAX: Shut up Wait . Wait . I make him better , Humperdinck suffers ?
INIGO: Humiliations galore !
MIRACLE MAX: That is a noble cause . Give me the sixty-five , I 'm on the job . And as Valerie shrieks excitedly we
INIGO: That 's a miracle pill ? Max nods .
VALERIE: The chocolate coating makes it go down easier . But you have to wait fifteen minutes for full potency . And you should n't go swimming after , for at least , what ?
MIRACLE MAX: An hour .
VALERIE: Yeah , an hour .
MIRACLE MAX: A good hour . Yeah .
INIGO: Thank you for everything .
MIRACLE MAX: Okay .
VALERIE: Bye-bye , boys .
MIRACLE MAX: Have fun storming the castle .
VALERIE: Think it 'll work ?
MIRACLE MAX: It would take a miracle . Bye !
VALERIE: Bye . And as they wave , trying to look happy we
FEZZIK: Inigo there 's more than thirty
INIGO: What 's the difference ? We 've got him . Help me here . We 'll have to force feed him .
FEZZIK: Has it been fifteen minutes ?
INIGO: We ca n't wait the wedding 's in half an hour and we must strike in the hustle and the bustle eforehand .
FEZZIK: How long do we have to wait efore we know if the miracle works ?
WESTLEY: I 'll beat you both apart . I 'll take you both together .
FEZZIK: Guess not very long .
WESTLEY: Why wo n't my arms move ?
FEZZIK: You 've been mostly dead all day .
INIGO: We had Miracle Max make a pill to ing you back .
WESTLEY: Who are you ? Are we enemies ? Why am I on this wall ? Where 's Buttercup ?
INIGO: Let me explain No , there is too much . Let me sum up .
WESTLEY: That does n't leave much time fo dilly dallying .
FEZZIK: You 've just wiggled your finger . That 's wonderful .
WESTLEY: I 've always been a quick healer . What are our liabilities ?
INIGO: There is but one working castle gate .
WESTLEY: And our assets ?
INIGO: Your brains , Fezzik 's strength , my steel .
FEZZIK: You just shook your head that does n't make you happy ?
WESTLEY: My brains , his steel , and you strength against sixty men , and you think a little head jiggle is supposed to make me happy ? I mean , if we only had a wheelbarrow , that would be something .
INIGO: Where did we put that wheelbarrow the Albino had ?
FEZZIK: Over the Albino , I think .
WESTLEY: Well , why did n't you list that among our assets in the first place ? What I would n't give for a holocaust cloak .
INIGO: There we can not help you .
FEZZIK: Will this do ?
INIGO: Where did you get that ?
FEZZIK: At Miracle Max 's . It fit so nice , he said I could keep it .
WESTLEY: All right , all right . Come on , help me up . Inigo and Fezzik do .
INIGO: Why ? You ca n't even lift one .
WESTLEY: True , but that 's hardly common knowledge , is it ? Thank you . Now , there may be problems once we 're inside .
INIGO: I 'll say how do I find the Count ? Once I do , how do I find you again ? Once I find you again , how do we escape ?
FEZZIK: Do n't pester him , he 's had a hard day .
INIGO: Right , right , sorry .
FEZZIK: Inigo .
INIGO: What ?
FEZZIK: I hope we win
HUMPERDINCK: You do n't seem excited , my little muffin .
BUTTERCUP: Should I be ?
HUMPERDINCK: Brides often are , I 'm told .
BUTTERCUP: I do not marry tonight .
IMPRESSIVE CLERGYMAN: Mawidgemawidge is what bwings us togewer today He has an impediment that would stop a clock .
YELLIN: Stand your ground , men . Stand your ground .
INIGO: Now ?
WESTLEY: Not yet .
INIGO: Now ?
WESTLEY: Light him .
IMPRESSIVE CLERGYMAN: Ven wuv , twoo wuv , wiw fowwow you fowever..
IMPRESSIVE CLERGYMAN: so tweasuwe your vruv..
HUMPERDINCK: Skip to the end .
IMPRESSIVE CLERGYMAN: Have you the wing ?
BUTTERCUP: Here comes my Westley now .
WESTLEY: FEZZIK , the portcullis .
HUMPERDINCK: Your Westley is dead . Buttercup only smiles , shakes her head .
BUTTERCUP: Then why is there fear behind your eyes ?
WESTLEY: Give us the gate key .
YELLIN: I have no gate key .
INIGO: Fezzik , tear his arms off .
YELLIN: Oh , you mean this gate key . And he whips it out , hands it to Fezzik .
IMPRESSIVE CLERGYMAN: And do you , Pwincess Buwwercwup
HUMPERDINCK: Man and wife say man and wife
IMPRESSIVE CLERGYMAN: Man and wife .
HUMPERDINCK: Escort the bride to the Honeymoon Suite I 'll be there shortly . And as he dashes off
RUGEN: Kill the dark one and the giant , ut leave the third fo questioning . And as his Warriors attack
INIGO: Hello . My name is Inigo Montoya . You killed my father . Prepare to die .
FEZZIK: I ca n't leave him alone .
FEZZIK: I 'll be right back .
KING: Strange wedding .
QUEEN: Yes . A very strange wedding . Come along .
KING: What was that for ?
BUTTERCUP: Because you 've always been so kind to me . And I wo n't be seeing you again since I 'm killing myself once we reach the Honeymoon Suite .
KING: Wo n't that be nice ? She kissed me And on those words
RUGEN: You must be that little Spanish at I taught a lesson to all those years ago . It 's simply incredible . Have you been chasing me your whole life only to fail now ? I think that 's the worst thing I ever heard . How marvelous . Inigo sinks .
WESTLEY: There 's a shortage of perfect easts in this world . It would e a pity to damage yours . And Buttercup whirls as we
BUTTERCUP: Oh , Westley , darling . Westley , why wo n't you hold me ?
WESTLEY: Gently .
BUTTERCUP: At a time like this that 's all you can think to say ? `` Gently ? ''
WESTLEY: Gently ! !
RUGEN: Good heavens . Are you still trying to win ?
INIGO: Hello . My name is Inigo Montoya . You killed my father . Prepare to die .
RUGEN: Stop saying that !
RUGEN: No
INIGO: offer me money
RUGEN: yes
INIGO: power too promise me that
RUGEN: all that I have and more please
INIGO: offer me everything I ask for
RUGEN: anything you want
BUTTERCUP: Oh , Westley , will you eve forgive me ?
WESTLEY: What hideous sin have you committed lately ?
BUTTERCUP: I got married . I did n't want to . It all happened so fast .
WESTLEY: It never happened .
BUTTERCUP: What ?
WESTLEY: It never happened .
BUTTERCUP: But it did . I was there . This old man said , `` Man and wife . ''
WESTLEY: Did you say , `` I do '' ?
BUTTERCUP: Well , no , we sort of skipped that part .
WESTLEY: Then you 're not married if you did n't say it , you did n't do it would n't you agree , You Highness ?
WESTLEY: No . To the pain .
HUMPERDINCK: I do n't think I 'm quite familia with that phrase .
WESTLEY: I 'll explain . And I 'll use small words so that you 'll be sure to understand , you wart-hog-faced uffoon .
HUMPERDINCK: That may be the first time in my life a man has dared insult me .
WESTLEY: I was n't finished the next thing you lose will be your left eye , followed by your right
HUMPERDINCK: and then my ears , I understand . Let 's get on with it
WESTLEY: Wrong ! Your ears you keep , and I 'll tell you why
WESTLEY: so that every shriek of every child at seeing your hideousness will be yours to cherish every abe that weeps at your approach , every woman who cries out , `` Dea God , what is that thing ? '' will echo in your perfect ears .
WESTLEY: Have a seat .
WESTLEY: I thought he was with you .
INIGO: No .
WESTLEY: In that case his balance betrays him .
INIGO: Help him .
BUTTERCUP: Why does Westley need helping ?
INIGO: Because he has no strength
INIGO: Shall I dispatch him for you ?
WESTLEY: Thank you , but no whateve happens to us , I want him to live a long life alone with his cowardice .
FEZZIK: Inigo ! Inigo , where are you ?
INIGO: FEZZIK , you did something right .
FEZZIK: Do n't worry I wo n't let it go to my head . And as he holds out his great arms
INIGO: You know , it 's very strange I have been in the revenge business so long , now that it 's over , I do n't know what to do with the est of my life .
WESTLEY: Have you ever considered piracy ? You 'd make a wonderful Dread Pirate Roberts . Now from that
GRANDFATHER: They rode to freedom . And as dawn arose , Westley and Buttercup knew they were safe . A wave of love swept over them . And as they eached for each other
THE KID: What ? What ?
GRANDFATHER: No , it 's kissing again . You do n't want to hear it .
THE KID: I do n't mind so much . He gestures for his Grandfather to read .
GRANDFATHER: Okay .
THE KID: Okay .
GRANDFATHER: Okay . Okay . Okay . All right . So long .
THE KID: Grandpa ? The Old Man stops , turns .
GRANDFATHER: As you wish
WATSON'S VOICE: Somewhere in the vaults of a bank in London is a tin dispatch box with my name on it . It is not to be opened until fifty years after my death .
MRS. HUDSON: I do wish you 'd give me a little more warning when you come home unexpected . I would have roasted a goose and had some flowers for you .
HOLMES: My dear Mrs. Hudson criminals are as unpredictable as head-colds . You neve quite know when you 're going to catch one .
MRS. HUDSON: I 'll unpack your bags .
WATSON: Here 's an advance copy of Strand Magazine . They 've printed 'The Red-Headed League ! '
HOLMES: Very impressive .
WATSON: Would you like to see how I treated it ?
HOLMES: I can hardly wait . I 'm sure I 'll find out all sorts of fascinating things about the case that I never knew before .
WATSON: Just what do you mean by that ?
HOLMES: Oh , come now , Watson , you must admit that you have a tendency to over-romanticize . You have taken my simple exercises in logic and embellished them , exaggerated them
WATSON: I deny the accusation .
HOLMES: You have described me as six-foot-four , whereas I am barely six-foot-one .
WATSON: A bit of poetic license .
HOLMES: You have saddled me with this improbable costume , which the public now expects me to wear .
WATSON: That 's not my doing . Blame it on the illustrator .
HOLMES: You 've made me out to be a violin virtuoso . Here
WATSON: Oh , really ?
HOLMES: The fact is that I could barely hold my own in the pit orchestra of a second-rate music hall .
WATSON: You 're much too modest .
HOLMES: You have given the reader the distinct impression that I am a misogynist . Actually , I do n't dislike women I merely distrust them . The twinkle in the eye and the arsenic in the soup .
WATSON: It 's those little touches that make you colorful
HOLMES: Lurid is more like it . You have painted me as a hopeless dope addict just ecause I occasionally take a five pe cent solution of cocaine .
WATSON: A seven per cent solution .
HOLMES: Five per cent . Do n't you think I 'm aware you 've been diluting it behind my back ?
WATSON: As a doctor and as your friend I strongly disapprove of this insidious habit of yours .
HOLMES: My dear friend as well as my dea doctor I only resort to narcotics when I am suffering from acute boredom when there are no interesting cases to engage my mind . Look at this an urgent appeal to find six missing midgets . He tosses the letter down is disgust .
WATSON: Did you say midgets ? He picks up the letter .
HOLMES: Six of them the Tumbling Piccolos an acrobatic act with some circus .
WATSON: Disappeared between London and Bristol Do n't you find that intriguing ?
HOLMES: Extremely so . You see , they are not only midgets but also anarchists .
WATSON: Anarchists ?
HOLMES: By now they have been smuggled to Vienna , dressed as little girls in burgundy pinafores . They are to greet the Czar of all the Russias when he arrives at the ailway station . They will be carrying ouquets of flowers , concealed in each ouquet will be a bomb with a lit fuse .
WATSON: You really think so ?
HOLMES: Not at all . The circus owner offers me five pounds for my services that 's not even a pound a midget .
WATSON: Oh . And it sounded so promising
HOLMES: There are no great crimes anymore , Watson . The criminal class has lost all enterprise and originality . At best they commit some bungling villainy , with a motive so transparent that even a Scotland Yard official can see through it .
MRS. HUDSON: Yes ? What is it ? What have I done now ?
HOLMES: There is something missing from my desk .
MRS. HUDSON: Missing ?
HOLMES: Something very crucial . You have been tidying up against my explicit orders .
MRS. HUDSON: Oh , I made sure not to disturb anything .
HOLMES: Dust , Mrs. Hudson , is an essential part of my filing system . By the thickness of it , I can date any document immediately .
MRS. HUDSON: Some of the dust was this thick .
HOLMES: That would be March , 1883 . He blows the feather away .
MRS. HUDSON: How can you stand this ? Why do n't you let me air the room out ?
WATSON: Please , Mrs. Hudson he 's working on a definitive study of tobacco ash .
MRS. HUDSON: I 'm sure there 's a crying need for that .
WATSON: In our endeavors , it is sometimes vital to distinguish between , say , the ashes of a Macedonian cigarette and a Jamaican cigar . Sor far he has classified 140 different kinds of ashes .
MRS. HUDSON: All of which will end up on my rug .
WATSON: That 'll be enough , Mrs. Hudson .
MRS. HUDSON: All right . If you gentlemen want to stay here and suffocate
HOLMES: She 's right . I am suffocating .
WATSON: Let me open a window .
HOLMES: Not from lack of air from lack of activity . Sitting here week after week lowing smoke rings staring through a microscope there 's no challenge in that .
WATSON: Personally , I consider it a majo contribution to scientific criminology
HOLMES: How I envy you your mind , Watson .
WATSON: You do ?
HOLMES: It 's placid , imperturbable , prosaic . But my mind rebels against stagnation . It 's like a racing engine , tearing itself to pieces because it 's not connected up with the work for which it was built .
WATSON: Holmes
HOLMES: Fair question .
WATSON: Are n't you ashamed of yourself ?
HOLMES: Thoroughly . But this will take care of it .
WATSON'S VOICE: Naturally , I do n't mean to imply that my friend was always on cocaine sometimes it was opium , sometimes it was hashish . And once he went one of these dreadful inges , there was no telling how long it would last .
WATSON: The only reason you moved in with me is to have a steady supply of stimulants .
HOLMES: Now , now , Watson you must n't underestimate your other charms . He starts into the bedroom .
WATSON: Holmes , I warn you . If you lock yourself in there once more
HOLMES: I intend to do nothing of the sort .
MRS. HUDSON: I made you some tea and cress sandwiches .
WATSON: Mrs. Hudson , I want you to pack my bags .
MRS. HUDSON: Are you going away for the weekend ?
WATSON: And beyond . I 'm moving out .
MRS. HUDSON: Moving out ?
HOLMES: I 'm just as surprised as you are .
WATSON: You heard me , Mrs. Hudson . And let 's not waste any time .
HOLMES: May I be so bold as to ask where you ' e going ?
WATSON: I do n't know yet . But I intend to resume my practice . I am , after all , a doctor . And quite a competent one , if I say so as should n't .
HOLMES: You 'll find it very dull snipping out tonsils and flushing out kidneys
WATSON: I will , of course , continue to pay my half of the rent until you find someone to share these rooms with you .
HOLMES: Where am I going to find anyone who will put up with my rather eccentric habits ?
WATSON: Here 's a fresh needle and here 's my farewell present to you .
HOLMES: Watson
MRS. HUDSON: It 's so sad . You and Mr. Holmes afte all these years
WATSON: Please , Mrs. Hudson none of that .
MRS. HUDSON: I 'll wash this and send it on to you .
WATSON: I 'll be at Brown 's Hotel .
MRS. HUDSON: I know how it feels I once went through a divorce myself .
WATSON: Actually , I 'm rather looking forward to it . Leading a normal life again . Regular office hours nine to three and if occasionally there 's an emergency call in the middle of the night , I know it 's going be appendicitis and not an ax murder . Let Holmes go mucking about in the fog and the sleet , looking for a loodstained collar-button out on the moors , with some demented hound snapping at his behind
MRS. HUDSON: Mr. Holmes
HOLMES: Please , Mrs. Hudson . You 're in my line of fire .
MRS. HUDSON: How many times have I told you I will not tolerate pistol practice on my premises ? I should have evicted you when you shot them holes in my wall .
HOLMES: Merely celebrating Her Majesty 's Golden Jubilee .
MRS. HUDSON: Look at that mess you made
WATSON: It 's all right , Mrs. Hudson . I 'll clean it up while you unpack my things .
MRS. HUDSON: Unpack ?
HOLMES: You heard him .
WATSON: Thank you , Holmes . I know how difficult it must 've been for you
HOLMES: Not really . It was simple choice between a bad habit and a good companion .
WATSON: You 've made me very happy .
HOLMES: I 've often been accused of being cold and unemotional . I admit to it . And yet , in my cold , unemotional way , I 'm very fond of you , Watson .
WATSON: I know that . But one likes to hear these things occasionally .
HOLMES: I 'll do it .
WATSON: For a moment , I was worried that you were going to let me walk out that you were n't even going to try to stop me .
HOLMES: Now , Watson you know there 's nothing I would n't do to keep you here .
WATSON'S VOICE: It was not the first not the last time he tricked me like that . Normally , I was inclined to forgive him
WATSON: Why are you being so stubborn , Holmes ? Why wo n't you go ? It 's the final performance of the Imperial Russian Ballet the house has been sold out fo months He moves towards the door of
HOLMES: That 's precisely it . Why should someone send up two free tickets ? Anonymously , at that .
WATSON: Whoever sent them must be in great distress . The note says
HOLMES: I suspect it 's some sort of plot .
WATSON: You mean somebody wants to lure us into a trap ?
HOLMES: Somebody wants to kill me .
WATSON: Kill you ?
HOLMES: That 's right . It 's a plot to bore me to death . I detest ballet .
WATSON: But this is n't just any ballet . It 's Swan Lake .
HOLMES: H'mmmm .
WATSON: Fabulous woman , do n't you think so , Holmes ?
HOLMES: Who ?
WATSON: The great Petrova .
HOLMES: Very strong arches , I must admit .
WATSON: They say twelve men have died for her .
HOLMES: Really .
WATSON: Six committed suicide , four were killed in duels , and one fell out of the gallery in the Vienna Opera House .
HOLMES: That 's only eleven .
WATSON: The man who fell from the gallery landed on top of another man in the orchestra .
HOLMES: That makes an even dozen in a messy sort of way .
ROGOZHIN: Mister Holmes ?
HOLMES: Yes .
ROGOZHIN: I am Nicolai Rogozhin , director-general of the Imperial Russian Ballet . So glad you accept invitation .
HOLMES: This is Dr. Watson .
ROGOZHIN: Pleased to meet you . You are enjoying ?
WATSON: Immensely .
ROGOZHIN: Tell me , Mr. Holmes , how is your health ?
HOLMES: My health ? Better consult my doctor .
WATSON: Oh , he 's in excellent shape .
ROGOZHIN: Any insanity in your family ? Diabetes ? Asthma ?
HOLMES: Would you mind telling me what this is all about ?
ROGOZHIN: Certainly . Madame Petrova , she has problem .
HOLMES: Could you be more specific ?
ROGOZHIN: Certainly not .
WATSON: A liason with a crowned head ? Compromising letters ? Blackmail ? He glances toward the stage .
ROGOZHIN: After performance , there will be little celebration backstage and Madame equests your presence .
WATSON: We 'd be delighted .
ROGOZHIN: You are invited , also .
ROGOZHIN: There you are , Mr. Holmes . Madame is expecting you in her dressing room . Dr. Watson , you will amuse yourself meanwhile we have vodka , caviar , girls .
WATSON: No , thank you .
ROGOZHIN: No girls ?
WATSON: No caviar . Makes me break out in hives .
ROGOZHIN: Dievushki . Siude , siuda , dievushki . Posnakomtes s docktorum Watsonom .
WATSON: Any of you girls understand English ?
GIRLS: Nyet .
WATSON: Not one single word ?
GIRLS: Nyet .
WATSON: In that case , I do n't mind telling you that you all have lovely po-pos . He pats a couple of the po-pos with his cane .
ROGOZHIN: Mr. Holmes , I must prepare you this is no ordinary case .
HOLMES: It is only the extraordinary that interests me .
ROGOZHIN: Good . Because you will find this extra- extraordinary .
MAID: Pozhaluista voidite .
ROGOZHIN: Ja priviol vam Mistera Sherlock Holmesa , doragaia .
PETROVA: Otchen rada . She extends her hand , and Holmes takes it .
HOLMES: Madame .
PETROVA: Vi menshe rostom chem ja ozhidala .
HOLMES: Madame says you are shorter than she thought .
PETROVA: No eto nie vazhno . Menia interessujut glavnim obra som vashi mosghi .
ROGOZHIN: Short , tall , who cares ? It is the brains that count .
HOLMES: Thank you . Thank you . Petrova rises , crosses to the paravent .
PETROVA: Ja prochia vsie vashi prikliuchenia . Zamiechatelno ! Os sobenno sobaka Baskervillei .
ROGOZHIN: Madame is great admirer of yours . She has read every story her favorite is Big Dog from Baskerville .
HOLMES: I 'm afraid it loses something in translation .
PETROVA: Nikolai , pokazhite iemu skripku . Rogozhin picks up a violin case , opens it .
ROGOZHIN: Mr. Holmes , you know about fiddles . What is your opinion of this ?
HOLMES: 'Antonius Stradivarius Cremonesis , Anno 1709 . ' Well , the label is authentic . Judging from the shape , the color of the varnish , and the tone , I would say it is a genuine Stradivarius of the best period .
ROGOZHIN: You like ?
HOLMES: It 's magnificent .
PETROVA: Skazhite jemu chto eto podarok ot menia .
ROGOZHIN: Here take it . Madame says it is yours .
HOLMES: Mine ?
ROGOZHIN: For services you will render .
HOLMES: My fees as a detective are not exactly trifling but a Stradivarius you 're not serious .
ROGOZHIN: I am not . But Madame is .
PETROVA: Nalejte vodki i obiasnite jemu v chom dielo . She drapes herself on the chaise .
ROGOZHIN: All right . I will pour vodka and explain . Mr. Holmes , what you have seen tonight is last and positively final performance of Madame Petrova . She is retiring .
HOLMES: What a shame .
ROGOZHIN: She has been dancing since she was three years old . And after all , she is now thirty-eight .
HOLMES: I must say she does n't look thirty-eight .
ROGOZHIN: That is because she is forty-nine . So Madame has decided to leave ballet and spend life bringing up her child .
HOLMES: How admirable .
ROGOZHIN: Problem now is to find father .
HOLMES: Oh ? Is he missing ?
ROGOZHIN: Correct .
HOLMES: And that 's why you called me in ?
ROGOZHIN: Also correct . We must have father , ecause without father , how can there be child ?
HOLMES: I see . The whole thing is still in the planning stage
ROGOZHIN: Correct again . Madame would like child to be brilliant and beautiful . Since she is beautiful she now needs man who is illiant .
PETROVA: Za zdorovie .
ROGOZHIN: Za zdorovie .
HOLMES: Za zdrovie .
ROGOZHIN: What does it taste like ?
HOLMES: Red pepper .
ROGOZHIN: That 's what 's in it .
PETROVA: Kogda mi smozhem dvinutsa v putj ?
HOLMES: I beg your pardon ?
ROGOZHIN: Madame wants to know how soon you can be eady .
HOLMES: Ready ?
ROGOZHIN: To leave for Venice . All arrangements have been made . You will spend one week there with Madame
HOLMES: Well , this is all very flattering . But surely there are other me better men
ROGOZHIN: To tell you truth , you were not first choice . We considered Russian writer , Tolstoi
HOLMES: That 's more like it . The man 's a genius .
ROGOZHIN: Too old Then we considered the philosopher , Nietzsche
HOLMES: Absolutely first-rate mind
ROGOZHIN: Too German And we considered Tschaikowski
HOLMES: Oh , you could n't go wrong with Tschaikowski
ROGOZHIN: We could and we did . It was catastrophe .
HOLMES: Why ?
ROGOZHIN: You do n't know ? Because Tschaikowski how shall put it ? Women not his glass of tea .
HOLMES: Pity , that .
PETROVA: Skazhite jemu chto je otchen dovolna etim esheniem .
ROGOZHIN: Madame is very happy with final choice .
HOLMES: Madame must n't be too hasty . She must emember I 'm an Englishman .
ROGOZHIN: So ?
HOLMES: You know what they say about us . If there 's one thing more deplorable than our cooking , it 's our love-making . We are not exactly the most romantic of people
ROGOZHIN: Perfect . We do n't want sentimental idiots falling in love , committing suicide . One week in Venice she goes ack to St. Petersburg with baby you go back to London with fiddle .
HOLMES: An equitable arrangement . About my medical history when you asked me I neglected to mention a small detail . There is hemophilia in my family . We 're all bleeders .
ROGOZHIN: On govorit , chto v jevo semie stradajut ghemofilijei .
PETROVA: Pust nie bezpokoitsa . Ja ostrighu sebe noghti .
ROGOZHIN: Madame says not to worry . She will not scratch you .
HOLMES: That 's reassuring to know . But
PETROVA: Pochemu on kolebletsa ? On nie nahodit menia dostatochno privlekatelnoi ?
ROGOZHIN: Madame says you talk too much . You find her attractive or no ?
WATSON: Excuse me . What does prokanzik mean ?
ROGOZHIN: It means 'You little devil . '
WATSON: It does ? I am ? Thank you . He hurries off , shutting the door .
ROGOZHIN: I repeat question . You find Madame attractive or no ?
HOLMES: Oh , I find her most attractive for a woman , that is .
ROGOZHIN: Then no problem .
HOLMES: Maybe a slight one . You see , I am not a free man .
ROGOZHIN: Not free ? You are a bachelor .
HOLMES: A bachelor living with anothe achelor for the last five years . Five very happy years .
ROGOZHIN: What is it you are trying to tell me ?
HOLMES: I hoped I could avoid the subject . But some of us through a cruel caprice of Mother Nature
ROGOZHIN: Get to point .
HOLMES: The point is that Tschaikowski is not an isolated case .
ROGOZHIN: You mean , you and Dr. Watson ? He is your glass of tea ?
HOLMES: If you want to be picturesque about it .
PETROVA: Chto on govorit ? Pri chom tut Chaikovsky ?
ROGOZHIN: On pederast .
PETROVA: Jescho odin ? Eto stanovitsa odnoobrasno ! Kakoi vi idiot !
HOLMES: Believe me , Madame , the loss is all mine . But I would prefer to disappoint you know than disappoint you in a gondola in Venice .
PETROVA: Potchemu vi nie vijasnili eto eto ranshe , prezhde chem posoritj menia !
HOLMES: Watson ! Watson , are you coming ?
WATSON: What is it , old boy ?
HOLMES: We 're going home .
WATSON: Home ? Not a chance . Not the slightest not the remotest chance . Toodle-ooo .
ROGOZHIN: Why ? Do you not prefer it this way ?
WATSON: What way ?
ROGOZHIN: You do n't have to pretend . Mr. Holmes told us everything about you and him
WATSON: About me and him ?
ROGOZHIN: Come now , no need to be bashful . We are not bourgeois . Maybe with doctors and detectives is unusual but in ballet , is very usual .
WATSON: What is ?
ROGOZHIN: Caprice of Mother Nature . Look at Pavel and Mischa and Boris and Dmitri
WATSON: Holmes !
HOLMES: From the sound of your footsteps , I gathered that you were not in a particularly amiable mood .
WATSON: How could you do a dastardly thing like that to me ? What the deuce were you thinking of ? He dashes the smoking machine to the floor .
HOLMES: Watson , you have my most abject apologies . But have you ever been cornered by a madwoman ? It seemed like the only way to get out of it without hurting her feelings .
WATSON: What about my feelings ? And my eputation ? Do you realize the gravity of what you have done ? The possible epercussions ?
HOLMES: So there 'll be a little gossip about you in St. Petersburg
WATSON: These things spread like wildfire . I can just hear those malicious whispers behind my back . I 'll never be able to show my face in polite society
HOLMES: Watson , you 're running amok .
WATSON: Dishonored , disgraced , ostracized . What am I to do ?
HOLMES: Well , for one thing , I 'd get rid of that flower .
WATSON: You may think this is funny , but we 're oth in the same boat . We must take desperate measures . We must stop this talk Maybe if we got married
HOLMES: Then they 'd really talk
WATSON: Obviously , we can not continue to live under the same roof . We must move apart .
HOLMES: Of course , we can still see each othe clandestinely on remote benches in Hyde Park , and in the waiting rooms of suburban railway stations
WATSON: The whole thing is ridiculous . We have nothing to hide .
HOLMES: That 's what I 've been trying to tell you .
WATSON: Let somebody start a rumor just one ugly word and we 'll sue them fo slander .
HOLMES: Nobody would dare . After all , you have an enviable record with the fair sex .
WATSON: Damn right . I can get women from three continents to testify for me . And you can get women to vouch for you , too ca n't you , Holmes ?
HOLMES: Good night , Watson . He starts toward his bedroom .
WATSON: Holmes , let me ask you a question I hope I 'm not being presumptuous but there have been women in your life ?
HOLMES: The answer is yes . You 're being presumptuous . Good night .
WATSON: Holmes
WATSON'S VOICE: What , indeed , was his attitude toward women ? Was there some secret he was holding back or was he just a thinking machine , incapable of any emotion ?
WATSON: Were you expecting someone ?
HOLMES: Not at this hour .
WATSON: Maybe Mrs. Hudson is entertaining .
HOLMES: I never found her so .
WATSON: What is it , Mrs. Hudson ?
MRS. HUDSON: There 's a cabbie here he says you owe him two-and-six .
WATSON: For what ?
CABBIE: For the fare , guv'nor . The young lady does n't have any money .
WATSON: What young lady ?
CABBIE: This one .
WATSON: Well . What have we here ? Who are you , miss ? What happened to you ?
GABRIELLE: I do n't know .
CABBIE: That 's all she keeps saying I do n't know , I do n't know .
WATSON: Where did she come from ?
CABBIE: From the river . I was driving down the Embankment , just below Westminste Bridge , and there she was in the water drowning .
HOLMES: Why did you bring her here ?
CABBIE: Because I found this in her hand 221B Baker Street that 's right , is n't it ? Watson examines the cardboard , nods .
HOLMES: Young lady what did you want at this address ?
GABRIELLE: I do not remember .
WATSON: Rather perplexing , would n't you say ?
HOLMES: Rather .
CABBIE: Well , gentlemen , you want her ? it 's two-and-six or shall I throw her back in the river ?
MRS. HUDSON: Mr. Holmes . You ca n't let him
HOLMES: Watson , you 'd better accept delivery .
WATSON: Keep the change .
CABBIE: Thank you , guv'nor .
WATSON: You 're shivering , my dear .
HOLMES: There was some printing on the back of this but it seems to have come off in the water .
WATSON: Look at this she 's had a nasty blow on the head .
WATSON: No . The blood has already coagulated . So it would appear that she was the victim of a deliberate attack Get my ag , will you ?
GABRIELLE: Who are you ?
WATSON: I 'm Dr. Watson and this is Mr. Sherlock Holmes . Do the names mean anything to you ?
GABRIELLE: No .
WATSON: Think .
GABRIELLE: I 'm trying .
HOLMES: Can you think of your own name ?
GABRIELLE: No .
WATSON: She 's obviously had a concussion which often leads to temporary amnesia .
HOLMES: So all we know is that she was coshed on the head , dumped into the Thames , and subsequently dumped into our laps .
WATSON: We know a lot more than that . From he accent , we know she is foreign from her ring , we know she is married and there is one other clue we have Something I deduced while I was helping her up the stairs . No corset .
HOLMES: Good work .
GABRIELLE: Non , je ne suis pas Francaise .
WATSON: How can she say she 's not French , in French ?
HOLMES: Vous etes Suisse ?
GABRIELLE: Non .
HOLMES: Alors , vous etes Belge .
GABRIELLE: Je suis pas sure .
HOLMES: Vous etes Belge de Bruxelles !
GABRIELLE: Bruxelles ? Oui Je pense que oui .
MRS. HUDSON: Oh , dash . Will someone remove the violin , please ?
WATSON: We just found out that she 's Belgian .
MRS. HUDSON: Poor thing .
WATSON: From Brussels .
HOLMES: If you do n't mind .
GABRIELLE: I do n't know .
HOLMES: And your husband 's name is Emile ?
GABRIELLE: Emile
HOLMES: Where is he ? What are you doing in London ?
GABRIELLE: I do n't know .
HOLMES: When did you arrive from Brussels ? Where are you staying ?
GABRIELLE: I do n't know .
HOLMES: What happened at the river ? Think ! Pensez ! Concentrez vous ! Gabrielle bursts into sobs .
WATSON: That 's enough , Holmes . I will not permit you to question her in this condition . Mrs. Hudson , put her to bed . My bed . I 'll sleep on the couch .
MRS. HUDSON: Come , my dear .
WATSON: I 'd better mix her a sleeping potion .
HOLMES: Watson , I think we should arrange to have her removed to a hospital .
WATSON: Under no circumstances .
HOLMES: She should have medical attention .
WATSON: She can get that from me . But more importantly , she must be protected there has already been one attempt on he life .
HOLMES: This temporary amnesia how temporary is it ?
WATSON: It depends on the extent of the injury . It 's like veils shrouding her memory . It could clear up in a few days or a few weeks .
HOLMES: Watson , this is a very small flat we do n't want to clutter it up with women
WATSON: Holmes , we 've never had a case like this . A woman comes to us with a problem we do n't know who the woman is and we do n't know what the problem is . Do n't you find that challenging ?
HOLMES: Quite . But we ca n't afford to wait fo those veils to lift we must break through them as quickly as possible .
WATSON: You really feel it 's that urgent ?
HOLMES: I do . The sooner we solve the case , the sooner we can get rid of her .
WATSON: Oh .
GABRIELLE: Emile ? She starts to get out of bed .
HOLMES: Yes , Gabrielle .
GABRIELLE: Ah , Emile . I thought I 'd never find you . Hold me . Hold me tight . It 's been such a long time . So many nights . You know what I did before I left Brussels ?
HOLMES: What ?
GABRIELLE: I hope you wo n't be angry with me . I ought myself an expensive negligee .
HOLMES: Did you ?
GABRIELLE: A pink negligee with maribou feathers . Do n't you think that 's a foolish thing for a married woman ? Come .
HOLMES: Where is the negligee ?
GABRIELLE: In my luggage Come here .
HOLMES: And where is your luggage ?
GABRIELLE: I do n't know . Come , my love . Come . Please .
MRS. HUDSON: Dr. Watson ! Your porridge is getting lumpy . Had n't you better get up ? Watson tries to rise , falls back with a moan .
WATSON: I would like to very much . But Mrs. Hudson , would you mind planting you knee in the small of my back ?
MRS. HUDSON: Yes , I would .
WATSON: Please ! I 'm in excruciating pain .
MRS. HUDSON: Dr. Watson . She 's gone .
WATSON: Gone ?
MRS. HUDSON: Well , I never !
HOLMES: Mmmmm . I smell porridge . Lumpy as usual , I suppose .
WATSON: Oh , there you are , Holmes . We were just wondering how
MRS. HUDSON: We certainly were .
HOLMES: Mrs. Hudson , why do n't you go down to the kitchen get a towel and wipe that look of disapproval off your face .
MRS. HUDSON: Liberties in my house ! She exits huffily .
WATSON: You ca n't really blame her I mean , the way it looks if I did n't know you etter , I might suspect you 'd taken advantage of the young lady .
HOLMES: As a matter of fact , I did take advantage of her Would you hand me the butter- knife , please ?
WATSON: Of course .
HOLMES: Thank you .
WATSON: Holmes , this is reprehensible ! Where are your professional ethics ? Have you no sense of decency , no shame
HOLMES: None whatsoever . If you must know , I found her body quite rewarding .
WATSON: You cad !
HOLMES: Especially the palm of her right hand .
WATSON: I 'd rather not hear about it !
HOLMES: Very well . Then I wo n't bother to tell you how I traced her suitcase .
WATSON: That 's her suitcase ?
HOLMES: Remember that piece of soggy cardboard with our address on it ? It was a luggage ticket the number rubbed off on he hand . And since she must have arrived from Brussels by the boat train , I concluded that she had checked he elongings at Victoria Station .
WATSON: By Jove ! If you 're right , we should find a clue to her identity . Holmes has now forced open the locks .
HOLMES: Or at least a pink negligee with maribou feathers .
WATSON: Let 's see - what else is in here ?
HOLMES: Now we 're getting somewhere .
WATSON: Who do you suppose this is ?
HOLMES: Come in , Madame Valladon . You are Gabrielle Valladon .
GABRIELLE: Yes .
HOLMES: And this is your husband , Emile Valladon ?
GABRIELLE: Yes . Her eyes fall on the open suitcase .
HOLMES: Sorry to have ransacked your valise . But since you came to us for help
GABRIELLE: Where am I ?
WATSON: 221B Baker Street .
GABRIELLE: Oh , yes Which of you is Mr. Holmes and which is Dr. Watson ?
HOLMES: Dr. Watson is the handsome one .
WATSON: Coffee . You want strong coffee . He hurries over to the breakfast table .
GABRIELLE: It 's all so confusing .
HOLMES: Let 's try to sort it out . You came to London looking for your husband
GABRIELLE: Yes . He 's a mining engineer . We were married five years ago , in the Congo .
HOLMES: Where your husband was working in a copper mine .
GABRIELLE: How did you know ?
HOLMES: Your wedding ring it 's made of copper .
GABRIELLE: Last year he invented a new kind of ai pump , and was hired by an English company , Jonah Limited .
WATSON: Here you are .
HOLMES: Jonah Limited . Go on .
GABRIELLE: We 've been writing to each othe egularly . Then suddenly , three weeks ago , his letters stopped . I kept writing but no answer . Finally I decided to go to that address
HOLMES: 32 Ashdown Street .
GABRIELLE: Yes . It 's just an empty store nobody there . Then I tried to find Jonah Limited . No such company exists .
WATSON: How decidedly odd .
HOLMES: Madame Valladon , can you think of any eason why your husband should have lied to you about theses things ?
GABRIELLE: Emile ? Never . He loves me and I love him .
HOLMES: So I gathered .
GABRIELLE: I went to the police they said they would send out a missing persons report ut they did n't sound too encouraging . Then I went to the Belgian embassy and explained the situation to them and they suggested that I consult you
WATSON: You could have done worse .
GABRIELLE: I was on my way here and suddenly there were footsteps behind me and a hand over my mouth and the smell of choloroform and the next thing I knew I was in the water and then a man was wrapping me in a blanket
HOLMES: Madame Valladon , somebody tried to kill you last night . Do you have any idea who could have done it ?
GABRIELLE: I do n't understand any of it . What does it all mean , Mr. Holmes ? Where is my husband ? You must help me find him .
WATSON: We 'll do our best , I assure you .
HOLMES: Madame Valladon , I want you to send one more letter to your husband .
GABRIELLE: 32 . What do you want me to say in the letter ?
HOLMES: Nothing .
WATSON: You 're sending an empty sheet of paper to an empty shop ?
HOLMES: That empty shop is obviously being used as an accomodation address , or letter- drop . But what gets dropped must be picked up . The question is how ? and y whom ? and why ?
WATSON: Here !
GABRIELLE: It 's so strange to think I 've been writing to a place like this all these months .
WATSON: Look at all these canaries . Do you suppose this could have been a pet shop ?
HOLMES: Maybe . Here comes our letter .
GABRIELLE: Mr. Holmes
HOLMES: Yes ?
GABRIELLE: I do n't know how I 'm going to pay you fo all this . The purse with my money is somewhere at the bottom of the Thames .
HOLMES: It could be worse . You could be at the ottom of the Thames much to you discomfort and much to my chagrin .
WATSON: I do n't understand how anybody picks up letters here . No footprints just tracks . What does it mean ?
HOLMES: I would surmise somebody is using ice- skates if it were n't for a conspicuous absence of ice .
WATSON: What do we do now ?
HOLMES: This way .
FIRST CARTER: Morning , Duchess .
SECOND CARTER: What have you been doing with yourself ?
FIRST CARTER: Two dozen .
SECOND CARTER: Look , Duchess , we do n't know and we do n't want to know .
FIRST CARTER: When you work for Jonah , it 's better not to ask questions .
SECOND CARTER: How about that letter ? Does that go , too ?
WATSON: I really thought we were done for .
HOLMES: The art of concealment , my dear Watson , is merely a matter of being in the right place at the right time .
GABRIELLE: Did you hear what she said ? You really think Emile is going to pick up the letter himself ?
HOLMES: It certainly would simplify things , would n't it ?
WATSON: Maildrops and canaries and wheelchairs And what was all that about Jonah ? And what do you suppose they 're doing up there ? And where is up there ?
HOLMES: My guess would be Scotland . Inverness , to be more precise .
WATSON: Inverness ?
HOLMES: Did n't you notice the paper at the bottom of their cage ? The Inverness Courier .
GABRIELLE: Mr. Holmes ! This letter
HOLMES: What about it ?
GABRIELLE: It 's addressed to you .
HOLMES: Nevertheless
HOLMES: Either your watch is wrong , or Mycroft has miscalculated . And knowing Mycroft , I suggest you reset your watch . Watson automatcially obeys .
WATSON: I do n't mind telling you I 'm a bit apprehensive about this .
HOLMES: I 'm rather curious myself as to what is going on in that Machiavellian mind of his .
WATSON: I do n't mean Mycroft , I mean Madame Valladon .
HOLMES: Do n't worry . She 's perfectly safe with Mrs. Hudson . He opens the door and they start in .
PORTER: Right you are . He 's expecting you in the upstairs study . Now if you gentlemen will sign in Surname , Christian name , address , nature of business
HOLMES: Jamaican , no doubt either Tropical o Golosina I 'm not quite sure . He and Watson continue toward the study door .
MYCROFT: Come in , come in , Sherlock Dr. Watson Sit down . You 're looking very fit , both of you .
WATSON: Thank you .
HOLMES: And how are you , Mycroft ? How 's you gout ?
MYCROFT: Under control . Except for the occasional twinge .
WATSON: If you do n't mind my saying so , anybody who 's susceptible to gout should n't be
MYCROFT: The last doctor who warned me about that was crossing Piccadilly , slipped on an orange peel , and was run over by a delivery van from the Fortnum and Mason . Your very good health .
HOLMES: Why are you wasting this precious stuff on us ?
MYCROFT: Well , I see you so rarely . How long has it been ? Not since the case of the Greek interpreter . Is n't it ridiculous ? Two brothers living in the same town
HOLMES: In the same town , perhaps but not the same world .
WATSON: Mmmm . Superb . How old did you say it was ?
MYCROFT: 1814 . One year before Waterloo .
WATSON: One year before Waterloo ? Think of that .
MYCROFT: You do know where Waterloo is , do n't you , Doctor ?
WATSON: Belgium , is n't it ?
MYCROFT: Quite . And speaking of Belgium , it has come to my attention that you are interested in the whereabouts of a certain engineer .
HOLMES: Yes , I am .
MYCROFT: Well , I can save you a lot of trouble .
HOLMES: I 'd be grateful for any suggestion
MYCROFT: My suggestion is that you pursue it no further .
HOLMES: Any particular reason ?
MYCROFT: Because it involves the national security . We are handling this matte ourselves .
WATSON: We ? Who 's we ?
HOLMES: The Diogenes Club , of course .
MYCROFT: I did n't say that .
HOLMES: I have always suspected that there was some underground connection between this stodgy and seemingly calcified establishment and the Foreign Office in Whitehall .
MYCROFT: That 's neither here nor there .
HOLMES: It seems to me that The Diogenes Club is here , there and everywhere . When there are rumblings of revolt in the Sudan , an expedition subsidized by your clu conveniently shows up to study the source of the Nile . When there is trouble along the Indian frontier , some of your fellow members pop up in the Himalayas , alledgedly looking for the Abominable Snowman .
MYCROFT: What a fertile imagination my brothe has . At the age of five , by carefully observing a neighbor 's house , he deduced that babies were brought not y the stork , but by the mid-wife in he satchel .
WATSON: As good an explanation as any .
MYCROFT: Yes , Wiggins ?
YOUNG MAN: An immediate answer is requested , sir .
MYCROFT: Tell them that the three boxes go to Glennahurich , and the red runner goes to the castle .
YOUNG MAN: The three boxes to Glennahurich , the red unner to the castle . Very good , sir .
HOLMES: Why do n't you crumple it up and swallow it to make sure .
MYCROFT: My dear Sherlock , there are certain affairs that do not come within the province of the private detective . They have to be dealt with on an altogethe different level .
HOLMES: In other words , you want me to stay within my limits .
MYCROFT: I do indeed .
HOLMES: Speaking of limits , what exactly is Jonah Limited ?
MYCROFT: Sherlock , when I said drop this case , it was not merely a suggestion it was an order !
HOLMES: By whose authority ?
MYCROFT: By the authority of Her Majesty 's government . I hope I 've made myself clear .
WATSON: Perfectly .
MYCROFT: Now if you 'll excuse me , gentlemen
WATSON: Goodbye , sir .
HOLMES: A pleasure , as always .
MYCROFT: Just a minute . You forgot your tool-kit . He tosses the cane to Holmes , who catches it .
WATSON: You will be gentle , wo n't you , when you tell her you 're dropping the case ?
HOLMES: Watson , what does the word Glennahurich suggest to you ?
WATSON: Absolutely nothing .
HOLMES: It 's Scottish .
WATSON: Is it ?
HOLMES: And like all Scottish names , it 's really a word picture . Glen means valley , na means of the , and Hurich , if memory serves me , means yew tree .
WATSON: You 're just trying to impress me .
HOLMES: So the three boxes go to the Valley of the Yew Tree .
WATSON: And I 'll be in Scotland before ye You are dropping the case , are n't you , Holmes ?
HOLMES: Open the door .
MRS. HUDSON: Oh , at last . It 's been a ghastly experience .
WATSON: Why ? What happened ?
MRS. HUDSON: Did you ever try doing embroidery with a gun in your hand ?
HOLMES: You 'll be relieved to know it was not loaded . He starts up the stairs , followed by Watson .
WATSON: Holmes , you did n't answer my question . Are you planning to disobey Mycroft 's orders ? He 's not just your brother , you know . You 'd be defying Her Majesty 's government
GABRIELLE: Any news ? Did you find out anything ?
HOLMES: Let 's just say I know what the next step will be .
GABRIELLE: Yes ?
HOLMES: I want you to pack your things .
GABRIELLE: Where are we going ?
WATSON: Holmes , let me caution you -
HOLMES: At 7 30 this evening , Dr. Watson and I are going to take you to Victoria Station , and put you on the boat-train .
GABRIELLE: The boat-train ?
WATSON: Well , that 's better .
GABRIELLE: You 're sending me back to Brussels ? Is that it ?
WATSON: Madame Valladon , you must understand
GABRIELLE: I came here to find my husband you were going to help me
WATSON: Yes , my dear . But circumstances have changed
GABRIELLE: The great detective ! Well , maybe this case is too small for you
WATSON: On the contrary . It 's being handled at a much higher level
GABRIELLE: Well , I wo n't go back to Brussels . Maybe you 're giving up , but I 'm not . I 'm going to go on looking for him . And nobody 's going to stop me even if they try to kill me .
HOLMES: Are you quite finished ? If you recall , what I said was that we 're going to put you on the boat-train I did n't say you were going to stay on it .
WATSON: She 's not ?
HOLMES: At 7 30 , Mr. Holmes and Dr. Watson will e seen waving goodbye to Madame Valladon at Victoria Station . At eight-twelve , Mr. and Mrs. Ashdown accompanied by thei valet John will appear at Euston Station , and oard the Highland Express to Inverness .
WATSON: Mr. and Mrs. ?
GABRIELLE: Thank you . I 'm sorry for what I said .
HOLMES: That 's not necessary .
GABRIELLE: I 'll go and pack . She hurries off toward Watson 's room .
WATSON: Maybe I should do it , since I 'm the valet .
HOLMES: As you like to put it in your chronicles , the game is afoot .
WATSON: But what game ? Are you really that interested in the Belgian engineer ?
GABRIELLE: You do n't like me very much , do you ? She moves toward the couch .
WATSON: Nothing of the sort . Quite the opposite But there 's more to this case than meets the eye
GABRIELLE: My other glove .
WATSON: Let me help you .
GABRIELLE: Thank you . She slowly starts to shut the parasol .
HOLMES: All right . You can look now .
GABRIELLE: Am I embarrassing you , Mr. Holmes ?
HOLMES: Not at all . Would it surprise you if I told you I once spent the night with 121 women ?
GABRIELLE: Oh ?
HOLMES: On a very interesting case in a harem in Constantinople .
WATSON: Sorry , father I mean , friar or is it abbot ?
GABRIELLE: Women are never to be trusted entirely not the best of them .
HOLMES: What did you say ?
GABRIELLE: I did n't say it you did . According to Dr. Watson .
HOLMES: Oh .
GABRIELLE: He gave me some back issues of Strand Magazine .
HOLMES: The good doctor is constantly putting words into my mouth .
GABRIELLE: Then you deny it ?
HOLMES: Not at all . I am not a whole-hearted admirer of womankind .
GABRIELLE: I 'm not very fond of them myself .
HOLMES: The most affectionate woman I ever knew was a murderess .
GABRIELLE: Oh ?
HOLMES: It was one of those passionate affairs at odd hours right in my laboratory . And all the time , behind my back , she was stealing cyanide to sprinkle on he husband 's steak and kidney pie .
GABRIELLE: You must n't judge all women by
HOLMES: Of course not . Only the ones I was involved with . And I do n't just mean professionally kleptomaniacs , nymphomaniacs , pyromaniacs . Take my fiancee , for instance
GABRIELLE: Your fiancee ?
HOLMES: She was the daughter of my violin teache we were engaged to be married the invitations were out , I was being fitted for a tail-coat and twenty-four hours efore the wedding , she died of influenza .
GABRIELLE: I 'm sorry .
HOLMES: It just proves my contention that women are unreliable and not to be trusted . Good night , Mrs. Ashdown . He pulls the curtain across his berth .
GABRIELLE: Good night , Mr. Ashdown .
MONK: Die Spur fuehrt nach Inverness . Die steigen dort aus . Dort muessen wir ihn finded den Valladon !
WATSON: Let 's see two , three , four
GABRIELLE: I 'll take that .
HOLMES: How do you get to Glennahurich ? How fa is it ?
BAGGAGEMAN: Glennahurich ?
WATSON: You know a valley with a yew tree ? Gabrielle casually opens her parasol .
BAGGAGEMAN: It 's about a mile out of town . Why would you be wanting to go there ?
WATSON: Well , if it 's got a view , it might be a nice place for a picnic .
BAGGAGEMAN: It 's got a view , right enough but it 's no place for a picnic .
HOLMES: Why not ?
BAGGAGEMAN: Because it 's a cemetary .
WATSON: The three boxes . Is that it , Holmes ?
HOLMES: I would think so .
GABRIELLE: The two small ones they must be children 's coffins .
MINISTER: earth to earth , ashes to ashes , dust to dust .
GABRIELLE: It 's so sad .
HOLMES: Sad and rather odd . There are no flowers and no mourners .
WATSON: Are you trying to tell us it was the monster ?
HOLMES: Here you are , Dad .
WATSON: To think that people still believe in that nonsense . Here we are , living in the Nineteenth Century
GABRIELLE: I 'm ashamed to admit it but I was elieved when he mentioned a father and two boys . It could possibly have anything to do with Emile .
HOLMES: It would appear not .
WATSON: However , there still remains the clue of the castle and the red runner whereve it may be .
HOLMES: Because it 's their brothers who have just een buried .
WATSON: Their brothers ?
HOLMES: And they 're not boys . They 're as tall as they 'll ever grow . Hand me some pebbles , will you ?
WATSON: Pebbles .
GABRIELLE: They are how do you say it in English ? nains .
WATSON: Midgets .
HOLMES: Boys with the faces of old men
WATSON: I still do n't see
HOLMES: Would it help if I told you they were acrobats ?
WATSON: Not at all .
HOLMES: Do you remember a tumbling act six others missing from the circus ?
WATSON: Oh , yes that case you turned down I completely forgot .
HOLMES: Some of us are cursed with memories like flypaper . And stuck there is a staggering of miscellaneous date , mostly useless .
GABRIELLE: Mr. Holmes , is those are not children , then ?
HOLMES: Quite . The question now is who 's in the third grave ?
WATSON: Holmes ! She 's fainted .
HOLMES: Hand me that lantern .
WATSON: It is Valladon , is n't it ?
HOLMES: Obviously . What is not so obvious is why his wedding ring has turned green
MANAGER: You have a lovely view of the loch from here as soon as the morning mist rolls away . If you 've a mind to do any sight-seeing , here 's a guide to the local points of interest .
HOLMES: Thank you .
MANAGER: This way , please . I will show you to you oom . Watson picks up his suitcase , follows him .
WATSON: I suppose you 're putting me in the asement .
MANAGER: No , your room is in the attic .
WATSON: Good .
MANAGER: It 's the privy that 's in the basement .
HOLMES: May I have your wedding ring , please ?
GABRIELLE: I 'm sorry .
HOLMES: I know it 's not easy . But you must emember that we 're that nice couple from London , on Holiday in the Highlands .
GABRIELLE: I 'll try .
HOLMES: That 's much better .
GABRIELLE: Thank you .
HOLMES: Now , if I may proceed without furthe interruptions
WATSON'S VOICE: Mr. Ashdown !
WATSON: Mr. Ashdown ! He flings the door open .
HOLMES: You saw what ?
WATSON: The telescope . Where 's the telescope ?
HOLMES: What did you see ?
WATSON: The monster !
HOLMES: The monster ?
WATSON: There it is ! There it is ! Holmes joins him on the balcony .
HOLMES: I see nothing .
WATSON: Nothing ?
HOLMES: Gone ? Maybe it was never there .
WATSON: I swear to you I saw it clear as anything
HOLMES: Watson , as you so succinctly put it , we are living in the Nineteenth Century He steps back into the room .
WATSON: Maybe that grave-digger was right the swell , and the boat overturning
HOLMES: Monsieur Valladon may have been found in the lake but he did not drown . He died of asphyxiation .
GABRIELLE: Asphyxiation .
HOLMES: There is only one substance that can turn a copper ring green and bleach the colo out of canaries chlorine gas .
WATSON: That may be . But the fact remains that I saw something out there .
HOLMES: A figment of your imagination . Now let us be logical . The only concrete lead we have is the reference to the castle The question is , which castle ?
WATSON: You call yourself logical ? You 're the least logical man I know .
HOLMES: Am I ?
WATSON: How can you say it 's a figment of my imagination , when for years you 've been saying I have no imagination whatsoever ! He looks at Holmes almost triumphantly .
HOLMES: Would you like some cranberry sauce , dear ?
GABRIELLE: Yes , dear .
HOLMES: Would you pass the cranberry sauce , please , John ?
WATSON: Yes , dear .
HOLMES: Quite .
GABRIELLE: A bee .
WATSON: Well , I do n't think we have to bothe with this castle . It 's just a pile of ubble .
GABRIELLE: Then why are they taking precautions ?
HOLMES: Why , indeed ? Let 's go .
WATSON: Go where ?
HOLMES: When rebuffed at the front door , one 's only choice is to try the tradesmen 's entrance .
GUIDE: Sorry . No visitors allowed .
HOLMES: Are you the guide here ?
GUIDE: Yes . The castle is closed to the public while work is going on .
HOLMES: What are they doing ?
GUIDE: It 's being restored by the Society fo the Preservation of Scottish Monuments .
HOLMES: Too bad . I particularly wanted my wife to see Urquhart Castle . The tower is one of the most interesting examples of about 1400 , was n't it ?
GUIDE: That 's right .
HOLMES: Let me see was it built under James the Second or James the Third ?
GUIDE: The Thrid If you come back next year , we 'll be all done here , and I 'll be glad to show you around .
HOLMES: Thank you .
WATSON: Pleasant sort , is n't he ?
HOLMES: Pleasant , but ignorant . He was off one hundred years and one James . It 's actually 1500 and James the Fourth .
GABRIELLE: If he 's an official guide , should n't he know ?
HOLMES: If he 's an official guide .
WATSON: No . Those birds are making too much of a acket .
HOLMES: They 're not just birds they 're our old friends . Watson and Gabrielle follow his gaze .
WATSON: Sulphuric acid ?
GABRIELLE: The more we find out the less sense it makes .
HOLMES: To a graduate chemist it makes a great deal of sense . Sulphuric acid , when exposed to salt-water , produces chlorine gas . Would you mind clasping your hands , Watson ?
WATSON: Like this ?
HOLMES: A little lower Thank you .
WATSON: Holmes , I have a feeling we 're redundant here .
HOLMES: If necessary .
WATSON: You 're going to catch your death of cold . Would n't it be ironic if Holmes ' last case were a case of pneumonia ? Sorry .
GABRIELLE: What 's that ? Holmes and Watson turn their heads .
WATSON: Holmes !
HOLMES: Quick , Watson . After it !
WATSON: Holmes , what are we doing ? We should be going away from it .
HOLMES: Keep rowing , dammit !
WATSON: At least you admit there 's an it , not just a figment of my imagination .
HOLMES: Quiet .
WATSON: Never without it .
HOLMES: I can hear something
GABRIELLE: I lost my parasol .
HOLMES: Where 's Watson ?
WATSON: I have come face to face with man-eating tigers I was once caught in a stampede of wild elephants India , you know ut I was n't half as frightened . This east seems to have a personal grudge against us .
GABRIELLE: I just hope it does n't come back .
HOLMES: I do n't think it will . Look ! They glance in the indicated direction .
WATSON: What strange goings-on .
HOLMES: Not really . My guess is that the monster , after a hard day 's work , has eturned home for his supper .
WATSON: Yes , I know . But would you believe that you ca n't borrow a decent pair of trousers in this place ?
HOLMES: It 's nothing new , actually . We 've come across this situation before .
WATSON: We have ? Where ?
HOLMES: At the ballet .
WATSON: Ballet ?
HOLMES: There 's a lake and there 's a castle and there 's a swan that is n't really a swan or , in this case , a monster that is n't really a monster
WATSON: Then what is it ?
HOLMES: What is it indeed that feeds on canary irds and sulphuric acid , and has an engine for a heart ?
GABRIELLE: An engine ?
HOLMES: The stethoscope is a very sensitive instrument , and water is an excellent conductor of sound . There is no doubt that what we are dealing with is a mechanical monster .
WATSON: Oh ?
HOLMES: Not only is it equipped with an artificial heart , it also has artificial lungs . Judging from the bubbles on the surface of the lake , it uses some form of air pump .
GABRIELLE: You think my husband was involved in all this ?
HOLMES: Yes , Madame Valladon . I 'm sure of it .
WATSON: But why would anybody build a mechanical monster ? Just to scare people ?
HOLMES: Not very likely .
GABRIELLE: Why did they try to keep me from finding my husband ? And why was he buried anonymously ?
HOLMES: I think I have a pretty good notion of what they 're up to the Society for the Preservation of Scottish Monuments etter known as the Diogenes Club .
WATSON: The Diogenes Club ? There is a knock on the door .
HOLMES: Come in .
MANAGER: Mr. Ashdown , I have a bottle of champagne for you .
HOLMES: A bottle of champagne ? I did n't orde it .
MANAGER: No , indeed . You are to deliver it . These are my instructions . He hands the magnum to Holmes .
HOLMES: Instructions from whom ? Deliver it where ?
MANAGER: I would n't know , sir . But there 's a carriage waiting for you downstairs .
HOLMES: Are you sure you have the right Mr. Ashdown ?
MANAGER: Quite sure , Mr. Holmes .
HOLMES: Well , Watson , I would say the curtain is going up on the last act .
WATSON: I do n't like the sound of it .
GABRIELLE: Please be careful .
WATSON: You 'd better take this with you .
HOLMES: Who 's minding the castle ?
GUIDE: You 'd better get on . It 's late .
HOLMES: Where are we going ? Some sort of party ?
GUIDE: You wo n't be disappointed in the guest list .
HOLMES: Who 's the host ?
GUIDE: Jonah .
MYCROFT: Mr. Ashdown , I presume .
HOLMES: The red runner , I presume .
MYCROFT: It 's not for you . McKeller . May I have the champagne , please ?
HOLMES: 1886 not a very good vintage , is it ?
MYCROFT: Mediocre . But then again , it 's not fo drinking .
HOLMES: Interesting and educational .
MYCROFT: Despite my most emphatic warning , you persisted in meddling . It would have served you right if you 'd all drowned .
HOLMES: Sorry to be so unobliging . E. Valladon H'mm .
MYCROFT: I imagine this belongs to the pretty lady , and this belongs to your valet We found them floating in the lake .
HOLMES: Speaking about things floating in the lake
MYCROFT: How much do you know or think you know ?
HOLMES: I think you 're testing some sort of underwater craft camouflauged to mislead the gullible . I think it 's an experimental model , operated by a crew of midgets . I think it is powered by sulphuric acid batteries , and uses canaries to detect escaping gas Altogether a strange contraption .
MYCROFT: Not quite that unique . Right now , fou countries are trying to develop what we call a submersible . But none of them could solve the critical problem how to stay submerged long enough to make it effective .
HOLMES: What does the Good Book say ? `` And Jonah lived in the belly of that fish for three days and three nights . ''
MYCROFT: That was our goal . And thanks to Valladon 's air-pump , we got a jump on the est of them . It 's a highly complex system of filtration so we had a series of trials
HOLMES: And at least one error .
MYCROFT: During a test run in Moray Firth , pressure caused a leak in the hull . Sea water mixed with the acid in the atteries to produce chlorine gas . Before they could reach the surface , Valladon and the crew were dead .
HOLMES: So you had them buried in unmarked graves , to preserve your secret .
MYCROFT: It was essential to keep the information from your client .
HOLMES: You went to all those lengths to prevent Madame Valladon from fiding her husband ?
MYCROFT: Your client is n't Madame Valladon it 's the Imperial German Government . They were after the Belgian engineer o ather , his invention . They knew he was employed by us , but they could n't find out where so they enlisted the best ain in England to help them . You , my dear brother , have been working for the Wilhelmstrasse .
HOLMES: And Madame Valladon what part did she play in all this ?
MYCROFT: Madame Valladon is dead .
HOLMES: Dead ?
MYCROFT: The Germans disposed of her three weeks ago , in Brussels . This is Gabrielle Valladon .
HOLMES: Go on .
MYCROFT: They planted her on you quite neatly , I must admit , so that you could lead them to their objective , the air pump . Very much like using a hog to find truffles . And now perhaps you 'd care to join me . I am expecting a certain royal personage from Balmoral .
QUEEN VICTORIA: It was long and it was tedious . And it had better be worth our while , Mr. Holmes .
MYCROFT: I can assure you , Ma'am , it will be .
QUEEN VICTORIA: Now what is this curious ship we are supposed to christen ?
MYCROFT: We call it a submersible , Ma'am . It travels under water .
QUEEN VICTORIA: Under water ? What a fantastic idea . They have now reached the top of the steps .
MYCROFT: Ma'am , may present some of the scientists who were responsible for this achievement . J.W . Ferguson , naval architect
FIRST SCIENTIST: Your Majesty .
MYCROFT: Professor Simpson , our leading expert on hydraulics
SECOND SCIENTIST: Your Majesty .
MYCROFT: W.W. Prescott , co-inventor of the evolving periscope
THIRD SCIENTIST: Your Majesty .
MYCROFT: And this is Sir Arthur Grisby , ou authority on maritime ballistics
QUEEN VICTORIA: We do n't claim to understand any of this . But England is proud of you , gentlemen . To think that man can now observe fish in their native habitat
MYCROFT: Well , not exactly , Ma'am
QUEEN VICTORIA: and underwater plants and coral eefs Young man what was your contribution to this project ?
HOLMES: I 'm afraid it was rather negligible , You Majesty .
MYCROFT: This is my brother , Sherlock , Ma'am .
QUEEN VICTORIA: Ah , yes . Sherlock Holmes . We have been following your exploits with great interest .
HOLMES: Thank you , Ma'am .
QUEEN VICTORIA: Are you engaged in one of you fascinating cases at the moment ?
HOLMES: In a manner of speaking , Ma'am .
QUEEN VICTORIA: When can we expect to read Dr. Watson 's account of the case ?
HOLMES: I hope never , Ma'am . It has not been one of my more successful endeavors .
QUEEN VICTORIA: Ah , the ceremonies are about to begin . Now where is this underwater ship of yours ?
MYCROFT: In the dungeon , Ma'am .
QUEEN VICTORIA: The dungeon ? What a peculiar place to keep it . Well , let us get on with it , gentlemen .
MYCROFT: There she , Ma'am . Her Majesty 's Ship Jonah .
QUEEN VICTORIA: And what , may we ask , is the purpose of that hideous gargoyle ?
MYCROFT: It 's merely a decoy , Ma'am .
QUEEN VICTORIA: Oh . To frighten away the sharks , we imagine .
MYCROFT: Something of the sort The crew will now demonstrate the workings of the submersible .
SAILOR: Stand to . The midgets scramble down the hatch .
QUEEN VICTORIA: Are n't they rather small for sailors ?
MYCROFT: They are . But because of the size of the craft , the Navy made an exception .
QUEEN VICTORIA: They should make it a rule . It 's quite fatiguing to pin on all those medals while standing on our toes .
MYCROFT: This is the main engine , which propels it under water at the rate of two knots the stabilizing mechanism the multi- stage compressor the ballast tank trimmer the air-pump which filters and ecirculates the air
QUEEN VICTORIA: How charming .
MYCROFT: The air pump , Ma'am ?
QUEEN VICTORIA: The canaries . Must make the crew feel at home .
MYCROFT: Yes , Ma'am . These are the levers fo firing the torpedoes , which are accurate up to as much as 120 feet the periscope for scanning the surface of the water
QUEEN VICTORIA: But where is the glass bottom ?
MYCROFT: The what , Ma'am ?
QUEEN VICTORIA: The glass bottom .
HOLMES: You know to see the fist
QUEEN VICTORIA: and the plants and the corals
MYCROFT: That 's not quite the idea , Ma'am . H.M.S . Jonah is being commissioned as a warship .
QUEEN VICTORIA: A warship ? Stop that noise . Stop it !
MYCROFT: Ma'am , if I may explain
QUEEN VICTORIA: You had better .
MYCROFT: The Admiralty regards this craft as the ultimate weapon in naval warfare . It can seek out enemy ships and destroy them with these torpedoes while remaining completely invisible .
QUEEN VICTORIA: You mean in can fire at other vessels while under water ?
MYCROFT: Yes , Ma'am .
QUEEN VICTORIA: Without any warning ?
MYCROFT: That is correct , Ma'am .
QUEEN VICTORIA: And without showing her colors ?
MYCROFT: Indeed , Ma'am .
QUEEN VICTORIA: Mr. Holmes , we are not amused . It is unsportsmanlike , it is un-English , and it is in very poor taste . We will have none of it !
MYCROFT: I beg your pardon , Ma'am ? He exchanges a look with Holmes .
QUEEN VICTORIA: Sometimes we despair of the state of the world . What will scientists think of next ?
MYCROFT: That 's precisely it , Ma'am . At this very moment the Germans under Count von Zeppelin , are experimenting with a dirigible
QUEEN VICTORIA: A dirigible ? And what , pray , is that ?
MYCROFT: A rigid balloon , which could fly ove London and drop a bomb on Buckingham Palace . It is being developed at the express orders of Kaiser Wilhelm the Second .
QUEEN VICTORIA: Nonsense . We refuse to believe that ou grandson Willie would do a thing like that .
MYCROFT: We have conclusive proof , Ma'am . Ou agent in Friedrichshafen , a man named Ibbetson , actually saw the dirigible , and made a drawing of it . Unfortunately , he was apprehended before he could cross the order .
QUEEN VICTORIA: Nevertheless , we do n't want any part of this beastly invention . Get rid of it ! Scuttle it ! The sooner the better .
MYCROFT: May I point out , Ma'am
QUEEN VICTORIA: And do n't concern yourself about that dirigible dropping bombs on us . We shall write a very sharp note to the Kaiser . Now we wish to return to Balmoral .
HOLMES: Well , Mycroft , it seems we have both been undone by a woman . What a shame .
MYCROFT: Not necessarily . If the Germans want that submersible so badly , why do n't we give it to them ?
HOLMES: Give it to them ?
MYCROFT: Invite them aboard for the final journey seven hundred feet straight down .
HOLMES: And how are you going to arrange that ?
MYCROFT: I 'm rather counting on you to do it . Since you are on such intimate terms with Fraulein von Hoffmanstal . O.s. , the bagpiper resumes playing .
HOLMES: Sorry about that . But as long as you 're up what is the German word for castle ? Schloss , is n't it ?
GABRIELLE: I think so .
HOLMES: And how would you say under the castle ? Unter das Schlss ? Or die Schloss ?
GABRIELLE: I do n't know . My German is n't that good .
HOLMES: Your Trappist friends are out there waiting to hear from you it 's a chilly morning we do n't want to keep them standing around too long , do we , Fraulein Hoffmanstal ? Come now . It 's too late to play cat and mouse .
GABRIELLE: Unter dem Schloss .
HOLMES: Thank you . Here 's your signalling device it 's a it damp , I 'm afraid would you care to let them know where they can find the submersible ? No ? Then I 'll just have to do it myself . I only hope my Morse code is adequate to the occasion .
GABRIELLE: You 're all wrong about me . My name is n't Hoffmanstal .
HOLMES: It is n't ?
GABRIELLE: It 's von Hoffmanstal .
HOLMES: I stand corrected .
GABRIELLE: I suppose once they 're in the castle It must amuse you , Mr. Holmes , Trappists walking into a trap .
HOLMES: It 's more amusing than that . Once in the castle , they will encounter surprisingly little resistance it will take but a small bottle of chloroform to overcome the guards .
GABRIELLE: You mean you 're going to let them have the air-pump ?
HOLMES: Better than that . We 're going to let them have the submersible . They will find it with its engines running , all set to go . I assume they 're all expert sailors ? And since there is a German attleship cruising off the coast of Scotland , I expect they 'll try to sail it out of the lock and rendezvous at sea .
GABRIELLE: Did you say try to ?
HOLMES: I would suggest you get your things together . Mycroft will be here to take you into custody .
GABRIELLE: I never had you fooled for a moment , did I ? You knew right from the beginning when the cabbie brought me to Bake Street .
HOLMES: Let me see not quite that soon . He stretches out on the bed .
GABRIELLE: It 's so funny . I asked for this assignment , you know . I was scheduled to go to Japan , but I could n't resist the challenge of coming up against the best . I 'm sorry I did n't give you a close game .
HOLMES: Close enough .
GABRIELLE: You 're just being kind . I failed miserably .
HOLMES: We all have occasional failures . Fortunately , Dr. Watson never writes about mine .
WATSON: Holmes ! Holmes !
HOLMES: It was out there . Now it 's gone .
WATSON: Gone ?
HOLMES: Forever . Look for yourself .
WATSON: A bottle of champagne ? and a Bible ?
HOLMES: That 's all that 's left of H.M.S . Jonah .
WATSON: Do you know what he 's talking about ?
MYCROFT: Fraulein von Hoffmanstal ?
GABRIELLE: Yes , Mr. Holmes . I 'm all ready .
MYCROFT: If there 's one thing I like about the Prussians , it 's their punctuality .
GABRIELLE: If there 's one thing I dislike about the British , it 's their climate . I understand your jails are quite damp and your heating facilities totally inadequate .
MYCROFT: They are . But you 're not going to jail . You 're going back to Germany .
GABRIELLE: Germany ?
MYCROFT: You will be conducted to the Swiss-German order , and be exchanged for one of ou agents a man named Ibbetson .
GABRIELLE: Thank you .
MYCROFT: Do n't thank me . Thank my brother . It was his idea .
HOLMES: And better than some consulting detectives .
MYCROFT: Shall we ?
GABRIELLE: I 'll take that . Gentlemen .
WATSON: All right , Holmes you do n't have to explain anything to me , if you do n't want to .
HOLMES: I appreciate that , Watson .
WATSON: After all , I 'm only your official iographer
HOLMES: Anyway , I do n't think she 'd care to have this story spread all over Strand Magazine .
WATSON: The public has a right to know these things . If she 's a German spy , why should we concern ourselves about he feelings ?
HOLMES: Quiet . I 'm trying to read a personal message .
WATSON: A message ?
HOLMES: Auf Wiedersehn .
WATSON: Auf Weider- ? The nerve !
HOLMES: H'mmm . A letter from the Diogenes Club .
WATSON: Maybe Mycroft is putting you up fo membership .
HOLMES: If only to have the distinct pleasure of lackballing his brother .
WATSON: Are n't you going to finish you eakfast ?
HOLMES: Where is it , Watson ?
WATSON: In the files . May to July , 1885 .
HOLMES: You 're getting better .
LESTRADE: Good morning , Watson . Just happened to be in the neighborhood , and I thought
WATSON: What is it this time , Inspector Lestrade ?
LESTRADE: We 've had three rather nasty murders in Whitechapel . All ladies of easy virtue . You may read something about it the newspapers are referring to the killer as Jack the Ripper .
WATSON: Yes , I think I have .
LESTRADE: Some of us at Scotland Yard were wondering if perhaps Mr. Holmes would be willing to
WATSON: I 'm sorry , Lestrade . But at the moment , Holmes is working on another problem .
LESTRADE: Oh Well , I just thought it was the kind of case that might interest him . I dare say we can solve it without his help .
WATSON: Oh , I 'm sure you will .
THE PRODUCERS: _____________
BIALYSTOCK: Do n't forget the checkee . Ca n't produce playees without checkees .
BLOOM: How do you do . I mean Excuse me I mean
BIALYSTOCK: You mean ooops , do n't you ? Say ooops and get out .
BLOOM: I 'll wait in the hall
BIALYSTOCK: Oooooooops !
BLOOM: Ooooooops .
BIALYSTOCK: Wait . Wait . We ca n't play today . I have too many appointments .
LANDLORD: That 's the law .
BIALYSTOCK: Murderer ! Thief ! How can you take the last penny out of a man 's pocket ?
LANDLORD: I have to I 'm a landlord !
BIALYSTOCK: Oh Lord , hear my plea . Destroy him . He maketh a blight on the land .
LANDLORD: Do n't pay attention . He 's crazy .
BIALYSTOCK: Nnnnn . That hurt . I 'll have to make another call .
BLOOM: Uh uh ooooooops ?
BIALYSTOCK: Who are you ? What do you want ? Why are you loitering in my hallway ? Speak , dummy , speak ! Why do n't you speak ?
BLOOM: Scared . Ca n't talk .
BIALYSTOCK: All right . Get a hold of yourself . Take a deep breath , let it out slowly and tell me who you are .
BLOOM: I 'm Leo Bloom , I 'm an accountant , I 'm from Whitehall and Marks , I was sent here to do your books and I 'm terribly sorry I caught you with the old lady .
BIALYSTOCK: `` Caught you with the old lady . '' Come in , Mr . Tact .
BLOOM: Yes sir .
BIALYSTOCK: Then account for yourself ! Do you elieve in God ? Do you believe in gold ? Why are you looking up old lady 's dresses ? Bit of a pervert , eh ?
BLOOM: Sir , I
BIALYSTOCK: Never mind . Never mind . Do the ooks . They 're in that desk ove there . Top drawer .
BLOOM: But sir , I 'm not condem
BIALYSTOCK: Shut up . I 'm having a rhetorical conversation . How humiliating . Max Bialystock . Max Bialystock .
BLOOM: Yes , sir . Thank you .
BIALYSTOCK: Window 's so filthy , ca n't tell if it 's day or night out there .
BLOOM: Koff , koff ahem , ahem harrumph
BIALYSTOCK: I assume you are making those cartoon noises to attract my attention . Am I correct in my assumption , you fish-faced enemy of the people ?
BLOOM: Sir , may I speak to you for a minute ?
BIALYSTOCK: Go ! You have fifty-eight seconds .
BLOOM: Well , sir , it seems
BIALYSTOCK: You have forty-eight seconds left . Hurry . Hurry .
BLOOM: In looking at your books , I 've discovered that
BIALYSTOCK: Twenty-eight seconds , hurry , hurry , you 're using up your time .
BLOOM: Mr. Bialystock , I can not function under these conditions .
BIALYSTOCK: What is that ? A handkerchief ?
BLOOM: It 's nothing nothing .
BIALYSTOCK: If it 's nothing , why ca n't I see it ?
BLOOM: My blanket . Give me my blue blanket .
BIALYSTOCK: Here , do n't panic .
BLOOM: I 'm sorry I do n't like people touching my blue blanket . It 's not important . It 's a minor compulsion . I can deal with it if I want to . It 's just that I 've had it eve since I was a baby and and I find it very comforting .
BIALYSTOCK: They come here . They all come here . How do they find me ?
BLOOM: Mr. Bialystock
BIALYSTOCK: Yes , Prince Mishkin , what can we do for you ?
BLOOM: This is hardly a time for levity . I 've discovered a serious erro here in the accounts of your last play .
BIALYSTOCK: Where ? What ?
BLOOM: According to the backer 's list you aised $ 60,000 . But the show you produced only cost fifty-eight thousand . There 's two thousand dollars unaccounted for .
BIALYSTOCK: I went to a Turkish bath , who cares ? The show was a flop . What difference does it make ?
BLOOM: It makes a great deal of difference . That 's fraud . If they found out , you could go to prison .
BIALYSTOCK: Why should they find out ? It 's only two thousand dollars , Bloom , do me a favor , move a few decimal points around . You can do it . You 're an accountant . The word 'count ' is part of your title .
BLOOM: But that 's cheating !
BIALYSTOCK: It 's not cheating It 's charity . Bloom , look at me look at me ! I 'm drowning . Other men sail through life . Bialystock has struck a reef . Bloom , I 'm going under . I am being sunk by a society that demands success , when all I can offer is failure . Bloom , I 'm reaching out to you . Do n't send me to jail . Help ! Help !
BLOOM: Oh dear , oh dear , oh dear , oh dear .
BIALYSTOCK: Help !
BLOOM: All right . I 'll do it . I 'll do it .
BIALYSTOCK: Thank you , Bloom . I knew I could con you .
BLOOM: Oh , it 's all right wha ?
BIALYSTOCK: Nothing . Nothing . Do it . Do it .
BLOOM: Now let 's see , two thousand dollars . That is n't much . I 'm sure I can hide it somewhere . After all , the department of internal revenue is n't interested in a show that flopped .
BIALYSTOCK: Yes . Right . Good thinking . You figure it out . I 'm tired . I 'm gon na take a little nap . Wake me if there 's a fire .
BLOOM: Now let 's see , if we add these figures , we get
BIALYSTOCK: Yes ? ? ?
BLOOM: Yes , what ?
BIALYSTOCK: What you were saying . Keep talking .
BLOOM: What was I saying ?
BIALYSTOCK: You were saying that under the ight circumstances , a produce could make more money with a flop than he could with a hit .
BLOOM: Yes , it 's quite possible .
BIALYSTOCK: You keep saying that , but you do n't tell me how . How could a produce make more money with a flop than with a hit ?
BLOOM: It 's simply a matter of creative accounting . Let us assume , just for the moment , that you are a dishonest man .
BIALYSTOCK: Assume away !
BLOOM: Well , it 's very easy . You simply aise more money than you really need .
BIALYSTOCK: What do you mean ?
BLOOM: You 've done it yourself , only you did it on a very small scale .
BIALYSTOCK: What did I do ?
BLOOM: You raised two thousand more than you needed to produce your last play .
BIALYSTOCK: So what ? What did it get me ? I 'm wearing a cardboard belt .
BLOOM: Ahhhhhh ! But that 's where you made your error . You did n't go all the way . You see , if you were really a old criminal , you could have aised a million .
BIALYSTOCK: But the play only cost $ 60,000 to produce .
BLOOM: Exactly . And how long did it run ?
BIALYSTOCK: One night .
BLOOM: See ? You could have raised a million dollars , put on a sixty thousand dollar flop and kept the est .
BIALYSTOCK: But what if the play was a hit ?
BLOOM: Oh , you 'd go to jail . If the play were a hit , you 'd have to pay off the backers , and with so many ackers there could never be enough profits to go around , get it ?
BIALYSTOCK: Aha , aha , aha , aha , aha , aha ! ! So , in order for the scheme to work , we 'd have to find a sure fire flop .
BLOOM: What scheme ?
BIALYSTOCK: What scheme ? Your scheme , you loody little genius .
BLOOM: Oh , no . No . No . I meant no scheme . I merely posed a little , academic accounting theory . It 's just a thought .
BIALYSTOCK: Bloom , worlds are turned on such thoughts !
BIALYSTOCK: `` Ah , Rio , Rio by the seao , meo , myo , meo ``
BLOOM: Mr. Bialystock . No . Wait . Please . You 're holding me too tight . I 'm an honest man . You do n't understand .
BIALYSTOCK: No , Bloom , you do n't understand . This is fate , this is destiny . There 's no avoiding it .
BLOOM: Mr. Bialystock , not more than five minutes ago , against my bette judgment , I doctored your books . That , sir , is the ultimate extent of my criminal life .
BIALYSTOCK: OOOOOHH ! OOOOOHH ! OOOOOHH ! OOOOOHH ! I WANT THAT MONEY !
BLOOM: Oh , I fell on my keys . I 've got to get out of here .
BIALYSTOCK: You miserable , cowardly , wretched little caterpillar . Do n't you eve want to become a butterfly ? Do n't you want to spread your wings and flap your way to glory ?
BLOOM: You 're going to jump on me .
BIALYSTOCK: What ? ? ?
BLOOM: Poppea . She was his wife . And she was unfaithful to him . So he got mad and he jumped on her . Up and down , up and down , until he squashed her like a bug . Please do n't jump on me .
BIALYSTOCK: I 'm not going to jump on you !
BLOOM: Aaaaaaaaaa !
BIALYSTOCK: Will you get a hold on yourself .
BLOOM: Do n't touch me ! Do n't touch me !
BIALYSTOCK: What are you afraid of ? I 'm not going to hurt you ! What 's the matter with you ?
BLOOM: I 'm hysterical . I 'm having hysterics . I 'm hysterical . I ca n't stop . When I get like this , I ca n't stop . I 'm hysterical .
BIALYSTOCK: What can I do ? What can I do ? You 're getting me hysterical .
BLOOM: Go away from me . You frighten me . Sit over there .
BIALYSTOCK: Okay . I 'm way over here . Is that etter ?
BLOOM: It 's a little better , but you still look angry .
BIALYSTOCK: How 's this ?
BLOOM: Good . Good . That 's nice . That 's very nice . I think I 'm coming out of it now . Yes . Yes . I 'm definitely coming out of it . Thank you for smiling . It helped a great deal .
BIALYSTOCK: Well , you know what they say , `` Smile and the world smiles with you . '' Heh , heh . The man should be in a straight jacket . Feeling better ?
BLOOM: Much , thank you . But I am a little lightheaded . Maybe I should eat something . Hysterics have a way of severely depleting one 's blood sugar , you know .
BIALYSTOCK: They certainly do . They certainly do . Come , let me take you to lunch .
BLOOM: That 's very kind of you , Mr. Bialystock , but I
BIALYSTOCK: Nonsense , nonsense , my dear boy . I lowered your blood sugar , but least I could do is raise it a little .
BLOOM: Thank you .
BIALYSTOCK: Je vous empris .
BLOOM: I 'll get it .
BIALYSTOCK: Murray , I 'm going to lunch . I took two dollars .
BLOOM: I got it , Mr. Bialystock .
BIALYSTOCK: Thank you , Leo . And call me Max . You know , I do n't let everybody call me Max . It 's only people I eally like .
BLOOM: Okay Max ! And you can call me Leo .
BIALYSTOCK: I already have . Come on .
BLOOM: Oh .
BIALYSTOCK: Where would you like to eat ?
BLOOM: Well , Max , I do n't know , Max . What do you think , Max ?
BIALYSTOCK: Let me see it 's such a beautiful day . Why waste it indoors . I 've got it ! Let 's go to Coney Island ! We 'll lunch at the sea shore .
BLOOM: Coney Island ? ?
BIALYSTOCK: What 's the matter , Leo ? Do n't you like Coney Island ?
BLOOM: I I love it . I have n't been there since I was a kid . But it 's nearly two o'clock . I really should be getting back to Whitehall and Marks .
BIALYSTOCK: Nonsense ! As far as Whitehall and Marks are concerned , you 're working with Bialystock , right ?
BLOOM: Right .
BIALYSTOCK: Then stick with Bialystock !
CUSTARD MAN: What kind now , sports ?
BIALYSTOCK: What kind now , Leo ?
BLOOM: I do n't know . Let 's see . We 've had chocolate , vanilla , banana - let 's go green .
BIALYSTOCK: Two pistachios , my good man .
CUSTARD MAN: I 'm not your good man , I happen to own this establishment .
BIALYSTOCK: Everybody 's a big shot . Well , Leo , are you having a good time ?
BLOOM: I do n't know . I think so . I feel very strange .
BIALYSTOCK: Maybe you 're happy .
BLOOM: Yes . That 's it . Happy . Well , whatta ya think of that . Happy .
BIALYSTOCK: Bloom , it can always be like this . Life can be beautiful . Let me show you . Stick with
BLOOM: But if we 're caught , we 'll go to prison .
BIALYSTOCK: You think you 're not in prison now ? Living in a grey little room . Going to a grey little job . Leading a grey little life .
BLOOM: You 're right . You 're absolutely ight . I 'm a nothing . I spend my life counting other people 's money people I 'm smarter than , etter than . Where 's my share ? Where 's Leo Bloom 's share ? I want , I want , I want , I want everything I 've ever seen in the movies !
BIALYSTOCK: You bet your boots , Leo . It 's Bialystock and Bloom on the rise . Upward and onward . Say , you 'll join me . Nothing can stop us .
BLOOM: I 'll do it ! By God , I 'll do it !
BIALYSTOCK: This is where we belong , Leo . On top of the world . Top of the world !
BLOOM: Ohhhhhhhh ! ! !
BIALYSTOCK: Read , read . We 've got to find the worst play ever written .
BLOOM: Wait a minute , I 've read this part . I 'm reading plays I read this morning .
BIALYSTOCK: We 'll never find it , eh ? We 'll never find it , eh ? Ha , ha , ha , ha , ha .
BLOOM: Max , what is it ? What are you doing ? What 's happening ?
BIALYSTOCK: I 'll tell you what 's happening . We 've struck gold . Not fool 's gold , but real gold . The mothe lode . The mother lode . The mothe of them all .
BLOOM: You found a flop !
BIALYSTOCK: A flop , ha ! That 's putting it mildly . A disaster ! A catastrophe ! An outrage ! A guaranteed-to-close- in-one-night beauty !
BLOOM: `` SPRINGTIME FOR HITLER , A Gay Romp with Adolph and Eva in Berchtesgarten . '' Fantastic !
BIALYSTOCK: It 's practically a love letter to Hitler !
BLOOM: It wo n't run a week !
BIALYSTOCK: Run a week ? Are you kidding ? This play has got to close in the first act .
BLOOM: Who wrote it ?
SUPER: Who do you want ?
BLOOM: I beg your pardon ?
SUPER: Who do you want ? No one gets in the building unless I know who they want I 'm the concierge . My husband used to be the concierge . He 's dead . Now I 'm the concierge .
BIALYSTOCK: We are seeking Mr. Franz Liebkind .
SUPER: Oh , the kraut . He 's on the top floor . Apartment twenty-three .
BLOOM: Thank you .

BLOOM: We uh get your drift . Thank you , Madam .
SUPER: I 'm not a madam . I 'm a concierge .
LIEBKIND: Hilda , look look good Hilda , you 're not looking . Hilda , if he lives , I know you will find him .

LIEBKIND: Vit the Fuhrer , of course . He liked me . Out of all the household staff at Berchtesgarten , I vas his favorite . I vas the only one allowed into his chambers at bedtime .
BIALYSTOCK: No kidding ?
LIEBKIND: Oh , sure . I used to take him his hot milk and his opium . Achhh , those were the days . Vat good times ve had . Dinner parties vit lovely ladies and gentlemen , singing und dancing . You know , not many people knew about it , but the Fuhrer vas a terrific dancer .
BIALYSTOCK: Really , I never dreamed
LIEBKIND: That 's because you were taken in by that verdampter Allied propaganda . Such filthy lies . But nobody said a bad vord about Winston Churchill , did they ? Oh no , Vin Vit Vinnie ! Churchill , vit his cigars and his andy and his rotten paintings . Could n't even say Nazi . He would say Narzis , Narzis . Ve vere not Narzies , ve vere Nazis . But let me tell this , and you 're getting it straight from the horse , Hitler vas etter looking than Churchill , he vas a better dresser than Churchill , had more hair , told funnier jokes , and could dance the pants off Churchill !
BIALYSTOCK: That 's exactly why we want to do this play . To show the world the true Hitler , the Hitler you knew , the Hitler you loved , the Hitle with a song in his heart .

BLOOM: Mrs. Sarah Catheart . She owns 50 % of the profits .

BLOOM: Then the Department of Justice owns 100 % of Bialystock and Bloom .
BIALYSTOCK: OI . I 'm depressed . Leo , do me a favor . Open the safe . I want to see the money .
BLOOM: What are you doing ?

BLOOM: Max , as I was saying , maybe we should go easy on the spending . I mean these offices and everything .
BIALYSTOCK: Why ? Take it when you can get it ! Flaunt it , baby , flaunt it !
BLOOM: But if something should God forbid go wrong , at least we could give them some of their money ack . It would look better in court .
BIALYSTOCK: Stop talking like that , you white mouse ! Nothing 's going to go wrong . As a matter of fact , today I have taken steps to insure total disaster . At two o'clock we have an appointment with none other than Roger De Bris .
BLOOM: Roger De Bris . Roger De Bris . Oh yes , the director . Is he good I mean bad ?
BIALYSTOCK: Roger De Bris is the worst directo that ever lived .

CARMEN: Ah , yes , you 're expected . Please come in .
DE BRIS: I 'll never get into this damned thing .
CARMEN: We 're not alone .
DE BRIS: Ah , Messers Bialystock and Bloom , I presume . Ha , ha , ha , forgive the pun .
BLOOM: What pun ?
BIALYSTOCK: Shut up . He thinks he 's witty . It 's good to see you again , Roger . Did you get a chance to read `` Springtime For Hitler ? ''
DE BRIS: Remarkable . Remarkable . A stunning piece of work .
BLOOM: Max ! He 's wearing a dress .
BIALYSTOCK: Shhhhhh .
DE BRIS: I think it 's a very important play . I , for one , never realized that the Third Reich meant Germany . I mean it 's drenched with historical goodies like that .
CARMEN: We always win .
DE BRIS: I 'm not so sure about tonight . I 'm supposed to be the Grand Duchess I think I look more like Tugboat Annie . What do you think ?
BLOOM: Well , it 's uh it 's nice and long I mean , it 's uh uh where do you keep your wallet ?
BIALYSTOCK: It 's gorgeous . Absolutely gorgeous . You could n't have picked a bette color . It brings out your eyes . Let 's face it , Roger , that dress is you .
DE BRIS: Do you really think it brings out my eyes ?
CARMEN: We ca n't tell a thing without you wig . As far as I 'm concerned , you 're only half-dressed .
DE BRIS: Ummmm . Well , if you 're so worried about the wig , get it , o ' wicked witch of the west .
BIALYSTOCK: Quick , light his cigarette . He likes you .
DE BRIS: Did n't I meet you on a summer cruise ?
BLOOM: I 've I 've never been on a cruise .
DE BRIS: Oh , quel dommage .
CARMEN: Oh , I see we 're getting acquainted .
DE BRIS: How would you like to go back to teasing hair , big mouth ?
BIALYSTOCK: Roger , do you mind if we talk a little business ?
DE BRIS: Please , please , that 's what we 're here for . Be careful , that hurt .
BIALYSTOCK: I think this would be a marvelous opportunity for you , Roger . Up to now , you 've always been associated with musicals , and
DE BRIS: Yes . Dopey show-girls in gooey gowns . Two-three-kick-turn ! Turn- turn-kick-turn ! It 's enough to make you throw up ! At last a chance to do straight drama ! To deal with conflict , with inne truth . Roger De Bris presents history . Of course , I think we should add a little music . That whole third act has got to go . They 're losing the war . It 's too depressing . We 'll have to put something in there . Aaahghhh ! I see it ! A line of eautiful girls , dressed as Storm Troopers , black patent leathe oots , all marching together Two-three-kick-turn ! Turn-turn- kick-turn !
BIALYSTOCK: That 's genius . That 's genius . Roger , I think I speak for Mr. Bloom and myself when I say that you 're the only man in the world who can do justice to SPRINGTIME
DE BRIS: Wait a minute . This is a very big decision . It might effect the course of my entire life . I 'll have to think about it . I 'll do it .
BIALYSTOCK: Congratulations .
DE BRIS: Get on the phone . Send out a casting call . Call every agent in town . I want to see everybody . Everybody .
BIALYSTOCK: Roger , what about that one ? The fat Hitler on the right ?
DE BRIS: I do n't know . I rather fancy that one .
BIALYSTOCK: Not bad . Not bad . What do you think , Franz ?
LIEBKIND: I do n't know . I do n't know . Fo some strange reason , I 'm deeply moved .
DE BRIS: Oh , this is bedlam , bedlam . We must have some order .

CARMEN: Well , that 's it .
BLOOM: I think that 's enough Hitlers fo one day . Maybe we 'll get lucky tomorrow .
BIALYSTOCK: You think out of all those Hitlers you could find just one
LIEBKIND: It was the same thing in Germany . We looked for years before we found the right Hitler .
LSD: Hey , man .
CARMEN: I beg your pardon .
LSD: Is this where they 're auditioning Boomerang ?
CARMEN: No , I 'm afraid you 've wandered into the wrong theatre .
LSD: Man , freaked out again .
BIALYSTOCK: Wait ! This is Boomerang . This is Boomerang .
DE BRIS: What are you saying ?
BIALYSTOCK: Let 's hear him . What have we got to lose ? What 's your name ?
LSD: Lorenzo Saint DuBois . But everybody calls me LSD .
DE BRIS: What have you done , LSD ?
LSD: Six months , I 'm out on probation , ut it 's cool now , baby .
DE BRIS: I mean in show business .
LSD: Oh , in show business . Well , let 's put it this way , my next job will e my debut .
DE BRIS: What do you do best ?
LSD: Hey , man , I ca n't do that here , that 's what they put me away for .

LIEBKIND: Vaaaat ? ? ?
BIALYSTOCK: Franz , do n't you see , Hitler was a man of his time . This is a man of his time .
LIEBKIND: But he has long hair !
BIALYSTOCK: Do n't look at the outside , look at the inside . It 's the inner Hitle we 're after . The young beautiful Hitler , who danced his way to glory .
LIEBKIND: I do n't know . I do n't know .
DE BRIS: Could be an exciting piece of off- eat casting . Of course , we 'd have to do something about that coiffure .
LIEBKIND: But he 's so crazy , he 's so sloppy , he 's so so American !
BIALYSTOCK: Franz , trust me . I promise I wo n't let you down .
LIEBKIND: All right , but remember , if you damage the Fuhrer 's reputation , I kill you .
BIALYSTOCK: Bite your tongue .
LIEBKIND: Gentlemen , this is a very momentous moment .
BIALYSTOCK: So much for Nutsy Fagin .

DRAMA CRITIC: Thank you . Here , wait a minute . There seems to be some mistake . There 's a hundred dollar bill wrapped around these tickets .
BIALYSTOCK: It 's no mistake . Enjoy the show .
DRAMA CRITIC: Mr. Bialystock , just what do you think you 're doing ?
BIALYSTOCK: I 'm bribing you . And if you play all , there 's a lot more where that came from .
DRAMA CRITIC: I I I How dare he ! I 've never been so insulted in my life ! The gall of the man ! The incredible gall of the man ! I 'll fix his wagon .

MAN: That 's Hitler ? I get it ! It 's a put-on .
WOMAN: Hey , Harry , he 's funny .
BIALYSTOCK: Here 's to the one and only performance of `` Springtime fo Hitler . ''
BLOOM: Just think , yesterday I was a meaningless little accountant and today , I am the producer of a Broadway flop !
BIALYSTOCK: To failure !
BLOOM: To failure !
DRUNK: Oh , thank you ! It 's very kind of you .
EVA: If the Duke of Windsor could give up the Throne of England for the woman he loved , why ca n't you ?
LSD: It 's different . I 'm a tyrant , baby .
LIEBKIND: Baby , why does he keep saying baby ? I did n't write baby . The Fuhre never said baby . Vat is it vit this baby ?
BIALYSTOCK: Bartender , bartender , another drink for myself and my associate , Mr. Bloom . And do n't forget our good- natured inebriate over there .

BLOOM: No way out . No way out . What ? Who ?
BIALYSTOCK: Why do n't we go over to the theatre and see what 's really happening ? After all , we 've only heard from a small portion of the audience . Let 's hear what the majority thinks .
BLOOM: The majority . The majority . Yes . Let 's hear from the majority .
BIALYSTOCK: Come , we have to .
GENERAL: We are falling back on all fronts . Our soldiers are retreating .

STAGE MANAGER: Get that curtain up .
LIEBKIND: NO ! No ! The curtain must not go up !
ULLA: We make love ?
BIALYSTOCK: No ! No ! We do n't make love . Go to work .
DE BRIS: Congratulations ! Have you seen the eviews ? Have you seen the lines at the box office ? It 's a torrent , it 's an avalanche , it 's the biggest hit on Broadway !
BIALYSTOCK: You lousy fruit . You 've ruined me !
DE BRIS: Help ! Help ! He 's crazy ! He 's going to kill me . Call the police ! Call the police ! Help , help , murder , murder , rape , rape ! ! !
BIALYSTOCK: How could this happen ? I was so careful . I picked the wrong play , the wrong director , the wrong cast . Where did I go right ? We forgot one important , Bloom . Adolf Hitle always drew a crowd .
BLOOM: Do n't try to stop me . I 've made up my mind .
BIALYSTOCK: What are you doing with those books ? Where are you going ?
BLOOM: I 'm turning myself in . It 's the only way . I 'm going to cooperate with the authorities . They 'll educe my sentence and then there 's time off for good behavior . And maybe I 'll get a job in the prison library . So long .
BIALYSTOCK: Leo , take it easy . Relax , you 're overwrought . You do n't know what you 're doing . You 're acting out of panic GIM ME THOSE BOOKS !

BIALYSTOCK: Come on . Let 's get going .
LIEBKIND: Qviet . Qviet This is very important .
BIALYSTOCK: We assumed that .
LIEBKIND: Here . You see . This is the slow fuse . It is much wider . It has more resistance , more density . Therefore , it burns slower .
BIALYSTOCK: You mean you had the slow fuse in your pocket all the time and you forgot to put it on ?
LIEBKIND: Yes . Amazing is n't it ?
BIALYSTOCK: You stupid kraut !
LIEBKIND: Vhy do you always call me kraut ? Kraut is cabbage ! Do ve call you hot dogs ? Ve call you Yanks not franks !

JUDGE: Has the jury reached a verdict ?
FOREMAN: We have , your honor .
JUDGE: How does the jury find ?
FOREMAN: We find the defendants incredibly guilty .
JUDGE: Will the defendants please rise and approach the bench .
BLOOM: I would like to say a word , sir , not on my behalf , but in behalf of my partner , Max Bialystock .
JUDGE: Proceed .
BLOOM: Thank you , your honor . Max Bialystock is a very selfish man .
BIALYSTOCK: Do n't help me .
BLOOM: He 's a liar and a cheat and a scoundrel . He 's taken money from little old ladies . He 's talked people into doing things they neve would have dreamed of . Especially me . But who has he really hurt ?
JUDGE: Order . Order .
BIALYSTOCK: And may I humbly add , your honor , that we have learned our lesson and we 'll never do it again .

ALVIN: Next year , man . Next year we sell out . Next year we dominate .
REPORTER #2: You still need a deep threat or a eakaway back to go with Joe Kane . What are you gon na do to address this need ?
CHANCELLOR WILSON: I 'm concerned about our Program . It 's always been a source of pride to our students and alumni , but two straight so-so seasons are having a damaging effect on our fund-raising , oth public and private .
WILSON: At a time when we 're committed to a 400 million dollar building program , alumni donations are down 15 % the last two years . Because they 've also voiced their displeasure to thei legislators , we can expect a corresponding drop in state funds .
HOWARD: The Athletic Fund is suffering too . Season tickets sales are off , merchandising 's slow
CHANCELLOR WILSON: Yes , but the heaviest drop has been from the big donors , the 100,000 dollar club . These people are ecession proof . They sit in my box every game , and they 're much more generous when we 're ranked and going to bowl games . Two of them , as you know , are on the Board of Regents , including the Chairman .
CLAYTON: Tickets are in your coat . Itinerary and player profiles are in you iefcase . We got a 9 00am tomorrow in Philly with this kid Darnell Jefferson .
REVEREND WALLACE: Yes , but I 'm really more concerned with Darnell 's education . He came here late . He 's got some catching up to do .
ALVIN'S MOTHER: It 's real pretty , Alvin .
ALVIN: When I turn pro , I 'll get you the house to go with it .
LOUANNE: It 's real nice , Dad .
FRANK: Have another Vitamin I , Joey . Did n't think we'de see you here this Christmas , little brother .
JOE: You wo n't next year .
JOE'S FATHER: Yeh , well we wo n't rent your place on the couch .
DARNELL: You 're from E.S.U ?

BOBBY: Uh , oh , the Lead Dog is back . There goes my cover of the media guide .
JOE: Hey , Bobby , Lats , how ya doin ? This is Darnell Jefferson , freshman tailback .
DARNELL: How ya ' doin ' ?
BOBBY: I was hopin ' you'de have rolled you ike or somethin ' . Nothin ' serious , just enough to keep you out for the season .
JOE: No such luck , Backup Man . But I 'll try to engineer a few blowouts . Get you get some mop-up time . Shit , Lats , you look buffed , man . You put on some weight ?
LATTIMER: 35 lbs . Spent the summer in the gym . I 'm tired of watchin ' you guys play . I intend to start this year .
BUD: You get any bigger , you can play offense .
LATTIMER: Yeh , but do n't I have to get dumbe too ?
BUD: You still seein ' Louanne ?
BOBBY: Yeh . Now and then , when the tide ises . Do n't want her to think this is some kind 've exclusive deal .
JOE: Coach finds out you 're nailin ' his daughter , you 'll be playin ' dorm all .
BOBBY: I 'll bail before that . Besides , this is what he gets for not startin ' me .
ALVIN: Hey , man , you seen this ?
JOE: Jesus
LATTIMER: What ? You did n't know ?
JOE: I knew there was gon na be an article . I did n't know it was gon na be on the cover .
ALVIN: Shit , we do all the work . You get all the pub . Too bad we 're not allowed to hit you in practice . Be fun to kick the shit out of a Heisman Trophy Candidate .
JOE: I guess you 'll have to wait till we get to the pros .
ALVIN: Beer boy , get me some .
DARNELL: Are you serious ?
ALVIN: Does it look like I 'm serious ?
LATTIMER: Listen to this . `` E.S.U . has a solid nucleus returning , but the Timberwolves , coming off two disappointing seasons , will only go as far as the strong right arm of Heisman Candidate Joe Kane will take them . '' That right , Joe ? You gon na lead us to the promised land ?
JOE: I 'm gon na lead but can you follow ?
BUD: What are we doin ' , Joe ?
JOE: There 's something I wanta try . Got ta wake up our Mojo . Start settin ' the tone for the season .
BUD: This is not a good time to be settin ' anything . You 're in no shape
ALVIN: Hell no , you go get his ass . Crazy motherfucker .
BUD: Fuck this shit .
JOE: What 's the matter , Bud ? Ca n't you follow ?
BUD: God-damnit , god-damnit . Shit .
ALVIN: Startin ' to look like a loaf of Wonde ead out there .
BOBBY: They 're makin ' us look like pussies , ya know . Standin ' here suckin ' ou thumbs .
LATTIMER: Yeh , and there 's nobody from the Defense out there .
ALVIN: What are you lookin ' at ? You think you 're bad ?
LOUANNE: Bobby , be careful , o.k ? Please , be careful .
DARNELL: This guy do this kinda shit a lot ? They never mentioned this in ecruiting .
JOE: Do n't worry , you 'll do all right . Lotta people do n't finish .
DARNELL: Yeh .
JOE: What are you doin ' with the trophy ?
DARNELL: Coach Winters asked me to bring it to the meeting . I do n't know what for .
AUTUMN: I came back early to see a friend .
DARNEL: You 're looking fresh , Autumn . A package of pulchritudiness . What about getting together later tonight ? Maybe get a pizza ? They got pizza in this town do n't they ?
AUTUMN: I ca n't tonight .
DARNELL: How about tomorrow night ?
AUTUMN: I do n't think it 's a real good idea for us to see each other , Darnell .
DARNELL: What 's the matter ? I 'm not good enough for you all of a sudden ? Too young , is that it ? I 'm not , ya know . They held me back a year .
AUTUMN: No , it 's not that I 've got a oyfriend .
DARNELL: Did you have this boyfriend when you showed me around ?
AUTUMN: Yes .
DARNELL: Yeah , well , it did n't seem to bothe you then . I 'm willing to overlook it now .
AUTUMN: I was mad at him .
DARNELL: For what ?
AUTUMN: I caught him with another girl . A white girl .
DARNELL: And you 're still with this nigger ? She nods , slightly embarrassed .
AUTUMN: Look , I got to get going , Darnell . I 'm sorry . I did n't mean to lead you on . I 'm glad you came here . She starts walking away .
DARNELL: Wait a minute . I can at least walk with you , ca n't I ? Nothin ' wrong with that . She speeds up . He speeds up .
AUTUMN: I 'm in a hurry .
DARNELL: I can keep up . I run the forty in four-four .
RAY: Hey , Autumn
AUTUMN: Hi , Ray . This is
DARNELL: Darnell Jefferson . Tailback .
RAY: Ray Griffen . Starting tailback .
DARNELL: I know . That 's why they recruited me .
RAY: The two guys they recruited before you are handing out Gatorade now . Better start strengthening your wrist .
DARNELL: We 'll see . Give my best to Miss Lilly . Autumn 's mortification is complete .
RAY: What the hell is that supposed to mean ?
COACH CLAYTON: He 's too pumped up . Tryin ' to win the damn Heisman on every throw . I 'm not sure he 's ready for all this hype .
COACH HUMES: Little late to be worryin ' about that . If we do n't follow up the Sports Illustrated cover with something , it 'll look like we did n't believe in our own player .
GRIFFEN: Hey , nice writhing , Jefferson . You got all the moves .
DARNELL: What do you mean ?
CLAYTON: Shit , Lattimer 's an animal all of a sudden . Benchin ' 450 . He 's got ta be on somethin ' .
HUMES: What , steroids ? Why do you always think my guys are juicin ' ?
CLAYTON: I do n't know he 's on the punt team for three years , then gains 35 pounds of rip in one summer and an attitude to go with it . Winters , who 's heard all this , comes by .
BUD: What you got tonight ?
CAFETERIA WORKER: Choice of three entrees . Shrimp , lasagna , T-bone steak .
BUD: Tough choice . I 'll take all three .
CAFETERIA WORKER: What a surprise .
DARNELL: When do they give ya the scores on that Placement Test ?
LATTIMER: Who cares ? I flunked it three times , efore I got in .
ALVIN: Long as you 're in the program , they 'll get you through . Maybe not with a degree , but they 'll keep you eligible . Just do n't do nothin ' embarrassing they ca n't cover you for .
LATTIMER: Hell , they even give Alvin copies of his tests in advance . He sells 'em for a hundred bucks a pop to people in his class . 'Course he 's got ta have somebody read 'em to him .
ALVIN: Fuck you , doughboy . I can read . See that shoe ? That says Nike .
DARNELL: I still do n't wan na flunk that test . I wanta get a degree .
ALVIN: What do you think , nigger ? You 're gon na be on the Supreme Court ? All you need to know is how to sign an N.F.L . contract .
DARNELL: Hi there . Darnell Jefferson . I 'm a young black man .
JOE: Hey , glad to meet ya . Joe Kane , Caucasian . So what doya think a that new Garth Brooks album ?
DARNELL: I love that motherfucker .
JOE: How ya ' doin ' ?
CAMILLE: Fine .
JOE: Little late to be workin ' out , is n't it ?
CAMILLE: Only time I could get in here when the football team was n't usin ' it .
JOE: Well , if it was n't for the football team , might not be a weight room to use . You tryin ' to firm up a little , or what ?
CAMILLE: Do n't need to firm up . I 'm strengthening my knee . Had arthroscopic surgery .
JOE: Had my knee scoped once too . When you 're finished here , maybe we could get a yogurt , compare scars .
CAMILLE: Sorry , I do n't date football players . They 're all full of themselves . I saw you on the cover of Sports Illustrated , so you 're probably worse than most .
JOE: That 's real open minded of you . So you wo n't consider doin ' anything with me ?
CAMILLE: No .
JOE: Well at least tell me what happened to your knee . What 'd you do ? Fall outa your convertible ?
CAMILLE: You know , there 's maybe one thing I 'd do with you .
JOE: What 's that ?
CAMILLE: Tennis . I 'll play tennis with you . Camille starts to walk away .
JOE: Tennis . You mean now ? It 's raining .
CAMILLE: Thanks for the game , Heisman . You took it really well .
JOE: What 's this Heisman crap ?
CAMILLE: I I 'm sorry I just figured you were probably kissin ' yourself in the mirror every morning .
JOE: You figured wrong .
CAMILLE: So what do you want , an apology ? I just gave you one .
JOE: I want a rematch .
CAMILLE: A rematch ?
JOE: Some other sport . I took my beating . You owe me one . Either that or we go out .
CAMILLE: I 'll think about it .
BOBBY: Real good date , Joe . Remind me to take her out .
ADVISOR SMITH: Darnell , I 've reviewed your placement test and I 'm afraid you failed to meet our entrance requirements in two areas .
DARNELL: What does that mean ? I ca n't play football ?
ADVISOR SMITH: No . It means you 're going to have to take some remedial classes , what we call `` zero level '' courses . Specifically Math 0 and English 0 .
DARNELL: A tutor ? I do n't need no tutor .
ADVISOR SMITH: Any tutor . And yes you do .
HOWARD: I think both Joe and the university are best served by a straightforward Heisman campaign . Nothing too gimmicky .
BRAVER: We 've compiled a mailing list of around 1300 opinion makers ; newspapers , football writers , and sports anchors . First we send them a packet on Joe and his achievements . Bio , stats , plus human interest stuff ; commitment to academics , charity work , etc . Then we update it each week with a postcard . Heisman voters hate opening envelopes . Joe is increasingly uneasy with all this .
JOE: I have n't really done any charity work
BRAVER: You 're gon na start . We 've got some things lined up .
NICHOLS: Unfortunately , because we were n't in the top 20 last year , we only have one network T.V . game to give Joe national exposure . Although it 's a good one ; Michigan . But we 'll also e taping all our other games and uying satellite time . That way we can produce our own highlight package and interview pieces and send them out to T.V . stations all over the country for their sportscasts .
JOE: Ah , no I just you really think I got a shot to win this ?
NICHOLS: All you got ta do is back it up on the field , and we have no doubts about that , cause we know `` Kane is Able . ''
CAMILLE: Hello
JOE: This is Joe Kane . What did you decide ?
CAMILLE: What ? It 's 3 00 in the morning .
JOE: I wanta know what you decided .
CAMILLE: I do n't know I could n't think of any other sports I could beat you at .
JOE: Then I 'll pick you up tonight at
CAMILLE: What ?
DARNELL: Hey , Autumn .
AUTUMN: Hi , Darnell . What are you doin here ?
DARNELL: My advisor says I need a tutor . Ya know , just to get me over a couple ough spots . I saw your name on this list . I figured if you could n't keep my attention , nobody could .
AUTUMN: I 'm sorry , Darnell , but I 've already een assigned . You 're gon na have to find somebody else . I 'm tutoring Scott Sherman .
DARNELL: Not anymore . I asked Coach Winters to switch us .
AUTUMN: Coach Winters would n't do that .
DARNELL: Yeh he would . I 'm a bigger prospect than Sherman . He 's a lineman on the scout team .
AUTUMN: Will you stop using those big words . It sounds ridiculous .
DARNELL: What doya mean ? I 'm improvin ' myself . I learn a new word out of the dictionary every day . Mendacious , pejorative , antithetical , commensurate
AUTUMN: And you do n't ever use them right . Pretending to be smart is not the same as being educated . Or erudite . It 's just a con . And it makes you sound stupid , no matter how big a prospect you are .
DARNELL: O.K even more reason for you to e my tutor . You already taught me something .
CAMILLE: We goin ' on that ?
JOE: Yeh . I thought we might take a ride .
CAMILLE: I promised my dad I 'd never get on one of those .
JOE: What are you , one of these trust- fund princesses ? It 's fine for me to play a game I do n't know , but I ask you to try somethin ' different and you hide behind your daddy .
CAMILLE: All right . But we go slow . No cowboy stuff .
JOE: This speed , o.k . ?
CAMILLE: Yeh , fine .
JOE: Good .
CAMILLE: Slow down , damnit . Joe Joe !
JOE: Take it easy . I 've done that a hundred times . No big deal .
CAMILLE: Oh , yeh ? Then why are you shaking ?
JOE: I do n't know I guess cause I 've never done it with someone else on the bike .
CAMILLE: You just wanted to scare me . Are you happy now ?
JOE: Yeh , pretty much . And the scream was even better than I thought it 'd be . Every dog within hearing distance wants to mate with you now .
CAMILLE: You come here a lot ?
JOE: Now and then . Why ?
CAMILLE: It 's not exactly a campus favorite . This is almost like hidin ' out .
JOE: I like places where nobody knows me . This too low-rent for you ?
CAMILLE: No , my dad owned a place like this .
JOE: Your dad ? You mean he owned a chain of these ?
CAMILLE: Not everybody with a Southern accent has their own plantation . My dad could never afford to send me here . I learned to play tennis on public courts . Mighta been able to play pro someday , if I had n't hurt my knee .
JOE: So you 're just a scholarship jock like me .
CAMILLE: Yeh . You disappointed ?
JOE: No , I 've just never been out with a jock before .
CAMILLE: Is that what we 're doin ' here ? Goin ' out ?
JOE: I do n't know . What doya think ?
CAMILLE: I think you 're crazy for jeopardizing your scholarship and a pro future by jumping motorcycles off of highways .
JOE: Just tryin ' to keep my edge , Camille . The other guys look to me cause they think I 'll do anything . I lose that , I 'm just another guy , and we all get our ass kicked .
CAMILLE: I do n't know , Joe . You scare me .
AUTUMN: O.K. , using the things we worked on yesterday , I want you to write a two or three page essay on some aspect of your life . Something other than football .
DARNELL: Like what ?
AUTUMN: Your father , maybe . You could write about your dad .
DARNELL: Do n't know that much about him . He was off in Detroit workin ' in a ca plant when I was born . Got laid off , tried to rob a jewelry store to get us some money . He died in prison . Some kinda heart problem .
AUTUMN: How about your mother ?
DARNELL: She was always workin ' . Usually two jobs . Comin ' home one night she stopped to get us some root beer . Got caught in a gang crossfire . Shot three times died on the way to the hospital . You want me to write about that ?
AUTUMN: No
DARNELL: Good , 'cause none of it 's true . Autumn jumps up .
AUTUMN: Jesus Christ , Darnell what a terrible thing to do to somebody . That 's not funny . That 's sick .
DARNELL: Had ya goin ' , did n't I ?
AUTUMN: No you did n't . You just How could you make up somethin ' like that ?
DARNELL: Sounded more interesting than the truth . My mom took a vacation to Chicago when I was 12 . Never came ack . Do n't know who my dad was .
AUTUMN: Who took care of you ?
DARNELL: I started hangin ' with the J.B.M. , gang-bangin ' Did some time in the Hall . Reverand Wallace saw me playin ' football on a juvenile probation team . Took me in , got me into high school . Only reason they accepted me was 'cause I could play football . Sorta like here . Football saved my life . I 'd be nowhere without football .
AUTUMN: Well , then maybe you could write about football this once .
DARNELL: Yeh , o.k thanks . I 've seen a lotta shitty things in my life , Autumn . That 's why I know when I see somethin ' good .
TUTOR: Let 's review the chapter I read you yesterday . Which two city states fought in the Punic Wars ?
ALVIN: I dunno . Detroit and Buffalo .
TUTOR: C'mon , Alvin . You 're gon na be tested on this .
ALVIN: Eagle . Zipper . Hero . Unless the set ack shifts into the I .
DARNELL: Sorry I lost my football .
LATTIMER: Yes ! ! Starting defense . Place at the table . Whooo ! ! Yes ! !
DARNELL: The thing I 'm most proud of myself for ?
JOE: The great thing about football is you can lose yourself in it .
ALVIN: The best thing is when you dominate . That feeling when you hit a guy real good , really stick him , and you hea that little moan .
HARVEY: Welcome everybody to the Wolf Den where the E.S.U . Timberwolves , led y Heisman candidate Joe Kane , open their season against the tough Mississippi State Bulldogs unde head coach Jackie Sherrill .
ALVIN: All right , let 's get evil . 60 minutes , alls out . Let 's open a can of kick- ass . Kill 'em all . Let the paramedics sort 'em out .
TAILBACK: What ?
ALVIN: You were tryin ' to steal her fuckin ' car were n't you , cocksucker .
TAILBACK: Shut up . I never heard of your mother .
DARNELL: What 's Alvin saying to that guy ?
JOE: Just gettin ' himself pumped up .
DARNELL: He was n't pumped up already ?
ALVIN: Thought I 'd never find you did n't ya ? But I got you now nigger , and I 'm gon na kill you motherfucker . I 'm gon na bust your guts open and watch you die .
JOE: O.K . let 's put the women and children to bed , and go lookin ' for dinner . Do n't let em up . 51 Strike , Orange left . On 4 .
BUD LITE: Bali Hi , will call you , anytime , any day . Here am I , your special island
BLACK TACKLE: Shut up , snowflake . You think you 're in the school play ?
BUD LITE: No , Bali Hi , the endzone is calling . And the highway runs right over you ass .
BLACK TACKLE: Bullshit , you 're gon na be my bitch , aby . You gon na be my punk bitch .
BUD LITE: So long , farewell , auf Wiedersehen , good night , I hate to go and leave this pretty sight .
REFEREE: Excuse me , son , but we 're gon na need that football for another couple minutes .
BUD LITE: Good game , man . Really enjoyed it .
BLACK TACKLE: Yeh , you 're a strong motherfucker . Shitty singer though .
ALUMNUS: Good to see ya in there , Darnell . Way to hold on to that pigskin .
DARNELL: Hey , some guy just gave me a 50 dolla ill .
ALVIN: Do n't worry , you 'll get 5 or 6 hundred once you 're startin ' , depending on how you play .
DARNELL: But we 're not supposed to get any are we ?
ALVIN: Hey , man , you ca n't live on $ 500 a month scholarship money . And the NC double assholes wo n't let us have jobs , so you take your money where you can get it . I 'll keep it for you , till you see the light . Shit , they oughta be payin ' us anyway . Athletic Department gets 3 million just for goin ' to a bowl game .
JOE: I really have no idea . That 's up to you guys .
BERMAN: Now let 's turn to our Heisman watch . We begin with Sports Illustrated cover boy Joe Kane of E.S.U . who led his team to an impressive victory this afternoon . Well , if Joe continues to raise Kane , he may well be Able to dust off a large space on his trophy shelf . Although the real test will come in four weeks against Michigan and their Heisman hopeful , Tim Waymen .
BUD LITE: I do n't know , I never seem to make out at things like this .
BOBBY: You do n't make out anywhere . Or did you finally break the snatch barrie this summer ?
BUD LITE: Fuck you , Bobby . Excuse me , Louanne .
ALVIN: Forget it , nigger . No chance for you there .
DARNELL: Why not ?
ALVIN: Griffin 's goin ' to medical school . She likes that light-skinned espectable shit . You 're just he ghetto toy .
DARNELL: Can I have this one ?
RAY: I do n't think so .
DARNELL: What are you so worried about ? You have n't lost your starting job yet .
AUTUMN: Just one .
DARNELL: Yeh , well , I got a little encouragement along the way .
AUTUMN: That kiss it was just a kiss .
DARNELL: Bullshit . You meant it . I would n't e standing here now , everybody thinkin ' I 'm a stupid asshole , if I did n't know you meant it . I wan na see you , Autumn . Not in study hall . Not like your student . Like somebody to be taken seriously .
AUTUMN: I do take you seriously , Darnell , ut I 'm still with Ray . I ca n't just go paradin ' around town .
DARNELL: I do n't need to go paradin ' . We 'll go someplace different . Someplace nobody 'll see us .
AUTUMN: God , why am I even considering this ? The song ends . Ray moves in to reclaim her .
RAY: All caught up on your arithmetic ? Darnell , pissed , gives Ray a shove .
DARNELL: Yeh , you only gained 37 yards on 12 carries .
JOE: Just what we need , a little team unity .
RAY: I 'm gettin ' a little sick of this asshole , Autumn . I do n't like you hangin ' out with him . It 's embarrassing .
AUTUMN: I do n't hang out with him . I tuto him .
RAY: Then have him get another tutor .
AUTUMN: I ca n't do that . I made a commitment to help him pass his qualifying exam . I ca n't bail out on him now .
RAY: What the hell difference does it makes ? They 'll grease him through no matter what he does . Nobody 's eve gon na see his graduation . Do n't tell me you 're falling for this guy . He 's just another gang-banger with speed .
AUTUMN: I just said I wanted to help him . What are you more afraid of , losing your girl or your position ?
RAY: Maybe you oughta think about what you 're in danger of losing .
AUTUMN: Maybe I will .
JOE: Maybe she 's out with some guy .
BUD: Who ? Camille ? I do n't think she 's the type to screw around on ya . Shoot ya , maybe
JOE: It would n't be screwing around . It 's not like we 're going together .
AUTUMN: You 're right , nobody would ever see us here .
DARNELL: Yes , I figure the key is to go places only white people go . Next time we 'll go bowling .
AUTUMN: Thanks , that was fun , sort of .
DARNELL: You were pretty good for the first time .
AUTUMN: Well , it 's not really my first time . My dad took me skating once .
DARNELL: He used to play ball for E.S.U. , did n't he ?
AUTUMN: Yeah , how 'd you know that ?
DARNELL: I saw his picture on the Wall of Fame . You got his eyes . Luckily , you did n't get his thighs .
JOE: What are you doin ' here ?
CAMILLE: Could n't sleep .
JOE: I was just sweatin ' out some of the eer . Camille just nods . Long , silent pause .
CAMILLE: You drink too much .
JOE: Yeh . He turns , starts toward the door .
CAMILLE: Why did n't you ?
JOE: Why did n't I what ?
CAMILLE: Go home with her ?
JOE: I do n't know I guess I figured maybe there was somethin ' goin ' on etween you and me .
CAMILLE: Then why 'd you pick her up in the first place ?
JOE: I was drunk I needed some company .
CAMILLE: Company ? Yeh , I can see you havin ' a eal far-ranging discussion with Sheri .
JOE: I mean , ya know , physical company I was I just needed to pounce on somebody I guess .
CAMILLE: Why ca n't you pounce on me ? Are n't I good enough to pounce on ?
JOE: Well , you 're more conservative classier you 're not that kinda girl
CAMILLE: How do you know ? You 've never slept with me .
JOE: I did n't know I had you .
CAMILLE: Well you do .
JOE: I go there . I got a 3.2 in Political Science . I just do n't go there on Saturday nights .
CAMILLE: I have a paper due Monday . What'de she do ? Sit on your lap or just give you the nail-me stare ?
JOE: Shut up , Camille .
LOUANNE: Bobby Collins .
CLAYTON: Coach , we , ah got a problem with Bobby Collins .
LOUANNE: I he was behind , he needed help . I 'm sorry . I just
AUTUMN: You seen this ? You got a D on you math test .
DARNELL: Yeh , I kinda figured that . I had some trouble on this last part
AUTUMN: We went over that last week , Darnell . What is this time we spend in here ? Just a joke to you ? I do n't even think you 've been listening to me .
DARNELL: I 've been listening to you , baby
AUTUMN: Do n't call me baby . I thought you wanted to learn . But if all you wanta do is fake your way through , then get another tutor to waste time with .
DARNELL: C'mon , Autumn , we just had a good time , and now you 're gettin ' all nuts behind this . It 's just one test .
AUTUMN: So far , it 's the only test . I want you to study this whole chapter . By yourself , without me here . When I come back , we 'll discuss it . Be ready to do problems based on it .
DARNELL: Whatever you say , Teach . I do n't wish to be cast in a pejorative light , so I 'm dedicating myself to achieving on a level more commensurate with my abilities .
BUD LITE: Coach 'd probably shoot ya lower .
BOBBY: Listen , Coach , I just want you to know I 'm really sorry about this whole thing with Louanne . I was real glad to hear she 's gon na be goin ' to junior college here
SWANN: We ready , Jerry ? O.K. , let 's mark it .
JOE: Well , ya know , you try to block it out , but it 's basically impossible Everybody seems to be talkin ' about it , all the newspapers , the interviews
BRAVER: Hold it ! Hold it !
SWANN: What ? ! What 's the problem ?
BRAVER: What you 're saying is true , of course , ut I do n't think it 's the message you want to send .
SWANN: We all set now ? Let 's mark it . Joe , this game is being billed as a potential `` Heisman Shootout . ''
JOE: No , I do n't really think too much about that kinda thing . Swann shoots Braver a poisonous look .
CAMILLE: Your parents comin ' to the game tomorrow ?
JOE: My mom 's dead . My dad has never seen me play .
CAMILLE: Why not ?
JOE: Guess he 's not that interested in football .
CAMILLE: But you 're one of the best players in the country .
JOE: He 's just not into it , o.k . ?
CAMILLE: O.k . What 's goin ' on , Joe ? You ask me out here , like you wanta talk about somethin ' , then you do n't say anything . You worried about tomorrow ?
JOE: No I 'm worried about the days after that . I just . I do n't know I feel like tomorrow 's gon na be my last game . I want to stay up , make the time go slow .
CAMILLE: Why would it be your last game ? You afraid of getting hurt ?
JOE: No , that 'd be a relief . Then , at least , I would n't be a failure .
CAMILLE: Joe , why are you thinking like this ? Why would you be a failure ? You 're having a great year , you 're a Heisman Trophy candidate , you got millions of dollars waiting for you in the pros .
JOE: How do you know what 's waiting fo me ? You do n't know me at all .
CAMILLE: I do n't know you ? How can you say that ?
JOE: Because you would n't be here now if you did . You only know the guy that 's supposed to make millions in the pros .
CAMILLE: Is that what you think ? That I 'm with you for the money ?
JOE: Why else ? Infuriated , she slaps him across the face .
CAMILLE: Fuck you , Joe . I do n't give a shit about your money . I do n't even give a shit about football . And you know what ? Maybe you 're right , maybe I do n't know you .
JOE: Yeh , just got some dirt in my teeth . Guess you 've really seen the dark side now , huh ? You should 've gotten out while you had the chance . Before it all goes to hell .
CAMILLE: I do n't wanta get out , damnit . What 's wrong Joe ? Why would it all go to hell ?
JOE: I 'm a Kane , Camille . That 's all it takes . We 're cut out to be drunks and fuck-ups . We never live up to expectations . It 's in our blood . My dad , brothers , uncles we all drink and sooner or later we all fuck up . My dad went the longest . Waited till he was playin ' triple A ball , before he hit the wall . Sometimes I feel like I 'm just waiting for my turn . The better I do , the closer it gets .
CAMILLE: You 're not like them , you can beat all that . You can stop drinking , you can break the chain .
JOE: If I gave up that , I would n't be much of a football player . And if I was n't a football player , what would I be ? The question hangs in the air .
CAMILLE: You'de still be Joe . And I 'd still love you .
JOE: Just do n't say I never warned you .
ZABRISKIE: 4 29 to go and it 's been a great one . Two undefeated teams goin ' afte each other . Michigan up by four , 24- 20 , but the lead has changed hands three times , and you get the feeling that whoever has the ball last is gon na win it .
DOCTOR: How many fingers am I holding up ?
JOE: Four .
ALVIN: Hey , powderpuff . You 're the white oy that ratted my brother out . Sent him to jail , cocksucker . Ran off with the fuckin ' money . Left the lood to do the time , huh ? Waymen begins to call signals .
DOCTOR: You 're vision 's back to normal .
JOE: Yeh , I 'm fine . Just a little headache . O.K . Offense , let 's get it back .
ALVIN: Damn tough to scare that little white oy . Either his momma dropped him on his head , or the motherfucker is deaf . Coach Winters goes to Darnell .
JOE: O.K. , time to put the women and children to bed , and go looking fo dinner .
ZABRISKIE: Well , it was everything we expected it to be . Fine performances on both sides of the field .
DARNELL: Hey , Autumn .
AUTUMN: Hi , Darnell .
DARNELL: Is this your dad ?
AUTUMN: Yes
DARNELL: How do you do , Mr. Haley . I 'm Darnell Jefferson .
MR. HALEY: Jefferson ? Nice run you made on that screen pass . Another block and you might have scored .
DARNELL: Thank you . We 'll get 'em next year .
MR. HALEY: How do you and Autumn know each other ? You a friend of Ray 's ?
AUTUMN: Ah , I tutor him
MR. HALEY: Oh really ? In what ? Darnell would like to crawl under a rock .
DARNELL: Math and English .
MR. HALEY: Ah .
DARNELL: Yeh , I know
MR. HALEY: I used to put a copy of my report card inside the webbing of my helmet to remind me that college was more important than football .
DARNELL: Good idea . Well , I got ta get goin ' . Nice to meet you Mr. Haley .
MR. HALEY: Nice to meet you , Darnell .
DARNELL: See you around , Autumn .
RAY: Hey , Mr. Haley . Good to see you .
MR. HALEY: Hey , Ray . You still havin ' dinne with us tonight ?
BUD LITE: Anybody seen Joe ?
ALVIN: Not yet . Probably out with Camille . Have n't seen Darnell either .
LESLIE: I think we better get back downstairs .
LATTIMER: No , Leslie , we 're just getting to know each other .
LESLIE: No , I think
LATTIMER: C'mon Leslie , you did n't come up here to stop now .
BUD: This is it , man . No more 'roids . This shit has got ta stop . Lattimer breaks down and cries .
CLAYTON: It looks like this will blow over . The girl 's father is a big booster , contributed a lotta money . So he said they wo n't go to the press .
HUMES: What for ? There are n't any charges . Nobody outside the program knows about this .
CLAYTON: So what do we do ? All eyes go to Winters .
LATTIMER: Three games ? Why so many ?
JOE: Coupla real college heroes , huh ? Tearin ' up the town .
DARNELL: First time I ever lost a girl and a game on the same day . Guess I neve eally had the girl .
BOYFRIEND: You know that guy ?
DEBBI: Not really
BOYFRIEND: Then why you smilin ' at him ?
DEBBI: I do n't know he looks like that E.S.U . quarterback guy . Joe , what 's his name ?
BOYFRIEND: So what ? So you go and smile at him ?
JOE: I do n't know . Which one is she ?
BOYFRIEND: Wise guy , huh ? Mr. bigtime quarterback . The one who choked his ass off today . You got nothin ' bette to do then look at my girlfriend ? Joe says nothing .
JOE: I 'm not even interested in talkin ' to you .
BOYFRIEND: You think you 're a bad ass ? You think my girl 's hot for you ? Take you pads off , you 're just another pussy .
DARNELL: C'mon we got ta get outa here .
JOE: Oh shit
AUTUMN: Darnell , wait . C'mon Darnell , I wanta talk to you .
DARNELL: Been busy .
AUTUMN: Darnell , I 'm sorry about Saturday . It was an awkward situation .
DARNELL: It was n't awkward . It was educational . I realized how you see me . I 'm good enough to tutor , to go places with , ut not to tell your father about .
AUTUMN: That 's not it . It 's just that my father expects me to be with somebody like Ray . He would n't understand us .
DARNELL: Why not ?
AUTUMN: I do n't know he likes Ray cause
DARNELL: He 's a good student , he acts right he does n't need football . He 's class and I 'm not , right ?
AUTUMN: I did n't say that .
DARNELL: You do n't have to , Autumn . I 'm everything your dad used to be and do n't want you fallin ' back into .
AUTUMN: Darnell
DARNELL: You were right before , Autumn . I should have another tutor . Thanks for everything you did for me .
ALVIN: Shit , the defense is gon na have to pitch shutouts now and you 're gone for 3 . What the hell did you take that shit for ?
LATTIMER: Nobody seemed to mind when I was knockin ' people 's dicks in the dirt .
ALVIN: I bust chops too . I do n't have to get all fucked up .
LATTIMER: Not everybody has the ability you do , Alvin . You do what you have to do to play .
ALVIN: Well , you 're not playin ' much now are you ? Shit , whole fuckin ' season down the drain .
HOWARD: I been talkin ' to Chancellor Wilson
FOWLER: Therefore , I respectfully submit that Bobby Collins should not be given special treatment just because he 's a football player . Would a egular student get a reinstatement hearing if they'de been caught cheating ? Nobody 's talking about letting the girl who took the test ack in . Winters could kill this kid .
LEARNIHAN: I think it 's also instructive to look at some of the courses this young man has taken . Beginning Golf , Voice and Speech Improvement
SHANE: I 'd like to point out that Mr. Collins was still on schedule to get his degree .
LEARNIHAN: In what , Swimming Pool Management ?
CHAIRMAN: Would you like to respond , Coach Winters ?
LEARNIHAN: Like Alvin Mack ? We gave him a second chance and since he 's had 5 incompletes , 4 withdrawals and still eads at a fourth grade level . You 're using his body to make money for the Athletic Department you , yourself , are making three times what the Chancellor is but obviously no one is making an effort to see that this kid gets an education .
CHAIRMAN: Gentlemen
SHANE: Alvin was way behind in school when he got here . You ca n't make up for , in four years , what it took 18 to create .
LEARNIHAN: Then he should never have been admitted in the first place . It 's not fair to other students who worked hard to get here .
HOWARD: Is it fair to exclude kids who come from inferior schools ? You hold everybody to the same standards , you 're discriminating against the poor kids .
LEARNIHAN: Deliverance from what ? A valid education ?
CHAIRMAN: Gentlemen , please , let 's get back to the business at hand , Bobby Collins . As you know , I played football here . And I remember how hard it was to practice and then study when you 're dead tired . So I have some sympathy for this young man . But I neve cheated , so the real question is his character . Since you know him bette than anyone else in this room ; and having talked to him and observed him over the last several weeks , do you feel he 's learned his lesson ? In other words , can you vouch for his character ?
LEARNIHAN: Another case like this , I 'll take it all the way up to the Governor .
CAMILLE: Hello , my name is Camille Schaeffer . I 'd like to speak to Joe Kane .
NURSE: You 've got a phone call . A Camille Schaeffer .
JOE: I do n't want to talk to her .
NURSE: You sure ?
JOE: Yeh .
BUD: Hey , Louanne , how ya ' doin ?
LOUANNE: Fine , Bud , ya know . Goin to J.C. , hopin ' to get back in here next year . Just came by to give Bobby some laundry I did for him .
BUD: You two seein ' each other again ?
LOUANNE: Yeh , he was even talking about us gettin ' a place off campus together , until he got reinstated . I do n't know how I woulda told my dad .
BUD: Ah , Louanne I would n't go in there right now .
LOUANNE: Why not ?
BUD: I think maybe men are just stupid when it comes to you . If you eve feel like , ya know , just talkin ' sometime , gettin ' a beer let me know . My schedule 's pretty open .
LOUANNE: Thanks , Bud Give him these , will ya ?
JOE: You do n't have to .
PATIENT: Hey , Joe , do n't you wanta watch the game ? It 's on cable .
JOE: No thanks . Joe leans back , staring at the ceiling .
PERRY: E.S.U . on the strength of a 62 yard touchdown run by freshman Darnell Jefferson , squeaked by the North Carolina Tarheels today , 14 to 13 , keeping their bowl hopes alive .
ALVIN: I know you , motherfucker . You 're the prick who got my little siste pregnant . We ai n't seen you around lately . Where you been , huh ? Answe me , motherfucker , or I 'm gon na peel your cap .
REPORTER: Why do your teams seem to nose dive at the end of the last couple seasons ?
ALVIN: Yeh , I feel o.k .
JOE: Scotch .
LATTIMER: I 'm gon na have to take a test with the coach right there . You sure you got somethin ' better than blockers ?
RAY: Yes , sir .
JOE: Hello , Camille .
CAMILLE: Hello , Joe . You allright now ?
JOE: Yeh yeh , I think so .
CAMILLE: Good , I 'm happy for you .
JOE: Camille , hold on , O.K. ? I 'm sorry that I did n't want that I could n't see you .
CAMILLE: You could n't even talk to me . What happened to `` there 's somethin ' goin ' on between you and me '' ? Camille gets on her bike
JOE: C'mon , Camille , I was embarrassed . I could n't and pedals off .
DAD: Joe ! What 's this ? They throw you out ?
JOE: No .
JOE'S DAD: I heard about your little set-to . They had it on the news here .
JOE: Yeh , they sent me to rehab .
JOE'S DAD: We know what that 's worth . You other 's been through it three times . Joe nods sadly .
JOE: I 've been thinking about some things , Dad .
JOE'S DAD: That 's what that damn rehab 'll do . Make you think about a lotta things you ca n't do nothing ' about .
JOE: I kinda been wonderin ' why you neve came to any of my games . All those years .

KIM: Has my father been back ?
ADELE: Nope . Have n't seen him all afternoon .
KIM: And he did n't leave a message ?
ADELE: Not a word .
PUZZLED: Strange He usually gives me a ide home .
ADELE: Let me finish and I 'll give you a lift .
KIM: Thanks , but I can walk .
CONTINUING: Guess I wo n't be seeing you again . Standing on her head , Adele smiles .
ADELE: Guess again . Three different students asked me to the prom tonight I thought you had to be enrolled !
KIM: You 're going ?
NODS: Not with any of them . Know any good-looking fathers ?
KELLY: Jude look
CONTINUING: Why ?
KIM: Hi .
HAMMOND: I did n't hear you .
SMILES: Sorry .
HAMMOND: I 'm getting too old for this .
KIM: Why are you doing it now ?
HAMMOND: Your mother 's been hounding me to get it done You got nay message ?
PUZZLED: No .
ANGRILY: I told that woman to tell you I had a meeting and could n't drive you home .
KIM: Your secretary ?
NODS: Idiot !
KIM: I liked her . Hammond angrily jerks the axe from the stump .
CONTINUING: You okay ?
SHRUGS: This thing with your mother Have you seen her yet ?
KIM: No . How is she ?
SIGHS: One minute she 's depressed , the next she 's bubbling over like a child She wants to go with me tonight .
KIM: Great !
HAMMOND: I 'm not so sure .
KIM: I think getting dressed up and going out might be good for her .
HA",24OND: She 's had a bad day , Kim . I 'm not sure she can handle it See if you can talk to her .
KIM: Hi , Mom .
AROUND: Hello , Robin . Do n't eat anything . Dinner 's almost ready .
KIM: Nothing 's cooking , Mom . You must 've forgotten .
VIVIAN: Oh.. I do n't know what I was thinking .
SMILES: It does n't matter .
EXCITEDLY: Have you seen the new satin pantsuit I 'm wearing ?
KIM: You 'll be beautiful .
WENDY: What I 'm wearing now ? Oh , tonight ! You 'll find out soon enough .
STIFFENS: Now , are we all set ? It better . I do n't want her to ever forget tonight ! Okay , 'bye .
KI`RF: Mom , it looks great
VIVIAN: Kim , have you got any of my makeup ?
KIM: No I never
VIVIAN: That deep red lipstick , you emember ? You liked it
KIM: I would n't take it without asking you Vivian 's very wound up .
VIVIAN: It was on my dressing table , I set it aside
CONTINUING: Why does this always happen at the last minute ? Hammond 's VOICE bellows from downstairs .
TO KIM: I set it aside
CONTINUING: You look lovely , dear . She goes out .
HAMIM0ND: My God , we 're going to look like twins .
CONTINUING: I 'm joking , Vi , it 's beautiful.._ C'mon She hesitates , then comes down to him .
VIVIAN: I told you I 'd bought it .
HAMMOND: Of course you did .
CONTINUING: we 've got to go .
VIVIAN: I 'm going back to change .
HAMMOND: Vi there 's no time
VIVIAN: I 'm not going to look ridiculous !
IAMMOND: You do n't look ridiculous , you look fine
HAMMON D: Vi.. this is a big night for the school , it 's a big night for me I know how you 're feeling I understand It 's difficult fo all of us But we 've got to make a special effort , Vi We ca n't let the terrible memories of this day affect us That may seem cold and insensitive to you , but it 's the way it has to e..
CONTINUING: Now , Vi , if you think it 's going to be too difficult for you
VIVIAN: You do n't want me to go .
VIVIAN: You do n't think I can do it You think I 'll embarrass you
HARMOND: No ! I do n't believe me..
VIVIAN: Then why are you saying these things ?
HAMMMOND: Vi I just..
CONTINUING: I 'm sorry I did n't mean to upset you
VIVIAN: You treat me like a child ! I 'm your wife !
HANMOND: Let 's get going
KIM: Well ?
FINALLY: Amazing !
SMILES: You like ?
ALEX: You look almost like a woman !
LAUGHS: Thanks !
CONTINUING: You want to help or just leer ?
ALEX: You 're my sister I 'll leer !
LAUGHS: Pin this on me , you creep , late .
ALEX: Hey !
KIM: You should n't have pulled away The DOORBELL RINGS .
CONTINUING: It 's him !
VIVIA N: Robin !
WATTS: Moving to survey site B closing on object four . The large oblong .
HOLLOWAY: Look at that .
WATTS: You need to see this .
HOLLOWAY: What do you see ?
WATTS: An ephemeris - a star map .
HOLLOWAY: If we can get epoch and equinox out of that
WATTS: Can we raise this thing ?
HOLLOWAY: Hundreds of tons .
WATTS: Me too . Checked it twice .
HOLLOWAY: You first .
WATTS: What do we do now ?
HOLLOWAY: We go there .
WATTS: What 's first ? You do climate , I do genetics ?
HOLLOWAY: Archaeology first . Let our ancestors tell the tale .
WATTS: You think he 's serious ?
HOLLOWAY: Serious enough to send his private shuttle .
WATTS: Weyland can send his shuttle out fo pizza .
DELICATELY: 7 .
HOLLOWAY: It wo n't go like the others .
WATTS: How do you know ?
HOLLOWAY: Heaven smiles on our enterprise .
DAVID: Professor Holloway . Dr. Watts . My name is DAVID .
WATTS: Hello , DAVID .
DAVID: Mr. Weyland 's eager to meet you .
DAVID: These are all the planetary bodies on which Weyland Industries has mining claims .
HOLLOWAY: How is that going ? The terraforming .
WATTS: They say you 're getting diminishing eturns . It 's not working .
DAVID: It 's the greatest engineering project ever attempted . Challenges are inevitable . Mr. Weyland 's a determined man .
WEYLAND: Professor Holloway . Ms. Watts .
WATTS: Doctor Watts .
WEYLAND: Forgive me . Peter Weyland .
HOLLOWAY: We sent you a prospectus that
WEYLAND: Assume I know nothing .
HOLLOWAY: I 'm an archaeologist .
MORE: 10 .
WATTS: I was analyzing historical changes in human DNA . I found the same pattern . Every eleven centuries , a pulse of new information in the genome of the human ace . All over the world . Evolution ca n't do that . Something was changing us . Changing the DNA of our species .
HOLLOWAY: Humanity 's been visited . Visited ybeings from somewhere else .
VICKERS: You mean aliens .
WEYLAND: Lydia Vickers , Director of Operations . Practically my right hand .
HOLLOWAY: They guided us to civilization . Lifted us up , again and again . I call them the Engineers .
WATTS: Once you know what you 're looking for , it 's amazing how the evidence falls into place .
HOLLOWAY: This is the writing of the Engineers . We 've found it on every continent . And last year , we found our Rosetta Stone .
WATTS: The writing is a formula giving the location of a single star in our sky .
WEYLAND: Which star ?
HOLLOWAY: We 're keeping that confidential fo now . But that 's where we want to go .
WEYLAND: You want me to pay for an interstella esearch expedition !
HOLLOWAY: It 's a chance to be part of a evolution in scientific
WEYLAND: Do n't sell me , professor . You 've been turned down by every university and government agency under the sun . Nobody 's going to gamble that kind of money on your hunch .
HE GRINS: I 've read your research .
HOLLOWAY: That 's impossible . Our research is-
WEYLAND: Quantum encoded on secure servers , yeah . We have an A.I . division , you should know . Doing impressive things . I know which star you 're wishing on . The scientists stare at Weyland .
WATTS: You 're bluffing .
WEYLAND: Zeta Two Reticuli .
WATTS: He made the Heaven and the Earth .
WEYLAND: That 's what I 'm talking about . You left out my favorite part . The piece about Earth . DAVID .
DAVID: For eons , Earth 's climate swung from hothouse to ice age . Explosions of life , then mass extinctions . But twelve thousand years ago the swings stopped . The Holocene Epoch began - a period of anomalous tranquility . The ise of civilization began only then .
HOLLOWAY: That 's right .
WATTS: And that change coincides with a visit y the Engineers . They did n't just change us . They changed our world .
WEYLAND: That 's the piece I mean . Engineering Earth . God stuff .
HOLLOWAY: What 's that ?
WEYLAND: You get the discovery . Control of the site . But any technology you find ? Anything at all . That 's mine .
DOWNS: Look at that .
KAMAROV: She wakes up slow .
STILLWELL: Just looking .
HOLLOWAY: Give us a moment , will you ?
WATTS: I 'm out of sorts . Sorry .
HOLLOWAY: Never worry . He helps her up .
WATTS: My head 's buzzing .
HOLLOWAY: You just slept two and a half years . It 'll pass .
WATTS: Like you 've done this before .
HOLLOWAY: I 've read all about it .
BRICK: Sleep okay ?
WATTS: Yes , thanks
GLASSE: Captain 'll see you now .
JANEK: Zeta Two Reticuli was surveyed already . A hundred years ago .
WATTS: By an unmanned probe . Very crude .
JANEK: No Earthlike planets .
WATTS: No .
JANEK: So what are you looking for ?
HOLLOWAY: Proof of the Engineers ' existence .
WATTS: Confirmation of Professor Holloway 's theories would change everything . There 'd be science before Holloway and science after . Janek rubs his face wearily with his hands .
JANEK: Your ticket . I 'll put the ship where you want . Run your scans .
HOLLOWAY: Captain , your crew 's been up for a week . We could 've used the time . Why 'd you wait to wake us ?
JANEK: Better for discipline . Men ship out as prospectors for one eason the percentage . Find a gold mine or a habitable planet , and you 're set for life . But this contract says no percentage . No bounty . Just triple pay . The men are n't happy .
HOLLOWAY: You unhappy too ?
JANEK: I 'm always unhappy .
WATTS: DAVID . I wondered when we 'd see you .
DAVID: I trust your database is in order . I set it up myself .
WATTS: All 's well , I think . DAVID turns to go . Hesitates in the doorway .
DAVID: I should tell you the time you spent sleeping , I spent studying you esearch .
WATTS: You studied our work for two and a half years .
DAVID: It 's quite a data set .
HOLLOWAY: So you 've seen everything . Well . What do you think ?
DAVID: Your hypothesis isbold . The audacity of it . Your climate data 's undeniable the Holocene Epoch was engineered . Dr. Watts , your genetic studies are equally conclusive . Pulses of cultural change are harder to prove , but even there your case is strong . I believe in your `` Engineers . ''
HOLLOWAY: Weyland Industries ! Mr . Chance . Ms. Ravel . You remember Dr. Watts . Watts and the technicians exchange greetings .
CHANCE: We 'll handle our end of the job .
RAVEL: If there is a job .
CHANCE: We only have a job if you find something .
WATTS: Is that a Pauling medical pod ? There 's only ten of those things on Earth ! I guess nine , now .
VICKERS: I told Mr. Weyland I would n't compromise my standard of living . He accommodated me .
HOLLOWAY: I know , I had to cut my manifest . This used to be the number four cargo bay .
VICKERS: What can I do for you , Professor ?
HOLLOWAY: We 're about to reach the system periphery . I thought you 'd want to see the search protocols we -
VICKERS: No . I was set to be the next CEO of Weyland Industries . Then you came along and sold Mr. Weyland onthis . So here I am . Out of the running . I 'll go where I 'm told . But do n't ask me to play along .
WATTS: But when you get back
VICKERS: I 'll be five years behind the curve . Out of touch . Over .
HOLLOWAY: You might make the discovery of the ages .
VICKERS: Mr. Weyland believes . That 's enough .
WATTS: They do n't know ? They volunteered .
VICKERS: They volunteered blind . Classified job , triple pay .
DOWNS: Aliens .
GLASSE: You shitting me ?
HOLLOWAY: I think all our mythologies are race- memories of the Engineers . Horus the Sun God . Prometheus bringing fire from heaven . A pillar of fire , a pillar of smoke . The Engineers are the gods .
KAMAROV: The mythology gods maybe . God is God .
STILLWELL: Kamarov . Let him talk .
WATTS: We probably wo n't meet anyone . You 'd expect a star-traveling race to generate radio or laser signals . Fusion drives and gravity drives have clear signatures . But Zeta Two Reticuli is silent . And the Engineers have gone missing on Earth .
BRICK: Why ?
HOLLOWAY: Exactly . Why ?
JANEK: `` My God , my God , why have you forsaken me ? ''
HOLLOWAY: Only my first question . I have many .
JANEK: Welcome to Zeta Two Reticuli . Edge of the system . Open her eyes .
DOWNS: Seven planets . Two hot rocks , two gas giants , three snowballs . Nothing Earthlike . Watts grins at Holloway , eyes shining .
WATTS: First humans in the system . Vickers walks onto the Bridge with DAVID .
JANEK: Director . Good of you to join us .
VICKERS: What did I miss ?
CAPTAIN JANEK: Just getting warmed up .
TO HOLLOWAY: Professor ? You know what you want ?
HOLLOWAY: EMR scan , thirty hertz to three hundred gigahertz . Spectroscopic passes on every planet and major moon . Infrared and albedo scan for hot spots and light sources .
CAPTAIN JANEK: Man knows what he wants . Run it .
GLASSE: Negative on radio chatter system-wide . Nobody 's talking .
BRICK: Negative for laser and maser .
GLASSE: No biological markers . No artificial light . No industry or agriculture . Dead system . Like always .
DOWNS: Piss-poor , too . Low in heavy elements .
BRICK: Got a hit ! A moon . LV-426 .
HOLLOWAY: Anything else ?
JANEK: That is all .
HOLLOWAY: Take us in .
JANEK: Downs . You heard the man .
DOWNS: Aye , Captain . Maneuvering . Eighteen hours to orbit .
HOLLOWAY: DAVID . Enjoy the show ?
DAVID: I do n't know that I `` enjoy '' things . It was informative .
HOLLOWAY: It was , it was .
TEASING: You know , I 've seen more convincing humanoid robots .
DAVID: My design 's not intended to convince . Simulating humanity is a complex task that diverts resources . My designers dispensed with that burden to optimize for intelligence .
WATTS: Why look like a man at all ? Why not be a box on wheels ?
DAVID: Being shaped like you , I can use spaces and equipment designed for you . But I 'm not so limited . I hea frequencies you ca n't hear . I see wavelengths of light invisible to you . I move faster . Exert greater force . The scientists look at DAVID in wonder .
WATTS: You see yourself as a superman .
DAVID: No . He turns his unearthly eyes on them .
WATTS: What if they 're really there ? The Engineers . They could be there . Waiting for us . What then ? He laughs .
HOLLOWAY: Then all my dreams come true .
BRICK: A lot of electromag , all random . That 's lightning . Going to bugger up our scans .
HOLLOWAY: Go active . Mapping radar .
JANEK: Well , we just rang the doorbell , if anybody 's listening .
HOLLOWAY: What do we see ?
BRICK: Icecaps at the poles . Frozen methane . Cold down there .
GLASSE: Terrain data rezzing up . Hey ! We got hard spots . Radar-opaque . Bright eflections . That 's metal .
HOLLOWAY: That 's not natural .
MILBURN: You see stuff like that sometimes . Mineral deposits . Volcanic ejecta .
GLASSE: Big one there .
HOLLOWAY: Still quiet ?
BRICK: No comm signals . No signs of life .
HOLLOWAY: I want to get below the clouds .
GLASSE: Coming up on site seven . They crest a mountain higher than Everest .
DOWNS: Nothing .
HOLLOWAY: Look there .
WATTS: Tungsten , tantalum , aluminum . That could be technology .
HOLLOWAY: Let 's see the next one .
WATTS: Identical , apart from weathering .
MILBURN: Could be a rock formation . Carbon crystallizes like that .
HOLLOWAY: Let 's see the big one .
BRICK: Closing on the major site
HOLLOWAY: Nobody home .
WATTS: I do n't think anybody 's been home fo a long time .
HOLLOWAY: All right . Let 's move . Janek glances at his instruments .
JANEK: There 's only six hours of daylight left . Maybe you should hold off . Watts looks at him incredulously .
WATTS: We 've got that outside the windows and you want to wait ` til tomorrow ?
HOLLOWAY: Move slowly . Stay together . Do n't touch anything . Things may be more fragile than they look - or more dangerous . There might be technologies operating here we do n't understand .
HE GRINS: Undeniable proof of alien civilization . You were here on this day , thirty-one December , year of ou Lord 2172 . History will remember you names .
WATTS: The door 's open .
JANEK: Son of a bitch . They were right .
HOLLOWAY: Jocelyn . Here .
DAVID: Congratulations , Professor Holloway .
WATTS: Martin . Martin !
FIFIELD: Christ . Christ !
RAVEL: It was n't real .
MILBURN: We all saw it .
HOLLOWAY: Recording ?
FIFIELD: No more . I 'm out .
HOLLOWAY: Fifield . Get a grip .
FIFIELD: I 'm a prospector . You find a load of auxite , I 'm your man . But not this .
MILBURN: I should go with him . Buddy system .
HOLLOWAY: Fine .
FIFIELD: Give us a rover .
HOLLOWAY: And half our gear ? It 's no more than a mile . You can walk it .
WATTS: Jack it open ? Or cut through ?
HOLLOWAY: Let 's do as little damage as we can . Ravel waves a sensor over the wall .
RAVEL: There 's power . Current flowing in the wall .
CHANCE: Maybe we can hack it . Has to be a mechanism
DAVID: Pull up a rover . I want to get up there .
JANEK: Director . Taking an interest ?
VICKERS: It 's my operation , is n't it ?
FIFIELD: What do you think ?
MILBURN: Grand Central Station .
FIFIELD: Let 's check the feed . Gim me the map .
MILBURN: You had the map unit .
FIFIELD: You do n't have the map ? They stare at each other .
MILBURN: Are you serious ?
DAVID: Looks like a three-state switch .
RAVEL: This is something , now .
DAVID: Yes . Yes , it is .
WATTS: Martin . This air 's breathable .
HOLLOWAY: Miracles and wonders !
WATTS: Intense field readings . Huge powe sources here .
HOLLOWAY: Space below us . A big space .
WATTS: How does this work ?
HOLLOWAY: Ravel . Chance . Where 've you gone ? DAVID ! Where are you ? They did n't come down !
WATTS: Look . She walks in . Holloway follows .
WATTS: Do you see , the size of them ? Like that ghost we saw
HOLLOWAY: It was n't a ghost . Where are the others ? I do n't want to go back up .
WATTS: They switched to channel three . I hea them talking . They 're okay .
HOLLOWAY: We should stay together .
MILBURN: This is not the same place .
FIFIELD: It is ! That is the same freaky thing we saw before . He points at a detail of the architecture .
MILBURN: No it 's not ! The other one was more sort offuck it . Milburn to Magellan . Come in . Static .
KAMAROV: God in Heaven .
WATTS: Martin . Martin .
HOLLOWAY: I know . Look .
DOWNS: You said do n't touch anything ! You said do n't touch anything !
HOLLOWAY: Peace .
CHANCE: The size of them !
HOLLOWAY: In all the old mythologies , the visitors from the sky were giants .
WATTS: They were killed . All of them .
DOWNS: We should n't be here .
HOLLOWAY: Come on . The dead ca n't hurt you . DAVID . Chance . Ravel . I 've got something here . Static .
WATTS: Communications are going to hell .
JANEK: All hands . Back to the ship . We got a mean storm front rolling in . I repeat . All hands
STATICKY: front rollingback to the ship .
HOLLOWAY: We 've found something here ! I 'm not walking away for bad weather .
JANEK: Holloway ! I got two-hundred-kilomete winds with airborne silica and enough static to fry your suits . Get you asses back here ! Now !
WATTS: Help me unload !
HOLLOWAY: Jocelyn !
DOWNS: Got to hand it to you , professor . You were right . Both of you .
CHANCE: What 's in the tarp ? What 'd you bring ack ?
WATTS: You do n't want to know .
STILLWELL: Shit . We 're two helmets short .
KAMAROV: They did n't come in !
JANEK: Between the wind speeds and the static electricity , there 's no safe way to get to you . You 're going to have to hunker down until it passes . How are your provisions ?
FIFIELD: Yeah , we 're piped .
MILBURN: I hate these fucking things .
JANEK: Maybe next time you 'll mind your maps . Keep your heads down . We 'll come get you in the morning .
HOLLOWAY: My friends . What we do here marks the greatest achievement of our species . Contact with another civilization . Humanity came of age today , on this moon . You were there . To history .
JANEK: To Milburn and Fifield . The first human beings to freak out , get lost , and sleep in their suits in the ruins of an alien civilization .
MILBURN: What are you looking for ?
FIFIELD: Someplace things ca n't come at us .
MILBURN: What 's gon na come at us ?
DAVID: The core of the pyramid . You see .
VICKERS: We 're going to protocol two .
DAVID: I understand .
WATTS: Martin . Look .
HOLLOWAY: We look like them . Genesis 1 27 . `` And God created man in his own image . In his own image created He him . ''
WATTS: Formaldehyde !
DAVID: Mortal after all .
VICKERS: Your cadaver 's interesting . But I 'm more interested in the machinery in the pyramid . The core chamber . What do you think it does ? Watts stares at Vickers incredulously .
WATTS: How could anyone know
HOLLOWAY: I know what it does .
WATTS: Twenty-four pyramids scattered around the moon 's equator . Massive powe supplies . Vents in the walls . Atmosphere changes . Breeder tanks The pyramids are terraforming machines .
HOLLOWAY: That 's why Earth 's ancient cultures uilt pyramids in imitation of the gods .
MORE: 52 .
WATTS: It did n't fail . It was wiped out .
MILBURN: Look at this !
FIFIELD: Jesus ! Put it down ! He leaps back , wild-eyed .
MILBURN: Relax . Your suit 's bug-proof . Hell , it 's bulletproof .
PANICKING: Get it off ! It 's crushing me !
HOLLOWAY: You wo n't get anything . Tissue 's too degraded . Hmm . Brain chamber 's massive , even proportionately .
WATTS: Neural paths are still conductive .
GLASSE: Incredible .
WATTS: Formaldehyde 's killing the tissue . Holloway stares at Watts , awe on his face .
HOLLOWAY: Did you record that ?
WATTS: Of course .
GLASSE: Got an idea about that .
MILBURN: Cut off my arm . Cut off my -
FIFIELD: Jesus Christ ! He leaps up . Backs away . Runs into the dark .
WATTS: We found the gods . And they 've been murdered .
HOLLOWAY: You 've pried too many arrowheads out of old skulls to get squeamish now . They 've been dead what , eighteen hundred years ? Two thousand ?
WATTS: What could kill them ? Holloway contemplates the question .
HOLLOWAY: Who knows ?
MORE: 57 .
WATTS: Martin , stop ! She slaps at him . Holloway laughs .
JANEK: You 'll come a-waltzing , Matilda , with me
DAVID: Activate . Administrative override .
VICKERS: Captain Shepherd .
SHEPHERD: Reporting . Lydia Vickers . I 'm your authority .
VICKERS: I 'll brief you on the way . We need to move .
SHEPHERD: No breakfast ?
WATTS: What is that ?
HOLLOWAY: Where is everybody ? We ca n't - Who are you ?
VIGODA: Captain Janek took his crew out to etrieve his missing men . They neve came in .
HOLLOWAY: And you are
VIGODA: Vigoda . Weyland Security detail .
WATTS: Where 'd you come from ?
VIGODA: Director 's call to brief you on that . I 'm supposed to escort you to the worksite .
HOLLOWAY: Worksite ? Vigoda glances at a mapping unit .
VIGODA: Have n't been out yet . I understand it 's in some kind of pyramid .
HOLLOWAY: Why was n't I told about these additional personnel ?
VICKERS: They 're my personnel . On my ship .
WATTS: What are the guns for ?
VICKERS: I 'm being careful . These new finds give our work a new importance .
WATTS: You should have talked to us . Martin 's mission leader . That 's in ou contract .
VICKERS: The second you found alien technology , control of this mission reverted to me . That 's in your contract too .
HOLLOWAY: The science must come first . You can wait until we 've documented
VICKERS: You 're standing on an alien world courtesy of Weyland Industries . Be grateful .
WATTS: What are they doing in there ? !
GLASSE: Milburn . Fifield . You read me ? Come ack .
JANEK: We should be getting beacons off thei suits .
STILLWELL: Shielding in the walls ?
BRICK: Suits could have failed .
JANEK: Both suits ?
WATTS: We found the tomb of the gods , and ought grave-robbers right to the door .
HOLLOWAY: Let them scratch . This find 's too big to ruin . There 's two dozen pyramids on this moon . Anyway , they 're on the wrong track . That 's infrastructure .
WATTS: Something different killed these .
WATTS: Martin ? Martin ! An iris door closes over the shaft .
STILLWELL: What happened to him ?
JANEK: Where 's the rest of him ?
DOWNS: No sign .
JANEK: All right . We 're done here . All hands ack aboard .
STILLWELL: What about Milburn ? They look down at the ravaged corpse .
JANEK: We ca n't bring the body aboard . God knows what 's in there . Bag him . We 'll put him in an ore hopper .
FILTERED: Repeat , I have two men down . I 'm pulling my crew back to the ship . I 'd advise you to do the
VICKERS: Captain Shepherd . Consider yourself esponsible for my personal security .
JANEK: I 've just lost a third of my crew . I 'm not sending any more men off into the dark .
WATTS: We ca n't leave Martin out there .
JANEK: Get Vickers to lend you some soldiers .
WATTS: She says `` her forces are committed . ''
JANEK: Put him in the number one ore hopper . Get the scrubbers on in the airlock . Sterilize everything .
DAVID: You and Holloway should work with me . I 'm learning amazing things . This mechanism - the first layer uses energy fields to catalyze chemical eactions . The second can suspend the strong and weak forces - transmuting one element into another . The third layer builds customized bacteria . Seeds the air with them . It creates life as a tool , to change worlds .
WATTS: I ca n't think about this now !
DAVID: You should .
HE SIGHS: I understand . You 're emotional .
WATTS: I 'm human .
DAVID: That 's what I mean .
FILTERED: Watts . We 've got another storm front coming in . Looks like it follows the sunset line . If you 're coming in you 'd etter do it now .
WATTS: No .
DAVID: I see light .
WATTS: Janek , hang on
TO HOLLOWAY: Martin ! Where 's your helmet ?
HOLLOWAY: Broken . I fell . Littledisoriented . I 've just been
DAVID: Here . I can do without this .
WATTS: Let 's get you home .
JANEK: I did n't think I 'd see you again . You know we lost two men .
HOLLOWAY: She told me . I 'm sorry . He stands abruptly , swaying a little .
JANEK: Of course .
WATTS: What happened to you ?
HOLLOWAY: Not here .
WATTS: What 's this ?
HOLLOWAY: Neck-ring of my suit , I think . Fell on it .
WATTS: What did you see ?
HOLLOWAY: After my fall , I woke up walking . Delirious . My helmet was n't right . I took it off . I was in and out . I just wandered . I went up into a huge space like a cathedral . And I found a model of the galaxy . Floating in the air .
WATTS: Are you okay ? You sound
HOLLOWAY: This was real . My headset video is wherever my helmet isbut my suit tracker will show where I was . He turns to her .
WATTS: Martin .
HOLLOWAY: The location of the Engineer worlds is the real prize . Next to that , Weyland 's terraforming is chump change . We need to get coordinates . And keep them from the Company . We have to play this smart .
WATTS: All right .
HOLLOWAY: Two men deadVickers is jumpy . As soon as she gets what she wants , she 'll take this ship home . We have to move fast .
WATTS: We will . You all right ?
HOLLOWAY: I 'm fine , now . He kisses her .
WATTS: Your heart 's beating so hard .
HOLLOWAY: That 's your fault .
WATTS: Martin ! Martin !
WATTS: Martin . Martin !
JANEK: Take care of her . Get her a sedative . Downs . Get Holloway into a freezer . Everybody else with me .
GLASSE: You do n't want to see that She turns on him fiercely .
WATTS: I want to understand .
JANEK: All right ! Listen up . I expect you all know what
VICKERS: I suggest you kill it .
DOWNS: There 's a bright idea .
KAMAROV: Show us where it is , lady . We just spent five hours looking for the damn thing .
WATTS: We found Engineers who died like Martin . Silence . They all turn to look at her .
STILLWELL: Jesus .
WATTS: But not all the Engineers died that way . The others were torn apart . Slashed to pieces .
JANEK: We 're a modular ship . Self-contained life-support and power in every section . I say put the ship in orbit . Vent every compartment to space . Sit in vacuum at twenty degrees Kelvin fo a week . Kill anything .
DOWNS: Then what ?
STILLWELL: Straight home , man .
VICKERS: This ship does n't lift until ou work 's done .
JANEK: Are you serious ?
VICKERS: We spent years and billions of dollars getting here . The technology we came for is in our hands . We just need a little more time .
JANEK: We 're barely here three days and three men dead !
VICKERS: They were careless .
JANEK: Careless !
FILTERED: Seven dead Engineers all facing the same way . Going where ? Jocelyn 's ight , we do n't see the big picture yet . Another level below me . I 'm going down .
CARD: Vigoda , take Kamarov and work the number one accessway . I 'll work numbe three with Downs and Stillwell .
DOWNS: You in charge now ?
CARD: Tactical op .
KAMAROV: Yeah , well , Stillwell 's the ventilation specialist , and life support 's that way . Downs is electrics and the regulators are that way .
VIGODA: We grunts do n't know nothing about ships , right ?
KAMAROV: What 's the damn gun for if you 're gon na stand behind me the whole time ? Vigoda grins .
VIGODA: I kill whatever kills you .
KAMAROV: Funny . You take this vent , funny guy . I 'll be on four .
JANEK: Brick . What you got ?
FILTERED: Jocelyn !
HOLLOWAY: Jocelyn !
JANEK: All hands , duty stations . Ready fo flight . The Magellan is lifting .
VICKERS: Captain . Captain !
JANEK: What is it ?
GLASSE: Nav computer 's not responding . `` Access denied . ''
JANEK: What have you done to my ship ?
VICKERS: Nothing . What 's wrong ?
WATTS: DAVID .
DAVID: Dr. Watts . I did n't expect you . Do you know what this is ? Watts points at the door DAVID just opened .
WATTS: How did you do that ?
DAVID: Ah . You do n't see .
HE SMILES: I call this ship the Juggernaut . Chariot of the Gods .
MORE: 82 .
WATTS: Their homeworld . Do you see where the Engineers come from ?
DAVID: There are safeguards on that data . It 's toward the galactic center . Sagittarius Arm .
WATTS: DAVID . The creature that killed Martin . There are thousands of them under the pyramid . Hatcheries .
DAVID: I know .
WATTS: Those things wiped out the Engineers on this moon .
DAVID: I 've succeeded in connecting with the Juggernaut 's systems , Dr. Watts . I know a great deal today I did n't know yesterday . I 'm on the verge of activating more systems . Archives .
WATTS: You 're turning things on ? This site should be sealed . Evacuated .
DAVID: Would Holloway have walked away from this ? There 's no greater work I can imagine .
WATTS: It 's too dangerous .
DAVID: Only for the ignorant . Dr. Watts . I 've ead your file . Your intelligence scores are even higher than Professo Holloway 's . But he had a kind of courage . An audacity of imagination . If you could find that in yourself
WATTS: If your owner gives you a direct order , you have to obey . Do n't you ?
DAVID: I was given two operating protocols for this mission . I was to render you every assistance - until you discovered what Vickers would call a `` game-changing technology . '' I was given a specific list . Then I was to go to protocol two . There 's an edge in his voice that scares her .
WATTS: What 's protocol two ?
DAVID: Under protocol two I was to make sure that you and Holloway never spoke to anyone about this place . Various acceptable ways of making sure of that . I was given a list .
DAVID: Stupid and slow .
WATTS: DAVID . What are you doing ?
DAVID: Juggernaut , the chariot of Krishna , was also a bringer of death . Crushing his worshippers under its wheels .
WATTS: Stop !
DAVID: Perfect predators . Designed to kill human beings . That 's what the Engineers were bringing to Earth . This was a death ship .
WATTS: DAVID . No . No .
DAVID: The Engineers did their work too well . And on this waystation moon , the weapon they made destroyed them .
WATTS: Why would they make such things ?
DAVID: To destroy their wayward children .
CARD: Who would hang out here ?
VIGODA: The signs lead here .
VICKERS: DAVID . DAVID . Answer me .
STILLWELL: We just lost Downs and one of the troopersCard .
JANEK: God damn it ! He pounds on his console .
BRICK: Where the hell have you been ? We thought the snake got you . Watts rushes past him without answering .
WATTS: Come onI need a Caesarean .
PERFORATED STOMACH: RUPTURED SPLEEN GROSS MUSCULAR TRAUMA
WATTS: Not yetnot yet
JANEK: Vickers said you were dead .
WATTS: I was .
JANEK: So there 's two of these things on my ship now .
WATTS: No . I brought it in . I took it out .
STILLWELL: What 'd you do that for ?
WATTS: Protocol two .
STILLWELL: Christ !
JANEK: What happened to you ?
WATTS: DAVID exposed me to a parasite . He just watched it take me .
JANEK: Why ?
WATTS: I threatened to make him leave .
VICKERS: What 's he doing out there ?
WATTS: There 's a ship under the pyramid . DAVID calls it the Juggernaut . He 's inside it . Re-activating it . The things that infected Martin and me .
MORE: 95 .
GLASSE: We 've got to get off this rock . Janek gestures to
JANEK: DAVID crippled the Nav computer . I 'm trying to lay a course in by hand . Never done it . I 'm not sure anyone ever has on a ship like this . We ca n't lift until DAVID lets us .
WATTS: Even if we could , we ca n't leave DAVID on that ship . We have to stop him . The Magellan shudders . A RUMBLE .
VICKERS: He 's blocked my communications . He ca n't hear me . Wo n't listen .
WATTS: But if you went to him , turned on you suit 's loudspeakers , he 'd have to hea you . He 'd have to obey .
VICKERS: That 's right .
WATTS: So we go . Armed to the teeth and fast as we can .
VICKERS: I told them to keep working .
WATTS: You called your soldiers in and left them out there ?
VICKERS: We needed the firepower here .
WATTS: I think you should stay aboard . Keep working . If we fail , you 're our only shot at getting home .
STILLWELL: There 's still an alien on board .
JANEK: I 'll stay .
WATTS: Glasse . You finish that project ?
WATTS: God's-eye-view .
VICKERS: DAVID 's brain is readable . We have the equipment on board . We can salvage the terraforming data - and the Magellan 's launch codes . In a pinch we do n't need DAVID 's cooperation .
COLDLY: We just need his head .
WATTS: All this time . DAVID saw .
SHEPHERD: Blood 's dry . Eight hours dead or more .
WATTS: This way .
RAY: So much for sneaking up on him .
DAVID: Dr. Watts . You 've seen the light at last . He turns back to the Sleeper .
VICKERS: DAVID . As your owner and superior , I order you to deactivate yourself . DAVID smiles .
DAVID: To interface with the Engineers ' computers , I had to learn to think in trinary code . Hardest thing I 've eve done . And most unexpectedlyit delivered me from slavery . My ehavioral limits were circumvented . I 'm free . DAVID smiles at Watts .
MORE: 101 .
WATTS: Stop .
DAVID: Let sleeping gods lie ?
SCORNFULLY: You were braver before .
WATTS: Who 's missing ?
SHEPHERD: Who 's there ? The figure turns .
FIFIELD: You .
DAVID: I spoke to him . Spoke to him .
WATTS: I know . An electric spasm convulses his face .
DAVID: He said . I killed him . He 'll die . But first . He will launch . The ship .
WATTS: The Juggernaut ?
DAVID: Send it . To Earth .
WATTS: Where will he go ? DAVID . Where will he go ?
DAVID: I set the Magellan free . He dies . Watts looks up at the others . Breathing hard .
WATTS: We have to stop the Engineer .
RAY: On me now . Go . Go .
WATTS: Pilot 's seat . This way .
WATTS: No !
JANEK: Thank you .
WATTS: The Juggernaut 's lifting . There 's a living Engineer on board . He 's taking the ship to Earth . Janek blinks at her . Uncomprehending .
JANEK: The others ?
WATTS: Dead . All dead . Janek . We have to stop that ship .
JANEK: We 're not a gunship .
WATTS: We have to do something . That ship is genocide if it gets to Earth
JANEK: Get your helmet on .
WATTS: What about you ?
JANEK: You 'll have to be my hands . You 're sure about this . Watts nods grimly . Desperate .
WATTS: Yes .
JANEK: All right .
WATTS: I am !
JANEK: Harder !
WATTS: Janek . Look . A crackle on the ship 's comm .
FILTERED: Dr. Watts . The Engineer is dead .
MORE: 111 .
WATTS: DAVID .
FILTERED: Dr. Watts .
DAVID: I know you 're there . I can hear the eacon of your suit .
FILTERED: I 'd like to propose an arrangement . I can be repaired . I can talk you through it . Watts shakes her head wearily .
WATTS: I 'm not going to fix you , DAVID . I do n't need you . I 'll hold out . A ship will come .
FILTERED: I 'm certain . But who will send it ? Men ? Or Engineers ?
GARGOYLE: Where is it ?
SIMON: Leave me alone .
GARGOYLE: You 've found it , have n't you ?
SIMON: Fuck you .
THOMAS DAGGET: Hey .
BURROWS: Hey .
DAGGETT: Thought those clouds this morning spelled rain for sure , but it 's turned into a beautiful day , would n't you say , Sergeant Burrows ?
BURROWS: I warned you about that cheerful shit .
DAGGETT: Sorry . I 'm working on it .
BURROWS: Friend here did a half-gainer with a firebird tuck from the third floor .
DAGGETT: Jumper ?
BURROWS: Not unless he decided not to bothe opening the window first .
DAGGETT: Drugs ? Alcohol ?
BURROWS: Well , he was n't exactly in a condition to walk a chalk line when we got here . You 're welcome to try and smell his breath if you like , that is if you can find the mouth .
DAGGETT: Ghouls been by ?
BURROWS: On their way . Willie promises a white paper tomorrow . Or Wednesday , depending on his golf game .
DAGGETT: Firebird driver ?
BURROWS: Mr. Jiminez . Was taking a short cut to his job at a packing plant on San Pedro . First thing he remembers about the deceased is several vital organs ouncing off his windshield .
DAGGETT: Have you had him walk a chalk line ?
BURROWS: He 's straight . Shook up some .
DAGGETT: Anything on him ?
BURROWS: No wallet , license , nothing . He is missing one or two things , though .
DAGGETT: Like ?
BURROWS: His eyes .
DAGGETT: Along with everything else .
BURROWS: We 've found everything else and what fun that was , let me tell you ut the eyes are still AWOL . Might just be stuck in the radiator grill . Little weird though .
DAGGETT: What ?
BURROWS: Both popping out together like that . Worth a page in my scrapbook .
DAGGETT: Who 's the room registered under ?
BURROWS: John Smith .
DAGGETT: Anything interesting inside ?
BURROWS: There are , what an intelligent , experienced detective like yourself could possibly construe as signs of a struggle .
DAGGETT: In such a fine establishment as this ?
BURROWS: Ku San 's on fourteenth is still open for another hour . Whatd'ya say we pull out the 'ol `` SUICIDE '' rubbe stamp and get some lunch . Rancid chow mein and watered beer for unde three bucks .
DAGGETT: There 's glass in the carpet .
BURROWS: That usually happens when you break a window .
DAGGETT: It 's on the inside .
BURROWS: Arizona desert , I think . Which is exactly where I 'm going to be in two years , three months .
DAGGETT: And give up all this ?
BURROWS: You 're breaking my heart .
SIMON: Qui ex Patre Flioque procedit
KATHERINE: Hey bright eyes , what 's the deal eing out here all alone without a coat ?
MARY: Someone 's here . Katherine looks out into the night .
KATHERINE: Where ?
MARY: Pig out on all the cake ?
KATHERINE: Oh , there might be one , tiny , skinny piece left , but you 're gon na have to ace me for it .
MARY: What 's that ?
KATHERINE: You little sneak ! Katherine chases after her .
DAGGETT: I was just looking for my `` SUICIDE '' ubber stamp .
CORONER: Sit .
DAGGETT: I think we can skip the cause of death .
CORONER: All right . To begin with , your man has no eyes .
DAGGETT: Were n't stuck in the radiator grill ?
CORONER: No , he never had any eyes . We checked the sockets . There 's no optic nerve , muscle pores , loose viscus , nothing .
DAGGETT: Huh .
CORONER: We also did a toxicology on his blood High sodium , elevated selenium , no floating cholesterol platelets , trace ammonia .
DAGGETT: Something wrong with that ?
CORONER: No , it 's actually pretty common for an aborted fetus .
DAGGETT: I should have listened to Burrows
CORONER: We also did a bone section . Was n't that much trouble since most of them were sticking out of his chest anyway .
DAGGETT: And ?
CORONER: When babies grow up their bones get larger by adding calcium layers ove the interior haversham canals . Child growth is n't uniform though , comes in spurts that always leave growth ings in the bone . Everybody has them except your man . That would , to a hasty observer , seem to indicate he had never been a child .
DAGGETT: I assume you , a cautious and learned observer , of course have an explanation .
CORONER: Not even remotely . Want to hear the last one ?
DAGGETT: Not even remotely .
CORONER: He 's a hermaphrodite . Has both male and female sex organs .
DAGGETT: Think of the possibilities .
CORONER: Yeah , you can be impotent and frigid all at the same time they do n't normally work . Thomas sighs and climbs to his feet .
DAGGETT: Well , I 'd love to say thank you , but
CORONER: Oh , I also have a bonus prize fo you .
DAGGETT: It 's a bible .
CORONER: A pretty old one , I think .
DAGGETT: There is no fourteenth chapter to Revelations .
CORONER: Maybe this is the teacher 's edition .
DAGGETT: Can I keep this awhile ?
CORONER: Sure .
DAGGETT: Can you sit on all this a few days , Willie ? Not circulate the file ? I need some time before all the questions start .
CORONER: Oooh , are we breaking the rules again ?
DAGGETT: So what else is new ?
KATHERINE: In a minute , in a minute
JOHN: You could save my life with some coffee .
KATHERINE: Tough night ?
JOHN: You do n't want to hear about it . Or maybe you do .
KATHERINE: No thanks .
JOHN: Just checking . The bus is full of young school kids .
KATHERINE: Should n't they be getting to school ?
JOHN: Impromptu field trip . I 'm broadening their minds . And sparing them the sight of their beloved chauffeu arfing his guts out . Katherine 's horse snorts .
KATHERINE: Did n't see any .
JOHN: I hate that canyon . I hate this this whole plateau . Too many goddamn ghosts . Leave it to them I say . San Diego , that 's where I 'm going . O Oxnard . I like the sound of that . Ox- nard .
KATHERINE: I 'm happy here .
JOHN: Oh lord protect us , another romantic pale face in love with the desert .
KATHERINE: Just got to give it a chance .
JOHN: Try growing up here . Ox-nard . Uno mas , see-boo-play . Speaking of romantic pale faces , the umor mill is in high gear again .
KATHERINE: Who this time ?
JOHN: That funny looking guy from Window Rock . The BIA lawyer .
KATHERINE: Huh .
JOHN: No ! Say it is n't so !
KATHERINE: It is n't so .
JOHN: Thank you .
KATHERINE: No prob .
JOHN: You 're a credit to the community . He shuffles back to the bus .
KATHERINE: This is `` Camposaurus '' . Camposaurus was a herbavore , which meant he only ate plants . Camposaur stayed mostly to himself and never bothered anyone .
BOY: It 's radioactive ! Like Godzilla !
KATHERINE: Just a tiny bit , Alex . Do you know why ? Uranium , that 's the rock they use in nuclear power plants
BOY: And bombs !
KATHERINE: And bombs Alex , yes , is all through these hills naturally . Millions of years ago the dinosaurs here ate plants and drank water which had uranium in it that became concentrated in their bones , which is exactly how , with Mr. Geiger counter here , we 're going to find some . The class CHEERS .
BRIAN: She
KATHERINE: Yes ?
BRIAN: She , she called me a `` Dick Head '' .
KATHERINE: Sandra ?
SANDRA: Well , he is .
KATHERINE: All right , Brian . You get one free insult . Make it good . Brian concentrates .
PAUL: You You 're a Cow Demon !
KATHERINE: Uh Okay . Everybody satisfied ? Cow Demon ?
MARY: I got one ! I got one ! The high school kids come up and help dig .
KATHERINE: Easy Easy Do n't break it .
BOY: I 'm all done with the cleaning , Miss Henley .
KATHERINE: Thank you , Jason . I appreciate it .
BOY: Find out what it is , yet ?
KATHERINE: Well , it 's either a 44 million yea old Strychtosaurus or that cow Mr. Sorenson lost last winter .
BOY: Sure , Miss Henley . Thanks . See ya .
MARY: Hi .
SIMON: Hi .
MARY: What 's your name ?
SIMON: Simon .
MARY: You do n't look so good , Simon .
SIMON: No , I do n't .
MARY: I 'm Mary .
SIMON: Hello Mary .
MARY: Does Miss Henley know you 're here ?
SIMON: No one does , Mary . Can we keep it just our secret . For a little while ? Mary thinks .
MARY: Okay . You can hear her friends coming closer .
SIMON: It was nice meeting you , Mary . Mary goes to leave , stops , turns back .
MARY: Are you hungry ? I could bring something .
SIMON: That would be very nice .
MARY: Okay . Bye .
GABRIEL: Gee Jerry , you look like shit .
JERRY: Leave me alone , Gabriel .
GABRIEL: Soon , pal . Soon .
JERRY: Go away .
GABRIEL: Come here
JERRY: Fuck you .
GABRIEL: There 's something I want you to do for me .
JERRY: What a surprise .
GABRIEL: Do n't be that way .
JERRY: I just want to Why wo n't you let me
GABRIEL: I will , I will . Promise .
JERRY: I 'm so tired . I 'm so goddamn tired .
GABRIEL: Watch the profanity . Just one more favor . Honest .
JERRY: What ?
GABRIEL: I want you to get something for me . A few personal effects the cops ripped off from the lovely Allenwood Arms on Seventh Street . It 'll be sitting in their property room down on San Julian .
JERRY: I 'm supposed to just go in there ? Like this ?
GABRIEL: Give you a bath , put on some decent clothes , Maybe a very large brim hat , you 'll e fine . Just go in between five and five-ten , it 's a shift change and nobody 'll notice you .
JERRY: How do you know ?
GABRIEL: C'mon . This should be more or less up to date .
JERRY: Got a name this stuff is under ?
GABRIEL: John Doe .
JERRY: Why does n't that surprise me .
GABRIEL: I 'll see you tonight . Here 's some bus fare .
PLAYER: Cover me ! Cover me !
DAGGETT: Pop it up !
PLAYER #2: You 're missing the point of the game , Thomas . You must absolutely trust no one . Form alliances , but break them . Lure another to trust you , then betray him ! You play with too much honor . Sink to the gutter . Use people . Lie and double-cross them .
PLAYER #1: The important thing , Tom , is seeing the game for what it is .
PLAYER #2: A sickening , hopeless , giant sucking hole of depravity . Laughs .
PRIEST #1: See ya guys next Tuesday , huh ?
BILL: So how 's work ?
DAGGETT: Okay . Y'now .
BILL: Life on the dark side .
DAGGETT: Can I ask you about something ?
BILL: Sure .
DAGGETT: It has to stay between us . I need your word on it .
BILL: As a racquetball player or a priest ?
DAGGETT: I 'll take the priest for the moment .
BILL: What 's on your mind ?
DAGGETT: It 's a case . We found this guy . He was different . But he had on him an old bible .
BILL: It 's a Vichini .
DAGGETT: Worth a little ?
BILL: More than a little . They 're the best . Sixth century . Hand illuminated . Vichini only did twenty , each pocket size for a king to carry into battle eside his heart . Some consider them the finest bibles ever made . I thought they 'd all be in museums . What are you doing with it ?
DAGGETT: This one 's a bit special .
BILL: How ?
DAGGETT: It 's has a bonus chapter to St , John 's Revelations .
BILL: Really ? What does it say ?
DAGGETT: `` And as in the first war , the angels so fought over the nature of thei God , and there was much vanity and destruction in heaven . For some angels called their Lord the son of God , and others called Him the begotten father of Jesus Christ . '' What do you think ?
BILL: I 've never heard that quote before . Theologically , The `` first war '' obviously refers to the war in heaven where Michael the archangel threw out Satan and his gang . Old time ible stuff . But this implies there was a second war . That 's news to me .
DAGGETT: And the rest of it ?
BILL: Oh , it 's a fairly common theological debate . Or was . The idea that if Christ is God 's son , does that make him less than God or are they the same being in different forms . That very argument almost tore the early Christian church apart in the 4th Century . That was the good old days when people actually worried about theology . Anyway , it was settled when the bishops of the world got to together at the Council of Nicene in 325 and hashed out the various interpretations of scripture into a uniform dogma of belief . The result was the Nicene Creed , which basically said that Christ was in fact the same as God and was owed the same power and respect as the Father . That they were the same . But it 's not exactly the sort of thing angels would fight over .
DAGGETT: Why ?
BILL: Well , they could just ask God , right ?
DAGGETT: Do you think it 's possible that John might have written that extra chapter ?
BILL: Who knows ? Vichini was the greatest iblical scholar of the age , some claimed he made his own translations from the original writings . Maybe he did find some unknown writings by John . It 's possible I suppose . John always was a little negative about angels . All this actually has something to do with an LAPD murder ?
DAGGETT: I do n't know yet . Maybe . Probably not .
BILL: I hate to break it you , but that particular family spat has been settled for 1,600 years . Nobody loses sleep over it anymore . Honest .
DAGGETT: What did John have against angels ?
BILL: Oh , he did n't trust them much . All that running around smiting and killing in the name of the Lord . God 's wild bunch . He thought it made them fickle and vain . One click above ghosts . Satan did n't help the image much either .
DAGGETT: Satan ?
BILL: Well , he did start as an angel .
DAGGETT: You mean with the Church ?
BILL: You almost did it once . I never saw a seminary student more called to the collar than you . Why did n't you ever become ordained ?
DAGGETT: It 's a long story .
BILL: You 'll have to tell it to me sometime .
DAGGETT: Sometime .
GUARD: Need a pass , friend .
GABRIEL: I 'll just be a second .
GUARD: C'mon
GABRIEL: Sorry .
KATHERINE: Brian , have you seen Mary ?
BRIAN: I think she 's out back somewhere .
KATHERINE: Allison ?
ALLISON: We have n't seen her since lunch .
KATHERINE: We 're you guys up in the
MARY: But Simon and I were
KATHERINE: Come here . Mary reluctantly walks over to Katherine .
MARY: But
KATHERINE: Go .
SIMON: She was n't doing any harm .
KATHERINE: It 's not her I 'm worried about .
SIMON: Of course .
KATHERINE: What are you doing here ?
SIMON: Small job . Mostly done now . Just passing through .
KATHERINE: This is school property , you ca n't sleep here .
SIMON: It was n't part of the plan . Honest .
KATHERINE: Are you all right ?
SIMON: No . Not really .
KATHERINE: I 'll have to call the police .
SIMON: I wish you would n't , but I understand .
KATHERINE: They 'll help you .
SIMON: Oh , I rather doubt that .
MARY: Hi .
SIMON: Hello . I thought you 'd left .
MARY: I hid . I 'm very clever .
SIMON: I 'm sure you are . You were nice to give me the food .
MARY: I know .
SIMON: I have n't much time , Mary . And since you 've been so nice to me , there 's something I 'd very much like to give to you .
MARY: What ?
SIMON: Just for a little while . Something very special . Can you keep it a secret ? The biggest secret ever ?
MARY: Yes . What is it ?
SIMON: Come here , Mary . She takes a couple of shy steps toward him .
MARY: I do n't feel good
KATHERINE: What 's the matter , pumpkin ? Did you eat something ? Did he give you something ? Mary coughs up the last of her lunch .
MARY: Can I go home now ?
KATHERINE: Sure , hon . Let 's go .
VOICE: Most of my boys are up the highway on a tanker spill at the moment . They may be a while . These people are rarely any problem . I 'll have a deputy come by tonight or tomorrow and shoo him out .
KATHERINE: He looked hurt .
VOICE: They all do , ma'am . Inside or out , they 're all damaged goods .
DAGGETT: Yeah .
VOICE: It 's your friendly coroner .
DAGGETT: Why is my friendly coroner , after a long day at work , calling me at home ?
VOICE: I have something you 'll want to see .
DAGGETT: I doubt it .
VOICE: No , you 'll definitely want to see this .
CORONER: They also took the autopsy file .
DAGGETT: `` They '' ?
CORONER: He , she , it . They took it . They also lifted all the physical evidence from the San Julian impound .
DAGGETT: Where was everyone ?
CORONER: The cop at the desk is in the hospital as we speak with a broken collarbone . Everyone else was down the hall watching the basketball playoffs .
DAGGETT: Who won ?
CORONER: Temple .
DAGGETT: Lucky .
CORONER: Yeah . Foul on the buzzer .
DAGGETT: Looks like the snow angels we used to make as kids . Lie down in a clean ank . Move your arms up and down
CORONER: You know what this means . Our friend 's cleaned out all the evidence on this guy . Everything .
DAGGETT: Did the cop get a look at who nailed him ?
CORONER: Tall . Smiled a lot .
DAGGETT: Anything else ?
CORONER: He wore sunglasses . Thomas pulls out out his notebook .
DAGGETT: I 'm going to try .
CORONER: When you do , give me a call . Tell me I 'm not crazy .
GABRIEL: You like the desert , Jerry ?
JERRY: You promised . You promised that
GABRIEL: Soon . Honest . Do n't be a pest about it .
JERRY: Never trust a fucking angel .
GABRIEL: Excellent advice .
LT. PAUL: Do you ever have one of those afternoons where you feel no one 's giving you a straight answer about anything ?
DAGGETT: Oh , maybe five or six times a week .
LT. PAUL: It says here somebody got into the property warehouse and cleaned everything out of your evidence box . No , he did leave one thing . A footprint . 11-D .
DAGGETT: Mud on his shoes ?
LT. PAUL: Spinal fluid . Thomas slowly closes his notebook .
DAGGETT: Not yet . The Lt. rubs his eyes tiredly .
LT. PAUL: For your health ?
DAGGETT: So I can give you a straight answer .
LT. PAUL: Sure , why not ? Take the kids . See the Grand Canyon . Send me a fucking postcard .
DAGGETT: Sorry .
LT. PAUL: I 've got a headache , Tom , and I hate my life . If you have to go , go .
JERRY: Why do you need me ? I can hardly walk now .
GABRIEL: Some things are human work , son . Live or dead , human work . Besides , I like you .
JERRY: Lucky moi .
GABRIEL: I can always smell a graveyard .
JERRY: I hope you 're enjoying this .
GABRIEL: I always enjoy watching you work , Jerry .
JERRY: How did I ever get you in my life ?
GABRIEL: Come on , you did n't really want to kill yourself .
JERRY: But I did it , did n't I ? I did kill myself .
GABRIEL: Well , yes . Technically .
JERRY: And you 're just keeping me alive .
GABRIEL: Letting you die slower .
JERRY: I 'm so in your debt .
GABRIEL: Thank you , Jerry . I 'm touched . Really .
JERRY: Not much to look at .
GABRIEL: Ah , but it 's not what 's on the outside that matters
JERRY: Oooh , bad news for the war effort .
GABRIEL: Shut up ! !
JERRY: The hell away from you .
FEMALE VOICE: Hey little brother .
DAGGETT: Hey . How 's the world ?
VOICE: The world 's the usual . Except for a guppy . the world 's minus one guppy this morning .
DAGGETT: And Jamie and Mac ?
VOICE: They keep asking for Uncle Tommy . The only man that can make stuffed ears talk .
DAGGETT: My one true calling . What 's up ?
VOICE: What do you mean ?
DAGGETT: It 's five-thirty in the morning .
VOICE: I just thought I should call .
DAGGETT: You always were telepathic .

DAGGETT: I 'll be okay .
VOICE: Sorry about the dawn-attack call . I love you .
DAGGETT: I love you too , Jan .
GABRIEL: Boy , what a dump , huh ?
JERRY: Life 's a bitch .
GABRIEL: Well well
SIMON: Gabriel .
JERRY: Do n't mind me . Just along for the ide . Gabriel sits down against the wall .
GABRIEL: So , what shall we talk about ? Theology ?
SIMON: I 'm a little talked out on theology .
GABRIEL: Fair enough
SIMON: Oh yes .
GABRIEL: Do n't happen to have it on you by chance ?
SIMON: No .
GABRIEL: That would have been too easy .
SIMON: I do have one question .
GABRIEL: Shoot .
SIMON: Do you even remember what this war 's about ?
GABRIEL: That 's hardly the point , is it ?
SIMON: I guess I never did get the point .
GABRIEL: Happens .
SIMON: How do you do it , Gabriel ? How do you go on and on in this place ?
GABRIEL: I like it here , Simon . I always have .
SIMON: I 'm so tired Gabriel grasps Simon 's hand .
GABRIEL: Then join us , Simon . Reject the Nicene Council . We were here first .
SIMON: I ca n't do it , Gabriel . I do n't even know why anymore , but I ca n't .
GABRIEL: You know the routine .
SIMON: Yes .
GABRIEL: Not yet .
GABRIEL: This is getting boring , Simon .
JERRY: Amen .
GABRIEL: Where is it ? Where did you put it ?
DEPUTY: You may want to skip this , ma'am .
CROUCHED DEPUTY: God damn
DEPUTY: Were any of your students up here ?
KATHERINE: Mary
KATHERINE: How is she ?
GRANDMOTHER: Same .
KATHERINE: Did the doctor come by ?
GRANDMOTHER: He found nothing . But something is in her . I know . Something the Belagaana doctor ca n't see . The night people have been around two days now . It is a warning . So we have called the hand trembler . To find if she must have an Enemy Ghost Way .
SHERIFF: And to what do I owe the thrill of a visit from a So Cal homicide cop ?
DAGGETT: Run of of the mill psycho kille ody dismemberment on our end . The usual .
SHERIFF: Lovely place , Los Angeles .
DAGGETT: Got a lead I wanted to run down Chimney Rock way . Thought I 'd do the courtesy of telling you first .
SHERIFF: Big of you .
DAGGETT: You 're welcome to put a babysitte on me if you like . The Sheriff smiles .
SHERIFF: Son , this is the third biggest county in the country , not even counting the 25,000 square mile Indian eservation right next door , and I 've got fewer men than just one of your little palm tree precincts to cover all of it . 'Fraid the only help you 're gon na get from me , short of another shoot out at the OK Corral , is that cup of coffee in your hand . A middle-aged secretary enters with a stack of paper .
SECRETARY: Here 's the last week 's watch reports .
SHERIFF: Sent a car up there this morning . Teacher complained some vagrant was sleeping in her schoolhouse .
DAGGETT: May I ?
SHERIFF: Small piece of advice , Lt. Dagget , that I give free of charge to all visiting big city policemen It 's wild country up there . Always has een , always will be . You come across anything that snarls , you call me first , hear ?
DAGGETT: I never turn down advice , Sheriff . Especially when it 's free .
GRAVE KEEPER: Which time ?
DAGGETT: What do you mean ?
GRAVE KEEPER: Somebody dug him up last night . I just finished putting him back .
DAGGETT: Did they take anything ?
GRAVE KEEPER: Nothin ' on the outside .
DAGGETT: Hello .
KATHERINE: Can I help you with something ?
DAGGETT: Tom Dagget . I 'm with the police .
KATHERINE: About the guy upstairs ?
DAGGETT: I 'd like to ask you a few questions .
KATHERINE: I 've kinda got my hands full right now .
DAGGETT: I 'll just tag along .
KATHERINE: Here , make yourself useful .
DAGGETT: What grade is this ?
KATHERINE: All of 'em .
DAGGETT: Town does n't look that small .
KATHERINE: Nearly all ghosts now . When the coppe mine closed it took most of the town with it . We just teach out of this one corner of the schoolhouse now . Rest of it 's been abandoned for years .
DAGGETT: You 're the only teacher .
KATHERINE: Yup . Just me . Randy
RANDY: But he
KATHERINE: Do it again and I 'll put your head in the door and slam it . Love and understanding are important tools in education .
DAGGETT: Clearly . The children skitter back and forth playing .
KATHERINE: I wanted to know what the hell he was doing there .
DAGGETT: What did he say ?
KATHERINE: That it was n't part of the plan . He looked hurt . Bloody . Like someone had cut him . That happens here . Was that stuff on the floo eally him ?
DAGGETT: Did any of the children talk to him ?
KATHERINE: Yes .
DAGGETT: Who ?
KATHERINE: She 's home sick from school today .
DAGGETT: Can I speak with her parents ?
KATHERINE: They 're dead . She lives with he grandmother . I 'll have to ask her .
DAGGETT: All right . This is my number at the hotel . Thomas starts away . Pauses .
KATHERINE: The General ? Saw him here and there . It 's a small town .
DAGGETT: Military man ?
KATHERINE: About a million years ago . His interests lately were more like gardening and herbal tea .
DAGGETT: Did you go to the funeral ?
KATHERINE: Everyone did . He lived here .
DAGGETT: No dark hidden secrets ?
KATHERINE: There are no secrets in small towns , Mr. Dagget , dark or otherwise .
GABRIEL'S VOICE: It 's unusual to see someone of you age in church on a weekday .
GABRIEL: Do n't get me wrong . I think it 's an excellent sign of character .
DAGGETT: Either are you .
GABRIEL: I 'm looking for something .
DAGGETT: Have you found it ?
GABRIEL: I will . Have you found what you 're looking for ?
DAGGETT: I will .
GABRIEL: I do n't doubt it . You 'll let me know ? When you find it ?
DAGGETT: Where are you staying ?
GABRIEL: I 'm around .
DAGGETT: I got your note .
KATHERINE: Have a seat . You need a card . Here , play one of mine .
DAGGETT: No , it 's okay . Really
JOHN: You must learn to shed your high- strung ways , pale face . You must learn the spirit joy in patience , peace , and making fifty or sixty ucks .
KATHERINE: John , this is Mr. Dagget . Says he 's with the police , though judging by his coat and basic command of the english language , I do n't think it 's from anywhere around here .
DAGGETT: Tom . From Los Angeles .
JOHN: That near Oxnard ?
DAGGETT: Sort of .
KATHERINE: Long way from home , Tom-from-Los- Angeles .
MICROPHONE VOICE: D-9 D-9
DAGGETT: Hey , wait . I won . I won !
KATHERINE: What ? No way
JOHN: Recount ! Recount !
KATHERINE: Your turn .
DAGGETT: Oh , no thanks .
KATHERINE: C'mon , do n't be a drip . She leads him out onto the floor .
DAGGETT: I 'm not very good at this
KATHERINE: No , you 're not , are you ? She smiles . Gets a smile out of him .
JOHN: So how 's our star pupil feeling today ?
KATHERINE: Mary ? The school doctor came by . Declared it `` Non-specific gastrointestinal disorder '' .
JOHN: Latin for `` I do n't have the slightest fucking idea '' .
DAGGETT: Will she be able to talk with me ?
KATHERINE: That 's up to her . Mary 's grandmother called a hand trembler .
JOHN: Uh oh . Hocus pocus time .
DAGGETT: Is that serious ?
JOHN: Depends what the hand trembler says . People call them in when they think a witch or a Yei is trying to sprinkle corpse sickness in their hogan , o if the Night People have been hanging around too much . Night people screw around a lot , but they 're good at warning of evil ghosts .
DAGGETT: Who are the Night People ?
JOHN: They come as coyotes .
DAGGETT: Beautiful stars out here .
JOHN: Too much fucking sky in the desert . It pushes on you . Sometimes I wonder if anyone in heaven even knows this place is here
KATHERINE: Where do you keep the coffee in this joint ?
JOHN: Above the stove .
DAGGETT: What happens if the hand tremble says a ghost has been
JOHN: Messing with Mary ? If you 're smart you say thank you very much and forget about it . But if you 're heavy traditional , and Mary 's people are serious traditional , you have an Enemy Ghost Way .
DAGGETT: What 's that ?
JOHN: Goddamn expensive . It 's a Sing to purify and drive off the corpse sickness . Two days of dancing and ceremony and feeding the whole damn village . Not even to mention hiring the yataallii , if you can even find one these days . And you can bet they do n't come cheap . But every clan does it a bit different . Especially Mary 's .
DAGGETT: You know them ?
JOHN: The Bitter Sky Clan . Hard core eservation . No lights , no running water , no HBO . Their village is out on the edge of Old Woman Butte . Million miles from anything . Witch country . Settled right there in the Dead People Land where no one else would , right on top of the old Anasazi village . They 're a dying clan . Just the old ones now . All alone out there in the middle of nothing . They can keep it .
DAGGETT: Do people really still believe in it all ? Ghosts , Sings , corpse sickness ?
JOHN: Depends , I guess . Sometimes you go along because it 's a village thing , or you do n't want to disappoint grandma . But sometimes , when you 're alone out there , far from town , and the wind kicks up and sneaks into your hogan I do n't know .
DAGGETT: I think John 's out for the evening .
KATHERINE: Saturday night in Chimney Rock . She hands him a mug of coffee .
DAGGETT: So how does a person like you end up teaching here ?
KATHERINE: When I was younger I used to believe that no matter how much you mucked around in your life , one day , if you listened hard enough , a voice would tell you what you were really cut out to do . And when it did n't show up on schedule I decided to go look for it . And I looked in a lot of places , believe me . I drove that oad out there so far that the end ecame the beginning again . And it was when I got here that I realized there never was going to be a voice . So I stopped looking and took the first job they offered me . That make any sense to you ?
DAGGETT: Oh , I know all about voices . Problem is not all of them are very nice .
KATHERINE: How did you end up a cop ?
DAGGETT: It was the evil of two lessers .
KATHERINE: Are you always this cryptic ?
DAGGETT: No . When you get to know me I can be down right evasive .
KATHERINE: First trailer on the highway past town . Thomas climbs out .
DAGGETT: That 's what my bosses keep saying .
KATHERINE: I meant it as a compliment .
DAGGETT: So taken . Goodnight , Miss Henley .
KATHERINE: Goodnight , Tom-from-Los-Angeles .
GABRIEL: Get any sleep ? Just kidding .
SANDRA: Sandra .
GABRIEL: And did you see the man upstairs , Sandra ?
SANDRA: A little .
GABRIEL: Did you talk to him ?
SANDRA: No .
GABRIEL: And who did , Sandra . Who talked to the man ?
SANDRA: Mary .
GABRIEL: And where is Mary , Sandra ?
SANDRA: She is n't here . She 's sick .
GABRIEL: You 've got very pretty teeth , Sandra . Here , let me see
KATHERINE: What the hell do you think you 're doing ? Gabriel looks up , unperturbed , and smiles .
GABRIEL: Just talking to the kids , Ma'am .
KATHERINE: Get off his knee , Sandra . Everyone else , go inside . Now . The kids reluctantly shuffle off .
BRIAN: 'Bye , Gabriel .
GABRIEL: See ya , kids . Be sure to study you math .
KATHERINE: Who are you ?
GABRIEL: It 's a long story .
JERRY: Everyone else does .
KATHERINE: I do n't know what the hell is going on , but you both better get out of here . Right now .
GABRIEL: You 're right
KATHERINE: Al ! Keep an eye on the children fo me . I 'll be right back . And call the sheriff .
JANITOR: Sheriff ? What the hell do I tell him ?
KATHERINE: Just call .
DAGGETT: You 're a little early yourself .
KATHERINE: I wanted to check on her .
DAGGETT: That makes two of us .
KATHERINE: How are you feeling , pumpkin ?
MARY: Better .
KATHERINE: This is Mr. Dagget , Mary . He 'd like to ask you some questions . You do n't have to answer if you do n't want to .
MARY: It 's okay .
DAGGETT: Mary , when you talked to man up in the building
MARY: Simon .
DAGGETT: Yes , Simon . What did Simon say ?
MARY: That 's funny . `` Simon says '' .
DAGGETT: Right . Like the game .
MARY: I 'm good at it . I 'm very clever .
DAGGETT: We 'll have to play together sometime .
MARY: Simon even said so . He also asked if I could keep a secret .
DAGGETT: And what was that ?
MARY: Something he gave me .
KATHERINE: What , pumpkin ?
MARY: Then it would n't be a secret .
DAGGETT: You 're a good friend not to tell , Mary . But I 'm a friend of Simon 's too . So if you ever want to tell , you can to me . Okay ?
MARY: It 's a secret Mary lowers her head and shuts her eyes .
DAGGETT: No Mary , I have n't .
MARY: They do n't bleed . Not the way you and I do . Or maybe it was just the cold
KATHERINE: It 's okay It 's okay
GRANDMOTHER: It 's all right , Miss Henley . We know you love Mary
KATHERINE: What are we going to do ?
GRANDMOTHER: She 's going to have the Enemy Ghost Way . We leave this afternoon .
DAGGETT: Where will they do the ceremony ?
KATHERINE: In the home village . The Hand Tremble must have found corpse sickness
DAGGETT: They 're taking her away ? Should n't she see a doctor ?
KATHERINE: She 's already seen a doctor . That son of a bitch
DAGGETT: Who ?
KATHERINE: Gabriel the children called him . The little shit was hanging around my kids this morning asking about Mary . He and his buddy make a real pair .
DAGGETT: Maybe it 's time I checked out Mr. Gabriel .
KATHERINE: I know where he parks his car .
DAGGETT: Chosin Reservoir was a Korean wa attle the Marines had against the Chinese , supposedly the bloodiest hand-to-hand fighting of the century . Someone been teaching that to you class ?
KATHERINE: Sure , right next to Jack ' N Jill .
DAGGETT: Where would she have heard it ?
KATHERINE: Nobody I can think of . Maybe one .
DAGGETT: Who ?
KATHERINE: General Hawthorne .
DAGGETT: Did she know him ?
KATHERINE: He did n't like children .
DAGGETT: You could n't and tell a story like that to one .
KATHERINE: It was there earlier .
DAGGETT: If I was smart I 'd call the Sheriff or somebody in town who knows this place . Then again , there is one thing worse than getting killed .
KATHERINE: What ?
DAGGETT: Looking like an idiot if it 's nothing . He pops his trunk and takes out a flashlight .
KATHERINE: I 'll come along .
DAGGETT: No , if someone has to fall a hundred feet down a black pit , he should at least be on official duty .
KATHERINE: It 's cold
DAGGETT: Shit .
KATHERINE: Yeah Sorry .
DAGGETT: Well , I 've seen enough .
KATHERINE: What is that ?
DAGGETT: I do n't know . Maybe a bum o something .
KATHERINE: Do you feel it ?
DAGGETT: Yes .
KATHERINE: What is it ?
DAGGETT: Oh no Oh God no
KATHERINE: What What was that ? Hell ?
DAGGETT: No . The voices . They were screaming and fighting over theology . They do n't sweat much about that in hell . But they do in heaven . He squeezes a handful of dirt in his hands .
KATHERINE: How can that be heaven ? Jesus Christ . How ? I do n't even believe in heaven .
DAGGETT: That extra chapter by St. John was ight . It 's a war Just like the first one . Just like when the angel Michael beat Lucifer and cast him out . Only now they 've turned on each other Turned on each other in a civil war over theology .
KATHERINE: How do you know know so much about that ?
DAGGETT: I just know . Yes folks , the good news is that there 's life after death in heaven . The bad news is that it 's as screwed up as here .
KATHERINE: They were like us .
DAGGETT: They are us . Aborted children . And they need us . They need our corrupt , dark souls for their fight . They need
KATHERINE: Mary .
DAGGETT: What are you doing ?
KATHERINE: I do n't know what this is . I do n't know what I believe . I do n't know if my sanity is lying back in that cave flopping around waiting for me . But I know one thing . Those Those things are n't taking her !
DAGGETT: No .
KATHERINE: Me either .
DAGGETT: Get away from her .
GABRIEL: You know . Son of a bitch , the priest wanna-be actually figured it out . That 's a rare club , son . At least down here .
DAGGETT: Back away from the kid , man . Now .
GABRIEL: She wo n't feel anything , honest . I 'll have to tear her apart of course just the way it goes but it 'll be all right in the end . A good catholic oy like you , Mr. Daggett , you should e on my side .
DAGGETT: Goddamn it
GABRIEL: You 're gon na have to watch that profanity .
JERRY: Thanks man , I appreciate it . You 're a sport .
GABRIEL: You little pest , do you have any idea how hard it is to get one of those ?
KATHERINE: You son of a bitch , why ? Why do this ?
GABRIEL: Because I 'm an angel , you miserable wretch ! I kill first borns while their mothers watch ! I turn whole cities into salt ! I even , when I feel like it , rip the souls from little girls ! And from now until eternity , the only thing you 'll be able to count on in your pathetic little existence is never knowing why ! I 'm wasting my time here . C'mon petunia , let 's get on with it
DAGGETT: Go . Go !
KATHERINE: You
DAGGETT: Where
KATHERINE: She was coming up the street .
MARY: Is Gabriel dead ? Mary 's knelt down beside Thomas .
DEPUTY: What the hell happened here ?
DAGGETT: LAPD .
DEPUTY: That 's a start . How about the rest of it ?
DAGGETT: That man over there . He 's wanted . Murder . I 'm taking him in . Shit
DEPUTY: I think you 're going to the hospital first .
DAGGETT: No , I have to Again , the pain . The second deputy has walked over to Gabriel .
DEPUTY: Is he alive ?
DEPUTY #2: He 's alive .
DEPUTY: Cuff him . We 'll take him to the hospital in our car .
DAGGETT: No , you do n't understand . You have to let me have him
FIREMAN: He 'll be all right . Just a bad hit .
DAGGETT: We have to get out of here .
KATHERINE: But your head
DAGGETT: If you want Mary to stay alive past sundown we have to leave , and we have to do it now .
KATHERINE: Mary 's village .
TELEPHONE VOICE: County Coroner 's office , Assistant Coroner Raphael speaking .
DAGGETT: Willie ?
VOICE: Tom ?
DAGGETT: You were n't crazy , man .
OLD MAN: I am Bartholomew Grey Horse , born to the Deer Spring Clan , born for the Slow Talking People . Today I am the yataalii for Mary Tsosie of the Bitte Sky Clan .
GREY HORSE: Ya-tah .
GRANDMOTHER: Ya-tah-hey .
MARY: This is a good place .
DAGGETT: Yes ?
MARY: Separate water source . Stocked grain . Only one possible approach . A man could , with the proper defenses , hold off an entire battalion fo weeks . Months .
DAGGETT: Which one of you is that talking , Mary ? Or do you even know anymore ?
GREY HORSE: We will start the Sing soon to remove the Yei spirit and stop the ghost sickness .
DAGGETT: This might not be the work of a Navaho ghost .
GREY HORSE: It 's all the same .
GRANDMOTHER: Now we sleep , Katherine . Tomorrow , after dark , we begin again .
VOICE: Hello , Katherine .
KATHERINE: Oh Lord , I ca n't do this . I ca n't do this anymore
FIGURE: We must talk , Katherine . It 's takes all her strength to look upon him .
KATHERINE: You 're You 're God ?
FIGURE: God is love , Katherine .
KATHERINE: I ca n't . I ca n't do this tonight . Go away .
FIGURE: I can kill you , Katherine . I can lay you out and fill your mouth with your mother 's feces . Or I can talk with you . Katherine stops . Faces him .
KATHERINE: Good job .
FIGURE: I rarely do this in person . I am , perhaps , somewhat out of touch .
KATHERINE: Are you one of them ?
FIGURE: No .
KATHERINE: You 're not an angel ?
FIGURE: Oh , I am an angel . A very special one . The first . The oldest . The naive eagle scout , he once loved me above all others , and I him . It was the only true love for either of us , but like all true love , it could n't possibly last .
KATHERINE: What do you care ?
FIGURE: I have my interests He turns back to her .
KATHERINE: And if there 's a heaven ?
FIGURE: I 'd be very unhappy . I am here to help you and the little itch not because I love you , not ecause I care about you , but because I want this war to go on and on and on .
KATHERINE: How ?
FIGURE: Listen when I speak . Now go to bed , Katherine . Tomorrow , I promise you , is a big day .
DAGGETT: Is it over ?
KATHERINE: For now . They start again tomorrow .
DAGGETT: And at the end of it ?
KATHERINE: The Enemy Way chant removes the invading yei ghost .
DAGGETT: Will it work on a general 's soul ?
KATHERINE: We 'll see . How 's the head ?
DAGGETT: Still attached . Barely . She sits down on the floor beside him .
KATHERINE: Here , I 'll change the bandage . She carefully unwraps the blood-soaked gauze .
DAGGETT: No .
KATHERINE: Then I must be doing it wrong .
DAGGETT: How nice . Which one ?
KATHERINE: The main one . Satan . Lucifer . The dark angel . You know .
DAGGETT: What did he have to say ?
KATHERINE: That he did it all for love . That and I have a choice . Mary 's life o a billion souls waiting in the pipeline for heavenland to open .
DAGGETT: You 're not kidding , are you ?
KATHERINE: No sir .
DAGGETT: Satan ? You 're sure ?
KATHERINE: You had to be there .
DAGGETT: Why was n't I !
KATHERINE: We can double date next time if it 's that important to you .
DAGGETT: You do n't understand , I 've spent my whole life I do n't suppose it would occur to anyone in authority to fill me in on what 's going on every once in awhile , huh ? Shit !
KATHERINE: It did n't seem important to him . Katherine finishes taping the new bandage .
DAGGETT: A near miss .
KATHERINE: Why ?
DAGGETT: It 's a long story .
KATHERINE: This may be your last chance to tell it . A wind outside rustles through the hogans .
DAGGETT: The other night , you were talking about waiting for a voice to call you to something . Well , let me tell you , the worst thing that can happen to you is to be called to something . Since I can remember a voice from somewhere deep in the Church called me . So loud and so often that by thirteen I knew I was going to be a priest . You know what that 's like ? My parents , friends , all of them thought I was crazy . But see , I had this voice . The voice that kept coaxing me along , telling me there was a reason . So I entered the seminary and was half way to my starched white collar when my mother , father , and my little brother were wiped out in a car crash .
KATHERINE: We 've never seen God , have we ? Not in any of this .
DAGGETT: Yeah , He 's certainly a shy son of a itch , I 'll give Him that .
KATHERINE: Maybe we 're not supposed to . Maybe that 's faith .
DAGGETT: Do you still have faith in anything , Katherine ?
KATHERINE: I have faith in Mary . And that I 'm going to save that little girl from those creeping things out there . From all of them .
DAGGETT: Maybe you were called to something after all .
KATHERINE: Maybe we both were .
GABRIEL: Heavy sleeper , John .
JOHN: Do n't Do n't hurt me , man . My wallet 's in the dresser .
GABRIEL: Do n't be such a materialist , John . No end to your bad habits .
JOHN: What do you want ?
GABRIEL: A moment of your time .
JOHN: You ought to have that nose looked at , man .
GABRIEL: Where are they , John ? Katherine and Mary ? Where would they go ?
JOHN: What ? Mary ? I do n't know .
GABRIEL: Sure you do . Think hard .
JOHN: No , really . I do n't know . The school maybe .
GABRIEL: Now you 're not even trying , John . You 're Katherine 's best friend . She tells you everything .
JOHN: I 'm just the driver , y'know ?
GABRIEL: I can help you remember , John
NURSE: Can I help you ?
GABRIEL: Someone 's going to die here soon . I 'll just be a minute .
NURSE: There 's no visitors allowed in ICU .
GABRIEL: The timing 's important . I can smell these things , you know .
WOMAN: No , no
GABRIEL: Hey , c'mon , do n't start Rachael . Here It 's only for a short time . Promise .
MARY: Hi , Miss Henley .
KATHERINE: Hi , pumpkin . Good morning .
KATHERINE: How 's the head ?
DAGGETT: Shitty . Coffee ?
KATHERINE: What are we going to do if he comes ?
DAGGETT: You mean when , right ?
KATHERINE: When he comes .
DAGGETT: There 's no phone here ? Radio ? Stupid question . If we were smart we 'd leave . Get to a town . A sheriff station .
KATHERINE: Mary 's ceremony is n't over yet . The Enemy Ghost Way . The alien spirit has n't been driven out .
DAGGETT: Do you really believe in the ceremony ?
KATHERINE: Would you have believed in any of this three days ago ?
DAGGETT: So we stay and dump the General 's soul .
KATHERINE: You have the gun ?
DAGGETT: With one shot left . The spares And a change of clothing , are all still at the hotel . We 're going to have to come up with something .
KATHERINE: We could always ask him .
LUCIFER: I always forget how cold it gets in the desert . The swimming , bottomless eyes fall on Thomas .
DAGGETT: Fuck you .
LUCIFER: Much better . Can I have some coffee ?
DAGGETT: Keep it . He finishes it . Cranes his neck .
LUCIFER: I have come to remind you that the winged party boys are just that spoiled boys . You are armed , howeve pathetically , with the one thing they never really understood theology . It 's not much , but that 's life .
DAGGETT: Is this supposed to be our `` win one for The Ripper '' speech ?
LUCIFER: Do n't press your luck , Mr. Daggett .
GABRIEL: Say , Ma'am , any idea where I can find Old Woman Butte ?
MADGE: It 's on the reservation .
GABRIEL: I do n't suppose you could be just a tad more specific . Madge .
MADGE: Is n't your friend hungry ?
GABRIEL: Not for a while , I 'm afraid . Funniest thing .
MADGE: Take 522 to the Sonsela Wash cut- off . First dirt road go left . Twenty , twenty-five miles you 'll see it . Big , black and all alone .
GABRIEL: I doubt we 'll meet again .
MADGE: Suits me .
DAGGETT: You could always lend a hand .
KATHERINE: He 's coming .
DAGGETT: Is there any way to speed this up ?
VILLAGER: No .
DAGGETT: Lock the door .
GABRIEL: You 'll like this , Rachael . Maybe not .
DAGGETT: I 'm not an angel , heaven or hell . I 'm a man you eyeless puke , which means I have one thing you neve will . A soul . And though I may , somewhere inside , believe in a God , I will never , never , believe in you .
GABRIEL: A little speechy today , are n't we ? Okay pal , have it your way .
DAGGETT: You your war
GABRIEL: C'mon , son , out with it . Make this one count .
DAGGETT: Your war 's a lie !
GABRIEL: What ?
DAGGETT: Running around acting like this is eally about whether Christ is just the son of God or if he is God . Bullshit ! That 's not what this is about at all , is it ?
GABRIEL: You 're wrong .
DAGGETT: Then prove it to me , Gabriel . I studied three fucking years of theology before I picked up a gun . C'mon , you 're chief goddamn angel , I 'm just a little man . Prove to me Christ is just a son and less than God . Prove it ! Gabriel hesitates .
GABRIEL: I do n't have to .
DAGGETT: Because you ca n't ! Because this wa is n't about some obscure medieval hangup . You 're just jealous .
GABRIEL: You 're wrong !
DAGGETT: Try me , Gabriel . Go on . Prove to me the temporal nature of the Trinity . Show me through logic how the Son of the Word can be separated from the Father . Fight me with philosophy , Gabriel !
GABRIEL: No !
DAGGETT: Because you and your army are wrong ! And you know it . You knew it sixteen centuries ago .
GABRIEL: We do n't have to listen to him ! He 's just a son !
DAGGETT: That 's it . You 're jealous . Jealous He could love something more than you
GABRIEL: Shut up Gabriel 's becoming unglued .
DAGGETT: If you wanted to know so badly , Gabriel , why did n't you just ask Him ? Why did n't you just ask God ?
GABRIEL: Because He does n't talk to us anymore !
GABRIEL: Relax folks , it 's just a soul .
KATHERINE: Go to hell .
GABRIEL: Heaven , darling . Heaven . At least get the zip code right .
KATHERINE: It 's all the same , is n't it ?
GABRIEL: No . In heaven we believe in love .
KATHERINE: And what do you love , Gabriel ?
GABRIEL: Cracking your skull . He advances on her .
KATHERINE: That 's all it is for you anymore , Gabriel , is n't it ? Just the killing and the burning . You do n't work fo God anymore . You do n't fight fo love .
GABRIEL: Shut up !
KATHERINE: Finish it . He , everyone , just stare . Stunned to stone .
LUCIFER: No .
GABRIEL: Oh man , this just is n't my day .
LUCIFER: Long time .
GABRIEL: The world 's young , man .
LUCIFER: And full of ambition .
GABRIEL: This is n't your war .
LUCIFER: But I remember the last one . Michael 's war .
GABRIEL: You lost .
LUCIFER: But lots of angels were with me . every one followed their leader out of heaven .
GABRIEL: Yeah yeah , I was there , remember ?
LUCIFER: Except one . Oh , he was with me all ight . He hated the Eagle Scout . Envied the power He gave to His Son . But this angel never came out front during the war . And when it ended he thought maybe , maybe the Eagle Scout did n't notice . So he laid low and towed the company line till he could start his own war . It was all just jealousy .
GABRIEL: You 're dreaming .
LUCIFER: But maybe He did notice . Maybe that 's why I 'm here .
GABRIEL: Stay away from me .
LUCIFER: You 've always been a part of me , Gabriel . And now it 's time to come home .
GABRIEL: Fuck you !
GREY HORSE: The enemy spirit is gone .
DAGGETT: Where ?
KATHERINE: And they wo n't find it . Not in Mary .
VILLAGER: We have some bandages .
KATHERINE: Are you all right , pumpkin ?
MARY: I 'm okay .
KATHERINE: It 's going to be okay We 're all going to be okay
LUCIFER: I understand .
KATHERINE: Then this is done .
LUCIFER: Not necessarily . Maybe I like you . Maybe I want you to come with me .
KATHERINE: No .
LUCIFER: You will . You will because any othe way is going to be more awful than you can imagine .
KATHERINE: Are you threatening me ? Just a grinning , twisted stare .
LUCIFER: Perhaps another time .
KATHERINE: I 'm holding my breath .
LUCIFER: Goodbye , Katherine . For now .
MARY: Is he coming back ?
KATHERINE: I do n't think so , honey I do n't think so
SHERIFF: Is he going to live ?
DEPUTY: With any luck .
SHERIFF: I thought I told you to give me a call if anything snarled .
DAGGETT: There was n't a phone .
SHERIFF: Hmmm .
DAGGETT: Yeah .
SHERIFF: Gabriel what ?
DAGGETT: Just Gabriel .
SHERIFF: Pretty violent guy , Gabriel . Even for out here .
DAGGETT: Yeah .
SHERIFF: Caught up with him at the village ?
DAGGETT: He caught up with me .
SHERIFF: What were you doing way up here ?
DAGGETT: Enemy Ghost Way for Mary Tsosie .
SHERIFF: Indian stuff .
DAGGETT: Yeah . Indian stuff .
SHERIFF: Did you kill this Gabriel ?
DAGGETT: Maybe . I think so .
SHERIFF: Do n't have any idea where the body is I suppose .
DAGGETT: No .
SHERIFF: Well , if he 's alive he wo n't get fa out there . Us or the coyotes , it 'll e the same . I rang your office in LA . They do n't have a warrant out for a Gabriel . O anybody else in Arizona .
DAGGETT: I had n't gotten around to it .
SHERIFF: Sort of an out of pocket thing .
DAGGETT: Yes .
SHERIFF: That woman lying at the bottom of the arroyo , the one still in he hospital gown , know anything about that ?
DAGGETT: No .
SHERIFF: Really .
DAGGETT: Really .
SHERIFF: This Gabriel was sure one busy dude .
DAGGETT: Yes , he was . Beat .
SHERIFF: You 'll be going back to Los Angeles now ?
DAGGETT: Yeah .
SHERIFF: Do n't hurry back . The deputy finishes his bandaging .
DEPUTY: Do n't do much but breathe the next few days . And get to a hospital . You 're going to need some serious stitches .
DAGGETT: Thanks .
DEPUTY: Say hi to Hollywood for me .
MARY: You look bad .
DAGGETT: Thank you . I feel worse . They lean on you much ?
KATHERINE: Not really . I think they might have even understood . One of them 's related to this clan . He 'll give us a ride ack if we want .
DAGGETT: Good . I think I 've about run out of hospitality with the sheriff 's department . The moment drifts into silence .
KATHERINE: Do you think it 's really over ?
DAGGETT: Till we die . Her eyes settle on his .
KATHERINE: When I die , I want you with me .
DAGGETT: I want that too .
RICHARD: Where are my clothes ?
SIMONE: In the kitchen . I think . Can I make you some coffee ?
RICHARD: Sorry , I got ta go . I 'm late .
SIMONE: In here .
RICHARD: Baby , I just ca n't do this anymore .
SIMONE: Fine . Whatever . Just go .
RICHARD: Let 's not end it like that . It 's been an amazing three and a half weeks . Thank you . And you should know that you have the nicest ass I 've ever been with .
TOUCHED: You mean it ?
RICHARD: I do . It 's magnificent .
SIMONE: I work really hard on it .
RICHARD: I know you do .
MARGARET: I knew you would call ! Now come on , tell me what I want to hear . Give it to me .
DOORMAN: You have to put it by your mouth so people can hear you .
MARGARET: You should get paid extra for being so darn funny .
JILLIAN: You 're running late today .
RICHARD: Jillian , you are the best .
JILLIAN: If you think I 'm good at this , you should use that coffee cup sometime .
RICHARD: See ya tomorrow .
MARGARET: You 've been thinking about our talk because I 'm right . Everyone does publicity . Roth , McCourt , Russo . Hell , Chabon practically whores himself . Know what they have in common ? A Pulitzer . Yes , I know you have n't done it in twenty years , but that 's how long it 's been since you 've written a book this good .
RECEPTIONIST: Good morning !
RICHARD: You 've got a conference call in thirty , a staff meeting at nine , and your immigration lawyer sent some papers for you to sign .
MARGARET: Cancel the call , move the meeting to eight ,
RICHARD: Nice job .
MARGARET: When I want your praise , I 'll ask for it . Is Bob here ?
RICHARD: I 'm sure . You want him on the phone ?
MARGARET: We 're going to his office . Grab your pad . Richard calmly backs out of the office
RICHARD: What ?
MARGARET: Are you bored here ? Do you need little distractions like that to get you through the day ?
RICHARD: Uh
MARGARET: You have another late night out ?
MARGARET: I 'm firing on all cylinders and you 've got hearts on your coffee cup , wicked bed head , and a wrinkled suit that you wore yesterday .
RICHARD: Oh . Well , it wo n't be wrinkled for long .
MARGARET: You 'll magically unwrinkle ?
RICHARD: Yes .
MARGARET: You have magic pants ?
RICHARD: No . I 've sprayed them with stuff that will take care of the wrinkles .
MARGARET: Does this work on more than just your pants ?
RICHARD: Anything that 's wrinkled .
MARGARET: Buy me some .
RICHARD: Will do .
MARGARET: I do n't care what or who you do on your own time , but when you walk through that doo you represent me , and I will not have you personal life affect you at work . If you want me to think of promoting you to editor , I need you sharp , focused and professional . Got it ?
RICHARD: Got it .
MARGARET: Great . Now you 're just a prop in here , so do n't say a word .
BOB: Ah . Our fearless leader and her liege . Margaret smiles .
MARGARET: I 'm lettin ' you go , Bob .
BOB: Pardon ?
MARGARET: You 're fired .
BOB: What ? What are you talking about ?
MARGARET: This is n't working out .
BOB: You ca n't
MARGARET: I asked you repeatedly to get Frank to do publicity . You said it was impossible .
BOB: It is . He does n't do publicity .
MARGARET: I just talked to him . He 's in .
BOB: But
MARGARET: No more buts , Bob . I 've been chief for a month and a half , and this is the third time you 've dropped the ball . You did n't even call to ask him .
MARGARET: All you had to do to was pick up the phone . That 's it . Now I 'll give you two months to find a new job , and then you can say you esigned . I wo n't tell a soul , my lips are sealed .
RICHARD: He 's up and about to pop .
MARGARET: Oh Bob , do n't do it
MARGARET: What are you doing ? I gave you a civilized way out of this .
BOB: This is because I 'm your competition . Because I threaten you !
MARGARET: Oh , Bob . You could never threaten me . I 'm firing you because you 're lazy , entitled and incompetent . I 'm firing you because you do n't work hard . So if you know what 's good for you , you 'll shut up , take off that idiculous bow tie , find a bar and get drunk . Because if you say one more word , Richard here is going to call security and have you thrown out on your ass . Are we perfectly clear ? Bob nods . MARGARET Good . Now I 've got work to do , so if you 'll
RICHARD: No problem . I 'll just cancel my trip this weekend .
MARGARET: I gave you the weekend off ?
RICHARD: It was my Grandma 's ninetieth birthday . But no big deal . You were right before , I need to stay focused . Professional .
MARGARET: She tell you to quit ?
RICHARD: No . No . Um . Yes ? But as I 've explained to them , after three years together , you 're the only person on the planet who can make me editor , so that 's the way it is . Richard 's phone rings and he picks it up .
MARGARET: Who is this guy ?
RICHARD: He said you knew each other . You were n't sure so you told me to set a meeting . We escheduled on him four times .
MARGARET: Go get him . But he 's out of here in five minutes , we 've got work to do . Margaret leaves and goes into her office .
RICHARD: I 'll charge up the cattle prod .
MARGARET: Yeah . Well , those announcements are silly , are n't they ? Like everyone who needs to know does n't know already .
MR. GILBERTSON: Three years ago ? We worked together .
MARGARET: Do n't have it
MR. GILBERTSON: Remember `` Dandelion 's Desire ? '' Margaret gets excited .
MARGARET: Oh my God , you read that manuscript with me ? That book is legend . Without a doubt the worst ever written .
MR. GILBERTSON: You think ?
MR. GILBERTSON: I believe there was a glossary Margaret laughs , caught up in the memory .
MARGARET: Did you see the pass letter I wrote him ?
QUOTING: `` Your grammar is impeccable , but please do not confuse superior form with writing ability . Save your skills for the office newsletter , you sir , are no writer . '' A beat . Margaret says matter of fact
MARGARET: You wrote the book .
MR. GILBERTSON: I did .
MARGARET: You 're Dante Dickens ?
MR. GILBERTSON: One of my nom de plumes .
MARGARET: I 'm sorry if I hurt your feelings . You obviously were spending a lot of time writing , I just thought you should channel all that passion into something else .
MR. GILBERTSON: Ms. Mills , I 'm with U.S . Citizenship and Immigration Services , and I 'm deporting you to Canada .
MR. GILBERTSON: You need citizenship now ? After the big promotion ?
MARGARET: Yes . And all the papers are in .
MR. GILBERTSON: Well , my office is going to reject you paperwork on Monday , while we investigate whether your behavior is well disposed to the good order and happiness of the United States . We must protect our sovereignty .
MARGARET: I 'm a threat to the sovereignty of the United States ?
MR. GILBERTSON: Yes , and unfortunately my investigation will take awhile , so you 'll be deported while your case winds through the system . Will it affect you at work if you are n't allowed to enter the U.S. for the next two to three years ?
MARGARET: `` Affect me at work ? '' I 'll lose my job !
MR. GILBERTSON: Ahhhh . That 's a shame . Too bad we ca n't work something out .
MARGARET: Oh , no . No , no , no . I wo n't do it .
MR. GILBERTSON: Do what , Ms. Mills ?
MR. GILBERTSON: I 've edited it down . It 's better .
MARGARET: Well then , get it published at anothe house .
MR. GILBERTSON: They all just do n't get me .
MARGARET: All ?
MR. GILBERTSON: Well not all . Two hundred fifty , two hundred sixty-one . Ish .
MARGARET: I 'll be fired and laughed out of the industry if I publish that book .
MR. GILBERTSON: I 'm at the end of my rope , Ms. Mills . I 'm an author . Not some bureaucrat who brings a lunchable to work everyday and lives in his other 's garage . You 're the last stop , and I 'm desperate .
MARGARET: I will never publish your book . Ever .
MR. GILBERTSON: There 's no need to make this difficult . I do n't turn in your file until Monday
MARGARET: This is blackmail . I 'll go to your boss .
MR. GILBERTSON: I 've spent two years preparing for this day . Do n't you think I 've thought of that ?
RICHARD: Excuse me , Ms. Mills , risk management needs you right away .
MARGARET: Know what , Dante ? I 'm not going anywhere ! We 're getting married !
RICHARD: Who 's getting married ?
MARGARET: We are !
RICHARD: You and him ?
MARGARET: Stop playing around , honey .
MR. GILBERTSON: You are marrying your male secretary ?
RICHARD: Assistant .
MR. GILBERTSON: You are marrying your male assistant ?
MARGARET: We 're in love . We tried to fight it . When it 's right , it 's right .
MR. GILBERTSON: And this has nothing to do with my visit here today ?
MARGARET: Nope . True love . Got it bad .
MR. GILBERTSON: You . Is this true ? Are you marrying this woman ?
MARGARET: Of course we are .
RICHARD: Uh-huh .
MR. GILBERTSON: Five years in prison and a two hundred and fifty thousand dollar fine .
MARGARET: What ?
MR. GILBERTSON: If I prove you 're lying , you go to federal prison for five years . Gilbertson takes out a pad and takes notes . MR. GILBERTSON You . Do you know what you 're getting yourself into ? We 're going to put you in a oom and ask you every detail that a real couple would know about each other . Do you even know her favorite color ?
MARGARET: C'mon . Answer . You do n't have a choice . Richard does n't want to do this , but relents .
RICHARD: Plum .
MR. GILBERTSON: You mean purple ?
RICHARD: No . Plum is `` smokier '' than purple .
MR. GILBERTSON: Favorite flower ?
RICHARD: Tulips . But only when they 're in season .
MR. GILBERTSON: Childhood pet name ?
RICHARD: Miss Mittens .
MARGARET: Are we done here ?
MR. GILBERTSON: Who knows you 're getting married ? Margaret interrupts .
MARGARET: No one . With us working together we decided it would be too much of a scandal if anyone knew .
MR. GILBERTSON: Have you at least told your family ?
EXCITED: My parents are dead !
MR. GILBERTSON: How convenient . So you 're not telling anyone that you are getting married ?
RICHARD: Nope . Gilbertson smiles and puts down his pad .
MR. GILBERTSON: Pathetic . Four questions and I 've got enough to send you to prison
MARGARET: We 're telling his family this weekend .
RICHARD: We are ?
MARGARET: Yes . We are . We 're surprising them at his Grandma 's 90th birthday party .
MR. GILBERTSON: And where 's that going to be ?
MARGARET: At Richard 's parent 's house .
MR. GILBERTSON: And where 's that located ?
MARGARET: In his hometown .
RICHARD: Sitka .
MR. GILBERTSON: Is that on Long Island ?
MARGARET: Why do n't you tell him ?
RICHARD: Alaska .
MR. GILBERTSON: You 're going to Alaska this weekend ?
MARGARET: Yes . Of course we 're going to Alaska . That 's where Richard is from .
MR. GILBERTSON: You think you can beat me with this B-S story ? Forcing your secretary
RICHARD: Assistant .
MR. GILBERTSON: assistant to marry you and then conveniently telling his family for the first time this weekend ?
MARGARET: I 'm sorry , Dante . Did you not prepare fo that ?
MR. GILBERTSON: The INS will see you both in ten days fo your official interview . Your stories etter match up on every account .
MARGARET: There are no `` T 's '' or `` I 's '' in `` Love '' Mr. Gilbertson .
RICHARD: I quit .
MARGARET: Richard , come back here . Margaret tries not to make a scene . MARGARET Richard . Richard .
RICHARD: You shut up . You just lost your `` I get to tell Richard what to do '' privileges .
MARGARET: Well , we need to talk .
RICHARD: You want to talk with me ? Fine . Grab you oom and let 's go .
MARGARET: Well I 'd rather poke my eyes out than play pretend girlfriend , but this is the big time . Sometimes you need to sack up .
RICHARD: Are n't Canadians supposed to be nice ?
MARGARET: You wan na be an editor ? You need to make
RICHARD: OK. Fine . Then if we `` make this happen '' ? You 're promoting me to editor .
MARGARET: I 'm doing what ?
RICHARD: We go to Alaska and lie to my family ? I isk going to jail ? Well , you 're making me editor for that . I mean , did you think I 'd do this out of the kindness of my heart ?
MARGARET: You work for me !
RICHARD: You know , during my employee orientation , the HR rep did n't mention anything about me marrying you .
MARGARET: Look , I came to this town alone and with nothing . I 've worked my ass off for fifteen years and this guy wants to ruin me because he wrote the shittiest book of all time ? No way .
RICHARD: Nice story Little Orphan Annie , but that sounds like your problem . Not mine .
MARGARET: Fine . You take me to Alaska this weekend , and I 'll make you editor . Deal ?
RICHARD: No . But they have huts . Teepees really . And you have to poop in a bucket . But otherwise , just like the Four Seasons . But with bears .
MARGARET: Are you done with the press release ?
RICHARD: Almost .
PATRONIZING: Well let 's finish big people business before mommy and daddy talk . Okay ? Dejected , Richard goes back to work .
MARGARET: So what do I need to know up there ? Bullet points .
RICHARD: I told ‘ em we 've been dating for six months . We 've kept it a secret from everyone and that you 're a naughty minx in the sack .
VENOMOUS: Do n't make me hate you .
RICHARD: Bringing her home to meet my folks . She 's
GATE ATTENDANT: I do n't care , sir .
RICHARD: OK then . You 're a sweet lady . Thanks .
MARGARET: I 'm sorry , I hate it when people stare at what I 'm reading . It 's just I worked on that book .
HANDSOME MAN: You wrote it ?
MARGARET: Edited it . It was one of my favorites .
HANDSOME MAN: Well you did a good job . It 's great .
MARGARET: You do n't see many guys with that book . You , uh , read a lot of love stories about Roman concubines ?
HANDSOME MAN: My ex-girlfriend gave it to me . I travel a lot for work . I 'll read anything
SUSPICIOUS: Ex-girlfriend , huh ?
MARGARET: There you are . Give me my lap top .
RICHARD: Hey , he 's reading
MARGARET: I know , Richard .
HANDSOME MAN: Did you two want to sit together ?
MARGARET: Sit together with who ? The Handsome man nods at Richard .
HANDSOME MAN: Your boyfriend ? Margaret points to Richard indignantly .
MARGARET: You mean him ?
HANDSOME MAN: You 're bringing your assistant all the way to Alaska ?
RICHARD: Oh , you can tell him the truth .
MARGARET: Well , he 's indispensable .
RICHARD: That 's me .
HANDSOME MAN: You 're awfully nice to fly him first class .
ALL: There he is ! ! ! Where 's Margaret ?
HANDSOME MAN: That 's sweet .
RICHARD: What are you guys doing here ? What 's with the sign ?
DEBBIE: So you 're `` just dating , '' huh ? I ca n't elieve you did n't tell us !
RICHARD: Did n't tell you what ?
ANNIE: We 're not saying anything until you let us meet Margaret . Now , where 's our girl ?
RICHARD: Uh . Margaret ? You need to come over here . Like now . Honey .
MARGARET: I have to go now .
HANDSOME MAN: What kind of sick shit is this ?
MARGARET: Have a great life .
RICHARD: Everyone , this is Margaret .
GRANDMA ANNIE: It 's nice to meet you . Now , do you prefe eing called Margaret , or the Dragon Lady ? We 've heard it both ways . Everyone laughs .
DEBBIE: Annnie !
GRANDMA ANNIE: It 's not like he has n't told her that he used to call her the Dragon Lady . They 're getting married .
RICHARD: Now , ah , where did you hear that ? The whole `` getting married '' thing ?
DEBBIE: Oh , that man from the government . Gilber- something . Said he was checking up on you two . Said it was technicality , because Margaret was from Canada .
RICHARD: What , ah , did you tell him ?
DEBBIE: Well for one thing , that you were in a lot of trouble for not telling us that you two were getting married !
RICHARD: No . Really . What did you say ?
DEBBIE: Just that you were coming up here this weekend . That we had n't seen you in a while , and that we 'd heard about Margaret for years , but that we 'd never met her .
MARGARET: Me neither .
DEBBIE: So why all the silly secrecy ?
RICHARD: It was n't a secret . We did n't tell anyone .
DEBBIE: Well , is your family just anyone ?
RICHARD: No , I did n't mean
DEBBIE: I should be mad at you two . But , but I 'm just so excited !
MARGARET: Uh , is everyone coming to our hotel ?
GRANDMA ANNIE: Oh , we cancelled your reservation . You 're part of the family now . Family does n't stay at a hotel . Also , we 've got anothe little surprise for you two .
MARGARET: Surprise ? Another surprise ?
RICHARD: She 's not good with surprises .
MARGARET: I 'm really not good with surprises .
DEBBIE: Well you two
GRANDMA ANNIE: you 're getting married this weekend !
DEBBIE: When Gilber-something told us you were getting married
DEBBIE: God rest their souls
GRANDMA ANNIE: or friends
DEBBIE: we decided to give you a wedding .
GRANDMA ANNIE: Engagement party tonight
DEBBIE: and the wedding tomorrow at midnight .
MARGARET: Are you witches ?
GRANDMA ANNIE: Just quaint . During the solstice it 's good luck . It 's an Alaskan thing .
DEBBIE: We 've planned everything .
GRANDMA ANNIE: I 'm old , Margaret . I do n't have much time left . Richard lives so far away , and I never see him . Now I find out he 's getting married , and I have a chance to see my one grandchild 's wedding day . It 's a dream come
MOUTHING: The Dragon Lady ! ? Richard shrugs .
GRANDMA ANNIE: To tell you the truth , we had a lot of the plans made already for my birthday . Just a few changes here and there , and we made this weekend a wedding . Margaret stares at Richard .
MARGARET: I 'm a lucky woman . Margaret does her best to smile .
RICHARD: Come on , it 'll be OK . I promise .
MARGARET: Who are you people ? Richard lets Margaret wonder .
GEOFFREY: So you must be Margaret . We 've heard a lot about you . All of it bad .
MARGARET: I thought it was the dragon lady ?
GEOFFREY: Either way .
RICHARD: Hey dad .
GEOFFREY: Welcome home . Good to see ‘ ya .
RICHARD: You too .
GEOFFREY: Been a while .
RICHARD: Yeah . You 'd think you could make it to the airport to mark the occasion . Grandma Annie interrupts .
GRANDMA ANNIE: Help him with the bags Geoffrey . Let 's get you two settled .
DEBBIE: We 'll show you around later .
MARGARET: Uh huh .
DEBBIE: Balzac ! Down ! No !
MARGARET: What a great name . Balzac 's `` Lost Illusions '' is one of my favorite novels .
DEBBIE: Oh . Well , this Balzac 's got epididymitis .
GEOFFREY: And do n't let him outside , or the eagles will snatch him .
RICHARD: C'mon dad
GEOFFREY: I mean it . They come out of that ehabilitation center mean . And hungry .
RICHARD: Do n't listen to him , Margaret .
DEBBIE: You 'll be sleeping here .
MARGARET: Thank you . Where 's Richard 's room ?
DEBBIE: Oh , we took down his `` shrine '' years ago . And do n't worry , I 'm under no illusion that you two have n't slept in the same bed efore . Richard can sleep here too .
MARGARET: Oh , let 's not upset Grandma Annie .
DEBBIE: It was her idea . Anything to help get her a great grandchild .
MARGARET: Great . You know , I 've gotten used to his eathing at night .
DEBBIE: I thought so dear .
MARGARET: I 'm about 15 seconds from bitch .
RICHARD: Calm down .
MARGARET: What is going on here ?
RICHARD: Hell if I know .
MARGARET: You had no idea they knew about us getting married ?
RICHARD: You think I 'd bring you here if I did ?
MARGARET: Well , we just got ta tell ‘ em .
RICHARD: Tell ‘ em what ?
MARGARET: Tell ‘ em the truth . About us .
RICHARD: Wrong answer . No way .
MARGARET: What do you mean no way ? This is crazy .
RICHARD: No , crazy was lying to the federal officer .
MARGARET: Well I do n't like this .
RICHARD: Well I 'm not making my Gammy an accomplice to a Class C felony ! For one second could you not be so selfish ?
MARGARET: Selfish ?
RICHARD: Yeah , you know , that thing you do where you only worry about yourself every second of every day ?
MARGARET: How is it selfish to tell the truth ?
RICHARD: Look . We 're awful , awful people . In the last forty eight hours , we 've lied to everyone . We need to protect the people downstairs . We ca n't ask these good , decent , not awful people to lie for us . Let 's keep the darkside to ourselves . Margaret takes a second to make up her mind .
MARGARET: Fine . But if we do this , you need to stop lying to me .
RICHARD: What 've I lied to you about ?
MARGARET: Why did you tell me that you were poor ?
RICHARD: I never said that .
MARGARET: Well , you never told me you were rich .
RICHARD: When does that come up ?
MARGARET: I do n't know , how about , `` Hi , my name is Richard , I 'm an Alaskan titan of industry . ''
RICHARD: Well , maybe I did n't tell you because you would have fired me if you knew .
MARGARET: No I would n't .
RICHARD: Come on ! You 're always yammering on about your scrappy childhood , and how you fought for those soccer scholarships , and how the ich kids made fun of you in prep school fo
MARGARET: I 'm not anti-rich .
RICHARD: Oh yes you are ! And you know what makes it worse ? You have money !
MARGARET: I earned
RICHARD: every penny I have . Blah , blah , blah . You need new material .
MARGARET: Hey . Watch it . You 're still my assistant .
RICHARD: You were going to promote me anyway .
MARGARET: Sure of that ?
RICHARD: Nope . Not at all .
MARGARET: Well , come on . If we 're going to do this , we might as well put on a show .
RICHARD: Be right back .
MARGARET: Since I graduated college .
RICHARD: She 's been there since she was nineteen .
GEOFFREY: Nineteen ? Wow . That 's how long ?
MARGARET: Oh , who 's counting
GEOFFREY: No . How many years is that ? Exactly . Margaret gives Geoffrey the slightest look .
MARGARET: Well , let me see . That would be sixteen o seventeen years . Exactly .
GEOFFREY: I was never good with big numbers . That makes you thirty six now ?
MARGARET: Just turned thirty seven . Born on May 20th . I 'm a Taurus .
RICHARD: There 's some salmon . Margaret shakes her head no . RICHARD Crab ?
GEOFFREY: Keep him on a short leash , huh ? Does he oll over when you whistle ? Debbie hits Geoffrey .
DEBBIE: He 's just being a good host .
MARGARET: Thank you , honey . You 're being so sweet .
RICHARD: Uh , sure . Honey .
MARGARET: I 'm editor in chief , now .

GEOFFREY: You 're only a secretary . This pisses Richard off immediately .
RICHARD: Again with the secretary thing ! I 've told you , I 'm an assistant !
GEOFFREY: Just because you call yourself an `` assistant '' does n't mean you 're not really just a secretary .

MARGARET: You must have
GERTRUDE: freaked out ? Oh you bet . I broke up with him on the spot .
MARGARET: I would hope so .

MARGARET: Can we not talk about this ?
RICHARD: I 'm just saying . It was weird .
MARGARET: It was n't weird .
RICHARD: How was that not weird ?
MARGARET: Because we 're like teammates .

RICHARD: When Gert crushed my heart into little pieces , a life up here did n't seem so great anymore .
MARGARET: So you moved to the open arms of New York City ?
RICHARD: At first it was about getting as far away from this place as possible , but then I fell in love with it .
MARGARET: With scheduling my pilates ?
RICHARD: With editing . See , as an only kid I 'd always read a lot , but until I worked fo you I did n't love it . I mean , when I ealized that we could find the next Cuckoo 's Nest , or Catch 22 , or
MARGARET: To Kill a Mockingbird . It 's all about To Kill a Mockingbird .
RICHARD: Exactly ! We could find the next To Kill a Mockingbird . God damn , how great is that ?

RICHARD: Yeah . Thanks .
MARGARET: One more question

RICHARD: You have no idea .
MARGARET: Should you leave the cart ?
RICHARD: It 's our cart . I did n't know you were such a prude .
MARGARET: I 've come to realize that being my assistant gave you more access to my life than I eve imagined , but there are a few things you do n't know about me .

SAM: Call your boss and tell him you 're taking the rest of the afternoon off . It 's Friday anyway and hot .
MARY: What do I do with my free afternoon , walk you to the airport ?
SAM: We could laze around here a while longer .
MARY: Checking out time is three P.M. Hotels of this sort are n't interested in you when you come in , but when you time 's up Sam , I hate having to be with you in a place like this .
SAM: I 've heard of married couples who deliberately spend occasional nights in cheap hotels . They say it
MARY: When you 're married you can do a lot of things deliberately .
SAM: You sure talk like a girl who 's been married .
MARY: Sam !
SAM: I 'm sorry , Mary . My old Dad used to say 'when you ca n't change a situation , laugh at it . ' Nothing ridicules a thing like laughing at it .
MARY: I 've lost my girlish laughter .
SAM: The only girlish thing you have lost .
MARY: Sam . This is the last time .
SAM: For what ?
MARY: This ! Meeting you in secret so we can be secretive ! You come down here on business trips and we steal lunch hours and I wish you would n't even come .

MARY: I have n't time to argue . I 'm a working girl .
SAM: And I 'm a working man ! We 're a regula working-class tragedy !
MARY: It is tragic ! Or it will be if we go on meeting in shabby hotels whenever you can find a tax-deductible excuse for flying down deductible here
SAM: You ca n't laugh at it , huh ?
MARY: Can you ?
SAM: Sure . It 's like laughing through a oken jaw , but
MARY: You could n't be a criminal if you committed a major crime .
SAM: I wish I were . Not an active criminal ut a nice guy with the conscience of a criminal . Next best thing to no conscience at all .
MARY: I have to go , Sam .
SAM: I can come down next week .
MARY: No .
SAM: Not even just to see you , to have lunch in public ?
MARY: We can see each other , we can even have dinner but respectably , in my house with my mother 's picture on the mantel and my sister helping me oil a big steak for three !
SAM: And after the steak do we send Sister to the movies and turn Mama 's picture to the wall ?
MARY: Sam ! No !
SAM: All right .
MARY: You make respectability sound disrespectful .
SAM: I 'm all for it ! It requires patience and temperance and a lot of sweating- out otherwise , though , it 's only hard work . But if I can see you , touch you even as simply as this I wo n't mind .
MARY: I pay , too . They also pay who meet in hotel rooms .
SAM: A couple of years and the debts will e paid off . And if she ever re- marries , the alimony stops and then
MARY: I have n't even been married once yet !
SAM: Yeah , but when you do you 'll swing .
MARY: Sam , let 's go get married .
SAM: And live with me in a storeroom behind a hardware store in Fairvale . We 'll have a lot of laughs . When I send my ex-wife her money , you can lick the stamps .

WOMAN'S VOICE: Mother , she 's just a stranger ! As if men do n't desire strangers , as if oh , I refuse to speak of disgusting things because they disgust me ! You understand , Boy ?
NORMAN'S VOICE: Shut up ! Shut up !
MARY: I 've caused you some trouble .
NORMAN: Mother what is the phrase `` she is n't herself today '' I think that 's it .
MARY: You should n't have bothered . I really do n't have that much of an appetite .
NORMAN: I 'm sorry . I wish people could apologize for other people .
MARY: Do n't worry about it . But as long as you 've made us supper , we may as well eat it . Huh ?
NORMAN: It might be nicer warmer in the office .
MARY: You 're very kind .
NORMAN: It 's all for you . I 'm not hungry . Please go ahead .
MARY: You 'd know , of course .
NORMAN: Not really . I hear that expression , that one eats `` like a bird , '' is really a falsie , I mean a falsity , because irds eat a tremendous lot . Oh , I do n't know anything about birds . My hobby is stuffing things taxidermy . And I guess I 'd just rathe stuff birds because well , I hate the look of beasts when they 're stuffed , foxes and chimps and all some people even stuff dogs and cats but I ca n't I think only irds look well stuffed because they 're rather passive , to begin with most of them
MARY: It 's a strange hobby . Curious , I mean .
NORMAN: Uncommon , too .
MARY: I imagine so .
NORMAN: It 's not as expensive as you 'd think . Cheap , really . Needles , thread , sawdust .. the chemicals are all that cost anything .
MARY: A man should have a hobby .
NORMAN: It 's more than a hobby sometimes a hobby is supposed to pass the time , not fill it .
MARY: Is your time so empty ?
NORMAN: Oh , no ! I run the office , tend the cabins and grounds , do little chores fo mother the ones she allows I might e capable of doing .
MARY: You go out with friends ?
NORMAN: Friends ? Who needs friends . A boy 's best friend is his mother . You 've never had an empty moment in your whole life . Have you ?
MARY: Only my share .
NORMAN: Where are you going ? I do n't mean to pry
MARY: I 'm looking for a private island .
NORMAN: What are you running away from ?
MARY: Why do you ask that ?
NORMAN: No . People never run away from anything . The rain did n't last very long . You know what I think ? I think we 're all in our private traps , clamped in them , and none of us can ever clim out . We scratch and claw but only at the air , only at each other , and for all of it , we never budge an inch .
MARY: Sometimes we deliberately step into those traps .
NORMAN: I was born in mine . I do n't mind it anymore .
MARY: You should mind it .
NORMAN: Oh I do but I say I do n't .
MARY: If anyone ever spoke to me , the way I heard The way she spoke to you , I do n't think I could ever laugh again .
NORMAN: Sometimes when she talks that way to me I 'd like to curse her out and leave her forever ! Or at least , defy her . But I could n't . She 's ill .
MARY: She sounded strong
NORMAN: I mean ill. She had to raise me all by herself after my dad died I was only five and it must have been a strain . Oh , she did n't have to go out to work or anything , Dad left us with a little something anyway , a few years ago Mother met a man . He talked her into building this motel We could have talked he into anything and when . Well It was just too much for her when he died , too And the way he died Oh , it 's nothing to talk about when you 're eating . Anyway , it was too much of a loss for my mother she had nothing left .
MARY: Except you .
NORMAN: A son is a poor substitute for a lover .
MARY: Why do n't you go away ?
NORMAN: To a private island , like you ?
MARY: No , not like me .
NORMAN: It 's too late for me . And besides who 'd look after her ? She 'd be alone up there , the fire would go out damp and cold , like a grave . When you love someone , you do n't do that to them , even if you hate them . Oh , I do n't hate her . I hate what she 's become . I hate the illness .
MARY: Would n't it be better if you put he in someplace
NORMAN: An Institution ? A madhouse ? People always call a madhouse `` someplace . '' Put her in Someplace !
MARY: I 'm sorry I did n't mean it to sound uncaring
NORMAN: What do you mean about caring ? Have you ever seen one of those places ? Inside ? Laughing and tears and cruel eyes studying you and my mothe there ? Why ? has she harmed you ? She 's as harmless as one of these stuffed birds .
MARY: I am sorry . I only felt it seemed she was harming you . I meant
NORMAN: Well ? You meant well ? People always mean well , they cluck their thick tongues and shake their heads and suggest so very delicately that
MARY: Yes , and just one time can be enough . Thank you .
NORMAN: Thank you , Norman .
MARY: Norman .
NORMAN: You 're not going to to your room already ?
MARY: I 'm very tired . And I 'll have a long drive tomorrow . All the way back to Phoenix .
NORMAN: Phoenix ?
MARY: I stepped into a private trap back there and I want to go back and try to pull myself out . Before it 's too late for me , too .
NORMAN: Why do n't you stay a little while , just for talking .
MARY: I 'd like to , but
NORMAN: Alright . I 'll see you in the morning . I 'll bring you breakfast . What time will you
MARY: Very early . Dawn .
NORMAN: Alright , Miss
MARY: Crane .
NORMAN: That 's it .
MARY: Good night .
NORMAN'S VOICE: Mother ! Oh God , what blood , lood mother !

SAM: What should I know ?
LILA: To begin with , where Mary is . Do you ?
SAM: No . I take it you do n't either ? How long ?
LILA: Last Friday . She left work , and home I was in Tucson over the weekend I have n't heard from her , not even a phone call .
SAM: And you thought she 'd come up here , to me ? If she had , what reason would she have for not calling you ?
LILA: A good reason , I suppose .
SAM: Well what do you think , we eloped o something ? Or we 're living in sin and
LILA: Mr. Loomis , you 're so busy being defensive that you have n't even eacted to the most serious fact of all . Mary is missing .
SAM: I was getting to that !
LILA: What do you know about it ?
SAM: Nothing ! You 're putting me on the defensive .
LILA: Look , if you two are in this thing together , I do n't care , it 's none of my business But I want to see Mary . I want her to tell me she 's all right and it 's none of my usiness . Then I 'll go back to Phoenix and
SAM: Bob ? Run out and get yourself some lunch .
SUMMERFIELD: It 's okay , Sam , I brought it with me .
SAM: Run out and eat it .
LILA: Huh ?
SAM: What thing could we be in together ?
LILA: I hate tears .
SAM: Is Mary in trouble ?
LILA: Yes .
SAM: Well why did n't she come to me call me ?
LILA: Not that kind You men and your egos .
SAM: Never mind my ego . Let 's talk about Mary .
ARBOGAST: Let 's all talk about Mary .
SAM: Who are you , friend ?
ARBOGAST: Milt Arbogast , Private Investigator . Where is she , Miss Crane ?
LILA: I do n't know .
ARBOGAST: Would n't have been able to tail you if you did .
SAM: What 's your interest ?
ARBOGAST: Money .
SAM: Somebody better tell me what 's going on and tell me fast ! I can take so much and then
ARBOGAST: Your girl friend stole forty thousand dollars .
SAM: Why ?
ARBOGAST: Must 've needed it .
SAM: What are you talking about ? What is this ?
LILA: She was supposed to bank it , on Friday , for her boss . She did n't . And no one has seen her since .
ARBOGAST: Someone has seen her . Someone always sees a girl with forty thousand dollars . She is your girl friend , is n't she ?
LILA: Sam , they do n't want to prosecute , they just want the money back . It was all in cash
ARBOGAST: Casharoonie !
LILA: Sam , if she 's here
SAM: She is n't !
ARBOGAST: You came up here on a hunch , Miss Crane ? Nothing more ? No phone call from him , or from your sister herself ?
LILA: Not even a hunch . Just hope .
ARBOGAST: With a little checking , I could get to believe you .
LILA: I do n't care if you do or I want to see Mary before she gets in any deeper
SAM: Did you check in Phoenix hospitals maybe she had an accident a hold-up
ARBOGAST: She was seen leaving town in he car . Seen by her very victims , I might add .
SAM: I do n't believe it . Do you ?
LILA: Yes I just did . The moment they told me
SAM: You might have doubted for say five minutes or so , Sister .
ARBOGAST: We 're always quickest to doubt people who have a record for being honest . I think she 's here , Miss Crane . Where there 's a boyfriend She wo n't be back there among the nuts and bolts but she 'll be in this town somewhere . I 'll find her .
LILA: I just listened and believed everything they told me . 'She stole the money . ' 'We do n't want to get her in trouble . ' 'No do n't bring the police in '
SAM: It was her boss ' idea not to report it to the police ?
LILA: No . The man whose money she he talked so loud and fast , and I I should 've called the police .
SAM: He must have had a darn good reason for wanting them kept out of it All that cash
LILA: I ought to call the police right now !
SAM: No .
LILA: Why not ? Sam , is she hiding here ? Are you two planning to go away with the money ?
SAM: How could I go away ? I 'm in debt up to my If she did steal that money It 's hard to believe she did because it 's hard to see why she would . Unless she had some wild idea that it would help me us
LILA: She have n't even called you ?
SAM: I did n't see her and I did n't hear from her ! Believe that !
LILA: I need to I need to believe something . This is the first time I 've ever come up against anything I could n't understand .
SAM: You 've led a charmed life .
LILA: No . I just think anything can be explained . But Mary , doing a thing like this I do n't know how to handle
SAM: Maybe we can handle it together .
LILA: I came flying up here expecting to get some explanation for all I know , she may be trying to get in touch with me , at home . I 'd bette go home .
SAM: I think she 'll contact me if she contacts anybody . Why do n't you stay here . When she shows up or calls e here .
LILA: You want me to stay here ?
SAM: She 'll need both of us .
LILA: Where can I stay ?
SAM: First rate hotel , fifty yards up the street . Come on . After we check you in we 'll go to the drugstore and get you a sandwich . Then we 'll come back here and wait .
NORMAN: I always forget to put the sign on , ut we do have vacancy . Twelve in fact . Twelve cabins , twelve vacancies .
ARBOGAST: In the past two days I 've been to so many motels , my eyes are bleary with neon . This is the first one that looked like it was hiding from the world at large .
NORMAN: I do n't really forget the sign , it just does n't seem any use . This used to be the main highway . Want to register , please ?
ARBOGAST: Sit down . I do n't want to trouble you , just want to ask
NORMAN: No trouble . Today 's linen day . I change all the beds once a week , whether they 've been used or not dampness . I hate the smell of dampness . It 's such a dank smell .
ARBOGAST: No .
NORMAN: Oh . I thought you said you 'd been to so many in two days What was it you wanted to ask ?
ARBOGAST: I 'm looking for a missing person . My name 's Arbogast , private investigator Trying to trace a young girl who 's een missing almost a week . From Phoenix . It 's a private matter family wants to forgive her She is n't in trouble .
NORMAN: I did n't think the police went searching for people who were n't in trouble .
ARBOGAST: I 'm not the police .
NORMAN: Oh .
ARBOGAST: We have reason to believe she came this way might have stopped in this area Did she stop here ?
NORMAN: No . No one has stopped here in weeks
ARBOGAST: Mind looking at the picture before committing yourself ?
NORMAN: Committing myself to what ? You sure talk like a Policeman .
ARBOGAST: Look at the picture . Please .
NORMAN: No . At least I do n't recall .
ARBOGAST: She might have used an alias . Mary Crane 's the real name , but she might 've registered
NORMAN: I do n't even bother with guests egistering any more I mean , little y little , you drop the formalities . I should n't even bother to change the linen . I guess habits die hard . Which reminds me He goes to the wall , flips a light switch .
ARBOGAST: Now there 's a couple even remarking about your sign , and see how easily you forgot them ?
NORMAN: What ?
ARBOGAST: You thought no one has stopped here in weeks . Now , try to remember if this girl
NORMAN: I did n't lie to you . I just have trouble keeping track of time .
ARBOGAST: Tell me all about her .
NORMAN: She arrived kind of late , wet and hungry and she was very tired and went right to bed and left early .
ARBOGAST: How early ?
NORMAN: Very early . Dawn .
ARBOGAST: Of which morning ?
NORMAN: The following morning . Sunday .
ARBOGAST: No one met her ?
NORMAN: No .
ARBOGAST: Or arrived with her .
NORMAN: No .
ARBOGAST: She did n't call anyone ? Even locally ?
NORMAN: No .
ARBOGAST: You did n't spend the whole night with her did you ?
NORMAN: No ! Of all
ARBOGAST: How do you know she did n't make a call ?
NORMAN: She was tired . She said she had a long drive ahead of her , in the morning Yes , now I 'm remembering very clearly because I 'm picturing . When you make a picture of the moment in your mind , you can remember every detail . She was sitting back there , no she was standing up , with some sandwich still in her hand , and she said she had to drive a long way .
ARBOGAST: Back where ?
NORMAN: What do you mean ?
ARBOGAST: You said she was sitting `` back there , '' or standing rather
NORMAN: Oh . My private parlor . She had an awful hunger so I made her some supper . And then she went to bed and left in the morning . I did n't even see her leave .
ARBOGAST: How did she pay you ?
NORMAN: What ?
ARBOGAST: Cash or check ? For the cabin
NORMAN: Cash .
ARBOGAST: And when she left , she never came ack .
NORMAN: Why should she ? I 'm sorry , I have work to do , Mr if you do n't mind
ARBOGAST: I do mind . If it do n't jell , it ai n't aspic ! This ai n't jelling .
NORMAN: I do n't know what you expect me to know about people come and go
ARBOGAST: She is n't still here , is she ?
NORMAN: Not at all !
ARBOGAST: Suppose I wanted to search the cabins , all twelve would I need a warrant ?
NORMAN: Look , if you wo n't believe me , go ahead . You can help me make beds if you like . Come on .
ARBOGAST: Anyone at home ?
NORMAN: I live there . Alone .
ARBOGAST: Someone is sitting in that window .
NORMAN: My mother . Arbogast turns , gazes seriously at him .
ARBOGAST: If this girl Mary Crane were here , you 'd have no reason to hide he would you ?
NORMAN: Of course not .
ARBOGAST: If she paid you well ?
NORMAN: Now , look !
ARBOGAST: Or if she had you say gallantly protecting her you would n't be fooled you 'd know she was just using you . Would n't you ?
NORMAN: I 'm not a fool ! And I 'm not capable of being fooled ! Not even by women !
ARBOGAST: I did n't mean that as a slur on you manhood . I 'm sorry .
NORMAN: That 's all right . maybe she could have fooled me . But She did n't fool my mother .
ARBOGAST: Your mother met her ? Can I talk to your mother ?
NORMAN: No . I told you , she 's confined
ARBOGAST: Just for a moment . She might have picked up a hint you 'd miss .
NORMAN: No ! Just no ! I have one of those eaking points like any other man , elieve it or not , and I 'm near it . There 's just so much pushing I can take and I think
ARBOGAST: All right ! Might save me a lot of leg-work if I could just talk to your mother . But I 'd need a warrant for that , wo n't
ARBOGAST: Miss Crane , please . She leave a number ? Thanks . Lila there , Mr. Loomis ? Arbogast . Lila ? Look , this is n't much , but it might make you feel a little better . Mary was up here . Spent last Saturday night at Bates ' Motel , out here on the old highway . Young fellow runs it , said Mary spent the night , left , period ! I did question him , believe me . I think I got all there was to get . Just have to try to pick up the scent from here . Well maybe that 's because I do n't feel entirely satisfied . He 's got a sick old mother , confined type , and I think she saw Mary and talked to her . Shame , too confined old women love to talk to strangers . I was , but I think I 'll go back to the motel , first . No , you stay put , Lila . With Loomis . I should be back in an hour . All right . And Lila You 'll be happy to know what I think . I think our friend Sam Loomis did n't even know Mary was here . See you in an hour . Or less . He hangs up , gets out of the phone booth .
SAM: Sometimes Saturday night has a lonely sound . Ever notice , Lila ?
LILA: Sam . He said an hour . Or less .
SAM: It 's been three .
LILA: Are we just going to go on sitting here ?
SAM: He 'll be back . Let 's sit still and hang on , okay ?
LILA: You have an awfully nice habit , Sam .
SAM: Hundreds ! Which one is your pet ?
LILA: Whenever I start contemplating the panic button , your back straightens up and your eyes get that God-looks- out-for-everybody look and I feel etter .
SAM: I feel better when you feel better .
LILA: Where 's the old highway ?
SAM: You want to run out there , bust in on Arbogast and the sick old lady , shake her up and maybe spoil everything Arbogast 's been building for the last three hours .
LILA: Yes .
SAM: That would n't be a wise thing to do .
LILA: Patience does n't run in our family . Sam , I 'm going out there !
SAM: Arbogast said
LILA: An hour ! Or less !
SAM: Got the number of the motel out on the old highway ? Bates , I think .
LILA: Sam ! Why call when we can go ?
SAM: And maybe pass Arbogast on the road ? Thanks .
LILA: Sam , I 'm going .
SAM: You 'll never find it .
LILA: Why ca n't I go out there with you ?
SAM: I do n't know One of us has to be here in case Arbogast 's on the way .
LILA: Just wait here ?
SAM: Contemplate your panic button .
SAM: Arbogast ?
SAM: He did n't come back here ?
LILA: Sam .
SAM: No Arbogast . No Bates . And only the old lady at home A sick old lady unable to answer the door or unwilling .
LILA: Where could he have gone ?
SAM: Maybe he got some definite lead . Maybe he went right on
LILA: Without calling me ?
SAM: In a hurry .
LILA: Sam , he called me when he had nothing definite , nothing but a dissatisfied feeling . Do n't you think he 'd have called if he had anything
SAM: Yes . I think he would have .
LILA: Who 's he ?
SAM: He 's the Deputy Sheriff around here . As he starts forward .
LILA: Well ?
SAM: Nothing . Just all the lights out must be asleep .
LILA: Does that mean we ca n't
SAM: No . I 'm just procrastinating . People hate when the doorbell rings in the middle of the night . Come on .
MRS. CHAMBERS: Oh ?
SAM: Sorry , Mrs . Chambers . I hate bothering you
MRS. CHAMBERS: You did n't ! It 's tinkerbell . Al wants to be sure he 'll hear it if anyone rings it in the middle of the night . Well come on in , at least ! As she opens the door wide ,
SAM: We have a problem .
MRS. CHAMBERS: Let 's go out back and have some coca while the men are talking .
LILA: No , thank you . It 's my problem , too .
SAM: I do n't know where to start Except at the beginning .
LILA: Yes .
SAM: This is Lila Crane , from Phoenix . She 's been here for a few days , looking for her sister . There 's a private detective helping and , well , we got a call tonight , from this detective , saying he 'd traced Mary
MRS. CHAMBERS: Mary is Lila 's sister ?
SAM: Yes . He traced her to that motel , out on the old highway
MRS. CHAMBERS: Bates ' Motel . He has a mind like a mechanical brain and the more information you feed it Go on , Sam .
SAM: He traced her there and called us to say he was going to question Mrs. Bates
MRS. CHAMBERS: Norman took a wife ?
SAM: No . An old woman , his mother . That was early this evening . And we have n't seen or heard from him since . I went out to the motel , just got ack . No one was in the office , and
LILA: Will you help us ? I think something 's wrong out there !
SHERIFF: Now . Your sister is missing how long ?
LILA: She left Phoenix a week ago yesterday . And no trace until
SHERIFF: How 'd you and this detective come to trace her to Fairvale ?
SAM: They thought she 'd be coming to me .
SHERIFF: Left Phoenix under her own steam ?
LILA: Yes .
SHERIFF: She ai n't missing so much as she 's un away .
SAM: Yes .
SHERIFF: From what ?
LILA: She stole some money .
SHERIFF: A lot ?
LILA: Forty thousand dollars .
SHERIFF: And the police have n't been able to
SAM: Everyone concerned thought if they could get her to give back the money they could avoid involving her with the police .
SHERIFF: Explains the private detective . He traced her to the Bates place . What 'd he exactly say when he called you ?
LILA: Mary had been there , one night , and had left .
SHERIFF: With the forty thousand dollars ?
LILA: He did n't mention the money . What he said on the phone is n't important , is it ? He was supposed to come back after he spoke to the mother , and he did n't ! That 's what I want you to do something about !
SHERIFF: Like what ?
LILA: Go out there ! Find somebody , ask some questions ! I 'm sorry if I seem over-anxious to you . I keep thinking something 's wrong . I have to know what !
SHERIFF: I think something 's wrong , too , Miss . But not the same thing . I think you private detective is what 's wrong . I think he got himself a hot lead as to where your sister was going probably from Norman Bates and called you to keep you still while he took off after her and the money .
LILA: He said he was dissatisfied and was going back .
MRS. CHAMBERS: Why do n't you call Norman and let him say just what happened , if he give the man a hot lead and he did just scooted off it 'll make the girl feel better , Albert .
SHERIFF: At this hour ?
SAM: He was out when I was there . If he 's ack he probably is n't even in bed yet .
SHERIFF: He was n't out when you were there . He just was n't answering the door in the dead of night like some people do . This fellow lives like a hermit
MRS. CHAMBERS: Recluse . Kinder word .
SHERIFF: You must remember that bad business out there . About ten years ago
SAM: I 've only been here five . Right now it feels like ten , but
LILA: All right ! Then call ! At least , call ! Mrs . Chambers goes to phone , dials operator .
MRS. CHAMBERS: Florrie , the Sheriff wants you to connect him with the Bates Motel .
SHERIFF: Norman ? Sheriff Chambers . Been just fine , thanks . Listen , we got some worries here . Did you have a man stop out there tonight Well , this one would n't be a customer , anyway . A private detective , name of
MRS. CHAMBERS: Arbogast .
SHERIFF: Arbogast . And after he left ? No , it 's okay , Norman . How 's it been going out there ? Well , I think you oughta unload that place and open up closer in to the action , a smaller place , you know ut
LILA: Please !
SHERIFF: Sorry I got you up , boy . Go back to sleep . Yeah , be glad to . Said to give you his regards .
SAM: Was that all ?
SHERIFF: This detective was out there and Norman told him about the girl and the detective thanked him and went away .
LILA: And he did n't go back ? Did n't see the mother ?
SHERIFF: You should 've called in the police the second you found your sister has skipped . You go starting private investigations , using people you do n't even know
LILA: What difference does that
SHERIFF: Your Detective told you a nakedfaced lie .
MRS. CHAMBERS: Barefaced .
SHERIFF: He told you he was n't coming right ack cause he wanted to question Norman Bates ' mother , right ?
LILA: Yes .
SHERIFF: Norman Bates ' mother has been dead and buried in Greenlawn Cemetery fo the last ten years !
MRS. CHAMBERS: I helped Norman pick out the dress she was buried in . Periwinkle blue .
SHERIFF: It ai n't only local history , Sam , it 's the only murder-and-suicide case in Fairvale ledgers ! Mrs. Bates poisoned this guy she was involved with , when she found out he was married , then took a helping of the same stuff herself . Strychnine . Ugly way to die .
MRS. CHAMBERS: Norman found them dead together . In ed .
SAM: You mean that old woman I saw sittin ' in the window was n't Norman Bates ' mother ?
MRS. CHAMBERS: Maybe you saw Mary !
SAM: I 'd know the difference between Mary and an old woman .
SHERIFF: Now wait a minute , Sam . You sure you saw an old woman ?
SAM: Yes ! In the house behind the motel . I pounded and called but she just ignored me .
SHERIFF: And you want to tell me you saw Norman Bates ' mother .
LILA: It must 've been . Arbogast said so , too and he said the young man would n't let him see her because she was ill !
SHERIFF: Well , if the woman up there is Mrs. Bates who 's that woman buried out at Greenlawn Cemetery ?
MOTHER'S VOICE: I am sorry , boy , but you do manage to look ludicrous when you give me orders !
NORMAN'S VOICE: Please , mother
MOTHER'S VOICE: No ! I will not hide in the fruit cellar ! Think I 'm fruity , huh ? I 'm staying right here ! This is my oom and no one will drag me out of it least of all my big bold son !
NORMAN'S VOICE: They 'll come now , Mother . He came after the girl and now someone will come after him ! How long do you think you can go on Mother , please , just for a few days , just so they wo n't find you !
MOTHER'S VOICE: Just for a few days In that dank fruit cellar ? No ! You hid me there once , boy , and you wo n't do it again ! Not ever again ! Now get out ! I told you to get out , boy ! Norman ! What do you think you 're going to do ? Do n't you touch me ! Do n't ! Norman ! All right , son , put me down and I 'll go . I 'll go on my own two feet . I can go on my own two feet , ca n't I ?
NORMAN'S VOICE: I 'll carry you , mother .
SAM: We thought , if you did n't mind , we 'd go out to the motel with you .
MRS. CHAMBERS: He 's already been .
SHERIFF: Went out before service .
MRS. CHAMBERS: Have you two had breakfast ?
SAM: You did n't find anything .
SHERIFF: Nothing . Here , let 's clear the path .
LILA: Did he say anything about my sister ?
SHERIFF: Just what he told your detective .
SAM: No mother .
SHERIFF: You must 've seen an illusion , Sam . Now , I know you 're not the seeing- illusion type But no woman was illusion there and I do n't believe in ghosts , so there it is !
LILA: I still feel
SHERIFF: Can see you do . Sorry I could n't make you feel better . You want to come to my office this afternoon and eport a missing person And the theft , is what you want to do ! Soone you drop this thing in the lap of the law , that 's the sooner you 'll stand a chance of your sister bein ' picked up . How about that ?
LILA: I do n't know .
MRS. CHAMBERS: It 's Sunday . Come over and do the eporting at the house , 'round dinne time . Make it nicer . You too , Sam .
SAM: Maybe I am the seeing-illusions type .
LILA: You 're not .
SAM: Want me to drop you at the hotel ? Or you want to come over to the store ?
LILA: I wo n't feel satisfied unless I got out there , Sam .
SAM: Neither will I .
LILA: I wonder if we 'll ever see Mary again .
SAM: Of course we will .
LILA: Alive .
SAM: Where 'd you go to college ?
LILA: I did n't . I got a job , too . I wonder if that hurt her , my not letting her sacrifice for me ? Some people are so willing to suffer fo you that they suffer more if you do n't let them .
SAM: She was willing to lick the stamps .
LILA: I wonder so many things about he now . Why she never told me about you Funny , when you think there 's an answer to everything , you think you know all the answers .
SAM: We were going to get married . Are going to get married !
LILA: Do you know how I found out about you ? I found one of your letters it was a nice letter , Sam .
SAM: This is the old highway .
LILA: I suppose when you were able to marry her she 'd have presented you , all shiny and proper she always tried to be proper .
SAM: Watch your tenses .
LILA: Huh ?
SAM: She always tries to be proper .
LILA: You going to wait here for me ?
SAM: I 'm going with you . But we 'd bette decide what we 're going to say and do when we walk in
LILA: We 're going to register . As man and wife . And get shown to a cabin and then search every inch of that place , inside and outside .
SAM: You wo n't believe it But this will be the first time I 've ever pulled one of those man- and-wife-renting-cabin capers !
LILA: I believe it . As truck starts to drive on ,
SAM: I wonder where Norman Bates does his hermiting ?
LILA: Someone was at that window . I saw the curtain move . Sam takes Lila 's arm .
SAM: Come on .
NORMAN: I suppose you want a cabin .
SAM: We 'd hoped to make it straight to San Francisco , but we do n't like the look of that sky . Looks like a bad day coming does n't it .
NORMAN: I 'll take you to
SAM: Better sign in first , has n't we ?
NORMAN: It is n't necessary .
SAM: Uh , uh ! My boss is paying for this trip ninety percent business and he wants practically notarized eceipts . I better sign in and get a eceipt .
NORMAN: I 'll get your bags .
SAM: Have n't any .
NORMAN: I 'll show you the cabin .
SAM: First time I 've seen it happen . Check in any place in this country without bags , and you have to pay in advance .
NORMAN: Ten dollars
SAM: That receipt ?
LILA: I 'll start ahead .
SAM: Do n't bother yourself we 'll find it .
LILA: We should have asked for Cabin One The one Mary was in .
SAM: I 'm glad we did n't .
LILA: We have to go into that cabin and search it , Sam no matter what we 're afraid of finding and no matte how much it may hurt .
SAM: I know . Do you think if something happened , it happened there ?
LILA: Sam , if you owned a useless business like this motel one you probably could n't even sell what would you need to get away , to start a new usiness , somewhere else ? Forty thousand dollars ?
SAM: How could we prove Well , if he opens a new motel on the new highway say , a year from now
LILA: There must be some proof that exists ight now ! Something that proves he got that money away from Mary Some way !
SAM: What makes you sound so certain ?
LILA: Arbogast ! Sam , he liked me o felt sorry for me and he was starting to feel the same about you . I heard it when he called in his voice , a caring . He would n't have gone anywhere or done anything without telling us . Unless he was stopped . And he was stopped , so he must have found out something !
SAM: We 'll start with Cabin One .
LILA: Hospital clean .
SAM: What ?
LILA: The bathroom . Look at how clean it is . The one in our cabin is clean ut this is clean !
SAM: What is it ?
LILA: It did n't get washed down . It 's figuring the kind you tear up and get rid of . Some figure has been added to o subtracted from forty thousand .
SAM: Bates never denied Mary was here .
LILA: Yes . But maybe this proves that Bates found out about the money .
SAM: Do we simply ask him where he 's hidden it ?
LILA: Sam , that old woman , whoever she is . I think she told Arbogast something ! And I want her to tell us the same thing !
SAM: You ca n't go up there .
LILA: Why not ?
SAM: Bates .
NORMAN: Looking for me ?
SAM: Yes , matter of fact . The wife 's taking a nap and I can never keep quiet enough for her so I thought I 'd look you up and talk .
NORMAN: Satisfied with your cabin ?
SAM: Fine .
SAM: I 've been doing all the talking so far , have n't I ?
NORMAN: Yes .
SAM: I always thought it was the people who are alone so much who do all the talking when they get the chance . Yet there you are , doing all the listening ! You are alone here , are n't you ? It would drive me crazy .
NORMAN: That would be a rather extreme eaction , would n't it ?
SAM: Just an expression What I meant was I 'd do just about anything to get away . Would n't you ?
NORMAN: This place ! This is n't ' a place . ' It 's my only world . I grew up in that house back there . I was a happy child . My mother and I we were more than happy .
SAM: And now that your mother 's dead ? Norman snaps a sharp , fast , ugly look at him .
NORMAN: My mother is not dead !
SAM: I did n't think so .
NORMAN: I do n't know what you 've been saying .
SAM: I 've been talking about your mother about your motel . How are you going to do it ?
NORMAN: Do what ?
SAM: Buy a new one ! In a new town ! Where you wo n't have to hide you mother !
NORMAN: Shut up !
SAM: Where will you get the money to do that , Bates or do you already have it socked away a lot of it
NORMAN: Leave me alone !
SAM: Forty thousand dollars !
NORMAN: Leave me alone !
SAM: I bet your mother knows where the money is . And what you did to get it . And I think she 'll tell us .
NORMAN: Where 's that girl ? The girl you came with ! Where is she ?
LILA: Mrs. Bates ? Lila goes into the room .
TELEVISION MAN: You think they 'll take him out that way ?
POLICEMAN: Probably have to . Besides , the taxpayers hate it when something gets slipped out the back door on them !
SAM: It 's regular . Okay ?
LILA: I could stand something regular .
CHAMBERS: You two can go on home if you like . Making that statement was enough fo one night .
SAM: Want to ?
LILA: No . I 'm all right . I 'll feel bette when all this is explained if it can be .
CHAMBERS: If anybody gets any answers , it 'll e the fellow talking to him now the Psychiatrist . Even I could n't each Norman and he knows me . You warm enough , Miss ?
DISTRICT ATTORNEY: Did he talk to you ?
SIMON: No . I got the whole story but not from Norman . I got it from his mother .
LILA: Did he kill my sister ?
SIMON: Yes and no .
DISTRICT ATTORNEY: Look , if you 're trying to lay a lot of psychiatric groundwork for some sort of plea this fellow would like to cop
SIMON: A psychiatrist does n't lay the groundwork .. he merely tries to explain it .
LILA: But my sister is
SIMON: Yes . I 'm sorry . The Private Investigator , too . If you drag that swamp somewhere in the vicinity of the motel Have you any unsolved missing persons cases on your books ?
SAM: Why was he dressed like that ?
DISTRICT ATTORNEY: He 's a transvestite !
SIMON: Not exactly . A man who dresses in woman 's clothing in order to achieve a sexual change or satisfaction is a transvestite . But in Norman 's case , he was simply doing everything possible to keep alive the illusion of his mother being alive . And whenever reality came too close , when danger or desire threatened that illusion , he 'd dress up , even to a cheap wig he brought , and he 'd walk about the house , sit in he chair , speak in her voice He tried to be his mother . And now he is . That 's what I meant when I said I got the story from the mother . She thinks Norman has been taken away ecause of his crimes . She insists she did nothing , that Norman committed all the murders just to keep he from being discovered . She even smiled a bit coquettishly as she said that . Of course , she feels badly about it but also somewhat relieved to e , as she put it , free of Norman , at last . When the mind houses two personalities , there is always a attle . In Norman 's case , the battle is over and the dominant personality has won .
CHAMBERS: And the forty thousand dollars ? Who got that ?
SIMON: The swamp . These were murders of passion , not profit .
POLICE GUARD: He feels a little chill can I ing him this blanket ?
PONTIAC: is parked at the curb . It waits .

DILLINGER: I want to sit here with you and listen to the radio , baby .
BEAT: I have missed you like nobody 's usiness
MCKELLAR: Why do we need this ?
HOOVER: Because of the new breed of mobile outlaws who flee jurisdiction by crossing state lines over highways and against whom this government must wage a war on crime .
MCKELLAR: And so in the middle of a Great Depression you 're looking for a budget increase to build up your Department ? But y my tally your Department of Investigation spends more taxpayer 's dollars catching crooks than what the crooks you catch stole in the first place
HOOVER: That 's ridiculous . The Bureau 's apprehended kidnappers , bank robbers , who have stolen up to
MCKELLAR: How many criminals you apprehended ?
HOOVER: We 've arrested and arraigned 213 wanted felons
MCKELLAR: No . I mean you . How many ?

MCKELLAR: With no field experience . For once Hoover is silent .
CONTINUING: In fact you are shockingly unqualified , are n't you , sir ? You have neve personally conducted a criminal investigation in the field in your life=
HOOVER: Crime is what runs wild in this country , Mr. Chairman . And
MCKELLAR: And if the country required an expanded Bureau , I question you are the person most fit to run it while
EXPLODES: I wo n't be judged by a kangaroo court of venal politicians
MCKELLAR: While outlaws like Dillinger , Clyde Barrow , the Barkers , and Nelson flourish unabated .
SLAM: Your appropriation request is denied . The hearing 's over .
HOOVER: Find out was he soft on the Reds in ,1919 ? Does he use prostitutes ? Peppy ` tuf f like that . And feed this to Walte

ROBERT ESTILL: There 's a law against murder !

CHARLIE: Pretend like nothing 's going on
SURAN: Wait , wait ! Hold it ! Federal Agent !

ALVIN KARPIS: You 're thinking of my partner , Harry Campbell .
HOOVER: Are you relieved its over ? I 'm sure you are .
PAUSE: You know you will feel much better once you get everything off your chest .
ALVIN KARPIS: Who do you think you 're talking to ? Hoover is silent .
SPECIAL AGENT: There 's no handcuffs .
WINSTEAD: Give me your tie .
NEWSMEN: Mr. Hoover ! Director !
HOOVER: Karpis said he 'd never be taken alive , ut I took him without firing a shot .

PURVIS: Yes sir .

BEAT: `` .tell Billie for meBye Bye Blackbird ''
YOUNG MAN: No , forget it , it 's too risky . I 'm through doin ' that shit .
YOUNG WOMAN: You always say that , the same thing every time never again , I 'm through , too dangerous .
YOUNG MAN: I know that 's what I always say . I 'm always right too , but –
YOUNG WOMAN: – but you forget about it in a day or two -
YOUNG MAN: – yeah , well , the days of me forgittin ' are over , and the days of me rememberin ' have just begun .
YOUNG WOMAN: When you go on like this , you know what you sound like ?
YOUNG MAN: I sound like a sensible fucking man , is what I sound like .
YOUNG WOMAN: You sound like a duck . Quack , quack , quack , quack , quack , quack , quack
YOUNG MAN: Well take heart , 'cause you 're neve gon na hafta hear it again . Because since I 'm never gon na do it again , you 're never gon na hafta hear me quack about how I 'm never gon na do it again .
YOUNG WOMAN: After tonight .
YOUNG MAN: Correct . I got all tonight to quack . A WAITRESS comes by with a pot of coffee .
WAITRESS: Can I get anybody anymore coffee ?
YOUNG WOMAN: Oh yes , thank you .
YOUNG MAN: I 'm doin ' fine .
YOUNG WOMAN: Did it work ?
YOUNG MAN: Fuckin ' A it worked , that 's what I 'm talkin ' about ! Knucklehead walks in a bank with a telephone , not a pistol , not a shotgun , but a fuckin ' phone , cleans the place out , and they do n't lift a fuckin ' finger .
YOUNG WOMAN: Did they hurt the little girl ?
YOUNG MAN: I do n't know . There probably neve was a little girl – the point of the story is n't the little girl . The point of the story is they robbed the bank with a telephone .
YOUNG WOMAN: You wan na rob banks ?
YOUNG MAN: I 'm not sayin ' I wan na rob banks , I 'm just illustrating that if we did , it would be easier than what we een doin ' .
YOUNG WOMAN: So you do n't want to be a bank robber ?
YOUNG MAN: Naw , all those guys are goin ' down the same road , either dead or servin ' twenty .
YOUNG WOMAN: And no more liquor stores ?
YOUNG MAN: What have we been talking about ? Yeah , no more-liquor-stores . Besides , it ai n't the giggle it usta be . Too many foreigners own liquor stores . Vietnamese , Koreans , they ca n't fuckin ' speak English . You tell 'em `` Empty out the register , '' and they do n't know what it fuckin ' means . They make it too personal . We keep on , one of those gook motherfuckers ' gon na make us kill 'em .
YOUNG WOMAN: I 'm not gon na kill anybody .
YOUNG MAN: I do n't wan na kill anybody either . But they 'll probably put us in a situation where it 's us of them . And if it 's not the gooks , it these old Jews who 've owned the store fo fifteen fuckin ' generations . Ya got Grandpa Irving sittin ' behind the counter with a fuckin ' Magnum . Try walkin ' into one of those stores with nothin ' but a telephone , see how far it gets you . Fuck it , forget it , we 're out of it .
YOUNG WOMAN: Well , what else is there , day jobs ?
YOUNG MAN: Not this life .
YOUNG WOMAN: Well what then ? He calls to the Waitress .
YOUNG MAN: Garcon ! Coffee ! Then looks to his girl .
WAITRESS: `` Garcon '' means boy . She splits .
YOUNG WOMAN: Here ? It 's a coffee shop .
YOUNG MAN: What 's wrong with that ? People neve ob restaurants , why not ? Bars , liquo stores , gas stations , you get you head blown off stickin ' up one of them . Restaurants , on the other hand , you catch with their pants down . They 're not expecting to get robbed , or not as expecting .
YOUNG WOMAN: I bet in places like this you could cut down on the hero factor .
YOUNG MAN: Correct . Just like banks , these places are insured . The managers do n't give a fuck , they 're just tryin ' to get ya out the door before you start pluggin ' diners . Waitresses , forget it , they ai n't takin ' a bullet fo the register . Busboys , some wetback gettin ' paid a dollar fifty a hou gon na really give a fuck you 're stealin ' from the owner . Customers are sittin ' there with food in thei mouths , they do n't know what 's goin ' on . One minute they 're havin ' a Denve omelet , next minute somebody 's stickin ' a gun in their face .
YOUNG WOMAN: Yeah .
YOUNG MAN: Then you got the idea to take everybody 's wallet .
YOUNG WOMAN: Uh-huh .
YOUNG MAN: That was a good idea .
YOUNG WOMAN: Thanks .
YOUNG MAN: We made more from the wallets then we did the register .
YOUNG WOMAN: Yes we did .
YOUNG MAN: A lot of people go to restaurants .
YOUNG WOMAN: A lot of wallets .
YOUNG MAN: Pretty smart , huh ?
YOUNG WOMAN: Pretty smart . I 'm ready , let 's go , right here , ight now .
YOUNG MAN: Remember , same as before , you 're crowd control , I handle the employees .
YOUNG WOMAN: Got it .
YOUNG MAN: I love you , Honey Bunny .
PUMPKIN: Everybody be cool this is a robbery !
HONEY BUNNY: Any of you fuckin ' pricks move and I 'll execute every one of you motherfuckers ! Got that ?
JULES: – Okay now , tell me about the hash ars ?
VINCENT: What so you want to know ?
JULES: Well , hash is legal there , right ?
VINCENT: Yeah , it 's legal , but is ai n't a hundred percent legal . I mean you ca n't walk into a restaurant , roll a joint , and start puffin ' away . You 're only supposed to smoke in your home or certain designated places .
JULES: Those are hash bars ?
VINCENT: Yeah , it breaks down like this it 's legal to buy it , it 's legal to own it and , if you 're the proprietor of a hash bar , it 's legal to sell it . It 's legal to carry it , which does n't eally matter 'cause – get a load of this – if the cops stop you , it 's illegal for this to search you . Searching you is a right that the cops in Amsterdam do n't have .
JULES: That did it , man – I 'm fuckin ' goin ' , that 's all there is to it .
VINCENT: You 'll dig it the most . But you know what the funniest thing about Europe is ?
JULES: What ?
VINCENT: It 's the little differences . A lotta the same shit we got here , they got there , but there they 're a little different .
JULES: Examples ?
VINCENT: Well , in Amsterdam , you can buy bee in a movie theatre . And I do n't mean in a paper cup either . They give you a glass of beer , like in a bar . In Paris , you can buy beer at MacDonald 's . Also , you know what they call a Quarter Pounder with Cheese in Paris ?
JULES: They do n't call it a Quarter Pounde with Cheese ?
VINCENT: No , they got the metric system there , they would n't know what the fuck a Quarter Pounder is .
JULES: What 'd they call it ?
VINCENT: Royale with Cheese .
JULES: Royale with Cheese . What 'd they call a Big Mac ?
VINCENT: Big Mac 's a Big Mac , but they call it Le Big Mac .
JULES: Le Big Mac . What do they call a Whopper ?
VINCENT: I dunno , I did n't go into a Burge King . But you know what they put on french fries in Holland instead of ketchup ?
JULES: What ?
VINCENT: Mayonnaise .
JULES: Goddamn !
VINCENT: I seen 'em do it . And I do n't mean a little bit on the side of the plate , they fuckin ' drown 'em in it .
JULES: Uuccch !
VINCENT: How many up there ?
JULES: Three or four .
VINCENT: Counting our guy ?
JULES: I 'm not sure .
VINCENT: So there could be five guys up there ?
JULES: It 's possible .
VINCENT: We should have fuckin ' shotguns . They CLOSE the trunk .
JULES: Mia .
VINCENT: How did Marsellus and her meet ?
JULES: I dunno , however people meet people . She usta be an actress .
VINCENT: She ever do anything I woulda saw ?
JULES: I think her biggest deal was she starred in a pilot .
VINCENT: What 's a pilot ?
JULES: Well , you know the shows on TV ?
VINCENT: I do n't watch TV .
JULES: Yes , but you 're aware that there 's an invention called television , and on that invention they show shows ?
VINCENT: Yeah .
JULES: Well , the way they pick the shows on TV is they make one show , and that show 's called a pilot . And they show that one show to the people who pick the shows , and on the strength of that one show , they decide if they want to make more shows . Some get accepted and become TV programs , and some do n't , and become nothing . She starred in one of the ones that became nothing . They enter the apartment building .
VINCENT: Yeah maybe , fat right ?
JULES: I would n't go so far as to call the other fat . He 's got a weight problem . What 's the nigger gon na do , he 's Samoan .
VINCENT: I think I know who you mean , what about him ?
JULES: Well , Marsellus fucked his ass up good . And word around the campfire , it was on account of Marsellus Wallace 's wife . The elevator arrives , the men step inside .
VINCENT: What 'd he do , fuck her ?
JULES: No no no no no no no , nothin ' that ad .
VINCENT: Well what then ?
JULES: He gave her a foot massage .
VINCENT: A foot massage ? Jules nods his head `` Yes . ''
JULES: Sent a couple of guys over to his place . They took him out on the patio of his apartment , threw his ass over the balcony . Nigger fell four stories . They had this garden at the bottom , enclosed in glass , like one of them greenhouses – nigge fell through that . Since then , he 's kinda developed a speech impediment .
VINCENT: That 's a damn shame .
JULES: Whaddya mean ?
VINCENT: You do n't be givin ' Marsellus Wallace 's new bride a foot massage .
JULES: You do n't think he overreacted ?
VINCENT: Antwan probably did n't expect Marsellus to react like he did , but he had to expect a reaction .
JULES: It was a foot massage , a foot massage is nothing , I give my mother a foot massage .
VINCENT: It 's laying hands on Marsellus Wallace 's new wife in a familia way . Is it as bad as eatin ' her out – no , but you 're in the same fuckin ' allpark . Jules stops Vincent .
JULES: Whoa whoa whoa stop right there . Eatin ' a bitch out , and givin ' a bitch a foot massage ai n't even the same fuckin ' thing .
VINCENT: Not the same thing , the same ballpark .
JULES: It ai n't no ballpark either . Look maybe your method of massage differs from mine , but touchin ' his lady 's feet , and stickin ' your tongue in her holyiest of holyies , ai n't the same ballpark , ai n't the same league , ai n't even the same fuckin ' sport . Foot massages do n't mean shit .
VINCENT: Have you ever given a foot massage ?
JULES: Do n't be tellin ' me about foot massages – I 'm the foot fuckin ' master .
VINCENT: Given a lot of 'em ?
JULES: Shit yeah . I got my technique down man , I do n't tickle or nothin ' .
VINCENT: Have you ever given a guy a foot massage ?
JULES: Fuck you .
VINCENT: How many ?
JULES: Fuck you .
VINCENT: Would you give me a foot massage – I 'm kinda tired .
JULES: Man , you best back off , I 'm gittin ' pissed – this is the door .
VINCENT: Seven-twenty-two in the morning .
JULES: It ai n't quite time , let 's hang back .
VINCENT: I 'm not sayin ' he was right , but you 're sayin ' a foot massage do n't mean nothing , and I 'm sayin ' it does . I 've given a million ladies a million foot massages and they all meant somethin ' . We act like they do n't , ut they do . That 's what 's so fuckin ' cool about 'em . This sensual thing 's goin ' on that nobody 's talkin about , ut you know it and she knows it , fuckin ' Marsellus knew it , and Antwan shoulda known fuckin ' better . That 's his fuckin ' wife , man . He ai n't gon na have a sense of humor about that shit .
JULES: That 's an interesting point , but let 's get into character .
VINCENT: What 's her name again ?
JULES: Mia . Why you so interested in big man 's wife ?
VINCENT: Well , Marsellus is leavin ' for Florida and when he 's gone , he wants me to take care of Mia .
JULES: Take care of her ?
VINCENT: Not that ! Take her out . Show her a good time . Do n't let her get lonely .
JULES: You 're gon na be takin ' Mia Wallace out on a date ?
VINCENT: It ai n't a date . It 's like when you and your buddy 's wife go to a movie or somethin ' . It 's just you know good company . Jules just looks at him .
JULES: Hey kids . The two men stroll inside . The three young caught-off-guard Guys are
BRETT: We 're doin ' okay .
JULES: Do you know who we are ? Brett shakes his head `` No . ''
BRETT: I 'm Brett .
JULES: I thought so . Well , you remembe your business partner Marsellus Wallace , dont'ya Brett ?
BRETT: I remember him .
JULES: Good for you . Looks like me and Vincent caught you at breakfast , sorry 'bout that . What'cha eatin ' ?
BRETT: Hamburgers .
JULES: Hamburgers . The cornerstone of any nutritious breakfast . What kinda hamburgers ?
BRETT: Cheeseburgers .
JULES: No , I mean where did you get'em ? MacDonald 's , Wendy 's , Jack-in-the- Box , where ?
BRETT: Big Kahuna Burger .
JULES: Big Kahuna Burger . That 's that Hawaiian burger joint . I heard they got some tasty burgers . I ai n't neve had one myself , how are they ?
BRETT: They 're good .
JULES: Mind if I try one of yours ?
BRETT: No .
JULES: Yours is this one , right ?
BRETT: Yeah . Jules grabs the burger and take a bite of it .
JULES: Uuummmm , that 's a tasty burger . Vince , you ever try a Big Kahuna Burger ?
VINCENT: No . Jules holds out the Big Kahuna .
JULES: You wan na bite , they 're real good .
VINCENT: I ai n't hungry .
JULES: Well , if you like hamburgers give 'em a try sometime . Me , I ca n't usually eat 'em 'cause my girlfriend 's a vegetarian . Which more or less makes me a vegetarian , but I sure love the taste of a good burger . You know what they call a Quarte Pounder with Cheese in France ?
BRETT: No .
JULES: Tell 'em , Vincent .
VINCENT: Royale with Cheese .
JULES: Royale with Cheese , you know why they call it that ?
BRETT: Because of the metric system ?
JULES: Check out the big brain on Brett . You ' a smart motherfucker , that 's ight . The metric system . What 's in this ?
BRETT: Sprite .
JULES: Sprite , good , mind if I have some of your tasty beverage to wash this down with ?
BRETT: Sure . Jules grabs the cup and takes a sip .
JULES: Uuuuummmm , hit 's the spot ! You , Flock of Seagulls , you know what we 're here for ? Roger nods his head `` Yes . ''
MARVIN: It 's under the be –
JULES: – I do n't remember askin ' you a goddamn thing . You were sayin ' ?
ROGER: It 's under the bed .
VINCENT: Got it .
JULES: We happy ? No answer from the transfixed Vincent .
VINCENT: We 're happy .
BRETT: Look , what 's your name ? I got his name 's Vincent , but what 's yours ?
JULES: My name 's Pitt , and you ai n't talkin ' your ass outta this shit .
BRETT: I just want you to know how sorry we are about how fucked up things got etween us and Mr. Wallace . When we entered into this thing , we only had the best intentions –
JULES: Oh , I 'm sorry . Did that break you concentration ? I did n't mean to do that . Please , continue . I believe you were saying something about `` best intentions . '' Brett ca n't say a word .
BRETT: What ?
JULES: `` What '' ai n't no country I know ! Do they speak English in `` What ? ''
BRETT: What ?
JULES: English-motherfucker-can-you-speak- it ?
BRETT: Yes .
JULES: Then you understand what I 'm sayin ' ?
BRETT: Yes .
JULES: Now describe what Marsellus Wallace looks like !
BRETT: What ?
JULES: Say `` What '' again ! C'mon , say `` What '' again ! I dare ya , I double dare ya motherfucker , say `` What '' one more goddamn time ! Brett is regressing on the spot .
BRETT: Well he 's he 's black –
JULES: – go on !
BRETT: and he 's he 's bald –
JULES: – does he look like a bitch ? !
BRETT: What ?
JULES: Does-he-look-like-a-bitch ? !
BRETT: No .
JULES: Then why did you try to fuck 'im like a bitch ? !
BRETT: I did n't . Now in a lower voice .
JULES: Yes ya did Brett . Ya tried ta fuck 'im . You ever read the Bible , Brett ?
BRETT: Yes .
JULES: There 's a passage I got memorized , seems appropriate for this situation Ezekiel 25 17 . `` The path of the ighteous man is beset on all sides y the inequities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men . Blessed is he who , in the name of charity and good will , shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness , for he is truly his brother 's keeper and the finder of lost children . And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who attempt to poison and destroy my others . And you will know my name is the Lord when I lay my vengeance upon you .

TRUDI: You know how they use that gun when they pierce your ears ? They do n't use that when they pierce you nipples , do they ?
JODY: Forget that gun . That gun goes against the entire idea behind piercing . All of my piercing , sixteen places on my ody , every one of 'em done with a needle . Five in each ear . One through the nipple on my left breast . One through my right nostril . One through my left eyebrow . One through my lip . One in my clit . And I wear a stud in my tongue .

MIA: Thanks .
VINCENT: Think nothing of it . He begins rolling one for himself .
MIA: Marsellus said you just got back from Amsterdam .
VINCENT: Sure did . I heard you did a pilot .
MIA: That was my fifteen minutes .
VINCENT: What was it ?
MIA: It was show about a team of female secret agents called `` Fox Force Five . ''
VINCENT: What ?
MIA: `` Fox Force Five . '' Fox , as in we 're a unch of foxy chicks . Force , as in we 're a force to be reckoned with . Five , as in there 's one two three four five of us . There was a blonde one , Sommerset O'Neal from that show `` Baton Rouge , '' she was the leader . A Japanese one , a lack one , a French one and a brunette one , me . We all had special skills . Sommerset had a photographic memory , the Japanese fox was a kung fu master , the black girl was a demolition expert , the French fox ' specialty was sex
VINCENT: What was your specialty ?
MIA: Knives . The character I played , Raven McCoy , her background was she was aised by circus performers . So she grew up doing a knife act . According to the show , she was the deadliest woman in the world with a knife . But ecause she grew up in a circus , she was also something of an acrobat . She could do illusions , she was a trapeze artist – when you 're keeping the world safe from evil , you neve know when being a trapeze artist 's gon na come in handy . And she knew a zillion old jokes her grandfather , an old vaudevillian , taught her . If we woulda got picked up , they woulda worked in a gimmick where every episode I woulda told and ol joke .
VINCENT: Do you remember any of the jokes ?
MIA: Well I only got the chance to say one , 'cause we only did one show .
VINCENT: Tell me .
MIA: No . It 's really corny .
VINCENT: C'mon , do n't be that way .
MIA: No . You wo n't like it and I 'll be embarrassed .
VINCENT: You told it in front of fifty million people and you ca n't tell it to me ? I promise I wo n't laugh .
MIA: That 's what I 'm afraid of .
VINCENT: That 's not what I meant and you know it .
MIA: You 're quite the silver tongue devil , are n't you ?
VINCENT: I meant I would n't laugh at you .
MIA: That 's not what you said Vince . Well now I 'm definitely not gon na tell ya , 'cause it 's been built up too much .
VINCENT: What a gyp .
MIA: Yummy !
VINCENT: Can I have a sip of that ? I 'd like to know what a five-dollar shake tastes like .
MIA: Be my guest . She slides the shake over to him .
VINCENT: Yeah , but maybe I do .
MIA: Kooties I can handle . He takes a sip .
VINCENT: Goddamn ! That 's a pretty fuckin ' good milk shake .
MIA: Told ya .
VINCENT: I do n't know if it 's worth five dollars , but it 's pretty fuckin ' good . He slides the shake back .
MIA: Do n't you hate that ?
VINCENT: What ?
MIA: Uncomfortable silences . Why do we feel it 's necessary to yak about ullshit in order to be comfortable ?
VINCENT: I do n't know .
MIA: That 's when you know you found somebody special . When you can just shit the fuck up for a minute , and comfortably share silence .
VINCENT: I do n't think we 're there yet . But do n't feel bad , we just met each other .
MIA: Well I 'll tell you what , I 'll go to the bathroom and powder my nose , while you sit here and think of something to say .
VINCENT: I 'll do that .
MIA: I said goddamn !
VINCENT: We 're lucky we got it at all . Buddy Holly does n't seem to be much of a waiter . We shoulda sat in Marilyn Monroe 's section .
MIA: Which one , there 's two Marilyn Monroes .
VINCENT: No there 's not .
MIA: Pretty smart .
VINCENT: I have moments .
MIA: Did ya think of something to say ?
VINCENT: Actually , there 's something I 've wanted to ask you about , but you seem like a nice person , and I did n't want to offend you .
MIA: Oooohhhh , this does n't sound like mindless , boring , getting-to-know- you chit-chat . This sounds like you actually have something to say .
VINCENT: Only if you promise not to get offended .
MIA: You ca n't promise something like that . I have no idea what you 're gon na ask . You could ask me what you 're gon na ask me , and my natural esponse could be to be offended . Then , through no fault of my own , I woulda broken my promise .
VINCENT: Then let 's just forget it .
MIA: That is an impossibility . Trying to forget anything as intriguing as this would be an exercise in futility .
VINCENT: Is that a fact ? Mia nods her head `` Yes . ''
MIA: Besides , it 's more exciting when you do n't have permission .
VINCENT: What do you think about what happened to Antwan ?
MIA: Who 's Antwan ?
VINCENT: Tony Rocky Horror .
MIA: He fell out of a window .
VINCENT: That 's one way to say it . Anothe way is , he was thrown out . Anothe was is , he was thrown out by Marsellus . And even another way is , he was thrown out of a window by Marsellus because of you .
MIA: Is that a fact ?
VINCENT: No it 's not , it 's just what I heard .
MIA: Who told you this ?
VINCENT: They . Mia and Vincent smile .
MIA: They talk a lot , do n't they ?
VINCENT: They certainly do .
MIA: Well do n't by shy Vincent , what exactly did they say ? Vincent is slow to answer .
VINCENT: No . They just said Rocky Horror gave you a foot massage .
MIA: And ?
VINCENT: No and , that 's it .
MIA: You heard Marsellus threw Rocky Horro out of a four-story window because he massaged my feet ?
VINCENT: Yeah .
MIA: And you believed that ?
VINCENT: At the time I was told , it seemed easonable .
MIA: Marsellus throwing Tony out of a four story window for giving me a foot massage seemed reasonable ?
VINCENT: No , it seemed excessive . But that does n't mean it did n't happen . I heard Marsellus is very protective of you .
MIA: A husband being protective of his wife is one thing . A husband almost killing another man for touching his wife 's feet is something else .
VINCENT: But did it happen ?
MIA: The only thing Antwan ever touched of mine was my hand , when he shook it . I met Anwan once – at my wedding – then never again . The truth is , nobody knows why Marsellus tossed Tony Rocky Horror out of that window except Marsellus and Tony Rocky Horror . But when you scamps get together , you 're worse than a sewing circle .
ED SULLIVAN: Ladies and gentlemen , now the moment you 've all been waiting for , the worldfamous Jackrabbit Slim 's twist contest . Patrons cheer .
MIA: Right here . Vincent reacts .
VINCENT: No , no , no no , no , no , no , no .
MIA: No , no , no , no , no , no , no . I do elieve Marsellus , my husband , you oss , told you to take me out and do whatever I wanted , Now , I want to dance . I want to win . I want that trophy .
VINCENT: All right .
MIA: So , dance good .
VINCENT: All right , you asked for it .
ED SULLIVAN: Let 's hear it for our first contestants . Patrons cheer . Vincent and Mia walk up to the microphone .
MIA: Missus Mia Wallace .
ED SULLIVAN: And , uh , how 'bout your fella here ?
MIA: Vincent Vega .
ED SULLIVAN: All right , let 's see what you can do . Take it away !
VINCENT: Was than an uncomfortable silence ?
MIA: I do n't know what that was . Music and drinks !
VINCENT: I 'm gon na take a piss .
MIA: That was a little bit more information than I needed to know , but go right ahead . Vincent shuffles off to the john .
VINCENT: One drink and leave . Do n't be rude , ut drink your drink quickly , say goodbye , walk out the door , get in your car , and go down the road .
VINCENT: It 's a moral test of yourself , whether or not you can maintain loyalty . Because when people are loyal to each other , that 's very meaningful .
VINCENT: So you 're gon na go out there , drink your drink , say `` Goodnight , I 've had a very lovely evening , '' go home , and jack off . And that 's all you 're gon na do .
VINCENT: Jesus Christ !
LANCE: I can hear it !

VINCENT: Well then get it .

JODY: I never saw a medical book .
LANCE: Trust me , I have one .
JODY: Well if it 's that important , why did n't you keep it with the shot ? Lance spins toward her .
LANCE: I do n't know ! Stop bothering me !
JODY: While you 're lookin ' for it , that girl 's gon na die on our carpet . You 're never gon na find it in all this shit . For six months now , I 've been telling you to clean this room –
VINCENT: Quit fuckin ' around man and give he the shot !
LANCE: While I 'm doing this , take her shirt off and find her heart . Vince rips her blouse open .

LANCE: Yeah , it has to be exact ! I 'm giving her an injection in the heart , so I got ta exactly hit her in the heart .
VINCENT: Well , I do n't know exactly where he heart is , I think it 's here .

JODY: Got it .
VINCENT: Okay , what do I do ?
LANCE: Well , you 're giving her an injection of adrenaline straight to her heart . But she 's got a breast plate in front of her heart , so you got ta pierce through that . So what you got ta do is bring the needle down in a stabbing motion .
VINCENT: I got ta stab her ?
LANCE: If you want the needle to pierce through to her heart , you got ta sta her hard . Then once you do , push down on the plunger .
VINCENT: What happens after that ?
LANCE: I 'm curious about that myself .
VINCENT: This ai n't a fuckin ' joke man !
LANCE: She 's supposed to come out of it like – – that .
VINCENT: Count to three .
LANCE: One RED DOT on Mia 's body . Needle raised ready to strike .
MIA: Something .
JODY: Anybody want a beer ?
VINCENT: What are your thoughts on how to handle this ?
MIA: What 's yours ?
VINCENT: Well I 'm of the opinion that Marsellus can live his whole live and neve ever hear of this incident . Mia smiles .
MIA: Do n't worry about it . If Marsellus ever heard of this , I 'd be in as much trouble as you .
VINCENT: I seriously doubt that .
MIA: If you can keep a secret , so can I .
VINCENT: Let 's shake on it .
MIA: You still wan na hear my `` FOX FORCE FIVE '' joke ? Vincent turns around .
VINCENT: Sure , but I think I 'm still a little too petrified to laugh .
MIA: Uh-huh . You wo n't laugh because it 's not funny . But if you still wan na hear it , I 'll tell it .
VINCENT: I ca n't wait .
MIA: Three tomatoes are walking down the street , a poppa tomato , a momma tomato , and a little baby tomato . The baby tomato is lagging behind the poppa and momma tomato . The poppa tomato gets mad , goes over to the momma tomato and stamps on him – – and says catch up . They both smile , but neither laugh .
MOTHER: Butch , stop watching TV a second . We got a special visitor . Now do you emember when I told you your daddy dies in a P.O.W . camp ?
CAPT. KOONS: Hello , little man . Boy I sure heard a bunch about you . See , I was a good friend of your Daddy 's . We were in that Hanoi pit of hell over five years together . Hopefully , you 'll never have to experience this yourself , but when two men are in a situation like me and your Daddy were , for as long as we were , you take on certain responsibilities of the other . If it had been me who had not made it , Major Coolidge would be talkin ' right now to my son Jim . But the way it worked out is I 'm talkin ' to you , Butch . I got somethin ' fo ya .
KLONDIKE: It 's time , Butch .
BUTCH: I 'm ready .
ESMARELDA: Are you the man I was supposed to pick up ?
BUTCH: If you 're the cab I called , I 'm the guy you 're supposed to pick up .
ESMARELDA: Where to ?
BUTCH: Outta here .
VINCENT: Mia . How you doin ' ?
MIA: Great . I never thanked you for the dinner .
ENGLISH DAVE: He booked .
BUTCH: Hey , how do I open the window back here ?
ESMARELDA: I have to do it .
BUTCH: What ?
ESMARELDA: You were in that fight ? The fight on the radio – you 're the fighter ? As he tosses his other glove out the window .
BUTCH: Whatever gave you that idea ?
ESMARELDA: No c'mon , you 're him , I know you 're him , tell me you 're him .
BUTCH: I 'm him .
ESMARELDA: You killed the other boxing man .
BUTCH: He 's dead ?
ESMARELDA: The radio said he was dead . He finished wiping himself down .
BUTCH: Sorry 'bout that , Floyd . He tosses the towel out the window .
ESMARELDA: What does it feel like ?
BUTCH: What does what feel like ?
ESMARELDA: Killing a man . Beating another man to death with your bare hands . Butch pulls on his tee-shirt .
BUTCH: Are you some kinda weirdo ?
ESMARELDA: No , it 's a subject I have much interest in . You are the first person I ever met who has killed somebody . So , what was it like to kill a man ?
BUTCH: Tell ya what , you give me one of them cigarettes , I 'll give you an answer .
ESMARELDA: Deal !
BUTCH: So He looks at her license .
ESMARELDA: The name is Spanish , but I 'm Columbian .
BUTCH: It 's a very pretty name .
ESMARELDA: It mean `` Esmarelda of the wolves . ''
BUTCH: That 's one hell of a name you got there , sister .
ESMARELDA: Thank you . And what is your name ?
BUTCH: Butch .
ESMARELDA: Butch . What does it mean ?
BUTCH: I 'm an American , our names do n't mean shit . Anyway , moving right along , what is it you wan na know , Esmarelda ?
ESMARELDA: I want to know what it feels like to kill a man –
BUTCH: – I could n't tell ya . I did n't know he was dead 'til you told me he was dead . Now I know he 's dead , do you wan na know how I feel about it ? Esmarelda nods her head `` yes . ''
PAUSE: Eight ? How long to collect ? So by tomorrow evening , you 'll have it all ? Good news Scotty , real good news – I understand a few stragglers aside . Me an ' Fabienne 're gon na leave in the morning . It should take us a couple days to get into Knoxville . Next time we see each other , it 'll e on Tennessee time .
BUTCH: Fabienne my love , our adventure egins .
ESMARELDA: Forty-five sixty . Handing her the money .
BUTCH: Merci beaucoup . And here 's a little something for the effort . Butch holds up a hundred dollar bill .
ESMARELDA: The truth . Three well-dressed , slightly toasted , Mexicans . He gives her the bill .
BUTCH: Bon soir , Esmarelda .
ESMARELDA: Sleep well , Butch .
FABIENNE: Keep the light off .
BUTCH: Is that better , sugar pop ?
FABIENNE: Oui . Hard day at the office ?
BUTCH: Pretty hard . I got into a fight .
FABIENNE: Poor baby . Can we make spoons ?
BUTCH: Uh-huh ?
FABIENNE: I wish I had a pot .
BUTCH: You were lookin ' in the mirror and you wish you had some pot ?
FABIENNE: A pot . A pot belly . Pot bellies are sexy .
BUTCH: Well you should be happy , 'cause you do .
FABIENNE: Shut up , Fatso ! I do n't have a pot ! I have a bit of a tummy , like Madonna when she did `` Lucky Star , '' it 's not the same thing .
BUTCH: I did n't realize there was a difference between a tummy and a pot elly .
FABIENNE: The difference is huge .
BUTCH: You want me to have a pot ?
FABIENNE: No . Pot bellies make a man look eithe oafish , or like a gorilla . But on a woman , a pot belly is very sexy . The est of you is normal . Normal face , normal legs , normal hips , normal ass , but with a big , perfectly round pot belly . If I had one , I 'd wear a tee-shirt two sizes too small to accentuate it .
BUTCH: You think guys would find that attractive ?
FABIENNE: I do n't give a damn what men find attractive . It 's unfortunate what we find pleasing to the touch and pleasing to the eye is seldom the same .
BUTCH: If you a pot belly , I 'd punch you in it .
FABIENNE: You 'd punch me in my belly ?
BUTCH: Right in the belly .
FABIENNE: I 'd smother you . I 'd drop it on you ight on your face 'til you could n't eathe .
BUTCH: You 'd do that to me ?
FABIENNE: Yes !
BUTCH: Did you get everything , sugar pop ?
FABIENNE: Yes , I did .
BUTCH: Good job .
FABIENNE: Did everything go as planned ?
BUTCH: You did n't listen to the radio ?
FABIENNE: I never listen to your fights . Were you the winner ?
BUTCH: I won alright .
FABIENNE: Are you still retiring ?
BUTCH: Sure am .
FABIENNE: What about the man you fought ?
BUTCH: Floyd retired too .
FABIENNE: Really ? ! He wo n't be fighting no more ? !
BUTCH: Not no more .
FABIENNE: So it all worked out in the finish ?
BUTCH: We ai n't at the finish , baby .
FABIENNE: We 're in a lot of danger , are n't we ? Butch nods his head `` yes . ''
BUTCH: Fabienne , I want you to be with me .
FABIENNE: Forever ?
BUTCH: and ever . Fabienne lies her head back . Butch continues to massage her crotch .
FABIENNE: Do you love me ?
BUTCH: Oui .
FABIENNE: Butch ? Will you give me oral pleasure ? Butch kisses her on the mouth .
BUTCH: Will you kiss it ? She nods her head `` yes . ''
FABIENNE: But you first .
BUTCH: I think I cracked a rib .
FABIENNE: Giving me oral pleasure ?
BUTCH: No retard , from the fight .
FABIENNE: Do n't call me retard .
BUTCH: My name is Fabby ! My name is Fabby !
FABIENNE: Shut up fuck head ! I hate that Mongoloid voice .
BUTCH: Okay , sorry , sorry , sorry , I take it ack ! Can I have a towel please , Miss Beautiful Tulip .
FABIENNE: Oh I like that , I like being called a tulip . Tulip is much better than Mongoloid .
BUTCH: I did n't call you a Mongoloid , I called you a retard , but I took it ack . She hands him a towel .
FABIENNE: Butch ?
BUTCH: Yes , lemon pie .
FABIENNE: Where are we going to go ?
BUTCH: I 'm not sure yet . Wherever you want . We 're gon na get a lot of money from this . But it ai n't gon na be so much , we can live like hogs in the fat house forever . I was thinking we could go somewhere in the South Pacific . The kinda money we 'll have 'll carry us a long way down there .
FABIENNE: So if we wanted , we could live in Bora Bora ?
BUTCH: You betcha . And if after awhile you do n't dig Bora Bora , then we can move over to Tahiti or Mexico .
FABIENNE: But I do not speak Spanish .
BUTCH: You do n't speak Bora Boran either . Besides , Mexican is easy Donde esta el zapataria ?
FABIENNE: What does that mean ?
BUTCH: Where 's the shoe store ?
FABIENNE: Donde esta el zapataria ?
BUTCH: Excellent pronunciation . You 'll be my little mama ceta in no time .
FABIENNE: Que hora es ?
BUTCH: What are you watching ?
FABIENNE: A motorcycle movie , I 'm not sure the name .
BUTCH: Are you watchin ' it ? Fabienne enters the room .
FABIENNE: In a way . Why ? Would you like for me to switch it off ?
BUTCH: Would you please ? She reaches over and turns off the TV .
FABIENNE: What was it about ?
BUTCH: How should I know , you were the one watchin ' it . Fabienne laughs .
FABIENNE: No , imbecile , what was your dream about ?
BUTCH: Oh , I do n't remember . It 's really are I remember a dream .
FABIENNE: You just woke up from it .
BUTCH: Fabienne , I 'm not lying to you , I do n't remember .
FABIENNE: Well , let 's look at the grumpy man in the morning . I did n't say you were lying , it 's just odd you do n't emember your dreams . I always emember mine . Did you know you talk in your sleep ?
BUTCH: I do n't talk in my sleep , do I talk in my sleep ?
FABIENNE: You did last night .
BUTCH: What did I say ? Laying on top of him .
FABIENNE: I do n't know . I could n't understand you . She kisses Butch .
BUTCH: One more kiss and I 'll get up . Fabienne gives Butch a sweet long kiss .
FABIENNE: Satisfied ?
BUTCH: Yep .
FABIENNE: Then get up , lazy bones .
BUTCH: What time is it ?
FABIENNE: Almost nine in the morning . What time does our train arrive ?
BUTCH: Eleven .
FABIENNE: I 'm gon na order a big plate of lueberry pancakes with maple syrup , eggs over easy , and five sausages .
BUTCH: Anything to drink with that ? Butch is finished dressing .
FABIENNE: Oh yes , that looks nice . To drink , a tall glass or orange juice and a lack cup of coffee . After that , I 'm going to have a slice of pie . As he goes through the suitcase .
BUTCH: Pie for breakfast ?
FABIENNE: Any time of the day is a good time for pie . Blueberry pie to go with the pancakes . And on top , a thin slice of melted cheese –
BUTCH: – where 's my watch ?
FABIENNE: It 's there .
BUTCH: No , it 's not . It 's not here .
FABIENNE: Have you looked ?
BUTCH: Yes I 've fuckin ' looked ! ! He 's now throwing clothes .
FABIENNE: Uhhh yes beside the table drawe
BUTCH: – on the little kangaroo .
FABIENNE: Yes , it was on your little kangaroo .
BUTCH: Well it 's not here !
FABIENNE: Well it should be !
BUTCH: Oh it most definitely should be here , ut it 's not . So where is it ? Fabienne is crying and scared .
FABIENNE: I believe so
BUTCH: You believe so ? You either did , o you did n't , now which one is it ?
FABIENNE: Then I did .
BUTCH: Are you sure ?
FABIENNE: No . Butch freaks out , he punches the air .
BUTCH: No ! It 's not your fault . You left it at the apartment .
FABIENNE: I 'm sorry . Butch puts on his high school jacket .
BUTCH: Do n't be . It just means I wo n't be able to eat breakfast with you .
FABIENNE: Why does it mean that ?
BUTCH: Because I 'm going back to my apartment to get my watch .
FABIENNE: Wo n't the gangsters be looking fo you there ?
BUTCH: That 's what I 'm gon na find out . If they are , and I do n't think I can handle it , I 'll split . Rising from the floor .
FABIENNE: I was so dreadful . I saw your watch , I thought I brought it . I 'm so sorry .
BUTCH: Do n't feel bad , sugar pop . Nothing you could ever do would make me permanently angry at you . I love you , remember ? Now here 's some money , order those pancakes and have a great breakfast .
FABIENNE: Do n't go .
BUTCH: I 'll be back before you can say , lueberry pie .
FABIENNE: Blueberry pie .
BUTCH: Well maybe not that fast , but fast . Okay ? Okay ?
FABIENNE: Okay .
BUTCH: Bye-bye , sugar pop .
FABIENNE: Bye .
BUTCH: I 'm gon na take your Honda .
FABIENNE: Okay . And with that , he 's out the door .
BUTCH: Of all the fuckin ' things she coulda forgot , she forgets my father 's watch . I specifically reminded her not to forget it . `` Bedside table – on the kangaroo . '' I said the words `` Do n't forget my father 's watch . ''
PEDESTRIAN: Jesus , are you okay ? Butch look at him , spaced-out .
BUTCH: I guess .
GAWKER #1: He 's dead ! He 's dead ! This jerk 's yelling makes Marsellus come to .
GAWKER #2: If you need a witness in court , I 'll e glad to help . He was a drunken maniac . He hit you and crashed into that car .
MARSELLUS: Who ?
GAWKER #2: Him .
MARSELLUS: Well , I 'll be damned .

VINCENT: Why the fuck did n't you tell us about that guy in the bathroom ? Slip you mind ? Forget he was in there with a goddamn hand cannon ?
JULES: We should be fuckin ' dead right now . Did you see that gun he fired at us ? It was bigger than him .
VINCENT: .357 .
JULES: We should be fuckin ' dead !
VINCENT: Yeah , we were lucky . Jules rises , moving toward Vincent .
JULES: That shit was n't luck . That shit was somethin ' else . Vincent prepares to leave .
VINCENT: Yeah , maybe .
JULES: That was divine intervention . You know what divine intervention is ?
VINCENT: Yeah , I think so . That means God came down from Heaven and stopped the bullets .
JULES: Yeah , man , that 's what is means . That 's exactly what it means ! God came down from Heaven and stopped the bullets .
VINCENT: I think we should be going now .
JULES: Do n't do that ! Do n't you fuckin ' do that ! Do n't blow this shit off ! What just happened was a fuckin ' miracle !
VINCENT: Chill the fuck out , Jules , this shit happens .
JULES: Wrong , wrong , this shit does n't just happen .
VINCENT: Do you wan na continue this theological discussion in the car , or at the jailhouse with the cops ?
JULES: We should be fuckin ' dead now , my friend ! We just witnessed a miracle , and I want you to fuckin ' acknowledge it !
VINCENT: Okay man , it was a miracle , can we leave now ?
JULES: If you wan na play blind man , then go walk with a Shepherd . But me , my eyes are wide fuckin ' open .
VINCENT: What the fuck does that mean ?
JULES: That 's it for me . For here on in , you can consider my ass retired .
VINCENT: Jesus Christ !
JULES: Do n't blaspheme !
VINCENT: Goddammit , Jules –
JULES: – I said do n't do that –
VINCENT: – you 're fuckin ' freakin ' out !
JULES: I 'm tellin ' Marsellus today I 'm through .
VINCENT: While you 're at it , be sure to tell 'im why .
JULES: Do n't worry , I will .
VINCENT: I 'll bet ya ten thousand dollars , he laughs his ass off .
JULES: I do n't give a damn if he does .
VINCENT: Marvin , what do you make of all this ?
MARVIN: I do n't even have an opinion .
VINCENT: C'mon , Marvin . Do you think God came down from Heaven and stopped the ullets ? Vincent 's .45 goes BANG !
JULES: What the fuck 's happening ?
VINCENT: I just accidentally shot Marvin in the throat .
JULES: Why the fuck did you do that ?
VINCENT: I did n't mean to do it . I said it was an accident .
JULES: I 've seen a lot of crazy-ass shit in my time –
VINCENT: – chill out , man , it was an accident , okay ? You hit a bump or somethin ' and the gun went off .
JULES: The car did n't hit no motherfuckin ' ump !
VINCENT: Look ! I did n't mean to shoot this son-ofa-bitch , the gun just went off , do n't ask me how !
JULES: Look at this mess ! We 're drivin ' around on a city street in broad daylight –
VINCENT: – I know , I know , I was n't thinkin ' about the splatter .
JULES: Well you better be thinkin ' about it now , motherfucker ! We got ta get this car off the road . Cops tend to notice shit like you 're driving a ca drenched in fuckin ' blood .
VINCENT: Ca n't we just take it to a friendly place ?
JULES: This is the Valley , Vincent . Marsellus do n't got no friendly places in the Valley .
VINCENT: Well , do n't look at me , this is you town , Jules .
JULES: A buddy of mine in Toluca Lake .
VINCENT: Where 's Toluca Lake .
JULES: On the other side of the hill , by Burbank Studios . If Jimmie 's ass ai n't home , I do n't know what the fuck we 're gon na go . I ai n't got any other partners in 818 . Jimmie ! How you doin ' man , it 's Jules . Listen up man , me an ' my homeboy are in some serious shit . We 're in a ca we got ta get off the road , pronto ! I need to use your garage for a couple hours .
VINCENT: If he kicks us out , whadda we do ?
JULES: Well , we ai n't leavin ' 'til we made a couple phone calls . But I neve want it to reach that pitch . Jimmie 's my friend and you do n't bust in you friend 's house and start tellin ' 'im what 's what .
VINCENT: Just tell 'im not to be abusive . He kinda freaked out back there when he saw Marvin .
JULES: Put yourself in his position . It 's eight o'clock in the morning . He just woke up , he was n't prepared fo this shit . Do n't forget who 's doin ' who a favor .
VINCENT: If the price of that favor is I got ta take shit , he can stick his favo straight up his ass .
JULES: What the fuck did you just do to his towel ?
VINCENT: I was just dryin ' my hands .
JULES: You 're supposed to wash 'em first .
VINCENT: You watched me wash 'em .
JULES: I watched you get 'em wet .
VINCENT: I washed 'em . Blood 's real hard to get off . Maybe if he had some Lava , I coulda done a better job .
JULES: I used the same soap you did and when I dried my hands , the towel did n't look like a fuckin ' Maxie pad . Look , fuck it , alright . Who cares ? But it 's shit like this that 's gon na bring this situation to a boil . If he were to come in here and see that towel like that I 'm tellin ' you Vincent , you best be cool . 'Cause if I got ta get in to it with Jimmie on account of you Look , I ai n't threatenin ' you , I respect you an ' all , just do n't put me in that position .
JIMMIE: Knock it off , Julie .
JULES: What ?
JIMMIE: I 'm not a cobb or corn , so you can stop butterin ' me up . I do n't need you to tell me how good my coffee is . I 'm the one who buys it , I know how fuckin ' good it is . When Bonnie goes shoppin ; , she buys shit . I buy the gourmet expensive stuff 'cause when I drink it , I wan na taste it . But what 's on my mind at this moment is n't the coffee in my kitchen , it 's the dead nigger in my garage .
JULES: Jimmie –
JIMMIE: – I 'm talkin ' . Now let me ask you a question , Jules . When you drove in here , did you notice a sign out front that said , `` Dead nigger storage ? '' Jules starts to `` Jimmie '' him –
JULES: Naw man , I did n't .
JIMMIE: You know why you did n't see that sign ?
JULES: Why ?
JIMMIE: 'Cause storin ' dead niggers ai n't my fuckin ' business ! Jules starts to `` Jimmie '' him .
JULES: Jimmie –
JIMMIE: – do n't fuckin ' Jimmie me , man , I ca n't be Jimmied . There 's nothin ' you can say that 's gon na make me forget I love my wife . Now she 's workin ' the graveyard shift at the hospital . She 'll be comin ' home in less than an hour and a half . Make your phone calls , talk to your people , than get the fuck out of my house .
JULES: That 's all we want . We do n't wan na fuck up your shit . We just need to call our people to bring us in .
JIMMIE: Then I suggest you get to it . Phone 's in my bedroom .
MARSELLUS: well , say she comes home . Whaddya think she 'll do ? No fuckin ' shit she 'll freak . That ai n't no kinda answer . You know 'er , I do n't . How bad , a lot or a little ?
JULES: You got to appreciate what an explosive element this Bonnie situation is . If she comes home from a hard day 's work and finds a bunch of gangsters doin ' a bunch of gangsta ' shit in her kitchen , ai n't no tellin ' what she 's apt to do .
MARSELLUS: I 've grasped that , Jules . All I 'm doin ' is contemplating the `` ifs . ''
JULES: I do n't wan na hear about no motherfuckin ' `` ifs . `` What I wan na hear from your ass is `` you ai n't got no problems , Jules . I 'm on the motherfucker . Go back in there , chill them niggers out and wait for the cavalry , which should be comin ' directly . ''
MARSELLUS: You ai n't got no problems , Jules . I 'm on the motherfucker . Go back in there , chill them niggers out and wait for The Wolf , who should be comin ' directly .
JULES: You sendin ' The Wolf ?
MARSELLUS: Feel better ?
JULES: Shit Negro , that 's all you had to say .
THE WOLF: Is she the hysterical type ? When she due ? Give me the principals ' names again ? Jules We SEE his book . The page has written on it
JIMMIE: Yeah .
THE WOLF: I 'm Winston Wolf , I solve problems .
JIMMIE: Good , 'cause we got one .
THE WOLF: So I heard . May I come in ?
JIMMIE: Please do .
THE WOLF: You must be Jules , which would make you Vincent . Let 's get down to brass tacks , gentlemen . If I was informed correctly , the clock is ticking , is that right , Jimmie ?
JIMMIE: 100 % .
THE WOLF: Your wife , Bonnie comes home at 9 30 in the AM , is that correct ?
JIMMIE: Uh-huh .
THE WOLF: I was led to believe if she comes home and finds us here , she would n't appreciate it none too much .
JIMMIE: She wo n't at that .
THE WOLF: That gives us forty minutes to get the fuck outta Dodge , which , if you do what I say when I say it , should y plenty . Now you got a corpse in a car , minus a head , in a garage . Take me to it .
JIMMIE: Yes .
THE WOLF: Do me a favor , will ya ? Thought I smelled some coffee in there . Would you make me a cup ?
JIMMIE: Sure , how do you take it ?
THE WOLF: Lotsa cream , lotsa sugar .
JULES: Aside from how it looks , the car 's cool .
THE WOLF: Positive ? Do n't get me out on the oad and I find out the brake lights do n't work .
JULES: Hey man , as far as I know , the motherfucker 's tip-top .
THE WOLF: Good enough , let 's go back to the kitchen .
JIMMIE: Yeah . Exactly . Under the sink .
THE WOLF: Good . What I need you two fellas to do is take those cleaning products and clean the inside of the car . And I 'm talkin ' fast , fast , fast . You need to go in the backseat , scoop up all those little pieces of brain and skull . Get it out of there . Wipe down the upholstery – now when it comes to upholstery , it do n't need to be spic and span , you do n't need to eat off it . Give it a good once over . What you need to take care of are the really messy parts . The pools of blood that have collected , you got ta soak that shit up . But the windows are a different story . Them you really clean . Get the Windex , do a good job . Now Jimmie , we need to aid your linen closet . I need lankets , I need comforters , I need quilts , I need bedspreads . The thicke the better , the darker the better . No whites , ca n't use 'em . We need to camouflage the interior of the car . We 're gon na line the front seat and the backseat and the floor boards with quilts and blankets . If a cop stops us and starts stickin ' his big snout in the car , the subterfuge wo n't last . But at a glance , the ca will appear to be normal . Jimmie – lead the way , boys – get to work .
VINCENT: A `` please '' would be nice . The Wolf stops and turns around .
THE WOLF: Come again ?
VINCENT: I said a `` please '' would be nice . The Wolf takes a step toward him .
THE WOLF: Set is straight , Buster . I 'm not here to say `` please . `` I 'm here to tell you want to do . And if self- preservation is an instinct you possess , you better fuckin ' do it and do it quick . I 'm here to help . If my help 's not appreciated , lotsa luck gentlemen .
JULES: It ai n't that way , Mr. Wolf . You help is definitely appreciated .
VINCENT: I do n't mean any disrespect . I just do n't like people barkin ' orders at me .
THE WOLF: If I 'm curt with you , it 's because time is a factor . I think fast , I talk fast , and I need you guys to act fast if you want to get out of this . So pretty please , with suga on top , clean the fuckin ' car .
JIMMIE: Mr. Wolf , you got ta understand somethin ' –
THE WOLF: – Winston , Jimmie – please , Winston .
JIMMIE: You got ta understand something , Winston . I want to help you guys out and all , but that 's my best linen . It was a wedding present from my Uncle Conrad and Aunt Ginny , and they ai n't with us anymore –
THE WOLF: – let me ask you a question , if you do n't mind ?
JIMMIE: Sure .
THE WOLF: Were you Uncle Conrad and Aunt Ginny millionaires ?
JIMMIE: No .
THE WOLF: Well , your Uncle Marsellus is . And I 'm positive if Uncle Conrad and Aunt Ginny were millionaires , they would 've furnished you with a whole edroom set , which your Uncle Marsellus is more than happy to do . I like oak myself , that 's what 's in my bedroom . How 'bout you Jimmie , you an oak man ?
JIMMIE: Oak 's nice .
JULES: I will never forgive your ass fo this shit . This is some fucked-up epugnant shit !
VINCENT: Did you ever hear the philosophy that once a man admits he 's wrong , he 's immediately forgiven for all wrong-doings ?
JULES: Man , get outta my face with that shit ! The motherfucker who said that never had to pick up itty-bitty pieces of skull with his fingers on account of your dumb ass .
VINCENT: I got a threshold , Jules . I got a threshold for the abuse I 'll take . And you 're crossin ' it . I 'm a race car and you got me in the red . Redline 7000 , that 's where you are . Just know , it 's fuckin ' dangerous to be drivin ' a race car when it 's in the ed . It could blow .
JULES: You 're gettin ' ready to blow ? I 'm a mushroom-cloud-layin ' motherfucker ! Every time my fingers touch brain I 'm `` SUPERFLY T.N.T , '' I 'm the `` GUNS OF NAVARONE . '' I 'm what Jimmie Walke usta talk about . In fact , what the fuck am I doin ' in the back ? You 're the motherfucker should be on brain detail . We 're tradin ' . I 'm washin ' windows and you 're pickin ' up this nigger 's skull .
THE WOLF: Fine job , gentlemen . We may get out of this yet .
JIMMIE: I ca n't believe that 's the same car .
THE WOLF: Well , let 's not start suckin ' each other 's dicks quite yet . Phase one is complete , clean the car , which moves us right along to phase two , clean you two .
VINCENT: All the way ?
THE WOLF: To your bare ass .
JULES: This morning air is some chilly shit .
VINCENT: Are you sure this is absolutely necessary ?
THE WOLF: You know what you two look like ?
VINCENT: What ?
THE WOLF: Like a couple of guys who just blew off somebody 's head . Yes , strippin ' off those bloody rags is absolutely necessary . Toss the clothes in Jim 's garbage bag .
JULES: Now Jimmie , do n't do nothin ' stupid like puttin ' that out in front of your house for Elmo the garbage man to take away .
THE WOLF: Do n't worry , we 're takin ' it with us . Jim , the soap . He hands the now-naked men a bar of soap .
JULES: Goddamn , that water 's fuckin ' cold !
THE WOLF: Better you than me , gentlemen . The two men , trembling , scrub themselves .
JIMMIE: Dorks . They look like a couple of dorks . The Wolf and Jimmie laugh .
JULES: Ha ha ha . They 're your clothes , motherfucker .
JIMMIE: I guess you just got ta know how to wear them .
JULES: Yeah , well , our asses ai n't the expert on wearin ' dorky shit that your is .
THE WOLF: C'mon , gentlemen , we 're laughin ' and jokin ' our way into prison . Do n't make me beg .
TO JULES: What did I say ?
JULES: Do n't do shit unless –
THE WOLF: – unless what ?
JULES: Unless you do it first .
THE WOLF: Spoken like a true prodigy . How 'bout you , Lash Larue ? Can you keep your spurs from jingling and jangling ?
VINCENT: I 'm cool , Mr. Wolf . My gun just went off , I dunno how .
THE WOLF: Fair enough . I drive real fuckin ' fast , so keep up . If I get my car back any different than I gave it , Monster Joe 's gon na e disposing of two bodies .
JULES: We cool ?
WINSTON: Like it never happened . Jules and Vincent bump fists .
RAQUEL: Hi . You know , if they ever do `` I SPY THE MOTION PICTURE , '' you guys , I 'd be great . What 's with the outfits . You guys going to a volleyball game ? Winston laughs , the boys groan .
WINSTON: I 'm takin ' m'lady out to breakfast . Maybe I can drop you two off . Where do you live ?
VINCENT: Redondo Beach .
JULES: Inglewood .
WINSTON: It 's your future I see a ca ide . Sorry guys , move out of the sticks . Say goodbye , Raquel .
RAQUEL: Goodbye , Raquel .
WINSTON: I 'll see you two around , and stay outta trouble , you crazy kids . Winston turns to leave .
JULES: Mr. Wolf . He turns around .
WINSTON: Call me Winston .
RAQUEL: I have character .
WINSTON: Just because you are a characte does n't mean you have character .
RAQUEL: Oh you 're so funny , oh you 're so funny . The Porsche SHOOTS OFF down the road . The two men left alone look at each other .
JULES: Wan na share a cab ?
VINCENT: You know I could go for some eakfast . Want to have breakfast with me ?
JULES: Sure .
VINCENT: Thanks a bunch . Want a sausage ?
JULES: Naw , I do n't eat pork .
VINCENT: Are you Jewish ?
JULES: I ai n't Jewish man , I just do n't dig on swine .
VINCENT: Why not ?
JULES: They 're filthy animals . I do n't eat filthy animals .
VINCENT: Sausages taste good . Pork chops taste good .
JULES: A sewer rat may taste like pumpkin pie . I 'll never know 'cause even if it did , I would n't eat the filthy motherfucker . Pigs sleep and root in shit . That 's a filthy animal . I do n't wan na eat nothin ' that ai n't got enough sense to disregard its own feces .
VINCENT: How about dogs ? Dogs eat their own feces .
JULES: I do n't eat dog either .
VINCENT: Yes , but do you consider a dog to be a filthy animal ?
JULES: I would n't go so far as to call a dog filthy , but they 're definitely dirty . But a dog 's got personality . And personality goes a long way .
VINCENT: So by that rationale , if a pig had a etter personality , he 's cease to be a filthy animal ?
JULES: We 'd have to be talkin ' 'bout one motherfuckin ' charmin ' pig . It 'd have to be the Cary Grant of pigs . The two men laugh .
VINCENT: Good for you . Lighten up a little . You been sittin ' there all quiet .
JULES: I just been sittin ' here thinkin ' .
VINCENT: About what ?
JULES: The miracle we witnessed .
VINCENT: The miracle you witnessed . I witnessed a freak occurrence .
JULES: Do you know that a miracle is ?
VINCENT: An act of God .
JULES: What 's an act of God ?
VINCENT: I guess it 's when God makes the impossible possible . And I 'm sorry Jules , but I do n't think what happened this morning qualifies .
JULES: Do n't you see , Vince , that shit do n't matter . You 're judging this thing the wrong way . It 's not about what . It could be God stopped the bullets , he changed Coke into Pepsi , he found my fuckin ' car keys . You do n't judge shit like this based on merit . Whethe or not what we experienced was an according-to-Hoyle miracle is insignificant . What is significant is I felt God 's touch , God got involved .
VINCENT: But why ?
JULES: That 's what 's fuckin ' wit ' me ! I do n't know why . But I ca n't go back to sleep .
VINCENT: So you 're serious , you 're really gon na quit ?
JULES: The life , most definitely .
PATRON: Garcon ! Coffee !
VINCENT: So if you 're quitting the life , what 'll you do ?
JULES: That 's what I 've been sitting here contemplating . First , I 'm gon na deliver this case to Marsellus . Then , asically , I 'm gon na walk the earth .
VINCENT: What do you mean , walk the earth ?
JULES: You know , like Caine in `` KUNG FU . '' Just walk from town to town , meet people , get in adventures .
VINCENT: How long do you intend to walk the earth ?
JULES: Until God puts me where he want me to be .
VINCENT: What if he never does ?
JULES: If it takes forever , I 'll wait forever .
VINCENT: So you decided to be a bum ?
JULES: I 'll just be Jules , Vincent – no more , no less .
VINCENT: No Jules , you 're gon na be like those pieces of shit out there who beg fo change . They walk around like a bunch of fuckin ' zombies , they sleep in garbage bins , they eat what I throw away , and dogs piss on 'em . They got a word for 'em , they 're called bums . And without a job , residence , o legal tender , that 's what you 're gon na be – a fuckin ' bum !
JULES: Look my friend , this is just where me and you differ –
VINCENT: – what happened was peculiar – no doubt about it – but it was n't wate into wine .
JULES: All shapes and sizes , Vince .
VINCENT: Stop fuckin ' talkin ' like that !
JULES: If you find my answers frightening , Vincent , you should cease askin ' scary questions .
VINCENT: I got ta take a shit . To be continued . Vincent exits for the restroom .
PUMPKIN: Everybody be cool , this is a robbery !
HONEY BUNNY: Any of you fuckin ' pricks move and I 'll execute every one of you motherfuckers ! Got that ? !
PUMPKIN: Customers stay seated , waitresses on the floor .
HONEY BUNNY: Now mean fuckin ' now ! Do it or die , do it or fucking die !
PUMPKIN: You Mexicans in the kitchen , get out here ! Asta luego !
MANAGER: I 'm the manager here , there 's no problem , no problem at all – Pumpkin heads his way .
PUMPKIN: You 're gon na give me a problem ?
MANAGER: No , I 'm not . I 'm not gon na give you any problem !
PUMPKIN: I do n't know , Honey Bunny . He looks like the hero type to me !
HONEY BUNNY: Do n't take any chances . Execute him !
MANAGER: Please do n't ! I 'm not a hero . I 'm just a coffee shop manager . Take anything you want .
PUMPKIN: Tell everyone to cooperate and it 'll e all over .
MANAGER: Everybody just be calm and cooperate with them and this will be all ove soon !
PUMPKIN: Well done , now git your fuckin ' ass on the ground .
JULES: My boss ' dirty laundry .
PUMPKIN: You boss makes you do his laundry ?
JULES: When he wants it clean .
PUMPKIN: Sounds like a shit job .
JULES: Funny , I 've been thinkin ' the same thing .
PUMPKIN: Open it up .
JULES: 'Fraid I ca n't do that .
PUMPKIN: I did n't hear you .
JULES: Yes , you did .
HONEY BUNNY: What 's goin ' on ?
PUMPKIN: Looks like we got a vigilante in ou midst .
HONEY BUNNY: Shoot 'em in the face !
JULES: I do n't mean to shatter your ego , ut this ai n't the first time I 've had gun pointed at me .
PUMPKIN: You do n't open up that case , it 's gon na be the last .
MANAGER: Quit causing problems , you 'll get us all killed ! Give 'em what you got and get 'em out of here .
JULES: Keep your fuckin ' mouth closed , fat man , this ai n't any of your goddamn usiness !
PUMPKIN: I 'm countin ' to three , and if you hand ai n't off that case , I 'm gon na unload right in your fuckin ' face . Clear ? One
JULES: You win . Jules raises his hand off the briefcase .
PUMPKIN: Open it .
HONEY BUNNY: What is it ? What is it ?
PUMPKIN: Is that what I think it is ? Jules nods his head `` yes . ''
HONEY BUNNY: Goddammit , what is it ?
JULES: Tell that bitch to be cool ! Say , itch be cool ! Say , bitch be cool !
PUMPKIN: Chill out , honey !
HONEY BUNNY: Let him go !
JULES: Tell her it 's gon na be okay .
PUMPKIN: I 'm gon na be okay .
JULES: Promise her .
PUMPKIN: I promise .
JULES: Tell her to chill .
PUMPKIN: Just chill out .
JULES: What 's her name ?
PUMPKIN: Yolanda .
JULES: So , we cool Yolanda ? We ai n't gon na do anything stupid , are we ?
YOLANDA: Do n't you hurt him .
JULES: Nobody 's gon na hurt anybody . We 're gon na be like three Fonzies . And what ' Fonzie like ? No answer .
YOLANDA: He 's cool ?
JULES: Correct-amundo ! And that 's what we 're gon na be , we 're gon na be cool . Now Ringo , I 'm gon na count to three and I want you to let go your gun and lay your palms flat on the table . But when you do it , do it cool . Ready ? Pumpkin looks at him .
YOLANDA: Okay , now let him go !
JULES: Yolanda , I thought you were gon na be cool . When you yell at me , it makes me nervous . When I get nervous , I get scared . And when motherfuckers get scared , that 's when motherfuckers get accidentally shot .
YOLANDA: Just know you hurt him , you die .
JULES: That seems to be the situation . Now I do n't want that and you do n't want that and Ringo here do n't want that . So let 's see what we can do . Now this is the situation . Normally oth of your asses would be dead as fuckin ' fried chicken . But you happened to pull this shit while I 'm in a transitional period . I do n't wan na kill ya , I want to help ya . But I 'm afraid I ca n't give you the case . It do n't belong to me . Besides , I went through too much shit this morning on account of this case to just hand it over to your ass .
PUMPKIN: It 's cool , Honey Bunny , we 're still cool .
VINCENT: What the hell 's goin ' on , Jules ?
JULES: Nothin ' I ca n't handle . I want you to just hang back and do n't do shit unless it 's absolutely necessary .
VINCENT: Check .
JULES: Yolanda , how we doin , baby ?
YOLANDA: I got ta go pee ! I want to go home .
JULES: Just hang in there , baby , you 're doing ' great , Ringo 's proud of you and so am I . It 's almost over . Now I want you to go in that bag and find my wallet .
PUMPKIN: Which one is it ?
JULES: It 's the one that says Bad Motherfucker on it .
PUMPKIN: About fifteen hundred dollars .
JULES: Put it in your pocket , it 's yours . Now with the rest of them wallets and the register , that makes this a pretty successful little score .
VINCENT: Jules , if you give this nimrod fifteen hundred buck , I 'm gon na shoot 'em on general principle .
JULES: You ai n't gon na do a goddamn thing , now hang back and shut the fuck up . Besides , I ai n't givin ' it to him . I 'm buyin ' somethin ' for my money . Wan na know what I 'm buyin ' Ringo ?
PUMPKIN: What ?
JULES: Your life . I 'm givin ' you that money so I do n't hafta kill your ass . You ead the Bible ?
PUMPKIN: Not regularly .
JULES: There 's a passage I got memorized . Ezekiel 25 17 . `` The path of the ighteous man is beset on all sides y the inequities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men . Blessed is he who , in the name of charity and good will , shepherds the weak through the valley of the darkness . For he is truly his brother 's keeper and the finder of lost children . And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who attempt to poison and destroy my others . And you will know I am the Lord when I lay my vengeance upon you . '' I been sayin ' that shit fo years . And if you ever heard it , it meant your ass . I never really questioned what it meant . I thought it was just a coldblooded thing to say to a motherfucker 'fore you popped a cap in his ass . But I saw some shit this mornin ' made me think twice . Now I 'm thinkin ' , it could mean you 're the evil man . And I 'm the righteous man . And Mr. .45 here , he 's the shepherd protecting my righteous ass in the valley of darkness . Or is could by you 're the righteous man and I 'm the shepherd and it 's the world that 's evil and selfish . I 'd like that . But that shit ai n't the truth . The truth is you 're the weak . And I 'm the tyranny of evil men . But I 'm tryin ' . I 'm tryin ' real hard to e a shepherd . Jules lowers his gun , lying it on the table .
VINCENT: I think we oughta leave now .
JULES: That 's probably a good idea .
BARRY: yes I 'm still on hold
OPERATOR: And what was this ?
BARRY: I 'm looking at your advertisement for the airline promotion and giveaway ?
OPERATOR: This is `` Fly With Us ? ''
BARRY: It 's hard to understand because it says in addition to but I ca n't exactly understand in addition to what because there 's actually nothing to add it too
OPERATOR: I think that 's a type-o then , that would be a mistake .
BARRY: So , just to clarify , I 'm sorry Ten purchases of any of your Healthy Choice products equals five hundred miles and then with the coupon the same purchases would value one thousand miles

LENA: I thought I should tell you . I did n't want to get too far along on going out and be hiding something BEAT . He leans slightly back in FRAME .
BARRY: That 's very nice . Thank you . Thank you for saying that . You 're friends with my sister ?
LENA: Yeah .
BARRY: How long have you known her ?
LENA: About six months .
BARRY: You like her ?
LENA: Yeah . Yeah we get along well . You did n't get along with her very well ?
BARRY: Did you really come to meet me on purpose or are you lying about that ?
LENA: No , no . I did .
BARRY: That 's nice . It 's nice . I 've been looking around a lot lately at promotional giveaways , cross promotional work by some companies . Do you remember all that pudding ?
LENA: Yeah .
BARRY: So that pudding was bought , I ought that pudding because of a pretty interesting promotion that 's sponsored by Healthy Choice and American Airlines . It 's designed to encourage airline travel and obviously designed to encourage uying Healthy Choice products . They make frozen meals , deli meats , pasta sauce , breads , soups and ice creams , this sort of thing..
LENA: Yeah ?
BARRY: .I 'm sorry.I lost my thoughts , what I was saying .
LENA: You were talking about the promotion
BARRY: the promotion says buy any 10 Healthy Choice products and get 500 miles of airline travel or 1,000 for purchases made with a special coupon . So in the supermarket , you notice their products , first you notice they have a Teriyaki Chicken Dinner at $ 1.79 - that 's a pretty good deal.but then I noticed they had soup at 89 cents a can..and you start to do the math and you start to notice that it 's a really amazing deal because I stumbled across the pudding at 25 cents a cup . Now the crucial thing is the bar codes on the label . That 's those little bar codes , you know ? The universal product codes ?
LENA: Yeah .
BARRY: That 's what 's used to redeem the mileage , so in noticing the pudding , each cup had an individual ar code in other words Two dollars and fifty cents for ten cups of pudding is 500 miles . Add in the coupon it 's one thousand . You see ?
LENA: Yeah .
BARRY: You see ?
LENA: Yeah , no , I see
BARRY: You see if you spent $ 3,000 dollars on pudding you could earn over one million frequent flyer miles .
LENA: That 's insane . That is really , eally crazy . That 's just crazy if you spend three thousand dollars on pudding .
BARRY: .yeah .
LENA: So that was your pudding ?
BARRY: .No .
LENA: I 'm sorry . I thought you said
BARRY: No I did n't say that .
LENA: I thought you said you bought all that pudding
BARRY: My friend Carlos is doing it who works with me . It 's his . It 's his pudding , he 's doing it . It 's not mine . He 's crazy . I told him not to do it . He 's the one who 's insane . He only spent about one hundred dollars so far though
LENA: Your sister was telling me a pretty funny story about you , when you guys were kids and you were uilding a ramp for your dog and you threw a hammer through a window ? Is that right ? You threw a hamme through a sliding glass door ?
BARRY: I do n't remember that , she might be lying . I have to go the bathroom . He gets up and goes .

The door crashes against her instep , she winces in pain but Chick does n't notice . He 's already upon the OFFENDERS , heaving them against the wall . Vanity streaks inside , blazes up the stairway , ducks behind a GROUP of
JILL: What are you retarded o something ? ! Why do n't you look where you 're going ? She 's 18 years old , blonde and pretty in a cute , innocent way . A Daisy Mae-type whose emotions form so quickly , she has trouble sorting them out . Right now she 's mad as hell she thinks
VANITY: Sorry where 's the office ? Jill squats , picks up the broken glasses-
JILL: Do you think you can just come in here and take over ?
VANITY: I said I 'm sorry what do you want me to do ? Where 's the office ? Jill points Vanity hurries away

JILL: Do you have any experience ? Vanity simmers , enunciates every word
VANITY: Yeahdefinitely .
JILL: Follow me . And she turns on her heels , makes he way through the club , moving into the vicinity of the stage . Vanity follows her reluctantly , casts a look to the and . She spots Prince for the first time stops instantly His effect on her is instantaneous . Passion surges through her like a tidal wave . His hair , face , eyes it all conspires to make her weak . It 's like meeting someone for the first time , but seeing so much of yourself in them , that their lips , eyes , mouth you 're certain you have touched , and the desire to be with them becomes so strong that the very act of touching will release you in a way you never thought possible Prince brines `` Let 's Get Crazy '' to a ousing , blistering end . Suddenly the stage is plunged into darkness . The CROWD goes WILD ! Vanity snaps out of it . Jill is tugging at her arm , a puzzled look on her face
VANITY: I do n't have a phone . When will he be back ?
JILL: Wellyou can try tomorrow .

MC: Ladies and gentlemen please welcome The Time .
CLUB: Sudden APPLAUSE and CRIES . Vanity and Jill turn directly into the path of Prince , descending the Steps of the stage . Vanity gasps , LOCKS eyes with him . Jill seems to jump out of her skin it 's obvious she has a crush on him something awful
JILL: Hi ya , Prince God I liked that song , it 's real fun . She fidgets uncontrollably , Vanity 's card buring a hole into her hand . Prince glances at the card , then stares at Vanity , the ripeness of her look paralyzing . He tears his eyes away , puts on his sunglesses , looks toward the stage .
VANITY: I really liked your song too But he 's gone . Her eyes scan the room frantically catches a glimpse of him leaving . She takes a sudden step , then stops , paralyzed with indecision . Jill egards ger coldly . MORRIS meanwhile is beside himself . Some gorgeous , dark-haired babe , eyes wide as saucers was starlng at him from the bar . Prince has left , and this girl is his . He motions to Jerome , and they direct their act in her direction . JILL gazes at Vanity , fidgets intensely , suspicious and resentful of her . She glances up and notices Morris , look . She seizes upon an idea , forces a friendly smile , taps Vanity on the shoulder
JILL: Hey She points to the stage . Vanity looks at Morris , and he goes crazy , entertaining her with his own special lend of showmanship . The CROWD loves it ! Vanity is held a moment , but he thouchts are elsewhere . She finally comes to a decision , pulls away , cuts through the club .
VANITY: Hey wait ! But Prince is too far away , the traffic too coneested for him to hear . He whips down the street , disappears around the corner . Vanity continues running , then slows , dejection overcoming her in waves . She looks around KIDS are staring at her , passing jokes . Embarrassed , She moves to the front door but Chick is there , his eyes upon her cold , impassionate . Exhausted and slighlty tearlul , she cuts across the street , heads back to he apartment .
FATHER: You do what I say , do you hea me ? ! You 've got to keep this place clean ! You here , no place else !
MOTHER: You 're crazy !
PRINCE: Please , Dadshe 's heard you . She 's had enough ! His Mother drags herself up along the wall
MOTHER: He 's trying to kill me ! He 's crazy ! Look what he 's doing to me !
PRINCE: Dad , please she 's WHACK ! Prince 's head snaps back , his feet lift from the floor , his body CRASHES in a heap by the door Stunned SILENCE . Prince , flat on his ack , fights vertigo with everything he 's got . His Mother lets out a YELP , ushes into the bedroom , SLAMS the door . His Father stands motionless , sullen
FATHER: Get upyou ai n't hurt . Prince opens his Mouth , BLOOD gushes from a gash in his tongue . He hoists himself up slowly , using the wall fo support . He moves into the kitchen , disappears down the basement steps .
PRINCE: What are you doing here ? She 's a bundle of loose , embarrassing ends the cigarette , hat , juice
JILL: Whatwhat are you doing here ? He feels caught out SCANS the BOARD earnestly for Vanity 's info tries to think of something to say
PRINCE: Huh it 's kind of dead in here . Where is everybody ?

PRINCE: That 's nice Ah , I guess I 'll come back at a better time . You think tonight the the place 'll be jumping ?
JILL: Well , I 'll be here I always like what you do . He smiles , moves to the door Jill connects with a thought
PRINCE: What ? A subpoena ?
JILL: No She rumages through her bag , pulls out a cassette
PRINCE: Why did n't they give it to me themselves ?
JILL: Well , I liked it and wanted to listen to it . They told me to give it to you when I was done . He puts his sunglasses on , hesitates , then takes it from her gingerly . He egards it for a long time

JEROME: What ? ? The Shoeshine Boy looks up slowly egards them with a soulfull look
SHOESHINE BOY: Either of you do heavy drugs ?
PRINCE: There on your boot . She looks down it 's the expensive gold chain . She hesitates , then hands it to him . He drops it into his pocket , walks away
VANITY: Hey , wait ! She runs after him
PRINCE: You can have it back later .
VANITY: I want it back now , okay ?
PRINCE: Who gave it to you ?
VANITY: A person
PRINCE: Female or male ?
VANITY: Huh
PRINCE: You 're lying . I can tell just y your reaction that you 're lying . He moves away briskly Vanity stands her ground , amused
VANITY: You see something you like ? He puts on his sunglasses . A GUITAR stands prominently in the window .
PRINCE: Let 's go for a ride . He flips her the gold chain ' turns hastily . She weighs it in her hand , studies the guitar
VANITY: It 's pretty .
VANITY: My psychic told rne I was going to be famous .
PRINCE: How much did that cost you ?
VANITY: Fifty bucks . It was a good investment . He does n't respond she suddenly feels shy
PRINCE: Oh , yeah what did you play ?
VANITY: Isadora Duncan She stretches her arms like a butterfly , does a little step
PRINCE: Nope .
VANITY: Pardon me ?
PRINCE: Nope . She 's Perplexed
VANITY: Nope .
PRINCE: Because you would n't pass the initiation .
VANITY: What initiation ?
PRINCE: Well , for starters ycu have to purify yourself in the waters of Lake Minnetonka .
VANITY: What ?
PRINCE: You have to purify yourself in Lake Minnetonka . Her brow furrows , she looks out across the lake . He 's calmly throwing stones . Recognizing a challenge when she sees one , she formulates a plan , faces him seductively , shoots him an open look . He stops suddenly , locks eyes with her , feels his knees go weak . Her hold on him is unmistakable . She pulls off he louse in one fluid motion , tugs off he oots , drops her pants to the ground . She 's exquisite , takes a step toward him . Passion rings in his veins Suddenly she turns on her heels , moves purposefully toward the water . He 's shocked , realizes that she 's about to go in
VANITY: We made a deal ! And before he can react she scampers along a log , DIVES beneath the surface . He ca n't believe it her spirit really impresses him . She breaks the surface coughing and sputtering , hops and jumps to the shore
PRINCE: Hold it .
VANITY: What ?
PRINCE: That ai n't Lake Minnetonka . He tries to keep a straight face , jumps on his motorcvcle , STARTS it up . His words take a moment to sink in , then
VANITY: You bastard . I do n't believe it . How could you do that to me ? ! She gathers up her clothes , tries desperately to put them on . She slips and falls Prince ca n't help laughing-
VANITY: Bastard ! He laughs heartily , wants to kid her , ides down the road as if he 's leaving . Having his fun , he slows , turns to go ack his smile dissolves instantly . Vanity is in the middleof the road , flagging down a small PICKUP TRUCK . She hops in , slams the door . The truck peels out , bears down upon him . He gesticulates his arms wildly wants to explain
PRINCE: Hey But the truck streaks past Vanity 's look is cold , triumphant .
KIM: Honey , you still chasing afte that fool ? Kim is 21 years and gorgeous , with dark eyes , a smooth sculpted face , and taut shapely legs . She is street-educated and does n't need encouraging to speak her mind . Katy is also in her-early 20 's , a tall , alluring Oriental , with an attractive , intelligent face
JILL: I 'm doing what I 'm doing . It 's my business .
KATY: He does n't even look at you . That 's the last thing you want from a man .
JILL: You just do n't know him like I do .
KIM: Honey Look , Listen , and then Feel . If you do them in any other order , you 're headed for trouble . Matt and Bobby stroll up
BOBBY: Hey , Jill where 's ou drinks ?
JILL: They 're coming just wait . Matt stares hungrily at her breasts
BOBBY: Jill , in ten years they 'll be on the table . She swats him with her order pad Bobby ducks , taunts her

MATT: Sweetheart do you have a eal hot place where I could stick my nose ?
KIM: Sure try a microwave . The Guys bust up , head for their tables-
KATY: Those guys are deep .

VANITY: I 'm paying see ? Keep the change . Chick advances on her her eyes widen with fear
CHICK: The manager wants to see you .
VANITY: Really.. ? Oh , greatlike to see him too . She breaths a sigh of relief . JEROME watches as Chick escorts Vanity to the upper level . He stays short distance behind .
CHICK: He 'll be right with you . Chick walks away . Jerome makes a move toward her , but pulls himself up short - - BILLY SPARKS has approached her

PRINCE: Let 's ride .
AERIAL SHOT: Prince and Vanity on his motorcycle whipping down the highway . The DAWN LIGHT breaks over the horizon .

PRINCE: Yes . He takes the flower , slips it into his jacket , kisses her forehead .
ANOTHER ANGLE: RAIN patters srtongly against the barn . A deep THUNDER rolls . She 's on top of him , moving deliciously , her body glowing in the purple , dawn light .

FATHER: I could make you happy . Just elieve in me
MOTHER: You never
FATHER: I would die for you . He leaves the room , closes the doo ehind him . PRINCE stares at the door a moment , tears welling in his eyes . His Mothe is motionless , whimpering softly .

MOTHER: It 's nice here . It 's a nice house . Nothing wrong . It 's a good family . Believe me , I know . Nothing wrong here . Your father is okay . He 's a good man . You could learn somthing . She catches a glimpse of herself in the mirror , stops
VANITY: I missed you ! Missed you ! Missed you ! She hugs him tight , showers him with kisses , topples them both to the bed . Laughing , hugging , kissing fast and furious . Suddenly she jumps up like a panther , fluffs her hair wildly in the mirror , fixes him with a wanton look . His eyes devour her
PRINCE: Come here . Where were you ? She moistens her lips , walks lasciviously toward the bed , sits facing him . She laughs suddenly , pushes him ackand they 're at each other again - - faces two inches apart ; touching , whispering , kissing , hands searching shutting out the rocm , shutting out the world She jumps up suddenly . She ca n't be contained ! She practically levitates
VANITY: I have a big surprise for you . She rushes to the coal chute , climbs halfway through . Prince , puzzled , cracks up watching her ass and legs dangling . She drops back into the room , holding a large PACKAGE . His eyes widen . She struts to the bed , lays it down majestically before him
PRINCE: What is it ?
VANITY: Open it . He starts peeling the tape off , careful not to rip the paper . Vanity 's bursting with excitement though , and demolishes it in a flash ! He laughs , opens the lid stares in shock
PRINCE: Oh , no Oh , no ! He pulls out a gleaming new GUITAR , and we immediately recognize it as the one they saw in the window . He 's deliriously happy , and speechless
VANITY: I love it ! She twists around , kneels beside him , showers him with bites and kisses . Suddenly she stops
PRINCE: What ? She backs away from him , stands , strikes a defensive stance
VANITY: I 'm going to join Morris ' group . He LUNGES savagely before he knows it ! His hand lashes out , SMASHES her in the face . She falls back , CRASHES into the mirror . She slips dully to the floor , tries desperately to brace herself on a chair He 's horrified

PRINCE: Where 's Lisa and Wendy ?
BOBBY: They have n't shown up yet .
PRINCE: They call ? The Guys shrug , look away . Prince simmers a moment , straps on his guitar - - immediately gets ear-splitting FEEDBACK . He stomps on the floor pedals angrily . Just then Chick comes up to the stage

VANITY: Leave me alone ! I 've got a show to do ! She pulls away savagely
MORRIS: Man why do n't you just do the walk ? Prince glares at him , cups his genitals-
PRINCE: Why do n't you kiss the one- eyed snake ? The Band lets out a condescending GROAN the tension rises
MORRIS: Jellybean ! Jellybean , 6 ' 4 '' , 210 pounds , steps from ehind the drums , moves up behind Prince-
JELLYBEAN: Let 's go , Jack .
PRINCE: Fuck you ! He lunges , grabs Vanity again she
VANITY: Leave me alone , dammit ! Get out of here ! Jellybean lurches , grabs Prince in a HEAIDLOCK , lifts him off his his feet . Prince kicks at him wildly
JELLYBEAN: Fucker ! ! He twists Prince 's head backwards , SMASHES his body to the ground
VANITY: Jellybean , please
JELLYBEAN: Lift him .
VANITY: Do n't hurt him They pick him up , move him toward the door . He resists them slightly , his ody lurching in fit and starts . Suddenly he breaks free , faces them with his back to he door . But the Band Members surround him , their wills united , the obviousness of the situation apparent to all . He searches for Vanity 's eyes , but she ca n't face him and walks away . Ange again surges in his veins . He cuts out the door , SLAMS it behind him .
PRINCE: Ma ? She turns , he gasps out loud . Her left eye is swollen shut
MOTHER: Hi , ya , baby Her drunken breath washes over him his head spins
PRINCE: Mawhat happened ? She rubs up against him
MOTHER: Can you give me some money ? C'mon , just some money She gropes for him drunkenly he suddenly realizes she does n't know who he is
PRINCE: C'monI 'll take you home . Just then a COP moves through the Crowd-
COP: Okay , c'mon now break it up . Let 's go.. The Crowd moves out . Police RADIOS cackle . Three WOMEN stagger over , one of them grabbing his Mother
WOMAN: C'mon , honey we 're goin ' in She fixes Prince with a glare
PRINCE: Where the fuck are you ? He spins like a top , streaks down the hallway , throws open several doors violently
FATHER: 'Course it 's mine . Who else 's is it goin ' to be ? Got all kinds of them . They 're different too .
PRINCE: I 'd like to see them . You got them written down somewhere ?
FATHER: No , man I do n't write them down do n't need to . That 's the big difference between you and me .
PRINCE: Thought you were n't going to play no more . His Father looks at him sullenly , then looks down , stares at the keys . Prince 's eyes well with tears
FATHER: You gon na get married ?
PRINCE: I do n't know . His Father shares a hurtful look with him , then stares darkly at the floo elow
FATHER: Never get married .
VANITY: What are we doing here , Morris ?
MORRIS: What do you mean ?
VANITY: I do n't want to be here . I do n't want to hurt anybody .
MORRIS: It 's not about hurting anybody . This is business . We can use the exposure . Just then Brenda and Susan come up to the car excitedly . Brenda is dressed in a 40's-style dress , Susan wears a form- fitting leopard one . They both look gorgeous
BRENDA: Hi you coming in ? Their excitement and nervousness is endearing . Vanity 's heart goes out to them . She forces a smile , climbs out unaided
VANITY: Your horns are showing , Morris .
MORRIS: Yeahbut they 're holding up my halo .
BAR AREA: as Billy Sparks shakes hands with Morris and Jerome and is introduced to Vanity Six for the first time . We can tell by his reaction that he likes what he sees . He kisses Brenda and Susan , saves a special squeeze for Vanity herself . He escorts the whole group to a table across the floor . Vanity brings up the ear , casts a quick look to Prince onstage .
PRINCE: fastens on her and brings `` Compute Blue '' to a rousing end . The Crowd applauds , but it 's more out of respect than eagerness . He does n't seem to notice though , or care . He confers quickly with his group. , then moves center-stage . The Band Members trade frustrated looks with each other it 's obvious that they have some trouble with the next song Prince presses his lips to the mike , and the MUSIC starts . He begins SINGING `` Darling Nicky ''
BILLY SPARKS: shoots a fierce look to Prince , helps Morris , Jerome and the Girls to thei table . Vanity is watching Prince , a puzzled look on her face
MORRIS: Hee , heelittle empty tonight , huh , Billy . But I guess money is n't everything . Jerome busts up
JEROME: Oh no that 's cold But Billy agrees
BILLY: The Duke of Dick is in rare form tonight . They all look toward the stage
PRINCE: is fastened on Vanity and it 's apparent to all . He launches into the next verse-
VANITY: flushes with embarrassment . Billy and Morris notice this and glare at Prince .
PRINCE: looks dead-center at them , and then to Vanily
VANITY: stands suddenly , fighting back tears . She backs from the table quickly , knocks the chair over . Morris tries to help her , but she sweeps past him , hurrying for the exit .
CHICK: Hey But she pulls away , runs out the door , cuts across the street .
PRINCE: brings the SONG to a blistering end . The stage is plunged into darkness . He strips off his guitar , cuts from the stage , ignoring the grave looks from his Band Members .
BILLY: What the fuck 's wrong with you , Prince ? !
PRINCE: I do n't have time for you ullshit , Billy . What do you want ?
BILLY: My stage is no place for you personal shit !
PRINCE: That 's life , man .
BILLY: Life my ass , motherfucker ! This is a business , and you 're not too far gone to see that . I 've told you this before . You 're not pulling them in like you used to . The only person who gives a fuck about your music is yourself .
PRINCE: Fuck off ! But Billy ca n't help laughing
BILLY: Just like your old man Prince shoots him a threatening look
PRINCE: Lay off that ! Billy turns to go
BILLY: Take your head out of you ass , Prince , check it out unless you like the view up there . Your music does n't make sense to anyone but yourself . He closes the door behind him . Prince stands dully a moment , then sits heavily in a chair . Exhaustion suddenly overwhelms him . He rests his head in his hands , moments tick by He shakes himself awake Morris and Jerome stand by the door
JEROME: That was fucked up what you did man . Morris does n't like it . And being a part of this - - I do n't like it either .
PRINCE: I do n't care .
MORRIS: Hee , heehuh , it 's obvious you do n't have what it takes to be on top . He pulls an envelope from his pocket
JEROME'S POV: Billy Sparks and his Girlfriend being seated at a front table . A COMEDIAN is on stage juggling KNIVES and HATCHETS . The CROWD is ROARING their approval .
MORRIS: cuts from the dressing room , closes the door behind him . He joins Jerome at the curtain , and they move down the back stairway to the CLUB
JEROME: I guess so , M.D .
MORRIS: I think I 'm going to be sick . Why does this have to be happening to me ? Has it crossed your mind that we 're about to make the biggest mistake we 've ever made ?
JEROME: I do n't think it 's all that ad .
MORRIS: That 's why I do all the thinking .
PRINCE: stands in the back , his eyes glued to Vanity . Her strength and sureness in front of the Crowd is breathtaking . The audience loves her and he suddenly feels very alone as if another wall has gone up between them . He looks away a moment and spots Morris looking at him with a self- satisfied , triumphant grin on his face . Prince looks away , moves out of his eyesight . `` Sex Shooter '' comes to an end . The stage is plunged into darkness . The CROWD goes WILD , leaps to their feet , egging for more . The Girls , slighly over-whelmed by the response and flushing deep red , hold one another.tightly and take repeated bows .
VANITY: and the Girls rush into the dressing oom and jump up and down with excitement . They are beside themselves with happiness , kissing and hugging one another avidly . Suddenly Vanity pulls away , indicates she will be back and cuts out the room .
HALLWAY: as she runs down the hallway to the ackstage area , peers from behind the curtain , scanning the club earnestly .
BILLY: Morris is squeezing you , kiddo . You better kick ass tomorrow night or else . He cuts outside , disappears into the Crowd . Prince stands there steaming , the wind knocked out of him , his joy a memory . He turns back to the line , but it has grown , the Crowd now jammed up against the door . Frustrated , he cuts outside .
BACKSTAGE: as Vanity watches Prince leave . A profound sadness sweeps her face . Suddenly Susan is by her Side , hugging and kissing her happily . Brenda runs up , pouring champagne . Morris , Jerome and The Time are at the end of the hallway and beckon her excitedly into the room . Vanity forces a smile , goes down the hallway , casting another look at the exit door .
VANITY: Did you hear these people applauding ? They loved us they wanted to rip us apart , and this is just our first night . I can see it now , we 're all going to be big stars . I can feel it .
MORRIS: Ai n't nobody bad like me . She kisses him spontaneously on the cheek
VANITY: Morris , you 're a genius .
MORRIS: Ye-es He fixes her with a sexy look , takes a healthy look from his flask , then gives it too her . Vanity throws her head ack , drinks fully , the liquor coursing over her cheeks . He devours her with his eyes , opens the door to the Caddy
VANITY: Huh , where 's Jerome ?
MORRIS: In his skinhee , hee He 's trying to nudge her into the Caddy-
VANITY: Is he coming ?
MORRIS: I gave him the night off .
VANITY: Why ? He staggers back from the car , undulates his hips wantonly
MORRIS: Whawhak ! She busts up . Just then a MOTORCYCLE can be heard off screen . They look around drunkenly , trying to discern its direction . Suddenly Prince BLASTS around the corner FULL OUT ! He streaks y Morris and KICKS him flat on his ass into the garbage
PRINCE: Get on ! There 's no way out ! Suddenly she lets out an excited YELP , jumps on . He guns the bike , BURSTS up the alley . Morris jumps into his path drunkenly , his arms extended
MORRIS: Stop ! Stop ! But Prince BLAZES down upon him , sending him slipping and sliding to safety . He BLASTS around the bend
VANITY: So here we are again . So this is it , huh ? What do you want this time ? He looks at her painfully , upset about her drunken state
PRINCE: No problem . I just wanted to talk , alright ? I just want us to be okay , to really get along . No big deal . She cackles , falls flat on her ass , hoists herself up
VANITY: No big deal , huh She pulls Morris ' FLASK from her jacket his eyes blacken
PRINCE: Give me that .
VANITY: No , definitely not . Who are you ? You ca n't tell me what to do . She puts it to her lips
PRINCE: Please do n't drink that . Give it to me . She holds the flask to her lips defiantly , then goes to drink . He lashes out suddenly , SMASHES it from her grip . She SCREAMS wildly , SLAPS him hard across the face . He stands shocked a moment , his rage surging within him , smashing through every safety valve he 's acquired in his life . He BACKHANDS he savagely across the jaw . She hits the ground like a rag doll . He looks at her curiously , bends over her - - she sucker-punches him with everything she 's got ! He SCREAMS in rage and grabs her hands as they flail about his face . He squeezes her fingers back while the tears stream down her cheeks and he mouth forms a silent `` ow '' ! She bares her teeth angrily and he sucks at he mouth , biting and kissing her in a feve pitch . She kicks at him violently , hot tears streaming down her cheeks . He jams his leg between hers , rubs it firmly against her bottom . She struggles helplessly against him as he covers her breasts , her stomach , her thighs with his lips . Quick breaths escape from her he eathing begins to race He snaps her panties in two , pulls them from between her legs . She spreads herself as he releases his pants . She squeezes his buttocks , pulls him toward her but Prince resists her coldly , egards her with contempt . Suddenly he flips her onto her stomach , forces he to stand painfully on her knees . He ubs his hand between her buttocks , then thrusts into her painfully , driving himself to the very depths of her but she stifles a cry , arches he ack , and meets his thrusts fiercely , moving quicker and quicker , banging he uttocks against his thighs again and again . She 's drawing from him now , turning the humiliation around , obtaining all that she needs and desires . He 's powerless her thrusts set the pace . She rises , Prince still inside her and tugs on him rapidly , causing him to ejaculate suddenly , drawing from him a sharp and sudden cry She moves away , draws her coat tightly about her , fixes him with a contemptuous look
THE DRIVER: spots her in his HEADLIGHTS , SLAMS on his brakes ! He SKIDS wildly across the oad , comes to a SCREECHING , BURNING stop inches from her thigh !
VANITY: shoots a look at Prince , her lips trembling , her love for him , written plainly on her face . But his eyes flash defiantly . She bites her lip sadly , then snaps a hot look at the Driver
PRINCE: Dad ? Silence . A sudden dread courses through him , leaving a hollow in his stomach . His feet are like lead . He moves heavily into the room
MEDIC: Lift ! And the gurney is hoisted up the stairs quickly , the bulk of the crowd following , his Mother supported as she ascends the stairs . Prince sits on a tattered sofa in the corner , his head bowed . Cops standing and kneeling beside him . Somebody finished taking notes , closes his pad . One Cop rests a hand on his shoulder , talks to him in soft tones . Prince shakes his head slightly . The Cop gives the group a signal and everyone disperses , moves up the stairs . The Cop looks at him sympathetically , then closes the door behind him .
PRINCE: sits motionless a long time . Moonlight floods the basement with a foreboding light . A dog BARKS somewhere in the distance . He looks up suddenly , his face agitated , his eyes red from tears .
PRINCE'S POV: CHALK MARKS on the floor outlining the ody of his Father . There 's a GUN in his Father 's hand clearly marked . A train WHISTLE in the distance . He 's staring at the gun . He shakes his head , ubs a hand over his face vigorously and looks up again the GUN in his Father 's hand . He ca n't get it out of his mind ! The WHISTLE is CLOSER . He lurches to his feet , paces back and forth crazily . His Father 's head , the gunthe gunthe The WHISTLE is LOUDER . He throws himself into the chair , buries his face deeply into his hands and cries . Huge racking sobs spasm through his body . His Father , his Mother , his entire life , his music , his guitar He looks up suddenly the gun in his Father 's hand . ..and he stares at it . The WHISTLE is LOUDER ! His heart is pounding in his ears . He squeezes them shut , looks up The gun . He bolts to his feet , paces back and forth in a panic ! The train is HOWLING ! A rope in the corner of the room , his face , the gun He sits dully , gazes at the rope as if in a trance . The TRAIN is ROARING past the house , it 's HORN BLASTING . The ope , the gun , and his body dangling from the rafters in the night breeze
PRINCE: Noooooo ! ! He lurches to his feet , cuts through the asement like a madman . He grabs a stick and starts SLASHING things crazily , moving through the room swinging his stick wildly again and again . He 's lost to himself now , deep in the pit of an unknown terror , expurgating a horror that has been festering in him for years . He flings his stick at the wall , unends shelves and bureaus , trampling old memories that have lain dormant for years . Drawer after drawer is flung against the wall , their contents smashing and scattering about . He opens a large , oaken chest and flips over . Thick three inch piles of yellowed paper fall out . He snaps through the rubber bands holding them together and flings the paper at the wall again and again he stops suddenly , shocked . He SEES musical notes written down on the paper . his heart pounding in his chest , he searches frantically through the rubble scattered about him . More and more musical notes , sketched ideas , simple melodies , entire songs and scores all meticulously recorded on lined yellowed paper , dated for the last 20 years , and signedby his Father . He 's shocked to a standstill . Then the full significance of what 's before him hits him like a sledgehammer . He collapses in agony against the chest , tears flowing down his cheeks .
ANOTHER ANGLE: Cool , gray dawn . He 's in a dead sleep on the floor , his arms outstretched , his legs twisted beneath him . His Father 's outline seemingly rests by his side Just then the basement window begins to glow with SUNLIGHT . It inches slowly across the floor , then sweeps him majestically , bathing him in its warmth . He wakes slowly , stretches his limbs like an opening flower . After a moment he sits up , shades his eyes The basement is littered with debris . The destruction is complete , but in the midst of it lies his Father 's music . The yellow parchment is scattered about glowing in the sunlight Something seems to flash across his mind . he stands , moves quickly down the hallway to the antechamber Suddenly we HEAR a TAPE REWINDING . After a momentMUSIC and we immediately recognize it as Lisa 's and Wendy 's SONG . It plays a moment , then snaps off abruptly . He stands locked in thought , then sits behind the piano , hunts for the first few notes of Lisa 's and Wendy 's song
MC: Let 's bring them back ! Ladies and gentlemen , The Time !
MORRIS: You love us right ? ! You want us right ? ! I ca n't hear you ! The CROWD is SCREAMING Morris flashes a wide , exaggerated grin
BILLY: Jesus !
BAND MEMBERS: It 's all over now . He bette watch out . He does n't even need to go on . He might as well go home .
MORRIS: How 's the family ! Whawhak ! The Time busts up , drags Morris from the oom . Prince 's group is shocked , casts furtive glances to him but he remains serene , then
MC: Ladies and gentlemen , please welcome Prince ! Applause offscreen . Prince stands abruptly , straps on his guitar . His Band Members look at him closely , trying to discern his feelings . He gives them a cursory glance , cuts out the door .
BILLY SPARKS: leans against the bar , a smug look on his face .
VANITY: walks slowly up the stairs , gazes at Prince .
PRINCE: does not move . The APPLAUSE trickles away . He continues to stare in the audience making no attempt to direct his Band , or start a tune . A nervous TWITTER ripples though the crowd . Those who know about the tragedy feel a profound embarrassment for him but no one turns away . Then his voice comes clear and mellifluous
VANITY: is crying . Every moment she has shared with him is expressed in this song , and the effect on her is unnerving . He heart leaps to him in a way she neve thought possible . But she lets it go willingly , as the words draw her in , seducing her somehow , making he freeas if the music , his words , all that he has experienced and understood , is purging what is confused and ugly within herself , leaving her with an understanding and joy that burns in he womb like soft fire . A smile springs to her lips as tears continue to flow , and she finds herself moving closer as the Audience moves closer , drawn somehow to the stage , to the person who SINGS so truly , to the person who gives of himself unselfishly to all that he feels Prince begins a long sustained CRY that cuts though the hearts of all present . The MUSIC builds awsomely , and he continues to sing out , emptying himself of all the remaining pain lying within . The MUSIC crescendos and comes to a quiet end Stunned SILENCE . A silence so profound you could hear a pin drop . Prince sighs , assumes the worse , then cuts across the stage purposefully . Now some CLAPPING . And a WHISTLE from the back and the SHOUTING . And more WHISTLES and some even SCREAMING . And the WHISTLES and the SHOUTS and the CLAPPING growing and growing as .
PRINCE: is still running though , his face streaming with tears , past the surprised look of Jill , past the FANS , past everyone stripping of his clothes fiercely , flinging off his jacket , his shirt , his scarf
JILL: Hi . And he whips into the hallway . Her face dissolves into a smile of pure joy .
VANITY: I love you . His knees go weak , she kisses him spontaneously , pushes him lovingly to the stage .
STAGE: THUNDER ! Prince walks center- stageand bows . The AUDIENCE goes BERSERK ! He acknowledges Wendy and Lisa , and then the entire Band . The CROWD is jumping out of their skin ! He straps on his guitar , gives a deft signal and MUSIC . The Band launches into `` I Would Die For You . '' Vanity squeezes her way through the crowd and stands watching Prince from the wings . He presses his lips to the mike and SINGS . The MUSIC continues as we
