MIA: A place you 've never been .
PENTCHO: That 's the physicist 's playground .
MIA: Why am I doing this ?
PENTCHO: It 's an experiment .
MIA: We flopped the first time out .
PENTCHO: At the sub-atomic level , particles obey their own logic . They connect in unimaginable ways .
MIA: And you think this is relevant to ou elationship ?
PENTCHO: Could be .
MIA: What universe are you in , Paul ?
PENTCHO: A quantum one .
MIA: The Buddhists have been saying that for a millennium .
PENTCHO: How ?
MIA: Baby , reality is what you choose to make it .
PENTCHO: God .
MIA: But only if you live your life that way . If you experience every moment as discovery .
PENTCHO: Mia ! You 're restoring heaven with dabs of paint . You 're bringing new order to the universe . She beams from his excitement .

MIA: And glow happily ever after .
EMPLOYEE: Rented every last ve-hicle . 'Cept one .
PENTCHO: I 'll take it . It 's a red 2000 BEETLE .
ALEXANDER: Paul Pauly Pentcho struggles to breathe . Staccato
PENTCHO: I I thought you were dead .
ALEXANDER: I must be .
PENTCHO: You taking any medication ? Alexander 's eyes FLARE in anger .
ALEXANDER: Do n't waste it Pauly . This is not an everyday talk . Just input the information and ask relevant questions . One how did a celebrated life of the mind bring me to this particula switching station ?
PENTCHO: Dad He shoves the shotgun into an open trash can .
ALEXANDER: Two what if I did n't miss ?
PENTCHO: You did .

WILL: You okay ?
PENTCHO'S VOICE: What do you want ?
VOICE: Impact !
ALEX: What the hell , Maudy .
LESTAT: Please do n't stop .
JAMES: What the f How did you get in here ?
LESTAT: The door , of course .
ALEX: Who the hell are you ?
LESTAT: You may call me the vampire Lestat .
ALEX: What the hell is this ?
LESTAT: Your lucky day .
JAMES: Cool . We got our very own vampire .
MAUDY: Hey , Vampire Lestat , I 've always wondered about Keith Richards
FANS: Lestat ! Lestat !
ROGER: May I present the Vampire Lestat .
LESTAT: Good evening . I 'm so sorry I 'm late . I was just having my eakfast .
JOURNALIST: Excellent makeup job . Marilyn Manson , look out
ROGER: Hey , hey ! We 're gon na keep this short here ! One at a time . You ! He points to a PRETTY FRENCH JOURNALIST .
LESTAT: Yes . But why hide it in this day and age ? I 've hidden in the shadows for centuries . It 's time to share myself with the world .
MUSIC JOURNALIST: And it does n't hurt the record sales , huh ? Your album just topped all kinds of sales records .
LESTAT: Our label is n't complaining , no .
LIFESTYLE JOURNALIST: Why not a demo at your own house ? I mean , what 's with all the secrecy about where you stay ? Is it true you move residences every few days ?
LESTAT: After calling one stone tomb home sweet home for so long , I like to experience as much diversity as I can . Would n't you ? The Lifestyle Journalist smiles .
MUSIC JOURNALIST: There are a lot of rumors flying around the internet about the hidden meaning in your lyrics , that you 're giving away 'vampire secrets . ' Something in all that ?
MUSIC JOURNALIST: Of the closet .
LESTAT: The casket
MUSIC JOURNALIST: Your first and only concert 's in Death Valley , just days away . Why just the one ?
LESTAT: I do n't like repeating myself .
MUSIC JOURNALIST: But these other vampires , are n't they going to be pissed that you 're giving away their secrets ?
LESTAT: I imagine they are , yes .
LIFESTYLE JOURNALIST: Do you have anything to say to the other vampires listening out there ?
LESTAT: Yes , as a matter of fact , I do
VAMPIRE #1: Goddamn fool 's going to bring back the Inquisition .
VAMPIRE #2: I say we kill him , before this gets out of hand . Bleed him dry .
VAMPIRE #1: Got ta find him first . Elusive loke . Never know where he 's going to turn up .
VAMPIRE #2: Well we know one place he 's definitely going to be
VAMPIRE #1: When I was in Manchester , the coven there was saying exactly the same thing . That we should nail him at the concert
LESTAT: See you all in Death Valley . CLICK . The screen goes black .
VAMPIRE: Ah , Jesse . You want to come and play with us , do n't you ? She stares at him , nervous , intrigued .
JESSE: No !
JESSE: I have reason to believe Lestat 's the real thing . A vampire . And an ancient one .
TALAMASCAN #1: I do n't know , Jesse . It looks to me like the guy 's got a good P.R . man with a flair for the theatrical .
JESSE: It would appear that way . But have you listened to his songs ? Read his lyrics ?
JESSE: Well , i have . In one of his songs he refers to a pub called the Sailor 's Arms . I think it 's a clue
JESSE: And here is where it would be today . Of course the Sailor 's Arms is not there anymore . That part of London is mostly old warehouses , meat-packing plants .
TALAMASCAN #2: In a few years it will be artists ' lofts and pretentious French cafes Jesse leans forward now as she talks .
JESSE: Yes , but right now there 's only one place to get a drink of sorts . A private club in exactly the same place . The Waverly Arms . On screen , a photo of the Waverly Arms .
TALAMASCAN #1: And what makes you think so ?
TALAMASCAN #2: Jesse , can you , uh , focus that any etter ?
JESSE: Well it was taken while in motion .
TALAMASCAN #3: Interesting . Perhaps we should assign someone to observe
TALAMASCAN #1: Oh please , based on this so-called 'data ' ? That 's a waste of time .
JESSE: But uh
TALAMASCAN #2: Wait a second . Who took this picture ?
JESSE: I did .
TALAMASCAN #2: You went there ?
JESSE: Yes . Last night .
TALAMASCAN #1: And who gave you this directive ?
JESSE: No one . I just went . Look , I know it was breaking protocol and I 'm really sorry , it 's just I think
TALAMASCAN #1: Jesse ! You 're just an apprentice here ! You must follow ou ules Or perhaps we need to econsider your position . She stares at him .
TALAMASCAN #3: For 12 centuries our mission as Talamascans has been to observe and record paranormal behavior . But never get involved . You 're getting far too close .
JESSE: Hey , does it look like I got involved ? That is not called involvement . That is called unning .
TALAMASCAN #2: But , Jesse , tell us , what did you see ? Jesse turns to her .
JESSE: Vampires . Gathering . I 'm sure of it .
TALAMASCAN #1: It does n't make any sense . Why would he be forecasting this to the world ? He 's all but drawn a map and marked an X . What vampires hold sacred is keeping their kind a secret . You neve name other immortals , tell where their lairs are . They 'd be hunted down .
JESSE: Right . That 's the best part . Lestat 's not afraid to piss them off . He wants mortals and immortals to know he 's there , to know he exists . I do n't know why But this has never happened efore . Do n't you see ? He 's a one man revolution .
TALAMASCAN #1: And this photo is your evidence ? It 's hardly conclusive . C'mon . It looks like the Blai witch !
JESSE: Fine . Well then , I guess I 'll just have to go back and get etter , more conclusive evidence ! Maybe you just ca n't unravel all the mysteries of the world out there , by sitting around all day in a dusty old library in here !
TALBOT: My office . Now .
SLEEK BOUNCER: Okay , you , in . You . No You in You , no .
UNATTRACTIVE GUY: C'mon , man , she 's waiting for me in there . She said she was putting me on the list . My name 's Norman
BOUNCER #1: Yeah , yeah , right . Hey , get a life , alright ? You , in .
LESTAT: You . In
LESTAT: You . No .
ROGER: Yeah , Phil . We 'll need a limo from the airport . I do n't know which airfield yet I do n't know the arrival time either .
ROGER: just uh shy that 's it shy .
JAMES: We rock .
LESTAT: Yes , I 'd say I 'm down with that . They all laugh .
JAMES: I 'm ready for Los Angeles
MAUDY: I 'm ready for Death Valley . Two days till we go
ALEX: Think we can call that a night .
LESTAT: Oh , the sweet song of her blood . Roger stares on , terrified .
LESTAT: Be careful , Roger . Very careful .
TALBOT: How 's everything ? You alright ? You sleeping okay ?
JESSE: Yeah , I 'm great . I just found a vampire .
TALBOT: Jesse you 're taking this Lestat stuff pretty seriously why ?
JESSE: Cause I think I 'm on to something pretty big . The most important sighting Talamasca 's had in years Jesus , I do n't know , David I thought I was onto something Maybe I did n't see anything
TALBOT: You know we work in a really strange field ? The supernatural is beguiling at times . It does n't like to just be observed , it is only satisfied when it has drawn us in completely . I know cause I 've felt these things myself .
JESSE: Talbot . C'mon . You know me . I 'm not freaking out on you . I 'm just onto what looks alright looked like a good lead . You 're the one who taught me how to do all this . You 're the one who taught me to keep pushing and pushing
TALBOT: Alright . Just checking
JESSE: I 'd be even luckier if that damn picture came out Wait a second . So you do believe me ? You do think it 's a vampire coven .
TALBOT: Yes . But not exactly for the easons you think . Though you esearch is top-notch of course Come back here . I 'm gon na show you something .
JESSE: They 're all nightscapes . The detail is amazing . Mid-1500s . Florence .
TALBOT: Right . And what do you see in this one ?
JESSE: This man is in both .
TALBOT: Right . He 's in all of them .
JESSE: Have you
TALBOT: Carbon tested ? Yes . The different paint samples are all authentic . All painted at the time of that particular style . Jesse stops at a contemporary self-portrait .
JESSE: Marius ? ! From Lestat 's lyrics . I knew I was right .
TALBOT: Yes , you were . Good work . She smiles at him , victorious .
JESSE: What do you mean the original vampire ?
TALBOT: There 's a Mesopotamian legend that there once was a queen of Egypt , Akasha , long before Tutankhamen o Nefertiti . She was believed to be the original vampire Marius himself dates back to 400 B.C
JESSE: David , you 've been tracking Marius your whole life . Maybe he 's out there waiting for you right now . Do n't you ever want to just go and find him and Talbot crosses to her .
TALBOT: No . Jesus , we are not talking about having a drink at the Dorchester , Jesse . You know that . Especially with the ancient vampires the older they are , the more powerful , the more dangerous He takes her by the arm , smiles down at her .
JESSE: You do ? He steers her over to a locked cabinet .
TALBOT: Yes . And I 'll tell you something . I 've never shown this to anyone . No one else has proved themself in the way you have .
JESSE: Thanks . What is it ? As he unlocks the cabinet
TALBOT: Oh you 're gon na love this . Although I 'm sure it will keep you up nights to come with nightmares
TALBOT: Lestat 's diary . I found it some years ago . This is where you 'll find the answers you need .
JESSE: Thank you for this .
TALBOT: My pleasure . When I took you on as an apprentice , I knew it was the smartest thing I 'd ever done . Now you and I 'll meet when you 're done This will be our project
JESSE: Je suis le vampire Lestat I am the vampire Lestat .
MARIUS: Lestat . Welcome .
LESTAT: Who are you ? Do I know you ?
MARIUS: I 'm unknowable by nature . Marius advances again on the young man
LESTAT: I 'm the lord of a great manor . They 'll send an army of men to look for me .
MARIUS: I doubt they 'll find you , Lord De Lioncourt . You 're a long way from home
LESTAT: I 'll kill you ! Marius smiles , impressed .
MARIUS: You really do fear nothing . It is why I chose you . Because you think things are possible which are n't possible Lestat stares at him , his eyes wide .
LESTAT: Chose me ? For what ?
MARIUS: My companion . Someone to share my urden . Bending down , he gazes at Lestat .
LESTAT: I 'm dying .
MARIUS: Then drink .
MARIUS: There there that will do . But Lestat keeps on feeding hungrily .
LESTAT: More !
MARIUS: That 's enough , my son When you feed , you must hold back from the moment of death . You must neve take the last drop , or it will draw you in and you will die
LESTAT: Humanity ? We 're murderers .
MARIUS: We 're more than that . Their blood that we take into us carries with it life their life , thei knowledge , their complexity . Appreciate your prey , Lestat .
MARIUS: The trick is to find the way to face eternity head on . The spirit can be annihilated by oredom just as the body can be destroyed by sun or fire . My solace , my delight , is witnessing the unfolding of human destiny
LESTAT: But why must we hide , Marius ? We are the powerful , we are the immortal . We should walk fearless in the open !
MARIUS: Shhh . The life of a vampire is a life of discretion . We must sleep during the day , when we are vulnerable to the sun . Mortals must never know about us . It is forbidden , for the sake of all ou kind .
LESTAT: So I could never know her ?
MARIUS: Not unless you wanted to kill her .
LESTAT: So I can never be known ?
MARIUS: You 're known by me . I granted you that . There are others of ou kind though most are solitary creatures .
LESTAT: My God
MARIUS: Forget God . You 're no longer in his realm . Now we must leave .
FATHER: Fantasma ! ! Teras ! !
MARIUS: Stop her , Lestat !
LESTAT: My God , what have you done to me ?
YUPPIE: Wow . This is the coolest afte hours club ever . You sure you do n't want a drink ?
VAMPIRE GIRL: Soon .
JESSE: Sure , all the time .
JESSE: You have n't seen the rest of my ody .
JESSE: Marius has the blood of the ancients flowing in his veins .
JESSE: You know , it 's like they say the more things change , the more they stay the same . For you that 's forever , right ?
JESSE: You saved me .
LESTAT: Perhaps So you know Marius
JESSE: I know a lot of things .
LESTAT: Not how to stay alive apparently .
JESSE: Well I guess we 've got that in common . Although I think I 'm a little ahead in the race here .
LESTAT: Well , I can fix that .
JESSE: 'Mine eyes dazzle , she died so young . ' It 's about the girl with the violin , is n't it ?
LESTAT: Is it ? And what else do you think you know ?
JESSE: I I think you 're a lot like Marius , Lestat .
LESTAT: Am I ? Tell me all about it .
JESSE: You 're you 're both artists . He 's a painter . You 're a singer
LESTAT: Is that so ? What I do is art , is it ?
JESSE: Yes From nothing you try to create something beautiful out of the the cold , dark wasteland of eternity
LESTAT: Something beautiful
JESSE: But but Marius is n't a rebel . You 're different in that way . You do n't want to hide , follow the laws , concealed in the shadows like some insect . You you still want to walk with the living , do n't you , Lestat ?
LESTAT: Well , I 'm not hiding now , am I ?
JESSE: No , but the only time you 're not eally alone is when you kill But , Lestat , you ca n't help it it 's not your fault He made you this way
LESTAT: Ah . Poor , poor me
LESTAT: How sad , you people always trying to know the unknowable So , was it a good read ? My diary .
JESSE: I I 'm only an apprentice . He waves her off , dismissive .
LESTAT: Go . I 'm through with you . You kind never satisfies my thirst .
JESSE: Does anything , Lestat ?
LESTAT: You better just stick to you ooks , Talamascan . 'Cause you have it all wrong . I love all this . I delight in it . The dark , dreary world I went to sleep in has burnt itself out and een replaced by the 20th Century can you imagine my joy at waking up to discover such a world ? It has outdistanced my wildest dreams of it . I scream of good and evil , and mortals stand and cheer . I adore being back in action every moment , every single drop of it ! Now conside yourself exceedingly lucky and go !
JESSE: Lestat ! He turns back , stares at her , astonished .
LESTAT: What ?
JESSE: You kept her violin , did n't you ?
JESSE: Jesus Christ .
GROUPIE #2: I heard that Lestat keeps all these girls in all his wine cellars , and it 's really nice , and they give you food and cable and weed .
GROUPIE #1: Oh , please
GROUPIE #2: That 's what I heard . But you have to let him suck you on your neck whenever he wants . Does n't sound too bad .
GROUPIE #1: We 've done worse .
GROUPIE #2: Damn straight Hey , do you emember that cute guy 's name at the Kid Rock concert ? The one ehind the bathroom .
GROUPIE #1: Oh yeah . Let me think his first name was Blow . And his second name was Me , I think . They crack up .
LESTAT: Clever , clever librarian .
ROGER: I did n't see you come in .
LESTAT: No , Roger , you would n't have .
ROGER: So this house is fine I assume . To your liking ?
LESTAT: Yes . For the moment .
ROGER: We 'll be here for what ? A week you think ?
LESTAT: Well I would n't unpack if I were you .
ROGER: Right the girls you asked for . They 're in the guest wing .
LESTAT: Ah . Yes . Lestat gazes at the door , pensive .
ROGER: Do you want me to take them home later ?
LESTAT: No , thank you , Roger . I 'll make sure they 're taken care of .
GROUPIE #1: Oh my God It 's really you , is n't it ?
GROUPIE #2: We want to be your slaves .
LESTAT: Of course you do . He smiles . She offers a joint .
GROUPIE #1: Want some ? Lestat calmly shakes his head .
LESTAT: I 'm always hungry .
GROUPIE #1: We 've got the munchies ? You got any food ?
LESTAT: Vampires do n't eat food .
GROUPIE #1: You hungry for something else ?
LESTAT: Mine eyes dazzle , she died so young .
GROUPIE #1: Huh ?
LESTAT: It 's a very old poem of mine .
GROUPIE #1: C'mon , do n't you want to have some fun ?
LESTAT: Do n't do that .
GROUPIE #1: Are you ticklish ?
LESTAT: I 'm very ticklish . The Second Groupie giggles as well
GROUPIE #2: Hey , you ever been tickled by fou hands at once ? Hey , can you take oth us , Lestat ? What'd'ya think ?
LESTAT: I do n't know . Let 's see .
JESSE: You 're right , David . The journal has everything in it .
TALBOT: Jesse , you listen to me very , very carefully now . You are no longe seeing things clearly . You emotions are clouding things .
JESSE: It 's not emotion . It 's instinct I 'll return when I have my findings . Good-bye .
LESTAT: Marius !
MARIUS: What have you done , Lestat ? Lestat !
LESTAT: More !
MARIUS: I do n't think so , my little lord .
LESTAT: Let me go !
MARIUS: No . You 've drunk the purest lood . Seen the oldest of things far too much for one as young as you . You 've been unconscious for days .
LESTAT: God , her blood is like liquid fire . Who are they ?
MARIUS: She she is your mother , my mother Akasha , the Queen of all who are damned . And he is he King .
LESTAT: Release me !
MARIUS: She made you quite powerful . Do n't make me use this !
LESTAT: Marius , please , just one more time . I felt the sun . The light , Marius , the light !
MARIUS: Lestat , listen to me ! I have watched over Akasha and her King for 2000 years ! They must neve awaken ! Lestat stares up at him .
MARIUS: If she were ever to rise , she would again desiccate the earth ! She has no respect for anything except the taste of blood . Immortal and human alike
LESTAT: You 'll not stop me Marius stares at him , shocked .
MARIUS: I hear her blood in your voice In all the years I 've cared fo them , not once have they moved
LESTAT: Until tonight . And she chose me ! Me ! Never you ! You 'll not stop me !
MARIUS: You are part of a great coven ! You take responsibility for you kind !
LESTAT: I must have more !
MARIUS: I chose you for your bravery , but I was wrong . You know only selfishness . I can no longer trust you It gives me no pleasure to look upon what I have created .
LESTAT: Marius ! No response .
JESSE: Lestat .
ATTENDANT: We 've started our approach into L.A. You should fasten your seat elt .
LESTAT: I hate bedtime .
MARIUS: Lestat .
MARIUS: It is good to see you , Lestat .
LESTAT: And you . Still wearing the old fashions , I see .
MARIUS: Old habits die hard .
LESTAT: How did you manage to slip through the 1950s in red velvet ?
MARIUS: I slept .
LESTAT: Do n't think you missed much .
MARIUS: Elvis .
LESTAT: Elvis , yes .
MARIUS: You 're bigger than he is now .
LESTAT: I 'd say a few pounds lighter . Though , if you ever catch me wearing a white jumpsuit , you have my permission to slice off my head .
MARIUS: If someone does n't get to you first . Lestat grins , feeling Marius 's disapproval .
LESTAT: Live and let live .
MARIUS: If it were only so simple , my son .
LESTAT: How did you find me ?
MARIUS: You forget . We ancients have powers no ordinary vampires possess And I know you . I emembered how you admired the medieval fortresses in the hilltowns of Lyon . All you 're missing is the moat and the cannons which you may need . Lestat does n't want to hear it .
LESTAT: Come , let me show you what it means to live in the light .
MARIUS: Impressive . Reminds me of mad old Druids running around chanting in the forest . Very primitive stuff .
LESTAT: Out there . My fans . Thousands and thousands . They worship me . Millions of arms reach out to embrace , beg me to come into thei lives .
MARIUS: It 's what you 've always wanted .
LESTAT: With all my black little heart .
MARIUS: Do you think of anyone but yourself ?
LESTAT: I only have myself .
MARIUS: It may be time to get ready fo some company .
LESTAT: What 's that supposed to mean ?
MARIUS: Your music 's woken a very old friend Lestat looks at Marius , trying to understand .
LESTAT: Good ! I 'm glad she 's risen ! Let her come .
MARIUS: Do n't you understand ? You must stop this concert !
LESTAT: 200 years and the same broken ecord .
MARIUS: No . Not the same ! You 've only known Akasha dormant . She too will find you . She is choosing her moment . She has come to destroy you , Lestat . And in he wrath , she will devour everything that moves . Mortal and vampire alike .
LESTAT: Well then , it 's every vampire fo himself . Just the kind of rules I like . The rules you taught me .
MARIUS: And you 're taking everyone with you , you fool ! We were once mortals , too . It is our heritage we protect !
LESTAT: Such reverence for mortals ! Then you should have left me as one !
MARIUS: You 're a monster .
LESTAT: Said the vampire to his son .
AKASHA: Hello
VAMPIRE LOVER: You like him , love ?
AKASHA: He reminds me of someone I know .
VAMPIRE LOVER: All he 's gon na remind you of soon is a pile of bones . We 're gon na dismember him . Bleed him dry .
AKASHA: Really ? Is that what you 're going to do ?
AKASHA: Then again , you could always do this
AKASHA: Turn up the music ! The terrified barman quickly COMPLIES .
MAEL: Marius , you 've broken your oath . You were to watch over Akasha and Khayman . You are a great disappointment to me .
MARIUS: Pandora , Armand , it 's been a long time . Khayman , Maharet , to what do I owe this honor ?
KHAYMAN: You have been summoned because of your errant child
PANDORA: He 's quite the devil , is n't he ?
ARMAND: His music mocks us , Pandora !
PANDORA: His music moves my blood .
ARMAND: Keep your amorous thoughts to yourself . His music is a threat to all vampires . We will let the covens dismember him at his concert .
MAEL: Yes . It will set an example .
MARIUS: I do n't see how this solves things . This is n't thought through .
KHAYMAN: Marius , we understand you affection for Lestat , but you duty is to us !
MAEL: No . We will contact the covens . Let them know we condone the slaying . It will be better fo all to see .
MAHARET: Wait . Never mind Lestat ! We have greater problems
MARIUS: Maharet is right . It is Akasha we face now .
PANDORA: Is it true , Maharet ? Has ou Queen really risen !
MAHARET: Do n't be so happy , Pandora . I knew Akasha when she walked this earth . I was her slave . I am now her enemy . I know what she is capable of .
ARMAND: Yes . We 've all felt her presence , even as she hides from us . What does she want now ?
MAHARET: She knows only one thing . Taking pleasure in destroying life . She is already killing the young ones to build her strength .
MARIUS: She 's sucked the life out of he King like a praying mantis . I sense she is getting closer .
MAHARET: She has come to destroy Lestat , ut he will only whet her thirst more
MAEL: But can she be destroyed ? I am left to bear the scars of the last attempt on her life . She was dragged into the sun . She survived . But we almost did n't
MARIUS: What happens to our Queen happens to us . If Akasha dies , we die as well .
MAHARET: Then so be it ! We must take that chance .
ARMAND: But perhaps she has come to kill Lestat and then will go back to he slumber . That is our only hope .
PANDORA: Yes . That 's right . She and the covens will take care of that at . We must go to the concert and pay our respects to our great Queen .
MAHARET: How ? With your own throat ! You 've all been asleep too long ! You 're still dreaming . Marius steps up beside Maharet .
MARIUS: Maharet speaks the truth . It is our only hope .
MAEL: No . Armand is right . We will go to the concert and first see what she does . There may be no need for action .
MAHARET: Then you go to the concert and you shall see ! And I thought the Ancients became wise with their years .
ROGER: The girls you asked for , Lestat . They 're here , in the guest wing .
LESTAT: Ah . Yes . Lestat gazes in that direction , pensive .
ROGER: I was uh just gon na go catch a movie at the Chinese . I do n't suppose you 'd all want to
LESTAT: No , thank you , Roger . We 'll entertain ourselves .
GROUPIE #3: Oh my God , it 's him ! It 's really him
LESTAT: Perhaps you would like a tou of the place first .
GROUPIE #3: Oh yeah , wow , we 'd love that .
LESTAT: Roger would you be so kind ?
ROGER: Sure . Right this way , girls .
LESTAT: Roger . Not that one . Leave he to me
JESSE: It 's not . I I came on my own . He stares at her , taking her in .
LESTAT: How did you find me ?
JESSE: I 've been tracking your manage for days Then I figured out you simply have to look the part .
LESTAT: Clever librarian You should know , based on all your research , that groupies do n't ever find their way out of here again .
JESSE: I 'm not a groupie
LESTAT: Then why are you following me ? What do you want ?
JESSE: Are you granting wishes ?
LESTAT: Last wishes . What 's yours ?
JESSE: Show me what it 's like to be you . That 's my last wish . Grant it , Lestat .
LESTAT: I do n't have time for this .
JESSE: All a vampire has is time .
LESTAT: Maybe not .
JESSE: Right . The covens are coming fo you . I understand why you 're doing it . You have to be who you are , no matter what happens .
JESSE: But how are you spending what may e your last night on Earth , Lestat ? As you always have Alone .
LESTAT: You do n't know what you 're asking ! I do n't know what 's in that librarian 's head of yours , but it 's not what you think .
JESSE: That 's right . You do n't know what 's in my head , Lestat . Do you want to ?
LESTAT: I 'll know when I kill you .
JESSE: Gee , Lestat , that 's a great way to get to know someone . Here . I 'll give you a preview . Coming attractions . This is what you 'll find . She crosses to him , stands close .
JESSE: That I will have the dream again Because in the dream I 'm happy . And the dream is more real than my life I do n't know how , but I know you , Lestat My life is a ig mystery and you , you have the answer
LESTAT: Are we ? I seek the light . You seek the shadows .
JESSE: No . We 're looking for exactly the same thing . You know it Please . Show me .
LESTAT: Alright ! Jesse breaks into a smile .
JESSE: I do n't care .
LESTAT: Close your eyes . Do n't breathe .
JESSE: Do that again !
LESTAT: And now for my next trick .
JESSE: Did it hurt ?
LESTAT: Yes . For just a moment . But as the pain is more intense for us , so is ecstacy . You see , we love our victims .
JESSE: Love ? I thought it was the blood .
LESTAT: No , although the taste is so rich and sweet . Love is the essence of the dark gift . The connection is so much more satisfying , brief as it is , than anything else .
LESTAT: As you drink , you feel the heart weakening it struggles even though there 's no hope . You feel the life slipping away , the flash of those brief years . The taste of mortality you can no longe experience and it is eautiful No 'relationship , ' no commingling can ever reach the heights of that experience .
JESSE: Do you like it ?
LESTAT: Yes
JESSE: Do it to me Please With you lood I 'll know you
LESTAT: You want to know everything . You want to see what it 's like . Then come ! I 'll show you .
JESSE: Is she alright ?
LESTAT: Come closer , Jesse . You want to see ? You want to know ?
JESSE: Lestat , no !
LESTAT: You see now ? Are you ready ? Now do you want it ? !
JESSE: Lestat ! Wait !
LESTAT: Good-bye , Talamascan .
YOUNG JESSE: Why ca n't I stay with you ? ! Please , Auntie Maharet !
MAHARET: I do n't want you to go , but you must .
YOUNG JESSE: Auntie , you 're bleeding
MAHARET: You must be with your own , my sweetest girl . I 'll always be watching over you .
YOUNG JESSE: I want to stay with you forever .
MAHARET: Forever is a very long time .
MAHARET: Hello , my princess .
JESSE: Aunt Maharet ?
MAHARET: Yes . Oh , Jesse , I 've missed you so much , but I had to keep this from you .
JESSE: Oh my God , this is why I knew I was different . I knew
MAHARET: Come
JESSE: Am I ?
MAHARET: No . You are not . I was once mortal , too . My sister died efore her child was one year old . I took care of that child , and he children , and her children 's children Pointing up to the huge family tree
MAHARET: You are my most prized light . You are what keeps me connected to the world of the living . Jesse stares at Maharet , amazed .
JESSE: And something happened there .
MAHARET: I stopped it from happening . And I will again . Maharet stands close , gazes at her .
JESSE: I thought I was like him .
MAHARET: I know , but it is not who you are , not who you are meant to be . You have found that out now .
JESSE: Lestat 's all I can think about I felt like I belonged with him . Now I know why
MAHARET: Jesse , you must forget about him . You must trust me
JESSE: I missed you so much , Aunt Maharet .
MAHARET: Me too .
JESSE: But this is my home . This is where I belong . Why do you want to get rid of me so quickly ? Maharet touches her face gently .
MAHARET: Now is not the time to be here
LESTAT: Jesse .
VAMPIRE DRIVER: Need a ride ?
JESSE: Yeah .
MARIUS: Hello , David .
PANDORA: It 's just like Nero 's day . They scan the horizon , the darkening sky .
MAHARET: Akasha will not be able to resist this
ROGER: They 're getting pretty worked up out there .
LESTAT: Come on , children .
ENGINEER #1: Could we turn it down a tad ?
ENGINEER #2: His mic 's not even up . They stare , dumbfounded .
LESTAT: You want more ? ! The crowd screams
CROWD: Yes !
LESTAT: This one 's for those who 've come for me !
PANDORA: There are too many of them ! They 're going to dismember him . Armand is enjoying the show .
ARMAND: Good !
LESTAT: Get out of here !
JESSE: Lestat ! Lestat !
MARIUS: Akasha .
MAHARET: She is here
FIRE MARSHAL: You do n't have a permit for any of these stunts !
ROGER: I told you I do n't know anything about it !
ROGER: Last time I work for a bloody vampire
JESSE: Lestat ! Lestat !
LESTAT: Akasha
AKASHA: Why so surprised , my love ? You called , and I have come .
LESTAT: My wishes ?
AKASHA: You have yearned for a companion to share eternity . You have cried out to the world . I have answered your call .
LESTAT: Had a King ?
AKASHA: He 's no more . You are my consort . I 've kept you safe alive .
LESTAT: You ?
AKASHA: You thought it was all you ? You have the ego of a king as well . I know you , Lestat . I know that you crave to have the world at your feet . I have come to give it to you .
LESTAT: Never .
AKASHA: But you did n't kill the mortal girl . Lestat looks caught .
LESTAT: Can we try that again ?
MAHARET: We see now what Akasha means to do . Rule as Queen again . This is why we must fight Akasha !
MAHARET: For the sake of all mortals . She must be stopped , or the mortal world will end .
MAEL: But is there a way ? We do n't know .
KHAYMAN: When she opens herself to give he lood , she is vulnerable .
MARIUS: Then we weaken her . Drain her of almost all her blood , but leave her just one drop .
MAHARET: We ca n't take that chance . We must finish her .
ARMAND: If she dies , we all die .
PANDORA: We 're damned no matter what happens .
MAHARET: Perhaps .
JESSE: And what about Lestat ?
MAHARET: Lestat has joined with Akasha . He is lost to us now . He is neve coming back .
JESSE: I do n't believe that .
LESTAT: Where are we ?
AKASHA: We are home .
LESTAT: You live here ?
AKASHA: We live everywhere and anywhere we choose . The world is our garden .
LESTAT: So warm their blood
AKASHA: yes
LESTAT: they 're mortal
AKASHA: of course . They serve the living goddess , and her consort . They find you beautiful . You are a god in their eyes .
LESTAT: Why ?
AKASHA: Why not ?
LESTAT: This is the reason you have risen ?
AKASHA: They believed in nothing , now they are nothing . But you and I will change all that . We will give the world something to believe in again .
MARIUS: She comes
AKASHA: My children . It warms my blood to see you all gathered plotting against me .
MAHARET: Akasha .
AKASHA: Maharet . You will address my King first
JESSE: Lestat !
LESTAT: Made me see .
MARIUS: Lestat step aside .
LESTAT: Never . She is my Queen .
MAHARET: Akasha . The world has changed since you reigned .
AKASHA: Then we shall change it back . Humans are animals , brute creatures . Their destruction can only make sense .
MAHARET: We 've found other ways to co- exist .
AKASHA: Yes . In the shadows . In silence . In shame . For what ? For respect of mortals ? They are nothing to us . They are only food .
AKASHA: Poor Maharet . Still trying to hold onto what I took from you . Maharet does n't even flinch .
MARIUS: Akasha , please
AKASHA: You think you can change my will ? I 'm tired of this discussion . Join me , or die .
MAHARET: I will not .
MARIUS: I will not .
AKASHA: I want to hear it from every one of you . What will it be ?
LESTAT: Yes
AKASHA: Prove it . Kill her .
LESTAT: She 's nothing to me .
AKASHA: Just the same , I 'd like you to kill her . For me . I 've had enough of this 'great family . ' It 's time to end it . Maharet steps between Lestat and Jesse .
MAHARET: You will not touch her !
AKASHA: You still think to challenge me , Maharet ?
MAHARET: I beg you , spare this child .
AKASHA: Now .
JESSE: It 's all right , Maharet .
AKASHA: How sweet
AKASHA: Good-bye , great family .
LESTAT: But , My Queen , you 've forgotten my eward ! She turns to him .
AKASHA: That 's right . My King , you 've just earned your crown .
AKASHA: You see how he obeys . You will o you will all die !
AKASHA: You kill me , you kill yourselves .
MAHARET: Wait , Lestat ! You must stop !
KHAYMAN: We survived ! The Ancients let out relieved hisses .
LESTAT: I left you one drop , my love . Drink deep and live .
JESSE: I thought I 'd lost you
LESTAT: Drink , my love .
JESSE: Maharet
MAHARET: My child , let me look at you You are finally happy . It is as it should be now I will watch over you always .
ARMAND: She took Akasha 's last drop , took Akasha 's death into herself . Behold , our Queen our new mother
JESSE: Is she dead ?
KHAYMAN: No , she will live forever . She sleeps . She sleeps , and dreams of us .
MARIUS: My Queen , I will watch over you always .
TALBOT: Jesse . My God
JESSE: David , this is Lestat . He looks at Lestat , fear in his eyes .
TALBOT: How do you do ?
LESTAT: Charmed , I 'm sure .
JESSE: I told you I 'd return with my findings . Here they are . David stares , shaken .
TALBOT: But please , sit down . You 'll have to excuse me it 's just so so
LESTAT: Unexpected ?
TALBOT: Strangely , no David looks sadly at Jesse .
JESSE: Please do n't be sad . I 'm where I elong . I 'm happy now .
TALBOT: Excuse me for asking but
JESSE: What 's it like ?
TALBOT: Yes .
JESSE: Do you want to find out ?
TALBOT: Me ? No . I 'm too old to live forever .
JESSE: Well , if you ever should change your mind Oh . I have a present for you . From an old friend .
TALBOT: Yes . Take care of her , Lestat .
LESTAT: Always .
TALBOT: Good-bye , Jesse .
JESSE: Good-bye , dear friend .
LESTAT: Shall we go get a drink , love ?
COMMENTARY: ..here 's Tony Blair , just 43 years old , arriving at the polling station of his constituency in Sedgefield.. ''
ELIZABETH: Have you voted yet , Mr Crawford ?
ARTIST: And I do n't mind telling you , it was n't for Mr Blair .
ELIZABETH: Not a moderniser , then ?
ARTIST: Certainly not . We 're in danger of losing too much that 's good about this country as it is .
TV COMMENTARY: `` The only questions that still remain how big will his landslide be ? And how extensive , how sweeping will the modernisation programme be that he ushers in ? ''
ELIZABETH: Hmm .
ARTIST: Yes..
ELIZABETH: No .
ARTIST: Still , you wo n't catch me feeling sorry for you . You might not be allowed to vote , Ma'am.. But it IS your Government .
ELIZABETH: Yes .
MAID: G'morning , Ma'am .
DRESSER: Shall I draw the curtains ?
RESSER: Yes , Ma'am . Mr Blair , by a landslide .
ELIZABETH: I see .
JANVRIN: The Prime Minister is on his way , Ma'am .
ELIZABETH: To BE , Robin . Prime Minister to BE .
JANVRIN: Yes . On the one hand his background is quite establishment . Father a Conservative . A public school education at Fettes , where he was tutored by the same man as the Prince of Wales .
ELIZABETH: Well , we 'll try not to hold that against him .
JANVRIN: On the other , his manifesto promises the most radical modernisation and shake-up of the Constitution in three hundred years .
ELIZABETH: Oh . Is he going to ` modernise ' us , do you think ?
JANVRIN: I would n't put it past him . He 's married to a woman with known anti- Monarchist sympathies - you may emember her curtsey the first time you met . It could best be described as ` shallow ' .
ELIZABETH: I do n't measure the depth of a curtsey , Robin . I leave that to my sister .
JANVRIN: And I spoke to the Cabinet Secretary who said he was expecting the atmosphere at Downing Street to be very informal . Everyone on first name terms . At the Prime Minister 's insistence .
ELIZABETH: What ? As in ` Call me Tony ? '
JANVRIN: Yes .
ELIZABETH: Oh . I 'm not sure I like the sound of that . Have we sent him a protocol sheet ?
TONY: Funny , I 'm actually rather nervous .
HERIE: hy ? You 've met her often enough efore .
TONY: I know . But never one to one . And never as Prime Minister .
CHERIE: Remember , you 're a man that 's just een elected by the whole country .
TONY: The Queen .

TONY: Yes..
EQUERRY: And when you 're in the Presence , at no point must you show your back .
TONY: The ` Presence ' ?
EQUERRY: Yes , Sir . That 's what it 's called , when you 're in her Majesty 's company .
ELIZABETH: ongratulations .
TONY: Thank you , Ma'am .
ELIZABETH: Your children must be very proud .
TONY: I hope so .
ELIZABETH: You 've three , have n't you ?
TONY: That 's right .
ELIZABETH: How lovely . Such a blessing . Children .
TONY: No .
ELIZABETH: First thing we do , I believe . a beat ) Then we take your passport and spend the rest of the time sending you around the world .
TONY: You obviously know my job better than I do .
ELIZABETH: Well , you are my tenth Prime Minister , Mr Blair . I 'd like to think there were n't too many surprises left . My first was Winston Churchill . He sat in your chair , in frock coat and top hat , and was kind enough to give a shy
TONY: I can imagine .
ELIZABETH: ith time , one has hopefully added experience to that education , and a little wisdom - better enabling us to execute our constitutional esponsibility . To advise , guide and warn the government of the day .
TONY: Advice which I look forward to eceiving .
ELIZABETH: ell , we will save that for our weekly meetings . a beat ) Now , if there 's nothing else , I elieve we have some business to attend to..
TONY: Of course..
ELIZABETH: No , no , no . It 's usual for ME to ask the questions .
TONY: ` Yes ' .
HERIE: Yes .
ELIZABETH: And exhausted , I imagine . Where will you be spending the summer ?

TONY: ou 'll be in Balmoral , I expect .
ELIZABETH: Yes , I can hardly wait . Wonderful place .
CHERIE: `` Thank you so much for coming . Now ugger off . ''
TONY: I know . What was all that about ?
CHERIE: Diana . Apparently she 's got a new oyfriend .

QUEEN MOTHER: You can use the Royal Flight . They keep one of the planes on permanent stand-by . deadpans ) In case I kick the bucket .
ELIZABETH: Out of the question . It 's not a matte of State .
HARLES: What are you talking about ?
ELIZABETH: Diana is no longer an HRH , nor a member of the Royal Family . This is a private matter .
CHARLES: She 's mother to your grandchildren .
QUEEN MOTHER: That 's the latest ?
PRINCE PHILIP: I do n't know . I ca n't hear.. Everyone 's shouting !
TELEVISION: ..behind me , is the tunnel of the Pont de l'Alma , which you reach by the expressway along the Seine . It was along here that the Mercedes carrying the Princess..

ALASTAIR: You 'll be pleased to know I 've already started coming up with ideas .

ALASTAIR: Would you prefer I did n't do my job ?
CHARLES: They 're going to go back to sleep . Well , try anyway .
ELIZABETH: All right .
PRINCE PHILIP: Well , well , well .
ELIZABETH: Ye-es .
PRINCE PHILIP: Are you all right ?
ELIZABETH: hope you told her to come back ? Cut the holiday short ?
PRINCE PHILIP: I did .
ELIZABETH: a n't imagine she was pleased .
PRINCE PHILIP: That 's putting it mildly .
ELIZABETH: What did she say ?
PRINCE PHILIP: Something about Diana managing to be even more annoying dead than alive .
ELIZABETH: Just make sure the boys never hear you talk like that .
PRINCE PHILIP: Of course .
ELIZABETH: No . I 'm going to do my diary a little longer .
PRINCE PHILIP: Fine . I 'll sleep next door .
TONY: `` ..that 's how she will remain . In ou minds , our hearts , forever . '' OK , got it .
ALASTAIR: Where will you do it ?
TONY: I thought at church . On the way in .
ALASTAIR: Not the press , mate . You 've got the wrong villain .
TONY: I 've got to go .
ALASTAIR: You about to speak to the Queen ?
TONY: Yes .
ALASTAIR: Ask her if SHE greased the brakes .
TONY: Now , now..
JANVRIN: I 'm sorry to disturb , Ma'am , but I 've the Prime Minister , for you . From his constituency .
QUEEN MOTHER: Lucky you .
ELIZABETH: Thank you , Robin . I 'll take it next door .
TONY: Good morning , your Majesty . May I say ight away how very sorry I am - and that the thoughts and prayers of my family are with you at this terrible time and with the two princes in particular .
ELIZABETH: Thank you .
TONY: Is it your intention to make some kind of appearance . Or statement ?
ELIZABETH: Certainly not .
TONY: I see .
ELIZABETH: We 've spoken to the Spencer family , and it 's their wish.. ..their express wish , that it should e a private funeral . With a memorial service to follow in a month , or so .
TONY: Right .
ELIZABETH: Given that Diana was no longer a member of the Royal Family we have no choice but to respect their wishes .
TONY: I see .
ELIZABETH: As I said . That 's the Spencers ' wish .
TONY: You do n't think a private funeral would be denying them a chance..
ELIZABETH: hance to what.. ?
TONY: To share in the grief ?
ELIZABETH: It 's a family funeral , Mr. Blair . Not a fairground attraction . I think the Princess has already paid a high enough price for exposure to the press , do n't you ?
TONY: Of course .
CHERIE: Are you surprised ? She hated her guts .
TONY: Well , I think it 's a mistake .
ELIZABETH: The Chaplain called . Wanted to know whether he should make any changes to the service or make special mention of Diana .
PRINCE PHILIP: What did you say ?
ELIZABETH: I told him he should n't change a thing .
UEEN MOTHER: Q uite right .
ELIZABETH: I think the less fuss one makes , o draws attention to it , the better . she lowers her voice , as the PRINCES approach from the saloon with CHARLES ) For the boys .
QUEEN MOTHER: Yes .
ELIZABETH: And we should probably arrange some company for them . Some young people .
PRINCE PHILIP: I 'll take them for a long walk this afternoon . Up Craggy Head .
ELIZABETH: Good . They 'd like that .
AIDE: Alastair ? He 's on..
TONY: e are today a nation in a state of shock , in mourning , in grief that is so deeply painful to us . People everywhere , not just here in Britain , kept faith with Princess Diana..

IDE: Lord Airlie .
IDE: The Lord Chamberlain . In charge of the funeral . You 're meeting him at the airport .
TONY: Lord Airlie .
AIRLIE: Prime Minister . I 'm responsible fo organising all royal ceremonial events And there 's simply no precedent fo the funeral of an ex-HRH .
TONY: Then perhaps we should plan for any contingency .
ORD AIRLIE: Yes . I 've arranged a meeting tomorrow morning at 10.00 at Buckingham Palace . Officials from all three palaces , epresentatives from the Spence Family , the emergency services . a beat ) Would you send some of your people ?
TONY: Absolutely . Of course .
CHARLES: They stood up as we drove pastin cafesin restaurants . Removed thei hats . This was Paris . One of the usiest cities in the worldand you could hear a pin drop
TONY: I imagine it will be the same here .
CHARLES: YesI imagine it will .
TONY: I I think that would present us with difficulties .
TONY: I think I understand .
ELIZABETH: Have we heard from the Spencers again ? Have they made up their minds when the funeral will be ?
QUEEN MOTHER: Not me . No one tells me anything .
PRINCE PHILIP: n our walk today , one of the ghillies said he 'd seen a large stag up at Craghie Head . a beat ) He reckoned fourteen points .
QUEEN MOTHER: What ? Really ? We have n't had one that ig on this estate in years .

ANVRIN: ndeed , Ma'am . But it would be for practical reasons only .
QUEEN MOTHER: But I supervised those plans myself .
JANVRIN: Indeed , and the Lord Chamberlain was at pains to stress the spirit of the occasion will be quite different . a beat ) For example , in place of four hundred soldiers marching behind the coffin , the suggestion is that four hundred epresentatives from the Princess 's various charities march behind the coffin .
ELIZABETH: I see..
JANVRIN: And that instead of foreign Heads of State and Crown heads of Europe , the guests would include a sprinkling of actors of stage and screen , fashion designers and other.. celebrities..
QUEEN MOTHER: Celebrities.. ?
ELIZABETH: Oh .
JANVRIN: o , Ma'am .
ELIZABETH: Yes , of course..
JANVRIN: Oh , and the flowers .
ELIZABETH: W hat flowers ?
JANVRIN: Actually , the Lord Chamberlain was wondering whether we should n't leave the flowers , and send the Guards through the North Gate .
ELIZABETH: Ye-es . Of course . chastened ) Quite right .
AIDE: tephen Lamport on one .
TONY: Who ?
AIDE: The Prince of Wales 's private secretary . In Balmoral . covering phone ) He said it was urgent .
TONY: ood afternoon .
LAMPORT: The Prince of Wales wanted me to thank you again for your kind words yesterday .
TONY: Not at all .
AMPORT: He feels you and heare modern menof similar mind who could work well together at this difficult time .
TONY: Well , please thank his Highness , and assure him that he can count on my full support . At all times . Was that it ?
LAMPORT: Yes .
AIDE: What ?
TONY: Creeping up to me like this . He did it at the airport when he asked me to ` deal ' with his mother .
AIDE #2: ecause he knows that if the Queen continues to get it wrong over Diana , it wo n't be long before the Royals ecome public enemy no 1 .
TONY: Who , Charles ?
AIDE: His people have already been onto us asking for extra protection .
IDE #2: He probably thinks if he 's seen to be on our side , the Queen will be the one left in the firing line , not him .
TONY: What ? So it 's OK for his mother to take the bullet , not him ? shakes head ) What a family .
CHARLES: Wait ! Where are they ?
ELIZABETH: Up at Craigghead .
CHARLES: I 'll come with you .
ELIZABETH: Certainly not .
CHARLES: I thought you were going to get a new
ELIZABETH: What for ? It 's perfectly all right .
CHARLES: I was thinking last night what Diana might have done had it been me that died in the tunnel in Paris .
ELIZABETH: What ? And expose them to the media ? It would have been a dreadful thing to do . They 're much better off here .
CHARLES: Look , whatever else you may have thought of Diana - she was a wonderful mother . a beat ) She adored those boys . And never let them forget it . a beat ) Always warm .
ELIZABETH: Especially whenever a photographer was in sight .
CHARLES: Yes , she MAY have encouraged all that , ut still..
ELIZABETH: Not ` us ' , dear .
CHARLES: What ?
CHARLES: Are you sure ?
ELIZABETH: Yes . It looks like rain.. And I 'm not in the mood for stalking anyway .
PRINCE PHILIP: What did he say ?
ELIZABETH: How wonderful Diana was .
RINCE PHILIP: That 's changing his tune .
ELIZABETH: What a natural .
PRINCE PHILIP: Oh , for God 's sake..
ELIZABETH: Maybe he 's got a point . Maybe we are partly to blame .
PRINCE PHILIP: I ca n't watch this .
ELIZABETH: No , wait . Leave it .
RINCE PHILIP: She was a nice girl . Then .
PRINCE PHILIP: And I was sure he 'd give the other one up . Or , at least make sure his wife towed the line . Is n't that what everyone does ?
ELIZABETH: Is it ?
TONY: W hat ?
HERIE: ..I do n't knowsomething more interesting . Maybe this time people have finally seen them for what they are .
TONY: Which is ?
CHERIE: A bunch of freeloading , emotionally etardednutters .
TONY: That 's just absurd .
CHERIE: Why ? They exist in a ludicrous cocoon of privilege and wealth . They do n't pay tax .
TONY: Yes , they do .
CHERIE: The Queen alone costs us what ? Thirty , forty million a year..
TONY: ot you , too . Lookif you want to have a serious conversation about this..
CHERIE: I do..
TONY: ..about the Constitution..
CHERIE: e do n't HAVE one..
TONY: or about ways in which we as a Government could begin to phase out hereditary privileges , then fine .
HERIE: If you 're going , take the dishes..
TONY: But spare me the whole.. '' off with their heads '' thing .
CHERIE: Why ?
TONY: Because it insults your intelligence .
CHERIE: `` The case for reform is simple and obvious . It is in principle wrong and absurd that people should wield powe on the basis of birth , not merit o election . '' YOUR words , not mine .
TONY: Well , maybe now I 've grown up . a beat ) It 's unimaginable this country being a epublic . Certainly in her lifetime .
CHERIE: Why ?
TONY: Becauseno would would wear it . No one WANTS it . It 's justdaft .
HERIE: It 's not a mother thing , is it ?
CHERIE: Think about it . If she were still alive , would n't Hazel be exactly the same age ? Whenever you talk about you mother , you mention her stoicism . He frugality . Her sense of duty . The fact she was brought up in the way . Well c'mon.. ? Who does THAT sound like ?
TONY: I 'm going to do the washing-up . F
ALASTAIR: All right , the good news is that the Palace has agreed to video screens in the Royal Parks .
TONY: And the bad news ?
ALASTAIR: Crash barriers .
TONY: What about them ?
ALASTAIR: hey 're now predicting more than two million people will descend on London , and there are n't enough barriers to line the route . So we 've gone cap in hand to the French for theirs . And there 's something else I think you should see .
ALASTAIR: Can we run that piece again ? You 're going to love this .
TONY: Look , I know all this..
ALASTAIR: There !
TONY: Do n't tell me . There is n't a flag flying at half mast above Buckingham Palace .
ALASTAIR: ` Planet Zog ' ?
TONY: Because as Prime Minister of this country , I 've really got nothing etter to do..
ELIZABETH: Those fire-lighters no good ? carrying tupperware oxes ) I brought some stew just in case . I think it 's lamb . We could always have that cold..
PRINCE PHILIP: No , we 'll be all right .
ELIZABETH: Robin had a call from the Prime Minister . Who expressed his concern .
PRINCE PHILIP: About WHAT ?
ELIZABETH: The flag above Buckingham Palace . He thinks it should be flying at half- mast .
RINCE PHILIP: Then I hope Robin told him there IS N'T a flag above Buckingham Palace only the Royal Standard , which flies for one reason only .
CHARLES: Is n't it possible..that to some peoplethe Royal Standard is just.. ..a flag ? And that the flap pole being are sends out the wrong signal .
ELIZABETH: That 's not the point .
RINCE PHILIP: The point is it 's more than fou hundred years old . It has never been lowered for ANYONE..
QUEEN MOTHER: Your grandfather did n't get that flag at half-mast when he died and if you mother were to die tomorrow , she would n't get it either .
CHARLES: Yesbut sometimesin a situation like this..one has to be flexible..
ELIZABETH: `` What about the Union Jack ? `` , was Mr. Blair 's next suggestion .
UEEN MOTHER: Oh , for heaven 's sake .
PRINCE PHILIP: The next thing he 'll be suggesting you change your name to Hilda and mine to Hector ?
ELIZABETH: Like those condolence books .
PRINCE PHILIP: Quite right . When we started with one , everyone predicted they would grow and grow . But we 've heard nothing more about that , see ?
CHARLES: Apparently there are now fifteen .
ELIZABETH: What.. ?
CHARLES: And people are queuing through the night .
HARLES: In one sense its comforting . a beat ) For the first time my parents can see what it 's been like for me all these years , being up against he popularity . But they 're still making the mistake of thinking the Diana they knew from living and dealing with her , will eventually be the one seen by the public . But it 's not . The two Dianas , theirs and ours , bear no relation to one another at all .
CHARLES: I 've been thinking is the flag flying at half mast over my house at Highgrove ?
LAMPORT: Yes , Sir .
CHARLES: Make sure we get a picture of that in the papers , would you ? If my mothe wants to make a mess of this , that 's her business . a beat ) I wo n't let her drag me down , too .
HERIE: See ? It is n't just me .
TONY: What ?
CHERIE: People really DO want change . And want YOU to give it to them .
TONY: And do what ? Cut off their heads ?
HERIE: Apparently , one in six people now support the idea of getting rid of the Monarchy .
TONY: That 's just the papers spoiling for a fight .
CHERIE: But still , imagine this country without them ? With a nice elected Head of State ? a beat ) That 'd be some legacy . If the evolution were to happen on you watch .
ANVRIN: That 's the stalking party off ?
JANVRIN: Right , we 'd better have a look at these papers .
SECRETARY: It proves , the Royals are not like us '' , the Mirror . `` Time to change the Old Guard at Buckingham Palace '' . Express .
JANVRIN: God..
SECRETARY: `` One ca n't help wondering who 's advice they are taking for it 's clearly the wrong advice ''
JANVRIN: Right
TONY: `` People have been yearning for a change in this country . '' Good . `` The esult is a quiet revolution now taking place . Led by the real modernisers . The British People.. ''
TONY: ` Revolution ' ? Not you , too ? tails off ) Who wrote this ?
AIDE: Where does it come from ?
IDE 2: Just look at the papers . Talk to people on the streets .
IDE: Something 's happening out there .
TONY: Revolution .
AIDE: What about the speech ?
TONY: Later .
PRINCE PHILIP: Hurry up , dear . Getting cold .
JANVRIN: Yes , Ma'am . Just the letter of condolence to the widow of the Ambassador to Brazil .
ELIZABETH: Good .
JANVRIN: Ma'am , apparently the Prime Ministe is on the phone for you .
RINCE PHILIP: Tell him to call back .
ELIZABETH: No , I 'd better take it .
TONY: Good afternoon , your Majesty . I 'm sorry to disturb . I was just wondering..
ELIZABETH: We 've managed to look at one or two , yes .
TONY: In which case , my next question would e - whether you felt some kind of esponse might be necessary ?
RINCE PHILIP: Here we go ! The bloody flag again.. !
TONY: ..my advisers have been taking the temperature among people on the streets - and the information I 'm getting is that the mood.. is quite delicate .
PRINCE PHILIP: Of course . That 's where all the ruddy cameras are .
ELIZABETH: So what would you suggest , Prime Minister ? Some kind of statement ?
TONY: No , Ma'am . I believe the moment fo statements has passed .
PRINCE PHILIP: See !
TONY: And coming down to London at the earliest opportunity .
ELIZABETH: THEIR grief ?
RINCE PHILIP: Absurd.. E
ELIZABETH: I doubt there are many who know the British more than I do , Mr. Blair , no who has greater faith in their wisdom and judgement . And it is my belief that they will soon reject this ` mood ' which has been stirred up by the pressin favour of a period of estrained grief , and sober , private mourning . a beat ) That 's the way we do things in this country . Quietly . With dignity . It 's what the rest of the world has always admired us for .
TONY: Well , if that 's your decision , Ma'am , of course the government will support it .
ELIZABETH: Yes . could hardly be less enthusiastic ) Let 's .
PRINCE PHILIP: Bloody fool .
SECRETARY: Robin Janvrin on one . a beat ) He must have been listening in .
TONY: Mr Janvrin ?
JANVRIN: Prime Minister , I understand how ` difficult ' her behaviour must seem to you..how ` unhelpful'..but try to see it from her perspective.. She 's been brought up to believe its God 's will that she is who she is .
TONY: I think we should leave God out of it . It 's just not helpful .
JANVRIN: She wo n't have seen anything like this since the Abdication . a beat )
TONY: All right - but first we have to deal with these terrible headlines . I 'll see what I can do with the Press .
JANVRIN: I 'm most grateful , Prime Minister .
TONY: But I ca n't promise anything . It 's not me they want to see .
ELIZABETH: Oh..
HEAD GHILLIE: Are you sure , Ma'am ?
ELIZABETH: Yes , perfectly . The front one , not the ear . I 've lost the four-wheel drive . You forget I worked as a mechanic in the war .
HEAD GHILLIE: And are you all right ?
ELIZABETH: Yes , perfectly , thank you . I 'm so sorry to waste your time..
HEAD GHILIE: We 'll come out straightaway .
ELIZABETH: Oh , will you ? You are kind . Thank you . a beat ) I 'll wait by the car .
ELIZABETH: Oh , you are a beauty .
CHERIE: I 've just been told there are news crews outside waiting for you to come and `` speak to the people . ''
TONY: Yes .
HERIE: What 's that about ?
TONY: I told the Queen 's private secretary I 'd do what I could to help with the press .
CHERIE: Why ? Do n't you think she deserves it ? Sitting up there on her 40,000 acres .
TONY: I knowbut allowing her to hang herself might not be in our best interests either .
V PRESENTER: ..earlier tonight the Prime Ministe went out and pleaded with people to understand the Royals ' behaviour..
ELIZABETH: How are the boys ?
PRINCE PHILIP: Not so good tonight . A lot of slamming doors . I think they saw the papers .
ELIZABETH: Oh , no..
PRINCE PHILIP: I 'll take them out early again tomorrow morning .
RINCE PHILIP: What ?
PRINCE PHILIP: and a hysteric .
ELIZABETH: No .
PRINCE PHILIP: I suggest you keep it that way . A chorus line of soap stars and homosexuals .
PRINCE PHILIP: That 'll be a first for Westminste Abbey .
RINCE PHILIP: So it 's VITAL you hold firm . Stick to your guns . You wait . They will come to their senses soon . a beat ) They HAVE to .
PRINCE PHILIP: C'mon , move over , Cabbage .
ELEVISION PRESENTER: It 's six o'clock . Time for a look at the morning 's newspapers . Jenny..
JENNY: Good morning . Well if you thought yesterday 's headlines for the Royals could n't get any worse - think again .
LASTAIR: Blimey ! But the flip-side is `` Blair more popular than Churchill shock . ''
TONY: Did any of them pick up on ou statement of support ?
ALASTAIR: Just one .
TONY: Right..
ANVRIN: The Prime Minister for you , Ma'am .
JANVRIN: I 'm afraid he 's rather insisting .
ELIZABETH: All right . I 'll take it here . a beat ) In the kitchens .
ELIZABETH: Yes , I have .
TONY: Then I 'm sure you 'll agree . The situation has become quite critical .
ELIZABETH: Is Queen Elizabeth up yet ?
QUEEN MOTHER: bviously you 're going to have to talk to the Lord Chamberlain about all this .
ELIZABETH: I have .
UEEN MOTHER: And to Robert Fellowes .
ELIZABETH: To him too .
UEEN MOTHER: And.. ?
QUEEN MOTHER: I see .
ELIZABETH: Something 's happened . There 's been a changea shift of values..
QUEEN MOTHER: Certainly not ! Remember the oath you took
ELIZABETH: `` I declare that my whole life , whethe it be long or short , shall be devoted to your service . ''
QUEEN MOTHER: Your WHOLE life . That 's a commitment to God as well as your people .
ELIZABETH: But if my actions are damaging the crown ?
QUEEN MOTHER: Damaging them ? My dear , you are the greatest asset this institution has . One of the greatest it has EVER had . The problem will come when you leave , ut that 's not for you to worry about - and certainly not today .
ELIZABETH: Mummy..
QUEEN MOTHER: And you 're not like that . Never have een . Noyou must show strength . Re- assert your authority . You sit on the most powerful throne in Europe . Head of an unbroken line that goes back more than a thousand years . How many of your predecessors do you imagine would have dropped everything and gone down to London because people holding candles wanted help with their grief ?
UEEN MOTHER: And as for Mr Blair and his Cheshire Cat grin
GHILLIE: Mr Janvrin for you sir .
PRINCE PHILIP: Yes Robin . ?
CHARLES: I 've just been told . You 've decided to go back to London .
CHARLES: I just want to say - I admire I think it 's the right decision .
TONY: Thank God for that .
CHERIE: I 'm afraid they 're a bit burned .
RINCE PHILIP: Where are the boys ? Have they already left ?
ELIZABETH: Yes . They left for London afte eakfast . With Charles .
PRINCE PHILIP: It 's not right , you know
ELIZABETH: Yes , but further discussion is no longer helpful either .
PRINCE PHILIP: Oh , well . I suppose it gives the ghillies time to find a new stag fo the boys now theirs has been shot .
ELIZABETH: What ?
PRINCE PHILIP: Have n't you heard ? It wandered onto one of the neighbouring estates where it was shot by one of the commercial guests .
ELIZABETH: Really.. ?
CAMPBELL: Here 's your box . There 's some
TONY: I 'm the Prime Minister . Of course I 've seen the papers .
LASTAIR: `` Your Maj ? Come down to London . '' `` Who says so ? '' `` Tony Blair . ''
ALASTAIR: `` Mr. Father of the Nation . ''
HEAD GILLIE: Morning , Ma'am . Is it his Lordship you 've come to see ?
ELIZABETH: No , no..please do n't disturb him . I 've come on another matter . I hope you do n't mind..
HEAD GILLIE: There he is..
ELIZABETH: e was wounded .
HEAD GILLIE: Yes . We got our guest in very close , had him lined-up perfect , and still.. shrugs apologetically ) ..an investment banker , Ma'am . From London .
ELIZABETH: voice cracks ) Let 's hope he did n't suffer too much .
HEAD GILLIE: I will , Ma'am .
ELIZABETH: Yes , Robin..
JANVRIN: I 've done a draft of your television address .
ELIZABETH: Thank you .
JANVRIN: No , Ma'am . Landing in fifteen minutes .
SECRETARY: I 've got a copy of the Queen 's speech .
LASTAIR: Let me have a look at it first .
PRINCE PHILIP: Good God..
ALASTAIR: They sent a copy of the Queen 's speech .
TONY: You know when you get it wrong , you REALLY get it wrong . a beat ) That woman has given her whole life in service to her people - fifty years doing a job she NEVER wanted - a jo she watched kill her father . She 's executed it with dignity , honour and , as far as I can tell , without a single lemish - and now we line up baying for her blood - why ? Because she 's struggling to lead the world in mourning for a woman who threw everything she offered back in he face , and who seemed , in the last few years , to be committed twenty-fou seven to destroy everything she holds dear . TONY storms off .
ELIZABETH: Oh..hello .
LITTLE GIRL: No .
ELIZABETH: Oh .
LITTLE GIRL: They 're for you .
ELIZABETH: For me.. ?
ANVRIN: Your Majesty , there 's a last minute addition from Downing Street . They 're suggesting adding ` ..and as a grandmother.. ' here .
ELIZABETH: Right .
JANVRIN: You think you can say it ?
ELIZABETH: Do I have a choice ?
IRECTOR: We 're ready for you , your Majesty..
DIRECTOR: Just to confirm this is going out live .
ELIZABETH: Right
DIRECTOR: And you 'll be at the front of the six o'clock news on all the channels
ELIZABETH: I see .
FLOOR MANAGER: Ten seconds , everyone..
ELIZABETH: Since last Saturday 's dreadful news we have seen , throughout Britain and the world , an overwhelming expression of sadness at Diana 's death..
ELIZABETH: We have all been trying in ou different ways to cope . The initial shock is often succeeded by a mixture of other feelings . Disbelief , incomprehension , anger and concern fo those who remain .
CHERIE: `` Heart '' ? What `` heart '' . She does n't mean a word of this .
TONY: That 's not the point . What she 's doing is extraordinary . That 's how you survive .
CHERIE: Listen to you ! A week ago you were the great moderniser , making speeches about the `` People 's Princess '' , now you 've gone weak at the knees .
DIRECTOR: And we 're out.. !
CHERIE: So ? Off to see your girlfriend ?
TONY: Now , now..
CHERIE: I hope she shows you some respect this time . It 's quite a debt of gratitude she owes you .
TONY: doubt she 'll see it that way .
JANVRIN: Prime Minister .
TONY: Tony , please..
EQUERRY: The Prime Minister , Ma'am .
ELIZABETH: Do sit down .
TONY: Thank you .
TONY: I meant to tell you at the time but you were being monopolised rather .
ELIZABETH: Whatever for ?
TONY: In case you 'd felt ` manhandled ' o ` managed ' in any way .
ELIZABETH: Not at all .
TONY: The circumstances were exceptional , Ma'am . And in the end , you showed great personal strength , courage , and humility . E
ELIZABETH: ou 're confusing humility with humiliation .
TONY: That 's not true .
ELIZABETH: You did n't hear what they were saying in the Mall that Friday .
TONY: I still believe History will show it was a good week for you .
ELIZABETH: And an even better one for you , M Blair .
TONY: But there are fifty-two weeks in a year , Ma'am . And two and a half thousand in a half century .
ELIZABETH: Really ?
TONY: Not at all .
ELIZABETH: I gather some of your closest advisors were less fulsome in their support..
TONY: One or two . But as a leader one hasa different perspective . a beat ) I could never have added my voice to the chorus .
ELIZABETH: You 're very kind .
TONY: Which is ?
ELIZABETH: That without me there to distract everyone , it 'd suddenly become embarrassingly clear how much unchecked power the British Prime Minister actually has .
TONY: I am .
ELIZABETH: Good . The clocks go back next week , then it 'll be dark by five .
TONY: For about half an hour . But then you came down to London and all that went away .
ELIZABETH: I 've never been hated like that efore .
TONY: No . And that must have been difficult .
ELIZABETH: It was . Very .
TONY: One forgets . You were so young when you became Queen .
ELIZABETH: I was . A girl .
TONY: Well , perhaps that 's where I can help .
ELIZABETH: Do n't get ahead of yourself Prime- minister , I think you 'll find that I 'm supposed to be advising YOU !
TONY: Well , Ma'am , top of the list is education reform . We want to radically educe classroom sizes
