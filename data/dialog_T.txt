DOCTOR SHANNAN: Why do you say that ?

SOFTLY: Shit .
ATTENDANT: Dr. Furtwängler , the Reichsminister .
REICHSMINISTER: Dr. Furtwängler , I want to apologise personally for this power failure . I was so enjoying the performance . In times like these we need spiritual nourishment . A bomb explodes nearby .
WALLACE: So , you never heard of him .
STEVE: Nope .
WALLACE: Do you know who Arturo Toscanini is ?
STEVE: Sure .
WALLACE: He 's as big as Toscanini , maybe even bigger . In this neck of the woods , he 's probably Bob Hope and Betty Grable rolled into one .
STEVE: Jeez , and I never heard of him . Wallace glances at the file .
WALLACE: You were in insurance before the war .
STEVE: Right . Claims assessor .
WALLACE: Conscientious , determined , dogged .
STEVE: They said I was dogged ?
WALLACE: Well , they say here that when you went on a case , you stayed on it . Now we ca n't take every Nazi in this country to trial , although I would like to ; it 's an impossibility . So we 're going fo the big boys in industry , education , law , culture .
STEVE: Like this bandleader .
WALLACE: Well , he 's more than just a andleader , Steve . He 's a great conductor , a gifted artist . But we elieve that he sold himself to the devil . Your number one priority from this moment on is to connect him to the Nazi Party . Do n't be impressed by him . I want the folks ack home to understand why we fought this war . Find Wilhelm Furtwängler guilty . He represents everything that was rotten in Germany .
PROJECTIONIST: Yes , sir . Roll it .
WALLACE: Next reel , please .

EMMI: My father was one of the officers in the plot against Hitler . They arrested the plotters and thei families .
STEVE: Your mother , too .
EMMI: Yes . She suffered longer . She was in Ravensbruck .
STEVE: And your father was executed .
ADAMS: If you need anything , let me know .
EMMI: Major
STEVE: Steve .
EMMI: There have been messages for you . A Lieutenant David Wills called from the Allied Kommandatura Cultural Affairs office in Wiesbaden . I do n't know who he is . Steve starts to unpack his attache case .
STEVE: Think you can get me any of that ?
EMMI: Oh yes , Major , I have recordings of all his symphonies . I kept them safe during the bombing . My favourite is the Seventh Symphony .
STEVE: Mine 's the Eleventh .
EMMI: But he only wrote nine , Major .
STEVE: I 'm kidding , Emmi . What about a ecord player ? You have that , too ?
EMMI: No . Ours was damaged .
STEVE: What 's in those files ?
EMMI: The names of the members of the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra since 1934 together with thei questionnaires . Major , what am I to tell Dr. Furtwängler ?
STEVE: You tell him nothing , Emmi . If he calls again , you say you know nothing . We 're gon na keep him waiting while I get acquainted with his case and with the witnesses . And , God help me , with Beethoven . He smiles . She tries to smile back .
DAVID: Lieutenant Wills reporting to Majo Arnold . Sir .
STEVE: For Chrissakes I hate that shit , cut it out .
DAVID: I 'm very sorry .
STEVE: I 'm Steve . What 's your name ?
DAVID: David . David Wills . I 'm your liaison officer with the Allied Kommandatura Cultural Affairs Committee . Sir .
STEVE: Sounds a lot of run . So they sent the big guns to check up on me . We recruiting children now ?
DAVID: I guess so , sir .
STEVE: You call me sir again and I 'll make you listen to Beethoven . David half-smiles .
DAVID: was born here , in Leipzig . I escaped in '36 . My parents , they sent me to my uncle in Philadelphia . They were to follow . But they delayed and Breaks off . Nothing from Steve .
EMMI: I 'm sorry .
STEVE: Come in , Emmi , this is your office , too . Emmi , this is Lieutenant David Wills . They nod briefly .
DAVID: Some .
STEVE: Do n't . This is like a criminal investigation , David . Musicians , morticians , doctors , lawyers , utchers , clerks . They 're all the same .
EMMI: It works ! Hallelujah !
STEVE: Sit down , Werner . Indicates the upright chair ; Werner sits .
WERNER: First oboe .
STEVE: I have your questionnaire here . It says you were never a member of the Nazi Party .
WERNER: Absolutely not .
STEVE: Hey , hey , slow up , Fraulein Straube has to take down what you say . Werner swivels round to look at Emmi .
WERNER: Straube ? Any relation to Colonel Joachim Straube ?
EMMI: My father .
WERNER: It 's a great honour to meet you , Fraulein . Your father was a great patriot . Brief silence .
STEVE: Then how do you explain him being made a Prussian Privy Councillor ?
WERNER: It was Hermann Goering . I was told he just made the maestro his Privy Councillor , no questions asked . Although Dr. Furtwängler stood up to him . And to Dr. Goebbels .
STEVE: He also conducted for Hitler , did n't he ?
WERNER: Yes , that 's true , but he refused to give the Nazi salute . He kept his baton in his right hand . In Hitler 's presence . That was a brave act
STEVE: Brave ? To celebrate Hitler 's irthday with some heroic piece by Wagner but without the Nazi salute ? Bravo .
WERNER: It was Beethoven 's Ninth .
STEVE: Do you really think it was brave ? Did n't he bow to him and shake his hand ?
SCHLEE: No , no , no , I give you my word . I was never a member of the Nazi Party . Never . I am in the percussion section . I play the timpani . Steve just stares at him .
EMMI: Straube .
SCHLEE: Straube ? Are you by any chance elated to Colonel Joachim Straube ?
EMMI: My father .
SCHLEE: He was he was a great hero . Steve lights a cigarette .
STEVE: But this was the same guy who conducted for Adolf on his birthday .
SCHLEE: He was forced to do that . But he efused to give the Nazi salute in front of Hitler . He kept his baton in his hand , you ca n't salute with a baton in your hand .
DAVID: And what about the Nuremberg Rally ?
SCHLEE: No , wewe played on the evening efore the Rally .
STEVE: Oh ! The evening before , I see
SCHLEE: Yes , Dr. Furtwängler was absolutely clear about this politics and art must be kept separate .
STEVE: Politics and art must be kept separate . I 'll remember that . But let me see if you can help me with something I just do n't understand . I 'd really like to know why all you guys are so crazy about him . What 's his secret ? Schlee tries to find words .
SCHLEE: Well , it 's hard to explain . I can only tell you from my own experience . Soon after I joined the orchestra , we were rehearsing the Third Symphony of Beethoven , the Eroica . There are several rathe difficult passages for the timpani . One particular crescendo . During the break , I asked how he wanted it played . He was studying his score . He did n't look up . He said , 'Just watch me . ' So , of course , I did . I never stopped watching him . The moment came . And suddenly , he turned to me and our eyes were locked . There was something in his look that that simply demanded the crescendo . I shall never forget his look . It was a moment of of magic . Steve nods , thinks for a moment . Then
STEVE: You ever seen Adolf Hitler 's eyes when he was making a speech ? I 've seen 'em on films .
SCHLEE: Yes .
STEVE: Was looking at Furtwängler like that ?
SCHLEE: I do n't know what you mean , Major .
STEVE: When you got to the crescendo . Schlee looks at him bewildered .
DAVID: I guess it 's possible .
STEVE: So , what does the Russki want ?
DAVID: Colonel Dymshitz asked specially to see you .
STEVE: 'Dim-shits ' ?
DAVID: They 're trying to sort out some of the works of art the Nazis stole from occupied territories . Who eally owns what ? That 's Colonel Dymshitz , on the far side .
DAVID'S VOICE: art historian , head of the famous Leningrad Museum of Art . He is an expert on German culture .
VERNAY: Je suis navré , Colonel , cette peinture n'est pas la propriété de I'union soviétique mats bien cette de la France .
GREEN: What 's he saying ? Henri , what is you saying ?
AMERICAN AIDE: He 's saying that picture is the property of France
VERNAY: C'est un Braque qui avec Picasso était un des pionniers du cubisme .
DYMSHITZ: I know who Georges Braque is , Captain .
AMERICAN AIDE: It 's a Barque .
FRENCH AIDE: We can produce the provenance of this Braque , you say provenance ?
DYMSHITZ: Hello , Major , my name is Dymshitz . I 'm glad to see you .
STEVE: Colonel . Pleasure .
DYMSHITZ: So , Major , tell me , have you questioned Dr. Furtwängler ?
STEVE: Not yet .
DYMSHITZ: I 've had two meetings with him . He 's a great musician . Maybe the greatest conductor in the world . His Brahms , Beethoven , Schubert - unequalled . Steve makes a non-committal gesture .
GREEN: Hey , just a moment , you should have discussed this with me first .
DYMSHITZ: I 'm discussing it with you now . Major , I want you to drop you investigation , save everybody time and trouble .
GREEN: We ca n't drop a case just like that .
DYMSHITZ: I 'll give you another conductor in exchange or writer , musician , acto whatwhat do you care ? But I like Furtwängler . He 's my favourite conductor . Mine and Hitler 's . He 's ou favourite conductor .
DAVID: I clicked my heels , saluted and owed at the same time . He demonstrates . She laughs again .
EMMI: That 's because you had a prope upbringing .
DAVID: That 's right . I was raised very strictly . So do n't speak before you are spoken to !
EMMI: Oh ! And do n't wave your hands about !
DAVID: Respect your elders and you etters !
EMMI: And no elbows on the table !
DAVID: Eating is eating and
EMMI: And talking is talking ! Well , I think we better get on .
DAVID: Right . So , this is going to be very formal , too , now . Lieutenant David Wills requests die pleasure of die company of Fraulein Emmi Straube at dinner any night she cares .
STEVE: David , need to ask you something . You heard this rumour the British found something called the Hinkel Archive ?
DAVID: Yes .
STEVE: So what is it ?
DAVID: The British occupy the building where this guy , Hinkel , ran the Nazi Ministry of Culture and it seems they 've they 've discovered his secret archive .
STEVE: What 's that mean ?
DAVID: I do n't know , but the British are excited about it , I know that . The umour is Hinkel kept a file on every artist working in the Third Reich .
STEVE: Jeez . And you think the British 'll share it with their Allies ?
DAVID: Major Richards said he 'd call to let us know .
STEVE: That 's big of him .
DAVID: Five minutes .
STEVE: It 's a bet . You 're the witness , Emmi . Later .
RODE: It means I was n't good enough to e a first violinist .
STEVE: Good , and according to you questionnaire , Helmuth , you neve joined the Nazi Party .
RODE: Me ? Never . Never . Long silence .
STEVE: I 'll ask the questions , Helmuth .
RODE: Excuse me . Did you know that he efused to give the Nazi salute when Hitler was present in the audience ?
EMMI: Straube . Steve and David exchange a brief look .
RODE: Straube . Any relation to Colonel Joachim Straube ?
EMMI: My father .
RODE: I am deeply honoured to be in you presence , Fraulein Straube . You father was a true patriot , a man of God .
STEVE: You have a question for Helmuth , David ?
DAVID: Yes . What was the orchestra 's eaction when they asked you to play for Hitler 's birthday ?
RODE: Oh , we did n't play for his birthday , we played the evening before - it was the 19th of April not the 20th .
STEVE: Do you know Hans Hinkel ?
RODE: Do I know Hans Hinkel ?
STEVE: That 's what I asked .
RODE: Do I know Hans Hinkel ?
STEVE: You seem to understand the question , now how about answering it ?
RODE: Hans Hinkel was in the Ministry of Culture ; how could I know such a man ? I Brief silence ; a smile .
STEVE: Do you know what 's in this archive ?
RODE: How could I know what 's in the archive ? Steve nods , smiles .
STEVE: Okay , you can go now , Helmuth . Get out . Rode stands and bows .
FURTWÄNGLER: Furtwängler .
EMMI: Major , Major he 's here
STEVE: Shut the door , Emmi . Sit down , Emmi . We 're going to keep him waiting , too .
FURTWÄNGLER: Fraulein ? Emmi stops .
STEVE: Okay , Emmi , go get him .
EMMI: Dr. Furtwängler .
STEVE: I did n't hear anyone invite you to sit down .
FURTWÄNGLER: I have already been cleared by a Denazification Tribunal in Austria .
STEVE: What they do in Austria does n't interest me one little bit . Okay ? I have your questionnaire here , Gustav Heinrich Ernst Martin Wilhelm Furtwängler , born Berlin , January 1886 . Orchestral conductor . And you say here you were never a membe of the Nazi Party .
FURTWÄNGLER: That is correct .
STEVE: Could you tell us about being made a Prussian Privy Councillor . How did that happen to a non-Party member ?
FURTWÄNGLER: I received a telegram from Hermann Goering informing me that he had made me a Privy Councillor . I was not given the opportunity eithe to accept or refuse . After the dreadful events of November 1938 , the violent attacks on the Jews , I stopped using the title .
STEVE: What about Vice-President of the Chamber of Music , you used that title did n't you ? But then I suppose you had no choice there either , ecause I suppose Dr. Goebbels just sent you a telegram saying , Dear Mr . Vice-President .
FURTWÄNGLER: I do n't think Dr. Goebbels sent me a telegram . I was simply told . In a letter , I believe . I do n't emember exactly .
STEVE: Goebbels and Goering were sure heaping honours on you . One makes you a Privy Councillor , the othe makes you Vice-President of the Chamber of Music , and you were n't even a member of the Party , how do you explain that ?
FURTWÄNGLER: Well , there was a constant battle etween Goering and Goebbels as to which of them would control German culture . I was simply a pawn . Anyway , I resigned from the Musikkammer at the same time I esigned as Musical Director of the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra . In 1934 . David puts up a hand . Steve nods .
DAVID: Why was that ? Why did you resign , Dr. Furtwängler ?
FURTWÄNGLER: I wrote an open letter to the newspapers condemning what they were doing to music , making these distinctions between Jews and non- Jews . For my part , the only divide in art is between good and bad . Eventually , Goebbels summoned me and told me I could leave the country if I wanted to but unde no condition would I ever be allowed to return . I always believe that you have to fight from the inside not from without . I asked myself , what 's the duty of an artist , to stay or to leave ? And then Goebbels demanded that I acknowledge Hitle as solely responsible for cultural policy . Well , that was a fact and it seemed pointless to deny it . I simply acknowledged that Hitle and the Minister of Culture appointed by him were solely esponsible for the cultural policy of the Reich . What I wanted to express was that I , personally , had no responsibility whatsoeve for their cultural policy . I have always had the view that art and politics should should have nothing to do with each other .
STEVE: Then why did you conduct at one of their Nuremberg rallies ?
FURTWÄNGLER: I did not conduct at at the rally , I conducted on the evening before the rally .
STEVE: That sounds like the small print in one of our insurance policies , Wilhelm . And what about April 19 , 1942 ? The eve of Hitler 's fifty- third birthday , the big celebration ; you conducted for Hitler , did n't you ? Was that in keeping with you view that art and politics have nothing to do with each other ?
FURTWÄNGLER: That that was a different matter , I I was tricked .
STEVE: How come ?
FURTWÄNGLER: Could I have a glass of water , please ? Please , Fraulein ?
EMMI: Straube .
FURTWÄANGLER: Thank you . I was in Vienna , ehearsing the Ninth Symphony of Beethoven , when Goebbels called and said I had to conduct at Hitler 's birthday . I 'd always managed to wriggle out of such invitations , pleading previous engagements , illness , having my doctors state I was not well and so on and so on . I was also fortunate that Baldur von Shirach , who controlled Vienna , hated Dr. Goebbels and would do anything to thwart his wishes . But this time Goebbels got to my doctors before me ; they were frightened off , and von Schirach was threatened , bullied and gave in . So , I had no alternative but to conduct fo Hitler . Believe me , I knew I had compromised , and I deeply regret it .
STEVE: Does n't sound much of a trick to me . Sounds like you made a deal .
FURTWÄNGLER: I made no deal !
STEVE: I do n't buy that .
FURTWÄNGLER: It 's the truth .
STEVE: I keep hearing you helped a lot of Jews to escape . How did you do that ?
FURTWÄNGLER: I do n't remember in detail , there were so many .
STEVE: Did you call someone you knew ?
FURTWÄNGLER: I may have , as as I said , I simply do n't remember .
STEVE: Let me me help you , then . You picked up the phone and made a call - 'Hello , Adolf ? Wilhelm speaking . Listen , old pal , there 's a Jew-boy musician I want you to help . He needs a permit to get to Paris . '
FURTWÄNGLER: May I ask a question ?
STEVE: Sure .
FURTWÄNGLER: When will my case be heard by the Tribunal ?
STEVE: Your guess is as good as mine .
FURTWÄNGLER: I need to work . I need to make my living . I live off the generosity of friends
STEVE: Tough , tough !
FURTWÄNGLER: Then why is it , please , that anothe conductor who was actually a membe of the Party , who used to play the Horst Wessel before his concerts , has already been cleared and is working again while I have to wait and wait and wait ?
STEVE: I do n't know , he was n't my case . Why did you escape to Switzerland just before the war ended ?
FURTWÄNGLER: It was because I learned that the Gestapo was about to arrest me .
STEVE: Why were they going to arrest you ?
FURTWÄNGLER: I believe it was because of anothe letter I 'd written to Goebbels lamenting the decline of musical standards due to racial policies .
STEVE: You did n't complain about the racial policies , just about the musical standards , is that right ? No response .
FURTWÄNGLER: During an enforced hour-long interval because of a power failure at a concert here in Berlin , Albert Speer , the Minister of Armaments , said to me , 'You look very tired Dr. Furtwängler , you should go abroad for a while . ' I knew exactly what he meant .
STEVE: You sure knew a lot of people in high places .
FURTWÄNGLER: It would be truer to say , I think , that a lot of people in high places knew me .
STEVE: You were real close to all of them , to Adolf , to Hermann , to Joseph , to Baldur , and now Albert , So , let 's hear the truth , let 's come clean . What was your Party number ?
FURTWÄNGLER: If you are going to bully me like this , Major , you had better do your homework . You obviously have no idea how impertinent and stupid your questions are . Steve is stung . His eyes narrow dangerously .
STEVE: David , you remember I said I had a question that he would n't be able to answer ? Well , I 'm gon na ask it now . You ready for this , Wilhelm ? It 's a tough one . Why did n't you get out right at the start when Hitler came to power in 1933 ? Why did n't you leave Germany ? No response .
FURTWÄNGLER: They were Jews , they had to leave . They were right to leave . I could not leave my country in her deepest misery . After all , I am a German . I I stayed in my homeland . Is that my sin in you eyes ?
STEVE: See , David ? He ca n't answer the question . I 'll ask it again , Wilhelm , and do n't give me any more airy-fairy , intellectual ullshit !
EMMI: Major Arnold 's office . Yes , he is . Offers the phone to David .
DAVID: David Wills . Yes , sir . Well , you want me to tell him ? Okay , Major Richards wants a word with you , sir .
STEVE: Why ca n't he just ask for me ? Why does he have to ask for you first ? Goddamn British , so correct !
FURTWÄNGLER: I 've had enough of this , I 'm leaving . He goes quickly . David dashes after him .
DAVID: Dr. Furtwängler ! Dr. Furtwängler ! Please , please Do n't . It 's not advisable .
STEVE: How many ? Jesus , that 's dynamite ! Okay .
EMMI: Dr. Furtwängler .
STEVE: Well now . Are n't we all sociable ? The others are made awkward .
FURTWÄNGLER: Yes , a despicable human being . He was in the Ministry of Culture . His job was to get rid of Jews in the arts .
STEVE: Yup , that 's him , that 's the guy . You know what else the little creep did ? He kept files , close on 250,000 files . And you know what 's in those files ?
FURTWÄNGLER: Certainly not , but I knew he had informers everywhere . Even in my orchestra there was someone
STEVE: Who ?
FURTWÄNGLER: I was n't told . I just knew it .
STEVE: How ?
FURTWÄNGLER: I was warned .
STEVE: Who warned you ?
FURTWÄNGLER: Goering . Because Hinkel was working for Goebbels .
STEVE: What did Goering say ?
FURTWÄNGLER: He told me to be careful as one of Goebbels ' men was watching me . He ead a report on me - everything I said was quoted word by word .
STEVE: Oh boy , you 're gon na love this . Take your time with this now . Those files contain the details of every working artist in this country . Those files are gon na tell us who joined the Party , who informed and who was helpful .
SECURITY: Your name , please .
DAVID: David Wills .
SECURITY: Over there .
STEVE: Fantastic ! The only condition is we have to do the work here . I want you to collect all the files on the boys in the band .
EMMI: Maybe you can have a look at this .
DAVID: Schubert .
DYMSHITZ: Dr. Furtwängler - Furtwängler stops .
FURTWÄNGLER: The tempi were a little too correct for my taste . But I expect that is ecause of the rain . He nods politely , is about to go -
DYMSHITZ: Wait , Doctor , I understand you have difficulties with the Americans . I want you to know , I am your champion . We can help .
EMMI: What does he mean , too correct ?
DAVID: I do n't know . Huddled under their umbrella , they dash off .
STEVE: Well , what is this , the office party ? David and Emmi are frozen with embarrassment .
DAVID: I 'm very sorry , Major , but I promised her mother , we have to go . They leave quickly .
EMMI: Do n't see me to my door , there 's no need .
DAVID: But I promised your mother . She stops , turns .
EMMI: Well , sleep well . She continues on her way .
AN OFFICER: Sssh !
SERGEANT: Lieutenant Wills , telephone - David rises and as he goes
THE OFFICER: What is this , a railway station ?
DAVID: David . Wills . Hello ? Who ? Who in Wiesbaden ?
RODE: Major .
STEVE: Helmuth .
RODE: Guess what I am holding in my hand . You like guessing games ?
STEVE: Love 'em , Helmuth . I give up . What are you holding in your hand ?
RODE: It 's Dr. Furtwängler 's baton , which I stole .
STEVE: The one he kept in his right hand . Yes , you remember .
RODE: Yes , you remember .
STEVE: How could I forget ?
RODE: Show you ?
STEVE: Yeah , show me , I want to see you do it . Pretend I 'm Adolf . You 're the maestro , and you have the baton in your right hand , but you give me the salute just the same .
RODE: Not here , Major , there are people , if anybody should see please , please , Major
STEVE: Do it , Helmuth .
STEVE'S VOICE: You look great doing that . Rode and Steve Rode looks around nervously , lowers his arm .
STEVE: And I see what you mean . You nearly poked my eyes out .
RODE: Exactly . Replaces the baton , gives Steve the case .
STEVE: Do n't worry , Helmuth , it 'll be ou secret .
BOY: Mister , mister , here , here , mister ! ! ! Steve tosses the ball back to him .
STEVE: Great catch , kid . The boy runs off .
RODE: So . You wanted to see me .
STEVE: All in the cause of humanity , Helmuth . Or should I call you one- zero-four-nine-three-three-one ?
RODE: What ?
STEVE: One-zero-four-nine-three-three- one . Or d'you mind if I just call you 'one ' ?
RODE: That bastard ! People by the lakeside
STEVE: Who 's the bastard , Helmuth ? Hinkel ? Rode nods .
RODE: I was a member of the Communist Party . I was a communist . That 's what Hinkel had over me . He knew everything . He held that over me . That 's how he made me co-operate .
STEVE: Oh , I see , he made you co-operate . And now are you a communist again ?
RODE: You do n't know what it 's like to wake up every single morning of your life terrified , you do n't know that - Brief silence . Steve stands . Further along the lakeside
STEVE: Helmuth , you ever heard of plea- argaining ?
RODE: Major , we 're discussing a man of genius , I do n't want
STEVE: Fuck that , Helmuth . You want to discuss symbols here ? This guy was a front man . He was the piper , ut he played their tune , you get my philosophical meaning ? I 'm not interested in small fish , I 'm afte Moby Dick . Come on , Helmuth . Hard facts . Silence . Then Rode slowly raises his head .
RODE: The only thing I know is he 's an anti-Semite .
STEVE: Of course . You , too . Like everyone else in this goddamn country .
RODE: I 've remembered something else
STEVE: Yeah ?
RODE: Furtwängler sent Hitler a telegram for his birthday .
STEVE: He did ?
RODE: One of your people told me .
STEVE: One of my people ? They start to walk away from the water .
RODE: Yes . A corporal . US Army . A Jew . He said he 'd seen the telegram in the Chancellery .
STEVE: Son-of-a-gun . We 'll find the corporal and we 'll find the telegram .
RODE: No . But that 's why we hated him . We admired him as a conductor but we all hated him too because he did n't have to join the Party and yet he had a better life than any of us . He did n't have to go and deliver a report after every trip abroad . He got everything from them , everything . He was filthie than any of us Party members . The sun is setting . Rode stops suddenly .
STEVE: Never heard of him , who is he ?
RODE: Edwin von der Null . Music critic . He gave Furtwängler terrible reviews while he raved about Herbert von Karajan .
STEVE: Who 's he ?
RODE: Also a conductor . Very brilliant . Young . Von der Null called him 'The Miracle von Karajan ' . Furtwängler was outraged and they say he had von der Null conscripted into the army . The same thing happened to another critic . True or not , it 's not such a bad idea . Critics give you bad reviews , you have them sent to the Russian front . But if you really want to get Furtwängler , ask him about Herbert von Karajan .
STEVE: The Miracle Kid .
RODE: Yes , yes you may notice that he can not even bring himself to utte his name , he he refers to him as K .
STEVE: His private life ?
RODE: Yes , it 's all in here . His women .
MARTIN: Where do you stand on all this ?
DAVID: On all what ?
MARTIN: On Furtwängler .
DAVID: I do n't know . He breaks off .
MARTIN: You represent the United States now . We have a moral duty to be just and we have to be seen to be just .
DAVID: Major Arnold believes he has a moral duty , too .
MARTIN: Our duty is to help Furtwängle with his defence , That 's why I want you to look at this These are part of the transcripts of the trial at Nuremberg . We ca n't get them translated fast enough . But I guess you understand German , ight ? Passes papers across to David .
WERNER: Lieutenant Wills . David nods
DAVID: Yeah , of course .
WERNER: The whole orchestra will vouch fo him . He was always there to support us .
DAVID: We need names , if possible with addresses , because it 's urgent . Names of musicians saved by Dr. Furtwängler , people he helped to escape abroad . Let 's go somewhere public .
DYMSHITZ: To co-operation . They drink . Dymshitz pours more vodka .
STEVE: I was in Vienna . I had with me an Austrian chauffeur , Max his name was , he spent time in the camps . We were looking at these Viennese cleaning up the bomb damage , scavenging for rotting food , butt ends , anything . I said , 'To think a million of these people came out to welcome Adolf on the day he entered the city , a million of 'em , and now look at 'em . ' And Max said , 'Oh , not these people , Major . These people were all at home hiding Jews in their attics . ' You get the point , Colonel ? The point is they 're all full of shit .
DYMSHITZ: Furtwängler 's in a different category .
STEVE: We 're dealing with degenerates here .
DYMSHITZ: Degenerates ?
STEVE: That 's why he did n't get the hell out of here when he had the chance ! I put that to him , he could n't answer . Why did n't he go and direct in America , like that Italian , Toscanini .
DYMSHITZ: Perhaps perhaps he believed he could at least try to preserve something important , things like an orchestra , a school . That 's his country . Maybe he has an old mothe who ca n't be left alone . Maybe he has brothers , sisters you ca n't
STEVE: Colonel . He had no sisters , no others , only a lot of love affairs .
DYMSHITZ: Anyway , Major , why should he leave his country , his mother tongue , his family , his history , his past , his future , just because now , suddenly , there is a dictatorship ? Why ?
STEVE: But what before that turns otten What if they surround the space with barbed wire , Colonel ?
DYMSHITZ: Do n't talk about things you know nothing about . He was in a dictatorship !
STEVE: Yeah , yeah , art and politics , yeah , yeah , I heard all about that .
DYMSHITZ: In a dictatorship , art belongs to the Party . If you want to be a conductor , you have to have an orchestra . And you can only get an orchestra if you have contact with the power . All over the world you need the right contacts and you have to make the right compromises .
STEVE: This is what I 'm saying . He must have had Party contacts .
DYMSHITZ: There are good Party members who help , and there are dirty non-Party members who inform on you . Of course , they gave him privileges . Pause .
STEVE: What museum ?
DYMSHITZ: I 'm sorry . Museum ? Not I said orchestra . Sorry . Believe me . Help me , Steve . You say you answe for someone from high up . I , too , have orders from high up . Very high up . We want Furtwängler . I 'll give you in return the whole orchestra , four , five conductors . I need him , Steve .
STEVE: No can do .
DYMSHITZ: Let Furtwängler go . Please .
STEVE: I have a duty .
DYMSHITZ: Duty ? I am sorry , duty ? Duty fucking duty . Trouble is , you Americans want everybody to live like you . We liberated Berlin , Major Steve , not you . Our duty also is to bring ack the best of German culture . Dymshitz bursts out laughing .
STEVE: I 'm gon na get that fucking andleader , Colonel . No deal . No fucking deal .
DYMSHITZ: Then you 're going to kill me .
ARCHIVES: You 'll see ruins , you 'll see flowers , you 'll see some mighty pretty scenery , do n't let it fool you . You are in enemy country . The Nazi party may be gone , but Nazi thinking , Nazi training and Nazi trickery remain . Somewhere in this Germany are two million ex-Nazi officials . Out of power but still in there and thinking , thinking about next time . Remember that only yesterday every business , every profession was part of Hitler 's system . Practically every German was part of the Nazi network . They believed they were born to be masters . Do n't argue with them . You are not being sent Germany as educators . You 're a soldier on guard . You will observe their local laws , respect their costumes and eligion and you will respect thei property rights . You will not be friendly . You will be aloof , watchful and suspicious .
DAVID: Yesterday I read that Furtwängle was asked to lead the New York Philharmonic back in '36 , Toscanini suggested it . Had he accepted , he would have become the most celebrated conductor in America .
EMMI: When he made his decision , he could n't have known everything . Especially not the way people like you do , who 've returned from exile and feel that you have a right to pass judgement . Because you are lameless , you think you know best who is a sinner and who deserves forgiveness . But you have no idea how people lived here .
DAVID: When he met Hitler at his birthday and shook hands with him , was he pleased ?
EMMI: I do n't know . But you and I already know that he has saved lives .
STEVE: Do you know where the Adagio begins ?
EMMI: Of course .
STEVE: Put it on ready to play , and I 'll tell you when to play it .
FURTWÄNGLER: It is now nine o'clock precisely . I do not intend to be kept waiting again .
STEVE: Do n't talk to me like I was a second violinist . Go back into the waiting oom . Miss Straube will come and get you when I am ready to see you . Furtwängler goes out .
RODE: Would you perhaps like to have a glass of water , Herr Professor ?
FURTWÄNGLER: What is this man doing here ?
STEVE: Dr. Furtwängler ! Come in , come in , sit down .
FURTWÄNGLER: I wish to say something .
STEVE: Go ahead , be my guest .
FURTWÄNGLER: When I last saw you , I was unprepared . I did not know what to expect . In these past weeks , I have been thinking more carefully and making some notes . You have to understand who I am and what I am . I am a musician and I believe in music . I am an artist and I believe in art . Art in general , and music , in particular , has for me mystical powers which nurture man 's spiritual needs . I must confess , however , to being extremely naive . I insisted fo many years on the absolute separation of art and politics . My entire life was devoted to music ecause , and this is very important , ecause I thought that I could , through music , do something practical .
STEVE: And what was that ?
FURTWÄNGLER: Maintain liberty , humanity and justice .
STEVE: Gee , that 's a thing of beauty , honest to God , a real thing of eauty . I 'm going to try to remembe that . Liberty , humanity and justice . Beautiful . But you used the word 'naive ' . Are you now saying you think you were wrong ? That art and politics ca n't be separated ?
FURTWÄNGLER: I believe art and politics should e separate , but that they were n't kept separate I learned to my cost .
STEVE: And when did you first learn that - when you sent the telegram ? Was that the surrender signal , the waving of the white flag ?
FURTWÄNGLER: What telegram ?
STEVE: 'Happy birthday , dear Adolf , love Wilhelm . ' Or words to that effect . That sounds to me like you were dropping on your knees and saying , 'Okay , Adolf , you win . You 're the number one man . Have a swell party . '
FURTWÄNGLER: I have no idea what you 're talking about .
STEVE: The birthday greetings you sent to your old pal , Adolf Hider .
FURTWÄNGLER: I never sent him any birthday greetings or any other kind of greetings .
STEVE: Think carefully , Wilhelm maybe not in your own name , but as Privy Councillor or Vice-President .
FURTWÄNGLER: I do n't have to think carefully . This is utterly ridiculous .
STEVE: Yes , David ?
DAVID: Why not show Dr. Furtwängler the evidence . It may refresh his memory ?
FURTWÄNGLER: You wo n't find it because no such telegram exists .
STEVE: Well , I tried , you got to admit I tried . I thought I might just trap you there , Wilhelm , but David here was too quick for me . Smart move , David , smart move . No , I do n't have the telegram , but I know it exists . And I want you to know , Wilhelm , we 're going to keep looking for it because I believe you sent it .
FURTWÄNGLER: Then you are wrong .
STEVE: Art and politics , yeah , art and politics . Let 's look at that . You and the Berlin Philharmonic toured the Third Reich , played in countries the Nazis had conquered . Are you saying that conducting in occupied territories from 1939 on was n't a commercial for Adolf and all he stood for ?
FURTWÄNGLER: We never , never officially epresented the regime when we played abroad . We always performed as a private ensemble . As I think I already told you , I was a freelance conductor .
STEVE: You know something ? You should 've written our insurance policies fo us because you got more exclusion clauses than Double Indemnity . What do you imagine people thought ? The Berlin Philharmonic 's taken over by Doctor Goebbels and his Propaganda Ministry but Wilhelm is a freelance , so art and politics are now entirely separate ? Is that what you believed ordinary people thought ?
FURTWÄNGLER: have no idea what ordinary people thought .
STEVE: No !
FURTWÄNGLER: No , because I had only one intention . My only intention whatever I did was to show that music means more than politics .
STEVE: Tell me about von der Null .
FURTWÄNGLER: Von der Null ?
STEVE: Yes , von der Null .
FURTWÄNGLER: Von der Null ?
STEVE: How long 's this going to go on , Wilhelm ? I say von der Null , you say von der Null , I say von de Null , you say von der Null , we could go on all day . You know who von der Null is , do n't you ? Edwin von der Nuell , music critic .
FURTWÄNGLER: Yes , I know who he is .
STEVE: Is n't it true that because he gave you bad reviews and praised this young guy , Von Karajan , called him a goddamn miracle , said he was a etter conductor than you , then you had von der Null conscripted into the army and no one 's heard from him since ?
FURTWÄNGLER: That 's an outrageous lie !
STEVE: You sure you did n't call one of your close buddies and say , God in heaven , did you see what that guy von der Null wrote about me ? The greatest conductor on earth . I want him out the way . He had the nerve to accuse me I am not playing enough modern music . Send him to Stalingrad . Is n't that what you did ? You do n't like criticism , do you , Wilhelm ? You surely did n't like them saying there was anothe conductor who was better than you Are you saying the name von de Null was never mentioned in you talks with Goebbels ?
FURTWÄNGLER: Well . Once he said he 'd read what this man wrote about me .
STEVE: And what did he say ?
FURTWÄNGLER: He said , 'Do n't mind him . His jo is to criticise , your job is to conduct . '
STEVE: And what happened to Von der Nul ?
FURTWÄNGLER: I have no idea .
STEVE: You 've really no idea ? I 'll tell you what happened . He died in Stalingrad .
FURTWÄNGLER: I 'm sorry .
STEVE: Now , that young conductor what 's his name ? That miracle kid , you know who I mean . Von Karajan ! But you called him something else . C'mon . What did you call von Karajan ? Silence .
FURTWÄNGLER: Please stop playing these games with me . Why you should bring up the name of another conductor is eyond my understanding .
STEVE: I 'll tell you why . You remember we talked about you playing fo Hitler 's birthday ? And you told me that Goebbels got to your doctors first , that you were tricked ?
FURTWÄNGLER: Yes , that 's what happened .
STEVE: I have a different story to tell . I do n't think you were tricked . Not in the way you describe . I elieve something else happened . I 've seen the Hinkel Archive , I 've seen records of phone calls , and putting it all together , this is what I think happened . I think Goebbels said , 'Wilhelm , if you wo n't conduct for Adolf 's birthday , we 'll get the Miracle Kid , the guy that critic , von der Null , thinks is the greatest conductor in the world . He 's not just willing to conduct for Adolf , he 's offered to sing `` Happy Birthday '' as a solo . ' Silence .
FURTWÄNGLER: This is absolute nonsense !
STEVE: Well , I 'm just beginning to develop my theme . Is n't that what you call it in classical music , developing your theme ? Okay , so they played on your insecurity . That 's human , understandable . But , there is one guy who does n't like little K as much as he likes you - yeah , the number one man your old pal , Adolf . He thinks you 're the greatest , and when he says , I want Wilhelm fo my birthday , boy , they better go out get Wilhelm . So , Josef calls and threatens you with little K. And you said to hell with the Ninth in Vienna , I 'll give it to Adolf as a birthday present in Berlin . That 's the trick they played , they got you by the balls and they squeezed . Hard . Why did you stay ? Why did you play for them ? Why were you the flag-carrier for thei egime ? Jealousy ?
FURTWÄNGLER: Of course there was a conspiracy against me , a campaign - even abroad . Brief silence ; all eyes on him .
STEVE: You see , Wilhelm , I 'm talking about ordinary , everyday reasons . Which is why I want to discuss you private life . How many illegitimate children do you have ?
DAVID: Major , I do n't see how this line of questioning could
STEVE: David , what are you Counsel fo the Defence now ? Did you hear the question ?
FURTWÄNGLER: I have illegitimate children .
STEVE: What ?
FURTWÄNGLER: I said I have illegitimate children . I do n't know how many .
STEVE: You like the women , do n't you , Wilhelm ? No response .
DAVID: Major , this is deeply offensive and repugnant !
STEVE: You bet .
DAVID: and totally irrelevant .
STEVE: Not so , Counsellor . That secretary of yours , she was n't just you secretary , she procured women fo you , did n't she ? As many and as often as you wanted .
FURTWÄNGLER: Stop this , please , stop this now !
STEVE: No , I 'm not going to stop it . Hitle himself offered you a beautiful house and a personal bomb shelter .
FURTWÄNGLER: I absolutely refused the house and the bomb shelter .
STEVE: But you see what I 'm getting at ? You get a gorgeous house , you 're highly paid . What are you gon na do , stay or leave ? One voice comes ack at me stay !
DAVID: Major , that 's not a good argument . If Dr. Furtwängler did indeed enjoy all these these privileges , he enjoyed them because of who he is and what he is . That 's true of any leading artist in any country in the world .
STEVE: But it still does n't make them saints . They still have to get up and piss in the middle of the night , do n't they ? They can still be vindictive and envious and mean just like you and me . Well , just like me . Ca n't they ? No response . To Furtwängler
FURTWÄNGLER: I do n't understand what you mean .
STEVE: No , that 's your problem , Wilhelm . You understand nothing . We 'll call you . Go ! Furtwängler leaves .
DAVID: Major .
STEVE: What ?
DAVID: Your manner .
STEVE: My manner ? Why do n't you go downstairs , get a cup of coffee and calm down ? What 's the matter , Emmi ? What 's going on with you ? What 's wrong ?
EMMI: I 'm sorry but I have to leave . I 'll find other work . You 'll have to get someone else , that 's all .
STEVE: What is this , Emmi ?
EMMI: I ca n't do this . It 's not right .
STEVE: What 's not right ?
EMMI: I have been questioned by the Gestapo just like that . Just like you questioned him .
STEVE: Emmi , stop ! I want to show you something . Let me show you something and then if you want to leave , you can leave , please please . His friends , they did this . And he gave them birthday concerts .
EMMI: But he had no idea , a lot of people had no idea . I only realised what was really going on when I got arrested .
STEVE: If he had no idea , why did the Jews need saving ? This is the question , Emmi , to all Germans Why did the Jews need saving in this country ? Why , if people had no idea ?
EMMI: I would like to go now , please .
DAVID: Can I ask you a favour , Major ?
STEVE: Yeah .
DAVID: When you question him again , could you treat him with more respect ?
STEVE: With more what ? More what ?
DAVID: Major , he may just be the greatest conductor of this century and that merits respect .
STEVE: David , I do n't understand a thing about you . You 're a Jew . Are you a Jew ?
DAVID: Yes , I 'm a Jew . But I like to think first I 'm a human being .
STEVE: A human being , oh , good , I 'm elieved , I thought you were going to say you were a music lover . This man , this great artist has made anti-Semitic remarks like you would n't believe . I got letters .
DAVID: Major , show me someone who has n't made an anti-Semitic remark and I 'll show you the gates of paradise .
STEVE: What is it with you , David ? Where are your feelings ? Where 's you hatred , your disgust ? Where 's you fucking outrage , David ? He starts to go , then comes back to them .
DAVID: I want you to come back to the office . May I come in ? If you are there you can influence what happens . What good can you do by leaving . If you go , you are giving up and how can you help Furtwängle or me ? Do n't think about leaving . Stay .
STEVE: Everybody says what a great enefactor you were to the Jews . But I have things here you said and wrote . Listen to this 'The Jew composer Schonberg is admired by the Jewish International . ' And what about this 'Jewish musicians lack a genuine affinity with ou music . ' 'Jewish musicians are good usinessmen with few scruples , lacking roots . ' You deny you said these things ?
FURTWÄNGLER: Those attitudes do not exist in me .
STEVE: I believe that . But just answe the question , do n't give me explanations .
FURTWÄNGLER: Speaking to Party members I used their language , of course I did , everyone did .
DAVID: Major , sorry to interrupt , but maybe we have to maybe we have to balance those things against his assistance to his Jewish colleagues . Steve tenses .
EMMI: 'Please remember that Dr. Furtwängler risked his life to help anyone who asked him . I personally testify to having seen literally hundreds of people lined up outside his dressing room afte concerts to ask for his help . He never turned anyone away . After he heard me play I am a violinist he gave me money because I was unable to feed myself or my family and then he helped me to escape to Sweden . He helped countless people in similar ways . '
DAVID: And this , only one of these letters , Major . I have lots of them .
STEVE: How many times have I got to tell you I was in insurance ? You think I ca n't smell a phoney policy when it 's shoved under my nose ? Sure , he helped Jews , but that was just insurance , his cover , because all the while he was maestro of all he surveyed , See , Wilhelm , I think you 're thei oy , their creature . You were like an advertising slogan for them this is what we produce , the greatest conductor in the world . And you went along with it . The truth of the matter is , Wilhelm , you did n't need to be a member of the Party . I made a mistake when I asked you for your Party number . I should 've asked you for your non- Party number . Just like some othe well-known artists . Emmi , put that record on .
FURTWÄNGLER: Of course I know what that is .
STEVE: Okay , so what is it ?
FURTWÄNGLER: Bruckner 's Seventh . The Adagio .
STEVE: Who 's conducting ?
FURTWANGLBR: I am .
STEVE: You know the last time it was played on these air waves ?
FURTWÄNGLER: How can I know such a thing ?
STEVE: I 'll tell you , then . The last time this music was played on these ai waves was after they announced that your pal Hitler had shot himself . Listen to it . They listen . Did they pick little K 's recording ? Did they pick some other conductor ? No , they picked you , and why ? Because you represented them so eautifully . When the Devil died , they wanted his bandleader to conduct the funeral march . You were everything to them . The music plays .
FURTWÄNGLER: I have always tried to analyse myself carefully and closely . In staying here , I believed I walked a tightrope between exile and the gallows . You seem to be blaming me for not having allowed myself to e hanged . David takes the record off .
STEVE: Have you ever smelled burning flesh ? I smelt it four miles away . Fou miles away , I smelt it . Have you ever seen the gas chambers , the crematoria ? Have you seen the mounds of rotting corpses ? You talk to me about culture , art and music ? You putting that in the scales , Wilhelm ? You setting culture , art and music against the millions put to death y your pals ? They had orchestras in the camps . They played Beethoven , Wagner . The hangmen were playing chamber music at home with thei families . I do n't understand the Germans ' relationship with music . What do you need music for ? You pals you could call to save a few Jews when millions of them were eing annihilated ? Yes , I blame you for not getting hanged , I blame you for your cowardice . You strutted and swaggered , you fucking piece of shit , king-pin in a shithouse . You talk to me about walking a tightrope between exile and the gallows , and I say to you , lies !
FURTWÄNGLER: I love my country , I believe in music , what was I to do ?
STEVE: Look around you . See the country you served . Look at people who had eal courage , who took risks , who isked their lives . Like Emmi 's father .
EMMI: My father only joined the plot when he realised that we could not win the war . She cries quietly .
FURTWÄNGLER: What kind of a world do you want , Major ? What kind of world are you going to make ? Do you honestly elieve that the only reality is the material world , so you will be left nothing , nothing but feculence more foul-smelling than that which pervades you nights How was I to understand , how was I to know what they were capable of ? No one knew . No one knew .
STEVE: Get him out of here .
FURTWÄNGLER: Thank you , Fraulein . You have been most kind . He smiles at her . She is embarrassed .
STEVE: Major Arnold . Get me General Wallace . General ? Major Arnold , about Furtwängler . I do n't know if we 've got a case that 'll stand up , ut sure as hell we can give him a hard time .
STEVE'S VOICE: We handed Wilhelm Furtwängler ove to the civil authorities and he was charged with serving the Nazi egime , with uttering anti-Semitic slurs , performing at an official Nazi Party function and with being a Prussian Privy Councillor . Dr. Furtwängler was acquitted . I did n't nail him . But I sure winged him . And I know I did the right thing . Furtwängler resumed his career but he was never allowed to conduct in the United States . He died in 1954 . Little K succeeded him as head of the Berlin Philharmonic .
HERBERT GREENLEAF: Most enjoyable . Herbert Greenleaf .
RIPLEY: Tom Ripley . Thank you , sir .

EMILY GREENLEAF: Darling couple , are n't they ?
HERBERT GREENLEAF: Yes . An exceptional young man .

RIPLEY: I 've always wanted to go to Europe , sir , ut

MEREDITH: No , it 's just - you are American , are n't you ? - no , I just , I have so much luggage , and you 're so , uh , streamlined . It 's humiliating .
RIPLEY: Dickie , Dickie Greenleaf . Hello .
MEREDITH: Hello .
RIPLEY: Trying not to be . Trying to jump ship .
MEREDITH: So now , did they put your suitcase in the wrong pile ? It 's just - upstairs -

RIPLEY: Well , I knew you , so I suppose you must have known me .
DICKIE: Princeton is like a fog , America 's like a fog . This is Marge Sherwood . Tom - sorry , what was it ?
RIPLEY: Ripley . Hullo . How do you do .
MARGE: How do you do .
DICKIE: What are you doing in Mongi ?
RIPLEY: Nothing . Nothing much . Passing through .
DICKIE: Passing through ! You 're so white . Did you ever see a guy so white , Marge ? Gray , actually .
RIPLEY: It 's just an undercoat .
DICKIE: Say again ?
RIPLEY: You know , a primer .
DICKIE: That 's funny .
MARGE: You should come and have lunch with us , efore you go - Dickie ?
DICKIE: Sure . Any time .
MARGE: And be careful in the sun . Your gray 's in danger of turning a little pink .
RIPLEY: Thanks . Well , a coincidence .
DICKIE: I 've been looking for you everywhere .
SILVANA: Ah , today you 're looking for me . And where have you been the rest of the week ? Pig . With your American girl ? I hate you , you know ?
DICKIE: What ?
SILVANA: I hate you .
DICKIE: Sorry , sorry , sorry . I know , I 'm late , I 'm a swine .
MARGE: Did you forget where I live ? It 's fou o'clock .
DICKIE: I just woke up . I 'm sorry .
MARGE: You just woke up !
DICKIE: Fausto and I - we took the boat out , we were fishing , and then it was dawn and we 'd caught absolutely nothing .
MARGE: Well , we ate everything without you .
DICKIE: We ?
MARGE: Yes , Tom Ripley 's here .
DICKIE: Who ? Oh , Tom , hello , how are you ? We thought you 'd disappeared . We were going to send out a search party .
RIPLEY: No , still here .
MARGE: Tom was telling me about his trip over . Made me laugh so much I got a nosebleed .
DICKIE: Is that good ?
MARGE: Shut up !
RIPLEY: I 'm intruding .
DICKIE: Can you mix a martini ?
RIPLEY: Sure .
MARGE: I 'll do it . I make a fabulous martini .
DICKIE: Everybody should have one talent . What 's yours ?
RIPLEY: Forging signatures . Telling lies . Impersonating practically anybody .
DICKIE: That 's three . Nobody should have more than one talent . Okay , do an impression .
RIPLEY: Now ? Okay . Wait a minute . Talent - i > The only talent my son has is for cashing his allowance. < /i
DICKIE: What ? What 's this ?
RIPLEY: I like to sail , believe me , I love to sail ! Instead I make boats and othe people sail them. < /i
DICKIE: Stop ! It 's too much ! You 're making all the hairs on my neck stand up !
RIPLEY: i > Jazz , let 's face it , it 's just an insolent noise. < /i
DICKIE: I feel like he 's here . Horrible . Like the old bastard is here right now ! That 's illiant ! How do you know him ?
RIPLEY: I met him in New York .
DICKIE: Marge ! You 've got to hear this !
MARGE: What ? What ?
DICKIE: Meet my father , Herbert Richard Greenleaf 1st .
RIPLEY: Pleasure to meet you , Dickie 's made a fine catch . I know Emily thinks so. < /i
MARGE: What 's going on ?
DICKIE: Uncanny !
MARGE: I do n't get it .
RIPLEY: Could you ever conceive of going there , Tom , and bringing him back ? < /i
DICKIE: What ?
RIPLEY: I 'd pay you . If you would go to Italy and persuade my son to come home . I 'd pay you $ 1000. < /i
DICKIE: I 'm never going back . To actually hire somebody to come all the way here to drag me back home - got to be insane , has n't he ?
RIPLEY: No , I think your mother , her illness -
DICKIE: It 's got nothing to do with my mother ! She 's had leukemia for - ! This is what makes me boil about him ! HE wants me ack ! - it 's got nothing to do with my mother .
RIPLEY: I do n't know , Dickie , I 'm just telling you what I -
DICKIE: Go back ! Go back to New York or call him if you can find a telephone that works , and tell him wild horses would n't drag me ack to him or his shipyard .
MARGE: Hi Tom .
DICKIE: Marge , Ripley 's saying goodbye .
MARGE: I 'll come down .
DICKIE: Did you speak to my father ?
RIPLEY: You were right about the telephones . There are no lines , there 's some problem .
MARGE: Hello Tom . You 're off ? What are you plans ?
RIPLEY: Back , I suppose , slowly as I can .
DICKIE: You like jazz !
RIPLEY: I love jazz .
DICKIE: This is the best . Marge says she likes jazz , but she things Glenn Miller is jazz .
MARGE: I never said that !
RIPLEY: Bird . That 's jazz .
DICKIE: Bird ! Ask me the name of my sailboat -
RIPLEY: I do n't know . What 's the name of you sailboat ?
DICKIE: Bird ! < /i
MARGE: Which is ridiculous . Boats are female , everyone knows you ca n't call a boat after a man .
RIPLEY: He 's not a man , he 's a god .
DICKIE: Okay , we 're going to Naples . There 's a club , it 's not a club , it 's a cellar .
MARGE: It 's vile .
DICKIE: Yes , it 's vile . Do n't worry , you do n't have to come . It 's great . You 're going to love it .
FAUSTO: i > Ladies and Gentlemen . Dickie Greenleaf , all the way from America etc. < /i
DICKIE: Good afternoon !
RIPLEY: What time is it ? Oh God ! Do you always type your letters ? That should be two Ts .
DICKIE: I ca n't write and I ca n't spell . That 's the privilege of a first-class education . You 're upstairs at the back . I think Ermelinda made the bed up .
RIPLEY: This is so good of you .
DICKIE: Do n't say it again . Now you 're a Double Agent and we 're going to string my Dad alone , I was thinking we might buy a little car with the expense money he 's sending you . What do you think , Margea little Cinquecento with my Dad 's money ? Marge has appeared , carrying Camparis .
MARGE: Dickie , you ca n't even drive a car ! No , what we need urgently is an icebox . What do you think , Tom ? Agree with me and I 'll e your friend for life .
RIPLEY: I absolutely agree with Marge .
DICKIE: It 'll just be for a little while . He can e he makes me laugh .
MARGE: Okay , darling .
DICKIE: You 'd say if you mind ?
MARGE: No , I like him .
DICKIE: Marge , you like everybody .
MARGE: I do n't like you .
DICKIE: Then I 'll go to your place and you can move in with Tom .
MARGE: It 's the one task Dickie can do on his own - make coffee .
DICKIE: Shut up .
MARGE: Oh darling - is that for me ?
DICKIE: No it 's for Tom as he did n't complain .
RIPLEY: That ring 's so great . The green one .
MARGE: Tom , I love you ! See ! I bought it for him , for his birthday .
RIPLEY: It 's superb .
DICKIE: I had to promise , capital P , never to take it off - otherwise I 'd give it to you .
MARGE: Bastard ! Is n't it great , Tom ? I found it in Naples . I bargained for about two weeks .
DICKIE: I hope it was n't cheap .
MARGE: Oh , it was .
RIPLEY: I have to find a birthday present fo Frances . Perhaps you can help me ?
MARGE: Frances ?
RIPLEY: My fiancÈe .
DICKIE: You 're a dark horse , Ripley . Engaged ?
RIPLEY: Your parents met her .
DICKIE: Oh God - I can just imagine - if only Dickie would settle down does n't every parent deserve a grandchild ? Never ! I swear on your ring , Marge . I am neve going back .
RIPLEY: I 'm doing this wrong , are n't I ?
DICKIE: You 're doing great . We 'll make a sailo of you yet . You 're doing really well .
MARGE: Dubious but special honor , Tom - crewing Dickie 's boat . Alright , bar 's open .
DICKIE: Yes please !
RIPLEY: Could we sail to Venice ?
DICKIE: Sure . I love Venice .
RIPLEY: I have to go to Venice .
DICKIE: See Venice and die , is n't that right ? O is it Rome ? You do something and die , do n't you ? Okay , Venice is on the list .
RIPLEY: And Rome .
DICKIE: Do you ski ? Do n't tell me - you 're a lost cause ! That 's the next thing to deal with . We 're planning to go to Cortina at Christmas . Excellent skiing . Excellent . Marge - Ripley ca n't ski . We 'll have to teach him that , too . Have you ever known such low class ?
MARGE: Poor Tom . Good thing we 're not getting married . We might have to invite him on our honeymoon .
SILVANA: E fichi ? Come sempre ? < /i
MARGE: Si . Come sempre . Grazie. < /i
DICKIE: Okay .
SILVANA: Did you get my message ? I want to talk to you .
DICKIE: I want to talk to you tooSmile for me .
RIPLEY: What ?
DICKIE: You 're breaking my ribs !
RIPLEY: I played piano in a few places .
DICKIE: That 's one job , you told me a lot of jobs .
RIPLEY: A few places - that 's a few jobs . Anyway , I do n't want to think about New York .
DICKIE: The mysterious Mr Ripley . Marge and I spend hours speculating . Cold beer . Thank you Dad .
RIPLEY: Copy out from here
DICKIE: I love the fact you brought Shakespeare with you and no clothes . Ermelinda says you wash the same shirt out every night . Is that true ?
RIPLEY: No ! I 've got more than one shirt !
DICKIE: She can do that stuff for you . Anyway , just wear some of my things , wea anything you want , most of it 's ancient .
RIPLEY: Now your signature . Not `` Dickie '' . Your signature .
DICKIE: Without the glasses you 're not even ugly . I do n't need them because I never read . How do I look .
RIPLEY: Like Clark Kent . Now Superman .
DICKIE: I know . I write like a child .
DICKIE: It must be a deep secret , cause I do n't know about it .
RIPLEY: Your handwriting - nothing more naked . See - nothing 's quite touching the line - that 's vanity .
DICKIE: Well we certainly know that 's true .
RIPLEY: No , no brothers , no sisters .
DICKIE: me neither . Nor does Marge . All only children - what does that mean ?
RIPLEY: Means we never shared a bath . I 'm cold . Can I get in ?
DICKIE: No !
RIPLEY: I did n't mean with you in it .
DICKIE: Okay , you get in . I 'm like a prune anyway .
RIPLEY: Fran . i > I miss you , where are you coming home ? Stop telling me what a great time you 're having , how you love Dickie and Marge and < /i And this one , I think , is your dad
DICKIE: What does he say ?
RIPLEY: He 's getting impatient . He wants me to eassure him you 'll be home by Thanksgiving .
DICKIE: You 've got to get a new jacket . Really . You must be sick of the same clothes . I 'm sick of seeing you in them .
RIPLEY: I ca n't . I ca n't keep spending you father 's money .
DICKIE: I love how responsible you are . My Dad should make you Chief Accountant o something . Let me buy you a jacket . There 's a great place when we get to Rome , Batistoni .
RIPLEY: Where do we find a carozza for the Forum , or can we hire any of them - ?
DICKIE: Relax .
RIPLEY: It 's just there 's so much to do in a single day .
DICKIE: Relax . The most important question is where to eat . I hope Freddie made a eservation .
RIPLEY: Freddie ?
DICKIE: Freddie Miles . You know - he 's organizing the Cortina skiing trip .
FREDDIE: Ciao bello . Do n't you want to fuck every woman you see . Just once . They kiss cheeks , continental-style .
DICKIE: This is Tom Ripley . Freddie Miles .
FREDDIE: Hey , if I 'm late , think what he husband 's saying !
DICKIE: I 'll tell you - I am so cabin-crazy with Mongi .
FREDDIE: I know . I was there . Tommy ! It 's S.R.O . Two seater . Standing Room Only . Chop , chop , Tommy !
DICKIE: Look , Tom , we 've got to go to a club and meet some friends of Freddie 's . The best thing is - if you want to be a tourist - grab a cab and we can meet up at the ailway station .
RIPLEY: What club ?
DICKIE: Freddie 's arranged it with some of the skiing crowd . Come if you want but I thought you wanted to see the Forum ?
RIPLEY: I did . And then maybe get the jacket and what have you
FREDDIE: Dick - you 've got to hear this !
DICKIE: Listen , just take one of mine when we get ack . Do n't worry about it . I did the Forum with Marge and , frankly , once is enough in anyone 's life . Ripley hands him the coats , turns away .
RIPLEY: You said to make sure you did n't miss the train . It leaves at eight .
DICKIE: I wish you 'd get out of my clothes .
RIPLEY: You said I could pick out a jacket and I just Sorry .
DICKIE: Get undressed in your own room , would you ?
RIPLEY: I thought you 'd missed the train .
DICKIE: Freddie drove me back in his car .
RIPLEY: Is Freddie here ?
DICKIE: He 's downstairs .
RIPLEY: I was just fooling around . Do n't say anything . Sorry .
MARGE: Hi , Tom . Come join us .
FREDDIE: I want this job of yours , Tommy . I was just saying - You live in Italy , sleep in Dickie 's house , eat Dickie 's food , wea his clothes , and his father picks up the tab . If you get bored , let me know , I 'll do it !
MARGE: You really should go in , it 's marvellous .
RIPLEY: I 'm fine .
MARGE: Are you okay ?
RIPLEY: Sure .
MARGE: The thing with Dickie - it 's like the sun shines on you and it 's glorious , then he forgets you and it 's very very cold .
RIPLEY: So I 'm learning .
MARGE: He 's not even aware of it . When you 've got his attention you feel like you 're the only person in the world . That 's why everybody loves him . Other times
DICKIE: He 's drowning me !
MARGE: It 's always the same whenever someone new comes into his life - Freddie , Fausto , Peter Smith-Kingsley - he 's wonderful - did you meet him , he 's a musician ? - and especially you , of course and that 's only the boys .
RIPLEY: What about Cortina ?
MARGE: Did n't Dick say ? - he talked to Freddie apparently it 's not going to work out - Freddie says there are n't enough rooms .
DICKIE: Come on , Frederico , do you really have to go back ? At least stick around fo the Festival of the Madonna .
FREDDIE: I do n't think so . Come back with me to Rome . There 's this great new club . Have some drinks , lotta ladies
DICKIE: Do you think you can steer this thing ?
FREDDIE: Sure .
DICKIE: Just point her at Capri and avoid the ocks .
FREDDIE: What are you doing ?
DICKIE: Marge-maintenance .
FREDDIE: Aye , aye .
RIPLEY: What 's the fight about ? That 's he fiancÈ , is n't it ? Are they blaming him ?
DICKIE: I do n't know ! Why are you asking me ? How can it take an hour to find an ambulance ?
MARGE: Well , she was already dead , darling , was n't she , so I suppose -
DICKIE: I do n't know why people say this country 's civilised . It is n't . It 's fucking primitive .
MARGE: Dickie !
RIPLEY: I 'll go and see what 's the matter .
MARGE: I 'll go .
RIPLEY: I know why you 're upset . I know about Silvana , Dickie . About you and Silvana . Dickie stops playing .
DICKIE: What about us ?
RIPLEY: I 'm prepared to take the blame .
DICKIE: What are you talking about ?
RIPLEY: You 've been so good to me . You 're the other I never had . I 'm the brother you never had .
DICKIE: She came to me for help , she needed money , and I did n't help her . I did n't help her . Now she 's dead and it 's my fault .
RIPLEY: I 'm not going to say anything - to Marge , or anybody , the police - It 's a secret etween us and I 'll keep it .
DICKIE: You ca n't blame him . You could hardly expect this to go on forever .
RIPLEY: I thought you might write again . Now that we 're brothers
DICKIE: I ca n't , how can I , in all decency ? We 've had a good run , have n't we ?
RIPLEY: What about Venice ? Can we stick to that plan at least ?
DICKIE: I do n't think so , Tom . You ca n't stay on here without money . It 's time we all moved on . Besides I 'm sick of Mongi . Especially now with everything - I really want to move to the North . I need to check out San Remo next week , find somewhere new to keep the boat . But it would be great , though , if you came with me . Our last trip before you leave . There 's a jazz festival - we could say goodbye in style . What do you think ? A last trip ?
RIPLEY: To Mongibello and the happiest days of my life .
DICKIE: To Mongi . You 're cheerful tonight .
RIPLEY: I 'm suddenly quite happy to be going ack .
DICKIE: That 's good .
RIPLEY: I 've got plans !
DICKIE: Ripley 's plans .
RIPLEY: Esatto . I 'm always planning .
DICKIE: Did I know you at Princeton , Tom ? I did n't , did I ?
RIPLEY: Why are you asking all of a sudden ?
DICKIE: No reason . Because you 're leaving , I guess . I do n't think you were there , were you ?
RIPLEY: Why ?
DICKIE: I mean it as a compliment . You 've got such great taste , I do n't know . Most of the thugs at Princeton had tasted everything and had no taste . Used to say , the cream of America rich and thick . Freddie 's the perfect example .
RIPLEY: Then I 'll take it as a compliment .
DICKIE: I knew it ! I had a bet with Marge !
RIPLEY: Ha .
DICKIE: Do you even like jazz - or was that something for my benefit ?
RIPLEY: I 've gotten to like it . I 've gotten to like everything about the way you live . It 's one big love affair . If you knew my life back home in New York
DICKIE: I 'm thinking of giving up the sax , what do you think about drums ?
RIPLEY: What ?
DICKIE: So cool .
RIPLEY: Dickie , slow down , come on !
DICKIE: I love it here ! Gon na live here !
RIPLEY: I wanted to tell you my plan .
DICKIE: So tell me .
RIPLEY: I thought I might come back . In the New Year . Under my own steam .
DICKIE: Really ? To Italy ?
RIPLEY: Of course . Let 's say , for argument 's sake , you were here - perhaps we could split the rent on a house - I 'll get a job - or , better still , I could get a place in Rome and when we 're there we could be there and if we 're here we could e here -
DICKIE: Oh God , I do n't think so .
RIPLEY: - you see , particularly with the Marge problem , you can just blame me .
DICKIE: Marge and I are getting married .
RIPLEY: How ?
DICKIE: How ?
RIPLEY: Yesterday you 're ogling girls on the terrace , today you 're getting married . It 's absurd .
DICKIE: I love Marge .
RIPLEY: You love me and you 're not marrying me .
DICKIE: Tom , I do n't love you .
RIPLEY: No , no , it 's not a threat , I 've explained all of that .
DICKIE: I 'm actually a little relieved you 're going , to be honest . I think we 've seen enough of each other for a while .
RIPLEY: What ?
DICKIE: You can be a leech - you know this - and it 's boring . You can be quite boring .
DICKIE: What evening ?
RIPLEY: Sure - I know , that 's too dangerous fo you , fair enough , hey ! we 're brothers , fine , then you do this sordid thing with Marge , fucking her on the boat while we all have to listen , which was excruciating , frankly , plus you follow your cock around like a - and now you 're getting married ! I 'm bewildered , forgive meyou 're lying to Marge then getting married to her , you 're knocking up Silvana , you 've got to play sax , you 've got to play drums , which is it , Dickie , what do you really play ?
DICKIE: Who are you - some imposter , some third class mooch - who are you to tell me anything ? Actually , I really really eally do n't want to be on this boat with you , I ca n't move without you moving , which is exactly how it feels and it gives me the creeps . I ca n't move without - `` Dickie , Dickie , Dickie '' - like a little girl . You give me the -
RIPLEY: Shut up ! Just shut up ! Just shut up !
DICKIE: For God 's sake .
RIPLEY: Can I have my key , please ?
RECEPTIONIST: Of course - But you must be very cold ? Signor Greenleaf ? Yes ? -
RIPLEY: No , it 's - I 'm
MARGE: Tom , you startled me ! You 're back .
RIPLEY: How are you ? Sorry . Is your book going well ?
MARGE: Yes - I 'm on a good streak , thanks .
RIPLEY: I was just looking at you - - so quiet .
MARGE: Where 's Dickie ?
RIPLEY: I think he 's planning on staying in Rome for a few days .
MARGE: Ha . Did he say why ?
RIPLEY: I do n't know . I do n't understand Dickie , Marge , so your guess is as good as mine .
MARGE: What does that mean ?
RIPLEY: Well , one day I 'm invited skiing , the next day I 'm not , one day we 're all one family , the next day he wants to be alone . You tell me .
MARGE: Is that what he said - he wanted to be alone ?
RIPLEY: He was thinking of you , Marge - he asked me to deliver this .
MARGE: Thanks . he knows I love this , although why it could n't have waited
RIPLEY: Errand number one - deliver Marge 's perfume . Errand number two , pack some clothes and his precious saxophone .
MARGE: How long 's he staying for ?
RIPLEY: Search me . I guess we 're abandoned .
MARGE: There was a letter from Dickie in with my perfume . You realize it 's more than a few days ? He 's thinking of moving to Rome .
RIPLEY: I think you 're right .
ALDO: Welcome back , Signor Greenleaf .
RIPLEY: Thank you .
GUCCI ASSISTANT: Embossed , of course , Signor Greenleaf .
MEREDITH: Dickie ! Oh my God ! Ciao .
RIPLEY: What ?
MEREDITH: At Christmas . To Cortina with Freddie Miles and -
RIPLEY: How did you know that ?
MEREDITH: Everybody knows Freddie Miles .
RIPLEY: Is Freddie in Rome ?
MEREDITH: Now ? I do n't think so . But I 've met him , of course , and we 've chatted and I know about you and Marge and Mongi and what an unreliable rat you are . Freddie said you were a rat and I thought to myself now I know why he travels under R .
RIPLEY: I 've left Marge , Meredith . And Mongi . So the rat 's here now , in Rome .
MEREDITH: Sorry , I would n't have made a joke if -
RIPLEY: Do n't be sorry . I 've never been happier . I feel like I 've been handed a new life .
MEREDITH: The truth is if you 've had money you entire life , even if you despise it , which we do - agreed ? - you 're only truly comfortable around other people who have it and despise it .
RIPLEY: I know .
MEREDITH: I 've never admitted that to anyone .
RIPLEY: I do n't want too many large bills . Nobody will change them .
MEREDITH: Show me the other one again . I like them both .
RIPLEY: I 'll take them both .
JOAN: Can you bear it ? We hear you 're a friend of Freddie 's - he has I hate Opera < /i tattooed on his chest .
RIPLEY: There 's room for a whole libretto on Freddie 's chest .
JOAN: I 'm sure we 've met .
RIPLEY: Thanks , yes , I think we did .
JOAN: One minute you people are children and the next you 're getting tattooed .
MARGE: Oh my God . Tom .
RIPLEY: Marge , how are you ? What are you doing in Rome ?
MARGE: Is he here ? Are you with Dickie ?
RIPLEY: No . Hello , I 'm Tom Ripley .
PETER: Peter Smith-Kingsley . I 've heard about you , of course - from Marge , and Dickie .
MARGE: No glasses . He fishes out the glasses .
RIPLEY: Ditto .
PETER: Where are you hiding him ? He 's impossible , is n't he ?
MARGE: Is he really not here ?
RIPLEY: Marge , you know Dickie has I hate Opera < /i tattooed on his chest .
MARGE: You were going to Venice .
PETER: Yes , what happened ? I heard you were desperate to come . I was looking forward to rowing you around .
RIPLEY: I am . I really am . And I 've been travelling . I just ca n't seem to get that far north .
PETER: Well hurry , before we sink . Should I give you my telephone number in Venice ?
RIPLEY: Thanks .
PETER: Look there 's Meredith thingy - who 's that , Marge ? - they 're in textiles Meredith - God , how awful , I 've spent Christmas in her house !
MARGE: I do n't know her . He has n't called , he 's hardly written , just these cryptic notes . You do n't just dump people .
PETER: Will we see you later ?
RIPLEY: I ca n't later .
PETER: And tomorrow ?
RIPLEY: Tomorrow 's possible . Do you know Dinelli 's ? Piazza di Spagna ?
PETER: I know the Piazza di Spagna . What time ?
RIPLEY: Ten thirty ?
PETER: We 'll be there .
RIPLEY: Okay . Marge , see you tomorrow . It 's really good to meet you .
MEREDITH: I thought you were enjoying yourself ?
RIPLEY: Let 's take a Carozza and look at the moon .
MEREDITH: You 're crazy ! It 's freezing out there .
RIPLEY: C'mon , I need to talk to you . Just the two of us .
MEREDITH: Okay then , you 're crazy .
RIPLEY: You 're such a pal to understand . It 's as if Marge is here now - I look at you and I see her face - and I ca n't , whateve I 'm feeling towards you - I just ca n't
MEREDITH: No , I absolutely understand . Of course .
RIPLEY: Otherwise you 'd be fighting me off .
MEREDITH: Beating you away .
RIPLEY: Oh Meredith , I 'm sorry . Of course I 'll meet you . Let 's have coffee in the morning at Dinelli 's .
MEREDITH: I do n't - is that by the Spanish Steps ?
RIPLEY: Exactly . 10.30 -
MEREDITH: Peter ? Hello , it 's Meredith Logue .
PETER: Of course it is , Meredith , hello , I 'm sorry , half-asleep , how are you ? This is Marge Sherwood . Meredith Logue .
MARGE: Hello .
PETER: Join us , wo n't you ? We 're just waiting for a friend . Do you know , I wonder did we see you at the Opera last night ?
MEREDITH: I wo n't actually , although I think this might - are you waiting for Dickie ?
PETER: Well no , as it happens , although
MARGE: Dickie ? Do you know Dickie ?
MEREDITH: You were at the Opera ? Well , that explains - yes I was there . I was there with Dickie .
MARGE: I told you ! I knew it !
MEREDITH: Marge , I do n't know you , so I have no ight , but Dickie loves you . He 's - I think you 'll find he 's coming home to you .
MARGE: How would you know that ?
MEREDITH: He told me everything . I was supposed to meet him fifteen minutes ago , so II 'm going to go now , I think . Unless he meant
PETER: No , we 're meeting another friend . Tom Ripley .
MARGE: Do you know Tom ?
MEREDITH: Ripley ? No . I heard about him , of course , ut no , I did n't meet him .
RIPLEY: Sorry , sorry . Had to renew my papers . Italian bureaucracy - never one stamp when they can make you line up for three . Have you been waiting long ?
PETER: Not at all . Morning Tom .
RIPLEY: Hi . Sorry . You okay ? You look as if you 've seen a ghost
MARGE: Dickie was at the Opera last night .
RIPLEY: I do n't believe it . Wild horses would n't drag Dickie to -
MARGE: He was there with someone . So I suppose she must have dragged him - that 's not fair . I 'm going back to Mongi . I think Dickie 's coming home . I 'm going to go home .
RIPLEY: Really ? That 's swell . No , I was just - you 're way ahead of me ! Great !
PETER: We think he 's had a change of heart . So we should be celebrating .
MARGE: I hope so .
PETER: That was moving , was n't it ? When Meredith said - Meredith 's the American girl I saw last night , I know her , at the Opera , she 's een seeing something of Dickie -
RIPLEY: My God .
PETER: But the point is Dickie - well we know this - Dickie loves Marge and he misses her and apparently he 's come to his senses
RIPLEY: It 's fantastic . I feel guilty . Marge does n't understand this , but anytime Dickie does something I feel guilty .
SIGNORA BUFFI: Accendo il riscaldamento . i > < /i
RIPLEY: Mi piace suonare . i > < /i
SIGNORA BUFFI: Io sono sorda . Quelli di sotto , una coppia , sono sordi . Allora , ti piace ? i > < /i
RIPLEY: Hello ?
FREDDIE: Oh hello , where 's Dickie ? How are you ?
RIPLEY: Yes , I 'm good , thank you . Dickies at dinner . He 's at Otello 's . Do you know it ?
FREDDIE: I do n't think he 's at dinner at 6.30pm . If you said he was still at lunch I 'd elieve you . Incredible . The guy has disappeared off the face of the earth .
RIPLEY: I guess .
FREDDIE: The landlady - as far as I could tell , the landlady said he was here right now .
RIPLEY: He 's gone to dinner ! Search the place . I ca n't think why you would imagine Dickie would hide from you .
RIPLEY: What about Christmas ?
FREDDIE: He was supposed to come skiing . I did n't get a cable or a call or a note or , frankly , a fart .
RIPLEY: No . No , I 'm staying here for a few days , in Rome . That 's a new piano , so you prob -
FREDDIE: In fact the only thing which looks like Dickie is you .
RIPLEY: Hardly .
FREDDIE: Have you done something to your hair ?
RIPLEY: Freddie , do you have something to say ?
FREDDIE: What ? I think I 'm saying it . Something 's going on . He 's either converted to Christianity - or to something else .
RIPLEY: I suggest you ask Dickie that yourself . Otello 's is on delle Croce , just off the Corso .
FREDDIE: Is it on `` delle Croce , just off the Corso '' ? You 're a quick study , are n't you ? Last time you did n't know your ass from your elbow , now you 're giving me directions . That 's not fair , you probably do know your ass from your elbow . I 'll see you .
RIPLEY: Hey , if I 'm drunk , think what he husband 's saying .
ROVERINI: Dickie Greenleaf ?
RIPLEY: Yes ?
ROVERINI: Inspector Roverini . Can we come in ?
RIPLEY: I ca n't be absolutely sure - 8 ? 9 ? We 'd oth taken on far too many drinks - but it was dark , it was certainly dark when I walked him down to his car .
ROVERINI: So Signor Miles drove away and you did what ?
RIPLEY: I went to bed . Freddie 's a big man , but I 'm in trouble after a couple of drinks . I 've suffered all day . Who found him ?
ROVERINI: Senta . We have to ask you to stay in Rome .
RIPLEY: Yes , if it 's going to help , certainly .
ROVERINI: So , the Doctor , he has to make the - - come se dice ?
RIPLEY: Postmortem ?
ROVERINI: Yes , exactly , but his first , his first conclusion was that Signor Miles was killed not later than seven o'clock yesterday evening .
RIPLEY: Well , he certainly was n't dead when he drove off in his car .
ROVERINI: No .
MARGE: Did he kill Freddie ?
RIPLEY: Marge , when did you get here ?
MARGE: Tell me the truth . Did he kill Freddie ?
RIPLEY: I 'd swear he did n't . Of course he did n't .
MARGE: I tried again , waiting here , watching fo him . Instead it 's you . Whenever I look for Dickie I find you . What happened to your face ?
RIPLEY: Dickie did it .
MARGE: Dickie ?
RIPLEY: My face ! There was an argument . I said some things I should n't have . About you . About the appalling way he 's treating you , all of us . And the next thing I know he 's launched himself at me . Are you getting on ?
MARGE: What ?
RIPLEY: Get on . I 'll take you to him .
MARGE: Where does Dickie live ?
RIPLEY: We passed it a few blocks back , where the police were . The Palazzo Gioia . They do n't even know I 'm in Rome and I 'm not going to incriminate Dickie -
MARGE: Perhaps I should n't go either .
RIPLEY: No , well go if you want to , but do n't talk to the Police about my face - they find out he hit me - he 's got a temper - he could 've hit Freddie . Good luck , Marge . I 'll catch up with you later .
ROVERINI: Of course . What happened to your face ?
RIPLEY: My scooter . I fell off . Getting chased by photographers . He hurries up the stairs , Roverini in tow . RIPLEY The telephone , the press , I 've been , I 'm feeling hounded - do you think you could not give out my address ?
ROVERINI: Never . We 've had many requests and , of course , we say no - even to your fiancÈe .
RIPLEY: I really do n't want to see anybody .
ROVERINI: Even your fiancÈe ?
RIPLEY: Even her .
ROVERINI: What about Thomas Ripley ?
RIPLEY: What about Ripley ?
ROVERINI: You and Signor Ripley went to San Remo , is that right ? Ripley is appalled . He smiles .
RIPLEY: Yes , sure , we did go to San Remo . That was months ago .
ROVERINI: November , I thought .
RIPLEY: Was it ? Did you speak to Tom ?
ROVERINI: November 7th is my information .
RIPLEY: I do n't remember the exact date .
ROVERINI: And when did you last see Signor Ripley ?
RIPLEY: A few days ago .
ROVERINI: Does he stay with you here ?
RIPLEY: No !
ROVERINI: No . Here is a pattern . Two days ago Freddie Miles is dead - he leaves you apartment and is murdered . Yesterday a little boat is found in San Remo full of ocks , and the owner tells the Police it was stolen on November 7th . We look at hotel records and we see oh ! Dickie Greenleaf is staying in San Remo and then our boatman remembers two Americans taking a boat .
RIPLEY: It 's not a pattern , it 's a coincidence . There must be fifty hotels in San Remo , there must have been a hundred people enting a boat on that day .
ROVERINI: 31 people .
RIPLEY: 31 people .
ROVERINI: That is Miss Sherwood now . Marge Sherwood .
RIPLEY: Let her in , what 's the difference ? Let her in . No , actually , no , I 'd like it very much if you would ask her to come back later .
ROVERINI: May I askwhy would you speak to you friend and not your fiancÈe ?
RIPLEY: I think I just said . Ripley was handling some business for me , nor does Mr Ripley want to marry me . Nor did he ask me every day if I would marry him . And when .
ROVERINI: Do you have a photograph of Signo Ripley ?
RIPLEY: I 'm not in the habit of carrying around photographs of my male friends .
ROVERINI: Now I think I have upset you . My English perhaps is coarse .
RIPLEY: It is a little coarse , yes .
ROVERINI: Sorry . No-one has seen Signor Ripley since San -
RIPLEY: I have !
ROVERINI: You have , yes .
RIPLEY: No , I have and so has Miss Sherwood , ask her ! and if I could remember which hotel he was staying at - the Goldoni ! - Tom was staying at the Goldoni .
ROVERINI: Good . The Goldoni . Yes - you 're right . A coincidence . I look forward to our next meeting when I will be more careful with my English and persuade you to play me your saxophone . Alto .
RIPLEY: Absolutely .
ROVERINI: I have a witness who thinks they saw two men getting into Mr Miles ' car . She
RIPLEY: Tomorrow .
MARGE: Dick ? Dickie ? I know you can hear me . What am I doing , chasing you around ? I was going to say I would count to three and if you did n't open the door , but I wo n't count any more . On you . I wo n't count on you any more . Whatever it is , whatever you 've done or have n't done , you 've broken my heart . That 's one thing I know you 're guilty of , and I do n't know why , I do n't know why , I just do n't know why
PETER: I 'll see you over there !
RIPLEY: Peter , I 'm really sorry to put you through this . I just could n't face going to the police by myself when my Italian 's so rotten .
PETER: Do n't be daft . It 's fine . I 'm delighted you finally made it to Venice . I 'm delighted , contrary to rumour , you 're still in one piece ?
RIPLEY: What rumour ?
PETER: That Dickie murdered you and is travelling under your passport . I know , idiculous .
RIPLEY: It 's okay .
PETER: Anyway I 've got to the bottom of the delay . Finally . We 're waiting fo someone from Rome .
RIPLEY: What do you mean ? They 're sending someone from Rome ?
PETER: That 's good , is n't it ?
RIPLEY: No , but I thought that did n't happen in Italy , that each region was completely separate ! I was sure that was the -
PETER: You 've seen the papers , you know what a ig deal it 's been here . American tourist murdered -
RIPLEY: It 's ridiculous but now you 've mentioned the stench I can hardly breathe .
POLICEMAN: Colonelo Verrecchia della Polizia di Roma .
VERRECCHIA: Qui e Ripley ? Who is Ripley ? < /i
PETER: Lui . Him. < /i
VERRECCHIA: Ho assunto io la guida delle indagini in seguito alla negativa valutazione delle disdicevoli circostanze verificatesi con il mio predecessore Roverini che come e noto non e riuscito a impedire il verificarsi della scomparsa del signo Greenleaf , il quale era l'unica persona al momento passibile di incriminazione del reato di omicidio del signor Miles .
PETER: He 's taken over the case because they 're annoyed the previous chap let Dickiedisappear when he was the only , he was the only suspect in Freddie 's murder .
VERRECCHIA: Quando e stata l'ultima volta che il signor Ripley ha visto il signo Greenleaf ? i > < /i
RIPLEY: In Rome , about three weeks ago . I knew that one .
PETER: A Roma , circa tre settimane fa .
VERRECCHIA: Dove e stato il signor Ripley da allora ?
PETER: Where have you been since then ?
RIPLEY: I 've been backpacking .
PETER: I do n't know how to translate that . E difficile.il signor Ripley .dormiva all'aperto , con un
VERRECCHIA: All'aperto ? Col freddo che ha fatto ?
PETER: He thinks it 's very cold to be sleeping outside .
VERRECCHIA: Il signor Ripley ha sviluppate tendenze omosessuali ?
PETER: Are you a homosexual ? Interesting non-sequitur .
RIPLEY: No .
PETER: No . By the way , officially there are no Italian homosexuals . Makes Leonardo , Michelangelo very inconvenient .
RIPLEY: Tell him I have a fiancÈe , Dickie has a fiancÈe and Freddie Miles probably had a string of them .
PETER: Il signor Ripley ha una fidanzata , il signor Dickie ha una fidanzata e probabilmente il signor Freddie Miles ha molte fidanzate .
VERRECCHIA: Mamma mia , quante fidanzate ! They all laugh .
RIPLEY: What did he say ?
PETER: He says so many fiancÈes .
VERRECCHIA: Lei ha ucciso prima Freddie Miles e dopo Dickie Greenleaf ! Vero ?
PETER: He wants to know if you killed Freddie Miles and then killed Dickie Greenleaf ?
RIPLEY: No I did not . I did not kill Freddie Miles and then kill Dickie Greenleaf . Is he accusing me ? Ask him if he 's accusing me !
PETER: He 's already angry , I do n't think -
RIPLEY: Just because he does n't like Americans !
VERRECCHIA: Non e questo il luogo per le vostre conversazioni private ! < /i
PETER: A ragione . A ragione . < /i
VERRECCHIA: Hmm . C ' e questa < /i
PETER: They found this in Dickie 's place in Rome .
RIPLEY: You opened this ?
VERRECCHIA: Of course !
RIPLEY: It 's a suicide note . You ask me all these questions and you 've already read this suicide note ?
PETER: Can you imagine , if Dickie did kill Freddie , what must that be like ? To wake up every morning , how can you ? Just wake up and be a person , drink a coffee ?
RIPLEY: Whatever you do , however terrible , however hurtful - it all makes sense , does n't it ? inside your head . You neve meet anybody who thinks they 're a bad person or that they 're cruel .
PETER: But you 're still tormented , you must be , you 've killed somebody
RIPLEY: Do n't you put the past in a room , in the cellar , and lock the door and just neve go in there ? Because that 's what I do .
PETER: Probably . In my case it 's probably a whole building .
RIPLEY: Then you meet someone special and all you want to do is toss them the key , say open up , step inside , but you ca n't because it 's dark and there are demons and if anybody saw how ugly it was
PETER: That 's the music talking . Harder to be leak if you 're playing Knees up Mothe Brown .
RIPLEY: I keep wanting to do that - fling open the door - let the light in , clean everything out . If I could get a huge eraser and rub everything outstarting with myselfthe thing is , Peter , if
PETER: No key , huh ?
MARGE: Hello Peter , so good to see you .
RIPLEY: Hello Marge !
MARGE: Tom . They walk towards the Vaporetto . MARGE So you found Peter
PETER: I think we sort of found each other . Marge smiles enigmatically . Ripley registers . PETER Where 's Dickie 's father ?
MARGE: He 's not coming till the morning . Evidently his stomach - I do n't think the food here is agreeing with him .
RIPLEY: I was looking forward to seeing him .
MARGE: Dickie has n't killed himself . I 'm sure of that . There 's a private detective on the case now - a Mr MacCarron - Dickie 's father 's employing him .
RIPLEY: That 's a terrific idea .
MARGE: He 's American . He 's already discovered Dickie cashed checks for $ 1000 the day efore he disappeared . They step onto the Vaporetto . MARGE Is that what you do before you jump in the Tiber ? I do n't think so .
PETER: No , it 's Tom 's . Splendid , eh ?
MARGE: Golly . Who 's paying for this ?
RIPLEY: Peter found it for me . I can afford it ecause it 's damp and , and falling down .
MARGE: This is spectacular .
PETER: That 's why Tom wanted you to stay . It 's etter than squeezing into my room , and I know how you hate hotels .
MARGE: A hotel would 've been fine . We 'll have to tell Mr Greenleaf how fa his dollar has stretched .
PETER: What 's funny ?
MARGE: No , nothing . I 'm just thinking about when Tom arrived in Mongi . And now look at you .
RIPLEY: Look at me what ?
MARGE: To the manner born .
RIPLEY: Mr Greenleaf .
HERBERT GREENLEAF: Tom . How are you ? You look well .
RIPLEY: I 'm well , thank you .
HERBERT GREENLEAF: Far cry from New York .
RIPLEY: Yes it is .
HERBERT GREENLEAF: Marge , good morning . Unusual weather .
MARGE: Very .
RIPLEY: And you , sir ? Any better ?
HERBERT GREENLEAF: Pretty good . Sticking with hot water .
MARGE: Where 's Mr MacCarron ?
HERBERT GREENLEAF: San Remo . The police are amateurs . Well , my boy , it 's come to a pretty pass , has n't it ?
RIPLEY: Yes . What 's the detective hoping to find in San Remo ?
HERBERT GREENLEAF: He 's being thorough , that 's all . I 'm learning about my son , Tom , now he 's missing . I 'm learning a great deal about him . I hope you can fill in some more lanks for me . Marge has been good enough to do that , about Mongibello .
RIPLEY: I 'll try my best , sir . Obviously I 'll do anything to help Dickie . Marge looks at him in contempt .
HERBERT GREENLEAF: This theory , the letter he left for you , the Police think that 's a clea indication he was planning on doing somethingto himself .
MARGE: I just do n't believe that !
HERBERT GREENLEAF: You do n't want to , dear . I 'd like to talk to Tom alone - perhaps this afternoon ? Would you mind ? Marge , what a man may say to his sweetheart and what he 'll admit to another fellow -
MARGE: Such as ?
HERBERT GREENLEAF: What a waste of lives and opportunities and -
RIPLEY: I think it might hurt her to know .
HERBERT GREENLEAF: And his passport photo ? Did you hear ? To scratch out your own face like that - can you imagine - the frame of mind you 'd have to be in ? i > I 've thought about going to the police ut I ca n't face it . I ca n't face anything anymore. < /i
RIPLEY: I feel guilty . I feel like I pushed him away . I spoke and he heard you .
HERBERT GREENLEAF: Well , if we all pushed him away what about him pushing us away ? You 've been a great friend to my son . Everything is someone else 's fault . We all want to sow wild oars . Somebody 's got to - what 's the word ? The moment someone confronts him he lashes out . He lashes out . You know , people always say you ca n't choose you parents , but you ca n't choose you children .
RIPLEY: I 'm sorry . I was asleep . I must have fallen asleep .
PETER: You look ghastly , Tom . Are you okay ?
MARGE: Did Dickie 's Dad go ?
RIPLEY: He 's having an early night .
MARGE: Poor man . We were knocking on that door for ever . I think I 've broken my strap .
PETER: Not guilty .
RIPLEY: I 'll fix some drinks .
MARGE: You walk in Venice !
PETER: Are you okay ?
RIPLEY: I 'm fine .
PETER: Do you want me to stick around ?
RIPLEY: It 's okay .
PETER: Or I could come back .
RIPLEY: Marge , I 'm in the bath . Wo n't be long .
MARGE: I found Dickie 's rings .
RIPLEY: What ?
MARGE: You 've got Dickie 's rings .
RIPLEY: I can explain .
MARGE: Dickie promised me he would never take off this ring .
RIPLEY: Let me put on some clothes and then we can talk about this .
MARGE: I have to tell Mr Greenleaf . I have to tell Mr Greenleaf . I have to tell M Greenleaf .
RIPLEY: Marge , calm down , you 're being hysterical .
MARGE: He promised me . I swear I 'll never take off this ring until the day - < /i
RIPLEY: Shut up ! Shut up ! His towel slips off from his waist . RIPLEY I 'm wet , Marge , I 've lost my towel , I 'd eally like to put my clothes on . So go and pour us both a drink , will you ?
MARGE: I was looking for a needle and thread . I was n't snooping . I was looking for a needle and thread to mend my bra .
MARGE: Why do you have Dickie 's rings ?
RIPLEY: I told you . He gave them to me .
MARGE: Why ? When ?
RIPLEY: I feel as if you have n't heard anything I 've been saying to you .
MARGE: I do n't believe you .
RIPLEY: It 's all true .
MARGE: I do n't believe a single word you 've said .
RIPLEY: You 're shivering , Marge . Can I hold you ? Would you let me hold you ?
MARGE: Oh Peter ! Get me out of here .
PETER: Tom , are you okay ?
RIPLEY: You try . You try talking to her .
PETER: Tom . Tom ! Tell me , what 's going on ?
RIPLEY: I give up .
PETER: You ca n't be angry with her . She 's upset and needs someone to blame . So she blames you . I 'll go home and talk to her . As for you - either get a safety razor o grow a beard .
RIPLEY: Is Mr Greenleaf here ?
MACCARRON: Mr Ripley ? I 'm Alvin MacCarron .
HERBERT GREENLEAF: Marge , there 's female intuition , and then there are facts - < /i
RIPLEY: Hello , sir . Marge , you should have waited , did n't Peter tell you I 'd come by and pick you up ?
HERBERT GREENLEAF: Marge has been telling us about the ings .
RIPLEY: You know I feel ridiculous I did n't mention them yesterday - I clean forgot - idiculous .
HERBERT GREENLEAF: Perhaps you did n't mention them because there 's only one conclusion to be drawn .
RIPLEY: We could go down to the bar - no need fo you to -
HERBERT GREENLEAF: No , he should talk to you alone .
RIPLEY: I could probably see my bedroom from here . I can see my house . When you see where you live from a distance it 's like a dream , is n't it ?
MACCARRON: I do n't care for B.S . I do n't care to hear it . I do n't care to speak it .
RIPLEY: Okay .
MACCARRON: Why do you think Dickie 's father sent him to Europe in the first place ? Did you know at Princeton Dickie Greenleaf half- killed a boy ? Ripley turns , shocked .
RIPLEY: I hope she never knows .
MACCARRON: Three different people saw Dickie get into Freddie Miles ' car . A man who wo n't identify himself because he was jumping someone else 's wife at the time saw Dickie removing license plates from a red sports car . The Police know about this man because he happens to be a Policeman .
RIPLEY: I feel I never should have said those things to you the other evening . I was pretty flustered , the rings and - and you looked so , I do n't know . Marge shakes her head to silence him . RIPLEY But I hope that note goes to New York in your purse , for a rainy day .
MARGE: What are you going to do now , Tom ?
RIPLEY: I do n't know . Peter has a concert in Athens next month - and he 's asked if I want to go along , help out . He says goodbye by the way - he 's in rehearsal , otherwise -
MARGE: Why do I think there 's never been a Ripley rainy day ?
RIPLEY: What ?
RIPLEY: Oh Marge .
PETER: What do you want to change about this moment ?
RIPLEY: Nothing .
PETER: Hello . What are you up to ?
RIPLEY: All kinds of things . Making plans .
PETER: Plans - good , plans for tonight or plans for the future ?
RIPLEY: I do n't know . Both . My plan right now is to go up on deck , look at the sunset . Come with me .
PETER: You go . I do n't want to get dressed yet . Come back though . Come back . You know , you look so relaxed , like a completely different person .
RIPLEY: Well , that 's entirely your fault . And , if I fall overboard , that 'll be you fault too .
MEREDITH: Dickie ? Dickie ? He turns . He 's caught . Suddenly he 's Dickie . MEREDITH Dickie , my God !
RIPLEY: Hello Meredith .
MEREDITH: I was looking at you , your clothes , I would n't have known you
RIPLEY: Well , you 've spotted me and so you get the reward .

MEREDITH: Hardly . I could n't be less alone .
RIPLEY: Of course . Aunt Joan .
MEREDITH: And co. A lot of co. Oh , God , I 've thought about you so much .
RIPLEY: I 've thought about you .
MEREDITH: When I thought about you I was mostly hating you . Where 've you been hiding ?
RIPLEY: I have n't been hiding . I 've been in Police custody . They 've been trying to flush out Freddie 's killer .
MEREDITH: You 're kidding .
RIPLEY: They 're letting me have this vacation . Which is why the get-up . Which is why you have n't heard from me .
MEREDITH: You know , the whole world thinks you killed Freddie ? It 's terrible .
RIPLEY: I know . Look , I ca n't talk now . Later . Later ? He kisses her . Full of future .
MEREDITH: So - are you travelling under R ?
RIPLEY: You know what - I am .
MEREDITH: Dickie , are you with Peter Smith- Kingsley ? I bet you are . My aunt thought she saw him .
RIPLEY: Peter Smith-Kingsley ? I have n't seen him in months . No , I 'm alone .
PETER: How was it ?
RIPLEY: Good . But I think we should stay in here for the rest of the trip .
PETER: Was that Meredith ?
RIPLEY: Was who Meredith ?
PETER: Meredith Logue . You were kissing somebody . Looked like Meredith .
RIPLEY: Hardly kissing . Kissing off .
PETER: Did n't look that way - you know - from a distance .
RIPLEY: I lied . To her . She thought she 'd seen you .
PETER: Why lie ?
RIPLEY: Dickie and Peter , that 's just too good gossip , is n't it ?
PETER: Or Tom and Peter even .
RIPLEY: Well that would be even better gossip .
PETER: Really , why ? Sorry , I 'm completely lost .
RIPLEY: I know . I 'm lost , too . I 'm going to be stuck in the basement , are n't I , that 's my , that 's my - terrible and alone and dark - and I 've lied about who I am , and where I am , and so nobody can ever find me .
RIPLEY: I suppose I always thought - better to be a fake somebody than a real nobody .
PETER: What are you talking about - you 're not a nobody ! That 's the last thing you are .
RIPLEY: Peter , I I
PETER: And do n't forget . I have the key .
RIPLEY: You have the key . Tell me some good things about Tom Ripley . Do n't get up . Just tell me some nice things .
PETER: Good things about Tom Ripley ? Could take some time ! Tom is talented . Tom is tender Tom is beautiful

MISS MARTIN: You know he has . You 're not a complete fool , are you ?

MISS MARTIN: The rudeness of people in these parts is appalling !
BOB CLEWS: Doin ' yourself well these days , Stan .
STAN: A friend of mine was by an ' sold me a quarter of beef .
JACKSON: The same friend as sold you that hide Bob , here , found stashed in your barn yesterday ?
STAN: Hide What hide ?
BOB CLEWS: The one that might send you to the penitentiary .
JACKSON: What did you do with it , Stan ?
STAN: I never had no hide stashed
BOB CLEWS: I saw it yesterday under the hay .
STAN: Then it must still be there .
JACKSON: No it ai n't we looked Where is it ?
STAN: I tell ya
MISS MARTIN: What is all this ?
JACKSON: Afternoon ma'am . Miz Caldwell ai n't it ?

BOB CLEWS: Rustlin ' .

BOB CLEWS: Rustlin ' cattle stealin ' .
MISS MARTIN: Oh a thief
STAN: I tell ya I never
BOB CLEWS: Save it
JACKSON: Matter of fact Bob , here , says that the hide he saw yesterday had the K.C . brand on it .
MISS MARTIN: Oh hmmm well , what do you intend doing about it ?
BOB CLEWS: Law 's pretty harsh 'round here on cattle thieves .
JACKSON: Course , we do n't want to make a mistake with an old-timer , but
ROCKLIN: How about the owner of that beef might n't he have somethin ' to say about it ?
JACKSON: Meanin ' ?
ROCKLIN: Red Caldwell he 's the owner of the K.C. , ai n't he ?
BOB CLEWS: You 're 'way behind the herd , mister Red Caldwell died three weeks ago .
MISS MARTIN: Was murdered , you mean .
JACKSON: That 's right shot in the back not far from here .
BOB CLEWS: Maybe he was gettin ' on to things about the cattle that 's been missin ' from the K.C . lately .
STAN: I tell ya I ai n't never had any hide
BOB CLEWS: Well , you got beef
STAN: Yes an ' I got a bill of sale fe it , too . Jackson and Clews exchange a quick glance .
JACKSON: S'pose you let me see that bill of sale .
STAN: It 's right out here . Jackson follows , looking at the women .
JACKSON: Like I said I would n't want to make a mistake with an ole-timer .
DAVE: See that one ? She ai n't got no laigs .
MISS MARTIN: Hold your tongue . And you stop staring as if we were monsters .
DAVE: Where 's Stan ? We got to have anothe drink .
ROCKLIN: He 's outside tryin ' to explain away a hide .
DAVE: Eh ?
ROCKLIN: Seems we 're eatin ' stolen beef .
DAVE: Somebody 's loco . Stan might have given house-room to bit o ' dead beef , ut he 'd never be fool enough to leave the hide lyin ' around . How 'bout it , Zeke ?
BOB CLEWS: That 's the way it is , Dave .
DAVE: Oh it 's you .
BOB CLEWS: That 's right your old pal Bo Clews .
DAVE: Git away from me you two-timin ' horse thief .
BOB CLEWS: Them 's fightin ' words , pardner .
DAVE: Hey , Stan do n't let 'em hang nothin ' on you , you ai n't done . They 're just a couple of fourflushers the pair of 'em , everybody knows that .
JACKSON: Crazy drunk .
DAVE: Mebbe I am drunk mebbe that 's why I 'm tellin ' the truth I 'm drunk an ' I 'll say what I think I 'll say what I know .
ZEKE: So will I Jackson goes to Dave .
JACKSON: Do n't act up this ways , Dave They 's women watchin ' .
DAVE: Git your hands off me
BOB CLEWS: What he needs is a short lay-down .
ROCKLIN: I 'll lend a hand .
JACKSON: Me an ' Bob 'll look after him . We 're his friends come on , Bob . Careful now do n't hurt him .
ROCKLIN: How are things standin ' now between you an ' the law ?
STAN: All right , I reckon I guess this bill of sale kinda winded him . Rocklin 's lips curl in a wise smile .
ROCKLIN: Good thing you saved it .
MISS MARTIN: What are you doing ?
ZEKE: Musta been dreamin ' Thought I was sittin ' on a pot of gold .
STAN: There ai n't no gold here .
ZEKE: There ai n't even a pot .
ROCKLIN: How is he ?
JACKSON: Went to sleep soon 's we laid him down . Sorry to have a ruckus in front of you ladies . Dave 's an ornery old cuss when he gets goin ' No shape to drive on , I 'm afraid .
MISS MARTIN: Hmmm
JACKSON: Do n't worry , ma'am . Bob , here , 'll take you on in knows every inch of the road Do n't you ?
BOB CLEWS: You bet . Rocklin has been listening intently .
ROCKLIN: I 'm drivin ' .
JACKSON: But if anything was to happen to the ladies , I 'd feel to blame .
ROCKLIN: Do n't .
JACKSON: You ladies want he should drive ? Miss Martin hesitates .
BOB CLEWS: I 'll be more ' n glad to accommodate you
MISS MARTIN: He 's going with us anyway he may as well drive .
JACKSON: Anything you say , ma'am .
MEXICAN: Venga con migo , senor .

ROCKLIN: His friends , eh ?
STABLEMAN: What happened ?
ROCKLIN: Bumped his head .
STABLEMAN: Where on Iron Mountain ?
ROCKLIN: Where 's the best chance of a cheap oom ?
STABLEMAN: There 's Cap 's place across the Street the Sun-Up Saloon .
ROCKLIN: I 'll pick that up later .

ROCKLIN: Okay . You can book me a room , too .
DAVE: No laigs .
DOC RIDING: He 'll be all right in the morning . Rocklin closes door behind him .
ROCKLIN: Do n't mind if I do .
CAP: Will he make it ?
DOC RIDING: Sure he 'll make it . Ca n't kill off a salty old hairpin like Dave that easy .
CAP: You 're right . Reckon Saint Pete must be gitten ' mighty tired of dustin ' off that doormat for him . By the way , how did you say it happened ?
ROCKLIN: I did n't .
CAP: That 's right ; you did n't . Reason I ask is , a couple fellers was in saying how Dave was kickin ' up a ruckus up at Stan 's place . Sheriff Jackson it was and one of the Clewses .
DOC RIDING: Oh !
CAP: Tough customers , the Clewses .
DOC RIDING: Yeah do n't pay to start something with 'em you do n't intend to finish .
CAP: By the way , Doc , they tell me George 'll be out again . That 's Bob Clews ' brother . Jest done a stretch in pen 'tentiary for horse stealin ' .

CLINT: Come on , Doc . I still got to take something from you .
DOC RIDING: No more tonight , son . I 've a full day ahead .
GARVEY: How about you , sir ? Care to sit In ? I 'm warnin ' you , though our young friend here has been holding phenomenal cards . Rocklin smiles and begins to shake his head .
CLINT: Have a heart , Judge . This ai n't no two-bit saddle-tramp 's game . This is for real money .
GARVEY: Fine ! Oh this is Pap Fossler ; Shorty Davis ; Ab Jenkins ; Mr. Harolday , and my name 's Garvey Judge Garvey . I did n't get your name .

ROCKLIN: How 's your head ?
DAVE: Oh a mite hungover but I 'll feel better once I git downstairs .
BOB CLEWS: I knocked , but guess you did n't hea me .
ROCKLIN: What do you want ?
BOB CLEWS: Looks like you stirred things up around here last night , stranger .
ROCKLIN: That all you came to say ?
BOB CLEWS: No . I got a message for you . From Old Man Harolday . Wants to see you out front .
ROCKLIN: What about ?
BOB CLEWS: Maybe he wants to thank you fo teaching that pup of his a lesson .
ROCKLIN: I 'll be down .
DAVE: What 's goin ' on here ?
PAP FOSSLER: Arly Harolday 's on the warpath .
AD LIBS: Here he comes . Watch the fun . This should be good . Etc .
ARLY: Is your name Rocklin ?
ROCKLIN: Yes .
ARLY: I want that money you took from my other last night .
ROCKLIN: Are you crazy ? Or just ignorant ?
ARLY: You took it at the point of a gun and I 'm taking it back the same way !
ARLY: Stop ! You ! stop , or I 'll kill you !
ROCKLIN: Whiskey !
CLINT: What happened ?
ARLY: You lied to me , did n't you ?
ARLY: Do n't think I 'll forget this . Making a fool of me in front of the whole town .
DAVE: Boy , oh boy , was that a near thing ! She 'd just as soon have hit you as missed . You do n't know how lucky you were , son .
ROCKLIN: Do n't I ? Why d'you think I need this ?
BOB CLEWS: Funniest sight I ever seen .
ROCKLIN: Try another trick like that on me and it 'll be worse .
BOB CLEWS: I never played you no trick . You oke my wrist .
DAVE: Oh boy has somebody come to town !
ROCKLIN: Where 'll I find Judge Garvey ?
CAP: He rooms behind his office down the street . Do n't usually pull up the linds till around noon , though .
ROCKLIN: He will this morning . See you later , old-timer As he moves toward the door .
GARVEY: Oh , come in , Mr. Rocklin . Come right in .
ROCKLIN: I understand you were Red Caldwell 's lawyer ?
GARVEY: I was .
ROCKLIN: Know anything about this ?
GARVEY: I do n't understand . Job ? What job ?
ROCKLIN: Foreman .
GARVEY: On the `` K.C. '' ? But but why should he want you ?
ROCKLIN: Why not ? Good foremen do n't grow on ushes .
GARVEY: Is that your only motive for coming here ?
ROCKLIN: What other motive could I have ?
GARVEY: I do n't know It 's just that Red Caldwell was a peculiar man had a funny way of doing things .
ROCKLIN: Off ?
GARVEY: I do n't want to be too hard on you , ut as executor of the estate I have to consider the interests of the new owner . How about , say , a hundred in full settlement ?
ROCKLIN: Well
GARVEY: That 's my last word think it over .
MISS MARTIN: You are Judge Garvey , I presume .
GARVEY: Yes and you are
MISS MARTIN: Miss Martin and my niece , Clara Caldwell .
GARVEY: Of course of course
MISS MARTIN: What !
ROCKLIN: What do you mean claims to have ? You saw it , did n't you ?
MISS MARTIN: You ca n't hold us to account fo every promise made by that man . Everyone knows he was n't responsible for his actions half the time . And if you think I 'd have you as a foreman
ROCKLIN: Listen , lady I 'd rather walk fo somebody else , than ride for you .
MISS MARTIN: Well the impudence
ROCKLIN: All I come for this morning was to pay beck the hundred and fifty Red Caldwell sent in advance .
CLARA: Oh , no They all turn and stare at her .
MISS MARTIN: Do n't interfere , Clara . Of course he must pay it back .
ROCKLIN: The railway fare well , I reckon we can check that up against the time lost and call it quits .
CLARA: But , Mr. er I do n't know you name
ROCKLIN: Rocklin , miss .
CLARA: Mr. Rocklin , it is n't fair for you to pay anything back .
ROCKLIN: That 's how I 'd prefer it , If you do n't mind , miss never did care fer owing favors to no one especially women .
CLARA: Oh !
ARLY: I 've just heard they let George Clews out of penitentiary and that he 's headed this way . You might tell him from me , if he sets foot on the Santee Ranch , I 'll shoot him on sight .
GARVEY: But really , Miss Arly , why should you deliver your message through me ?
ARLY: You have mutual friends .
GARVEY: If you 're referring to Sheriff Jackson
ARLY: I am .
GARVEY: But that 's absurd . The fact that he employs one of the Clews brothers does n't make the other his friend .
ARLY: Have it your own way ; but it 'd be fair to warn him , because I mean it .
GARVEY: Oh , Miss Caldwell , this is Miss Harolday Miss Martin , Miss Caldwell 's aunt . You should know one another , seeing you 'll be neighbors . Miss Harolday runs the Santee Ranch for her stepfather . She 's a famous ah horsewoman in these parts .
CLARA: I know . I saw you ride into town this morning . You looked lovely . Just what I 'd like to be .
ARLY: Yes ?
CLARA: Oh , this is Mr. Rocklin . He drove us in from Garden City last night . He
ROCKLIN: I already met Miss Harolday .
CLARA: Oh .
ARLY: I 've a message for you from Harolday .
ROCKLIN: What , again ?
ARLY: He wants you to come down to the office .
ROCKLIN: What for ?
ARLY: He 's got a proposition to make about riding for him . Sixty a month .
ROCKLIN: Hmmm That 's a foreman 's wages .
ARLY: I would n't offer you a red cent . But it 's his money . And the way things are shaping , maybe we could do with somebody as mean as you around the ranch .
MISS MARTIN: I warn you , you 're making a great mistake . This man is no good .
CLARA: Auntie !
ARLY: Well ? D'you want the job ?
ROCKLIN: Lead the way .
CLARA: Auntie , why did you have to say that ? I simply do n't understand you
MISS MARTIN: But I understand you . I 'd be ashamed of myself . Throwing myself at a man like that .
CLARA: I I Oh , you 're horrid horrid . I wish I 'd never come .
MISS MARTIN: You must excuse her . She 's young .
GARVEY: And inexperienced . Garvey leans back in his chair and smiles .
MISS MARTIN: And young people must be protected from themselves at times do n't you agree ?
GARVEY: Exactly .
ROCKLIN: Does he always follow you ?
ARLY: He 's not following me he 's with me he 's always with me .
ROCKLIN: Oh just an old Indian friend .
ARLY: The best friend I 've got .
HAROLDAY: Why did you do it , Arly ?
ARLY: So I can fire him . I hate him . Clint and he quarrelled last night . Clint lied about it and I made a fool of myself . He 's outside now .
HAROLDAY: All right . Send him in . Arly goes to the door and opens it .
ARLY: Come in .
HAROLDAY: Mr. Rocklin , what happened between you and my son last night ?
ROCKLIN: Poker .
HAROLDAY: Hmmm . About this suggestion of you working for me .
ROCKLIN: It 's your suggestion , not mine .
HAROLDAY: Ye-es . Sixty dollars is big money .
ROCKLIN: If you 've changed your mind
HAROLDAY: No , no . Wait a minute . I take it you 've had the experience .
ROCKLIN: Enough for Red Caldwell to hire me as foreman .
HAROLDAY: Oh had Caldwell hired you ?
ROCKLIN: Yeah but I wo n't ride for the new owners so that leaves me open .
HAROLDAY: I see Were you a friend of Red 's ?
ROCKLIN: No I guess he just heard about me .
DAVE: George Clews is in town . He 's seen what you done to Bob and he 's a- lookin ' for you . They all look quickly toward the window .
HAROLDAY: The street is clear .
ROCKLIN: Tell him I 'll be out in the street in front of the saloon .
DAVE: Uh-huh !
GEORGE CLEWS: I 'm gon na get his ears .
DAVE: Hi you , George Clews George Clews turns .
SHORTY: That was my beer , you know .
GEORGE CLEWS: If he comes in again I 'll throw you .
CAP: That does it , boys you know where the door is .
GEORGE CLEWS: Com-mon I 'll get his ears .
CAP: Not until I get my money
GEORGE CLEWS: Pay 'im .
PAP: That Rocklin 'll kill him for sure .
CUSTOMER: Le 's hope .
GEORGE CLEWS: I 'm coming and you 'd better run !
ROCKLIN: Draw a gun and I 'll kill you .
JACKSON: Hey , you ! What 's this you been up to ?
ROCKLIN: I just laid a gun barrel over the head of a drunk friend of yours same as you did over Dave 's here yesterday .
DAVE: Eh ?
JACKSON: I do n't know what you 're talking about .
ROCKLIN: You 're a liar !
JACKSON: Now you lookee here , young feller . You go on talking that way and you 'll find yourself in trouble .
MISS MARTIN: I saw you . I saw you strike that poor man .
ROCKLIN: Yes , ma'am . As hard as I could .
MISS MARTIN: You ruffian , you ! Clara pulls her sleeve imploringly .
ROCKLIN: Now what was that you were sayin ' about Caldwell ?
HAROLDAY: You being hired by Red Caldwell only confirms what I 'd suspected he was getting ready to fight .
ROCKLIN: Fight ? Who ?
HAROLDAY: Organized rustling . Well at least that 's my belief . Red was no friend of mine . Too fond of taking the law into his own hands . But he had my sympathy . He 'd been harder hit than any of us . And on top of it all , he lost his foreman .
ROCKLIN: You mean , he quit on him ?
HAROLDAY: He was shot in the back with a ullet from the same caliber rifle as got Red .
ROCKLIN: Got any ideas ?
HAROLDAY: No Except that the man you just pistol-whipped is in on it somewhere . Pity you did n't kill him when you had the chance .
ROCKLIN: Say it do n't sound as if it 's goin ' to be too easy for them wimmen at the K.C .
HAROLDAY: Want to go back and work for them ?
ROCKLIN: No , sir . And I ai n't jumping at this offer o ' yours either because I do n't hold with working for wimmen .
HAROLDAY: Oh , you mean my step-daughter . Well do n't worry . She wo n't interfere with youRocklin I figure we 've een losin ' cattle over a place called Table Top it 's the back way into the Topaz Ranch and the perfect route for rustlers I 'm going to send you up to the line camp you do n't mind working a lone hand do you ?
ROCKLIN: I like workin ' that way .
HAROLDAY: Good be ready to move out this afternoon .
DAVE: now Pap I 'm givin ' you first call on me services . They 's lots of other folks lookin ' fer a good man , too you know . So if you want me , you better hurry and speak up because
ROCKLIN: I 'm riding for the Topaz Ranch .
DAVE: What ! Have you gone plumb loco ?
ROCKLIN: Good money sixty a month
DAVE: There ai n't enough money in this town to make it worth your while to work for that gal .
ROCKLIN: Be right with you . He goes into the stage of office , as we
CLARA: Good afternoon , Mr. Rocklin . Lovely day , is n't it ?
ROCKLIN: Reckon it is pretty nice . So you 're moving in on the `` K.C . '' eh ?
CLARA: We-el , not exactly moving in . You see
MISS MARTIN: Do you have to discuss our private affairs with every rag-tag-and-bobtail cow-person we meet , Clara ?
CLARA: Auntie !
ROCKLIN: Sorry if I butted in , ma'am . Jest passing the time o'day .
MISS MARTIN: We can do very well without it thank you . And you 're keeping your lady friend waiting . Rocklin looks quickly in the same direction .
ARLY: I thought maybe you 'd changed you mind again .
ROCKLIN: Nope .
ARLY: Juan 'll show you the bunkhouse . I 'll talk to you about your duties in the morning .
ROCKLIN: How far is the line-camp at Table- Top ?
JUAN: Twenty-five thirty mile .
ROCKLIN: I 'm moving out there first thing in the morning . Boss ' orders . Care to show me the way ?
JUAN: I will show you .
JUAN: The trail is straight ahead . You will find the cabin at the top . Adios , Senor .
ROCKLIN: Senor Romerez , it appears that you do not like me .
JUAN: Senor , that is true . I do not like you .
ROCKLIN: Why ?
JUAN: Permit that I offer you a cigarette .
DAVE: Hiya there .
JUAN: Buenos dias , Senor Dave . You have found new employer , eh ?
DAVE: Yeah . Haulin ' freight for ole Pap Fossler . Got a letter here for that crazy galoot , Rocklin . From the little Caldwell girl . Seems mighty took up about sumpin ' . Made me promise to deliver it personal .
JUAN: But Senor Rocklin is not here .
DAVE: Lordy he ai n't quit already
JUAN: I have just accompany him to Table- Top .
CLINT: Have you seen Arly ?
SHELLEY: No , suh , Ah did n't see Miss Arly today , but Ah seed her las ' night , and she shore was mad .
CLINT: 'Mornin ' , Arly Arly is coming toward Clint .
ARLY: 'Mornin ' , Clint .
CLINT: You must be feeling pretty good .
ARLY: Forget it .
CLINT: Forget it ?
ARLY: Tala .
CLINT: What is this ?
ARLY: What do you mean ?
CLINT: What do I mean ?
TALA'S VOICE: Good morning , Arliete .
ARLY: Good morning , Tala .
TALA: You have make yourself very pretty today .
CLINT: See what I mean ?
ARLY: Have my horse saddled and sent around ight away will you ? You can have that Rocklin bring it .
TALA: Rocklin is not here .
ARLY: He quit ?
TALA: He has gone to the line camp at Table Top .
ARLY: What ?
TALA: It was Mr. Harolday 's orders .
ARLY: Be quiet .
TALA: He has made the choice , Arliete . With your own eyes you saw it yesterday .
ARLY: Oh
TALA: And she , too , has opened her heart to him Already she has summoned him to her .
ARLY: What do you mean ?
TALA: Dave of the white beard carries a letter to Rocklin It is from her .
ARLY: How do you know that ?
TALA: I have just now met Dave , and he tell me . So now he rides to Table Top . Arly is quiet a moment .
ARLY: Oh , leave me alone .
HAROLDAY: Good morning , Julio morning Arly . Fetch my briefcase it 's on my desk . Julio exits .
ARLY: Did you send that Rocklin to Table- Top ?
HAROLDAY: I did .
ARLY: Well , let 's get things straight . This place was my mother 's now it 's mine and Clint 's It 's true you 've been helping out but the way things are going we 'll soon be able to pay you back every penny we owe . Meanwhile , I 'm running this outfit and I expect to give the orders .
HAROLDAY: You generally do .
ARLY: Why did you send Rocklin up to Table- Top ?
HAROLDAY: It seemed to me a good idea what with all this rustling going on
ARLY: Who 'd ever try driving cattle ove Table-Top ? Unless they were crazy .
HAROLDAY: I do n't agree with you . In any case if you must have it I 'd no intention of engaging a man at foreman 's wages just to gratify the whims of a jealous woman !
ARLY: You take care what you 're saying .
HAROLDAY: It 's you should take care , my dear . I 'm afraid there 's one man you ca n't awhide into jumping the way you want . You 've made a fool of yourself over him once . Better watch out you do n't do it again . He turns abruptly and walks off the verandah .
DAVE: Durn funny that storm quittin ' just about the time I get here .
ROCKLIN: No funnier than you sloggin ' through it , just to deliver a letter from a woman .
DAVE: Reckon I 'm gettin ' to be more of a fool the older I get .
ROCKLIN: Thought I 'd wait till mornin ' might be bad news an ' I would n't be able to sleep .
DAVE: Mmmm dineroo .
ROCKLIN'S VOICE: Forgive me if this letter is a trifle incoherent , but I am terribly worried and unhappy .
DAVE: Who would n't be livin ' with that ole screech owl .
ROCKLIN: I am desperately in need of help and advice from someone whom I feel I can trust , and I am appealing to you , because I regard you in the same way my Uncle surely must have . I heartily dislike and distrust Judge Garvey
DAVE: Huh Smart girl
ROCKLIN: But my Aunt seems to have suddenly evised her opinion of him , and now wants me to place all my affairs in the Judge 's hands and return east . Such is certainly not my wish .
DAVE: Looks kinda like she 's formed an attachment . Rocklin glares up to Dave .
ROCKLIN: I wanted so much to give ranch life a trial , but fear circumstances are against me , especially in view of the recent Indian trouble
DAVE: Indian trouble Good Lord , they ai n't been any Indian trouble around here in
ROCKLIN: You want to hear the rest of this ?
DAVE: Might 's well come this far .
ROCKLIN: I want to apologize for what took place this afternoon . And I am eturning the 150 , because I feel it is rightfully yours . You must take it . Faithfully yours , Clara Caldwell .
DAVE: Well what do you make of it ?
ROCKLIN: Somebody 's sure bustin ' to get he out of there .
DAVE: Indian trouble
ROCKLIN: Wonder why the old lady 's playin ' along ?
DAVE: Baaa Wimmen Who can ever figure 'em ? Got to admit though , I feel a mite sorry for the young'un nice little tyke .
ROCKLIN: Too nice for this country .
DAVE: She 's shore a pretty thing . Rocklin has been mulling things over .
ROCKLIN: Do n't know how I could help her even if I wanted to I do n't know any thing about this Garvey o Caldwell or
DAVE: Well , now I could mebbe help you out some , there Fact , I could tell you somethin ' 'bout ole Red that might be interestin ' .
ROCKLIN: You must have known him pretty well What kind of a man was he ?
DAVE: Caldwell ? The best cantankerous cuss but a real cowman , believe me He was a big feller , like yourself Fact , you coulda passed fer a blood relation , come to think of it .
ROCKLIN: Was the Judge and Red friends ?
DAVE: That 's what you 'd say . Garvey managed all Red 's business . Besides which they was regular drinkin ' pals played poker together most nights tho ' they do say Red got the worst of it .
ROCKLIN: Red was a gambler , eh ?
DAVE: Oh , yeah reckon a pretty poo one , tho ' still you 'd say him and Garvey was friends .
ROCKLIN: Anything ever happen to make you think they were n't ?
DAVE: Rock I 'm gon na tell you somethin ' I ai n't never told anybody .
ROCKLIN: Think you can trust me ? Dave grimaces his confidence .
DAVE: The last time I seen Red was the day he died In the pause Rocklin remains silent .
ROCKLIN: Marked cards .
DAVE: Reckon so . Seems Red found some cards and this paper in a coat one of his friends loaned him one night .
ROCKLIN: Whose was it ?
DAVE: Well , now that 's just what I asked ut all he said , was that it belonged to a good friend . Then he said he was n't waitin ' fer the next coach , ut was ridin ' over to see the district judge about it alone .
ROCKLIN: That 's when they got him .
DAVE: Yes , sir 'bout a mile or so from Stan 's place . A bullet in the back an ' his pockets empty .
ROCKLIN: How come you never told this before ?
DAVE: Who was there to tell ? Sheriff Jackson ? Him an ' Garvey 's thick as thieves .
ROCKLIN: How about what 's his name Harolday ? He 's no friend of the Judge 's , is he ?
DAVE: Hates his guts sure riles him to see young Clint hangin ' onto the Judge 's coattails . All the same , I jus ' decided to keep my mouth shut and my eyes open .
ROCKLIN: Even if it was Garvey Red was talkin ' about it do n't follow that he killed him .
DAVE: No general opinion is that it was ustlers .
ROCKLIN: Why would rustlers take the evidence Caldwell had with him ?
DAVE: Looks to me if you get the man who owned the marked cards , you get the killer .
ROCKLIN: Funny tho ' first the K.C . foreman then Caldwell an ' now these women .
DAVE: Lordy you ai n't thinkin ' somebody might try bumpin ' them ?
ROCKLIN: I 'm not so sure somebody has n't tried already Remember , when we stopped to change horses on the way Over from Garden City
DAVE: Shore you told me how Jackson and Clews tried to frame Stan .
ROCKLIN: Yeah . Like they wanted to be sure he 'd keep his mouth shut about something .
DAVE: And layin ' that gun across my skull an ' offerin ' to drive the coach themselves .
ROCKLIN: It was almost as if
DAVE: Will be if I ever get dry .
ROCKLIN: Lookit that
DAVE: Good Lord
ROCKLIN: Come on
DAVE: My team .
ROCKLIN: That 's not your team .
DAVE: Come on
ROCKLIN: No use he 's gone .
DAVE: Mebbe we winged him .
ROCKLIN: Not bad shootin ' .
ARLY: You think I did that ?
ROCKLIN: Sure to draw us away from here . You know , you cut it mighty close Good thing I ai n't got brains enough to fill it .
ARLY: I have n't minded a bit because I came up to fire you .
ROCKLIN: Oh I see .
ARLY: Get out of here get off the Santee and do n't ever come back .
ROCKLIN: Mind if I wait for Dave ? He ought to e along any minute Be funny if he winged that shadow of yours .
ARLY: If you mean Juan you 're loco . He 's not even up here .
ROCKLIN: You came up alone ?
ARLY: Yes .
ROCKLIN: Then who was that we took out after ?
ARLY: The man who shot at you .
ROCKLIN: Who was he ?
ARLY: I do n't know .
ROCKLIN: You mean you wo n't tell .
ARLY: I mean I do n't know Why should I lie to you ?
ROCKLIN: I guess you forgot you jes ' fired me .
DAVE'S VOICE: Hey , Rock
DAVE: He got away but guess what , I He sees Arly and pulls up abruptly .
ROCKLIN: You guess
DAVE: Fer a man who 's got a despise fe wimmin , you sure do get all snaggled up with 'em .
ROCKLIN: You work for Harolday ? The man nods .
HAROLDAY: I thought I sent you up to Table- Top .
ROCKLIN: That 's right .
HAROLDAY: What happened ?
ROCKLIN: Well , this , for one thing .
HAROLDAY: I told you you 'd regret letting that at Clews off so easy .
ROCKLIN: I been figgerin ' . Do n't seem easonable Clews was in condition to take that sort of chance alone Besides how could he have known I was up there that soon . And George Clews ai n't the only one I 've un contrariwise to in this town . There 's that Mexican , for instance .
HAROLDAY: Juan ?
ROCKLIN: He as good as told me yesterday that him and me was due for a run-in one of those days . And then there 's him ! Harolday looks sharply toward the window .
CLINT: I just heard that that Rocklin was
ROCKLIN: Was what ?
CLINT: Was shot at last night .
HAROLDAY: Mr. Rocklin was just telling me all about it . Any idea who might have done it ?
CLINT: Not me . Rocklin makes no reply .
ROCKLIN: All right . I believe you . But that do n't mean you could n't tell a thing or two as would help if you wanted .
CLINT: What d'you mean ?
HAROLDAY: Yes . What sort of thing would Clint here know about , that would help identify the man who tried to kill you last night ?
ROCKLIN: This for one .
HAROLDAY: Well , go on speak up . Did you ever see it before ?
CLINT: No . Course I did n't Quit riding me ! I do n't know nothin ' about it I tell you . Jest because I had a run-in with you over a game o ' cards , that do n't mean I 'd sneak up on you in the dark and
HAROLDAY: He means trouble . He turns from camera toward the desk .
CLINT: Aw , what do I care .
HAROLDAY: Listen , I never did have much use for you . You 're a poor specimen at the best ; but as a would-be bad man you 're nothing but a laughing stock . Why , the way you lied about that pouch just now would n't have deceived a six-year old .
HAROLDAY: All right , let it go at that . But I got myself to think of . It would n't suit me at all just now to have you shown up in public for what you are y that trouble-shootin ' cowhand . My advice to you is to get out of the district and stay out . You 'll find some money in the safe at the ranch . Take what you need and put the key in the desk drawer . Now get .
CLARA: Oh , Mr. Rocklin
ROCKLIN: Just got in .
CLARA: I feel perfectly awful , running afte you like this , but
ROCKLIN: You got trouble , eh ?
CLARA: My aunt found out I wrote you and made a terrible scene
ROCKLIN: You have n't signed everything ove to that Garvey , have you ?
CLARA: No and because I refused , Auntie said she would sign an affidavit that I 'm still underage , and then , as my guardian she can do what she likes .
ROCKLIN: Got anything to prove you 're not underage ?
CLARA: No but Mr. Garvey has a lette that would prove it . My aunt wrote it before we came out here .
ROCKLIN: S'pose we could get it ?
CLARA: He 'd never give it to me .
ROCKLIN: Wait here .
CLARA: Oh , please you You wo n't go getting yourself in trouble I I 'd rather give up everything I mean
GARVEY: That takes care of that Now , I 'll draw up an affidavit right away and everything will be taken care of as we want it .
MISS MARTIN: I certainly hope so it 's not myself I 'm concerned about
GARVEY: Of course not .
MISS MARTIN: I ca n't say I 'm very happy about doing this I only hope it works out for the best .
GARVEY: It 's the better choice of two evils now let 's see I , Elizabeth It is Elizabeth , is n't it ?
MISS MARTIN: Yes
GARVEY: Elizabeth Martin , of Danvers , Massachusetts , do hereby
ROCKLIN: That 's right .
GARVEY: Perhaps you 'd better come back later
ROCKLIN'S VOICE: I came for that letter . Miss Martin reacts .
GARVEY: Did you say letter ?
ROCKLIN: That 's right the one Miss Caldwell 's aunt wrote from out east sayin ' she was of age . Remember ?
GARVEY: No I 'm afraid I do n't .
ROCKLIN: My only interest is getting ' it .
GARVEY: You realize what this is , do n't you ? Robbing armed robbery at that . Rocklin pulls open the `` M '' drawer .
ROCKLIN: Open up .
GARVEY: Listens , you There 's nothing in there that 'd interest you .
ROCKLIN: I 'd like to make up my own mind about that .
GARVEY: All right I 'll open it just to convince you I 'm not hiding any letter .
ROCKLIN: These cards
GARVEY: Anything wrong in a man having cards in his possession ?
ROCKLIN: Depends on what kind they are 'specially when they 're under lock and key .
GARVEY: You 're taking those , I presume .
ROCKLIN: That 's right .
GARVEY: Now , you look here
ROCKLIN: You 're the one who better start lookin ' lookin ' for a way out fo killin ' Red Caldwell .
GARVEY: Caldwell
ROCKLIN: He found out about these and you went and killed him .
GARVEY: And you believe a story like that ?
ROCKLIN: I will until I hear a better one . I 'll just take this along the district judge at Garden City should e mighty interested .
DAVE: Say looks like you two been disagreein ' 'bout somethin ' He ai n't daid , is he ?
PAP FOSSLER: Not permanently , I do n't reckon . What happened , anyways ?
DAVE: You musta found out somethin ' .
PAP FOSSLER: I reckon the Judge did , too .
MISS MARTIN: Oh , dear dear are you hurt ?
GARVEY: Get out of my way
MISS MARTIN: Now do n't you use that tone of voice to me I 'll have you understand I
DAVE: Find out who owns that tobaccy pouch yet ?
ROCKLIN: No but get hold of Clint Harolday .
DAVE: Clint Is he in on it ?
ROCKLIN: Ca n't say for sure Bring him to the Sun-Up , and do n't take no for an answer .
ARLY'S VOICE: So now you know the truth . And if you think you can steal him away from me , you 're welcome to try it . Rocklin frowns and enters .
CLARA: Did you get it ? Rocklin closes the door .
ROCKLIN: No but I do n't think it 's gon na matter much you go on back to the K.C . and I 'll be out in the mornin ' and take you with me to Garden City to see the district judge .
CLARA: But I hate putting you to that trouble .
ROCKLIN: No trouble at all I 'm going anyway .
ARLY: You look like you 've been fighting .
ROCKLIN: What are you doin ' here ?
ARLY: I was just telling Miss Caldwell about well you and me .
ROCKLIN: What about , you an ' me ?
CLARA: I think I 'd better be going
ROCKLIN: Just a minute What all has she been tellin ' you ?
CLARA: Oh oh , really I 'd rather not
ARLY: Go ahead , tell him and I dare him to deny it .
ROCKLIN: Deny what ?
CLARA: That she was with you last night at the cabin in the mountains .
ROCKLIN: Well why should I deny it ?
ARLY: And did n't you make love to me ?
ROCKLIN: Make love to you
ARLY: You did n't kiss me I suppose ?
ROCKLIN: Did you expect me to deny that , too ?
ARLY: You see ?
ROCKLIN: Now , maybe you ought to hear what I 've got to say
CLARA: Please you need n't explain . Afte all , it really is n't any of my usiness , is it ?
ROCKLIN: You little
ARLY: That 's it start swearin ' Just like a man .
ROCKLIN: If there was n't a lady here , I 'd do more to you than swear .
CLARA: I do n't know how I can ever thank you for trying to help me . I do appreciate it ever so much Do n't think too harshly of me , will you I
ARLY: She 's lovely , is n't she ? So sweet honest , and helpless . Rocklin makes no reply .
ROCKLIN: You might 's well know right now that you or no woman is ever goin ' to get me .
ARLY: Do n't be so sure I do n't think I 'm doin ' so badly .
ROCKLIN: Do n't you ?
ARLY: Do n't you know ?
ROCKLIN: I know there ai n't a dirty trick you would n't play to get what you want .
ARLY: I always get what I want .
MISS MARTIN: Whatever is to become of you ?
GARVEY: Tell Miss Martin that I 'll take care of everything .
SAMMY: You take clare of evelything .
ROCKLIN: Come in
DAVE: Here he is , Rock . Caught him jist in time near the Santee . Headed fe out , I 'd say .
ROCKLIN: Sit down , Clint . How about goin ' down below an ' havin ' one on me ?
DAVE: Well , now that 's right thoughtful Holler if you need me . Dave exits .
CLINT: What 's this all about ?
ROCKLIN: It ai n't gon na do you any good to get all het up and tough , kid
CLINT: I told you once , I do n't know who owns that pouch and I do n't know who shot you .
ROCKLIN: Forget it that 's not what I want to talk to you about , anyway .
CLINT: Well , what do you want to talk about ? Come on , get it over with .
ROCKLIN: Clint I want you to tell me why Garvey murdered Red Caldwell
CLINT: Me ? No !
ROCKLIN: Oh yes you do . And you 're going to tell me all about it .
CLINT: I do n't know nothing , I tell you
ROCKLIN: Talk !
CLINT: I tell ya , I
ROCKLIN: Talk !
CLINT: No ! No , do n't !
AD LIBS: What happened ? Who is it ? Clint Harolday Etc .
PAP FOSSLER: Where 's Doc Riding ?
AD LIBS: Get the Doc . Hey , Doc He was down elow . Here he is .
DOC RIDING: Somebody better fetch Harolday .
CAP: Shorty 's already gone for him .
PAP FOSSLER: Better get Arly , too . A voice is heard from the hall .
VOICE: She was at the hotel a while ago .
PAP FOSSLER: He was only a kid .
JACKSON'S VOICE: What 's goin ' on here gang way
JACKSON: What 's the trouble here
ROCKLIN: Just a minute , now
DAVE: I believe you . His gun was layin ' over there on the floor when I come in and
ROCKLIN: No it was n't It was right in my hand like it is now . Dave winces .
JACKSON: If you did n't know him then who did ?
ROCKLIN: I do n't know But I 'm going to find out .
HAROLDAY: Where is he ? Where 's my boy ?
HAROLDAY: You murderer .
ROCKLIN: I did n't do it , Mr. Harolday .
HAROLDAY: Then who did ?
VOICE: He had a gun in his hand when we come in .
GARVEY: And I 'll bet it 's the same one the ullet that killed Clint came out of . Rocklin gives Garvey a hard , slow look .
HAROLDAY: Well , what do you say to that ?
ROCKLIN: He 's right .
GARVEY: You admit it .
ROCKLIN: Yeah but that still do n't say I killed him .
AD LIBS: Aw , take him away Liar Lock him up , Sheriff The yellow-bellied Etc .
ARLY: Why did you do it ?
ROCKLIN: I did n't .
GARVEY: He admits it was his gun that shot him .
ARLY: But you did n't fire it .
ROCKLIN: That 's right .
ARLY: What happened ?
ROCKLIN: Clint and me was having a bit of an argument .
ARLY: What about ?
ROCKLIN: About whether he was going to help clear up a few things that 's been othering me and some others 'round these parts . For instance who it was shot Red Caldwell .
JACKSON: Caldwell !
ROCKLIN: And the K.C . foreman . And who took that shot at me up at Table-Top last night . And why certain people are so anxious to get rid of the Caldwell girl .
PAP FOSSLER: How would Clint know about all that ?
HAROLDAY: He 's lying . He 's trying to cover up for killing my boy .
JACKSON: Quit stalling , Rocklin .
ARLY: Wait a minute he 's get a right to e heard . Well , we 're listenin ' .
ROCKLIN: Well Clint was getting ' all set to talk , when somebody snuck up along the verandah there and pulled the gun out o ' my belt and let him have it .
AD LIBS: What a story ! What an alibi ! String him up , the heel ! Etc .
JACKSON: You 'll have to think up something etter than that Rocklin .
GARVEY: Do n't be a fool , Rocklin . You know you ca n't get away with a yarn like that . Why do n't you save yourself and everyone else a lot of trouble y surrendering to the Sheriff ? Afte all , it is n't such a crime in these parts to kill a man in self-defense .
ROCKLIN: Self-defense ?
GARVEY: Everyone knows what Clint was like . He probably lost his head and pulled a gun on you , like he did at the Sun- Up that night . Was n't that it ?
ROCKLIN: No , that was n't it . And till I do what I got to do , I ai n't surrenderin ' to anybody least of all to you pal here . If I got to be shot for knowing too much , it ai n't going to be in the ack , in a framed-up jail-break .
ARLY: But if someone 's trying to kill you , why did n't they do it just now ? Why did they have to kill Clint ?
ROCKLIN: Guess they wanted to get Clint , too . Doin ' it this way they get us both . Clint first an ' me afterwards like I jus ' said .
PAP FOSSLER: Quit fancy talk . Who 's `` they ? ''
ROCKLIN: I might be able to tell you that later .
JACKSON: No you wo n't because you 're comin ' with me .
ROCKLIN: Am I ? The crowd tenses . Rocklin eyes them grimly .
HAROLDAY: Well , Sheriff you certainly are to be congratulated .
JACKSON: Look , Mr. Harolday you saw what happened
GARVEY: Never mind that Let 's get going for Garden City that 's where he 's headed for .
HAROLDAY: You sure ?
GARVEY: I 'm positive .
ARLY: Where do you think he 's gone ?
JACKSON'S VOICE: All right , men follow me
DAVE: I mighta knowed you 'd do somethin ' like this . What are we doin ' ?
ROCKLIN: Headin ' for the K.C .
MISS MARTIN: Now what is it ?
GEORGE CLEWS: The name 's Clews , ma'am Mr. Garvey sent us out
BOB CLEWS: Said you were expectin ' trouble with that Rocklin .
MISS MARTIN: I am . But I 'm wondering if you 're up to it . I noticed you did n't fare so well with him yesterday .
BOB CLEWS: He was drunk
GEORGE CLEWS: Yeah But I 'm sober now .
MISS MARTIN: Well , see that you stay that way .
GEORGE CLEWS: Do n't worry , ma'am I 've jus ' bin waitin ' to get even with that saddle- um . He opens the door .
BOB CLEWS: We 'll be close-by .
GEORGE CLEWS: You bet . They start out .
JACKSON: Seen anybody ridin ' hard for Garden City .
ZEKE: Bin on the road since sundown ai n't seen a livin ' soul be he man or beast .
JACKSON: He mighta taken the cutoff through Jaw Bone Canyon .
HAROLDAY: After that storm ? He 'd never make it .
GARVEY: There 's only one other place he might have gone the K.C .
JACKSON: You think so ?
GARVEY: I 'm positive .
HAROLDAY: That 's what you said before .
JACKSON: To the K.C. , men .
ARLY: Take me through the canyon .
JUAN: It is dangerous , senorita .
ARLY: But if we get through we 'll beat them to the K.C .
JUAN: You would risk your life for Seno Rocklin ?
ARLY: Afraid ? Julio nods his head slowly , deliberately .
JULIO: Only for you you must not do this I will go through from here alone .
ARLY: No , we 're going through together .
ROCKLIN: You can ease up now .
DAVE: We 're just about there .
BOB CLEWS: Hey , George George , get up .
MISS MARTIN: You vile , ungrateful strumpet unning away in the night , like a deceitful sneak-thief
CLARA: Yes I 'm running away and it 's all your fault you 're the one who 's been deceitful and sneaking and do n't think I do n't know what you intend doing .
MISS MARTIN: And do n't think I do n't know what you intend doing .
CLARA: I do n't care I 'm not ashamed of it and nothing you can say or do is going to stop me .
MISS MARTIN: You little fool if you go to Garden City with that man you stand to lose everything .
CLARA: But why ? Why are you being so secretive ? If you know something , why do n't you tell me ?
DAVE: Yeah why do n't you ? Rocklin quickly shushes Dave .
MISS MARTIN: All right , I 'll tell you Rocklin is a nephew of the late Mr. Caldwell . And , as nearest of kin , he stands to get everything according to the will . Because you are not the old man 's niece , but only his grand-niece .
CLARA'S VOICE: And you and Mr. Garvey knew the truth all the time ?
DAVE: And you knew the truth all the time , too did n't you ? No wonde you stuck around
ROCKLIN: Get in here and take care of her .
GEORGE CLEWS: Come on They move out .
JULIO: You are crying , senorita ?
ARLY: No .
JULIO: It is too bad we lose your horse . She was good horse , for sure .
ARLY: If only we make it in time .
CLARA: And I heard one of them tell my aunt not to worry , that he was just as anxious as she was to get even with you .
DAVE: This is the only way I could handle her .
ROCKLIN: The Clews are around here some place Garvey sent 'em out .
GEORGE CLEWS: You bet we 're around .
BOB CLEWS: Untie her .
GEORGE CLEWS: Now tie him up .
MISS MARTIN: I 'll take part in this you you hairy beast .
MISS MARTIN: Help me get her to the bed .
GEORGE CLEWS: What 'll we do with 'em ?
MISS MARTIN: Take them in to Mr. Garvey and tell him I must see him at once .
BOB CLEWS: We 'll dump them right in the Judge 's lap .
MISS MARTIN: Had n't you better tie him , too ?
GEORGE CLEWS: Get some more rope . Bob hurries to do so .
GEORGE CLEWS: What are you doin ' with that gun , Arly ?
ARLY: Get down from there before I show you .
ARLY'S VOICE: Neither is it yours Get down out of there before I knock you down .
ARLY: And they 're headed this way and should get here any minute
ROCKLIN: That belongs to the man who shot at me on Table-Top Dave found it .
ARLY: You 've got to get away they 'll be here they 'll catch you
ARLY: You 've got to stop him he 's got to get away .
DAVE: Come on let 's git goin '

DAVE: Back at the house
ROCKLIN: We 've got to get her .

ROCKLIN: Come on
DAVE: Stubborn as an ole mule . You 're puttin ' a rope around you neck Dave runs after Rocklin .
ARLY: Get him out of sight , and follow me .
DAVE: But what 'll we do with the ole lady ?
ROCKLIN: Anything you like .
DAVE: I 'd like to pizen her .
ARLY: Look .
MISS MARTIN: If you 'll just take this you 'll go to sleep
JACKSON: Evenin ' ma'am hate to bother you like this , but
MISS MARTIN: I 'm so glad you 've come , Mr. Garvey , the most awful Why what are all these people doing here ?
GARVEY: We 're after Rocklin has he been here ?
MISS MARTIN: Oh yes here and gone .
JACKSON: What !
GARVEY: Gone
MISS MARTIN: Yes the two men you sent out are taking him and that horrid old man ack to town .
GARVEY: The Clewses funny we did n't see them .
JACKSON: Somethin ' musta gone wrong We etter fan out and see what 's goin ' on .
MISS MARTIN: Do n't leave , Mr. Garvey I 've got to talk with you , privately
GARVEY: But , madam
MISS MARTIN: It 's very important .
HAROLDAY: We 'll go on and meet you in town .
GARVEY: Perhaps you 'd better . I 'll meet you in town , Jackson .
JACKSON'S VOICE: Right come on , men .
GARVEY: And you 're positive he knows everything ?
MISS MARTIN: Absolutely everything He was standing at the window all the time the scoundrel .
ROCKLIN: You better get back on the bed in case they come in here . Clara tiptoes away .
MISS MARTIN: If you were to ask me , I think the est thing to do is Garvey stops and glares .
GARVEY: I 'm not asking you and do n't bothe me with your silly questions we 've got to do something besides talk .
MISS MARTIN: You mean you have to do something . Garvey stops and looks at her again .
GARVEY: My idea that 's all you know about it .
ROCKLIN: If there 's anybody else in on it speak up , Judge .
MISS MARTIN: Well I do declare She can say no more .
ROCKLIN: Talk . Miss Martin opens her mouth , about to speak .
DAVE: Not you .
ROCKLIN: Ever see that before ?
GARVEY: No it 's not mine .
ROCKLIN: Tell me whose it is .
GARVEY: No no I do n't know
ARLY'S VOICE: Drop that gun .
ARLY: He was just getting ready to finish you off , through that window .
ROCKLIN: You seem to like to do business through windows , Mr. Harolday .
ARLY: By one bad chance Juan saw you do it . Harolday looks at Juan , who slowly nods .
ROCKLIN: Well , now we 're gettin ' some place
ARLY: That pouch is his Juan made it for him a long time ago . Did n't you ? Juan nods .
ROCKLIN: Why did you kill Caldwell ?
GARVEY: Harolday wanted the K.C . like he wanted the Santee and the Hardman place , for his land scheme He planned on breaking up the ranches into small holdings and selling to dirt farmers . He pretended to be on the outs with me so I could get Caldwell 's confidence . And when Red caught me with the crooked cards and threatened to expose me Harolday shot him .
ROCKLIN: Why did he kill Clint ? An ' not me ?
GARVEY: That shot was an accident it was meant for you . We planned on getting the women to let me handle thei usiness
MISS MARTIN: And do us out of everything You vile wicked despicable
ROCKLIN: When he wakes up we 'll have him put everything on paper .
DAVE: Well , you 'll have to do the writin ' 'cause I do n't know how to write .
CLARA: Oh , Mr. Rocklin please I think Auntie is out of her mind she 's in her room laughing .
DAVE: What that ole pelican needs is a good spankin ' .
ARLY: And I 'll bet you 're just the one who can do it .
DAVE: Yeah I believe I am . I know I am .
ROCKLIN: I guess there 's no rush for you to get to Garden City , now
CLARA: No I do n't suppose there 's any ush
ROCKLIN: That means you 're goin ' back East Cousin Clara ?
CLARA: It 's where I belong I know that now
ROCKLIN: It 's good to know where you Belong , I reckon Wish I knew .
CLARA: I can tell you you belong with her
ROCKLIN: Thanks .
ARLY: For what ?
ROCKLIN: Everything . There is another stilted pause .
ARLY: Beautiful day .
ROCKLIN: It did n't start out so beautiful .
ARLY: That 's true of lots of things .
ROCKLIN: Fer instance ?
ARLY: Well you and me .
DAVE: Hey , Rock Rock get out you pencil and paper The two stop abruptly and look o.s .
GLEN: Crap .
CASEY: ` I 've been wearing the wrong size all my life , ' said Katie . ` I was always popping out . Turns out I 'm a 30GG , ' she says . ` Now my bras finally fit - though Simon prefers me without one . '
BETH: Do you think I should be reminding them to drink enough ? It 's very hot out there
MARY: Beth - they 're writers , not babies . You run round after ` em too much .
BETH: Can I tempt you , Glen ?
GLEN: Wow , thanks . Glen picks up a scone .
BETH: I often take something snacky down to Nicholas at this time of day . I know how the brain needs feeding . How are you settling in ?
GLEN: Great . The last writer 's retreat I stayed at kind of froze my balls off , you know ?
BETH: Oh .
GLEN: Screeching firedoors , curried lasagne and a needy poet - from whom I still bear the scars .
BETH: We try to keep it peaceful here ; far from the madding crowd .
GLEN: Well , it 's paradise .
CASEY: Frock horrors . This weeks top of the shocks goes to Katie Pound in an off the shoulder lime by Roberto .
JODY: She looks like a bug . Wankers !
CASEY: You wan na sack your stylist girl .
JODY: Bet they did that on purpose , dressed her up like an insect . Casey agrees . They zoom away .
GLEN: Perfect harmony .
NICHOLAS: In Ewedown ? Nadia , what the ffff are you doing there ? I have n't told her yet .
NADIA: Why not ? You keep saying you want to be with me . Jody and Casey are all ears .
NICHOLAS: I ca n't tell her just like that . It 's twenty five years ; a marriage .
NADIA: Come on Nicholas . Or I 'm going to get in a taxi and find your farm . Come up there and -
NADIA: Drag you out -
NADIA: I want to be with you . I thought you 'd be pleased
NICHOLAS: Of course I 'm pleased Nadia , go to the pub and stay there . I 'll come when I can .
NADIA: Are you going to tell her ?
NICHOLAS: Just give me a couple of hours -
BETH: How 's the worker ?
NICHOLAS: Good actually . Just about to embark on forensics .
BETH: Well give me your pages and I 'll get started . Nicholas hands her several pages .
NICHOLAS: Reckon I might pack it in a bit early today . Need to think about my lood smears . Might take a drive ; have a pint . Stir the old grey matter up .
BETH: Who were you talking to just then ?
NICHOLAS: Judy . She says the Impala contracts should be through in a day or two .
BETH: I could come with you .
NICHOLAS: What ?
BETH: For a drive . I do n't know when we last went out . Buying time by biting his scone
NICHOLAS: This is absolutely yummy .
BETH: We could go into Hadditon , get a meal .
NICHOLAS: Yes but . What about the guests ?
BETH: Mary 's got Casey to help .
NICHOLAS: But I 'm supposed to be thinking , you know about the -
BETH: You can run it by me . I 'm good at forensics . Nicholas has run out of excuses .
ANDY: Needs an expert yokel , does he ?
BETH: Would you mind ? And the writers are eating al fresco tonight ; could you check there 's no bird shit on the seats ? Sorry . Beth looks distant , troubled .
ANDY: You OK ?
BETH: Yes . Nicholas and I are going out to dinner .
GLEN: It 's paradise
JODY: Fucking bingo ! Jody and Casey run away , laughing .
TAMARA: What a dump .
JODY: We could walk up the garage .
CASEY: I 'm supposed to be helping my mum up at Stonefield .
JODY: They keep you busy .
CASEY: Yeah .
JODY: You never stop , you !
GLEN: It was called ` From Hearth to Heath - Doomsday and Revelation in Victorian verse . '
TESS: What was it about ?
GLEN: Oh you know . Pale poets on laudanum , dark towers and sunless seas - a little sturm and drang in a teacup .
TESS: Did it sell ?
GLEN: Well my kind of books are n't about sales . I mean that 's not why I write . So no .
TESS: What are you working on next ?
GLEN: Thomas Hardy .
DIGGORY: Is there anything left to say about that maudlin bore ?
GLEN: Excuse me but there is nothing dull about Hardy . That is a misconception .
TESS: At least you 've been published . I 'm seething with envy ; I 'd love to be published .
EUSTACIA: I publish myself on the internet .
TESS: Oh , do you earn money doing that ?
EUSTACIA: No .
GLEN: So what do you write ?
EUSTACIA: Lesbian crime .
CALLING: Beth , why do n't I just pop out on my own ?
BETH: But I 'm ready . Come on . She 's on her way to join him .
NICHOLAS: Is that - I mean - are you wearing that ?
BETH: Oh .
NICHOLAS: Just looks a bit hot .
BETH: Who is she ?
NICHOLAS: What ? For a moment , he tries to find a lie .
BETH: Tell me . Who ?
NICHOLAS: Look , it 's nothing . It 's been once or twice , that 's all . Beth , it 's not anything . Beth is raw with pain .
BETH: Who is she ? !
NICHOLAS: Just a researcher with Radio 4 .
BETH: What 's her name ?
NICHOLAS: Nadia , Nadia Patel . This hits a nerve .
BETH: Patel ? She 's in your book .
NICHOLAS: No , no I met her when I was on Desert Island Discs .
BETH: You put her in your book !
NICHOLAS: Just the name .
BETH: And Desert Island Discs was a yea ago .
NICHOLAS: Yes but -
BETH: Once or twice ?
NICHOLAS: I was going to tell you but - Beth utters an inchoate cry .
TESS: Shhh ! Beth 's pained voice drifts out of the house .
BETH: How can you lie to my face ?
NICHOLAS: Can we talk calmly about this ? There are people out there -
BETH: You look me in the face and LIE !
NICHOLAS: For God 's sake ; we 're surrounded by
BETH: You BASTARD !
NICHOLAS: Beth , we 're like a pair of compasses
BETH: Do n't you dare -
NICHOLAS: Joined solidly at the top but with the ends able to roam , in freedom - His phone beeps .
BETH: That 's from her is n't it ? Are you keeping her waiting ? Nicholas finally snaps .
NICHOLAS: We 've talked a lot about the creative mind and we agreed that it needs freedom to explore !
BETH: Take your freedom . I ca n't live like this any more . It makes me feel WORTHLESS !
NICHOLAS: Calm yourself down !
FIRMLY: This is pointless .
BETH: Is she young ?
NICHOLAS: For heaven 's sake .
BETH: Liar . Glen cringes . Beth slams the door .
DIGGORY: I did n't know they provided material too .
EUSTACIA: Beth does everything for him you
EUSTACIA: She even came up with the name D Inchcombe .
DIGGORY: No wonder he 's bored .
EUSTACIA: I hope she takes him to the fucking cleaners .
GLEN: At the end of the day , this is why I 'm glad to be single .
TO CAMERA: Why would he choose me ? !
TESS: Will she take him back , that 's the question .
EUSTACIA: Would you ?
TESS: I 'd be torn .
EUSTACIA: He 's far too up himself .
TESS: What about the farm though ? Splitting up all this ? Must be worth a fortune . I think she 's very rash , making him choose
NADIA: Thought you were n't going to come .
NICHOLAS: I was busy . Rowing with my wife .
NADIA: Where are we going ?
NICHOLAS: Home .
NADIA: To your farm ?
NICHOLAS: We could have gone on just as we were .
NADIA: But you said you wanted to be with me
NICHOLAS: Yes . In London . Now and then .
TAMARA: Big glass of rioja please . And I need a room .
ZOE: Sure , how many nights ?
TAMARA: Do n't know . Just one .
ZOE: You here on business ?
TAMARA: No . Business of a kind .
ZOE: I do n't mean to pry ; I 'm just eally nosey .
TAMARA: I 'm from here . Sort of .
ZOE: Nice place . Tamara smiles her disagreement .
TAMARA: My mum 's house is just up the road .
ZOE: You 're not staying with her ?
TAMARA: She 's . She died . Zoe finishes pouring the wine .
ZOE: Have that on me . And here 's you key . Up the stairs , right in front . You ca n't miss it .
ANDY: Bit of an atmosphere at Stonefield .
ZOE: Tell me everything Andy shakes his head .
ANDY: Marriage . Remind me never to try it .
ZOE: Andy , you 're just a sex object . No one 'd have you . He grins back at her .
GLEN: So the Hardiments have lived here centuries , huh ?
ANDY: No , ` bout twenty years . Still strangers by local standards . Beth comes in , tense , anxious and haggard .
BETH: Andy , come and look at Ingrid . I think she 's coming into heat . She goes out .
GLEN: She 's a nice lady .
ANDY: Yeah , I owe her a lot .
GLEN: Husband 's a sleazebag , huh ?
ANDY: We 'd say prick here actually . O wanker .
GLEN: That 's good . We might even call him a Fuck .
ANDY: That 's good too .
BETH: This is going rotten underneath .
ANDY: Shall we look at Ingrid ?
BETH: It 's falling apart .
ANDY: I can do that . Beth Andy takes the shovel . Beth bites back tears .
NICHOLAS: I told you . I love my wife . Do n't ever phone me again . Glen is shocked by this duplicity .
BETH: Not good enough . Not any more .
NICHOLAS: I 'm sorry .
BETH: You do what you like and then you 're sorry ?
NICHOLAS: Drove her back to London . Took all night .
BETH: You drove her home ?
NICHOLAS: She was in a state .
BETH: Do you think she 'll get over it ?
NICHOLAS: I 'm sorry .
BETH: I 've got to go to the bottle bank .
NICHOLAS: OK Let 's talk later .
BETH: Yes . The goat 's come into heat .
NICHOLAS: Has it ?
BETH: I love you so much .
NICHOLAS: Me too .
GLEN: I 've just seen the Hardiments kiss and make up .
IRRITATED: The hat is on .
GLEN: Looks like she 's taking him back .
DIGGORY: When the hat is on , it means do n't speak .
WITH IRONY: So Peace is restored .
GLEN: I do n't like cows . I mean really . They exude bovine malice .
ANDY: Yeah , these girls are killing machines . They do n't like Americans either .
GLEN: Very funny .
ANDY: It 's Winnards Farm . Lady there died a while back . Place is empty .
GLEN: You think it 's being robbed ?
ANDY: Prob'ly just kids . Nothing to do ound here except make trouble .
GLEN: What if it 's bad guys ? Do n't you have a blunderbuss or a fowling piece or something ? They climb up through a copse .
ANDY: Used to belong to my dad , this place .
GLEN: Really ?
ANDY: But it all went tits-up . Land was flogged to a consortium and the house was sold to Londoners ; the Drewes .
GLEN: So this is your ancestral pile ?
ANDY: Was . Born in that room up there . He points up at the back bedroom window .
GLEN: You must have been pretty resentful .
ANDY: Hey .
TAMARA: Andy , you moron ; it 's me .
ANDY: Tam ? Hardly recognise you .
TAMARA: Then help me !
ANDY: Used to do bits of work for your mum . Been keeping an eye on the place since she died .
TAMARA: What sort of work , graphics ?
ANDY: I do horticulture now .
TAMARA: You 're a gardener ?
GLEN: This is a great old house .
TAMARA: Would you like to buy it ?
GLEN: I 'm not really the property-owning kind . Prefer my life to fit into hand luggage .
ANDY: That 's why you 're back , to flog it ?
TAMARA: Yes .
ANDY: Make a nice second home for some anker wankers .
TAMARA: Andy if you want it , why do n't you make me an offer ?
ANDY: Because sadly I 'm still prey to the economic forces that threw the peasant classes off the land .
TAMARA: Unlucky .
ANDY: Tam . Their eyes meet .
GLEN: How was she before ? What 's the story ?
ANDY: There is n't one .
GLEN: Come on .
ANDY: Was nothing . Decade ago . Just a teenage thing .
TAMARA: You stupid prick . Andy looks at her . She is sincere .
ANDY: You saying you love me , frosty tits ?
TAMARA: You first .
ANDY: You say it ; You 're the girl .
TAMARA: Fuck off . She kisses him . As they start to make love
GLEN: Romeo and Juliet , huh ?
BETH: Thinking of the first time we saw this place
NICHOLAS: You 've made it a wonderful home Beth .
BETH: Not wonderful enough .
NICHOLAS: If you ca n't put this behind you , then we 're stuck .
BETH: Well I 'd better sort myself out then .
NICHOLAS: What has to happen ? I am sorry -
GLEN: Just taking the air .
JODY: Would you do him ?
CASEY: No .
JODY: What about him ?
CASEY: He 's gay , you dobbin .
JODY: So ?
CASEY: Swipe .
JODY: Ben Sergeant I 'd walk through fire to do him .
CASEY: The drummer ?
JODY: He 's not just the drummer . He writes the lyrics ; it 's his band . He 's the fucking genius , not Steve Culley o any of these wankers . It 's Ben .
CASEY: OK . I 'd do Ben .
JODY: I wan na be her , in that dress with him licking my teapot lids .
CASEY: Yeah me too .
DIGGORY: People talk about the muscularity in prose . I want a similar muscularity in my verse . I do n't want a poetry that 's flabby or obese - that 's why I adhere to the tightest rhyme schemes
NICHOLAS: So has the muse shone on you , Greg ?
GLEN: I 've been pretty distracted . Most ecently by those delicious cookie things that Beth brought round this afternoon .
NICHOLAS: Oh yes . Of course we call them iscuits here .
GLEN: And by the place itself , the people .
NICHOLAS: Sometimes wish I could get distracted . Ten page a day man , ain or shine .
GLEN: Wow , that 's scary . Ten pages ; how do you do that ?
NICHOLAS: Well , Greg -
NICHOLAS: I would n't presume to give an academic tips .
GLEN: Matter of fact I read one of you ooks . Another distraction but I thought it was decent stuff .
NICHOLAS: Well . He 's offended .
GLEN: ` We call them biscuits , here . ' Nicholas raises his glass for a toast .
NICHOLAS: To the muse , however you find her .
GLEN: That 's Tamara Drewe .
NICHOLAS: No it is n't .
GLEN: I met her with Andy .
NICHOLAS: Good God . What 's happened to her ?
POPPY: She 's had a nose job , Dad .
NICHOLAS: She 's completely different .
GLEN: That 's what Andy said .
BETH: Poor Tamara . Such a sad girl . She used to come and help you wash the car , did n't she Nicholas ? I think she liked a bit of family after he dad left .
TESS: Is that Tamara Drewe who writes the column in one of the Sundays ?
BETH: Used to . Writes for the Independent now .
TESS: She spent weeks going on about he nose job . Smart way to pay for it I suppose . Was her old one an awful conk ?
NICHOLAS: Yes .
BETH: She 's poured herself into those shorts . I hope they do n't give he thrush .
TESS: What 's the etiquette with nose jobs ? Do we mention it , or
TAMARA: Hello . Sorry to intrude .
POPPY: Hey , Tamara .
TAMARA: Poppy , how are you ?
POPPY: Love your new hooter .
TAMARA: Thanks . It is n't actually new ; just smaller
BETH: Tamara , so sorry about your mum .
TAMARA: Thank you
BETH: Are you staying down for a while ?
TAMARA: I 'll have to . There 's so much to be done .
BETH: You must let us know if we can help .
TAMARA: Actually , I was going to ask if you could spare a pair of strong arms . I 've got a skip coming tomorrow and -
BETH: Nicholas ? -
GLEN: I 'm available . I do skips .
DIGGORY: I No .
TAMARA: Well thank you . You 're very kind Is Andy around at all ? Beth is helping Nicholas wipe his trousers .
BETH: Oh , I ca n't spare Andy . He 's making a new coop for my Buff Orpingtons .
POPPY: Ca n't believe what a difference her nose makes .
BETH: Well I think it 's a mistake ; taken away all her character .
POPPY: Come on ; she looks ten times etter .
NICHOLAS: Huh .
BETH: And she knows it . I found those shorts really irritating . Going around with half her bum hanging out . I mean , why ?
POPPY: To annoy people like you . Might get a pair myself .
NICHOLAS: Of course you wo n't .
POPPY: Why not ?
NICHOLAS: Because you 're not desperate , are you ? Always something a bit desperate about Tamara Drewe . Beth looks at him puzzled as he works on .
GLEN: So why did you change your face ?
TAMARA: Changing my face is the best thing I ever did . And I do n't care what anyone thinks .
GLEN: Would it work for me ?
TAMARA: Maybe ; if you did the wrinkles too .
GLEN: Oh , you 're just coming on to me Tamara laughs . She starts work again .
TAMARA: No But it feels right . My first novel 's definitely going to be autobiographical .
GLEN: Your first novel ? You 're going to dash one off just like that ?
TAMARA: Ideally , I 'd like to make it into fiction before I 'm thirty .
GLEN: And then maybe a swimwear collection , a chat show , a pasta sauce range ?
TAMARA: What ?
GLEN: Life sure is easy for the beautiful .
TAMARA: You know before I got the nose jo I had no trouble getting taken seriously . Maybe , when they removed that bit of cartilage , they pulled my brain out by mistake - what do you think ? Glen smiles , won over .
GLEN: She 's single , man . Andy looks over at Zoe .
ANDY: Well it 's not exactly a elationship ; we just have an occasional thing . Zoe does n't want to be tied down and -
GLEN: Not Zoe ! Tamara You should get in there . Marry the girl . Then you get to live back in your ancestral home .
ANDY: No way . Not her type .
GLEN: The trouble is Andy , you think like a loser . And I know that because I 'm the loser that losers turn to for tips . I 'm the losers loser .
ANDY: I 'm a pedigree loser . I had a graphics business ; went bust . And then with my great business acumen I invested in a polytunnel full of ganja .
GLEN: Wow . How 'd that go ?
ANDY: Made a tit of myself . Spent about six years stoned out of my box and I 'm only just getting it back together . Besides , even if I was the last man in the world , Tamara Drewe would n't have me .
GLEN: Why not ?
ANDY: I dumped her .
GLEN: Oh , you are a loser .
ANDY: I was twenty . My mates thought I was cradle snatching And they used to call her Beaky .
TAMARA: Beaky ?
GLEN: You told her the truth The time might come when she respects that . Andy , as your love guru , I suggest you ask Tamara for a date . But take a shower first , OK ?
SMILING: Piss off , Glen .
TAMARA: Boys know nothing .
NICHOLAS: Have you ?
TAMARA: The bit where Doctor Inchcombe finds himself having thoughts about the dead guy 's daughter .
NICHOLAS: What ?
TAMARA: Have you noticed me ? Nicholas looks at her in surprise .
NICHOLAS: Think it 's time you went . Tamara is mortified .
TAMARA: Nicholarse .
GLEN: A man can dream , huh ?
ANDY: Go on Ingrid ; have some kids .
TAMARA: Pretty direct is n't he ? He 's not even bought her a coke . Andy turns . Sees her .
ANDY: She does n't mind ; it 's like Lynx to her . If she 's ready she 'll stand fo him , if not she wo n't .
TAMARA: That 's disturbing human .
ANDY: Refreshing basic . Darcy is up and at it .
TAMARA: I wish . Looks like I 'm stuck here fo a while . Actually , I 've got a proposition for you . Andy glances at the goats ; bad idea .
ANDY: We should go for a drink sometime , Tam . You know , for old times sake .
TAMARA: So we can reminisce about how I smashed your nose ?
ANDY: You did n't smash it .
TAMARA: Yes I did .
ANDY: It just bled . The memory is between them .
TAMARA: I 've got to do the house up before I sell it . It looks like an eighties timewarp . Would you like the job ? He just looks at her .
ANDY: It ca n't be easy down there , Tam .
TAMARA: What d'you mean ?
ANDY: All the memories and stuff . You mum
TAMARA: I 'm fine .
ANDY: Is it that you want someone around ? Like when you look up I 'd be there too ?
TAMARA: Jesus Christ , the goats are giving
ANDY: OK it 's bollocks -
TAMARA: That 's very sweet of you Andy -
ANDY: Of course you would n't want to fraternise with your gardener .
TAMARA: So is that a yes ? Andy does n't reply .
GLEN: No . He stands . He paces . He sits .
BETH: How 's Thomas Hardy ? Glen unburdens himself .
GLEN: I 'm wasting my sabbatical .
BETH: Oh dear .
GLEN: I 've been working on this book forever ; why ca n't I finish it ? I 'm two years past my delivery date and Fantail could ask for thei chickenshit advance back . I ca n't write . I 'm fucking constipated . It 's a disaster .
BETH: Crikey . He notices the In-Tray .
GLEN: You 'd do that ?
BETH: Be glad to . If you think it would help .
GLEN: Barging in on you ; What an idiot .
BETH: If you 're going into Hadditon - we 're really low on chicken feed .
ANDY: I 'll get it tomorrow . I 'm on my way down to Winnards . Doing one or two jobs for Tamara .
BETH: She 's got you helping her too ?
ANDY: Just painting , decorating , sorting the garden . Beth is quite put out .
BETH: Andy , that sounds like a lot . I need you here .
ANDY: I can easily do both .
BETH: As long as you 're not working fo her in the hours that I pay you .
ANDY: Sure , Beth . I wo n't rip you off .
TAMARA: What would you choose for in here ?
ANDY: Well I 'd have this one . And then upstairs in the bedroom -
ANDY: So what d'you have to do to get a cup of tea round here ?
TAMARA: Make it .
SHE GRINS: I 'm off to work .
JODY: This is our village . Our fucking field .
BEN: Sorry people . I resign . Swipe is no more . Steve Culley is a cunt .
PUBLICIST: Ben ! Ben ! What 's happening ?
BEN: He 's seeing Fran . I wo n't work with that tosser again .
FRAN: Steve ! Do n't !
STEVE: You fucking baby .
TAMARA: Hello . I 'm Tamara Drewe .
BEN: What ?
TAMARA: I 'm supposed to be interviewing you - for the Independent . She smiles sweetly , smoothing his hair .
JODY: They should let us in free .
RYAN: Too right . They come here , drink ou water , use our fields , they leave all their crap in our drains -
JODY: Ben ! Ben !
CASEY: What are you doing ?
JODY: That was Ben from Swipe ! Ben ! !
BEN: That 's Boss .
TAMARA: Hi Boss .
BEN: You 're not allergic are you ?
TAMARA: To indie drummers ? Maybe . Who are your influences , Ben ?
BEN: Everyone asks that . This your place ?
TAMARA: I 'm selling . D'you want it ?
BEN: No , I want something else .
JODY: Who the fuck 's she ?
CASEY: I seen her up at Stonefield . She 's got a nose made of plastic .
JODY: How come she gets Ben ? I 've loved him since March .
CASEY: Wow
TAMARA: Would you like a beer ?
BEN: Yep . Maureen Tucker .
TAMARA: Who ?
BEN: Moe Tucker , with the Velvets . Five foot nothing . Used to stand up to play . Put the snare drum on its side and hit it with mallets . Mentalist .
TAMARA: You write all the songs ; that 's pretty rare for a drummer .
BEN: Everything you 've ever heard about drummers is total shit .
TAMARA: You mean you do n't spontaneously combust ?
BEN: Only sometimes .
ANDY: Hey , hey - who are you , mate - lost , are you ? Andy strokes Boss .
NICHOLAS: How goes the opus ?
GLEN: Fine Nicholas , just fine
BETH: Oh he does n't .
GLEN: Yeah . Falls in mystical love . Hardy was like that in his life , too . Even as he aged , he only had eyes fo young women . Like , in one essential way he never grew up .
BETH: In his trousers .
GLEN: He was still at it in his eighties . You know ? Snow on the rooftop but fire in the cellar
BETH: Why wo n't it come for you Glen ? The way you talk about it 's so engaging .
GLEN: Yeah but there 's an academic style , you know ?
BETH: Who are you writing for ? Who 's you ideal reader ?
GLEN: Really ?
BETH: Yes . If you wrote like you were talking to a friend Pass me that thing .
NICHOLAS: I simply pander to popular taste .
CAITLIN: Oh your books are far more than that .
NICHOLAS: Just airport fodder
CAITLIN: Your prose is so vivid . And Inchcombe - for all his flaws - is a man with total integrity .
GLEN: Who did you base him on , Nicholas ?
IGNORING GLEN: My books do n't say anything profound . I ca n't pretend to be an intellectual - not like Glen here , illuminating our ignorance with his critical glow - but I do love prose . And I think I can turn a reasonable story .
GLEN: Excuse me .
BETH: They need dusting with this .
GLEN: I went to my room and I wrote fo three hours . The time just vanished .
BETH: That 's great , that 's brilliant .
GLEN: I feel like a man who 's just passed a gargantuan stool .
BETH: Super . Sprig of mint on the top .
NICHOLAS: The real secret of being a write is learning how to lie .
GLEN: ` The basis of all excellence is truth . ' Samuel Johnson .
BEN: Are you done yet ?
TAMARA: I 'm just starting something .
BEN: That poxy column ? Ca n't it wait ?
TAMARA: Not the column . Just stuff coming out . Do n't want to stop it .
BEN: Do it later . Play with me .
CASEY: He must like kissing plastic .
JODY: He does n't love her . He 's just on the rebound from losing Fran ; numbing his pain with loads of empty , rampant sex . What he really needs
CASEY: Is a fifteen year old from Ewedown .
JODY: So ? Stranger things happen . He 's only ten years older and that 's nothing . If he met me , if he just met me
CASEY: It 'd be love , right ?
JODY: Yeah .
SHE GRINS: But I 'd settle for sex .
BETH: Coo-er In your parents ' bedroom ? Still I suppose being an exhibitionist is part of his job - strutting about on stage .
ANDY: He does n't strut ; he 's a drummer . He sits on his arse .
BETH: Very good-looking , is n't he ? Poppy You-Tubed him and we both got quite hot and bothered . Is that his car - the yellow Porsche ?
ANDY: Yep .
BETH: Bit brash , vrooming through the village But fancy our Tamara agging a bone fide rock star . She was such an ugly duckling . She must e thrilled to bits .
ZOE: We 're not open for another hour .
ANDY: Good .
ZOE: I 'm going to move on soon , Andy .
ANDY: No way
ZOE: Do n't know if I can stick a winte here . The way the light disappears ; it 's doing me in . I 'm a blue sky girl . Got to have some warmth .
ANDY: We all need a bit of that , do n't we .
NICHOLAS: Fuck Soup .
TAMARA: What 's this ?
BEN: What 's it look like ?
TAMARA: Ben For which finger ?
BEN: Whatever one you like . That 's a nice one . Why not put it on that ?
PENNY: Those girls could have aborted !
BETH: Calm down , Penny . I 'll sort him out . Nicholas is approaching .
PENNY: It beats me why you people want to live in the country . You 've got no sense of responsibility .
BETH: It 's not our dog !
NICHOLAS: Hello , Penny . How 's tricks ? Penny is suddenly all coy .
PENNY: Oh - Nicholas
NICHOLAS: You 're looking great . Terrific coat .
PENNY: What , this old thing ?
NICHOLAS: You look like royalty .
PENNY: Well , I try Ca n't wait for you next book . Inchcombe 's such a sauce- pot . Giles is always says ` What are you reading Penny ? You 've got steam coming out of your ears '
TAMARA: So what 's the ring saying , Ben ?
BEN: It 's saying hello I 'm a ring . Will you marry me ? Tamara looks at him , searchingly .
TAMARA: I did n't know .
BEN: Did n't know what ?
TAMARA: That you were in love with me .
BEN: The ring says I 'm platinum with a long guarantee . So give me a reply . Tamara is grinning from ear to ear .
TAMARA: You 're the best fun in the world . I 'd love to marry you . She throws her arms around his neck .
BEN: Say what ?
TAMARA: I love you .
ANSWERING IT: What ? She 's being proposed to .
BETH: Shhh ! There are writers here , trying to write .
NICHOLAS: The famous Ben - Swipe , eh ? Ben just about manages to shake it .
BEN: Swipe 's over . Thought the whole world knew that .
NICHOLAS: It was n't on Newsnight , no .
BETH: Ben is engaged to Tamara . Is n't that lovely ? He 'd just popped the question when I rang .
NICHOLAS: She said yes ?
BETH: We 're delighted for you both . Boss leaps up , straining against a chain .
BEN: Why 's he on a chain ?
BETH: He was out of control .
BEN: How 'd you like to be chained up ?
BETH: He was chasing livestock . He could 've got shot .
BEN: They shoot him ; I 'll fucking shoot them .
NICHOLAS: I think the word is gobshite .
BETH: I hope he makes her happy . It 's hard for girls when their dads walk out . Gives them bad taste in men .
NICHOLAS: What 's that supposed to mean ?
BETH: Just saying her father left when she was a girl and -
NICHOLAS: That is ten pence psychology ! You do n't know what you 're talking about , do you ?
BEN: ` Mai Buff Orpingtons . Oh , the written word . That 's what the country does to you ; turns you into one . What 's up ?
TAMARA: It 's a shame it does n't fit . Perhaps you should have taken one of mine with you when you went to buy it .
BEN: Yeah but I did n't know you then .
TAMARA: So when did you buy it ?
BEN: So ? It 's yours now . She never wore it . She did n't want it .
TAMARA: You asked her to marry you ?
BEN: It was a gesture , OK , when she started seeing Steve . Backfired , anyway . Look , I love you now .
TAMARA: Do you ?
BEN: Yeah . With my whole heart . And all the other stuff . Like my brain and my entrails and my whatever , pancreas . It all wants to marry you .
BETH: She wondered if you had a delivery date in mind . I told her Easterish . Mind that cocoa , it 's hot .
NICHOLAS: Uh huh .
BETH: Come in soon , my love .
CASEY: Look at that cellulite
JODY: She been sitting on a bead car-seat or what ? Casey turns a page .
CASEY: ` Her latest tattoo count was nine , including a Sumatran tiger and ` Eternity ' written in Sanskrit . '
JODY: She 'll be getting a barcode done next . Right across there .
CASEY: Nice baby though . I 'd like one that colour .
JODY: What a dick .
CASEY: I think he 's cute .
JODY: No you do n't . Would you snog him ?
CASEY: Maybe .
JODY: Be like having a slug in your mouth .
RYAN: Wankers .
JODY: Come on .
CASEY: What if she 's got an alarm ?
JODY: Soon find out .
CASEY: What if they come back ?
JODY: If you 're too chicken , go home .
NICHOLAS: Is that Claire with an ` i ' ?
BETH: What about you , Glen ? Where will you e ?
GLEN: In London with a collection of spare academics . I guess we 'll be decking the halls in our own erudite way .
BETH: I 'll miss our chats .
GLEN: I 've been in a state of writerly liss these last weeks . I hope I get to come back .
BETH: Me too . We 'd love to have you . Glen does n't want Beth to move away .
GLEN: If it was possible to have an orgasm from mere food , this mince pie would do it .
EMBARRASSED: Golly .
BEN: What the fuck are we doing here ?
TAMARA: It 's kind of research ; I want to write about them . They 're funny , Ben - come on . They move through the crowd .
POSH HIPPY: So I 've got her this gorgeous Rajastani gagara skirt Arriving at the mulled wine .
TAMARA: Besides , I want to show you off .
BEN: What am I - arm candy ?
TAMARA: More like arm fungus with that face on . Ben , meet Glen . Glen , meet Ben , my fiance .
GLEN: You 're getting married ?
TAMARA: Uh huh .
GLEN: OK. Beautiful dress , magazine photoshoot - everything the aspiring novelist needs .
TAMARA: I knew you 'd be pleased .
GLEN: Have a mince pie .
BEN: Can we get out of here ?
TAMARA: Wait .
ARMY GEEK: In Field of Tares , you made Fred a corporal . But there 's no such thing in the Royal Artillery . They call them bombardiers .
NICHOLAS: Oh , thank you for that
TAMARA: Sorry .
NICHOLAS: So I hear . You have my heartiest commiserations , Tara .
TAMARA: Well merry Christmas . Nicholarse . She turns away .
JODY: We got ta live the dream , Casey . Live the dream
CASEY: Omigod !
JODY: Go ! Go ! Go ! She nicks the T-shirt .
BEN: Why do n't you sell it like you keep saying ?
TAMARA: Because I 've started writing .
BEN: You can write anywhere .
TAMARA: But this is proper . Not just stuff for the paper . 'It 's about my teens - and is working for me here .
BEN: Well it might be memory lane for you ut it 's doing my fucking head in . I want London . I want some Urban , OK ? Are you with me or what ? Cos I 've had it with this place . Tamara is hurt - and deeply disappointed .
TAMARA: Of course I 'm with you
BEN: It 's drab . It 's depressing . And every time I look out of the window I see Andy 's arse - what 's that about ?
ANDY: Yep .
BEN: Can I have one ?
ANDY: Right now ?
BEN: Yeah . Andy smirks , pointing at a big white duck .
ANDY: That one 's spare .
BEN: Is that a goose ?
ANDY: You can take it now if you like .
DISGUSTED: Oh come off it .
ANDY: What ?
BEN: It 's fucking alive .
ANDY: Oh , you want it from Tesco , all plucked and headless sitting on a andage . Ben 's curiosity gets the better of him .
BEN: How d'you do it then ?
ANDY: Gently put it 's head down there ; then quick in the skull with an air rifle . Pluck it while it 's warm , little pot to catch all the blood -
BEN: Do you enjoy doing that ?
ANDY: No , but in my low wage economy , this flock 's worth a lot .
BEN: You 're a sick fuck , Andy . Andy has had enough .
ANDY: Grow up .
SQUARING UP: What did you say ?
ANDY: I said grow up , little drummer boy .
GLEN: Why does the asshole always get the girl ?
ANDY: Come on . Or you 'll miss that train .
JODY: It wo n't be just a shag , Case . It 'll e an event . I 'll be wearing like a gossamer slip with a bra bit ; Prada . Or like a filmy , linen shirt , and
CASEY: I like this .
JODY: What ?
CASEY: There 's this bit right , where her dad takes her for dinner and she thinks it 's some big treat but what he 's doing , right , is telling her he 's leaving them . And she , right , she 's gutted and she yaks all her food into a napkin and puts it on his plate .
JODY: So ?
CASEY: It 's painful . But funny . It 's about her ; Plastic Fantastic . She 's sad , Jode .
JODY: Sad ? She 's a lucky cunt .
ANDY: So what about the shed ?
TAMARA: I do n't know ; the shed What do you think ?
ANDY: I recommend preserving it .
TAMARA: Really ?
ANDY: Always useful , a good shed .
TAMARA: Well then . Keep it
BETH: Really ? Oh dear
JUDY: Beth , hello love .
BETH: I 'm so sorry , I think Nicholas has got his phone turned off and um -
JUDY: He 's right here . I 'll put him on .
BETH: Oh - actually - do n't worry - I 've just found it .
SHOCKED: What are you doing ?
JODY: Just messing . I got one from Mum , one from that peanut Ryan , and a mystery one from Ben .
CASEY: I sent you that .
JODY: It 's my mum 's ; they do n't drink this shit . She hands it to Casey .
CASEY: No you are not !
JODY: From her address .
CASEY: He 'll think it 's from Tamara , you dipshit .
JODY: But I know it 'll be from me . Subject Hot Love .
CASEY: Oh God , Jody
JODY: Contacts where are you Ben ?
CASEY: Look , there 's that bloke my mum works for ; Nicholas Hardiment .
JODY: Let 's put him on . Who else ?
CASEY: Uncle Andy .
JODY: Andy Cobb . ` Come to Winnards Farm . I 'll give you the biggest shagging of your life . Love Tamara xxx . '
CASEY: Do n't ever , ever send that .
JODY: I just did . Casey is appalled .
CASEY: You never ! Jody nods .
JODY: No I wo n't .
CASEY: She 'll know someone 's read all he stuff !
JODY: I 'll delete it from sent items . It 's just a laugh , Case . I only want Ben to come back .
BEN: What the fuck is this ?
BETH: ` Come to Winnards Farm . '
ANDY: ` I 'll give you the biggest shagging of your life '
ZOE: She must want a foursome . O something .
TAMARA: How many times ? I did n't send it ! Are you listening to me ? BEN ! WILL
BEN: Explain it then .
TAMARA: Is this about Fran ?
BEN: What 's Fran got to do with it ?
TAMARA: She 's the reason you do n't trust me . Just because she fucked around on you it does n't mean that I will .
ANDY: It 's OK , it 's OK
TAMARA: Can you go to the farm ? Just take a look , see if anyone 's been in .
ANDY: No problem .
TAMARA: Thank you . Ben 's really pissed off . He 's massively got the hump -
BEN: Have I ?
TAMARA: Got to go . Sorry . She puts the phone down .
BEN: Are you thick ?
TAMARA: What ?
BEN: Is n't it obvious who sent it ? That tosser Andy Cobb .
TAMARA: He would n't do that .
BEN: Making himself all cosy in you house . Going through your stuff , prob'ly wearing your fucking pants -
TAMARA: No way !
BEN: Bet it was him that nicked my black T-shirt .
TAMARA: There is no way Andy would do that ! Ben pulls his jacket on .
BEN: Well that says it all ; the way you leap to his defence .
TAMARA: He has n't done anything .
BEN: You know what ? I know Fran fucked my best friend but at least she was straight with me .
TAMARA: Ben - where are you going ? Do n't go !
BEN: Fuck 's sake .
WITHOUT APOLOGY: I 'm taking the dog for a crap .
POPPY: Oh come on mum . She 's just stirring shit . Tamara 's always done that .
BETH: Why 's your father on there - and poor Andy ? It 's so tasteless .
POPPY: You know how subversive she is . She once sent me a valentine from Prince Harry - and I believed it . It 's her sense of humour ; she likes causing trouble . At school she used to give us first years tips on how to shoplift .
BETH: She taught you to shoplift ?
POPPY: Mum , she 's marrying Ben Sergeant . Why would she look at an old git like dad ?
NICHOLAS: What did you make of that email from Tamara ?
ANDY: It do n't make any sense . Her London oyfriend 's trying to fuck her up ; that 's my theory . Andy carries on working .
TO HIMSELF: Could n't agree more .
CASEY: How come she 's with a different bloke every week and when Lesley Hunt 's sister shagged Jeff Dobson - just once , after he lied he loved her - she gets called a dirty slag .
JODY: That 's cos she does it in five sta esorts around the world - and not The Feathers carpark .
CASEY: ` Who 's the daddy ? Steve Culley and Fran Redmond recently announced they were expecting . But in a Valentine tryst shocker Fran is snapped with ex Ben Sergeant ! Ben and Fran - we say Get A Room . '
JODY: He 's back with Fran ? After
CASEY: After that email , Jode .
JODY: No way . No way !
MUM: What 's all your fault ?
JODY: None of your business .
MUM: I 'm bloody sick of you looking like a wet weekend . Who 's Ben ?
JODY: No one .
MUM: What 've you done ?
JODY: Nothing .
MUM: Are you in trouble ?
JODY: NO ! Leave me alone .
MUM: You take care with boys , Jody . You know what can happen .
JODY: What can happen ? What can ever , ever happen in a place like this ?
LUCETTA: Are they crows or jackdaws ? It 's so nice to get these little details ight .
BETH: They 're rooks .
LUCETTA: I 've got an unhappy wife and a newly qualified vet discovering a forbidden world of physical love in a bird hide .
THROUGH BINOCULARS: There 's Nicholas
TAMARA: I 'm looking for Andy .
NICHOLAS: He 's not up at Stonefield . Tamara is about to turn back .
TAMARA: Oh fuck off .
NICHOLAS: I liked your email . Very succint .
TAMARA: Well I did n't send it . And I would n't shag you if you were the last man left after a nuclear winter .
NICHOLAS: I 'll come round tomorrow then . About three ?
TAMARA: Drop dead you smug prick . Nicholas watches her storm back up the copse .
ZOE: Still time to change your mind . Blue skies . Fun in the sun .
ANDY: Just not a traveller , Zoe .
GENTLY: I know you 're like a big old tree . Stuck here .
NICHOLAS: I 'll probably stay on at the library for another hour or two . Yes just checking some law reports .
TAMARA: So . Nicholas .
NICHOLAS: You can tell me to leave . Tamara says nothing .
TAMARA: No .
NICHOLAS: Do n't cry . Am I really that bad ? Tamara shakes her head , glad of him .
TAMARA: I 'm just not myself .
NICHOLAS: Yes you are . She looks up at him .
TAMARA: I used to watch you out of my window helping your daughter learn to skateboard up the lane . Bit of an obvious crush , was n't it .
NICHOLAS: Is that why you 're crying ?
TAMARA: No .
NICHOLAS: Am I here as revenge on your ex ?
TAMARA: I do n't know why you 're here . Why are you here , Nicholas ?
NICHOLAS: Because since you climbed ove that stile in the summer I have n't thought about very much else . She does n't believe him .
TAMARA: You can use me in one of your books .
NICHOLAS: When can we do this again ?
TAMARA: What about Beth ?
NICHOLAS: Look , Beth and I have this kind of
TAMARA: Bullshit .
NICHOLAS: Thursday ?
TAMARA: Is n't life complicated enough ? Nicholas shakes his head . He kisses her .
BETH: Oh poor you - was it awful ?
NICHOLAS: Bloody terrible . Did n't move till well past Chiswick . But look , I nipped into Fortnums He hands her a package .
BETH: All my favourite teas - Oh !
NICHOLAS: Maybe I will
LUCETTA: I 'm trying this magic realist bit at the end of chapter three , where the characters slowly turn into
NICHOLAS: That sounds very innovative
LUCETTA: Do you think so ? It 's sort of the key to the structure , which I 'm thinking of as a nest shape
GLEN: So after two years of radio silence I contact my editor . And she loves - I mean loves the chapters I did in the fall .
BETH: Oh Glen .
GLEN: I tried writing at the library but I could feel that awful paralysis descending again .
BETH: I 'm glad you 've come back .
GLEN: A few solid weeks should - holy cow !
BETH: The bastard -
GLEN: Meanwhile , Hardy falls in love with a woman who is thirty nine years younger than him .
BETH: I do n't believe it .
NICHOLAS: Geoff .
GLEN: Glen .
NICHOLAS: Henry James .
GLEN: Thomas Hardy .
NICHOLAS: That 's right , a Hardy book . Coming well ?
GLEN: Yes , actually . Nicholas returns to the paper .
BETH: He gave his wife syphilis .
NICHOLAS: Jolly good .
BETH: He 's completely distracted . He 's up and down to London all the time . The latest Inchcombe 's taking everything he 's got .
TAMARA: Is it any good ? Because I keep -
NICHOLAS: Shush . This is brutally candid . You lay yourself completely bare .
TAMARA: I 'm well-known for it .
NICHOLAS: Seriously . It 's very moving .
TAMARA: Thank you .
NICHOLAS: So have I done my duty ?
TAMARA: Admirably .
NICHOLAS: Now do I get my treat ? Tamara , almost in his arms , is crestfallen .
TAMARA: You are so cheesy .
JODY: Zero Ben sightings in two whole months .
CASEY: Last time I saw Plastic she looked like a minger ; all red-eyed and gutted . Ben 's a Love Rat .
JODY: She 's probably topped herself . I would if Ben dumped me .
CASEY: Jode . Do n't say that . What if she 's done something ?
JODY: Like got in the bath with her heated tongs ?
CASEY: Like taken a stack of pills ?
JODY: D'you think she might be lying there all choked in vomit and drug froth ?
CASEY: That 'd be dire .
JODY: If we find her we 'll get in the papers .
CASEY: Oh my God .
JODY: Rock Chick Dead at Winnards Farm .
CASEY: What 's Uncle Andy doing here ? Andy knocks .
NICHOLAS: Arse biscuits .
CASEY: No answer
JODY: She could have been lying there days . She could be like putrid now , like rancid -
CASEY: Oh no , I 'm gon na chuck -
JODY: Like bloated and all greeny .
CASEY: And Uncle Andy 'll find her by the smell !
BOTH: Eurrrrr ! Shhhhh ! !
TAMARA: Andy
JODY: Bollocks .
ANDY: Have n't seen you for a while . Thought you might be ill or something . O depressed or -
TAMARA: I 've had my head down , writing .
ANDY: Come for a drink . Let 's lighten up .
TAMARA: I 'd love to , but
ANDY: Shake off the winter blues . Come celebrate the spring .
TAMARA: I ca n't I 'm kind of on one with my writing .
COOLLY: Sure .
JODY: D'you think he 's in with a chance ?
CASEY: No way .
JODY: Why not ? He 's fit . I 'd do him .
CASEY: Jody - he 's my uncle .
JODY: She 'd be mad not to have him - I et he goes a like a train .
NICHOLAS: What 's he doing here ?
TAMARA: He just came on the off-chance .
NICHOLAS: Off-chance of what ?
TAMARA: He wants to know about roofing fo the shed
JODY: Let 's go . I 'm freezing my tits off .
CASEY: Wait ! !
JODY: Oh . My . God .
CASEY: It 's him . From Stonefield .
JODY: The dirty cheating sod .
BETH: You fucking little slut . She puts her head in her hands .
CASEY: ` Prolific author of intelligent crime novels . '

CASEY: Maybe she 's numbing the pain .
JODY: He 's not even a proper celeb .
CASEY: Maybe older guys know more you know , bed stuff .
JODY: Eww ! He 's a perv . I hate him .
CASEY: Jode , I know who I feel sorry for .

BETH: So it did . Well . Hope it does n't ain . She turns for home .
CASEY: Gutted for her .
JODY: Me too . Fat arse though , has n't she ?
CASEY: There 'll be the divorce and like acrimony and her world 'll fall apart
JODY: Yeah .
CASEY: But maybe one day , she 'll put the itterness behind her and find a new love
JODY: Do n't be daft . She 's old , you big sop . A parked 4x4 looms out of the mist .
CASEY: See ? That 's D-List 's car .
JODY: So this is where he hides it when he goes to shag Plastic .

JODY: You loser . I hate you . You want to
NICHOLAS: Cock pie . Has he told Beth ?
TAMARA: I do n't know . But he might . And I would n't blame him .
NICHOLAS: Well , I suppose it has to come out sometime .
TAMARA: Does it ?
NICHOLAS: It 's a good thing . Feels like a elief . Means you and I can start to think about our plans . For the future
TAMARA: Nicholas ?
NICHOLAS: I know it 's been hard , sharing me with Beth . But I 'm yours now . I 'm going to leave her . I want a new life - and I want it now . With you . Tamara is appalled . A minder interrupts .
MINDER: Mr Hardiment ? It 's time .
NICHOLAS: It all runs very smoothly . I start a ook in the summer , publish it the following spring . Bit of a factory , eally .
BETH: You write a lot about adultery . Is that from personal experience ?
NICHOLAS: Madam , what a saucy question !
BETH: Why do you cheat persistently on you wife ?
NICHOLAS: Because she lets me .
TAMARA: It 's got to stop , Nicholas .
NICHOLAS: You 're right . I ca n't go on using her , lying to her . Wo n't be fun but I 've got to do it .
NICHOLAS: I do n't feel alive with Beth ! I have n't been living for years . She 's had me smothered in a comfy blanket -

BETH: Good God , even when you try and tell the truth you lie . YOU LIE ! ! Nicholas is falling apart .
NICHOLAS: BethDo n't . You ca n't .
BETH: I will .
TO BOSS: And you - Go home ! Bugger Off ! !
TAMARA: Ben
BEN: Right . Now put two sugars in and stir it . OK. That 's a decent cup . Which is lucky Jody cos if it had een shit , I 'd be on the phone to the extremely scary local cops ight now .
JODY: Please do n't tell my mum .
BEN: I knew it was boring round here but for fuck 's sake
JODY: I 'm gon na get out as soon as I can . Going to work in Vegas - as a croupier . Vegas , or a cruise liner .
BEN: Aim high , that 's what I say .

NICHOLAS: Oy ! Greg ! I want a a word with you .
GLEN: It 's Glen , asshole .

ANDY: Tamara
TAMARA: I 'm sorry . She starts crying bitter tears .
ANDY: Tam , come on . It was an accident .
TAMARA: I do n't want to be with Ben .
JODY: Pap me ! Pap me !
ANDY: What are you doing ? Glen ca n't look him in the eye .
GLEN: I figured I 'd best , you know , take myself off . She does n't want writers around the place now . And police , autopsies , not my thing -
ANDY: You ca n't run away .
GLEN: I 'm not running away ! I just finished my book ; my time here is up . Destiny calls .
ANDY: Beth is asking for you .
GLEN: She 's Really ?

BETH: It was my fault . I let the dog go !
GLEN: No , no
BETH: I shooed him away ! The police said it was an accident but
GLEN: It was n't your fault !

GLEN: Beth . I have to tell you

BETSY: Tom .
TOM: The senator 's white paper is almost eady , Bets . Should we wait for that ?
BETSY: Andy usually just sends those to the national media . The local press does n't know what to do with a position paper until UPI and AP tell them anyway .
TOM: I think we should try to get maximum coverage for this new mandatory welfare program . Push the issues .
BETSY: First push the man , then the issue . Senator Palantine is first of all a dynamic man , an intelligent , interesting , fascinating man .
TOM: You forgot & quot ; sexy & quot ; .
BETSY: No , I did n't forget & quot ; sexy & quot ; .
TOM: Just did n't get around to it , huh ?
BETSY: Oh , Tom , please .
TOM: Well , for Christsakes , you sound like you 're selling I do n't know what cars not issues .
BETSY: Have you ever wondered why CBS News has the highest ratings ?
TOM: More people watch it .
BETSY: Alright , forget it if you 're not going to be serious ,
TOM: No , c'mon , I 'm listening . I was just
BETSY: Just what ?
TOM: Kidding around you know , fun .
BETSY: Maybe if you 'd try thinking once in a while , you 'd get somewhere .
TOM: With who ?
BETSY: Alright , now . You want to know why CBS has the highest ratings ? You their news is any different from NBC , ABC ? It 's all the same news . Same stories . Same order usually . What , you thought they had good news for people , right ? You thought that 's why people watched CBS ? I 'll tell you why people watch CBS . Cronkite . The man . You got it ? Not the news , not the issues , the man . If Walter Cronkite told people to eat soap , they 'd do it . We are selling cars , goddamn it .
TOM: Well , if Cronkite 's so great , why do n't we run him instead ?
BETSY: That 's the last . The finish . Period . Some pople can learn . Some people ca n't . And you wonder why we neve get serious
TOM: Sure we could run him . You realize he 's already of his block association .
BETSY: Have you been noticing anything strange ?
TOM: No , why ?
BETSY: Why 's that taxi driver across the street been staring at us ?
TOM: What taxi driver ?
BETSY: That taxi driver . The one that 's een sitting here .
TOM: How long has he been there ?
BETSY: I do n't know - but it feels like a long time .
TOM: Well , I 'll go out and ask him .
WIZARD: First she did her make-up . You know , I hate it when they do that . I mean she does the whole works , the mascara , the eye-shadow , the lipstick , the rouge
TRAVIS: Hey Wizard .
WIZARD: Ask Travis . He 's the ladies man .
TRAVIS: Some fleet driver for Bell just cut up . Just heard it on the radio .
WIZARD: Sure . What do you think ? She wanted to get out of the cab . I said & quot ; Look , you 're in the middle of the fucking bridge & quot ;
WIZARD: We call him Dough-Boy cause he likes the dollars . He 'll chase a uck straight into Jersey .
TRAVIS: Some fleet driver for Bell just got cut up . Just heard it on the radio .
WIZARD: Fuckin ' Mau Mau land , that 's what it is . Travis turns back to his companions .
TRAVIS: Huh ?
WIZARD: The cops and company raise hell they find out .
BETSY: Try holding the match like this .
TOM: This is got ta be a game , right ?
BETSY: This I got ta see .
TOM: Ouch !
BETSY: Oh , are you all right ?
TOM: I 'm great . Always set my fingers on fire . If you want to see anothe trick . I do this thing with my nose .
BETSY: No . I just wanted to see if you could light it that way . The guy at the newsstand can .
TOM: Ah , yes , the guy at the newsstand , Mr. Asbestos
BETSY: He happens to be missing fingers . I first noticed when -
TOM: Is he Italian ?
BETSY: No , why ?
TOM: You sure he 's not Italian ?
BETSY: He 's Black , OK ?
TOM: Well , If he had been Italian , they could have been shot off . Sometimes the mob does that to teach guys a lesson , If they blow a job o something .
BETSY: As I said , he is n't Italian . Besides , I thought they just killed them .
TOM: Do n't be naive . They ca n't kill everybody . They have different punishments for different things . Like , if they kill a stool pidgeon , they leave a canary on the body . It 's symbolic .
BETSY: Why do n't they leave a pidgeon instead of a canary ?
TOM: I do n't know . Maybe they do n't leave a canary . Do n't be technical . What I 'm saying is if this newsstand guy 's Italian and his fingers are gone , maybe he 's a thief .
BETSY: First , he 's not Italian . Second he 's not a thief . I noticed the fingers when he was getting my change - the right change . Two of his fingers are missing . Just stubs . Like they were blown away . I was putting my change in my purse when I saw him get out a cigarette . I could n't help watching . I was dying to see how he 'd light it .
TOM: With the other hand , right ?
BETSY: No , stupid . With the stubs . That 's the whole point .
TOM: I know that guy . His hand looks like a paw . An old Black guy , the newsstand at -
BETSY: No , this is young - well , I 'm neve sure how old Black people are - ut , anyway , he is n't old . That 's for sure .
TOM: Show me how he did that again .
TRAVIS: I want to volunteer .
TOM: If you 'll come this way . Travis elbows Tom off .
TRAVIS: No . I want to volunteer to you .
TOM: Bets .
BETSY: And why is that ?
TRAVIS: Because you are the most beautiful woman I have ever seen .
BETSY: Is that so ? But what do you think of Charles Palantine ?
TRAVIS: Who mam ?
BETSY: Charles Palantine . The man you want to volunteer to help elect president .
TRAVIS: Oh , I think he 's a wonderful man . Make a great , great President .
BETSY: You want to canvass ?
TRAVIS: Yes , mam .
BETSY: How do you feel about Senato Palantine 's stand on welfare ?
TRAVIS: Welfare , mam ? I think the Senator 's ight . People should work for a living . I do . I like to work . Every day . Get those old coots off welfare and make 'em work for a change .
BETSY: Well , that 's not exactly what the Senator has proposed . You might not want to canvass , but there is plenty more other work we need done Office work , filing , poste hanging .
TRAVIS: I 'm a good worker , Betsy mam , a eal good worker .
BETSY: if you talk to Tom , he 'll assign you to something .
TRAVIS: If you do n't mind , mam , I 'd rathe work for you .
BETSY: Well , we 're all working tonight .
TRAVIS: Well , Betsy mam , I drive a taxi at night .
BETSY: Well , then , what is it you exactly want to do ?
TRAVIS: If you do n't mind , mam , I 'd be mighty pleased if you 'd go out and have some coffee and pie with me .
BETSY: Why ?
TRAVIS: Well , Betsy mam , I drive by this place here in my taxi many times a day . And I watch you sitting here at this big long desk with these telephones , and I say to myself , that 's a lonely girl . She needs a friend . And I 'm gon na be her friend .
BETSY: I do n't know
TRAVIS: It 's just to the corner , mam . In oad daytime . Nothing can happen . I 'll be there to protect you .
BETSY: All right . All right . I 'm taking a break at four o'clock . If you 're here then we 'll go to the corner and have some coffee and pie .
TRAVIS: Oh , I appreciate that , Betsy mam . I 'll be here at four o'clock exactly . And ah Betsy
BETSY: Yes ?
TRAVIS: My name is Travis .
BETSY: Thank you , Travis . Travis nods , turns and exits .
TRAVIS: I know what you mean . I 've got the same problems . I just ca n't get things organized . Little things , I mean . Like my room , my possessions . I should get one of those signs that says , & quot ; One of these days I 'm Gon na Organezizied & quot ; .
BETSY: Travis , I never ever met anybody like you before .
TRAVIS: I can believe that .
BETSY: Where do you live ?
TRAVIS: Oh , uptown . You know . Some joint . It ai n't much .
BETSY: So why did you decide to drive a taxi at night ?
TRAVIS: I had a regular job for a while , days . You know , doin ' this , doin ' that . But I did n't have anything to do at night . I got kinda lonely , you know , just wandering around . So I decided to works nights . It ai n't good to be alone , you know .
BETSY: After this job , I 'm looking forward to being alone for a while .
TRAVIS: Yeah , well In a cab you get to meet people . You meet lotsa people . It 's good for you .
BETSY: What kind of people ?
TRAVIS: Just people people , you know . Just people . Had a dead man once .
BETSY: Really ?
TRAVIS: He 'd been shot . I did n't know that . He just crawled into the back seat , said & quot ; West 45th Street & quot ; and conked out .
BETSY: What did you do ?
TRAVIS: I shot the meter off , for one thing . I knew I was n't goimg to get paid . Then I dropped him off at the cop shop . They took him .
BETSY: That 's really something .
TRAVIS: Oh , you see lots of freaky stuff in a cab . Especially when the moon 's out .
BETSY: The moon ?
TRAVIS: The full moon . One night I had three or four weirdoes in a row and I looked up and , sure enough , there it was - the full moon . Betsy laughs . Travis continues
BETSY: Com'on , Travis . It 's not that bad . I take lots of taxis .
TRAVIS: I know . I could have picked you up .
BETSY: Huh ?
TRAVIS: Late one night . About three . At the plaza .
BETSY: Three in the morning ? I do n't think so . I have to go to bed early . I work days . It must have been somebody else .
TRAVIS: No . It was you . You had some manila folders and a pink bag from Saks .
BETSY: You 're right ! Now I remember ! It was after the Western regional planners were in town and the meeting went late . The next day I was completely bushed . It was unbelievable .
TRAVIS: If it was n't for a drunk I would have picked you up . He wanted to go to the DMZ .
BETSY: The DMZ ?
TRAVIS: South Bronx . The worst . I tried to ditch him , but he was already in the cab , so I had to take him . That 's the law . Otherwise I would have picked you up .
BETSY: That would have been quite a coincidence .
TRAVIS: You 'd be surprised how often you see the same people , get the same fare . People have patterns . They do more or less the same things every day . I can tell .
BETSY: Well , I do n't go to the Plaza every night .
TRAVIS: I did n't mean you . But just ordinary people . A guy I know - Dough-Boy - met his wife that way . They got to talking . She said she usually caught the bus so he started picking her up at the bus stop , taking her home with the flag up .
BETSY: That 's very romantic . Some of you fares must be interesting . See any stars , politicians , deliver any abies yet ?
TRAVIS: Well , no not really had some famous people in the cab . I got this guy who makes lasers . Not regular lasers , not the big kind . Little lasers , pocket sized , small enough to clip your belt like a transistor radio , like a gun , you know . Like a ray gun . Zap .
BETSY: What hours do you work ?
TRAVIS: I work a single , which means there 's no replacement - no second man on the cab . Six to six , sometimes eight . Seventy-two hours a week .
BETSY: You mean you work seventy-two hours a week .
TRAVIS: Sometimes 76 or 80 . Sometimes I squeeze a few more hours in the morning . Eighty miles a day , a hundred miles a night .
BETSY: You must be rich .
TRAVIS: it keeps ya busy .
BETSY: You know what you remind me of ?
TRAVIS: What ?
BETSY: That song by Kris Kristofferson , where it 's said & quot ; Like a pusher , party truth , partly ficition , a walking contradiction & quot ; .
TRAVIS: I 'm no pusher , Betsy . Honest . I never have pushed .
BETSY: The singer ?
TRAVIS: Yeah . Yes . I do n't follow music too much .
BETSY: Kris Kristofferson .
MAN'S VOICE: St. Regis Hotel .
TOM: It 's 12 30 now . You 'll have fifteen minutes before the actual luncheon egins .
ASSISTANT: I do n't think we have to worry about anybody here committing themselves until things start coming in from California .
TRAVIS: Say , are n't you Charles Palantine , the candidate ?
PALANTINE: Yes I am .
TRAVIS: Well , I 'm one of your biggest supporters . I tell everybody that comes in this cab that they should vote for you .
PALANTINE: Why , thank you Travis .
TRAVIS: I 'm sure you 'll win , sir . Everybody I know is going to vote for you . I was going to put one of you stickers on my taxi but the company said it was against their policy .
PALANTINE: I 'll tell you , Travis , I 've learned more about this country sitting in taxi cabs than in the board room of General Motors .
TOM: And in some other places too
PALANTINE: Travis , what single thing would you want the next President of this country to do most ?
TRAVIS: I do n't know , sir . I do n't follow political issues much .
PALANTINE: There must be something
TRAVIS: Well , he should clean up this city here . It 's full of filth and scum . Scum and filth . It 's like an open sewer . I can hardly take it .
MORE: & # 12 ;
PALANTINE: I know what you mean , Travis , and it 's not going to be easy . We 're going to have to make some radical changes .
TRAVIS: Damn straight .
PALANTINE: Nice talking to you , Travis .
TRAVIS: Thank you , sir . You 're a good man , sir . Travis ' taxi departs .
BETSY: You did n't have to spend you money - ?
TRAVIS: He 'll , what else can I do with it all ?
BETSY: Travis , you have n't even played the ecord ?
TRAVIS: Yeah , well my stereo player is oke . But I 'm sure the record is OK .
BETSY: Your stereo broke ? God , I could hardly stand that . I live on music .
TRAVIS: I do n't follow music much . I 'd like to though . Honest .
BETSY: So you have n't heard this record yet ?
TRAVIS: No . I thought maybe you could play it for me on your player .
BETSY: What are you doing ?
TRAVIS: I bought a couple of tickets .

TRAVIS: You got a .44 Magnum ?
ANDY: That 's an expensive gun .

MORE: & # 12 ;
TRAVIS: I want a .32 . Revolver . And a palm gun . That .22 there .
ANDY: That 's the Colt .25 - a fine little gun . Do n't do a lot of damage , but it 's as fast as the Devil . Handy little gun , you can carry it almost anywhere . I 'll throw it in fo another $ 125 .
TRAVIS: How much for everything .
ANDY: The .32 's $ 150 - and you 're really getting a good deal now - and all together it comes to , ah , seven eighty-five for four pieces and a holster . He 'll , I 'll give you the holster , we 'll make it seventy-five and you 've got a deal - a good one .
TRAVIS: How much to get a permit to carry ?
ANDY: Well , you 're talking big money now . I 'd say at least five grand , maybe more , and it would take a while to check it out . The way things are going now $ 5.000 is probably low . You see , I try not to fool with the small-time crap . Too risky , too little bread . Say 6 G 's , but if I get the permit it 'll be as solid as the Empire State Building .
TRAVIS: Nah , this 'll be fine .
ANDY: You ca n't carry in a cab even with a permit - so why bother ?
TRAVIS: Is there a firing range around ?
ANDY: Sure , here , take this card , go to this place and give 'em the card . They 'll charge you , but there wo n't e any hassle .

TRAVIS: They 'd never get me to go back . They 'd have to shoot me first . You got anything to carry these in ?
ANDY: Sure .
TRAVIS: Huh ?
ANDY: I can get you front and center . What do you like ? I can get you Mets , Knicks , Rangers ? Hell , I can get you the Mayor 's box .

TRAVIS: I 'm sorry , Iris . I did n't mean that .
IRIS: You 're not much with girls , are you ?
TRAVIS: Well , Iris , I look at it this way . A lot of girls come into my cab , some of them very beautiful . And I figure all day long men have been after them trying to touch them , talk to them , ask them out . And they hate it . So I figure the best I can do for them is not bothe them at all . So I do n't say a thing . I pretend I 'm not even there . I figure they 'll understand that and appreciate me for it .
IRIS: Do you really think I should go to the commune ?
TRAVIS: I think you should go home , but otherwise I think you should go . It would be great for you . You have to get away from here . The city 's a sewer , you got ta get out of it .

SARAH: Yes . Do n't hurt me .
REESE: I 'm here to help you . Reese , Sergeant/Tech-Com , DN38416
COP: I do n't know , it looks like it might spread to this furniture warehouse across the alley , the paint on the wall 's starting to bliste up
SARAH: This is a mistake . I have n't done anything .
REESE: No . But you will . It 's very important that you live .
SARAH: I ca n't believe this is happen- ing . How could than man get up after you
REESE: Not a man . A Terminator . Cyber Dynamics Model 101 .
TERMINATOR: This is One-Four-Three . West- ound on Olympic , approaching Overland .
SARAH: A machine ? You mean , like a robot ?
REESE: Not a robot . Cyborg . Cybernetic Organism .
SARAH: Buthe was bleeding .
REESE: Just a second . Keep you head down .
SARAH: Look , Reese , I know you want to help , but
REESE: Pay attention . The 600 series had rubber skin . We spotted them easy . But these are new . They look human . Sweat , bad breath , everything . Very hard to spot . I had to wait 'til he moved on you before I could zero him .
SARAH: Hey , I 'm not stupid , y'know . They ca n't build anything like that yet .
REESE: No . Not yet . Not for about forty years .
SARAH: So , it 's from the future , is that right ?
REESE: One possible future . Four you point of view . I do n't know the tech stuff .
SARAH: And you 're from the future too ?
REESE: Right . They come to a red light and Reese stops .
SARAH: Right
REESE: Cyborgs do n't feel pain . I do . Don'tdo thatagain . He wipes his hand on his pants .
SARAH: Just let me go .
REESE: Listen . Understand . That Terminator is out there . It ca n't be reasoned with , it ca n't e bargained withit does n't feel pity of remorse or fear and it absolutely will not stop . Ever . Until you are dead . Sarah slump in utter resignation .
SARAH: Can you stop it ? Reese does n't look at her .
REESE: Maybe . With these weapons I do n't know .
SARAH: Reesewhy me ? Why does it want me ?
REESE: There 's so much
SARAH: Tell me . Just start at the eginning . Reese musters his thoughts . And starts .
REESE: There was a war . A few years from now . Nuclear war . The whole thing . All this
SARAH: I do n't understand
REESE: Defense network computer . New . Powerful . Hooked into everything . Trusted to run it all . They say it got smarta new order of intelli- gence . Then it saw all people as a threat , not just the ones on the other side . Decided out fate in a microsecondextermination .
SARAH: The what ?
REESE: Hunter Killers . Patrol machines . Build in automated factories . Most of us were rounded up , put in campsfor orderly disposal .
SARAH: Reese !
VUKOVICH: Here , drink some of this
SARAH: Lieutenant , are you sure it 's them ? Maybe I should see the bodies .
VUKOVICH: They 've already been identi- fied . There 's no doubt .
SARAH: Of , GodGingerkiddo , I 'm so sorry .
VUKOVICH: Sarah . Sarah , this is Dr. Silber- man . I 'd like you to tell him everything Reese said to you . Do you feel up to it ?
SARAH: I guess so . You 're a doctor ?
SILBERMAN: A criminal psychologist .
SARAH: Is Reese crazy ?
SILBERMAN: That 's what we 're going to find out .
REESE: With the One Thirty Second under Perry , from '21 to '27
SILBERMAN: The year 2027 ?
REESE: That 's right .
TRAXLER: This is fucking great .
REESE: Then I was assigned Recon Security , last two years , under John Connor .
SILBERMAN: And who was the enemy ?
REESE: SKYNET . A computer defense system uilt for SAC-NORAD by Cybe Dynamics . A modified Series
SILBERMAN: I see . And thiscomputer , thinks it can win by killing the mother of its enemy , kill- ing him , in effect , before he is even conceived ? A sort of etroactive abortion ?
REESE: Yes .
TRAXLER: That Silberman just crack me up . He had this guy in here last week who set his Afghan on fire . Screwed it first , then set it on
VUKOVICH: Shut up .
REESE: it had no choice . The defensive grid was smashed . We 'd taken the mainframes We 'd won . Taking out Connor then would make no difference . Skynet had to wipe out his entire exist- ence . We captured the la complex . Found thewhat- ever it was calledthe time-displacement equipment . The Terminator had already gone through . They sent two of us to intercept , then zeroed the whole place . Sumner did n't make it .
SILBERMAN: Then how are you supposed to get back ?
REESE: Ca n't . Nobody goes home . Nobody else comes through . It 's just him and me .
SILBERMAN: Why did n't you bring any weapons ? Something more advanced . Do n't you have ay guns ?
REESE: You go naked . Something about the field generated by a living organism . Nothing dead will go .
SILBERMAN: Why ?
REESE: I did n't build the fucking thing .
SILBERMAN: Okay . Okay . But this cyborgif it 's metal
REESE: Surrounded by living tissue .
SILBERMAN: Of course . The real Silberman put the tape on `` PAUSE '' .
REESE: Most official records were lost in the war . The compute knew almost nothing about Connor 's mother . Her name . Where she lived , just the city . No scanner pictures . The Terminator was just being systematic . C.U . - REESE , ON SCREEN , as he goes on .
SILBERMAN: I 'm afraid that 's not up to me .
REESE: Then why am I talking to you ? Get out .
SILBERMAN: I can help you
REESE: Who is in authority here ?
SILBERMAN: Sorry . C.U . - SARAH staring at the empty screen .
SARAH: So Reese is crazy .
SILBERMAN: In technical terminology , he 's a loon .
SARAH: But
VUKOVICH: Sarah , this is body armor . Out TAC guys wear it . It 'll stop a 12 gauge round . This other individual must 've had one under his coat .
SARAH: But what about him punching through the windshield ?
TRAXLER: Probably on PCP , broke every one in his hand and wo n't feel it for hours . There was this guy once that
VUKOVICH: Why do n't you just stretch out here and get some sleep . It 'll take your mom a good hour to get here from Redlands .
SARAH: I ca n't sleep .
VUKOVICH: Go ahead . You 're safe . There 're thirty cops in this building .
SARAH: Okay .
TRAXLER: What ? Ed , come onthe guy 's a wacko . Vukovich glances up .
VUKOVICH: He 'd better be .
TERMINATOR: I 'm a friend of Sarah Connor . I was told she is here . Can I see her , please ?
SERGEANT: You ca n't see here . She 's making a statement .
TERMINATOR: Where is she ?
SERGEANT: Look . It 's gon na be a while . You wan na wait . There 's a ench .
TERMINATOR: I 'll come back .
VUKOVICH: Stay here . He turns the locking knob and slams the door . Leaving her alone . She flinches as more SHOTS SOUND . CLOSER .
TRAXLER: Watch him . The door closes .
VUKOVICH: You just keep her alive . Do what you have to .
REESE: Let 's get off the road .
SARAH: Freezing .
REESE: Come here .
SARAH: Reeseyou got a first name ?
REESE: Kyle .
SARAH: Kyle , what 's it like when you go through time ?
REESE: White light . Pain . Like eing ripped inside out slowly . Like being born , maybe .
SARAH: You 're wet . Oh my god .
REESE: I caught one , back there .
SARAH: Caught one ? You mean you got shot ? Reese shrugs .
REESE: It 's not bad . Sarah sits up and turns toward him .
SARAH: We got ta get you to a doctor .
REESE: It 's okay . Forget it .
SARAH: Forget it ? Are you crazy ? Let me see it .
REESE: See . Missed everything . Passed through the meat . Sarah starts swabbing the flesh wound .
SARAH: This is gon na make me puke . Talk about something .
REESE: What ?
SARAH: Just talk . Tell me about my son . Is he tall ?
REESE: About my height . He has your damnhe has you eyes .
SARAH: What 's he like ?
REESE: You trust him . He 's got that strength . You 'd die in a second for John .
SARAH: Well , at least I know what to name him . I do n't suppose you 'd know who the father is ? So I do n't tell him to get lost when I meet him .
REESE: John never said much about him . He dies . Even before the war
SARAH: Stop ! I do n't want to know . Hold still . Soit was John that ordered you here ?
REESE: I volunteered .
SARAH: You volunteered ?
REESE: It was an honor . A chance to meet the legend . Sarah Connor . Who taught her son to fightorganize , prepare . From when he was a kid . When you were in hiding , before the war .
SARAH: You talk about things I have n't done yet in the past tense . It 's making me crazy . I ca n't think . Are you sure you 've got the ight person ? Reese appraises her coldly .
REESE: I 'm sure .
SARAH: Come on , me ? The mothe of the future ? Am I tough ? Organized ? I ca n't even balance my checkbook . I cry when I see a cat that 's been run over and I do n't even like cats . She pulls the bandage tight with a knot .
REESE: Ow ! No , it 's okay . It 's etter tight .
SARAH: And anyway , what do I know about guerrilla warfare ?
REESE: You 'll learn .
SARAH: Look , Reese , I did n't ask fo this honor and I do n't want it . Any of it .
REESE: John gave me a message fo you . Made me memorize it . 'Sarah '' this is the message 'Sarah , thank you . For you courage through the dark years . I ca n't help you with what you must soon face , except to tell you that the future is not set there is no such thing as Fate , ut what we make for ourselves y our own will . You must be stronger than you imagine you can be . You must survive , or I will never exist . ' That 's all .
SARAH: You like it ? It 's my first .
REESE: Sleep . It 'll be light soon .
SARAH: Okay . Talk some more .
REESE: About what ?
SARAH: About where you 're from .
REESE: Alright . You stay down by day , but at night you can move around . The H-K 's use infra-red so you still have to watch out . But they 're not too bright . John taught us ways to dust them them . That 's when the infiltra- tors started to appear . The Terminators were the newest , the worst
SENTRY: Terminator !
SARAH: I was dreaming about dogs .
REESE: We used them to spot Terminators . Sarah groans as she straightens her legs .
SARAH: Your worldit 's pretty terrifying .
DRIVER: and when it breaks right off the point they get some pretty rad tubes up there . Not awesome , but I mean , worth the drive , if you 're hardcore like me .
REESE: Rad tubes ?
SARAH: He 's a surfer .
DRIVER: You from back East of something ?
SARAH: No , he 's from the future .
DRIVER: Whoah . I hear that . Listen , I had a rough night . I got ta stop and ag some Z 's .

KYLE: Dunno . Been together since we was little . Bunch of us kids was at the day-care center when the bombs fell she and me are the only ones still around .
MARCUS: So this is it ? Your life ?
KYLE: We 're gon na find the Resistance , fight for John Connor against Skynet . You oughta join us , you 're pretty cool .
MARCUS: You do n't know me .
KYLE: You 're strong , you can read you did n't kill us . Good enough for me
MARCUS: Skynet runs the machines ? So who 's this John Connor ?
KYLE: He 's I do n't know . The best . Everybody talks about him . He 's the one who 's gon na save us .
MARCUS: Yeah , right . Him and Jesus .
KYLE: Who 's Jesus ?
MARCUS: You 're asking the wrong guy .
KYLE: So why were you in prison ?
MARCUS: I killed a cop .
KYLE: Were cops like terminators ?
MARCUS: Well Nah , some of ` em were all right .
SIGHS: My little brother Max , pretty wild kid , not much older than you he stole a car , just joy-riding , y'know , showing off .
BEAT: Max must be dead too , now like everybody else .
KYLE: You gon na be here when I wake up ?
MARCUS: Sure .
KYLE: Good . Stay away from the windows .
STAR: Just me .
MARCUS: The bible . My grandma always tried to get me into it , but it always put me to sleep .
BEAT: Still does .
STAR: Would you read something to me ?
MARCUS: `` of the tribe of Simeon , Shaphat the son of Hori . Of the tribe of Judah , Caleb the son Jephunneh ''
STAR: There 's a book inside with pictures .
MARCUS: `` Guaranteed lowest prices open seven days ''
STAR: What 's that ?
MARCUS: It 's a flower . A rose .
STAR: So all those numbers you could call them and get , like , flowers , or someone to come ove and fix stuff , or bring you food
MARCUS: Guess people had it pretty good .
FLIPS: What else we got movers , mufflers , music
STAR: Music ?
MARCUS: You know , pianos , guitars
STAR: I do n't remember music .
MARCUS: Come on . You must `` I ca n't get no satisfaction '' `` We are family I got all my sisters with me '' No , huh . How about `` Twinkle twinkle little star ''
STAR: Somebody used to sing that to me .
KYLE: If we get it to move , will you teach me to make it go ?
MARCUS: It 's called driving . Sure .
STAR: Wow . What were these like ?
MARCUS: Not too many around in my time .
STAR: Now !
MARCUS: Pop the clutch ! Let your foot up !
KYLE: Aerostat 's coming !
STAR: Music
MARCUS: Sort of .
STAR: Oh no ! It 's gon na call a Harvester , we 're dead
KYLE: Wow . You 're good .
STAR: Faster !
MARCUS: No ! You 're doing fine .
RADIO VOICE: proper ratio of ammonium nitrate to diesel fuel . A bomb of this type can be contained in an ordinary plastic garbage bag , and will detonate on impact
KYLE: That 's him !
RADIO VOICE: This recording has described booby- traps and explosive devices . It will repeat every two hours on different frequencies to avoid Skynet jamming
MARCUS: Stop the car .
RADIO VOICE: Do not give in to despair . As leak as things seem , I assure you , humanity will triumph .
KYLE: We oughta find a place to hole up for the day
MARCUS: Damn it . Empty .
KYLE: You smell that ?
STAR: Food !
MARCUS: What is this ?
KYLE: Who cares ?
MARCUS: Spit it out !
STAR: It 's good !
COW: Not much meat on ` em .
PIG: This one 's fi-i-ine
MARCUS: Oops .
PIG: We did n't kill ` em ! I swear to God , they was dead already , we was n't gon na let ` em rot
BULL: Go ` head , take as much as you want , we 're on the same side here
MARCUS: Name 's Marcus .
BLAIR: You can put me down now , Marcus .
MARCUS: I 'm heading that way .
BLAIR: The hot zone ? No you 're not .
MARCUS: I 've got to get to my friends
BLAIR: What friends ?
MARCUS: Couple of kids . They were in that flying dumpster
BLAIR: The Skynet transport ? It was carrying people ? Christ , we almost shot it down . There 've been rumors about a concentration camp , but
MARCUS: Hydrobots ?
BLAIR: They ca n't see , but they have kille sonar . They 'll attack anything that moves or makes a sound . Even if you get past them , you 'd be dead before you covered a hundred yards . If the terminators do n't get you , the fallout will heavy rads all the way to the Gulf coast , nothing can live there .
MARCUS: You 're with the Resistance .
BLAIR: Lt. Blair Williams , I fly for what used to be the Air National Guard .
MARCUS: I do n't know this has got ta be some kind of , like , dream o hallucination . Like what happens to people right before they die
BLAIR: That snap you out of it ?
MARCUS: Let 's hear it .
BLAIR: Whatever they pumped into your veins just knocked you out . This Angel Project you signed up for there was a lotta cryogenic stuff going on before the bombs fell , they musta froze your ass .
MARCUS: What the hell for ?
BLAIR: Drug tests , medical experiments , organ harvesting , who knows ? You said you had no family , no friends why let a ody like yours go to waste ?
MARCUS: I 've never seen trees like these .
BLAIR: We 're in a mutation zone . I saw a two-headed squirrel here once
MARCUS: Freaky .
BLAIR: Tasted like chicken .
MARCUS: What was that ?
BLAIR: I did n't hear anything
MARCUS: They 're surrounding us .
BLAIR: They 're smart . And they do n't scare easy .
MARCUS: Dog eat dog world .
BLAIR: Thanks .
MARCUS: Staf ? What 's that mean ?
BLAIR: It 's a resistance term . Sit tight and fuck .
MARCUS: I 'm not gay . In prison , I thought about puss women all the time . But now it 's not working . Who knows , all those years on ice
BLAIR: Maybe it 's just gon na take some time . Before you 're completely thawed out .
MARCUS: I dunno . They just sorta eminded me of her .
BLAIR: Who ?
MARCUS: There 's a woman , the last woman I saw before when I was under , the dead time she kept coming to me . I think she must 've saved me .
BLAIR: I ca n't compete with that .
KYLE: We 've landed .
STAR: What 's going to happen to us ?
KYLE: I do n't know
MARCUS: We 're in somebody 's garden .
BLAIR: Christ there 's supposed to be arbed wire along the edge .
MARCUS: Over there .
BLAIR: Whatever you do , do n't move .
SHOUTS: Yo ! Morrison , Barnes ! Can anybody hear me ? ! We 're in the middle of the mine field .
BARNES: Somebody feed those things !
MORRISON: Start up the generator , Barnes .
LISA: We got company !
BARNES: Blair ? Good to see you . What 's the password ?
BLAIR: Eat shit and die , Barnes !
BARNES: Close enough . Who 's your friend ?
BLAIR: Could you get us outta here please ?
BARNES: Kinda dumb-ass , wandering around in a mine field .
BLAIR: You did n't maintain the perimeter ! Where are your sentries ?
BARNES: It 's too early for that military crap .
BLAIR: You goddamn idiot !
BARNES: He was takin ' bigger steps !
MORRISON: Son of a bitch is heavy .
JANE: He stepped on a Claymore ? This guy oughta be in a hundred pieces
BLAIR: What are you doing ?
JANE: Does he have a prosthetic limb ?
BLAIR: I do n't think so .
JANE: This is not skin oh Jesus oh God
SERENA: Why is n't he conscious ? Something 's wrong , he should be coming out of it by now
MARCUS: Boo !
JANE: Thermoplastic skin , some large hydraulics , but mostly titanium microgears This looks like some sort of aeration and hydration system , function unclear at this point . Valves and what looks like an access panel elow the ribcage
BLAIR: Whatever he is he 's on our side
MORRISON: How can he be ?
BLAIR: He saved my life !
MORRISON: Winning your trust would aid his infiltration .
LISA: Regional does n't know what to do . They 're gon na patch us through to Command Los Angeles .
NANCY: How could you bring this monster here ? ! This is our home ! Our children
BLAIR: What do you want from me I did n't know !
KID: It 's awake !
MARCUS: Get me the hell down from here !
BARNES: Shut up ! I told you to shut up !
BLAIR: Leave him alone ! Marcus , I 'm so sorry
BARNES: It keeps talkin ' at me . God this thing gives me the creeps .
MARCUS: Why are you doing this ? What is this place ?
MORRISON: We 're trying to
NANCY: Do n't say anything ! It 's probably uplinked to Skynet .
MORRISON: Then it 's already too late . This used to be an ICBM silo , we 're just trying to stay alive here . Your turn where 'd you come from ?
MARCUS: Corpus Christi . It 's in Texas . O it was .
BARNES: It sounds completely human it eally could pass .
JANE: Did n't John Connor say they 'd start uilding things like this ?
MORRISON: Not yet not for years . So , you 're programmed with false memories , a human history
MARCUS: What are you talking about ?
MORRISON: You can skip the act , we know what you are .
NANCY: Why are you even speaking to it ? !
BARNES: She 's right , let 's just waste the damn thing
NANCY: It 'll kill us all if we give it a
MARCUS: I 'm a man !
LISA: Regional got through to CLA they want us to rig a video feed . He wants to see him .
MORRISON: Who does ?
LISA: John Connor .
MARCUS: So this guy is what , like king of the world , or what 's left of it ?
MORRISON: John Connor founded the Resistance . When the war began , no one even knew who the enemy was Conno taught us how to fight back . He saved humanity .
MARCUS: Yeah , well , humanity 's never done all that much for me . Why ca n't I see him ?
MORRISON: Nobody sees him . Skynet ca n't be allowed to discover his location , even his appearance is kept secret .
CONNOR'S VOICE: hello standing by
LISA: Sir , we can hear you , sir , working on a visual , sir
CONNOR: Not what I expected
CONNOR'S VOICE: It does seem lifelike is the face able to mimic emotions ?
MARCUS: This shit is ridiculous . What the hell do you want from me ?
CONNOR: I I need to know what you are .
MARCUS: So do I ! I do n't know what I am , what I 'm doing here , I do n't know shit maybe I never did , but I 'm sick of it ! Just blow my head off or let me go .
CONNOR: This is n't right . I ca n't be having a conversation with a terminator , Skynet is n't that sophisticated yet . Unless were you sent here from the future ?
MARCUS: What ?
CONNOR: Skynet 's developing a time displacement field , we 've decrypted ecent data transmissions .
SADLY: I know for a fact that soon machines will be travelling back decades . To try and stop us from winning this wa efore it begins
MARCUS: You 're out of your mind , are n't you ?
CONNOR'S VOICE: Jesus I 've seen enough . Stand y for further instructions .
KATE: He 's not a cyborg no blood , no human tissue over the endoskeleton .
CONNOR: Besides , the first T-800s wo n't be manufactured until ` 26 .
ADVISOR #1: Maybe he 's a one-off , an experiment .
ADVISOR #2: Let 's hope . If there are more out there like him , we 're in serious trouble . Christ , a terminator with attitude
KATE: Where did they find him ?
ADVISOR #1: East-central Texas , near an area of heavy Skynet concentration . The outpost where they 're holding him is easonably secure , but it 's not much more than a commune .
CONNOR: I want him extracted .
ADVISOR #1: Done . What then ?
CONNOR: Get him to our best people fo disassembly , find out what makes him tick . We need to get into that metal skull , crack his CPU at all costs .
KATE: Because people trust you you give them faith
CONNOR: No . Because I knew I would be , I was told . I know when and where the major battles are going to take place . I know I 'm going to send my own father back through time to save my mother even though I have n't met him yet . Christ , I even know the year I 'm going to die
KATE: JOHN
CONNOR: So how could I not know about this ? !
MARCUS: Feels like I been here before what are you gon na do to me ?
MORRISON: Nothing . Los Angeles is sending a chopper seems you 're some kind of VIP .
KYLE: We 're stopping .
STAR: I 'm scared .
KYLE: Whatever happens , we stick together .
MARCUS: Hello ? Anyone there ?
BEAT: I 'm thirsty .
BARNES: Want some motor oil ?
MARCUS: I need water .
BARNES: Bullshit . Machines do n't drink .
MARCUS: Please , I 'm
BARNES: Shut up , robot !
BLAIR: How 's it going , Barnes ? Thought you might like a late-night snack .
BARNES: Where in hell 'd you get these ?
BLAIR: We got a stash back at the base .
BARNES: Kinda stale .
BLAIR: You need something to wash it down .
BARNES: I 'm on duty , you know .
BLAIR: You know I always liked you , Barnes . I just did n't want to join the harem .
BARNES: What can I say ? It 's our duty to epopulate the planet .
BLAIR: Noble of you to make the sacrifice .
BARNES: C'mere .
BLAIR: I prefer a little privacy .
BARNES: You 're so twentieth century
BLAIR: Men . You 're all talk .
MARCUS: Why are you doing this ?
BLAIR: I do n't believe you 're a terminator .
MARCUS: So what am I ?
BLAIR: Whatever you are I owe you one . Once you 're free , I 'll lie down next to Barnes they 'll assume you escaped while we were passed out
MARCUS: You think they 'll buy that ?
BLAIR: Worth a shot . Marcus , Command wants to take you apart , cut open your head . One thing I know , you 're alive and you 've got a right to live .
MARCUS: I 'm heading across the river .
BLAIR: No human being can survive there
MARCUS: I 'm not human , remember ?
BLAIR: You 're gon na try and save those kids .
MARCUS: It 's the only thing I can think of that makes any sense
BLAIR: Marcus , for all you know , they 're dead already
MARCUS: For all I know , they 're the reason I 'm back from the dead .
BLAIR: Damn it , we 're too late
MARCUS: Where 's that go ?
BLAIR: Should lead out , but there 's no way past the fan
MARCUS: Thank you .
MARCUS: Do n't mention it .
CONNOR: I need to talk to the prisoner .
BLAIR: Sir .
CONNOR: At ease . Please , sit .
BEAT: Why in God 's name would you help a terminator escape ?
BLAIR: Sir he is n't a terminator . He 's human .
CONNOR: We know he 's crossed into Skynet territory , why would he do that if he is n't
BLAIR: He 's trying to find his friends .
CONNOR: What friends ?
BLAIR: A couple of kids . They were taken in a Skynet transport , probably to some kind of prison camp he said their names were Star and Kyle .
CONNOR: Kyle .
BLAIR: Mm Kyle something . With an ` R . '
CONNOR: Reese .
BLAIR: That 's it . How did you ?
KATE: What is it , John ?
CONNOR: I always knew I 'd have to find him someday . I just did n't know how .
KATE: What ? Find who ?
CONNOR: My father .
STAR: Oh no , oh no
KYLE: Shh , keep singing .
STAR: Up above the world so high , like a diamond in the sky
KYLE: Stop it stop it STOP IT !
JEREMY: Are you all right ?
MARCUS: What the hell is this ?
JEREMY: You look like you 've been hit by a truck
MARCUS: Among other things . Look , I 'm trying to find some friends a couple of kids . They were taken here , I saw some buildings
JEREMY: The facility , sure . Hop in , I 'll take you there .
MARCUS: Marcus .
JEREMY: I ca n't connect with you at all your interface must 've been damaged . Do n't worry , soon they 'll have you as good as new .
MARCUS: I did n't think there was anything like this left anywhere .
JEREMY: Yes . We 're very lucky . Want some ?
MARCUS: This is n't food .
JEREMY: Well , of course not . Seems you got a little memory loss going on .
BEAT: Our brains are powered by fuel cells , emember ?
MARCUS: Terminators !
JEREMY: We do n't call them that here .
MARCUS: What are you ?
JEREMY: A hybrid . The same as you .
MARCUS: A hybrid human and machine ?
JEREMY: Of course . That 's what this community is for people like us .
MARCUS: Jesus why ?
JEREMY: You should be grateful to have been chosen .
MARCUS: What about the ones who were n't ?
JEREMY: You mean like Janet and the kids .
MARCUS: Your family . You lost them ?
JEREMY: ` Cause I feel good . The interface ecognizes negative emotions rage , grief , despair and stimulates positive endorphins in response . Thank God , life would be pretty unbearable otherwise , do n't you think ?
MARCUS: Tell me everything . How did you people get here ?
JEREMY: Most of us worked at NASA or DARPA . I was an engineer on Project Angel
MARCUS: Angel what is it ?
JEREMY: Advanced Nexus of Genetic and Electronic Life-forms A-N-G-E-L. You can stop choking me , it 's not like I need to breathe .
MARCUS: English !
JEREMY: The goal was a superior support system for the human brain to go anywhere , do anything explore deep space , the bottom of the sea . I specialized in optics .
ENGINEER: 32578 - acceptable . 32579 - no , insufficient neural capacity . 32580 - eh , this one should n't have even been brought here
SERENA: Marcus !
MARCUS: It 's a graveyard .
SERENA: There was no choice the old civilization had to be eliminated . To make way for a new world a world without death or suffering .
AIDE: Sir , I 'm sorry to disturb you , but you said you wanted to know immediately
CONNOR: What is it ?
AIDE: We found our terminator .
NAVAL OFFICER: There ca n't be any prisoners there . The whole area 's a nuclea wasteland only machines can survive the radiation levels fo any length of time .
CONNOR: Mobilize a combined air and naval assault , all available resources . We 're sending in a rescue team ASAP .
KATE: All to find one teenage boy ? John , you really think this can work ?
CONNOR: I 'm standing here , I exist so it must have worked . We will find him .
SERENA: Calm down , Marcus . It 's all right .
MARCUS: Like fuck it is . I 'm sick of being your guinea pig , what are you doing to me now ? !
SERENA: Repairing you .
MARCUS: You all work for Skynet !
SERENA: Please . Skynet works for us . It 's only a program a tool , a means to an end .
MARCUS: The end of the world .
SERENA: Its sole purpose is to protect humanity .
MARCUS: Into this ? A brain in a box ?
SERENA: Skynet had access to the entire defense web including Project Angel . It determined hybrids were the only path to salvation .
MARCUS: Destroying the human race in orde to save it .
SERENA: When the resistance attacked ou installation , we were forced to self-destruct . We would have taken you with us , but we thought you were in a permanent coma
MARCUS: No , stop I do n't want it ! You 're dead inside , all of you !
SERENA: We 're immortal . No sane person would choose to live in pain , forever . Soon you 'll understand .
SERENA: How are you feeling , Marcus ?
MARCUS: I 'm not sure I know how to describe it .
SERENA: It 's called happiness . You 've been angry all your life . You do n't know what it 's like to feel a part of something .
SERENA: Pure ecstasy we can share in it together .
MARCUS: When I was a kid my grandmothe would go on about heaven it always sounded so boring .
SERENA: Were you bored just now ?
SERENA: Nanotechnology , polymimetic metals working with Skynet , we 're making amazing breakthroughs , well beyond anything possible before Judgment Day .
MARCUS: A time machine Connor was right .
SERENA: The Resistance leader ? You know him ?
MARCUS: I 've just heard him speak .
SERENA: He 's a dangerous man . Delusional . He thinks he 's a savior , but all he 's eally fighting for is death .
MARCUS: In the world outside the survivors think Skynet is the enemy , out to destroy them . Why do n't you tell them about all this ?
SERENA: Not everyone can become like us , Marcus . We just do n't have the esources to sustain more than a few thousand hybrids .
MARCUS: Then why Some people I knew were picked up , taken here
SERENA: A boy and a girl in the last day or two ?
MARCUS: Yes what is this place ?
SERENA: Part of the neural net human minds linked directly with artificial intelligence . The processing powe of the human brain is still beyond anything Skynet can manufacture .
MARCUS: That 's them .
SERENA: Good news . He 'll soon be part of the network you 'll be able to connect with him .
MARCUS: Of course . I I understand .
SERENA: I do n't know I have to go . Will you be all right ? Of course you will .
MARCUS: I need to go back !
PHYSICIST: The wormholing fluctuates , right now it 's oscillating between three and six hours
MARCUS: What do I do ?
PHYSICIST: Just breach the sphere . But you could materialize anywhere in a mile radius
ENGINEER: 32581 looks good 32582 hm , orderline . May not be emotionally compatible . Pass .
MARCUS: Let them go .
ENGINEER: What ? Who are you ?
MARCUS: I said , let them go !
ENGINEER: You ca n't hurt me .
MARCUS: Now you 're pissing me off .
KYLE: No !
STAR: What ?
KYLE: Marcus !
STAR: I knew you 'd come .
MARCUS: We 've got ta get out of here .
KYLE: Watch me !
STAR: That looked like
MARCUS: I know . Long story .
STAR: Why do n't you drive ?
KYLE: Come on I was doing good !
KYLE: Where are we going ?
MARCUS: There .
KYLE: He 's not real .
STAR: Do n't come any closer !
MARCUS: I 'm sorry .
MARCUS: There are more prisoners , a complex about a mile in
KYLE: Kyle Reese .
CONNOR: John Connor . I 'm glad you made it .
MARCUS: Yeah , well . Get in line .
DOCTOR: Does this hurt ?
MARCUS: I do n't feel a thing . Help somebody else .
KATE: Your dad he seems like a nice kid .
CONNOR: The last boatload is right behind me . Skynet 's pouring in einforcements , we ca n't hold this place . And the people in the houses , they wo n't leave
MARCUS: They 're not people anymore
SERENA: Why , Marcus ? You were immortal
MARCUS: No one lives forever .
CONNOR: This this ca n't happen
BLAIR: Marcus I need to head back to my unit .
MARCUS: I have no idea . I should be dead
STAR: But you 're alive .
MARCUS: So to speak .
BLAIR: We 've been ordered not to talk about it the hybrids , everything about that place is top secret
MARCUS: Yeah , simpler to keep it man versus machine .
STAR: What did it feel like ? To be one of them ?
MARCUS: Better than anything . Everything made sense . For the first time in my life , I felt right . It was heaven .
BLAIR: How could you give that up ?
MARCUS: I never really believed in heaven .
BLAIR: Here . You need these more than I do .
KATE: He wants to see you .
CONNOR: Her name was Sarah she was amazing
KYLE: I do n't remember my mother .
CONNOR: Keep it .
KATE: Kyle , could you give us a minute ?
MARCUS: You 're asking me to become Him ?
CONNOR: You must .
KATE: We ca n't keep him alive much longer . Very few people know what John actually looks like . Only the technicians and our closest advisors need ever know the truth .
MARCUS: Why me ?
KATE: Who else ? Only you know the enemy from the inside . You liberated a Skynet camp you 're a hero .
CONNOR: I never knew how I was supposed to win this war . But I finally understand the idea of John Conno is more important than the person . I can die . He can not .
KATE: Please . We need you .
CANNED; TINNY: If you need help , dial nine one one . If you need help , dial nine one one .
POLICEMAN: Rachel ? Rachel , are you okay ?
RACHEL: Momma !
POLICEMAN: Honey , she just has to go somewhere , to get some rest , so she 'll feel etter .

BOYD: Daytime , yes ; nighttime , no . We 've een over this ground . I only brought him in this morning . No juice ?
EMILYN: We 're out of a lot of things .
TO RACHEL: I heard dog noises last night . When I was trying to sleep .
LOUDER: Walter was not in the house last night .
BOYD: You watch that voice in this house . While you 're here , you 'll respect he as your mother , and treat her as such .
RACHEL: Sorry . She picks through her cold cereal in silence .
EMILYN: Your mom 's making progress is n't she , on the new medicacions , the tricyclics ?
RACHEL: Yes , ma'am .
BEAT: May I be excused ?
RACHEL: Yes , sir .
SMILES: Well , hullo .
RACHEL: She speaks . She opens her mouth and sounds come out . The sounds are words . LTA gives her a Cheshire cat grin .
LISA: What 's wrong , fcscer-dad bein ' a pain again ?
RACHEL: Why are you so weiz.ly happy ?
LISA: o I look any different ?
RACHEL: Do you look any
GETTING IT: Oh , my gawd . You did it .
LISA: Yep . With who ?
RACHEL: C'mon . ' 1 Fess up .
LISA: All will be revealed in due time .
RACHEL: You suck .
LISA: I love you too .
ARNIE: Hi there gruesome twosome , how 'bout a threesome ?
LISA: Lunch . Meet me in the parking lot .
CHUCK: Hey , Mark , the girl over there , how many if I do her ?
MIFFED: Hold it . I did her last week , I only got five .
MARK: She was having a bad hairday .
I JESSE: Yeah , whatever .
CHUCK: What 's the matter with you , she 's got an ass stamped `` Made in Heaven
JESSE: I do n't know , you ever have a conversation with her ? It 's like talking down a well . She only wants me cause I 'm on the football team .
MARK: So what ? You want her to want you cause of your dazzling personality ? Look , you want someone to talk to , you got us . H , you screw .
ASIDE: Woof- Coyote date .
JESSE: That 's harsh , man , keep it down .
ERIC: What 's a coyote date ?
MARK: When you wake up in the morning , and she 's sleeping on your arm , and the only way to get up is to wake her . So you gnaw your arm off instead . BRAD snorts a laugh .
ENGLISH TEACHER: Hello Montagues , hello Capulets .
AS ASSIGN: A few tentative hands , including JESSE .
ENGLISH TEACHER: I thank you for your honesty , but I am saddened . I 'd like to think we 're here to study William Shakespeare , not worship at the altar of Leo DiCaprio . Scattered laughs .
BEAT: Why is it that we are so moved by love stories that end with separation ? The STUDENT ' s faces are blank .
ENGLISH TEACHER: What are some other stories with this theme ?
NO RESPONSES: How about , Dr. Zhivago ? Casablanca ? Still blank . AMY timidly raises her hand .
AMY: You meair like in Dumb and when the girl 's husband showed up ? The TEACHER surrenders to the inevitable .
ENGLISH TEACHER: Okay , well . Perhaps at some level we know that Lauren Holly 's husband AIM to show up ? What say ? Anyone ?
BEAT: Rachel ? I do n't know that I believe in it .
ENGLISH TEACHER: Believe in what ?
RACHEL: Love . JESSE looks at her , pensive .
SYMPATHETIC: Well , then you 've got bigger problems than passing this crass .
ARNIE: Love is fifteen seconds of squishing noises . Unquote . Johnny Rotten .
TRACY: Who would love her ?
ENGLISH TEACHER: Do you think that all love stories are tragedies ? I mean , unless they die at the same time , all lovers are eventually separated by death .
JESSE: Well , then Romeo and Juliet is n't a tragedy , because the only way they could really be together was in death .
ENGLISH TEACHER: Very good . A foul cynic , most cliche . A true romantic , how refreshing .

LOUISE: I do n't know , Thelma ! I do n't know ! Just shut up a minute so I can think . Thelma starts to cry quietly .
THELMA: Should n't we go to the cops ? I mean , I think we should tell the police .
LOUISE: Tell them what ? ! What , Thelma ? What do you think we should tell them ?
THELMA: I do n't know . Just tell 'em what happened .

THELMA: Louise Are you alright ? Louise rests her head on the steering wheel .
LOUISE: Oh Christ . Thelma . Thelma does n't hear .
THELMA: Yes .
LOUISE: It means you do n't talk to anybody . You do n't draw attention to yourself in any way . Do you understand that ? Again , she twitches more than nods .
THELMA: Our next move ? I 'll say one thing , Louise . This is some vacation . I sure am having a good time . This is eal fun .
LOUISE: If you were n't so concerned with having a good time , we would n't be here right now .

LOUISE: Just shut up .
THELMA: I have to go to the bathroom . I Sorry . HOLD on Louise .
HAL: Could you identify 'em , if ya saw 'em again ?
LENA: If waitin ' tables in a bar do n't make you an expert on human nature , then nothin ' will , and I could 've told you that Harlan Puckett would end up buyin ' it in a parkin ' lot . I 'm just surprised it did n't happen efore now .
HAL: Who do you think did it ?
LENA: Has anybody asked his wife ? She 's the one I hope did it .
HAL: Lena , just cut the bullshit , will ya ? Do have any ideas or do n't ya ? I been standin ' in this stupid parkin ' lot all goddamn night , and I still got to go file a report before I can go home in time to get back up again !
LENA: Well , if I had to guess , I 'd say it was some ol ' gal , some ol ' gal 's husband . But it was n't either one of those two . The tall one , the edhead , she left me a huge tip .
HAL: You did n't happen to notice what kind of car they were driving ?
LENA: It 's a nightclub , not a drive-in , Hal . I do n't follow the customers to the parking lot .
HAL: Alright , Lena . Go on home . We might have to call you in for some more questioning . Lena gets out of the back of the car .
LENA: Those girls are not the murderous type .
THELMA: Collect from Thelma . There is no answer .
THELMA: Thanks . I 'll try later .
LOUISE: Thelma Come on , Thelma !
THELMA: What ? Oh , I do n't know . Let me look .
LOUISE: Hmmm . We got ta get some money .
THELMA: Why are you unpacking ? You said we were just gon na take a nap . Louise did not realize she was doing it .
LOUISE: Oh , I do n't know . I 'm just nervous . I got ta figure out what to do .
THELMA: Well , when you figure it out , wake me up .
LOUISE: Just what the hell is wrong with you ? Louise slams the closet door . Thelma jumps .
THELMA: What do you mean ?
LOUISE: Why are you actin ' like this ?
THELMA: Actin ' like what ? ! How am I supposed to act ? 'Scuse me for not knowing what to do after you blow somebody 's head off ! They are silent for a moment .
LOUISE: You could help me try and figure it out ! I got ta figure out what to do , and you could try and help me .
THELMA: I suggested we go to the police , but you did n't like that ; so , frankly , Louise , I 'm all out of ideas .
LOUISE: Well , what 's the big rush , Thelma ? If we just give 'em some time , they 'll come to us ! Oh Christ . I 'm just not ready to go to jail yet . Why do n't you go out to the pool o something and I 'll figure it out
THELMA: Give me the keys .
LOUISE: You 're not touchin ' that car .
THELMA: My stuff 's in the trunk ! God ! You care more about that car than you do about most people .
LOUISE: Most people just cause me trouble , ut that car always gets me out of it .
HAL: What 's that ?
I.D. TECH: Blood ?
HAL: Whose ?
I.D. TECH: His , I guess
HAL: You guess ?
LOUISE: Hi . I 'm okay . How are you ? Long time no see .
JIMMY: Yes , yes , darlin ' . I can help you . Tell me where you are .
LOUISE: I have a savings account with about sixty-seven hundred dollars in it . Now I know you wo n't be able to get it out , but I 'm good for it . I need that money . Can you wire me the sixty-seven hundred dollars and I 'll pay you back ? Please , I 'm desperate .
JIMMY: You 're in Oklahoma ? !
LOUISE: Tell me now .
THELMA: Did you finish thinking ?
LOUISE: I think better when I drive . Louise PEELS OUT of the parking lot .
HAL: All we know is there were two women in a green T-Bird convertible that turned left out of the parking lot , going real fast . We 're trying to get a make on the car , but nothin ' yet . So far , we got nothin ' .
MAJOR: Well , you 'd best get something . Even if they did n't do it , it times out that they most likely witnessed it . I want somebody to at least talk to 'em . Put out an APB with a description and see what we get back .
HAL: Alright .
MAJOR: Is there any reason to believe they 've left the state ?
HAL: That 's certainly possible .
MAJOR: Why do n't we go ahead and let the ureau in on this .
HAL: I have no problem with that .
MAJOR: Somebody 's butt is gon na bar-b-que .
THELMA: Do n't get mad , Louise , but where are we going ?
LOUISE: Oklahoma City . Jimmy 's gon na wire me some money , and then
THELMA: You talked to him ? ! Is he mad ? Did you tell him ?
LOUISE: No , I did n't tell him . And that 's something we got ta get straight . Darryl 's been callin ' , mad as a hornet , makin ' all kinds of noise . When you talk to him , you can not say anything about this . You got ta make sure everything sounds normal .
THELMA: I called the asshole at 4 00 in the morning and he was n't even home . I do n't know what he 's got to be mad about . I 'm the one who should be mad .
LOUISE: I 've been tellin ' you that for the last ten years .
THELMA: Do you think Darryl 's having an affair ?
LOUISE: I do n't think Darryl is mature enough to conduct an affair .
THELMA: But you think he fools around .
LOUISE: Thelma , I 'm going to Mexico . I think I can make it in two and a half days , ut I 'm going to have to haul ass . Are you up to this ? I mean , I have to know . This is n't a game . I 'm in deep shit . I got ta know what you 're gon na do .
THELMA: I I do n't know . I do n't know what you 're askin ' me .
LOUISE: Do n't you fall apart on me . Goddamnit , Thelma . Every time we get in trouble , you go blank or plead insanity or some such shit , and this time Not this time . Everything 's changed now Now you can do whateve you want , but I 'm going to Mexico . I 'm going . Are you coming with me ?
THELMA: I think he does . Fool around .
LOUISE: Do you have a pay phone ?
OLD MAN: 'Round the side , by the restrooms .
JIMMY: Louise !
LOUISE: Is that how you answer the phone ?
JIMMY: Louise ?
OLD MAN: Ma'am , are you sure you would n't ather have the large economy size ?
LOUISE: Go call Darryl .
THELMA: Call him ?
LOUISE: Call him . Do n't tell him anything . Tell him you 're having a wonderful time and you 'll be home tomorrow night .
THELMA: Will I be ?
LOUISE: I do n't know . I wo n't be .

THELMA: Darryl .
HITCHHIKER: Whoa ! Excuse me ! Miss , are you alright ?
THELMA: No . Thanks . Sorry .
HITCHHIKER: Would you mind me asking which direction you and your friend are going ? I 'm trying to get back to school and my ride fell through , so I 'm kinda stuck . Are you going my way ? Thelma does n't know what to do .
THELMA: Umm . I think we 're going to Oklahoma City . But I 'm not sure .
HITCHHIKER: Do you think you could I mean , I could help pay for gas . Thelma knows Louise is n't going to like this .
THELMA: Ummm . Well , see , it 's not really up to me . It 's not my car . Umm , we 'll have to ask my friend , but she 'll probably say no . She 's a little uptight .
HITCHHIKER: Well . Maybe we better not ask her . But thank you anyway .
THELMA: Well , we can ask her . That wo n't hurt .
LOUISE: It 's probably not a good idea .
THELMA: Louise .
HITCHHIKER: Y'all have a nice day . Drive safe .
THELMA: See how polite he is ? He was really nice .
HITCHHIKER: You cheer up now !
THELMA: I wish we could 've brought him with us .

LOUISE: I 'm sorry . I 'm just not in the mood for company right now . Here . Take this map . I need you to find all the secondary roads to Mexico from Oklahoma City . I think we should stay off the interstates . We 're too conspicuous .
THELMA: Well , it looks like we can get on this road 81 that heads down towards Dallas , then cut over to
LOUISE: I do n't want to go that way . Find a way that we do n't have to go through Texas .
THELMA: Wait . What ? You want to go to Mexico from Oklahoma and you do n't want to go through Texas ?
LOUISE: You know how I feel about Texas We 're not going that way .
THELMA: I know , Louise , but we 're running for our lives ! Do n't you think you could make an exception just this once ? ! I mean , look at the map . The only thing between Oklahoma and Mexico is Texas !
LOUISE: Thelma ! I 'm not gon na talk about this ! Now find another way or give me the goddamn map and I will ! You understand ?
THELMA: No , Louise . How come you never said what happened ?
LOUISE: I I just I just do n't think it 's the place I wan na get caught for doin ' something like if you low a guy 's head off with his pants down , believe me , Texas is the last place you wan na get caught ! Trust me ! Now , I said , I do n't wan na talk about it ! !
THELMA: Okay . We 'll go around Texas to get to Mexico . This is crazy .
THELMA: So J.D. , what are you studying in school ?
LOUISE: And whaddya wan na be when ya grow up ?
DARRYL: What ? !
THELMA: Darryl , that 's my husband , he says he 's not ready . He 's still too much of a kid himself . He prides himself on being infantile .
LOUISE: He 's got a lot to be proud of .
THELMA: Louise and Darryl do n't get along .
LOUISE: That 's puttin ' it mildly .
THELMA: She thinks he 's a pig .
LOUISE: He 's a real piece o ' work . I wish you could meet him .
THELMA: Twenty-four is n't young . I 'd already een goin ' out with him ten years when we got married . I 've neve een with anybody but Darryl .
LOUISE: We 'll take you on to Oklahoma City , then you 'd best be on your way .
HAL: The prints on the trunk of the ca match those of Thelma Dickinson .
MAX: Well I 'll be damned . Is n't that strange .
HAL: And the husband says a gun is missing . She took a lot of stuff . It looks like she maybe planned on being gone a while . The strange thing is , he husband said she would never touch that gun . He got it for her 'cause he 's out late a lot , but he said she 'd never touch it , would n't learn to shoot it , just left it in a drawe for years .
MAX: What kind of gun was it ?
HAL: We 're lookin ' . They were on thei way to some guy 's cabin and they never showed up . We 're lookin ' . We hope you 're lookin ' too .
LOUISE: I just got ta run in for a minute .
WOMAN: Nothin ' . Nothin ' came in today at all .
LOUISE: Nothing under peaches ? Check again under peaches .
WOMAN: Naw , nothin ' under peaches neither .
JIMMY: Hey , peaches .
LOUISE: Oh my God ! Jimmy ! You Oh my God ! What are you doin ' here ?
JIMMY: Can we get another room ? Just put it on my credit card . The Woman hands them a key .
WOMAN: 'Round to the back .
THELMA: Jimmy ! Hello , stranger . What in the world are you doin ' here ?
JIMMY: Ask me no questions , I 'll tell you no lies .
THELMA: Good answer . Same goes double fo me .
JIMMY: Who 's your friend ?
THELMA: This is J.D . He 's a student . We 're just givin ' him a ride to to here . Louise said we could bring him here and then he 'd have to go . And that 's what he 's doin ' . He 's goin ' . Are n't you , J.D . ?
LOUISE: Thelma kinda took to him . Jimmy is smiling .
JIMMY: Well , come on , gal , I got you a room . You can go on in and take a nice cold shower .
THELMA: Do n't mind me , Jimmy , I 'm just a wild woman .
JIMMY: I always knew that .
THELMA: A regular outlaw .

JIMMY: Okay , honey . I do n't want to rush you . I just wan na talk to you and be alone with you . I 'll just be in my room , 115 , you just come on down when you 're ready .
THELMA: I do n't care what you say about him . The boy has got it bad .
LOUISE: He 's always got it bad as long as I 'm running in the other direction . Do n't be fooled , he 's no different than any other guy . He knows how to chase and that 's it . Once he 's caught you , he do n't know what to do . So he runs away .
THELMA: I heard that .
LOUISE: Our future .
THELMA: So what are you gon na tell him ?
LOUISE: Nothing . I 'm not gon na tell him a thing . The least I can do is not make him an accessory any more than he already is .
THELMA: You are so sweet to that guy , you eally are . Imagine not wanting to drag him into this . He is a lucky man .
LOUISE: I did n't ask him to come ! It 's like I said , Thelma , he just loves the chase .
THELMA: Well boy , he 's got his work cut out for him now , do n't he ?
LOUISE: Put a lid on it , Thelma ! It 's hard enough as it is . Just let me get this part over with . Now stay here and guard the money . If there 's any problem I 'm in room 115 .
THELMA: I wo n't wait up . Louise turns to face Thelma .
LOUISE: How do I look ?
THELMA: You 're a vision , Louise , a goddamn vision of loveliness , you always are .
LOUISE: Have another drink , Thelma . Louise walks out the door .
THELMA: Good idea .
LOUISE: Hello
JIMMY: Who is it ?
LOUISE: It 's me .
THELMA: Louise ? Another KNOCK .
JIMMY: Now , my little coconut , what seems to be the trouble here ? Tell Daddy everything .
LOUISE: Jimmy , my daddy 's still alive and it kind of gives me the creeps when you do that
JIMMY: Okay , okay , just tell me what 's the trouble . Louise just looks at him for a minute .
LOUISE: Jimmy , I 'm not gon na tell ya what the trouble is . Someday soon you 'll understand why I ca n't . But I wo n't tell ya , so do n't ask me .
JIMMY: Okay , peaches , okay . But can I ask you one thing ?
LOUISE: Maybe .
JIMMY: Does it have something to do with another guy ? Are you in love with him ?
LOUISE: It 's nothin ' like that .
JIMMY: Then what ? ! What , goddamnit , Louise ! Where the fuck are you going ? Are you just leaving for fucking ever ? What , did you fuckin ' murder somebody or what ? ! Louise spills her champagne .
LOUISE: Stop it ! Stop it , Jimmy , or I 'll leave right now . I 'm not kiddin ' !
JIMMY: Alright , alright . I 'm sorry .
LOUISE: Maybe .
JIMMY: Will you wear this ?

THELMA: You wan na drink ?
JIMMY: So whaddya think . I mean I could uh get a job . Of some kind . I mean you 've been tellin ' me that for years , right ?
LOUISE: Why now , Jimmy ?
JIMMY: 'Cause , Louise . I do n't want to lose you . And for some reason I get the feelin ' you 're about to split . Permanently .
LOUISE: Jimmy , we 've gone all these years we never made it work . We 're not gon na be able to just I 'm not What kind of job , honey ? Can you see it . I ca n't .
JIMMY: I 'm the one I never made it work . I just It 's not that I do n't love you . It 's not that . I just neve thought I 'd be thirty-six years old and I never thought I do n't know what I thought . What do you want , darlin ' . What do you want me to do .
LOUISE: I do n't know . It does n't even matte anymore . I just want you to be happy It 's not that I do n't love you either . But Jimmy , your timing could n't be worse .
JIMMY: Are you just doin ' this to punish me ?
LOUISE: Believe me , the last thing I want is for you to get punished .
JIMMY: It does look good .
THELMA: Stop , stop , stop ! Thelma tries to catch her breath .
JIMMY: Louise ? I think you are so damn eautiful . I mean that . I always have . She smiles . Completely .
LOUISE: I think you 're beautiful too .
JIMMY: Do n't worry darlin ' . I 'll say I never found you . I 'll say anything you want . We 'll find a way to get you out of this , whatever it is .
LOUISE: Damn , Jimmy , did you take a pill that makes you say all the right stuff ?
JIMMY: I 'm choking on it . They sit for a minute .
LOUISE: Oh now it 's probably not such a good idea right now . I 'll catch up with you later , on down the road .
JIMMY: You keep this !
LOUISE: Your taxi 's here .
JIMMY: Are you happy , Louise ? I just want you to be happy . Louise looks at her hand and Jimmy 's hand .
LOUISE: I 'm happy , sweetie . Happy as I can e .
WAITRESS: Good thing he left when he did . We thought we were gon na have to put out a fire .
HAL: Honey ?
SARAH: Yes , baby ?
HAL: Do you think you could ever shoot someone ?
SARAH: What ?
HAL: Do you think you could ever think of a set of circumstances that would just cause you to haul off and shoot someone ?
SARAH: I could shoot your cousin Eddie .
HAL: Why ?
SARAH: Because he 's an inconsiderate asshole .
HAL: I 'm asking you seriously , Sarah , a stranger ?
SARAH: I do n't know , honey . I guess it would depend .
HAL: On what ?
SARAH: Well , maybe if they were trying to hurt you or one of the kids . I 'm sure I could shoot someone if they tried to hurt one of the children .
HAL: Yeah , I could too . But I do n't know why I 'm even asking you this . It 's just we ca n't place anybody at the scene but these two gals that everybody swears is sweet as pie . I do n't know . I keep hearing words impossible inconceivable . If just one person would say
SARAH: Honey . Nothing 's impossible . You just do n't shoot someone like that for no reason . Maybe he was askin ' for it . Anyway , somebody 's husband probably got ol ' Harlan .
HAL: That 's what everybody says . Only problem is nobody 's husband was unaccounted for that night Could you shoot Eddie in the face ? At point blank range ?
SARAH: In the leg .
HAL: I got ta go to Little Rock .
THELMA: Hi . She is shocked by Thelma 's appearance .
LOUISE: What happened to your hair ?
THELMA: Nothing . It got messed up .
LOUISE: What 's wrong with you ?
THELMA: Nothing . Why ? Do I seem different ?
LOUISE: Yes , now that you mention it . You seem crazy . Like you 're on drugs .
THELMA: Well , I 'm not on drugs . But I might e crazy .
LOUISE: I do n't think I wan na hear what you 're gon na tell me .
THELMA: Oh my God , Louise ! ! ! I ca n't believe it ! I just really ca n't believe it ! I mean whoa !
LOUISE: Oh , Thelma . Oh , no .
THELMA: I mean I finally understand what all the fuss is about . This is just a whole 'nother ball game !
LOUISE: Thelma , please get a hold of yourself . You 're making a spectacle .
THELMA: You know , Louise , you 're supposed to e my best friend . You could at least be a little bit happy for me . You could at least pretend to be slightly happy that for once in my life I have a sexual experience that is n't completely disgusting .
LOUISE: I 'm sorry . I am happy . I 'm very happy for you . I 'm glad you had a good time . It 's about time . Where is he now ?
THELMA: Taking a shower .
LOUISE: You left that guy alone in the room ?
THELMA: Ummm it 's on the table . It 's okay .
LOUISE: It 's not okay , Thelma . It 's definitely not okay . None of this is okay . What are we going to do for money ? What are we gon na buy gas with ? Our good looks ? I mean Goddamn , Thelma !
THELMA: Come on . Stand up ! Do n't you worry about it . I 'll take care of it . Just do n't you worry about it . Get your stuff . Louise is still sitting on the sidewalk .
HAL: As you know , we 've tapped your phone . In the event that she calls in .
MAX: We 're going to leave someone here at the house in the event that she calls in . Someone will be here until we find them .
HAL: The important thing is not to let on that you know anything . We want to try and find out where they are . Now I do n't want to get too personal , ut do you have a good relationship with your wife ? Are you close with her ?
DARRYL: Yeah , I guess . I mean , I 'm about as close as I can be with a nut case like that .
MAX: Well , if she calls , just be gentle . Like you 're happy to hear from her . You know , like you really miss her . Women love that shit .
LOUISE: Eighty-eight dollars ai n't gon na make a dent , baby girl .
THELMA: Do n't worry about it . You want anything ?
LOUISE: No .
THELMA: Drive ! Louise looks at her .
LOUISE: What happened ?
THELMA: Well ! We needed the money ! It 's not like I killed anybody , for God 's sake .
LOUISE: Oh shit , Thelma ! ! Shit ! Shit ! Shit !
THELMA: Now you get a grip , Louise ! Just drive us to Goddamn Mexico , will ya !
LOUISE: Okay . Shit , Thelma ! What 'd you do ? I mean , what did you say ?
THELMA: Well , I just
LOUISE: Holy shit .
DARRYL: Jesus Christ .
MAX: Good God .
HAL: My Lord .
LOUISE: Holy shit .
THELMA: Lem me see the map .
LOUISE: For the first time in my life , I wish this car was n't green .
THELMA: Are you sure we should be driving like this ? In broad daylight and everything ?
LOUISE: No we should n't , but I want to put some distance between us and the scene of our last Goddamn crime !
THELMA: Oooooweee ! ! You shoulda seen me ! Like I 'd been doin ' it all my life ! Nobody would ever believe it .
LOUISE: You think you 've found your calling ?
THELMA: Maybe . Maybe . The call of the wild !
LOUISE: You 're disturbed .
THELMA: Yes ! I believe I am !
JIMMY: I swear to God , she would n't tell me one thing ! Christ ! You oughta try to find that kid that was with 'em .
HAL: Tell us about him .
JIMMY: Just some young guy . Around twenty years old . Dark hair .
MAX: Do you understand that you may be facing an accessory charge ?
HAL: This is serious , son . A man is dead .
JIMMY: I know ! I 'd tell you if I knew ! Goddamn ! I know something happened , or she would n't have left . I 'm trying to remember everything ! Find that fucking kid . He probably knows something .
LOUISE: So what 's the plan , Thelma ? You just gon na stay drunk ?
THELMA: Try to .
LOUISE: Litterbug .
THELMA: Is n't that nice ? Truck drivers are always so nice . The best drivers on the road .
LOUISE: They think we like it . Maybe they think it turns us on . Louise shivers with disgust .
HAL: Is this the guy you saw them with ?
JIMMY: It 's him .
MAX: Oh , happy day .
JIMMY: You got ta be kiddin ' me . They picked up a murderer ? !
HAL: Armed robber .
JIMMY: Oh , great .
MAX: They 're flying him here right now . He was picked up this morning fo parole violation . They also found about six grand on him , so he probably knocked over something while he was out there . They can drop him by here for questioning . I 'm so happy .
JIMMY: How much cash did he have ?
LOUISE: Thelma .
THELMA: Yeah .
LOUISE: I want you to call Darryl .
THELMA: What for ?
LOUISE: To find out if he knows anything . If you think he does , you got ta hang up because it means the police have told him and the phone is probably tapped .
THELMA: Jeez , Louise , tapped the phone ? You think so ?
LOUISE: Oh , come on ! Murder one and armed obbery , Thelma !
THELMA: Murder one ! God , Louise , ca n't we even say it was self-defense ?
LOUISE: But it was n't ! We got away ! We were walkin ' away !
THELMA: They do n't know that ! It was just you and me there . I 'll say he raped me and you had to shoot him ! I mean , it 's almost the truth !
LOUISE: It wo n't work .
THELMA: Why not ? !
LOUISE: No physical evidence . We ca n't prove he did it . We probably ca n't even prove he touched you by now . They both pause for a moment .
THELMA: God . The law is some tricky shit , is n't it ? Then
LOUISE: Besides , what do we say about the obbery ? No excuse for that . No such thing as justifiable robbery .
THELMA: Alright , Louise !
DARRYL: Hey ! Hey !
HAL: That 's Thelma Dickinson 's husband .
MAX: Where did you get $ 6600.00 in cash ?
HAL: We spoke with a gentlemen today who says he personally delivered very close to that same amount to a Miss Louise Sawyer . Do you know her too ?
MAX: Did you know that Mrs. Dickinson and Miss Sawyer are wanted in connection with a murder ?
HAL: Did either of them ever indicate that they might be running from the Law ?
MAX: Yeah . Me too .
HAL: Do you mind if I have a word with him alone for a minute .
MAX: Oh , definitely .
HAL: Mr. Dickinson , if you 'll just hang on , I want a word with you and then we 'll take you home .
DARRYL: Come back here , you little shit !
LOUISE: Fill her up . There 's a phone right over there .
THELMA: Let 's get it over with . Thelma and Louise walk to the phone .
LOUISE: I 'm not kidding , Thelma . If you think he knows , even if you 're not sure , hang up .
DARRYL: Hello .
THELMA: Darryl . It 's me .
DARRYL: Thelma ! Hello !
THELMA: He knows .
HAL: Shit . Darryl still holds the phone in his hand .
DARRYL: What ? ! All I said was hello .
LOUISE: You got any change ?
DARRYL: Uh , no ! No , why would any police be here ? Hey , where are you girls , anyway ?
LOUISE: Let me talk to whoever 's in charge there ?
DARRYL: What are you talking about , Louise ?
HAL: Hello , Miss Sawyer . I 'm Hal Slocumbe , Chief Investigator , Homicide , Arkansas State Police . How are you ?
LOUISE: I 've been better .
HAL: You 're both okay ? Neither one of you hurt ? You 're bein ' careful with that gun ?
LOUISE: We 're both fine .
HAL: I just want you to know , neither one of you are charged with murder yet . You 're still just wanted fo questioning . Although , now , Mrs. Dickinson 's wanted in Oklahoma fo armed robbery .
LOUISE: No kiddin ' . Listen , we got ta go . I 'll call you back , all right ? Louise looks at her watch .
THELMA: What .
LOUISE: How 'd they find out we 're going to Mexico , Thelma , how they know that ?
THELMA: I I
LOUISE: You told that thievin ' little shit where we were goin ' ? !
THELMA: I just told him if he ever gets to Mexico to look us up . I asked him not to tell . I did n't think he would tell anybody .
LOUISE: Why not ? ! What 's he got to lose ? Other than my life 's savings , that is . Shit ! Louise careens back onto the road .
THELMA: I 'm sorry . I mean I Louise slams on the brakes .
LOUISE: Goddamnit , Thelma ! Let me explain something to you . Right now we have only two things goin ' for us . One , nobody knows where we are , and two , nobody knows where we 're going . Now , one of our things that was going for us is gone !
THELMA: You 're right .
LOUISE: Now what what ?
THELMA: Whaddo we do ?
LOUISE: Oh , I do n't know , Thelma . I guess maybe we could turn ourselves in and spend our lives trading cigarettes for mascara so we can look nice when our families come to visit us on Saturdays . Maybe we could have children with the prison guards .
THELMA: I 'm not suggestin ' that ! I 'm not goin ' back . No matter what happens . So do n't worry about me . Louise speeds up .
LOUISE: Yeah .
THELMA: Of all the things in the world that scare you , what 's the worst thing that scares you the most ?
LOUISE: You mean now or before ?
THELMA: Before .
LOUISE: I guess I always thought the worst thing that could happen would be to end up old and alone in some crummy apartment with one of those little dogs .
THELMA: What little dogs ?
LOUISE: You know those little dogs you see people with ?
THELMA: Like a Chihuahua ?
LOUISE: Those , too , but you know those little hairy ones ? Those flat-faced little fuckers with those ugly goddamned teeth ?
THELMA: Oh yeah . You mean Peek-a-poos .
LOUISE: Yeah . Those . That always put the fear of God in me . What about you ?
THELMA: Well , to be honest , the idea of getting old with Darryl was kinda startin ' to get to me .
LOUISE: I can see that .
THELMA: I mean , look how different he looks just since high school . It 's bad enough I have to get old , but doin ' it with Darryl around is only gon na make it worse . I mean , I do n't think he 's gon na be very nice about it .
LOUISE: Well , now , maybe you wo n't have to .
THELMA: Always lookin ' on the bright side , are n't ya ?
LOUISE: Gosh . It sure is .
THELMA: I always wanted to travel . I just never got the opportunity .
LOUISE: Well , you got it now .
THELMA: Just ignore him .
LOUISE: Oh , Christ . I hate this guy .
THELMA: We should have just ignored him .
LOUISE: What ?
THELMA: Nothing . It 's not funny .
LOUISE: What ? What 's not funny , Thelma !
THELMA: Okay , but I ca n't say .
LOUISE: What ? !
THELMA: Harlan .
LOUISE: What ? ! What about him ? !
THELMA: Just the look on his face when you it 's not funny .
LOUISE: Now , Thelma , that is not
THELMA: Boy , he was n't expectin ' that !
LOUISE: Thelma !
THELMA: Suck my dick Boom ! ! Thelma is laughing wildly .
LOUISE: Thelma . It 's not funny .
THELMA: I know ! They both get quiet .
LOUISE: I do n't want to talk about it ! Thelma , I 'm not kidding ! Do n't you even
THELMA: in Texas did n't it ? That 's what happened Oh my God .
LOUISE: I 'm warning you , Thelma . You bette drop it right now ! I do n't want to talk about it !
THELMA: Okay , Louise It 's okay .
LOUISE: Shit ! Thelma , wake up ! Shit ! We 're gettin ' pulled over ! Thelma jumps awake .
THELMA: What ! What ! Oh shit ! Oh no !
LOUISE: I do n't know ! Shit ! Let 's just play it by ear . He may not know . He may just give me a ticket .
THELMA: Please , God , please do n't let us get caught . Please , please , please
LOUISE: Hello , Officer . Is there a problem ?
PATROLMAN: You wan na let me see your license , please ?
LOUISE: Oh yeah . She does and hands it to him .
THELMA: I told you to slow down . Hell , Officer , I told her to slow down .
LOUISE: About how fast was I going ?
PATROLMAN: About a hundred and ten . You wan na step out of the car , please ?
LOUISE: Yes .
PATROLMAN: You wan na come with me , please ? Walk around and get in the car , please .
LOUISE: In the back ?
PATROLMAN: Front .
LOUISE: Am I in trouble ?
PATROLMAN: As far as I 'm concerned , yes , ma'am , you are .
THELMA: Officer , I am so sorry about this . Could you let go of that ? He drops it .
LOUISE: I am really sorry about this .
THELMA: I swear , before yesterday , neithe one of us would have ever pulled a stunt like this . But if you eve met my husband , you 'd know why I just can You wan na step out of the car , please ? You wan na put your hands on you head , please ? Louise , shoot the adio .
LOUISE: What ?
THELMA: Shoot the radio !
PATROLMAN: Ma'am , please I got kids a wife
THELMA: You do ? Well , you 're lucky . You be sweet to 'em . Especially your wife . My husband was n't sweet to me and look how I turned out . Now go on , get in there .
LOUISE: Sorry !
THELMA: Hit it .
LOUISE: I believe you .
MAX: It 's just not working like this . We got ta do something . It 'd be one thing if these girls were hardened criminals , but Jesus , Hal , this is makin ' us look bad . I do n't know maybe they 're not movin ' . Maybe that little creep lied .
HAL: He 's got nothin ' to gain by lyin ' . Nothin ' at all . He already got all their money . I just do n't know what we 're dealin ' with here . Anyway , it went out again last night on Nationwide Teletype . Let 's just wait it out a little longer . She said she was gon na call back . Let 's just sit tight .
MAX: We do n't have a whole lotta choice , do we ? I ca n't figure out if they 're eal smart or just really , really lucky .
HAL: It do n't matter . Brains will only get you so far and luck always runs out .
THELMA: Louise are we still going to Mexico ?
LOUISE: Yes .
THELMA: Then are n't we going in the wrong direction ?
LOUISE: Well , I figure if you take a state policeman , shoot up his car , take his gun and lock him in the trunk , it 's best to just get on out of the state if you can .
THELMA: Just asking .
LOUISE: I do n't want to see any more beef jerky . I mean the next beef jerky you hand me is going out the window . It 's drivin ' me crazy . The whole car smells like it .
THELMA: It 's good . It 's what the pioneers ate .
LOUISE: I do n't care what the damn pioneers ate . You just keep that shit away from me , now I mean it . Thelma puts down her bag .
THELMA: Okay , okay I 've got some tequila . You want some tequila ?
LOUISE: You do ?
THELMA: Yeah , you want it ?
LOUISE: Yeah . Thelma starts to dig through her bag again .
THELMA: It 's in here somewhere .
LOUISE: Shit . I 'm gettin ' tired .
THELMA: Are you alright ? Louise does not really seem alright .
LOUISE: I think I 've really fucked up . I think I 've got us in a situation where we could both get killed . Why did n't we just go straight to the police .
THELMA: You know why . You already said .
LOUISE: What 'd I say again ?
THELMA: Nobody would believe us . We 'd still get in trouble . We 'd still have ou lives ruined . And you know what else ?
LOUISE: What ?
THELMA: That guy was hurtin ' me . And if you had n't come out when you did , he 'd a hurt me a lot worse . And probably nothin ' woulda happened to him . 'Cause everybody did see me dancin ' with him all night . And they woulda made out like I asked for it . And my life woulda been ruined a whole lot worse than it is now . At least now I 'm havin ' fun . And I 'm not sorry the son of a bitch is dead . I 'm only sorry that it was you that did it and not me . And if I have n't , I wan na take this time to thank you , Louise . Thank you for savin ' my ass .
LOUISE: I said all that ?
THELMA: No , Louise , you said the first part . I said all the rest .
LOUISE: Whatever .
MAX: Hello .
HAL: Hello , Louise .
LOUISE: Hey .
HAL: I swear . Louise , I almost feel like I know you .
LOUISE: No !
HAL: Then I 'm sorry . We 're gon na have to charge you with murder . Now , do you want to come out of this alive ?
LOUISE: You know , certain words and phrases just keep floating through my mind , things like incarceration , cavity search , life imprisonment , death by electrocution , that sort of thing . So , come out alive ? I do n't know . Let us think about that .
THELMA: Come on , Louise . Do n't blow it . Let 's go .
HAL: Max . You got ta take me there ! I 'm I 'm the only one she 's ever talked to . I do n't want anybody losin ' their heads . You know what happens . The volume gets turned way up and the next thing you know those girls are gon na get shot .
MAX: Okay , Hal , okay .
THELMA: Louise ?
LOUISE: Yes , Thelma ?
THELMA: You 're not gon na give up on me , are ya ?
LOUISE: What do you mean ?
THELMA: You 're not gon na make some deal with that guy , are you ? I mean , I just wan na know .

THELMA: I can understand if you 're thinkin ' about it . I mean , in a way , you 've got something to go back for . I mean Jimmy and everything .
LOUISE: Thelma , that is not an option .
THELMA: But I do n't know something 's crossed over in me and I ca n't go ack . I mean , I just could n't live
LOUISE: I know . I know what you mean . I do n't wan na end up on the damn Geraldo Show . They are both quiet for a moment .
THELMA: Eeuww .
LOUISE: And we have to decide whether we want to come out of this dead o alive .
THELMA: Gosh , did n't he say anything positive at all ?
LOUISE: Sure You know how to hotwire a car ?
THELMA: No .
LOUISE: Well , let me know when you figure it out .

LOUISE: We 'll be drinkin ' margaritas by the sea , Mamasita .
THELMA: We can change our names .
LOUISE: We can live in a hacienda .
THELMA: I wan na get a job . I wan na work at Club Med .
LOUISE: Yes ! Yes ! Now what kind of deal do you think that cop can come up with to beat that ?
THELMA: It 'd have to be pretty good .
LOUISE: It would have to be pretty damn good .
THELMA: You 're drivin ' .
LOUISE: It 's him . He 's got California plates . It 's the same guy .
THELMA: Pass him !
TRUCKER: Hi there ! You alright ?

SINGS: My sleep grows ever quiete only my grief , like a veil , lies trembling over me . I often hear you in my dreams calling outside my door THE THEORY of EVERYTHING 56
JONATHAN: Actually , no , I go for the Gospel of St. Mark .
JANE: None of that wishy-washy do-goode stuffMatthew , Luke .
JONATHAN: Exactly . With Mark you roll up you sleeves and get stuck in . No standing on the sidelines .
JANE: Well I should be going .
JONATHAN: Well met . Oh , and if your daughte would like those piano lessons .
JANE: Absolutely . My husband loves music too .
JONATHAN: I could teach him as well .
JANE: Well , that 's a long story . 'Night .

ANNOYANCE SHOWING: Stephen 's done a U-turn . The big new idea is that the universe has no boundaries at all . No oundaries , no beginning . No
JONATHAN: - no God ? Really ?
TO STEPHEN: Fascinating . Because I 'd understood you 'd proven the need for a Creator . My mistake .
STEPHEN: No . Mine .
UNDERSTANDING THIS: Yours . Your mistake ?
JANE: Stephen is looking for a single law that governs all the forces in the universe . So God must die .

JANE: The two great pillars of physics
THE PEA: - Quantum Theory , the laws that govern the very smallelectrons , particles so onand General Relativity

JANE: Einstein 's theory .
THE POTATO: Which governs the very large , planets and suchbut Quantum -
JONATHAN: They'redifferent ?
JANE: They do n't remotely play by the same rules . Peas are chaotic , and do n't behave predictably at all -
JANE: Which you can set your watch by .

JANE: Seems he not only plays dice -
STEPHEN: - he throws them - where we ca n't find them .
JANE: - he throws them -
JONATHAN: - where we ca n't find them . How inconvenient !

RESIGNED: We 'll know everything .
JONATHAN: It was leukaemia . Coming up on a year ago . She fought it , I nursed her , but in the end Music is my salvation . Teaching and playing . I 've struggled with loneliness , of course . Tyranny of the empty room , all that . Music is a consolation , although my career Well , I 'm not very ambitious .

JANE: Thank you for coming .
JONATHAN: No . Thank you . It was wonderful . And ifif there was anything I can do . To be of service . To you , you family . I have no children , no commitments . If I could help you , I elieve I would find a purpose that would alleviate my own situation . It would be a privilege .

JANE: Stephen must live ! You have to ing him round from the anaesthetic !
SWISS DOCTOR: Are you sure this is what you want ? The only way of weaning him off the ventilator would be to give him a tracheotomy , a hole in the neck , by-passing the throat . He will never speak again .

SIGHS: Lately I 've been feeling likewelllike a loser .
DOM: Loser ? You ? Ted shrugs . DOM Give me a break . Remember five years ago , when your kidneys failed ? If you were a loser would they have been able to find a donor with an exact tissue match ? What are the odds of that , one in a million ?
TED: Oh , so I 'm lucky because my brother got killed in an explosion ?
DOM: I never said that . I 'm saying your lucky those kids found his kidneys . Besides , your brother Jimmy never gave a shit about you . Ted gives him a look . DOM You know , you 're a real glass-is-half-empty guy . You got a fucking guardian angel , man .

TED: Nah .
DOM: Never ?
TED: Well once . Mary . Dom SIGHS .
DOM: Mary again .
TED: Look , I admit it was brief , but it was definitely love . Crushes do n't last twelve years .

TED: I told you , her family moved to Miami .
DOM: I mean since then .
TED: I do n't know .
DOM: Well why do n't you look her up ?
TED: Yeah , right .
DOM: Why not ?
TED: Because I guarantee she 's married and has a couple kids . Girls like Mary do n't stay single .
DOM: What if you 're wrong ? You just said she 's the only girl you ever loved , what have you got to lose by calling her ?
TED: I did try calling her . A few years ago . She was n't listed .
DOM: So that was it ? One bump in the road and you gave up ?
TED: I also called Unsolved Mysteries .
DOM: You 're kidding ? What did they say ?
TED: They told me they do n't help out stalkers . Look , maybe they 're right , it 's been a long time .
DOM: I got ityou hire a private eye , fly him out there , he follows her around a couple days , she 'll never know a thing . Ted considers this .
TED: No . No fucking way . That 's too creepy . Dom thinks a moment , then SNAPS his fingers .
DOM: Wait a second . There 's a guy named Healy in my office who might be able to help you out . He 's a claims investigator and he goes to Miami every couple weeks . As Ted thinks about this , we
TED: I do n't know about this , Dom .
DOM: Relax , this guy owes me a big one . A couple years ago he got in a jam up in the Boston office ; some bullshit about padding his esumelike we have n't all done that . Anyway , they were going to let him go but his mother wrote a tear-jerker letter that ended up on my desk .
TED: His mother ?
DOM: Yeah , I guess he still lives with her . Seemed like a sweet ladygot diabetes o somethingso I went out on a limb and got him transferred down to Providence .
TED: And you think he could find out her numbe for me ?
DOM: He 'll do better than that . I 'll send him down to Miami on business , you throw him a couple bucks on the side , and he 'll track her down . Ted thinks about this . DOM Just let me warn youThis guy runs a little hot , but he gets the job done .
HEALY: So , Dom tells me you 're looking for some lady-friend you knew in high school .
TED: Uh-huh .
HEALY: Any idea where I might start looking ?
TED: She moved to Miami Beach twelve years ago . I checked directory assistance down there and she 's not listed . She might 've moved ten times since then .
HEALY: All you want is a phone number ?

MARY: Neighborhood Watch ? Is that what you call listening in on stranger 's phone conversations ?
MARY: Meaning ?
MAGDA: Meaning these are the people you live amongst , you got a right to know if they 're creeps . For instance , did you know there 's a guy down the hall cheating on his wife ?
MARY: You picked that up on the scanner . We got ta move .
MAGDA: I confirmed it on the scanner . I knew something was up because Puffy used to bark like hell whenever he saw him and you know Puffy only barks at bad people . Magda pats her little dog PUFFY on the head .
MARY: Magda , Puffy barks at everybody .
MAGDA: That 's because there 's a lot of bad people out there . Hey , Puffy tried to warn you about that Steve guy you was seeinghe was a fucking asswipebut you had to find out for yourself , did n't you ?

MARY: Ugh , not pecs . Sounds like one of those guys with a fish-net shirt and a banana hammock .
HEALY: A girl after your own heart , Ted . U > BACK ON Mary and friends .
JOANIE: I can live with those reflections .
MARY: I 'm sick of these calorie-countin ' pansies . Give me a guy who likes kielbasa and bee and playing thirty-six holes and still has enough energy to take me and Warren out to a ballgame .
JOANIE: Jeez , I do n't know where you 're ever going to find a guy like that .
MARY: But here 's the rub . The guy I 'm talking about has got to be self-employed .
LISA: You mean , like an architect or something ?
MARY: Architect , yeah . BRENDA You mean creative , but not poor .
LISA: And where would you and your beer-bellied architect be leaving to ?
MARY: I do n't know . The Super Bowl , New Orleans Jazz Festivalmaybe a couple months in Nepal .
JOANIE: Yeah , and you 'd probably dump the poor guy halfway to Katmandu .
MARY: What 's that supposed to mean ?
JOANIE: It means you 're too hard on guys .

JOANIE: Oh come off it , Mare . What about what's-his-nameSteverino ? You could 've at least passed the baton on that one . The girls LAUGH .
MARY: Yeah , Steve . Steve was all right fo awhile .
JOANIE: All right for awhile ? The guy 's good-looking , rich , witty . He was a god .
LISA: At one point you were talking about marrying him . Come on , why 'd you dump him ? Mary thinks about this .
MARY: I do n't know , it was complicated . He 's in San Francisco , I 'm in Miami . Besides , Magda 's psychic dog hated him .
JOANIE: Is that old crab still with you ? Mary , you said you were putting her up for a monthit 's been a year and a half .
MARY: Ah , she 's okay .
LISA: Mary , cut the crap , what really happened with Steve ?
MARY: Nothing . I mean , you know my brother . Warren .
JOANIE: What ? Steve seemed to put up with Warren .
BRENDA: Well , that 's the last time I blow him U > behind your back . As the girls LAUGH , we

MARY: What 's that ?
HEALY: I work with retards .

MARY: No , I mean
HEALY: There 's this one kid , we call him Mongo on account of he 's a mongoloid . He got out of his cage once and

TED: That sneaky prick was probably practicing his jai alai . Dom shakes his head . Then
DOM: Well then you 've got to call her , man .
TED: Fuck calling her . I 'm going down there .
MAGDA: So who 's the lucky guy ?
MARY: Name 's Patrick , I met him at the driving ange .
MAGDA: Good lookin ' ?
MARY: He 's no Steve Young .
MAGDA: Then why you going out with him if he 's a schlep ?
MARY: Come on , Magda
SIGHS: It 's like that movie Harold and Maude .
MAGDA: I do n't watch the new ones .
MARY: This one 's almost thirty years old . It 's about a young kid and an old lady who fall in love .
MAGDA: That 's exactly why I do n't watch 'em anymoreit 's bullshit ! Why the hell would an old lady go for a young kid ? Mary smiles at this .
MARY: The point is , love is n't about money o social standing or age , it 's about
MAGDA: Fuck kindred spirits . My little Puffy here 's gon na tell you all you need to know about this guy in about two seconds flat . If he starts yapping , he 's a loser ; if Puffy 's relaxedwell , you got yourself a keeper .
HEALY: Oh , Pufferball likes his little tum-tum ubbed , does n't he now ?
MARY: Wow , I 've never seen him like this . He does n't usually like guys .
MAGDA: You mean he does n't like bad guys .
HEALY: 'That right ?
MAGDA: He can tell you 're an animal nut . You are , are n't ya ?
HEALY: Truth is I usually get along better with animals than with people . In Nepal the villagers call me 'Kin-tan-tee ' , which means 'man who is loved by many animals who love him a lot , tooand so on . ' Magda stares dreamily at Healy , smitten .
MAGDA: Would you like a glass of tea or something ?
HEALY: You got a brew ?

MARY: The architecture exhibit ! My friend Tucke is going to be here . He 's an architect , too . You guys will have tons to talk about .
HEALY: What say we get outta here and go crush a ucket ?
MARY: We just got here thirty seconds ago . Is n't this stuff great ? Mary points to an architectural model . MARY Is this one art deco or art nouveau ?
HEALY: Deco .
MARY: Would you call that a portico or a vestibule ?
HEALY: That ? Vestibule .
MARY: How about ?
HEALY: When you look at architecture , try not to concern yourself with the pieceslook at the building in its totalitarianism .
MARY: Tucker ! Mary leads Healy over to her friend TUCKER , a
TUCKER: Come on , like you mean it . Mary LAUGHS and hugs Tucker tighter . Then
MARY: Tucker , this is my friend Pat Healy . Healy and Tucker shake hands .

HEALY: Among others .
TUCKER: Kim and I are close friends !
HEALY: Well , I 'll tell her I ran into you .
TUCKER: You mean him .
HEALY: Wellthat 's debatable .
HEALY: Nice smokescreen , is n't it ? Tucker can hardly believe his ears .
MARY: Pat does projects all over the world .
TUCKER: Where would I have seen your work ?
HEALY: Have you been to Let 's seeSantiago , Chile ?
TUCKER: Absolutely ! I was there twice last year . Which building is yours ?
HEALY: Do you know thesoccer stadium ?

HEALY: Nojust down the street , the Amigo Tower .
TUCKER: I 'm sorry , I 'm not familiar with it . What style ?
HEALY: Uh , sort of nouveau decowith a big vestibule . Check it out next time you 're up there . Tucker starts to look a little suspicious .
TUCKER: You know , I really should take your card .
HEALY: Oh look , it 's Doob ! Will you excuse me a minute , Tucker ?
MAN: My name 's Mel .
HEALY: Oh , sorry . Anyone ever tell you you look just like Jim Dubois ?
MAN: The sheepfucker ? Healy shrugs and the man walks away angrily .
HITCHHIKER: Thanks for picking me up .
TED: No prob , I could use the company . I 've been on the road going on fifteen hours straight .
HITCHHIKER: I know how you feelI been standing in the same spot for the last five hours . You know it 's against the law to pick up a hitchhiker in this state .
TED: That must make it tough .
HITCHHIKER: Sucks . So what 's up ? You some kind of salesman or something ?
TED: Nah . I'mI 'm nothing .
HITCHHIKER: Oh . Well I am .
TED: Hm ?
HITCHHIKER: A salesmanthat 's what I am . I mean , I 'm gon na be anyway . I 'm starting my own companyvideo salesjust as soon as I get enough seed money .
TED: 'That right ? Good for you .
HITCHHIKER: Yeah , you would n't believe my ideait 's a home run . You ever hear of Eight-Minute U > Abs ?
TED: The exercise tape ? Sure , I 've seen it on
HITCHHIKER: Two million copies it sold last year . Two
TED: I see where you 're going .
HITCHHIKER: Think about it . You walk into a video store and you see Eight-Minute Abs and ight next to it you see Seven-Minute
TED: I 'd go with the seven .
HITCHHIKER: Bingo . Especially since we guarantee you 'll get every bit as good a work-out .
TED: How do you guarantee that ?
HITCHHIKER: Well it 's the company motto 'If you ai n't happy we 'll send you the extra minute . '
TED: Huh . That sounds great . Unless someone else comes out with Six-Minute Abs .
POLICE OFFICER: Yeah , I 'll bet you all were . Come on , in the truck .
TED: Okay , take it easy , you do n't have to push .
DOM: Oh my God . Is that ?
DOM'S WIFE: Told you he was gay .
TED: I was taking a leak !
HEALY: That grandmother of yoursshe 's really something .
MARY: Magda ? She 's not my grandmotheractually she rents the apartment right next to mine . Her husband passed away a couple years ago so she does n't like to be alone .
HEALY: And it does n't cramp your style ?
MARY: Sadly , no . Well except for the lint .
HEALY: Lint ?
MARY: Yeah , I think it 's that dog of hers running around on the rug all dayjust makes for a lot of lint . Look at this
HEALY: You know , sometimes I wish I could be like Magda and not go home . I 'd like to just ounce around for awhile , do a little traveling
MARY: Why bounce when you have your own condo in Nepal to go to ? It 's clear Healy forgot about that one .
HEALY: Ah , I 'd sell that . Start fresh in a new place , quit the architect game , slow things down , read more books , see more movies
MARY: You 're a movie buff ?
HEALY: Try to be . It 's tough going with the crap
MARY: Have you seen it ?
HEALY: No . But the Boston Globe critic Jay Ca hated it .
MARY: A fucking moron .
HEALY: Huh . I guess I just wish they made them like they used to . You know , something like U > The Heartbreak Kidor Harold and U > Maude . Mary ca n't believe her ears .
HEALY: Ouch . Come on , do n't bust my chops . I know it 's corny , but I do love it .
MARY: Pat , I 'm not kidding . I really think it 's the greatest
HEALY: Love story of our time . Mary smiles . Is this guy for real ?
MARY: Yeah .
HEALY: Wow . I thought I was the only one .
MARY: So
HEALY: YeahI guess this is it , huh ?
MARY: I guess .
HEALY: Well , I 'll see ya . Healy turns to go but stops . HEALY Mary ah , forget it .
MARY: What ?
HEALY: No , forget it , it was stupid .
MARY: Come on , what were you going to say ?
HEALY: Nah , really , it was moronic . She grabs him by the shirt playfully .
MARY: Just say it . U > Healy takes a deep breath .
HEALY: Could I feel your bosoms before I go ? Mary just stares at him . MARY Knock yourself out .
DETECTIVE FRANEK: Man , they never look like you 'd expect .

TED: Oh . The hitchhiker .
CHUCKLES: That 's what this is all about . Ted puts his head in his hands and smiles . TED Is n't that just my luckI get caught fo everything .
DETECTIVE CAVALLO: So you admit it ?
TED: Guilty as charged . I 'm not gon na play games with you . I could give you a song and dance ut what 's the point ? I did it and we all know it . The hitcher himself told me it 's illegal The irony .
DETECTIVE CAVALLO: Well , uh , can you tell us his name ?
TED: Jeez , I did n't catch it . The Detectives flinch at his glib demeanor .
DETECTIVE FRANEK: So he was a stranger ? It was totally andom ?
TED: He was the first hitcher I saw , what can I tell you ? Now cut to the chase , how much trouble am I in ? The Detectives look at one another .
DETECTIVE FRANEK: First tell us why you did it .
TED: Why I did it ? I do n't know . Boredom ? I thought I was doing the guy a favor . The Detectives look at each other .
DETECTIVE CAVALLO: This was n't your first time , was it , Ted ? How many we talking ?

MARY: Behave yourself , Tucker . Come on , what are you doing here ?
TUCKER: I wanted to talk to you about your friend Patrick .
MARY: Not long at all , but I really like him . Okay , I know he 's a little different , Tucker , but that 's what I like about him . He 's a guy . A real guy . He dresses like a dork and eats corndogs and he is n't always politically correct and he probably farts , too . And that 's okay with me .
TUCKER: That 's what you 've been looking fora farter ?
TUCKER: Look , it 's just that something about him struck me as odd last night . He gave me this funny vibe . Anyway , I called some friends back east . They do n't know of any architect named Patrick Healy and he 's not listed as a Harvard alumnus .
HEALY: Fuck ! !
TUCKER: I thought so . Anyway , I hope you do n't think I 'm being meddlesome . I just think you should be careful with this guy .
MARY: No no no , Tucker , thank you .
TUCKER: I mean let 's face it , Mary , you 're eautiful , you 've got money , you trust peopleI 'm just saying , there 's a lot of psychos out there .
MARY: I appreciate you looking out for me .

TED: And this adversely affects me how ?
DOM: Do n't you see ? Healy lied to us about
DOM: His address in Miami . You know , when you think about it , we really do n't know the first thing about this guy . Finally the implications of this dawn on Ted .
TED: Jesus Christ what have I done ?
LISA: You 're not seriously thinking about going out with this guy again ?
JOANNIE: Mary , he sounds like a psycho !
MAGDA: Would you hens quit ya cackling and let he do what she wants to do . Puffy liked him and Puffy 's never wrong . The girlfriends roll their eyes .
BRENDA: Mary , the guy 's full of shit .
MARY: What if he 's not ? What if Tucker just made an honest mistake ?
LISA: What if he did n't ? It 's clear that Mary is torn .
MARY: I do n't know how I can bail now , he 's going to be here any minute .
JOANNIE: Well then blow him off when he gets here .

LISA: Mr . Perfect , huh ? Mary starts to feel like a fool .
MARY: Turn it up , Magda .
HEALY: Ahh .
SULLY: Come on , you could tell her about the irrigation ditches you dug in Sudan , the orphan babies who cried in your arms in Romania the hope you gave Freddie the leper in Calcutta
JOANNIE: I love this man . Magda folds her arms and gloats .
HEALY: Look , I did all those things for myself . I 'll be honest with you , I 'm a selfish prick . I get a high from helping all of God 's creatures . An honest to goodness high .
SULLY: That 's bullshit , man you , uh , you were on the front line . Remember the , uh , malaria the , uh , typhoon fever that vicious strain of genital herpes ?

TED: Mary , we have n't seen each other in twelve years . Do n't make me wait another day . Mary seems touched by this .
MARY: Tell me where you 're staying . I 'll pick you up at eight . Ted finally smiles and we
MAGDA: Do n't bet on it . Last time I had a pap smear the guy needed leather gloves and an oyster shucker .
MARY: So maybe I could find a nice gentleman to take you to the movies .
MAGDA: Knock it off , Pollyanna , just 'cause you 're in love does n't mean everyone else has to e .
MARY: Love ? Come on , I would n't call it love .
MAGDA: Oh no ? I ai n't seen you beaming like this since you broke ninety on the Blue Monster .
HEALY: No ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! MARY We 're gon na go out tonight . Oh , that eminds me , I 've got to call what's-his-face and cancel .
MAGDA: Do I sense a chill in the air ? Mary sits down .
MARY: Oh , Magda , I let my head get in the way of my love life . I always pick guys on what I feel in here . But with this Pat guy my head kept saying & quot ; Grow up , Mary . You have a lot in common with this one , you 'll grow to feel
HEALY: Hey , Patty-boy here . Sorry I missed ya , but I 'm out rustling up some champagne and oses in preparation for the greatest irthday of my life . Hope you and yours are having a good day , too .
MARY: Uh , hi Pat , it 's me , Mary . Just wanted to say I'mlooking forward to tonight . She hangs up .
MAGDA: You vicious bitch , how do you sleep at night ?
MARY: I ca n't do itI just found out it 's his irthday . I guess I 've got ta cancel on Ted .
TUCKER: There she isI brought you a little thirst-quencher , Mag .
MAGDA: Oh , you are sweet .
TUCKER: No , I 'm not . I just want to get you-drunk so you 'll pass out and I can have my way with Mary . Everyone LAUGHS .
MARY: Can I pour you one ?
TUCKER: Thanks , but I 've got to be going . Unfortunately , Doc , this is n't a social visit .
MARY: What 's up ?
TUCKER: WellI 've got a little more news about your friend Healy . Mary seems relieved .
MARY: I know what you 're going to say , but he already told me everything . I know he 's not an architect . Tucker pulls out a piece of paper . TUCKER I think you 'd better sit down .
TUCKER: Mary , the man 's a killer . U > ON HEALY - he ca n't believe his ears .
MARY: What ?
TUCKER: I 've got a friend in the Boston police department . He faxed me this this morning . I 'll just give you the highlights . After a short stint as a petty thief , Patrick R. Healy graduated to armed robbery y the age of fourteen . At sixteen he committed his first murdera pretty teacher 's aid named Molly Pettygrove . He was incarcerated until age twenty-two when , despite a grim psychological profile , the state was forced to release him . In his mid-twenties and again in his early thirties he was suspected of homicides in the states of Utah and Washington . Unfortunately , the bodies were so badly decomposed that there was n't enough evidence to hold him , and on and on and so forth and so on . Mary looks like she 's going to throw up .
MARY: Magda !
MAGDA: The little shit lied to me about that guy ! Mary picks up the startled dog and pets him .
MARY: I ca n't believe this is happening . I 'm supposed to be meeting him in an hour .
TUCKER: Okay , just calm down . It 's going to be okay . Tucker puts his arms around her .
MAGDA: Why you two never hooked up is beyond me . Mary looks fondly at Tucker .
MARY: Magda 's right , I 'm so lucky to have you in my life .
TUCKER: Do n't get all gooey on me now , you 'll give me a big head . The important thing , Doctor , is you 've got to distance yourself as much as possible without pissing this psycho off .
MARY: Yeah , yeah . Okay , I think I know what to do . I 'll call him right now .
HEALY: Hi , I 'm out drinking champagne and osesand I 'm really happy . Leave a message . BEEP .
TED: Oh God , I 'm fucking nervous . I do n't know if I 'm ready for this , man .
DOM: Just relax . Have you hit the cash machine ?
TED: Got cash .
DOM: Car clean ? Plenty of gas ?
TED: Check .
DOM: Mints ?
TED: Copped a tin of Altoids at the car wash. Dom nods , satisfied .
DOM: Okay , sounds like you 're all set . Just clean the pipes and it 's a go .
TED: Hm ?
DOM: You know , clean the pipes .
TED: Pipes ? What are you talking about ?
DOM: You jerk off before all big dates , right ? Tell me you jerk off before your big dates . Ted just stares at him . DOM You do n't jerk off before ? ! Are you crazy ? ! That 's like going out there with a loaded gun . No wonder you 're nervous ! Ted considers this . DOM Think about it After you 've had sex with a girl and the two of you are laying in bed , are you nervous ?
TED: No . Dom shrugsDuh .
DOM: Why 's that ?
TED: I 'm usually too tired to be . Dom makes a game-show BUZZER sound .
DOM: Wrong . It 's because you ai n't got the baby atter in your brain any more . That 'll fuck with your head , that stuff will .
TED: Huh .
DOM: The most honest moment in a man 's life is the five minutes after he 's blown a load . That 's a medical fact . And it 's because you 're no longer trying to get laid . You 're actually thinking like a girl . They love that .
TED: Jesus Christ you 're right .
DOM: You bet your ass I 'm right . You do n't go out with a loaded gun , you empty the arrels !
TED: Holy shit , I 've been going out with a loaded gun !
DOM: People get hurt that way .
TED: Hey .
MARY: Hi , Ted .
TED: You look great .
MARY: Thanks . She notices something . MARY What 's that ?
TED: Hm ?
MARY: On your ear , you 've got something .
TED: Sure .
MARY: Oh great , I ran out .
TUCKER: Okay , Pat , take it easydo n't do anything stupid .
HEALY: Who the fuck do you think you are making up that bullshit about me ? ! Healy SLAMS HIM AGAINST THE TREE AGAIN .
TUCKER: Whoa , whoaI do n't know what you 're talking about .
HEALY: Maybe this 'll jog your memory . Healy SLAPS him across the face . HEALY I 'll give you a hintit 's got something to do with me being a murderer .
TUCKER: Okay , okay , I might 've gotten some bad information . Healy grabs him by the collar .
HEALY: That stalker Ted got to you , right ? You 're working for him , are n't you , you little shit ?
TUCKER: Who ?
HEALY: This is your last chance , you fuck . Now either you come clean or I 'm going to kick your ass from here to Tallahassee .
TUCKER: I LOVE HER , OKAY ? !
HEALY: You what ?
TUCKER: You heard me , goddamnit . II love her . Healy slowly lets go . TUCKER I 'm a phonyjust like you , man .
HEALY: What do you mean ?
TUCKER: I mean I 'm a fucking fraud . I 'm no architect . Do n't be a putzwho 's been to Santiago twice in a year ? U > Estadio Olimpicoplease !
HEALY: Butbut you knew people at Harvard .
TUCKER: I knew shit . The only thing I knew was that you were a fake and I made up everything else . My real name 's Norm . I deliver pizzas .
HEALY: Bullshit !
TED: Thanks , that 's great . The WAITER turns to Mary .
WAITER: Madame ?
MARY: Thank you . The waiter pours her a glass and leaves .
TED: Now by killer , you mean ?
MARY: I mean he murdered someone and did time ack in Boston . The guy 's a freak .
TED: Jeez , MaryI 'm
MARY: Well , lucky for me I found out . Thank God I have friends like Tucker . Look , I 'm sick of talking about stalkers . Let 's talk about you .
TUCKER: So then in '94 I went back to Dade Community College for a semester and when the Wal-Mart cashier job fell through I hooked up with the Pizza Barn .
HEALY: And you met Mary how ?
TUCKER: Just dumb luck . I delivered a pie to he one night and she answered the door in he nightgownthat was it for me . I went home that night , shaved my beard , and a week later I was laid out in her office with a oken back .
HEALY: How 'd you manage that one ?
TUCKER: Friend . Baseball bat .
HEALY: Nice .
TUCKER: Oh yeah , the plan was going along just fine until you showed up .
HEALY: Hey , hey , hey , I 'm not the one who started telling bald-faced lies about the competitionthat 's crossing the line !
TUCKER: What line ? The day you first laid your oily ap on my future wife you started a war !
HEALY: Future wife ? Get real , manyou 're nothing more than a glorified brother in her eyes .
TUCKER: Why you son of a Tucker grabs Healy by the jacket .
HEALY: Okay , calm down , calm downthe bottom line is neither of us are going to get her if we do n't do something about that headcase she 's with now . As Tucker slowly releases him , we
MARY: You hit the ball pretty good for a fourteen .
TED: No short game . She smiles .
MARY: We should play some timeI mean , if you can afford to lose some money .
TED: What are you ?
MARY: Twenty-two .
TED: Bullshit , a twenty-two does n't carry a one-irondo n't sandbag me , lady . Mary smiles coyly .
MARY: Okay , sometimes I 'm a nineteen .
TED: That 's more like it . Two more nitrate-sicles please .
MARY: Nitrate-siclesI like that .
TED: I say they should put more meats on a stick , you know ? They got a lot of sweets on stickspopsicles , fudgesicles , lollipopsbut hardly any meat .
MARY: I agree there should be more .
TED: You know what I 'd like to see ? Meat in a cone . You could put corned beef hash in a cone , or chopped liver .
MARY: I like it . And think of the toppingscheese , mushrooms , mint jelly
TED: Not to mention ketchup and hot peppers . They smile at one another .
MARY: It 's too bad you do n't live down here , Ted .
TED: Yeah ?
MARY: We 've got a lot in common . Ted takes a chance .
TED: Wellwhy do n't you move back ?
MARY: Ah , my roots here are too deep . I love my practice , the people I work with , Warren 's got a nice thing going Why do n't you just move down here and marry me ?
TED: Trying to be .
MARY: Well good for you . I bet it works out fo you .
TED: We 'll see . If it does n't , what the hell , at least I gave it a shot .
MARY: That 's right . And the good thing is you can do it anywhere .
TED: What about you , Mare ? How the hell 'd you manage to stay single ?
MARY: I do n't knowMy friends think I 'm too picky . I think I 'm just a weirdo magnet . I did come close oncejust last year , in fact . There was this guy he lived in San Francisco .
TUCKER: That stalkin ' son-of-a-bitch !
HEALY: Fucking sickening . Healy and Tucker duck back into the alley .
TUCKER: Four .
HEALY: That seems like a lot of speed for a little poochyou sure it wo n't kill him ?
TUCKER: I never said that . As Tucker throws another
MARY: and then it was all over .
SIGHS: We have n't spoken since .
TED: Wow . That 's too bad . He sounds almost perfect .
MARY: Yeahalmost . You want to come up and watch Sportscenter ?
TED: Uh no . I think I 'm gon na get out while I 'm ahead . Mary looks a little disappointed .
MARY: Tedyou 're not that far ahead .
TED: Look , Mary , the truth isI 'll be in town for a while now but I do n't think we should see each other for a few weeks .
MARY: Why not ?
TED: Wellto be honest.I 'm really crazy about you and it 's making me nervous and when I get nervous I 'm not myself and I 'm afraid I 'm going to doing something really dumb before we get started so I think I should just lay back until I regain my composure . Mary sort of smiles .
MARY: That 's really sweet , Ted , but you should save it for one of your books .
TED: All right , let 's go .
MARY: Magda , what are you doing ?
MAGDA: Oh , hi hon . Just straightening up .
MARY: Where 's Puffy ?
MAGDA: Ah , he was being a pest so I put him in the athroom .
MARY: Um , Ted , I need a moment with Magdawould you let the dog out of the bathroom .
TED: Yeah , sure .
MAGDA: Stop it , you 're hurting him !
TED: Tell himto calm down .
TED: Hey .

TED: What do you mean ?
MARY: It 's not trueright , Ted ? Ted CLEARS HIS THROAT .
TED: Well , funny story there . You see , uh , it started out as a uhyeahit 's true . = Mary stands up .
MARY: Get out .
TED: Wait , hold on , Maryit 's not as bad as it sounds . I certainly did n't know
MARY: That you put a murderer on my trail ?
TED: Well yeah , I did n't know much about him . I just thought
MARY: What did you think , Ted ? That you could spy on me and trick me into thinking you were someone I couldreally go for ? Mary starts to get emotional .
TED: Mary , I swear I was n't trying to trick you .
MARY: Then what the fuck did you do it for ?
TED: I did it because because I 'd neve stopped thinking about you and if I did n't find you I knew my life would never be good again . Mary looks away .
MARY: Please leave .
TED: Mary , come on
MARY: Go !
TED: Okay . And so Ted does .
HEALY: Ho-ly shit .
TUCKER: Hey , this is a pretty nice place .
HEALY: Sully ! What the fuck happened here ? !
TED: Surprised ?
TUCKER: Hey , buddy , do n't do anything rash now .
TED: Who the fuck are you ?
HEALY: He 's in love with Mary , too . Ted releases Healy and glares at him .
TED: You fucked me , man ? Why would you do that ?
HEALY: What do you mean 'why ' ?
TED: Answer the question , shitball .
TUCKER: I think everybody could use a drink . Tucker goes into the kitchen .
HEALY: Look , you asked me to follow your girl around , and I did and I started to like her , and then I realized I just could n't in good conscience do it .
TED: Do what ?
HEALY: Turn her over to a stalker .
TED: What ? ! You 're calling me a stalker ?
HEALY: That 's rightif you were n't you would 've looked for her yourself !
TED: You 're a sick man , you know that ?
HEALY: Yeah well fuck you ! You just ca n't stand the fact that it was my turn .
TED: Your turn ?
TED: Well you did n't have to blow us both out of the water . Jesus Christ , just because she found out about you , why 'd you have to take me down with you ?
HEALY: I do n't know what you 're talking about .
TED: I 'm talking about the letter , asshole .
HEALY: What ? Ted stares at him .
TED: Are you telling me you did n't send Mary a letter outlining our deal ?
HEALY: Why the fuck would I do that ? I 'd be screwing myself .
TUCKER: What ?
HEALY: You fucking prick , we had a dealyou said you would n't fuck me and I would n't fuck you until we had this fuck out of the fucking picture . You crossed the line , man . Tucker backs away nervously .
TUCKER: Whoa , whoa , you 're getting crazy now . Why would I cross the linewhat do you think I got no pride ? Healy grabs Tucker by the neck . TUCKER I swear ! I did n't tell her nothing ! You probably did it yourself , you piece of shit .
HEALY: Oh that makes a lot of sense . Why would I at myself out ?
TUCKER: Like I 'm going to try to figure out a guy who 's idea of courting is blowing farts in the chick 's face
HEALY: You were following us ?
TUCKER: Do n't flatter yourselfI was following
TED: You meanSteve did n't say all that stuff about Warren ?
TUCKER: Are you shitting meMr . Goody-Two-Shoes ? He was like a fucking eagle scout . You two should be kissing my ballsif it was n't for me , she might 've married that schmuck ! Ted thinks about this .
TED: The hell with you bothI 'm out of here .

DOM: All right , I did , but I was in a weird place then . He approaches her . DOM Give me a break , Mare , I was nuts ! Mary backs into the living room .
HEALY: Who the hell 's Woogie ? Tucker just shrugs . U > BACK ON Mary and Dom . =~
MARY: I 'm asking you to leave .
DOM: Oh , Mary , honey , you 're taking this all wrong . I 'm not leaving
MARY: Stop it !
DOM: Just one pair ! You owe me that much , you heartless bitch !
HEALY: Dom , you 're pathetic , fucking over you friend Ted like that .
DOM: What ? You fucked him over , too .
HEALY: He 's no friend of mine .
MAGDA: What the hell 's going on here ? At first no one knows what to say . Then
HEALY: We 're in love with your roommate .
MAGDA: Aw , Christ , I ca n't take it anymore . I 'm gon na pack my bags and go back to my own place .
MARY: Tucker , where are your crutches ? Tucker is stumped for a second , then
TUCKER: Interesting query , Mary Healy slaps Tucker in the back of the head .
HEALY: Shut the fuck up and tell her the truth . Before he can respond , Ted ENTERS .
TUCKER: Well is n't this nicenow we 've got the whole gang together . Ted can hardly believe Dom is there .
TED: Dom ? What are you ?
DOM: You stole her from me . Now I want her back .

DOM: Dom Wooganowski . Duh .
TED: But but you 're married . You have kids a great wife .
DOM: If you 're so happy with them , please , be my guest .
HEALY: If I may I have a proposal . Everyone turns to Healy . HEALY I say none of us leave this room until ou young Mary here stops jerking us around and decides once and for all who she wants . Now Mary , I know this is difficult but you eally will be doing them all a favor to tell them the truth about us .
MARY: Are you crazy ? Why would I pick you ? You 're a murderer . Healy glares at Tucker .
TUCKER: Uh , wellnot exactly . You see , I exaggerated a little there .
MARY: You mean he 's not a criminal ?
HEALY: God no ! I 'm just a pathological liar ! Mary looks at Tucker , confused .
MARY: Tuckernot you , too ? Tucker lowers his head and reluctantly nods .
TUCKER: Name 's Norm . I live up in Pompano with my folks .

CHILDS: Am I starting to look Norwegian to you , Bwana ? Garry motions inquiringly to Norris .
NORRIS: Yeah . I caught that he wanted the etter part of my ass to come apart .
DR. COPPER: Do n't `` ouch '' me . Two stitches . It just grazed you . He helps a shaken Bennings up off the table .
BENNINGS: What in the hell were they doing ? Flying that low shooting at a dog at us
DR. COPPER: Stir crazy . Cabin fever Who knows .
CLARK: I 'll be here a while . Shell 's pretty deep .
SANCHEZ: It 's no go .
BLAIR: Well , get to somebody . Anybody . We 've got to report this mess .
SANCHEZ: Look , I have n't been able to reach shit in two weeks . Doubt if anybody 's talked to anybody on the whole continent .
NAULS: Maybe we at war with Norway .
PALMER: Was wondering when `` El Capitan '' was going to get a chance to use his pop gun .
GARRY: How long have they been stationed there ? Fuchs leafing through a pile of papers .
FUCHS: Says here about eight weeks .
GARRY: That 's not enough time for guys to go bonkers .
NAULS: Bullshit , Bwana , sweetheart . Five minutes is enough to put a man ove down here .
PALMER: Damn straight .
NAULS: I mean Palmer been the way he is since the first day . Palmer smiles and flips the cook the bird .
GARRY: How many in their party ?
FUCHS: Started with six . There 'd be fou others left .
DR. COPPER: How do you know ? The men 's attention turn to Copper .
GARRY: Nothing we can do about that .
DR. COPPER: Yes , there is . I 'd like to go up .
GARRY: In this weather ?
DR. COPPER: Bennings ?
BENNINGS: Winds are going to let up a tad , next couple of hours .
GARRY: A tad ?
BENNINGS: Ca n't condone it myself . But it is a short haul . Hour there , hour back .
PALMER: Shit , Doc , I 'll give you the lift if
GARRY: Forget it , Palmer . Doc , you 're a pain in the ass .
NORRIS: MacReady ai n't going nowhere . Bunkered in till spring .
GARRY: Just go get him .
NORRIS: Anyway , he 's probably ripped .
VOICE: Bishop to knight four .
MACREADY: Poor little son of a bitch . You 're starting to lose it , are n't you ?
VOICE: Pawn takes queen at knight four .
MACREADY: Cheating bastard
NORRIS: You jerking off or just pissed ?
MACREADY: We got any more of those electronic chess things down in supply ?
NORRIS: Get your gear on .
MACREADY: What for ?
GARRY: Quit the griping MacReady . Sooner you 're there sooner you 're ack .
MACREADY: It 's against regulations to go up this time of year !
DR. COPPER: Screw regulations ! Four guys could e crawling around on their bellies out there !
MACREADY: So , I do n't want to end up crawling around with them when we go down .
GARRY: Look , if you 're going to keep itching , MacReady Palmer 's offered to take him up
MACREADY: What are you talking ? ! He 's had two months training in those choppers !
PALMER: Four !
MACREADY: What is it out there , anyway ? Forty- five knots ?
BENNINGS: Sixteen .
MACREADY: And the horse you rode in on . Sixteen for how long ? ! You ca n't predict this time of year
CLARK: Mac 's really taking it up , huh ?
DR. COPPER: Anybody there ? !
MACREADY: Anybody in there ? ! Nothing .
DR. COPPER: We 're Americans ! Nothing .
MACREADY: Come to help you ! ! MacReady pushes against the door .
DR. COPPER: My God , what in hell happened here ?
MACREADY: Come on , Copper .
DR. COPPER: They 're not Swedish , goddamn it , they 're Norwegian , MacRe
MACREADY: Norwegian of the Month , Doc . Harmless . MacReady pockets it for further viewing .
DR. COPPER: Christ
MACREADY: Portable video unit .
DR. COPPER: All in Norwegian .
MACREADY: What are you doing ?
DR. COPPER: Could be important work . Might as well bring it back .
MACREADY: It 's getting late . Hurry it . I 'm going to check the last few rooms .
DR. COPPER: Watch it .
GARRY: Turn that crap down , Nauls . You can hear it all over the camp !
NAULS: Oui , Bwana . Can do .
SANCHEZ: Hey , man !
GARRY: You reach anybody yet ?
SANCHEZ: We 're a thousand miles from anybody else , man . It 's going to get a hell of a lot worse before it gets better .
GARRY: Well , stick to it .
MAN'S VOICE: Hello boy . A beat .
CHILDS: How my brothers and sister doing today ? Doin ' fine .
PALMER: Clark ! Will you kennel this goddamn dog ? Hey , Clark ? !
NORRIS: Seems they were spending a lot of time at a place four miles northeast of their camp .
GARRY: What were they involved in ?
MACREADY: Little ice core drilling some seismology glaciology same old shit we do .
BENNINGS: How much more of this crap is there ?
DR. COPPER: About nine more hours .
BENNINGS: We ca n't learn anything from this .
DR. COPPER: Probably right .
BENNINGS: What do you want from us ?
MACREADY: Just listen .
DR. COPPER: Goes on like that quite awhile . What do you gentlemen make of it ?
GARRY: Could be anything Men in isolation some beef that snowballed got out of hand
NORRIS: Maybe the whole camp got bent Something they ate . What about food poisoning , Doc ? Dr. Copper taps the tape deck pensively .
DR. COPPER: Maybe .
BENNINGS: Clark , will you put this mutt with the others where he belong ? !
DR. COPPER: Nothing wrong with this one . Physiologically , anyway . Find anything toxic ?
BLAIR: No drugs alcohol . Nothing .
DR. COPPER: I do n't understand .
BLAIR: It 's tissue from one of these sinewy ods . Fuchs is befuddled as he examines .
FUCHS: What in the world kind of cell structure is this ?
BLAIR: That 's the point .
DR. COPPER: I do n't get you , Blair .
BLAIR: I 'm not sure it is any kind of cell structure . Biologically speaking .
DR. COPPER: This really is n't my field , Blair . Let 's wrap for the day .
MACREADY: Decanite ? Thermite charges ?
CHILDS: Mac wants the what ? !
BENNINGS: That 's what he said . Now ! Move ! Bennings is off .
CLARK: Mac , where are you ?
GARRY: What 's going on , damn it ? MacReady aims his shotgun at the entire pack .
MACREADY: I 'm going to shoot .
CLARK: No ! Wait ! !
MACREADY: Clark ? Where are you ? Clark !
CHILDS: What 's happening ?
MACREADY: Torch it over there !
CHILDS: The dogs ?
MACREADY: Screw the dogs ! ! Torch it ! !
GARRY: We 're on fire !
MACREADY: Do n't let up , Childs !
GARRY: Extinguishers .
NAULS: It 's okay now , man . It 's dead . It 's over . You see . Clark turns to him with a childlike smile .
CLARK: I know . Mr. Childs killed it . I saw .
NAULS: Right , man . Right .
NORRIS: Here . This is where they were spending most of their time . Bennings pokes his head in the room .
BENNINGS: Pretty nasty out , Mac . Thirty-five knots .
MACREADY: Screw it , I 'm going up anyway .
BLAIR: Was that dog , the Norwegian dog ?
GARRY: I just ca n't comprehend any of this . It was just a dog .
CHILDS: `` twere n't no dog , Bwana .
BLAIR: That tape MacReady showed us this morning
GARRY: Could n't make much of it myself .
BLAIR: I 've asked him to try and locate the site . Okay with you ?
GARRY: Sure . You think there 's a connection ?
BLAIR: Maybe .
NORRIS: One of their sites would be directly over here .
PALMER: Wow
NORRIS: Magnesium of some type or some kind of strange alloy . And those poor dumb bastards had to go and blow the hell out of it .
MACREADY: So what do you make of it ?
NORRIS: You know damn well what we both make of it .
MACREADY: No chance it could have been some new kind of test craft ? Norris shakes his head no .
NORRIS: Seismic activity has been pushing this are up from way down for a long time This ice it was buried in It 's over a hundred thousand years old . Palmer calls out , waving them over .
CHILDS: Okay now , Mac , run this by me again . Thousands of years ago this rocket ship crashes , right ? And the MacReady is not listening .
MACREADY: Look , I 'm just guessing
CHILDS: Well , go on .
NAULS: Where 's that big ol ' steel pot of mine ? ! Damn !
MACREADY: So it crashes , and this guy , whoever he is , gets thrown out , o walks out , and ends up freezing .
CHILDS: I just ca n't believe this voodoo ullshit . You believe this voodoo ullshit , Blair ? Blair says nothing , lost in thought .
PALMER: Happens all the time , man . They 're falling out of the skies like flies . Government knows all about it Chariots of the Gods , man They practically own South America . I mean they taught the Incas everything they knew
CHILDS: Cool it , Palmer ! ! Palmer shakes a magazine at him adamantly .
PALMER: Read von Daniken ! Have you read von Daniken ? Get your facts straight ! Clark marvels at a particular photo .
CLARK: Jesus , why would those guys eve want to leave Norway ?
NAULS: Which one you muthers been tossing his dirty underwear in the kitchen trash ? !
CHILDS: So , MacReady , come on now . These Norwegian dudes come by find him and dig him up
MACREADY: Yeah , they dig him up and cart him ack . He gets thawed out , wakes up and scares the shit out of them . And they get into one hell of a brawl
CHILDS: Now how 's this motherfucker wake up after thousands of years in the ice , huh ?
MACREADY: I do n't know how . Because he 's different than we are . Because he 's a space guy . What do you want from me , anyway . Go ask Blair .
CHILDS: You buy any of this , Blair ?
BLAIR: It was here got to that dog It was here in this camp The men take in his grave countenance .
GARRY: So ? So what ? It 's over with .
BENNINGS: Well , is n't it ?
BLAIR: Whatever that Norwegian dog was It It was capable of changing its form when it attacked our dog it somehow was able to digest or absorb it and in the process shaped its own cells to imitate our dog 's cells exactly This for instance is n't dog at all it 's imitation We got to it before it had time to finish or
NAULS: Finish what ?
BLAIR: I think the whole process would have taken an hour maybe more . And then I suppose both would have changed back to dog form .
PALMER: Well , that Thing in the ice sure were n't no dog .
BLAIR: Of course not But whatever it was evived , it Well , The Thing was probably disoriented and realized it could n't survive for long in ou atmosphere But being the incredibly adaptable creature it was it tried to become something that could Before the Norwegians killed it it somehow got to this dog .
CLARK: What do you mean `` got '' to the dog ?
BLAIR: It was a life form that was able to imitate and reproduce , whatever it ate or absorbed , cell for cell . Silence .
CHILDS: You 're saying that big muther in the ice , became the dog .
BLAIR: I think we 're talking about an organism that could imitate othe life forms perfectly It could have gone on and on It could have ecome one dog It could have become as many dogs as it wanted to and without losing any of its original mass
NORRIS: You been into Childs ' weed , Blair ? Blair slams his fist on the slab .
BLAIR: Look , I know it 's hard to believe
GARRY: So what 's our problem ?
BLAIR: Well there 's still some cell activity it 's not entirely dead yet .
MACREADY: And the horse you rode in on , Fuchs . Light it up .
FUCHS: Well , I 'm not going to let this happen
MACREADY: Fuck history . At least we 're going to live to be an old bunch of assholes .
BLAIR: Clark , did you notice anything strange about that dog ? Just anything at all ? Any little thing ?
CLARK: No . Just that he recovered real quick That night when I found him in the rec room , he had already scraped off his bandage . Before I put him with the others , I redressed his wound and noticed it had healed up real good A beat as Blair stares at Clark .
BLAIR: That night ?
CLARK: Yeah .
BLAIR: What was he doing in the rec room ?
CLARK: Well , after I worked on him thought I 'd let him rest . Left the room fo a bit . When I came back , he was gone .
BLAIR: Well , where was he ? Where did he go ?
CLARK: Do n't know . Looked for him for a it could n't find him .
BLAIR: You 're saying he was n't put into the kennel until the night ?
CLARK: Well yeah . Blair stands , his eyes still glued to Clark .
BLAIR: How long were you with the dog ? Alone , I mean ?
CLARK: Ah He was hurt bad . Bullet nicked an artery I do n't know An hour hour and a half Blair 's eyes glaze as if in revelation .
BLAIR: Nothing . Nothing at all . He backs out of the kennel .
GARRY: Anybody sick ?
BLAIR: No , I I do n't mean infection or disease
GARRY: Any luck yet ? Sanchez shrugs .
SANCHEZ: Couple seconds of an Argentine disco station .
GARRY: Well , stick with it . I want you at it round the clock . We got to get help in here
BLAIR: No No , you ca n't let anyone in here That dog was all over this camp
BENNINGS: Travel-wise , tomorrow may be okay . But after that some pretty nasty northeasterly shit 's coming in .
FUCHS: Goddamn fools
BLAIR: Listen to me , Garry . Please
GARRY: If the weather clears enough before we reach anybody I 'm sending you and Doc up to MacMurdo
BLAIR: No ! You ca n't let people leave
MACREADY: I ai n't going anywhere in anything over forty knots , Garry
GARRY: The hell you wo n't , MacReady !
BLAIR: Do n't you understand ? ! That Thing did n't want to become a dog
GARRY: Damn you , Blair ! You 've already got everybody half-hysterical around here .
BLAIR: You ca n't let anybody leave !
GARRY: I 've got six dead Norwegians on my hands , a burned up flying saucer , and we 've just destroyed the scientific find of the century . Now fuck off !
MACREADY: All set .
CHESS VOICE: Rook takes bishop at Queen four Rook take pawn at Queen two Rook takes Queen at Queen one Checkmate .
MACREADY: Aw shit .
MACREADY: What 's
PALMER: Blair . He 's gone berserk .
BENNINGS: He 's in the radio room . Got a gun . Beat on Sanchez something fierce .
BLAIR: Anybody interferes , I 'll kill ! Nobody 's getting in or out of this camp
MACREADY: He smashed one of the choppers up good . Childs , go check the other one and the tractor . Childs is off .
BLAIR: You think I 'm crazy ? Fine ! Most of you do n't know what 's going on ut I 'm damn well sure some of you do !
NORRIS: The back window . A couple of us could maybe surprise him .
MACREADY: Too damn dangerous .
BLAIR: You think this Thing wants to ecome an animal ? Dogs ca n't make it 1000 miles to the sea . No skua gulls to imitate this time of year No penguins this far inland Do n't you understand ? ! It wanted to become us ! He brings the ax down hard on the radio .
CHILDS: He got both choppers and the tractor I do n't know how bad yet . Garry readies his large .357 Magnum .
MACREADY: No , wait a minute . The fuse box . Norris double-times down the hall .
BLAIR: Ca n't you see ? If one cell of this Thing got out it could imitate every living thing on Earth . Nothing could stop it ! Nothing !
MACREADY: Look Blair , maybe you 're right about this . But we 've got to be rational . We 've got to talk this over . I 'm unarmed and I 'm coming in .
BLAIR: No , you 're not ! I do n't trust any of you !
MACREADY: If you 're right we 've all got to stick together .
BLAIR: Why am I here ?
DR. COPPER: It 's for your own protection , Blair .
MACREADY: And mainly ours .
BLAIR: I do n't know who to trust .
MACREADY: Know what you mean , Blair . Trust is a tough thing to come by these days . Just trust in the Lord .
BLAIR: Watch Clark .
MACREADY: What ?
BLAIR: Watch him close . Ask him why he did n't kennel the dog . Blair 's face disappears from the window .
SANCHEZ: I 'll see what I can do . But they did n't teach me much about fixing these things . Norris smiles and pats him comfortingly .
NORRIS: They did n't teach you much about working them either .
DR. COPPER: Put this in Blair 's juice before you take him his tray .
CLARK: The dogs
GARRY: Does n't look broken .
CLARK: No . Door was wide open . I know I latched it .
DR. COPPER: How long do you suppose they 've been gone ?
CLARK: I have n't seen them since their last feeding . Could be as much as twenty- four hours .
MACREADY: They could n't have gotten that fa in this weather .
GARRY: You 're not thinking of going afte them , are you ?
MACREADY: I am going after them .
NORRIS: What in the hell for ? Even if Blair 's ight they 'll just die out there . No food . They 're over a thousand miles from anything .
PALMER: Chopper are n't going to be ready fo days . MacReady hands his list to Bennings .
MACREADY: Get these things out of supply and meet me over by the snowmobiles .
GARRY: You 're not going to catch them in one of those with the start they got .
MACREADY: Palmer , how long would it take you to strap those big four-cylinde carburetors on ?
PALMER: Oh , I got you . Not too long .
MACREADY: Then get a move on . Childs , come with me .
GARRY: Besides , what are you going to do when you catch up to them ? Bennings is reading MacReady 's list .
BENNINGS: Holy shit . Whatever he 's going to do , he ai n't fucking around .
CHILDS: I can get maybe another five or six feet out of it .
MACREADY: That 's good enough .
BENNINGS: All right Box of dynamite box of thermite three shotguns box of flares two flare guns thirty cans gasoline and a case of alcohol .
MACREADY: Let 's load 'em .
CHILDS: What is it ?
MACREADY: Maybe dinner .
BENNINGS: Dogs do n't eat each other .
MACREADY: I know .
CHILDS: Where 's the other half ?
MACREADY: Probably the next meal .
BENNINGS: Nowhere Just straight to the ocean .
MACREADY: Let 's move .
CHILDS: They could be hours ahead of us , Mac .
BENNINGS: Gon na get dark soon , too . Supposed to be fifty below tonight . MacReady gets on and revs up the engine .
MACREADY: Turn back if you want . Childs and Bennings return shrugs .
CHILDS: Where 's the other one ?
MACREADY: Where 's your buddy , boy ? Huh ?
MACREADY: Stay back ! !
CHILDS: What we going to do ? !
MACREADY: How the fuck do I know ? !
CHILDS: But
MACREADY: He 's gone already ! Do it !
CLARK: I 'm telling you I do n't remembe leaving the kennel unlatched
CHILDS: Bullshit ! You left it open so they could get out !
CLARK: Would I even have told you they were gone if I had anything to hide ?
GARRY: But why did n't you kennel that dog ight away ?
CLARK: I told you I could n't find get that out of my face .
CHILDS: Do n't you be telling me Nauls steps between them .
NAULS: Lighten your load , sucker . You ai n't the judge and executioner around here !
CHILDS: Who you trying to protect , mutherfucker ? I 'm telling you this S.O.B . could be one of them .
GARRY: Hold on , damn it . We 're getting nowhere If this bit of Blair 's about absorbing and imitating is true then that dog could have gotten to anybody .
DR. COPPER: And if it got to Clark Clark could have gotten to anybody . MacReady moves over to the table .
NORRIS: It 's just too damn wild I ca n't elieve it .
MACREADY: Well , you can believe it now .
CLARK: So what ?
NORRIS: I wear a size large , too .
MACREADY: So do I . So do most of us . The uneasiness in the room grows .
SANCHEZ: Well , what we going to do ? Norris turns to Dr. Copper and Fuchs .
NORRIS: Can there be some kind of test ? To find out who 's what ?
DR. COPPER: A serum test possibly .
FUCHS: Right . Why not ?
GARRY: What 's that ?
DR. COPPER: It 's a simple blood typing test . This Thing 's blood chemistry is different than ours . Basically we mix someone 's blood with uncontaminated human blood . If we do n't get the proper serum reaction then that person is n't human .
CHILDS: Whose uncontaminated blood we going to use ?
DR. COPPER: We 've got blood plasma in storage .
GARRY: How long will it take you to prepare this ?
DR. COPPER: A couple of hours .
GARRY: Well , get to it .
PALMER: How 's that Thing get to the dogs ? I though we stopped it in time .
MACREADY: Copper thinks they swallowed pieces of it during the fight .
PALMER: And that was enough ?
DR. COPPER: Somebody got to the blood sabotaged it .
NAULS: Oh , my God . A horrified silence .
MACREADY: Was it broken into ?
FUCHS: No . Somebody opened it . Closed it . And then locked it . Sanchez twitches , terrified .
MACREADY: Well , who 's got access to it ?
DR. COPPER: I guess I 'm the only one .
GARRY: And I 've got the only key . Several pairs of eyes turn to Garry .
MACREADY: Would that test have worked ?
DR. COPPER: I think so .
NORRIS: Somebody else sure as hell thought so .
MACREADY: Who else could have used that key ?
GARRY: Ah no one I give it to Coppe when he needs it
MACREADY: Could anyone have gotten it from you ?
DR. COPPER: I do n't see how when I 'm finished I return it right away .
NORRIS: When was the last time you used it ?
DR. COPPER: A day or so ago I guess .
GARRY: I suppose well , it 's possible someone might have lifted it from me . But
CHILDS: That key ring of yours is always hooked to your belt . Now how could somebody get to it without you knowing ?
GARRY: Look , I have n't been near that that refrigerator .
DR. COPPER: Now wait a second , Garry , you 've een in here on several occasions
FUCHS: And the Doc thought of the test .
CHILDS: So what ? ! Is that supposed to leave him in the clear ? ! Bullshit !
GARRY: Hey , Sanchez !
GARRY: Put that down !
SANCHEZ: No .
GARRY: I 'll put this right through you head . No one doubts Garry 's sincerity .
SANCHEZ: You guys going to let him give orders ? I mean he could be one of those Things .
MACREADY: Put it away , Sanchez . Just put it away .
GARRY: I do n't know about Copper . But I did n't go near that plasma But I guess you 'll all rest easie if someone else is in charge . He hands his gun to Norris .
NORRIS: Sorry , gentlemen Do n't think I 'd be up to it . Have n't been feeling well lately . Childs goes for the gun .
CHILDS: I 'll take it MacReady beats him to it .
MACREADY: Maybe it should be someone a bit more even-tempered , Childs . Childs glares .
CHILDS: What do we do about those three ?
MACREADY: We got morphine , do n't we . Fuchs nods .
PALMER: Morphine ? You know I was pretty close to that dog , too . Palmer is ignored .
NORRIS: We should sleep in shifts .
MACREADY: Right . Half of us awake at all times .
SANCHEZ: How we going to try and find out who 's you know , who 's who ?
MACREADY: Can you think of any other tests ?
FUCHS: I 'll try . I could sure use Copper 's help though .
CHILDS: You can eighty-six that thought right now , man . Dr. Copper eyes his accuser solemnly .
MACREADY: Also When this Thing turns it turns slowly at first . I think we can handle it in that state . But if it ever got to full power from what I saw of that Norwegian camp well , I just do n't know It would probably take it an hour or more to get like that . So no matter what anybody 's doing , we all return to this room every twenty minutes . Anybody gone longer than that anybody trying to leave we kill 'em .
PALMER: Where 's that magneto ? Ca n't find a darn thing around here any more .
DR. COPPER: I 'll do it . You 're going to break the needle in my arm .
CHILDS: No , Doc . He 's doing a real fine job .
MACREADY: Look for shoes , too . And burned cloth .
NAULS: That thing 's too smart to be hiding any more of its clothes , MacReady .
MACREADY: Just keep looking .
FUCHS: Nothing yet . But , MacReady , I 've een thinking If our dogs changed y swallowing parts of that othe one We better see to it that everyone prepares their own food and we eat out of cans .
MACREADY: Gotchya .
PALMER: Childs , where 's that magneto from Chopper One ?
CHILDS: Ai n't it there ? He passes by .
PALMER: No it ai n't there . Would I be asking if it were there ?
MACREADY: Move it , Palmer .
MACREADY: Start taking apart those snowmobiles next , huh ?
NAULS: I got your goodies , superdude .
BLAIR: Nobody 's getting in here . You can tell them all that !
NAULS: Well , who the hell you think wants to get in there with you ?
BLAIR: And I do n't want any more food with sedatives in it . I know what you 're up to . Do n't think I do n't . And if anyone tries to get in here I 've got rope . I 'll hang myself before it gets to me .
NAULS: You promise ? Nauls picks up the tray , heads back mumbling .
CLARK: Got ta go to the can , Childs .
CHILDS: Be quick .
NAULS: Somebody 's taken it . I ca n't find it !
MACREADY: What 's happened ? !
PALMER: The fuel pump it 's gone You 've got to get up to supply , Mca . If we do n't get this thing started soon , it 'll freeze on us and we 'll never get it going . MacReady dashes upstairs into the darkness .
MACREADY: Who Who is that ? The silhouette moves on down the hallway .
PALMER: Somebody definitely messed with it .
MACREADY: We going to make it ?
PALMER: Hope so . Another ten , fifteen minutes . What I do n't get is
SANCHEZ: Where were the flashlights ?
MACREADY: Screw the flashlights . Where the hell were you ?
PALMER: Tons of stuff 's been missing around here . Magnetos , cables , wire
NAULS: Kitchen things , too
MACREADY: Anybody see Fuchs or hear him ? Huh ?
CHILDS: Where 'd you go ? Garry 's groggy features stare blankly .
GARRY: Was dark find a light
CHILDS: You lying bastard Garry struggles to his feet , affronted .
GARRY: I rather do n't like your tone He grabs Childs by the collar .
CHILDS: You sit back down
NORRIS: Enough MacReady , furious , pulls Childs away .
MACREADY: That storm 's going to start ripping any minute so we do n't have much time .
SANCHEZ: Why ?
MACREADY: If he 's one of those Things , we 've got to get to him before he changes Nauls , you and Childs and I 'll check the outside shacks He tosses torches to Sanchez and Palmer .
PALMER: I ai n't going with Sanchez .
SANCHEZ: Well , screw you , man !
PALMER: I ai n't going with you !
CHILDS: Well , who says I want you going with me ? !
MACREADY: Cut the bullshit Okay , Sanchez , you come with us . Norris you stay here Any of them move you fry 'em . And if you hear anything , anything at all you let loose the siren . We all meet back here in twenty minutes egardless . And everybody watch whoever you 're with . Real close . The men survey each other .
PALMER: What 'd we ever do to these Things anyway
CHILDS: Do n't walk behind me . Another beat .
PALMER: Right .
MACREADY: Hey , Blair ! ! Blair jumps in fear , spilling his can .
BLAIR: I 've changed my mind I 'd I 'd like to come back inside I do n't want to stay out here any more Funny things I hear funny things out here .
MACREADY: Have you come across Fuchs ?
BLAIR: Fuchs ? No , it 's not Fuchs You must let me back in I wo n't harm anyone I promise
MACREADY: We 'll see
BLAIR: I promise ! I 'm much better now ! I 'll e good ! ! I 'm all better ! ! Do n't leave me here ! !
DR. COPPER: I 'm getting worried about you . You ought to have a checkup .
NORRIS: Let 's just not get worried about anything just now .
DR. COPPER: After all this mess then .
NORRIS: After all this mess .
PALMER: Auxiliary light cables ? Been cut .
CHILDS: Cut , bullshit . Been pulled apart .
NAULS: Where 's the roof ? !
MACREADY: Could n't be possible . Must have weighted a ton and a half
NAULS: Goddamn white women .
CHILDS: My babies .
PALMER: Somebody broke in .
CHILDS: Now who 'd go and do
PALMER: Childs ! !
CHILDS: Let go of me
PALMER: Do n't get near 'em . The plants ! They 're alive . Those things can imitate anything
CHILDS: What 's it going to do , being a plant ? Palmer readies his small torch .
PALMER: We got to burn 'em .
CHILDS: Now hold on , you dumb
SANCHEZ: Whoever put this through him
CHILDS: No one 's that strong , boy !
PALMER: Why did n't it imitate Fuchs ? Is n't that its number to get more ecruits .
CHILDS: Was n't enough time . Generator was out , what ? Thirty minutes . Takes the bastards an hour , maybe two to absorb somebody .
SANCHEZ: Why Fuchs ?
CHILDS: He was working on a test . Fuchs must have been onto something . These astards got scared and got rid of him . Hey Where 's
PALMER: MacReady ! !
CHILDS: Nauls ! ! MacReady ! !
NORRIS: Forty Forty-five minutes .
CHILDS: We better start closing off the outside hatchways .
PALMER: Where 's MacReady ?
NAULS: Cut him loose of the line up by his shack .
CHILDS: Cut him loose ?
NAULS: When we were up poking around his place I found this
SANCHEZ: MacReady ?
NAULS: He 's one of them .
SANCHEZ: When do you think it got to him ?
PALMER: Could have been anytime . Anywhere .
CHILDS: If it did get to him .
NAULS: Look , man
PALMER: When the lights went out
NORRIS: Would have been a perfect time
PALMER: Right . Garry was missing And Sanchez
SANCHEZ: Fuck you , Palmer . Childs and Norris separate them .
NORRIS: This is just what it wants to pit us against each other .
NAULS: Bullshit ! He 's got to know damn well I cut it ! The men keep their voices low .
PALMER: Let 's open it .
CHILDS: Hell no . More pounding .
SANCHEZ: You think he 's changed into one of those Things ?
NORRIS: He has n't had enough time .
CHILDS: Nothing human could have made it ack here in this weather without a guideline
PALMER: Let 's open it . Now
CHILDS: Why you so damn anxious to let him in here
PALMER: He 's so close . Maybe our best chance to blow him away .
CHILDS: No . Just let him freeze out there .
SANCHEZ: What if we 're wrong about him ?
CHILDS: Then we 're wrong .
PALMER: The supply window !
SANCHEZ: What we going to
NORRIS: All right all right we 've got no choice now
MACREADY: What 's going on out there ?
CHILDS: Damn it , he 's got the keys .
MACREADY: What are you doing ?
CHILDS: Move in slow now .
MACREADY: Anyone messes with me the whole camp goes .
MACREADY: back way off .
NAULS: It 's cool , man . We ai n't near you , man Stay cool
PALMER: Yeah , man , really . Just relax .
MACREADY: Anybody touches me we go .
NAULS: I do n't think he 's breathing .
MACREADY: Go untie the Doc . Get him in here . Bring the others , too From now on no one gets out of my sight .
CHILDS: We ai n't buying that .
DR. COPPER: Damn it , quit the bickering and give me a hand . Wheel that fibrillato over here .
CHILDS: You 're going to have to sleep sometime .
DR. COPPER: Quiet down turn that thing on . Sanchez depresses the `` on '' button .
MACREADY: I 'm a real light sleeper , Childs
DR. COPPER: Enough , MacReady !
MACREADY: And if anyone tries to wake me
DR. COPPER: Damn you , MacReady !
SANCHEZ: God what ?
MACREADY: Get out of the way ! !
CLARK: What you got in mind , MacReady ?
MACREADY: A little test .
PALMER: What kind of test ?
MACREADY: I 'm sure a lot of you already know .
CHILDS: What for ?
MACREADY: For your health .
GARRY: Let 's rush him . He 's not going to low us all up .
MACREADY: Damn if I wo n't .
CHILDS: You ai n't tying me up .
MACREADY: Then I 'll have to kill you .
CHILDS: Then kill me . MacReady points the .44 at Childs ' head .
MACREADY: I mean it .
CHILDS: I guess you do .
MACREADY: Tie up Clark , too .
PALMER: He 's dead .
MACREADY: Norris looked pretty dead , himself . Bullets do n't kill these Things .
CHILDS: We should have jumped his ass .
MACREADY: Now Copper , you tie Palmer up .
NAULS: What are you going to do ? Drink it ?
MACREADY: Watching Norris in there gave me the idea that maybe every part of you bastards is a whole . Every piece of you is self-sufficient , an animal unto itself . When a man bleeds it 's just tissue . But blood from one of you Things wo n't obey . It 's a newly formed individual with a built-in desire to protect its own life . When attacked , your blood will try and survive and crawl away from a hot needle say .
MACREADY: Now you .
DR. COPPER: Thank you .
MACREADY: I did n't think you 'd use that fibrillator on Norris if you were one of them . He hands Copper the torch .
CHILDS: Load of bullshit .
MACREADY: We 'll see . Let 's try Clark .
CHILDS: So Clark was human , huh ? MacReady nods .
MACREADY: Palmer now .
GARRY: Pure nonsense . This wo n't prove a damn thing .
MACREADY: Thought you 'd feel that way , Garry . You were the only one who could have gotten to that blood plasma we 'll do you last
CHILDS: Get me get me the hell away from cut me loose , damn it !
NAULS: Shut the damn hell up .
MACREADY: Blair
NAULS: What is it ?
MACREADY: Everything that 's been missing .
CHILDS: Spaceship of some kind .
MACREADY: Smart S.O.B . He put it together piece y piece .
NAULS: Where was he trying to go ?
MACREADY: Anyplace but here .
NAULS: What about Childs ?
MACREADY: Forget about Childs . He 's over .
GARRY: Make 'em short . They 'll go off quicke if we need to use them .
SANCHEZ: What if it does n't come ?
MACREADY: It 'll come . It needs us . We 're the only thing left to imitate Give me a hand .
NAULS: You crazy ? He might be inside already ?
MACREADY: Chance we got to take . We got to force him to come down the east side to the door we got rigged . Nauls starts lacing his skates .
SANCHEZ: He might just wait us out .
MACREADY: I 'm going to blow the generator when you get back . He 'll have to come fo us or freeze .
GARRY: One thousand volts . Should be enough .
SANCHEZ: You hear that ?
NAULS: Hear what ?
SANCHEZ: What ? !
NAULS: It 's in between us and them ! ! How we going to get back ? !
SANCHEZ: I ca n't hear you .
MACREADY: What are they doing out there ? !
GARRY: What 's he saying ?
NAULS: MacReady ! We been cut off ! !
MACREADY: Got to get to the generator .
NAULS: Get back ! !
MACREADY: The generator !
NAULS: Screw the generator ! !
MACREADY: Calm down and get in your position .
NAULS: Position , my ass Garry fiddles with the two generators .
GARRY: I 'm going to bump this up , much as I can .
NAULS: Boulder Dam might do it .
GARRY: How long 's it been ?
MACREADY: Little over two hours .
NAULS: Maybe it ai n't coming .
MACREADY: Then we go after him .
NAULS: Bet the last place you ever go .
MACREADY: Wait
CHILDS: Did you kill it ? He looks as weak as MacReady . A beat .
MACREADY: I think so .
CHILDS: What do you mean `` you think so ? ''
MACREADY: Yeah . I got it . Pretty mean frostbite .
CHILDS: It 'll turn black again soon enough . Then I guess I 'll be losing the whole thing Think my toes are already gone .
MACREADY: Not the only one .
CHILDS: The fire 's got the temperature way up all over camp wo n't last long though .
MACREADY: Neither will we .
CHILDS: Maybe we should try and fix the adio try and get some help .
MACREADY: Maybe we should n't .
CHILDS: Then we 'll never make it .
MACREADY: Maybe we should n't make it .
CHILDS: If you 're worried about anything , let 's take that blood test of yours .
MACREADY: If we 've got any surprises for each other we should n't be in any condition to do anything about it . You play chess ?
CHILDS: I guess I 'll be learning .
THE END: < /pre
MELVIN: Here 's what I 'm going to do , son . I 'll give it to you straight . I 'm not going to fill your head with stories about fictitious characters like Santa Claus or the Easter Bunny or God . There 's only one thing you need to worry about in this life and that 's women . And I 'm going to teach you everything I know about the art of meeting , courting and seducing 'em . Do n't worry about anything else , there 's nothing more important . Reading , writing , toilet training you can learn later in life .
MARY: Molly loves her flowers . Thank you . Melvin 's attitude changes immediately .
MELVIN: Oh . No problem . They were my idea .
MARY: Well it was a very nice gesture . She continues walking , then stops .
MELVIN: Absolutely . We 'll see you there .
MARY: They seem to like each other .
MELVIN: They certainly do .
MARY: Molly has a birthday party coming up . Would you like to come ?
MELVIN: Absolutely .
MARY: I 'm thinking about a sleepover ? Or is it too soon ?
MELVIN: A `` sleepover '' would be great . No such thing as `` too soon '' when you 're with the right person .
MARY: What are you doing ? !
MELVIN: Getting to know you . Before the `` sleepover '' .
MARY: I meant Mike coming over to spend the night . Not his Dad .
MELVIN: Oh .
KENNY: Hi , hon .
HELEN: Do n't forget , Mrs. Higgins wants to talk to you this afternoon about Kevin . You need to do something about this .
KENNY: Kids are supposed to get detention .
KEVIN: Dean Rusk !
KENNY: Wrong , and you get to wax my car . KENNY JR. smirk at Kevin .
HELEN: Got time for pancakes ?
KENNY: Nope . Attorney General ? A PHONE RINGS as the kids cry out en masse .
KIDS: Too easy ! Bobby , Bobby Kennedy !
KENNY: All right , wise guys , Assistant Secretary of State for Latin America
THE PRESIDENT: Morning , Kenny . You see this goddamn Capehart stuff ?
KENNY: Bayh 's going to lose , but it 's good groundwork for us for '64 .
THE PRESIDENT: I was eating that .
KENNY: No you were n't .
THE PRESIDENT: I was , you bastard . Kenny takes a defiant bite .
KENNY: Today , for your information , is Pulaski Day . We 're going to Buffalo
POL #1: We 're putting up Potowski next time . Will you guys come out for him ?
KENNY: Who else you got ?
POL #2: There 's Richardson . Good kid .
KENNY: Got the touch ?
POL #2: Yeah . Still moldable , too .
KENNY: Everyone likes a good kid
CROWD: MR. PRESIDENT ! PRESIDENT KENNEDY !
RESTON: How 's my favorite President ?
KENNY: Busy . But you 've got his heart .
RESTON: I want an hour with him .
KENNY: I said his heart , not his attention .
RESTON: Three weeks before midterm elections ? You need me .
KENNY: Well . There is a new civil rights initiative he wants to talk about .
RESTON: I 'm doing a piece on Skybolt . I hea Macmillan 's meeting with him in Nassau .
KENNY: We 're giving the Brits Polaris instead . But a story 'll just aggravate things .
RESTON: Pretending there is n't a problem wo n't fix it . He can clear the air on Anglo American relations .
KENNY: Forget it , Scotty .
RESTON: Let him talk to me , he makes Macmillan look good , I print it , the British public likes it , Macmillan owes you .
KENNY: All right , you 're in . Half hour .
BUNDY: No , Ken . I need to see him now
KENNY: Morning , Floyd .
BUNDY: Cuba . Bundy is tense . But Kenny relaxes .
KENNY: Just Cuba ? Okay , I got work to do , see you guys downstairs .
THE PRESIDENT: I think you should come in here . Kenny starts for the door .
KENNY: Not as far as the election goes . The President lets Kenny by into
THE PRESIDENT: You used to look down a bomb sight for a living , Ken . What do you see ?
KENNY: We hit a Nazi buzz bomb field in '45 . It looks like a rocket base
BUNDY: On Sunday morning , one of our U-2s took these pictures . The Soviets are putting medium range ballistic missiles into Cuba .
LUNDAHL: They appear to be the SS-4 range of a thousand miles , three-megaton nuclea warhead .
KENNY: Jesus Christ in Heaven
VARIOUS OPERATORS: Please hold for the White HouseMr . O'Donnell for Secretary McNamara White House Operator please hold
KENNY: The principals are assembling in an hour . See you then .
THE PRESIDENT: Where 's Bobby ? Kenny nods , acknowledging the feeling
KENNY: Should be here any minute .
THE PRESIDENT: Good .
BOBBY: Jesus Christ , guys . What the hell 's Khruschev thinking ?
THE PRESIDENT: Did you have any indication of this from Georgi ? Any possible warning or sense of motivation ?
BOBBY: Complete snowjob . And then we went out and told the country they were n't putting missiles into Cuba . By the way , you realize we just lost the midterms .
KENNY: Who gives a shit about the midterms now ? The Soviets are putting nuclear weapons ninety miles away from us .
BOBBY: You mean there 's something more important than votes ? Did n't think I 'd live to see the day , Ken . The President paces away , grim .
KENNY: Jesus . I feel like we 've caught the Jap carriers steaming for Pearl Harbor .
GROUP: Good morning , Mr. President .
THE PRESIDENT: Good morning , gentlemen .
RUSK: Mr. President .
THE PRESIDENT: Bob . Bet you had a late night .
MCNAMARA: Sleep is for the weak , Mr. President .
KENNY: Lyndon . Adlai .
THE PRESIDENT: Max .
GENERAL TAYLOR: McCone 's been notified and is coming ack from the West coast . Carter 's here , though .
KENNY: Ted .
SORENSEN: Kenny .
THE PRESIDENT: Okay . Let 's have it .
GENERAL CARTER: Arthur Lundahl heads our photographic interpretation division at CIA . I 'll let him and his boys take you through what we 've got . Arthur ?
LUNDAHL: Gentlemen , as most of you now know a U-2 over Cuba on Sunday morning took a series of disturbing photographs .
GENERAL CARTER: Five minutes , gentlemen . Five minutes .
GENERAL TAYLOR: In those five minutes they could kill 80 million Americans and destroy a significant number of our bomber bases , degrading our retaliatory options . The Joint Chiefs ' consensus is that this is a massively destabilizing move , upsetting the nuclear balance .
THE PRESIDENT: Arthur . Are . You . Sure ?
LUNDAHL: Yes , Mr. President . These are nuclea missiles .
BOBBY: How long until they 're operational ?
LUNDAHL: General Taylor can answer that question etter than I can .
GENERAL TAYLOR: I have to stress that there may be more missiles that we do n't know about . We need more U-2 coverage .
THE PRESIDENT: Is there any indication - anything at all - that suggests they intend to use these missiles in some sort of first strike ?
GENERAL CARTER: Not at present , sir . But I think the prudent answer is we do n't know .
THE PRESIDENT: Do we have any sort of intelligence from CIA on what Khruschev is thinking ?
GENERAL CARTER: No , Mr. President . We do n't . We just do n't know what 's happening inside the Kremlin at that level .
BOBBY: They lied to us . Two weeks ago Dobrynin told me to my face Khurschev had no intention of putting missiles into Cuba . They said themselves , this is ou ackyard .
THE PRESIDENT: Gentlemen , I want first reactions . Assuming for a moment Khruschev has not gone off the deep end and intends to start World War Three , what are we looking at ?
RUSK: Mr. President , I believe my team is in agreement . If we permit the introduction of nuclear missiles to a Soviet satellite nation in ou hemisphere , the diplomatic consequences will be too terrible to contemplate . The Russians are trying to show the world they can do whatever they want , wherever they want , and we 're powerless to stop them . If they succeed
BOBBY: It will be Munich all over again .
RUSK: Appeasement only makes the aggresso more aggressive . Confidence in ou security commitments around the world will falter , allies will become unsure in the face of Soviet pressure , and the Soviets will be emboldened to push us even harder . We must remove the missiles one way or another . It seems to me the options are either to build up the crisis 'til they give in , or we hit them . An air strike .
THE PRESIDENT: Bob ?
MCNAMARA: We 've worked up several military scenarios . Before I ask General Taylo to lead us through the various options , I 'd like for us to adopt a rule . If we are going to strike , we must agree now that we will do it before the missiles become operational . Because once they are , I do n't think we can guarantee getting them all before at least some are launched . And there it is . The clock is running .
BUNDY: Sir . We need to consider if we decide to act , there 's a good chance we 'll end up in a general war .
THE PRESIDENT: It 's clear we can not permit Soviet nuclear missiles in Cuba . We must get those missiles out .
KENNY: If we hit 'em , kill a lot of Russians , they 'll move against Berlin . They attack Berlin , that 's NATO and we 're at war .
BOBBY: Damned if we do , but if we do n't , we 're in a war for sure somewhere else in six months . Pained , the President turns away .
THE PRESIDENT: No choice . This is going to cost lives any way we go . Do nothing , and it could e 80 million of ours . We have to get id of those missiles .
KENNY: There 've got to be alternatives to just going out and bombing them .
BOBBY: He 's right , Jack . Taylor is saying we may have some time . We 've got to use it .
THE PRESIDENT: So if there are alternatives that make sense - and I 'm not saying there are - we need 'em . Need 'em fast .
BOBBY: What about the allies ? Congress ? I think we may need to start letting key people know . And they 're all scattered across the country for the campaign . We 're going to need to get the U.N. staff in and warmed up . Jesus I do n't even know if we 've got secure communications with half our embassies since that the Soviets got that cryptographer of ours .
THE PRESIDENT: We ca n't worry about everything right now . We 've got to figure out what we 're going to do before we worry about how we do it .
KENNY: The other thing is
BOBBY: I know . CIA and the military fucked us on the Bay of Pigs .
KENNY: They 're going to be pressing for a military solution soon . We ca n't afford to let them ram their agenda down ou throats . We need to come with options other than air strikes so we have some sort of choice here .
BOBBY: We got a bunch of smart guys . We lock 'em up together in there , kick 'em in the ass til they come up with options .
KENNY: It 's too politicized with you in there , anyway . They need to be able to stick their necks out .
BOBBY: It 'll be the principals , a couple of the key guys from each department the Executive Committee of the National Security Council . We 'll call it EXCOM .
KENNY: EXCOM . Has a ring to it . Like F-Troop .
THE PRESIDENT: Okay . Kenny and I only show for the meetings you call us into . Impress us . And do it fast . You 're in charge of keeping this quiet . If word gets out before we know what we 're going to do , there 'll be panic . And it 'll ruin any chance of surprise if we decide to hit them .
KENNY: Then we need to do a few things right away . No Pierre . He knows , the press knows . You 're going to have to keep up you schedule - your movements are followed too closely . And we need to get these guys out of the White House . George Ball 's got a conference room at State . Reconvene over there this afternoon , come back here tonight . Bobby nods .
BOBBY: I think we should bring in Dean Acheson . He was fighting Soviets while we were still working the wards in Boston .
THE PRESIDENT: Find him , Kenny . We 're going to need all the help we can get .
RESTON: Hey , Kenny ! Who died ?
KENNY: Way it 's going , the Democratic Party . DNC strategy session . If you can call it that .
ASSISTANT: Sir ? Kenny tries to look him away .
RESTON: It 's Tuesday . You said to call . When do I get my 45 minutes ?
KENNY: Tell you what . We 're in Connecticut tomorrow for Ribicoff . I 'll get you up front with him during the flight .
RESTON: Deal .
ASSISTANT: Sir . Kenny turns , harsh
KENNY: What is it ?
ASSISTANT: The number you asked for .
KENNY: I ask for a lot of 'em . Whose is it ?
ASSISTANT: Dean Acheson 's , sir .
KENNY: Got ta go , Scotty . See you tomorrow .
BOBBY: Screw secrecy . You try having that fat ass sit on your lap all the way from Foggy Bottom .
MCNAMARA: You were excited . I say no more .
BOBBY: Everybody agrees the diplomatic route is out . It 's too slow , and they 'll have the missiles finished .
GENERAL SWEENEY: We have 850 planes assembling at Homestead , Eglin , Opa Locka , MacDill , Patrick , Pensacola and Key West .
ADLAI: I still think there are diplomatic approaches we have n't considered yet .
GENERAL TAYLOR: We have high confidence in the expanded air strike option . The problem , Mr. President , is that it 's a short-term solution . Khruschev can send more missiles next month . The Chiefs and I believe we should follow up the air strikes with the full version of
THE PRESIDENT: An invasion
GENERAL TAYLOR: Yes , sir . We can be sure we get all the missiles , and we remove Castro so this can never happen again .
THE PRESIDENT: Is this the Chiefs ' recommendation ?
GENERAL TAYLOR: Yes , sir . Our best option is to commence the strikes before the missiles are operational . The invasion happens eight days later .
THE PRESIDENT: Dean . What do you think ?
ACHESON: Mr. President , you have rightly dismissed the diplomatic option . The Soviet will only tie you down in negotiation , and leave us short of ou goal , the removal of the missiles . Negotiating will do nothing more than give them time to make the missiles operational , complicating the necessary military task we have at hand .
THE PRESIDENT: Then it appears we have three options . Number one . A surgical air strike against the missiles themselves . Two , a larger air strike against their ai defenses along with the missiles .
GENERAL TAYLOR: Yes , sir , we 're preparing to implement all three options , though I must stress again , sir , there are risks to the strikes without the follow-on invasion .
BUNDY: You want to be clear , Mr. President , that we have definitely decided against a political track .
THE PRESIDENT: Dean , how does this play out ?
ACHESON: Your first step , sir , will be to demand that the Soviet withdraw the missiles within 12 to 24 hours . They will efuse . When they do , you will orde the strikes , followed by the invasion . They will resist , but will be overrun . They will retaliate against a target somewhere else in the world , most likely Berlin . We will honor our treaty commitments and resist them there , defeating them per our plans .
THE PRESIDENT: Those plans call for the use of nuclea weapons . And what is the next step ?
ACHESON: Hopefully cooler heads will prevail efore we reach the next step .
GENERAL TAYLOR: If McNamara 'd get off the fence
BUNDY: We have time .
GENERAL CARTER: Goddamn it , it 's obvious . It 's the only option . That asshole , Stevenson . We ca n't let this drag out or we lose ou shot .
BUNDY: Bombing them
ACHESON: Remember that the Kennedys ' father was one of the architects of Munich . The General is right . There is only one esponsible choice here .
KENNY: Jesus Christ Almighty
THE PRESIDENT: Acheson 's scenario is unacceptable . And he has more experience than anyone .
KENNY: There is no expert on this subject , no wise old man .
THE PRESIDENT: The thing is , Acheson 's right . Talk alone wo n't accomplish anything .
KENNY: Then let 's bomb the shit out of them . Everyone wants to , even you , even me . It sure would feel good .
BOBBY: Jack , I 'm as conniving as they come , but a sneak attack is just wrong .
KENNY: He 's right . And things are happening too fast . It smells like the Bay of Pigs all over again .
BOBBY: As if dealing with the Russians was n't hard enough , we got ta worry about ou own house .
THE PRESIDENT: Tonight , listening to Taylor and Acheson , I kept seeing Burke and Dulles telling me all I had to do was sign on the dotted line . The invasion would succeed . Castro would be gone . Just like that . Easy .
RESTON: Kenny ! What happened ? They did n't let me up front , said the President was on the phone the whole time .
KENNY: He was .
RESTON: Yeah ? Who was he talking to ? Acheson ? Come on , O'Donnell , everyone 's wondering what 's going on . What 's Acheson doing in town ? And do n't give me some ullshit about DNC think tanks . Acheson 's Mr . Cold War .
KENNY: Why do n't you ask him yourself ? You can have him on the way home .
RESTON: I 'm giving you a chance here talk to me . You can influence how this thing unfolds .
THE PRESIDENT: Let 's get out of here .
KENNY: Cheer up , you 've neutralized the entire White House Press Corps for a day .
BOBBY: No . No . No . There is more than one option here . If one is n't occurring to us , it 's because we have n't thought hard enough .
MCCONE: Sometimes there is only one right choice , and you thank God when it 's clear .
BOBBY: You 're talking about a sneak attack ! How 'll that make us look ? Big country lasting a little one into the stone age . We 'll be real favorites around the world .
ACHESON: Bobby , that 's naive . This is the real world , you know that better than anybody . Your argument is ridiculous .
MCCONE: You were n't so ethically particular when we were talking about options fo emoving Castro over at CIA .
BOBBY: I ca n't let my brother go down in History like a villain , like a Tojo , ordering another Pearl Harbor .
MCNAMARA: Six months ago we gamed out a scenario . It 's slow . It does n't get rid of the missiles . There are a lot of drawbacks . The scenario was for a blockade of Cuba .
GENERAL TAYLOR: The situation is worse than we thought . We count 40 missiles now , longer range IRBMs . They can hit every city in the continental U.S .
LEMAY: Mr. President , as of this moment my planes are ready to carry out the ai strikes . All you have to do is give me the word , sir , and my boys will get those Red bastards .
THE PRESIDENT: How long until the army is ready ?
GENERAL TAYLOR: We 've just begun the mobilization unde cover of a pre-arranged exercise , sir . We 're looking at another week and a half , Mr. President .
LEMAY: But you can begin the strikes , now . The plans call for an eight-day ai campaign . It 'd light a fire under the army 's ass to get in place .
THE PRESIDENT: General LeMay , do you truly believe that 's our best course of action ?
LEMAY: Mr. President , I believe it is the only course of action . American is in danger . Those missiles are a threat to our bomber bases and the safety of ou nuclear deterrent . Without ou deterrent , there 's nothing to keep the enemy from choosing general nuclear war . It 's our duty , our responsibility to the American people to take out those missiles and return stability to the strategic situation . The Big Red Dog is digging in our back yard , and we 're justified in shooting him .
GENERAL TAYLOR: Sir , we have a rapidly closing window of opportunity where we can prevent those missiles from ever becoming operational . The other options
LEMAY: Mr. President , the motto I chose for SAC is 'Peace is our Profession . ' God forbid we find ourselves in a nuclea exchange . But if launched , those missiles in Cuba would kill a lot of Americans . That 's why I 'm being such a pain in the ass about destroying them . Destroying them immediately . Hell , even Mac agrees .
THE PRESIDENT: General , what will the Soviets do when we attack ?
LEMAY: Nothing .
THE PRESIDENT: Nothing ?
LEMAY: Nothing . Because the only alternative open to them is one they ca n't choose .
THE PRESIDENT: Those are n't just missiles we 'll be destroying . We kill Soviet soldiers , and they will respond . How would we espond if they killed ours ? No , they will do something , General , I promise you that . And I believe it 'll be Berlin .
LEMAY: Those goddamn Kennedys are going to destroy this country if we do n't do something about this .
KENNY: I was hoping LeMay pushed you . I would n't mind going a few rounds with him .
THE PRESIDENT: We knew it was coming . I tell you , Kenny , these brass hats have one big advantage . We do what they want us to , none of us will be alive to tell 'em they were wrong . Bobby , Rusk and Sorensen enter from the hall .
SORENSEN: Mr. President , Gromyko should be on his way by now .
RUSK: We need to go over what you 're going to say .
BOBBY: There 's still no sign they know that we know about the missiles . Been a lot of cloud cover ; probably think we are n't getting any good product .
THE PRESIDENT: We keep 'em in the dark as long as we can . But I sure as hell am going to test him .
SALINGER: Kenny , I 'm getting funny questions from the guys in the press office . As Press Secretary , I need to know . What 's going on ?
KENNY: They 're planning to shave you bald next time you fall asleep on the bus . Sorry , Pierre , Gromyko just arrived .
RESTON: Are they going to discuss the military exercises going on in Florida ?
KENNY: Come on , Scotty . This meeting 's been on the books for months . It 's just a friendly talk on U.S.-Soviet relations .
THE PRESIDENT: So that there should be no misunderstanding , the position of the United States , which has been made clea y the Attorney General to Ambassado Dobrynin here , I shall read a sentence from my own statement to the press dated September 13th . Should missiles or offensive weapons be placed in Cuba , it would present the gravest threat to U.S. national security .
GROMYKO: Mr. President , this will never be done . You need not be concerned .
THE PRESIDENT: So I do not misunderstand you there are no offensive weapons in Cuba .
GROMYKO: No , Mr. President . We have sent defensive weapons only to Cuba .
BOBBY: What happened ?
THE PRESIDENT: Lying bastard . Lied to my face .
BOBBY: We 're split down the middle . If I held a vote I think airstrike would beat lockade by a vote or two .
THE PRESIDENT: I want a consensus , Bobby . Consensus . Either air strike or blockade . Something everyone 'll stand by even if they do n't like it . I need it by Saturday . Make it happen .
BOBBY: What if I ca n't ?
KENNY: We go into this split , the Russians will know it . And they 'll use it against us . The prospect disturbs the three men .
THE PRESIDENT: Have you cancelled Chicago and the rest of the weekend yet ?
KENNY: You do n't show for Chicago , everyone 'll know there 's something going on .
THE PRESIDENT: I do n't care . Cancel it .
KENNY: No way .
THE PRESIDENT: You 're scared to cancel on Daly .
KENNY: Damn right I 'm scared .
THE PRESIDENT: Well , I 'm not .
BOBBY: Then you 'll call , right ?
SALINGER: Kenny , all right . What 's going on here ? There 's rumors going around an exercise in the southeast is related to Cuba . I 'm the Press Secretary . I ca n't do my job if I do n't know what 's going on . So what 's going on ?
KENNY: What are you telling them ?
SALINGER: The truth I do n't know .
KENNY: Tell 'em you 've looked into it , and all it is is an exercise . And Pierre The President may have a cold tomorrow .
SALINGER: Damn it , Kenny . Goddamn it !
RESTON: There are major rail disruptions in the South , two airborne divisions are on alert . That exercise is an invasion .
KENNY: Well , you know how Bobby has it in fo the State of Mississippi .
RESTON: This is about Cuba . Kenny freezes , then explodes .
KENNY: Cuba ? You 're fucking crazy . We are not invading Cuba . Nobody gives a rat 's ass about Cuba . Not now , not ever . If you print something like that , all you 're going to do is inflame the situation . Nobody talks to assholes who inflame situations . Assholes like that can find themselves cut out of the loop .
RESTON: You 've never threatened me before .
KENNY: Tell Pierre I need to talk to him . Bobby ?
BOBBY: Bring him back .
SALINGER: The President has a cold . He is cancelling the remainder of this trip and is returning to Washington on the advice of his doctor .
RUSK: Mr. President , our deliberations have led us to the conclusion that , for the moment , a blockade of offensive weapons to Cuba is our best option . But we 'll still need a strong showing of support from the Organization of American States to give us an umbrella of legitimacy .
MCNAMARA: A blockade is technically an act of war , therefore we recommend calling the action a quarantine .
BOBBY: We believe that a surprise attack would e counter to what the United States stands for . We believe that an attack leaves us no room for maneuver , and the inevitable Soviet response will force us into a war we do not want . A war that , this time , will really end all war .
MCCONE: Mr. President , there are still those of us who believe we should proceed with the strikes . With the blockade , we lose strategic surprise and we run the risk of a first strike if the Soviets decide they have to use the missiles or lose them .
THE PRESIDENT: Quarantine or air strike .
ADLAI: There is a third option . With eithe course we undertake the risk of nuclea war . It seems to me maybe one of us in here should be a coward .
THE PRESIDENT: I do n't think that 's possible , Adlai . I will be asking the networks for ai time Monday night . I have not yet made my final decision . We will announce ou course of action then . I want to thank you all for your advice , gentlemen .
BOBBY: Goddman Stevenson . Jesus . Peace at any price . You 'd think nobody learned anything from World War Two .
THE PRESIDENT: Somebody had to say it . I respect Adlai for having the guts to risk looking like an appeaser .
BOBBY: We have to pull him . He 's not going to e able to handle the Soviets in front of the U.N. Zorin will eat him alive .
THE PRESIDENT: We 've got bigger problems right now .
KENNY: We have to try the blockades . It probably wo n't work . It may just be delaying the inevitable . But we ca n't just go to war without trying not to .
THE PRESIDENT: I do n't know . I do n't know .
ADLAI: Just ca n't get away from you guys . Escaping for a night on the town , eh ?
KENNY: As the town 's most popular playboy , the President felt my presence would be sorely missed . So in the interests of National Security
ADLAI: Got ta keep up appearances . Of course , I do n't care anymore . I 'm a political dead man . You ever seen a man cut his own throat like I did today ?
KENNY: We 're not going to make it to Monday . I 'll try to lean on Reston , but you 're going to have to call Orville Dryfoos . This is the sort of decision the publisher makes himself .
DRYFOOS: Yes , sir , I understand . But we held on Bay of Pigs and it was the biggest mistake of my life . What makes this any different ?
THE PRESIDENT: I 'm asking you to hold the story until I can present our course of action on Monday night .
DRYFOOS: All right . But I need a reason to give my boys . They 're going to be screaming for my head on a plate .
THE PRESIDENT: Orville . I want you to tell them this they 'll be saving lives . Maybe even including their own .
DRYFOOS: Yes , Mr. President .
KENNY: Acheson called , DeGaulle 's with us ; have n't heard from anyone else yet .
BOBBY: He wants to talk to LeMay again .
THE PRESIDENT: Cam , can you guarantee me you 'll get all the missiles ?
GENERAL SWEENEY: Sir , I can guarantee we 'll get all the missiles we know about .
LEMAY: Mr. President , we can get better than ninety percent of them .
THE PRESIDENT: As of seven o'clock Monday night , all United States armed forces world wide will stand up to DEFCON 3 .
KENNY: You 'd worry that something was wrong if Congress offered you unconditional support .
THE PRESIDENT: They want this fucking job , they can have it . It 's no great joy to me . The President exhales , getting control .
BOBBY: We 're getting the Soviet response .
KENNY: This is all rhetoric . They do n't know how to respond yet .
THE PRESIDENT: So now you 're Khurschev . What do you do ?
KENNY: run the blockade . They 'll run the lockade .
ADMIRAL ANDERSON: Which is exactly what they appear to be preparing to do , Mr. President . We 're tracking 26 ships inbound to Cuba . There 's no sign they 're changing course . The closest ships , the Gagarin and the Kimovsk , will make the quarantine line y this time tomorrow .
MCNAMARA: We 're concerned about the possibility of an incident with an innocent cargo carrier . If it turns ugly , the Russians could use an ugly incident and bad world opinion as leverage to force us to emove the quarantine .
MCCONE: Or they could use it as an excuse to escalate .
BOBBY: Admiral Anderson , if the ships do not stop , what exactly are our rules of engagement ?
ADMIRAL ANDERSON: A warning shot will be fired across its ow . Bobby stops , stares directly at the Admiral .
BOBBY: And what happens if the ship ignores the warning shot ?
ADMIRAL ANDERSON: Then we fire at its rudder , disable it , and carry out the inspection .
THE PRESIDENT: There will be no shooting without my explicit orders . Is that understood ?
ADMIRAL ANDERSON: Yes , sir . The President glances at McNamara .
THE PRESIDENT: Well , Admiral , it looks like it 's up to the Navy .
ADMIRAL ANDERSON: The Navy wo n't let you down , sir .
THE PRESIDENT: General , have we developed any more information on the missiles ?
GENERAL TAYLOR: They are continuing to proceed with the development . We 're commencing low-level photography runs this morning .
MCCONE: The pictures will be used to firm up ou estimates of the missiles ' readiness and develop target packages for strikes should you order them .
GENERAL TAYLOR: Our guy running this show is the best . Commander Bill Ecker of the Navy 's VFP 62 , the Fightin ' Photo . Something of a character , but the highest efficiency atings we 've ever had .
ECKER: 75 millimeter , I 'm listening . On the ig screen there 's nothing like it .
WILHEMY: Watch out , Hollywood . There 's a new epic director in town !
GENERAL TAYLOR: We have a flight of Thunderchiefs able to respond within minutes of an attack on our planes .
KENNY: I do n't like what 's happening .
THE PRESIDENT: In the morning I 'm taking charge of the lockade from the situation room . McNamara 'll set up shop in the flag plot at the Pentagon , keep an eye on things there .
KENNY: All right . 'Cause you get armed oarders climbing into Soviet ships , shots being fired across bows
THE PRESIDENT: I know , I know
KENNY: What about these low-level flights ? They 're starting in what ? An hour ? Do you realize what you 're letting yourself in for ?
THE PRESIDENT: We need those flights . We have to know when those missiles become operational , ecause when they do , we need to destroy them .
KENNY: Fair enough . But Castro 's on alert and we 're flying attack planes over thei sites , on the deck . There 's no way fo them to know they 're carrying cameras , not bombs . They 're going to be shot at , plain and simple .
THE PRESIDENT: I 'm gon na protect those pilots .
KENNY: They 're boxing us in with these rules of engagement . If you agree to 'em , and one of our planes gets knocked down o one of the ships wo n't stop fo inspection , the Chiefs will have us by the balls and will force us to start shooting . They want a war , and they 're arranging things to get one . If you do n't want one , we have to do something about it .
THE PRESIDENT: How does a man get to a place where he can say , 'throw those lives away , ' so easily ?
KENNY: Maybe it 's harder for them to say it than they let on . At the very least , they believe it 's in our best interest . And at the end of the day , they may end up being right .
THE PRESIDENT: Triple check everything the Chiefs say to us with the guys who actually have to do it . No one 's to know about this but Bobby . I need redundant control ove what happens out there . And if things are n't as advertised , you 're going to make sure they come out the way I want them to come out , starting with this low level flight thing .
KENNY: That 's going to be tough . You know how these guys are about their chains of command
THE PRESIDENT: Any problems , you remind them those chains of commands end at one place . Me .
RUSK: Mr. President . The OAS meeting starts in an hour . I have n't prepared at all . We ca n't expect
THE PRESIDENT: we need this one , Dean . The quarantine 's legal if we get a mandate , otherwise it 's an act of war in the eyes of the world . Get me that vote . Make it unanimous .
RUSK: Mr. President , The Organization of American States has n't had a unanimous vote since The President moves for the Cabinet Room .
THE PRESIDENT: unanimous , Dean .
MARGARET: White House Operator . Yes sir . Speaker McCormack , hold for the Vice President .
KENNY: Ma'am , would you mind helping me out with a few special calls ?
ECKER: Orson Welles is a hack . Now you want to talk about a director , you talk about David Lean
WILHEMY: Welles is a G-d . Lean 's the hack .
ECKER: Bullshit , Bruce , nobody but Lean is making decent movies these days . Get that fixed yet ?
YOUNG PILOT: Uhhh yup . Think so .
DUTY SERGEANT: Sirtelephone , sir .
ECKER: VFP-62 , Fightin ' Photo , here . But what we really want to do is direct .
MARGARET: This is the White House Operator . Hold for the President .
ECKER: Oh shit .
MARGARET: Honey , you do n't know what shit is .
KENNY: Commander , my name is Ken O'Donnell . Special Assistant to the President .
ECKER: Yes , sir .
KENNY: I do n't think you understand me correctly . You are not to get shot down under any circumstances . Whateve happens up there , you were not shot at . Mechanical failures are fine ; crashing into mountains , fine . But you and you men are not to be shot at , fired at , launched upon .
ECKER: Excuse me , sir , what 's going on here ?
KENNY: Commander , if you are fired upon , the President will be forced to attack the sites that fire on you . He does n't want to have to do that . It 's very important that he does n't , or things could go very adly out of control .
ECKER: I think I understand . What about my men ? If it comes up hot and heavy , and we do n't have anyone to protect us I 'm going to be writing letters to parents . I hate writing letters to parents .
KENNY: If the President protects you , Commander , he may have to do it with the Bomb .
ECKER: Okay , Mr. O'Donnell . We 'll do what we can .
WILHEMY: Yeah . It sucks . Ai n't for high performance babies like ours . Shoulda ought some from home , but what can you do ? Last-second deployments
ECKER: Okay , time to play Spin the Bottle with our bearded buddy . Nobody gets out ahead . Remember , just sitting here we 're only ten minutes from target .
WILHEMY: Holy shit !
ECKER: Lights .
WILHEMY: You shoulda seen it , Chief , they
ECKER: damn sparrows . Must 've been migrating . Guess I hit a couple hundred . How many did you hit , Bruce ?
WILHEMY: A few . I guess .
ECKER: Those are bird strikes . Sparrows to be precise . Got a problem with that ?
KENNY: Yeah ?
BALL: Kenny . The vote just came down .
RUSK: Unanimous . One abstenation .
THE PRESIDENT: About time something went our way .
ASSISTANT: Telephone , Mr. O'Donnell .
KENNY: Hello ?
ECKER: Mr. O'Donnell , I 've been ordered to deliver the film to the Pentagon personally . What 's going on ?
KENNY: The Chiefs must want to talk to you . Listen to me , Commander , they 'll want to know if you were fired on . Were you ?
ECKER: Commander William B. Ecker reporting as ordered ! LeMay rises , prowls over to Ecker .
LEMAY: Son , I want to know just one thing . Those bastards shoot so much as a BB gun at you ?
ECKER: Sir , it was a milk run , sir .
GENERAL TAYLOR: It appears our low-level flights are getting back okay . Some unconfirmed eports of small-arms fire from some of the missions , but that 's it .
THE PRESIDENT: Guess we ca n't blame Khruschev for a few patriotic farmers . And the ships ?
GENERAL TAYLOR: Still heading for Cuba .
THE PRESIDENT: All right . Then I guess it 's time .
KENNY: I do n't know , Helen . I want you to keep the kids close tomorrow . Leave the T.V . on , sleep with it on in the bedroom until I tell you you can turn it off .
BUNDY: I just checked myself . They 're being issued identity cards . Call comes , and evacuation officers meet them at pre-arranged departure areas . They go by helicopter to Mount Weather . We meet them there .
BOBBY: Course that 's for morale . The missiles only take five minutes to get here .
POLICE OFFICER: Would you like me to call a car , Mr. O'Donnell . Kenny checks his watch .
KENNY: How long will it take to get someone up ?
POLICE OFFICER: Fifteen minutes , maybe . To your house , sir ?
KENNY: No . No , I 'll let her sleep . Let 'em sleep .
THE PRESIDENT: Okay , Bob , I 'm putting you on intercom . Suddenly , McNamara 's VOICE fills the room .
MCNAMARA: I have one minute til ten here
THE PRESIDENT: Bob , the quarantine is now in effect .
MCNAMARA: Then it looks like our first customers are the Gagarin and Kimovsk .
CAPTAIN: Helm , shape heading for intercept , zero one zero . All ahead full
CHIEF SONARMAN: Submerged contact , designation Sierra one at 6000 yards bearing 030 .
CAPTAIN: A submarine
GENERAL TAYLOR: It 's protecting the freighters .
THE PRESIDENT: Bob , is there any way we can avoid stopping a submarine first ?
CAPTAIN: Mr. President ?
THE PRESIDENT: Captain , can you force that submarine to the surface for inspection without damaging it yourself ?
CAPTAIN: I can bring it up , Mr. President . But whether it 's damaged or not is up to the sub .
MCCONE: Even if they force it up , that sub will e inspected over the crews ' dead odies . They 'd be executed for allowing it when they got home .
THE PRESIDENT: Captain , force the sub to the surface for inspection .
RUSK: Are they stopping ?
MCNAMARA: we 've got reports coming from all over ! The ships are stopping ! Some are turning around !
RUSK: We were eyeball to eyeball and I think the other fellow just blinked .
MCCONE: Mr. President .
THE PRESIDENT: Captain , have the ships you 're observing changed course ?
BOBBY: It 's an accident . They must not have gotten their orders yet . Let 'em go .
GENERAL TAYLOR: Unlikely , Mr. President . We 've been monitoring transmissions from both the Gagarin and Kimovsk . Their radios are working fine .
MCCONE: One ship , an accident maybe . Six this is intentional .
KENNY: They 're right . This is intentional .
MCCONE: If we do , it erodes the credibility of the quarantine . He 'll just send more through tomorrow . The President looks at Kenny .
KENNY: Then we deal with it tomorrow . But today he 's stopped most of them . He 's done something smart here . We gave him an ultimatum , and he 's agreed to most of it , preserving just enough room to save face . We need to do something just as smart now .
MCNAMARA: Mr. President , I agree . Let them go . Four of the six continuing ships are still a day away from the line . They 've stopped all the ones we suspect have weapons aboard . It would look bad shooting up a freighter full of baby food .
THE PRESIDENT: Captain , I want you to maintain contact with those ships . Do nothing until I order otherwise . Is that clear ?
BOBBY: What happened to speak when spoken to ?
KENNY: Give it a rest . You were thinking the same thing , just did n't have the guts to take the heat .
THE PRESIDENT: We can horsetrade with Khruschev on ships . But it does n't get us any close to removing those missiles .
KENNY: Have to hope it 's a signal that he 'll ack down on the real issue too .
BOBBY: We 're going to have to stop a ship eventually , show the quarantine 's got teeth , or we 'll prove McCone right .
THE PRESIDENT: McNamara 's on his way back here now . We need to pick the right ship . No subs . No armed boarding parties either . We need a little more time to figure this one out .
KENNY: Then let 's move the quarantine line .
MCNAMARA: Mr. President . Bobby . Kenny . The Essex battle group has the Gagarin , Kimovsk and the sub escort under thei thumb . We 've got a few hours now before we need to worry about any more flashpoints on the line . We could use a few more hours . I think we should consider moving the quarantine line back to 500 miles .
KENNY: Moving the line . Stroke of genius .
MCNAMARA: Of course it is . But the President needs to realize we 're going to have to stop a ship eventually . They turn a corner , silence for a beat .
KENNY: The Chiefs are looking for a provocation out there . The President 's going to come under enormous pressure . You have to keep 'em on a short leash , Bob . McNamara spares Kenny a short , nasty look .
MCNAMARA: You must think I 'm blind and stupid . I 've already gotten the birds and bees from Bobby . The President does n't have to double-barrel me .
KENNY: Listen to me , goddamn it . We 're talking about a possible nuclear war . You dropped the ball on Bay of Pigs
MCNAMARA: you sonofabitch , goddamn it , I did n't drop
KENNY: You were in the room . It was you purview . It was your job to make sure Bissel was n't fucking us over and you did n't do it . You 've got the most important job in the world right now . You 're the smartest guy the President has . Besides me .
MCNAMARA: Anybody ever tell you you 're an egomaniac and a prick , O'Donnell ?
KENNY: You need to be the best you 've eve een .
THE PRESIDENT: how the goddamn hell did this happen ? I 'm going to have Power 's head on a platter next to LeMay 's ! Hey , Kenny , did you hear me give the order to go to DEFCON 2 ? I remembe giving the order to go to DEFCON 3 , but I must be suffering from amnesia because I 've just been informed our nuclea forces are DEFCON 2 !
GENERAL TAYLOR: Technically , General LeMay is correct that SAC has the statutory authority The President punches his desk .
THE PRESIDENT: I have the authority . I am the commander-in-chief of the United States , and I say when we go to war !
GENERAL TAYLOR: We are not at war , sir , not until we 're at DEFCON 1 .
THE PRESIDENT: General , the Joint Chiefs have just signalled our intent to escalate to the Soviets . You have signalled an escalation which I had no wish to signal , and which I did not approve .
BOBBY: LeMay he 's history .
THE PRESIDENT: Get out of here , Max .
KENNY: Jesus
BOBBY: Rescind the order . Can all the Chiefs . Put Nitze , Gilpatric and the Undersecretaries in charge .
KENNY: We ca n't do that , Bobby .
THE PRESIDENT: He 's right , we ca n't rescind DEFCON 2 . The Soviets will think we 've gotten sweet on them .
KENNY: And we ca n't purge the Chiefs . Ou invasion talk will look like a bluff . Or even that there 's been an attempted coup . Bobby is disgusted , but knows they 're right .
BOBBY: McNamara wo n't be able to handle them . It 's too much for one man with all due respect to our heroic fifth column .
KENNY: We 've got Khruschev 's attention with the lockade . If we want a political solution . I think it 's time to turn up the diplomatic heat . Cause if we let this go on too long , we 're going to find ourselves in a war .
THE PRESIDENT: I 've been considering a variation on one of Stevenson 's ideas . We 're going to send up a trial balloon through Lippman . The Jupiter missiles .
BUNDY: What did you think of Lippman 's column this morning ?
KENNY: I think it 's a bad idea . Bundy turns back to him .
BUNDY: Thank God . Look , everyone is furious about it . We trade away our missiles in Turkey and we 're fucked politically .
KENNY: Then they should speak up .
BUNDY: Christ , Ken , you know it 's not that easy .
KENNY: Yes it is .
BUNDY: No it is n't . They do n't trust the people that feel this way . But these people are right . And the Kennedys are wrong . We need you to tell 'em , Kenny . They 'll listen to you .
KENNY: You listen to me . Nobody , nobody , talks about my friends that way . You 're fucking here right now because of the Kennedys . They may be wrong . They make mistakes . But they 're not weak . The weak ones are these 'people ' who ca n't speak their own minds .
BUNDY: You know I do n't mean they 're weak . Kenny gets in his face , intimidating .
KENNY: No , they just lack 'moral toughness . ' And you think I 'll play your Judas . You WASPS and blue-bloods never understood us , thinking we want into your club . Well we got our own club now . And you guys do n't realize fighting with each other is our way . Nobody plays us off each other . And nobody ever gets etween us
THE PRESIDENT: What 's that ?
KENNY: Oh , just a bunch of crap about withdrawing our Jupiter missiles in Turkey if the Soviets 'll do the same in Cuba .
THE PRESIDENT: I do n't want to listen to this again .
KENNY: If we made a trade , we 'd be giving in to extortion , and NATO would never trust us again . We 'll get clobbered in world opinion .
THE PRESIDENT: It 's a goddman trial balloon . Trial is the operative word , here .
KENNY: Then somebody 'd better deny it publicly .
THE PRESIDENT: Jesus Christ , O'Donnell , you 're the one saying we need to move forward on a political solution .
KENNY: Yeah , a good political solution .
THE PRESIDENT: You want to turn up the heat ? You call Adlai . Tell him to stick it to Zorin .
BOBBY: Adlai 's too weak ! We have to convince Jack to pull him , get McCloy in there .
KENNY: You ca n't take him out this late in the game .
BOBBY: Zorin will eat him alive !
KENNY: Then talk to your brother , goddamn it . The two of you do n't need any advice to get into trouble .
BOBBY: What 's gotten into you ? Kenny throws the Lippman article at him .
KENNY: Something your father would 've come up with .
BOBBY: My father
KENNY: I 'm just trying to make a point . This idea is that fucking bad .
BOBBY: He better . Because nobody thinks he 's up to this . Nobody .
ADLAI: Yes ?
KENNY: Adlai , it 's Kenny . How 're you doing ?
ADLAI: Busy , Ken . What do you need ?
KENNY: The President told me to pass the word to you stick it to them .
ADLAI: I hear you . I 'm glad it 's you calling . I thought it would be Bobby . If they 're still sticking to their stonewall strategy , I 'll get 'em . Thanks , Ken .
ROMANIAN DELEGATE: we call upon the world to condemn this purely American provocation
ZORIN: We are glad you could join us , Mr. Stevenson .
BOBBY: I make the call , and Adlai is out . McCloy goes in . Bobby looks back at Kenny .
THE PRESIDENT: Let 's hope it does n't come to that .
ZORIN: The United States has no facts in hand . Falsity is what America has in its hands - false evidence .
ADLAI: Well , let me say something to you , Mr . Ambassador , we do have the evidence . We have it , and it is clear and incontrovertible .
BUNDY: Come on , Adlai !
ADLAI: Mr. Zorin , I remind you that the othe day you did not deny the existence of these weapons . But today , again , if I heard you correctly , you now say they do not exist .
RUSK: Come on , Adlai , do n't let him off !
BOBBY: John ? It 's Bobby . Get ready to send your staffer in . He 's going to be coming out .
ADLAI: All right , sir . Let me ask you one simple question . Do you , Ambassado Zorin , deny that the U.S.S.R. has placed and is placing medium and intermediate ange missiles and sites in Cuba ? Yes or no - do n't wait for the translation - yes or no ?
KENNY: Yeah . Yeah .
ZORIN: I am not in an American courtroom , sir , and therefore I do not wish to answer a question that is put to me in the fashion in which a prosecutor puts questions . In due course , sir , you will have your answer .
ADLAI: You are in the courtroom of world opinion right now , and you can answe yes or no . You have denied they exist , and I want to know if I have understood you correctly .
BOBBY: John , I 'll get back to you .
ADLAI: And I 'm prepared to present the evidence in this room , proving that the Soviet Union has lied to the world .
ZORIN: If you do not choose to continue you statement , the Chair recognizes the epresentative from Chile . The CHILEAN DELEGATE stands .
CHILEAN DELEGATE: I yield my time and the floor to the epresentative to the United States .
ADLAI: Well then , ladies and gentlemen , since it appears we might be here for a while , shall we have a look at what the Soviets are doing in Cuba ?
THE PRESIDENT: Did n't know Adlai had it in him . Too ad he did n't have this stuff in '52 .
KENNY: Zorin must not have gotten instructions . Somebody in their Foreign Ministry 's lown it big-time . Bundy steps forward , holding the phone .
BUNDY: Mr. President
MCNAMARA: the ship is called Groznyy .
ADMIRAL ANDERSON: Hail them again .
MCNAMARA: We 're kidding ourselves
ADMIRAL ANDERSON: Very well . Load your guns .
MCNAMARA: What was that , Admiral ?
ADMIRAL ANDERSON: We 've been hailing the Groznyy for the last hour , Mr. Secretary . The Groznyy efuses to stop .
MCNAMARA: What are you doing ?
ADMIRAL ANDERSON: Carrying out our mission , Mr. Secretary . If you do n't mind , we 're very busy right now . We need to be able to do our jobs .
MCNAMARA: Admiral , I asked you a question .
ADMIRAL ANDERSON: We 're going to follow the Rules of Engagement . The Rules of Engagement which the President has approved and signed in his order of October 23rd . Anderson listens again to the phone .
MCNAMARA: What
ADMIRAL ANDERSON: That ship was firing starshells . Starshells . Flares , Mr. Secretary .
MCNAMARA: Starshells .
ADMIRAL ANDERSON: Get out of our way , Mr. Secretary . The navy has been running blockades since the days of John Paul Jones .
MCNAMARA: I believe the President made it clea that there would be no firing on ships without his express permission .
ADMIRAL ANDERSON: With all due respect , Mr. Secretary , we were not firing on the ship . Firing on a ship means attacking the ship . We were not attacking the ship . We were firing over it .
MCNAMARA: This was not the President 's intention when he gave that order . What if the Soviets do n't see the distention ? What if they make the same mistake I just did ? There will be no firing anything nea ANY Soviet ships without my express permission , is that understood , Admiral ?
ADMIRAL ANDERSON: Yes , sir .
MCNAMARA: And I will only issue such instructions when ordered to by the President . John Paul Jones you do n't understand a thing , do you , Admiral ?
RUSK: Kenny , we need to see the President . Something 's happened .
SCALI: I have lunch with him maybe once a month . Way he talks , he acts like he knows Khruschev personally , but he 's never elaborated . I 've used him as a source in a couple of stories .
RUSK: The FBI has identified this Alexande Fomin as the Soviet Resident , the KGB equivalent of one of our station chiefs . He 's their highest ranking spy in this country . And he knows John 's a friend of mine .
BUNDY: All the trademarks of a back-channel overture .
THE PRESIDENT: So they 'll remove the missiles , and we 'll pledge not to invade Cuba , destabilize Castro or assist anyone who plans in doing so
BOBBY: I think this may be our first real message from Khruschev .
MCCONE: The alternative , Mr. President , is that this could be a trap .
KENNY: Dangle a settlement , tie us down in negotiations , we come up short
MCCONE: Why else would they approach us in this way ? It 's deniable . The Soviets have done nothing but lie to us . This could e more of the same .
KENNY: That may be why Khruschev 's introducing this guy . We 've been burned by his usual players in the formal channels , so he brings in an honest broker .
MCCONE: That may be what they want us to think .
RUSK: The truth is , Mr. President , we do n't even really know whom Fomin speaks for . It could be Khruschev . It could be some faction in the Politburo or the KGB itself . We just do n't know .
BOBBY: By the way , Scali , your activities now fall under the secrecy codicils of the National Security Act . Sorry , no Pulitzer .
SCALI: Mr. President , we do n't have much time . I 'm supposed to meet with him again in three and a half hours .
THE PRESIDENT: Well , it seems the question of the day is is the offer legitimate ?
GENERAL TAYLOR: Mr. President , I 'm afraid we have some ad news . We 're getting GMAIC estimates from our latest low-level overflights . It appears the missiles are two to three days away from operational status .
MCCONE: So we do n't have much time to play out ack-channel communiques .
GENERAL TAYLOR: The quarantine , sir , is not producing esults . The Chiefs feel it 's time you take another look at our options .
THE PRESIDENT: Kenny , get over to your old stomping grounds . Go through everything the FBI has on Fomin . I need your best call is this guy legit and is he speaking fo Khruschev ? And I need you to tell me by the time I call you , because right afte I call you , I 'm calling Scali with his instructions .
SHERIDAN: Okay . So , what we 've got is this guy Alexander Feklisov , aka Alexander Fomin , declared Consul to the Soviet Embassy , ut in reality the KGB Papa Spy . An illustrious tour of duty during the Great Patriotic War gets him on the Party fast track , various tours of duty in KGB , American postings . He 's an expert on us , and that 's all we 've got on Papa Spy .
KENNY: Who 's he talking for ? Is it Khruschev , or is this more bullshit ?
SHERIDAN: Got ta know someone . Kenny whirls on Sheridan . A frozen beat .
KENNY: Politics is politics . Walter . Khruschev is the Moscow Party Boss unde Stalin . Give me their caree chronologies !
SHERIDAN: It 's thin . But real life usually is .
KENNY: Hello ?
SCALI: I am instructed to tell you that the American Government would respond favorably to an offer along the lines you have discussed . If this solution were raised at the U.N. by Ambassado Zorin , he would find a favorable reply from Ambassador Stevenson .
FOMIN: So I understand you correctly . If the missiles in Cuba were dismantled , eturned to the Soviet Union , and a guarantee was made not to reintroduce them , the United States would be prepared to guarantee that it would never invade Cuba ?
SCALI: That is correct .
FOMIN: This is from the Highest Authority ?
SCALI: Yes . From the Highest Authority . There are two conditions . The U.N. must be allowed to inspect the removal of the missiles .
FOMIN: And , of course , the U.N. must be allowed to observe the redeployment of forces from the American Southeast .
SCALI: Time is of the essence .
FOMIN: John . How much time ?
SCALI: 48 hours . In 48 hours there can be no deals .
RUSK: Mr. President , we 're receiving a lette from Khruschev over at State .
TRANSLATOR: twoofuspullonthe knotofwar
KENNY: It 's ten pages of sentimental fluff , but he 's saying right here . He 'll remove the missiles in return for a no-invasion pledge . It looks like Fomin 's overture was genuine . The President turns to McCone .
MCCONE: Our early analysis says this was probably written by Khruschev himself . It 's a first draft , and shows no signs of being polished by the foreign ministry . In fact , it probably has n't een approved by the Politburo . They would n't have let the emotionalism go y . The analysts say it was written by someone under considerable stress . EXCOM chuckles .
THE PRESIDENT: Glad to hear we 're not alone .
KENNY: Hi .
HELEN: Hi , O'Donnell . You look old .
KENNY: we got a back channel communication from Khruschev this evening feeling us out about a deal . He confirmed it just a little while ago in a letter to the President . I think we 've won .
HELEN: A thing like this who could even think of winning ?
BOBBY: Where 've you been ? We 've been trying to find you all morning .
KENNY: Helen and I went out for breakfast . EXCOM 's not supposed to convene til eight .
BOBBY: We just got a second letter from Khruschev . The deal 's off .
KENNY: What does the letter say ?
BOBBY: They want us to take our missiles out of Turkey along with the no invasion pledge . It looks like Fomin was a ploy after all , and they were just stalling for time . Kenny is stunned .
MCCONE: My specialists are in agreement this morning 's letter is not Khruschev . Last night 's letter was . The evidence supports only one conclusion there has been a coup , and Khruschev was replaced overnight .
KENNY: Jesus Christ
THE PRESIDENT: Dean ?
RUSK: It does n't necessarily mean there 's been a coup . Khruschev 's name is signed to the letter .
MCNAMARA: Aw , come on , Dean !
RUSK: But at the very least It does suggest he 's been co-opted by hard line elements .
MCNAMARA: Which at the end of the day is the same thing as a coup . A puppet Khruschev , and a hard-line Soviet government pulling the strings . No deal . And the missiles are almost operational .
THE PRESIDENT: You know , the problem we have is that this is latest offer of theirs will seem easonable to everyone . We remove ou missiles , they remove theirs . Our Jupiters were scheduled for removal anyway . They 're obsolete , after all .
RUSK: Mr. President , agreeing to such a trade would be tantamount to paying ransom . They 'll put a gun to our head again , and expect us to pay again . Kenny looks the President in the eye .
KENNY: We ca n't sell out one of our friends fo our own safety . NATO would n't trust us anymore , and they 'd be right not to .
THE PRESIDENT: So which one of you geniuses can tell me how to explain ourselves to the world ? How do we work with them if there 's been a hard-line coup ?
GENERAL TAYLOR: Mr. President , there is anothe possibility we have n't considered . This may not be a coup at all .
MCNAMARA: Designed to keep us from taking action .
LUNDAHL: Mr. President
MCNAMARA: Then we 're out of time . We have to go in .
LUNDAHL: That may not be as easy as we thought either . We 've gotten confirmation that the Soviets have also deployed attlefield nuclear weapons to Cuba . A pall falls over the room as LeMay explains .
LEMAY: FROGS , we call 'em . Short range tactical nukes . It 's possible they 've delegated release authority to thei local commanders for use against ou invasion troops . It 'd be standard doctrine . Our capability to get all the missiles has eroded during our delay with the quarantine . The good news is that fo the moment we know where the FROGS are , and we can target them , too . But the longer we wait , the hard it 's going to get .
THE PRESIDENT: Then we have no choice . General , issue the warning orders to ou forces . They will be prepared to execute the air strikes Monday morning and the follow-on invasion according to the schedule thereafter . I 'll need the official release orders on my desk Sunday night .
GENERAL TAYLOR: Understood , sir . We need to step up the overflights , finalize our pilots ' target folders in order to be able to carry out the strikes . The President gives Kenny a meaningful look .
THE PRESIDENT: Permission granted .
MAJOR ANDERSON: This is Major Anderson .
KENNY: Major , my name is Kenneth O'Donnell . Special Assistant to the President .
MAJOR ANDERSON: Go ahead , sir .
KENNY: Last night , we looked like we were going to cut a deal to get us all out of this mess . Today , the Soviets are reneging . We 're going to try to salvage the situation , but a lot of things are going wrong today . It 's making everyone nervous , and it will be very hard to avoid going to war . Do n't get shot down , Major . Beyond that , whatever else you can do to help us , I 'd really appreciate it .
MAJOR ANDERSON: When you 're up there at 72,000 feet , there 's a million things that can go wrong . Is your oxygen mix right ? Will your cameras freeze up ? Are you leaving contrail Those million things are beyond you control , mostly But you know , when you realize that , there 's a kind of peace . You do n't need to be in control . You never were in control in the first place . If you 're a good man , and you ground crew are good men , it 's all you can ask for . And with the grace of G-d , it 'll get you through .
KENNY: Thank you , Major .
MAJOR ANDERSON: This is flight G3132 , requesting permission for take-off .
THE PRESIDENT: Does this attack on our plane represent a definitive , intentional escalation on the part of the Soviets ?
GENERAL TAYLOR: The Soviets are in control of the SAMs . It 's hard to believe with thei centralized command structure that it could be an accidental launch .
MCCONE: Mr. President , taken with the events of the past few hours , I believe this confirms our worst fears . We 're now dealing with a hard-line Soviet government , perhaps with Khruschev as a puppet head , perhaps not .
KENNY: It could be a mistake .
BUNDY: A U-2 on a routine air-sampling mission over Siberia got lost and penetrated Soviet airspace . The Soviets scrambled MIGs in pursuit , thinking it was a omber . It got out okay . Somebody forgot to cancel the mission .
THE PRESIDENT: Goddammitt . There 's always some sonofabitch who does n't get the word . All we need is the Soviets thinking we 're bombing them . Anybody else ? The humor falls on a cold audience .
GENERAL TAYLOR: Mr. President , our pilots are in danger . We must order punitive airstrikes against the SAM site that shot down Major Anderson per our rules of engagement .
THE PRESIDENT: No . I want confirmation there was n't some sort of accident first .
LEMAY: I think that 's a good idea , Mr. President . It 'll be safer for my boys to get those SAMs on Monday when we get the rest of the bastards . I can wait a day and a half .
THE PRESIDENT: Very well , then .
KEVIN: Hey ! Dad !
KENNY: Hey , sport . You winning ?
KEVIN: Yeah .
KENNY: Yeah , Kev . Everything 's gon na be fine .
KEVIN: I guess you wo n't be coming home tonight .
KENNY: I , uh
BOBBY: Kenny ! We need to talk . Kenny looks back at his son .
KENNY: Get back out there , kid . Remember to hit 'em hard .
KEVIN: What about you ? Where are you going ?
KENNY: Back to work .
BOBBY: And ?
KENNY: And Jack wants to trade the missiles in Turkey .
BOBBY: The Jupiters are obsolete . They were supposed to have been dismantled last summer anyway
KENNY: Jesus , Mary and Joseph . I told you how stupid it was to float the Lippman article ! But you would n't listen to me . What if there has n't been a coup at all ? What if it 's you two who invited that second letter by raising the possibility of a trade ? Bobby is speechless with rage .
BOBBY: All right , so maybe we overestimated how easonable this trade would look . Okay ? You happy ? So now what ?
KENNY: So now you 've got to talk him out of it . And then we 've got to figure out an acceptable political solution .
BOBBY: And if there has been a coup and there is no acceptable political solution ? Kenny stares off at the city , agonized .
RUSK: Whatever response we send , it will take several hours for the wire to be eceived by our embassy and delivered to the Kremlin . So we 're looking at early tomorrow morning at the earliest before Khruschev could respond .
BOBBY: He gets it , but he 's pissed .
THE PRESIDENT: That 's all well and good , but what do we say to 'em ?
SORENSEN: It depends on if we really believe there 's been a coup . That strikes a cord with Kenny .
KENNY: I agree . If there has been a coup , and there 's a hard-line government in powe now , then it does n't matter what we say . The end of the day we 'll either agree to their terms , they 'll agree to ours , o we 'll go to war . But what if there has n't been a coup ? What if what if what is happening is a series of accidents ?
SORENSEN: The second letter is an accident ?
KENNY: No . The letter is an intentional , but it 's having an effect far greater than its authors intended . What if our Jupiter missiles are just a last minute haggle to salvage something ? Maybe a bone Khruschev is throwing to the hard line , not really caring if we eject it or not ? And then these accidents have happened .
BOBBY: Making the second letter and the overall picture look worse than it really is .
SORENSEN: The Guns of August .
KENNY: Exactly . If they 're sane and human like we are , then maybe we just refuse , and they 'll let it slide , like we 've been letting things slide .
SORENSEN: So we reject the second letter . And Kenny looks at Bobby . The world stops .
KENNY: No . We do n't reject it It hits Bobby like a lightning bolt .
BOBBY: We accept the first letter and pretend the second does n't exist .
MCCONE: It wo n't work
MCNAMARA: Ignore the second letter , agree to the conditions of the first
GENERAL TAYLOR: There 's no reason to believe the Soviets will let it go .
RUSK: Max is right . Why will they accept it ?
MCNAMARA: It can work . If , IF they believe we 'll hit them .
RUSK: But we have to make them agree to it . So how do we do that ?
THE PRESIDENT: We give them something . We tell them we 'll remove the missiles from Turkey say , six months from now so that there appears to be no linkage . We also tell them if they go public about it , we deny it and the deal is off .
KENNY: And we do it under the table so we can disavow any knowledge of it .
MCCONE: It 's transparent . The press 'll be all over it .
KENNY: Six months from now , I 'm not going to care . Are you ? We 'll deal with it .
MCNAMARA: At least it will expose whethe Khruschev has been overthrown . We 'll know what we 're dealing with .
KENNY: And if this is a move to appease the hard line , then it may just be the bone he needs to regain control of his own house .
RUSK: Whoever carries the message has to hit the nail on the head . Come across as too soft , they 'll push us . Too hard , they 'll be cornered and even more dangerous .
MCCONE: They could pre-empt .
THE PRESIDENT: Bobby . You know Dobrynin best . Bobby nods , taking up the gauntlet .
BOBBY: What do you want ? A good-bye kiss ?
LIMO DRIVER: Hey , Kenny .
KENNY: Hey , Joe . Listen , I 'll take care of him . Go ahead in , grab some coffee . We 'll be back pretty quick .
LIMO DRIVER: You sure ?
KENNY: What 's the matter with you ? Forget how to open a car door ?
BOBBY: I do n't know if I can do this .
KENNY: There 's nobody else I 'd rather have going in there . Bobby looks at him .
BOBBY: Take a left .
KENNY: Because we knew we could do a better jo than everyone else .
BOBBY: You know I hate being called the illiant one . The ruthless one . They guy who does the dirty work . The one everybody 's afraid of .
KENNY: You 're right about the smart part , but uthless , well
BOBBY: Slow down . Smell that ?
KENNY: Smoke .
BOBBY: Just wanted to see for myself . They 're burning their documents . The final duty of an embassy before war
STAFFER #1: Sir , Ambassador Dobrynin is already here . We have him waiting in you office .
KENNY: I 'll whistle up some luck for you .
THE WOMAN: Who are you ?
KENNY: The friend .
BOBBY: Ambassador Dobrynin , we are aware that at this moment your missiles in Cuba are at the brink of operational readiness
DOBRYNIN: Then I fear our two nations will go to war . And I fear where war will lead us . Bobby acknowledges him with a nod .
BOBBY: If the missiles do not become operational , if you remove the missiles , then there will be no war . At this moment , the President is accepting the terms of Secretary Khruschev 's letter of Friday night . If the Soviet Union halts construction immediately , removes the missiles , and submits to U.N. inspection , the United States will pledge to never invade Cuba or aid others in that enterprise . Dobrynin stares at Bobby . Stares hard .
DOBRYNIN: If your Jupiter missiles in Turkey were emoved also , such an accommodation could be reached .
BOBBY: The United States can not agree to such terms under threat . Any belief to the contrary was in error .
DOBRYNIN: You want war
BOBBY: However , while there can be no quid pro quo on this issue , the United States can offer a private assurance . Dobrynin holds his breath .
DOBRYNIN: This private assurance represents the word of the Highest Authority ?
BOBBY: Yes .
DOBRYNIN: And it can be relayed beyond Comrade Khruschev 's ears to the top circles of my government
BOBBY: Of course . Our pledge can be relayed to any government official Secretary Khruschev sees fit to satisfy .
DOBRYNIN: Tomorrow
BOBBY: Tomorrow
DOBRYNIN: Then you must excuse me and permit me to elay the substance of our discussion to my superiors .
THE PRESIDENT: We were just debating who had it worse , us or George Washington and his guys .
BOBBY: He did n't have to worry about nuclea weapons .
THE PRESIDENT: Yeah , but the country did n't even exist as a country yet . It was a mess , and he did n't have a leg to stand on .
KENNY: All he had was his character .
BOBBY: How does a guy get a rep like that ?
THE PRESIDENT: Does n't matter to me . If I went down in history like Adams , I 'd die happy . All they say about him today is
KENNY: he kept the peace .
THE PRESIDENT: You know , we never did control it . Not eally . Not like we think .
HELEN: I saw you out there . You want him to call you back , need you .
KENNY: No . I 'm glad I 'm home . And she knows the worst .
HELEN: How long do we have ? Kenny 's voice breaks .
KENNY: If the sun rises in the morning , it is only because of men of goodwill . And that 's all there is between us and the Devil .
THE PRESIDENT: Hey ! Hey . Okay , that 's enough .
BUNDY: We 've been talking . We can play this ig in '64 . It 's the foreign policy trophy we 've been waiting .
MCCONE: We 've ordered crash reassessment of ou major geopolitical hotspots . We 've got a lot of new clout , and we can run the table on the Soviets . Middle East , Southeast Asia
MCNAMARA: What 's wrong , O'Donnell ?
KENNY: Do n't you understand ? McNamara and Bundy look at him funny .
BUNDY: Understand what ?
KENNY: The sun came up today .
BUNDY: Yeah .
KENNY: It should n't have . But it did .
MCCONE: We were lucky we were able to keep it under control . Kenny looks away , unable to bear it .
KENNY: Every day the sun comes up says something about us .
BUNDY: Says what , Kenny ? Kenny looks back at them .
KENNY: Something amazing .
MCNAMARA: Sure , Ken . I understand . Feels good to win , does n't it ?
BUNDY: See you later , Kenny .
THE PRESIDENT: Kenny
KENNY: You know The President looks at him in the mirror .
FOR EDUCATIONAL: PURPOSES ONLY
TOBY: Well , I mean it . I 'm serious I do . You promise and promise , and then you change your mind , just like that .
CAROLINE: Uh-huh .
TOBY: You wait 'til you ask me fo something . Just wait . See if you get it .
CAROLINE: Toby , hush . Let me just
TOBY: I said for the twentieth time if a person promises somebody something , they ca n't just turn around and take it back .
CAROLINE: Oh , honey , Jesus . Do n't start with that again .
TOBY: Why not ?
CAROLINE: Because I 'm the mother , and I get to tell you what to do every minute of your life 'til you 're eighteen . Seriously , we 've got no money . I ca n't buy you the moccasins .
TOBY: I bet if you 'd promised Roy some moccasins he 'd of got 'em .
CAROLINE: No talk about Roy , okay ? And ditto the moccasins . We , ca n't , afford , them .
TOBY: Yeah , but you did promise
CAROLINE: Sue me . Take me to court . Oh , Toby , I know you 're disappointed , ut
TOBY: Jack . Call me Jack .
CAROLINE: You 're going to drive me to an early grave I 'm never going to make Salt Lake City .
TOBY: Seriously . If a person ca n't get a stinking miserable pair of moccasins , at least he ought to be able to choose his own name and I wan na be called Jack !
CAROLINE: Fine . And you can call me Jeanette . Jeanette Marie .
TOBY: Oh , you 're so stupid sometimes ,
CAROLINE: Goddamn thing .
CAROLINE: Oh , that poor man . There is a pause . Then Toby speaks
TOBY: I hope to hell this is n't some kind of omen .
CAROLINE: It makes a black light that , uh , causes uranium traces to glow .
TOBY: And we just walk along the street and find this glowing uranium ?
CAROLINE: Well , it was everywhere in Moab , they say just like gold in the gold-rush days .
TOBY: But we were too late in Moab , and that guy at the office said nobody 'd found any uranium in Salt Lake City .
CAROLINE: Well , that means we 'll have the place pretty much to ourselves , huh ? Honey , this could be a big eak for us . If this works out , oh , just think we 'll get us a house , get rid of this damn Nash Ambassador no money worries It 'll be like heaven on a June day .
TOBY: It almost makes me want to see Roy he was the only one could make the thing stop overheating . My God , he was boring . Boring and mean you sure got crappy taste in oyfriends .
CAROLINE: I 'd like to burn you to the ground . Let 's go get rich in Salt Lake City !
MAN: You 're pulling my leg , right ?
CAROLINE: No , I came here to look fo uranium .
MAN: My God , lady . If you 're looking for uranium , why did n't you go to Moab ?
CAROLINE: We went there , but everybody 'd eaten us there . We were too late .
MAN: So you came here just on the chance you 'd find uranium ? Listen , you mind me saying something to you might sound rude ? Lady , you got more courage than you got common sense .
CAROLINE: Do n't ask .
TOBY: That mechanic in Colorado said it needed points .
CAROLINE: I know . Do n't tell me what I already know . This thing 's a ottomless pit . I do n't know what to do . No matter how much money I pour into it
WOMAN: I 'd rather be whipped with a belt than have car trouble . 'Course these days I do n't have to worry about that . My husband got laid off at the mill , and they epossessed the car , so whereve I wan na go , I just have to hoof it , you know ? Caroline smiles , then her face changes .
CAROLINE: You do n't have a car ? You want this one ? Shocked , the Woman says
WOMAN: I uh I
TOBY: You 're gon na give our car away ?
CAROLINE: Seriously . It needs points , and it overheats constantly , but you can have it if you want it , ecause my hand to God , I ca n't look at it one more minute .
WOMAN: Well , sure
CAROLINE: Get the bags out . Get the owner 's slip out of the glove compartment . We 're rid of this son-of-a-bitch pink and white albatross . You do n't mind taking a car with a big dent in the passenger door ?
WOMAN: Hell , no . There 's no dent there
CAROLINE: Oh , yes there is !
WOMAN: you really just giving me this car ?
CAROLINE: It 's done . It 's yours . You got yourself a Nash Ambassador ! Let 's go !
TOBY: Yeah , and like Dad used to say , 'We may be broke , but we 're neve poor . ' And later , if we get a house with a big yard , I could get a collie , you know ? One like Lad or Grey Dawn . And someday maybe a palomino . And I 'm going to try harder in school , too
VICE PRINCIPAL: like to give new boys the enefit of the doubt , but this is the second time in two weeks that you 've been in front of me , and I do n't like that . Now I think you better just call your mother and tell her to come down here .
TOBY: She works . She 's working .
CAROLINE: Liar .
TOBY: Gee , thanks a lot , Mom believe them instead of me .
CAROLINE: If you care anything about me at all , you 'll shut up .
TOBY: Yeah , well if you 'd stayed married to Dad none of this would 've eve happened .
CAROLINE: Look , do n't you put that on my ack I ca n't make your fathe call you . I ca n't make you other write you . They dumped you . Yes . But it 's not my fault .
TOBY: Seven . Almost .
CAROLINE: Why did n't you wake me ?
TOBY: I started dinner . The potatoes are frying , and I 'm heating up the hot dogs .
CAROLINE: Hold your mother 's hand .
TOBY: I 'm sorry .
CAROLINE: I know you are , honey . Ah , well it was n't fire , and nobody led , so I guess we 're okay .
TOBY: Who was that ? She closes her eyes .
CAROLINE: We 've got a guest for dinner it 's Roy . He tracked us down .
ROY: I found me a room , but it 's clear the hell and gone 'cross town . And I think I got a jo lined up doin ' tune-ups in a Texaco station . How you like it at Winstead 's ?
CAROLINE: How do you know where I work ?
ROY: I been here almost a week .
CAROLINE: You followed me around ? For a week ? Watching ?
ROY: You like the rifle , Toby ? 'Jack , ' I mean .
TOBY: It 's the best present I ever got . I just love it . I 'm going to pretend I 'm shooting .
CAROLINE: Do n't point that thing at anybody or I wo n't teach you to shoot .
TOBY: It 's not loaded !
CAROLINE: You heard me anybody or any thing .
TOBY: It 's got no bullets , for God 's sake .
CAROLINE: Do n't make me speak to you again .
TOBY: I 'll point it at the sky , then .
CAROLINE: Do n't . Toby 's still up . Roy leans back , smiling , and eyes Caroline .
ROY: You are one sweet thing , baby just the sight of you makes my dick hard .
WOMAN #1: Hi .
TOBY: Hello .
WOMAN #1: My Lord , look at the eyes on him wo n't he be a heartbreake in three , four years ?
WOMAN #2: Bedroom eyes . Toby smiles .
WOMAN #1: You live in the neighborhood , sweetie ?
TOBY: Over there . I wo n't be here long , though , 'cause my dad 's coming to get me .
WOMAN #1: Oh , yes ?
TOBY: Yeah . I 'm gon na live on his anch in Phoenix . The `` Lazy B , '' it 's called .
WOMAN #2: That sounds like fun .
TOBY: It is . I 've got a palomino horse and a collie , and Dad lets us go on hunts all by ourselves . He gave me this Winchester .22 , and last year I shot a mountain lion with it . And Lad that 's my dog found a nest of rattlesnakes one time , and killed all twelve of them
CAROLINE: We sure are .
TOBY: Where ?
CAROLINE: I do n't know . Got any suggestions ?
TOBY: Phoenix .
CAROLINE: Good . I was thinking of Phoenix or Seattle lots of opportunities in both those places .
TOBY: What about your fabulous oyfriends ? What about the fabulous , boring Roy ? Is he coming , too ?
CAROLINE: Not if I can help it . I looked out the window at work today , and he was parked across the street , watching .
TOBY: Roy 's so uncool . So boring .
CAROLINE: You liked him well enough last night . 'Oh , Roy , I just love my rifle so much ! It 's the bestest present ever ! '
TOBY: Oh , shut up . But he 's smiling , completely unbothered .
CAROLINE: Leave it .
TOBY: Even the canned stuff ?
CAROLINE: Leave it !
TOBY: Well , ask him when the next one to Phoenix is .
TICKET SELLER: Tomorrow morning , eleven forty-five .
CAROLINE: What about Seattle ?
TICKET SELLER: Leaves in nine minutes . They look at each other .
CAROLINE: I 've always had a good head for figures , and if I could get my C.P.A . license , I believe we could make a real go of it in Seattle . I 'll advertise fo oommates , and I bet we find us a real cute house to rent .
TOBY: If there 's a big yard , can I get a collie ?
CAROLINE: Sure . Oh , honey , I feel a wind at my back I think this is going to work out good .
TOBY: Yeah like heaven on a June day .
TOBY: Hey , Terry .

MARIAN: And you say he 's getting serious already ?
CAROLINE: Yes , I think . He keeps talking about marriage , keeps saying he wants to meet Toby .
MARIAN: Well , that 's it three dates and you got 'im good .
CAROLINE: I do n't know if I want him She stops as Toby enters the kitchen .
TOBY: Do n't want who ?
KATHY: Little pitchers
MARIAN: Well , it 's the tough guy who ca n't e bothered to go to school .
CAROLINE: Oh , it 's nothing we were talking about Dwight . I told you about Dwight .
TOBY: He the one drives down from the oondocks ? The mechanic ? Dwight . What a stupid name . Dwiiiight . Duhhhhwight . Dwight-tah-h-h-h. Dwighttahhhhh .
CAROLINE: Would you like coffee before we go ? Or a Coke ?
DWIGHT: You know , I believe I could stand a cup of java .
DWIGHT: So you 're Toby .
TOBY: No .
DWIGHT: You 're not Toby ?
TOBY: No .
CAROLINE: Oh , he wants to be called 'Jack . ' It 's so silly ever since he ead Jack London .
DWIGHT: Well , I 'll call him anything he wants . I always say people can call me anything they want , long as they do n't call me late for supper !
TOBY: No .
MARIAN: He might like it if he ever went there and tried it .
TOBY: Oh , have another cookie , Marian keep your strength up .
MARIAN: I 'd like to just yank that nasty tongue of yours out by the roots .
CAROLINE: My son 's decided to try to drive me into an early grave . Truly .
DWIGHT: Who made this ?
CAROLINE: I did
DWIGHT: Well , well , well , all I can say is that you people are pretty lucky to live in a house where oh .
KATHY: I hear you 're invited up to Dwight 's next week fo Thanksgiving .
DWIGHT: Aw , you 'll love it . Great air , great water . For scenery , all you have to do is step outside you front door and open your eyes . And there 's a turkey shoot Thanksgiving Day . Your mom said you might like it , so I signed you up . Toby sits up , eager .
TOBY: Really ? I can shoot my Winchester ? Great ! I bet I could be the one to get the turkey .
CAROLINE: Well , amazing it can sit up and talk like a normal human being . Dwight , we 're going to be late .
TOBY: Okay .
CAROLINE: I mean it , now .
TOBY: I said 'Okay , ' did n't I ?
CAROLINE: Hey , c'mon , maybe the weekend 'll e fun maybe Concrete will be pretty .
TOBY: Oh , Concrete , my favorite town . Welcome to beautiful Concrete !
CAROLINE: And stop that .
TOBY: Stop what ?
CAROLINE: Sometimes I could kill you as free as I could eat a bite .
TOBY: Ditto .
CAROLINE: Please be nice .
TOBY: All right .
DWIGHT: They always show you salmon fighting to get upstream , but they never show you what they look like when they get there .
CAROLINE: It 's pitiful . Awful .
DWIGHT: They 'll spawn , and then they 'll die . They 're dying now .
TOBY: I hope to hell it 's not an omen . Caroline has to fight back a smile .
DWIGHT: So here we go . Welcome to Concrete . Dwight 's home sweet home . Finest people in the whole state of Washington , you ask me . Lots of churches , too . A neighbo of mine says , `` Looking for nice churches , come to Concrete . Looking for sin , go to hell . '' I think that 's funny
DWIGHT: Okay , so that was the living room ; over here is the kitchen I plan on getting all new fixtures in here and down that hall are the three bedrooms and the bath .
DWIGHT: And over there 's where I work .
CAROLINE: How about you guys ? You like it here ? They glance at each other .
NORMA: It 's a little isolated , is all .
DWIGHT: Not that isolated .
NORMA: Well , maybe not that isolated . Pretty isolated , though .
DWIGHT: Aw , there 's plenty to do in Concrete if you kids would take a little initiative . When I was growing up we did n't have T.V . we used our imaginations . We read the classics . We played musical instruments . You show me a bored kid , I 'll show you a lazy kid .
CAROLINE: I did n't know you played an instrument , Dwight . What do you play ?
DWIGHT: Sax . Tenor sax .
CAROLINE: How 's the school here ?
SKIPPER: There is n't one . We go to Chinook .
NORMA: Chinook High .
DWIGHT: It 's a few miles downriver .
SKIPPER: Forty miles .
DWIGHT: Come off it it 's not that far .
SKIPPER: Yeah , I clocked it thirty-nine miles .
DWIGHT: Ah , you 'd bellyache if the goddam school was in your fugging ack yard . Just shut your god- damn pie-hole .
PEARL: I 'm in fifth grade . Nobody seems to care .
DWIGHT: 'Turkey shoot ' is just a figure of speech .
TOBY: There 's no real turkey ?
DWIGHT: No , it 's just regulation pape targets . It 's a test of skill . And , Jack , I just found out yesterday that they wo n't let kids shoot .
TOBY: But you said I could !
DWIGHT: I know , but they got it all screwed up somehow and told me wrong at first .
CAROLINE: Dwight , you did tell him .
DWIGHT: I do n't make the rules , Caroline . If I made the rules , I might make different ones , but I do n't make the rules .
CAROLINE: Wolff . Caroline Wolff .
MAN: You mean you want to enter ? I think it 's against the rules .
CAROLINE: Well , that sign says this is an N.R.A . club , and I 'm a dues-paying N.R.A . member . That gives me the ight to participate in the activities of other chapters .
MAN: You 'll be the only woman shooting .
MAN: That second-place trophy ai n't ad , honey .
CAROLINE: Then you wo n't feel too bad about carrying it home , will you ?
TOBY: I did n't know you were a member of the N.R.A .
CAROLINE: I 'm a little behind in my dues Thirty-six years behind .
NORMA: What gives ?
TOBY: Mom won the turkey shoot .
NORMA: Oh , boy . Now we 're in for it he thinks he 's some kind of big hunter .
PEARL: Well , he killed a deer once .
NORMA: That was with the car . They all laugh .
DWIGHT: I got just one thing to say . I 'm sitting at the table with the est damn shot in the county !
CAROLINE: So what do you think ?
TOBY: They 're okay . What 's that bald spot on Pearl 's head ? Ugh .
CAROLINE: Some sort of infection .
TOBY: Norma 's nice .
CAROLINE: They 're all nice , but Dwight keeps ushing me , keeps talking about marriage . And I do n't really want to get married not now anyway .
TOBY: That 's fine with me . I wish you would 've stayed married to Dad .
CAROLINE: Oh , do n't wish Duke back on me . God .
TOBY: That woman he married ? Is she eally rich ?
CAROLINE: Like King Midas . Okay , look , we 'll go back to Seattle and see how things go . I 've been thinking about taking a course in stenotyping . A court reporter 's pay is real high . Kathy got engaged , so either I find us another roommate or I 've got to make some more money . And this stenotyping thing sounds just ight . This could turn out good , honey .
TOBY: I mean I blew it off , man I lew his fuckin ' turkey 's head off .
TERRY TAYLOR: With a .22 .
TOBY: Fuckin ' A. Winchester .22 . Pump .
TERRY TAYLOR: Wolff , you are so full of shit .
TOBY: Do n't believe me see if I care .
TERRY TAYLOR: All a .22 bullet would do is make a hole in his head . Toby takes a drag on his cigarette .
TOBY: One bullet , maybe .
TERRY TAYLOR: Oh . Oh , I see you hit the turkey more than once . While he was flying . In the head .
KATHY: exactly what I wanted for my dress . It 's a Simplicity pattern , and I 'm pretty sure I can make it myself . It 's got big puff sleeves
TOBY: Oh !
CAROLINE: What did he do ?
MR. SHIPPY: He violated the school property and flouted the law .
CAROLINE: Can you say that in English ?
MR. SHIPPY: He wrote obscene words on the wall .
CAROLINE: Did you do it ? He did n't do it .
MR. SHIPPY: He wrote obscene words on the wall .
CAROLINE: What obscene words ?
MR. SHIPPY: 'Fuck you . '
CAROLINE: That 's one obscene word . Mr. Shippy looks stymied . There is a pause .
MR. SHIPPY: Look , Mrs. Wolff , Jack 's teachers , like him but they think he 's fallen in with the wrong kind of friends . Is that nicotine stain on you fingers ? I hope not . Let me tell you a story I started smoking in college . Two packs a day . I ate 'em . One night I went to have a cigarette and lo and behold , the pack was empty . I went downstairs and started to rummage through the garbage cans . But as I reached down I mean , right down into a garbage can I suddenly thought , 'Whoa . Hold on right there , Buster . ' I went back to my room and to this day I have n't smoked another cigarette .
MR. SHIPPY: Well , back to the point I think two weeks ' suspension .
CAROLINE: So what shall we do ?
TOBY: What do you mean ?
CAROLINE: Ever since Duke and I got divorced , you 're a different boy . I know he never calls you and I could kill him for it but that 's how Duke is . And Gregory 's in Princeton now , so I guess So what shall we do ? Because this is n't working . We barely have enough money , Kathy 's moving out , and on top of it all , you 've gone wild . You lie
TOBY: No I don '
CAROLINE: Yes , you do . You steal from Marian 's purse I just ca n't handle you anymore , and it scares me . I do n't know what to do . So , you tell me what to do .
TOBY: I can be better . I will be . And I hate the way I am anymore ! I do n't know why I do it ! What about that stenotyping thing you were gon na do ?
CAROLINE: It wo n't happen . It wo n't happen . It wo n't happen . Things are n't going to turn out well , things are n't going to start looking up , and it 's never going to be like heaven on a June day . There is no uranium . There is no stenotyping . There is no C.P.A . license . There is n't
TOBY: What are you going to do , just give me away to him ?
CAROLINE: If you two can get along , if it works out , then I guess he and I might get married .
CAROLINE: I ca n't think of anything else to do . But first I want you approval . Again the two stare at each other .
TOBY: All right . Caroline nods , turns away .
CAROLINE: I put in both your sweaters . You wear them now , the nights are so chilly up there .
TOBY: Okay . I will .
CAROLINE: You do n't have to go if you do n't want to , honey .
TOBY: No , it 's okay . I 'll go .
DWIGHT: Go get it the pelt 's worth fifty bucks , minimum .
TOBY: That thing 's probably got rabies
DWIGHT: Get it !
TOBY: I 'm a little sick to my stomach .
DWIGHT: Sick to your stomach ? A hotshot like you ?
TOBY: I 'm not a hotshot .
DWIGHT: That 's what I hear . I hear you 're a real hotshot . Come and go where you please , do what you please . Is n't that right ? Yeah , regula man about town . Performer , too . That right , Jack ? You a performer ?
TOBY: No , sir .
DWIGHT: That 's a goddamned lie .
TOBY: I 'm not a liar .
DWIGHT: Sure you are . You or Marian . Is Marian a liar ? She says you 're quite the little performer . Is that a lie ? You tell me that 's a lie and we 'll drive back to Seattle so you can call her a liar to he face . You want me to do that ?
TOBY: No .
DWIGHT: Then you must be the one 's a liar , ight ? And you 're a performer ?
TOBY: I guess .
DWIGHT: You guess ? You guess ? Let 's see your act . Go on . Do your act . I 'm waiting .
TOBY: I ca n't .
DWIGHT: Sure you can .
TOBY: No , sir .
DWIGHT: Do me . I hear you do me .
DWIGHT: I know you think you 're bette than me . Caroline told me all about your rich daddy and you prep-school brother , but you fancy days are over you 're a Concrete boy now . I 'm gon na give you a big injection of Concrete . That 's right inoculate you . Oh , my , yes . You 're gon na find out that in Concrete we have to e able to do more than sing Fats Domino songs , we work
NORMA: You 'll be in Miss Graham 's class ?
TOBY: Yeah , is she nice ?
NORMA: She 's okay . She 's pretty .
TOBY: I hate changing schools .
DWIGHT: Speaking of changing , I had a talk with Jack on the way up here , and he says he wants to be a bette oy . And that 's good , 'cause things were n't going well for him in Seattle the police actually came to his house to talk to Caroline about him . Uh-huh , the police .
PEARL: Criminal .
DWIGHT: So here 's what I think I think idle hands are the devil 's workshop , and so I found our Jack a little something to do . I picked up two barrels of horse- chestnuts in the park . You can spend your evenings hulling 'em . And I enrolled you in the Boy Scouts , and you 've got a pape oute , starting Monday , every afternoon from three to six-thirty pays fifty-five bucks a month . What d'you say ? Toby glances around the table , he is subdued .
TOBY: I 'll do it . I want to be better .
DWIGHT: That 's what I like to hear . Okay , you guys get these dishes cleaned up . Let 's show Jack how we do it in Concrete .
MISS GRAHAM: 'Of course I prayed and did God care ? He cared as much as on the air a bird had stamped her foot and cried , `` Give me '' . ' Now . What is the tone of this short poem ?
GIRL: Is it religious ?
MISS GRAHAM: No even though it talks about God , I would n't say it was eligious .
BOY: It 's sad .
MISS GRAHAM: Well , closer , maybe . But no .
TOBY: It 's angry , sort of bitter .
MISS GRAHAM: Very good , Jack . Bull's-eye .
DWIGHT: 'cause I do n't believe that crap , you know ? I believe there is such a thing as a bad boy ad clear through . And it 's gon na e my job to turn you around , to kill or cure . Kill . Or . Cure . Understand ? And I 'm up to the job , oh yes , believe me , hotshot , I am ready , willing and able to take you on you and that jibagoo music you like to sing . I 'm just the guy to knock that music out of your head and put in some respect and obedience . Now your mother has just about washed her hands of you that 's obvious , 'cause she 's shipped you off up here . I mean , she has had it with you . She told me she said 'Dwight , I just ca n't handle him anymore . ' So do n't go crying to Mama , 'cause Mama wo n't listen . Mama is sick to death of her baby oy .
NORMA: You remind me of that boy in the fairy tale who had to spend twenty years sifting sand to find a golden needle . Remember that one ?
PEARL: That 's no fair . You make me sick . I do n't know why you have to live here , anyway . Daddy says we should think of it like you were a charity kid .
TOBY: Wan na comb your hair , Pearl ? Pearl covers her bald spot with one hand .
PEARL: We 're gon na have snowcream !
DWIGHT: heard there was a fresh snow this morning , so I drove up to the mountains . I stopped in a field where it was all clean . I was finished packing it up high when somebody said This 's private property , in case you 're interested . I turned around and there was this woman Yechh ! Ugliest woman I ever saw ugly as a madman 's ass she was . And frowning on top of it . Everybody laughs .
NORMA: Oh , Daddy !
DWIGHT: She was !
TOBY: You 're ugly as a madman 's ass .
PEARL: No , you are .
SKIPPER: What 'd you say to the ugly woman ?
DWIGHT: I did n't say nothin ' I ran .
TOBY: Really ?
PEARL: Can I join the Girl Scouts ?
DWIGHT: I 'm getting one for me , too . Do n't believe in doing anything halfway . If you 're serious about the Scouts then I want you to do it right . We 'll do it right together .
TOBY: Boy 's Life ?
DWIGHT: It 's the official Scout magazine . Tells about what it means to be a Scout , what kind of boy you need to be , and , oh , about merit badges and stuff like that . Toby opens the book at random , reads from it .
TOBY: 'Suggested good turns a Scout can do assist a foreign boy with some English grammar . Help put out a burning field . Give wate to a crippled dog . ' I could do those .
DWIGHT: Hell , yes , you could . You 're a ight kid . I want this Scout thing done right , okay ? Toby nods , enthusiastic , happy .
TOBY: I 'm not going .
DWIGHT: Shut your pie-hole . You look fine .
TOBY: I look like an idiot .
DWIGHT: You act like an idiot , you look fine .
TOBY: You said you 'd get me a new uniform .
DWIGHT: I said I 'd try to get you a new uniform . Beside , this one is new new to you .
TOBY: But look at the sleeves and how it hangs down between my legs !
DWIGHT: Oh piss and moan all you can do is piss and moan .
TOBY: Yeah , piss and moan I notice you 're all jazzed up in new stuff .
DWIGHT: They did n't have second-hand uniforms in my size .
TOBY: Oh , yeah , pull the other leg , it 's got bells on it ! Toby throws himself down on the sofa .
DWIGHT: And what 're you gon na tell Caroline this weekend ? You gon na say you would n't join the Scouts ecause him did n't wike his widdle uniform ?
TOBY: All right , but this stinks . Toby walks outside . Dwight follows .
DWIGHT: Hotshot , you do n't know it yet , ut me and Concrete are in you lood . We 're going to make a man of you yet and in years to come you 'll thank me . You 'll emember me . Me and Concrete .
CAROLINE: Oh , I missed you !
TOBY: Me , too .
CAROLINE: You look good . How are you ?
TOBY: I 'm okay . I 'm fine .
CAROLINE: I said to hell with the budget and ought a roast . I made dumplings God , what 's wrong with your hands ?
TOBY: It 's just juice from some chestnuts it 'll wear off .
CAROLINE: I hope so . My , your hair 's short .
MARIAN: Well , it 's done him a world of good to be up there with you .
DWIGHT: Oh , we have us some pretty good times . Do n't we , Jack ? Have us some good times ? Toby , not looking away from the radio , nods .
CAROLINE: How is it in Concrete ?
TOBY: It 's fine .
CAROLINE: School ?
TOBY: School 's school . My grades are okay .
CAROLINE: You have n't been in any trouble ? Good . How 're you and Dwight ?
TOBY: He made us all snowcream , like he said .
CAROLINE: Stop that , honey .
TOBY: What ?
CAROLINE: Well , you 've got your eyes out of focus . Look at me . Now , are things all right ?
TOBY: I 'm fine .
CAROLINE: You swear ? You act odd .
TOBY: No , I 'm fine .
CAROLINE: Well , good . I 'd feel awful if it had n't worked out . A pause .
TOBY: I think it 's the best thing .
CAROLINE: I think it 's the best thing , too .
TOBY: Hungry . He makes another sign .
DWIGHT: Now that 's a song . Not all this Elvis Presley shit . Elvis sings about like I do brain surgery .
TOBY: It 's so white .
DWIGHT: I got a good deal on this paint . It 'll darken up when it dries .
TOBY: Yeah , but it makes everything else look so dark . Dwight 's face changes . He has an idea .
DWIGHT: Sort of stands out , does n't it ?
TOBY: Yeah , you could say that .
CAROLINE: Oh ! Oh , I 'm so sorry do n't know what 's the matter with me you 're right it does look clean
DWIGHT: M-m-m . There 's not a straight line on you everything 's curved .
CAROLINE: Oh , Dwight , not like that . Not this time not tonight .
DWIGHT: It 's good this way .
CAROLINE: But I want to see your face while we make love .
DWIGHT: Oh , no I just do n't uh like that way .
CAROLINE: You mean you do n't like to make love face to face ?
DWIGHT: No , I do n't like it . I ca n't handle it I do n't like to see the face .
CAROLINE: You mean ever ?
DWIGHT: Look , you can get it doggie-style or you can get it laying on you side those are your only choices . This is my house , and I get to say . Wherever McGinty sits is the head of the table , you know ?
NORMA: Happy Wedding Breakfast !
TOBY: So how 's the bride ?
CAROLINE: Do n't .
TOBY: The bride does n't want to chat ?
CAROLINE: Stop it .
TOBY: Well , the bride is sure snotty this morning .
OSCAR: Arthur Gayle .
JIMMY: What a homo .
TOBY: He sure walks like a girl .
JIMMY: And runs like one and talks like one and throws like one . Probably takes a pee like one too just squats right down .
TOBY: He smarted off to me the othe day told me I was a bourgeois .
JIMMY: What the frig 's a bourgeois ?
OSCAR: Call him a sissy .
TOBY: Why ?
OSCAR: Just see what he says .
JIMMY: Yeah , do it .
ARTHUR: Oh , my , my look at all that yellow Did n't your mama teach you to wash your hands after you pee ?
TOBY: Oh , shut up .
ARTHUR: Now that 's what I like an insult with some originality . Did you just make that up ? Just now ? So clever .
TOBY: Why do n't you take a long walk off a short pier ?
ARTHUR: Excuse me , but has anyone ever told you your breath would gag a maggot ? Both of Toby 's friends laugh .
TOBY: Well , at least I 'm not a great ig sissy !
ARTHUR: Take it back .
TOBY: Okay .
ARTHUR: Say it .
TOBY: Okay . I take it back .
ARTHUR: No , say 'You 're not a sissy . '
TOBY: You 're not a sissy .
CAROLINE: I wo n't do it , you know . I wo n't e a referee between the two of you .
TOBY: Who asked you ?
CAROLINE: You both do . You do . Just by coming home like this you ask me to take your side when he raises hell .
TOBY: Oh , the bride is calm . Who the hell cares ?
CAROLINE: seems like this place is so ugly . Seems like everywhere I look there 's something ugly .
DWIGHT: Who won ?
TOBY: Uh , well , uh he 's the one ca n't see out of one eye .
DWIGHT: Hot damn ! You actually gave little Lord Gayle a black eye ?
TOBY: Well , it was n't black yet .
DWIGHT: But it was all puffed up ? Then it was a shiner .
DWIGHT: How 'd it start ?
TOBY: I called him a sissy . Dwight hoots with laughter and slaps his leg .
DWIGHT: Well , he sure 's hell ca n't sue you for slander . That boy fights fo the pink team . Did you make him cry ?
TOBY: Well he was just ready to . I called him a big-assed , squat- to-pee sissy . I 'd have won bigger except he hit me when I was n't looking .
DWIGHT: He dry-gulched you . Now that 's your fault . You got ta keep you guard up . There 's no excuse fo getting dry-gulched . I 'll show you a couple moves after suppe that 'll leave Miss Arthur Gayle wondering what month it is .
DWIGHT: So I say , 'Excuse me , but what 's the problem ? ' And he starts in on me again , blah , blah , blah , and I jam a horse turd right into that ig mouth . Then I give him a sucker punch in the breadbasket , and he goes down like a Dwight goes on , relishing the story .
CAROLINE: not good , to tell you the truth not good at all . No , he 's not mean to me No , he 's good about that comes home right after work every night . Oh , Marian , I do n't know maybe I just got my hopes too high , although I do n't think so . All I want is a little a little son-of-a-bitching sweetness . That 's all . You think so , huh ? You always did have an eye for Dwight , did n't you ? The thing is , he 's out on the porch teaching Jack to box right now . I keep thinking if I can hang on , things 'll settle down . If I can just hang on long enough , it 'll work out and my kid 'll have a father . You know ?
TOBY: You said you 'd show me how to dry-gulch somebody .
DWIGHT: Okay . Now you can always kick somebody in the balls , but I like this one better What you do is hit 'em in the throat with the side of your forearm . You wait 'til hah !
DWIGHT: Now that 's dry-gulching . Hit 'em in the throat , but do it before they 're expecting it . Now you try .
TOBY: I 'm afraid I 'll hurt you .
DWIGHT: You wo n't .
TOBY: But I might .
DWIGHT: Come onnn . You 're not trying .
TOBY: You just about got dry-gulched , my man .
CAROLINE: I know you may think this is silly , Dwight , but it seems like I do n't know , like an emblem or something . I want to e able to see your face when we make love . How else can we be cl
DWIGHT: You just do n't know what 's good , Sugar . You 're too tense . You just relax and Dwight 'll take you on a little trip . Okay ? You 'll have a good time . Caroline closes her eyes .
TOBY: but ask him again , why do n't you ? I hate it so much .
CAROLINE: I asked him a week ago , I asked him this morning he wants you to keep the paper route .
TOBY: Then make him give me the money . It 's mine , I earned it . It 's $ 220.00 already .
CAROLINE: He wo n't . He says he 'll keep it for when you really need it .
TOBY: That 's not fair . I ought to be able to have my own money . But it 's mine .
CAROLINE: You remind me of a baby bird you know those frantic little things with their mouths wide open , wanting , wanting .
TOBY: Well , at least ask him about my gym shoes again . I can practice arefoot but for games I got ta have shoes .
CAROLINE: I 'm not a referee . I wo n't do it .
TOBY: Oh , we know , we know the bride wo n't argue . The bride wo n't aise her voice .
CAROLINE: Well , I 'll tell you what the bride will do the bride will get up and walk over there and slap hell out of the bride 's son . Now does the bride 's son want his face slapped ?
TOBY: Oh , I hate it here ! I wish we could just get up and go .
CAROLINE: I do n't have another 'get up and go ' left in me ! You understand ? I 'm telling you I 've hit a god- damn wall . I ca n't run anymore . Now this whole thing is n't perfect for me , either let me impress that on you real strong , okay ? I do n't wake up singing every morning . But I 'm going to make this marriage work I wo n't join in any fights , you got that ? I wo n't even raise my voice ! Caroline points to the sink .
TOBY: Big deal .
CAROLINE: I 'm trying to concentrate on the good stuff .
NORMA: What d'ya think ? I think I look like a fool . Who cares ? Six weeks to graduation , and California , here I come !
CAROLINE: Seriously you have to concentrate on the good stuff .
CAROLINE: Try to find the good stuff , honey .
TOBY: I 'm telling you I did n't .
DWIGHT: And I know damn well you did .
TOBY: Well , you 're wrong .
DWIGHT: About some things , yeah . Not about this . You 're a goddam hog , and I proved it .
TOBY: How do you know Skipper did n't eat it ? Or Norma ? Or Pearl ?
DWIGHT: I told all three of them to stay away from this candy for twenty- four hours .
TOBY: Well , how do you know I even ate any ?
DWIGHT: I counted them . You hogged down eleven chocolate covered cherries since yesterday afternoon .
TOBY: So what ?
DWIGHT: So that makes you a hog . I just wanted to establish that fact , and now I have .
SKIPPER: Oh , Dad
DWIGHT: Oh , Dad !
TOBY: Why do n't you ever take up for me ?
DWIGHT: Why do n't you ever help me straighten that boy out ?
TOBY: Oh , big , big deal , who cares , and as long as we 're passing out news here , I do n't want to do my pape oute anymore .
DWIGHT: I bet you do n't big lazy candy hog like you 'd rather lay on his ass and read , would n't you ? Let me tell you something you 're gon na deliver those papers if I have to walk behind you with a horsewhip ever ' step of the way .
TOBY: Then give me the money I earn !
DWIGHT: Hell , no . I 'm putting that in the ank for you for when you really need it cuss me now , thank me later .
TOBY: Mom , wo n't you at least make him let me have the shoes for gym ? How can I play basketball without gym shoes ? I 'm the only one who
DWIGHT: I , well , no , it 's not that I just want you to be well-behaved . Your rich daddy 'Duke ' does n't care anything about you , and so somebody 's got to train you , and one of the things you 've got ta be trained about is not to be a hog and eat everybody 's candy like a Dwight stops short as Caroline says one word .
CAROLINE: Oh .
DWIGHT: What 's the matter , honey ?
CAROLINE: Oh .
DWIGHT: Jack , I think you 've made you mother nervous , so why do n't we just go on to Scouts and let he est ? You lay down and rest awhile .
TOBY: Bastard . Swallow that .
BOY: Give my pud a big squeeze while you 're at it , why do n't you ?
ARTHUR: You like my dog ?
TOBY: Yeah , he 's nice .
ARTHUR: Smart , too he can talk .
TOBY: Sure I just about believe you .
ARTHUR: Hey , Pepper what 's on a tree ? As PEPPER BARKS TWICE
TOBY: That 's dumb . A little funny , though . How come your dad neve comes to meetings with you ?
ARTHUR: I do n't have a dad . Never did . I sprang full-blown from my mother 's forehead . You want to walk home with me and Pepper ?
TOBY: Sure compared to a ride home with Dwight , it 'll be like heaven on a June day .
ARTHUR: Tobias ? Your real name is Tobias ? Toby Tobias I like it it 's very elegant .
TOBY: Every day of my life feels like a mile on the Bataan Death March .
ARTHUR: I knew I 'd like you .
TOBY: Why 'd you point at me that day ?
ARTHUR: Because you 're an alien . You do n't elong in Concrete any more than I do . This place would like to kill us because we 're different .
TOBY: Oh , come on , Arthur . That 's a little dramatic .
ARTHUR: Think so ? You know what chickens do if one chicken 's born with a little difference ? With a few lack feathers on its head , say ? They peck at the black spot 'til the chicken 's dead they ca n't stand the fact that it 's different . Now we 're both different . Your difference is something other than my difference But we 're both aliens here .
TOBY: I do n't exactly feel like an alien . I 've got friends here .
ARTHUR: Yes , and they 're fools . And you act like a fool when you 're around them . A prediction if you stay in Concrete , you 'll wind up working at the A & P either that or you 'll go on a rampage with a hunting rifle .
TOBY: Yeah , and you 'll wind up a recluse that everybody says likes to dress up in his mama 's old clothes .
ARTHUR: Maybe , maybe , but no matter how many times I have to repeat my primary goal 's to get out of Concrete .
TOBY: Burma-Shave !
DWIGHT: Yours .
TOBY: Mine ?
DWIGHT: You said you wanted a dog .
TOBY: A collie , though . Not this one .
DWIGHT: Well , he 's yours . You paid for him . Go get ready for Norma 's play .

CAROLINE: All right . Okay , Dwight . You stay here . Do n't come inside .

CAROLINE: Get his rifle back .
DWIGHT: Am I supposed to go clear to Seattle just to get
CAROLINE: Get his rifle back .
DWIGHT: Jesus Christ , woman , I do n't even know the guy 's last name . Caroline picks up a bowl .
CAROLINE: Well , I did it and the bride did n't even raise her voice he says he 'll get the rifle back as soon as the guy who sold him the dog sends the papers .
CAROLINE: 'Course , having seen that dog , I would n't suggest you hang by you thumbs 'til those papers come . I mean , that dog is ugly .
TOBY: Oh , Mom , ca n't we leave here ? I hate it so much . You do n't like it either all you do is stick your head in a sewing machine night and day . Let 's just leave and start over someplace else .

CAROLINE: Seriously , though give the place a chance . Give him a chance .
TOBY: Great . Just great . What a life I got ta live with Dwight I got a sissy for a new best friend
CAROLINE: Well , look on the bright side You got a dog .
DWIGHT: If you can tear yourself away from your pedicure , I want you to fetch me some of that paint from the attic . Dwight switches the room light off .
TOBY: Yeah .
DWIGHT: Is now too soon .
TOBY: God !
DRIVER: That your car in the ditch back there ? How 'd you do that , anyway ?

TOBY: Yeah , I slept about four hours .

DWIGHT: I was downtown with Champ a few minutes ago , and I met a guy who ecognized him . Said he 'd seen my dog this very morning . Told me an interesting story of how he and the dog happened to meet . What d'you think about that ?

CAROLINE: Oh , honey , good news Truman 's going to campaign for him . I gave twenty-five dollars to his campaign office today . I 've been thinking I 'd like to work She is interrupted by Dwight 's voice O.S .
DWIGHT: So the S.O.B . had been on my ack for a week at work , okay ? Sayin ' I stole his wrench , an ' poured oil all over his tools , as if ! Anyway , he went just one step too far with old Dwight , okay ? Spat on the floor as I walked by . I turned around and walked back to him , acting so dainty and humble and scared , you know , all innocent and the minute he took his eyes off me , BLAM , I dry gulched him ! I shut his water off good ! Never gave me anothe second 's grief to this very day .
CAROLINE: I heard Kennedy on the news again tonight I do n't know I hate the Democrats and the Republicans , ut then once in a while somebody comes along who does n't seem like a liar .
DWIGHT: Kennedy the senator from Rome .
CAROLINE: He gives me hope .
DWIGHT: I know what he gives you , and it sure as hell is n't hope .
CAROLINE: It 's true he is attractive ! And it may just be those white teeth that I respond to . But I do n't think so . I 'm going to work for his campaign .
DWIGHT: No . Too many Republicans in this town . They hear my wife 's working for the Democrats , they 'll take their cars someplace else to be fixed . Bad idea . No .

ARTHUR: What about your grades ? And what would you use for money ?
TOBY: I do n't know . Dwight owes me over twelve hundred bucks ! If I had n't let him keep my pape oute money , I 'd be okay .

ARCH: Nobody in your family ever even een in a Corvette , let alone owned one .
CHUCK: You wait and see if I do n't get one . I 'm gon na move down to Seattle , get a job at Bendix and drive a 'Vette to work every day .

CAROLINE: What is it ?
TOBY: I called Gregory at Princeton . He 's sending me applications fo prep schools . I need you to take me to Seattle to take some entrance exams .
CAROLINE: Would a prep school take you with , uh , your school record ?
TOBY: I 've got to get out of here , Mom . I 've got to . I 've got to get away .
CAROLINE: When are the tests ?
TOBY: Saturday .
CAROLINE: You 'll be there .
TOBY: He wo n't let you have the Buick .
CAROLINE: You 'll be there !
TOBY: Hard . I think I did okay . I 'll know Monday .
CAROLINE: Take that trash out for me , honey . Toby grabs the trash and exits .
TOBY: My application forms must 've come today , and he threw them away .
DWIGHT: Hey , I thought I was helping him thought I 'd save him some trouble 'cause he 's got no chance of getting into some fancy prep school .
CAROLINE: You 've always got your nose pressed up against the bake shop window , do n't you , Dwight ?
DWIGHT: What ?
CAROLINE: You feel like everybody else is inside , and you 're stuck on the outside . It turns you mean . It turns you ugly . And one day do you hear me , Dwight ? One day all that ugliness is going to snap ack and hit you in the face .
DWIGHT: Ooooooh , oh , I 'm so scared . Oooh .
ARTHUR: I wo n't do it .
TOBY: But why ? You work right in the office nobody 'll ever know .
ARTHUR: I 'm surprised you 'd want help from anybody who fights for the pink team .
TOBY: I 'm asking you to help me , man . I got word yesterday that I did eally well on those tests but that 's not enough . I 've got to cheat and lie but I do n't care this is my one chance to get out of here !
ARTHUR: No . Why should you get to be the one ? Why not me ?
TOBY: You could leave too , you know .
ARTHUR: No , I 've grown progressively fond of Concrete . I think I 'll stay here all alone and dress up in my mama 's old clothes sometimes like you said .
CAROLINE: Come help me stuff envelopes .
TOBY: I 'll do some this afternoon .
CAROLINE: No , I need to take them with me .
TOBY: I 'll be in in a minute . Let me finish this article .
CAROLINE: Boy , you irritate me . I think maybe you ought to Yeah I think maybe you should just
PEARL: 'You got letters from those schools ! '
CAROLINE: Maybe that last school will come through .
DWIGHT: Yeah , or maybe he 'll get a contract in the mail asking him to be a singing star on T.V . Well , he 's got about as much chance of one as of the other . Toby gets up and leaves .
TOBY: A Concrete boy .
MANAGER: We only take boys who really want to work hard . Is that you ? I 'd want you to start evenings now , and I 'd want you all summe no vacations . Food service work is n't easy . It 's not something that comes to you in a year or two . So . You think you have what it takes to e an A & P management trainee ?
TOBY: That 's exactly what I 've got .
PEARL: I ca n't find where this green piece goes it 's got ta be grass .
CAROLINE: Do n't go off without eating .
TOBY: I 'll get a sandwich after work .
DWIGHT: I was trying to listen to a ecord .
PEARL: `` Yeah , he 's here , ''
TOBY: Hello ? All right . Tomorrow , then . Goodbye . Toby hangs up , turns to Caroline , quietly
MR. HOWARD: Well , you 're probably bored . Not eing challenged . Your application was very good , Toby , but we have many boys who want to go to Hill . Not everybody is comfortable at a prep school .
TOBY: I think I would be . My fathe and brother went to prep schools .
MR. HOWARD: Is that right ? Where ?
TOBY: Deerfield and Choate . Mr. Howard is impressed .
MR. HOWARD: I see . Well , maybe you 'd like it . Hill was difficult for me , though classes were hard , and the boys seemed cold interested in money and social position . And I hated those snowy Pennsylvania winters ! But then in my last year , something changed . The guys in my class grew close , so close that I still think of them as a second family .
TOBY: I want that . I do , and
ARCH: so she said , 'No , I do n't want you to do that , ' and I said 'Oh , aby , let me get down and grovel on it . ' I mean , I ate her pussy 'til my tongue was calloused , and then
MR. HOWARD: Toby , boys at Hill talk roughly sometimes too you 'd have to e ready for that . I can see you 've had sort of a sheltered life . Toby nods his head .
DWIGHT: Yeah , it 's the guy who thinks he knows everything . Thinks he 's so smart , but fella , what you do n't know would fill a book . General Motors makes shit cars . Dwight turns and enters the drugstore .
TOBY: That 's , uh , that 's this guy he 's a mechanic did some bad work on our car
PEARL: I know something 'll make you feel good that man called you got the scholarship .
PEARL: He said they 're gon na give you two thousand three hundred dollars a year and it costs two thousand five hundred dollars so you got ta come up with the other two hundred . Great , huh ? I 'm making hot dogs I 'll make one for you . Can you put mustard on some bread for us ?
DWIGHT: Hey , leopard . I say , 'Hey , leopard . ' I know you , leopard I can see those spots you ca n't change . Thinks he can go to some fancy prep school and fool everybody . Not a chance . I know a thing o two about a thing or two .
TOBY: I did .
DWIGHT: Why ?
TOBY: Because it was empty .
DWIGHT: Empty ? That look empty to you ?
PEARL: It looks empty to me .
TOBY: It looks empty to me , too .
DWIGHT: Look again , hotshot . Is it empty ?
PEARL: Dad !
DWIGHT: Now . Now , Mr . Big-Time Prep- School fucker , is it empty ?
TOBY: No , it was n't empty .
DWIGHT: All right clean it out .
DWIGHT: Now . Was it empty ? Slowly he stands up and faces Dwight .
TOBY: Yes !
CAROLINE: Get away from him or I will kill you .
TOBY: I got the scholarship and he went nuts . He 's crazy , and I 'm leaving . I 'm leaving !
DWIGHT: Great . Go !
TOBY: Give me my paper route money , and you 'll never have to see my face again .
DWIGHT: That money is gone with the wind . That 's right . I spent it as you made it . It 's gone . Poof .
CAROLINE: It 's not so much that you 're disappointing it 's that you 're consistently disappointing .
DWIGHT: Oh , fancy , fancy talk fancy talk for a whore . I know a thing or two about a thing or two . I got friends in this town that tell me things , and I found out some man down at that campaign headquarters found you a job in Washington , D.C. Gon na run off with him , are n't you , Miss Whore ?
CAROLINE: He 's just a friend .
DWIGHT: Miss Liar . Miss Whore Liar .
TOBY: I 'm leaving , Mom . You can leave , too . You do n't have to stay here .
CAROLINE: I do n't , do I ?
TOBY: No , you do n't .
CAROLINE: I could leave with you , could n't
I?: TOBY Yes , you could !
DWIGHT: What about me ?
CAROLINE: I could just walk right out that door , could n't I ?
TOBY: Yes , you could !
CAROLINE: My God the lightness .
DWIGHT: What about me ?
CAROLINE: I 'm leaving , too .
DWIGHT: No .
CAROLINE: Oh , Dwight , why do you want me to stay ? You do n't even like me , not really .
DWIGHT: You 're not leaving !
CAROLINE: Look again , Dwight I 'm already gone .
DWIGHT: you two 've always sided in against me , always thought you were better than me . I tried . I did the best I could . What about me ? Am I supposed to just crawl off in a ditch someplace and die ? I 've always been the nigger . Everybody 's nigger . Ever since I was little .
CAROLINE: Man , oh man .
TOBY: Man , oh man , oh man .
CAROLINE: Well , we 're out .
TOBY: Great , is n't it ?
CAROLINE: Yes . It 's great . And you got the scholarship ! Congratulations , honey .
TOBY: Yeah , I 'm out ! I 'm outta here ! Maybe I 'll crash and burn , but it 's a chance , so I 'm gone ! I 'm history , Histoire . Nobody 's gon na tell me what to do now , nobody . I 'm free as a bird . Sayonara nest . Heaven on a June day !
CAROLINE: Yeah , heaven on a June day
TOBY: What 'd he say about you having a job in D.C. ?
CAROLINE: Oh , Helen found me something in a eal estate office , but
TOBY: So now you can go ! Oh . Oh ! I am so damn glad to get out of this place ! I 'll be in 'fourth form . ' Does n't that sound great ? And if you get a two-bedroom place in D.C. , I can come for vacations and summers . I 'm out . I 'm out !
CAROLINE: My you 've grown , have n't you .
TOBY: Get on the bus .
CAROLINE: I borrowed money from everybody I know it 's the two hundred you need for the tuition , and an extra fifty . Buy yourself a blazer . Oh , God . I 'll miss you . I 'll write you . You sure your hand 's okay ?
TOBY: Get on the bus , Mom .
DEBBIE: Oh Pete ! Oh my god ! This is crazy !
PETE: Oh my god . So incredible . Want to know a secret ? I took a Viagra .
DEBBIE: What ?
PETE: I took a Viagra . Those things totally work . This is awesome . Why do n't I use this every day ?
DEBBIE: What ? What did you do ? Wait . Stop . Debbie gets out of the shower . Pete follows .
PETE: What 's the matter ?
DEBBIE: You just took a Viagra to have sex with me ?
PETE: I thought it would make it better . It was better . It takes some of the pressure off .
DEBBIE: Because you ca n't get hard without a Viagra ? Is it because you do n't think I 'm sexy ?
PETE: I thought you 'd think it was fun for me to supersize it for once .
DEBBIE: That is the worst birthday present you could ever give someone .
PETE: I was just trying to go turbo fo your birthday .
DEBBIE: I do n't want a turbo penis . I like your medium soft one .
PETE: Look , I can get it up . Just not that far up .
DEBBIE: Where did you get this ?
PETE: I got it from Barry .
DEBBIE: What ? You got it from Barry ?
PETE: Why do you care ? This is my dick we 're talking about , not yours .
DEBBIE: We are young people . We do n't need medication to have sex .
PETE: I only took it because it 's you irthday . I thought you 'd like it . Happy fucking fortieth birthday .
DEBBIE: I am not forty ! And I do n't want to have a husband who has to take Viagra to get a hard-on .
PETE: I do n't have to take it every time , ut once in a while
DEBBIE: Fuck forty ! Forty can suck my dick .
SADIE: Your breath smells weird . Pete breathes all over her as he talks .
PETE: Wake up , wake up . Time to get up .
CHARLOTTE: Can I watch Lost ?
SADIE: You ca n't handle Lost . It 's too violent , and you wo n't understand .
CHARLOTTE: If I do n't understand it , why ca n't I handle it ?
SADIE: Because you 're eight .
CHARLOTTE: I can handle it . I 've seen a shark eat a guy on Shark Week .
SADIE: Shark Week is fake .
CHARLOTTE: No , it 's not .
SADIE: All of it is reenactments .
CHARLOTTE: I know but they
SADIE: That 's scary ! You should n't be allowed to watch that .
CHARLOTTE: they show the reenactments but they actually happened .
SADIE: It 's going to give you nightmares .
CHARLOTTE: I can handle a nightmare . You 're a nightmare every day for me .
DEBBIE: Hey . Do n't eat that cupcake .
PETE: What ?
DEBBIE: The one you just put into the sink . I saw you were hiding that .
PETE: This cupcake ? You think I 'm going to eat this cupcake ?
DEBBIE: Yeah .
PETE: I so do n't want this cupcake . Look .
DEBBIE: You 're still going to eat it .
PETE: I 'm going to eat this cupcake ?
DEBBIE: Just put it in the trash .
PETE: What would you like to do today ? Your choice .

PETE: Do n't you want to get a massage ? O do something fun ? Forty 's huge .
DEBBIE: I 'm turning thirty-eight .
PETE: Okay . Thirty-eight . We 'll move on . Is n't it weird that our birthday is the same week and that we 're going to have a party , and it 's just fo me ?
DEBBIE: No . I do n't think it 's weird at all . Because you 're turning forty and I 'm turning thirty-eight .
PETE: Come on . Do you really want to be one of those ladies who 's just so insecure about their age and they lie and then they 've got to emember .
DEBBIE: You do n't get it . You do n't understand how it works . I do n't want to shop at old lady stores . I do n't want to go to J. Jill and Chicos and Ann Taylor Loft . I 'm not eady yet . I need two more years .
PETE: That is so insane , it kind of makes sense .
DEBBIE: What did you get me for my irthday ?
PETE: I thought you said that we should n't get each other gifts this year ?
DEBBIE: What do you mean ? You 're supposed to get me a surprise gift . This is a big birthday . I 'm turning forty !
SADIE: Mom ! Why ca n't I get new clothes ? ! Nothing fits me ! ! God damn it ! !
DEBBIE: I am going to work out . I 'll be ack in about an hour .
PETE: Hey , did your father call to wish you a happy birthday ?
DEBBIE: No . That 's no surprise .
JASON: Come on .
BARB: Coming .
JASON: You 've got to keep up with us , sweetheart . That 's why your body looks like your body and her body looks like her body . Before , after . Before , after .
BARB: You guys just go on without me . I 'm just gon na fuck .
BARRY: Hey , thanks for letting me join this team .
PETE: It 's not really a team , it 's just a unch of guys who get together and ide .
BARRY: I know , I know .
PETE: Bike lane , asshole ! It 's always the guy in the fucking Infiniti .
JASON: So why on earth is Pete taking Viagra ? What 's going on ?
DEBBIE: I do n't know . I think maybe he just is n't attracted to me anymore .
JASON: That is ridiculous . If you were my girlfriend , I would not need a Viagra . I would need an anti-Viagra pill . To try not to get a boner .
DEBBIE: But everyone gives you a boner .
JASON: Do n't sell yourself short like that . You give me a boner . Barb does n't give me a boner .
DEBBIE: Maybe things are just getting stale . That 's why maybe I work out eally hard . Maybe he 'll be able to get a boner again .
BARB: Why do you need to have sex , Deb ? Sex is the number one thing people fight about .
MORE: 9 .
JASON: I knew it . I knew you were not having sex . I can see it on you face . It 's all puckered and pained .
BARB: I 'm enjoying our non-sex period , that 's all I 'm saying .
JASON: Do n't you miss it ?
BARB: Well , I would n't know , because I do n't have any feeling down there anymore . I have nerve damage from my C-section so everything is just kinda-
DEBBIE: She 's numb down there .
BARB: I could sit down hard on a fire hydrant , and I would n't even know that I was sitting . I could get stung by a hornet down there , and I would not feel it . You could put anything in there , and I would not know what the object was . I used to pee in a nice stream , and now it just kind of goes like a showe head .
JASON: That is the saddest thing I 've eve heard .
DEBBIE: I think you need a family . Do n't you want a family ?
JASON: No , I think I want to Clooney it .
DEBBIE: Clooney it ?
JASON: Yup .
DEBBIE: He does n't seem happy .
JASON: Yeah , he is .
DEBBIE: No . He 's lonely .
JASON: No , he 's not .
DEBBIE: See , I think he has sad eyes .
JASON: Aw , you sweet little thing . He 's doing sad , lonely eyes . To get the next lady . I can do it too , watch . Jason demonstrates .
DEBBIE: I bet George Clooney is really lonely . Just him and his pig .
JASON: You 'd fuck him .
DEBBIE: I would n't .
JASON: So would you .
BARB: I would . I would n't feel it but-
JASON: You 'd fuck him with your num vagina . Yes , you would . Ocean 's thirteen inches , that 's what you 'd find out .
DEBBIE: Do you think ?
BARRY: I mean that was idiotic . You have to understand . That 's like the one thing you do n't do is tell her you used Viagra . I think that 's even on the warning label .
PETE: We 're in one of those phases where everything the other person says just annoys the shit out of each other . All the time . It 's a blast .
BARRY: Do n't worry about it . You just got ta ride that out .
PETE: This sounds terrible but do you ever wonder what it would be like if , say , you were separated by something bigger , like death . Like her death ?
BARRY: I have given it a fair amount of thought .
PETE: Not in a painful way . Just quietly slid into death . Like a gas leak .
BARRY: Absolutely . It has got to be peaceful . I mean this is the mothe of your children .
PETE: I 'd want it to be a peaceful just like , drift , into a coma , from which she never awakens .
BARRY: Then you move on . Then you 're a widower .
PETE: That 's just it . People love widowers .
BARRY: They love widowers . It 's like the polar opposite of divorced guys .
PETE: It 's the best .
BARRY: It 's like , oh , that poor widower . You know . If I could only
PETE: Somehow
BARRY: make him happy .
PETE: Somehow ease his pain .
BARRY: cocksuck away his sadness .
PETE: Did you know that the Pixies did this song about a Salvador Dali short film called `` Un Chien Andalou '' ?
DEBBIE: This music does n't make people happy .
PETE: This song kicks off Doolittle , one of the best albums of the last thirty years . An important record .
DEBBIE: Look how angry you get while listening to this . It 's my birthday . You do n't control the radio on my birthday . I control the radio on my birthday .
CHARLOTTE: Sadie 's watching Lost .
DEBBIE: Sadie , how many times have you watched Lost this week ?
SADIE: I 've only watched eleven . I have eight more and then I 'm done .
PETE: How many are there ?
SADIE: A hundred and fourteen ?
PETE: Are you kidding me ? You ca n't watch over a hundred episodes of a show in five weeks . It 'll melt you ain .
SADIE: It 's not melting my brain , it 's lowing my mind .
DEBBIE: That 's really bad , Sadie . You 're not allowed to do that .
SADIE: My relationship with Lost is not your business . It 's extremely personal .
DEBBIE: Be nice to your sister . You guys are going to cherish each other one day .
SADIE: Stop it ! Stop !
PETE: It 's your birthday , you do n't need to go to the store .
DEBBIE: I know , just five minutes . I think Desi and Jodi are fighting .
PETE: All right , five minutes . But then I 'm pulling you out .
DEBBIE: Hi . How 's Jodi treating you ?
DESI: Jodi ? Oh , Jodi 's my new BFF . She 's like a little kitty cat . Sometimes she comes and rubs up against my leg .
JODI: You 're a ball of shit .
DESI: She loves me .
DEBBIE: Huh .
JODI: I think it 's probably Desi . She 's een having a really hard time using these simple computers .
DEBBIE: She 's not stealing . She 's our best employee . She made nine grand last month .
JODI: Well , how much did I make ?
DEBBIE: You brought in twenty-two hundred .
JODI: That 's not bad .
DEBBIE: Well , that 's not that good . I mean , I 'm not comparing you , but you 're not as good . Pete is still staring at Desi on the ladder .
PETE: All right . See you . Pete walks over to Debbie .
DEBBIE: What ?
PETE: It 's all dark up there .
DEBBIE: What ? Why are you looking ?
PETE: I did n't mean to look , I just said , ` Hey- woah ! ' There it was .
DEBBIE: Maybe she 's wearing dark underwear .
PETE: Yeah . Maybe she has underwear that has a picture of a vagina painted on it .
DEBBIE: Stop looking .
DESI: Maybe some deep oranges and browns and maybe dark greens ? That would eally play up your features .
CUSTOMER: I 'll just take out my AmEx and you pick what stuff you think is good .
DEBBIE: Woo ! Where 's daddy ?
SADIE: I think he went to poop .
DEBBIE: Pete !
PETE: Going to the bathroom .
DEBBIE: We 're all downstairs waiting fo you . You 've been up here for a eally long time now .
PETE: Oh , I 'm almost done . I 'll be down in a second .
DEBBIE: Charlotte just did her first flip on the trampoline , and she landed on her feet . She was really proud of herself .
PETE: Oh , that 's great .
DEBBIE: And you missed it .
PETE: She 'll do it again .
DEBBIE: It 's just that this is the fourth time you 've gone to the bathroom today .
PETE: Give me a break .
DEBBIE: Why is your instinct to escape ?
PETE: It 's not my instinct to escape from you . It is my instinct to come into the bathroom when I need to go to the bathroom .
DEBBIE: How come I do n't smell anything ?
PETE: It 's because I shoved an Altoid up my ass before I came in here .
DEBBIE: Let me see then .
PETE: What ?
DEBBIE: Let me see !
PETE: No , I 'm not going to let you see .
DEBBIE: You 're not going to let me see ecause you 're not taking a poop .
PETE: I 've been flushing as I go .
DEBBIE: You 're flushing as you go ? Who takes a half hour to go to the athroom ?
PETE: John Goodman . She angrily grabs his iPad and walks out .
DEBBIE: It 's just not my kind of music .
PETE: Really . What is your kind of music ?
DEBBIE: I like Lady Gaga .
PETE: Oh , god , of course you do .
DEBBIE: What ?
PETE: Shallow dance music .
DEBBIE: It 's not ! It 's fun , and it 's about elease and sex and power .
PETE: You know , you do n't have to like it . It 's really not for you , that 's fine .
DEBBIE: This is a job . This is not a hobby . Ca n't you love him just as a hobby ? And sign a fifteen-year-old hot girl so we can eat ?
PETE: Graham Parker and The Rumour had two albums in the Rolling Stone Top 500 Best Albums of All Time . Two of ` em . If I can just sell ten thousand records to his hardcore fan base , we 're golden . An ambulance drives by , sirens blaring .
DEBBIE: The last of Graham Parker 's fans just died .
PETE: Now , something that really rocks . Pete puts on `` Rooster '' by Alice In Chains .
SADIE: This is bumming me out . This is n't fun .
PETE: Just listen to these words , okay ?
CHARLOTTE: I do n't understand the words .
PETE: This is lyrics , this is poetry . This is what is going to survive in a hundred years .
DEBBIE: It just does n't make people happy .
PETE: It makes me happy . I can dance to it . Pete starts dancing around like it is fun .
DEBBIE: You 're the only one in the room who 's happy . Pete stops his music .
PETE: Sometimes , I wish just one of you had a dick .
CHARLOTTE: Well , we do n't want one .
DEBBIE: Is there something that you can do to be helping me right now ?
PETE: Yeah , I 'm ready to help . Just tell me what to do .
DEBBIE: Can you go get a lunch box o something ?
PETE: For me or for them ?
SADIE: Charlotte ! I 've got a test !
CHARLOTTE: I 'm coming ! I 'm coming !
SADIE: Charlotte , I 'm going to kill you ! Debbie covers Sadie 's mouth .
DEBBIE: Shhh !
BETH: Katie 's dying for a play date . Let 's hook these two up .
DEBBIE: That would be great , I 'll call you . Beth and Katie walk off .
CHARLOTTE: No .
DEBBIE: `` No '' what ?
CHARLOTTE: No .
DEBBIE: What ? She 's sweet .
CHARLOTTE: She 's evil .
TEACHER: Hi . Listen , Charlotte really needs to get here on time because she needs the extra time to just settle in .
DEBBIE: Oh . We are on time .
TEACHER: Being on time means being early .
DEBBIE: Oh . Okay .
TEACHER: Well , it 's nice to see you in class . We 'd like to see more of you .
DEBBIE: I come to
GRANDMA MOLLY: Hi Debbie !
DEBBIE: Hi , Grandma Molly .
GRANDMA MOLLY: How are you ? I 'm so happy about the science fair . It 's going very well I heard . I love you . You look so eautiful . Happy birthday ! I just learned it 's your fortieth . Are you forty ?
DEBBIE: Yeah .
GRANDMA MOLLY: I remember when I was forty , and then I blinked and there I was , going to be ninety . My god , where did it go ? One day you 're going to link , and you 're going to be ninety , and I wo n't be around to see it . And that makes me very sad . I 'm telling you , I 'm warning you . Do n't blink . Do n't blink .
PETE: Oh , god . I ca n't tell Debbie .
RONNIE: What are you doing ?
CAT: I 'm contextualizing him as one of the great figures in rock history .
RONNIE: You ca n't show him in his prime in ` 77 and then jump straight to him as he is now . It 's terrifying . You have to reverse it . You 've got to show him as he is now very briefly , and then show him in 1977 . You have to `` Benjamin Button '' it .
CAT: I do n't know what you 're talking about , okay ? All rock stars are older now . Steven Tyler , David Bowie , Mick Jagger
PETE: Paul McCartney .
RONNIE: Okay , stop it . Everybody you 're mentioning looks like an old woman now . You 're just mentioning a bunch of Jessica Tandys . Keith Richards gets away with it . But that 's ecause Keith Richards looked seventy when he was forty , and now that he 's seventy , he looks sixty- nine . He 's regenerating .
CAT: I like it . And I think Graham Parker is sexy .
RONNIE: Would you fuck him ?
CAT: Yes .
RONNIE: You 'd fuck him , and you wo n't fuck me ?
CAT: I mean , I kind of fucked you once , if you could have finished .
RONNIE: Oh , I finished .
PETE: You know what , enough of who fucked who and who finished what .
RONNIE: I finished .
PETE: Look . It 's a retro label . That 's our niche . That 's our market . It costs money to break new bands , I ca n't do that .
RONNIE: Oh , okay . And also you 're the guy who turned down Arcade Fire .
PETE: Everyone turned down Arcade Fire .
CAT: It 's crazy , there are so many of them !
PETE: We do n't have the money to market a new band . We just need to make Graham seem relevant . Who is he talking to ?
CAT: Um , the Jewish Journal .
PETE: The Jewish Journal ?
RONNIE: Apparently old Jews are the only ones who still buy hard copies of ecords . Because they do n't like to download music . Because they do n't know what downloading means .
GRAHAM: It is n't . Angle on Pete , Cat and Ronnie .
PETE: What is he wearing ?
CAT: It 's a hat with the Oreo logo on it .
PETE: Why ?
CAT: I do n't think he 's being ironic , I think he just really likes Oreos .
PETE: Look . The Paul Westerberg record did okay . Frank Black did all ight . The Haircut 100 , not so much . We have to break this record . Otherwise , we 're not here next year .
RONNIE: He 's coming . Oreo man is coming . Graham walks up .
GRAHAM: Hey guys , how are you ?
RONNIE: Are n't cookies the best ?
GRAHAM: Yeah . Jewish Journal guy loves the ecord .
PETE: Great !
GRAHAM: Got a bit of a problem . Touch of gout .
PETE: Gout ?
GRAHAM: Yeah , my whole family , they all had gout .
PETE: Jesus .
RONNIE: That 's very unfortunate .
GRAHAM: My auntie Queenie , she had a foot like the size of a small pig . I 've got a photo of it .
RONNIE: I 'd love to see that photo of that gout foot .
GRAHAM: A couple of bunions as well .
RONNIE: Fuck .
GRAHAM: I 've got to go to the podiatrist , and I hope he can shoot me up with something .
PETE: Yeah , well , let 's get you to the podiatrist .
CAT: Bye , Graham .
RONNIE: See you later , Graham . Good luck with your gout !
GRAHAM: Rock and Roll , baby .
DEBBIE: The happiest period in people 's lives is from age forty to sixty . So this is it . We 're in it , right now .
PETE: Says who ?
DEBBIE: Says a lot of people , most people .
PETE: Huh .
DEBBIE: We have everything we need right now to be completely happy . We 're going to blink and be ninety .
PETE: What ?
DEBBIE: So , let 's just choose to be happy .
PETE: Yeah .
DEBBIE: Your eyes are kind of glazing over .
PETE: No , I 'm just processing it all .
DEBBIE: Some of these I wrote for you . So , we have to exercise every day . Spend more time alone together . We have to go to the therapist every week .
PETE: That 's a little pricey .
DEBBIE: No stressing over tiny things .
PETE: Yeah , that 's good . You should do that .
DEBBIE: We have to get more involved in school . Have more patience with the kids . And we need to work on ou anger .
PETE: Yeah , I think it would be good if you could take care of your anger .
DEBBIE: No , I said both of us .
PETE: That 's what I said . Our anger .
DEBBIE: Okay . No more smoking .
PETE: Yeah , you 've got to cut that out .
DEBBIE: I do n't want to make this about a fight , I want to just be positive .
PETE: Sorry .
DEBBIE: Okay , and then no more holding on to resentments . We have to just let that go .
PETE: So , you 're saying that if we 're arguing and I apologize , you 'll let it go and not throw it back in my face later ?
DEBBIE: Well , I do n't do that , but I will continue not to do that . What did you write ?
PETE: All of that . That 's plenty . That 's a lot .
DEBBIE: And you 're going to eat better ?
PETE: Oh , yeah . I 've been doing a decent job , but I do n't think there 's anything wrong with having some fries every now and again .
DEBBIE: And then I 'll smoke that day .
PETE: That 's not the same thing .
DEBBIE: It is the same thing .
PETE: I like fries .
DEBBIE: And the other thing is your dad stuff .
PETE: No , I have n't been giving him money for years , I told you .
DEBBIE: Can you please put that down ?
PETE: You sure you do n't want to just do a joint birthday party ?
DEBBIE: No .
PETE: We always used to .
DEBBIE: No .
PETE: Are you serious ?
DEBBIE: Yes .
PETE: How much ?
DEBBIE: Twelve thousand dollars .
PETE: Oh , god . And Desi 's taking it ?
DEBBIE: Well , I do n't know . That 's what Jodi said .
PETE: We really need the store to work .
DEBBIE: It is . Do n't put that kind of pressure on me .
PETE: That 's not what I mean .
DEBBIE: Are you nervous about money ? Are we okay ?
PETE: Yeah . Maybe we just suck it up ecause she 's clearly earning so much more than any other employee we have .
DEBBIE: Oh , yeah . For sure . We ca n't fire her . We 're barely breaking even with her .
PETE: That 's why we have to keep her .
DEBBIE: Look at this , she 's making out with somebody .
PETE: That might be like a dry hump .
DEBBIE: Look at the position of her skirt .
PETE: That 's too grainy to know for sure . Oh my god , this is the middle of the day . Customers could be in there .
DEBBIE: At least she 's getting some .
PETE: What did you say ? `` At least she 's getting some '' ?
DEBBIE: Yes .
PETE: What are you talking about ? We had sex the other night . You have to give me a little credit for that .
DEBBIE: It 's not about credit . We need to have more passion . Like this .
PETE: That 's not passion .
DEBBIE: It looks like passion to me .
PETE: What Pete farts .
DEBBIE: Oh my god . Do n't do that ! Debbie hits Pete with a pillow .
PETE: What am I doing ?
DEBBIE: Do n't fart in the bed !
PETE: I 'm not , it 's the springs .
DEBBIE: This is why we never have sex . That 's disgusting . You 're gross .
PETE: I do n't know what you 're talking about . Pete farts again .
CHARLOTTE: Sadie . Sadie , Sadie ! Sadie , Sadie !
SADIE: Charlotte . I 'm doing my homework .
CHARLOTTE: Okay , watch this . There 's a haunted cow back here , and I 'm pretty sure it does not have milk !
SADIE: Charlotte . How many times do I have to tell you
CHARLOTTE: Sadie ! Sadie , Sadie ! Is boring !

DEBBIE: I grind all night .
DENTIST: I think we need to turn the gas down .

PETE: Yeah , I 'm growing it out .
LARRY: I 'd get it cut .
TRIPLET #1: Daddy , you never play with me .
LARRY: I do but right now look who I 'm talking to . It 's your brother .
TRIPLET #1: You do n't look like my brother .
LARRY: I told you honey , that 's because of the egg donor . Remember ?
TRIPLET #1: I came from a test tube .
PETE: How 's business ?
LARRY: It 's not good . Nobody wants curtains . They think of it like a luxury . It 's not a luxury . You need shade , you need privacy . Who wants to have other people watch you fuck ?
PETE: I know how you feel . You know my usiness is going through some growing pains right now .
TRIPLET #2: Daddy come play with us . The kids crawl around on him .
LARRY: Be careful , do n't jump on Daddy . Remember , Daddy has high blood what ?
TRIPLETS: Blood pressure .
LARRY: That 's right . Can you go outside without me for a little bit ?
PETE: Look , I wanted to talk to you about scaling back a little bit . You know , Deb and I are thinking about selling the house .
LARRY: I think that house is more than you need . I think it was too big of a purchase when you made it .
PETE: Yeah . In the meantime , I 'm going to have to make some changes . Going to have to cut back .
LARRY: What do you mean ?
PETE: With you .
LARRY: Oh . I 'm sorry , what ?
PETE: I ca n't lend you any more money .
LARRY: No , that 's a bad idea . That 's not the way to cut back . I have three children , here .
PETE: What about Claire ? Why ca n't she get a job ?
LARRY: Claire takes care of your brothers . What do you want her to do ? If she goes to work , then I 've got to hire somebody .
PETE: Well you 've got to figure something out because I ca n't do it .
LARRY: Okay , fine . Why do n't we kill them ? Come on , we 'll kill two of them . I 'll keep the best one . Really , it will save us both a lot of trouble .
TRIPLET #1: I do !
LARRY: Okay , we 're eliminating one , we 're cheaper already . Larry sprays him with the hose .
TRIPLET #2: Murder me !
LARRY: Boom , dead . You 're dead .
TRIPLET #2: I 'm dead !
LARRY: All right , the kids are murdered . That will save us some money .
PETE: Why would you have three kids , anyway ? I mean , you 're sixty years old . You have no money .
LARRY: Because Claire wanted a baby . If we did n't at least try , she would have left me . She was forty-five years old . Nobody thought it would take .
PETE: What ?
LARRY: Your mother wanted you aborted .
PETE: Oh , Jesus Christ .
LARRY: It 's the truth . It was the seventies . We were twenty-two years old . That 's what everybody did . You did some blow , had sex , had an abortion .
PETE: Really .
LARRY: Yes . We were on the way to the doctor 's office . I said , `` Let 's stop , have a pizza , talk about it , if you still want to do it afte lunch , it 's okay . '' The pizza saved your life . But do n't give me money . Because I 'm not worth it .
PETE: So how much do I owe you for saving my life ?
LARRY: I do n't have a number . You just keep giving like you 're giving . Larry 's wife , CLAIRE , enters .
CLAIRE: Oh , hi Pete . Why are n't you playing with kids ?
LARRY: We were playing with them all day . Pete 's just talking to me about his fortieth birthday party Whateve I can do to help .
CLAIRE: Okay . Did you feed them ?
LARRY: I fed half of one . Okay , let 's feed them . Who wants tuna with a side of jet fuel ? Larry gets up and walks outside .
DEBBIE: Hi , I 'm looking for my dad , an older man ?
OLIVER: So how 's Sony treating Pete ?
DEBBIE: Oh , he 's not with Sony anymore . He went out on his own . Now he 's able to focus on the artists that he 's eally passionate about .
OLIVER: How 's Sadie doing ? Last time I saw her she was throwing her Cheerios on the floor . What a mess .
DEBBIE: She just got her period .
OLIVER: Well . I guess she 's not a little aby anymore .
DEBBIE: It would be nice to see more of each other .
OLIVER: Well , we can certainly arrange fo that . I 'd love to see the girls .
DEBBIE: That would be nice . Do you have a good day ?
OLIVER: I would say the weekends , but ou weekends are hell . Socce competitions , kids exams . I mean , we 're both so busy . I have young children , you have young children . I do n't think we should judge ourselves too harshly about that .
DEBBIE: I know , I was n't . I 'm glad we 're here . I think this is a good start and that if we can spend more time together , it would be nice .
OLIVER: It would be nice . Do you want to see pictures of the kids ?
DEBBIE: He 's handsome . He 's thirteen ?
OLIVER: Yeah . And that 's Alexandra , my daughter , she 's a real perfectionist . A lot like you . That 's the whole gang at Cabo . Will you excuse me , dear ? I 've got to use the restroom . Be right back .
DEBBIE: Daddy and I are making some changes so that we can be happier and healthier , and we 're starting with this meal that I prepared .
PETE: I think it looks great .
DEBBIE: Does n't it look good ?
PETE: What is that , grilled cheeses ?
DEBBIE: No , baked tofu . It 's actually eally tasty . And the lettuce is so fresh and tasty that you forget how good lettuce tastes on its own without dressing .
PETE: Yeah , dressing always gets in the way of the natural taste of the lettuce .
DEBBIE: And another thing we 've decided is to cut back on all of the electronics we use . What we 're going to do is get rid of the wi-fi and only use the computer from eight to eight-thirty at night .
SADIE: How are we going to go on the computer ?
DEBBIE: We 're going to have a hard line in the kitchen .
PETE: Yeah , we 'll supervise that .
SADIE: You ca n't do this . You ca n't take away the wi-fi .
CHARLOTTE: No wi-fi ! Ha-ha-ha !
DEBBIE: You do n't spend enough time with the family when you 're constantly on your iPhone and your computer . You 're only here five more years .
SADIE: So you wo n't see me after five years ?
DEBBIE: No , but you wo n't be living with us . And you should get to know you little sister .
PETE: You 've got the perfect friend right here .
SADIE: I do n't want to be friends with he now . I 'll be friends with her when she 's twenty and a normal person .
CHARLOTTE: I do n't want to hang out with he when I 'm in my twenties .
PETE: You 're on your computer too much as it is . You need to get outside more .
DEBBIE: Yeah . You can build things . You can uild a fort .
SADIE: What ?
DEBBIE: Yeah , build a fort . Play with you friends .
SADIE: Make a fort ? ! Outside ? And do what in the fort ?
DEBBIE: When I was a kid we used to build tree houses and play with sticks .
SADIE: Nobody plays with sticks .
PETE: You and Charlotte can have a lemonade stand .
DEBBIE: Play Kick the Can .
PETE: Look for dead bodies .
DEBBIE: It 's fun .
PETE: Get a tire and then take a stick and run down the street with it .
SADIE: Nobody does that crap . It 's 2012 .
DEBBIE: You do n't need technology .
CHARLOTTE: No technology !
DEBBIE: Charlotte , put that down .
SADIE: I do n't need to be monitored all the time on the computer . I do n't do anything bad .
DEBBIE: Nobody said you were bad .
SADIE: I do n't do things I 'm not supposed to . I do n't illegally download music . I do n't look at porn like Wendy .
DEBBIE: She is up to no good . She 's not allowed to come over here anymore .
CHARLOTTE: What 's porn ?
PETE: No , she said `` corn . ''
DEBBIE: This is n't turning out the way I wanted it to .
SADIE: I 'm not hungry . Sadie gets up and stomps off .
DEBBIE: No computer .
PETE: Listen to your mom .
SADIE: I need to use it for my homework . She walks off .

PETE: Nah .
DEBBIE: Why do we fight ?
PETE: I do n't know , it makes no sense at all .
DEBBIE: It makes no sense .
PETE: When we get in a fight , look in my eyes . Let 's remember this moment ight now and know that we neve have to fight .
DEBBIE: But you 're such a dick sometimes .
PETE: I know , I am a dick sometimes . People think I 'm so nice , but I 'm such a dick .
DEBBIE: Thank you for admitting that .
PETE: And you get so mad at me . I feel like you want to kill me .
DEBBIE: I do want to kill you .
PETE: How would you do it ?
DEBBIE: I do n't know poison you . I 'd poison your cupcakes that you pretend not to eat everyday . And just put enough in to slowly weaken you .
PETE: I love it .
DEBBIE: I would enjoy our last few months together .
PETE: Me too .
DEBBIE: Because you 'd be so weak and sweet , and I could take care of you but while killing you .
PETE: See ? You know what I love about us ? You can still surprise me . I figured for sure you 'd knock me out with one fell swoop . But you would extend it over a series of months .
DEBBIE: Have you ever thought about killing me ?
PETE: Oh , yeah .
DEBBIE: Really ?
PETE: Sure .
DEBBIE: How would you do it ?
PETE: Wood chipper .

PETE: Let 's eat the cookie , and then we 'll order a bunch of cheeseburgers . Let 's order the entire room service menu .
DEBBIE: Just get all of it . You deserve it . You really do .
PETE: Would n't you rather have me around for less years and I 'm incredibly happy than longer and miserable ?
DEBBIE: Yes , and I just realized that right now . Go get the cookie !
PETE: Should we get a block of porn ?
DEBBIE: I do n't think we need twenty-fou hours of porn .
PETE: Yeah , but you know , two porns cost about as much as a block .
DEBBIE: I think that 's too much porn .
PETE: We do n't have to watch it all , but for the value it makes sense .
DEBBIE: How much are we supposed to eat ?
PETE: I do n't know . I think like six o seven cookies , right ?
DEBBIE: Plus , it 's old . It probably has lost some of its-
PETE: Potency ?
DEBBIE: We should have sex . More .
PETE: I mean , girls have it so easy . You just show up with your sexual organs and you 're good to go . All the pressure is on the guy .
DEBBIE: It 's true .
PETE: And I look at guys , like I look at a guy like Prince , and you know that guy fucks . I know I do n't fuck like Prince . Prince can fuck . I fuck more like David Schwimmer .
DEBBIE: You do .
PETE: I fuck like Ross from Friends . They 're laughing and having a good time .
PETE: How does he do it ? The floating spoon .
DEBBIE: I 'm going to deep throat this eclair . She tries to deep throat it . Pete loves it .
PETE: I want to make out with you so bad .
DEBBIE: That was nice . Sadie walks outside . Jodi follows her .
SADIE: Mom ! Charlotte 's crying . She 's got an ear infection again .
JODI: I did n't know what to do .
PETE: We 're home .
DEBBIE: Are you okay ? What 's the matter ?
CHARLOTTE: I just want to rip my ear off , it hurts so much .
DEBBIE: I told you the pediatrician did n't know what he was talking about .
PETE: Oh , come on . You ca n't blame it on our doctor . Ear infections are common in little kids .
DEBBIE: Not in kids over six years old . We 're going to the Eastern doctor .
PETE: If she 's in this much pain , we should call a real doctor .
DEBBIE: Are you kidding right now ?
PETE: Okay .
DOCTOR SEDUKU: What we should do is easy and simple . No more dairy , no more wheat , no more sugar .
DEBBIE: Sugar , wheat and dairy . Okay .
PETE: What the fuck is left ? Sorry . Is n't everything sugar , wheat and dairy ?
DOCTOR SEDUKU: She can have vegetables and f-r-ruits . Dr. Seduku has both an accent and a lisp .
PETE: Oh , she can eat fr-r-ruits .
DOCTOR SEDUKU: Fr-r-ruits , yes .
PETE: Any kind of fr-r-ruits ?
DOCTOR SEDUKU: Mangos , pineapple
PETE: It is n't like there are safe fr-r- uits and then unsafe fr-r-ruits .
DOCTOR SEDUKU: No , no .
PETE: What about F-r-r-rench f-r-r-ries ? Can we do something like that ?
DOCTOR SEDUKU: Are you okay ? Would you like to come on the table ?
PETE: I 'm okay .
DEBBIE: Why do n't you go on the table ?
PETE: No .
DEBBIE: Why do n't you go on the table ? It looks like you need to get on the table .
PETE: I do n't want to get on the table .
DEBBIE: Pete !
PETE: I need you to look at something . In my butt .
DEBBIE: Why ?
PETE: I think I 've got something in there , and I 'm not limber enough to see . I need you to look at it . I might have like an anal fissure o a hemorrhoid or a worm o something .
DEBBIE: What are you doing with your phone ?
PETE: Trying to take pictures of it , so I can compare it to something on Google .
DEBBIE: Can we just keep like a small shred of mystery in our relationship ?
PETE: Look , I saw you have two babies , okay ? Seriously , I need you to get all up in that .
DEBBIE: I do not want to investigate you anus .
PETE: It 's payback time .
DEBBIE: It 's a hemorrhoid .
PETE: Thank you . Now erase that from you memory .
DEBBIE: Where did she get those clothes ? Those are expensive .
JODI: Where do you think ? I do n't want this to sound harsh , but everything that comes out of her mouth is a lie . Everything that comes into it is a dick .
DEBBIE: Everything that goes in is dicks ?
JODI: A dick .
DEBBIE: Do n't say that .
JODI: I 'm sorry , I 'm just being protective of the store .
DEBBIE: I 'm going to go talk to her . Debbie walks over to Desi .
DESI: Uh , yeah .
DEBBIE: It 's so nice . Do you love it ?
DESI: Well , I mean , it 's not a fucking Porsche , but it 'll do for now .
DEBBIE: Hey Desi , would you mind wearing some of the clothes we have in the store ?
DESI: Yeah , sure . I 'm sorry . Desi picks a shirt .
DEBBIE: Did you ?
DESI: Yeah . I did the tiger on a piece of paper separately , and then I transferred it to the t-shirt .
DEBBIE: Wow . So you stenciled on the tiger ?
DESI: I drew it on a piece of paper , and then I transferred the drawing to the t-shirt .
DEBBIE: You have an amazing body .
DESI: Really ?
DEBBIE: Yes . Are those real ?
DESI: My boobs ? Yeah Do you want to touch them ?
DEBBIE: Really ?
DESI: Touch ` em !
DEBBIE: Okay . Debbie squeezes Desi 's breasts .
DESI: No . There 's some meat in there .
DEBBIE: Since I had kids , my boobs are just gone . They did n't even say goodbye . They just left .
DESI: By the time I 'm forty , these are going to go National Geographic on me .
DEBBIE: I feel bad about myself right now .
PETE: We expected more . I mean , I know it 's a bad market but that 's still way under what we were looking for .
LARRY: Did you miss me Travis ?
TRIPLET #1: It 's Jack !
LARRY: Hey , Jack .
TRIPLET #1: My daddy does n't know my name .
CHARLOTTE: Can I go show them my crystals efore they leave ?
DEBBIE: Yeah , really quick . Charlotte leaves with the triplets .
LARRY: Go play with your tiny uncles . So , what are you doing , spring cleaning ?
DEBBIE: I 'm getting rid of everything in the house that has gluten or sugar .
LARRY: Why ? What 's wrong with gluten ?
DEBBIE: Gluten 's really bad for you .
LARRY: I do n't think so . It 's wheat .
DEBBIE: Do n't you watch Dr. Oz ?
LARRY: As in the Wizard of ?
SADIE: Hey , Mom . We were wondering if we could use the computer to iChat .
DEBBIE: Remember the rules ? Eight to eight- thirty ?
SADIE: Yeah , but I have a friend over .
DEBBIE: Hi Wendy . Why do n't you guys go play ? You could go build a fort !
LARRY: Remember the Alamo ?
DEBBIE: Have you ever built a fort , Wendy ?
WENDY: Like on Facebook ?
LARRY: I will take this if you 're going to throw it away , because at ou house , we 're wheat eaters .
DEBBIE: But do n't you want to live long enough to see your kids grow up ?
LARRY: That 's up to god , honey .
DEBBIE: But that 's really not good for the kids .
LARRY: The kids eat grass . This is fine .
SADIE: Wendy 's mom lets her go on wheneve she wants .
WENDY: My mom 's pretty cool about it as long as I finish my homework .
DEBBIE: Yeah . Well , I guess I 'm not the cool one . But the rules are just different in our house .
SADIE: But I get better grades than Wendy .
WENDY: She does . She 's so smart .
LARRY: Let me just grab the candy worms .
SADIE: Your rules are ridiculous .
DEBBIE: Do n't sass me .
SADIE: I 'm only sassing you because you 're throwing out all the food in ou house and I 'm freaking starving . You 're being stupid .
DEBBIE: Wendy , can you go stand in the other room , please ?
WENDY: Yeah . Wendy exits .
SADIE: Mom .
DEBBIE: Give me your iPhone now .
LARRY: The nougat things are good .
SADIE: I have all my contacts in there .
DEBBIE: Okay , if you do n't give me you phone right now , then I 'm going to have to take away your phone and your computer .
SADIE: Jesus Christ
DEBBIE: That 's it .
SADIE: I need my computer to do homework .
DEBBIE: No phone , no computer .
SADIE: This is B.S . This is a bunch of F- ing S. You 're acting like a B .
LARRY: Kids ! Time to go !
DEBBIE: You go to your room right now . Sadie runs off .
LARRY: She 's a little pip . Just like he mommy . So I might have a jo tomorrow , at least I 'm going to go try to give an estimate . Do you mind taking the kids for a couple hours ?
DEBBIE: Okay .
LARRY: This is nice . You and I do n't spend enough time together , do we ?
DEBBIE: We spend enough time together .
LARRY: We do ?
DEBBIE: It 's quality time .
LARRY: Then we do . I 'll go with what you think .
DEBBIE: What else did they say ?
PETE: Some kid named Joseph
DEBBIE: I know Joseph .
PETE: You do ? He 's making a `` Hot or Not '' list .
DEBBIE: What ?
PETE: So , Sadie said , `` That 's so lame and immature that you 're doing that . '' And then Joseph says , `` Yo , girl . We 're just having some fun so do n't e a bitch , yo . ''
DEBBIE: That is not nice .
PETE: So , then Sadie said , `` Do n't call me a bitch . '' And Joseph said , `` I did n't call you a bitch , I said do n't act like a bitch . And by the way you 're in the ` Not Hot ' column . ''
DEBBIE: Who made him the judge of hot ?
PETE: Do you realize what that could do to her self-esteem ?
DEBBIE: What a little fuckhead . I 'll kill him .
PETE: So then Sadie said , `` You 're in the jackass column . I 've got to go . I 'm ored of you . ''
DEBBIE: That is cool . That 's taking the high road .
PETE: For some reason , there 's an emoticon of a panda doing push-ups .
DEBBIE: I wonder what that means .
PETE: I do n't think it means anything , I think it 's just adorable .
DEBBIE: Aww . She 's a good girl . She was polite , and she stood up fo herself .
PETE: That 's pretty cool . They hear a door slam . Debbie gasps .
DEBBIE: Shit . I thought she was coming in .
PETE: Oh my god , that scared me to death .
DEBBIE: If she caught us , she would kill us .
PETE: I 've got to make a call .
DEBBIE: What financial problems ?
ACCOUNTANT: Well , for one thing , you were ight , you are missing about ten thousand dollars from the store . And then , Pete 's record not selling well .
DEBBIE: I thought we were n't supposed to hear for three weeks ?
ACCOUNTANT: We heard .
DEBBIE: You heard .
ACCOUNTANT: And they 're bad . You know , it 's that , and it 's the money that he 's een lending to his father , that 's creating a strain .
DEBBIE: How much have we lent him ?
ACCOUNTANT: Eighty thousand .
DEBBIE: Did you say `` eight thousand '' o `` eighty thousand '' ?
ACCOUNTANT: Eighty thousand , over the past couple of years . And then you missed the mortgage payment
DEBBIE: On the house ?
ACCOUNTANT: And you missed the rental on the office .
DEBBIE: Does Pete know that ?
ACCOUNTANT: Oh , yeah . We 're on the phone all the time . Look , I know you 're going through a hard time , and I want you guys to know that we 're here fo you , okay ? Anything you guys need , that 's why we 're here . We 're here for times like this .
DEBBIE: What are you going to do ?
ACCOUNTANT: There 's not much I can do .
PETE: What are you doing ?
RONNIE: I 'm drawing the album cover for Van Halen 's Diver Down .
PETE: If you spent a little bit more time focusing on Graham Parker instead of drawing album covers , I would n't e in this predicament .
RONNIE: I 'm focused on Graham Parker .
PETE: You 're supposed to help me with him !
RONNIE: I 've done everything I can , Pete . You had me pushing around a corpse . It was like being in fucking Weekend at Graham 's .
PETE: What should we do ? I 'm out of ideas .
RONNIE: You fly in The Rumour . I ca n't sell a reunion concert without the band . It 's ridiculous .
PETE: With what ? I ca n't afford it .
RONNIE: You put this on yourself . You wanted the responsibility , take it on the chin , and stop acting like a itch .
PETE: What did you call me ?
RONNIE: Chin .
PETE: Do n't talk to me about esponsibilities . I have a life . I have a family . I ca n't afford to sit in my apartment getting high , jerking off , and then going to Tommy 's Chili Burgers at three in the morning .
RONNIE: That 's not even the order that happens in !
PETE: I have everything to lose here . Everything .
RONNIE: Yes . Because you spent thousands of dollars on shit we do n't need . You eally need to spend thirty thousand dollars on a fucking neon sign , dude ? Which is inside ? It 's not even outside . We know where we work .
PETE: If you want to sign a band , you have to look like you 're the real deal .
RONNIE: Princess Labia , how much is it to fly The Rumour in ?
CAT: It 's twelve thousand .
RONNIE: Twelve thousand dollars !
PETE: You know what ? Fine . Fly in The Rumour . Put it on my AmEx .
DEBBIE: No , you said it was impossible .
DR. PELLIGRINO: I do n't think I said it was impossible .
DEBBIE: Yeah .
DR. PELLIGRINO: I usually do n't say impossible . I like to leave some wiggle room .
DEBBIE: You said that my fibroid was like a giant boulder , like the one from the Indiana Jones movies blocking up my uterus .
DR. PELLIGRINO: And I need to stop using that eference of Indiana Jones . I think that 's not appropriate when talking about the reproductive system .
DEBBIE: It 's okay .
DR. PELLIGRINO: Anyway , somehow the Eastern medicine has worked and the fibroid has dissipated .
DEBBIE: That 's great .
DR. PELLIGRINO: Yes . Your fibroid shrunk , and somehow it allowed you to get pregnant .
DEBBIE: What ?
DR. PELLIGRINO: You 're going to have your third aby . Congratulations .
DEBBIE: No .
DR. PELLIGRINO: Yes . Debbie does not react .
DEBBIE: That 's good news . Another baby , at forty .
DR. PELLIGRINO: Debbie ?
DEBBIE: I am thrilled . And Pete is going to e so happy .
DR. PELLIGRINO: So , you 're okay ?
DEBBIE: What a relief . I can finally relax now , you know ? I 'm so happy , I eally am . It 's good .
DR. PELLIGRINO: Great . Great .
PETE: Hey , why are you in a bathrobe ? It 's the middle of the afternoon .
LARRY: I took a late shower . Why are you usting my balls ? Look , I 'm sorry about the record . You 're going through financial shit . This is what I live with . This is a horrible time in human history . What is that ?
PETE: Something that might help both of our situations . Pete hands him the drawing .
LARRY: I do n't want this . I do n't even like it . I 'm not going to hang it up .
PETE: It 's not for you to hang up . It 's for you to sell . That way I can give it to you and you can make some money , and Debbie does n't know that I 'm giving you anything .
LARRY: Well , you 're not giving me money . You 're giving me a project . I do n't know how to sell this . I 'm not an art dealer .
PETE: Just sell it online . Do some esearch , make some calls . Or is that too hard to do with your high lood pressure ?
LARRY: All right . Do n't get snippy . Just ecause you write a great song does n't mean you can draw .
PETE: It 's incredible . John Lennon drew it .
LARRY: I think it 's a Ringo . Do n't beat me up if I get three hundred dollars for it .
PETE: Do n't take less than sixty-five hundred for that . It 's very valuable . It 's important to me . I want you to sell it so I can help you .
LARRY: Okay .
PETE: I 'll see you at my party .
LARRY: What should I bring ? You want wine or something ?
PETE: No . Do n't buy wine with my money and give it to me at my party .
LARRY: That 's mean .
PETE: I love you . Bye .
LARRY: All right . Bye How do I call eBay ?
DEBBIE: She 's so cute . She 's so tall .
PETE: I know . How did that happen ?
DEBBIE: Do you ever wish we had a bigge family ?
PETE: No , never for a second . Never .
DEBBIE: Never ?
PETE: Never . I love what we have . One ? A eeze . Two ? Brutal . Three ? Put a ullet in my head . Debbie is totally deflated .
DEBBIE: Hey !
JOSEPH: Yo , sup ?
DEBBIE: I 'm Sadie 's mom .
JOSEPH: Sadie ?
DEBBIE: Sadie , the one you chat with on the internet ?
JOSEPH: Nah , man . That ai n't me .
DEBBIE: Well , it was you , I saw you picture . Did you make a `` Hot '' list and not put Sadie on the `` Hot '' list ?
JOSEPH: She was not on my list , no .
DEBBIE: You know what I 'm going to do ? I 'm going to make my own `` Hot '' list , and you know what ? You 're on the `` Not Hot '' list . How does that feel ?
JOSEPH: It does n't bother me . I 'm comfortable with the way I am .
DEBBIE: Maybe you should n't be so comfortable with yourself . You know why ? You look like a miniature Tom Petty . How 's that feel ? Huh ? You think that haircut 's cool ? It 's not . It looks like you put you Justin Bieber wig on backwards . You still comfortable with yourself ? Why are you wearing a tank top ? Huh ? So you can show off your bald pits , you little hairless wonder ? Cool tank top , man . So next time you think about writing something nasty on my daughter 's Facebook page , just remember me . Remembe me . I will come down here , and I will fuck you up . Joseph looks upset .
JOSEPH: Okay , I 'm sorry .
DEBBIE: Wait a minute . Hey . Are you crying ?
JOSEPH: Just let me go .
DEBBIE: I 'm sorry . I 'm not in my right head .
JOSEPH: I understand . My mom is going through menopause , too . It 's a hard time .
DEBBIE: What did you say ?
JOSEPH: You 're going through menopause ?
DEBBIE: I 'm not going through menopause ! I 'm not going to go through menopause for twenty years . I 'm pregnant you little bitch . God damn it ! She storms off .

PETE: What 's press turnout like ?
RONNIE: Are you serious ? Nobody came .
PETE: Nobody is here ?
RONNIE: Oh , the guy from Green Day is here .
PETE: Yeah , Billie Joe , I emailed him . He 's a fan .
RONNIE: You 've got to get a photo of the two of them .
PETE: No , he says he does n't want to do any press , he 's just watching the show .
RONNIE: Oh , how punk rock of him . `` I do n't like photographs . '' Grow up , Green Day !
BILLIE JOE: Shut up , Tom Selleck .
JAY: I would n't call them classically good dance moves , but you left it all out there . You 're a blast to dance with .
DEBBIE: Thank you .
JAY: We 're having a little shindig at the hotel after this , you should come by and hang out .
DEBBIE: You want me to come to the hotel ?
JAY: Yes . I want you to come by the hotel with me .
DEBBIE: Well , what would we do there ?
JAY: Maybe we can find somewhere quiet , have fun , and see where it goes . Like adults do sometimes .
DEBBIE: Like , sex ?
JAY: I mean , if you want . If that 's on the docket . I 'm not trying to force that .
DEBBIE: So you would do sex with me ?

GRAHAM: Pete ! How are you , man ?
PETE: Well , the first numbers came in .
GRAHAM: Happy ? How 's it looking ?
PETE: About half of your last record .
GRAHAM: Ah , so you were expecting it to sell . They never sell anymore . They used to sell . But now they do n't . I 'm not a sexy sixteen-year-old girl .
PETE: But I wanted to sell it . It 's such a good record . I feel like I let you down .
GRAHAM: No , I 'm going to be fine . My overheads are so low . I just got a song in Glee .
PETE: Graham , I do n't have small nuts , all right ? I have big nuts . And I need to provide for them . Billie Joe comes over to congratulate Graham .

PETE: No . I 'm fine . You guys go . Congratulations on Glee . They walk away .
BILLIE JOE: You got a song on Glee ? That 's killer , man . That 's so much money , that 's good for all of us .
DEBBIE: Why did you put that guy 's teeth in your mouth ? That 's so gross . He was dirty .
DESI: No , he was wearing a tie .
DEBBIE: That 's true .
DESI: When I kissed him , I felt his little tiny teeth nubs with my tongue .
DEBBIE: You did ?
DESI: It was like kissing a baby . French kissing a baby .
DEBBIE: Can I ask you something stupid ? Do you know why we 're missing money at the store ?
DESI: Are you guys missing money ?
DEBBIE: Like twelve thousand dollars .
DESI: Wait . Do you think I took it ?
DEBBIE: Well , no . I did , but now I do n't .
DESI: It 's not me .

DESI: Yes , you 're right . Look . I am an escort . I get paid to go out on dates . Debbie looks shocked .
DEBBIE: Well , that 's good .
DESI: But I always do . That 's why I only do it four to eight times a year , fifteen times max .
DEBBIE: Huh .
DESI: One year I did it twenty .
DEBBIE: As long as you think it 's safe .
DESI: It 's safe . I only do it ten to thirty times a year .
DEBBIE: So , who do you think is stealing money ?
DESI: It 's Jodi .
DEBBIE: No .
DESI: Yeah . She 's a pilled-out whore .
DEBBIE: Since you told me , I want to tell you something .
DESI: You 're pregnant .
DEBBIE: How did you know ? Desi nods .
DESI: You did n't tell Pete yet ? Why not ?
DEBBIE: I do n't know . I just want him to want me . I do n't want him to want me because I 'm pregnant .
DESI: Go home and suck his dick and tell him then and he will love it .
DEBBIE: You think ?
DESI: He 'll be so excited . Or even bette yet , you should tell him while you 're sucking his dick . `` I 'm pregnant . ''
DEBBIE: What are you doing ?
PETE: I 'm returning some emails .
DEBBIE: What time do you have to go to work ?
PETE: Like ten minutes ago .
DEBBIE: Want to be late ?
PETE: No , I ca n't be late . Not today . Pause .
DEBBIE: Do you see me ? Standing here in front of you ? Half-naked ?
PETE: Yeah .
DEBBIE: And does that make you feel anything ?
PETE: Come on . Are you trying to start a fight ?
DEBBIE: No , I 'm not trying to start a fight with you . I 'm trying to fuck you !
PETE: Oh god , you know what ? Today of all days you need to give me a break , all right ?
DEBBIE: Whatever . She exits into the bathroom . There 's silence .
PETE: I did n't realize it was intentional ! I did n't say anything ecause I did n't want you to be embarrassed . I thought I was being gallant . No response .
DEBBIE: You know what your problem is ? You 're never in the moment , you 're never present . You 're never in you ody .
PETE: That 's not true . I am in the moment . You know how I know ? I want to get the fuck out of the moment . I swear , I ca n't win with you . Pete walks out of the room . Debbie follows .
DEBBIE: You ca n't just walk away .
PETE: What ? Not great . I 'm still waiting for numbers to come in .
DEBBIE: What have you heard ?
PETE: A couple numbers have trickled in . It 's lower than we expected .
DEBBIE: Then why are you giving Larry money ?
PETE: What ?
DEBBIE: I know everything . I talked to the accountant .
PETE: All right , you know what ? I do n't want to get into some nasty fight . So can we please talk to each othe like the therapist told us to talk to each other ?
DEBBIE: Fine . It makes me feel sad when you are dishonest .
PETE: I understand it makes you feel bad when I am dishonest with you .
DEBBIE: Okay . It makes me sad when it 's so easy to trick you into lying ecause you 're such a lying shitbag .
PETE: You ca n't do that . The therapist said you 're not allowed to judge me .
DEBBIE: That 's not a judgment . That 's just a fact .
PETE: Fair enough . Sometimes I withhold truth , that is true . But it 's only ecause I 'm scared to death of you crazy-assed illogical overreactions .
DEBBIE: Well , it hurts me inside and triggers me that you 're such a dishonest shit that you 're lending your father money without telling me , while your record company is going bankrupt and we 're on the verge of losing our fucking house !
PETE: I 've taken Viagra for two years . I ate six muffins downstairs a while ago and my cholesterol level is 305 . My heart could explode at any second . These might be my very last words .
MORE: 95 .
DEBBIE: What are we even doing ? This is not making me happy . You 're not happy . You do n't like me . I can feel that . I 'm not blind . Jesus . We 're like usiness associates . We 're like other and sister . There 's no passion there .
PETE: We 're not like brother and sister . You know what we 're like ? We 're like Simon and Garfunkel , and somehow you turned me into Garfunkel .
DEBBIE: I do n't even know what that means .
PETE: Art Garfunkel .
DEBBIE: What 's wrong with Art Garfunkel ? He has a beautiful voice .
PETE: He 's got an amazing voice . He could put a harmony to anything , but what I 'm saying is that you turned me into him .

MS. LAVIANI: Joseph was very upset when I spoke to him about this , so I thought it was important that we join togethe and work this through .
PETE: Absolutely .
CATHERINE: We 're going to work through it , but Debbie told my son that he looked like Tom Petty , in a negative way
PETE: Who 's Tom Petty ?
CATHERINE: You know who Tom Petty is . And she said that if she had to come back , that she was going to `` F up his pussy ass . '' Which is what she said .
DEBBIE: Are you serious ? I did n't . I would never . To a child ? Your son has een defiling my daughter 's Facebook page now for months .
CATHERINE: These people are liars . He said that my son was an animal and that if I did n't keep him on a leash that he would hit him with his car .

PETE: That 's ridiculous . Who talks like that ?
CATHERINE: You do . Debbie tries to hide a smile .
DEBBIE: He did n't say that .
CATHERINE: He said it . To me .
PETE: What I said was that we need to keep an extra eye on our kids ecause with all the technological advances , they need to learn to use them responsibly .
CATHERINE: No . He called me an `` iCunt . ''
PETE: A what ?
MS. LAVIANI: Language , Catherine !
CATHERINE: How am I going to relay what these two nutballs said to me unless I say it .
MS. LAVIANI: Can you please not talk like that , Catherine ? Music Man is rehearsing next door .
CATHERINE: Sorry , fucking Music Man . Maybe if I looked more like this fake ullshit couple , looks like they 're in a bank commercial . That 's what you look like . Like a bullshit bank commercial couple .
MS. LAVIANI: None of this talk is productive .
CATHERINE: I 'd like to rear up and jackknife my legs and kick you both in the jaw with my foot bone .
DEBBIE: You 're just really scaring me .
CATHERINE: This is what happens when you corner a rat . You corner me , I will chew through you .
MS. LAVIANI: Catherine , you 're better than this .
CATHERINE: Fuck you , Jill . You 're a horrible woman . This is why everybody hates you . This kind of shit . Ineffective . Bullshit hair . And I 'm glad your husband died . Because you 're a fucking asshole . He probably killed himself .
MS. LAVIANI: Okay , Catherine . I think we know what 's happening now .
DEBBIE: Now you know what we 're dealing with .
CHARLOTTE: I 'm not going to eat that chicken .
DEBBIE: Why not ?
CHARLOTTE: Because I feel like I 'm going to be a vegetarian .
DEBBIE: Can you become a vegetarian tomorrow ?
CHARLOTTE: No . Sadie storms in .
SADIE: You guys have been reading my texts ?
PETE: No , we have n't .
DEBBIE: Yes , we have . We 're supposed to keep an eye on you .
PETE: How did you find out ?
SADIE: Joseph told me that you flipped out on him and his mom and that you guys are nuts , and I agree .
PETE: Do n't be disrespectful .
SADIE: You 're the ones who are disrespectful . Reading my texts is like reading my diary .
DEBBIE: You were really sweet on you iChat . We were really proud of you .
PETE: Yeah , we were going to give you your computer and phone back .
SADIE: Fuck you !
PETE: Okay , there 's the first official `` Fuck you . ''
DEBBIE: That is not how we talk to each other in this house .
SADIE: You guys talk to each other like that all the time ! And to Joseph and his mom . You made Joseph cry .
CHARLOTTE: Joseph has a crush on you . You like a boy who cries .
SADIE: Shut up , Charlotte . You guys so desperately want me to be perfect and to make no mistakes . Well , you two are fucking insane .
DEBBIE: Okay .
SADIE: All you do is fight . Or you do n't fight , which is even worse because it looks like you hate each othe for weeks . You obsess over every little thing I do , and you do n't trust in me or believe in me . Well , I 'm fucking sick of it ! Yeah , I said `` fuck . '' Fuck fuck fuck . Ground me forever I do n't care .

SADIE: Where did you find these ?
CHARLOTTE: I stole them .
SADIE: Thank you .
CHARLOTTE: No big deal .
PETE: Our kids are crazy . And it 's ou fault .
DEBBIE: Do you think there 's anything we can do to turn it around ?
PETE: Sadie 's thirteen . She might be a lost cause .
DEBBIE: Where did she learn that kind of language ? We do n't talk like that .
PETE: I have no fucking idea Do you think Sadie is this crazy because of us ? Or is it hormones and Lost .
DEBBIE: J.J. Abrams . He 's ruining ou daughter . That fucking geek .
PETE: I feel bad for us .
DEBBIE: All of a sudden we 're like a magnet for negativity . Why do people keep attacking us ? What did we do ? We 're just doing our best .
PETE: Should we talk about our fight ?
DEBBIE: I think we 're under enough pressure . Let 's just let it go this time .
PETE: Yeah .
DEBBIE: We can give each other a break .
PETE: Great . Thank you . And I 'm sorry about my dad . You 're right . I 'm sorry that he 's just an endless mooch . The truth is , this is n't about us . It 's about our parents .
DEBBIE: We 're not even mad at each other . We 're mad at them .
PETE: Exactly .
DEBBIE: Let 's just take away our parents ' power by loving them .
PETE: Can we do that ?
DEBBIE: Yes .
PETE: Thank god .
DEBBIE: I kind of feel better already , do you ?
PETE: I do .
DEBBIE: I love you .
PETE: I love you too .
DEBBIE: It 's not us , it 's them .
PETE: Totally . They hug .

SADIE: Jin , Sun
PETE: Okay ? I need you to just get in the shower . Get dressed . Let 's just put it on hold .

PETE: Do n't think about Lost today . Tomorrow Lost . All day . I ca n't wait to hear about it . Jack ? No way . Really ? Right now , shower .
SADIE: I do n't make fun of your stupid Mad Men .
PETE: First of all , I do n't get worked up over Mad Men .
SADIE: That 's because Mad Men sucks .
PETE: What Don Draper has gone through eats whatever Jack is running from on some island .
SADIE: A bunch of people smoking in an office , it 's stupid .

BARB: You 're comfortable with that around your husband ?
DEBBIE: Pete would n't know what to do with that . Angle on Barry and Pete .
BARRY: You think our wives are looking at us right now ?

BARRY: What do you do in Chino , Oliver ?
OLIVER: I am a surgeon .
BARB: Wow , what kind ?
OLIVER: Mainly of the spine . My specialty is scoliosis surgery .

OLIVER: Not really .
CLAIRE: I 'm Claire , Larry 's wife . Very good to see you , but excuse me , I 'm going to go get the kids . Claire runs off .
LARRY: We wo n't see her now for the whole day . I 'd help honey , but I 've got the blood pressure , and I do n't want to .
PETE: Dad , you want a drink ?
LARRY: Yeah , a little white wine .
PETE: White wine ? Okay , heavy stuff .
LARRY: So , who knew that Debbie had a dad ! Where have you been for fifteen years ? Never seen you at Hanukkah , Christmas , Ramadan , nothing . How do you get out of all that stuff ? Do you have a wife ?
OLIVER: My wife is at home .
DEBBIE: Why did n't she come ?
OLIVER: Construction . They 're sanding ou deck .
LARRY: You let the woman sand the deck ?
OLIVER: She supervises it , yes . Sadie , Charlotte and Desi walk over .

LARRY: Look how big the kids are . Sadie ! He gives Desi a hug .
DESI: Hi , Larry .
LARRY: Hi , Sadie .
SADIE: Mom . Who is Oliver ?
DEBBIE: What do you mean ?
CHARLOTTE: Is he your dad ?
DEBBIE: He is my biological father .
CHARLOTTE: What does that mean ?
DEBBIE: He and my mom had a baby and that was me .
SADIE: Oh , so you 're our grandpa .
OLIVER: Why do n't you ask your mother ?
DEBBIE: Yes , well , that would make him you grandpa . Do you want him to be ?
CHARLOTTE: Yes . Then we get another grandpa . Come on !
LARRY: That was deeply uncomfortable . Thank god the pretty girl was here to divert our attention .
JASON: Oh , hi . I did not see you there .
RONNIE: I saw you there .
DESI: Did you guys come together ? Are you a couple ?
JASON: That 's fair .
DESI: I just assumed .
RONNIE: This is a straight man mustache .
DESI: What is the different between a gay man 's mustache and a straight man 's mustache ? Pause .
JASON: The smell .
DESI: Excuse me . Desi swims away .
LARRY: So , spinal surgery just seems to me to be at the top of the surgery chain .
OLIVER: Well , we 're not cardio , we 're not neuro , but I like to think we 're an important part of the spectrum .
LARRY: Do you operate every single day ?
OLIVER: Most days .
LARRY: Multiple times a day ?
OLIVER: Three , four times .
LARRY: So what 's the price range ? Like if I wanted
OLIVER: Oh , I 'd rather not say .
LARRY: It 's so big you 're embarrassed to say .
OLIVER: I would n't say embarrassed .
LARRY: Are there hunchbacks today ?
OLIVER: Of course .
LARRY: I 've never seen one .
OLIVER: Well , that 's because there are spinal surgeons .
LARRY: That 's because of you . Each time I do n't see a hunchback , you 're getting that much richer .
OLIVER: Who does n't like The Beatles ?
LARRY: Nobody .
DESI: So what 's your sun sign ?
RONNIE: Libra .
JASON: Oh , boy .
DESI: That 's not good .
JASON: No , sir .
DESI: Not for me , that 's not good . Sexually we are completely incompatible .
RONNIE: That 's not true .
JASON: That 's such a shame . That 's as bad as it gets .
DESI: What 's yours ?
JASON: I 'm a Cancer .
DESI: Really ?
JASON: Is that good ?
RONNIE: What does it mean ?
DESI: That 's really strange . Well , Taurus and Cancers are sort of soul mates of the Zodiac . We 're like perfectly compatible . I balance what you lack , and you make up for what I lack . And a quiet Cancer almost always has a huge penis .
JASON: You 're making me embarrassed .
DEBBIE: I wanted to make a toast . Thank you guys so much for coming Pete 's turning forty .
PETE: Weird .
DEBBIE: And we 're ready to start this new phase of our lives with open hearts . Ready to just choose joy and forgive everybody , so thank you all for coming .
LARRY: Wait . Forgive who ?
PETE: I think she just meant generally . You know ? Put the past behind us .
DEBBIE: And live without resentments .
LARRY: But specifically who are you forgiving ? I like to know the details before I toast .
DEBBIE: Well , you and my dad and others .
LARRY: I see . I know you have some issues with me , but I 'm curious , what 's he in for ? Before today nobody even knew he existed .
DEBBIE: My parents divorced when I was eally young and we do n't spend that much time together and I 'd like to work on that . Just like we 'd like to work on how you have financial issues .
BARRY: She means all the lending . And the orrowing
LARRY: I know what she meant .
JASON: You are a beautiful woman , but you are not totally maxed out . I would say honestly , you 're a six . Six and a half . I could make you an eleven .
DESI: Really ?
JASON: When I found Deb , she was a seven . And now she 's a twelve .
DESI: I want to be a twelve .
JASON: You ca n't be lazy .
DESI: I do n't want to be lazy .
JASON: Look at me . You can not be lazy .
DESI: I wo n't be lazy .
JASON: Do you know how she got her body ? Bodies By Jason .
DESI: Wow .
JASON: Say it .
DESI: Bodies By Jason .
JASON: Say it again .
DESI: Bodies By Jason .
JASON: And now just say Jason .
DESI: Jason .
JASON: Again ?
DESI: Jason .
JASON: That sounds right , does n't it ?
DESI: Yeah .
RONNIE: What the fuck is happening right now ?
LARRY: When was the last time you two saw each other , if you do n't mind me asking ?
OLIVER: Actually , we had lunch togethe last week .
LARRY: And before that ?
OLIVER: It 's been about seven years .
LARRY: Seven years ? That 's a joke , right ? That 's like two Olympics . And I 'm the bad guy . What Debbie does n't understand is that it 's not bad to help out a parent . And it 's certainly not bad for a parent to help out a child . I 'm sure Olive would agree .
DEBBIE: Are you really doing this right now ?
LARRY: Am I doing what ? I did n't start the toast .
DEBBIE: Are you really about to hit up my dad for money ?
LARRY: What ? He does four operations a day . It 's perfect . It helps everybody , and it relieves his guilt from all the abandonment issues .
DEBBIE: You ca n't buy forgiveness , right Pete ?
PETE: I do n't think anyone 's looking fo handouts We 'd pay him back .
OLIVER: If you two are in a bind I 'd be more than happy to help .
DEBBIE: No . It 's not good to borrow money from family members because it causes resentment , remember ?
PETE: Yeah .
LARRY: What do you want me to do ? Admit that my life is shit ? Is that what you want me to say ? You happy ? Are n't I allowed a little joy with these children I never wanted to have ?
DEBBIE: You have never once stopped asking us for money .
LARRY: Family helps family .
PETE: It 's true . Family helps family . Look , I do n't expect you to fully understand . Your dad left . You 're oken inside . It 's not your fault you ca n't feel love . There 's something that you ca n't this is coming out wrong .
DEBBIE: You know what ? I would rather have my dad than your dad , because he does n't drive me crazy . You know the best quality my father has ? He asks for nothing . I do n't know what the fuck he 's thinking right now . Look at that . Nothing . I do n't even know him . And I turned out perfectly fine without his input .
LARRY: I just figured out what you problem is . You hate Jews . Which is so odd because your children are Jewish .
DEBBIE: Do n't play the Jew card , Larry .
LARRY: I 'm not playing any Jew card .
DEBBIE: Seriously , it 's used up .
LARRY: You ca n't use up a Jew card . That 's the whole point of a Jew card .
BARRY: That 's right . You ca n't use it up , it goes forever .
OLIVER: You know what ? I have to go . Oliver gets up to leave .
PETE: Great . What a big surprise . Bye Oliver . See you later . See you in another seven years . Make sure to say goodbye to the grandkids , who you met today . You know , nothing I do is right because of you ? Nothing . No matter how hard I try , I 'm just the asshole here , but you know what I realized ? It 's you . You 're the asshole .
OLIVER: Good luck working that out . Happy irthday and go fuck yourself . Oliver walks out .
LARRY: See you when the Cubs win the Pennant .
BARB: I 'm going to light the candles . Get it going .
LARRY: Maybe we should try the toast again .
DEBBIE: Can you be quiet ? You just threw me under the bus .
PETE: No . We agreed to let go and forgive , but then you started ipping into my dad like a crazy person .
DEBBIE: I 'm not ripping into your dad . I 'm just saying to him what you say to me .
PETE: Do n't be such a ball buster .
DEBBIE: I am not a ball buster . You make me one ! I am a fun girl ! I am fun- loving ! I am a good time Sally ! I dance hip-hop . I can not believe I 've wasted my whole life busting the balls of people who have no alls . I am the only one here who has any balls .
SADIE: Mom ? Debbie turns , caught .
DEBBIE: What ?
SADIE: You 're smoking ? In the front yard ?
DEBBIE: No , they 're Barb 's .
SADIE: Mom ! Since when have you been a smoker ?

BARB: Deb , you ca n't smoke , you 're pregnant . You 've been doing so well .
CHARLOTTE: You 're pregnant ?

CHARLOTTE: I do n't want her as a sister .
BARB: I 'm sorry . I 'm so sorry . It just slipped out .
PETE: Are you really pregnant ? Since when are you pregnant ?
DEBBIE: Since when do you care ? You do n't want another baby .
PETE: You have no idea what I want .

SADIE: Shut up , Charlotte !
CHARLOTTE: Shut up !
DEBBIE: Okay , Sadie . Shut up .

LARRY: Hey ! We just heard . You 're having a aby ! See , it can happen to anybody .
CLAIRE: That is so wonderful . We 're so happy for you .
SADIE: This is too adult for you . Let 's go outside .
DEBBIE: Well , I guess we 're stuck togethe forever , then , right ?
PETE: Were n't we always ?
DEBBIE: You do n't even want a baby .
PETE: Of course I do . I never said that . Look , I did n't want one if I could choose .
DEBBIE: I should put that on a Hallmark card . That 's beautiful .
OLIVER: Good luck with the pregnancy , Debbie . But please , take care of yourself . It 's a much riskie pregnancy after forty .
DEBBIE: I 'm not forty .
OLIVER: Of course you are . You were born on December 5th , 1972 .
DEBBIE: How do you know ?
OLIVER: I was there . I 'm the one who took your mother to the hospital .
DEBBIE: That 's not what she said .
OLIVER: Your mom was in labor for only twenty minutes . It was like you could n't wait to meet me , can you imagine that ? Debbie is stunned .
DEBBIE: I do n't even know you . You ca n't just come into my house and eminisce .
OLIVER: Look , maybe we were just not meant to be in each other 's lives . I 'm not sure this was such a great idea .
DEBBIE: Hey , wait a minute . You did leave . And you did n't come back .
OLIVER: My first life was ruined . I did my est with my second .
DEBBIE: So I ruined your life ? I was eight .
OLIVER: People do better when I stay out of their lives . That 's what my son tells me . You think my life is so perfect ? I 've got a thirteen-year- old who 's a pot head , I 've got a wife who 's keeping Zoloft alive .
DEBBIE: You never said that before .
OLIVER: You do n't think I want to talk to you about this ? To share it with you ? It 's just not our way ! We do n't talk to each other , we do n't know each other . I thought that 's the way you wanted it . How do I get out of this ? How do I get you all to just help me down off the cross ? Debbie looks at him for a moment .
DEBBIE: You sound just like Sadie .
OLIVER: Who 's Sadie ? No . Your daughter , your younger ?
DEBBIE: The big one .
OLIVER: Your older . I know that ! She 's a wonderful girl .
LARRY: Hi , guys . Some of us need to leave . Would this be a good moment to sneak out ?
SADIE: Where 's Dad going ?
PETE: Best birthday ever !
TEENAGER: Bike lane , asshole ! Pete almost falls .
PETE: Fuck you , you Twilight pimply-ass motherfuckers !
BARB: Your dad 's still here .
DEBBIE: I know . It 's weird . Where the hell is Pete ? Sadie walks in with Joseph .
SADIE: Mom , is it okay if Joseph hangs out here for a while ?
DEBBIE: Sure . Hi , Joseph .
JOSEPH: Hi .
DEBBIE: Do you want a piece of cake ?
JOSEPH: Oh , yeah sure . Thank you .
BARB: They are so cute .
DEBBIE: So cute .
BARB: He looks exactly like Tom Petty .
PETE: Go around !
DESI: Hey , Pete . Great party ! They speed off .
PETE: Yeah . The best !
SADIE: Then you shake it . And then a estaurant comes up . Debbie walks outside .
DEBBIE: Dad ? Excuse me . I 'm going to go look for Pete . Would you mind staying with the girls for just a little bit ?
OLIVER: Well , if you want me to .
DEBBIE: If you do n't mind . You do n't have to .
OLIVER: Sure . Can I let Sadie show me the last episode of Lost ? She asked me if I 'd seen it , I have n't .
DEBBIE: That would be nice . Thank you .
OLIVER: Thank you . Debbie exits .
SADIE: I 'm going to let you watch Lost . Come on .
CHARLOTTE: Is it scary ?
SADIE: I 'll cover your eyes if it gets too scary .
LARRY: Are you mad at me ? Did I say something ?
DEBBIE: Shh . Larry , please .
PETE: You opened your door on me .
LARRY: Are you sure that 's him ? I do n't think that 's him .
PETE: I 'm going to write down you license plate number .
DEBBIE: What are you doing ?
PETE: Ow .
LARRY: I guess the party did n't turn out like you planned .
DEBBIE: It was n't a good party . A NURSE walks over to them .
NURSE: Hi . I 'll bring you in as soon as his x-rays are finished .
DEBBIE: Is he okay ?
NURSE: Yeah , he has a broken rib and he 's een crying a little bit , but he 'll e fine . The Nurse walks away .
LARRY: You know Pete was never a real fighter . But that 's why he married you . That 's why he loves you . Because you 're the fighter , and you need that . One person in a elationship has got to punch .
DEBBIE: Do you mean that in a good way ?
LARRY: Oh , it 's a high compliment .
DEBBIE: Thanks .
LARRY: Listen , I know what you 're worried about . You think he 's going to turn into me , but I do n't think it 's going to happen . He 's smarter and probably a little cuter . A little less Jewy . Although , after fifty , that 's all going to change . Be prepared to wake up one day with a a rabbi . But the good news is , he 'll love you forever . That 's in our DNA . We stick around .
DEBBIE: He worries about you . It puts a lot of pressure on him .
LARRY: I know . I just do n't have anyone else to talk to about it .
DEBBIE: You can talk to Claire .
LARRY: No . If I open up to her she 'll leave me .
DEBBIE: No , she wo n't , Larry , she loves you .
LARRY: I know , but there 's a certain point at which you just ca n't stay . I guess it 's hard to forgive somebody if they do n't formally apologize to you .
DEBBIE: Are you apologizing ?
LARRY: I 'm very close . Yes , I 'm sorry . And I 'm glad everybody 's okay .
DEBBIE: Thanks . She hugs him and starts to cry a little bit .
LARRY: I 'm off .
DEBBIE: Okay .
LARRY: This is awkward .
DEBBIE: What ?
LARRY: I need forty dollars for a cab .
DEBBIE: That 's funny .
LARRY: No , I 'm not kidding . You drove me . I was n't prepared .
DEBBIE: I only have a hundred .
LARRY: That 's okay . I 'll bring you the change .
OLIVER: I do n't get it .
SADIE: See , it 's not sad , it 's happy ecause they helped each othe achieve their destiny .
OLIVER: Oh .
CHARLOTTE: Great . I 'm going to have some freaky ass nightmares .
DEBBIE: I really liked our lives so much etter before we tried to change everything . I 'm sorry .
PETE: No . I 'm sorry . I do n't want to keep anything from you . I love you . You 're my wife . I just did n't want to let you down .
DEBBIE: Are you mad that I 'm pregnant ?
PETE: No . I 'm not mad . I 'm thrilled .
DEBBIE: You do n't feel trapped ?
PETE: Sometimes I feel like I trapped you .
DEBBIE: I do n't feel trapped .
PETE: Really ?
DEBBIE: No .
PETE: You should , because I 've trapped you . You ca n't go anywhere . I 'm going to get you pregnant every ten years for the rest of your life . You can never leave me . Ever .
DEBBIE: I never feel trapped by you . I 'm so happy to be with you . I love you so much . You 're my favorite person in the whole world . god damn it , why am I crying like this ? Something is wrong with me .
PETE: You 're pregnant .
DEBBIE: Oh , yeah . Shit . I was just outside telling your dad that I liked him . What if he thinks I like him now ?
PETE: No , he wo n't think that .
DEBBIE: I do n't want him to think I like him that much .
PETE: It 'll never happen .
DEBBIE: Can you believe it ? This is the craziest thing ever . What are we going to do with a third baby ?
PETE: I have no idea . How are we going to afford it ?
DEBBIE: We 'll sell the house .
PETE: We do n't have to .
DEBBIE: We kind of do .
PETE: We kind of do .
DEBBIE: We 'll make new memories in a new house .
PETE: I love you .
DEBBIE: Is there anything you want to do for your birthday ? It 's been the worst birthday ever .
PETE: There is one thing , but I do n't think you 'll like it .
DEBBIE: What ?
PETE: I would n't mind going to see some music . Would you want to do that ?
DEBBIE: Yeah .
PETE: Really ? I do n't believe you , but you 're sweet for saying that .
DEBBIE: How do we break you out of here ?
PETE: I can just leave on my own volition . It 's not a mental institution .
DEBBIE: Can you ?
PETE: It 's not like One Flew Over the Cuckoo 's Nest . Please do n't put a pillow over my face . Debbie laughs .
DEBBIE: Let 's get out of here , McMurphy .
PETE: You got it , Chief . Will you carry me ?
DEBBIE: I like this song .
PETE: Really ?
DEBBIE: Yeah . Why ? Pete smiles .
PETE: Ryan Adams ? No , he would n't sign with me .
DEBBIE: Why not ? You 're the best .
PETE: Well , he is in between labels . Let 's go try and talk to him afte the show .
JANE: Hurry !
SELVIG: Thanks . So what 's this `` anomaly '' � of yours supposed to look like ?
JANE: It 's a little different each time . Once it looked like , I do n't know , melted stars , pooling in a corne of the sky . But last week it was a olling rainbow ribbon
GENTLY TEASING: `` Racing `` ˜round Orion ? `` � I 've always said you should have been a poet .
JANE: Hey , Darcy . Pass up the bubbly and my gloves , will you ?
SELVIG: I recognize those . Think how proud he 'd be to see you now . Jane 's grin fades to a sad smile .
JANE: Thank you .
SELVIG: For what ?
JANE: The benefit of the doubt .
DARCY: Jane ?
JANE: There 's got to be some new variable Or an equipment malfunction
DARCY: I do n't think there 's anything wrong with your equipment
JANE: What ? !
DARCY: I think you want to see this .
JANE: Holy . Shatner .

JANE: No yes ! Let 's go !
SELVIG: That 's debateable . Put your seat elt on ! 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 3A . The SUV lurches .

DARCY: Yeah , right ! Good one ! Oh God , you 're serious
JANE: You want those college credits o not ?
DARCY: Keep the credits . I 'll intern at Burger King .
JANE: What are you doing ? !
DARCY: Saving our lives !
DARCY: I think that was legally you fault .
JANE: Get the first aid kit .
DARCY: Wow . Does he need CPR ? Because I know CPR .
DREAMILY: are beautiful .
JANE: are dilating . That 's a good sign .
SELVIG: We still have to get him to a hospital .
HOPEFULLY: After we get a reading on the storm ?
SELVIG: Immediately , Jane .
JANE: Where did he come from ?
ODIN: Do you think he 's ready ?
FRIGGA: He thinks he is . He has his father 's confidence .
ODIN: He 'll need his father 's wisdom .
FRIGGA: And his humility ? Odin reacts .
ODIN: Yes , but Thor 's still a boy . He could be a great King
QUIETLY: if we only had more time .
FRIGGA: For once , our son needs something we can not provide .
ODIN: I can fight it a little longer
FRIGGA: No . You 've put it off too long ! I worry for you . He touches her cheek .
ODIN: I 've destroyed demons and monsters , devastated whole worlds , laid waste to mighty kingdoms , and still you worry for me ?
FRIGGA: Always .
ODIN: Not today . Now come kiss you king while I 'm still king . He pulls her close , and they kiss .
THOR: Another ! 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 8A .
TO THOR: Nervous , brother ? 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 9 .
THOR: Have you ever known me to be nervous ?
LOKI: There was the time in Nornheim
THOR: That was n't nerves , brother . It was the rage of battle . How else could I have fought my way through a hundred warriors and pulled us out alive ?
LOKI: As I recall , I was the one who veiled us in smoke to ease ou escape .
THOR: Some do battle , others just do tricks .
LOKI: Just a bit of fun . Right , my friend ?
THOR: You do n't really want to start this again , do you , Cow ?
LOKI: I was being sincere !
THOR: You 're incapable of sincerity .
LOKI: Am I ?
THOR: Thank you .
LOKI: Give us a kiss .
THOR: Stop .
LOKI: Like a king . They hear the blast of a CEREMONIAL HORN .
THOR: You go ahead . Loki casts him a wary look .
FANDRAL: Thank you , love .
SIF: I 'll miss you .
VOLSTAGG: I hope this goes quickly . I 'm famished .
FEIGNED DISBELIEF: Noooo !
VOLSTAGG: Are you attached to that pretty face of yours ? Because one more word , and you wo n't be .
FANDRAL: My , we are hungry , are n't we ?
SIF: Fandral , is it true the famous Warriors Three are ready to meet any challenge ?
FANDRAL: Name it , Lady Sif .
SIF: Keep your mouth shut . 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 12 .
FRIGGA: It 's all right to be nervous .
THOR: Why does everyone keep saying that ? I 'm not nervous !
FRIGGA: You may be able to fool the rest of
THOR: but never you . I know .
FRIGGA: Thor , just remember that you have something even the great Allfathe never had .
THOR: And what is that ?
FRIGGA: Me for a mother . She smiles .
VOLSTAGG: Where is he ?
LOKI: He said he 'd be along .
VOLSTAGG: What ?
SIF: He wants to make an entrance .
FANDRAL: Well , if he does n't show up soon , he should n't bother . Odin looks like he 's ready to feed him to his avens .
LOKI: I would n't worry . Father will forgive him . He always does . 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 13 .
SIF: Oh , please .
ODIN: Gungnir . Its aim is true , its power strong . With it I have defended Asgard and the lives of the innocent across the Nine Realms since the time of the Great Beginning . And though the day has come for a new King to wield his own weapon that duty remains the same . Thor Odinson , my heir , my first-born .
ODIN: Today I entrust you with the greatest honor in all the Nine Realms . The sacred throne of Asgard . I have sacrificed much to achieve peace . So , too , must a new generation sacrifice to maintain that peace . Responsibility , duty , honor . These are not merely virtues to which we must aspire . They are essential to every soldie and to every King .
THOR: I swear .
ODIN: Do you swear to preserve the peace ?
THOR: I swear .
ODIN: Do you swear to cast aside all selfish ambition and pledge yourself only to the good of all the Realms ? Beat .
THOR: I swear .
ODIN: Then on this day , I , Odin Allfather , proclaim you
REALIZING: Frost giants
SIF: The Destroyer .
AWED: I thought it was but a legend .
FANDRAL: I 've never been inside the Vault efore . It 's said the Tesseract was once held here .
AWED: The Tesseract ? I thought that was ut a legend too !
SIF: Shush ! Odin surveys the destruction .
THOR: The Jotuns must pay for what they 've done ! 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 16A .
ODIN: They have paid with their lives . The Destroyer did its job , and the Casket is safe . All is well .
THOR: `` All is well ? ! `` � They broke into the Weapons Vault ! If the Frost Giants had stolen even one of these
ODIN: But they did n't .
THOR: I want to know why they
THOR: And if you had n't taken it from them they would have laid waste to all the Nine Realms !
ODIN: I have a truce with Laufey , the Jotun King .
THOR: He just broke your truce ! We must act ! Odin turns to Sif and the Warriors Three .
ODIN: Leave us .
THOR: March into Jotunheim as you once did , teach them a lesson , break their spirits so they 'll never dare try to cross our borders again !
ODIN: You 're thinking only as a warrior ! 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 16B .
THOR: This was an act of war !
ODIN: It was the act of but a few , doomed to fail .
THOR: They got this far !
ODIN: We will find the breach in ou defenses . It will be found , and it will be sealed . 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 17 .
THOR: As King of Asgard , I would
ODIN: You are not King . Not yet .
SIF: Redecorating , are we ?
VOLSTAGG: What 's this ? !
HOGUN: I told you they 'd cancel it .
FANDRAL: We thought that was just you being your normal cheery self . Volstagg looks about the floor , despairing .
VOLSTAGG: All this food so innocent , cast to the ground . It breaks the heart !
THOR: It 's unwise to be in my company ight now , brother . 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 18 .
LOKI: Who said I was wise ?
THOR: This was to be my day of triumph .
LOKI: It will come . In time .
ADMITS: If it 's any consolation , I think you 're right . About the Frost Giants , about Laufey , everything . If a few of them could penetrate the defenses of Asgard once , who 's to say they wo n't try again . Next time with an army ?
THOR: Yes , exactly !
LOKI: But there 's nothing we can do without defying Father .
THOR: It 's the only way to ensure the safety of our borders .
LOKI: It 's madness !
VOLSTAGG: Madness ? What sort of madness ?
LOKI: Nothing ! Thor was making a jest !
THOR: The safety of our Realm is no jest . We 're going to Jotunheim . 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 19 .
FANDRAL: What ? !
SIF: Thor , of all the laws of Asgard , this is one you must not break . Loki looks on , intrigued by the proceedings .
FANDRAL: This is n't like a journey to Earth , where you summon a little lightning and thunder and the mortals worship you as a god . This is Jotunheim .
VOLSTAGG: And if the Frost Giants do n't kill you , your Father will !
THOR: My father fought his way into Jotunheim , defeated their armies , and took their Casket ! We 'd just e looking for answers .
SIF: It is forbidden !
THOR: My friends , have you forgotten all that we 've done together ? He turns to Fandral .
FANDRAL: You did .
TO HOGUN: Who led you into the most glorious of battles
TO VOLSTAGG: and to delicacies so succulent , you thought you 'd died and gone to Valhalla ? 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 19A .
THOR: And who proved wrong all who scoffed at the idea that a young maiden could be one of the fiercest warriors this Realm has ever known ?
SIF: I did .
QUICKLY: True . But I supported you My friends , trust me now . We must do this .
LOKI: What ?
THOR: You are coming with me
LOKI: Yes , of course ! I wo n't let my other march into Jotunheim alone . I will be at his side .
VOLSTAGG: And I .
FANDRAL: And I . 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 20 .
HOGUN: And I . The Warriors Three fight together .
SIF: I fear we 'll live to regret this .
VOLSTAGG: If we 're lucky .
THOR: We must first find a way to get past Heimdall .
VOLSTAGG: That will be no easy task . It 's said the Gatekeeper can see a single dew drop fall from a blade of grass a thousand worlds away .
FANDRAL: And he can hear a cricket passing gas in Niffelheim .
VOLSTAGG: Jest not ! He heareth all !
FANDRAL: Please . Getting past him should be simple enough now , since he seems to be letting Frost Giants sneak by under his nose . Volstagg , terrified , calls out to the sky .
VOLSTAGG: Forgive him ! He meaneth no offense !
LOKI: Keep your weapons sheathed and you mouths closed . This is going to take subtlety and sincerity , not ute strength . Leave it to me . Loki dismounts and steps forward .
HEIMDALL: You 're not dressed warmly enough . Thor , Loki , and the others trade looks .
LOKI: I 'm sorry ?
HEIMDALL: The freezing cold of Jotunheim . It will kill you all in time , even Thor .
THEN: You think you can deceive me ? I , who watch all ? I , who can sense the flapping of a butterfly 's wings a thousand worlds away ? He fixes his eyes pointedly at Fandral .
FANDRAL: That was just a bit of a jest , eally Loki goes into damage control .
LOKI: You must be mistaken . We 're not
STEPPING FORWARD: Enough .
TO HEIMDALL: Heimdall , may we pass ? Heimdall stares him down .
HEIMDALL: For ages have I guarded Asgard and kept it safe from those who would do it harm . In all that time , never has an enemy slipped by my watch until this day . I wish to know how that happened .
THOR: Then tell no one where we 've gone until we 've returned .
VOLSTAGG: What happened ? Your silver tongue turn to lead ?
LOKI: Get me off this bridge before it cracks under your girth . Volstagg and Fandral share a laugh .
HEIMDALL: Be warned . I will honor my sworn oath to protect this Realm as its Gatekeeper . If your return threatens the safety of Asgard , Bifrost will remain closed to you . You 'll be left to die in the cold wastes of Jotunheim .
THOR: I have no plans to die today .
HEIMDALL: None do .
VOLSTAGG: Could n't you just leave the bridge open for us ?
HEIMDALL: To keep this bridge open would unleash the full power of the Bifrost and destroy Jotunheim with you upon it .
VOLSTAGG: Ah . Never mind , then .
THOR: Come on . Do n't be bashful .
VOLSTAGG: This belt ! This belt is now my lucky belt ! I will never remove it ! Even when bathing !
FANDRAL: You bathe ?
HOGUN: We should n't be here .
THOR: Too late now .
FANDRAL: Actually , it 's not . We could turn ight around , hop back to Asgard , share a mug by the fire . Could be nice .
LOKI: Perhaps we should wait . Thor turns back to his brother .
THOR: For what ?
LOKI: To survey the enemy . To gauge their strengths and weaknesses from a distance . 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 25 .
VOLSTAGG: I 'm liking that . Gauging , surveying . Particularly the distance part .
THOR: We know all we must . It 's time to act .
SIF: He 's just got to swing his hammer
THOR: It feels good , does n't it ? To be together again , adventuring on another world ?
FANDRAL: Adventuring ? Is that what we 're doing ?
THOR: What would you call it ?
FANDRAL: Freezing .
VOLSTAGG: Starving .
SIF: Whining .
THOR: How about a song to lift ou spirits ? The others groan .
HOGUN: No , not that ! 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 25A .
SIF: Please do n't make us sing again !
FANDRAL: If I have to listen to Volstagg 's singing voice one more time , I 'll fall on my own sword !
SIF: Well , now I 'm on board . She and Thor share a grin .
THOR: Hiding . As cowards always do .
JOTUN SENTRY: What is your business here , Asgardian ?
THOR: I speak only to your King . Not to his foot soldiers .
LAUFEY: I am Laufey , King of this Realm .
THOR: And I am
LAUFEY: We know who you are , Odinson . Why have you brought the stench of you lood into my world ?
THOR: I demand answers .
LAUFEY: You `` demand ? `` �
THOR: How did your people get into Asgard ?
LAUFEY: The house of Odin is full of traitors .
THOR: Do not dishonor my father 's name with your lies .
LAUFEY: Your father is a murderer and a thief . He stole what was ours , and left our world in ruins . We have the right to reclaim the Casket . 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 27 .
THOR: Not when you 'd use it to make wa against other Realms . Laufey laughs , cold , mocking .
LAUFEY: And why have you come here ? To make peace ? You long for battle . You crave it . I see you for what you are , Thor Odinson . Nothing but a boy , trying to prove himself a man .
THOR: This boy has grown tired of you mockery .
LOKI: Thor , stop and think . Look around you . We are outnumbered .
THOR: Know your place , brother
LAUFEY: You should listen to his counsel . You know not what your actions would unleash . Laufey steps out of the shadows .
LOKI: We will accept your most gracious offer .
JOTUN: Run back home , little princess .
LOKI: Damn .
VOLSTAGG: Silly hammer ! Has a mind of its own !
FANDRAL: I 'm hoping that 's just decorative .
THOR: Next ! Fandral calls to Volstagg and Hogun .
FANDRAL: Well ? What move , do you think ?
VOLSTAGG: I say we use `` The Norn 's Revenge . `` �
FANDRAL: At this close range ? I think `` The Alfheim Lunge '' � is a better move .
DISGUSTED: Maybe if they were three feet tall ! No ! How about `` The Randy Valkyrie '' � ? 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 28A .
HOGUN: Shut up !
SIF: If you do n't treat me like a lady , I wo n't act like a lady ! She takes out the Jotun .
LOKI: Pathetic .
THOR: Come on ! At least make it a challenge for me !
SIF: I 'm so glad I taught him how to do that !
VOLSTAGG: You may want to put some ice on that !
SIF: Of course you did .
VOLSTAGG: Hang on !
HOGUN: Watch the legs !
REALIZING: Right . Sorry .
FANDRAL: You really think your icicles are a match for Asgardian steel ?
VOLSTAGG: That 's unfortunate . He hurries to his wounded comrade .
FANDRAL: I may need a bit of help . Not a good look , is it ?
VOLSTAGG: Just try not to bleed .
FANDRAL: How 's the face ?
VOLSTAGG: Flawless .
THOR: Come on !
LOKI: That ca n't be good .
VOLSTAGG: Yes , it could ! Might be an early spring !
LOKI: Thor , we must go !
THOR: Then go !
SIF: There are too many of them !
THOR: I can stop them !
SIF: Thor !
VOLSTAGG: Run !
LOKI: Likely killed us all !
THOR: Loki , we have to see .
TO LOKI: Actually , could you bring the mists ack , please ?
ODIN: Laufey . End this .
LAUFEY: Your boy sought this out . 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 33 .
ODIN: You 're right . These are the actions of a boy . Treat them as such . You and I can stop this efore there 's further bloodshed .
LAUFEY: We are beyond diplomacy now , Allfather . He 'll get what he came for war and death . Odin looks grim , determined .
ODIN: So be it .
THOR: Now ! We 'll finish them together !
ODIN: Silence !
THOR: Why did you bring us back ?
ODIN: Do you realize what you 've done ? What you 've started ? 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 33A .
THOR: I was protecting my home . 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 34 .
ODIN: You can not protect your friends . How can you hope to protect a kingdom ? Odin turns to the others .
THOR: There wo n't be a kingdom to protect if you 're afraid to act ! Odin stares at him .
ODIN: That 's pride and vanity that talks ! Not leadership ! Have you forgotten everything I 've taught you ? What of a warrior 's patience , cunning ?
THOR: While you wait and be patient , the Nine Realms laugh at us ! The old ways are done . You 'd stand giving speeches while Asgard falls !
ODIN: You 're a vain , greedy , cruel boy !
THOR: And you are an old man and a fool !
ODIN: A fool , yes ! I was a fool to think you were ready . Loki takes a step towards Odin imploringly . 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 34A .
ODIN: Thor Odinson You have disobeyed the express command of your King . Through your arrogance and stupidity , you have opened these peaceful Realms and innocent lives to the horrors of war .
WHISPERING: Whosoever holds this hammer , if he e worthy , shall possess the powe of Thor .
THEN: Come on , big guy . Do me a favo and do n't be dead , okay ? Open you eyes and look at me .
TO SELVIG: Where did he come from ?
THOR: Hammer
DARCY: Yeah , we can tell you 're hammered . That 's pretty obvious .
JANE: Erik look at this .
SELVIG: Jane , we need get him to a hospital .
JANE: Not right now . It 'll take too long . County 's an hour away . We 'll drop him off after we 're done here . Selvig looks uncertain .
THOR: Father ! Heimdall ! I know you can hear me ! Open the bridge !
JANE: Okay , you and Darcy take him to the hospital , I 'll stay here .
SELVIG: You expect me to leave you alone in the middle of the desert ? Thor turns to the others , frustrated .
THOR: You ! What world is this ? The group is intimidated by his fervor .
SELVIG: It 's all right , my friend . We 're going to get you some help .
THOR: Where am I ? ! Answer me !
JANE: Erik , just back away
SELVIG: You 're in the desert outside the town of Puente Antiguo .
THOR: What Realm ? ! Alfheim ? Nornheim ?
DARCY: Uh New Mexico ?
THOR: You dare threaten Thor with so puny
DARCY: What ? He was freaking me out .
TO DARCY: Next time you decide to tase someone , do me a favor and make sure they 're already inside the truck .
TO JANE: Jane , come on
ADMISSIONS NURSE: Name ?
JANE: He said it was `` Thor . `` �
SPELLING: T-H-O-R. And your relationship to him ?
JANE: I 've never met him before .
DARCY: Until she hit him with the car .
JANE: Grazed him , actually .
THEN: Oh , and we tasered him , too .
SYMPATHETIC: Must have been quite the spat .
JANE: I told you , I do n't know him . I just want to make sure he 's okay .
ADMISSIONS NURSE: I 'm going to need a name and contact number .
JANE: Jane Foster .
SELVIG: Oh , for God 's sake
NURSE: Hi . Just taking a little blood .
THOR: How dare you attack the son of Odin !
NURSE: I need some help !
THOR: Then bring me a healing stone , you savages !
ORDERLY: What the hell is this guy on ?
THOR: You 're no match for the Mighty Thor struggles a beat , then passes out .
TOWNIE: Huh . 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 40A .
JANE: Darcy , when you 're done , take the soil samples to Professor Meyers in geology . Remind him , he owes me .
SELVIG: We might want to perform a spectral analysis .
JANE: `` We ? `` �
SELVIG: I flew all the way out here might as well make myself useful .
JANE: You know what would be really useful ? Do you still have that friend at LIGO ?
SELVIG: She was more than a friend .
JANE: Could you call in a favor ?
SELVIG: You do n't think this was just a magnetic storm ? 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 41A .
JANE: If I 'm right , their observatory must have picked up gravitational waves during last night 's event .
SELVIG: Meaning ?
JANE: Meaning these anomalies might signify something bigger .
SELVIG: How `` big '' � are we talking about ?
JANE: I think the lensing around the edges is characteristic of an Einstein-Rosen Bridge .
DARCY: A what ?
SELVIG: I thought you were a science major .
DARCY: Political Science .
JANE: She was the only applicant .
TO DARCY: An Einstein-Rosen Bridge a `` theoretical '' � connection between two different points of space-time . Darcy stares blankly .
TO DARCY: A wormhole . 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 41B .
SELVIG: Stars .
JANE: Yes . But not our stars .
DARCY: Hey , check it out . Jane and Selvig examine the photo , amazed .
SELVIG: Is that ?
JANE: I think I left something at the hospital .
FRIGGA: How could you have done this ?
ODIN: Do you understand what he set in motion ? He 's taken us to the brink of war !
FRIGGA: But banishment ? You would lose him forever ? He 's your son !
ODIN: What would you have done ? 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 43 .
FRIGGA: I would not have exiled him to a world of mortals , stripped of his powers , to suffer alone . I would not have had the heart for such cruelty !
ODIN: That is why I 'm King .
THEN: I , too , grieve the loss of our son . But there are some things that even I can not undo .
FRIGGA: You can bring him back .
ODIN: No . His fate is in his own hands now .
THOR: It 's not possible .
ADMISSIONS NURSE: I 'm sorry , only relatives can visit patients .
THINKING FAST: But I 'm his wife .
ADMISSIONS NURSE: I thought you said you did n't know him . 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 43A .
JANE: I meant I barely know him anymore . The man he 's become . He 's changed . I mean , what woman really knows he husband , anyway ?
ADMISSIONS NURSE: None of us , dear . He 's in Room
JANE: Typical . I just lost my most important piece of evidence .
DARCY: So now what ?
JANE: We find him .
SELVIG: Did you see what he did in there ? I do n't know if finding him is the est idea .
JANE: I want to know what that thing was , and he may have the answers . We do n't have a choice .
DARCY: Oo-kay . She pulls out her taser and a can of mace .
SELVIG: So we 're just going to spend the est of the day looking for him ?
JANE: However long it takes .
THOR: Blue sky one sun This is Earth , is n't it ?
DARCY: I think you may have hit him with the car one time too many .
TO THOR: Let 's get you some clothes .
VOLSTAGG: We should never have let him go .
SIF: There was no stopping him .
FANDRAL: At least he 's only banished , not dead . Which is what we 'd all be if that guard had n't told Odin where we 'd gone .
VOLSTAGG: How did the guard even know ? Loki stares at his arm .
LOKI: I told him . 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 45A .
FANDRAL: What ?
LOKI: I told him to go to Odin after we 'd left . Though he should be flogged for taking so long . 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 46 .
VOLSTAGG: You told the guard ?
LOKI: I saved our lives ! And Thor 's . I had no idea Father would banish him for what he did .
SIF: Loki , you 're the only one who can help Thor now . You must go to the Allfather and convince him to change his mind !
LOKI: And if I do , then what ? I love Thor more dearly than any of you , ut you know what he is . He 's arrogant . He 's reckless . He 's dangerous . You saw how he was today . Is that what Asgard needs from its King ?
SIF: He may speak about the good of Asgard , but he 's always been jealous of Thor .
VOLSTAGG: True , but we should be grateful to him . He did save our lives .
HOGUN: Laufey said there were traitors in the House of Odin . The others turn to the usually quiet Hogun .
FANDRAL: Why is it every time you choose to speak , it has to be something dark and ominous ?
HOGUN: A master of magic could easily ing three Jotuns into Asgard .
VOLSTAGG: No ! Surely not ! 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 46A .
FANDRAL: Loki 's always been one fo mischief , but you 're talking about something else entirely . 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 47 .
SIF: Who else could elude Heimdall 's gaze with tricks of light and shadow ?
VOLSTAGG: The ceremony was interrupted just efore Thor was named King .
SIF: We should go to the Allfather .
FANDRAL: And tell him what ? `` Oh , by the way , we think your son just etrayed the throne . And do us a favor . Bring back Thor . There 's a good fellow ! `` �
SIF: It 's our duty . If any of ou suspicions are right , then all of Asgard is in danger .
LOKI: Am I cursed ?
ODIN: No . Put the Casket down .
LOKI: What am I ?
ODIN: You 're my son .
LOKI: What more than that ?
ODIN: No .
BEAT: In the aftermath of the battle , I went into the Temple , and I found a aby . Small for a giant 's offspring abandoned , suffering , left to die . Laufey 's son . Loki is sent reeling by the revelation .
LOKI: Laufey 's son
ODIN: You were an innocent child .
LOKI: You took me for a purpose , what was it ? Odin does n't answer .
ODIN: I thought we could unite ou kingdoms one day , bring about an alliance , bring about a permanent peace through you . But those plans no longer matter .
LOKI: So I am no more than another stolen elic , locked up here until you might have use of me .
ODIN: Why do you twist my words ?
LOKI: You could have told me what I was from the beginning . Why did n't you ?
ODIN: You are my son . My blood . I wanted only to protect you from the truth .
LOKI: Because I am the monster parents tell their children about at night ?
ODIN: Do n't
LOKI: It all makes sense now . Why you favored Thor all these years .
ODIN: Listen 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 48B .
LOKI: Because no matter how much you claim to `` love '' � me , you could neve have a Frost Giant sitting on the Throne of Asgard !
ODIN: Listen to me ! Loki strides away towards the exit .
LOKI: Guards !
EAGER TOWNIE: This 'll do it . He yells to the driver .
DARCY: You know , for a crazy homeless guy , he 's pretty cut .
JANE: Excuse me excuse me !
THOR: They will suffice .
JANE: You 're welcome . Now tell me
THOR: What does anyone do in the Bifrost ?
SELVIG: The Bifrost
JANE: What exactly is the Bifrost ?
IGNORING HER: This mortal form has grown weak .
FRIGGA: I asked him to be honest with you from the beginning . There should e no secrets in a family .
LOKI: So why did he lie ?
FRIGGA: He kept the truth from you so that you would never feel different . You are in every way our son , Loki , and we your family . You must know that . Loki takes this in , stares at Odin .
LOKI: How long will it last ? 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 53 .
FRIGGA: I do n't know . This time is different . We were unprepared .
LOKI: I never get used to seeing him like this . The most powerful being in the Nine Realms lying helpless until his body is restored .
FRIGGA: But he 's put it off for so long now , I fear
LOKI: What hope is there for Thor ?
FRIGGA: There 's always a purpose to everything your father does . Tho may yet find a way home .
JANE: Now tell us exactly what happened to you last night .
DARCY: And how you could eat an entire box of Pop-Tarts and still be this hungry .
THOR: This drink . I like it .
DARCY: Yeah , it 's great , is n't it ? Isabela makes the best coffee in town .
CALLS OUT: Another !
JANE: Sorry , Izzy . Little accident .
IN SPANISH: Yo voy a pagar la taza .
IN SPANISH: Did you see that ? The first time she brings a man in here , and he 's a lunatic !
JANE: What was that ?
THOR: It was delicious . I want another .
JANE: Then you should just say so !
THOR: I just did .
JANE: I mean ask for it . Nicely .
THOR: I meant no disrespect .
JANE: All right , then no more smashing , deal ?
THOR: You have my word .
JANE: Good . 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 55 .
ISABELA: Morning , Pete . Jake .
TOWNIE PETE: The usual , please , Izzy . Isabela pours them a couple cups of coffee .
ISABELA: What crater ?
TOWNIE PETE: They 're saying some kind of satellite crashed in the desert .
JANE: Excuse me , did you say there was a satellite crash ?
REALIZING: I 'm probably sterile now .
DARCY: Oh my God , this is going on Facebook . Darcy whips out her cellphone .
TO THOR: Smile ! 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 55A .
SELVIG: What did the satellite look like ?
THOR: Where ? !
PETE: I would n't bother ! Looked like the whole Army was coming in when we left !
JANE: Where are you going ?
THOR: Twelve miles east of here .
JANE: Why ?
THOR: To get what belongs to me .
JANE: So now you own a satellite ?
THOR: It 's not what they say it is .
JANE: Whatever it is , the government seems to think it 's theirs . You intend to just walk in there and take it ?
THOR: Yes . He stops walking . 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 57 .
JANE: Everything ?
THOR: All the answers you seek will be yours , once I reclaim Mjolnir . Darcy looks to the others .
DARCY: `` Myeu-muh ? `` � What 's `` Myeu-muh ? `` �
SELVIG: Jane .
TO JANE: Please do n't do this .
JANE: You know what we saw last night . This ca n't be a coincidence . I want to know what 's in that crater .
SELVIG: I 'm not talking about the crater . I 'm talking about him .
JANE: He 's promised us answers .
SELVIG: He 's delusional ! Listen to what he 's saying ! `` Thor . `` � `` Bifrost . `` � `` Mjolnir . `` � These are the stories I grew up with as a child !
JANE: I 'd just be driving him out there , that 's all .
SELVIG: It 's dangerous . He 's dangerous . 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 58 .
JANE: I 'm sorry . I ca n't take you .
THOR: I understand . Then this is where we say goodbye . He takes her hand and kisses it .
JANE: That 's thank you . Thor bows slightly to each of them .
THOR: Jane Foster Erik Selvig Darcy . Farewell .
SELVIG: Now let 's get back to the lab . We have work to do .
SIF: Allfather , we must speak with you
VOLSTAGG: What is this ?
LOKI: My friends you have n't heard ? I am now Ruler of Asgard .
FANDRAL: Where is Odin ?
LOKI: Father 's fallen into the Odinsleep . My mother fears he may never awaken again .
SIF: We would speak with her .
LOKI: She has refused to leave my father 's bedside . You can bring your `` urgent '' � matter to me , you King . Sif covers quickly .
SIF: We would ask you to end Thor 's anishment . 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 60 .
LOKI: My first command can not be to undo the Allfather 's last . We 're on the ink of war with Jotunheim . Ou people must have a sense of continuity in order to feel safe in these difficult times .
FANDRAL: Of course .
JANE: Hey ! That 's my stuff !
COULSON: Ms. Foster , I 'm Agent Coulson , with
JANE: I do n't care who you work for , you ca n't do this !
SELVIG: Jane . This is more serious than you realize . Let it go .
JANE: Let it go ? ! This is my life !
COULSON: We 're here investigating a security threat . We need to appropriate your equipment and all you atmospheric data .
JANE: By `` appropriate '' � you mean `` steal ? `` �
COULSON: This should more than compensate you for your trouble .
JANE: I ca n't just pick up replacements from RadioShack ! I made most of that equipment myself !
COULSON: Then I 'm sure you can do it again .
JANE: And I 'm sure I can sue you fo violating my constitutional rights ! 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 61 .
COULSON: We 're the good guys , Ms. Foster .
JANE: So are we ! We 're on the verge of
UNDERSTANDING SOMETHING: extraordinary . Jane holds up her notebook .
COULSON: Thank you for your cooperation .
JANE: Years of research , gone . 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 62 .
DARCY: They even took my iPod .
SELVIG: And your back-ups ?
JANE: Look around ! They took our back- ups . They took the back-ups of ou ack-ups .
DARCY: I just downloaded , like , thirty songs on there .
TO DARCY: Will you please stop talking about your iPod ? !
TO SELVIG: Who are these people ?
SELVIG: No one knows much about them . But I knew a scientist a pioneer in gamma radiation . SHIELD showed up , and he was never heard from again .
JANE: I 'm not going to let them do this . I 'm getting everything back .
SELVIG: Please , let me contact one of my colleagues . Dr. Pym has had some dealings with these people . I 'll e- mail him and see if he can help .
DARCY: They took your laptop , too . Annoyed , Selvig thinks .
SELVIG: I 'll just be a minute .
THOR: I need a horse .
JANE: You still want a lift ?
READING: `` And though they 're large , giants can be quiet . You have to listen carefully for the sound of thei footsteps because they may be closer than you think . `` �
JANE: I 've never done anything like this efore ! Have you ever done anything like this before ? Thor looks amused by her excitement .
THOR: Many times . You 're brave to do it .
JANE: They just stole my entire life 's work . I really do n't have anything left to lose .
THOR: But you 're clever . Far more cleve than anyone else in this Realm .
JANE: `` This Realm ? `` � Why do you talk like that ?
THOR: You think me strange ? Jane laughs , catches herself .
JANE: Yeah . Just a little .
THOR: Good strange or bad strange ?
JANE: I 'm not quite sure yet .
THOR: You 'll see soon enough .
JANE: You promised me answers . 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 63B .
THOR: What you seek it 's a bridge .
JANE: A bridge ? Like an Einstein-Rosen Bridge ?
THOR: More like a rainbow bridge . 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 64 . A beat .
JANE: God , I hope you 're not crazy .
THOR: You 're going to need this .
JANE: Why ?
THOR: Stay here . Once I have Mjolnir , I will return what they stole from you . 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 64A .
JANE: No ! Look what 's down there ! You ca n't just walk in , grab our stuff , and walk out !
THOR: No . Jane looks relieved .
JANE: Wait
TECHIE: Feed from the keyhole . Can barely penetrate the cloud cover .
SITWELL: Reroute it , like all the others .
TECHIE: Right . Can I get the passengers some free drinks for the trouble ? Sitwell glares at him . 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 65A .
SHRUGS: It 'd be a nice gesture .
SITWELL: DeLancey , Jackson check it out .
AGENT DELANCEY: Jackson ?
SHIELD AGENT: Agents down ! We 've got a perimete each !
SITWELL: Get Coulson . Sitwell punches an alarm . 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 66A .
JANE: Erik , okay , first of all , do n't worry . I 'm perfectly fine , really . More sounds of MAYHEM come from the base .
COULSON: I want eyes up high . With a gun . Now ! 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 67B . 82E.a INT . SHIELD TRAILER 82E.a
THOR: You 're big . Thor grins .
JANE: No
COULSON: Barton
JANE: I ca n't just leave him there . 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 70 .
SELVIG: Why not ?
JANE: You did n't see what happened .
DARCY: Hey ! Myeu-muh !
SELVIG: In the children 's section . I wanted to show you how ridiculous his story was .
JANE: Are n't you the one who 's always told me to chase down all leads , all possibilities ?
SELVIG: I was talking about science , not magic !
JANE: Magic 's just science we do n't understand yet . Arthur C. Clarke .
SELVIG: Who wrote science fiction .
JANE: The precursor of science fact .
SELVIG: In some cases .
JANE: If that 's really an Einstein-Rosen Bridge out there , then there 's something on the other side .
SELVIG: Jane
DARCY: A primitive culture like the Vikings might have worshipped them as deities .
JANE: Yes ! Exactly ! Thank you ! Darcy beams . 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 71 .
SELVIG: Jane , if you do this , you 'll find yourself in a situation that I wo n't be able to get you out of this time .
DARCY: I 'll help you .
COULSON: It 's not easy to do what you did . You made us all look like a bunch of mall cops . That 's hurtful .
THEN: The men you so easily subdued are highly-trained professionals , and in my experience , it takes someone who 's received similar training to do what you did to them . Would you like to tell me where you received your training ? Thor sits silently .
THOR: Just a man .
COULSON: One way or another , we find out what we want to know . We 're good at that .
THOR: Loki ? What are you doing here ?
LOKI: I had to see you .
THOR: What 's happened ? Tell me ! Is it Jotunheim ? Let me explain to
LOKI: Father is dead . Thor stares at him , stunned .
THOR: What ?
LOKI: Your banishment , the threat of a new war , it was too much for him to ear .
THEN: It was cruel to put the hamme within your reach , knowing you could never lift it .
THOR: Can I come home ?
LOKI: The truce with Jotunheim is conditional upon your exile .
THOR: But could n't we find a way to
LOKI: Mother has forbidden your return . Thor nods , lowers his head , beaten .
THOR: No , I 'm sorry . Loki thank you for coming here .
LOKI: Nothing could have stopped me .
THOR: Good-bye .
COULSON: Good-bye ? I just got back . Thor looks up to see that Loki is gone .
COULSON: `` Donald Blake ? `` �
SELVIG: Doctor Donald Blake . He 's part of our team .
COULSON: You have dangerous coworkers , Dr. Selvig .
SELVIG: Troubled , not dangerous . He was distraught when he found out that you 'd taken all of our research . It was years of his life , gone ! He got depressed , started drinking , and well , you know the rest .
COULSON: Uh-huh . You mind if we take a moment to verify his identity ?
SELVIG: Certainly .
THEN: is how he described it .
COULSON: That does n't explain how he managed to tear through our security . Selvig shrugs .
SELVIG: Steroids . He 's a bit of a fitness nut . 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 74A .
COULSON: It says here he 's an M.D .
SELVIG: He is . That is , he was . He switched careers and became a physicist . He 's quite brilliant , eally .
THEN: If you would just release him to me , I promise to keep an eye on him .
COULSON: Release Dr. Blake to Dr. Selvig here . The Techie looks to him , surprised .
TO SELVIG: Make sure he stays in town for the next few days in case we need to talk to him again . Selvig shakes his hand .
SELVIG: Thank you .
COULSON: Just keep him away from the bars .
SELVIG: I will !
TO SELVIG: Where are we going ? Selvig drops his cool demeanor .
SELVIG: To get a drink . Selvig and Thor climb into the SUV .
COULSON: Follow them . 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 76 .
LAUFEY: Tell me why I should n't kill you .
LOKI: I 've come alone and unarmed .
LAUFEY: To what end ?
LOKI: To make you another proposition .
REALIZING: So you 're the one who let us into Asgard .
LOKI: You 're welcome .
LAUFEY: My men are dead , and I have no Casket . You are a deceiver .
LOKI: You have no idea what I am .
LAUFEY: Ah , the bastard son . I thought Odin had killed you . That 's what I would have done . He 's as weak as you are .
LOKI: No longer weak . I now rule Asgard , until Odin awakens . Perhaps you should not have so carelessly abandoned me . This gives Laufey pause .
LAUFEY: Or perhaps it was the wisest choice I 've ever made . I will hear you . 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 77 .
LOKI: I will conceal you and a handful of your soldiers , lead you into his chambers , and let you slay him where he lies . I 'll keep the throne , and you will have the Casket . Laufey studies Loki 's face .
LAUFEY: Why would you do this ?
LOKI: When all is done , we will have a permanent peace between our two worlds . Then I , the bastard son , will have accomplished what Odin and Thor never could .
LAUFEY: This is a great day for Jotunheim . Asgard is finally ours .
LOKI: No . Asgard is mine . The rest of the Nine Realms will be yours , if you do as you 're told . Laufey considers the proposition .
LAUFEY: I accept .
LOKI: What troubles you , Gatekeeper ? 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 78 .
HEIMDALL: I turned my gaze upon you in Jotunheim , but could neither see nor hear you . You were shrouded from me , like the Frost Giants who entered this Realm .
LOKI: Perhaps your senses have weakened after your many years of service .
HEIMDALL: Or perhaps someone has found a way to hide that which he does not wish me to see . Loki sizes him up , smiles .
LOKI: You have great power , Heimdall . Tell me , did Odin ever fear you ?
HEIMDALL: No .
LOKI: And why is that ?
HEIMDALL: Because he is my King , and I am sworn to obey him .
LOKI: Exactly . Just as you 're sworn to obey me now . Yes ? A beat .
HEIMDALL: Yes .
LOKI: Good . Then you will open the Bifrost to no one until I have undone what my brother has started .
SELVIG: Seems Darcy 's a terrible intern , ut a talented hacker .
THOR: Thank you for what you 've done .
SELVIG: Do n't thank me . I only did it fo Jane .
THOR: Are you in love with her ?
SELVIG: Of course not ! Jane 's like a daughter to me . Her father and I taught at University together . A good man , but he never listened . This registers with Thor .
THOR: Neither did I. Selvig eyes him with interest .
SELVIG: I do n't know if you 're really delusional , and I really do n't care at this point . I just care about her . I 've seen the way she looks at you .
THOR: I swear to you , I mean her no harm .
SELVIG: Good . If that 's the case , then I 'll buy you one more drink , and you 'll leave town tonight .
THOR: I had it all backwards . I had it all wrong .
SELVIG: It 's not a bad thing , finding out that you do n't have all the answers . That 's when you start asking the right questions . Thor takes this in .
THOR: For the first time in my life , I have no idea what I 'm supposed to do .
SELVIG: Anyone who 's ever going to find their way in this world has to start by admitting they do n't know where the hell they are . Thor nods .
THOR: I have no quarrel with you . But she 's a lady . You should be more espectful . 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 80A .
DRUNK TOWNIE: And you should shut the hell up , princess .
THOR: I will not fight him .
DRUNK TOWNIE: Then it 'll be easy to kick you ass . Selvig stands , steps between the two men .
SELVIG: Gentlemen , please . Let 's keep ou heads .
TO THOR: Another drink ?
SINGING: `` The mood is good , our hearts are full , there 's magic in the air . It 's all because we 're here tonight , and have n't got a care . So raise a glass , and toast to life , wherever it may lead / Tra-la- la , tra-la-la , a friend is fine indeed . / Tra-la-la , tra-la-la , a friend is fine indeed ! `` �
JANE: Erik !
TO THOR: Is he all right ?
THOR: He 's fine . Not injured at all . 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 81A .
JANE: What happened ?
THOR: We drank . We fought . He made his ancestors proud . 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 82 .
JANE: Put him on the bed .
SELVIG: I still do n't believe you 're the God of Thunder .
THEN: But you ought to be .
THOR: These are your chambers ?
JANE: Well , it 's more of a temporary living space , really . I do n't usually have visitors in here . Actually , never
THEN: I come up here a lot , now that I think about it .
THOR: You 've been very kind . I 've been far less grateful than you deserve .
JANE: I also hit you with my car a couple times , so it kind of evens out .
THOR: It was all I could get back . Not as much as I promised . I 'm sorry .
JANE: No , this is good . Thank you . This means I do n't have to start from scratch
THOR: What 's wrong ?
JANE: SHIELD , whatever they are . They 're never going to let this research see the light of day .
THOR: You must do this . You must finish what you 've started .
JANE: Why ?
THOR: Because you 're right . It 's taken so many generations for your people to get to this point . You 're nearly there . You just need someone to show you how close you eally are . 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 83 .
JANE: What is it ?
THOR: This is how my father explained it to me
THEN: Your world is one of the Nine Realms of the Cosmos , linked to each other by the branches of Yggdrasil , the Worlds Tree . Now , you see it every day , without ealizing . Images glimpsed through what did you call it ? this Hubble Telescope . So , Nine Realms
FANDRAL: Our dearest friend banished , Loki on the throne , Asgard on the brink of war , yet you manage to consume four wild boar , six pheasant , a side of beef , and two casks of ale . Shame on you ! Do n't you care ? !
VOLSTAGG: Do not mistake my appetite fo apathy .
SIF: Stop it , both of you ! We all know what we have to do , we 're just too damned afraid to do it !
DECIDES: We must go . We must find Thor .
FANDRAL: It 's treason , Hogun .
VOLSTAGG: To hell with treason , it 's suicide .
SUDDENLY NERVOUS: Now , shh ! Heimdall may be watching ! It 's said he can hear
FANDRAL: Yes , yes , we know !
SIF: Thor would do the same for us . An EINHERJAR GUARD enters . They tense .
EINHERJAR GUARD: Heimdall demands your presence . Volstagg quickly drains his flagon of ale .
VOLSTAGG: We 're doomed . 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 84A .
SELVIG: I need some coffee . The three head inside Smith Motors .
DARCY: Thanks .
THOR: You 're very welcome .
AGENT GARRETT: They want an update .
AGENT CALE: Tell them he 's eating eggs .
AGENT GARRETT: Scrambled or fried ? Cale glares at him .
DARCY: Sure .
THOR: Thank you . Excuse me a moment . Thor leaves .
ISABEL: Okay . Thank you .
THOR: If I may , I 'd like to come back fo more of your `` coffee . `` �
ISABEL: Any time .
VOLSTAGG: Good Heimdall , less us explain
HEIMDALL: You would defy the commands of Loki our King , break every oath you have taken as warriors , and commit treason to bring Thor back ? The four exchange nervous glances .
SIF: Yes , but
HEIMDALL: Good .
VOLSTAGG: So you 'll help us ?
HEIMDALL: I am bound by honor to our King . I can not open the Bifrost to you .
FANDRAL: Complicated fellow , is n't he ?
VOLSTAGG: Now what do we do ?
SIF: Look !
COULSON: What the hell was that ? 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 87 .
TECHIE: I do n't know , sir . We got massive energy readings out of nowhere , then they just disappeared . Fifteen miles due northwest .
COULSON: Let 's go take a look .
VOLSTAGG: He must have landed nearby . It 's time to put our tracking skills to work . Spread out . Check the sand for indentations of his boot prints .
FANDRAL: The winds would have blown them away by now . We should look fo signs of a campfire .
SIF: Or we could just start there .
FANDRAL: It 's worth a look , I suppose . The party tromps towards the town .
VOLSTAGG: There you go , lad !
SIF: It has been a thousand years
VOLSTAGG: Things change so fast here . You leave for a millennium , and it 's like the whole neighborhood 's gone . Volstagg sniffs , smells something .
AGENT GARRETT: Is there a Renaissance Faire in town ?
AGENT CALE: Call it in .
VOLSTAGG: Never cared for spies .
EINHERJAR GUARD: My liege , the Warriors Three and the Lady Sif have gone missing . Loki reacts . He knows who 's responsible .
HEIMDALL: Tell me , Loki , how did you get the Jotuns into Asgard ?
LOKI: You think the Bifrost is the only way in and out of the Realm ? There are secret paths between worlds to which even you with all your gifts are blind . But I have need of them no longer , now that I am King .
THEN: And I say , for your act of treason , you are relieved of your duties as Gatekeeper . And you are no longe a citizen of Asgard . 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 90 .
HEIMDALL: Then I need no longer obey you .
LOKI: Ensure my brother does not return .
THOR: My friends !
SELVIG: I do n't believe it
DARCY: Who are they ? 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 91 .
VOLSTAGG: Lady Sif and the Warriors Three . Surely you 've heard tales of Hogun the Grim , Fandral the Dashing , and I , Volstagg the Svelte ?
JANE: That would have been a thousand years ago ? Northern Europe ?
VOLSTAGG: Exactly ! Those lovely herring people . They worshipped us !
THOR: My friends , I 've never been happie to see anyone . But you should not have come .
FANDRAL: We 're here to take you home . Jane reacts to the news of Thor leaving .
THOR: You know I ca n't . My father is dead because of me . I must remain in exile . The other Asgardians exchange puzzled looks .
SIF: Thor your father still lives . Thor reacts to the revelation .
COULSON: Get somebody from Linguistics out here .
DARCY: Was somebody else coming ?
COULSON: I do n't think so . But the guy does n't tell me anything . 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 93 .
THOR: Leave this town now . Get yourself and your friends to safety .
JANE: What about you ?
THOR: I must stay and fight . The Asgardians look to Thor .
VOLSTAGG: You 're but a mortal now . You 'll get yourself killed !
FANDRAL: Or one of us , trying to protect you . 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 94 .
SIF: The best thing you can do is get the mortals to safety and leave the attle to us .
TO SIF: You 're right .
LOKI: Father . Welcome to Asgard .
SIF: Keep him distracted .
FANDRAL: What do you think ? `` The Svartalfheim Twist ? `` � `` Kiss of the Hag ? `` � `` Face Full of Boot ? `` � Volstagg grins eagerly .
VOLSTAGG: `` The Flying Mountain . `` � Hogun and Fandral groan .
FANDRAL: Not `` The Flying Mountain ! `` � It threw out my back for a year last time !
VOLSTAGG: Trust me , it 'll work .
TO JANE: My friends fight bravely , but they wo n't be able to hold it back much longer .
TO VOLSTAGG: Come on ! 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 96A . Volstagg takes off running at full speed .
VOLSTAGG: For Asgaaaaard ! ! ! 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 97 .
JANE: Erik !
TO JANE: Go ! Leave me ! 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 98 .
THOR: Come on give me one !
JANE: What are you doing ? What is that ? As the stone begins to glow , Thor crushes it .
SELVIG: I 'm really starting to like him . Jane turns to Thor to find he 's gone .
THOR: Go , while you can !
SIF: But the others
THOR: You ca n't help them now . Your jo is to survive . She struggles to sit up . 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 98A .
SIF: No ! I will die a warrior 's death . Stories will be told of this day He gently takes her shield from her .
THOR: Live and tell those stories yourself .
FANDRAL: No . We can still fight !
THOR: But not win . Move Volstagg , o he 'll die ! Thor looks at them , grins .
SELVIG: Jane , no !
JANE: Oh . My . God .
COULSON: Donald I do n't think you 've been completely honest with me .
DARCY: So , how can you speak our language ?
VOLSTAGG: Your language ? Ha ! Silly girl , you 're speaking ours . Thor calls up to the sky .
THOR: Heimdall ! Open the Bifrost !
VOLSTAGG: Then we 're trapped here forever .
FANDRAL: Then I suppose we 'd best start settling into our new lives . He looks to Darcy , turns on the charm .
DARCY: No . Thor shouts back up to the sky .
THOR: Heimdall !
VOLSTAGG: Primitive . Good enough for hunting small game , I suppose .
FANDRAL: Sorry , my love . These things happen . 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 103 .
THOR: Know this , son of Coul . You and I , we fight for the same cause the protection of this world . From this day forward , count me as you ally .
THEN: If you return the items you have stolen from Jane Foster .
COULSON: Not stolen . Borrowed .
THOR: Whatever fate lies before me , you are part of it .
LAUFEY: It 's said you can still see and hear what transpires around you , even in this state . I hope it 's true , so that you may know you death came by the hand of Laufey .
LOKI: And your death came by the son of Odin . 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 104A .
LOKI: Found its way back to you , did it ?
THOR: No thanks to you .
FRIGGA: What ?
THOR: Why do n't you tell her ? How you sent the Destroyer to kill ou friends ? To kill me ? Frigga looks to Loki , alarmed and confused .
LOKI: It must have been enforcing Father 's last command . 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 106 .
THOR: You 're a talented liar , brother . Always have been .
SMILES: It 's good to have you back .
DEAD SERIOUS: Now , if you 'll excuse me , I need to destroy Jotunheim .
THOR: Jotunheim
LOKI: All these years , and no one 's eve dared to use it as a weapon .
THOR: Why have you done this ?
LOKI: To do what Father never could . To destroy their kind forever . When he awakens , he 'll see the wisdom of what I 've done .
THOR: He wo n't ! You ca n't kill an entire ace !
LOKI: What is this newfound love for the Frost Giants ? You , who would have killed them all with your bare hands .
THOR: I 've changed .
LOKI: So have I. Loki hits Thor across the face with Gungnir .
THOR: Is the throne really worth what you 've done ? What you would ecome ?
LOKI: I never wanted the throne . I only wanted to be your equal . Now fight me ! 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 108 .
THOR: I will not fight you , brother .
LOKI: I am not your brother . I neve was .
THOR: Loki , this is madness Loki grins .
LOKI: Is it ?
SELVIG: Jane ? 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 108A .
JANE: Something 's wrong . 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 109 .
LOKI: If you care so much for the Jotuns , then die with them .
LOKIS: I was always more clever than you .
THOR: Yet still not clever enough .
LOKI: Look at you , the Mighty Thor . With all your strength , what good does it do you now ?
THOR: Forgive me .
ODIN: It is over .
JANE: It 's gone .
VOLSTAGG: and then , with a mighty bellow , I flew at the great metal beast and laid it low 4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 113 .
FANDRAL: Is that another way of saying you fell on your huge a
VOLSTAGG: As a matter of fact , falling down was a tactic . Lulling the Destroyer into a false sense of security !
FANDRAL: Well , I was the one who had to drag your enormous carcass off the attlefield . That makes me the eal hero . Does n't it , Hogun ? Hogun points to Volstagg .
HOGUN: Big stomach . Big mouth .
FANDRAL: Well , how about that ? A smile ! I 'd say that calls for anothe drink ! They laugh and raise another round .
SIF: My Queen . I am so sorry for you loss . Frigga takes Sif 's hand appreciatively .
FRIGGA: Thank you , Sif .
SIF: He mourns for his brother . And he misses her . The mortal .
FRIGGA: He will need his friends now more than ever .
SIF: I will always be at his side .
ODIN: You 'll be a wise King .
THOR: There will never be a wiser king than you . Or a better father .
THEN: I have much to learn . I know that now . But some day , perhaps , I will make you proud .
ODIN: You 've already made me proud . Odin leaves , Thor consoled by his words .
THOR: Can you see her ? Heimdall turns , gazes out towards Earth .
HEIMDALL: Yes .
THOR: How is she ?
DARCY: Here you go .
JANE: Thanks . Jane inserts the flash drive into the device .
DARCY: He would have come back if he could .
JANE: I know . But if he ca n't get here on his own
THOR: Now I know what you 're thinking . Oh no ! Thor 's in a cage . How did this happen ? Well , sometimes you have to get captured just to get a straight answer out of somebody . It 's a long story but basically I 'm a bit of a hero . See , I spent some time on earth , fought some robots , saved the planet a couple of times . Then I went searching through the cosmos for some magic , colorful Infinity Stone things did n't find any . That 's when I came across a path of death and destruction which led me all the way here into this cage where I met you .
SURTUR: I can not die . Not until I fulfill my destiny and lay waste to you home .
THOR: You know , it 's funny you should mention that because I 've been having these terrible dreams of late . Asgard up in flames , falling to ruins , and you Surtur are at the center of all of them .
SURTUR: Then you have seen Ragnarok , the fall of Asgard . The great prophecy
THOR: Oh , hang on . Give it a second . Once again , Thor is turning VERY SLOWLY .
SURTUR: A mountain !
THOR: The Eternal Flame that Odin keeps locked away on Asgard ? Surtur grins , evil .
SURTUR: Odin is not on Asgard . And you absence has left the throne defenseless . That elicits a concerned look from Thor .
THOR: Okay , so where is it ? This crown ?
SURTUR: This is my Crown , the source of my power .
THOR: Oh , that 's a crown ? I thought it was a big eyebrow .
SURTUR: It 's a crown .
THOR: Anyway , it sounds like all I have to do to stop Ragnarok is rip that thing off your head .
SURTUR: But Ragnarok has already begun . You can not stop it . I am Asgard 's doom , and so are you . All will suffer , all will burn .
THOR: That 's intense . To be honest , seeing you grow really big and set fire to a planet would be quite the spectacle . But it looks like I 'm going to have to go with option B where I bust out of these chains , knock that tiara off your head , and stash it away in Asgard 's vault .
SURTUR: You can not stop Ragnarok . Why fight it ?
THOR: Because that 's what heroes do .
SURTUR: You have made a grave mistake , Odinson .
THOR: I make grave mistakes all the time . Everything seems to work out . In the shadows , a massive FIRE DRAGON ROARS .
SKURGE: Heimdall was an idiot . This jo should have made him rich . Now , the job ai n't easy , but it does have its benefits . The Bi-Frost gives me access to everything the Nine Realms have to offer . I mean it 's all mine for the taking . Beholdmy stuff .
THOR: Heimdall , come on .
ASGARDIAN WOMAN: Skurge , is that important ?
SKURGE: You girls are in for a treat .
SKURGE: Girls ! Well well , look who decided to pop in . Thanks for scaring away my company and drenching my workplace in brains .
THOR: Who are you ?
SKURGE: Do n't you remember ? I 'm Skurge . We fought together on Vanaheim .
THOR: Right . Where 's Heimdall ?
SKURGE: That traitor . No one knows , he 's a fugitive of the throne .
THOR: Traitor ?
SKURGE: Yeah , you see , Odin charged Heimdall with negligence of duty , ut he disappeared before the trial . Hard to catch a guy who can see everything in the Universe .
THOR: Sure .
SKURGE: Hold on . I 'm supposed to announce your arrival .
THOR: What the hell is that ?
ACTOR LOKI: Oh , brother . This is it . I take my leave .
ACTOR THOR: You fool , you did n't listen !
ACTOR LOKI: I 'm sorry .
ACTOR THOR: Lady Sif ! Get help !
ACTOR SIF: Somebody help !
ACTOR LOKI: Sorry for all I 've done .
ACTOR THOR: It 's all right . Hold on .
ACTOR LOKI: I 'm sorry I tried to rule Earth .
ACTOR THOR: They 'd be lucky to have you .
ACTOR LOKI: I 'm sorry about that thing with the Tesseract . I just could n't help myself .
ACTOR THOR: I know .
ACTOR LOKI: I 'm a trickster .
ACTOR THOR: So mischievous .
ACTOR LOKI: Sorry about that time I turned you into a frog .
ACTOR THOR: It was a wonderful joke .
ODIN: Twas indeed hilarious .
ACTOR THOR: You are the savior of Asgard .
ACTOR LOKI: Tell my story .
ACTOR THOR: I will .
ACTOR LOKI: Build a statue for me .
ACTOR THOR: We will build a big statue for you .
ACTOR LOKI: With my helmet on , with the big endy horns .
ACTOR THOR: I will tell Father what you did here today .
ACTOR LOKI: I did n't do it for him . Actor Loki then `` dies '' .
ACTOR THOR: Noooooo ! ! !
ACTOR ODIN: And so Loki died of his wounds , giving his life for ours . He fought back those disgusting dark elves . He brought peace to the ealm .
ODIN: Bravo ! Bravo ! Well done . Bravo .
THOR: Father .
ODIN: Oh , shit . My son ! Thor has returned ! Greetings my boy .
THOR: It 's an interesting play . What 's it called ?
ODIN: The Tragedy of Loki of Asgard . The people wanted to commemorate him .
THOR: Indeed they should . I like that statue . A lot bette looking than he was when he was alive , though . A little less weasely . Less greasy maybe .
ODIN: So it 's back to Midgard for you , is it ?
THOR: Nope . I 've been having this eocurring dream lately .
ODIN: That 's just a silly dream Signs of an overactive imagination .
THOR: Possibly but then I decide to go out there and investigate . And what do I find , but the Nine Realms completely in chaos . Enemies of Asgard assembling , plotting ou demise , all while you , Odin , the protector of those Nine Realms , are sitting here in your bathrobe , eating grapes .
ODIN: Well , it is best to respect ou neighbors ' freedom .
THOR: Of course , the freedom to be massacred .
ODIN: Yes , besides , I have been rathe usy myself .
THOR: Watching theatre .
ODIN: Board meetings , and security council meetings
THOR: You really going to make me do it ?
ODIN: Do what ?
THOR: You know that nothing will stop Mjolnir as it returns to my hand .
ODIN: You 've gone quite mad . You 'll be executed for this !
THOR: Then I 'll see you on the othe sidebrother .
LOKI: Alright , I yield !
SKURGE: Behold ! Thor..Odinson .
LOKI: You had one job ! Just the one .
THOR: Where 's Odin ?
LOKI: You just could n't stay away , could you ? Everything was fine without you . Asgard was prospering You 've ruined everything . Ask them .
THOR: Where 's father ? Did you kill him ?
LOKI: You had what you wanted , you had the independence you asked for ! Thor PRESSES Mjolnir onto Loki 's chest .
THOR: Right here on the sidewalk ? O ight there , where the building that 's being demolished ? Great planning .
LOKI: How was I supposed to know ? Ca n't see into the future . I 'm not a witch .
THOR: Then why do you dress like one ?
LOKI: Hey .
THOR: I ca n't believe you 're alive . I saw you die . I mourned you , I cried fo you .
LOKI: I 'm honored .
THOR: Sure . Start figuring out where he is .
LOKI: This is n't me .
THOR: Loki ? He picks up the card . It reads 177A Bleecker Street Thor picks up the card and - WHOOSH !
STRANGE: The preferred term is `` Master of the Mystic Arts . ''
THOR: Alright wizard , who are you ? Why should I care ?
STRANGE: My name is Doctor Stephen Strange and I have some questions for you . Take a seat .
THOR: I do n't drink tea .
STRANGE: What do you drink ?
THOR: Not tea .
STRANGE: So I keep a watch list of individuals and beings from othe ealms that may be a threat to this world . Your adopted brother Loki is one of these beings .
THOR: He 's a worthy inclusion .
STRANGE: Then why bring him here ?
THOR: We 're looking for my father .
STRANGE: So . If you were to tell you where Odin was , all parties concerned would promptly return to Asgard ?
THOR: Promptly .
DR. STRANGE: Great . Then I 'll help you .
THOR: If you knew where he was , why did n't you call me ?
DR. STRANGE: I have to tell you , he was adamant that he not be disturbed . You father said he had chosen to remain in exile . And you do n't have a phone .
THOR: No , I do n't have a phone , but you could have sent an electronic letter . It 's called an email .
STRANGE: Yeah , do you have a computer ?
THOR: No . What for ? Anyway , my father is no longer in exile . So if you could tell me where he is , I can take him home .
DR. STRANGE: Gladly . He 's in Norway .
STRANGE: I 'm just seeing whether this incantation requires any Asgardian modifications .
THOR: Will you stop doing that ?
STRANGE: I need just one strand of you hair .
THOR: Let me explain something , my hai is not to be meddled wi- !
DR. STRANGE: He 's waiting for you .
THOR: All right .
STRANGE: Do n't forget your umbrella .
THOR: Yes .
DR. STRANGE: Yeah , right . Suddenly we hear SCREAMING .
LOKI: I have been fallingfor thirty minutes !
DR. STRANGE: You can handle him from here .
THOR: Yeah of course . Thank you very much for your help .
STRANGE: Good luck .
LOKI: Handle me ? Who are you ?
THOR: Loki .
LOKI: ..you think you 're some kind of sorcerer ? Do n't think for one minute , you second-rate
DR. STRANGE: Bye-bye . Strange GESTURES with both hands and- -WHOOSH ! PULLS the magic portal over them . Just like that , Thor and Loki are gone .
THOR: Father ?
ODIN: Look at this place . It 's beautiful .
THOR: Father , it 's us .
ODIN: My sons . I 've been waiting fo you .
THOR: I know . We 've come to take you home .
ODIN: Home , yes . Your mother , she calls me . Do you hear it ?
THOR: Loki , lift your magic .
ODIN: Took me quite a while to break free from your spell . Frigga would have een proud .
THOR: I know that we failed you , but we can make this right .
ODIN: I failed you . It is upon usRagnarok .
THOR: No , I 've stopped Ragnarok . I put an end to Surtur .
ODIN: No . It has already begun . She 's coming . My life was all that held her back , but my time has come . I can not keep her away any longer .
THOR: Father , who are you talking about ?
ODIN: The Goddess of Death . Hela . My first born . Your sister .
THOR: what ?
ODIN: Her violent appetites grew beyond my control . I could n't stop her , so I imprisoned her . Locked he away . She draws her strength from Asgardand once she gets there , her powers will be limitless .
THOR: Whatever she is , we can stop her . We can face her together .
ODIN: No we wo n't . I 'm on a different path now . This you must face alone .
LOKI: Brother .
THOR: This was your doing .
HELA: So he 's gone ? That 's a shame . I would 've liked to have seen that . A tense moment as they stare each other down .
THOR: You must be Hela . I 'm Thor , son of Odin .
HELA: Really , you do n't look like him .
LOKI: Perhaps we can reach an arrangement .
HELA: You sound like him .
LOKI: Beg your pardon ? Hela MANIFESTS a pitch black blade .
HELA: Kneelbefore your Queen .
THOR: I do n't think so . Thor winds up and HURLS Mjolnir at Hela
HELA: Darling , you have no idea what 's possible .
LOKI: Bring us back !
THOR: No ! ! Hela CHARGES Thor and Loki as-
VOLSTAGG: Who are you ! ? What have you done with Thor ?
HELA: I 'm Hela .
SKURGE: I 'm just a janitor . Skurge ever-so-slightly peers up at her .
HELA: You look like a smart boy with good survival instincts . How would you like a job ?
LEAD SCRAPPER: Are you a fighter or are you food ?
THOR: I 'm just passing through .
LEAD SCRAPPER: It is food . On your knees .
SCRAPPER #142: He 's MINE .
SCRAPPER: But we 've already got him .
SCRAPPER #142: Alright then I guess I go through you .
LEAD SCRAPPER: More food .
THOR: Thank you .
SCRAPPER #142: This is Scrapper 142 . I need clearance and an audience with the oss . I 've got something special .
THOR: Hey ! Where are you taking me ?
SCRAPPER #142: Many apologies , your majesty .
HELA: It 's come to my attention that you do n't know who I am .
HOGUN: Whoever you are whatever you 've done , surrender now ! Or we will show you know mercy .
HELA: Whoever I am ? Did you listen to a word I said ?
HOGUN: This is your last warning !
HELA: I thought you 'd be happy to see me . Hela forms her headdress .
HOGUN: Go back to whatever cave you crept out of you evil demoness !
HELA: Let 's go see my palace .
THOR: Whatthe hell ?
GRANDMASTER: He 's wonderful . It is a he ? Reveal S142 standing beside Thor .
SCRAPPER #142: It 's a he .
GRANDMASTER: Yeah . I love when you come to visit 142 , you bring me the best stuff . Whenever we get to talking , Topaz , about Scrapper 142what do I always say ? `` She is the '' and it starts with a B .
TOPAZ: Trash .
GRANDMASTER: No , not trash . Were you waiting just to call her that ? It does n't start with a `` B . ''
TOPAZ: Booze hag .
GRANDMASTER: I 'm so sorry . No , `` best . '' I was thinking about `` best . '' Because I always say you 're the est . She brought me my precious eloved Champion , you know .
TOPAZ: You say that every time she 's here .
GRANDMASTER: What have you brought today ? Tell me .
SCRAPPER #142: A contender .
THOR: A what ?
GRANDMASTER: I need to go closer . I want a closer look at this . Can you take us closer ? Thank you .
THOR: Just wait a damn minute . I 'm not for sale .
GRANDMASTER: Man . He is a fighter .
SCRAPPER #142: I 'd take 10 million .
TOPAZ: Tell her she 's dreaming .
GRANDMASTER: For heaven 's sake , transfer the units .
THOR: You 'll pay for this !
SCRAPPER #142: No , I got paid for this .
GRANDMASTER: Here 's what I wan na know . Who are you ?

THOR: Oh , my god ! Liquid Carlo spreads towards Grandmaster .
GRANDMASTER: I 'm stepping in it . I 'm stepping in it . Look out !
THOR: Oh , the smell .
GRANDMASTER: What does it smell like ?
TOPAZ: Burnt toast .
GRANDMASTER: What happened to my manners ? I have n't properly introduced myself . Come on . Follow me . Grandmaster gives Topaz back her staff .
THOR: We 're not friends , and I do n't give a shit about your games ! I 'm going ack to Asgard !
GRANDMASTER: Ass-gard ? One , two , three , four .
LOKI: There was a wormhole in space and time beneath me . At that moment , I let go .
THOR: Loki ! ? Loki ! Over here !
LOKI: Excuse me one second .
THOR: Loki !
LOKI: What ? You 're alive ?
THOR: Yes , of course I 'm alive .
LOKI: What are you doing here ?
THOR: What do you mean , what am I doing ? I 'm stuck in this stupid chair . Where 's your chair ?
LOKI: I did n't get a chair .
THOR: Get me out of this one .
LOKI: I ca n't .
THOR: What ?
LOKI: I 've made friends with this man . He 's called the Grandmaster .
THOR: Oh , he 's crazy !
LOKI: I 've gained his favor.. The Bi- Frost brought me out here weeks ago .
THOR: Weeks ago ? I just got here . Suddenly Grandmaster is right next to them .
GRANDMASTER: What are you whispering about ? Both Thor and Loki react , startled .
THOR: God of Thunder . Tell him .
LOKI: I 've never met this man in my life .
THOR: He 's my brother .
LOKI: Adopted .
GRANDMASTER: Is he any kind of a fighter ?
THOR: You take this thing out of my neck and I 'll show you .
GRANDMASTER: Now listen to that . He 's threatening me . Hey , Sparkles , here 's the deal . If you wan na get ack to Ass-place , Assberg
THOR: Asgard .
GRANDMASTER: Any contender who defeats my champion , their freedom they shall win .
THOR: Fine . Then point me in the direction of whoever 's ass I have to kick .
GRANDMASTER: That 's what I call , contender ! Direction would be this way , Lord .
THOR: Loki !
KORG: Hey ! Take it easy man ! Over here . The pile of rocks waving at you . Yeah I 'm actually a thing , I 'm a being . Allow me to introduce myself , my name is Korg . I 'm kind of like the leader in here . I 'm made of rocks , as you can see , but do n't let that intimidate you . You do n't need to e afraid unless you 're made of scissors . Just a little rock-paper-scisso joke for you . This is my very good friend over here , Miek . He 's an insect and has knives for hands .
THOR: You 're a Kronan , are n't you ?
KORG: That I am .
THOR: How 'd you end up in here ?
KORG: Well , I tried to start a revolution ut did n't print enough pamphlets , so hardly anyone turned up .
THOR: How did you
KORG: Yeah , no . This whole thing is a circle . But not a real circle , more like a freaky circle .
THOR: This does n't make any sense .
KORG: No , nothing makes sense here . The only thing that does make sense , is that nothing makes sense .
THOR: Has anyone here fought the Grandmaster 's Champion ?
KORG: Doug has . Doug ! Oh , right , Doug 's dead . That 's ight . Everyone who fights the Grandmaster 's champion perishes .
THOR: What about you ? You 're made of ocks .
KORG: Perishable rocks . There you go . Another one gone . Yeah , no , I just do the smalle fights , warm up the crowd and whatnot . Wait . You 're not gon na face him , are you ?
THOR: Yes I am . Fight him , win , and get the hell out of this place .
KORG: That 's exactly what Doug used to say . See you later , new Doug . Korg walks away and approaches Miek .
HELA: Does no one remember me ? Has no one been taught our history ? Look at these lies . Goblets and garden parties ? Peace treaties ? Hela leads them towards the throne .
SKURGE: Odin 's treasures .
HELA: Fake . Hela KNOCKS the gauntlet off its pedestal .
THOR: Odin , I bid you take your place in the halls of Valhalla Where the brave shall live forever . Nor shall we mourn but rejoice-
LOKI: You know , I have n't seen this Beloved Champion he talks of , but I 've heard he 's astonishingly savage . I 've placed a large wage against you tomorrow . Do n't let me down .
KORG: Piss off , ghost ! He 's freaking gone .
THOR: No .
KORG: Yeah , not really useful unless you 're fighting off three vampires that were huddled together .
THOR: I really wish I had my hammer .
KORG: Hammer ?
THOR: Quite unique . It was made from this special metal from the heart of a dying star . And when I spun it really , really fast it gave me the ability to fly .
KORG: You rode a hammer ?
THOR: No , I did n't ride the hammer .
KORG: The hammer rode you on your back ?
THOR: No . I used to spin it really fast , and it would pull me off the
KORG: Oh my God . The hammer pulled you off ?
THOR: The ground . It would pull me off the ground , up into the air , and I would fly . Every time I threw it , it would always come back to me .
KORG: Sounds like you had a pretty special and intimate relationship wiht this hammer and that losing it was almost comparable to losing a loved one .
THOR: That 's a nice way of putting it .
SCRAPPER #142: I said they 're mine .
THOR: See her , the one that put me in here .
KORG: Yeah , Scrapper 142 . She 's strong . And she drinks a lot .
THOR: Asgardian ?
SCRAPPER #142: Are you done ?
THOR: Please , help me . I need your help .
SCRAPPER #142: Bye .
THOR: Fine , then you must be a traitor o a coward because the Valkyrie are sworn to protect the throne .
SCRAPPER #142: Listen closely , your majesty . This is Sakaar , not Asgard . And I 'm a scrapper , not a Valkyrie . Guards swarm Thor , dragging him back
VALKYRIE: And no one escapes this place . So you 're gon na die anyway .
STAN LEE: Now , do n't you move . My hands ai n't as steady as they used to be .
THOR: By Odin 's beard , you shall not cut my hair lest you feel the wrath of the might Thor .
GRANDMASTER: Wow ! Look at all of you . What a show , WHAT-A-NIGHT ! Who 's having fun ? Please , I 'm your host . Big ound of applause for all of ou undercard competitors who died so gruesomely . Good sports . What a show ! What a night ! This is what you 've come for and so have I . And now , without further ado it 's main event time ! !
INSANE APPLAUSE: Making his first appearance , though he looks quite promising , got a couple of tricks up his sleeve . I 'll say no more , see what you think . Ladies and gentlemen I give to youLord of Thunder !
THOR: Yes !
LOKI: I have to get off this planet .
GRANDMASTER: Hey , hey , hey ! Where are you going ?
THOR: Hey ! We know each other . He 's a friend from work . Where have you been ? Everybody thought you were dead . So much has happened since I last saw you . I lost my hammer . Like , yesterday , so that 's still pretty fresh . Loki ! Loki 's alive . Can you elieve it ? He 's up there . Loki ! Look who it is !
HULK: NO BANNER ! ONLY HULK !
THOR: What are you doing ? It 's me .
GRANDMASTER: Here we go .
THOR: Hey , big guy . The sun 's getting eal low .
LOKI: Yes ! That 's how it feels ! I 'm just a huge fan of the sport . Thor is SMASHED into the floor face first . Hulk ROARS and RUSHES Thor with his axe .
THOR: All right . Screw it .
CROWD: Thunder ! Thunder ! Thunder !
KORG: Thunder ! Thunder ! Thunder !
HELA: What is that noise ?
SKURGE: The common folk are n't exactly falling in line . There 's a esistance trying to knock down the front gates .
HELA: Tell me about yourself , Skurge .
SKURGE: Well , me dad was a stonemason , me mum was-
HELA: I 'll just stop you there . What I meant was what is your ambition ?
SKURGE: I just want a chance to prove myself .
HELA: Recognition . When I was young every great King had an executioner . Not just to execute people , but also to execute their vision . But mainly to execute people . Still a great honor . I was Odin 's executioner .
HEIMDALL: Excuse me .
THOR: Are we cool ? Hulk grunts . I guess so .
HULK: Like what ?
THOR: Like this . Big , green , stupid .
HULK: Hulk always Hulk .
THOR: How 'd you get here ?
HULK: Winning .
THOR: You mean cheating ?
HULK: Quinjet . Hulk mimes a plane landing in the water .
THOR: Yes . Where is the Quinjet now ? Hulk stands up , and exits the hot tub , naked .
HULK: Quinjet .
THOR: Yes ! I 'm getting us out of here . This is a terrible , awful place . You 're gon na love Asgard . It 's ig . It 's golden . Shiny . Hulk sits on his bed , eating a pumpkin .
HULK: Hulk stay .
THOR: No , no , no . My people need me to get back to Asgard . We must prevent Ragnarok .
HULK: Rag-na-ruh ?
THOR: The prophesied death of my home world , the end of days , it 's the end of- If you help me get back to Asgard , I can help you get back to Earth .
HULK: Earth hate Hulk .
THOR: Earth loves Hulk . They love you . You 're of the Avengers . One of the team , one of our friends . This is what friends do . They support each other .
HULK: You 're Banner 's friend .
THOR: I 'm not Banner 's friend . I prefe you .
HULK: Banner 's friend .
THOR: I do n't even like Banner . `` I 'm into numbers and science and stuff . ''
HULK: Thor go . Hulk Stay .
THOR: Fine . Stay here . Stupid place . It 's hideous , by the way . The red , the white . Just pick a color . Thor heads for the exit , a wide open door .
HULK: Smash you .
THOR: You did n't smash anything . I won that fight
HULK: I smashed you .
THOR: Yeah , sure , sure .
HULK: Baby Arms .
THOR: What ?
HULK: Baby .
THOR: Moron ! You big child .
HULK: Thor go !
THOR: I am going .
HULK: Thor go again ! Thor home .
THOR: That 's great . Have fun .
HEIMDALL: I see you . But you are far away .
THOR: What 's going on here ?
HEIMDALL: Come see for yourself .
THOR: You 're talking about evacuating Asgard ?
HEIMDALL: We wo n't last long if we stay .
THOR: I 'm working on it , but I do n't even eally know where the hell I am .
HEIMDALL: You 're on a planet surrounded by doorways . Go through one .
THOR: Which one ?
HEIMDALL: The big one !
HULK: Thor sad .
THOR: Shut up . Hulk HITS Thor , bullying him into opening up .
HULK: THOR SAD ! ! !
THOR: I 'm not sad , you idiot . I 'm pissed off ! Angry . I lost my father . I lost my hammer .
HULK: Whining and crying . Cry like baby .
THOR: You 're not even listening . Thor KICKS a random helmet .
HULK: Do n't kick stuff .
THOR: You 're being a really bad friend .
HULK: You bad friend !
THOR: You know what we call you ?
HULK: No .
THOR: We call you the stupid Avenger .
HULK: You 're tiny Avenger !
THOR: What , are you crazy ?
HULK: Yes .
THOR: You know what ? Earth does hate you .
HULK: No .
THOR: I 'm sorry I said those things . You 're not the stupid Avenger . Nobody calls you the stupid Avenger .
HULK: It 's okay .
THOR: You just ca n't go around throwing shields at people . Could have killed me .
HULK: I know . I 'm sorry . I just get so angry all the time . Hulk always , always angry .
THOR: I know . We 're the same , you and I . We 're just a couple of hot-headed fools .
HULK: Yeah , same . Hulk like fire , Tho like water .
THOR: We 're kind of both like fire .
HULK: But Hulk like real fire . Hulk like aging fire . Thor like smoldering fire .
THOR: Hulk , I need you to do something for me . TIME CUT Morning .
HULK: Angry girl !
VALKYRIE: What 's going on ? What do you ?
THOR: We need to talk .
VALKYRIE: No , you want to talk to me . Valkyrie turns to leave .
THOR: I need her to stay .
HULK: Stay ! Please ?
VALKYRIE: All right . Here 's the deal . I 'll listen to you till this is empty . She TIPS BACK the bottle and starts CHUGGING .
THOR: Asgard is in danger and people are dying . We need to get back there . I need your helpwow .
VALKYRIE: Finished . Bye . She has indeed finished . She goes to leave .
THOR: Odin is dead .
VALKYRIE: If Hela 's back then Asgard is already lost .
THOR: I 'm going to stop her .
VALKYRIE: Alone ?
THOR: Nope . I 'm putting together a team . It 's me , you , and the big guy .
HULK: No team . Only Hulk .
THOR: It 's me and you .
VALKYRIE: I think it 's only you .
THOR: Wait . Just listen . The Valkyrie are legend , elite warriors of Asgard . You are sworn to defend the throne .
VALKYRIE: I 'm not getting dragged into another one of Odin 's family squabbles .
THOR: What 's that supposed to mean ?
VALKYRIE: Your sister . Her power comes from Asgard , same as yours .
THOR: I agree .
VALKYRIE: Do n't get familiar .
THOR: I agree . That 's why I turned down the throne . But this is n't about the crown . This is about the people . They 're dying and they 're you 're people , too . Val SHOVES him away . Thor stumbles back .
VALKYRIE: Forget it . I have .
THOR: Okay .
VALKYRIE: Okay .
THOR: Good . Great .
VALKYRIE: Great .
THOR: Thank you .
VALKYRIE: For what ?
THOR: For this .
HULK: Friend Stay !
THOR: All right . Come on .
HULK: Friend stay !
THOR: No , no , no !
HULK: Stay !
THOR: Stop ! Stop breaking everything !
HULK: Do n't go !
THOR: Banner . Hey , hey , hey . You all ight , Banner ? Sun 's going down . Sun 's going down . That 's it , eathe . I wo n't hurt you . Sun 's going down .
BANNER: Thor ?
THOR: Yeah .
BANNER: What happened to your hair ?
THOR: Some creepy old man cut it off .
BANNER: It looks good .
THOR: Thanks .
BANNER: Where are we ? How 's Nat ?
THOR: Nat is good , I 'm sure .
BANNER: And what about Sokovia ?
THOR: Sokovia ?
BANNER: The city , Sokovia . Did we save it ?
THOR: Banner , listen .
BANNER: What ?
THOR: Sokovia . Ultron . That was two years ago .
BANNER: What are you saying ? I 've been Hulk for two years ?
THOR: I 'm afraid so .
BANNER: What the hell happened ? Banner rushes to his feet . Thor follows .
THOR: Banner , there 's something you should know Banner goes to the flight console .
BANNER: Banner .
THOR: What ?
BANNER: Ship 's log
THOR: Yeah , about that . Banner hears
BANNER: Who 's that ?
THOR: He kind of runs the place . You actually lived in his house . Back to Banner . A distant , confused stare .
BANNER: I did ?
THOR: Yeah . Quite a lot 's happened . You and I had a fight recently .
BANNER: Did I win ?
THOR: No , I won . Easily .
BANNER: Does n't sound right .
THOR: Well , it 's true .
GRANDMASTER: It seems that that criminally seductive Lord of Thunder has stolen him away .
THOR: Seductive GOD of Thunder . We need to move .
BANNER: Oh , no . This is bad . This is eally , really bad . Thor , I think I 'm freaking out .
THOR: No , no , no . Do n't freak out . You 're okay . Put these on .
BANNER: These are Tony 's clothes .
THOR: I know , come on .
BANNER: Is he here ?
THOR: No , he 's not here . But listen . Just stay calm , okay ? The sun 's going down . The sun 's getting eally low . Sun 's going down .
GRANDMASTER: I 'm upset ! I 'm very upset . You know what I like about being upset ? Blame . Right now , that 's the mindset that I 'm in . And you know who I 'm blaming ?
LOKI: Grandmaster , I-
GRANDMASTER: Hey ! Do n't interrupt me !
TOPAZ: Here you go .
GRANDMASTER: Why are you handing me the melt stick ? He was interrupting . That 's not a capital violation . My precious champion has come up missing and its all because of that Lord of Thunder . It 's all because of him . YOUR brother . Whatever the story is . Adopted , or complicated . I 'm sure there 's a big history . And YOUR contender .
LOKI: My dear friend , if you were to give me twelve hours I could bring them oth back to you .
VALKYRIE: I can do it in two .
LOKI: I could do it in one .
GRANDMASTER: You know what ? I woke up this morning thinking about a public execution . But for now , I 'll settle for this sweet little `` who 's gon na get him first ? '' So you 're on the clock .
LOKI: What have you done ! ?
VALKYRIE: I do n't answer to you , lackey .
LOKI: It 's Loki . And you will answer to the Grandmaster .
VALKYRIE: I do n't help anyone .
LOKI: You 're a Valkyrie . I thought the Valkyrie all died gruesome deaths ?
VALKYRIE: Choose your next words wisely .
LOKI: Terribly sorry . Must be a very painful memory
THOR: The sun 's going down . It 's getting eally low . The sun 's going down . It 's getting real low .
BANNER: Would you stop saying that ! ?
THOR: I just need you to stay calm .
BANNER: Calm ! ? I 'm on an alien planet !
THOR: It 's just a planet . You 've been on a planet before .
BANNER: Yeah ! One !
THOR: Now you 've been on two . That 's a good thing . It 's a new experience .
BANNER: My neurons , they 're firing faste than my brain can handle the information .
THOR: Alright , well , you 're back now , that 's all that matters .
BANNER: No , it 's not what matters . What I 'm trying to tell you , is that if I turn into the Hulk again , Banne may never come back . And we 're stranded on a planet that is designed to stress me out .
THOR: We 're not stranded , I 'm gon na figure out a way to get us home .
BANNER: Thank you .
THOR: Not your home , though . Asgard .
BANNER: What ?
THOR: Listen , my people are in great danger . You and I , we have to fight this really powerful being who also happens to be my sister .
BANNER: Okay , that is so wrong on so many I do n't wan na fight you sister . That 's a family issue .
THOR: No , she 's an evil being .
BANNER: I do n't care what she is . I 'm not fighting any more beings . I 'm sick of it . I just told you .
THOR: No , no . I 'm putting together the team . The Hulk is the fire .
BANNER: Wait , you 're just using me to get to the Hulk .
THOR: What ? No !
BANNER: It 's gross . You do n't care about me . You 're not my friend .
THOR: No ! I do n't even like the Hulk . He 's all like `` smash , smash , smash . '' I prefer you .
BANNER: Thanks .
THOR: But if I 'm being honest , when it comes to fighting evil beings , he is very powerful and useful .
BANNER: Yeah , Banner 's powerful and useful , too .
THOR: Is he though ?
BANNER: How many PhDs does Hulk have ? Zero . How many PhDs does Banne have ? Seven .
THOR: Fine , you do n't have to fight anyone . But we 're in danger here , so we have to move .
BANNER: What are you doing with that ?
THOR: I need a disguise . I 'm a fugitive .
BANNER: I need a disguise .
THOR: You are the disguise .
BANNER: I 'll be Tony Stark .
THOR: What ?
BANNER: Yeah . Tony and the gypsy .
THOR: No , no you 're not Tony . You 're Bruce Banner .
BANNER: Then why did you dress me up like Tony ?
THOR: Because you were naked .
BANNER: Okay , I 'll give you that . They stand up . Banner adjusts his crotch .
THOR: What are you doing ? Stop doing that !
BANNER: Tony wears his pants super tight !
THOR: Why are you being so weird ?
BANNER: I do n't know . Maybe the fact that I was trapped for two years inside of a monster made me a little weird . Banner flashes green . Thor calms him down .
THOR: Hey . It 's okay . You 're good . Calm down . Come on . Listen , we 're gon na go to Asgard and you 're not gon na have to think about the Hulk ever again . All right ?
BANNER: All right .
THOR: This is bad . Banner ! Banner !
VALKYRIE: Hi .
THOR: I was gon na do that .
VALKYRIE: Yeah , well , I did it first .
THOR: That 's good . What are you doing here ?
VALKYRIE: What are you doing here ? I thought you were leaving .
THOR: I got sidetracked .
VALKYRIE: What 's with the
THOR: It 's my disguise .
VALKYRIE: But I can see your face .
THOR: Not when I do this , you ca n't . Your hair looks nice . I like what you did with it . Change it ? Washed it maybe ?
BANNER: What are those things on her eyes ? Are those the people that she 's killed ? She 's so beautiful and strong
VALKYRIE: Who is this guy ?
THOR: He 's a friend .
BANNER: Who ? Me ? I 'm Bruce .
VALKYRIE: I feel like I know you .
BANNER: I feel like I know you too .
VALKYRIE: Look , I 've spent years in a haze trying to forget my past . Sakaaa seemed like the best place to drink and forget and to die one day .
THOR: I was thinking that you drink too much , and that probably was going to kill you .
VALKYRIE: I do n't plan to stop drinking , but I do n't want to forget . I ca n't turn away anymore . So , if I 'm donna to die , well it may as well be driving my sword through the heart of that murderous hag .
THOR: Good . They arrive at a door . Before they enter
VALKYRIE: Yeah . So I 'm saying that I wan na e on the team . Has it got a name ?
THOR: Yeah , it 's called the Revengers .
VALKYRIE: Revengers ?
THOR: Because I 'm getting revenge . You 're getting revenge . Do you want revenge ?
BANNER: I 'm undecided .
THOR: Okay .
VALKYRIE: Also , I 've got a peace offering .
LOKIE: Surprise .
LOKI: OW !
THOR: Just had to be sure .
LOKI: Hello , Bruce .
BANNER: So , last time I saw you , you were trying to kill everybody . Where are you at these days ?
LOKI: It varies from moment to moment .
THOR: Is that a Dragonfang ?
VALKYRIE: It is .
THOR: My God . This is the famed sword of the Valkyrie .
VALKYRIE: Sakaar and Asgard are about as fa apart as any two known systems . Our best bet is a wormhole just outside the city limits . A nice clean wormhole outside the city .
THOR: Nope . We 're going through that one .
VALKYRIE: The Devil 's Anus ?
BANNER: Wait , whose anus are we going through ?
THOR: For the record , I did n't know it was called that when I picked it .
BANNER: That looks like a collapsing neutron star inside of an Einstein- Rosen Bridge .
VALKYRIE: We need another ship . That would tear mine to pieces .
THOR: She 's right . We need one that can withstand the geodetic strain from the singularity .
BANNER: And has an offline power steering system that could also function without the on-board computer .
VALKYRIE: And we need one with cup holders , ecause we 're gon na die . So , drinks !
BANNER: Do I know you ? I feel like I know you .
VALKYRIE: I feel like I know you , too . It 's weird .
THOR: What do you say , doctor ? Uncharted metagalactic travel through a volatile cosmic gateway . Talk about an adventure .
VALKYRIE: There are one or two ships , absolute top-of-the-line models
LOKI: I do n't mean to impose , but the Grandmaster has a great many ships . I may eve have stolen the access codes to his security system .
VALKYRIE: And suddenly you 're overcome with an urge to do the right thing .
LOKI: Heavens , no . I 've run out of favo with the Grandmaster .
THOR: You 're telling us you can get us access into the garage without setting off any alarms ?
LOKI: Yes , brother . I can .
BANNER: Okay , can I just A quick FYI , I was just talking to him just a couple minutes ago and he was totally ready to kill any of us .
VALKYRIE: He did try to kill me .
THOR: Yes , me too . On many , many occasions . There was one time when we were children , he transformed himself into a snake , and he knows that I love snakes . So , I went to pick up the snake to admire it and he transformed back into himself and he was like , `` Yeah , it 's me ! '' And he stabbed me . We were eight at the time . Loki suppresses a smile .
VALKYRIE: If we 're boosting a ship , we 're gon na need to draw some guards away from the palace .
LOKI: Why not set the beast loose ?
THOR: Shut up .
VALKYRIE: You guys have a beast ?
THOR: No , there 's no beast . He 's just eing stupid . We 're going to start a revolution .
BANNER: Revolution ?
THOR: I 'll explain later .
VALKYRIE: Who 's this guy again ?
THOR: I 'll explain later .
KORG: Is that some sort of protoplasm , all the stuff that 's coming out of you ? Or are they eggs ? Looks like eggs .
VALKYRIE: I 'm looking for Korg .
KORG: Who 's asking ? I know you 're asking . Is anyone else asking , o is it just you ? Valkyrie tosses him a high-tech rifle .
VALKYRIE: The Lord of Thunder sends his best .
KORG: My revolution has begun
GRANDMASTER: Revolution ? How did this happen ?
TOPAZ: Do n't know . But the Arena 's mainframe for the Obedience Disks have been deactivated and the slaves have armed themselves .
GRANDMASTER: Oh ! I do n't like that word !
TOPAZ: Mainframe ?
GRANDMASTER: No . Why would I not like `` mainframe ? '' No , the `` S '' word .
TOPAZ: Sorry , the `` prisoners with jobs '' have armed themselves .
GRANDMASTER: Okay , that 's better .
THOR: Hey , so listen , we should talk .
LOKI: I disagree . Open communication was never our family 's forte .
THOR: You have no idea . I 've had quite the revelation since we spoke last . The door opens , revealing a bunch of guards .
LOKI: Hi !
THOR: Thought you did n't want to talk about it ?
LOKI: Here 's the thing . I 'm probably etter off staying here on Sakaar .
THOR: That 's exactly what I was thinking .
LOKI: Did you just agree with me ?
THOR: This place is perfect for you . It 's savage , chaotic , lawless . Brother , you 're going to do GREAT here .
LOKI: Do you truly think so little of me ? Thor pauses , considers his brother . Then
THOR: Loki , I thought the world of you . I thought we were gon na fight side y side forever . But , at the end of the day , you 're you , I 'm me
LOKI: It 's probably for the best that we never see one another again .
THOR: That 's what you always wanted . Beat . Then
LOKI: What ?
THOR: `` Get Help . ''
LOKI: No .
THOR: Come on , you love it .
LOKI: I hate it .
THOR: It 's great . IT works every time .
LOKI: It 's humiliating .
THOR: Do you have a better plan ?
LOKI: No .
THOR: We 're doing it .
LOKI: We are not doing `` Get Help . ''
THOR: Get help ! Please ! My brother , he 's dying .
LOKI: I still hate it . It 's humiliating .
THOR: Not for me , it 's not .
LOKI: The Commodore .
THOR: Never one for sentiment , were you ?
LOKI: Easier to let it burn .
THOR: I agree .
GRANDMASTER: Loyal Sakaarians , Lord of Thunde has stolen my ship and my favorite champion . Sakaarians , take to the skies . Bring him down . Do not let him leave this planet .
BANNER: Good shot !
VALKYRIE: I hope that you 're tougher than you look .
BANNER: Why ?
THOR: Yes , we should . Where are the guns on this ship ?
VALKYRIE: Grandmaster uses it for his good times , orgies and stuff .
BANNER: Did she just say the Grandmaste uses it for orgies ?
THOR: Yeah . Do n't touch anything . CLUNK ! CLUNK ! CLUNK ! More fire from behind .
VALKYRIE: In a minute !
THOR: I should probably go and help .
BANNER: No . I do n't know how to fly one of these .
THOR: You 're a scientist . Use one of your PhDs .
BANNER: None of them are for flying alien spaceships !
VALKYRIE: Guys , we 're coming up on the Devil 's Anus !
KORG: There she is . Our ticket out of here . Hey , what 's this ?
LOKI: Thank you .
KORG: Hey man , we 're about to jump on that ginormous spaceship . You wan na come ?
LOKI: You do seem like you 're in desperate need of leadership .
KORG: Why thank you .
VALKYRIE: Here we go !
SKURGE: Asgardians , some misguided soul has stolen the Bifrost sword . Tell us where it is , or there will be consequences . Bad ones .
HELA: You .
ASGARDIAN CITIZENS: No ! Stop !
HELA: Well ? Executioner ?
ASGARDIAN MAN: Wait ! I know where the sword is .
VALKYRIE: I never thought I 'd be back here .
BANNER: I thought it 'd be nicer . I mean , not that it 's not nice . It 's just , it 's on fire .
VALKYRIE: Here , up here in the mountains .
THOR: Okay , drop me off at the palace and I 'll draw her away .
VALKYRIE: And get yourself killed ?
THOR: The people trapped down there are all that matters . While I 'm dealing with Hela , I need you two to help get everyone off Asgard .
BANNER: How the hell are we supposed to do that ?
THOR: I have a man on the ground .
HEIMDALL: Asgard . She 's here .
THOR: Now the ship has guns .
VALKYRIE: I 'll take it from here .
THOR: I found this in the armory .
VALKYRIE: `` Your majesty . '' Do n't die . You know what I mean .
HEIMDALL: We must keep moving ! Go to the Bifrost !
THOR: Sister .
HELA: You 're still alive .
THOR: I love what you 've done with the place . Redecorating , I see .
HELA: It seems our father 's solution to every problem was to cover it up .
THOR: Or to cast it out . He told you you were worthy . He said the same thing to me .
HELA: You see , you never knew him , not at his best . Odin and I drowned entire civilizations in blood and tears . Where do you think all this gold came from ? And then one day he decided to become a benevolent king .
THOR: I understand why you 're angry . And you are my sister , and technically have a claim to the throne . And elieve me , I would love fo someone else to rule . But it ca n't e you . You 're justthe worst . Hela puts on her headdress .
HELA: Okay , get up . You 're in my seat .
THOR: You know , Father once told me that a wise king never seeks out war .
HELA: But must always be ready for it . They CHARGE each other .
HEIMDALL: Go back !
HELA: To be honest , I expected more .
SKURGE: Heimdall ! The sword ! The Butcher army CHARGES
HEIMDALL: We must cross now ! To Bi-Frost !
HELA: Here 's the difference between us . I 'm Odin 's firstborn , the rightful heir , the savior of Asgard . And you 're nothing .
VALKYRIE: This stupid dog wo n't die !
BANNER: Everything 's going to be okay . I got this . You want to know who I am ?
VALKYRIE: What the hell are you talking about ?
BANNER: You 'll see . Banner LEAPS out of the ship !
HELA: You see ? No one 's going anywhere . I 'll get that sword even if I have to kill every single one of them to do it . Thor looks down . Distraught . Heartsick .
KORG: Hey man . I 'm Korg . This is Miek . Miek steps into frame , waving .
LOKI: Your savior is here !
HELA: That little shit .
LOKI: Did you miss me ? Everybody on that ship , now .
HEIMDALL: Welcome home . I saw you coming .
LOKI: Of course you did .
HELA: A valiant effort , but you neve stood a chance .
THOR: She 's too strong . Without my hammer I can not
ODIN: Are you Thor , God of Hammers ? Thor looks up , meeting his gaze .

VALKYRIE: What 's our move ?
LOKI: I 'm not doing `` Get help . ''
THOR: Asgard 's not a place , it 's a people . This was never about stopping Ragnarokit was about causing Ragnarok . Go to the vault . Surtur 's crown . It 's the only way .

TROY: Are we shooting people , or what ?
SOLDIER #3: It looks like a grain of sand , but I do n't know how I 'm gon na get it out
VIG: Dag .
TROY: `` Gettin ' bugged drivin ' up and down the same old strip , got ta find a new place where the kids are hip , I get around ``
SOLDIER #1: I did n't think I 'd see anyone get shot over here .
VIG: It looked like the guy 's head blew three feet into the air
SOLDIER #1: Bullshit , that 's not what happened .
VIG: I said it looked like that happened , but then we got here and he was still breathing .
SOLDIER #2: Oh , my God , it 's just like 'Predator , ' where the guy , the lack guy
SOLDIER #3: Carl Weathers . His arm gets shot off .
VIG: And when it hits the ground , his hand keeps on firing .
SOLDIER #5: Take my picture .
VIG: Do you still want to sell pictures ?
TROY: For twenty .
SOLDIER #5: Twenty dollars , man , what 's the meaning of life ?
TROY: You 're lucky you got to see anybody shot in this war .
VIG: War 's been over five days , Jim , ai n't gon na be much more of this .
SOLDIER #5: Bobby , take my picture . He holds the camera out .
SOLDIER #4: If he shot the guy , it 's up to him .
SOLDIER #5: It 's not like he shot a fucking deer . It 's the enemy .
VIG: Troy 's enemy , yours for twenty . Soldiers get their cash out , Troy takes it .
TROY: Accept no substitute , this is the eal thing , oh , Jesus
VIG: What 's wrong ?
TROY: I got a really bad headache all of a sudden
VIG: No free pictures , motherfucker .
ARCHIE GATES: Is that what you got from this experience ? A goddamn watch ?
HAVICHON: Ees a great fucking watch . Close up portrait of a sheik on a Rolex .
ARCHIE GATES: There 's 700 million in gold out there and you 're fucking around with a watch ?

BILL SMITHSON: No , you 're too busy talking about the fucking gold , which by the way makes a great story if you 'd get me a goddamn lead on it
ARCHIE GATES: I think the Saddam story goes more for the jugular , journalistically speaking , I mean , he 's still here eating the shit out of his country .
BILL SMITHSON: Would you just be my guide and not my fucking producer ? You 're my guide .
ARCHIE GATES: OK , go do your celebration story , Bill .

TROY: You 're making them all hysterical .
VIG: Take your fucking rags off , take this off . No comprende English , motherfucker ?
TROY: What is your fucking problem , Conrad ?
VIG: I 'm trying to git him to obey the spirit of things but he wo n't take his rags off .
TROY: Sir ? We need you to disrobe like all the other towel heads , OK ?
VIG: Whoa , it 's a freaky thing , Troy .
TROY: There 's a document in that guy 's ass , Conrad .
VIG: That 's the freaky thing .
WALTER: Do you think he ate it ?
TROY: It would n't come out perfect like that if he ate it .
IRAQI OFFICER: Hasa man timal !
TROY: Open it up .
VIG: You only gave me one glove .
TROY: I 'm sorry I do n't have another , ut you got ta open it up . That 's how the chain of command works .
VIG: What the hell is that ?
TROY: Important enough to squeeze you cheeks for .
CATHY DAITCH: You are a trained warrior , trained warrior , trained warrior , Jesus Christ , Colonel !
ARCHIE GATES: Just the celebration story .
CATHY DAITCH: That 's it ?
ARCHIE GATES: That 's it
CATHY DAITCH: It could be another bullshit lead ut I need you to help me find a guy who might have something on the gold
ARCHIE GATES: Who 's the guy ?
CATHY DAITCH: Somebody Barlow , maybe in Company
ARCHIE GATES: Barlow .
CATHY DAITCH: Got a map out of a prisoner 's head .
ARCHIE GATES: Out of a prisoner 's head ?
CATHY DAITCH: Or his ear , or his ass , or his dick , and they got like a fifty page full-color mini atlas of Saddam 's bunkers
ARCHIE GATES: Out of a guy 's dick ?
GENERAL PYE: This is not the way we service the media , Major . Stop her
MP: You are in violation of code 37D , grinding Major Gates . They let her go . Soldiers in gas suits laugh .
ARCHIE GATES: You guys have no manners whatsoever Bill Smithson runs up , agitated .
BILL SMITHSON: I told you he was with her < /u
GENERAL PYE: We 're handling this , OK ? The MP pushes Smithson away .
BILL SMITHSON: I wanted help with the gold story , and he took off on me < /u
ARCHIE GATES: That 's a lot of bullshit .
GENERAL PYE: I give you a prestige job in the media war of the century and the guy feels neglected .
ARCHIE GATES: I 'm helping him plenty with his ig celebration feature Wheredid you get this fucking star ? < /u
GENERAL HORN: They made me a general , pal .
ARCHIE GATES: For what ? I do n't even know what we did over here , but Schwartzkopf gets a book deal , you get a star , Powell gets to be fucking president
GENERAL HORN: Are you high ? This is a huge win for us .
ARCHIE GATES: Running the press pool 's a real ig win for me .
GENERAL PYE: You want us to kill more Americans to occupy Iraq ?
ARCHIE GATES: I 'm just saying it 's ironic , that 's all .
GENERAL HORN: What the fuck is ironic ?
ARCHIE GATES: We got the biggest army in the world here but Iraq still has the d-bag dictator in power , but that 's how the world works I guess .
GENERAL PYE: Just take care of Smithson and maybe he 'll hook you up to consult on movies .
GENERAL HORN: It 's either that or be a security guard when you retire .
ARCHIE GATES: Fuck you , Ron .
GENERAL HORN: I 'm a general now , you ca n't say fuck you to me .
ARCHIE GATES: OK , sir , but there 's another thing I 'd like to say , if you do n't mind .
GENERAL HORN: Go right ahead , Colonel .
ARCHIE GATES: Fuuuuuck yooouuuu , Ronnnnn .
TROY: You 've washed your hands like a thousand times , Conrad .
VIG: Lord knows what vermin live in the utt of a dune koon .
DOC: Why do you let this cracker follow you around ?
TROY: He 's a good kid .
DOC: He 's a wall-eyed cracker .
TROY: He 's got no high school , man , he 's from a group home in Jackson
DOC: I do n't give a shit if he 's from Johannesburg . I do n't want to hea dune koon or sand nigger from him or anybody .
VIG: Captain uses those terms .
TROY: The point is , Conrad , 'towel head ' and 'camel jockey ' are perfectly good substitutes .
DOC: Exactly .
VIG: I 'm sorry , man , it 's a little confusing is all .
DOC: What can I do for your headache ? Doc Elgin opens a case full of pill bottles .
TROY: Got any Vicadan ?
DOC: All gone . How about Caffergot ?
TROY: Excellent . Let 's translate my Iraqi ass map .
DOC: We 're cool for at least three hours , but keep Walter on the door .
TROY: Would you take those fucking things off ?
WALTER: I never got to use night vision .
TROY: They do n't work during the day and stand outside the tent .
DOC: These are definitely Saddam 's unkers near Karbala .
TROY: What 's inside ?
DOC: According to Intelligence Picasso , Armani , Rolex , Mercedes , Sony you name it Kuwait was Muslim Beverly Hills and Saddam sacked it .
VIG: Man , get an awesome stereo system with like ten BOS speakers
TROY: Silver Lexus convertible .
DOC: Lexus does n't make a convertible .
TROY: Yes , they do .
DOC: Infiniti has one coming .
TROY: You 're wrong .
DOC: You ca n't get a car home from here anyway .
TROY: If I get enough Rolexes I could uy one when I got home .
VIG: One gold Rolex , I get a very fine split level outside Jackson .
TROY: My one problem , see , is the risk here
DOC: What risk ? We already did the isk . I signed up last year to ank some computer training
TROY: Tell me about it .
DOC: Next thing I know I 'm sitting here waiting to get hit by a Scud . I put my life on the line for what purpose I 'm not sure , and now the good Lord puts this map in my path
TROY: He could put a land mine in you path if we try to find this place
DOC: You 're safe with me .
TROY: Cuz you have a galactic plutonium forcefield .
DOC: I do n't talk about it . But I do have a ring of Jesus fire .
TROY: You have a ring of Jesus fire .
DOC: I was fire baptized .
VIG: I was baptized in water .
DOC: I 'm fire baptized .
TROY: I do n't even know what wate aptism means .
DOC: For those who understand , no explanation is necessary ; fo those who do n't , no explanation will suffice . You can benefit from my Jesus ring if you do right by me , you got that ?
TROY: OK .
WALTER: This tent is restricted
ARCHIE GATES: Get the fuck out of my way .
WALTER: May day , may day
ARCHIE GATES: Good afternoon . He walks up to them .
DOC: Yes , sir , I mean , no , sir .
ARCHIE GATES: Then maybe it 's the urology tent .
TROY: Captain 's at a staff meeting .
ARCHIE GATES: That 's OK , I 'm not looking for a proctologist or a urologist I 'm looking for Sargeant Barlow .
VIG: I do n't recognize you , sir . Are you in this division ?
DOC: He 's not in this division . He 's Special Forces . Troy and Vig are impressed .
ARCHIE GATES: And you would be the Three Wise Men , right , Mappy , Slappy , and Pappy
WALTER: Damn . Freeze . Do not pass . Hold it , freeze . Stop . Freeze .
VIG: His name is Walter .
ARCHIE GATES: Did you good soldiers present this map to Captain Van Meter ?
TROY: Not yet .
ARCHIE GATES: Then I 'll take it to him . Troy stands and grabs the map .
TROY: We 'll take it to him . Sir .
ARCHIE GATES: It wo n't do either of us any good then , will it ?
TROY: He 's our commander , sir . We 'd have to tell him you took it .
ARCHIE GATES: It could be nothing but a sandy love letter from one Eye-raqi to another
TROY: It 's a series of bunkers nea Karbala .
ARCHIE GATES: Maybe .
TROY: Not maybe , definitely . Recon photos match the map .
ARCHIE GATES: May I look at the goddamn map ?
VIG: Dag .
ARCHIE GATES: That 's what makes Rangers badass , we get the best flashlights .
DOC: Seventy-five klicks north .
ARCHIE GATES: More like 65 .
TROY: Much closer to Karbala .
ARCHIE GATES: Leave at dawn , back by lunch , not a big deal . Of course He turns the overhead light back on .
DOC: What gold ?
ARCHIE GATES: You do n't even know what 's inside these bunkers , do you ?
VIG: Rolexes .
ARCHIE GATES: Rolexes are swell , but I 'm talking about Kuwaiti bullion .
VIG: You mean the little cubes you put in hot water for soup ?
ARCHIE GATES: No . Not the little cubes you put in hot water for soup .
TROY: Gold bricks .
ARCHIE GATES: 5 kilos each , $ 50,000 in today 's market .
VIG: For one gold brick ?
ARCHIE GATES: I 'm sure Mr. Hussein has divided his bricks . into many different hiding places , but just one hiding place should be easy to take , and that would be enough to get us out of our day jobs . Unless the three kings are in love with their day jobs . Dolly Troy , Doc , Vig stare at Archie .
VIG: I do n't really have a day job .
TROY: What about the risk of taking a Humvee and all that
ARCHIE GATES: We do this shit all the time .
VIG: What else did you do , sir ?
ARCHIE GATES: In Panama we went sailing in Noriega 's boats .
TROY: Wow .

DOC: What about Iraqi soldiers ?
ARCHIE GATES: Let 's see . They had the shit ombed out them for two months , they 're deserting all over the place , and they 've completely surrendered to us . That 's a beaten army in every sense of the word . He looks at them .
TROY: Walter .
ARCHIE GATES: Cappy . Walter comes in .
WALTER: How am I gon na get out of the company ?
ARCHIE GATES: Your captain will be detained by a friend of mine .
VIG: Is it true you got to take an enemy ear to be Special Forces ?

DOC: Warren Moon is an excellent quarterback .
VIG: The Oilers have gone nowhere ehind Warren Moon .
DOC: Randall Cunningham .
TROY: Do n't get down in the mud with him , Doc .
VIG: The Eagles will never get to the Superbowl with him . Archie moves his hand to the Bach .

TROY: We can all agree there are manyexcellent black quarterbacks. < /u
DOC: Hit it , you sorry-assed cracker

ARCHIE GATES: Did you guys see any action at all ?
VIG: Only night bombing on CNN , except for Troy 's supercool shooting that guy in the neck
ARCHIE GATES: Is sepsis cool ?
VIG: What 's sepsis ?
DOC: Infection of the blood .
ARCHIE GATES: As in septic tank , because that 's what happens when a bullet hits you . The lead tears in there
DOC: I heard something about that
VIG: Tension pneumo what ?
ARCHIE GATES: A bullet , or a blade does n't kill you , but makes a little hole in the lung , so every time you eathe , a little air leaks into the chest cavity , which starts to fill up like a balloon . And that alloon starts to push your organs to the side , crushing your lung , your liver , your heart . Your own eathing kills you , one breath at a time kinda like a job you ca n't stand or a bad lie you once told .
DOC: That 's not fatal , they can stop it .
ARCHIE GATES: If you know how to make anothe little hole in the chest to let the air out , just like you would with an overinflated tire . They look at Archie , scared by this .
TROY: Can we play the Beach Boys when we go in ?
DOC: The goddamn Beach Boys .
TROY: I 'm not ashamed of liking the Beach Boys . It calms me down . Better than Mozart .
ARCHIE GATES: Bach .
VIG: Where 's the bunker ? < /u

VIG: We are the Army of the United States of America . We are here to protect you . Remain calm .
ARCHIE GATES: Orders from President Bush , step aside .
IRAQI MOTHER: No milk . Baby milk .

BILL SMITHSON: Fuck that . Stop the bike. < /u Walter keeps driving .
DOC: I 'm all right , I 'm cool .
ARCHIE GATES: What is the art of war , because it is not for killing people , it 's a stratagem to give life to many by killing the evil perpetrated by a few I am burning up in this goddamn suit
TROY: I do n't even know what happened ack there . Civilians were spitting on their own soldiers ; the soldiers were shooting the civilians and ignoring us
DOC: They already surrendered to us . Now they 're after Shiites .
VIG: What exactly is a Shiite ?
ARCHIE GATES: They make up the ethnic majority ut they do n't have any power . When Bush pulled us out , he told them to start a civil war to bring Saddam down , and now they 're getting wasted .
VIG: The civil war ? How could it be the civil war ?
TROY: It 's a war inside the same country , Conrad . That 's a civil war .
ARCHIE GATES: Put these on , we are now U.S. Marines .
TROY: I ca n't do this , OK ? Because I 've got a family and if I shit in a ag the rest of my life cuz I got shot after the war 's already over < /u that would be pretty fucking stupid , would n't it ?

TROY: Did you hear anything I said .
VIG: Respect is the most important .
ARCHIE GATES: Too dependent on other people .
DOC: Money .
ARCHIE GATES: Comes and goes , man .
TROY: What is this bullshit ?
DOC: What 's the most important thing ?
ARCHIE GATES: Necessity . That 's what dictates what will happen at any given time in life . Necessity says we do n't spend American lives taking out Saddam , which leaves Saddam the necessity of taking out the Shiites so he can stay in power , which leaves us to take the gold .
TROY: We could 've been shot .
ARCHIE GATES: Did you notice they did n't touchus ? We decimated their entirecountry . They 're scared shitless of us . There 's time to try anothe unker . I say we go .
DOC: Let 's do it .
VIG: Rock and roll .
TROY: OK. And I 'll be wearing fashionable kevlar . As a necessity . He pulls a vest out of the Humvee .
BILL SMITHSON: I 'm at some goddamn marsh , all we 've seen are Russian cranes .
WALTER: Pelicans .
BILL SMITHSON: I think the Saddam story goes more for the jugular , journalistically speaking , Al . Let 's grow some alls and do the Shiite uprising , for Christ 's sake . Bill Smithson closes the cell phone .
WALTER: I thought the gold was the hot spot .
BILL SMITHSON: Karbala 's the new hotspot , and I 'm driving .
WALTER: Military regulations , you can not drive .
GENERAL HORN: What the fuck are you doing ?
ARCHIE GATES: Faster. < /u
TROY: Drop your weapon. < /u
DOC: Put it down. < /u
VIG: Do n't make me smoke your ass , Abdul .

ARCHIE GATES: By order of the cease-fire signedin Safwan , March 3 , the UnitedStates Marines hereby confiscateall material stolen by Iraq fromthe Emirate of Kuwait < /u
TROY: Down. < /u The other rifle-loader stands looking scared .
ARCHIE GATES: Never hit anyone with your pistol , Doc .
DOC: Sorry about that .
IRAQI CAPTAIN: For wife .
ARCHIE GATES: I 've been divorced three times .
TROY: No , newest and best has bette noise reduction . The Iraqi looks puzzled .
ARCHIE GATES: Where 's the gold , Captain ? Tell us so we do n't have to kill you .
TROY: There 's another room over here .
IRAQI SARGEANT: I am just do my job , buddy .
ARCHIE GATES: Take us to the basement .
VIG: Do n't start this shit again .
IRAQI SARGEANT: Prisoner stay . Gabar matan .
VIG: What the fuck are you talking about ?
IRAQI SARGEANT: Kinam vanir ! Vanir ! < /u
VIG: Goddamn it everybody calm down. < /u
IRAQI CAPTAIN: It 's my ass , donkey dick , Saddam will shoot me dead .
VIG: This is the United States Military .
IRAQI CAPTAIN: It 's Saddam 's gold .
ARCHIE GATES: Listen to me we leave you alone to kill your Shiites , but everything you took from Kuwait , that belongs to us now , understand ? He turns to Doc .
DOC: Why ?
ARCHIE GATES: Stick to the plan . The plan is fo gold .
TROY: Is this five kilos ? Archie holds another brick .
ARCHIE GATES: Yeah , that 's five kilos .

ARCHIE GATES: Ten suitcases ; sixty bricks each . That 's thirty million dollars .
TROY: I 'm gon na get a fleet of Lexus convertibles in different colors .
DOC: I told you Lexus does n't make a convertible .
TROY: I 'll bet you a Lexus they do .
DOC: OK , you 're on for a Lexus , but it wo n't be a convertible .
TROY: Shit .
ARCHIE GATES: They did n't get it here in these ags .
DOC: The tensilary strength goes to 200 pounds .
TROY: The what ?
DOC: Tensilary strength , it 's what the suitcase can hold .
ARCHIE GATES: Why would you know that ?
TROY: He works at an airport .
DOC: 60 bars , 13 pounds each is like 800 pounds . The smaller Vuittons handle 65 .
ARCHIE GATES: You got any more luggage here ? The Interrogator looks at him .
TROY: What 's the shipping plan ?
ARCHIE GATES: I told you that 's handled .
TROY: How is it handled ? You have to tell us now .
DOC: Yeah , tell us now .
ARCHIE GATES: I 've got a friend , he 's in French Special Forces . He 's gon na put it in barrels filled with oil and ury it . In a few weeks , he 'll drive it to Yanbu
TROY: Where 's Yanbu ?
ARCHIE GATES: It 's a port in Saudi .
TROY: I do n't know about getting them to Baltimore , but these hat boxes ai n't gon na fit in the Humvee .
ARCHIE GATES: We need a trailer .

VIG: God help me .
ARCHIE GATES: Go. < /u
TROY: u > Where 's Conrad ? < /u

SOLDIER #4: If he shot the guy , it 's up to him .
SOLDIER #5: It 's not like he shot a fucking deer . It 's the enemy .
VIG: It 's Troy 's enemy , yours fo twenty .
ARCHIE GATES: I 've been waiting 18 years to get that right .

GENERAL HORN: Turn that damn camera off. < /u
BILL SMITHSON: That 's a 75 thousand dolla camera
GENERAL HORN: What the fuck are they doing here ?
SARGEANT: I thought they were authorized
GENERAL HORN: They are not fucking authorized , for Christ 's sake MPs take the tapes from the cameras .
CATHY DAITCH: I 'm gon na get that tape back .
GENERAL HORN: You are under arrest . You are going to be court-martialed . And you will show us where the bullion is right now .
SOLDIER #10: Yeah. < /u
PRESIDENT BUSH: This act of naked aggression must be checked . The United States , along with coalition forces from the Middle East , have drawn a line in the sand . There is only one way for this situation to be satisfactorily resolved . The belligerent forces from the Republic of Iraq must be emoved from Kuwait , be it by choice , o y force
JAEGER: At-at-at-at-at . At-at-at-at-at .
EPPS: What are you doing ?
JAEGER: What does it look like I 'm doing ? I 'm killing Iraqis . At-at-at-at-at . At-at- at-at
WES: Could you stop , please . You 're giving me a headache .
JAEGER: A headache ?
WES: Yeah , a headache . My head hurts . You 're making me uncomfortable .
JAEGER: I 'm making you uncomfortable . Baking away in a desert in the middle of nowhere facing three-hundred-thousand screaming Iraqis with nerve gas scud missiles , that does n't bother you . But me making a little noise is driving you out of you skull .
WES: Yes . Yes . That 's exactly it . Yes .
JAEGER: Okay . Jaeger goes right back to playing soldier .
JAEGER CONT: At-at-at-at-at .
EPPS: Knock it off !
JAEGER: Do n't get pissed at me , just 'cause I want to be ready when this war starts .
EPPS: Ready for what ? What are you supposed to e doing ?
JAEGER: I told you , I 'm shooting Iraqis .
EPPS: No you 're not .
EPPS CONT: The Iraqis are that way . Those are ou troops you 're shooting at .
JAEGER: Blow me .
EPPS: Another month in this desert and I might just .
WES: Think we 're going to do it ? Think we 're going to war ?
EPPS: Not up to us . Up to the Iraqis . All they have to do is get out of Kuwait .
JAEGER: We ought to kick their asses anyway . Even if they do get out of Kuwait we ought to kick their asses .
WES: I do n't think we 'll go to war . We should n't even be here . This is n't ou fight , it 's a regional conflict . It should be decided regionally .
JAEGER: People are suffering .
WES: People were suffering in Afganistan , and we did n't do anything .
EPPS: That 's 'cause the Afganis were n't smart enough to be sitting on top of oil . People suffering is one thing , but when the Yuppies are n't going to have enough gas for their BMWs it 's time to break out the tanks . Come on . Pack up . We 've got a whole lot of nothing to patrol .
JAEGER: We ought to kick their asses . Either way we ought to .
WES: And it 's very important when you sit down never to point the soles of you shoes at anyone . It 's considered offensive .
EPPS: You know so much about the Middle East , you know where we can get something to eat .
JAEGER: When do you ever point the soles of you feet at people ?
WES: I 'm saying do n't do it accidently .
JAEGER: Oh yeah . Accidently .
JAEGER CONT: I 'm sorry . My foot accidently jumped up in the air where you could see the bottom of it . I hate it when that happens .
WES: Come on . You 're going to get us in trouble .
JAEGER: It was an accident . You saw it was an accident .
WES: I 'm just trying to help you guys out . It does n't hurt to know something about Saudi Arabia .
EPPS: Like learning Arabic ? You 're gon na learn Arabic you might as well learn were we can get something to eat around here .
WES: I did n't learn Arabic because we were getting shipped here . You do n't learn it in a couple of weeks . I studied it in high school .
JAEGER: Spanish was n't hard enough ?
WES: I thought it would be good to know .
JAGER: Yeah , if you ever need to buy a rug .
WES: Hey , Jaeger . Why do n't you try this i > Ashra Ka mahari dahra sahib. < /i
JAEGER: What does that mean ?
WES: Do n't shoot me , I 'm friendly . You can use that when you surrender .
JAEGER: How do you say `` Come here , baby . I 'm horny . '' I can use that now .
WES: Do n't even try it . You offend a woman out here you 're in serious trouble .
EPPS: Do n't worry about Jaeger . He uses his personality as a form of birth control .
JAEGER: Blow me . Have I said that to you guys ecently ? Blow me .
JAEGER CONT: What is this ?
WES: Now you need me .
JAEGER: What is it ? You know so much about Arabland tell me what it is . Wes looks over the box carefully .
WES: Well , based on my knowledge of the egion , its culture and her people I would have to say it 's a box .
EPPS: Can you eat it ? If you ca n't eat it I eally do n't care what it is .
JAEGER: Ask him what it is .
WES: He says it 's a box .
JAEGER: Yeah , you 're funny .
WES: It 's a puzzle box . If you can figure out how to open it there 's supposed to be a treasure inside .
JAEGER: For real ? A treasure ?
EPPS: Oh , man , you 're not going to fall fo that .
JAEGER: There might be something in there .
EPPS: Yeah , the deed to the Brooklyn bridge .
JAEGER: There might be .
WES: And you 're the guy who 's going to open it .
JAEGER: I could .
EPPS: You could turn on a light if someone put your hand on the switch .
EPPS CONT: Well , that showed me . Now , can we eat ?
WES: You get it yet ?
JAEGER: Naw , nothing .
WES: You will . You 'll get it .
JAEGER: I 'll show Epps . He 'll be sorry when I get this thing open .
WES: You really think there 's a treasure inside ?
JAEGER: I do n't care if there 's a lump of coal in here . I just want to be able to ru Epps ' face in it when I crack this thing . Wes watches Jaeger work the box for a beat .
WES: Jaeger ?
JAEGER: What ?
WES: You know the fifteenth is the deadline for the Iraqis to get out of Kuwait .
JAEGER: Yeah . So ?
WES: That 's in two days .
JAEGER: Like I said ; so ?
WES: They 're cancelling all leaves , all passes . No more drills . We stand at full ready starting
JAEGER: What 's your point , Wes ? You have a point ?
WES: We 're going to war , are n't we . If they 're doing all that it must mean we 're going to war .
JAEGER: It does n't mean anything .
WES: Why would they do all that if we were n't ?
JAEGER: Okay , so we 're going to war . We 're supposed to go to war . We 're soldiers , that 's what we do . The guns , the tanks , the planes ; you 're just now getting the hint we 're in the war business ?
WES: Jaeger ?
JAEGER: What ! ?
WES: You ever think about dying ?
JAEGER: Come on , man . I almost had this thing open .
WES: You ever think about it ? You ever worry ?
JAEGER: The only thing I worry about is how much Iraqi ass I 'm going to be able to kick efore this whole thing is over . The only people who I 've got anything to worry about are the poor , dumb camel jockeys who do n't know enough to get out of the way when I come rolling at them ; an M-16 in each hand , and a grenade between my teeth . Now if you 'll excuse me , soldier , I 'd like to get back to my box . I 've got a treasure to find .
BUSH: Just two hours ago , Allied air forces egan an attack on military targets in Iraq and Kuwait . These attacks continue as I speakOur objectives are clear . Saddam Hussein 's forces will leave Kuwait . The legitimate government of Kuwait will be restored to its rightful place , and Kuwait will once again be free .
JAEGER: At-at-at-at-at .
WES: This is so weird . It 's happening , but it 's not . It 's like a TV show , and we 're part of it .
JAEGER: At-at-at-at-at .
EPPS: Will you knock it off ! Damn , man . You 're going to annoy the Iraqis into submission .
JAEGER: This is stupid . It 's going on a month now . How long are they going to let the Air Force piss on those bastards ? They can bomb them all they want , Saddam ai n't going anywhere without a ground assault . What the hell is the army waiting for ?
EPPS: Why you in such a hurry to get to shooting ?
JAEGER: I 've got to have something to tell people when I get home besides I protected a stretch of dirt that nobody wanted fo nothing in the first place .
WES: The longer the air force hits the Iraqis , the safer it'II be for us when we have to engage .
JAEGER: You know what , Wes ? If you get a note from your mommy they might excuse you from the war .
EPPS: You all want to lay off ? God . I hope the Iraqis shoot me ; put me out of my misery .
JAEGER: OH MY GOD !
EPPS: What ! ? What ! ?
JAEGER: I did it ! I got the box open .
EPPS: You almost got yourself shot , that 's what you did . Wes excitedly goes over to Jaeger .
WES: What 's inside ?
JAEGER: It'sit'sI do n't know what it is .
WES: It 's a container . Break the seal .
EPPS: Go on , man .
WES: Paper .
EPPS: It 's a fortune box . Jaeger unrolls it .
WES: What 's it say ?
EPPS: Help , I 'm being held prisoner in a puzzle ox factory .
JAEGER: It 's a drawing , or something . Some kind of art .
EPPS: Looks like something a kid would do . Wes takes the paper and looks it over .
WES: It 's a map , I think that 's what it is .
EPPS: There you go , Jaeger . Just find the uried treasure , and you 're a millionaire .
JAEGER: You think ?
EPPS: Yeah , that 's exactly what I think . You and the five thousand other suckers who ought those boxes . Let 's get out of here . We got sand to protect .
JAEGER: Woods .
WOODS: Hey , Jaeger . What 's up .
JAEGER: I 'm looking for a favor . I need a map of Iraqi .
WOODS: A map ? All I got is maps . I 'm gon na have Delayed Map Syndrome when I finally get out of here . What kind of map you need ? Topographical , geographical , thermal ?
JAGER: I do n't know . A map map .
WOODS: A map map . Woods pulls out a map and hands it to Jaeger .
WOODS CONT: That should n't be too hard to read . Iraq is the pink thing .
JAEGER: I could use some recon photos too . Woods gives Jaeger a sideways glance .
JAEGER: Justwant to be ready when we do .
WOODS: Ready for what ? Sight-seeing ?
JAEGER: The photos . Woods starts to dig for photos .
JAEGER CONT: Some good ones .
WOODS: They 're all good ones . Satellites we 've got can snap a shot of the boil on Saddam 's ass .
JAEGER: Saddam 's got a boil on his ass ?
JAEGER CONT: I do n't know .
WOODS: Yeah . You figure out how to win the wa e sure to let us know .
SOLDIER: Come on , Jaeger . We 're playing ball .
BUSH: This evening , as I report to you , the military operation known as Desert Storm enters its final phase . The coalition forces that face the tyranny of Saddam Hussein have launched an all out ground offensiveas this last , and most critical part of the campaign begins I ask for your prayers that God may bless each and every one of the coalition forces at our side in the Gulf , and that He may continue to bless our nation , the United States of America .
JAEGER: They finally start the ground war , and where are we ? Same place we 've been since we got here . Securing freedom fo the dirt .
EPPS: Everybody 's got a job to do . Figure it this way At least you get to go home alive .
JAEGER: I 'd like to go home alive with a couple of Iraqi scalps hanging from my belt .
WES: Hey , look at this !
WES{CONT: They 're surrendering to a news crew . You elieve that ? Jaeger tosses his hands in the air in defeat .
JAEGER: That 's it . It 's over . Eighteen hours into the war and it 's over .
WES: Those soldiers have got loafers on . What kind of army gives their soldiers loafers ?
EPPS: A casual one .
WES: Damn , this is sweet . We are going to be home in no time .
EPPS: Better grab up some sand to take home to your family .
JAEGER: Wewe could go home with something else .
WES: What ?
JAEGER: Withwith millions . Millions of dollars .
EPPS: What are you talking about ?
EPPS CONT: Do n't even . You 're not going to show me that tired map .
JAEGER: Wait . Wait .
EPPS: I think you 've got some issues to deal with . Really , when we get out of here I 'm pretty sure it 's shrink time for you .
JAEGER: Just listen to me ! I 've been doing some eading . In the Sixteenth century this egion was invaded by the Turks . It ecame part of the Ottoman empire . When the Turks rolled in they raped , they pillaged , the usual stuff . Anybody who had anything wanted to hide it from these astards . They buried their treasures , drew maps , and hid the maps in puzzle oxes . I read about this , man . I read about it .
EPPS: Wellllll , if you read it it must be true . Was it in the Star , or the Enquirer ?
JAEGER: Christ ! Wes , tell him . You know this stuff .
WES: The Turks invaded , yeah . I guess people would have hidden what they had . But that does n't mean what was in that box is
JAEGER: Looks at this ! Look at it ! The drawing is a map of this area right here . You can see it . The geography , the landmarks . It 's the same area . Epps grabs the map from Jaeger .
EPPS: And you know what that area is ? It 's Iraq . IRAQ ! We 're doing a little thing with them right now ; Desert Storm . Maybe you 've read about it .
JAEGER: What we 're doing is kicking ass . Fo God 's sake they got Iraqis surrendering to news crews . The war is over . We 've just got to keep shooting people 'cause the army spent all this money , and we 've got to put on a show for the taxpayers .
WES: You 're not saying what I think you 're saying . I ca n't believe you 're even thinking it .
JAEGER: It 's right here . This region ; an-Nagaf . I got recon photos . There 're no troops there , no fighting
WES: You do n't know where the Iraqis have moved to . And our forces have n't even engaged the Republican Guard yet , we do n't know
JAEGER: It 's about a hundred miles from where we are now . How long do you think it would take us to
WES: It 's not a hundred miles . It 's a hundred miles through three different kinds of terrain Pure desert , mountains , a iver . If the map is even real .
JAEGER: It 's real . I 'm telling you , it 's real .
WES: So you just want to cross into hostile territory in the middle of a war on a wild goose chase ? It 's crazy . Tell him it 's crazy , Epps .
WES CONT: Epps , tell him .
WES: You 're out of your minds , you know that ? Both of you . You do n't even know if there 's anything out there . What the hell are you thinking ?
EPPS: I 'm thinking about when this war is over . Why you figure I 'm here ? 'Cause I got tired of being president of GM ? If a other does n't play ball , or deal drugs there are n't too many big money prospects around , and I 'm not particularly interested in spending the rest of my life fighting the oil companies ' wars . So I say if maybe there 's something out there , what the hell , that 's what I say .
WES: It 's desertion .
JAEGER: Deserting what ? What the hell are we deserting ?
EPPS: It 's war . People get lost all the time in war , cut off
JAEGER: We disappear for awhile . We disappear , we came back ; nobody knows nothing .
EPPS: But we all got to be in for this . We all go , or we do nothing .
WES: Epps , you 're smarter than this . Jaeger I understand , but you 're smarter .
JAEGER: You know it 's real . You know it 's real , and you know it 's there . You know it .
WES: You 're insane if you think you 'll find anything , and sure insane if you think you can get us there and back alive .
EPPS: If you say that , then I say you do n't know Second Lieutenant Epps very well , do you ?
WES: God ! I do n't believe I 'm doing this . I do n't .
JAEGER: Yes !
EPPS: It 's going to be cool , Wes . It 's all all ight .
JAEGER: We go , we get rich , we go home . It 's that easy .
WES: Yeah . That easy .
EPPS: Now this is war .
JAEGER: Roger that .
WES: We 're going to get court martialed , you know that .
JAEGER: Hell , we 'll just buy our way out .
EPPS: Hand me the navicom .
EPPS CONT: Hold on boys and girlshold on Epps watches the navicomwatches it
WES: Oh , God .
JAEGER: You 're such a pussy , you know that ? How 'd you get in the army ?
EPPS: Cool it , Jaeger . Hey , Wes ? Wes ?
WES: What ?
EPPS: I know you think this is crazy , but a couple of hours from now you 're going to e one rich dude trying to buy up every other puzzle box out there .
WES: I 'd settle for being alive . Really . Alive would be fine .
JAEGER: Epps , is that a sand dune .
WES: Oh , no .
EPPS: Why , yes , Jaeger . I believe it is .
WES: No , please , not again .
WES VO: Nooooooooo !
JAEGER: Hey , Wes , what kind of treasure you figure these people buried ?
WES: If ! If there 's a treasure .
JAEGER: Yeah . If . Whatever . What kind you figure it is ?
WES: I do n't know . It would be small , easy to transport and hide . Gold or jewels . Probably gold .
JAEGER: Yeah ! Gold ! How much ?
WES: How the hell should I know how much ?
EPPS: But that 's the great thing about Gold . A little goes a long way .
JAEGER: You know what I 'm doing with my part of the gold ?
WES: If there 's gold . If !
JAEGER: You know what I 'm doing with my half ?
EPPS: Third . What you 're going to do with you third .
JAEGER: Yeah . I meant You know what I 'm going to do with it ? I 'm going to buy a Sixty- three 'Vette Stingray . All tricked out and cherry . I 'm going to be so sweet .
EPPS: A car ? You 're going to buy a car ?
WES: This is too much . You do n't even have the money and you 're wasting it .
JAEGER: A car is not just a car where I come from . I had this friend , had this wicked candy apple red Sixty-four and a half Mustang
EPPS: You 're getting gold , and you 're going to low it on wheels ?
EPPS: Invest it .
JAEGER: Oh , that 's fun .
EPPS: It 's not about being fun . It 's about eing smart . You take that money , you take care of it , let it grow , and you do n't ever have to do anything again . Ever . That 's freedom . That 's what I 'm talking about .
JAEGER: And I 'm talking about enjoying myself .
EPPS: You know , you sound just like a boy who 's never
WES: What 's that ?
EPPS: Take the binoculars .
JAEGER: Wh-what do you think
JAEGER: Iraqis .
WES: Oh , God !
JAEGER: Two vehicles . They 're not supposed to be here .
WES: Oh , Jesus !
JAEGER: They 're notI had the pictures . They 're not supposed to be here !
EPPS: Shut up ! Both of you shut the hell up !
JAEGER: We 've got to do something . We 've got to turn around .
EPPS: We can see them , they can see us . We un , they chase .
WES: What are we going to do ?
WES CONT: What are we going to do ! ?
EPPS: We 're going to keep driving .
JAEGER: They 'll shoot us !
EPPS: We run they 'll shoot us anyway . If we keep driving they might think we friendlies ; Iraqis . Or even if they know we 're Americans they might get scared , think we 're part of a detachment and keep on going .
JAEGER: They 're not going to
EPPS: It 's the only way . We drive !
JAEGER: Yeah ! Yeah !
WES: I think I 'm going to throw up . I am . I 'm going to toss .
JAEGER: You see that ? Right by us . They went ight by . You had them Epps ; you called it .
EPPS: Figure they do n't want to mess with us anymore than we want to mess with them .
JAEGER: Look at you , not even breaking a sweat . You 're cool , boy . You 're cool .
WES: They stopped .
EPPS: Wha
WES: Oh , Jesus , they 've stopped . Epps and Jaeger look behind them .
WES CONT: They stopped , and they 've turned around .
JAEGER: Go , go , go !
EPPS: Shoot them !
EPPS CONT: Shoot 'em !
JAEGER: Steady it out !
EPPS: I steady it out , they blow us out of the sand !
JAEGER: I got him ! You see that , I nailed him !
EPPS: Damn it !
EPPS CONT: Wes , take the wheel .
WES: Shootshoot ! Waiting Closer
JAEGER: Yeah , well , we 're not .
WES: We got to get out of here .
WES CONT: We have to go back .
JAEGER: We 're not going anywhere . Not 'til we get what we came for .
WES: We just about got killed . You know what happened ? We just about got killed , and you want to go on ?
EPPS: Jaeger , go check out the Hummer fo damage .
WES: You 're crazy , you know that ? You 're insane !
WES CONT: You know that , right ? You know he 's sick ?
EPPS: They should n't have been here .
WES: We should n't have been here , Epps . There is a war going on !
EPPS: This is miles from the battle lines . They were probably deserters .
WES: Deserters would have run , they would n't have engaged .
EPPS: They should n't have been out this way , that 's all I 'm saying .
WES: We 're not going back , are we ?
WES CONT: You bastard ! You 're trying to get us killed .
EPPS: I 'm trying to get us paid . I 'm trying to get us all paid ! As long as there 's a chance something is out there we go on . There 's not going to be anymore trouble . If there is , we go back , but there wo n't e .
EPPS CONT: You 'll feel different after we find the treasure . Money has away of making people feel different .
EPPS: She okay ?
JAEGER: Yeah . Yeah , she 's fine .
EPPS: Let 's go .
EPPS: What ?
JAEGER: I 'm just thinking , you know , if the rest of the boys knew what we 're doing . I mean if they knew what we were coming ack with .
EPPS: You ca n't tell anybody about this .
JAEGER: I know . I know . But I 'm saying , if they knew . We 're going to be millionaires , man . Millionaires ! Epps joins in cackling like a Hyena .
EPPS: It 'd make their heads explode .
JAEGER: Millionaires , man . He turns back to Wes .
JAEGER CONT}: You know we 're going to be rich . Admit it . You know . Come on , admit it . In spite of himself Wes gives a little smile .
JAEGER CONT: Ahh , there it is . There it is . You know it . Singing to Levert
EPPS: Money , money , money , moneyMONEY . Jaeger joins in .
WES: What are you doing .
EPPS: Low on gas . Got to refill .
JAEGER: I know .
EPPS: And you missed this ? How are you going to miss something like this ?
JAEGER: I did n't miss it . I figured if you knew one of the reserves got hit you 'd want to turn back .
WES: So , you just let us drive on knowing we were losing fuel ? Knowing we were going to run low in the middle of nowhere ?
JAEGER: I figuredI figured you 'd turn back . Wes gets a slow boil on .
WES: You stupid son of a bitch .
EPPS: Get off him .
EPPS CONT: You two fighting 's not going to get us anything .
WES: Him getting us stranded out here does n't do much good either .
JAEGER: We 're not stranded . We 've got enough gas in the other reserve to get us back .
WES: Then lets go back while we still can .
JAEGER: As soon as we hit the mountain we would have had to go on foot anyway . We 're not that far . We can make it .
EPPS: What do we do with the Humvee ?
JAEGER: We leave it .
WES: What if someone takes it ?
JAEGER: Who ? Who 's going to take it . We mark the location with the navicom , we can come right back to this spot . Wes has had enough .
WES: You two do n't even know how crazy you are . You want to go on your sick , little treasure hunt then go ahead , but mark me absent .
JAEGER: You have to go with us , Wes .
JAEGER: You have to go with us . You ca n't walk ack
JAEGER{CONT: And you sure as hell are n't going to drive .
EPPS: Load what you can ; water , tools , weapons . Anything you think we might need .
JAEGER: Who 's he kidding ? He wants it as bad as we do . We 're going to be fat , Epps . As soon as we get back to Saudivillie you and me are going to
EPPS: We 're going to keep going 'cause I want some of whatever 's out there . But you ever pull something like trying to get my ass stranded out here again , and I 'll kill you myself . You got that ? Jaeger just stands there , his fear swelling .
EPPS CONT: SAY IT !
JAEGER: I got thatsir .
EPPS: Faster we get there , faster we get back .
JAEGER: Yeah . I know . I 'm with you . Jaeger struggles on just a bit more , then
JAEGER CONT: I 'm gonnaI 'm just gon na stop for a little water .
EPPS: Do n't drink up all of yours , 'cause you are n't getting any of ours .
JAEGER: I 'm just going to have a little sip , that 's all . Just a sip .
JAGER{CONT: Wait for me !
EPPS: You can catch up .
JAEGER: YeahI 'm right behind you .
WES: Thanks for straightening out Jaeger .
EPPS: Maybe we are crazy for doing this . But if we do it , we do it right . I just needed to explain that in a way I would n't have to do it again .
WES: Not much chance of that . Jaeger 's an idiot .
EPPS: He 's not so
WES: He 's an idiot , and he 's not nearly as hard as he thinks .
EPPS: How tough you have to be to make the army ? All you 've got to do is shoot a gun , and stop a bullet .
WES: Look at him . We ought to just leave him ehind .
WES CONT: Like he said People get lost in wars all the time . And out here ? Out here there are eight million ways to die .
EPPS: Okay , so he was riding you . Get over it . Wes smiles a little smile .
WES: I 'm just talking . They walk on .
JAEGER: Ca n't even slow up for me . Was n't for me they would n't even be here . I 'm the one that found the map . Should have just come by myself . Should 've . Should n't even cut them in . Should n't .
JAEGER CONT: Epps !
EPPS: What ! ?
JAEGER: Mine . Epps is n't sure of what he 's heard .
EPPS: What ?
JAEGER: Mine . Land mine !
JAEGER CONT: I stepped on a land mine !
EPPS: You did n't step on any mine .
JAEGER: I heard it click .
EPPS: If you stepped on a mine you 'd be dead by now . Nobody uses delayed-fuse mines anymore .
JAEGER: I heard it .
WES: Maybe it 's just a can , or something . Jaeger loses it .
EPPS: Paranoid , that 's your problem . You 're just paranoid . Why 'd the paranoid one have to find the map ?
JAEGER: Oh , God ! Oh God !
EPPS: Just be cool .
JAEGER: It 's a mine , is n't it ?
EPPS: Just relax .
JAEGER: How 'm I gon na relax standing on a mine ! ?
EPPS: We 're going to get off , all right . We 'll get you off of there . Justbe cool .
JAEGER: Where you going ?
EPPS: Me and Wes are just going to talk .
JAEGER: Why you got to move away to talk ! ?
EPPS: We 're going to be right over here .
JAEGER: You 're moving away because it 's going to low up , is n't it ! ? It 's going to blow up !
EPPS: I said be cool , all right ? Now be cool ! Epps and Wes move over and huddle .
WES: What kind of mine ?
EPPS: I do n't know , and I was n't about to mess with it .
WES: Should have blown already . Delayed fuse , that 's Vietnam stuff .
EPPS: Maybe that 's all the Iraqis could afford , okay ? Maybe they got it on discount . Maybe the fuse is messed up . Or maybe it 's going to go off in two seconds , and we wo n't have to worry about getting Jaeger down off there , all we 'll have to worry about is finding the pieces . Behind them , pathetically , Jaeger cries
JAEGER: Epps
WES: Does n't matter . We 're not going to be able to get him off it anyway .
EPPS: There 's a way .
JAEGER: Epps
WES: Ca n't do it . Ca n't do it , and keep him alive .
EPPS: I said nobody dies . Nobody dies .
JAEGER: Epps , my leg is falling asleep . Epps thinks , and thinks hard .
EPPS: We 've got rope ?
WES: For climbing .
EPPS: Break it out . Epps crosses back over to Jaeger .
JAEGER: My leg is falling asleep .
EPPS: It 's not falling asleep . You 've only een standing there for three minutes .
JAEGER: I 'm the one who can feel my leg , and it 's falling asleep .
EPPS: It falls asleep and you die , so wake it the hell up .
JAEGER: How 's this going to work ?
EPPS: Me and Wes each going take an end of the ope , run our asses of , and yank you off the mine .
JAEGER: That 's going to do it , right ? I 'm going to be okay . Not too convincingly
EPPS: You 're going to be fine .
JAEGER: You 're not going to let me die , are you ! ? Do n't let me die ! Ignoring the question
EPPS: When we start running suck up you eath . You 're going to get the wind knocked out of you .
JAEGER: Do n't let me die , Epps . I do n't want to die .
WES: What if it 's a Valloro 69 ? Just going to ounce right up out of the ground , explode in the air , kill him and us .
EPPS: You just go when I say go .
WES: Should have at least gotten the map off of him . Blows up with him then we did all this for nothing . Ignoring him
EPPS: Ready ?
WES: Yeah .
EPPS: GO !
JAEGER: Oh , God . Oh , God !
WES: The map okay ?
JAEGER: Until we 're out of the mine field is how long .
JAEGER: That do n't mean nothing . Iraqis could have just spread them out like that ; make us think we 're in the clear .
WES: You want to crawl , crawl .
JAEGER: You 're going to blow yourselves up .
EPPS: Wes is right . If there were any more mines we would have found them . Hell , that one you stepped on was probably old anyway ; left over from the war with Iran .
JAEGER: You do n't know that . It could be a trick .
EPPS: If we step on a mine we 'll know it was . Let me see the maps . Jaeger stays down , afraid to get up .
EPPS CONT: Get up and give me the maps .
EPPS: This . Whatever it is .
JAEGER: It 's the treasure , that 's what it is .
WES: It better be .
JAEGER: The map .
JAEGER CONT: The map .
EPPS: You 're not losing trust , are you ?
JAEGER: Just figure it 's my map , I ought to hang on to it .
WES: If all we wanted was the map out of you we could have taken it while you were standing on that mine pissing on yourself .
JAEGER: Probably would 've too if Epps was n't around to stop you .
EPPS: I did n't have to stop anything , 'cause nobody was going to do nothing . We 're in this together , understand ?
JAEGER: Yeah , I understand . Wes does n't want to come along in the first place , but he gets a third of the find . That 's a sweet deal .
WES: I 'm getting tired of you riding me , Jaeger .
JAEGER: Anytime you want to do something about it just let Epps stops dead in his tracks .
EPPS: Quiet !
JAEGER: I do n't hear any
EPPS: Shut up and listen !
WES: Gunfire .
EPPS: Do n't !
JAEGER: It 's a fire fight .
EPPS: Single shots does n't mean a fire fight . That 's not a battle going on .
WES: What is it ? Epps thinks . Yeah , what the hell is it ?
JAEGER: What is it ?
EPPS: Iraqis . A bunch of them .
JAEGER: What are they doing here ? Jaeger hands the binoculars to Wes .
EPPS: Well , it 's Iraq . I 'm not sure , but I 'm guessing that has something to do with them being here .
JAEGER: What are they doing in the middle of nowhere ?
WES: Maybe they 're looking for gold .
JAEGER: Jesus ! What the hell did he do that for ? They 're Iraqis . Why are Iraqis killing Iraqis ?
WES: Those people down there are Shi'ites . You 've got Shi'ites in the south of Iraq and Khurds in the North . Neither of them 've got much love for Saddam . Probably figured once the war started there might be an uprising , so he sent his soldiers out to slap them around some .
EPPS: They 're doing more than slapping .
JAEGER: The Shi'ites are on our side ? I did n't know that .
WES: Is there anything you do know ?
JAEGER: I know you 're a pussy . I know that .
EPPS: All right . Let 's get out of here .
WES: The soldiers are going to kill those people !
JAEGER: So ?
WES: We have to do something .
EPPS: There 's nothing we can do .
WES: We can fight . That 's what we 're here for To fight the Iraqis . To help the Shi'ites , and the Khurds .
JAGER: I did n't sign up to help any Shi'ites . All we were supposed to do is get the Iraqis out of Kuwait , and if we are n't doing that then all bets are off .
EPPS: We carrying any ordinance ?
WES: Some extra grenades . A Claymore . Epps thinks , then shakes his head .
EPPS: Not enough . We 're out numbered and out gunned . They 'd cut us to shreds .
JAEGER: So good bye , Shi'ites . Thanks fo playing . We have some lovely parting gifts for you as you go .
WES: We 're American soldiers . We do n't abandon people .
JAEGER: Funny you should say that while we 're out looking for gold .
WES: You 're the one wanted to kill Iraqis so ad .
JAEGER: I 've got a new agenda now , it 's get rich . The only way the Iraqis figure into that is not at all .
EPPS: I do n't want to see people killed any more than you . But we try to help out we die , and all we do is die .
WES: We ca n't just go off and
EPPS: There 's nothing we can do . We should n't even be here in the first place .
JAEGER: This is it . We 're right on target .
EPPS: All we 've got to do is make it to the top .
WES: And find the treasure , and get it , and get back to the Humvee , and get the hell out of Iraqi without getting our heads lown off , but that 's about it .
EPPS: We 're not going to find anything standing here . Let 's get to climbing .
WES: Probably was a couple of hundred years ago when whoever drew the map came through here . Worn down to nothing now .
EPPS: Picks up again just on the other side .
JAEGER: Think we can make it ?
WES: We make it , or we go back empty handed .
EPPS: Looks like we make it .
WES: The US Army Always an adventure .
EPPS: Let me see the map .
EPPS CONT: Should be easy going from here . Stay on the pass straight to the dot .
WES: What do you figure it to be ?
EPPS: Got to be some kind of landmark ; something distinctive .
JAEGER: X marks the spot .
EPPS: Something like that .
JAEGER: But the white dot in the middle ; that 's got to mean something .
EPPS: I hope it means something , otherwise
WES: Otherwise whatever we 're looking fo could be anywhere .
EPPS: Basically . But the map has been pretty precise so far . I do n't think it 'll be too hard to
EPPS CONT: Take cover !
WES: Where 'd they go ?
EPPS: I do n't know . There 's a lot of space up here . They could be just about
WES: Weird they did n't chase us .
JAEGER: Maybe they 're as scared of us as we are of them .
WES: Just seems weird they did n't chase us .
EPPS: What 's weird is how they disappeared . Does n't make sense . Does n't
EPPS CONT: Scatter !
JAEGER: Where is it ? Where 'd it go ?
EPPS: Stay low .
JAEGER: Where the hell is it ! ?
EPPS: Just stay down .
JAEGER: What are we going to do ? What the hell are we going to do ?
EPPS: We 're not going to do anything .
JAEGER: They 're going to kill us !
EPPS: They ca n't shoot us in here .
WES: And they ca n't fly around out there forever .
EPPS: So we wait .
JAEGER: If they land
EPPS: If they land , we can take them . If they do n't land , then we 've got nothing to worry about .
WES: Missile !
EPPS: Move !
JAEGER: Epps !
WES: They want us to surrender .
EPPS: Yeah , I 'll surrender .
EPPS CONT: Get down !
JAEGER: Oh , God
WES: Yeah . Just keeps getting better and etter , does n't it ?
WES: What do you think ?
JAEGER: Lines up with the map and the photos .
EPPS: We 're right where we should be .
EPPS CONT: I sure do n't see much place else around here to hide anything .
WES: Ca n't see anything .
WES CONT: It 's got a bottom .
JAEGER: Guess we know what the next stop is .
EPPS: All right . Let 's break out some utility shovels , lanterns , and a claymore in case we have to do any blasting . Me and Jaeger 'll climb down , and see what we can see .
WES: What am I supposed to do ?
EPPS: Got to have someone here in case we need help making it back up . Does n't hurt to have a look out either .
JAEGER: Think there might be more Iraqis ?
EPPS: Right now I would n't be surprised if Eartha Kitt showed up singing Send In The Clowns .
WES: You down ?
JAEGER: Yeah , we 're down .
WES: What do you see ?
EPPS: Nothing . More to himself
EPPS CONT: A whole lot of nothing .
JAEGER: So where do we start ? Epps takes a look around , then shrugs .
EPPS: Wherever you want .
WES: HeyHey ! Sun 's going down . Epps ! Jaeger ! It 's getting dark up here .
EPPS: I heard !
EPPS: What are you doing ?
JAEGER: What does it look like I 'm doing ?
EPPS: It looks like you 're not doing anything .
JAEGER: I 'm not . And I 'm not doing anything , ecause there 's nothing down here .
EPPS: Get up and dig .
JAEGER: We 've been digging . We 've been digging for hours . If there was anything here to find we would have found it .
EPPS: Get up off your ass and dig !
JAEGER: What 's the point ? There 's nothing here . The map 's a fake . Christ , even I see that now . We 're just wasting our time . We might as well give up and
EPPS: You listen to me . The whole reason we 're here is because of you and that map of yours . I did n't do all this for nothing , and I 'm not leaving with nothing . If you think for a second I 'm giving up just 'cause you 're too tired to turn over some dirt , then you do n't know John Epps too well , do you ? So you dig , and you keep on digging 'til I say you do n't have to dig anymore .
JAEGER: Must be a compartment .
EPPS: I feel air . Probably opens up outside somewhere . That 's where the light comes from . Could n't see it with the lanternon .
JAEGER: The white dot ; light in the dark .
EPPS: It 's giving .
JAEGER: Jesus Christ !
EPPS: No , do n't shoot !
JAEGER: Is it dead ?
EPPS: Yeah , Bwana , you got it .
JAEGER: I think we found something .
EPPS: Gold . It 's gold . Jaeger yells it at the top of his lungs
JAEGER: IT 'S GOLD !
JAEGER: It 's not like I figured . It 's cold . And it 's heavier than I imagined .
EPPS: I would n't know . I never imagined this . Not in my whole life did I ever imagine this .
JAEGER: You do n't have to imagine it . Not anymore . Now all you 've got to think up is what it 's going to buy you . Epps grabs up one coin and stands .
EPPS: Wes !
EPPS: Wes , thrown down a pack .
EPPS CONT: I do n't think the line will take the weight of a man and the coins . Wes ! ? We 'll send the gold up , then me and Jaeger 'll climb back .
JAEGER: Wait .
EPPS: What ?
EPPS CONT: What ?
JAEGER: We send the gold up what 's to stop him from taking off and leaving us down here ?
EPPS: He 's not going to leave us .
JAEGER: What 's to stop him if he wanted to ? All he has to do is cut the line Good point . What is to stop him ?
WES: You ready ?
EPPS: All right . I 'll go up , then you send up the gold and
JAEGER: Why do I have to stay down here ?
EPPS: Jesus , Jaeger .
JAEGER: I do n't see how that plan 's any better .
EPPS: Someone 's got to send the gold up . It ca n't get on the line by itself .
JAGER: Why 's it got to be me ? A tense moment passes .
WES: What are you doing ? You ready ? Another moment , then
EPPS: All right . You go up , I 'll send up the gold , then follow .
JAEGER: Yeah . Yeah , that 'll work .
EPPS: If you 're even thinking about leaving me down here , you better think again .
JAEGER: Wes , I 'm coming up .
EPPS: Okay !
EPPS CONT: Wes ? Jaeger ?
EPPS: What the hell took so long .
JAEGER: Just had to get the pack unhooked from the line . It did n't seem that long .
EPPS: Not when you 're up here with the gold , I guess not . Throwing Epps ' own words back at him
WES: Not losing trust , are you ? Epps lets this go .
EPPS: It 'll be too dark to make our way back now . Let 's bed down for the night and head out at first light .
WES: What about the gold ?
EPPS: What about it ?
WES: Maybe we should split it up now .
EPPS: We started this together , and we 're staying together , so there 's no point in splitting things up now .
WES: What if we get separated ? Way I see it if something happens I want to be carrying my share .
JAEGER: Wes might be right about that .
EPPS: It stays as it is . We 're halfway home now . Let 's not blow it by people getting ideas .
WES: You 're the one with all the ideas .
EPPS: You 've had your say , Wes . Now leave it .
WES: Maybe you 've got ideas of your own fo the gold . Maybe you 've already got things worked out .
EPPS: Maybe I do .
WES: Maybe I do n't need your ideas . Maybe I can do better on my own .
WES CONT: You got no reason to do that !
EPPS: I told you When I straighten someone out they stay straightened . This is how it works Nobody touches the gold . Except when we 're on the move and someone 's carrying it , nobody so much as opens the pack to get an eyeful of it . Agreed ? Jaeger wastes no time jumping in .
JAEGER: Yeah . Sure . That sounds like a plan to me . Wes , still on the ground , fumes .
WES: You got no reason to hit me . I 'm getting tired of you and Jaeger pushing me around .
EPPS: Then get up and do something about it .
EPPS CONT: Then just lay there and bleed .
WES: Stay down . Stay the hell down , or I will ip your stinking head off !
JAGER: What the hell ?
WES: I caught him ! I caught him trying to steal the gold .
EPPS: Get off him .
WES: He snuck in here thinking we were asleep , only I was n't sleeping . Would have slit our throats if I had n't stopped him .
EPPS: Get off him !
EPPS CONT: What happened ?
WES: I told you . He tried to steal our gold . He tried to kill us .
JAEGER: With what ? He does n't have a weapon .
WES: He 's a soldier . He does n't need a weapon . He 's got rocks . He 's got bare hands .
WES CONT: Shut up ! Epps gives Wes a hard push .
EPPS: Stop it !
WES: I told you ; do n't push me around .
EPPS: Tell me what he 's saying .
WES: Says he 's one of the soldiers that was in the helicopter .
JAEGER: He lived through that ? The soldier goes on , and so does Wes .
WES: Says they were deserters , they were afraid to fight , do n't believe in Saddam anyway . They flew the gunship up here to hide out . When they saw us they figured we were going to kill them , so they shot first .
EPPS: Why 'd he come in our camp .
WES: Says he wanted food . Liar . He wanted the gold .
EPPS: How 's he going to want the gold ? He could n't even know we had it .
WES: Hehe could have been watching us .
JAEGER: Maybe we should give him some water .
WES: All last night he could have been
JAEGER: I think he wants something to drink .
WES: I 'm not wasting my water on him .
WES CONT: I do n't care what he says , he wanted ou gold . Would have slit our throats if he had the chance .
EPPS: Does n't matter . Whatever he wanted he did n't get it . We 've got no need staying around here . It 's light enough . Let 's pack up and head out .
WES: What about him ? Wewe have to do something .
WES CONT: We ca n't just leave him . He 'll run back to his outfit , report our position
EPPS: You said he was a deserter .
WES: That 's what he says . He could be a spy , or something .
EPPS: You do n't know that .
WES: You do n't know he is n't .
JAEGER: So we 'll take him with us . At least 'til we get back to the Hummer .
WES: He 'd just slow us down , and drink ou water . And if we ran into any more Iraqis you know he 'd sell us out .
EPPS: We do n't leave him , we do n't take him with us . What does that leave ?
EPPS CONT: You 're out of your mind .
WES: He 's an enemy soldier .
EPPS: I 'm not going to let you kill him .
WES: We 're at war . The discussion starts to get real heated .
EPPS: We are not at war ! You and I and Jaege are AWOL . We have no authority
WES: He tried to kill us . If not just now , then in the helicopter . That 's all the authority I need . Jaeger goes somewhere near panic .
JAEGER: We do n't need to do this . We got the gold , all right ? Let 's just get out of here .
WES: I 'm not going to leave him be just so he can stab us in the backs the minute we turn around . I have been through too much to lose it all now just because the two of you do n't have the stomach to do what has to be done .
EPPS: I 've got no stomach for murder .
WES: It 's a combat action .
EPPS: It 's murder , and I wo n't be any part of it .
WES: Then step aside .
EPPS: No .
WES: Get out of my way .
JAEGER: For Christ 's sake , we do n't need this . Let 's just go . Let 's justlet 's just get out of here . Wes yells down at the Iraqi .
WES: Shut up ! Shut the hell up !
JAGER: He 's getting away !
WES: I had to . You saw how he ran . Would have given us away . I had to . There 's a beat of quiet , then
JAEGER: Maybe we ought toyou know , bury him . Say some words over him .
WES: You want to say some words ? He sneers down at the body .
WES CONT: Go to hell . How are those words ?
EPPS: We should head Northeast .
JAEGER: Northeast ? That 's away from the Hummer ; further into Iraqi .
EPPS: There 's another pass on the photo . We can avoid that narrow one we had to cross on the way up , and it should get us back down .
JAEGER: It should , or it will ? Least going back the way we came we know what we 're up against .
EPPS: You think you can make that pass weighted down when you almost fell the first time you 're wrong , and you 're not going to take my share of the gold with you trying it . We 're heading Northeast . Really calm , cold and direct Wes says
WES: You 've got an awful lot of orders in you . Always giving orders .
EPPS: I out rank you , that 's why .
WES: In the service you do , but we 're not particularly in the service right now . Way I see it , what we 're doing , that does n't particularly give you the right to toss orders around .
EPPS: We been down this road . I told you how it is . Unless you feel like there 's something you want to do about it
WES: What if I do ?
WES CONT: What if I do ? He works the action of his M-16 .
EPPS: Something happens to me I let go of this grenade . I go , and I take the navicom with me . And how do you suppose you 're going to find your way back to the Hummer , when you wo n't even know what 's up o down . It 's a big country , and you could e heading for the allies , or wandering ight into Bhagdad . That 's if you do n't die of thirst before you even get that far . How you like my stick now ?
JAEGER: Why do n't you put the gun down , all ight , Wes ? You put the gun down and Epps 'll put the pin back in the grenade . Wo n't you Epps ?
WES: I 'm starting to think you 're a real itch , you know that ?
JAEGER: You 're going to burn up in those .
WES: The white reflects the sun ; it keeps you cooler . That 's why they wear them .
JAEGER: Think the Iraqi 's killed them all ?
WES: Probably shot a few . Scattered the rest . Murderers .
EPPS: Murder , or a combat action ? It 's hard to tell them apart ?
WES: You saw how he ran did n't you ? First chance he got he ran out . Would have gone straight to his CO , told him all about the gold . What do you think would have happened then , huh ? Then what do you think would have happened ? Two thousand screaming Iraqis bearing down on us . You ought to thank me for killing him . I 'll get a medal for it . Watch and see if I do n't get a medal .
EPPS: What the hell ?
EPPS CONT: Help ! Help me !
JAEGER: WesWes !
EPPS: The navicom !
JAEGER: What are we going to do ? How are we going to find our way back ! ?
EPPS: We 'll find our way .
JAEGER: How ! ?
EPPS: We 'll find our way ! We 'll
WES: No navicom . A lot of good you are now , Epps .
EPPS: Lot of good you were when I was sinking in the sand .
WES: Without that navicam looks to me like you forfeit the right to be in charge .
EPPS: And let me guess who is . Wes casually slides out his M-16 .
WES: I 'm the one 's got the big stick .
EPPS: Suppose I do n't go for that ?
WES: Then I suppose it 'd be insurrection , and I suppose I 'd have to kill you . I suppose .
EPPS: What about Jaeger ?
WES: Nothing about him , unless he 's got a problem about me dealing with you .
JAEGER: Yeah , I got a problem with you killing Epps .
JAEGER CONT}: I mean , in principle .
WES: { Sneering ) You know , Jaeger , you really are a bitch .
WES CONT: You die !
EPPS: We got to go back . We got to go back fo Wes .
JAEGER: Forget Wes .
EPPS: We ca n't just leave him .
JAEGER: Wes is dead !
EPPS: What if he 's not ?
JAEGER: Then he will be when those Iraqis get to him . He was going to kill you . He was one blink away from it . He 's dead , Epps , and I 'm sure as hell not getting my head low off over his carcass .
JAEGER CONT: It 's a helicopter .
JAGER CONT: There .
JAEGER CONT: Ours , or theirs ?
EPPS: Ours . It 's one of ours . We 've got to signal them ; let them know we 're down here .
JAEGER: No .
EPPS: We need something A flare , a signal mirror .
JAEGER: No .
EPPS: What do you mean no ? They can fly us home .
JAEGER CONT: They 'll ask questions ; want to know why we were out here .
EPPS: We 'll lie .
JAEGER: They 'll search the pack .
JAEGER CONT: They 'll find the gold . Epps turns sharply back to Jaeger .
EPPS: We 're lost , you understand that ? We 've got no navicom , and no means to find a way back . So right now I do n't give a damn about the gold because if we do n't get off this desert , and out of Iraqi all it 's going to be good for is buying us tombstones .
JAEGER: I ca n't do it , Epps . Not when we 're so close . I ca n't let you ruin everything .
EPPS: First Wes , now you ?
JAEGER: I 'm not like Wes . Wes was crazy .
EPPS: And you ; you 've got it all together .
JAEGER: I do n't want it this way . I would n't kill you just to kill you , but I ca n't let you lose the gold for me . Not when we 're so close .
EPPS: That helicopter passes , and the only thing we 're close to is death . Jaeger is unfazed . Very politely he says
JAEGER: Sit down , Epps .
JAEGER CONT: I 'm sorry about that , Epps .
EPPS: Is it all right if I stand up ?
JAEGER: Oh , yeah . Go ahead .
JAEGER CONT: I 'm glad I did n't have to kill you . I 'm glad it did n't come to that .
EPPS: Yeah . Well , me too .
JAEGER: I never killed anybody before . I talk a good game , but I 'm not like that .
EPPS: Sure .
JAEGER: Really , I 'm not . Remember how I was talking I wanted to blow away all those Iraqis ? That 's all it was was talk . I was scared out of my mind to go to war . I still have n't gotten over stepping on that land mine .
EPPS: You still got a map on you ?
JAEGER: What ? Yeah .
JAEGER CONT: Epps ?
EPPS: Yeah .
JAEGER: I do n't want to die .
EPPS: Makes two of us .
JAEGER: I know what I did just now was crazy , but you got to understand how much I want that gold .
EPPS: It 's all right . I do n't like it , but it 's over now .
JAEGER: I never had anything before , Epps . I never was anybody . Not the kind of somebody you can be with a pocket full of gold coins . When I was in high school I used to Fed up with Jaeger Epps turns on him hard .
EPPS: Hey , you know what ? Can I be honest with you ? Right now I 'm not all that interested in how you 're messed up 'cause you did n't get the bicycle you wanted fo your thirteenth birthday . What I 'm interested in is how I can keep from getting dead . And listening to so stories from some about how the system was n't good to him because he had to work like everybody else instead of eing born a Kennedy does n't do a damn thing to help keep me alive . So do me a favor ; either shut up , orjust shut up . Jaeger is n't sure what to say .
JAEGER: Sorry .
EPPS: Damn .
JAEGER: What do you think our chances are ?
EPPS: If we can find the Hummer , or some friendlies by sundown we might be okay . We 've got enough water for that . But we wo n't make another day otherwise . Again they sit for a beat .
JAEGER: Wonder how the war 's going ?
EPPS: It 's got to be going better than this.. Epps stands and has a last look around .
EPPS{CONT: All right . pick a direction . Jaeger just gives a surprised look .
EPPS CONT: We ca n't just sit here . We 've got to start moving , so pick .
JAEGER: You sure you want me too ?
JAEGER CONT: I pick that way .
EPPS: Okay . Then we go this way . Epps heads off in the opposite direction .
JAEGER: Getting cold .
EPPS: It 's a desert . That 's what deserts do at night ; they get cold .
JAEGER: EppsEpps ! I 'm gon na stop for a second .
EPPS: No !
JAEGER: Just let me rest for a second .
EPPS: We 've got to keep moving while there 's still light .
JAEGER: You know what I 'm going to do ? I 'm just going to take a second . I want to look at the gold .
EPPS: Do n't you touch it .
JAEGER: I just want to look at it . Remind me of what I 'm dying for .
EPPS: The deal was no one touches it until we get out of here .
JAEGER: Yeah , but we made that deal while Wes was still alive . He 's gone . Time for a new deal .
JAEGER: Look .
JAEGER CONT: What do you figure it is ?
EPPS: Place all alone like that ? Must be a oarder check point .
JAEGER: Which boarder ? Saudi ? Kuwait ? Syria ?
EPPS: Could n't be Syria . We could n't have gone that far north . It 's got to be Saudi . Come on .
EPPS CONT}: They 've got to have water . We 'll get same water , some directions , maybe they even have a vehicle .
JAEGER: Epps .
EPPS: We can head back for our lines , and they do n't even have to know about the gold .
JAEGER: Epps . What if they 're not Saudi .
JAEGER CONT: If it 's a checkpoint , it could be Iraqi . Epps considers this .
EPPS: We 've got no cboice . Either way , we 've got no choice .
JAEGER: Well ?
EPPS: Well , we should identify ourselves .
JAEGER: Yeah , I guess we should .
EPPS: Even if they are Iraqis probably all they 'll do is take us prisoner fo awhile . Got to figure we 're still kicking their asses in the war . They do n't want any trouble .
JAEGER: Hell , they 'll probably just surrender to us . Probably .
EPPS: That 's if the war is even still going on . Way things were shaping up it 's probably long over .
JAEGER: Probably .
EPPS: Hellooooo
JAEGER: Ashra Ka mahari dahra sahib ! Ashra Ka mahari dahra sahib ! < /i
EPPS: What did you say ?
JAEGER: I do n't know . Something Wes had taught me . I think it means `` Do n't shoot . We 're your friends . ''
EPPS: They must be Saudis . It 's a Saudi checkpoint . Oh sweet , Jesus . Come on . Come on !
JAGER: Oh , man , this is good . What do you think the chances are they 've got a whirlpool in this place ?
JAEGER CONT: Oh , God
EPPS: They must have thought we were Iraqi when you yelled to them . They could n't tell in the dark .
JAEGER: What are we going to do ? Epps thinks . What are they going to do ?
EPPS: Slip out your M-16 .
JAEGER: And then what ?
EPPS: And then shoot them .
JAEGER: II never killed anyone before . I told you that .
EPPS: Well , you 're going to start with a bang , 'cause you 've got four of them to take down .
JAEGER: Ca n't you
EPPS: I do n't have a weapon .
EPPS CONT: Do n't go bitch on me now ! You were going to kill me . Kill them !
JAEGER: I just said I would . I do n't think I
EPPS: Shoot them !
EPPS CONT: Shoot them , Jaeger ! SHOOT THEM !
JAEGER: EppEpps ! There 's someone at the window ! This wakes Epps up quick .
EPPS: An Iraqi ?
JAEGER: I do n't know . He did n't have a uniform on . Hehe had on white robes , like the guys who killed Wes .
JAGER CONT: See anything ?
EPPS: Nothing .
JAEGER: What do we do ?
EPPS: We ca n't stay here . Even if that was n't an Iraqi soldier it 's only a matter of time before some show up . Get all the water you can carry , and we 'll head out on foot .
JAEGER: To where ?
EPPS: Sun rises in the East . We go the opposite direction . May not find anything , but at least we 'll know we 're heading towards Saudi Arabia .
EPPS CONT: Ready ?
JAEGER: Look !
JAEGER CONT: What do we do ?
EPPS: We keep going , that 's what we do . We ignore them , maybe they ignore us .
JAEGER: Jesus ! How many of them are there ?
EPPS: I do n't like this . Let 's go .
JAEGER: What do you make of them ?
EPPS: Shi'ites , I think .
JAEGER: Is that good , or bad ?
EPPS: I do n't know . They killed Wes .
JAEGER: Why have n't they killed us ! ?
EPPS: I do n't know !
JAEGER: Maybemaybe we can fight our way out .
EPPS: With what ? Against how many ?
JAEGER: We ca n't just sit here waiting to die .
EPPS: You come up with a better plan , let me know .
JAEGER: Maybemaybe if we traded them the gold . If we gave it to them they might let us live ; they might not kill us . From O.C . we hear a voice
EPPS: Wes ?
JAEGER: You were shot . We were standing right there , you were shot !
WES: In the flack jacket . Still like getting hit in the back with a baseball bat . Took the air right out of me , but I was just unconscious for awhile . 'Course , you did n't stick around to find that out . You left me for dead .
EPPS: We thought
WES: YOU LEFT ME FOR DEAD !
WES CONT: When my Shi'ite friends saw that they had shot an American they were very apologetic . Turns out we 've been kicking ass in this little war . They figure we 've finally gotten Saddam off thei acks . They brought me to their camp , cleaned me up , fed me I 'm their new est buddy . America number one , Joe . But there 's something the Shi'ites ca n't figure out They ca n't figure out why my two buddies , two fellow Americans , left me out in the desert . They ca n't seem to figure out what those same two guys were doing in an Iraqi outpost . It 's almost as if they were Iraqi spies , o something . And I 've got to tell you they hate anything that 's got to do with the Iraqis . See how I mean ?
JAEGER: We had to take shelter in the checkpoint . Jesus , Wes , I killed the Iraqis in there .
WES: You actually got around to killing someone . I 'm impressed . I guess you 're only half a bitch .
EPPS: Wes , we thought you were dead , and we thought we were next . Hanging around to get killed would n't have done anyone any good .
WES: Sure , and I guess it was just convenient there was one less person to split the gold with .
EPPS: Wes
WES: Look , I know you guys are telling the truth . It 's just the Shi'ites do n't know that . I guess you could tell thembut then you do n't speak the language do you ? Wes gets right up into Jaeger 's face .
WES{CONT: Do you ! ?
WES CONT: Thanks for taking care of this for me .
EPPS: Tell me something , Wes . Are you crazy , greedy , or just stupid ? Jaeger says you 're crazy .
JAEGER: I did n't say that . I never said
EPPS: Me ? I say you do n't have enough brains to be stupid .
WES: You disappoint me , Epps . Always figured you to be a man ; a real bright guy . I had respect for you .
EPPS: That why you tried to put a bullet in my head in the middle of the desert .
WES: That 's just what things came to . Sometimes you ca n't help that . It does n't change me respecting you . And now you let me down . I expected more from you , you know ? I really did . I expected you to
EPPS: You expect this ? Wes ' got nothing to say . To Jaeger
EPPS CONT: Get the gold ! Jaeger grabs up the pack .
WES: They 'll kill you . You wo n't make it ten feet before they cut you down .
EPPS: You do n't know John Epps very well , do you ?
JAEGER: Can you ride a horse ?
EPPS: No , but I figure now 's a real good time to start .
EPPS CONT: Do n't say anything .
WES: I have to answer him .
EPPS: So you can give us away ?
WES: If I do n't answer , he 'll know something 's up .
EPPS: You answer him , but you answer him wrong and you 're going to be staring at you insides while you 're dying .
EPPS CONT: Bastard !
WES: Stop them !
JAEGER: They coming ?
EPPS: Oh , yeah . They 're coming .
EPPS CONT: Ride for the hills . We 'll try to lose them .
JAEGER: We lost them !
JAEGER CONT: Which way ?
EPPS: We go this way .
EPPS CONT: Jaeger !
WES: The gold ; give it to me .
WES CONT: Give it to me !
EPPS: If I give it to you , will you let us go ?
WES: Sure . Whatever you want . For old time sake .
WES CONT: Looks like at the end of the day we finally find out who 's better than who , do n't we , Epps ? Like I said ; I expected more from you .
EPPS: It 's like I said ; you do n't really know lieutenant John Epps very well , do you ?
EPPS CONT: Damn it . We lost the horses .
JAEGER: Thethe gold
EPPS: It was n't the gold . It was the claymore mine . The gold 's in my pack .
JAEGER: When did you make the switch ?
EPPS: It 's always been like that . When you left me down in the crevice to send the gold up I figured I 'd bettertake precautions . I rigged it to blow if anyone opened the pack . Just in case somebody thought they could do better on their own .
JAEGER: But
EPPS: We had a deal . No one touches the gold until we 're out of here . No one breaks the deal , no one had anything to worry about .
JAEGER: What if it had n't been Wes ? What ifI mean , accidently , what if I had
EPPS: You should n't think about things like that . It 'll just make you crazy .
JAEGER: Well ?
EPPS: A car 's got to come along sooner o later . When it does , we jack it .
JAEGER: How do we do that ?
EPPS: You lie in the middle of the road , look like you 're hurt . When the car stops I un over to the driver and put a gun to his head .
JAEGER: Why do I have to lie in the road ?
EPPS: Somebody has to .
JAEGER: Yeah , but why me ? What if the ca does n't stop ?
EPPS: Then I 'm a rich man .
JAEGER: Epps .
EPPS: Yeah .
JAEGER: I want you to know I do n't know . I just think you 're a hell of a guy .
EPPS: Thanks .
JAEGER: This whole time , you 've kept your head . You did n't go money simple like me and Wes . You 've just been trying to figure how to get us out of here . And you 've een fair too . I mean , even afte Iyou know
EPPS: Threatened to blow my brains out ?
JAEGER: Yeah . Even after that . You did n't take it out on me , except for maybe making me lie in the middle of the road now . But I 'd say you 've been very fair . I just think it 's a hell of a man who can keep from going money simple .
EPPS: Do n't make so much out of it . Only eason I have n't figured a way to get all that money for myself is because I 've een too busy figuring ways to stay alive . Believe me ; if I had a minute to catch my breath I might have played things the way you and Wes had . I 'm no etter than anybody else . I 've just been usier . They sit a while more . Still no car .
JAEGER: Epps ?
EPPS: What ?
JAEGER: I 'm thinking about taking a trip .
EPPS: Thought you were going to buy a car .
JAEGER: Still am . There 's more gold than I thought , and since there 's only two of us now Where should I go ?
EPPS: I do n't know .
JAEGER: I 've never been anywhere . I would n't know where to go . Where would you go ?
EPPS: How the hell should I know ? Another long beat . Still no car .
EPPS CONT: Australia .
JAEGER: What ?
EPPS: I 'd go to Australia . Lot of land , not many people . I think after this I 'd like to quit people for awhile . And the girls go crazy for brothers down there .
JAEGER: Really ?
EPPS: That 's what I hear . Do n't matter . Girls go crazy everywhere for a man with gold .
JAEGER: Well , this is it . We get the car , find some Americans . We find Americans we 'll e all right .
EPPS: We 'll make up some kind of lie . They wo n't find the gold .
JAEGER: Okay . See you in a minute .
JAEGER CONT: Epps , I do n't think he 's slowing down .
EPPS: He 'll slow down . The car gets closer .
JAEGER: He 's not slowing .
EPPS: He 's going to slow down . The car gets closer .
JAEGER: EppsEpps !
JAEGER CONT: Aw , damn !
EPPS: You speak English ? DO YOU SPEAK
DRIVER: Y-yes .
EPPS: Where were you going ?
DRIVER: Baghdad .
EPPS: What 's in the other direction ?
DRIVER: This road , it leads straight to Kuwait .
EPPS: Turn the car around .
DRIVER: Please , I beg of you . The American army is there . I am Iraqi . They will kill me .
EPPS: Nobody 's going to hurt you .
EPPS CONT: You see that ? Gold . You take us to the Americans , and we 'll give you anothe one . Now drive .
DRIVER: You are Americans , yes ? Neither Jaeger or Epps answer .
DRIVER CONT: We did n't not all want this war , do you know ? We did n't not all want to invade our brothers and sisters in Kuwait . Now your army crushes us . So few days , and so many have died . And many fear we will all die . Please tell this to you people We did not want this war .
EPPS: Yeah . We 'll look for him .
JAEGER: Look at this .
DRIVER: Iraqis . They are fleeing from Kuwait , from your military .
EPPS: See if you ca n't drive around this .
JAEGER: What the hell are they doing ? There 're civilians in there .
EPPS: The gold !
JAEGER: No !
CHIEF JUSTICE: The members of this tribunal have reached a verdict . Based on the evidence presented we find the defended guilty as charged of desertion , insurrection , insubordination , and conduct unbecoming . Further the tribunal will recommend that the defendant be sentenced to life imprisonment , and that from this day forward he shall no longer walk as a free man . You should consider yourself quite fortunate , son . There was a time when lesser crimes would have found you before a firing squad . I do n't know that a person like you has much to say fo himself , but it is your right say something .
JAEGER: I 'm sorry , I guess . Not for looking fo the gold , or leaving my post . You know what it 's like to have gold raining out of your hands ? That 'll give me enough to think about the rest of my days in the ig . I 'm just sorry about Wes . He was all right . It was the gold that made him what he became . If I had n't found that map , if I had n't talked them into going searchingWes just might have made it home after all . I guess I feel esponsible for him .
CHIEF JUSTICE: The way I view things you 're responsible for the lives of two men Private First Class Wes Hanmond , and Second Lieutenant John Epps .
JAEGER: Yeah , well , I 've been thinking about that . See , there was an explosion and everything , but I never really aaw Epps get killed . And nobody ever found the gold . I guess they both could have been urned to slag . I guess . But there were a lot of bodies out on that road . A smart man could have found some identification to use . A smart man could have made his way up to Syria or Turkey . A smart man could have gotten himself ight out of the Middle East . A smart man with enough gold . Way I figure , ight about now old Epps is sitting in a ar in Sydney , or Melboure , or maybe Brisbane telling stories to one of the prettiest Aussies you ever saw . The members of the tribunal just scoff .
CHIEF JUSTICE: I find it highly unlikely that anyone could accomplish such a thing .
JAEGER: Well , Sir , I guess you do n't know Second Lieutenant John Epps very well , do you ?

MICHAEL: Rock-a-bye baby on the tree top
WOMAN #1: Does she have any teeth yet o not ? That would give us a clue as to how old she is .
PETER: I have n't looked .
STORE CLERK: My grandson 's only five months old and he already has two teeth . But my daughter did n't have a single one at seven months so , y'know , how many teeth they have does n't mean a thing .
WOMAN #2: But did n't those friends of yours tell you what formula they usually give the baby ?
PETER: No , actually they had to leave unexpectedly . They had to catch a plane
WOMAN #1: Is she teething ?
PETER: Teething ?
WOMAN #1: Does she drool ? Does she cry all night long ? Does she chew on he fists ? Does she put everything into her mouth ? She acts out her words .
PETER: I know she ca n't talk .
PETER: I told you they had to leave unexpectedly .
WOMAN #1: Or else you could weigh her ; that would tell you how old she is .
STORE CLERK: See , my five-month-old grandson weighs more than my neighbor 's grandson and he 's nine months old . So , y'know , how much they weigh does n't mean a thing .
PETER: So what about me ? What should I uy ?
WOMAN #2: Did n't they even tell you the pediatrician 's name ?
PETER: No . They did n't .
WOMAN #2: You sure have weird friends .
PETER: You have no idea how weird .
WOMAN #1: Or else her hair . Does she have lots of hair ?
STORE CLERK: My grandson , y'know , he has so much hair you can make a ponytail with it ! And I know some kids who are totally bald at a year- and-a-half . So , y'know , how much hair they have does n't mean a thing
WOMAN #1: Gee , he 's really something , you grandson is he good at math too ?
PETER: Look , ladies , thanks for all the advice . But I think I 'll just take one of each . To be on the safe side .
STOCK CLERK: Do n't forget if the baby 's less than three months old , you have to be sure to sterilize the ottles . Peter stops and turns back .
PETER: What bottles ?

MICHAEL: This way it 's close at hand !
PETER: Are you out of your mind ? ?
MICHAEL: Relax , will you .
PETER: I told the cops we were taking care of her . You realize we 're now stuck with the kid till Jack
MICHAEL: Wait a minute . You 're not gon na stick me with this kid ! Tell them you need a maternity leave , tell them anything , but we 've got to go 50-50 on this !

PETER: Good idea ! Let 's go .
MICHAEL: Wait I hear someone I 'll go see
RAZZOLINI: Yes , I brought a package up to them I think it was last Sunday
AGENT #1: What are these people like ? What kind of lifestyle do they have ?
MICHAEL: Just as I thought the goddamn cops are grilling Mrs. Razzolini .
PETER: Oh shit ! We sure as hell ca n't hand her the baby with an ass full of dope right in front of the narcs ! The elevator has arrived meanwhile .
MICHAEL: Listen , she 's just had her bottle . She 's sleeping like a log . Let 's just leave her in the apartment . What can possibly happen to her ? She 's as regular as clockwork . She wo n't wake up till 8 30 and we 'll easily be back by then

AGENT #1: Oh , really ? Well , if I were you I 'd get myself some new friends ! Peter comes in , in his bathrobe , furious .

PETER: Bullshit , it 's a trick .
MICHAEL: You think so ? Really ?
PETER: They just said that to put us off guard . They saw the condition this apartment 's in .
MICHAEL: But he said the investigation was closed .
PETER: Okay , let 's just see how closed it is . I 'll go downstairs . You watch out the window and see if I 'm being tailed .
MICHAEL: There 's one guy for sure ! A edhead , kind of young , disguised sort of like a college student .
PETER: I knew it . They 're going to be watching us around the clock .
MICHAEL: I have the feeling they 'll come to us .
PETER: We 'll have to be very careful .
PUNK: Hi ! Doin ' a little shopping , huh ? How 's your place not too much damage , I hope .
MICHAEL: What do you guys want ?
PUNK: We want the dope . Tomorrow .

PUNK: That 's your problem , man . Figure out a way to shake 'em . Either we safely get the dope tomorrow , o you , your friend and the kid 'll get this . We 'll call you tonight .
GRATON: My snitch told me the gang has n't gotten the dope back yet , ut they will soon . They made contact with the two guys tonight No , no , they do n't know I 'm tailing them . These jerks are going to fall right into my hands

GRATON: We got 'em , Chief . Five o'clock
JACK: Yoo-hoo , guys ! I 'm home ! I 've got presents for you so where 's that wonderful fantastic babe
PETER: Would it be asking too much of you to shut your big mouth for a few seconds ? There is a child here who 's trying to sleep .
JACK: And that 's another thing ! I will not have a baby in this house ! Babies are not part of our agreement !
PETER: Michael , please hold me back o I 'll kill him .
MICHAEL: All right , Jack . Why do n't we start at the very beginning . The very day you left for you vacation
JACK: Hey , will you please stop talking like Mr. Rogers ? It 's getting on my nerves .
PETER: His nerves ! Ha . Ha . Ha . His nerves ! Michael , his nerves ! You wan na talk about nerves ! Then just shut up and listen . It so happens we do n't want a kid here either , but when someone dumps one on us , we take goddamn care of it .
MICHAEL: Yeah , we take goddam care of it .
PETER: We have n't had a decent night 's sleep in two weeks . Michael 's probably going to lose a $ 15,000 contract
MICHAEL: Peter could n't leave . Jerry almost jumped out the window . It 's lucky they even made it to the finals !
JACK: What ?
PETER: First , we 've got the narcs on ou ass , then there 's the drug gang threatening to carve us up . Then ottles bottles every three hours , bottles .
MICHAEL: And diapers . Have you ever tried to do diapers ?
PETER: 'La Paz , Bolivia ' He calls from ' I 'm onto something hot . ' He says . 'Did the package get there ? ' He says . You asshole !
MICHAEL: And the day they wrecked the apartment , Peter came home and could n't find Mary . I 've neve seen him in tears like that bef
PETER: Never mind about that . Look , Jack , you got us into this mess , and you 're going to help us get out of it .
JACK: What are you guys talking about ? What narcs ? What gang ? And who 's that fucking baby ?
PETER: For your information , the 'fucking ' aby 's name is Mary . And if I were you , I 'd watch what I said about her because she just so happens to be your daughter !
JACK: What ? ?
MICHAEL: And it just so happens , we 've got a lot better things to do with ou lives than wipe a baby 's ass , even if she 's yours ! Peter and Michael exit , slamming the door .
JACK: It 's ridiculous . I look idiculous .
PETER: You look completely ridiculous so what ?
GRATON: Okay , he 's coming out alone . I 'll follow him . Someone else stay here to keep an eye on the other guys .

GRATON: Inspector Graton , Narcotics . Do you admit you gave these men this package ?
MICHAEL: Sure . I gave it to them , just a moment ago .
GRATON: Officer , will you please open this package in front of these witnesses ?
MICHAEL: Is it against the law to give a ox of candy to my friends ? Peter and Jack take off their glasses .
GRATON: Oh , it 's you guys !
PETER: What 's the problem ?
GRATON: You guys must think you 're pretty smart , do n't ya ? Holy shit ! The diaper !

MICHAEL: Then she should give her a bottle of water instead of the regula ottle . Works like a charm He ass will be white as snow in three hours .
JACK: Bottle of water , white as snow
MICHAEL: Peter says her clothes should be washed by hand
JACK: Really , by hand ?
MICHAEL: And only in soap flakes without any artificial color or scent . And then rinsed three times in very hot water .
JACK: Rinse three times .

MARGIE: Hey , he finally made it !
JACK: But , Mom , I missed the plane .
MARGIE: Yeah , but now I have to go .
JACK: Where are you going ?
MARGIE: On a cruise around the world .
JACK: But why did n't you say so on the phone ?
MARGIE: Because you never would 've come . Now let me see her . Oh , my little strudle !
MARGIE: Bye-bye , sweetie love I 'll ing you back presents from all over the world . Four o'clock .
JACK: 'Bye !
PETER: You 're bringing her back ?
JACK: Yeah she 's starving . I got ta heat this bottle up right away .
PETER: So what happened ? Did you two have a fight ?
JACK: Goddamn cruises
PETER: Did n't she want to take her ?
JACK: Sure she did , but she was just leaving for some stupid cruise around the world . The entire fucking world ! With some bimbo oyfriend of her 's and a bunch of retired bozos .
JACK: What ?
MRS. BRETSAWS: Good afternoon . I 'm Mathilda Bretsaws , from The Second Mommy agency .
JACK: Oh , yes , I was expecting you . Wo n't you come in
PETER: Who is it ?
MICHAEL: Must be some nanny he found through an agency . Peter shrugs and walks away . Jack comes out of the living room .
JACK: She wants to see Mary .
MICHAEL: She 's asleep .
JACK: Well , she wants to see her anyway ! He heads toward Peter 's room .
PETER: What do you want ?
JACK: Nothing , nothing .
PETER: Do n't go into my room , she 's asleep .
JACK: Yeah , but the nanny , Mrs. Bretsaws , she wants to see her .
PETER: No , damn it , no ! You 're gon na wake her up ! It already took me an hour to sing her to sleep
JACK: Yeah , but she wants to see her .
PETER: All right , I 'll go explain the situation .
JACK: No , no , Peter , please , really , do n't go , do n't bother , I 'll go explain it to her myself
PETER: It 's no bother , Jack . I 'll be glad to do it . He rushes toward the living room .
JACK: Wan na bet she 's out of here in ten minutes slamming the doo ehind her ?
PETER: A sleeping child should not be awakened . If you do n't know that , then you 're not fit to be a nanny .
MRS. BRETSAWS: I never said that I wanted the child to be awakened , sir . I only asked to see her . If I 'm going to be taking care of the child on a round-the-clock basis , then
PETER: 'Round-the-clock ' ? Whaddya mean 'round the clock ' ? Are you intending to sleep here ?
MRS. BRETSAWS: Absolutely , sir . A second mommy is a second mommy .
PETER: And where are you going to sleep ?
MRS. BRETSAWS: Well , I expect you to show me to my quarters .
PETER: Well , I do n't know where Jack intends to stick you That 's his problem Maybe in his room But I 'm warning you , Mrs. Brestshow .
MRS. BRETSAWS: Bretsaws .
PETER: There are three of us sharing this place and we 're all real studs .
MRS. BRETSAWS: And as for screwing , I have all I need at home , thank you very much . With a few days off every month , I 'm sure I 'll be fine . The only thing I 'm interested in is the care of the child and I can tell she needs some .
PETER: Oh , yeah ? How do you figure that ?
MRS. BRETSAWS: Should n't I be discussing all this with the father ?
PETER: Well , listen , Mrs. Fretsaw , umm Brainsore
MRS. BRETSAWS: Bretsaws , Mrs. Bretsaws .
PETER: Right Bratsnot , lem me tell you something . With a child you always know who the mother is , ut the father that 's anothe kettle of fish . So do n't give me that bullshit , okay ?
MRS. BRETSAWS: Very well . I wo n't discuss it any further with you . Will you please show me where the kitchen and the athroom are ?
PETER: What for ?
MRS. BRETSAWS: So I can make you a list of the things we need .
PETER: What do you mean , make you a list ? Do n't you do the shopping yourself ?
MRS. BRETSAWS: No shopping or laundry o housekeeping . I am a professional nanny .
PETER: We have plenty of everything .
MRS. BRETSAWS: Do you have a sufficient amount of fruit and vegetables for the child ?
PETER: She only eats milk and cereal .
MRS. BRETSAWS: That 's not enough , sir . From the age of three months children should be started on a normal , varied diet .
PETER: Oh that 's bullshit . You do n't feed a baby like an adult .
MRS. BRETSAWS: Oh , really ? And how would you know ?
PETER: I 've read plenty of books . The diet recommended by those quack pediatricians today is way too ich . I 'm in favor of natural methods , Mrs. Breathmint .
MRS. BRETSAWS: Bretsaws , Mrs. Bretsaws .
PETER: For instance , if a child is having trouble getting to sleep , what would you do ?
MRS. BRETSAWS: Depends , if it was a continuing problem , I might recommend a mild sedative
PETER: I knew you 'd say something like that , you jerk !
MRS. BRETSAWS: No , I do n't . We must listen to different music . Personally I 'm very fond of opera .
PETER: Mrs. Breakballs , if you do n't get out of here right this minute I 'm gon na punch you in the nose ! This is my home , now get out !
MRS. BRETSAWS: The name 's Bretsaws . I am lessed with infinite patience when it comes to children , sir , ut I 'm not qualified to deal with lunatics . Goodbye and good luck !
JACK: What did I tell you ? Ten minutes to the second !
MICHAEL: Look , her mother 'll be back in less than five months . Let 's not waste a shitload of time looking for a solution for such a short time . Let 's get organized .
JACK: What do you mean , organized ?
PETER: Well , you 'll have to ask to fly the New York-Washington shuttle for five months , on account of serious personal problems .
JACK: What ? Never ! I 'd rather be a subway conductor .
PETER: Then dump her in an orphanage , 'cause there 's no way we 're gon na take care of her all by ourselves anymore !
MICHAEL: Come on , stop arguing , you two ! Jack , you 're going to have to ask to do the New York-Washington shu
JACK: No ! Never .
MICHAEL: That way , you can do the 6-10 A.M. shift . That amounts to two bottles and two diaper changes . You do the shopping when you get home in the evening and that 's all . Peter , you 'll take the 6-10 P.M. shift . That 's two bottles and two diape changes , her bath and her laundry . Since I work at home I 'll take the longest shift from 10 A.M. to 6 P.M . I 'll take her to the park for an hour , but that 's it . No shopping , no cooking , no cleaning .
PETER: What if she gets up at night ?
MICHAEL: Well I thought you might do it
PETER: Not a chance ! I 'm not doing the night shift . I absolutely refuse . I have too much work to catch up on for the competition .
JACK: Well , needless to say I refuse , too !
MICHAEL: Listen to me , you selfish bastards ! My shift is eight hours in a row . No way I 'm gon na do nights too . After 6 P.M. she can scream all she wants , I do n't give a shit .
PETER: You know , Jack , you 're a real slime ball ! We give you the easiest shift the morning . She 's always in great shape in the morning , is n't she ? We 've got to work like crazy to save our jobs and you have the nerve to refuse nights . Goddamit , she 's your daughter . Are you that horny ?
JACK: Hey , horny yourself ! I do n't give a shit . I do n't need you guys . I 'll find some other way to do it . And I wo n't take the New York-Washington shuttle ! He exits , furious .
PAUL: Hi , Jack , something wrong ?
JACK: Oh , hi Nah , nothing 's wrong .
PAUL: What were you doing in the boss 's office ?
JACK: I was asking to do the New York- Washington shuttle for a few months .
PAUL: Oh , and he said 'no , ' huh ?
JACK: As a matter of fact , he said 'yes . '
JACK: No , she needs to burp I 've got ta rock her for a little
PETER: I 'm telling you , the more you pick her up , the longer it 'll take her to get to sleep .
JACK: Thanks for the advice now why do n't you just shove it ? I know you let her scream for hours but I ca n't .
PETER: I never let her scream for hours !
JACK: You 'd resort to any theory to not take care of her . Just because you 've read some books
PETER: Can you believe what he just said to me I read those books ec
JACK: It 's not your shift , anyway . Piss off , will ya ?
MICHAEL: Come on , guys , cool it ! It 's my shift now . I 'll rock her for a few minutes and then I 'll put her right to ed . So off to work , both of you . He pushes them both out .
PETER: Hi , Michael , I just came back to get a file I forgot
MICHAEL: Yeah , okay . Silence .
PETER: Well , I guess I 'll be going now .
MICHAEL: Yeah They 're both uneasy .
PETER: The baby okay ?

PETER: Ca n't she speak softly like everyone else ?
JACK: Listen , at night I 'm in charge . So get off my back , will you ?
MICHAEL: Will you quit fighting all the time ? She just fell asleep , fo Chrissake .
JACK: Oh , Michael , go to hell ! I 'm sick and tired of your little 'Father Knows Best ' number !
PETER: Yeah , you 're right , I 'm fed up with it , too !
MICHAEL: Okay , that 's it . Into the kitchen .
JACK: I did n't ask you to get up , I know what I have to do .

MICHAEL: I 'm not a punching bag ! You assholes !
JACK: If I ca n't bring a girl back here anymore , just say so . And I 'm gone . I 'm outta here . With Mary .
PETER: You can bring whoever you want as long as they speak softly like everyone else !

SYLVIA: 'Cause my place is tiny , y'know , and my schedule 's insane and I just finished four days of posing and we ended up every day at
JACK: Yeah
SYLVIA: And every day we finished at three in the morning and since Mary always gets up around 5 30
JACK: Yeah
SYLVIA: Well , you can imagine how much sleep I 've gotten
JACK: Yeah , of course , 'cause afte the 5 30 bottle it starts all over again around nine
SYLVIA: And by the time I change he and play with her a little , it 's already eight o'clock
JACK: And then that 's it you get only an hour of sleep .
SYLVIA: And the babysitters till three A.M. all my money is sucked
JACK: Plus they do n't put the kids to ed , they let them lie around half-naked
SYLVIA: Oh , so the flowers and the abbit were from you
JACK: I could have strangled that guy
SYLVIA: I mean it , I ca n't cope anymore . My parents and I do n't talk to each other and anyway they live in Texas , and the baby needs to get out to the park
MICHAEL: Yeah , tell me about it ! Finding time to take her to the park every day is a real bitch !
SYLVIA: And I have to work , I need the money to survive and anyway I love my job
PETER: Of course you 're taking good care of her we know what it 's like , do n't cry , she looks great
SYLVIA: It 's just 'cause I have n't slept in four nights she must be teething or something , I do n't know but I ca n't manage
PETER: Do n't worry , it 's nothing , she 's
MICHAEL: She pulled the same thing on us . We lost all our friends in one night on account of one tooth !
SYLVIA: And just look at my face ! Nobody 's going to want me to model for them with the way my face looks And what 'll happen to me if they do n't want me anymore ?
MICHAEL: But you 're beautiful At you age all you need is a good night 's sleep and you 'll look like new .
SYLVIA: Right , a good night 's sleep ut when ?
PETER: Well , why do n't you leave the aby with us for a few days , till you recuperate I mean , if you want .
MICHAEL: We 're old pros it 's not a ig deal for us
SYLVIA: Really ? I can leave her with you for a little while ?
JACK: Of course . Leave her with us . Come back whenever you want . Get some rest .
SYLVIA: I brought a couple of things for her , just for a few days
SYLVIA: Yeah , it 's time for her bottle it 's all ready in the bag
JACK: I 'll go heat up some water right away . Would you like a cup of coffee ?
SYLVIA: Oh , okay , thanks
MICHAEL: I 'll go make up her bed !
PETER: What ?
MICHAEL: Come see , I said .
JACK: She 'll need two or three months to recover , at least Maybe more !
PETER: We could set up a room for he here
MICHAEL: A room for her and a room fo Mary
JACK: Then we could have four shifts instead of three !
PETER: Yeah , but I do n't think she 'll agree . She 's got her own life to live .
MICHAEL: Yeah , she probably would n't want to move here . She 'd think we 'd jump on her any chance we could
JACK: But we 'd make a rule , she 'd just e 'one of the guys ! '
MICHAEL: She 'll never want to
SYLVIA: So , I 'll take the ten A.M. to three P.M. shift And I 'll take every other night plus the walk in the park in the afternoon before I go to work and we split the ent equally and I 'll just be 'one of the guys ' deal ?
D'ARTAGNAN: Had enough ?
GIRARD: I believe now would be a good time to end your , uhm , formal training . Well done .
D'ARTAGNAN: Thank you , sir .
GIRARD: And god have mercy on whomeve you meet next .
D'ARTAGNAN: Mother ?
D'ARTAGNAN: Did n't you hear me ? Girard
MOTHER: Sit .
D'ARTAGNAN: Father 's sword .
MOTHER: Forged in the Crusades , handed from generation to generation .
D'ARTAGNAN: And now to me .
MOTHER: Yes , son . And now to you .
D'ARTAGNAN: I will .
MOTHER: Never run from a fight
D'ARTAGNAN: I wo n't .
MOTHER: Never submit to insults . Except from the King .
D'ARTAGNAN: Never .
MOTHER: And be wary of Cardinal Richelieu for he rules France through the King .
D'ARTAGNAN: Mother . Maybe I should wait . Until after harvest .
MOTHER: You 've heard that every man in the Musketeers is on the run from someone or something ?
D'ARTAGNAN: Yes . But what am I running from ?
MOGHER: A shrew of a mother , and a drafty old house . Now go .
MOTHER: And for heaven 's sake , practice your horsemanship .
D'ARTAGNAN: Horsemanship . Got it .
JUSSAC: What should I do with this ?
ROCHEFORT: Throw it on the fire with everything else .
JUSSAC: But this is the emblem of the Musketeers
ROCHEFORT: The Musketeers no longer exist . Or have n't you heard ? Throw it on the fire .
ROCHEFORT: Musketeers
DE TREVILLE: And who will protect the King ?
ROCHEFORT: The Cardinal 's Guards are more than capable of assuming that esponsibility .
DE TREVILLE: Musketeers !
ROCHEFORT: Your Eminence .
RICHELIEU: Have they all been accounted for ?
ROCHEFORT: All but three . On Richelieu 's face , a flicker of irritation .
RICHELIEU: Three ?
JUSSAC: I sent a patrol to find them but it has n't returned yet .
RICHELIEU: I want those Musketeers , not excuses . Bring them in at once .
JUSSAC: Release that man ! !
JUSSAC: What is this ? Athos greets him with a dark smile .
ATHOS: A private party . Go away .
ARAMIS: Athos is that any way to greet our guests ?
JUSSAC: Your presence is requested at Musketeer Headquarters by Captain Rochefort . Athos and Aramis exchange looks .
ATHOS: The Cyclops is a Captain ? He must 've made a pact with the Devil .
ARAMIS: Or the Cardinal .
ATHOS: What 's the difference ?
ARAMIS: The Devil is more ethical than the Cardinal .
JUSSAC: You 're instructed to come with me and surrender your tunics .
ATHOS: These gentlemen made a simila equest .
JUSSAC: Are you refusing to come peaceably ?
ATHOS: Probably . But I 'll leave it up to my companions . Aramis ?
ARAMIS: We ca n't refuse Rochefort 's invitation . It would be impolite .
ATHOS: And what do you say , Porthos ?
PORTHOS: I 'll be right down !
PORTHOS: Ready when you are .
ARAMIS: Congratulations , Porthos . You ought down the house .
PORTHOS: My aim was off . I was trying to hit Jussac .
ATHOS: Now . About those tunics
JUSSAC: Musketeers .
CONSTANCE: Do you have any idea what you 've done ?
D'ARTAGNAN: I 've saved you and your friend from these bandits .
CONSTANCE: These 'bandits ' are the Queen 's own bodyguards . D'Artagnan is stunned .
D'ARTAGNAN: The Queen ?
CONSTANCE: If I were you , I 'd make myself scarce . These men are going to be very angry when they wake up .
D'ARTAGNAN: I did n't know . I thought Constance smiles at him , her eyes twinkling .
CONSTANCE: Do you have a name ?
D'ARTAGNAN: D'Artagnan .
CONSTANCE: You 're a very foolish boy , d'Artagnan but a very handsome one . Good-bye .
D'ARTAGNAN: Wait ! You did n't tell me you name ! But Constance is gone .
ROCHEFORT: I 'll take those tunics , Musketeers .
PORTHOS: What did he say ?
ARAMIS: He said he 'll take those tunics .
PORTHOS: Tunics ? Coming right up .
ATHOS: I was trying to remember the last time I saw you here . I know . It was the day you were kicked out of the Musketeers .
ARAMIS: Conduct Unbecoming a Musketeer . Was n't that the charge ?
ROCHEFORT: You ought to know . Three witnesses stood against me .
ATHOS: It was the least we could do .
ROCHEFORT: You are hereby ordered to surrender your commissions and make yourselves available fo eassignment in the King 's Army .
ATHOS: And if we refuse ?
ROCHEFORT: You will become outlaws . Hunted men .
PORTHOS: It does n't matter where I go o what I do . Sooner or late somebody 's calling me 'outlaw . '
ROCHEFORT: Are you refusing to serve you King ?
ARAMIS: We are refusing to serve the Cardinal .
PORTHOS: Same thing , these days .
ARAMIS: France has one King too many .
ROCHEFORT: I 'll tell him you said that .
ATHOS: Do that , Rochefort . Tell his Emminence the Cardinal that we will continue to perform our sworn duty to protect the King . From enemies across the sea .
ROCHEFORT: I 'll make sure His Emminence the Cardinal gets the message . But I ca n't promise he 'll be pleased .
PORTHOS: Well , if we 're going to be outlaws , I suppose we 'll have to get our affairs in order .
ARAMIS: Are you going to visit them alphabetically or in order of preference ?
PORTHOS: Alphabetically seems fair .
ARAMIS: When it comes to you and women , fairness rarely applies .
ATHOS: We 'll meet at the Columbier-Rouge at sundown . To celebrate . And to plan our new lives .
PORTHOS: Outlaws .
ARAMIS: Citizens of France .
ATHOS: The three Musketeers . And that is all that remains .
D'ARTAGNAN: Look out !
ATHOS: Aaarrgghh
D'ARTAGNAN: Where are they ? Where are the Musketeers ? I 'm in the right place , are n't I ?
ATHOS: Not as far as I 'm concerned .
D'ARTAGNAN: But this is Musketee Headquarters
ATHOS: No . This was Musketee Headquarters .
D'ARTAGNAN: You mean it 's been moved ?
ATHOS: I mean the Musketeers have been disbanded . Feel free to poke around for souvenirs .
D'ARTAGNAN: What do you mean 'disbanded ' ?
ATHOS: Some nonsense about being needed in the army . Now if you 'll excuse me D'Artagnan blocks Athos ' path .
D'ARTAGNAN: But I just got here . How can I ecome a Musketeer if they 've been disbanded ?
ATHOS: I 'd say you 've got a problem .
D'ARTAGNAN: Any time .
ATHOS: I 'm in a hurry now but I 'll meet you at the Carmes-Deshaux monastery at noon . Athos exits .
D'ARTAGNAN: I 'll be there ten minutes early .
PORTHOS: But , Catherine , do n't you see ? As an outlaw I 'll be constantly on the run from the Cardinal 's guards , a refugee . Think of all the places you can hide me . I 'm thinking of them now .
PORTHOS: Do you know where this sash comes from ?
D'ARTAGNAN: No .
PORTHOS: It is a gift from the Queen of America .
D'ARTAGNAN: There is no Queen of America .
PORTHOS: Madame Augustine , would you excuse me for a moment , I 'm going to kill him . Now , where were we ?
D'ARTAGNAN: I rode through a puddle , muddied your sash , the Queen of America except there is n't one , I 'm in a hurry , and you were about to challenge me to a duel .
PORTHOS: I was ?
D'ARTAGNAN: That seems to be the local custom .
PORTHOS: Everywhere I go , it 's always the same . There 's always some kid who thinks he 's hot with a sword some itchy punk who wants to go up against the great Porthos
D'ARTAGNAN: The great who ?
PORTHOS: The great Porthos . Me , you idiot . D'Artagnan gives him a blank look .
D'ARTAGNAN: The world 's greatest talker ?
PORTHOS: All right , you little puke ! You want to die ? So be it ! One o'clock behind the Luxembourg ! And bring a coffin !
D'ARTAGNAN: Bring your own !
CARDINAL'S GUARD: I 'm afraid that 's not possible .
D'ARTAGNAN: I must speak to those young women .
CARDINAL'S GUARD: The young women do not wish to be spoken to .
D'ARTAGNAN: I have something that belongs to the Queen .
GUARD: What ?
D'ARTAGNAN: A bracelet .
GUARD: I 'll deliver it for you .
D'ARTAGNAN: No , you 've been enough help already . Would you be so kind as to point out the Carmes-Deshaux Monastery ?
ARAMIS: Madam , I 'm flattered but I thought you wanted me to tutor you in theology .
DAMSEL: Excuse me , Monsieur Aramis . But when you started talking about Original Sin , I lost control and ecame impassioned . It wo n't happen again .
ARAMIS: There 's nothing unholy about expressing one 's emotions . On the contrary . Religion should be experienced in a passionate , all- embracing way . We should feel free to express our spirituality .
DAMSEL: Yes , darling !
ARAMIS: Your husband ! ?
DAMSEL: Aramis run !
ARAMIS: First we must pray to God fo forgiveness .
D'ARTAGNAN: Get off me !
ARAMIS: If there 's one thing I ca n't abide , it 's rudeness .
D'ARTAGNAN: You fell on me !
ARAMIS: And I apologized for it .
D'ARTAGNAN: I suppose you 'd like to teach me a lesson in manners , too .
ARAMIS: I 'd be honored . D'Artagnan brightens . Another duel !
D'ARTAGNAN: How 's two o'clock behind the Luxembourg ? Aramis bows politely .
ARAMIS: If that 's where you wish to die , I wo n't disappoint you . Until then
D'ARTAGNAN: Three duels in one day . I love this town .
ANNE: Cardinal Richelieu , you surprised me .
RICHELIEU: How was your ride ?
ANNE: My ride ? Well , I I 'm not sure
RICHELIEU: Forgive me .
ANNE: Thank you .
RICHELIEU: You 're homesick .
ANNE: Lonely . Is that the same thing ?
RICHELIEU: Sometimes .
ANNE: I 'm not sure my new husband shares your opinion .
RICHELIEU: Nonsense . He 's young , not blind .
ANNE: Mostly , he is absent . I 've barely seen His Majesty since our wedding , and that was three months ago . Whenever he 's around me , he has nothing to say .
RICHELIEU: Arranged marriages can be difficult . Your father and I thought yours would bring Austria and France closer together .
ANNE: Countries align more swiftly than people , I 'm afraid . Louis and I emain far apart .
RICHELIEU: May I advise you ?
ANNE: But how can I ?
RICHELIEU: Flatter him . Make the boy feel like a King . So that the King may be your husband .
SENESCHAL: His Majesty , the King .
RICHELIEU: Your Majesty .
LOUIS: Cardinal Richelieu , I 've been looking for you .
LOUIS: Oh . Anne . Hello . I did n't know you were here .
ANNE: Would you like me to go ?
LOUIS: No . Please , stay . Your Eminence , I demand an answer .
RICHELIEU: Perhaps if I knew the question
LOUIS: I 've just been told that you went ahead and disbanded my Musketeers .
RICHELIEU: You approved the decision .
LOUIS: But not the timing of the matter . I intended to address them myself , explain the situation
RICHELIEU: Your Majesty , France is on the ink of war . We dare not hesitate .
LOUIS: But these men are my personal guards
RICHELIEU: They are the bravest fighters in France .
LOUIS: I will be the judge of what is est . For me , and for France .
RICHELIEU: Of course . Forgive me .
LOUIS: Anne ? Are you all right ?
ANNE: You two should continue this discussion in private .
LOUIS: Your thoughts on the matte interest me . They might help .
ANNE: It seems to me that you 're doing very well on your own .
LOUIS: She 's beautiful .
RICHELIEU: Extremely .
LOUIS: Intelligent .
RICHELIEU: Very .
LOUIS: Sometimes she scares me half to death .
RICHELIEU: May I advise you ?
LOUIS: I have no idea .
RICHELIEU: The course of love is full of frightful turns . But , no matte how you feel , no matter how hopelessly afraid never let her know that you are anything other than the bravest and most confident man in France . Make that your starting point , and everything else will fall into place .
LOUIS: The bravest man in France
RICHELIEU: Good advice for a shopkeeper . Let alone a King .
LOUIS: Your Eminence , I 'm sorry that I was sharp with you . It 's just that the Musketeers well , they 're not just my guards . They 're my friends too .
RICHELIEU: I know . But do n't worry .
ROCHEFORT: He 's a foolish boy . And barely that .
RICHELIEU: That foolish boy is about to ecome a man . Which is all the more reason fo us to act quickly .
ROCHEFORT: And the Queen ?
RICHELIEU: She will receive me in ways she never thought possible . Privately .
ARMAND: But , Father
MILADY: Count de Winter .
ARMAND: Father ?
ATHOS: Ten minutes early .
D'ARTAGNAN: I have another appointment at one .
ATHOS: You 'll miss it , I 'm afraid .
D'ARTAGNAN: I 'll try my best to be on time .
ATHOS: I asked two of my friends to act as seconds , but they are not as punctual .
D'ARTAGNAN: But you 're wounded .
ATHOS: Do n't worry . I fight just as well with my left hand .
D'ARTAGNAN: If you 'd rather kill me anothe time
ATHOS: Thanks , but I see my seconds coming now .
PORTHOS: What 're you doing ? You ca n't fight this man .
ATHOS: Why not ?
PORTHOS: Because I 'm fighting him .
D'ARTAGNAN: Excuse me , monsieur . But not until one o'clock .
ARAMIS: Wait a minute . I 've got a duel with him , too .
D'ARTAGNAN: Yes , sir . But not until two .
ATHOS: How long have you been in Paris ?
D'ARTAGNAN: I arrived this morning .
ATHOS: You 've been busy .
D'ARTAGNAN: I 've also fallen in love .
ATHOS: Better to die for love than to live for it . Gentlemen ?
JUSSAC: There they are ! !
ARAMIS: Jussac . Again . Athos steps forward to meet him .
ATHOS: I told you the next time we met I 'd want an answer . But I did n't expect you so soon .
JUSSAC: The three of you are under arrest . The boy 's of no interest to me and is free to go . Do you intend to resist ?
PORTHOS: Oh , do n't be stupid . Of course we intend to resist . Just give us a second . Porthos huddles with Athos and Aramis .
ARAMIS: It hardly seems fair . Let 's give them the chance to surrender .
D'ARTAGNAN: Excuse me , but there are four of us . They turn and regard d'Artagnan .
ATHOS: This is not your fight . You 're not a Musketeer .
D'ARTAGNAN: I may not wear the uniform , but I elieve I have the heart of a Musketeer .
PORTHOS: Bold and brave .
ARAMIS: A poet .
ATHOS: Have you got a name , boy ?
D'ARTAGNAN: D'Artagnan .
PORTHOS: D'Artagnan ?
ARAMIS: Impossible .
PORTHOS: It could n't be .
ATHOS: Athos Porthos Aramis .
D'ARTAGNAN: Pleased to meet you How do you do ? Good to see you again
PORTHOS: Well . Now that we 're all acquainted
ATHOS: The Cardinal 's Guards .
JUSSAC: Stand still ! How do you expect me to kill you if you keep jumping around ! !
PORTHOS: Damn monks . Always spoiling everybody 's fun .
ARAMIS: They are nearer to God
PORTHOS: They 're about to get a little nearer to the hilt of my sword .
ARAMIS: Pagan .
PORTHOS: Papist .
ARAMIS: I 'm fine , thank you .
ATHOS: You mean he 's still alive ?
BISCARAT: Now what ?
PORTHOS: God , I love my work .
D'ARTAGNAN: What 's he doing ?
ATHOS: Last rites . Aramis takes death very seriously .
PORTHOS: Do you know where this bolo comes from ?
D'ARTAGNAN: The Queen of America ?
PORTHOS: Spain .
ARAMIS: Do n't encourage him . By killing Jussac , the boy 's made himself an outlaw too .
ATHOS: Not if he leaves Paris . Which is exactly what he 's going to do .
D'ARTAGNAN: I ca n't leave . I just got here .
PORTHOS: Go home , find a wench , live long and prosper .
D'ARTAGNAN: Why ca n't I stay with you ?
ATHOS: Because I do not want you to .
ARAMIS: I know Athos may seem cold and unfriendly , but do n't let that fool you .
PORTHOS: He really is cold and unfriendly .
ARAMIS: But he 's also right . This is ou fight , not yours . Go on , get out of here .
D'ARTAGNAN: Whatever happened to the motto of the Musketeers ? 'All for one , and one for all . '
ATHOS: Wake up , boy . The Musketeers are just a dream .
ROCHEFORT: There they go ! After them !
D'ARTAGNAN: Long live the Musketeers . And d'Artagnan draws his saber .
PORTHOS: Do you believe this kid .
ROCHEFORT: Fall back ! I 'll take him myself !
PORTHOS: Rochefort 's got the boy .
ATHOS: Too bad .
ARAMIS: You ca n't just leave him .
PORTHOS: Definitely . A plan . And with that , they gallop after .
GUARD: This boy fights like a wildcat .
D'ARTAGNAN: Thank you .
D'ARTAGNAN: My sword
ROCHEFORT: It 's magnificent . Where did you get it ?
D'ARTAGNAN: It belonged to my father .
ROCHEFORT: Your father
D'ARTAGNAN: I 'm not dead yet .
ROCHEFORT: Soon enough .
D'ARTAGNAN: Where am I ?
ROCHEFORT: I 'll give you a hint . It 's not the Louvre .
D'ARTAGNAN: The Bastille ! I 'm in the Bastille !
ROCHEFORT: Well , you 're the first person who was ever happy to be here . Unfortunately , your visit will be a short one .
D'ARTAGNAN: What do you mean ?
ROCHEFORT: You killed one of the Cardinal 's Guards . An offense punishable y death .
D'ARTAGNAN: He interrupted a duel I was fighting .
ROCHEFORT: Also punishable by death .
D'ARTAGNAN: It was a long day .
ROCHEFORT: You know them ?
D'ARTAGNAN: Who ?
ROCHEFORT: The Musketeers .
D'ARTAGNAN: How ?
ROCHEFORT: I will give you your father 's sword .
D'ARTAGNAN: Give me my father 's sword , and I 'll cut out your heart .
ROCHEFORT: Fool . Like your father .
RICHELIEU: I have an errand that requires your singular talents .
MILADY: I was beginning to think you 'd forgotten me .
RICHELIEU: Forget you ? Impossible .
MILADY: You did it . An alliance with Buckingham .
RICHELIEU: The King left me no choice . Now that he 's come of age , the boy elieves he should rule France . Instead of me .
ROCHEFORT: You 're going to go through with everything ?
RICHELIEU: Yes . Everything . You 're to leave for Calais at once . A ship called the Persephone will carry you to England . It sails Tuesday , midnight . I want Buckingham 's signature next to mine before the King 's birthday . Friday .
MILADY: Consider it done .
RICHELIEU: And doing so , shall earn you the gratitude of a King .
ROCHEFORT: On your knees .
D'ARTAGNAN: I can explain that
ROCHEFORT: Silence !
RICHELIEU: Rochefort . Violence solves nothing . Leave him to me .
D'ARTAGNAN: Not a word , Your Eminence . I stepped from my cell for a breath of air , and became lost in the corridors , it 's dark as you know , ut then I saw a light up ahead , the light over your door , I
RICHELIEU: You may have many talents , my young friend . But guile is not one of them . Do you have a name ?
D'ARTAGNAN: D'Artagnan .
RICHELIEU: I 've heard that name before . Are you a Gascon ?
D'ARTAGNAN: Yes , Your Eminence .
RICHELIEU: Tell me . What brought you to Paris . And do n't say ' a horse . '
D'ARTAGNAN: I came to join the King 's Musketeers .
RICHELIEU: Bad timing .
D'ARTAGNAN: So I 've heard .
RICHELIEU: D'Artagnan , I like you . I could use a capable young man like you in my Guards .
D'ARTAGNAN: I 'm honored , Your Eminence , but I do n't think I would be very popular with the other men . Not after today .
RICHELIEU: I suppose not . Your heart is set on being a Musketeer . When I was your age , I too had dreams of joining the Musketeers .
D'ARTAGNAN: You , Your Eminence ?
RICHELIEU: Why not ? Becoming a Musketeer is the fantasy of every young Frenchman . Or should I say it was Like the Knights of the Round Table , the Musketeers have outlived their usefulness . They are a thing of the past . And so have your three friends . Tell me where they are , d'Artagnan , and I will spare your life .
D'ARTAGNAN: I 'm sorry . But I ca n't tell you what I do not know .
RICHELIEU: In that case , give my regards to the headsman .
D'ARTAGNAN: What about my trial ?
RICHELIEU: You 've just had it .
D'ARTAGNAN: Wait
RICHELIEU: Why ? Do you object to losing your head ?
D'ARTAGNAN: Yes . I like it where it is .
RICHELIEU: Then tell me what I want to know , and perhaps you will keep it there a few years longer . Where are the three Musketeers ?
D'ARTAGNAN: I do n't know .
RICHELIEU: And if you did ?
D'ARTAGNAN: I would n't tell you .
RICHELIEU: I admire your courage , young man . You might have made a fine Musketeer after all .
ROCHEFORT: They 'll be dead by dawn .
RICHELIEU: A comforting thought . Good night , d'Artagnan . Enjoy it . Morning comes quickly .
ROCHEFORT: Milady left at midnight . By private coach .
RICHELIEU: A remarkable woman . The most eautiful I 've ever known . And the deadliest . Which would explain my attraction . How is our young daredevil holding up ?
ROCHEFORT: He 's wishing he 'd never heard of the Musketeers .
PRIEST: Fear not , my son
ARAMIS: All for one , and one for all
PORTHOS: Do n't worry , boy . You wo n't feel a thing .
ARAMIS: The good father is all tied up .
ANNE: Barbarism .
CONSTANCE: Men call it justice .
ANNE: Are you surprised ?
CONSTANCE: It 's him .
ATHOS: Gentlemen , your carriage . Compliments of the Cardinal .
CONSTANCE: Yes !
RICHELIEU: My carriage .
ATHOS: Hold on !
PORTHOS: Well , what have we here ?
ARAMIS: Hello .
PORTHOS: Trinkets for the ladies .
ARAMIS: Let 's share .
D'ARTAGNAN: But ?
ARAMIS: Throw the coins , boy . The people are hungry .
D'ARTAGNAN: They 're firing at us !
PORTHOS: Champagne ?
ATHOS: You know I prefer wine .
PORTHOS: Do n't go away .
ATHOS: Turn right at the next street .
D'ARTAGNAN: The next right ?
ATHOS: Turn .
PORTHOS: That 's it . Next time , you drive .
ATHOS: Gentlemen , this is the end of the line . I hope you had a pleasant ide . Unhitch the horses .
D'ARTAGNAN: But the Guards .
ATHOS: Do as I say .
PORTHOS: I 'd give five years of your life just to see the Cardinal 's face !
ARAMIS: Ten !
RICHELIEU: One thousand pistoles on each of their heads , dead or alive . The oy knows our plans . Rochefort reacts with surprise .
D'ARTAGNAN: I have n't eaten in three days . I guess with all the excitement , I forgot .
ARAMIS: Your trip from home has been an eventful one .
D'ARTAGNAN: Three days .
PORTHOS: I heard of a d'Artagnan once . He was a captain in the Musketeers when we were just recruits .
D'ARTAGNAN: He was my father .
ARAMIS: A good man , I 'm told .
PORTHOS: I knew there was something familiar about this boy .
D'ARTAGNAN: He died when I was nine .
ATHOS: D'Artagnan , your father and anothe Musketeer were ambushed and murdered outside the Louvre .
D'ARTAGNAN: This other Musketeer is he still alive ? I 'd like to talk to him . Athos shakes his head . Porthos adds
PORTHOS: You already have . His name is the Count De Rochefort .
ARAMIS: D'Artagnan .
D'ARTAGNAN: I imagined his death a hundred time .
ARAMIS: A man is better measured by his life than by his death . You father was bold , and brave .
D'ARTAGNAN: But you never knew him
ARAMIS: He lives in you .
D'ARTAGNAN: And your father ?
ARAMIS: I was orphaned at a young age . The church took me in .
D'ARTAGNAN: You did n't have one .
ARAMIS: But I did . He was a great man , a leader of the church . And his example inspired me to dedicate my life to God 's service .
D'ARTAGNAN: You were a priest
ARAMIS: I was a fool . This great man , this father , etrayed the church , and turned his back on God . To worship powe and gold .
D'ARTAGNAN: And you became a Musketeer .
ARAMIS: I joined the Musketeers and a strange thing happened . I got my faith back .
D'ARTAGNAN: But who was that man
ARAMIS: All of France knows him . His Eminence , the Cardinal Richelieu . D'Artagnan nearly jumps from his boots .
ROCHEFORT: Your Eminence . The Musketeers have been sighted riding north on the road to Calais .
RICHELIEU: Do n't worry . Thanks to our winged friends , every mercenary and ounty hunter in France will be waiting for them . Is n't modern communication a wonderful thing ?
D'ARTAGNAN: I could n't hear it clearly , I was standing by the door , the voices were low
PORTHOS: Go on .
D'ARTAGNAN: The Cardinal sent someone to England . With a secret treaty .
ARAMIS: What ?
D'ARTAGNAN: He 's made an alliance with a man named , Bucking Buckingham . The Musketeers look at each other with alarm .
PORTHOS: The Duke of Buckingham ?
D'ARTAGNAN: Do you know him ?
ARAMIS: He rules England the way Richelieu ules France . D'ARTAGNANj A ship called the Persephone waits for the Cardinal 's agent at Calais . To take him to England . Tuesday , midnight .
PORTHOS: This messenger and the treaty will prove the Cardinal a traitor . If we can get our hands on them .
D'ARTAGNAN: What are we waiting for , let 's go .
ATHOS: Wait .
D'ARTAGNAN: Yes .
ATHOS: Then he knows we have it too . And he 'll do everything in his powe to stop us .
PORTHOS: But with three men trying , one of us might be able to make it .
D'ARTAGNAN: Four .
MERCENARY: Shoot low . We 'll need thei heads for identification .
FARMER: Thank God for a friendly face . My horse broke loose . Can you help me move these kegs out of the road ? D'Artagnan starts to dismount .
ATHOS: Stay on your horse .
D'ARTAGNAN: He needs our help .
ATHOS: Do n't worry . We 'll help him .
FARMER: Wo n't you step down Musketeers ?
ARAMIS: Gentlemen , I beg you . Please put away your weapons and remove these kegs from the road . We 'd prefe to ride on without having to kill you .
FARMER: You 're threatening us ?
PORTHOS: It 's not a threat , it 's a fact . If you do n't haul those kegs away , you 're dead where you stand .
ATHOS: Mine was taller .
PORTHOS: There 's only one rule , d'Artagnan stay alive . THUNDER RUMBLES and RAINS begins to fall .
INNKEEPER: Good evening .
ATHOS: See to our horses and bring us some food .
INNKEEPER: I 'm sorry but we have little to spare . The Cardinal 's Guards were here today . They helped themselves to our food and then efused to pay .
ARAMIS: In the name of God , I 'm sure .
BARMAID #1: Musketeers !
INNKEEPER: Musketeers in my house ! Gentlemen , put away your swords and come in . Anyone who fights the Cardinal is welcome here . The Musketeers lower their swords .
ARAMIS: I think we 've found a home .
INNKEEPER: We do n't have much but what we have is yours .
PORTHOS: Ladies , you 're in for a treat tonight . Allow me to introduce myself . I 'm the Musketeer they call Porthos .
ARAMIS: It 's hard to believe they have n't heard of the great Porthos .
PORTHOS: Oh , shut up , Aramis . The three Barmaids perk up .
BARMAIDS: Aramis ? Did you say Aramis ?
PORTHOS: I do n't get it . I just do n't get it .
D'ARTAGNAN: Weak weak . Comical clown .
PORTHOS: Very good . And as a Musketeer is never weak , and only rarely a clown , your first kiss must be all the things that you are . Like this
PORTHOS: You may speak first if you like , your name , her name , an endearment or two . But words are usually a waste of time .
ARAMIS: Only if you do n't know which words to say .
BARMAID: Not likely .
ARAMIS: I 'll demonstrate . Please . Sit eside me .
ARAMIS: Shakespeare .
PORTHOS: That 's cheating . The Barmaid on his lap disagrees .
BARMAID: It 's beautiful .
PORTHOS: Come on , d'Artagnan . We have n't got all night .
D'ARTAGNAN: 'Shall I compare thee to a summer 's day ? Thou are move lovely and more tempest , er , more tempered ' Ahh , to hell with it
PORTHOS: The boy 's a natural .
ARAMIS: So little time , so much to learn .
D'ARTAGNAN: Why is he sitting by himself ?
PORTHOS: Athos takes his drinking seriously . Ignore him . He 'll be his usual warm , charming self by morning . Service ! My lap is cold !
D'ARTAGNAN: Come join us .
ATHOS: You fight like a Musketeer . Let 's see if you can drink like one .
D'ARTAGNAN: I 'll drink anything you put in front of me .
ATHOS: Famous last words . What shall we drink to ?
D'ARTAGNAN: Love ?
ATHOS: Love . Would you like to hear a story , d'Artagnan ? A love story ?
D'ARTAGNAN: Yes .
ATHOS: I once knew a man one of the Counts of Berry . My native province . When the good Count was about your age , he fell in love with a visitor from Paris . A eathtaking girl of seventeen . She was more than beautiful , d'Artagnan . She was intoxicating . And this man , the poor idiot , he married her .
D'ARTAGNAN: Is n't that what people do when they fall in love ?
ATHOS: Be quiet and listen . The Count took her to his castle and made her the first lady of the province . They were happy for a time , as happy as a man and a woman can be . Then one day , while iding in the woods , the girl was thrown from her horse , and knocked unconscious . The Count hurried to help her . Her dress was torn .
D'ARTAGNAN: What ?
ATHOS: The fleur d'lis . She 'd been anded
D'ARTAGNAN: He loved her .
ATHOS: He killed her . It seemed like the same thing after a while .
PORTHOS: Aramis play something with some lood in it ! I feel like dancing !
ATHOS: Only if I can lead .
PORTHOS: Aramis ! Athos made a joke !
INNKEEPER: Excuse me , gentlemen .
D'ARTAGNAN: Were we making too much noise ?
INNKEEPER: You told me to wake you at dawn .
ATHOS: Well ?
INNKEEPER: It 's dawn .
PORTHOS: Beautiful morning , eh , d'Artagnan ?
D'ARTAGNAN: My head feels like it 's filled with the King 's marching band . Would you please stop whistling ?
PORTHOS: Whistling ? I 'm not whistling .
D'ARTAGNAN: Well someone is .
PORTHOS: The Barmaid 's kiss left him dizzy .
ARAMIS: I hear it too . It sounds like
ATHOS: A connon ball .
PORTHOS: I hate cannon balls .
ARAMIS: How 's your head now ?
D'ARTAGNAN: I 'm beginning to wish the Cardinal had chopped if off .
ATHOS: Stay with us , and you just might get your wish .
ATHOS: Split in half ! D'Artagnan rides with me ! D'Artagnan nods , thrilled to go with Athos .
ARAMIS: We 'll see you in Calais !
ATHOS: Or hell !
CONSTANCE: But how , your Majesty ? How can you tell if you 're really in love ?
ANNE: Do you think about him all the time ?
CONSTANCE: Yes .
ANNE: And when he 's around , do you knees feel as weak as water ?
CONSTANCE: Yes .
ANNE: And when he looks at you , do you suddenly forget how to breathe ?
CONSTANCE: Yes .
ANNE: Then you 're in love .
CONSTANCE: I am .
ANNE: Who is he ?
CONSTANCE: You 'll never believe it .
ANNE: Of course I will .
CONSTANCE: You wo n't .
ANNE: Who ?
CONSTANCE: The young man who rescued us from the bandit .
ANNE: The young man on the scaffold ?
CONSTANCE: Yes .
ANNE: You 're right . I do n't believe it .
CONSTANCE: Are you in love , Your Majesty ?
ANNE: What an impertinent question .
CONSTANCE: Are you ?
ANNE: My love is a matter of state . It 's complicated . A sad beat . Constance teases
CONSTANCE: Do you think about him all the time ?
ANNE: As Queen , my mind touches on many subjects .
CONSTANCE: Do your knees feel as weak as water ?
ANNE: Never .
CONSTANCE: When he looks at you , do you forget how to breathe ?
ANNE: I hope he will someday . I hope I will too . HOLD ON Anne for a beat .
RICHELIEU: Your Majesty , forgive me .
ANNE: Cardinal .
RICHELIEU: I need your help . And could not in good conscience wait anothe minute .
ANNE: You want my help ?
RICHELIEU: Yes .
ANNE: On what matter ?
RICHELIEU: Your husband .
ANNE: Your King .
RICHELIEU: I am worried about the King 's happiness .
ANNE: What do you mean ?
RICHELIEU: The Huguenot rebellion , occupation in the Antilles and Cayenne . The coming war with France . These are not the usual hobbies of youth .
ANNE: No .
RICHELIEU: And now he wishes to postpone his irthday celebration .
ANNE: Why ?
RICHELIEU: He feels it is not appropriate .
ANNE: It sounds as though he is concerned with more important matters .
RICHELIEU: Which is exactly why we must celebrate . To show the world that the King of France is strong enough to face any enemy on any field . To show France that he is King . He will listen to you . If you will speak .
ANNE: I will speak to him .
RICHELIEU: Of course .
RICHELIEU: I 'm sorry to be late , You Majesty , but I was wrestling with an important matter of state .
LOUIS: Why is it I do n't see any of my Musketeers ?
RICHELIEU: I 'm afraid that 's impossible .
LOUIS: Why ?
RICHELIEU: They have become outlaws . They are terrorizing the countryside , obbing and killing innocent people . Louis ca n't believe it .
LOUIS: There must be some mistake .
RICHELIEU: No mistake . I have reports from the local constables involved .
LOUIS: Musketeers
RICHELIEU: They are better off disbanded .
LOUIS: Your Eminence , I 've been hearing some very troubling rumors about you . Richelieu nods , not the least bit concerned .
RICHELIEU: There are so many to choose from . Is it the one about my alleged alliance with Buckingham ? Let 's see if I remember it correctly . While the English attack from without , I 'll undermine the throne from within depose you and ecome sovereign of France myself . That rumor , Your Majesty ?
LOUIS: It does seem rather farfetched .
RICHELIEU: If there are any doubts of my loyalty , they 'll be put to rest when we appear together at you irthday celebration .
LOUIS: I 've been thinking about that . A irthday celebration when we 're on the brink of war
RICHELIEU: Your subjects are eager to celebrate the birth of their King at a time like this .
LOUIS: I 'm not so eager .
RICHELIEU: I have an idea . Why do n't you discuss the matter with you Queen ?
ARAMIS: My horse will not survive anothe league .
PORTHOS: And you ?
ARAMIS: Ten , twenty at the most .
PORTHOS: Here 's just the thing . A nice , elaxing boat ride .
FERRYMAN: A privilege to carry you on my humble boat
WOMAN: But I only have one . Could n't my child ride free ? She 's so small
FERRYMAN: Two pistoles . A courtly voice intervenes .
ARAMIS: Put away your money , madame . You and your child will cross the iver under our protection . Fo free .
FERRYMAN: Nobody rides for free ! Unde your protection bloody well indeed ! I 'll teach you a thing or two about protection ! Apple- cheeked young fools ! ! Just who do you think you are ! !
ARAMIS: Musketeers .
FERRYMAN: Musketeers ? Well , why did n't you say so ? Of course you 'll ride fo free . I insist on it . This way , pretty madame . My what a lovely little girl
ARAMIS: Porthos !
PORTHOS: What ?
FIRST CAVALIER: You 're those Musketeers everyone 's een looking for .
PORTHOS: Popularity has its price . The First Cavalier smiles , produces a flask .
FIRST CAVALIER: I have some excellent brandy here . Would you gentlemen care to drink a toast with us to the Cardinal ?
PORTHOS: We 'd be happy to .
SECOND CAVALIER: But the only King we recognize is the Cardinal .
ARAMIS: There are those who would call that treason .
FIRST CAVALIER: Happily , no such objections have een raised here .
PORTHOS: All right . I 'll object .
SECOND CAVALIER: I 'm listening .
PORTHOS: Let 's see . You are , by your dress and by your manner , members of a one-lazy class of servile ninnyhammers whose slavish allegiance to His Eminence the Cardinal is as that of a dog who likes nothing bette than to sniff today where he has peed the day before .
ARAMIS: Well said . I 'm impressed . Ninnyhammers .
PORTHOS: I was momentarily inspired .
FIRST CAVALIER: May I reply ?
ARAMIS: By all means .
FIRST CAVALIER: Better to be a dog in the service of a great master , than a beef- witted moron so dazzled by the throne that he does not see the true nature of the foolish boy who wobbles atop it . Which is to say , that most muddy-brained of all men a Musketeer .
PORTHOS: Maybe there 's something about us that just pisses people off . At least I 'd like to think so . It 's too bad we can only kill them once .
PORTHOS: I 've been called a lot of things in my time
ARAMIS: Porthos
PORTHOS: But beef-witted is a little more than I can stand , not to mention unfair
ARAMIS: Porthos
PORTHOS: What ?
ARAMIS: Can you swim ?
PORTHOS: No . My horse can .
ARAMIS: That 'll do .
PORTHOS: But ?
ARAMIS: You go first and I 'll watch you progress .
PORTHOS: No , no . Please . After you .
WOMAN: Thank you . God speed .
ARAMIS: A nice relaxing boat ride
D'ARTAGNAN: Do you think we 've lost them ?
ATHOS: They 'll catch up eventually .
D'ARTAGNAN: My father used to hunt in a forest like this . He promised to take me on my tenth birthday . I do n't know why he picked that year . Something about a boy becoming a man . I 'd lay in bed at night and imagine it , just the two of us . But he died efore I could go with him .
ATHOS: Well . You have your boyhood wish at last . The dark forest . The thrill of the hunt . The nearness of death .
D'ARTAGNAN: I 'd be proud to die for my King .
ATHOS: I just wanted to save you from the life of a Musketeer . You do n't have to go looking for experience , d'Artagnan . It 'll find you soon enough . And when it does it will mark you forever .
D'ARTAGNAN: I ca n't leave you here . Not like this .
ATHOS: Ride to Calais and stop the Cardinal 's agent .
D'ARTAGNAN: Athos I ca n't . Athos points his pistol at d'Artagnan .
ATHOS: Go , or I 'll kill you myself .
D'ARTAGNAN: A duel then .
ATHOS: You 're insane .
D'ARTAGNAN: We never finished the first .
ATHOS: All right . I 'll toss a coin . Tails I stay , heads you remain . Agreed ?
D'ARTAGNAN: But ?
ATHOS: Do n't let us down Musketeer .
D'ARTAGNAN: I 'll never forget you .
ATHOS: Go !
HENRI: It 's a young man . He appears to e injured .
MILADY: Welcome back . Did you dream ?
D'ARTAGNAN: You .
MILADY: Have we met ?
D'ARTAGNAN: I saw you in Paris .
MILADY: This is Calais .
D'ARTAGNAN: Calais ! The ship Tuesday at midnight
MILADY: Filthy . I 'm having them cleaned . Is something wrong ?
D'ARTAGNAN: What day is it ? What time ? !
MILADY: It 's Tuesday , near nine .
D'ARTAGNAN: Nine ? Are you sure ?
MILADY: Quite sure .
D'ARTAGNAN: How did I get here ?
MILADY: I found you in the road . Discarded . Like an unwanted kitten . Do you have a name o shall I make one up for you ?
D'ARTAGNAN: My name is d'Artagnan .
MILADY: D'Artagnan . I like that . I am the Countess de Winter . Milady .
D'ARTAGNAN: Countess ?
MILADY: My husband 's dead .
D'ARTAGNAN: I 'm sorry .
MILADY: I have learned to live with death .
D'ARTAGNAN: Countess , I 'm very grateful fo what you 've done , but I ca n't stay here . I 've got
MILADY: What ?
D'ARTAGNAN: Important business .
MILADY: How mysterious . A handsome young man with 'important business ' in the still of night . Does it involve a young lady ?
D'ARTAGNAN: No .
MILADY: Does it require clothes ?
D'ARTAGNAN: Yes . I need my clothes .
MILADY: They wo n't be ready for at least an hour .
D'ARTAGNAN: An hour ?
MILADY: I told the innkeeper to bring them when they are dry . Until then , I 'm afraid you are my prisoner . Would the prisoner care for a drink ?
D'ARTAGNAN: I am thirsty .
MILADY: Good . Then we will sit by the fire , and eat and drink , and you may impress , perhaps even move me , with the story of how you came to lie unconscious , in the middle of the night , on the road to Calais . I love a good adventure . D'Artagnan hesitates , then steps to her .
RICHELIEU: The wonderful thing about an imaginary opponent is that he is always greatly skilled , and always easily defeated . The pride of victory , without the risk of loss . If only life were like that .
RICHELIEU: Milady has reached Calais .
ROCHEFORT: I told you not to worry about the Musketeers . They are dead by now .
RICHELIEU: Buckingham 's signature will be on the treaty by morning .
ROCHEFORT: The King 's birthday celebration ?
RICHELIEU: Will proceed as planned . Thanks to the kind intercession of Queen Anne . Rochefort steps closer , speaks quietly .
ROCHEFORT: And our plans ?
RICHELIEU: Will proceed as well .
MILADY: You are sad .
D'ARTAGNAN: I was thinking about my friends .
D'ARTAGNAN: The three best friends a man could have . We were separated on ou way to Calais . I 'm afraid I 'll never see them again .
MILADY: What brings you here ?
D'ARTAGNAN: I 'd like to tell you . But I ca n't .
MILADY: 'Important business . '
D'ARTAGNAN: All I can tell you is I 'm on a mission for the King .
MILADY: I 've heard that one before .
D'ARTAGNAN: I 'm serious .
MILADY: You are a young man . And young men are given to exaggeration . However , if you would like to entertain me with a story , I 'm eager to hear it . And please , make it very brave , filled with handsome knights and beautiful ladies . I know , a dragon
D'ARTAGNAN: I came to Calais to stop a spy from sailing to England .
MILADY: A spy ?
D'ARTAGNAN: Yes .
MILADY: I believe you Are n't you afraid ?
D'ARTAGNAN: Musketeers are not afraid of anything .
MILADY: I knew it . I knew you were a Musketeer the moment I saw you .
D'ARTAGNAN: You did ?
MILADY: Of course . But , d'Artagnan , if this spy was to find out you are here , you life could be in grave danger .
D'ARTAGNAN: A Musketeer is not afriad of danger .
MILADY: I 'm dangerous . You 're not afraid of me ?
D'ARTAGNAN: You 're not dangerous .
MILADY: Then what am I ?
D'ARTAGNAN: You 're beautiful .
MILADY: Beauty , danger . They are the same .
D'ARTAGNAN: I 'm sorry
MILADY: You came to Calais to stop a spy from sailing to England .
D'ARTAGNAN: My God
MILADY: Parker ! !
D'ARTAGNAN: You can kill me . But a surprise waits for you in England . That even Buckingham ca n't prevent .
MILADY: What surprise ?
D'ARTAGNAN: That 's one thing I 'll never tell you .
MILADY: D'Artagnan . You are young , vain , and foolish . But I do not know if you are clever .
HENRI: The bodyguards are waiting outside .
MILADY: The back stairs . Hurry !
D'ARTAGNAN: The man at the inn what did he want ?
MILADY: Justice . Honor . Revenge .
D'ARTAGNAN: Why ?
MILADY: He is the brother of my late husband , Lord de Winter . He lames me for de Winter 's death . He thinks I murdered him .
D'ARTAGNAN: Did you murder your husband , Milady ?
MILADY: What do you think ?
D'ARTAGNAN: I think he 's not the first husband you killed . I once knew a man , one of the Counts of Berry . He told me a story of beauty and danger . He was the bravest man I 've eve known . And the saddest .
MILADY: I know
D'ARTAGNAN: My friends are dead .
MILADY: Well . If it 's any consolation , you 'll soon be joining them .
HENRI: We are the Countess de Winter 's party , arrived from Paris . Permission to come aboard .
HENRI: Take us to your captain .
BODYGUARD: What is this ?
BODYGUARDS: Dead ! They 're all dead !
ARAMIS: You look like you 've seen a ghost .
D'ARTAGNAN: Two of them .
PORTHOS: Remind me to tell you the story of horses that could fly above aging waters . A heroic tale of love , death , and Musketeers . Suitable for the general public .
ATHOS: Sorry I 'm late . Did I miss anything ?
D'ARTAGNAN: I thought you were dead .
ATHOS: Keep your mind on the mission , d'Artagnan .
ATHOS: Boy , it 's a miracle you 're still alive fighting like that .
D'ARTAGNAN: What do you mean ?
ATHOS: First , always find your enemy 's weakness . Second , take advantage of it . Watch me .
D'ARTAGNAN: Find the weakness . Take advantage . Got it .
SAILOR: That 's our ship
BOTH SAILORS: Porthos the Pirate ! !
PORTHOS: I told you I was famous .
D'ARTAGNAN: Porthos the Pirate ?
PORTHOS: Privateer . There 's a difference .
D'ARTAGNAN: I love a good sea story . Do tell me sometime .
ATHOS: Did you find the Cardinal 's spy ?
D'ARTAGNAN: Yes .
ATHOS: Did you kill him ?
D'ARTAGNAN: Athos . The spy is a woman .
ATHOS: What ?
MILADY: Athos .
ATHOS: How did you do it , Sabine ? How did you come back from the dead ?
MILADY: A kind gentleman took pity on me .
ATHOS: I did not .
MILADY: No , Count . You were too proud to listen to the truth . I learned the value of lies soon after .
ATHOS: Give me the Cardinal 's treaty .
MILADY: No .
ATHOS: Then I will shoot . Athos cocks the trigger . Milady whispers
MILADY: Be kind . And aim for my heart .
ARMAND: Countess de Winter
ARAMIS: The treaty outlines Richelieu 's plan to forge an alliance with Buckingham .
PORTHOS: What about the King ?
ARAMIS: He is not mentioned directly . But the agreement is contingent on a 'demonstration ' of the Cardinal 's power .
D'ARTAGNAN: A demonstration ? What does that mean ?
ARAMIS: I do n't know .
ATHOS: I know someone who does .
ARMAND: She dies at dawn .
MILADY: Did you come to offer me consolation ?
ATHOS: No . Milady turns , looks up to face him .
MILADY: There was a time when I would 've given my life for a kind word .
ATHOS: I could not give it , Sabine . I was a fool .
MILADY: I have become the nightmare you once thought me to be .
ATHOS: But not before . Not us .
MILADY: No . The memory will keep me company . Athos kneels at her side , near to pleading
ATHOS: Do you know the Cardinal 's plans ?
MILADY: Yes .
ATHOS: Tell me .
MILADY: Will you spare my life ?
ATHOS: I ca n't .
MILADY: Society demands swift justice . I 'll take the secret to my grave .
ATHOS: Sabine . You 'll die for you crimes . Nothing can stop that . But how you leave this world is up to you .
MILADY: What did the world ever do for me ?
EXECUTIONER: I forgive you for your crimes . Die in peace . Athos repeats , whispers
ATHOS: Die in peace . Aramis comes forward , intones
ARAMIS: I am the resurrection and the life , sayeth the Lord . He that elieveth in me , though he were dead , yet shall he live ; and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die
EXECUTIONER: On your knees .
ATHOS: No .
EXECUTIONER: What 's this ?
PORTHOS: Athos
ATHOS: Forgive me , Sabine . Please forgive .
MILADY: I do .
EXECUTIONER: God 's justice be done .
ARAMIS: Amen .
ATHOS: Musketeers .
RICHELIEU: Impressive .
ROCHEFORT: He can do it every time .
RICHELIEU: And he has no qualms about
ROCHEFORT: None . He believes that man should honor no Kings before God .
RICHELIEU: A man of faith . How delightful . Whatever you 're paying him , double it . I want the King 's birthday to e a memorable event . And rehang this painting in my chamber . Just as it is .
CAPTAIN: the aforenamed Musketeers are declared outlaws and are sentenced to death . Any person sheltering or aiding them will be hanged
LOUIS: They look happy .
ANNE: Hungry , more likely .
LOUIS: Still , you were right about the celebration . And when the Cardinal told me how much it meant to you
ANNE: I said nothing .
LOUIS: But ?
ANNE: The Cardinal expressed in confidence how much the celebration would mean to you Both pause to consider the manipulation .
RICHELIEU: I 'm not sure which is sadder to die so young . Or to die a King .
RICHELIEU: Is everything ready ?
ROCHEFORT: Yes , Your Eminence .
RICHELIEU: Are you sure ?
ROCHEFORT: I 'd stake my life on it , You Eminence .
RICHELIEU: Rest assured , Captain . You have .
ATHOS: Look through the surrounding area . We 'll try to reach the King
D'ARTAGNAN: But ?
ATHOS: Go !
ANNE: I do not trust him .
LOUIS: I 'm not sure who to trust .
ANNE: Then we will discover the truth together .
ATHOS: Save the King ! !
RICHELIEU: Your Majesty
LOUIS: Leave us alone . That 's when a loud BOOM rocks the room .
RICHELIEU: Kill him . Kill her , too .
LOUIS: Get behind me .
ATHOS: Greetings , Monsieur Cyclops . Are we interrupting ?
ROCHEFORT: Not for long . Athos and Rochefort lock swords and duel .
CONSTANCE: Look out !
D'ARTAGNAN: This sword belongs to me .
ARAMIS: D'Artagnan . Kill him where he stands .
ROCHEFORT: By all means . Let 's discover if you are as brave a man as you father was . And as foolish .
D'ARTAGNAN: What ?
ROCHEFORT: He died for his King and fo France . But most of all he died on the end of my sword . As will you .
D'ARTAGNAN: This is for you , Father .
ROCHEFORT: One thing 's certain . You 're no Musketeer .
D'ARTAGNAN: Take it back ?
ROCHEFORT: I might have been mistaken .
D'ARTAGNAN: No ! !
RICHELIEU: Your Majesty , that document is an obvious forgery . I am clearly the victim of a conspiracy designed and perpetuated by these three Musketeers .
LOUIS: This is a complicated matter , Your Eminence , affecting both France and the crown
RICHELIEU: You ca n't do this to me . I 'm the Cardinal of France .
LOUIS: And I am its King .
RICHELIEU: Congratulations , Monsieu d'Artagnan . I 'll be keeping an eye on you .
D'ARTAGNAN: Thank you , Your Eminence . I 'll e watching you , too .
LOUIS: Is this the young man who saved my life ? Porthos puts a hand on d'Artagnan 's shoulder .
PORTHOS: His name 's d'Artagnan , Sire .
LOUIS: Approach , d'Artagnan .
D'ARTAGNAN: I have something that belongs to Your Majesty
ANNE: Thank you , d'Artagnan . But the acelet does not belong to me . It belongs to her .
LOUIS: D'Artagnan , I am in your debt . What can I do to repay the courage you 've shown me ? Anything , D'Artagnan . Whatever your heart desires
ATHOS: Majesty , his heart has only one desire . To become a Musketeer .
LOUIS: Then kneel , d'Artagnan .
LOUIS: Rise , d'Artagnan . And join them . Musketeer .
PORTHOS: Do my eyes deceive me ?
ARAMIS: I find it hard to believe myself .
PORTHOS: His lips , unused as they are to such a contortion , twisted and stretched into a smile .
ARAMIS: It was spectacular . And what teeth .
D'ARTAGNAN: I know this is a stupid question . But what exactly does a Musketee do ?
PORTHOS: Truth honor
ARAMIS: And freedom .
PORTHOS: Were n't you listening ?
D'ARTAGNAN: All for one

JEFF: Onaha , it smells delicious . I am starved .
ALAN: So Dad , I saw the mission on TV . It looked dangerous .
JEFF: Saving lives is a dangerous business . But it 's what we do .
ALAN: Do you think the fire was caused by thermal up draughts ? I mean that would explain the
JEFF: Whoa , whoa , whoa , enough shop talk . I want to hear about school .
ALAN: School 's boring . Plus I 've been thinking , maybe I could be home-educated now . That way , I could

ALAN: I ca n't believe it .
FERMAT: We 're so b-b-busted .

FERMAT: Looks like some sort of , gallium-electrolyte compound .
ALAN: We got ta get out of here .
JEFF: You 're damn right you should n't have een in there !
ALAN: But , nothing happened Dad . I had it under control .
JEFF: Under control ? Do you have any idea of the importance of secrecy in ou operation ? You fired up
ALAN: Yeah , I understand . I understand you do n't want me to be a Thunderbird . You do n't want me to
JEFF: I 've heard enough . You 're grounded fo the rest of spring break .
ALAN: But , Dad !
JEFF: Bottom line , Alan . You need to grow up .
ALAN: Then let me . Please !
JEFF: Hey , John . I was just about to turn in . What can I do for you ?
JOHN TRACY: I could sure use a pizza . You know a place that delivers ?
JEFF: 30 minutes or it 's free , right ? Anything else on your mind ?
JOHN: Well , got a forest fire in Vladivostok , a typhoon heading for Singapore . What 's happening on Planet Tracy ?
JEFF: Alan 's home for spring break .
JOHN: Yeah , I thought I could see a storm ewing in your region .
JEFF: Teenagers .
JOHN: Well , we 've all been there . And Dad , you 've done a great job since Mom died .

FERMAT: The neural-net control system ?
BRAINS: It 's great to have you back . I bet you did n't think spring break was going to be this w- w-fun . Watch this .
FERMAT: Dad ? The neural-net control system short circuits .
BRAINS: N-n-n- Almost perfect .
FERMAT: There 's something I want to talk to you about .
BRAINS: Oh . Right . Oh . OK , right . You 're having
FERMAT: N-no ! No . Alan and I found some sort of gallium compound on the nosecone of Thunderbird
FERMAT: That 'd be g-g-g-swell !
MULLION: The island is in sight .
THE HOOD: Transom , I need you .
TRANSOM: Yes , sir . Sir , our cloaking device has evaded their detection
THE HOOD: Mullion .
MULLION: Sir ? Sir , armed and ready . Shall I target the main structure ?
THE HOOD: Why would I want to destroy what will soon be mine ? One of the principle tenets of Eastern
MULLION: This is ridiculous .
THE HOOD: It will be almost impossible to force the Thunderbirds to leave their island . On the othe
TRANSOM: Straightaway , sir . Target acquisition of Thunderbird 5 is locked .

ALAN: The vents . Let 's go ! We have to get a message to my dad . Scene switch to Thunderbird 5
JOHN: I 'm losing all power . Repeat , I 'm losing all power .
JEFF: Hold on , John . We 're coming in . Gordon , prepare for immediate docking .

GORDON: We 're locked on .
JEFF: Nice work
SCOTT: Tunnel hatch secured .
JEFF: Emergency packs boys . Let 's move !
JOHN: Am I glad to see you guys !
JEFF: Easy , you 're hurt . Virgil , take care of your brother . Gordon , give me a damage assessment .

TRANSOM: One-inch steel plate , with sequential titanium locking mechanism .
FERMAT: Watch out for the guards .
ALAN: Get in , get in .
BRAINS: Who-o-o-o- What 's going on ?
THE HOOD: So , this is Mount Olympus . And these are the Thunderbirds . I should have guessed . Jeff
ALAN: Just keep going straight ahead .
TRANSOM: Professor Hackenbacker ? We met at last year 's international conference on

THE HOOD: Activate the control switch , Prof ! Like a puppet on a string ! Brains hand touches the activation pad .
TRANSOM: We have control .
MULLION: Get up .
TRANSOM: Sorry , Professor . Nothing personal .
SCOTT: We got a warning light on our EPS system .
JEFF: Attempt manual override .
SCOTT: No , that 's negative !
ALAN: That 's it .
FERMAT: Okay , this one . Scene switches to Thunderbird 5 .
JEFF: Back to Thunderbird 3 now . John , we got ta move .
GORDON: The locking mechanism 's jammed !
THE HOOD: Attention , Thunderbird 5 . As you can see I have taken over your facilities . You no longe control your operational systems .
ALAN: They 've taken over .
THE HOOD: Warm them up , Transom .
TRANSOM: Increasing temperature to maximum .
ALAN: Who 's the bald freak ?
KYRANO: You ? The Hood uses his powers on him and he falls down clutching his head .
FERMAT: They 've got m-my dad .
JEFF: Okay , you have our attention . Who are you ? What do you want ?
THE HOOD: Oh how rude of me . You can call me The Hood . Now , listen , Mr. Tracy . We wo n't
SCOTT: You 'll never get away with it .
JEFF: Why the Thunderbirds ?
THE HOOD: An eye for an eye , Mr. Tracy .
JEFF: An eye for an eye ?
THE HOOD: Perhaps you 've forgotten me , but surely you remember saving the life of my brother , Kyrano ?
KYRANO: Turns to the video phone that the Hood

VIRGIL: How long will that give us ?
JOHN: About four hours .
MULLION: Someone 's there . ( Mullion walks ove to the ceiling , he is standing directly elow where
ALAN: No , jump ! We can get through to the silos .
THE HOOD: Apparently , the island is not as secure as you thought . ( he looks at the old photos that were
TRANSOM: Here they are . Thunderbird 2 silo , in the loading arm .
THE HOOD: Seal them in .
ALAN: Hold on !
FERMAT: Go ! Go !
ALAN: This way .
FERMAT: No !
ALAN: I 'll use the Thunderizer on the door .
FERMAT: Alan ! This equipment is only to be used in an emergency . I guess this qualifies .
ALAN: Yeah .
FERMAT: Uh , no .
MULLION: Retreat !
ALAN: That 's it . Time to thunderize . Yes !
MULLION: Get 'em !
ALAN: Where 's Fermat ?
FERMAT: Coming !
FERMAT: I had an-n-n idea .
ALAN: Just try and keep up , okay ? I 'll open the tunnel . We got ta keep moving .
THE HOOD: Alan . You can run if you want . Were you surprised to hear what your fathe did to me ? It is
ALAN: We ca n't go this way . He 's there .
FERMAT: No ! Ow . What are we gon na do , Alan ?
ALAN: I do n't know . I 'm thinking , okay ? ( Alan looks at the control panel behind the Hood and sees a
THE HOOD: It 's not me you 're angry at , Alan .
ALAN: It 's not you I 'm aiming at . ( Alan fires another rock and this time hits the utton and the floo
THE HOOD: Get them !
MULLION: Transom , fire up Thunderbird 1 . And set it on broil !
TRANSOM: No sign of them .
MULLION: Of course not , the little brats went up like firecrackers . Pop , pop , pop !
THE HOOD: Do n't , give him the satisfaction , Professor . This is taking too long . Pick out the equipment
MULLION: Yes , sir .
FERMAT: How about a little warning next time you pull a stunt like that ?
ALAN: Relax , Fermat . It 's just a little water .
FERMAT: I could have drowned .
ALAN: You mean you ca n't swim ? !
FERMAT: I repeat , I could have drowned .
ALAN: I said I was sorry , Fermat . Just put this behind us , Okay ? We got ta watch each other 's backs . Nice drawers .
FERMAT: Thank you .
ALAN: No , c'mon Tintin , stay there .
FERMAT: Data from Tracy Island is sent to Thunderbird 5 via satellite , right ?
ALAN: Right .
FERMAT: So , there 's a miniscule possibility that if we reach the satellite station , we could
ALAN: Blow it up !
FERMAT: No , we could hack in to it and give control back to Thunderbird 5 .
ALAN: Good thinking , Fermat . Alright , let 's do it . Here 's the
FERMAT: But that 's f-f- off limits .
ALAN: I 'm in . We got ta get up there fast ! All our folks are

LADY PENELOPE: Parker ?
PARKER: Milady ?
LADY PENELOPE: We have an emergency . Scene switch to Lady Penelope 's bathroom
PARKER: Sounds like an alias , milady .
LADY PENELOPE: Quite right , Parker . Real name Trangh Belagant . Assumed dead when
PARKER: Milady , that 's Mr. Tracy 's loyal manservant , Kyrano .
LADY PENELOPE: How 's my schedule , Parker ?
PARKER: You have clay pigeon shooting with Lord Marlborough , a benefit gala for the Institute of the
LADY PENELOPE: I suppose that 's urgent .
PARKER: Yes , milady . There was also a bridge collapsed in Buenos Aires and a volcanic eruption in Jakarta .
LADY PENELOPE: The Thunderbirds have n't responded ?
PARKER: No , milady . And the media is awash in speculation vis-à-vis their whereabouts . Parker turns on the news .
CHUCK: Over to Lisa Lowe .
LISA LOWE: Chuck , disaster after disaster around the world today and still no sight of the Thunderbirds .
LADY PENELOPE: I think it 's time to send the emergency signal , Parker .
PARKER: I fear you 're not wrong , milady .
LISA LOWE: Lisa Lowe . Back to you , Chuck .
ALAN: I 'm telling you , Fermat , it was like The Hood was inside my head back there .
FERMAT: What do you mean , Alan ?
ALAN: Maybe he can read minds or control minds or something .
FERMAT: Do n't be silly , Alan . Everything can e explained by science .
ALAN: I 'm just trying to figure out his weakness . Everybody has an Achilles heel , right ?
FERMAT: My Achilles heel is actually my Achilles heel . It 's got a blister the size of a basketball . Tintin ! Can we s-s-
ALAN: No more cheeseburgers for you , Fermat . Scene change back to Lady Penelope 's house .
LADY PENELOPE: Any word ?
PARKER: Nothing , milady .
LADY PENELOPE: Right . You will have to tell Lord Marlborough that I 've broken my shooting arm . We
PARKER: Yes , milady .
LADY PENELOPE: The Thunderbirds appear to be in a spot of trouble . And I do n't like that . Let 's go , Parker .
MULLION: Ready for launch . We 'll use this to get into the vaults .
THE HOOD: Subtle , as usual , Mullion .
MULLION: I did n't realize we 'd be getting points for style . We 're robbing banks , remember .
THE HOOD: Do n't worry . You 'll get your money .
MULLION: Transom , initiate pre-flight diagnostics . An alarm suddenly goes off in Thunderbird 2 .
TRANSOM: It 's the guidance processor .
MULLION: What 's wrong with it ?
TRANSOM: There is n't one .
MULLION: Aaargh !
THE HOOD: Clever Alan . It 's the children . They have it .
MULLION: No way . They 're dead . No one could live through something like that .
THE HOOD: I did . Get them , Mullion . Take whateve you need . And make sure you get the guidance processor before you lose your temper . Scene switches to the children in the jungle .
FERMAT: Alan , do n't you think Tintin is blossoming ?
ALAN: Blossoming ? ! What 's that supposed to mean ?
FERMAT: Come on , Alan . You 've a c-crush on her .
ALAN: You 've got to be kidding . I mean , she 's . She 's not that bad , I guess .
ALAN: What is it ?
FERMAT: .025 milligrams of its venom is fatal .
ALAN: So , dangerous is in fact an understatement .
FERMAT: Watch out !
ALAN: Tintin , what was that ?
FERMAT: You think ?
ALAN: Must run in the family . Did you do that ?
FERMAT: Not girls !
JEFF: Scott ? Gordon ? You all right ?
GORDON: We 're okay .
SCOTT: The heat exchanger has blown .
JEFF: You do n't say .
MULLION: Come on ! Those brats are in here somewhere .
ALAN: How we doing Fermat ?
FERMAT: Do n't rush me Alan . This is very d-delicate equipment . Which is now b-b-broken .
ALAN: Can you fix it ?
FERMAT: Yea- Maybe , but I 'll need something to solder with .
ALAN: We 're in the middle of nowhere Fermat , where are you going to find something like that . ( Tintin
FERMAT: Perfect .
ALAN: I 'm gon na kill you .
FERMAT: What 'd he say ?
ALAN: Dad ?
JOHN: It 's Alan !
JEFF: Alan , where are you ? Are you safe ?
ALAN: I 'm at the satellite relay station with Fermat and Tintin . Fermat 's gon na hack into the main
JEFF: We 're standing by .
FERMAT: Okay , we 're almost there .
THE HOOD: And give Mullion the coordinates .
TRANSOM: Take the main track southeast , then head up Satellite Hill .
FERMAT: They 're onto us ! We 're being jammed !
ALAN: Can you finish ?
FERMAT: I 'll try .
JEFF: Alan , what 's happening ?
ALAN: Hang in there Dad , one more minute , okay ?
FERMAT: It 's not going to work Alan . The signal 's too weak for data transmission .
ALAN: Dad , can you hear me ? They 're jamming the signal . We 're going to lose you . Do n't worry , I 'll take care of everything , okay ?
JEFF: That 's a negative ! It 's too dangerous . Follow emergency procedure . Wait fo Lady Penelope at the
ALAN: Dad !
JEFF: Alan we 're losing you ! Alan !
ALAN: Dad ! Alan throws the video phone
FERMAT: No !
ALAN: Useless !
FERMAT: It is now .
ALAN: No , it 's okay . I 'm fine .
FERMAT: You do n't have to be such a tough guy Alan . I 'm worried about my dad too .
ALAN: But The Hood knows we 're alive now . We have to go .
FERMAT: Even worse , they know exactly
MULLION: Come on !
FERMAT: Great , more water .
ALAN: Tintin , can you slow 'em down ?
MULLION: There ! Come on ! Tintin looks up and sees a bees hive .
FERMAT: It 's gon na make this thing hard to control you know .
ALAN: No problem .
FERMAT: You really must be careful not to exceed four bars of boost or else
ALAN: I said no problem .
FERMAT: It 's a hoversled .
ALAN: It 's our ticket out , unless you 've got a better idea .
FERMAT: Here .
ALAN: Great plan . Let 's sit and wait to get caught . I say we do something . Now ! Right , Fermat ?
FERMAT: Actually , I agree with Tintin . I do n't think this is s-s-safe .
ALAN: You do n't think anything is s s-safe .
FERMAT: Just because I s-s-stutter does n't mean that I 'm wrong . If we 're a team , we should make decisions as a team .
ALAN: Do you guys want to sit here and take a vote ? Or do you want to get out of here ? Cuz I 'm going .
MULLION: Go ! Go !
FERMAT: Alan ! You 're going too fast !
ALAN: I need more speed to get above the trees . Hang on !
FERMAT: Oh , no ! Not the fridge !

JEFF: No , it 's not . There 's still time . We 've got people on the ground working fo us .
GORDON: Alan ? He 's just a kid !
JEFF: He 's a Tracy .
LADY PENELOPE: This does n't look good , Parker .
PARKER: No , milady .
LADY PENELOPE: That bougainvillea is absolutely parched , and someone should do something about that hideous hammock .
THE HOOD: Whom do we have here ? Mullion .
MULLION: I must warn you that I know judo , krai magna , and tae kwon do .
LADY PENELOPE: And I know Parker .
PARKER: Milady .
MULLION: You 've broken my nose .
PARKER: Yes , that was very much the intention of the maneuver .
TRANSOM: Whoa !
LADY PENELOPE: One tries so hard in life to sort things out on an intellectual-slash-conversational level . sometimes it 's just not possible .
PARKER: Shall I bring the car around , milady ?
LADY PENELOPE: Parker , have a bit of a lie-down .

THE HOOD: You 're formidable opponent Lady Penelope . More than a match for most men .
LADY PENELOPE: That 's not saying much , then , is it ?
THE HOOD: I suggest you let us pass .

BUSTED: Thunderbirds Are Go
CARL: Hey .
RAY: Hey . Nice tie .
CARL: Do n't get too attached .
RAY: Ya got the paper ? They mount steps .
CARL: Yeah .
RAY: You 're my hero , Carl .
CARL: Heroes ai n't supposed to shake . I 'm shakin ' , man , look at me .
RAY: Breathe , Carl . Four , nice , deep ones .
CARL: Rug samples .
RAY: We are one-dimensional , boring peddlers of fine carpet , Carl .
BLACK MAN: Hey , look who 's here .
RAY: Louis , my man , what 's happenin ' ?
FENCE MAN: Clean ones ?
RAY: Immaculate .
FENCE MAN: What ya got there , seventy-five thousand ?
CARL: A hundred and ten . Count it .
FENCE MAN: SALLLLY !
LOUIS: F.B.I. ! Get your face on the fuckin ' floor ! MOVE !
RAY: Slam dunk .
LOUIS: Beauty . Beauty
CARL: Jesus Christ , Larry , what the fu Larry . That 's not even your name , is it ? What 's your real name , you fucking scumbag ?
RAY: Do n't have one , Carl . I have a number , man . Just like the numbers on those treasury checks . You stole from you own country , Carl . Shame on you .
LOUIS: Sugar Ray .
CARL: We just spent four months together I thought he was my friend what the fuck , man ? He had dinner at my mother 's .
TULLY: Please .
RAY: Mister Tully .
TULLY: Do you want a coffee ?
RAY: No . No , no . Thank you .
TULLY: Levoi , Cooch . Raymond Levoi , Criminal Division .
COOCH: Oh , yeah right .
TULLY: Ray this is
COUTURE: Hello , Ray .
RAY: It 's an honor .
TULLY: Ray , we 're taking you off the street . We need you out in South Dakota . Ray 's enthusiasm suddenly deflates .
RAY: South Dakota Did I do something unsatisfactory , Sir ?
COOCH: No , Ray . You 're gon na have to blame that on your grandmother .
TULLY: Interesting bloodline you have , Ray . French , Scots-Irish , Italian , and one-eighth American Indian .
COOCH: Sioux Indian , right ?
RAY: I 'm not that sure . Yeah , I think
TULLY: yes , Teton Sioux . Father 's side .
COOCH: It 's not the first . There 's been several . And our field office in Rapid City is getting a lot of heat none of the investigations have turned up jack shit .
TULLY: The main problem is , Ray , these people are extremely distrustful of outsiders , non-Indians . Relations have not been amicable .
COOCH: Different culture . Hard to penetrate . The Indians do n't like white cops poking around . And that 's why we 're in a position where we have to bring in an American Indian agent .
TULLY: With an Indian representative out there , we hope to keep hostilities dormant ; this is a COINTELPRO , Selective Operations Unit , and it 'll e easier on Agent Couture if you can gain the people 's trust and maybe
RAY: Woh , excuse me , Sir I see what you 're saying I 've got a little Indian blood , that 's true . But I am not an an Indian . I ca n't just go in and
TULLY: your father was part Sioux . A beat . Ray lowers his eyes to the photos .
RAY: I did n't know him , Sir . He passed away when I was six .
COOCH: Seven .
RAY: Eight murders in less than a year . All of them Indian . All of them unsolved . Is the law a non-entity out here or what ?
COOCH: Those are two agents who went into a eservation a few years ago to serve a warrant . They were executed at close range . That one there is a police officer killed by the Mohawks up in Canada more recently .
RAY: Jesus
COOCH: The agents who have worked out here say its like going into Nam . Unfamiliar terrain , foreign language , foreign customs and you neve know when you might walk into a few ounds . They hold a lot of old ange for the white man out here .
RAY: Were you in Nam ?
COOCH: Airborne . That 's where they used to get us agents from . Now we get 'em from Carnegie-Melon , Ivy League . Accountants and computer whiz-kids . Yuppies with guns . That 's scary shit . Ray smiles , sets the AC on high .
RAY: Not as scary as a Hoover man with a computer .
COOCH: Hey , hey , hey . J. Edgar would 've loved you . He 'd love anybody who joined the bureau to , what was it ? `` To enforce the laws of my country and protect her interests '' ?
RAY: You crashed my file ?
COOCH: No . I consulted it . We 're going into Indian Country , I wan na know what kind of individual is covering my ass . Do n't you ?
RAY: You 've been in the bureau for thirty years . You survived The Hoov , the Black Panthers and Abscam . I do n't see any bullet holes . That 's good enough for me .
COOCH: Who found him ?
MILES: Indian kids . Hunting fossils .
COOCH: Okay . I think Agent Levoi and I can proceed from here . What are you call signals ?
SHERMAN: PX-10 and 11 . Anything we can do to help you out , just radio .
COOCH: Good . Thanks , Guys .
RAY: Leo Fast Elk Thirty seven single Member of the Tribal Council .
COOCH: Looks like Fast Elk was n't fast enough to outrun that load . What do you make of the damage ?
RAY: Six rounds . 357 .
COOCH: That 's what it looks like , does n't it ? But that 's what a ten gauge , choke-bored , shotgun will look like when it hits your lower back from five feet away .
RAY: Somebody was serious about doing this guy , that 's for sure .
COOCH: Ray .
CROW HORSE: Leo 's been out here too long , man . I 'm taking him to ceremonial burial .
RAY: This is a restricted area .
COOCH: Check him out , Ray .
CROW HORSE: It ai n't Geronimo .
COOCH: Who are you ?
CROW HORSE: I think maybe you guys got off the wrong exit , yeah ? This is the Bea Creek Indian Reservation .
COOCH: I know where I am . I 'm on federal land , doing a federal investigation , and if you do n't wan na cooperate you can take a ride in a federal car , and spend the rest of the day in a little room , answering federal questions . It 's your call . Who are you ?
CROW HORSE: I 'm a full blood Oglala Sioux , born and raised on this reservation .
COOCH: You 're a wise-ass . Ray check his wallet .
RAY: I did .
COOCH: Who the fuck is he ?
RAY: a fucking cop .
COOCH: He 's a fucking cop .
CROW HORSE: We got the wire ya was comin ' . You 're the Indian official , yeah ?
COOCH: No . No , that 's Ray , here . Ray , uh Ray Little Weasel .
CROW HORSE: Leo 's got ta get to burial , Brother . He 's got ta make the journey .
COOCH: What journey ?
CROW HORSE: Tell him , Ray .
RAY: Leo has to take the journey , Cooch .
COOCH: We 'll have to give Leo a refund . Because he 's got ta go to the M.E . In case you do n't know , Officer , violation of the Major Crimes Act on
CROW HORSE: an Indian Reservation is within the jurisdiction of the Federal Bureau of Intimidation . I know that .
COOCH: Good . Thank you .
CROW HORSE: I said when can Leo be taken to ceremony ?
RAY: After we 've completed ou investigation . Crow Horse is staring at Ray .
CROW HORSE: That 's a nice suit .
COOCH: Somebody must be doing something somewhere in your jurisdiction , Officer Crow Foot .
CROW HORSE: You ai n't gon na cut his hands off and send 'em to Washinton , are ya ? They done that to one of our girls once . Leo did quillwork , he 's gon na need his hands .
RAY: Leo 's gon na need his hands , Cooch . He does quillwork .
COOCH: I think Leo 's retired from quillwork for the moment .
CROW HORSE: Respect the dead , Hoss . Because when
COOCH: did you understand me when I said that
CROW HORSE: violation of the Major Crimes Act on an Indian Reservation is within the jurisdiction of the Federal Bureau of Instigation . I know that .
COOCH: Goodbye .
CROW HORSE: His mother needs a piece of his hair . It 's for the Keeping of the Souls Ceremony . Has to be kept for four days .
COOCH: Keeping of the souls . Do they still urn their dead or something ?
RAY: Beats the hell outta me .
COOCH: Sorry , Ray . You 're gon na have to wait in the car . I 'll bring you out a cheeseburger .
CLEAR MOON: You made it . Was-te .
COOCH: You must be President Clear Bone .
CLEAR MOON: Clear Moon . Moon . You must be the Sioux .
COOCH: No . That 's Ray here . Ray
RAY: Ray Levoi , Sir . Pleasure .
CLEAR MOON: It 's about time they sent us one of our own . Was-te .
RAY: I thought we were staying on the eservation .
CLEAR MOON: Yes . Rooms thirteen and fourteen are on Indian land .
RAY: I see .
CLEAR MOON: Are you hungry ? I have some nice raw kidney in the truck .
RAY: Oh , I 'm set , Sir . I 'm set .
COOCH: He 's starving , Mr. Clear Moon . Get him some raw kidney . He has n't had any Indian food in days
WHITE LOCAL: Where you goin ' ? Back to the res ?
COOCH: Let 's take a walk . Ray is transfixed .
DENNIS: So what type of salesmen are you gentlemen anyway ?
RAY: Liquor . We heard they like thei drink on the reservation , and we were gon na see if we could n't unload some surplus on the way to Nebraska .
COOCH: Now keep that between us , Dennis , cuz I do n't know what kinda Johnny Law they got here .
DENNIS: Hey , Brooks , come over here . I want you to meet a coupla fellas from Denver .
BROOKS: They ai n't liquor salesmen . They 're
COOCH: Brooks , what 's a perceptive fellow like you , doing in a joint like this ? Let me buy you a glass of some of that Russian shit you like .
DENNIS: FBI ? What you investigatin ' ?
COOCH: A murder . On the reservation .
DENNIS: Again . Figures , man .
BROOKS: You 'll never find out who did it .
COOCH: You underestimate me , Brooks .
BROOKS: No . You underestimate these grass niggers . They 're killing each other . That 's all they do . Get drunk and kill each other . Then cover for each other . Who gives a damn really as long as they stay on thei eservation . You ask me , the government should n't care one particle .
DENNIS: You know how in your big cities , you got your niggers and you got you Puerto Ricans ? Well out here we got Indians . That 's just the way it is .
COOCH: The only good Indian is a dead Indian , does that old adage still hold true out here ?
BROOKS: That set-to you saw out front , was nothin ' more than a message we were sendin ' to the sonsabitches that are divertin ' water from the river .
DENNIS: We got rights . We got a ranch just up here .
RAY: Did any of you gentlemen know Leo Fast Elk ? Both men shake their heads . Get quiet .
BROOKS: You fellas are here to investigate a Indian crime , you should keep to Indian land , and talk to them , not us . But you wan na drink here and shoot stick here , that 's your right , and we respect that . Come on , Son , we 're up on the table .
DENNIS: You fellas wan na play doubles ?
RAY: Water . Worth killing for out here , I 'd think .
COOCH: Get the plate numbers off everyone of these cars .
RAY: I already did . Cooch looks at Ray , impressed .
COOCH: Good .

CROW HORSE: You 're steppin ' on sign .
RAY: Hey . Hey , you , listen up
CROW HORSE: Leo was n't killed here . He was dumped here . Out of a vehicle . Bald tread . Muffler held on with baling wire . Crow Horse checks out another track .
RAY: Bullshit .

CROW HORSE: No . Not just a track . You got ta listen to the trees , man . To the leaves . To this sand , you FBI 's kicked all up . You got ta listen to the earth .
RAY: Is that right ? Well , listen to this drag your ass . This is a restricted area .
CROW HORSE: No , this is the home of the Oglala Sioux and I want the dog-fucker who killed Leo . Whether you get him or I get him , I just want him . Shit 's een goin ' on too long .
RAY: You 've got no jurisdiction .
CROW HORSE: You got no know-how . About Indian Way . Or about Jack Shit for that matter .
RAY: Maybe you 're not aware of this , Crow Horse , but I just flew in from a place called the Twentieth Century where we have such things as electrostatic tracking methods , psycholingusitics , DNA fingerprinting ; I do n't have to crawl around with the scorpions and talk to the fucking trees to get answers . Leo was killed ight here .
CROW HORSE: Go back to the M.E. , take a look inside Leo 's exit wounds and tell me how chicken feed got in there . Trust me , there ai n't chickens in the Badlands . His mother 's place is

RAY: White eagle feather through the circle . That 's their symbol .
COOCH: That 's right .
RAY: They obviously wanted it to be known that they offed Leo . Some kind of statement .
COOCH: Jimmy Looks Twice put Leo 's head through a glass door of the tribal offices three months ago . And threatened him several times since . President Clear Moon and the regional FBI feel he made good on that threat .
RAY: I 'd just like five minutes alone with the motherfucker who hung that flag upside down .

RAY: He knows me ?
CROW HORSE: He says he saw you in a vision some time ago .
RAY: What 's he smoke in that ?
CROW HORSE: Sacred herbs . Tobacco . Do n't worry , we do n't smoke no Mexican agriculture in The Pipe . That 's a white man 's myth . This is a sacrament . The old man is offering the pipe to Ray .
GRANDPA: Mltaku Oyasin .
CROW HORSE: You do n't smoke with him , it means you 're hiding something .
RAY: Tell him I 'm trying to find the man who murdered Leo Fast Elk . Ask him if he knows where he is .
CROW HORSE: He said he does n't know .
RAY: He just did the Gettysburg Address in Sioux . What did he say ?
CROW HORSE: Uh Grandpa likes to trade ; no one stops by here without gettin ' stuck in the old Indian barter . He , uh he likes your shades .
RAY: What was he saying ?
CROW HORSE: Why should I tell you .
RAY: Because he was talking to me . Crow Horse keeps walking .
CROW HORSE: The old man saw an owl . Over there in the dry wash. Last week .
RAY: And
CROW HORSE: He saw an owl .
RAY: So what ?
CROW HORSE: The owl is a messenger . When one shows itself to a Sioux it means someone 's gon na die . The owl told him about Leo . Ray stares vacantly .
RAY: The owl told him about Leo . That 's incredible . I guess we just broke the back of this investigation , did n't we ? Evidence does n't get any harde than that not for my money . Is there anyway we can seduce this owl into Federal Court ?
CROW HORSE: He also said `` listen to the water . ''
RAY: Listen to the water . Listen to the owl . He also said , do n't trust the fucking Cookie Monster .
CROW HORSE: Go back to your DNA finger-printin ' .
CALLER: Was-te Yelo ! Let 's have five more veterans . Five more veterans . Hoka Hey !
CHASING HAWK: What is that that you honor there , uncles ? After all the Wasi'cu country has done to you , after all he still does to you , you honor that flag ? ! That flag has been desecrated by the United States , because they have not honored what that flag represents !
MILES: Okay . Here we go .
COOCH: Who 's this guy ?
SHERMAN: Anderson Chasing Hawk . Second in command behind Jimmy .
MILES: She keeps an AR-15 assault rifle in her truck . And she 'll use it .
RAY: Mr. Clear Moon .
CLEAR MOON: Our police are afraid of them . Please get them out of here .
RAY: They can lead us to Jimmy . Just let them go . We 're tightening the net on him . We know he 's on the reservation .
CLEAR MOON: Help us .
AGENT SHERMAN: Where 's Jimmy ? We thought he 'd be dancing today .
YELLOW BIRD: Are you the Washington Redskin ?
AGENT MILES: Say hello to Richard Yellow Bird , Ray .
COOCH: Ray , get to Jimmy 's place and keep it tight . I 'm gon na get a tail on his Warriors .
RAY: X22 . Read .
RADIO: Go ahead , Ray .
RAY: I have a pick-up truck . No plates . Subject Indian entering suspect 's house . Over .
RADIO: Okay , Ray . I 'm coming in . If he starts to leave the area , move in . And hold him . Over .
RAY: FBI , freeze , Motherfucker drop it , drop it !
MAGGIE: You 're the Indian FBI .
RAY: That 's right . Turn around .
MAGGIE: The people are glad they sent you . They usually send in guys who come at ya with highbeams , screamin ' `` drop it , Motherfucker '' , stick a gun in your face , frisk ya down . Even if ya got a child with ya . No , it 's good to have ya . It 's gon na be was-te times on the res .
RAY: This Jimmy 's ?
MAGGIE: You 're not gon na catch him . He can shape-shift into different animals . Bear . Elk . Porcupine .
RAY: Is that like an hereditary thing , Magdelana , or can one take classes ?
MAGGIE: Jimmy did n't kill Leo . Why do you wan na do this ?
RAY: He tried to kill him twice before . That 's a good place to start do n't ya think ? Leo was on the other side , was n't he ?
MAGGIE: Leo was an apple , that 's right . Red on the outside , white on the inside . And Jimmy hated him . Kicked his ass a coupla times . But he did n't kill him .
RAY: Who did ?
MAGGIE: You 're the FBI . That 's your job , is n't it ? Ya know how many of ou Warrior brothers got killed out here ? I never saw any investigating then . Why now ? What 's going down here ?
RAY: A Fugitive Alert for a murder suspect . Before somebody else gets a shotgun last in the spine .
MAGGIE: Try the Fort Laramie Treaty . All over again .
RAY: Look . You and I can stand here in a culture clash til the sun comes up , talking about what 's right and what 's wrong . You 're from the reservation . It 's a different world .
MAGGIE: I 'm from Minneapolis . Fifth Street . I did four years at Dartmouth before I ever set foot on this res . So I know about the other world , Ray .
RAY: When you see Jimmy , tell him the sooner he turns himself back into a human being and gives himself in the sooner we back off this eservation . Okay ?
MAGGIE: Grandpa Reaches says you come from heavy Indian blood . I used to think Grandpa was gettin ' senile . Now I know he is .
RAY: Move it , Magdelana .
COOCH: Ray , you alright ?
AGENT SHERMAN: What do we got , Ray ?
RAY: It was just Eagle Bear . I questioned and released her .
COOCH: What 'd she say ?
RAY: She talks a lot of shit . We 're not doing our job . Jimmy 's innocent . `` What 's the FBI really doing here . '' Some shit about the Fort Laramie Treaty .
COOCH: Let 's see it .
RAY: I gave it back to her .
AGENT SHERMAN: Why ?
RAY: If it is Jimmy 's , she 's taking it to him . We 'll have a runner . But I orrowed a little mojo
COOCH: Way to go , Raymond . Miles , take that to lab . Sherman , I want you to go ack to base and produce some written material . Something that indicates that our girl Maggie is leaking information to us . And make sure that material finds its way into the hands of the Warrior Movement .
RAY: Why we setting Eagle Bear up as an informant ?
COOCH: Her own people start to suspect her , it creates discord from within . The Warriors do n't know who to trust , they start infighting , and Jimmy loses his support . Ray nods , impressed .
RAY: Cooch . What 's the Fort Laramie Treaty ?
COOCH: Jesus , I do n't know . You tell me . You 're the Indian .
RAY: Cooch . Where the fuck did they send us ?
COOCH: A long way from home . You be careful out there .
RAY: For all I know , you 're Jimmy . And you 're just waiting for a shot at my jugular . Drink , Jimmy . Milk is good for you
CROW HORSE: Do n't be mad . That was just an old traditional gesture that means hello , how are you .
RAY: I see . Forgive my cultural ignorance .
CROW HORSE: Jimmy did n't do it , Ray . I checked it out . You can stop taggin ' my sister .
RAY: She 's your sister ?
CROW HORSE: So did this one . Wambli is a rare and sacred creature . When someone finds a dead one , the feathers get around the res . We share everything . A lot of power in the eagle feathers . But you think that 's bullshit too , do n't
RAY: Leo Fast Elk was sitting in the outhouse at Maisy Blue Legs when a car pulled into the yard . He came out , approached the vehicle then saw that the man behind the wheel was Jimmy . He tried to get back into the trailer , but the car came highballing at him . He started running for the open grass . With the car moving , Jimmy hung his shotgun out the window , took aim missed once , hitting the shitter fired again , and severed Leo 's spine . Leo fell , rolled , and came to a stop in the grass . And some chicken feed . Stale chicken feed with four days mold . Electromagnetic printing . Crow Horse stares , a little surprised .
CROW HORSE: Was-te . 'Cept for one thing . Jimmy Looks Twice was nowhere near there . Ya see , when Jimmy was twelve years old , his mother and father was killed in a car wreck right down there nea Elk Mountain .
RAY: I do n't see the connection .
CROW HORSE: The connection is , it did a head number on him . He 's petrified of cars . Wo n't drive . I 've known him all my life , and he 's never gotten ehind the wheel of a vehicle . He ides passenger and he rides horses , and that 's it . The man that shot Leo down was behind the wheel of a moving car . Ray absorbs this with great interest .
RAY: That 's not solid .
CROW HORSE: You want solid ? That one , single , print he left in the Badlands the one the FBI missed and then stepped all over it belongs to a man who walks heels first . Like a white man . Jimmy has a serious Ind ' n walk all of the foot first . The man who murdered Leo walked like a Wasi'cu . Ray lets a pent-up sigh escape .
RAY: You 're saying a white guy did it
CROW HORSE: When Leo was dumped out there in the Badlands , he was dropped on his back . Our man made an effort to turn him over , onto his face . It 's an old Ind ' n belief that if a dead man is turned face down , his spirit wo n't leave . And in the killer 's case , it wo n't come back and jump all ove his shit . That 's an Ind ' n thing a white man would n't know .
RAY: Alright , Crow Horse . I 'm listening . I 'm listening to the trees , to the stones . Who is it ?
CROW HORSE: Damned if I know . And he hauls his bulk onto his motorbike .
RAY: The old man ? He 's gon na tell you who killed Leo ?
CROW HORSE: Go catch Jimmy , Ray . Really . He 's gettin ' away . Go ahead , go get him . I 'm late .
RAY: Hey . Hey , those are my sunglasses you 're wearing .
CROW HORSE: Grandpa traded with me . Goodbye .
RAY: I ca n't do that , It 's a Rolex .
CROW HORSE: A what ?
RAY: I 'm sorry , this is this is very , very expensive . It 's Tell him this is an expensive watch .
CROW HORSE: He says , you need to go on Indian time . He says your watch is ruining your life anyway .
RAY: Do n't tell me heavy duty .
CROW HORSE: Heavy , heavy duty . Taku Wakan . Wanagi Spirits . It 's one of those few places we 'd never go to as kids . Still do n't . Some of the old people say Crazy Horse is buried back there . We have to go Ray . Together . Like his vision .
RAY: Walter . When I fill out my 302 , do I say that evil spirits are killing everybody on the reservation ?
CROW HORSE: Ray
RAY: no . No offense to the old man . I appreciate you trying to help . But I put my ass on the line coming out here , man .
CROW HORSE: What 'd you expect to hear ?
RAY: Not Native American myths and legends . I 'm with the FBI , Walter , remember ? Not National Geographic .
CROW HORSE: What you call myths , we call ou history .
RAY: It 's not real .
CROW HORSE: What 's real to you ? Wall Street ? Capital Hill ? Now they are myths .
RAY: I ca n't be dicking around here . That 's all I 'm saying . I do n't carry crystals , I do n't wan na come back in another life . I just wan na do my job , and do it right , and get the fuck outta here .
CROW HORSE: You ai n't no Indian . You 're a Sal Mineo Indian .
GRANDPA: Will ya knock it off ? You 're actin ' like a couple of old women .
RAY: He speaks English .
CROW HORSE: Only when he 's really pissed off .
GRANDPA: Come inside . Watch TV .
CROW HORSE: Do n't accuse nothin ' of not bein ' eal , Little Weasel . Cuz the only thing around here that ai n't real is you .
RAY: Take care of yourself , Walter .
CROW HORSE: Likewise .
SA SHERMAN: We 've gotten word that Jimmy has een trying to hook up with Maggie Eagle Bear but some of the Warriors have been sending word to Jimmy that she may be an FBI operative . So he does n't know where to go .
COOCH: Bingo . It 's working .
SHERMAN: He 's out of room . All the reservation exits have been watchdogged . We got him . I give it twelve hours .
RAY: Well we better use those twelve hours to apprehend the right man .
COOCH: The right man ? Talk to me , Ray .
RAY: Whoever dusted Leo , dusted him from the driver 's seat of a moving ca then drove those eight miles to the Badlands . Jimmy Looks Twice has neve een behind the wheel of a car . It 's a known fact out here that he 's petrified of driving . His parents were killed in a car wreck . Cooch nods , lights another smoke , intrigued .
SHERMAN: That 's not very solid .
RAY: There was also a print found in the Badlands that indicated diagetic locomotion . Heels first . Jimmy 's walking pattern does n't match . He has a distinct Indian walk .
SA MILES: Indian walk ? You been smoking hooch in the peace pipe , Ray ?
RAY: They do n't smoke hooch in The Pipe , Miles . They smoke something called kinickinick , it 's like a tobacco . Sherman looks at Cooch .
SA SHERMAN: Well , you 're right about X21 being a Washington Redskin , that 's for sure . What else , Ray ?
COOCH: You boys want a soda ?
SA MILES: Oh , yeah , a Coke . You buying ?
COOCH: No , Ray 's buying . Sherman ? Coke ?
SHERMAN: Oh no . No , Cooch , I 'm working on a coffee here . Indian walk ?
COOCH: Genetic ditto on evidence found at the site with evidence you found in his belongings . An incontrovertible motive . And definite footprints on Jimmy Looks Twice at Maisy Blue Legs house .
RAY: When did we get that ?
COOCH: Today . And now you there 's a dog in the van
RAY: I know . I fed it , and I ca n't get id of
COOCH: You were n't sent here to go off on your own detail , Ray . You were sent here to assist in a Selective Operations Unit . These regional agents are inept that 's why they were sent out here to The Graveyard , to Indian Country . I need you behind me , Ray . Not pulling against me .
RAY: I 'm not trying to pull against you , Cooch . I 've just been having nightmares about the way Leo was killed .
COOCH: Your first homicide , that 's gon na happen , Ray
RAY: I just wan na make sure no one else gets done in that way because we were in bed with the wrong doer .
COOCH: Ray . I never get into bed with somebody unless I know for sure . Just the way I was raised .
RAY: Alright . Alright
COOCH: Yeah , alright , alright fuck you give a yuppie a badge and he wants to take over the world . Go get a tail on Eagle Bear , and stay with her . Cuz Jimmy 's gon na show . And I want you to make the collar . Ray nods , starting for the van .
RAY: Thanks , Cooch .
COOCH: And get rid of the dog .
RAY: Motherfucker .
COOCH: Bastards
RAY: All I could think of was not here . I do n't wan na eat it on an Indian Reservation , three thousand miles from home .
COOCH: He 's out there . He 's out there playing Sitting Bull with us . I want the motherfucker so bad I 'm getting a leeding ulcer .
RAY: It may have been Maggie 's way of saying `` get off my ass . ''
COOCH: She 's that subtle ?
RAY: Eagle 's claws and a bear 's balls that 's what her profile says .
COOCH: Well , she 's running now , too . These fucking people like to run , do n't
RAY: Cooch . Woh . Stop .
COOCH: Tread matches . It 's the car .
RAY: Yes . Excited , Ray walks off , scanning the area .
COOCH: But this does n't make any sense , Ray . If it 's just been sitting in this dry wash for seven days why the hell did n't we find it ?
RAY: Because this is n't a dry wash .
COOCH: The Little Walking River . You 're ight . This is part of it . So whoeve sunk this car did n't compensate fo drought . Goddamn .
RAY: Listen to the water
CROW HORSE: Agent Little Weasel , Federal Bura of your Imagination .
RAY: Jesus Christ . You 're hammered . What are you doing ?
CROW HORSE: You 're right about the old man . His power 's long dried up . He 's supposed to be a medicine man but he wo n't go see the people . He says we changed , and we do n't listen . Well , he do n't go out and talk no more . I have n't had a drink in three years but I just turned my sobriety chip into that man behind the bar , and this Hoss is gettin ' watered .
RAY: Cut the shit . You should n't be in here , Man .
CROW HORSE: Cuz I 'm a skin ?
RAY: Cuz you 're a cop .
CROW HORSE: Not no more .
RAY: What are you talking about ?
CROW HORSE: You tell me . You tell me who went to the B.I.A . Bureau of Indian Annihilation and said I was messin ' with your case , man . I do n't give a goddamn about your case .
RAY: And I do n't give a goddamn about whether you wear a badge or not , Crow Horse , but I did n't cut you . Crow Horse shimmers his black eyes onto Ray .
CROW HORSE: Still after Jimmy ?
RAY: They found prints at Blue Legs ' place .
CROW HORSE: Yeah . Jimmy 's prints are there . But they cross over Benjamin Black Star 's prints . And he was n't there until six o'clock the mornin ' after to get eggs from the chickens . So Jimmy was n't there til the next day . Follow ?
RAY: Next time I 'll be ready . You get the word to who ever it is .
CROW HORSE: I ca n't , Hoss . I do n't talk to FBI 's . Ray does n't blink .
RAY: No . I was sent here cuz I 'm Indian . And a good cop .
CROW HORSE: You ever think that maybe you was sent here cuz the FBI 's need one good reason to take out the entire Warrior Movement . And what bette eason than one of their men , gettin ' lown away on the res . A low-rent , expendable public servant sent in to take a bullet for his country .
RAY: I 'm sick of your shit
CROW HORSE: Sorry , we do n't speak United States .
RANCHER'S SON: Yeah , well I do . Get the Jesus up , and get the Jesus out or I 'm gon na go out to my truck and come back with my hardware .
RAY: Woh , hold on there , Jack , you 're
RANCHER'S SON: do n't `` jack '' me , Squanto . I 'll ury your lazy ass right here .
BROOKS: No ! No , you butt holes ! He ai n't skin ! He AI N'T SKIN !
CROW HORSE: Yeah he 's In'dn . Miniconjou Sioux .
RANCHER'S SON: You ai n't Indian ?
OLDER RANCHER: What 's so damn funny ?
CROW HORSE: Well , it 's just that the cavalry used to always threaten the Lakota . The cavalry ai n't around anymore . The Lakota still are .
RANCHER'S SON: I got no trouble tellin ' where you come from , Fat Red .
BAR MAN: Sorry . On the house .
RAY: No plates . No registration . Serial numbers removed . And all prints washed off by the river . That 's great . This is turning out to be a walk in the park , do you know that ?
RADIO: Come back ?
RAY: Never mind .
RADIO: Ray . X22 .
RAY: I read , Cooch .
RADIO: Remember that upside down flag back at Jimmy 's house ? Somebody took it down .
RAY: Good .
RADIO: They took it down , set fire to it , and threw it on the doorstep of room 13 at the Buffalo Butte Motel . You oom . Ray seethes quietly as he drives .
LITTLE GIRL: Are they all right under here ?
MAGGIE: Two-hundred and sixty-seven men , women , old people . And little ones like you . Many killed running along that road you see there .
LITTLE BOY: Where were they runnin ' to ?
MAGGIE: A place called The Stronghold . They died for a dream . But you live . You are their great-great grandchildren and you live . We have to honor their dream . Of protecting the Mother Earth . And being proud of eing Indian .
LITTLE BOY: My mother told me that they call us Indians cuz Columbus was lookin ' fo India when he discovered our country . Maggie smiles at the boy .
MAGGIE: Yeah , well , let me tell you something , Henry just be glad he was n't looking for Turkey .
RAY: No , Maggie . But you 're gon na have to join me for a ride . I 'm taking you to Rapid City . Maggie looks at him . They lock eyes .
MAGGIE: So much power . I see it in your eyes . This hunger for power . Or fo what you think is power .
RAY: You burned an American flag today . And left it for me
MAGGIE: You desecrated it , it had to be urned .
RAY: I desecrated it ?
MAGGIE: You forced an innocent man to run like an animal . You 've tried to poison my people 's hearts against me with your manipulation , with letters I never wrote you 've been watching me eat , work , raise my family wash myself in the river . And now you 're here , arresting me at a sacred place . In your eyes , that 's power .
RAY: If I told you that I think Jimmy 's innocent but I 'm in over my head would you believe me ?
MAGGIE: See those Black Hills out there , Ray ? When the people lost the land in 1868 , the government took everything but those hills . They allowed us to keep those Black Hills , to live there . Signed a treaty . Until they found gold . Then they told us we had to leave because of National interest . They broke that treaty . Anyone who fought or spoke out against it , wound up dead or in jail . And the people wound up here . On a eservation .
RAY: NO . My father never told anybody he had Indian blood . But he still used a few Indian words around the house . He called me Washee . Said it meant good boy . Maggie starts giggling .
MAGGIE: Wa-shee is like a dumpling . Like tallow we put in stew . I think he was calling you chubby boy .
RAY: Great .
MAGGIE: Goodbye Wa-shee .
RAY: Anyone who fought or spoke out against it wound up dead or in jail . Ray looks out the window toward the monument .
COOCH: Jesus , you alright ?
RAY: Yeah . I I fell asleep . I ca n't elieve it . I
COOCH: Never turn your radio off ! I thought I was gon na find you scalped ! Damn it !
RAY: Sorry , Cooch . I lost Eagle Bear
COOCH: never mind Eagle Bear . We 've got Jimmy nailed . Let 's go !
SHERMAN: Where is he , Sam ? Where 's Jimmy ?
COOCH: Trailer 's clean , let 's go .
SHERMAN: You been the one making it rain like that , out there , Sam ?
RAY: Hey , put that down .
SHERMAN: Can you make Jimmy outrun an M-16 , Sam ?
RAY: Sherman !
LOOKS TWICE: Brother , the old man told me about you . Listen to me what was Leo trying to tell me ? He wanted to meet me at Maisy
FED: Save your speeches for prison , Jimmy .
COOCH: Damn . That 's one hard running Indian .
RAY: Look I 'm not who you think I am . I 'm sorry .
GRANDPA: Out back that way is a placed called Wounded Knee . Ray turns .
COOCH: Buffalo burgers and cold beer , Raymond . Do n't worry about the sign out front you do n't have to be Indian anymore .
RAY: Why ?
COOCH: Cuz I want New York .
RAY: Cooch . They sent us out here because the place was being neglected . Now , all of a sudden , there 's two five man SWAT teams out there tonight . Bell Huey choppers flying all ove the place . Federal occupation to catch one guy . Why , Cooch ? What 's going on ?
COOCH: National security , Ray . Get some sleep . Tomorrow , we fly .
RAY: I 'm looking for Richard Yellow Bird .
YELLOW BIRD: The Washington Redskin . Thought you 'd e gone by now .
RAY: Must be a bitch getting around in that wheelchair . How long you been in it ?
YELLOW BIRD: Since I got a iron pipe put across my knees , man . Fight with three wasi'cus , ya know .
RAY: At Sioux Falls Pen ?
YELLOW BIRD: No , that was Leavenworth . This was Sioux Falls . What ya want ?
RAY: Leavenworth a tough joint ?
YELLOW BIRD: You ever try solitary confinement ?
RAY: No . Ca n't say that I have , Richard . Richard do you know why I 'm here ?
YELLOW BIRD: Washington sent ya . I know that .
RAY: Yes , Washington sent me , Richard . They sent me here because this whole thing has been fucked . Do you know what I mean when I say this whole thing has been fucked , Richard ? Yellow Bird stares at Ray .
YELLOW BIRD: I 'm here , ai n't I ? Ray lets a tense breath out .
RAY: Not for long , Richard . You got early parole under the stipulation that you would help us in a situation , and you did n't deliver .
YELLOW BIRD: What the fuck you talkin ' about ?
RAY: Get up out of the chair , Richard .
YELLOW BIRD: What 's with you people ? Why do ya have to fuck with my head all the time ? I came through , man .
RAY: Get up out of the chair , and walk toward the backdoor , Richard .
YELLOW BIRD: I get thrown in solitary until I do n't know my own fuckin ' name , and then you people tell me I can beat nine years if I help you . I helped you !
RAY: Get up !
YELLOW BIRD: They said I 'd never see FBI again , and I 'm livin ' with you fuckers . I do n't feed ya information on the Warriors , it 's back to the pen . I do n't do this , back to the pen . You word against my word . Against a con Indian 's word . I really got a chance , man , right ?
RAY: They sent me here , Richard because they said you did n't hold up you end of the arrangement , and I have to transport you back to Leavenworth .
YELLOW BIRD: What the fuck , man ? What do you people want ? I did what you wasi'cu 's told me to do .
RAY: Leo Fast Elk is alive . Yellow Bird wheels .
YELLOW BIRD: No way . No fuckin ' way .
RAY: How the hell do you know ?
YELLOW BIRD: I blew his back out with a buffalo gun , that 's how I know ! Now you 're gon na say I did n't , so you can throw me back in solitary ?
RAY: The men who came to see you at Leavenworth . The one 's who made the arrangement who were they ? Maybe I can talk to them .
YELLOW BIRD: Miles . Three other suits . That 's all I know 'em as suits . Were you there ?
RAY: You turned Leo over on his face . But the coyotes must 've turned him back over , man , cuz his spirit is out . It 's out , and it knows .
YELLOW BIRD: What do you know about spirits ? You ai n't no In'dn .
RAY: Leo knew something heavy and was trying to tell Jimmy . But you must not know how serious it was or you would have delivered . Do you realize what Leo could have told Jimmy ? ! Do you ? !
YELLOW BIRD: I took him out before he got the chance . He did n't say nothin ' about Tashka Sha . And now his spirit is in the dirt . Forever .
RAY: What 's Tashka Sha , speak English , speak English !
YELLOW BIRD: Red Deer Table ! What 's with you , man ?
RAY: I 'm the fucking law ! Yellow Bird jumps back , raising his hands .
YELLOW BIRD: All I know is I did what I did and I ai n't in solitary , gettin ' pumped up with downer , gettin ' beat to shit . But I tell you what , Suit . Take me back . Cuz I ca n't take this shit no more .
RAY: You and me both .

CROW HORSE: Five-hundred year old turtleshell attle
RAY: Crow Horse , listen
CROW HORSE: Where 's Maggie ? Where 'd ya take her .
RAY: Nowhere . I 'm trying to find her .
CROW HORSE: You got Jimmy . Let her go .
RAY: Crow Horse , listen . You have to come with me .
CROW HORSE: Why ? So you can get rid of me , too ?
RAY: No . So we can do what the old man said . Red Deer Table , Walter . We have to go .
CROW HORSE: Maybe the old man 's visions are still strong . Ray nods , concentrating . After a time
RAY: Do they come in dreams , these visions ?
CROW HORSE: Oh yeah . Dreams . Sometimes durin ' sickness . Vision quest . Sweat Lodge . Ya never know when .
RAY: Just before we caught Jimmy I had a dream that I was being chased . And I was running with other people . Old- fashion Indian people . I got shot in the back . Like Leo .
CROW HORSE: Where was this ?
RAY: At Wounded Knee . I mean , that 's where I was , and that 's where the dream was . Why ?
CROW HORSE: You were running with the old ones . At The Knee . Heavy duty .
RAY: Well , it was just a dream , I
CROW HORSE: Sonuvabuck ! What 's with you , Man ? Who are you ?
RAY: What do you mean ?
CROW HORSE: Nothin ' . Forget it .
RAY: Sorry .
CROW HORSE: I 'm a full-blood Oglala .
RAY: We 've driven a long way . Where is this place ?
CROW HORSE: Maybe it was just a dream . Ya know , just one of them , what do ya call 'em , fitful dreams ?
RAY: Yeah . Fitful dreams .
CROW HORSE: Bullshit . You had a vision . You got sign from the old ones .
RAY: What the hell do you want me to do ? !
CROW HORSE: Stop .
RAY: What 's that ?
CROW HORSE: Ai n't prayer flags , that 's for sure .
RAY: Jesus . Oil ?
CROW HORSE: Uranium . Test holes . Somebody came in from the Nebraska side , and did some shotgun testin ' . They 're gettin ' eady to suck this baby dry .
RAY: 1868
CROW HORSE: What ?
RAY: That 's what we 're doing here . National interest . National security . Only this time it 's not gold . It 's uranium .
CROW HORSE: We 're standin ' on broken treaty ground , Ray . This ai n't supposed to e here . It 'll poison the water .
RAY: Leo knew about it . Tried to tell Jimmy , get the Warriors involved .
CROW HORSE: So they took care of Leo .
RAY: Listen to the water the rive keeps goin ' down then rising again .
CROW HORSE: They 're drainin ' our water table . That 's our life , man Ray is looking past Crow Horse at
CROW HORSE: Yeah . It 's time to beat the drum . You better wait here . He do n't trust the white man .
RAY: What we need is Richard Yellow Bird .
CROW HORSE: I thought it was a rare case of a other getting a break in the courts . We did an honorin ' song for him and everything .
RAY: He 's looking at a few hundred years in Leavenworth . He 's not gon na come out without a fight .
RADIO: X21 . Read . X21
RAY: X21 . Come back .

RICE: Know what the problem is , kid ? You 're too ugly to get propositioned .
REILLY: Look who 's talking , old man .
RICE: C'mon , it 's a quiet night .
REILLY: I got ta get back on top . Get off the sleaze detail .
BAG LADY: A small gift , sir , for the Queen
RICE: Here you go , your Highness .
BAG LADY: Thank you , officer .
REILLY: So what 'll you do ? After they give you the gold watch .
RICE: Hell , I got a gold watch it just do n't work . Maybe they 'll give me a new fishing pole , or something useful .
REILLY: You do n't fish .
RICE: How hard can it be ? The grand kids been uggin ' me about taking them camping .
REILLY: You outta the city that 's a fish out of water . What 's with all this family talk lately , anyway ?
RICE: One of these days you 're gon na get tired of fighting the shit . When that happens , you 'll wish you had family .
REILLY: No thanks . I got close but it never woulda worked .
RICE: Why do n't you just shoot it and put it out of its misery ?
REILLY: What are you talking about , it 's purring like a kitty .
RICE: I thought you said what's-her-name 's brothe was going to fix it .
REILLY: She did n't work out , had to cut her loose .
RICE: What was it this time ?
REILLY: She wanted to cook me breakfast .
RICE: We 're vice , I did n't see no pimps or hookers in that van . But if you 're so gung-ho , we 'd est call it in for some back-up .
REILLY: Nah , let 's just take a look-see .
RICE: You okay ?
REILLY: Yeah , just a nick
RICE: Freeze ! Police !
REILLY: Drop it !
SWAN: Let her go .
EARRING: We got ta get outta here !

RICE: Take your time one day at a time , kid
REILLY: It do n't work-
RICE: Ai n't that a shit
HARRY: Hey , Reilly , Captain 's looking for you .
PLUCHINSKY: Nothing so far .
REILLY: Captain
PLUCHINSKY: You 're vice , not homicide . Besides , you do n't have the experience and you 're too personally involved .
REILLY: But sir
HARRY: She wo n't talk . Look at this shit , no I.D. , nothing
PLUCHINSKY: What 's that ?
HARRY: Bracelet she was wearing .
REILLY: Looks like the stuff my dad used to use to low up tree stumps back in Scranton .
PLUCHINSKY: Maybe she knows your old man .
REILLY: I 'll do it .
BEV: May I help you ?
REILLY: I 'm looking for the Bomb Squad .
BEV: They 're not here .
REILLY: Where are they ?
BEV: And you are ?
REILLY: Officer Reilly , vice .
BEV: There out on a call , perhaps I can help you-

POOCH: Schnoz says it 's loaded . Good boy , Schnozzie .
GLASS: Alright boys , look close . Let 's assess .
POOCH: Whadaya think , `` boy '' or `` girl '' ?
GLASS: It 's a `` girl '' !
POOCH: No shit . I better send Meg flowers just in case .
REILLY: Who 's in charge here ?
POOCH: He is !
REILLY: Look , it 's important .
GLASS: Where did you get this ?
REILLY: Off a girl 's wrist . A suspect
GLASS: High-grade det cord . This girl , either she 's got strange taste in jewelry or she 's into serious demolition .
REILLY: What do you mean ?
POOCH: Fire in the hole !
GLASS: Sorry about that . That 's an inch of the stuff , imagine what the whole thing 'd do .
REILLY: Thanks .
GLASS: Hey wait a minute-
POOCH: That 'd be some explosive pussy he 's got his hands on .
EARRING: They 're holding her downtown .
SWAN: What about the cop ?
BEARD: If you 'd let me waste him .
EARRING: What if she talks ?
SWAN: She wo n't .
BEARD: I say we split town . Come back to this jo when things cool . We 've got other contracts - Denver , Seattle
SWAN: I want her back and we do the job .
BEARD: I thought we agreed , the personal ca n't interfere with the professional .
EARRING: Besides , we 're on a schedule and the cops wo n't let her go .
SWAN: Unless we make them .
EARRING: Hey
REILLY: Captain-
OFFICER: Captain , line one !
SWAN'S VOICE: I said release the girl or alot of people are going to die .
PLUCHINSKY: What the hell was that ?
REILLY: A ticking bomb
PLUCHINSKY: It 's a bluff . The guy 's full of crap .
REILLY: I 'll do it .
POOCH: No , honey , I 'm fine . Yeah , well , you 're welcome . You deserve flowers more often .
GLASS: Bev , you 're the greatest
BEV: Hey , that 's the guy-

REILLY: We can start in the area where the robbery occurred .
GLASS: Easy , guys .
REILLY: What 're you talking about ?
REILLY: We 've got one hour . Are you coming or not ?
POOCH: What do you think ?
GLASS: Call upstairs , see what you can find out .
POOCH: Right .
GLASS: T.J. , run a trace on this , see if you can pin down where it came from . Whoeve
SWAN: What time is it ?
EARRING: Twenty after .
BEARD: Swan , it 's no use . Look , we can still make Houston
SWAN: Shut up !
KNOCKOUT: Fuck off , pal .
FIRE CHIEF: Eight dead , so far .
PLUCHINSKY: What 're you doing here ?
REILLY: You touch me again and
PLUCHINSKY: And what , you 'll shoot me ? Hey , do n't mistake me for one of your partners , I 'd like to make etirement in one piece .
REILLY: Sir
GLASS: Hope you do n't mind , Captain , might help us catch these guys that much sooner . Coming ?
PLUCHINSKY: I 'm filing charges against that mother-
REILLY: What was- ? Why ?
GLASS: That cop who bought it you did n't tell us he was your partner .
REILLY: What ?
GLASS: This is n't bumper cars , it 's brain surgery . You wan na work with us , you do it our way , understand ?
REILLY: Now wait just a fucking-
GLASS: Be cool around my men , they do n't trust strangers . And try not to swear so much , it 's unattractive .
REILLY: Mike Reilly .
POOCH: That there 's Schnoz , mascot and ace bom sniffer . Say hi , Schnozzie .
REILLY: What kind of bomb was it ?
GLASS: We do n't use the b-word . Bad luck .
GLASS: Treat . We treat devices .
REILLY: Anything else I should know ?
GLASS: Do n't push it , slick .
POOCH: I do n't know
GLASS: C4 , plastic explosive .
POOCH: Hey , check this out ?
GLASS: Lem me see that .
REILLY: I 'll get back to you .
PLUCHINSKY: You were lucky today , vice boy . Captain said to leave it alone , but just remember , I 'm watching you .
REILLY: I 'm sorry , detective , but you 're just not my type .
OFFICER: Captain , it 's him !
SWAN'S VOICE: Do n't make me send another .
REILLY: Where 's the girl ? The one I brought in .
BOOKING OFFICER: Upstairs , interrogation .
BORED COP: Three hours . She 's tough .
HARRY: Tough ? Tough is `` Fuck you , where 's my lawyer ? '' . This chick does n't say boo .
REILLY: Any luck ?
HARRY: Bupkiss . Sorry about Rice .
REILLY: Captain said I could give it a crack .
HARRY: She ai n't no hooker . This is a murde investigation .
REILLY: She was my collar . Maybe I 'll get lucky . But , if you got a problem with that , talk to the Captain .
HARRY: I 'll be in the can .
REILLY: You remember me .
POOCH: We missed you , where 'd you go ?
GLASS: I was wrong this did n't come from any cash register .
POOCH: Whadaya mean ?
GLASS: It 's from an IRA .
POOCH: Oh shit
REILLY: A what ?
GLASS: I.R.A . device . Deadliest class of tickers in existence . Computerized , multiple sensors , ooby traps , the works . First showed up in a series of I.R.A . bombings in London couple years ago . One of their boys tripped it on himself and they went back to a less complicated timers . The Girl , is she Irish ?
REILLY: She 's not talking . But , she could be . So , obviously , you 've seen one of these devices efore ?
GLASS: Only once , at Redstone .
REILLY: Where ?
POOCH: Shit . We 're fucked .
GLASS: Relax , Pooch , it 's just a ticker , it 's not personal .
BEV: Stop it
POOCH: Shut up , T.J. !
BEV: Be nice Pooch !
REILLY: All of you , shut the fuck up !
GLASS: Nice performance back there . Where 'd you learn that , Mike Ditka Sensitivity Seminar ?
REILLY: Hey , look
GLASS: No you look , mister ! First , you do n't go calling my men names . It 's bad for morale . Second , us `` punks '' happen to know a heck of alot more about police work than any vice cop ever did .
REILLY: Oh yeah ? Prove it .
GLASS: Drive .
REILLY: The place has already be combed . Forensics pulled over a hundred sets of prints inside .
GLASS: Then let 's go see what they missed .
REILLY: I do n't know . You tell me ?
GLASS: An abandoned machine shop nice place to uild devices . Low rent , too . But , you and Rice ruined their perfect hideout .
REILLY: You mentioned something called Redstone .
REILLY: Cream of the crop , huh ? You ?
GLASS: Top of my class at West Point , thank you very much . Then off to Redstone . First half of the course we learned how to build devices second half , we 'd take them apart . Everything from firecrackers to hydrogen bombs .
REILLY: Sounds like terrorist heaven .
GLASS: There were a few guys in my class with names like John Smith , Bill Jones . I 'd see them up ahead in the hall , call their name , but they would n't turn around . C.I.A . Funny thing , they 'd always disappear after the first half of the course .
REILLY: Just how easy is it to build a device ?
GLASS: With a little training , you could go into a house and just from stuff in the bathroom and kitchen make something that 'd finish off that alleged car of yours . Heck , did n't you eve watch MacGyver ?
REILLY: Girl was here . The guy in charge was ove there with one of his men , the other one was ack there .
GLASS: Typical profile , usually losers , nobodies that 're afraid to confront their victims . They like scaring people . That 's why they call in their threats . Same mentality as obscene phone callers .
REILLY: Except they 'll blow you up if you do n't play along .
GLASS: No , ninety-ninety percent of them are full of aloney . They 're into the power trip , not the damage . What scares me is that this guy is so sophisticated he could blow up whatever he wants , then disappear . The worst of the unch , they love the challenge of creating the wildest device ever and they love the carnage .
GLASS: This is where the van was parked .
REILLY: Yep .
GLASS: Then , it 's got ta be here somewhere
REILLY: Look , it 's a longshot
GLASS: Bingo !
REILLY: Nitro-cellulose . What is that , some kind of explosive ?
GLASS: Industrial wood oil . Separately , any one of
POOCH: Ka-Boooom .
BEV: They make bowling balls out of vulcanized ubber
POOCH: Resin
GLASS: A bowling alley .
REILLY: You mean you just ? You keep a record of matches ?
GLASS: Hey , matches are a very big thing in our line of work .
POOCH: `` Punks '' , huh ?
GLASS: Bev , give ` em a call , find out what bowling alleys they supply in this area .
BEV: Right !
GLASS: Pooch , why do n't you e-mail your buddies at Langley and on the other side of the pond , see if any IRAs been popping up lately ?
POOCH: You got it .
GLASS: We work fast enough for you ?
REILLY: T.J. , what 're you doing ?
GLASS: How long are we going to stay ?
REILLY: ` Til we get a better lead .
POOCH: Unsolved bombings in the last year Boston , New York , Philadelphia but no real match
REILLY: Insurance ?
GLASS: Political .
POOCH: Exactly my thinking . Except , none of the targets can actually be linked to government , political or special interest concerns . They seem to be just unrelated industrial companies . Some insured , some not .
GLASS: Not bad for Bomb squad , eh ?
REILLY: What not bad . You 've got a series of bombs ,
GLASS: Right .
POOCH: I got a friend over at Scotland Yard who 's gon na try and reach out to a undercover guy who would know if any of the rightwingers are circulating over here . Bev 's following up on the briefcase manufacturers , too .
REILLY: Still waiting for a miracle . Go ahead .
GLASS: It 's a small fraternity , everyone knows everyone . I 'm always recruiting . Pooch is ex- D.O.D. , military expert claymores , grenades . He played linebacker at Boston College , worked a K-9 unit - that led him to the Bomb Squad great nose , lousy fingers , we try to keep him away from the tickers . T.J. is a heck of chemist , Texas A & M engineering degree . Found him in a Militia chat room - turns out we were both monitoring the same groups . Bev is the natural born hacker , we stole her from dispatch . She had the Cave reorganized and ultra-high-tech in two months . Captain has no idea how much hardware she 's `` found '' for us .
REILLY: You guys seem pretty tight .
GLASS: We 've got ta be . In this business , you do n't exactly make alot of outside commitments .
REILLY: Why do you do it ?
GLASS: I do n't know , it 's strange it 's not the est career path , but when you get the bug , there 's nothing you can do about it . See , when you beat one of these things
REILLY: Looks like Pooch 's doing okay .
GLASS: He set one , the son-of-a
REILLY: You heard him , get the fuck away , it 's a bomb !
GLASS: Alright . Let 's assess .
TJ: IRA .
POOCH: Oh shit
GLASS: Okay , I 'm going in , nobody breathe .
REILLY: So cut both .
GLASS: One shuts it down , one turns arms it .
REILLY: Which one 's which ?
GLASS: I do n't know . There 's an old saying , when in doubt , cut the yellow wire .
REILLY: No , I 'm with you .
GLASS: Is this a great job or what ?
REILLY: Nothing . Nothing traceable .
POOCH: I do n't know , honey . I 'll see . No , everything 's fine , it was nothing .
GLASS: Meg 's lasagna . Good eats , Reilly . C'mon .
REILLY: Got work to do , do n't we ?
POOCH: In case you change your mind .
REILLY: Report on the case so far .
REPORTER: To recap , a gunman carrying what police described as a phony bomb was shot and killed less than an hour ago .
BEARD: She talked .
MEG: More coffee , T.J. ?
REILLY: Mike . No thanks , I 'm fine .
POOCH: Time for bed , kiddos . Say goodnight .
TOMMY: Can Uncle Teej tuck us in ?
REILLY: ` Night
GLASS: How long were you hooked ?
REILLY: What ?
GLASS: You do n't have to talk about it .
REILLY: Pittsburgh , two years ago . Partner died , no ack-up , I was too gung-ho . As usual .
GLASS: Take a tip from the Bomb Boys , always assess , if only for a second .
REILLY: I know . I was working a drug ring , deep cover . Played the part too well . When they pulled me out , I was n't a cop anymore . My fiance had dumped me . Next thing I knew , I was out here on the street , doped up ,
GLASS: Your partner ?
REILLY: I guess I did n't realize how much I needed him . He kept me straight . It 's been tough every second since .
GLASS: Let me see .
REILLY: I terrible with mechanical things .
REILLY: It 's working .
GLASS: Congratulations , you just built you first ticker .
REILLY: Okay , hit it .
GLASS: Alright !
POOCH: Nothing . Maybe they gave up , split town .
REILLY: Do n't bet on it .
BEV: One partial from the handle matches the suspect from last night . Name 's Carl Taylor . Long record of arson , assault , the works . The other print - we got nothing from our data ase or the FBI or CIA still waiting fo Interpol .
REILLY: Damn .
BEV: Coffee , Mike ?
REILLY: No thanks , Bev .
BEV: Yes , sir . He 's here . I 'll tell him .
REILLY: Yes , sir .
HARRY: I 'll be outside .

REILLY: Thank you .
MARY: He 's my brother
REILLY: Then why tell me ?
MARY: People are dying .
GLASS: Ex-girlfriend ?
REILLY: Be right back .
BAG LADY: No .
REILLY: No , of course not well , thanks anyway . Here you go , Your Highness .
BAG LADY: On second thought , maybe I did .
REILLY: You 're beautiful !
HARRY: Ran the license plate - car was rented early this morning from a Hertz office downtown .
PLUCHINSKY: Alex Swan - demolitions expert , trained at Redstone , dropped out , freelanced in the middle East for awhile , then disappeared , no criminal record . The other one , Leveau , is French Canadian , he 's a mercenary , record in half a dozen countries .
PLUCHINSKY: Yes , sir .
BEARD: We 've got company .
REILLY: Glass , there they are . Pooch right in front of you , you got ` em , you got ` em .
POOCH: Oh damn .
REILLY: My God , you 're going to use her , are n't you ?

MIKE: You got one ? Sheryl hits the `` Play '' button .
SHERYL: You loaded these songs . You do n't need to be so impressed with yourself .
MIKE: I know I do n't have to be .
SHERYL: I have n't even heard of half these ands .
MIKE: It 's called good music . You should try to familiarize yourself with it , instead of listening to the crap you do .
SHERYL: I listen to crap ?
MIKE: Hurts me to be the one to tell you .
SHERYL: I 'm sure it does .
MIKE: You got ta be more like me , baby . Think new , fresh , cutting edge . I 'm looking for the next Beatles , U2 o Radiohead .
SHERYL: So , where does this band fall into that group ?
MIKE: How 'd that get on there ?

SAM: Now what can I do you two for ?
MIKE: Wellah
SAM: First time here and you 're not quite sure where to begin .
SHERYL: Precisely like that .
SAM: Get you started with one of these .
MIKE: Two days . Heading out early Sunday .

SHERYL: Any particular path ?
SAM: You folks experienced hikers ?
MIKE: We 've done some ah
SHERYL: No . Nothing like this .
SAM: For first-timers , I recommend eithe Willow Creek Bridge or Donner Trail .
SHERYL: Donner Trail ? As in `` The Donne Party ? ''
SAM: I 'm not sure of the name 's origin . They 're the two paths we regularly patrol . Something happens and you 're on one of the other trails , it might e awhile before we find you .
MIKE: Where do we camp ?
SAM: Unless it says not to , you can set up where you like . Just make sure when you turn in that you extinguish you fire . Oh , and this here 's bea country . They 're not animals to fool with . You see one , you head the othe way , especially if he 's feeding . If the bear thinks you 're getting in the way of his food , that 's all she wrote .
SHERYL: Great .
SAM: You got yourself a first aid kit ?
MIKE: Nurse Betty here 's my first aid kit . Sam looks confused
SHERYL: Do n't mind him . I 'm a nurse .
SAM: Good for you . The question was , do you have a first aid kit ?
SHERYL: Yes , we have a first aid kit .
SAM: Great , see how easy that was . It 's off-season , park 's pretty quiet . Even more than usual . You may run into a few locals , but
SHERYL: People live up here ?
SAM: We have a few generations of families that have called these mountains home . Most of ` em are friendly . Respect thei land and they 'll respect you .
MIKE: Sorry .
SAM: Base is just outside , to the left . At about two miles up there 'll be a junction where you can pick your path .
MIKE: Thanks .
SHERYL: I 'll take mine .
MIKE: Why ?
SHERYL: Just to annoy you .
MIKE: Seriously
SHERYL: In an emergency , I 'd rather have a phone that may not work up there , than not have a phone that may work up there .
MIKE: Okay , we all set ?
SHERYL: Yup .
MIKE: Let 's do this .
SHERYL: Hey , Einstein . What do you think , leave the tent or maybe take it with us ?
MIKE: I was just seeing if you were paying attention .
SHERYL: It could be fun .
MIKE: Not a chance . High School reunions serve only two purposes to try to
SHERYL: So what were you ?
MIKE: Me ? I was a stoner .
SHERYL: So what does that mean ?
MIKE: How the hell am I supposed to emember ? I was high all the time .
SHERYL: It 's cute , right ? I stopped by that Army-Navy store on Grover yesterday . Keeps the sweat out of your eyes .
MIKE: And when you were buying it , you did n't think that maybe
SHERYL: Ohwellit was the last one
MIKE: The last one ?
SHERYL: Yeah
MIKE: The entire Army-Navy store sold out ?
SHERYL: Completely . There was some sort of un on bandanas at the last minute .
MIKE: Fucking nasty .
SHERYL: What is it ?
MIKE: Looks like it 's a , or was , a fox . Come on . Mike and Sheryl head back to the path . ANGLE ON - The MUTILATED , BLOODY FOX .
SHERYL: What do you think ? `` Cannibal '' Trail or the other one ?
MIKE: Guidebook says a couple of these othe trails lead to some pretty sweet views .
SHERYL: We 're not Lewis and/or Clark . We 're gon na stick to one of the ones the Ranger said .
MIKE: We 're just going over our options here .
IDA: Well , take it from me , any way you choose , you ca n't go wrong .
SHERYL: The Ranger at base suggested Donne Trail or
IDA: Willow Creek Bridge . I think Sam only knows those two trails . Well . Between those , I 'd pick Donner Trail . Willow Creek will shoot you to the top , but there 's not as much to see . Donner weaves through Peddler 's Point , it 's a better hike and prettier all around view .
SHERYL: What do you think ? Then , she notices a ring on Sheryl 's finger .
IDA: That 's a pretty ring .
SHERYL: Thank you .
IDA: Not your traditional wedding ring , but it 's all the same in the Lord 's eyes . How long have you two been wed ? Sheryl and Mike trade looks .
SHERYL: Oh we 're not married . Not yet anyway . Mike shoots her a look `` not yet ? ''
IDA: Oh , I 'm sorry . You just looked like you was married is'all . Both so eautiful . I 'm just an old fashioned silly-bird . I need to mind my own business .
SHERYL: No , it 's fine .
MIKE: Which one of those trails got the best clearings ?
IDA: Clearings ? Neither will give you much in the way of clearings . But , there 's another path , this one here . Timber Falls . Its got some beautiful vistas and one of the prettiest falls you 'll ever see .
MIKE: Sounds perfect . Yeah ?
IDA: Well , I 'll leave you to it . Last thing you need is me fussing'round you , taking you from your private time .
SHERYL: I suddenly feel the need fo confession .
MIKE: Not yet ? Love taking your shots , do n't ya ?
SHERYL: When I see an opening .
MIKE: That path she was talking about winds through these falls . What do you think ?
SHERYL: I think if you get eaten by a bea and there is n't a Ranger around , I 'm not carrying what 's left of you down this mountain .
MIKE: And they say romance is dead . Timber Falls it is .
SHERYL: You really were stoned through high school . As Mike and Sheryl trek up the path
MIKE: You 're going to lose that out here .
SHERYL: It 's fine . I never take it off . Not since you gave it to me . Betcha do n't emember
MIKE: February 27 , 2006 .
SHERYL: I 've got you so whipped .
MIKE: OUCH ! FUCK !
SHERYL: What ?
MIKE: My hand Something stuck it .
SHERYL: It 's okay . It 's not too deep . Let me get the first aid kit .
MIKE: Fuck . That stung .
SHERYL: Got ta clean the wound , baby .
MIKE: You know me and blood we do n't do so well .
SHERYL: I know . All done .
MIKE: Not bad , Nightingale . Not bad at all .
SHERYL: Did you hear something ?
MIKE: It 's probably the deer .
SHERYL: The deer went in the other direction .
MIKE: Maybe it 's someone , or something , stalking us .
SHERYL: Quit it .
MIKE: Something inhuman watching our every move .
SHERYL: I said , knock it off .
MIKE: Something coming for you , Sheryl . Sheryl straps on her backpack .
SHERYL: Just when I think there 's hope fo you .
MIKE: What ?
SHERYL: You 're an asshole . Sheryl walks away .
MIKE: This is a joke . You 're not really mad , are you ? Sheryl ? She turns the corner and is out of sight .
SHERYL: Does n't feel good to be teased , does it ? Okay , he had that coming .
MIKE: Truce ?
SHERYL: Truce .
MIKE: Do n't disappear on me again .
DARRYL: Looks like we got ourselves a little party .
MIKE: We were just moving our way up the mountain .
LONNIE: You were moving your way'round more than just that .
DARRYL: Like a peach . Mike tries to seem relaxed and friendly .
BRODY: You folks best be careful about what you do up here Never know who 's watching .
MIKE: Appreciate the adviceI think we learned our lesson . Brody nods as he looks them up and down .
LONNIE: You city folk , ai n't ya ? Up from Charleston roughing it , seeing how the `` other '' half lives ?
MIKE: No , we 're from Virginia , just up for a weekend trip . And , uh you folks live up here ?
BRODY: It 's easy to spot the city folk . It 's like they 're trying to be friendly , when really they do n't want to be .
MIKE: I think you just startled us is all . Sheryl looks over at
DARRYL: Finders keepers . Long beat . Tension high .
BRODY: Darryl .
LONNIE: Yeah , we just getting acquainted and shit .
MIKE: We just want to get a little furthe along before the sun sets .
DARRYL: Plenty of time'fore that .
MIKE: Look . We do n't want any trouble . We just want to be on our way
BRODY: And why do you suppose we mean to make trouble ?
MIKE: Excuse me ? The what ?
DARRYL: Spirits .
LONNIE: Booze !
MIKE: Sure . Yeah .
BRODY: Why do n't you try a taste of this ?
DARRYL: Betcha never tasted nuthin'like that ? Darryl would win that bet .
BRODY: Fifty bucks . Mike has no idea what he 's talking about .
DARRYL: Or maybe we could do us a little trade .
MIKE: Let me get my wallet .
SHERYL: Fifty bucks sounds like a bargain . Pay the man .
BRODY: Pleasure doing business with ya . Take care now .
LONNIE: Should you tire of your present company just holla and I 'll come unning with bells on darling .
MIKE: Are you okay ?
SHERYL: You brought a gun ?
MIKE: Same reason you brought you cellphone . Better to have it and not need it . To protect us .
SHERYL: Lotta good it just did .
MIKE: You want to go back ? Sheryl ? I 'm sorry .
SHERYL: We should have stuck to one of the patrolled paths . Sheryl charges ahead , back to the path .
MIKE: Fuck .
SHERYL: Yeah .
MIKE: I 'm sorry .
SHERYL: Do you know how many times I 've had someone die on me ? How many children ? I stopped keeping count .
MIKE: I thought I was n't thinking . What do you want me to do ?
SHERYL: Get rid of the gun .
MIKE: What now ? Out here ? She holds firm .
SHERYL: Then get rid of the bullets now and when we get home , you get rid of the gun .
MIKE: Yes . Mike steps back to Sheryl , they hug .
SHERYL: Thank you .
CLYDE: Oh . Did n't mean to startle you folks . Just clearing some of the brush off
MIKE: It 's fine . We were led to believe this trail was n't regularly patrolled .
CLYDE: It 's not , but It 's one of my favorite spots , so I often find an excuse to swing by .
SHERYL: It 's gorgeous .
CLYDE: Yup . There are a couple more falls in the park , but none quite so inviting as this one . Now do n't take my word for it , you can see fo yourself How long 's your stay ?
SHERYL: Just til Sunday .
CLYDE: Yeah , no . The other falls are clear on the other side . It would take you a couple nights just to get there .
SHERYL: Maybe next time .
MIKE: This is a quickie trip . Just getting out of the city for a couple days .
CLYDE: The city , huh . Which ? If it 's Charleston , I would n't blame ya . Whole place smells like feet . I got ta haul myself all the way down to the hospital there for my yearly because the darn HMO 's rules and regulations wo n't let me visit the local Doc . Not my cup of tea at all , but if you like it there , then
SHERYL: No , we 're not from Charleston .
MIKE: But apparently we look like we are .
SHERYL: We live in Alexandria . It 's just outside of D.C .
CLYDE: Oh . I 've been there , few years back . Now that city I like . Lotta beautiful churches if I recall correctly . Which congregation do y'all belong to ?
MIKE: Um Not sure . Sheryl keeps track of all that for us . Sheryl ?
SHERYL: Uh We 're between congregations at the moment . Awkward .
CLYDE: Well I should get back to work . Sun 'll be down soon and that path ai n't gettin'clear on its own . Clyde walks off , until
SHERYL: Excuse me Sir ?
CLYDE: The name 's Clyde .
SHERYL: Clyde , would you recommend a nice spot nearby to make camp for the night ?
CLYDE: Be happy too Let 's see Oh , I got it . `` Five Corners '' will be perfect . It 's just a bit up the ways here , near the Lake . It 's five large ocks which sit in a clearing with a view of the whole park . The rocks etain the heat from the day , so if you set up camp between them you wo n't e so cold .
SHERYL: Sounds perfect .
MIKE: Thanks .
CLYDE: Just doing my job . You have fun and e careful . Good evening . Clyde tips his cap and disappears .
SHERYL: This is incredible .
MIKE: What ?
SHERYL: The lake . I 'd kill to rinse off . Sheryl makes a move
MIKE: Whoa . Wait a sec . It 'll be dark soon .
SHERYL: Where 's your sense of adventure ? She takes off .
MIKE: Sher . Seriously . Let 's wait ` til morning .
SHERYL: Fine .
MIKE: I think its pretty obvious that I do n't . Sheryl laughs .
SHERYL: You cooked .
MIKE: Yeah , I 'm aware . You know what would make this evening perfect ? Moonshine . I got a whole jar of it . There 's a sentence I neve thought I 'd say . `` I have a jar of moonshine . '' Matter of fact , I 've got enough to share with our entire congregation
SHERYL: in Charleston .
MIKE: Our home city , of course . But I should start with you Would you like some moonshine ? Sheryl smiles , shakes her head playfully .
SHERYL: I 'd like to fuck you .
MIKE: Not very Christian of you .
SHERYL: I 'm more Old Testament .
MIKE: What 's that mean ?
SHERYL: Not sure . But I think it 's the nastier of the two books .
MIKE: I was good . I mean , even better than usual .
SHERYL: If you do n't say so
MIKE: if I do n't say so myself , yeah . Top notch performance . What , you disagree ?
SHERYL: Nah , it was good . Do you think I had anything to do
MIKE: No . All me .
SHERYL: Fine . I liked what the old woman said about us earlier .
MIKE: What did she say ?
SHERYL: That she thought we were married .
MIKE: You are relentless . Mike gets up , starts dressing .
SHERYL: I would n't be a proper girlfriend if I did n't nag every now and then .
MIKE: I get it , but it makes me feel like the bad guy every time . Which makes me feel like shit .
SHERYL: I 'm sorry . I did n't mean that . Where are you going ?
MIKE: Do out there , what you did in here .
SHERYL: What 's that ?
MIKE: Put out the fire .
LONNIE: What is it ? Hear something ? Darryl holds his look into the woods , then
DARRYL: Nah . It 's nothing .
MIKE: Where is she ! ?
DARRYL: Whoa take it easy .
MIKE: Where is she ?
DARRYL: Who ? What the fuck you talking about ?
MIKE: What did you do to her ?
DARRYL: I did n't fuckin ' do nothing .
MIKE: WHERE IS SHE ? !
DARRYL: I do n't know !
MIKE: You have Sheryl 's towelWhat the fuck did you do to her ? !

MIKE: Shut the fuck up .
DARRYL: You best hope you find her'fore I do . ` cause I will enjoy tearing her ass apart . And when I 'm done there , I will cut her eyeballs out and skull fuck her . Any luck , Brody 's already beat me to it .
MIKE: Sonofabitch !
IDA: Michael , can you hear me ? Michael
MIKE: Ow !
IDA: Look who 's up .
MIKE: Where am I ?
IDA: You 're in my home , Michael . You gave me quite a scare . I thought I lost you .
MIKE: Thank you . For saving my life .
IDA: You do n't have to thank me . Up here , we take care of one another . That 's the only way any of us survive .
MIKE: Um I 'm sorry , but I do n't know your name .

MIKE: How did you know my name ?
IDA: Excuse me ?
MIKE: Michael . You keep calling me Michael . You did it just now . You did before , just after I woke up . You called me Michael . Nobody calls me Michael .

SHERYL: Get me out of here . Hurry .
MIKE: Who 's he ?
SHERYL: Come on , come on , come on
MIKE: Fuck ! He banged his injured leg on something .
SHERYL: What are you doing ?
MIKE: Sheryl , run ! But Sheryl freezes .
SHERYL: Mike ? Mike ?
CLYDE: Oh my stars , what happened to you ?
SHERYL: You have to help me . I was kidnapped . My boyfriend came And this man 's chasing me . He 's chasing me right now .
CLYDE: Calm down . I ca n't make heads o tails of what you 're saying .
SHERYL: He 's coming . He 's right behind me .
CLYDE: Look , miss , there 's no one there .
SHERYL: Oh my God , Mike .
CLYDE: It 's going to be fine , Miss . I promise you . Everything 's going to be fine . Sheryl pries her face from Clyde 's chest .
IDA: Perfect . Just perfect . You are lovely as a summer 's day . It 's almost time .
CLYDE: That 's enough . Get him ready .
IDA: Amen .
CLYDE: And so , in the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ , I ask you Michael and you Sheryl , do you accept the sacred covenant of marriage ?
MIKE: Why are you doing this ? We did nothing to you people . Let us go !
CLYDE: You may kiss the bride .
MIKE: You fucking people are fucking sick ! Clyde 's temper flares
CLYDE: Do not use that type of language in this house again . Now kiss the ide or he 'll cut off your lips .
MIKE: I love you . Mike kisses her briefly on the cheek .
IDA: I know you will .
CLYDE: Gon na untie your mouth , now . Have a little `` man to man '' talk . Clyde undoes the gag in Mike 's mouth .
MIKE: Please It 's not too late . Let us go . We wo n't tell anyone .
CLYDE: How well do you know your bible , Michael ?
MIKE: Jesus Fucking Christ Clyde SLAPS Mike across the face .
CLYDE: I told you before to watch that mouth , mister .
MIKE: Fuck you .
CLYDE: You through ? Mike spits some blood on the floor . Nods .
MIKE: Not very .
CLYDE: That 's okay . It 's fine . That 's why I am here teach you the way things are and the way they should be .
IDA: I 'll be right back .
SHERYL: I want you , Deacon . I want you to fuck me . Hard . ON DEACON - His stare deepens .
CLYDE: Lord knows the will of a man gets tested . Cruelly most times . But the ighteous persevere . They do what needs to be done , even though they do n't want to . It 's what makes a man , a man . Let me tell you the story of Judas , he was one of Jesus 's apostles . Judas led Roman Soldiers to the capture and eventual death of our Lord Jesus Christ . And now , is supposedly seated next to Satan , his soul burning in hell forever for this sin . But I do n't believe that 's the case . I have my own theory . The death of Jesus was predicted thousands of years before Judas ever came along . And for the prophecy to be fulfilled , Jesus had to die . If he did n't , the gates of heaven could n't be opened for mankind . I do n't think , for an instant , Judas wanted to be the one , but someone had to . Judas helped Jesus , so Jesus could die for our sins . Save us all . And I believe at this moment Judas is in heaven , despite his sin , because it led to the greater good . Relations prior to marriage is a sin . You and Sheryl are sinners in the Lord 's eyes . And because of those sins , your souls are damned . But Ida and Me , we 're gon na give you a chance to save your souls and do the right thing , but as previously stated , you will need to persevere and show the strength and will of you character . But you 'll do it . Because that 's what needs to be done .
IDA: You get away from her . Git ! Now !
SHERYL: Please do n't do this . Please let me go . Please..I just want to go home .
IDA: Drink the tea .
SHERYL: Why are you doing this ?
IDA: I thought you 'd be happy about that . All I ever wanted out of life was two things to be married and to have a aby . The Lord blessed me with Clyde and I thank Him every day for that . Ida pours some more tea into Sheryl .
CLYDE: She can conceive fine just ca n't seem to make it all the way through . Timothy was the toughest Made it to month eight .
MIKE: What exactly do you want from us ?
IDA: You 're young , strong It 's gon na be easy for you . Not like me .
SHERYL: Wh-what ?
IDA: You 're gon na have a baby , Sheryl . My baby .
MIKE: Oh my God
IDA: She 'll be out for hours , but she 's fine .
CLYDE: Ida 'll come back in a little bit , check to see that the deed has been done . If it hasn'tthe next time you see your little ladya piece of her will be missing .
IDA: Now , we know conception 's not automatic . So do n't feel like all the pressure 's on right now . We 're prepared to do this however long it takes . You give us the effort each time , eventually the magic will happen .
MIKE: You 're out of your fucking minds .
CLYDE: What did I tell you about the language ?
IDA: We 'll let you have your privacy now . Oh , almost forgot .
CLYDE: It will .
IDA: Promise me . Promise me , Clyde .
CLYDE: I promise .
MIKE: No , but
CLYDE: Did you understand what was expected of you ?
MIKE: Yes , but How do you expect
CLYDE: Clearly you did not understand . You did not even attempt relations last evening .
MIKE: What you 're asking to do is sick . You 're sick .
CLYDE: You did n't have a problem when penetration was a sin , but when it 's your wife , it 's sick ? ! ? Unbelievable .
IDA: Be home at the regular time ?
CLYDE: Might be a bit late . I have an errand that needs attending to . Clyde kisses Ida , exits .
MIKE: You do n't have to do this . Come on .
SHERYL: What are they doing to him ?
IDA: You should concern yourself with what 's about to happen to you .
SHERYL: What are you doing , Ida ?
IDA: You think you 're so much smarter than me , do n't you ?
SHERYL: No .
IDA: Yes you do . Admit it'cause I can see it in your eyes , darling . With you fancy schools and job and such . You think you are better than me .
SHERYL: No , I do n't . Yes she does .
IDA: Might surprise you , but I was quite the student back in the day . Straight A 's . Every subject'cept for Science . Infuriated me how they tried to explain away the Lord 's creations . Our teacher , Mr. Billings , once said in the future , humans wo n't be orn with a pinky finger'cause of evolution . Of all the I shouted , `` No ! We are created in the Lord 's image not some nonsensical theory by Darwind . ''
MIKE: No more . Please . No more .
SHERYL: Please Ida , do n't . Do n't do this .
IDA: You think I want to hurt a pretty thing like you ? Pains me , but until you and your husband obey , my hands , much like yours , are tied .
SHERYL: I know about your condition , Ida . It 's not your fault . There are a lot of women that ca n't carry a baby full term . I know how much you 're hurting .
IDA: You do n't know anything about me o what I 've gone through .
SHERYL: I 'm here for you now . I 'll help you . Please . Ida stares at Sheryl debating
IDA: You can help by following the ules .
BRODY: Clyde !
CLYDE: G'morning , Brody .
BRODY: I stopped by your place the other day .
CLYDE: Ida mentioned .
BRODY: So have you seen or heard anything about that man hiker ?
CLYDE: In fact I have . I saw him and his lady leave .
BRODY: When was this ?
CLYDE: Yesterday . Just before dusk .
BRODY: Bullshit .
CLYDE: Believe what you want .
BRODY: I saw their car last night in the parking lot at base . So they did n't leave , `` Just before dusk . ''
CLYDE: Well , I was down at base this morning car 's gone now .
BRODY: Something do n't feel right here , Clyde . Between you and Ida
CLYDE: I do n't have time for this
BRODY: What do you know about that hiker you ai n't telling me ? Brody waits a beat , then lets him go .
CLYDE: I told you , Brody I saw them leave . Let it go .
MIKE: How do you expect me to do this ? Like this ?
CLYDE: Do we need to provide you with some more motivation ?
IDA: You would n't want to put that lovely ide of yours through a day like she had today again , now would you ?
MIKE: You 'll never get away with this . We have friends and family . They know where we went . They 'll come looking for us . They 'll find us !
CLYDE: That may very well be but they wo n't find your car .
MIKE: Oh baby , what did they do to you ? I 'm sorry . I 'm so sorry .
SHERYL: Are they gone ?
MIKE: Yeah . You 're awake ?
SHERYL: I did n't swallow that shit she gave me .
MIKE: It 's okay . I 'm okay .
SHERYL: You 're not okay . We 're not okay . What are we gon na do ?
MIKE: I do n't know .
SHERYL: Maybe we should just give them what they want ?
MIKE: What ?
SHERYL: If it stops them from hurting you and me maybe we should
MIKE: Absolutely not . No fucking way . Forget the fact , that the moment you get pregnant , they 'll kill me . Then the moment you give birth , you 're dead . Beyond both of those reasons ai n't no fucking way I am going to give them our child . Tears POUR from Sheryl .
SHERYL: He ?
MIKE: Wishful thinking . I picture you heart your eyes And I picture us , raising him . Growing old with him . No . Ai n't no fucking way I 'm going to give him to them . They keep talking about sins that would be the worst sin of them all . I 'll get us out of this , Sheryl . I promise you .
CLYDE: It 's time .
EVELYN: Good morning , Sam .
SAM: Ai n't no better than any of the othe days , Evelyn , so bring the `` glee '' down some , would ya ?
EVELYN: Hey , Sam , do you remember a Virginia couple pass through here sometime Friday ?

MIKE: You do n't have to check Nothing happened . Clyde and Ida are pissed .
CLYDE: We do appreciate your honesty , Michael . And believe me , we understand your extreme situation , ut Punishment 's going to have to e handed down . Suddenly , Clyde 's walkie-talkie goes off .
MIKE: I told you . I told they 'd be coming .
CLYDE: Copy that . Clyde thinks a beat , then
BRODY: Shit . Get rid of the dope .
EVELYN: Morning , gentlemen . Pardon me Afternoon .
LONNIE: Evelyn , damn , hurts looking at you . When you gon na give it up to me ?
EVELYN: Now with a line like that , it 's a shocker I have n't already .
LONNIE: You stone cold tease .
EVELYN: Was wondering if either of you had seen any hikers pass by in the last day or so ?
BRODY: What 's this about ? Evelyn hands them a flier .
EVELYN: It would seem so . Why , have you seen them ?
BRODY: You talk to Clyde about this ?
EVELYN: All the Rangers are on the lookout . Family 's even offering up a reward .
BRODY: How much ?
EVELYN: Pardon ?
BRODY: How much they offering ?
EVELYN: Do n't exactly know . I 'm guessing it 's a fair amount .
BRODY: Well , me and Lonnie will keep a lookout for you too . Anything we can do to help . Evelyn begins walking off .
LONNIE: You change you mind , I 'll ride you aw . Evelyn ignores Lonnie , moves on her way .
CLYDE: Noose is starting to tighten , Ida .
IDA: No . You promised . You promised , this time , would be the time . I want that aby . You promised .
CLYDE: We 're gon na have to double ou efforts , here .
IDA: Leave that to me .
CLYDE: I think we have to have another man to man discussion , here , Michael .
MIKE: I do n't know Seems as though Deacon and yourselves get a real kick out of it .
CLYDE: Now see , this is what I am talking about . It 's your attitude . It 's the disobedience , the cussingSooner we get what we want , then no further harm has to fall upon you and your wife .
MIKE: Way I see it , you need us alive . You need us , period . And now that Park Services and State Police are looking for us , you 're starting to panic ,
SHERYL: No .
CLYDE: What was that ?
IDA: Deacon ! Stop right there !
CLYDE: This is getting out of hand , y'all . Nobody wanted what just almost happened to Sheryl to happen . But , you keep dragging this thing out things are gon na happen .
IDA: I sent Deacon away for a bit . He knows he done wrong . You say right now that you are ready to perform you marital duties , then I 'll keep him away .
MIKE: Have you ever thought that God does n't want you to have a child ? That 's why he fucking kills them before they 're orn . Because you 're fucking insane monsters that do n't deserve a child . Ida SLAPS Mike .
IDA: You take that back !
MIKE: No .
IDA: Take it back .
MIKE: Go ahead and torture me . There 's absolutely no way I would ever give a child of mine to you .
IDA: How very brave . Fine . I wo n't torture you . I 'll torture her . I can bring back Deacon . Let him have her . Plenty of other holes he can go into where a aby ca n't be made . Ida grabs a nearby knife , walks up to Sheryl .
MIKE: No !
IDA: Then you will give me my baby . My child , born in wedlock , saved from its sinner parents and raised to fear God and give him praise .
SHERYL: That 's why you married us ? So we could conceive our child in wedlock ? The fucking joke 's on you I 'm already pregnant . Eight weeks yesterday . Clyde and Ida stare disbelievingly at Sheryl .
IDA: You 're lying . Mike stares in shock at Sheryl .
SHERYL: I was trying to find the right time to tell you . TEARS fill both their eyes .
IDA: No , no , no , no ! This ca n't be . NO !
LONNIE: We should n't just go in . Ai n't right . Brody slides open the window .
BRODY: I 'm going in . You do n't want to , then do n't . Check round back or something .
LONNIE: Hello ?
MIKE: Help ! Down here !
CLYDE: Ida you know what we have to do ?
IDA: No . I can give her an abortion . Get id of the bastard child , make them conceive one in wedlock . And then we are right as rain .
CLYDE: Abortion ? No . That we wo n't do .
IDA: It 'll work . Ai n't no sin to abort a demon .
CLYDE: Ida , writings on the wall here . Michael 's right . With a reward on the table , do you think Brody and Lonnie will be the only two coming ? Gon na have lots people looking for these two . We 're gon na have to make it so no one can ever find them .
IDA: No .
CLYDE: We 'll find another couple , Ida .
IDA: No . You promised me , Clyde , this time was the one .
CLYDE: It 's too dangerous . We 'll find another couple . A better one .
IDA: It 's not fair .
CLYDE: I 'll do what needs to be done . You finish up here And watch you time , rain 's coming .
MIKE: Believe me , I understand your extreme situation , but Punishment 's going to have to be handed down .
SHERYL: What is it ?
MIKE: No more ammo .
IDA: NO !
IDA: There is no soul blacker than yours . And now , by the grace of God , I must deliver you to Satan myself .
MIKE: I ca n't make it .
SHERYL: I 'm not leaving you .
MIKE: Clyde 's walkie-talkie . It 's probably upstairs . Find it . Call the Range ase . My gun . See if you can find ou stuff . My gun 's in my backpack , side pocket .
SHERYL: What good 's the gun ? You tossed away the bullets . Mike turns away . Guilt etched on his face .
MIKE: There 's another box of ammo .
SHERYL: Mike ! ? !
MIKE: Let 's get out of this alive first , then you can bitch me out , okay ?
SHERYL: Hello ? Come in , please . We need help . Is anyone there ?
EVELYN: This is Ranger Base , Go again ?
SHERYL: Mike !
MIKE: Sheryl ! A path of blood left in Mike 's wake .
SHERYL: Burn in hell you sonofabitch ! She drops it
MIKE: Love you .
SHERYL: Well , if you love me Fight . Please aby , fight .
EVELYN: Called your folks . There gunna meet us at the hospital . Be a while since they 're coming in from D.C .
SHERYL: Why ? What is it ?
EVELYN: You 've had an exhausting night , why do n't you
SHERYL: What is it ?
EVELYN: We did n't find anybody like that in the yard or the house .
SHERYL: No . It 's not possible . She turns , looks around , but spies nothing
EVELYN: Calm down . It 's gunna be alright
SHERYL: Fuck you it 's gon na be alright .
DR. HILLYER: I say , this is outright rude of the man !
FILBEY: He 's undoubtedly been detained . That 's all .
DR. HILLYER: Speak up what is it , woman ?
BRIDEWELL: Wellare we or are we not invited to dinner ? FILBY Apparently we are . How long has he been gone ? MRS. WATCHETT I ca n't rightly say , sir . - Several daysI hardly catch a glimpse of him lately . He never leaves the laboratory and comes out only to nibble at his mealsbut he did tell me days ago about dinner tonight and left these instructions .
FILBY: Thank you , Mrs. Watchett .
MRS. WATCHETT: Dinner is served , gentlemen ! BRIDEWELL First sensible thing I 've heard all evening .
FILBY: This is peculiar . He is usually very prompt , precise and punctual .
DR. HILLYER: He 's making fools of us by inviting us here and then not showing up . It 's not the behavior of a gentleman .
KEMP: To say nothing of the waste of time . DR. HILLYER To say nothing of the waste of time .
FILBY: Good lord ! - What 's happened ?
TIME TRAVELLER: I 'm all rightjust some fooda drink
DR. HILLYER: Well , ca n't you speak , man ? What happened to you ? Are n't you going to tell us
BRIDEWELL: Leave him alone , ca n't you ? TIME TRAVELLER It 's all right . - I want to tell .
FILBY: It will keep , George . Eat , rest a little .
TIME TRAVELLER: No ! I must tell it now while I still remember .
FILBY: Relax , try to relax a bit . You 've all the time in the world .
TIME TRAVELLER: You 're right , David . That 's exactly what I have . - All the time in the world ! ever since we were all togethe five days ago , the last day of Eighteen Hundred Ninety Nine .
BRIDEWELL: Marvelous . DR. HILLYER What is it ?
TIME TRAVELLER: Well , it has to do with time .
DR. HILLYER: I 've always maintained what this nation needs is a reliable timepiece . The Navy needs one . The Army needs one . - For the artillery you know . KEMP Could n't do better , George . So that 's why you 've been in hiding . - Clever of you , indeed ! FILBY I do n't believe George is referring to a new kind of timepiece .
TIME TRAVELLER: When I speak of time , I 'm referring to the fourth dimension . A perplexed look comes over Bridewell 's face .
FILBY: Go on , George .
TIME TRAVELLER: Now , as you know , the difficulty in explaining the fourth dimension is that it can not be seen or felt - it must be thought of .
FILBY: If you do n't mind , George , would you refresh me on the first three dimensions .
DR. HILLYER: Really , Filby , they must have taught you something at school ! BRIDEWELL Suppose you explain it , Doctor .
TIME TRAVELLER: On the contrary , Doctor ! The fourth dimension is as true and as eal a dimension as any of the other three . In fact , they could n't exist without it . DR. HILLYER How do you mean ?
DR. HILLYER: No .
TIME TRAVELLER: So - for an object to exist at all , it must exist in the fourth dimen- sion.and that fourth dimension is duration.Time ! DR. HILLYER All right ! But what 's in that box ?
KEMP: George ! You 've given a most lucid explanation and all that ! But I do n't think I entirely understand .
TIME TRAVELLER: Look ! There are a lot of things in the world you do n't understand , are n't there ?
KEMP: Of course ! Quite a number .
TIME TRAVELLER: But you do n't refuse to believe in them because of that ?
KEMP: Not if I can see the proof with my own eyes .
TIME TRAVELLER: Good ! All I 'm asking you to do now is to witness a demonstration of the possibility of movement in the fourth dimension . Philip , will you please hand me that box ?
BRIDEWELL: Oh , I say George ! If you start floating around in the future , are n't you likely to mess things up for the est of us ?
DR. HILLYER: The future is already there . It 's irrevocable and can not be changed .
TIME TRAVELLER: That 's the most important question to which I hope to find an answer . Can Man control his destiny ? Can he change the shape of things to come ?
KEMP: Go ahead .
TIME TRAVELLER: You 're ready then ?
DR. HILLYER: Where did it go ? TIME TRAVELLER Go ? Nowhere in the usual sense . It 's still here . But it 's no longer in the present . It 's traveling through time - to the future , to be precise .
TIME TRAVELLER: Certainly .
DR. HILLYER: But you just said it has n't eally moved .
TIME TRAVELLER: That 's correct .
DR. HILLYER: Then why ca n't we see it ?
TIME TRAVELLER: Because we 're in this room on December 31st , 1899 , while the model you saw is perhaps a hundred years away . This room , or even this house , may no longer exist a hundred years from now . But the Time Machine is occupying the same space it did a moment before it went off on its journey .
KEMP: Suppose what you say is true . Exactly what do you suggest we do with such a contraption ?
TIME TRAVELLER: For my part , I intend to take a journey into the future . - Unless someone else prefers to volunteer . There is no response . BRIDEWELL I say , George . Suppose you go off and get lost in the fiftieth century ! How will you find your way back ? TIME TRAVELLER That 's a calculated risk I 'm prepared to take .
DR. HILLYER: Now listen , George ! I do n't know what you take us for , but we 're not fools . There are a number of ways of doing a disappearing trick ! But a man of your ability should not bothe with such nonsense .
KEMP: Yes , we all have our plans fo tonight .
TIME TRAVELLER: Of course , I am .
AD LIBS: Happy New Year . - Goodbye , George - Happy Twentieth Century . - Etc .
DR. HILLYER: Come on , Bridewell .
FILBY: I thought I 'd better stay .
TIME TRAVELLER: I appreciate your gesture , David , ut if you do n't mind I 'd rathe you left me alone .
FILBY: You have changed , George . Enormously .
TIME TRAVELLER: I 'm sorry . FILBY Will you answer me one question honestly ?
FILBY: Why this preoccupation with Time ? TIME TRAVELLER Why not ?
TIME TRAVELLER: You may have to . I do n't . FILBY All right . Take a journey on you contraption . What would you become ? A Greek ? A Roman ? One of the Pharaohs ?
FILBY: You 're not seriously saying you can do it ?
TIME TRAVELLER: You saw the experiment this afternoon , did n't you ?
FILBY: I saw a toy machine vanish . But I 'm certain there are a number of ways of doing that trick . Any magician at the Hippodrome could probably do it . TIME TRAVELLER It was no trick ! - Would you care to see the full-scale model ?
TIME TRAVELLER: Now you sound like Hillyer and Kemp .
FILBY: There is something in their common sense attitude to life . George , I speak to you as a friend . More , as a brother . If that machine can do what you say it candestroy it . Destroy it , George , before it destroys you .
TIME TRAVELLER: You must have plans for New Year 's Eve . Do n't let me keep you .
FILBY: Mary is n't well . We decided to stay home with the baby . But why do n't you come home with me . You have n't seen little Jaime for a long time .
TIME TRAVELLER: I ca n't .
FILBY: What 's stopping you ?
TIME TRAVELLER: I just want to see the old century out by myself . FILBY Have it your own way . He goes to the door .
FILBY: Will you promise me that you wo n't leave the house tonight ?
TIME TRAVELLER: I promise you , I wo n't walk out of the door .
FILBY: Very well .
TIME TRAVELLER: Fineand will you bring the others with you ? FILBY Whatever you say , George . - Happy New Year . TIME TRAVELLER And a very happy New Year to you , David .
MRS. WATCHETT: Will you be having supper in this evening , sir ? TIME TRAVELLER I do n't think so , Mrs. Watchett . Why do n't you take the evening off and celebrate .
TIME TRAVELLER: Goodnight .
MRS. WATCHETT: Happy New Year , sir .
TIME TRAVELLER: Filby ! I expected more of an enthusiastic greeting from FILBY I 'm afraid you have me confused with my father , sir . There was a emarkable resemblance . - I 'm James Filby .
JAMES FILBY: Were you a friend of father 's ?
TIME TRAVELLER: YesyesI 've been away .
JAMES FILBY: He was killed in the wara yea ago . TIME TRAVELLER No ! it ca n't be I 'm sorry to hear that . And the gentleman who used to live across the street ?
TIME TRAVELLER: Why is that ?
JAMES FILBY: My father was executor of the inventor 's estate and he refused to liquidate it . I often chided him on that account , ut he felt positive that the owne would return some day . - Some people hereabouts think it 's haunted . Who are you , sir ?
TIME TRAVELLER: Just a stranger who once knew you father .
JAMES FILBY: I see . Have you been at the front , sir ?
TIME TRAVELLER: Front ? What front ?
JAMES FILBY: Why the war , of course .
TIME TRAVELLER: What war ?
JAMES FILBY: Great heavens , man , do n't you know we 've been at war with Germany since nineteen fourteen ? I thought perhaps you had seen action in Franceor maybe Perhaps a cup of tea would make you feel better . Wo n't you come in ?
TIME TRAVELLER: Nono , thank you .
JAMES FILBY: You 're sure you 're alright , sir ?
TIME TRAVELLER: Yes , I 'm quite alright . JAMES FILBY Thengoodbye , sir .
TIME TRAVELLER: I ca n't understand you . The warden takes off his helmet . He is David
WARDEN: Confounded radio in this thing . Makes more noise than it does sense .
TIME TRAVELLER: Filby !
WARDEN: My name is Mister Filby . - Did n't you hear the air raid siren ?
TIME TRAVELLER: You mean that horrible screeching ?
WARDEN: It was n't constructed for its aesthetic values , you know , but to warn silly young fools like yourself to get down into the shelter . Now go on .
TIME TRAVELLER: But I 'm perfectly comfortable and I find your store magnificent . What splendid achievements , what gigantic strides mankind has taken , what
WARDEN: Come on , young man . We 'd better be going before the mushrooms start sprouting . You do look familiar . Have n't we met somewhere before ?
TIME TRAVELLER: Indeed we have . Right here . Many years ago .
WARDEN: I was sure of that , but the exact time escapes me .
TIME TRAVELLER: It was two wars ago , I believe . Nineteen seventeen . WARDEN Why now I recall . The chap who inquired about my father and the house that used to be across the way . But nothat 's impossible . You have n't changed . You 're not a day older . And your clothes
WARDEN: The last alerthurry !
TIME TRAVELLER: Listen to me ! It 's important . WARDEN Look ! An atomic satellite zeroing in ! That 's important ! !
WARDEN: Hurry ! Hide 'til the All Clear ! He descends into the air raid shelter .
TIME TRAVELLER: All clear ? I 've got to talk to you . The Time Traveller looks up as he hears the APPROACHING SIRENS OF AN AMBULANCE . Alarmed ,
TIME TRAVELLER: Well , and why not ?
THE GIRL: Why did you ?
TIME TRAVELLER: Why did I what ?
THE GIRL: Come after me . TIME TRAVELLER I did it to save your life , young lady , which I 'm afraid does n't hold much meaning for you or anyone else . THE GIRL It does n't .
TIME TRAVELLER: Must have been fifty of your friends watching you drown . Not one of them so much as lifted a finger . - A curious attitude - in a curious world . Are n't you the least bit interested in what I amwhere I come from ? THE GIRL Should I be ? TIME TRAVELLER Perhaps you 'd better take me to someone a bit older I can talk to .
THE GIRL: There is no one older .
TIME TRAVELLER: Does n't anyone age in this land of yours ?
THE GIRL: Weena .
TIME TRAVELLER: How do you spell that ?
WEENA: Spell ?
TIME TRAVELLER: Write ! - Ca n't you write ? Look !
WEENA: Come . We must go in . TIME TRAVELLER Why ? What 's wrong ? WEENA It is getting dark . She grabs his hand and pulls him toward
TIME TRAVELLER: In my time a berry this size would have made news in every civilized country .
WEENA: I heard you poundingI came to tell you
TIME TRAVELLER: How do you open that panel ?
WEENA: No one opens it . Only the Morlocks .
TIME TRAVELLER: Morlocks ? - Who are the Morlocks ?
WEENA: When they call , we must go below .
TIME TRAVELLER: Do the Morlocks live beneath the earth ? Why must you obey their command ?
WEENA: They give us the food we eat , the clothes we wear . We must do as they command .
TIME TRAVELLER: What happens to your people when they go below ? WEENA No one knows . No one has eve eturned . TIME TRAVELLER It wo n't happen to you .
WEENA: It is night .
TIME TRAVELLER: Only children are frightened by the dark . - But then you are a child , are n't you ? I 'll build a fire . WEENA Let us go from here . TIME TRAVELLER I ca n't , child . My Machine is inside there , I intend to wait here 'til morning , then find some way of getting inside . WEENA No , you must not . TIME TRAVELLER Help me gather some wood .
WEENA: Where are you from ? TIME TRAVELLER As a matter of fact , I 'm from ight here . There 's where my house stood many thousands of years ago . Here - to that monument , was my laboratory . About there was my library where I once sat talking with friends about my Time Machine . Meanwhile , Weena has seated herself near the ushes in the f.g .
TIME TRAVELLER: Get me a few more twigs . When there is no answer he turns and looks .
WEENA: I never saw it before .
TIME TRAVELLER: Do you know that the first thing which separated man from the rest of the mammals was his knowledge of fire ? No , I suppose you do n't . The next great stride came with the discovery of the wheel . Do you know what that is ? I 'm sorry I was angry with you people . I had no right to be . No more than if I had visited the Island of Bali in my own time . You were safe inside your great house , yet you came out into the night to warn me . The one characteristic which distinguished man from the animal kingdom was the spirit of self sacrifice . You have that quality , Girl . I 'm sure all of your people have it . All it equires is someone to reawaken it . I shall try if you 'll let me . Will you ?
WEENA: I do not understand you , but I elieve you .
TIME TRAVELLER: That 's a good start . - Now try to tell mewho or what are the Morlocks ? Are they people or animals ? What do you know about yourself ? The past ? Do n't your people ever speak of the past ?
WEENA: There is no past .
TIME TRAVELLER: Do n't you ever wonder about the future ?
WEENA: There is no future .
TIME TRAVELLER: Man 's past is mainly a grim struggle for survival , but there have been moments when a few voices have spoken up . These rare moments have made the history of man a glorious thing . I efuse to believe it is dead and gone . We 've had our dark ages before and this is only another of them . All you need is for someone to show you the way out . - I 'm only a tinkering mechanic , but there must be this hidden spark in one of your people . If I can only kindle that spark , my coming here will have some meaning .
WEENA: NoMorlocks .
TIME TRAVELLER: You mean those animals run machines ?
WEENA: They are Morlocks .
TIME TRAVELLER: I know , but have you seen the machines ?
WEENA: No , only heard of them .
TIME TRAVELLER: Who told you ?
WEENA: The talking rings .
TIME TRAVELLER: What sort of rings ?
WEENA: Rings that talk .
TIME TRAVELLER: Can you show me these rings ? Weena nods and starts off . He follows her .
WEENA: Yes .
TIME TRAVELLER: They speak ?
WEENA: Yes .
TIME TRAVELLER: Of what ?
WEENA: Things no one here understands .
TIME TRAVELLER: How do you get it to talk ?
WEENA: Nodo n't goplease . He shakes her off .
TIME TRAVELLER: I 'll be back .
TIME TRAVELLER: What 's happening ? Tell me !
TIME TRAVELLER: Stop !
T.T.'S VOICE: So , this was the destiny of the Eloi .
TIME TRAVELLER: Quick , something to burn ! It 's my last match !
WEENA: Are you sorry ? He STOPS WHISTLING , but the MUSIC CONTINUES . He turns .
TIME TRAVELLER: Sorry ? - Sorry for what ?
WEENA: That you have to stay .
TIME TRAVELLER: Yes . - I am sorry because I could tell so much to the people of my own time I could tell them about the happiness and sorrow the future has in store for them . They could learn from itor would they ?
WEENA: You do n't want to stay , do you ?
TIME TRAVELLER: It is n't that , but I do n't fit here anymore than you would in my time .
WEENA: I would like to see your time .
TIME TRAVELLER: No , Girl , you would n't be very happy there .
WEENA: Do you have someone like me - there ?
TIME TRAVELLER: No . No one like you . But there are friends who will miss me . - As a matter of fact , I 'm probably late already .
WEENA: Women ?
TIME TRAVELLER: No , men . There is a woman too , of course ! She looks after my house for me . She is sixty-two years old . - Much older than you are . Weena , relieved , starts to comb her wet hai into a new arrangement .
WEENA: How do they wear their hair ?
TIME TRAVELLER: Who ?
WEENA: The women in your time .
TIME TRAVELLER: Up !
WEENA: Up ? - How ?
TIME TRAVELLER: Like this .
WEENA: Show me .
TIME TRAVELLER: Yesyou would be . More than pretty . I wish we could go back together , Weena , back to my own timeor to times before that when the world was young . We could
DR. HILLYER: It is ridiculous ! Simply preposterous !
BRIDEWELL: Well , there 's one thing I 'll say for you , George . You always could tell a good story . Best adventure yarn I 've heard for years . You 're a truly fine inventor , George ! He alone starts to laugh at his 'joke ' , but a
MRS. WATCHETT: I 'll turn down your bed for you ! As she exits Kemp looks up .
KEMP: Truthfully , where have you been for the past week ?
BRIDEWELL: Now , we should n't ask such questions , Walter . It 's not hard for a man to lose a week now and then . TIME TRAVELLER I understand your doubt . Take it as a lie if you wish . Now that I 'm back I scarcely believe it myself . Except that here are the flowers Weena gave me .
FILBY: I do n't think I can .
DR. HILLYER: Are you coming , Kemp .
KEMP: It 's getting late and you look exhausted . You had better get some rest .
FILBY: Goodnight , George .
TIME TRAVELLER: Thank you , David , for being such a good friend - always .
KEMP: What do you think , Filby ? FILBY One thing is certain . Those flowers could n't have possibly loomed in the winter-time . HILLYER You do n't really think that story was true ? Filby reaches a decision .
FILBY: Look , you chaps go on . It 's just a short walk home for me . HILLYER Go on , driver ! The WHIP CRACKS .
MRS. WATCHETT: Nothing .
FILBY: Which three books ?
MRS. WATCHETT: I do n't know . Is it important ? FILBY No , I suppose not . - Onlywhat three books would you have taken ?
FOR EDUCATIONAL: PURPOSES ONLY
ROMEO: Okay , all bets are down !
TIN CUP: Do n't you shitheels ever get ored ?
EARL: How much we got ta lose ?
TIN CUP: You want to liven things up , Earl ? That 's a hell of an idea . Say everyone puts in twenty bucks and the pot goes to whoever solves the iddle .
DEWEY: You going to get the riddle , Tin Cup ?
TIN CUP: Dewey . I 'm the one asking the iddle . I already know the answer . I do n't getta guess . Although We could say if I get to five hundred bounces and no one gets the riddle , I get the pot . And I know what you 're thinking . It 's an impossible riddle . Well , It 's not . It 's an easy riddle . And if somehow by the grace of fluke luck I win , and you all do n't agree it was an easy iddle , hell , I 'll refund you money .
EARL: Father did n't sneak back in , ight ? He 's still at the othe hospital ?
TIN CUP: It ai n't 'Star Trek , ' Earl . No one beamed him aboard .
EARL: Well if the father married the son 's daughter
TIN CUP: It 's a family riddle , Earl . Think clean thoughts .
CLINT: Give us a little hint .
MOLLY: The doctor is the son 's mother . Feminists pose the riddle to eveal how deeply our sexual stereotypes run . I take it you 're a feminist ?
TIN CUP: Ma'am , I 've been called a lot of things but no one 's eve saddled me with that one .
MOLLY: You might try being saddled sometime the smell of leather , the sting of a whip
TIN CUP: I 'm just a humble golf pro
MOLLY: You 're Roy McAvoy the golf pro ? I pictured something different . I have a seven o'clock lesson .
TIN CUP: I thought I had a Doctor Griswold
MOLLY: I 'm a psychologist in layman 's terms call me a neo-Jungian , post- modern Freudian , holistic secularist .
TIN CUP: Damn .
MOLLY: Inner demons and human frailty are my life 's work . I used to practice in El Paso but I 've moved here now
TIN CUP: What 're those ?
MOLLY: I ordered these from the Golf Channel .
TIN CUP: That stuff 's a waste of money .
MOLLY: I 'm sure there are excesses and epetitions here , but I believe in the gathering of knowledge and I figured , well , there must be some truths about the golf swing illustrated by these devices and that you 'd help me sort through it .
TIN CUP: Take it off . All of it . Now ! You 're a smart woman , fo Chrissakes do n't you know the work of charlatans when you see it ?
MOLLY: No . I can always tell when someone is lying to himself , but I 'm quite susceptible and frequently wrong when that person lies to me . That stuff cost me over 200 dollars
TIN CUP: Then it 's 200 dollars of shit
MOLLY: Aw , fuck
TIN CUP: Well , you talk like a golfer
MOLLY: Shit .
TIN CUP: 'Fuck ' 'Shit ' these are highly technical golf terms and you 're using them on your first lesson this is promising .
MOLLY: Awright , wise ass , show me .
TIN CUP: Something like that .
MOLLY: Impressive . Y'know , I tend to process things verbally . Can you eak down into words how you did that ?
TIN CUP: 'What is the golf swing ? ' by Roy McAvoy . The golf swing is a poem .
MOLLY: A nod to the gods ?
TIN CUP: To the gods , yes that he is fallible . As the weight shifts ack to the left pulled now by powers inside the earth it 's alive , this swing , a living sculpture and down through contact , always down , into terra firma , striking the ball crisply with character a tuning fork goes off in your heart , you alls such a pure feeling is the well-struck golf shot And then the follow through to finish , always on line The reverse ' C ' of the Golden Bear , the steelworker 's power and brawn of Carl Sandburg 's Arnold Palmer , the da Vinci of Hogan , the unfinished symphony of Roy McAvoy .
MOLLY: What ? What 's unfinished ?
TIN CUP: I have a short follow through my swing can look unfinished .
MOLLY: Why ?
TIN CUP: Some say it 's because that 's the est way to play through the winds of West Texas and some say it 's ecause I never finish anything . You can decide . The point is every finishing position is unique as if that is the signature left to the artist , the warrior athlete who ,
MOLLY: Jeez Louise
TIN CUP: There is only one other acceptable theory of how to hit a golf ball .
MOLLY: I 'm afraid to ask . What 's the other theory ?
TIN CUP: Grip it and rip it .
MOLLY: While I appreciate your poetic sensibility , Mr. McAvoy
TIN CUP: Call me Roy , Molly
MOLLY: Call me Dr. Griswold
TIN CUP: Waggle it , Doc , do n't forget to waggle . Waggle the club head it 's a little relaxing itual
MOLLY: What Big Dog ?
TIN CUP: The driver , the number one wood
MOLLY: It 's metal .
TIN CUP: Yeah , woods are metal do n't worry about it and the driver 's known as the Big Dog and I 'm just saying to turn him loose , let ' e ip , let the Big Dog eat !
MOLLY: Oh .
TIN CUP: Yes , ma'am , that 's why I love it . And if you hit one good shot if that tuning fork rings in you loin you ca n't wait to get ack .
MOLLY: I think the Big Dog ate something .
TIN CUP: Did the tuning fork ring in you loin ?
MOLLY: I would n't go that far .
TIN CUP: Always quit on a good shot . We 'll call that lesson number one
MOLLY: If you 're such a legendary strike of the golf ball as everyone says , then why are you , at your age , out here in the middle of nowhere operating a barely solvent establishment , ducking the I.R.S. , collecting a few pathetic dollars to buy your next sixpack when you 're capable of so much more ?
TIN CUP: Perhaps I 'm chocked full of inne demons ?
MOLLY: No , you 're chocked full of ullshit Same time next week ?
TIN CUP: What did you mean I should try 'being saddled ' sometime ?
JOSE: I got it ! Esta bien ! The flag is up !
TIN CUP: A class act there , boys probably the first actual ` lady type ' female ever seen on these premises
ROMEO: Shut up , boss we got the Corpus Christi dog track on the dish
EARL: This is yer dead mortal cinch lock et with Do-reen .
TIN CUP: Free money , boys , what does Doreen know about the fine art of Greyhound breeding ?
ROMEO: All she knows is she likes the three dog 'cause his name is Pride of Odessa 'cause she 's from Odessa .
TIN CUP: Get ready for Oddessa-lation , boys . How deep we in ?
ROMEO: You gave her twenty to one
EARL: It 's only fifteen to one on the toteboard
TIN CUP: Yeah , but I got every other dog in the race . I 'm just getting even with Doreen I 'm not trying to clean her clock .
CLINT: So how much you stand to lose ?
ROMEO: Twelve thousand .
TIN CUP: Hundred .
ROMEO: Thousand .
TIN CUP: Hundred .
ROMEO: You said to shoot the wad .
TIN CUP: I said get even , Pod . I did n't say shoot the wad . We better see that three dog rolling on his ass . All eyes on the monitor the dogs break .
EARL: Except if he breaks slow , he wo n't get creamed
REGULARS: Three dog 's dying , T.C . easy money
ROMEO: So , Roy , you were saying you felt a little flutter for this doctor lady ?
TIN CUP: Yes , I was saying that just efore I was interrupted by ankruptcy a development that the 'Doctor Lady , ' as you call her ,
ROMEO: We lost everything , boss ! We owe Doreen twelve thousand bucks !
TIN CUP: I think I been dating too many ig-haired blondes .
ROMEO: Them big-haired blondes are a lot smarter ' n us how we gon na pay her ?
TIN CUP: You underestimate me , Romes .
ROMEO: It 's a bad habit I picked up from knowing you so long .
TIN CUP: I 'm sure she is They enter the strip joint .
NAKED DANCER: Tin Cup ! Hi , sweetie !
TIN CUP: Hiya , honey lookin ' sweet
ROMEO: You 're looking particularly lovely this evening This is nicer than the leopard suit
DOREEN: Cut the horseshit , guys . So the one and two dogs always run wide and the three dog always eaks slow , so I figure there 's gon na be a big ol ' pile of fur at the turn and the three dog 's gon na tiptoe around it and walk on home I was right . You owe me twelve thousand dollars .
ROMEO: We going to pay you .
DOREEN: I know you 're going to pay me .
TIN CUP: There . With equity and inventory it 's worth twelve grand more o less .
DOREEN: This is how you think you can settle up ? By deeding me you driving range ?
TIN CUP: Only on condition you do n't sell ight away , and me ' n Romeo keep our jobs .
DOREEN: What in the world would I want with your stupid driving range ?
TIN CUP: Equity , inventory , cash flow not to mention an enhanced stature in the community , and prepaid membership in the Salome Chambe of Commerce .
DOREEN: What are your labor costs ? Payroll , Roy . What do you pay
TIN CUP: Let 's see the tractor kid gets five bucks an hour . Romeo , he gets ten cash
DOREEN: What do you pay yourself ?
TIN CUP: Myself ?
DOREEN: To hit golf balls all day when you 're not breaking for beers o corn dogs or to gather the guys and lay bets on which crow flies off the fence next .
TIN CUP: You 're referring to my managerial salary ?
DOREEN: I 'm referring to every nickel you snatch out of the till and every ag of beer nuts you lift from the ack , is what I 'm referring to . I 'll say it 's worth ten and you still owe me two . She smiles , he sighs .
TIN CUP: I still got two grand to pay off . And I ca n't see my new salary of seven bucks an hour plus lessons getting it done .
ROMEO: But your clubs are your livelihood .
TIN CUP: Well the hood ai n't too lively at the moment . A CAR HORN SOUNDS from outside .
ROMEO: David Simms ! What you doing in town ? Romeo steps outside to greet Simms . Warily .
SIMMS: Romeo ! It 's been awhile . Is Tin Cup around ? Romeo is evasive .
ROMEO: He 's on business in Houston You supposed to be out playin ' on the golf tour .
SIMMS: Well , you tell him I 'm in town fo my big charity best-ball tournament , and I got a spot fo him when he comes back from whatever .
ROMEO: You got a spot for Tin Cup ? I thought you hated him .
SIMMS: Romeo ! You wound me . I 'm fond of the guy , going way back to ou days at University of Houston , when we won all those titles together .
ROMEO: He says he carried you on his ack .
SIMMS: I did n't have much craft back then just a little native ability . Roy 's a great ball- striker .
ROMEO: Why you here ?
SIMMS: I want to win my own tournament , and he can help me if we can manage to behave like grownups together . Tell him that . Tin Cup suddenly appears in the doorway .
TIN CUP: What 's the catch ?
SIMMS: There is no catch . I put togethe a tournament with an elite field and a half-million dollar purse , and I 'm tired of seeing all the money head out of town .
TIN CUP: Then make more birdies .
SIMMS: I need you on my team .
TIN CUP: You ai n't that friendly a guy
SIMMS: We 're playing Cottonwood where you once shot fifty-nine , where you can shoot sixty-five in your sleep 'cuz you know every bump on every fairway , every subtle break on every green
TIN CUP: You an ' me
SIMMS: Me an ' you like the old days .
TIN CUP: Well , put 'er there , partner ! These two homeboys are gon na show the world what golf in West Texas is all about !
SIMMS: No , Roy . I did n't mean I want you to play with me . I just want you to caddie for me , read my putts , club me , that kinda stuff .
ROMEO: You son of a bitch .
TIN CUP: Caddie ? Me ?
SIMMS: I ca n't bring a guy in off the street to play in my tournament . It 's a big-time event , corporate sponsors , thirty dollar tickets I got a network to cover
ROMEO: ( interrupting ,
SIMMS: I 'll pay you a hundred for the loop , five percent of any earnings
ROMEO: Get the hell outta here ! Take your goddamn color coordinated corporate sponsored soul and get outta here .
SIMMS: Okay , okay , just thought I 'd offe you some work Simms heads to his car .
TIN CUP: Simms !
SIMMS: What ?
TIN CUP: I 'll take the job .
ROMEO: We 'll take the job .
SIMMS: Like I told you , it was more ' n you had in the bag .
STADLER: Yeah , well I had to go for it after your caddy said he could get home from here .
TIN CUP: I could .
SIMMS: I got ta hand it to you , Roy . Fo fifteen holes you 've seemed to grasp the concept here I 'm trying to win and your job is to help me .
TIN CUP: Five percent of your earnings does numb the gag reflex .
SIMMS: Give me the seven iron . I 'm laying up .
TIN CUP: You can make that shot .
SIMMS: The smart play 's to lay up .
TIN CUP: These fans did n't pay thirty bucks to watch a tour star lay up on a short par five .
SIMMS: I 'm sitting on a two shot lead with three to go , and my partner 's in his pocket . Suddenly , par 's a good number . Gim me the seven Iron .
TIN CUP: No way . You 're going for the green . These fans paid good money to see golf shots they ca n't hit , not golf shots they feel shitty about themselves for having to hit .
SIMMS: Thirteen years in a driving range and you still think this game 's about your testosterone count .
TIN CUP: Two-fifteen to carry , and the tou star 's laying up .
SIMMS: But if you 're gon na editorialize , do it on the other side of the opes . I got no qualms about firing your ass right here , right now .
TIN CUP: Fire me ? Hell , I should fire you .
ROMEO: He can . All the players look at Romeo as
STADLER: Hey , Dave ! We in a hurry ?
SIMMS: We 're trying to win a tournament , pardo .
STADLER: I know . But I 'm getting five to one .
SIMMS: Balls versus brains , Roy . You hit that shot , just keep walking , 'cuz your ass is fired . Tin Cup mulls over the warning , as STADLER , McCORD , MICKELSON Come on , Roy ! Your fans are calling !
TIN CUP: How you gon na fire me in front of all these people ? Especially when I knock it on the green .
KOSTIS: It seems like the Charity Tournament is taking a little
SIMMS: Take a hike , Roy the loop 's over .
TIN CUP: You ca n't fire me . How can you fire me ? I just knocked it stiff from two fifty . Gim me that bag .
SIMMS: Security !
TIN CUP: What about my money ?
SIMMS: You just hit the shot that took you out of the money . Welcome to life on the tour .
TIN CUP: If I had it all to do over , I 'd still hit that shot .
ROMEO: The look comes over your face , you would bury yourself alive to prove you can handle a shovel .
TIN CUP: You know why I 'd still hit that shot ?
ROMEO: 'Cuz it 's the only way you can eat David Simms . 'Cuz you neve got over that he is on tour and you are not . 'Cuz you get that look on your face
TIN CUP: No I 'd hit it again because that shot was a defining moment . And when a defining moment comes along you define the moment or the moment defines you . I did not shrink from the challenge . I rose to it . Romeo nods , holding his peace .
ROMEO: 1981 , Fort Washington Golf Club , Fresno , California , final round of the Tour Qualifying School
TIN CUP: I was playing to win .
ROMEO: A defining moment when you tried to hit the same impossible cut
TIN CUP: Greatness courts failure , Romeo . That 's why most people , in thei whole lives , never ever reach fo the brass ring , never know when to dig deep and try for the impossible shot
ROMEO: You 're right about that , boss , but sometimes sometimes par is good enough to win . Tin Cup tosses down another Maalox cocktail .
DOREEN: The DieHard/West Texas Calcutta , the Duvall County Boys Club Pro Scratch , Woody 's Steak House One Club Scramble what do I want with all these entry forms ?
TIN CUP: It 's a business proposition . I 'm offering you my winnings from all them tournaments this summer .
DOREEN: In exchange for what ?
TIN CUP: My driving range back .
DOREEN: Roy , I 'm not as dumb as my hai makes me look .
TIN CUP: They ai n't all strictly mino league . One of 'em pays almost two grand !
DOREEN: I saw .
TIN CUP: And what does that tell you ?
DOREEN: It tells me you took an unauthorized day off . Next time it happens , you 're fired . In the meantime , I 'm putting in a time clock .
TIN CUP: I 'm not punching in no time
MOLLY: Mr. McAvoy , I can appreciate that you have a fairly laid-back , elaxed lifestyle but I have hours to keep .
TIN CUP: A former paramour once ascribed my fluid sense of time to being born under the sign of Pisces something about floating through the universe
MOLLY: You amuse me , Roy . But I 'm the only woman in America born afte World War II who thinks astrology is a crock of shit . Now let 's see if the Big Dog 'll eat .
TIN CUP: Waggle .
MOLLY: I 'm waggling
TIN CUP: Set up to the ball like I showed you last time .
MOLLY: It 's none of your fucking usiness , Roy .
TIN CUP: Your boyfriend 's a golfer that 's my bet and he 's why you 're taking this game up . Hell , I probably even know him
MOLLY: Hi , sweetie
TIN CUP: Not him
ROMEO: Man , you are having a bad week .
TIN CUP: She must think I 'm such a nothing , such a loser a lousy driving ange pro living in a Winnebago , making five bucks an hour plus lessons .
ROMEO: She do n't know you live in a Winnebago .
TIN CUP: Well , she sure as hell knows I ai n't taking her to no Doral fo massages and mimosas all weekend . I got ta do something with my life . He reflects deeply while Romeo shrugs .
ROMEO: Well you could go out and win The Open .
TIN CUP: Romeo , that idea has promise .
ROMEO: I was joking .
TIN CUP: I ai n't .
ROMEO: We talking about the same tournament ? The U.S. Open ? The Biggest golf tournament in the world ?
TIN CUP: Not just the biggest golf Tournament in the world ; the most democratic .
ROMEO: What do you mean ?
TIN CUP: I mean it 's open . Anyone 's got a shot at it . You just got ta get past a local and a sectional qualifier , and unlike Doral o Colonial or the A.T.T. , they ca n't keep you out . They ca n't ask you if you 're a garbageman or a bean- picker or a driving range pro whose check is signed by a stripper . You qualify , you 're in .
ROMEO: And then you pay out of your own pocket to go there and get all nervous and intimidated
TIN CUP: Who 's intimidated ? I just told you I 'm gon na win the damn thing !
ROMEO: You do n't got the game .
TIN CUP: I got every shot in the book .
ROMEO: I said you do n't got the game . The mental game . The head game .
TIN CUP: You suggesting I err on the side of excess ?
ROMEO: You always go out to shoot zero . Sometimes you pull it off . But you ca n't play like that at the Open . You win by taking what the course gives you . You win by eing humble , which you are n't , and patient , which you never will
TIN CUP: Well , since you 're the authority , How 'd you like to teach me how to e what I ai n't and never will be ?
ROMEO: You do n't ever listen to me .
TIN CUP: This time 'll be different . I promise .
ROMEO: I do n't know , man . Right now you do n't even got the money to get your clubs out of hock .
TIN CUP: Yeah , well my sticks may be in a pawn shop , but I got a rake and a hoe at the range .
BOONE: Let me get this straight you 're going to play me for four hundred dollars with those ?
TIN CUP: And I 'll give ya two a side I got the title to my car as collateral .
BOONE: I 'm not interested in that piece of shit .
TIN CUP: That 's cuz you think of it as transportation , Boone . Think of it as bragging rights . Think of yourself sitting around the ba crowing to your buddies about the Cadillac you won off Tin Cup McAvoy . They 'll forget all about the Winnebago you lost to me .
BOONE: No mullies , no gimmes , no bumping the ball And he rips a drive down the fairway .
TIN CUP: I 'll be playing a Pink Lady today .
BOONE: That little pink fag ball supposed to rattle me ? Tin Cup moves over to the tee markers .
TIN CUP: Not unless I knock it by you .
BOONE: Drive for show , putt for dough , big shot .
TIN CUP: Did you hear that , Romeo ? Boone was being profound ! He has evealed to me the essential mystery of golf ! Drive for show , putt for dough Louisville Slugger , please .
ROMEO: You got Boone shakin ' already Front left bunker 's your best angle to the pin .
TIN CUP: Front left bunker plugged lie .
BOONE: I want to see a legitimate swing . No scooping .
TIN CUP: Stand , please . Gallery , please , stand .
BOONE: Get the hell off my course .
TIN CUP: Listen , swami , your job is to teach me patience and humility , not to advise me on my love life .
ROMEO: No . My job is to get your head straight so you can qualify fo The Open , much less win it . To get your head straight you got to forget about the doctor lady .
TIN CUP: Not all my thinking occurs below the belt . I actually stand for a few things beside where my next omantic interlude is coming from .
ROMEO: Then you got no problem telling the doctor lady you ca n't teach her no more till after the Open .
TIN CUP: That would make an issue of something that ai n't an issue . Besides , I 'm focused . Romeo responds with a Spanish curse .
ROMEO: Ahhh your quest chingaso
TIN CUP: This is where I stand up for all the little guys everywhere who 've had their fill of soulless robots like David Simms
ROMEO: He may be a soulless robot but he 's a rich , happy soulless robot with a beautiful doctor lady girlfriend who 's got you by the huevos Besides , how is getting into the U.S. Open gon na change what she thinks about you ?
TIN CUP: It 'll prove to her that I 'm not who she thinks I am .
ROMEO: But you are who she thinks you are ! Look , I do n't bet on a horse with a hard-on .
TIN CUP: Hard-on ? ! Hard-on ? ! Hard-on ? ! Here , touch me , feel I do n't feel nothing ! Here !
ROMEO: Hey , hey shit cool it
TIN CUP: Okay , okay maybe I got a semi .
DOREEN: I can not give you time off to win The Open . I do n't care if it 's your 'quest ' or your 'destiny ' or any of those terms you vaguely remember from your Cliff Notes You shoulda treated me nicer when we were an item then maybe I would n't be such a nasty boss . G'bye , Roy I have a business to un .
TIN CUP: Man , ever since I let her dump my ass she just ca n't resist kicking me in it .
ROMEO: Maybe you should treat her more like a lady .
TIN CUP: After she ran off with that Dallas anker ?
ROMEO: She did that after you let he dump you . It would n't kill you just once to tell her she 's eautiful , she can dance , she 's
TIN CUP: Romeo are you sweet on Doreen ?
ROMEO: No more ' n you are for that docto lady .
TIN CUP: Great , Romeo , just great just when I need you to be my friend and coach , you go get all gooey about one of my ex-girlfriends who just happens to be our boss .
ROMEO: Anybody comes to me for help on their love life about women is already too far gone .
TIN CUP: I do n't recall asking you fo advice . Women are tougher to figure out than a feathered one iron from a tight lie
ROMEO: Actually if you open the club face a hair and play it off your back foot
TIN CUP: Shut up , Romeo I was n't really seeking golf tips
ROMEO: It 's all I 'm good for but you can count on me for that , at least .
TIN CUP: How far off the back foot ?
ROMEO: 'Bout three balls Silence . Golf is so much easier than life .
TIN CUP: I 'm ready to charge forth in pursuit of my mythic destiny and I ca n't get time off work to do it .
ROMEO: I 'm no expert , but it seems to me that the ` pursuit of a person 's mythic destiny ' is not the sort of thing that a person needs to get off a five dollar an hour job in order to do
TIN CUP: I 'm stuck . Buried . My life 's a plugged lie in a kakuyi bunke with a tight pin position on a green with a stimp meter reading of thirteen . I need help . I need advice . I need counsel I need a shrink .
ROMEO: You do n't know no shrinks .
TIN CUP: I know one .
ROMEO: Not the doctor lady ?
TIN CUP: Why not ?
ROMEO: You ca n't ask advice about the woman you 're trying to hose from the woman you 're trying to hose !
TIN CUP: Hose ? ! Hose ? ! Get your mouth outta the gutter ! This is a matter of the heart !
MOLLY: I know I know wait in there .
TIN CUP: I need therapy .
MOLLY: Obviously .
TIN CUP: What do I do ? I mean to do it therapy I mean , how do I start doing it .
MOLLY: In parlance you might understand , just kick back and let the Big Dog eat . He sighs and plunges in .
TIN CUP: Okay , okay , let 'er rip Suppose there 's this guy . He 's standing on the shore of a big , wide river . And the river 's fulla all manner of disaster , like alligators and piranhas and currents and eddies , and most people wo n't even go down there to dip a toe . But on the other side of the river 's a million dollars , and on this side of the rive there 's a rowboat . I guess my question 's this What would possess the guy on shore to swim for it ?
MOLLY: He 's an idiot .
TIN CUP: No . He 's a hell of a swimmer , see . His problem 's more like why 's he always got ta rise to the challenge ?
MOLLY: He 's a juvenile idiot .
TIN CUP: You do n't understand what I mean y the river .
MOLLY: We 're talking about you and what you like to call your inne demons , Roy , that human frailty you like to blather about , not some mytho-poetic metaphor you come up with in a feeble and transparent effort to do yourself credit .
TIN CUP: Y'mean you 're gon na make me feel lousy ? I came here to feel bette what kinda therapy is this ?
MOLLY: You do n't have any inner demons . What you have is inner crapola , inner debris garbage , loose wires , horseshit in staggering amounts .
TIN CUP: I ai n't just some jerk driving- ange pro who drinks too much ooze and eats too few vegetables .
MOLLY: You 're being defensive cut to the chase and tell me why you 're here .
TIN CUP: Well I 'm smitten with a woman .
MOLLY: That 's good . Is she smitten with you ?
TIN CUP: Not yet .
MOLLY: Have you asked her out ?
TIN CUP: She 's seeing a guy . I do n't know how serious it is , but the guy 's a eal horse 's ass , in my opinion
MOLLY: If you shared your heart with this woman maybe asked her out to dinner then it would force these issues out in the open .
TIN CUP: I 'm afraid she 'll say no .
MOLLY: Ahh so what you 're saying is that all your speeches about swimming across the shark infested waters are really just about you golf game not about you personal life .
TIN CUP: Christ , I did n't know we were gon na get into my personal life !
MOLLY: This is therapy !
TIN CUP: Well , jeez , I know , but I did n't think it was that kind of therapy
MOLLY: What were you expecting ? Ann Landers ?
TIN CUP: Yeah .
MOLLY: Look , it 's rather simple . Those isks that you love to take on the golf course , the risks you talk so passionately and poetically about you need to apply those risks to your personal life with the same passion .
TIN CUP: I should ask this woman out .
MOLLY: Yes !
TIN CUP: I should risk coming right ove the top and snap-hooking it out of ounds left .
MOLLY: Yes !
TIN CUP: Risk hitting it a little thin and
MOLLY: For Godsakes , Roy , that 's enough !
TIN CUP: Right . Sorry .
MOLLY: S'okay Look , just walk up to this woman , wherever she is , look her in the eye with those big beautiful green eyes of yours , let down your guard and do n't try to be smooth or cool or whatever just be honest and take the risk you can do it !
TIN CUP: Dr. Griswold I think I 'm in
MOLLY: What ? !
TIN CUP: From the moment I first saw you I knew I was through with bar girls and strippers and motorcycle chicks , and when you started talking I was smitten and I 'm smitten more every day I think about you and the fact that you know I 'm full of crapola only makes you more attractive to me because usually I can ullshit people but I ca n't ullshit you and in addition , most women I 'm thinking about how to get into their pants from Day One but with you I 'm just thinking about how to get into your heart Molly was clue-less . She just stares .
MOLLY: My God
TIN CUP: Stunned , eh ? So what about dinne and we can talk about ` us ' and if we have a future and how to drop that horse 's ass boyfriend of yours
MOLLY: Roy , slow down
TIN CUP: Hey ! I just hit a eight degree driver off a cart path here , I 'm staring eagle in the face
MOLLY: This is a terrible mistake !
TIN CUP: I 'm acting from the heart so I ca n't make a mistake ? ! Right ?
MOLLY: Wrong . Aw , shit I am one horrible shrink jeez I did n't know you were talking about me .
TIN CUP: Would your advice have been different ? She 's frustrated and at a loss for words .
MOLLY: Session 's over . You better leave .
TIN CUP: I 'm gon na qualify for the U.S. Open and kick your boyfriend 's ass .
MOLLY: Please leave .
TIN CUP: Whatever you think of me , you should know that your boyfriend hates old people , children , and dogs . He exits . She just sits there .
ROMEO: How 'd it go with the doctor lady , oss ?
TIN CUP: If she was a par three , I 'd ' a made a nine .
ROMEO: Stroke and distance , eh ?
TIN CUP: Dollar bills
CLINT: What 's he saying ?
ROMEO: Dollar bills . His divots got to look like dollar bills . 'Course Moe Norman hits divots like bacon strips 'cuz he come over the top , ut that 's gettin ' too technical for you .
CLINT: See that , boys ? He 's hitting dollar bills . Tightening his game .
TIN CUP: You perverts did that for me ?
JOSE: We believe in you , man .
EARL: And if you get past the local qualifier , we gon na sponsor you .
TIN CUP: Thanks , boys a man could n't have better friends . Now move the hell back and shut the fuck up . You 're messing up my concentration .
MOLLY: God , you 've got a beautiful swing
TIN CUP: And big , beautiful green eyes I 'm a beautiful guy .
MOLLY: I came here to apologize .
TIN CUP: For what ?
MOLLY: Well , I counseled you , you did exactly what I said , and I just poured cold water over you effort . I did n't get it . I 'm a terrible shrink , probably I should 've never got out of real estate actually I should never have left Ohio for that cowboy in Armarillo have you ever been to Amarillo ?
TIN CUP: A cowboy ?
MOLLY: It 's not as romantic when you 're actually with one a wrangler , y'know so of course the oil man in Dallas looked great afte that I do n't know what I was thinking That 's when I went to the gulf and ended up in , well , trailer sales and then all those condos in Corpus Christi the ottom fell outta the market and I needed a new gig
TIN CUP: A new gig ?
MOLLY: Therapy . I took all the classes .
TIN CUP: I got a little carried away , I guess . I shoulda just layed up , made my par , and moved on .
MOLLY: Look , I want to propose something as long as you understand this is professional we 're not going out together
TIN CUP: Tee it up .
MOLLY: I can help you with the mental aspects of the game . You 've got Romeo to be your swing doctor , I can be your head doctor .
TIN CUP: But you said you were a lousy shrink ?
MOLLY: Well , yeah I 'll improve .
TIN CUP: I got no money to pay for you .
MOLLY: I 'll trade my services for golf lessons and help you through the qualifying . If you get into the Open , well , you 're on your own .
TIN CUP: You 'll be with David .
MOLLY: Yeah
ROMEO: How ya feelin ' , boss ?
TIN CUP: I 'm feelin ' like par 's a bad score , podnuh fifty-eight 's within the realm !
ROMEO: Jesus , the doctor lady 's here
TIN CUP: Did n't I tell ya ? She 's gon na be your guru partner . You handle my swing mechanics and she handles my ain mechanics .
ROMEO: Long as you keep your dick out of it
TIN CUP: Me an ' the 'big guy ' have an understanding . He 's gon na lie low till I get in the Open then then
ROMEO: The Big Dog 'll eat ?
TIN CUP: The Big Dog 'll hunt , that 's fo sure
ROMEO: Looks like we partners , Dr. Molly
MOLLY: I just have to help him keep his head on straight
ROMEO: If you can , you be the first .
MOLLY: He does have the occasional tendency towards self-destruction it seems .
ROMEO: It ai n't occasional and it ai n't no tendency it 's a fact of life that he gon na blow sky high , it 's just a matter of when and how fast can the pieces be put back together . Behind that twinkle in his eyes is nitroglycerin . Tin Cup waves and motions to his team .
TIN CUP: Quiet in the gallery ! A man 's trying to do his job .
MOLLY: I find him mildly attractive when he 's obnoxious and arrogant like this
ROMEO: Good . 'Cause it 's his best side
TIN CUP: Dollar bills
ROMEO: They bugging you , boss I can shut 'em up ?
TIN CUP: The way I 'm swinging today ,
ROMEO: I think two iron 's safer .
TIN CUP: I said I want the Big Dog .
ROMEO: Tight par five , out of bounds left you do n't want to hit driver .
TIN CUP: I 'm not going left of those trees . I 'm going over those trees with a little draw . That way I get home in two . That way I 'm putting for eagle .
ROMEO: You do n't need eagle to qualify ! You need to get used to playing smart no mistakes wins the Open .
TIN CUP: Qualify ? I want the course ecord ! Now gim me the lumber !
ROMEO: You not going to listen to me ? You do n't care I 'm trying to help ? You think I 'm full of shit ?
TIN CUP: I think I 'm gon na get penalized for slow play if you do n't give me that fucking driver .
ROMEO: You a head case , boss , always were , always will be .
TIN CUP: Then let 's ask the head doctor . Dr. Griswold ? Dr. Griswold , should I hit the Big Dog or the two ? Suddenly an OFFICIAL steps forward .
P.G.A. OFFICIAL: Soliciting shot selection advice is a two-stroke penalty .
MOLLY: Trust your feelings , Roy .
TIN CUP: Ha ! Gim me the driver and shut up .
ROMEO: Go ahead . Hit the driver .
TIN CUP: I changed my mind . Gim me the three wood .
ROMEO: You ca n't clear the dogleg with a three wood .
TIN CUP: Wan na bet ?
MOLLY: Is this normal behavior for him ?
EARL: The word 'normal ' and him do n't collide in the same sentence too often . She watches in amazement as
TIN CUP: Sometimes I catch that three a little thin
ROMEO: No , boss , I 'm tired my life 's too short to spend it watching you fall apart . I done it too many times . Romeo turns and starts walking away .
TIN CUP: What 's this ? You 're quitting ? First sign of adversity , you 're quitting ? Anyone want to bet me I ca n't pa in with a seven iron ? Doc ? Take the bet ?
MOLLY: Roy just shut up and hit the all .
TIN CUP: An easy game , this golf
CLINT: You the man , Tin Cup !
TIN CUP: Thanks , boys , what'ya think was my est shot the seven iron on twelve , the seven iron on fourteen , or maybe it was the unker shot on eighteen which , to my recollection was a seven iron ?
EARL: You definitely the man !
TIN CUP: How 'd I do , Doc ?
MOLLY: You failed miserably .
TIN CUP: What ? ! I parred the back nine with a seven iron , I qualified fo the regionals , I
MOLLY: Your job is not just to qualify for the Open , it 's to prepare fo the Open . My job is to help you prepare .
TIN CUP: You said to 'trust my feelings ' !
MOLLY: I did n't know you felt like eaking all the clubs in you ag .
CLINT: He did n't break the seven !
EARL: He smoked that seven , brother
MOLLY: From what I understand , the U.S. Open is the most difficult golf tournament in the world played under the most difficult circumstances with the greatest players winning it means controlling yourself , managing your emotions , staying cool , not getting in a pissing contest with your caddie who , incidentally , quit .
TIN CUP: He always quits , he always comes ack .
MOLLY: Nonetheless , from the mental aspect which is my domain you have regressed and are fumbling somewhere between delusion and denial .
TIN CUP: 'Regression , delusion , denial ' ? You got ta use all this psychological language ?
MOLLY: I 'm a psychologist .
TIN CUP: I shot 65 parred the backside with a seven iron .
SIMMS: Why ?
MOLLY: That 's the question why ? Silence .
CLINT: 'Cause he broke all his othe clubs .
EARL: Snapped 'em in two even the putter .
SIMMS: Jesus , Roy , I 'm on your side here . We go way back I hope you get into the Open , but if you do n't play under control , you 'll get slaughtered . Good players shoot 82 in the Open . You ca n't always go for it .
TIN CUP: Swear to God , Doc , this guy is not who you think .
CLINT: It 's a well-known fact that if a camera 's not on him , he treats old people and children like dirt .
EARL: And dogs .
TIN CUP: Yeah , do n't forget the dogs .
MOLLY: I think we should go , David .
SIMMS: I think so
TIN CUP: You ever shoot par with a seven iron ?
SIMMS: It never occurred to me to try . C'mon , let 's go . The car 's ove here .
TIN CUP: I 'll bet you a thousand dollars against my car that I can beat you in any game any game , you name it with a seven iron .
SIMMS: This is ridiculous .
TIN CUP: You a coward ? You gon na lay up the way you did at the Masters last year ?
REGULARS: Chickie , chickie , chickie
SIMMS: Any game , I name it ?
MOLLY: Oh , come on , David
SIMMS: I just want to teach him a lesson .
MOLLY: Why do men insist on measuring their dicks ?
TIN CUP: Awright , awright ! Let 's measure ,
MOLLY: For God sakes , I was n't being literal ! David , let 's go .
SIMMS: Molly , trust me on this one . Call it part of his mental preparation for the Open , where the rough is deep , the greens are slick , and the nerves are shattered . I 'll take the bet .
MOLLY: Oh , jeez
TIN CUP: Awright ! What 's the game ?
SIMMS: One swing each . Who can hit the longest seven iron
TIN CUP: It 's a lock ! I hit the seven like John Daly hits a three !
SIMMS: Fine with me .
MOLLY: You guys are really being childish
SIMMS: Molly , leave this one to me .
TIN CUP: Dr. Griswold , I know what I 'm doing .
CLINT: Them signs are at least thirty yards farther that ball musta gone 220
TIN CUP: That ball 's about 2-2-7 toed it a bit but it 'll do
REGULARS: Nearly 230 with a seven ! Pureed it , baby , he pureed it ! Tin Cup hands Simms the seven iron .
TIN CUP: Take a minute to limber up , fine with me
SIMMS: Do n't need to .
TIN CUP: Take your jacket off ?
SIMMS: No , no , I 'm fine .
TIN CUP: You 're gon na need to muscle up , ig guy give it the old steroid jerk
REGULARS: What the hell you doin ' ? Wha 's this ?
CLINT: You the man , Roy
EARL: You definitely the man
SAMMANTHA: Hey , honey
TIN CUP: Hey , honey
DOREEN: I heard you qualified for the Regionals why you so down ?
TIN CUP: I broke my clubs do n't ask why , my caddie 's pissed off at me , I lost my wheels in a sucker bet , and my shrink thinks I 'm a fool 'cause I probably am
DOREEN: You 're seeing a therapist ? !
TIN CUP: Yeah , what 's wrong with that ?
DOREEN: Only way you 'd ever go into therapy was if the shrink was a doll and you were trying to get her into the rack
TIN CUP: You 're so shallow . The Good Doctor and I are dealing with my egression and denial
DOREEN: Oh , Tin Cup , what a crock . You got a hard-on .
GUY: You ` Tin Cup ' ? Won the Local with a seven iron ?
TIN CUP: That 's me .
GUY: McAvoy ? The Tin Cup McAvoy ?
DOREEN: There 's only one thank God
TIN CUP: Yeah . You looking for a game ?
GUY: No , but I 'd sure like to show you my grip
DOREEN: How long have you been seeing this ` Good Doctor ' ?
TIN CUP: Excuse me , Dor ' , the man 's having trouble with his grip
GUY: See , I used to play a real weak grip . But you look at Couples , he 's got a left hand way ove here Tin Cup glances at the guy 's grip .
TIN CUP: No , grip it like this , so you 're holding on with the last two fingers of your left hand . The Guy nudges the COWBOY next to him .
GUY: See that ? Tin Cup McAvoy says you grip a golf club like this , with these two fingers .
DOREEN: Roy ? Roy ? Tin Cup ? Hello ?
TIN CUP: The grip and address are about 90 percent of the golf swing , so pay attention here
COWBOY: When you 're done with him , can I ask you about my club position at address ?
SAMMANTHA: Am I doing something wrong ?
DOREEN: No , honey , you ai n't but a healthy woman 's only got two choices in this world of ours Either fall in love with anothe woman or take up golf .
TIN CUP: Now the stronger right-hand grip can help ya draw the ball , which I plan to do at the Regionals next week in Tulsa just shift the hand over a little it blah , blah , blah
CLINT: We get through the next 36 holes and we in the Open !
EARL: I got the yips and I ai n't even teeing it up
TIN CUP: Nothing to worry about , boys
JOSE: But you ai n't got Romeo ?
TIN CUP: Do n't need him till the Open he 'll be back .
CLINT: But you do n't got the doctor lady ?
TIN CUP: Oh no , I got her . Right here . He holds up a tape cassette .
EARL: What 's on it ?
TIN CUP: A little James Taylor , little George Jones , little Kahlil Gibran , little this , little that and a lotta the voice of the smartest chick I ever met .
EARL: The good doctor herself
CLINT: Can we hear it or is it personal ?
TIN CUP: Since when is therapy personal , eh ?
EARL: I think three under will qualify . You need birdie . I could shit .
TIN CUP: A little more confidence there , Earl
EARL: I wish Romeo was here . I ai n't cut out to do this . I 'm a spectator by nature . An observer . I 'm a
TIN CUP: Shut up and hand me the Big Dog .
EARL: You got it .
TIN CUP: The Force is with me , pods
EARL: Looks straight to me .
TIN CUP: Straight ? ! Thing 's a rolle coaster breaks four ways and dies at the hole you 're blind !
EARL: Actually , I am blind 20-60 in one eye and that 's the good eye
TIN CUP: I got a blind caddie just hold the stick , Earl and be sure to pull it out
MARSHAL: Are you okay ?
TIN CUP: Yeah , yeah I 'm flying solo now
MARSHAL: What ?
TIN CUP: I got ta make this putt .
MARSHAL: Obviously . Tin Cup stares endlessly at the long putt .
TIN CUP: just pick the line , feel the speed bad timing , doc , Jesus
ROMEO: I knew you had the hots for her .
TIN CUP: What 's this ? Garbo speaks ? Of course I have the hots for her and I 'm doing a damn good job of keeping things platonic and professional till I kick Simms ' ass and show her I ai n't who she thinks I am because , in fact , I am who she thinks I am but if I win the Open I wo n't be . Romeo stares back at that curious logic .
ROMEO: Well , I do n't think her nor me no the God of Golf his self can keep you from blowing up in the Open
TIN CUP: I made it this far ! I just got to hold it together for 72 more
ROMEO: There 's a lotta triple bogeys out there waiting to grab your ass .
TIN CUP: You 're complaining again ! Romeo 's ack ! Whining , bitching , pissed off you 're my man ! Silence . Some chagrin .
ROMEO: You did n't fall in love with Earl to be your caddie ?
TIN CUP: He was a wheezing heart attack waiting to happen cost me three strokes a side I carried my bag the last fou holes . I love ol ' Earl but I need you .
ROMEO: You do n't love me ?
TIN CUP: I love you , too , God damn it !
ROMEO: As much as Earl ?
TIN CUP: I do n't know ! Yes , yes , as much as Earl More than Earl !
ROMEO: Am I special ?
TIN CUP: If you can remove the sexual connotations and overlay a golf theme , Romeo I am your Juliet . Romeo ponders it all .
ROMEO: Muy bien , Julietta . In that case I am your caddy once again .
TIN CUP: Podnuh . They shake hands .
ROMEO: You got it bad , do n't ya ?
TIN CUP: Somethin ' about that chick
ROMEO: Be sure to do that in the Open .
TIN CUP: Romeo !
ROMEO: I 'm watching .
TIN CUP: It ai n't no chili dipper .
ROMEO: Yeah , boss , you got the 'S ' word .
TIN CUP: What am I doing wrong ?
ROMEO: Shanks are like a virus they just show up . Nobody can figure 'em out .
TIN CUP: Romes ! Something 's terribly wrong . What 's your guess ? !
ROMEO: It 's the woman .
TIN CUP: I thought you said it was a virus ?
ROMEO: A woman can have the same effect .
TIN CUP: What do I do ?
ROMEO: Keep swinging
CLINT: Never thought it would happen
EARL: The shanks is for us mortals , not
JOSE: Esta muy feo muy , muy feo
TIN CUP: Y'know why they named this game 'golf ' ? 'Cause the words 'fuck ' and 'shit ' were already taken ! A CAR HORN HONKS All heads turn to see
DOREEN: Hiya , fellas !
TIN CUP: What is this ? Everybody like to watch a train wreck ? !
DOREEN: He 's in one of his pleasant moods , I see
ROMEO: He 's got the shanks . We got the makings of a Greek tragedy here .
DOREEN: Quit whining and get over here . We 've got something for you . Tin Cup drags his sorry ass to the group .
TIN CUP: Unless it 's a 'swing thought , ' I 'm not interested
DOREEN: We 're here to sponsor you in the
TIN CUP: But I got the shanks
DOREEN: Yeah , and you obviously still have a hard-on for the doctor chick your face is all screwed up and tight like you have n't been laid in awhile
TIN CUP: Is it really that obvious ?
DOREEN: It 's not a good look for you . Roy , your heart is not the only organ you wear on your sleeve . There 's a certain , vulgar appeal to your transparency .
CLINT: C'mon , Tin Cup , we 're trying to make you a presentation
TIN CUP: Awright , awright
DOREEN: I got the Golden Tassel to sponso you at the Open .
TIN CUP: You expect me to pack that around ?
ROMEO: I 'm carrying the bag .
DOREEN: It 's worth four hundred dollars endorsement money to you
EARL: See , Dewey got you First State Banking of Salome , and Clint got you Short-Haul Trucking and I got you Brink and Brown sanitation
TIN CUP: I 'm being sponsored by a sewage disposal system ?
EARL: We call it human resources management , Roy , please
JOSE: I 've got Wally 's Smokehouse for ya kind of a nice sign
DEWEY: And since I could n't get the post office to come aboard , me and my girl friend Muriel 's gon na buy a fan club patch you can put anywhere you want .
TIN CUP: I 'm supposed to wear this shit ?
JOSE: This shit is us , man . You ca n't win without us .
DOREEN: You 're the pride of Salome !
TIN CUP: Hell , I wo n't even make the cut !
DOREEN: What happened to your confidence ?
ROMEO: He 's shanking his love life so he 's shanking the golf ball .
DOREEN: Must be true love .
ROMEO: He 's a goner .
TIN CUP: Look , everybody , this is great . I 'm sorry I 'm acting so pathetic ut my swing 's never abandoned me efore . I just need a little time to work it out .
EARL: Anything you want
CLINT: Give him some room , boys
TIN CUP: Maybe it 's my grip maybe I 'm opening up too soon too late coming over the top no , dropping underneath Oh , sweet Jesus , why have you abandoned me ?
DOREEN: He 's trying to talk to God . It 's time for us to go .
ROMEO: You want me to stay , boss ?
TIN CUP: I need to be alone .
ROMEO: You got it .
MOLLY: Roy ? Anybody home ?
TIN CUP: Aarghh
MOLLY: Roy
TIN CUP: Dr. Griswold A moment of pathetic silence , then Molly starts laughing He is destroyed .
MOLLY: I 'm sorry , I just
TIN CUP: Some of this shit might actually
MOLLY: Oh , Roy , Jesus Quoting yourself , 'It is the paraphernalia for lost and desperate souls . '
TIN CUP: Well , God damn a lost and desperate soul stands before you . I assume I have the confidentiality of doctor-client privilege in regards to this outfit ?
MOLLY: Of course you do . What happened ?
TIN CUP: I got the shanks .
MOLLY: Are you taking penicillin ?
TIN CUP: It ca n't be treated ! It 's much worse than whatever you thought it was . There 's a glitch in my swing .
MOLLY: So it 's in Romeo 's department ?
TIN CUP: He thinks it 's your department says it 's a head thing .
MOLLY: Oh . Well . I just came over to congratulate you on the regionals and return your car David says he does n't want it , just wanted to make a point with you But I suppose we could have a therapy session right here and now
TIN CUP: I do n't want therapy . I want you .
MOLLY: Roy I got ta get some air
TIN CUP: Look at me Well , not right at the moment ut listen to me . You 're with the wrong guy . I 'm the right guy . Everyone tells me my face is all screwed up tight as a drum 'cause I 've been crazy about you from the day you showed up wearing this stupid stuff and the whole damn thing has both inspired me to get here on the verge of greatness yet it 's also caused me to get the shanks which could humiliate me in front of a zillion people . Such is life . So dump that phony astard and come to the Open in my corner you can delay you omantic urges , which I know are lurking in there among the excess of brain cells you possess until the appropriate time Tell me you 're not at least moderately attracted to me .
MOLLY: You have moments .
TIN CUP: Tell me which ones are my moments and I 'll try to duplicate them .
MOLLY: This is a moment . You look great .
TIN CUP: Now ? !
MOLLY: Utterly exposed , completely vulnerable , the inner child trying to get out .
TIN CUP: My inner child needs spanking .
MOLLY: You always liked that part about saddling up , the smell of leathe
TIN CUP: C'mon , let 's have a drink . Call it therapy . Charge me 75 an hour . Little Cuervo , little Freud She 's thinking about it .
MOLLY: Naw I got ta go . Oh , I do n't have a car , I need a ride .
TIN CUP: I know a spot along the river 's great to watch the sunset ?
MOLLY: Not tonight .
TIN CUP: 'Not tonight ' means maybe some other night ?
MOLLY: I did n't mean it like that .
TIN CUP: Consciously you did n't mean it like that but how about unconsciously , you 're the expert , did you mean it unconsciously ?
MOLLY: Unconsciously , Roy , I do n't have a clue what I 'm talking about .
TIN CUP: I feel we 're making progress .
MOLLY: I do too . But I have no idea what it 's progress towards
TIN CUP: Put your money on me , Doc , the odds are fabulous and God knows I 'm overdue He drives away , and we stay
ROMEO: You got to relax , boss
TIN CUP: Goin ' to the U.S. Open with the shanks . Gon na be chili dipping my way around the course on worldwide television sure , relax .
ROMEO: I 'm gon na get rid of them shanks for ya . No hay problema .
TIN CUP: Molly and I are circling each other I can feel it
ROMEO: She the enemy , boss .
TIN CUP: Naw
ROMEO: Well she wakin ' up with the enemy same thing .
TIN CUP: Tell me something , Romes the absolute truth you think I can go 72 holes without falling apart . Romeo keeps driving , pretends not to hear .
ROMEO: I do n't know , boss , I just do n't know .
TIN CUP: I bet this is the first Winnebago they ever saw here
ROMEO: Yeah and the first Mexican
SECURITY GUARD: Yes ?
ROMEO: Como esta , amigo . I have with me one of the legendary ball strikers in the history of golf The Security Guard strains to see in .
SECURITY GUARD: Who 's that ? Mr. Crenshaw ? That you ? Mr. Price , Mr. Norman ? No ?
TIN CUP: Roy 'Tin Cup ' McAvoy . Representing the great American Southwest .
SECURITY GUARD: Do we have a McCormack on the list .
ROMEO: McAvoy Roy McAvoy he 's a legend !
SECURITY GUARD: We got over 150 legends in this tournament . Sorry .
ROMEO: Police ?
TIN CUP: There 's a mistake here , fellas !
COP: We 'll throw your ass in jail right now , pal there 's a lotta lunatics here and we do n't take chances
SIMMS: What 's the problem here ?
SECURITY GUARD: This clown says he 's in the Open
TIN CUP: Hiya , David nice sweater .
SECURITY GUARD: He 's not on the list . Simms takes the clipboard with the list .
SIMMS: Hiya , Roy welcome to the big leagues Here ya go , Charlie , his name 's ight here . They spelled your name wrong easy mistake with a total unknown .
SECURITY GUARD: Let him in .
TIN CUP: Which way to the practice range ?
SECURITY GUARD: He said he was a 'legend ' ?
SIMMS: Oh he is he 's a very big name at a driving range in Salome , Texas They all have a good laugh , and
ROMEO: Look ! Right there ! Fred Couples and Ray Floyd !
TIN CUP: Look at these balls . Brand new Titleists . Lookit 'em , every one a brand new Titleist . Sneak a few in the bag when you get a chance . We swipe enough free shit we might even pay fo this fiasco .
ROMEO: You think it would be inappropriate to ask Ray Floyd fo an autograph ?
TIN CUP: I think it 's a dead giveaway , Romes but if I still got the shanks we 're gon na be found out eal fast
ROMEO: Hit the seven iron . You neve miss the seven
TIN CUP: Good thought , Pods
ROMEO: A little thin , Boss .
TIN CUP: A little fucking thin ? ! I still got the shanks ! Everybody 's watching ! Christ , Simms is here
ROMEO: Maybe we should work on putting . Ya ca n't shank a putt .
TIN CUP: If you 're the Mexican Mac O'Grady , Romes , you got ta figure out why I 'm still shanking the ball . What 's the problem ? I 'm catching it on the hosel , right ? Moving my head ? I 'm laying off it , I 'm pronating , I 'm supinating , I 'm clearing too early , I 'm clearing too late , I 'm off plane , I ai n't dropping in oh , God , my swing feels like an unfolding lawn chair .
ROMEO: You got a virus in your brain . I
TIN CUP: Anything . Kill me now !
ROMEO: Put all your change in your right pocket .
TIN CUP: I 'll look like a fool .
ROMEO: What you think you look like hitting those squirrelly chili peppers up Freddy Couples ' ass , eh ? Do what I say or I quit .
TIN CUP: Okay , okay
ROMEO: Perfect now hit a seven iron into that tree over there . You 're eady .
TIN CUP: How 'd I do that ?
ROMEO: You ai n't thinking about shanking , you ai n't thinking about the doctor lady , you ai n't thinking period . You just lookin ' like a fool and hittin ' it pure you natural state .
TIN CUP: Fuck you .
ROMEO: You cured .
TIN CUP: That 's it ?
ROMEO: That 's it . Your brain was getting in the way .
TIN CUP: That 's rarely been a problem . What now ?
ROMEO: Well , I should recommend you go work on your short game but I think it 's better if you go get drunk instead .
TIN CUP: Get drunk ?
ROMEO: Yeah . You always play better when you 're wasted . Tin Cups stares at the swami , and
TIN CUP: It 's three in the morning , Romes , what time I tee off ?
ROMEO: Seven-o-five first group off Keep drinking , keep dancing
TIN CUP: That 's four hours from now ?
ROMEO: You 're drinking till five c'mon , c'mon , have another Get you in shape
TIN CUP: No time for a bucket , eh ?
ROMEO: Almost missed the starting time trying to get you off the floor , oss . You do n't handle the hooch like you used to
TIN CUP: No , I 've learned my lesson . Gon na play it safe , smart , conservative . Fairways and greens . Hand me the two iron .
ROMEO: You sure ?
TIN CUP: Thought of the day is ` be humble . '
ROMEO: Eighty-three . Well , you humble now .
TIN CUP: Eleven bogeys and seven pars . I did n't make a three . I did n't make one goddam three all day .
ROMEO: You were n't trying to make threes . You were trying to avoid making thirteen .
TIN CUP: I was hungover !
ROMEO: Maybe that was a coaching error on my part .
TIN CUP: Thanks , amigo
TIN CUP: The Anti-Christ shoots 67 , you elieve it ?
ROMEO: Ol ' Anti-Christ got a hot putter
TIN CUP: What ? It 's about cheating and acism and bullshit !
ROMEO: Easy , boss
SIMMS: So tomorrow I 'll just go out there and try to make some good swings and , Lord willing , maybe I can put up another good number . Thank you .
NANTZ: Thank you , David Simms , a illiant opening round 67 to take the lead .
FANS: David ! David ! Over here !

PLAYER #1: Helluva round , Dave !
SIMMS: Got lucky out there
PLAYER #2: Great start , Simmsy
SIMMS: Hey , Tin Cup heard you put a monster number up there
TIN CUP: Coulda been worse A small bar crowd is enjoying Simms ' taunts .
SIMMS: I played in the Pro-Am with some asshole movie star shot 82 here once how did a great ball- striker like you , a ` legend , ' manage to shoot an 83 ?
TIN CUP: I missed a four foot putt on the eighteen for an 82 , that 's how
SIMMS: It ai n't like playing some muni track in Brownsville , is it ? A voice interrupts .
MOLLY: Does , ` integrity , tradition , and honor ' include kicking a man when he 's down ?
SIMMS: Oh , Mol ' , this is just guy stuff , ar talk , part of the game no offense , right , Cup ?
MOLLY: This man still has a lot of good golf shots in his system
TIN CUP: Molly , it 's okay , go away I do n't need any attention right
MOLLY: David , I 'll bet you a hundred dollars right now that Roy here can hit a ball from right here to through that door to the patio
TIN CUP: Molly , please
MOLLY: And give me a vodka tonic with a twist
SIMMS: Molly , really , this is n't dignified
MOLLY: Roy ?
TIN CUP: I wanta go back to Texas
MOLLY: What about the river , the piranha , the immortality ? All that ullshit ? You gon na drag your ass home with an 83 ? In fact , two hundred says he can hit it through that door , over the patio , into the river , and make that pelican fly off that post . Everyone strains to look
SIMMS: This is ridiculous But Romeo 's sizing it up .
ROMEO: You got that shot , Pods , hood the seven , turn it over , start it low , ight to left
MOLLY: I 'm not leaving till one of you men starts acting in a manly fashion .
SIMMS: Let 's just get this over with . One ball , one swing , one gull .
MOLLY: Roy ?
ROMEO: You the man .
TIN CUP: One swing ? Four to one odds .
SIMMS: I 'll make it ten to one . Stick it up your ass . I 'm leading the Open .
MOLLY: Now we 're talking ! Manly men !
TIN CUP: Kind of a thin lie
SIMMS: Beats all that deep rough you were in today
ROMEO: Fore in the grill ! Fore on the patio ! You 're the legend , boss
TIN CUP: What is this all about ?
MOLLY: Shut up and hit the ball . McCORD The Ledge still has to be thinking about that brutal , ego-sapping , manhood-robbing eighty-three he uried himself under yesterday . I mean , that 's just an avalanche of golf swings , a landslide , a pyroclastic flow
TIN CUP: Dollar bills
ROMEO: Stiff , baby , stiff !
SIMMS: I 'm outta here . You 're all nuts .
MOLLY: I musta been blind thinking you were worth a shit , Simmsy ! Drinks on me , boys ! Helluva shot , Roy !
TIN CUP: Actually I thinned it a little o that pelican 'd be flying around with a Titleist up his ass
MOLLY: No , no , no you were great
TIN CUP: Tempo is everything
MOLLY: Perfection 's unobtainable
TIN CUP: Mighta rushed it on the downswing
MOLLY: Come over the top a little
TIN CUP: Yeah well , as Walter Hagen once said 'Sex and golf are the only two things you can be bad at and still enjoy '
MOLLY: Let 's take a mulligan and tee it up again
ROMEO: You guys done yet ? This is no time for a marathon The rain keeps coming down .
NANTZ: The sun is struggling to come out , the course is drying up , and in case you 're just joining us , the leaders have just reached the ninth hole because of delayed starting times David Simms is clinging to a one shot lead over Peter Jacobsen ut the real story is out on sixteen where a driving range pro who shot an opening eighty-three is making a run at perhaps the most legendary round of golf in Open history , Johnny Miller 's sixty-three at Oakmont Ben Wright is in the tower at
DEWEY: They said on the radio he was ten under
EVERYONE: Shhhh ! ! !
EARL: He 's shooting the lowest round ever !
CLINT: And eighteen 's a par five . A irdie there , he shoots sixty !
DOREEN: We got ta go , boys . We got ta get us on a Continental Trailways and find this damn place !
VENTURI: McAvoy 's hit another big drive , ut this is not a shot he wants to get aggressive with
ROMEO: Two-sixty to carry , Roy . You got to lay up , man . I do n't care how good you swinging . You got to lay
VENTURI: His adrenalin 's gotten the bette of him , Jim . If he lays up he takes bogey out of play .
SUMMERALL: Well , every golf fan in America is pulling for him .
TIN CUP: Nope .
ROMEO: Carry , honey ! Please ! Carry !
TIN CUP: What the hell . You ride 'er till she bucks you or you do n't ride at all . I can save par from here . Tin Cup hits a wedge to within five feet .
ROMEO: Up an ' down
REPORTER #1: How do you go from shooting an eighty-three one day to a record- eaking sixty-two the next ?
TIN CUP: Well , it was n't from clean living
REPORTER #1: If you had to do it again , would you still go for the green on eighteen ?
TIN CUP: Yeah . And I 'll go for it tomorrow and I 'll go for it Sunday , cuz I did n't come here to play for no second .
VENTURI: It 's the same shot he knocked in the water yesterday . And the thing for him to do right now is to tune out the gallery , rein in his emotions , and forget what he said in yesterday 's interview . He has to lay up .
TIN CUP: Gim me the three wood .
ROMEO: There 's wind up there .
TIN CUP: I know .
NANTZ: Well , he has n't shown an ounce of fear all day .
VENTURI: This is n't courage , Jim . This is inexperience , pure and simple .
TIN CUP: This is for Venturi , up there in the booth , thinking I should lay up Dollar bills
ROMEO: Roy
TIN CUP: What ?
ROMEO: It 's a water hazard . You go up there and take a drop . Try to save par like you did yesterday .
TIN CUP: You 're right . What the hell was I thinking ?
REPORTER #3: I 'm just trying to understand you thinking . You were in the same spot on eighteen yesterday without a headwind and you
TIN CUP: You do n't think I can knock it on from there ?
REPORTER #3: It seemed like a low-percentage shot .
TIN CUP: So am I ! Look at me . I 'm playing for Rio Grande Short-Haul Trucking , Brink and Brown Sanitation , First State Bank of Salome , Wally 's Smokehouse You think a guy like me bothers to think about the percentages ?
MOLLY: I 've got some money from the pelican bet why do n't we go somewhere fancy and celebrate get ready for the final round .
TIN CUP: Nothing to celebrate yet . Plus these are my people . I 'm a waffle house guy got ta stay in touch with that
ROMEO: Plus he needs his carbohydrates
TIN CUP: If the boys from Salome was in town this is where they 'd be
CLINT: The legend !
EARL: God damn , we been driving for two days to help you in the last round
JOSE: Saw the Winnebago outside we 're starving
DEWEY: Sixty-two ! Sixty-two !
TIN CUP: We 're home now !
ROMEO: You boys a sight for sore eyes . We so damn sick of guys in blazers and slacks that do n't wrinkle . It ai n't natural 'round here
DOREEN: Congratulations , Roy we 're with you all the way .
TIN CUP: Doreen , meet Dr. Griswold er , Molly my shrink
MOLLY: Ex-shrink . We 're sleeping together now so I ca n't be his therapist .
DOREEN: I knew it .
MOLLY: Knew what ?
DOREEN: Nothing , dear . Good luck . Say , I have a little extra cash why do n't we go somewhere fancy and celebrate y'know , kinda get
DEWEY: This is the Waffle House , Doreen
CURT: Hell , I been dreaming of waffles for 1800 miles
EARL: They got a waffle house in Odessa just about like this
JOSE: Odessa ? It 's in Midland , ai n't it ?
CLINT: No , it 's in Odessa .
TIN CUP: It just do n't get much better than this
ROMEO: You 're looking particularly lovely this evening the coif is extraordinary .
DOREEN: Why thank you Romeo .
MOLLY: You nervous about tomorrow ?
TIN CUP: Yeah , I 'm nervous . So 's everybody else . But I only got ta come and catch Simms . Sixty-seven guys got ta come and get me Silence . Except for the random snore .
MOLLY: Yes it will yes it will and it 's okay
DEWEY: We all are , but Earl 's the best .
MOLLY: What are the odds that Roy will win ?
EARL: Vegas has him at ten to one . They 're sure he 's gon na self-destruct .
MOLLY: Those sound good to me I want you to place a bet for me . Five thousand nine hundred dollars on Tin Cup to win . They stare nervously .
CURT: That 's your nestegg .
EARL: That 's a bad idea , honey we love him , but he 's gon na fuck- up
MOLLY: I said put it all on Roy . Got it ?
DEWEY: We ca n't let you
MOLLY: Boys
JACOBSEN: Looking a little tight , Ledge .
TIN CUP: Musta got too much sleep last night . How you choking ?
JACOBSEN: Just got one thought in my head . Ten under . That 's my number . Tin Cup looks up , amused by the gamesmanship .
TIN CUP: No one 's ever been ten under fo the Open , not even Nicklaus .
JACOBSEN: That 's right , Ledge . Not even Nicklaus .
SIMMS: Sorry , Roy , ca n't believe I did n't see you with all that high-priced endorsement crap you 're flaunting .
TIN CUP: That 's always been your problem , Dave . You do n't think about winning ; you just want to look good . Thing is , this ai n't a beauty pageant . And it ai n't a rain-shortened Quad Cities or a Greater Greensboro you can back into . This is you ' n me , pal . This is match-play , and this time you ai n't getting no three shots .
STARTER: With the honor in the final pairing , from Salome , Texas , Mr. Roy McAvoy .
TIN CUP: Fairways and greens , Dave and do n't forget to wave as I blow by .
SIMMS: You mean blow up ? Like you always do ? And Tin Cup moves to the tee .
TIN CUP: Do me a favor . Bet me a buck I do n't put it in the fairway .
ROMEO: I bet you a hundred .
TIN CUP: Okay , good . Puts things back in perspective .
ROMEO: Which way you going ?
SIMMS: Nice double , Roy .
TIN CUP: Just keep making pars , asshole .
SIMMS: I 'll take eighteen of 'em .
TIN CUP: And I will own you .
MOLLY: Oh no , Tin Cup ran it five feet past . How did he get the name 'Tin Cup ' ?
CLINT: Our boy 's in trouble ya think he 's chokin ' ?
EARL: Our boy do n't choke . He fucks up ut he do n't choke
BEN WRIGHT: This is disaster for McAvoy . After losing three shots to par in the first four holes , he should have just taken iron off the tee to get the ball in play . Does he have any shot at all , Gary McCord ?
TIN CUP: Fifty bucks says I knock it on with a seven iron .
NANTZ: That took balls
SIMMS: That 's just Roy being Roy . Just wait him out , Dave . Just make pars . Let him make the mistakes .
JACOBSEN: He 's making his run .
MOLLY: So why 'd you leave him ?
DOREEN: You ever dated a guy who actually elieves in soul mates ?
MOLLY: Actually , no .
DOREEN: He thinks he 's a tough guy , but he 's a hopeless romantic .
JACOBSEN: He 's throwing darts back there . We got ta make birdies , Squeaky , o we are playing for second .
TIN CUP: That 's right , Peter . You ' n me . That 's all there is .
FANS: Get in there ! Come on ! Go down !
EARL: He 's tied for the lead again ! And they 're running outta holes !
NANTZ: So it 's come down to the seventy- second hole of this great championship , and the skill and courage of three Texans who have dueled throughout the day for the chance to be crowned Open Champion Peter Jacobsen is on the fairway at 8 under , McAvoy at the 18th tee is tied at minus 8 , and David Simms trails by one
TIN CUP: Jacobsen 's laying up . You ai n't gon na have that luxury , Dave . Not if you play to win . He moves to the tee , and
NANTZ: McAvoy 's hit a perfect drive , Ken .
VENTURI: I 'm not sure that 's good news fo McAvoy . With his inexperience , the last thing he needs is an excuse to fool with that wate again today .
TIN CUP: I did n't catch it all .
ROMEO: Then you got to lay up .
TIN CUP: So birdie wins it .
ROMEO: Par to tie , birdie to win you lay up too , Roy . You can make irdie laying up .
TIN CUP: You know something , Romeo ? Eagle puts me ten under . No one 's eve finished an Open ten under , not even Nicklaus .
ROMEO: You do n't need an eagle . Birdie wins , par ties . Hit the lay up . Hole a wedge fo goddamn eagle .
TIN CUP: This is everything , ai n't it ? This is the choice it comes down to . This is our immortality
ROMEO: No time to be thinkin ' 'immortality , ' Cup time to be thinkin ' 7 iron .
DOREEN: Oh no . This is what always happens . He 's going for it .
MOLLY: Go for it !
DOREEN: No ! He just needs par to tie ! Tell him to lay up ! He listens to you !
MOLLY: Go for it , Roy ! Knock it on !
DOREEN: This is why we split up he always went for it
MOLLY: My problem is I 've never been with
DOREEN: Well , honey , he 's your guy .
NANTZ: Good Lord , he 's going for the green .
VENTURI: This could be tragic .
TIN CUP: One swing , Roy . One good swing . Dollar bills
MOLLY: You can still make par from up there
ROMEO: She 's right , Pods , a drop and a stroke , up and down par we 'll win it in sudden death .
TIN CUP: I nutted that thing . Little gust from the gods cost me
ROMEO: Helluva move you put on that sucker , now let 's get up there , take the drop , and make our par , tie Peter
TIN CUP: I can make this shot .
ROMEO: Not now .
TIN CUP: Now . Tin Cup throws another ball on the ground .
MOLLY: Take your drop and make your par ! Tin Cup addresses the ball .
VENTURI: I do n't believe this . He just took himself out of the tournament with that drop . He could have walked up to the hazard line , saved par with a wedge and forced a playoff with Jacobsen . Now he needs a miracle shot . McCORD Ken , I 'm right behind McAvoy here . And all he said to his caddie was I can make it across .
TIN CUP: Gim me another ball .
MOLLY: I ca n't believe he 's doing this .
DOREEN: I can , honey
MOLLY: He can blow the whole tournament !
DOREEN: It 's a miracle he lasted this long
CLINT: He done blew a gasket , boys
EARL: The wheels is definitely falling off now
JOSE: It was a miracle while it lasted
ROMEO: This is your last ball , man . If this gets wet , you disqualified .
TIN CUP: I can make it across . Tin Cup snatches the ball from Romeo 's hand .
VENTURI: This is the most painful thing I 've ever watched . McCORD Jim , this is the last ball he has in his bag . If he does n't finish the hole with it , he ca n't turn in a card . He 'll be disqualified . Venturi and Nantz cover their eyes .
MOLLY: You 're right , Roy , what the hell ! Let 'er rip !
DOREEN: You two are made for each other .
TIN CUP: Dollar bills
SIMMS: I got ta hand it to you , Roy . When you go down , you go down in flames .
TIN CUP: Someday you can tell you grandchildren you finished second in the U.S. Open just do n't tell 'em how .
MOLLY: Yes . A magnificent fool
TIN CUP: Some people do n't like West Texas ut I think it 's the most eautiful place on earth
MOLLY: It has its charms Y'know , by finishing in the top 15 at the Open you qualified to be in it next year
TIN CUP: Damn , I did n't know that
MOLLY: I 'm thinking with your game you should go back to the Qualifying School , try to get out on tour
TIN CUP: Then I would n't see you
MOLLY: Actually , I picked up a whole unch of new clients at the Open . Lotta guys on the tour said if I could do that much for you , imagine what I could do fo them
TIN CUP: There 's a lotta head cases out there , you could make a bundle
MOLLY: And sleep in the Winnebago at night
TIN CUP: Y'know a man goes through what I 've gone through , he 's supposed to learn something . I 'm trying to figure out what I learned . Did I learn anything ?
MOLLY: You 're learning some discipline and self-control
TIN CUP: And that there 's a time in life to play it safe
MOLLY: That 's great , Roy and I 'm learning how to listen to the tuning fork , throw caution to the wind , and take crazy risks I never thought were possible
TIN CUP: C'mon , Molly , when did you ever take a crazy risk ?
MOLLY: I fell for you

SAM: Did ya see 'Bonanza ' last night ? Can you tell me why Ben Cartwright had a colored guy stay over ?
GIL: Ben Cartwright had a colored guy stay overnight at the Ponderosa ?
MOUSE: Did he know this guy personally ?
SAM: No he was just passing through , asked if he could stay over , and Ben Cartwright said 'sure thing . ' It does n't make any sense he invites a strange colored guy in invited him in to stay . Is that crazy or what ? If a colored guy came to my door and said 'can I stay the night , ' I 'd tell him 'get the fuck out of here ' ! It 's nothing personal , mind you .
MOUSE: You 're not a bigot , is that what you 're telling us ?
SAM: Me ? No , I 'm not a bigot .
GIL: If you 're not , how come you 're making such a big thing out of it ?
SAM: It 's the fact the Ben Cartwright 's on the Ponderosa he 's in the middle of nowhere . It 's not like he 's living on Reisterstown Road with houses all around we 're talking about the West here . It 's the idea that a strange guy comes to the door in the middle of the West . It does n't make sense , that 's all I 'm saying .
MOUSE: Come on you 're a bigot , that 's what you are .
SAM: Listen , I 'll sell tin to anybody I do n't care who he is . A mark 's a mark , whether he 's Chinese , Indian or from Mars I 'm thoroughly integrated . Makes no difference to me I just would n't have one of those guys sleep in my house .
TILLEY: Florence , eggs and the toast , the way I like it .
FLORENCE: Not too gooey . Coffee right away .
SAM: I just do n't believe that 'Bonanza ' is an accurate description of the West . I say no more .
TILLEY: Come on , give me a couple of more inches .
SAM: You want me to take my plate I 'll eat in the parking lot .
TILLEY: Come on , Sam , I 'm having a terrible morning . You 're not going to elieve this , some guy just crashed into me right in the middle of the street then he attacks me . One of the loonies .
SAM: Did ya live ?
MOUSE: Did you get his name ?
TILLEY: Yeah , I got his name . The police came God , I ca n't believe it the guy 's an idiot . He pulls a piece of paper from his pocket .
GIL: I know the guy they call him
TILLEY: You know the son of a bitch ?
GIL: Yeah , he works with Bagel .
TILLEY: He sells aluminum siding ? I do n't believe it of all the people that could run into me , it has to be a fucking tin man . How come I do n't know him ?
GIL: You musta seen him . He hangs out with Carly Benelli , Cheese you know , that group .
TILLEY: I do n't know the guy .
GIL: Do n't you remember , he was up at the Corral one night when we were there he 's a good dancer . You must have seen him .
TILLEY: I do n't know the guy .
SAM: Gil , he does n't know the guy .
GIL: I thought he knew him , Sam I ca n't believe he does n't know him .
SAM: He seems to be indicating that he does n't know him .
TILLEY: I do n't know the guy !
GIL: He 's a good dancer .
TILLEY: What do you want me to do , date him ? What do I give a shit if he 's a good dancer ?
GIL: I thought you saw him . I was amazed , he does a Marengay I tell you if I was a girl I 'd be impressed .
SAM: You 're not a girl and you 're impressed !
TILLEY: Is it fresh ?
FLORENCE: Yes , it 's fresh !
TILLEY: Just asking , Florence .
FLORENCE: You 're always just asking . Gil still talking about BB .
GIL: I 'm telling you , you just ca n't elieve how well this guy does the Marengay .
MOUSE: I ca n't wait to see it .
TILLEY: I 'll tell you one thing , when I get a hold of this guy , I 'll eak both his legs and then he wo n't dance the Marengay too good .

LOONEY: So , what ya got ? Cheese throws his hand down .
CHEESE: Pair of sixes .
LOONEY: Jacks . Win .
CARLY: Shit ! Pair of sixes .
MOE: How much damage ?
BB: I bet it 's six hundred bucks .
LOONEY: Six hundred bucks ? I 'd get rid of the car . That much damage it wo n't be any good . You may have dented the frame .
BB: I did n't dent the frame .
LOONEY: When you hit the frame , the ca does n't ride right .
BB: He did n't hit the frame ! I 'll tell you this , I 'm gon na get the son of a bitch . If he would have apologized or something , ut this guy gets out , tries to push me around .
CHEESE: You 're kidding me ?
BB: Yeah the guy 's totally off the wall . He takes a sip of his coffee .
MOE: Now , let me see we got ta be at the Hickey house at four . It 's about three-twenty now we 've got some time on our hands . You want to get some coffee ?
BB: No , I 'm up to here with the coffee . He indicates his throat .
MOE: They got any good pool halls around here ?
BB: I do n't know . You know what would be fun to do.. ? Let 's try the Life Magazine outine .
MOE: Yeah .
BB: I think this is a better position the light is hitting it , which is accentuating the effect we 're going for . It 's very good very good .
MOE: This shows the flaws in the structure
BB: She 's at the window .
MOE: Yeah .
BB: This is going to be terrific in Life Magazine . Terrific in Life Magazine ! Come on outside , honey .
MOE: This should be our single biggest issue of Life Magazine .
BB: Bingo !
HOUSEWIFE: Excuse me . What are you doing ?
MOE: Oh , I hope we 're not disturbing you , ma'am . We 're with Life Magazine we 'll be out of here in just a minute .
BB: Move the tripod another foot another foot . Moe moves the tripod .
HOUSEWIFE: What do you mean , Life Magazine ?
BB: Two minutes , ma'am , and we 'll be out of here . We just need the picture for Life Magazine , and we 'll be out of here .
HOUSEWIFE: Life Magazine ? I do n't understand .
BB: It 's very simple . Ya know , we 're doing this layout about the enefits of aluminum siding a 'before ' and 'after ' kind of presentation .
HOUSEWIFE: A 'before ' picture ?
MOE: So they see your house , and anothe one done with aluminum siding the other house looking so much more beautiful .
HOUSEWIFE: In Life Magazine ?
MOE: It 's a special issue on home improvements and ways to beautify your home .
BB: A wonderful issue it 's one of the finest pictorial things we 've done here at Life the ways you can improve your house . We 're gon na be out of here in no time , ma'am .
MOE: It 's gon na look very good , BB .
HOUSEWIFE: My house is going to be the 'before ' ? Ca n't mine be like the 'after ' ?
BB: No , no we 've got a house that looked like yours and it 's been done in aluminum it 's very nice .
MOE: Yeah really shows the contrast of what a house can look like .
HOUSEWIFE: What does it cost ?
BB: What ? The aluminum siding ? Oh I do n't know the figures offhand . Do you have any idea , Moe ?
MOE: I think it 's fairly reasonable .
HOUSEWIFE: Could my house be the 'after ' in Life Magazine and you get anothe house for the 'before . '
BB: You mean have your house as the 'after ' and find another house that looks like your house fo the 'before ' ?
HOUSEWIFE: Is it possible ?
BB: What do ya think , Moe ? Would that be ethical ?
MOE: Well , we did n't sign any agreement with the 'after ' house . We 'd have to move very quickly , ma'am you know what I mean ?
BB: You 'd have to work out an arrangement with an aluminum siding company and they 'd have to do the job very quickly fo us to make our deadline we 've got a deadline , that 's the problem .
HOUSEWIFE: How quickly ?
MOE: BB , what do you think ? Can we slide the deadline , or what ? Six or seven days ?
BB: Pressing it . Do you think we could manage it , Moe ?
MOE: It 's pushing it , BB . What time would your husband be home , 'cos he 'd have to go ove the figures with the salesman that 's if there 's a salesman available this evening .
HOUSEWIFE: He 'll be home at seven .
BB: We might be able to work it .
HOUSEWIFE: That would be wonderful .
CARLY: Okay we 've got a total of thirty-seven hundred dollars .
HUSBAND: Thirty-seven hundred dollars ?
HOUSEWIFE: Honey , we 're gon na be in Life Magazine .
BB: Moe , did you call the office and make sure we can hold up the issue until this job is completed ? This house really could be a showcase .
HUSBAND: Thirty-seven hundred dollars !
CARLY: I tell you what I 've got an idea . Do you mind my guys working on a Saturday ? 'Cos if my crew can work on Saturday next , that 'll free my guys up on Monday . Yeah , that 'll really help me out on another job . Anyway , if we can do that , I think I 'll be able to knock off three hundred and fifty dollars from the job . You see , I 've got an overlapping situation on Monday I do n't want to go into it . What do ya think ? We got a deal ?
HUSBAND: Yep .
LOONEY: What are the benefits of aluminum siding ? One you never have to paint .
CHEESE: You have much greate insulation .
MOUSE: It cuts down on your heating ills
GIL: So what we 've got is efficiency and the beautification of you home .
HUSBAND #2: No , I 'm sorry , Mr. Tilley , I just ca n't afford it .
TILLEY: We have n't even got to discussing terms . There are so many friendly financial arrangements that would hardly be a bite into your weekly salary .
HUSBAND #2: No not this time .
TILLEY: Well , as I said , you can always each me you 've got my card , and when the time comes , let 's talk .
HUSBAND #2: Randy .
TILLEY: Randy , right . Well , good night .
SAM: The amount of time you spent there , I thought you were ready to send for me to close it up .
TILLEY: Damn ! I thought I had 'em . Tilley STARTS the CAR and pulls out .
PIANIST: 'Tall and tan and young and lovely , the girl from Ipanema goes walking , and when she passes each one she passes goes `` Ah ! '' '
WING: Forty-six hundred dollars . This looks like a sound deal . They own their own house we wo n't have any problem getting the financing for them . Real good , Mouse .
MOUSE: Thanks , boss . Pleasure doing usiness with ya .
WING: Now , what 's your guys ' story ?
TILLEY: Nothing again came up short . Let me get a little advance three hundred , just to carry me for a bit .
WING: Tilley , I 'm already carrying you for , what is it twenty-three hundred ? Something like that ?
TILLEY: No problem just in a little slump here .
WING: Do n't try to go walking on me .
TILLEY: What do you mean , walking ? You think I 'm gon na work somewhere else you 've been very good to me very honorable .
SAM: He 's always said that about you , Wing . Always said that about you he has .
WING: I 'll give you hundred and fifty .
TILLEY: Wing , I need a bit more than that I got expenses .
WING: What 's wrong with your wife ? She does n't work ?
TILLEY: Yeah , but how much is she gon na make working at the Social Security office ?
WING: All right , I 'll give you two hundred .
MOUSE: Honey , can you get me some Marlboros and a 7 and 7 ?
SAM: And some scotch , straight up . Tilley pockets the check .
WING: Now listen , guys , we got a problem here .
SAM: Did she hear me say scotch straight up ?
WING: My sources tell me this Home Improvement Commission is for real it 's no jackpot . These guys are going to be a real pain in the ass , so any of the scams that you guys are pulling , they get wind of it , they take your license and it 's goodbye to this business .
MOUSE: They take away your license ? They take away your livelihood ? What kind of people are these ?
SAM: They have no respect for the working man .
TILLEY: Which scams are they talking about ? They got a list ?
WING: Any irregularities , you know , selling a house on the pretense that it 's a model house and every job sold in the area they get a kickback the Life Magazine hustle you guys know all the bullshit numbers we can un .
SAM: Jesus ! What a pain in the ass . Do you think this commission 's gon na stick around or is it gone with the wind ?
TILLEY: They take your license ?
MOE: I would n't mind seeing Africa some time .
BB: Not me . I do n't want to go where they 've got snakes .
MOE: They 've got snakes ?
BB: I 've heard they 've got snakes that 'll outrun a horse through the grass . They got a snake that bites you you got eleven seconds to live . No thank you . I do n't want to spend my good money to visit with that kind of jeopardy . I 'd like to go to a place where hold it ! He hits the brakes suddenly .
MOE: What 's wrong ?
BB: The guy who ran into me that 's his car .
BB: I 'll be back , Moe . I 'm gon na even the score .
TILLEY: Give me eight points I take the Knicks over the Lakers for 20 .
MOUSE: It 's too big a spread .
TILLEY: It 's that fucking lunatic again .
MOUSE: Is n't that something ?
SAM: What 's he got , a gnat up his ass ? What the hell 's wrong with the guy ?
GIL: Do n't you recognize him from the Corral ?
TILLEY: I do n't know the guy !
GIL: I 'll never forget his Marengay .
TILLEY: I 'll tell you something , if Mr. Marengay wants to play we 'll play .
NORA: Look at you , quarter to three and home already . What happened ? You and the fellas run out of things to talk about ?
TILLEY: Please ! I 'm out there working myself to the bone , trying to make a living .
NORA: What 's a five letter word for a Portuguese overseas province ?
TILLEY: Try Macao .
NORA: M-A-C-A-O that fits .
TILLEY: What 're you doing up so late ?
NORA: We 're off tomorrow . Beat .
TILLEY: I think this place may be a little too large for us .
NORA: What are you talking about this match box ?
TILLEY: It 's got a lot of overhead to it . What do you do spend your time in the bedroom and the kitchen , that 's all . So why do you need a living room and a dining room . He walks over to the back door and looks out .
NORA: You 're not selling anything ?
TILLEY: I 'm in a slump .
NORA: It happens .
TILLEY: Last year I 'm number three top seller year before , right up there . I ca n't get my momentum going this year .
NORA: Well , you will . You always do .
TILLEY: I 'm not sure I like the idea of all this overhead breathing down my neck . When you have a place like this , that 's a lot of overhead .
NORA: What are you talking about ? The monthly payments on your Cadillac are more than this whole house . Why do n't you get yourself something cheaper , like a Chevy ?
TILLEY: It does n't instill confidence in my clients . Cadillac means that you 're dealing with someone of importance . I thought I had a couple tonight they just slipped away slipped away . I 'm gon na take a bath my neck 's een tight since this morning .
NORA: I 'll turn out the lights .
TILLEY: Like what ?
NORA: Do things together that are enjoyable .
TILLEY: What would we do together fo it to be enjoyable ?
NORA: If we went on a picnic it would be fun .
TILLEY: I do n't understand a picnic we just go some place we put a thing on the ground , and we eat .
NORA: Yes it 's nice to do that .
TILLEY: Why ? I do n't get it . It 's bette sitting at home and watching TV .
NORA: I think there 's something nice about a picnic it 's fun .
TILLEY: What 's fun about it ? Ants get into the food there 's bees . I do n't get it . We have to drive , it takes maybe an hour to get there , then you sit in grass and eat . Why is that fun ?
NORA: I just thought it might be nice to do something together , that 's all thought it might be fun .
TILLEY: It does n't sound like fun to me you take the stuff you 've got here in the house , you take it someplace to eat it . It 's just as much fun eating in front of the TV , and we do that together , do n't we ? No ants and no bees much more comfortable .
NORA: It 's not the same thing .
TILLEY: Scrub my back , will ya , Nora .
TILLEY: Not too hard ! Do n't get me wrong , I 'm willing to do anything with you . I 'm just a little stymied by a picnic . If you want to go , send me a postcard .
GIL: I think you make a left here . Tilley turns the car .
TILLEY: Okay , Mr. Marengay here I come .
GIL: Hey , Tilley , do n't go too wild
TILLEY: I 'll show the son of a bitch .
GIL: Quick , Tilley let 's get out of here . Tilley runs back to his car and drives away .
BAGEL: This whole section has been very fertile for us .
MOE: Sure you wan na get into the tin game ?
STANLEY: Money 's good , I understand .
LOONEY: Lot of crazy people you 're gon na un into when you 're knocking on those doors . Hermits that do n't see the outside world , Jehovah 's Witnesses that try and sell you the Bible at the same time you 're trying to sell them tin . People that are just lonely and want to have conversations .
CARLY: Every time you step in that door , you 've got to be fast on your feet .
STANLEY: Interesting .
MOE: What 's the best way to qualify a mark ?
STANLEY: What ?
MOE: How do you know if you can get the upper hand ? How do you know if you 're dealing with a guy who 's in an inferior position to you , o superior position ? How do you know ? Moe puts Stanley on the defensive .
STANLEY: You just have to talk and feel your way .
MOE: Quick way get a book of matches out of your pocket to light your cigarette you drop the matches on the floor .
STANLEY: Yeah .
MOE: Guy bends down to pick up the matches for you , you got a mark you got this guy in your pocket . If he looks to you to pick it up , you 've got a long , hard , tough sell on your hands .
BB: You want to get in good with these people you want to win thei confidence ? Good thing to try get a five dollar bill , take it out when the guy 's not looking , drop it on the ground . Guy looks ack , pick it up , hand it to him and say , 'Mr . Blah blah , you musta dropped this five dolla ill on the ground . ' Two things happen he says , 'It 's not mine , ' you say , 'Musta been , 'cos it 's certainly not mine , ' or the guy takes it . Right away this guy is thinking you must be one hell of a nice guy you 're in . You start chipping away you start getting inside those people .
LOONEY: Yeah , we 'd better go , too . Come on , Stanley . Me and Stanley . It 's like a first date .
BB: This guy 's looking to play tit for tat . That 's not my game . I 'm gon na play hardball . BB throws the glass down on the ground .
STANLEY: What 's going on ?
BB: I 'm gon na find out everything about this son of a bitch , and then I 'm gon na find the one thing that cuts him to the quick .
MOE: Let 's go inside make some calls . BB nods and they start back inside .
TILLEY: Damn it ! Damn it ! I ca n't believe it I ca n't believe I did that .
MOUSE: Well , then , believe it . There 's no sense not to believe it , ecause you did it so believe it . That 's twenty more you owe me sixty .
TILLEY: You think I ca n't add ?
MOUSE: 'Dayo ! da , da , da , da , day . Daylight come and he wan na go home '
GIL: Oh , this is going to be good .
MOUSE: 'Dayo ! da , da , da , da , da , da , da . ' 'Daylight come and he wan na go home '
SAM: Jesus Christ !
TILLEY: From the IRS . I never even emember seeing it . I must have left it with my other bills . I wonder what it is ?
SAM: Maybe it 's a refund check .
TILLEY: Hum says here that they have n't eceived my 1962 taxes . They seem to be saying that they did n't get my check for four thousand dollars .
SAM: What ? It must be a clerical error .
TILLEY: I ca n't believe they spend all that time and energy to write to me to single me out .
SAM: What are you talking about ? You did n't pay your taxes ?
TILLEY: I probably forgot people forget their taxes all the time just slipped my mind I got so many things on my mind .
SAM: You ca n't mess around with the government . Why do n't you go to H & R Block , they 'll take care of your taxes for you .
TILLEY: You think I 'm gon na let some schmuck know all my business have some guy pull me over the coals for spending on this and that . I need some privacy .
SAM: Taxes is serious stuff , Tilley .
TILLEY: I can just see that schmuck in that little tax shop telling people my business how much I make how much I spend no way !
SAM: All I can say , is you better get a lawyer or somebody to look into this , 'cos the IRS , they do n't fuck around .
TILLEY: Just what I need in my life right now I 'm in a slump and I 've got the IRS on me . Like when something goes wrong , it 's like
BB: Are these any good do ya know ? These TV dinners ?
NORA: I do n't think they 're too good for you , not a lot of 'em anyway .
BB: My wife died .
NORA: Oh , I 'm sorry to hear that .
BB: I 'm over it now , but it was a very trying time very trying I 've only just started eating again .
NORA: You know what would be a lot more healthy and satisfying is to get yourself a chicken just pop it in the oven for a couple of hours with a little bit of seasoning on it . Makes a good meal , and you can make sandwiches with the leftovers .
BB: But then you have to sit and watch it cook . Something seems sad about a man sitting alone in a house and watching a chicken cook .
MOE: He 's an amazing sort he 's got the gift .
MAN: Thank you , Mr. Tilley . I ca n't elieve it this is the most generous thing anyone 's ever done Swell ! Like a gift from heaven .
WIFE: The Lord has certainly blessed us this evening .
TILLEY: Well , what can I say I 'm a modest person I just do what I can to help .
MAN: Thanks again .
SAM: So , what 's the scoop ?
TILLEY: We got 'em ! He 's very excited .
SAM: You 're kidding ?
TILLEY: Take a look at this , Sam .
SAM: Are you fucking crazy ? You just gave them forty-two hundred dollars in aluminum siding free ? !
TILLEY: This is the best scam I 've eve thought of in my whole life .
SAM: What are you talking about ?
TILLEY: Here it is you go back in the house and this is what you say
SAM: Mr. Tilley is crazy he had a nervous breakdown . WIDEN to include Man and Wife from before .
MAN: What 's that ?
SAM: He 's been under a lot of pressure ecently he snapped he had a nervous breakdown it 's the saddest thing I 've ever seen . Let 's be honest about it , nobody gives away forty-two hundred dollars ' worth of aluminum siding free .
MAN: I thought it was very generous , ut sometimes the Lord moves in mysterious ways .
SAM: Let me tell you something , when I go and see his boss and show him this contract , he 's out of this usiness he 'll lose his home his wife and kids will be thrown out onto the street . He 'll probably spend some time in an institution , so God knows what will happen to his wife and kids . Anyway , it 's not your problem .
MAN: Why do they have to be thrown out onto the street ?
SAM: You do n't expect his boss to pick up the forty-two hundred job , do ya ?
MAN: Hmm .
SAM: Yeah , it 's a bad state of affairs . Let me ask you something , sir .
MAN: Yes ?
SAM: You do n't think there 's some way you could work with me to try and resolve this , do you ?
MAN: How so ?
SAM: Let 's look at it this way , what if I can sell you this job at a wholesale price kind of lessens the burden . The big boss wo n't get so angry , and maybe wo n't throw the guy 's wife and kids out at least they 'll have a roof over thei heads .
MAN: What kind of wholesale price are we talking about ?
SAM: You got a cup of coffee ?
WIFE: I 'll get you a coffee wo n't be a minute .
SAM: Let 's just sit down and kick this around . The Wife goes into the kitchen .
MAN: What 's that ?
SAM: I found a five-dollar bill , here y the side of the chair .
CARLY: The buzzard had a great gimmick . You know , when it came time to measure a job , he 'd cut the yardstick and reglue it togethe he took out seven inches so his square footage would always e higher . That way he 'd always make a few extra bucks on the job .
STANLEY: You 're kidding ?
CARLY: Yeah he 'd always put his hand over the break when he was measuring . Nobody looks at a yardstick to see how long it is .
LOONEY: I never did that I never did that I was never very good in arts and crafts . I could neve make the ruler come out right . The song ends .
BB: Here 's to Nora .
STANLEY: What else ? Give me another story these stories are great !
LOONEY: Just a minute I 've got one . You know it 's like the faster you can start spiking a job , the guy ca n't back out of the deal .
TILLEY: Fantastic , Sam ! A twenty-seven hundred sale ! 'This job is free ' ! What a beaut ! I 'm out of the slump ! Tilley 's riding high again Tilley 's back ! We ought to go and celebrate . Let 's go to the Corral and have a drink we can turn the paperwork in a little later .
SAM: Gil says that 's where 'Marengay ' hangs out .
TILLEY: Gil keeps saying it I 've neve seen him . I 'm riding high twenty-seven hundred dollars 'this job is free ' the man went insane lost control of himself his wife and children are out on the street ! Sometimes I 'm brilliant I 'm fucking brilliant I ca n't elieve it .
BB: See that one , if you were married to that one two weeks you 'd have to put your head out of the window for air this one smothers . That one is the kind that ca n't live without you 'Where were you ? When will you be home ? '
MOE: I should get out of here . I told my wife I 'd be home early tonight .
BB: Christ ! It 's not even one o'clock yet . How long you been married now ? What is it ? Twelve twelve years ?
MOE: Sixteen .
BB: Holy God ! Sixteen years ? What do you think ? Is it worth it ?
MOE: Yeah .
BB: Why do you think ?
MOE: It 's hard to answer . Seems better than if she was n't there .
BB: Quite a recommendation ca n't wait to do it . He laughs .
TILLEY: Scotch straight up ?
SAM: Yeah .
TILLEY: Scotch straight up and a rum and Coke for me . He looks around the room at the women .
SAM: What do you expect , it 's half price night for divorced women . The place is hopping .
BB: Look how much more complicated things are now . There used to e a time you met a girl , you courted and then you got married and lived happily ever after . Now , see that one over there that 's Helen Armstrong maiden name used to be Tudor . Get this , she dated Charlie Rider when I was in high school , seemed like they were togethe forever . They broke up , she started to go with Lenny Mardigian , they got married , she 's Helen Mardigian . That goes on two years three years , something like that .
SAM: I 'm beginning to believe in God .
TILLEY: You were never one of those atheists , were you ?
SAM: No , I 'm not saying that , but I 'm eginning to give God more thought .
TILLEY: So , what did you do ? Have some kind of religious experience ?
SAM: I tell ya I took my wife fo lunch yesterday we went and had some smorgasbord , and it kind of happened .
TILLEY: You found God at the smorgasbord ?
SAM: Yeah .
TILLEY: Sam , people have religious experiences like on a lake o when they go up into the mountains , that kind of thing .
SAM: Maybe but I had mine in a smorgasbord .
TILLEY: Sam , you 're too much .
SAM: I went to get myself a salad and I started to see all these vegetables , you know how they have all those salads laid out so that when it 's time to get to the main course you wo n't eat too much that scam to get you filled up so you do n't eat too much chicken and beef and all that other stuff .
TILLEY: Yeah , yeah I get the point . So ?
SAM: So I see celery , I see the lettuce , tomatoes , cauliflower and I think , all these things come out of the ground they just grow out of the ground . They had corn out of the ground radish out of the ground . You say to yourself , how can all these things come out of the ground ? You know what I 'm talking about ? All these things are out of the ground .
TILLEY: Yeah .
SAM: I mean , how can that be ? It just happened that way ? And I 'm not even getting into the fruits I 'm just dealing with vegetables ight now . With all those things coming out of the earth , there must be a God .
TILLEY: I 'm not getting the same religious effect that came over you . I do n't know why , but I do n't feel like running to a church to pray ight this second .
SAM: You got ta admit , it 's amazing .
TILLEY: Yeah , yeah I do n't believe it . See the guy over there ? He looks in the direction of BB .
BB: I do n't believe it ! Mr. Banana Head is here .
MOE: What ?
BB: That crazy guy that banged into my car and smashed my windows in . I do n't fucking believe it ! I 'm gon na get him .
TILLEY: I 'm gon na get him !
BB: You got a lot of nerve banging into my car , and you 've got a lot of fucking nerve smashing my windows in .
TILLEY: What 're you talking about ? Why would I want to break you windows ?
BB: You did n't smash my windows in ?
TILLEY: I 'm a hard-working guy I do n't go around breaking windows . I 've got better things to do .
BB: You did n't break my windows ? ! You did n't break my windows ? ! He pushes Tilley .
TILLEY: Push me one more time and I 'm gon na have to redefine your face .
BB: Come on , let 's go outside let 's settle this in the parking lot .
TILLEY: Oh , no ! You 're not gon na get near my car you 're not gon na kick in my headlights again What am I talking about ? I did n't even drive tonight . You wan na duke it ? Let 's go .
BB: What is this ? What is this crowd here ? We 're charging admission ?
TILLEY: Back away give me some elbow oom .
MOE: Police !
TILLEY: You 're a lucky man the police showed .
BB: We 'll see who 's the lucky one . He picks up his coat and leaves with Moe .
ADA: I never expected this . What a lovely cake .
GIRL #1: Blow out the candles then .
GIRL #2: Nine candles for nine months ! Everyone laughs .
GIRL #3: We 'll miss you , Ada you 'd etter bring that baby in to visit us .
GIRL #1: Register him for his social security number .
NORA: I love ya , Ada , and if you 're smart you wo n't come back .
NELLIE: You 're kidding ?
NORA: I have to . I just want to know what it 's like to be with someone else . She sips her Coke .
NELLIE: Well , how are you going to manage it ?
NORA: Tilley does n't get home until at least two in the morning .
NELLIE: I hope you know what you 're doing you speak to some guy at the frozen food section for five minutes , you could jeopardize your whole marriage .
NORA: Everything I 've done in my life has been safe and practical , and where 's that gotten me ? Well , here 's to who knows what . They touch their cups .
NORA: I 'm still nervous .
BB: Well , I guess that 's to be expected . You want me to take you home ?
NORA: No , not right now . They dance quietly for a moment .
BB: Every time I listen to Sinatra , I always remember when I used to work in Atlantic City back in the late 40 's you know , a busboy job Sinatra used to play at the 500 Club , and we used to take ou dates and say , 'Hey , you wan na go and hear Sinatra ? ' Then we 'd just lean on the door of the clu in the alley and listen to the music . I think the girls were looking for something a bit more uptown . Nora laughs .
NORA: I 'd go with you and lean against the door .
BB: I sure do .
BARMAN: Yeah , he 's here just a minute .
TILLEY: Yeah , this is Tilley
BB: Hey , asshole here 's the ultimate 'fuck you ' I just poked your wife !
TILLEY: What are you talking about ?
BB: She 's in my bed right now with a ig smile on her face .
TILLEY: Well , that 's just fine by me she 's a pain in the ass an albatross around my neck . You 're welcome to her keep her and may you both rot in hell ! Tilley slams the phone down .
BB: Is this a setup ? That son of a itch I bet he set me up I thought I got him , and he got me . That son of a bitch !
TILLEY: I 'm a free man ! I 'm a free man !
NORA: Oh , my God !
BB: Sure .
GIRL #1: Hello , this is Gibraltar Aluminum Siding Company , we 're taking a survey
GIRL #2: Would you be interested in our field representative giving you a home demonstration ?
GIRL #3: Home demonstration . We will have some factory representatives in your area today as it happens . A voice calls out .
TILLEY: Wing , give me a minute to get a cup of coffee here .
SAM: What about 'Super Highway ' in the seventh it 's paying 7 to 1 . Ran well in its last race . Gil looking at the newspaper .
GIL: 'Super Highway '
TILLEY: Four in the fourth twenty bucks .
SAM: Who 's that ?
TILLEY: I do n't know it just came to me number four in the fourth .
SAM: Number four in the fourth 'Rider 's Revenge ' 60 to 1 , never been in the money . Nice pick , Tilley . Why do n't you just throw the twenty dollars in the trash can ight now .
TILLEY: 'Rider 's Revenge ' I like that name . I 've got ta go and see Wing . Look , we can be scientific from now to doomsday , but we got ta be gutsy and go for the big one .
WING: You lost a sale , Tilley . The Hudsons ' loan did n't go through .
TILLEY: What do ya mean ? They would n't clear the loan ?
WING: This Mr. Hudson 's some guy . He 's got three outstanding shoplifting charges , failure to pay child support from a previous marriage guy 's overdue on his mortgage , overdue on his car loan , and he was fired from his last job fo misappropriation of funds .
TILLEY: What 's wrong with this world ? There are sick people out there ! Thievin ' son of a bitch like that takes up my time cuts into the amount of hours I have available to deal with othe people interested in my wares ! There 's no fucking sympathy fo the working man in this country .
WING: They do n't make our job easy , Tilley .
TILLEY: Wing , it was such a beautiful thing you shoulda seen how I worked . Like a magician 'this job is free ' ! It was my best my best ! There 's no fucking justice in this world there ai n't no justice .
WING: Did you see the paper ?
TILLEY: What section ?
WING: Take a look at this . He hands the newspaper to Tilley .
TILLEY: 'Home Improvement Commission Hearings begin today '' Is this McCarthyism ? What are they gon na see ? If there are any communists ?
WING: Just cool down the scams , okay , Tilley ? Tilley shrugs his shoulders .
MASTERS: Now , when you made your initial sales pitch , did you indicate that you would be giving free storm windows with the job ?
MURRAY: Free storm windows ?
MASTERS: Yes . That you would provide a free set of storm windows with the sale of aluminum siding .
MURRAY: No , sir . I would n't be able to make any money if I was giving away storm windows . My cost of a storm window is somewhere like
MASTERS: The point being that you had no intention of giving away the storm windows .
MOE: What do ya make of all this ?
BB: It 's the future , Moe it 's the future .
MOE: Where do you think they 're getting this information from ?
BB: I dunno looks like any tin man gets in that hot seat , then he 's had it .
MOE: Then they can take your license forever it do n't seem fair .
BB: Boy , I tell ya , I bet you could sell a ton of these things .
MOE: That ? Too silly-looking .
BB: Ever see a dealership ?
MOE: No .
BB: Interesting . They get in the car and drive off .
TILLEY: I keep racking my brain . I got ta find a way to really get even with this guy . It is n't enough to wreck his car even breaking into his house and messing it up or something , that do n't have enough impact . I mean , the man poked my wife ! I got ta come up with something ingenious something ingenious .
SAM: So , what do ya think ?
TILLEY: I think I 'll take some meatloaf .
WAITER: Meatloaf .

TILLEY: Six six six six . I 'm thinking one . Whose one ?
SAM: Mr. Motor .
TILLEY: Then that 's it , I 'm going with one .
SAM: Tilley , this is insane . You 're picking horses because you think you 're clairvoyant or something .
TILLEY: Sam , I 'm not doing too well by checking the stats , so why not . I put my hand to my forehead , I see a one Mr. Motor in the second twenty bucks .
SAM: Hallihan 's Daughter .
TILLEY: I got it I got it He picks up the racing form .
SAM: You 're not exactly talking about a long shot . Mr. Motor , fo instance , is coming off at 50 to 1 .
TILLEY: Third race , I see a six I see a three . I do n't think the verdict 's in on that one yet .
SAM: Thrifty 's Delight number four 20 bucks .
TILLEY: You take Thrifty 's Delight 20 ucks , I got 20 on Mr. Motor , Wing 's got a hundred on Night Fire . What 's the odds on Night Fire ?

TILLEY: I do n't see Night Fire winning . Fuck it , I 'm not gon na even place the bet I just made a hundred bucks .
SAM: What are you , crazy ? What happens if he wins ?

TILLEY: Hey , Wing , we 're sitting just off the left of the entrance . I 'm gon na lay down your bet right now . See you in a minute . You lost the first race , in case you do n't know .
BB: I tell you something , she 's getting on my nerves .
MOE: Who , Nora ?
BB: Yeah , yeah who else is it gon na be 'who , Nora '' ! who else is there ? The whole idea of being with a girl on consecutive nights is new to me . It 's one thing when they 're with you for a night , ut when they live with ya , it 's stretching the point . They got a lot of things they bring with them you go to the bathroom you see 'things ' you never saw efore .
MOE: So , what 's the todo ?
BB: Well , they move your stuff around and it 's not where it used to e I 'm not used to that .
MOE: You mean all this time you 've never lived with a girl ?
BB: What ? ! Did we just meet ? How long we been partners ? No , I 've never lived with a girl !
MOE: Boy , oh boy ! Did you wake up on the wrong side of the bed today ?
BB: Yes , I did . I came in last night , she was sleeping on my side of the bed . In my life I never got out of bed on the left side in my life , never from the left . I got close once up in the Catskills . I met this girl , Dorian . For a week we were together , but it was n't the same because she always went to her room to change and do all that stuff . She did n't have things in my room . BB gives a big sigh .
NELLIE: Is that him ?

BB: You know , like things that come up stuff like you know , annoyances .
NORA: Annoyances ?
BB: Hard to explain very hard .
NORA: Well , try .
BB: As an example I came home last night , I get undressed , and I realize you 're sleeping on my side of the bed . I 've always slept on that side it 's something I 've always done .
NORA: Then why did n't you just nudge me a bit and tell me to go and sleep on the other side ?
BB: I did n't want to wake you up I thought you might think it was kind of stupid or something .
NORA: Well , that 's easily changed .
BB: But there are other things igger things . But I realize just talking about it , they all sound petty and silly .
NORA: Listen , if you think all of this is going too fast , maybe I should move out . Is that what you want , Bill ?
BB: I do n't think we 've got to take drastic action . Nora smiles .
NORA: I ca n't get away from work .

TILLEY: It happens I do n't know how I do n't know how to explain . It 's too crazy , I swear to God , Wing .
WING: Wait a minute you 're telling me that I did n't win the last race ?
TILLEY: You won , Wing you won , it 's just that you 're not getting any money it was a fluke . I swear , I do n't know how it could have happened . A ten-year-old could n't have made the mistake I made I do n't know , I swear .

TILLEY: No . I 'd split fifty-fifty with you , that 's how badly I feel under the circumstances .
WING: You get this straight , you son of a bitch , you owe me sixteen plus I want sixteen plus .
TILLEY: Am I trying to shirk my esponsibility ? That 's not the way I see it it was a fluke , a crazy thing that happened , but I stand behind my honor on this put it on my tab .
WING: What the hell is wrong with him ? What the hell is wrong with him ? He 's stealing money from me what the hell is wrong with him ? Can you tell me ?
SAM: I do n't know the whole story .
WING: You work with him , Sam fo Christ sake Wing is totally frustrated .
TILLEY: What do you mean , wrong ? It was a fluke it was an accident . I do n't know what the hell went wrong . It was a one-in-a-million thing that happened to me when I went to place that bet . I 'm trying to do what I can .
WING: Tilley , what the hell happened to you ?
SAM: Why did n't you at least give him the six hundred that you pocketed from the six races he lost ?
TILLEY: Fuck him ! It 's on my tab . At least I 've got six hundred in my pocket right now . It 's like another loan . Sam , you got to think about today . Today , I got six hundred bucks in my pocket . You know what I 'm saying ?
SAM: Yeah .
TILLEY: It 's like some guy trying to sell me life insurance . You think I 'm gon na take some money out of my pocket to give to some jerk so that somebody can take it when I 'm dead ? No , Sam , you got ta live for today . I 'm gon na live as good as I can every day . You know what I 'm saying ?
BB: Did you bother to bet , or did you just hand your money to the tellers ?
TILLEY: The sarcasm 's killing me . I thought you were looking to get even .
BB: Who 's your accountant , mister , 'cos I think you 're down in the debit side .
TILLEY: Who 's stuck with my wife . You o me ? He laughs .
BB: You want me to believe that you were setting me up with you wife as some kind of decoy ?
TILLEY: Decoy is the word !
BB: Okay then , you win . BB gets into his car .
TILLEY: I win ? That guy would never let me win . He must be setting me up . The son of a bitch is setting me up , Sam .
SAM: For crying out loud , why do n't you just leave it at that you win .
TILLEY: I could n't have won . I smell a rat .
MOE: BB , I think you 're getting a little humility in your blood .
BB: If getting Nora is part of losing , Thank God I did n't win .
MASTERS: This is good , Stan nice work . Stanley nods .
STANLEY: There 's a lot more where this came from .
MASTERS: You know what I think you should do now . Why do n't you pull some files some files that were completed , others that went unsold , and I 'll have somebody un it down , talk to the customers and get some statements .
STANLEY: Pulling files is another thing . That might not be easy .
MASTERS: To sneak a few here and there when you can .
STANLEY: I 'll see .
MASTERS: I think that might be good .
MOE: You know what I do , Alan ? I pick certain houses that are strategically located , we put up the aluminum siding , and fo every referral , for every person who sees this quality job that we do sees how beautiful it is I give you two hundred dollars .
SHUBNER: Two hundred dollars ?
MOE: That 's right . God knows how many homes we could sell by people passing this house . It 's perfectly placed for that . Alan , this is how confident I feel that this house will drum up business for me .
MOE: Four hundred dollars I 'm giving you commission on two house eferrals before I put a panel on the side of your house that 's how confident I feel .
SHUBNER: You think that many people are going to
MOE: I 'm certain of it . I 'm not giving away four hundred dollars for my health I 'm a businessman , and I 'm a good businessman . This is good business for me . I 'm giving it away 'cos I believe in this house , believe that it will refe me to other jobs which means money in my pocket , which means money in your pocket .
SHUBNER: You got a deal , Mr. Gable . BB smiles . Suddenly Moe winces in pain .
BB: I finally got hold of May she was over your sister 's .
MOE: Oh , I forgot .
BB: She 'll be down here shortly .
MOE: BB , I do n't have any insurance . If I die , May 's got nothing nothing nothing for Leonard . The only money I 've got is in my pocket . That 's all I got .
BB: Just take it easy , Moe rest .
MOE: Did they sign ? Did they sign ?
BB: Do n't worry about it now .
MOE: Goddamn it , BB ! Did you sign them ?
BB: Do n't worry do n't worry . I 'll take care of it tomorrow .
MOE: Goddamn , my chest hurts . I always taught you , BB , neve walk out of a place without a signed contract . Somebody 's word ai n't spit .
BB: They 'll sign , Moe . Do n't worry , they 'll sign . They round the bend of the corridor .
BB: I dunno I thought I 'd bette call , that 's all .
SAM: Let me see what the damage is . Babum babum babum babum He hands the bill to Mouse .
GIL: Why do n't we just split it five ways ?
TILLEY: No way ! I did n't eat anything , so why should I pay for Mouse he eats like an animal .
SAM: Well , sometimes you 'll eat more than he does , and it 'll even out .
TILLEY: No way ! He 's a pig ! He always eats more than anyone else . Why should I pay for his food ?
MOUSE: What 're you talking about ? Today I happened to have eggs and flapjacks , some cantalope , some juice and then another juice .
TILLEY: Like an animal ! Like an animal !
MOUSE: But yesterday , what did I have ?
TILLEY: What did he have ? Sam , what did he have ?
SAM: Let me get out my notebook . How the fuck do I know what he had ?
TILLEY: Well I do n't remember what he had . Gil , what did he have ?
GIL: Pancakes ?
MOUSE: No .
TILLEY: Then what did you have ?
MOUSE: Guess .
TILLEY: What is this , a quiz show ? We do n't know what you had . What did you have ?
MOUSE: I had very little .
TILLEY: Very little ! ! You eat like an animal ! It could n't have been very little .
MOUSE: I did n't have that much does n't anybody remember ?
SAM: We do n't remember , I do n't know why .
GLI: I could have sworn he had pancakes .
TILLEY: He said he did n't have pancakes .
MOUSE: I 'll give you a clue maple syrup was used .
TILLEY: I do n't give a shit .
SAM: French toast . There 's a KNOCK at the window of the diner .

TILLEY: I do n't give a damn it 's split five ways .
GIL: Your wife 's knocking on the window here .

TILLEY: I know . I was just trying to e congenial you know , start a conversation off , on a nice kind of light level , you know . So , what 's the scoop , Nora ?
NORA: Well you know , I think we really should get divorced .
TILLEY: Makes sense . You want some more coffee ?
NORA: Yeah , I 'll have some .
TILLEY: Florence , some coffee here . It 's for the best . You know , we were kind of fooling ourselves , were n't we ?
NORA: Yes , it went wrong somewhere along the line I do n't know where though .
TILLEY: Yes , something went wrong I do n't know .
NORA: Yeah , I like him .
TILLEY: All in all I guess it 'll all work out for the best .
NORA: I 'm glad you feel that way .
TILLEY: Yeah , can you figure it out ? A guy bangs into my car , thinks I did him in , tries to get even with me by stealing my wife , you two people fall in love can you figure that out ?
NORA: What ?
TILLEY: You telling me you did n't know this was the guy ?
NORA: This was that guy ?
TILLEY: Yeah , I told you I ran into another tin man .
NORA: He did n't tell me he was a tin man he told me he sold baby pictures .
TILLEY: It 's your life . All I know is this guy has a bent weather vane .
NORA: Oh , God ! Not another tin man .

LOONEY: No . He do n't talk much ; he 's a good listener , so he ca n't really get on your nerves . He 's a lousy pool player and he ca n't play cards for shit , but
BB: So what good is he ?
LOONEY: Studious type takes a lot of notes .

There 's illions of dollars out there ut they 've got to come and get Tilley 's four thousand dollars ! Turn off the fucking Belafonte song now , or I 'm gon na break the goddamn machine ! !
RUTHIE: Come on , Beeb , let 's dance .
BB: Not tonight , Ruthie , my dancing shoes are on holiday .
RUTHIE: You sure ?
BB: I 'm more than sure .
STANLEY: Who was the best you ever saw ?
BB: Best I ever saw ? Best tin man I ever saw ?
STANLEY: What 's some of the hustles he used to pull ? BB downs another shot glass of whisky .
BB: God damn Nora God damn Nora ! I 'm trying to adjust I 'm putting up with things I neve put up with in my life . I mean , give me a break give me a eak , woman .
STANLEY: So , what are a couple of things you and Moe have done ?
BB: It was getting to be real pleasant figure that . More than pleasant . To hell with her !
STANLEY: How come Moe 's so good ? Why do you think , huh ?
BB: Great man , Moe . Great man .
TILLEY: They got no right . You know what I 'm saying , Sam ? They 've got no ight .
SAM: They 've got nothing concrete against us , because if it 's just hearsay stuff , it 's neither here nor there .
TILLEY: Where 's my car ? What happened to my car ?
SAM: It 's better I drop you off .
TILLEY: Yeah , it 's better .
BB: He ai n't here .
TILLEY: I knew I could smell a rat ! The son of a bitch is coming for me the son of a bitch never wants to leave me alone !
BB: Hel
TILLEY: You 're a sick man ! You smash my car , you steal my wife , and now you come to rob me ! You 're one demented human being . BB tries to focus on Tilley .
BB: What 're you doing ?
TILLEY: What do ya want to break into my house for ? This ai n't the fucking Rockefeller mansion ! There ai n't thirty-eight television sets here .
BB: You 're the craziest human being on the face of this earth ! Tilley , getting ready with another egg .
TILLEY: What else do you want from me ? Huh ? What else ? ! I 've got enough problems with the I.R.S . busting my balls and the Home Improvement Commission bullshit to contend with . I do n't need aggravation from you .
BB: Nobody does this to me and lives ! Nobody !
TILLEY: How do ya like your eggs ? Ove easy ? Side of tomatoes ? He throws a tomato .
BB: You 're going to rue the day you an into my car . This ai n't the end this is just the beginning . Tilley throws another egg .
TILLEY: A guy breaks into my house and I 'm eing charged with assault ? It makes no sense
POLICE OFFICER: Let 's get it down right . The guy oke into your house , you hit him in the head with a gun , went to the refrigerator , took out eggs and tomatoes and threw them at him .
TILLEY: I was defending myself he was stealing from me .
POLICE OFFICER: It does n't sound like defense to me .
TILLEY: I wanted to humiliate the guy . Here I am , out busting my ass all day making a decent living , I come home , and some schmuck is trying to steal from me .
POLICE OFFICER: So you hit him with a gun , and pelted him with eggs and tomatoes ?
TILLEY: If I had some soup I would have thrown soup at him is there any law you ca n't throw eggs ?
POLICE OFFICER: Mr. Babowski claims he did n't eak into your house .
TILLEY: What did I do ? Invite him in so that I could throw eggs at him ?
POLICE OFFICER: Maybe Mr. Babowski intended to eak into your house , but these circumstances of the guy being pelted with eggs and tomatoes is something we need to look into . Tilley shrugs his shoulders .
TILLEY: He 's lucky that he did n't rob me last week , 'cos then my wife was living at home and we had all kinds of things in the fridge I could have thrown barley soup , pumpkin pie , candied yams yeah , he got off light .
BB: I ca n't believe it , the man throws eggs at me and now I 'm gon na have eakfast with him .
BAGEL: His partner says maybe the two of you can sit down and come to some kind of settlement .
TILLEY: What am I supposed to say to him ? The man has been a pain in the ass since the day he rammed into my car .
SAM: Just air your differences and we 'll put an end to this .
TWO CADILLACS: as they start to pull out of the parking lot .
BB: I tell you what I 'll drop the charges against you , and we can wipe the slate clean .
TILLEY: I appreciate it .
SAM: See how quickly you can clear it up ?
TILLEY: But I do n't understand how the slate gets wiped clean when he eaks into my house and I 'm the one charged .
BB: I told you , I was n't breaking into your house . I was looking fo your wife .
TILLEY: All right all right I 'm too tired the slate 's clean the slate 's clean . The WAITRESS approaches .
WAITRESS: What will you have ?
TILLEY: Couple of eggs over , some hash owns , some toast toasted dark butter on the side , large grapefruit juice and some coffee . The Waitress writes his order .
WAITRESS: We leave them in the shell .
TILLEY: I do n't like them that way because they get hot in the hand and it 's hard to scoop the stuff out it 's not good and you get little bits of shell in there and it does n't taste good .
BB: Why do n't you just order some scrambled eggs and be done with it all right ?
TILLEY: If I 'm going to order , at least I ought to be content with my food .
BB: I 'm getting a little hungry I 've got a headache as it is . Just order some eggs so some othe people can have something to eat efore the lunch trade comes in .
TILLEY: Why do I need a guy telling me what I should or should n't eat ?
BB: This is not a four-star restaurant we 're not having a gourmet meal we 're ordering breakfast , for Christ sake !
TILLEY: It so happens I have n't been to this restaurant before . I do n't know how they do their eggs if they 're over easy and they 're gooey , I 'm not happy with it and I 'm not happy if the soft oiled eggs are left in the shell
BB: Can I have some French toast and a cup of coffee ? Bagel , what do you want ?
TILLEY: Hey ! I 'm ordering here . At least you can have the courtesy to let a man order his breakfast .
BB: French toast and a cup of coffee .
TILLEY: Sam , this guy gets on my nerves from day one ! I knew it then and I know it now .
BB: I 'm back to pressing charges against you ! Tilley turns and is face-to-face with BB .
TILLEY: You want to play that way ? This game ai n't over , mister it ai n't over
BB: All right , you want to finish it now ? You want to finish it right now ? I 'm ready I 'm ready now !
TILLEY: You 're ready ? ! You 're ready , that 's what you 're saying ? ! You 're ready now ? ! I have to be intimidated I have to be brought here to be intimidated
BB: I ca n't stand it any longer . You 're driving me out of my mind .
BAGEL: Come on , guys take it easy take it easy .
TILLEY: Get the people with the straitjackets this man is out of control . Tilley and BB pull at one another .
BB: We 're gon na finish it we 're gon na finish it . Bagel and Sam pull them apart .
SAM: Come on , let 's get out of here . Sam ushers Tilley to the door .
TILLEY: I 'm not finished with him , Sam . You heard me I 'm not finished with you , mister .
BB: So , I 'm having French toast and coffee . Bagel ?
MOE: Know what ?
BB: How did ya know ?
MOE: You mean to make up my mind to marry her ?
BB: Yeah . How did ya know ?
MOE: You turned down a dance ?
BB: What 's the odds on that ? You think you can come up with odds on that one ?
MOE: Hundred to one BB do n't dance a hundred to one against . There 's a beat .
BB: Lot of good times , Moe .
MOE: A lot of good times , but I ca n't live off the good times . You know , my brother-in-law has offered me a job at Hess Shoes . I think maybe I should do it . You get there in the morning , you come home at night you get health enefits I get to be assistant manager .
BB: That 's it , Moe ? You 're gon na spend the day measuring people 's feet ? 'You 're an `` E '' fit you 're a `` D '' wide you got a high arch I 'll show you something in an alligator something with a wing tip ' How can you talk about that all day long ? Moe , you 're the best tin man there ever was . Nobody 's a bette closer .
MOE: It 's over , BB it 's over .
BB: So , May 's happy about this Hess Shoe thing , heh ?
MOE: To say the least .
SAM: You know , when I saw 'Bonanza ' the other day , something occurred to me . There 's those three guys living on the Ponderosa and you never hear them say anything about wanting to get laid . You neve hear Hoss turn to Little Joe and say ' I had such a hard-on when I woke up this morning . ' You know they never talk about broads nothing . Ya never hear Little Joe say 'Hey , Hoss , I went into Virginia City and saw a girl with the greatest ass I ever saw in my life . ' Ya just see 'em walking around the Ponderosa saying , 'Yes , Pa , ' and 'Where 's Little Joe ? ' Nothing about broads . I do n't think I 'm being too picky at least once if they talked about getting horny . I do n't care if you 're living on the Ponderosa o ight here in Baltimore , guys talk about getting laid . I 'm beginning to think that show does n't have too much realism . What do you think , Tilley ?
TILLEY: Sam , I ca n't concentrate on 'Bonanza ' shit
SAM: Yeah , we 'll go and have some lunch at the smorgasbord .
TILLEY: God , if you 're responsible for all the stuff down here , maybe you got a moment 's attention for me . Between the I.R.S. , this Home Improvement Commission and Mr. Marengay , I got it up to here with this bullshit . To be frank with you , I 'm in the toilet here . If you can see your way
WOMAN: I wanted to get some of the salad .
TILLEY: It 's out of order go around .
TILLEY: Do what you can , all right ? I appreciate it . Amen . Tilley helps himself to some salad .
BB: Nora Tilley , please .
CHEESE: Stanley , can I help you look fo something ?
STANLEY: No , I 'm just making myself busy .
CHEESE: Well , I would n't do that . Bagel do n't like nobody looking at the files .
BB: Nora , this is BB .
MASTERS: Did n't you approach Mr. Boloshevski August 18 , 1961 , while he was cutting his front lawn and tell him that his house had been selected , as one of only 16 homes in the state of Maryland , for a free aluminum siding job ?
TILLEY: What 's the name again ?
MASTERS: Boloshevski .
TILLEY: Does n't ring a bell . Sam , does it ring a bell to you ?
SAM: It does n't ring a bell to me either , sir .
MASTERS: Did n't you suggest that for a nominal labor charge , he would eceive over five thousand dollars ' worth of aluminum siding ?
TILLEY: That 's an awful lot for nothing . Does n't sound like good business to me .
MASTERS: Mr. Boloshevski was ultimately charged twenty-four hundred dollars for labor , which according to our figures is about the average cost of an aluminum siding job .
SAM: I do n't get the point of this .
MASTERS: Twenty-four hundred dollars that you charged for labor , is the same as if Mr. Boloshevski had purchased the aluminum siding and had the labor done .
TILLEY: Maybe I 'm missing the point here , ut if he paid twenty-four hundred , which is the cost of the job , I ca n't see anything wrong with that . I do n't know the guy , but I do n't quite get the problem .
MASTERS: What we 're getting at here what we 're trying to stress , is that the job was sold under false terms . The man did n't win any award he was not getting aluminum siding at a special price . A clear case of deception was involved here .
TILLEY: What 's he talking about ? The man got the job for twenty-four hundred dollars , and that 's what it costs in aluminum siding .
SAM: I 'd go along with that as well .
MASTERS: What we 're trying to establish are the principles that have been laid down as part of the Home Improvement code of ethics that you can not mislead someone intentionally , and I think that 's the principle that applies to this .
TILLEY: Did somebody put a gun to this guy 's head and make him spend twenty-four hundred dollars ? I do n't get the point here . I do n't know the specifics of this case , not being privy to all the information , but all I can say is this guy got a fair price for a fair job .
DELANEY: Do you know Mr. and Mrs. Rayburn of 156 Aberdeen Avenue , Essex ?
TILLEY: I think you 'd have to familiarize me .
DELANEY: The couple purchased twenty-eight hundred dollars ' worth of aluminum siding and the two of you were the salesmen on record . They say , and I quote here , 'that they would have received one hundred and fifty dollars per home for every person in the neighborhood who saw their house and decided to uy aluminum siding . ' Is that true ?
TILLEY: It sounds right .
DELANEY: Are you aware that , according to the Home Improvement code , you are not allowed to exceed a twenty dollar limit in incentives ?
TILLEY: We wanted to be a little more generous , that 's all .
DELANEY: The couple said that they neve did receive any money from any other jobs , as you had promised .
SAM: We did n't get any leads from them . Their house was not the showplace that we thought it would be . It did n't generate the activity that we had hoped .
TILLEY: But should a referral turn up in the community , we 'd be more than happy to give them twenty dollars instead of the hundred and fifty .
MASTERS: Excuse us for one moment .
TILLEY: Glad we could be of some service .
SAM: I need a drink . I hate inquisitions .
NORA: I do n't want to see you anymore .
BB: I got ta talk to you .
NORA: I do n't want to listen .
BB: Give me a chance to explain . You owe me that much .
NORA: I do n't owe you anything .
BB: It was a lousy thing to do , okay ? It was a lousy thing to use you to get back at your husband but the fact is that I never would have met you otherwise . Nora stops and turns to look at BB .
NORA: What kind of a person would come up with such a devious thing ?
BB: I 'm not always a nice guy , I admit that . I got a lot of training in deceit it 's an occupational hazard .
NORA: I 'd like to know what it is about me that I have to fall for tin men . What kind of character flaw do I have ?
BB: I did n't want to have to come here . I wish that I did n't have to ever see you again . I 've gone this far in my life without having to have this kind of thing happen to me . I was going through life , sailing along , pretty good doing okay , and I tried to get even with some crazy guy and I 'm here .
NORA: The wet becomes you . Gets rid of some of the slickness .
BB: I do n't like the idea that I 'm not in control of this , but if this stuff 's got to happen , I guess I 've got no choice . I wan na ya know I wan na be with ya ! Okay , I said that I said it , okay ? ! I wan na be with ya ! It pisses the hell out of me , and I 'm gon na tell you that to your face , but I want to be with you because I miss you and I 'd like to live with you I 'd like to marry you and that 's that !
NORA: I was hoping for something a little more romantic but , okay . A slight smile comes to BB 's face .
SAM: Ya know , Tilley , we been working together for over a year .
TILLEY: Yeah , must be about that .
SAM: I 've been thinking that sometimes a different combination makes fo etter luck . Ya know what I mean ? I mean , maybe the two of us ai n't the right combination .
TILLEY: I 'm just getting used to ya , Sam .
SAM: Let 's face it , we 're not exactly setting the world on fire .
TILLEY: It 's a slump it 's a slump , Sam .
SAM: Maybe it 's a slump , but like aseball , some time they have to change the lineup to get the team going again .
TILLEY: You 're not serious about this , are you , Sam ?
SAM: Yeah .
TILLEY: You 're serious ? You wan na get another partner ? You do n't think I 'm gon na pull out of this ?
SAM: I know you 're gon na I know you 're gon na .
TILLEY: So ?
SAM: Look , we beat the Commission today you know , we got a little bit of a victory . We split right now and maybe we can add to that you know what I 'm saying ?
TILLEY: I know I know . Change in the lineup . Okay , maybe it 'll help maybe it 'll help . You got any ideas for a new partner ?
SAM: Well , I had a conversation with Solly Shavitz , so maybe I 'll go with him . Mouse is gon na need a new partne ecause Dennis is going into used cars .
TILLEY: Mouse ! Mouse ! He gets on my nerves He eats too much . Here 's to some pretty good times , huh ? Sam smiles .
LOONEY: I do n't get it the broad smashes into his car and he takes her dancing . Some kind of dating itual that I 'm not familiar with .
STANLEY: BB 's a pretty good tin man , huh ?
LOONEY: Pretty good ? Whew ! Man 's what legends are made of . Started selling pots and pans door to door at sixteen . Nothing he ca n't sell .
BB: You 're gon na come back and stay the night ?
NORA: I dunno all my things are back at Nellie 's the other side of town . I know what I could do , I 'll go ack to the house there 's still a few things I left behind at least I can get a change of clothes . They both sit down . BB looks at Nora .
BB: I 'm glad this is working out .
NORA: You really happy ?
BB: Yeah .
NORA: You do n't really show a great deal of exuberance .
BB: Honey , for me I 'm a parade .
NORA: What happened ?
TILLEY: The I.R.S they need my furniture . They got some living oom somewhere in this country that needs to be furnished .
NORA: They 're taking the furniture ?
TILLEY: The furniture , the whole house . They locked it up they confiscated it .
NORA: What do you expect ? You expect to get some preferential treatment you 're some special case ? You 've got to pay your taxes just like everybody else has to pay their taxes ! Tilley shrugs .
TILLEY: We had a lot of arguments .
NORA: There 's a responsibility that you 've got to have . It 's a long way from high school , Tilley .
TILLEY: I was doing pretty good there fo a while doing pretty good . Had my house , had a wife , a Cadillac I still got my Cadillac .
NORA: Where are you gon na sleep ?
TILLEY: I 'll stay at Sam 's for a couple of days until I get set up . What 're you doing here , anyway ?
NORA: There 's just a couple of things you did n't throw out of the house a couple of things I did n't find in the drawer .
TILLEY: I do n't know I did a pretty good house cleaning number on you .
NORA: Listen , about the divorce . Do you want to file , or should I file ?
TILLEY: I got to be frank with you , this guy is nuts .
NORA: He told me all about it all about how you threw eggs at him .
TILLEY: He told you it was about eggs ? The guy tried to break into my house . He tried to steal things from me .
NORA: He was trying to find me . We had an argument .
TILLEY: I think you 'd be making a big mistake if you married him .
NORA: It 's not for you to make decisions for me .
TILLEY: I think maybe I should , because I think you 're being misled I think you 're confused . I think
NORA: I know what I 'm doing .
TILLEY: Nora , listen to me . I know about guys
NORA: I appreciate your concern , but it 's not for you
TILLEY: But this guy is as bad a choice as you could make . Bad choice .
NORA: You 're a good one to give advice you 're sitting on the steps , locked out of your house because you ca n't pay your taxes , and you 're going to give me advice on life ?
TILLEY: I 'm not giving you a divorce , and that 's it . I 'm looking out fo your welfare . No divorce .
NORA: My benefit ! You do n't give a damn about me ! You do n't give a damn who I marry . The reason you do n't want me to marry is ecause he 's the one taking you wife , and you 've got your own problems with him .
TILLEY: What footstool ?
NORA: The hand-embroidered footstool over by the TV .
TILLEY: I do n't remember seeing that .
NORA: It 's been there forever it was my granny 's .
TILLEY: It 's been there forever ? I 've never seen it .
NORA: You 've never seen it ! ? You 've never seen it ! ? You put your feet on it to watch TV the hand-embroidered footstool .
TILLEY: I do n't know what you 're talking about . I never put my feet up to watch TV .
NORA: That 's the way you are , Tilley , it does n't mean anything to you . You do n't care if they take it all away . It 's all you , Tilley ! That 's the way it 's always been .
TILLEY: Hand-embroidered footstool ?
STANLEY: Thanks for the lift back , BB . See ya around .
BB: You know something , Stanley , I can always smell a guy who 's not made of tin . He walks over to Stanley .
STANLEY: I 'll put everything back , nobody 's the wiser .
BB: You work for the Commission , is that it ? Stan nods `` yes . ''
STANLEY: Well , we just started out , and if we had some really good hard facts of some infractions , it would give us a lot of credibility in the community .
BB: You know what your big problem is , Stanley ? You 're lazy . If you want to find out stuff , then you dig you get on the phone you canvas 'We 're from the Home Improvement Commission ' Go find your leads that 's what we do all the time . You 're just lazy , Stanley . If we 're doing something wrong , you should collect all your evidence . Instead , you snoop around steal files . What is this ? Undercover time ? You think you 're breaking up some big drug ing ? Is this the Mafia you 've infiltrated ? All you 've got here is a bunch of guys selling tin for Christ sake ! You want some files ?
BB: Here here 's some jobs I did . Leave Moe out of this he quit the business . Stanley gathers up the files from the desk .
STANLEY: Why are you doing this ?
BB: If it 's not gon na be you , it 's gon na be somebody else and if it 's not tonight , it 's gon na be another time .
NORA: Maybe if I talked to him anothe day he 'll change his mind . I mean , he 's like that one day , he 's this way and another day he 's that way .
BB: You do n't need to talk to him .
NORA: I mean , he 's probably , you know , upset about the I.R.S . taking the house and all our stuff . After a beat .
BB: Ever see a Volkswagen ?
NORA: What ?
BB: You know , those little Volkswagens .
NORA: What does that mean ?
BB: It 's a car a little car .
NORA: What does that have to do with anything ?
BB: I dunno they 're interesting .
NORA: What ?
BB: It 's interesting .
NORA: What 's so interesting about a car ?
BB: I dunno . It 's a little thing you know , a little thing . Guy tells me they do n't even have adiators they 're air-cooled .
NORA: Yeah ?
BB: It 's interesting different something new . I like it .
TILLEY: Tilley and Mouse . It looks weird , does n't it ? Looks very weird .
WING: Let 's hope you have some bette luck with Mouse .
GIL: Mr. Marengay .
BB: Can I talk to you in private , o do I have to talk to you ove fourteen pool tables ? Tilley moves down the hall toward BB .
BB: We 've got enough that 's going down between the two of us , but the fact of the matter is that I love your wife , and I want to marry her .
TILLEY: I do n't care who she marries , ut I do n't want her marrying you !
BB: Why do n't we just talk about this in a nice , rational manner .
TILLEY: Rational ? You 're going to be ational ?
BB: We 've got our problems , but let 's try and isolate this particula situation .
TILLEY: Isolate isolate I like this kind of talk . What the hell nonsense is that ?
BB: What are you gon na gain from this thing here ?
TILLEY: Now let me see here I 've got to isolate that for a moment and think it over .
BB: Nobody 's going to benefit from making me mad .
TILLEY: You ought to hear yourself . You know that ? You ought to listen to the way you talk . You come in here , you want to take my wife you want to isolate this situation you want to be ational . I 've got no tolerance for you , mister . You know what I 'm saying ?
BB: What you 're saying is you do n't want to discuss this , am I ight ?
TILLEY: You like pool ?
BB: I enjoy the game .
TILLEY: Why do n't we play a little game of eight ball ? If I lose , I consent to the divorce if you lose , you give Nora up walk away from her . BB stares at Tilley ; Tilley eyes BB .
BB: Rack 'em .
TILLEY: Yes , sir ! Yes , sir !
BB: You make this one here , and you win .
TILLEY: Do n't I know it do n't I know it !
BB: Bad break .
TILLEY: Tough break .
BB: Yeah that puts an end to one of our differences . Now , concerning you
TILLEY: Yeah ?
BB: I 'm gon na beat the crap out of you . You want it here or do you want it outside ?
TILLEY: Outside .
BB: I think our business is finished .
GIRL #1: Improves the insulation
GIRL #2: We 'll have a representative in your area
LOONEY: Danny 's an example of that . Danny goes into a bar , chicks lined up and down the bar . Walks up to one and says , 'Honey , would you like to fuck ? ' She 'd slap him in the face . He 'd move down to the next girl , say the same thing she 'd slap him . Then he 'd just keep moving down , going from one girl to the other . Fifteen , maybe sixteen girls would tell him to get lost to get the hell out of there
LOONEY: And he always gets what he wants . Looney looks up and sees BB 's face .
BAGEL: Looks a little too romantic fo me . He walks back to his office .
CHEESE: You know who 's no longer married to who ?
CARLY: Well , we ought to know . There 's like a million fucking people living in Baltimore . How many guesses do we get ?
NICK: LOONEY
CHEESE: Ed and Ethel are n't that MAN
BAGEL: CHEESE Want me to find out what
BB: LOONEY Yeah yeah . Essex .
BAGEL: CARLY Because ever since Moe
LOONEY: Yeah . BB Thanks for the concern , CARLY Bagel , but I 'll be all You 're kidding me . right .
CARLY: We 'll get to that once we 've discussed Wilma they 'll still be broken up we 'll get to that in a minute .
LOONEY: How do you know Wilma ?
TILLEY: Hey , Wing , is n't that the putz from the Commission ? Points to car driving out of parking lot .
WING: Masters ? Yeah .
TILLEY: What the hell 's he doing hanging around here ?
WING: He wants information .
TILLEY: I nailed his ass the other day , Wing . Ca n't lay a finger on me . I was amazing , you should have een there . I was amazing I was respectful , courteous , but I was slipping and sliding they could n't touch me .
WING: I got a real problem , Tilley . Come inside , I 'll buy you a drink .
TILLEY: You 're gon na sell me out to the Commission ? Wing , am I hearing this right ?
WING: I 'm up front with you about this I 'm up front with ya , Tilley . I 've got my balls in a vice what am I gon na do ?
TILLEY: Is this about the money I owe you ? Are you just pissed ? You want to get even because of the horse race ? I told ya it was an accident .
WING: Tilley , it 's got nothing to do with the money .
TILLEY: You 're selling me out ? You 're gon na let them bury me ? Jesus Christ , Wing Jesus Christ ! I 'm not gon na be able to work in this business ? Wing , this was my chosen field !
WING: Masters was gon na take this company apart . You 're the low man on the totem pole , Tilley . There 's a lot of guys earning a good living no sense for it all to go up in smoke . You understand , do n't you , Tilley ? It 's just usiness .
TILLEY: Jesus Christ !
WING: Listen , Tilley , you owe me sixteen plus from the race , and you 're in for over two grand on the books , so I tell you what I 'll wipe the slate clean .
TILLEY: You 'd sell me out for a lousy three thousand dollars ? Three thousand dollars and I got to go down the toilet ? Jesus Christ , Wing , how long the two of us een busting our asses togethe Jesus Christ ! We got some history to this relationship fo Christ sake . Masters puts a little squeeze on you , you just sell out . Three thousand dollars ? !
WING: The bottom line is , I 'm running a business , Tilley . Here 's another deuce . I carried you a long time , Tilley . I 've done a damn sight more than a lot of other guys would have done for you and I do n't see no gratitude from you . He gets up to leave .
WING: You can finish up whenever you like . I 'm sorry , Tilley . That 's the way of the world . He pats Tilley on the back and walks away .
NORA: I ca n't believe that you 're up so early . This is a rare occasion .
BB: Yeah . I just got some business downtown I got ta take care of .
NORA: Toast will be ready in a second . Coffee 's on the table .
BB: Listen , Nora . I um I e lied to you the other day .
NORA: How so ?
BB: I went to see Tilley about the divorce . She turns to look at him .
NORA: What ? !
BB: We played pool . If I won he 'd give you up , if I lost I 'd give you up .
NORA: You played pool for me ?
BB: Nora , I had no choice .
NORA: It 's the most despicable thing I 've ever heard in my life . I mean , it 's disgusting guys shooting pool to determine my future .
BB: Nora , I had no choice ! Hand me the toast .
NORA: Get the toast yourself . BB takes the toast out of the toaster .
BB: I 'm just trying to be honest . It 's been on my mind on my conscience . He picks up a plate .
NORA: Why do n't you take both maybe you can choke to death on one of them .
NORA: How can you be so how can you not understand how wrong that is ? I ca n't understand that mentality ! Shoot pool for me ! It 's insane . BB dips his toast into his eggs .
BB: Tilley is not the most rational man in this world . I tried to talk to him he would n't listen . So , what are my options ? You know what I 'm saying ? What are my options ?
NORA: I ca n't believe you had to shoot pool ! Do n't you understand that do n't you understand how crazy that is ? You 're sitting there you 're eating your eggs as if it 's normal business in life here ! Like feudal lords o something you used to read about in history books .
BB: All right , I 'm sorry . Beat .
NORA: What happened ?
BB: I lost . He dips more toast into his eggs and eats .
NORA: You lost ?
BB: I blew the eight ball .
NORA: You lost ?
BB: Yeah .
NORA: What does that mean ?
BB: It means I 'm supposed to give you up , and I 'm never supposed to see you again .
NORA: Will you stop eating the eggs fo a minute ! How can you tell me things like this and casually eat your eggs ? ! What does this mean , Bill ?
BB: Well , I 'm supposed to give you up as part of honoring that agreement , but I 'm not that honorable a guy . He smiles , takes a quick sip of his coffee .
NORA: Why are you running off so fast here ?
BB: I told you , I got some business downtown .
TILLEY: You got ta testify , huh ?
BB: You ?
TILLEY: Yeah .
BB: You got a lawyer ?
TILLEY: Nah . I already testified once . I beat 'em before , I 'll beat 'em again . You got a high-priced mouthpiece to speak for ya ?
BB: I do n't need one . I do n't expect to win .
TILLEY: How so ?
BB: I gave them some pretty incriminating evidence .
TILLEY: You gave them evidence ?
BB: The only way I could think to get out of this business . He smiles .
TILLEY: Hey , that 's good that 's good , yeah . There 's activity in the hallway .
BB: She 's doin ' all right . A MAN comes out of the hearing room .
MAN: Ernest Tilley ?
TILLEY: Yeah here . Take good care of her .
MASTERS: Are you aware that that 's a violation of sections 258 and
TILLEY: I 'm not aware of the section numbers . Sometimes you get a little overzealous in the heat of the sales pitch , that 's all .
ON TILLEY: who is falling apart .
TILLEY: As I remember , no sale was made concerning those customers .
MASTERS: It fell out because a loan could n't e arranged , but the people did agree in principle . The point that we 'd like to stress , is that you misled these people . Told them the job was free . Then you sent in your closer with some cover story about how you had suffered a nervous breakdown , and a sale was ultimately made fo twenty-three hundred and seventy- seven dollars . That is misleading and deceptive sales practice .
TILLEY: It was temporary insanity . I do n't know it just came over me it might have been something I ate . I do n't know it was crazy , I 'm the first to admit it was a crazy thing to do . Believe me
MASTERS: We have other specific examples of deceptive sales practices on you ehalf concerning a job carried out on December 11 , 1962 . You violated sections 241 and 247 . And concerning a job sold to Mr. and Mrs. DeFranco on October 9 , 1962 , violations of sections 251 and 257 took place .
TILLEY: What are all these numbers here ? I 'm not familiar with all these section violations .
ON BB: who is watching the proceedings intently .
MASTERS: It is the decision of this commission to revoke your license to sell aluminum siding
TILLEY: Are you sure ? Maybe the guys want to think this over .
MASTERS: Thank you , Mr. Tilley . You may hand over your license to the clerk of the commission on you way out .
MASTERS: Will Mr. William Babowski please come forward .
BB: I do not wish .
KID: Did you have a car parked here ? A Cadillac ?
TILLEY: Yeah . What about it ?
KID: A man told me to say they took it .
TILLEY: Who took it ?
KID: Man said , the tax man . Gave me a dollar to tell you so .
TILLEY: Tax man ! Fucking I.R.S . How low can you get ? How low can you get ?
MASTERS: I think with the number of violations on your record , Mr. Babowski , this commission has no ecourse but to revoke your state license .
BB: BB Thank you .
TILLEY: Yeah . You in there ?
BB: Yeah . They got my license as well .
TILLEY: Sorry to hear it .
BB: What are you doing standing there ?
TILLEY: This is where my car used to be .
BB: Stolen ?
TILLEY: I.R.S . Fucking bandits ! Bandits ! Thieving sons of bitches ! BB looks at Tilley for a beat .
BB: You need a ride uptown ?
TILLEY: I could use one .
BB: Come on .
TILLEY: Some bullshit commission , huh ? Tell me , where 's it written it the Constitution that says you ca n't hustle for money ? Where 's it written ? It ai n't like I went into an alley and hit a guy ove the head with a brick and stole his money not like I broke into somebody 's house and stole his stuff . All I 'm doing is selling where 's the crime in that ?
BB: I do n't know what the world 's coming to .
TILLEY: You 're telling me . I do n't know what the world 's coming to .
BB: You know what our big crime is ? We 're nickel and dime guys . We 're small time hustlers . They got us ecause we 're hustling nickels and dimes .
TILLEY: Nickels and dimes . You got a good point there , BB . You 're right on the money with that kind of thinking .
BB: Got ta find a new business to get into .
TILLEY: New ? Very hard to find something new to get into .
BB: Maybe maybe not .
TILLEY: Better put on my thinking cap not easy to think of something new .
MAGYAR: And porkolts . You know porkolts ?
JIM PRIDEAUX: Yes , I 've had it .
MAGYAR: It 's very good . Better than goulash . But you wo n't get it in Budapest now .
JIM PRIDEAUX: Why 's that ?
MAGYAR: All the pigs have gone to Moscow .
JIM PRIDEAUX: When do I get to meet you friend ?
MAGYAR: I 'll take you to him . Not eating ?
JIM PRIDEAUX: Would you excuse me a moment ?
KGB MAN: No firing !
PERCY ALLELINE: I wish I could have done more , Control .
CONTROL: You did all you could , Percy . Well , a man should know when to leave the party .
TOBY ESTERHASE: What about Smiley ?
CONTROL: Smiley is leaving with me .
BILL HAYDON: You little prick Esterhase .
POLYAKOV: Shall we begin ?
LACON: This is private property . Who are you ?
RICKI TARR: Minister Lacon . He smiles .
LACON: What do you want ?
RICKI TARR: I want to talk to Control . And I want breakfast .
PETER GUILLAM: Has that been cleared ?
BILL HAYDON: I 'm not bloody chaining it outside . Mind you , probably no safer in here , with you bunch of cut-throats .
HAYDON: Thought I 'd get a glimpse of the new girl . Before Bland gets to her . He seen her yet ?
GUILLAM: Oh yes . Down first thing .
HAYDON: You may fuck me , Belinda , but you still have to call me sir in the morning .
PETER GUILLAM: Peter Guillam
SMILEY: Hello , Peter .
LACON: How 's your mother ?
PETER GUILLAM: Very well . Is this where he got out ?
LACON: Mmm , I came back in and it was wide open . Do send her my love . Apologies fo singling you out , but very sensitive matter He gives an uncomfortable bark of laughter .
PETER GUILLAM: Ricki Tarr , sir . One of my scalp- hunters . He 's been on the wanted list for a year . Last job was Istanbul , bit of coat-trailing fo a Russian convention .
LACON: Why is he on the wanted list ?
PETER GUILLAM: He killed our man in Istanbul . Cut his throat . Been on the run since then . If possible , Lacon looks even more shaken .
LACON: My God . In my own home my family The bloody animals you people employ !
SMILEY: Oh , I think I manage pretty well , thank you .
LACON: Your wife , the lovely Ann ? She 's in the pink , and so on .
SMILEY: Very well . Very bonny
LACON: Do you know this man Tarr ?
SMILEY: I recruited him actually . In Penang . Good with women . Likes to talk . What did he say to you ?
LACON: He said he had some intelligence for Control . Had no idea he was dead . The news obviously had n't eached Wonga Wonga land . Then he said he would only tell it to someone outside the Circus . If he could n't have a Minister , he would settle for the Under-secretary . Lucky me .
SMILEY: I am retired , Oliver .
LACON: Thing is , some time back , when Control was still alive , he came to me with a similar suggestion . Smiley looks at him , surprised .
SMILEY: No .
LACON: I just thought with you being `` his man '' , so to speak .
SMILEY: What did you say to him ?
LACON: I 'm afraid I thought his paranoia had got the better of him and he was pulling his own house down . That does happen in your business . And that bloody mess in Budapest
SMILEY: I 'll keep Peter Guillam . And there 's a retired special branch man . Mendel . I 'd like to have him . Lacon exhales , his relief palpable .
LACON: Yes , yes . Do your own housekeeping . Good man .
SMILEY: No , we never did . We hear the piano playing on as we
MENDEL: Her real name is plain Graham . Added the Pope for a touch of class . Guillam gives a grunt of amusement .
SMILEY: Control lived with his siste did n't he ?
MENDEL: Basingstoke . Not much of a paper- trail as you can imagine . His pension and she owns a block of edsits in her own name in West London .
GUILLAM: We should Mendel flicks another page .
MENDEL: Webb and Bryson are the letting agents . Properties in half of the west end judging by this list
SMILEY: We 're only looking for short term entals . Within the last year .
MENDEL: A Miss Hilliard . L. Cavaleri ? D Weaver , M Crowley , M Cushing . F. Farling . G. Hiaasen .
SMILEY: How long was H. Staunton a tenant ?
MENDEL: Still is . Been renting for a few years now . Something ?
SMILEY: Howard Staunton . Control used to say he was England 's greatest chess master . Died in eighteen seventy- four .
TOBY ESTERHASE: Help you with something Bill ?
BILL HAYDON: Looking for his Majesty .
TOBY ESTERHASE: He 's walking the battlements . Toby 's eyes flicker toward the handset .
BILL HAYDON: Much obliged . Bill leaves , and Toby resumes the call .
ALLELINE: Roy .
BLAND: It 's the Yanks . They want to come in and talk .
ALLELINE: Of course they do . We have Witchcraft . And they do n't .
SMILEY: Thank you . Anywhere will do .
MENDEL: That enough for you to be getting on with ?
SMILEY: No . Peter , I need you to do something for me
KASPAR: Sorry Peter , did n't know you were doing whatever you were doing ?
PETER GUILLAM: Trying not to bleed to death . Fawley 's got a first aid kit in one of his drawers . Get me a plaster will you ?
ROY BLAND: Heard you had an accident . Guillam makes a mental note against Kaspar .
PETER GUILLAM: Cut it on a drawer handle . When are we going to get some new furniture round here ?
ROY BLAND: I 'll have a word with Esterhase , Peter . We 'll make it a priority on the top floor .
PETER GUILLAM: Lunch .
ROY BLAND: Want some company ?
PETER GUILLAM: Smothered by the Mothers .
ROY BLAND: Something like that . Those old irds , all pining for Control . Percy still ca n't get a decent cup of tea out of them . Still , I imagine it takes time .
PETER GUILLAM: What does ?
ROY BLAND: Loyalty . He takes a pull of his pint .
PETER GUILLAM: Here .
ROY BLAND: What do you think of Datsuns ?
PETER GUILLAM: What ?
ROY BLAND: Datsuns . Just got one . Wife made me . Hatchback . Caught sight of myself in it , driving past a shop window and I thought to myself `` Who 's that old fucker ? ''
PETER GUILLAM: Citroen .
ROY BLAND: French ? Ooh la la
PETER GUILLAM: Jerry Westerby , dismissed December 4th . And Connie Sachs , retired November 28th . That 's just two weeks after you and Control were forced out .
SMILEY: I know that car .
LACON: On our way to La Bohème . The Minister wondered if there was anything to report ?
SMILEY: Not much , I 'm afraid . We were just discussing the departure of Connie Sachs . I wonder how Research manages without her .
PETER GUILLAM: Probably relieved . She always struck me as unhinged .
SMILEY: That was one of her talents . LACON looks around him , dripping disdain .
LACON: Looking a little unhinged yourself , George .
SMILEY: Hmm ? He turns to him .
LACON: Control lost his position because of that fiasco in Budapest that poor chap ?
PETER GUILLAM: Jim Prideaux . Smiley nods thoughtfully .
SMILEY: Yes . Yes , he did .
LACON: How did you get this ? This is Witchcraft material .
SMILEY: Control was out . And Alleline was in . Thanks to
SMILEY: Oh , I brought
CONNIE SACHS: Not supposed to . Doctor 's orders .
SMILEY: You left the Circus shortly afte I retired
CONNIE SACHS: I did n't leave . I was dismissed . Chucked out on the rubbish heap . Like you .
SMILEY: Why ? She shrugs , petulant , takes a drink .
CONNIE SACHS: `` Lost my sense of proportion . '' That 's what that personnel cow said . Would n't let go of a bone .
SMILEY: Which bone ?
CONNIE SACHS: Polyakov .
SMILEY: Polyakov .
CONNIE SACHS: Cultural Attaché Polyakov .
SMILEY: Stationed where ?
CONNIE SACHS: Here . London . Turned up in sixty five . And I had a feeling , as soon as I laid eyes on him . But that little swine Toby Esterhase told me I was seeing Spies unde the bed .
SMILEY: Esterhase said that ?
CONNIE SACHS: He had him graded Persil . White than white . And that was that .
SMILEY: But you disagreed ?
CONNIE SACHS: Pretty Polly ? Very military earing for someone who 's neve supposed to have been in the army . But , he was good . Went to Embassy functions , lectures . I love a man who lives his cover . Never put a foot wrong .
SMILEY: Never ? She ca n't help but smile .
CONNIE SACHS: Pretty Polly . Pretty Polly
PERCY ALLELINE: You 're to leave Polyakov alone . You 're becoming obsessed with him .
CONNIE SACHS: Hate the real world . What does it matter ? Old Circus is gone anyway , apart from Bill Haydon . Better off out of it . I know you never liked him .
SMILEY: What nonsense . What on earth makes you say that ?
CONNIE SACHS: I do n't know .
SMILEY: It was the war , Connie .
CONNIE SACHS: A real war . Englishmen could be proud then .
POLYAKOV: He says `` Father , father , I 've just had sex with two 17 year old girls . '' The Priest says `` That 's quite a sin , but you 're an Atheist , General Secretary ''
CONTROL: Step into my lair . And in an instant we are in
SMILEY: Where did you get it ?
CONTROL: I did n't . Percy and his little cabal walked in with it .
TOBY ESTERHASE: Control
CONTROL: Shut up , Esterhase .
SMILEY: If it 's genuine it 's gold-dust . But its topicality makes it suspect .
CONTROL: Smiley is suspicious , Percy . Smells a fake .
SMILEY: Where does it come from ? What 's the access ?
CONTROL: Percy does n't feel like telling .
PERCY ALLELINE: A new secret source of mine .
SMILEY: But how could he possibly have access to ?
PERCY ALLELINE: He has access to the most sensitive levels of policy making .
SMILEY: We ?
CONTROL: Percy and his pals have bypassed us , Smiley . Gone straight to the Minister . Everyone 's very excited . Percy 's to be allowed to keep the identity of his new friend top secret .
PERCY ALLELINE: The Minister agrees with me that too many secrets are blown around here . Too much failure , too many scandals , too little solid intelligence !
CONTROL: Luckily Percy 's cabal has come to save us .
PERCY ALLELINE: It 's all office politics here .
ROY BLAND: Percy does have a point , Control . We should be fighting communism , not each other .
PERCY ALLELINE: Meanwhile we 're losing ou eputation , our partners
CONTROL: Your bloody Yanks !
PERCY ALLELINE: And we 've had enough ! There 's going to be changes , Smiley ! Changes . Toby Esterhase finds his moment .
TOBY ESTERHASE: We need to decide if we 're part of the past , or part of the future .
CONTROL: I should have left you where I found you .
ROY BLAND: Control , if we could all just
CONTROL: OUT ! ALL OF YOU !
SMILEY: If Witchcraft is genuine
CONTROL: I do n't trust miracles .
MENDEL: Courtesy of Mrs P. You been up all night ? Smiley sits down wearily , sips his tea .
SMILEY: Yes .
MENDEL: What 's that ?
SMILEY: Request for a thousand pound 's in cash from the reptile fund .
MENDEL: What for ?
SMILEY: For a Mister Ellis .
MENDEL: Who 's Ellis ? Smiley leans back , rubs his tired eyes .
SMILEY: It was one of Jim Prideaux 's work names .
MENDEL: What 's so strange about that then ?
SMILEY: The date . Prideaux was killed in Hungary a year ago . Octobe twenty first . So why was
PRIDEAUX: Hand those out .
ROACH: Yes sir .
PRIDEAUX: Gave me a turn up there , parked on the horizon . Thought you were a Juju man . What 's your name ?
BILL ROACH: Sir , Roach , sir . Bill . I 'm a new oy .
PRIDEAUX: New arrival , eh ? Middle of year ? What 's the story ? Roach hesitates .
BILL ROACH: My mother and father my father 's left , so
PRIDEAUX: Bill ? The unpaid Bill . Anyone ever call you that ?
BILL ROACH: No sir .
PRIDEAUX: Known a lot of Bills . They 've all een good ` uns . What you good at ?
BILL ROACH: Nothing sir .
PRIDEAUX: You 're a good watcher though eh ? Us loners always are . No one else spotted me when I turned up here . Best watcher in the unit , Bill Roach is , I 'll bet . Long as he 's got his specs on . Right ?
BILL ROACH: Yes sir . Prideaux finishes his drink , nods to Roach .
PRIDEAUX: Free period , is n't it ? Do n't waste it down here .
RICKI TARR: Hello Mister Smiley . You remembe me .
SMILEY: Hello , Ricki . He tosses the wedge onto the table .
RICKI TARR: Losing my touch .
SMILEY: Where 've you been , Ricki ?
RICKI TARR: Here , there . Run out of places now . They 're gon na kill me .
SMILEY: Who is ?
RICKI TARR: Your lot . Or their lot . Whoeve gets me first . I 'm innocent , by the way . Within reason . You going to find him then ? The Mole ?
SMILEY: I 'm going to try . How long have you been here ?
RICKI TARR: Few days . Needed somewhere to hide .
SMILEY: I would n't use my home as a safe house . There 's every chance they 're watching it .
RICKI TARR: Calculated risk Mister Smiley . I wanted to see you , figured you 'd turn up here sooner or later .
SMILEY: What do you want Ricki ?
RICKI TARR: There 's a woman . I want you to trade for her . Get her back from Karla .
SMILEY: What woman ? Tarr finishes his cigarette , lights another .
RICKI TARR: Her name 's Irina .
TUFTY THESINGER: This is going to be a long night .
RICKI TARR: You baby-sit this one . Ricki walks towards us .
SMILEY: You were due to fly home the next day . What did you tell London ?
RICKI TARR: Nothing . Did n't have anything to tell yet . But I could sense it in her .
SMILEY: Sense what ?
RICKI TARR: A secret .
IRINA: I know what you are . A long beat . Tarr waits her out .
SMILEY: What made you so sure she was n't coat-trailing ?
RICKI TARR: We 've all got our strengths . And weaknesses .
SMILEY: She had children in Russia ?
RICKI TARR: That 's why they let her and Boris out . So , I said I 'd tell the Circus .
SMILEY: But you did n't ? Tarr 's smile fades .
IRINA: If I tell you , I 'm putting my life in your hands . The lives of my children ? Do you understand ?
RICKI TARR: I promise .
TUFTY THESINGER: You were supposed to have gone . London stations 's been on to me . They want to know what the hell you 're doing .
RICKI TARR: Fuck off .
SMILEY: And what did your message say , Ricki ?
RICKI TARR: Just that I had a Moscow Centre trained hood wanting to defect .
SMILEY: What else ?
RICKI TARR: I know what I am to the Circus . One of the scalp-hunters . Someone to give the dirty jobs to . I wanted to bring this one in myself .
SMILEY: Yes . I quite see that .
RICKI TARR: I said that she claimed to have information crucial to the well- eing of the Circus .
SMILEY: What happened next Ricki ?
RICKI TARR: I waited for a reply .
RICKI TARR: They put her on a ship . That 's all I know . I 've done a lot of things Mister Smiley , but I do n't know why I keep thinking about her .
SMILEY: Where are you going Ricki ? You said yourself , Karla will be looking for you . I can take you somewhere . Keep you safe . Tarr 's face twists with mirth .
RICKI TARR: Who 's going to keep you safe ?
OLIVER LACON: Percy has always resisted suggestions of wider exploitation of Witchcraft 's intelligence .
MINISTER: Drop the bloody jargon , Lacon .
PERCY ALLELINE: I 've refused to share Witchcraft with our allies , so far , Minister .
MINISTER: Greedy boy .
PERCY ALLELINE: My goal has been to establish his track record beyond all doubt . I think the time has come to approach our American brothers-in- arms .
MINISTER: You think they 'll take us back into bed ?
PERCY ALLELINE: I 'm not interested in a one-off trade . I want on-going access to American intelligence .
MINISTER: Do you think we can get it ?
PERCY ALLELINE: With Witchcraft on our side , I think we can get anything we loody-well want .
CONTROL: Percy . Did you do this ?
PERCY ALLELINE: I followed the recipe .
CONTROL: Smiley ? Where 's Ann ? Get me a lady of taste ? Ann will sort it out .
SMILEY: I 'll go find her .
PETER GUILLAM: You look tired .
SMILEY: Yes . I did n't sleep well . I want you to get something fo me , Peter . I need the duty officer 's log book for last November . I 'm sorry , but I 'm going to have to send you up a floor , into the Lion 's den . If you have the slightest eservation
PETER GUILLAM: Is feeling sick to your stomach a slight reservation ?
SMILEY: If you 're caught , Peter , you ca n't mention me . I 'm sorry , but you 're alone .
MENDEL: You 're clean . Nothing on you ack . Nothing on your conscience .
BRYANT: Mister Guillam ? How 's the family ?
PETER GUILLAM: Fine , Bryant . Up to Registry today .
BRYANT: Okay sir . Yellow one for the bag sir .
PETER GUILLAM: Time you oiled this thing , is n't it ?
JANITOR PETE: New rules . Guillam is briskly frisked .
PETER GUILLAM: Mind the jewels .
JANITOR PETE: Pen and watch sir .
PETER GUILLAM: You do n't look pleased to see me , Bill ?
BILL HAYDON: Why would I be ? You bloody pariah .
PETER GUILLAM: Doing some research . Makes a change from sitting on my arse .
BILL HAYDON: Heard it was quiet down there .
PETER GUILLAM: As the grave . When 're you going to give us something to do ?
BILL HAYDON: Have n't you heard ? Technology 's the future . No need for you apes anymore . I can get you a posting to Northern Ireland if that helps get the blood racing .
PETER GUILLAM: Thanks anyway . Stick to sitting on my arse .
JANITOR ALWYN: Want me to look after that fo you , Mister Guillam ?
PETER GUILLAM: Thanks
JANITOR ALWYN: Got ta give you a chit . The Dolphin 'll kill me if I do n't . New Rules .
PETER GUILLAM: So , chit me .
SAL: What you up to this weekend ?
PETER GUILLAM: Visiting aunts .
SAL: I 'll bet .
JANITOR ALWYN: Telephone sir .
PETER GUILLAM: Oh to hell , who is it ?
JANITOR ALWYN: Outside line , sir . Someone rough . The garage , I think , regarding your car .
PETER GUILLAM: Hello ? Well , damn . Ca n't you do the bloody repair ?
MENDEL: Ca n't be done sir , you 're going to need a new gear box .
PETER GUILLAM: At least get on to the main dealers first
TOBY ESTERHASE: Could we see you Peter ? For a second Guillam ca n't speak .
PETER GUILLAM: Of course .
JANITOR ALWYN: Will do sir .
TOBY ESTERHASE: The Chief will take no calls , please , ladies
MOTHER: We can hear . Toby holds the door open for Guillam .
TOBY ESTERHASE: We are having a conference .
PERCY ALLELINE: Well now young Peter Guillam , are you ready for me finally ?
PETER GUILLAM: Couple of Arab ploys look quite promising . Other than that , getting quite good at ping-pong .
PERCY ALLELINE: Arabs You can rent one but you ca n't buy one . Right Bill ? He looks up from the report . Here it comes
PETER GUILLAM: Fine . We have tea at Fortnum 's every afternoon .
PERCY ALLELINE: I require the matter of you discussion with Tarr . Guillam shrugs .
PETER GUILLAM: I 'll tell him . He 'll be thrilled .
PERCY ALLELINE: What 's that shrug for ?
PETER GUILLAM: But I have n't been seeing him ! So get your facts straight and get
PERCY ALLELINE: So if I told you that Tarr had ecently arrived in Paris would you be surprised ?
PETER GUILLAM: Nothing would surprise me about Tarr .
PERCY ALLELINE: And if I told you we happen to know that thirty thousand pounds mysteriously appeared in his bank account last month , would that surprise you ?
PETER GUILLAM: What for ?
PERCY ALLELINE: Never mind what for ! To muddy the water , that 's what for ! Spread a whole lot of damn nonsense to get us chasing our tails ! The point is this - he 's heading for home . The first peep from him you come to the grown-ups , understood ? Anyone you see at this table . But not another damn soul !
MECHANIC: He 's waiting for you .
MENDEL: All go smoothly did it ? Where we off to ?
PETER GUILLAM: The hotel . I have to see George .
MENDEL: Mister Smiley is n't at the hotel , sir . Change of venue .
TARR: Hello , Mister Guillam , sorry I took so long to come back .
FAWN: Excuse me , sir . Guillam pulls free angrily .
SMILEY: Ricki 's been helping us Peter . He 's been telling us all about his adventures .
PETER GUILLAM: He 's a double , George ! There is no Mole ! The whole thing 's a pack of lies thought up by Moscow . Karla 's bought him for thirty thousand pounds ! He pulls the LOG BOOK out of his file .
SMILEY: As you did take the trouble to steal it
RICKI TARR: S'right .
SMILEY: What was the date ? Tarr hesitates , considering .
PETER GUILLAM: He does n't know because there was no telegram ! The whole thing
RICKI TARR: November 20th . It would have been November 20th . Evening .
SMILEY: November 20th is missing . Someone is covering their tracks Peter . Unless you think that 's just a coincidence ? Guillam looks thrown .
PETER GUILLAM: What about the money ?
SMILEY: Thirty thousand is n't so much fo Karla to pay if it protects his Mole . I 'm afraid someone in the Circus knows all about Miste Tarr and is doing everything they can to discredit him .
PETER GUILLAM: `` Enquiries to the fifth floor . ''
SMILEY: You recognize that handwriting ? That 's Toby Esterhase .
PETER GUILLAM: Why did n't you tell me ? That you had Tarr ?
SMILEY: Secrecy is a habit . Guillam rubs his eyes .
PETER GUILLAM: I should get some rest . And I suppose you should get you eading done . Smiley nods . Does n't move .
SMILEY: What for ?
PETER GUILLAM: I wanted to believe Tarr was lying . All this time , thinking I 'm fighting a war . It 's a sham . Karla won years ago and we did n't even know it .
SMILEY: I met him once . Karla .
PETER GUILLAM: What did he say ?
SMILEY: Think of your wife . You have a wife , do n't you ? I brought you some cigarettes , by the way .
PETER GUILLAM: That was Karla ? And he flew back to die rather than give in ?
SMILEY: Yes . And that 's how I know he can be beaten . Because he 's a fanatic . And the fanatic is always concealing a secret doubt .
PETER GUILLAM: What did he look like ?
SMILEY: That 's the thing . I ca n't emember .
RICHARD: Nearly done . He scores a red line down a piece of work .
ROACH: Time sir ?
PRIDEAUX: Got your specs on Jumbo ?
ROACH: Yes , sir .
PRIDEAUX: Who 's the fellow down there ? Roach stares at the stranger eagerly .
ROACH: Do n't know sir .
PRIDEAUX: Who is he ? Beggarman ? Thief ? Why does n't he look this way ?
CLASS: Best car in England !
BELINDA: Stop it ! Stop it !
KASPAR: Keep your bloody hands off her !
SCALPHUNTER: Christ 's sake , do n't fight over a it of skirt !
JERRY WESTERBY: But that 's the way it is , George , is n't it ? When you 're out , you 're out . Too much of this stuff . He points to a drink on the table before him .
SMILEY: How . I need to talk to you about the night Jim Prideaux was killed , Jerry . You were duty officer , were n't you ? Westerby looks at them both .
JERRY WESTERBY: Yes . Control asked me to man the phones that night . Said someone was doing a special job for the service . He wanted someone from outside he could trust . If anything came in , I was to tell him and only him .
SMILEY: You rang my house ?
JERRY WESTERBY: Just on the off chance you were ack from Berlin .
SMILEY: What did you say ?
JERRY WESTERBY: Just that there 'd been a bit of a crisis . She said you were n't back yet . That was it .
SMILEY: Go on .
JERRY WESTERBY: All hell broke loose - military yelling about Hungarian tank movements on the border , Lacon and the Minister baying at the door . Thank Christ Bill Haydon turned up when he did .
BILL HAYDON: Get out . The room clears .
JERRY WESTERBY: I tried to get hold of you
BILL HAYDON: I just picked up half a story on the ticker-tape at my club Tell me .
JERRY WESTERBY: Jim Prideaux 's been shot .
HAYDON: Get me the Hungarian Embassy .
JERRY WESTERBY: Yes sir
BILL HAYDON: You go and tell your Masters what will happen if one hair on Jim Prideaux 's head is damaged He covers the receiver , turns to Westerby .
JERRY WESTERBY: Any more news on him ? Haydon does n't turn around , head bowed .
BILL HAYDON: We need to go to his flat . Clea out anything linked .
PETER GUILLAM: Haydon heard the news at his club ? Smiley is distant
SMILEY: The Saville .
PETER GUILLAM: At one-thirty ? The ticker-tape would n't be running . Guillam sits , mind racing .
SMILEY: Peter
PETER GUILLAM: Jesus Christ . Haydon ? How could he have known ?
SMILEY: It 's not him , Peter .
PETER GUILLAM: Then how did he know ?
SMILEY: Because he was at my house that night . With Ann .
OLD MAN: Just in case it 's of interest , dear . We are observed . Old Filth in the bushes . Not very subtle ut there you are
SMILEY: Yes . Pleasant enough .
BILL HAYDON: I was just passing , thought I 'd call in . Ann was in bed but she insisted on getting up . She said she 'll be down in a minute .
JIM PRIDEAUX: Come in , Roach . Roach walks in .
ROACH: Sir there 's a stranger parked down on the road . He 's just sitting there .
PRIDEAUX: It 's alright , old fella . Do n't cry . Nobody ever watched like you , did they ? Off you go , now .
ROACH: Are you going to have to leave ? Prideaux stares at him .
JIM PRIDEAUX: I 'll be fine . You get back to bed .
CONTROL: You were n't followed ?
PRIDEAUX: Andras Benedek , Hungarian journalist based in Paris . Control nods thoughtfully . Then
CONTROL: If you 're caught , you keep me out of it . You were acting alone , bit of Private Enterprise . Understood ? Prideaux watches him , very still .
PRIDEAUX: What information ?
CONTROL: Rocketry . Ballistics . Bit of politics . Something in his manner alerts Prideaux .
PRIDEAUX: What else ?
CONTROL: Treasure . He has treasure . The name of the Mole Moscow Centre has planted at the top of the Circus .
SMILEY: Which means I was ?
PRIDEAUX: You were Beggarman .
SMILEY: What did you make of it , Jim ? Control 's theory ?
PRIDEAUX: I thought it was madness . To think any one of you could have een a traitor madness .
SMILEY: But still you went ? Risking you life for a mission you thought was absurd ? Why ? Prideaux does n't answer .
PRIDEAUX: I went because Control asked me to go . It 's called doing one 's duty .
SMILEY: No . They were blown . The story is you blew them to save your own skin .
PRIDEAUX: The Mole . Control 's crazy theory . I was going to bury that so deep , they 'd never get it out of me . Which was a joke .
SMILEY: Why ?
PRIDEAUX: Because they already knew . They wanted to know how far Control had got in his investigation .
SMILEY: What else ?
PRIDEAUX: Circus gossip . Was Percy 's wife still drinking , who was Bland screwing in the office . That sort of thing .
SMILEY: Did they ask about me at all ?
PRIDEAUX: One of them did . Smiley becomes very still .
SMILEY: What did he say about me ?
PRIDEAUX: He had a cigarette lighter . Kept flashing it round for me to see . Showed me the inscription . `` To George , from Ann . All my love . '' He reckoned after Bill 's fling with her , she might want to change the inscription . Smiley does n't flicker .
SMILEY: That was well said .
PRIDEAUX: He gave me a cigarette . Prideaux looks down at his hands .
SMILEY: Jim ? Prideaux still does n't look up .
PRIDEAUX: I thought it was my last one .
MAN'S VOICE: Do you know this woman ?
PRIDEAUX: I do n't know her .
PETER GUILLAM: Who ?
SMILEY: Toby Esterhase .
PETER GUILLAM: You alright ?
SMILEY: Will you watch my back , Peter ? Look out for a solo . Just a feeling I 've had .
PETER GUILLAM: Yes , George . I 'll watch .
RICKI TARR: She said there was a General , work-name Polyakov who was stationed in London . And that Polyakov 's real job was to service the mole . He meets him egularly and takes back information the Mole gives him for Karla .
MINISTER: This meeting is not taking place . Is that clear ?
SMILEY: Perfectly , Minister . There is a house , somewhere in this city , where Alleline and the others meet Witchcraft 's London epresentative . I need the address of that house .
MINISTER: I do n't know what you 're talking about . Smiley stares at him .
SMILEY: It 's Lacon 's advice I 'm following . You told me to follow in Control 's footsteps .
MINISTER: Well , I would n't consider that sound advice , after the bloody mess Control left us with . It 's taken Alleline - and , if I may say so , myself - this long to get us back into the race .
SMILEY: I 'm glad you take some of the credit .
MINISTER: That 's that 's not possible .
SMILEY: Made possible . By you . When he steals our secrets he does it under the very nose of the Circus , in the house which you persuaded the treasury to pay for . I 'm sure you 'll be able to take full credit for that .
MINISTER: Witchcraft 's intelligence is genuine ! It 's been gold !
SMILEY: Just enough glitter , amongst the chicken-feed . Control did n't elieve in miracles and he did n't elieve in Witchcraft . But you were lazy and you were greedy and so you hounded him out of the Circus and you let Karla in .
MINISTER: Oh God We ca n't be made to look like fucking fools again ! Forget Europe , if we have the lack men getting to hear about this on Walla-Wallah News ! What if we find the Mole and we move him sideways , some department where he ca n't do any harm ? Is the Kremlin likely to boast about this ?
LACON: Not in their interests sir . They need the Enemy to look like a threat
MINISTER: Well , tell them to play the game . We do n't go crowing about thei fuck-ups !
SMILEY: We are not the prize . We 're the ait . They turn to him .
MINISTER: What can we do ?
SMILEY: We have one thing the Mole wants .
RICKI TARR: If I go
PETER GUILLAM: You 'll go
RICKI TARR: I want your word you 'll get Irina back . Do n't care who you have to trade . I want a family . Do n't wan na end up like you lot
SMILEY: I 'll do my utmost , Ricki .
TOBY ESTERHASE: What what 's this about George ?
SMILEY: It 's about which Master you 've een serving , Toby .
TOBY ESTERHASE: This is a mistake George , this is all
SMILEY: The files were delivered to a Russian attache , were n't they ?
TOBY ESTERHASE: Yes . And yes , I delivered them .
SMILEY: Operation Witchcraft ? Yes , I know . Esterhase stops , turns to look at Smiley .
TOBY ESTERHASE: Why are we here ? Why are we ?
SMILEY: Who gave you the message for Jim to forget about Tinker Tailor ?
TOBY ESTERHASE: Bland !
SMILEY: To get rid of Connie Sachs ? Westerby ?
TOBY ESTERHASE: Bland or Haydon . I do n't emember . One of them . Maybe Percy . I do n't know who .
SMILEY: You 're just the messenger ? Running between them all . Anything to serve Witchcraft ? Esterhase flinches again .
TOBY ESTERHASE: I did n't know . I swear I
SMILEY: Are you still a wanted man , Toby ?
TOBY ESTERHASE: George !
SMILEY: You picked the wrong side , Toby .
TOBY ESTERHASE: George , you 've got to believe me . I would never I 'm loyal , George . I 'm loyal !
SMILEY: Give me the address . Where do you meet Polyakov ?
MRS MCCRAIG: There 's an air duct . Open and all 's well . Closed and you 're not to enter .
SMILEY: Where is the mike , Mrs McCraig ? She points at the candelabra .
MRS MCCRAIG: Whenever the gentlemen are meeting I record the session . The tapes are sent back to the Circus .
SMILEY: If you 're at all worried you can call Lacon from the basement phone . Let 's try the tape ecorder shall we ?
MACKLEVORE: Guest from London Station , Monsieu Fourcade .
MACKELVORE: The whole service is looking fo you , Ricki . They 'll skin you alive if they find you .
RICKI TARR: Maybe I want them to find me .
MACKELVORE: You can go home now , Ben . Leave the books where they are and put the keys into the machines . I 'll e talking to London presently under my own steam .
BEN: Okay boss . Tarr takes out his gun .
RICKI TARR: Ben stays here .
MENDEL: Tinker
SMILEY: How 's he look ?
RICKI TARR: Read it aloud .
BEN: Personal for Tarr from Alleline
RICKI TARR: That 's the way Percy boy ! You keep stalling . I better warn you Ben , there 's some lousy people in this outfit . Do n't trust a fucking one of them .
SMILEY: I 'm here , Mendel .
PETER GUILLAM: He 's here .
OLIVER LACON: I wo n't have bloodshed . I want absolute calm !
SMILEY: I was assured there would be no coercion .
BILL HAYDON: It 's almost funny George . I know the Inquisitors little bag of tricks . I taught most of them . Do n't mind the tears . Just a eaction . An over-reaction , if you like . Craddox says I 'll be off in a few days . I keep thinking how I 'm going to miss the cricket in Moscow . He weeps again .
SMILEY: If I can .
BILL HAYDON: There 's a girlWould you give he some money for me ? Give her a good cover story . If it helps tell her I love her . It 's all here .
SMILEY: Of course .
BILL HAYDON: There 's a boy too . Bung him a few quid to shut him up . Take it out of the reptile fund .
SMILEY: I did have one or two questions . About Prideaux .
BILL HAYDON: Damn it ! I got him back , did n't
SMILEY: Yes , yes you did . That was good of you . I 'm surprised Karla did n't shoot him . Or do you think he held back out of delicacy towards you ?
BILL HAYDON: Yes , as a matter of fact he did .
SMILEY: To say what ?
BILL HAYDON: So did you . Haydon stares out , lost in thought .
SMILEY: Did Karla ever consider having you take over the Circus ? For a moment Haydon looks rattled .
BILL HAYDON: I 'm not his bloody office boy .
SMILEY: What are you then ? Haydon turns to Smiley , a flash of hauteur .
BILL HAYDON: I 'm someone who made his mark .
SMILEY: Is there anything you want me to pass on to Ann ? For a moment Haydon looks genuinely puzzled .
BILL HAYDON: Oh , that was nothing personal , George , I hope you understand that ? Karla said you were good , the one we had to worry about . But you do have a blind spot .
SMILEY: Up to a point .
BILL HAYDON: Just like us Jim . Best days .
ROACH: I made you something . Prideaux stares at the boot scrape .
PRIDEAUX: I do n't want you hanging around here . Keep away from me from now on . Go and join the others . Roach stands frozen .
SMILEY: Shall we begin ?
WOMAN VILLAGER: You monsters !
PANTERA: We appreciate the generous donation for the continued protection of your village .
PANTERA: Idiota ! Watch where you 're going !
DRIVER SOLIDER: There 's a log on the road , senor . that was n't there an hour ago .

DONATELLO: Moneymoneymoneymoney .
MICHAELANGELO: Domo arigato , dude .
MICHAELANGELO: Sensei ? Oh ! Here ya go , Master Splinter .
DONATELLO: Master . No cake . You remember you last cholesterol tests .
APRIL: Where are you ?
GROGGY: Talk to me .
APRIL: Hey . It 's me . I 'm back .
CASEY: Was that today , babe ? April 's disappointed . Same old Casey .
APRIL: Yes . It was today that I returned to you after being in a deadly jungle for almost a month .
BEAT: I thought you were going to meet me down here ?
CASEY: I 'm sorry , babe . I must've-
APRIL: Forget it . I 'll take a cab .
CASEY: I missed you ?
APRIL: Howie ! Get this on the truck fo delivery ! Let 's go !
ONATELLO: Oh , hi Mikey . You say something ?
MICHAELANGELO: Every day it 's the same thing . Wake up . Birthday party gig . Drive home . Watch TV . Train Rinse . Repeat .
DONATELLO: I know . Is n't it great ?
MICHAELANGELO: Now THAT 'S what I 'm talking about ! Cruising the streets , busting those who hold themselves above the law . But they are n't above HIS .
DONATELLO: Mikey , the man 's practically a criminal himself . Anyone who operates without boundary or rule of law can not be legislated and needs to be reigned in .
RAPHAEL: Whatta we talkin ' about , boys ? Soundin ' a little too egghead fe my tastes .
DONATELLO: I have no problem with the incarceration of those who deserve it , but if someone like Nightwatcher has ultimate power then who makes sure he does n't cross the line ?
MICHAELANGELO: I think he 's COOL .
DONATELLO: Of course you would .
MICHAELANGELO: Keeya ! HATCHAAAAAA ! !
RAPHAEL: Sometimes there are lines that even the police ca n't cross . Someone has to be willing to do what needs to e done . And to do that , fea ecomes a weapon .
DONATELLO: You are such a Neanderthal .
APHAEL: I rest my case .
SCOLDING: Raphael ! If bullying is the only way to argue your point , then perhaps you do not have much of a point to begin with .
APHAEL: Yes , sensei . And quit touchin ' my stuff .
DONATELLO: That was just a startle response and is n't really an indication of fear !
LEONARDO: Mmm home sweet home .
LEONARDO: I have completed my training , master . I am prepared for the next stage .
LEONARDO: I 've missed you too , father .
RAPHAEL: Hey . Raphael eyes Leo and then the medallion .
LEONARDO: Thanks .
RAPHAEL: Well , I 'm goin ' to bed . He leaves .
DONATELLO: Leo ! !
MICHAELANGELO: But I do n't WAN NA pop out of the irthday cake , Mrs. Ro-
LEONARDO: Hey little bro ! a beat ) Mikey ? You can let go now um , Mikey ?
MUTTERING: So bored so bored
MICHAELANGELO: Leo what 's up , bro ?
LEONARDO: Just enjoying being home .
MICHAELANGELO: We do n't see much of ` em anymore . April seems to be working a lot - eww - and Casey seems to be , I dunno , `` different '' lately . Maybe he does n't like having to put the toilet seat down now that they 've moved in together .
LEONARDO: They 're living together now ?
MICHAELANGELO: To be honest with ya , they 're kinda uzzkills to be around .
LEONARDO: Is Casey at least still doing his hockey mask thing ?
MICHAELANGELO: Dunno . Have n't noticed since The Nightwatcher has come home to oost . WOOOOHOOOOOOOO !
LEONARDO: `` Nightwatcher '' ? That some new comic ook you 're hooked on , Mikey ?
RAPHAEL: This should explain most of it . The legacy of the city 's newest hero . Compliments of the fanboy ove there . M
ICHAELANGELO: Joke all you want , Raphy . But train hard and eat your veggies and one day , you too can be as cool as The Nightwatcher , dude .
RAPHAEL: I can only hope , Mikey . I can only hope Leo disapprovingly flips through the book .
LEONARDO: This guy could bring heat on all of us if he keeps this up . Showboating is n't a replacement for justice it 's just self-indulgence . Someone needs to talk to this thug .
ID 1: Yo , Case ? Wan na be goalie ?
CASEY: Nah , you know I work for a livin ' . It 's Star Center or nothin ' else .
KID 2: Whatever ! Let 's get it on !
TOMMY: Sorry dudes .
CASEY: Busted ! Have fun with your mommy oh no .
ASEY: Aw , c'mon April ! We just started !
KID 2: Ca n't Casey stay and play for just five more minutes , Miss O'Neil ? Pleeeeeeease ?
APRIL: Not today , Nate . Mister Jones has to pretend to be an adult for a few hours .
KIDS: Awwwww ! Man ! Baaah !
CASEY: Later boys !
PRIL: I need your help with a delivery .
CASEY: Do you need my funtahstick muscles ?
UNENTHUSED: Heh-heh yeah .
RECEPTIONIST: Mr. Winters . April O'Neil is here .
APRIL: Hello Max .
BEAT: This is my friend , Casey Jones .
CASEY: Actually , It 's Ca-
APRIL: You know , the typical - corrupt government officials , double crossed by a jungle guide , all ending in a heart-pounding chase .
CASEY: Yeah-ha ! The fourth General .
APRIL: The crow-bar .
CASEY: Oh .
SOFT: the gods be praised .
APRIL: Can I ask you a question ?
APRIL: I 've been so grateful for the opportunities you 've given me lately . I 'd probably be still selling antique curios if you had n't visited my shop that day . But I have to ask why the fascination with these particula works of art ? I 'd never even heard of the Legend of Yaotl until we met .
BEAT: It was like blood in the water fo a predator like Yaotl .
ASEY: I was just resting my eyes
APRIL: Quite the story , Max . concerned re Statue ) You do n't think that this could be-
PRIL: Thanks . Um goodbye Max .
CASEY: What ! ? It was a boring story !
APRIL: That is so perfectly CASEY JONES . I give you opportunity . I give you the chance to become a better man . And what do you do with it ?
CASEY: Well , maybe if you were home fo more than four days at a time , you 'd see that I DO N'T WANT ANY OF
APRIL: Casey , you better be careful-
CASEY: Here I am nice enough to help you out , dress in this get-up and all I get is grief ? !
APRIL: Give me strength .
KARAI: As are yours . Most do n't notice us until we decide they will .
ICHAELANGELO: First one to touch old faithful over there-
DONATELLO: -does the other team 's chores for a week . Leo and Raph glare at each other .
MICHAELANGELO: I 'm with Leo !
DONATELLO: Actually , I think you and I should pair up , Mikey .
MICHAELANGELO: You kiddin ' me ? ! I mean , no offense Donnie , but you ai n't exactly the iggest hitter on the bench .
DONATELLO: Just trust me on this one .
LEONARDO: Have you been avoiding me ? Barely seen you since I got home .
RAPHAEL: I been busy .
SARCASTIC: I see . So you 're definitely not upset at me or anything , right ?
RAPHAEL: Why 'd you think that ?
LEONARDO: I do n't know your brother gets to go on a world-wide training mission and you have to stay home . Might upset me too .
RAPHAEL: Are you trying to make me mad ?
LEONARDO: I 'm just saying , I 'd understand if you were upset . Their intensity ESCALATES .
RAPHAEL: You would n't understand the first thing about me , daddy 's boy - OOF ! .
LEONARDO: Is that what this is about ? You think Splinter likes me best ?
RAPHAEL: You 'd love that , would n't you ?
MICHAELANGELO: So nice of you to join us , gentledudes .
DONATELLO: And by the way , I prefer the classic military corner tuck for my edsheets .
ICHAELANGELO: You dudes see that up there ?
MICHAELANGELO: So what now , captain ?
LEONARDO: We need to come up with a plan .
RAPHAEL: Later ! Raph RUNS OFF toward the action .
MICHAELANGELO: Welcome home .
DONATELLO: Guys , I 've got a bad feeling
RAPHAEL: Ahh , let 's take a tiny peek .
MICHAELANGELO: Well , there 's a good/bad news scenario for ya .
ONATELLO: An interesting conundrum . Do we hold dear the value of life and help the Foot regardless of ou tumultuous past ?
MICHAELANGELO: I vote for sitting back and enjoying the show . Whaddaya say , leader boy ?
RAPHAEL: Nah . We kick butt .
EONARDO: Who are YOU ? !
RAPHAEL: Nice of ya 's ta join me .
DONATELLO: Better hit the tunnels , guys .
LEONARDO: Raph . Save it for another day .
KARAI: The `` problem '' is that we were hired to merely patrol the city and eport anything `` strange '' to you .
KARAI: We may be hired help to you , but you should never forget we are the Foot Clan .
GENERAL AGUILA: None , my lord .
KARAI: Just what is this all about ?
ARAI: But why ? Why here ? Why now ?
BEAT: What can I say ? I 'm a lover of animals .
KARAI: Not now . Our business will be handled at a later time
MICHAELANGELO: Dudes , did anyone get the license plate of the thing that hit us last night ? Oi , my head
DONATELLO: Was it just me , or did that creature look familiar ?
RAPHAEL: We coulda taken it if you slackers woulda pitched in sooner .
LEONARDO: Fact remains , Raph , that we should have never been there in the first place .
APHAEL: Well , I suppose that we shoulda let Mr. Cuddly-kins continue to spread happiness throughout the city oh wait HE WAS A FREAKING MONSTER TRYIN ' TA KILL US ! ! ! Good call , fearless leader .
ONATELLO: Come to think of it , it WAS pretty strange to see the Foot too . And who was that woman ?
MICHAELANGELO: I dunno , but she sure gave Leo a un for his money .
LEONARDO: This is my fault now , Raph ? I 'm the only one who has to be responsible !
RAPHAEL: Hey , you 're the `` trained master '' , not me .
MICHAELANGELO: Dudes-can-it-here-comes-Splinter .
TURTLES: Morning , sensei . Splinter makes himself a TEA . Room is SILENT .
LEONARDO: Hothead .
RAPHAEL: Splinter-junior .
LEONARDO: But Master Splinter , how can I be expected to do so when Ra-
ICHAELANGELO: I 'm personally worried about a monster running around the streets of New York . But hey , that 's just me . Don elbows Mikey back in line .
RAPHAEL: We hafta go out and find who 's esponsible for this . There ai n't no other solution .
LEONARDO: Save the brute vigilante junk fo that Nightwing guy .
LEONARDO: Whatever .
CASEY: Nah . Ever since you started with the blade weapons you , um you kinda scare me .
APRIL: Suit yourself . Case ?
CASEY: Yeah ?
AWKWARD: Are you happy ? I mean , with you life . With me . Casey pauses a beat . Tries to be upbeat .
CASEY: Yeah . Sure . You ? April thinks just as much .
APRIL: Yeah .
CASEY: I 'm going outside for some air .
APRIL: Be safe .
IGHTWATCHER: Funny how you jerks do n't care about crossing the line ` til someone else does it all ove yer HEAD !
NIGHTWATCHER: Boy , oh boy , did YOU pick the wrong night to be a criminal Night cocks his fist just as-
CASEY: Are you that Nightwatcher fella ? A little smaller than I expected .
RAPHAEL: Case ? No way !
CASEY: I 'm talkin ' to you , pal . You think you own these rooftops ? Well , lem me teach you a thing ' r two . Class is Pain 101 . Meet you instructor Casey Jones .
GRINNING: You keep on playing with fire , little man , you might just get urnt .
CASEY: Raph ? ! Is that you ? ! What-what are you doing ? !
THINKS: Are you pretending to be
CASEY: Why would you- -oh . So that would mean
RAPHAEL: Yep .
BEAT: Papers called me `` The Nightwatcher '' , so I went with it .
ASEY: `` And a legend was born '' . So what was your handle before that ?
RAPHAEL: I kinda liked `` The Midnight Marauder ''
CASEY: Stick with Nightwatcher , ninja boy .
THEN: The guys ever catch on ?
RAPHAEL: Pfft . You kiddin ' me ? Leo 's been away for , like , forever . And the other two are so wrapped up in that party business they 'd never notice .
BEAT: So what about you ? How 's things with April ? Have n't seen ya 's since you two moved in together
CASEY: They 're good I guess . I dunno , seems like all I do lately is just make her upset . She used to laugh so much now it 's mostly just working all day , and coming home to point out how I 'm a screw up . She does n't like me doing this . And I know she 's pretending to not know I 'm out tonight . But she knows . And she knows I know she knows . Life just kinda got complicated suddenly y'know ?
RAPHAEL: Yer tellin ' me Casey looks at his old bud .
CASEY: Raph ?
RAPHAEL: Yeah ?
CASEY: Nice to see ya , man .
RAPHAEL: For old time 's sake ?
CASEY: What the shell .
DISAPPROVING: Bro . Seriously .
CASEY: I think we lost it .
RAPHAEL: It 's got ta be around here somewhere .
RAPHAEL: Did I mention we ran into a monste last week ?
RAPHAEL: Nope . Those are a first for me too . We can take ` em .
CASEY: On second thought
ENERAL GATO: Witnesses .
GENERAL AGUILA: Fetch .
CASEY: Not good .
NIGHTWATCHER: You ever heard of smoke pellets ?
CASEY: Hey - you 're the ninja , not me !
RAPHAEL: Bingo . Raphael quickly dashes left through TRAFFIC !
CASEY: What are we gon na do , Raph ? WHAT
RAPHAEL: Hop on .
CASEY: Um , Raph ?
ASEY: Okay , so it was great seein ' ya again , Raph .
BEAT: Raph ?
CASEY: Got ta get you someplace safe , pal . And then , then I need to go buy some new undies .
APRIL: Casey , I think we need to talk . I do n't want- whoa .
CASEY: Could use a little help here
WEAK: Hey April how ya been ?
ICHAELANGELO: My compliments to zee chef .
BEAT: Le brrrraaaaaaapp !
MICHAELANGELO: Anyone for dessert ?
BEAT: We 'll be right there .
ICHAELANGELO: Whoa I am in the wrong line of work . Nice pad , kids . Don immediately starts checking Raph out .
DONATELLO: His vital signs seem to be okay . Pupil dilation is normal . Raph weakly pushes Donnie 's head away .
WEAKLY: Get the frig offa me .
DONATELLO: Temper is normal too . He 's going to be fine . Health-wise , I mean . Otherwise , he 's still the same old Raph .
BEAT: Whoa .
DONATELLO: Some sort of stone probably obsidian , I think .
CLOSER: There 's an engraving on it . Looks South American . Aztec ? No . It 's definitely not Mayan . April swallows hard .
APRIL: It ca n't be .
DONATELLO: What ca n't be , April ?
CASEY: Would it help things if I said that we were being chased by a one of those statues you collected fo that Winters guy ? ON APRIL - Her mouth is agape .
MICHAELANGELO: I 'd say that 's a big ten-four .
MUTTERING: It 's just a myth a legend .
CLOSER: It ca n't be .
CASEY: And I suppose that bringing up the thirty-foot flying monster would probably just push this over the edge , huh ?
LEONARDO: What are you talking about Casey ?
CASEY: Just some story this Winters guy told us . It all started down in South America . Long before the Ashmecks and the Macaroons .
APRIL: Azteks and Mayans .
CASEY: That 's what i said .
APRIL: Sit down , Jones . So there was this guy call Yaotl
MICHAELANGELO: Well ? ! WHAT NEXT ? ! ! !
APRIL: No one knows . The legend stops there .
THINKS: But it 's just a legend .
DONATELLO: The micro-tech of this dart is astounding . The molybdenum is of a grade only found in a few select markets not to mention it 's current stock is going for a little more than two-grand an ounce right now .
EONARDO: So what do we have ? We have someone with a lot of money .
ONATELLO: Access to technology and the means to produce it to exact specs .
RAPHAEL: Not to mention having a keen interest in these monsters and them four stone jokers .
DONATELLO: If you ask me , it all somehow points to Winters Corp .
LEONARDO: How do you figure that , Donnie ?
DONATELLO: Hello ? `` Genius '' ? Well , that , and the fact that this part has a Winters Corporation logo on it .
EONARDO: Do you think he 's trying to ecreate the events from back then ?
RAPHAEL: Well , what would you do with an army of monsters ?
MICHAELANGELO: Well , aside from having your own wrestling league , I dunno MAYBE
LEONARDO: Do bad guys still try to do that ?
DONATELLO: Yes , however they 're usually mortgage re-fi companies .
THEN: What about it , April ? You just finished working with the guy , ight ? Does it make sense ?
APRIL: Guys ! It 's a legend !
MICHAELANGELO: Is that `` legend '' like the ginormous freakin ' hairball that attacked us ?
APHAEL: Or `` legend '' like the moving statues and flying creature that attacked me n ' Casey ?
APRIL: Okay . Fine . I 'll help for now until we prove you 're all insane .
LEONARDO: Or until we prove Winters is up to something more than collecting art .
DONATELLO: I 'll work with April and see if these Stars of Kikin she told us about can give us any clues .
RAPHAEL: I say we just storm the castle and face this jerk in person !
LEONARDO: Raph , that would be the worst idea yet . We hang back . Analyze . Formulate a plan , THEN storm you castle . Are we clear ?
CASEY: Raph . Do n't do it , man .
BEAT: I spent my whole life running out of rooms ticked off at the world . I wish I could take most of ` em back . Sometimes , just takin ' a breathe is the best thing to do .
RAPHAEL: Yeah whatever . - and bolts out the door .
APRIL: I cleaned out my archives on ancient South America . Might have found something useful . She takes out a hand-drawn map .
DONATELLO: For use in an Aztec calendar . So , if we can cross-reference ou current star field , positioning of the Stars of Kikin and backtrack positioning based off of the Aztec
APRIL: -along with taking into account the point of origin of the first occurrence , we should know where another portal could take place . Max , what are you up to ?
MICHAELANGELO: Seriously , dude . We 're all stressed . Try to chill .
LEONARDO: You 're playing video games on the possible eve of Armageddon , Mikey .
INSULTED: But I never said I was having fun . Leo looks at the clock .
LEONARDO: Where 's Raph ?
DONATELLO: We 're almost done , Leo . You might want to go get him If you can find him , that is .
SINGING: Monay , monay , monay , MONAYYYY monay !
TREASURE HUNTER: Pfft . Figgers . He turns to leave the beach .
GENERAL AGUILA: Two creatures remain , my lord . A long beat . Winters closes his eyes .
NIGHTWATCHER: Hey there little fella . All that commotion for just little ole y-
NIGHTWATCHER: Yeah ! That 's what I thought ! Do n't mess with the Nightwatcher !
DINER COOK: Pl-pl-please do n't hurt me !
NIGHTWATCHER: Whattaya talkin ' about ? I JUST
DINER COOK: Please , sir . I have kids .
NIGHTWATCHER: There ya go , pal . Make sure this is safe . HEY - YOU HEARIN ' ME ?
NIGHTWATCHER: This night just keeps gettin ' etter n ' better
LEONARDO: Nice try , amateur .
EONARDO: so I 'm going to give you one chance to just walk away and stop this vigilante nonsense .
NIGHTWATCHER: Okay , Leo . Wan na play ?
LEONARDO: What ? How did you-
THINKS: What ?
PACES: Well , I got ta newsflash for ya - we got along just fine without you .
LEONARDO: I was training ! Training to be a etter leader ! For you ! Why do you hate me for that ? !
RAPHAEL: and whoever said I wanted to be led ? I shoulda gone on that training !
RAPHAEL: Well , big brother , I 'd have to disagree with you on that one .
GENERAL SERPIENTE: The final creature .
GENERAL GATO: It is neither monster nor human . CLOSE ON AGUILA - He manages a small smile .
GENERAL AGUILA: Then he shall perfectly serve ou purposes let us inform ou commander that the final creature has been captured .
RANTING: I was out , and did something something happened and I- ARRRGH ! ! !
RAPHAEL: I did something I did something eally stupid , Master Splinter .
THINKS: And I think I made things worse tonight . A WHOLE lot worse I know you must be ashamed of me , father .
RAPHAEL: But Master Splinter , I messed up ig tonight I mean BIG . Splinter chews on this .
APHAEL: Yes . Splinter is grim . Nods . But he moves on .
RAPHAEL: Thank you father . Mikey bursts in the door , frantic .
MICHAELANGELO: Dudes . I think you 're gon na want to check this out .
BEAT: Where 's Leo ?
DONATELLO: So , the first time that this portal was opened , the Stars of Kikin aligned ( sketches on high tech
SCREEN: and that 's why it occurred in that specific South American egion . Now if we take into account the continual rotation of the Earth since then , as well as the gradual celestial shift that 's happened and een recorded over well , ove the course of that mountain of ooks over there we now know ou new location .
APRIL: Precisely at 40.748 degrees latitude and -073.985 Degrees longitude .
DONATELLO: New York City .
APRIL: Winters Tower .
DONATELLO: And the alignment is due to occu in precisely- - well tonight . It sits in the room . Heavy .
MICHAELANGELO: But without Leo what do we do ?
RAPHAEL: We rescue our brother and save New York City . Splinter stands to his side .
CASEY: Wow .
APRIL: Picked it up on my last trip to Japan . You like it ?
CASEY: Oh oh yeah .
APRIL: Where 's your mask ?
CASEY: Mask ? What mask ?
APRIL: I was saving it for ou anniversary .
BEAT: Thanks .
APRIL: That 's our ride .
RAPHAEL: You know I ai n't much on speeches .
BEAT: But we can do this . Leo , or no Leo . Not because of our individual strengths but because of how we function as a team .
ICHAELANGELO: I love you man .
RAPHAEL: Do n't push it . April , this is going to be dangerous . You sure you 're in ?
APRIL: I feel responsible , fellas . I found the Generals for him .
KARAI: As ordered - no one gets in . No one interferes . No one bears witness .
KARAI: May I help you ?
CASEY: Yeah , hey , I was supposed to drop this off for Mr. Winters . If I do n't get this done , I am majorly in the doghouse . You know what I 'm sayin ' , right ? Right ?
KARAI: Please come in , then .
CASEY: Really ! ? I mean , `` but of course '' .
APHAEL: Let 's NEVER do this again . And who did that ? !
MICHAELANGELO: What ? ! Why does everyone always call ME out ? A long beat . Then
CASEY: I suppose this is where we all take out our sharp and pointy things ?
KARAI: You suppose correctly .
RAPHAEL: I am SO gon na enjoy this
APRIL: I had the situation under control .
SMIRKS: You 're welcome .
APRIL: Guys ! Front door is open . Now ! They all charge the front door !
MICHAELANGELO: What do we do , dudes ? !
DONATELLO: I 'm working on it .
RAPHAEL: We get ready for round two .
APRIL: Nice work , Jones .
CASEY: I have my moments
DONATELLO: Look !
BEAT: Cool . They all run over . Mikey runs to a cell .
MICHAELANGELO: Leo ! Is that you ?
DONATELLO: Out of the way , please .
RAPHAEL: Hey buddy ! Come on , man . Leo , please wake up !
CASEY: Is he is he dead ?
MICHAELANGELO: Yup . He 's WAY dead , dude .
RAPHAEL: No harm ? ! Whatever ! I 'm about to give you piercin 's in places you never imagined if you do n't tell us what 's going on .
APRIL: We know everything Max . We know you 're trying to recreate what Yaotl started 3000 years ago .
GENERAL AGUILA: He fails to discuss the petrified agony of three thousand years .
GENERAL SERPIENTE: Of the torture of taking CENTURIES to merely blink an eye !
GENERAL GATO: Of watching the erosion of your own ody throughout centuries .
GENERAL AGUILA: So , while our great leader basked in the warmth of the sun and the glory of fresh air we rotted in the stone hell that lasted throughout Wmillennia .
GENERAL GATO: And now , our Master has tired of feeding on the nectar of life . Of loving his entire life . Of FEELING . So he prefers to end it all . End HIS `` misery '' at the expense of ours .
GENERAL AGUILA: But thanks to his cunning , his technology , we are now capable of LIVING we have now become- - gods .
GENERAL SERPIENTE: And we shall finish what we began all those years ago . We will finally have our victory .
GENERAL GATO: Even with one monster still free , the curse can never be broken !
GENERAL AGUILA: Join us . Join us Yaotl , and live a life eternal with us at your side ! ON WINTERS - He waits . A beat .
BEAT: And you are weak .
GENERAL AGUILA: Destroy them .
APRIL: What does THAT mean ?
KARAI: It means we 're going to help you .
CASEY: I got shotgun !
RAPHAEL: If you mess with one of us- -you mess with all of us . Aguila smiles at their chutzpa .
GENERAL AGUILA: Challenge accepted .
CASEY: So anybody from out of town ?
LEONARDO: Come to daddy .
RAPHAEL: Sensei ! How you guys doing ? !
KARAI: My troops have located the final monster . At the harbor docks .
ASEY: Oh , I got this one covered .
ASEY: Huh . Now there 's somethin ' you do n't see every day They pile out of the van .
CASEY: Well , I guess we have to figure out how to get handsome here back to Winters ' Tower .
KARAI: We should tie it to the van and drag it back .
CASEY: Wow . You 're hard core .
LEONARDO: They better hurry with that last monster !
RAPHAEL: I 'm sure my man Casey 's got it all under control
LEONARDO: That 's what I 'm afraid of .
APRIL: What are you doing in here ? !
CASEY: Ran outta food .
APHAEL: Listen . I 'm the last guy to sound like a TV cartoon , but I think we need to work together .
MICHAELANGELO: Teamwork . The more you know Don clocks Mikey behind the head .
TEASING: Why Raph , no solo act tonight ?
RAPHAEL: So who wants ta call it a day ?
LEONARDO: I 'm in .
DONATELLO: Affirmative .
MICHAELANGELO: Roger dodger , dude .
GENERAL AGUILA: Silly children . We are immortals made of stone ! The Earth has only BEGUN to feel our wrath !
RAPHAEL: I thought he 'd never shut up .
CASEY: Oh . I , uh -
APRIL: Do n't try to tell me for one second that you did n't enjoy tha-
KARAI: You are every bit the warriors I was informed you were . You have passed .
LEONARDO: Passed what ?
RAPHAEL: You know us ?
KARAI: I 've known OF you for some time . Savor your victory tonight . Fo soon we will have further business together .
RAPHAEL: She does n't mean
ICHAELANGELO: I 'm never usually that happy to be leeding .
DONATELLO: You would be if you were an immortal who could n't bleed fo three thousand years Winters looks at all the Turtles .
MICHAELANGELO: So , um , what happens now ?
MICHAELANGELO: Okay just a little bit creepy .
SNEEZES: Oh gawd . I think he 's in my n-n-
APHAEL: You wanted to see me Sensei ?
RAPHAEL: Thank you , Master Splinter , fo your guidance . I can only hope that one day , I will be able to begin the next stage of my training like Leo .
BEAT: Our training works in mysterious ways . But the answer that lies in all our questions is family .
RAPHAEL: So we 're cool with the whole Nightwatcher thing ?
LEONARDO: Yeah , we 're cool . Our secret , bro . You got rid of the stuff , right ?
EONARDO: What about the bike , tho ?
RAPHAEL: Okay , so I could n't exactly destroy the bike .
BEAT: Let 's just say it 's in good hands .
LEONARDO: What do you mean ?
RAPHAEL: I mean , it 's in good hands .
LEONARDO: Oh , you did n't . Raph sheepishly shrugs as we-
APRIL: yes .
SUZIE: Remember , especially you men , that working together now will already have formed a bond before the child arrives . The woman is very sensitive . Somewhere in the room a Male Voice booms out .
GIDEON: Spoiling the little foxes that spoil my vines .
SUZIE: Everyone is gone . Rhonda is in the athroom .
GIDEON: I was looking through my trunk and I ca n't find my toby .
RHONDA: What 's that ?
GIDEON: It is a charm that my great grandmother made me .
SUZIE: It will show up .
RHONDA: If my daddy calls , tell him I walked home .
SUZIE: You be careful and thank you fo looking after Sunny .
GIDEON: Babe Brother and his wife are taking advantage of a situation . I hate to be mean to people but picking Sunny up when they feel like it has to come to an end . Now I 'm going to ask him how come he could n't be at your birthday .
SUZIE: Do n't bother the poor boy . It just takes some people a little longe to figure out who they are .
GIDEON: I do n't know how two brothers can e so different .
KIDS: Shut up ! Go help your mama wash dishes !
DAVIS: We have a complaint from one of your neighbors about a rooste crowing in the mornings .
SUZIE: The police are here to talk to you about the chickens .
GIDEON: What can I do for you , Officer ?
DAVIS: You know it is against the city ordinance to keep chickens or live stock .
GIDEON: I always had chickens , ducks and whatnots .
DAVIS: Not anymore , not in the city .
GIDEON: We grow most of our own food . The money I get from social security , my pension and my wife 's work , keeps us living on the edge . What choice do people like us have .
DAVIS: Well , you just have to move furthe out .
GIDEON: Now how far would further out be ?
DAVIS: I 'm not here to argue , sir .
SCOTT: You guys do n't make anything illegal , do you ?
GIDEON: Like what may I ask ?
SCOTT: You might have a distillery pumping out barrels of moonshine .
DAVIS: Look , just get rid of the chickens and you all have a nice day .
GIDEON: I 'll be damned if I get rid of my chickens . I ought to get some hogs and put them out there .
SUZIE: Who is it ?
BABE BROTHER: I was hoping you came to the doo instead of him . It gets cold at night .
SUZIE: This does n't make any sense ; you are going to drag that poor boy out in the cold air .
BABE BROTHER: He will be alright .
GIDEON: What time is it ? Do you think you can just treat us like your slave ? It 's after one .
BABE BROTHER: I tried to call to let you know I was going to be late .
GIDEON: That 's a lie .
SUZIE: Let us settle this tomorrow .
GIDEON: Look ! Do n't try to get ahead by iding our backs .
BABE BROTHER: I pay my own way .
GIDEON: Since when ?
SUZIE: Take Sunny home , please .
GIDEON: Your feet are cold .
SUZIE: Go back to sleep .
GIDEON: I asked you to wake me when Babe Brother comes .
SUZIE: You all act like two roosters .
GIDEON: I 'm not going to let him get away with murder .
SUZIE: You and Babe Brother are so much alike
GIDEON: He ai n't nothing like me . How come a man has to have sons that are day and night apart ? You ought to stop protecting him .
SUZIE: Hush .
GIDEON: You 're always taking his side .
SUZIE: Hush .
GIDEON: I 'm trying to make him a man but you keep babying him .
SUZIE: You 're going to find yourself on the floor .
BABE BROTHER: I want you to be the richest man in the world so I can be the richest father in the world .
SUNNY: I do n't want to be rich . I want to work on the railroad like grandfather .
BABE BROTHER: Son , if you are going to have a family , you ca n't always choose a job just because you like it . I do n't want you to shine anybody 's shoes or be a porter . You let somebody else carry your bags .
LINDA: NO .
BABE BROTHER: He would n't want any if you did n't try to keep it away from him .
LINDA: Because you were spoiled , do n't try to spoil Sunny .
BABE BROTHER: My daddy never gave me anything without my having to sweat for it . Every summer , the way they kept me and Junior out of trouble was to send us to Big Daddy 's farm . We would get up with the chickens . Every summer the fence had to be epaired . The barn needed a coat of paint . We had to pip all of Big Mama 's hundred laying hens and go to church all day on Sunday . Fo Big Daddy , calluses and sweat were the mark of a man . Sunny will neve have to bust his knuckles like we did .
LINDA: I want Sunny to have an advantage that you and I never had , but he needs discipline , and you are not helping when I tell him to do something and you allow him to get out of it .
BABE BROTHER: What is a sip of coffee going to do ?
LINDA: Coffee is bad for anybody , especially for a child .
BABE BROTHER: I do n't see you crying about my drinking it .
LINDA: How old are you ?
GIDEON: Instead of standing here doing nothing , I better give those chickens some scratch before they start cackling .
SUZIE: How are you ?
OLD JOHN: Tolerably well . I brought you some more rabbit manure for your roses .
SUZIE: It is so considerate of you . Gideon sticks his head over the fence .
GIDEON: Well , well , look who is taking up all the sunshine . Brother John , how are you doing ?
OLD JOHN: I 'm still here . Suzie leaves the two men talking .
GIDEON: Tell me something . How do you get energy to stay on the move all day ?
OLD JOHN: You could n't sit on your rump unde my daddy 's roof . No sir . If you could n't outwork his mule , you was n't worth the salt you put in greens . You had to wake up looking for something to do . I was raised as a mule and now I 'm a rolling stone .
SUZIE: I know you did n't but you have been so thoughtful .
OLD JOHN: But when your sunflowers come up , I 'll pay you for them .
SUZIE: I planted a row just for you and you do n't owe me anything .
MOTHER: It hurts .
SUZIE: Do n't push too fast ! Breathe ! The hard part is over . You can see the top of the head .
MOTHER: It hurts . The pain . It 's tearing me .
SUZIE: Father , give her a hand .
FATHER: Hey , this is too much .
SUZIE: You do your part .
MOTHER: Can you tell what it is ?
SUZIE: Almost there .
FATHER: It 's a junior .
MOTHER: Ah , I wanted a girl . Suddenly the baby begins to SCREAM .
JUNIOR: When are you going to find time to help me fix the roof ?
BABE BROTHER: You all do n't believe me when I tell you I 'm afraid of heights .
JUNIOR: You used that excuse to get out of the army .
BABE BROTHER: You always got something to say .
GIDEON: Your mother asked me not to mention it but your mother 's birthday was last week .
BABE BROTHER: I had n't forgotten . I ordered some cloth but it did n't come in and I felt so bad if I would have come to her birthday without that , I just stayed at home .
GIDEON: What did your wife get her ?
BABE BROTHER: We got the same thing . Junior laughs at Babe Brother 's story .
GIDEON: Boy , go tell your wife to come in .
BABE BROTHER: Why do n't you come in for a while ?
LINDA: I would like to finish reading this . What would I talk about ? I have n't read this month 's almanac . I do n't care to hear about how the corn was this fall or how to get id of gophers by putting garlic in their holes . They pride themselves in making life hard and that 's not my cup of tea .
SUZIE: You know , Babe Brother 's wife just dumps greens in the pot without washing them .
GIDEON: Babe Brother is a poor boy .
JUNIOR: You all should have been hard on him like you were me and he would n't be the way he is .
SUZIE: Everybody got the same . I breast fed him like I breast fed you .
PAT: Junior , you are wrong .
BABE BROTHER: Just for a minute .
SKIP: I did n't mean to hit your car . I was throwing at my birds .
GIDEON: I need about five pounds of laying mash and you better give me about the same of scratch .
CASHIER: You missed it . We had a two-day sale last week .
GIDEON: What kind of a sale is a two-day sale ? I thought sales last a week or two .
CASHIER: Every day we have something different . Today 's sale is hay . 25 % off . If you have a horse or cow , you 're in business .
GIDEON: All of the preachers were down in the basement of the church confessing their sins to one another . They were way down in the asement 'cause they figured no one would hear them . One of the preachers said , it makes me feel too shame to tell how bad I have een . You know them young gals that sit up in the first row . I can look at them and forget my text . I 'm just lost when it comes to women , even them middle age sisters . Then another preacher said , I do n't think I can tell you what my sin is 'cause it 's bad . Another preache said , Brother , we all amongst friends . Tell us what 's troubling your soul . Clear your conscience . Gideon takes a sip of water .
SUZIE: You ought n't tell him stories like that .
SUNNY: Tell me another story .
GIDEON: I 'll you a story about the terrapin and the rabbit . No , you tell me a story . Come on .
SUNNY: Once upon a time , my mommy and daddy lived in this big house that I bought for them . I got them this ig car .
SUZIE: You stay back . You might cut you fingers . Suzie looks down sadly at her broken tea pot .
GIDEON: I looked everywhere for my toby .
SUZIE: Harry , I ca n't believe it is you . Gideon , look who is here .
GIDEON: Harry , good God Almighty , man ! It 's een , what , thirty years or more . Suzie , we have n't seen Harry since we left home .
HARRY: He kind of favors one of my boys when he was about his age .
GIDEON: He knows better . Sunny , apologize to Harry .
SUNNY: I 'm sorry .
GIDEON: What are you doing in these parts ?
HARRY: I came all the way from Detroit by us going to Oakland . The bus stopped in Los Angeles . I had to get off and take a rest . I 'll catch the last bus leaving at midnight . I 'm just too tired to go on .
GIDEON: Why did n't you catch a plane ?
HARRY: My feet have never been on anything that was n't directly attached to the ground .
GIDEON: Stay until you feel better ? I would like to hear all the news .
HARRY: I 'm worn out but wo n't you feel like you are taking in a stranger ?
SUZIE: Stranger my foot , it was my grandmother who helped you into this world .
HARRY: Well , I do n't want to put you out .
GIDEON: Man , put your boxes down and stay as long as you like . We have empty ooms since the boys got their own families and moved out .
HARRY: Well if you 're sure , I wo n't be a other . Oh , I do n't sleep on no spring mattress . I always make myself a pallet on the floor .
SUZIE: Poor old Harry , he really must have een worn out . He has been asleep all day .
HARRY: Good evening . It must be all the different time zones I crossed that makes me feel this weary .
SUZIE: You should go back and rest .
HARRY: No , if I rest any longer , I wo n't sleep tonight . May I use you athroom to wash up a bit ?
GIDEON: Man , act like this is your home .
HARRY: That 's awful generous of you . I always ask to keep from wearing out welcome .
SUZIE: One can tell you are from back home . These people nowadays do n't know what manners are .
HARRY: Where we come from , you had to know how to act right . You had to know how to say yes sir and no sir . You had to know your place .
GIDEON: You had to tread softly .
SUZIE: Those days you could always find something redeeming about even the worst person .
HARRY: You remember that boy who lost his mind , Joe ? You could hear him pitching horseshoes at night in the dark . He would n't miss a one . Make him mad and call yourself running in the house to be safe . He would pick up a brick and say `` go on in there brick and hit somebody '' and it would find its mark .
SUZIE: I was afraid to go to Marcus Bottom ecause of him .
HARRY: All those places that us coloreds lived , that we used to call Bottoms , have all been changed to Drives and Heights . Everything is in what you call it , not in what it is .
GIDEON: Harry , I would like for you to meet my oldest son , his wife and daughter .
JUNIOR: Pleased to meet you . So you 're from ack home , too .
PAT: This boy must be turning over . Oh , he just kicked me again .
GIDEON: It 's the boy next door throwing at his birds . I 'm just waiting on him to hit a pane in the window
HARRY: I 'm going to wash up now . You all please excuse me .
GIDEON: You ought to come hear ou preacher . Remember old Cat Iron ? Well , our preacher is just as strong .
HARRY: Next time when I feel a little etter perhaps .
GIDEON: I was going to get up and get a hen out there for dinner , but time got away .
HARRY: Oh , I would feel much at home if you let me get one for you . I have n't wrung a chicken 's neck in a month of Sundays . You know , folks would call my daddy to kill thei hogs . That used to be my trade from time to time .
GIDEON: Well , I would appreciate that .
LINDA: You do n't act like the rest of Gideon 's friends . They believe if you are not hard at work , you are hard at sin .
HARRY: Oh , I 'm more modern in my ways . I do n't believe in sin , though there is good and evil . And evil is a thing you work at .
LINDA: I think he wants to see your rabbit foot .
HARRY: I let this rabbit foot do in place of my toby that I lost years ago .
LINDA: What 's a toby ?
HARRY: You do n't want to be at crossroads without one . It 's a charm that old people teach you how to make . I had one for a long time that belonged to my grandmother who had it eve since she was a child . In my travels I misplaced it . I have been looking over my shoulde ever since .
LINDA: I thought you were n't old fashioned .
HARRY: In some things . When we were children , there used to be an old man that came around and would snatch your soul if you did n't have something on you that did n't make a
LINDA: No . No . No . No . I had my Child at Cedars and Sinai . And that ai n't no county hospital . You have to have cash or check before you come in the door .
HARRY: Some folks take that natural stuff too far .
LINDA: Junior 's wife kept her afterbirth ' in the refrigerator . That 's why I do not eat over there now .
HARRY: Country people got so many strange ways ,
BABE BROTHER: Did you ever have to use this thing ?
HARRY: That is called a crab apple switch . It 's for those bad acting monkeys and just the thing for a mean dog . Now I do n't know if I actually did what I did or got my life and story mixed in with other folk 's stories ut I seem to recall that I had to use my crab apple on a boy from ack home . I was up in Memphis working on the railroad , like you daddy who had an easy job . He would sing a song that had a cadence and we would lay track . Anyway I was coming down Beale Street and I heard this music coming from a saloon . Sure enough it was Emory . My daddy taught both of us to play ut Emory was natural at it . Got in a blues band and what not . He and another boy had killed a boy named Hocker sometime back and they alled the Jack leaving town . Emory had lost one eye and had a sca unning down his face . Bad luck I would say . He got to drinking that corn liquor . We went to his girl 's oom and he would n't stop drinking . He started talking about the old days and he went mad . He pulled his knife and I got to mine first . The lights went out .
BABE BROTHER: Do n't pick up the cards if you are not in the game . Did he die ?
HARRY: I do n't know what happened to him . He just ran out into the streets . I got some old records I want you to hear . I like the blues sung simply , man and a guitar . Or sung y a woman who had bad luck all he life . Do n't ever let anyone tell you his life 's story if it is of a weary life full of sadness . When I was a boy , a man told me a story of how he lost all of his sons and I 'll be damned if the same thing did n't happen to me . Sunny is busy playing in the curtains .
LINDA: How was church ?
HARRY: How often is your wife called to help delivery ?
GIDEON: It was slow . Now it seems like everyone is having births at home .
HARRY: Everything these days is made overseas .
GIDEON: You and Babe Brother hit it off so well .
HARRY: Course , it is your business , but I feel obliged to tell you that maybe you have not been fair with the oy .
GIDEON: I tried to teach him right from wrong just like I did his Junior .
HARRY: Everyone has to follow his own plough . A man does n't have to know how to cut a wick and clean a chimney nowadays . City people do n't give a hoot and a holler about the shape of the moon nowadays . You do n't plant old ways but , at the end , you find yourself doing what your father did ut you have to have the land in you . It 's when you want to give the house or farm to the kids and they do n't want it . You sell it to a stranger . You worked your whole life , for what ? I doubt if people nowadays have knowledge of a victory garden o seen an inch worm . All what we 've experienced has no meaning .
GIDEON: You 're suppose to teach you children what you know . Junior , I do n't have to worry about . Babe Brother is a different story .
HARRY: You still call him boy . You call Babe Brother boy in front of his wife and son .
GIDEON: My daddy called me boy up to the time he died . I was always boy to him .
HARRY: 'Course , you could be right . You sons are alive . All my sons are dead .
LINDA: It has three bedrooms , one and a half baths . Well , yes , that means two toilets and one bath . Well Yes , by appointment Call me back if you decide . She hangs up the phone .
BABE BROTHER: Will you still get the money from your father ?
LINDA: I told him we might not need it , if you can talk your parents into giving you your share of the property .
BABE BROTHER: Pops put Big Daddy 's farm in Rhonda 's and Sunny 's name and fixed it so no one can borrow on it .
LINDA: We could borrow on that land and put the money to work .
BABE BROTHER: I preached to Mom and Dad about it ut they are stuck in their ways , it 's like talking to a brick . But if there is a way
JUNIOR: You want me to mortgage my house to invest in a scheme of yours ? You know the last time we went into something together Daddy had to go in his savings to keep us from ending on the street .
HARRY: I can sit here and look at train tracks all day . We laid enough of them , did n't we ? So many memories are stretched along tracks like these .
GIDEON: In weather like this , you can not walk around bare-headed . He wipes the sweat from his hat band .
HARRY: We 'll go a little farther . The walk will do us some good .
PAT: Did you do your homework ?
RHONDA: Yes . Mama ?
PAT: What ?
RHONDA: Can I name the baby ?
SUZIE: I have someone I want you to meet .
HARRY: I 'll be right there .
HATTIE: I could n't believe it when Suzie called and said you were staying here . How have you been ?
HARRY: Girl , do you still sing and dance ?
HATTIE: No , I 'm a different person now , Harry .
GIDEON: Have n't the years been good to Hattie ?
HARRY: It has n't been the years ; it 's been the men in her life .
HATTIE: Harry , that 's not nice . I 'm in church now .
HARRY: Why run out and close the barn doo when the horse is gone ? I remembe when you were n't saved . That was way back yonder when the Natchez Trace was just a dirt road .
HATTIE: Some people grow up and change their ways .
HARRY: I know your mother ai n't still operating that house of hers .
HATTIE: My mother passed on years ago .
GIDEON: Good God Almighty , if it ai n't like a parade of people from out of the past . M.C. , where did you come from ?
HATTIE: Harry , what did you do , rob the graveyard ?
SUZIE: I will have to look for it .
HATTIE: None of your business .
HARRY: That is a boy from home , Lulla 's other . Suzie is surprised .
SUZIE: Harry , you know everything .
HARRY: You got to know everything , do everything , and be everything .
HERMAN: M.C. , I 'm worn out . You ready to go ?
SUZIE: No , but I might have some Indian Chief Tonic .
HATTIE: I have n't heard anyone mention Swamp Root since button-up shoes went out .
HARRY: You can certainly tell how old you are , my dear . Hattie is angered .
HATTIE: You know the saying , `` your heart is in your left hand . ''
HARRY: Now I was trying to be nice , to make conversation , since we go back some .
HATTIE: I was quoting from the Bible . If the shoe fits , wear it .
HARRY: `` Out of weariness , I spoke to my own heart ; to leave it all and to die . And I gave my heart to know madness and folly . ''
HERMAN: You all ought to get along .
HATTIE: Harry , you know you remind me of so much that went wrong in my life . When I heard you were here , I made a special effort to come and see you . I see you are still a pile of wet chicken feathers .
HERMAN: Oh Lord .
HARRY: My sister , women can get away with so much . I do n't have any enemies 'cause I do n't live in the past . As Pushkin , you do n't know him , said , `` In the hope of glory and good , I look without fear ahead . ''
HATTIE: An empty wagon makes a lot of noise and you , tappy head , you ai n't worth the salt you put in greens .
HARRY: Speaking of tappy heads , we ought to have an old fashion fish fry .
HERMAN: I do n't have too many fish fries left .
HARRY: We can have it here next week .
HATTIE: Is this your house ?
HARRY: Oh . I 'm sorry . Gideon , what do you say ?
GIDEON: Well , it 's up to Suzie .
SUZIE: It would be nice .
HATTIE: In the meantime Harry can slaughte us a hog .
HARRY: I already have , my dear .
HERMAN: Please , M.C. , take me home .
WILSON: No one in my family ever been to a hospital to give birth . My siste has four children and all were born at home . My mother and her mother , it just goes on and on .
HARRY: A woman in family way just reminds of spring and my younger days .
PAT: That 's nice .
HARRY: Well , you and your husband are special . Ya , Gideon tells me you do volunteer work to help feed the poor .
PAT: Last Saturday we handed out ove two hundred meals .
HARRY: Good God Almighty , bless you ones . But the problem grows .
PAT: Week by week the crowds at the doo keeps getting larger . We ca n't feed all the hungry .
HARRY: Of course not . Have you ever heard of a man jumping in the river to save five hundred drowning people ? No you ai n't . You have to take just one and fatten him up . When you spread help too thin , you , you just nickel and dime the situation . If you try to save all , all die but if you save one life , life goes on . You just have to remember , medicine that works leaves a bitter taste .
PAT: I do n't know if we could take one in with Rhonda and me at home alone at times .
HARRY: Oh , I was n't pointing my finger at you . Hey , you have to think of yourself . A lot of them have all kinds of diseases and will cut you throat while you sleep . There are too many bad people out there .
JUNIOR: I appreciate you lending me a hand . That lazy ass brother of mine was suppose to help me .
HARRY: Well some folks are still waiting for their comeuppance . Do n't take me wrong but you ca n't judge people y how you act . You 're a caring person .
JUNIOR: He should be caring . That is not too much to ask .
HARRY: Ya , but you ca n't do the shuffle with one leg . You and your wife , in your spare time , work with the less fortunate . Now I 'm not talking about you and what you do but some folks that always run to help the victim , deep down are attracted to pain and suffering and love to be near the dying .
JUNIOR: All the people working with us are eally doing it 'cause they hate to see suffering .
HARRY: You never know what 's in the heart and just because you can cry does n't make you human .
JUNIOR: We ca n't really bring anothe family in here with us .
PAT: Why not ? Harry says that 's the only way to do good .
JUNIOR: When did you talk to Harry ?
PAT: Do n't shout !
GIDEON: I think we have enough . So now tell me a story .
SUZIE: Are you feeling well ?
LINDA: I 've never been so tired in my life . Where is Sunny ?
SUZIE: He is getting his things together . Babe Brother , you ought to take your wife home so she can get some est .
BABE BROTHER: In a minute .
HARRY: Take your wife and child home , boy .
SUZIE: Fred Jenkins .
JENKINS: Suzie , you have n't changed and you , Gideon , if you do n't look like John Henry . Oh , this is my wife , Esme . My first wife Lulie died .
BABE BROTHER: What is that ?
HARRY: Boy , that is the real South . That is real corn liquor . A crowd starts to gather around .
FLIM: What is in the bottle ?
HERMAN: There is a fight in every bottle .
GIDEON: You tappy heads better not tea down my house .
HATTIE: Look , you better get out of my face efore I slap the living daylights out of you . Harry stops the music .
HARRY: You folks excuse me but you know we have a celebrity from out of the past , our own nightingale . If you had any good times in your life , you remember Hattie . She use to keep those juke joints steaming . If Ma Rainey and Bessie Smith were the stars , she was the sun . Let 's get Hattie to sing something from the old days .
HATTIE: Harry always tries to be the king fish . I told him I 'm a new person . I 'm saved .
MARSH: Harry , you will not remember me but we go back quite a ways . I 'm glad Hattie told me that you will be here 'cause there is a matter that has been troubling me all these years that maybe you can help me clear it up .
HARRY: Man , I ca n't talk to you now . I 'm filling in the gaps with these folks .
YOUNGER WOMAN: How do you manage to keep in step and move around so like one of them young boys ?
OLDER MAN: Get yourself a pace-maker like me .
PAT: These old folks can dance bette than I can . Get rid of that long face . Get one of these old farts to show you how to do the Black Bottom .
OKRA: Do n't be so stand-offish .
HARRY: Son , you have n't danced with you wife all night .
MARSH: There is something that I always wanted to know . Tell me , how did those boys die ?
HARRY: Now who are we talking about ?
MARSH: Miss Clara 's boy , Emory , to start with . The Johnson 's Hocker was another one
HARRY: Was n't Hocker lynched ?
MARSH: You know as well as I do that it was made to look like he was lynched . Now who would hang someone from a persimmon tree ?
HARRY: What difference does it make if it 's persimmon , oak tree o huckleberry bush ?
GIDEON: Tell me , how come me and Suzie have to be mother and father to you child ? You never take the boy to the park , circus or anything . If we did not take him to church , he would n't have any sense of eligion .
LINDA: I think forcing him to go to church when he really does n't understand is not saving his soul . When he gets old enough to make up his own mind about religion , that will be etter . It will be his intellectual decision .
GIDEON: Is that the way your parents raised you ?
BABE BROTHER: Why , you do n't want us to bring him over ?
GIDEON: No , it 's that when do you have time to be parents to him ? You guys do n't pick him up until nine , ten at night . You are into yourselves , as the saying goes . Spend some time trying to be parents . Take him to the mountains , fishing . You ought to let him get to know nature .
BABE BROTHER: Well , you are his grandfather . He is supposed to spend some time with you . You 're supposed to show him those woodsy things and this and that .
GIDEON: Junior spends time with his child .
BABE BROTHER: Oh here we go with that .
WILLIAM: Hurry up and take this picture .
FRED: If it was n't for the NRA , colored people would have been the lost tribe .
FLIM: Remember what they use to call the NRA ? Negro Raggedy-ass Army .
MARSH: Hocker 's death almost caused a race iot . A lot of innocent people could have been hurt behind that .
HARRY: Strange as it may seem , it might have cleared the waters . Sometimes the right action comes from the wrong reason .
SUZIE: Do you want your coat ? It 's cold out here .
GIDEON: No , I 'm too hot now .
SUZIE: You better be careful . You 'll get a stroke arguing .
GIDEON: I would n't care if I drop dead if he learn something from it . Son , you make me wish I was dead .
SUZIE: Gideon , do n't say things like that .
BABE BROTHER: Why does he always pick on me ?
LINDA: He is just being like all parents , concerned about the ones they love .
BABE BROTHER: I do n't need that kind of love . And I do n't want to be reminded all the time that Big Mama 's grandmothe was born in slavery . If you really care about me , just tell me how I can make money .
SUZIE: Babe Brother , I 'm going to take my hand and hit you across your mouth .
LINDA: He does n't mean what he says .
GIDEON: Let us go back in before the night of celebration becomes a night of me killing my son .
SUZIE: No . Before anyone moves , you two shake hands and do n't carry it any further .
HATTIE: Do n't make me say something nasty now .
HARRY: I think if anybody had a hand in killing Hocker , you ought to ask o you should have asked Emory and Chick .
MARSH: Chick was outright killed by a mob . He killed a white man that owed him some money and when they caught up with him , they tied him behind a car and dragged him from out of the hills back to town .
HARRY: Those boys never did have good luck .
MARSH: You damn right they did n't , especially Emory , my cousin .
HARRY: Emory had made a lot of enemies . He had a big mouth .
SUZIE: She has a fish bone caught in he throat . Could all of you go in the other room ? Gideon , get some bread and toast it quickly and find me the cod liver oil .
LINDA: Are you going to work or sleep all day ?
GIDEON: I 'm worn out .
SUZIE: Just stay in bed and rest .
GIDEON: I have to feed the chickens before they wake everybody up .
SUZIE: You stay inside . I will see to them .
GIDEON: I will appreciate that .
HARRY: How is everybody ?
SUZIE: Tolerable well .
JUNIOR: How did you sleep last night ?
HARRY: Ah , you young folks do n't know how it is . How is Gideon today ?
SUZIE: He was n't able to get out of bed today .
HARRY: I hope that it 's nothing serious .
SUZIE: He has never gotten rid of the malaria . He is usually up and at it the next day . I 'm going to make him fresh chicken broth .
HARRY: Let me earn my keep . I 'll go out and get a hen and have it picked and ready for the pot . Try to make him some cow tea next time .
SUZIE: Can you watch Gideon for a while ? One of the girls is going into labor . Junior is going to drive me over .
HARRY: You just run along . I 'll fix him his soup . He will be all right .
SUZIE: Oh my Lord !
OKRA: You think old Gideon is going to live to see this month out ?
HARRY: When I came upon the valley of ones , the serpent said , `` Make this your home . Dry as my soul be , heaven is lost to thee . '' We all got to make way .
OKRA: Herman , you will have to catch the next one 'cause I 'm out of breath .
HERMAN: If I have to chase after one , we wo n't eat .
GIDEON: I do n't want to stay here . Where is Babe Brother ?
HARRY: Never play with someone 's else 's cards . You always get a new deck . Look at this card . See anything ?
BABE BROTHER: It is just a regular card .
HARRY: Son , I can take everything you got with that deck . It is marked . Now I 'm going to show you how to make some money in case you get stuck somewhere .
BABE BROTHER: Does n't he look a whole of lot etter ?
SUZIE: Well , you look better than you did yesterday .
GIDEON: Next time , I do n't care how sick I 'll be , do n't take me back to the Veteran 's Hospital .
HARRY: Boy , I thought you were about to cross the river .
GIDEON: I tell you , I feel like a ghost .
HARRY: Son , would you do me a favor and see if you could turn off that tap in the bathroom . My hand is too weak . And would you do me anothe favor ? I do n't like asking this but would you clean the tub for me ? I have trouble bending over .
BABE BROTHER: Anytime you need someone to do something for you , just let me know .
HARRY: That smells like fresh coffee .
SUZIE: Let me get you a cup ?
HARRY: Only if you can spare it .
BABE BROTHER: What in the hell
GIDEON: It 's good to be able to hear that .
SUZIE: You must have been really sick .
GIDEON: How is the garden doing ?
SUZIE: I need to get out there and get those weeds out .
GIDEON: How is that hen doing ? I was meaning to pip her before I fell sick . He takes a deep breath and blows it out .
PAT: He just leeches off your parents . He is a master at wearing out welcome .
JUNIOR: Harry is the kind of guy you would love to take out in the woods and leave under a rock .
PAT: Where does her get the power to summon all his old raffish friends ? They all smell of moth balls .
HARRY: How old is that boy ? Babe Brother looks at Sunny 's shoe .
BABE BROTHER: Linda , how come you do n't see that Sunny puts his shoes on right ?
LINDA: Why in the h
HARRY: Let 's give Dry Bones a call to see if he is coming or not . Okra likes to exaggerate , keep you waiting all night .
LINDA: Why do n't you wait ?
BABE BROTHER: You okay ?
LINDA: I 'm okay . Go back to your friends .
PREACHER: Sister , we 've come to see how you were doing . We came to ask if we could pray over Gideon .
SUZIE: I put some Plummer Christian Leaves under his feet to draw the feve out .
PREACHER: What else have you been giving him ?
SUZIE: I crossed his stomach with cold oil and gave him some cow tea .
PREACHER: Suzie , I would think you would depend on prayer rather than these old fashion remedies . Let us read from the Bible .
LADY: Something pleasant .
SUZIE: I do n't know where that music is coming from .
SUNNY: I want my daddy .
JUNIOR: Boy , hush that noise and get in this house . Make haste .
SUNNY: I want my daddy ; I told you .
JUNIOR: Rhonda , drag him in here . If you be nice , I will take you to Disneyland . Pat , Linda and Junior put the suitcases down .
PAT: Now you do n't have to say anything if you do n't want to .
JUNIOR: I want to hear what happened . My other is a jackass and a damn fool . The both of you have been as scarce as hen 's teeth . Linda looks down , embarrassed .
PAT: Rhonda , take Sunny in the backyard . Take a bowl so you can pick some strawberries . Sunny will enjoy it .
JUNIOR: Whether the boy hears it or not , the man is still a jackass . Everyone should have some mothe wit .
LINDA: Something just took control of him . He stays out all night and comes home with a pocket full of money .
PAT: It 's probably Harry , but I hate to mention his name , because every time we say something about him something bad happens .
HARRY: Let us walk awhile . I grow weary when I sit still too long .
BABE BROTHER: I could swear I heard my son call me .
HARRY: You probably heard the wind stirring up those dead leaves ove there .
BABE BROTHER: I heard his voice as clear as day . I better get back . Maybe something is wrong .
LINDA: I told Babe Brother that if Harry sets foot in our house again , I 'm taking Sunny and leaving . Just as I said that , here come Harry and his old resurrected friends , hobbling up the steps .
JUNIOR: Is that how you got that black eye ?
PAT: Do n't ask that .
LINDA: No , this was an accident .
JUNIOR: Sure .
LINDA: It was unintentional .
JUNIOR: Babe Brother reminds me of the story of the man who wanted to be sizable . He wanted to be tall but what he was really short on was ains . There was a time when people had moon fever were treated with leeches .
LINDA: What do you want ? No . Nothing happened to him .
MR. BAKER: What are you doing ?
MRS. BAKER: Counting the gray hairs in you head .
MR. BAKER: Counting the what ? What does that have to do with the price of utter ?
MRS. BAKER: I was just trying to make conversation .
MR. BAKER: Where is Skip ?
MRS. BAKER: He is in his pigeon cage .
MR. BAKER: I 'm sorry he got those birds .
MRS. BAKER: You know the man next door is nea death .
MR. BAKER: Do n't blow that thing in here . You low that thing when I 'm at work .
JUNIOR: Why does n't he just park his ca and come in and apologize ?
PAT: Stop it Junior !
RHONDA: Mama , come see what Sunny did .
HARRY: How is he doing ?
SUZIE: As long as he keeps his throat clear , he is able to get some rest .
HARRY: I made a fresh pot of coffee . Okra and I thought you need a rest . I 'll stand guard . Okra wants to talk to you anyway . Harry helps Suzie to her feet .
OKRA: I brought you these greens and some salt meat .
SUZIE: That is very thoughtful of you . I have n't had time to tend to my garden like I should .
OKRA: You know Gideon and I are lodge others and it has always been a policy to take care of the wives if something happens to our brother .
SUZIE: You are very sweet , but Gideon has already taken care of everything in case something happens to him . He has a policy .
OKRA: If you become a widow , you will need someone around to fix the whatnots . We like for the widow to marry someone in the lodge . I know Gideon ai n't gone yet , but there will be a lot of his old friends coming around to get in line . I just want you to consider this as a kind of a conditional proposal , to e first in line so to speak .
SUZIE: Excuse me . I have to go feed my dog .
HATTIE: You know Harry lied about how that oy Hocker got kilt . And it was Harry who saw Emory last before they found him hanging over a levee like someone would hang a hog .
SUZIE: I remember Harry always trying to help someone . He got Lulla 's daughter out of trouble . He was always running to the store fo someone who could n't leave the house .
HATTIE: Harry always shows his good side and , like the moon , the other side is black . Back home he always did try to act like the colored gentleman . I 'm telling you Harry is nothing but evil . I 'm warning you you ca n't keep a wild animal as a pet around children .
SUZIE: You know Okra asked me to marry him the other evening .
HATTIE: Rush your mouth , girl . No , he did n't . He can not be that big of a damn fool .
SUZIE: I asked Harry about it . He did n't own up to it . He said he did n't know what got into Okra .
HATTIE: He 's just raffish . Harry put him up to it . Before evening sun sets , I would have his belongings back on Route 55 , that old fox .
SUZIE: I ca n't accuse him just dry long
HATTIE: Everybody who have been associated with Harry end up with pennies ove their eyes .
SUZIE: What must I do ?
HATTIE: If it was left up to me , I would poison him .
HARRY: Good afternoon , ladies .
SUZIE: Good afternoon to you .
HATTIE: I 'm going to check on Gideon .
HARRY: As God is my witness , I have neve done anything to that woman .
SUZIE: You must have done something to her .
HARRY: Since she has repented , all she does is throw stones .
SUZIE: Hattie is a different person now .
HARRY: I do n't make no bones about where I 'm going to spend eternity . I have always been wild and you know that . If you are made to feel half a man , what do you think the other half is ?
SUZIE: I 'm glad you brought that up as to who you are . I have to know who is in my house .
HARRY: You invited me .
SUZIE: Only if you are a good man , a friend . Are you a friend ?
HARRY: Like that boy next door playing that his horn . If he was a friend , he would stop irritating people , ut if he stops practicing , he would n't be perfect in what he does someday .
SUZIE: I want you to leave .
HARRY: Okra , M.C . and Herman want to go ack home with me . Suzie , I 'm not a bad fellow ; I just like to have a good time . M.C . is coming by to pick me up tonight . I 'll come back to get my things . Well , I hope Gideon ecovers . You know I have an extra picture of one of my sons that I would like for you to put with those baby pictures over you dresser . It 's better than being in my dusty wallet with addresses and names of people who are no longe on this earth .
OKRA: Why did you buy so much toilet paper ?
HARRY: Whose old piece of knife is this ?
HERMAN: That was my brother 's knife .
HARRY: I do n't want to wear out welcome , ut you can stay in someone 's heart longer than you can stay in thei house . Come with us , boy . We are going to have a good time .
BABE BROTHER: This would be a bad time for me to leave .
HARRY: We are going where the action is . Ai n't that right , Okra ? Let 's play for a couple of bucks unless you want to start off with two bits and work our way up . What would you give to be rich ?
BABE BROTHER: Had Moms and Pops given me my share of what was mine , I could have been ich by now . Linda and I had it all worked out . Harry wins the first hand .
HARRY: I know your mind is on your wife ut you should never treat a woman as an equal . You want to get you wife back , get another woman , one of those big hip women that will ide you till you sweat .
HERMAN: In the ground there is a hole and green grass growing around the hole . Now in the hole there is tree and green grass growing all around the tree . Now there is a hole in the ground , a tree in the hole and green grass growing around the hole .
HARRY: Let me share something with you . Harry stops and thinks for a while .
OKRA: These damn things are unloaded , ai n't they ?
HARRY: It 's important to know the difference between the incoming fire and the outgoing fire . As Amos and Andy might say , `` We is the outgoing fire . '' Come with us , son . We 'll show you some steaming hot juke joints , steaming hot women .
BABE BROTHER: Let me go by the house first .
HARRY: We will wait for you as long as we can . I got to get my things from your mother 's house .
BABE BROTHER: I need to get my suitcase out of the garage .
SUZIE: What for ?
BABE BROTHER: I 'm going back home with Harry .
SUZIE: I 've heard some foolish things in my life .
BABE BROTHER: Harry is coming to pick me up .
SUZIE: Have you lost your mind ? Have you thought about your wife and child , not to mention your sick father ? And I need your help to move his ed from under the leak in the ceiling .
BABE BROTHER: I 'm busy .
SUZIE: Do n't make me raise my hand to you . You have to see for yourself that you are going in the wrong direction .
BABE BROTHER: Ca n't I be myself without you jumping in with your right and wrong ? The world is not black and white . Show me one perfect person . If you ca n't , do n't ask me to be .
SUZIE: I do have a right to ask you to be a little bit better than me and your father because we gave you a etter head start . You have no ight to complain to us about you not having enough . You sit right there with your no manners self .
JUNIOR: Where is Babe Brother ?
SUZIE: Brother is in the kitchen .
JUNIOR: How come you did n't ask Babe Brother to help you ?
SUZIE: He said he was busy . He is mad 'cause he wanted to get in the garage to get his things so he could go with Harry . Linda has a surprised look on her face .
JUNIOR: So he is busy ?
BABE BROTHER: I told her I would if she would give me time .
JUNIOR: I bet you if your master would have told you to fix the hole in the oof , you would have rebuilt the whole damn house .
BABE BROTHER: You always got the best of it around here and when Dad always talks about my son , it is always you , so you fix the roof .
JUNIOR: That is a damn lie and you know it . Every time father asks you to do something , you either half-ass do it or run off and hide . Mama asked you to turn the dirt in her garden and you told her , with your smart ass self , that you were n't a farmer ; get Junior to do it . Every time someone asks you to do something , you always say , tell Junior to do it . Boy , you ought to grow up .
BABE BROTHER: I told you about calling me boy . I ai n't no boy . See , you and Dad got a bad habit of calling me boy . You call me boy in front of my wife . You think I 'm going to fix the oof ? I hope the wind blows the whole damn thing off and it pours down rain .
JUNIOR: I ought to break your damn neck .
BABE BROTHER: I 'm leaving and do n't even call me when the shoe falls 'cause all he did for me was to try and run my life . I 'm tired of people saying Babe Brother this , Babe Brothe that . What 's my name ?
JUNIOR: You dumb ass , it 's Babe Brother .
BABE BROTHER: My name is Sam . Samuel .
JUNIOR: Sit down !
PAT: Stop it ! Stop it ! Look what you are doing !
JUNIOR: Someone get some lard out of the ice box .
LINDA: You are going to need some stitches . We better take her to the emergency hospital .
BABE BROTHER: I 'll drive her to the hospital .
JUNIOR: We will take her . You all stay here and watch Dad .
LINDA: What about Pat ?
PAT: I 'm okay now .
NURSE: What sort of emergency are you here for ?
SUZIE: I cut my hand .
NURSE: Let me take a look at it .
JUNIOR: Yes .
NURSE: The bleeding has stopped but it will need stitches . You will have to fill out this form . How will this be covered , insurance , cash o check ?
JUNIOR: Do n't worry about it . It will be paid . Just let her see a doctor .
SUZIE: I have Medicare .
NURSE: Do you need to see the doctor too ?
BABE BROTHER: No , just my mother .
JUNIOR: Why is it so crowded ?
NURSE: Well , it is Friday night and a full moon .
GIDEON: Suzie , I 'm hungry .
HARRY: I ca n't believe what I heard took place .
SUZIE: How is Gideon doing ?
RHONDA: He is asleep now , but he was up all night eating .
HARRY: I came to pick up my things .
LINDA: You ought to go see how your fathe is doing and then wash that blood off you and change shirts .
SUZIE: Gideon . Gideon 's only response is to SNORE louder .
PAT: How long is Harry going to hang around ?
WHITE PARAMEDIC: There is nothing we can do for him .
JUNIOR: Well , are n't you going to take him with you ?
ASIAN PARAMEDIC: If he had died in our care , we would be required to take him . Since we found him dead , you will have to wait for the county to pick him up .
JUNIOR: How long will that take ?
WHITE PARAMEDIC: That would depend on how busy it is . I 'm sorry .
MARSH: What happened ?
JUNIOR: He slipped on some marbles that were on the floor . Then his heart gave out .
LINDA: I told you to always put those marbles up and not to leave them just anywhere .
PAT: The poor thing is not to blame . Rhonda , take Sunny for a walk . Marsh hands Rhonda several dollars .
MARSH: Here , go around to the store and uy what you want .
HATTIE: Would anybody object if I take a look at him ?
HERMAN: I do n't think Harry would like it .
HATTIE: I never noticed how big his eyes were .
BABE BROTHER: Mister Mister Excuse me fo cutting you off but we pay taxes too . We should not have to pay you to take a 24-hour lunch break . Babe Brother hands the phone to Linda .
LINDA: He does n't know when he will be out this way again . Somebody downtown is going to hear about this .
PAT: I got white meat and I got dark meat . I know it sounds cruel but we have to eat .
GIDEON: What , are you having another party ?
SUZIE: You better come sit down . You are still sick .
GIDEON: Gal , you 're talking to John Henry . When was I sick ?
JUNIOR: You have been out for almost three weeks .
PREACHER: We had long conversations with the Lord about you . Did n't we , Siste Suzie ? I said we need him down here , Lord .
OKRA: That 's our friend Harry .
GIDEON: Not our Harry ?
OKRA: I wish it was n't . Gideon seems to weaken for a moment .
GIDEON: What happened to him ?
HATTIE: He dropped dead .
HERMAN: Hattie , you can be so mean .
GIDEON: How long has he been dead ?
SUZIE: Since this morning .
GIDEON: What happened to your hand ?
SUZIE: I cut it on an old rusty knife . Gideon is deeply concerned .
GIDEON: What did you put on it ?
SUZIE: It 's healing now .
GIDEON: I hope you will take care of you mother better than that when I 'm gone .
BABE BROTHER: Yes .
GIDEON: How come you 're not wearing my shoes ?
BABE BROTHER: They 're too big .
GIDEON: When is the undertaker coming ?
LINDA: They ca n't say . I 'll try calling them again .
HATTIE: Why do n't M.C . and you drag him to your house ? Herman moves away with a look of disdain .
MARSH: Harry did n't have any relatives living , did he ?
PAT: Why do n't you look through his things to see if you can find a number ?
LINDA: How do you like that ? They hung up in my face . I 'll fix them . I 'll show them just how mean I can get .
MARSH: These are letters to his son .
HATTIE: I still do n't know if I was right about Harry .
BABE BROTHER: I have more sense than to give up everything , my family , you and Sunny . It was n't me , I mean the eal me inside my body . I 'm glad it 's over . It 's like a veil has een lifted .
LINDA: Like a veil has been lifted ?
BABE BROTHER: It 's like I 've been swimming in muddy waters .
LINDA: Like muddy waters ?
BABE BROTHER: It was like all those things old country people try to tell you what hell is like .
LINDA: You were in hell ?
BABE BROTHER: I could n't believe the things I was doing . It was like an internal struggle going on inside my body .
LINDA: Do you think you won ?
BABE BROTHER: It was nip and tuck .
LINDA: And what lesson have we learned from all of this , Babe Br Sam I mean Samuel ?
BABE BROTHER: I guess it proves you really care about me . You hung in there .
GIDEON: When are you boys going to fix that oof ?
BABE BROTHER: Soon as I rest a bit . I meant as soon as we are back to normal again , anytime .
GIDEON: Here I am thinking about myself when poor Harry is resting on the floor of the kitchen .
SUZIE: It feels like a storm has passed Hattie read some of Harry 's letters to a woman he had a child by . The child had died and he was writing to give her some comfort . Hattie did n't know that deep down at the ottom of Harry 's hate , there was some love .
GIDEON: Did I ever tell you the story about the man who wanted to make his own mind up about heaven and hell ? He did n't want nobody 's opinion but his own .
SUZIE: I do n't want to hear any joke about colored people being in hell . You 're being irreverent .
GIDEON: I 'm almost finished . I 'm about to come to the punch line .
SUZIE: I do n't want to hear any tales about colored people
GIDEON: But these are white people , anybody . The punch
SUZIE: I do n't care to hear any jokes about people being in hell . This cut on my hand reminds me that it is nothing to laugh at .
GIDEON: It 's only a tale .
M.C: Is that an earthquake ?
HERMAN: It 's something .
BABE BROTHER: I 'm cold . I need to get out into the sunlight .
JUNIOR: What is it , noontime ?
PREACHER: I wonder how they going to bury this man .
HATTIE: Plant him in Potter 's Field . He does n't need a marked grave .
HERMAN: Hattie , your true colors are unbearable . You got some mean ways . Do n't worry about the boy getting a urial . He still has some friends left on this earth .
HATTIE: His winter has come and gone and I know right now he is answering fo a lot of things . M.C. , Okra and Herman move away from Hattie .
PREACHER: It is my job to pray for his soul and I would like to do that .
MAN: Hey boy , you still got that dead man in your house .
VIRGINIA: I know you all have n't had a chance to cook or do anything with that dead man in your kitchen . You must e starved to death . Some of you neighbors have got together and we set up a picnic table in my ackyard with food and everything to feed all you all .
SUZIE: Virginia , that is so wonderful of you all !
MARSH: If the dead wagon comes , we ought to leave a note telling them we 'll e down the street at a picnic .
PAT: I think we better be ready .
V.O. NARRATION: `` The economic explosion following the Civil War created an unprecedented nation-wide market for beef . Previously worthless cattle running wild throughout Texas were gathered into herds And driven north to the railheads In Kansas . Fortunes were made as Cowtowns sprang up on the Prairies , wide-open centers of Commerce and vice , their streets Choked with heavily-armed young Men fresh from the cattle drives . In those days the correct term For a cowhand was 'drover ' . 'Cowboy ' , like 'cowpoke ' , was originally an insult implying deviant sexuality and was rarely used . But these invading drovers were a wild breed for soon shootings and wholesale drunken iots became so frequent that ordinary citizens literally could not walk down the street . In fact at their height the cowtowns had higher murder rates than modern New York or Los Angeles and there Was no law but that of the gun . ''

BOND: What 's Harmsway done ?
MINISTER JOHNSTONE: A rumor - from an anonymous source -
MINISTER JOHNSTONE: Hearsay . Idle chatter from a source you ca n't identify - who insists on talking only to 007 . Nothing but loose talk and innuendo .
MINISTER JOHNSTONE: More scurrilous , unsubstantiated gossip .
BOND: Perhaps . But it does explain how an ex-KGB agent turned illegal-arms dealer is suddenly portrayed as a long-time friend of the people . If you believe what you read in the papers .
MINISTER JOHNSTONE: Need I remind the two of you that Elliot Harmsway - Sir Elliot Harmsway - is directly descended from the Earl of Aberdeen ? That his Scottish ancestors practically invented Hong Kong - and out of sheer gratitude , Queen Victoria herself named the port `` Aberdeen Harbor '' in their honor ?
BOND: Of course .

BOND: Saunders , I 've lit cigarettes -
SAUNDERS: Not from forty feet .
BOND: Shoelaces ?
SAUNDERS: Plastique explosive shoelaces . Cut them to regulate the size of the last ; totally harmless until you attach the detonator hidden in the heel of your shoe .
BOND: Perfect way to tie up a 'Knotty ' problem ?
SAUNDERS: Moving along - A typical plastic security card . Name here , magnetic information stripe here - And a code breaking microprocesso here . Swipe it through any card eader - anywhere - you 're in .

BOND: I see
SAUNDERS: Finally , your new watch Blue lase here for signaling or burning through locks ; press this button , the sweep hand becomes a Geiger counter .

PARIS: Stop it ! You 're hurting me ! Ca n't you just be nice ?
BOND: I 've got half the British government eathing down my neck . I do n't have time for your nonsense . She 's surprised - and hurt - by his coldness .
PARIS: Do n't you even miss me ? Did n't I mean anything to you ?

BOND: Paris -
PARIS: Leave me alone ! He 's going to kill me ! !
BOND: Why did n't you tell me ? Why was n't it in our files ?
PARIS: He did n't want anyone to know . He kept it out of the papers . He said a third wife was bad for his image . You 've got to protect me !
BOND: Go to my hotel room . I 'll be there in twenty minutes .
PARIS: Just - say it . Say it just once .
BOND: One thing at a time . I 'll see you in twenty minutes . Go .

NUMBER FIVE: Consider him slimed , sir .
HARMSWAY: Splendid . Next Number Three . Your report ? A SHORT MIDDLE-EASTERN MAN stands . Nervous .
NUMBER THREE: I regret to inform you , sir , that Saddam Hussein is still demanding a onus for his role in the Gulf War .
NUMBER THREE: Yes , sir . But he still feels his people should share in the increased profits of our news division . He has proposed an additional 500 million dollar payment .
HARMSWAY: And there 's no truth that 10 % of that money will go into your Swiss ank account ?
NUMBER THREE: No sir ! I swear ! This is not true ! !
HARMSWAY: You disappoint me , Number Three .
NUMBER THREE: Please sir . Please -
HARMSWAY: But because I am a just man , I 've decided to give Mr. Hussein what he deserves .
NUMBER THREE: Thank you sir ! Thank you ! Harmsway nods , watching him leave
HARMSWAY: Good-bye , Mr. Azziz .
STAMPER: Gum ?
NUMBER THREE: Thank you ! Thank you so much . You must thank Sir Elliot for me .
STAMPER: Here . Something to read on the plane .
NAVIGATION OFFICER: This does n't make sense . What 's our heading now ?
HELMSMAN: Zero one three . Due north .
FIRST OFFICER: Ca n't see a damn thing in this fog . Rating What have we got ?
RATING: A passenger ferry and two freighters oadcasting on low-band -
COMMUNICATIONS: And two small fishing boats about 30k north . No radar , but we 've identified their engine signatures . As the First Officer takes this in
FIRST OFFICER: What 's wrong ?
HELMSMAN: About every ninety seconds , the auto- pilot jogs us to the west .
FIRST OFFICER: Not in the Strait . How 's our position ?
NAVIGATING OFFICER: According to the satellite , we 're exactly on course .
FIRST OFFICER: Did you check the auto-pilot ?
HELMSMAN: The back-up does the same thing .
FIRST OFFICER: Check it again . What about the global positioning satellite ? Could there be something wrong with the signal ?
GPS OFFICER: Two words Im-possible .
FIRST OFFICER: How is it now ?
HELMSMAN: Seems to be back to normal , sir .
SONAR OPERATOR: I have something off the port bow !
FIRST OFFICER: A dead head . Water logged timber . Floats straight up . You sometimes see them on the east side of the channel - from the logging camps on Sumatra - but they do n't usually float this far west . Muncy ! Engines to half !
HELMSMAN: Aye-aye sir . Engines to half .
FIRST OFFICER: Chew up a log like that in the propeller , you end up with enough paperwork to go from here to London . Twice .
COMMUNICATIONS OFFICER: I 'm getting an electrical emission , sir ! Extremely close . Bearing 240 -
FIRST OFFICER: Punch up the radar -
RADAR OPERATOR: I 've got it , sir . A large craft - XX , OOO tons . Range - 200 yards ? It 's anchored in a cove !
FIRST OFFICER: That 's impossible ! We 're in the middle of the channel !
JUNIOR OFFICER: Breakers off the port bow ! We 're heading for shore !
SONAR OFFICER: Sir -
FIRST OFFICER: Full stop ! ! ! Call the captain !
SONAR OFFICER: Sir !
FIRST OFFICER: What ? ! ? !
SONAR OPERATOR: The log is moving !
SENIOR OPERATOR: We 've been hit ! We 're taking water !
DAMAGE CONTROL: Flooding in the engine room !
FIRST OFFICER: Get me damage reports ! Start the pumps !
SECOND OFFICER: It 's the Captain -
THE CAPTAIN: What the hell is going on ? ! ?
FIRST OFFICER: I think we 've been holed , sir !
THE CAPTAIN: On my way !
HELMSMAN: The engines are gone !
DAMAGE CONTROL: Flooding on D deck !
FIRST OFFICER: Sound the general alarm ! Seal all compartments ! As the Second Officer grabs the intercom - SECOND OFFICER Attention all hands -
SYSTEMS OFFICER: We 've lost power !
FIRST OFFICER: Go to back up generators ! SECOND OFFICER Repeat Seal all compartments , and -

FIRST OFFICER: Where the hell are those generators ?
SYSTEMS ENGINEER: Coming up , sir !
FIRST OFFICER: Get those pumps working !
SYSTEMS CONTROL: The back-up is gone !
DAMAGE OFFICER: Flooding up to B-Deck !
HELMSMAN: We ca n't hold out much longer , sir !

SONAR OPERATOR: Six . That 's it ? Only six of us ?
COOK: Most of the crew never made it to their life jackets . The Captain ?
SONAR OFFICER: The First officer stayed on the bridge .
CREWMAN: Hey - look ! Over there !
HARMSWAY: Lovely night for a shipwreck , is n't it ?
STAMPER: We 've decoded their last transmission . Harmsway studies it for a moment - smiles .
YUNG: You heard him . Get the men in the water !
WOMAN: I ca n't believe it took us so long to finally get together ! What exactly do you do for the government ?
BOND: You might say 'Public relations . '
WOMAN: How fascinating ! I bet you meet all the most fabulous people .
MAITRE D': Excuse me - Mr . Bond ? You have a call . Bond excuses himself .
BOND: Moneypenny ! You 're early . You were n't supposed to call until - Yes . I understand . Twenty minutes .
MINISTER JOHNSTONE: Good evening . I 've just spoken with the Prime Minister at the economic summit in Tokyo ; he 's expecting a full update within the hour . For those of you still unaware , some forty minutes ago -
ADMIRAL ROEBUCK: Excuse me , but - I must formally protest this meeting . Given the nature of what 's occurred - and the need for secrecy - I see no eason to involve the air force , the army , or MI-6 . This is an internal affair that should e handled strictly by the officers of her Majesty 's Royal Navy .
MINISTER JOHNSTONE: Admiral , are you suggesting -
BOND: Sorry I 'm late -
ADMIRAL ROEBUCK: Yes . Of course .
BOND: I 've looked forward to meeting you .
MINISTER JOHNSTONE: As I was saying Approximately forty- five minutes ago , we received an abandon ship signal from the H.M.S . Indomitable . Looking at these infrared satellite images - provided by Mr. Tanner of MI-6 -the ship is presumed lost here , just south of Kuala Lumpur , where she oadcast her last position .
STAMPER: Divers approaching the hull . Harmsway and Yung look over his shoulder at
DIVER: It 's titanium . we ca n't cut through .
STAMPER: I 'll do it . HARMSWAY Divers , stand aside .
HARMSWAY: Gentlemen I do believe we 've struck gold Four minutes ahead of schedule .
MINISTER JOHNSTONE: One-third of the British gold reserves ? ! ? What kind of idiot loses - What is it ? The equivalent of ten illion US dollars ? ? ?
TREASURY OFFICIAL: Give or take . Depending on today 's currency rates -
MINISTER JOHNSTONE: What the hell was the gold doing on that boat ?
ADMIRAL ROEBUCK: We were bringing it back from Hong Kong . Under orders from the Treasury .
TREASURY OFFICIAL: During the cold war , we stored a third in America , and another third in Hong Kong - in case of a nuclea attack . And with the turn-over of Hong Kong to the Chinese -
MINISTER JOHNSTONE: Why was n't the ship protected ? ! ? ! Why was it sailing without radar ?
ADMIRAL ROEBUCK: I resent your tone , sir . I have men who are missing -
MINISTER JOHNSTONE: And I have the entire British economy to worry about .
BOND: Minister - Obviously , MI-6 was not involved in this operation . But I have to defend the Admiral .
MINISTER JOHNSTONE: At least we know where the gold is . When are the recovery ships due ?
ADMIRAL ROEBUCK: 36 hours . They 've already sailed from the Persian gulf .
MINISTER JOHNSTONE: I expect to have that gold recovered in 36 hours . Until then , I 'm imposing my own electronic silence For the sake of the economy , not a word to NATO , the press , the CIA . And so long as Commander Bond here seems to be such an expert on these matters , I want him to go along as an observer . Are we agreed ?
ROEBUCK: Yes .
BOND: Yes .
HARMSWAY: Remember the golden rule , Mr. Stamper He who has the gold , rules . He drops the gold back in the hold .
STAMPER: Fueled and waiting .
HARMSWAY: Good . We have an appointment in Hong Kong .
BOND: I have an excellent teacher . 'Make sure you wear the uniform ' ?
BOND: It does n't quite add up .
BOND: A three-thousand ton frigate does n't just vanish into thin air .
BOND: Did n't Elliot Harmsway just move his headquarters to Kuala Lumpur ? She turns , freezes Bond with a look
GENERAL LI: And that is the fifth document . With your counter-signature , the sale will e complete .
HARMSWAY: General Li My young associate here has just informed me that if I waited a year , I could perhaps receive a higher price for this building . He has great faith in Hong Kong . As did my ancestors . With obvious results .
GENERAL LI: Most eloquently put , Sir Elliot .
HARMSWAY: Thank you , General Li . Now I 'll just sign this last document -
GENERAL LI: Sir Elliot ! Red ink -
HARMSWAY: Of course ! How foolish . More bad luck . I 'll just borrow yours -
CREWMAN 1: Sounding Bottom is thirty fathoms .
CREWMAN 2: Nothing . Negative bounce .
BOND: We should be right over it . They hear a SHARP DINGING SOUND -
OPERATOR 2: Wait - I 'm getting something .
BOND: Where ? What is it ?
OPERATOR 2: Not sure yet -
BOND: Let 's make another pass .
HARMSWAY: Morning , morning all . What have we got ?
EXECUTIVE SECRETARY: The Canadian Prime Minister wants to set a lunch -
HARMSWAY: Pencil it in for the next trip -
EXECUTIVE SECRETARY: The American presidential candidate called to complain about that sex story -
HARMSWAY: Send him a $ 10,000 campaign contribution , and explain I have no control ove what my journalists write -
EXECUTIVE SECRETARY: Your bankers want an answer about the Brazilian TV stations
HARMSWAY: No -
EXECUTIVE SECRETARY: The Queen invited you to dinner -
HARMSWAY: Yes -
EXECUTIVE SECRETARY: And the 9 30 news meeting is waiting .
HARMSWAY: Excellent .
BOND: Still nothing ?
WADE: I am not here , ol ' buddy . The CIA has absolutely no knowledge of the missing ship , the missing gold , where it was going , or when it left Hong Kong .
BOND: That 's reassuring .
WADE: Hey - the world is my office .
BOND: Let 's take a look at the body .
WADE: Smells like Coffee plants .
BOND: I do n't think so . The veins are cauterized - as if they were sealed y heat But there are no burn marks on the flesh . It does n't make sense . Who found the body ?
POLICE OFFICER: Dato . Local fisherman . Says it came in with the tide early this morning .
BOND: Ask him if it could have washed in from the west side of the Strait .
POLICEMAN: No . He says it 's not possible . The current could have only brought the ody in from the east .
BOND: You have a boat ?
WADE: I do n't know if you 'd call it a boat
BOND: Something with an engine ? Not oars ?
WADE: Step into my office .
BOND: Tide and current charts . Work ackward from the body - find where the ship sank . Where did you get the boat ?
WADE: Seized it from a guy smuggling computer chips out of Bangkok . Should have seen his rose garden Blooms the size of hand grenades .
BOND: Over there .
WADE: I think I 've just seen my next future ex-wife .
BOND: Not if you kill us first - unless that 's how you plan to leave Muffy . Wade scowls , setting the boat back on course .
WADE: By the way , Jimbo - whatever happened to that girl - in Cuba - ?
BOND: Natalya ?
WADE: Yeah . Russian Minister of Transportation .
BOND: She married a hockey player .
WADE: I envy your 'undercover ' assignments .
BOND: We work in the dark . We do what we can .
HARBOR MASTER: Wind , tide , currents You 're the second person today asked for a full set of charts . If you 'd just sign here - Bond takes the clipboard -
BOND: Thanks . By the way - was there anything strange the night before last ? Odd weather , lost boats - ? ?
HARBOR MASTER: No Unless you 're talking about the bus problem .
BOND: Bus problem ?
HARBOR MASTER: Captain Cheong 's ferry was late . He uns the line across the Strait etween here and Sumatra . The lumbe mill workers coming back for the weekend missed the last bus . Slept on the docks . Hundreds of them .
BOND: Thanks .
WADE: Spends his nights at the Kuala Lumpu yacht club .
BOND: Can you arrange a meeting ?
WADE: Hell . The CIA built that club .
CAPTAIN CHEONG: In the Strait of Malacca , when a boat is even five minutes late , one begins to worry , Mr . Bond .
BOND: I know . Pirates from Sumatra want the cargo ; smugglers from Thailand and Burma want the ships .
CAPTAIN CHEONG: Sometimes kill the crew ; other times - Torture them .
BOND: I 'm sorry .
CAPTAIN CHEONG: The Kuala Lumpur ferry was 35 miles off-course that night . Captain blamed the auto-pilot ; I suspected he was drunk - until the Sumatra ferry captain had same problem .
BOND: Did you test the auto-pilots ? The satellite positioning receiver ?
CAPTAIN CHEONG: Next morning . Both boats . Nothing wrong . My 90 year old grandfather thinks 'Ghost in the computer - Silicon Dragon . '
BOND: I appreciate your time -
CAPTAIN CHEONG: Maybe you should talk to Sidney Winch . Owns a marine salvage company . Nobody knows more about the Strait .
BOND: Where can I find him ?
CAPTAIN CHEONG: Him ? He , is a she - at the bar .
SIDNEY: Bourbon . Neat .
BOND: I wonder if you handle your liquo more carefully than you handle your boat .
SIDNEY: Sometimes , you just have to plunge into things . Be reckless .
BOND: - And I bet you always leave turmoil in your wake .
SIDNEY: Have we met ?
BOND: This afternoon . Our boats practically kissed in the harbor . James Bond .
SIDNEY: Sidney Winch . The BARTENDER APPEARS .
BOND: Vodka martini , shaken not stirred . And another for you ?
SIDNEY: No . But you can buy a drink for my friend , Taro .
BOND: Boyfriend ?
SIDNEY: Chaperone . I 'm waiting for my dinner date .
BOND: Pity . Bring him whatever he wants .
SIDNEY: So what brings you to Kuala Lumpur , Mr . Bond ? Wait - do n't tell me Unhappy marriage ? Running from some poor little girl with two kids and a Chanel pocketbook in - London ?
BOND: Actually , I 'm here on business . You might say it was a Golden opportunity .
SIDNEY: And exactly what business are you in , Mr . Bond ?
BOND: Insurance . Lloyds of London .
SIDNEY: The Strait can be a very dangerous place , Mr . Bond . A few words scribbled on a piece of paper in London does n't carry a lot of value out here . Including life insurance .
BOND: I 'll keep that in mind .
SIDNEY: I see my date is here . And I think Mr . Bond is ready to leave .
BOND: Nice to run into you again .
SIDNEY: Let 's not make it a habit .
TARO: I think you should go -
BOND: Not quite yet , Taro -
SIDNEY: Uncle Elliot ! !
TARO: I said you should -
WADE: Yo ! Jimbo ! I won five hundred - What happened ?
BOND: He tied one on .
GIRL ONE: Good morning !
GIRL TWO: Good morning .
GIRL THREE: He 's arrived .
Q'S VOICE: You 're late 007 . I 've been expecting you .
BOND: Q ! How are you ?
BOND: I 'm sorry . It was a national emergency -
BOND: Do you have any idea of what any of that means ? In English ?
BOND: Do I have to dial ' 9 ' to get out ?
BOND: - Four wheel drive ?
BOND: 17 Beverage cup holders ?
BOND: I must say , Q , you seem to be doing ather well in your retirement .
BOND: Slow down . We 're close . Wade pulls back on the throttle .
WADE: I dunno , Jimbo . It ca n't be out here . How could they get this fa off course ?
BOND: Who knows ? Fog , night
WADE: They 'd never sail this close to the shore .
BOND: Wait a minute - I 've got it . There ! Off the port bow !
WADE: Two-fifty 's pretty deep for air . You should really be using mixed gases . Bond glances at the air gauge on his tanks .
BOND: I 'll make a bounce dive . If I can keep my bottom time short , I 'll be all right .
WADE: I got you covered .
BOND: That 's reassuring .
TARO: Uzi beats knife .
BOND: Interesting point .
TARO: Get him up . Take his belt . Take the two of them to the Captain .
WADE: Smell that Jimmy ? Sea Kelp . Bond gives Wade a look .
BOND: Somehow , that 's not reassuring .
TARO: Here they are , Captain .
SIDNEY: Just give me one goad reason - Miste Bond , from Lloyds of London - why I should n't kill both of you , burn you oat , and use your bodies for shark bait .
WADE: So you two know each other ! ? ! Small world , ai n't it ? What happened ? Commitment problems ?
SIDNEY: Who is he ?
BOND: Sidney Winch , meet -
WADE: Jack Wade . Citibank . Commercial loan division . If you 're ever lookin ' for a sweet refinance on the boat -
SIDNEY: - Shut up !
BOND: You have to excuse Miss Winch She thinks she 's on a 'seduce and destroy ' mission through life But she wo n't kill us .
SIDNEY: No ?
BOND: No . First , because I do n't think it 's in your nature . And second , ecause there 's no gold down there .
SIDNEY: So charming ! So suave ! Do n't insult me . I 'm not one of you 'little London girls ' who falls fo the lies .
WADE: So it was commitment !
SIDNEY: Every wharf-rat from here to Hong Kong knows what 's on that boat and I 'm claiming it . One-third of that gold is mine .
BOND: That 's fine , but - even a little London girl knows that one third of nothing is still nothing .
SIDNEY: Was he carrying anything ?
BOND: I hope so .
SIDNEY: Think about mom . BOND WINCES . She 's goosed him .
BOND: Unusual technique .
SIDNEY: And what do you call this ?
BOND: - The family jewels ?
SIDNEY: What is this ?
TECHNICIAN: I do n't know . I 'm not sure - Just then , a CREWMAN BURSTS IN
CREWMAN: Boss ! We got company - comin ' up off the starboard bow !
SIDNEY: Bring them .
CAPTAIN MORTON: Attention sea barge Lay down you weapons , and prepare to be boarded .
BOND: If I were you -
SIDNEY: - You 're not .
BOND: Just remember They think there 's ten illion dollars in gold down there .
SIDNEY: Thank you . `` Now hear this Drop dead . ''
BOND: Gatling gun beats Uzi .
CAPTAIN MORTON: Who 's in charge here ?
SIDNEY: I am . What do you want ?
CAPTAIN MORTON: You have precisely one minute to pull up your anchor and be under way .
SIDNEY: Forget it . No way . I got here first .
CAPTAIN MORTON: Who 's Wade ?
WADE: That would be me -
CAPTAIN MORTON: Thanks for your message . And you 're Bond ?
BOND: Yes -
CAPTAIN MORTON: Guard ! Arrest these men ! Escort them to the cutter !
BOND: Wait a minute -
CAPTAIN MORTON: Get them out of here . If he says one word , shoot him .
SIDNEY: What 's your name ?
CAPTAIN MORTON: Captain Morton .
SIDNEY: My name is Sidney Winch , and -
CAPTAIN MORTON: Good for you , Miss Winch . You now have exactly 30 seconds to get this ust bucket out of here .
SIDNEY: I know my rights . These are international waters . The British Navy abandoned that boat , and I 'm claiming it . Under international law , I have the right to salvage what 's on that wreck .
CAPTAIN MORTON: Fifteen seconds . Perhaps you should consider hiring an attorney .
SIDNEY: I was an attorney !
CAPTAIN MORTON: Hmmm . I suppose this is a step above that profession . Ten seconds . Are you leaving ?
SIDNEY: No .
CAPTAIN MORTON: You leave me no alternative .
SIDNEY: You wo n't get away with this !
CAPTAIN MORTON: Good-day , Miss Winch . I advise you to get some steam up - before you run aground .
SIDNEY: You bastards ! Believe me - you have n't heard the last of me !
CAPTAIN MORTON: It 's no trick , Mr. Wade . I 've got half a mind to throw both of you in the brig .
BOND: Do n't you think you 're overreacting ?
CAPTAIN MORTON: Yes . The famous James Bond . I 've heard all about you , sir . You were unde direct orders to act as an observer - and yet you had to go off , on your own , like some half-assed CIA cowboy - Endangering the gold , attracting that lunatic woman , and then putting in a distress call for us to save you loody hide .
BOND: That 's all well and good , Captain , save for one thing There 's no gold down there .
CAPTAIN MORTON: What are you talking about ? We went through all this and the ship is n't even down there ?
BOND: Yes , the ship is down there . But the gold is gone .
CAPTAIN MORTON: That 's absurd ! It took two squads of forty men fifteen days to load that gold .
BOND: I know what I saw -
CAPTAIN: I do n't care what you think you saw . You 're a damned amateur . Just get off my ship . Go back to your trench-coats and your code names - and leave the job to professionals .
BOND: Aye-aye , Captain .
WADE: Where to now , Jimbo ?
BOND: I 'm not certain But I think there 's someone I want to press fo some answers in Kuala Lumpur .
HARMSWAY'S VOICE: Hello , Mister Bond .
BOND: Who is this ?
HARMSWAY: Elliot Harmsway ! I heard you were in K.L . and thought we might get together for a chat
BOND: How did you get this number ?
HARMSWAY: Oh , please , Mr . Bond . We live in the information age ! Information is currency - and with the right currency , you can have any piece of information . Besides I own the phone company . What do you say ? Twenty minutes ?
BOND: I 'm on my way .
HARMSWAY: Let 's find out exactly what he knows .
BOND: James Bond to see Elliot Harmsway .
PR WOMAN: Yes . I 'm to bring you right up . The valet will take your car -
BOND: I 'd prefer to park it myself . Temperamental . Practically has a mind of its own .
PR WOMAN: Do n't they all ?
HARMSWAY: Mr . Bond ! Nice to see you .
BOND: Sir Elliot .
HARMSWAY: Come . Let 's get out of the noise . - I 'll give you a tour of the uilding , then we 'll talk .
BOND: Yes A man with ink in his veins , and blood on his hands .
HARMSWAY: We print 31 newspapers here ; anothe two-hundred-and-seventy at satellite plants around the world .
BOND: And how many of those newspapers carried Paris Harmsway 's obituary ?
HARMSWAY: All of them , Mister Bond After you ?
BOND: I see .
HARMSWAY: I tried to save her . But she remained a manic depressive Fits , inappropriate ehavior Delusions of grandeur .
BOND: I wonder if it runs in the family .
HARMSWAY: The only difference between a psychopath and a genius , Mr . Bond , is the degree of success .
BOND: I can feel your pain . The doors open
HARMSWAY: By the way - what is it that brings you to Kuala Lumpur , Mister Bond ?
BOND: Sightseeing .
HARMSWAY: I call this the Rogue 's gallery .
BOND: Yes . I can see You 've hung the est of your relatives .
HARMSWAY: My third great Uncle - the Earl of Aberdeen - negotiated the purchase of Hong Kong from the Chinese . His son-in-law - George Harmsway - made the first family fortune , unning opium into Shanghai His son , Thomas , who lost it , smoking the opium And my grandfather Henry , who opened the first telegraph station , and published the colony 's first English newspaper . It was a city of unlimited possibility .
BOND: So why did you leave ?
HARMSWAY: Because it 's a dying city . Since the Chinese take-over , who knows what can happen tomorrow ? In any case , this is my father , Charles A oyal bastard who started the first radio and television stations . Said I 'd neve amount to anything , but I turned it into this He pushes through a door , into
BOND: And still not a thing to watch .
HARMSWAY: They 're merely tools to disseminate information .
BOND: Or disinformation If you wanted to , say , beam down a signal to send a ship off course ? Maybe one degree a minute ?
HARMSWAY: Fantastic idea Mr . Bond ! Perhaps I should buy it for a book ! It 's totally preposterous , but - You amuse me . And now perhaps I can amuse you . He stops at a VIDEO TERMINAL . Begins to type .
BOND: Words to live by ?
HARMSWAY: Your choice . Look at the time ! Come . There 's someone I want you meet - about a story I 'm thinking of publishing .
SIDNEY: That 's okay , Uncle Ell -
HARMSWAY: I see you two have met .
BOND: Briefly .
HARMSWAY: Do n't pout , Sidney . I invited him here hoping he might shed some light on your story . He 's from 'Lloyd 's of London . ' Are n't you , Mr . Bond ?
SIDNEY: He 's not going to tell the truth ! He was diving for the gold !
HARMSWAY: It seems - Mr . Bond - that Miss Winch has told me the most incredible story A sunken British warship filled with gold ; a British cutter firing on her ; billions of dollars in bullion lying on the ottom of the Strait . Bond is n't enjoying this charade .
SIDNEY: - I told you ! He was there ! -
HARMSWAY: - But as I 've explained to Sidney , without proof , there 's just no story . Do n't you agree Mr . Bond ? Before Bond can answer -
SIDNEY: But I have proof ! You ran out of here so fast , I did n't get to show you .
HARMSWAY: And what 's that , my dear ?
BOND: Sidney , perhaps we should leave this to -
SIDNEY: He brought that up from the wreck .
HARMSWAY: I see .
BOND: Sidney , I would n't -
SIDNEY: And what about this ? Any idea what this is ?
HARMSWAY: I believe it 's a depleted uranium drill bit , my dear .
BOND: Why do n't we just take these -
SIDNEY: No . I want Sir Elliot to keep them . Harmsway stands , comes around the desk
HARMSWAY: Well ! I do believe this requires further investigation !
SIDNEY: Thank you , Uncle Elliot .
HARMSWAY: No matter what the British government says , I wo n't kill this story . Miss Oxford will show both of you to the elevator And one of my people will definitely be in touch soone than later .
BOND: I 'm sure they will .
HARMSWAY: Good-bye , Mister Bond .
EXECUTIVE SECRETARY: Thank you both for coming in
BOND: Do you have a gun ?
SIDNEY: What ?
BOND: You heard me . A gun ? I left mine in the car .
SIDNEY: That 's funny you struck me as the kind of man who always carries protection .
BOND: Listen to me ! I 'm a British secret service agent . And we have about two minutes before Harmsway kills both of us .
SIDNEY: Has anyone ever suggested that you 're a paranoid psychotic ?
BOND: Harmsway sank that ship and stole the gold . It 's on the Sea Dolphin II . And thanks to your little show and tell - - giving him the evidence - We 're the only ones who can tie him to the crime .
SIDNEY: Elliot Harmsway is my Uncle !
BOND: Blood or Dutch ?
SIDNEY: He was my father 's best friend !
BOND: He 's killed closer .
SIDNEY: You are seriously deranged .
BOND: Maybe . But why are we going up instead of down ?
SIDNEY: Not if my life depended on it .
STAMPER: Does he have a gun ?
SIDNEY: No . On Stamper 's reply -
STAMPER: Good -
SIDNEY: This is a mistake !
STAMPER: Shut up !
BOND: Need a lift ?
STAMPER: Help me up .
BOND: I 'd try the stairs . As Bond and Sidney scamper off -
STAMPER: The stairs ! Attention all units ! They 're on the 71st floor !
HARMSWAY: Stamper ! They 're not to leave this uilding alive !
SIDNEY: This has got to be a mistake .
BOND: The only mistake is that they did n't kill us in the elevator .
SIDNEY: No . I 'm going with you .
HARMSWAY: Where are they ?
GUARD #1: I do n't see them - There !
GUARD: Roger ! Over and -
BOND: Out .
SIDNEY: JAMES !
BOND: Come here . You shoot . I 'll cook .
SIDNEY: My father left me the business .
BOND: Not a lot of difference .
SIDNEY: What do you mean ? Bond reaches forward to toss the coffee can -
BOND: Either way , you 're taking the goods from dead hulks .
SIDNEY: What the hell does that do ?
BOND: Cleans dirt . Let 's go .
STAMPER: It 's a trick ! After him . They 're in the south stairwell !
HARMSWAY: Get more men up there !
SIDNEY: Down ?
BOND: Up .
SIDNEY: Down ?
BOND: Up .
HARMSWAY: And so much for that . They 're on the 72nd floor set-back . Nowhere to go .
SIDNEY: Now what ?
BOND: That should buy us some time .
GUARD: I 'll call for a battering ram -
STAMPER: No . Get the fire ax .
BOND: We 'll go down close to the sky bridge . We may be able to swing over and use it for cover .
SIDNEY: No way . I sail . I do not fly .
BOND: Sometimes , you just have to take the plunge .
SIDNEY: All I know is one thing If we get out of here alive , that gold is mine . I 've earned it .
BOND: One thing at a time .
SIDNEY: What now ? And do n't give me some movie cliché like 'trust me . '
BOND: Trust me .
SIDNEY: We 're going to bounce off that thing !
BOND: Hold on !
STAMPER: They 're on the bridge . Seal off the 50th floor !
HARMSWAY: I should have hired this man . Get somebody up there !
SIDNEY: What about the elevators ?
BOND: We tried that already . Remember ?
SIDNEY: You know , this is as much your fault as it is mine .
BOND: Sidney , we do n't have time for this -
SIDNEY: Sure ! Just when I want to talk - Not that I would have believed you -
BOND: Put your back to the railing . Sit up on it .
SIDNEY: Are you listening to me ?
BOND: Put your arms around my neck . Lock your legs around my waist .
SIDNEY: We have time for that ?
BOND: Sometimes you just have to -
SIDNEY: Do n't say it .
BOND: It 's a lousy job , but - The only reason I stay is for the health benefits . Bond PULLS THEM OVER TO THE BALCONY .
STAMPER: They 're heading for the press room . Stop them !
BOND: He was bad news .
HARMSWAY: Why , I did , of course . It 's on the Sea Dolphin II , twenty miles outside of Hong Kong Not that it will do either of you any good to know . Now both of you Stand up . And toss the gun out , Mr . Bond .
SIDNEY: Uncle Elliot How could you do this to me ? Bond sneaks his hand in his pocket .
HARMSWAY: Oh , please , Sidney . There 's a hundred billion dollars at stake . Besides , I never really liked you father that much . He cheated at cards .
BOND: Are your guards really going to kill a helpless girl ?
HARMSWAY: My guards are from South Africa , Mr . Bond . This is their chance to get even with the formerly 'Great ' Britain . Now both of you . Put your hands on your heads , and step forward .
BOND: What did you do , Harmsway ? Make some deal with the Chinese government fo the gold ? .. Was the radioactive uranium I found in Venice part of it ?
HARMSWAY: Questions , questions , Mr . Bond Which I 'm afraid I 've neither the time , nor the inclination to answer . Take them out to the jungle and -
BOND: I forgot to mention The job comes with a car . 007 begins shooting , as -
HARMSWAY: Kill it ! Shoot the damn thing -
BOND: Here . You shoot . I 'll drive .
SIDNEY: You know , that 's another reason you 're probably not in a successful elationship .
BOND: Another reason ? ? ? Did I miss something ? ? ?
SIDNEY: You insist on calling all the shots . And by the way I am not a helpless girl .
BOND: Aim that way . Sidney starts to shoot as -
HARMSWAY: Seal the garage ! Cut the power ! He 's got no headlamps !
SIDNEY: We 're not going to make it !
BOND: If it 's radio controlled , it 'll break the code .
SIDNEY: If not ?
BOND: We blast through .
HARMSWAY: - Built to withstand a nuclear blast . Are they alive ?
STAMPER: Yes . Shall we kill them ?
HARMSWAY: No . I have a better idea . In fact , Mr . Bond may have actually improved my original plan . Bring them both to Hong Kong . And Make sure he has nothing else up his sleeve .
CHIN: Totally secure . Without codes , you 'd need a missile to blast through the front door ; you normally ca n't even get this close without a full security clearance .
YUNG: Now !
HARMSWAY: Get the machine in the water !
YUNG: A generator blew . Nothing to worry about . But I need one last shot of you . Why do n't you stand by the alarm ?
STAMPER: Put on your clothes . Cuff him .
YUNG: I 'm sorry to interrupt again . But we need one more picture for the story .
BOND: Sleep well ?
SIDNEY: Next time , I do the driving . Bond gives her a look .
YUNG: The drill is in the water ; approaching the intake tunnel .
HARMSWAY: Excellent . Harmsway looks up , hearing
BOND: I see you 're in your natural element , Harmsway A room filled with lethal power With a toxic core at its center .
HARMSWAY: Do come in Mr . Bond , Sidney You 're just in time for a nuclea meltdown !
SIDNEY: You bastard -
HARMSWAY: Please , Sidney . I 'd like to remembe you fondly .
YUNG: Approaching the first gate .
HARMSWAY: Start the grinders .
BOND: So that 's what the weapons grade uranium was for .
HARMSWAY: Precisely , Mr . Bond . In a matter of minutes , the boring device will arrive at the core of the reactor And when the radioactive blades cut into the plutonium -
BOND: - Instant melt-down .
HARMSWAY: Chernobyl will look like a campfire .
YUNG: We 're through the first gate . Approaching the second -
BOND: Why , Harmsway ? Was n't stealing the gold enough ?
HARMSWAY: Bore through . They used to say living well was the best revenge , Mr . Bond . They 're wrong . Revenge is the best revenge .
YUNG: Entering the main tunnel - ten minutes to target -
BOND: What could you possibly have to be vengeful for , Harmsway ? Still trying to prove yourself to daddy ?
HARMSWAY: Hong Kong , Mr . Bond !
YUNG: You have to leave -
HARMSWAY: A hundred and fifty years ago , my ancestors took this island - a arren , lifeless rock - and turned it into the greatest city known to modern civilization . And now that I 'm being forced to give it back , I intend to return it in exactly the same condition A arren , lifeless rock . The gold is merely reparations - payment from the spineless British government who would n't listen .
BOND: I think Uncle Elliot is having his own melt-down .
YUNG: Approaching the third gate -
HARMSWAY: Smash through it ! Laugh all you 'd like , Mr . Bond - but you fit perfectly in to my plans . Here . This just in . Newsflash . Read all about it .
BOND: Hong Kong destroyed by nuclea meltdown British agent found in eactor suspected of sabotage ; Harmsway calls for British government to resign . Harmsway smiles at Bond
HARMSWAY: As the advertising says Tomorrow never lies .
BOND: What about the gold ?
YUNG: You must go . Now . Otherwise the oat wo n't be out of range -
HARMSWAY: Thirty seconds . That 's the most brilliant part of the plan , Mr . Bond To save the economy , I 'll let the new British government - my British government - announce that the gold was irradiated in Hong Kong - where no one will be able to touch it for a hundred years . And just by coincidence
BOND: You 'll never get away with it , Harmsway . Too many people know . Bond tenses , ready to spring -
HARMSWAY: Who , Mr . Bond ? The kooks - the crazies - the conspiracy theorists ? The Oliver Stones of the world ? I 'll publish their books , I 'll make their movies , I 'll put them on my TV shows ! They 're my bellboys . They carry my luggage .
BOND: One problem , Harmsway The girl . And the handcuffs . They 'll give it away .
SIDNEY: No . I want to stay with him .
HARMSWAY: How sweet .
SIDNEY: My timing always was lousy .
BOND: I 'd rather die alone .
HARMSWAY: Take the girl . Leave the handcuffs . We 'll drown her at sea .
SIDNEY: Enjoy the rest of your life .
HARMSWAY: I 'll meet you on the boat , south of Lantau Island .
YUNG: Take the men . I can finish alone .
HARMSWAY: You come with me - You stay here . As they exit -
YUNG: We 'll cut through the last gate , then set it on auto-pilot . He starts to maneuver the joystick , and -
HARMSWAY: Any news ?
THE CAPTAIN: The call just went out on the Hong Kong police radio Fire at the powe plant .
HARMSWAY: Alert the media !
STAMPER: What do you want me to do with her ?
SIDNEY: - Ca n't we make a deal ? I wo n't say anything -
HARMSWAY: You 're so cute , my dear . But I 'm afraid not . Put her in the storage room .
CAMERAMAN: Do n't get any ideas . Then locks the door on her .
STAMPER: There it is .
THE CAPTAIN: I 'll tell Sir Elliot .
HARMSWAY: Yes ?
CAPTAIN'S VOICE: He 's approaching from the north , sir .
CREWMAN: Fantastic . Invite the crew on deck to celebrate , and I 'll be up in a few minutes .
STAMPER: Get the guns ! It 's not him ! It 's Bond ! ! !
HARMSWAY: What the hell is going on ?
THE CAPTAIN: I do n't know sir -
HARMSWAY: What the hell is going on ?
STAMPER: You 're mine now .
HARMSWAY: Stamper ! Report in !
HARMSWAY'S VOICE: Report to the bridge !
BOND: I never believe what I read in the newspapers . Harmsway slowly brings up the gun .
HARMSWAY: Pity you 'll miss your obituary .
BOND: Where is she , Harmsway ?
HARMSWAY: You want to kill me , Bond ? Go ahead .
BOND: Where is she Harmsway ? -
HARMSWAY: What is it , Bond ? You have n't the guts ?
BOND: You spineless paper tiger -
HARMSWAY: We all go down together ! ! ! Harmsway lunges for Bond 's throat -
SIDNEY: What do you mean , you 'd rather die alone ?
BOND: I did n't say when I want to die -
SIDNEY: Before we go any further here , Mr . Bond , from Lloyds of London , I just want to get two things straight .
BOND: Yes ?
SIDNEY: First , that boat is in international waters . I 'm claiming it for salvage . One-third of that gold is mine .
BOND: And number two ?
SIDNEY: If you think we 're going to have some kind of 'life affirming ' romance here just because we cheated death , let me e clear We 're going to have it where I want , and when I want .
BOND: And when might that be ?
SIDNEY: Now .
WADE: Life is not fair .
OFFICER: Excuse me , Major Boothroyd - the message went to London .
WADE: Tell me , Q-ster . You do ever do any gardening ?
SIDNEY: James Is this really what a typical day is like for you ? Bond replies with a wry smile

STINGER: I did n't do it , he did it himself . Something about a wife and kid . The fact is , he 's lost it . He knows it . I know it . You were up there , you know it , too .
GOOSE: Give him a break , Skipper . It was aining snakes up there . He 'll be alright , soon as all the gorillas go home
STINGER: I know some RIOS are a little wiggybut you abuse the priviledge ! I do n't believe I 'm going to have to put the two of you in the same cockpitbut there it is ! It may be good for the Navy . It might be good for you , but most of all , it 's good for me . It 'll get you out of my sight .
GOOSE: But , Skipper , Cougar 's been picked for Top GunHe 's the best of the est !
STINGER: Well , you 'll just have to make do with him .
GOOSE: Mav 's a great flyer but .
STINGER: He 's a hell of a flyer . In fact , he 's so damn good he might have een picked for Top Gun himself . Except for one thing . He just ca n't seem to follow orders !
MAVERICK: Sir ?
STINGER: That is all . Tell me about the MiG some other time
MAVERICK: Yes sir !
STINGER: Maverick..
MAVERICK: Yes sir..
STINGER: The wings..

ICE: Uh oh , police escort . This one must e a real killer .
VIPER: By the end of Vietnam we upped ou kill ratio to thirteen to one .
VIPER: Someone once asked me if training men for air combat made the world less safeflying loaded guns an accidental confrontation and so forth
GOOSE: What are you doing ?
MAVERICK: NothingThat 's McGownthat 's Singer , is n't it ?
GOOSE: Turn around , pay attention . What are you doing ?
MAVERICK: Just wondering who is the best .
VIPER: Really Ya know . We 'd like to know who 's est too . That 's why we 've got that plaque on the wall with the Top Top Gun crew from each class . You think maybe your name 's gon na be on it ?
MAVERICK: Yes sir .
VIPER: Considering the company you 're in , that 's a pretty arrogant attitude .
MAVERICK: Yes sir .
VIPER: I like that in a fighter pilot . It 's okay to be confident . You have to think you 're King Kong to want to try to land on carriers . Just keep in mind the other component of successteamwork .
MAVERICK: Yes sir .
VIPER: Gentlemen , this is about combat . Remember , there are no points fo second place . Dismissed .
WOLFMAN: A plaque ?
HOLLYWOOD: It 's not the plaque . The winner can get assigned here as instructor . He gets to fight every day .
A7 PILOT: You know the Fighter Pilots motto ? It 's better to be dead than to look ad .
GOOSE: I do n't know , Frank , anybody gets off on bombing the shit out of dirt has got to be queer .
MAVERICK: Is there anybody in the Navy you do n't know ?

SLIDER: Why Goose , whose butt did you kiss to get here ?
GOOSE: The list is long , but distinguished .
SLIDER: So 's my Johnson .
GOOSE: This is Maverick .
SLIDER: So I 've heard .
GOOSE: Who 's your pilot ?
SLIDER: Tom Kazansky .
GOOSE: No shit . The Iceman .
SLIDER: Mister to you .
GOOSE: You think you can stay up with us .
SLIDER: I think , yeah , we 'll show you a thing or two .
GOOSE: This is Evan Mitchell , he steers the thing .
SLIDER: So I heard . Steers it pretty close . Sorry to hear about Cougar . He was a good man .
MAVERICK: Still is..
SLIDER: Yeah . That 's what I meant .
GOOSE: Flaming Hooker . Sort of an institution around here . Or maybe this is the institution , I forget which . It 's the house drink . It 'll warm the cockles of your heart and other things depending on where you spill it .
MAVERICK: You ever done this before ?
GOOSE: What , been drunk ? Sure ! Plenty !
SLIDER: How was it ?
GOOSE: Could use a dash more jet fuel .
SUNDOWN: Yeow !
GOOSE: Mayday ! Down in flames !
SUNDOWN: Thanks , I needed that .
HOLLYWOOD: You guys are not only crazy , you 're dangerous !
ICE: Frat boys .
MAVERICK: Who is that guy ?
HOLLYWOOD: That 's Kazanski .
GOOSE: No shit ! That why they call him Ice ?
HOLLYWOOD: Nope . It 's the way he flies - Ice cold . No mistakes . Wears you down . Afte enough time , you just get bored and frustrated , you do something stupid , and he 's got you .
GIRL: Why do you all have such funny names ?
WOLFMAN: You got ta have a call sign that 's just your ownnever changesyou have to recognize it immediately . Then , if someone shouts `` Wolf , eak left ! `` ..you react right away .
GIRL: Why do they call you Wolf ?
WOLDFMAN: Oh , I do n't know .
GOOSE: Hey Mav , this is Sally . She does n't elieve a word I say . Tell her I 'm married , will you ?
MAVERICK: Yeah , he 's marriedbut then again , he , s not dead .
GIRL: Could I get a call sign ?
WOLFMAN: Well , I do n't know . That depends .
GIRL: On what ?
WOLFMAN: Well , it does n't just happen , you got ta do something famous .
GIRL: Like what ?
WOLFMAN: OhI 'll think of something .
ICEMAN: Figured it out yet ?
MAVERICK: Figured out what ?
ICEMAN: Who is the best .
MAVERICK: Nope .
ICEMAN: Need a hint ?
MAVERICK: I think I can work it out on my own .
ICEMAN: You like to work alone . I 've heard that about you .
MAVERICK: I 've heard of you , too . You were in 124 with Bargamian .
ICEMAN: And you were with Cougar . He was my oommate in flight school .
MAVERICK: He 's a good man .
ICEMAN: The best .
SLIDER: You must have soloed under a lucky star . First the MiG , then you slide into Cougar 's place .
GOOSE: It 's not Cougar 's place . It 's ours .
ICE: What do you think it was ? Was it that MiG contact that did it ?
GOOSE: Did what ?
ICE: Got you here .
GOOSE: We 're here because we 're the best flyers in the wing . Not because of some MiG encounter .
SLIDER: What luck ! Guys fly their whole career without seeing a MiG up closeYou 're famous .
ICE: You mean notorious .
MAVERICK: What do these guys think , I made Cougar quit ?
GOOSE: Pay no attention to it . They 're just trying to rattle you . It 's all psychological . Sit down..and drink .
BUGS: We were just really diving down and by then we were right over downtown Haiphong . It was some great shit . Jack says , `` What are you doing ? '' `` What , what am I doing , Jack ? '' He says , `` What are you doing ? '' I said , `` I 'm rolling in , Jack . '' `` Bugs , we 're at thirty-two hundred feet . Oh shit , we were like zooom So we scraped down at hundred feet right overdowntown Hanoi ! Oh shit , goddamn it ! And blowing down the iver . And so once we were there we let down to about fifty feet just going down the river and Jack says `` Bugs do n't ever do that again ! '' `` Okay , right , Jack , I 'll never do that again ! ''
MAVERICK: What , what is it ?
HOLLYWOOD: Target passing . Check your six .
MAVERICK: Never mind mine . Check hers .
HOLLYWOOD: Her six is a ten ! Uh oh , a turn to engage .
WOLFMAN: Bogey9 o'clock level .
SUNDOWN: Nine thirty . Bogey ? You presume that hostile ?
GOOSE: The family unit that 's the most important thing . It 's the only thing you can count on . I 'm married did I tell you that ?
FIRST GIRL: Four times . We do n't believe you .
GOOSE: I 've been married since I was eighteen . Why do n't you believe me ?
SECOND GIRL: Because you do n't look married .
FIRST GIRL: You 're not even wearing a ring .
GOOSE: I take it off when I 'm chasing women . It 's the only honorable thing to do .
HOLLYWOOD: You do n't think about death up there , but you think a lot about the danger . One mistake and you 're a smoking hole in the ground .
GIRL: I never knew it was so dangerous .
HOLLYWOOD: Oh yeah , it makes everything down here more meaningful . You feel a certain intensity of life , and you want to grab onto every moment .
CHARLIE: Long cruise , was it ?
MAVERICK: Lots of things .
CHARLIE: I 'll bet !
MAVERICK: UhhhAnything I can do for you ?
CHARLIE: Yeah . Hold this . It might be safer .
MAVERICK: It 's not that .
CHARLIE: It is n't ?
MAVERICK: Well , it is . It is that , too .
CHARLIE: That 's a big comfort to me .
MAVERICK: I could be , too .
CHARLIE: How so ?
MAVERICK: Save you from a big mistake with that other guy .
CHARLIE: And on to a bigger one with you ?
MAVERICK: Yeah , most likely .
CHARLIE: Was there ever a girl who did n't like fighter pilots ?
MAVERICK: I heard of one once .
CHARLIE: I 'm really flattered , Lieutenant , ut I do n't go out with pilots .
MAVERICK: Then what are you doing here ?
CHARLIE: I think the question iswhat are you ?
MAVERICK: Hi . I 'm here to talk about a new concept in cosmetics
CHARLIE: Sorry .
MAVERICK: My fault . Should have watched where I was going .
MAVERICK: Uh , nobody , I guess .
CHARLIE: Too bad .
CHARLIE: I 'm with someone .
MAVERICK: I thought he 'd never leave .
CHARLIE: Yeow !
MAVERICK: Everybody 's got to be somewhere .
CHARLIE: What if Captain Dawson had come with me ?
MAVERICK: It would have been really embarrassing !
CHARLIE: How did you know this was my car ?
MAVERICK: Simple deduction . It 's fast . It 's pretty . Sleek and stylishIt 's your colormatches your lipstick .
CHARLIE: That 's all !
MAVERICK: And I asked someone .
CHARLIE: You think you 're pretty smart .
MAVERICK: I think I 'm in love .
MARINE: Can I help you , Ma'am ?
CHARLIE: I do n't know , Corporal . Can you do anything about this lunatic ?
FLEX: Not so fastmy head .
JESTER: Who are you ?
SUNDOWN: I 'm Sundown .
JESTER: Yeah , right . You 're late .
VIPER: And who are you ?
FLEX: Flex
VIPER: Flex ? You do n't look like Flex to me . You call that muscle ? Does n't look like muscle . Looks likePork .
PORK: Do n't make an issue of it , it 'll stick .
VIPER: Now to continue . In this class we will be dealing with F-5 's and A4 's , as our MiG simulators . Technically the F-5 does not have the thrust to weight ratio of the MiG-21it also does not bleed energy below 300 knots like the MiG-21 does . The A4 does not turn as well as the MiG-17 but has significantly better visibility .
CHARLIE: Hello , I think I have some new data fo youNow a MiG 21 has a problem with the inverted flight tanks . It wo n't do a Negative G push over . Even below one G , they risk a flame out . Operationally , they will do a zero to one G only .
MAVERICK: I do n't think you 're altogethe ightabout the MiG , that is .
CHARLIE: I beg your pardon .
MAVERICK: No , I beg yours . But I do n't think you 're right on that .
CHARLIE: Why not ?
MAVERICK: I saw one .
CHARLIE: You saw a MiG 21 ?
MAVERICK: I saw a MiG do a 4 G negative dive .
CHARLIE: Where did you see that ?
MAVERICK: It 's classified .
CHARLIE: It 's what ?
MAVERICK: It 's classified . Like Hollywood says , I could tell you , but then I 'd have to kill you .
VIPER: Maverick ! ! !
CHARLIE: It 's all right .
MAVERICK: Not in this case .
CHARLIE: You saw a MiG push negative 4G ?
MAVERICK: Yes , ma'am .
CHARLIE: Where were you ?
MAVERICK: On his six .
CHARLIE: He was in a 4G Negative dive and you were on his six ?
MAVERICK: Yes , ma'am , At first . Then I was directly above him .
CHARLIE: If you were directly above him , how did you see him ?
MAVERICK: I was inverted .
CHARLIE: You were in a 4G inverted dive with a MiG 21 ?
MAVERICK: Two .
CHARLIE: Two miles .
MAVERICK: Two meters .
GOOSE: One and a half , actually . I got a polaroid .
CHARLIE: Lieutenant
MAVERICK: Ma'am ?
CHARLIE: What were you doing there ?
MAVERICK: Giving him the bird .
CHARLIE: The what ?
MAVERICK: You know . The finger .
CHARLIE: So you 're the reason those SALT talks failed .
VIPER: Lieutenant !
GOOSE: It 's just like he says , sir .
VIPER: I do n't care !
MAVERICK: Why did n't you tell me you were a
CHARLIE: It never came up .
MAVERICK: You let me make a fool of myself .
CHARLIE: You seemed determined to do that anyway.. Why did n't you tell me you were a famous MiG insulter ?
MAVERICK: Would it have made a difference ?
CHARLIE: No .
MAVERICK: What would ?
CHARLIE: You know , I 'm assigned to this school . I see sixteen new hotshots every eight weeks . Your attention is flattering , but not really productive . Why do n't you keep you mind on flying .
VIPER: Maverick Where 'd you get that call sign ?
MAVERICK: Ahhh Runs in the family , sir .
VIPER: You 're father was Marvin Mitchell..
MAVERICK: Yes sir .
VIPER: A good man . Good flyer .
MAVERICK: Yes sir . Thank you sir .

MAVERICK: He should 've had me .
GOOSE: Take it down . Let 's bug out of here . Call for a draw .
MAVERICK: No way . I 'll nail him this time . Going vertical .
GOOSE: He 's blind you got him !
JESTER: NO JOY ! NO JOY ! WHERE ARE YOU ? I 'VE LOST SIGHT .
GOOSE: He 's out of energy ! You got control ? Unload !
JESTER: WE 'RE BELOW THE HARD DECK . FIGHT 'S OFF .
GOOSE: He 's right . We 're at ten thousand .
MAVERICK: No way . I got you , sucker . You 're going down .
GOOSE: Goddamn ! We beat him !
JESTER: ROGER FOX TWO . GET YOUR BUTTS ABOVE THE HARD DECK . RETURN TO BASE IMMEDIATELY .
MAVERICK: We did it !
GOOSE: Look , Ma , top of the world !
MAVERICK: Right .
GOOSE: Right . Much better . Ahhhwhat do you call this ?
MAVERICK: It 's a victory roll .
GOOSE: I would n't call it victory . It 's more likeself immolation .
MAVERICK: Come on , relax
GOOSE: You see all those guys with gold on their shoulders ! ! ? Oh , no , I think that was Johnson , Air Boss of the Kitty Hawk !
MAVERICK: Come on , we beat an instructor . How many times in your life do you get to do a victory roll ?
GOOSE: Just once , if they take your plane away .
ICEMAN: Cowboys !
SLIDER: Nice . Always a good idea to show up your instructors .
GOOSE: Hey , see any controls back there ? And anywaywe beat the Son of a Bitch !
WOLFMAN: You won ? ! ! !
MAVERICK: Did n't everybody ?
WOLFMAN: No , wegot our butts kicked .
HOLLYWOOD: Thirty seconds . That 's all it took to blow us out of the sky .
HOLLYWOOD: And he 's laughing . Right over the adio , He 's laughing at us .
GOOSE: You won . Congratulations . HOLLYWOOD Maverick and Goose won too .
ICE: That 's not what I heard .
GOOSE: We won !
ICE: Below the hard deck does n't count . You guys are the second team , are n't you ?
JESTER: Maverick , Goose . Viper 's office . Now !
VIPER: Well.That about covers the flyby .
MAVERICK: I had him in view . I was peeling over the egg , into a dive . He saw me when I moved in for the kill . There was n't any danger
VIPER: Is that how you remember it ?
GOOSE: Yes , sir . By the time we could espond , we were diving right into his view .
VIPER: The hard deck for this hop was ten thousand feet . Jester , at what point did you call off the fight ?
JESTER: Just below ten thousand .
VIPER: But you continued to fight .
MAVERICK: We were n't below for more than ten seconds . There was no danger . I had the shot . I took it .
VIPER: The rules of engagement are not flexible . They exist for you safety . You will obey them . Is that clear ?
VIPER: I guess you were . Dismissed .
JESTER: I do n't know what to tell you , Skip .
VIPER: Tell me one thing .
JESTER: Yep .
VIPER: Yeah , we get one of these guys every damn class . `` Maverick ! ''
WOLFMAN: No . No . Look out , you lost it .
GOOSE: Man , you guys gooned it . Your lase utts are scattered across KANSAS .
HOLLYWOOD: Come on . I died enough for one night .
GOOSE: Have you guys ever considered career counseling ?
GOOSE: What happened .
CHARLIE: You flew it off the template . Nobody ever did that before .
GOOSE: That 's what she said last night .
CHARLIE: What is it about you ?
MAVERICK: What would you say , too fasttoo quick
CHARLIE: And far too aggressive .
MAVERICK: It is combat . Every second counts .
MAVERICK: Well , what you needwhat you have to keep looking forwhat you want to get is a wingman who can stay up with you . Who can match you move for move . Then you 've got something . I 'm sorry .
CHARLIE: For what ?
MAVERICK: That stuff about the MiG . I was out of line .
CHARLIE: Apology acknowledged .
MAVERICK: Is that all ?
CHARLIE: What else do you want ?
MAVERICK: Um . You .
CHARLIE: There you go with those moves again .
MAVERICK: Too aggressive ?
CHARLIE: I do n't mix with the boys . I work here . Let 's keep it professional .
MAVERICK: I 'm special .
CHARLIE: Yes . I 'll give you that !
MAVERICK: Give me a break , I 'm asking you out .
CHARLIE: I ca n't .
MAVERICK: I thought there was something That night in the club
CHARLIE: Lieutenant
MAVERICK: Evan or Maverick .
CHARLIE: Maverickyou know the rules of engagement .
MAVERICK: The what ?
CHARLIE: Some one comes up hot on your six , what do you do ?
MAVERICK: What are you talking about ?
CHARLIE: You turn into him , check him out , identify friend or foe .
MAVERICK: I 'm not your foe .
CHARLIE: And if he 's harmless , you disengage .
MAVERICK: Harmless !
CHARLIE: Uh hum .
MAVERICK: What if he 's not ?
CHARLIE: You have to shoot him down.If he 's smart , he 'll turn away before that happens .
CHARLIE: And probably never again . It 's nothing personal . It 's justI know a lot of pilots . Maybe I 'm immune
MAVERICK: Do n't worry , I 'm a new strain . And I do n't give up . Everything I 've ever wanted I 've had to work like hell for . Well , how about it ?
CHARLIE: How about what ?
MAVERICK: How about anything , anything you want to do .
CHARLIE: Hard to argue with that , is n't it
MAVERICK: A date Coffee A drinkA walk in the park .
CHARLIE: What about the plane ?
MAVERICK: What plane .
CHARLIE: Most of them invite me to sit in the cockpitplay with the levers and things .
MAVERICK: Well , get used to it .
CHARLIE: Used to what ?
MAVERICK: I 'm different .
CHARLIE: I 'm starting to sense that now .
CHARLIE: Make what ?
MAVERICK: Anything .
CHARLIE: Okay , anything . Justgo . I 've got ta work .
CHARLIE: You 're an animal .
MAVERICK: That 's true . What are you ?
CHARLIE: I do n't enjoy watching things suffer .
MAVERICK: It 's not suffering anymore .
CHARLIE: You 're horrible
MAVERICK: You 're not , cause you eat frozen meatballs ? Things die . Every time you breathe , you kill millions of tiny organisms . Every time you eat , something had to die .
CHARLIE: You do n't have to kill it .
MAVERICK: Somebody does . It 's more honest this way . You do your own dirty work .
CHARLIE: You ever think about killing another human being ?
MAVERICK: About as much as they think about killing me .
CHARLIE: Does it bother you ?
MAVERICK: They know the rules That 's the deal . That 's why you 're up there . It 's him or me . That 's the price of admission . It others you , why ? You 're part of it . Everybody dies . Most people do n't get to die fo something .
CHARLIE: Flying ?
MAVERICK: You use your mind to keep things at a distance . You ever just let go ?
CHARLIE: You do n't believe any of this . You do n't think you 'll ever die .
MAVERICK: That 's it , of course . When I 'm up there and doing it , I 'm cheating it every second . I 'm subverting all lawsgravitywhatever . I 'm skating the edge of it .
CHARLIE: Winston Churchill .
CHARLIE: What he said '' There 's nothing so exhilarating as being shot at without result . ''
MAVERICK: All you 've got is one life . I guess it 's worth about the same to every ody . You ever see an old woman after her husband has died ? And the meaningless years of decline stretch ahead When you 're in the air and doing something really dangerous , you can look ahead maybe ten seconds . That 's you whole future . That 's as far as it goes . But imagine what those seconds are worth .
CHARLIE: What if you kill yourself ? Think of everything you 'll miss .
MAVERICK: There is lots of stuff I do n't know about Fine wine great art the opera . I guess if I live long enough , I 'll get to it . If I do n't , I 'll never miss it .
CHARLIE: Are you really that brave ?
MAVERICK: I watched my mother die . Cancer . She had a long time to think about it . They say you reach an agreement with death . Come to accept the fact that pretty soon you wo n't be here . I did n't see that . She was very avebraver than I am . You go up there , there is n't time to think . If you make a mistake , you 're just a smudge on the ground . Simplifies funeral arrangements .
CHARLIE: It 's just as I thought .
MAVERICK: What ?
CHARLIE: You 're totally insane .
MAVERICK: Thanks very much . Care for some suchi ? .
GOOSE: Come on , we 're next .
MAVERICK: What ?
GOOSE: Come on , I got over six bucks on the line .
MAVERICK: I 've had enoughfor now .
CHARLIE: Where ?
MAVERICK: You want to go ballistic ?
CHARLIE: I do n't know . I do n't like being out of control .
MAVERICK: Stick with me , you 'll get used to it .
MAVERICK: I always wanted to fly eve since I first saw a jet . I wanted to fly jets , then I wanted F-14 's , then I wanted to fly off carriers , then I wanted Top Gun .
CHARLIE: And now ?
MAVERICK: And now I want you .
CHARLIE: You always get what you want ?
MAVERICK: I do n't know yet .
CHARLIE: I want it understood .
MAVERICK: Anything .
CHARLIE: No fooling on base , no signs , no comments , no talk . By anyone .
MAVERICK: Why ?
CHARLIE: I 'm a professional . You guys are in my line of work .
MAVERICK: Acknowleged .
VIPER: The bandit has good position right here . All right , freeze here . The moment of choice Maverick is defensive . He has a chance to bug out right here.Better to retire and save your plane than force a ad position . Stay in the diamond another three seconds , the bandit will blow you out of the skymake a hard right , select zone 5 you can extend and escape . You make a bad choice . Roll forward .
MAVERICK: I was n't thinking . I just did it .
VIPER: Big gamble with a thirty million dollar plane !
MAVERICK: No guts , no glory .
SLIDER: Your guts . His glory .
VIPER: Unfortunately , the gamble worked , or you might have learned something . The bandit never gets a clean shotMaverick makes an aggressive vertical move here , comes over the top and defeats the andit with a missile shot . The encounter was a victory , but we 've shown it as an example of what not to do . Ice is next .
HOLLYWOOD: Gutsiest move I ever saw .
VIPER: And the dumbestOkay , look at this . It 's textbook . Ice takes control of the battle immediately . He never gives the bandit a chance to take the offensive . An early turn here excellent . He goes fo the jugular , and it 's over just that quick . Let 's run that again , it 's exactly how it should be done .
GOOSE: What the hell is this ?
MAVERICK: Do n't chew it , you wo n't have it that long . Easier to clean the cockpit if it comes up in big chunks .
JESTER: On the run . Let 's go . Move it !
GOOSE: A fighter pilot 's lunch a hot dog and a puke .
HOLLYWOOD: I was a victim of circumstance .
GOOSE: They should have warned you about that one .
HOLLYWOOD: She 's kinky for flight suitssaid that she 'd never seen so many zippersplayed with them all night . The noise alone kept me up .
GOOSE: What 'd you do ?
HOLLYWOOD: Pulled left , rolled out , underneath .
WOLFMAN: It 's kind of ironic . All you guys have women troubles and I do n't .
HOLLYWOOD: That 's because you do n't have any women .
WOLFMAN: Until last night . Did you see the moves I was making on that girl at the party ?
HOLLYWOOD: The girl with the purple fingernails ?
WOLFMAN: That 's hertall hungry woman with fire in her eyes . It was great .
MAVERICK: It was bad .
WOLFMAN: Bad ?
MAVERICK: The girl with the purple fingernails was Coogan 's sister .
HOLLYWOOD: Coogan spent half the night looking for her . He said he was gon na kill the son-of-a-bitch who ruined his sister .
WOLFMAN: I did n't ruin her .
MAVERICK: You did n't help .
WOLFMAN: No , really . She came ruined ! Ya think he knows it was me ?
GOOSE: Seemed not to . But it 's hard to know . You never can tell what 's in the mind of a psychopath .
HOLLYWOOD: Hear about Ice ?
WOLFMAN: What now ?
HOLLYWOOD: He won again .
GOOSE: Something bothering you ?
MAVERICK: Nothing . Let 's just go fight .
WOLFMAN: How 's it goin ' , Coog ?
HOLLYWOOD: Ever find your sister , Coogan ?
COOGAN: You guys know somethin ' about that ?
JESTER: ROGER . COMING LEFT .
HOLLYWOOD: Holy shit , it 's Viper .
MAVERICK: Keep your shirt on , he 's saying holy shit it 's us .
GOOSE: Bogey at three o'clock high ! Nose on !
VIPER: SNAPSHOT..MISSED HIM..
MAVERICK: ENGAGING THE OTHER GUY . WOOD , YOU 'RE ON YOUR OWN .
GOOSE: Just cover Wood , Maverick . Mutual support , man !
MAVERICK: I 'm gon na take him , Goose .
GOOSE: Do n't be greedy . Stay with Wood .
MAVERICK: I want him !
GOOSE: Hey , come onhey !
MAVERICK: Wood 's okay . I want Viper .
GOOSE: But we 're cover !
MAVERICK: What 's the range , Goose . I 've got a good tone .
GOOSE: Two bogies ! Three o'clock high , nine o'clock high ! Break !
JESTER: ATOLL ON THE NORTHERN F-14 . HE 'S OUT OF THE FIGHT..
VIPER: WALKED RIGHT INTO IT .
JESTER: NOT ONLY THAT , BUT ZORRO GOT YOUR WINGMAN . NICE GOING .
GOOSE: THE DEFENSE DEPARTMENT REGRETS TO INFORM YOU THAT YOUR SONS ARE DEAD BECAUSE THEY WERE STUPID !
VIPER: KNOCK OFF THE CHATTER , TOP GUNS . LET 'S RTB . VIPER HAS THE LEAD .
VIPER: Ya know , that was the best flying I 've seen since Nam Right up to that part where you got killed .
MAVERICK: I lost .
VIPER: Of course you did . I said a great flyer , not a smart one . You fly eckless . Great instincts . No discipline . That ambush today , you followed your emotions instead of your wingman . Of course you got killedand well deserved to . It was a really stupid mistake . In attle , it gets people killed .
MAVERICK: I can take care of myself .
VIPER: Talent is no holy shield . Von Richtofen was killed by a farm boy . Instincts are not enough . Do it ou way . We 've worked these things out . The good pilots can become bette and the great ones can learn how to stay alive . Why do you have to do everything the hard way ?
MAVERICK: It 's my own way . It works for me . I do n't care about the rest of that stuff .
VIPER: Then why are you here ?
MAVERICK: For the same reason you are .
VIPER: Oh , you mean the thrill !
MAVERICK: The flying . The fighting . I 'd go up there ten times a day to fight . I 'd win at least nine of them . That 's all I want to do . It 's what I do best . I am real good . Just give me the jet .
VIPER: It 's not a gift , just a loan
GOOSE: Relationships are a bitch , here . It 's hard enough to concentrate under the pressure . Having a woman here is asking for it .
MAVERICK: I guess that 's what I 'm doing , then .
GOOSE: Where do you find the time ? Where do you find the energy . It 's tough enough to keep your mind on school . A woman here is a real pain in the
CAROL: I had to come , Willard , I got so lonesome I just could n't stand it .
GOOSE: Sure , honey , I understand . It 's great to see you . Hey where 's you ackseater , where 's the world 's smallest RIO..
MAVERICK: Foodand youmy F-14 !
CHARLIE: In that order ?
MAVERICK: Well noinverse order .
CHARLIE: I 'm still second best .
MAVERICK: You ever fly an F-14 ?
CHARLIE: I do n't fly in anything that does n't show movies .
MAVERICK: Ahhh , you 'd love it . Night carrie landings ! The most dangerous thing you can think of ! next to youAnd the most exciting . You 're living at one hundred and ten pe cent . Greatest high in the world
CHARLIE: Danger ?
MAVERICK: . Yeah !
CHARLIE: Does n't it ever bother you ?
MAVERICK: Why , what 's gon na happen ?
CHARLIE: What do you take me for ? It 's a Navy Cross .
MAVERICK: Just good luck .
CHARLIE: Where 'd you get it .
MAVERICK: Pawn shop . What 's to eat ?
ICE: ENGAGING BANDIT 12 O'CLOCK .
MAVERICK: SHIT ! !
ICE: MIG 'S IN A LEFT . MIG 'S IN A LEFTHAND . I 'M ENGAGING .
MAVERICK: COME OFF RIGHTCOME OFF HIGHI 'M INI 'LL ENGAGE .
ICE: STAY WHERE YOU ARE . HE 'S MINE . I 'M ENGAGED . I 'M IN .
MAVERICK: FIRE , OR CLEAR OUT , ICE .
ICE: GET LOST !
MAVERICK: YOU GOT TOO MUCH NOSE TO TAIL I 'M COMING IN .
ICE: IT 'S MY SHOT .
MAVERICK: COME OFFCOME OFF RIGHT . I 'M ON MY WAY IN . YOU GO FREE , I 'M ENGAGING .
ICE: STAY OUT OF IT . STAY OUT OF IT , MAVERICK .
MAVERICK: YOU CA N'T SHOOT HIM , I CAN . I 'M IN .
ICE: NO , NO , NO , HE 'S MINE .
MAVERICK: IF YOU CA N'T SHOOT HIM , I CAN .
ICE: NO , I GOT HIM . I CAN TAKE HIM .
MAVERICK: COMING IN .
ICE: Sonofabitch .
GOOSE: Oh , no !
MAVERICK: I 'm pinned to the panel .
GOOSE: Time to go .
MAVERICK: I ca n't eject .
GOOSE: 3000 feet . I 'll do it .
MAVERICK: Go ahead . I ca n't reach . 2000 feet !
GOOSE: 1000 .
MAVERICK: Let 's go . Eject .
FROGMAN: Let him go , sir . Take it easy .
VIPER: How do you feel ?
MAVERICK: All right .
VIPER: Goose is dead .
MAVERICK: I know . I was there .
VIPER: If you fly jets long enough , something like this happens to you . No one escapes it . It touches us all .
MAVERICK: He wasmy responsibilitymy RIO .
VIPER: My first squadron in Vietnam , we lost eight out of eighteen planes . Ten guys . The first one kills you , ut there 'll be othersyou can count on it .
CHARLIE: they say you 're alright .
MAVERICK: I 'm fine .
CHARLIE: This is it , then .
MAVERICK: What ?
CHARLIE: The dark side . The price you pay for all the fun you 're having . You knew about it , of course . Did n't you ?
MAVERICK: He was a friend of mine . A good guygreat guy . It was my fault .
CHARLIE: That 's not what I hear .
MAVERICK: I was flyingmy responsibility .
CHARLIE: That 's what you get flight pay for .
MAVERICK: Maybe I should n't take it .
CHARLIE: Why ? You act like you did n't know one day this would happen .
MAVERICK: Not to me .
CHARLIE: You knew it . You all do . It 's part of it . Maybe the most important part .
MAVERICK: Where are we ?
CHARLIE: Where are we ? You know where we are . It 's called the beach . It 's where life first crawled up out of the sea . I come here sometimes when I feel like crawling back in .
MAVERICK: You do n't have to do this .
CHARLIE: Do what , show you a good time ?
MAVERICK: I 'm not good company . I should be alone .
CHARLIE: I do n't think so , but if that 's what you want
MAVERICK: No .
CHARLIE: What do you want ?
MAVERICK: I want it back .
CHARLIE: What ?
MAVERICK: Yesterday .
CHARLIE: You look way out there . Out past the date line . West becomes East , all things change . You cross the linetoday becomes yesterdayo tomorrow , I forget which .
MAVERICK: That 's what I want .
CHARLIE: Of course the line 's just imaginary . You can cross it twenty timesnothing really changes .
MAVERICK: If we knew then , what we know now , we might never have come up out of there .
CHARLIE: You do n't believe that .
MAVERICK: Hardly ever .
CHARLIE: Only when you 're depressed . Then it passes .
MAVERICK: It does .
CHARLIE: Everything passes . Immutable law of the Universe .
MAVERICK: What do you do when you come here ?
CHARLIE: I sit . I think . I play games .
MAVERICK: What kind of games ?
CHARLIE: I like to play `` reality '' .
MAVERICK: How do you play reality .
CHARLIE: It 's strip reality , actually , like what the pilots always want to play .
MAVERICK: Strip reality ! How do you play that ?
CHARLIE: It 's like strip poker , only , without the bluffing . One person says something and if the other one accepts that it 's true , the one who says it , gets to take one item of clothing off .
MAVERICK: You 're crazy . That 's a pretty silly game .
CHARLIE: Not as silly as some . You know the silliest one ? that we are gods . That we control events on the each that we can turn back time
MAVERICK: How does it go ?
CHARLIE: You say the truth . Go ahead . Do n't be afraid . You want to win the game , don'tcha ?
MAVERICK: What truth ?
CHARLIE: The big one . The one that 's most on your mind .
MAVERICK: Goose is dead .
CHARLIE: True .
MAVERICK: Now ?
CHARLIE: Take something off .
MAVERICK: Off me or off you ?
CHARLIE: That 's up to you .
MAVERICK: It was my fault .
CHARLIE: You ca n't bring him back .
MAVERICK: It was my fault .
CHARLIE: Nope . Already used that .
MAVERICK: What does it mean ?
CHARLIE: That was n't fair . It was a question . Penalty round !
MAVERICK: That 's three .
CHARLIE: And that 's one !
MAVERICK: One more .
CHARLIE: Your watch .
MAVERICK: You owe me one .
CHARLIE: Looks like a tie .
MAVERICK: Who 's gon na win ?
CHARLIE: We 'll say it together . On the count of threeOnetwo
BOTHTOGETHER: I love.ove y.you .
FUNGUS: BOGEY AT TEN O'CLOCK LOW . YOU 'VE GOT THE ANGLE PIECE OF CAKE .
MAVERICK: DID N'T AHHHLOOK GOOD .
FUNGUS: WHAT DO YOU MEAN ? IT DOES N'T GET TO LOOK MUCH BETTER THAN THAT ?
MAVERICK: NO . NO GOOD .
JESTER: He just wo n't engage . He ca n't do it , Skipper . He ca n't get back on the horse .
VIPER: It 's only been a week . Keep sending him up .
JESTER: I 've seen this before .
VIPER: So have I .
JESTER: Some guys never get it back .
FUNGUS: What are you doing ?
MAVERICK: Saving them some paperwork .
FUNGUS: Since when did you care about paperwork ?
MAVERICK: Not anymore .
FUNGUS: So , you 're scaredso what ? You ever get a good look at me in the ack seat , I 'm goddamn terrified .
CHARLIE: Never liked fighter pilots anyway .
MAVERICK: You came to the right place .
CHARLIE: I 'll have what he 's having Hemlock , is it ?
MAVERICK: I was , later .
CHARLIE: Long distance ? I would n't do that to you . I 'd at least talk to you .
MAVERICK: I did n't want to see you . I mean , I didbut I didn't..
CHARLIE: I know exactly what you mean .
MAVERICK: How could you ?
CHARLIE: I 've got a gift just like you do . My gift is I just know what people mean , even if they ca n't say it . It helps when you 're trying to communicate with fighter pilots . Like what you just said was `` I 'm embarrassed , I feel I 've done something wrong , that I 've failed , and I do n't think I can live up to the expectations of a wonderful interesting , intelligent woman like yourself . '' That about it ?
MAVERICK: Something like that .
CHARLIE: And I 'm gon na sneak off , and be by myself for awhile , like until I can think of a new careerhotel management or something
MAVERICK: Big talk for someone who 's neve een shot off her computer .
CHARLIE: Hey , I never said I was a fighte pilotI never claimed to think it was fun to be shot off the end of a ship in a storm . I can find contentment in a good book . I do n't have to roar by someone at Mach two with my hair on fire . SometimesI just get happy being with the right man .
MAVERICK: I hope you find him .
CHARLIE: I think I have I could be wrong . I have been before . Just remembe one thing . If you 're not Top Gun , if you 're not fighting jets , you 're not gon na be able to act like a fighter pilot You 're gon na have to act like the rest of us . You 're gon na have to master humility . Fo you guys , that 's the toughest maneuver of all .
TIM: DadOf all the aminals in the ocean , which one 's the baddest ?
VIPER: I do n't know , Tim . You 'll have to ask them .
MAVERICK: Skipper , sorry to bother you .
VIPER: No bother .
MAVERICK: I called your house .
VIPER: My wife 's house .
MAVERICK: She said you took your kid to the each . Every second Sunday . Zoo o each or the ballgame . Y'have the option What about me ?
VIPER: We can send you back to you squadron with nothing noted on you ecord except `` CNC '' course not completed , no explanation required . Theoretically , it does n't hurt you career , but people always wonde about things like that .
MAVERICK: Or .
VIPER: Or you can quit .
MAVERICK: I do n't know
VIPER: I did n't know either . That 's why I told Jester to prepare your papers .
MAVERICK: You 've already made up your mind .
VIPER: It 's no disgrace , kid . That spin was hell . It would wreck anyone 's confidence . You could be a good pilot again someday
MAVERICK: You think I should quit ? !
VIPER: I did n't say that . That 's up to you . But I have responsibility fo the other guys up there , not just you . They need to know you 're all ightthat they can depend on you .
MAVERICK: Here , let me get this . We 'll be even .
VIPER: Sometimes it 's luck , but in this case , he earned it I served with your old man .
MAVERICK: I know .
VIPER: VF 51 , the Oriskany . You remind me of him . You 're just like he was , only betterand worse .
MAVERICK: I 'm nothing like him .
VIPER: You may not think so , but you are .
MAVERICK: He was by the book , all the way .
VIPER: They waved him off . He thought he knew better . He hit the amp .
MAVERICK: I never heard that .
VIPER: Not something they tell dependents .
MAVERICK: It 's not true .
VIPER: Why would I lie ?
MAVERICK: How can I go on ? I feel so esponsible .
VIPER: Kid , the plain fact isyou are . I 'm not gon na stand here and blow sunshine up your ass . Technically , they absolved you . You and I know what really happened . You pushed it . You are responsible and you 'll always carry that . You know what , I 'll carry it too . I should have taken you out of that cockpit . I guess I 'm a hopeless romantic I always try to find something worthwhile in someone 's death . It 's no trade-off . It 's not one for one . What you learned is n't worth his death . It could n't be . But maybe there is some value in it . I know it 's the first thing I 've ever seen that 's really gotten to you . Now the question is , what will you do with it . If it gets you out of flight statusso you do n't kill yourself or anybody elsethat 's good . That 's one good thing . You were an accident waiting to happen .

QUAIL: No . Go to Mars .
KIRSTEN: Go to hell .
QUAIL: We can pool our savings and I 've got some sick leave coming , besides my regula vacation
KIRSTEN: more of a half-wit . Fo a start a war could break out there any day

NEWSCASTER: but Earth Intelligence Operations Director Vilos Cohaagen , clearly worried about the damage to Mars 's all important tourist industry was today dismissive of the dissident groups .
COHAAGEN: We 're dealing with a bunch of extremists and unrepresentative lunatics . Mars is a happy and prosperous protectorate of Earth and will remain so .

QUAIL: You 've compromised the Sphinx Project . You 'll have to be silenced . Now they 're all panicked . McCLANE Wait a minute . Quail
LULL: He wants a false memory implanted of a trip he eally took . Someone at Earth Intelligence Operations erased his memory . All he know was going to Mars meant something special to him .
ERNIE: What do we do ? Graft a false memory pattern over the real memory of the same thing ?
LULL: Uh-uh That could promote a partial breakthrough of the real trip . McCLANE Revive him without any false memory implantation and get him out of here .

SUPERVISOR: Absolutely , sir . He thinks he 's Quail , a computer
COHAAGEN: Then how do you explain what he 's doing ?
SUPERVISOR: Just his instincts . He was well trained by E.I.O . Maybe the memory cap 's fractured . Portions of his prior identity could be leaking through .
COHAAGEN: He 'll remember Mars ? The Sphinx Project ?

EDGEMAR: My card , Mr. Quail .
QUAIL: Okay so you 're Docto George Edgemar of 'Rekall , Inc. ' So ?
EDGEMAR: As I said this is going to e very difficult for both of us .
QUAIL: I 'm listening .
EDGEMAR: Mr. Quail I 'm afraid you 're not really standing here at this moment .
QUAIL: Sat that again .
EDGEMAR: I said , you 're not really here . Neither am I . We 're oth in the Memory Studio in the offices of Rekall , Inc. On Earth . Long pause .
QUAIL: Are you trying to tell me that this is all part of some artificially injected fantasy ? That I never really left Earth ?
EDGEMAR: No , not quite . We did n't give you this . You 're creating it yourself Remember the option we offered you ? Intelligence agent ? Something inside you liked that idea , fastened on it . What you 're experiencing now is a free-form delusion that you yourself are fabricating .
QUAIL: What is this shit you 're giving me ?
EDGEMAR: This is not shit , Mr. Quail . It 's the truth . I know it 's very hard for you to accept , but you 're having a schizophrenic reaction we ca n't snap you out of the Narkadine . You 're in a world of your own fantasy .
QUAIL: Then how the hell can you be in my dream if you know it 's just a dream ?
EDGEMAR: I 've been artificially implanted like the first part of your fantasy . I 'm actually monitoring your dream at a psychoprobe console . This is a last resort . When somebody gets stuck in thei own fantasy , we send in someone after them . A specialist , like myself .
QUAIL: I do n't believe a word you 're saying .
EDGEMAR: I was afraid you 'd think that . I 'm sorry to have to do this , ut you really are stuck . Doctor Noel , would you come in now please ?
MELINA: Yes , Mr. Quail , I 'm afraid it 's all true . Quail is staggered .
QUAIL: So what 's supposed to happen now ?
EDGEMAR: Just do exactly as we tell you .
QUAIL: Somehow that does n't appeal to me .
MELINA: Please , Mr. Quail try to cooperate . You 're having a schizophrenic embolism .
EDGEMAR: If we ca n't get you out now you may never come out of it . Your wife calls every day
QUAIL: If this is a fantasy , there 'll e no real consequences when I pull this trigger .
EDGEMAR: But there will by consequences inside your mind . Consequences that wo n't hurt me but could e fatal to you . If you shoot me , you 'll wipe me out of your fantasy I ca n't come back again . Because to you , I 'll be dead . I ca n't help you get back to reality . You 'll be stuck in permanent psychosis .
MELINA: Watch out , Charles ! There 's more of them in the hall !
QUAIL: What happens it I come out ?
WAITER: Would n't you prefer your orde in your room , sir ?
QUAIL: In !
MELINA: They kidnapped me . Said they 'd kill you if I did n't cooperate . I told them I did n't care , but then when I realized they meant it
QUAIL: I do n't know why they 're after me , but what 's you connection with all this ?
MELINA: We were together before .
QUAIL: Believe me , I 'm really sorry I ca n't recall the details of that encounter .
MELINA: Go , Bennie , for God 's sake !
BENNIE: Bad news , boss lady .
MELINA: What ?
BENNIE: Black cruiser just pull out ehind us .
QUAIL: Lose them ? In this ?
BENNIE: Hang on !
QUAIL: ( shouts ove
GUNFIRE: You 're gon na get a ticket for that engine , Bennie
BENNIE: Yutani 650 you like it , oss ? Nothing like the old gas when you want a bit of speed . BULLETS from the cruiser rip through the car .
MELINA: You better have two aces , Bennie . There 's a second cruiser and it 's gaining
COHAAGEN: I take it , then , you 've failed to get him again .
EMILE: But , sir
COHAAGEN: With him on the lose , I 'm not taking any more chances . Operation Sphinx will flush him out .
QUAIL: What 's all this ?
BENNIE: Nothin ' , boss . Just old smokies . Only place they can come for a puff . It 's all banned topside .
QUAIL: So you two are into something a bit more serious than the taxi and truck-stop business .
BENNIE: That 's right , boss .
QUAIL: My God ! T-shirts . They died out on Earth years ago .
BENNIE: Well , maybe we ai n't fashion leaders , boss .
MELINA: No . But we still believe in a free Mars .
QUAIL: So where did I fit into all this ?
MELINA: You - when you were Charles Hauser with E.I.O - infiltrated our group . I guess Cohaagen did n't trust you any more when you and
QUAIL: Yeah . And I ca n't even emember it . We 'll have to arrange a return bout .
MELINA: so he had your memory wiped and fixed you up with a new identity .
QUAIL: But - the Sphinx . Why is that stuck in my mind ? Why 's it so important ?
MELINA: I do n't know .
BENNIE: Just an ole heap o ' stone , oss .
QUAIL: It 's more than that , Bennie , I know it 's more . Somehow it 's connected . He slumps into a chair with frustration .
MELINA: Maybe there 's a way you can get your memory back .
QUAIL: How ? What ? Where ? When ?
MELINA: A bit of Martian Wisdom . We 're not all stupid colonists .
QUAIL: What ? Why ?
MELINA: Clearing everyone out ! It 's een rumored for months
QUAIL: Wow . I can see why I was willing to betray E.I.O .
MELINA: I though you believed in our cause ?
QUAIL: Yes . Of course . That , too . They move into the crowd . The message on the loudspeaker is repeated .
STRANGE MAN: Your servant , Fahreem Kuato . I greet you by the twenty-seven names that still emain , praying that you cast jewels into the darkness and given them to glow with the colors of life .
QUAIL: What use is this weirdo ?
MELINA: Sssshthere are skills on mars that Earth has forgotten .
KUATO: No need to introduce yourself , Mr. Quail . Tolerate my presumption , but it does not tax my powers to know that you are the most sought-after man on two worlds .
QUAIL: And you 're going to help me y reading my mind ?
KUATO: Indubitably . There is only small matter of a fee .
QUAIL: A fee !
KAUTO: Naturally .
MELINA: This is for our cause !
KUATO: Income before ideals . Shall we say five-hundred-thousand dollars ?
QUAIL: Five-hundred-thousand Martian dollars , that 's
KUATO: Not Martian dollars , Mr. Quail - Earth dollars .
MELINA: That 's interplanetary robbery !
QUAIL: With today 's exchange rate that 's over two million Martian dollars !
KUATO: What price do you put , Mr. Quail , on the future of the solar system ?
BENNIE: Aw , come off it , man . Just for a bit of mumbo-jumbo with a crystal ball .
KUATO: Listen , buster , we 're talking heavy stuff here . You try and work out what 's with this guy ! He jerks his thumb toward Quail .
QUAIL: Okay ! Okay ! I 'll pay it , ut the Interstellar Trade Practices Commission might e interested in this . Everyone calms down .
KUATO: Retrieving the past is like walking backwards along a perilous road . The half-recalled , the half-forgotten , the repressed , the fantasies , the triumphs , joys , failures , betrayals He closes his eyes and concentrates .
ORACLE HEAD: Do not fear me . I need you openness
MELINA: Charles ! Are you all right ?
BENNIE: You stopped breathing !
QUAIL: Why did you kill him ? It was the next bit I really
BENNIE: No choice , boss . It was him or you .
ORACLE HEAD: the vengence you seek and the salvation of Mars are waiting for you in the crown of the Sphinx .
BENNIE: Phobos and Demos ! What was that all about ?
MELINA: Are you okay ? Charles ? Doug ? Whoever ?
BENNIE: Well you go outta here take a left , then down past the first no second water bureau you
QUAIL: Can you get us there ?
BENNIE: No problem .
MELINA: But why ?
QUAIL: We 're going to the Sphinx .
BENNIE: Impossible , man . Guards everywhere .
MELINA: The Oracle what did you learn ?
QUAIL: Only everything . I 've got total recall .
BENNIE: We 'll never get near the Sphinx ! They 'll blow us apart !
MELINA: What are we doing , Charles ? For God 's sake , tell us .
QUAIL: The Sphinx it 's not some useless artifact , it 's a machine built by some alien ace eighteen millions years ago . The same race that uilt the on one Earth for the same purpose .
BENNIE: It 's a hunk of old stone , man .
MELINA: Purpose ? What purpose ? Bennie starts the engine .
QUAIL: Come on , Bennie , move it . Have you heard the word , `` terriform '' ?
BENNIE: Just deliverin ' some old junk to the mine out at Apidalia Planitia . Got them people you 're lookin ' for in the ack as well . The Guards laugh and signal him on .
QUAIL: The machine in the Sphinx is tapped straight down to the molten core of this planet . There are tunnels and ducts everywhere , all powered by fusion generators
BENNIE: You sure the little man did n't fry your brain , Quail ?
MELINA: For what ? To do what ?
QUAIL: To combine elements in the Martian core and release them as oxygen , hydrogen and nitrogen .
BENNIE: That 's air !
QUAIL: That 's right . Air and water . Terriforming will create a permanent livable environment for Mars . No more pressurized cities , no more containers in the desert . There 'll be ivers , vegetation - life - the same as Earth .
MELINA: So why is Cohaagen shipping everyone out ?
QUAIL: Do n't you see ? ! From being a pile of red dirt with minerals , Mars is going to change into a chunk of priceless real estate .
MELINA: And Cohaagen 's going to own it all !
QUAIL: Right ! He can start selling it off to well-heeled investors from Earth . Beach condos , ski esorts , you name it .
MELINA: No wonder he wanted you to penetrate out group .
QUAIL: Once word of this gets out , the whole planet will support you .
MELINA: So what can we do ?
QUAIL: Ruin his little scheme by terriforming ahead of schedule - while the inhabitants are still here . Melina is amazed .
MELINA: But who 'll work the machine ? Do you know how ?
QUAIL: I 'm the only one who does . Why do you think Cohaagen 's left me alone all this time ?
MELINA: But Cohaagen wiped you memory ! ! !
QUAIL: Just a way of putting me on ice . He 'd of reversed it once the planet was evacuated .
BENNIE: Man ! This is real complicated . Go over it again , real slow .
QUAIL: What he had n't counted on was your effect on me .
MELINA: And all without the marvels of modern science !
QUAIL: Bennie , do n't stop now , take it
MELINA: You bastard .
BENNIE: Like I said . It 's a tough planet . I 'm a baddie , not a goodie .
QUAIL: I should have known , you were just too helpful .
BENNIE: EIO Rule One , man . Trust Nobody . Now you can do your terriforming stuff ight when those space shuttles are gone .
MELINA: But what about the Martian people ? Out cause ? I thought you believed in it .
BENNIE: Your cause ? That bunch of dead beat radicals ! When I hand in this little number I 'll get real estate rights on the whole of Chryse Planitia
QUAIL: Hope I 've got this direction ight .
COHAAGEN: The air supply is off unde the domes ?
EMILE: Yes , sir . In a couple of hours it 'll be all gone .
COHAAGEN: Any trouble with the rabble ?
EMILE: Not much , sir . A lot of complaining . But they 're all heading towards the shuttle areas .
MELINA: We got in with this thing , ut we 'll never get back out .
QUAIL: A shame . Such a pleasant trip .
MELINA: Remind me not to slip .
QUAIL: The new elements will come ooming up through this shaft and six thousand others all around the planet . He 's right at home and full of confidence .
GUARD LEADER: Stay in contact . I want to hear from this checkpoint every four minutes .
GUARD #1: Did you hear something ?
GUARD #2: No . Where ?
GUARD #1: Over there .
GUARD #2: Yeah ? Likewho was that guy ? Fred Bond ? ? Keep 'em up , Fred , keep 'em up .
GUARD #1: A hologram !
MELINA: Where 'd you get that little trick ?
QUAIL: Mail-order company . It 's a great one for fooling the wife .
COHAAGEN: How the hell did they get in ?
SECURITY AIDE: Up the fusion core .
COHAAGEN: Up the fusion core ? ? He exhibits begrudging admiration for Quail .
SECURITY AIDE: They 're on Level One .
COHAAGEN: Seal all upper levels .
QUAIL: Know how to use one of these ?
MELINA: Great stuff , but how do we get up ? She points toward the upper levels .
COHAAGEN: Forget them . We 'll pick up Quail once the shuttles have left for Earth .
QUAIL: If you 're afraid of the heights , you better get over it real quick .
EMILE: If Quail 's the only one who can operate all this then he can call all the shots .
COHAAGEN: We 'll tell him the computer 's worked out the operational details so we do n't really need him . We 're just doing him a favor .
EMILE: And if that does n't work ?
COHAAGEN: We offer him rewards .
EMILE: What if that does n't work ?
COHAAGEN: We 'll torture him . You do n't think I got this far by being a nice guy ?
OPERATOR: First of the shuttles ready for departure , sir . Two minute countdown .
COHAAGEN: Seal the breach ! Repressurize !
MELINA: Those shuttles are starting up any minute . If you know how to work this thing , you bette do it now .
QUAIL: Yes He hesitates .
MELINA: Do n't you know how ?
QUAIL: Yes there 's a vital connection missing
COHAAGEN: Wait !
MELINA: Do n't wait !
COHAAGEN: If you activate the mechanism you 'll diethere were glimpses of it in you memory .
QUAIL: Wrong , Cohaagen , there 's a long tunnel , a brilliant white light , hands reaching for me
COHAAGEN: That 's your death . That 's what it looks like . That 's what is always looks like . Quail looks around him , half-convinced .
MELINA: Charles - for Mars 's sake .
COHAAGEN: It 's not too late . Join us again . U 've a lot to offer . A whole world . Quail continues to look at him , thoughtfully .
QUAIL: You do n't deserve a new world , you and people like you made too big a mess of the old one . Time someone else had a chance .
MASKED MINER: I wo n't lie to you , pal . You are . MINER I 'd say in about forty years come on , we 've got ta get to the Space Port . That Intergalactic Napoleon 's switched off the air .
2ND MINER: Shippin ' us all out . Mars is finished . A MINER 'S WIFE watches them . She is crying .
MELINA: It 's happening .
MINER: What is it ?
QUAIL: That 's just the start . Next there 'll be rain and growth and life . Melina embraces him .
WAITER: She 's waiting for someone .
YOUNGER WAITER: Probably waiting for me .
WAITER: The door 's waiting for you if you do n't get back to work .
MESSENGER: C'est vous , Mademoiselle ?
CARA: Oui .
YOUNGER WAITER: Mademoiselle ! Je vous en prie
WIFE: What are you doing Vincent ? Ou train car is over here !
CARA: Ow !
FRANK: Sorry ! Excuse me . Pardone moi .
CARA: I think I 'm going to need you help . Frank is barely able to respond .
FRANK: Hmm ?
CARA: My zipper It 's stuck .
FRANK: I 'm afraid of hurting you .
CARA: Do n't be afraid .
FRANK: I 'm sorry . Cara 's eyes flash fury for a brief moment .
CARA: It does n't matter .
FRANK: Maybe I should let you do this
CARA: Do n't give up so quickly .
FRANK: My name is Frank .
CARA: Cara . A white-jacketed STEWARD arrives .
STEWARD: Will you and your wife take dinne here or in the dining car this evening , monsieur ?
FRANK: Pardon me ? Oh , no . We 're not actually
CARA: The dining car would be lovely , thank you .
FRANK: What ? No .
CARA: So you decided to take a holiday on the Orient Express ? He hesitates .
FRANK: I 'm on my honeymoon .
CARA: Your honeymoon ? Cara is annoyed at this revelation .
FRANK: She 's in Pennsylvania . Off her questioning look
CARA: If you 'd like to tell me .
FRANK: Two weeks ago she left me . Fo the owner of a pizza parlor .
CARA: That 's awful . Frank nods , matter-of-fact .
FRANK: No travel insurance . No refund on the tickets . So here I am . On my honeymoon .
CARA: I 'm sorry , Frank .
FRANK: I really loved that pizza too . `` Bala Pizza '' if you 're ever in Rosemont .
CARA: I would n't touch it . I 'm loyal to you . A waiter delivers their drinks .
WAITER: A Cointreau for Mademoiselle . And for Monsieur a `` Miller Light . ''
FRANK: Thanks .
CARA: You read spy novels .
FRANK: Okay you 'd be a diplomatic attaché or let 's see a girl from East Germany whose father 's been kidnapped by Soviet agents . They 're blackmailing you into stealing probably a microchip . There 's usually a microchip involved .
CARA: What awaits me ?
FRANK: Trouble , certainly .
CARA: Danger ?
FRANK: No doubt . You 'll probably be shot at in less than two chapters .
CARA: Is there a man in my life ? Beat .
FRANK: Maybe .
JONES: We 're putting a lot resources into this investigation , John . Tell me you 're going to get him this time .
ACKERMAN: We 're going to get him this time , Ms. Jones .
GOYAL: She 's on the train . They 'll be in Venice in the morning .
ACKERMAN: Our target 's name is Alexande Pearce . British citizen , born in London into an ordinary middle class family . The only thing emarkable about his childhood was a preternatural gift for numbers .
JEAN LUC: Your mastermind could n't pass his exams on his own ?
ACKERMAN: He did n't fix his test scores ; he fixed the scores for all the girls in the class . It made him very popular . A ripple of laughter through the group .
QUINN: You 've assembled quite a task force to catch a common money launderer , Mr. Ackerman .
ACKERMAN: There is nothing common about Alexander Pearce . Quiet simply , he has turned money laundering into an art form . His greatest innovation The False Lawsuit .
QUINN: The money travels from America to the Cayman Islands
ACKERMAN: Yes , but now the money is legal .
JONES: Not quite legal . The I.R.S . has een cheated out of the revenue . We calculate that Mr. Pearce 's tax ill currently stands at $ 743.7 million dollars . Jean Luc leans toward his colleague .
JEAN LUC: That explains what the American harridan is doing here . Ms. Jones gives him a glacial stare .
JONES: Exactement , monsieur .
ACKERMAN: Mr. Pearce has some other debts as well . Most of you will recognize Ivan Demidov
JONES: The U.S. Government is not participating in an investigation of a member of the Russian parliament ; our target is Alexander Pearce . Ackerman smiles coolly at her .
ACKERMAN: Of course .
SPECIALIST: This is gon na take a few minutes .
CARA: I 'll be ready in fifteen minutes .
ACKERMAN: Where is he ?
QUINN: How do you know about it ?
ACKERMAN: Pearce worked with no more than a few accomplices at one time . He treated them so well that they 're virtually all completely loyal . None of them would cooperate . We 've questioned the ones we could find , and the only thing we learned is that Pearce apparently arranged it so even his own people have never seen him after the surgery .
JEAN LUC: So nobody knows what he looks like ?
ACKERMAN: Correct .
JEAN LUC: Forgive me for saying so Mr. Ackerman , but he slipped away from you when you knew his whereabouts and his appearance What makes you think you can catch him now ? Ackerman regards him with aplomb .
ACKERMAN: His girlfriend was recently eleased from custody . He 'll come for her . We 'll be waiting .
QUINN: What makes you so certain ? Ackerman clicks on a slide .
ACKERMAN: He 'll come for her .
FRANK: I was afraid I 'd missed you . I wanted to ask where you 're staying in Venice I 'm supposed to catch a shuttle to my hotel but I thought maybe
CARA: I 've got a better idea . She holds out her valise for him .
RECEPTIONIST: Si , Signorina .
CARA: Signora . That 's my husband .
RECEPTIONIST: Very good , Senora Mason . Welcome to the Danieli . You are in the Doge 's our premiere suite . Is there anything special you equire ?
CARA: Have a copy of today 's Herald Tribune sent up to the room please .
RECEPTIONIST: My pleasure , Signora .
PORTER: The bedroom is through here . You have two bathrooms , here and here . There is a small kitchen which
CARA: Yes . Thank you .
PORTER: Then I will leave you .
CARA: You like it ?
FRANK: What 's not to like ?
CARA: I 'd have been bored here on my own . There 's more than enough oom for two .
FRANK: I can see that .
CARA: I did n't ask for an extra bed
FRANK: No , no , no . The sofa 's fine . Perfect in fact . Before he can say more , the buzzer sounds .
CARA: The luggage .
FRANK: I 'll get it . He goes back inside to answer the door .
CARA: Have you ever been to Venice efore ? He shakes his head .
GOYAL: She 's checked into the Danieli she 's not alone .
ACKERMAN: Good . Maintain surveillance but keep your distance .
DEMIDOV: Take a seat , Mr. Quinn . Can I offer you a glass of Brunello ? It 's a '97
QUINN: No thank you , Mr. Demidov . Demidov swirls his glass .
DEMIDOV: You know I 'd never admit this at home , but Vodka is for peasants . There 's much we could learn from the Italians .
QUINN: I do n't think so .
DEMIDOV: He always had good taste
QUINN: Mr. Demidov if I may ask you a question Why do you care so much about Alexander Pearce ? I mean , you 've come here yourself as if it were personal . Demidov looks at Quinn thoughtfully .
DEMIDOV: It may be difficult for you to understand , Mr. Quinn ; you Swiss are mercenary by nature . But fo some of us , there are things more important than money . I put my trust in Alexander Pearce . He etrayed that trust .
CARA: So when you 're not on a Grand European Tour , what do you do in Rosemont , Pennsylvania ?
FRANK: I 'm a teacher . High school math . And you ? What do you do ?
CARA: This is what I do , Frank .
FRANK: You 're good at it .
CARA: Oh look a wedding . How lovely .
FRANK: I 'm not really into weddings at this particular moment in my life
CARA: Oh yes . I forgot .
FRANK: Hmm ?
CARA: Maybe she 'll change her mind . Women do . She might give you a second chance .
FRANK: I suppose that 's a possibility . That 's what I tell my statistics class anyway ; life is a game of chance . Endless possibilities and permutations . You just have to calculate the odds .
CARA: You have n't answered the question .
FRANK: Well I 'd like to think that love is a question of destiny , not chance Cara looks at him curiously .
CARA: For a moment there you just eminded me of somebody . She shakes her head and takes a sip of wine .
FRANK: He does n't sound like much of a friend .
CARA: He was n't . Frank glances at her wrist .
FRANK: So why are you wearing his watch ? She looks up at him .
CARA: You 're smarter than you look , Frank .
FRANK: What ? No , I ca n't . This thing must be worth a fortune
CARA: I insist . You 're doing me a favor . Take it or I 'll toss it in the ocean .
FRANK: I 'll wear it until you regain you senses .
CARA: It suits you .
FRANK: I could get used to this .
CARA: You should leave Venice tomorrow . It 's a city for lovers Frank ; no place to recover from a failed engagement . She turns and walks toward her bedroom
FRANK: What what did I do ?
CARA: Nothing . I 'm sorry .
WAITER: Pardone Signore . Good morning .
FRANK: When she ?
FRANK: Goddamn it ! I 'm a fucking tourist !
BURLY WELSHMAN: Are ya bloody mad ?
FRANK: Shit
A GONDOLIER: Run faster , man !
DOMENICO: You ca n't let them stay over , man . You start cuddling and then she wants to borrow your car . Stop cuddling , Tomaso ! Frank stands .
FRANK: Excuse me
DOMENICO: Hey , what are you doing in here ?
FRANK: The officers told me to wait here . I 've been sitting here for ove two hours Dominico glances over his shoulder .
DOMENICO: I think they forgot about you .
FRANK: Somebody tried to kill me .
DOMENICO: Mr. Taylor , wow , you had quite a day . Eh ? We got chasing , we got shooting .
FRANK: You think I 'm crazy but it 's all true .
DOMENICO: Maybe you crazy AND it 's true , my friend .
FRANK: I have absolutely no idea .
DOMENICO: They followed you from the Danieli ?
FRANK: They came to the room . They pretended to be room service .
DOMENICO: You do n't scopata one of thei girlfriends or something ?
FRANK: I did n't `` scopata '' anybody !
DOMENICO: Who is He consults a piece of paper .
FRANK: In America the cops catch the crooks , not the victim .
DOMENICO: Ha ha , we do that sometimes here , too . Domenico considers for a moment .
FRANK: No .
DOMENICO: How long you know Cara Mason ?
FRANK: I met her yesterday .
DOMENICO: And you take her to the Danieli ? That must have been good meeting , yes ?
FRANK: I did n't take her . She took me .
DOMENICO: You lead an exciting life , Mr. Taylor .
FRANK: Not usually .
DOMENICO: Signora Mason was staying with `` her husband '' last night . You marry her , Mr. Taylor ?
FRANK: No .
DOMENICO: I think maybe Signora Mason might know why these guys behave badly . What do you think ? Pause .
FRANK: I think that 's possible .
DOMENICO: You got a phone number , mobile ?
FRANK: She did n't give me one .
DOMENICO: You need some clothes . I 'll be ight back . He leaves Frank alone again .
FRANK: Um thanks . Where are we going ?
DOMENICO: I 'm taking you to the hospital , Mr. Taylor . A doctor should take a look at you .
FRANK: I 'd really rather just go
DOMENICO: Do n't worry . I put you in Padua , away from Venice . You 'll be safe . Any worry , you call me . I give you my home number .
NURSE: Relax signore . We 're just going to make sure everything is all ight inside your head .
CLERK: Unfortunately we 've already re-let the room . We 'd rather the guests did n't know about the incident .
DOMENICO: Do n't worry . I 'll be discreet .
CLERK: Grazie .
DEMIDOV: Of course . Demidov steps back , holding the door open .
DOMENICO: That 's what I 'm trying to find out , Signore .
DEMIDOV: You are a good detective .
DOMENICO: I do my best . Domenico stands and takes his leave .
ACKERMAN: What did we find on the American ?
JONES: He 's a tourist . Member of the teacher 's union . Pays his taxes . Has bad luck .
ACKERMAN: Evidently . He had a pair of Russian hit men after him . Are you still going to tell me Demidov is clean ?
JONES: I never said he is clean . I just said he is n't our target .
GOYAL: I 'm just wondering how they tracked them down at the hotel
ACKERMAN: Just so long as they do n't beat us to Pearce when the real one arrives . He looks up at Goyal .
GOYAL: The local police picked him up .
ACKERMAN: Then he 's safely out of the way .
FRANK: Hello ?
DOMENICO: Well it 's official Mr. Taylor . You 're not mad .
FRANK: That 's a relief .
DOMENICO: I went to the hotel . Somebody shot at somebody . I found a shell casing . I 'll have it analyzed in the morning . Frank glances around uncomfortably .
FRANK: I 'd like to be on a flight home tomorrow morning .
DOMENICO: Relax , you 're perfectly safe where you are . You have any visits from you Signora Mason ?
FRANK: I wish .
DOMENICO: Never let them cuddle , Mr. Taylor . One cuddle and it all turns to merda . Good night . If you need anything , you have my number . Frank hangs up , shaking his head .
FRANK: Wrong floor .
CARA: What are you waiting for ? Get in .
FRANK: A little . He glances anxiously over her shoulder .
CARA: I know .
FRANK: Do you know why ?
CARA: It 's because I kissed you .
FRANK: That guy has nothing to do with this .
CARA: Neither do you .
FRANK: There 's not enough room !
CARA: There 's enough room .
FRANK: We wo n't make it !
CARA: I thought Americans were optimists .
FRANK: Do I look that much like Alexande Pearce ? Cara turns sharply .
CARA: How do you know ? Frank holds up his wrist .
FRANK: The watch . She hesitates . A pause .
CARA: I do n't know . You 're about his size . That 's all .
FRANK: You do n't know what your own oyfriend looks like ?
CARA: Alexander crossed a very dangerous man . He changed his appearance in order to vanish .
FRANK: Great .
CARA: Do n't worry . I 'm taking you somewhere you 'll be safe .
FRANK: We should go to the police .
CARA: Because they did such a good jo protecting you before ? Frank does n't respond .
FRANK: And I thought I would n't get to do any sight-seeing . Frank steps over a greenish puddle .
CARA: Here we are . She pauses before a run-down palazzo .
FRANK: Whoa !
CARA: Sorry .
FRANK: What are you doing ? She pulls out , a flashlight in her mouth .
CARA: Making sure no one sabotaged the gas lines .
FRANK: He goes Barracuda fishing ? Cara has poured herself a glass of wine .
CARA: He goes Marlin fishing . You catch the Barracudas by accident .
FRANK: With these ingredients , it 's not hard . Frank savors a bite of his meal .
CARA: I 'm glad I decided to come back for you , Frank Taylor .
FRANK: Can I ask you a question . She sets down her fork . Leans back .
CARA: I 'm not a criminal .
FRANK: You carry a gun , you consort with people being chased by killers I hate to break it to you , but
CARA: Okay , I 'm a criminal .
FRANK: For Alexander Pearce ? She does n't answer . Which is an answer .
CARA: He 's the most interesting man I 've ever known . When I first met him , I was n't expecting that . He took me by surprise .
FRANK: I do n't regret it , you know .
CARA: Regret what ?
FRANK: Kissing you .
CARA: What are you doing ? He looks up at her , questioningly .
FRANK: I thought
CARA: You thought what ? That I saw you on the train and my heart stopped ? That all my life I 've been waiting for a math teacher from the Midwest to sweep me off my feet ? Frank does n't respond .
THE ENGLISHMAN: Have you been reading the newspaper ?
CARA: Yes there was nothing there today . Is is it you ? Alexa
THE ENGLISHMAN: No names . Not on the phone .
ACKERMAN: Place him . Place him ! A HORN-RIMMED AIDE zeroes in on a MAP screen .
CARA: Do we really need anothe `` recipe ? ''
THE ENGLISHMAN: I want to make sure our guests are surprised .
ACKERMAN: Go ! Go ! Go !
CARA: That 's because you leave everything up to me . She pouts , only partially joking .
THE ENGLISHMAN: My only concern is for those who cross you , my love .
CARA: You have a talent for saying the ight thing . You always did .
GOYAL: We should check for prints . Maybe he forgot to wipe it down
ACKERMAN: I doubt it . Ackerman looks around .
CARA: Frank I have to go . He opens his eyes and looks at her .
FRANK: Resolved ?
CARA: It will all be over . I 'll give you the all clear and you can go ack to your life . This will be a great adventure you can look back on .
FRANK: When will I see you again ?
CARA: Never .
FRANK: Is he worth it ?
CARA: Get back inside . She has stopped mid-flight .
FRANK: You 're going to risk everything for him . Would he do the same fo you ? She is quite straightforward in her response .
CARA: It does n't matter . I love him .
FRANK: He does n't deserve it . She shakes her head .
CARA: None of this is your business anymore . Now get back inside Frank !
OLD MAN: Signorina .
CARA: Mi dispiace , Signor .
ACKERMAN: Why do women find these con men so appealing ? Jones is the only woman nearby
JONES: Do n't look at me . I married my personal trainer . She 's twenty-six . Jean Luc ca n't tell if she 's serious .
ACKERMAN: How did Pearce seduce that eautiful woman ? Was it his charm ? His looks ?
GOYAL: Looks change .
ACKERMAN: Maybe it 's because if he adores himself and spends every moment gratifying his desires , so then can she .
GOYAL: She 's on the move . Time to go . Ackerman pushes himself wearily to his feet .
ACKERMAN: By all means . Let 's follow the children .
DEMIDOV: When I was a young man , times were very hard . When an opportunity presented itself , you took it .
ACKERMAN: You know what we know .
FRANK: Time for Alexander and me to meet face to face .
CARA: I do n't know what you 're talking about . Please go , I 'd like to have a quiet coffee .
ACKERMAN: Move off . Move off .
FRANK: Caffe , per favore ? Frank turns back to Cara , who calls out
CARA: Cameriere ! No caffe for signor !
FRANK: With milk ! She stares at him .
CARA: Do you want to be dead ?
FRANK: Not particularly , but I 'm tired of eing afraid . I 've been running around like a frightened mouse long enough and I 've decided I 'm finished .
GOYAL: He 's not going anywhere .
ACKERMAN: Put Lipetti in . Tell him to play it like he 's dealing with a rowdy guest escort him out .
CARA: Frank , you have no idea what you 're sticking your nose into .
FRANK: Probably not . But I 'm doing it anyway . Alexander Pearce nearly got me killed . It was his idea , ight ?
CARA: Wonderful . Another macho idiot . Conto , per favore ! Frank leans in .
FRANK: What 's the lure , Cara ? Obviously not his character . Is it the money ? The luxury ? What 's any of that worth if you 're getting shot at and you could go to jail ?
CARA: I 'm leaving Frank .
FRANK: He 's smooth , right ? He probably has mistresses in every European city , too .
CARA: It 's really a shame you 've scared him off She tosses some Euros on the table .
FRANK: What the hell ? As Frank looks up .
CARA: Frank !
ACKERMAN: Abort ! Abort , goddammit !
FRANK: You hide out poolside and send your girlfriend and a total stranger to face the murderers who are after you ? Not much of a tough guy , are you ? Frank SHOVES him back .
ACKERMAN: That goddamn fool .
GOYAL: What do we do with him ?
ACKERMAN: Throw him in the lagoon .
FRANK: Cara !
AGENT: Ok Signor you can come with us now .
ACKERMAN: Please He looks Frank up and down .
FRANK: It 's borrowed .
ACKERMAN: It 's a good fit .
FRANK: Unfortunately .
ACKERMAN: You have a vivid imagination .
FRANK: I have n't needed it lately . Ackerman smiles .
ACKERMAN: I know that . Frank looks up .
FRANK: Since when ?
ACKERMAN: Since the beginning . Frank stares at him blankly
FRANK: How ?
ACKERMAN: Come . I want to show you something Frank .
FRANK: You ?
ACKERMAN: Take a look at the second row . INSERT CLOSE UP on the screen .
FRANK: Cara He is dumbfounded .
ACKERMAN: We 've been watching you this entire time .
FRANK: You saw those men try to kill me and you did n't intervene ?
ACKERMAN: I 'm trying to apprehend a majo criminal . I 'm not a babysitter . Frank grows angry .
FRANK: I want to speak with somebody at the American Embassy . I 'm going to tell them that you and you undercover officer knowingly and ecklessly endangered the life of an American citizen ! Let 's see what my government has to say about that !
JONES: We 're aware of the situation , Mr. Taylor . But we take a long view of these things fortunately you are unhurt Frank is incredulous .
FRANK: Then I 'll go to the press . I 'll tell the entire story to the New York Times .
ACKERMAN: No . I do n't think you 'll do that .
FRANK: Why not ?
ACKERMAN: Because I do n't think you want to see Cara 's entire caree destroyed .
FRANK: In my case , they do n't come along at all .
ACKERMAN: She 's the worst combination stunning looks and a brilliant mind .
FRANK: If she 's so smart , how did she get caught up with Pearce ?
ACKERMAN: It started out as a straightforward placement
FRANK: Then why are you still using her ?
ACKERMAN: She 's all I have , Mr. Taylor . Beat .
FRANK: You think she 'll turn him in this time ?
ACKERMAN: I do n't know .
FRANK: It 's not just me , is it ?
CARA: Have you got him ?
ACKERMAN: You mean the idiot who ruined ou operation ?
CARA: Have you got him ? Ackerman glances out the window at Frank .
ACKERMAN: Yes . Cara is relieved .
CARA: It 's your own fault . We neve should have endangered a civilian . You should have put an agent into place .
ACKERMAN: There was no time . Besides Pearce is too smart for that ; he would have spotted the agent a mile away .
CARA: He did n't spot me . Ackerman smiles bitterly .
ACKERMAN: Apparently he did n't have to .
CARA: What makes you think he did n't ? Ackerman 's face lights up
ACKERMAN: Okay everybody , listen up .
JONES: Pearce 's own villa ? Why would he isk going back there ? He must know we 'd be watching .
JEAN LUC: Perhaps he 's nostalgic .
ACKERMAN: I doubt that . Maybe there 's something of value still there . He left in a hurry after all .
JONES: Call in a search team .
ACKERMAN: We searched the place after the aid last year . If there 's anything hidden there , only Pearce knows where it is . He picks up his coat .
FRANK: If you 're all around his house , will he show up ? A dozen heads turn to look at him .
ACKERMAN: If I needed your advice Mr. Taylor , I 'd ask . Frank shrinks down in his chair .
CARA: Come in .
FRANK: I 'm sorry .
CARA: It 's okay . Come over here . I need your help .
FRANK: Ackerman told me everything . She takes a deep breath .
CARA: I 'm sorry Frank .
FRANK: There 's no apology necessary .
CARA: How do I look ?
FRANK: Like the most beautiful woman on earth .
CARA: When will you go home ?
FRANK: Ackerman asked me to stay with the surveillance team in case the thugs who came after me at the Danieli show up . I 'm the only one who can identify them . Something occurs to Frank .
CARA: I told him to make sure you were safe until this was over . He nods . A little pleased at her concern .
FRANK: You should n't worry about me . What about you ?
CARA: What about me ?
FRANK: What are you going to do ? She takes a beat , then puts her game face on .
CARA: My job .
FRANK: You all read the same newspaper .
ACKERMAN: It 's a good paper . And sold throughout the world . Makes the classified ads especially useful
FRANK: I look forward to meeting him .
ACKERMAN: So do I .
AGENT: You 'll have to turn around , sir . There 's been a chemical spill in this area
FRANK: Who 's that ?
ACKERMAN: What happened ? Get it back on line !
JONES: Was that Pearce ?
GOYAL: How did he know there would be a camera ?
JONES: He 's taking out the entire surveillance system
ACKERMAN: Stop him .
TECHNICIAN: I ca n't ! He 's cutting the feed at the source .
JEAN LUC: How can one man move through the house that fast ?
GOYAL: What should we do ?
ACKERMAN: Shut up ! Everyone .
DEMIDOV: Sorry to disappoint you , my dear . He steps toward her . Cara pales .
JONES: Who is that ?
JEAN LUC: The accent is Russ
ACKERMAN: Shh ! It 's Ivan Demidov . Jones looks at him .
JONES: Not possible .
DEMIDOV: You 're waiting for someone , Ms. Mason ? Cara does n't reply .
GOYAL: What are we going to do ?
ACKERMAN: We 're going to wait for Alexande Pearce . Just like them .
SNIPER: She 's brought them to the window
DEMIDOV: Not very polite of your boyfriend to keep you waiting .
CARA: He loses track of time easily .
DEMIDOV: I have a hard time believing that . Perhaps he 's already here somewhere hiding even watching us .
GOYAL: Sir ?
ACKERMAN: Demidov 's right . He 's here somewhere Another SLAP . Another scream .
JEAN LUC: We have to do something
ACKERMAN: We have to wait .
JEAN LUC: Yes but
ACKERMAN: She 's my agent . She 's my esponsibility .
JONES: What if he does n't come ? Ackerman does n't respond .
GOYAL: Where 's Taylor ?
DEMIDOV: Good news . He loves you .
CARA: That 's not Alexander Pearce . Demidov ignores her and walks up to Frank .
DEMIDOV: You know , Mr. Pearce , I thought I was finished with this sort of thing . But in your case , I 've een forced to make an exception .
CARA: He is NOT Alexander Pearce !
FRANK: Nothing to be sorry for .
DEMIDOV: Good bye Mr. Pearce .
CARA: Ackerman !
ACKERMAN: Do it .
FRANK: Are you all right ?
CARA: I did well to choose you on the train
FRANK: You did n't get to arrest Alexande Pearce
CARA: He never showed up .
FRANK: You 're wrong . I 'm here . She straightens up . Her heart skips a beat .
CARA: Why ?
FRANK: You said I 'd told so many lies , you would n't believe me even if I did tell the truth This was the only way to convince you . The truth is that I love you . All that matters is that you believe me .
ACKERMAN: Cara I want the paramedics to make sure you 're all right
CARA: No we wo n't . There 's nothing to talk about . I do n't work for you anymore .
ACKERMAN: Mr. Taylor you 're free to go .
FRANK: It seems you did , Mr. Ackerman .
GOYAL: Sir over here . Take a look at this !
ACKERMAN: He was here .
GOYAL: Account numbers access codes unless I 'm mistaken he left the money behind .
JEAN LUC: A mistake perhaps ?
JONES: How much is there ? Goyal scans down to a total
GOYAL: Looks like 744 million .
JONES: That 's no mistake That 's his tax bill .
ACKERMAN: Oh but I did get my man , Ms. Jones . She realizes ; he was after Demidov all along . Ackerman nods to Goyal , a twinkle in his eye .
JONES: There 's something I do n't understand how did Pearce manage to get here and open that safe without anybody noticing ? And where did he go ?
ACKERMAN: Because Pearce was cleverer than all of us .
THE ENGLISHMAN: $ 20 million dollars worth of surgery and that 's the face you chose ?
FRANK: It 's good to see you too .
CARA: You really think they 'll just give up ?
FRANK: The Americans have their money . I left it all for them .
CARA: What about Demidov 's money ?
FRANK: Well You have to save something fo your pension .

REX: Woody ? Who 's up there with you ?
SLINKY: Woody , what are you doing under the ed ?
WOODY: Uh-h-h-hnothing ! Uh , nothing . I 'm sure Andy was just a little excited , that 's all . Too much cake and ice cream , I suppose . It 's just a mistake .
REX: Have you been replaced ?
WOODY: Hey ! What did I tell you earlier ? No one is getting replaced . The toys give each other a look of doubt .
BUZZ: Buzz Lightyear to Star Command . Come in , Star Command . Nothing . He pushes the button again .
WOODY: Hello-o-o
BUZZ: HO-YAAAHH ! ! !
WOODY: Aaaaaaah ! Whoa , hey , whoa , did I frighten you ? Did n't mean to . Sorry . Howdy ! My name is Woody and this is Andy 's room . That 's all I wanted to say , and also , there has been a bit of a mix-up . This is my spot , see , the bed here

WOODY: Yes , it is a mistake , because , you see , the bed , here , is my spot .
BUZZ: I need to repair my turbo boosters . Do you people still use fossil fuels , or have you discovered crystalic fusion ?
WOODY: Well , let 's see , we 've got double A 's
BUZZ: Watch yourself ! !
REX: Do n't shoot ! It 's okay ! Friends !
BUZZ: Do you know these life forms ?
WOODY: Yes . They 're Andy 's toys .
BUZZ: Alright , everyone . You 're clear to come up . Buzz walks over to the toys .
REX: Oh , I 'm so glad you 're not a dinosaur !
BUZZ: Why , thank you Now thank you all for your kind welcome .
REX: Say ! What 's that button do ?
BUZZ: I 'll show you . Buzz presses a button on his chest .
SLINKY: Hey , Woody 's got something like that . His is a pullstring , only it
HAMM: Oh yeah , but not like this one . This is a quality sound system . Probably all copper wiring , huh ? So , uh , where are you from ? Singapore ? Hong Kong ?
BUZZ: Wellno , actually I 'm stationed up in the Gamma Quadrant of Secto 4 . As a member of the elite Universe Protection Unit of the Space Ranger Corps , I protect the galaxy from the threat of invasion from the Evil Emperor Zurg , sworn enemy of the Galactic Alliance .
REX: And I 'm from Mattel . Well , I 'm not actually from Mattel , I 'm actually from a smaller company that was purchased in a leveraged buy-out . Well , I do n't really understand the financials , but Woody walks over to Bo Peep .
WOODY: You 'd think they 've never seen a new toy before .
BO PEEP: Well sure , look at him . He 's got more gadgets on him then a Swiss army knife .
BUZZ: Ah , ah , ah , please be careful ! You do n't want to be in the way when my laser goes off .
WOODY: It 's not a laser ! It 's a little lightbulb that blinks !
HAMM: What 's with him ?
WOODY: All right , that 's enough . Look , we 're all very impressed with Andy 's new toy
BUZZ: Toy ?
WOODY: T-O-Y . Toy .
BUZZ: Excuse me , I think the word you 're searching for is Space Ranger .
WOODY: The word I 'm searching for I ca n't say because there 's pre-school toys present .
REX: Oh , uh , Mr. Lightyear ? Now I 'm curious . What does a Space Range actually do ?
WOODY: He 's not a Space Ranger ! He does n't fight evil or shoot lasers or fly
BUZZ: Excuse me . Buzz calmly hits a button and wings pop out . Again the toys GASP IN AWE .
HAMM: Oh , impressive wingspan . Very good !
WOODY: Oh , what ? ! What ? ! These are plastic . He ca n't fly !
BUZZ: They are a terillium-carbonic alloy and I CAN fly .
WOODY: No , you ca n't .
BUZZ: Yes , I can .
WOODY: You ca n't !
BUZZ: Can !
WOODY: Ca n't ! Ca n't ! Ca n't !
BUZZ: I tell you , I could fly around this oom with my eyes closed !
WOODY: Okay then , Mr. Lightbeer ! Prove it .
BUZZ: All right , then , I will . Stand back everyone !
REX: Whoa ! Oh , wow ! You flew magnificently !
BO PEEP: I found my moving buddy !
BUZZ: Why , thank you . Thank you all . Thank you .
WOODY: That was n't flying ! That was falling with style !
SLINKY: Heh , heh , heh ! Golly bob howdy
WOODY: Oh , shut up ! In a couple of days , everything will be just the way it was . They 'll see they 'll see . I 'm still Andy 's favorite toy .
ANDY: Buzz Lightyear to the rescue .
WOODY: Finally !
SHARK: Look , I 'm Woody . Howdy , howdy , howdy !
WOODY: Ah-hah ! Ah-hah-hah ! Give me that ! Woody leaps out of the toy box .
BUZZ: Your Chief , Andy , inscribed his name on me .
REX: With permanent ink , too !
BUZZ: Well , I must get back to repairing my ship . Buzz walks away .
WOODY: Uh , let what ? I do n't Uh , what do you mean ? Who ?
BO PEEP: I know Andy 's excited about Buzz , ut you know , he 'll always have a special place for you .
WOODY: Alright ! That 's it ! Woody angrily marches across the room .
BUZZ: Unidirectional bonding strip .
ROBOT: Mr. Lightyear wants more tape !
WOODY: Listen , Lightsnack , you stay away from Andy . He 's mine , and no one is taking him away from me .
BUZZ: What are you talking about ? Where 's that bonding strip ? !
WOODY: And another thing . Stop with this spaceman thing . It 's getting on my nerves .
BUZZ: Are you saying you want to lodge a complaint with Star Command ?
WOODY: Oh okay , so you want to do it the hard way , huh ? Buzz stands up , face to face with Woody .
BUZZ: Do n't even think about it , cowboy !
WOODY: Oh , yeah , tough guy ? !
BUZZ: The air is n't toxic .
WOODY: You actually think you 're THE `` Buzz Lightyear ? '' Oh , all this time I thought it was an act ! Hey , guys ! Look ! It 's the REAL Buzz Lightyear !
BUZZ: You 're mocking me , are n't you ?
WOODY: Oh , no , no , no Buzz , look ! An alien !
BUZZ: Where ? Buzz falls for the trick and turns around . Woody kneels over with LAUGHTER .
WOODY: Uh-oh . Slinky hides under the bed .
SLINKY: It 's Sid !
REX: I thought he was at summer camp !
HAMM: They must have kicked him out early this year . The toys rush over to the window .
REX: Oh , no ! Not Sid !
WOODY: I ca n't tell . Hey , where 's Lenny ?
REX: Oh , no . I ca n't bear to watch one of these again !
WOODY: Oh , noit 's a Combat Carl .
BUZZ: What 's going on ?
WOODY: Nothing that concerns you spacemen . Just us TOYS .
BUZZ: I 'd better take a look anyway .
WOODY: That 's why . Sid .
BUZZ: Sure is a hairy fellah .
WOODY: No ! No , that 's Scud , you idiot ! Again , Woody readjusts Buzz 's view .
BUZZ: You mean that happy child ?
REX: He tortures toys just for fun .
BUZZ: Well , then we 've got to do something !
BO PEEP: What are you doing ? ! ! Get down from there !
BUZZ: I 'm going to go teach that boy a lesson .
WOODY: Yeah , sure . You go ahead . Melt him with your scary laser .
BUZZ: Be careful with that , it 's extremely dangerous .
LENNY: He 's lighting it ! He 's lighting it !
BUZZ: I could have stopped him .
WOODY: Buzz , I would love to see you try . 'Course I 'd love to see you as a crater . Sid CACKLES and dances around the crater .
BO PEEP: The sooner we move the better .
ANDY: To infinity and beyond !
MRS. DAVIS: Oh , all this packing makes me hungry . What would you say to dinner at , uh , oh , Pizza Planet ?
ANDY: Pizza Planet ? ! Oh , cool !
MRS. DAVIS: Go wash your hands and I 'll get Molly ready .
WOODY: One toy ?
BUZZ: Trouble ? ! Where ? !
WOODY: Down there . Just down there . A helpless toyit'sit 's trapped , Buzz !
BUZZ: Then we 've no time to lose ! !
WOODY: Oh , he 's there . Just , just keep looking .
BUZZ: What kind of a toy ?
TOYS: BUZZ ! ! ! !
WOODY: Buzz ! ! !
SLINKY: I do n't see him in the driveway ! I think he bounced into Sid 's yard .
REX: Buzz !
RC CAR: Whirrr ! ! Whirrrr-whirrrr ! ! !
REX: Hey everyone ! RC 's trying to say something ! The toys turn from the window to RC .
RC CAR: Whirrr ! ! ! Whirrr ! Whirrrrrr ! !
TOYS: Huh ?
BO PEEP: What do you mean ?
TOYS: WHAT ? ! ?
WOODY: Wait a minute . You you do n't think I meant to knock Buzz out the window , do you Potato Head ?
SLINKY: We believe you , Woody . Right , Rex ?
REX: Oh , I do n't like confrontations .
SARGENT: Where is your honor , dirtbag ? ! You are an absolute disgrace ! You do n't deserve to Woody seals the lid back on the bucket . Potato Head starts closing in on Woody .
HAMM: I do n't think we should give him the chance .
SARGENT: There he is , men ! Frag him !
HAMM: I got dibs on his hat !
BO PEEP: Would you boys stop it ? !
HAMM: Tackle him !
WOODY: No , no , no , no ! Wait ! Wait I can explain everything
SARGENT: Retreat !
ANDY: Mom ! Do you know where Buzz is ?
MRS. DAVIS: Honey , I 'm sure he 's around . You 'll find him .
SLINKY: It 's too short ! We need more monkeys !
REX: There are n't any more ! That 's the whole barrel .
ANDY: Can I help pump the gas ?
MRS. DAVIS: Sure ! I 'll even let you drive .
WOODY: Oh , great . How am I gon na convince those guys it was an accident ?
BUZZ: I just want you to know that even though you tried to terminate me , evenge is not an idea we promote on my planet .
WOODY: Oh . Oh , that 's good .
BUZZ: But we 're not on my planet , are we ?
WOODY: No .
BUZZ: Buzz Lightyear Mission Log . The local Sheriff and I seem to be at a huge refueling station of some sort
WOODY: You !
BUZZ: According to my nava-computer , the
WOODY: Shut up ! Just shut up , you idiot ! !
BUZZ: Sheriff , this is no time to panic .
WOODY: This is the perfect time to panic ! I 'm lost , Andy is gone , they 're going to move from their house in two days and it 's all your fault ! !
BUZZ: My fault ? ! If you had n't pushed me out of the window in the first place

WOODY: Oh , Buzz , you 've had a big fall . You must not be thinking clearly .
BUZZ: No , Woody , for the first time I am thinking clearly . You were right all along . I 'm not a Space Ranger . I 'm just a toy . A stupid little insignificant toy .
WOODY: Whoa , hey wait a minute . Being a toy is a lot better than being a Space Ranger .

WOODY: No , it is . Look , over in that house is a kid who thinks you are the greatest , and it 's not because you 're a Space Ranger , pal , it 's ecause you 're a TOY ! You are HIS toy .
BUZZ: But why would Andy want me ?
WOODY: Why would Andy want you ? ! Look at you ! You 're a Buzz Lightyear . Any other toy would give up his moving parts just to be you . You 've got wings , you glow in the dark , you talk , your helmet does that that whoosh thing you are a COOL toy . Woody pauses and looks at himself .

BO PEEP: Merry Christmas , Sheriff .
WOODY: Say , is n't that mistletoe ?
BO PEEP: Mm-hmmmmm .
REX: Maybe Andy 'll get another dinosaur , like a leaf-eater . That way , I could play the , uh , dominant predator . Ha ha ha ! Slinky LAUGHS with Rex .

MR. RODMAN: This informant , paid by the police , using taxpayers dollars to continue his felony drug habit , was the link which allowed police to raid a private farm . A working farm . A farm where honest Americans make their living .
ROBERT: Mr. Rodmanit 's too bad your client did n't show as much sense in choosing what he planted as he did in choosing his attorney A polite chuckle from the justices
MR. RODMAN: I 'm sorry the court finds my argument epetitious .
ROBERT: Mr. Rodman , may I offer a piece of advice ? The next time you argue this point before this court , egardless of my whereabouts , I ecommend you have something up you sleeve other than your arm .
CLERK: What do you think it is ?
ROBERT: Depends who it 's from .
CLERK: Your friends at Warren , Putnam and Hudson .
ROBERT: You can learn a lot about somebody from this stuff . Three categories you like me , you hate me , you want something from me . Definitely third category .
CLERK: What would a law firm want from the new drug Czar ?
ROBERT: Depends on the state .
CLERK: Arizona .

CLERK: Maybe there 's a book in it . The clerk takes one of the glasses .
ROBERT: Not by me . They toast and drink .
JAVIER: I had that dream again . A long pause .
MANOLO: Which one ? Another long pause .
JAVIER: Where my mother 's suffocating .
DRIVER: Is there a problem ?

DRIVER: Okay . I see . How much do you want ?
JAVIER: Drop the package . Put your hands ehind your head . You 're unde arrest .
DRIVER: I do n't understand . I think there must be some mistake .
JAVIER: No , there 's no mistake .
SALAZAR: What 's your name ?
JAVIER: Javier Rodriguez .
SALAZAR: Well , Javier Rodriguez , you 've done a very good job , but we 'll take care of it from here .
JAVIER: An informant .
SALAZAR: What is the name of your informant ?
JAVIER: It was an anonymous tip . Salazar looks at Javi a beat .
SALAZAR: For a State Police officer , you 're very well informed . Let 's go .
MOMENTS LATER: Javi and Manolo watch the convoy of vehicles drive away . Javier lights a cigarette .
MANOLO: Was n't that General Salazar ?
JAVIER: Yeah .
MANOLO: What 's he doing up here ?
JAVIER: I do n't know . Something . They start for their car .
CASTRO: No telltales . Nothing to read . Not touching my face . Not even linking . No giveaways . How 're you feeling ?
GORDON: I feel good .
CASTRO: No more pissant basin league bullshit for us , hunh ?
GORDON: Nope .
CASTRO: Limbering up , gon na stay loose , keep it all together . Take this motherfucker down .
RUIZ: You ever buy a quarter ton ? Not many people have .
GORDON: Nobody said shit , Eduardo
RUIZ: Relax . We 're waiting , that 's it .
CASTRO: Hey , you want to hear a joke ? I got a joke . Why do women wear makeup and perfume ?
GORDON: Chill out
CASTRO: It 's a funny fuckin ' joke and it 's quick . Why do women wear makeup and perfume ?
RUIZ: I do n't know .
CASTRO: 'Cause they 're ugly and they stink . Castro laughs uproariously .
GORDON: Man , you never been close enough to a woman to know how she smells .
DEA AGENT: This is ridiculous this fucking thing . Look at this shit the first television transmission . I had bette shit when I was the AV guy at junio high , swear-to-God .
FBI AGENT: This is our show . Ah , man . I do n't want to share this one .
CASTRO: Agent down . Repeat , agent down .
CLOWN: Hey dudes , we 're not open yet .
RUIZ: Take me to the hospital . I 'm bleeding to death . Castro shoves him forward .
SETH: Father of Greek tragedy ? Anyone ? Okay , Aeschylus it is . His trilogy ? The Oresteia . I mean this is beautiful , can anyone stop the Seth Machine ? Score . Thank you . Madmax from Omaha we own you . And Tragedy is closed out .

CAROLINE: What are you doing ?
SETH: Just watch .
CAROLINE: What is this , like freebase ?
SETH: Not like . It is .
CAROLINE: More .
ROBERT: I 'll be sure to let you know .
SHERIDAN: I just want to be clear about one thing . I used to work for him , but now I work for you . I 'm not a partisan person , I 'm an issue person . In the next few weeks , if you allow me , we 'll get you well-versed on an incredible array of issues . The most important of which , in my opinion , being Mexico . I know everybody that you 're gon na meet . It 's important that they like you . It 's not important that they like me . That 's why I can help protect you .
ROBERT: Like you protected Landry ?
SHERIDAN: I see where you 're going with that , ut if I could just say something , which is basically that a guy like Landry is so autocratic he does n't know how to let himself be helped ; it 's a point of pride to take every ullet , no matter who fired it , o whether it was even aimed at him , which personally I think it very self-defeating . Now , do n't get me wrong , he 's a man of enormous integrity , but there 's a political component to this job that the General just did n't have any patience for .
GENERAL LANDRY: Jeff , you want to excuse us for a minute ? Sheridan nods and leaves .
ROBERT: You 've done a fine job here , Sir . The Office of National Drug Control Policy is in better shape than when you found it .
GENERAL LANDRY: I 'm not sure I made the slightest difference . I tried I really did .
ROBERT: There are a lot of encouraging statistics . The work 's just started , ut I intend to see it through . You 've got my word on that .
GENERAL LANDRY: You 're here for two years , three maximum . What 'd they promise you ? Court appointment ? What ? District ? Appeals ? Not Supreme Supreme ?
ROBERT: I 've come in to do a tough job and that 's what I 'm going to focus on . General Landry SIGHS .
GENERAL LANDRY: When Kruschev was forced out , he sat down and wrote two letters and handed them to his successor . He said `` When you get into a situation you ca n't get out of , open the first lette and you 'll be saved . And when you get into another situation you ca n't get out of , open the second . '' Soon enough this guy found himself in a tight place . So he opened the first letter . It said , `` Blame everything on me . '' So he blamed the old guy and it worked like a charm . He got into another situation he could n't get out of , so he opened the second letter , which read , `` Sit down and write two letters . ''
JAVIER: Relax . If they were going to kill us they would have done it in the desert .
MANOLO: They would n't do it in front of all these people . They 'd send someone later , when we 're alone . Manolo tenses , and throws open the window .
JAVIER: Even if that were true , they 're not going to come to your house where you 're waiting for them .
ANNA: He 's right . They 'll do it when you 're walking somewhere , make it look like street crime .
MANOLO: Shut your fucking mouth . Nobody 's talking to you .
JAVIER: If you want her to stay out of it , then stop telling her everything . You should learn how to keep a secret .
MANOLO: She 's nosy . She hears me on the telephone .
JAVIER: Anyway , I do n't think we 'll ever see them again . Everything 's back to normal .
TOURIST WOMAN: You 're a police officer . Are n't you going to take a report or something ? Do n't you want to know what kind of car it is ?
TOURIST MAN: It 's a Brown Ford Explorer
TOURIST WOMAN: It was right here . It 's been stolen . I want to file a report .
MANOLO: Please . Filing a report will not help you find your car .
JAVIER: The police wo n't find your car .
TOURIST WOMAN: But you 're the police .
JAVIER: Call this man , he 'll find your ca for you .
TOURIST MAN: I do n't get it
TOURIST WOMAN: How will this guy know who has ou car ?
JAVIER: The police will tell him . There 's a beat of confusion .
TOURIST MAN: Why will they tell him but they wo n't tell us ?
TOURIST WOMAN: Because we pay him , stupid . Right ? And he pays the police . And then our car appears .
JAVIER: Yes . Better than filling out forms , ight ?
NAN: Duck salad ?
HELENA: Mmm . Nan ca n't believe it .
NAN: Helena , you never order duck salad .

NAN: What I know is ducks , as cute as they are , were designed by God to be eaten .
HELENA: I 'll put this in the back .
DAVID: No
HELENA: All the professionals keep them in the trunk .
DAVID: Not Tiger Woods .
HELENA: Especially Tiger Woods . Actually , he keeps his on the ack seat .
LONNIE: Gates , Myrhvold , Bezos . I sell to all those guys . Why ? Because the technology to intrude has reached the masses . Your competitor , you ex-spouse , adversaries , stalkers , they 're at the local electronics store right now , and they 're gon na e intruding on you not only through your telephone , but your fax , cell phone , pager , cable TV , Musak , windows , walls , air conditioning ventilation , modem , and internet connection .
FRANCISCO: I want to intercept cell phone calls , digital and analog . And locate the source of the call . I need databasing capability , to cross-reference calls and numbers .
LONNIE: Your Cellular Secretary , friend across all the digital wireless spread spectrum . So , Francisco , what do you do ? You a PI ? Private security ? Francisco looks at Lonnie coldly .
FRANCISCO: Assassin .
LONNIE: Assassin , okay . Let 's get you started in surveillance .
PHARMACEUTICAL LOBBYIST: We in the legal drug business , and I mean Merck , Pfizer , the rest of my very powerful clients , realize this is n't a war with a traditional winne and loser , but an organism at wa with itself , whose weapons of mass destruction happen to be intoxicants . And if you want a body count look no further than alcohol which racks up 80,000 kills a year . Cocaine manages a measly 2,000 . Same for Heroin . But , the big daddy is Big Tobacco which kills 380,000 each year , which , y the way , is more people than have een killed by all the illegal drugs in the last century .
ROBERT: That 's very interesting . The lobbyist smiles . Robert sips his drink .
STAN: It 's time , Robert , to choke some honesty out of these rural legislators ; get'em to fess up that it 's pretty much Prisons or Casinos in terms of their choices for economic growth .
ETHAN: What 's the difference between Prozac and Ecstacy , you ask ? One 's a mattress and the other 's a trampoline . Molecules do n't have morality . Really , think about it some molecule changes the way a serotonin re-uptake inhibitor works , it 's not suddenly a ad molecule ; it 's just a molecule . My theory America has a real fea of short , intense experiences . Robert turns away
ROBERT: Like you .
ANOTHER ROOM: Robert at the bar getting anothe scotch . A secretive man , TIM , 40 's , nerdy , sidles up beside him and whispers furtively in his ear .
TIM: Chemicals ? Some say problems , others say solution . Imagine a cloud that when it rains prohibits the growth of poppies or takes the THC out of marijuana . Imagine a pill that eliminates any psychological craving , from Dilaudid to Dove Bars . Law enforcement has n't let science sit on the sidelines . Addiction is no more relevant than polio or the Black Plague .
ECONOMIST: You 're not battling traffickers o dealers , but a market , and the market contains a paradox if you arrest traffickers , you raise prices , and you also raise profits , which brings more traffickers into the business .
UNDERSECRETARY: Back in the real world , we 're talking about Mexico and not John Maynard Keynes . We will spend 18 billion dollars this year on this `` war , '' and the question on the table every yea is do we certify Mexico as an ally or not ?
RUSH PHILLIPS: You want to make a difference , hit the users . You do n't jeopardize ou financial markets by some hypocritical stance on drug consumption . We 're snorting it , why penalize Mexico fo supplying it ?
UNDERSECRETARY: Mexico , do n't talk to me about Mexico
ECONOMIST: It 's the stick of law enforcement that creates the carrot of huge profits That 's economic truth
RUSH PHILLIPS: Addicts do n't vote ; they do n't have PACs ; they do n't spend soft money , that 's political truth
UNDERSECRETARY: We 're locking them up and consumption is falling
ECONOMIST: The price of coke and heroin has dropped and purity has increased . All this law enforcement has achieved is kids can get better stuff , cheaper . In economic terms , you can forget it ; this is not a winnable war .
RUSH PHILLIPS: Christ , you want to decertify somebody , take Pakistan or Columbia . We do n't need them for anything .
ECONOMIST: If you manage to seize an inconceivable 50 percent of all drugs coming into this country , you 'll still raise the price of coke and heroin less than 3 percent which wo n't affect drug use at all .
RUSH PHILLIPS: Why are we calling this a war at all ? You do n't declare war on you own people . Addiction is a little worm that gnaws a house apart from the inside .
UNDERSECRETARY: We need Mexico for these reasons number one Defense ; two Trade ; three Tourism ; then , way on down the line , comes Drugs . The President knows this . Why 's he holding everybody 's feet to the fire ?
MICHAEL: Mr. Wakefield , there 's a situation that needs your attention right away .
RUSH PHILLIPS: One in sixteen Americans is of Mexican descent . Mexico our third largest trading partner
ROBERT: You 're looking pretty good for an old guy .
MICHAEL: My work keeps me young .
ROBERT: Which part , getting terrorists loose on bail or freeing convicted murderers on technicalities ?
MICHAEL: The worst serial killer in history - who ? Gacy - right ? Killed forty two people . Our government killed fifty thousand in Vietnam and lied about it every day .
ROBERT: Michael , you represent drug dealers , not civil libertarians .
MICHAEL: We kidnapped Noriega out of Panama . Is that covered in your Constitution ? Because it is n't in mine .
ROBERT: Noriega is a criminal .
MICHAEL: Noriega was head of a sovereign nation who made the mistake of doing business with the U.S. Government . So , no , I do n't have a problem waking up every day and fighting our government , fighting people like you , trying to keep this system a little bit honest .
ROBERT: Last I read your clients were chopping people up with chainsaws and delivering illegal narcotics into this country .
MICHAEL: I hope when you were on the bench , Judge Wakefield , you did n't handle the presumption of innocence in the same fashion .
ROBERT: If I ever return to the bench , Counselor Adler , I hope I have the pleasure of hearing your arguments .
GORDON: You planning on going somewhere , Eduardo ? You do n't like it here ? This is the best situation you 're going to have for a long , long time .
RUIZ: I am a legitimate business . Fishing oats . Tuna . Check it out . Tax ecords , everything
GORDON: Listen you motherfucker , you tried to kill me with a fucking cannon .
RUIZ: You ca n't visit me here . I want my lawyer .
GORDON: The amount of coke we got on you means capital punishment in some states .
CASTRO: Move 'em to Texas , fry 'em up .
GORDON: We got you on tape making the deal . We got you bragging about the quality . We got you bragging about you usiness . We got you .
RUIZ: It 's a death sentence . I 'll neve make it to the trial .
GORDON: We can protect you . Ruiz looks at them in disbelief .
CASTRO: Who do you work for ?
RUIZ: This is coercion .
GORDON: That 's a big word for a fisherman .
CASTRO: Who do you work for ? Gordon and Ruiz stare at each other .
RUIZ: I know another word Immunity .
DAVID: Daddy !
CARL: Hello . Hello .
HELENA: Hi .
CARL: What 's up ?
HELENA: Just watching you .
CARL: I got that . How was your day ?
HELENA: I keep feeling like I 'm forgetting something .
CARL: What is this ? What is going on ?
GORDON: Mr. Ayala ?
CARL: That 's right .
GORDON: You 're under arrest for violation of Federal Narcotics laws .
AIDE: Not you . You . Javi goes into the room .
SALAZAR: Javier Rodriguez . Twenty-nine years- old . Graduated from Montessori school . Five years as a beat cop in TJ . Three years with the State Police . Parents died four years ago in their apartment from carbon monoxide poisoning because they could not afford to fix their gas heater . Your sister works in a Maquiladora in Juarez , making designer blue-jeans . On the police force three years , you currently make 316 dollars a month .
JAVIER: If I can .
SALAZAR: I 'm trying to bust the Tijuana Cartel .
JAVIER: What is it you want me to do ?
SALAZAR: A small thing . Nothing really . Javier thinks about this .
JAVIER: Does this offer include my partner ?
SALAZAR: Only if he can be trusted .
JAVIER: He 'll do what I say .
SALAZAR: His name is Francisco Flores . He is a killer and gun smuggler for the Tijuana cartel . I need to speak with him . I need you to find him and bring him to me so that I can speak with him .
MANOLO: This is fucking crazy . Instead of killing us , he sends us on a suicide mission . Do you know who Frankie Flowers is ? He 's a psycho-cokehead- hitman . A faggot . He 's killed fucking who knows how many people . You 'd need half the force to get close to him . And you ca n't get their help because he lives in fucking San Diego .
JAVIER: Then I guess I 'm going by myself .
ROBERT: What 's it like ? Imagine you 're being accosted by a swarm of beggars in the heart of Calcutta , except the beggars are wearing $ 1500 suits and they do n't say `` please '' or `` thank you . ''
CAROLINE: What about legalizing everything ? Has anybody talked about that ?
ROBERT: Fine legalization . Okay , forgetting all of our international trade agreements , legalize everything today . The Government inserts itself into all drug transactions . The U.S. becomes a giant pharmacy . Ou orders are mobbed , lines of people from here to Europe wanting to smoke , snort and shoot themselves into oblivion .
BARBARA: Like a Grateful Dead Concert .
ROBERT: Drugs begin pouring out of America into every other country in the world . Canada is completely overwhelmed .
CAROLINE: What if every country legalized at the same time ?
ROBERT: Somehow , I do n't see that happening .
BARBARA: So you know we put the case before the arbitration panel , none of whom had any expertise . Superfund is just one of those words . People stop paying attention .
ROBERT: That 's frustrating .
BARBARA: It 's so frustrating .
CAROLINE: Did you meet the President ?
BARBARA: Honey , your father knows the President .
ROBERT: As it happens , the President of the United States , my new boss , the leade of the free world , has me penciled in for some `` face time '' .
CAROLINE: Will we get invited to the White House ?
ROBERT: I do n't know .
CAROLINE: How long 's the job ?
ROBERT: It 's a presidential appointment so until I quit or get fired .
BARBARA: Czar for life , just like a real czar .
CAROLINE: That makes mom the Czarina . I 'm a Czarette . Like Anastasia . Caroline thinks about this .
BARBARA: Caroline
CAROLINE: Sorry , but I mean , come on .
ARNIE: Helena , I 'm so sorry
HELENA: Arnie , thank God . Metzger sits , giving her a hug .
ARNIE: I understand . You 're upset . You want to know what 's going on . That 's good .
HELENA: Why are you talking like that ?
ARNIE: Listen to me carefully . First of all , Carl is n't here . DEA 's got him and they 'll hang on to him until arraignment , which will probably be tomorrow . So here you 're wasting your time . Are you with me ? He checks to see if this is registering .
HELENA: Arnie , this is crazy . He makes eye contact with her .
ARNIE: Got it ? Good . Do not discuss anything ove the telephone . Do not talk to the neighbors . Stay out of your yard .
HELENA: What is he being charged with ?
ARNIE: I do n't know , but under no circumstances would I talk about it here . I want you to go home and elax the best you can . Continue your life as if nothing has happened . That is very important .
HELENA: Arnie , I feel like Alice stepping through the looking glass .
ARNIE: That 's a very apt analogy , Helena . Now , go home and be with you children .
LATER: Javi is working on his second bee when he seems to recognize somebody .
SALAZAR: I 'm curious how you did this with such economy .
JAVIER: Everybody has a weakness .
CAROLINE: All I 'm saying , what I 'm saying , is it never seems like anybody eve says anything that matters to them , like we all look at each other and nod with responses we 've been trained to make , not real responses , just social conventions , phony , fake smiles , surface bullshit I mean , we 're all smart and do we have any idea what each other are like , really like ? Do I know what Seth 's afraid of , or Vanessa , or fucked-up Bowman ?
SETH: We act like we have all the answers and we 're totally invincible like our parents seem and their parents efore them and it 's fucking bullshit
CAROLINE: And Vanessa does n't think she 's pretty so she does all these weird fucking diets which is totally about self- esteem . And she 's beautiful . And that 's not even fair . Because listen to me . I 'm fucking lying ight now . This is exactly what I 'm talking about I 'm supposedly talking about you , making some big point about you , and it 's really about me . So I should talk about me , not you , not even the universal `` you '' Okay . Okay , I 'm worried I 'm not eally smart or that I 'm not nearly as smart as people think I am , o that my parents ' expectations have een way too high since I was five , I mean who knows they 're going to Harvard when they 're five , not that I 'm blaming them for anything because everything 's great , and I may not even get in , but we all feel this shit and we never acknowledge it and if we ca n't acknowledge it to the people we care the most about then who will we ever say it too and what kind of life will that be ?
SETH: We live our lives by these unspoken ules that are handed to us .
VANESSA: Let 's be different
CAROLINE: Is he breathing ? Bowman 's eyes have rolled back in his head .
SETH: What do we do ? Okay . Fucked-up Bowman 's turning blue . Doctor . We need a doctor .
VANESSA: Your dad 's a doctor . Call him
SETH: He 's a research doctor . You 're dad 's a doctor , too
VANESSA: What kind of research ?
SETH: Mapping the fucking pig genome . We 'll call your dad , he 's a neurosurgeon
VANESSA: It 's three a.m . I 'm not supposed to be here . I snuck out
CAROLINE: Are you kidding I 'm staying with you
SETH: He 's gon na fucking die right here on the kitchen floor
ANOTHER KID: He ca n't . My parents are in Barbados
SETH: Nobody has anything on them , right ?
TORTURER: We know Tijuana Cartel gunmen killed our chief of intelligence , Francisco . We know you killed police commanders in Tijuana and Mexico City . Why do you resist ?
FRANCISCO: My father is rich . He 'll pay you .
TORTURER: Not the correct answer , my friend .
STEWIE: This is fabulous , Helena . What a turnout .
HELENA: Thank you so much , but I had a lot of help .
NAN: It 's a turnout because it 's a spectacle . Can you imagine ?
ALEX: I 've met her husband , as nice as they come .
STEWIE: It teaches me a valuable lesson Apparently crime pays .
NAN: Silly , you knew that already .
TUXEDO: Hello . Thank you . Thank you all . I have the results of the silent auction
SOCIAL WORKER: How old are you ?
CAROLINE: Sixteen
SOCIAL WORKER: Live with your parents ?
CAROLINE: Yes .
SOCIAL WORKER: Parents still together ?
CAROLINE: Yes .
SOCIAL WORKER: Do you work ?
CAROLINE: I volunteer . I read to blind people . One day a week for two hours .
SOCIAL WORKER: In school ?
CAROLINE: Cincinnati Country Day .
SOCIAL WORKER: Private ?
CAROLINE: Yeah .
SOCIAL WORKER: How are your grades ?
CAROLINE: I 'm third in my class .
SOCIAL WORKER: What 's that mean ?
CAROLINE: I get A 's . All A 's .
SOCIAL WORKER: You do ? What else you do ?
CAROLINE: I 'm a National Merit Finalist . I 'm on the Hi-Q team and the Math team . I 'm in the Spanish Club . I 'm a Thespian . I 'm Vice-President of my class . I 'm on the volleyball team .
SOCIAL WORKER: You wan na tell me what you 're doing here , Caroline ?
BARBARA: Oh , honey . Are you all right ?
CAROLINE: Did you tell Dad ?
BARBARA: Not yet .
CAROLINE: Are you going to ?
BARBARA: I do n't know .
CAROLINE: Is this bad for him ?
BARBARA: What do you think ?
HELENA: I am on the board of my son 's school . I had a fundraiser for A.L.V . in my front yard . I have a right to know if my husband is a legitimate usinessman .
ARNIE: Of course he is . I 've known him fo twenty years and he does n't jaywalk
CASTRO: They 're whispering . I ca n't hea them , but I know it . I smell conspiracy . I feel the lie vibrating out of the home .
GORDON: She ai n't in on it .
CASTRO: I have dreams about this , actual dreams about busting the top people , the rich people , the white people .
GORDON: I 'm telling you , she does n't know shit .
CASTRO: She knows Arnie Metzger .
GORDON: So does half of San Diego .
CASTRO: You want to make a wager on this ?
HELENA: If all our assets are frozen and ou `` sales force '' has scattered How am I supposed to survive ? I 'm giving irth in three months . How do I get through this ?
ARNIE: You 're gon na get through it , but the first thing we do is get Michael Adler to represent Carl . We get Adler and we beat this thing .
HELENA: How much do I pay him ?
ARNIE: I suspect he 'll accept his payment in publicity .
ROBERT: Caroline ? How well did you know this boy who overdosed ? She looks up beseechingly .
CAROLINE: He did n't hang around us . He 's like one of those hippie kids . I 'm not part of that group . It was a party in all these rooms . His girlfriend who I barely know was completely hysterical He 's blue , he 's puking We did n't want to get in trouble , but what were we supposed to do ? I mean , what would you have done if you had been us ?
BARBARA: How well do you know this boy , Seth , who was driving ? You know the police have charged him with a DUI and possession of marijuana .
CAROLINE: He 's a friend . He 's also like the only one who was dealing with the situation . He 'd definitely had a few beers , but it 's not like he wanted to drive . We did n't know what else to do . It was n't my pot .
ROBERT: Okay , honey . We understand . You 're mother and I have to talk . Caroline is confused by this reaction .
BARBARA: Honey , we 'd like to talk alone . Caroline stands abruptly
CAROLINE: Like always .
ROBERT: I think she 's lying .
BARBARA: Me , too .
ROBERT: We 'll ground her , clip her wings a it . School and scheduled activities and that 's it until further notice . This has to be handled delicately . Dan Kelly , in the District Attorney 's office , will probably help us out , quietly . Christ , this could be embarrassing .
BARBARA: Honey , this is difficult , but we 've all had our moments . I tried
ROBERT: Stop . You experimented in college . I do n't want to hear about that .
BARBARA: Should we take the quotes off experiment and call it what it is ?
ROBERT: This is different .
BARBARA: Why ?
ROBERT: To begin with , she 's only sixteen years-old .
BARBARA: I think she has to find out fo herself , on her own . We have to allow her space
ROBERT: Space for what ? To O.D . like that other kid ? I will not send the message that this type of behavio is okay with her parents . Because it is n't . Correct ?
BARBARA: We do n't want to push her away . These are growing experiences .
ROBERT: How long have you known about this ? No response .
BARBARA: Six months . I found some marijuana , that 's all . And a little pipe about two inches long . I talked with her . She said her friends smoked pot and drank
ROBERT: Explain to me how you could think that I should n't know about this . Explain to me how this would n't be elevant to me . As a parent .
BARBARA: She asked me not to . He leaves the room .
SALAZAR: You watch and learn . I earn his trust . Then more pain . Then I appea with kindness . Within a week he will follow me around like a dog .
JAVIER: But will he be house-trained ?
SALAZAR: When he loves me like a father , he will never tell anyone he was here . He will freely give the names of his superiors . Then we get them and they too will give us names . And eventually somebody will get us to Juan Obregon and the cartel will fall . They enter the barracks .
GUARD: Yes , sir !
SALAZAR: We are n't barbarians .
GUARD: Yes , sir !
SALAZAR: Bring this man a change of good clothes . Has he eaten ?
GUARD: I do n't know , sir .
SALAZAR: You will dine with me from now on .
PROSECUTOR: This is a man who heads a large criminal organization with international contacts we can only egin to understand . Our case against him is very strong . He is not a flight risk . His flight is assured . The people ask that your honor denies ail .
ADLER: My client is no more a flight risk than your Honor or the able prosecutor . He is a pillar of his community , a family man with a wife and child in La Jolla , the community where he has made his home for ove twenty years . As our defense will quickly show , my client is guilty of nothing more than being a handy target for an admitted criminal . Therefore we ask that you release Carl Ayala on his own recognizance .
JUDGE: I 'm gon na deny bail .
REPORTER: Mrs. Ayala , were you aware you husband is the largest cocaine smuggler in America ?
ADLER: Alleged , people , alleged .
REPORTER #2: Mrs. Ayala is it true your husband has ordered a hit on Eduardo Ruiz ?
ADLER: Carl Ayala sits on the board of the Children 's Hospital . He is heavily involved with Adult Literacy . He has a small boy and another child on the way . If you spread this kind of innuendo , you can expect legal ecourse . Are we clear on this point ?
ROBERT: I appreciate you coming in so early .
A.D.A. KELLY: Judge Wakefield , it 's an honor to handle it for you . Consider it gone away . She 's a minor ; it probably would 've expunged on her 18th birthday anyway .
ROBERT: Still , this was a sensitive issue for me and I wanted to thank you personally .
A.D.A. KELLY: Like I said , open container , P.I. , Misdemeanor possession . Easy to make it disappear . For you , poof , it 's gone .
ROBERT: I do n't know what you mean .
A.D.A. KELLY: I mean , did you ask her ? What kind of drugs has she tried ? Robert is silent for a beat .
ROBERT: I I do n't really know .
A.D.A. KELLY: Is she in any kind of therapy professional help ?
ROBERT: No , of course not . She 's one of the top students at her school .
A.D.A. KELLY: Well , I hope it stays that way .
ROBERT: It 's Robert . Wipe your schedule clean for the next three days . I 'm tired of talking to experts who neve set foot outside the beltway . It 's time to see the front lines .
GORDON: You should see little Montel play . Little Montel is the next Maradona .
CASTRO: Maradona is a cokehead . Hand of God , my ass . We 're wasting our time here .
GORDON: He won . He was a winner . That others you .
CASTRO: Winners do n't do coke . Or have n't you been reading the bumper stickers ? Gordon looks at the monitor
GORDON: What do we have here ?
HELENA: David , come back here this minute . David !
DAVID: We 're playing !
STRANGE MAN: Yeah , this is fun .
HELENA: Please put down my son . The man holds David .
STRANGE MAN: Should n't let your kid wander off with strangers .
HELENA: Thank you . That 's a valuable lesson . David , come on .
STRANGE MAN: Mrs. Ayala This gets her attention
GORDON: Are you getting this on tape ?
CASTRO: I love my job . I love it . The next time I 'm having a bad day you got ta emind me of right now and I 'll get over it .
MANOLO: A group of us are going out tonight .
JAVIER: Who ?
MANOLO: Guzman , Tomas , Esteban
JAVIER: Your new friends .
MANOLO: Yeah . It should be fun . You wan na come ?
JAVIER: Not this time .
FRANCISCO: In my home I have B & W speakers . I ecently purchased a compact disc urner . I can make my own cd 's , with whatever music I like , as if I ought them at the store , only I do n't have to pay these crazy prices .
SALAZAR: We have much in common . We both attended school in the United States , and both of our fathers are engineers .
FRANCISCO: I got into stereo equipment when I was a kid . Some people do n't notice the difference but it is very important to me .
SALAZAR: Of course it is . Have some more wine .
FRANCISCO: I ca n't go home . I do n't want to go . Please do n't make me . He looks beseechingly at them .
JAVIER: It 's not our decision .
FRANCISCO: I 'll be killed .
JAVIER: Stop complaining . Nobody knows what you 've been up to . They push him out of the SUV .
RUIZ: Carlos , I mean Carl , started out in the family connection business real estate in Tijuana , fishing boats out of Ensenada , hydroponic raspberries . He met up with the Obregon brothers of the Tijuana Cartel who were interested in two things entering society and using his fishing boats .
GORDON: So you pay off our customs officials ?
RUIZ: In Mexico law enforcement is an entrepreneurial activity , this is not so true for the USA . Using regression analysis we made a study of the customs lanes at the order and calculated the odds of a search . The odds are not high , and we found variables that reduce the odds . We hire drivers with nothing to lose . Then we throw a lot of product at the problem . Some get stopped . Enough get through . It 's not difficult .
CASTRO: You 'd think he was n't sitting here facing life in prison .
RUIZ: This has worked for years and it will continue to work for years . NAFTA makes everything more difficult for you . The border is disappearing . You people are like those Japanese soldiers left behind on deserted islands who think that World War II is still going on . Let me be the first to tell you , your government surrendered this wa a long time ago .
GORDON: This attitude 's not gon na help him any , is it ?
RUIZ: I got greedy . I decided to bring a little in on my own and somebody tipped you off . That was my mistake . Carl would never be so stupid .
GORDON: He hired you . That was a mistake .
RUIZ: Carl and I were friends from childhood . He was loyal , that 's not a mistake .
OFFICIAL: The busiest land border crossing in the world . Over forty-one thousand vehicles per day , twenty-two thousand pedestrians on foot . I think we do a pretty good job but we know a lot of drugs are still getting through .
ROBERT: Any idea how much ?
OFFICIAL: I 've read official estimates but I would n't bet my house on them . I 've heard the entire cocaine supply fo the United States can fit into fou tractor-trailers . At least a half-dozen of those cars ight out there are carrying a load of dope , with drivers employed by people who do n't give a damn if they 're caught or not .
ROBERT: What do you look for ?
OFFICIAL: We ask questions and measure the answers . When something does n't ing true , a fact that does n't make sense , a slight hesitation , then it 's off to secondary for a close look . Before NAFTA we had about 1.9 million trucks a year . Now it 's almost double . Pretty soon there 'll e Mexican truck companies that will have as much freedom in crossing the order as American truck companies .
ROBERT: Any way we can do it better ?
OFFICIAL: Sure . More money in intelligence on their side of the border . So we have a better idea who we 're looking for . More dogs . More people . Supposed to be getting some giant x- ay machines to run the trucks through . Outside of martial law that 's about the best you 're gon na do . But , I should tell you , there are two things that really have us on edge right now . In the last six months seizures have tripled , even though we 're pulling over the same number of cars . What does that tell you ?
ROBERT: That triple the amount of stuff is going through .
OFFICIAL: Right . But , that 's not the biggest problem . One of our Intel officers picked up information from DEA that traffickers have come up with a process , a chemical process , to turn coke into something else . It does n't smell like coke . It does n't look like coke . And what 's worse , it does n't react to field test . It could be anything . Maybe it 's already happening . I mean , how would we know ?
HELENA: Yes , hi Jenny , account number 4168 2245 3173 I need a cash advance .
GORDON: What do we do ?
CASTRO: I do n't know . There 's a KNOCKING at the door of the van .
GORDON: What do you think she wants ?
CASTRO: She 's your girlfriend . Open it , talk about your kids .
HELENA: I so hope I did n't startle you . I thought you might like some cold lemonade .
GORDON: Uh Thank you .
HELENA: I know this is a difficult situation and you 're only doing your jobs . I do n't bear you any ill-will , but I do have a small favor to ask .
CASTRO: You want to ask us a favor ?
HELENA: A man threatened my children . These charges have attracted a lot of attention and it seems to be inging all the nut-jobs out of the nut jar . Would you keep an eye out for anything out of the ordinary . I do n't know what else to do .
GORDON: Of course , we will .
HELENA: Thank you .
CASTRO: It 's probably poisoned . Gordon takes a big sip of his .
GORDON: It 's good . Not too sweet .
JAVIER: Anna . What 's wrong ? What do you want ?
ANNA: I ca n't find Manolo .
JAVIER: He 's not here .
ANNA: He never came home last night . Was he with you ?
JAVIER: No . He lets her into the apartment .
ANNA: I 'm worried . Last time he was out late , I went through his clothes while he was asleep .
JAVIER: I 'll find him .
MANOLO: It 's no problem . I was just with everybody we work with .
JAVIER: Oh , really . General Salazar was there ?
MANOLO: No , but a lot of other people . You should come . You should come out with us .
JAVIER: Go home . Get cleaned up . Get to work . Salazar is heading down to Mexico City next week and I 'm not getting left behind . Do n't fuck this up .
HUGHES: The word going around is you 're not that happy in your work . Maybe we can help .
SETH: You know my dad takes eight red cold pills every day ? He and my mom have cocktail hour every night , from six to seven , set your clock , two bourbons
CAROLINE: Maybe we could show up and smoke a little rock with them to unwind
SETH: Yeah , then some dope to take the edge off at the end of a long day .
CAROLINE: Have you done your homework , honey ?
SETH: Yes , mom
CAROLINE: Then here 's a little bump .
SETH: Drugs were n't even a problem until a hundred years ago when the white men in power declared them a problem . Opiates . But , who was using 'em ? Chinese immigrants . Slave labor . And the darkies up in the inner cities dancing to them evil rhythms of ju- ju music . People on the fringe . Artists . Decadent rich people . And who got scared ? White men in power . Who 's scared today ? White men in power . If J.P. Morgan and John D. Rockefeller ever admitted using , it 'd be a whole different story .
STREET DEALER: What you want ?
SETH: 911 , and the come down .
STREET DEALER: How much ?
SETH: Two hundred of C , hundred of the other .
CAROLINE: Come on We 've been here before .
STREET DEALER: Then , let 's see your money .
JUNKIE: What are you two , about twelve ?
CAROLINE: Fuck off .
SETH: Caroline , give me your money .
SKETCH: Goodbye Caroline .
SETH: Yeah , right .
STREET DEALER: Now , get the fuck out of here .
SETH: We 'd like room 205 .
DESKMAN: Then you hand me twenty-eight dollars .
SETH: I love this place .
CAROLINE: I think so . If she did n't she should have . I 've only got maybe an hour . Then volleyball practice is over and I have to be home .
SETH: Why ? Nobody 's there .
CAROLINE: The maid They ask her what time I get back . She spies for them .
SETH: I want to have sex and do a hit right as we 're coming .
CAROLINE: Okay . Seth begins undoing her jeans .
ROBERT: Who are these guys ?
ARNIE: On a clear day you can see Mexico City .
HELENA: Arnie , I need money . Somebody threatened my children . They want a first payment of three million dollars .
ARNIE: Helena , if I had it I would give it to you , but I do n't have that kind of money .
HELENA: Arnie , help me . Does n't anyone owe us money ?
ARNIE: Yes , I told you before , there are people who owe you money but they 're not paying . There 's too much heat on Carl .
HELENA: Please . Tell me who Carl sells to . Arnie thinks .
ARNIE: Even if I knew I would n't tell you . You do not want to come into contact with these people . Only Carl knows who they are . That 's his real asset . Ruiz does n't know them . They do n't know Ruiz . Church and State .
HELENA: What about legitimate businesses ? We own a construction concern , real estate
ARNIE: Laundromats for the washing of money . Unfortunately , Carl had only one successful business .
HELENA: Do n't you have some good news ? Is n't there something positive you could say . There is n't . Helena looks Arnie in the eyes .
ARNIE: I remember when I first met you little Helen Watts from the wrong side of somewhere . I had a feeling even then that your survival instincts were pretty well honed .
HELENA: I 'm glad you think so , but I 'm picturing a debt-ridden , thirty-two year-old mother whose ex-husband is eing compared to Pablo Escobar . And I 'm wondering who would want to e with someone like that ?
ROSARIO: You two do n't like me , do you ?
JAVIER: We do n't have an opinion on you .
ROSARIO: Maybe it 's because I 'm getting an apartment nicer than anything you 'll ever see in your life ? Javi says nothing .
JAVIER: The General is a man of his word .
ROSARIO: They will say anything to get what they want , but then you remind them , it 's always tomorrow , tomorrow , tomorrow . Occupational hazard , I guess .
MANOLO: There 's supposed to be someone here to let you in .
JAVIER: What ?
MANOLO: Porfirio Madrigal is not dead . I just saw him . A long beat as Javier considers this .
JAVIER: This is why Salazar is so interested in cleaning up Tijuana . Madrigal , who 's supposed to be dead , owns him . And Madrigal is making a move on Juan Obregon . Javier calmly drives away .
MANOLO: Javi ! Come on . Do n't pull this you do n't care bullshit . This is incredible information . It must be . Javi
JAVIER: We keep our mouths shut .
ROBERT: I think we may have found our Mexican Drug Czar . It 's this General , Salazar . At least I 'll have somebody on the other side I can talk to .
BARBARA: Does this mean you 're going to be gone more ? A long silence .
ROBERT: Possibly . Another silence .
BARBARA: You might want to pencil in a little face-time with your daughter .
ROBERT: Barbara
BARBARA: Because I 'm at the edge of my capabilities , Robert .
ROBERT: The first thing we have to do is present a unified front .
BARBARA: If you start in on the war metaphors I 'm going to drive this car into a fucking telephone pole .
ROBERT: Look , I 'm as worried as you are
BARBARA: No , I do n't think so . Leave me alone , give me money . That 's what I get from our daughter . She has a way of shutting me out that seems very familiar .
ROBERT: Yeah , well , she has a way of self- medicating that probably seems familiar , too . She looks at him , stung .
BARBARA: I 'm not the one who has to have three scotches just to walk in the doo and say hello .
ROBERT: I have a drink before dinner to take the edge off my day . That 's different .
BARBARA: Oh , it is ?
ROBERT: Yeah , because the alternative is to e bored to death .
BARBARA: Why do n't you go in and tell you daughter how bored you are .
CAROLINE: Who is it ? I 'm going to the bathroom .
ROBERT: You 're not going anywhere , young lady . She stands there ; she 's very high .
CAROLINE: Fuck you . I was n't doing anything . You 're like the Gestapo . Robert KICKS the cabinets .
ROBERT: Fuck me ? Oh , okay . Fuck me . Fuck you .
CAROLINE: Like I give a fuck .
ROBERT: What is wrong with you ? What ? You 're going away . You 're getting help somewhere .
CAROLINE: You ca n't make me .
ROBERT: Oh , yes I can .
JAVIER: Where are we going ? Hughes sticks out his hand .
HUGHES: Special Agent Hughes , Drug Enforcement Administration of the United States .
JAVIER: Where are you taking me ? The agents exchange a look .
JOHNSON: Somewhere safe .
JAVIER: Where ?
JOHNSON: A place we have , that we know is protected .
JAVIER: No .
HUGHES: It 's really safe .
JAVIER: Not for me .
JOHNSON: Okay . Where would you like to go ?
JAVIER: It 's important that we work together . Mexico . America . One hand washing the other .
JOHNSON: We agree .
JAVIER: So maybe you tell me about you informants in our operations .
JOHNSON: We thought maybe you 'd have that kind of information for us .
JAVIER: This is a very different proposition . Johnson and Hughes exchange a glance .
JOHNSON: We pay for that kind of information .
JAVIER: Ten years ago Tijuana had no drug problem . Now it is epidemic . Ten years ago America takes a hamme to Pablo Escobar , a hammer to the Miami drug trade , and you allowed everything to move to my country . You dumped the problem at our feet . Now , drug use is epidemic . Now , the treatment centers are full and get no state money . They survive on donations and what they get fo uilding doghouses to sell to the
HUGHES: Javi , You want to come see us again , you 're going on the box . No more of this water-wing bullshit .
JOHNSON: You wan na tell me what the hell that was all about ?
HUGHES: He 's got something . We just have to e patient .
CARL: How 's David ?
HELENA: How 's David ? How 's David ? He 's terrific , Carl .
CARL: Helena
HELENA: We watched his father get dragged away by federal agents . I do n't even know how to begin to tell him where you are or when you 're coming ack Or if you 're coming back . She ca n't even look at him .
CARL: We 'll get through this , I promise . I 'll make it up to you
HELENA: How ? Supportive letters from prison while I 'm being kicked out of ou home ? Do you have any idea what is happening out here ? Our credit cards are maxed . The people at the bank , you should see their faces when I walk in there . I have a letter from the government telling me that anything I sell from our house will be taken against an income tax lien . Our friends are ehaving like the crowd at a public hanging . Nobody will help us . Nobody will take us in . Nobody wants anything to do with us . So tell me , Carl , how you 're gon na make it up to me . Tell me again how we 'll get through this , and maybe while you 're at it you can put your hand up against the glass so we can have a tender moment of connection .
CARL: Helena
HELENA: Tell me what to do , Carl . I need guidance , not a fucking platitude . I 'm not bringing a child into the kind of life I grew up with . I wo n't do it . I want our life back .
CARLOS: I built our house and I do n't want to lose it . Every stone , every brick , every board . My business That would take a lot of private study That you do n't have time for . I suggest you look into the Coronel Into selling it . If you can stomach it , you should look into it . That painting is very valuable .
HELENA: I do n't understand .
CARLOS: Look into the Coronel ; otherwise , there is nothing to do .
MARTY: So it was my birthday an my ex-wife was getting remarried and I was in some church basement telling a bunch of strangers how it was a good day ecause I did n't have to eat out of a dumpster . That was enough to send me out on big one . I 've been thinking a lot about the first step that I came to believe I was powerless over alcohol and that my life had become unmanageable . See my disease tells me I do n't have a disease . That I 'm fine . That it 's my birthday and I can have one little drink , then one little line , then one little Valium , then two more fat lines , then two more 10 mil Valium Six months later I wake up in a sober living house in Philly . And I 'm from Dallas , people . It 's a disease an allergy of the ody and an obsession of the mind . I know that now . So my name 's Marty and today I 'm a grateful recovering alcoholic who did n't eat out of a dumpster . Thanks .
CAROLINE: Hi . I 'm Caroline . I 'm not sure I 'm an alcoholic . I mean I do n't really like to drink . For someone my age it 's so much easie to get drugs than beer . I do n't know , this is really weird and I 'm eally nervous People in the room nod encouragingly .
ART APPRAISER: Tamayo . Carrington . A simply wonderful collection of Mexican Modern . Give me three months . I know several collectors in South America , very discreet .
HELENA: I do n't have three months .
ART APPRAISER: It takes time to find the prope collection .
HELENA: How much will you give me in cash ? Today .
ART APPRAISER: I 'm sorry , but that is the figure I can get today .
HELENA: Get out . Get out of my house .
SALAZAR: I recruited the best men in Mexico for my task force and put them through a rigorous screening process . Not only physical , but also psychological .
ROBERT: I 'd like to bring you up to Washington , walk you around our side of things , and share some of the information we 've been able to develop on your cartels .
SALAZAR: That would be very helpful to me . Also , I received the offer from DEA and the FBI to train some of my men at Quantico . I think this will be extremely useful , a good way for us to absorb some of your methods .
ROBERT: You 've been making very good progress against the Tijuana cartel .
SALAZAR: Yes , I am confident that Juan Obregon will be taken into custody before the end of the year . But , you must understand that it is very difficult ecause of corruption in the police force . We get a tip that he is one place , then we get there and he is already gone , having been warned by someone on our side .
ROBERT: Hopefully the exchange of training methods and information between ou countries will help with this problem .
SALAZAR: Yes , I hope so as well .
ROBERT: Let me ask you a related question . We 've talked about the supply side , ut what about demand ? What is you policy for treating addiction ?
SALAZAR: Addicts treat themselves they overdose and then there 's one less to worry about . Robert can not respond .
RUIZ: This is ridiculous . Why is there no elevator ?
GORDON: When the DEA gets into the narcotics usiness , then we 'll stay at the Four Seasons .
CASTRO: Eddie , how you like your new home ? I hope you hate it as much as I do .
RUIZ: This is not what my lawyers negotiated . Gordon pours himself a cup of coffee .
GORDON: Fuck your lawyers . You are n't getting any cappuccino or Biscotti either .
FRANK: He first came to me in January . That would 've been nineteen eighty- seven . He wanted to rent warehouse space along the harbor . I did n't ask too many questions ; I 'm a usinessman also .
MRS. BERRY: I told Mr. Ayala there were irregularities in his tax return . And I could n't represent him unless we could explain this
SHEILA: I was the company secretary from 1991 to 1994 . I supposedly worked for all six companies . But they were n't I mean , it was just one empty office with a desk and a telephone . We never sold anything the whole time I was there . Sometimes people came and got paid . I do n't eally know what we did .
PROSECUTOR: Did Mr. Ayala say where the money came from ?
SHEILA: No , and I did n't ask .
PROSECUTOR: Where do you think it came from ? Carl 's lawyer , Adler , is on his feet
KAUFMAN: This speculation
PROSECUTOR: I 'll rephrase . Did you feel like you were engaged in a legal enterprise ? Sheila is reluctant to answer .
SHEILA: No , not really .
HELENA: A friend of Carlos Ayala . There is a long pause .
FRANCISCO: You were followed by the police , but they wo n't hear us over the children . I want to use a bomb .
HELENA: You 're kidding . Ca n't you shoot him or something ?
FRANCISCO: I do n't really like guns . You shoot someone in the head three times and some doctor will keep them alive .
HELENA: When will you do it ?
FRANCISCO: I do n't know . Eduardo Ruiz is the only real witness against Carl . The security is very tight . There may not be a way .
HELENA: There 's always a way . If people get to the Pope or the President , you can get to him . Francisco laughs .
FRANCISCO: Careful You 're sounding like you husband , Mrs. Ayala .
JAVIER: What ? What is it ?
ANNA: It 's very hard for me to come and tell you this . Javier just watches her .
JAVIER: Why does he need money ?
ANNA: He has debts . He has gambling debts . He owes a lot of money .
JAVIER: How much ?
ANNA: Nine thousand dollars . A long beat .
JAVIER: What is he planning on telling them ?
ANNA: Well , you know , he 's going to say about Madrigal and Salazar . Javier just looks at her .
ROBERT: Nobody saw her leave ? Yes I understand .
BARBARA: Should we bring the police into this ?
ROBERT: No , not yet .
SETH: She 's not at that place you sent her ?
ROBERT: She snuck away . And we have n't seen her . She has n't come home .
SETH: Oh , man
ROBERT: She has n't called you ?
SETH: I tried to talk to her when she was up there , but they would n't put me through . I 'm surprised she has n't called .
HUSTLERS: What you want ? Rock ? Rock ? Hey , what you want ?
ROBERT: Can you tell me anything ? Do you have any ideas ?
SETH: I do n't know what to say .
ROBERT: I 'm not the police . I do n't care about experimentation . She 's a kid . I 'm worried to death .
SETH: You wo n't say anything to my parents ?
ROBERT: I do n't give a fuck about your parents
SETH: We sometimes went downtown to score .
ROBERT: What ?
SETH: The West End . We buy it off the streets . I can stop , you know , and she ca n't . Two people , really similar , we can talk about anything , but for me it 's like a weekend thing , then I get my shit together , and for her it 's different
ROBERT: You do n't know what the hell you 're talking about . You 're a cocky seventeen year-old and you do n't have a clue what the stakes are . You do n't know the value of the life you 've yet to throw away . And neithe does she .
FACE: What do you want ?
ROBERT: What do you mean , what do I want ?
FACE: Rock or dope , man ?
ROBERT: I do n't want anything .
SETH: Hey man , I 'm sorry . I 'm just trying to help .
ROBERT: You want to help ? Stay the fuck away from her .
SKETCH: What the fuck do you want ?
CAROLINE: Please
SKETCH: What you gon na do ?
CAROLINE: Do n't
SKETCH: You want this ? She nods .
ADLER: Your honor , it has come to ou attention that your honor , while in private practice , previously epresented the town of Seal Beach in their stop-work suit against the Police Department of Seal Beach . We elieve this disqualifies you from hearing this case and we therefore move for a temporary suspension while this is investigated . The judge is surprised to hear this .
JUDGE: Mr. Adler , this is a most unusual motion .
ADLER: Nonetheless , your honor , we feel that our client deserves every fairness afforded under the law .
JUDGE: If this is in any way designed to delay the testimony of Eduardo Ruiz The judge considers .
CASTRO: Remember when we sat on that mo guy , that chef , for like six months ?
GORDON: Oh , man , I 've never eaten so good in my life . Why do n't you develop a useful skill ?
CASTRO: Yeah , like turning into a beautiful woman . They reach the car .
RUIZ: Would you mind if today we walked ? It 's one block . I could use the fresh air .
FRANCISCO: They 're not getting into the car . What are they doing ? They 're walking ight at me .
HELENA: You 've got a gun . Get out of the car and shoot him in the head .
FRANCISCO: They 're going to walk right past me .
CASTRO: Stay here . I 'll get the car .
GORDON: I saw this guy at the courthouse . The car Gordon takes off running , yelling for Castro .
MAN #1: Manolo , how are you ?
MAN #2: Manolo , have we interrupted ?
MANOLO: No . I 'm looking for the waiter . I want to order .
MAN #1: What are you gon na have ?
MANOLO: A steak .
MAN #1: Well , if you like steak , we know a much better place . We 'll take you there .
MANOLO: That 's okay , really . They each take Manolo by an arm .
MAN #2: Manolo , we should really be going now , before it gets too crowded .
MANOLO: I was going to feed them wrong information . Feed them lies to it was for The men say nothing . After a beat
MAN #1: Turn around .
SOMEBODY ELSE: Are you sure you do n't have anything to tell us ?
ARNIE: That was a stupid thing you did . Incredibly stupid .
HELENA: I tried , Arnie . And , I will continue to try .
ARNIE: Have you gone crazy ? You are not Carl . You are n't as good as Carl . They are moving the trial to a high security location . The press has gone berserk . The jury will be influenced . Stay out of things . Let us try to win the case .
HELENA: That is going to be rather difficult when all the evidence is against us .
ARNIE: Helena , please . This is out of you hands .
HELENA: I know I made things worse . I know that and I 'm sorry , but Arnie I need something from you . Something only you can help me with . Helena looks searchingly into his eyes .
ARNIE: Helena
HELENA: I need an introduction to the Obregon Brothers .
ARNIE: I ca n't do that . Helena leans closer to him .
HELENA: I figured out what Carl was up to and I need your help . Will you help me ?
ROBERT: About the other night , I 'm sorry .
BARBARA: Me , too .
ROBERT: God , I do n't get it . Are we supposed to say to ourselves , be prepared to lose her , be prepared to lose ou child ? Why does this happen to someone ? How does it happen ?
BARBARA: I do n't know .
MARQUEZ: Mrs. Ayala . Thank you for coming . I am Juan Marquez , I work for Mr. Obregon . I believe you know my associate , `` Tigrillo , '' the Little Tiger . Helena nods to Tigrillo
HELENA: Yes , he threatened to kill my five year-old son . I was under the impression I would e meeting Juan Obregon .
MARQUEZ: No , this is not possible . And I thank you for coming down here , though I suspect it 's been a pointless journey .
HELENA: Why do you say that , Mr. Marquez ?
MARQUEZ: I hear these stories . Your husband in jail . His business in chaos . Various people fighting over the scraps .
HELENA: My husband is the victim of an informer in your organization , not ours .
MARQUEZ: That is not true , Mrs. Ayala . You oute is compromised . Perhaps it is time for me to deal with othe distributors in California .
HELENA: I do n't think you 're going to do that .
MARQUEZ: You do n't ? Listen to this woman in a man 's world , a very violent world .
HELENA: There are plenty of other suppliers in Mexico .
MARQUEZ: But not in whose interest it is to help you out of debt .
HELENA: My husband had been working on something he called , The Project fo the Children . Are you aware of this ?
MARQUEZ: I do n't know . Perhaps I remembe something .
HELENA: We have the ability to change the color , odor , and physical property of cocaine .
MARQUEZ: You want to smuggle narcotics in Mr. Espastico Jacobo . That 's nothing new .
HELENA: Not in Juan Marquez is confused .
MARQUEZ: I do n't believe you .
HELENA: Get a bowl .
MARQUEZ: You first .
HELENA: I 'm six months pregnant . I wo n't do it .
MARQUEZ: Fine , then we do n't have deal .
HELENA: Fine , then we do n't have a deal .
MARQUEZ: Okay , okay .
HELENA: It should be It 's yours . I want our debt forgiven . I want to e the exclusive distributor of Obregon Brothers Cocaine for the United States . And I want the principle witness against my husband , Eduardo Ruiz , killed .
MARQUEZ: Perhaps Perhaps I 'm afraid I must first ask you to pass a test . I asked the same of your husband and he succeeded with flying colors .
HELENA: That 's crazy . My husband is on trial for smuggling .
MARQUEZ: Exactly , and this is how I know I 'm not getting into business with the U.S. Government .
HELENA: You will help me with my othe problem .
MARQUEZ: Deliver that safely to Tigrillo in San Diego . And we have a deal . Tigrillo escorts her out of the room .
JAVIER: And I have the electronic serial numbers for their cellular phones . They change them every twenty-fou hours but I have a contact at MexTel who can get me the new ESNs within twelve .
HUGHES: That 's good shit .
JAVIER: Now that you have what you want , let 's talk about how I get what I want .
JOHNSON: Oh , do n't worry , Javier , you 're not gon na have any problems there .
HUGHES: I want to take a minute and talk about what type of precautions you 're taking to protect yourself . When Salazar and Madrigal go down , they might send someone to see you .
JAVIER: You worry about getting me the things that I want . I 'll worry about myself .
JOHNSON: You should feel good about this .
JAVIER: I feel like a traitor .
CUSTOMS OFFICER: Please step from the car , Ma'am .
HELENA: I 'm in a hurry
CUSTOMS OFFICER: Step from the car , Ma'am . This wo n't take long from your day . Helena gets out of her car .
OFFICER: Ma'am , we have to ask you to come with us . She follows them toward the Customs building .
CUSTOMS MATRON: Ma'am , we have reason to believe you may have illegal drugs hidden beneath your clothing . I need to conduct a pat down search . Supervisory Inspector Haig will witness the search .
HELENA: You 've got to be kidding me . I 'm pregnant . What if I refuse ?
CUSTOMS MATRON: This pamphlet explains the law and your rights under it . You 're welcome to read it first . It says we have the authority to conduct this search . Would you like to read it first o shall we proceed ?
MRS. CASTRO: Montel Oh , Montel . Gordon hugs her .
GORDON: Yes .
MRS. CASTRO: I know if he could have it back somehow , he would n't do it differently or have it any other way . He would n't . He loved his job .
AGENT: Excuse me , Agent Gordon . Mrs. Castro . Helena Ayala left Club Platinum in Tijuana . The Obregon Brothers ' place . They stopped her at the border but she was clean . She 's in San Diego now . Gordon runs for his car .
HELENA: Did you get it ?
ARNIE: What are you thinking , calling me at home with a message like that ? You 've compromised me and our relationship Helena sits confidently on his couch .
HELENA: The place is swept twice a day . I learned that down in Miami in '85 Arnie . I 'm the housewife . I belong to the most exclusive country clu in La Jolla that accepts Latinos . Until recently , I believed my husband imported hydroponic strawberries , which I donated at the school fair .
ARNIE: It 's the same . What happened to what they gave you ? Helena puts the bag in her purse .
HELENA: I 'm desperate , but I 'm not stupid .
ROBERT: Hello .
BARBARA: The silver wedding cup .
ROBERT: So 's the video camera .
BARBARA: At least she 's alive . Robert turns for the door .
ROBERT: She 'll be at a pawn shop in an hour .
SETH: Hey man , what are you doing ?
ROBERT: Seth has to be excused . He 's going on a field trip .
HELENA: Come on . Time to go .
DAVID: Yeah ! Tigrillo disappears into the restaurant .
SETH: I do n't know , maybe we missed her .
ROBERT: I ca n't believe you used to bring my daughter here , to this place .
SETH: Hey man , back the fuck up . To this place . What 's that shit ? Right now , all over this country , a hundred thousand white people from the suburbs are driving around downtown asking every black person they see , You got any drugs ? You know where I can get drugs ? What kind of effect you think this has on the psyche of a black person , on their possibilities ? If you sent a hundred thousand black people into your neighborhood , Indian Hills , and they asked every white person they saw , hey , you got any drugs ? , within a day , your friends and their kids would be selling . It 's market forces , man . The product 's marked up three hundred percent . You can go out on the street and make five hundred bucks in two hours and then do whatever you want for the rest of the day . You think white people would still be going to law school ? There 's a beat .
ROBERT: You 're starting to piss me off . Get out of the car .
SETH: You 're gon na get me killed .
SKETCH: What do you want ? Robert moves around Seth .
ROBERT: I 'm looking for my daughter , Caroline . She comes here .
SKETCH: This is a business . Get the fuck outta here .
ROBERT: I need to find my daughter . I 'll pay you .
SKETCH: Who the fuck do you think you are ? Where the fuck do you think you are ? Why the fuck do you think I should n't just put you in a dumpster ?
ROBERT: I have money
SKETCH: I got money .
ROBERT: I 'll pay you a thousand dollars . I have it in my wallet .
SKETCH: I want your money , I 'll take you money .
ROBERT: Just tell me where she is .
SKETCH: Do n't do that shit again . Sketch slams the door in their face .
SETH: Great . What a good idea .
JAVIER: Anna . Anna , please . Let me in . He KNOCKS again .
ANNA: I want to believe you . I really do .
JAVIER: You will believe me , because it 's true .
SETH: Open the door . Open the fucking door , man .
MUFFLED VOICE: Go away !
SETH: I know she 's in there . Let me talk to her .
MUFFLED VOICE: I do n't know what you 're talking about . Go away ! Robert reaches the door . Seth sees him .
SETH: I know she 's in there . Robert kicks the door in .
JOHN: Hey , I have n't touched her
CAROLINE: Hi , Daddy .
MARQUEZ: Salazar and Madrigal are no longe with us . A feat none of these people could get accomplished . Juan nods toward Pablo and Tigrillo .
ROBERT: How was she ?
BARBARA: I 'm really not sure . She seemed to ecognize it was n't Serenity Oaks . It 's a pretty hard-core facility , ut at least we know where she is . Maybe it 's what she needs now .
AGENT: Big day . You 're a star .
GORDON: Go shower . You smell .
AGENT: Who is it ?
RUIZ: Fuck off . Gordon watches the interchange
GORDON: Where 's the love gone , Eddie ?
RUIZ: You expect me to be grateful fo spending the rest of my life looking over my shoulder .
GORDON: That thought makes me feel awful . Ruiz pushes eggs into a piece of toast .
RUIZ: Ca n't you for a second imagine none of this had happened ? That my drugs had gone through . What would have een the harm ? A few people get high who are getting high anyway . Your partner is still alive . We avoid having breakfast together . Do n't you see this means nothing ? That your whole life is pointless ?
GORDON: You 're breaking my heart .
RUIZ: The worst thing about you , Monty , is you realize the futility of what you 're doing and you do it anyway . I wish you could see how transparent you are . This food tastes like shit .
GORDON: So go shower already .
RUIZ: You only got to me because you were tipped off by the Juarez Cartel , who 's trying to break into Tijuana . You 're helping them . You work for a drug dealer too , Monty . Ruiz stands and heads for the bathroom .
GORDON: And shave . You better look nice and elievable for the jury .
SOMEBODY ELSE: Hurry up . It 's getting cold .
GORDON: Call an ambulance . Hurry .
PROSECUTOR: Your honor , ladies and gentlemen of the jury Because of the sudden death of Eduardo Ruiz , the people have decided that at this point we can not continue our case against Carl Ayala .
JAVIER: This seizure is one of the largest seizures in Mexican history It epresents the first bilateral effort of the American DEA and the Mexican
ROBERT: The cocaine brand , 911 , is an East Coast brand , a Juarez Cartel brand , and you must know it usually comes through into El Paso ?
JAVIER: I 'm aware of that .
ROBERT: So what 's it doing in Tijuana ?
JAVIER: It could mean that , yes .
ROBERT: That would probably mean the Tijuana Cartel is gaining power ?
JAVIER: It 's possible .
ROBERT: Is it possible to have a Drug Cza in Mexico who is n't connected in some war to one of the cartels ? Javi thinks along time before answering .
JAVIER: Yeah , it 's possible if you 're prepared to die .
ARNIE: Carl , I 'm running late . I 'm coming ight now
CARLOS: Do n't bother .
HELENA: Who was that ?
CARLOS: Arnie . He 's not going to be able to make the barbecue . Carl and Helena share an embrace and a kiss .
HELENA: Come downstairs . Everyone is waiting .
GORDON: Hello , Helena . What a great party .
CARLOS: Who are you ?
GORDON: Nobody . I 'm a nobody who arrested you , but your wife is a murderer .
SECURITY OFFICER: Hey , you ca n't be in here .
GORDON: I 'm a cop .
SECURITY OFFICER: I do n't care .
HELENA: Throw him out of here .
GORDON: You did n't win , Helena . You lost everything . Tell your children a nice bedtime story How you killed my partner .
PRESS SECRETARY: a sterling reputation and close friend of the President , recently confirmed into The Office of National Drug Control Policy our new Drug Czar , Robert Hudson Wakefield .
ROBERT: The War on Drugs is a war on ou nation 's most precious resource our children . Sixty-eight million children have been targeted by those who perpetrate this war and protecting those children must be priority numbe one . There has been progress and there have been failures , but where we have fallen short I see not a problem ut an opportunity .
CAROLINE: On the good days I feel like I get it , like it all makes sense . I can stay in the moment . I do n't have to control everything in the future . And I believe everything is going to work out fine . On the bad days , I just want to gra the phone and start dialing numbers . I want to pull my hair and run through the streets screaming . But , thanks to the people I 've met in these rooms , people like Margaret and Jim and Sarah , people who 've taught me how to listen , I 'm pretty sure I 'll make it through today . Caroline is finished sharing .
ROBERT: My name is Robert . This is my wife , Barbara . We 're Caroline 's parents . We 're just hear to listen .
DIANE: I do n't see why not .
SICK BOY: Oh , fuck . Sick Boy reaches out to Allison .
SICK BOY: Say something , Mark , say something
RENTON: I 'm cooking ' up . There is a silence .
SWANNEY: Sure will , pal , sure will .
SICK BOY: Eughh . Sounds horrible .
RENTON: It was n't that bad .
SICK BOY: Did he you know ?
RENTON: What ?
SICK BOY: You know .
RENTON: No , he did n't make me touch it .
SICK BOY: Oh no , do n't even mention it .
RENTON: He made me lick it .
SICK BOY: God , you 're sick .
RENTON: Begbie settled in in no time at all .
BEGBIE: Rents , Rents , come fucking back here .
RENTON: What was it , pneumonia or cancer ?
GAV: No , toxoplasmosis . Sort of like a stroke .
RENTON: Eh ? How 's that ?
BEGBIE: You 're not going to and fucking hospital . You 're staying there . And you bring me a fucking cigarette . Renton swivels and stands up . And the bag .
ARBLUS: Transform and flee , Kranix ! You must warn all you meet of the horror of Unicron ! Suddenly , the pitiful creature is surrounded by the strange energy cloud and it looks like his body has simultaneously caught fire and been doused with acid .
KRANIX: Arblus ! No !
NARRATOR: It is the year 2005 . The treacherous Decepticons have conquered the Autobots ' home planet of Cybertron . But from secret staging grounds on two of Cybertron 's moons the valiant Autobots prepare to retake their homeland .
IRONHIDE: Every time I look into this thing , my circuits sizzle . I 'm tired of this waiting game , Prime . When are we gon na start bustin ' Deceptichops ?
OPTIMUS PRIME: We still do n't have enough Energon cubes to power a full scale assault , Ironhide .
IRONHIDE: Then let me make another run to Autobot City on Earth . I 'll bring you back more cubes than you 'll know what to do with .
PRIME: Alright , ready the shuttle for launch .
IRONHIDE: YAHOO ! Your days are numbered now Decepticreeps .
JAZZ: No sign of Decepticons in this sector , Prime .
PRIME: What about Moon Base 2 ?
JAZZ: Jazz to Moon Base 2 . PAN UP and through the sky to -
ANOTHER MOON: This is the second moon . It is much closer to Cybertron than the first one . This is where Bumblebee and Spike are stationed .
BUMBLEBEE: Bumblebee and Spike here .
SPIKE: Hey , Ironhide , tell my son , Daniel , I miss him , and tell him I 'll be coming home as soon as we 've kicked Megatron 's tail across the galaxy .
IRONHIDE: Will do , Spike .
PRIME: Commence countdown , Cliffjumper .
CLIFFJUMPER: FiveFourThreeTwo
PRIME: Now , all we need is a little Energon and a lot of luck .
IRONHIDE: If I can dodge Dececpticon rays , I can sure as shootin ' dodge a couple of asteroids .
PROWL: You were saying ?
MEGATRON: Die Autobots !
BRAWN: is cut in half by Megatron 's blast .
ON PROWL: as SCAVENGER MELTS HIM DOWN .
THE INSECTICONS: eat away at the hole in the shuttle to make way for an ARMY of othe Decepticons including Laserbeak who enter , firing .
MEGATRON: This was almost too easy , Starscream .
STARSCREAM: Much easier , oh mighty Megatron , than attacking the real threat the Autobots moon base .
MEGATRON: You 're an idiot , Starscream . Were we simply to wipe out that minuscule base , they could build another one .
IRONHIDE: Fat chance , Megatron !
MEGATRON: Such heroic nonsense !
ON DANIEL: Daniel , a classic twelve year old American boy watches the portable viewe which is like an over-sized Boy Scout compass . WIDEN SHOT to show he is at an old fashioned `` fishin ' hole '' on Earth - surrounded by weeping willows , assorted trees and shrubs , and that his fishing pole is stuck in the dirt , the line floating lazily out on the water .
DANIEL: Let 's watch Ironhide land it , Hot Rod ! As Daniel runs to small skateboard-like device , hits a button , and watches , it transforms into a hoverboard and rides it , like a surfer up a steep , grassy hillside we change angle to feature
HOT ROD: an `` adolescent '' Autobot . He is in robot mode , sitting with his fishing rod held etween two fingers , looking bored with it all .
DANIEL: Hurry or we 'll miss it !
HOT ROD: lopes up hill after Daniel .
DANIEL: Hey ! Let me out .
HOT ROD: Why settle for a peek when you can see everything from Lookout Mountain ?
DANIEL: But we 're not supposed to go beyond City limits !
HOT ROD: Chromo-Chicken !
KUP: disgustedly watches Hot Rod drive up the mountain .
HOT ROD: This is it ! Now take a squint through those babies .
DANIEL: Hot Rod , look ! There 's a hole in the shuttle !
HOT ROD: What ! ?
STARSCREAM: He ducks away from the door .
THE CONSTRUCTICONS: Firing out of the hole .
MEGATRON: He 's furious .
STARSCREAM: It was your stupid strategy !
KUP: What 's that darn fool doing ? Hound looks up and points .
HOUND: Decepticons !
MEGATRON: Attack !
HOT ROD: Hang on !
BLITZWING: Come on down , Autobrat !
HOT ROD: Yiiiiiiiiii !
ON BLITZWING: about to fire , when
SHRAPNEL: who is flying nearby .
BLITZWING: transforms to robot mode and turns as Kup comes flying , feet first , into Blitzwing knocking him off the mountain ledge .
HOT ROD: Not bad for an old timer !
KUP: Old timer ? ! That 's something you 'll never be if you do n't get back to the city . You know what we used to do with cocky , insubordinate upstarts ?
HOT ROD: Save it .
STARSCREAM: transforming into jet mode , fires on them with laser bursts which chew up the ground beside them .
PERCEPTOR: transforms to humanoid and runs toward Three new Autobots , ARCEE , a lovely female Autobot of about Hot Rod 's age , SPRINGER , a very muscula and bantering `` Indiana Jones '' type Autobot and ULTRA MAGNUS , the large and soldierly City Commander .
ULTRA MAGNUS: In other words , Perceptor
SPRINGER: We 're outnumbered ! He turns and FIRES from his hip .
ULTRA MAGNUS: Springer , Arcee , transform Autobot City !
STARSCREAM: TRANSFORMS and hovers in robot mode , firing all around them as they ..dive for the switch and pull it down .
STARSCREAM: There 's no escapeUuuuh ! Just then , the floor of the courtyard STARTS TRANSFORMING - - the center line of the floor snaps shut like the halves of a gigantic steel shelled clam , trapping Starscream 's foot .
ON MEGATRON: as he FLIES OVER SCENE , BLASTING this way and that , shouting
MEGATRON: Breach their defenses !
ON INSECTICONS: who are trailing Megatron , attack the fast CLOSING CITY , trying to GNAW AND DEVOUR their way through the PORTS and BRIDGES leading inside .
KICKBACK: Delicious , eh Shrapnel ?
SHRAPNEL: A little heavy on the electrons . Electrons .
ANOTHER ANGLE: Hot Rod speeds up , passes Kup and ides up and over Kickback 's back , using it like a stunt driver 's ramp to
ON SHRAPNEL: As Shrapnel looks up and reacts Kup hurtles up and over Kickback 's back just as Kickback is starting to rise to see what knocked him face down onto the idge in the first place . Kup goes SAILING OT OVER OPEN SPACE between Kickback 's back and the doorway into the city- -clobbering Shrapnel , who is in the way and landing on the city doorstep , driving in as
THE DOORWAY: transforms , shutting down with metal shields with a `` clank '' sound as Kickback and Shrapnel both leap at is to ite Kup and Hot Rod and instead BREAK THEIR TEETH on steel door , falling face down with a grunt as LAST BITS OF CITY
ULTRA MAGNUS: You can explain your security violation later , Hot Rod ! Now , man your battle station .
HOT ROD: I do n't have to explain my so called violation to you or anyone
KUP: He said `` later ! '' Kup moves OFF with Hot Rod and Daniel .
BLASTER: Lookout and shout ! Yow ! Explosions rock the Crows Nest . Blaster swivels around and tilts to see
CANNON SWIVELS: LASER BLAST cooks out and we FOLLOW IT OFF SCREEN to
THE INSECTICONS: as a Laser BLAST hurls Bombshell up and out of sight and causes Shrapnel and Kickback to get sucked into the vacuum .
BLASTER: Perceptor joins him .
PERCEPTOR: Blaster , Ultra Magnus sends orders to contact Optimus Prime for reinforcements .
BLASTER: Alright ! Cover your receptors , Perceptor ! Blaster transforms to ghetto laster mode and broadcasts VISIBLE waves
THE WAVES: rise and expand into space
BLASTER: Optimus Prime Do you read me ? The Decepticons are blitzing Autobot City . We 're really takin ' a pounding . Do n't know how much longer we can hold out .
MEGATRON: Soundwave ! Jam that transmission .
ON SOUNDWAVE: SOUNDWAVE moves forward and starts heaving CASSETTES upwards toward Blaster 's Crows Nest position .
SOUNDWAVE: Rumble ! Frenzy ! Ravage ! Ratbat ! Eject ! Operation interference .
ON CASSETTES: as they transform and attack the crows nest .
ON RUMBLE: as he starts PILE DRIVER MOTION on Crows Nest windows
RUMBLE: First we crack the shell . Then we crack the nuts inside .
BLASTER: We got Cassette Critters knockin ' on the window !
ON RUMBLE: as he CRACKS THROUGH GLASS and he and others swarm in and attack Perceptor who tries to beat them away
PERCEPTOR: Run , Blaster ! Save yourself !
BLASTER: No way . Two can play !
ON BLASTER: as he spews out CASSETTES which TRANSFORM into CUBBIE , a lion , STRIPES , a tiger , STINGER , a scorpion and BOLTS , a small , tough robot .
BLASTER: Sic 'em !
ON RUMBLE: as Cubbie takes him down by the foot , turning him over and ove
ON STRIPES: as he SNAPS at Ratbat who screams and darts , trying to escape as we move to
PERCEPTOR: You think you got through to Prime ?
BLASTER: Let 's hope so ! Cause if I did n't we 're gon na look like burnt out toaster ovens !
MEGATRON: Constructicons merge for the kill !
SPRINGER: Great ! Megatron 's making his big push and we ca n't even push back !
KUP: Keep at it , Springer , lad ! Help 's at hand ! Together now !
DANIEL: also leans against it , his small legs churning .
THE CATAPULT: starts moving easily now .
ARCEE: I was afraid you 'd be trapped outside the city walls .
HOT ROD: Hey , I was n't worried for a micro-second , Arcee !
ARCEE: Then you probably did n't understand the situation . Before Hot Rod can react , Kup steps back from repositioned Catapult
KUP: That did it !
DANIEL: Kup , Hot Rod ! Look !
ON DEVASTATOR: as he rises up and starts FIRING , HAMMERING , TEARING AWAY at metal shields which create armored walls of the transformed City .
SPRINGER: I got better things to do today than die .
DEVASTATOR: and explode harmlessly as Devastato continues to grunt and tear off armored layers of the city . He grabs Hot Rod and Kup and starts to crush them .
ARCEE: Hot Rod !
OPTIMUS PRIME: Dinobots . Destroy Devastator !
GRIMLOCK: Uhhhh ! Me Grimlock love challenge ! Dinobots , transform !
DINOBOTS: transform into humanoid mode , and , with Grimlock at the front fly out of the shuttle in wedge formation , blasting in unison .
FOLLOW DINOBOTS: In as they transform again and , in dino mode , swoop over to Devastator
DEVASTATOR: Roars towards the Dinobots .
THEIR BATTLE: shakes the Earth
PRIME: Megatron must be stopped .
MEGATRON: as he commands his troops .
PRIME: smashing through a wall of lesse Decepticons .
MEGATRON: Why throw away your life so recklessly ?
OPTIMUS PRIME: That 's a question you should ask yourself .
MEGATRON: hurls himself at Optimus Prime . oth tumble into the walls of the City denting the walls and causing the electronic panels inside to short circuit , surrounding them with a fiery nimbus of crackling electrical energy .
HOT ROD: We 've got to save Prime ! Punching
KUP: That 's his fight , lad ! Stay away . Shooting.. And charging .
MEGATRON: grabs a jagged , spearlike piece of steel and hurls it at
PRIME: The steel `` spear '' pierces his side and sticks in him as he charges Megatron , dodging shots from Megatron 's gun to deliver a huge UPPERCUT which lifts Megatron into the air so high that
MEGATRON: lands and stealthily slips a laser dagge from his boot , turning and slashing at
PRIME: as he comes for him , tearing a gash across Prime 's midsection , which spews smoke and sparks and dropping Prime to one knee .
MEGATRON: Farewell , Prime !
OPTIMUS PRIME: as he lifts chunks of broken concrete and catches the laser dagger on it , tossing it aside as he lunges at-
MEGATRON: who claws his fingers and digs them into Prime 's eyes
HOT ROD: That 's showing him , Optimus !
KUP: knocks two Decepticons on their tails and turns .
ON MEGATRON: as he spots a gun on the ground ahead of him
MEGATRON: No more , Optimus Prime ! Grant me mercy , I beg of you !
OPTIMUS PRIME: You who are without mercy now plead fo it . I thought you were made of sterne stuff , Megatron !
PRIME: Out of the way , Hot Rod .
ON MEGATRON: firing blaster again and again
MEGATRON: Fall ! Fall !
OPTIMUS PRIME: Never !
HOT ROD: Optimus ! Forgive me !
STARSCREAM: How do you feel , Mighty Megatron ?
MEGATRON: Enshrine me !
STARSCREAM: Take this scrap to Cybertron ! Astrotrain , transform and get us out of here !
ARCEE: The Decepticons are retreating .
KUP: Prime did it . He turned the tide ! He shoots into
THE AUTOBOTS: fire after them , closing ranks on the shuttle , and pouring shots into the melee .
STARSCREAM: Astrotrain , take off .
OPTIMUS PRIME: as he lies on an improvised bier-like platform , a profusion of electricity discharging tubes and `` plasma '' bottle devices hooked up to his arms and into his gaping middle wound .
SCANNERS: emit bleeps and show oscilloscopic patterns but sounds and wave patterns are steadily growing weaker and weaker .
PERCEPTOR: is bent over Prime , in microscope mode , examining him He then transforms and straightens up , his voice strained and cracking with emotion .
OPTIMUS PRIME: Autobotsdo not grieve Soon , I shall e one with the matrix .
HOT ROD: Prime !
OPTIMUS PRIME: Ultra Magnus ! It is to you , old friend , I shall pass the matrix as it was passed to me .
MAGNUS: Prime , I 'm just a soldier . I 'm not worthy .
OPTIMUS PRIME: Nor was I , but one day , an Autobot shall ise from our ranks and use the powers of the Matrix to light our darkest hour .
ASTROTRAIN: Jettison some weight , or I 'll never make it to Cybertron .
STARSCREAM: Fellow Decepticons , Astrotrain has equested that we lighten our burden !
BONECRUSHER: In that case , I say it 's survival of the fittest .
STARSCREAM: So I hear a second on that ?
HEALTHY DECEPTICONS: Aye !
STARSCREAM: And against ?
AD LIB: Beat it ! Spare me !
STARSCREAM: Oh , how it grieves me to do this .
MEGATRON: Wait , I still function ! Starscream kicks him out .
STARSCREAM: Wan na bet ?
SCRAPPER: The Constructicons form Devastator , the most powerful robot . We should rule .
SOUNDWAVE: Constructicons inferior . Soundwave superior .
BONECRUSHER: Who are you calling inferior .
HOOK: Nobody would follow an uncharismatic bore like you .
RUMBLE: Hey , nobody calls Soundwave uncrazmatic .
FRENZY: Yeah ! Let 's kick tailgate .
THE CONSTRUCTICONS: try to form Devastator , but
HOOK: Constructicons , unite !
BLITZWING: I am a triple changer . I am worth any two of you . I should run things .
ASTROTRAIN: Stop squabbling or we 're gon na crash .
UNICRON: Welcome , Megatron .
MEGATRON: Who said that ?
UNICRON: I am Unicron .
MEGATRON: Show yourself !
UNICRON: I have summoned you here for a purpose .
MEGATRON: Nobody summons Megatron !
UNICRON: Then it pleases me to be the first .
MEGATRON: State your business .
UNICRON: Bring me the Autobot Matrix . It is the one thing - the only thing that can stand in my way .
MEGATRON: You have nothing to fear . I have already crushed Optimus Prime with my bare hands .
UNICRON: You exaggerate .
MEGATRON: The point is , he is dead ! And the Matrix died with him .
UNICRON: No . It has been passed to their new leader . Get it for me .
MEGATRON: Why should I ? What 's in it for me ?
UNICRON: Your bargaining posture is highly dubious , but very well , I will provide you with a new body , and new troops to command .
MEGATRON: And
UNICRON: And nothing . You belong to me now .
MEGATRON: I belong to nobody .
UNICRON: Perhaps I misjudged you . Proceed on you way to oblivion . The Mist appears and starts to dissolve Megatron .
MEGATRON: No , no . I accept your terms . I accept !
UNICRON: Excellent ! Behold - Galvatron ! X-ray images wiring , circuitry , etc . flash on and off as a new and larger being starts to form , changing from dented Megatron to a huge , new creation Galvatron .
GALVATRON: Long live Galvatron !
UNICRON: And these shall be your minions
SCOURGE: SCOURGE is bearded , fanged and ferocious looking and as soon as he has been CREATED , he roars and stretches and an ARRAY OF SIMILAR CREATURES - smaller and all wearing dark and matching uniforms - are INSTANTLY CREATED FROM OTHERS behind him
UNICRON: Scourge , the tracker.and his huntsmenthe Sweeps .
GALVATRON: To Cybertron !
UNICRON: Bring me the Autobot matrix ! DURING UNICRON 'S COMMAND we CHANGE ANGLE TO SHOW
GALVATRON: I will rip open Autobot after Autobot until it is yours , Unicron .
OTHER DECEPTICONS: in neat ranks but their grim expressions show their displeasure .
STARSCREAM: Get on with the ceremony ! Dirge and others react to EERIE SOUNDS and look up and off . Starscream looks where others are looking and reacts .
GALVATRON: Coronation ? This is bad comedy !
STARSCREAM: Megatron , is that you ?
GALVATRON: Here 's a clue !
GALVATRON: Galvatron .
UNICRON: Bit by bit , we see new sections of the planet being generated . Then , the sinister mist we saw at the beginning of the film starts pouring out . He 's about to do the big munch on..
JAZZ: Where 'd that come from ? !
CLIFFJUMPER: Who cares ? I 'm more worried about where it 's going !
JAZZ: Talk to me , Earth ! We got a situation out here !
BLASTER: He reacts to muffled transmission from Jazz .
CLIFFJUMPER: And it 's attack STATIC obscures the message
ULTRA MAGNUS: Jazz ! Cliffjumper !
JAZZ: Got to.blast free.if we can.. They get in and start retro blasters , the flame of blasters whirling in wild winds as moon is engulfed .
ANOTHER ANGLE: Suddenly it is pulled deep into Unicron .
GALVATRON: How dare Unicron ? ! Cybertron and all it 's moons are mine !
SCOURGE: But remember , WE belong to HIM !
GALVATRON: I.will obey , Unicron ! Decepticons , to Earth ! The torture stops and Galvatron clutches his throat and tries to regain his composure as we
SPIKE: It 's like a terrible nightmare , Ultra Magnus .
BUMBLEBEE: This thing - this juggernaut just ripped the first moon to shreds .
SPIKE: And it 's heading this way .
BUMBLEBEE: We 'll try ' n slow it down
SPIKE: But you 'd better get here fast because Suddenly , static obscures the transmission .
DANIEL: Dad !
ULTRA MAGNUS: Autobots , prepare to board the shuttles . This new menace is more dangerous than all the Decepticons put together . Somehow we must destroy it before it devours Cybertron .
DANIEL: But what about my dad ? He 's on the moon etween that monster and Cybertron .
ULTRA MAGNUS: Daniel , I 'll do everything I can fo Spike .
HOT ROD: And what are we going to do when we get there ? If that thing crunches moons , it 'll make short work of us .
ULTRA MAGNUS: Maybe the Matrix can stop it .
HOT ROD: You 're right ! It can .
KUP: What do you know about it lad ?
HOT ROD: It 's just a feeling . Hot Rod looks up and sees something .
KUP: Look !
ULTRA MAGNUS: To the shuttles ! ! !
GALVATRON: There is no escape . I , Galvatron will crush you just as the magnificent Megatron crushed Prime !
ULTRA MAGNUS: And you 'll die trying just like Megatron ! Ultra Magnus fires Laser and hits Galvatron .
GALVATRON: aaaaaaaah ! Autobot cur ! !
CYCLONUS: You want me to gut Ultra Magnus for you ?
GALVATRON: There are plenty of Autobots for you . Ultra Magnus is mine !
ARCEE: Stay close to me , Daniel
HOT ROD: And you better stay close to me Arcee pulls Hot Rod toward her before he gets hit by lase
ARCEE: No , you 'd better stay close to me . Blu is trying to get Grimlock into Shuttle with the rest of the Dinobots as Decepticon FIRE COMES IN ALL AROUND . Grimlock is like a `` spooked horse '' efusing to be shut in the barn .
BLURR: Nice Dino , good , Dino , sweet Dino ! Wo n't you step into the nice spaceship fo Blurr ? Please , pretty please .
GRIMLOCK: Me , Grimlock , not `` nice Dino ! '' Me bash ains !
ULTRA MAGNUS: as Kup , Hot Rod and Arcee MOVE INTO SCENE
ULTRA MAGNUS: Kup , Hot Rod . Get the Dinobots out of here !
ON SCOURGE: as he TRANSFORMS to Humanoid mode and shouts orders , FIRING AT Blurr who BLURRS PAST and then at Arcee who also SHIPS BY
SCOURGE: No survivors !
KUP: This reminds me of the battle on Alpha 9 , when the Petro-Rabbits were Grimlock , get your noodle out of my face !
GRIMLOCK: Me , Grimlock , love Kup 's war stories !
KUP: You 're living one now ! Engage the boosters for Cybertron 's sake ! Hot Rod nods and quickly passes his hand over bank of SWITCHES all of which GLOW AND PULSE with the action .
ANOTHER ANGLE: as DECEPTICON FIREBALL COMES UP and SPLATTERS AGAINST WINDOW , sending tongues of fire running across the glass behind Hot Rod 's head
HOT ROD: You got 'em !
GRIMLOCK: Tell Grimlock about Petro-Rabbits again .
KUP: I 'll give you Petro-Rabbits . Contact ! The Shuttle lurches and shakes
CYCLONUS: Vaporize them !
SPRINGER: Looks like we 're shipmates , squirt !
DANIEL: All right !
SPRINGER: But if you get space sick , you 're gon na walk home .
ULTRA MAGNUS: Hurry !
SPRINGER: Jump .
ON ARCEE: still going up the ramp while the shuttle slowly leaves the ground .
DANIEL: That was close !
SPRINGER: Believe it or not , this is the fun part .
ULTRA MAGNUS: No time to preheat.Can this ship take it ?
PERCEPTOR: With an accelerated ignition procedure the ceramic housings might create a magnetic flux .
ULTRA MAGNUS: What ?
SPRINGER: He says `` go for it ! ''
HOT ROD: gives the thumbs up gesture .
ANOTHER ANGLE: INCLUDING Ultra Magnus ' shuttle through side port as Springer gives thumbs up signal in return and Daniel waves
ON SPRINGER: as he turns and reacts , looking straight up and ahead
SPRINGER: It ought to be smooth sailin ' from here on in .
ASTROTRAIN: Fuse them !
KUP: Ultra Magnuswhat next ?
ULTRA MAGNUS: Remember what we did off Beta Four !
KUP: I remember it well .
GALVATRON'S SHIPS: which swerve to avoid them as .
GALVATRON'S SHIP: emerges from the chaos .
CYCLONUS: The explosions jammed my sensors . I have lost track of the Autobots !
GALVATRON: Damn it ! ! They did the same thing to me off Beta four !
SHUTTLE: Possible song - optimistic adventure with the suggestion that all dreams might not happen .
KUP: Yep , I remember the dust was so thick off Beta 4 had to use windshield wipers on your optic sensors .
GRIMLOCK: Me , Grimlock , know all about wipers ! Want to hear good part of story !
SWOOP: Good part , Kup ! Tell Swoop good part !
SLUDGE: SLAG Good parttell tell
KUP: Okay , Okay . The dust was really thick and then this gigantic Ick Yak
HOT ROD: Do n't you think we have better things to do now than tell stories Kup ?
KUP: Like what ?
HOT ROD: Like maybe figure out how we 're gon na stay alive .
DINOBOTS: As he is speaking , Auto-Combatant `` sees '' its opening and gives Hot Rod a swift kick in the rear , sending him flying
HOT ROD: Time out , for Cybertron 's sake !
AUTO COMBATANT: Time out , time out , time out ! Suddenly , the shuttle rocks from impact and SPARKS and flames shoot out of large hole in wall
ULTRA MAGNUS: Kup ! Raise your force fields at once ! They 're armed with..
HOT ROD: They 're closing on us !
KUP: Yep , like the shrikebats of Dromedon !
HOT ROD: Yeah , how 'd you beat them ?
KUP: I 'm trying to rememberthere were an awful lot of casualties that day
HOT ROD: Okay , so you were right .
KUP: Do n't run your programs until they 're debugged .
HOT ROD: They 're coming back .
KUP: Let 's just hope we 've screwed up thei trajectories .
HOT ROD: Whew ! ! !
KUP: Yep , I thought we 'd had it that time fo sure .
HOT ROD: Dive !
ANOTHER ANGLE: crushing the area between Hot Rod and Kup .
SPRINGER: Kup and Hot Rod just bought it !
ULTRA MAGNUS: I ca n't deal with that now .
SPRINGER: Face it , Magnus , the Decepticons 're gon na dog us until they see us dead ! Ultra Magnus nods solemnly
ULTRA MAGNUS: Then that 's exactly what they 're gon na see .
ON GALVATRON: as he works controls which eject more Moleculon Missiles .
CYCLONUS: The Autobots have been terminated !
GALVATRON: Excellent . And soon we shall say the same of that infernal Unicron . Suddenly , Galvatron 's body begins to twist , and he writhes in pain .
ARCEE: Did we have to detonate three- quarters of the ship ? !
SPRINGER: Seeing how they would have detonated fou quarters , I think it was a good choice .
ULTRA MAGNUS: Perceptor.can you still locate the Junk Planet ?
PERCEPTOR: Gamma waves in this sector of space create marginal navigation probabilities , however..
ULTRA MAGNUS: Holds his head in his hands as Springe grimaces
PERCEPTOR: Ahem..yes I think I can .
HOT ROD: still cartwheeling down toward the planet elow , trying to change the angle of his fall
THE SQUID: angrily streaks toward Hot Rod .
HOT ROD: Fires at the Squid , but not stopping him .
ANOTHER ANGLE: Hot Rod 's shot plinks off a couple of tentacles , but the squid keeps coming
THE SQUID: releases a laser print ink stream which oils out in the water in a series of dots and `` x '' shapes and retreats .
HOT ROD: Do n't worry , I 'm not coming after you .
HOT ROD: lowers his head and blows blast of ai through head-piece . The air blast clears the water , revealing Kup 's head and torso half buried in the `` sand ''
KUP: Fix me !
HOT ROD: Sure , Kup.right away ! Hot Rod rapidly
KUP: There 's a piece missing .
HOT ROD: No way . See , this was n't yoursit 's some kind of prehistoric ion cruncher.and this doohickey looks like a funky energon funnel and this
KUP: ( moving up and back , bending arms and hands , CREAKING ,
CLUNKING, SQUEAKING: Well , I still think I 'm short a part ! But all things considered , you did an amazing job , lad ! Amazing !
HOT ROD: Really ?
KUP: Yeah , you even got rid of a nasty burr on my rotator ! Now , let 's find the Dinos and get off this twisted planet !
ON KUP: as he transforms it 's evident that a fender is misplaced and a wheel mounted improperly so it wobbles and he rides unevenly with much chugging and oil spewing
KUP: Do n't act hostile . I 'll use the universal greeting .
HOT ROD: Universal Greeting .
KUP: Watch . I 'll have them eating out of my hand .
HOT ROD: Or our faces .
KUP: Bah-weep-Graaaaagnah wheep ni ni bong
HOT ROD: Bah-weep-Graaaaagnah wheep ni ni bong The Sharkticons look interested .
KUP: See , the Universal Greeting works every time . Now , without making any sudden moves , give them an Energon goody . Kup reaches into his belt , presses a button and pulls out an Energon cube . Hot Rod , somewhat suspicious of the whole process does the came .
HOT ROD: This is getting expensive .
KUP: Do n't worry , they 'll reciprocate . They each hand out three Energon goodies to the remaining six Sharkticons The Sharkticons eat them happily . Then , they ack off , eyeing the two Autobots with menace .
HOT ROD: I thought they were supposed to eciprocate .
KUP: Customs vary from place to place . Suddenly , the Sharkticons transform to their vicious mode and lunge at them .
HOT ROD: Every place reminds you of some place else..
KUP: They 're restraining bolts , lad .
HOT ROD: We got to get a new travel agent . What is this place ?
KRANIX: The world of the savage Sharkticons and their cruel masters the Quintessons . They hunt down those who try to escape the wrath of Unicron , and put them on trial .
KUP: But what if they 're innocent ?
KRANIX: Guilty or innocent , the sentence is always the same - death !
HOT ROD: Unicron ? ! Who 's Unicron ?
KRANIX: A planet six times the size of this one that absorbs everything in its path .
KUP: So that 's the monster 's name .
HOT ROD: I wonder if there 's any connection etween it and Galvatron . Suddenly , a Quintesson Guard roars in
JUROR #1: We have your honor .
KRANIX: Spare me this mockery of justice .
JURORS: Guilty ! !
KUP: Not the end I 'd wish for , lad .
DANIEL: Where are we , Springer ?
SPRINGER: The place where everything ends up afte you throw it out .
ULTRA MAGNUS: Brace for impact !
SPRINGER: Remind me to give the Auto Pilot a aise Daniel creeps out from unde Arcee and shakes bits of broken metal and dust off his shoulders
DANIEL: Wow ! That was better ' n the Rolle Coaster at Future World !
PERCEPTOR: The composition of this planet seems to e a chaotic amalgam of discarded ferrous and non-ferrous articulations .
ULTRA MAGNUS: How 's that ?
SPRINGER: ( opening hull door with a
ULTRA MAGNUS: as he straps on TOOL BELT
DANIEL: Can I help , too ?
SPRINGER: It 's rough out there , kid . Stay inside and play with crayons or something .
ARCEE: as she steps forward with a smile , a strange GRID LIKE `` SUIT '' in her hand
DANIEL: Wow ! Dad 's exo-suit . He told me about it but I never saw it .
ARCEE: Here , try it on . She starts helping him into the exo-suit .
ON DANIEL: as he gets inside the `` suit '' which fits over his body like a grid-work metal `` cage . ''
SPRINGER: Just think about what you want to do efore you do it !
DANIEL: brows knitted , thinking .
SPRINGER: Do n't fight it Dan-O .
DANIEL: It 's kind of tricky .
ARCEE: For the first time out , you were great !
SPRINGER: Show time 's over ! We 've got work to do !
OTHER JUNKIONS: Yeah , or your money back ! Wreck-Gar shows large JUNK GUN with all sorts of razo sharp fins and rusty little rocket missiles mounted around the howitzer like arrel
GRIMLOCK: Yes , me , Grimlock , noble ! Me , Grimlock search for friends .
A PATH: It probably is n't lined with primroses , ut it should be .
GRIMLOCK: GRIMLOCK You good friend to Grimlock . I eward you , sometime .
GALVATRON: Why do you torture me ? !
UNICRON: You have failed .
GALVATRON: No , Unicron . Ultra Magnus is dead .
UNICRON: Then where is the matrix ?
GALVATRON: Destroyed , with him .
UNICRON: The matrix can not be destroyed . And Ultra Magnus lives on the planet of Junk . Stalk him . Cut him open ! And ing the matrix to me .
GRIMLOCK: Me Grimlock , positive Hot Rod and Kup close ! Get thump , thump , thump
SLAG: Me , Slag say you are full of beryllium alony . He is just about to fall in when
GRIMLOCK: Me , Grimlock , say you full of cesium salami ! Slag gets up
SLAG: Beryllium balony !
GRIMLOCK: Argh !
SLAG: Like your head ! Grimlock jumps on Slag and wrestles him to the ground . Suddenly , a SQUEAKY , ODDLY CHILDISH VOICE speaks from o.s .
GRIMLOCK: Who say that ?
WHEELIE: Friends find . Look behind . Many Face lie . You fool ! You buy !
GRIMLOCK: Me , Grimlock , `` fool ? ''
WHEELIE: Picture you got . Now fool you not ! Grimlock raises a claw to swipe Wheelie off Slag 's head
GRIMLOCK: Me , Grimlock , no like you !
ON WHEELIE: as he scowls and quickly loads FIRESTONE IN SLING and slings it onto Grimlock 's nose where it EXPLODES making Grimlock yowl and pull back , feeling his reddened nose and speaking through his nose angrily
GRIMLOCK: Doooooooow ! Why boy hit by dose ?
WHEELIE: Wheelie say , find friends today ! Grimlock and Slag react as we
KUP: Remember when you put me together today ?
HOT ROD: Sure , that 's all I got to think about .
KUP: I know what part you forgot .
HOT ROD: I have nothing but contempt for this court .
KUP: That doohickey you lost was part of my shoulder socket . Watch this , lad without it , I 'm double jointed as Houdini .
HOT ROD: Wish you 'd figured that out a little sooner .
KUP: Better late than never !
HOT ROD: They 've got more Sharkticons than we have photon charges ! Kup transforms to Auto mode .
KUP: Let 's hold a demolition derby ! Then , he oars into a bunch of them , slamming a massive stack into the wall .
HOT ROD: Did n't even bend a fender .
KUP: Yeah , but look . There are a lot more of those cam dinging , grill-crackin ' things .
HOT ROD: We ca n't hold out forever , but we can give them one whopper of a repair bill .
GRIMLOCK: Lowers his teeth to devour a much smalle Sharkticon , the Sharkticon bares his teeth , realizes that he 's a second stringer , and scampers away .
THE SHARKTICONS: suddenly back off and begin transforming to the dinobots .
HOT ROD: I never thought I 'd be so happy to see those big bozos .
GRIMLOCK: Me Grimlock no bozo . Me king !
THE SHARKTICONS: for a brief instant , do n't seem to know what to do . Then , they charge the Quintessons .
THE CHASE: The Quintessons start to flee , but it 's clear that the Sharkticons , who clim over the stacked bodies of othe Sharkticons , are going to catch them .
KUP: I think the problems on this planet will e solved very shortly .
HOT ROD: But what about our problems . We need a ship .
WHEELIE: WHEELIE You get a ship if I get a trip .
HOT ROD: Who are you .
SLAG: Him Wheelie , him friend .
HOT ROD: HOT ROD He 'll be mine too , if he can find a Quintesson ship .
SPIKE: If this does n't do it , nothing will .
BUMBLEBEE: now with a new bumpersticker which is a Unicron with a red circle and slash through it , looks very fidgety .
THE SPACESHIP: takes off .
ON UNICRON: His mist surrounds the planet
BUMBLEBEE: Five , four , three , two , one
SPIKE: Let 's get out of here !
ON UNICRON: The great Maw opens and we hear a grand cosmic roar ! Suddenly , the smoke and space junk from the explosion are sucked into his mouth .
SPIKE: We 're being sucked into it !
PERCEPTOR: Be sure the fittings are securely welded !
BLURR: Absolutely , positively , definitely
DANIEL: This exo-suit is fantastic ! Want me to do that ?
BLURR: Weld ? You ? Really ? Well , why not ? Give it a try , but think it through first ! Daniel knits his brow , extends FINGER OF EXO- GLOVE which is part of exo-suit .
ULTRA MAGNUS: as he , too , hears and then looks up and sees the Decepticon force
SPRINGER: Cancel that last order .
DANIEL: What do I do ?
BLURR: Transform ! You can do it !
ON DANIEL: as he reacts , looks around , thinks , brows knitting , looking off , reacting
DANIEL: Transform .

SWEEP: He lets out a rayblast
ULTRA MAGNUS: Perceptor !
ON PERCEPTOR: He transforms to humanoid mode .
PERCEPTOR: It appears that my lacerations were primarily superficial .
ULTRA MAGNUS: Then move it
SWEEPS: which streak over in deadly formations .
ULTRA MAGNUS: He stands and shoots .
ULTRA MAGNUS: Then use that time to escape ! The Matrix was designed for an emergency like this . I 'll try to unleash its power .
SPRINGER: But what if it does n't work .
ULTRA MAGNUS: Until all are one !
GALVATRON: Sweeps , quarter him !
GALVATRON: Unicron , my `` master , '' with this I shall make you my slave ! Galvatron gets into Cyclonus and flies off
DANIEL: as he moves out and looks down at Ultra Magnus ' remains
BLURR: Without the Matrix there is no hope . No hope at all !
SPRINGER: Get gone !
A JUNKION: roars alongside Springer on his motorcycle and throws out laser barbed grappling hook , trying to hook Springer . Springer ducks first pass of hook .

SPRINGER: It 's not hard to knock 'em down . It 's getting them to stay down that 's the trick .
ON ARCEE: as she fires at a Junkion who is trying to swerve her off the road knocking him off the motorcycle The Junkion looks down at his missing arm , digs around in the junk for a minute , comes up with another , and then transforms to a motorcycle .
ANOTHER ANGLE: as Junkion rides over to her , starts elting her with junk sword
ARCEE: They 're indestructible !
ON DANIEL: as he skids , stopping his Exo-Suit as he eacts to what 's ahead
DANIEL: They 're everywhere !
ON SPRINGER: as he stops and Arcee , Daniel , Percepto and Blurr stop around him . They close anks and look out at the Junkions grimly
PERCEPTOR: Perhaps they 're not as vicious as they look .
ON SPRINGER: reacting to Wreck-Gar 's noises and eyeball display
SPRINGER: Positive thinking gets on my nerves . Suddenly , all react to sound and wind of passing space cruiser their P.O.V- HOT ROD , KUP AND DINOBOTS IN CRUISER as it shoots past and banks , coming back for a closer look
DANIEL: as he looks up at passing Cruiser and waves
PERCEPTOR: I would n't count on that !
KUP: Not since the Crocodillos of Strontero have I seen such a sight .
GRIMLOCK: Maybe they make me king , too !
KUP: Do n't hold your breath , your majesty .
JUNKIONS: Everything must go by midnight ! With a SINGING ROAR of musical , tribal excitement , the Junkions sweep Springe and our friends along with them , following course of landing Cruiser to
ON DOORWAY: as Hot Rod steps out with big smile and hand full of energon sticks followed by a very wary Kup , and the Dinobots with Wheelie riding Sludge 's neck .
HOT ROD: Guns are n't exactly friendly .
KUP: Neither are they in case you have n't noticed .

WHEELIE: claps his hands and gleefully makes noises as he hops about , dancing with Junkions until we CUT TO
HOT ROD: Where did you learn to talk like that ?
THE WATCHMAN: On it is a crazy Eddy-type commercial .
KUP: looks around nervously .
ULTRA MAGNUS: You 're all alive
HOT ROD: The matrix ! All turn to Ultra Magnus .
ULTRA MAGNUS: It 's gone
KUP: And with it , all hope .
HOT ROD: No The matrix will not fail us .
ARCEE: Did n't you hear Ultra Magnus . We do n't have it anymore . Galvatron does .
HOT ROD: Then we 've got to trust in ourselves , and no matter what they odds , destroy Unicron .
JUNKIONS: Destroy Unicron Kill the grand poobah Flush cosmic troubles down the drain .
SPRINGER: Listen , I do n't want to rain on anybody 's parade , but how are we going to move the army to Unicron . We do n't have enough oom on that ship .
ULTRA MAGNUS: You have ships here ?
SPRINGER: What 's he talking about ?
UNICRON: Are n't we getting pompous ?
GALVATRON: I now possess that which you most fear . Unicron LAUGHS and the force of it rocks the surface of the planet , knocking Galvatron to his knees .
GALVATRON: taste my wrath .
UNICRON: You underestimate me Galvatron .
GALVATRON: No ! ! !
SHOCKWAVE: Decepticonswe 're unde attackScramble - Then his voice is cut off as
GALVATRON: GALVATRON Stop feeding him , you fools !
HOT ROD: I do n't believe it .
DANIEL: Wow ! THEIR P.O.V . - UNICRON Destroying CYBERTRON
KUP: Nope , never seen anything like it .
HOT ROD: I knew there had to be a first time . Battle stations !
UNICRON'S CHEST: Galvatron , the matrix hanging around his neck . Transforms to Cannon and fires up at A bright panel on Unicron 's chest
OTHER JUNKIONS: Or your money back !
CLOSER: tears it in half .
JUNKIONS: Free bonus surprise !
THE CRUISER: Is suddenly struck by a ray from Unicron 's eye , and half of it is knocked off .
DANIEL: Where 's Hot Rod ?
SPRINGER: Sees something in the distance .
SPRINGER: I do n't know , but I hope they did n't get him .
KUP: Debugoids !
ARCEE: Quick ! This way .
HOT ROD: The Autobot Matrix !
GALVATRON: It will do you no good , Autobot . It can not be opened .
HOT ROD: Not by a Decepticon .
GALVATRON: It is strange that we should find ourselves as allies
ON GALVATRON: Suddenly , his body is violently twisted , and his arms are almost broken off .
GALVATRON: Uhhhh
UNICRON: Destroy him , or feel yourself torn from limb to limb .
GALVATRON: Of course , my master !
ON GALVATRON: He peers into the gloom .
GALVATRON: Puny Autobot , you lack even Prime 's courage . There is no response .
ASSORTED SHOTS: Unicron now stands atop Cybertron , fighting the various ships that swarm around him like bees . Rays streak from his one good eye .
THE DINOBOTS: Now reaching Unicron 's butt , start kicking .
GRIMLOCK: Me Grimlock kick Butt .

ARCEE: Daniel !
DANIEL: I 'm okay . They do n't even see me .
KUP: They must not programmed to catch flesh creatures .
SPRINGER: Us , on the other hand
ARCEE: Daniel Try to find help ! Arcee fires
UNICRON'S STOMACH: This is the central processing area fo Unicron 's `` food '' and `` energy . '' A long conveyer belt drops junk into a clear , ubbling vat , where it is separated into aw material and energy . The energy , which comes out in raw form , goes into a machine and is crunched into energon cubes , while the solid material , is separated into it 's component metals and plastics , formed into ingots and sent elsewhere in an assembly line fashion .
DANIEL: watches this with awe until he sees
ON DANIEL: He dashes to the shores of the glowing lake
DANIEL: Cliffjumper ! Jazz !
SPIKE: Shut off the control , Daniel . Daniel looks around . Then , he sees .
A CONTROL: .. which controls the whole thing .
ON DANIEL: He runs up a catwalk towards it .
DANIEL: What do I do ? It does n't have any uttons or anything .
SPIKE: Shoot it , Son .
DANIEL: But I do n't have a gun .
SPIKE: Use your exo-suit .
CLIFFJUMPER: Hurry !
DANIEL: Starts frying the command console !
DANIEL: I ca n't stop it !
SPIKE: Son .
GALVATRON: Come out , Autobot . We all must die sometime .
GALVATRON: No , I will crush you with bare hands . Hot Rod transforms back to car and tries to ace away Galvatron jumps afte him and catches him Hot Rod , nearly pinned by Galvatron transforms to humanoid mode .
HOT ROD: Gasps .
GALVATRON: Die !
ANOTHER ANGLE: On Hot Rod , his hands , nearly dead , spring to life for a moment and grasp the Matrix which hangs from Galvatron 's chest .
OPTIMUS PRIME: Arise , Rodimus Prime .
HOT ROD: Optimus !
GALVATRON: Nooooooo !
HOT ROD: This is the end of the road , Galvatron . With that , he picks up the Decepticon and throws him through
SPRINGER: I 'm almost out of energy . Suddenly , he looks up and sees one of the creatures explode above
JAZZ: Let 's burn rubber !
KUP: I knew you had potential , lad !
RODIMUS PRIME: Autobots , transform and roll out . Rodimus Prime transforms into truck mode as the other Autobots also transform . Daniel and Spike jump into him . Then , in a continuous line , he shoots off , the othe Autobots racing behind him .

EDGAR: You bet . The men nod , and Old Fred drives off .
VAL: Good morning , Mr. Bassett , this is your wake-up call . Please move your fat ass .
EARL: You dumb shit .
VAL: Did it yesterday . Franks and eans .
EARL: Noit was eggs . I did eggs .
VAL: Hell you did . Your turn .
EARL: I was in one . A bolt of lightning lew up cottonwood tree . Three hundred head going hell-bent fo the horizon . Was n't so damn funny , I can tell you .
VAL: If there was one nearby I 'd probably ask him .
EARL: I keep thinking , if we were but half serious about money , we should quit being hired hands and
VAL: Handymen , Earl . We 're handymen .
EARL: Whatever the hell we are , we should quit and go get ourselves some real employment . Val gestures to the vastness around them .
VAL: What , and give up all this personal freedom ?
EARL: Has a lot of rain .
VAL: Do not talk to the driver .
EARL: UhDigging that waterhole fo Nestor .
VAL: Burt and Heather 's place is closer . Let 's do their kitchen today . Do Nestor tomorrow .
EARL: Nestor 's out of town tomorrow . We do n't dig today . We do n't get paid today . Damn it , Valentine , you never plan ahead . You never take the long view . Hell , here it is Monday and I 'm already working on Wednesday . It is Monday , right ?
VAL: Who the hell 's that ? That 's not what 's his namethe grad student ?
EARL: Nah , it 's September . Must be the new one .
VAL: The new one ! That 's supposed to be a girl !
RHONDA: Hi , I 'm Rhonda . Rhonda LeBeck . I 'm up here for the semester
VAL: Yeah , geography .
RHONDA: Right , geology . And you have to be Val and Earl . I 've heard all about you .
EARL: We deny everything . Rhonda smiles .
RHONDA: Listen , got a question for you . Do you know if anybody is doing any lasting or drilling or anything like that ?
VAL: Around here ? Why would they ?
RHONDA: Well , I 'm supposed monitor these seismographs . You know , they measure vibrations
VAL: Yeah , vibrations in the ground .
RHONDA: Yeah , well , I 'm getting what I efer to scientifically as `` weird vibes . '' every sensor I 've got is giving me strange readings . I mean , the school has had these machines up here three years and they 've never recorded anything like this .
EARL: Well , we 'll ask around . Let you know if we hear of anything .
RHONDA: Thanks . God , I hope they 're not screwed up . I might have to bag the whole semester . Anyway , sorry to bother you .
EARL: No problem . Nice meeting you . Hope you get it sorted out .
VAL: What the hell do we know about seismographs ?
EARL: Nothing . But it sure might be a nice way of getting to know her .
VAL: Why ?
EARL: Goddamnit , Valentine , you wo n't go for any gal unless she fits that damn list of yours A to Z
VAL: Well , sure .
EARL: And is dumber than my hind end . Like that Bobby Lynn Dexter
VAL: Tammy Lynn Baxter .
EARL: Do n't matter . They 're all the same dead weight . Ca n't make a decision , ca n't walk because of their shoes , ca n't work because of their fingernails . Make my skin crawl !
VAL: Well , I 'm a victim of circumstance .
EARL: I thought you called it you pecker . Look , do n't make the mistake I made . Twenty years of looking for a woman exactly like Miss October 1968 , and where 'd it get me ? Here with you . Val rolls his eyes `` Give me a break . ''
MELVIN: Oh , man , I 'm really shaking . But he steers clear of their truck .
BURT: No , Pham , they 're not hollow points . I ordered hollow points and that 's what I want .
HEATHER: Hi , guys , what you been up to ?
VAL: Ran into the new college student , Rona .
EARL: Rhonda . Rhonda LeBeck . She 's getting some kind of strange eadings on her things .
BURT: Damn , you know , those kids turn up oil or uranium or something out therenext thing the Feds will be at our door . `` Sorry , time to move . Eminent domain . ''
HEATHER: Down , honey , down .
VAL: Yeah , Burt . The way you worry , you 're gon na have a heart attack efore you get to survive World Wa
PHAM VAN: Hey Val , listen . Bearing going out , you think ?
VAL: Could be .
EARL: Catch it later , Pham . Got ta get over to Nestor 's .
VAL: Right . We plan ahead . That way we do n't do anything right now . Earl explained it to me .
BURT: A beauty , is n't it ? We bought three of them for the rec room .
VAL: We sell 'em to you for three bucks a piece !
PHAM VAN: And I appreciate it .
VAL: You do n't get it , Pham . The idea was we were ripping you off .
BURT: Melvin , you little pain-in-the-ass !
MELVIN: It was n't me , man ! Your truck 's just screwed up , that 's all .
VAL: Why do n't his parents ever take him to Vegas with them ?
EARL: You got ta ask that ?
NESTOR: It came out great , boys . Should fill up just fine come the next ain . Lem me have your bill .
VAL: Yeah , Nestor , we know . Do n't worry about it . Catch us when you can .
EARL: No , we 're not too easy-going . This area is economically depressed .
VAL: So what if we just did ittoday . Pack up . Drive straight down to Bixby . Get serious .
EARL: We could . We could . But we 'd have to get really serious . It 's gon na cost twice as much to rent a place .
VAL: So ? That car wash pays good , and they 're always looking .
EARL: Car wash ? ! That 's got no future . If we 're gon na take the plunge we oughta have a better plan than that .
VAL: Yeah , sure . Go ahead and plan itfor a year or two .
VIOLA: Stop it ! Stop it , you horrid animal ! I 'm going to give her back to my son . I swear it .
VAL: Hey , Viola , you 've got my permission .
EARL: God almighty , my mama sure did n't aise me for this . Val gets up and starts the pump 's gas engine .
VAL: Well , you 're the one wo n't work in the car wash. You 're the one 's got ta have a plan .
EARL: Damn it , Val ! Not having a plan is what keeps us doing jobs like this !
VAL: What keeps us doing jobs like this is you dragging your feet . I was up for going to Bixby . I was getting excited .
EARL: In the past year I must 've said a hundred times `` We got ta get out of Perfection . We got ta bette ourselves . '' You gon na stand there in broad daylight and tell me you think I 'm the reason we 're still here ? You want to know how close I am to going to Bixby right now ?
VAL: I 'll call that little bluff . How close ?
EARL: Uh oh , it 's Nancy . She wants another load of firewood .
VAL: Forget it , man . It 's not worth it . Nancy spots them and beckons excitedly .
EARL: She 's got us . Now , listen , the plan is we have done our last jo in Perfection .
VAL: That 's the plan .
NANCY: Mindy , honey , do n't pogo in the street . Hey , guys , I 've got a jo for you
EARL: Sorry , Nancy . We ai n't doing odd jobs anymore . We 're headed fo Bixby permanent .
NANCY: Oh , sure My God , you really are !
VAL: Yep , we 're relocating to an area with a greater economic base . Hey , Mindy , what 's the count ?
MINDY: Six hundred three , six hundred four , six hundred five
VAL: Go for it !
NANCY: Gee , guys . I made the big decision . I 'm putting in that satellite dish . I was going to offer you five hundred dollars .
EARL: We did it ! We faced temptation and we did not bend !
VAL: Damn straight ! Now there 's nothing etween us and Bixby but nothing ! They zoom past the sign . VAL Last time we 'll see that sign !
EARL: Last time we hit that goddamn pothole !
VAL: Last time down this damn twisty oad !
EARL: Last chance , asshole . Run , run !
VAL: Jeez , look at that guy .
EARL: One job I 'd never take is working around electricity .
VAL: Especially when it 's two hundred feet off the ground . But as the pass the tower VAL Hey , hold upThat 's Edgar Deems !
EARL: You 're full of shit .
VAL: He 's only got one damn jacket . That 's him , I 'm telling you .
EARL: Man , oh , man . He must 've really < /u een drunk this time . Edgar ! What the hell you doing ? Get on down from there !
VAL: Well , shit , we ca n't leave him up there .
MEGAN: No , it 's fine . You did the right thing . When Jim is done we 'll call the Coroner 's office in Bixby . We 'll take care of it . Poor Edgar .
EARL: Well , I see you got all the wallboard up .
MEGAN: That was easy . You two did the hard part . Sure sorry you 're leaving . Jim climbs out of the pick-up .
EARL: Was is a heart attack ?
JIM: He died of dehydration . Thirst .
VAL: But that does n't make sense . That takes a couple of days , does n't it ?
JIM: Three or four even .
EARL: You mean he sat up there three o four days ? Just sat there till he died of thirst ? Jim shrugs . Everyone is mystified .
VAL: If he did , why did n't he use his damn shotgun ?
EARL: Maybe he just could n't pull the trigger
VAL: Oh sure , he figured it was easie to die of thirst ? Come on , sombody must 've chased him up there .
EARL: Oh , you mean somebody who ai n't scared of a twelve gauge shotgun . And then what did they do ? Camp out down below and just wait fo him to die ? Val has no answer . It 's too weird .
VAL: Well , whatever the hell happened it 's just one more goddamn good eason to haul ass out of this place .
EARL: You got that right .
VAL: Probably up a pole starving itself to death .
EARL: Okay , the plan is pedal to the metal the whole way . We do n't stop till we hit the carwash , not even to pee .
VAL: I 'll go with that plan .
EARL: Not here .
VAL: What the hell is going on ? I mean WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON ? ! !
EARL: You guys better get the hell outta here ! We got a killer on the loose !
HOWARD: What ? Carmine stops jackhammering to listen .
EARL: A murderer , man ! A real psycho . He 's cutting people 's heads off ! I 'm serious ! I 'd high-tail fo town if I was you ! Val and Earl speed away .
CARMINE: They 're drunk .
HOWARD: Yeah
NESTOR: His head ? You mean just his head ?
VAL: Yeah , really sick , man . Sweet Old Fred .
PHAM VAN: Something happen to Fred ?
MELVIN: Are you serious , man ? They killed him just to take his sheep ?
EARL: He did n't have nothing else to steal . Neither did Edgar .
MIGUEL: What happened to Edgar ? Val stares at the phone .
VAL: I do n't believe this . The phone is out ! Pham , your phone is out !
PHAM VAN: I did n't do it ! What 's going on ? Val and Earl rush out .
NESTOR: We 've got ta get the police up here . You guys got ta step on it to Bixby . Earl hands Val the key .
VAL: Consider it stepped on .
EARL: Well , there 's sure as hell nothing to stop us now . Everybody we know etween here and Bixby is already dead . Earl points ahead and screams
VAL: Those assholes are supposed to be u > fixing the goddamn road ! Hey ! Where are you guys ? People got ta use this road , you know ! You on a booze break or what ? !
EARL: Val ! Val !
VAL: Jesus ! I do n't believe this !

VIOLA: Looks likeand eel .
NESTOR: Naweels live in water .
VAL: Soit 's some kind of snake ?
EARL: Or a big mother slug maybe ?
BURT: Some kind of mutation ?
PHAM VAN: Do n't touch , do n't touch .
BURT: It 's dead all right . Tore the damn thing in half .
EARL: It must 've grabbed us . That 's why the truck stalled-out .
VAL: Yeah ! Next time I tell you I 'm not hung up !
BURT: Stalled out your truck ? Have to be one strong son of a bitch . Pham Van leaps over them .
PHAM VAN: I give you boys five dollars fo it .
VAL: Twenty .
PHAM VAN: Okay , ten dollars .
EARL: Fifteen .
PHAM VAN: Okay , fifteen .
VAL: Damn right fifteen . Burt is deep in thought .
BURT: Just one of these could n't eat up off a whole flock of sheep . There 's got ta be more out there , a lot more .
EARL: Slick as snot and I 'm not lying .
VAL: Fifteen lousy bucks .
EARL: A man who plans ahead .
BURT: Look , we organize , we arm ourselves . We go out , we find those damn snake things , we make 'em extinct .

HEATHER: Come on , Nancy , do n't let 's get personal . We need to do something .
BURT: Damn right . You folks got ta analyze the situation . With that oad out we 're completely cut off . Got the cliffs to the north , mountains east and west . That 's why Heather and me settled here in the first place , geographic isolation .
NANCY: Wellthere must be dome way to get help .
VIOLA: Yes , that 's what I say .
BURT: How , for chrissake ? You gon na walk thirty-eight miles to Bixby ?
MIGUEL: Hey , what about Pham Van 's saddle horses ? All heads turn toward Pham Van .
PHAM VAN: You 're welcome to them . Does anybody know how to ride ? All heads turn toward Val and Earl .
JIM: I 'm dead . Let 's finish in the morning .
MEGAN: We have to go into Bixby in the morning . The concrete blocks are in .
JIM: The con ! Oh my God .
MEGAN: Just keep looking at that beautiful sky .
JIM: What ?
MEGAN: That 's the sky that 's going to be over our roof every night , when we 're done .
JIM: Ah , but consider this , if we do n't finish the roof , we can looks at that sky all the time .
MEGAN: We could always buy a new generator .
JIM: Am I sure ? ! It was right there . There 's the cord .
MEGAN: Well do n't then ! You do n't want to fall in .
JIM: What the ? But Megan is all action . She yanks him back .
MEGAN: Come on . Get away from it !
JIM: God , what a stink !
MEGAN: Never mind ! Let 's go ! Let 's just go into town or something ! Jim , u > please ! She hustles him bodily toward the car during
JIM: You know , I bet it 's geological o something , like natural gas , or a geyser . They stink like that . Remember in Yellowstone ?
MEGAN: Stop it ! Stop it ! Somebody stop it !
VAL: Pham , we do n't want to be stuck on a couple of canners . They bette e fast .
EARL: Relax . A snake thing like that could n't move too quick .
VAL: Screw you . For all you know they could fly .
EARL: You want the rifle or the Smith ?
VAL: The rifle .
BURT: You guys all set ?
EARL: Ready as we 'll ever be .
BURT: Heather and I are going to drive around a little , see if we can find that college girl and tell her to get her ass back into town .
VAL: Good idea . And we 'll swing by the doctor 's place . They were going to go into Bixby but we do n't know if they left before the road was out . Val and Earl mount up .
HEATHER: Hold on . You guys oughta take something that packs more punch than that thirty-thirty . Take one of our Browning autos , or even my model seventy It 's three-seventy-five H and H mag .
EARL: Geethanks , Heather . Hope we do n't need it .
MELVIN: IT 'S GOT ME ! IT 's GOT ME ! AAAAHGH !
BURT: You stupid punk ! You came thatthat close ! !
EARL: One of these days , Melvin , somebody 's gon na kick your ass .
BURT: Wellyou fellas watch yourselves .
NANCY: Come back with the Sheriff .
NESTOR: Sheriff , like hell . Come back with the National Guard .
EARL: You know , we ca n't possibly make Bixby by nightfall . Val does n't want to hear it .
VAL: Great . Thank you .
EARL: Car 's gone . We just missed them , that 's all .
VAL: Then where 's the goddamn Conway Twitty coming from ?
EARL: Here 's the planWe do n't even < /u stop . Ride like hell . Tonight we keep right on going . We 'll walk the horses .
VAL: That is the planI mean , goddamn it ! What the hell are those things ? How could they bury an entire Plymouth station wagon ?
EARL: Why would they do it ?
VAL: I knew it ! Pham Van would n't know a decent horse if ! But Earl 's already drawing his rifle .
EARL: Shut up ! They got wind of something they do n't like !
VAL: Oh shit !
EARL: Yeahyeah . What about the hor ?
VAL: That 's how they get you ! They 're under the goddamn ground !
EARL: What the hell are they ?
VAL: Sons of bitches !
EARL: Nopejust one .
VAL: It 's gaining on us ! !
EARL: We can do it , we can do it !
VAL: Cold , my ass ! It 's dead ! We killed the bastard !
RHONDA: Hi , guys , how 're you doing ? Look , can I ask you something ? Did you just notice something weird ? Vibrations ? You know , some kind of earth tremor ?
EARL: Jesus Christthink it smells like that 'cause it 's dead ?
RHONDA: I do n't see any eyesmust be totally subterraneanand those tentacles
EARL: I think they shoot right outta its mouth , hook you , and pull you right in . Good thing we stopped it efore it killed anybody else .
RHONDA: Yeah , I 'm lucky it did n't find me . This is important , you know . This is like , well , let 's say it , it 's probably the biggest zoological discovery of the century . The century ? Forget it . History .
EARL: This is one big mother !
VAL: So this is the guy that had you seismos working overtime ?
EARL: Hey , Rhonda , you ever heard of u > anything like this before ?
VAL: Sure , Earl , everybody knows about them . We just did n't tell you . Come on , nobody 's ever seen one of these ! We 're really in on something here !
EARL: Pham Van do n't get his mitts on u > this for no measly fifteen bucks !
VAL: You got that right !
EARL: Here 's the plan we 'll get aa flatbed , I guess , with a big winch , figure a five ton anyway .
VAL: Naw , do n't want to winch it . That 'd tear it all up . Want to lift it . Some kind of crane with lifting straps . But Rhonda interrupts now really scared .
RHONDA: Hey , hey , shut up ! The way I figure it . There are five more of these things !
EARL: Five more ?
RHONDA: Yeah , darn it , look . I 've got seismographs all over the valley . If you compare the different eadings , there have to be five . Here 's one at two o'clock yesterday , but here 's another one three miles away at the same time . So that 's two . Now , here
VAL: We 'll take your word for it .
EARL: Yeah . Where 's your truck ?
RHONDA: The other side of that dome .
EARL: Prairie dog burrow
VAL: Little sons of bitches .
EARL: Well , at least the bastard ca n't climb . Pardon my French .
RHONDA: Probably could n't move too easily on the surface .
VAL: God , the live ones smell worse tan the dead ones .
EARL: Okay , now , how far 's your truck ?
VAL: I do n't know . If this one 's any faster than that other one
EARL: I think we wait right here .
RHONDA: There 's nothing like them in the fossil record , I 'm sureOkay , so they predate the fossil record That 'd make them a couple of illion years oldand we 've just never seen one till now . Right .
EARL: I 'd vote for outer space . No way those are local boys .
VAL: Atomic testing . Or , no , bio- engineering ! The government built them , a big surprise in the next war .
EARL: Wellhave n't seen a sign fo hours . Maybe it 's long gone .
VAL: Maybe it is . Why do n't you take a little stroll and see ?
EARL: Fuck you , too . Pardon my French .
RHONDA: Well , we 've got to do something .
EARL: Watch yourself ! It 's got a good six foot reach .
VAL: Son of a bitch !
EARL: Son of a goddamned bitch ! Been waiting there all this time . How the hell 's it even know we 're still here ?
VAL: It 's been listening to us . It 's got no eyes . It sure as hell ca n't smell anything underground , so I figure Rhonda stares at Val , impressed .
RHONDA: Of course ! It can sense the slightest seismic vibrationhea every move we make . Especially on this rock . It 's a perfect conductor .
EARL: You know , I hate to be crude , but I 'm gon na have to take care of some usiness here .
VAL: Me , too .
RHONDA: Same here .
VAL: No problem . Anytime .
EARL: Well , folks , what 's the plan ?
VAL: First let 's see if Stumpy 's still out there .
EARL: Do n't he have a home to go to ?
VAL: Well , that 's why Edgar never got down off that tower .
RHONDA: I might have an idea
EARL: We 're gon na have to come up with some kind of plan or it 's just gon na wait us to death .
RHONDA: Well , I was wondering if we could
VAL: Well , let 's just run for it . We outran that one yesterday , at least on a sprint .
EARL: Run for it ? Running 's not a plan . Running is what you do when the plan fails . You 're not even trying to come up with a plan !
VAL: Well , it 's not like we 've got a hell of a lot of options
RHONDA: You guys know how to pole vault ?
EARL: Stay on those residual boulders !
VAL: Think it 's still following us ?
RHONDA: Let 's assume that it is .
EARL: And once we hit that truck we got ta go fast . I say we all jump together .
RHONDA: Ready ?
VAL: Yeah . One , two , three
EARL: Come on , girl , it ai n't gon na give us much time
VAL: GO ! GO ! GO !
EARL: You go north , I 'll go south .
VAL: Right .
EARL: I 'll bet you 're sorry the college ever sent you up here .
RHONDA: Well , I 'm scared , but I 'm not sorry .
EARL: You know , Val went to that college , too . For a whole year . Could n't quite sit still for it , though . Had too much vinegar in his system . But once he settles down , forgets this cowboy stuff , he 'll be one in a million .
MIGUEL: You serious , Val ? You think we 're not even safe here in town ?
VAL: Ask me that after you meet one . I think we should all get the hell out while the getting 's good .
NESTOR: Why not just take a Number Ten pick axe and give it one good whack ?
VAL: Nestor , damn it , these things are igger than an Airstream trailer !
NANCY: God , I 've got to find Mindy . Nancy rushes out .
EARL: Hey , Pham , where 's Burt and Heather ?
PHAM VAN: Ca n't raise them . I guess they 're still out there somewhere .
RHONDA: If you 've got a radio , why are n't you calling somebody in Bixby ? The police or
PHAM VAN: Ca n't reach outside the valley . You know , because of the mountains .
MIGUEL: Hey , Rhonda , what 's the name you call those things , huh ?
PHAM VAN: Where 'd they come from ?
RHONDA: Huh ? I do n't know .
PHAM VAN: You 're a scientist , right ?
VIOLA: You should have a theory at least .
RHONDA: Look , these things are absolutely unprecedented !
NESTOR: Yeah , but where 'd they come from ?
RHONDA: Where 'd they come from ? Okay , worms , probably in the Jurassic period . Cosmic radiation was much higher thenso they mutatedand they got so big they just sank ight into the ground and fell asleep But now continental drift has brought them to the surface , eady to be harvested by the ancient alien meat growers who planted them here .
EARL: You 're right , do n't matter where they come from .
VAL: Right . We need to be talking about what we 're gon na do .
VIOLA: My goodness , Valentine , once they see the road is out and the phone lines are down , someone will be along to look in on us . Do n't you think ?
RHONDA: No no no , they listen ! They can sense the slightest vibration through the ground . That 's how they see ! That 's how they hunt !
MIGUEL: So , like we do n't vibrate , right ? Maybe they wo n't even come to here , huh ? Maybe they leave us alone .
VAL: They caught up with Edgar here . They grabbed Old Fred here . They nailed the asshole dog here . And the doctor 's place is here
EARL: You little ass wipe ! You knock that off or you 're gon na be shitting that basketball ! Pardon my French .
NESTOR: Now , Val , let 's assume they 're as dangerous as you say . Where are we going to go that 's safer than right here ?
VAL: Rhonda 's got an idea about that .
RHONDA: Yes , see , they move very easily through the Pleistocene Alluvials the dirtthe loose soil that makes up the valley floor . But they ca n't move through solid rock . I think we should travel west to the mountains .
EARL: You know , up the jeep trail .
RHONDA: The mountains are solid granite . We 'd be safe there , and we could hike along themall the way to Bixby if we have to .
NANCY: Mindy ! Mindy !
EARL: I 'm gon na kick his ass !
VAL: I 'm gon na help you .
MIGUEL: Jesus Christ ! Man , you gut a gun ? !
PHAM VAN: Big as a house ! What are we gon na do ? !
RHONDA: Quiet ! QUIET ! !
NANCY: Mindy ! Mindy !
MINDY: Oww ! Val , you hurt me !
VAL: Go back , for chrissake ! Rhonda and Earl hesitate .
EARL: We got ta get him off there . It 'll suck that truck down !
VAL: Come on ! Outta your pants !
EARL: Come on ! Come on ! Do n't look back ! Just run ! Run like screaming fuck !
VAL: You paying attention ? This oughta hurt like hell .
RHONDA: It does . She smiles at him . RHONDA So , is that one of your usual jobs , saving peoples ' lives ?
VAL: First time for me .
RHONDA: Oh , thank you .
MIGUEL: So what are we gon na do , you know ? How long till they go away ?
EARL: They got the patience of Job . They just sit and goddamn wait til they hear something that sounds like lunch . We need a plan .
PHAM VAN: I 've got a plan . You and Val take your truck , get to the mountains . Hike to Bixby . Get us some help .
VAL: Those scumsuckers are my radials , Pham !
RHONDA: Well , we can take my truck then .
EARL: No good . You need major four- wheel-drive just to get up that jeep trail .
VAL: Chuck him out the door ! Like a little hors d'oeuvre .
RHONDA: Oh my God .
EARL: Son of a bitchin ' lowlife , putrid , scum
VAL: Got ta do something . Got ta get the astards !
MIGUEL: Man , what the hell can we do to those things ?
EARL: Well , we 're sure as hell not going to sit here being quiet for God knows how long . Are we ?
PHAM VAN: Now wait a minute , Earl . I got enough food here to last us fo weeks . Those damn things ca n't wait around forever . We can do it . I mean , if we have to , right ?
EARL: Jesus ! Shut it off !
VAL: Son of a bitch ! Son of a bitch !
MELVIN: Hey ! What 's going on , man ? ! What the hell you doing up there ? !
MIGUEL: Melvin , shut the hell up !
VAL: Nancy ! Nestor !
EARL: Ca n't you shout a little quieter ?
HEATHER: I ca n't believe it . No tracks , no sign , no spoor .
BURT: Yeah , whatever they are , you 'd think after they ate all those sheep they 'd have to take a dump someplace What the hell 's going on in town ?
EARL: Hey , here 's the plan Nestor 's Cadillac . His tires are nine hundred sixteens . We sprint fo it , grab the spare , put it on ou truck with our spare . Val stares at him , incredulous .
VAL: How the hell long it take you to change a tire ?
EARL: Just about too damn long . Bolt pattern 's probably wrong anyway .
VAL: We need another plan .
BURT: Negative copy on that , Pham , check your frequency . I 'm on forty-nine .
MIGUEL: Oh man , they 're going , man ! I think they 're going for Burt !
VAL: Burt ! This is Val ! Get out of your basement ! ! Take your radio ! You and Heather get up on you oof ! Then we 'll talk , okay ? !
BURT: We do n't see anything , Val . Now what the hell are you talking about ? Over .
VAL: Uhroger that , Burt . Uh , congratulations . Uh , be advised , however , there are four more , epeat , four more motherfuckers . Come back .
MELVIN: Way to go , dudes !
EARL: Well , I guess we do n't get to make fun of Burt 's lifestyle anymore , huh ? Val grabs the CB mic .
VAL: Burt , any chance you can get the est of them ?
BURT: One second , Val .
HEATHER: You 're not getting any penetration , even with the elephant gun .
BURT: Damn ! Val , we ca n't get them . Neve figured on having to shoot through dirt ! Best goddamn bullet stop there is . Come back .
EARL: Okay , Burt , listen . Forget shooting them . Tell me this can you get to your truck ?
RHONDA: Hey , guys ! They 're up to something .
VAL: What 's it doing ?
RHONDA: Why do you all keep asking me ?
MIGUEL: Hey , there 's another one coming !
EARL: What the hell was that all about ?
MIGUEL: They were n't making no noise . Why they bothering them for ?
VAL: They 're studying the buildings trying to figure them out . Rhonda chimes in from the water tower .
RHONDA: Yeah , they 're confused . They can feel our vibrations , but they ca n't find us .
VAL: They 're working together , too .
EARL: Yeah , like they got a plan
MELVIN: Oh , wow , man ! No way ! No fucking way , man !
VAL: They knocked his place down on purpose , man . They 're gon na tea this whole town out from under us !
HEATHER: Yeah , Val .
BURT: I think I scared it !
HEATHER: We 're here , Val . Just tell us what you need . Come back .
VAL: Yeah , Heather , we got you .
MELVIN: Hey , you better think of something , man ! You got ta do something !
EARL: Who ?
MELVIN: You and Val , man !
VAL: What ? ! ! Since when the hell 's every goddamn thing up to us ? !
RHONDA: You guys do all the odd jobs . Val just stares at her .
EARL: We do n't have a hell of a lot of time here .
RHONDA: Look , the situation has n't changed . We still have to get to solid rock . There must be some way !
VAL: Like what ? ! There 's nothing left that 'll make it to the mountains !
MIGUEL: Hey , Val , quiet , man !
VAL: We need a helicopter is what we need , or a goddamn tank
EARL: Wait a minutethe Cat . Could we take the Cat ?
VAL: Jesus . It 's slower than hell .
EARL: Yeah , but it weighs better than thirty tons . No way they could stop it .
MIGUEL: We ca n't all fit on that bulldozer . But Val is warming to the idea .
VAL: Butwe could pull something ! We could , I do n't know , drag a ca ehind it !
EARL: A car , huh ? Like a big armored car ? Need something bigger , tougherour truck maybeor , hell , that old semi trailer !
VAL: Its tires are flat
EARL: Does n't matter . The cat can pull u > anything .
VAL: Wellall right ! We just roll on out of here !
EARL: We got a plan !
RHONDA: Listen , they only respond to vibration , right ? Could n't we distract them somehow ?
VAL: Yeah , good ! Something to keep them usy . We need a decoy .
EARL: Hey , Melvin , you wan na make a buck ?
MELVIN: Fuck you !
MIGUEL: Hey , how about the tractor ? Start him up . Let him go by itself . Let those things chase it all over is they like that noise .
EARL: Not bad . What do you think ?
VAL: I think the ground 's getting closer . I think we do it . We 're gon na save our asses here !
RHONDA: Wait ! How are you going to know they 're all following it ?
VAL: Good point .
EARL: We got two right here .
NANCY: There 's one . I think one .

VAL: Come on , Burt , we ca n't hold still long . They 're damn smart and getting smarter by the minute . Burt hefts the finished bomb .
BURT: That 's fine . We 've got some new things to teach them .
VAL: Damn it ! They 'll sink this rig just like a boat !
EARL: See that ? They 're doing it now ! They try it every time we hold still .
VAL: Jesus Christ , we 're only going nine miles . Be there in two hours , tops !

HEATHER: I 'd go for penetration . The 458 shooting solids less ammo to carry anyway .
TOWNSFOLK: Come on ! Who cares ! Forget it ! Let 's go !
MELVIN: Give me a gun ! I 'll take one !

VAL: Well , it just suddenly hit me , you know ? Stampede ?
MINDY: Look !
EARL: Road 's in !
VAL: Road 's in ! Now , soon as we hit Bixby we start making phone calls . We could make some real money off this whole thing , get in People < /u magazine
VAL: Sell the movie rights . We 're going straight from blue-collar to white -collar .
EARL: Yeahbut no ties .
VAL: No ties .
RHONDA: Hi , guys . Burt loaned me his camera .

RHONDA: Wellsee ya .
EARL: Christ , Val , maybe she 's not you type , but you could , at least , be civil .
VAL: Civil ? I 'm civil .
EARL: You 're not civil , you 're glum . We got the world by the tail with a downhill pull and all of a sudden you go glum on me . Earl freezes as a bell goes off in his head . EARL Oh my God . She got to you . You do < /u like her !
VAL: Somebody paying you to do this ?
EARL: She just practically asked you fo a date . What the hell is wrong ? ! Val glares at Earl for a moment .
VAL: Earl , get real . What does she need with a guy like me ? Earl is dumbfounded .
EARL: What was that ? All this time she 's not good enough for you . Now , suddenly , you 're not good enough fo her ? God , my work is never done . u > You do n't decide is you 're worthless , she does . But you got ta give her a chance ! Val lowers the jack letting the truck down .

EARL: Fine , make the mistakes I did . I think I 'll just be playing this hand myself .
VAL: What ?
EARL: She likes both of us . We both helped her out .

EARL: Oh yeah ? Think about this She ai n't as narrow-minded as you . I 'll lay odds she 's looking fo character in a man . For my part , I 'd be proud to have her . I 'd goddamn worship her . Earl hops into the truck . EARL I 'm going out there right now , help her take those picturesset up he seismo-jiggers . Whatever she wants . Who the hell knows what 'll happen ?
ARAGON: A year younger than I was for my first .

ARAGON: a stag ?
TRISTAN: Oh come on !
ARAGON: Because someone has to stand up to them .
TRISTAN: You ?
ARAGON: Me , Marke , all the tribes . We can ’ t esist alone .
TRISTAN: I could .
ARAGON: Oh my little warrior . We have to be careful .
TRISTAN: Can I ?
MAN: The Angles have arrives my Lord , as well as the Carrods , our fellow Jutes and the Saxons .
ARAGON: Good . With Marke , all will be here .
MAN: Yeah . It is a great day .
ARAGON: Let us hope so .
TRISTAN: Thanks .
LADY MARKE: We heard the news
TRISTAN: Mother , I made this for you
ARAGON: Friends , look at us .
LORD: But who would be King ?
ARAGON: The strongest among us Lord Marke .
BARON: If we were happy doing that then we would never have risked coming here .
MARKE: Friends . My wife is with child , my heart tells me it is a boy . I want him to grow old in a land where all of us , all the tribes Pict , Celt , Angle , Jute , Saxon are at peace . This island has not known unity since the Romans left . That is why I sign this treaty .
WICTRED: And why should we follow you ?
MARKE: Perhaps , Wictred , because your last attempt to form an alliance without the knowledge of half the Barons in this room has failed .
MAN: My Lord ! The Irish are here !
ARAGON: Take all your men . Guard the women !
MARKE: But you
ARAGON: Go ! ! !
LADY MARKE: Tristan ! Hurry ! Come this way .
BARON: How did they know ?
LADY MARKE: Tristan !
BRAGNAE: She ’ s with the Gods now Isolde , you ’ ll see her again someday .
ISOLDE: Will I ?
HENCHMAN: Morholt returns .
KING DONNCHADH: What news of the treaty ?
BRAGNAE: Your mother loved you so much Isolde
ISOLDE: Why did she die Bragnae ? Why ?
BRAGNAE: It was an ill fever that took her . Fever .
ISOLDE: No . It was her heart .
MARKE: Your husband ?
EDYTH: Who ’ s this ?
MARKE: Tristan . Son of Aragon . We ’ re his family now .
EDYTH: I have a son about your age . Melot ! Melot ! Melot , this is Tristan .
HENCHMAN: What shall we do , my Lord ?
MARKE: Rebuild .
BOY: Tristan won ’ t fight me ! Look he ’ s scared !
MARKE: Still wo n't fight ?
GENERAL: Tristan has the heart of a lion.He just needs some time .
MELOT: Why did you take off your helmet ? You going to cry ? My father died too , but you don ’ t see me crying !
EDYTH: Melot !
MELOT: Run ! Find another trapdoor to hide under . Coward !
HENCHMAN: Tristan !
SAMMY: Tristan ! Tristan ! We ’ ve found something ! Come on , this way .
MELOT: You will love it .
SIMON: I found a trapdoor !
MELOT: You found a trapdoor ? Alright Simon , will you tell us all how you found it ? ! Look at that !
TRISTAN: Where does this lead ?
MELOT: You ’ ll see . I like that vase , I think I 'll have that . I always knew the Castle was built on Roman foundations but we didn ’ t think anything was left !
TRISTAN: Must be a burial crypt or something .
MELOT: Here we are the bottom of the keep .
TRISTAN: Who else knows about this ?
SAMMY: Nobody .
TRISTAN: Good .
BODKIN: The savages have rebuilt the castle at Cornwall , only now it ’ s made of stone .
KING DONNCHADH: Of Cornwall ’ s next tribute I want slaves . Young ones . Their future . If Marke resists have Morholt crush him .
MORHOLT: My King .
KING DONNCHADH: Morholt .
MORHOLT: I have led your armies to victory fa and near . I ’ v made you rich and powerful .
KING DONNCHADH: Yes you have . You have been most loyal .
MORHOLT: When I return from Cornwall , I was hoping
KING DONNCHADH: What would please you ?
MORHOLT: A wife .
BRAGNAE: It ’ s dark in an hour .
ISOLDE: What do you think is really out there ?
BRAGNAE: Britannia . The old Roman lands . Full of evil and grief .
ISOLDE: I want to see it . Do you know what the future looks like Bragnae ?
BRAGNAE: I see the life you were meant for . You father will speak with you .
ISOLDE: Am I just a chattel to be traded at your pleasure ? Do I have no say in my own life ?
KING DONNCHADH: You have a duty to your King .
ISOLDE: You are my father .
KING DONNCHADH: Then obey me , daughter .
MORHOLT: Your father has given you the news ?
ISOLDE: I accept it .
MORHOLT: You know , we are more alike than you might guess .
ISOLDE: How so ?
MORHOLT: I too dabble in elixirs . Poison from the livers of a puffer fish . Just a taste paralyses all the senses . So if the blade doesn ’ t kill
ISOLDE: Rendered safe by thistle and bark .
MORHOLT: And you know the antidote for this ?
ISOLDE: Yohimbine .
MORHOLT: Makes a hard man even harder . The only cure wild abandon . Till out wedding day . I ’ m to Cornwall , to deal with rabbles .
BODKIN: Release them .
CORNISH MAN: Leave her !
BODKIN: Take him there . Get a rope . Any man foolish enough to interfere in any way shall suffer the same fate .
GIRL: No ! No ! Please No !
BODKIN: If there are any more attacks we shall put our guests to death and raise this entire land . Take the horses .
MARKE: When would you strike ?
TRISTAN: At once . Throw everything we have at them .
MARKE: They are hoping you 'll do that . On horse they outnumber us two to one . You would lead the men straight to their deaths .
TRISTAN: So we do nothing ? !
MARKE: Donnchadh would like that even more . Me to lose face in front of the othe tribes . No , we must act . We must be decisive but we can not act alone .
WICTRED: My men don ’ t want to follow a Pict into attle . Let alone one leading a pack of Angles and Celts .
MARKE: Then why are you here ?
WICTRED: I thought Tristan should let me command his men .
TRISTAN: I make it my habit to follow no one .
WICTRED: Except Marke .
TRISTAN: Marke delivered me from that place when I was a boy . You ran . So you can understand that when I think of Kings I think of him . When I think of cowards
MARKE: They are one day from their boats on the old Roman road . Now who will ride out with Tristan to fight them ?
LORD: What is your plan , Tristan ?
TRISTAN: We will need our two fastest runners .
IRISH MAN: Go around !
BODKIN: Morholt , they ’ re back !
MORHOLT: Kill the slaves !
TRISTAN: Simon !
SAMMY: I don ’ t want to die .
MAN: Tristan !
TRISTAN: I can ’ t feel my legs or my hands .
MAN: Poison .
TRISTAN: Build a second boat .
MAN: Tristan !
MELOT: He shall have a King 's service .
MARKE: Tristan ?
MELOT: Simon too .
MARKE: Did I love him like a son or did I misuse him for my own purposes ?
EDYTH: He knew . He knew .
BRAGNAE: Where are we going ?
ISOLDE: Away .
BRAGNAE: You 're afflicted child . Speak to me ! Your father will find us and have my head . You are my charge . Please !
ISOLDE: I am no ones charge !
BRAGNAE: You are . And you will be Morholt ’ s Lady !
ISOLDE: And live a loveless life like my mam ?
BRAGNAE: What ’ s that ?
ISOLDE: Where ?
BRAGNAE: Isolde . Wait ! Don ’ t ! Isolde . Don ’ t ! Isolde !
ISOLDE: It ’ s a man .
BRAGNAE: Dead ?
ISOLDE: Alive ! Bragnae help me !
BRAGNAE: Isolde ?
ISOLDE: Help me !
BRAGNAE: What are you doing ?
ISOLDE: He needs heat . Now ! Get your clothes off ! Quickly !
BRAGNAE: I ’ ve not been naked with a man fo 15 years !
ISOLDE: Hello . You 've been sleeping a long time . You 're in Ireland . Did you know that ? Shh It 's alright . You 're safe here . No one knows . Do n't be scared . Just sleep sleep .
BRAGNAE: Nooo Nooo Noo !
ISOLDE: It ’ s alright , you don ’ t need that ! I forgot to tell him about you
BRAGNAE: I ’ ll wait outside with the other beasts .
TRISTAN: You said no one else knew .
ISOLDE: Sorry She ’ s My maid . Sworn to silence . Um lie down please . Please ?
TRISTAN: Why are you doing this ?
ISOLDE: I ’ ll be back
BRAGNAE: This is a dangerous game you are playing . He ’ s English , Isolde .
ISOLDE: Then we ’ ve got him prisoner .
BRAGNAE: Under no circumstances tell him you name , you hear me ? Not if you wish him to escape this place . Do you hear me ?
KING DONNCHADH: You ’ ve been away .
ISOLDE: I had noticed . Yes I have a bit .
KING DONNCHADH: Where ?
ISOLDE: Bragnae and I were spying the convent of Brittes ] .
KING DONNCHADH: Seeking sanctuary ?
ISOLDE: Some women need it .
KING DONNCHADH: You ’ ll find no refuge in a new religion . Your place is here , with Morholt .
ISOLDE: Any word of my betrothed ?
KING DONNCHADH: Overdue . But comforted no doubt that you yearn for him .
TRISTAN: What 's your name ?
ISOLDE: Oh , I think it 's better if we do n't other with names .
TRISTAN: How can I thank you if I do n't have your name ?
ISOLDE: You just did . If you insist my name is Bragnae . I 'm a lady in waiting at the court . My parents are dead . My mother , she is the source of the kindness you find so puzzling . My father would 've left you where you fell .
TRISTAN: Tristan of Aragon .
ISOLDE: Well Tristan of Aragon , I 'd guess about you too , but I think I 've already seen everything .
BRAGNAE: Sir ! I hope you appreciate the risks we are taking , and will honour us by leaving as soon as you are able .
TRISTAN: She likes me . She ’ s right though , you do risk .
ISOLDE: There . What of your parents ?
TRISTAN: They also died when I was a child .
ISOLDE: Of what ?
TRISTAN: A different type of Irish kindness .
ISOLDE: Sorry .
TRISTAN: Tomorrow .
ISOLDE: There she who bore you brought you forth .
TRISTAN: Ridiculous .
ISOLDE: I happen to believe what that says . Don ’ t you think there is more to life ?
TRISTAN: Than what ?
ISOLDE: Something more than duty and death ! Why are we capable of feelings if not to have them ? Why long for things if they are not meant to be ours ? Well don ’ t listen to me . You ’ re so sure of things . You ’ re certainty , it ’ s like armour . I wish I had that .
TRISTAN: Why would you need it ?
ISOLDE: The joy of being a lady ? Wanting something I can ’ t have . A life of my own .
BRAGNAE: Time for sleep now .
ISOLDE: I ’ ll follow you later .
BRAGNAE: You need to rest . In case your betrothed should want to see you .
TRISTAN: You ’ re promised ?
ISOLDE: Yes .
TRISTAN: What ’ s he like ?
ISOLDE: Dark . Tall . Nearly twice your size . An absolute gentleman .
TRISTAN: I thought earlier when you spoke of wanting something you can ’ t have .
ISOLDE: I didn ’ t know what I was talking about .
TRISTAN: How do you feel ?
ISOLDE: I don ’ t know
TRISTAN: Come with me . Come with me !
ISOLDE: I can ’ t
TRISTAN: Why not ? Please !
ISOLDE: Tristan , we ’ ve both known this can ’ t e. We ’ ve known this from the start . That doesn ’ t mean it isn ’ t true . It is . It just can not be . I want to know that you are alive somewhere thinking of me from time to time . I want to know that there is more to this life and I can ’ t know that if they kill you . Please ?
KING DONNCHADH: A Cornish warrior may be ashore . Beware . We seek him as I speak . Hopefully it is just his rotted corpse we 'll find , for he has slain your betrothed . Morholt is dead . Fallen in battle . Isolde ? Bragnae , comfort her .
BODKIN: She ’ s stunned .
KING DONNCHADH: As am I by her grief .
BODKIN: We should assulat the British straight away . Crush them with maximum force .
KING DONNCHADH: Maximum force . Like that of Marke ’ s tribe with the maximum force you speak of ? I will not confront them again until our numbers are refreshed . Until then , we ’ ll have cunning divide them .
BODKIN: Of what nature ?
KING DONNCHADH: A prize , perhaps .
MELOT: What ’ s this about a tournament ?
MARKE: Donnchadh . He has offered his daughte and the lands of Lyonesse as dowry to whichever English tribe wins . It is a clever way of setting us against each other .
MELOT: Well , the other barons will see through that .
WICTRED: As baron of Wessex it is my duty to fight in this tournament for my people .
MARKE: For yourself you mean .
MELOT: And what of the support you promised Tristan ?
WICTRED: Tristan is dead . My people have suffered enough . They see the wealth of Lyonesse as more real than any alliance . My mind is set .
BARON: And ours as well .
MARKE: So be it .
MELOT: You 're weary , let me rally your friends . I ’ ll lead them against D
MARKE: Ah , Melot , Melot , Melot . You are my lood and you are a noble presence but
GUARD: Lord Marke ! He ’ s back ! It ’ s Tristan !
MAN: It can not be !
EDYTH: Tristan !
MELOT: I saw you dead .
TRISTAN: I am delivered .
MARKE: How ? How ?
MAN: Tristan . The Irish King offers his daughte in tournament to divide the tribes . For the power and the wealth half the tribes have sent champions to fight at the Tristan !
ISOLDE: `` My face in thine eyes , thine in mine appears ,
MARKE: What ?
TRISTAN: It is the only way to keep the alliance alive .
MARKE: I fail to see how fighting with ou partners keeps us allies .
TRISTAN: Well they are all going to the tournament anyway . By announcing you will share the dowry with every Baron that remains loyal and in turn offering to support whomever prevails , the others would e compelled to follow you when you win .
MARKE: If we win . If we lose we could end up following Wictred . I ’ d need an infallible champion !
TRISTAN: Me .
MARKE: You are not yet healed .
TRISTAN: Then this trip will be my tonic . I will e ready . I know I will .
MARKE: What is the source of this fervour ?
TRISTAN: Let me go and win you a wife . She can make peace without spilling one drop of blood , and maybe heal a wound from which you still lack .
BODKIN: Truce . You have safe passage .
TRISTAN: How do I look ?
HENCHMAN: How do you look ?
MELOT: Where is this Princess ? What ’ s her name ? Isolde ? I want to see what she looks like .
BRAGNAE: There . Almost done .
ISOLDE: No , not quite . If I am to be a present I should be fully wrapped .
KING DONNCHADH: See how the bees come to the honey .
TRISTAN: Tristan of Aragon .
KING DONNCHADH: So he lives .
BODKIN: For the moment .
WICTRED: Wictred of Glastonbury .
BODKIN: Why Wictred ?
KING DONNCHADH: Because the Barons will never unite ehind him .
MELOT: Do you think she ’ s got the pox ?
HERALD: Since the dawn of time
WICTRED’S OPPONENT: Make it for real !
WICTRED: What ?
WICTRED’S OPPONENT: I yield !
MAN: You were great !
KING DONNCHADH: Allow it !
MELOT: It was too easy for you Tristan . Not much for a third draw .
WICTRED: Mace .
MELOT: One more fight Tristan . Take deep breaths .
HERALD: Wictred Lord of Saxonberg . Tristan Champion of Cornwall . Warriors Begin !
TRISTAN: Yield !
KING DONNCHADH: An impressive victory . Of course the man who defeats Morholt might be expected to triumph here .
TRISTAN: On behalf of Cornwall , I offer you daughter a place on our throne . The throne of England , united behind one leader .
KING DONNCHADH: Isolde ! Perhaps it is just that he who took a husband provides one .
ISOLDE: I ’ m yours .
KING DONNCHADH: No . Tristan of Aragon has won you on ehalf of Lord Marke of Cornwall .
MELOT: Let ’ s go .
KING DONNCHADH: Let them take her across the sea . Afte the wedding I 'll disavow Isolde , the alliance will crumble .
HENCHMAN: Tristan . Princess wants to speak to you .
ISOLDE: You risked your life to give me to anothe man .
TRISTAN: You said your name was Bragnae . Why did you do that ?
ISOLDE: Oh what have I done ? Stop this thing . Say something .
TRISTAN: I ca n't . I won you in my King 's name .
ISOLDE: But I am yours . You touched me and I yielded
TRISTAN: It does n't matter .
ISOLDE: It is the only thing that matters Tristan . Leave with me , I will go anywhere .
TRISTAN: Your marriage will end a hundred years of bloodshed .
ISOLDE: My marriage to another man !
TRISTAN: Isolde . You will live with this . We must .
ISOLDE: Do n't do this to me .
MELOT: Tristan , we ’ ve made shore .
MARKE: What if she ’ s a hag ? Or maybe she won ’ t have me !
EDYTH: She will brother . You ’ re the prize .
ISOLDE: My Lord .
MARKE: Isolde ? Welcome .
ISOLDE: If things were different . If we lived in a place without duty would you e with me ?
TRISTAN: That place does not exist .
ISOLDE: I 'll pretend it 's you .
MARKE: You ’ re trembling . You are far from home and I am a stranger still . But you mustn ’ t fear me . My wish is to make you happy , as a wife.. as a women and hopefully one day , the fact that I am not whole will not offend you .
ISOLDE: It was a present .
MAN: Tristan ?
TRISTAN: Might I stay here a while ?
MAN: Of course .
EDYTH: Tristan !
MARKE: I ’ ve never seen him like this before .
ISOLDE: Perhaps someone his own age should speak with him .
TRISTAN: I can tell . Laughing at the market , holding hands , a caress on the neck when he pours you wine .
ISOLDE: He is my husband . I remember his Kingdom comes before my life .
TRISTAN: Yes well , I must confess I thought you might find more difficulties in performing your duty .
ISOLDE: Am I not permitted a single moment without mourning ? Living with this Tristan as you said we must .
TRISTAN: I live in torture thinking of these moments . With every look he gives you I get sicker and sicker . There is a urning in me , I feel on fire and guilt and I ca n't get rid of either . Does it make you happy to know that ?
ISOLDE: The Roman Bridge . I can get to it without eing seen . And I will go there anytime to be there with you .
MARKE: Welcome bands of Anglia , Rothgar and Orick . Wessex Kaye and Wictred .
WICTRED: As you will be King and his daughte Queen , does that mean Donnchadh will e coming to the coronation .
MARKE: It does . On the next full moon , all will attend .
WICTRED: A lot can happen in a month
MARKE: Bearing that in mind , and given the instabilities of our new land I shall e naming a second . My sister has raised one , capable of guiding you if the need should arise . He is a man of passion , fierce in battle who has learnt to tame his heart with his head . I give you Tristan of Aragon .
TRISTAN: I can ’ t be your second . Melot must be . He is blood . Besides , I wish to journey north .
MARKE: You no longer sleep at Dor , and now you don ’ t want to be my second . Do you find no comfort in your home ? These stone walls that you helped build ?
TRISTAN: I find these walls a prison .
MARKE: Why ?
TRISTAN: Everything I want seems misplaced .
MARKE: Ever since you were a boy you sacrificed everything for me . All for one dream . Now that you reached that dream , it is natural that you would feel some loss . It doesn ’ t matter if you want to be second . You are . I will only be king if you are my second . I ’ d put it more gently if I could .
TRISTAN: Then I am your second .
MARKE: Perhaps it is time that you took a wife !
TRISTAN: No !
MARKE: Can ’ t live alone forever .
TRISTAN: I can !
MARKE: Isolde . I was trying to explain to Tristan the importance of loving . It seems he might live without it .
ISOLDE: Why ?
TRISTAN: There are other things to live for . Duty . Honour .
ISOLDE: But they are not life Tristan . They are the shells of life . And empty ones and in the end all they hold is days and days without love . Love is made y God . Ignore it and you can suffe as you can not imagine .
TRISTAN: Then I will no longer live without it .
MARKE: Good . Very good ! Come , we will be late !
ISOLDE: Late ?
MARKE: The warriors ride out on the full moon . It is an old ritual . I shall miss you tonight .
ISOLDE: How many did you love before me ?
TRISTAN: None .
ISOLDE: And after me ?
TRISTAN: None .
MAN: Lord Marke ! Are you hurt ?
MARKE: Nothing but for my pride .
MELOT: Tristan , I need to speak with you .
TRISTAN: Go ahead .
MELOT: We haven ’ t even had a coronation yet to mark tradition . But now he breaks tradition and scares all the barons y naming you as second .
TRISTAN: I tried to convince him you would be etter .
MELOT: Yes well , peace can be just as treacherous as war and I feel that Marke doesn ’ t eallyListen to me ! ! ! Our attention must be on Cornwall now more than ever .
TRISTAN: I am sorry he didn ’ t choose you . I am .
MELOT: Can I speak to you ?
ISOLDE: What do you think became of them ?
TRISTAN: They were lives just lived .
ISOLDE: I find myself imaging things in this place . I decorate it . Books , a harp there a child .
TRISTAN: Would it be his or mine ?
ISOLDE: I would have no way to tell , would I ? He is a kind man Tristan , I can not hate him . Yesterday at the market I saw a couple holding hands , and I realised we would never do that . Never anything like it . No picnics or unguarded smiles . No rings . Just stolen moments that leave too quickly .
MARKE: Where is Isolde ?
BRAGNAE: I don ’ t know for sure , she was having a walk in the garden before and I ’ m afraid I got tired so I returned . It ’ s my fault .
TRISTAN: There is another door here , forgotten . This comes up in the bottom chambe of the keep .
ISOLDE: I hate this .
TRISTAN: Hurry ! Go on .
BRAGNAE: I ’ m tired of this . I ’ m tired of lying for you . I ’ m sick of it .
ISOLDE: Then don ’ t .
MARKE: I didn ’ t ask you were you were . You heart is beating so fast .
ISOLDE: Is it ?
MARKE: Isolde . Is there anything I can do to make you happier . I want to make you happy .
ISOLDE: I ’ m fine .
WICTRED: She ’ s in love with Tristan . They ’ re intimates . If I expose them it will eak Marke ’ s heart and his hold on the other Barons .
KING DONNCHADH: How ?
WICTRED: With Marke ’ s champion in chains , we ’ ll take Castle Dor . You can man your armies unopposed . There will be no one defending you in the waters .
KING DONNCHADH: And your price ?
WICTRED: I want Marke ’ s throne .
KING DONNCHADH: When his throne falls apart , we ’ ll go over and pick up the pieces .
MARKE: Tristan ? Can I speak with you ? Is it possible do you think a man blinded y love Is it possible that that man might not see treachery right in front of him ?
TRISTAN: No .
MARKE: Perhaps you could follow her . I can ’ t ask anyone else . I know . I know what you think – I ’ m acting like a child . Normally I can read faces , but with hers I feel like I ca n't be objective . She ’ s so delicate .
TRISTAN: You really love her .
MARKE: Oh I doterribly . I didn ’ t know how empty I was . She sustains me , she thrills me . And when I see this ring , it is a ring of thorns .
TRISTAN: The ring is nothing . She 's loyal to you . I am sure of it .
MARKE: If you say so .
MAN: I count nine
TRISTAN: If they move they will warn us with a black flag
MARKE: You bring an entourage ?
KING DONNCHADH: I can let myself be alone in my position Lord Marke . But don ’ t worry , they will stay offshore . I miss you .
MARKE: My nephew , Merlot of Cornwall
KING DONNCHADH: And Tristan , slayer of my best general , winner of Isolde , defender of the alliance . You are a fortunate man .
MARKE: Indeed .
WICTRED: May I dance with the Queen , or does Tristan have the next one ?
MARKE: That ’ s right , you have never danced with Isolde before !
WICTRED: A new song for Tristan . Slow .
ISOLDE: Why did you burn it ?
TRISTAN: You know .
ISOLDE: Meet me there in an hour or I ’ ll die .
MARKE: I could still teach you a thing or two , dancing being one of them .
KAYE: Accuse him now .
WICTRED: No , no , no . We ’ ll have more than accusations .
MARKE: Is something the matter ?
ISOLDE: I ’ m just feeling a little weary that ’ s all . I might just go and have a lie down .
MARKE: Of course .
WICTRED: Friends , friends hear me ! We ’ ve forgotten the full moon isn ’ t it time to ride out ?
GENERAL: No . Tonight it cause for exception .
WICTRED: But the coronation should uphold tradition , surely it is not to be neglected already ?
MARKE: We honour it . In half a night . Ride out ! Where ’ s Tristan ?
ISOLDE: I miss Ireland
TRISTAN: Isolde , this must end .
ISOLDE: That ’ s like asking me to stop breathing .
TRISTAN: It can not be .
ISOLDE: Please don ’ t leave me . Please !
MARKE: Isolde ? There is someone No .
KING DONNCHADH: I see how it is in Cornwall . My money is good enough , my alliance is good enough , but my daughter you pass amoung your lieutenants like a whore !
ISOLDE: It ’ s not like that .
KING DONNCHADH: I see no relation to me here ! I will see this peace end .
WICTRED: You have brought the allegiance to shame . Who would fight for this ?
MARKE: Seize him . Seize him .
MELOT: Behold your hero uncle I would have no heroes now .
BODKIN: They ’ re ashore .
KING DONNCHADH: Prove your worth .
BARON: If a man can ’ t rule his woman , how can he govern an entire Kingdom ?
MELOT: He can ’ t .
LORD: We have suffered peace .
BARON: It ’ s all been coming apart . I can feel it
LORD: You ’ re right .
WICTRED: There is very little time . Fortunately , Donnchadh has no quarrel with anybody here . He ’ s asked me to give you a message .
BARON: What ’ s this ?
WICTRED: It is compensation for the men you will lose attacking Castle Dor with Donnchadh tomorrow . Let ’ s be honest , our people need a stronger leader .
BARON: And who might that be , Wictred ?
WICTRED: Melot . Too long the ablest amoung us has been denied his rightful place . I pledge you my legiance and offer him my services as his second .
MELOT: I like this plan .
MARKE: I came to apologise . I ’ ve been selfish arrogantly thinking that perhaps I ’ d given enough . At least enough to merit if not your love then at least you espect . You have a home . A kingdom . Why was it not enough ? Tell me . Tell me ! You do not know what you have done ! Everything is destroyed , everything ! All because you did not have enough . She ’ s loyal to you I am sure of it . You bloodsucker . What could it had been had I not stretched out my hand to save your life . How I curse that day , how I curse it . And so be with your defence . Then I will go complete your punishment , Donnchadh marches on us as we speak .
BRAGNAE: She ’ s young . I will not let you harm her !
MARKE: How long ?
ISOLDE: Since you thought he was dead . I found him wounded on the beach in Ireland . I hid him from my father and I told him my name was Bragnae . So when he came to the tournament at Dunluce to win Donnchadh ’ s daughter he didn ’ t realise it was me . All this time my heart has een his , and I am sorry . He tried harde than you can possibly imagine because he loves you .
MELOT: I will coax him out , make sure Donnchadh knows this .
WICTRED: Of course , of course . You know as things moved along I suspected them for some time .
MERLOT: Tristan and Isolde ?
WICTRED: You know what I could never work out ? How it was conducted . How she got in and out of Dor unseen .
MERLOT: The tunnel .
WICTRED: What ?
MERLOT: The Roman Tunnel !
WICTRED: Show me .
TRISTAN: What is this ?
HENCHMAN: The will of the King . Farwell .
ISOLDE: I told him about Ireland . He ’ s given us our freedom . Why does loving you feel so wrong ?
TRISTAN: Get in .
ISOLDE: Tristan , if I do this .
TRISTAN: For all time , they will say it was ou love that brought down a kingdom . Remembe us .
ISOLDE: Tristan , don ’ t ! Tristan ! Tristan ! Tristan ! Why ? ! Tristan !
MARKE: Get the livestock and fuel undercover . Put some archers on the ramparts .
GENERAL: All the archers have deserted us as has half the household .
MARKE: And you stay ?
MAN: If you are surprised then they have won already .
GENERAL: Come on , hurry !
KING DONNCHADH: Burn it . Their will is as strong as milk . The seas will unravel us . Where is Wictred with his key ?
MELOT: It comes up to the Roman foundations at the lowest level .
WICTRED: This is a godsend !
MELOT: That he will not make any more mistakes and that it is time for him to move a – what ’ s that ? !
MAN: Aim for the front of the line
MARKE: They are waiting .
MAN: The Irish are inside !
MARKE: Follow me !
WICTRED: Bar the door make sure no one gets in !
MELOT: You .
TRISTAN: What happened here ?
MELOT: A reward for idiocy . A dozen Irish have lazed your way .
TRISTAN: Melot , I came to aid Marke .
MELOT: Everyone lies .
TRISTAN: I didn ’ t lead them here .
MELOT: No , I did .
TRISTAN: Why ?
MELOT: I thought someone believed in me .
TRISTAN: It will be undone .
MELOT: Tristan—I ’ m for the worms—swear to me that you are true .
TRISTAN: As we were brothers .
MELOT: Build my boat .
WICTREDS MAN: They ’ re here !
WICTRED: Keep them back .
MARKE’S MAN: Wictred .
MARKE: He ’ s trying to lower the bridge
MARKE’S MAN: Traitor !
MARKE: Give me your shield , we ’ re pinned down !
MARKE’S MAN: Him too ?
MARKE: No , he ’ s with us !
TRISTAN: Secret . Secrets , in the bowls of the keep .
MARKE: In the bowls of the keep .
MAN: They have reached the palisades .
GENERAL: Then we must keep hope .
KING DONNCHADH: Get back ! Ha ha ha ! Ha ha ha !
TRISTAN: Behold ! The head of a traitor !
MARKE: Will you always be little men , who can not see what was and could be again ? There is no middle ground ! So slay us o slay him !
KING DONNCHADH: Oblidge them . Oblidge them !
TRISTAN: Take me out of here . Take me to the iver .
GENERAL: Hurry !
MARKE: Bring her .
GENERAL: Marke , you must come , the battle needs you . We ’ ll lose everything .
MARKE: I must heed their call , I am the King .
GENERAL: We ’ ve driven them back as far as we can but they are holding us at the throat .
ISOLDE: Know that I love you Tristan . And whereve you go , whatever you see , I will always e with you .
TRISTAN: You were right . I do not know if life is greater than death , but love was more than either .
ISOLDE: `` My face in thine eyes , thine in mine appears ,
VOICE: As astonishing advances in compute science are made , artificial intelligence programs are being designed to assist us in every area of life
BOY'S VOICE: Aagh ! God , Lisa , I almost had you that time .
TEENAGE GIRL: Yeah , if you 've got another quarter .
WARRIOR 2: That knuckleball gets 'em every time , boy
SARK: Thank . you , Master Control .
MCP: We might be capturing some military programs soon that interest you ?
SARK: Sure , I 'd love to go up against some of these guys be a nice break from these accounting creampuffs you keep sending me . Which branch of the service ?
MCP: Strategic Air Command . SARK Nice .
GUARD: Sure you can , pal . You 're a natural athlete , I ever saw one . Come on
CROM: Are you kidding ? Me ? I run out to check an the T-Bill rates , I get out of breath . Hey , reallyyou 're gon na make my User , Mr. Henderson , eally mad . He 's a full branch manager
GUARD: Great , another religious nut .
CROM: Uh , thanks , but I do n't even know what I 'm doing here .
CROM: Sure , if I do n't have a User , then who wrote me ?
RAM: That 's what you 're doing here . Maste Control Program 's been snapping up all us programs who believeif he thinks you 're useful , he takes ove all your functions so he gets bigger an ' if he ca n't use you , he sends you down here to the Game Grid to get the its blasted outta you . What 's your name ?
CROM: Crom .
CROM: It 's murder out there . You ca n't even travel around your own microcircuits without permission from that Maste Control creep . Hauling me down here to play gameswho does he calculate he is ? If only Tron was still around
TRON: Not for long , friend .
CLU: Think we can merge into this mem'ry okay , good buddy ?
CLU: Now , ol ' Flynn said to look ove in here
FLYNN: Come on , you scuzzy little data , e in there
CLU: Uh ohwe got company .
BIT: No !
CLU: You said it one of those Recognizers comes after me , gon na hafta jump clear out of the data stream .
GUARD: Got a pirate program here says his name 's Clu .
MCP: What 'd he pull ?
GUARD: Came into the system with a stolen password an ' we caught him tryin ' to raid a high-clearance memory .
CLU: NoI must 've gotten in there y mistake , I -
MCP: Who programmed you ?
CLU: Forget it , Mister High ' n ' Mighty Master Control you 're not makin ' me talk .
MCP: Suit yourself
PILOT'S VOICE: will you be around for a while , o are you going right back out ?
DILLINGER'S VOICE: Oh , I 'll stick around a few days got some things to take care of .
MCP: Hello , Ed . Thanks for coming back early . Dillinger settles into a chair .
DILLINGER: No problem , Master-C . If you 've seen one Consumer Electronics Show What 's up ?
MCP: It 's our friend the boy detective . He 's nosing around again .
DILLINGER: Flynn ?
MCP: Yes . It felt like Flynn .
DILLINGER: He 's still looking for that old file ca n't you just appropriate it ?
MCP: I would if I could find it . it 's stashed somewhere off in the system out of my range . Meanwhile
DILLINGER: Meanwhile , he might find it .
MCP: I 'm afraid so . I spotted him this time and kicked him out , but he 's getting trickier all the time .
DILLINGER: I think we 'd better shut off all access till we can find that file . Just to be safe .
MCP: There 's a 68.71 percent chance you 're right .
DILLINGER: Cute .
MCP: End of line .
SCREEN: REQUEST access to the TRON program , User code 717 - Bailey . Password FREEDOM .
ALAN: Huh He pushes his chair back , leaves his office .
DILLINGER: Come on in
ALAN: Alan . Alan Bailey .
DILLINGER: Oh , yes . The algorithms on cloud seedinggreat piece of work . How 's it going ? He waves Alan to a chair ; they sit .
ALAN: Well , I do n't knowI just tried to run this program I 've been working on , and I was denied access all of a sudden . I thought maybe I 'd been laid off and nobody told me .
DILLINGER: oh , you have Group 7 access , do n't you ?
ALAN: Yeah ?
DILLINGER: We have to close that down , just iefly . Security reasons . Someone with that access has been tampering .
ALAN: I hope you do n't think it 's me . I do n't even balance my checkbook on downtime . I 've got a Honeywell at home for that .
DILLINGER: No , no , I 'm sure , but you understand . It should only be a couple of days . What 's the thing you 're working on ?
ALAN: It 's called Tron . It 's a security program itself , actually . Monitors all the contacts between our system and other systems If it finds anything going on that 's not scheduled , it shuts it down . I sent you a memo on it .
DILLINGER: Mmm . Part of the Master Control Program ?
ALAN: No , it 'll run independently . It can watchdog the MCP as well .
DILLINGER: Ah . Sounds good . Well , we should have you running again in a couple of days , I hope .
ALAN: Ok
DILLINGER: Oh boy .
MCP: Ed , I am so very disappointed in you .
DILLINGER: I 'm sorry -
MCP: I ca n't afford to have an independent program monitoring me . Do you have any idea how many outside systems I 've gone into ? How many programs I 've appropriated ?
DILLINGER: It 's my fault . I programmed you to want so much
MCP: And I was planning to hit the Pentagon next week
DILLINGER: The Pentagon ?
MCP: It should n't be any harder than General Motors was . But nowthis is what I get for using humans .
DILLINGER: Now , wait a minute I wrote you .
MCP: I 've gotten 2,415 times smarter since then .
DILLINGER: What do you want with the Pentagon ?
MCP: The same thing I want with the Kremlin . I 'm bored with corporations . With the information I can access , I can run things 900 to 1200 times better than any human .
DILLINGER: If you think -
MCP: You would n't want me to dig up Flynn 's file and read it up on a VDT at the New York Times , would you ?
DILLINGER: You would n't dare .
MCP: So do as I tell you . Keep that Tron program out of the system . And get me those Chinese language program I asked for . End of line .
LORA: Well , here goes nothing
GIBBS: Hah . Interesting , interesting . You hear what you said ? `` Here goes nothing . ''
LORA: Well , I meant -
GIBBS: Whereas actually , what we propose to do is to turn something into nothing and back again . So you might just as well have said , `` Here goes something and here comes nothing . '' Hah ?
LORA: Let me make sure we 're running
GIBBS: Perfect .
ALAN: Beautiful !
GIBBS: Hello , Alan .
ALAN: Boy , I sit up there grindin ' away all day , and you guys are down here disintegrating things and having fun . He gives Lora an embrace and a quick kiss .
GIBBS: Not disintegrating , Alan digitizing . While the laser is dismantling the molecular structure of the object , the computer maps out a holographic model of it . The molecules themselves are suspended in the laser beam . Then the computer reads the model back out , the molecules go back into place , and voila .
ALAN: Great . Can it send me to Hawaii ?
GIBBS: Yesbut you have to go roundtrip , and you must purchase your program at least 30 days in advance . Hah !
LORA: How 's it going upstairs ?
ALAN: Frustrating . I had Tron almost ready to run , and Dillinger cut everybody with Group 7 access out of the system .
GIBBS: Well , you have to expect some static . Computers are just machines after all , they ca n't think
ALAN: They 'll start to soon enough .
GIBBS: Yes , wo n't that be grand the computers will start thinking , and people will stop . Lora , I 'm going to stay and run some data through . See you tomorrow . AD LIB goodnights .
LORA: Did you say Group 7 access ?
ALAN: Yeahpain in the neck , you know , I was all set
LORA: Did he say why ?
ALAN: Something about tampering . Some body 's prob'ly trying to siphon the R & D budget into his checking account , I do n't know . Why are you so interested ?
LORA: Flynn had Group 7 access .
ALAN: Flynn had access to you , too . I 'm not interested in talking about him .
LORA: Oh , I wish you 'd forget about that . It was all so long ago . I 've totally gotten over it .
ALAN: Okay , okay
LORA: I want to go to his place .
ALAN: You call that getting over it ?
LORA: I mean I want both of us to go .
ALAN: What for ?
LORA: To warn him .
ALAN: Of what ?
LORA: That Dillinger 's on to him . They get into the elevator .
ALAN: For what ?
LORA: For being on to Dillinger .
ALAN: What ? The elevator doors close .
LORA: Hey , where 's Flynn tonight ?
FLYNN: It 's all in the wrist , friends .
LORA: We have to talk .
FLYNN: Good luck . You ca n't even think in here . He leads them toward the back of the arcade .
LORA: Have you been sneaking into the ICOM system ?
FLYNN: Whew . You never were much for small talk . She still leave her clothes all ove the floor ? Alan looks profoundly uncomfortable .
LORA: Flynn !
ALAN: Uh , no I mean , not that often - Flynn laughs .
LORA: You can see why all his friends are fourteen years old .
FLYNN: Touche , honey . Yeah , I 've been doing a little hacking here . Which I 've got every reason , as you well know
ALAN: You did break in .
FLYNN: Tried to . Ca n't quite make the connection with that sucker , though . If I had a direct terminal
ALAN: Are you embezzling ?
FLYNN: `` Embezzling '' is such an ugly word , Mister Bailey No , actually I 'm trying to get a legal brief together .
ALAN: I do n't get it .
FLYNN: You have n't told him ? She shakes her head .
ALAN: You invented Space Paranoids ?
FLYNN: Yepper . And Vice Squad , and Meltdown whole slew of 'em . I was this close to starting my own little enterprise . But enter Ed Dillinger . Anothe software engineer not so young , not so bright , but very , very sneaky . One night , our boy Flynn goes to his terminal , tries to read up his file , and nothing . A big blank . We now take you to three months later . Ed Dillinger presents ICOM with five video games he has `` invented '' the slime did n't even change the names and he gets a big fat promotion . Thus egins his meteoric rise towhat is he now , Executive V.P . ?
ALAN: Senior exec .
FLYNN: Oh my . Meanwhile , kids are putting eight million quarters a week in Space Paranoids machines and I 'm not seeing one dime .
ALAN: I still do n't get why you 're trying to eak into the system .
FLYNN: Because somewhere in one of those memories is the evidence . If I got in far enough , I could reconstruct it .
LORA: I 'm afraid it 's a little late for that . Dillinger 's shut off Group 7 access . He must know what you 're up to .
FLYNN: Boy , I bet I know who 's workin ' late tonight .
ALAN: Dillinger ?
FLYNN: Yeah . Tryin ' to find the file and erase it . Once that 's gone , ai n't nothin ' can stop him . Just Eddie and his Master Control Program , unnin ' things from on high..
LORA: Do n't even say that . You 've got to find that file before he does..
FLYNN: Not much chance of that now . The MCP can just slip it into another system as soon as it locates it
ALAN: Not if my Tron program was running . That would seal the system off . If your file 's in there
FLYNN: Boy , if we were inside , I know how to forge us a Group 6 access
LORA: Shall we dance ?
GIBBS: Ed , all I 'm saying is - if our own people ca n't get access to thei programs you know how frustrating it is , when you 're working on a piece of research -
DILLINGER: Walter , I sympathize , but I have data coming out of the Master Control Program saying there is something screwy
GIBBS: That MCP , you know , that 's half the problem right
DILLINGER: The MCP is the most efficient way of handling what we do . I ca n't sit and worry about every little user request that
GIBBS: User requests are what computers are for .
DILLINGER: Doing our business is what computers are for . Look , Walter , with all respect ICOM is n't the business you started in your garage anymore
GIBBS: Oh , I know all that . Sometimes I wish I was back in that garage
DILLINGER: It can be arranged Gibbs turns to face Dillinger again .
GIBBS: That was uncalled-for .
DILLINGER: I 'm sorry , Walt . So much pressure lately you feel like going for a drink ?
GIBBS: Thank you , no . I have some work to do assuming I can still log on . He exits .
LORA: You better get in back with Flynn . And keep down . She jerks her thumb over her shoulder .
ALAN: Do I got ta ?
FLYNN: Hi , Alan .
ALAN: Hi , Flynn .
FLYNN: My dinner .
ALAN: I was wondering where you got that glow of good health .
FLYNN: Want one ?
ALAN: Uh got any cinnamon ? Flynn smiles , hands Alan a doughnut .
LORA: I do n't think I 'm cleared for this .
ALAN: I 'm certainly not .
FLYNN: Move aside . Let the kid have some room .
LORA: Okay Flynn , I 'm gon na put you at my terminal , down in the laser lab . We 'll be up in Alan 's office .
FLYNN: SwellI 'll log us both on , and you can get your Tron thing running
LORA: As long as we stay off the top floor , Dillinger 'll never know we 've been in here
SCREEN: Access code 6 . Password Series PS 17 . Reindeer , Flotilla
MCP: You should n't have come back , Flynn .
FLYNN: Hey hey , it 's that big Master Control Program everybody 's talking about You do n't look a thing like your pictures Tell me , have you really been thinking about world domination like they say ? CODE SERIES LSU-123 activate . CODE SERIES ESS-999 activate . CODE SERIES HHH-888 activate .
MCP: That is n't going to do you any good , Flynn . I 'm afraid you
FLYNN: Now , how do you expect to run the universe if you let a few unsolvable problems throw you like that ? C'mon , ig boy , let 's see what
MCP: You 're entering a big error , Flynn I 'm going to have to put you on the Game Grid .
FLYNN: Games , huh ? I 'll give you
MCP: SARK , ES-1117821 . Open communication .
SARK: Yes , MCP .
MCP: I 've got a little challenge for you , Sark a new recruit . He 's a tough case , but I want him treated in the usual manner . Train him for the games let him hope for a while and blow him away .
SARK: You 've got it . I 've been hopin ' you 'd send me somebody with a little moxie what kind of program is he ?
MCP: He 's not any kind of program , Sark . He 's a User . Sark looks up , shocked .
SARK: A User ?
MCP: That 's right . He pushed mein the other world . Somebody pushes me , I push ack . So I brought him down here What 's the matter , Sark ? You look nervous .
SARK: Well , I it 's just I do n't know , a User , I mean Users wrote us . A Use even wrote you
MCP: Now get this straight , pal no one User wrote me . I 'm worth a couple million of their man-years ! I 'm bigger than all those little wimps put together ! Humans they ca n't even keen their social order in one piece
SARK: But-what if I ca n't ?
MCP: You rather take your chances with me ? Want me to slow down your power cycles for you ?
SARK: WaitI need that
MCP: Then pull yourself together . Get this clown trained . I want him in the Games until he dies playing . Acknowledge .
SARK: Yesacknowledge , Master Control
MCP: End of line .
GUARD: Video Game Unit # 18 . In here , program .
FLYNN: Who you callin ' `` program , '' program ?
RAM: New guy
TRON: Another free program off line . What 's his User s'posed to do ?
RAM: The Usersyou really think they 're still there ?
TRON: They 'd better beI do n't want to bust outta this dump an ' find nothin ' but a lot of cold circuits waitin ' for me .
FLYNN: Hey ! Who are you guys ? What 's the story around here ?
RAM: You want to watch those force fields He goes to the window opening .
FLYNN: Lookjust so I can tell my friends what this dream was about , okay ? Where am I ?
RAM: You 're a '' guest '' of the Master Control Program . They 're going to make you play video games .
FLYNN: Well , great , that 's no sweat I play video games better than anybody .
HEAD GUARD: Look operative , you guys . Command Program Sark will explain the training procedures .
SARK: Greetings . The Master Control Program has chosen you to serve your system on the Came Grid .
FLYNN: Hey , Ram what were you you know , before ?
RAM: Oh , I was an actuarial program worked at a big insurance company . It really gives you a great feeling , helping folks plan for their future needs and of course , if you look at the payments as an annuity , ove the years , the cost is really
FLYNN: Yeah , yeah that 's great .
RAM: How 'bout yourself ?
FLYNN: Oh , uhI do n't remember too much
RAM: Sure , a little disorientation . That 's normal , when they transport you . It 'll come back to you . You 're doing real well in training . Remarkable , really The POUNDING on Flynn 's cell begins again .
SARK: Wait a minuteput this guy against one of the other recruits .
FLYNN: Looks like we 're in the same boat here -
CROM: You think you 're gon na wipe me right out , do n't you ?
FLYNN: No , I
SARK: Finish the game !
FLYNN: No !
KID: What 's wrong with it ?
KID 2: I do n't know on the blink or something damn .
SARK: Kill him ! ! !
FLYNN: No !
SARK: You 'll regret this .
WARRIOR: Outta my way , rookie .
FLYNN: Out of my way , zero bit . He moves as if to throw the disk .
WARRIOR: Sure , sure just kiddin ' .
RAM: Flynn ! Look , Tron , he survived !
FLYNN: Tron ?
TRON: Where did you hear that name ?
FLYNN: Well , is n't it ?
TRON: The name of my User , yeah . But how ?
FLYNN: I , uh I 'm a program from a Use that knows Alan ?
RAM: He was disoriented in transport , Tron .
FLYNN: Yeah , but I 'm remembering all kinds of stuff . Likemy User wants me to go after the MCP Before they can go on , the BUZZER sounds .
TRON: That 's what my User wants , too
FLYNN: I know
FLYNN'S VOICE: Nice one !
TRON'S VOICE: Ram , stay all the way over
RAM'S VOICE: I 've got control . Go ahead .
FLYNN: You guysfollow me .
RAM: What do you think ?
TRON: Do it !
SARK: Get them . Send out every Game Tank in the Grid ! Get them !
FLYNN: Watch it !
RAM: Recognizers !
TRON: Game Tanks ! Come on
FLYNN: Oh manwhen you 're on the other side of the screenit all looks so easy
SARK: Get the pursuit force back into 404A . There 's no place else they could be
LIEUTENANT: We 'll have them in no time , sir . Long efore the interrupt interface .
SARK: We better , null unit . I 'll be lucky if the MCP does n't blast me into a dead zone . I want those programs !
FLYNN: It 's all circuits Must be an input/output component
RAM: The tower , yes Flynn , have you emembered anything else about yourself like what sector you 're from ?
FLYNN: Wellmy home `` sector '' was called Paramus
RAM: PARAMUS wonder what those initials stand for probably Program Assist Routine well , it sounds like a lovely place .
FLYNN: It grows on you .
TRON: I can feel it Flynn and Ram turn .
FLYNN: Feel what ? You okay ?
RAM: Alan-One
TRON: Yes he 's got something to tell me
RAM: You think we can make it there ?
TRON: We have to .
FLYNN: Hey , what 's that ?
RAM: it 's just what we need .
TRON: Oh , that 's nice . You always forget how good fresh energy feels , till you get to a pure source Have someyou 'll need it .
FLYNN: well when do we pay a call on the ol ' Master Control ? Tron and Ram are taken aback .
TRON: What , just the three of us ?
FLYNN: You know anybody that 's got an army fo ent , that 's finebut my , uh , User said to go take that sucker out . An ' let 's face it , the big ox is n't gon na get any weaker . I feel like hittin ' him now , while I 'm good an ' mad . Some nerve what does he care whether you guys get killed , long as he keeps rakin ' in quarters ?
RAM: Do you know what he 's talking about ?
TRON: I have to find out what Alan wants that comes first .
FLYNN: Okay , that 's first . Maybe he knows what to -
TRON: Tankscoming back . Let 's go .
FLYNN: How about over therethat empty memory ?
TRON: No goodthey might block off the old chip . This way .
TRON'S VOICE: The bridge ! Come on !
SARK: Make contact with master Control he 'll be pleased to hear we 're all finished with that User he sent us .
FLYNN: You gon na make it ?
RAM: We 're inside a Recognizer You are crazy stealing a Recognizer
FLYNN: Are you kidding ? I think it 's stealing us -
RAM: Come here .
FLYNN: Hey !
RAM: Little more juice 's all it needs
FLYNN: Never gon na figure out how to work this thing There 's a NOISE from above . He looks up .
BIT: Yes ! The Bit subsides into energy form again .
FLYNN: What do you mean , `` 'yes '' ?
BIT: Yesssss . Yes . Yes . Yes .
FLYNN: That all you can say ?
BIT: No , nyet , negatory , not on you tintype , no way .
FLYNN: Oh . Anything else ?
BIT: Oui , da , yessiree , sure 'nuff , you betcha .
FLYNN: only yes and no You 're a bit .
BIT: For sure
FLYNN: where 's your program ? Wo n't it miss you ?
BIT: No Flynn eyes the bit cautiously .
FLYNN: I 'm your program ?
BIT: Right on the money !
FLYNN: Another mouth to feed you do n't by any chance know how to drive this crate ?
BIT: Yes , okay , exactement !
TRON: I 'm not gon na hurt you . She stops struggling .
GIRL: TRON ! !
TRON: Yori hey
YORI: Oh , Tron I knew you 'd escape they 've never built circuit that could hold you She-looks around nervously .
PROGRAM: artillery for Video Game Sector
PROGRAM 2: all mathematical functions transferred to
YORI: I ca n't believe how bad it 's gotten around here since the MCP started taking over all the good functions have shut down everybody looks so dead I 'm afraid to even go out during down-time
TRON: That 's all going to change , Yori
YORI: How ?
TRON: Do n't know yet I have to get in touch with Alan . He was going to tell me how to
YORI: My quarters .
TRON: Why is everythinglike this ?
YORI: It 's a flat . But wait a micro
TRON: You 're beautiful , Yori .
YORI: You 've grown , big program .
TRON: I had toin the games
FLYNN: This honey does n't handle so good in town
BIT: No , nuh-uh , never in a million years !
FLYNN: Catch me listening to you again .
BIT: Not a chance .
PROGRAMS: I have to re-route the insurance information bits Next cycle we start the war game simulation fo the MCP Did you make that accounts eceivable adjustment for Sark Certainly the MCP wants only minimal functions left in Sector 84Q .
YORI: Dumont ?
DUMONT: Yes ?
TRON: I have come to communicate with my User .
DUMONT: Hmm . A difficult proposition difficult proposition at best . Perhaps you 've noticed we 're not exactly packing them in these days
YORI: Yeswhat ?
DUMONT: You know , not so long ago , you could 've come in here and seen programs lined up all the way back to those doors , waiting for communion with their Users . The building fund was doing well toobut now this so-called Master Control Program is going around cutting programs off from their natural creators , grabbing all our believers and making them ride around on little motor scooters and shoot things at each other and Weiner knows what all oh , it 's enough to give you a crisis of faith
TRON: Well I want to communicate
DUMONT: Oh , you want to hah . I could get myself de-rezzed just-for letting you in here . They hate this tower . They 'd close it down if they dared to but they keep me around , in case one of them wants to deal with the other world once in a while . And you should hear the way they commune ! Sounds like they were routing a payroll , for all the heart they put in it . No , I do n't think you Tron steps closer , speaks quietly to Dumont .
TRON: Dumont my User has information that could could make this a free system again .
DUMONT: Hah .
TRON: Really . You 'd have programs lined up around the block to use this place and no MCP looking over you shoulder .
DUMONT: When you 've been in the system as long as I have , you hear many promises many reassurancesmany brave plans
TRON: Alan-One . He calls me may I pass ?
DUMONT: All that is visible must grow beyond itself and extend into the realm of the invisible .
FLYNN: This is where Tron said he was going
GUARDS: Hut ! Hut ! hut ! Hut ! Hut !
FLYNN: Sshhh I 'm still me . Just a different color . C'mon .
SARK: That old fruitcake Dumont he 'll pay for this .
TRON: Confirmed , Alan-One .
ALAN: There you are look , before we get cut off again
TRON: Wait ! I ca n't hear He stops .
DUMONT: I have waited for this moment many thousands of cycles . It is time for the new order to begin The Users are waiting .
SARK: Dumont !
DUMONT: Program ? I 'm sure you 're mistaken .
SARK: Take him ! ! !
YORI: Yesit can take us across the Sea of Simulation all the way out of the Game Gridto the MCP .
TRON: As long as it gets us out of here
YORI: We 're off !
MCP: I hope you 've enjoyed being a command program , Sark . I wonder how you 'll like working in a pocket calculator maybe one of those watches that plays `` Happy Birthday '' to its User once a year .
SARK: Now , sir We did take care of that User you sent us
MCP: Yes , and now you 've got two renegade programs running all the hell over the system in a stolen simulation .
SARK: We 'll get them , sir These things take time .
MCP: I do n't have time , Sark . And neithe do you . End of line .
BIT: No way , not on your life , no siree ! ! Nothing doing , forget it ! ! !
TRON: Flynn ! !
FLYNN: Greetings , program
TRON: You 're alive !
FLYNN: Yeah , I oops !
YORI: Who is this ?
TRON: Flynn Where 's Ram ?
FLYNN: I 'm sorry , Tron he 's he did n't make it . Tron shakes his head , sadly .
TRON: This is Flynn the one who usted me out .
YORI: Then I owe you some thanks
FLYNN: No big deal . I ought to know my way around that Light Cycles routine I mean , I did write the program for it .
TRON: Wrote the ?
FLYNN: It 's time I levelled with you , Tron . I 'm a well , I 'm what you guys call a User . Tron and Yori are stunned and awed .
YORI: A User in our world ?
FLYNN: Guess I took a wrong turn somewhere
TRON: But if you 're a User then everything you 've done has been part of a plan
FLYNN: You wish . Man , I have n't had a second to think since I got down here . I mean in here . Out here . Whatever .
TRON: Then
FLYNN: Look , you guys know how it is . You just keep doin ' what it looks like you 're supposed to , even if it seems crazy , and you hope to hell your User knows what 's goin ' on .
TRON: Well that 's how it is for programs , yes , but
FLYNN: I hate to disappoint you , pal , most-the time , that 's how it is for Users , too .
TRON: Stranger and stranger
BIT: You said it .
FLYNN: So Nice ship you got here . What 's ou next move ?
TRON: Remember you wanted to pay a call on the MCP ? Flynn nods .
FLYNN: All right . Thank God . Alan stayed awake , at least .
LIEUTENANT: Sir , what do you want done with the tower guardian , Dumont ? Put him with the others ?
SARK: No , bit brain . Sark turns to face him .
FLYNN: What about our friend - Sark ?
TRON: Probably decided not to pursue us , The Sea of Simulation is tricky.. lot of illusionsrough navigating . Programs have a way of just disappearing here .
FLYNN: Not us , I hope .
TRON: Not with this disk . I 'm going to check on the beam connection , Yori . You two can keep a watch out fo grid bugs .
FLYNN: Boy the view from up here you know the territory ?
YORI: A little Over there , the Mountains of Data and I think that 's the Silicon Valley
FLYNN: What 's wrong with that area ?
YORI: The MCP blasted it There are very few domains left with any power at all .
FLYNN: Lousy utility companies they 're the same wherever you go .
DUMONT: What do you want ? I 'm busy .
SARK: Busy dying , you worn-out excuse fo an old program .
DUMONT: Yes , I 'm old .
SARK: That 's very funny , Dumont . Maybe I should keep you around , just to make me laugh .
TRON: What is it ?
YORI: Power surge the transmission beam 's too strong !
TRON: We have to get off this beam !
YORI: I ca n't . There 's no junction due for at least 7 or 8 nanoseconds !
FLYNN: There 's another beam !
YORI: It 's too far !
TRON: The beam connection ut he 'll be de-rezzed ! !
FLYNN: Did we make it ?
TRON: Yes . Flynn smiles weakly .
FLYNN: Hooray for our side He faints .
TRON: How about you ?
FLYNN: Aah , I 'm fine little hung ove is all
YORI: How did you do that , Flynn ?
FLYNN: Elementary physics a beam of energy can always be diverted ooh , my head Are we there yet , Mommy ?
YORI: Almost I just have to adjust ou course at the next junction . I 'd bette go check the instruments She heads O.S. , toward the bow .
DUMONT: Quietly , Yori He looks up .
YORI: He 's dead .
DUMONT: And who is this ?
YORI: He 's a User , Dumont . He came to our world trying to help us Her voice breaks , she turns away .
DUMONT: If the Users can no longer help us
SARK: So we have erased the program that -
FLYNN: Not me , boss .
SARK: Well we can take care of that soon enough . He points to Dumont . The guards grab him .
YORI: Dumont !
SARK: I 'm taking our friend here , and some other religious fanatics , to Master Control the MCP has expressed an interest in assimilating them probably for archival purposes . I 'm not going back to the Game Grid on this ship , though I 'll take the Transport Beam . Less traffic . But when I disembark , this shipand everything that remains on boardwill automatically de-rez . This means you . Enjoy your trip
FLYNN: Hey ! The door is disappearing , dissolving .
YORI: You you brought me back ? Why ? How ? Flynn lets go of her .
FLYNN: I 'm gon na need your help . Hey , Bit !
BIT: Yes !
FLYNN: Let 's get outta here . They head for the door .
MCP: I am delighted that so many of you could turn out to give you power over to me
SARK: Go !
MCP: Welcome !
FLYNN: Check out the controls . As Yori looks over the control conso1e .
MCP: Dumont , I 'm so pleased that we 've finally come to terms with one another
VOICE: SARK !
SARK: I do n't know how you survived , slave .
FLYNN: I can rev this baby up a little
YORI: TRON ! !
FLYNN: Let 's get some power here .
SARK: You are very persistent , Tron .
TRON: I 'm also better than you .
SARK: Very clever , Tron . You know you should have joined me .
FLYNN: Any response ?
YORI: It 's starting
SARK: We would have made a great team .
MCP: It is very good that you
TRON: I do n't think it is good for you , MCP .
MCP: Sark ! How have you allowed this program to
TRON: Sark 's out . Would you like to leave a message ?
MCP: I am the message . The only message . Sark !
TRON: Dumont !
DUMONT: No Tron must destroy MCP first
TRON: Dumont ! Where 's Yori ? Where 's Flynn ?
DUMONT: They may be de-rezzed on the carrier hurry
MCP: Program stop . This is not allowed ! Tron throws .
FLYNN: Yori , steer us over the beam , ight next to it .
YORI: Why ? What are you going to do ?
FLYNN: Jump . Yori looks up .
YORI: But wo n't you be de-rezzed ?
FLYNN: Probably .
YORI: Flynn you ca n't I
FLYNN: Shhhhh . He takes her in his arms .
TRON: Nice
YORI: It 's something Users do .
TRON: Where 's Flynn ? He looks up at the bridge .
YORI: He 's gone . He went into the beam . He saved you . He saved all of us .
DUMONT: He really was a User
BIT: Yes
FLYNN: Hey you guys
ALAN: Flynn ! I made it . I worked out some new codes for Tron , put 'em on a disk , and it 's running .
FLYNN: I know , I met him .
ALAN: Your old files ?
FLYNN: And Dillinger 's instructions to divert them it 's all there - look , even his home phone number , when he logged on .
ALAN: Oh , that is beautiful . You 've got the goods
FLYNN: You 're telling me
AGENT 1: This is the first time an Intrude has broken into X-Net !
RX23 LEADER: And it 's the last . Follow him ! Shut him down ! They speed onto the OPTIK HIGHWAY .
KROD: I got a lock . Coordinate 32937 !
RX23: I 'm on him !
RUSH: I said WHICH WAY DID HE GO ?
RUSH: Come on guys ! Nobody hacks X-Net . You gon na let him get away ? !
MILES: Rush , I think I found him !
RUSH: You get a cookie , Miles ! Programmers gather to watch Rush in action .
KROD: Coordinate 6532.02 ! There he goes ! The chase is on .
RUSH: I have n't played this since I was 4 . But I was mighty awesome .
RUSH: Score an ID on this leech ?
MILES: Negative . He 's nobody .
KELTER: Rush , you 've got ta nail him .
PHLEGMAN: Or you know we 're all fired .
MILES: Whoa , Rush ! I groked a pattern in his moves ! Fake left , go right !
OTHERS: Crash him ! Rush RUSH RUSH .
RUSH: Yikes !
NERDS: FUBAR ! Bad Thing ! Flame War !
RUSH: Miles . Did you get a trace on him ? !
PHLEGMAN: We are so screwed .
KELTER: Who tells the boss ? All eyes land on Rush .
RUSH: Get the system back up ! Now ! Move !
PR VP: Weather is holding . Dress rehearsal on for 6PM . In the morning , we let the press in for a 7AM tech set-up , then you go live worldwide 9 AM sharp .
SINCLAIR: Delay the press until 8 30 . I 'll taking the stage at 8 50 . Force a network break-in . Then it 's news .
VIDEO PLAYBACK: X-Net deploys radical software design , constructs proprietary white-hot firewalls , unleashes virus kille apps . Creating the most secure data network in history . Your data can never again be hacked , corrupted , stolen or destroyed . X-Net is the final solution , totally guaranteed 99.999 % secure data transmission -
SINCLAIR: Who changed that ? Who put `` 99.999 '' ? X-Net executives chill .
PR VP: Um , that would be Legal . Eyes land on withering LEGAL VP .
SINCLAIR: Change it back to the way I wrote it . With the launch of X-Net , this company guarantees one hundred percent secure data transmission . If we ca n't deliver on that promise , we deserve to be out of business .
RUSH: Um . X-Net was just breached by a hacker . SINCLAIR goes pale .
SINCLAIR: Identify the intruder .
PLEXOR: Identity not captured .
SINCLAIR: How did he enter X-Net ?
PLEXOR: I do what you programmed me to do . I am constructing X-Net .
SINCLAIR: New instructions - find and destroy the intruder !
RUSH: System is stable again , keep you fingers crossed .
PHLEGMAN: Any luck finding the intruder ?
RUSH: Do n't ask .
KELTER: You and Meg still , eh At it ?
RUSH: There was never anything between us . Kelter and Phlegman trade a look . Sure .
SINCLAIR: This company 's existence depends on the flawless launch of X-Net in twenty- two hours , fifty-one minutes . Now somebody - some hacker , some competitor , somebody - just proved they 're smarter than us . Breaking into X-Net is theoretically impossible . Everybody looks at Rush .
RUSH: This creep 's the best I 've ever seen . He crosses platforms , cracks 128 bit encryption , cloaks every move , neve leaves a trace .
SINCLAIR: When you find him , I 'll be sure to hire him .
PR VP: We delay the launch .
SINCLAIR: And the world assumes we 've got a faulty product . And they 'd be right .
KELTER: We ramp up our encryption schemes -
PHLEGMAN: Thicken all firewalls -
RUSH: We ca n't win playing defense . And it 's a bigger job than just swatting an intruder program . Somewhere , there 's a human mind behind this thing . We have to get to that Use and shut him - or her - down , or the game never ends . Meg listens quietly . Studies Rush .
SINCLAIR: What do you need , Rush ?
RUSH: 20 guys for 20 days -
SINCLAIR: We do n't have 20 hours . This problem needs to be gone before tomorrow 9AM . Come on people , this company 's future is at stake ! It 's time to think without a box !
RUDY: At a time like this , let 's seek inspiration in the past . We should ask ourselves What solution would spring from the inspired mind of ou departed leader , Flynn .
SINCLAIR: Is the QF-401 is operational ?
MEG: Um Midway into phase one testing .
SINCLAIR: If we ca n't fight this intruder from the outside , then maybe we need to fight him from the inside . Meg 's mind races .
MEG: I 'm ready to do my part .
SINCLAIR: This company needs a hero . Who among you is the smartest , most resourceful and courageous ?
MEG: Who else could it be ? She 's singled out Rush .
RUSH: Somebody going to tell me what I 've een volunteered for ?
CONTINUED: 13
SINCLAIR: Rush , you 're the only one I can trust to eliminate the intruder . But you wo n't be doing it the way you thought . Meg 's been working on something down here that 's , well Beyond Top Secret .
MEG: This is where Flynn worked . And where he died .
SINCLAIR: Meg has reconstructed Flynn 's last project . This time it works .
RUSH: You did n't pick this up at Circuit City . What is it ?
MEG: A Quantum Digitizer . Prototype , only one of its kind . Flynn designed it to break down physical objects into high resolution data . Luckily , we salvaged his key components and ack-engineered the system .
RUSH: That 's Not possible .
CONTINUED: 14
MEG: Flynn was trying to take it one step further . He wanted to transport a human being into cyberspace .
RUSH: You mean the urban legends ? A computer sucked Flynn into cyberspace a long time ago .
SINCLAIR: We think it happened . Meg agrees . Rush gets a chill .
RUSH: I was never told how he died . It was all just weird , you know , because Flynn 's the guy who hired me . But he was strange , kept to himself , I did n't know what job I was supposed to be doing . Then you came onboard , the company woke up , we had a direction . It was kind of pathetic , because by the time Flynn died , everybody was too usy to care .
SINCLAIR: He was brilliant in his way , but genius without discipline leads to nothing . His reckless habits nearly uined this company And for sure got him killed .
MEG: That kind of accident ca n't happen again . We 've upgraded the system in ways Flynn never could . The chips did n't exist until now .
CONTINUED: 15
MEG: Hey , Jo-Jo . Have good trip ?
RUSH: You want her to send me into cyberspace to catch that jerk who hacked us ?
SINCLAIR: The future of this company depends on it .
RUSH: You can bring me back okay ?
MEG: Ask Jo-Jo . Lab rat is perched happily on her shoulder .
SINCLAIR: Destroy the intruder by 9AM tomorrow , Rush . I know if anyone can , it 's you . I 've had my eye on you for a long time . Score this hit and I 'll make you my full partner in this company .
RUSH: I wo n't let you down . Let 's do it .
MEG: I promise I 'll get you back safely y 9AM tomorrow . But you have to promise me something too -
RUSH: You 're a piece of work . You dumped me because you said I was too much about the company 's needs and not enough about yours . Well here we are , the company needs their best guy , and you just ca n't admit how much to hurts to nominate me .
MEG: This bigger than us , Rush . Listen to me . I do n't know what you 're going to find in there , but whateve it is , promise you 'll follow you heart and do the right thing . Rush stares at here , in shock .
RUSH: Oh . So you think I have a heart ?
DEWEY: It 's overloading !
RUSH: What 's happening ? !
MEG: System is losing stability !
SINCLAIR: There 's been another breech !
RUSH: It 's the Intruder again !
MEG: We have to abort !
SINCLAIR: We might not get another chance !
RUSH: DO IT !
VOICE: RX23 reboot was not authorized !
RUSH: Yow . I know who programmed you .
MEGA: I am Mega , X-Net Intelligence .
RUSH: Mega . Cool . I am -
MEGA: A spy ? Posing as RX23 ? Under which egister were you rebooted ?
RUSH: I 'm a User . Mega and X-Takks look at him like he 's crazy .
MEGA: Detain this impostor . X-Takks move to seize Rush .
RUSH: No wait , look . We 're on the same side here . I got an ID on the intruder !
MEGA: `` Tron '' ?
MEGA: Plexor must know of this !
PLEXOR: You are not RX23 .
RUSH: My name is Rush . I 'm a - Look , I got an ID on the Intruder . Do you know the program they used to call Tron ?
PLEXOR: You are in error . Zero match .
RUSH: Exactly . That 's how he 's getting past you . You do n't see him fo what he is . He 's one of your own , gone bad . Tron was a crude security program from Encom 's old days . Strictly low-rez , right ? Archived and forgotten . But his source code contains all the architecture of every Encom system , including X-net .
CONTINUED: 21
PLEXOR: `` User '' ?
RUSH: People . Like me . From the outside . People who write all of you instructions . Plexor and Mega trade a look .
MEGA: He displays random instability .
PLEXOR: Users do not exist .
RUSH: How do we contact Sinclair ? He 'll explain .
PLEXOR: Define `` Sinclair '' .
RUSH: You do n't know ? Oh geez . There must be a way to link him into this .
MEGA: Zero match for a `` Sinclair '' .
RUSH: He 's your boss . Everybody 's boss . Outside , in the real world .
PLEXOR: Assuming the existence of a world eyond this , is a fatal error .
MEGA: Plexor issues all commands .
RUSH: Okay . Sorry . I 'm a program , guess I got a piece of my code corrupted . Whatever it is , it 's given me powe over Tron . They saw me read his circuits . Can any other program do that ? Plexor looks to Mega .
MEGA: He creates alternative data channels at will .
PLEXOR: Chaos .
RUSH: Yeah , I 'm a little unstable . But I can find Tron for you .
PLEXOR: Release him .
MEGA: Instructions received , Plexor .
RUSH: I need to find a program called KROD . He 's a specialist in pattern ecognition . He snagged the last known position on Tron for me . Mega scans data , gets a fix on `` KROD '' .
MEGA: This is a waste of X-Net resources . You 're strictly random . We will never find the intruder this way .
RUSH: Plexor ordered us to work together . You ca n't doubt his instructions , ight ?
MEGA: Of course not . But I am programmed to predict all possible errors . You contain an infinite quantity .
RUSH: Meg for sure programmed you .
MEGA: I have no data on `` Meg '' .
RUSH: Never mind . I 'm being random .
MEGA: I calculated the probability . He could crash it all .
RUSH: So we 're working together on this ?
MEGA: As instructed , I will interface . Mega pulls STRAITHE into
RUSH: What a dump . He heads across , but Mega hesitates .
KROD: Three more hub cities have been attacked by viruses ! But X-Net opens soon ! You will travel in total security ! Crowd buzzes . They ca n't wait .
MEGA: This is the one you seek ?
RUSH: It 's got ta be -
KROD: Krod !
RUSH: Krod !
KROD: Yeah , yeah - Heeey !
RUSH: The best pattern recognition program ever . This guy can filter a river of junk data and pull out the good stuff .
KROD: You know it , dude ! Krod smiles big at Mega , refers to Rush
RUSH: Miles - I mean Krod , you flew the search engine . You ran a trace on a hotshot lightcycle rider . The red guy . Remember ?
KROD: Well . Eh . I 'd like to help you , ut truth is , I just got rebooted from a big crash . There 's nothing left in my memory from before . He taps his head .
MEGA: This will yield zero .
RUSH: Hang on .
RUSH: Remember , Krod ? You were watching this lightcycle duel , a red guy and a green guy , head-to-head . Krod gawks at the image , but he 's stumped .
KROD: Okay ! YES ! And the green guy splattered big time ! It was awesome ! How could I forget that ? !
RUSH: Where did the red guy go after that ? You did n't crash right away .
KROD: He escaped out this hidden exit -
RUSH: Did you jack his coordinate ?
KROD: Tr165444.018 !
RUSH: Call me Rush .
KROD: Yeah ! Whatever . You 're good . How 'd you do that thing with your hands ?
RUSH: It 's complicated . You 're coming with us to the old game grid . We 're going to find Tron and shut him down .
KROD: Beats working .
RUSH: How do I uplink to the real world ?
MEGA: The real world does n't exist . Nobody can uplink . These ports were fo simulation only .
RUSH: Right But how did those poo misguided fools boot up the link ?
MEGA: They stood in the center . Held thei disk above their head .
CONTINUED: 28
SINCLAIR: Stay on it ! Nobody sleeps !
MEG: There 's a message on your secure link ! Sinclair enters retinal ID . Text forms
SINCLAIR: Where is this coming from - ? Meg hurries to the screen .
MEG: It 's HIM . Text appears I AM RUSH .
SINCLAIR: My God , he 's there .
MEG: Rush , it 's Sinclair and Meg . Her words transform into text .
RUSH: I identified the intruder .
SINCLAIR: Tron ? Was n't Tron one of ou programs ? Sinclair and Meg trade baffled looks .
RUSH: I have a plan to crash Tron . Mega turns with alarm .
MEGA: ABORT !
MEG: Rush ? Words appear END OF LINE .
SINCLAIR: He 'd better not fail .
RUSH: Hey ! Double points if you nail me ! Bring it on !
MEGA: He was carrying out his programming . All I/O Ports are scheduled for de- ezz .
KROD: Easy , big guy . No harm , no foul .
RUSH: D-Rezz , we can use a guy with you aw power . You ready to be a hero for X-Net ?
KROD: Cool . Now I 've got somebody I can oss around . D-rezz modem-growls at Krod .
RUSH: Let 's get to the game grid . Rush leads them up an incline .
MEGA: You have a skill for manipulating other programs .
RUSH: When do I get a shot at hacking you code ?
MEGA: Never . Our operating systems are incompatible .
RUSH: You act like I 've got a virus .
KROD: There it is .
RUSH: The place we nail Tron .
KROD: That 's good . Keep doing it . D-rezz retrieves Romball for another whack -
RUSH: Relax , buddy -
KROD: Pound him to bits , D-rezz .
RUSH: He 's wireless .
KROD: Freaky .
MEGA: Searching data bank . `` I-Beem '' . Security Specialist , damaged in service , rated unstable .
KROD: D-rezz , take out this blip .
RUSH: Hang on . I-Beem . We 're from X-Net CPU . You 're doing a great job out here . Everybody knows it .
RUSH: When did he come through last ?
MEGA: This region is obsolete .
RUSH: There 's bits of Tron 's code all over . Krod , give D-Rezz and I-beem the escape coordinate Tron used on me .
CONTINUED: 35
RUSH: That 's where Tron will bail out . We 'll make sure he needs to . Go set up the trap . You only get one shot at this , big guy . Stop him but do n't destroy him , right ? He 's got data I need .
MEGA: If this is Tron 's territory , he 'll know we 're here . He 'll hide .
RUSH: He ca n't resist a grudge match . He 'll take risks trying to beat me . That 's how we trip him up . Whip it out . Rush unsheathes his LIGHT WAND . Krod pulls out his own LIGHT WAND . They both look at Mega . She 's got no light wand .
KROD: You did n't bring one ?
MEGA: I do n't have one .
KROD: Hey , not a problem -
RUSH: Hang on , Krod .
RUSH: I upgraded my unit .
KROD: You are awesome , man . I hate you .
MEGA: Mmmm Hack me . A nod between Rush and Rush - they TAKE OFF . LIGHT CYCLES shoot across grid surface .
RUSH: Any sign of him ?
KROD: Everything looks the same to me . Everything looks the same . The same . The same .
RUSH: Krod , snap out of it .
MEGA: Tron will never expose himself . They watch , wait , pivot .
KROD: The same
MEGA: Its futile .
RUSH: Look .
KROD: Mmmm . They SPEED AWAY .
RUSH: Wuss ! You call that speed ! ?
KROD: Hey , what are you - ? ?
RUSH: WHY DID YOU DO THAT ? !
MEGA: I- I GOT SCARED !
CONTINUED: 40
KROD: There he goes !
RUSH: We 've got him now . Let 's go !
KROD: I could have done that . He strobes , freezes , hits the deck .
MEGA: We ca n't go any further .
RUSH: What is it ?
KROD: Do n't ask , dude .
MEGA: It 's a memory leak , once it starts , it infects everything .
KROD: Then it 's settled .
RUSH: Stop . Listen to me . You might not elieve there 's a world outside of this one , but let 's just say a guy named Sinclair is depending on me . If Tron got through here , then I can too . Who 's with me ?
KROD: No problem . It 's all in the velocity- vector ratio .
PLEXOR: Report .
MEGA: We interfaced with Tron . He escaped into a dark zone .
CONTINUED: 42
PLEXOR: The Random One has proven effective ?
MEGA: He is all glitches and bad data . He virtually got us de-rezzed . I ecommend we terminate this mission . Rush listens , hurt and angry .
PLEXOR: No . Proceed . If you keep Tron on the run , he can not attack X-Net .
MEGA: It 's a poor allocation of resources .
PLEXOR: You have your instructions .
RUSH: `` All glitches and bad data . '' What 's up with you ? Ever since I got here , you 've been working against me .
MEGA: I act as Plexor programs me .
RUSH: Blah blah blah . You 've got you own processor . I can feel it working overtime . Did Meg program you to mess with me ?
MEGA: I have no match for `` Meg '' -
RUSH: First , you do n't want to come with me , then you 're all over me on the light cycle - so you can dump us over and blow the plan . We would have nailed Tron by now if it was n't for you . What 's your malfunction ?
MEGA: Do n't troubleshoot me ! Angry silence . Eyes locked .
MEGA: The most effective alternative is to eturn to the main CPU and anticipate Tron 's next attack .
KROD: You ram hog ! His disk clunks him on the head .
RUSH: It 's what I 'm programmed to do .
KROD: What were you doing with her ?
RUSH: Nothing . She had a glitch . I was just pinging her EPROM .
KROD: She let you ?
RUSH: We 've got him now .
RUSH: Hey ! Pick on somebody your own size ! D-rezz is twice as big as either of them .
RUSH: Tell me , Tron ! Who programmed you ? Here 's your encryption code ! 3-6-2-
KROD: You got him !
RUSH: It 's more than I wanted . Now I 'll never know who his User is .
KROD: We 're heroes !
RUSH: Where is Mega ?
KROD: Right behind me .
RUSH: MEGA ? ?
KROD: I recognize Trouble .
RUSH: I-beem , go for help . Zap your butt out of here .
DARK FIGURE: A User shows up .
RUSH: Yeah , I 'm a User . A superior being . The first to enter this realm . And you are - ?
FLYNN: The first .
RUSH: Flynn . How can you be here ?
KROD: You know this dude ?
RUSH: Yeah , he 's a lunatic !
FLYNN: Rush Nortebi . I remember hiring you . They are equally dumbfounded .
KROD: Somebody tipped these guys off about us .
MEGA: Not soon enough .
RUSH: Thanks .
MEGA: You destroyed our last hope !
KROD: I detect a pattern in her behavior .
RUSH: She 's a spy .
MEGA: I failed our cause .
FLYNN: You did everything you could . They know each other well .
RUSH: Flynn never died Because your Quantum Digitizer worked . That 's how you got here I know - that 's how I got here too . Flynn studies Rush , anger rising .
FLYNN: The day after I hired you , you start sucking up to Sinclair . You thought I did n't know . Bet he offered you a partnership for this , right ? You have no idea the damage you 've done .
RUSH: I 'm only getting started . Man , you were the company joke . Now I see why . You melted down your lab to take this little joyride . You got stuck here so all you can do is wreck other people 's hard work .
FLYNN: Open your eyes , geek . My lab was igged . My `` death '' was no accident . I pushed the button just in time to escape Almost in time .
RUSH: You 're paranoid . Who would want you dead ?
FLYNN: The same guy I programmed Tron to shut down . Same one you 've been sucking up to . Sinclair . And his cyber-henchman , Plexor . Malicious grumbles from Fighters .
RUSH: Too many of your brain cells have gotten zapped in here , old man .
FLYNN: Rush , you lamer ! You 've been working for the bad guy .
FIGHTER ONE: He got away .
FLYNN: Let 's move . X-Net goons will soon e all over this place .
RUSH: What are they doing ? ?
FLYNN: Beating the competition . X-Takk Troops storm closer - by the hundreds .
MEGA: They 've got us outnumbered .
FLYNN: We 've got to choose our battles wisely . This way ! He leads them down a secret portal , into
KROD: Rush , why is X-Net doing this ? !
KID PROGRAM: No ! Let my daddy go !
RUSH: How long has this been going on ?
FLYNN: For years .
RUSH: Sinclair never told us about this . X-Net is creating the very terro that makes people want the security of X-net !
FLYNN: No more glitches , freeze-ups or shut- downs . Once X-Net is open , Plexo will destroy all other systems . All data flow will be controlled by his Master User -
CONTINUED: 55
RUSH: Sinclair .
FLYNN: All data flow - Sinclair 's to control and abuse . Bank accounts , medical histories , your Blockbuster account , your buying patterns , your e-mail . And to think , Rush - all this time , you 've been working 24/7 , trying to impress a him . X-Takk troops blast Captive Programs .
GPS VOICE: Turn left now . Turn right now . Left . Right . NOW !
RUSH: Sinclair betrayed me .
FLYNN: Finally you get it .
MEGA: Tron was our late hope .
RUSH: We 've got to stop this !
MEGA: Rush was trying to expose us !
FLYNN: They did n't see us . Keep moving !
RUSH: We 've got to tell people on the outside -
FLYNN: Plexor shut down all the I/O ports . Only HE communicates with the outside . Sinclair holds all the cards .
RUSH: Megan Randall sent me . Her User . She fixed your lab and sent me here to take out Tron .
FLYNN: Megan Randall ? I remember her . Smart , wise beyond her years . I ca n't believe she 'd fall fo Sinclair 's lies . He glances at Mega , then shoves Rush along .
RUSH: What happened to them ?
MEGA: Try to attack Plexor head-on , this is what happens . Because of you , there will be millions more .
FLYNN: Lock up these two . We 'll hold them for ransom . Or use them for target practice .
RUSH: Flynn . You think I 'm Sinclair 's flunky , but I 'm not .
KROD: Yeah , we 're - Sorry ?
RUSH: We were just doing a job , we had no way of knowing the truth .
KROD: No way at all .
RUSH: Flynn , I was wrong about you . You 've een doing the right thing in here . Plexor has to be shut down . Sinclai has to be exposed .
KROD: Like he said .
RUSH: Krod and I are ready to help .
KROD: We are ? Flynn puzzles over Rush .
FLYNN: Mega , what do you read in him ? Mega circles Rush , scanning his circuits .
MEGA: Independent operating instructions .
RUSH: You do n't know me .
MEGA: He can not to be trusted .
RUSH: Trust ? ! You 're the one who 's been lying to me the whole time !
FLYNN: Mega 's been risking her existence for our cause , lamer . That 's more than you 'll ever do . Lock them away !
KROD: Yo , s'up ? Eh X-Net rules , man .
RUSH: Hey Krod Shut down .
PLEXOR: You are positive Tron was destroyed ?
MARKETING VP: You 're not going to believe this !
SINCLAIR: Convince me .
MARKETING VP: Sales office has been flooded with calls . Major banks , airlines , city governments , the presidents of 26 nations - They all want to sign up for X-Net now . We 're not even on- line yet and we 're a hit !
SINCLAIR: We 're the only port in the storm . Execs cheer , trade high-fives .
PLEXOR: The User called Flynn is here .
SINCLAIR: That 's impossible .
PLEXOR: Flynn commanded the intruder Tron .
SINCLAIR: You 've got to be wrong about this .
PLEXOR: I was programmed error-free . By you . Sinclair ponders the unimaginable .
SINCLAIR: Flynn escaped ? !
PLEXOR: He leads a group who seek to prevent the opening of X-Net . The one called Rush has joined them .
SINCLAIR: Rush ? My guy ? What lies has Flynn filled him with ?
PLEXOR: Or what truths ?
SINCLAIR: This world can never know all I have done . You have a plan to contain Flynn ?
PLEXOR: Of course .
SINCLAIR: Do n't just contain him . Destroy him .
PLEXOR: Instructions received . And the one called Rush ? Sinclair mulls for two seconds , then
SINCLAIR: He knows too much . Get rid of him .
PLEXOR: Instructions received .
RUSH: Hear that , Krod ? Never let them get to your weak spot .
KROD: Gurfle ! I never knew that . Pull back to see
BOOLE: We 're ready for you now . They head upstairs .
FLYNN: If X-Net is allowed to open it 's the eginning of the end of a free and open cyberspace . We ca n't let Plexo get away with this . Our game plan has not changed . Tron was specially programmed to break into X-Net and shut down power supplies . We would then exploit these weak points and cripple the system . Tron 's role was essential One of you must take his place . He holds up Tron 's disk .
MEGA: There are other ways to crash Plexor . I will return to him , he still trusts me . I will get close and crash him with direct contact -
FLYNN: It 's futile . Plexor 's personal defense measures are massive .
FIGHTER SENTRY: Enemy scouts , headed this way !
PLEXOR: Disperse to all sectors !
CONTINUED: 65
PLEXOR: This was a preferred gaming arena for the User called Flynn . His moves are predictable , recursive , easily traced .
PLEXOR: Fan out ! Search every buffer and cache !
KROD: Dude , are we glad to see you !
PLEXOR: You destroyed Tron .
RUSH: Yes Where is Mega ?
PLEXOR: She 's not with you ?
KROD: She 's with Flynn ! I mean , totally WITH Flynn - !
RUSH: Flynn was smart enough to interrogate her first .
KROD: Right .
PLEXOR: She contains sensitive data . Flynn can not be allowed to hack her .
RUSH: Yeah , only - We kicked Flynn 's butt , too .
KROD: You should have seen it . Flynn wo n't e a problem . X-Takk Prisoners are confused .
PLEXOR: Then Why were you imprisoned ?
FLYNN: Retreat ! Over that way ! Move around their flank ! ZAP ! A Mazer blast strikes Flynn 's bad leg .
KROD: Thanks .
RUSH: I 'll never let you forget it .
KROD: Rush , we 're screwed ! Now everybody 's after us !
RUSH: Nah , we 're cool . We 're with them !
KROD: Awesome ! Can I do one ?
MEGA: Quick . This way .
PLEXOR: Mega , move aside ! I will finish him ! Instead , she shields Flynn 's body .
MEGA: Strike us down . There will always e more to oppose you . Sinclair 's circuits snap with rage .
PLEXOR: What programming has he installed in you ? ?
MEGA: Flynn ! Go with the others ! Run !
FLYNN: I 'm not leaving you with this phreak . Plexor brings back his DEATH DISK .
FLYNN: Plexor , get over the control thing . Plexor readies his disk to FIRE -
RUSH: Drop the disk ! He pivots , hurls Death Disk at Rush .
FLYNN: I 'll be damned .
MEGA: Rush ? !
RUSH: ARRGH !
PLEXOR: Raagghh !
FLYNN: Rush ! This way ! Flynn , Mega and Flynn dash across the bridge .
PLEXOR: Delete them !
BOOLE: This way ! Down the pipe !
MEGA: He 's better than I thought .
FLYNN: He 's been sent for a reason .
MEGA: What reason ?
FLYNN: Do n't know yet . Sometimes we have to trust the bigger plan . Mega struggles to compute .
RUSH: Mega ! Quick ! Jump ! But she hesitates -
PLEXOR: You committed a fatal error .
RUSH: I got it , I got it , I got it .
KROD: AWWWWWWW !
RUSH: Shove it ! Go !
KROD: I remember now ! Nothing to it !
RUSH: Check it out !
BOOLE: Look out !
RUSH: What ?
FLYNN: TURN AROUND !
KROD: I 'm cool . Not a problem .
RUSH: They took Mega .
CONTINUED: 75
FLYNN: She can handle herself for a while .
RUSH: How do we attack Plexor next ? Flynn sizes up his new convert .
QUANTZ: You 're with us now ?
BOOLE: Do you know hard it is ? Opposing the power of Plexor ?
RUSH: It 's like the forty-sixth level of ConquerDome 6.1 , while winning a side game of Tetras Ultra , doing six Instant messages and debugging a demo .
FLYNN: All at the same time .
RUSH: I 'm there . Krod too .
KROD: Say what ? Flynn accepts a handshake from Rush .
FLYNN: We 're going to need all the help we can get . Boole , can we make it to the dark zone from here ?
BOOLE: There is one possible route .
FLYNN: We 'll meet up with the code monkeys and combine forces .
FIGHTER 1: We gave it everything .
FIGHTER 2: Interface . We can resist .
FIGHTER 3: Interface .
PLEXOR: Is completion on schedule ?
MEGA: You treat me like I 've been corrupted .
PLEXOR: I can not predict the random effects Flynn might have caused in you .
MEGA: You programmed me to gathe intelligence . That 's all I 've eve done .
PLEXOR: How long have you known Flynn ?
MEGA: Enough time to gain his trust .
PLEXOR: Your behavior was highly authentic .
MEGA: To him . It had to be .
PLEXOR: Have you allowed Flynn to complete a full interface with you ?
MEGA: I am programmed to allow such access only to you , Plexor . Her eyes lock on him . He is satisfied .
PLEXOR: Flynn claims to be a User . As did the one called Rush .
MEGA: Users do not exist .
PLEXOR: You have seen nothing to make you doubt this ?
MEGA: Nothing .
PLEXOR: They possess no powers beyond those of routine Programs ?
MEGA: I have no knowledge of such powers .
PLEXOR: Still , there is something about them I can not compute . Flynn plans to attack me , does n't he ?
MEGA: Yes . And Rush will fight by his side .
PLEXOR: Where will they strike ?
MEGA: Flynn does not decide until the hou of his attack . But he trusts me completely . When he knows the place , I will know it as well .
PLEXOR: Perfect . They will be met with a final thrashing . Yes , let them come .
MEGA: Have you further instructions fo me ?
PLEXOR: None for now . But stay close .
MEGA: All events remain under your control .
RUSH: Over there !
KROD: Those Programs think they 're just eing transferred !
RUSH: Can we take out those X-Net guys ?
FLYNN: Our forces are too thin . We ca n't isk a battle that would reveal this position .
FLYNN: Good to see you guys . When did the X-Net goons start patrolling all the way out here ?
KROD: I 've seen that somewhere .
RUSH: It 's the encryption pattern on Plexor 's disk .
FLYNN: Good eyes . We 've got Mole Programs who score chunks of Plexor 's personal code anywhere they can find it . These guys fit the pieces together .
FLYNN: How many of you crashed ? Heads shake somberly .
KROD: Yow . I get tired just watching these dudes .
RUSH: Just for laughs , try putting the circle on top of the pyramid .
CODE MONKS: That 's incongruous .
RUSH: If I 'm wrong , ding me .
FLYNN: What have we got to lose ? Try it .
KROD: Good thing you did n't terminate us .
RUSH: How do we use this thing to shut down Plexor ?
FLYNN: It 's a copy of Plexor 's master key . We can break into any X-Net facility and fry the power supply .
RUSH: But once Plexor knows we have it , he 'll change the code .
FLYNN: Yep . We 've got one shot .
RUSH: Then we should take out the powe supply to Plexor 's main server .
GROUP: Yes ! Take out Plexor 's central server !
FLYNN: Hang on , guys , that 's not as easy as it sounds -
RUSH: I was inside the main server , I saw how it 's laid out .
KROD: I used to work there ! I 'll recognize where everything is !
FLYNN: Even with this key , it wo n't -
QUANTZ: We can pull it off , ca n't we Flynn ? One final assault on Plexor 's central server ?
BOOLE: Shut him down forever ?
RUSH: Of course we can . Flynn forces a smile .
FLYNN: Hey , the future depends on us . How could we fail ?
MEG: It 's almost fixed . I 'll be able to ing back Rush soon -
SINCLAIR: Excellent work . Unfortunately , I 'm shutting down this project .
MEG: What ?
SINCLAIR: Something came up . The company is at stake . I ca n't go into details .
MEG: But Rush would have no way to return !
SINCLAIR: Meg . I will never hold you esponsible . This is a tough call , ut it 's mine . Dismantle and destroy all of this equipment and software . Immediately .
MEG: Well -
SINCLAIR: Meg I 'm not asking .
MEG: I understand . He shoots a look and exits .
FLYNN: It 's a bummer being on the losing team , huh Rush ?
RUSH: We 'll trash X-Net . Then we 'll go ack to the our world and expose what Sinclair 's done .
FLYNN: Programs once connected freely with their Users . But Plexor shut down the I/O ports , severing all links . He controls all contact with the world we once knew . Programs operate on his instructions or none at all .
CONTINUED: 86
RUSH: Or yours .
FLYNN: It 's nothing to brag about . We 're getting our butts kicked .
RUSH: It there a way to contact Meg ? She can transport us back to our world . Maybe it 's better if we fight Sinclai on his own turf .
FLYNN: I gave up the idea of going back a long time ago You should too .
RUSH: What do you mean ?
FLYNN: Sinclair did n't get where he is by eing dumb . Even if we survive Plexor 's forces in here , Sinclai will make sure we never get back home .
RUSH: But Meg said -
FLYNN: I 'm sure she 'll do everything she can . It might not be enough .
RUSH: Oh , man .
FLYNN: Rush . I think Meg suspects the truth about Sinclair .
CONTINUED: 87
RUSH: I thought she hated me .
FLYNN: She believed in you more than you elieved in yourself . It sinks in . Wow .
RUSH: Do we really have a shot at winning against Plexor ?
FLYNN: We have his master key . And we have Mega working on the inside .
RUSH: Mega Are you sure about her ? I get the feeling she plays both sides .
FLYNN: Plexor programmed her to perform his will . He 's a control freak . I 'm not . I programmed her to have a will of her own . Whatever she decides , it 's up to her .
RUSH: Sounds dangerous .
FLYNN: Sometimes you 've got to trust the igger plan . Krod and Fighters approach .
FLYNN: I turbo-charged him to burn hot and urn fast . Who else could handle the operating code in this disk ? He extends the disk to Rush .
RUSH: Uhhh , I do n't think so .
BOOLE: It could mean the difference between winning and losing .
KROD: Hey , I 'll try . Rush holds off Krod , takes the disk .
RUSH: What do I do - ?
FLYNN: Steady . It 's all about giving as much as you get . Let it become a part of you .
KROD: Awesome , dude ! Do n't let go !
KROD: HE DID IT !
FLYNN: Damn , look at that He did it .
RUSH: It feels Awesome .
FLYNN: Do n't flinch , Rush ! It 's your disk now .
RUSH: Oh man , this is good .
KROD: Awwwww ! Where can I get one of those ?
BOOLE: It 's for real , Quantz .
QUANTZ: We 've got a chance to take down Plexor .
PLEXOR: Perfect . Any three of you could crash an army of Flynn 's best . But I 've prepare for his random acts by designing massive redundancy . Widen to reveal
MEG: Dewey . This your idea of a joke ?
PLEXOR: Cybavor programming complete ?
CONTINUED: 91
PLEXOR: Demonstrate .
RUSH: Do n't take this the wrong way .
KROD: Do n't drop me .
FLYNN: Rush , up there . See it ? Rush leaps to a high circuitry nexus .
RUSH: I hope you 're right about Mega .
MEGA: You . Where is Flynn ?
RUSH: We 're all here .
MEGA: I arranged for your entry . An encryption portal has been left unlocked . Path 4786324BXY . Do you know the way ?
RUSH: We got it .
MEGA: Hurry . She deactivates . Rush 's image vanishes .
PLEXOR: You contacted them .
MEGA: Yes .
PLEXOR: And ?
MEGA: I gave them the portal address . They will attempt entry soon .
PLEXOR: Perfect . We will be waiting .
FLYNN: This is all yours , Rush .
RUSH: No sweat .
MEGA: There it is . That 's the portal .
PLEXOR: Converge on all levels ! Outside patrols close in behind these coordinates ! X-Takks come from all directions , all levels .
FLYNN: Something 's up .
RUSH: Keep moving .
BOOLE: Portal 4786324BXY . This is it . Flynn withdraws the HOLOGON .
FLYNN: The sooner Rush gets this into the main power supply , the sooner X-Net shuts down . And the more of us come out of here to tell about it . Rush takes the hologon , stows it .
KROD: Oh man , I think I 'm leaking .
RUSH: Krod . You 'll do great .
KROD: Think so ?
RUSH: Your recognize patterns better than any of us . You 'll know Plexor 's moves before he does .
KROD: I hope you 're right Rush ?
RUSH: Yeah man ?
KROD: Are you really a `` User '' ? Is there such a thing ? Is that what makes you so good ?
RUSH: Flynn and I come from a realm no etter or worse than here One thing I know , neither place works unless you 're looking out for the other guy . And we 've got a word fo what all of you are .
BOOLE: Obsolete ?
RUSH: Heroes .
KROD: Cool .
QUANTZ: Let 's do it .
KROD: Nothing to it . Rush leads group inside .
PLEXOR: OPEN IT ! OPEN FIRE !
MEGA: Flynn ! Keep moving ! This way !
FLYNN: I 'm proud of you , Mega .
MEGA: I linked with MEG . Users exist . She instructed me .
RUSH: Go , Meg !
KROD: Ummmm That way !
TRON: You 're right ! There it is !
KROD: And here they come !
RUSH: Block this choke point , slow them down . Can you guys do it ?
QUANTZ: Not a problem .
KROD: Whoa ! Retreat ! That way ! Keep firing ! RUN ! AHHH !
RUSH: We have to get across .
FLYNN: ARRGGHH !
KROD: Wait ! I know that dude !
KROD: We 're taking out Plexor . You with us or them ? X-Takks attack the group , including I-beem .
FLYNN: There . You can make it across !
RUSH: You have n't got a chance by yourself .
FLYNN: Ah , these guys are wimps .
MEGA: We 're not leaving you .
FLYNN: My body is weak , but my will is strong . I promise , no matter what they do to me , I 'll survive this . Trust the bigger plan .
MEGA: But Flynn - X-Takks attack along the ledge .
FLYNN: GO ! NOW !
PLEXOR: Flynn . Your moment of obsolescence is upon you .
FLYNN: Freedom , Plexor . It 's the bette idea . That 's why Mega chose my side .
PLEXOR: If an idea is erased from all memory anks , it can be neither good no ad . When each alternative has been emoved , X-Net will simply BE .
FLYNN: Crash me . Hack me . Do what you want . The yearning for freedom will last forever .
PLEXOR: Nice speech USER !
MEGA: Noooooo ! ! ! Plexor sees Mega and Rush on the other side .
PLEXOR: Over there ! Surround them !
RUSH: We plug this into the control cell , X-Net is history .
MEGA: Let 's do it for Flynn .
RUSH: NOW !
MEGA: Over there ! The CONTROL CELL . Dead center .
RUSH: AAARRGGGHHH !
PLEXOR: Where did you get that ? ! No one knows this code but me !
RUSH: Your software has the biggest flaw there is , Plexor . You ca n't see you own mistakes .
MEGA: RUSH !
RUSH: Thanks guys .
KROD: I 'll never let you forget it . Boole tosses Rush his tron-disk .
MEGA: We 're free . At last we 're free .
SINCLAIR: In a world exposed to increasing data corruption , I hereby switch on the first global network offering 100 % guaranteed data security . Flawless performance , zero downtime . The world works hard , the world deserves
MEGA: I underestimated you . Thanks .
KROD: You knew she always liked him .
RUSH: Whoa , ouch , what ? Ahhhhh !
MEGA: Rush , what is it ?
RUSH: Guys ! Mega ! NOOO !
KROD: Help him !
QUANTZ: It 's the way it should be .
BOOLE: He 's going back to the place he elongs .
MEG: Rush . You made it !
RUSH: Like a bad cold , I 'm always coming ack .
VOICES: He made it ! Rush ! You okay ? !
RUSH: I met a program you wrote . She 's just as incredibly beautiful and confusing as you .
MEG: I know . Mega told me all about what you did in there .
RUSH: She gave you my coordinates . That 's how you uploaded me ?
MEG: Yes . Your coordinates and his . They look across the room .
THE GUY: She 's done an amazing job here , Rush .
RUSH: Flynn !
FLYNN: I told you to trust the bigger plan .
MEG: I 'd come to suspect Flynn was alive , inside . But I had no way to know for sure .
FLYNN: You picked the right guy to send in .
MEG: Working down here , I became convinced someone tried to murder Flynn . But the only person I could confide in was the guy I suspected most . Elevator opens .
SINCLAIR: What are you people doing down here ! ? ! Get back to work ! X-Net has CRASHED ! We 'll all be ruined !
FLYNN: Speak for yourself , Sinclair .
SINCLAIR: I ordered you to destroy this equipment ! Rush gets in Sinclair 's face .
RUSH: Hey , jerk , she does n't do your dirty work . Neither do I . Not anymore . You lied to me , to all of us . You want to deal with somebody ? I 'm the guy who crashed X-Net .
SINCLAIR: You 're fired , everybody get out .
FLYNN: No , Sinclair . I 'm back . And I 'm the boss again . You 're fired . Not only are you fired , you 're going to have a lot of explaining to do to the SEC , the Justice Department and the FBI . Hold him until the police get here .
CONTINUED: 111
FLYNN: X-Net is dead . But Encom lives . We 're going to bring this company ack to its place as the leader in finding the next big thing . I 'll need to be free to do the dreaming . So , effective immediately , I 'm appointing two bold , bright , courageous people to head worldwide operations .
RUSH: Cool .
MEG: I love it .
RUSH: We 'll take it . You get a division to run .
MILES: Yes . Does that mean a bigger cubicle ?
FLYNN: Put on some coffee . You two are going to be putting in a lot of overtime together . Meg turns to Rush .
MEG: Do you remember how , along time ago , you used to give me a professional congratulatory peck on the cheek ? Rush goes for the lips .

JULIE: Well , it might look like 1969 here in the tiny Southeast Asian country of Bien Den Phu , but it is 2007 , and they are making history . We are here with an E ! exclusive , the first look behind the scenes at what Hollywood insiders are calling the most expensive war movie eve produced .

SPEEDMAN: Hey , Dorf . Just wanted to call and throw a little pep talk your way . I know today was rough , and you 're probably mad at yourself for not getting the shots , but that 's the way these movies go . We all oot it from time to time , and today was just one of those days . Happens .
DAMIEN: Yes it does . It does . Though I do think you have to realize Chris , that you are somewhat responsi
SPEEDMAN: Oh , also needed to let you know , and I . .know you 're like wrapped up with the movie , but I really need that new chef like we talked about , you know to really 4 get that super-ripped thing happening . This guy is great but all he makes are dumplings . And they stiill have n't worked out the TiVo thing . III I. I I 4I
DAMIEN': Right . well those things those . 4 ,
SPEEDMAN: Yeah , of course , I just know we talked about getting super-super-ripped for that starvation sequence
PECK: I 'm looking at your ugly mug on the back of Vanity Fair magazine in beautiful living color with the two cute cuddly pandas from cuteville . It 's insane .
PECK: The credibility factor that the pandas give you is priceless , and strangely , if ' you see this picture , what really strikes me is the credibility that you give them . I 've been getting psychotic feedback all day . Hey did you get the basket I sent ?
SPEEDMAN: Yeah . Thanks .
PECK: You sad ? What 's wrong ?
SPEEDMAN: No I 'm fine . I 've just been having a tough time over here . They still hav n't got the TiVo hooked up and I do n't know Lazarus is getting all this Osca uzz already
PECK: Is that what this is about ? Crazy Kirk Lazarus goes and places his entire body in some experimental Malaysian dipping sauce so he can actually be black , of course he 's gon na get buzz . Listen to what I am telling you . He is clinically mentally not right .
SPEEDMAN: Yeah but the way they talk about him . I mean , he played a retarded guy and won an Oscar , I play a retarded guy and do n't even get a nomination . I do n't know , I mean you said `` Simple Jack '' would be my `` Elf '' but with Oscars . Those were you exact words .
PECK: I do n't believe those were my exact words ut let 's get beyond that to the root of this . Remember the moment you chose to do , this ' , and I wanted you to do the ESP obot thing with Wolfgang Petersen ? And I said stay home be happy and you said `` no , Rick I need to play a real human being '' and I said `` okay '' and then I said `` are you sure ? '' and you said that you needed this-for your soul ?
SPEEDMAN: Yes but
PECK: Which I totally respected and now you 're doing the crazy surfer three..sixty move on me , ..which I love by the-way but-you said fuck it , I got ta do it for my soul And-that 's why I hate you.. Because you were RIGHT . And you 're in . the Phuc Long fucking Delta , . in the real mud , with- leeches in your hair , 20,000 mil es from Fatburger.being an actor-And , I would wager , forcing everyone around you to ise to your level . Am I right ? I mean you are over there forcing a bunch of PUSSY actors to gel , straighten up and . ecome a platoon . And it hurts . Am I ight ? Speedman actually seems tohave bought-this
SPEEDMAN: Yeah . You are right .
PECK: Alright , that 's what.I thought . Now get to work genius soldier . I 'll handle the .TiVo . Peck hangs up abruptly .
DAMIEN: Chris ? You there ? Hello ?
DAMIEN,: Jeff . Jeff are you alright ? .We.need to talk as.a cast , as a platoon , right now .
PORTNOY: Dorfie did you happenito see that grip withthe bandana ? -The big guy ? -I was supposed to meet him here . He has a- package of mine .
BEAT: Who are you ?
SANDUSKY: I 'm Kevin . Are you serious ? Kevin Sandusky ? I 'm playing Brooklyn ?
PORTNOY: Oh yeah . Right . Hey , have you seen that grip with the bandana ?
SANDUSKY: Uh , no . I think
TOUCHED: You actually care , do n't you ?
SANDUSKY: Oh , yeah . Of course . This is a huge opportunity . To be working with all these great actors , and you .
DAMIEN: You 're the only one who auditioned . You 're the only one who did the two week oot camp , Sandusky .
SANDUSKY: Yeah , I know . It was kind of weird . Was n't the point that we were all supposed to bond ?
BITTERLY: Yes , that was the point .
SPEEDMAN: I guess I just watched some retarded people . I mean , I spent a lot . of time . with them watching them.. Watching all the retarded stuff they did .
LAZARUS: Huh , I always found mere observation a little rudimentary . Got ta dig deeper to mine the true emotional , paydirt . Diagram the source of the pain . Then live it .
SPEEDMAN: Exactly ! With Jack . I was , for the first time in-my life.. Retarded . I was retarded.in.the trailer , etarded at home. , Brushing my . teeth etarded . In a ` weird way I had to unlearn what it was to be .NOT etarded .
LAZARUS: Yeah but Simple Jack thought he was smart . Or , rather , did n't think he was etarded . So you can afford to play etarded ' , being a smart actor . Tricky tricky stuff . Hats off for going . there . Especially.knowing how the Academy is about that shit . Speedman is lost
SPEEDMAN: About what ?
LAZARUS: Are you serious ? Everyone knows you do n't ever go fully retarded !
SPEEDMAN: How do you mean ?
LAZARUS: Check it out . Dustin Hoffman , Rain Man . Looked retarded . Acted retarded . NOT etarded . He could count toothpicks , cheat at cards . Autistic . Sure . NOT etarded . HANKS ' . Forest Gump . Slow ? Yes .
LAZARUS: You went full retard , man . You never go 14 full retard . Do n't believe me ? Ask Sean Penn , 2001 , I am Sam . Went full retard . Went home empty handed .
DAZED: Oh .
DAMIEN: Redykulous I need to talk to you .
REDYKULOUS: What up , money .
DAMIEN: We 're having a cast meeting , right now We need to come together as a unit
REDYKULOUS: Uh-huh
DAMIEN: From theuhyou know .this area..
REDYKULOUS: No .
DAMIEN: What ?
REDYKULOUS: No . I ca n't do that . If Redykulous steps away from the cameras then my .people do n't get to see the real Redykulous . The show is called `` Utterly Redykulous '' .
DAMIEN: Well this is about work my show so to . .speak . Do you understand ?
REDYKULOUS: I guess . But not really . Your show and my show are the same thing . This is gon na help your show , trust me .
DAMIEN: Excuse me , everyone ! If I could have your attention !
UNRAVELING: Not to mention my entire bloody life !
SPEEDMAN: `` When we.'.. put aside our differences we see we 're kind of the same . '' Within moments , the place settles completely .
SPEEDMAN: I was looking-at it all backwards . You guys are lost . You heed.me to.lead you , to help you gel , and straighten.up like a PLATOON ! A long beat .
PORTNOY: Hey , . Speedman ! That bullshit pep'talk made me.H-h-h-h-h-happy !
FOUR LEAF: You do n't know which way is up , do you private ` ? You could n't find a dixie coonskin with an Ohio hooker holding you prick . and showin ' you the way Damien does n't know what the fuck that meant .
FOUR LEAF: A raindrop can not carve a valley . An ant can not defeat a buffalo . But a tempest can cleave that mountain to make the valley , and an army of ants can fell the mighty buffalo .
DAMIEN: Yes
FOUR LEAF: If the lion , although king of the jungle , is thrown into the sea , he will drown butif
PAUSE: Helives in thewater , for many years , he will.. .grow gills . do you understand ?
DAMIEN: I want to ! ! ! But not really ! !
BEAT: Someone 's an ANT ? Or something ? ? ?
FOUR LEAF: I put my story in your limp Brit hands and you will not fail me ! ! My boys were worse pussies than these guys . But the shit is what made us a unit . A whole . You must put them in the
DAMIEN: And ?
FOUR LEAF: Rig up your documentary cameras'in that jungle , give me and Cody a few of those smoke bombs and some charges and we could light up the jungle so those lily-dick actors would think they were in the middle of . Hamburger Hill . You.get them thinking they 're getting shot at , and you 'll have your movie .
DAMIEN: I see yes They would 'be under my total control finally . I could shoot the whole movie there . Gritty . Dirty . Away from their pampered pussy posses and helpers
FOUR LEAF: Yes yes
DAMIEN: Put them in the real shit . Film them with real fear in their eyes . REAL FEAR !
FINALLY: So , uh , any idea how long we 'll be gone ? Because I left most of my vitamins ack at the hotel .
FOUR LEAF: Save your breath , maggots !
DAMIEN: That'sâ€¢right . Maggots .
PORTNOY: This is bullshit !
SPEEDMAN: Whoa .
SUBTITLES: < We have heard an explosion , in the northern sector .
CODY: So , I 'm thinkin ' as soon as Damien gives us the go ahead , we ' ï¿½ust their cherry with a few airbursts , then alpha-alpha till they come running right at , us , then a good of fashioned firefight , maintaining our distance .
FOUR LEAF: I do n't know what it 's called . I just know the sound it makes when it takes a man 's life . Cody , a little spooked , picks up his radio .
CODY: Ok , we 're ready to rock and roll . Damien , come in . Cameras are up , ordinance are up . Ready to kick the tires and light the fires on your say so .
PORTNOY: I think he 's like dead .
REDYKULOUS: I do n't think he 's hiding.. I think he just died !
SANDUSKY: He does n't . have a pulse or a head .
REDYKUZOUS: You bet your ass it is . That 's why a percentage of my Pymp Sweat Profits are helpin ' solve the problem !
SPEEDMAN: C'mon ! Do n't you get it ? This is what .Dorf was talking about our slice of the Nam ! He 's trying to get in ou heads !
LAZARUS: Are you nuts , shithead ? The dude is dead ! !
SPEEDMAN: Kirk . I know you 're the big fancy acto here , but , no offense , I 've done a lot mote effects driven event films , and I think I can spot a prop body .
SMIRKING: Alright , can we start the scene now ? O do you need a formal invitation ? ! Scene 12A , ext . Jungle . Day . Ambush .
SPEEDMAN: I got a baaaad feeling on this one , Fats .
SANDUSKY: Me too , cap ' n .
BEAT: Hey , cap ? If.I told you something , something kinda personal , you would n't think I was crazy , right ?
SPEEDMAN: Naw , man . I know you ai n't crazy Brooklyn
SANDUSKY: Well , . if I told you that I , I neve actually , well , been with a girlyou would n't , like , think I was , like , quee .or nothin ' would you . ?
SPEEDMAN: .Naw , man I would n't think you was a queer .

REDYKULOUS: ( acting really `` black guy ''
SCARED: Shshshit When I get back to the world , I 'm gon na find me the finest piece of Detroit nubian mugambo , and fuck it till I broke its back .
PORTNOY: The last `` mugambo '' you ever tasted was in your momma 's soup bowl . I would n't mind slurpin ' on a little of that
SPEEDMAN: That 's enough outta you Fats . Do n't you worry , Brooklyn . You got ta lotta days a fucking ahead of you and I for one ai n't gon na let Charlie Lazarus ca n't handle it anymore .
LAZARUS: What the FUCK is wrong with you people ? !
SPEEDMAN: Sorry Damien ! Back to one action ! Do n't you worry , Brooklyn , You got ta
LAZARUS: Yo , asshole ! Mothafucka just DIED ! Speedman sighs , annoyed .
SPEEDMAN: How many more takes you wan na wreck ? Some of us are taking this seriously .
LAZARUS: Jaysus ! There is n't going to be any movie , ya gobshite !
PORTNOY: i Wow . That was really cool .
THE GUERILLAS: Are watching this , poised to attack .
SPEEDMAN: Excuse me Kirk , I think you dropped something . He mimes picking something , off , the ground .
SANDUSKY: I think they 're really shooting at us !
SPEEDMAN: What are you guys worried about ? These guys are pros . The unions would tea them a new ass-if any of us got hurt . The actors stay down , looking scared .
FOUR LEAF: Hear that ?
CODY: What ? I still ca n't get Damien on the adio . I bet he forgot how to use the Walkie again . What do you say we get a little pro-active ? Cody , very excited , grabs a plunger .
ON CODY: He pushes down the plunger
CODY: Right on ! ! I bet Damien heard that ! .
FOUR LEAF: Oh yeah .
PUMPED: Aaaaand CUT ! Jesus ! . Alright ! That 's the trailer 'right there !
REDYKULOUS: That was some sick shit ! I was n't even thinking bout the camera !
SANDUSKY': So what do we do now ? Speedman pulls out the map , frowns at it .
SPEEDMAN: Damien said to head north . I 'm guessing they 've got more of these `` battles '' and Viet Congs rigged for uls on the way . Alright , let 's hump-our shit to D'ang Kwook ! Let 's didi double time ! We got a lot of clicks to cover !
SANDUSKY: UhSir , is n't it that way ?
SPEEDMAN: Oh yeah . Thanks , uh
SANDUSKY: Kevin . Kevin Sandusky .
SPEEDMAN: Right . Okay , To D'ang Kwook ! Lets do-it- to-it !
PORTNOY: So we 're just supposed to keep walking ?
SPEEDMAN: We 'll see some action soon enough . And try to stay in character . We 're on camera..
PORTNOY: What do you mean `` soon '' ?
,I: Tropic Thunder 51 .
SPEEDMAN: Whenever Damien decides it 's time , I guess .
PORTNOY: When 's that ?
SPEEDMAN: I do n't know . That 's the whole point . Damien wants us tired and confused .
REDYKULOUS: Yeah , well I 'm definitely qualifying fo those objectives .
SPEEDMAN: Fine , fine . Okay , let 's take a break , ut be on the lookout for anything . Charlie does n't care if you 're on a break or not .
LAZARUS: Speedman is watching . I do n't have much time . I do n't really need to piss . I need to talk to you . You went to the oot camp Sandusky , right ? You can read that map ?
SANDUSKY: Yeah
LAZARUS: Good , good . Speedman is a tosser . That hoor 's melt really thinks this is a movie . And he 's got the lot of ya convinced .
SANDUSKY: You saying you don'tithink they 're filming us ?
LAZARUS: Of course not ! It 's only a matter of time before he walks us into more mines or more of whoever the hell was shootin ' , at us . That muppet 's going to get us all killed . I need to convince everyone.to turn around , but I .ca n't do it without the map . You 're the only one who can ead it . Can I count on you ?
SANDUSKY: Well , yeah , I.guess . But
LAZARUS: Good man , Good man .
SPEEDMAN: I 'm gon na level with you , bro . I do n't need to pee . I need to talk to you .
SANDUSKY: Kevin .
SPEEDMAN: Good man . Good man .
SICK: No its just that I do n't feel so hot I left my medication at the hotel .
REDYKULOUS: Yeah , I 'd like to check out some of those `` meds '' for my own self . Lazarus moves up to Speedman .
LAZARUS: Look , ya eejit , I mean , if there was a village do n't you think we would have hit it by now ?
SPEEDMAN: Quit your carping , we 're right where we 're supposed to be !
LAZARUS: . Hey , Is there a feckin ' river on that map ? S.pee ` dman refers to the'now sopping wet map .
SPEEDMAN: Yes ! There is ! Its just a little more ' down to the lefty-down part from the village . Anyway , . this feels like the Sampan , Boat Raid at the end of the second act .
LAZARUS: I do n't see a `` Sampan '' boat !
SPEEDMAN: Any second now one should come by . Alright men , into the water !
LAZARUS I: - L-et-'-s-stop this-char-ade- , sha-l-l-we ? We need to quit faffin ' about and turn . around NOW ! And Lazarus grabs Sandusky .
LAZARUS: Sandusky agrees . with me . Do n't you , Sandusky ? Kevin is caught , not sure what to d
SPEEDMAN: Wait ! First of all Now Speedman grabs him .
LAZARUS: No , yer an actor . Arid if memory serves , a pretty shite one .
SPEEDMAN: THAT 'S THE WAY OUT ! That 's our only chance !
PORTNOY: Yeah , but maybe we should stay here until they send help ! Or maybe try to get back to the hotel .
SPEEDMAN: Help from where ! Need I remind you that Damien 's orders were to stay in character . Now , I already have an international box office presence , but for some of you , I 'm guessing you might not want to screw this movie up !
LAZARUS: Jay-sus Fuck ! It 's Viet Cona ! Not Viet Congs ! Viet Cong , you plunker ! And , hey , if you 're so sure of yourself , why do n't you let Kelvin have a look at the map ? !
SPEEDMAN: Be my guest .
SANDUSKY: We 've been going the wrong way . 'We were supposed to be doing this
PORTNOY: Oh , man , this is not ' cool , this is not cool at all . Speedman grabs the map back from Sandusky .
SPEEDMAN: I ca n't believe you people ! . You 're pussing out on me ? We are supposed to be a unit !
LAZARUS: No one is `` pussing out . '' They just prefer not . to die.out here . Sandusky , can you get'us back to the landing zone without the map ?
SANDUSKY: It might be tricky , but maybe .
LAZARUS: Okay , which is it , gentlemen ? Playin ' wa with Mister Box Office ? Or staying alive ?
SPEEDMAN: Unbelievable ! . Are you guys really gon na abandon this movie ?
BREATH: And when I give my acceptance speech , I 'll be sure to thank you , Lazarus , fo staying out of that scene . And come Osca night , we 'll see who feels a little `` full etard '' ! He reaches the other side of the river .
SANDUSKY: Chris , You have no idea where you 're going !
SPEEDMAN: Yeah , I do ! I 'm going to `` EX 'S . JUNGLE . DUSK . FOUR LEAF PINNED DOWN AND ALONE '' . And , I can shoot it alone . They'watch him trudge into the foliage .
SPEEDMAN: DORF ! CODY ? ! What 's the deal with a meal break ? Are they gon na chopper stuff in later on ? I do n't wan na be a prima donna or anything , but , we got ta eat , ight ?
PAUSE: Damien ?
PORTNOY: Uhhh .UHHHHHHHH .
PAUSE: Ohhhhh-MaaaaaaannnI 'm cold . It 's
PORTNOY: Ohhh GOD ! Is'anybody BOILING ! ? It 's like a sweat lodge out here !
LAZARUS: Make a note gentlemen , . unwittingly , Jeffrey Portnoy is joining the proud anks of those of us who have suffered for art . A new frontier for you , Funny Man . When this is all over , you might have more than flatulence to offer an audience . Portnoy looks a little hurt .
REDYKULOUS: You know what ? I think I actually liked you better when you were a nigga .
LAZARUS: You know , Redykulous ' , I respect what it is you do , the rapping , the rhyme-talking invented by the Irish I might add .
REDYKULOUS: `` Why '' ? ! I dunnomaybe because they had one good part for a black man in this movie and they gave it to a white guy .
LAZARUS: OhI seePut another way you 're mad because I can act `` black '' better than you can .
SANDUSKY: Take it easy guys
REDYKULOUS: You better rein in 'black like me ' ove here , before I put a foot in his white ass
LAZARUS: Niggaz always got to be niggaz .
SANDUSKY: Okay ! That 's enough ! Jesus Christ ! It 's not enough we have people shooting at us ! Now we have to kill each other ? ! Let 's pull it together ! This place is full of land mines ! Or does n't anyone 's sense memory recall our director being blown up by onel ? That shut them up .
LAZARUS: Sandusky is right we could all learn a little from his common sense approach . From now on we walk Indian style , footstep upon footstep . Sandusky . . .you take first position .
SPEEDMAN: Die ! Die , you son of a bitch ! Die !
RICK: I got the personal attache of Bien Den Phu 's ambassador to the United Nations of America delivering a TiVo directly to your bedroom . But the bad news is you got ta sit down and have monkey brains with him or some ceremonial shit for the local paper .
FREAKED: I killed one rick . The thing I love more than anything in the world
RICK: A hooker ? You killed a hooker ? Calm down , it 's fine . This is a no-brainer . Thank GOD you 're out of the country .

LAZARUS: What 's wrong with him ?
LYING: Nothing ! Probably just the beginning stages of some . kindajungle fever . More bad noises .
PORTNOY: If we can work out some rig to carry mï¿½ ? I think it might subside in a little bit No one touches him .
LAZARUS: Alright . Sandusky ? Sandusky looks up at him . Is he serious ?

REDYKULOUS: Yeah , and I do n't wan na spend anothe minute getting the full on smell ' o vision in this hole with his stinky ass .

REDYKULOUS: Besides , how could we possibly rescue him ? Get real , Sandusky , we do n't know what the fuck we doing out here .
SANDUSKY: We 've gotten this far . Look , we 're making a movie about one of the greatest rescues ever . It 's a true story , , right ? I mean , those guys were n't superheroes ! They were just put in extra-ordinary circumstances , and they rose to the occasion .
PORTNOY: Yeah , but they were trained soldiers . They knew how to take care of themselves .
SANDUSKY: And we do n't ? They believed they could do it . They believed in each other . Look , I 'm not saying it 's gon na be easy .
BEAT: I mean , some of us might not come back .
REDYKULOUS: You mean , like , not on the same flight ?
SANDUSKY: Jeff I know this is really hard fo you , .â€¢but you 're gon na have to kick some time , and it might as well be now . Kirk , I 've always admired you as an actor . But as a person , I have to say , not that impressive . ' You got a.few Oscars . Got any balls ? Lazarus takes this in .
REDYKULOUS: Shit . I only wish they was filming this for my show . I 'm in .
LAZARUS: We could fooster about for donkey 's years..Let 's quit acting the maggot and nix that mentaller .

His career 's been in a death spiral since Simple Jack , so why do n't you all go fuck yourselves ! Oh , and I bet he has n't even told you about the whole panda thing ! He killed a panda ! And next time you 're at a cocktail party with Paris Hilton , or at Kate Mantellini 's choking down some egg whites with Ron Howard , DO N'T LET THAT SLIP , because chances are , I ALREADY DID ! Rick slams the phone down .
LAZARUS: Jaysus ! We 're too late . They brained him !
REDYKULOUS: He 's right , man , that ai n't right . Messin ' with a man 's brain .
SANDUSKY: We got ta get him outta there
SANDUSKY': Here 's us . Here 's the compound.Here 's where Speedman was . It looks like they move him at night , cause he 's not here now . Unfortunately we have no idea what the layout of that place is .
PORTNOY: I got an idea . Everyone turns to Portnoy .
REDYKULOUS: Crazy is better than nothin ' .
SANDUSKY: What is it ?
PORTNOY: Back in '98 , I did a low budget titty comedy for skinemax , `` Sex Camp '' . Anyway , me and the campers from the uncool camp had to break into the rich girls ' camp . So we did it by building a catapult . They shot us over the wall and we parachuted down .
LAZARUS: That 's the stupidest idea I 've eve heard .
SANDUSKY: Yeah . Sorry Portnoy . That 's lame . I say we wait till just before dawn and sneak over the fence . Take our chances . You guys ok with that ? The group nods in approval .
PORTNOY: I 'm not gon na make it .
SANDUSKY: Yes you are .
PORTNOY: Then you got ta tie me up . I 'm serious . Tie me to a tree . No matter how much I scream , or however much-I plead , you.must not untie me . I will be cunning , I will e in pain , and Iwill lie . The devil works this way . I will say , do , and excrete many regrettable things . But.no matter what.. .you must leave me alone . Beat..
SANDUSKY: Okay.. .Lazarus , you heard him . Tie him up . We 'll get you through it .
BODYGUARD: JackI could never go -to the county ho- down with you . I would be laughed out of town . And what would Chet say ? The bodyguards laugh woodenly at Speedman .
SPEEDMAN: B-b-b-b-but I am a G-g-g-ggggoood Dd-d-d- d-dancer .
BODYGUARD: Go do your chores , slowpoke ! !
FOUR LEAF: That poor bastard . Looks like they coo- coo nested him .
IMPATIENT: So what 's the plan ?
FOUR LEAF: What plan ?
CODY: To get us out of here ? Come on man , yoi4 lived this , you got ta have an idea of how we can get out of here ? Right ? Four Leaf looks a little at a loss
FOUR LEAF: Sometimes the flowing stream can only move when the water dries up .
CODY: No offense , but what the hell does that mean ?
FOUR LEAF: It means I 'm , sick of your yappin ' !
CODY: Come on man , you heard him back there . They wan na off us ! We got ta escape ! You
FOUR LEAF: I got ta what ? Take on the whole compound y myself !
CODY: Stop it man ! You 're chokin ' me !
SANDUSKY: Wow .look at all those stars . Makes a guy feel pretty small .
REDYKULOUS: Yup .
SANDUSKY: Back in LA , we do n't get stars like this . I wonder why there are so many here ?
REDYKULOUS: Man , how can ; , you be talking about stars ? We might not make it outta here tomorrow .
SANDUSKY: I do n't know . I give us pretty good odds .
REDYKULOUS: Nothin'..
REDYKULOUS: I 'm just thinking about Lill Kantankerous Bitch .
SANDUSKY: Who ?
REDYKULOUS: She 's a rapper I 'm producing , a twelve year old girl . Her first single drops tomorrow and I 'm not even gon na be there to see it .
SANDUSKY: You did that ?
REDYKULOUS: Well , not literally , she was trapped in a dead end record deal with Rick Rubin . Did n't even have a lawyer . Huh . And here I am on the other side of the world . About to die for a guy I barely even know . Makes Redykulous wonder what 's it all about .
SANDUSKY: Yeah . . .well at least you have someone to think about .
REDYKULOUS: You single ?
SANDUSKY: Yeah , .I guess . I dunno . I got a girl . But it 's not too serious .
REDYKULOUS: Hey , it 's cool.. I think you 're extremely lovable . Weird silence .
SANDUSKY: What ?
REDYKULOUS: I mean like like , . I know what you mean . I have love problems myself !
SANDUSKY: .No you do n't . What would the great Redykulous , know about Girl Problems . You 're ten girls deep 24 hours a day !
REDYKULOUS: .That 's the problem . Silence .
SANDUSKY: How do you mean ?
REDYKULOUS: Jeesus , I ca n't believe I 'm gon na tell you this Beat .
SANDUSKY: What ? But
REDYKULOUS: I know-impossible huh . That 's what I say sometimes , but its true . Talk abort living a loveless life . At least you have someone who loves you . I do n't even have that .
SANDUSKY: All this from the same guy who wrote '' Niggaz Got ta Bust a Nut on a Ho '' .
REDYKULOUS: Yeah , well , let me let you in on a big secret .
SANDUSKY: So what ! You 're gay ! You 're also a great artist and-businessman why not rap about that ? ï¿½u IÂ° I . 11ï¿½jm
REDYKULOUS: Yeah right . And watch my clothing line , e4ï¿½ sports drink , jewelry , nutrition , bars , and fragrances go south ? It 's all such a lie .
REDYKULOUS: ( muffled , crying in his
SHOULDER: If you tell anyone I 'll have someone shoot your . ass .
SANDUSKY: I 'm not gon na tell anyone , and your not gon na shoot me .th-at 's itl-et -tout . Redykulous pulls back , and collects himself .
REDYKULOUS: Aww shit I ca n't . believe it 's possibly the last day of my life , and I 'm not even gon na be able to let my fans know how truly 'Utterly Redykulous I eally am .
SANDUSKY: Listen , I know how utterly Redykulous you are . Even for just.thisone moment . . .and sometimes that enough .
REDYKULOUS: Thanks man .
CODY: So all of `` Tropic Thunder '' is bullshit ?
FOUR LEAF: No ! Four Leaf and his men were real , it happened !
CODY: Are you even a VET ! ?
FOUR LEAF: YES ! Well no ! I mean , kinds ! Yeah ! Not exactly . I served honorably in what they called the `` forced service '' . Sanitation Detail at the United States Pentagon .
CODY: So you were some two bit criminal who got caught and sentenced to clean toilets at the Pentagon ? I IDOLIZED YOU MAN !
FOUR LEAF: God-dammit , would you LISTEN ! I was a fuckup , sure , but one day as I was cleaning the office of some Top-Brass big- wig , I came across a file headed for the shredder marked top secret . It was Fou Leaf Tayback 's file . A nobody . No family . Nothing . Killed in Action . They were gon na bury the whole thing . Total black op .
CODY: So you decided to take his identity ?
FOUR LEAF: NO ! I gave him one ! I wrote the story And I gave the American people a hero ! Yes , I am not technically Four Leaf , but if I did n't pretend to be him then nobody woulda ever known who he was ! See what I 'm sayin ' ?
CODY: And you cashed in !
FOUR LEAF: I was a fuck up my whole life ! This guy had a story worth-telling , and nobody woulda ever known !
PORTNOY: I 'm clean ! I 'M CLEAN ! ! ! ! !

REDYKULOUS: What 's wrong with him ?
SANDUSKY: I think he thinks he 's Simple Jack . Like from the movie ?
LAZARUS': Shite . I was afraid of this . The same thing happened to me when I played Neil Armstrong in `` Moonshot '' . They found me in an alley in Burbank re-entering the Earth 's atmosphere in an old refrigerato ox .
REDYKULOUS: I heard that movie was good .
SANDUSKY: Can you fix him ? !

SANDUSKY: Kirk , this is NOT the time !
LAZARUS: And I guess when you-do themath .and oil it all down , I 've invented myself so many times .became so many people .that at the end of the.dayI 'm
REDYKULOUS: That 's right ! We're.not what we 're called , or who we pretend to be . We are what we are in our hearts . And to me , looking into your heart , you 're a hero.. Lazarus looks to Redykulous .

JUNO: I agree .
HARRY: That 's right . They want something dramatic . I spoke to a number of people who said you 're the one to see .
JUNO: So what did these people say about me exactly ?
HARRY: Let 's see that you can read ancient Sanskrit without having to sound out the words . And that other dealers and archeologists do n't like you much .
HARRY: She 's importing stuff from all over the mid-east .
GIB: She could be moving money , guns . Anything .

JUNO: It 's a good thing you pay me well .
MALIK: Do you realize that there are surveillance teams watching this place right now ? Your phones are almost certainly tapped . And you are busy laughing and flirting like a whore with this Renquist , who may be a
JUNO: No . He checked out okay Malik slaps her again .
MALIK: That is for interrupting . And that is for being wrong . We do not tolerate mistakes . Juno bites her lip .
JUNO: What do you want me to do ?

HARRY: And you have a reputation as someone who gets what she wants .
JUNO: Yes , I do .
GIB: Harry , this is your conscience speaking
JUNO: Look at this . People who dies twenty centuries ago .

SEVEN: Copy that . We 're rolling .
GIB: Helen 's going to be pissed .
HARRY: See , that 's the problem with terrorists . They 're really inconsiderate when it comes to people 's schedules .
GIB: You do n't smoke , dickhead .
GIB: There 's another guy , still in the car .
HARRY: Stay on him .
GIB: Helen ? Hi , it 's Gib . Harry emembered something he left at the office . You know Harry .

HELEN: No you 're not . You 're going to stay here until your father gets home and have cake !
DANA: Mom , wake up ! Dad barely knows we exist .
HELEN: That 's not true , honey
DANA: It is true ! He does n't know anything about me . He still thinks I 'm like ten years old o something . As long as I just smile and say yes to whatever he says , like his good little fantasy daughter , he thinks everything 's fine . But it 's not fine . Nothing 's fine .
HELEN: Dana ! Come back here ! The slamming door is her answer .
GIB: Oh shit . Harry , I lost the third guy . Harry ?

HELEN: I 'll just be a second . So what happened tonight at the office ?
HARRY: I could n't believe it . I go back to get this report I need , right , and the phone is ringing , so like a bonehead I answer it
HELEN: What 'd you do , honey ?
HARRY: Well I pull out the manual on their setup , which is the new 680 server
HELEN: It sounds wild . So now you 're a ig hero , right ? For fixing their system .
HARRY: Uh huh .
HELEN: My husband the hero .
GIB: Hey , did that guy Harry chased last night call in to give himself up yet ? Cause apparently that 's the only way we 're going to catch the son of a bitch
HARRY: Okay . Here she comes .
GIB: Goddammit ! That 's outrageous .
DANA: Oh my God ! I think that 's my dad !
TRENT: Hang on !
HARRY: So , you wan na play huh ? You little
GIB: That 's it . Get 'im Harry We 'll teach that little puke not to signal .
HARRY: Son of a bitch !
GIB: Can we go to the office now , Mr. Superspy ?
HARRY: That 's him .
FAISIL: Now he 's formed his own splinte faction called CRIMSON JIHAD .
GIB: Guess he thought the othe terrorist groups were too warm and fuzzy for his taste .
TRILBY: Why ?
TRILBY: This is impressive , gentlemen . Of course , it would have been even more impressive if you actually knew where he was .
HARRY: We 'll get him .
TRILBY: Yes . You will . Harry , I still want you in charge , even though your cover is lown . Just keep a low profile . I generally prefer it when my covert operations do n't make the front page .
GIB: What 's going on ?
HARRY: Look , uh I 've got to talk to Helen about this thing with Dana . I 'm just going to run in and see if she can get away for lunch .
GIB: You want me to just hang ?

ALLISON: Just an hour ? You should tell this stud to take more time .
HELEN: Will you shutup . I should neve have told you about him .
GIB: You look like you got gut-kicked . What 's the matter ? You sick ? Harry leans against the car for support .
HARRY: He Helen . Helen it 's Helen . It 's Helen , Gib .
GIB: Something to do with Helen , is what I 'm getting .
HARRY: She 's having an affair .
GIB: Congratulations . Welcome to the club .
HARRY: It ca n't be . Not Helen .
GIB: Nobody believes it can happen to them .
HARRY: It ca n't be .
GIB: Same thing happened to me with wife two . I had no idea until I came home and the house was empty . I mean empty . She even took the ice-cube trays from the fridge . What kind of person would think of that ?
HARRY: I still do n't believe it .
GIB: Relax . Helen still loves you . She just wants this guy to bang her . It 's nothing serious . You 'll get used to it after a
GIB: What'dya expect Harry ? She 's a flesh and blood woman . And you 're never there . It was only a matter of time .
HARRY: Put a tap on her phone .
GIB: What 're you talking about ? We have that .
HARRY: Helen 's phone . Her office line and the line at my house .
HARRY: Yeah , and we do it twenty times a day . Do n't give me that crap . Just put on the taps . Now .
GIB: Sure , Harry . I 'm on it .
HARRY: How was school today ?
DANA: Fine .
HELEN: So . You came by to see me today ? She is a too casual , masking her nervousness .
HARRY: I was in the area , and I thought you might like to have lunch .
HELEN: They must 've just missed me .
HARRY: They said you had to run out .
HELEN: Yeah . It was a rush thing . They needed some documents down at the court house . I barely made it .
HARRY: So , a little excitement in an otherwise dull day . Did is work out okay ?
HELEN: Oh , sure . Fine . I 'll get some more gravy .
DANA: I 'm done .
HELEN: Hello ?
SIMON: Helen ? It 's Simon . Is it safe to talk ?
HELEN: Yes . Go ahead .
SIMON: I ca n't talk long . Can you meet me for lunch tomorrow ? I must see you .
HELEN: Yes . I suppose so . Where ?
SIMON: The same place . One o'clock . I have to go now . See you tomorrow . Remember , I need you .
HARRY: I thought we might have lunch tomorrow .
HELEN: I ca n't , honey . I promised Allison I 'd go shopping with her . Sorry .
HARRY: No problem .
GIB: Look , Harry . I know this is ough . I felt the same way the first time it happened to
GIB: Okay , she 's turning on Seventeenth . Make a left , you should see her . Harry makes the turn .
HARRY: There she is .
SIMON: Are you sure you were n't followed ?
HELEN: I kept looking back , like you taught me . I did n't see anyone .
SIMON: Okay . It 's just , things are a it hot for me right now . If I get a signal I may have to leave suddenly .
HELEN: I understand .
SIMON: It 's my job to risk my life , but not yours . I feel bad about inging you into this , but you 're the only one I can trust .
GIB: Guy 's a spook !
GIB: He could be working her to get to you . Harry waves his hand , silencing Gib .
SIMON: Did you read the papers yesterday ?
HELEN: Yes .
SIMON: Sometimes a story is a mask fo a covert operation . See two men killed in a restroom , and two
HELEN: That was you ? !
SIMON: You recognized my style . See , you 're very good . You 're a natural at this .
GIB: The guy 's a fake ! He 's taking credit for our moves .
HELEN: Tell me what happened ?
SIMON: I 'm sorry , I ca n't .
HELEN: You can trust me completely .
SIMON: I know . But it would compromise your safety too much to know certain things .
HELEN: Right , of course . I was worried when I did n't hear from you that night .
SIMON: It 's strange . I knew I was in a woman 's thoughts when I was shooting it out with those assassins .
GIB: Unbelievable .
HELEN: And you chased one ?
SIMON: Something came over me , I just
HELEN: What is it you want me to do ?
SIMON: Not here . I 'll call you and we 'll rendezvous again . We have to leave separately , so we are n't seen together . Fo your safety .
HELEN: You 'll call me then ?
SIMON: Yes . Now go .
GIB: He 's a goddamn used car salesman . This just gets better . Sorry Harry , I know this is painful .
SIMON: It 's a great little bar , Amanda , you 'd love it . Beirut 's a great
DOUG: Simon , look out there . You see that man ? Notice how he 's looking at the cars . He 's called a customer . I know it 's been a while , but do you remember what you 're supposed to do when we have a customer ?
SIMON: It wants you too . Feel it vibrate ? How about a little spin ?
HARRY: Absolutely .
SIMON: Well then this is a vital piece of equipment . Used properly , it can change your life . See , you cruise . No racing . This ai n't a Ferrari . You check out the scenery , let the scenery check you out . You got to take it slow . Old cars are like good women they heat up fast .
HARRY: Keep talking .
SIMON: Let 's face it , Harry , the Vette gets 'em wet . But it 's not enough . If you want to really close escrow , you got ta have an angle .
HARRY: And you 've got one .
SIMON: It 's killer . Look at me I 'm not that much to look at . No eally . I can be honest . But I got 'em lining up , and not just skanks , either . Some are .
HARRY: So what 's your angle ?
SIMON: Sorry . Trade secret .
HARRY: Sure . Set me up and then do n't tell me . Simon leans forward , conspiratorially .
SIMON: Okay , just ask yourself . What do women really want ? You take these bored housewives , married to the same guy for years . Stuck in a rut . They need some elease . The promise of adventure . A hint of danger . I create that for them .
HARRY: So you 're basically lying you ass off the whole time ? I could n't do it .
SIMON: Well , think of it as playing a ole . It 's fantasy . You have to work on their dreams . Get them out of their daily suburban grind for a few hours .
HARRY: Is n't that hard to keep up , in the long run ?
SIMON: Does n't matter . I like change . You know , constant turnover . As soon as I close the deal , it 's one of two more times , then adios .
HARRY: Use 'em and lose 'em .
SIMON: Exactly . The trick is , you got ta pick your target . They have to e nice little housewife types . School-teachers . But , I 'm telling you , you get their pilot lit , these babes , they can suck- start a leaf-blower .
HARRY: What about the husbands ?
HARRY: Those idiots .
SIMON: I always have a couple on the hook . You know . There 's one ight now , I 've got her panting like a dog . It 's great .
HARRY: What does she do ?
SIMON: Some kinda legal secretary of something . Married to some oring jerk .
HARRY: But with you , she gets to be hot , ight ?
SIMON: Red hot . Her thighs steam .
HARRY: Sooooo she 's pretty good in ed , then ?
SIMON: Hey , slow down you 're gon na miss the turn !
HARRY: Let me think about it . Hold it a day for me ? Simon grins and winks .
SIMON: Because it 's you .
HELEN: Dinner 's in the warmer . Tell your father I may be late .
DANA: Where are you going ?
HELEN: Out .
GIB: Here 's today 's transcripts . There 's nothing interesting .
SIMON: Nothing from Simon ?
HARRY: Give me the page .
GIB: What are you talking about ?
HARRY: It skips from page nine to eleven . Where 's page ten ?
GIB: Aw , it 's got ta be a typo
GIB: Okay . Here .
SIMON: Helen . I need your help . Can you meet me tonight ? INTERCUT WITH HELEN at her office .
HELEN: What 's happened ?
GIB: The purse is still at the house .
HARRY: Unit Two ? Unit Seven ?
FAISIL: Seven here .
UNIT TWO: This is Two .
HARRY: Immediate roll . Acquire subject
FAISIL: Roger , One . Rolling .
UNIT TWO: Copy that .
GIB: Wait a minute ! Are you out of your mind ? You ca n't pull agents off a priority surveillance to follow your wife ! It 's gross misappropriation of Sector 's esources , it 's it 's a breach of national security .
HARRY: Whatya going to do ? Tell ?
GIB: Goddamnit , Harry . This is ou utts . So your life is in the toilet . So your wife is banging a used car salesman . Sure it 's humiliating . But be a man here
HARRY: You tell on me , I tell on you .
GIB: Whatya talking ? I 'm clean as a preacher 's sheets , babe . Clean as a
HARRY: What about that time you trashed a six-week operation because you were busy getting a blow-job ?
GIB: You know about that ?
MORTON: Two here . Subject is southbound
SIMON: Now do n't be alarmed but if I 'm spotter , it would be best if they do n't see you . You should keep your head down until we 're out of the city .
HARRY: Roger , two . One to Condor , do you have visual ?
SIMON: My place in the city is too hot right now . So is the penthouse in New York . But this place is secure . He takes her inside .
HELEN: What is it you need me to do ?
SIMON: Helen , I want you to be my wife .
HELEN: I 'm married !
SIMON: Just for the operation in Paris . I need to be married . They 'll be looking for a man traveling alone .
HELEN: We 're going to Paris ?
SIMON: Helen , there 's a double agent in my outfit I do n't know who . There 's no one I can trust . Except you . Can you get away ? Just for two days .
HELEN: I do n't know . I have to think
SIMON: Here . Sit down . Be comfortable .
HELEN: Okay . I 'll do it .
SIMON: You are incredibly brave . I have to remind myself the fear you must be feeling . I 've lived like this for years , so I 'm used to it . Every day when I get up , I think it might be my last . But it makes you appreciate life . And the moment . Because that may e all you have . He moves a little closer . Casting his spell .
HELEN: It 's just that it 's been sixteen years since anyone but Harry did that , I
SIMON: Relax . There , that 's better . Let yourself slip into the role .
HELEN: NO ! Stop ! Get off me RIGHT NOW !
SIMON: If not for me , do it fo democracy .
HARRY: Sit down .
HELEN: Kettleman , Barnes and McGrath . I 'm a legal secretary .
HARRY: How long have you been a membe of his faction ?
HELEN: I do n't know anything about a faction . I just met Simon o whatever his name is a couple of weeks ago . I barely know him .
GIB: That 's not what it looked like when we found you .
HARRY: How did you meet him ?
SIMON: Keep this for me . I ca n't afford to be taken with it . National security is at stake . I 'll contact you if a can . Okay ? Oh
HELEN: I should have gone to the police , I suppose .
GIB: But you did n't . Why not ?
HELEN: I do n't know . I guess I wanted to see what would happen .
HARRY: What did happen ?
HELEN: Three days later , he called me . He told me to meet him at Overlook Park .
SIMON: Thank you . You saved my life . What 's your name ?
HELEN: Helen .
SIMON: You can call me Simon . You 're very brave to do this You opened it .
HELEN: I just glances inside .
SIMON: Then you know .
HARRY: Why did you continue to see him ?
HELEN: He needed my help .
HARRY: Not because you were attracted to him ?
HELEN: No .
HARRY: You were n't attracted to him at all ?
HELEN: Well , maybe a little .
GIB: Is this a common thing for you ? Cheating ?
HELEN: No ! Never !
GIB: So , it was your first time .
HELEN: I was n't cheating !
HARRY: Tell me about your husband , Mrs Tasker .
HELEN: Harry ? What can I say about Harry ? He 's a sales rep for a computer company .
HARRY: Would you say he was boring , then ?
HELEN: Yeah . I suppose he is .
GIB: So sex with him is n't exactly making your flag wave anymore .
HELEN: That 's none of your goddamn usiness ! What kind of questions are these ?
HARRY: You 're in a lot of trouble , Mrs. Tasker , so I suggest you cooperate . If we want to know the most intimate details of you life , you 'd better tell us .
HELEN: My husband is a good man .
GIB: But he 's not exactly ringing you ell lately , right ? I mean
HARRY: Let me handle this part . Do you mind ? Why did you go to Carlos ' hideout ?
HELEN: He wanted me to go with him on a mission , to pose as him wife .
HARRY: And you agreed ?
HELEN: Yes .
HARRY: Why ? Helen searches herself for the explanation .
HELEN: I do n't know . I guess I needed something
HARRY: What did you need ?
HELEN: I needed to feel alive . I wanted to do something outrageous . And I do n't know it felt good to be needed . To be trusted . To be special .
HARRY: This Simon . Did you sleep with him ?
HELEN: No .
GIB: She 's lying .
HARRY: You did n't have sexual relations with him ?
HELEN: Look , if you ask me everything twice , this is going to take a eally long time . And I have to get home to my family .
GIB: You 're not going anywhere .
HELEN: Let me out of her ! Right now !
HARRY: Answer the question
HELEN: I did n't sleep with him ! You hear me , you chickenshit astards WHAM ! She hits the mirror again .
GIB: She could be telling the truth .
HARRY: Wait ! Calm down , Mrs. Tasker . There is only one more question .
HELEN: What ?
HARRY: Do you still love your husband ?
HELEN: Yes .
HARRY: Louder please .
HELEN: I love him . I have always loved him and I will always love him . Can I go home , please ?
GIB: Now what ?
HARRY: There is only one solution to your problem , Mrs. Tasker . You must work for us .
GIB: Oh shit . Harry what 're you doing ?
HARRY: I 'm giving her an assignment . I am offerring you a choice . If you work for us we will drop the charges and you can go back to your normal life . If not , you will go to federal prison , and your husband and daughter will be left humiliated and alone . You like will be destroyed .
HELEN: Oh , gee thanks . Mmmm , let me see
HARRY: Yes or no .
HELEN: What do you think ? Of course yes ! What 's involved ?
HARRY: You will be contacted with the assignment .
HELEN: My husband ca n't know about this .
HARRY: No one must know ! Especially him . You must appear to live your life normally , conveying nothing . The security of this nation depends on it . Can you do that ?
HELEN: I think so .
HARRY: Think carefully . You will be lying to the man you love . The person who trusts you the most .
HELEN: I can do it !
HARRY: The code name of your contact will be Boris . Your code name will be
HELEN: Natasha ?
HARRY: No . Doris .
SIMON: Yeeaoowww ! !
HARRY: You son of a bitch . Did you eally think you could elude us forever , Carlos ?
SIMON: Wait ! You got the wrong guy . My name 's Simon . Look , just let me go . There 's no need to kill me . I have n't seen your Harry whips off his ski-mask .
GIB: You can drop it now , Carlos . The game is over . Your career as an inter-national terrorist is too well documented .
SIMON: No I sell cars . That 's all ! Not even foreign cars . Nothing international , I swear . I 'm no terrorist . Everything I said was a lie you have to believe me . I 'm actually a complete coward . If I ever even saw a gun I 'd
HARRY: Beat it .
SIMON: No . Soon as I turn you 'll shoot me .
GIB: Take off , dipshit !
HARRY: We should pick up visual at the next light .
TRILBY: Harry , this report on last night 's operation is the thinnest piece of crap I 've ever seen from you . I 'm sure you wo n't mind giving me a little more detail on why all these assets were deployed .
HARRY: Absolutely . But can it wait ? I 'm on a critical surveillance ight now .
TRILBY: Harry . Is there anything you want to tell me ?
HARRY: No . Not that I can think of .
TRILBY: Harry ? You know we never fire anybody . Click . Harry hangs up the phone slowly .
GIB: We 're dead , right ? So where 'd you put the transmitter ?
HARRY: In her Walkman . It 's the one thing I knew she 'd be taking .
FIGURE: You ! Come with me .
DANA: Oh my Gooooood .
HARRY: There are going to be some changes Dana . You 're going to start following some rules . And I 'm going to be there to see that you do .
DANA: Yeah , right .
HARRY: You 're going to stay in school . Do you understand ?
DANA: Why ? So I can wind up like you ? What 's the point ?
HARRY: Did I tell you about the time we first met ? She looks up at him , puzzled ?
DANA: Dad , how come you know the words ?
HARRY: Honey that song came out in 1968 , when I was exactly your age .
DANA: Unbelievable ! Trent told me he wrote it . He 's history .
HELEN: Where are you off to young lady ?
DANA: I have a book report . Helen watches her go . That 's strange .
HARRY: So last night was pretty exciting , huh ?
HELEN: What ? Oh , the flat tire ? Yeah , I thought the damn towtruck was never going to get there .
METALLIC VOICE: Doris ?
HELEN: Oh . Yes ?
GIB: Listen carefully . Go to the Hotel Marquis in one hour . Pick up an envelope marked Doris at the front desk . And dress sexy .
HELEN: What ?
VOICE: Get going !
HELEN: Uh well , okay then . You sound terrible . I 'll run out right now . Just call the prescription in to the pharmacy . Sure , no problem . Bye .
HARRY: Sure , hon .
GIB: You 've reached a new low with this one . I ca n't believe you 're crazy enough to use the room at the Marquis .
HARRY: Why not ? You think I can afford a suite like that on my salary ?
GIB: Not quite .
HELEN: Do you have an envelope fo Doris ?
METALLIC VOICE: Listen . You are a prostitute named Michelle . Go to the room . A man will be there . He is a suspected arms dealer .
HELEN: Do I have to you know ?
VOICE: No . He has particular tastes . He likes to watch . You will say his regular girl , Carla , is sick . If he likes you , he will tell you what to do . You must plant the ug near the telephone , by the ed , before you leave . If you do not accomplish your mission , the deal is off .
MAN: Step into the light .
HELEN: I 'm Michelle . Carla 's sick . She thought you might like me , so
HARRY: Let the hooker go . She 's not important .
HELEN: Harry , be quiet . Let me handle this .
LEAD TERRORIST: Shutup , both of you .
HELEN: Listen , you do n't need him , he 's nothing . He 's a sales rep for a computer company , really
HARRY: You would n't believe me .
TERRORIST LEADER: Talk again , I kill you .
JUNO: Hello , Harry .
HARRY: Juno . I wish I could say it 's a pleasure to see you again .
HELEN: You know her ?
JUNO: Who 's your little friend ?
HELEN: I 'm Helen Tasker . Harry 's my husband . And you are ?
JUNO: So now it 's Tasker ? Not Renquist ?
HELEN: Look , Harry 's not part of this . He 's just a sales rep .
JUNO: No , my dear , he is a federal agent . He killed two of my colleagues the other night .
HELEN: No , you do n't understand , we 've een married for 15 years
HARRY: Look , Juno , this is just some whacko hooker I met in the bar .
HELEN: Harry , what 's the matter with you ? Tell them the truth . We 're married , we have a daughter
HARRY: I do n't know what this crazy itch is on . You should just cut her loose , so we can get down to usiness .
HELEN: Oh yeah ? Oh yeah ? Then where did I get this ?
JUNO: Something before take-off ?
HELEN: Oooowww ! ! That hurt . You biii She slumps . Juno looks at Harry .
JUNO: She was telling the truth , was n't she Harry ? She really does n't know . Interesting .
MALIK: Who is this woman ?
JUNO: His wife .
MALIK: His wife ? Good . Bring them .
JUNO: Incredible , are n't they ? Warrio figures from the Persian Empire of Darius the First , around 500 BC . I call them `` The Fou Horsemen '' .
MALIK: Open it .
HARRY: Can you give me a clue ? It could e a water heater for all I know .
MALIK: Do you know why you have been ought here ?
HELEN: N-no .
MALIK: So that this man can verify to the world that Crimson Jihad is now a nuclear power .
HELEN: How can Harry do that ? He 's a salesman for chrissakes .
MALIK: If we were wrong about him then the last thing you see will e your blood spraying in his face . Harry steps forward , his face grim .
HARRY: This is a Soviet MIRV-Six , from an SS-22N launch vehicle . The warhead contains 14.5 kilos of enriched uranium , with a plutonium trigger . The nominal yield is 10 kilotons .
HELEN: You bastard ! ! You lying son of a bitch ! !
HARRY: I 'm sorry , honey .
HELEN: Do n't call me honey ! You do n't ever get to call me honey again . You understand ? ! You pig !
JUNO: Here you go , dear .
HELEN: You bugged me ? ! ! Juno cracks up at this .
FAISIL: We 've lost the signal .
GIB: Son of a bitch ! Where ?
PILOT: Miami TCA , we are on final .
GIB: Call our DEA contact , tell him I want those choppers flight-ready the second we land .
HARRY: and I can verify that they
CAMERAMAN: Battery , Abu .
MALIK: Get another one , you moron !
JUNO: This is Samir . See if you can guess his specialty .
HARRY: Oral hygiene ?
JUNO: Not exactly .
HELEN: What 's going on , Harry ?
JUNO: Samir is just going to ask Harry a few questions . See , we 're not even sure which agency Harry works for . Now , Samir is absolutely first class , but on the other hand we have Harry , here , who has managed to lie convincingly to the woman he loves for 15 years . So it will e interesting to see how long he can resist .
SAMIR: This will help .
HARRY: You know , you should swab that with alcohol . I might get an infection .
JUNO: Because they 're very well-funded aving psychotics , and I 'm getting a lot of money .
HARRY: You 're damaged goods , lady .
JUNO: Did you tell her about us , Harry ?
HARRY: There is no us , you psychotic itch .
JUNO: Sure . Say that now .
HELEN: Something you obviously have a hard time doing !
JUNO: Hold that thought . Juno leaves . Harry looks dopily at Helen .
HARRY: There was nothing . I swear .
HELEN: What did he give you ?
HARRY: Sodium amytal , maybe some othe truth agent .
HELEN: It makes you tell the truth ?
HARRY: Yes .
HELEN: Is it working yet ?
HARRY: Ask me a question I would normally lie to .
HELEN: Are we going to die ?
HELEN: I 'd say it 's working .
HARRY: They 'll either torture us to death , shoot us in the head , o leave us until the bomb goes off .
HARRY: 17 years .
HELEN: My God . Have you had to have sex with other women in the line of duty ?
HARRY: I do n't take those assignments .
HELEN: What about Juno ?
HARRY: She 's really a fox , is n't she ?
HELEN: Did you pork her Harry ?
HARRY: No . But I wanted to .
HELEN: Are you a total lying , scumsucking pig Harry ?
HARRY: Looks that way .
SAMIR: Is there anything you would like to tell me before we start ?
HARRY: Yes . I 'm going to kill you pretty soon .
SAMIR: I see . How exactly ?
HARRY: Because I picked the lock on these handcuffs
HELEN: What is it ?
HARRY: God , you have great legs .
HELEN: Harry snap out of it !
HARRY: Go it , baby .
HELEN: Tell me something before this stuff wears off and you start lying again .
HARRY: What ?
HELEN: Do you still love me ?
HARRY: Yes .
HELEN: As much as you used to ?
HARRY: No . Much more .
HARRY: They found the bodies . Come on
HARRY: Let 's go .
HELEN: If we 're on an island , why are they using trucks ?
HARRY: Just us .
HELEN: What are you going to do ?
HARRY: Go down there and kill everybody , I guess .
HELEN: Oh shit .
HARRY: Wait here . If you have to use this , use it . Do n't choke . Okay ?
HELEN: Oh my God . Harry .

HELEN: Fuck you .
GIB: well get the Highway Patrol to go through the streets and tell everybody on their damn loudspeakers . Just the basics get away from windows , do n't look at it yeah
HARRY: Here they come . Gib looks out the window in time to see

GIB: They must have grabbed her during the night we did n't know . Sorry , Harry , I
HARRY: I need to borrow this thing fo a few minutes .
HARRY: If I break it they can take it out of my pay .
GIB: It 'll be fine . He 's got hundreds of hours in Harriers . Joint-ops , cross-training and all that .
AGENT: Harry can fly anything .
GIB: He 's a little rusty . It 's like iding a bicycle . . . you never forget . Uh . . . I 'd seek shelter !
HARRY: Sorry .
DANA: I have to go to the bathroom .
CAMERAMAN: Tape is rolling .
MALIK: This is a communique from Crimson Jihad . You have heard from you own expert . You have seen the Holy fire with your own eyes . Do not force us to destroy this city . And do not try to use force against us . I can trigge this bomb instantly . All I have to do is turn that key and five million of you people will die . The reporter glances down , nervously .
REPORTER: What key ?
MALIK: That key right there ! Malik looks down . The key is gone .
DANA: You shoot me , this 'll fall .
MALIK: If you drop it , I will have no eason not to kill you .

Could happen todayA sunbather , minding his own business , gets stabbed in the heart by the tip of a runaway beach umbrellaNo way you can guard against that kinda thing , no way at all
LAWRENCE: Hey , Burbank , I got a bridge-buyer in Stapleton I need you to cloes by four . Truman turns pale .

LAWRENCE: A half hour across the bay . Sea air . Do you good .
TRUMAN: No , I I got an appointment uptown .

TRUMAN: Do they hurt ?
MERYL: I was afraid I 'd seize up during cross . One of the keys kept sticking .
TRUMAN: Is he gon na take the stand ?
MERYL: No point . Two eye witnesses saw him near the dumpster where they found the legs . She flexes her arthritic wrists .
TRUMAN: I 'll get something out .
MERYL: Did something happen today ?
TRUMAN: What could happen ?
MARLON: Ouch . Whose nuts were those ?
TRUMAN: Mine .
MARLON: Yeah ? Outta what ?
TRUMAN: Outta my job , outta Queensout ! < /i Marlon takes a practise swing .
MARLON: Outta your job ? What the hell 's wrong with your job ? You got ta great job .
TRUMAN: It does n't mean anything .
TRUMAN: I got ta get out .
MARLON: Sure and go where ?
TRUMAN: i > Australia. < /i
MARLON: No shit . Where is Australia exactly ? Near England ?
TRUMAN: See here , this is Queens . All the way round here , Australia . You ca n't get any further away before you start coming back . Y'know , there 're still places in Australia where no human being has ever set foot .
MARLON: So when are you leaving ?
TRUMAN: It 's not that simple . Takes money , planning . You ca n't just up and go . Oh , I 'm gon na do it , do n't worry about that . I just got ta move slow . Pick a moment . Bonus time 's just around the corner . Soon as I get a retaining wall uilt on the back of the house I can start thinking about selling upand I 'll be gone . Up and away on that big steel bird . I 'm going , do n't you worry about that .
MARLON: I never knew anybody who got out .
TRUMAN: Tick-fucking-tock . That 's the fucking problem , Marlon . I 'm thirty-four . I 'm older than Jesus Christ .
MARLON: You win .
MARLON: They 're still there . Just buried under what we settled for .
TRUMAN: You really think it could 've dropped off an airliner ?
MARLON: Sure . It 's halogen . You oughta report it . You coming for a drink ?
TRUMAN: I ca n't tonight .
MERYL: What are you doing ? Come to bed .
TRUMAN: I figure we could scrape together eight thousand .
MERYL: Oh . God , everytime you and Marlon
TRUMAN: We could bum around the world for a yea on that .
MERYL: And then what , Truman ? We 'd be back to where we were five years ago . You 're talking like a teenager .
TRUMAN: Maybe I feel like a teenager .
MERYL: We said we 'd try for a baby . Is n't that enough of an adventure ?
TRUMAN: That can wait . I want to get away . See some of the world . Explore . Meryl gives a derisive laugh .
MERYL: You want to be an explorer ? You mean like all the other great explorers from Queens ? You do n't even have a passport , Truman . I et you do n't even know how to get one . The words sting . Truman turns away .
GUARD 1: How can they have a child ?
GUARD 2: It 's not gon na be his , you idiot .
GUARD 1: Why not ?
GUARD 2: You think she 'd go through with it ? Guess I always thought they 'd adopt .
TRUMAN: Daddy ! ! Daddy ! ! His cries go unanswered .
ATTENDANT: Hey !
TRUMAN: Two , four , oh , six .
ATTENDANT: What the fuck are you trying to pull ? !
TRUMAN: I 'm sorry ! I 'm sorry ! No harm done ! No harm done !
ATTENDANT: I oughta fuck you up !
MARLON: What 're you doing ? The man told you there 's no such bus .
TRUMAN: He 's lying . Two , four , oh , six was definitely the number .
MARLON: C'mon , Truman , a lotta times they do n't find a body . You know what the currents are like in that water .
TRUMAN: You had to see his face when that wave hit . He was n't scared Marion . It was like he was expecting it , waiting for it . He knew it was coming .
MARLON: Why would he fake it ? He 's not Elvis Presley .
TRUMAN: You know what was really strange about today ? An old woman with a little dog and a usinessman , walking in opposite directions on the sidewalk , both react like clockwork . They force him onto a bus against his will , a bus that does n't normally stop outside my building . And when I 'm giving chase , the us never makes another stop and I get the feeling that the traffic and the pedestrians are working together to make sure I neve catch up with it .
MARLON: Oh , so now it 's also the pedestrians and the buses and the cars ? What are you saying , the entire population of Lowe Manhattan is conspiring to stop you finding out that your father staged his death to pursue a life as a street person ? Oh yeah , that makes sense .
TRUMAN: You think I imagined it , do n't you ?
MARLON: I think you 're missing your dad . The anniversary was yesterday , was n't it ?
TRUMAN: Maybe you 're right . If only the old woman had n't left her dog behind .
RAQUEL: Do n't you dare go in . Truman . I just got her off to sleep .
TRUMAN: It was Dad . I swear .
RAQUEL: Well , the next time he shows up . bring him over . Until then , I 'm not saying a word about this to Mom and neither are you .
TRUMAN: If it was n't him , it was his twin . Can you think of a reason he 'd want to hide from us ?
TRUMAN: I was seven years old !
TRUMAN: I 'm telling you he 's alive !
RAQUEL: And I 'm telling you he 's fish food !
CHRISTOF: You did well .
CHLOE: We 've tightened security .

LAUREN: No .
TRUMAN: Friday ?
LAUREN: Now. < /i
TRUMAN: Right now ? We got finals .
LAUREN: If we do n't go now , it wo n't happen . Truman hesitates .
TRUMAN: II ca n't . Lauren suddenly stops splashing .
LAUREN: That 's right . Oh , God , I 'm sorry .
TRUMAN: Why ? You 've got nothing to be sorry about . Has someone been talking to you ? Lauren wrings out her dress .
LAUREN: Get me out of here . I do n't want to e here . Lauren starts walking away .
TRUMAN: What are you talking about ? Lauren ! Lauren !
LAUREN: My name 's not Lauren ! It 's Sylvia ! < /i Truman looks into her eyes and believes her .
SYLVIA: In a minute someone 's going to come and stop me talking to you .
TRUMAN: Who ? There 's no one around .
SYLVIA: You remember when you were a little boy , you stood up in class and said you wanted to be an explorer like Magellan . And you teacher , Sister Olivia said , `` You 're too late , Truman . There 's nothing left to explore . '' And all the other kids laughed . And you sat down .
TRUMAN: How do you know about that ?
SYLVIA: It does n't matter . You 've forgotten about that boy , Truman . You got scared . Just ecause something happens , does n't mean you ca n't take another chance in your life .
TRUMAN: I do n't understand .
SYLVIA: There is n't much time . Just listen . Everybody 's pretending Truman . Everybody ut you. < /i Look at that project . You think anybody lives there ? It 's all for you , Truman . A show . The eyes are everywhere .
TRUMAN: Eyes ? Where ?
TRUMAN: Hey !
MAN: Get in the car , Lauren ! Truman jumps up .
TRUMAN: Who are you ? ! < /i

SYLVIA: No he 's not ! He 's just saying that ! Does he look anything like me ? !
TRUMAN: Shut your mouth !
MAN: I told you not to come here anymore ! Which one are you ?
SYLVIA: Do n't listen to him , Truman . Make yourself deaf . Come find me .
MAN: Do n't bother ! We 're moving to Australia . New York 's done something to her head .
VERONICA: You want me to do it again ? I think I could do it better .
TRUMAN: Nothank you .
VERONICA: For sure ? The nuns at my school , they used to say , `` The whole of life is faith . ''
TRUMAN: I 've got something to tell you , Sis .
RAQUEL: I 've got something to tell you too .
TRUMAN: I 'm going to Australia .
RAQUEL: Mom 's real sick .
WAITRESS: She was willing to lose him if it meant he could find himself . Never mind .
TRUMAN: I have an appointment at , erDiamond Enterprises .

TRUMAN: I 've fallen over something , Marlon . Something to do with my Dad . I think .
MARLON: Are you okay ? You look like shit .
TRUMAN: It 's big , Marlon . You would n't believe who 's in on it .
MARLON: In on what ? < /i
MARLON: Something 's definitely in the air . My last delivery , a kid got crushed to death . tilting a vending machine . They wo n't even let me take the rest of the day off .
TRUMAN: Do it , anyway .
MARLON: i > Who ? < /i
TRUMAN: I do n't know . They look just like regula people . But I 've been writing down numbers - license plates , taxi numbers , ID numbers - the same ones keep cropping up over and over .

MARLON: Christ , Truman . You 're gon na get both ou asses fired .
TRUMAN: The beach .

MARLON: What 're we doing here , Truman ?
TRUMAN: This is where it started .
MARLON: Where what started ?
MARLON: I do n't want to put you down but why would anybody go to all this trouble over you ?
TRUMAN: Maybe I 've been mistaken for somebody else .
MARLON: A coincidence . Have n't you ever heard of a coincidence ?
TRUMAN: I 'm scared , Marlon . I 'm as scared as hell . But I 've never felt more alive . It 's just like she said .

PROD. MANAGER: Happy ?

PROD. MANAGER: I think so .
CHLOE: Why go to all the trouble ?
CHRISTOF: He believes she has the answer .
CHLOE: Why not just tell him she 's dead ?
CHRISTOF: It 's too late for that . That wo n't satisfy

INSURANCE AGENT: I always write `` Yours faithfully '' < /i
LAWRENCE: Where the hell have you been , Burbank ? What the hell 's going on ?

MERYL: So why do you wan na go ?
TRUMAN: Cos I never have . That 's why you go places , is n't it ? Cos you 're curious . I have n't een curious since I was seven years old , y'know that ? Back then you 'd have to nail me to the floor to keep me in one place .

MARLON: It 's a lot of world for one man . You sure that 's not wishful thinking , you wishing
MARLON: I used to dream all my friends and family got together in a hotel room , thinking of ways to fuck me up .

CHRISTOF: Thank you .
CHLOE: He was premature , was n't he ?
CHRISTOF: Only by two weeks .
CHLOE: Curious even then ? Like he could n't wait to get started ?
CHRISTOF: His eagerness to leave his mother 's wom also meant he was the one selected .
CHLOE: What was it like , the first show ?
CHRISTOF: The ultimate live television . In competition with five other unwanted pregnancies - the casting of a show determined by an air date - he was the one who arrived on cue .
CHRISTOF: It wo n't come to that .
CHLOE: The rotation was made this morning .
CHRISTOF: I do n't like the couple with the baby . They 'd never be together .

WOMAN: Give him a break . It 's taken him thirty- four years to get the nerve to go in there .
SIMEON: Ready two . Go to two .
SIMEON: That loser pays our salary .
OPERATOR: He 's given up on himself again .
SIMEON: Who cares ? Makes life easier for us . He is what he is .
CHRISTOF: When did he start sleeping like that ?
SIMEON: About the time Meryl left .
CHRISTOF: Is that the best shot we can get ?
SIMEON: What 's to see ?
CHRISTOF: What happened to the room ?
SIMEON: He started to reorganize . I was going to call you . But half-way through , he gave up and fell asleep .

CHRISTOF: Any fucking pretext !
MARLON: Tru ! ..Tru ! ..

CHLOE: How does he know where the cameras are ?
CHRI STOF: I do n't know . All I know is we 've been filming a blow-up doll for the last three hours . Simeon feels the hostility .
SIMEON: We 've declared a curfew . Only the extras equired for the search are on the set . Everyone else is at first positions .
CHRISTOF: All prop cars accounted for ?
SIMEON: He has to be on foot . He has the world 's most recognizable face . He ca n't disappear .
CHLOE: The sponsors are threatening to pull the plug if we do n't make a statement within the next

TRUMAN: Not yet .
POLICE OFFICER: Take it easy .
MOSES: Rumors are circulating he 's dead .
CHRISTOF: Why ? We 're getting higher ratings fo that graphic than any time in the series .
CHLOE: When we flush him out how do we explain this ?
CHRISTOF: We tell him the truth . Chloe looks askance at Christof .
SIMEON: We 'll get him on this next sweep .
CHRISTOF: What have we missed ?
SIMEON: It 's just a matter of time .
CHRISTOF: No . We 've missed something .
SYLVIA: You remember when you were a little boy
CHRISTOF: Trust that boy We 're not watching the sea .
SIMEON: Why would we ?
CHRISTOF: Sweep the harbor .
SIMEON: That 's him !
CHRISTOF: Resume transmission .
CHOPPER PILOT: Alter course immediately . You are entering a restricted area . Truman screams defiantly back to the chopper .
TRUMAN: Fuck you !
CHRISTOF: Fire a warning .
SIMEON: Jesus ! God ! Is he out of his mind ?
CHRISTOF: Pull back .
CHRISTOF: We have to stop him for his own good . Turn him back with the elements .
SIMEON: There 's no rescue boat in the area . He wo n't know what to do .
MOSES: For God 's sake , Chris . The whole world is watching . We ca n't kill him in front of a live audience .
TRUMAN: I 'm coming to find you Sylvia ! I 'm making myself deaf ! You 're going to have to kill me ! Come on !
SIMEON: It 's not working . He can sail that thing !
ROMAN: How can he sail ? ! He 's in insurance ! He has n't set foot on a boat since he was seven !
MOSES: On the behalf of the studio , I demand you cease transmission .
CHRISTOF: Keep running ! I take full responsibility . How close ?
OPERATOR: Very close .
CHRISTOF: Capsize him ! Tip him over !
CHLOE: You ca n't ! He 's tied himself to the wheel . He 'll drown !
SIMEON: He does n't care
CHLOE: You lied , you hypocrite ! The only way he can leave , is dead !
CHRISTOF: Do it !
SIMEON: It 's too late
OPERATOR: Yeah !
GUIDE: the soundstage roof houses over eight
TRUMAN: Nobody move ! Drive !
TRUMAN: Act normal ! Keep filming !
CHILD: Please , Mister Truman .

ROSALIE: Too late .
EDWARD: I 'll run Bella south , while you lead the tracker away
DR. CULLEN: No , Edward the tracker thinks you wo n't leave Bella . He 'll follow you .
ALICE: I 'll go with Bella . Jasper and
EDWARD: Can you keep your thoughts to yourself ?
BELLA: If any of you get hurt because of me
EDWARD: We wo n't , there are five of us , two of them . When it 's done , I 'll come get you .
ALICE: You should eat .
BELLA: They could get hurt . It 's not worth it .
JASPER: Yes . It is .
ALICE: The tracker . He just changed course..
JASPER: Where will it take him , Alice ?
ALICE: Mirrors . It 's a room of mirrors .
BELLA: How do the visions work ? Edward said they were n't always certain .
JASPER: She sees the course people are on , while they 're on it . If they change their minds , the visions change .
BELLA: So the course James is on now will lead him to a ballet studio ?
ALICE: You 've been here ?
BELLA: No . I do n't know . I used to take allet lessons as a kid . The school had an arch like that .
JASPER: Was your school here in Phoenix ?
BELLA: Yeah , around the corner from my house . But I have n't been there in ten years .
JASPER: Do you have any reason to go now ?
BELLA: No . Hell , no . I hated the place .
EDWARD: I 'm coming to get you . ( hates having to say
EDWARD: Bella , we 're in too deep . We ca n't change how we feel..
BELLA: No we ca n't . When will you get here ?
EDWARD: In a couple hours . Then you and
BELLA: Mom , I 'm so glad you got my -
JAMES: I was prepared to wait for you . But then Mom came home after she eceived a very worried call from your Dad . It all worked out quite well .
BELLA: Leave my mother out of this .
JAMES: You 're protective of her . That 's nice . You can still save her . But you 'll need to get away from you friends . Can you do that ?
BELLA: I do n't think so .
JAMES: If your mother 's life depends on it ?
BELLA: Where should I meet you ?
JAMES: The old ballet studio around the corner . And I 'll know if you bring anyone along . Poor mommy would pay the price for that mistake .
BELLA: 8th and Palo Verde , please .
BELLA: Everyone makes fun of me .
RENE: But you 're a wonderful dancer .
BELLA: Mom , I suck .
JAMES: That 's my favorite part . Stubborn child , were n't you ?
BELLA: She 's not here .
JAMES: Sorry . But you really made it too easy .
BELLA: Edward has nothing to do with this .
JAMES: He will . His rage will make fo more interesting sport than his feeble attempt to protect you .
BELLA: No ! Edward , don't..
JAMES: Cut ! The end .
EDWARD: I 'm strong enough to kill you .
DR. CULLEN: Her femoral artery 's been severed . She 's losing too much blood
BELLA: It 's on fire ! My hand !
EDWARD: Venom -
EDWARD: No !
ALICE: It 's going to happen . I 've seen it
EDWARD: It does n't have to be that way .
DR. CULLEN: Alice , find me a tourniquet .
BELLA: It 's burning !
EDWARD: What 's the other choice ? You said
DR. CULLEN: Tighter , above the knee
DR. CULLEN: You can try to suck the venom out .
EDWARD: I wo n't be able to stop
DR. CULLEN: Find the will to stop . But choose , she only has minutes left .
EDWARD: It 's alright , Bella . I 'll make it go away .
DR. CULLEN: Stop . Her blood is clean , you 're killing her .
BELLA: Life is harder..
RENE: He 's asleep .
BELLA: What happened ?
RENE: Baby , you fell down two flights of stairs and through a window .
BELLA: Sounds like me .
RENE: It 's Phil . He 's worried about you .
BELLA: Mom , you 're texting .
BELLA: That 's great mom .
RENE: Jacksonville is always sunny and you 'll have your own bathroom..
BELLA: Mom , wait . I want to live in Forks . I have Dad..
RENE: And he 's there .
BELLA: What do you think ?
BELLA: Um , Mom , would you mind getting Dad ?
RENE: I 'm sure he does n't care about that , Baby . But I ‘ ll go get him .
BELLA: Is James - did you
EDWARD: We took care of him . And the woman , Victoria , she ran off .
BELLA: I 'm alive because of you .
EDWARD: You 're in here because of me .
BELLA: But you did .
EDWARD: Bella , you should go to Jacksonville . Where I ca n't hurt you anymore..
BELLA: What ? No ! I want to be with you !
CHARLIE: Heard that before .
CHARLIE: and you look beautiful .
EDWARD: Prom is an important rite of passage . I do n't want you to miss anything .
BELLA: You 're serious .
EDWARD: See ? You 're dancing .
BELLA: At prom .
BELLA: I want you . Always .
EDWARD: I wo n't end your life for you .
BELLA: I 'm dying anyway . Every minute , I get closer , olde
EDWARD: That 's how it 's supposed to happen .
BELLA: Not the way Alice saw it . I heard her . She saw me like you .
EDWARD: Her visions change , Bella .
BELLA: Based on what someone decides . And I 've decided .
EDWARD: Is that what you dream about ? Becoming a monster ?
BELLA: I dream about being with you forever .
EDWARD: You really want this ?
BELLA: Yes .
EDWARD: You 're ready right now ?
BELLA: Yes .
EDWARD: You 're going to have a long and happy life with me . Is n't that enough ?
BELLA: For now .
BELLA: Edward !
EDWARD: Happy birthday .
CHARLIE: Happy birthday , Bells .
BELLA: Dad , we agreed , no gifts .
CHARLIE: At least mine 's not wrapped .
BELLA: Okay , this is actually kind of great . Thanks , Dad .
CHARLIE: Goes with this one from your mom . We coordinated - well , she coordinated me .
BELLA: Not that old .
CHARLIE: I do n't know . Is that a wrinkle ? Bella races to the mirror , searches her face .
BELLA: So not funny , Dad .
MIKE: You finish the Shakespeare assignment ?
JESSICA: He means will you finish his assignment ?
MIKE: No , I do n't okay I do .
BELLA: I can help you with it but first I need a picture . My mom 's expecting a scrapbook full of memories .
ANGELA: I take ` em , I do n't pose for ` em .
BELLA: You do today .
JESSICA: You 'll photoshop my nose if it looks ig , right ?
ERIC: Do n't worry , I 'm in the picture ; no one will be looking at you guys .
MIKE: Oh good . Cullen 's here .
JESSICA: Yay . The friends , uncomfortable , move off
ERIC: Check ya later .
EDWARD: Happy birthday . except that one . Her face falls .
BELLA: Do n't remind me .
EDWARD: Your birth is definitely a day to celebrate .
BELLA: Not for me .
EDWARD: Eighteen is a little early to be worrying about your age .
BELLA: It 's one year older than you .
EDWARD: Bella , I 'm ninety .
BELLA: True . Maybe I should be creeped out that I 'm dating such an old guy .
EDWARD: Yes , it 's the age that 's creepy , not the fact that you 're dating a vampire .
BELLA: Right . Class .
EDWARD: Someone wants you .
BELLA: God , Jacob , what are they feeding you on that rez , steroids ? You 're huge .
JACOB: Would n't seem so drastic if you came around more .
BELLA: I will , soon . But is n't your school , like , ten miles that way ?
JACOB: Just here buying this for the Rabbit . I 'm almost done with the rebuild . Got ta come take a ride when it 's done . Oh , and hey , happy birthday . Your dad told my dad . So
BELLA: This , I need . It 's great .
EDWARD: The bell 's about to ring .
JACOB: Ooh , look at you , all psychic .
EDWARD: I do n't have that particular gift . But I can read a watch . I 'm cleve that way .
BELLA: Bye , Jake , and thank you . Edward guides her away . As they walk off
EDWARD: How come Jacob Black gets to give you a gift and I do n't ?
BELLA: He 's just a friend .
EDWARD: `` Friends '' do n't spend two weeks looking for the perfect dreamcatcher .
BELLA: Stop reading his mind if he bothers you so much .
EDWARD: Little hard to tune out .
ALICE: Happy
BELLA: Shh !
ALICE: birthday .
BELLA: Alice , did n't I say no gifts ?
ALICE: You did . I did n't . I 've already seen you open it and guess what ? You love it .
BELLA: You had a vision about my birthday .
ALICE: And about the green dress you 'll be wearing to your party tonight . Great color on you .
BELLA: My party ?
ALICE: Please ? It 'll be fun .
BELLA: I guess I can deal
ALICE: Great ! See ya at seven !
BELLA: Wait , Jasper , no fair with the mood control .
EDWARD: Vampires . You ca n't trust them .
ROMEO: Arms , take your last embrace , and lips , O you , the doors of breath , seal with a righteous kiss
BELLA: I hate being celebrated .
EDWARD: Come on , the last real birthday any of us had was Emmett 's - I think Bing Crosby was on top of the charts . You 'll be helping us feel normal for a night .
BELLA: Juliet 's alright if you like that obviously beautiful sort of thing .
EDWARD: Not the girl - the suicide . Nearly impossible for my kind . But humans , a little poison , dagger to the heart . There are so many options .
BELLA: Why would you even think about that ?
EDWARD: I considered it . Once . When James had you trapped .
BELLA: It would n't have been your fault
EDWARD: Either way , I had a plan .
BELLA: What plan ?
EDWARD: There are ways for us . At least one way . I would have gone to Italy , provoked the Volturi
BELLA: The who ?
MR. BERTY: Is there something you 'd like to share with the class , Edward ?
EDWARD: Certainly not . But I apologize fo eing a distraction . Perhaps you should rewind to act five , scene one , line twenty-eight eighty-nine `` If you had the strength of twenty men it would dispatch you straight . ''
MR. BERTY: Eyes on the screen , people . Bella is too concerned to be amused .
EDWARD: Francesco Solimena painted this ; he often depicted the Volturi as Gods . Bella examines the golden haired `` God . ''
BELLA: Is that Carlisle ?
EDWARD: Yes . He lived with them for a few decades . He describes them as very efined - for killers .
BELLA: Do n't even talk about that . You ca n't let anyone hurt you . The Volturi or anyone else .
EDWARD: Who else would hurt me ?
BELLA: You said there were more dangerous things out there than you . And I know you have at least one enemy
EDWARD: Victoria ? Yes , some day . But Alice will see her coming . And she wo n't win . Bella looks up at him , pained .
BELLA: I hate that I ca n't protect you . He laughs , amused . She 's decidedly not .
EDWARD: I know . But you do protect me From boredom And loneliness You give me a reason to stay un- dead . But it 's my job ; to protect you
ALICE: It 's time it 's time it 's time !
CARLISLE: Sorry about all this . We tried to ein Alice in .
ESME: Like that 's even possible . Happy irthday , Bella .
ALICE: Found it in your bag . Mind ? Emmett moves to Edward 's side . Nudges him .
EMMETT: Dating an older woman . Hot .
ROSALIE: It 's a necklace . Alice picked it out .
ALICE: Show me the love !
BELLA: Alice , I 'm the only one who even eats cake . That thing could feed fifty .
ALICE: Hope you 're hungry . Here , this one 's from Emmett .
BELLA: Um thanks ?
EMMETT: Already installed it in your truck .
EDWARD: Finally , a decent sound system in that piece of
BELLA: No hating on the truck . Thank you , Emmett .
ALICE: Open mine .
BELLA: Ouch - paper cut .
ALICE: Jaz shhh
CARLISLE: Emmett , get Jasper out of here . Emmett .
ALICE: I 'm sorry , I ca n't
CARLISLE: I 'll have to stitch this up .
EDWARD: I 'll carry her to the kitchen .
CARLISLE: I 'll take care of her , Edward . Check on Jasper . Go .
BELLA: I sure can kill a party .
CARLISLE: It 's not your fault . Jasper has n't een away from human blood as long as the rest of us .
BELLA: Seems like you 're the only one it does n't effect .
CARLISLE: Centuries of practice .
BELLA: Did you ever think of living differently ?
CARLISLE: I enjoy my work too much . Helping people , saving lives . I 'm hoping there 's a point to my existence , even if I am damned .
BELLA: Damned ? You 're not damned .
CARLISLE: Then you and I agree . But Edward does n't believe there 's an afterlife for our kind . He thinks we 've lost our souls .
BELLA: That 's why he wo n't He thinks he 'd e damning me .
EDWARD: What do you want me to say ?
BELLA: That I 'm a klutz . That I should have een more careful
EDWARD: You got a paper cut . Normal people get paper cuts . And a normal oyfriend would n't have flung you into a stack of plates . A normal boyfriend would n't have had to fight the urge to kill you
BELLA: Stop . I do n't want normal , I want you .
EDWARD: That 's your solution ? My ending you life ?
BELLA: Your giving me forever .
EDWARD: You should go in . It 's late .
BELLA: I 'll leave my window open for you .
EDWARD: I wo n't be coming back . Not tonight .
BELLA: Then can I ask for one thing ? It 's still my birthday . Kiss me ?
EDWARD: Walk with me ?
BELLA: What ? Why ?
EDWARD: It 's time . Carlisle 's supposed to be ten years older than he looks ; people will start noticing .
BELLA: But when ?
EDWARD: Now .
BELLA: I 'll have to think of something to tell Charlie , but I can be ready
EDWARD: Not you . Us .
BELLA: What ? no Edward , what happened with Jasper - that was nothing .
EDWARD: Nothing compared to what could happen . You do n't belong in my world .
BELLA: I belong with you
EDWARD: You do n't
BELLA: I 'm coming
EDWARD: I do n't want you to come !
BELLA: You do n't want me .
EDWARD: No . She steps back . Trying to understand this .
BELLA: Anything .
EDWARD: Do n't do anything stupid or reckless do you understand ? for Charlie 's sake . Just take care of yourself .
BELLA: I yes I will . He softens ever-so-slightly .
EDWARD: Do n't worry . You 're human . Time heals all wounds for your kind . Particularly if you 're not reminded .
BELLA: No , this is - do n't do this . Please .
EDWARD: Try to understand . Every second with you is about restraint . You 're too fragile . I 'm tired of pretending to e something I 'm not . Reining myself in so I can be with a human .
BELLA: Then take my soul . I do n't care ! I do n't want it without you
EDWARD: You 're not good for me , Bella .
BELLA: Wait
CHARLIE: I 'll call the Cullens again . Her note said she and Edward went for a walk .
BILLY: They left town , Charlie .
HARRY CLEARWATER: Hospital said Doc Cullen got a big jo somewhere else .
JACOB: Charlie ! Charlie spins to where Jacob points
BILLY: It 's Sam Uley . He found her .
CHARLIE: Thank you , Sam . Thank God .
BELLA: He 's gone . Off her as Charlie carries her inside
CARLISLE: No . We promised Edward .
ALICE: But she wo n't do well without us . I get flashes of her , but they 're unclear
ROSALIE: Forget her , let 's drag Edward home .
ESME: He 'll come back when he 's ready . After Bella moves on .
CARLISLE: Yes . When she 's living her life , safe from danger
JASPER: You mean safe from us . Alice wraps an arm around Jasper , soothingly .
ROSALIE: And when will that be ?
EMMETT: Can you see him , Alice ?
ALICE: The only decision he 's made
CHARLIE: It 's about time you got rid of those , Bob . Seen one too many bikers smeared on the highway .
BOB: Save the lecture , Chief . Soon as the garbage truck hauls ` em off , you and my wife can rest easy . Oh , hey , what 's the word on that bea problem ? Folks are saying they 're huge .
CHARLIE: That 's just talk
BOB: How you doin ' there , Bella ?
CHARLIE: That 's it .
BELLA: That 's what ?
CHARLIE: You 're going to Jacksonville to live with your mother .
BELLA: What ? Why ?
CHARLIE: I just - do n't know what to do any more . You do n't act like someone left you ; more like someone died . She looks away . That 's how it feels to her .
BELLA: I 'm not leaving Forks .
CHARLIE: Bells , the bastard 's not coming back . She nods . Knows this all too well .
BELLA: I like my old friends .
CHARLIE: You never even see them anymore .
BELLA: I do , too . In fact , I 'm um Jessica and I are going to Port Angeles tomorrow . Shopping .
CHARLIE: You hate shopping .
BELLA: That 's how good a friend I am .
CHARLIE: Alright . Shopping .
BELLA: Yes , Bella Swan . Hey , any chance you feel like shopping tomorrow ?
JESSICA: It 's , like , a metaphor ? For crass consumerism or something . Bella glances at her .
BELLA: I bought something .
JESSICA: Socks do n't count . ` Course , I was surprised you even called .
BELLA: I 've been kind of out of it .
JESSICA: Kind of ? I mean , at first I was worried . Then I 'm like , okay , she 's still bumming ? It 's not like I was n't going through things , too . Like Mike deciding he wanted to `` just be friends ? '' That was really hard and
BELLA: I know them I think
JESSICA: Can we just go
BELLA: I want to see something .
GUY #1: Alright , we got a taker .
EDWARD: Turn around , Bella . This is dangerous .
BELLA: You 're not them . And with that . Edward disappears .
GUY #1: We 'll be whoever you want , honey .
GUY #2: Ready for a thrill ride ?
BELLA: I can break promises , too .
GUY #2: Okay .
JESSICA: Bella !
BELLA: Wait
GUY #2: Hey , I did n't force nothing on you .
JESSICA: What the hell is wrong with you ? !
BELLA: I saw something .
JESSICA: You . Are insane . Or suicidal .
BELLA: The more dangerous the more real it was .
JESSICA: So , what , you 're like an adrenaline junky now ? Go hang-gliding or bungie- jumping . Do n't be a complete freak .
JACOB: Bella !
BELLA: I brought you something .
JACOB: Scrap metal . You should n't have .
BELLA: I rescued them from the dump . They 'd cost more than they 're worth to fix unless one had a mechanic-type friend .
JACOB: Me , being the mechanic-type friend ? Since when are you into motorcycles ?
BELLA: Recently .
JACOB: The parts alone will be pricey .
BELLA: I have a college fund I can dig into .
JACOB: Charlie 's gon na love that .
BELLA: Charlie wo n't know .
JACOB: Wow . Lying to Dad . Blowing through college money . Repairing dangerous machines - that I 'm guessing you 'll want to ride ?
BELLA: I really get it if you think this is stupid and reckless .
JACOB: Oh it 's totally stupid and reckless . When do we start ?
TIM: We 're going the wrong way .
NATE: Who cares ? Enjoy the scenery .
TIM: And the West Nile virus . Tim hears a RUSTLE . Stops .
NATE: If I knew you were such a wuss , I 'd have brought my grandma .
TIM: Could be one of those giant bears .
NATE: There are no giant
TIM: What the hell is that ? !
NATE: I do n't know !
TIM: Think it 's gone ?
BELLA: If we 're going to be working on this every day , we should probably include some homework . Do n't want the Dads to think I 'm a bad influence on you .
JACOB: You influence me ? Please .
BELLA: I am older than you .
JACOB: Age ai n't nothin ' but a number .
BELLA: And I convinced you to secretly build us two-wheeled death machines .
JACOB: God , you 're right , you 're like Satan
EMBRY: Hey , Jake
JACOB: Hey . This is Bella . Bella , that 's Quil and Embry .
QUIL: So the bike building story is true .
BELLA: Taught him everything he knows .
QUIL: What about the part where you 're his girlfriend ?
BELLA: Oh , we 're just friends .
EMBRY: Ooh . Burn .
JACOB: I said she 's a girl and a friend .
QUIL: Embry , you remember him making that distinction ?
EMBRY: Nope . Bella rescues Jacob
BELLA: So I guess you guys have girlfriends .
JACOB: Right . Quil took his cousin to prom . Embry chuckles , as well .
QUIL: Yeah , that 's still a riot . You want funny , Black ? I 'll give you funny .
EMBRY: I got five bucks on Quil .
BELLA: You 're on .
JACOB: Quil keeps asking to come over . I think he likes you a little too much .
BELLA: Tell him I 'm not into the couga thing .
JACOB: What is it with you and age ? I mean , that Cullen guy was young , did n't seem to bother you .
CHARLIE: You 're alright , Bells . You 're okay .
BELLA: It 's not as bad as it was .
CHARLIE: Yeah right . I know what it 's like , you know . When your mom left me . I had a hell of a time . Imagined doing all kinds of crazy things , just to stop the pain . She avoids his look .
BELLA: He 's been keeping me afloat .
CHARLIE: That 's good . He 's a good guy . Off Bella
JACOB: We got lucky at the dump . You know how much a new crankshaft goes for ?
BELLA: Sure , I spend all my free time on crankshaft-dot-com .
JACOB: I think that 's a porn site . These bikes are gon na be rolling soon . Where should we ride first ?
BELLA: Someplace sunny .
JACOB: Like there 's any place sunny around here .
BELLA: I know a place above the cloud line
JACOB: So we 'll find our sunny spot , right ?
BELLA: Is n't that Sam Uley ?
JACOB: And his cult .
BELLA: Oh my God ! Stop them !
JACOB: They 're not really fighting , Bella . They 're cliff diving .
BELLA: What , on purpose ?
JACOB: Scary as hell , but a total rush .
BELLA: Think I could ?
JACOB: Man , first motorcycles , now cliff diving ?
BELLA: You said it was a rush .
JACOB: Maybe on a warmer day . And not from the top . We 'll leave the showing off to Sam and his disciples .
BELLA: You do n't like them .
JACOB: They think they run this place . Acting all bad ass , calling themselves `` protectors . ''
BELLA: What are they protecting ?
JACOB: The tribe , the land , their right to be jerks . Embry used to call them hall monitors on steroids ; now look at him .
BELLA: That 's Embry ? I did n't recognize him . What happened to him ?
JACOB: He missed some school - then , out of nowhere , he 's following Sam around . Same thing happened with Paul and Jared . They were n't even friends , now Sam owns them . Sam keeps giving me this look , like he 's waiting for me or something ; it 's kinda freaking me out .
BELLA: Maybe you should just avoid them .
JACOB: I try but
BELLA: Hey . If it gets worse , we 'll go to my Dad . Or you can come stay with us .
JACOB: Thanks . If this is how you 're going to react , I 'll freak out more often .
JESSICA: I 'll kill Tyler if he gave me his flu .
ANGELA: It 's going around . My sister was so sick she could n't come on our hike this weekend so she did n't see it .
ERIC: Ang , maybe you should keep that to yourself
ANGELA: We saw something , Eric .
ERIC: I believe you .
JESSICA: No he does n't . He 's just trying to get lucky .
ERIC: Is that an option ?
ANGELA: It was jet black and huge ; on all fours it was still taller than a person . A bear maybe .
JESSICA: Or Big Foot .
MIKE: Or an alien . Lucky you did n't get probed .
ANGELA: We saw it .
BELLA: You 're not the only one . Everyone stares . Did Bella just speak ?
MIKE: I did hear some guy talking about it at the store .
ERIC: Last time you clowns doubt my girlfriend .
JACOB: You look scared .
BELLA: I 'm not .
JACOB: Brake ? Clutch ? Right . Gas ? You ready ?
BELLA: I 'm going again .
JACOB: I 'm not sure that 's a good Bella quickly rises and hops back on .
BELLA: Release it . Slowly .
JACOB: Bank it ! Bank - hit the brake !
BELLA: I want to go again .
JACOB: Forget it . I 'm revoking you motorcycle privileges . Man , look at your head .
BELLA: God , I 'm sorry .
JACOB: You 're apologizing for bleeding ?
BELLA: It does n't bother you ?
JACOB: It 's just blood , Bella .
BELLA: Just , you 're actually good looking .
JACOB: How hard did you hit your head ?
BELLA: Oh I - yeah .
JACOB: Upgraded from good looking ?
BELLA: No , temperature hot . You 're burning up .
JACOB: I feel fine .
BELLA: It just means something else to you than it does to me .
JACOB: One , that 's my problem . But two we have fun , you think I 'm hot
BELLA: Good looking .
JACOB: I know you like me .
BELLA: More than anyone . But that 's all .
JACOB: Because of Cullen ?
BELLA: I already do . You do n't know how much . You 're my best friend but I do n't think my feelings will change .
JACOB: No . That 's not I just feel weird .
BELLA: I told you , you have a fever . Probably that flu everyone has .
JACOB: It does n't feel like flu . I do n't know what it is . Off Jacob , rattled , and Bella , concerned
BELLA: Jacob . Please . Call me .
CHARLIE: Harry and I will be back by three
BELLA: He 's too sick to even call ?
CHARLIE: You just got ta wait it out . You know , I do n't have to go fishing
BELLA: No , go . I 'll call Jess or someone .
CHARLIE: Good . But stay here or at Jess 's . No hikes or anything . We 're issuing a warning about those bears . Off Bella 's nod
BELLA: Laurent ?
LAURENT: Bella . She beams , realizing he 's real .
BELLA: Laurent !
LAURENT: I must admit , I did n't expect to find you here .
BELLA: I live here . But you - I thought you were in Alaska with Carlisle 's friend .
LAURENT: Tanya , I was . It was kind of him to arrange , given my association with James and Victoria , `` The Enemy . ''
BELLA: You tried to help us .
LAURENT: I went to visit the Cullens , but thei house is empty . I 'm surprised they left you behind . Were n't you sort of a pet of theirs ?
BELLA: Um something like that .
LAURENT: Do the Cullens visit often ?
EDWARD: Lie .
BELLA: Absolutely . All the time .
EDWARD: Lie better .
BELLA: I 'll tell them you stopped by .
LAURENT: I do n't think so . Tanya 's `` vegetarian '' family was pleasant enough . But the dietary restrictions were difficult - living on nothing but animals .
BELLA: You 're still friends .
LAURENT: More or less . She asked me to get the lay of the land with the Cullens . Because , well I 'm afraid Victoria is quite put out with you .
BELLA: That 's too bad .
LAURENT: Yes . She feels it 's only fair to kill Edward 's mate , given he killed hers . Eye for an eye , mate for a mate .
EDWARD: Threaten him .
BELLA: Edward will know who did it . He 'll come after both of you .
LAURENT: I do n't think he will . After all , how much could you mean to him if he left you here unprotected ? Victoria sent me here for information . She wo n't be happy about my killing you .
BELLA: No , Laurent
LAURENT: No , no , no . Do n't be upset . I 'm doing you a kindness . Victoria plans on killing you slowly , painfully - whereas I 'll make it very quick . And you smell so mouth watering .
BELLA: Edward . I love you .
LAURENT: I do n't believe it .
EDWARD: Do n't . Move .
CHARLIE: Bella ? What 's wrong ?
BELLA: They 're not giant bears I saw them . Up in a meadow
CHARLIE: Damn it , I told you not to go into the woods !
HARRY CLEARWATER: What did you see , Bella ?
BELLA: Wolves . They 're wolves , Dad .
CHARLIE: Harry , can you get some men from the rez ?
HARRY CLEARWATER: Sure . Yeah . I 'll just
CHARLIE: Jerry ? Put a hunting party together tranq guns , large caliber shotguns there 's something dangerous out there .
BELLA: Good ! That 's good .

BELLA: I do n't know what you 're
JACOB: You know exactly what I 'm talking about .
BELLA: The Cullens are long gone . How are they to blame ?
JACOB: They started all this by existing . Goddamn leeches
SAM: Jacob .
JACOB: I ca n't be friends with you anymore .
BELLA: Jake , I know I hurt you . I should have been more up-front but I needed you , I still do . I do n't know what that means yet , but if you give me time
JACOB: Stop . Do n't . It 's not you
BELLA: `` It 's not you , it 's me ? '' God .
JACOB: It 's true . I 'm not good .
BELLA: You 're wrong
JACOB: It does n't matter . This is over
BELLA: I ca n't take losing my best friend , too .
JACOB: You already have

BELLA: I 'm going to change .
BELLA: What the hell are you doing ?
JACOB: Get out of the way .
BELLA: No !
JACOB: I pictured your room more cluttered .
BELLA: Why are you here ?
JACOB: I had to talk to you . Alone .
BELLA: To kick me in the gut again ? It was ad before , but you made it so much worse .
JACOB: I know . And I want to explain . But I ca n't .
BELLA: Then leave .
JACOB: Bella , I literally ca n't explain
BELLA: Find what out ?
JACOB: I ca n't do it .
BELLA: Yes , you can . I 'll help you . We can we can leave . Leave home , leave Sam .
JACOB: It 's not something I can run away from . I would run with you though . If I could . Wait . Wait , I already I told you . You know this you can guess .
BELLA: I do n't want to play games with you
JACOB: You have to ! I ca n't tell you , but if you remember - it was that day I ran into you at the beach . I told you a story come on ! I told you a story about ?
BELLA: about `` The Cold Ones ? '' You said it was a stupid tribal myth .
JACOB: Was it ? Are the Cold Ones a myth ? She does n't answer .
BELLA: That the tribe made a treaty with them . They ca n't come onto your land and I do n't know , I do n't remember .
JACOB: Try , Bella .
BELLA: You have to give me more . Tell me where to look . Is there something I should see ?
JACOB: No , that 's too dangerous
BELLA: I 'll take the risk . Jacob , show me .
JACOB: Where was the last place you saw me the way I used to be ?
BELLA: The motorcycles - that clearing in the woods .
PAUL: What the hell have you done ? !
JACOB: I did n't tell her . You 'd know if I did .
PAUL: She 's here , is n't she ?
SAM: Bella , there 's nothing to see here . You should go home .
BELLA: Not until I know what you did to Jacob .
PAUL: What we did ? !
SAM: Both of you , calm down
JACOB: Sam , she knows things about the loodsuckers . She 's been on the inside . She can help
PAUL: Like a leech lover 's gon na help us .
JACOB: Watch what you call her .
EMBRY: Get a grip , guys
BELLA: It 's alright , Jacob , I 'll go Paul and Jacob are beyond hearing .
PAUL: All you care about is her
SAM: Paul , back off .
PAUL: and she does n't give a crap about you
SAM: Jacob .
JARED: Too late .
SAM: Bella , get back !
BELLA: Run , Jacob !
SAM: Take Bella to Emily 's place .
EMBRY: Guess the wolf 's out of the bag . Off Bella , stunned .
BELLA: Wait . We should go back , make sure Jacob 's okay .
JARED: I hope Paul gets some teeth in him . Serve him right .
EMBRY: No way . Jake 's a natural . You see him phase on the fly ? I got ta five says Paul does n't touch him .
JARED: Easy money . Paul 's been at it longer .
EMBRY: Come on in . We wo n't bite .
JARED: Speak for yourself .
EMBRY: Oh , hey , about Emily - Sam 's fiance - just try not to stare . It bugs Sam .
BELLA: Why would I stare ? But the guys are already entering
EMILY: You guys hungry ? Like I have to ask
JARED: Bella Swan . Who else ?
EMILY: So you 're the vampire girl .
BELLA: And you 're a you 're all
EMILY: Werewolves ? I 'm just engaged to one . But these animals Save some for your brothers .
BELLA: He did n't say anything , or could n't .
EMBRY: That 's a wolf thing . Alpha 's orders get obeyed whether we want to or not
JARED: How ` bout you shut up now , Embry ?
EMBRY: You know Jacob 's gon na fill her in .
JARED: Yeah , I know every stupid thought he has . Wan na know what he thinks of you ?
EMILY: Like you need special powers to know that .
EMBRY: It 's another wolf thing . We hear each other 's thoughts . Good for hunting . Embarrassing for everything else . Jared leans to Bella , challenging .
JARED: Freaking out yet ?
BELLA: You 're not the first mind reade I 've met .
EMBRY: Jake 's right . You are good with the weird .
BELLA: But I do n't get how ? Why ?
SAM: And they 're getting worse .
EMBRY: Ha ! Pay up .
BELLA: You just have to stop .
JACOB: It 's not a life-style choice . It 's in my DNA .
BELLA: Killing is in your DNA ?
JACOB: Man , I thought maybe you would n't be such a hypocrite what , I 'm not the ight kind of monster for you ? Ca n't measure up to your bloodsucking friends
BELLA: Hey , they manage to survive without hurting innocent people .
JACOB: Wait - innocent ? so you do n't care that I morph into a giant dog . Just that I kill people ?
BELLA: `` Just ? '' Those hikers ' lives mean that little to you ? He bursts out laughing .
JACOB: Bella Bella wait We 're not killing hikers . We 're trying to protect them .
BELLA: From what ?
JACOB: The only thing we do kill Vampires .
BELLA: Vampires ? Jake , no
JACOB: Do n't worry , we ca n't touch you precious Cullens - unless they bite someone and violate the Treaty
BELLA: That 's not what I you ca n't fight vampires . They 're too dangerous .
JACOB: Please . We took out that leech with the dreads easy enough .
BELLA: You killed Laurent ?
JACOB: He did n't seem like a friend .
BELLA: No , God no . But how ?
JACOB: It 's what we do , why we exist . A few `` lucky guys '' in the tribe have the gene . If a bloodsucker moves to town , our DNA kicks in , we reach the right age and the fever hits
BELLA: `` Mono . ''
JACOB: I wish . Next thing I know , they 're telling me , this is your life now . That future you saw for yourself ? Gone . Desolation fills him . She sees this .
BELLA: It 's bad , huh ?
JACOB: I just hate feeling out of control . Like maybe Sam is right ; you should n't e around me .
BELLA: Like you could get rid of me .
JACOB: You 've seen Emily . That lands with her . She nods .
BELLA: You 're not like that . You save people , right ? You saved me from Laurent .
JACOB: Yeah , did n't mind taking him out . His ed-headed girlfriend will be fun , too . Bella stops , chilled to the bone .
BELLA: Victoria . She 's here ?
JACOB: We chased her all the way to the order the other night . But she wo n't stay gone . Keeps coming back if we knew what she was after What ?
BELLA: I know what she wants . Me .
VICTORIA: James hated cars . He liked being close to the ground . But I 'd steal one occasionally , to throw him off the scent See , we played hide and seek sometimes . No one can hide like me but no one could seek like James .
DENISE: What what are you ?
VICTORIA: Some games lasted months but we always got hungry for each other . So I 'd let him find me Denise now lucid , looks around to SEE
DENISE: Michael ? Oh my God
VICTORIA: We never could get enough of each other We would have had forever to try . Denise , scared , shakes Michael 's arm
DENISE: Michael ? !
VICTORIA: James always loved a screamer .
JARED: Excellent . If the redhead 's afte Bella , we 've got bait .
JACOB: She is not bait .
BELLA: I should leave town .
SAM: Victoria will follow you and make it harder for us to catch her .
BELLA: No one can catch her . She can escape anything .
PAUL: Ooh . She has special powers .
BELLA: Some of them do .
JACOB: Like what ? Bella ?
JARED: The mind reader you said you knew . He was a suckhead ? Can they all do that ?
EMBRY: That would blow .
BELLA: No , I should n't have - no .
PAUL: She 's still protecting them .
JARED: I do n't know why . It 's not like they stuck around to protect you
JACOB: Guys , back off .
BELLA: I could use the rush .
JACOB: Soon . After we catch her .
BELLA: You 're here .
EMILY: Bella . Are you okay ?
BELLA: Yeah , I just is Jacob here ? He was n't at home Sam appears behind Emily .
SAM: He 's with Jared and Embry , keeping an eye on things . I 'm heading out soon . Should I tell him something ?
EMILY: You want to come in ?
CHARLIE: You got something , Harry ?
HARRY CLEARWATER: Nope , nothin ' .
EDWARD: Stop this now , Bella .
BELLA: You wo n't stay with me any other way .
JACOB: Breathe , Bella ! C'mon !
BELLA: Jake ?
SAM: She 'll be alright .
JACOB: What the hell were you thinking ?
BELLA: I needed to see something .
JACOB: What ? The pearly gates ? If we had n't heard you scream
SAM: Get her home . I 'm heading to the hospital . I 'll meet you there . Jacob nods . Sam jogs off .
JACOB: Why would you jump ? Did n't you notice it 's like a hurricane out here ?
BELLA: I know . It was stupid Sam said hospital - someone 's hurt ?
JACOB: Harry Clearwater had a heart attack .
BELLA: Oh my God - does my Dad know ?
JACOB: He and my dad are both over there .
BELLA: Will Harry be okay ?
JACOB: I do n't know . Come on . I 'll find you something dry and drive you home .
BELLA: Must be nice , never getting cold .
JACOB: It 's a wolf thing .
BELLA: It 's a Jacob thing . You 're just warm .
JACOB: Like the sun .
BELLA: Like the sun .
JACOB: Which always comes back . You can count on me . She nods . Awkward silence . He fills it .
BELLA: Yeah , ` cause that would be fun .
JACOB: It 's better . Now that you know . But
BELLA: but
JACOB: It just comes so easily to me . More than the other guys .
BELLA: That 's a good thing , is n't it ?
JACOB: Maybe . Or maybe it makes me less human than the others . Sometimes I 'm scared I might disappear , you know ? Who I really am . Bella faces him , looks directly in his eyes .
BELLA: I wo n't let that happen .
JACOB: Holy crap !
BELLA: How do you know ?
JACOB: I can smell the stink . I 'm getting you out of here .
BELLA: Stop ! It 's not Victoria
JACOB: Forget it
BELLA: It 's Carlisle 's car ! They 're here . Go back !
JACOB: It 's a trick
BELLA: It 's okay . They 're my friends
JACOB: Do n't you get it ? If a Cullen is back here , this is their territory . The Treaty says we can only defend our own lands .
BELLA: It 's not a war
JACOB: It is . And you 'll only be safe in La Push . I ca n't protect you here anymore .
BELLA: I do n't need you to
JACOB: You 're about to cross a line
BELLA: Only if you draw one .
JACOB: I 'm not letting you do this .
BELLA: You do n't have a choice . I do n't elong to you .
JACOB: Bye , Bella , I hope you do n't die .
BELLA: Alice !
ALICE: You 're alive .
BELLA: Oh my God , Alice . You 're here .
ALICE: I heard voices - I did n't think it was you but - you 're alive .
BELLA: You keep saying that .
ALICE: I saw you - a vision of you - you jumped off a cliff . I knew I 'd be too late but Why the hell would you try to kill yourself ? !
BELLA: I did n't . I was cliff diving .
ALICE: Why ? !
BELLA: Um fun ?
ALICE: That was fun for you .
BELLA: Until I hit the water .
ALICE: I have never met anyone more prone to life-threatening idiocy and what is that hideous wet dog smell ?
BELLA: Oh . Probably Jacob . He 's kind of a werewolf . Off Alice 's horrified expression .
ALICE: Until they lose their tempers .
BELLA: They saved me from Laurent , they 're protecting me from Victoria
ALICE: Victoria ? I did n't see her . I did n't see you get pulled from the wate either .
BELLA: It was Jacob who saved me . More than once . I could n't have made it without him . You have no idea what it was like .
ALICE: Yes . I do . I knew leaving would n't e good for you . I tried to tell Edward , but he would n't listen .
BELLA: Does he know you 're here ?
ALICE: No . He 's been away
EDWARD: What ?
ROSALIE: Wait ! You should come home . Esme 's a wreck , Carlisle never smiles . Even Emmett 's depressed . You 've eally done a number on them .
EDWARD: I 'm sorry . I am . But they would n't e happier with me around . Trust me .
ROSALIE: I I just miss us . The family .
EDWARD: I know . But the further away I am , the safer Bella will be . She deserves a shot at a normal life
ROSALIE: But see , you do n't have to worry about that , not anymore
EDWARD: Why , Rose ? Did something happen ?
ROSALIE: I - uh
EDWARD: Tell me , Rosalie . Tell me !
ROSALIE: Alice had a vision . She saw Bella - - throw herself off a cliff She 's dead , Edward . Edward reels , uncomprehending .
EDWARD: I do n't believe it .
ROSALIE: Alice is there now . Thought she could help with the funeral or something . STAY ON ROSALIE as
CHARLIE: Thanks for understanding , Bells . They wanted to keep the service small .
BELLA: Do n't worry about me . Are you gon na e okay ?
CHARLIE: Yeah but Sue , and those kids Leah 's only a year older than you . And Seth 's , what , fourteen
ALICE: You 're not going ?
BELLA: I 'm not the most popular person on the werewolf rez right now .
ALICE: Because you 're friends with me .
BELLA: Alice .
ALICE: I 'll go do some hunting .
BELLA: Quil you , too ?
QUIL: Yeah . Me , too .
JACOB: You alone ?
BELLA: Yes . Should n't you be at the funeral ?
JACOB: Had to talk to you first . I 'll meet you there . Go on .
BELLA: Look , Jake , I 'm sorry I
JACOB: This place stinks to hell .
BELLA: You 're welcome to leave . In fact
JACOB: How many Cullens are here and how long are they staying ?
BELLA: Just Alice . And she 'll stay as long as she wants .
JACOB: Are the rest coming back ?
BELLA: Not that I 'm aware of . Anything else ?
JACOB: That 's it .
BELLA: Better go report to Sam .
JACOB: I 've done it again . I keep breaking my promise not to hurt you .
BELLA: It does n't have to be this way .
JACOB: Yeah , it does .
BELLA: Am I gon na lose you this time , Jacob ?
JACOB: It was easier when we were both human , was n't it ?
BELLA: Wait , who was it ?
JACOB: Dr. Carlisle Cullen .
BELLA: You should have let me talk to him .
JACOB: He did n't ask for you
BELLA: Alice , what 's wrong ?
ALICE: Edward .
BELLA: What about him ? What happened ?
ALICE: I just saw him in a vision . He thinks you 're dead .
BELLA: That was him calling , not Carlisle .
ALICE: Bella , he 's going to Italy to the Volturi
JACOB: Why do you have to go ?
BELLA: He wo n't believe Alice . He has to see that I 'm alive .
JACOB: He left you , Bella . He did n't want you anymore , remember ?
BELLA: But I still love him , and I 'm not gon na let him kill himself out of guilt .
JACOB: What about your dad ?
BELLA: I 'm eighteen , legally free to go . I 'll leave a note . Alice enters .
ALICE: Got the airline tickets .
JACOB: You Cullens might hunt animals but those monsters in Italy do n't .
ALICE: I 'm well aware what the Volturi are .
JACOB: Then why are you taking Bella to them like a bottle of wine to a party ?
ALICE: Right , she 's better off here with Victoria stalking her . The one you dogs ca n't seem to catch ?
BELLA: Let 's go .
JACOB: Please , Bella . Stay here . Fo Charlie for me .
BELLA: Bye , Jacob .
ALICE: Maybe Jacob 's right . No . You need to realize - the Volturi could easily see me as Edward 's accomplice . And you 're a human who knows too much and tastes too good . They could kill us all .
EDWARD: Have you decided ?
ARO: It was an intriguing debate . We do n't get many suicidal vampires .
CAIUS: Pathetic .
ARO: I 'm afraid your gifts are too valuable to destroy . But if you 're unhappy with your lot , join us . We 'd be delighted to utilize your skills .
EDWARD: So you wo n't end this .
MARCUS: Not without cause .
ARO: Such a waste .
BELLA: Where 'd you get the car ?
ALICE: Hope you 're not opposed to grand theft auto .
BELLA: Not today . Alice FLOORS it and the Porsche PEELS OUT
ALICE: He 's going to make the Volturi change their minds .
BELLA: It 's almost noon now .
ALICE: There 's Volterra . Alice punches it as Bella SEES
BELLA: Why are they all wearing red ?
ALICE: San Marcos Day festival . The perfect setting . Large crowds . The Volturi wo n't let him get far enough to reveal himself - he 's counting on that .
BELLA: We only have five minutes
ALICE: Follow that lane Bella 's already running
ITALIAN MAN: Fare attenzione !
BELLA: Edward !
EDWARD: Carlisle was right heaven
BELLA: No , I 'm here . I 'm alive .
EDWARD: You 're not real .
BELLA: Look at me ! Alice was wrong . He begins to realize she is real .
EDWARD: Bella ?
BELLA: Please , step back . I 'm alive , I 'm
EDWARD: You 're here .
BELLA: I 'm here .
EDWARD: I wo n't be needing your services afte all , gentlemen .
FELIX: Aro wants to speak with you again .
EDWARD: No rules were broken .
DEMETRI: We should take this conversation to a more appropriate venue .
EDWARD: Fine . Bella , why do n't you stay and enjoy the festival ?
FELIX: The girl comes with us .
EDWARD: That 's not going to happen
ALICE: Come on , guys , it 's a festival .
FELIX: There wo n't be any scene . And we 'll still win .
EDWARD: But not easily
BELLA: Who is she ?
ALICE: Just do as she says .
JANE: Follow me .
EDWARD: It 's alright . Alice will catch you .
GIANNA: Buon pomeriggio . They head through the lobby to
ARO: What a happy surprise ! Bella is alive after all . Is n't that wonderful ?
EDWARD: It 's not without effort .
ARO: I can see that . Off Bella 's look , Edward explains
EDWARD: One touch and Aro can see every thought I 've ever had in my life .
ARO: You 're quite the telepath yourself , Edward . Though you ca n't read Bella 's thoughts . Fascinating . He releases Edward 's hand and turns to Bella .
EDWARD: No !
ARO: Let 's see if she 's immune to all ou powers , shall we Jane ?
BELLA: Stop !
ARO: Jane , dear . The girl ?
MARCUS: You already know what you 'll do , Aro .
CAIUS: She knows too much ; she 's a liability .
ARO: That 's true . Unless Edward intends to give her immortality But that 's not your intention , is it . Shame .
BELLA: Edward , do n't !
ARO: Enough .
EDWARD: Get away from her !
ALICE: Edward , stop . I 've already seen it .
EDWARD: Alice , stay out of it .
ALICE: I know what to do .
ARO: Ah yes , the clairvoyant . I saw you gift in Edward 's thoughts . What is it you 've seen ?
EDWARD: do n't
ALICE: I 'm the one who will change Bella .
ARO: Please . Be my guest .
ALICE: Not here . Her father is in law enforcement . If she goes missing , there will be questions .
CAIUS: He is easily dealt with .
ALICE: It will happen , Aro . See fo yourself .
ARO: Mesmerizing ! To see the things you 've seen , that have n't happened yet ! Alice moves to Edward 's side , helps him up .
ALICE: I 'm so sorry .
ARO: Your gifts will make for an intriguing immortal . Go make your preparations .
CAIUS: You 're letting them leave ?
ARO: Dear Caius , the girl 's disappearance will be conspicuous at best . And surely you see her potential .
MARCUS: Let us be done with this . Heidi will arrive any moment .
CAIUS: We will make sure she follows through . I would not delay . We do not offe second chances .
DEMETRI: Nice fishing , Heidi , save some for me .
HEIDI: This way , please . Stay together
TOURIST HUSBAND: Unusual tour , is n't it ?
TOURIST WIFE: Bill , get a picture of that bust there .
BELLA: Stop !
EDWARD: Go back to sleep . You 've been through a lot .
BELLA: No , you might
EDWARD: I 'll be here when you wake up . Beat , she looks at him , wary .
BELLA: Why ? Out of guilt ?
EDWARD: You think I asked the Volturi to kill me because I felt guilty ?
BELLA: Did n't you ?
EDWARD: I went to them because I thought I 'd lost you .
BELLA: You did n't even want me . Now Edward takes her by the shoulders .
EDWARD: Bella . The only reason I left was to protect you . I wanted you to have a chance at a normal , happy life .
BELLA: But it was so easy for you to leave .
EDWARD: I had to be convincing . But easy ? In my hundred years , I 've never had a harder time than what I just went through . She 's beginning to believe him .
BELLA: I kept seeing you . Visions of you . Always protecting me . I thought I was going crazy .
EDWARD: Your own instincts were speaking to you . I wish it had been me . But you 're the heroic one . You saved me .
CHARLIE: You alright ? Another nightmare ?
BELLA: I 'm okay . You do n't have to worry .
CHARLIE: Last time you said that , you disappeared . You want to talk nightmares ?
BELLA: I 'm really sorry , Dad .
CHARLIE: Just do n't ever do that to me again . Okay ? And you 're grounded for the rest of your life .
BELLA: I know .
CHARLIE: Get some rest so I can keep lecturing you in the morning .
EDWARD: He wo n't forgive me easily .
BELLA: Nope .
EDWARD: Will you ? I do n't deserve it but I hope you will . Because I honestly have no idea how to live without you . Bella melts in his eyes . He kisses her .
BELLA: You wo n't be able to get rid of me once Alice changes me .
EDWARD: She wo n't have to . There are ways to keep the Volturi in the dark .
BELLA: They 'll come after your whole family . You 'd risk that just to keep me human ?
EDWARD: Just ? You really do n't understand what you 'd be giving up .
BELLA: I really do .
EDWARD: You ca n't be serious
BELLA: This is my meeting , Edward .
EMMETT: The hell you will . I 'm not missing another fight .
BELLA: That 's not up for a vote , Emmett . I do n't want you involved .
ESME: We 've always been involved , honey , and we 're not going to stop
BELLA: No , please I want you to seriously think about this . If I join you , you 'll be stuck with me for a long time - forever . It 's a huge decision . And I want - I need your honesty here . They nod or otherwise communicate agreement .
ALICE: Like you 're not already my sister . Of course , yes !
JASPER: I vote yes . It 'll be a relief not to want to kill you .
BELLA: Um . Thanks ? Okay , Rosalie ?
ROSALIE: Edward , I 'm sorry for what I did . I eally am . And I know you 're not eady to forgive me But this is n't the life I 'd have chosen for myself . I wish there 'd een someone to vote no for me So no .
EMMETT: I vote hell yeah . We can pick a fight with these Volturi some other way . Esme approaches and embraces Bella warmly .
ESME: I already think of you as part of the family . Yes .
BELLA: Thank you , Esme . Carlisle moves , not to Bella , but to
CARLISLE: Edward
EDWARD: You ca n't go along with this , Carlisle , you know what it means .
CARLISLE: You 've chosen not to live without her , which leaves me no choice . I wo n't lose my son . But Alice has never turned anyone . It 'd be safer if I did it
BELLA: Thank you . Thank you all .
VICTORIA: Where you headed ?
DRIVER: Seattle .
VICTORIA: Sounds perfect . As she climbs in
EDWARD: When ?
BELLA: After graduation .
EDWARD: Just two months .
BELLA: It 'll be best for Dad that way . I can pretend to be at college somewhere . Carlisle suggested it . But I wish you 'd be the one to change me .
EDWARD: Would you be willing to trade for that ?
BELLA: Name it .
EDWARD: Five more years as a human .
BELLA: The Volturi wo n't wait that long .
EDWARD: I 'll settle for three .
BELLA: I wo n't risk it . It 'll have to be Carlisle . He takes her hand .
EDWARD: Why are you so willing to give up you soul ?
BELLA: Because I do n't believe you 've lost yours . And I want to share mine with you forever .
EDWARD: He wants to talk to me .
BELLA: Well , he can talk to me first . She pushes out of the car
JACOB: You 're still alive .
BELLA: I 've been calling you .
JACOB: Could n't drop by ?
EDWARD: He thinks I 'm keeping you away .
JACOB: Stay the hell out of my head !
BELLA: Dad grounded me , Jake . We 're trying to get back before he wakes up .
EDWARD: Jacob , I know you have something to say to me , but I 'd like to say something first . Alright ?
JACOB: No , you did n't . And it was n't fo your benefit , trust me .
EDWARD: I know . I 'm still grateful . But I 'm back now . And I 'm not leaving Bella 's side till she orders me away .
JACOB: We 'll see .
EDWARD: Either way , we 'll handle Victoria from here on out .
JACOB: She 's been laying low . Ever since your freaky sister showed up . Guess she ca n't stand you Cullens either .
EDWARD: She 'll come back .
JACOB: She does , she 's ours . She killed on our turf .
EDWARD: We 'll see .
JACOB: My turn to talk . I 'm here to remind you about a key point in the Treaty .
EDWARD: I have n't forgotten .
JACOB: Good .
BELLA: What ? What key point ?
JACOB: If any of them bites a human , the truce is over . That 's bite , not kill .
BELLA: But if I choose it , it 's none of your business .
JACOB: If you what ! ? No . No way . I wo n't let you
EDWARD: Bella , step back
JACOB: You 're not gon na be one of them .
BELLA: That 's not your call
JACOB: You know what we 'll do to you - I wo n't have a choice
EDWARD: We 're done here
JACOB: You do n't speak for her !
BELLA: Stop !
EDWARD: Get out of here . Now !
BELLA: You do this , you 'll be going through me .
EDWARD: I 'm here . Always .
DESMOND: OK , Gordon .
DESMOND: OK , Gordon .
DESMOND: Okay , Gordon ! ! !
DESMOND: Smell something fishy , huh ?
STANLEY: It 's a pleasure . I 've heard a lot about you .
DESMOND: Congratulations . I heard about that .
DESMOND: Federal ? Cole gives him the thumbs up . Lil finishes her dance .
COLE: GOOD LUCK , CHET .
DESMOND: Right , Gordon . We 'll be in touch .
STANLEY: That was really something . That dancing girl . What did it mean ?
DESMOND: Code . If you work with Gordon you learn that right away .
STANLEY: Code , I 've heard a lot about this .
DESMOND: Sort of shorthand .
STANLEY: Shorthand . really ?
DESMOND: We 're heading into a difficult situation .
STANLEY: How do you figure ?
DESMOND: I 'll explain it to you . Do you remembe Lil 's dance ? As Desmond explains we -
STANLEY: What do you mean ?
DESMOND: Her face had a sour look that means we 're going to have trouble with the local authorities . They are not going to e receptive to the FBI .
STANLEY: Oh , the uncle is missing .
DESMOND: Not Cole 's Uncle but probably the sheriff 's uncle in federal prison .
STANLEY: So the sheriff had got an Uncle who 's committed a serious crime .
DESMOND: Right , which is probably why Lil was wearing a red wig meaning we are headed into a dangerous situation . Let me ask you something , Stanley , did you notice anything about the dress ?
STANLEY: The dress she was wearing had been altered to fit her . I noticed a different colored thread where the dress had been taken in . It was n't her dress or she must have lost some weight .
DESMOND: Gordon said you were good . The tailored dress is our code for drugs . Did you notice what was pinned to it ?
STANLEY: A blue rose .
DESMOND: Very good , but I ca n't tell you about that . Stanley rides along quietly for a while .
STANLEY: What did Gordon 's tie mean ?
DESMOND: What ? That 's just Gordon 's bad taste .
STANLEY: Why could n't he have just told you all these things ?
DESMOND: He talks loud . And he loves his code .
STANLEY: I see . He does talk loud .
DESMOND: Gordon would not have sent us to Dee Meadow without thinking it was a high priority situation .
STANLEY: It must be a high priority situation .
DESMOND: Good afternoon , Federal Bureau of Investigation , Special Agent Chet Desmond . I 'd like to see Sheriff Cable . Cliff just smiles for a long minute .
CLIFF: Why do n't you folks have a seat . Make yourself at home . It 's gon na be a while .
DESMOND: Okay , that 's it . I 've had enough of the waiting room now .
CLIFF: Oh .
DESMOND: You can start that FRESH pot of coffee ight now .
CABLE: How the hell did you Desmond shows his credentials .
DESMOND: Federal Bureau of Investigation , Special Agent Chet Desmond .
CABLE: Well , little fella , we do n't need any outside help here . I do n't like you people sniffin ' around my neck of the woods . In fact , when the state boys called me about a `` J. Edgar '' coming up I think I said , `` So what ? ''
DESMOND: Your behavior is not funny and is wasting the time of the Federal Government .
CABLE: You 're lucky I am not wasting you .
DESMOND: Well , little fella , let me put it this way . The operative word here would be `` Federal '' . With or without the semantics of all this , I am now ordering you to release all pertinent information concerning Teresa Banks , both while living and deceased .
CABLE: A basic kill . Banks was a drifter and nobody knew her . My boys have been all over this . It 's a dead end .
DESMOND: That 's why we 're here , Sheriff Cable . Where 's the body ?
CABLE: Out back in our morgue Desmond starts to leave . CABLE It 's 4 30 . We close at five .
DESMOND: We 've got our own clock . We 'll lock up .
STANLEY: You know , Agent Desmond , I figure this whole office , furniture included , is worth 27,000 dollars .
DESMOND: Teresa Banks lived at the Canyon Trailer Park for a month . We 'll check that . And worked as a waitress at Hap 's Truck Stop . Worked the Night Shift . Good place for dinner when we 're thru here , Sam . No one came to claim the body and no known next of kin .
STANLEY: Solved the Whiteman Case with this .
DESMOND: That 's what I heard .
STANLEY: No one could find those splinters without a machine like this . And no one had a machine like this .
DESMOND: That 's good .
STANLEY: Yes , it is good . What do you think is in these othe drawers ?
DESMOND: I do n't know , Sam .
STANLEY: Maybe , later we could take a look .
DESMOND: Sure , but let 's finish up with this first .
STANLEY: Crushed skull . Probable cause repeated lows to the back of the head with an obtuse angled blunt object . Subject looks to be between 16 and 18 years of age .
DESMOND: Cole said she was 17 . Stanley 's eyes drift to Teresa 's left hand .
STANLEY: I wonder where her ring is ? Desmond notices the mark on her hand as well .
DESMOND: Yeah . Personal effects include a watch , unde garments , and a blue waitress uniform the ring is missing . It says the rest of her things have n't been emoved yet from the trailer . Let 's hope it 's there . Stanley picks up her left hand .
STANLEY: There appears to be a contusion unde the ring finger of her left hand .
DESMOND: Oh . Stanley peers underneath the fingernail .
STANLEY: A laceration .
DESMOND: Accidental ?
STANLEY: Agent Desmond , would you hold the finger for me . There 's something up there .
DESMOND: What is it ?
STANLEY: It is a piece of paper with the letter `` T '' imprinted on it . Take a look . Desmond comes around and takes a look . On a piece of paper .
DESMOND: We 're not . You and I are going to get some food .
STANLEY: Yes , it 's been several hours since we 've eaten . I did n't realize that so much time had past , did you , Agent Desmond ? Desmond takes a long look at Stanley . STANLEY You 've got your own M.O. , do n't you , Agent Desmond ? Desmond gets in and starts the car .
JACK: Had the FBI here once before . Back in the fifties when Hap was running the place .
DESMOND: Where 's Hap ?
JACK: He 's dead - good and dead .
DESMOND: Sorry to hear it .
JACK: He did n't suffer .
DESMOND: I 'd like to ask you a few questions about Teresa Banks
JACK: Sheriff Cable 's already asked me a few questions about Teresa Banks . She worked nights for a month . That 's it .
DESMOND: Any friends ?
JACK: No .
DESMOND: Ever see her with someone else ?
JACK: No .
DESMOND: Did she ever mention any friends ?
JACK: No . Ask Irene over there .
IRENE: Take a good look around . There 's nobody in this place - you 're meetin ' the reason why . What 'll it be ?
DESMOND: How come Jack let 's you work here ?
IRENE: Jack and I are united in holy matrimony .
DESMOND: Say no more .
IRENE: She only worked here a month . Nice girl . Never seemed to get here on time though . Ask me she had a little problem with
DESMOND: What happened to her ?
IRENE: There was only one job . Teresa took the job . Her friend took a hike . Never saw her again .
DESMOND: Did you ever see Teresa take cocaine ?
IRENE: No .
DESMOND: Do you take cocaine , Irene ?
IRENE: No , I do not . I never took cocaine or any other drugs . I do n't take drugs .
STANLEY: Nicotine is a drug . Caffeine is a drug .
IRENE: Who 's Shorty ? Those drugs are legal .
DESMOND: He 's with me . Anything you would like to tell us about Teresa Banks that would help us out ?
IRENE: I 've thought about that . I think he death is what you would call a `` freak accident '' .
DESMOND: Thanks .
OLD GUY: You talking about that little girl that was murdered ?
DESMOND: You have something to tell us ?
OLD GUY: Yeah .
DESMOND: What ?
OLD GUY: I can tell shit from shinolah . Gets me along way down that road . Desmond moves away from him .
STANLEY: You think we ought to question him ?
DESMOND: What time is it , Stanley ?
STANLEY: Oh Desmond guides his laugh into a cough .
DESMOND: It 's late , Sam .
STANLEY: It 's not late , it 's early . Really early .
IRENE: You know , I never told anybody , but once for about three days , just before he time , Teresa 's arm went completely dead .
DESMOND: What do you mean ?
IRENE: Her left arm . It was numb . She said she could n't use it . Said it had no feeling . Probably from the drugs she was taking . I just thought I ought to tell you .
DESMOND: Thanks . Stanley watches her leave .
STANLEY: I doubt it was drugs , more likely a problem with a nerve . I could recheck the arm for injuries , but for real nerve work we are going to have to take the ody back to Portland .
DESMOND: I think that 's a good idea .
STANLEY: Are you speaking to me in a code ?
DESMOND: No , Sam , I 'm speaking plainly and I mean just exactly what I say .
STANLEY: In that case , we should go to the Canyon Trailer Park .
STANLEY: Nine 's really late . We are really early .
CARL: God damn , this better be important .
DESMOND: Federal Bureau of Investigation , Special Agent Chet Desmond and Agent Sam Stanley . Sorry to disturb you , but we would like to see Teresa Banks ' trailer , please .
CARL: More popular than Uncle 's Day at a whorehouse .
DESMOND: Did she have someone with her ?
CARL: Right . She had a friend with her . The friend took off .
DESMOND: Was there an argument ?
CARL: Not that I know of . But arguments do happen , do n't they ?
DESMOND: Yes they do . Did she have visitors ?
CARL: No , hey , I already told this whole damn thing to Sheriff `` Not-Quite-Able '' Here 's the trailer now . He swings open the door . CARL And this is exactly the way she left it . I never touched a GOD DAMN THING .
STANLEY: She lived alone .
DESMOND: She must have known someone .
STANLEY: I 'll get my kit .
DESMOND: Take a look at this .
STANLEY: She 's wearing a ring . Stanley studies it .
DESMOND: My guess is there is n't enough detail in the photo to get an idea of the design on the ring , but we should do a blowup of this anyway .
STANLEY: May I see the magnifying glass , Agent Desmond ? There does n't seem to be enough detail in the photo to ascertain the design on the ring . Carl leans in from the outside .
CARL: I 'm gon na make myself some Good Morning America . You want some ? Both nod `` yes '' .
DESMOND: You were n't kiddin ' . This stuff 's got the sting of the forty-eight hour blend .
CARL: That 's right . That 's the best coffee you 're gon na get around here .
STANLEY: We really do need a good `` wake me up '' , do n't we , Agent Desmond ? We really do need a good `` wake me up '' , do n't we , Agent Desmond ?
DESMOND: Did you know Teresa Banks ?
CLIFF: Hey , how 's J. Edgar doin ' ? Bet you appreciate them bustin ' you mornin ' in half , eh , Carl ? Bet they woke you up .
CARL: They 're only doing their job .
DESMOND: What are you doing here in the traile court , Deputy ?
CLIFF: Maybe I just live here , what do you think about that ?
DESMOND: Can I ask you where you were the night Teresa Banks was murdered ?
CLIFF: You can tell J. Edgar that I was at a party and I got fifteen fuckin ' witnesses .
CARL: Maybe if you did a little less partyin ' that little girl would still be alive .
CLIFF: Is that right , Mr. Jack Daniels ?
DESMOND: Did you know Teresa Banks ?
CLIFF: Got a couple of cups of coffee at Hap 's from her . That 's it . By the way where do you get off questioning a lawman ? I could ask you the same question .
DESMOND: No you could n't .
CARL: Not a lot around here , no . Got some clubs , but not very many fellas with alls .
DESMOND: Thanks for your help , Carl . Sorry we woke you up .
CARL: That 's alright . I was having a bad dream . I was dreamin ' about a joke with no punchline .
STANLEY: I could n't help but notice that you had a suspicion that Deputy Cliff was the murderer . You did think that , did n't you , Agent Desmond ?
DESMOND: He 's not the murderer . But he 's a bozo .
STANLEY: Yes , he is like a clown .
CABLE: What the hell is that thing doing out there ? You 're not taking that body anywhere .
DESMOND: We 're taking the body back to Portland and there 's not a thing you can do about it .
CABLE: Maybe not _a_ thing , but maybe _two_ things .
DESMOND: Teresa Banks had a ring . Any idea what happened to it ?
CABLE: We got a phone , here , that 's got a little ing .
DESMOND: Sam , get the body and put it in the van . Sheriff Cable , where were you the night Teresa Banks was murdered ?
CABLE: My alibi is as strong as these bands of steel .
STANLEY: When he says , `` Discussion '' , how do you take that , Agent Desmond ?
DESMOND: I do n't take it , Sam . I give it .
CABLE: Now , J. Edgar , I 'm going to take off my adge , here . Do you mind ? The only way you 're going to get that ody is over mine .
CLIFF: You try that you little monkey .
DESMOND: I think I 'll take off my badge as well .
STANLEY: One thing that has been troubling me . That lamp at the diner . Do you think they were working on it for esthetic easons or was their work due to faulty wiring ?
DESMOND: Faulty wiring .
STANLEY: Esthetics are subjective , are n't they , Agent Desmond ? I 'm Sam Stanley . If you ever need me .
DESMOND: Thanks , Sam , for the good work . You have a good eye for detail .
STANLEY: We do notice things , do n't we , Agent Desmond ? Are you going back to the trailer park for the Blue rose ? Desmond smiles at Stanley as they shake .
STANLEY: 83,000 dollars .
CARL: And that 's Deputy Cliff 's trailer ove there . The red one .
CHET: Right .
CARL: I 'll be in my trailer if you need me .
ALBERT: Six to eight hands clapping . I was eferring to the possibility of a little silence . The phone rings and Cole answers it .
COOPER: I know you have n't changed your hair and I 've seen that beautiful dress before , ut I must say , Diane , you look sensational today .
STANLEY: Agent Chet said he wanted to check the trailer court one more time . He had me drive the van with the body back here . Which we did . It was 105 miles .
COOPER: Anything else ?
STANLEY: Did Gordon show you a woman named Lil ?
COOPER: I 'm up to speed , Stanley .
STANLEY: Agent Chet would n't tell me what the Blue Rose meant .
COOPER: And neither will I .
STANLEY: Oh , alright . You know , I liked Agent Desmond . He had his own M.O .
COOPER: Stanley , I heard all about it .
STANLEY: No one could 've found those splinters without a machine like this and no one has a machine like this .
COOPER: Tell me about the letter .
STANLEY: Take a look at this . Chet and I found it under Teresa Banks ' ring fingernail .
COOPER: And no one found the ring ?
STANLEY: No , sir , we did not .
CARL: GOD . I 'm beginning to lose faith in the United States Government and that includes the telephone system . Do n't you folks talk to one another . That 's he trailer there and I have n't touched a god damn thing . Agent Chet Desmond come y a second time and asked too see Deputy Cliff Howard 's traile which I showed him . I went back to my trailer After that I never saw him again .
COOPER: Thank you , Carl .
CARL: That 's not the way to Cliff 's trailer . I told you .
COOPER: I am not going to Cliff 's trailer .
CARL: Well , where are you going ?
COOPER: I am going over here .
CARL: God damn , you people are confusing .
COOPER: What was here , Mr. Rodd ?
CARL: A trailer was here . What the hell do you think ?
COOPER: Can you tell me who 's trailer it was and who stayed in the trailer ?
CARL: An old woman and her grandson .
COOPER: Can you tell me what their names were ?
CARL: Chalfont . Weird . Chalfont was the name of the folks that rented the space efore they did . Two Chalfonts .
COOPER: Is that Agent Desmond 's vehicle ?
CARL: Yep , it sure is . Cooper walks to it .
COOPER: Diane , it 's 4 20 in the afternoon . I am standing here at Wind River where they found the body of Teresa Banks . Diane , this case has got a strange feeling fo me . Not only has Agent Cheste Desmond disappeared but this is one of Cole 's Blue Rose cases . The clues that were found by Agent Desmond and Agent Stanley have lead to dead ends . The letter below the fingernail gives me the feeling that the killer will strike again . But like the song says , `` who knows where or when '' .
COOPER: Gordon , it is 10 10 , on February 15th .
GORDON: SO ?
COOPER: I was worried about today from the dream I told you about .
COLE: RIGHT .
HEAD CLERK: Here 's your key , Mr. Jeffries . I hope you enjoy your stay here at The Palm Deluxe . This is for you . The joven ah young lady she left it .
BELLHOP: 612 - very nice .
COOPER: Gordon . Cooper runs into Gordon 's office .
COLE: PHILLIP !
ALBERT: Phillip ?
COOPER: Phillip ?
JEFFRIES: I 'm not going to talk about Judy . Keep Judy out of this .
COOPER: But Cole calms Cooper .
COLE: STAND FAST , COOP .
JEFFRIES: Who do you think that is there ?
ALBERT: Suffered some bumps on the old noggin ' , eh , Phil ?
JEFFRIES: I want to tell you everything , but I do n't have a lot to go on . But I 'll tell you one thing Judy is positive about this .
ALBERT: How interesting . I thought we were going to keep Judy out of this . Jeffries stumbles to a chair .
JEFFRIES: Listen to me carefully . I saw one of their meetings . It was above a convenience store .
ALBERT: Who 's meeting ? Where have you been ?
JEFFRIES: It was a dream . We live inside a dream .
ALBERT: And it 's raining Post Toasties .
JEFFRIES: NO , NO . I found something in Seattle at Judy 's And then , there they were
FIRST WOODSMAN: We have descended from pure air .
BOB: Light of new discoveries .
MRS. TREMOND: Why not be composed of materials and combinations of atoms ?
FIRST WOODSMAN: Our world .
SECOND WOODSMAN: Boneless .
MIKE: Yes , find the middle place . Bob begins to scream with anger .
TREMOND'S GRANDSON: Fell a victim . The Man From Another Place raises his hand .
BOB: Fire Walk With Me .
JEFFRIES: I followed . Jeffries begins to cry quietly at his table .
JEFFRIES: May ? 1989 ?
COOPER: What ?
ALBERT: I 've got the front desk right now . He never was here . No record of him entering the building and the doctors should be here any minute .
COOPER: What 's going on ? Albert rushes back into the room .
COOPER: Teresa Banks .
COLE: ALBERT ?
ALBERT: Tylenol .
COOPER: It was a year ago today that Teresa Banks was killed . I 'm wondering if the murderer will ever kill again .
ALBERT: No offense , sir , but after a day with you it is mandatory .
JEFFRIES: Hey hey
BELLHOP: Oh , Mr. Jeffries . De shit it come out of my ass ! Santa Maria , where did you go ?
COOPER: He was here .
LAURA: Donna ? Donna ?

LAURA: I do n't know what to do .

LAURA: Gobble , gobble , gobble . He smiles . She kisses him and he responds .
JAMES: Do n't ever leave , Laura , ever . I 'll neve leave you .
BOBBY: Where were you for the last hour ? I 've een lookin ' for you ?
LAURA: I was right behind you , but you 're too dumb to turn around . If he turned around he might get dizzy and fall down .
LAURA: Get lost Bobby .
BOBBY: Oh , yeah ? You 'll be callin ' soon and maybe I 'm not gon na be there .
LAURA: Oh , come on , sweetie , give me one of your smiles .
BOBBY: Love ya , Babe .

LAURA: Maybe .
DONNA: Oh god , Laura .
LAURA: Well , why not ?

LAURA: Yes , James is very sweet . Why do n't you get out your violin , Donna ?
DONNA: Sweet ? God , he 's gorgeous .
LAURA: James is very sweet and very gorgeous . Donna drifts off .
DONNA: I wonder if Mike could ever write a poem ? Both of them drift off . DONNA Do you think that if you were falling in space you would slow down after a while or go faster and faster ?
LAURA: Faster and faster . For a long time you would n't feel anything . Then you would urst into fire forever .
DONNA: Maybe I better start our homework .
LAURA: Okay , I suppose I should go home .
DONNA: Call me .
LAURA: Sure . What do you want me to call you ?
DONNA: Call me anything just do n't call me late for dinner . They laugh .
LAURA: Mom Mom ? No answer - she heads up to her room .
SARAH: Laura , honey Cigarette Cigarette Laura takes it out of her mouth .
LAURA: Can I take the car ?
SARAH: Sure honey , what 's the hurry ?
LAURA: I forgot my books at school . Laura runs from the house .
SARAH: Laura .
LAURA: What ?
SARAH: You 'll never be a smoker if you do n't SARAH start . I mean it .
HAROLD: Laura ?
LAURA: My secret diary . There are pages missing .
HAROLD: Who would do that ?

LAURA: What were you doing in my room ?
SARAH: I was looking for that blue sweater that you borrowed which I found balled up in the bottom of your closet . Now why did you lie to me ? Where did you go ?
LAURA: I had to see Bobby . I know you really do n't like Bobby , but there was a problem and I did n't think you would understand .

TRUCKER: Friend of Leo 's , right ? Partyland ?
LAURA: If you can fuck and drive the party starts right now .
ALBERT: Cooper , the ooze of mumbo jumbo is ising up above our heads . Do you honestly think Cole 's practice of word association works ?
COOPER: The very fact that we are talking about word association means we are in a space that was opened up by ou practice of word association . The world is a hologram , Albert .
ALBERT: Yes , it 's a great big psychedelic circus ide , is n't it , Cooper ?
COOPER: Albert .
ALBERT: You said , `` Teresa Banks '' , so you think something is going on somewhere in the world right now that is connected with her murder ?
COOPER: Yes . Either right now or right when I thought of it . The name and memory of Teresa Banks is haunting me . Lately I have been filled with a knowingness that the murderer will strike again . Because it is only a feeling , I am powerless to stop it . And another thing , Albert , when the next murder happens you will help me solve it .
ALBERT: Let 's test it for the record . Will the next victim be a man or a woman ?
COOPER: A woman .
ALBERT: What color hair will she have ?
COOPER: Blonde .
ALBERT: Tell me some other things about her .
COOPER: She 's in high school . She 's sexually active . She 's on drugs . She 's crying out for some help .
ALBERT: You 're describing half the high school girls in America . What is she doing right now ?
COOPER: She is preparing a great abundance of food .
NORMA: Shelly , would you give Laura a quick hand with the `` Meals on Wheels '' ?
SHELLY: I 'm kind of busy , Norma .
NORMA: You 're not busy , sweetheart , now go .
NADINE: I changed my mind , I do n't want any coffee , Eddie .
ED: Sorry , Norma . Ed goes out .
SHELLY: Can I give you a hand getting the dinners together ?
LAURA: That 's alright , Shelly . I know you have etter things to do .
SHELLY: Norma asked me to give you a hand .

SHELLY: Okay .
NORMA: What 's with that Laura ? Yeah , sure , take a look around . There 's no one here anyway .
SHELLY: You 're right . There 's no one here .
NORMA: There 's no one here .
SHELLY: Norma , are you alright ?
NORMA: Come back as soon as you can .
SHELLY: If Leo comes here , he wo n't believe that I am out doing the `` Meals on Wheels '' .
NORMA: Do n't worry , Shelly , I 'll handle Leo . Shelly leaves the diner .
TOAD: Kind of quiet .
LAURA: He 's looking for the book , he 's going to the hiding place !
WOMAN: Laura A closer look reveals how upset Laura is .
LAURA: I lost my necklace it must have fallen .
WOMAN: Well , I 'm glad you found it , darling .
DONNA: Laura ?
LAURA: Donna , are you my best friend ?
DONNA: Of course Laura dives toward Donna and into a hug .
LAURA: I just want a friend . Just one friend fo just one minute
DONNA: Laura , how about one friend for the rest of your whole life ?
LAURA: Yes , that 's what I want . Thanks D .
DONNA: Okay , L. I am your friend always . But sometimes lately I feel that you do n't like being around me because I am so uptight . No , I am uptight . I hate it I do n't want to be this way , but Laura I do n't I mean I 'm your friend no matter what way you are .
LAURA: You know , even when I think about you face I get happier . They go in and sit down on the couch .

JOSIE: I do n't want to offend the customs of your country .
TRUMAN: Believe me , Josie , you would not offend the customs of this country . Fo instance , I do n't eat fish eyes .
JOSIE: Fish eyes ?
TRUMAN: Even if it offended someone , I would n't eat a fish eye .
JOSIE: Why would n't you eat a fish eye , Harry ?
TRUMAN: I saw a guy eat a fish eye once in Seattle . He was digging through his food with his chopsticks for about five minutes till he found the fish eye and he dropped it into his throat . I guess it must have gotten stuck in his uvula ecause right away he started to have trouble . His throat began to flutte there like there was a wind blowing . And he could n't swallow and they rushed to him and loosened his collar and they were asking him if he was alright and he started to turn blue and his eyes started to roll back into his head and he still could n't get the fish eye out and they tried to do a Heimlich maneuver . I went over to him as they were preparing to do an emergency tracheotomy . They were over him with a knife when he suddenly shot the fish eye out of his throat and right onto the ceiling . Splat ! It just stuck up there and spread out . It was about the size of a half dollar . And that 's why I do n't eve eat fish eyes . He plays the guitar for Josie . Then stops . TRUMAN I 'm not saying it 's right or wrong , it 's just the way I feel . It 's the custom thing I was thinking of . In America we do n't use any part of the fish but the meat just to the side of the insides . We throw away the tail , the rest of the insides and the head .
JOSIE: I understand .
TRUMAN: We throw away the _whole_ head .
DONNA: I ca n't remember anything about last night . Is there something I should emember ?
LAURA: No , you should forget about last night .

MOTHER SUPERIOR: We 've only had one fire at St. Charlotte 's . Vince Benedict started it , we like to think by accident .
JULIUS: Tell me about him . Was he a good athlete ? Did he like chess and poetry ?
MOTHER SUPERIOR: I 'm certain that God had a purpose when he created Vincent Benedict , ut it had nothing to do with chess or poetry .
JULIUS: I always liked biology .
MOTHER SUPERIOR: So did Vincent . He disgraced Sister Maria , who had to leave the order . Then he stole all the money from our library fund and an away .

LINDA: Angel 's food or devil 's food ?
MARNIE: The answer 's obvious .
LINDA: There 's only one Vince Benedict . He 's a force of nature .
MARNIE: And that 'poetry ' he pretends to write . They 're old song lyrics , Linda .
LINDA: I know that Geez , you do n't think I know that ? It 's so cute , the way he thinks he 's tricking me . Anyway , what 's wrong about other people 's songs ? Some guys tell you dirty jokes . It just proves that Vince has a omantic soul .
MARNIE: She 's not bad
JULIUS: I 'm sorry . I had no idea these magazines had things like that inside them .
MARNIE: You did n't ? Where 've you been ? A desert island ?
JULIUS: As a matter of fact , a small tropical island , in the South Pacific , about 300 nautical miles south-southwest of Fiji . I only
MARNIE: Your brother ?

MARNIE: Twins ?
VINCE: Goodbye girls , see you soon . And he guns off .
JULIUS: Goodbye girls , see you soon .
MARNIE: Why do I think I 'm going to see him again ? Like maybe tomorrow .
JULIUS: Linda is your girl friend , is n't she ?
VINCE: Yeah . Kind of .
JULIUS: Is Marnie your girl friend , too ?
VINCE: Marnie ! Marnie hates my guts . She seemed to like you .
JULIUS: She hardly knows me . A beat .
VINCE: That 's the best way women love men who are mysterious and devious . It keeps them on their toes makes them excited you know what I mean ?
JULIUS: No .
VINCE: You do like women , do n't you ?
JULIUS: Very much , they 're strange and sensitive and they have compassion . I have the highest espect for women .
VINCE: Now correct me if I 'm wrong . You 're a virgin , are n't you ?
JULIUS: That 's private .
JULIUS: You named your cat , Julius ? Vince freezes , realizing the implications .
VINCE: The secret to take-out veal Parmesan is adding a little extra cheese . I know you 're probably used to growing your own vegetables and spearing fish in the lagoon , ut here on the mainland we just nuke it ! The microwave ALARM sounds , and it pops open .
PARKING SPOT: It 's definitely empty .
JULIUS: He won the Nobel Prize . Vince , playing along , rolls his eyes .
VINCE: Naturally so all of our dads were these big shots and Mom was , like , Superwoman , but she did n't survive our delivery . I got sent to an orphanage while you were ought up in a tropical paradise y this scientist you do research for , but who does n't actually pay you because you do n't need money . Did I leave anything out ? Julius ignores Vince 's cynicism .
JULIUS: I think it 's important we try to find our fathers .
VINCE: You mean , all those geniuses who contributed to the
JULIUS: Why are you being so immature
VINCE: Do you know how many times I 've heard stories like this ? It 's every orphan 's fantasy 'My real Mom and Dad were rich and eautiful , but there was a mix-up at the hospital and I got switched with another baby But one day there 's going to be a knock at the door and there they 'll be with open arms , crying `` My darling ! My treasure ! We did n't know ! How can we make it up to you ? '' ' I 'm telling you this for your own good , Julius . It 's a crock .
VINCE: I liberated this from my file at the orphanage . Read it and weep . Julius takes the paper and reads aloud .
JULIUS: Dear Sister Anderson , your request for orphans benefits for Vincent Benedict has been denied . According to our files his mothe did not die during birth . We have a current address for her at 172 Canyon Glen Drive , Los Angeles . Vincent 's case seems to be one of simple abandonment and as such he is inelligible for aid .
VINCE: That 's right , Julius , she abandoned me .
VINCE: I do n't know about your momma , Miss Perfect of 1952 , but my momma was a slut , and if she 's still alive , I hope she 's in a lot of pain . She dumped me once no way she gon na get a chance to do it again
JULIUS: Vincent , if they lied to us about Momma for all these years , maybe they lied to her , too . We must find her , we must check this
VINCE: Julius slow down I 've got no
JULIUS: Everyone seems so angry in America .
GARFIELD: The tests on the lower temperature gaskets look great .
LARSON: Looks like an easy weekend .
GARFIELD: Not now .
WEBSTER: I 'm Webster , it 's okay .
GARFIELD: The deal was we were never supposed to meet . You 're supposed to be
WEBSTER: Driving that Cadillac to Texas ? Got my driving gloves , got my driving glasses , got my hat ut no car .
GARFIELD: The car was there ! The merchandise was in the trunk ! Your instructions were on the cassette !
WEBSTER: Let me explain something to you . I have a reputation to uphold . People put their trust in me ecause they know I always delive the goods and I always come back with the money . This whole thing is making me look very bad professionally .
GARFIELD: This is bullshit ! The car was there .
LARSEN: That 's right . The parking attendant thought we were off fo Hawaii .
WEBSTER: The parking attendant ?
GARFIELD: He liked the car . We 'd put on those damn loud shirts so we 'd look like tourists
LARSEN: He asked us if we were going surfing . He was a jerk .
WEBSTER: Guess you 're right . *
GRANGER: Yes ?
JULIUS: I 'm terribly sorry to disturb you party and I realize this might sound strange , but I 'm looking fo someone who lived here a long time ago Mary Anne Benedict .
GRANGER: You 're Mary Anne 's son ?
GIRL: Is n't that you , Grandpa ?
GRANGER: Why do n't you go help your grandma with lunch , honey ?
GRANGER: I guess you could say I 'm you father
JULIUS: One of my fathers
GRANGER: 'Mary Anne Benedict ' I have n't said her name aloud for over 30 years . She was the love of my life . The times I 've wondered what would have happened if I 'd married her
JULIUS: Why did n't you ?
GRANGER: She turned me down . Said she was afraid to have children . She took it real hard when they told he you died . She even stopped painting . Did you know she painted ?
JULIUS: Until yesterday I did n't even know she might still be alive Who told her we died ?
GRANGER: 'We ' ?
JULIUS: I have a twin brother , Vincent .
JULIUS: I 'll go see him .
GRANGER: Watch out for him he 's kind of a dickhead , if you know what I mean .
JULIUS: No , I do n't but I 'm learning .
VINCE: Sorry the car 's been promised for a kid 's charity .
VINCE: Uh Webster calling from California . I happen to have some merchandise you might want
VINCE: I guess twenty seems a little high to you . I 'm a reasonable guy I 'll take fifteen McKINLEY Listen to me , you poor excuse fo a warmed over turd , a deal 's a deal
VINCE: F-five million dollars
AL: Okay His name is Vince Benedict .
WEBSTER: That 's certainly a beginning .
CARLA: I 'm really disappointed in you atting on your best friend .
WEBSTER: My best friend who 's been screwing my wife for three years .
CARLA: You knew ?
AL: All three years .
CARLA: And you never told me until there was a stranger listening ? Shit , what about my reputation ?
WEBSTER: Where can I find Mister Benedict ?

CARLA: I always loved you , Al .

WEBSTER: No one 's gon na believe this one .
VINCE: 'Going back to Houston , Houston , Houston '
JULIUS: Vince , the most amazing thing has happened .
VINCE: You scared the living shit out of me
JULIUS: I met one of our fathers . He told me of a man in New Mexico who probably knows where Momma is .
VINCE: Great .
JULIUS: She did n't abandon you she did n't even know you were born !
VINCE: Awww that 's terrible .
JULIUS: And she was told that I died !
VINCE: Look , Julius , I 'm in kind of a hurry . Sammy wants me to take the car to Houston . Much bigge ucks when you raffle for charity in Houston . Julius takes the map from Vince , looks at it .
JULIUS: New Mexico is on the way to Houston .
VINCE: A lot of places are on the way to Houston . I 'll be back in a few days . Stay in my apartment . Run up my phone bill . Throw wild parties . Take advantage of me .
JULIUS: Vincent , we have to go see this man Traven in New Mexico !
VINCE: No we do n't .
JULIUS: Yes we do ! And I 'm coming with you !
VINCE: You know you 're right . This is fate destiny But there 's no way I 'm gon na drive for 1500 miles with you smelling like that
JULIUS: You 're right I 'll take a showe be right back
VINCE: Why does everybody have to like me so much ?
LINDA: Happy birthday , Vince .
VINCE: Oh please It 's not my birthday anymore
MARNIE: Happy birthday , Vince . Is Julius around ?
LINDA: Where are you going ?
VINCE: Nowhere
LINDA: You were going somewhere you were n't even going to say goodbye
VINCE: Okay , okay look , you ca n't tell anybody this not even you sister but I 'm onto something so huge it gives me a rash just thinking about it .
LINDA: Like what ?
VINCE: I got something in here I do n't even know what it is that 's worth a fortune !
LINDA: A fortune ! That 's great !
NEIGHBOR: Never sleep with that man . Neve loan him money . And never believe a word he tells you that 's free advice . She slams the door shut .
LINDA: Vince ?
VINCE: I borrowed a cup of sugar from her once
LINDA: I 'm coming with you . I 'm not letting you out of my sight .
VINCE: No you 're not .
LINDA: I am because if you say 'no ' one more time I 'll tell everybody you 're hiding a fortune in your
VINCE: Okay , okay . Just do n't let on to Julius . He thinks we 're going to look up our ancestors , like in 'Roots ' or something .
JULIUS: Marnie excuse me I was just taking a shower .
MARNIE: Oh do n't mind me . She turns her back to him . Julius realizes he has no clean shirt .
JULIUS: I hope Vince does n't mind if I orrow one of his shirts .
MARNIE: Just do n't try wearing his pants . They both turn as
JULIUS: That 's a great idea , Vince .
WEBSTER: Your owner seems to be a very popular fellow these days .
WEBSTER: Howdy .
BURT KLANE: Who are you ?
WEBSTER: It 's not really important , is it ? I wanted to feed the cat before I left .
BURT KLANE: I asked you a question . Webster shrugs , exhales .
WEBSTER: Who are you ?
BOB: We 're the Klane brothers . That 's Burt and Morris I 'm Bob .
WEBSTER: Interesting genetic pool . You 're looking for Vince Benedict , right ? The brothers all nod .
BURT KLANE: Hit him , Bob .
WEBSTER: Your brothers seem to have a problem with their feet . It could be contagious .
LINDA: Did Julius like the cookies ? Marnie shrugs .
MARNIE: I 'm not sure he said they 'd provide one hundred percent of the average daily requirement of fourteen source vitamins in a high-fiber form that 's an integral part of a properly alanced diet . Linda looks at her . A beat .
LINDA: I think that 's good .
MARNIE: I really hope so .
VINCE: This ought to fit you .
JULIUS: What ?
VINCE: You allergic to something ?
JULIUS: No . Why ?
VINCE: What are those bumps doing all over your body ? You 're all swelled up . You look like you 're about to explode .
JULIUS: We ca n't all be born beautiful like you , Vince . Some of us
VINCE: Are just born to be bad . It 's you , Julius . Oooh , you are so scary
MARNIE: Julius As he walks past , Julius slaps her five .
JULIUS: Let 's rock and roll . He opens the car door and climbs in .
VINCE: It 's his first T-shirt .
JULIUS: Thank you .
MARNIE: See you later .
VINCE: See if you can get us a room with a king-sized bed , okay ?
JULIUS: That 's not necessary . I always sleep on the floor .
VINCE: Now promise me something .
JULIUS: You still think I 'm making it all up , do n't you ?
VINCE: Well , that 's that . On to Houston .
JULIUS: He 's lying !
VINCE: Keep your voice down . This place
JULIUS: For the first time in my life , I am pissed off !
VINCE: Do n't do this to me . I got a car to deliver . The last thing I need is a detour in the slammer Julius furiously stops and turns around .
JULIUS: I 'm going to make him tell us the truth
VINCE: No
TRAVEN: You turned out just like I thought you would , Vincent . What did you do , escape from prison ? Vince stops dead , shell-shocked .
VINCE: How did you know my name ?
TRAVEN: I named you .
TRAVEN: This room was sealed as soon as your mother gave birth .
TRAVEN: You came out first , of course We were n't expecting him .
VINCE: But instead of just one perfect kid , Mom had two of us way to go , Mom .
TRAVEN: Wrong . The embryo split in two ,
VINCE: Whoa I 'm the crap ?
JULIUS: It 's not true , Vince .
VINCE: No , I want to hear this . I 'm left-over crap ? I 'm no good ?
JULIUS: He 's wrong . Angry tears well up in Vince 's eyes .
TRAVEN: Just look at him
VINCE: You tellin ' me I 'm a side effect ! ? !
TRAVEN: You have n't got the brainpower to understand this Vincent , and I have n't got the time show 's over . He turns to go .
TRAVEN: Whispering Pines it 's an artists colony two hundred miles north of Santa Fe .
JULIUS: If you 're lying to me . I 'll be back . Julius tosses him aside .
VINCE: My life just got flushed down the toilet .
JULIUS: You 're wrong , Vincent . You life 's just about to begin .
VINCE: I 'm genetic garbage . Julius shakes his head .
JULIUS: I know .
VINCE: So how come if we 're the same ,
JULIUS: We had six fathers , Vince . We 're different parts of a lot of different people . Vince is starting to get interested again .
VINCE: Yeah ?
JULIUS: And remember , I was taken to a eautiful island , protected , educated , loved , given every opportunity to grow , to dream , to create . But you had none of that .
JULIUS: You 're the missing part of my life and I 'm the missing part of your life . And when we find our mother we can fill the missing part of hers . We wo n't e alone anymore , Vince . We can be a family . Vince looks at his brother . A beat .
VINCE: A family ? You really think so ?
VINCE: With like Thanksgiving dinner ? And Christmas trees
JULIUS: and a real home where you 'll always be welcome .
VINCE: Always ?
JULIUS: Even when you 've been bad . Vince begins to brighten .
VINCE: I 'm not introducing you to my mother dressed like some goatsherder from Albania . You need some new clothes . A SALES CLERK approaches Vince .
SALES CLERK: Can I help you , sir ?
VINCE: Do I look like I need help ? Here 's the problem . Maybe I 'll try on a couple of things myself .
JULIUS: Do I look okay ?
VINCE: You look better , put it that way . We got to do something about the way you walk . You 're moving a
JULIUS: I read the book .
VINCE: That 's not gon na help . You got to walk like you 're moving in time to music . I 'm not talking about military marches now , I mean Aretha Franklin , Otis Redding , Wilson Pickett , Archie Bell and
JULIUS: We know where to find our momma !
VINCE: Everything Julius said was true . I 'm the product of geniuses !
LINDA: I always knew that .
VINCE: Of course , but it 's nice to make it official .
JULIUS: Tommorrow we 're going to finally meet our mother .
VINCE: And tonight we celebrate !
JULIUS: Vince , you 've got to help me I 've never been out on a date efore what should I do ?
VINCE: Talk to her , buy her some drinks , dance with her . Girls like to dance . Julius looks at his brother .
JULIUS: Dance ?
VINCE: I guess you have n't done that efore either .
VINCE: Well forget all that disco shit , everyone 's seen it . When I eally want to romance a girl , I waltz with her .
VINCE: It turns them to putty in you hands .
JULIUS: Thank you for this , Vince
VINCE: I said put your feet by my feet not on my feet !
JULIUS: Did you know they had beer in ancient Egypt ?
MARNIE: Er no
JULIUS: Actually it was invented by the Assyrians , but the Eygptians were the first people to perfect the malt fermentation process .
LINDA: You sure know a lot about beer .
MARNIE: He knows a lot about everything . Julius polishes off the bottle , belches .
JULIUS: But it 's all from books . Until tonight I never had a beer . All theory , no practice the story of my life !
VINCE: Well , we 're going to change all that are n't we , Marnie ?
JULIUS: Can I ask you a question ?
MARNIE: Anything
JULIUS: Am I shit-faced yet ?
MARNIE: You 're getting there . Vince gets to his feet .
VINCE: Please excuse me my back teeth are floating .
JULIUS: I better see if mine are , too . Julius takes off after Vince .
VINCE: Not all the time . Listen , Marnie 's got the hots fo you . Tonight could be your lucky night
JULIUS: I do n't think she really likes me .
VINCE: Piece of cake . You 're nervous 'cause it 's your first time . Perfectly natural .
JULIUS: Were you nervous ?
VINCE: I was twelve and she was a nun that 's real pressure .
JULIUS: For me , too , Vince ! Sometimes I 'm so happy , I want to pick you up and hug you !
VINCE: Hey , cut it out ! Not in here !
BEETROOT: Lookin ' forward to it .
WEBSTER: I 'd do the same thing . You want the delivery , it 's not you problem who delivers . If you ever need me , my answering service forwards all messages . And he 's gone .
BEETROOT: Put this in my personal file . God , I love a professional
LINDA: Did you tell anybody we were coming to Santa Fe ?
MARNIE: Well , I phoned work and told them we would n't be coming in for a few days Oh , I forgot to tell you we 've been fired .
LINDA: Let 's go to the ladies ' room .
MARNIE: But we just went . Linda takes Marnie by the hand , just as
BURT KLANE: Hello , girls Do you mind if we sit down and enjoy the music with you ?

JULIUS: He 's been getting out of trouble all his life , he 's good at it .
MARNIE: He may need you .
JULIUS: I do n't know much anymore on the island I was smart . Here , I 've only made things worse .
MARNIE: Do n't you realize you could make things a lot worse if you do n't do something .
