DARRELL: It 's your radiator hose . It 's busted .
BOBBY: I know it 's busted . What did I just tell you ?

BOBBY: My name is Bobby . Now I 'm not a strange anymore . See how easy it is for us to get to know each other , beautiful ?
GRACE: Do you have to call me that ?
BOBBY: I do n't know your real name .

BOBBY: No trouble at all , really .
GRACE: Oh , this is n't my car . It 's down a ways . I should have parked closer . I just did n't think it would be so heavy . I could drive up .
BOBBY: That 's all right . I got it .
GRACE: It 's just new drapes and curtain rods . If I had known it was going to be so heavy I would have had them delivered up to the house .
BOBBY: You 're welcome , Grace .
GRACE: You 're not from around here , are you ?
BOBBY: Why you say that ? Just because I help a lady with her package ?
GRACE: You do n't have that dead look in your eyes like the only thing you live for is to get through the day .
BOBBY: I just drove in this morning .
GRACE: Drove into Superior ? What for ?
BOBBY: Did n't have a choice . My car overheated up the road .
GRACE: You 're lucky you did n't break down in the desert . Day like today , you 'd be dead in no time . When you leaving ?
BOBBY: Not until my car 's fixed . I do n't know how long that 's going to take .
GRACE: And here I 've made you all hot and sweaty .
SHERIFF: Morning Grace .

GRACE: A little of this , a little of that . Mostly I tell fortunes .
BOBBY: Where 'd you learn to do that ?
GRACE: From my father . He was the tribe 's shaman .
BOBBY: A medicine man ?
GRACE: Those are white words , not ours .
BOBBY: Nice house for a shaman 's daughter . You must be good .
GRACE: Come here .
BOBBY: My face tell you all that ?
GRACE: It tells me what every face tells me . Everybody has a past , they have a pain , and they have something they want . What is it you want ?

GRACE: Really ? I want to hang drapes .
BOBBY: What ?
GRACE: Lift me down .

GRACE: And what would that be ?
BOBBY: All right , Grace . No more games . GRACE Games ?
GRACE: Really ? And what game did you want to play ? You carry my box for me , and I fall into bed with you ? Bobby grabs up his pack .
BOBBY: I think I can find my own way back to into town .
GRACE: Maybe I like to find out about a man first . Maybe I like to know what he 's made of .
BOBBY: I 'm just flesh and blood , baby . That and a few memories of bad women ; just like most guys . But you already know that . You read my mind , remember ? Thanks for the lemonade . Bobby turns to leave .
GRACE: You never did answer my question .
BOBBY: Still playing ?
GRACE: That 's not an answer . What is it you want ?
BOBBY: You know what I want .
GRACE: Maybe I just want to hear you say it .
JAKE: Who the hell is this ! ?
BOBBY: Who the hell are you ?
JAKE: I 'm her husband . BOBBY Husband ?
BOBBY: Easy , chief . I I was helping your wife . I met her in town . She needed a hand with her drapes . That 's all .

JAKE: A lot that means .

BOBBY: Darrell 's a moron . JAKE Yeah , he sure is a character . You need any help with that car now ? Where you headed ?
JAKE: Live there ?
BOBBY: Got work . I know a man who 's got a boat . Wants me to sail it for him .
JAKE: You a sailor man ? That 'd be the life . Drive across the country , step on a boat and just sail away . A man could pretty well disappear like that . Just sail away until all he was was a memory . I guess a little place like this would just be a dot on a map to you after awhile .
BOBBY: I hope so . Listen , McKenna about your wife If I had known she was married
JAKE: It would n't have made a difference to you , now would it ? Not a wit . Do you know why ? Because you 're a man without scruples .
BOBBY: Wait a second
JAKE: Ah , I can smell it on you .
BOBBY: Hey !
JAKE: That 's the sweat of a man who has n't an honest bone in his body . Do n't be offended , lad . A man who 's got no ethics is a free man . I envy that . Beside , how can I blame you ? That Grace sure has a mind of her own , and a body to match , do n't she ? Eh ? Jake nudges Bobby who smiles a nervous smile .
BOBBY: Ca n't live with them , and you ca n't shoot 'em .
JAKE: `` You ca n't shoot 'em ! '' I like that . I bet she led you on good , did n't she ? Taking you up to the house to hang drapes . Oh that 's a good one . Bet she had you hard as a rock wiggling her ass in you face . I bet you just wanted to pull down her pants and hog her out . Then me busting in like some wild bear . Ha ! Bet you had a fire going under you .
BOBBY: Like you do n't know .
JAKE: Mad like a dog in heat , I bet you were . I can tell you got a temper on you . Bobby gives a little laugh .
BOBBY: Would I what ?
JAKE: Would you kill her ? Bobby starts to laugh . Bobby stops laughing .
BOBBY: I 've done a few things but I 'm not a murderer , Mr. McKenna .
JAKE: How do you know if you 've never tried ?
BOBBY: This is a joke , right ? You just want to attle me . Right ?
JAKE: That 's right . Nothing but a joke . That 's all .

SECOND BIKER: He 's fucking with you man . Shoot him . BIKER he does n't have to give me the bag .
BIKER: A little extra never hurt , Benji , would you just relax .
WOMAN: No ! No ! My wedding ring .
BIKER: Now we go .
WOMAN: You go to El Diablo !
SECOND BIKER: Bugger ! You bitch !

BOBBY: It might as well be fifteen-hundred dollars , because I do n't have the money .
DARRELL: Then you ai n't gon na have the car .
BOBBY: Listen , man . I got rolled half an hour ago for everything I had .
DARRELL: Then you 're only a hundred-forty-five in the hole . You can keep that dollar . Now why do n't you just take your American Express Gold Card , and call that guy with the big schnooz on TV and have him send you the money lickity split .
BOBBY: I do n't have a goddamn credit card .

JAKE: And what does that make you ?
BOBBY: The slimy bastard who 's going to do it fo you You 're a jealous man Jake . If you ca n't have Grace to yourselfwell , you 're not the sharing kind . For a moment Jake stares quietly at Bobby .
JAKE: Well , I guess I have what you call a love-hate relationship with Grace .
BOBBY: You love her , but you hate her ?
JAKE: No , I hate loving her . I hate the kind of person she is . I hate having to tolerate the little `` games '' she plays . Like fucking half of the town behind my back and laughing at me . The bitch . She loved to play . She wants me to hit her and when I hit her she likes it . She tortures me . But she 's family . She 's my little girl . My aby . I could n't stand to watch her eyes oll back in her head as she sucks her last eath , or to see her pretty pink brains spill from her skull . No . Not me . But you ? You got the killing in you , boyHow much you want ? A pause .
BOBBY: Make it twenty . JAKE Twenty-thousand ? I do n't have that kind of money . I wo n't get the insurance until months after she 's dead . I do n't imagine you 'll want to be stickin ' around afte poor Grace 's demise . Twenty-thousand ; that 's more money than I could ever get my hands on .
JAKE: Maybe ten-thousand . And that 's a maybe .
BOBBY: I need thirteen .
JAKE: That 's a bit much .
BOBBY: We 're not talking about buying a car Jake . We 're talking about killing your wife . It 's thirteen , or it 's nothing .
JAKE: You drive a hard bargain , but I had a feeling you were my boy when I met you .
BOBBY: I 'm not your boy . I do n't like you . I got no choice but to do business with you . Let 's just call this a nasty little marriage of convenience .
JAKE: Do n't say that . I had a marriage of convenience with Grace , and look where that 's lead Well , looks like we got ourselves a contract . BOBBY Do we shake hands ?
BOBBY: How do you want it ?
JAKE: How the hell should I know ? I 've never had a wife killed before . Jesus Christ ! You < /u want this job , you do n't know how to do this ? I guess I should have hired a professional .
BOBBY: You want to do this yourself ? I do n't have to do this , you know .
JAKE: Be quiet , boy . I got to figure this thing . I 'm thinking . It ca n't be done at the house . It should be Jake walks the office thinking .
BOBBY: Come to think of it , how 'bout some money upfront ?
JAKE: Oh yeah sure . Why do n't I buy you a plane ticket right out of here while I 'm at it . I u > know you This is what you do Go to the house to see her .
BOBBY: And tell her what ?
GRACE: How do you know he 's still not here ?
BOBBY: Guys like me take those chances . Let 's go .
GRACE: They hear you comin ' . They wo n't bothe you . Just do n't sneak up on 'em .
BOBBY: Does n't the isolation bother you ?
GRACE: Yeah , but I like the sun . I grew up on a eservation . The sun , the desert ; they like a religion to us . Jake 's the same way . He loves the desert . I guess we 're alike that way . That 's about the only way .
BOBBY: You love him ?
GRACE: No .
BOBBY: Did you ever ?
GRACE: Depends on what you call love . I grew up on a reservation . A patch of desert in the middle of nowhere . That 's where they stick Indians , Bobby . That 's where they leave us to die . My brother killed himself when he was 19 cause he could n't take it anymore . There 's no hope there Jake was my ticket out . Mom and me .
BOBBY: Is that why you 're with him ?
GRACE: I let him think he was courtin ' me , but I eeled him in like a fish on a line . I wanted him . I wanted what he could give me , and I would 've done anything to get him . Is that love ?
BOBBY: I 'm guessing no .
GRACE: Yeah , I guess you 're right .
BOBBY: I take it things did n't much work out the way you planned .
GRACE: I 'm still here , are n't I ? See this ?
GRACE CONT: All this nothing ? It does n't get to Jake like it gets to me . He says he do n't mind eing nothing but a big fish in a small pond . More like a little fish in a dried up watering hole .
BOBBY: You could leave him .
GRACE: I do n't know how .
BOBBY: Walk away .
GRACE: It 's not that easy . Maybe you can take chances ; maybe you can wander around like some stray wherever you please . I ca n't . I do n't want to be alone . I need to know I 'm going to be taken care of .
BOBBY: You need a meal ticket is what you mean . Some guy you can latch onto just long enough for him to get you out of here .
GRACE: Is that so bad ? It 's not like I would n't try to make him happy . For awhile , anyway . I mean , I would do things for him . I guess I 'm no good that way . I guess I tried to sucker you along like that . Do you hate me for it ? I would n't blame you if you did . But maybe it 's like you said You just got to do whatever it takes to get out . BOBBY Whatever it takes . Grace steps to the edge of the plateau .
GRACE CONT: If I was a bird I would fly to Florida ; to Disney World . I always wanted to go there . I 'd fly to New York . Maybe . I guess New York is n't the best place to be a bird . I 'd fly to St. Louis , then New Orleans , all over Texas . Then I 'd fly to California . I guess by then I 'd have seen it all and I could die .
GRACE: Hate 's a funny thing . Right now I bet you do n't know if you want to kill me , or fuck me .
BOBBY: What 's the matter ? Grace ?
GRACE: Nothing .
BOBBY: Do n't feel like nothing .
GRACE: Get out of town , Bobby , as quick as you can .
BOBBY: Grace , I 've been fucked over too many times , by too many women . You 're becoming the queen of hot and cold .
GRACE: You 'd never understand .
BOBBY: Try me .
GRACE: It 's just such a mess . With Jake I mean
BOBBY: Nothing I understand better than a mess . GRACE Jake was with my Mom after my real Dad died .
GRACE: He was a Shamanin the mine . We had nothin ' after he died . Jake took us in , gave us a little money . He used to call me his `` little halfbreed '' He kept Mom on the side y'know , cause he was married someplace else . He had kids in Phoenix I think , no one knew him around herebut the thing wasyou see he was raping me the whole timefo years . He loved to do things to me . Believe it or not , he used to say he was in love with my ass . Y'ever been in love with a woman 's ass ? The dominoes are tumbling for Bobby .
BOBBY: Yeah .
GRACE: You 're sick toohe loved to do things to me . Control me . My Momit tore her up cause she could n't do nothing about it . She ecome alcoholicand the funny thing is I liked it . I liked being controlled by Jake . The truth was as far out and crazy as
BOBBY: I 'm sorry
GRACE: Yeah . What do you want . Life , right ? Have you ever been to California ?
BOBBY: Yeah . GRACE Is it far from here ?
GRACE: Is it pretty ?
BOBBY: Oh yeah . It 's beautiful , beautiful beaches . Blue water and clear skies as far as you can see . GRACE Would you take me with you ? BOBBY I wish I could .
GRACE: Please . I wo n't hang on you . As soon as we get there you can dump me . I do n't care . I just want to get out of here .
GRACE: Darrell ? You know he and Jake are
BOBBY: You do n't have any money put away , do you ?
GRACE: Jake never gives me more ' n twenty bucks at a time , like a bird in a cage , he do n't want me goin ' anywhere
BOBBY: you could get me money . I 'll get you out of here . She looks at him .
GRACE: There 's money . A lot . The words hang there , thick between them .
BOBBY: Where ?
GRACE: Jake hides it . In a safe . In the floor . In the bedroom . He counts it . He loves to sit there and count it .
BOBBY: What do you mean ?
GRACE: At night . He just sits there and laughs and talks to himself and counts it . I heard him . My Mom told me he had a hunnert thousand dollars down there . Maybe more . Bobby 's eyes widen in hope .
BOBBY: In cash ?
GRACE: Oh yeah . There 's nothing else with Jake . He do n't trust banks . He keeps the money in the floor right under the bed . He loves it so much , he would n't think of spending any of it on me . I never seen it but I know he 's got more than a hunnert thousand at least
BOBBY: One-hundred-thousand ! ? That son-of-a-bitch . GRACE What do you mean ? BOBBY If it 's in a safe we 'd have to get the combination
GRACE: It takes a key . He keeps it on himself all the time . I mean all the time . It scratches up against me when we do it .
BOBBY: If the key 's on him , how do we get the key ?
GRACE: Kill him .
BOBBY: I ca n't kill , Grace . I ca n't kill anybody .
GRACE: It 's not like he 's a young man , Bobby . He 's had time to live . It 'd be quick . I mean , he would n't even have to feel it I mean , sometime in the middle of the night , when it 's quietwhen he 's asleep , you could just come up behind him when he 's pounding on me and
BOBBY: Shit ! Listen to you Are you crazy , Grace ? He abruptly pulls away .
GRACE: But it 's in you , Bobby . I see it . I see Death . It 's in your heart . Let it out fo me . Let it out He 's mesmerized . Then
BOBBY: Itake me back to town
GRACE: You need the money , Bobby . It 's a lot more than $ 100,000 . A lot more . How are you going to get out of here ? You need the money . Whatever it takes , Bobby , remember ?
BOBBY: No ! The screen burns a bright white .
BLIND MAN: It 's the desert that makes you crazy . The loneliness out here . Nobody to talk to . People on the run . Trailer parks . White trash . I seen some peculiar things on a hot day . I seen a scorpion sting itself to death . It just keeps driving its tail into its body again and again . A little kille killing itself . Seen a coyote kill itself too . Just kept on biting and tearing at its own legs . Near tore one clean off efore it bled to death . And what a white man 'll do when it 's freezing one moment , hot as hell the next . A man could get hisself killed just for rubbing shoulders with another kiss kissy kiss . Nice pussy y'see , see it coming . I do n't know what it is about the desert . I figger it 's sort of like putting a kettle of water over a fire . People is mostly water . We boil when it 's hot . 'Cept when we boil the water 's got no place to go . It just churns inside of us until we can cool off . If it 's not too late .
BOBBY: You sure seen a lot for a blind man .
BLIND MAN: Just 'cause I ai n't got eyes does n't mean I ca n't see .
BOBBY: That a fact ?
BLIND MAN: I can see just fine . For example You 're a young man who thinks he 's got someplace to be . A POLICE RADIO crackles , Bobby tensing .
BOBBY: Maybe I do .
BLIND MAN: Or maybe you just think you do . Just another small town . One guy chasing you . You go big town . Just gon na have four guys after you instead . Kiss kissy kiss . It gets down to one thing are you a human being or are you one of those hungry ghosts out there never satisfied with nothing ? Cause you got ta remember you can run just as fa as you can , but wherever you go , that 's where you gon na be .
BOBBY: I think I 've heard that before .
BLIND MAN: What do you want for free ?
BOBBY: You sure got a lot of philosophy , old man .
BLIND MAN: Seems like I do but only cause end of the day we 're all eyes in the same head . And everything is everything .
BOBBY: What ?
BLIND MAN: And everything is nothing too . BOBBY Maybe one day I 'll get to sit on a corne and spout wise .
BOBBY: Who 's cursed ?
BLIND MAN: All them miners last century . Hungry ghosts , killed off all the Indians . Up at the mine . Earth ran red with blood , think I 'm fooling around here . White sky was on fire . Grown men cried like babies . I saw a flash , then darkness descended upon me . They put me in the joint . Took my eyes . I cursed them . White people ca n't seem to stay away from Indians . You got ta watch where ya put your fingers . Pussy pussy pussy , Indian pussy .
BOBBY: I thought you said you lost your eyes in the war ?
BLIND MAN: So now you 're going to tell me where I lost my eyes . You do n't think I know where I lost my eyes ? I was there when I lost them . I lost them in the war . The war in the joint . There 's always wars in the joint . Cause I was a code talker in the joint and in the war too . Mmmm , nothing like the smell of a naked lady . Be careful , boy .
BOBBY: Musta been some bad ass nuclear tests here in the 50 's . This town 's all inbreeding .
BLIND MAN: Well , people got ta get by somehow . That 's the curse . The mines done it . All that uranium , plutonium , fuffonium , fuckononium , assononium , all that `` om '' ! Everybody 's got a mother . You do n't rip up your mother . You do n't rip up the Earth and take everything out . It 's like the Cracker Jack box says , `` the more you eat , the more you want . ''
BOBBY: I got things to do . BLIND MAN Oh well , go do 'em . You do n't see me stopping you
BLIND MAN: But ai n't you got a little something fo the infirm ?
BOBBY: I 'm a little short Pops . I 'll catch you next time .

JAKE: What the hell you looking at , girl ?

BLIND MAN: Well , that 's it . Sun 's going down . People go home , trade stories over dinner . They 'll talk about the day , about the heat , laugh about something crazy it made them do . They 'll kiss , sleep a few hours , then do it all over again .
BOBBY: The day was n't so bad . We all got through it all right . BLIND MAN Keep it .
BLIND MAN: Night is when you want to sleep , but the dry heat keeps you tossin ' and turnin ' . It 's when you wish the sun was bakin ' high in the sky so you could see what it is you 're afraid of .
BOBBY: You afraid of the dark ?
BLIND MAN: Afraid of it ? Boy , I live in the dark . All cause of a woman who made me this way . People are afraid of what they ca n't see . I ca n't see nuthin ' , so it 's all the same to me . Kiss from a beautiful woman , kissy kissy kiss , a lick from a dog , slurp , slurp , the kiss of death . It 's all the same to me .
BOBBY: So , we 're all just floating along like twigs in a stream , so enjoy the ride . Is that it ?

BLIND MAN: Well , do n't say I did n't warn you when things go your way .

BLIND MAN: Used to be a young smartass like you . Then I got smart with the wrong man 's daughter . Got some acid poured on my peepers for my trouble . You know human beings ai n't always just human they got animals living inside 'em tooPeople give spare change to war heroes not fools . All fools get is pity . May not have eyes , but I see . And you , boy ? The Blind Man puts his glasses back on .
BOBBY: Time 's up . Any last words of wisdom ?
BLIND MAN: Things ai n't always the way they seem . You got to ask yourself is it worth it ? Day comes Earthmaker is going to look in you fucking heart ! Then you better know what it

JAKE: I like Darrell . He may be an idiot , but he 's my half brother . We own Harlin 's together , yeah , that little redneck manages to get paid no matter how things work out . BOBBY You been workin ' me the whole time .
BOBBY: It 's not what you think , Jake .
JAKE: No , but it do n't matter anyway when you 're lying there with your brains all over my carpet and I 'm telling Sheriff Potter about this drifter , did n't have enough money to fix his car . And Darrell happened to find his gun , and through maybe this drifte heard old Jake got some money stashed away , and figgered he might try to break in and steal it !
BOBBY: Wait a minute . Just listen to me
JAKE: And he thought he 'd clock old Jake McKenna and turn his brains into wall paperand then maybe borrow $ 200 o $ 20,000 , or $ 200,000 BOBBY That 's not the reason I 'm here , Jake .
BOBBY: Maybe I do n't like being played , like she played us today . Maybe I do n't like that at all , Jake . I 'm just pissed enough , maybe I 'll rip the neck off my own grandmother .
JAKE: You have a lot of talk in you , whole lot of talk .
BOBBY: Damn it , Jake . There is a guy coming to kill me , and if it comes down to me o Grace , then I pick Grace . You were going to give me thirteen-thousand . Give me two-hundred . I 'll kill her and dump the ody where no one will ever find it . She showed me the perfect place . There wo n't be enough left for an autopsy . But I need the the money . I 've got to have the money .
JAKE: She 's in the bedroom .
BOBBY: Wan na give me my gun ?
JAKE: A strangling 'll do just fine . Go to work .
BOBBY: How 'bout the pipe ? JAKE She 's got a slender neck .
JAKE: Hold on a second ! Come here !
BOBBY: What are you talking about ! JAKE This morning when I came in on you and Grace , you swore you had n't been near the edroom . Now you make straight for it .
JAKE: Or did you just ply the afternoon away etween my sheets putting your lips all over her , you little horndog BOBBY What difference does it make if I slept with her ? We 're gon na kill her .
BOBBY: O.K. ! I admit it ! I fucked her ! But it 's
JAKE: You 'd tell me anything to save you pathetic life .
BOBBY: You know what kind of woman Grace is , Jake . You know how badly she wants to get the fuck out of Superior . What 's she to you , Jake ; a woman who wants you dead ? Let me kill her . All I want is two-hundred dollars to get out of here with .
JAKE: Two-hundred dollars ?
BOBBY: Two-hundred dollarsI 'll do it ! I 'll kill her !
JAKE: Sweet Christ , I 'd be doing the world a favor , ridding it of the likes of you . Get your miserable ass off the floor . You 're positively pathetic Go on , go kill Grace . Bobby slowly stands .
GRACE: Jake !
JAKE: Grace ! !
BOBBY: Grace , goddamit , do something !
JAKE: Grace ?
GRACE: Like you helped her , Jake ?
BOBBY: What the hell 'd you wait for ?
GRACE: The money 's right here ! Get the key !
BOBBY: No ! You get it !
GRACE: Did n't I tell you ? BOBBY There must be 150 , 200 thousand here ! Goddamnit Grace , you were right !
BOBBY: Open up !
DARRELL: What the hell oh , it 's you . Might 've figgered . Listen I got a waitress coming over . What do you want ?
BOBBY: I want my car .
DARRELL: You got the money ?
BOBBY: That 's none of your business . Get the keys .
DARRELL: I do n't want no dirty money . I run an honest business .
DARRELL: No .
GRACE: Bobby ? What the hell 's the matter with you ?
BOBBY: I nothing . I just stubbed my toe on a rock . Hurt like hell .
GRACE: I got the money all packed . I put the jeep and his caddy in the garage . People 'll think maybe me and Jake went away . Buy us some timeI know a back road we can take .
BOBBY: Good thinking . What 's all this ?
GRACE: I 'm not coming back . BOBBY Awright , let 's go . I want to be fifty miles from here before the sun comes up .
BOBBY: I ca n't see it .
GRACE: It should be just up ahead . Hold on there ! There it is !
BOBBY: Hey ! Take it easy . Want to get us killed ?
GRACE: You do n't know what it feels like to be free of that place .
BOBBY: I do n't know about that ?
GRACE: You spent a day in Superior . I wasted my entire life there . I feel like someone just took a million pounds off my shoulders .
GRACE: Ca n't we just dump him fast someplace ?
BOBBY: I want a place where only the vultures will find him It 'll be over soon , Grace .
GRACE: Then will you take me on your friends ' boat with you ?
BOBBY: I 'm not sailing his boat .
GRACE: But I thought
BOBBY: We 're going to buy a boat of our own baby , and sail it wherever we want to go .
GRACE: Anywhere ?
BOBBY: What the hell ? Why not ? Where should we go ?
GRACE: Hawaii . I 've read all about it . I 've dreamed of going there and just lying on the beach while the water licked up against my feet . Oh , God . I 'd kill to go there .
BOBBY: You already have . She gives him a funny look .
GRACE: What are you talking about ? BOBBY When I got back from the garage , and you jeep was n't there , I thought you 'd gone and left me and taken the money . Cause I never had any luck with women , Grace . You do n't know what I been through . The shit I 've taken . I thought you were like the rest of 'em but when you came out of the house well you 're here Grace and we might be starting in the shit but we 're starting where I never been
BOBBY: We 're gon na pull this off , Grace .
GRACE: Oh , my God ! Do n't stop !
BOBBY: He must 've seen us swerving on the road , that 's all , just gon na give us a ticket fo swerving
GRACE: Keep going ! She seems to be panicking . Bobby pulls over .
BOBBY: Fuck this ! Just shut up , Grace . We done nothing ! Be cool . Let me do the talking . He does n't know anything .
SHERIFF: You had to fuck him , did n't you ! GRACE I would never do that to you , baby He killed Jake said he 'd kill me if I did n't come with him . All he wants is the money .
BOBBY: What ! SHERIFF u > Do n't lie to me ! Grace knows the jam is up .
GRACE: OKbut he never made me cum ! Really Virgil , I was only doing what I had to do so we could be free . Just like we talked about . It meant nothing .
BOBBY: You fucking him too Grace ? Is everybody fucking everybody in this town ?
SHERIFF: You fuck this guy get him to do you dirty work and you think you can take the money and dump me ?
GRACE: No baby , you got it wrong .
SHERIFF: This road do n't go to Globe , Grace where were you going to meet me ?
GRACE: It 's not like that it Look , Virgil , I got the money here .
SHERIFF: This is some girl you and me got here Bobby , yessir , an excellent cocksuck too , would n't you say ? Course you had a lotta practice have n't you darling , going way back to your crazy mama ! GRACE Shut up , Virgil ! Take your share of the money . It 's not so bad .

SHERIFF: Shut up , boy ! You do n't know shit round here ! Get back . Did she tell you that story about the bird flying away ? BOBBY Ow ! Look , I ow !
GRACE: Stop ! Stop it ! SHERIFF Were you going to help her fly away , asshole ? What 'd you think , you were the first boy to drift through this town she came on to ? She tell you the story about old Jake forcing her to marry him ? That 's a good story How he killed her crazy Mama ?
GRACE: Noyou ! You !
BOBBY: Grace . No !
GRACE: Help me get him off the road . Into the car ! We 'll ditch his car Get the fuck up ! Bobby stares at her .
BOBBY: He was in love with you Grace . He would 've done what you wanted , you could 've made a deal and
GRACE: The only deal he had in mind was killing you for Jake 's murder and blackmailing me into sucking his dick for the rest of my life no thanks .
BOBBY: He was a cop , Grace , they never stop looking for you when you kill a cop
BOBBY: Ask you what ? You mean what kind of horrifying sick shit is coming next ?
GRACE: Do n't you want to know ? I bet it 's urning a hole in your brain just now ?
BOBBY: Let it go , baby . It 's the past . I got a past
GRACE: Do n't you really want to know ? Was Jake my Daddy ? Was I fucking my own Daddy ? Do n't you want to know that ? BOBBY What do you want me to say ! She 's yelling , emotionally out of control .
BOBBY: Why ?
GRACE: I do n't know why ! She drops back in her seat . Tears come .
BOBBY: And us Grace ? What do we deserve ? GRACE `` Nin chonk , nin chonk , '' my Mama used to say in Apache . `` Your worst is doing this to you , '' she said , `` your worst has killed you . '' And `` Be go tsee '' `` you will find out the result of what you have done '' Just when you think it 's over , when you 've gotten away , it begins . Cause you never get away .
GRACE: It 's easy to judge someone else when you do n't know nothing about it I 'm Apache , Bobby . You do n't eat what I eat . You do n't see what I see . Do n't judge me .
BOBBY: I do n't want to think anymore . GRACE Then drive
GRACE: See ya , Virgil . God bless .
BOBBY: No Grace , my hand 's bothering me .
GRACE: You think now that Jake 's dead , there 's all that money there and I do n't need you anymore , and I might just sneak up behind you sometime andpop !
BOBBY: You could give me my gun back . Grace smiles .
GRACE: Why do n't we just finish what we started .
BOBBY: I think nothing happens . You 're dead meat . That 's it .
GRACE: You do n't believe in anything do you , Bobby ?
BOBBY: I believe in this moment , that 's all . There is nothing else . Come on . He must weigh 300 pounds .
GRACE: You hit me , Bobby ? You hit a woman , you motherfucker ! Did n't your Momma ever teach you anything ?
BOBBY: Well , nothing . We dump Jake , we split the money , then you 're on your own .
GRACE: Do n't leave me . I want to say with you , Bobby .
BOBBY: Why ? So when the cops catch up with us you can sell me out again ?
GRACE: I was just baiting him ! Bobby , I had to tell him that to get his guard down . Just like you told Jake you was going to kill me !
BOBBY: You lied to me all along ! Lies , all lies . Your mother , your father , what story are you on now ? How come the town did n't know you was his daughter ? GRACE Cause my Mom slept around . A lotta men ! Anybody could 've been my father . But weknew . BOBBY Well you got what you wanted all along by fucking me . I wish you had told me the goddamn truth in the first place ! GRACE
GRACE: I do n't want to go to Mexico , Bobby ! Please , I really want to be with you . Do n't low this . Do n't you think I care about you ?
BOBBY: I think you 're a lying , back-stabbing psycho bitch , and one day you 'll kill me . But it 's nice to know you cared
GRACE: You do n't know your own mind . It blocks your heart .
BOBBY: Give me a hand .
GRACE: My mother died in this canyon .
BOBBY: Save the Mom routine , will ya Grace . It does n't work with me . One , two , three
GRACE: Hope is a four-letter word .
BOBBY: But we all need that too . Hold him .
GRACE: Shit ! She sits there . Bobby is calling from below .
BOBBY: Grace ! Help me , Grace ! We been through too much together . We 've only had one day , ut you and me have been through more than most people ever will . I know you were angry at me , and , you know , you were right ! I 'm sorry I hit you . I was wrong about leaving you . You do n't belong in Mexico .
GRACE: Bobby ? Are you all right ?
BOBBY: I busted my leg !
GRACE: Can you make it back up ?
BOBBY: Grace in the trunk of my car is a tow ope . It should reach down here . Go get it , throw it down .
GRACE: Bobby , the trunkit 's locked . Throw the keys up to me . I 'll get the rope .
BOBBY: I ca n't throw that far . You got to clim down here and get the keys . You can make it . It 's the only way Grace .
GRACE: Okay . I 'm coming . Calm down !
BOBBY: 'Cause I love you . Inching closer .
GRACE: And I love you too .
BOBBY: And love 's a funny thing . Sometimes I do n't know if I want to love you
GRACE: Jake
BOBBY: He ca n't help you now , honey !
ABBY: Morning , Freddy .
SECURITY GUARD: Morning , Abby . Another peaceful day ?
ABBY: If you say so
JOY: We 've got problems .
ABBY: There are no problems , Joy . Only solutions .
JOY: The sky-cam on the traffic copte has a cracked lens and they ca n't fix it .
ABBY: Okay , that 's a problem . Call Matt Hardwick down at Media Services . He 's got a few Sky Cams and he owes me . Now , where are my weathermen ? Joy opens a door to a waiting area .
LATINO MEN: Hey there !
ABBY: Hi , guys ! Abby waves back and closes the door .
ABBY: What 's with the pot bellies ?
JOY: Research shows people like fat weathermen . It makes them feel safe .
ABBY: I like the one in the green and the one in the brown , but I want to see the one in the green with less sideburns and the one in the brown with more , then I 'll make my decision .
LARRY: I 'm sorry to do this to you , Abby , ut I do n't think I can work with her anymore . It 's bad enough I have to take her criticism at home . I ca n't do it on air , too . A man can only take so much .
ABBY: You 're not a man , Larry You 're a newsman . A newsman is n't defined by the easy times , Larry , he 's defined by the difficult ones . Can you imagine Ted Koppel or Chris Hansen or Anderson Cooper having their wives as co-anchor ? Hell , no , ecause they could n't handle it . But you can . You 've got balls the size of Volkswagens . Do n't think I have n't noticed .
LARRY: I 've only thought of them as blue as of late , but you 're right . They are quite sizeable . But not disproportionately so . I like to think of them as aesthetically pleasing
ABBY: I think I 've made my point .
JOSH: Oh , but full coverage on David Beckham 's new tattoo is vital ? !
GEORGIA: He 's trying to kill me ! He knows I ca n't eat crab , I 'm allergic to it ! Does anyone see this ? Is this a hive ?
JOSH: It looks like syphilis to me .
DORI: See that ? You would n't even know what syphilis looks like if it were n't for my story on Paris Hilton .
GUEST CHEF: She does n't eat crab or beef o fish . She does n't eat anything but chicken . You do n't need a chef on this show . You need a box of McNuggets .
GEORGIA: I have to tell you , Bruce . This is the best Chicken Kiev I 've eve tasted .
GUEST CHEF: Actually it 's Duck Kiev . Duck makes an excellent alternative fo chicken , Georgia .
JAVIER: Can I take home the leftovers ? They all laugh .
LARRY: When we return , our live Skycam traffic update and more on David Beckham 's hundred thousand dolla tattoo .
GEORGIA: And what you can do to help preserve the ancient forests of Alaska and how it might help your Albuquerque electric bill .
CLIFF: Go to commercial . I do n't know how you do it .
ABBY: It 's just a matter of staring the chaos in the eye and showing it who 's boss . Nice work , guys .
JOY: Stuart wants to see you . He 's freaking out .
ABBY: That means he got the numbers .
STUART: Have you seen the ratings fo yesterday ? We got beat by all the network shows , plus a rerun of `` Who 's the Boss '' . The one where the vacuum breaks .
ABBY: It 's a temporary setback . This week we 'll do better .
STUART: The guy with the cable access show on Channel 83 does better . If we programed Jerry Springer re-runs , we 'd do a nine share at a quarte the price . Abby looks worried .
ABBY: Please tell me you 're not thinking of killing the show .
STUART: I 'm not , but I can guarantee you that 's what the new management 's thinking .
STUART: Management does n't listen to awards . It listens to numbers . We 're not a family-run station anymore , Abby . You 're good at what you do , but you 've got to get me some numbers . I 've got two daughters in college and a son in eauty school . I do n't know how much you know about Vidal Sassoon ut that shit ai n't cheap . Abby nods .
ABBY: You can count on me , Stuart .
JOY: Absolutely not . You should be out , observing humanity . Humanity 's who watches our show .
ABBY: Yeah , all 2.47 % of them .
JOY: You 've already rescheduled on this guy three times . You cancel tonight and he 's gone . He 's read more than a dozen books , he has a 401K and he 's cute .
ABBY: You printed his profile ?
JOY: What ? I 'm married . I live vicariously through your dating life . And I really think that this could be our next boyfriend . C'mon , he had nine out of ten items on your checklist .
ABBY: Well , technically eight and a half . He said he could cook , but when I pressed him , he was completely unfamiliar with cumin . Do n't you think that 's a little suspicious ? Off Joy 's look , we CUT TO
ABBY: Jim hey . Hi . Hey .
HOSTESS: Shall I show you to your table ?
ABBY: You know what ? This is not the best angle . We should get the table ove there . Then we both get a view , instead of one of us looking at the usboy station .
JIM: I 'm fine here .
ABBY: No , trust me . It 'll be better ove there .
WAITER: Can I get you some water for the table ?
JIM: Bottle of flat , please .
ABBY: You know , they 've done studies that show tap water is no different from ottled water . And they passed a law recently to have all estaurants filter their tap water . So , technically it 's not tap water .
JIM: Yeah , I still like the way it tastes better .
WAITER: Can I get you any cocktails ?
JIM: Scotch on the rocks .
ABBY: In your profile , you said you liked ed wine .
JIM: I do , I just feel like having a scotch right now .
ABBY: Was there anything else you changed your mind about ? I mean , just so I can figure it into the overall picture .
JIM: You printed out my profile ?
ABBY: Actually , my associate produce did . She likes me to be prepared . Not that I 'm ever not prepared . Kudos on your comprehensive ca insurance policy , by the way .
JIM: That was n't in my profile .
ABBY: No , but it was in your background check . Sotell me about yourself .
JIM: Well , what 's left that you do n't know ?
ABBY: Good point .
JIM: I take it it 's happened before ?
ABBY: No , but since you have nine out of ten of the necessary attributes on my checklist , I just wanted to make sure this goes as smoothly as possible .
JIM: Thank you .
ABBY: You realize the ice in that scotch is made from tap water , do n't you ?
ABBY: FYI , be sure to eat this by tomorrow . With curry , you ca n't smell if it 's gone bad , so afte three days , you should just toss it . Really , do n't even give it to a pet or anything .
JIM: Three days . Got it .
ABBY: Here , just to be sure , I 'll write today 's date on it for you .
JIM: It 's fine , really
ABBY: I told them to double bag this !
JIM: I 'm just gon na go .
ABBY: I 'm so sor
ABBY: Do n't ask .
MIKE: You want the truth ! But you ca n't handle the truth . ` Cause it 's
MOTLEY GROUP: Ugly !
MIKE: I 'm Mike Alexander and we 're back with the `` The Ugly Truth . '' Tonight , as always , we 're going to talk about what it is men and women eally want in relationships . I 've een looking through some books
ABBY: Oh my God . It 's that cable access jackass Stuart was talking about .
MIKE: What 's your boyfriend 's name , princess ?
MIKE: My point exactly , Shrek . Next caller .
ABBY: So you 're saying men are incapable of love ?
MIKE: Did I burst your little Harlequin Romance bubble ?
ABBY: The only thing you burst is you credibility . Men are absolutely capable of experiencing love .
MIKE: Okay , I 'll bite . Who 's the guy ?
ABBY: What ?
MIKE: The guy , Mr . Wonderful , the one who 's so capable of love . Who is he ? What 's he like ?
ABBY: Well , he 's not like you , that 's fo sure .
MIKE: Thank you very much . Go on .
ABBY: He 's smarthe 's handsome but does n't know it He 's successful , but in a job that means something . He loves red wine , classical music , Cary Grant movies
MIKE: This is a guy in America , right ? You 're not calling from Europe o anything .
ABBY: Are you interested in listening o not ?
MIKE: No , please . I 'm loving this .
ABBY: He works out , not because he 's vain , because it 's healthy . He 's socially liberal but fiscally conservative . He likes dogs but he 's a cat person . He never gets out of bed before you on a Sunday morning
MIKE: Oh my god . You 're a lesbian !
ABBY: What ? !
MIKE: Well , you 're describing a woman .
ABBY: Why are those qualities so threatening to you ? Perhaps because your complete lack of any one of them is the real reason why women are n't interested in you . At least women of quality .
MIKE: Where is this guy ? I will give you one hundred dollars of my own money to bring him down here and let me meet him .
ABBY: Oh , he 's out theresomewhere .
MIKE: Wait a second . You 're not even dating this guy ? !
ABBY: Well , noI 'm just describing a typeI thought that 's what we were doing .
MIKE: You do n't even know him ? ! ?
ABBY: Excuse me ?
MIKE: You heard me . You must be . If you were hot , you 'd be out breaking some poor schmuck 's heart instead of spending all your time fantasizing about Mr . Wonderful . Face it , you 're ugly !
ABBY: I am not ugly !
MIKE: Well , of course you do n't think so . Ugly people never know they 're ugly . It 's like people who have B.O . They never know it because they 're surrounded by their own stench all the time .
ABBY: That is the most ridic
MIKE: Look , lem me help you out here . You might as well just face the fact that you 're gon na be alone and stop pining away for some fantasy guy you 're never going to get . Get a hobby . Build housing for the poor . Anything .
ABBY: How could you possibly
MIKE: Hey , Lassie the show 's called `` The Ugly Truth '' . If you ca n't face it , do n't call . Well that about wraps it up fo today . I 'm Mike Alexander reminding you that the truth is never pretty .
JOY: How did the date go ?
ABBY: I ended up pantsless in a parking lot .
JOY: That 's awesome !
STUART: Morning , everybody . He puts a DVD in the player .
JOY: Is that you ?
ABBY: What ? ! No !
STUART: One word . Ratings . Say hello to ou new guest commentator . I 'm starting him with two segments a week . Three minutes a pop .
ABBY: Are you kidding me ?
JOSH: Who the hell is this guy ?
STUART: His name is Mike Alexander .
ABBY: And he 's a quintessential misogynist uber-moron who epresents everything wrong with television and society at large
DORI: I get crap every time I suggest we do something even remotely fluffy and now you 're gon na put this douchebag on the air ?
STUART: He 's got a point of view . We do n't have to like him , we 're news people . We 're objective . Stone Phillips interviews terrorists , does n't mean he likes them . It 's good for ratings . Abby holds up a piece of paper .
ABBY: I 've got a whole list of ideas on how to improve ratings . We do n't need him . Stuart takes the memo , reading it .
STUART: A live debate on immigration policy ? Never work .
ABBY: What are you talking about ? Albuquerque is 45 % Latino .
MIKE: Yeah , and as you can tell by all the screaming rugrats in this town , Latino guys like to have a lot of sex . Which means they 'd rathe listen to me tell them how to bang hot chicks than hear about why they ca n't bring grandma across the order .
STUART: See , what did I tell you ? He 's great .
MIKE: Thanks , boss . Abby spins to face Stuart .
ABBY: You already hired him ? !
MIKE: Who 's this delightful creature ?
ABBY: Your superior .
MIKE: MmmI like a woman on top .
ABBY: I am an award-winning news producer . I am an award-winning news producer
MIKE: Hey , no hard feelings , right ?
ABBY: You do n't even knock ?
MIKE: I knocked . I got no response .
ABBY: So , essentially your knock was negated by your complete lack of adherence to the social etiquette of what follows a knock .
MIKE: Wow . You are wound like a fuckin ' top . Abby glares at him .
ABBY: Woof woof . Recognize the bark ? He stares at her , surprised .
MIKE: Hey , what do you know ? You 're not ugly at all .
ABBY: Imagine my relief .
MIKE: You know , if it were n't for you , I would have never gotten this gig . You and I make good TV .
ABBY: I 'm sorry , what channel is you show on ?
MIKE: Eighty three .
ABBY: This is channel two . You do know that the lower numbers are better , ight ? More people watch . So do n't tell me that `` you and I '' make good TV . I am an award-winning news producer . I make good TV . You make imbecilic trash watched by housebound inbreds who are so busy putting their hands down thei pants they 're unable to change the channel .
MIKE: I had n't really been picturing you that way , but thanks for the image .
ABBY: Let me tell you something . I am not one of your viewers . My cat stepped on the remote .
MIKE: Thank your pussy for me , then .
ABBY: There is no way Mike Alexander is going to stay on my show . I want you to skewer him . Make him look like a complete idiot . Not that it will be hard . The man is a moron of unseen proportions .
GEORGIA: That 's just what we need on this show .
LARRY: Does anyone think my highlights are too shiny ?
ABBY: Larry , listen to me . I want Mike Alexander to go down in flames . I want Mike Alexander to be nothing ut a pile of ash on the seat next to you . I want the janitor to come in with his Dustbuster and vacuum up the ashes of Mike Alexander , and then when he throws the ashes into the dumpster outside , I want the ats to vomit and then defecate on the ashes of Mike Alexander . She strides off . Larry looks at Georgia .
LARRY: And I thought you were angry and itter .
GEORGIA: Uh , no , that would be my untouched vagina .
GEORGIA: For years , there have been concerns about lowering television standards . But many believe that this man and his local public access show , `` The Ugly Truth , '' have ought things to a new low . With that , we welcome Mike Alexander . Mike gives a cocky wave .
MIKE: How ya doing , guys ?
LARRY: Mike , how do you respond to those who say your show is offensive ?
MIKE: It is but then again , so is the truth .
GEORGIA: The truth about what , Mr. Alexander ?
MIKE: What relationships are really like .
ABBY: C'mon Georgia , let him have it .
GEORGIA: Sounds to me like no one 's eve loved you and you 're taking it out on the female population . In the control room , Abby smirks .
ABBY: Ooh , good one .
MIKE: Well , while we 're making observations , you two project this image of the perfect couple , when clearly , it 's a lie .
LARRY: Excuse me ?
ABBY: Cliff , let 's go to commercial .
CLIFF: Stuart told me to keep rolling , no matter what .
ABBY: What ? When ? Cliff shrugs . Abby is pissed .
CLIFF: Not right now it is n't .
MIKE: I mean , come on Larry , I grew up watching you on TV . You used to be this cool confident cat . Georgia 's no dumb bunny . She knew the only way she was getting off the weekend shift was by hooking up with you . But then lo and behold , she became more popular than you and ended up with twice your salary .
ABBY: C'mon , Larry . Take him down .
LARRY: I 'm proud of my wife 's success .
MIKE: Bullllloney you are . You hate he success . You feel emasculated by her and that screws with your head which inevitably screws with you manhood .
GEORGIA: What 's your point , Mr. Alexander ?
ABBY: Good girl , Georgia . Take control .
MIKE: My point ? My point is that you husband has n't had sex with you inI 'm gon na say . . .three months ?
LARRY: That 's not my fault !
MIKE: I know , it 's her fault !
GEORGIA: Why is it my fault ? !
ABBY: Oh , dear God .
GEORGIA: Well , what am I supposed to do , give up the money , so he can get an erection ?
MIKE: I agree . You 've economically emasculated your husband to such a point that he 's afraid to desire you . Sure , you can dump his ass , ut honey , have you seen the eligible men in Albuquerque ? It 's slim pickings out there for a woman in her forties . You 're not going to do any better than Larry . You just have to let him be a man . LET HIM
CLIFF: And we 're out . He cuts to BLACK .
JOY: Found her . Abby is sitting in a ball in her closet .
STUART: One thousand , one hundred and forty- seven calls and over three hundred E-mails . And fifty-three percent of them were women . This guy 's a lightening rod !
ABBY: People liked him ? !
STUART: Liked him ? They loved him .
ABBY: How is that possible ?
STUART: I do n't know , but I 'm scaling back the news and giving it to `` The Ugly Truth . '' Corporate wants five minutes of Mike Alexander , five days a week .
ABBY: Stuart , I really think this is a mistake
STUART: Just keep him happy and both of ou contracts will be renewed . Stuart leaves . Joy turns back to Abby .
JOY: Congratulations ? Abby closes the closet door on herself .
MIKE: Remember ? How could I forget ? You threw up in my car . JONAH , 14 , awkward , Mike 's nephew , walks in .
JONAH: Dude , you totally hosed me !
MIKE: What ?
JONAH: Last week on your show , you said you should always be mean to hot girls because they 'll want you more . I tried it today , she cried , and then I got detention .
MIKE: First of all - do n't listen to what I say on my show . Second of all , you 're supposed to do that to 25- year-old girls who think they 're hot and can get any guy they want . Not 14-year-old girls . They 're going through puberty . They have enough problems .
JONAH: Mom said when she was fourteen , she was the prettiest girl in the class .
MIKE: Well , I was there when she was fourteen and let me tell you something she lied .
ELIZABETH: Do n't listen to your Uncle Mike , he was blind from masturbating too much .
MIKE: Oh , that 's a nice thing to tell your son
ELIZABETH: It 's nothing worse than what he 's heard on your show . She hands him the cake box .
MIKE: Thanks . He opens the box .
ELIZABETH: Sorry , I did n't have time to bake one . I took it from work . Harold did n't quite make it through the ig day .
MIKE: Looks like he got to blow out his candles .
ELIZABETH: What do you think did him in ? He closes the box .
MIKE: Who wants to go out and eat ?
MIKE: Really ? Because I thought you were gon na get fired if you do n't keep me happy . I 've got a list of demands to go over after the show . And let me just warn you they 're gon na be scatological . She fumes , jabbing the earpiece in his ear .
MIKE CONT'D: Just because you look pretty today , I wo n't mention the misguided phallic rage you just displayed .
ABBY: If you hear my voice in your ear , do what I say .
MIKE: Promise you 'll talk dirty ? Mike is cut off by Cliff in the booth .
CLIFF: Where the hell is he going ? !
ABBY: Follow him !
MIKE: Ah , I see you ladies have started without me .
ABBY: Who let them on the lot ? Do n't we have security ?
MIKE: Babes wrestling in Jello . Let 's just take a quick survey and see which option the men out there would pick .
ABBY: Jesus , if we 're gon na do this , we might as well milk it . Two , go wide ! Good . Ready , one tight on his hand !
MIKE: MmmmI was wrong . It 's cherry . And that 's the ugly truth . Over to you , Georgia .
ABBY: Your realize I once had the Archbishop Desmond Tutu on this show .
MIKE: Who 's that ? Abby rubs her temples .
ABBY: I ca n't even illustrate how fa I 've fallen , because you 're not smart enough to get the references .
MIKE: C'mon , we were a good team back there . You were the one who told me to lick the Jello .
ABBY: Do you have any idea how much I hate myself for that ? ! It was cheap titillation . I am now going to oadcasting hell right behind Geraldo and the naked weather girl from Canada .
MIKE: Seriously ? There 's a naked weathe girl ? Can we get her ?
COLIN: Just stay calm . You 're gon na be fine . The branch breaks .
ABBY: Ahhh ! ! ! Abby FALLS to the ground but Colin CATCHES her . But only for a moment .
COLIN: Whoops .
ABBY: Hi , I 'm Abby .
DWAYNE: `` Dear Mike , I know I 'm the girl who can change you and make you fall in love . Here 's a photo of me and my iguana . '' Steve looks at the photo .
STEVE: I thought iguanas only liked dry places . He passes it to Gary .
GARY: We might need to call animal control on this one .
MIKE: Guys , enough with the fan mail .
STEVE: What ? You do n't want to add he into your rotation ?
MIKE: Uh , no .
DWAYNE: What about the tranny ? He seemed nice .
GARY: And he went to all the trouble to knit you that cock-sock . Mike rolls his eyes and deals the cards .
MIKE: Can we just play poker ?
ABBY: You 're a doctor ?
COLIN: An orthopedic surgeon .
ABBY: Well , I guess I 'm pretty lucky D'Artagnan picked your tree to climb . Dave in the next unit ove sells lawn furniture . I do n't know that I would have been as confident with his diagnosis .
COLIN: I 'm here whenever you need me .
ABBY: Wow , he does n't usually like men .
COLIN: Dogs are great , butwell , you 're a cat person . You know .
ABBY: Well , I guess I should get going now .
COLIN: Any time .
ABBY: Oh . Thanks . There was a spider . On me . But it 's gone now . He chuckles , hands her D'Artagnan .
COLIN: Good night . He closes the door .
ABBY: I 'm such an idiot
COLIN: You alright ? She freezes .
ABBY: Yes . I 'm going now . Good night .
MIKE: If you want a woman to keep sleeping with you there are certain things you never say .
ABBY: I feel so dirty . Mike approaches them .
MIKE: And did you hear Corporate 's coming
ABBY: I hope you can chew with your mouth closed . She turns and walks off .
MIKE: What 's up with her ?
JOY: She 's spiraling lower and lowe into a morass of self-loathing and intense hatred for you .
MIKE: Yeah , I picked up on that .
ABBY: Your innards are of no consequence to me . I hate what you represent .
MIKE: You hate the truth ?
ABBY: Your skewed perception of male- female interaction is not `` the truth '' .
MIKE: But your imaginary boyfriend 's the truth ?
ABBY: For your information , I happened to meet him last night .
MIKE: I really hope he 's real this time , ecause otherwise this is just sad .
ABBY: Oh , he 's very real . Not to mention stunningly handsome and morally sound . His name 's Colin .
MIKE: You know what that means ?
ABBY: What ?
MIKE: He had to stick his finger up some guy 's butt in medical school .
ABBY: You disgust me .
MIKE: So , did butt-boy ask you out ?
ABBY: Not exactly . We 're taking things slow getting to know each othe first . Why am I talking about this with you ?
MIKE: You 're the one who brought it up .
ABBY: Dr. Anderson is everything that you could never be . In fact .
MIKE: You 're calling the guy ? ! You ca n't do that . You 've got ta let him call you .
ABBY: Please . It 's the twenty-first century Abby shoots Mike a snide grin .
COLIN: Oh , hi . Everything okay ? We INTERCUT .
ABBY: Could n't be better . I just wanted to call and tell you how much I enjoyed meeting you .
COLIN: Oh , thanks .
ABBY: So I was just thinking that we should have dinner .
COLIN: Oh great .
ABBY: There 's this new French Bistro that got fantastic reviews and there 's a gallery opening in Old Town on Friday . So , if you want , we could have dinner , then go to the opening .
COLIN: Hmmm , Friday wow .
ABBY: Is that not a good time ?
COLIN: Actually , Abby , I 'm still kind of unsettled with the move and everything so I ` m really not
ABBY: What the hell are you doing ?
MIKE: Saving you . He was blowing you off .
ABBY: He was not .
MIKE: Do n't ! He 'll be expecting you to call him back . When you do n't , he 'll call you .
ABBY: How do you know ?
MIKE: Because I know men . If you want it to work out with this guy , you 'll listen to me and do exactly as I say . You already did irreparable damage with your psycho-aggressive control freak phone call . It might even be too late . Even if you do salvage the situation , you 'll probably never be more than Abby , his desperate neighbor .
ABBY: I 'm not desperate ! Why , did I sound desperate ?
MIKE: Listen to you desperately asking me if you sound desperate .
ABBY: Okay . What do I do ?
MIKE: Pick up the phone and say `` Hey , Doug . ''
ABBY: Why would I
MIKE: Just do it . She answers the phone .
ABBY: Hey , Doug .
COLIN: No , this is Colin . We INTERCUT .
ABBY: Oh my God . Sorry .
COLIN: Who 's Doug ?
MIKE: Just a guy I 'm seeing . It 's nothing serious . Abby hesitates . Mike shoves her .
ABBY: Just a guy I 'm seeing . It 's nothing serious .
COLIN: Oh .
MIKE: Hang on a sec .
ABBY: Hang on a sec . Mike puts the phone on hold .
MIKE: Make him wait . A long pause .
ABBY: This is so rude .
MIKE: That 's the point .
ABBY: When do I pick up ?
MIKE: Never . You make him wait until he gets frustrated and hangs up . If he 's still holding on after thirty more seconds , you may actually have a chance .
ABBY: You 'd better be right about this .
MIKE: Think about it . Would you wait on hold for somebody you were trying to blow off ?
ABBY: You have a point .
MIKE: Just give me a little bit of time and I can make this guy your bitch .
ABBY: I do n't want a `` bitch . '' And Colin would never be a bitch . He 's a well-rounded man capable of mature emotions and deep abiding love . Things which you know not of .
MIKE: Maybe not , but I know about lust , seduction , and manipulation . And clearly , you do not .
ABBY: Why would you want to help me ?
MIKE: Because then you 'll have to admit that I know more about this stuff than you do .
ABBY: My God , you 're right . Now what ? Mike hangs up the phone .
MIKE: Always make an impression . Let 's get out of here . We have work to do .
ABBY: But what about
MIKE: Do n't worry , in five seconds he 'll call back .
ABBY: What are you , Nostradamus ? That 's The phone RINGS again .
COLIN: Unbelievable .
MIKE: Rule number one . Never criticize .
ABBY: Even if it 's constructive ?
MIKE: Never . Men are incapable of growth , change or progress . For men , self- improvement ends at toilet- training . Rule number two . Laugh at whatever he says .
ABBY: What if what he 's saying is n't funny ?
MIKE: That 's irrelevant . A fake laugh is like a fake orgasm .
ABBY: And a fake orgasm is good ?
MIKE: No , but a fake orgasm is bette than no orgasm at all .
ABBY: A fake orgasm is no orgasm .
MIKE: Only to you . You 're not the only person in the room , you know . Let 's not be selfish .
ABBY: You 'll never know . He raises an eyebrow , impressed .
MIKE: Rule number three . Never talk about your problems . Men do n't really listen or care .
ABBY: Some men care .
MIKE: No . Some men pretend to care . When we ask you how you 're doing , it 's just guy code for `` let me put my dick in your ass . ''
ABBY: Okay , I 'm trying to decide whethe I should just walk away right now , or run .
MIKE: I know you think Colin is above it all , but he 's a guy . If he 's even emotely into you , he 's thought about each one of your orifices at least ten times .
ABBY: I love how you assume every man is as perverse as you are .
MIKE: I do n't assume . I know .
ABBY: What 's wrong with my look ?
MIKE: Sports bras ? Khakis ? Srunchies ? Nurse shoes ?
ABBY: These are n't nurse shoes ! They 're Lady Keds .
MIKE: Abby , you 're a very attractive woman but you are completely inaccessible . You 're all about comfort and efficiency .
ABBY: What 's wrong with comfort and efficiency ?
MIKE: Nothing . Except no one wants to fuck it . With that , a MONTAGE BEGINS
ABBY: I am not getting breast implants .
MIKE: Size is n't everything . Breasts just have to be friendly . They have to say , `` Hello , everybody ! Look at me ! '' Abby looks down at her breasts , curiously .
ABBY: What are mine saying ?
MIKE: Uh , `` I 'm reading Tolstoy and I do n't want to be disturbed '' ?
ABBY: Really ? I hate Tolstoy . A SALESWOMAN passes them .
SALESWOMAN: This should do the trick .
MIKE: Sweet . Strap it on , flapjacks . Abby glares at him as we CUT TO
ABBY: I look like a hooker .
MIKE: That 's a good thing .
ABBY: You 're not touching my hair until I know exactly what you 're going to do with it .
MIKE: We 're giving you bedhead .
ABBY: Why would I want bedhead ?
MIKE: Bedhead is sexy . A ponytail implies that you are either operating heavy machinery o emptying the litter box . Neither of these things inspires an erection .
ABBY: Well just do n't sit there . Say something .
MIKE: Glasses .
ABBY: Huh ?
MIKE: You need glasses .
ABBY: But I wear contacts . Besides , does n't the woman usually remove glasses during a makeover ?
MIKE: Yeah , but we 're going for a stripper­librarian thing . Right now , I would n't trust you to find me a book .
ABBY: I know how to flirt .
MIKE: Do you want to be an old maid ?
ABBY: So , if I do n't listen to you , I 'll e an old maid ?
MIKE: `` My name 's Abby and I 'm arthritic and alone . I have eighteen cats who keep me company . ''
ABBY: Oh , ha ha . That 's very funny . `` Are you wearing underwear ? '' She grabs his ass .
MIKE: Come on ! I would n't say that and I would n't grab ass .
ABBY: `` Hey babe , what 's wrong with a little ass grabbing ? '' `` I mean what 's the point of you even having one unless it 's there for me to grab it ? You 're just a set of orifices and a pair of tee- tas . ''
MIKE: You 're a deeply , deeply disturbed person .
ABBY: Maybe I 'm just a good student .
MIKE: Would you stop doing that ?
ABBY: Doing what ?
MIKE: Touching me with your finger . She seductively leans into him .
ABBY: Why ? Am I turning you on ?
MIKE: Maybe . She gives him a look .
ABBY: Actually , I kind of like it .
MIKE: Really She leans in closer .
ABBY: Sucker . He shoves her away .
MIKE: No teaching the teacher . Just then , the doorbell RINGS .
ABBY: Who is it ?
MIKE: Told you he 'd drop by .
ABBY: I 'm not ready for this . Am I ? I 'm not .
MIKE: Calm down . Keep the conversation under a minute . Be mysterious . Keep him guessing .
ABBY: Oh . Hey .
COLIN: Hi . Wow , you look great .
ABBY: Thanks .
COLIN: What happened to you today ?
ABBY: What do you mean ?
COLIN: You put me on hold and did n't call me back .
ABBY: That was you ? I 'm so sorry .
ABBY: Now what ?
MIKE: Make him suffer .
COLIN: Do you follow baseball ? We INTERCUT with Mike .
MIKE: There 's no right answer to that question . Do something non- committal
COLIN: I 'm really more of a fair weathe fan myself . I do like watching Mike DeLoggia pitch , though . Amazing one structure .
MIKE: Laugh .
COLIN: What 's so funny ?
ABBY: Your joke .
COLIN: What joke ?
MIKE: Shit , he was serious ?
ABBY: Thank you .
COLIN: For what ? Abby realizes she 's spoken aloud .
ABBY: Thank you for just being you .
COLIN: You 're welcome
MIKE: Okay , no more improvising . Just epeat everything I say , `` You 're so much fun to be with . ''
ABBY: You 're so much fun to be with .
COLIN: Thanks . A FAN calls to Mike .
FAN: Hey , down in front !
MIKE: You 're not like the other guys I ` ve dated .
ABBY: You 're not like the other guys I 've dated .
FAN: Hey , sit down , jackass .
MIKE: You 're so much more interesting and informed .
ABBY: You 're so much more interesting and informed .
COLIN: That 's nice to hear .
MIKE: Dude , what the fuck ? !
ABBY: Dude , what the fuck ? !
COLIN: What ? Abby blanches , waiting for Mike instructions .
MIKE: Oh , shit .
ABBY: Oh , shit . Colin is now just staring at her .
MIKE: No , I 'm not talking to you .
ABBY: I 'm not talking to you .
COLIN: Did I do something wrong ?
MIKE: Abby , listen tell him you saw him looking at another girl . It 's the only way out of this .
ABBY: Were you looking at another girl ?
COLIN: Who ?
ABBY: Uh her ?
COLIN: Yeah . I was just trying to get us a hot dog .
ABBY: Oh .
MIKE: Alright , we need a recovery . Make sure to eat your hot dog slowly . Men like watching penis-shaped food go into a girl 's mouth .
ABBY: What ? !
COLIN: It 's fine , really
ABBY: No , I have to get it out or else it will stain She puts some muscle into it .
COLIN: Cotton .
ABBY: Cotton 's the worst . Well actually leather 's the worst , followed by suede
POLICE OFFICER: This is a family place , ma'am . Not an open-air hand job palace .
ABBY: I understand , officer .
POLICE OFFICER: You want to pull those kind of stunts , you do it at home . Or in the backseat of a car , like moral upstanding people do . He hands her a ticket and walks off .
COLIN: Well , I ca n't say it was boring .
ABBY: That was pretty much the all-time worst first date ever .
COLIN: Gee , thanks . Mike looks worried .
MIKE: Where are you going with this ? No guy wants to hear that !
ABBY: No , no , I take full responsibility . So Thanks . But , hey , at least your pants are clean . He smiles , amused .
COLIN: You 're not what I 'm used to .
ABBY: I know
COLIN: Actually , that 's a good thing . I 'm used to women I can figure out in five seconds . I ca n't do that with you . Mike rolls his eyes .
MIKE: He 's an idiot . I figured you out in two .
ABBY: Good night .
MIKE: And walk away .
COLIN: That definitely made up for my wet crotch .
ABBY: Me , too . Just scratch that .
MIKE: I did n't do anything . It was you . Do n't ask me why , but I think he likes you .
ABBY: He 's really a great guy , is n't he ?
MIKE: Yeah , he 's dreamy .
ABBY: And he fits all ten criteria on my checklist !
MIKE: Rightwere n't items one through nine something to do with him pretty much being gay ? Abby puts her key in the door .
ABBY: I 'm going to ignore that because I 'm in a very good mood .
MIKE: Yeah , I heard , wet crotch .
JONAH: So , no date tonight ?
MIKE: As a matter of fact , I did have a date . It was n't mine , but it was a date . I was helping out a friend .
JONAH: Guy or girl ?
MIKE: Girl .
JONAH: Oohis she hot ?
MIKE: She would be if she were less irritating .
JONAH: So she likes to make fun of you clothes and stuff ?
MIKE: No , actually I make fun of hers ' .
JONAH: You told me not to do that .
MIKE: That 's right . And you should listen to me .
JONAH: If you know so much about chicks , why are you sitting here playing `` Fight Night '' with me when you could be out with the Jello girls ?
MIKE: Because this is better .
ELIZABETH: Hurry , take a picture of me . I 'm online with Fugly35 and he wants to know what i look like .
MIKE: You really want to go out with a guy named Fugly35 ?
ELIZABETH: He 's being ironic . Look , he 's hot . She holds up her laptop . Mike peers at it .
MIKE: Uhlook closer . That 's Jim Morrison . Who I 'm pretty sure is n't an accountant in Rio Rancho .
ELIZABETH: Shit . Are you serious ? Jonah holds out his hand to his mom .
JONAH: You owe me a dollar .
MIKE: What are you wasting your time on the internet for anyway ?
ELIZABETH: Says the man who has n't had a decent relationship since 1999 .
MIKE: At least I date .
ELIZABETH: Noyou fornicate .
DR. LESTER: Of all primates , Bonobos are the closest relatives to human beings , oth genetically and socially ­- especially when it comes to sex . For the Bonobo , sex is a way to ease stress and diffuse tensions .
MIKE: So summing up Bonobo-land , the chicks look great , get freaky in ed and in turn , they get to sit on their asses and boss their men around all day .
DR. LESTER: That 's one way of looking at it .
MIKE: If that 's not an argument fo evolution , I do n't know what is . He winks at the camera as
CAMERA GUY: Cut !
MIKE: What did you think ?
ABBY: It was good .
MIKE: Did you hear Corporate 's taking me to Saffron tonight ? What do you think
ABBY: Colin called . He wants to get together again .
MIKE: Cool .
ABBY: How long do you think I should wait to sleep with him ?
MIKE: The more you make him beg for it , the more you 've got him on the hook . Do everything but . Then show him beneath that control freak exterior , there 's a sexual deviant waiting to be unleashed .
ABBY: I am not a sexual deviant .
MIKE: Good point . If memory serves us ight , you 've been out of practice for what ? A year ?
ABBY: Noeleven months .
MIKE: Alright , well , how often do you
ABBY: Do I what ?
MIKE: You know Flick the bean ?
ABBY: What bean ? Mike throws her a look . Abby catches on .
MIKE: No , I call it masturbating , but I thought it would offend you delicate lady-like sensibilities . So how often do you flick it ?
MIKE: What could be more personal ?
ABBY: I just do n't think of myself that way .
MIKE: Well , you need to start . Because if you do n't want to have sex with you , why the hell should Colin ?
ABBY: Great .
MIKE: You have to come with me .
ABBY: Where ?
MIKE: My dinner with Corporate . I do n't want to fuck it up .
ABBY: I ca n't . I have a date with Colin .
MIKE: We 'll pick him up on the way .
ABBY: Mike , I 'm not going on your dinner .
MIKE: So , if it does n't go well and they cut the segment and the ratings go ack down to negative fourteen and they cancel the show , you 're cool with that ? Abby thinks a moment , then
ABBY: Let me get my purse .
COLIN: Hey , you 're early
ABBY: Yeah Mike pops out from behind Abby .
MIKE: I 'm Mike . Change in plans . Gra your keys . We got ta go . As Colin looks confused , we CUT TO
ABBY: We 'll just stay for one drink . I 'm eally sorry about this .
COLIN: No worries . Are you a news producer as well ?
MIKE: No , dude , I 'm the talent .
COLIN: So you 're one of the anchors ?
MIKE: No , `` The Ugly Truth . '' Has n't he ever seen our show ?
ABBY: Not everyone wants to start thei day by watching you rant about implants and g-strings .
COLIN: You talk about g-strings ?
ABBY: Oh , look ! We 're here !
MIKE: Hey , ladies . You 're looking quite fetching .
BAMBI: Hi , Mike !
CANDI: Do you like my dress ? She leans over and displays her cleavage .
ABBY: Are these the Jello Girls ?
MIKE: Yeah , they 're my dates .
STUART: Hey , the gang 's all here ! Abby , you know Harold and Bob .
ABBY: Of course .
BOB: And we all know Mike Alexander They slap him on the back , eyeing the twins .
HAROLD: And who are these lovely ladies ?
BOB: Something tells me we wo n't be talking about the news tonight
MIKE: So , you guys here to give me a aise , or what ?
STUART: That 's my guy . Always with the jokes . Abby turns to Bob and Harold .
ABBY: We 're really excited about the atings increase this year . Next quarter we hope to
COLIN: What 's wrong ?
ABBY: Nothing She leans down to grab her purse .
MIKE: What are you doing ?
ABBY: I 'm looking for the remote .
MIKE: What remote ?
ABBY: Fortheunderwear . Mike starts laughing .
MIKE: You 're wearing them ? Now ?
COLIN: Are you okay ?
ABBY: This ceviche is just so.GOOD ! I 'm going to ask the chef for the ooh recipe ! Excuse me She starts to get up when Stuart stops her .
STUART: Hold on . Tell Harold about the new teaser campaign we 're starting next week . You 're going to love this .
MIKE: Yeah , Abby . Tell us about the teasers . Abby glares at Mike and sits back down .
ABBY: Well , it 's fifteen secondseach hour .
MIKE: Actually , I 'm really enjoying the way you 're telling them .
CANDI: What 's in a ceviche ?
ABBY: It 's fifteen seconds every hour of Mike telling an Ugly Truth andJesusGOD , they 're good . She leaps to her feet . ABBY Ohhhhh
STUART: See what I mean about her ?
COLIN: You 've got to love her enthusiasm .
MIKE: Sorry , buddy , that 's my toy .
ABBY: You knew he had it the whole time , did n't you ?
MIKE: No , just part of the time . Figured I should let you finish . She shoots him a look . MIKE Seriously , thanks for coming tonight . I mean , you know , to dinner .
ABBY: You would have done fine without me .
MIKE: I know .
ABBY: Really ? Colin walks up .
COLIN: Are we ready to go ? I know Abby is . Harold and Bob shake hands with Mike .
HAROLD: Keep up the good work , Mike .
BOB: And thanks for introducing us to our future ex-wives .
MIKE: You kids play safe .
COLIN: I think we 've got it from here . Mike 's truck pulls up and he gets in .
MIKE: Do n't do anything I would n't do .
COLIN: I ca n't believe I 've never seen this before . Abby grins , pleased .
DRUNK GUY: Dude , you got me laid three times last month . Drinks are on me .
MIKE: Just doing my job .
CUTE BRUNETTE: I got implants , just like you said !
MIKE: Indeed you did .
DWAYNE: Here 's to implants ! Steve clinks his beer bottle against Mike 's .
STEVE: You 're a rock star , bro .
WAITER: A bottle of water to start ?
COLIN: Yes , a bottle of flat , please .
ABBY: I 'll have one , too . Colin smiles at her as THE MONTAGE ENDS .
MIKE: I forgot , Colin only likes `` women of quality . ''
ABBY: That 's a trait to be admired , not mocked , man-whore .
MIKE: Who says I 'm a man-whore ?
ABBY: I 've seen you with the Funbag Twins , remember ?
MIKE: You saw me what ? Take them to dinner and introduce them to some network executives ? They want to be actresses . Who am I to kill thei dreams ?
ABBY: You 're telling me you 've neve slept with those girls ?
MIKE: I did n't say that
ABBY: Exactly my point . Man-whores want women who wear slutty clothes and suck lots of cock .
MIKE: Every man wants that . And for you information , I was only with the one who can read . Did you just say cock ?
ABBY: What ? I can say cock . You do n't own that word . Cock . There . I said it again .
MIKE: A week ago you cried at the thought of a vibrator . Now you 're all `` cock this , '' '' cock that . '' You had sex with Colin , did n't you ?
ABBY: NO ! We 're saving that for this weekend . He 's taking me to Santa Fe .
MIKE: You sure you 're ready for that ?
ABBY: Of course I 'm ready .
MIKE: You do n't sound ready .
ABBY: Well , I am ready . Mike holds up a glass .
MIKE: Here 's to overturning assumptions . I 'm really a man of discriminating taste and you 're a foul-mouthed slut .
JOY: What happened to him ? That sounded almost enlightened .
MIKE: Because once you do peel back those layers , my friends , her lady garden awaits . And I 'm pretty sure you 're gon na want to fertilize that patch of petunias . And that there is the Ugly Truth .
JOY: And he 's back .
LARRY: Next up , Javier tells us if you petunias are going to see any ainfall this weekend . Georgia winks at him .
GEORGIA: I hope mine do Abby rolls her eyes as Mike walks up .
ABBY: Yes , the city gets treated to flower-vagina metaphors . Georgia O'Keefe would be so pleased .
AGENT: Are you ready for this ? I just got you on to `` The Tonight Show '' . They want you as a guest . Mike is stunned .
MIKE: Jay Leno wants me on his show ? You 're shitting me . Abby looks at the agent , confused .
ABBY: Who are you ?
MIKE: This is Rick . My agent .
ABBY: Since when do you have an agent ?
AGENT: Since he became the hottest thing in morning TV .
MIKE: Holy shit . Leno ? This is amazing .
ABBY: Yeah
AGENT: You leave tomorrow . Let 's go clea it with Stuart .
MIKE: How cool is this ? They walk off as Abby stands there .
ABBY: What 's our story at the top of the hour ?
JOSH: Global warming .
DORI: Jesus . Again ?
JOSH: Oh , I 'm sorry , did Anna Nicole come ack from the dead ? Stuart pokes his head in .
STUART: Abby ? I need you . She rises and goes out into the hall .
ABBY: What 's up ?
STUART: I just found out Mike was offered a job by the local NBC affiliate at twice the pay . This Leno thing is his audition .
ABBY: What ? !
STUART: If Bob and Harold find out about this , we 're dead . I need you to fly out there and talk him out of it .
ABBY: Today ? Now ? But I 'm going to Santa Fe
STUART: Just do n't let him know you know eforehand . Let him do the show and get us our publicity , then convince him to sign with us for the next three years . Now go .
ABBY: Hi , stupid motherfucker who 'd still e on cable access if it were n't for me . I hear you 're moving to
CAB DRIVER: What did you just call me ?
ABBY: Nothing . Just practicing my speech .
MIKE: Abby ? What are you doing here ?
ABBY: Stuart decided you needed a cheerleader .
MIKE: I thought you were going to Santa Fe
ABBY: Apparently , he felt that you needed a producer more than I needed to get laid .
MIKE: I 'm sorry you did n't get to meet little Colin this weekend . And by little , I do n't mean undersized , although I highly suspect that 's the case .
ABBY: Really ? Colin 's penis ? That 's what you want to talk about right now ? I was thinking maybe we should talk about what you 're gon na say on the show . So , tell me Mike . How did `` The Ugly Truth '' start ?
MIKE: Well , Jay , I had a sales job where I drove around a lot , listening to talk radio . I started calling in and lo and behold , people liked what I had to say . Then I decided what the hell , I need my own show . I have a message people need to hear . Abby rolls her eyes , still angry with him .
ABBY: Yes thousands of lives are being enriched by your wisdom .
MIKE: Excuse me , lady , but you have a oyfriend right now because of me .
ABBY: It may have started because of you , ut it 's lasted because of me .
MIKE: So , you 've been acting like you normal control freak psycho self in front of him ?
ABBY: I 'm not a control freak .
MIKE: When you checked into the hotel , did you or did you not insist on getting an `` Eastern-facing '' room on `` a floor not below seven '' ?
ABBY: I like rising with the sun . And a view .
MIKE: My point is , Colin likes the Mike version of Abby , not the Abby version of Abby . So , do n't go knocking my words of wisdom when you 're living proof that they work . Abby sits there , fuming that he 's right .
ABBY: I could be having sex right now
MIKE: Yeah , thanks to me .
AGENT: Dude , this is awesome . You 're about to go on Leno ! NBC is going to give you the moon
MIKE: This is n't helping .
AGENT: Just do what you always do .
MIKE: What do I always do ?
AGENT: Uh
ABBY: You entertain people with you moronery . And they love you for it . Mike looks at her , surprised .
MIKE: That might be the nicest thing you 've ever said to me .
ABBY: Your welcome .
JAY: So what 's your number one piece of advice to all the people out there who are trying to find love ?
MIKE: Do n't do it . Try to find lust instead . It 's a lot easier and a lot less messy . Blue balls only last a few hours . A broken heart can last years .
JAY: So , what 's her name ?
MIKE: Who ?
JAY: The girl who screwed you up . She must have been a doozy .
MIKE: Like I said , better a floozy than a doozy .
JAY: Well , what do you say to guys like me who have been happily married for twenty-seven years ? We ca n't be the exception to the rule , can we ? There 's plenty of us out there .
MIKE: Well , Jay , let me tell ya
JAY: You 're right . I 'm going to get a divorce . My whole life is a lie . Sorry , honey . The audience laughs , as we CUT TO
STUART: Did you get him ? Is he ours ?
ABBY: I 'm working on it . She hangs up as Mike and his Agent approach . ABBY You were amazing out there .
MIKE: Was I ?
AGENT: You go ahead and hold our table , doll . We 've got some business to discuss .
ABBY: Where 's Rick ?
MIKE: I sent him home . I thought we should celebrate on our own . Abby 's surprised , then suspicious .
ABBY: What exactly are we celebrating ?
MIKE: Uh , hello ? Leno ? I was just on it . Maybe you saw ?
ABBY: I know about the offer from NBC . He looks at her , surprised , then
MIKE: Okay , well then you know I turned it down . If it were n't for you , I 'd still be on Channel 83 . So do n't worry , I 'm not going anywhere .
ABBY: Really ?
MIKE: Relax . Drink . Enjoy . You did you job . I 'm re-signing with you . Now let 's stop talking about work . Abby sips her mojito , studying Mike .
ABBY: Sowho was the doozy ?
MIKE: What are you , trying to kill my uzz ?
ABBY: No , I 'm interested . In what makes youyou . Mike sighs , deciding to level with her .
MIKE: It was n't just oneit was more like a parade . By the time I hit thirty , I realized you can only have so many bad relationships efore you figure out there 's no such thing as a good one .
ABBY: You ca n't really believe there 's no such thing as a good relationship .
MIKE: To my very core . Just then , the waitress walks up .
WAITRESS: Two more mojitos ?
ABBY: And some water , please .
WAITRESS: Still or sparkling ?
MIKE: Just bring us tap water . She nods and leaves . Abby stares at him .
ABBY: So I 've been told . He stands up .
MIKE: C'mon , let 's dance .
ABBY: I do n't think so .
MIKE: I 'm serious . I 've seen your spazzy dance , now I want to see the real thing .
ABBY: I ca n't dance like that .
MIKE: I can . Mike grabs her hand and leads her onto
ABBY: Mike , no
MIKE: You 'll be fine .
ABBY: Oh my God . How did you learn to ­-
ABBY: So the car 's picking us up downstairs at eight . You want me to call you ?
MIKE: I 'll get a wake up call .
ABBY: Good idea . There 's a moment of uncomfortable silence . ABBY I had a great time .
MIKE: Me , too .
ABBY: Remember , the car 's
MIKE: Picking us up at eight . Got it . The elevator comes to a stop .
ABBY: Bright and early .
MIKE: Good night . Neither lets go . They give a longer kiss .
ABBY: Good night .
MIKE: Good night .
ABBY: Yeah .
COLIN: Miss me ? It takes a moment for Abby to adjust .
ABBY: Colin ?
COLIN: You were expecting someone else ?
ABBY: Uh , no He walks in the room , holding up the wine .
COLIN: Since you could n't come to Santa Fe , I decided to come to you .
ABBY: How 'd you find me ?
COLIN: Joy told me . I started thinking about all the things we were going to do there and I decided I could n't wait .
ABBY: Oh . Okay
COLIN: What 's the matter ?
ABBY: Nothing . I 'm just so surprised to see you .
COLIN: Well , you told me you were spontaneous . Guess the proof is in the pudding .
ABBY: It sure is
COLIN: Whoops . Looks like we 'll have to get naked sooner than I thought .
MIKE: Abby I really need to kiss you again . And not just in a one-night stand way , in a totally different way . Oh fuck , what am I doing ?
COLIN: Oh , you 're not room service . How ya ' doin ' , man ? Mike reels , trying to cover his shock .
MIKE: I just came by to tell Abby about the change in our flight time . But I can tell her later . Abby appears behind Colin .
ABBY: Mike , what are you doing here ?
MIKE: Just leaving . He turns and goes .
ABBY: Mike He keeps walking as she tries to keep up . ABBY He just showed up to surprise me .
MIKE: How convenient .
ABBY: I thought it was you at the door . He stops and looks at her .
MIKE: I guess we 're all interchangeable . I 've taught you well . Maybe you should take over the show . He starts to walk off .
ABBY: Mike , wait tell me what just happened in the elevator . They hold eye contact for a very long moment . ABBY Should I tell Colin to go ? Mike looks away .
MIKE: Why pull up anchor now ? You 've worked damn hard to get him here .
ABBY: Really ? That 's it ? That 's all you have to say .
MIKE: What else do you want me to say ? A lot . But he 's not saying it .
ABBY: I guess the truth is ugly , is n't it ?
MIKE: That 's what I 've been telling you . He shrugs and walks off .
ABBY: Sorry , about that . He was upset about his performance on Leno .
COLIN: No worries . The rest of the night is ours . He pours her a glass of wine . COLIN To the first of many romantic evenings to come .
ABBY: Why do you like me ?
COLIN: Well , you 're beautiful , you 're smart Abby smiles , pleased , then he continues COLIN You 're open , you laugh at my jokes , you never criticize Abby 's smile fades . COLIN You never try to control the situation , and I 've got to say , it 's a breath of fresh air . A lot of women I know are total control freaks and it 's a nightmare . I love that you 're not like that . Abby looks at him , nodding , then
ABBY: You know what ? I am like that .
COLIN: What do you mean ?
ABBY: To be honest , I did n't like the way you poured the wine . I would have decanted it . And I was editing that speech as you were giving it . She looks around . ABBY Plus , this bed should be facing north-south instead of east-west !
COLIN: Are you serious ?
ABBY: I have n't been myself for one second of the two weeks and five days we 've been dating .
COLIN: Then who have you been ?
ABBY: The girl some idiot told me to be .
FLIGHT ATTENDANT: Miss , we 're going to need you to oard now .
ABBY: Morning , Freddy .
STUART: I thought you said we had him .
ABBY: What are you talking about ?
STUART: He quit this morning . I got a smug call from Channel 4 saying they closed a deal with him . Corporate 's having a shit fit . What the hell happened ?
ABBY: We do n't need Mike Alexander . He 's a dime a dozen .
STUART: You better hope so , because you 're going to find me a new one by the end of the week .
ABBY: Yes . No . Yes . No . No . I ca n't believe I even considered for a second allowing myself to feel something for him .
JOY: I still ca n't believe that you oke up with Colin .
ABBY: I know I ca n't control everything . As much as I 'd like to .
BIG WIG: What do you think of the new set ?
MIKE: Love it .
BIG WIG: And this is Joe , your new producer .
MIKE: You know what I like best about you , Joe ? I do n't want to have sex with you at all .
JOE: I 'm relieved to hear that . The Big Wigs chortle .
BIG WIG: How much do we love this guy ?
JONAH: Dude , check it out . Balloon Fiesta .
MIKE: Yep .
JONAH: Why do you look like a lawyer ?
MIKE: New station . New wardrobe .
JONAH: You 're never going to get any pussy looking like that .
MIKE: Where do you get this stuff ?
JONAH: From you .
MIKE: Look at me , Jonah . I 'm 38 , I 'm still single , I live alone Does it look like it 's all working out ? If there 's one thing you do n't want to be , it 's like me .
JONAH: I 'm pretty sure you do n't want to open your new show with that .
JACK MAGNUM: How 's my skin ? Too shiny ? How are my pores ?
JOY: Tiny .
JACK MAGNUM: Which side is better ? Left ? Right ? Full-frontal ? Joy looks at Abby , a little worried .
ABBY: They 're all fine . But let 's go over your intro . `` I 'm Jack Magnum and this is ''
JACK MAGNUM: The Ugly Truth !
ABBY: Oh-kay . Let 's maybe lose the gun .
JACK MAGNUM: What ? The gun is my signature move .
ABBY: Unless the NRA is paying you mortgage this month , I say lose the fucking gun .
JOY: And we 're live in five , four , three , two
CLIFF: Think this guy 's any good ?
STUART: He better be .
STUART: Oh , Jesus . He 's going political .
JONAH: Dude , check this out . You eplacement 's on .
MIKE: My what ? Mike looks over to see
JACK MAGNUM: Most of you are watching this show so you can learn how to get chicks . Let me assure you , you 're in good hands . You 're looking at a guy who 's personally had sex with ove 137 women . Most of them conscious .
ABBY: He 's ad-libbing . Why is he ad- libbing ? There 's no ad-libbing .
MIKE: Oh , this is beautiful .
CLIFF: What is she doing ?
STUART: Hey , Harold . Yes , I know we 're fixing it .
ABBY: Take Mike Alexander , for instance . He up and quit the show without so much as a word . You think you know what men are going to do , you think you know what they want to dobut when it comes down to the moment where they actually have to nut up , they turn around and do something completely different .
MIKE: Oh , I 'm all over this . He races out , as Jonah calls after him .
JONAH: I do n't think she 's into you , guy !
ABBY: The big , strong , romantic men we 've een reading about in novels and watching in movies since we were nine ? They 're fallacies . `` Blue Lagoon '' is a total freakin ' lie . Men are not strong . Men are not ave. Men are afraid .
LARRY: I love `` Blue Lagoon '' . Georgia squeezes his hand .
GEORGIA: I know you do , honey .
ABBY: They 're afraid to say what they feel . Afraid to grow up . Afraid to tell the truth .
JONAH: It 's like she 's in his brain !
ABBY: Even if they have a moment in a hotel elevator that 's totally omantic and filled with potential , men are completely incapable of copping to it . Because men are weak .
MIKE: Women would have us believe that they are the victims . They are n't . They want us to think that we break their hearts for sport . That 's crap . They say they want romance . They say they want true love , but all they want is a checklist . Is he perfect ? Is he handsome ? Is he a doctor ?
CLIFF: I thought he quit .
STUART: See ? I told you she 'd get him back .
ABBY: That is not true . BY THE CAMERAMAN , Joy shrugs .
JOY: Well , kinda true . Mike continues his rant .
MIKE: You men that fit the criteria do n't kid yourselves . They 're not sleeping with you . They 're sleeping with a carefully calculated set of venal choices . Money ove substance . Looks over soul . Polish over principles . No gesture , no matter how real or romantic , will ever compensate for a really impressive list of credentials .
ABBY: Says the man who 's never made a gesture except for this one
MIKE: So , the elevator was n't a gesture ?
ABBY: The elevator was a moment of passion , followed by a moment of panic on your part , apparently .
STUART: What elevator ?
MIKE: I came by your room !
ABBY: And then you ran away .
MIKE: Well , that was n't panic , sweetheart . It was an unwillingness to compete with the walking checklist that was in your bed . You should be thanking me . NEARBY , Joy taps her watch .
JOY: We have ten seconds . An OVERZEALOUS BALLOON PILOT walks up .
PILOT: Are we ready to soar up , up and away ? IN THE BASKET , Mike looks at the camera .
MIKE: And that 's the Ugly Truth , folks . A girl in heat for two guys will always pick the one with the bette esume .
ABBY: That is bullsh
JOY: And we 're out . Keep rolling on B-camera .
ABBY: I hate you so much I just swore on live television .
MIKE: No , you hate yourself for being so shallow .
PILOT: Off we go !
ABBY: Where are we going ? !
MIKE: I 'm not going anywhere with you . Mike starts to climb out .
ABBY: What a shock . You 're bailing .
PILOT: I would n't recommend that Mike looks down to see
STUART: They do n't know the camera is on , do they ?
CLIFF: Nuh-uh .
MIKE: Hey ! I know we can pass the time with you telling me how much fun you and Colin had having sex in Los Angeles .
ABBY: I broke up with Colin in Los Angeles , jackass . Mike is thrown , turning to look at her .
MIKE: What ?
PILOT: To our left , we have the Sandia Mountains , glistening in the afternoon twilight Abby ignores the pilot .
ABBY: Oh , that got your interest ? If you think we 're going to finish what we started in LA , you 're out of you mind . You lost your chance .
PILOT: And to our right , you 'll see the Rio Grande River winding its way through the diochramatic landscape Mike ignores the pilot as well .
MIKE: I never had a chance with you .
PILOT: And off in the distance , we have the Petroglyph National Monument , where
ABBY: Can you stop talking , please ?
MIKE: What does that mean ?
ABBY: `` I 'm Mike Alexander . I like girls in Jello . I like to fuck like a monkey . Do n't fall in love it 's ` scary . ' ''
JOY: Do n't worry , I saw this coming , so I got us a three second delay .
MIKE: Yeah , it is `` scary . '' It 's fucking terrifying . Especially because I 'm in love with a psycho like you .
ELIZABETH: Did he just say
JONAH: `` Love '' ?
ABBY: I am not a psycho .
MIKE: I just told you I loved you and all you heard was `` psycho '' . You are the definition of neurotic .
ABBY: The definition of neurotic is a person who suffers from anxiety , obsessional thoughts , compulsive acts and physical ailments without having any objective evidence of disease
MIKE: Again , I just told you I 'm in love with you and you 're standing here giving me a vocabulary lesson . Back me up on this , buddywho here is afraid ?
PILOT: I 'm just going to drink my champagne .
ABBY: You 're in love with me . Really . Why ?
MIKE: Beats the shit out of me , but I am .
STUART: Joy , how do you feel about a promotion ?
JOY: I feel good about it .
ABBY: If you say `` just kidding '' , I 'm going to throw you out of this alloon and watch your body splatter to the ground .
MIKE: Are you going to threaten me with death when we have sex ? Because it might be distracting . The Pilot looks worried for his safety .
PILOT: May I suggest you wait until we land ?
MIKE: As many of you know , sometimes a guy 's got ta admit what he thought was the truth is n't necessarily the whole truth . Yes , women have a checklist , but sometimes that list includes a foul-mouthed idiot who took way too long to realize he was in love . Let 's continue this conversation in a second . WE PULL BACK to REVEAL
JONAH: Has anyone ever told you you have a stupendous bosom ?
JOY: Not lately , so feel free to say it again .
MIKE: Zoom in on this , guys . I want the whole city to see how lucky I am .
ELIZABETH: What ? No one 's ever going to elieve this . I need proof .
ABBY: What 's this ?
MIKE: Hope you do n't mind , but we 're live .
ABBY: No , what 's Jorge doing so close ? We need a master .
MIKE: You knew about this ?
ABBY: HelloI 'm the producer . It 's sweeps week . How do you think I got them to pay for this ?
MIKE: God , I love you . He turns to the camera .
ABBY: Is n't it beautiful ?
LUCIEN ESNAULT: C'est parti .
GEORGINA: Albert ! Elle parle avec un léger accent étranger .
LUCIEN ESNAULT: Sur l'honneur ! Albert contourne le comptoir .
LUCIEN ESNAULT: Bon !

ALBERT QUENTIN: Si . J'aurais bu avec lui . Suzanne se retourne vers son mari .
SUZANNE QUENTIN: Albert , tu parlais pas sérieusement ?
SUZANNE QUENTIN: Réponds-moi d'abord . Il ferme la fenêtre .
SUZANNE QUENTIN: Oh !
SUZANNE QUENTIN: Albert !
SUZANNE QUENTIN: L'imprévu ? Qu'est-ce que ça veut dire ? Albert lui répond d'une voix plus calme .
SUZANNE QUENTIN: Il est à la cuisine . L'homme se précipite vers la cuisine .
LE CONDUCTEUR: Vous êtes complètement cinglé , non ?
GABRIEL FOUQUET: Olé !
LE CONDUCTEUR: I say , you 're crazy !
GABRIEL FOUQUET: Olé !
LA FOULE: Olé ! Olé ! Olé !

GABRIEL FOUQUET: Olé , carabineros ! Como va ustedes ?
ALBERT QUENTIN: Y en a pas eu , d'accident . Il se tourne vers Maurice .
ALBERT QUENTIN: Ben , j'espère , ou alors il est incorrigible .
ALBERT QUENTIN: Et ben , qu'est-ce qui vous prend ? Gabriel relève la tête .
GABRIEL FOUQUET: Je crois que j'ai honte .
ALBERT QUENTIN: D'accord , mais pas chez Esnault . Il lui prend le coude et l'entraîne avec lui .
GABRIEL FOUQUET: Dites donc Albert s'arrête et se tourne vers Gabriel .
ALBERT QUENTIN: Quoi ?
GABRIEL FOUQUET: Qu'est-ce que c'est que votre endroit ?
GABRIEL FOUQUET: Vous y allez souvent ?
ALBERT QUENTIN: J ' y allais . Il reprend son escalade , suivi par Gabriel .
ALBERT QUENTIN: Que ce soit fermé . Il reprend sa marche .
GEORGINA: C'est pas possible ! C'est un revenant ! Elle regarde Albert avec un grand sourire .
ALBERT QUENTIN: Je te permets .

GABRIEL FOUQUET: Y t'ont payé avec un billet de train Albert le lui prend des mains .

GABRIEL FOUQUET: J'peux pas
ALBERT QUENTIN: T'as pas confiance ?
GABRIEL FOUQUET: J'ai pas de billet
GEORGINA: Bonsoir , et bonne rentrée .
GABRIEL FOUQUET: Madame , j'ai été charmé , positivement charmé . Il sort à son tour , d'un pas un peu hésitant .
GABRIEL FOUQUET: Merde !
GABRIEL FOUQUET: T'as le coup de pompe ? Du pouce , Albert montre le bar derrière lui .
GABRIEL FOUQUET: A qui ça ?
ALBERT QUENTIN: Aux affreux ! Allez viens .
ALBERT QUENTIN: Deux Calvas !
LUCIEN ESNAULT: Sois le bienvenu , Albert . Il redescend lentement vers le comptoir .
GABRIEL FOUQUET: T'es qui ?
MADAME ESNAULT: Lucien !
ALBERT QUENTIN: Et ce n'est qu'un coup de semonce .
LUCIEN ESNAULT: Ah ! Ah ! Laisse-le moi , hein !
MADAME ESNAULT: Partez , ou j'appelle les gendarmes !
GABRIEL FOUQUET: Albert Hmm ?
LUCIEN ESNAULT: Et les calvas , qui c'est qui va les payer ? Albert et Gabriel se retournent vers lui .
GABRIEL FOUQUET: On méprise .
ALBERT QUENTIN: Quoi ?
GABRIEL FOUQUET: J'ai peur que ta femme soit pas contente .
ALBERT QUENTIN: Parle pas de femmes en patrouille .
GABRIEL FOUQUET: Albert Albert se retourne .
ALBERT QUENTIN: Qu'est-ce qu ' y a encore ?
GABRIEL FOUQUET: Blangy , c'est pas possible .
GABRIEL FOUQUET: Chhhhut ! Il se rapproche de lui et parle plus bas .
ALBERT QUENTIN: La petite Marie ?
ALBERT QUENTIN: Et ben , on y va .
GABRIEL FOUQUET: Albert ! Albert se retourne .
ALBERT QUENTIN: Je peux pas y aller comme ça .
ALBERT QUENTIN: Ta-la-la la-laaa

GABRIEL FOUQUET: C'est peut-être que j'ai la langue chargée . Retour sur Albert .
GABRIEL FOUQUET: Albert !
ALBERT QUENTIN: Quoi ?
GABRIEL FOUQUET: Regarde !
ALBERT QUENTIN: Ah ! . Ah ! Ah !
GABRIEL FOUQUET: Hé , Albert , hé , me laisse pas ! Albert !
ALBERT QUENTIN: Oh ! Oh ! Gabriel se rétablit sur le sol .
ALBERT QUENTIN: Ah ! Enfin ! Ah ben , dis donc !
GABRIEL FOUQUET: Ah , ben voilà ! Albert se met à crier
GABRIEL FOUQUET: Arrête !
ALBERT QUENTIN: Quoi ?
GABRIEL FOUQUET: Ils envoient un plénipotentiaire .
ALBERT QUENTIN: Ah ben , c'est pas trop tôt .
ALBERT QUENTIN: Mission exceptionnelle !
GABRIEL FOUQUET: Elle croit parler à ses niards ?
GEORGETTE: Le papa ?
GABRIEL FOUQUET: C'est moi .
GEORGETTE: C'est nouveau , ça !
GABRIEL FOUQUET: Pas tellement , non .
ALBERT QUENTIN: Attention , les minutes tournent !
MADAME VICTORIA: I I do n't understand . What do you mean ?
GABRIEL FOUQUET: Gaspille pas tes dons . Madame est française .
GABRIEL FOUQUET: Elle a dit à demain .
ALBERT QUENTIN: Mais c'est Fachoda ! Gabriel se lève .
GABRIEL FOUQUET: Dis donc , si on envisageait un repli ?
ALBERT QUENTIN: Mais pourquoi pas une retraite ?
GEORGETTE: Bien , monsieur Quentin , on transmettra .
ALBERT QUENTIN: Toujours . Quelle belle nuit , hein ? Gabriel s'arrête .
ALBERT QUENTIN: Landru !
ALBERT QUENTIN: Embrasse-moi , mec !
GABRIEL FOUQUET: Albert
ALBERT QUENTIN: Quoi ? Gabriel soulève une caisse de fusées .
LANDRU: Rien !
L'OFFICIER ANGLAIS: Splendid !
LUCIEN ESNAULT: Ça vient de par là .
MADAME ESNAULT: Lucien ! Fais attention ! Où vas-tu ?
LANDRU: Une verte maintenant , Quentin ! La fusée part .
LANDRU: A vos chandelles romaines !
ALBERT QUENTIN: A nos morts !
GABRIEL FOUQUET: A nos morts !
GABRIEL FOUQUET: La Puerta del Sol !
ALBERT QUENTIN: Et la fête continue !
LANDRU: Ils ont amené les guignols ! Contre champ sur la foule et les gendarmes .
ALBERT QUENTIN: Joli temps pour les artilleurs !
GABRIEL FOUQUET: Aimable barbiflore , passez-moi les pétards ! Landru désigne une caisse .
LANDRU: Là , dans la caisse . C'est dans la boite . Gabriel se penche sur la caisse .
GABRIEL FOUQUET: Puisque vous n'avez rien de mieux .
GABRIEL FOUQUET: On va tâcher de faire avec . Il prend des fusées dans la caisse .
ALBERT QUENTIN: Qu'est-ce qu ' y a là-bas dedans ? Il désigne quelque chose du doigt .
LANDRU: Attention ! Ça pète ! Il désigne la foule .
LANDRU: Chacun pour soi . Moi , je vais me baigner .
GABRIEL FOUQUET: Qu'est-ce qu'on fait ?
GABRIEL FOUQUET: Vous allez toujours à Blangy ? Albert sort du blockhaus .
MARIE FOUQUET: Papa ! Que je suis contente !
GABRIEL FOUQUET: Mais bien sûr que te t'emmène .
MARIE FOUQUET: Dis donc , tu piques ! Albert se rapproche de Suzanne .
ALBERT QUENTIN: Ben oui , oh
MARIE FOUQUET: Au revoir , madame Quentin . Elle lui serre la main .
SUZANNE QUENTIN: Au revoir , ma petite Marie .
GABRIEL FOUQUET: Au revoir , madame , merci pour tout .
SUZANNE QUENTIN: Je t'attends mardi au train de six heures ?
ALBERT QUENTIN: Ben , bien sûr .
SUZANNE QUENTIN: T'oubliera pas ton changement à Lisieux ?
ALBERT QUENTIN: Tss-tss ! N'aie pas peur .
MARIE FOUQUET: C'est où que tu changes de train ?
ALBERT QUENTIN: Ben , ça va pas tarder .
GABRIEL FOUQUET: Au revoir .
GABRIEL FOUQUET: Je pense qu'il en a vu au moins un . ANNONCE
SALESWOMAN: This is Mr. Mathison . He 's a doctor .
DR. MATHISON: You okay ?
SALESWOMAN: An ambulance is on the way .
DR. MATHISON: Is there a name yet ? Beat . The woman smiles for the first time .
WOMAN: Elijah .
DR. MATHISON: What happened during the delivery ?
OLDER SALESWOMAN: Nothing . It was very quick . The baby just wanted to come ight out . There was no problems .
DR. MATHISON: Did you drop him ?
OLDER SALESWOMAN: Jesus Christ , no . The BABY SCREAMS .
DR. MATHISON: Please inform the ambulance we have a situation Dr. Mathison turns back to the mother . Beat .
DAVID: Someone left these . You want one ?
WOMAN: It 's my field . I represent athletes . I 'm an agent .
DAVID: What a coincidence ? I 'm a male synchronized swimme and I 'm looking fo epresentation . WOMAN Is that right ?
WOMAN: I 'm meeting a player from Temple University . He 's a cornerback . You like football ? Beat .
DAVID: Not really .
WOMAN: This kid is six foot two , two hundred and forty pounds . He runs the fifty in under six seconds . He 's going to be a God .
DAVID: I 'm David Dunne . The woman looks up .
WOMAN: Kelly . She goes back to the magazine . Beat .
DAVID: How long are you staying in Philly ?
KELLY: Sorry . DAVID What are you talking about ? An awkward silence .
DAVID: I think you got the wrong idea .
KELLY: I 'm going to find anothe seat .
MEGAN: You okay , Virginia ? Beat . VIRGINIA shakes her head , `` No . ''
DAVID: Okay . He FLASHES A LIGHT in David 's eyes .
JEREMY: I told you !
MEGAN: Not a lot .
JEREMY: Let 's go home .
DAVID: I do n't think I got the jo in New York .
MEGAN: What does that mean ?
DAVID: I 'm still going to New York . Just not this second .
MEGAN: I do n't want to drag this out too long for Jeremy .
DAVID: I know . Beat .
MEGAN: It stopped being our room a long time ago . You should go up and get some rest .
DAVID: Jeremy , why do n't you go sleep with your mom ? JEREMY I want to sleep here tonight .
MOTHER: We 'll play the water pistol game next . Elijah nods , `` Yes '' happily .
ELIJAH: I wo n't get hurt momma ! I 'm safe !
PRIEST: Sarah Elaston , social worke at Broad and Locust Community Center . We pray for your soul . Kevin Elliott , business man , father of six . We pray fo your soul . Glen Stevens , researcher in the area of Leukemia at Drexel University . We pray for your soul .
DAVID: I used to play football in college . In my first year as quarterback , we went on this winning streak . It just went on and on . It did n't matte who we played I 'd always win . You get superstitious when something like that happens . You give things meaning . Like you wear the same colo socks each game or you listen to the same B.B . King song before you leave the apartment . I would n't even untie the shoelaces on my cleats . I 'd just slip them on and off so nothing would change I gave things meaning that had no meaning . I 'm here to make sure I 'm not making shoelaces into something they 're not again . I was the only person to survive that accident . The only one It feels like it means something . Beat .
PRIEST: Are you a religious man , David ? David nods , `` No . ''
DAVID: Okay . Beat . The priest turns to David .
PRIEST: It was luck . Beat .
DAVID: What do you mean ?
PRIEST: Luck Random Without meaning . David just sits awkwardly .
ANCIENT SECRETARY: Yes ?
DAVID: Is Noel in ?
ANCIENT SECRETARY: No sir he is not . I read about you in the paper .
DAVID: Oh .
ANCIENT SECRETARY: I was in an accident once too . A horse almost trampled me to death .
DAVID: Wow .
ANCIENT SECRETARY: I had to put him down . Beat .
DAVID: That 's a sad story . Do you think you could ask Noel something for me ?
ANCIENT SECRETARY: Proceed .
DAVID: Ask if he can check how many sick days I 've taken since I 've worked here ? Beat .
ANCIENT SECRETARY: Is that the entire message ?
DAVID: Yes .
FATHER: Yeah Jerry why do n't you think about the fat ass turtles Like your fat ass son on the field jeopardizing the rest of ou chances at a fucking championship .
DAVID: Hey Noel . Beat . He just stares .
NOEL: Forty dollars . David turns on the bench .
DAVID: What ?
NOEL: You 're getting a forty dollar raise per week that 's it . Silence .
ELIJAH'S MOTHER: No more sitting in this oom . I 've let it go on long enough .
ELIJAH: I 'm not going out anymore . I 'm not getting hurt again . This was the last time . I told you .
ELIJAH'S MOTHER: You ca n't do anything about that . You might fall between that chair and this television . If that 's what God has planned for you , that 's what 's going to happen . You ca n't hide from it in your room .
ELIJAH: They call me Mr. Glass at school . Cause I break like glass . Elijah 's face is tense . Unyielding . Beat .
ELIJAH'S MOTHER: You make this decision now to be afraid And you 'll never turn back your whole life . You 'll always be afraid .
ELIJAH: Why ?
ELIJAH'S MOTHER: Forget why . Do you want it or not ? Elijah thinks it over . He nods , `` Yes . ''
ELIJAH: Where is it ?
ELIJAH'S MOTHER: On a bench , across the street . Elijah looks at his mother with disbelief .
ELIJAH: Someone 's gon na take it . Beat .
ELIJAH'S MOTHER: Then you better get out there soon .
MAN: This is from Fritz Champion 's own library . This is before the first issue of the comic book hit the stands in 1968 .
ELIJAH: It 's a classic depiction of good versus evil . Notice the square jaw of Slayer - common in most comic book heroes . And the slightly disproportionate size of Jaguaro 's body to his head . This again is common , but only in villains The thing to notice about this piece The thing that makes it very , very special is its realistic depiction of its figures . When the characters eventually made it into the magazine they were exaggerated as always happens . This is vintage .
BUSINESS MAN: Wrap it up .
ELIJAH: You 've made a considerably wise decision .
BUSINESS MAN: My kid 's gon na go berserk .
ELIJAH: Once again please ?
BUSINESS MAN: My son Jeb . It 's a gift fo him .
ELIJAH: How old is Jeb ?
BUSINESS MAN: Four .
ELIJAH: No .
BUSINESS MAN: What did I say ?
ELIJAH: Do you see any Telletubbies around here ? Do you see a slender plastic tag clipped to my shirt with my name printed on it ? Do you see a little Asian child with a blank expression sitting outside in a mechanical helicopter that shakes when you put a quarter in it ? No ? Well that 's what you see at a toy store ? Any you must think this is a toy store , cause you 're in here shopping for an infant named Jeb . One of us has made a gross error and wasted the other person 's valuable time Elijah 's eyes pierce through the shaken man .
BUSINESS MAN: What if I kept it ? Beat .
ELIJAH: I 'm listening .
BUSINESS MAN: I 'll keep it in my office oom .
ELIJAH: What about Jeb ?
BUSINESS MAN: I have a lock on the door . Elijah just stares .
ELIJAH: Will it be near a window ?
BUSINESSMAN: No direct sunlight will fall on it . Elijah eyes the man for many seconds . Beat .
ELIJAH: Come back in three days . I 'll think about it .
MAN: I received a card from you store .
ELIJAH: Congratulations , you have a mailbox The sale is n't for two weeks .
MAN: This one was under the windshield of my car .
ELIJAH: You 've never been sick ?
DAVID: I do n't know for sure . I do n't think so .
ELIJAH: Well if this ai n't a riddle worthy of the Riddler ?
DAVID: Seventy-five percent .
ELIJAH: Seventy-five percent ? That 's not nearly good enough fo me . I 'm extremely skeptical .
DAVID: Skeptical about what ?
ELIJAH: Your answer to my question . It 's one thing to have neve een injured in your life , ut to state that you 've never taken ill , well that 's a whole new level .
JEREMY: Dad 's been injured . Beat .
ELIJAH: What 's he talking about ?
DAVID: In college . A car accident .
ELIJAH: Was it serious ? David nods .
JEREMY: He could n't play football anymore . Beat . Elijah looks shaken .
ELIJAH: I assumed because of the train .
DAVID: You assumed wrong .
ELIJAH: It 's over . You can go now .
DAVID: I think you skipped a couple steps . Elijah turns .
ELIJAH: The life of an idea that has lived too long in my head . David stares at Elijah impatiently .
DAVID: What was your idea Elijah ? Beat . ELIJAH If there is someone like me in the world , and I 'm at one end of the spectrum Could n't there be someone the opposite of me , at the other end ? A person who ca n't be hurt like the rest of us . A kind of person they were talking about in those stories . Elijah points at the framed comic sketches . ELIJAH A person they believed was put here to protect the rest of us . Guard us .
JEREMY: You thought my dad was a eal-
DAVID: Jeremy do n't take anothe sip of that drink .
ELIJAH: Technically no . I gambled that you would attend the church service . I just waited for you . David glares at Elijah .
DAVID: What 's this about ? This is obviously some scam . Is this where you tell me one of those pictures is like an investment ?
ELIJAH: You 've misunderstood .
DAVID: I see guys like you all the time in my work . You find someone you think is emotionally vulnerable and you tell them a fantastic story , utterly convincing and somewhere in there , you slip it in ' I just need your credit card number ' , ' I just need a small down payment . '
ELIJAH: What type of job do you have David ?
DAVID: I work at the stadium as a security guard .
WALKIE: Dunne , it 's Jenkins , we got a guy at gate 17C with a ogus ticket . Says he knows you . He wo n't tell me his name . DAVID What 's he look like ?
ELIJAH: They said I could n't get in with my ticket .
DAVID: It 's for last week 's game .
ELIJAH: I 've come to understand that An ill advised purchase in the parking lot . David hands Elijah back the ticket .
DAVID: What do you want ?
ELIJAH: Not money . But I appreciate you healthy cynicism in the manner . It will be wise fo oth of us to proceed with greatest caution .
DAVID: We 're not proceeding anywhere together .
ELIJAH: We 've already begun . David looks around .
DAVID: One more time . What is it you want ? Beat .
ELIJAH: Why is it , do you think , that of all the professions in the world you chose protection ?
DAVID: Are you for real ?
ELIJAH: You could have poured coffee in Starbucks , you could have learned to install track lighting in office uildings , you could have told people their horoscopes on the internet You could have been one of ten thousand things but in the end , you chose to protect people . You made that decision and I find that very , very interesting . Now all I need is you credit card number . Beat . Elijah smiles .
DAVID: I got this job because my college coach called the guy who manages the stadium . There 's no hidden meaning to it . David 's walkie makes NOIES on his hip .
ELIJAH: Is there a problem ?
DAVID: That guy in green . Sometimes people carry weapons in here . Then they drink too much . They 're team is n't doing so well , bad things happen We do random pat downs of the crowd to discourage people from carrying . If he 's carrying , he 'll step out of line .
ELIJAH: How did you know that man you bumped was carrying a weapon ?
DAVID: Probably the army jacket . Those guys carry hunting knives and stuff for show .
ELIJAH: You thought he was carrying a knife ? Beat .
DAVID: I thought he was carrying something .
ELIJAH: But not a knife ?
DAVID: I got this picture of a silver handled gun tucked in his pants . Like on t.v .
ELIJAH: You have good instincts when it comes to things like that ?
DAVID: Like what ?
ELIJAH: Telling when people have done something wrong ? Beat .
DAVID: Yes .
ELIJAH: Have you ever tried to develop it ?
DAVID: I do n't know what you 're asking ?
ELIJAH: You 're skill . Beat .
DAVID: Listen . I got to be on the sidelines during the game You can get to your seat by taking the stairwell at-
ELIJAH: Characters in comic books are often attributed special powers . X-ray vision , things of that sort . David exhales slowly as he stares at Elijah .
DAVID: Okay , I do n't want to play this game anymore .
ELIJAH: It 's an exaggeration of the truth . Maybe it 's based on something as simple as instinct . Like being able to touch someone and tell whether they 've done something wrong Or the level of what they 've done wrong .
DAVID: The guy might not have been carrying anything .
ELIJAH: Or he might have been carrying a silver handled gun tucked in his pants . David 's WALKIE ERUPTS WITH NOISE .
DAVID: I have to go now .
ELIJAH: One last question . Beat .
DAVID: Quick .
ELIJAH: The car accident you were in Was there anyone else involved ? The two men stand very still in the tunnel .
DAVID: Yes . My wife Megan . She was in the car with me .
JEREMY: Was it sold out ? David nods , `` No . ''
DAVID: You know how mad your mom would be if she knew you were playing football ? Jeremy nods .
JEREMY: Are you going to tell ? David nods , `` No . ''
DAVID: In under six seconds . I 've heard .
JEREMY: Just play one set of downs . I told them you were great .
DAVID: Why 'd you do that ?
JEREMY: Just one-
DAVID: Jeremy . I 'm going in . I have to do some things .
JEREMY: What things ?
DAVID: I 'm going to work out .
JEREMY: I 'll help you .
DAVID: There 's nothing to do . Jeremy turns back to the children and waves . JEREMY I ca n't play ! I 'm working out with my dad !
JEREMY: You think you could beat up Mike Tyson ? I mean before he started wiggin out and eating people 's ears ?
DAVID: No .
JEREMY: What if you worked out everyday for six months ? You think you could beat him then ?
DAVID: No .
JEREMY: What if you only ate foods that were good for you and you worked out everyday fo a year ?
DAVID: No .
JEREMY: How much can you lift ? David looks back at the weights .
DAVID: That 's the most I 've eve lifted . That could have been dangerous Jeremy . Why do n't you go upstairs and let me finish up ? Jeremy starts back to the barbell .
JEREMY: I 'll take it off . I 'll help you right . He slips off the safety collar .
DAVID: No .
JEREMY: I mean if you knew karate ?
DAVID: No Jeremy .
JEREMY: What if he was n't aloud to kick and you were really mad at him ?
DAVID: No .
JEREMY: I lied . Beat .
DAVID: You added ? Jeremy nods , `` Yes '' slowly .
JEREMY: More ? Beat . David nods , `` Yes . ''
DAVID: You should never try anything like this . You know that right ? Jeremy nods , `` Yes . ''
MEGAN: Not often , but it is possible . Most people get scared when they see the shadow of their limits . They do n't know how long the shadow really is . They do n't know how far away the real limits are standing They stop out of fear .
DAVID: What do I do when I 'm around someone I know ?
MEGAN: You use your sleeve . They both smile at each other . Beat . WOMAN Megan ?
WOMAN: I thought it was you .
MEGAN: Hi . This is Claire . Her son is in Jeremy 's class . Claire and I worked on the school food drive together .
DAVID: Hello .
CLAIRE: I 'm very happy about this . Megan mentioned to me she was considering dating again . Megan becomes still . CLAIRE I 'm sorry , what 's your name ? Beat . David does n't look up .
DAVID: David .
CLAIRE: David ?
MEGAN: This is my husband .
DAVID: Okay .
ELIJAH: They call me Mr. Glass . Beat . PHYSICIAN Who does ?
JANIS: Your ten o'clock is here . The hospital discharged him this morning .
MEGAN: Thanks .
ELIJAH: How long have you been married ?
MEGAN: Twelve years .
ELIJAH: How did you get together ?
MEGAN: A car accident . Elijah smiles even bigger .
ELIJAH: Now you 're going to have to tell me more .
MEGAN: See my husband was a big football star in college and we were in an accident together . Our car flipped on an icy road . We were both injured . He could n't play football anymore . If that had n't happened , we would n't have been together .
ELIJAH: How so ?
MEGAN: Football was n't the kind of life I wanted For ten years I 'd be by the phone waiting for a call telling me he broke his neck in a practice game . And if it was n't that call , it would e a call telling me he blew out his knee or suffered his third concussion . I 've seen way too much of it in my job I can barely take it when my clients are in pain . I do n't hate the game . I admire the amount of skill it involved and , like everyone else , I was in awe of how he could play it , but I could n't give him my heart and then have something happen to him . And it always does with that game . It 's not a thing many people would understand .
ELIJAH: You and my mother would have a special connection .
MEGAN: Any way , fate stepped in and took football out of the equation .
ELIJAH: And everyone lived happily ever after . Beat .
MEGAN: Sort of . Beat .
ELIJAH: What part of David 's body was injured ? Beat . Megan 's eyes become utterly still .
MEGAN: Who said my husband 's name is David ?
STOCKY WOMAN: Choose .
ELIJAH: There have been three majo disasters in this city ove the last four years . I 've followed each one of them A Seven-three-seven crashes on take off . One hundred and seventy-two die . No survivors A hotel fire downtown . Two hundred and eleven die . No survivors And am Amtrak train derails seven and half miles outside of the city . One hundred and thirty one die . One survivor . He is unharmed . I 've spoken with you husband about his survival . I suggested a rathe unbelievable explanation . Since then , I 've come to elieve , that my explanation , howeve unbelievable , is in fact , true .
MEGAN: And what was that explanation ? Beat .
ELIJAH: It 's a mediocre time Mrs. Dunne . People are starting to lose hope . It 's hard fo many to believe that extraordinary things live inside themselves as well as others I hope you can keep an open mind ? Beat . MEGAN Is this a religious thing ?
DAVID: We 've had some problems with drug selling in this stadium . Would you mind if I checked the pockets of you sweatshirt ?
THERMOMETER BOY: Is that your dad ? Jeremy nods `` Yes . ''
JEREMY: I do n't think so .
NURSE: No , he insisted we only call you . Though it took us a while to track down your number . It 's not on file here .
DAVID: Megan handles that type of stuff .
NURSE: What stuff is that ?
DAVID: Jeremy 's stuff .
NURSE: It 's more emotional damage . It was n't very serious physically . David nods .
DAVID: What was that ?
NURSE: My office was on the othe side of the building back then . You do n't remember me do you ? David nods , `` no . ''
DAVID: Yes I am .
JEREMY: Why do you keep saying that ?
MEGAN: He 's just laying in bed . He 's pretty upset . He wo n't talk .
DAVID: He 's dealing with a lot of things . I think he needs to find answers himself . Beat .
MEGAN: It 's weird to hear you tell me about Jeremy . A good weird .
DAVID: Would you like to try going-
MEGAN: Yes .
DAVID: -out again . Beat . David smiles .
MEGAN: Oh . Elijah Price came to visit me at the cente today .
DAVID: Jesus . Megan sees David 's shocked expression .
MEGAN: He did n't do anything . He just told me his theory It 's sad when patients get like that . They loose eality . DAVID Jeremy what the hell are you doing ?
DAVID: -Jeremy did you load that gun ? Jeremy nods , `` Yes . '' Crying harder now . JEREMY -You wo n't get hurt
MEGAN: -Sometimes when people are sick or hurt for a long time , like Elijah , they 're mind gets hurt too . David shoots a tense glance at Megan .
DAVID: -You know the story about the kid who almost drowned in the pool ? Jeremy stops moving .
MEGAN: -Jeremy , your father was injured in college - you know that . You know all about that .
DAVID: -Jeremy listen to what-
JEREMY: -Do n't be scared .
DAVID: -Jeremy if you pull that trigger I 'm going to leave ! I 'm going to go to New York .
ELIJAH: Joined a rugby league . Turned out to be a bad idea . Come here I want to show you something .
DAVID: Stop messing with my life Elijah . My son almost shot me last night . He wanted to prove you were right .
ELIJAH: I never said you could n't be killed . I never said that .

SOMOZA: I am busy ! Get out of here at once or I 'll put my foot up your ass !
HUB: Did he tell you about his parents in the graveyard , the flowers and all that ? Good , good
SOMOZA: My friends this gathering was not intended to be a press conference as much as a `` get-together '' but I have just been handed a piece of news . Somoza plays the moment with theatrical elan .
JOURNALISTS: Mr. President ! Mr. President !
SOMOZA: Please my friends no questions . A press release is being prepared .
OTHER JOURNALIST: They got Rafael ? You believe that ?
REGIS: Every six months Tacho gives this speech maybe they finally lucked out .
JAZY: Russell , excuse me but I 've just een put in a rather embarrassing position . Mrs. Somoza would like her picture taken with Miss Panama . In color ?
PRICE: How the hell could Tacho find Rafael .
JAZY: Russell , please I have my hands full
MRS. SOMOZA: Tacho , Tacho venga , por favor !
PRICE: Is Tacho lying again ? They did kill him , did n't they ?
JAZY: Everybody smile .
PRICE: One more , please ! Una mas , por favor ?
JAZY: What do you need ?
PRICE: Is Rafael alive or dead ?
JAZY: I do n't know .
PRICE: Just one more thank you . I thought you knew everything ?
JAZY: What do I know , eh ? Tacho needs a victory very badly he needs to prove to Jimmy Carter that he is still winning . He thinks Rafael 's death is the proof he needs .
PRICE: Carter do n't need proof . He just sent twenty-five million in new arms to Tacho . I 'm sorry almost got it here .
JAZY: No , no the arms shipment has been delayed in New Orleans because Jimmy is getting nervous .
PRICE: The State Department 's gon na pull the plug on Tacho ? ! Pardon my French ut whose fucking side are you on ?
JAZY: I work for everybody . If there is a transition of power , I facilitate a relationship with the new people . If there is not , I facilitate the status quo . Either way , I facilitate .
PRICE: Great job .
JAZY: I send messages to Jimmy and I tell him that the Revolution is a flood that can not be stopped but it can be controlled nobody listens I ca n't even get a little water in my pool .
PRICE: Rough ai n't it . Thank you everybody , very nice .
JAZY: They say he 's very handsome . It would make a wonderful picture , eh ? The two men share a smile .
PRICE: Con permiso who controls what today ?
CLAIRE: How do we find the guerillas ?
REGIS: What 'd he say ?
CLAIRE: Go two or three blocks and turn right at the sniper .
PRICE: You can drop us off .
REGIS: We 're not looking for the guerillas .
CLAIRE: Then let us out . The car stops , the door opens , and
SOLDIER: Lo siento !
PRICE: Go one more block .
CLAIRE: He just wanted to see credentials , for crissakes , what 're doing ?
REGIS: You want to drive ?
PRICE: We want out !
PRICE: Periodista , periodista , periodista !
BOY: Busca triquitraques ?
CLAIRE: Si .
BOY: Venga . They follow him up a hill .
ISELA: You are looking for Rafael ?
PRICE: Yeah . If it 's possible .
CLAIRE: Do you know why we 're here exactly ?
ISELA: Mr. Price does n't do anything before announcing it first in the bar . It 's a good story . You 'll be more famous .
CLAIRE: Rafael 's tent ?
ISELA: Venga , companeros .
CLAIRE: What is it ? Price looks around , speaks quietly .
PRICE: Rafael is dead .
CLAIRE: I do n't know .
ISELA: Venga por favor ! Alli !
CLAIRE: What 're you talking about ?
PRICE: He 's dead . I know it .
CLAIRE: Then why did they bring us all the way here to see him ? He does n't know .
ISELA: This is Commandante Cinco . They all shake hands . Isela begins at once .
COMMANDANTE CINCO: Queremos un fotografia .
ISELA: We need a photograph . Come with us .
COMMANDANTE CINCO: Usted es un fotografo magnifico . Queremos que vive . Price laughs the request is ridiculous .
ISELA: Why is he laughing ?
PRICE: You 're crazy .
CINCO: We have momentum , but many more lives will be lost . Even Washington is starting to admit that the butche Somoza is not loved by his people . They have detained twenty-five million dollars in new arms shipments fo Somoza at an airfield in Florida until they find out if Rafael is alive or dead . We know about these things . He pauses briefly .
CLAIRE: If Washington thinks Rafael is dead , they will ship the arms to Somoza . Do you understand .
PRICE: Yeah . Commandante Soy un periodista . CINCO attacks that defense with new vigor .
CINCO: This has nothing to do with journalism there is more to the world than journalism . We are going to end this war with you or without you . People do n't really believe in Rafael they believe in the idea of Rafael , no ? Because for now the idea of Rafael is enough for the people of Nicaragua . When the war is over none of this matters .
PRICE: I do n't do things like this .
CINCO: Enough lives have been lost already . It 's difficult , I know but you must do it .
CLAIRE: I spend my whole life separating how I feel from how I think and what I see from what I say that 's called journalism , is n't it ? He nods slightly .
PRICE: Or when you 're in bed .
CLAIRE: Yes ! My job is to find a story , then tell a story whatever it is because I believe that if enough people hea enough stories then somehow , through information alone , we all have a etter chance to survive . I believe in information . That 's a very romantic streak I have unning through me maybe it 's a weakness . Information is good lack of information is bad . Simple , eh ?
PRICE: Not so simple .
CLAIRE: You 're God damn right it 's not . You take that picture you 'll take it for all the right reasons I understand .
PRICE: I 'm not gon na take it . He fiddles with the cameras .
CLAIRE: That 's fine for you . But do I go ack and say I interviewed Rafael ? Do I go back and say I missed the iggest story of the war ? Or do I say Rafael was stone cold dead that 's the information , is n't it ? O do I say he entertained us all in his inimitably charismatic manne around the ol ' revolutionary campfire ? Can we throw up our arms and say we fell in love with the querillas ecause their cause was sympathetic ? Journalists do n't fall in love . Which story do you want me to tell ? Silence .
PRICE: Do what you want to do .
CLAIRE: Christ , what the fuck are we doing here ?
PRICE: I want to be here . With you . What do you want . Silence .
CLAIRE: I want this war to end . I 'm not going to tell the world that Rafael is dead .
PRICE: I love you .
CLAIRE: I think I love you .
PRICE: Do n't think so much .

PRICE: Fabulous . Unsure silence .
CLAIRE: Why are you back ?
ALEX: I came back because of Russell .
PRICE: Because of me ?
ALEX: Yeah the whole fucking East Coast is falling in love with Rafael they were sure he was dead this time . Somebody wants to do a musical about him and his mug 's on every T-shirt in Central Park .
CLAIRE: You look good . Things 're okay ?
ALEX: I 'm happier in New York , sure , things are great . You guys ?
PRICE: Terrific now I 'm a little slow here , Alex what exactly did you come back for ?
ALEX: It 's a great story . I want to talk to Rafael and you 're the only man in the world that can take me to him .
HUB: Alex ! Could n't stay away , eh ?
CLAIRE: We 've got to tell Alex what happened .
PRICE: No way .
CLAIRE: I 'll tell him . He deserves to know .
PRICE: We do n't owe him anything !
CLAIRE: We owe him that ! He got you started in this business he covered for your missed deadlines and made excuses for you unprofessional attitude before the world fell in love with you pictures Before kids fresh out of journalism school were rushing off to any wa they could to interview bullets and take pictures of bodies like Price ! He took care of you before you were hot !
PRICE: He would n't understand .
CLAIRE: Before Nicaragua you would n't understand . I 'm not sure I exactly understand . What are we going to do ?
PRICE: I 'll take Alex to find Rafael we 'll go to Sebaco on the road to Matagalpa the Guardia heavily control the area and they 're scared ight now they 'll never let us through . We wo n't be able to get near Rafael . Alex will understand and we 'll turn around and drive back without a story .
CLAIRE: That 's a lie !
PRICE: Tell me about lies !
CLAIRE: I do n't want to tell him either .
PRICE: We may not be able to find him , y'know
ALEX: I 've got supreme confidence in you .
PRICE: Everybody looks good in the tropics .
ALEX: Since I have n't been able to find Isela since coming back , you 're going to have to translate for me what the hell does that mean ? Price is nervous , wired , on edge .
PRICE: Alex I love her .
ALEX: And she 'thinks ' she loves you .
PRICE: It 's past the thinking stage .
ALEX: I 'd like to know something it probably does n't matter in the great final scheme of things but I 'm interested Did you ever lay a hand on her before she left me ?
PRICE: No !
ALEX: That 's the truth ?
PRICE: Yes ! Alex we 're friends ! There is something desperate in his voice .
SOLDIER: Venga .
ALEX: I bet you go through a few rental cars .
PRICE: Do n't worry . I put this in your name .
OATES: No pictures , eh ? Might look bad .
PRICE: You get paid by the body or by the hour ?
OATES: I get paid the same way you do . What the fuck you doin ' in Sebaco this place 's about to blow ai n't it ?
PRICE: You did n't have to nail Pedro .
OATES: Who 's Pedro ?
ALEX: Oh my God
OATES: There 's a motherfucking war goin ' on , pal lotta sad stories .
PRICE: Why them ? Why them ? !
OATES: I do n't suck no dick , man
ALEX: Russell , let 's get outta here .

OATES: Guy 's got a sense of humor , old man . Got any dope ? Tough place to find decent dope ?
PRICE: Why them ?
OATES: Them ? C'mere . You too .
ALEX: Who gives you the pictures ?
OATES: What 's this , an interview ? I ai n't that dumb . Price turns , he does n't want to face it .
ALEX: Off the record .
OATES: Off the record some pachuco gives 'em to me . Ai n't none of my business , ut I heard he gets 'em from a Frog .
PRICE: She dead ?
OATES: Not yet .
PRICE: Some-motherfucker-took-my-fucking- pictures-I-don't-fucking-know-what- happened ! Fuck me ! Silence .
ALEX: Did n't you ship the film to New York ?
PRICE: I developed it in my room . Jesus Christ , Alex ? ! Silence . The car races .
ALEX: Slow down . It was n't your fault if somebody stole your stuff
PRICE: It was .
ALEX: What about Rafael ?

CLAIRE: You think our flags are big enough ?
PRICE: This is what I want to show you .
ALEX: We drove through three roadblocks a half hour before curfew so you could show me a statue of Tacho .
PRICE: It 's not Tacho . It 's Mussolini . Tacho went to Italy to commission a statue of himself , he found a warehouse full of Il Duces on horseback , got a great deal on one of 'em brought it back and switched heads . Ya ca n't tell , can ya ?
ALEX: What the hell are you talking about ?
CLAIRE: I think what he 's trying to say what we 're trying to say is that things are n't exactly what they seem to be .
ALEX: Well , they do n't `` seem '' to be that great so I ca n't wait for this one Hey , here we are ! Two guys in the tropics in love with the same dame ullets flying !

ALEX: You saw too many bodies ? That 's a lot of bodies . You stupid son of a bitch . Did he talk you into it ?
CLAIRE: No ! I wanted Rafael to be alive .
ALEX: In some way I understand him doing it , I do n't like it but I understand but you ?

MUCHACHO #1: Periodistas ! Take this picture ! I 'm going to blow his head off .
JAZY: Somoza ? He is a tyrant too , of course . A butcher . But finally that is not the point , you see . If we wish to survive we have a choice of tyrants , and fo all the right reasons , your poets choose the wrong side .
MUCHACHO #1: Fotografia !
PRICE: No .
JAZY: Yes . Your picture of Rafael was illiant but I am alive , and etter looking . A good looking Frenchman with a sympathetic face is murdered in cold blood while fighting for the survival of Europe and America . You will have another magazine cover ! Muy complicado , no ?

DOCTOR: Journalist ? You knew the man who was killed ? Fifty thousand Nicaraguans have died and now one Yankee . Perhaps now Americans will be outraged at what is happening here , eh ? It takes a while for Claire to respond .
CLAIRE: Yes perhaps they will .
DOCTOR: Maybe we should have killed an American journalist fifty years ago .
CLAIRE: Have you seen La Guardia ?
CHILD: Tanquettas ! Tanquettas !

MARTIN: I I did n't do it . Jurgen studies him , hard . Looks back at Gina .
JURGEN: You said you had something .
MARTIN: These numbers , are a code . The first number refers to the page of a given book . The second to a specific line on that page . The third number to words on that line . If I did n't have the exact edition of the book , the code would be unbreakable .
JURGEN: And what do the numbers refer to ?
MARTIN: That 's where it breaks down the words are the Latin names of two plant species Calochortus Albus and Umbellularia Californica . Fairy Lantern and California Bay . Both common flowering plants
JURGEN: Not part of your work ? O Professor Bressler 's ?

MARTIN: Correct . Yes . Look
JURGEN: Did you ever know someone called Laurence Darnell ?
SHRUGS: Fahad 's sponsoring the Forum , Bressler 's the keynote speaker .
JURGEN: So they 're not close ?
MARTIN: In a way they 're opposites . Bressler wants to end world hunger . Open research universal access to all his data on crop cultivation
JURGEN: But Fahad 's just a businessman .
MARTIN: They 're both progressives . Fahad knows we 'll need food long afte oil . New agricultural patents are worth billions
JURGEN: But his progressiveness has cost him his own people hate him the attempts on his life
MARTIN: He 's got balls , that 's for sure .
JURGEN: There 's a cocktail party , before Bressler 's speech tonight ?
MARTIN: It 's in our suite . Champagne and hors d'oeuvres for Bressler and a few of his guests .
JURGEN: Is Fahad going to be there ?
MARTIN: Yes . Bressler invited him Martin trails off . Starting to get there
JURGEN: Martin Harris with just a few guests , in a confined space with Prince Fahad . For some , that might be a very good reason to want to be you .

MARTIN B: Dr. Harris speaking .
GERMAN ACCENT: Yes , hello , Dr. Harris . This is Else Adlam from Dr. Bressler 's office . Dr. Bressler was wondering if you might be able to meet with him today
MARTIN: Yes , hello , this is Dr. Harris . I have a message for Dr. Bressler
GINA: Why here ?
MARTIN: .The zoo . She loves Pola Bears . I never knew exactly why .
GINA: Okay , go . You 're going to be late for your date .
MARTIN: This should n't take long . I just need to see what Bressler wants .
LIZ: Take your time , I want to see the zoo anyway .
BRESSLER: I thought we might have a table for three , in case you still had your alter ego with you .
MARTIN B: No , thank God . I assume he 's safely back in the hospital .
BRESSLER: Well , it 's a lesson . You neve know what people will do . All my work used to be on-line , my e- mails on an open server . A yea ago , someone broke into my office and stole my computer . I believe they were after my research . Luckily , I split my data up and double encrypt it until I put it all together and make it public . That 's why this stays with me until tonight 's over Martin B nods , starts to look at his menu
MARTIN B: I hope you can forgive me . It was something you said
BEAT: .It 's been tormenting me .
BRESSLER: No ! God NO ! You 're focusing on the science , but this .this is history . You open the esearch before it 's finished , the conglomerates gobble it up . In the entire history of human development , name me one time when business has ever acted except in its own self-interest .
MARTIN B: I 'm sorry , it 's my fault . Another appointment I forgot .
BRESSLER: It does n't matter . But see you , you say I am too cautious . It 's an idiot thing to say . I 'm a realist !
MARTIN B: I 'm sorry if I offended you , Dr. Bressler . I just
BRESSLER: Do n't be stupid . You ca n't offend me . We are colleagues , this is good discussion . But please , Dr. Harris Power is an animal , all to itself . It adapts , mutates to whatever form will best preserve it . It 's always closer than we know . ON MARTIN B , extending a hand
MARTIN B: .Perhaps you 're right .
LIZ: What are you doing here ?
MARTIN: Liz . What 's happening ?
LIZ: You 're crazy you have to leave me alone .
MARTIN: Why ? I have to know why , Liz . Are they making you do this ? Are they threatening you ?
LIZ: .How did you find me
MARTIN: The zoo . The Polar Bears .

JURGEN: Quite by chance , as it happens .
COLE: Sounds like he was damn lucky . So , what can I do to help ?
JURGEN: Come with us to the authorities . Help them confirm his identity .
COLE: The authorities ? Jesus , it 's that bad ? A guy comes to you with a story like that . What made you take the case ?
JURGEN: Curiosity
COLE: Curiosity ? Is that all ?
JURGEN: Professional curiosity . There 's not much in this world left to interest an old spy like me
COLE: You had fifteen minutes after I called . Why did n't you run ?
JURGEN: Where would I run from Section 15 , Mr. Cole ? I can hardly walk .
COLE: I want to know how he found you . I want every number , every source you 've contacted on his behalf .
JURGEN: And then what ? We shake hands and you go away ? Cole reaches a hand inside his jacket
COLE: But we do . The best of us .
JURGEN: Tell me if he remembers everything . What then ?
WOMAN: May I see some identification ? She looks up . Martin 's expression distant

MARTIN: Gina stops , turns . A beat . Sadness , anger .
GINA: One kiss and suddenly Everything that 's happened ? To Biko ? To us ? I know , she 's your wife . Like I said , I 'm an idiot .

DUG: My master made me this collar . He is a good and smart master and he made me this collar so that I may talk SQUIRREL ! !
CARL: It 's not possible .
DUG: Oh it is , because my master is smart .
RUSSELL: Cool ! What do these do , boy ?
DUG: Hey would you-
CLICK: -cuerdo con tigo-
CARL: Russell , do n't touch that . It could e radioactive or something .
DUG: I am a great tracker . My pack sent me on a special mission all by myself . Have you seen a bird ? I want to find one and I have been on the scent . I am a great tracker , did I mention that ? BAM ! The bird tackles Dug and HISSES .

GAMMA: I 'm getting prunes and denture cream ! Who are they ?
BETA: Ah man , Master will not be pleased . We 'd better tell him someone took the bird , right Alpha ?
ALPHA: No . Soon enough the bird will be ours yet again .
BETA: Hey Alpha , I think there 's something wrong with your collar . You must have bumped it .
GAMMA: Yeah , your voice sounds funny !
ALPHA: Beta . Gamma . Mayhaps you desire to SQUIRREL !
BETA: No no . But maybe Dug would . You might want to ask him .
GAMMA: Yeah , I wonder if he 's found the ird on his very special mission .
ALPHA: Do not mention Dug to me at this time . His fool 's errand will keep him most occupied , most occupied indeed . Ha ha ha . Do you not agree with that which I am saying to you now ?
BETA: Sure , but the second Master finds out you sent Dug out by himself , none of us will get a treat .
ALPHA: You are wise , my trusted Lieutenant .
DUG: Hi Alpha . Hey , your voice sounds funny .
ALPHA: I know , I know ! Have you seen the ird ?

RUSSELL: Well , he 's away a lot . I do n't see him much .
CARL: He 's got to be home sometime .
RUSSELL: Well , I called , but Phyllis told me I bug him too much .

RUSSELL: Phyllis is n't my mom . Carl realizes he put his foot in it .
CARL: Oh .

CARL: Hey , uh , why do n't you get some sleep . Do n't want to wake up the traveling flea circus .
RUSSELL: Mr. Fredricksen , Dug says he wants to take Kevin prisoner . We have to protect him !
CARL: Alright . He can come .
RUSSELL: Promise you wo n't leave him ?

NOSEY NEIGHBOR: We 've been trying to get a vote on the new landscaping . Can I e-mail you the plans ? We 'd love to get a final tally .
RYAN: It 's fine . Really . I 'll go with the majority .
NOSEY NEIGHBOR: Sometimes I forget that you even live here . You could probably save money and move into a hotel .
RYAN: I looked into it , but the IRS equires a permanent address fo employment . Otherwise , they classify you as a vagrant .
NOSEY NEIGHBOR: Oh .
WOMAN'S VOICE: Hey neighbor .

ASIDE: Sorry , Ned . I 'm sure H.R . will hire you back this afternoon .
NED: I do n't understand . I 'm fired ?
NATALIE: Hearing the words `` You 've been let go '' is never easy . Change is always scary . But consider the following - Anybody who ever built an empire , or changed the world , sat where you are now . And it 's because they sat there that they were able to do it .
RYAN: That 's my fucking line .
NED: Well , what happens now ?
NATALIE: This is the first step of a process that will end with you in a new jo that fulfills you .
NED: Yeah , but , how does it work ?
NATALIE: I want you to take that packet in front of you .
NED: I understand .
NATALIE: Have a good day , Mr. Laskin and good luck with your future .
NED: Thank you .
NATALIE: Give it up for Ned .
RYAN: Tell me you 're not taking this seriously .

RYAN: It does n't make any sense . It 's
SEARCHING: completely impersonal .
CRAIG GREGORY: Who am I even talking to ?
RYAN: There 's a methodology to what I do . A reason why it works .
CRAIG GREGORY: Ryan , Coke and IBM have been doing it for years . Just like anything , there 's a few months of transition , ut everyone settles in .
RYAN: Who are you taking off the road ?
CRAIG GREGORY: You do n't get it . You 're grounded , Ryan . Everyone is . It 's done .
RYAN: Okay , what we do here is brutal and leaves people devastated , but there 's a dignity to the way I do it .
CRAIG GREGORY: Stabbing people in the chest instead of the back ?
NATALIE: You wanted to see me ?
RYAN: Yeah , why do n't you come in .
CRAIG GREGORY: Great job in there , Nat .
NATALIE: Thank you . How 's everyone taking it ?
RYAN: Look , I appreciate your zeal . And you have some good ideas . But you know nothing of the realities of my job . Sure , you can set up an iChat ut you do n't know how people think .
NATALIE: Actually , I minored in psychology .
CRAIG GREGORY: Nice .
RYAN: Okay kiddo , fire me .
CRAIG GREGORY: Ryan , stop it .
RYAN: She 's going to be doing this on a egular basis . You do n't want to know if she can fire somebody ?
CRAIG GREGORY: She just fired Ned .
RYAN: My dog could fire Ned .
TO NATALIE: Fire me .
CRAIG GREGORY: Ryan .
NATALIE: It 's okay , I got this .
RYAN: Who the hell are you ?
NATALIE: My name is Miss Keener and I 'm here today to discuss your future .
RYAN: My future ? I do n't know you . The only person who can fire me is Craig Gregory .
NATALIE: Mr. Gregory hired me to handle this for him .
RYAN: Handle what ? Handle me ? Mr. Gregory hired me and he 's the only one who can fire me . I 'm going to talk to him .
NATALIE: Mr. Bingham
RYAN: You ca n't follow me You 're on a computer screen . Remember ?
NATALIE: Ryan
RYAN: Try again . Fire me .

RYAN: Actually , you did n't . Now , fire me .
CRAIG GREGORY: Stop it , Ryan .
NATALIE: Mr. Bingham , I 'm here today to inform you that your position is no longer available .
RYAN: I 'm fired ?
NATALIE: Yes , you 're fired .
RYAN: Never say fired .
NATALIE: You 've been let go .
RYAN: Why ?
NATALIE: This is a mythical situation . How could I possibly know why ?
RYAN: You never know why . Why does n't matter .
NATALIE: It 's important not to focus on the `` why '' and rather to spend you energy thinking about your future .
RYAN: I 'm going to spend my energy on suing you if you do n't give me a eason that you 're firing me .
NATALIE: Mr. Bingham , the reason is not important .
RYAN: Oh , so you 're firing me without grounds .
TO CRAIG: Now , I really have a lawsuit .
CRAIG GREGORY: Ryan , I think we know what you 're trying to say
NATALIE: Do n't take this personally , Mr. Bingham .
RYAN: Personally ? This is the most personal situation you will ever enter . So before you try to revolutionize my business , I 'd like to know that you actually know my business .
CRAIG GREGORY: Hell-of-a-way to welcome her to the team .
RYAN: Am I the only one who sees that by automating our own business , we 're making ourselves irrelevant .
CRAIG GREGORY: No We 're making you irrelevant .
A BEAT: Watch yourself , Ryan . You 're too young to be a dinosaur
RYAN: I 'm not I 'm not a dinosaur .
CRAIG GREGORY: I want you to show her the ropes .
RYAN: What do I know about what happens around here ? Have Ferguson do it .
CRAIG GREGORY: I 'm not talking about here .
RYAN: No .
CRAIG GREGORY: Hey , you seem pretty confident that this girl does n't know what she 's doing
RYAN: Excuse me . I just do n't think a MySpace page qualifies you to ewire an entire company .
CRAIG GREGORY: Great . Well , here 's your chance . Show her the magic . Take he through the paces .
RYAN: I 'm not a fucking tour guide .
CRAIG GREGORY: This is the boat .
RYAN: Yes . Alone .
CRAIG GREGORY: Ryan , we 're ringing the bell . Rounding everybody up . If you want to stay out there a little longer , you can . But you 're not going to be on your own . Let me know .
RYAN: Huh .
NATALIE: What ?
RYAN: That 's exactly what it is . Luggage . You know how much time you lose by checking in ?
NATALIE: I do n't know , maybe five minutes waiting for
RYAN: Thirty five minutes per flight . I travel two hundred seventy days a year . That makes one hundred fifty seven hours That 's Seven Days . You ready to throw away a whole week on that ?
NATALIE: You ca n't be serious .
RYAN: Never get behind people travelling with infants . I 've never seen a stroller collapse in less than twenty minutes .
NATALIE: That 's racist .
RYAN: I 'm like my mother . I stereotype . It 's faster .
NATALIE: No . Why ?
RYAN: Fats Domino had a lighter touch .
NATALIE: I type with purpose .
RYAN: What are you working on so furiously ?
NATALIE: I 'm building a work flow of firing techniques . Questions & responses . Actions & reactions . A script that works kind of like a tributary , taking you through the steps of firing someone .
RYAN: Who is it for ?
NATALIE: Theoretically , you could put it in the hands of anybody and they could e downsizing immediately . All they have to do is follow the steps .
RYAN: Natalie , what is it , you think we do here ?
NATALIE: We prepare the newly unemployed fo the emotional and physical hurdles of job hunting while Minimizing potential legal blowback ?
RYAN: That 's what we 're selling . But it 's not what we 're doing .
NATALIE: Okay , what are we doing ?
RYAN: Our job is to make limbo tolerable - To ferry wounded souls across the iver of dread and humiliation to the point at which hope 's bright shore is dimly visible
FRANKLY: And then to stop the boat , shove'em in the water , and make them swim while we row back to the palace of their banishment to present the employers with our bills .
NATALIE: That was really impressive . You ehearse that ?
RYAN: I got to grab this . I 'll meet you at the rental lot .
ALEX: I 'm in Hotlanta . I need a rib joint ecommend bad .
RYAN: Fat Matt 's . Bring a bib .
ALEX: You have n't called .

ALEX: Ryan , I 'm not some waitress you anged in a snow storm . The word `` Appropriate '' has no place in ou collective vocabulary . I 'm the woman you do n't have to worry about .
RYAN: This sounds like a trick .
ALEX: Next time you 're worried about manners - Do n't . If you want to call - Call . Just think of me as yourself only with a vagina .
RYAN: When am I going to see you ?
ALEX: I 'm out of Hartsfield , into IAD , then a connection at ORD into SDF .

BOB: Positive effect ?
NATALIE: Well , tests have shown that children under moderate trauma have a tendency to apply themselves academically as a method of coping .
BOB: Go fuck yourself . That 's what my kids 'll think .
RYAN: Your children 's admiration is important to you ?
BOB: Yeah . It was .
RYAN: Well , I doubt they ever admired you , Bob .
BOB: Hey asshole , are n't you here to console me ?
RYAN: I 'm not a shrink , Bob . I 'm a wake up call . You know why kids love athletes ?

I 'm not talking hotel rooms and rental cars either , ut internet services , cell phone , music downloads , teleflorists . The works . I shop them according to the miles they pay and I pit them against each other for the most value .
NATALIE: So , what are you saving up for ? Hawaii ? South of France ?
RYAN: No , it 's not like that The miles are the goal .
NATALIE: That 's it ? You 're saving to save ?

ALEX: I know . You 're so cool . `` Mr . Empty Back Pack '' .
RYAN: You know about the back pack ?
ALEX: I googled you .
RYAN: You did ?
ALEX: It 's what us modern girls do when we have a crush .
RYAN: Did it bother you ?
ALEX: Well , that depends . Is the bag empty because you hate people o just the baggage they bring along ?
RYAN: I do n't hate people . I 'm not exactly a hermit .
ALEX: You just do n't want to be tied down ? The whole responsibility thing .
RYAN: I do n't think it 's even that I First time I ever flew , I was sixteen .
ALEX: You 're not going to answer ? You 're just going to tell me a story ?
RYAN: It was January and I had just gotten my driver 's license . The lakes were frozen over , so we piled into my car and hit the ice to do donuts . When , out of nowhere , I hit a soft spot and the hood of my ca tilted up and I was sinking ackwards into the water .
ALEX: Jesus
RYAN: I literally started to drown . Within a few seconds , I black out . Then , I wake up in the sky . I 'm in a helicopter , laying on a stretcher . This guy in a uniform is telling me I was minutes away from dying .
ALEX: Oh my God .
RYAN: Right ? So just as we 're hovering over the hospital , I sit up . And from there , I could see the whole western horizon . We 'd been flying twenty minutes . Twenty minutes to reach a city I 'd thought of as remote , halfway across the state a foreign capital .
A BEAT: My parents had taught me we lived in the best place on Earth , but now I could see the world was really just one place and comparing did n't make much sense . And I remembe thinking - Do n't tell me this is n't an age of miracles . Do n't tell me we ca n't be everywhere at once .
RYAN: I do n't know what originally sparked the back pack . I probably needed to be alone . Recently , I 've een thinking that maybe I needed to empty the bag before I knew what to put back in .
SOFTWARE DUDE: Hey I think we 're out of gas .
RYAN: Hey , you 're up
ALEX: Got to fly stand-by and make a meeting in Milwaukee .

ALEX: Neither can I .

NATALIE: Really never thought about it ?
RYAN: No .
NATALIE: How can you not think about these things ? How does it not even cross your mind that you might want to have a future with somebody ?

NATALIE: Yes .
RYAN: Right . Well , I do n't .
NATALIE: You 're an asshole .
RYAN: Oh come on , I 'm just dicking around . I need your help
NATALIE: Do n't you think it 's worth giving her a chance ?
RYAN: A chance to what ?
NATALIE: A chance at something real ?
RYAN: Natalie , your definition of `` real '' is going to evolve as you get older
NATALIE: Would you stop condescending fo one second ? Or is that one of the principles of your bullshit philosophy ?
RYAN: Bullshit philosophy ?
NATALIE: The isolation ? The traveling ? Is that supposed to be charming ?
RYAN: No , it 's simply a life choice .
NATALIE: It 's a cocoon of self-banishment .
RYAN: Wow . Big words .
NATALIE: Screw you .
RYAN: Well , screw you too .
NATALIE: You 've set up a way of life that asically makes it impossible fo you to make any human connections . Now , somehow , this woman runs the gauntlet of your ridiculous `` life choice '' and comes out the other end with a smile - Just so you can call her casual . Jesus . I need to grow up ?

RYAN: Look . You know . I 'm not the wedding type . But for the first time in my life I do n't want to be that guy , alone with his drink . I want a dancing partner . I want a plus one . And if you can stomach it , I 'd like it to be you .
ALEX: Okay .
RYAN: Really ?
ALEX: Yeah , I ca n't believe I Yeah , I 'm in . When is it ?

KARA: Ryan ?
RYAN: Kara
KARA: Well , hello .
ALEX: Hi .
KARA: Ryan has told me nothing about you .
RYAN: Kara , what are you doing at a hotel ?
KARA: Fuck , I was hoping I would n't have to Yeah , uh , Frank and I are trying out a trial separation .
RYAN: You 're not staying at the house ?

RYAN: Oh , okay .
KARA: Yup . So , you guys are dating ?
RYAN: Um
ALEX: It 's not exactly
KARA: Hey , do n't worry about it . We 're all getting a little old to be calling someone girlfriend I emember when mom used to call Jack her boyfriend . It drove me up the wall . Boyfriends are for kids

RYAN: Me ? You 're the one getting married .

PROUDLY: Jim designed it .
RYAN: I brought those photos you were asking for
JULIE: Oh great ! They go over there .
RYAN: There were quite a few already up there . Almost could n't find room .
JULIE: I know , is n't it great how everyone chipped in ?
RYAN: What gave you the idea to do something so
ALEX: Substantial ?
JULIE: Well , Jim has a lot of our nest egg invested in this real estate venture right now . So when we went over our finances , a honeymoon just did n't seem affordable this second So I thought Hey , just ecause we ca n't travel does n't mean we ca n't have pictures .
ALEX: It was a great idea .
JULIE: Thanks .
JIM: It 's sixty acres up against the foothills . I subdivided the old Lazy W Ranch and took a nice slice for myself .
RYAN: Sounds nice .
JIM: Homes will go in the high fours .
RYAN: Must be a nice development .
JIM: It 's a community , not a development . The concept is turn-key everything . You buy a maintenance contract with the home . We 'll whack your weeds , we 'll even change the light bulb . Furniture ? You buy your own or choose a package . Seamless traditionalism , yet all the perks .
RYAN: Nice .
JIM: We all need a place to call ou own . This is America . This is what we were promised .

JULIE: No , I 'm good . I 'll have some warm milk . That should do the trick .
JIM: One more box
ALEX: I 'll get it .
RYAN: You sure ?
ALEX: Yeah , yeah
RYAN: Jim seems like a good guy .
JULIE: Yeah , I know Is n't he great ?
KARA: He 's going to make a great husband .
RYAN: Hey , Julie , I was thinking with dad not being Well , I did n't know if you had someone to walk you down the aisle
JULIE: Oh , yeah , Jim 's uncle is going to do it .
KARA: He 's been really supportive .
RYAN: Oh Oh , great . Just wanted to make sure you were covered . So I should get there at
JULIE: Guests are arriving around 5ish . Things get going at 530 . So you know , around then . It 's easy . Just come down the elevator .

KARA: No Ryan . Actually , she 's 37 years old . She 's barely squeaking by .
RYAN: Oh .
KARA: Yup . Sleep tight .
ALEX: That 's all you got ?
RYAN: Are we really doing this ?
ALEX: Give me a boost .
RYAN: I took geography in here .
ALEX: You ever fool around with one of your teachers ?
RYAN: No . You ?
ALEX: Not until college . Come on , show me around .
RYAN: Point guard . Do n't act so surprised .
ALEX: I did n't know you were such a jock .
RYAN: My first fight .
ALEX: How 'd it go ?
RYAN: Got my ass kicked .
ALEX: Very romantic .
RYAN: Go Cougars !
KARA: Ryan , where are you ? We 're having a meltdown here .
RYAN: What 's wrong ? What happened ?
KARA: It 's Jim . Can you get back here ? We need your help .
RYAN: Yeah , of course
ALEX: I 'll grab your suit .
ADDING: Good luck .
RYAN: What happened ?
KARA: Jim 's got cold feet .
RYAN: Today ?
KARA: That 's how cold feet work .
RYAN: What do you want me to do ?
KARA: Talk to him .
RYAN: You want me to talk to him ?
KARA: Hey , it 's either you or me . You know my ecord . I 've already struck out once .
RYAN: I have n't been to bat . I have n't een in the dugout .
KARA: Do n't you talk for a living ? Motivational type stuff ?
RYAN: I tell people how to avoid commitment .
KARA: What kind of fucked up message is that ?
RYAN: It 's a philosophy .
KARA: It 's stupid .
RYAN: Hey , it might have helped you .
KARA: Come on , Ryan . You have n't been around much . Fuck , you basically do n't exist to us . I know you want to be there for her Well here it is . This is your chance .
JIM: Ryan ?
RYAN: Oh , hey Jim .
JIM: You ever read this ?
RYAN: Yeah , it 's pretty powerful stuff .
JIM: I 'll say .
RYAN: Kara mentioned you were having some thoughts ?
JIM: I do n't think I can do this .
RYAN: Okay . What makes you say that today ?
JIM: I was just laying there last night in bed and I could n't sleep . I was thinking about the wedding and the ceremony and all . Us buying a house and moving in together . Having a kid Having another kid Thanksgiving , Christmas , spring eak , football games , all of a sudden they 're out of school , getting jobs , getting married , And then , you know I 'm a grandparent . I 'm retired . Before you know it - I 'm dead and I just kept thinking `` What 's the point ? ''
RYAN: The point ?
JIM: Yeah , I mean , what am I starting here ?
RYAN: It 's marriage it 's the most eautiful thing on Earth you know , what everyone aspires to
JIM: You never got married .
RYAN: That 's true
JIM: You never even tried .
RYAN: Well , it 's hard to define `` try '' .
JIM: You seem happier than most of my married friends .
RYAN: Jim , I 'm not going to lie . Marriage can be a pain in the ass . And you 're kind of right - All of this is just stuff on the way to you eventual demise .
A BEAT: There is n't a `` point '' .
JIM: No I guess not .
RYAN: I do n't want to sound like a Hallmark card , but Life ? It 's etter with company .
JIM: Yeah , Julie went back to the apartment and I was all alone in that big honeymoon suite
RYAN: Kind of lonely ?
JIM: Yeah .
RYAN: Hey . Everybody needs a copilot .
JIM: That 's a nice touch .
RYAN: Thanks .
JIM: What 's the mood like out there ?
RYAN: It 's not good Emotional .
JIM: What should I do ?
RYAN: Go get her .
JIM: I 'm sorry I 'm such a fuck up Will you be my co-pilot ?
KARA: Welcome home .
RYAN: Hi , I 'm Ryan .
WEDDING GUEST: I 'm your cousin Harold .

ALEX: So settled down . You 're not going to change on me
RYAN: Same guy . Just one address .
ALEX: Call me if you get lonely .
RYAN: I 'm lonely .
NATALIE: Some guy sits down in a conference room somewhere and a server routes their session to one of our termination engineers .
RYAN: You do n't actually call them that .
NATALIE: I prefer `` terminators '' , but it umped with legal .
RYAN: Really ? I ca n't imagine why .
NATALIE: They follow a workflow that can take them through anything from a standard dismissal to a violent aggressor .
RYAN: Are they actually on line , right now ?
NATALIE: No , they 're beta-testing . Role-playing . We go live at the end of the month . Kyle , you 're running through the events too quickly . You have to give them time to acknowledge each statement . Okay ? It 's a legal thing .
RYAN: This is ridiculous .

EDIE: I 'm sorry . Dean Keaton Renault 's hand is already out .
RENAULT: Monsieur Renault . A pleasure .
KEATON: How do you do ?
FORTIER: Monsieur Fortier . So nice to finally meet you .
KEATON: Skeptical .
RENAULT: We find the concept brilliant , but New York is difficult for new restaurants . How can we be certain that our money will e returned in the long run ? Keaton looks at Edie and smiles confidently .
KEATON: It 's simple gentlemen , design versatility . A restaurant that can change with taste without losing the overall aesthetic . Our atmosphere wo n't be painted on the walls .
FORTIER: This was the part of the proposal that intrigued us , but I 'm not sure I follow .
KEATON: Let 's say for example -
KUJAN: Time for another one .
KEATON: This is my attorney , Edie Finneran .
KUJAN: Special Agent Kujan . U.S. Customs . These gentlemen are with the New York police department . You look great , Keaton . Better than I would have thought .
RENAULT: Is there a problem , Mr. Keaton ?
KUJAN: The small matter of a stolen truck-load of guns that wound up on a boat to Ireland last night .
FORTIER: Mr. Keaton ?
KEATON: If you will excuse us for a moment , gentlemen .
KUJAN: We need to ask you some questions downtown . You 'll be quite awhile . Renault starts to get up .
RENAULT: We should leave you to discuss whateve this is .
KEATON: Please . Sit .
HOCKNEY: Hand-me-the-keys , you-fucking-cock- sucker .
MCMANUS: This has to be embarrassing for you guys , huh ? I mean you know and I know this is a load of shit , but at least I do n't have a captain with his dick in my ass making me play along . That has got to suck ,
FENSTER: I want to call my lawyer . I don ; 't know about any truck . I was in Connecticut all night on Friday .
HOCKNEY: - my lawyer . I 'll have your badge , cocksucker .
KEATON: with what ?
FENSTER: Somebody should do something . What is this shit - getting hauled in every five minutes ? Okay , so I did a little time , does that mean I get railed every time a truck finds its way off the planet ?
HOCKNEY: These guys got no probable cause .
FENSTER: You 're fuckin ' A right , no P.C . Well screw P.C . No right . No goddamn right . You do some time , they never let you go . Treat me like a criminal , I 'll end up a criminal .
HOCKNEY: You are a criminal .
FENSTER: Why you got ta go and do that ? I 'm trying to make a point .
KEATON: Then make it . Christ , you 're making me tired all over . McManus looks at Keaton . McMANUS I heard you were dead , Keaton .
HOCKNEY: The word I got is you hung up your spurs , man . What 's that all about ? McMANUS What 's this ?
FENSTER: I 'd say you 've gotten on his main and central nerve , McManus .
KEATON: Do your friend a favor , Fenster , keep him quiet . McMANUS You 're clean , Keaton ? Say it ai n't so . Was it you that hit that truck ?
FENSTER: Forget him . It 's not important . I was trying to make a point .
KEATON: This whole thing was a shakedown . McMANUS What makes you say that ?
FENSTER: So why the hell was I hauled in and cavity searched tonight ?
KEATON: It was the Feds . A truck load of guns gets snagged , Customs comes down on N.Y.P.D . for some answers - they come up with us . They 're grabbing at straws . It 's politics - nothing you can do .
FENSTER: I had a guy 's fingers in my asshole tonight .
HOCKNEY: Is it Friday already ?
FENSTER: Fuck you . I'11 never shit right again . So who did it ? Own up .
KEATON: I do n't want to know . McMANUS Nobody asked you , workin'-man .
HOCKNEY: Fuck who did it . What I want to know is , who 's the gimp ?
KEATON: He 's alright .
HOCKNEY: How do I know that ? How about it , pretzel-man ? What 's your story ?
KEATON: His name is Verbal Kint . I thought you guys knew him . McMANUS Verbal ?
VERBAL: Roger really . People say I talk too much .
HOCKNEY: Yeah , I was gon na tell you to shut up .
KEATON: We 've met once or twice . Last time was in
VERBAL: County . I was in for fraud .
KEATON: You were waiting for a line-up then , too . What happened with that ?
VERBAL: I walked . Ninety days , suspended .
HOCKNEY: So you did it ?
VERBAL: To your mother 's ass .
KEATON: Let it go . Verbal smiles at Keaton appreciatively .
HOCKNEY: What do you care what he says ? McMANUS Yeah , I 'm just talking here , and Hockney seems to want to hear me out . I know Fenster is with me - How about you , guy ? McManus finishes pissing .
VERBAL: I 'm interested , sure . McMANUS There , so you see , I 'm going to exercise my right to free assembly .
KEATON: I 'm not kidding . Shut your mouth .
COP: Who are you ?
BAER: Agent Jack Baer , F.B.I . How many dead ?
COP: Fifteen so far . We 're still pulling some odies out of the water .
BAER: f do n't want any of the bodies taken away until I 've had a chance to go over this , understood ?
COP: I have to clear the scene . I 've got word direct from the Chief Baer lights a cigarette , only half listening .
BAER: Yes , the chief . Spooky stuff . Any survivors ?
COP: Two . There 's a guy in county hospital , ut he 's in a coma . The D.A . has the other guy - A cripple - from New York I think . Listen , the Chief said -
BAER: Excuse me .
VOICE #1: No provisions , nothing . My clients testimony for his immunity .
VOICE #2: May-I be frank , Counselor ? I suspect you political power as much as I respect it . I do n't know why Mr. Kint has so many faceless allies in City Hall , and I do n't care . The embarrassment he helped cause the city of New York will not happen here .
VOICE #1: Immunity .
VOICE #2: Counselor , I will prosecute your client .
VOICE #1: Then prosecute . I will be very impressed to see if the District Attorney manages to bring in twenty-seven simultaneous counts of murder against one man with cerebral palsy . I would think a man with your job would agree with these alleged & quot ; faceless people in City Hall & quot ; you mention .
VOICE #2: I'11 take my chances then . I'11 feel safer without a job if a man like Mr. Kint is behind bars .
VOICE #1: Mr. Kint will plead guilty to weapons possession .
VOICE #2: You 're joking .
VOICE #1: Weapons . Misdemeanor one .
VOICE #2: Counselor , you 're insulting me .
VOICE #1: Counselor , you 're bluffing . Shall I push for misdemeanor two ?
KUJAN: What do you mean I ca n't see him ?
RAB IN: The D.A . came down here last night ready to arraign before they even moved him to county . Kint 's lawyer comes in and five minutes later , the D.A . comes out looking like he 'd been bitch-slapped by the oogey man . They took his statement and cut him a deal .
KUJAN: Did they charge him with anything ?
RAB IN: Weapons . Misdemeanor two .
KUJAN: What'the fuck is that ?
RABIN: I give the D.A . credit for getting that much to stick . This whole thing has turned political . The Mayor was here - the chief - the Governor called this morning , for Christ 's sake . This guy is
KUJAN: When does he post bail ?
RAB IN: Two hours , tops .
KUJAN: I want to see him .
RAB IN: He wo n't go into the interrogation room .
KUJAN: Someplace else , then .
RAB IN: Where ? Kujan looks around Rabin 's messy office .
KUJAN: If it was a dope deal , where 's the dope , if it was a hit , who called it in ?
KUJAN: You know damn well what I think .
RABIN: That 's crazy , Dave and it does n't matter . He has total immunity and his story checks out . He does n't know what you want to know .
KUJAN: I do n't think he does . Not exactly , but there 's a lot more to his story . I want to know why twenty-seven men died on that pier for what looks to be ninety-one million dollars worth of dope that was n't there . Above all , I want to be sure that Dean Keaton is dead .
RAB ZN: He 's dead .
KUJAN: Two hours . Just until he makes bail .
PLUMBER: Ridgly , this is Special Agent Jack Bae from the F.B.I . Agent Baer , this is Doctor Ridgly Waiters .
RIDGLY: Nice to meet you .
BAER: Is he talking ?
RIDGLY: He regained consciousness less than an hour ago . He spoke - not English - then he lapsed .
BAER: Hungarian ?
RIDGLY: I do n't
BAER: It was Hungarian . Most of them were Hungarians . Any fluent Hungarians on you staff ?
RIDGLY: We have a Turkish audiologist . Ridgly opens a door and Baer barrels through .
BAER: will he die ?
PLUMBER: There 's a chance .
KOVASH: & lt ; & lt ; Find someone who understands me , you idiot , I 'm going to be killed , You 'll all be killed if he has to do it . Help me , God . They 're all stupid . Get someone who understands me o we 're all going to die. & gt ; & gt ;
BAER: Call hospital security and put a man on the door until the police get here .
KOVASH: & lt ; & lt ; Why are you just standing there , you idiot ? I 'm not speaking English am I ? Would n't it make sense to find someone who could talk to me so you could find the person that set me on fire , perhaps ? He is the Devil . You 've never seen anyone like Keyse Soze in all your miserable life you idiot . Keyser Soze . Do you at least understand that ? Keyser Soze . The Devil himself . Or are you American policemen io stupid that you have n't even heard of him . Keyser Soze , you idiculous man . KEYSER SOZE . & gt ; & gt ;
PLUMBER: Is he dangerous ?
BAER: Yes .
KOVASH: Keyser - Soze .
BAER: What ?
KOVASH: Keyser - Soze .
BAER: No shit ? Joel , call Dan Metzheiser over at Justice and find Dave Kujan from Customs .
KUJAN: Verbal , you know we 're trying to help you .
VERBAL: Sure . And I appreciate that . And I want to help you , Agent Kujan . I like cops . I would have liked to have been a Fed myself but my C.P . was -
KUJAN: Verbal , I know you know something . I know you 're not telling us everything .
VERBAL: I told the D.A . everything I know .
KUJAN: Keaton was a piece of shit .
VERBAL: You trying to get a rise out of me , Agent Kujan ?
KUJAN: I just want to hear your story .
VERBAL: It 's right here .
KUJAN: According to your statement you are a short-con operator . Run of the mill seams . Everything you do , you learned from somebody else .
VERBAL: That 's been suppressed . Anything in there is inadmissible .
KUJAN: Oh , I know . Sweet deal you have . Total immunity .
VERBAL: Well I do have the weapons charge . I 'm looking at six whole months hard time .
KUJAN: You know a dealer named Ruby Deemer , Verbal ?
VERBAL: You know a religious guy named John Paul ?
KUJAN: You know Ruby is in Attica ?
VERBAL: He did n't have my lawyer .
KUJAN: I know Ruby . He 's very big on respect . Likes me very much .
VERBAL: There 's nothing in there about Ruby .
KUJAN: I'11 be sure to mention that to him .
VERBAL: No .
KUJAN: I'11 get right to the point . I 'm smarte than you . I'11 find out what I want to know and I'11 get it from you whether you like it or not .
VERBAL: I 'm not a rat .
RAB IN: Can we get started again ?
KUJAN: Now what happened after the line-up ?
EDIE: and the desk Sergeant is actually trying to tell me he ca n't release you ? Can you believe that ? You were n't even charged . New York police - Jesus . I want to take pictures of your face to bring to the D.A . first thing in the morning .
KEATON: Just forget about it .
EDIE: Absolutely not .
KEATON: Edie , please . I do n't want to hear this ight now . What did Renault and Fortie say ?
EDIE: They want more time to think about investing .
KEATON: Goddamnit .
EDIE: They just said they wanted time .
KEATON: Time for what , Edie ? Time to look into me a little more , that 's what . No matter how well you cover my tracks now , they 'll find out who I am .
EDIE: Give me some credit . I got you this far , let 's go to the grand jury . This is neve going to stop if we -
KEATON: No . It 's never going to stop , period . It wo n't take more than a week before every investor in this city is walking away from us . It 's finished . I 'm finished .
EDIE: Do n't give up on me now , Dean .
KEATON: They 'll never stop .
EDIE: I love you .
KEATON: They ruined me tonight .
EDIE: Dean , I love you . Do you hear me ?
KEATON: Huh ?
EDIE: Come home with me , please . Dean ?
KEATON: Alright .
VERBAL: I just asked one of the detectives downtown . He seemed pretty happy to tell me .
EDIE: Dean , who was at the
VERBAL: How do you do ?
KEATON: Verb - Roger , this is Edie Finneran . Edie , this is Roger Kint , he was at
EDIE: I know who he is .
VERBAL: I hope I did n't disturb you .
EDIE: I hope so , too , Mr. Kint . Can I get you something to drink ?
VERBAL: A glass of water would be nice .
KEATON: What the hell do you want ?
VERBAL: I wanted to talk to you . The other guys -
KEATON: I did you a favor by standing up for you last night , but do n't think we 're friends . I 'm sorry , but I have othe things -
VERBAL: They 're gon na do a job . Three million dollars , maybe more .
EDIE: So what is it you do , Mr. Kint ?
VERBAL: Umm
EDIE: A hijacker like Dean , here ? Or something more creative ?
KEATON: That 's enough , Edie .
EDIE: I do n't know what you came here for , but we wo n't have any part of it .
KEATON: Edie , please .
EDIE: I 've spent the last year of my life putting his back together again - I wo n't have you come in here and - What makes you think - GET OUT . GET OUT OF m HOME .
KEATON: Get out .
VERBAL: If you 'll just let me -
KEATON: Hurt you , you sonofabitch ? I could kill you . Keaton starts to shove Verbal out the door .
VERBAL: They 're going to hit the Taxi Service . Keaton freezes . LONG PAUSE .
KEATON: They - That 's bullshit . They do n't operate anymore .
VERBAL: McManus has a friend in the Fourteenth Precinct . They 're coming out for one jo - Thursday . They 're picking up a guy smuggling emeralds out of South America . Fenster and McManus have a fence set to take the stuff .
KEATON: What fence ? Who ?
VERBAL: Some guy in California . His name is Redfoot .
KEATON: Never heard of him .
VERBAL: You have to come .
KEATON: What 's with you ? What do you care whethe I come or not ?
VERBAL: They - They do n't know me . You do . They wo n't take me unless you go . Look at me . I need this .
KEATON: Tough break .
VERBAL: Do n't tell me you do n't need this . Is this your place ? Keaton is unable to answer .
KEATON: You watch your mouth .
VERBAL: Okay , okay . You say it 's the real thing ? That 's cool .
KEATON: I apologize .
VERBAL: I was out of line .
KEATON: You okay ?
VERBAL: I'11 be alright .
KEATON: Well , I 'm sorry .
VERBAL: Forget it . I'11 probably shit blood tonight .
KEATON: How are they going to do it ?
VERBAL: McManus wants to go in shooting . I said no way .
KEATON: Fenster and Hockney ?
VERBAL: They 're pretty pissed off . They 'll do anything . Now I got a way to do it without killing anyone ut like I said , they wo n't let me in without you .
KEATON: Three million ?
VERBAL: Maybe more .
KEATON: No killing ?
VERBAL: Not if we do it my way .
KEATON: I swore I 'd live above myself . Verbal smiles , knowing he has him .
RIZZI: How was the flight ? Oscar hands Rizzi a thick envelope .
OSCAR: Will that get me to the Pierre ?
RIZZI: That 'll get you to Cape God .
STRAUSZ: What the
RIZZI: LOOK OUT .
STRAUSZ: Give it up .
HOCKNEY: We db now , Jerk-off .
VERBAL: In California ? McMANUS Yeah . It 'll take a few days . Me and Fenste
HOCKNEY: Hold the fuckin ' phone . You and Fenster ? No , no , no . McMANUS Guys , come on .
FENSTER: Then who goes ?
HOCKNEY: We all go . How about it , Keaton ?
KEATON: We need to lay low for a while .
VERBAL: We 're going to miss the flight .
KEATON: We 'll make it .
VERBAL: Do n't do this . Send her a card - something .
KEATON: We 'll make it .
VERBAL: We 're gon na miss the plane . She 'll understand .
KUJAN: Heartwarming . Really , I feel weepy .
VERBAL: You wanted to know what happened afte the line-up , I 'm telling you .
KUJAN: Oh come on , Verbal . Who do you think you 're talking to ? You really expect me to believe he retired ? For a woman ? Bullshit . He was using her .
VERBAL: He loved her .
KUJAN: Sure . And I 'm supposed to believe that hitting the Taxi Service was n't his idea either .
VERBAL: That was all Fenster and McManus .
KUJAN: Come on . Keaton was a cop for four years . Who else would know the Taxi Service
KUJAN: Let me tell you something . I know Dean Keaton . I 've been investigating him fo
VERBAL: You got him wrong .
VERBAL: I do n't know about that .
KUJAN: I do n't think you do . But you say you saw Keaton die . I think you 're covering his ass and he 's still out there somewhere . I think he was behind that whole circus in the harbor . My bet is he 's using you ecause you 're stupid and you think he 's your friend . You tell me he 's dead , so be it . I want to make sure he 's dead before I go back to New York .
VERBAL: He was n't behind anything . It was the lawyer .
KUJAN: What lawyer ?
VERBAL: Back when I was in that barber shop quartet in Skokie , Illinois I used to have
KUJAN: You think I do n't know you held out on the D.A. ? What did you leave out of that testimony ? I can be on the phone to Ruby Deemer in ten minutes .
VERBAL: The D.A . gave me immunity .
VERBAL: There was a lawyer . Kobayashi .
KUJAN: Is he the one that killed Keaton ?
VERBAL: No . But I 'm sure Keaton 's dead .
KUJAN: Convince me . Tell me every last detail .
BAER: Are you the translator ?
BODI: Patrolman Lionel Bodi , sir .
PLUMBER: Agent Beer , this is getting out of hand .
BAER: I'11 see to it we 're gone before he blows his porch light , Doctor . Baer gestures to Tracy .
BODI: Hi .
TRACY: Hi .
METZHEISER: I 've got a noon meeting , Baer .
PLUMBER: Agent Baer , please .
BAER: Everyone calm down . Ask this man about the shoot-out in the harbor .
BODI: & lt ; & lt ; My name is Bodi . How are you ' & gt ; & gt ;
KOVASH: & lt ; & lt ; How am 17 You are as stupid as that one , but at least I can talk to you. & gt ; & gt ;
BODI: & lt ; & lt ; You 'll be alright . He is from the F.B.I . He is here to help you . He wants to know what happened in the harbor. & gt ; & gt ;
BODI: He says they were buying It does n't make sense . I 'm sorry , I 'm a little usty . They were there to buy something .
BAER: Dope , we know .
KOVASH +: & lt ; & lt ; You do n't understand me either ? God
BODI: Not dope . Something else . Some what ? .. He does n't knob what they were buying . But not dope people .
METZHEISER: Your witness is whacked , Baer .
BODI: He says he 'll tell us everything he knows if we protect him .
.BAER: Tell him fine .
BODI: & lt ; & lt ; He says that is fine. & gt ; & gt ;
BODI: No good . He needs guarantees . He says his life is in danger He has seen the Devil looked him in the eye .
METZHEISER: I'11 be on my way . Baer grabs Metzheiser by the arm .
BAER: Tell him to tell this man what he was telling me before . Who is the Devil ? Who did he see ?
BODI: & lt ; & lt ; Who is this Devil you keep talking about ? & gt ; & gt ;
KOVASH: Keyser Soze He was in the harbo shooting everyone in sight. & gt ; & gt ; Metzheiser is suddenly interested .
BODI: He says he saw him in the harbor . He was shooting Killing Killing many men .
METZHEISER: Did he say Keyser Soze ? He saw Keyse Soze
BODI: He says he saw him in the harbor . He was shooting Killing Killing many men .
METZHEISER: Did he say Keyser Soze ? He saw Keyse Soze .
BODI: He says he knows his face . He sees it when he closes his eyes .
METZHEISER: Ask him what this Devil looks like .
BAER: Ready ? Tracy holds up her pad and pencil . She nods .
REDFOOT: How 've you been ? McMANUS Good . You ?
FENSTER: Getting by .
REDFOOT: You got it ? McManus holds up a briefcase .
KEATON: Snazzy dresser this guy .
REDFOOT: You must be Keaton . McMANUS Jesus , I 'm sorry . Redfoot , this is Dean Keaton , that 's Todd Hockney , and that 's Verbal Kint .
KEATON: We 're on vacation .
REDFOOT: I 've got a ton of work and no good people . McMANUS What 's the job ?
HOCKNEY: Security ?
REDFOOT: Two bodyguards . Pretty good . McMANUS Give us time to check it out ?
KEATON: A friend of mine in New York tells me you knew Spook Hollis .
REDFOOT: I hear you did time with old Spook . Yeah , he was a good egg . I used to run a lot of dope for him . Fuckin ' shame he got shivved .
KEATON: I shivved him .
REDFOOT: Business or personal ?
KEATON: A little of both .
REDFOOT: Ai n't it a crime ? Call if you 're interested .
KEATON: One job , that was the deal . McMANUS Take it as it comes , brother .
VERBAL: What is it Keaton ?
KEATON: Something - I do n't know . I ever tell you about the restaurant I wanted to open ?
HIGHAM: Just get in the car Saul .
HOCKNEY: I get out of the car , and man if the thing was n't wrecked . And I see this oad in the back seat with nothing on .
FENSTER: RIGHT THERE . FREEZE .
KEATON: Give me the case .
HOCKNEY: What the hell ? McManus Bad day . Fuck it .
KEATON: Move .
MCMANUS: You gon na kill him ?
KEATON: I 'm going to deal with him .
REDFOOT: Get a grip . I did n't know .
KEATON: You did n't know .
REDFOOT: The job got thrown to me by this lawyer .
KEATON: Who is he ?
REDFOOT: Some Limey . He 's a middle-man fo somebody . He does n't say and I do n't ask .
KEATON: We want to meet him .
REDFOOT: He wants to meet you . He called last night and asked me to set it up . What do I tell him '
KEATON: Tell him we 'll meet . McMANUS If you 're lying , Redfoot
REDFOOT: McManus , you 're a real bad-ass , but get off my tip . McManus lunges for Redfoot .
KUJAN: So this lawyer
VERBAL: Kobayashi .
KUJAN: Came from Redfoot .
VERBAL: Right .
KUJAN: And why leave this out when you talked to the D.A . ?
RAB IN: Someone to see you , Agent Kujan .
KUJAN: Jack . What are you doing here ?
BAER: I 've been looking all over for you . You still after the coke that walked out of that blood bath in the harbor ?
KUJAN: Yeah .
BAER: You can stop looking . There was no coke . I 've been in L.A. county with a guy they
KUJAN: There was ninety-one million -
BAER: We know , but our man says no way on the dope . This Hungarian tells me the whole unch was pulling stumps for Turkey the next ' day . They had no time to negotiate that kind of product and no means to move it .
KUJAN: What was the money for ?
BAER: He did n't know . No one doing the deal knew except a few key people . This guy says they were real hush about it . Whatever it was it was highly sensitive .
KUJAN: I do n't get it .
BAER: They tell me you got the cripple from New York in there . He mention Keyser Soze
KUJAN: Who ?
BAER: Bear with me here
KUJAN: Who is Keyser Soze
VERBAL: Ahhh fuck .
KEATON: So I need to know if anyone can think of anybody . Somebody with power . Enough to possibly track us from New York . McMANUS Look . We 've been over it for an hour now . I say we pack up and run . Let 's go back to New York . At least get out of L.A .
KOBAYASHI: Mr. Keaton ?
KEATON: What can we do for you ?
KOBAYASHI: My employer requires your services . One job . One day 's work . Very dangerous . I do n't expect all of you to live , but those who do will have ninety-one million dollars to divide any way they see fit .
KEATON: Who 's your boss ?
KOBAYASHI: My employer wishes to remain anonymous .
KEATON: Do n't jerk me off . We all know what this is . You do n't work with me if I work with you without knowing who I 'm working for . Now let 's cut the shit . Who 's the man ?
KOBAYASHI: I work for Keyser Sate .
KEATON: What is this ?
VERBAL: Who 's Keyser Soze ?
KOBAYASHI: I am sure you 've heard a number of tall tales , myths and legends about Mr. Soze I can assure you gentlemen , most of them are true .
VERBAL: Who 's Keyser Soze ?
KOBAYASHI: Judging by the sudden change in mood , I am sure the rest of your associates can tell you , Mr. Kint . I have come with an offer directly from Mr. Soze . An orde actually .
KEATON: An order .
KOBAYASHI: In nineteen-eighty one , Mr. Keaton , you participated in the hijacking of a truck in Buffalo , New York . The cargo was raw steel . Steel that belonged to Mr. Soze and was destined for Pakistan to be used in a Nuclear reactor . A very profitable violation of U.N . Regulations . You had no way of knowing this , because the man shipping the steel was working for Mr .
KEATON: You set up the line-up .
KOBAYASHI: Mr. Soze made a few calls , yes . You were not to be released until I came to see you . It seems Mr. Keaton 's attorney , Ms. Finneran , was a bit too effective in expediting his release . Holding the rest of you became a moot point .
KEATON: What about Redfoot ?
FENSTER: So why tell us ?
KOBAYASHI: Because you have stolen from Mr. Soze . That you did not know you stole from him is the only reason you are still alive , ut he feels you owe him . You will repay your debt .
HOCKNEY: Who is this guy ? How do we know you work for Soze
KOBAYASHI: I do n't think that is relevant , Mr. Hockney . The five of you are responsible for the murder of Saul Berg and his odyguards . Mr. Redfoot can attest to your involvement , and we can see to it that he will . He is not of you & quot ; superior & quot ; breed .
MCMANUS: This is a load of shit .
KOBAYASHI: The offer is this , gentlemen . Mr. Soze 's primary interest , as I am sure you all know , is narcotics . He 's been - competing shall we say , with a group of
KEATON: Give me one good reason why I should n't kill you right now .
KOBAYASHI: A gift from Mr. Soze gentlemen . He turns and walks out of the room .
KEATON: Jesus Christ . Open them .
HOCKNEY: They know everything . McMANUS This is my life in here . Everything I 've done since I was eighteen .
FENSTER: Everybody I ever worked with , did time with .
HOCKNEY: They fucking know everything .
KEATON: This is not right .
FENSTER: I do n't know . Who was that guy that used to talk about Soze in New York ? McMANUS Bricks Marlin .
KEATON: Come on . The guy is a pipe dream . This Kobayashi is using him for window dressing .
FENSTER: I do n't know . This is bad .
HOCKNEY: It 's bullshit . This guy could be L.A.P.D . I think it 's a setup .
FENSTER: The way I hear it , Soze is some kind of utcher . No pity .
KEATON: There ' is no Keyser Soze
VERBAL: Who is Keyser Soze
KUJAN: Do you believe in him , Verbal ?
VERBAL: Keaton always said & quot ; I do n't believe in God , but I 'm afraid of him. & quot ; Well I elieve in God , and the only thing that scares me is Keyser SOZE .
RAB IN: You give this any weight , Agent Baer ?
BAER: I can introduce you to Dan Metzheise from Justice . He has a file on Sate in D.C . It 's been a hobby of his for a few years . A lot of guys equate him to that eporter on the Incredible Hulk .
RABIN: Had you heard of him before ?
BAER: On the street ? A few times . Outside stuff . Somebody was working for a guy who was working for a guy who got money through Keyser Soze . That kind of shit . Could be an old badge . A hex sign to keep people from fucking with you back when a name meant something .
RAB IN: But you 're here .
BAER: Shit yeah . I got a guy trying to walk out of the hospital on d fried drumstick to get away from SOZE . I'11 run it up the flagpole .
VERBAL: I came clean . I told it like it happened on the boat . So what if I left out how I got there ? It 's got so many holes in it , the D.A . would 've told me to blow amnesty out my ass . So you got what you wanted out of me . Big fucking deal .
KUJAN: And this is why you never told the D.A .
VERBAL: You tell me , Agent Kujan . If I told you the Loch Ness Monster hired me to hit the harbor , what would you say ?
KUJAN: Turn state 's evidence . Take the stand on this and we 'll hear it out .
VERBAL: I 've got immunity now . What can you possibly offer me ?
KUJAN: If there is a Keyser Soze he 'll be looking for you .
VERBAL: Where 's your head , Agent Kujan ? Where do you think the pressure 's coming from ? Keyser Soze - or whatever you want to call him - knows where I am right now . He 's got the front burner under ' your ass to let me go so he can scoop me up ten minutes later . Immunity was just to deal with you assholes . I got a whole new problem when I post bail .
KUJAN: So why play into his hands ? We can protect you .
VERBAL: Gee , thanks , Dave . Bang-up job so far . Extortion , coercion . You 'll pardon me if I ask you to kiss my pucker . The same fuckers that rounded us up and sank us into this mess are telling me They 'll ail me out ? Fuck you . You think you can catch Keyser Soze ? You think a guy like that comes this close to getting fingered and sticks his head out ? If he comes up for anything , it will be to get rid of me . After that , my guess is you 'll never hea from him again .
KOVASH: & lt ; & lt ; It is longer than that . And not so dark . & gt ; & gt ;
BODI: & lt ; & lt ; Are you sure ? & gt ; & gt ;
KOVASH: & lt ; & lt ; Do n't be stupid. & gt ; & gt ;
BODI: He says the hair is longer and lighter .
VERBAL: That was how I ended up in a barber shop quartet in Skokie , Illinois .
KUJAN: This is totally irrelevant .
VERBAL: Oh , but it 's not . If I had n't been nailed in Illinois for running a three card monte in between sets , I never would have took off for New York . I neve would have met Keaton , see . That barbe shop quartet was the reason fo everything .
KUJAN: Can we just get back to Kobayashi ?
VERBAL: The quartet is part of the bit about Kobayashi . The quartet was in my file , along with every other thing I had done since high school , see ? Aliases , middle- men . They knew me better than I did . They knew all of us . Kujan looks at his watch .
KUJAN: You 're stalling , Verbal .
VERBAL: Give a guy a break , huh ?
KUJAN: What happened ?
VERBAL: We woke up the next morning and Fenste was gone . He could n't handle the idea of slumming for SOZE . He left a note wishing us good luck and took a chunk of the money we 'd scraped together .
KUJAN: Then what ?
VERBAL: McManus was furious . He was talking about tracking him down and ripping his heart out and all sorts of shit . That night we got the call .
KUJAN: What call ?
VERBAL: Kobayashi told us where we could find Fenster .
KEATON: What do you want to do with him ?
HOCKNEY: This is nuts . McMANUS Dig .
KEATON: Dig .
VERBAL: What are we gon na do ?
HOCKNEY: I can run . I got no problem with that .
KEATON: They do n't seem to have a problem with it either . McMANUS Nobody runs .
HOCKNEY: This ai n't my boy we 're burying . I do n't owe anybody .
KUJAN: And after they killed Fenster nobody would run ?
VERBAL: I wanted to . I thought we could make it .
KUJAN: Why did n't you say anything ?
VERBAL: I tried , believe me , but Keaton would n't have it . It was too far-fetched for him . Keaton was a grounded guy . An ex-cop . To a cop , the explanation is never that complicated . It 's always simple . There 's
HOCKNEY: He 's coming up .
KEATON: The answer is no .
KOBAYASHI: Mr. Soze will be most -
KEATON: Listen to me , cocksucker . There is no Keyser Sate . If you say his name again , I'11 kill you right here .
KOBAYASHI: A strange threat . I can only assume you 're here to kill me anyway . Pity about Mr. Redfoot . McMANUS Fair trade for Fenster . The elevator opens and Hockney steps out .
KEATON: We know you can get to us , and now you know we can get to you . I 'm offering you the chance to call this off .
KOBAYASHI: Mr. So- My employer has made up his mind . He does not change it .
KEATON: Neither do we . McMANUS You got Fenster , you may get more , but you wo n't get us all . Not before one of us gets to you .
KOBAYASHI: I believe you , Mr. McManus . I quite sincerely do . You would not have been chosen if you were not so capable , but I can not make this decision . Whatever you can threaten me with is ludicrous in comparison to what will be done to me if
KEATON: We 'll see .
KOBAYASHI: Before you do me in , you will let me finish my business with Ms. Finneran first , wo n't you ?
KEATON: What did you say ?
KOBAYASHI: Edie Finneran . She is upstairs in my office for an extradition deposition . I equested she be put on the case personally . She flew out yesterday . Everyone looks at Keaton .
KEATON: You 're lying .
KOBAYASHI: Am I ?
KEATON: It 's a logistical nightmare . Close quarters , no advance layout , ten men , maybe twenty .
HOCKNEY: Can we stealth these guys ?
KEATON: Doubtful . With all that coke , they 'll be eady - which brings me to sunny spot number two . Even if one of us gets through and jacks the boat , we get nothing . McMANUS And if we wait for the money ?
HOCKNEY: Me too .
VERBAL: Did you hear what he just said ?
HOCKNEY: If I 'm going in , I want a stake .
VERBAL: I just ca n't believe we 're just gon na walk into certain death .
VERBAL: What-are they speaking ?
KEATON: Russian , I think . I do n't know .
VERBAL: Hungarian ?
KEATON: Knock it off .
HOCKNEY: Are we ready , kids ?
KEATON: Everyone shut up . I 'm ready . McManus , you etter be set up in ten seconds . McMANUS I 'm there .
VERBAL: Keaton , I ca n't just -
KEATON: I want you to find Edie . Both of you find some place safe . Tell her what happened - Everything . She knows people . She 'll know what to do . If we ca n't get Kobayashi my way , she 'll get him her way .
VERBAL: What if I
KEATON: Just do what I tell you .
IT EXPLODES: The men surrounding Keaton , are distracted .
KUJAN: Why did n't you run ?
VERBAL: I froze up . I thought about Fenster and how he looked when we buried him , then I thought about Keaton . It looked like he might pull it off .
BAER: A boy came across a body on the beach this morning . Thrown clear when the boat urned . Shot once in the head . Two guys
KUJAN: And ?
RABIN: His name was Arturo Marquez . A petty smuggler out of Argentina . He was arrested in New York last year fo trafficking . He escaped to California and got picked up in Long Beach . They were setting up his extradition when he escaped again . Get this - Edie Finneran was called in to advise the proceedings .
KUJAN: Kobayashi . Bear nods .
RAB IN: I called New York County and they fared me a copy of Marquez 's testimony . He was a rat .
KUJAN: A big fucking rat .
RABIN +: Arturo was strongly opposed 'to going back to prison . So much so that he informed on close to fifty guys . Guess who he names for a finale ?
KUJAN: Keyser Soze
BAER: There 's more .
KUJAN: I'11 tell you what I know . Stop me when it sounds familiar . Verbal is confused .
KEATON: What happened to you ? McMANUS Keyser Soze is on the boat .
KUJAN: And that 's when you say in your statement that you saw
VERBAL: Wait a minute .
KUJAN: I do n't have a minute . Are you saying it was Keyser Soze ? You told the D.A . you did n't know who it was .
VERBAL: I - there had to be dope there .
KUJAN: Do n't shine me , Verbal . No more stalling . You know what I 'm getting at .
VERBAL: I do n't .
VERBAL: I do n't know what you 're talking about .
VERBAL: I do n't understand what you 're saying . I saw Keaton get shot , I swear to you .
KUJAN: Then why did n't you help him ?
VERBAL: I WAS AFRAID , OKAY ? Somehow , I was sure it was Keyser Soze at that point . I could n't bring myself to raise my gun to him .
KUJAN: But Keaton
VERBAL: It was Keyser Soze , Agent Kujan . I mean the Devil himself . How do you shoot the Devil in the back ?
KUJAN: Arturo Marquez . Ever hear of him ?
VERBAL: Wha- No .
KUJAN: He was a stool pigeon for the Justice Department . He swore out a statement to Federal Marshals that he had seen and could positively identify one Keyser Soze and had intimate knowledge of his usiness , including , but not exclusive to , drug trafficking and murder .
VERBAL: I never heard of him .
KUJAN: His own people were selling him to a gang of Hungarians . Most likely the same Hungarians that Sate all but wiped out ack in Turkey . The money was n't there for dope . The Hungarians were going to uy the one guy that could finger Soze for them .
VERBAL: I said I never heard of him .
KUJAN: But Keaton had . Edie Finneran was his extradition advisor . She knew who he was and what he knew .
VERBAL: I do n't
KUJAN: There were no drugs on that boat . It was a hit . A suicide mission to whack out the one man that could finger Keyser Soze so Sate had a few thieves put to it . Men he knew he could march into certain death .
KUJAN: I 'm saying Keaton did .
VERBAL: He wanted me to live .
KUJAN: Why did he want you to live ? A one-time dirty cop without a loyalty in the world finds it in his heart to save a worthless at-cripple ? No , sir . Why '
VERBAL: Edie .
KUJAN: I do n't buy that reform story for a minute . And even if I did , I certainly do n't believe he would send you to protect her . So why ?
VERBAL: Because he was my friend .
KUJAN: No , Verbal . You were n't friends . Keaton did n't have friends . He saved you because he wanted it that way . It was his will .
VERBAL: No
KUJAN: Keaton was Keyser Soze
VERBAL: NO .
KUJAN: The kind of guy who could wrangle the wills of men like Hockney and McManus . The kind of man who could engineer a police line-up from all his years of contacts in N.Y.P.D .
VERBAL: NO , NO , NO , NO , NO .
