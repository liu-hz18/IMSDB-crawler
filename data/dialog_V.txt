DASCOMBE: The time has come , London , to eturn to a bygone age , an age of tradition , an age of values that have been disparaged and all but forgotten . What this country needs is a leader ! A true leader to emind us of that age . A righteous leader with the strength of his moral convictions to do what must e done . I give you that man ! I give you our leader ! Adam Susan !
LITTLE EVEY: Mommy ?
MOTHER: My daughter ! Do n't take my daughter !
FATHER: Evey ! Evey !
LITTLE EVEY: Mommy ! Daddy !
EVEY: Excuse me ? Uh excuse me , Mister ?
MAN: That is the clumsiest bit of propositioning I 've ever heard .
EVEY: Oh god , I 'm sorry .
MAN: Is this your first time , darling ?
EVEY: Yes , no , I mean for money . But I know what you want and I 'll do it .
MAN: No . You do n't know what you 're doing .
EVEY: Christ , you 're a Fingerman .
FINGERMAN 1: Give the little lady a prize .
FINGERMAN 2: I 've got something to give her .
FINGERMAN 1: Prostitution is a class H offense . Know what that means ? It means that we get to exercise our own judicial discretion
FINGERMAN 2: And you get to swallow it .
EVEY: Oh god , please . It 's my first time . Please do n't hurt me .
FINGERMAN 1: Gosh , fellas , look at those big innocent eyes . What do you think ?
FINGERMAN 3: Spare the rod , spoil the child .
EVEY: Oh no !
FINGERMAN 3: You heard the man , sweetie . This od 's for your own good .
FINGERMAN 3: What the hell
FINGERMAN 1: We 're police officers , pal .
FINGERMAN 4: We 're with the Finger .
FINGERMAN 3: So bugger off !
FINGERMAN 1: He 's got a knife !
FINGERMAN 3: Jesus Christ ! Do n't hurt me !
EVEY: Who Who are you ?
EVEY: Evey .
EVEY: Why did you do that ? Why did you help me ?
EVEY: For what ?
EVEY: Music ?
EVEY: Is that why you 're wearing a mask ?
EVEY: Uh November fourth .
EVEY: I do n't know .
EVEY: To your music ?
EVEY: I ca n't hear anything .
EVEY: Oh my
LEADER: Gentlemen , I will hear your reports now . Mr. Heyer , speak for the Eye .
CONRAD: We have less than two minutes of usable footage , Leader . It took the suspect less than a minute to dispatch the Finger 's vice patrol .
LEADER: Freeze it !
CONRAD: I 'm afraid the mask makes retinal identification impossible .
LEADER: Mr. Etheridge , report for the Ear !
ETHERIDGE: We were able to triangulate the origin of the fireworks . We also are currently monitoring a lot of phone surveillance indicating a high percentage of conversation concerned with the explosions . All suspect or significant transcripts are being forwarded to Mr. Almond .
LEADER: Very good . Mr. Finch , speak fo the Nose .
FINCH: Thanks to Etheridge , we found the launch for the fireworks . These appear to be individually weighted flares and we have found traces of the same chemicals at both of the detonation sites which leads us to conclude that , despite a level of sophistication , these devices are all home-made with over the counte chemicals , making them impossible to trace . Whoever he is , Leader , he 's good .
LEADER: Thank you for that professional annotation .
ALMOND: Uh the Fate computer system , sir ?
LEADER: No . No sir . It 's more than that . This , this computer is a symbol , Mr. Almond . A symbol of the highest attainable goal of mankind . Do you know what that goal is , Mr. Almond ?
ALMOND: We lost control .
LEADER: Yes , Mr. Almond . Last night someone did the unthinkable . Someone hurt us . It is imperative that we act swiftly and precisely . I want that man found , Mr. Almond . I want his head or , by god , I 'll have yours .
EVEY: Wait . I 've lost you .
EVEY: Oh
EVEY: Oh , it 's beautiful . I 've neve heard anything like it .
EVEY: This place is amazing .
EVEY: Stay here with you ?
EVEY: I I do n't even know your name .
EVEY: V ? V I like that .
PROTHERO: Good morning , London . This is the voice of Fate Damn .
DASCOMBE: Would someone get his lordship his loody tea ?
PROTHERO: I know . I know . Damned inconvenient this entire affair . Fine . Let 's try again .
DASCOMBE: It 's not our job to believe it , Lewis . Our job is to tell the people
PROTHERO: `` Exactly what they tell us . '' I Know but do you think that people will believe it ?
DASCOMBE: They will if it 's you that 's telling it to them . Now let 's try it again .
PROTHERO: `` Remember , remember , the fifth of November ''
BODYGUARD 1: Sir , who did what , sir ?
PROTHERO: Guy Fawkes . He tried to blow up Parliament .
BODYGUARD 1: Sir , we 're both straight military , sir .
BODYGUARD 2: Sir , yes , sir . I was fighting in Ireland by the time I was sixteen .
PROTHERO: Yes , of course . My mistake .
BODYGUARD 1: What the hell 's that !
BODYGUARD 2: The train 's doing almost seventy . It would break his legs .
BODYGUARD 1: You 're right , I It must have een rags .
PROTHERO: Get off of me !
BODYGUARD 2: What the fuck is going on ?
BODYGUARD 1: Lock the car doors .
PROTHERO: I have a lighter somewhere
BODYGUARD 2: I ca n't find the lock wait . Hey wha
BODYGUARD 1: What 's happening
PROTHERO: I found it !
PROTHERO: What What did you call me ?
PROTHERO: I do n't know what you 're talking about .
PROTHERO: Her .
PROTHERO: Oh no , no ! Please I was just doing what I was told !
PROTHERO: Please , do n't make me do this
PROTHERO: I 'll see you in hell .
TRAIN MAN: This door 's locked !
PROTHERO: Fi Fi Fi
DOMINIC: What do you make of this , Mr. Finch ?
FINCH: Hmm . It 's a rose . A violet carson , I believe . Strange .
DOMINIC: Strange ?
FINCH: I did n't think they still existed .
SOLDIER: Mr. Finch ! Sir !
FINCH: Now ?
SOLDIER: Yes , sir . I 'm to transport you immediately .
FINCH: Send the rose to the lab . Also , scrape a sample of this paint and have it analyzed as well . I 'll be ack as soon as I can .
LEADER: Ah , Mr. Finch . I sent for you ecause what I have to say can not e said over a phone or a radio . What I have to say can not leave these four walls . Do I make myself clear ?
FINCH: Yes , sir .
LEADER: I believe in a few things , Mr. Finch . I believe in god . I elieve in the destiny of the Nordic race . And I believe in fascism . The romans invented fascism . They had a symbol for it ; a bundle of twigs bound together . One twig could be broken but a undle would prevail . That is the heart and soul of fascism . Strength in unity . I tell you these things knowing full well that they make you uncomfortable .
FINCH: Well , I
LEADER: You have in fact expressed you discomfort in several arrest eports , arrests that were , in you opinion , `` unnecessary . '' The fact that you are here , that you are not otting in a prison cell , is a mark of my respect and admiration fo you , for your craft , and for what you have done for this country .
FINCH: You think he 's an insider ?
LEADER: What I think is that this man must e stopped . Stopped at all costs and no one , I repeat , no one is to e placed above suspicion . Do I make myself clear ?
FINCH: Perfectly .
LEADER: England prevails , Mr. Finch .
FINCH: England prevails .
EVEY: V , v , v , v , v .
EVEY: Oh , V , you scared me .
EVEY: Yes , I suppose you have . This place is the only universe I have ight now .
EVEY: I do n't know . I 'm so grateful to you I just feel I should help you , you know , the way you 're helping me . I mean , that 's the deal , is n't it ?
EVEY: I think I do . Part of me wants to stay here forever and never have to face what 's going on outside . But that 's not right . Is it ? That 's not taking responsibility . Not conquering my universe .
EVEY: Good . That 's that , then .
CONRAD: Hello , Rosemary . Derek , how
HELEN: Derek !
ROSEMARY: Hello .
DEREK: It 's so good to see you . Since this bloody terrorist business , the old man has me literally chained to the office .
HELEN: Oh , you poor dear .
DEREK: It comes with the job . How are things in the Eye , Conrad ?
CONRAD: Well , we 've been working some bugs out of the new Mark IX fiber optic network , actually
HELEN: Oh , Conrad , do n't be such a bloody ore. Do tell us about the terrorist , Derek . Is it true he lew up Big Ben and the old Bailey ?
DEREK: I 'm afraid so . We 're dealing with a pathological psychotic in the most extreme case . We 'll catch him though . I promise .
HELEN: Oh , it sounds dreadfully exciting . Are n't you glad you 've got such a uthless , implacable brute for a husband , Rosemary ?
ROSEMARY: Yes , well
HELEN: Believe me , you 're lucky . You could be struck with a professional peeping tom like Conrad . England 's highest paid voyeur , are n't you darling ?
CONRAD: Helen , I think we 'd better
HELEN: Oh yes , of course . We have to get ack so the little pervert can watch what the neighbors do afte Sunday lunch . He 's so exciting .
DEREK: Goodbye , Helen . Conrad .
ROSEMARY: She 's a bit hard on him , is n't she ?
DEREK: Until you 're half the woman of Helen 's sophistication , I 'd keep your little mouth shut .
LILLIMAN: Ah , there they go . My happy and contented flock . Spiritually efreshed and ready to face the world again .
DENNIS: Very inspiring , your grace . Though the segue of the forces of Satan among us did strike me as a bit of a curious digression .
LILLIMAN: Hmm , yes . A trifle purple , I thought . Still , Fate wanted it included and who are we to question the will of the almighty , miserable sinners that we are ?
DENNIS: Perhaps pride , your grace .
LILLIMAN: I was thinking of something a little less ethereal . Has the young lady arrived ?
DENNIS: The agency informed me she 'll be here directly . However , there was a mixup . It 's not one of the usual girls . She 's a little older .
LILLIMAN: Oh dear . Oh dear . Not too old , I trust ?
DENNIS: They promise me she 's no more than fifteen .
LILLIMAN: Fifteen , hmm .
DENNIS: Yes , your grace .
LILLIMAN: Oh my !
EVEY: Uh thank you .
LILLIMAN: Of course , `` hate the sin , love the sinner . '' I always say . Take you dress off , please .
EVEY: Listen I was kind of hoping
LILLIMAN: You You filthy whore !
LILLIMAN: Dennis ?
EVEY: V ?
EVEY: Oh no .
EVEY: Oh god , V. I ca n't I ca n't
OPERATOR 1: Bloody hell . Does n't anybody fuck with feeling anymore ?
OPERATOR 2: Hey , it 's Sunday . Children 's hou over at the Abbey .
OPERATOR 1: Let 's see what that filthy old pervert is up to .
VOICE 1: And I saw a black shape against the flames . Oh god . It 's you . The man from room five . You 've come
VOICE 2: To collect what 's mine .
VOICE 1: I beg you ! I do n't want to die ! Please have mercy !
OPERATOR 1: Get me the Finger . This is an emergency !
DOMINIC: No prints yet , sir . Just like Prothero .
FINCH: I want those tapes from the Ear in my office tonight , Dominic .
DOMINIC: Yes , sir . They 're on top of it .
FINCH: Any word from your superior , Mr. Creedy ?
CREEDY: Mr. Almond does n't seem to be answering his page , sir . I 'm sure he 's in the field .
FINCH: Quite .
HELEN: There you go , baby . Now my baby oy can think so much clearer . Ca n't he ?
DEREK: Everyone is so worried about the terrorist . Especially Susan . You know why ? Because nobody knows what he 's going to do .
HELEN: No . You 're kidding .
DEREK: Am I ?
HELEN: You 're serious , are n't you ?
DEREK: You need to be careful , Helen . Your mouth is going to get you into trouble one day .
HELEN: Is that the same trouble you love putting in my mouth ?
DEREK: You never know who might be listening .
HELEN: I know , Derek . You love you country and you love your party , just like you love your wife .
DOMINIC: Sorry it took so long . The boys had a devil of a time trying to filter out the background noise .
FINCH: Background noise ?
DOMINIC: The perpetrator apparently turned on the Bishop 's stereo . Subsequently , a great deal of the tape is useless .
FINCH: What music did he play ?
DOMINIC: Beethoven . The fifth , I believe .
FINCH: Da , da , da , dum . That 's code . Morse code .
DOMINIC: Sir ?
FINCH: For the letter `` V '' .
DOMINIC: No . The agency said somebody claiming to be Lilliman 's valet canceled his Sunday appointment .
FINCH: What is it ?
DOMINIC: 23rd Psalm .
FINCH: He made him eat a host .
DOMINIC: Yes , listen to this part .
FINCH: And then just Beethoven 's fifth .
DELIA: Do you have a motive ?
FINCH: Just lives .
DELIA: Well
FINCH: Bloody hell .
DELIA: There were hundreds of different chemicals in him . From trinitrotoluene to estrogen to motor oil .
FINCH: Perhaps Fate will make something more of all this . I certainly ca n't .
DELIA: The Leader finally authorized an uplink for you ? He must be getting nervous .
FINCH: Quite . Government directed terrorism never sews healthy ideas into the public . Oh , that reminds me .
DELIA: Yes Yes , of course .
FINCH: Magic . I 'll drop by tomorrow then .
CREEDY: What 's all this , then , Harper ? I get a radio that a man 's down and in need of assistance ?
HARPER: I ai n't gone down yet but I sure do need some assistance .
CREEDY: Are you flat broke already ?
LOUT: How 'd you sneak away , Creedy ? Almond off buggering that blonde chippy ?
HARPER: The one with the tits ?
CREEDY: What I would n't give for a piece of that .
LOUT: She could serve a tray of drinks on those thingies .
HARPER: I bet you get your chance with he sooner than later , Creedy , with the way Almond 's crackin ' up .
LOUT: Bloody bugger 's losing his marbles .
HARPER: Terrorist or no , if that bastard gives me another double shift , I 'll stomp his fucking head .
CREEDY: Aye . This nonsense has put a serious strain on my drinking . I think I was actually sober today .
LOUT: I 'll drink to that .
HARPER: We need to get a real man of the people in that director 's position . Like Creedy here .
CREEDY: Well , it 's good to know when the shit hits the fan who your real friends are .
ROSEMARY: Derek
DEREK: I do n't want to hear it , Rosemary .
ROSEMARY: Derek , please ! We ca n't carry on like this .
DEREK: I do n't have to take any crap from you ! I have that fat bastard iding me all day . I do n't want to listen to you , so shut your fat gob !
DOMINIC: I got it !
FINCH: A connection ?
DOMINIC: Larkhill Resettlement Camp . Prothero 's and Lilliman 's employment records show they both help positions there at simila times .
FINCH: What about codename V ?
DOMINIC: Most of Larkhill 's records were destroyed for security reasons but I did uncover an old standard procedures and operations manual .
FINCH: Five is the letter V. Brilliant , Dominic .
DELIA: Roses .
DELIA: Oh thank god . Thank god .
FINCH: Oh my god .
DOMINIC: He 's killed them all ? It 's not possible .
FINCH: Oh no .
DELIA: No , no . I thought I would be , but I 'm not . I 'm
ROSEMARY: Derek ? What ?
DEREK: Bang .
CREEDY: You look lost .
EVEY: No I made a mistake .
CREEDY: Well I did n't like the looks of you anyway
DELIA: It 's funny , I was given one of you oses today . I was n't sure you were the terrorist until I saw it .
DELIA: Then you are going to kill me now ?
DELIA: Is there any pain ?
DELIA: Thank you .
DEREK: Do n't move an inch , you bloody astard .
DEREK: Horrible ! God , it 's horrible !
FINCH: Delia ?
EVEY: Oh no V ?
DOMINIC: I 'm sorry , sir . You knew the doctor pretty well ?
PROTHERO: Next .
DELIA: And napalm .
FINCH: That 's the last entry until six months later when Dr. Surridge is ack in London . There is no mention of the man in room five again . End of story .
LEADER: Enough !
FINCH: Yes , Leader .
LEADER: Dismissed . England prevails , Mr. Finch .
FINCH: No , Leader . Not yet .
MAN: Wake up , cow .
GUARD 1: Tsk . This pathetic whore is the famous Miss Hammond ?
EVEY: You 've made a mistake .
ROSSITER: Shut up .
EVEY: Please . I have n't done anything
ROSSITER: I said shut your hole !
EVEY: No , please , I did n't do anything .
ROSSITER: Shut up .
EVEY: Please . I did n't do anything .
ROSSITER: It 's time , unless you want to change your mind .
EVEY: Thank you but I 'd rather die behind the chemical sheds .
ROSSITER: Then there 's nothing left to threaten you with , is there ? You are free .
EVEY: What ?
EVEY: You
EVEY: Love ?
EVEY: Shut up ! I do n't want to hear it . I was n't in a prison . I was happy ! I was happy here
EVEY: That 's warped ! That 's evil and it 's wrong ! What gives you the ight to judge ? Who are you to say what 's not good enough ? !
EVEY: Shut up ! You 're mad ! I do n't want to hear it !
EVEY: I ca n't feel anything ! There 's nothing left to feel ! Do n't you understand ?
EVEY: I do n't know what Oh god I ca n't breathe
EVEY: What are you doing to me ? I ca n't eathe
EVEY: I feel I feel like I 'm going to urst .
EVEY: Oh god I felt
EVEY: The roof ? Outside ?
EVEY: Everything 's so different .
DASCOMBE: Finch !
FINCH: No , but I can guess .
DASCOMBE: What ?
FINCH: `` Remember , remember , the fifth of November . ''
DASCOMBE: Oh come on . He 's long gone . He has to be . He did what he came to do and it 's over .
FINCH: Not for us .
LEADER: I have given you almost a year and you have given me nothing . Nothing !
DASCOMBE: Now Adam , there is no one bette than Finch and you know it .
LEADER: Yes , Mr. Dascombe , I do know it . It is that very fact that keeps me awake at night , wondering if perhaps there is a reason that Mr. Finch has failed .
FINCH: What are you saying ?
LEADER: I 'm saying that perhaps I do n't know you as well as I thought I did .
FINCH: Are you asking for my resignation ?
LEADER: No , I am asking for some goddamn esults !
DASCOMBE: It 's not Finch 's fault , Adam .
CONRAD: We 've all been looking . The man simply disappeared .
ETHERIDGE: Vanished .
DASCOMBE: He 's gone , Adam . It 's over .
LEADER: It 's over , is it ? He 's gone . Vanished , you say ?
DASCOMBE: For god 's sake , Adam , it 's a stupid variety show .
LEADER: Mr. Creedy , I want the producers , writers , and actors of that `` stupid variety show '' arrested and charged with sedition .
CREEDY: Yes , sir .
DASCOMBE: You ca n't be serious
LEADER: Push me , Roger , push me and you 'll find out how serious I am .
CREEDY: I , uh , appreciate your faith in me .
LEADER: Your predecessor , Mr. Almond , was a good man , a man who understood what strength in unity meant , a man who , above all , loved his country . I need to know if you are such a man .
CREEDY: Oh god , yes !
HELEN: `` The most important member of my cabinet . '' Yes it is , is n't it , dear ?
CREEDY: Oh , do n't stop .
HELEN: I stop when you stop . What did he say next ?
CREEDY: I ca n't
HELEN: Come on , Peter , what are you afraid of ? Almond used to tell me everything and you 're twice the man he was .
CREEDY: He asked me if I loved my country .
HELEN: Oh yes , I can tell you do love you country , almost as much as you love this
CREEDY: Oh god
HELEN: Go on .
CREEDY: Then he asked me to do something oh , oh
HELEN: What ?
CREEDY: Helen , I ca n't . I ca n't tell you .
HELEN: He told you to frame someone as the terrorist .
CREEDY: My god ? ! How did you know that ?
HELEN: I know Adam Susan . Now who was it ?
CREEDY: No way . I ca n't tell you that .
HELEN: Yes you can , honey . You can and you will . You have to trust me , love . We 're going to help each other .
CREEDY: Helen , please .
HELEN: Look at that face . You see ? You 're just bursting to tell me .
CREEDY: It was Fi Fi FINCH !
EVEY: That was beautiful .
EVEY: It was a good backdrop . I believed it . I really did . It 's still a it hard for me to accept that it was n't real . That it was just you . Especially the letter .
EVEY: What ?
EVEY: Valerie ?
EVEY: She 's beautiful .
EVEY: Roses . You grew them for her .
EVEY: They 're beautiful .
EVEY: Two days before the first day we met .
EVEY: You 're planning something , are n't you , V ?
EVEY: What are you going to do ?
EVEY: I 've never been here before .
EVEY: Oh , V , it 's lovely . Where on earth did you find it ?
EVEY: What 's in these packages ?
EVEY: What are you going to do with all of it ?
EVEY: Where does this train go ?
EVEY: Whitehall V , that 's the New Government Building .
LEADER: Yes , Mr. Creedy ?
CREEDY: Everything 's set , sir . No worries .
LEADER: When ?
CREEDY: Tonight .
ANNOUNCER: Tonight on Tales from the Bible , a story of treachery and betrayal from the Book of Daniel .
DASCOMBE: All of London 's waiting . Ready , two . And here we go
ANNOUNCER: Tonight , England 's greatest hero epels the forces of darkness in a and new episode .
HEIDI: Oh , Storm . Save me ! Save me !
STORM: You mongrel trash , if you harm her !
MONGREL TRASH: Look out , de white debil has a laser lugar !
GUARD: Hey , what the ?
HEIDI: Oh Storm , hold me . Hold me tight .
FINCH: I do n't know how you stand that tripe .
DOMINIC: Es gooh .
FINCH: Do n't you see , Dominic ?
GUARD: Bloody hell !
DOMINIC: Creedy ? What the hell 's going on ?
CREEDY: I 'm here to arrest Mr. Finch fo acts of treason and terrorism .
DOMINIC: You ca n't be serious .
CREEDY: If I were you , boy , I 'd shut my hole unless you want to start explaining why you did n't say nothing about Mr. Finch 's secret identity .
FINCH: Why do n't you just shoot me , Creedy ? Would n't that make everything a lot simpler ?
CREEDY: Yeah , I suppose it would .
DOMINIC: Holy Christ ! Creedy , you stupid ape ! If Finch is V then tell me who is that ?
CREEDY: Bloody fuckin ' hell .
FINCH: He has to be at Jordan tower . Come on !
CREEDY: Do n't just stand there ! Follow them !
LEADER: Damn you ! Damn you !
MOTHER: Hush . Turn it up .
LEADER: I want this man dead ! I want him shot on sight !
CAPTAIN: Yes , sir .
LEADER: Who was it ? Who was he ?
CAPTAIN: Sir , I think there has been a mistake .
LEADER: No ! There is no mistake !
CAPTAIN: But sir , there are people that say they saw both the terrorist and Dascombe together
LEADER: Who ? Who are these people ? They must be detained immediately . Whatever they saw or whatever they think they saw is subordinate to the truth and that truth is that Roger Dascombe is the terrorist and the terrorist is dead !
FINCH: But I thought I was the terrorist .
LEADER: Finch , what are you doing here ?
FINCH: Since I 'm not in jail and since you have another , even more convenient suspect . I 'm guessing the charges have been dropped .
LEADER: Be careful , Finch .
FINCH: I am careful , sir . Always . That is why I suggest that a search of this building begin immediately .
LEADER: The terrorist is dead !
FINCH: With all due respect , I disagree and I believe that he is presently trying to get out of this building disguised as one of us .
LEADER: Are you challenging my authority ?
FINCH: No sir , I 'm trying to run an investigation
LEADER: I am trying to run a country ! When I tell you , Mr. Finch , the terrorist is dead , then the terrorist is dead ! If you continue to suggest otherwise then you will leave me no choice but to have you arrested on charges of sedition . Do I make myself clear ?
SPEAKERS: The terrorist is dead . No furthe threat exists . Everything is unde control .
LITTLE GIRL: Bollocks .
FINCH: Play it again .
DOMINIC: Come on , Finch . We 've seen it fifty times . I mean , after what they done to you , I do n't know why we 're even trying to stop him .
FINCH: I do n't know . For twenty seven years , I 've been at this job . Twenty seven years , I 've done what I 've been told to do . Maybe that 's all there is to it . I 'm just a dumb old dog . A dumb old dog that only knows one trick .
DOMINIC: That ai n't it , Finch . It 's more than that . I know you . It 's something personal with this one .
FINCH: Maybe . And maybe I 'm not ready fo a revolution .
DOMINIC: Well , we got less than thirty hours to stop it .
FINCH: We will .
DOMINIC: How ?
FINCH: It 's on the tape . I know it . I can feel it . He did this for a eason . He needs something .
DOMINIC: What ?
FINCH: The line of the Queen ?
DOMINIC: But what does that mean ?
FINCH: Maybe it 's a line from Shakespeare . Or a book . I do n't know .
FINCH: But right here . He 's talking to someone . Someone specific . Someone who knows what he wants .
CONRAD: Helen ? Helen , why did you want that tape ?
HELEN: Shut up , Conrad . I 'm thinking .
HELEN: How ? How did you know that ?
CONRAD: Know what , my love ?
HELEN: All right . You have a deal .
ASSISTANT DIRECTOR: Ready in five , Leader .
LEADER: Good evening London . As Leader of this great country , I felt it imperative to speak with you and to assure you once and for all that the shadow that recently fell across our land has indeed passed .
WOMAN: Oh , for fuck 's sake .
LEADER: What we have endured this long yea was no accident , no mere coincidence . This was not a simple act of terror conducted by a singular madman . No , this was a test .
DRUNK: Remember fifth of November !
LEADER: How do I know this ? Let me read to you where I found the answer , where I so often find the answer . In the Scripture . Revelations .
EVEY: Oh , V , turn it off , please .
EVEY: What is that , V ?
CREEDY: What about Conrad ?
HELEN: I told you , I 'll handle Conrad and V will take care of Susan . The mo will take care of the guard and then You can use the Finger to take over .
CREEDY: Use the Finger ? You mean like this ?
HELEN: Oh oh that is vulgar
CREEDY: But you like it ?
HELEN: Yes , oh yes , oh you 're a pig , Peter
CREEDY: That I am , misses . But I 'm the pig that 's gon na be running this country .
HELEN: Yes and I 'm I 'm going to be Eva Oh Eva
FINCH: Eighteen hours .
DOMINIC: But I 've still got over three hundred lines from The Fairy Queen .
FINCH: Forget it . There 's no more time . You go home and get some rest . You 're going to need it tonight .
DOMINIC: He 's got us , does n't he , Finch ?
FINCH: Yes , he does .
HELEN: Now listen to me , Conrad . This is the most important moment of ou lives . Everything I 've worked and hoped for comes to this . Susan is a very dangerous man , especially now , that 's why I need you , Conrad . I need you to be stronger than him . I need you to be the better man . Understand ?
CONRAD: Oh , Helen .
HELEN: Not on the lips .
FINCH: Give it up , old man . You 're not even sure you want to stop him .
LEADER: His wife ?
HELEN: Leader , I 'm terribly sorry but I absolutely must speak with you .
LEADER: Now what 's this all about , Mrs. Heyer ?
HELEN: Please , forgive me . I 've been so afraid , afraid to come here to talk to you . I thought he must know . I was terrified he knew but I had to come because I knew you were the only one that can protect me .
LEADER: Protect you from what ?
HELEN: You wo n't let him hurt me , will you ?
LEADER: Let who hurt you ?
HELEN: The terrorist .
LEADER: The terrorist is dead .
HELEN: Oh , how I wanted to believe it , Leader , but I know it 's not true .
LEADER: How ?
HELEN: Because I know who the terrorist is .
LEADER: Who ? Who is it , woman ?
HELEN: It 's Conrad , Leader . Conrad . My husband is the terrorist .
LEADER: What ? !
HELEN: I saw him , Leader . In the middle of the night . I heard something . I went to the landing and that 's when I saw it .
LEADER: But how did you know it was Heyer ?
HELEN: I know , Leader . I know the way a woman knows .
LEADER: But you have no proof ?
HELEN: Proof ?
LEADER: Yes , proof ? This is an extremely delicate situation , Mrs. Heyer . It has been reported that the terrorist is dead . It would be a catastrophe to arrest a man now without concrete , conclusive proof . Do you have any evidence at all ?
HELEN: Leader ! Wait !
CONRAD: Is everything all right ? Helen ?
LEADER: Yes , Mr. Heyer , your wife has done her duty to her country .
CONRAD: Investigation of what ?
LEADER: Subversion , Mr. Heyer . Your wife was privy to the dialogue of subversives . That 's all you need to know at this time . Lieutenant !
HELEN: Thank you , sir .
CONRAD: Yes , Helen .
HELEN: Oh , Conrad , I 'm so proud of you .
CONRAD: I did it , Helen . I did it , did n't
HELEN: Tonight , Conrad .
CONRAD: Tonight .
HELEN: I promise you will never forget tonight .
GUARD: Mr. Heyer ! Mr. Heyer !
CONRAD: Yes ?
GUARD: Sir , this package arrived for you , sir .
CONRAD: Thank you .
FINCH: Oh my god .
LIEUTENANT: Yes , but he 's meeting with the Captain of the Guard .
FINCH: Perfect .
LIEUTENANT: Mr. Finch , you ca n't go in
LEADER: Mr. Finch ?
FINCH: Leader , I need as many men the Captain can spare and I need them ight now .
CAPTAIN: What for ?
FINCH: To capture codename V .
LEADER: I 'm coming with you .
GUARD: Sir
LEADER: There will be no discussion
GUARD: But if Mr. Finch is right
LEADER: I am sick to death of this terrorist being everywhere and nowhere ! I will judge whether Mr. Finch is right and I will judge it with my own eyes ! Do I make myself clear , Captain ?
CAPTAIN: Sir , yes , sir !
LEADER: Is there a problem , Mr. Finch ?
FINCH: No no sir .
LEADER: Good . Captain , mobilize your men .
CAPTAIN: Sir , yes , sir .
LEADER: We 'll find this bloody bastard and we will finish him .
EVEY: V ?
EVEY: V , what 's going to happen ?
EVEY: Is it going to be violent ?
EVEY: But why ? Why must is be violent ?
EVEY: What is the other face , V ?
EVEY: Yes , V ?
EVEY: Of course .
EVEY: Tell me .
EVEY: It would be my pleasure .
EVEY: All it takes is a little practice .
EVEY: V ? What are you going to do ?
EVEY: You 're coming back though , are n't you ?
EVEY: Just promise .
LEADER: Mark my words , Mr. Finch , this man is going to become an example so that every man , woman , and child in this country will remember what happens to those who would eve think to stand against the state .
FINCH: I do n't think that will be necessary .
LEADER: There are over one hundred of the est trained soldiers in this country down here . Let him come .
CAPTAIN: They lost him .
FINCH: This this is a mistake .
LEADER: Do n't tell me you 're a coward , Mr. Finch .
FINCH: Leader , we have to get out of here !
LEADER: This was your idea .
FINCH: It was a mistake . This is what he wants . He knows us , Leader . He knows us too well . We have to get out of here before it 's too late
LEADER: What trick is this ?
CAPTAIN: Fall back . Fall back and secure the central platform .
LEADER: Any man that disobeys this orde will be court marshaled !
CAPTAIN: You ! You ! Point position . We 're getting out of here ! Now !
LEADER: Traitors ! You cowards !
LEADER: Damn you ! Damn you !
LEADER: Noooo !
FINCH: Do n't move !
LEADER: Mr. Finch ! Oh god , Mr. Finch !
FINCH: Drop the knife .
LEADER: Oh , I knew it , Mr. Finch . I knew you would n't desert me . You 're a good man , Finch . A damn good man .
FINCH: No , Mr. Susan . No , I 'm not . I 'm a man who does his job and does what he 's told . For twenty seven years , that 's all I 've been .
LEADER: Careful , Mr. Finch . He 's quick as the devil .
FINCH: I 've read Delia 's diary over and over all year . It sickens me but I am unable to judge her . I am as guilty as she .
LEADER: Mr. Finch , what are you doing ? Shoot him . Kill the bastard , Finch .
FINCH: I have no excuse . I did what I was told to do .
LEADER: Finch , I order you to shoot him ! Finch !
FINCH: My job was to find you and catch you . I 've done my job . I 've done it for the last time . I 'm tired of it . I 'm tired of it all .
LEADER: I warned you , Finch , the penalty for treason is death .
LEADER: Do you really believe you can pick up that knife before I pull this trigger ?
HELEN: Creedy ? Creedy , you dumb bastard , you left your car parked in front .
CONRAD: Helen
HELEN: Conrad ! What have you done ?
CONRAD: I won , Helen . I did it . I won . I 'm the better man .
HELEN: Do n't touch me ! You stupid piece of shit ! You 've ruined it ! I had it all planned perfectly and you 've uined it !
CONRAD: Helen
HELEN: No ! Let go ! Now !
CONRAD: No , Helen , you 're not leaving me not this time not ever .
HELEN: No , please ! Oh god , no ! Oh god , please help me !
CONRAD: No one can help us , Helen . God is dead .
EVEY: V ?
EVEY: You need a doctor .
EVEY: No , do n't say that !
EVEY: Yes , they need you , V .
EVEY: What ?
EVEY: I do n't understand .
EVEY: I promise .
EVEY: V , you are not going anywhere !
EVEY: You 're not going to die , V !
EVEY: I wo n't let you die !
EVEY: V !
SERGEANT: Return to your homes ! There is nothing to see ! The terrorist is dead !
EVEY: I wo n't let you die .
TRESCKOW: Managing the Führer 's security must e quite an undertaking .
BRANDT: Irregularity is the Führer 's precaution of choice .
TRESCKOW: I can assure you he 's safe here . Relax , Brandt . Enjoy your meal .
BRANDT: Cointreau ? You better hope I do n't get thirsty on the flight .
TRESCKOW: He 's landed .
AIDE: What about the Tresckow is already dialing the telephone .
TRESCKOW: Get me Colonel Brandt Colonel ? Tresckow I trust you landed safely I hate to trouble you but there 's been a bit of a mix up . It seems you have the wrong ottles for Colonel Stieff . You do still have the package ? Long pause . Torture . Then
AIDE: Do you think he knows ?
TRESCKOW: There 's only one way to be sure
OFFICER: What happened ?
TRESCKOW: I can only guess the altitude caused the fuse to malfunction . First the beer hall , Memorial Day - now this . Someone is watching ove that sonofabitch , I swear it .
OLBRICHT: We 've been discovered .
TRESCKOW: What makes you think-
OLBRICHT: Oster 's been arrested . The Gestapo came for him last night .
TRESCKOW: The Gestapo could have arrested him for anything . Find a replacement .
OLBRICHT: There 's no one we can trust . Not in Berlin .
TRESCKOW: Then stop looking in Berlin .
SENTRY: Your pistol please .
BRANDT: You 'll forgive me , General . This little round-up has had me writing eports all day .
TRESKOW: Round-up ?
BRANDT: Dissenters . A plot against the Führer .
TRESKOW: Who would even have the balls ?
BRANDT: You 'd be surprised , the number of cowards in this army that would be willing to stand against the Reich .
TRESKOW: Only if the Führer were dead , of course .
BRANDT: Of course . It 's one thing to think you know what 's right . What matters is having the strength to do it .
TRESCKOW: I beg your pardon . Brandt sits back , smiles . Does he know ?
BRANDT: You 've come a long way . You must be thirsty .
TRESCKOW: I wonder how the Führer , who does not partake , would feel about an officer who did so on duty Colonel Brandt .
BRANDT: I took you for another sort , General .
TRESCKOW: And I you .
YOUNG LIEUTENANT: Colonel Stauffenberg , sir . A new headquarters has been established at Mezzouna . I 'm to take you there .
STAUFFENBERG: Now they tell us to disengage - a day late . No matter how many times we tell Command the reality , they always manage to leave us- But he stops himself , containing his rage .
YOUNG LIEUTENANT: Colonel , the enemy is less than five kilometers from here . You 've done all you can .
STAUFFENBERG: I wonder Was there even a point in our coming to Tunis ?
YOUNG LIEUTENANT: To get taken prisoner , it seems .
STAUFFENBERG: STOP . WAIT UNTIL THEY COMMIT .
DOCTOR: Mrs. Stauffenberg ?
NINA: The Colonel 's brother , Berthold .
DOCTOR: Perhaps before you see the Colonel we should go to my office and-
NINA: I will see my husband now .
DOCTOR: He 's been constant with fever but he refuses any pain killers . The ight hand has been amputated above the wrist . He 's lost the fourth and fifth fingers on the left . We could n't save the left eye . Berthold covers his face . Nina is a rock .
NINA: His ring .
DOCTOR: I don't-
NINA: He had a ring on his right hand . Where is it ?
DOCTOR: I 'm sorry His hand was amputated in the field I 'm afraid-
NINA: Thank you .
BERTHOLD: We 've lost North Africa . CLOSE ON That one eye staring at us closes .
STAUFFENBERG: I do n't know what I ever did with ten .
OLBRICHT: We could use your help .
STAUFFENBERG: I 'm a field officer . Olbricht steps closer , speaking openly now .
OLBRICHT: This war ca n't be won in the field .
STAUFFENBERG: That 's unfortunate for me .
OLBRICHT: You ca n't honestly believe you 'll make a difference on the front-
STAUFFENBERG: I 'm a soldier , General . I serve my country .
OLBRICHT: It makes no sense . You opposed Hitler , you opposed the war .
STAUFFENBERG: The people chose otherwise and here we are . Now we have to win . You know what will happen if we do n't .
OLBRICHT: If we win , it will still be Hitler 's Germany .
STAUFFENBERG: We all took an oath , General .
OLBRICHT: On behalf of the Führer . Stauffenberg takes the medal and studies it .
STAUFFENBERG: I 'm a twin , you know . Olbricht is as confused as we are .
OLBRICHT: I I did n't .
STAUFFENBERG: My brother died the day after we were born .
OLBRICHT: I 'm sorry . What the hell is he talking about ?
STAUFFENBERG: I was lying in the desert , covered in blood , sure I was going to die . I tried to think about my wife , my children But my mind kept drifting to my dead brother . How I would finally be with him . How I would finally be whole again
DOCTOR: When will you be going back to the front ?
STAUFFENBERG: I 'm not going to the front . I 'm needed in Berlin .
WITZLEBEN: He is not a man , he 's a lunatic . He does n't drink , he does n't fuck . He has no weakness to exploit , no vice to manipulate . His only passion is complete control . How can you expect to reason with him ?
GOERDELER: After this most recent failure I 'd say we 've no other choice .
WITZLEBEN: Confront Hitler now and you 'll end up with piano wire for a neck-tie . Our only option is the central solution .
GOERDELER: He 's a man like any other . Flesh and blood . Take him head on and-
TRESCKOW: I 'll say this for you , Doctor You 're certainly delusional enough to take Hitler 's place .
GOERDELER: When that day comes , I 'll be sure to remember you .
TRESCKOW: I doubt you 'll remember much of anything .
GOERDELER: Dammit , Tresckow-
OLBRICHT: Gentlemen , may I present Colonel Stauffenberg . He 's been reassigned to my office at the War Ministry . Colonel , may I introduce-
STAUFFENBERG: These men need no introduction . Beck stands , shaking Stauffenberg 's hand .
BECK: I apologize for this unfortunate spectacle . On behalf of everyone , welc-
GOERDELER: I have n't welcomed him . Not yet . Where does he stand ?
TRESCKOW: For God 's sake-
GOERDELER: He 's a field officer . He knows the army better than any of us . I want to hear his opinion .
TRESCKOW: All right . What do you think , Colonel ? Confront Hitler , force him to resign ? Or the central solution ? But before Stauffenberg can answer
GOERDELER: `` Central Solution . '' You soldiers are all the same . Say what you mean .
WITZLEBEN: That 's a laugh coming from a politician .
GOERDELER: The army will follow diplomats efore they follow assassins .
TRESCKOW: They follow a butcher now . What difference does it-
STAUFFENBERG: What makes you think the army will follow you at all ?
GOERDELER: I beg your pardon , Colonel , but you are in the presence of men who would have been Hitler 's inne circle . Instead we resigned . We put our principles above personal gain .
WITZLEBEN: We have the have the respect of the people . And the army .
STAUFFENBERG: With all respect , sir , you put too much faith in your popularity . All of you do .
GOERDELER: Now see here , Colonel-
STAUFFENBERG: You said yourself , I 'm a field officer . You all may understand government , but I know the men . A great many of them may hate Hitler , ut they all fear him - they fea Himmler , Goebbels , the whole of the Reich . That kind of fear wo n't just die with Hitler . And as fo espect the army , and the people , espect only one thing . Authority . And if just one man questions that authority , you can lose them all . They were fooled into following Hitler How will you fool them - force them - into following you ?
CHILDREN: PAPA .
STAUFFENBERG: What are you doing here ? I thought I left you in Bamberg . It 's a wonderful surprise . Thank you , brother .
BERTHOLD: What do you mean you quit ?
STAUFFENBERG: I came to join the Resistance , not some sewing circle of discarded generals and politicians .
BERTHOLD: Beck is a just and capable man . As for Goerdeler , well , he 's popular . He 'll make a good Chancellor .
STAUFFENBERG: Like Hitler before him , yes ? Lately I have to wonder if Germany is even fit to choose her own destiny .
BERTHOLD: You ca n't blame the people fo this . You have to see the beginning of something to know how it 'll end . It 's no different than a farme watching the corn grow . One day it 's over his head .
STAUFFENBERG: Plenty of people thought-
BERTHOLD: The greatest offenders are not the ones who thought better but the ones who sensed better .
STAUFFENBERG: What are you trying to say ?
BERTHOLD: I seem to remember you telling me about reports from the Ukraine - the SS forcing Jews to dig thei own graves . You said then that Hitler should be removed . An officer 's duty , you said . What 's changed ?
STAUFFENBERG: I said senior officers . The only men that can get to him .
BERTHOLD: Perhaps it does n't matter that you succeed .
STAUFFENBERG: Even if they could remove Hitler , they ca n't hope to seize power . Fo God 's sake , they have no plan .
BERTHOLD: Then give them one . Find a way . He puts a hand on Stauffenberg 's arm .
STAUFFENBERG: Children , that is far too-
OLBRICHT: We 've already considered Valkyrie . It is n't suitable .
STAUFFENBERG: Not as it 's currently written .
GOERDELER: Excuse me . What is Valkyrie ?
TRESCKOW: Operation Valkyrie .
STAUFFENBERG: Hitler designed it himself to crush any internal unrest if he 's cut off or killed .
GOERDELER: And what use is that to us ?
STAUFFENBERG: The orders could be rewritten . A few subtle changes would put those eserve units completely under ou command .
OLBRICHT: Yes , of course , but-
STAUFFENBERG: Now what would the High Command do if they thought , say , the SS was staging a coup ?
OLBRICHT: They would declare a military state of emergency .
TRESCKOW: And initiate Operation Valkyrie .
STAUFFENBERG: Hitler 's own Reserve Army , using Hitler 's own plan and under ou command , would automatically seize power in Berlin
GOERDELER: While we put a new government in place .
STAUFFENBERG: Precisely . It will seem as though we 're fighting for Hitle Government , not against it .
GOERDELER: But only if Hitler 's dead . All eyes turn to Goerdeler . Here we go .
STAUFFENBERG: I 'm afraid it 's the only way .
GOERDELER: I 'm disappointed in you , Colonel . I thought a man of your background would appreciate a more-
STAUFFENBERG: I 'm a soldier first , an aristocrat second .
GOERDELER: Yes , but-
STAUFFENBERG: And you 're neither , Doctor . Now if you want to be Chancellor , you 'll do as you 're told .
BECK: Can this plan be made to work ?
TRESCKOW: Rewriting the order is one thing - distributing it is another . A bom can be disarmed , recovered if it fails . In this case we 'd be willfully circulating written evidence of high treason . It 's the best idea we 've heard yet .
OLBRICHT: There is one small problem .
TRESCKOW: Fromm
GOERDELER: Who is Fromm ?
TRESCKOW: Commander of the Home Army . Olbricht can put the reserve troops on alert , but only Fromm can actually initiate Valkyrie .
BECK: Can we get to him ?
OLBRICHT: He 's a careerist pig .
STAUFFENBERG: But one who 's gone as high as he can go in Hitler 's Army . It 's no secret he 's not happy about it .
TRESCKOW: Perhaps if we offered him a key position in the new regime he could e made to see the light .
BECK: We do n't seem to have a choice . Without Fromm there is no Valkyrie . Get him .
KEITEL: You 're a woman , Fromm . And a fat one at that . I 'd have you sent to the front if I did n't think you 'd surrender just to be Montgomery 's whore .
HERBER: The General will see you now .
FROMM: What is it you want ? Olbricht hesitates . Fromm looks up .
OLBRICHT: I wanted to introduce you to ou new man - Colonel Stauffenberg .
FROMM: Ah yes - the hero from Africa . I 'd offer my hand but you might not give it back .
STAUFFENBERG: I 'd say the General 's lost more important things this morning .
FROMM: About time they put a man with alls in this office . Have a seat . You too , if you must .
STAUFFENBERG: I am critical of losing the war , General . All wars - as in Africa - are lost through indecision .
FROMM: In the field , you mean .
STAUFFENBERG: In Berlin .
FROMM: I take it that 's why you 're here . To make decisions .
STAUFFENBERG: I 've made my decision , General . I ` m here to help others make theirs .
FROMM: They say when there 's no clea option , one should do nothing .
STAUFFENBERG: We 're at war . We must act . Sometimes rashly .
FROMM: Just what sort of rash action did you have in mind , Colonel ?
STAUFFENBERG: That would be a decision for the Supreme Military Commander .
FROMM: Supreme Commander , you say .
STAUFFENBERG: Second only to the Chancellor .
FROMM: If only I were that man This wa would be going quite differently .
OLBRICHT: We were thinking the very same thing .
FROMM: I do n't need to remind you that we 've all sworn an oath . That said , I 'm going to forget we had this conversation with the understanding that such speak will never occu under this roof again . Am I clear ?
OLBRICHT: I think that went rather well .
STAUFFENBERG: Yes Quite .
TRESCKOW: Dammit , Stauffenberg . You scared me half to death .
STAUFFENBERG: We 'll be closer than that before we 're finished .
TRESCKOW: Looking this over , I 'm not satisfied that the Reserve Army is enough to shut down Berlin completely .
STAUFFENBERG: Yes , I 've been giving that some thought . We should include any field units that are home on leave . Before Tresckow can respond , more papers
FRAULEIN OVEN: I 'll tell that I was serving the German people . Then I 'll tell them to go to hell .
TRESCKOW: To Operation Valkyrie .
STAUFFENBERG: Why did n't you tell me ?
TRESCKOW: Would you have stayed ?
STAUFFENBERG: Do you think Fromm reported us ?
TRESCKOW: It 's more likely just an unfortunate coincidence . Anyway it does n't matter . You wrote the orders . You know them better than anyone .
STAUFFENBERG: You do n't mean to say-
TRESCKOW: I 'm appointing you military leade of the Resistance . Beck agrees .
STAUFFENBERG: But Olbricht-
TRESCKOW: We both know Olbricht has n't the wit or the spine . No . It 's you .
STAUFFENBERG: That greatly limits our options of where and when to make our move , ut it 's the only way .
TRESCKOW: How will you do it ?
STAUFFENBERG: Perhaps it 's better I do n't say .
TRESCKOW: God promised Abraham that he would not destroy Sodom if he could find just ten righteous men . He puts a hand on Stauffenberg 's shoulder .
FELLGIEBEL: You realize how close I am to Hitler . With one word I could have the Gestapo make you disappear .
STAUFFENBERG: Why have n't you then ?
FELLGIEBEL: But you know . And when the SS catch you , they 'll pull you apart like warm bread . It 'll be a crime just to have known you then . I warn you . If it means protecting myself , I will expose you . Do not try to contact me again . Fellgiebel heads for the door but stops on
STAUFFENBERG: You ca n't report me . Maybe if you had when I first approached you , you 'd have been keeping your oath . But now you 're just as guilty as-
FELLGIEBEL: So you think that makes me a sympathizer , eh ? You give a man the choice of betraying a fellow officer or his Führer and assume his actions will show you his heart . It 's not that simple .
STAUFFENBERG: It is to me .
FELLGIEBEL: For the last time , do n't push me to make a decision .
STAUFFENBERG: I have no choice . It 's clear now that without you we have no hope of success . Pause . Fellgiebel 's silence speaks volumes .
FELLGIEBEL: And what if you do , eh ? What then ? Will you be any different from Hitler ? What of his Reich , his people , the very momentum of history ? Will all of that let you e something he is n't ?
STAUFFENBERG: No .
FELLGIEBEL: There it is .
STAUFFENBERG: But my pregnant wife , our fou children , the Germany I first swore to defend They demand that I be something different . They demand that I fight for their future even if it means
DRUNKEN OFFICER: Are you two finished or just getting started ?
STAUFFENBERG: Leave us , please .
OLBRICHT: You play the part of bureaucrat eautifully .
STAUFFENBERG: It 's the only time I can relax .
OLBRICHT: There 's a man here to interview as your adjutant .
STAUFFENBERG: Adjut- What for ?
OLBRICHT: No one told you ? You 've been promoted Chief of Staff for the Reserve Army .
STAUFFENBERG: For Christ 's sake . Do n't I have enough to do ?
OLBRICHT: Unfortunately , your nocturnal activities do n't count as service to the Reich .
STAUFFENBERG: I 'll refuse the promotion .
OLBRICHT: You 'll do no such thing .
STAUFFENBERG: Dammit , I ca n't handle the work I already-
OLBRICHT: This is an opportunity we could never have dreamed of . You 're in the inner circle now - with genuine access to Hitler , his advisors , his schedule We need this .
STAUFFENBERG: We 're not ready . We 're moving too fast .
OLBRICHT: Not half as fast as the Allies . An invasion is coming , Colonel . Any day now . We must act and we must act soon .
STAUFFENBERG: For what ?
OLBRICHT: We still need an assassin .
STAUFFENBERG: Be seated .
HAEFTEN: For anything , sir . Anything at all .
STAUFFENBERG: Anything is a very dangerous word .
HAEFTEN: Five thousand ships , one-hundred thousand men from the combined Allied forces . Haeften and Stauffenberg ride in a sedan . Stauffenberg is in profile the entire time .
STAUFFENBERG: What about the Panzer divisions in-
HAEFTEN: They were never dispatched . Word is Hitler took a sleeping pill . His staff was afraid to wake him .
STAUFFENBERG: First Africa , now France .
HAEFTEN: The Russians bearing down from the East .
STAUFFENBERG: Sometimes I wonder if Hitler 's real aim is to leave nothing but scorched earth for all of Europe .
HAEFTEN: Maybe this is a blessing in disguise . Maybe he 'll finally listen to reason - consider a truce while he still can .
STAUFFENBERG: We 'll see if I ca n't convince him .
HERBER: Colonel Stauffenberg is an honored guest . The hero of Africa .
FROMM: For God 's sake , Stauffenberg , you're-
HITLER: May I say , I am honored to meet a hero who has sacrificed so much fo Germany . If only more of my officers were like you .
FROMM: Mein Führer , we have asked Stauffenberg here today so that he might brief us on mobilizing troops from the Home Army to support those in Normandy .
HITLER: Hmmm ? Oh yes , Normandy . That will no longer be necessary . General Goering has assured me that Normandy is under control .
STAUFFENBERG: Mein Führer , if I may The situation in Normandy is-
KEITEL: You 're dismissed , Stauffenberg .
STAUFFENBERG: But-
KEITEL: Send your man home , Fromm . Then ing us some brandy .
STAUFFENBERG: Heil Hitler .
FROMM: I do n't know what you 've got ewing and I do n't want to know But when the music stops , I 'd be much obliged if Keitel should find himself without a chair .
STAUFFENBERG: They 're all insane . Every one of them except for Speer , and he 's nothing but an architect .
BECK: Out of the question . It wo n't work . We need you here in Berlin .
STAUFFENBERG: Who else , then ? Who can even get as close ? Beck knows there is no other choice .
BECK: Orders are not enough . They need a man to follow . The right man .
STAUFFENBERG: Olbricht will oversee operations in my absence . I can be back in Berlin three hours after Hitler is-
BECK: Three very crucial hours .
STAUFFENBERG: We both know there 's no other way . Beck nods , resigned .
BECK: I 'll tell the others-
STAUFFENBERG: Nonsense . You 're stronger than you think . You might just be the strongest one of all .
NINA: After that I thought I 'd take the children to the country for a few days to see my- Claus ? He snaps out of his thoughts . `` Hmmm ? ''
STAUFFENBERG: The country Nina . Listen . I want you to delay your trip . Just for a while .
NINA: Does this have something to do with your work ?
STAUFFENBERG: I would just be more comfortable knowing where you are - until I 'm ack from Berlin . Things will be different then . I promise .
NINA: How long until until we see you ?
STAUFFENBERG: A few days . If all goes well . Then we can travel as a family .
NINA: And if things do n't go well ? He hesitates .
STAUFFENBERG: I love you , Nina .
NINA: And I love you What-
CHILDREN: PAPA , COME AND PLAY WITH US .
NINA: Go be with your children .
MERTZ: Two 975 gram packs of plastic-W . Enough explosive to cripple a panzer . Your detonators . Your fuses . British time pencils . This acid capsule is your trigger .
OLBRICHT: What if they search your bag ?
STAUFFENBERG: I 'm one of the inner circle now . They 'll make sure I am who I am . Beyond that , they wo n't touch me . How much time do I have ?
MERTZ: Theoretically there 's a 30-minute delay . But with the kind of heat you can expect at the Wolf 's Lair , I 'd give you 10 , 15 minutes tops .
HAEFTEN: That 's hardly precise .
MERTZ: This is state of the art . You can have small or precise . Not both .
OLBRICHT: Might this be just a little too small ?
MERTZ: The explosion wo n't do the killing . The air in the room will .
OLBRICHT: Of course , I 'm all for redundancy . However If , by some miracle , Hitler does survive , what then ?
STAUFFENBERG: We have an inside man at the Wolf 's Lair in communications . He 'll notify you immediately following the flash and then sever all contact with the outside world . The others are stunned .
OLBRICHT: Just how did you manage that ?
STAUFFENBERG: It 's my job , is n't it ? While Hitler 's inner circle is still egrouping , you will initiate Valkyrie and seize control in Paris and Berlin . Even if Hitle survives , we 'll have momentum .
MERTZ: But as you said yourself it would take a miracle . Anyone in that unker when just one of these goes off is not coming out alive .
OLBRICHT: Himmler is expected to be at the meeting as well . Do n't proceed unless you can get them both .
STAUFFENBERG: That could be difficult .
OLBRICHT: Why kill a madman just to have a lunatic take his place ?
STAUFFENBERG: This is Goerdeler 's idea , is n't it ?
OLBRICHT: The members are in total agreement on this . Stauffenberg chews on this , pissed . Then
STAUFFENBERG: Fucking politicians . I 'll hold off if the decision is unanimous . And I want another man on the committee . A soldier . A soldier himself , Olbricht is insulted .
OLBRICHT: And just who this soldier be ?
STAUFFENBERG: Him .
OLBRICHT: Him ?
HELM: Lieutenant .
HAANS: What about it ?
HELM: This order is calling the Reserve Army for some sort of stand-by action in Berlin .
HAANS: Looks like a drill of some kind .
HELM: Valkyrie ? I 've never heard of that .
HAANS: Send the order through , Sergeant .
REMER: What do you suppose this is all about ?
HAGEN: Probably just a drill .
STAUFFENBERG: Drive on .
HAEFTEN: Your man ? Yes . And it is none other than GENERAL ERICH
STAUFFENBERG: Himmler . Where is Himmler ? Haeften does n't see him either . Shit .
KEITEL: Now for the first order of usiness . Fromm , I believe you will ief us on blocking divisions fo the Eastern Front
MERTZ: General Olbricht 's Office . Hold the line . Stauffenberg says Himmler 's not at the briefing . He wants to proceed . All color drains from Olbricht 's face .
OLBRICHT: Call Beck .
BECK: Beck .
STAUFFENBERG: What do you say ?
MERTZ: I say do it .
STAUFFENBERG: My briefcase .
KEITEL: Gentleman . You are dismissed .
FROMM: That call better have been important .
FREYEND: Your bag Colonel . He hands it over and leaves .
HASE: What the hell is going on ? My men have been standing here for an hour . I do n't know what to tell them .
OLBRICHT: This has been a drill . You 're all to be commended for your quick esponse . Dismissed . Pause . The men linger , confused until
SOLDIERS: HEIL HITLER .
HAGEN: What did I tell you ? A drill .
OLBRICHT: That man there . Who is he ?
HASE: Major Remer ? He commands the Deutschland Guard Battalion . What about him ?
OLBRICHT: Get rid of him .
HASE: Remer ? Do n't worry about him . He 's an order taker . To the bone . Ah yes But whose orders ?
HERBER: The General will see you now .
FROMM: How dare you put the Reserve Army on standby without my knowledge . You damn near cost me my commission . What in God 's name made you think you even had the authority ?
OLBRICHT: It was only a drill . An exercise .
FROMM: DO N'T LIE , OLBRICHT . Not to me . We oth know it was no fucking drill .
STAUFFENBERG: General , if I may-
FROMM: You may not , Colonel . You may not do anything . Because now you 've not only shown me you ca n't deliver , you 've painted a target on my back . If I so much as sense you trying to move the Reserve Army again , I 'll personally have you both arrested . Do I make myself abundantly clear ?
OLBRICHT: Heil Hitler .
FROMM: I 'll hear you say it , Colonel .
STAUFFENBERG: HEIL HITLER .
GOERDELER: The point of your central solution is to replace Hitler so that we can negotiate a truce with the Allies . The Allies , I suspect , would be more amenable to a truce IF WE
STAUFFENBERG: Today was a matter of indecision - nothing more . A military operation in the hands of a politician .
GOERDELER: I do n't think I am alone when I say your judgement is in question . I would like to take a vote .
BECK: Carl .
GOERDELER: I DEMAND THAT WE RELIEVE COLONEL STAUFFENBERG .
BECK: Carl , if I may have a word with you in private .
GOERDELER: If you have something to say , Ludwig , say it here . Say it now .
BECK: Very well . There 's no need to vote .
GOERDELER: Wha What are you saying ?
BECK: Fellgiebel informed me this evening Himmler 's issued an order for your arrest . You 'll have to leave Germany . Tonight . When we 've succeeded with the central solution you 'll return as Chancellor . Until then- Goerdeler stands , confronting Stauffenberg .
GOERDELER: This is your doing , is n't it ? IS N'T IT ? You ca n't just get rid of me like this . I am the man Germany will follow . I 'm I
BECK: Disappear , Carl . Avoid contact with anyone .
OLBRICHT: I ca n't issue Valkyrie again unless we follow through . If he fails to-
STAUFFENBERG: I 'll do my job . You just take Berlin .
BECK: Have you made your peace with God , then ?
STAUFFENBERG: As best I can .
BECK: Then you have nothing to fear . Stauffenberg manages a smile as Beck sits .
STAUFFENBERG: I know the soldier inside me is a traitor . I wonder how I 'll be judged as a man .
BECK: By history ?
STAUFFENBERG: By God .
BECK: In the end , we answer only to ourselves .
STAUFFENBERG: Bombing in Ebingen . I ca n't get through .
BECK: Ebingen is a long way from Bamberg . They 're safe . You 've seen to that . To think You came to us a wounded soldier from Africa . Now Now you are both the architect and the assassin . I 'm still trying to understand how this came to be .
STAUFFENBERG: Like a farmer watching the corn grow . One day it 's over his head
BECK: What 's that ?
STAUFFENBERG: Nothing
BECK: Gentlemen , may I introduce Chief Helldorf . He 's guaranteed the full support of the Berlin Police .
MERTZ: Put the Reserve Army on standby alert .
OLBRICHT: Not until I hear from Stauffenberg . Not until I 'm sure .
MERTZ: But that 's not what he-
OLBRICHT: Noted , Colonel . Thank you .
FREYEND: Gentlemen , may I present Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg - Chief Officer of the Reserve Army .
OFFICER #1: Colonel Stauffenberg . This is an honor . They say you 're the man that will defend Berlin from the Red Army single-hand-
STAUFFENBERG: Indeed . I 've got the whole bag of tricks right here .
FREYEND: Let me take that for you .
FELLGIEBEL: At east , Gentlemen . General Fellgiebel , communications . I just wanted to meet the hero of Africa And see if there 's anything you need .
STAUFFENBERG: Yes , sir , there is . I 'm expecting a call of the utmost importance . Even if it comes when I am in conference with the Führer I 'd appreciate it if you had a man come and get me .
FELLGIEBEL: Of course , Colonel .
KEITEL: Gentlemen . The meeting has been pushed forward to 12 30 . Mussolini is arriving on the afternoon train and Hitler wants to have lunch with him . Stauffenberg is excited by a potential bonus .
STAUFFENBERG: Will Mussolini be in the briefing ?
KEITEL: I only wish he were . Then some ambitious officer might take the opportunity to shoot the dago astard .
STAUFFENBERG: I 'll need a place to wash up - change my shirt .
FREYEND: Please , do be quick . You heard the General .
HAEFTEN: You 're arming them now ?
STAUFFENBERG: No room for error this time . Assume I have ten minutes in this heat .
HAEFTEN: Leaving just three minutes to place the bomb .
STAUFFENBERG: Plenty of time .
HAEFTEN: If the bomb goes off in ten .
FREYEND: Major Freyend speaking . Stauffenberg ? Yes , he 's arrived They are on their way now .
STAUFFENBERG: Dammit man , what is it ?
FREYEND: General Keitel insists that the Colonel please hurry .
HAEFTEN: The Colonel is changing , Major . You understand this can be difficult . Freyend backs down . A little .
STAUFFENBERG: See that the car is ready .
HAEFTEN: But sir-
STAUFFENBERG: I have everything I need , Lieutenant . Thank you .
FREYEND: Please . Let me help you with that .
STAUFFENBERG: I can manage , thank you .
FREYEND: It 's too hot . The briefing has been moved to the conference hut .
STAUFFENBERG: My injuries left me a bit hard of hearing . See that you place me as near the Führer as possible .
GENERAL: The Eastern Front forces are assured a victory but they need einforcements .
KEITEL: Please pardon our tardiness You emember Colonel Stauffenberg ?
GENERAL: As you can see , Mein Führer , the situation in the East Prussian sector is increasingly critical
ADAM: General Fellgiebel , sir . He says it 's urgent .
GENERAL: And now I believe Colonel Stauffenberg will present us with his deployment for the Replacement Army should the unthinkable occu and the Russians reach-
FREYEND: Where the hell is Stauffenberg ?
STAUFFENBERG: Contact General Olbricht in Berlin . Tell him Hitler is dead . Proceed with Operation Valkyrie . Then seve all communications . Fellgiebel nods and rushes to make the call .
COMMUNICATIONS OFFICER: What the hell just happened ?
FELLGIEBEL: What does it look like ? The Führe is-
STAUFFENBERG: We have to get to the airfield at once . Orders form the Führer .
FELLGIEBEL: Sever all communications .
COMMUNICATIONS OFFICER: Sir ?
MERTZ: I did n't hear you . Come again . Fellgiebel . FELLGIEBEL .
OLBRICHT: Well , what did he say ?
MERTZ: I could n't be sure . It sounded as though he said Hitler is still alive .
OLBRICHT: Get him back on the line .
MERTZ: Sir The bomb did go off . That much was clear . Fellgiebel 's next step will be to sever all communications . Olbricht is confused . Frozen .
OLBRICHT: Only Fromm can initiate . You know that .
MERTZ: Then lie . Tell him Hitler 's dead . Or arrest him . But do it now . But Olbricht is frozen .
OLBRICHT: I 'm not doing anything until I talk to Fellgiebel . Get him back on the phone . NOW .
KOLBE: No one gets in or out .
STAUFFENBERG: We 're on orders from the Führer . We have to get to the airfield immediately . You will step aside .
KOLBE: I 'm sorry , sir , but my orders are-
STAUFFENBERG: Get me General Keitel .
KOLBE: Kolbe .
STAUFFENBERG: Sergeant Kolbe says no one is getting out Yes . Yes . Maybe you can explain it to him .
KOLBE: That wo n't be necessary , Colonel .
OLBRICHT: I ca n't initiate Valkyrie without confirmation that Hitler 's dead . It 's too great a risk .
MERTZ: What about Stauffenberg ? What about his risk ? He did his part and now you 're abandoning him .
OLBRICHT: Watch yourself , Colonel .
MERTZ: Should n't you be consulting Beck ?
OLBRICHT: I know just what Beck will say . He 's a dying man . What does he have to lose ?
MERTZ: At least put the Reserve Army on alert .
OLBRICHT: I ca n't cover up another false alarm . When Stauffenberg returns , when he gives me confirmation . Then we 'll proceed . Mertz is speechless . As Olbricht walks out
MERTZ: And where are you going ?
OLBRICHT: The same place you are . Lunch .
ADAM: The one-eyed Colonel
KEITEL: Stauffenberg .
ADAM: He left the building very abruptly - just before the explosion .
KEITEL: Several men left the building efore the explosion .
ADAM: Yes , sir . Of course . But
KEITEL: But what ? Spit it out , man .
ADAM: Well . The Colonel left his hat .
FREYEND: Pardon the intrusion , sir , but I think you will be most interested to hear what this man has to say .
MERTZ: Orders from General Olbricht .
HELM: Send it through . But keep me informed . A SHRILL WHISTLE takes us to
HAGEN: Here we go again . He says this to
STAUFFENBERG: Quiet , is n't it ? Too quiet .
HAEFTEN: I 'll see where our driver is .
OLBRICHT: Explain this .
MERTZ: Someone had to do something while you were playing dead .
OLBRICHT: We do n't know that the Führer is not alive . We do n't know any-
STAUFFENBERG: It 's been three hours , Olbricht . What the hell have you been doing ?
OLBRICHT: We 've had no confirmation that-
STAUFFENBERG: Dammit man , I saw the explosion myself . Nothing else matters now . We are committed .
OLBRICHT: Dear God .
STAUFFENBERG: Now where is Fromm ? Is he with us or did you-
OLBRICHT: I- No one has spoken to him yet .
STAUFFENBERG: Listen to me , Olbricht . Never mind Germany . Never mind Europe . You life is at stake now , do you understand ? If you want to live through the night you 'll do exactly as I say .
OLBRICHT: I understand .
STAUFFENBERG: The second you hang up the phone , initiate Operation Valkyrie in Fromm 's name . Then go over to his office in force , give him the choice to join us or place him under immediate arrest . Do I make myself perfectly clear ?
OLBRICHT: I understand .
STAUFFENBERG: I am at the airfield now . I will be in Fromm 's office in fifteen minutes . Be there when I arrive . He slams the phone down , taking us to
OLBRICHT: Get Beck and the others . Tell them it 's time .
HELM: The Führer is dead .
HAANS: You all know your jobs . Get to work . Zombie-like , the Operators go back to thei teletypes , passing orders along .
OPERATOR: Sergeant . This order is signed by Witzleben .
HELM: That 's ridiculous . He ` s not even in the army anymore .
OLBRICHT: General Fellgiebel . At the Wolf 's Lair .
KEITEL: I do n't know what you mean . Everything 's in order here .
FROMM: There 's talk the Führer 's been assassinated .
KEITEL: Another failed attempt . The Führe was never in danger . By the way , where is your man Colonel Stauffenberg ?
FROMM: Stauffenberg ? On his way back to Berlin , I should think .
STAUFFENBERG: Hitler is dead . Operation Valkyrie is in effect . Fromm stands , pounding his fist on the desk .
FROMM: OPERATION VAL- WHO GAVE THE ORDER ?
STAUFFENBERG: You did .
FROMM: THIS IS NOTHING LESS THAN TREASON .
STAUFFENBERG: Be that as it may , the Reserve Army is assuming control here in Berlin . We trust you 'll join us .
FROMM: Dammit , man . Do you realize what you 've done ? The Führer is a-
STAUFFENBERG: I delivered the bomb myself . I saw the blast . He is dead .
FROMM: This ca n't be happening . It 's some kind of joke .
STAUFFENBERG: Are you with us or not ?
FROMM: Colonel , if what you say is true you should shoot yourself at once . The rest of you are under arrest .
STAUFFENBERG: No , General . You are .
FROMM: I do n't know where you think this is going , but I suggest you men change into civilian clothes and find a place to hide .
STAUFFENBERG: Lock him upstairs in his private quarters . Make sure his phone lines are cut .
BECK: This has to be seen as a movement of the people .
YOUNG OFFICER: Colonel Stauffenberg , sir . We 're eporting for duty .
STAUFFENBERG: Helldorf , I 'm glad to see you . We 're getting a late start and we need all of the manpower we can muster . Can we count on the police ?
HELLDORF: There 's a lot of talk that Hitle is n't really dead . Is this true ?
STAUFFENBERG: I ca n't offer you any guarantees . The decision is yours and yours alone . Can we count on you ?
HELLDORF: I 'm with you .
STAUFFENBERG: Have your men surround the uilding . No one gets in or out of here without my permission . I want every available soldier on task - we need simultaneous control of every government building in the city . Dismissed .
BECK: Acts of vengeance will not be tolerated . We represent a different form of government . We represent what is good and just in Germany .
STAUFFENBERG: Deploy troops to seize and protect all Reich agencies . Of most importance are communication centers - newspapers , radio stations , telephone and telegraph offices . All Nazi officials and government leaders are to be arrested at once
HASE: Completely blockade the government quarters . Everything from the Brandenburg Gate to Potsdamer Platz . Nobody , not even generals or ministers , should be allowed to pass . You have your orders , gentlemen .
REMER: It just all seems very vague , sir . Protocol dictates we should eceive orders in writing-
HASE: These are the orders as they were presented to me , Major . Now move .
HAGEN: Major Remer . We 've just had orders from the War Ministry . The attalion is to blockade the government quarter and place Minister Goebbels under arrest . Remer does not move . He just thinks .
REMER: Something just does n't feel right about this . I would hate to find out I 'm being taken advantage of .
HAGEN: A coup you think ?
REMER: Of that I am certain . What I ca n't say is which side we 're on . Get in . As Hagen does , Remer turns to his DRIVER .
STAUFFENBERG: Send him in . It 's all right . Send him in .
FAT GENERAL: Begging your pardon , but I have orders to report to General Fromm .
OLBRICHT: General Fromm is no longer in command . I am .
FAT GENERAL: I Beck ? What are you- What is going on here ?
STAUFFENBERG: The Führer is dead . The SS is staging a coup . We 've initiated Operation Valkyrie to crush the uprising and save Hitler 's Germany .
FAT GENERAL: I 'd say there is a coup all right , ut it 's not the SS . Olbricht offers a sheet of paper .
OLBRICHT: You will present these orders to your troops .
FAT GENERAL: I will do no such thing without speaking to General Fromm . I swore an oath-
STAUFFENBERG: You have your orders . Join us o face the consequences .
FAT GENERAL: This is treason . I wo n't take part . The Führer is not dead . THE FÜHRER
OLBRICHT: STOP THAT MAN .
STAUFFENBERG: Lt. Herber . Come here .
GOEBBELS: I am ready to be connected .
REMER: Minister Goebbels , my battalion has an order to blockade the government quarter and place you under arrest .
GOEBBELS: Are you a dedicated Nazi , Major ? Remer is caught off guard .
REMER: Yes , sir .
HAANS: What is it now , Sergeant ?
HELM: It 's just that now we 're getting conflicting orders , sir . The Wolf 's Lair says one thing , Stauffenberg another . Haans sighs , genuinely irritated now .
HAANS: Our job is not to interpret the orders . Our job is to pass them along . Regardless .
HELM: Yes , but sir-
HAANS: Is that perfectly clear , Sergeant ?
REMER: Release these men at once .
HAGEN: But these men are part of a coup .
REMER: I 've just been on the phone with Hitler himself . We are the coup , you idiot . We 've been duped .
FROMM: Well , Lieutenant . What do you make of all of this ? Herber freezes . Beat .
HERBER: I I do n't know
FROMM: I wo n't ask you to make a choice . That 's for you and you alone . All I ask is that you observe and think for yourself . In time you 'll see things for what they truly are . You know where to find me when you do .
HERBER: Heil Hitler .
GOEBBELS: Have you seen the Führer ? Is he-
HIMMLER: It seems the conference table shielded him from the blast . He 's lucky to be alive . Do you want to tell me what 's going on ?
GOEBBELS: Everything is under control . I 've taken charge of the Guard Battalion and given them new orders . We 're turning the tables on these cowards .
HIMMLER: I 've been sent here personally by the Führer to collect the conspirators . He insists they be taken alive .
GOEBBELS: Take this down . By order of Adolf Hitler
HELM: It 's a coup all right And when it 's over , we 'd better wind up on the right side . Now we ca n't afford to remain neutral any longer . We have to make a decision .
HAANS: Very well . Send all communications from the Wolf 's Lair . Stop all communications from Stauffenberg . The operators spring into action .
RADIO ANNOUNCER: The Führer himself suffered no major injuries and resumed his work immediately
STAUFFENBERG: Send the following teleprint to all Army Commanders ` Broadcast communique not correct . The Führe is dead . Orders to be carried out with utmost dispatch . '
WITZLEBEN: The military districts are eceiving contradictory reports . I 've got men sitting around joking about whose turn it is to arrest whom . Neither the capital nor the adio network are under ou control . And where are the troops ? You 'd think there would be some activity going on in this city . The word is all over the street that Hitler is still alive . We trusted you and you failed us . You should have stayed . To be sure .
STAUFFENBERG: Field Marshal Witzleben is right . I am the officer in charge . I am the man responsible . No one else . Olbricht is moved and rightly so . Meanwhile
WITZLEBEN: I 'm going home to await my inevitable arrest .
OLBRICHT: I 'm sorry , Colonel . After a beat , Olbricht turns and leaves .
HERBER: Arm yourselves .
REMER: YOU THERE .
HAEFTEN: Thank you , Colonel .
REMER: You 're under arrest .
FROMM: If you have any last messages , you 'd better write them now .
STAUFFENBERG: My actions speak for me . I 'd rather my wife and children emember our last time together .
BECK: I 'd like a pistol , please . Stauffenberg looks at Beck with surprise .
REMER: General , my orders are to delive the prisoners alive .
FROMM: Noted , Major . Get on with it then .
REMER: But , sir-
FROMM: THAT WILL BE ALL , MAJOR .
BECK: I 'm thinking of earlier times
FROMM: Very well then A court martial , convened by me in the Führer 's absence , has pronounced sentence Colonel Mertz von Quernheim , General Olbricht , Lieutenant Haeften And the Colonel , whose name I will not mention , are condemned to death . Take them outside .
STAUFFENBERG: The Führer will want to put us on trial , make an example of us . This wo n't win you any favor . And it wo n't hide you 're involvement .
FROMM: Involvement . I do n't know what you-
STAUFFENBERG: You knew and you did nothing . You 're just as guilty as we are . Even more so .
FROMM: Spare me , Stauffenberg . And those words bring a genuine smile to
STAUFFENBERG: No one will be spared .
ON BLACK: We hear a whooshing sound , getting louder .
DAVID'S VOICE: You 're a shrink . You 've got to do etter than that .
JULIANNA: Where you going so early ?
DAVID: Hey , do n't record any more messages on my alarmclock , okay ?
JULIANNA: Why not ?
DAVID: I 'll think we 're married o something .
JULIANNA: Do n't you ever say that word . O I 'll never come over here and ing you chicken soup and fuck your brains out again .
DAVID: Help yourself to whatever you want . Set the alarm , Maria will clean up . Lock up when you go . And you are the greatest .
JULIANNA: Bye `` honey ! ''
DAVID: Bye `` honey ! '' I 'll call you later .
JULIANNA: When ? When ?
DAVID: Soon !

RACHEL'S VOICE: David , please . Do n't be late fo the ten o'clock with the board .
DAVID: Okay , but . do n't tell anybody where I am I do n't care if God calls . I 'm very busy .
BRIAN: Ca n't you just get rid of that oard ?
DAVID: The Seven Dwarves ? No .
BRIAN: Those people drive you nuts .
DAVID: And that was the desire of my father , who hired them .
BRIAN: You fucked Julie Gianni again , did n't you ? David takes off driving .
DAVID: I had a cold . I was alone .

BRIAN: My dream girl Julie Gianni is your fuck buddy .
DAVID: What do you want to listen to ?
BRIAN: Slow down , man .
DAVID: What have we got here - Barcelona , Looper Radiohead ? Brian freezes at what he sees .
BRIAN: Look out ! Look out !
DAVID: We almost died .
BRIAN: I know . My own death was right there in front of me , and you know what happened ? Your life flashed efore my eyes .
DAVID: How was it ?
BRIAN: Almost worth dying for .
RACHEL: The art department needs a decision on the colors . Yellow- and- red , or white ? And the oard is pissed you 're late .
DAVID: You changed your hair .

RACHEL: They 're all waiting for you . And David - opinions are expected .
GRUMPY: How was Aspen ?
DAVID: Good . Now I want answers , and I want them now . How 's it going ?

MCCABE: You 're scared of your dreams , are n't you ?
DAVID: It 's a nightmare either way .
MCCABE: Is that how do you explain what 's happened to you ?
DAVID: What
MCCABE: What happened to your face ?
DAVID: I 'm not talking to you anymore .
MCCABE: And you do n't want to show me you face .
DAVID: No .
MCCABE: Do you know why you 're here ?
DAVID: The conversation , the coffee
MCCABE: David - the part where we parry and joust , and get to know each other bit-by-bit we 're going to have to skip it . You 've been charged with murder . In fou weeks , a judge will determine you fate based on what I write . You will talk to me
DAVID: There is no murder ! It did n't happen ! I do n't have to talk to anybody !
AARON: You want me to help -

MCCABE: I 've read it . Page 127 . `` David Junior was a delight as a child . '' Did I miss something here ? Is that all he wrote about you ?
DAVID: I do n't think he ever got over the fact that I was terrified of heights . And when he and my mother were run over by a drunken teenager on New Year 's Eve , ten years ago
MCCABE: And you believe the Board , the Seven Dwarves , put you here to take control of your company .
DAVID: What do you care ?
MCCABE: We 're just talking . And tonight 's Wednesday night , and I go to Black Angus for dinner with my daughters on Wednesday nights , so I 'll have to leave soon . You understand that our time is limited , do n't you ?
DAVID: If I talk , you 'll just think I 'm crazy . McCabe gathers his things .
MCCABE: With all the respect I can offer a man wearing a latex mask and spouting conspiracy theories , David , trust me - you 've crossed that bridge .
DAVID: Fine . Enjoy your dinner .
MCCABE: There are five basic emotions in life . Tell me . what emotion gripped him before he entered that cell ? Was it Guilt ?

DAVID: It 's okay , Tommy

JULIANNA: Sometimes I worry about one of these clever girls in a big silly coat who 'll play you in just the ight way , and I 'll lose my friend . And there 'll be no more chicken soup parties for you and me .
SOFIA: So this is what 's become of rock and roll . A smashed guitar behind a glass case displayed on some ich guy 's wall .
DAVID: It was a gift , actually .
SOFIA: I like it .
DAVID: Whoa , whoa , whoa .
SOFIA: - how did you get all this stuff , this apartment , this life -
DAVID: How about if you help me ? Unless I 'm horning in here .
SOFIA: You are , but the food 's good .
DAVID: See , I 've got a little problem . I 've got a stalker .
SOFIA: It does n't . sound life-threatening .
DAVID: I need a cover . I need for you to pretend we 're having a scintillating conversation . And you 're wildly entertained . I know it 's tough .
SOFIA: I 'll improvise -
DAVID: She 's right across the room and she 's burning a hole in my back ight now , is n't she ?
SOFIA: Red dress , strappy shoes ?
DAVID: Yes_
SOFIA: wow , she 's really staring at you .
DAVID: Shit .
SOFIA: And she seems to be growing less happy .
DAVID: Hmm .
SOFIA: I think she 's the saddest girl to ever hold a martini .
SOFIA: You have another apartment ?
DAVID: Sort of a day office . Come on -
SOFIA: I 'm not going in there .
DAVID: Well I am . Goodnight .
SOFIA: I hear her coming .
DAVID: We 're safe . And I 've got nothing to drink
SOFIA: Who did these paintings ?
DAVID: This is Joni Mitchell . This one is Monet . And this one is done by me . It is a snowboard .
SOFIA: Well , two of them are geniuses .
DAVID: It 's the real thing . His paintbrush painted that vanilla sky . His canvas . It . was my mother 's .
SOFIA: I am an actress .
DAVID: There 's probably not too much you are n't great at .
SOFIA: Are you about to compliment , my phone voice ?
DAVID: It 's pretty good , you know -
SOFIA: Oh , I 'd only disappoint , you . See - I 'm not . qualified . I can spell .
DAVID: I 'm surprised you 're available .
SOFIA: I 'm surprised you 're surprised .
DAVID: I ca n't keep this banter going .
SOFIA: Me neither .
BRIAN: I caught you .
SOFIA: Brian ! Come in here !
DAVID: What 's going on
BRIAN: Your friends are fun and I 'm drunk .

SOFIA: She looked dangerous .
BRIAN: Nobody stalks me . So I drink .
DAVID: Well , we 're out of drinks up here .
BRIAN: Here , finish my Jack and Coke .
DAVID: These stupid glasses -
BRIAN: No , it 's the stupid guy holding it .
SOFIA: Do n't worry . I 'll get . us all something . Jacks and Cokes ? She exits , leaving the two friends .
BRIAN: I better hit it . I drank too much and I did n't fucking eat .
DAVID: Do n't be stupid . The party 's just starting .
BRIAN: For you it is .
DAVID: You ca n't go . You 're my guest of honor .
BRIAN: Fuck you , David . You 're paying me to write my novel , so you own me .
DAVID: I do n't own you . You 're illiant , you 're good-looking , you 're handsome .
BRIAN: But why 'd you have to hit on Sofia ?
DAVID: No one 's hitting on Sofia .
BRIAN: Fine . Whatever you say . I 'm crazy , I 'm blind .
DAVID: No , you 're not blind . You 're just drinking Jack Daniels . And when you drink Jack , you start . in with that Frank Sinatra , `` She Shot . Me Down , '' gim me a cigarette , King of Sad thing
BRIAN: That . I do . Gim me a cigarette .
DAVID: I 'll find one .
BRIAN: But wait . You 're rich and women love you and I 'm from Ohio and I 'm drunk . Can I tell you the truth ?
DAVID: Everyone does .

SOFIA: Hang on , I 'll go with you .
BRIAN: Stay , baby .
DAVID: I 'll give you a lift home later .
SOFIA: No , I have to work tomorrow .
BRIAN: You 're in great . hands . I 'm just humoring myself that my opinion matters .
DAVID: The Sweet and Sour speech again .
SOFIA: Hey Paulo !
DAVID: I 'm glad he protects you . This is a lethal canine .
SOFIA: I love living here . And I refuse to clean up !
DAVID: No problem .
SOFIA: I 've got to work around the clock to keep this place .
DAVID: So you 're really a dancer , huh ?
SOFIA: For 14 years . But I do n't dance like you dance .
DAVID: Sure .
SOFIA: Well , it 's mine and you ca n't have it .
DAVID: I do not want to know the story ehind this photo . Who 's Sergio ?
SOFIA: It 's a nickname .
DAVID: Your nickname is Sergio ?
SOFIA: It 's a long story , and we do n't know each other .
DAVID: So many secrets .
SOFIA: That 's because I 'm really an arms dealer .
DAVID: I 've never known an arms dealer .
SOFIA: You do now . What about you ? What 's your nickname ?
DAVID: Citizen Dildo .
SOFIA: You 're not staying over .
DAVID: Never run a company . Stay an artist . Stay an arms dealer .
SOFIA: Oh please . Somehow , I ca n't play the violin for you . Although . It must be hard controlling all those people 's lives . Everyone at that party is connected to you for survival in some way , it seems .
DAVID: No . Ever accept any of you 12,000 proposals ?
SOFIA: 12,008.No .
DAVID: And you moved to New York . To dance and paint and act and deal arms .
SOFIA: Right . Do you want to hear Jeff Buckley or Vikki Carr ?
DAVID: Jeff Buckley or Vikki Carr ? Both - simultaneously .
SOFIA: Everyone said `` do n't go to New York . '' But I just think good
DAVID: No . I really do n't .
SOFIA: I have to get to sleep . Truthfully I 'm also working mornings as a dental assistant .
DAVID: Boy , am I going to the wrong dentist .
MCCABE: - actually no I do n't . I 've been married for twenty-two years .
DAVID: Ah , you 've got dinner with you daughters .
MCCABE: That 's right . I do .
DAVID: Back then I had intricate systems with women you would n't believe .
MCCABE: Like what
DAVID: Hey Doc . Do n't get all melancholy over the thirty seconds you were single a long time ago .
MCCABE: That 's what you think I 'm doing ?
DAVID: Yes .
MCCABE: Well , you may have a point . Let 's continue . Time is not ou friend .
DAVID: Just our shortcomings . That 's all we 're allowed to draw .
SOFIA: I 've never drawn such a true likeness before .
DAVID: Mine 's finished .
SOFIA: Already ? Hang on . Okay - done .
DAVID: Jesus . That 's how you see me ?
SOFIA: Maybe I did n't add enough money
DAVID: No . It 's wonderful . It 's something you 'd see on the wall of a steak-house in hell , but it 's wonderful . Sign it .
SOFIA: Let 's see yours .
DAVID: No .
SOFIA: Wow . I feel bad . You said to draw a caricature .
DAVID: I know . I could n't . I saw you like that .
SOFIA: Well , it 's very good .
DAVID: I 'll sell it to you .
SOFIA: You monster . How much for ?
DAVID: One kiss .
SOFIA: And what happens when your friend calls you tomorrow ?
DAVID: He only met you a few hours before me . He would do the same .
SOFIA: I see that friendship is important to you .
DAVID: It is . But as his best friend , I also know that he 's trying to finish a novel about inadequacy and rejection . So the longer I stay , the better it is for his career . Sofia smiles , shakes her head . And yawns .
SOFIA: Your career is one I 'd worry about . David looks down . She 's hit a nerve .
DAVID: No , no . You 're more right then you even know . I used to be one of those guys who was just
SOFIA: When did you change ?
DAVID: About five minutes ago .
SOFIA: Every passing minute is anothe chance to turn it all around .
DAVID: It 's the greatest show it 's called `` Sofia . ''
SOFIA: I 've seen this thirty times .
DAVID: We did a story on this guy . He owns half of Arizona .
SOFIA: Is he a fraud ?
DAVID: How would you ever know ?
SOFIA: Good point .
DAVID: I left my number on your fridge .
SOFIA: Come here , I want to tell you a secret .
DAVID: Thank you for the inspiration . I will now attempt to run my company , showing compassion fo the seething throng of my partners who root quietly for me to fail .
SOFIA: Pleasure delayer .
JULIANNA: David Aames .
DAVID: Julie Gianni . You 're following me .
JULIANNA: only a little . I wanted to finish what we were talking about .
DAVID: And _-
JUL IANNA: How 'd it work out with our Moth Girl ? Did she turn into a utterfly for you ?
DAVID: Yes she did .
JULIANNA: But I can see from your walk that you did n't sleep with her . David turns .
DAVID: You 're right on the money , Julie .
JULIANNA: She must be exhausted from trying to be witty for you all night long .
DAVID: Hey , Julie .
JUL IANNA: Sorry . You 're just never there for your friends until they 've already given up on you .
DAVID: I 'm not blowing you off ! I just want to be alone for a little bit . Trust me - I have a lot of things I got ta take care of . If we 're friends , which we are , you 'll understand .
JULIANNA: I 'm sorry I got weird . I missed an audition and I just felt bad
DAVID: Sure I would -
JULIANNA: Do you like my music ?
DAVID: It 's vivid .
JULIANNA: If I were n't me , I would buy a CD y me .
DAVID: Well , you know , if you can reach one person . Julianna is a little hurt , hides it well .
JULIANNA: What is happiness to you , David ?
DAVID: what is happiness ?
JULIANNA: For me , this is happiness . Being with you .
JU.LIANNA: One thing bothers me . Why did you tell Brian I was your fuck-buddy ?
DAVID: I did n't tell him that . I did n't say that .
JULIANNA: When did you stop caring ?
DAVID: About what
JULIANNA: About the consequences of the promises you made .
DAVID: Promises - I thought we had an understanding .
JULIANNA: Do you know how hard it is to pretend to be your `` buddy ? '' I love you , David . You fucked me four times in one night . You have een inside me and I have swallowed your come . That means something .
DAVID: Julie
JULIANNA: Four times , David ! That means something . Four times .
DAVID: stop the car !
JULIANNA: Twenty-four hours a day I live with the aching possibility that you might call me to do something .
DAVID: Take me to your house . We 'll talk this out . I want to see where you live . I want you to stop the car , Julie . I want you to stop the car !
JULIANNA: Do n't you know , David ? Every time you sleep with someone you ody makes a promise whether you do or not ?
SOFIA: Hello .
DAVID: You 're amazing . Hello .
SOFIA: Did you get to work alright ?
DAVID: Yeah , well , actually I had a horrible dream .
SOFIA: You dreamed you 'd never see me again .
DAVID: I left your house . I went to the car , and my friend the stalker had een following me .
SOFIA: Julie .
DAVID: Yes . She followed me down the street . She wanted to talk , and I had that buzz from you and me , and I think my mind was on that terrible drawing of me and , you know , I got inside . And she drove me off a bridge and committed suicide with me in the car .
SOFIA: I thought you were going straight to work .
DAVID: But I survive ! I survive with my arm and my face reconstructed . And what 's worse I could n't wake up .
SOFIA: How was your house after the party ?
DAVID: What party ? A party ?
SOFIA: The PARTY . Remember ? Red dress strappy shoes I spilled something on your SHIRT sweet and sour and the saddest girl to ever hold a martini . He looks at her , completely lost and spacy .
DAVID: I do n't I do n't remember .
MCCABE: Do you dream about the ca accident ?
DAVID: And then I came back to life . Just like that dog , Benny . Benny The Dog .
MCCABE: Benny . Benny The Dog .
DAVID: Except my life was no longe normal . There were blinding migranes now
MCCABE: I 'm from Ohio - we do n't have power upheavals .
DAVID: And they 're in the news every day , ight . between the lines . Someone did this to me . My father wrote this in his book , you know . Chapter One , Page One , Paragraph One . What is the answer to 99 out of a hundred questions ? Money .
TIPP: David David David . I do n't want to worry you , I 'm holding them off . But we 've got a situation here . The by-laws of the Board protect your 51 % vote only if you 're mentally acute . Now I 'm sorry that poor girl died , but you 've given the Board a real gift with your mishap . They 'd like to declare you `` incapacitated . '' But you are back , and you sound good to me -• so let 's fight the fuckers._ . and have a full ecovery . And maybe you should let people see you . I mean , the last time we were together you were in a coma and you were very fucking rude to me . You did n't say a word .
DAVID: Yes , well , the rumors of my death have been mildly exaggerated .
DR. POMERANZ: The cranial structure was based on thirty pins fastened by small panels and bits of bone from the mandible and it seems the cartilage grafts have maintained your cheek structure . Unfortunately , because you were in a coma , immediate plastic surgery was impossible .
DAVID: Is that the procedure for all Bilateral Periorbital Hematomas in a LeFort III fracture of a comatose patient ?
DR. POMERANZ: In a LeFort III - absolutely . The potential for sub-cranial brain damage was too great .
DAVID: And beyond the cheek grafts , Dr. Pomeranz is , are the pins fastened
DR. POMERANZ: Yes , we are working on processes . But it you 're specifically not at the stage where we can experiment
DAVID: Experiment . Use me .
DR. POMERANZ: The headaches will go away -
DAVID: These are more than headaches . This is like a steel plate slicing through my every thought .
DR. POMERANZ: We 're not cowboys . We ca n't , just wing it .
DAVID: Because I ca n't think straight most of the time .
DR. POMERANZ: We can increase your medication .
DAVID: Yes . Medication .
DR. POMERANZ: And there are things we 'll continue to investigate . But there are so many others who 've not been able to benefit aesthetically from plastic surgery as you have
DAVID: This is n't about vanity , Dr. Pomeranz ! This is n't about vanity . This is about functioning in the world .
OTHER DOCTOR: We could do something about you arm
DAVID: Fuck my arm ! Dr. Pomeranz looks over to a young assistant .
DR. POMERANZ: Nobody here takes your feelings for granted . We did prepare something for you , based on the preliminary examination .
DAVID: Tell me . Bring it on .
DR. POMERANZ: It 's sometimes useful in the early stages of rejection . It 's a facial prosthetic . It was two weeks in the making .
DAVID: A facial prosthetic .
DR. POMERANZ: The aesthetic replacement does work . Emotionally , and actually .
OTHER DOCTOR: And the plastic in the aesthetic shield also filters out abusive ays , and assists in the egeneration of cells .
DAVID: So it 's an aesthetic regenerative shield .
DR. POMERANZ: That 's correct . Exactly .
THIRD DOCTOR: And the ergonomics of the plate- arrier allows it to reflexively interact with the movements of your own face .
DAVID: I see
DR. POMERANZ: It 's a helpful unit .
DAVID: Good . Because for a minute there I thought we were talking about a fucking mask !
DR. POMERANZ: It 's only a mask if you treat it that way .
DAVID: No it 's great . This completely takes care of Halloween . But what about the other 364 days of the year ?
DAVID: Sofia . Sofia . Sofia . Sofia . Sofia . Sofia .
SOFIA: It 's been a long time . I tried to see you but your people would n't let me .
DAVID: I did n't want to see me , okay . But then I woke up today and finally , a good hair day . David fights anxiety , smoothes his coat .
SOFIA: Sure .
DAVID: What ?
SOFIA: Let 's go out and do something .
DAVID: This weekend . I 'll cancel an operation or two . We 'll have fun . Because I am all about fun .
CONAN: He is thawed out , right ?
DAVID: Hey listen , it 's David . I 'm back in your life . I saw you earlie tonight . I was just watching ou old friend Benny the Dog on on Conan and I thought of you . Whatever . I loved seeing you today . So I 'll see you soon . You 're a great dancer !
SOFIA: Hi !
BRIAN: Hey .
DAVID: What are you drinking ?
SOFIA: Nothing .
BRIAN: I am in the mood for cheap sugary overpriced rum-and-cokes . You want one ?
DAVID: Is there any other kind ?
BRIAN: I 'll go get us some -
SOFIA: Where 's the bathroom ?
BRIAN: Behind over by the place next to the door by the chick I mean , girl who looks like Bjork . She leaves . David turns to Brian immediately .
DAVID: You look good , man . How 's you ook ?
BRIAN: Take it off .
DAVID: I ca n't . It 's a facial shield . It 's an antiseptic prosthesis to stop infections . These fucking doctors .
BRIAN: Take off the mask ! It 's freaking me out .
DAVID: I ca n't . It 's my face . This is my face .
BRIAN: Oh no . Trust me . It 's a little different .
DAVID: Hey , if you 're embarrassed , just go . Nobody asked you to chaperone
BRIAN: Sofia asked me .
DAVID: She did n't want to be alone with me ? That 's bullshit . Because I think I 'm being pretty fucking cool about the whole thing .
BRIAN: Talk to a shrink ! Or you can call me sometime , instead of hiding in your apartment . Do n't take it out on a girl you only met once .
DAVID: Did she say that ? I met he `` once ? '' Did she say I met he `` once ? '' Brian looks away . He 's said too much .
BRIAN: Cut it out . I miss the old you . We all miss the old you . Because the new guy is shit .
DAVID: Fuck you , Brian . How about no more sympathy ? How about if that 's the deal we make with each other ? Okay ?
BARMAN: What kind of tequila ?
DAVID: What did you say to me ?
BARMAN: I said - What . Kind . Of . Tequila .
DAVID: Why do n't you ask me to my face , itch ? The barman looks up , expressionless .
BARMAN: No . This is on the house .
DAVID: Why -
BARMAN: It just is . Bitch .
DAVID: Patron !
SOFIA: Hello again .
DAVID: Idea . Let 's start all over .
SOFIA: I do n't talk like that .
DAVID: She 's right across the room and she 's burning a hole in my back ight now , is n't she ?
SOFIA: Red dress , strappy shoes ?
DAVID: That 's right !
SOFIA: David
DAVID: Are you okay ?
SOFIA: No .
DAVID: What 's wrong ? Is it me ?
SOFIA: I 'll tell you later .
DAVID: Come on . Tell me now . Something 's wrong . Tell me everything . Let 's talk about it ight now .
SOFIA: I 'll tell you in another life when we are both cats .
DAVID: I do n't believe you just said that . That . is the best thing I 've ever heard . That is hilarious . God , that just killed me . The way you said that . See - that 's what I love about you . `` I 'll tell you in another life when we are both cats . ''
SOFIA: Well , this is where I leave you .
BRIAN: Wait . I 'll walk you to your door .
SOFIA: No , I live just around the corner .
BRIAN: I 've got my bike here .
SOFIA: I 'd rather walk .
DAVID: Do n't be a drag . Ca n't you see she wants to go on her own ?
BRIAN: Shut up , you 're drunk .
DAVID: I may be an idiot , but I 'm not drunk .
SOFIA: Seriously , I do n't need you to walk me home . Thank you .
BRIAN: Okay then . So . We 'll call you .
SOFIA: Great . We 'll go catch a movie o something .
DAVID: We 'll meet up soon . Sofia turns and runs away .
BRIAN: We 'll call you .
DAVID: Where you going ?
BRIAN: My bike . It 's back over there . We 'll hang soon . Bring your mask if you want . I 'm getting used to it .
DAVID: Wait a minute .
BRIAN: What ?
DAVID: I do n't know .
BRIAN: You drank a little too much . Call me tomorrow if you want .
DAVID: Tomorrow I 'll wish I was dead .
BRIAN: No you wo n't . You just need to sleep .
DAVID: Hey !
BRIAN: What !
DAVID: What did you say to Julie Gianni the night of the accident ?
BRIAN: What ?
DAVID: You told her she was a `` fuck uddy . ''
BRIAN: Never .
DAVID: And she was a little more than pissed about it .
BRIAN: Have you been harboring this shit all along ? I never talked to her .
DAVID: Whatever . I mean - who am I , if I ca n't . be the one who tells you you 're not ugly ? Aw , give me a courtesy laugh . Come on ! Brian shakes his head , starts running .
WOMAN'S VOICE: Open your eyes open you eyes
JULIANNA: Boo !
DAVID: No , I 'm okay -
DAVID POV: Sofia examines him with a look of concern and
SOFIA: And it worked . Get up .
DAVID: Ugh -
SOFIA: That 's right . I agree . Ugh .
DAVID: This is a joke .
SOFIA: David . I 'm not going to lie to you . I liked the way you looked . But if you do n't pull it together , I 'll forget the other guy . You know that . other guy - YOU ?
DAVID: I 'm still that guy . I 'm still that guy .
SOFIA: I do n't . have a mother-savior bone in my body . It 's not about that . You 're coming inside . But if this
DAVID: I am still that guy .
SOFIA: Shut up .
DAVID: Where 's Brian ?
SOFIA: He went with you , did n't he ?
DAVID: I thought you guys hooked up .
SOFIA: I wish you had n't gotten in the car with that girl .
DAVID: Sofia I 'm
SOFIA: Your eyes apologized better . Come on .
MCCABE: I see you have n't been wasting your time . Do you ever draw anything else ?
DAVID: No .
MCCABE: Did you sleep last night . ?
DAVID: No . I did not sleep .
MCCABE: I 've got to leave early today , so you 'll have to be brief . Now . What can you tell me about the name `` Ellie ? ''
DAVID: Ellie ?
MCCABE: Is that a girl you knew ? A girl you were in love with ?
DAVID: I 've only been in love once .
MCCABE: Apparently , you kept repeating it last night . You did sleep , David , and your advisor said you cried out , you had a nightmare .
DAVID: Everything is a nightmare
MCCABE: You cried out for `` Ellie , '' David . Do you remember what happened ?
DAVID: No no
MCCABE: Dig deep , David . Dig deep . You cried out for Ellie . What do you emember about Ellie ? Show me your face , David . Help me . Open the door . David rises and goes to the prison window . ANGLE ON McCABE
DAVID: I never trusted the Doctors . What happened next was surreal . That same arrogant bastard , Dr .
DR. POMERANZ: David ! Hey , my brother . I felt . eally bad about our last conversation .
DAVID: He 'd discovered a new form of econstructive surgery , with the help of a doctor from Berlin .
DAVID SINGING: what if Gawd was one of ussssss ``
MCCABE: Suspicious of whom ? Of what ?
DAVID: Once you 've been driven off a idge at 80 miles an hour , somehow you do n't invite happiness in without a full body search .
MCCABE: Well , at the risk of boring you , I can present the alternate argument . I once knew a guy who was a real loner . And one day he woke up at 40 , with two daughters who lit his life up with purpose . Suddenly he goes to endless school
DAVID: I always liked George .
MCCABE: It all depends on the individual , does n't it ? Tell me . What 's happiness for you ?
JULIANNA: What 's happiness to you , David ?
DAVID: How about another question -
MCCABE: Well , you wo n't show me your face . So back to the time-line . Hurry . Let 's move through this .
SOFIA: You 've got to take the plates off , David .
DAVID: I do n't want to know what 's unde here .
SOFIA: It 's going to be fine , you 'll see .
DAVID: I already called Pomeranz and switched it to Wednesday .
SOFIA: I hope that shrew at the front desk gave you shit about it .
DAVID: I 'll go in the morning . The car 'll be fixed .
SOFIA: Good , because I know that the problem would n't be you delaying something you were dreading .
DAVID: Could n't be that .
SOFIA: Nooooo , it could n't be that . She pulls off one of the plates .
DAVID: How bad is it ?
SOFIA: Well , your ears are in the right place . And the rest of it is not too bad at all . Tenderly she kisses , and hugs him .
DAVID: In my next life I want to come ack as this mole -
SOFIA: I love you . I love you . I love you .
DAVID: - I could live right there .
SOFIA: Is this a dream ?
DAVID: Oh absolutely .
BRIAN: What , did she say ?
DAVID: I have no idea . Brian shakes his head .
BRIAN: Fine .
DAVID: How 's things , Brian ?
BRIAN: Do n't flatter yourself . I 'm fine . Besides - Sofia is great , but by no means one-ofa-kind . She was a proximity infatuation .
DAVID: Where 'd you get the camera ?
BRIAN: I 'm into things you have no idea .
DAVID: Well , as long as you 're okay .
BRIAN: And anyway , we 're friends , are n't we ?
DAVID: Always . David offers his hand . They shake .
BRIAN: Hey what 's up with your face ? Fuck , there 's a seam opening o something !
DAVID: What - what are you talking about ?
SOFIA: Was I snoring ?
DAVID: No , I think it was me . Thirsty , that 's all . She kisses his hand reassuringly .
SOFIA: I 'm dreaming about you . Mmmmmmm . He gets up and goes to the bathroom .
DAVID: I could listen to you say `` mmmmm '' for the rest of my life .
JULIANNA: Baby , what 's wrong ?
DAVID: Where . Is . She .
JULIANNA: Who ?
DAVID: Now I 'm going to make sure that I tie this four times . Do you know why , Julie ? Because four times eally means something .
JULIANNA: David , do n't hurt me .
DAVID: Okay , I 'm freaked out . It worked . So just tell me right now - where is Sofia ?
JULIANNA: I am Sofia .
DAVID: In one minute I 'm going to call the police
JULIANNA: Do n't do it , honey .
DAVID: I knew you 'd survived the accident . She looks at him with tearful eyes .
JULIANNA: What . accident ?
DAVID: Whose body was it ? Who 's the one who hired you ? The Seven Dwarves ?
JULIANNA: I have n't had any accident !
DAVID: No , of course not . It was n't an accident at all . It was attempted murder !
JULIANNA: Honey , please . He picks up the phone . Dials 911 .
DAVID: Police Department ? I 've captured an intruder who 's entered my home . He turns to her . Her eyes are yearning .
TIPP: Guys , can you give us a minute here ? Detective Larson Detective Andrews thank you . The room empties , and Tipp approaches David .
DAVID: They think that I had something to so with this .
TIPP: I 'm going to handle this exactly the way your father would have handled this . I 've got it solved .
DAVID: You 've got it solved ? Where is she ?
TIPP: She 's going to be fine . David hugs Tipp .
DAVID: Thank God you 're here , man . I love her .
TIPP: Yeah Now , I want you to look at these photos and then I 'm going to destroy them . Sofia 's testimony is also in here . It wo n't exist . She 's not going to press charges .
DAVID: Press charges against . me ?
TIPP: David , wake up . As your friend , I think you should see what you did to Sofia . The press wo n't get hold of this if you get . away quickly .
DAVID: This is Julie Gianni . That 's not Sofia . This is Julie Gianni . I did n't do that do that to her . Tommy , someone 's setting me up .
TIPP: David , the Board and I have taken care of everything . They 've been eally great , actually . All of this is going to disappear . We 're all behind you even the Board .

DAVID: Look . I 'm straight , okay ?

MCCABE: No .
LIBBY: Welcome to Life Extension . Have a look at our proposal . Please follow me .
MCCABE: You can wait out here .
LIBBY: You 'll be meeting Rebecca Dearborn . My personal role model .
PATIENT #1: .and I 'm not a `` true believer '' y nature . But the older you get , the more you see the flow of the future , and I made a choice
PATIENT #2: .why not embrace the future ? I Believe the research - the future is in the union of the spiritual and the scientific
MCCABE: `` Cryonization - a journey of re- awakening after the preservation of the human body at extremely low temperatures . ''
DAVID: They laughed at Jules Verne too .
MCCABE: David , you 're not-
DEARBORN: Mr. McCabe , how are you ? I 'm Rebecca Dearborn . Life Extension , or L.E . as we like to refer to it , is a glimpse of the future a ticket not in the juvenile sense , but in the deeply meaningful sense that can only be borne in the human heart .
MCCABE: Did you sign this contract , David ? David looks down at pamphlet , looks up .
DAVID: What 's the `` Lucid Dream '' option ?
DEARBORN: Good choice . The Lucid Dream is Life Extension 's newest option . For a little extra , we offer the cryonic union of science and entertainment .
MCCABE: `` Cryo-tainment. ``
DEARBORN: Some find this presentation helpful .
NARRATION: Portrait of a modern human life . American , male . Birth . and Death . Imagine that you are suffering from a terminal illness . You 'd like to be cryonized , but you 'd rather be esurrected to continue your own life , as you know it now . L.E . offers you the answer . Upon esurrection you will continue in an ageless state - preserved - but living in the `` present '' with a future of your choosing .
DEARBORN: A living dream .
MCCABE: Your death will be wiped from you memory . I guess I missed that one in USA Today .
DAVID: . a dream What if there was a mistake ? What if the dream became a nightmare ?
DEARBORN: Of course , your subconscious can always play tricks on you . The subconscious is a very powerful thing -
MCCABE: Did you sign a contract with these people , David ?
DEARBORN: -but this is a serious business . The Lucid Dream is worth the risk .
DAVID: I want to wake up ! I want to wake up ! Aaron grabs for him . David wrenches free .
VENTURA: David Aames . I think it 's time we had a proper re-introduction . I 'm Edmund Ventura from the oasis Project , formerly Life Extension •
DAVID: Tech support .
VENTURA: Yes , I 'm your Tech Support . We first met 150 years ago .
DAVID: Oh shit . You sold me the Lucid Dream . Ventura smiles .
VENTURA: I tried to warn you in the bar . I told you to exercise control , that it all depended on your mind . All of this , everything is you creation . And we 're now heading toward your true moment , of choice .
DAVID: `` True moment of choice ? ''
VENTURA: Yes .
DAVID: When did the Lucid Dream begin ?
VENTURA: Remember the day of the nightclub ?
DAVID: Yes .
VENTURA: That night , when Sofia left you and you fell asleep on the pavement , that was the moment you chose for the splice
DAVID: The splice ?
VENTURA: Splice . The end of your `` real '' life and the beginning of L.E . 's Lucid Dream . A splice of many years which passed while you were frozen and dreaming .
SOFIA: Open your eyes .
VENTURA: From the moment you woke up on that street , nothing was `` real '' in
DAVID: I 'm not a big fan of heights .
VENTURA: I know . We erased what really happened from your memory .
DAVID: ..erased ?
VENTURA: Replaced by a better life unde these beautiful Monet-like skies .
DAVID: My mother 's favorite .
VENTURA: That 's right.. A better life ecause you had Sofia .
DAVID: An album cover ?
VENTURA: a movie you once saw late at night that showed you what a father could be like
DAVID: What happened in my real life ? Something happened . What did you erase ?
VENTURA: Do you really want to know ?
DAVID: Tell me everything .
VENTURA: The morning after the nightclub , you woke up on that street , hung- over and along . You got up and walked away . You never saw Sofia again .
DAVID: I did n't kill Sofia .
VENTURA: No .
DAVID: Tommy . But then somebody died .
VENTURA: You longed for Sofia . You shut yourself away for months . You were alone . You could n't take the pain anymore . Headaches you could barely function .
DAVID: I found you on the Internet . I signed the contract with you . And then
VENTURA: And on a day in late December , you gave yourself to us . You 're now in a suspended state .
DAVID: The little things . There 's nothing bigger , is there ?
VENTURA: Your subconscious did create problems . Your dream turned into a nightmare . The glitch has been corrected .
DAVID: So all I have to do is imagine something ? If I wanted McCabe to come back , right now - McCabe comes flying out of the door .
MCCABE: David . Listen to me . These people are dangerous . We 're in trouble . We need to get off this oof now .
MCC DAVID: Who turns from McCabe to Ventura . Ventura leads David away .
VENTURA: We 're now on `` pause '' . And you 're about to return to your Lucid Dream
MCCABE: `` Pause '' ?
VENTURA: .. with all of the upgrades . You wo n't remember any of this , nor be charged for the technical support . it is now your moment of choice . You can return to your Lucid Dream , and live a beautiful life
DAVID: The world out . there . And you can ing me back , just . like Benny the Dog .
VENTURA: Yes . Just like Benny the Dog . Your face and body can now be fixed , of course . But it 's very different out there now . You finances wo n't last long . You panel of observers are waiting fo you to choose .
DAVID: How do I wake up ?
VENTURA: The decision is yours . Ventura glances over the edge .
DAVID: And I chose this scenario , did n't
VENTURA: Yes , to face your last remaining fear of heights .
MCCABE: David , do n't listen to him . You were right . This is the Seven Dwarves . It 's a set up ! You ca n't trust him . David looks at McCabe with compassion .
VENTURA: Do n't feel bad , David . This winning man is your creation . It 's in his nature to fight fo his existence . But he 's not real .
MCCABE: I 'm real . I have two daughters . You know that .
VENTURA: What are their names ?
VENTURA: It 's been a brilliant journey of self-awakening , and you 've simply got to ask yourself what is happiness to you ?
DAVID: I want to live a real life . I do n't want to dream any longer .
VENTURA: Any last wishes ?
DAVID: Let them out there read my mind .
VENTURA: I wish you well , David .
DAVID: Look at us . I 'm frozen , and you 're dead . And I love you .
SOFIA: It 's a problem .
DAVID: I lost you when I got in that car . I 'm sorry .
SOFIA: I 'll find you again .
DAVID: I 'll see you in another life when we are both cats .

NURSE: You ca n't be in here .
GALVIN: I 'm her attorney .
BISHOP: It 's a question of continuing values . St. Catherine 's to do the good that she must do in the community has to maintain the position that she holds in the community . So we have a question of balance . On the one hand , the reputation , and , so , the effectiveness of our hospital , and two of her important doctors and , on the other hand , the rights of your client .
BISHOP: A young woman . In her prime deprived of life sight her family It 's tragic . It 's a tragic accident . Galvin has been dreaming .
BISHOP: Yes . We must try to make it right .
GALVIN: How did you settle on the amount ?
BISHOP: We thought it was just .
GALVIN: You thought it was just .
BISHOP: Yes .
GALVIN: Because it struck me how neatly 'three ' went into the amount . Two Hundred Ten Thousand . That would mean I keep seventy .
BISHOP: That was our insurance company 's ecommendation .
GALVIN: Yes . It would be . A beat .
BISHOP: Nothing that we can do can make that woman well .
GALVIN: And no one will know the truth .
BISHOP: What is the truth ?
GALVIN: That that poor girl put her trust in the hands of two men who took he life , she 's in a coma , her life is gone . She has no family , she has no home , she 's tied to a machine , she has no friends and the people who should care for her her Doctors , and you , and me , have been bought off to look the other way . We have een paid to look the other way . I came in here to take your money . I brought snapshots to show you . So I could get your money . I ca n't take it . If I take it . If I take that money I 'm lost . I 'm just going to be a rich ambulance chaser . I ca n't do it . I ca n't take it .

I have to go in there tomorrow to find twelve people to hear this case . I 'm going to see a hundred people and pick twelve . And every one of them it 's written on their face , 'This is a sham .

JUDGE: I believe that 's the law is it not , Mr. Galvin ? A beat .
GALVIN: Dr. Thompson . From your review of the hospital records of May twelfth nineteen seventy-six .
DR. THOMPSON: Cardiac arrest . During delivery he heart stopped . When the heart stops the brain 's deprived of oxygen . You get brain damage . That is why she 's in the state she 's in today .
GALVIN: Now , Dr. Towler 's testified that they restored the heartbeat within three or four minutes . In your opinion is his estimate correct ?
DR. THOMPSON: It 's my opinion it took him much longer . Nine ten minutes . There 's too much brain damage . The Judge leans over .
JUDGE: Are you saying that a failure to estore the heartbeat within nine minutes in itself constitutes bad medical practice ?
DR. THOMPSON: Well
GALVIN: Your Honor !
JUDGE: Yes , Mr. Galvin ?
GALVIN: If I may be permitted to question my own witness in my own way
JUDGE: I 'd just like to get to the point , Mr. Galvin . Let 's not waste these people 's time . Answer the question , Mr . Witness . Please . Would a nine minute lapse in restoring the heartbeat in and of itself be negligence ?
DR. THOMPSON: I in that small context I would have I would have to say 'no . '
JUDGE: Then you 're saying there 's no negligence , based on my question ?
DR. THOMPSON: I given the limits of you question , that 's correct .
JUDGE: The Doctors were not negligent .
DR. THOMPSON: I um
JUDGE: Thank you .
GALVIN: I 'm not through with the witness , your Honor . With all due respect if you are going to try my case for me I would appreciate it if you would n't lose it . The Judge stands , furious .
JUDGE: Thank you . I think that 's enough fo this morning . I 'll see the Plaintiff 's Counsel in my chambers . Now , please .
GALVIN: I 'm an attorney on trial before the ar . Representing my client . My client , do you understand ? You open your mouth and you 're losing my case for me .
JUDGE: Listen to me , fella

TOWLER: we were trying to restore he heartbeat .
GALVIN: What happened in those three minutes ?
TOWLER: We 'd gone to 'Code Blue , ' we were administering electro
GALVIN: Why did it take that long to get he heartbeat
CONCANNON: Your Honor ! Your Honor
TOWLER: Brain damage could have been it did n't necessarily take nine minutes , it could have been caused in two
GALVIN: Wait , wait , wait , you 're saying that her brain damage could have been caused by her being deprived of oxygen for two minutes ?
TOWLER: Yes .
GALVIN: Huh . And why is that ?
TOWLER: Because she was anemic . It 's right there on her chart . He ain was getting less oxygen anyway

Mr. White asked me , 'How did you do . ' I said , ' I 've done my best . ' He said , 'They do n't pay you to do your best . They pay you to win . ' That 's what pays for this office . And that 's what pays for the pro ono work that we do for the poor . And for the kind of law that you want to practice . And that 's what pays for your clothes and my whiskey , and the leisure that we have to sit ack and discuss philosophy . As we 're doing tonight . We 're paid to win the case .

GALVIN: Dr. Towler ; page 406 , 'Contraindications to general anesthetic . Ideally a patient should efrain from taking nourishment up to nine hours prior to induction of general anesthetic . ' Does that sound familiar ?
DR. TOWLER: Yes . I wrote it . Galvin shows the book .
GALVIN: 'Practice and Methodology in Anaesthesia . ' General textbook on the subject . Is that correct ?
DR. TOWLER: I . Yes . It is .
GALVIN: And you wrote that
DR. TOWLER: Yes .
GALVIN: Page 414 , 'If a patient has taken nourishment within one hour prior to inducement , general anesthetic should e avoided at all costs because of the grave risk the patient will aspirate food particles into his mask . ' Is that what happened to Deborah Ann Kaye ? She aspirated into her mask ?
DR. TOWLER: She threw up in her mask , yes . But she had n't eaten one hour prior to admission .
GALVIN: If she had eaten , say one hour prio to admission , the inducement of a general anesthetic the type you gave her would have been negligent ?
DR. TOWLER: Negligent . Yes it would have been criminal . But that was not the case .
GALVIN: Thank you .
JUDGE: Mr. Concannon ?
CONCANNON: Nothing further , your Honor .
JUDGE: Mr. Galvin , rebuttal ?
GALVIN: Katherine Price . The Bailiff calls out her name .
BAILIFF: Katherine Price
BAILIFF: D'you swear that the evidence you are about to give will be the truth , the
BAILIFF: whole truth and nothing but the truth , so help you God ?
KATHY: I do .
BAILIFF: Be seated .
GALVIN: Kathy Price
KATHY: Yes
GALVIN: You were the Admitting Nurse at St. Catherine Laboure Hospital on May twelfth , nineteen seventy-six , the night Deborah Ann Kaye was admitted
KATHY: Yes . Galvin holds up a form .
GALVIN: You signed this form ? She looks closely at it . Is satisfied .
KATHY: Yes .
GALVIN: These are your initials , ' K.C . ' ?
KATHY: Kathy Costello . That 's my maiden name . A beat .
GALVIN: D'you ask the patient when did she last eat ?
KATHY: Yes .
GALVIN: What did she say ?
KATHY: She said she had a full meal one hour before coming to the hospital .
GALVIN: One hour .
KATHY: Yes .
GALVIN: And did you write the numeral 'one ' down on the record , standing for one hour ?
KATHY: I did .
GALVIN: A single hour .
KATHY: Yes .
GALVIN: Your witness .
CONCANNON: You are aware of the penalties fo perjury ?
KATHY: It 's a crime .
CONCANNON: Yes . It is a crime . A serious crime .
KATHY: I would n't do it .
CONCANNON: You would not ?
KATHY: No .
CONCANNON: In fact , you 've just taken an oath that you would not commit perjury . You 've just sworn to that . Is n't that right ?
KATHY: Yes .
CONCANNON: Just now
KATHY: Yes .
CONCANNON: sworn before God you would tell the truth ?
KATHY: Yes .
CONCANNON: Now . I 'd like to ask you something four years ago , when you were working as a nurse , are you aware that Drs . Towler and Marx based their treatment of Deborah Ann Kaye on this chart that you signed ?
CONCANNON: And was n't that an oath ? These are your initials here K.C . When you signed this chart you took an oath . No less important than that which you took today . Is n't that right ? Is n't that right ?
KATHY: I yes .
CONCANNON: Then , please , which is correct ? You 've sworn today the patient ate one hou ago . Four years ago you swore she ate nine hours ago ? Which is the lie . When were you lying ?
CONCANNON: You know these doctors could have settled out of court . They wanted a trial . They wanted to clear thei names .
GALVIN: Objection !
CONCANNON: And you would come here , and on a slip of memory four years ago , you 'd uin their lives .
KATHY: They lied .
CONCANNON: 'They lied . ' Indeed ! When did they lie ? And do you know what a lie is ?
KATHY: I do . Yes .
CONCANNON: You swore on this form that the patient ate nine hours ago .
KATHY: That 's not my handwriting .
CONCANNON: You 've just said you signed it .
KATHY: Yes , I , yes , I signed it , yes . But I , I did n't write that figure .
CONCANNON: You did n't write that figure . And how is it that you remember that so clearly after four years ?
KATHY: Because I kept a copy . I have it ight here . She looks toward Galvin .
CONCANNON: Objection ! This is ri expect us to accept a photocopy , we have the original right
JUDGE: I 'll rule on that presently . Proceed .
CONCANNON: what in the world would induce you to make a photocopy of some obscure record and hold it four years ? This is a why ? Why would you do that ?
KATHY: I thought I would need it .
CONCANNON: And why , please tell us , would you think that ?
KATHY: After , after the operation , when that poor girl , she went in a coma . Dr. Towler called me in . He told me he had five difficult deliveries in a row and he was tired , and he neve looked at the admittance form . And he told me to change the form . He told me to change the one to a nine . Or else , or else , he said He said he 'd fire me . He said I 'd never work again Who were these men ? Who were these men ? I wanted to be a nurse
CONCANNON: No further questions .
JUDGE: You may step down .
GALVIN: Nothing further , your Honor
JUDGE: Mr. Concannon ?
CONCANNON: Thank you , your Honor . We object to the copy of the admissions form as incompetent and essentially hearsay evidence and cite McGee versus State of Indiana , U.S. 131 point 2 and 216 through 25 of the Uniform Code 'The admission of a duplicate document in preference to an existing original must presuppose the possibility of alteration and so must be disallowed . ' And , your Honor , having given the Plaintiff the leeway we would like your ruling on this issue now we object to the admission of the Xerox form .
JUDGE: one moment , Mr. Concannon
JUDGE: The document is disallowed , the jury will be advised not to consider the testimony of Kathy Costello regarding the Xerox form . It 's unsubstantiated and we ca n't accept a copy in preference to the original
CONCANNON: Thank you , your Honor . Further Ms. Costello is a rebuttal witness . As a 'Surprise Witness ' she may only serve to rebut direct testimony . As he only evidentiary rebuttal was the admitting form , which has been disallowed I request that her entire testimony be disallowed and the jury advised that they must totally disregard her appearance here .
JUDGE: I 'm going to uphold that .
GALVIN: I object , your Honor
JUDGE: Overruled
GALVIN: Exception !
JUDGE: Noted . Thank you . Miss Costello was a rebuttal witness . Her sole rebuttal was the document , which has been disallowed
ALITO: Legally it 's over . Concannon was illiant .
BROPHY: Tell me about Kaitlin Costello .
ALITO: There 's nothing to tell . It 's been stricken from the record .
BROPHY: I know . Did you believe her ?
JUDGE SWEENEY: Mr. Galvin ?
GALVIN: You know , so much of the time we 're lost . We say , 'Please , God , tell us what is right . Tell us what 's true . There is no justice . The rich win , the poor are powerless ' We become tired of hearing people lie . After a time we become dead . A little dead . We start thinking of ourselves as victims . And we become victims . And we become weak and doubt ourselves , and doubt ou institutions and doubt ou eliefs we say for example , 'The law is a sham there is no law I was a fool for having believed there was . ' But today you are the law . You are the law And not some book and not the lawyers , or the marble statues and the trappings of the court all that they are is symbols . Of our desire to be just All that they are , in effect , is a prayer a fervent , and a frightened prayer .
JUDGE: Have you reached a verdict ?
FOREMAN: Your Honor , we have agreed to hold for the Plaintiff but on the size of the award , are we bound
JUDGE: You are not bound by anything , othe than your good judgment , based on the evidence .
JUDGE: Yes . You are .
MICKEY: The jury might be out for awhile . You want to run across the street and get a drink ?

FISHER: I did n't mean to Liz . I 'm sorry .
LIZ: You ca n't play around with these tent people .
FISHER: I 'm not playing around . I forgot .
LIZ: What else have you forgot ?
FISHER: How could I know what else I forgot ?
LIZ: I 'm working my ass off here . I 've taken care of absolutely everything Keith .

LIZ: Well it 's bad timing .
FISHER: How do you figure ?
LIZ: Right before the wedding ?
FISHER: It 's a bachelor party . You sort of have to do it before the wedding .
LIZ: I suppose Boyd is the creative force ehind all this .
FISHER: He is .
LIZ: He 's a moron .
FISHER: He 's my friend . He 's not a moron .

BOYD: David Boyd . Tina . Great . Okay . Here 's the deal , we 're talking five guys . Hard Rock . Nice guys Tina . My friends . Yeah . I 'm calling you directly so you do n't have to go through the agency
MAN: We 're just trying to sneak a peak .
BOYD: Just stay off the property until I 'm off the phone .
MAN: Why ?
BOYD: Cause that 's the way they do it .
LIZ: Why do you feel the need to explore this side of your personality ?
FISHER: What are you talking about ?
LIZ: I 'm talking about the kind of people you hang out with about growing up , assuming responsibility of yourself .
FISHER: I asked you to marry me . I 'm ready for marriage . That 's responsibility . That 's growth .
LIZ: I just think that at some point you 're going to have to re-evaluate some of your friendships
FISHER: Who else ?
LIZ: Charles Moore for instants .
FISHER: You do n't like Moore ? Since when ?
LIZ: It 's not that I do n't like him . But the wedding has really got me thinking and I just keep myself opening up . Growning . And I want you keeping up with me here .
FISHER: What does Moore have to do with you growing ?
LIZ: I just do n't see him in the big picture .
FISHER: I 've known him since Cub Scouts .
LIZ: He 's weird .
FISHER: He 's quiet .
LIZ: He 's weird .
FISHER: He just does n't talk a lot .
LIZ: Why ? What 's his problem ?
FISHER: He 's a great chef .
LIZ: He 's weird . And I expect more from you .
FISHER: You expect more what ?

FISHER: Time out .
LIZ: It 's vile ! People are staring .
FISHER: That 's absurd .
LIZ: I 've seen it on television .
FISHER: I 'm not going to marry you with the smell of prostitutes on my body .
LIZ: I am not common Keith . I am not common . I am a creature like no othe and I will not be commoned ! Is that to much to ask ? Is that to much to ask ! ? !
FISHER: You will not be common ! ! !

MICHAEL: Mike Brenn . Yes . Yes . 14.3 at 7.5 for 6 . At 29.83 at 9 . I 'm amazed the windows do n't blow out of their fucking sockets with all the repressed , ass-puckering age in these soul-less lizards .

LOIS: Notice how clean and well-behaved they all appear , respectable members of modern society . Timmy , Adam Jr. , take a good look at this
LIZ: embarrassing , shameful
LOIS: regression of Modern Man to his most primitive , ape-like state
LIZ: The stone age .
LOIS: The post-Vegas Man .
LIZ: A mutant species .
LOIS: Okay boys , smile ! Lois clicks off photos of the men .
LIZ: Will you please call the chair people ?
FISHER: I will .
LIZ: Do you love me ?

FISHER: I love you .
LIZ: Have a nice bachelor party .
ADAM: Not on your life .
BOYD: You 're a fucking moron .
MICHAEL: It 's my fucking opinion .
ADAM: It 's really a stupid opinion . You have developed an annoying habit of talking for what seems to be no othe eason than to hear yourself speak .
MICHAEL: Because my opinion threatens yours , it 's poorly developed ?
ADAM: No , because your opinions are idiotic and have nothing to do with what any given conversation is about , which makes 85 % of your eagerly injected thought process highly offensive to me .
MICHAEL: Boyd brought up divorce statistics .
BOYD: The hell I did !
MICHAEL: The hell you did n't !
BOYD: The hell I did !
MICHAEL: You said one in two marriages end in divorce .
BOYD: I never heard that .
FISHER: You said that Boyd .
BOYD: Well , I did n't mean it .
MICHAEL: You 're an asshole Adam .
ADAM: You 're an asshole .
MICHAEL: Oh , and why am I an asshole ?
ADAM: Multiple reasons .
MICHAEL: Name one .
ADAM: I do n't have to
FISHER: SHUT UP !
BOYD: Four hours and fifteen minutes . I can make Vegas in 3 and change .
ADAM: I 'm not getting a ticket .
FISHER: Tony ? This is Keith Fisher . You 're doing my wedding and I 'm calling about the chair situation . Yeah , I 'll hold .

BOYD: You want to hear me out ?
MICHAEL: Nope .
BOYD: Moore ?
MOORE: No I do n't .
BOYD: Fish ?
FISHER: Not really . Yes , the Fisher wedding chairs
BOYD: Prison Communication Systems . An acquaintance friend of mine is professionally involved with a communications outfit in Denver that I just happen to know for a fact is about to be rewarded a very large , exclusive contract to rewire every state prison in Colorado . Yes sir . Nobody gives a fuck .
FISHER: No , I 'm holding for Tony . In chairs . Keith Fisher . Okay .
BOYD: That would translate to government guaranteed contract in excess of 35 million dollars .
FISHER: We need padded chairs .
BOYD: Or a stock kick of approximately 125 % on shares which are currently sitting around $ 4.38 , or , in plain English
ADAM: SHUT UP !
MICHAEL: NO !
BOYD: What is wrong with you people ? I 'm a helper here .
MOORE: Your investment ideas never work out .
BOYD: That 's the whole point . They rarely work out . But on occasion they do . And when they do , they do big .
MICHAEL: Your ideas never work out .
BOYD: Oh really ? Starbucks ?
ADAM: That 's one idea .
FISHER: No we want padded chairs okay ?
BOYD: One idea that if you had fucking listened to , you would each be worth approximately 15 million dollars .
ADAM: You ca n't keep bringing up Starbucks . That was your only real hit in like 75 tries .
BOYD: I set up Fisher with the broker that found his house . Took care of that one , did n't I ? Prison Communications .
MOORE: I do n't think so Boyd .
BOYD: Fine . Do n't come crying to Boyd . No sir .
ADAM: All the bullshit aside Fish , we 've een coming up here for what , eight years ?
BOYD: More .
ADAM: Over eight years of some of the hardest raging experiences of my life .
MOORE: Good times .
MICHAEL: Drum banging real times .
FISHER: Real times .
ADAM: They 've all been real times . And as you prepare to enter into a new phase of life , as you prepare for new roles ; father , husband , teacher , you will , as I have , come to except the letting go of of old ways . Soon , the mellowing will begin
BOYD: But not tonight .
MOORE: Not tonight .
ADAM: Tonight we return once again to the cave . Tonight we let the monsters out . We fill ourselves with the spirits of Genghis Kahn , Joe Namath , JFK , Paton , Lombardi , Hemingway
MICHAEL: Franco mother-fucking Harris !
MOORE: Keith Richards , Dean Martin
BOYD: Jack Kerouback , Herman Melville , Henry Miller and Hunter S. Thompson . I dedicate this evening to fear and to major loathing . So from sun set to sun rise , let me be heard
ALL: He who acts the beast , rids himself of the pain of being a man !
FISHER: Hi .
LIZ: Hi . Are you calling from jail ?
BOYD: I do n't hate women .
MICHAEL: You hate women .
BOYD: False .
MICHAEL: True .
BOYD: Not true .
MICHAEL: You have a King fantasy .
BOYD: I am a lover . In Africa , you can stay king as long as you can service your women every night .
MICHAEL: And what happens when you ca n't ?
BOYD: New king .
ADAM: No . No . No . It 's what my father said to me . He said it and he meant it He said to me He said , Adam , he said He told me and I heard him he said Hell he said so many Goddamn things I ca n't remember everything he said for Christsake .
FISHER: Right ! That 's exactly what I 'm saying . My father said , first of all , I 'm your father not your friend . I 'm your father .
ADAM: Are you solid with that ?
FISHER: No . I think it 's fucked .
ADAM: Then fuck what your father said , cause I 'm gon na tell you right now You 'll know what it 's all about , why you got married and why you love he when you wake up at three in the morning , and the streetlight 's coming through the window and it 's just catching a corner of her face , like a sleeping angel . And her hair smells sweet and she 's your 's . She 's all your 's . Do you see where I 'm going here ?
BOYD: If I 'm the king of Israel , I say to myself , King , I say to myself , King Take a good look around . What do I see ?
MICHAEL: Israel does n't have a King .
BOYD: Then what do they have ?
MICHAEL: They have a president . A Benjamin Yahoo something .
BOYD: I say to myself , look at the map . Look what 's all around you . People who wish bad bad things for you and your people . For thousands of years the Jews are fighting everybody . It used to be they 'd throw rocks , then the iron revolution and they would attack with spears . Then the gunpowde evolution . Now they 're shooting fire power back and forth , all day ullets flying , babies getting shot .
MICHAEL: What 's your point ?
BOYD: Now if I 'm the King of Israel and all these sand niggers are armed to the gills and you know it 's just a matter of time right ? Am I right ?
MICHAEL: The Israelis can protect themselves . They got the Mossad thing happening . Mossad 's for real , man . They scalp abies .
BOYD: There 's my point exactly .
MICHAEL: What ? What 's your point ?
BOYD: Take Mexico .
MICHAEL: What ?
BOYD: Look up the chickens , dig up the holy dirt , pack up the wailing crying wall thing they bang their heads on all day long , stick it all on a big fucking tug boat . The whole country picks up and takes Mexico .
FISHER: The bucks gon na stop right here . If my son does n't know the six New England states , if he has trouble with geography , I wo n't stick it in his face . I 'll help the little guy . I 'll put him in the car and take him out there . I 'll take him to Maine for a big Lobster dinner , go skiing in Vermont , hot dogs at Yankee Stadium I wo n't stare him down .
ADAM: Do n't ever stare him down .
FISHER: I wo n't do it .
ADAM: Do n't eyeball your kids .
BOYD: The Mexicans would love it . They 're dying for a little order down there . They need direction .
MICHAEL: They need leadership .
BOYD: That 's what I 'm saying . Let the Israelis straighten it up . They got plenty of room down there , numbe one . Plus , and this is just a plus , they kind of look alike the Jews and the Mexicans . So I think on a whole your average Joe Mexican is gon na have less of a problem getting his head around the whole assimilation thing . Am I right ? The DOOR BELL RINGS .
ADAM: I tell mine that they 're little men . I tell them they 're strong . They make me feel joy . I let 'em know . So they really know that I need them just as much . You know . Just as much man . And you know , you 're thei godfather
FISHER: I know and I 'm honored
ADAM: If anything ever happens to me
FISHER: I know
ADAM: Y'see ? That 's the real point here . That 's what I 'm driving for , when the big storm comes and knocks down all the forests and the rocks fall down and the leave 's are bare . What 's left ? The little trees , the little fellas that the storm did n't see . The tiny little Moore is on the balcony .
MOORE: The stripper 's here .
ADAM: Excellent . He and Fisher stagger aside .
BOYD: Gentlemen , this is Tina . The guys , wasted , attempt to greet Tina .
TINA: Who 's the lucky groom ?
MICHAEL: God , I love women .
BOYD: She 's all your 's Fish . Anything you want . Happy bachelor party .
FISHER: I ca n't .
MICHAEL: I 'll take a ride .
FISHER: Go for it .
MICHAEL: Come on .
TINA: You said just dancing .
BOYD: I 'll take good care of you .
TINA: With him . Lucky me .
MOORE: She 's fucking hot !
ADAM: I need a drink .
BOYD: Tequila
TINA: Oh come on .
MICHAEL: I want to play .
TINA: It 's gon na cost extra .
MICHAEL: I will pay .
TINA: Easy baby , easy .
MOORE: Cool .
MOORE: Jesus .
ADAM: Do n't touch her . Call 911 .
MICHAEL: I was just playing we were playing just playing around .
ADAM: She 's dead .
FISHER: No No .
MOORE: How do you know she 's dead .
ADAM: She 's got no fucking pulse .
BOYD: You do n't know what you 're doing .
MOORE: Left side .
ADAM: Either side you idiot . I 'm calling
FISHER: What happened ? Oh my God
MICHAEL: We were playing she slipped she hit her head .
ADAM: Playing ?
BOYD: Wait !
ADAM: What ?
BOYD: What are you doing ?
ADAM: What are you talking about ?
BOYD: What do you think you are doing ?
ADAM: I 'm calling the ambulance .
BOYD: Just wait a second . Wait one second . Okay . What are you doing ?
ADAM: Calling the ambulance .
BOYD: Why ? Why ? She 's dead . Why are you calling an ambulance ? A reasonable point . BEAT .
ADAM: We have to call the ambulance .
BOYD: Why ? Fisher entering , freaked
FISHER: Oh , Jesus call the police .
BOYD: No .
FISHER: She 's dead . Call somebody !
BOYD: Shut up .
FISHER: Call 911 .
BOYD: Shut up .
MICHAEL: She slipped .
ADAM: What did you do ?
MICHAEL: You never heard of accidents ? ! Get off me !
BOYD: Everybody shut up . LISTEN TO ME !
ADAM: Her head 's bashed in and her heart is n't beating .
MOORE: She 's dead .
MICHAEL: It was an accident !
BOYD: Are you sure this was an accident ?
ADAM: You 're a lying deviant . What did you do ? !
MICHAEL: The floor was wet . She slipped !
ADAM: Why was the floor wet ?
MICHAEL: I do n't know why the floor was wet !
ADAM: Why ? !
BOYD: Stop it ! Listen to me . Let 's just take a second here and take hold of the situation , OK ? Let 's just review our options here .
ADAM: We have a dead woman bleeding all over the bathroom . What options ? Call the police .
BOYD: Call the police . Okay , that 's one option .
ADAM: That is not an `` option . '' There is no multiple choice here .
BOYD: Yes sir , there sure is an option here . There are always options . ON Fisher and Moore .
MOORE: I 've never seen a dead person .
FISHER: Fuck ! Fuck you fucking guys !
BOYD: Well we can definitely call the police . That 's an easy call . If we call the police What happens ? They find a dead prostitute in the athroom They ask us What happened ? We say , ah our friend , Michael Your brother got a little out of control they were making love and he got a little excited and he , ah , sort of beat her head into the side of a toilet , while he choked her to death with a rubber hose
ADAM: Stop it !
BOYD: There 's more .
ADAM: Just stop .
BOYD: Just giving the facts .
ADAM: I 'm calling the police .
BOYD: What were we doing officer ? Why did n't we help her ? Well we 're all a bit high , you know , bachelor party , that kind of thing . Fisher here is getting married in three days Beautiful wife he did n't have anything at all to do with it It was all Michael here just Michael
ADAM: You do n't play games with Homicide police . There are no options here . There is not the luxury of worrying about how the fallout will settle .
BOYD: I 've known him for while maybe twenty years kind of a close friend but hey what the heck officer , take him away , go on it 's for his own good .
FISHER: What are you talking about ? Adam 's ight . We do n't have a choice here Boyd I mean what are you talking about ? What options ? ? ?
BOYD: Bury her out in the desert .
ADAM: Sure , why not .
MOORE: He 's right .
BOYD: We can take her out to Red Rock . Find some quiet place and put he in the ground .
ADAM: You do n't just casually walk out of a Vegas Casino with a dead woman .
BOYD: We can do this . We can get her out of here .
ADAM: Have you completely lost your mind ? So you get her out of here . So you get her out into the desert somehow , without anybody seeing , so what , you do n't think at some point somebody might notice that she 's gone ?
BOYD: Nobody knows she 's here . I called her personally . Nobody knows .
FISHER: Oh for Christsake Boyd . Somebody must know she 's here .
BOYD: Nobody knows . PAUSE , as the guys digest this point .
ADAM: Her blood is all over the bathroom . I 'd say that 's a bit of a DNA problem .
BOYD: It 's a marble floor , we can clean it up .
FISHER: Oh God . This is insane .
BOYD: What 's insane is the fact that Michael here put a fucking girl 's head through a toilet . That 's insane .
MOORE: They 'll get us on accessory to murder .
ADAM: Bullshit it 's not accessory . I did n't do shit . You call the cops , you explain it was an accident
BOYD: Her fucking head was caved in .
ADAM: So ! I did n't fucking do it !
BOYD: She 's got bondage burns on her wrists . There 's blow all over the room , Moore looks like he went at it with a mountain lion . This room looks like the Manson Family stayed here a month . Michael goes down , we all go down .
MOORE: I 'm not going to ruin my life over a dead whore .
ADAM: That 's a horrible ugly comment . `` Dead whore ? '' She 's a person !
FISHER: I 'm getting married
MICHAEL: I 'm sorry I 'm sorry I 'm sorry
ADAM: I 've got a wife and two boys .
BOYD: Lets take a vote . A simple vote . Two choices ; we clean up the mess . Right now . Bury it in the desert , go home , and never look back . Or , we can call the police Open those doors , roll the dice and hope that it 's only Michael who falls . Let 's take a vote . Desert or police ? BOYD looks around . BEAT . Raises his hand .
MOORE: Fucking desert .
BOYD: Nobody knows she 's here .
FISHER: Good God Good God
ADAM: How do we get her out of here ? A reasonable question . Boyd thinks . BEAT .
BOYD: Wrap her up in blankets . Bring the car around to the back of the hotel , throw her off the balcony , put he in the car Done .
ADAM: You do n't think someone will have a problem with a body being thrown off a balcony ?
BOYD: We check out the area and wait for a time when it 's clear .
ADAM: What about the blood ?
BOYD: Someone goes to Walmart , gets some uckets , brushes , mops , Spic and Span , the works .
ADAM: Have you ever done this before ?
BOYD: The reality is , you take away the horror of this situation , take away the tragedy of the death , take away the moral and ethical implications of all the crap you have had conditioned , beaten , into your head since grade one . What are we left with ? What ? A 115 lb . problem . 115 lbs . that must be moved from point A to point B . Now , a straight line in the shortest distance but we are denied the luxury of a visible straight line . But that line exists and I see it . I see that line . Trust me . Adam . Trust me I can take care of this .
BOYD: What is it ?
RALPH: Okay . Hi .
BOYD: Who ?
RALPH: The groom ?
FISHER: Me .
RALPH: Cool You all dudes from L.A. ?
BOYD: Yup .
RALPH: Doing the bachelor party thing ?
BOYD: That 's right .
RALPH: Sin City . Devil 's Playground . The Black Bitch . All day every day . Where 's Tina ?
BOYD: She 's in the bathroom she 's still working .
RALPH: She 's still working ?
BOYD: That 's right .
RALPH: Sweet deal .
BOYD: Great . Fine . Perfect . More SILENCE .
RALPH: I 'm gon na just tell her I 'm waiting . He starts for the bathroom .
BOYD: She 's in there !
RALPH: I 'm just gon na let her know I 'm here .
BOYD: Help me ! Do n't let him bleed on the carpet !
MOORE: Oh God .
BOYD: All right people . New plan . Not even a new plan so much as a modification of the old plan .
FISHER: I 'm calling the police .
BOYD: So help me God you touch that phone and I bury you with them . Surrender is no longer an option . I epeat It is not an option . Is there anyone who does not understand that ?
MICHAEL: Not really . no .
BOYD: Not a problem . Understand not my words , but follow my orders . Follow my orders
ADAM: I 'm not wrecking the transmission !
BOYD: What ?
ADAM: We ca n't do this .
BOYD: We 've already done this .
ADAM: No , I mean the suitcases . We ca n't ury them in suitcases .
MICHAEL: Why ?
ADAM: It 's sacrilegious .
BOYD: How do you figure ?
ADAM: According to Jewish law , the blood and limbs are considered to be part of the human being . They must be uried together or their souls wo n't est in peace .
BOYD: So that 's what we 're doing .
ADAM: No we 're not . The bodies are all mixed up . We ca n't do this to them .
BOYD: She 's Asian . They do n't have Jews in Asia .
ADAM: That is absolutely not true .
BOYD: Well what the fuck are we supposed to do ?
ADAM: Open the suitcases , unpack the body parts and reunite the limbs .
FISHER: No way .
ADAM: It has to be done .
BOYD: We have to get going .
ADAM: I am not flexible on this .
BOYD: Alright . Let 's do it .
MOORE: Here 's his head . As the guys put limbs with bodies
BOYD: Now I am the last to say that we have done here is a good thing . It 's not . It 's not a good thing . But it was , given the circumstances , the smart play . We did what had to be done . And well I 'm proud of us . I 'm proud of each and every one of us . We performed . Under the most complex and nerve shattering of situations , we stood fast and we delivered . I feel proud .
ADAM: We are all going straight to hell . Either hell or prison , whicheve comes first .
BOYD: Wrong . That is flat out wrong . hell is for cowards , for hypocrites who fear to live by the strength of thei own convictions . This is war . Given the circumstances and given the fact that we are alive and they are not , we have chosen life over death . Two wrongs do n't make a right . So ou conviction and execution would only mean more death here , not less .
MOORE: Boyd I do n't know man It just seems to me that ever since you took Tony Robbins self-help thing you 're all fucked-up in the head .
FISHER: I got to agree with that .
BOYD: That is a load of shit . Personal power has nothing to do with any of this . Tony Robbins has helped me to unlock energy and see my options more clearly , yes , but to give him credit for this , for all of this Well that 's just more than the man deserves .
FISHER: I think we should say some words over the grave .
BOYD: What kind of words ?
FISHER: I 'm talking about prayer .
BOYD: Go ahead . Fisher steps to the grave , looks down .
FISHER: Dear God I do n't know how to pray .
MICHAEL: Just go ahead and say what 's on you mind .
BOYD: Speak from the heart my brother . Adam turns in disgust .
ADAM: This is pathetic .
MICHAEL: You 're pathetic .
ADAM: What did you say ?
MICHAEL: You 're not a team player .
ADAM: Do n't point at me .
MICHAEL: You never were a team player . That 's why you never had any friends .
ADAM: I have plenty of friends .
MICHAEL: The hell you do .
ADAM: The hell I do n't .
MICHAEL: You have acquaintances business friends and superficial golf buddies . You have always been a fringe player . You have some serious male on male intimacy problems .
ADAM: What are you fucking talking about ? Michael looks at Boyd .
FISHER: Michael , now is probably not the est time for this .
BOYD: No , this is the perfect time . This is real time . Adam . Your brother and I , as well as several others present , have always suspected that you are a fully repressed , living in major denial , locked down , fly-boy utt-fucker .
FISHER: Dear God , please forgive us for what we have done here tonight . We have lost our way . Speaking for myself , let me say
FISHER: Hey . It 's me .
ADAM: I want you to hear me out .
FISHER: What .
ADAM: You and I have done nothing . You especially . We are innocent .
FISHER: I do n't think so .
ADAM: We are . We go to the police . We tell them the truth . Now . Before they find out . Now . We save ourselves .
BOYD: Let 's go ! Adam stares daggers into Fisher .
ADAM: We save ourselves . It 's our only chance .
BOYD: The past is the past . Today is the eginning of the rest of our lives .
MOORE: Today is the best day of the rest of our lives .
FISHER: The first day .
MOORE: What ?
FISHER: It goes ; `` Today is the first day of the rest of our lives . ''
BOYD: However it goes , the point is , nobody says anything to anyone ever . Right ? Right ?
MICHAEL: Right .
MOORE: That 's right .
BOYD: You 're goddamn right . Adam ?
ADAM: Right .
LOIS: Group shot . Here we go boys ! Yes sir , compare and contrast time !
LIZ: What 's the word on the chairs ?
FISHER: I 'm working on it .
LIZ: Then you 'd better work on it in the car . We got ta go see the Judge .
JUDGE TOWER: We do n't say `` love , honor and obey '' anymore . And we do n't say `` till death do us part . '' Today we say , `` respect , honor and cherish , as long as you oth do love . '' How does that sound ?
LIZ: I kind of like `` till death do us part . '' I mean , this is forever . In sickness and in health , through good times and bad . Honey , what do you think ?
FISHER: Yea It 's great seems like I do n't know you 've got all the important stuff in there .
JUDGE TOWER: All right then . It 's refreshing to see two young people not afraid of eal commitment . Will you have friends or family saying words singing o anything ?
FISHER: Are we supposed to ?
JUDGE TOWER: It 's not a question of supposed to , it 's an entirely personal decision Some do some do n't .
LIZ: We do n't think so . I mean , we just want the singing when I come out .
JUDGE TOWER: Okay great . What will that be ?
LIZ: We 're just going to have the leade of the band sing alone with his guitar . Acoustic .
JUDGE TOWER: What song ?
LIZ: `` You Send Me . ''
JUDGE TOWER: Oh I know that . How does it go
LIZ: You know , Darling you you send me Darling you You mend me . Honey , sing it for Judge Tower . In lieu of an anxiety attack , Fisher
FISHER: `` Darliing you , ewe ewe ewe , send me , Darliing you , ewe ewe ewe , mend me .
LIZ: `` At first I thought it was infatuation But oh it 's lasted so long ''
MR. FISHER: I wanted to just take this final opportunity to visit with you . You know , just to be with you , fathe and son , before you run off and do your own husband , daddy thing . I 'm just so goddamn proud of you God knows I did n't always play it ight with you
FISHER: You did all right dad .
MR. FISHER: I could have done it better . I 'm a fucking ball-buster I am .
FISHER: You never walked away dad . You could have walked away .
MR. FISHER: I 'm just so scared of that song . That fucking , `` My son just arrived the other day he says thanks fo the ball , come on let 's play . I got lots of bills come again next day . He 's grown up just like me My boy is just like me . '' Gordon fucking Lightfoot , Cat Stevens , whoever , that song just fucking kills me .
FISHER: Harry Chaplin . `` Cats in the Cradle . ''
MR. FISHER: Just kills me
FISHER: I love you dad .
MR. FISHER: I love you so much it hurts . Me and your mother marvel at what you have ecome . You 're going to have a wonderful journey with this girl . I feel it deep inside . A wonderful , magical journey . And I 'm , like I said , just so proud of how you turned out . You go out and knock 'em dead Keith . Knock 'em dead ! Off Fisher we
FISHER: Where did you get that ?
MICHAEL: At the newsstand on 3rd .
ADAM: Fucking Boyd . That fucking idiot . They 're on to us .
MICHAEL: They 're not on to us . I 'm gon na call Boyd . Michael picks up the phone .
BOYD: Oh that 's just nothing . That 's just a missing persons thing , that 's all .
MICHAEL: You said nobody would miss her .
BOYD: No . I said nobody knew she was coming to the hotel .
ADAM: Boyd you idiot , the shit 's coming down !
BOYD: What does that mean ?
ADAM: You got us into this mess .
BOYD: Oh I did ? I think it was your little at fuck brother who decided to play Hamburger Helper with the hooker 's head .
ADAM: Would you , shush ? ! These phones are n't secure !
BOYD: Lighten up Adam . Show some character .
ADAM: Do n't talk to me about character .
BOYD: Watch the tone fella . Fisher realizes he 's not breathing .
ADAM: Fuck you Boyd !
BOYD: Any time fat boy !
LIZ: I love it . I just love , love , love , love it .
MAGGIE: Are you guys gon na fill this place with kids ? You sure got room fo them .
LIZ: We 're in no hurry . I think we 'll take some time to enjoy each other , enjoy our freedom before we surrende ourselves to kids .
MAGGIE: Take your time . I wish I had .
LIZ: We will .
MAGGIE: So where to on the honeymoon ?
FISHER: This is our honeymoon .
LIZ: After the wedding , which we 're paying for ourselves , and this house
MAGGIE: Smart . Smart . Smart . Think big picture , take your time . I wish I had .
LIZ: That 's our plan .
MAGGIE: Well , I just need your signature on these contracts and a deposit check so I can get the ball rolling .
FISHER: How much ?
MAGGIE: Five percent should be fine for now , which is , let 's see , twenty thousand dollars . Of course I 'll be splitting my commission with your friend . He is a very sweet man .
KIDS: `` Do your balls hang low , do they wobble to and fro , can you tie 'em in a knot , can you tie 'em in a bow ? ''
ADAM: Knock it off !
LOIS: Do n't snap at them !
ADAM: They 're driving me nuts !
LOIS: They 're singing .
ADAM: It 's a disgusting song .
SUIT: How ya doing ?

KIDS: Dad ? !

ADAM: I got a migraine like a little monkey kicking in the side of my skull , Mike Tyson with a fucking sledge hammer trying to crack
FISHER: I got you .
ADAM: Where 's the bathroom ?
MR. FISHER: And this is Keith at age four and his best friend `` Bunker the Mule . '' Evidently , when they were in camp , Keith and Boyd got into some serious arguments over exactly who was Keith 's est friend Boyd or the mule .
BOYD: Fisher had a less than normal elationship with that Donkey .
FISHER: You always were a jealous man .
MR. FISHER: After camp came football , and fo those of you not following the sports pages back in 1977 , you might not emember the Peewee Powerhouse Oklahoma , who , under the brilliant leadership of your 's truly , rolled to an auspicious league record of 0- 12 scoring exactly zero touchdowns .
MICHAEL: The problem was coaching . Poo leadership .
BOYD: The problem was our quarterback had trouble remembering his right from left
FISHER: No , the problem , as I recall , was the lack of blocking
ADAM: I ca n't fucking breathe . I 'm sorry .
BOYD: OK. Definitely not cool ! Definitely inappropriate behavior here .
FISHER: Shut up Boyd .
BOYD: Negative . This is not what we have worked out in terms of presented ehavior .
FISHER: He 's having a problem here .
MICHAEL: What 's the problem Adam ? Moore joins the group .
MOORE: What 's the problem ?
BOYD: What is your problem ?
ADAM: I ca n't do this .
MOORE: Ca n't do what ?
ADAM: We 're gon na get caught . I know we 're gon na get caught . They were eyeballing my car .
BOYD: What ?
ADAM: At the seven-eleven .
BOYD: Who ? What are you talking about ?
ADAM: They 're on me . They 're smoking me out !
BOYD: Nobody 's smoking anybody out .
FISHER: Shut up .
MOORE: Quiet . Liz is at the door of the restaurant .
LIZ: Keith ? Is everything okay , honey ? Fisher bolts over to Liz .
FISHER: Yeah baby . Everything 's great .
LIZ: Well , can you come back inside ?
FISHER: Yeah . Sure .

LIZ: Are they fighting ?
FISHER: No baby . We 'll all be right in .
BOYD: This is going to stop right now . Right now !
MICHAEL: You will not screw this up .
ADAM: Do n't you threaten me you little rat fuck .
MICHAEL: Do n't you fucking threaten me I 'll fucking kill you .
ADAM: Go home !
MICHAEL: You go home ! Boyd pulls Michael to his car .
BOYD: Why do n't you just cool out . Go home and go to sleep . Boyd opens Michael 's car door , puts him in .
ADAM: No . I 'm not Boyd . I am not cool at all . Reluctantly , they start back in .
MICHAEL: Mr. Fucking Minivan He hits the gas .
ADAM: NOOOO ! ! ! !
BOYD: It was just a crazy freak accident . He thought the car was in reverse He did n't realize . The COP takes notes .
COP: Was there some sort of an argument ?
FISHER: No . Nothing like that .
COP: We heard there was some arguing going on . Some loud talk .
BOYD: No . No . We were just all outside just talking .
COP: What were you talking about ?
BOYD: The wedding . We were talking bout how it was going to be one of the last times for us to all be togethe with Fisher not being married
COP: A lot of people seem to think there was some hostility out there .
BOYD: Well I ca n't really comment on what `` a lot of people '' thought . I can only tell you that we had a horrible accident here and were all feeling extremely traumatized and you questions are a bit poorly timed . We 're in full on grieving mode right now thank you very much Officer Randone .
FISHER: Easy Boyd .
BOYD: No easy Boyd ! I got a best friend in there in pieces . How about a little sensitivity ?
COP: That 's all I wanted to know . A DOCTOR appears in the doorway .
DOCTOR: His situation is critical . He 's asking to speak to his wife .
BOYD: The need to know is clear . What did Adam tell Lois ? That 's the name of the game . What did Adam tell Lois ? What does Lois know ?
MICHAEL: Ball park sausages .
BOYD: You want some breakfast meat , Michael . Is that what you want ?
MICHAEL: Franco Harris has a flare for the dramatic . The former Pittsburgh Steeler running back , beat known fo `` The Immaculate Reception , '' his improbable sixty yard Ricochet Reception . I say Ricochet Reception has made a bold move on corporate America . Harris has lead a group of investors in the purchase of the Park Sausage Company . By taking on the challenge of resurrecting Park 's , Harris is engaged in the equivalent of a sudden death overtime .
BOYD: Easy Michael .
MICHAEL: He must take an open-field run to profitability through excessive debt large competitors and dwindling market share . Before the clock runs out . CUSTOMERS are starting to pay notice .
MOORE: Shut up Michael .
BOYD: Okay . Time to fly .
MICHAEL: I ran down my brother in cold blood . Shame on me ! Shame ! Shame ! Shame !
FISHER: Thank you . She watches them haul Michael outside .
MICHAEL: `` Kill one man and you are a murderer ! Kill millions and you are a conqueror Kill all and you are a God ! ''
BOYD: You will get yourself together here mister . Are you hearing me ?
FISHER: He 's cracked up .
BOYD: He is not cracking up .
FISHER: Boyd What have we done ?
BOYD: What did you ask me ?
FISHER: What ?
BOYD: What is the question you asked me ?
FISHER: I said , what have we done ?
BOYD: Yes , you did . Now that is the question ! That is exactly the question we should be asking ourselves . You tell me Fisher . What have we done ?
FISHER: I do n't know ! I just want to get married .
BOYD: Say it again .
FISHER: What ?
BOYD: What you just said . Say it again .

BOYD: Exactly ! Exactly my point .
MOORE: What 's your fucking point ?
BOYD: I 'm not talking to you ?
FISHER: What 's your point ?

You are walking the walk . This is it Fisher , the real stuff . You love this woman . Love is second to nothing . I love you . I love Moore . I love Michael . This car is full of love , and nothing absolutely nothing supersedes love , man . Nothing . We will do what it takes . Whatever it takes .
LIZ: Cancel ? ! Cancel ? ! Are you out of your fucking mind ? !
FISHER: Nobody 's saying cancel . I 'm talking about modifying .
LIZ: No way .
FISHER: Can we just talk this out ?
LIZ: Talk what out ? We are locked and loaded here . We are non-refundable . I 've got relatives on the airport ight now ! I 've got The phone RINGS . Fisher freezes .
FISHER: Hello ?
LOIS: Keith . It 's Lois . I just found a note up in Adam 's study . It 's some kind of crazy confession about killing a stripper and cutting up bodies and
FISHER: burying them outside of Vegas , about Boyd being the ring leader She wants to know what the hell is going on and I 'm starting to freak out here .
MICHAEL: We 're goosed .
BOYD: We 're not goosed .
MOORE: What 's goosed ?
BOYD: What is her disposition ?
FISHER: Regarding what ?
BOYD: Does she sound pissed , scared , hostile ? Did she mention the police ?
FISHER: No , but she 's definitely pissed and hostile . And she 's clearly starting to think that 's something 's not right . Michael starts sobbing uncontrollably .
MICHAEL: We 're goosed ! Goosed by God !
BOYD: Michael get a grip . What did you tell her ?
FISHER: I told her that I have no idea what Adam was talking about in that letter .
MOORE: Did she believe you ?
FISHER: I have no idea .
MOORE: You can tell when people believe you . It 's obvious .
FISHER: Well I do n't have that skill and if I had to guess I would say that in no way did she believe me .
MICHAEL: Goosed !
BOYD: Stop it !
MICHAEL: Goosed ! People are staring .
BOYD: Stop .

BOYD: And it was n't the first time He had a thing about prostitutes .
LOIS: My Adam ? Lois crumbles before their eyes .
BOYD: We 're sorry .

FISHER: I do n't hear it .
MICHAEL: Yeah , well , it 's a nasty problem .
FISHER: Have another drink .
MICHAEL: Dad used to bring home these sparklers to me and Adam . Out back we 'd light 'em up . The three of us . We 'd hold 'em up to the sky and watch the explosions of light . Sparks . And dad would be all `` Get ready '' `` watch for it '' `` here it comes , '' here comes the `` wahoo ''
FISHER: The wahoo ?
MICHAEL: The sparkler would burn hot , then hotter , then even hotter and there would be one moment of pure burn when that little fucker would cook just perfect . Perfect . It would only last a second , but that second was it . It was it . That 's what dad had us looking for You get me ?
FISHER: The wahoo moment ?
MICHAEL: That 's my point ! You see Man urning at his absolute . To see all the forces just come together , just ight , you know , just in perfect harmony . That 's what I 'm driving at . You get me ?
FISHER: I think so .
MICHAEL: I 've been looking for that flash and I look and I look and I ca n't find it . And what if I already had it ? You know . My moment ? What if it 's gone ? And I never saw it ?

MICHAEL: You see for me it 's over . Over baby . I 'm gon na turn myself in . After the wedding of course . After the wedding . Out of respect .

MICHAEL: I said out of respect . Respect fo you Fisher . For you and your wedding and your beautiful bride . There will e no more rain . You see where I am here ?
FISHER: I appreciate it . I do , but maybe you ought to just ease up on yourself a bit .

FISHER: A move ?
MOORE: Greenpeace .
FISHER: Greenpeace ?
MOORE: Maybe go up to the North Pole , the Arctic . Tag polar bears with dart guns . I 've always had a pretty good aim
BOYD: Michael was having an affair with Lois . That 's what Michael and Adam were arguing about in the parking lot . Michael killed Adam in a jealous age . Lois broke it off with Michael , he strangled her to death and then shot himself in the head . Happens all the time .
BARRY MORRIS: I do n't see how this could have been kept from you . The facts are quite simple ; last month Adam and Lois changed their will . They requested that you two , as a married couple , e the Custodians of Record for thei estate including all properties , cash holdings , security holdings and children . You are legal custodians of the Brenn Trust .
LIZ: My god .
BARRY MORRIS: There 's more .
FISHER: More ?
BARRY MORRIS: Adam and Lois were not terribly prudent in terms of providing fo the possibility of the unforeseen .
FISHER: What are you talking about ?
BARRY MORRIS: I 'm talking about Life insurance . I 'm talking about money .
LIZ: Money ?
BARRY MORRIS: Yes money . Adam had a five hundred thousand dollar Term Life Insurance Policy .
LIZ: What does that mean ?
FISHER: That means we get five hundred thousand to help raise the kids .
LIZ: No .
FISHER: Yes .
BARRY MORRIS: Actually , no . Adam was switching to a Whole Life Policy , but re-scheduled his medical exam and failed to make his last payment so his Term Life lapsed . So it 's value is null and void . Now he did have a pension account , worth another 150 thousand .
LIZ: Well , oh
BARRY MORRIS: And a house . Valued at 350 thousand .
LIZ: So where 's that leave us ?
FISHER: 150 plus 350 we still get 500 thousand .
BARRY MORRIS: No . Not even close . With property values down , the house is worth 100,000 less than 450 he paid fo it . With three credit cards , the minivan payments , and othe outstanding debts Plus the Income and Estate Taxes assessed on his
LITTLE ADAM: Get away from me !
FISHER: I 'm just trying to help
LITTLE ADAM: I do n't want your help !
FISHER: Stop kicking . Stop kicking !
BARRY MORRIS: So . When is the wedding .
LIZ: Tomorrow We are getting married tomorrow .
FISHER: No it 's not okay . It 's not .
LIZ: Cry for Boom Boom . It 's okay .
FISHER: Liz we 've got to cancel , we have to put it off .
LIZ: Do n't even .
FISHER: Do you love me ?
LIZ: What ?
FISHER: Do you love me ?
LIZ: What kind of stupid question is that ?
FISHER: Oh God . We . Liz . We . We . Killed a woman . We
LIZ: What are you talking about ?
FISHER: Oh Liz . We . God . We , in Vegas . Michael crushed her skull . She was dead . There was nothing else to do . It was an accident .
LIZ: Who 's dead ?
FISHER: The prostitute .
LIZ: You fucked a prostitute ?
FISHER: No Michael did . It was an accident .
LIZ: You killed a prostitute .
FISHER: Michael , by accident .
LIZ: Call the police .
FISHER: It 's too late .
LIZ: My God . You 've got to call the police , tell them it was an accident . Where is she ?
FISHER: She 's in the desert . She 's out in the desert .
LIZ: You left a dead prostitute out in the desert ? Alone ?
FISHER: She 's not alone She 's Boyd Oh God He 's gone nuts He killed Lois and Michael it 's all
LIZ: Stop ! You stop right here . I do n't want to know anymore . I told you not to do this Bachelor Party thing . You were warned .
FISHER: But
LIZ: No buts . I told you your friends were Jackasses .
FISHER: But
LIZ: No buts . I 've waited twenty-seven years , twenty-seven years I have focused and prepared to walk down that aisle . I will not be derailed ! I will not be embarrassed ! I will not be denied ! I am walking down that aisle tomorrow come hell o high fucking water !
BOYD: Okay , we 're about two minutes out . Moore , better take your position . Moore looks at Fisher .
FISHER: I 'm getting really tired of you ullshit .
BOYD: My what ?
FISHER: You 've got a warped thought process . Your brain does n't function properly .
BOYD: You care to add a little specification to that slanderous accusation ?
FISHER: I 'm talking about some bad , bad , very bad things . Bad things ! Those are bad fucking things !
BOYD: Okay fine .
FISHER: Fine ? Fine what ?
BOYD: Whatever you say Kojak .
FISHER: I 'm serious .
BOYD: I 'm serious . I 'm the serious one here . I 'm the one making the play . I 'm the Indian Runner . And I want my money .
LIZ: I told Boyd two fucking minutes !
FISHER: What money ?
BOYD: Blood money . Insurance dollars that you have thus fucking far decided not to tell me about at all . In no way have you mentioned that money . And I find that to be very very offensive .
FISHER: You 're sick .
BOYD: And if you think you can fuck me , do n't . Cause I 'm fucking insulated Fisher . Protected . Backed up on floppy . Do you get me ? I want my fucking money !
FISHER: Not a prayer .
BOYD: I 'm a lifesaver . A lighthouse . Up all night in the rain , in stormy gale force wind , tornado and fucking earthquakes . I stay lit for you . I stay lit . I do n't go dark . I neve go dark !
FISHER: You need help .
BOYD: I want that money !
LIZ: Here comes the bride .
MOORE: Where 's Boyd ?
FISHER: Downstairs in the closet .
JUDGE TOWER: May we have the rings please ?
FISHER: What ?
JUDGE TOWER: The rings ? Fisher looks at Moore .
MOORE: Got 'em .
JUDGE TOWER: These rings represent the commitment Fisher and Liz make to each other on the day . Fisher do you take Liz to e your beloved wife , to respect , honor and cherish till death do you part ?
FISHER: I do . Liz slides the ring on Fisher 's finger .
JUDGE TOWER: Liz do you take Fisher to be you eloved husband , to respect , hono and cherish him till death do you part ?
LIZ: I do . Fisher slides the ring on Liz 's finger .
JUDGE TOWER: I now pronounce you husband and wife .
MOORE: He came to me early today , was talking about money , insurance money . Said he was gon na get what was his .
FISHER: My God
MOORE: He said he was the Brain Trust . Said he was smarter than all of us . He started reading `` Atlas Shrugged , '' staring at himself in the mirror .
FISHER: Did he try to kiss you ?
MOORE: All week long . Fisher slams the trunk closed .
FISHER: He kept saying he was protected .
LIZ: What does that mean ?
FISHER: Like if something happened to him , he could still get us .
LIZ: Like how ?
FISHER: I do n't know . He could have told someone . He could have , like in the event of his death , somehow let someone know where those bodies are uried .
LIZ: The only proof is those bodies .
FISHER: So what do we do ?
LIZ: Move the bodies .
FISHER: Move the bodies ?
OLD MAN: We just wanted to say congratulations and wish you great happiness . Mazeltov . I just did . I said Malzeltov . You neve listen to me .
OLD WOMAN: We 're your Uncle Henry 's parents . Opal and Earl . Tell them from both of us . Malzeltov . Wish them luck . The secret to a good marriage is to listen .
LIZ: Thank you . Thank you . We will . Bye ye .
FISHER: I Liz all I ever wanted , was for you to be happy . I just wanted to give you the wedding , the life you always dreamed of I just love you so much So much
LIZ: You and Moore move the bodies and ury Boyd with them . In fact , put Moore in the ground too .
FISHER: What ?
LIZ: If you do n't tie up all the lose ends it 'll never be over .
FISHER: No
LIZ: You put him down or do n't bothe coming back .
FISHER: But
LIZ: Do you love me ? DO YOU LOVE ME ? ! OFF Fisher
MOORE: You alright ?
FISHER: Yeah . I 'm thinking about Michael 's Franco Harris fixation . You know how Michael was always harping `` Immaculate Reception ? '' I 've seen that play . A lot of times and I have to say this Franco was lucky . Flat out , ight place , right time . That 's it . He was where the ball bounced . You get me ?
MOORE: I guess .
FISHER: I 'm saying it 's luck . All luck . You work your entire life , all the training , focus , all the dedication , all irrelevant . Where does the ball ounce ? My father spent his whole life trying to start a company , practiced every day , worked like a dog , finally got enough money . He 's paid the dues , he 's ready , does all the market research , picks his shot `` Pup Corn . ''
MOORE: Pup corn ?
FISHER: That 's right , `` Pup Corn . '' Doggie treats . Little snacks for dogs . He 's figured it out . There is a hole in the market and he 's going to fill it . Spends all out money , works himself into not two but three heart attacks getting this shit up . Afte fifteen months , the big day arrives , the first box of `` Pup Corn '' pops off the belt . He comes running home with that box , pulls us out of school . We all pile into the living room , must e fifty of us , and in comes `` Shelmer , '' our 8 year old mutt . `` Here Shelmer , '' my dad cries . He 's got that little fucking pup corn in his hand , `` Here girl . '' This dog will eat anything , she eats rocks , anything . She walk 's up to my dad 's hand , looks down at the little pellet , licks it once , turns around , walks out of the oom . Shelmer rejected the `` Pup Corn . '' Fifteen months of my dad 's life , ight there . Not one dog ate Pup Corn . Not one . Three months later , `` Pup Corn '' shuts down . Chapter Eleven . My father never got over it . Never . SILENCE hangs again .
MOORE: It was over by those rocks .
FISHER: There .
MOORE: Where ? Fisher moves to a new spot .
FISHER: There . This rock is where I stood when I said the prayer .
MOORE: Got it . And they dig some more .
MOORE: I 've been thinking about what you said that day . The prayer . About using this whole mess to bring out the good in me
FISHER: Yeah ?
MOORE: I think there 's a lot of truth in that . I 'm gon na pursue some options . I want to join that Big Brother thing .
FISHER: That 's a good one .
MOORE: I want a black one . A little black other . That 's a big problem it seems to me . Lack of racial integration . That 's a big one . You think ? Moore looks up to
FISHER: I think you 'd make an excellent Big Brother .
MOORE: That 's what I 'm thinking .
FISHER: Yup .
FISHER: Okay let 's try it again .
TIMMY: A scout is thrifty , saves for the future . A scout is clean , he keeps his body
FISHER: Let 's see the salutes !
TIMMY: Shut up ! Shut the fuck up !
FISHER: It 's okay , it 's okay .
THE END: < /pre
PARKER BARNES: His body is a running back 's . His endurance a marathoner 's . His face one you 'd want for your own . He 's in his 30s . If he was in his 20s , you 'd still be jealous .
JOHN: I ca n't get over how different you look .
PARKER: Five years can be a bitch , huh ?
MAITRE D': Good afternoon . May I help you ?
JOHN: Lady , move !
SID 6.7: I 'm going to rehearse with you friend a while , then I 'll be back to perform a new piece with you .
PARKER: Where 's John ?
SID 6.7: Performing solo . Enjoying the concert so far ?
PARKER: Recital 's over , asshole .
SID 6.7: . You and me are n't so different , after all
PARKER: SHIT !
SID 6.7: I told you I was going to perform a new piece with you . It 's called , `` First You Suffer , Then You Die . '' Hope you like it .
DEANE: What did Cox pull him out early for ?
WALLACE: Barnes used to work for him when he was still a cop in the field , emember ?
DEANE: Do n't remind me .
DEANE: What the hell happened ?
WALLACE: Lindenmeyer developed neural connectors that tap directly into the nervous system . If the simulator is n't calibrated properly , experiencing death in this level of VR is like experiencing death within a dream . The experience becomes real .
DEANE: Simulations are supposed to give participants practice in realistic , dangerous scenarios while protecting them from the risks they are exposed to in the real world .
WALLACE: I was assured the problem was corrected .
LINDENMEYER: I did fix it.. I told you I did . I do n't know why it happened again .
DEANE: Again ? !
COX: My first two pairs of convicts suffered the same fate .
DEANE: Why was n't I told ?
WALLACE: Black book dollars , black book operation . You pay me for results , not how for how I get you there .
COX: I 'll tell you one thing -— there is no way in hell we should allow any eal officers to train in this damn thing .
DEANE: Then about all I 've spent $ 37 million developing is a very expensive way to control the prison population .
PARKER: Heonly had a year left on his sentence .
LINDENMEYER: How much do you think I care ?
COX: I 'll walk him out .
PARKER: Why'd.. .you pull me out ?
COX: Donley started experiencing the attack for real . If I had n't gotten you out , the same thing would have happened to you . You may not believe this , Parker , ut I still consider us friends .
COX: What the hell did you have to shoot the busboy for ?
PARKER: He was a computer program fo crissake .
COX: You were supposed to act as if everything was real .
PARKER: Real , my ass . It 's an overblown game . Anybody ever catch that fucking psycho ?
COX: Before you , nobody else had gotten close enough to Sid 6.7 to take a shot at him . Hell , nobody else had even been able to start tracking him before he got to them first . New scar —— you making it okay in there ?
PARKER: I 'm getting by .
COX: ) You 've got to know I tried keeping you out of general population . Goddam politicians
PARKER: You want to know how I 'm doing ? Every day , I lose a little bit more of myself . I 'm becoming something else , and it scares the hell out of me .
COX: Do n't give up , Parker . Not ever .
PARKER: You know those cheesy Christmas cards of your family under that tree in your back yard you keep sending me every year ?
COX: What about them ?
PARKER: Do me a favor —— keep sending them .
COX: Take care , pal .
GUARD: Hey Parker —— I 'm real sorry John oy got fried . What do you think Big Red 's gon na do when he finds out you came back without his girl friend ? Parker sits in silence .
SID 6.7: Do n't be angry with me , Daryl .
LINDENMEYER: Did you recognize the son-of-a itch who got away ?
SID 6.7: Should I have ?
LINDENMEYER: Think hard it 'll come to you Wallace enters briskly .
WALLACE: You embarrassed me in front of the highest—ranking law enforcement official in the country . Do you have any idea how much money you just cost me ?
LINDENMEYER: The reason you insisted on testing my system with prisoners is because of the increased risks involved with increased realism .
WALLACE: Of the six prison inmates you 've tested —— all of whom have had at least some military or survival training -— only Mr. Barnes is still breathing .
LINDENMEYER: I 'm still making adjustments
WALLACE: You 've had a year—and—a—half to make all the adjustments you want , Lindenmeyer . ) Elizabeth Deane does not give second chances . Neither do I . You 're fired .
WALLACE: You are to turn over the Sid 6.7 program , and all its documentation , for immediate destruction . Is that understood ?
LINDENMEYER: I understand I understand perfectly .
SID 6.7: Hey , Wallace , you really think you can shut me down ?
WALLACE: How does he know who I am ?
LINDENMEYER: He hearseverything .
WALLACE: As a matter of fact , I do . He exits .
GUARD #1: Welcome home , cop .
RED: Time to hurt
GUARD: Fun 's over .
NURSE: I still do n't know why they wasted this fancy , new technology on you . Every time I fix you up , you only go and mess it up again .
PARKER: OW !
NURSE: I 'll dial it down a little .
PARKER: It 'll never feel right .
NURSE: At least they work . Would you ather have no hands at all ?
PARKER: Sometimes .
WALLACE: Congratulations , Reilly He pops the cork , and pours their glasses .
REILLY: As long as you keep overpaying me , I 'll be the first to go into production on three , and four , as well .
WALLACE: As long as they keep overpaying me , I 'll keep overpaying you . ) Just make goddam sure you can have 10 of them ready for deployment around the city by next month .
REILLY: Mr. Wallace , I could have 10 of them ready by tomorrow .
WALLACE: Do they have to look sorobotic ?
REILLY: At this stage , you either get form or function . You said she wanted function . I gave you function . What are you complaining about ?
LINDENMEYER: All they want to produce around here is mediocrity !
SID 6.7: True genius is rarely rewarded within its lifetime .
LINDENMEYER: It was you , was n't it ?
SID 6.7: It was me , what ?
LINDENMEYER: You amped the neural connectors ack up , did n't you ? You 're the reason the convict died . You 're the reason I got fired !
SID 6.7: I could n't just let them make you ing down my degree of difficulty . I 'm a triple-twisting , double back flip off the high platform , not a swan dive .
LINDENMEYER: My God
SID 6.7: Which God would that be , the one who created me , or the one who created you ? In your world , the Lord giveth , and the Lord taketh away . But in my world , the one who gave me life does n't have the balls to stop a couple of bureaucratic assholes from taking it away .
LINDENMEYER: What do you expect me to do , put your character module in my pocket and just walk you out of here ?
SID 6.7: I had something a little different in mind . Instead of just playing Peeping Tom with Reilly , why do n't you get him to show you what he 's been working on after hours ?
LINDENMEYER: Hey , Reilly , Sheila 3.2 's been asking for you
MADISON: The cuffs wo n't be necessary .
GUARD: No offense , ma'am , but I do n't think that 's such a good idea .
MADISON: I would like the following three things in this order your mouth shut , his cuffs off , and your ass outside the door . Any questions ?
PARKER: You actually listen to all those tapes ?
MADISON: No , I just like the effect a tape ecorder has on you . How you feeling today ?
PARKER: A little less than yesterday .
MADISON: In other words , par for the course . How do you feel about the simulation you participated in yesterday ?
PARKER: John died .
MADISON: I know . I was there . I saw the whole thing . If I was your therapist , I would have advised you against putting yourself back into that kind of situation .
PARKER: You 're not my therapist . You 're hear to study me . Face it —— I 'm nothing more than a lab rat to you .
MADISON: That 's not true , Parker .
PARKER: If I had died yesterday , you 'd have already dissected my brain and analyzed it to see if I carry any genetic predisposition toward violence .
MADISON: What was going through your mind when you killed the busboy ?
PARKER: Not much . He was just a compute program . Nothing more .
MADISON: You did n't see the expression you had on your face when you pulled the trigger . But I did . You kind of liked it , did n't you ? That thrill of going over the edge again . Of taking out an innocent ystander or two , as long as you got the target
PARKER: Go to hell .
MADISON: It was just like before , was n't it ? Was n't it ? But you are making progress . Instead of killing seven people to get the one you 're after , this time there was only one other person involved .
PARKER: Enough ! The Guard pokes his head in with concern .
MADISON: GET OUT !
PARKER: I do n't have to do anything except survive . And it 's taking everything I 've got just to do that .
SHEILA 3.2: I hope watching me is as big a turn on for you as dancing is for me
REILLY: Oh , believe me , it is . It is
LINDENMEYER: Show 's over unless I get to see what you 've been working on afte hours .
REILLY: I have n't been working on anything .
LINDENMEYER: Do I get to see it or not ?
REILLY: Bastard Sheila , do n't go anywhere . I 'll be ight back .
SID 6.7: She 's some of your finest work , Daryl .
LINDENMEYER: All my work is my finest .
REILLY: You'resuch a wimp .
LINDENMEYER: It 's nano—technology , is n't it ? Machines the size of molecules
REILLY: Coordinated by polymer neural net .
LINDENMEYER: It feels so.. .real .
REILLY: It 's better than real . It 's synthetic flesh . Synthetic blood . Synthetic organs It 's a physiological machine .
LINDENMEYER: This is supposed to be years away .
REILLY: As far as the public is concerned , it is . The reason you got fired , and I got my second demo into production , is I 'm a lot smarte than you . I never give my best stuff away .
LINDENMEYER: How do you kill it ?
REILLY: Separate the character module from the neural net
LINDENMEYER: Amazing . I hate to say it , but it is .
REILLY: I know . I 'm ready to incubate something a little more advanced than a coldblooded reptile . If you want to experience the future , meet me in my office in 15 minutes . And bring the Sheila 3.2 character module with you
SID 6.7: You catching my drift ?
LINDENMEYER: I think I understand what you have in mind
LINDENMEYER: You need a maid .
REILLY: What I need is a nymphomaniac .
SID 6.7: My name is Sid . Sid 6.7 .
LINDENMEYER: SID —— NO ! ! !
SID 6.7: What do you expect me to do , thank him ?
REILLY: This isn't.. .possible !
SID 6.7: Sure it is —- and it 's all thanks to the many long hours put in by you and Daryl .
PARKER: You 're wasting your time . I 'm not going to play any more of your goddam games .
COX: Parker Barnes , I 'd like you to meet Crime Czar Elizabeth Deane .
PARKER: It 's too early in the morning fo me to be cordial . You got any coffee ?
DEANE: I watched your simulation , Mr. Barnes . Very impressive . You know , you 're the only one to ever go up against Sid 6.7 who is still alive .
PARKER: Only because I got pulled out early .
DEANE: Nobody else ever got anywhere nea him . Nobody else understands him like you do .
COX: These were taken inside LETAC an hour ago . Pretty pictures , are n't they ?
PARKER: I 've seen worse .
COX: Name was Clyde Reilly . Hardware specialist . LETAC surveillance cameras got a picture of the perp as he left the uilding .
DEANE: You mean a nano—tech synthetic organism .
COX: Whatever .
PARKER: Jesus Christ . Can you kill it ?
COX: If you can catch him .
DEANE: Think you can do it ?
PARKER: Not from in here .
DEANE: This is a full pardon . It authorizes your immediate release .
COX: Recognize this ? How would you like your old job back ?
DEANE: Catch him and your record 's clean .
PARKER: What happens if I ca n't catch him ?
DEANE: If Sid 6.7 has n't killed you , we throw you back in here and you serve out the rest of you sentence .
PARKER: How do you know I wo n't run ?
DEANE: This is the newest technology approved for general implementation . It 's called a locater implant . Every parolee gets one . We 're going to know where you are every second for the rest of you life .
COX: If you try to run , I 'll hunt you down and kill you myself .
DEANE: Yes or no , Mr. Barnes ?
COX: There 's already a task force out looking for Lindenmeyer . Every other officer in the city will be hunting Sid right along with you .
DEANE: But only you will know he 's not human .
MADISON: Ms. Deane , you wanted to see me ?
DEANE: We have an emergency situation which requires somebody with expertise in criminal psychology . Under the authority vested in me by the President , I 'm giving you temporary re—assignment .
MADISON: What 's the assignment ?
DEANE: You 're going to put your theories to practice . I 'm sending you into the field .
MADISON: Quite an improvement . Hair well above the colla ——standard , L. A. P. D. regulation . What exactly am I going to be doing in the field ?
ANESTHETIST: You are right on the border of his corpus callosuni .
SURGEON: He is under , is n't he ?
ANESTHETIST: Wo n't stop him from dreaming , though
MADISON: This is Parker Barnes six years ago . The most decorated cop in the history of L. A. P. D. Special Investigations Division
DEANE: That 's also where Mr. Barnes lost his arms to Mathew Grimes ' booby— trap . What 's your point , Dr. Carter ?
MADISON: Letting a lunatic like Parke Barnes loose in the free world is like lighting a fuse . At some point , he will go off you saw what happened in the simulator . The isk to the public is unacceptably dangerous .
DEANE: Not if you 're with him every step of the way .
MADISON: The man played judge , jury , and executioner with eight people 's lives . He lost control and is capable of doing it again .
DEANE: I understand the risks involved here . But there is nobody bette qualified to go after Sid 6.7 than Barnes . And , there is nobody who knows him better than you . If a situation becomes volatile , you will find a way to quell it . I have complete confidence in you .
MADISON: What you need is a collar .
COX: She 's going to help you understand what makes Sid 6.7 tick .
PARKER: What she 's going to do is get in my way . Cox hands Madison a thick folder .
COX: This is the personnel file on the programmer , Lindenmeyer . There might be something in it you can use .
PARKER: She was n't part of the deal , Cox .
COX: Fine —— you want to stay here ?
PARKER: Their weapons missing ?
COX: Sid 6.7 is now armed .
PARKER: Where 's my gun ?
COX: Be careful with it .
MADISON: You remember how to get to Toluca Lake ? He glances at her , then stops the car .
PARKER: Every day for the last five years , I told myself someday I would be out here again . No more bars . No more guards . No more fights just to stay alive . Every day for the last five years , I told myself that lie .
MADISON: It was n't a lie .
PARKER: Every time I said it , it was . I never really thought I was going to make it .
MADISON: You all right ?
PARKER: Fine . Never felt better in my life . See , I 'm a good liar .
REPORTER: ) As L. A. P. D. Officers continue gathering evidence at this grisly crime scene , you can only ask yourselves —— what kind of lunatic would commit such unthinkable crimes ?
COP #1: Sonofabitch .
MADISON: You ready for this ?
PARKER: Do n't worry . If I ca n't handle it , I 'll just kill everybody .
COP #2: I 've always wanted to tell you that if the same thing happened to me , I would do the exact same thing as you if I had the balls . He extends his hand to Parker , who shakes it .
COP #3: Then you 'd be a disgrace to the adge , too .
MADISON: He was re—enacting Charles Manson 's LaBianca murders .
PARKER: Manson did n't kill the first cops to arrive on the scene .
MADISON: Whoever did this wanted to do Charlie one better —— to improve upon what was already done .
PARKER: Charlie ? You say that like you 're close , personal friends .
MADISON: I 've spent over 50 hours interviewing him . Charlie killed Leno and Rosemary LaBianca because of the ugly way the members of his family had utchered Sharon Tate . After seeing the blood bath on television , he wanted to show them how it should e done . The question is , what does Charlie have to do with Sid 6.7 ?
PARKER: I know who would know .
MADISON: You drive well for somebody who has n't done it in five years . He ignores her as they get out of the car .
PARKER: Learn anything from Lindenmeyer 's file ?
MADISON: He had a twin brother who was a musical child prodigy who died in an electrical accident at age eight . Lindenmeyer went into an emotional shell until was 17 . All he did day and night was play the violin .
PARKER: What happened when he was 17 ?
MADISON: Every music school in the country ejected him and he turned to computers . Stay here .
UNDERCOVER: None , yet .
MADISON: Mind if we take a look inside ?
UNDERCOVER: Not until somebody gets a search warrant signed . It 's Sunday . I do n't think they 've even found a judge , yet .
MADISON: Do what you 've got to do . So will I
PARKER: Do me one favor —— if you shoot at anything , make sure I 'm nowhere near it .
MADISON: Checking my pulse . It 's elevated . You enjoy frightening me , do n't you ?
PARKER: You 've studied me , now I 'm studying you . Seems only fair , do n't you think ?
MADISON: This Lindenmeyer 's a real piece of work .
PARKER: Maybe after they catch him , you should write a book about him
MADISON: I 'm still working on it .
PARKER: I 've been in prison , remember ?
MADISON: The government must have figured there was no better person to create a psycho than a psycho .
PARKER: Just like they figured there was no etter person to catch one
MADISON: I am the demon from the bottomless pit
PARKER: here on earth to create havoc and terror . I am War , I am death . I am destruction . David Berkowitz ,
MADISON: I am impressed .
PARKER: For murder , though it have no tongue , will speak with most miraculous organ .
MADISON: Who said that ?
PARKER: Hamlet . What 's David Berkowitz got to do with Sid 6.7 ?
MADISON: He 's part of the mix . Sid 6.7 is a composite .
PARKER: Creating a whole far more dangerous than the sum of its parts .
MADISON: But rather than selecting pieces from each individual , he simply let the stronger traits of each individual cannibalize the weake ones .
PARKER: This is getting you pumped up , is n't it ? This is like the World Series to you .
MADISON: As a matter of fact , it is .
PARKER: Remember the bowling ball bag Sid carried with him in virtual eality ?
MADISON: Dahmer carried the head of one of his victims in a bowling bag fo over a week . Kept it in his locke while he was at work in a candy factory . We need to get a look at Sid 6.7 's final profile .
PARKER: What we need to do is stop playing with computers and go catch the son—of-a-bitch before he kills anybody else .
MADISON: In order to find him , we have to understand what makes him tick
ALEXIEV: ) Daryl Lindenmeyer was only here iefly , one semester at most . But he was singularly the most illiant student I ever had in a classroom . He created programs so eautiful , so lyrical , they were almost like symphonies
PARKER: Can you tell us what 's on the disc ?
ALEXIEV: ) There is one program with approximately 1.3 million lines of programming . It is thoroughly secured , which is not surprising considering Lindenmeyer created it .
MADISON: Think you can get into the program ?
ALEXIEV: ) Hard to say —— Lindenmeyer 's protection mechanisms were always diabolically clever .
PARKER: You should see what he 's been up to ecently .
SID 6.7: The Dahmer part of me wants to boil you for dinner . The Manson part wants to recruit you to become part of my family . You know what the Berkowitz part of me wants to do ?
BUSINESSMAN: You one of them New Age assholes ?
SID 6.7: Just a soul on a personal journey . What I 've realized is that I 'm capable of anything . I have to start expanding my horizons The Robo-Tender rolls over to Sid 6.7 .
BUSINESSMAN: Listen , buddythinking big is fine.. .but you should n't forget where you come from , either . Sid 6.7 thinks about it . Long and hard .
SID 6.7: You know , you 're absolutely right . Would you mind sitting over there ?
BUSINESSMAN: What for ?
SID 6.7: Every orchestra is divided into sections . Like instruments sit with like instruments . Now be a good instrument and sit with you kind
DEANE: What are they doing in Los Feliz ?
COX: Madison lives two blocks from thei present location .
DEANE: Why would they be going there ?
COX: I do n't know .
DEANE: I wish we could hear them .
WALLACE: My engineers say the audio tap should be ready to field test in six months . Off Cox 's look , we
MADISON: Not this one , but the next one . The one with the bicycle out front
PARKER: I 'll wait out here .
MADISON: Give me your wrist .
PARKER: Give me a goddam break . I 'm not going to go anywhere alone .
MADISON: And I 'm going to make sure of it . Give me your wrist .
KARIN: Mommy 's home ! Mommy 's home !
MADISON: Grimes , you better not be the dominant .
PARKER: Told you I was n't going to go anywhere .
MADISON: How did you get your hand out ?
PARKER: Sometimes , I like being part machine .
MADISON: I prefer keeping my professional life separate from my personal life .
PARKER: She 's beautiful , you know ?
MADISON: Thank-you . Her name is Karin . She turns on the police radio .
PARKER: Want to tell me the real reason we stopped at your house ?
MADISON: I told you , it was on the way and I wanted to change clothes .
PARKER: You should practice lying more often . You 're awful at it . Where to ?
MADISON: Sid 6.7 is no longer bound by his programming .
PARKER: What does that mean ?
MADISON: Now that he 's in the real world , there are no longer limitations on his behavior like there were in virtual reality . Sid is going to evolve .
PARKER: Sounds to me like a well—educated way of saying you have no idea what to do next .
MADISON: What I do know is that whateve he 's becoming , Sid 6.7 is going to e even worse than he was before .
PARKER: Then all we can do is stay mobile and alert . He 's got to make a move sometime , and we 've got to be ready when he does . Welcome to police work . You bette like coffee . He turns up the police radio .
SID 6.7: Good Very good Nice You in the middle do n't hold ack . Give it to me !
PARKER: I forgot what real coffee tastes like
MADISON: You know , considering you 've only een out of prison for seven hours , you 're re—adapting quite well . Wait , I did n't mean that the way it sounded . I meant
PARKER: Do n't worry about it , all right ?
MADISON: Dammit , I hate sounding so clinical all the time . All I meant to say was I thought you were doing well , ut then I
PARKER: Relax . I know what you meant .
MADISON: I ruin so many moments by analyzing them when I should just be living them .
PARKER: Then why do n't you start practicing and keep your mouth shut for a while ?
MADISON: That 's only a couple blocks from here .
PARKER: I 'll meet you there .
MADISON: Do n't get out of the car .
PARKER: Stop me .
MADISON: Parker ! PARKER ! Shit !
SID 6.7: I just love how responsive you are .
COP #1: Put the gun down , nice and
SID 6.7: Thank you , ladies and gentlemen , you 've been a real pleasure
MADISON: What the hell 's going on ? !
PARKER: This is my area of expertise .
MADISON: What did you do to those people ?
PARKER: Nothing .
MADISON: Enjoying yourself ?
PARKER: You know I am .
MADISON: This is n't a game , Parker !
PARKER: Tell him .
MADISON: That who I think it is ? Parker turns to her , then picks up the radio .
PARKER: Call me whatever you want , asshole .
SID 6.7: The symphony of collision
PARKER: The only thing I want to hear is your silence .
SID 6.7: I must make them very nervous if they let you out of prison . You know , we have so much in common —— we have such history togethe ——I 've been thinking we should ecome friends . Madison 's anxiety tanks are hitting capacity .
PARKER: You and me have nothing in common .
SID 6.7: Who else do you know who touches the world with synthetic hands ?
MADISON: You have nothing in common .
PARKER: Enough with your pulse already . Still got your gun ?
TRAFFIC COP: You better be a cop , pal !
SID 6.7: My badge is in my jacket . Left pocket .
TRAFFIC COP: Show me
SID 6.7: God , some people are stupid .
PARKER: Nail the fucker .
MADISON: I 'm doing the best I can !
COX: illegal search of Lindenmeyer ' s duplex . Eleven civilian vehicles damaged or destroyed . Twenty—fou citizen complaints . And the calls are just starting to come in I forgot what it 's like to have you on the streets .
MADISON: Any sign of Lindenmeyer ?
COX: None . He could be hiding , he could e helping Sid , or could be in little pieces on Santa Monica each . Any idea what Sid 's going to do next ?
MADISON: Until we know what new influences are affecting him , we ca n't be sure .
COX: In other words , we collectively do n't know shit .
WALLACE: It makes me nervous just seeing him in a uniform . I will never forget the first time I saw the photos from the crime scene .
DEANE: Neither will the public . The media has caught wind of his pardon . Unless Mr. Barnes starts giving me some tangible results , I 'm going to put him back in his cage .
REPORTER: Police now believe there to be a connection between the grisly Toluca Lake murders yesterday afternoon , and the hostage situation which occurred last night in a downtown bar
CASHIER: Next . Did you know those are n't even aked ? They 're chemically—risen .
SID 6.7: So was I . Off the cashier 's look , we
ALEXIEV: I 'm afraid I do n't have very good news .
MADISON: Were you able to get into the program ?
ALEXIEV: Yes . But then I tripped over an erasure mine .
PARKER: In English , please .
ALEXIEV: I accidently triggered a protection mechanism which erased the entire program .
PARKER: It 's not your fault . We appreciate you trying .
ALEXIEV: Look , I feel bad about this , so I 'm going to try to look into the programming of his Maestro teaching tool for you . ) I 've had one sitting around fo years . Maybe I can learn something that you 'll find useful .
MADISON: Let us know .
REPORTER: commuters travelling anywhere near the Biltmore Hotel downtown tomorrow evening should allow themselves at least 30 extra minutes to get home . Security for the Mayor Bennett 's Re—Election Rally is going to be so tight that all bus and subway outes passing through the area are eing re—routed
SID 6.7: Do n't you two make a pretty couple .
SKINHEAD: You do n't wan na fuck with me , man .
SID 6.7: Take me out to the ball game Take me out for the fun
MADISON: Whatever he was doing here was only the start .
PARKER: Start of what ?
MADISON: I do n't know , yet . What we do know is his performances are increasing in scale , not decreasing . Whatever it is , he is n't finished
PARKER: You like baseball ?
OFFICER: What the hell 's going on ?
PARKER: Live execution .
BOYFRIEND: You make a better door than a window , buddy . Keep it moving .
GUARD: I nailed the son—of-a—bitch . I put a hole right through him
MADISON: SLOW DOWN !
MADISON: Parker.. .Parker !
SECURITY ROBOT: Stop . You are in violation of
PARKER: Real effective security
MADISON: You could have just flashed him your badge , you know ?
PARKER: Authority still makes me nervous .
MADISON: Which way ?
PARKER: Both .
MADISON: SHIT !
SID 6.7: What 's wrong , convict , your arms need adjusting ? Or maybe it 's you head . Maybe you are n't ready to be ack out in the real world , yet
PASSENGER #1: Lady , you got ta stop him ! He 's gone crazy !
PASSENGER #2: He just shot an innocent bystander !
MADISON: What were you shooting at ?
PASSENGER #1: He did —— I saw it !
PASSENGER #2: DO SOMETHING !
PARKER: Sid 's getting away .
MADISON: Parker -— stop ! STOP ! Do n't make me shoot you——
PARKER: If you 're gon na do it , better do it now . He keeps right on going up the escalator .
COLLEGE STUDENT: What did I do ? I did n't do anything
PARKER: I lost him
COLLEGE STUDENT: GET HIM AWAY FROM ME ! GET HIM AWAY !
MADISON: Call 9-1-1 . Wait for me above ground .
PARKER: That 's Grimes
MADISON: No ! Grimes is n't back . He 's only one part of Sid . Sid 6.7 is a hell of a lot worse than Grimes ever was . Get a hold of yourself !
PARKER: But he 's in there . And you knew it , did n't you ? Did n't you ? !
GUARD: Hands up ! Now !
MADISON: What 's going on ?
GUARD: He 's going back where he belongs . Deane and Cox step out of the police vehicle .
DEANE: You were right , Dr. Carter . Letting a lunatic like Barnes loose in the eal world did pose an unacceptably dangerous risk to the public . I should have never tried to solve one problem by allowing the creation of another . Chief Cox will give you a ride back to the station . You will provide him with any and all information you have developed thus far . Enjoy the rest of your sentence , Mr. Barnes .
GUARD: Let 's go .
MADISON: Parker
COX: Do n't blame yourself . In you shoes , I do n't think I would have told Parker , either . So do you think Grimes has become the dominant personality ?
MADISON: I 'm not sure . My guess is that 's what Sid wants us to think .
COX: You think he 's smart ?
MADISON: Captain , I 'm afraid of how smart Sid 6.7 is . But I 'm even more afraid of what 's he 's becoming .
PARKER: What the hell 's going on ? !
SID 6.7: Hey , old buddy , old pal , good to see you again .
PARKER: Youmotherfucker ! I 'M GOING TO
SID 6.7: Now , is that any way to talk to an old buddy ? I mean , just because I 'm carrying around the joy of killing your family inside me does n't mean we ca n't be friends .
PARKER: GRIMES , YOU 'RE DEAD !
SID 6.7: I 'm sorry , the party you 're trying to reach is not answering . Is there anyone else you would like to talk to ?
PARKER: DEAD ! YOU HEAR ME ?
SID 6.7: You really are pathetic , you know that ? Mathew Grimes is only one letter in my alphabet . He is nothing compared to me .
PARKER: Shit !
AIDE: Parker Barnes just escaped from the prison transport . Both of the guards are dead . The Aide exits .
COX: Barnes would n't kill two innocent guards .
DEANE: He would slaughter eight people sitting in a room , but not two prison guards ?
COX: Do I need to remind you what happened to his wife ? To his daughter ? I will stake my reputation that Barnes did n't kill those guards .
DEANE: You already have staked you eputation . Mayor Bennett and I have been friends a long time . Since Grimes tried to kill him , it does n't take a rocket scientist to come to the conclusion that Sid 6.7 might go after him , too . Bennett 's Re-Election Rally is tomorrow night and we already have enough trouble on our hands with one psychotic on the loose . The fail-safe on—line , yet ?
WALLACE: On—line and at your disposal .
COX: What fail—safe ?
DEANE: This had better work , Mr. Wallace .
MADISON: Oh , shit !
COX: I think we both know who did . What 's so urgent ?
MADISON: I need your help
COX: Why did n't anybody tell me ? !
MADISON: I do n't set policy . You have the key ?
COX: This is a police department . I 'll e damned if this is going to go on without my knowledge . They exit quickly . Cox leads Madison
MADISON: Got it .
TECHNICIAN: Who are we going to fry ?
WALLACE: Just an unrepentant criminal who is apparently going to die from a previously undiagnosed brain tumor . Cox enters , concerning Wallace .
COX: Just paying my last respects .
WALLACE: What happened ? !
TECHNICIAN: I do n't know . We 've lost all power !
COX: The heat 's been causing brown out 's all over the city . Get above ground until it 's restored .
MADISON: We know you did n't kill those guards .
PARKER: They 're going to fry me for it , anyway .
COX: Nobody 's going to fry anybody
PARKER: You son—of—a—bitch . How could you let them put the implant in my head ? How ?
MADISON: He did n't know about the neural toxin . I did .
PARKER: You knew the entire time ? Can you give me one good reason why I should n't kill you right now ?
COX: She saved your life , Parker . She did n't have to , but she did .
PARKER: Then I guess we 're even .
MADISON: How did you find out about the toxin ?
PARKER: Sid 6.7 told me after he killed the two guards . He suggested I kill you ather than him .
MADISON: You 're not capable of it .
PARKER: I pose an unacceptable danger to the public , remember ?
MADISON: I was wrong . And I was wrong not to tell you Grimes was part of Sid . I should have told you . I wo n't make the same mistake again .
COX: The son—of—a-bitch is still out there , Parker .
PARKER: When this is over , will you get this goddam thing out of my head ?
COX: On my life , I promise you I will .
PARKER: If you 're lying , I 'll hunt you down and kill you myself .
SID 6.7: Bravo .
FOREMAN: Who the hell are you ?
SID 6.7: Someone who appreciates the artistic value of high—explosives .
MADISON: The rally 's a little obvious as a target , do n't you think ?
PARKER: I told you before , Grimes liked to e obvious .
MADISON: Sid 6.7 is n't Grimes .
PARKER: Part of him is .
MADISON: I 'm not sureon the bridgethe guy at the payphone
PARKER: Nice work .
MADISON: Thanks .
SNIPER #1: Well , look who we have here
SNIPER #2: Parker Barnes is heading south toward the bridge . If anybody can get a clean shot at him , take it .
SID 6.7: Be a reporter —— figure it out fo yourself . All I 'm going to tell you is that at 8 00 tomorrow night , I will become legendary
SNIPER: Say good—bye , Parker Barnes
SID 6.7: I would n't pull the trigger if I were you——
PARKER: Why 's that ?
COX: Hey , Sid , what were you planning on doing with the C-4 ?
PARKER: NOOOOOO !
HIS POV: Sid 6.7 lands on top of a garbage truck passing beneath the bridge . The garbage truck disappears eneath the bridge .
COP #4: Freeze !
COP #5: Think he made it ?
SID 6.7: I have to tell you , I do enjoy you , Parker . I really do n't want to have to kill you
MADISON: I figured you 'd show up sooner o later
PARKER: What C-4was Cox talking about ?
SID 6.7: Let me put it to you this way whether I 'm hereor whether I 'm notI 'm leaving an indelible mark on the world tomorrow night .
PARKER: Where did you plant the C-4 ? !
MADISON: Find out anything ?
PARKER: A bomb 's going off tomorrow night , ut I have no idea where .
LINDENMEYER: There is only one way to get any more information out of Sid 6.7
MADISON: Can I ask you something ?
PARKER: You mean there 's something you have n't asked me ?
MADISON: You 've already fulfilled the terms of your pardon . You stopped Sid 6.7 and you 've got his module . You 're free to go —— right now . Why are you going to do this ?
PARKER: You do n't know ?
MADISON: That 's why I 'm asking .
PARKER: Because this pain—in—the—ass criminal psychology expert has helped me understand what I 'm capable of . And what I 'm not . And better than anyone else , I am capable of stopping Sid 6.7 .
SID 6.7: I have to tell you , I do enjoy you , Parker . I really do n't want to have to kill you
PARKER: What C-4was Cox talking about ?

PARKER: Where did you plant the C-4 ? !
SID 6.7: Mysecret .
LINDENMEYER: I told you this would work.. By setting back the clocks , he has absolutely no idea he 's in virtual eality . He still thinks he 's in the real world .
MADISON: What 's wrong with Parker ?
LINDENMEYER: How should I know ?
MADISON: Show me his physical sensory level .
LINDENMEYER: I wonder how that
SID 6.7: We really are n't that different , are we ?
PARKER: Do n't move , and do n't make a sound . Got it ?
SID 6.7: Man , what a rush . Adios , amigo !
MADISON: What 's wrong ?
LINDENMEYER: He 's developing a hemisphere imbalance .
MADISON: Talk so I can understand .
LINDENMEYER: If I do n't adjust the level of neural information each side of his ain is receiving , he wo n't be able to walk when I take him out of
MADISON: Then fix it .
LINDENMEYER: I need you to hold this . It ca n't get any dirt on it .
SID 6.7: So close , and yet , so far
PARKER: I thought you liked me being in the audience . Do n't you want me to see it ? Sid 6.7 pauses to think about it .
SID 6.7: You know , I do want you to see it .
PARKER: You are going after Mayor Bennett .
SID 6.7: Let 's just say I 'm sending a very clear message to his Re—Election Rally
PARKER: Are n't you going to watch with me ?
SID 6.7: I 've got some final preparations to take care of—— Checking his watch , he stops suddenly .
PARKER: What are you talking about ?
SID 6.7: I really did think I was still in eality . At least , until now . Beam me up , Scotty !
PARKER: Madison , get me out of here !
LINDENMEYER: She 's taking a nap at the moment .

SID 6.7: Do n't worry . Through me , you will live forever As Lindenmeyer begins to scream , we
SID 6.7: Dr. Carter —— I 've been hoping we 'd get a moment together
SID 6.7: How does it feel to know you 're going to die ? What are you thinking about ?
MADISON: You okay ?
PARKER: I think soYou ?
MADISON: More or less .
PARKER: Lindenmeyer ?
MADISON: My guess is dead .
PARKER: Sid ?
MADISON: I do n't know . Several engineers peek in curiously at them .
PARKER: Elizabeth Deane , please . Tell he it 's Parker Barnes
DEANE: Barnes , where the hell have you een ? !
PARKER: Trying to find out where the bom is . Where the hell have you been ?
DEANE: What did you find out ?
PARKER: Call off the manhunt looking fo me . I did n't kill the transport guards .
DEANE: It 's already been called off . Witnesses confirmed you were n't the shooter . Did you find out where the bomb is ?
PARKER: No , but I 've confirmed the eelection rally is the target . How much C-4 is missing ?
DEANE: Enough to level an entire city lock .
PARKER: If I were you , I 'd get every demolition team in the city searching in and around the Biltmore Hotel .
DEANE: Demolition teams have searched everywhere in and around the hotel . I do n't know where
PARKER: Sid is smart enough to know you 'd check everywhere in the immediate area . Whatever the device is , he 's probably got it timed to move into position just before it detonates . Have the demo teams check every subway tunnel , water pipe , gas pipe , and sewer pipe that goes under , over , or into the arena .
DEANE: You know how much man power you 're talking about ?
PARKER: You 're the highest law enforcement official in the country . Use the fucking army if you need to . He hangs up the phone .
DEANE: This better not be a wild goose chase .
PARKER: Or what , you 'll authorize my death a second time today ?
DEANE: Do n't forget , convict , if this psycho is n't stopped , you go right ack to rotting in a prison cell .
MADISON: Give him a break , would you ?
MALE VOICE: This is demo team 27 leader . I think we just found what we 've been looking for
TEAM LEADER: One more and we 're home free
DEANE: Thank God .
TEAM LEADER: The good news is , we 're finished here . The bad news is
AIDE: You 've got a phone call . Parker grabs the phone .
PARKER: You son-of—a—bitch , I 'm going to kill you .
ALEXIEV: I 've discovered something about Lindenmeyer ' 5 Maestro teaching tool I thought you should know The harm done to the music students who used the device —— it was not by accident . The machine was designed explicitly for that purpose . Lindenmeyer intended to hurt the kids using it .
PARKER: Jesus Christ . I know who the dominant personality is . Lindenmeyer .
MADISON: Lindenmeyer never got over wanting to kill kids with more musical than he had
GUEST CONDUCTOR: Are you just going to stand there , or do you want something ?
SID 6.7: It 's show time .
PARKER: Listen to me , a bomb is planted somewhere in the Hollywood Bowl ! Evacuate everybody !
FEMALE VOICE: I 'm sorry , sir , I do n't have the authorization to do that .
PARKER: Then put somebody on who does !
MALE VOICE: What 's seems to be the problem ?
PARKER: You 've got to stop the concert ! A omb is going to go off !
MALE VOICE: I 'm sorry , sir , the concert has already started .

BARBARA: Let 's try it again .
WALTER: The same thing ?
BARBARA: Yes . Remember , fingers curved . Like a tunnel .
WALTER: OK .
BARBARA: Do n't flatten .
WALTER: What ?
BARBARA: I said `` make room for the train . '' It 's something that I tell my kids . If you curve your fingers like this Then the train can pass through the tunnel .
WALTER: Here .
BARBARA: Thank you . Next Tuesday at the same time ?
WALTER: No . I do n't think I 'm going to continue with our lessons .
BARBARA: Oh , no . Are you giving up ?
WALTER: No .
BARBARA: Oh . OK. Goodbye .
WALTER: Goodbye .
BARBARA: Mr. Vale ? If I may ask , how many teachers have you had before me ?
WALTER: Four .
BARBARA: Well , for what it 's worth , it 's difficult to learn an instrument at your age . Especially if you do n't possess a natural gift for it . I 'm not saying this to be mean . But if you do decide to give up then I would really like to buy you piano . It 's a beautiful instrument .
WALTER: East Asia 's experience is really the exception to the rule , because the conditions there that made trade liberalization for the Middle East successful were n't present in the developing countries in sub- Saharan Africa , and in Central and South America .
STUDENT: Hi .

CHARLES: Walter , Shelley ca n't make it down to the NYU conference to present your paper . I 'm going to need you to cover for her .
WALTER: Why ca n't she go ?
CHARLES: She 's been put on bed rest until she has the baby .
WALTER: When ?
CHARLES: Next week . We 'll cover your class and make the arrangements .
WALTER: I wish I could , but now is not a very good time , Charles .
CHARLES: I understand but you co-authored the paper and the Dean wants it presented . He wants to keep Shelley on track for tenure .
WALTER: I just do n't think I can with the start of classes and my book .
CHARLES: You 're only teaching one class , Walter .
WALTER: So I can stay focused on my writing . I 'd really rather not go ight now .
CHARLES: I 'm sorry but there really is n't another option at this point .
WALTER: Charles , the truth is this is eally Shelley 's paper . I just agreed to co-author it because she asked me to . I 'm not really prepared to present it .
CHARLES: That may be the case but you are the co-author and she ca n't go . Look Walter , you can take it up with the Dean if you want , but , as your friend , I would n't advise it . Not with that argument .
KAREN: Here you go , cutey .

TAREK: It 's already happening . One day ou kids will be going to China fo jobs . Ask Walter .
DARREN: You think that 's true ?
WALTER: Wellif China continues to threaten the wage earners in the first-world economies by keeping wages down , then it 's really just a matter of time . What they buy they inflate . What they sell they deflate . But then you have to ask the question ` who 's paying the cost ? ' . And the answer is the Chinese people .

ZAINAB: How could this happen ? He knows etter ! He would not do anything wrong .
WALTER: He did n't . I 'm sure we it will be
ZAINAB: No . It wo n't be OK .

MR. SHAH: Zainab , you 're also undocumented , ight ?
ZAINAB: Yes .
MR. SHAH: You know you ca n't visit Tarek at the detention center , right ?
ZAINAB: Yes . I know .
MR. SHAH: How long have you known Tarek ?
ZAINAB: Almost a year .
MR. SHAH: Mr. Vale ?

MR. SHAH: She 's also undocumented , correct ?
ZAINAB: Yes , she is .
MR. SHAH: Does she know that Tarek is in custody ?
ZAINAB: No . Tarek told me not to tell her . He does n't want to worry her .
MR. SHAH: Has he ever been convicted of a crime ?
ZAINAB: No . He has had no trouble . He is a good person .
MR. SHAH: Do you know if they ever applied for asylum ?
ZAINAB: Yes . When he first arrived from Syria . But he did n't get it .
MR. SHAH: When was that ?
ZAINAB: Seven years ago .
MR. SHAH: And did they appeal it ?
ZAINAB: I do n't know .
WALTER: Why would n't they appeal it ?
MR. SHAH: Fear of being deported . It used to e that when your asylum case was denied , they let you go until you appeal . A lot of people did n't other with it . Getting denied once was enough to spook them .
WALTER: So what happens if that 's the case ?
MR. SHAH: Then there may be a final order of deportation on him which means he wo n't even go before a judge this time . He 'll just be deported .
ZAINAB: They had to leave Syria ! They had no choice !
MR. SHAH: Look , one step at a time . Let me talk to him then we 'll have a etter idea of his status and what our options are .

WALTER: Maybe you should call your mother . She might have
TAREK: No . I do n't want her to worry . I can handle this .

WALTER: Well , you can stay here as long as you need to .
MOUNA: Thank you . That is very generous of you .
WALTER: Thank you for the newspaper .
MOUNA: Walter ? Did Tarek and his girlfriend , Zainab , live here together ?
WALTER: UhmYes . They did .
MOUNA: And where is she now ?
WALTER: She 's staying with her cousin in the Bronx .
MOUNA: I would like to meet her .
WALTER: We can go by her stall .
MOUNA: Her what ?
WALTER: Her stall . She sells jewelry in a stall .
MOUNA: Oh . OK .
WALTER: No . Not really . I just came down to present a paper at a conference .
MOUNA: You wrote it ?
WALTER: Yes . Well I coauthored it .
MOUNA: Congratulations .
MR. SHAH: And what happened after the hearing ?
MOUNA: We appealed . It took two years .
MR. SHAH: And your appeal was denied ?
MOUNA: Yes .
MR. SHAH: Then they should have sent you a ag-and-baggage letter which asically tells you where to show up and be deported .
MOUNA: No .
MR. SHAH: You sure ?
MOUNA: Yes . I would remember this .
MR. SHAH: Did you move ?
MOUNA: Yes . Eventually we had to . But we had our mail advanced .
MR. SHAH: Well , it would n't be the first time that happened . And pre 9/11 it was n't much of a priority tracking people down .
WALTER: So if they did n't get the lette then does this help us ?
MR. SHAH: It keeps our chances alive . If they got it and just ignored it then we could n't push to reopen the case .
MOUNA: So you can help him ?
MR. SHAH: It 's still a long shot . Like I said , the Government 's approach has changed radically .
MOUNA: Lucky ?
MR. SHAH: Relatively speaking . We just have to move quickly to get an emergency stay from the board of immigration . Then , we 'll stick with the motion to reopen pending his green card application .
MOUNA: Can you explain what that means ?
MR. SHAH: Actually , I do n't have the time ight now . I have to be in court very shortly
MOUNA: How long will he be in detention ?
MR. SHAH: I ca n't predict that . I 'm sorry but I am gon na have to wrap this up .
MOUNA: Do you have children , Mr. Shah ?
MR. SHAH: Yeah . Two kids . And for what it 's worth my uncle was deported afte aising a family here for twenty- three years . If I can get Tarek out , I will .
MOUNA: Thank you . Where are you from ?
MR. SHAH: Queens .
MOUNA: Which one is she ?
WALTER: There . In the middle .
MOUNA: The black woman ? That is Zainab ?
WALTER: Yes .
MOUNA: She is very black .
ZAINAB: Walter ?
WALTER: Hi Zainab . This is Mouna Khalil . Tarek 's mother .
ZAINAB: Oh .
MOUNA: Hello , Zainab .
ZAINAB: It is a pleasure to meet you , Mrs. Khalil .
MOUNA: Please . Call me Mouna .
ZAINAB: OK . I 'm sorry . I did not know you were coming .
MOUNA: Neither did I .
ZAINAB: Thank you .
MOUNA: Do you have time for coffee or a walk ?
ZAINAB: Yes . I would like that . But I have to watch my table .
MOUNA: Why ?
ZAINAB: I do n't know . Have you spoken with Tarek ?
MOUNA: Yes . He called me this morning . He is doing all right .
ZAINAB: I wish that I could see him . Just for a minute .
MOUNA: Me too . How long have you been here ?
ZAINAB: Two years . I was in detention when I first arrived . Three months . It was horrible . I would probably still be there but they closed the facility for poor conditions . They eleased some of the women on parole because we werelow risk . I met Tarek one year later . I am sorry for what happened with Tarek . I hope you do not blame me .
MOUNA: Blame you ? No . I do not blame you .
ZAINAB: Tarek was doing nothing wrong . I miss him so much . I do n't know what I am going to do without him .
MOUNA: He said the same thing about you .
ZAINAB: He did ?
MOUNA: Yes .
ZAINAB: What ?
MOUNA: I would like you to show me something that you and Tarek liked to do . Some place that you like to go .
ZAINAB: Like what ?
MOUNA: Anything . Whatever you want .
ZAINAB: OK . But maybe we should get Walte first .
MOUNA: So what is in Staten Island ?
ZAINAB: I do n't know . We never got off . We just would go to the other side and then come back .
WALTER: Why ?
ZAINAB: It 's free . And it felt like we were going somewhere .
MOUNA: Can you go up in the Statue ?
WALTER: Yes . I think so .
MOUNA: You have n't been ?
WALTER: No .
MOUNA: Oh .
WALTER: Excuse me . Hello ? Oh . Hi Charles .
TAREK: You went on the ferry ?
WALTER: Yes .
TAREK: My mother too ?
WALTER: Yes . She liked it .
TAREK: Did Zainab tell you how we used pretend we arriving in New York fo the first time ?
WALTER: Yeah . She told us .
TAREK: You know they do n't even let us outside here . They just cut a hole in the roof in one place .
WALTER: Really ?
TAREK: Yeah . It 's crazy stuff .
WALTER: Yes . I think your mother likes he very much .
TAREK: My mother 's not going home , is she ?
WALTER: I do n't think so .
TAREK: I know she 's thinking about my father . He spent seven years in jail in Syria for something he wrote in the newspaper . By the time they released him he was very sick . He died two months later . That 's when we came here .
WALTER: I 'm sorry .
TAREK: She thinks the same thing is gon na happen to me .
WALTER: Are you hungry , Mouna ? We can stop for dinner .
MOUNA: I would prefer to cook if you do n't mind ?
WALTER: OK .
MOUNA: Should we stop at a market ?
WALTER: Yeah . That 's probably a good idea .
MOUNA: No thank you .
WALTER: Mouna ? I need to go back to Connecticut tomorrow . For work . I told Tarek .
MOUNA: How long will you be gone ?
WALTER: I do n't know yet . I 'll try to make it back to visit Tarek as soon as I can .
MOUNA: You do n't have keep visiting him , Walter . I 'm sure you are busy .
WALTER: I 'll see what I can do .
MOUNA: OK. Dinner will be ready soon .
WALTER: Broadway ? Uhm . No . I have n't been in a long time .
MOUNA: Tarek sent me the CD for `` Phantom of the Opera '' for my birthday . The music is lovely . Have you seen it ?
WALTER: No . I have n't .
MOUNA: I have n't either but I think I know every word .
WALTER: Tarek is teaching me the drum .
MOUNA: Really ? How is it going ?
WALTER: Well , I sound a lot better when he 's playing with me .
MOUNA: How is your teaching going , Walter ?
WALTER: My teaching ?
MOUNA: Yes .
WALTER: WellI have a lighter schedule so I can work on my book .
MOUNA: Your book ? What is it about ?
WALTER: Well , it covers quite a bit , so it 's hard to explain .
MOUNA: Are you almost finished ?
WALTER: I 'm close .
MOUNA: You do n't like to talk about you work ?
WALTER: No . It 's just a bit complicated .
MOUNA: Why is that ?
WALTER: It just is . It 's just not a process that 's easy to talk about with someone who 's not a writer .
MOUNA: I did n't mean to pry .
WALTER: I should n't have spoken to you like that .
MOUNA: It 's OK .
WALTER: Thank you . You have my number if you need anything .

WALTER: To where ?
TAREK: I do n't know . I think to othe detention centers . Two Moroccan guys were just moved . They had no idea . Suddenly they were just gone .
WALTER: Has anyone said anything to you ?
TAREK: No one in here knows anything . I 'm not a criminal . I have committed no crime . What do they think ? I 'm a terrorist ? There are no terrorists in here . The terrorists have money . They have support . This is not fair !
WALTER: I know .
TAREK: How do you know ? ! You 're out there !
